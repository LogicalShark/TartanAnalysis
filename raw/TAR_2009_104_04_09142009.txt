Hispanic community 
celebrates heritage
TURIALCOSER
Junior Staffwriter
“Being a Latino is definitely 
more than growing up in a Latin 
American country, speaking 
Spanish, or enjoying Latin food; 
it’s an innate attraction to do a 
little foot work when you hear 
salsa, to add extra sazon to food, 
and to celebrate all things spe­
cific to Latin culture,” said Ale­
jandro Fernandez, a senior com­
puter science major and former 
president of SALSA, the Spanish 
and Latino Student Association.
Hispanics across the nation 
will begin celebrating their rich 
variety of cultures this Wednes­
day as a result of President Lyn­
don B. Johnson’s declaration of 
Hispanic Heritage Week, later 
changed to the month-long cel­
ebration from Sept. 15-Oct. 15. 
The month gives Hispanics the 
chance to share their culture, 
their music, food, and entertain­
ment, with everyone.
Hispanic Heritage Month 
commences at Carnegie Mellon 
this Friday with a Hispanic Net­
working Event at 5 p.m. in the 
Peter and McKenna rooms, fol­
lowed by the University Center 
late-night event “Noche Latina”
on Saturday, Sept. 19.
The Office of Student Affairs 
will release further information 
about events planned through­
out the next month.
Last year, nearly 300 people 
attended the popular “Noche 
Latina” late-night event.
“A big event celebrating His­
panic Heritage Month was miss­
ing when I came to CMU,” said 
Lynna Martinez, an academic 
adviser in the Carnegie Mel­
lon Advising Resource Center 
(CMARC), from whom the con­
cept of the event came.
“It’s about music, dance, art, 
food, and inviting everyone to 
partake in the Hispanic cul­
ture.”
Last month, the nation read 
headlines of the newest associ­
ate justice of the Supreme Court, 
Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina 
to hold this position. Her elec­
tion represents the growing rep­
resentation of Latin Americans 
in government.
About 46.9 million Hispanics 
currently reside in the United 
States as of July 1, 2008, accord­

Rewards program draws crowds

ALEXANDRA RIEDL
Junior Staffwriter
The Tartan Rewards Program 
is a new spirit initiative that will 
track student attendance at select 
intercollegiate events throughout 
the year and reward participants. 
The idea behind the Tartans Re­
wards Program spawned from 
last year’s football program. “We 
realized how many students en­
joyed the many giveaways that 
came out of Jared and Pooja’s 
football fever initiative last year, 
but we decided to go in a slightly 
different direction,” said Rotimi 
Abimbola, a senior social and 
decision sciences major and Stu­
dent Body President.
Some of the benefits of partici­
pation in the Tartan Rewards Pro­
gram are giveaways and prizes, 
a chance to earn points for your 
team toward the Tartan Olym­
pics, and a $500 grand prize. 
Winners could also earn tickets 
for the end-of-the-year raffle and 
attend the SuperFan Banquet at 
the end of the year. The Student 
Athlete Advisory Council will su­
pervise a check-in table at each 
of the Rewards Games. Students 
must bring a student ID card to 
receive credit for attendance at 
the games.
The development of the pro­
gram came from looking at the
programs at similar schools. “We 
found out that schools like Em­
ory have very similar programs 
that reward students for high at­
tendance at athletic events,” said 
Abimbola. “We have tailored our 
Rewards Program to the Carn­
egie Mellon community and we 
are continually making efforts to 
enhance the new program.”
Abimbola and Student Body 
Vice President Adam Klein un­
derstand the desires of Tartan 
athletes. “As athletes at Carnegie 
Mellon, Adam and I saw a need to 
rally the student body around the 
impressive sport teams that we 
have at Carnegie Mellon,” said 
Abimbola.
Cheerleading team captains 
Amanda Wilczynski and Carolyn 
Johnson commented on their job 
as cheerleaders and the impor­
tance of fans. “Fans’ being pres­
ent at games helps to boost school 
spirit and pride,” said Wilczynski, 
a senior professional writing and 
English double major said.
“A cheerleader’s job is to moti­
vate and inspire the crowd. But 
if no one is there, we serve no 
purpose. CMU is a community, 
and when a sports team is per­
forming, fellow students should 
go out and support them,” said 
Johnson, a junior civil engineer-

Service fair attracts students
DOMINIQUE DAVIS
Junior Staffwriter
On Sept. 9, Carnegie Mellon 
opened its doors to a variety of 
volunteer organizations, turn­
ing Rangos Hall into a venue for 
creating communities through 
volunteering and providing ser­
vices that help benefit people all 
over Pittsburgh.
It is an annual tradition that 
brings dozens of organizations 
to meet the different interests of 
the diversity of students on cam­
pus.
Some of the organizations 
present were Gwen’s Girls — 
which works to empower girls 
ages 8 to 18 to have productive 
futures through gender-specific 
programs, education, and expe­
riences — and Dress for Success, 
which donates professional cloth­
ing to underprivileged women so 
that they can feel more comfort­
able in their work environments.
Jaime Rhodes, the develop­
ment manager for the Crohn’s 
and Colitis Foundation, dis­
cussed the importance of fairs 
like this one.
“It allows students to learn 
about organizations that do not 
have a well-known name. Many 
people have never even heard of 
Crohn’s disease or colitis, so this
fair lets us inform the public and 
also ask for their help.”
Katherine Forsyth, a first-year 
biology major, agrees with that 
sentiment.
“I found the volunteer fair to 
be very helpful because I was 
able to find a bunch of organiza­
tions that I wouldn’t have heard 
of if I didn’t come.”
Students who weren’t able to 
come to the fair still have a vari­
ety of options available to them 
to get information on various 
volunteering opportunities on 
campus and in the Pittsburgh 
area.
Elizabeth Vaughan, a coor­
dinator for Student Activities, 
wants students to know that if 
they ever have a question about 
volunteer opportunities, they are 
welcome to come to the office of 
Student Activities located in the 
University Center.
“We will be more than willing 
to hook students up with organi­
zations that spark their interest. 
Students can also visit www. 
cmu.edu/service to find out 
about some of the opportunities 
they may have missed.”
For students who are worried 
about the time commitment 
but still want to get involved, 
Student Activities has set up a 
Service Saturday, when they
transport students to a different 
volunteer location every Satur­
day morning. Students can work 
every weekend or just once.
Emily Lambert, an AmeriCorps 
Scholar in Service, said, “There 
is a stigma that volunteering has 
to be a huge commitment. But 
volunteering can be whatever 
you want. It can be every day or 
it can be a one-time thing.”
Jim Bruhn, a volunteer and 
basketball coach for The Pitts­
burgh Project, an organization 
that works to build a community 
in which people can feel safe 
sitting out on their porches, 
said he was happy to be 
at the fair. “I am touched 
by the number of CMU 
students that visited the 
fair. We respect them all 
for coming.”
Successful volunteer 
programs in the past in­
clude the lOOOplus program 
from last semester.
The campus participates in 
one day of service in which many 
activities are occurring in Pitts­
burgh as well as on campus.
The goal of the program is to 
get 1000 students to volunteer 
for the day. Check with Student 
Activities for information about 
lOOOplus and other volunteer 
opportunities.Dining exhibits new options

Free food was available throughout 
the University Center last Tuesday as 
the campus was presented with a Taste 
of the Tartans, a Dining Services show­
case of all the dining options available 
on campus. Rangos Hall was home to this 
endeavor where students sampled food 
from the new café that will arrive in the 
Gates Center as well as food from the com­
pany in charge of our vending machines.
“It was a good way for people who may 
not be on a meal plan to get a taste of the 
food on campus without having to dip into 
our pockets,” said Chakana Mentore, a ju­
nior history major. “I was really impressed 
by the quality of the food. It really makes me 
consider jumping back on the meal plan next 
year.”
Along with the food vendors, tables were 
set up to represent green practices, offering 
information and tips on how to be environ­
mentally conscious. Dining Services also set 
up a table where entries into a raffle for prizes 
were being taken. Winners could receive cou­
pons for discounts at vendors on campus.
“I like that Dining Services is being more in­
teractive with the students this year. With the 
addition of CulinArt, I’ve noticed more reasons
for students to get excited about eating on cam­
pus, such as the coupon cards and the discounts 
often offered at the different eating locations,” 
said Saskia Op Den Bosch, a junior cognitive sci­
ence major with a minor in Chinese studies.
Along with featuring the new food available 
on campus, Taste of the Tartans also served to 
promote other changes in dining, such as the 
Monthly Premiere program. This Thursday, in 
the Tartans Pavilion, CulinArt; will sponsor a 
marathon of seasons one and two of the televi­
sion series The Office from 12 p.m. to 9 p.m., fol­
lowed by the season six premiere at 9 p.m.
There are also many other dining special 
events, including half-priced menus, raffles, 
samples, and nutritional advice. Providing 
healthy eating options was a student concern 
that Dining Services wanted to address.
“We know [students] have enough to think 
about without worrying about [their] next 
healthy meal,” said Anna Bullet, one of the cu­
linary and nutrition specialists available to the 
campus community.
“I really appreciate Dining Services’ interac­
tion with the student body and how they really 
care about our opinions and concerns,” said Ed­
uardo Benatuil, a junior economics and global 
politics major and member of Student Senate. 
“When Kim Abel came to speak at our Senate 
meeting, she demonstrated that [Dining Ser­
vices] is invested in pleasing the campus.”

Keynote speaker for Career Express Weekend
Formerly known as Tech Sunday, the Career Express Weekend was two days of workshops, 
presentations, and speakers informing listerners on job-related topics, such as resume and 
cover letter writing, and understanding and negotiating a job offer. Donald Asher has inter­
viewed thousands of graduate students and admissions directors across the country and spoke 
about how to gain admission to highly competitive graduate schools.
Statistically Speaking
President Obama has been pushing the health care issue very heavily. 
However, during his last weekly address, he stressed the urgency of 
health care reform with new statistics from the Census Bureau that 
people may not have been aware of. Here are some of the statistics 
Obama mentioned, and more about health insurance in America:
Percentage of people under age 65 who have gone 
without coverage for at least one month in the past 
decade:
Number of people uninsured in 2008:
Number of people under 18 uninsured:
Number of people aged 18-64 with work experi­
ence who are uninsured:
Number of families without health insurance:

Gates speaks at building dedicationFighting hunger issue in America
Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft and 
a co-chair and trustee of the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation, will speak 
Sept. 22 at the dedication of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Gates Hillman Complex.
The newly constructed complex is 
connected to other areas of campus 
with the still-under-construction Randy 
Pausch Memorial Bridge, located next 
to the main entrance to the Purnell 
Center for the Arts.
The Gates Hillman Complex already 
houses 318 faculty offices along with 
more space for labs, computer clus­
ters, lecture halls, classrooms, and a 
250-seat auditorium, not to mention a 
Planetary Robotics Center with a high 
bay workspace.
Gates, whose foundation contributed
$20 million toward the construction of 
the complex, along with $10 million 
from the Henry Hillman Foundation, 
will present the keynote address at the 
dedication ceremony. Hillman will also 
be in attendance.
If you would like to learn more about 
the Gates Hillman Complex, attend the 
Sept. 22 “virtual” ribbon cutting cer­
emony, which culminates with Gates’ 
address in Wiegand Gym at 3 p.m. for 
1200 invited guests.
Afterward, from 4:30 to 6 p.m., the 
complex will be open to the public to 
tour and view exhibits of research proj­
ects submitted by faculty and students.
Joel Berg, the executive director of 
the New York City Coalition Against 
Hunger, will appear on campus next 
Thursday at 4:30 p.m. in Porter 100, 
Gregg Hall, to talk about hunger is­
sues in America. Berg is a nationally 
recognized leader in the fields of hun­
ger, food, and community assistance.
In his lecture, he will examine how 
past and current administrations had 
been preparing to deal with this un­
fortunate problem, which affects up­
ward of 36 million Americans, along 
with his own ideas and solutions on 
the matter.
He will also discuss and attempt 
to explain how the mainstream me­
dia and other organizations, such as 
charities and elected officials, have
displayed the problem, and even con­
tributed toward it. And don’t think 
Berg is set with merely taking on 
one end of the spectrum — he has 
denounced organic health food gurus 
right alongside the fast food industry.

they are your fellow students here 
at Carnegie Mellon University. 
However, often the music, food, 
and entertainment extinguish 
the rich historical significance of 
Hispanics in America.
Spaniard Juan Ponce de León 
led the first confirmed landing in 
the continental United States in 
1513 on a shore he called La Flor­
ida, later the state of Florida.
The Spanish became the first 
Europeans to reach the Appala­
chian Mountains, the Mississippi 
River, the Grand Canyon, and the 
Great Plains.
Today, national organizations 
like LULAC, the League of United 
Latin American Communities, 
champion efforts for civil rights 
for Latinos in the United States.
While the historical signifi­
cance of Hispanics ranges from 
César Chávez and Dolores Huerta 
organizing migrant workers to
the 1960s Chicano Movement, 
the importance shifts toward the 
21st century, a period in which 
Carnegie Mellon takes a role in 
offering Hispanics the opportu­
nity to become future industry 
leaders.
The State of Diversity at Carn­
egie Mellon University annual re­
port states that Hispanic students 
comprise 5 percent of the campus 
community.
“Because of the small Hispanic 
population on campus, the La­
tino community really doesn’t 
thrive here at CMU,” said Chris­
tian Aponte, a first-year aspiring 
Hispanic studies major.
“Hispanic Heritage Month 
provides that distinct time of the 
year where Hispanics at Carnegie 
Mellon are free to express their 
culture and share it with others 
who have not had the opportu­
nity to learn what we are about.”
Dorms compete for green title
SABRINA PORTER nior public policy and manage-
Personnel Manager
House Wars have returned 
to Carnegie Mellon. Except this 
time, all dorms are in the mix 
and are competing to be the most 
carbon-efficient residence hall 
on campus. StepGreen, a new 
computer program led by Carn­
egie Mellon’s Human-Computer 
Interaction (HCI) Institute, sep­
arates each dorm and tracks ev­
ery student’s daily actions while 
judging them based on the level 
of carbon emissions. Dorms are 
competing to have the lowest 
daily carbon score.
The competition has already 
begun, and as of Saturday morn­
ing, Morewood E Tower is lead­
ing the way. Morewood Gardens, 
Margaret Morrison Apartments, 
and Stever House follow, respec­
tively.
, “I think the element of com­
petition will encourage some 
people to at least evaluate their 
level of emissions, if not reduce 
them,” said Lizzy Madden, a se-
ment major.
Once registered with 
StepGreen, a student is asked to 
input his or her daily actions. The 
program not only immediately 
calculates the carbon emitted 
and adds points to their dorm, 
but additionally provides the 
student with feedback for rec­
ommended alternatives and the 
money and carbon that would be 
saved.
“It is a grassroots effort to 
bring change at an individual 
level — motivating people to 
live green,” said Pratibha Singh, 
a graduate student at Carnegie 
Mellon and part of the HCI initia­
tive. “All our actions create some 
kind of waste. Over-consumption 
of natural resources in an unsus­
tainable manner without even 
being aware of the damage we 
are causing is a problem today.”
Carnegie Mellon already leads 
the way in green dormitories, 
but Singh suggests that green 
living goes beyond green build­
ings, such as Stever House, that
are LEED certified.
“I remember one student men­
tioned that Stever House would 
easily beat every other dorm in 
the green dorm competition we 
are holding,” she said.
“A green building is differ­
ent from green living. You may 
have ^ green building, but if your 
day-to-day habits are overly con­
sumptive, it causes carbon di­
oxide emissions that could have 
been avoided.”
The site provides detailed feed­
back in carbon emissions and al­
ternative savings. Setting a com­
puter to automatically hibernate, 
for example, saves almost $50, as 
well as about 617 pounds of car­
bon emitted, per year. Recycling 
newspapers and magazines saves 
almost 30,000 and 8000 pounds 
of carbon emitted, respectively. 
The site is full of these types of 
actions, and their resulting car­
bon footprints.

ing up can go to cmu.stepgreen.

Tartans fans rewarded for spirit

ing and Spanish double major.
Fans like Joe Frick understand 
their importance and are very 
supportive of the Tartans.
“You want to contribute to 
the game in any way possible, 
whether it’s screaming, cheer­
ing, whatever. It allows you to 
show your Tartan pride,” said 
Frick, a first-year computational 
finance major.
Because of fans like Frick, the 
Tartan Rewards Program’s top 
fans will be rewarded for their 
attendance.
“When the game isn’t going 
in our favor and we have to tell 
each other to keep our heads up, 
seeing and hearing fans reminds 
us that we’re playing for more 
than ourselves,” said Evan Moss, 
a first-year mechanical engineer­
ing major and football player.
Abimbola says that student 
government worked closely with 
the Career and Professional De­
velopment Center, the Athletic 
Department, the Student Athlete
Advisory Council, and Carnegie 
Clan.
“We are [also] in the process of 
reaching out to major corporate 
sponsors to supply prizes for stu­
dents that come to several ath­
letic events,” said Abimbola.
The attendees of last Satur­
day’s football game against Ohio 
Wesleyan got free T-shirts offered

Polluted water 
harms citizens
The Hall-Massey family in 
Charleston, W. Va., has expe­
rienced horrible scabs on their 
arms, legs, and chest from pain­
ful rashes, as well as decaying 
teeth. This is due to the tap 
water that runs in their home. 
Tests show that their tap water 
contains such chemicals as ar­
senic, barium, lead, and man­
ganese. Chemicals like these at 
such high concentrations could 
contribute to damage to the 
kidneys or nervous systems, or 
even cancer.
The Hall-Masseys are cur­
rently suing nine nearby coal 
companies for putting danger­
ous toxins in the water. It seems 
that this incident is part of a 
rising number of violations of 
the Clean Water Act that began 
many years ago.

Scientists find 
MRSA at beaches
For the first time, a danger­
ous staph bacteria has been dis­
covered in the sand and water 
at five public beaches. Methi- 
cillin-resistant Staphyococcus 
aureus (MRSA) has been found 
along the coast of Washington, 
but scientists think that other 
states may also have this prob­
lem. MRSA infections are very 
difficult to treat and are usually 
rarely seen outside of hospitals. 
This bacterium causes skin in­
fections and pneumonia, and is 
spread mostly through human 
contact. The fact that this germ 
exists at the beach must mean 
that people are picking it up 
and transmitting the bacteria 
at a higher level than scientists 
had originally thought.

H1N1 spreads 
across the nation
Health officials, on Sept. 11, 
announced that swine flu has 
now spread to all 50 states and 
the District of Columbia. H1N1 
now represents the cause of the 
majority of the nation’s flu. Anne 
Schuchat, head of the National 
Center for Immunization and 
Respiratory Diseases, says that 
98 percent of the viruses circu­
lating are this H1N1 strain, the 
highest percentage that health 
officials have seen this early in 
the season. She explains that 
widespread vaccination against 
the flu would reduce its spread. 
A single 15-microgram dose of 
the H1N1 vaccine is well-toler­
ated and could boost immune 
response in healthy adults. 
Around 45 million doses of this 
vaccine are expected to be de­
livered by mid-October.

Gene for Alzheimer’s 
affects all differently
The gene variant known as 
APOE4, which increases the risk 
of Alzheimer’s disease, affects 
the brains of people in the mid- 
20s differently. In a study of 24 
healthy adults, 12 of whom had 
the gene variation, both groups 
that had performed a series of 
memory tests achieved similar 
scores.
However, those with the 
gene variation have brains that 
are working harder or less effi­
ciently. Co-author of the study, 
Jeffery Browndyke, director of 
the Functional Imaging Neu­
rogenomics of Disease Lab at 
Duke University, believes this 
gene still needs further studies 
to determine its true effect on 
brain development and cogni­
tive function of those who are at 
risk for Alzheimer’s.

Last week, Douglas Boucher of the Union of Concerned Scientists lectured at the University Lecture Series. Boucher, pictured above, introduced ways 
in which we can help protect the environment and how the G20 can serve that purpose.
DIPIKA SHRIHARI
Junior Staffwriter
On Sept. 10, Carnegie Mellon’s 
University Lecture Series guest 
speaker Douglas Boucher gave a 
talk on the importance of climate 
change education and the prob­
lems with deforestation.
Boucher, an active member of 
the Union of Concerned Scien­
tists and previously a professor 
at the University of Quebec and 
McGill University, said he treads 
a fine line between academics 
and politics.
“Currently, I’m a recovering 
academic. It’s nice to be back in 
an academic setting, especially 
since there is a lot going on right 
now involving climate change 
around the world,” Boucher said. 
“And fortunately, it’s all coming 
to town.” What Boucher refer­
enced is the G20 Summit that 
is drawing nearer. “The Obama 
administration specifically chose 
Pittsburgh for this meeting as an 
example of what can be done in 
terms of a transition from an old 
energy economy to a new energy 
economy,” Boucher said.
He highlighted that one of the 
only ways to have changes made 
in politics is through public pres­
sure. Boucher advised students 
to get involved, in one way or an-
other,in the G20 Summit.
In his lecture, Boucher talked 
about the possibilities that could 
happen if conversations like the 
G20 went well. Boucher brought 
out a map of tl\e world, skewed 
to show each country’s size pro­
portional to its carbon emission. 
Then, in a diagram of countries 
who are supportive of environ­
mental action and those who 
have power, Boucher showed 
that many of the G20 members 
are holding back in terms of en­
vironmental activism.
“Some countries like Japan 
are way up there in support,” 
Boucher said. “Then there are 
the possible deal breakers. These 
countries, like Saudi Arabia and 
Russia, don’t want there to be an 
agreement on climate change for 
obvious reasons.”
He also noted that some less 
powerful groups, such as the As­
sociation of Small Nation States, 
literally see climate change as a 
threat to their existence because 
a small increase in water levels 
could wipe out entire groups and 
islands. He also noted the impact 
climate change could have on 
Pittsburgh locals.
“If we go by the business-as- 
usual scenario, we are going 
to shift the climate in western 
Pennsylvania so that, by the end
of the century, it resembles the 
climate we have in Alabama,” 
Boucher said.
He stated possible scenarios 
of how our world’s future could 
look, depending on our actions. If 
we curb our emissions by over 80 
to 90 percent, Boucher claimed 
that we could live in a world 
with relatively low environmen­
tal damage. Boucher’s message 
to students, and the focus of his 
research, is to prove that this fan­
tastic feat can be done, and it can 
be accomplished in a way that is 
not only economically feasible, 
but also economically beneficial 
to us.
Boucher explained this using 
an analogy of his newly pur­
chased hybrid car. Even though 
his car was an expensive invest­
ment, he ended up saving money 
after a few years due to the 
amount he would have otherwise 
spent on gas. An environmental 
group that Boucher is part of, the 
Union of Concerned Scientists, 
showed a study to explain how 
it is practical and realistic to cut 
our energy consumption by 2 
percent over the next decade, 
and do it efficiently.
Boucher is sure of the possibili­
ties for improvement because he 
believes it is American politics to 
try every other solution before
policymakers arrive at the right 
answer.
“We always do the right thing 
after we’ve tried everything else. 
I think we are getting to our 
Churchill-ian moment where ev­
erything we have done has failed, 
so now we are finally going to do 
the right thing,” Boucher said.
Boucher said that Carnegie 
Mellon is a hotspot for green 
technologies and it is crucial that, 
as a school, students take initia­
tive to constantly improve these 
technologies and make climate 
change goals more feasible.
He concluded by noting how 
the changes made now will affect 
our future. “Our grandchildren 
are going to live in a planet and 
atmosphere based upon our deci­
sion and the ones made in Pitts­
burgh in the next few weeks,” he 
said.
Indira Nair, the Vice Provost 
of Education, saw this lecture as 
a crucial part to educating Car­
negie Mellon students about cli­
mate change.
“We only see the storm [of 
climate change catastrophes] in 
temperature changes. We don’t 
have the eyes to see the storm, 
and this lecture really helps us 
have the eyes to see it,” Nair said. 
“It was a truly exemplary talk for 
an educated public.”
How Things Work: Ozone depletion

ozone thickness over the earth. The dark central portion of the figure

AKANKSHA VAIDYA

Climate change, global warm­
ing, and ozone depletion are is­
sues that have been discussed 
time and time again in the past
few years. These issues basically 
boil down to two main points — 
first, that we are harming the en­
vironment, and second, that our 
actions are ultimately harming 
us.
However, what exactly is hap­
pening to the environment that
is so harmful for us? And more 
importantly, what is it that we 
are doing to harm the environ­
ment?
While the topic of environ­
mental damage is very vast, this 
article will address the issue in 
terms of one of the many prob­
lems we are facing today — that 
of ozone depletion.
To understand what the prob­
lem we face is, it is important to 
have a little background infor­
mation on the subject.
Earth’s atmosphere is divided 
into five main layers, starting 
from the nearest to the surface 
of the earth and going upward. 
These are, respectively, the tro­
posphere, the stratosphere, the 
mesosphere, the thermosphere, 
and finally the exosphere.
The ozone layer is found in the 
second layer, the stratosphere. 
This layer is made up of ozone 
molecules, which are made up of 
oxygen.
While each molecule of the 
atmospheric oxygen that we 
breathe in is made up of two at­
oms of oxygen, ozone is made 
up of three. This change makes 
ozone vastly different from at­
mospheric oxygen.
For one thing, ozone is blue 
in color and has a characteristic 
odor, and for another, the ozone 
layer is able absorb radiation that 
comes from the sun.
As explained on www.nas. 
nasa.gov when an oxygen mol­
ecule absorbs a short wavelength 
photon of light, the energy causes
the molecule to split into two at­
oms of oxygen. One of these at­
oms collides with another two- 
atom oxygen molecule, forming 
a molecule of three atoms of oxy­
gen — ozone. A similar splitting 
process occurs with the ozone 
molecules when they are broken 
down.
Ozone formation and destruc­
tion thus goes on continuously, 
maintaining a constant ozone 
concentration. This cycle of 
ozone destruction and produc­
tion is the reason behind the 
layer’s ability to absorb the radia­
tion, especially the harmful ul­
traviolet radiation, coming from 
the sun.
A portion of ultraviolet light, 
called UVB, is especially harm­
ful, as it can cause cataracts and 
a variety of skin cancers, damage 
crops, and also harm marine and 
wild life.
As long as the ozone layer con­
tinued to absorb this radiation, 
the Earth was safe.
However, with the thinning of 
the ozone layer, exposure to this 
radiation has become a serious 
concern.
This raises the question of why 
the ozone layer is thinning in the 
first place.
Elements like chlorine act 
as catalysts in the breakdown 
of ozone. This means that they 
speed up the process of ozone 
breakdown without altering or 
getting depleted.
See OZONE, pageA5
Google in 2007 announced 
that it would start scientific re­
search in many areas, including 
areas of green energy sources. 
Currently, Google is looking 
into developing cheap solar 
panels that would cut costs by 
at least 25 percent.
Google is trying to do this 
by using different materials to 
construct the reflective mirrors 
of solar panels; these mirrors 
would cost one half of the cur­
rent price of mirrors.
Although there is potential 
in this idea, the lack of govern­
ment funding is slowing the 
process for further studies in 
green technology and testing of 
cost-effective solar panels.

Scientists find cause 
of potato famine
The Irish potato famine oc­
curred in the 1840s and 1850s, 
and scientists have now un­
locked the genetic code of po­
tato famine. The potato famine 
was caused by a plant pathogen 
called the Phytophthora infes- 
tans.
The genome of the Phy­
tophthora infestans is very large, 
and this allowed the pathogen 
to take over the potato.
The size of the pathogen’s 
DNA is so large that it is similar 
to the size of an animal’s DNA. 
The pathogen’s DNA is large 
since 75 percent of the genome 
is filled with repetitive DNA 
that appears to evolve quickly. 
Scientists believe that this large 
size enabled the pathogen to 
infect potatoes that were ge­
netically modified to resist such 
pathogenic attack.

Open source soft­
ware helps cameras
Stanford scientists are on a 
mission to reinvent digital pho­
tography by designing open 
source software for digital cam­
eras. This will allow a commu­
nity of programmers to develop 
new tools for digital cameras. 
No longer will a camera’s per­
formance depend on the manu­
facturer’s software, but more on 
a worldwide developing com­
munity.
The open source camera can 
be modified in many ways, in­
cluding focus, exposure, shut­
ter speed, and flash. The open 
source software will be made 
public with a year, and it might 
be a while before your next 
Canon or Nikon runs on open 
source.

Ozone depletion poses significant threat to countries across world
OZONE, from A4
According to an article on 
www.epa.gov, one molecule of 
chlorine can degrade more than
100,000 molecules of ozone be­
fore it is removed from the atmo­
sphere.
With atoms like chlorine pres­
ent in the atmosphere, ozone 
gets depleted faster than it is 
recreated, and this results in the 
depletion of the ozone layer.
Initially, chlorine was not much 
of a threat to the ozone layer as 
there was hardly any chlorine 
that high up in the atmosphere.
However, with the advance­
ment of technology, this scenario 
changed.
As the article explained, sci­
ence came up with new so-called 
“miracle substances” — chloro- 
fluorocarbons (CFCs).
CFCs were not very toxic, not 
flammable, and very cheap to 
produce.
Industries therefore flocked to­
ward these substances and used 
them in a variety of applications
— in hair sprays, as refrigerants, 
and in a variety of different sol­
vents.
It was not until the 1970s that 
people began to realize the harm­
ful effects of CFCs. CFCs contain
chlorine, but unlike many other 
chlorine-containing agents, CFCs 
are very hard to destroy. Most 
chlorine-containing compounds 
dissolve in water and come back 
down to the earth through rain. 
CFCs, however, do not dissolve in 
water.
Hence, they cannot come 
down with rain and end up going 
higher and higher in the atmo­
sphere. Ultimately, they reach the 
stratosphere, where the chlorine 
in them harms the ozone layer.
Although CFCs are not the 
only substances that harm the 
ozone layer, they make up the 
majority of ozone-harming sub­
stances. The result of all these 
CFC emissions is that there is 
now a “hole” in the ozone layer 
that centers on Antarctica.
The thickness of the ozone 
layer over a particular region 
changes with the season.
The ozone hole over Antarc­
tica is not really an area with no 
ozone, but one with a very thin 
layer.
NASA satellites have been 
keeping a tab on the thickness 
of the ozone layer over this area 
and send readings every day.
However, it is not only Ant­
arctica that has to worry about 
ozone depletion.
The U.S. Environmental Pro­
tection Agency cites a study in 
which it was discovered that 
ozone levels in the middle 
latitudes — where most popu­
lated nations lie — decreased by
10 percent during the winter and 
by 8 percent during the summer. 
From 1973 to 2001, ozone levels 
have decreased by 2.3 percent 
every 10 years.
Although these statistics 
are somewhat depressing, 
governments around the world 
have taken steps to protect the 
world from the harms of ozone 
depletion.
The Montreal protocol was
signed in 1987. However, it was 
not until the year 1996 that the 
countries that had signed the 
protocol completely stopped the 
production of CFCs. Although no 
more CFCs were released into the 
atmosphere after this point, the 
harm that was done was already 
quite great.
However, pacts like the 
Montreal protocol were useful in 
curbing the subsequent damage 
to the environment.
Although harm has already 
been done to the environment, 
pacts like this have ensured that 
we do not harm the environment 
any more.

Health Talk: Alcohol metabolization
BRIAN LEE
Stafjwriter
Partying, and consequently 
alcohol, has always been a large 
part of college life. But while you 
are partying, your body remains 
at work processing and removing 
the alcohol from your body. This 
issue of Health Talk discusses 
how the body deals with alcohol 
and how it is ultimately flushed 
out of the body.
The familiar alcohol in drinks 
is actually an organic compound 
known as ethanol; alcoholic 
drinks are made when it is mixed 
with water and other ingredi­
ents. As soon as it is ingested, it 
starts being absorbed.
Taking a sip of vodka allows al­
cohol to pass through the lining 
of the mouth and throat and be 
absorbed by blood vessels even 
before it reaches the stomach.
Since alcohol is a small and 
simple molecule, it does not need 
to be broken down before being 
taken in by the bloodstream; it 
flows in by diffusion.
Alcohol can also be absorbed 
through the stomach, but in real­
ity, most of the alcohol is taken 
up through the small intestine. 
This is the basis for the “eat be­
fore you drink” doctrine; eating 
beforehand tells the stomach not 
to release its contents to the in­
testine, as the food needs to be 
digested and broken down into 
smaller particles before it can be 
absorbed.
Because the alcohol is blocked
from entering the small intes­
tine, it is not absorbed as quickly. 
The idea that bread “absorbs” al­
cohol, like a sponge, is not actu­
ally true; eating only delays the 
process.
The small intestine is de­
signed to absorb chemicals from 
food and pass them into the 
bloodstream. The alcohol is car­
ried through the bloodstream 
to the liver, where it is further 
processed.
Once absorbed, the liver me­
tabolizes the alcohol with the 
help of an enzyme called alcohol 
dehydrogenase. Alcohol is con­
verted into an acetaldehyde, and 
then further converted to acetic 
acid, which is harmless to the 
body. Acetic acid is further bro­
ken down into carbon dioxide 
and water and is released from 
the body.
An intolerance for alcohol is 
caused by an nonfunctional ver­
sion of alcohol dehydrogenase. 
However, the liver can only pro­
cess a certain amount of alcohol 
at one time; the rest remains in 
the body and is what causes the 
effects of drunkenness.
The unprocessed alcohol in 
the bloodstream travels toward 
the brain.
The brain is usually is pro­
tected from unwanted chemicals 
by a barrier called the blood- 
brain barrier.
However, alcohol is allowed to 
pass into the brain because of its 
molecular shape.
The alcohol reaches the brain
and affects the different lobes 
that are responsible for func­
tions like judgment, balance, 
and speech.
These effects of alcohol on the 
brain give rise to the personality 
change often seen in intoxicated 
people.
The morning-after result of 
intoxication — a hangover — is 
caused by many factors, includ­
ing dehydration and the type 
of alcohol drunk. However, the 
belief “liquor before beer, never 
fear,” may not be entirely accu­
rate; there is no evidence to show 
that order has any effect on the 
feeling one has the next morn­
ing.
In fact, it is thought that con­
geners are one of the causes of 
hangovers. Congeners — toxins 
produced during the fermen­
tation process of making alco­
hols — are found in liquor, and 
darker liquors have more than 
lighter liquors.
Other factors giving rise to 
hangovers are the amount drunk 
and the pace at which one drinks. 
However, it is difficult to judge 
what would cause a bad hang­
over and what would not. Hence, 
the best way to avoid a hangover 
is to limit consumption.
While possibly the most 
common drug among college 
students, alcohol’s danger is eas­
ily the most overlooked.
It is not easy to abstain from 
drinking forever in college, and 
drinking with restraint is the 
best way to stay safe.

Smoking policy changes not being enforced
The maps are posted. The signs are up. 
The little cigarette butt receptacles are in 
plain sight. But is the smoking policy be­
ing enforced?
Of course not.
A common complaint among non- 
smokers is the walk to class behind a 
smoker — it’s quite irritating to breathe 
in someone else’s poison with no way to 
avoid it. In addition to providing a clean 
air environment for all, another goal of 
the smoking policy was to help elimi­
nate litter — namely the cigarette butts 
that are often haphazardly tossed to the 
ground — from all over campus.
The changes to the smoking policy 
underwent a great deal of debate in the 
past year. Committees that were com­
posed of a diverse group of students and
staff were formed to debate the changes 
to the policy that were being considered, 
as well as to decide upon the new areas 
where smoking would be allowed. After 
a preliminary period of time where stu­
dents were warned when they were not 
obeying the new policy but not fined, the 
changes went into effect permanently.
Previously, we strongly speculated that 
once the school year began and the “new” 
smoking policy were fully enforced, very 
few would actually obey the new regu­
lations willingly. We also predicted the 
lack of repercussions that would ensue 
for breaking the smoking policy.
It is true that University Police has 
been a little preoccupied with handling 
a different threat to our campus’s health, 
though with the swine flu subsiding
(hopefully), we wonder if the university 
will now turn its focus to this smoking 
issue on campus and continue with its 
campaign for a healthy campus in 2010.
And if the university is going to focus 
on the newly enforced policy, more needs 
to be done than posting signs in a few lo­
cations around campus. An effort needs 
to be made to ensure that the campus 
community is well educated on the policy 
and all that it entails, and the fines that 
are mentioned on the signs dotting the 
campus need to be actually enforced.
We hope that the university’s attention 
will be turned toward enforcing the poli­
cy and setting a precedent for the future, 
and we look forward to experiencing a 
clean air campus and keeping our lungs 
healthy in the future.
Obama, parents right regarding speech to kids
President Obama’s address to school­
children last Tuesday has been the rea­
son for a large amount of uproar recently. 
Days before the speech was given, it was 
met with opposition from Republicans 
and parents. While the White House 
maintained that the speech was meant 
solely to encourage students to work hard 
in school, many parents were concerned 
about the speech imparting a political 
agenda on their children’s minds.
In order to emphasize the fact the 
speech was not intended to have any po­
litical influence on the children, certain 
controversial lines in the speech were 
rephrased before it was aired. As stated 
on ABCnews.com, the speech originally 
asked the children to “write letters to 
themselves about what they can do to
help the President,” but this line was lat­
er changed to “write letters to themselves 
about how they can achieve their short­
term and long-term education goals.” 
In spite of this, many parents across the 
nation requested that their children be 
allowed to engage in different activities 
during the time of the speech and not be 
forced to hear it.
Wanting to make an impact on the na­
tion’s youth and encourage them to do 
well in school is not a crime. We believe 
that Obama was justified in wanting to 
spread some general advice to the chil­
dren on their first day of school. That 
being said, parents do have the right 
to control what their children see and 
hear at a young age. Not knowing what 
the contents of the speech were, parents
were rightly concerned about the speech 
influencing their children in the wrong 
way. Their concern does not mean that 
they were completely opposed to the idea 
of the President talking to their children. 
Many parents felt that they should have 
been able to watch the speech in advance 
so that they would know what their chil­
dren would be hearing.
We understand the justifications of 
both the parents of the children and 
Obama in this case. Both were justified 
in their causes and ultimately wanted the 
best for the children of this nation. We 
also hope that in the future, the President 
can take advantage of the usage of differ­
ent forms of media and technology, and 
post his video to YouTube for parents’ ap­
proval before it’s shown to children.
New law could eliminate public urination in city
Drunk college students in the city of 
Pittsburgh, take note: Before this week, 
it hasn’t been against the law to urinate 
in public.
The city council tentatively approved a 
proposed ordinance last week that would 
stop people from urinating or defecating 
in public places or on private property 
without permission. This ordinance grew 
out of both Pittsburgh council members’ 
and citizens’ distaste with people using 
the bar-filled South Side neighborhoods 
as public restrooms.
With no law in place, police have been 
forced to resort to state laws to cite of­
fenders, which in some cases would re­
sult in a state charge of lewdness, plac-
ing citizens on the list of registered sex 
offenders.
Council members will meet Tuesday 
where a final vote on the pending legisla­
tion could make the new law permanent. 
If the legislature goes through, the pen­
alty for each violation will be $500.
We at The Tartan are surprised that 
a law against public urination and def­
ecation did not already exist. It’s rather 
amusing to think that prior to this week, 
residents were technically allowed to uri­
nate wherever they so desired.
That being said, we are all for making 
the city cleaner and more livable for the 
city’s residents, and eliminating public 
streets and buildings as bathrooms is def-
initely a step in the right direction.
We all know how badly Porta-Johns 
smell, and it would be great if the city 
was kept from smelling like that as well, 
especially with our already polluted riv­
ers. The law seems to be the ideal way to 
keep the city stench free, and also would 
fill in a legal gap that seems to just be a 
manifestation of one of the rules we all 
learned in kindergarten.
We are glad that the city council is try­
ing to keep public places clean, and we 
applaud Carnegie Mellon students and 
staff for making use of the restroom fa­
cilities on campus instead of taking the 
liberty of relieving themselves on the Cut 
or by the Fence.
Sex and classical music not 
always mutually exclusive
CYNTHIA PENG
“I don’t know how I came upon this. 
I hope I didn’t buy it.” Those were my 
thoughts when I was browsing Tchaik­
ovsky symphonies and happened upon 
a quaint little album entitled “Erotic Sex 
Classical Music.” My instant reflex was 
to navigate away from that page quicker 
than a szforzando. My next thought after 
that was, “what the hell?”
The quote was not mine, but came 
from the sole reviewer of the 2001 album, 
whose cover features an outstretched, 
unclothed back interposed with a violin. 
Brave Sole Reviewer and potential owner 
of the album gave it one out of five stars, 
lamenting that “the music is fine, but 
the effects just sound too contrived.” For 
“Pachelbel’s Canon,” the third track on 
the album, I can see how that’s the case. 
For overall effect, I was pretty intrigued. 
Aforementioned reviewer continued: 
“Sex, I like. Classical music, I like.” Well, 
there you go. Shocking as it may seem, 
the two aren’t that far apart.
Classical music has long held an elitist 
image. With record sales dwindling and 
concert audiences diminishing, classical 
music can no longer pride itself solely on 
virtuosity and genius in this generation, 
especially when this generation has the 
attention span of a 140-character Tweet, 
or when this generation produces Miley 
Cyrus. Either way, the common consum­
er finds classical music too abstruse, too 
stuffy, too “above-the-average-Joe.” A 
theory is that perhaps classical music has 
so few patrons because it only caters to 
an audience of “elitists.” The logical step 
for the survival of classical music was to 
distribute the art form to the masses, and 
in doing so, appeal to the most basic in­
stinct of human nature: sex.
Using sex to sell music is hardly a new 
idea. Wikipedia tells me that Italian op­
era composers such as Verdi and Doni­
zetti scored their works for the allowance 
of exotic, probably very bare dancers. I
also learned from the classic tome Clas­
sical Music for Dummies that the ladies 
would swoon when the handsome pia­
nist Franz Liszt strode onstage. The Har­
vard Dictionary of Music or the NPR Curi­
ous Listener’s Guide won’t tell you that the 
guy that wrote those ballads your sister 
pounds out at home was a total pimp. 
Maybe that’s the problem — that’s what 
pushed people over the edge to try to 
start making “Pachelbel’s Canon” erotic.
I did a little more research into the ap­
parently not mutually exclusive arenas of 
classical music and sex, and by research I 
mean more than your standard American 
Pie band camp joke. When I investigated 
further into using sex to sell classical mu­
sic, I found the strapless gown fashions 
of German violinist Anne Sophie Mutter 
(look it up), the deliciously tight jeans 
of violinist Joshua Bell (really, look this 
one up), and the wet T-shirts of British 
violinist Vanessa Mae (now you’re really 
intrigued to look these up).
Throwing you off a bit? Shocking that 
not all classical musicians are unattract­
ive drones? You mean you didn’t find 
your high school band concerts a prime 
location for spotting hotties?
“Just think of those orchestral musi­
cians perspiring in their tight funeral 
black,” joked Ivan Hewett in the UK Tele­
graph.
So what about the great debate of pro­
ducing music accessible to the masses 
versus preserving its artistic integrity? Is 
there a way for classical music to remain 
true to its highly-educated culture and 
appeal to the average Joe? On the one 
hand, you could build up your CD collec­
tion with the snootiest, highest-quality 
Deutsche Grammophon or Sony Classical 
records (with fully tuxedo-ed maestros 
on the cover, mind you). Or you could 
not be too aware of where you click on 
the “related searches” button and end up 
on the sketchiest Amazon.com product 
page I have ever seen. Classical music can 
throw you a curveball like that.

UC Gallery better suited as meeting room than display space
This is written in response to an article 
that appeared in the Aug. 24 issue ex­
pressing concern for the conversion of the 
UC Art Gallery into a conference room. 
I serve as a coordinator in the Office of 
Student Activities, and I previously was 
responsible for managing the UC Gallery. 
I am also an alumnus of the university, 
having graduated as a studio art major in 
the College of Fine Arts in 2006.
The decision to convert the space was 
a difficult one, but weighing the need for 
this space by our office, the conclusion 
was reached that we needed to expand 
in order to support our work. Our ad­
ministrative office works to support the 
250+ student organizations on campus, 
and the expansion of our office space will 
now serve as a meeting location, a stor­
age space for the materials that we use 
for annual events that we coordinate on 
behalf of students, and office space for 
graduate students and undergraduate 
office assistants that we employ.
What made the proposal for altering 
the space compelling is that in tracking 
participation for exhibitors and specta­
tors, the UC Art Gallery space was under­
utilized. I believe that there were only 
four students who chose to display in the 
space for the entire 2008-2009 year and 
I was in contact with the School of Art 
and members of student organizations to 
try and bolster the schedule. Even with 
some of the most compelling and beau­
tiful shows, it appeared that few people 
would enter the space. The remaining bi­
weekly shows were substantiated by the 
Division of Student Affairs and campus 
partners in support of thematic events 
tied to heritage months or in tandem 
with annual conferences.
As one used to getting down and dirty 
as an art major, I can say with a degree of 
certainty the UC Gallery is not an ideal 
space to display artwork. Artists could 
not nail into the walls, could not alter 
the structure of the space, and could not 
leave the space dirty. All wall-hanging 
works needed to be suspended from a 
track system, which made it difficult to 
display pieces at a uniform height, and 
materials utilized for suspending works 
in the space was a consistent point of 
frustration. Video artwork and installa­
tions were difficult to manage and main­
tain, as closing for the gallery would be 
managed by various individuals from the 
UC staff.
I believe that, given the parameters, 
those displaying in the space found it dif­
ficult to “make it their own,” something 
which is afforded by other spaces on 
campus. One such gallery is The Frame, 
run by students on campus with support 
from our office. Artists looking to display 
on campus are welcome to visit our of­
fice to explore other potential locations. 
The Student Activities staff is committed 
to meeting the needs of our students and 
supporting the wide breadth of interests 
that each of our students has.

Cuban society, not Castro, must change government
MARILUZ ORBAY-CERRATO
There is no Cuba after Castro... 
at least for now. The 83-year-old 
comandante has been subject to 
jokes about his immortality for 
some time now, with good rea­
son. After Queen Elizabeth II, he 
is the one leader who has main­
tained the position of head of 
government for the longest pe­
riod of time.
It is common knowledge that 
stability has never truly found a 
permanent place on Cuban soil, 
and Fidel Castro certainly did 
not fall from the sky straight into 
power. Unfortunately for Cuba, 
Castro has been pretty fortunate. 
His rise to power was carried out 
without any major mishaps, and 
fortunately for him, Castro is a 
smart guy and has, throughout 
the years, perfected the strategy 
that keeps him in control.
Cuba was definitely doing bet­
ter before the establishment of 
Castro’s totalitarian regime in 
1959; however, this is not to say 
that the country was exactly do­
ing well. Fulgencio Batista had 
already taken power by force long 
before that, and it would take pre­
cisely someone like Castro to get 
him off the throne.
Like most leaders of totalitarian 
tendencies, Batista, also known 
as “the Man,” began his political 
career being regarded as a hero. 
A young sergeant in 1933, he led 
a rebellion with labor leaders and 
studeiite against dictator Gerar­
do Machado. Not too long after, 
he conspired with United States 
ambassador Sumner Welles to 
get provisional president Ramon 
Grau San Martin off his seat.
In 1944, however, respecting 
the electorate’s choice, Batista 
returned the presidency. Not long 
after, in 1952, he seized power 
again through a coup d’etat. 
From then on, it was on between 
him and Castro, who belonged to 
the party that had been running
against Batista’s when he took 
power by force in 1952.
When Batista’s army could not 
take on Fidel’s, Batista fled to 
Spain with a fortune of around 
$300 million that he had man­
aged to amass. Ironically enough, 
he died after living peacefully and 
comfortably in Marbella, Spain on 
Aug. 6, 1973 — two days before 
a group of assassins appointed 
by Castro reached him. Perhaps 
it was the same bug of paranoia 
that prompted Batista to flee 
Cuba that sent Fidel after him. 
That is, after all, what a dictator’s 
influence feeds on: paranoia and 
brute force.
Cuba is a nation that, before 
it became frozen in time by the 
reversing power of a totalitarian 
regime, had existed for nearly 
five centuries, and as a republic 
for 57 years. Cuba’s favorable ag­
ricultural industry — primarily 
sugar and tobacco — along with 
the collaboration throughout the 
years between the island’s dif­
ferent sectors and the hard work 
of its society in general had set 
fertile ground for progress in the 
country.
But in Cuba, despotism has 
been a persistent enemy of prog­
ress. The centralization of power 
is so ingrained into the way Cu­
ban society perceives everything 
that it becomes hard for an indi­
vidual to come up with an idea of 
change without the substance to 
even construct the thought.
Power has now been trans­
ferred to Raul Castro, but change 
will still not show its face. The 
Cuban population is still not al­
lowed to collaborate for causes or 
organize in any way. Even if Fidel 
is no longer physically active, the 
idea of him still hangs on all of the 
political proceedings and founda­
tions of the Cuban government. 
President of the Union of Cuban 
Exiles in Puerto Rico Mariluz Su­
arez is not optimistic about Raul’s 
potential to direct Cuba in the 
right direction.
She states, “The personal his­
tory of Raul, who is not a charis­
matic leader, of ruthlessness and
greed, does not herald a bright fu­
ture for the Cuban people. If any­
thing, the changes that Raul has 
claimed worldwide, such as the 
right to own and use a cell phone, 
are nothing more than cosmetic. 
Who can buy and pay for the use 
of cell phone in a place where the 
average salary is equivalent to 
twenty dollars?”
In other words, Raul is perhaps 
just a puppet of this system. He 
operates under the same ideol­
ogy, the only ideology that will 
keep the system alive: careful and 
coldly premeditated manipula­
tion of the masses.
The Obama administration 
has certainly begun taking steps 
toward mending relationships 
with Cuba. For example, shortly 
after taking office, Obama lifted 
restrictions on the possibility of 
individuals visiting relatives in 
Cuba, as well as sending them re­
mittances.
This represents an important 
shift in a U.S. policy that had re­
mained mostly unchanged for as 
long as half a century. However, 
while we like to look optimisti­
cally upon such “advancements,” 
we are forced to remain hesitant, 
since the system has proven stub­
born throughout history — it 
drives us to believe that no real 
change will come until it springs 
from the Cuban government it­
self.
UCE President Suarez seems to 
agree. “There is a worldwide ex­
pectation that with the ‘disappear­
ance’ of Fidel from public view, 
the system that has strangled the 
economy, the liberties, the hopes 
for a better life in Cuba will some­
how change positively. The sys­
tem is firmly established in the 
island, just as it was established 
in Russia for various decades. In 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Re­
publics, after the deaths of Lenin, 
Stalin, Breznev, Kruschev, etc. — 
the iron fist of Communism was 
not abated. So will it not be in 
Cuba, where nothing will change
for the better, since the system 
is entrenched in all the aspects 
of everyday life, and there is no 
liberty of expression, reunion, or 
political views.”
In short, we must view this re­
gime for what it is if we wish to .do 
away with it. The key is definitely 
Cuban society itself. Communism 
will die when Cuba and its people 
are ready to let it disintegrate, 
when they realize there is another 
way, a chance for a better life.
As younger generations come 
of age, communication with the 
outside world will continue in­
creasing and will subsequently 
feed the dreams of the Cubans.
The regime controlling these 
people’s minds and lives will be 
done away with as soon as cir­
cumstance allows them the social 
capacity to shatter the habit of 
fear and blind obedience that is 
keeping them subordinated.

Canadian board’s decision reinforces South African racism
HEATHER TOMKO
Sometimes, going to a school 
like Carnegie Mellon, which I 
believe is at least fairly diverse, I 
forget that racism and discrimi­
nation exist and are practiced 
elsewhere. Especially in times like 
those we’re living in now, where 
we haVe an African-American 
President, it continues to surprise 
me when I read about cases that 
I believe are blatantly discrimina­
tory.
Such is the case of Brandon 
Carl Huntley, a South African 
citizen who was recently granted 
refugee status in Canada after 
claiming persecution in his home 
state.
Huntley claimed that whites 
are targeted by blacks in South 
Africa, and that he himself had 
been targeted seven times in 
cases of attempted robberies and 
muggings. He also claimed that 
the government does nothing to 
protect their white citizens. After 
hearing'his arguments, the Cana­
dian Immigration and Refugee 
Board, which is a tribunal inde­
pendent of the Canadian gov­
ernment, issued their decision to 
grant Huntley the refugee status 
that he asked for.
I find the board’s decision dis­
graceful and appalling on a num­
ber of levels. I admit to having 
very little knowledge of interna­
tional politics, but even I know 
that the racial situation in South 
Africa is one that was already 
volatile before this decision was 
made.
And by granting Huntley refu­
gee status, the board is reinforc­
ing the dichotomy that already 
exists between whites and blacks 
in that country, and also rein­
forcing Huntley’s claim that the 
South African government is not 
doing what is necessary to protect 
its citizens. I can see no positive 
outcomes that will result from the 
board’s decision.
In addition, I feel that the board 
has put too much weight on Hunt­
ley’s claims, and has not done 
enough research into the reality 
of the situation. Maybe if they, 
like me, had watched the Disney 
Channel’s classic movie The Color
of Friendship, they would have a 
different verdict on the matter. 
While I know I probably sound 
slightly ridiculous basing my in­
terpretation of reality on a Disney 
Channel movie, it actually did a 
good job painting a fairly accu­
rate picture of the political hap­
penings of South Africa, which I 
did learn more about later from 
more reputable sources.
But even from the movie alone, 
I learned of the injustices that ex­
isted for blacks in South Africa: 
that while they may have techni­
cally been the racial majority in 
the country, they certainly were 
not treated as such. To imply 
that Huntley, as a white man in 
South Africa, would be targeted 
in a discriminatory manner is ri­
diculous. The movie may have 
been obviously preachy, but it did 
well in delivering its message in a 
way that kids watching the movie 
would understand, and it was a 
message that has since stuck with 
me.
I am also doubtful of the board’s 
basing their decision on Huntley’s 
claims that he was targeted for at­
tempted muggings and robberies. 
As we have lately been reminded,
muggings can happen even in 
places that we believe to be se­
cure, whether it’s an intersection 
that is seconds away from cam­
pus or a suburban neighborhood. 
And while I am certain that South 
Africa does have secure neighbor­
hoods, I am sure they have less 
secure ones as well. And mug­
gings and robberies will occur, no 
matter your race, political party, 
or what country you live in or hail 
from. I do not believe that being 
the victim of a mugging is cause 
to be granted refugee status in an­
other country.
And Huntley’s claim that the 
government is not doing all that 
it can to protect him and its other 
citizens is one that strikes me as 
doubtful, as well. I feel certain 
that the South African govern­
ment is doing its best to cut down 
on crime in their country against 
all of its citizens. But I think it’s 
safe to assume that blacks and 
whites alike are experiencing 
criminal acts, and if Huntley’s 
claim is to be used as evidence, 
it should be a claim that the gov­
ernment is not protecting all of its 
citizens from crime, not just one 
racial group.
I am certainly saddened that 
Huntley does not feel comfortable 
or safe enough to live in his own 
country, and that he must instead 
plead to live in another, and that 
he believes that his government 
is not doing all that it possibly 
can to protect him, one of its own 
citizens, as a government clearly 
should.
But I am even more saddened 
by what I believe will come of the 
board’s decision. When making 
the ruling, the panel chair of the 
tribunal stated that it was clear 
that Huntley would stand out 
like a “sore thumb” in any part 
of South Africa due to his race, a 
comment that I find racist and un­
fitting to be made by the man who 
holds the position of panel chair.
I can only hope that the reper­
cussions of the board’s decisions 
do not serve to reinforce the al­
ready existing racism in South 
Africa, although I fear that they 
will.
Heather Tomko /h tomko @J is Fo­
rum editor and would gladly watch

board to help them re-think their 
decision.
Leadership
Perspectives
SBP, SBVP help 
educate about 
G20 happenings
Rotimi Abimbola & Adam Klein
In just a few short days, leaders 
of the most prominent countries 
of the world will be gathering in 
Pittsburgh for the G20 Summit. 
With so much at stake on an inter­
national scale, Carnegie Mellon 
students should keep themselves 
updated about the discussions 
and debates that will occur not 
far from the heart of our campus. 
As Student Body Vice President 
and President, Adam and I will 
do all that we can to provide in­
formation to the student body, 
both from the administration and 
through various student groups 
and organizations in regard to 
specific issues discussed by G20 
world leaders.
Our primary event for promot­
ing awareness for the summit will 
take place this Friday, Sept. 18 
from 4-8 p.m. at the Fence/CFA 
Lawn, with the rain location in 
the UC Kirr and Wean Commons. 
Dubbed “The G-20 Awareness 
Fair,” this event will be co-spon- 
sored by Student Government 
and AB Special Events. We are 
working with various multicultur­
al, political, and service Student 
Organizations to put together a 
really awesome event that will 
provide information about what 
the G20 is and will allow for in­
teractive sessions where students 
wishing to take a more active 
role within the Awareness Fair 
may voice opinions and promote 
specific concerns with many stu­
dent leaders and organizations. It 
is also an opportunity for you to 
come and learn more about what 
will be happening in Pittsburgh 
around the G20 and how you can 
get to these events. As an addi­
tional perk for all those who at­
tend, food will be provided!
It is unlikely that such an amaz­
ing opportunity for Carnegie Mel­
lon students to gain a greater 
understanding of international 
current events will occur again 
during the rest of our time here 
at Carnegie Mellon. We ask that 
each student take at least a few 
minutes out of their Friday eve­
ning to come to the G-20 Aware­
ness Fair to collaborate with the 
many student organizations that 
will be there and learn about var­
ious issues in our international 
society. These issues are the prob­
lems and discussions that we will 
have to encounter and solve with­
in our lifetimes, and it is impor­
tant to acquire as much informa­
tion as possible so we may make a 
difference when the time comes. 
As Carnegie Mellon students and 
pioneers in education, we can do 
no less.
As always, feel free to contact 
me at rabimbol@ or Adam at agk- 
lein@ if you have any questions or 
concerns. Check out the student 
government website at stugov. 
andrew.cmu.edu for updates on 
our initiatives, and meet us at our 
weekly office hours every Friday 
at noon, either at the UC black 
chairs or by the Fence.
The semester is now in full swing, and memories of a relaxing summer vacation are fading. So we asked,

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Fantasy football is why Ilove the U.S. A
Nadir Sidi
This year I was asked to join 
my friend’s long-running fan­
tasy football league — one of 
the highest honors within the 
male social circle. I grew up in 
Vermont, well within Patriots 
Country (hold on Yinzers, let 
me finish), but I have never been 
an avid football fan. However, 
since becoming an American 
citizen, I have drunk the Kool- 
Aid, or rather the Bud Light, and 
learned to tailgate with the best 
(read: “We are Penn State!”).
So, I fired up my computer and 
started reading every fantasy 
ranking list and blog I could.
Once I officially registered 
my team, the Steel Sidi Champs, 
I asked whoever would listen 
for fantasy pointers. You have 
to pay attention to bye weeks 
(each team has a week off);
past performance is not neces­
sarily a good indicator for fan­
tasy points; look for the sleeper 
picks, which is a term for under­
rated players; and don’t worry 
about drafting a kicker till the 
last round. Like anything im­
possible to master, everybody 
has different views and tips 
when it comes to fantasy sports. 
I took each with a grain of salt 
and in the end decided that no­
body really had an upper hand 
or dominant strategy. During 
the first couple of rounds you 
take whatever ringers you can 
get. After that, it becomes very 
difficult to distinguish the 40th- 
ranked player from the 50th.
Adrian Peterson, Aaron Rod­
gers, Ray Rice, and the Titans’ 
defense sans Albert Haynes- 
worth: these are my fantasy 
ringers. In the comfort of my fa­
vorite armchair with a beer and 
some pepperoni pizza, I marked
my first fantasy football draft. 
I was lucky enough to have the 
second overall pick and was 
even luckier that the first pick 
chose Tom Brady. We made his­
tory amid the egregious trash 
talk from my buddy’s younger 
brother. On any given Tuesday, 
teams are born and champions 
are made.
For the first time ever, I am 
very excited for football season 
and I can’t wait to see how my 
team will fare 17 weeks from 
now. The quantitative side of 
fantasy football really hit home 
with my technical background, 
and I’ve already started my 
spreadsheet for next season. A 
month ago, I couldn’t have told 
you who any of these players 
were, but now, as I ride the bus 
and listen to ESPN’s Fantasy Fo­
cus Podcast, I am proud to say 
that I love football and I love 
America.

The opening week for volley­
ball proved to be a full one for the 
Tartans, who dropped their open­
ing match to Marietta College 3-1 
on their home court, but rallied 
quickly to offer up a decent 2-2 
showing at the Battlefield Clas­
sic, hosted by local ‘Gettysburg 
College. They continued their 
momentum and took the Ober- 
lin College Invitational by force, 
emerging victorious both days, 
winning 3-2 on Friday against 
Notre Dame College, followed by 
3-2 and 3-0 victories on Saturday 
against Manchester College and 
Oberlin College, respectively. The 
Tartans now stand at 5-3 overall 
for the season.
Home court advantage did not 
prove to be helpful in the first 
game of the season against Mari­
etta, where the Tartans took the 
first set 25-15, but found them­
selves overpowered the rest of 
the match, losing the next three 
16-25,17-25, and finally 20-25.
Four days later, the Tartans 
geared up again to participate in 
the Battlefield Classic in Gettys­
burg, Pa. They got off to a good 
start, putting away Gallaudet Uni­
versity 26-24,25-13,25-9 and St. 
John Fisher College 25-18,25-16, 
25-16. However, the Tartans 
dropped the next two matches 
against $alisbury College 0-3 and 
Gettysbtprg 1-3. Senior Samantha 
Carter was very productive, end­
ing the weekend being named to 
the All-Tournament Team with 103 
assists and 34 digs. Junior Caroline 
Size also shined for the Tartans

The Carnegie Mellon men’s and 
women’s cross country teams got 
off to a great start this season, 
competing at the Duquesne Duals 
Sept. 5 and the Wayesburg Invi­
tational Sept. 12. The teams per­
formed well at Duquesne, with 
the women beating five of seven 
teams and the men beating two 
of three. Both teams placed first 
overall at Waynesburg.
At Duquesne, the men’s team 
defeated Niagara University and 
St. Bonaventure University, and 
nearly defeated St. Vincent Col­
lege, falling by merely one point. 
Junior Nate Bussiere was the fast­
est Tartan, finishing 10th overall 
in a time of 26:20, followed by 
senior Josh Finkle, who placed 
48th with a time of 27:59. First- 
year Ben Finch and Marc McGeary 
finished 54th and 56th, respec­
tively.
with 19 total kills, while junior 
Cameron Griffin contributed 18 
digs and six aces.
A week later, the Tartans trav­
eled to Oberlin, Ohio, for the 
Oberlin Invitational and wowed 
fans with an exciting five-set vic­
tory against Notre Dame College. 
After dropping the first set 24-26, 
the Tartans battled back to claim 
the next two, winning both by 
a score of 25-23. The Blue and 
White fought back to snatch the 
fourth set 18-25 to force a tie­
breaker. The Tartans stepped up 
their game and finished off their 
opponents 15-8. Juniors Aislinn 
McCloskey and sophomore Mad- 
die Rosnick each had 12 kills, 
while senior Jessica Brackinand, 
McCloskey, and Size led in blocks,
On the women’s side, the Tar­
tans defeated five teams, includ­
ing Division I local rival Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh. They also 
defeated Niagara, Juniata Col­
lege, St. Bonaventure, and Wheel­
ing Jesuit University. First-year 
Emily Wobb crossed first for the 
Tartans with a time of 19:08 to 
finish fifth overall, while junior 
Courtney Baker placed ninth with 
a time of 19:20. First-year Jack­
ie Altshuler and junior Danielle 
Morse came in 26th and 29th 
overall, respectively. Sophomore 
Danielle Montanaro finished 36th 
overall, while junior Laura McKee 
came in 39th.
The Tartans ran roughshod over 
their opponents at the Waynes­
burg Invitational, as the men 
swept the top five places and the 
women swept the top six, leading 
to a victory for both. First-year 
Emily Wobb led the women with 
a winning time of 23:39, direct-
with eight for Brackinand and 
seven each for the other two.
Still feeling adrenaline from 
their exciting victory, the Tartans 
took care of business Saturday by 
shutting down Oberlin 3-2 and 
Manchester 3-0 to take the tro­
phy. Against Manchester, the Tar­
tans rolled easily through three 
sets to take the win 25-17, 25-16, 
25-22. McCloskey led the team in 
kills with 16, followed by senior 
Jess Brackin with 11. Senior Sam 
Carter put in 75 total assists, 
while Size contributed eight kills 
each game.
Competition resumes next 
Tuesday in Latrobe, Pa. against St. 
Vincent College, and on the week­
end when the Tartans play host to 
the Carnegie Mellon Crossover.
ly followed by first-year Jackie 
Altshuler (24:20) affid junior 
Danielle Morse (25:01). Sopho­
more Cassie Wallace finished in 
25:17 to take fourth, junior Laura 
McKee finished fifth in 25:20, 
and sophomore Danielle Montan­
aro rounded out the sweep one 
second later in 25:21.
For the men, junior J.P. Allera 
won the race in 26:06, followed 
by sophomore Matt Jacob and 
senior Dario Donatelli, who fin­
ished second and third, respec­
tively, with times of 26:14 and 
26:17. Junior Nate Bussiere 
crossed in 26:56, good enough 
for fourth place, and senior Chris 
Rizzo placed fifth place with a 
time of 27:13 to complete the 
dominance.
“The freshmen did well in both 
races and the upperclassmen are 
in good shape going into the heart 
of the season,” said Rizzo.
Both teams will compete next 
at Dickinson College on Sept. 19.
to make it 4-1. The game was also 
the first game back from injury 
for senior forward Pat Lutz. Lutz 
had a terrific game as he consis­
tently put pressure on a nervous 
Westminister back line and he 
ended the game with two assists.
Hosting the Radisson Invita­
tional this past weekend, the Tar­
tans started things off with an 
upset victory against number 18 
Johns Hopkins on Friday. Lutz 
got the Tartans on the score sheet 
with a fantastic header from out­
side of the box. The next day, 
the Tartans easily defeated Penn

When the name Carnegie 
Mellon University is mentioned, 
the first thing people think of 
isn’t usually sports teams or 
dedicated student athletes. The 
truth is, at the end of the year, 
there won’t be too many Tartans 
in the NFL or NBA draft or com­
peting at the Olympics. So, you 
may ask, what’s the point? Stu­
dent athletes at Carnegie Mel­
lon have a particularly demand­
ing daily schedule. Not only do 
they have the countless hours of 
studying typical for a Carnegie 
Mellon student, but they have 
two-plus hours of practice ev­
ery day, extra weight training 
and conditioning at least twice 
a week, and weekend trips or 
early Saturday morning alarms 
that cut into their social lives. 
They are stressed to the limit, 
putting their bodies at risk for 
injury and illness. If profes­
sional sports are not even an op­
tion, why risk it?
Coach Andy Girard recruited 
me to play tennis at Carnegie 
Mellon. We started optional 
practice during orientation 
week, playing several hours 
a day. Season started and we 
traveled to a few matches here 
and there, and I thought this 
wouldn’t be too bad. The winter 
season came and we practiced 
indoors from 9-11 p.m., sacri­
ficing crucial study hours. That 
was just the winter. During our 
hectic spring, we practiced two 
hours a day, and sometimes 
for conditioning we ran after­
ward. We traveled to matches 
just about every other weekend, 
and even had to miss Carnival. 
As the season came to a close 
the weekend between finals, 
after a 5-3 loss to Washington 
and Lee on our home courts to 
qualify for nationals, I sat in 
a circle with my teammates.
State-Altoona, 6-0. After going 
up by four in the first half on 
goals scored by Griffin (two), 
Lutz, and Browne, the Tartans 
put in their reserves, made up 
mostly of their younger players. 
The reserves played beautiful 
soccer in the second half as fan 
favorite Kevin Pierce and Brad 
Edelman got their first goals of 
the season. A lot of credit should 
also be given to the Carnegie Mel­
lon back line and senior goalie 
Maks Khurgin as the defense col­
lected their fourth shutout win of 
the season.
Amid the success of the soccer 
team, a very exciting story has
As I sat there, looking around 
campus, tired as could be from 
pulling several all-nighters to 
finish my studying, I realized 
for the first time in my tennis 
career that I had never once 
throughout the year questioned 
why I was a student athlete. The 
friendships I developed with 
those girls around me, and the 
pride and passion we had repre­
senting our school on the tennis 
courts heavily outweighed the 
work we put in throughout the 
year. Memories of the trips we 
took spun through my mind; 
our week-long spring break 
trip in California, the weekend 
away from Carnival, and the 
various other social occasions 
we missed stood out as exciting 
bonding times with my team, 
not as things I missed because 
of tennis.
During the summer after my 
first year, I developed an injury 
to my right shoulder. My range 
of motion was slightly limited, 
and my strength weakened. I 
was severely disappointed, and 
couldn’t imagine not being a 
part of the tennis team. When 
the doctor told me it was my de­
cision whether or not to play be­
cause my shoulder wouldn’t get 
much worse, I was all for it. I told 
my coach I could only participate 
in doubles because it demanded 
less of my shoulder than play­
ing singles, and he trusted me 
to tell him when I had enough. 
The excitement of the success­
ful season and the endless en­
couragement from teammates 
to succeed on and off the court 
was enough for me to make it 
through the end of the year. 
But when I saw the doctor this 
past summer, he wasn’t so sure 
I had made the right decision. 
Though I had been able to stay 
on the court before, he wasn’t so 
sure I would ever get to experi­
ence that again. I underwent an 
experimental procedure to help 
fix my shoulder, and to my luck
been developing off the pitch as 
a group of first-years created an 
unofficial “football [soccer] sup­
porters group” called “the Tartan 
Army.” The “Army” has come out 
to every home soccer game and 
has made sure to sing their voices 
out. Currently, their numbers are 
small, but they are recruiting very 
heavily. Membership is free and 
the only requirement is to wear 
red or maroon to the games and 
to sing and chant enthusiasti­
cally.
The Tartans’ next match will 
be away against the Gators of 
Allegheny College this Saturday, 
Sept. 19.
and the doctor’s astonishment, 
it worked. After some therapy, 
and a little bit of pain, I am back 
on the tennis court participat­
ing with my team.
However, not all people are 
quite so lucky. Sometimes, pas­
sion for the sport and for the 
team just isn’t enough to keep 
student athletes on the field. 
Luckily, Carnegie Mellon has 
excellent athlete support. Each 
team meets with a nutritionist 
who understands the demands 
of their sport. Specific dietary 
guidelines are explained to stu­
dent athletes in hopes of filling 
their bodies with the proper 
nutrients needed to keep their 
bones and muscles healthy un­
der rigorous demands. A sports 
psychologist also meets with 
the teams. He discusses how to 
cope with the demands of be­
ing a student athlete and how 
to develop time-management 
skills and other strategies to be 
the best on the field and in the 
classroom. Strength and con­
ditioning coach Kevin Schultz 
has also dedicated time to sur­
veying student athletes about 
which muscle groups they feel 
are most prone to injury. He de­
velops a special workout includ­
ing agility exercises and weight 
training techniques to develop, 
strengthen, and rehabilitate 
these muscle groups for each 
team.
The demands of a student 
athlete are incredible, but the 
Athletics Department is doing 
its best to offer the necessary 
programs to allow their student 
athletes to feel that passion and 
excitement on the field while 
still having the energy and 
time to perform in the class­
room. Perhaps that’s why Car­
negie Mellon athletic teams are 
comprised of UAA Champions, 
National Champions, and All- 
Americans while still as a whole 
maintaining a higher GPA than 
the general student body.

schedule.
Haselhoff decided to make 
the switch to Carnegie Mel­
lon to pursue a degree in me­
chanical engineering, while 
also minoring in biomedical 
engineering. While at first he 
had planned on being a profes­
sor of mathematics, Haselhoff 
craved a more concrete field 
of study and followed in his 
father’s footsteps to become 
an engineer. There may have 
been courses that proved to 
be incredibly challenging, but 
Haselhoff is pleased with his 
decision and excels in academ­
ics in a similar way to his per­
formance in soccer.
True to Pittsburgh native 
fashion, Haselhoff is a big 
Steelers football fan. In fact, 
the song Renegade by Styx, 
a regular crowd favorite dur­
ing the games at Heinz Field, 
makes an appearance on the 
Tartans warm-up mix before 
games and is Haselhoff’s fa­
vorite from the playlist. While 
there may not be many other 
pregame rituals or supersti­
tions that Haselhoff follows, 
his goals for the rest of the sea­
son are strong and steadfast. As 
Haselhoff puts it, “My personal 
goal for the rest of the season 
is to do whatever I have to do 
to help our team win. Some 
team goals we are all working 
hard towards are a UAA Cham­
pionship and a long run in the 
NCAA playoffs. Anything less 
would be a major letdown.” % 
The coaching staff, families, * 
and fans hope that the Tartans 
can do just that.

After a very strong preseason, 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer 
team made sure to maintain their 
great form in the first two weeks 
of the season. After six games, 
the Tartan men have beaten a 
nationally ranked team, won an 
invitational, and are now 5-1.
In their first game of the sea­
son, the Tartans took on Wash­
ington and Jefferson College on 
the road, defeating them three 
goals to none. Goals were scored 
by seniors Ryan Heuler (two) and 
Ryan Browne (one). Three days 
later, the Tartans took on one of 
their most challenging opponents 
of the entire season, number 6 
Ohio Wesleyan, in Ohio Wesley- 
an’s Fred Myers Invitational tour­
nament. Although the Carnegie 
Mellon men were outplayed, the 
score line definitely did not tell 
the story. Both teams came out
strong, but Ohio Wesleyan got 
the crucial first goal. Frustration 
continued to mount as Ohio Wes­
leyan got a second goal and then 
a quick third off a questionable 
penalty call in what ended up 
being a 4-0 Bishops’ victory. The 
next day, however, the Tartans 
came out and won comfortably 
against Rutgers-Camden 2-0. 
Ricky Griffin and Brett Roller got 
their first goals of the season.
The momentum carried over 
into the second week of the sea­
son when the boys won all of 
their-next three games. In their 
home opener, the Tartans rat­
tled Westminister College 4-1. 
Goals came flooding in early as 
Keith Haselhoff scored just 43 
seconds after kickoff. The Titans 
then answered back four minutes 
later. First-year John Crawshaw 
then scored a wonderful goal 
off a cross from Ricky Griffin in 
the 10th minute. Jon Simon and 
Ryan Browne put away two more

The Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis team has 
begun the fall season with a bang, winning 
Allegheny College’s Heath Invitational this 
past Saturday. In their opening match, the 
Tartans swept Allegheny 9-0, before defeat­
ing a tough Case Western team 8-1 to win the 
invitational. The Tartans now have a record of 
2-0 to start the year.
All three doubles victories came easily for 
the Tartans against Allegheny, with the first 
doubles team of first-year Duke Miller and 
junior Bobby MacTaggart dropping only two 
games to win 8-2. Seniors Niko Ljuboja and 
James Muliawan played the second doubles 
spot, and outplayed their opponents 8-6. 
Bringing in the third win was first-year Civan 
Orhan and sophomore Jeremy King, who also 
won 8-2.
After the doubles matches, the Tartans lost 
no time getting down to business and putting 
away all six singles. At first singles, for the first 
time in his tennis career, Jon Spero led fhe
Tartans with an easy 6-4, 6-2 victory.
About the overall match, Spero said, “The 
freshmen did well. Some of them struggled 
early, but most of them got into a good groove 
after a few games and pulled out their match­
es pretty easily. I had my college debut at 
number 1 singles and I was very excited. I 
played a guy who I trained with before college 
and it was a good win for me.”
He added jokingly, “Our number 1 doubles 
team looked really good, and freshmen phe- 
nom Duke Miller carried Bobby the whole 
time.”
At second singles, first-year Harsha Rao 
fought to victory, dropping the first set 2-6, 
but rebounded to take the next set 7-5 and 
the tiebreaker 10-0. Miller took third singles
6-4,6-1, followed by first-year Jooho Yu, who 
swept his opponent 6-0, 6-0. Rounding out 
the last two spots were Orhan and first-year 
Neil Soni, who won 6-4, 6-1 and 6-2, 6-3 
respectively.
Against Case, the Tartans had a tougher 
time but swept singles and took two of the 
doubles. Again at first doubles, the team of

Women’s soccer fights through rough week
JONAS ALTMAN-KUROSAKI
Acting Sports Co-editor
The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
soccer team is off to somewhat of 
a rocky start this season, losing 
their season opener at home and 
playing to a 1-3 record through 
their first four games. The Tar­
tans fell 1-0 against Denison Uni­
versity on Sept. 1, followed by a 
3-0 win over Oberlin Sept. 4, a
5-4 loss to Centenary College, 
and a 2-0 defeat at the hands of 
Johns Hopkins University.
Opening the season at home, 
the Tartans played well against 
Denison in a game in which the 
winning — and only — goal 
wasn’t scored until the 75th min­
ute. First-year keeper Becca Gold 
performed well, saving three 
shots while allowing just the one 
goal, scored by Denison’s Kim 
Oshita.
The Tartans managed to pull 
off four shots, including two shots 
on goal, but couldn’t beat the 
clock in the well-played game. 
Their best chances both came in
the second half, when sophomore 
Elsa Wu managed to take two 
shots, with one shot on goal in the 
48th minute, and first-year Katie 
Davis kicked a shot on goal in the 
55th minute, but both attempts 
were rendered fruitless by Deni­
son keeper Courtney Cobb.
Against Oberlin, the Tartans 
had control of the ball most of 
the game en route to their 3-0 
win. In the first half, senior Casey 
Garth and sophomore Carmen 
Easterwood each had two shots, 
while sophomore Nicole Bayley 
and junior Adrienne Pajer each 
took one. Pajer’s shot nearly went 
in as she took Bayley’s rebound 
and directed it at the goal, but the 
shot was blocked.
The Tartans scored all three 
goals in the second half, start­
ing when Katie Davis scored in 
the 56th minute off a pass from 
Wu for her first career goal. Wu 
scored herself four minutes later 
after junior Caroline Danka’s 
shot was blocked, but not held, 
by Oberlin keeper Christie Zel- 
nik. Junior Emily Overstreet also
scored, in the 79th minute, off 
a pass from Bayley. The Tartans’ 
defense was stalwart, not allow­
ing Oberlin to take any shots the 
entire game.
The uplifting win, however, 
was followed by a tough loss on 
Friday at the hands of Centenary. 
The back-and-forth affair started 
with the Lady Cyclones scoring 
in the 12th minute. Roughly a 
minute later, Tartans sophomore 
Korinne Mills tied the score with 
her first career goal, knocking 
in the rebound off a corner kick. 
Centenary’s Jazmine Farrell, 
however, quickly took back the 
lead with her second goal of the 
game in the 21st minute. Her goal 
held up until one second before 
halftime, when Carnegie Mellon 
first-year Lissie Arndt kicked the 
ball over the keeper’s head to tie 
the score at 2.
Once again, though, Farrell 
took the momentum back with 
her third goal of the game in 
the 59th minute, and her goal 
was quickly followed by another 
Centenary score to make it 4-2.
The Tartans once again fought 
back by scoring two quick goals 
of their own, with sophomore 
Ava Murphey putting in Garth’s 
rebound in the 64th minute and 
Overstreet kicking one in from 20 
yards back a minute later. Unfor­
tunately, two and a half minutes 
later, Centenary scored their fifth 
goal to put the game away and 
end the see-saw scoring.
Finally, on Saturday, the Tar­
tans played their fourth match 
of the season against Hopkins. 
The game was somewhat remi­
niscent of the Tartans’ gaihe 
against Oberlin, as the first goal 
was not scored until 42:52 into 
the game, when the Blue Jays’ 
Ava Scheininger headed the ball 
past the Tartans’ keeper, junior 
Anya Rosen. Hopkins then scored 
again in the 51st minute to secure 
the 2-0 win. Aside from the two 
goals allowed, Rosen played a 
solid goalie, saving seven shots.
The women’s soccer team will 
next play Sept. 19 against number 
25 Otterbein College in Wester­
ville, Ohio.
After transferring to Car­
negie Mellon from Duquesne 
University two years ago, se­
nior Keith Haselhoff has had a 
strong showing on the soccer 
field while playing center mid­
fielder for the Tartans. Hasel­
hoff has consistently delivered 
with assists and a few goals of 
his own, and this season he is 
following that same trend. Just 
this past weekend during the 
Radisson Invitational, Hasel­
hoff was instrumental in deliv­
ering assists to his teammates 
to secure the squad’s 2-0 re­
cord for the tournament.
Growing up in White Oak, 
Pa., Haselhoff was encouraged 
to try a variety of sports, from 
baseball and basketball to 
swimming and hockey, on top 
of playing the prevailing soc- 
v cer. Instigated and inspired by 
vhis brother and their competi­
tive athletic nature, Haselhoff 
honed his soccer skills playing 
one on one in the backyard of 
his home.
Haselhoff has maintained 
his family-oriented back­
ground, satisfied with his deci­
sion to stay close to home while 
attending college. Haselhoff is 
able to reap the benefits of go­
ing home for Sunday dinners 
and being around to watch his 
younger sister grow up and de­
velop her own soccer career, 
all of which helps to provide 
Haselhoff with a comfortable 
balance between the stresses 
of a busy school and soccer
Miller and MacTaggart added an 8-4 win 
to go along with the duo of Ljuboja and 
Muliawan, who won in a close 9-7 victory.
For the singles lineup, coach Andy Girard 
decided to mix things up. At the first spot,
MacTaggart fought a tough opponent but 
managed to come up on top, winning 7-6 
(7-4), 6-3. Muliawan added a win, shutting 
down his opponent 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, followed 
by Rao, who had a bit of trouble but won
6-1, 4-6, 10-3. Spero easily won his match 
at fourth singles, 6-2, 6-3, while Miller and 
King each added their wins to the total.
“I think the freshmen performed at a level 
not indicative of true freshmen. They played 
as though they were upperclassmen, which 
I was pleasantly surprised to see,” observed 
assistant coach Mike Belmonte. “The men’s 
team will be improved from last year and 
we will look to make another run at NCAA 
regionals.”
The Tartans have a short three-week break 
before they travel to Virginia to participate 
in the ITA Regional Championship hosted by 
Mary Washington. ‘ Ljuobja and Muliawan closf; the net during a mat; h.

Career Centeradvises studentson job outlook
DOUGLAS MCINTYRE
Copy Manager
Since September 2008, the 
American workforce has seen 
hundreds of thousands of jobs 
lost every month, totaling 6.7 
million since the recession began 
in December 2007.
Though The Washington Post's 
The Ticker reports that August’s 
drop was the lowest since last 
September, 298,000 is still a 
daunting figure for those just en­
tering the workforce.
Carnegie Mellon’s Career and 
Professional Development Cen­
ter encourages students to work 
hard to overcome the Labor De­
partment’s estimated 9.5 percent 
unemployment rate.
“Students have to be actively 
engaged in their job search and 
working hard at it,” said Renée 
Starek, career consultant for the 
Mellon College of Science.
“Employers are no longer in a 
panic,” said Ian C. Shepherdson, 
chief domestic economist for High 
Frequency Economics, as quoted 
in The New York Times. “What we 
don’t see yet is enough momen­
tum in the economy to convince 
companies to hire again.”
The Career Center’s newly in­
stalled director, Robert Murphy, 
hopes to do just that.
“Our core [of regular recruit­
ers] is shrinking because the 
economy is shrinking,” he said, 
“but we’re reaching out to emerg­
ing companies in other seg­
ments.”
Murphy said that there has 
been a 25 perceni decrease in 
college recruitment. This does 
not mean that there are 25 per­
cent fewer companies recruiting 
— Murphy said that the National 
Association of College Employers 
places that figure at about 7 per­
cent — but that there are fewer 
positions they are recruiting for.
“If Microsoft used to be re­
cruiting for 10 positions,” Mur­
phy said, “now they might only 
be looking for seven.”
Murphy also said that they sur­
veyed a large number of poten-
tial employers, and rather than 
hearing a lot of them say they 
weren’t planning to come to cam­
pus, companies were saying they 
could not make a decision yet.
“We’re seeing a wonderful in­
flux of great employers coming 
here,” he said.
Students looking for full-time 
positions, however, might come 
up disappointed.
While Starek said that a lot 
of companies were saying they 
would definitely have intern­
ships, “full-time hires are up in 
the air.”
One problem with full-time po­
sitions is that as the baby boomer 
generation approaches the age •« 
of retirement, fewer people are 
willing to part with long-held po- - 
sitions.
U.S. News and World Report
stated thaf* in the first year of the
recession, retirement accounts 
lost more than $1.6 trillion. With­
out their expected retirement, ' : I 
companies have fewer positions ; 
open for recruitment.
The Career Center is working 
with employers to maximize re- • ; 
cruitment for Carnegie Mellon 
students.
“There could be a large cor­
poration who would be recruit­
ing just physics majors,” Murphy * < » 
said. “That corporation has other * 
departments. We are encourag­
ing them to hire from other dis­
ciplines.”
Murphy said that the Career 
Center is also targeting employ­
ers to satisfy the students’ needs. 
Such career consultants as Starek 
can focus on specific kinds of jobs 
for the students in the colleges 
with which they are associated.
Starek is hopeful about recruit­
ment in the upcoming months.
“There are still jobs out there to 
be had,” she said. “There is going 
to be change in the next couple of 
months.”
Starek said that by the spring 
semester, Carnegie Mellon could 
be seeing a lot more employers 
coming to recruit as positions be­
gin to open up.

Gallery turns sour things sweet
When life gives you lemons, buy some miracle fruit
Everything you need to know
About lending a shoulder and waiting for birthdays
Junior electrical and computer engineering 
major Manasi Patil sucked delightedly on a 
lemon quarter. “This tastes just like lemonade!" 
she exclaimed. While it might sound strange 
that Patil felt she was drinking sweet lemonade 
straight from a sour lemon, she wasn’t imagining 
it in any way. She was, in fact, experiencing the 
effect of a marvelous creation called the miracle 
fruit tablet.
A freeze-dried form of a wondrous African berry 
called miracle fruit, this tablet, like the berry, 
has the ability to change the way the consumer 
^tastes sour things and makes them taste sweet.
It blocks the taste receptors in the tongue that 
taste sourness with a substance called miraculin, 
which allows sour things like citrus to be 
perceived as sweet. The effects can last from 
15 minutes to an hour and can be eliminated by 
drinking some tea or hot water.
Last Friday, the Miller Gallery hosted a Taste 
Odyssey Reception, intended to provide a taste- 
tripping experience to the first 150 visitors by 
rewiring their taste buds with a miracle fruit 
tablet and presenting them with a plethora of 
sour foods to sample. Spread across two tables 
were glasses of sour lemon quarters, bowls of 
bright pink vinegar punch with yellow lemon 
slices, pale-green vinegar bubble tea, a plate of 
colorful sour gummy worms, boiled vegetables 
like radish and carrot, tiny cups of hot Tabasco 
pepper sauce, bowls of salty, vinegary potato 
chips, and pickled cabbage.
Patil sucked delightedly on 
a lemon quarter. This tastes 
just like lemonade!’
Visitors who wished to experiment — not all 
were very willing — were handed a tablet and 
instructed to let it dissolve gradually in their 
mouths. Once the tablet was all gone, the 
experimenting could begin.
Under the influence of the tablet, the sour 
gummy worms and potato chips, were deliciously 
sweet, the vinegar punch milder than its 
usual self, the vinegar bubble tea milky, and, 
as mentioned before, the lemons tasted like 
lemonade. The effect on the Tabasco sauce was 
not very impressive, and the sauce retained its 
original fiery taste.
Kristen Severson | Photo Editor
Miracle fruit tablets make sour lemons taste like 
sweet oranges.
Dear Rohit,
I have this really good friend of 
mine who’s just gone through 
a breakup. Unfortunately, she 
seems really caught up in it and 
it’s become the only thing we 
talk about these days. It’s come 
to a point that I just want to say 
“STFU,” but I know I shouldn’t 
because I really value our 
friendship and want to be there 
for her when she needs me as 
a friend. How can I forcefully 
say that while I feel her pain, I 
don’t ttiink she’s benefiting from 
dwelling on it? She’s definitely 
the type of person who dwells 
on things rather than moving 
on. How can I tell her to stop 
thinking about it and return back 
to her normal friendly self?
What was most exciting and confusing about the 
experience was the conflict between the senses 
of smell and taste. While drinking the vinegar 
punch, one could still smell the acidic odor of 
vinegar, but its taste completely contradicted 
what was expected. Also, it still caused a 
burning sensation in the throat, and Miller 
Gallery staff members advised against drinking 
too much of it, no matter how harmless it tasted, 
since it still had the same effect on one’s body.
These miracle fruit tablets are used for more than 
just recreation and do have a very useful purpose. 
They are given in unlimited supply to some 
of the most unlikely people — chemotherapy 
patients. Some of these patients, who have lost 
most of their sense of taste due to the continuous 
exposure to radiation, are using these pills to 
make food more enjoyable. Children who are 
cancer patients are also being administered a 
dose so that their medicine tastes better.
Miracle fruit is a unique manifestation of the 
mysterious ways of nature, and its effects are so 
surprising and delightful that everyone should, 
whether in berry or tablet form, give it a try. The 
tablet can be purchased online and one of the 
popular brands to look out for is Miracle Frooties. 
They sell a pack of 10 large-sized tablets for • 
$14.95.

—Painful Aftermath of Love 
Dear PAL,
That’s a tough tightrope to walk
— you want to be supportive of your 
friend, but after a while you get so 
sick of hearing the same thing over 
and over that you just want to tell 
her to get a grip on her life. You can 
try talking her out of it, but if she is 
the kind of person who dwells on 
things, then that approach just isn’t 
going to work.
In my experience, the best way to 
get out of a situation like this is to 
gently push your friend toward new 
experiences. Try getting her involved 
in activities that will take her mind off 
the breakup. Avoid conversations 
that could lead to a talk about her 
relationship. If she’s complaining 
about something that happened, 
help her figure out something to 
do or say. Make sure you always 
take a hard stance on self-pitying 
statements. If she ever pulls out 
the “I'll be alone forever, nobody will 
ever love me again” card, point out 
to her both the absurd falseness 
of that statement and the feet that 
she’s a beautiful, strong woman 
who doesn’t need a stupid boy. I am 
sure that eventually you will have her 
back as the friend you always liked.
Love is a two-edged sword, 
—Rohit
Dear Rohit,
It’s the fall of my junior year, and 
my friends have started turning 
21. Now, I would be celebrating, 
but my birthday isn’t until May! 
What am I supposed to do for 
the next eight months while 
pretty much everyone I like is 
bar-hopping?
—Sober in Skibo
Dear SIS,
First of all, if you’re going to be sober 
and sad, you shouldn’t do it in Skibo! 
It’s definitely not the most ideal place 
for it. The frozen yogurt might tempt 
you, but it’s best to take that order to 
go. More importantly, did you learn 
nothing from AlcoholEdu? If you 
can’t bear to be around friends that 
are mocking you with their drinking 
binges then get younger friends. 
Just realize that not being 21 is not 
a huge deal.
I am sure that there are other legal 
ways you can have fun. I personally 
recommend getting addicted to a 
TV show — they are really great to 
watch in a group and then discuss 
every single detail about them. You 
can also try and figure something out 
with your friends born after May.
I am sure that you wilt turn 21 in no 
time and be able to enjoy that Long 
Island Iced Tea. You can buy one for 
me, too.
Bide your time,
—Rohit

Tales from abroad: Paris
Taste the flavor of France, from baguettes to lapin to French wine
A friend of mine once told me that the most important 
moments of my life always occur around food, and this last 
summer was no exception. While at the French capital, I rode 
on the Parisian metro, walked my way through Paris, drank 
champagne on top of the Eiffel Tower, and tasted all the meals 
as if they were a dream.
I 'spent my time at École Centrale Paris, a French version 
of the California Institute of Technology, and I didn’t speak 
French then and still don’t speak it now. First of all, the name 
of the institution is misleading. There is nothing central about 
the location of the school, and it is situated in a town called 
Châtenay-Malabry, in the south of Paris.
École Centrale Paris is an engineering school and the alma 
mater of famous engineers, like Gustave Eiffel and Andre 
Michelin. But to the French, engineers are not just highly 
skilled technicians; they are entrepreneurs, managers, and 
much more.
For this reason, the engineering curriculum at Paris includes 
such diverse subjects as philosophy and fine arts. During my 
time there, I took international business classes with other 
American students, and yes, the classes were in English.
There were some downsides to life in Paris, though. For 
example, there were no air conditioners in any of the 
school buildings (aside from a tiny hallway heading to the 
underground computer lab), and, for some reason, the French 
do not use deodorant, making situations uncomfortable for 
obvious reasons.
But what I liked least about French lifestyle was the breakfast. 
On campus, breakfast was served between 7:30 and 8 a.m., 
while our classes began only at 9, and what made it worse 
was how the French enjoy having only bread 
and coffee in the morning.
To be fair, they served —
baguettes and 
occasional
croissants, along with coffee and juice, but these breakfast 
shortcomings were easily overcome by the delicious French 
cuisine.
At the first dinner hosted by the program, the school took 
us to a fancy restaurant. It was a French-Italian place, and 
the meal began with an appetizer of fresh, mild, and soft 
goat cheese sitting on a bed of rough tomato puree. The 
main course was pan-seared chicken on lentil risotto and the 
dessert was a mouth-watering amber apple upside-down pie 
served with coffee ice cream. Our professor asked us if we 
would like to have some wine because, at 20, it is legal for 
me to drink wine in France. Bread, wine, and cheese — what 
more do you need in life?
Wine in Paris is actually quite cheap. For four to six euros, you 
can buy some splendid wine. Once, I walked out of a homage 
store — a French cheese shop — with fragrant bread, non­
industrialized cheeses, and a bottle of red wine for less than
5 euros in total. A French lady taught me that you always 
get red wine with cheese and you should drink it at room 
temperature. I’ve never drunk wine aside from sipping wine 
from my parents’ glass, but now, every time I sniff a glass of 
Cotes du Rhone, the perfume reminds me of my time in Paris.
In France, my life flowed at a different pace. According to 
my schedule, class started at 9 a.m., but I could wake up at
9 and still be in class by 9:20 a.m. without missing anything. 
On the days I had class, the lectures were all three hours 
long, meaning that by four in the afternoon, I would have sat 
through six hours of lecture on the same topic. In this respect, 
I missed Carnegie Mellon. Lunch hours were different, too, 
stretching much longer, as the French are famous for their 
lunches.
I went to a restaurant called L’Ami Jean on the left bank of the 
Seine, and there I spent two hours having a glorious French 
lunch. At this small restaurant owned by the respected 
Stéphane Jégo, the bread on the table was a great sign 
because, from my experience, good bread promises excellent 
food.
I started my meal with caramelized foie gras on a bed of 
seasonal mushroom with seared baguette. This foie gras 
was the best thing I have ever put into my mouth. It was 
not too fatty and was packed with flavor. The generous slab 
was lightly dusted with sugar and torched with fire, and 
the caramelized taste and salty aroma of the foie gras was 
heavenly.
The lady who served me was running around the little place 
trying to serve everyone else, too. Still, she patiently gave me 
a tour of the menu and recommended a sweet white wine to 
go with the foie gras. While I was waiting for my main course, 
a gentleman at the table to my left saw how I was beaming 
while eating my meal and struck up a conversation with me.
I also had a conversation with a Canadian couple on my right 
when they saw me take photos of the food. Good food opens 
people's hearts, bringing them together.
For the main course, I had lapin — French for rabbit — which 
had an intense flavor with various herbs seasoning the meat 
and the sauce. The French man who served me told me to 
“dig in," and I used my hand, feeling the meat and the bone 
with my fingers, and savoring the experience. To finish off 
my meal, I had a delicate vanilla rice pudding, cooked to 
perfection. Every time I think about that meal, my heart beats 
faster, and I am reminded of why I love food as much as I do.
Like French food, the French are complicated, ornate, and 
effortlessly elegant. They don’t streamline, mass-produce, 
or industrialize their cuisine, their life, or their view of the 
world. The respect the French have for food, not just 
French cuisine, is the same kind of respect they 
have for their life. I am, truly, in love with 
Paris.

Indian Ocean makes waves
Classical-rock band brings audience to their feet
The Antonian Theatre at Carlow University attracted a 
large crowd last Saturday night. Fans of an incredible 
and electrifying genre of music, classical-rock fusion, 
were present to see a leading band that has made this 
fusion their trademark — Indian Ocean.
Indian Ocean is a unique band. With songs in over 
30 different languages, their music is about the 
characteristics of a human being and the journey 
through life. The band members: Susmit Sen (lead 
guitar), Asheem Chakravarty (tabla, taiang, vocals), 
Rahul Ram (bass guitar, vocals), and Amit Kilam (drums, 
flute, gabgubi, vocals) are a group of very talented 
individuals who combine their skills to produce some of 
the most inspiring music out there today.
With five highly successful albums released so far and 
having performed in more countries than they can 
remember, including a show at Trafalgar Square in 
London, they truly are a band that is here to stay.
Sitting in the audience, watching them perform songs 
ranging from one about the journey of a bird titled 
"Bhor" to a Syrian prayer hymn titled “Kandisa,” I • 
couldn’t help but notice the trance everyone around 
me was in. People were dancing in the aisles, clapping 
their hands in unison to the beat, and shouting out their 
requests — it was a sight worth watching. Fortunately 
for me, I also got a chance to interview one of the band 
members and co-founders of the band, Sen, and here 
are some excerpts from the interview:
The Tartan: How did you decide on the name "Indian 
Ocean?”
Sen: We went through quite a lot of options, but in the 
end it was my father that gave us the name “Indian 
Ocean” to reflect how we drift between different 
cultures and traditions.
The Tartan: How was the band formed?
Sen: I met Asheem at a concert in 1984 and we began 
doing duo sessions together. In 1990, Rahul joined us 
replacing Anirban (a previous member] on bass. In 
1994, Amit joined us and the band has stayed the same 
ever since then. There was a lot of initial struggle as no 
music label wanted to invest in instrumental music, but
Rahul Ram is a lively presence on 
stage as he awes the audience with 
his performance on the bass guitar. 
Indian Ocean is a pioneer in the 
classical-rock fusion genre.
slowly we found our place in the industry, and here we 
are today.
The Tartan: Your music is of a very different make. 
What are the major influences behind this form of 
music?
Sen: Well, there is no major influence as such. Since 
childhood, we have learned to keep our eyes and ears 
open to what’s happening around us, and it results in 
the way we think about our music. We usually don’t 
write our own lyrics. They are written by Sufi poets or 
other budding writers and we give those lyrics a sound 
that resonates its meaning. So essentially there is no 
major influence as such. If we like what we see, then 
we try and use our creative talents as artists to give it a 
form that can be heard by many others.
The Tartan: What do you do in your spare time?
Sen: All of us quit our jobs way back and made the 
band our sole career. I have a lot of other interests 
besides music. I love painting; I am an ardent 
photographer; I also love cooking and experimenting 
with food. My biggest passion besides the guitar is 
probably wildlife, especially ornithology. I also enjoy 
watching and playing sports, especially cricket and 
soccer.
The Tartan: What are the future plans for the band?
Sen: Currently, we are on a 15-concert tour of the 
United States. You can visit www.indianoceanmusic. 
com to see our schedule. We have composed the 
soundtrack of one Bollywood movie so far, called Black 
Friday, and are in the process of composing music for a 
film called Shoonya.
At the end of the concert, Indian Ocean held a unique 
auction, asking audience members to bid for two songs 
that they wanted the band to play, and successfully 
raised around $1900 for Association for India’s 
Development (AID) Pittsburgh, the charity the concert 
benefited. Go to www.aidindia.org to learn more about 
their work.

mommsflOn the roots of country
The Steelers’ opening night victory brought much celebration in 
Pittsburgh. Since it was also the opening game of the NFL season, 
the spectacle was almost as big as the game, and country star Tim 
McGraw headlined a free concert for Steelers fans before the game. 
With all the talk about “America’s Favorite Sport” — and the debate 
over whether it’s baseball or football — I figured I’d give a little history 
on “America’s Favorite Music.”
According to a radio survey, more than 77 million American adults 
listen to country music on the radio every week. It is undoubtedly 
American, a part of the stereotypical American image here at home 
and overseas, and it has become “as American as apple pie,” despite 
the fact that the dessert has its origins in Europe. So how did it get this 
way? We owe a lot to one man: Ralph Peer.
In 1927, in Bristol, Tenn., Peer set up a recording studio in a barn 
and started running ads in newspapers and flyers looking for artists. 
Some people who had already recorded with or knew of Peer came 
first, then more people came as they began to hear about the kind of 
royalties his artists were getting ($3600 a year). Among the musicians 
who recorded were the famous Carter Family, the “First Family of 
Country,” and Jimmie Rodgers, the “Blue Yodeler.” Both acts found 
huge success, with Rodgers selling over half a million copies of his 
song “T is for Texas.” While so-called “hillbilly” recordings had sold 
fairly well earlier in the decade, these latest recordings were something 
new altogether. Blending secular ballads and gospel music with blues 
and a hint of jazz, along with a few good-time party and comedy 
songs, the music took off. The themes resounded even more during 
the Great Depression, and while most businessmen were out of luck 
and money on Wall Street, Peer continued to make large amounts of 
money simply from royalties.
The legacy of the Bristol recording sessions is beyond measure. 
Besides the debuts of two of the biggest country music stars, they 
gave country a new sound. Where before what was labeled country 
was a mixture of hick tunes and old ballads, the recordings gave old 
folk songs and gospel hymns a cleaner, more refined sound. Country 
became more successful and began to speak to a wider audience. 
This paved the way for stars like Hank Williams and Johnny Cash.
So the next time you listen to any kind of country music, whether old 
or new, you can think back to a little barn in Bristol, Tenn., where it all 
got started.

\Blogs serve up hunger-inducing humor
Five websites to follow featuring unorthodox foods
The Fat Koko is a cheese steak sandwich stuffed with 
french fries and mozzarella sticks. Now, if that doesn’t sound 
mouth-wateringly, arteries-cloggingly filling — how about 
peeled Chicken McNuggets boiled in a paste of their own 
breading and served over pureed fries?
The world of food blogging is full of these bizarre 
combinations and innovative recipes. The best sites do it 
all with a dash of humor and a pinch of salt. Add in a snazzy 
presentation and you get some of the most popular blogs on 
the Internet. v
Dressing up droll foods
On a website garnished with the familiar color pairing of 
yellow on bright red, a warmly-lit picture features a moist 
creme brulee served alongside a strawberry tart. These 
decadent desserts, however, boast a rather humble beginning: 
a box of Dunkin’ Donuts.
Each entry on fancyfastfood.com comes with a recipe 
describing how to transform cheap fast food into more 
extravagant meals. In the case of our erudite sweets, the 
fillings of eight Boston Kreme, a vanilla cream, and three 
strawberry jelly doughnuts are extracted, morphing into 
the creme brulee, tart topping, and tart filling, respectively. 
Meanwhile, the actual pastry gets ground up and mashed 
together to form the tart’s crust.
From McDonald’s to 7-Eleven, the inexpensive offerings of 
many fast food restaurants are featured on this relatively new 
blog. Some entries even embed videos to illustrate how to 
create these radical recipes.
A feast for the eyes
A double bypass burger teeters precariously, weighed 
down by two fried eggs, five slices of bacon, and four slices 
of cheese. Being wedged between two grilled cheese 
sandwiches doesn’t help its foundational stability, either.
Photographs of this and other stomach-turning dishes on 
thisiswhyyouiefat.com practically ooze fat onto your computer 
screen as your eyes bloat from the caloric intake. Each 
hunger-inducing image is accompanied by a tantalizing 
description like “Oreo cream centers removed and melted into 
a dip."
While some of the ideas can nauseate even the most 
adventurous eaters — anyone for a burger topped with 
Easy Cheese inside a jelly doughnut? — the tendency of our 
species to crave fat and sugar is enough to drive this blog to 
popularity for a very long time.
Professional doesn’t always mean quality
Imagine going to a shop to get a personalized cake made.
You have decided that you want the guest of honor to hack 
into his own face, so you provide the bakery with a flash drive
on which you have provided the perfect picture to transfer 
onto,the cake. As you open the box, you are presented with 
a painstaking replica of your flash drive in all its frosted glory. 
This true story is one of many painfully hilarious tales on the 
menu at cakewrecks.com, a blog devoted to bewildering 
blunders of professional cake decorators.
From malformed cartoon characters to misunderstood 
instructions — one gorgeous chocolate cake with a 
chocolate-dipped strawberry on top was marred by the 
inscription “Leave Blank” — Cake Wrecks does not fail to 
amuse and'delight its readers with some of the worst excuses 
for professional products ever to come out of the world of 
cake.

Turkey and cheese sandwiches paired with waffles create a 
gigantic meal that can make a big breakfast or a satisfying 
lunch.
A little taste after dinner
The simple formula espoused in American movies and 
television shows is that if a man takes a woman out to 
dinner, she is obliged to return the favor by providing a 
little “dessert” afterward. This is the creative energy behind 
cooktobang.com.
The recipes might be easier than pie for Julie Powell, but 
they are certainly presentable enough to entertain that fine 
guy or gal you’ve been hoping to coax. The savory "Atkins 
for Trouble Burger Salad” takes only 10 minutes and $8 to 
make and is a perfect protein-rich choice to precede some 
strenuous physical activity.
The simple dinners and quick desserts are designed to give 
the illusion of restaurant-quality food in the hopes of standing 
in for that expensive meal. What makes this blog so well-read, 
however, is that every entry drips with sarcasm and even
6pillbOX 09.14.09
peppers in a few jabs at the reader just for tuning in.
Playing with your food
From the delectably adorable to the certifiably peculiar, 
insanewiches.com offers readers a taste of some very unusual 
sandwiches — if you stretch the definition of sandwich a 
little.
One entry serves up a bread computer mouse with ham for 
buttons, paired with a USB cheese stick. Another gives you a 
sandwich somewhere between breakfast and lunch (though 
the author assures us it’s not brunch): a turkey and cheese 
club served on waffles — four of them — instead of bread.
While this blog doesn’t serve up the same kind of wit as the 
previous two, each entry is unique enough to bring readers 
back for more. After all, who wouldn't want to see the next 
daily special from the site that brought you the ham, salami, 
capaccolo, and pancetta sandwich in a wine glass?
Rule 34, which, according to urbandictionary.com, states that 
“if it exists, there's pom on it,” makes the Internet seem like 
an often frightening place to graze, but don't let that stop 
you from enjoying the sugar and spice of funny food blogs.
If you’re feeling creative, send an entry their way; these 
bloggers are always on the lookout for new ideas to broadcast 
to the world.

Miyazaki’s Ponyo makes a splash
Impressive filmography makes this movie worth a watch
Hayao Miyazaki, the mastermind behind Howl's Moving 
Castle, Spirited Away, and Totoro, has come out with another 
beautiful movie to add to his already impressive filmography.
Ponyo is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen’s 
tale “The Little Mermaid,” but contains a distinctly 
Miyazaki-esque touch. The new "mermaid” is a little goldfish 
named Brunhilda, later renamed Ponyo by the human boy, 
Sousuke, who finds her and takes her to preschool with him. 
Ponyo’s father, a sea wizard, is distraught at his daughter’s 
disappearance and eventually contrives a way to have her 
return. However, Ponyo doesn’t give up that easily. She drinks 
one of her father’s magical potions, starts to grow legs and 
arms, and then uses her newfound powers to free her other 
goldfish sisters to help her find Sousuke.
Ponyo, as is characteristic of Miyazaki’s films, has an 
interesting duality between man and nature. Ponyo’s father, 
it turns out, has forsaken living on land as a human because 
of the way that humans treat the sea, always polluting it and 
wreaking havoc with its ecosystem. He instead turns to the 
ocean as the source of his power and his home. Interestingly, 
the film explores the relationship between magical and 
non-magical worlds. While Ponyo is transformed into a girl,
she is unable to perform magic, but can do it when she 
changes back into a goldfish. At the film’s end, she must 
make the choice of giving up her magic and living on land or 
keeping it and continuing to live under the sea.
Fans of mythologies and fairy tales from around the world will 
delight in the references and roots of magic explored in Ponyo. 
From classical myths to Japanese folklore to the intriguing 
inventions of Miyazaki, Ponyo is a feast of characters and 
enchantment, sure to please viewers looking for a new 
perspective on modern magic.
While Ponyo is entertaining, movie-goers are advised that, at 
heart, it is a children’s film. It does not have the same scope 
as Princess Mononoke or other deeper films of Miyazaki. This 
doesn’t prevent it from being a good film to watch or a fun 
experience, but it does mean that older viewers might find 
themselves wondering why certain things are happening the 
way they are — such as characters’ laughing at silly jokes, or 
the little kids’ being so willing to accept the balance between 
the magical and the mundane.
However, Ponyo allows Miyazaki a chance to exercise some 
of the whimsicality not seen since his celebrated character
Catbus in Totoro. Ponyo’s father moves around in a chariot 
made of squids; he can summon schools of fish with a wave of 
his hand; and in order to survive on land and retain his magic, 
he must keep his feet wet at all times. Ponyo's character also 
celebrates the strangeness of the undersea world, whether by 
her exotic name Brunhilda or by her immediate penchant for 
ham.
Overall, Ponyo is an admirable addition to Miyazaki's films. 
Fans of his work should definitely check the movie out, 
keeping in mind that it’s much more like a Totoro for this 
generation than a film that is meant to ask deep questions.
It can still be thought-provoking, but it does so on a reduced 
scale. Viewers be warned, though: the ending song of Ponyo 
is extremely catchy, if a little too sing-song, and will be stuck 
in your head for days to come.
As an animated film, Ponyo is highly recommended. Given the 
glut of computer animation crowding the children's market 
at the box office these days, Ponyo’s careful, hand-drawn 
animation is a rare treat.

Sunshine Cleaning
Thursday, Sept. 17 
8 10 12
From the producers of the charmingly 
odd Little Miss Sunshine comes 
another off-kilter flick. Sunshine 
Cleaning is a dramedy about two 
sisters who open a crime scene and 
biohazard cleaning business. Amy 
Adams and Emily Blunt shine as 
Norah and Rose Lorkowski, who are 
attempting to raise tuition for Oscar, 
their son and nephew, respectively, 
with their offbeat business venture. 
The movie moves along pleasantly 
during its 91 -minute run time, with a 
very nice mix of sadness and laughter 
spread along the way.
Watchmen
Friday, Sept. 18 
7 10 1
300 director Zack Snyder tried his luck 
with this 20-years-in-the-making flick 
about rogue superheroes who begin 
an investigation into the murder of a 
colleague. The film is based on the 
well-regarded graphic novel of the 
same name written by Alan Moore, 
who also penned the graphic novel V 
for Vendetta. However, when adapting 
a 416-page comic book, you’re going 
to have to leave out a lot of dialogue 
and plot elements, leading many to 
consider Watchmen a jumbled mess 
that tries to do too much. I say screw 
the critics and decide for yourself: the 
visuals alone are reason enough to see 
this movie.

Scarface
Saturday, Sept. 19 
7:30 10 12:30
Al Pacino is Tony Montana. One of the 
most well-known and quoted films of all 
time, Scarface grabs you and refuses 
to let go right from the start. While 
the violence and graphic language 
received much criticism back in 1983, 
it contributed to the large cult following 
Scarface has gained, and today, we eat 
all that stuff up. In this epic crime drama, 
we follow Tony as he rises from Cuban 
refugee to drug kingpin in Florida, with 
all the highs (pun intended) and lows 
along the way graphically represented. 
Kindness, rage, gore, chainsaws, and so 
many other nouns make their presence 
in this magnificent piece of American 
cinema.
Drag Me To Hell
Sunday, Sept. 20 
81012
In cult director Sam Raimi’s much 
awaited return to horror, Drag Me To 
Hell, we get a hellishly outrageous, 
hilarious, and terrifying movie that 
simply delivers what it is meant to 
deliver. As all horror films should be, 
it is rated R and pushes that limit, 
as well as the limits of any normal 
human being, to no end. I guess 
I should say here what the plot is, 
but it is fairly self explanatory: spirits 
torment a girl and will literally drag her 
to Hell unless she rids herself of them 
in three days. I can’t say it enough — 
this is so much more than a brainless 
rip-off or sequel, and it truly is what it 
is: a completely original horror flick.

Glorious food that sates all sugar cravings
Gourmet bakery serves up delicious pies, moist cakes, and sweet tarts
I by Brian WadeJunior Staffwriter
Students at Carnegie Mellon are pretty lucky — nearly every 
conceivable form of food can be found within minutes of 
campus. Bakeries, whether specializing in pastries, pies, 
cupcakes, or all of the above, have become quite popular 
among students looking for a sweet treat and a break from 
their studies. One great option for sampling desserts is 
Food Glorious Food, a catering company that opens their 
shop in Highland Park every Saturday morning to sell their 
fresh-baked creations to the community.
The display at the bakery, with the grand spread of cakes, 
cookies, tarts, pies, and quiches, is guaranteed to make any 
customer’s mouth water, as well as remove the ability to 
choose any particular pastry.
One customer favorite is the Apple Harvest Cake. Loaded 
with large apple chunks, it is a tangy cake that is sure 
to please. Its cream cheese-based frosting maintains the 
moisture and adds a creamy texture. Each bite comes close 
to melting in your mouth. Although it is extremely delicious, 
the richness of the cake makes just one slice extremely 
satisfying.
Another good option is the Jewish Pizza. This breadstick is 
very different from the usual kind, with a firm, crisp, sugar- 
coated exterior. The tastes of dried fruit and almonds come 
through to accent this addicting treat.
The Lemon Tart, with its strong flavor and nice, thick 
consistency, is also a great choice. The filling is glazed over, 
giving it a creme brulee crunch with each bite. The crust is 
firm and maintains the integrity of this dish to complement 
the lemon filling, creating an interesting but successfully 
dynamic bite. Instead of being acidic and sour, it is a nice, 
refreshing tart that has a hint of summer.
The Sour Cream Apple Pie presents a different approach 
to making an apple pie. In between the slices of apple are 
layers of sour cream. It gives balance to the pie, keeping it 
from being too sweet. Above the fluffy apple and sour cream 
combo is a crunchy top layer, giving this pie an unique 
combination of coffee cake and apple pie taste.
There are some exceptions to the great standard of desserts, 
though. The highly recommended Neapolitan cake was 
messy, heavy, and fell significantly short of expectations. 
Large pillows of cream interrupted the layers of pastry. 
Unfortunately, the pastry was not as soft as it should have 
been and the effort it took to eat it ruined the dish.
This charming little bakery is just a side note to the larger 
operation. The owners, Brad Walter and chef Tom Hambor, 
run Food Glorious Food as a cooking school, catering 
company, and corporate training center. They also have a 
small gourmet store located at their bakery. The hands-on 
cooking classes teach everything from making your own 
mozzarella cheese to organic soups and gourmet meals.
Although slightly expensive, these classes teach skills that 
will impress anyone.
Food Glorious Food includes Carnegie Mellon as a 
significant part of its history. Walter was the Dean of Student 
Affairs here at Carnegie Mellon back in the 1980s. He was 
the one who brought the infamous clock to the Cut, as well 
as pushing for the construction of the University Center to 
give students a proper place to meet with each other. He 
eventually went to the Loretta Paganini School of Cooking in 
Cleveland and has since taught cooking around the world. 
He met his business partner in 2000 and opened Food 
Glorious Food shortly after.
Every Saturday, the bakery opens at 10 a.m. and goes until 
they are sold out. Usually this happens around 4 p.m., so 
getting there early is a good idea so that you can sample 
some of their best stuff. Customers can feel the attention to 
detail and quality of the food. Food Glorious Food is a great 
bakery that must be experienced.

Myriad mix-ins, ice cream make delicious dessert
Oh Yeah! is a great place to grab some midnight waffle cones
nights and last until midnight.
“We get a lot of students from Pitt and Carnegie Mellon, and 
a lot of locals as well, who are regulars at the coffee bar. On 
Friday and Saturday night, there is usually a line out the 
door.”
Although Oh Yeah! is in a more affluent neighborhood in 
Shadyside — surrounded by independent antique shops 
and nice restaurants — it is definitely tailored to a younger 
crowd. Oh Yeah! is off the beaten path for students, but, oh 
yeah — definitely worth a taste for breakfast, brunch, lunch, 
or a delicious dessert.
Oh Yeah! is located on S. Highland Ave in Shadyside. Visit 
their website at www.customswirl.com or contact them at 
412.253.0955.
Oh Yeah! provides customer with a wide variety 
of toppings and ice cream flavors that can be 
combined to create a unique dessert.
J.W. Ramp I PublisherJ.W. Ramp I Publisher
to be combined with one of the soy or dairy ice cream flavors 
Oh Yeah! has to offer.
The regular waffle is big enough for two to split, so consider 
a "haffle" for $3. If choosing to cut the amount of batter in 
half, don't skimp on the number of scoops or toppings — 
the reputable (and fantastic) Dave and Andy’s Ice Cream 
of Oakland supplies Oh Yeah! with their tubs of ice cream 
goodness. It really is difficult to go wrong with any ice cream 
flavor or topping — even if one was brazen enough to try the 
squirrel meat flavor.
Squirrel meat aside, this is not your average ice cream 
venue. Oh Yeah! exudes a unique, homemade feel. The 
owner, who goes by the name “Rooster,” built the counter 
and coffee bar from materials he found at Construction 
Junction, and keeps second-hand books and records in 
the back corner for those who want to take their sweet 
time savoring their creation or making use of the free 
wireless Internet. The walls are a gallery of license plates 
and highway signs, and cork boards post announcements 
of upcoming art exhibits in the area. The coffee bar is 
equipped with turquoise ceramic espresso mugs — a 
cheerful accompaniment to your daily dose of caffeine.
Esker warned of the crowds that begin at 8 p.m. on weekend

“It’s really bomb!” said senior fine arts major Robin Schemes, 
as she dug into one of Oh Yeah!’s signature waffle and ice 
cream desserts. “I mean, who doesn’t like ice cream for 
breakfast?"
It's easy for one to be intimidated upon entering the 
hippie ice cream haven on South Highland Street. Yet, 
bombarded by the list of over 100 toppings and “swirl-ins,” 
this intimidation is quickly replaced by an overwhelming 
urgency to be creative. What, exactly, can I make? 
Everything, apparently.
Oh Yeah! offers obscure add-ons for their waffle and ice 
cream creations, such as balsamic vinegar, baklava, Nilla 
wafers, marshmallow fluff, and — wait for it — love. After 
some serious deliberation, we decided to put our waffle fate 
in the hands of the knowledgeable ice-creamista, Oh Yeah! 
employee Alex Esker.
The $7 vegan cinnamon waffle creation Schemes and I 
tested, with raspberries and chocolate chips baked in, and 
complete with a Kahlua ice cream topping, may seem a bit 
pricey, but the dessert is worth every penny. The waffle is 
crispy on the outside but has a flavorful fluffy interior, perfect

Student joins new website for college women
HerCampus.com, created by Harvard students, launches this Friday
Set to debut on Sept. 18, HeiCampus.com is an online 
magazine for female college students run by Harvard 
undergraduates, and senior English major and editor-in-chief 
of Carnegie Mellon’s first music magazine, The Cut, Elyssa 
Goodman, has been accepted as a writer and contributor 
to the magazine. Goodman says she is very excited to be 
“writing articles that appeal to the audience that I am actually 
a part of.”

Senior English major, Elyssa Goldman, is writing for the
up-and-coming website HerCampus.com
Founded by Stephanie Kaplan, Annie Wang, and Windsor 
Hanger, HerCampus is an expansion effort by these women 
who have already had a successful experience with their 
previous website FreezeCollegeMag.com, an online women’s 
magazine that’s been featured on rugby.com, seventeen.com, 
and collegecandy.com. Their clever tagline, “crimson is the 
new black,” sits below the masthead at the top of the website.
In a letter published in the summer 2009 issue, Kaplan and 
Hanger, editor-in-chief and executive editor respectively, 
wrote that they were excited to see Freeze grow into 
HerCampus, with plans to establish branches at different 
colleges across the country. They, along with Freeze 
board members Annie Wang and Kelly Peeler, were one 
of the winners of Harvard’s i3 Innovation Challenge — a 
business plan competition put on by the Entrepreneurship 
Forum, Harvard Student Agencies, and Technology and 
Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard (TECH).
Their website is currently still under construction, but 
according to their Facebook page, their magazine is meant to
“pave the way for the media industry to successfully make the 
transition online to keep up with today's world. By providing 
both national and local content, Her Campus represents the 
future of online media.”
Their redesigned logo is very attractive. The black-and-white 
photo features five silhouetted women, each active in their 
character, displaying a different facet of the female nature.
An earlier draft of what Wang, their creative director, had 
been working on, shows a looser hand-drawn outline of five 
different women. This one has a more Sex and the City vibe 
going on with them standing in a row, arms interlocked like 
they are all good friends.
"HerCampus is one of the few magazines aimed at an 
audience of college women. I think that what people can gain 
from it is feeling of connectedness to their demographic, one 
that has previously been overlooked by magazine publishers,” 
said Goodman. "HerCampus will be a place where people can 
read articles that actually pertain to them and their lives. Few, 
if any, other magazines currently do that.”
In the “Mission" section of their Facebook page, it says the 
editors “are launching Her Campus to provide writers with a 
needed platform to publish their writing while simultaneously 
filling a hole in the media marketplace, and advertisers with a 
new way to reach this valuable demographic.”
Using Ed2010.com, an online magazine job resource, 
Goodman applied, submitted her resume and clips, and after 
making it to the next round, she pitched stories within the six 
article topics; style, love, careers, dorm life, world news, and 
health. Twenty girls were selected from students that applied 
from colleges and universities across the country.
There are already suggestions for what will appear in the 
first issue on Friday. Facebook’s discussion board features 
two posts, one posing the question “What would like to see 
us write about?" with one response from Jean Kleimeyer, a 
student at Miami University in Ohio, saying, “I think a great 
topic would be the fat acceptance/positive body image 
movement.”
Elyssa said she could balance this commitment with her 
senior year studies, adding that she is “proud to be working 
on a magazine that was started with a strong entrepreneurial 
spirit and clear vision of its goals. It reminds me of The Cut in 
that way. I know from experience that this isn’t an easy thing 
to do, and I respect the girls running it very much for that 
reason.”
