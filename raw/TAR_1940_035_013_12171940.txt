Soph Hop to Feature 
Bunny Berigan’s Band
Affair on Jan. 10 
Will Be Formal 
For First Time
This year’s Soph Hop promises 
to be the biggest and most suc­
cessful one in school ihstory. It 
will be tradition breaking and 
record shattering. The fact that 
it will feature that inimitable 
“Miracle Man of Music,” Bunny 
Berigan, and his nationally fa­
mous orchestra is enough to rank 
the dance as one of the most out- 
stnding events on this year’s so­
cial calendar. But that, is not all, 
this is going to be the first 
FORMAL Soph Hop! Yes—tuxes 
or tails, and evening gowns. 
Here’s a break for the fellows 
though, corsages are absolutely 
taboo and will be checked at the 
door if any spendthrift does hap­
pen to get one.
This move might seem a bit 
startling, but because the boys 
have sufficient expense in buying 
the tickets and perhaps some re­
freshments after the dance, it was 
decided to limit the individual ex­
pense by banning corsages. Quite 
a number of girls have been con­
tacted and were very favorable 
toward the idea. Obviously, if 
the plan is to be a success it must 
be followed by everyone! This 
plan has been successfully tried 
at numerous other colleges, and 
it is felt that similar results will 
be achieved here since the fel­
lows should welcome the plan, 
and it is doubted that there are 
any girls who will want a corsage 
under the circumstances.
This year for the first time, the 
Soph Hop has been fortunate 
enough to secure, one of. the na­
tion’s leading name bands in Bun­
ny Berigan—“the Miracle Man of 
Music”—his trumpet, and his 
famous orchestra. Not only does 
the band feature the matchless 
trumpet playing of Bunny, but it 
will also present Danny Richards, 
the noted “Song Stylist.”
The dance will be held on Jan­
uary 10 from 9 till 1 at Thistle 
Hall, and the price of the tickets 
will be $2.00 per couple. There 
will be ticket agents in all of the 
men’s dorm and fraternity houses, 
and all of the Sophomore class of­
ficers will be selling them.
Mary Morris, Tecli 
Drama Professor, 
Returns to Stage
Mrs. Mary. Morris, of Carnegie 
Tech’s Drama Department, left for 
New York last Sunday to begin 
hehearsing for her part in Lynn 
Rigg’s play, “The Cream in the 
Well.”
After spending some 20 years 
on the stage and in moving pic­
tures, Mrs. Morris came to Tech 
last year from New York to di­
rect in the Drama Department. 
Some of the more popular plays 
in which she has appeared 
are: Eugene O’Neill’s “Desire Un­
der the Elms,” O’Casey’s “With­
in the Gates of Sean,” “Double 
Door,” “House of Connelly” by 
Paul Greene, “Suspect,” and 
“Queen Victoria.” “The Double 
Door” and “Queen Victoria” were 
given on the screen, and Mrs. 
Morris appeared with Anna Nagle 
in the latter. “House of Connelly” 
was given at Tech by our Drama 
Department recently.. “Suspect” 
was done in England.
“The Cream in the Well’ is a 
tragic stoi'y of America’s Indian 
Territory in the Southwest, and is 
similar in many respects to some 
of O’Neill’s works. It is one of a 
series of dramas depicting life in 
that section of our country, by 
the author. His other two plays— 
“Green Grow the Lilacs” and 
“Russet Mantle”—were quite suc­
cessful. Mrs. Morris will be the 
mother of the family in the pro­
duction, a part which the author 
described as the most interesting 
he has ever written. “The Cream 
in the Well” is scheduled to open 
in New York some time near the 
middle of January after a short 
run in upstate New York.

Mail Men
Tech Beats Pitt 
At Job Getting
Tech routs Pitt and Duquesne 
in the Post Office game! The 
Techites showed amazing super­
iority in learning 735 streets, 
with 45 out of 60 applicants suc­
cessfully completing the exam­
ination for temporary positions 
in the Pittsburgh Post Office. On­
ly seven fellows out of 75 appli­
cants from Pitt and Duquesne suc­
cessfully completed the examina­
tion for temporary positions in the 
Pittsburgh Post Office.
Tech also won another victory 
in the quest of jobs at the Rail­
way Express. Four Tech men are 
working to each Pitt man.
For the first time in any Post- 
office ' in the country, collegé’ stu­
dents are being given the oppor­
tunity to work dux'ing the Christ­
mas rush.
S. A. Bodkin, Postmaster of the 
Main Pittsburgh Postoffice, said, 
“We are initiating a pioneer 
movement in the history of the 
Postal Service. For the first time, 
we are giving college students an 
opportunity to work in the Post- 
office during the Christmas week. 
Upon • the record that this initial 
group makes, depends the nation­
wide adoption of this system in 
all the large Post Offices of the 
country. Viewing the results of the 
recent examination, I must ex­
tend hearty congratulations! to 
the Tech men.”
The boys were required to learn 
735 streets, the basis of a new 
modified scheme for securing 
temporary positions. Regular post- 
office employees must learn 6600 
streets in Pittsburgh, requiring 
two years and three months of 
work. Pittsburgh contains more 
streets in its postal districts than 
any other city in the world.
Printers Acquire 
Old Y Clubroom
With the resumption of school 
after the Christmas recess, room 
144A in Industries Hall will be 
reserved for the exclusive use 
of day students in the Department 
of Printing. The room was assign­
ed to the Department some time 
ago, but formal possession was 
delayed until January 6.
The room formerly belonged to 
thé Ycliib groiip, which was 
changed with the moving of the 
club to the new Union last year. 
The students of other engineer­
ing departments who have been 
using the room are requested to 
use the rooms set aside for them 
elsewhere; room 111 in Industries, 
room 100 in Machinery, and room 
115 in Engineering.
The use of the room by any 
students other than printing stu­
dents will be frowned upon, and 
the students of the Department 
of Printing are requested to use 
the room for study purposes only. 
Facilities for recreation are pro­
vided in the Union, and tables 
are sèt aside in the Commons for 
students who bring lunches.
Evening students may use the 
room for study purposes, but they 
are requested not to use it for 
any other purpose.
Calendar Change
• Because of the confusion caused 
by the article in last week’s TAR­
TAN concerning the change in 
calendar, we would like to em­
phasize the fact that the change 
is not to go into effect until NEXT 
YEAR, 1941-42.
The story was printed because 
of its general interest to students 
and faculty, in answer to the 
many complaints about the alter­
ations made in this year’s Christ­
mas vacation.
Mistletoe Sprigs 
To Go On Sale 
This Thursday
AXA is planning to help Santa 
Claus and the department stores 
to spread the Christmas Spirit 
(strictly non-alcoholic) by selling 
holly Thursday and Friday.
They are preparing to spiritual­
ize everybody. If you go into any 
Tech building, you will be accost­
ed. If, by any chance, you go to 
class, an AXA woman will greet 
you with irresistable holly sprigs 
and entreat you to buy. Don’t be 
a prig; wear a sprig. You will not 
be pi'operly dressed unless you 
do. Even those who eat lunch on 
Thursday and Friday will have 
to pass up those last few fudge 
squares and cherry pies to buy. 
holly. An extra special deluxe 
sales, campaign will be going in 
every eating place on campus be­
tween 11:30 and 1:30.
A few “cupidic” (copyright 
X16834) journalists will also be 
selling mistletoe. So, if you want 
to get that farewell kiss, here’s 
your chance. The sale is a silver- 
offering one. However, gold, plat­
inum, or any other precious met­
als will be accepted. Besides 
spreading spirit, the filthy lucre 
obtained in this sale of Christmas 
posies will be used in the publica­
tion of the Bard.

Rafters To Ring 
At Xmas Sing
Mortar Board has conceived a 
new idea in the way of a pre- 
Christmas Community-Sing. The 
sing will be held from 8:30 p. m. 
to 10:00 p. m. at Thistle Hall 
tomorrow evening.
Not only will Christmas carols 
be sung, but also popular songs 
and some fraternity songs. Mr. 
Burton Mustin, well-known com- 
munity-sing leader, who led the 
singing at the Freshman Recep­
tion, will again be in charge of 
the singing.
Free entertainment will be giv­
en by students from the Music 
and Drama departments. Paul 
Wines, ’41, will display some fan­
cy finger work with batons, after 
which Hazel Shermett, ’41, will 
offer one of her well-known op­
eras. Members of the Kiltie Band 
will offer a piccolo and tuba duet. 
A song by Mollie van Ameringen, 
’42, will conclude the program. 
Mary Louise Haugh, ’41, will be 
the accompanist for the evening.
Both the faculty and students 
are invited to participate in the 
Community Sing.
Don’t forget, free refreshments!
Xmas Chapel Council Sets Up Policy 
Board for Publications
Tartan Staff Voles 
To Reinstate Reich 
Under Probation
In an impressive and beautiful 
program—the last in 1940—the 
students will celebrate eh masso 
the coming of Christmas. Both 
ends of the foyer in the Fine Arts 
Lobby will be used to accommo­
date the crowd which always at­
tends this popular chapel. This 
Christmas means more than prev­
ious Christmases, and everyone 
is urged to attend. The time is 
11:30 today.
Dr. Doherty will preside, read­
ing the prayer and leading the 
ceremonies. It is chiefly to be a 
program of appropriate songs, 
hymns and carols. Three of the 
more popular carols will be sung 
by the student body; these are: 
“Silent Night,” “Oh Come, All 
Ye Faithful,” and “It Came Upon 
A Midnight Clear.” The other 
six selections will be sung by the 
choir. These pieces include: “Lo, 
How a Rose E’er Blooming,” Von 
Himmel Hoch, “I Sing of a Maid­
en,” “Deck the Hall With Boughs 
of Holly,” and “The First Noel.” 
The program promises to be ex­
ceptionally beautiful, and should 
prove an interesting hour for the 
audience.
Debate Team Ties 
State In Tourney
In their first tournament of the 
year on Saturday, Dec. 7, Car­
negie’s debate team tied with 
Penn State for first place. Seven­
teen schools were represented in 
the tournament held at Westmin­
ster College, New Wilmington, 
Pa. Among them were Pitt, Gen­
eva, Westminster and West Vir­
ginia.
The question for debate was: 
Resolved, That the nations of the 
western hemisphere should enter 
into a permanent union. Out of a 
total of 16 debates, Carnegie had 
ten victories.
Yesterday afternoon (under 
the sponsorship of Phi Kappa Del­
ta, national debating society) the 
Carnegie and Westminster teams 
again debated on the question 
mentioned above.
Both of these debates were held 
Oregon style. The purpose of this 
style is to break down the ten­
dency toward "canned” debates; 
that is, debates prepared before­
hand and read off from memory. 
The Oregon method differs from 
the conventional style in that re- 
baters are subject to cross-exam- 
ination by their opponents. Em­
phasis is placed on the student’s 
ability to think fast enough to re­
ply to his oponent’s cross exam­
ination.
Merry Christmas
Major Stanton 
To Head Defense 
Program at Tech
From the new defense training 
headquarters at Tech. Room 360 
Administration Hall, Major 
Charles B. Stanton will direct the 
defense courses offered here. He 
has been appointed administrator 
of Carnegie Tech’s program of en­
gineering training for national de­
fense.
Major Stanton will devote his 
entire time to the program, hav­
ing been relieved of his duties 
as professor in the Civil Engin­
eering Department until June 30, 
1941. The courses which he will 
direct are part-time and tuition- 
free, and will prepare technical 
personnel for the stepped-up de­
fense industries. They are sched­
uled to start January 6 and will 
last from 20 to 23 weeks.
Present plans are to train about 
1100 men at Tech. The courses 
and the approximate number to 
be enrolled, according to present 
plans, follow: engineering draft­
ing, 490; elements of metallurgical 
engineering, 200; machine design, 
180; testing and inspection, 144; 
and production engineering and 
supervision, 100. Evening courses 
will be given in all the above sub­
jects and, in addition, a Saturday 
morning class in testing and in­
spection. Most men taking the 
courses are expected to be those 
who arc already employed in in­
dustry and who wish to be fitted 
for more responsible positions. A 
high school education or Its equiv­
alent is necessary for admission.
Major Stanton, who takes over 
the execution of this vital rush job

Best Wishes Aren’t Heartfelt; 
Pro-Scrooge Move Is Result
By Juliet
The shops are selling a terrible 
toy this year. It is a talking 
Christmas card — price, • fifteen 
cents; vocabulary, two words. 
You caress a black ribbon with 
your finger nail and Santa’s fat­
uous face emits a piping “Merry 
Christmas.” “Merry Christmas, 
Merry Christmas, Merry Christ­
mas, Merry Christmas, Merry 
Christmas”—it’s enough to make 
Virginia lose faith in Santa Claus.
I have come to the conclusion 
that the Christmas Card Kringle 
is the spiritual father of Mr. Ar- 
buthnot, the cliche expert. He is 
the patron saint of all the bores 
who endlessly annoy us with their 
insincere wishes of holiday hap­
piness. “Merry £hristmas,” they 
squeak when we don’t have a 
date. “Happy New Year,” they 
shout as we start a twelve 
month’s stretch in jail. They 
have love on their lips and hate 
in their hearts; in short, they are 
“heels.” Beware of the old woman 
who repetitiously wishes you 
“Many happy returns of the day.” 
She probably hopes to dance on 
your grave.
The only person who really 
wants you to have a merry Christ­
mas and a prosperous New Year 
is the department store owner. 
He hopes you will not dislike your 
gifts enough to return them to 
him; he wants you to spend a
great deal of money in his store 
next year. Mr. Merry Christmas, 
the Yuletide horror, and all your 
following, I wish you a gloomy 
Lincoln’s Birthday, a broken­
hearted Valentine’s Day, a rainy 
Easter, a dreary Decoration Day; 
and I hope you spend Labor Day 
in the hospital.
Fortunately, in the greasy plum 
pudding that is the world, there 
are some raisins. I refer to the 
finest class of human beings—the 
Scrooges among us. Scrooge, be­
fore Charles Dickens succeeded in 
“reforming” him by an incredible 
series of supernatural events, was 
an intelligent, realistic, logical, 
/lard-working gentleman. After 
Dickens got through with him, 
he was a silly, senile, senti­
mental, pseudo-saint. The 
Scrooges (in the common sense 
of pre-reformation Scrooges) 
have none of the infuriating hab­
its of the well-wishing pests. 
They mind their own business, 
and they let us mind ours. They 
are not hypocrites. They do not 
hate us or pretend to care for us. 
They frankly do not give a damn 
about us one way or the other. 
I am one hundred per cent in 
favor of them. Agents are now 
at work laying the foundation for 
a wide-spread pro-Scrooge move­
ment. Everywhere they are rais­
ing the slogan: Long live Scrooge 
—down with Santa Claus!
The appointment of a Policy 
Board to regulate the policies of 
each of the publications arose out 
of Student Council’s discussion of 
the TARTAN editorial policy. 
This board, which will work on 
all the publications, will consist 
of the Editor, the Business Man­
ager of the publication, and. the 
Publications Chairman of Student 
Council, who at present is William 
Jamison.
Council also recommended that 
the TARTAN staff try to iron out 
its difficulties and accept Herbert 
Reich back on the staff. At a 
meeting Friday evening the TAR­
TAN staff voted to permit Mr. 
Reich to return to his position un­
der probation.
At the council meeting Mr. Cul­
len spoke for the committee that 
Student Council asked to study 
the TARTAN question; he sug­
gested that, since the apology that 
was printed in the December 10th 
issue of the TARTAN was accept­
able to the committee and the 
administration, the TARTAN sit­
uation was cleared up satisfac­
torily. As a preventativd measure 
to avoid the ocurrence of similar 
incidents in the future, the crea­
tion of the Policy Board was sug­
gested by James Sions. Acting up­
on this suggestion, Los Cullen 
moved that the threefold Editor­
ial Board be approved.
James McGarvey then moved 
that Student Council once and for 
all refuse to accept the resigna­
tion of Herbert Reich. When Mr, 
Reich withdrew his resignation, 
Mr. Shatzkin asked why these 
steps were taken when the senior 
stall had made it clear that ’they 
felt the job of Business Mlmager 
would be run more smoothly If 
it were no longer under the guid­
ance of Mr. Reich. The disagree­
ment was left up to the TARTAN 
stuff to settle before the next 
Council meeting.
Adjournment followed the ap­
proval of the appropriation of 
money to purchase 350 Christmas, 
cards for the faculty. Because of 
the Christmas rush this week* 
there will be no meeting tonight. 
The next meeting will be Jan­
uary 7, at 7:00 o’clock,
Priestley Play Will 
Open January II
First-nighters will be on hand 
Saturday, January 11, to see 
“When We Are Married,” a 
yorkshire farce-comedy, in the 
Little Theater, when it opens its 
one-week run.
The production is under the di­
rection of Douglas McLean, who 
directed the opening show of the 
current season, “Craig’s Wife.” 
The play was writen by J. B. 
Priestly, author of “Time and the 
Conways,” which was played in 
the Little Theater thre years ago, 
and also of “Dangerous Corner,” 
probably his most -famous play. 
During the early part of the pres­
ent war, Mr. Priestly was the most 
popular English news commenta­
tor heard over the British Broad­
casting System.
Action takes place in the mid- 
Victorian living room of Alder­
man and Mrs. Joe Helliwell, in 
about 1908. The occasion is their 
25th wedding aniversary, and the 
plot is concerned with the vari­
ous marital difficulties which en­
sue. The characters are the lov­
able “Sam Small’ type we know 
from “The Flying Yorkshireman” 
or from Pat O’Malley’s disserta­
tions on the radio.
Tickets for the play will be 
available, in the Registrar’s Office, 
about Tuesday, January 7.

Fight for Top More Games
Hoop Positions
Continuing a rapid pace and 
a fairly heavy schedule, the twen- 
ty-four teams entered in the In­
tramural program put forth their 
efforts in the games of the past 
week in order to advance their 
respective clubs into enviable 
positions as the top teams in the
Leading in the Independent 
League is the mighty Citcom Clan 
with three victories already tuck­
ed under their belts. Welch Hall,
Boss Hall, and the Sophomore En­
gineers—all have fallen prey to 
this fast moving and accurate 
shooting team, Paced by small but 
clever Paul Loveday, and tall jpr
Tony Prendes, their whirlwind at- M
tack has increased in ferocity with ip
each game, and is going to be |||
mighty hard to stop.
The boys from dear old Delta 
Upsilon have, by virtue of excep­
tionally fine team play and pass­
ing accuracy, positioned them- ||
selves as a strong contender for fff
this year’s Interfraternity cham- ff
pionship . Up to date this fine club ||i
lias won heavily over the Kappa J|||
Sigs and the Theta Xi’s.
Although neither the Kappa f||
Sig’s nor last year’s champs, the Pi K?
Kay A’s, have shown themselves ^
to be strong contenders for the ££
winners trophy, they do deserve £2
credit for putting on the most ^
thrilling game of the week. After v.'
a last second foul shot by the £—
Kappa Sig’s brought the score to 
a 20-20 tie at the end of the game, 
the Clyde-streeters went abead to 
win 23-22 in the extra period.

The Tartan gridders have elect­

honorary captain for the 1940 
football season. Paul was one of

team and certainly deserves this 
honor..

lowjackets for the evening.
Burch High Scorer 
Beginning the Ohio trip, the 
squad met Youngstown College on 
Friday night and was defeated by 
the score of 47-41, a last minute 
rally falling short of the neces­
sary number of points This con­
test was practically a one man 
exhibition in the person of Lee 
Mogus, who scored 30 points for 
the Ohioans. It was a good thing 
for the home team that he was 
hot for the Tartans matched them 
shot for shot in the first half, the 
score at half-time being 25-25. 
The Skibo scoring was well dis­
tributed among the members of 
the team, but Captain Red Burch 
emerged high scorer for the Tar­
tans with eight points. For twelve 
minutes in the second half the 
Tech passers were held scoreless 
while Youngstown upped the score 
to 42-27.
The final game of the trip end­
ed in a setback by the Case quin­
tet, the score being 50-46. Trail­
ing by the score of 13-9 at the 
end of the first period, the Tar- 
tant tied it up at 22 all as the 
half ended. In the third quarter 
which resembled a foul shooting 
contest more than a basketball 
game, the Casers pulled away 
and made the score 39-28. For the 
local boys, Red Burch and Her­
man Hennessey were high point 
men, tallying eleven points each, 
Bill Heckman leading for Case 
with 14 markers.
Burch, Patton 
Star for Tech 
On Ohio Trip
By Joe Thomas
Beginning last Tuesday night, 
the Skibo basketeers embarked on 
a three game losing streak that 
extended through Saturday night.
The “Yellowjackets” of Waynes- 
burg were the first to defeat the 
Tartans, in the opener of the sea­
son at the Tech gym, by the score 
of 41-34. On a two-game tour of 
the Buckeye State, both Youngs­
town College and Case School 
handed the Tartans setbacks by 
a close margin. Even though three 
defeats in a row does not sound 
very encouraging, the defeats 
have all been by slim margins 
and the local boys have been 
playing good basketball.
Many New Faces 
Last Tuesday night at the local 
gym, a squad of new faces made 
their appearance in the starting 
Tech line-up, with the exception 
of Captain Randall Burch who is 
the only regular to return from 
the previous year. Both teams 
were definitely off in regard to 
hitting the basket or the score 
would have been a lot higher; 
Wally Patton emerged from the 
contest as high scorer for Tech 
with eleven points, followed by 
Red Burch. Simmers and Brady

The freshman basketball team 
inaugurated its season last week 
by losing to Central Catholic High 
School by a score of 31-15; and 
team 31-26.
In Tuesday’s game Central 
Catholic took an early lead and 
held it throughout the game, as 
the plebes were never quite able 
to get started . The team showed 
considerable improvement in the 
Westinghouse game. In this game 
the high scorer for the plebes was

Engineers’ Dance 
Post Holiday Dance
Engineers Sponsor 
Annual Christmas 
Dance on Dec. 21
HOLIDAY GREETINGS
Music Element 
To Be Supplied 
By Don Palmer
To the tunes of sweet long ago, 
the Engineers and their lovely 
ladies will dance on December 21 
at the annual Christmas Ball to 
be held in the Gymnasium. Or­
iginally this dance was scheduled 
for December 14, but by a stroke 
of good fortune it was possible 
to change the date to the Satur­
day preceding Christmas when 
everything about the Campus 
takes on a holiday air. For many 
years this dance has heW. ti 
special place on the social calen­
dar and everyone who ever at­
tended the Christmas Ball knows 
its popularity to be deserved.
Don Palmer’s Orchestra will 
supply the rhythm and he prom­
ises only sweet swing music, with 
none of jitterbugs at all. Medleys 
of old tunes, those songs that all 
enjoy, will be heard from time 
to time. Featured with the or­
chestra are Kay Denton as vocal­
ist, Larry Miller and his electric 
guitar, Bob Stewart, the drummer 
who sings as a pastime, and the 
Saxofour, consisting of Don 
Palmer with three of his band.
Decorations will reflect the 
Yule spirit. Corners will be filled 
with evergreens of pine and 
spruce. Icicles hanging from the 
doorways with snow sprinkled 
about the Gym will complete the 
picture, except for the mistletoe 
(noto it, boys!) which will be 
much in evidence,
Girls are being encouraged to 
don their long dresses although 
the men promise to wear their 
traditional business suits. Corsag­
es will bo given to the first 200 
young ladies to arrive at the 
Gym,
Engineers will bo admittod up­
on presentation of Ihelr registra­

This week's column is sincere­
ly dedicated to my faithful and 
most worthy fan. Mortomer C. 
Sherd, whose letter to the editor 
gave me inspiration to jot down 
a.few notes of interest. The lack 
of space and "long dress competi­
tion” has been the reason for the 
absence of this column. To help 
make this a permanent feature, 
anyone with any type of news, in­
cluding scandal, is invited to con­
tribute. Drop it in the Plaid Post 
Office Box 353, addressed to Rum- 
oresk.
Congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. 
Russ Lahr. Rieta presented Russ 
with a beautiful blessed event 
Saturday afternoon, November 
10th at the West Penn Hospital. 
Prior to the stork’s visit, Jean 
and Bill Pensyl (they are newly 
weds of last June) were host to 
a baby shower in their new apart­
ment on South Highland Avenue. 
Pink gifts predominated and the 
stork obliged with a 0-pound 
baby girl—Christened Nancy 
Jean.
The absence of Earl Ross this 
semester is, due to his fall wed­
ding last September to a lovely 
lady from Washington, Pa. After 
a lengthy period of commuting 
between Pittsburgh and Wash­
ington, he established himself as 
a permanent resident in Washing­
ton with his bride.
Fellow Workers 
Arise! Get Your 
Insignia Points
Two more opportunities for 
Workers to get points are just 
around the corner—the Engineers’ 
Annual Christmas Ball Ipeing held 
Saturday, December 21, 1.940, and 
the Annual Student Council Post- 
Holiday Dance on Saturday, Jan­
uary 11, 1941. ¡There will bo the 
usual three periods; Decorating 
period, Saturday afternoon at 1:30 
P. M.; Saturday evening at 8:30 
P. M., and cleanup, Saturday af­
ternoon at 1:30 P. M, Two points 
per period Is the count on the 
Christmas dance and three each 
for the Post-Holiday dance. You 
can got two points for oach period 
of the Engineers’ Dance and three 
points for each period of the PosC- 
Hollday dance. Hero’s* a chance 
J’or fifteen points toward your In­
signia. Tho work Isn’t difficult 
and here’s a chance to meet those 
fellows that you pass on the street 
but don’t know. So come out and 
start work in earnest; toward1 
earning your Insignia Award.
Christmas comes but once a 
year and—as the saying goes— 
with it brings good cheer.
With business on its present up­
ward trend there is sure to be 
plenty of joy spread throughout 
the homes of Pittsburgh, for well- 
filled pay envelopes mean gener­
al well being. It is unfortunate 
that production of instruments of 
war was necessary to bring back 
the glow to our mills and the hum 
to our factories, but we can be 
glad that so far we have only been 
engaged in their production.
During the next two weeks most 
of us will do our best to bury our­
selves deeply enough in our prep­
arations for Christmas to com­
pletely forget the worries of the 
other world. For two weeks at 
least “Peace on Earth Good Will 
Toward Men” will fill the hearts 
of the American people. We 
should be deeply grateful that in 
one nation at least, this is still 
possible.
As we complete this, our last 
issue of The Plaid for 1940, the 
staff and editors extend to you 
our most sincere wishes for a 
Very Merry Christmas, and the 
Happiest and Most Prosperous of 
New Years to you and yours.
Tri-State District 
Represented Here
Students Come 
Many Miles To 
Attend Classes
The Evening School gathers its 
student body from all parts of 
the tri-state area. A geographi­
cal survey made by the registrar’s 
office shows that this year’s en­
rollment is gathered from 10 coun­
ties and 205 cities from the states 
of Ohio, Pennsylvania and West 
Virginia.
There are 18 students, who 
travel from 7 cities in Ohio to 
Tech while 7 students journey 
from West Virginia.
In Pennsylvania, Allegheny 
County sends 2488 scholars while 
Westmoreland County is well rep­
resented by 295 students, Wash­
ington County by 102 and Beaver 
County by 85. Pennsylvania’s 
quota by cities shows Pittsburgh 
with 1250 scholars, Wilkinsburg 
174, New Kensington with 07, and 
Greensburg with 05 Techniters.
The survey shows 72 cities that 
are each represented by one lone 
Tech man (or woman) and 34 
cities each represented by two.
Plaid Issues 
Terminated 
Until Jan. 10
Becausc of the annual Christ­
mas recess, the paper will not go 
to press until January 10, 1941. 
The Editors and Staff of the Plaid 
always lay out the paper on Fri­
day nights, and since this is the 
only night on which the work­
ers are able to meet, the pajDer 
cannot 1 be published until the 
above date.
If you’re disappointed because 
you can’t have the Plaid for a few 
weeks, just remember that NO 
Plaid means NO school, and that’s 
worth remembering.

Christmas?
Another Recess 
Date Is Changed
If you wake up with a hang­
over the evening of January 1st 
and it continues into the eve­
ning of January 2nd, when you 
have classes to attend, don’t wor­
ry. You can now cut the class 
with impunity. Why? Well . . . 
because Christmas vacation is 
scheduled to extend from Decem­
ber 20th to January 6th instead 
of from December 19th to Jan­
uary 2nd. With the dates of the 
Thanksgiving and Christmas re­
cesses being changed, we wonder 
what’s going to happen when 
Easter comes around.

Scene of Event 
Is Thistle Hall 
On January lltli
Evening Student Council will 
hold its annual Post-Holiday 
Dance on Saturday, January 11, 
1941. The Post-Holiday Dance was 
the last major function estab­
lished by Council and was first 
held during January of the school 
year of 1926-27.
The sweet music of Clyde 
Knight and his orchestra will be 
heard by those who attend the 
affair. Lovely vocals will be furn­
ished by Clyde, Herb Rohrer and 
the sweet voice of Janet Lee. 
The orchestra is composed of 
twelve members, and it plays only 
sweet music.
Clyde Knight’s music is not 
new in the Pittsburgh area nor on 
the campus He has appeared on 
the campus for the past few years 
and has played at KennyWood 
Park, West View Park, Mission 
Inn and the Hotel Schenley. Last 
summer Clyde also played at the 
Willows.
As the basketball season will be 
well under way, the dance will be 
held in Thistle Hall. Thistle Hall, 
because of its size, affords the 
best opportunity for decorations. 
Gay lights will be focused on the 
crystal ball and the band stand. 
The usually dull corners will be 
richly decorated with crepe paper 
and many colored lights.
This may be your last oppor­
tunity to dance to the sweet music 
of Clyde Knight for at the end 
of January the orchestra will
»mmmwmmmmjmmmamjtmm
travel to Detroit. The band has 
been booked for an indefinite en­
gagement at the Greystone Ball 
Room.
Social Chairman Joseph Gum- 
mo, his assistant, Lou Fosner,. 
and their committee have prom­
ised an enjoyable evening for all. 
The usual custom of giving cor­
sages to the first 200 couples will 
be followed, so come early to get 
yours. Music will start at nine 
o’clock and cease promptly at 
twelve o’clock.
As this will be the first dance 
of the new year, let’s have a large, 
crowd and give Clyde Knight a 
good send-off.
