THE ALUMNI ISSUE
OUR FARM
Camp Louis Carnegie is one of the 
recent gifts of the generous founder 
of this institution. Its possibilities 
are many and this short sketch may 
possibly start your mind along that 
bright trail. This tract of approxi­
mately 800 acres occupies the east 
bank of the Allegheny river at Gar-
affording considerable assistance and 
satisfaction.
The old mansion which is to be the 
central building of the camp, was 
built for one of the early oil mag­
nates and in its elaborate decorations 
and spacious halls reminds one of a 
castle. It has been remodeled and

GENERAL ALUMNI 
ASSOCIATION.
On Wednesday evening, May 8th, 
representatives of the Alumni Asso­
ciations of the four schools met in 
the parlors of the Margaret Morrison 
School to discuss the question of 
forming a General Alumni Associa­
tion. As the representatives of two 
of the Associations did not have the 
authority to take a definite stand, 
nothing more than a temporary or­
ganization was formed. The follow­
ing officers of the temporary organi­
zation were elected: M. R. Walton, 
Applied Science, chairman; W. H. 
Miller, Applied Industry, vice chair­
man and secretary.
The purpose of the General Asso­
ciation, as brought out in the discus­
sion, is to promote a closer relation­
ship between the separate schools 
and to work together for the best in­
terests of our alma mater. Not in 
the least is it desired that any asso­
ciation should loose its identity, but 
rather that questions regarding the 
whole group can be dealt with more 
intelligently and satisfactorily.
After a lengthy discussion the 
meeting adjourned to meet again 
Tuesday night, May 21st. The pro­
ceedings of this meeting will be too 
late for publication in this issue.
ALUMNI ASSOCIATION ROOM.
Through the efforts of Secretary Win.
H. Rieger the Association has secured 
the use of Room 2 in the Applied In­
dustries Building as an office for the 
Association. All meetings of the Board 
of Governors will be held there to 
which members of the Association are 
cordially invited. Mail addressed to the 
Secretary at the above address will re­
ceive prompt attention.

HOW THE TARTAN 
ORGANIZED.
The Committee made a special ef­
fort to get a letter from F. E. Foster, 
the first Editor-in-Chief of The Tar­
tan, but as he is at present in Mexico, 
it’s a pretty safe bet that he is kept 
too busy to write. Foster is road- 
master of the Ferrocarrie Sud-Pacific 
De Mexico Railroad. His address is 
San Bias, Siualoa, Mexico.
However, the following letter was 
received from the first business man­
ager of The Tartan, Jas. M. Sampson, 
who, together with Foster, organized 
and developed The Tartan. Some of 
their trials and tribulations are re­
lated below.
“The Committee.
“You have asked me ‘to write an 
open letter setting forth some of the 
difficulties in organizing a paper such 
as The Tartan, and something of its 
development and what it means or 
should mean to the Alumni.’
“I feel that the committee has put 
rather a difficult task before me, inas­
much as the subject really requires 
considerable expounding, and modes­
ty forbids my seeking to take up the 
entire issue with past troubles.
“Six years ago this coming sum­
mer the idea of a weekly publication 
was conceived by my worthy con­
temporary, Mr. Fred. E. Foster. 
Knowing that an "Editor” would be 
needed, he approached me with the 
proposition of becoming the guiding 
star of the editorial columns, and 
proof-reader in general, * * * at so 
much per; while he took upon him­
self the assiduous duties of the Busi­
ness Manager.
“Really and truly, (this to the Fac­
ulty), the hardest work I ever had 
while an undergraduate was to con­
vince Friend Foster that Destiny de­
manded he handle the pen and I the 
coin of the realm; while each took 
half of the profit or loss.
“So much for the ‘organization.’ 
The next thing was to get busy. For­
tunately, business conditions in Pitts­
burgh were very good at that time, 
otherwise the sledding would have 
been considerably rougher. Breaking 
into the advertising world with a new 
advertising medium means, literally, 
‘breaking.’ Heart-breaking, credit- 
breaking or broke, and shattering your 
ideals as to the wisdom of those busi­
ness men who do not look upon your 
proposition in the same light as your­
self.

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
The members of the Tartan Com­
mittee of our Alumni Association 
have my hearty good wishes for the 
success of the Alumni Edition of “The 
Tartan.”
I am very much delighted to see 
the close relation that is maintained 
between the undergraduates and grad­
uates of our Alma Mater. This re­
lationship is at all times apparent, but 
it will surely be made more mani­
fest by an issue such as they con­
template.
We must never lose sight of the 
purpose of our organization and al­
ways aim to strengthen the ties of 
friendship among Tech men. I know 
of no more efficient method of 
strengthening these.
---------------o---------------
Carnegie is now entering into a 
new era as an incorporated institu­
tion. The fact that we are no longer 
merely a technical school, but an in­
stitute of technology with power to 
grant degrees, certainly does make 
us swell with pride. Every alumnus, 
undoubtable, feels his heart going out 
more than ever to his Alma Mater 
and more than ever before does he 
wish to see her standard rise higher 
and higher each year. When a man 
or woman leaves her doors to begin 
the great battle of life, he draws a 
sigh of relief and is glad that he is 
free from her strenuous demands on 
his intellect. But, mark you, each 
day he realizes more and more that 
the splendid training he was given 
by Carnegie is his most valuable as­
set and he begins to feel more grate­
ful for it every day.
About this there can be no ques­
tion and if the alumnus is of the 
loyal stuff from which all Carnegie 
graduates should be made, his first 
thought will be of repaying his Alma 
Mater. He will become more loyal 
to her each year and more enthusias­
tic about her each day until presently 
his one big desire will be to help her
attain the height dreamed of by the 
Founder.
To be successful you must be an 
enthusiast and what better subject 
can be found over which to enthuse 
than one’s Alma Mater.
No loyal alumnus need ask how this 
enthusiasm may be expressed for he 
knows that the main means is by 
spreading wide her splendid oppor­
tunities. To the members of the 1912 
class and those that will follow the 
Alumni Association has this mes­
sage: Join the Association, attend
its gatherings and pass along the line 
wherever you may go all the infor­
mation about Tech that you can se­
cure. Make it your solemn duty to 
possess enough knowledge of the ad­
vantages offered at Carnegie to en­
able you to convince prospective stu­
dents that it is the school of schools. 
If you can do this you will be re­
paying a little of what you owe. By 
giving her prestige you will give her 
the boost she so well deserves. Al­
ways remember that you are a Car­
negie man. Forget your own indi­
viduality and do things worthy of the 
institution you represent.
If you are an undergraduate, re­
member that any snobbish act on the 
athletic field or in the streets will not 
be counted against you as an indi­
vidual, but rather against you as a 
Carnegie man.
1 If you are an alumnus don’t ever 
forget that your success in the indus­
trial world means giving your Alma 
Mater a boost. It is by what our 
graduates do in the world that others 
will judge our institution. That there 
is the big duty of our Alumni Asso­
ciation, to have its members make 
good, to spread throughout the coun­
try the news of Carnegie’s opportu­
nities, her splendid curriculum, her 
fine buildings, her useful equipment, 
her scholarly faculty, her magnificent 
endowment, her care of th body as 
wll as th mind.
Alumnus and Undrgraduate, do this 
and we will truly have an Alumni As­
sociation and an Institute of Tech­
nology, of which we may well be 
proud.

RECENT REORGANIZATION
SCHOOL OF APPLIED 
INDUSTRIES.
Considered a Great Stride in the 
Right Direction.
May 20th, 1912.
Dear Mr. Editor:—
You have requested me to explain 
in your columns the recent reogran- 
ization in the School of Applied In­
dustries. I shall endeavor to comply 
briefly with your wish.
The purpose of reorganization is 
primarily one of administration and 
not of instruction. The particular 
departments and the specific courses 
of study remain unchanged in aim 
and scope; the reorganization calls 
for a more centralized administration, 
and a more perfect coordination of 
courses and studies. The new plan 
of organization is as follows:
1. The Department cf Machine 
Construction, including Mechanical, 
Drafting, Machine Shop Practice,
Pactice, Patternmaking, Forge Shop 
Work and Foundry Practice, and 
placed in charge of Professor Charles 
C. Leeds.
2. The Department of Building 
Construction, comprising Bricklaying, 
Masonry and Concrete Work, Heat­
ing and Ventilating, Sheet Metal and 
Cornice Work, Carpentry, and 
Strength of Materials, and put under 
the supervision of Professor Clifford
G. Dunnells.
3. The . Department . of . General 
Equipment and Installation, includ­
ing Electrical Wiring, Telephony, 
Telegraphy, Power Machinery Oper­
ation, Motors, Sanitary Equipment 
and Installation and Plumbing, and 
placed in charge of Professor Hugh 
A. Calderwood.
4. The Department of Practical 
Sciences, comprising Mathematics, 
Chemistry, Physics, Bookkeeping 
and Estimates and Costs, and put 
under the direction of Professor John 
T. Morris.
5. The Department of General 
Studies, including English, History, 
Civics, Geography, Economics, Peda­
gogical Subjects, etc., and placed in 
charge of Professor Robert J. Peters.
The complex nature of the indus­
trial and manual training courses will 
make it necessary to have this work 
done in the different departments al­
ready mentioned. It has been the 
aim of those in charge of the work 
in this school to have each depart­
ment contribute a product worthy of 
standardization.
In the special Teachers’ Training 
Course, we are justly proud in being 
able to give to each student real shop 
work as well as the required theory 
in any special line which he may se­
lect.
This practical day and age demands 
of us work from all schools. Stu­
dents training to teach in any sub­
ject should not be content with any 
standard less than the best if they 
are to lead others. It is obvious that 
they should know the road over 
which they are to travel. Armed 
with this responsibility and enthusi­
asm a teacher is bound to succeed.
The demand for industrial teachers 
has never been as pressing as it is at 
present. State after state is adding 
industrial education to its public 
school systems, but no similar pro­
vision is being made to provide the 
necessary teachers. An insufficient 
supply of men qualified for this spe­
cial kind of work is the result, and, 
in consequence, the salaries paid to 
industrial teachers have risen rapidly 
until at the present day the average 
pay of efficient teachers in industrial 
schools is higher than that of those 
who enter the regular academic 
branches.
In the last report of the United 
States Commissioner of Labor on In­
dustrial Education this scarcity of 
teachers is thus referred to: “The 
most serious of these (referring to 
certain difficulties encountered at the 
Industrial Schools) is the matter of 
securing institutions really qualified 
to teach trades or vocations. A 
closer watch must be kept for intel­
ligent and ambitious young skilled 
workers who, by the offer of suffi­
ciently tempting salaries, may be per­
suaded to add pedagogical training to 
their present equipment, and thus fit 
themselves for teachers’ positions. In 
general, however, the problem of se­
curing properly equipped teachers is 
felt to be an acute one.”
The Course of the Training of In­
dustrial and Manual Training Teach­
ers at the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology is not to be a specific depart­
ment, but is to be distributed among 
the four schools. It will be possible 
for students in this Course to take 
desired and appropriate work in 
whatever school it may be offered. 
By way of example, an M. M. C. S. 
student taking a teachers’ course in 
drawing and design would have her 
pedagogical subjects scheduled in the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
and her technical subjects in the De­
sign School.
As I have stated above, the present 
reorganization is a matter primarily 
of administration, and will develop 
centralization and economy. It will 
relieve the Dean of mahy detail 
duties and will make it possible for 
him to visit oftener and get into 
closer contact with the leading in­
dustries of the Pittsburgh district. I 
am sure it is a great stride in the 
right direction.
Very sincerely yours,
C. B. CONNELLEY.

THE TARTAN3
A SUGGESTION.
It causes me almost as much pain 
to call attention to any shortcoming of 
our school as it causes a presidential 
candidate to do the same for his op­
ponent. But nevertheless I like the afore­
named candidate, must speak my mind 
though it “wrenches my soul.”
The school or schools have unveiled 
busts and erected tablets to our founder 
and others and soon will be giving de­
grees to others, while one who has 
worked hard for the cause has so far 
been neglected. Some four years ago 
the writer suggested that we pay honor 
to the Secretary by naming the athletic 
field after him, as Chicago University 
pinned on the name of the late Mar­
shall Field. Doesn’t is come naturally? 
You wouldn’t have to teach any Tech 
Grad to say “Billy Field,” and wouldn’t 
it call up memories? Wouldn’t it speak 
for itself? Student activities, funds, 
surpluses, deficits, etc., aren’t they all 
linked inseparably with the name? Every 
graduate as he or she receives the an­
nual blank asking its list of questions, 
hypothetical and otherwise, knows that 
conscientious efforts should no longer 
go unrecognized, so I for one am heart­
ily in favor of “Billy Field,” where our 
athletic fortunes may vary like the sine 
curve just as his popularity does, as he 
is found either with or against the stu­
dent body.

WORD FROM ACROSS THE
WA TERS.
Excavation for Campus
SENIOR BALL.
The Alumni are particularly in­
vited and urged to be present at the 
Senior Ball, to be held on Thursday 
evening, June 13th, 1912, at the Rit- 
tenhouse.
Thursday evening was chosen with 
particular thought for the Alumni, as 
the}" can attend the ball on the even­
ing of the 13th, attend the commence­
ment exercises on the morning of the 
14th and the Alumni Banqliet on the 
evening of the 14th. The heaviest 
part of commencement week is there­
fore concentrated and it is only nec­
essary for a man to lose one day to 
attend all three events.
The list of dances will be posted 
Friday, May 31st, at noon, in both 
the Science and Design schools, and 
it should be comparatively easy for 
the alumni to get their program filled 
out upon the following Saturday and 
Sunday, June 1st and 2nd.
Tickets for the ball will be on sale
the fellows that my home is always 
open to Tech men, to come as many 
and as often as they like.
“I will be very glad to do anything 
I can to help boom this Tartan scheme 
for the Alumni, or in any other mat 
ter pertaining to the welfare of old 
Tech.

UNION MEETING OF THE 
CIVIL ENGINEERING 
SOCIETY.
The last meeting of the Civil En­
gineering Society will be held on 
Friday, May 24th, 1912, at 8 P. M.
The alumni are cordially invited to 
attend, and in accordance with the 
usual custom, this invitation is ex­
tending to all Plebes electing the civil 
or sanitary courses or those intend­
ing to select such courses.
“Copenhagen, Denmark, April Sth, 1912 
“Dear Tech Fellows:—
“For little more than three months 
I have been back here in my native 
city, Copenhagen, Denmark, and now 
I am going to tell you a little about 
how things have been going since 1 
left dear Old Tech.
“Just after graduation, June 9th, 1911,
I started to work at Westinghouse and 
stayed there for four and a half 
months. About November first I left 
Pittsburgh and went west as far as 
Omaha. On my tour I visited quite 
a number of manufacturing plants, and 
saw very many interesting things. In 
the trip back East, I stopped in Pitts­
burgh and saw the football game be­
tween Tech and Rensselaer Polytech, 
November 25th. Since that dateT have 
not seen a Tech fellow, and I should 
certainly enjoy making a little trip to 
Pittsburgh and see the development of 
the new buildings at Tech, and also see 
Tech in some of the track meets this 
Spring. I am sure you are going to 
do well in these meets, as I know 
you fellows have the right spirit, and 
that counts for quite a lot.
‘Coming back to affairs here in Co­
penhagen, January 9th, I started to 
work in the Engineering Department at 
‘Titan Electric Manufacturing Com­
pany,’ here in Copenhagen, my work 
there is in the designing of both al­
ternating current and direct current 
machinery. I enjoy the work very 
much, and I believe theer is much to 
learn from it. The point is to get 
some experience and then a better job.
“About one month ago Copenhagen 
was the attraction for newspaper men 
of all nationalities. This time it was 
not Mr. Cook coming back from the 
North Pole, but it was the Danish ship­
building engineers that made the sen­
sation by building a large ship, which 
is driven by oil engines instead of steam 
engines.
“The oil engine is the kind invented 
by a German Mr, Diesel. These en­
gines have for a long time been used 
in power stations for driving electric 
generators, but they have never been 
used for driving large ships so it was 
a sensation when the engineers at 
‘Burmeister & Wain,’ a shipbuilding 
firm here in Copenhagen, made the in­
vention by which it is possible to util­
ize the Diesel engine for driving large 
ships.
“Burmeister & Wain have now com­
pleted the first dieselship ‘Lelandia,’ a 
ship of 7,000 tons displacement and 
driven by two 1,350 H P engnies.
“Recently when the ship was tested 
there were many shipbuilding engineers 
and representatives from all large 
steamship companies in the world, all 
of whom were very much interested in 
the outcome of the test of this new 
type of ship. The test proved a great
success for Burmeister & Wain.
“Lelandia is driven by two propellers 
each of which is connetced to a 1,250-H 
P engine with eight cylinders. There 
are two smaller Diesel engines each of 
250 H P, which drive an electric gener­
ator and an air compressor.
“The generators furnish electric 
power for lighting and for driving the 
windlass, hoists on the deck, and the 
steering apparatus; the electric motors 
for driving machinery represents 600 H 
P.
“The air compressors furnish com­
pressed air for starting the 1,250 H P 
engines.
“‘Lelandia’ is a beautiful ship, it has 
no funnel, but three masts, the middle 
one which is hollow is used for the 
discharge from the engines.
“I suppose it will not take long be­
fore this type of ship will be very 
much used all over the world.
“Burmeister & Wain, who have the 
patents, have received many orders on 
new ships of the Lelandia type from 
many different countries. They are 
now expanding their shops, as they 
are not able to complete all the work 
asked for.
“Now, this is about all I have to 
tell this time, and I send the best wishes 
for success to every Tech fellow.
“Yours sincerely,
“FRODE KJEMS.”

"But ‘get ’em’ we did! In the mean­
time, the ‘Editorial Staff’ was having 
his troubles getting copy. After 
writing many, many pages of stirring 
news, and obtaining the first proof- 
sheet, he found it all condensed into 
three or four columns. After recov­
ering from this practical demonstra­
tion of the force due to compression, 
he used another quire of paper by 
writing in a larger hand, thereby hop­
ing to put one over on the printer. 
But even that did not work. So he 
tried cajoling the printer into reset­
ting all the forms, using larger type. 
For reasons financial that could not 
be done, so it was back to the sanc­
tum for Freddie. This time, the third, 
enough copy was ground out, and 
early in October, 1906, Vol. I, No. 1, 
appeared.
“Here is where the Circulation De­
partment came in. For business rea­
sons, largely financial, (I was in love 
with this word at the time, so pardon 
its frequent use), the Business Mana­
ger and Circulation Department were 
incorporated under one head. The 
greater majority of the Faculty and 
students had a visible idea that they 
were being gold-bricked, but some of 
them for the sensation, perhaps, were 
willing to be the victims. Whether 
they ever recovered from that notion 
or whether they got the habit, I can 
not say, but the fact is, they came 
back each succeeding week and year.
"Right here I wish to be serious 
for a moment—even that first year, 
many students had an idea that the
paper should be run by the student- 
body instead of by a few. I took it 
upon myself to look up the history 
of other college papers. Those that 
were in the hands of the various stu- 
dent-bodies, with few exceptions, 
either lived a mediocre *or miserable 
exitsence, or died while those papers 
which were edited and managed by 
students financially interested in them 
gave value for value received. I think 
this has been more or less borne out 
in the short life of The Tartan. If 
the staff is of the right sort, who feel 
their responsibility and duty to their 
subscribers and advertisers, they can 
give a better paper to its readers and 
a wider circulation to its advertisers, 
when they, alone, are financially inter­
ested.
“As to what The Tartan should 
mean to the Alumni. In the first place 
it means more to an undergraduate 
than to an Alumnus. We all know 
what a ‘habit’ means. Well, I am 
sorry to say, quite a few of the Alum­
ni never ‘got the ‘habit’ of buying 
The Tartan while an undergraduate, 
and as the proclivity to buy decreases 
as the square of the number of years 
since graduation, I doubt very much 
if some of them can be brought with­
in the fold. Nevertheless, just a word 
to the present Circulation Department 
—find out when the next smoker oi 
meeting of the Alumni Association is 
to be held, get permission from the 
President to be present, and see what 
kind of a clean-up you can make. You 
will find some of the fellows there 
willing and ready to help you.”

INTER-DEPARTMENT MEET.
Leete Cup Won By Mechanicals.
The inter-department meet for 
the Leete Cup was held by the School 
of Applied Science last Wednesday. 
The athletes were favored by a clear 
sky and a moderate temperature, but 
the track was soft at several points, 
due to previous showers. A micro­
scopically small number of spectators 
occupied the grand stand, and a dis­
proportionately great number in­
vaded the field.
The Leete Cup was an unusual in­
centive to the different departments, 
and consequently the entries in all 
events were (numerically) up to the 
standard. All departments of the 
School of Applied Science competed, 
and were combined as follows, under 
the respective captains:
Sanitary and Civils, Captain Boots. 
Commercials, Captain Roessner. 
Electricals, Captain Peterson. 
Mechanicals, Captain C. M. Crawford. 
Miners, Metallurgists and Chemists,
Captain Frank Crawford.
The final standing of the depart­
ments was as follows:
Mechanicals ............................51 Points
Civils and Sanitary................33 Points
Commercials ........................... 9 Points
Electricals ..................................8 Points
Min., Met. and Chem..............7 Points

A Volunteer Stamp Router.
“I am connected with the Asso­
ciated Charities as a ‘Volunteer 
Stamp Router’,” writes Helen Bag- 
lin, ’11. “The work of this branch 
of the A. C. is to make a weekly visit 
to certain poor people on a certain 
route, and to encourage the children 
to save their pennies until they have 
the dollar necessary to start an ac­
count in a savings bank. I began 
this work in November, and now 
twenty-five out of thirty-five people 
have bank accounts, and more will 
have soon. It is exceedingly interest­
ing work.”
Margaret Harrison—“I believe that 
there are universal standards of right 
and wrong.”
Miss Arrowsmith—“No, I do not 
think so. Very few people believe 
exactly as you do.”
Margaret Harrison—“Well, all 
the good people do.”

THE TARTAN5
INTERCOLLEGIATE 
TOURNAMENT ON.
The Intercollegiate Tennis Asso­
ciation of Western Pennsylvinia start­
ed their annual tournament as our 
guests last Tuesday, playing on the 
courts of the University Club, oppo­
site the Hotel Schenley. The col­
leges taking part are Pitt, W. & J., 
Westminster, Allegheny, Grove City, 
Geneva and Carnegie Tech. The so- 
called “round-robin” style is being 
followed in the matches, each college 
meeting every one of the others in 
a match. Play is started at 9 A. M., 
and runs until 4 P. M., each day 
until Friday, and great interest is be­
ing shown.
Our team has been selected from 
the following men: A. D. Beeken, Jr., 
J. W. Savage, G. Douthett, W. Mil­
ler, H. J. Burgwin, W. G. Flood and 
R. S. Wilson. The team is heavily 
handicapped by the absence of E. E. 
Duff, Jr., Duff was elected captain 
for the year, but as Editor-in Chief 
of the “Thistle,” he has devoted so 
much time to that work, that it will 
be impossible for him to play this 
season. His absence breaks up the 
strong double team of Duff and 
Flood that has won a number of 
matches for the schools. Flood was 
elected captain to fill his place, and 
now holds the responsibilities of that 
position as well as those of manager­
ship.
Pitt is our strongest competitor, 
having defeated State, W. & J.,
Wooster and Lafayette, and playing 
close matches with Cornell, Penn and 
Minnesota. A victory over them will 
mean more than the local champion­
ship for our boys.
---------------o---------------
TEAM GOES TO GROVE CITY 
SATURDAY.
Following the second game with 
Duquesne on Wednesday of this 
week, on our home grounds, the 
baseball team will play at Grove City 
on Saturday. As we have six suc­
cessive victories to our credit, our 
boys are imbued with that self-con­
fidence that helps to win games, and 
will fight hard for a clean bill for the 
rest of the season. The game sched­
uled for Monday, the 13th, with St. 
Vincent’s was prevented by rain, but 
will probably not be played off be­
cause of our full schedule.---------------o---------------
MUSKINGUM ADDS ANOTHER 
TO OUR STRING.
After beating Pitt and tieing in a 
fifteen inning struggle with Du­
quesne, the Muskingum nine was 
rather easily defeated by our base- 
ballers on Saturday, May 18th, by a 
score of 10 to 6. Moorhead pitched 
his first collegiate game of the season, 
and made an ekcellent showing. He 
allowed ten hits but kept them so 
well scattered that, with the good 
support which he was given, he was 
never in danger. The team performed 
well at the bat, having 18 hits for a 
total of 25 bases. Capt. Vail was the 
star with a triple and three singles. 
“Bill” Modrhead also hit for three 
bases, securing a single in addition. 
His brother, in addition to his niound 
work, had two hits, one of which was 
good for two bases. Raisig and
Gearhart starred in thefield,cover-
ing the infield ingreat style.

PITT MAY NOW WIN MEET.
In order to bar our night students 
from their invitation meet on next 
Saturday, Pitt has adopted a ruling for 
that event in which they render inel­
igible any student from any college 
who does not carry more than fifteen 
hours of scheduled work per week. 
This would have but little effect on the 
composition of our team, as our own 
eligibility rules regarding scholastic 
standing will disbar most of the few 
men who come under that classification. 
However, this ruling, made for the oc­
casion, is so ridiculous and shows such 
utter lack of fairness, that our Athletic 
Association has refused to enter any 
team in the ontests.
The rules of the Western Pennsyl­
vania Intercollegiate conference have 
covered the requirements as to scholas­
tic standing as they would affect Car­
negie Tech. Owing to the nature of 
some of the courses offered by the 
schools, for example, architecture, no
set rule as to schedule hours could be 
applied. On the other hand, our eligi­
bility rules are stricter than those of 
most colleges of this region, and our 
athletic standing will bear the closest 
scrutiny. Under the circumstances Pitt 
will not be allowed to dictate rules for 
our observance.
The meet has always been regarded 
in this section as a preliminary to the 
College Championship Meet of the Con­
ference. The latter will be held at 
Sharon on June 1, and our team is con­
fident of winning the title for another 
year.

THE GRAND OLD MAN. 
Civil, ’09.
The following letter was received 
from the Political Boss of the Stev­
enson Campaign:
“The idea of having an Alumni is­
sue of the Tartan is a good one and 
will undoubtedly meet with the ap­
proval and assistance of all the grad­
uates of the C. I. T. I receive an oc­
casional copy of the paper from a 
friend in Pittsburgh and I assure 
you that there is no publication that 
gives me half the pleasurable emo­
tions or the interesting reading as 
does the perusal of the Tartan.
“In regard to myself since leaving 
Pittsburgh, I have nothing of inter­
est to report. I spent the Winter of
1909-1910 in New York City in the 
employ of the New York Central. 
While there I enjoyed to the utmost 
the really good music, theatrical shows 
and other methods for separating 
one’s self from one’s money, for which 
that city is famous. In May, 1910, I 
decided that, while New York was 
just the place for a genius to gain 
fame and fortune, I had no excuse 
for being there, and left for the West 
without the least idea of where I was 
going or what I would do when I got 
there.
“I stopped over in Pittsburgh, St. 
Louis and Chicago on my way, spent 
a delightful week in Denver and three 
weeks in Salt Lake City. All this time 
I thought I was trying to get a posi­
tion because I went to see a person 
occasionally about one. But in the 
words of Weller I was only “Pro­
crastinating.” I didn’t begin to look 
for a job until I landed in San Fran­
cisco after having viewed that fiasco 
known as the Jeffries-Johnson fight 
at Reno. Then with no money in my
pocket and a variety of unenviable 
emotions in my manly bosom I be­
gan “to throw my feet” and after ten 
days of hard going landed a job with 
the Sacramento Valley Irrigation Co. 
as level-man.
“I was with this concern about 
two months when a spasm of econ­
omy in the main office in Pittsburgh 
caused a reduction of the force and 
I was again looking for a ‘job.’
“I went direct to Portland, Ore., from 
the Sacramento Valley and by following 
the same methods there I did in San 
Francisco landed in a position in 
three days with the H. M. Byllesby 
Co. as transitman and have been with 
that firm ever since.
“My first work consisted of laying 
out a 66,000 volt transmission line be­
tween Springfield and Albany, a dis­
tance of 45 miles. Then I located 
several smaller lines as lower voltage 
lines. After that I worked in various 
capacities in the construction de­
partment until the work was complet­
ed. Last October 1 was transferred 
to this section when the H. M. Bylles­
by Co. have a $25,000,000 hydro-elec­
tric project under way. This consists 
of damming the New river in four 
different places near Pulaski, Va., and 
transmitting the power at 88,000 volts 
over an area bounded by Roanoke, 
Va., and Williamson, W. Va.
“My duties are of a varied charac­
ter and include the receiving and dis­
tributing of all material the super­
vision of construction of sub-stations 
in this vicinity and the designing of 
special line construction.
“I will greatly appreciate a copy 
of the Alumni number of the Tartan 
and trust that my tardiness will not 
debar me from this pleasure.
“Wishing you every success in your 
undertaking and in the welfare of 
C. I. T. I remain,
G. W. KETTER, '09.
---------------o---------------
“BOLO” SENDS A LINE.
“Your circular letter of the 2nd inst. 
has evidently been held up some­
where, having just received it—conse­
quently, my late reply.
“In answer to your queries, would 
say I am located with the Winfield 
Electric W'elding Machine Co., at 
Warren, Ohio, having been there 
since last November. I spend part 
of my time on the road and the 
remainder at the plant, designing vari­
ous types of wrelders. This makes 
a very pleasant arrangement of work 
for, as you all know, working continu­
ously over the board is not the most 
satisfactory kind of a job; and the 
traveling makes a very good change.
“As far as experience goes, there 
is little to be said, except that I found 
June, 1911, a rather poor time to leave 
school, for jobs were a scarce propo­
sition. However, I obtained invalu­
able experience in hitting up people 
for work and have come to the con­
clusion it is an art in itself.
“Much pleased to hear of the school 
receiving her charter. I believe we’ll 
stand foremost one of these days when 
it comes to technological institutions.
“Regards to the fellows.
R. C. HANFORD, ’11.”

6THE TARTAN
THE ALUMNAE ASSOCIATION 
OF THE MARGARET MOR­
RISON CARNEGIE SCHOOL 
FOR WOMEN.
The Association, organized in 
June, 1909, has high aspirations. In 
addition to its office as keeper of the 
door of the storehouse of School tra­
dition and memories, it attempts, and 
with already some measure of suc­
cess, to fill an office of more useful 
aspect. By furthering social and in­
tellectual activities among members, 
it strengthens fellowship and main­
tains a league in behalf of the best 
interests of Alma Mater and every 
alumna.
The Associations affairs are direct­
ed by an Executive Committee of its 
seven officers, who are, this year: 
Elizabeth Sheets Gaston, President; 
Jean Marshall Herron, Vice Presi­
dent; Edith Scott Glenn, Treasurer; 
Rebecca Shiras, Secretary; and Hat­
tie Merrill, '09; Helen Oursler, TO; 
Helen Stewart, ’11, Class Representa­
tives. To Mrs. Gaston’s far-sighted 
planning and leadership much credit 
is due for the auspicious conditions 
obtaining during the three years of 
the organization’s infancy.
This year has been a busy one for 
the Association, and the interest 
sliown and the work done by mem­
bers has been most encouraging to 
the Committee. The Calendar, open­
ing in October with Miss West’s talk 
on “The Spreewald,” has included 
lectures by Mrs. Vermocken and by 
Dr. Brashear, recitals by Mr. Mc- 
Greagor and Mr. Young, and by 
Misses Helen Baglin and Charlotte 
Schaffner; an informal tea, the Schol­
arship Fund’s Booth at the Holiday 
Bazaar, the annual subscription 
dance, and will close with the recep­
tion to the Graduates on Commence­
ment Day. The Association is very 
grateful to Miss West, Mrs. Ver- 
morcken and other honorary mem­
bers and friends for their aid in 
making the calendar an attractive 
one. The presence of Director and 
Mrs. Hatnerschlag, Miss West, Miss 
Bray, M iss Williams, Miss Brandt, 
Miss Baldwin and Professor Es- 
querre has added greatly to the 
pleasure and interest of the various 
monthly meetings.
The most noteworthy of all the ac­
tivities, perhaps, is the Holiday Ba­
zaar, for there is gathered and put on 
sale the handicraft of the “girls-who- 
work” and of the girls who are so 
busily engaged in the occupations 
classified by the careless recorder as 
“at leisure.” Trifles useful, useless, 
substantial or otherwise are offered. 
One may buy aprons, dolls, towels, 
collars and candy, calendars and bags. 
The proceeds from this sale are de­
voted to paying the tuition of other 
girls who will one day join the ranks 
of the “girls-who-work” and who will 
then, in their turn give gladly of their 
scanty leisure to earn something for 
the Scholarship Fund.
LETTERS FROM M. M. C. S. 
ALUMNAE.
Some time ago the Association re­
ceived a letter from Miss Kitty Mc- 
Mullin, ’09, who is a missionary at 
Tunghiang, Chekiang Province, 
China. This letter was read at one 
of the Alumnae Teas, at which time 
the members partook of celestial con­
fections and drank some of the “most 
polite” tea which Miss McMullin had 
kindly sent for the occasion. Since 
then, various extracts from her letter 
have appeared from time to time in 
the “Tartan.” However, not less in­
teresting than the letter are the 
“snap-shots” which were enclosed. 
One of them shows a laughing Mar­
garet Morrison girl enveloped in a 
shapeless, snowy white Chinese 
blouse; another presents Miss Mc­
Mullin in white shirt-waist and skirt, 
sitting in state in a traveling chair 
borne by coolies, all in readiness for 
the six-mile ride to the College at
Miss McMullin ready for a six mile ride
Hanchow. The third picture is of 
a corner of Miss McMullin’s room 
in the mission, and shows her illum­
inated copy of the “Prerogatives,” 
framed and holding the place of 
honor over the fireplace, and almost 
surrounded by photographs of Mar­
garet Morrison girls and their teach­
ers, while crowning the motto is a 
large M. M. C. S. pennant. A study 
table with its big lamp and heaps of 
books reminds one of the six to eight 
hours a day that she devotes to the 
study of Chinese, with the hope of at 
some time being able /to tell the 
young women of China in their own 
language something of western ideals 
and civilization.
“Yesterday afternoon a dear little 
bride said to me, ‘It is all so different 
with you—you are so superior to us 
—tell us what it is?’ The secret of 
it all is that they are beginning to 
realize the possibilities of a fuller 
life, a life of loving and serving.”
These little glimpses of Kitty’s new 
life, which her letter and pictures 
have given to us, have been a source 
of great pleasure, and it is hoped that 
in the near future she will find time 
to write more often.
M. M. C. S. ALUMNAE NEWS.
Household Arts.
’09.
The following is an extract from a 
letter received from an alumnus who 
thus declined to gather news for the 
“Alumnae Number.” We wonder if 
such a busy life as she describes is 
exactly—salubrious ?
“If I weren’t already somewhat oc­
cupied with teaching in Homestead 
and the Playground, ‘attending’ Tech, 
catering for another reception at the 
Schwab School, besides getting ready 
for our annual exhibition, I should 
all too readily place myself at your 
service, for less material purposes, 
yours to command, but I must beg 
of you to confer the honor on some 
less burdened shoulders. Forgive me 
that I must refend myself by being 
just this once not your,

Alice McKelvey is doing distinctive 
work at Kingsley House where she 
spends five afternoons and evenings 
each week. In the afternoons she 
teaches the smaller girls—10 to 11 
years of age— plain cooking, house­
keeping, household laundry work, 
and household sewing. This is done 
in the little apartment, comprising 
reception room, dining room, kitchen, 
bedroom and bathroom, which was 
ingeniously furnished with various 
odds and ends and made attractive by 
the plentiful use of white paint. After 
the girls have put the “little house” 
in order, they prepare and serve a
meal at which a mother is always 
present. In the evening the classes 
are made up of factory girls who are 
from 15 to 18 years of age. In all, 
165 girls attend Miss McKelvey’s 
classes during a week.

Alta Beymer, who since her gradu­
ation has been teaching Domestic 
Science in the public schools at her 
home in Tacoma, Wash., has evident­
ly changed her mind since the follow­
ing verse was written in 1909:
“Take me back to old Tacoma, 
People here are not the same,
Still they’re not as bad as might be, 
And I’m rather glad I came????”
Revised Version—1912.
“Take me back to dear old Pittsburg!
To my many faithful friends;
I shall give each one a handshake,
Long before the next month ends.”

Mary Daugherty reports that the 
fact that she “is in tlie very shadow

Woods Run Industrial Home where 
she has charge of the Domestic Sci­

the “Girls’ Club.” About the first

fields of labor.

of Dodge to a regular army post has 
been an important element in the sit­

A number of the Class of 1911 al­
ready occupy positions as teachers of 
Domestic Science, and, with the ex­
ception of Mrs. Anna G. Green, who 
is located in Williamsport, Pa., all 
have schools in Pittsburgh or its vi­
cinity. Marion Burns teaches in the 
Forbes School, Mary Hartmann in 
the Edgewood School, Sara Nolin in 
the Tenth Ward, N. S., School Pansy

Laureta Kempel, who has held a 
position with the Council of Jewish 
Women as manager of the “Penny 
Lunches” in the Franklin School, fin­
ished the year’s work on May 15th 
and went to her home in Ashtabula, 
Ohio. She will return to attend 
Commencement. Miss Kempel’s en­

The greater number of students

“Mrs. Carnegie thanks the Alumnae 
Association of the Margaret Mor­
rison Carnegie School for Women 
for the honor they have conferred on 
her in electing her an Honorary 
Member of their Society. She ac­
cepts the election with great pleasure

Those members of the Alumnae 
Association who had the good for­
tune to attend the exercises and fes­
tivities of Commencement Week last 
year, will recall with pleasure Mrs. 
Schenck Woolman, of Teachers’ Col­
lege, Columbia University, who took 
part in the program as the guest of 
the Class of 1911 and who was elect­
ed an Honorary Member of the 
Alumnae Association by unanimous 
vote at the annual meeting.
Dean West saw Mrs. Woolman in 
New York last week and bears greet­
ings from her to her Class—1911— 
and to the Alumnae. She wishes 
to be regarded as one of us, always, 
and hopes that the Graduating Class 
will have as happy a time at their 
Commencement as she had at hers 
here last year.

The sorrow of the old graduate 
who learns of the imminent departure 
of Miss Brandt will be tempertd by 
a sense of satisfaction in the knowl­
edge that she goes to a broader field, 
and that she will return next year 
to give lectures on institutional man­
agement. Miss Brandt, who has been 
a member of the Faculty of M. M. S.
S. for the past five years, has ac­
cepted the position of Director of the 
Good Housekeeping Institute, in con­
nection with the “Good Housekeep­
ing” magazine. After July 1st she 
will be located in New York City 
where she will be pleased to see any 
of the Alumnae at the magazine 
offices—381 Fourth Avenue.

T. A. C. DANCE.
The last of the Tech Design Club’s 
dances for the school year of 1911-12 
was held last Thursday evening in the 
Conservatory of Music on Dithridge 
street. There were about sixty couples 
in attendance, and every one seemed to 
enjoy a thoroughly good time. Stew­
art’s orchestra gave excellent satisfac­

of twenty-six dances was run through 
before one o’clock. The dances of the 
Tech Design Club are among the best 
held under the Tartan of C. I. T.; may

THE ATELIER DINNER.
The Seventh Annual Atelier Dinner 
of the School of Applied Design was 
held Saturday, May 18th, in Donegal 
Inn, near Westview. A ball game be­
tween the Class A and Class B men 
resulted in a score of 18 to 17 in favor 
of the Class Bs.
At the inn a very good dinner was 
served at seven thirty o’clock. A Ger­
man band, supplemented by horns, 
whistles, rattles and bells, of all quali­
ties and tones, souvenirs of the even­
ing, gave us melody long and loud. 
Clever menus, done by T. J. Raguere, 
found their way into every one’s in­

as a worthwhile and meritorious sou­
venir. The Faculty was well repre­

AN INTERESTING LETTER 
FROM AN ELECTRICAL.
“At present I am representing myself 
to be a machine designer and am de­
veloping an invention which accord­
ing to the inventor will put all the 
present day automobiles in the ‘also 
van” class. His statement seems to 
cover a great deal of ground so I 
do not intend to indorse it.
“The electrical business was too 
strenuous so I have dropped it alto­
gether for a time to try and collect 
my nerves again. For a year I at­
tempted to operate an electric light 
plant in the Kentucky hills. The local 
industries consisted of a brewery, five 
distilleries and the electric light plant. 
Every one in the town ‘toted’ a gun 
and they would hold target practice 
wherever they happened to be when 
the spirit moved them. Whenever the 
fire department answered a call some­
one would shoot the hose full of holes 
just to see the water run out. The 
town taxes were so high, the result 
of buying so much new hose that the 
people had no money left with which 
to pay electric light bills.
“Incidentally they objected to hav­
ing the electric service discontinued.
“The machinery with which we made 
electricity must have been originally 
designed to operate a saw mill. The 
six o’clock whistle affected it in a 
peculiar way. That is, the engine would 
proceed to shut down every night at 
that time in spite of all we could do. 
Sometimes a great deal of coaxing was 
necessary to induce the plant to run 
after that hour. It seemed hard to 
make the customers realize that elec­
tricity was not needed at night as they 
were rather insistant on having it. One 
evening the engine departed, leaving 
by way of the roof and one side wall. 
The next week I departed too and 
the last time I passed through that 
country I took a round-about way so 
that I did not come nearer than fifty 
miles to the town.

10THETARTAN
j “WHAT’S WHAT AND HOW.” \
There is a truly awful dignity in 
being an alumnus, or an “aluminum” 
as one of our reserve educators(?) 
has it, between whom and conven­
tional language there is a feud of long 
standing.
That innocent little Latinism 
“alumnus,” and its Hellenic pal, “phe­
nomenon!,” have to act as “sparring 
partners” for budding journalists, and 
after these half baked moulders (or 
rather blacksmiths) of public opinion 
have battered them beyond recogni­
tion, they fail to get even honorable 
mention.
It is 110 light job to be an alum­
nus and to support its delicate dig­
nity, that precludes the possibility 
of purple socks and frivolous neck­
wear when on duty. No orthodox 
alumnus could admit that he dallies 
with moving picture shows or mani­
cures his cuffs in secret with an eraser 
and talcum powder. What we need 
most at the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology (observe the resonance) 
is a few alumni with matured whis­
kers. What institution can hope to 
be educationally venerable with a 
squad of graduates whose faces are 
pink and nude.
Cannot some of our gallant alumni 
in a righteous cause establish an in­
timacy with the Seven Sutherland 
Sisters and locate 011 his virgin chin 
an experiment station for barbacul- 
ture, that will give us even a specious 
aspect of maturity.
Of course we cannot expect much 
in this line from our alumnae, as the 
last thing desired by the Margaret 
Morrison is maturity.
Of course the advent of Tech babies 
into the arena is going to help some, 
but the ardent pursuit of the pare­
goric bottle and the nocturnal relay 
races before an exacting audience of 
one is apt to restrict the extraneous 
usefulness of the devoted parent.
The casual and careless observer is 
prone to believe that the interest of 
the average alumni (we mean alum­
nus, drat the word!) is focused on 
the batting averages of the baseball 
team and the gory percentage of the 
football heroes; that the curves he 
shed his collar, necktie and some 
litres of perspiration to master during 
his undergraduate career, were those 
proposed by the scholarly youth who 
occupies the middle of the diamond 
in intercollegiate controversies.
And now that he has his divorce 
(his diploma, of course) his answer 
to the question of Alma-maternal loy­
alty is a zealous missionary campaign 
among the untutored youths with a 
sufficient chest expansion and sec­
ondary school muscular preparation. 
Of course he remembers in a dazed 
way that those incredible mollycod­
dles who are seeking a knowledge of 
science are useful as “supes” in the 
collegiate drama and add to the an­
nual alphabetical parade in the cata­
log.
Ob, say not so! The loyal alumnus 
deplores bitterly this oblique athletic 
activity—in a rival institution. He 
waxes hoarsely eloquent in conversa­
tion with the hesitating thirster for
knowledge. He palpitates with prose­
lyting fervor while he demonstrates 
to the vacillating brother how “easy” 
are the professors and what a cinch 
it is to get a C—in athletics. And 
there again is the rapture of wallop­
ing the plebes in his sophomore year, 
and the glories of certain fraternal 
activities; and incidentally, of course, 
there are the courses in engineering.
Oh, yes, certainly the academic de­
grees are desirable, but the degree of
O. G. (old grad.) has them all faded 
to a sickly green.

Last Saturday a group of Tech 
men boarded an elevator in the estab­
lishment of Joseph Horne Co. and 
proceeded upward. The following 
men were to be seen: Fleming,
Wright, Evans, Sanders, Foster, H. 
.P. Smith, Bearinger, Gilpin, Bell, Fin- 
kel, Fitzgibbon, Andrews, Martin and

At the second floor the fellows filed 
out and a young lady employee de­
manded what they wanted in the 
ladies’ department. The unanimous 
reply was “corsets.” They were 
ushered into a department labeled “A 
la Spirits Corsets;” other signs read 
“De Bevoise,” “Nuform,” etc. I think 
it must be the last that were gotten. 
The men were caged in small two 
by twice rooms and fitted with the 
article above named. Yes, by ladies! 
Dresses wrere also supplied. Flem­
ing was the first to reappear. He 
was wearing a “Crepe de” something 
or other over a lavendar slip. Gee, 
he looked funny. Well, everyone 
got their turn. Most of the fellows 
were pulled into a 22 or 23 inch waist 
measurement. Sanders proved to be 
the smallest dimension holder at 20 
inches, beating Gilpin who was the 
tallest by one inch. It looked for a 
long while as if the latter would cop 
the title but Sanders, who was last 
to be fitted, won. Evans was the 
prettiest lady except that she needed 
a shave. Wright tried to make a 
date with her. Finkle and Chalfant, 
two of our prima donnas, had to have 
their garments altered and while 
waiting for the fitter they flirted with 
the men on the street. A young 
lady in a dentist’s office was also en­
tertained by Finkel who, with one of 
the men, did the turkey trot. Well, 
it was a fine time those girls had.
E. G. Hamilton went out to school 
to get a book for Mgr. Smith and 
returned with a large tin box. Funny 
book. Eh? As each fellow left the 
store he was rubbered at by all the 
clerks and cash girls who got their 
heads together. One was heard to 
say: “He was all diked out in a girl’s 
rigout.” This ended the trip and it 
had been so enjoyable that some 
wanted to go back and get fitted all 
over again. Chalfant, especially, who 
had been as finiky as an old woman 
Now fellows, you did not get in on 
this fun, but your opportunity will 
come on June 3, when you will be 
expected to be seen in a box or one 
of the front rows. Save now and 
you can see it all. Take your best 
girl and cut the other fellow out.

CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY : : :
T
HE Carnegie Institute of Technology consists of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied Science—Offers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied Design—Offers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied Industries—Offers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec­
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School—For women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be­
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night Courses—The four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.
