Carnegie Mellon’s Action 
Project (CMAP), an organization 
designed to support underrepre­
sented ethnic groups such as Af- 
rican-American university stu­
dents, is expanding its program 
for next year. Due to increased 
resources, the organization will 
now be able to cater to the incom­
ing Hispanic students.
According to CMAP Program 
Director Gloria Hill, the program 
is necessary for making African- 
American and Hispanic students 
more comfortable on the predomi­
nantly white CMU campus.
“There are 207 African-Ameri- 
can students on campus out of the 
approximately 4000 students on 
campus. Sometimes they may feel 
disconnected or isolated in this 
atmosphere. We help the students 
go into the mainstream,” said Hill. 
“We also help students so that 
they will not be overwhelmed by 
the academically challenging en­
vironment.
! CMAP encompasses several 
programs that provide support 
for involved students. These pro­
grams include tutoring services, 
counseling, personal development 
programs, summer employment 
opportunities, and general em­
ployment programs. The organi­
zation also plays a large role in 
recruiting minority groups.
This is one of the most com­
petitive major universities in the 
country,” said Hill. “We try to 
recruit the small pool of very tal­
ented African-Americans andHis- 
panics. We serve CMU as an ad­
ditional resource. It is very im­
portant to recruit these students. 
We must recognize that very soon 
one-third of the United States 
population will be of color and we 
must adjust to it.”
The organization hopes to clear 
up what it sees as misconceptions

ACS names six scholars
By DAVID LADEK
Tartan News Editor
Six Carnegie Mellon students 
have been named Andrew Carn­
egie Presidential Scholars, accord­
ing to the Andrew Carnegie Soci­
ety.
The six students, all juniors, 
are Trudy Biggs, Christopher 
Bochna, Nicole Brockmann, 
Rajesh Putcha, Hyun Shin, and 
David Silvester.
According to Dolores Hunter, 
an administrative assistant for 
annual giving, “The students will 
be working with the society by
participating in activities to sup­
port the University.”
The Andrew Carnegie Society, 
established in 1972, is composed 
of alumni and friends of the Uni­
versity who espouse the philan­
thropic principles of university 
founder Andrew Carnegie in their 
support of Carnegie Mellon Uni­
versity.
The Presidential Scholars each 
receive $1,500 at the end of their 
senior year to aid in the transi­
tion from student to working pro­
fessional.
The society will also recognize 
24 other scholars at its meeting
Saturday.
Biggs, a drama major in the 
production/direction option, has 
been involved with a variety of 
Carnegie Mellon productions.
She has been head stage man­
ager, a teacher, and a counselor 
at Stagedoor Manor in New York. 
She has also worked on produc­
tions at the Upstairs Theatre here 
in Pittsburgh, and the North 
Shore Theatre in Boston.

CMU
Lawsuit alleges sexual misconduct by Cyert
By A. J. DURAZZI
Tartan Features Editor 
& JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Then-President Richard M. Cyert made 
sexual advances to a Carnegie Mellon 
employee when she worked for him in 
August 1972, according to a suit filed by 
the employee in federal court in Novem­
ber 1989.
After the employee resisted Cyert’s 
advances, Cyert worked for 16 years to 
deny her promotions and g6t her fired, 
finally succeeding in 1988, according to 
the legal complaint.
The complaint also accuses CMU of 
age and sex discrimination in its promo­
tion and dismissal decisions.
Although Cyert and other University 
officials strongly deny the allegations 
made by 22-year CMU employee Patricia 
Tanner, the suit was settled out of court 
by the University in September for an 
undisclosed amount.
“It’s just plain nonsense, and I’m not 
too interested in talking about it,” Cyert 
said of the sexual advances allegation.
Current President Robert Mehrabian, 
who took Cyert’s job last July, also de­
fended Cyert. “I totally believe in his 
integrity and I cannot believe that such
allegations could possibly be true,” he 
said. “The allegations are 
unsubstantiated and unsubstantiable.”
SUP A Dean Alfred Blumstein denied 
that Tanner was fired because of sex or 
age discrimination. When questioned 
about these issues, Blumstein said, “Ab­
solutely not. She was replaced by a 
woman; and [Tanner] was not very old.” 
Tanner was 55 at the time she was fired.
Tanner and employees of CMU are 
legally barred from discussing the de­
tails of the case by a clause in the settle­
ment. However, Tanner’s complaint tells 
her side of the story and Senior Vice 
President for
Brannick told The Tartan that “if you 
read [our answer], then I think you would 
understand CMU’s position.”
“It was a horrendous experience that 
I’m still having a difficult time getting 
through,” Tanner told The Tartan.
Tanner came to CMU in February 1966 
as a clerical technician in the Physics 
Department. She worked as Cyert’s sec­
retary from 1967 to 1971, while he was 
acting dean and dean of GSIA, before she 
moved to a financial administrative po­
sition in GSIA in 1971-72. When Cyert 
become president in the summer of1972, 
Tanner moved to the president’s office as 
and financial
assistant to the president.
Tanner’s complaint alleges that “On 
August 19, 1972, Ms. Tanner ... had a 
meeting with President Cyert in his of­
fice where President Cyert made unwel­
come sexual advances towards Ms. Tan­
ner who resisted these advances. In or­
der to resist the sexual advances made 
by President Cyert, Ms. Tanner had to 
physically restrain President Cyert.
“After the events of August 19,1972, 
Ms. Tanner, a competent financial con­
sultant, was given no duties of any sig­
nificance.”
Both accusations are specifically de-

THIS JUST IN...
Congress and President end national rail union strike
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress 
swiftly passed and President Bush signed 
legislation early Thursday that would 
halt a day-old rail strike and put Ameri­
can travel and commerce back on track.
Bush was awakened, and he signed 
the bill at 1:39 am in the White House 
residential quarters, spokesman John 
Herrick said. The measure, which was 
passed by Congress just before midnight 
Wednesday, could put some 235,000 rail 
workers back on the job today.
A spokesperson for labor, declining to 
be named publicly, said the unions would 
“honor the law” and return to work.
George Whaley, a spokesman for the 
Association of American Railroads, said, 
“There will be no further interference 
with commerce.”
“We are gratified that the Congress 
and President Bush have moved so 
quickly to end the rail strike,” Mike 
Walsh, chairman of Union Pacific Rail­
road and head of the AAR, said in a 
statement.
The government intervened after rail­
road labor unions and major freight car­
riers were unable to reach a new contract 
despite three years of trying and a three- 
month “cooling-off’ period.
Eight labor unions set up picket lines 
at 7 am Wednesday, shutting down vir­
tually all the nation’s rail freight lines 
and disrupting some passenger traffic.
The measure sets up a new emergency 
board to deal with remaining issues, and 
will impose a final contract settlement 
within 65 days if labor and management
fail to do so.
It also puts in to effect some provisions 
of a previous board’s recommendations 
that were not in dispute, notably a three 
percent wage increase in July and a 
provision, never before tried, making 
workers share in health insurance costs.
Both the unions and the railroads will 
have to accept whatever the new panel 
recommends if they cannot agree among 
themselves. Unions could not resort to 
another strike and railroad companies 
could not engage in a lockout.
Congress acted with uncommon speed 
to stop the walkout, the first in nearly a 
decade. Democrats and Republicans alike 
said the government could not tolerate 
any strike that endangered an economy 
already mired in a slump.
The House passed the measure 400-5. 
The Senate immediately bypassed nor­
mal parliamentary procedures, declar­
ing the bill “deemed to be passed” on 
arrival, and sent it to the White House 
without any formal vote.
“It stops the strike and gets America 
moving again... without tilting the scales 
toward labor or management,” said 
Representative Norman Lent (R-N.Y.).
“This accord is good for labor, good for 
the economy, and good for the-nation,” 
said Senator Edward Kennedy (D- 
Mass.), chair of the Senate Labor and 
Human Resources Committee.
The strike halted shipments of every­
thing from coal to auto parts and inter­
fered with most Aintrak passenger trains, 
except in the Northeast corridor from
Washington to Boston, and some com­
muter services.
White House spokesman Marlin' 
Fitzwater had said the immediate cost of 
the strike was $50 million a day. It could 
have skyrocketed to $630 million daily if 
the walkout had gone on for two weeks.
During the 65 days, neither side could' 
change the working conditions of mem­
bers of the eight unions. New contracts 
involving three other unions that earlier 
reached agreement with the companies 
would be allowed to go into effect.
The bill gives what Representative 
Dennis Eckart (D-Ohio) called a “second 
chance” to track maintenance workers 
and train crewmen who felt they were 
not treated fairly in the presidential 
board’s settlement recommendations.
Democrats, White House civil 
rights bills show similar features
WASHINGTON (DJ) — If the civil rights bill 
introduced by House Democrats is a quota bill, 
then so is the administration measure.
And if the White House version is inadequate to 
fight the problems of race and sex discrimination, 
then so is its congressional counterpart.
That’s the view of many legal scholars who are 
struck more by the similarities between the two 
civil rights measures than by their differences. “If 
there were no political overtones, reasonable 
people would have come up with agreed language 
by now,” observes Harvard’s Archibald Cox, the 
former Watergate prosecutor who served as so­
licitor general during the Kennedy administra­
tion.
Many of the heated arguments over the word­
ing of the bill focus on matters that are largely 
symbolic, most notably the quota issue. Republi­
cans claim that the Democratic bill will compel 
employers to hire or promote a certain fixed 
proportion of minority and female workers. “The 
bill is and was quota legislation,” Clayton Yeutter, 
the GOP national chairman, said yesterday. “It is 
perceived as such by the American people and is 
justly criticized for that.”
The language of both bills, though, makes that 
a far murkier issue. Neither bill explicitly re­
quires quotas; the real question is at what point 
tough legal language makes employment or hir­
ing discrimination so easy to prove and punish 
that employers are likely to impose quotas just to 
protect themselves against potential lawsuits. 
And even Republicans admit they aren’t sure 
where that dividing line is.
The bills do contain important differences. 
Congress’s version is more generous in granting 
damages to plaintiffs charging discrimination, 
and goes further in overturning the Supreme 
Court cases that triggered the debate, most nota­
bly Wards Cove Packing Co. vs. Antonio. That case 
shifted the burden of proof from employers to-
ward plaintiffs in cases where employers engage 
in practices that disproportionately exclude mi­
norities and women.
The congressional bill would reverse the 1989 
decision completely—and then some, say critics 
in the business community. The administration 
bill proposes a shift back toward employers as 
well, but wouldn’t go nearly as far.
Still, the legal distinctions between the two 
bills can be fine indeed. One dispute is over the 
difference between employee selection practices 
bearing “a significant relationship to successful 
performance on the job” and those bearing a 
“manifest relationship to the employment in 
question.” The administration wants the “mani­
fest” wording, because it is easier for an employer 
to defend in court.
Even where the disagreements are more obvi­
ous, they usually represent a retreat by Congress 
or.the White House from a previous compromise.
A good example is the issue of damages, one of 
the largest differences between the Democratic 
and Republican bills. Currently, women who sue 
employers for sex discrimination can’t collect 
punitive damages, while minorities who sue for 
race discrimination can.
Last year the Democrats proposed allowing 
female plaintiffs to collect punitive damages in 
certain sex discrimination cases where the plain­
tiff has proven intentional discrimination. To 
make their bill more palatable to the administra­
tion, the Democrats eventually agreed to accept 
a $150,000 partial cap on the damages. This 
year, however, the Democrats retreated from 
that position; their new bill does not allow a cap.
Meanwhile, the administration, which last fall 
allowed punitive damages of as much as $150,000 
in some intentional sex discrimination cases, 
now argues that such monetary awards should 
not be permitted except in certain cases involv­
ing harassment.

Refugee situation sees progress
WASHINGTON (DJ) — The State Department 
says that “tremendous progress” is being made in 
helping Iraqi refugees in Turkey and around the 
Iraqi-Turkish border, but that refugees in Iran are 
not quite as well-off.
The U.S. has become directly involved in the 
efforts to help Iraqi Kurds fleeing to Turkey, with 
some U.S. reconnaissance missions seeking out 
areas for more refugee camps. It is estimated that 
about 450,000 refugees have entered Turkey, while 
about 400,000 are just outside the border.
But in Iran, from which the U.S. has tried to keep
its distance because of long-standing strains on 
U.S.-Iranian relations, the State Department had 
no similar word of progress on the refugee problem. 
About one million refugees, mostly Kurds, have! 
crossed into Iran, while about 500,000 are moving 
toward the border, the department estimates. The 
U.S. is letting the European Community and inter­
national relief organizations, such as the Interna­
tional Committee of the Red Cross, handle refugees 
in that area.
The U.S. vows that refugees in all areas in and 
around Iraq will be protected.

WASHINGTON (D J) — Presi­
dent Bush Thursday promised to 
“re-invent American education,” 
and announced plans to design a 
system of “New American Schools” 
for the year 2000 and beyond.
In a major domestic policy ad­
dress, Bush said that “this idea is 
simple but powerful: Put
America’s special genius for in­
vention to work for America’s 
schools.”
Bush also announced creation 
of a New American Schools De­
velopment Corporation: a private 
sector research and development 
fund of at least $150 million to 
generate innovation in education.
“With the results of this R&D in 
hand, I will urge Congress to pro­
vide $1 million in start-up funds 
for each of 535 New American 
Schools — at least one in every 
congressional district — and to 
have them up and running by 
1996,” Bush said.
Bush said that the objective of 
the “New American Schools” plan 
is to achieve the new standards 
for the five core subjects set by the
administration and operate on a 
budget comparable to conven­
tional schools.
“The architects of the New 
American Schools should break 
the mold, build for the next cen­
tury, re-invent the American 
school,” said Bush. “No question 
should be off-limits, no answers 
assumed. We’re not after one 
single solution for every school.”
Bush said his administration is 
working closely with governors to 
set new standards for schools, 
teachers and students in the five 
core subjects: math, science, En­
glish, history, and geography.
Bush said that “we will develop 
voluntary national tests for 4th, 
8th, and 12th graders in the five 
core subjects. These American 
Achievement Tests will tell par­
ents and educators, politicians, 
and employers just how well our 
schools are doing,” said Bush.
Bush also said that parents 
should be given the right to choose 
which schools their children at­
tend. “This approach will create 
the competitive climate that
stimulates excellence in our pri? 
vate and parochial schools as 
well,” said Bush.
Bush officials said that the 
president will promote state and 
local school programs as part of 
his AMERICA 2000 Excellence in 
Education Act of 1991. Part of the 
bill will be a $200 million Educai 
tion Certificate Program Support 
Fund that will provide incentive 
grants to local school districts with 
qualified education certificate pro­
grams that enhance parental 
choice.
Bush also urged business and 
labor cooperatively to develop — 
and then to use — world-class 
standards and core proficiencies 
for each industry. Federal re­
sources will jDe sought to provide 
start-up assistance, according to 
administration officials.

Ex-employee alleges sex, age discrimination
TANNER, from page 1
nied without further explanation 
in CMU’s answer to the suit, filed 
December 4,1989.
The complaint goes on to state, 
“In March 1973 President Cyert 
asked Ms. Tanner to find other 
employment.” CMU’s answer re­
sponds by saying “[CMU] admits 
thatinor aboutMarchl973, Presi­
dent Cyert indicated to [Tanner], 
in substance, that other employ­
ment would have to be found. 
[CMU] denies each and every 
other allegation of paragraph 15 
of the Complaint.”
Walter DeForest, the 
University’s attorney in the case, 
said that prior to March 1973, 
“Cyert had indicated performance 
difficulties [with Tanner].” But 
Tanner claims that she received 
“numerous” salary increases is­
sued by Cyert while the two 
worked at GSIA.
After leaving the president’s 
office, Tanner became a financial 
administrator for Budget Ser­
vices. Her complaint alleges that 
in March 1974 she was fired by 
Harold Larsen, head of Budget 
Services, and that her termina­
tion “was without just cause and 
was directly the result of Ms. Tan­
ner resisting the sexual advances 
of President Cyert.” CMU’s com­
plaint denies this allegation.
Larsen could not be located by 
The Tartan for comment.
The complaint says that Tan­
ner hired an attorney, Neal 
Cramer, who “advised [CMU] that 
its termination of Ms. Tanner was 
unjustified and demanded that 
Ms. Tanner be rehired. Shortly 
thereafter, Ms. Tanner was re­
hired by the Defendant,” her com­
plaint says.
According to DeForest, how­
ever, Tanner was not fired by the 
University then and there was no 
correspondence with Cramer.
But, in a telephone interview 
yesterday, attorney Neal Cramer 
told The Tartan that he did work 
on behalf of Tanner in 1974. 
“There was never a case filed, but 
there was some correspondence,” 
he said. When asked if Tanner’s 
dismissal in 1974 was related to 
an incident of sexual harassment, 
Cramer said, “there was some talk 
of that.”
Cramer said he was not sure if 
Tanner was fired or merely 
warned that she would be laid off.
In 1975, then-SUPA Dean Otto 
Davis was asked by Cyert to fire 
Tanner, according to her com­
plaint. Davis allegedly refused to 
do so. CMU’s answer denies the 
allegation with no further expla­
nation, and Davis could not be 
reached for comment.
In 1977-78 Tanner took the job 
of director for fiscal management 
in SUPA, the position she held 
until leaving CMU in 1988. She 
had previously been assistant di­
rector for fiscal management.
Tanner claims in the complaint 
that in 1980 she was offered the 
job of assistant dean in H&SS 
and that after accepting the posi­
tion she was told that it was no 
longer available.
In 1981 Brian Berry became 
dean of SUPA. According to the 
complaint, when he met with 
CMU’s senior vice president and 
provost, Richard Van Horn, “Van 
Horn told Dean Berry to termi­
nate Ms. Tanner because her pres­
ence made President Cyert un­
comfortable.” Berry, now a pro­
fessor at the University of Texas 
at Dallas, declined to comment.
CMU’s answer denies these as­
sertions as well.
Tanner’s complaint claims that 
in 1981 she applied for the job of 
budget director and was not in­
terviewed. The complaint claims 
that she was qualified for the job, 
although CMU’s answer denies 
that assertion.
CMU’s answer also denies an 
allegation that “Sometime in the 
period1981-1985, President Cyert 
submitted lists of staff employees 
to academic deans, including Ms.
Tanner, who should be dismissed 
because the job market was soft 
and replacements would have 
lower salaries.”
In 1986, Alfred Blumstein be­
came dean of SUPA and hired 
Harold Miller as associate dean. 
Both parties agree that before 
Miller was hired, Tanner asked 
Blumstein to give her the title of 
assistant dean. Blumstein turned 
down the request. Tanner’s com­
plaint says the title of assistant 
dean more closely matched her 
duties and responsibilities than 
the title of director for fiscal man­
agement, but CMU disagrees.
Blumstein said that Tanner was 
not considered for the job of asso­
ciate dean. “[Tanner] was never 
considered for anything higher 
than director of fiscal manage­
ment during my time [as dean of 
SUPA],” he said.
After Miller was hired, Tanner 
asked Blumstein to find her a job 
in the new Center for Economic 
Development. Blumstein refused.
Tanner’s complaint alleges that 
“Until June 1988, Ms. Tanner ... 
had received no information from 
any of her former supervisors that 
her performance was less than 
satisfactory.” CMU’s answer de­
nies that allegation.
Tanner was notified by Miller 
in September 1988 that she was
fired. Tanner’s complaint claims 
that in June “Miller advised Ms. 
Tanner that her performance was 
unsatisfactory.” CMU’s answer 
denies the allegation without fur­
ther explanation.
According to Tanner’s com­
plaint, in July 1988 professor Ben 
Fischer asked about other jobs for 
Tanner at CMU and was told “that 
the administration would not sup­
port Ms. Tanner’s continued em­
ployment at [CMU].” In its an­
swer, CMU said it did not have 
enough information to know if 
this statement was true.
In August 1988, Tanner applied 
for the job of assistant vice presi­
dent in the Academic Services 
Division and was subsequently 
told that the position had been 
withdrawn. Tanner’s complaint 
says that she interviewed for the 
job and was told during the inter­
view that she was qualified. CMU 
also denies this claim.
The complaint’s final assertion 
before addressing the counts 
against CMU is that Tanner “was 
replaced by Debra Raubenstauch 
[sic] who was approximately 30 
years of age and who had no expe­
rience in fiscal management.” 
CMU denies the assertion.
“Debra Raubenstrauch has 
been very effective in performing 
the job and I have been satisfied
with her performance,” said 
Blumstein. He also said that the 
decision to fire Tanner was “an 
internal decision based purely on 
performance.”
CMU officials involved in the 
case said that the settlement 
should not be taken as an indica­
tion that they believed Tanner’s 
allegations against Cyert or her 
accusations of discrimination.
“I personally recommended that 
the matter be settled,” DeForest 
said. “And I did it because I felt 
the issues relating to her perfor­
mance in her job at SUPA were 
unnecessarily causing divisions 
in SUPA that were counterpro­
ductive to the functioning of - 
SUPA. And that it was not be­
cause of the sexual advance. You 
must understand that there were 
other counts to this complaint.”
Brannick implied that the Uni­
versity took the age discrimina­
tion charge most seriously in de­
ciding to settle.
“I categorically disagree with 
[the] assessment that we thought 
the allegations may or may not be 
true.” Mehrabian, who made the 
final decision to settle, said, “I 
just did not think that this was an 
issue that I wanted to be dis­
cussed broadly and I didn’t think 
it was in the best interest of ei­
ther the University [or Tanner].”

begin their assimilation into the local

We expect it to be a huge success.” 
Associate Dean of H&SS Joseph Devine 
agreed. “We’ve got a very nice-sized pro­
gram for the fall semester,” he said. “Some 
students will be there for the spring, too.
“The level of excitement is certainly 
there,” he continued. “In fact, we will be

fall. We are also talking with students 
from other colleges across the country.”

gram, said, “It’s cool. I’m glad that I am 
getting the chance to go.”
Tudek said that one of the goals he has 
for his stay in France is to “perform 
outside the Center.”
“Since I’m studying styles of composi­
tion, I also want to be inspired to write 
while I am there,” he added.
While there, students will be living 
with families that have been hand-picked. 
“The biggest advantages are the
program’s location, close enough to Paris 
but not too close, and the fact that it is an 
established program, having been run 
by Stanford for some years,” said Devine. 
“The admissions office has said that pro­
spective freshman have also responded 
well” to the program.
“We hope to see the program grow in 
the future,” said Freed. “Possibly a pro­
gram in Germany, and one in Spain or 
Latin America.”

CMAP announces expansion
CMAP, from page 1
about CMAP.
Some feel that the CMAP students tend to segre­
gate themselves and do not truly flow into the 
mainstream of CMU.
“A lot of non -CMAP students are afraid that they 
are being cheated out of educational benefits and 
say that CMAP students segregate themselves. 
This is not true,” says H&SS freshman Carin 
Abnathy. “As far as segregation goes, if you are 
! presented with open arms you feel welcomed, but if 
! you see nothing but turned backs, you go elsewhere
¦ to seek comfort.”
“This is not an affirmative action program for 
recruitment of underrepresented groups. CMAP
does not pull strings to get blacks and Hispanics 
into this school. The group did not help us get 
admitted to this school.
“We compete on a level equal to or above the rest 
of the University,” says Trinette Chandler, a fresh­
man technical writing major.
CMAP is pleased with the additional resources it 
was granted to include Hispanics in the program.
“Trying to recruit Hispanics to attend CMU is 
important since the Hispanic population is the 
fastest growing minority in the country,” said Hill.
She continued, “We’re not really changing our 
program by including Hispanics in the program. 
We’re just doing more to bring in more students and 
help them with their needs.”

The five presidential candidates sit with moderator Mark Kamlet (third from left) at last Monday's debate.Five run for student 
government president
PRESIDENT, from page 1
Chair Chris Neighbor, the person best for student 
government president is someone who “can talk to 
people easily, especially people they work closely 
with, and express themselves well.” In addition, a 
president must not only have a lot of good ideas, but 
be able to implement the ideas. Neighbor cited Rao 
and Mark Mittelhauser as good examples.
“They both pursued their ideas. For example, Rao 
wanted a fifth-year scholar program, so he pursued 
and implemented it.” The president must also be 
able to work well with the Senate, said Neighbor.
According to Neighbor, “there is no set formula 
for what background experience is most important. 
Student Senators, resident assistants, and Greeks 
have all been elected.”
He said what is important is “how they apply 
themselves while in the position.” Neighbor be­
lieves that the best approach is “to have a few big 
ideas, rather than a lot of smaller ones. It is 
important candidates to have goals, and carry 
them out while in office.”
“All of this year’s candidates are exceptional,” 
said Neighbor. “The campus has a hard decision to 
make.” Neighbor believes that the person who 
campaigns the hardest and gets their message out 
will win the election.
There will be a happy hour today at 6:30 pm in 
the Tartan Lounge to allow students to talk to 
candidates in an informal setting.
In addition, the debate will be re-broadcast by 
WRCT tomorrow at 8 pm.
Candidates debate issues, 
answer questions in PH 100
The following is an excerpt from 
last Monday’s presidential debate.
Panelist and WRCT General 
Manager Kevin Goldsmith: 
Summarize the most important 
issue on your platform.... The sec­
ond part of my question ... is a 
three-choice multiple choice. 
Would you support a) increasing, 
b) keeping the same, or c) reduc­
ing funding of Greek events and 
council?
Dean: The president’s term is 
approximately 140 days. I was an 
intern on Capitol Hill this sum­
mer and I was lucky enough to be 
there when Congressman 
Hinckley, who I was working for, 
finally resolved an issue which he 
had been working on for so long 
and I’ve seen Kishore work all 
year on the fifth-year scholar pro­
gram. So I think it’s very impor­
tant to limit your long term goals. 
My long term goal would be to 
work, especially with CFA, on 
gettingmore openness within tak­
ing classes outside your major, 
like letting engineers take classes 
in the arts. I would increase Greek 
funding, except in cases where 
the money is going to charity, 
because that’s kind of taking the 
activities fee and handing it to a 
charity. Other than that, I think 
we should fund Greek rush and I 
believe I did vote for that when it 
came to a question.
Ewedosh: I think that the most 
important issue in my campaign 
platform is to increase the ac­
countability of Student Govern­
ment to students. I think that 
Student Government should have 
to start talking to students, that
Student Government should have 
to take the active role rather than 
the passive one that it has in the 
past. I think that we should fund 
whatever we need to-fund to en­
hance the quality of student life. 
So do I think that that means we 
need to do more Greek funding? 
Yes, I do. But I think that we also 
need to be careful not to have a 
double standard when it comes to 
funding things in terms of rules 
and things like that. I think that 
we have to be careful that if we’re 
going to set a rule about charity 
and money is not going to go to 
certain things, that that rule is 
applied evenly across the board. I 
think that it should be something 
that we think about and that stu­
dent government makes an issue 
and makes a decision on once and 
for all and not just change the 
policy back and forth year to year.
Gesmond: I would like to stress 
very clearly that my platform is to 
let the sentiment of student ac­
tion be the mechanism through 
which students can actively in­
duce positive change on this cam­
pus. All of the activities and 
projects I propose deal with ideas 
which have been expressed by 
students, and I think that stu­
dents should be heard, and that 
their yearnings should be satis­
fied. Those are the kinds of 
changes I seek to make. When it 
comes to giving money to Greeks 
for whatever activities they de­
sire to have, whether they be for 
the public or not, they are benefit­
ing that Greek organization. They 
are also benefiting the campus 
community and even outside of
our campus community. I think 
Greek funding is necessary, I 
would plan to increase it, but I 
would demand a precedent to be 
set. As Mike said, if it’s good for 
one Greek organization, it is good 
for another.
Moore: I want to try to bring 
the campus together, bring vari­
ous colleges together, bring the 
students, faculty, and adminis­
tration together. In answer to 
the Greek funding question, it’s 
a very complex issue. There are 
times when Greeks have defi­
nitely deserved funding and they 
haven’t gotten it. There are other 
times they asked for funding 
when I really don’t think it should 
have been handed out. I was 
against the funding of Greek Sing 
this year, basically because it all 
went to charity. The Greeks were 
very proud of gettingmore money 
this year than they’ve ever got­
ten before, and I don’t think that 
the people who realized that this 
was the first year they were 
funded were very surprised to 
hear that. A lot of the money that 
they got this year came directly 
from Senate. But there are other 
events which really do deserve 
funding.
Shin: My answer to your first 
question is eight words: increase 
student involvement and act on 
student concerns. In answer to 
your second question, I guess it 
depends on whether the event 
enhances students’ life on cam­
pus. If it does, we should. If it 
doesn’t, we shouldn’t.

have getting into extra- 
departmental classes. Other 
areas I view as vital and will work 
toward Improvement and 
expansion of include: dining 
services, the recycling program, 
and health services. I will also 
seek suggestions from students 
for additional improvements of 
university life.

As a presidential candidate, several 
issues need to be addressed — a 
broad range of Issues that can be 
summed up in two words... Student 
Action. Students must realize that 
there is no better way to improve 
campus life than getting involved. I 
propose an organized effortto affect 
change. Let Student Action be the 
mechanism by which organization 
can occur. Spreading the sentiment 
of student action could serve 
somewhat as a catalyst for further 
activity. I propose the development 
of a “Student Action Center," the 
formation of a university television 
network and the Improvement of 
the Student Health Center.

The student president has two 
major roles. First off, he acts as a 
leader in the Student Senate. I 
Intend to play a much more active 
role here than in the past years. 
Secondly, the president acts as 
the primary liaison between the 
students and the administration.
I feel that it is very important to 
maintain a working relationship 
between the students, 
administrators, and faculty. In 
order to further these goals, I 
Intend to encourage more student 
participation with the 
administration and faculty, aswell 
as faculty and administation 
participation in student 
organizations.

The Tartan usually endorses a 
candidate for Student Govern­
ment President, but this year we’re 
not.
Of the five candidates, one is a 
former Tartan news editor, and 
one is a current staffwriter. It’s 
impossible for us to make an en­
dorsement that would be com­
pletely objective.
The most we can do is inform the 
students. On pages 1 and 5 of this 
issue, we’ve provided news cover­
age that includes 100-word 
statements and resumes from each 
candidate, and an excerpt from 
last Monday’s presidential debate.

For several semesters, Student 
Senate, bombarded with accusa­
tions of laziness and apathy, has 
been suffering from an image 
problem.
At Wednesday’s meeting, Sen­
ate responded by initiating dis­
cussion on the possibility of 
amending three articles of the 
Student Government constitution.
Granted, the proposed changes 
would not revolutionize student 
government at CMU; they would 
simplify the constitution. But they 
would be a step in the right direc­
tion of eliminating some of the red 
tape that often stalls Senate ac­
tion.
Six Senators left the meeting in 
the middle of the discussion: 
sophomores Tatsuhiro Ikeda, 
Matthew Mueller, seniors Paul 
Moran, Phil Meek, Brad Wyatt, 
and masters student Tony Chien 
all left the meeting during the 
discussion on the constitution.
Because a two-thirds majority 
is necessary to pass the proposed 
amendments, Senate was not able 
to yote on the amendments to the 
constitution. There are 29 Sena­
tors; 21 were at the meeting when 
it started. Fifteen remained — 
not enough for a vote.
Instead of voting on the proposed 
changes, the discussion had to be 
tabled until this Wednesday’s 
meeting, the last Senate meeting 
of the year.
Senate, faced with the chance to 
make a positive change, ran in the 
other direction.
Senate Rules Committee Chair 
Stewart Barnes said the discus­
sion became very “annoying” and
There are other places you can 
turn as well to learn about the 
candidates. Tonight, Student 
Senate is sponsoring a happy hour 
in the Tartan Lounge from 6:30 to 
8 pm. The happy hour is designed 
to give students a chance to meet 
with the candidates for president 
and Senate.
Also tomorrow night, WRCT 
(88.3 FM) will rebroadcast the 
presidential debate, which in­
cludes the candidates’ platforms 
and responses to panelist and 
audience questions.
Take advantage of these oppor­
tunities to guide your decision.
eC duee3l unueov
downtrodden with a lot of 
“nitpicking.’’About two hours of 
discussion remained until a vote 
could have been held, said Barnes.
So what? Being willing to argue 
through an issue is part of the 
basic job description for a Senator. 
Even worse, last week’s events 
seem to indicate that Senate is so 
poorly run that simple changes 
which would help that problem 
can’t be made.
We think poor timing, a lack of 
commitment on the individual 
Senators’ parts, and Senate’s re­
fusal to address the proposed 
changes earlier in the semester 
are the culprits.
Barnes drafted the proposal in 
February, when it was ready for 
Senate’s consideration. Instead, 
the proposal was tabled meeting 
after meeting. It finally came up 
for discussion Wednesday, which 
happened to be the night before 
Carnival and the second to the 
last meeting of the year. Meek 
said he “had Carnival stuff to do,” 
and Ikeda left partly because he 
“wanted to work on booth.”
Sure, people were probably get­
ting antsy, but being a Senator 
requires a little creative schedul­
ing from time to time — it does for 
any student. Any Senator who 
can’t sit still for a couple of more 
hours to make some decent 
changes has no business occupy­
ing a seat that a more committed, 
responsible person could fill.
Come Wednesday, we want to 
see enough Senators at the meet- 
ingto hold a vote. Ifnot, Thursday 
is the students’ chance to make a 
change.

After we sent our reporters 
around the Midway this weekend 
to find out what Carnival goers 
thdught of Spring Carnival this 
year, we decided to make our own 
evaluation as well.
Even with the negative contri­
butions from Mother Nature that 
somewhat marred Midway fun, 
the Carnival and Sweepstakes 
committees, as well as all the 
student organizations that par­
ticipated, helped create a suc­
cessful weekend.
But we do have some gripes. 
WRCT seriously interfered with 
the staging of d’Artegan: a re­
quiem, the show put on Thursday, 
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday 
nights in the Skibo Ballroom by 
Scotch ‘N’ Soda. WRCT’s loud 
music blaring from its truck at the 
top of the Midway, right outside 
the Ballroom, was sometimes ap­
propriate, but for the most part, it 
was downright obnoxious.
It became rude when the music 
continued blasting throughout the 
first three nights of d’Artegan, 
even when they were asked to
turn it down.
The 33 organizations that put 
up booths this year provided 
genuine fun and competition. And 
even though the funnel cakes were 
greasier than in years past, A Phi 
0 provided good concession ser­
vices at good prices.
Moving out to the buggy course, 
fans in the Chute and on the hills 
were able to take in two exciting 
days of races this year.
By cutting down times in be­
tween heats, the Sweepstakes 
committee eliminated some of the 
restlessness that usually accom­
panies Race Day. And safety 
measures were also intact, as 
buggy drivers survived spills in 
the Chute.
However, the Sweepstakes com­
mittee goofed when it unexpect­
edly cancelled the alumni heats 
Saturday morning. Several people 
were caught off guard by this un­
popular decision.
All in all, Carnival wasasuccess. 
The weather was disappointing, 
but most of the elements that could 
be controlled were handled well.

Senate P.R. Chair urges 
students to vote
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor,
In just two days, the 
Student Government 
will hold its elections.
This past semester the 
voter turnout was less 
than five percent. Considering that the 
Student Government allocates just less 
than $700,000 of student money in a 
year, and serves as the voice of the stu­
dent body on a wide range of issues, a 
less than five percent voter turnout can­
not be acceptable. Perhaps this apathy 
stems from a lack of understanding of 
the Student Government.
On behalf of the Student Senate I would 
like to take this opportunity to explain 
what the Senate does. The Student Sen­
ate and the Student Government presi­
dent make up the Student Government 
of Carnegie Mellon. The duties of the 
Senate include allocation of the Student 
Activities Fee, advocacy of student in­
volvement in university decision-making 
and the resolution of student problems. 
The duties of the president include cre­
ation of beneficial student programs, 
working alongside the administration to 
see that CMU policy benefits the student 
body, and appointment of special com­
mittees.
With the ability to choose what orga­
nizations get campus support and which 
aspects of CMU need to be changed, you 
can see how such a body can direct cam­
pus life. And if this governmental body 
represents less than five percent of the 
University, you can see how the campus 
could be misrepresented and that power 
abused.
But now is a good time to change. The 
Student Government Elections are on 
Wednesday and Thursday of this week. 
If you come to the Tartan Lounge in 
Skibo between 6:30 and 8 pm, you can 
meet the candidates for the presidency 
and the Senate (and get free pizza). Dis­
cuss those topics that are important to 
you and find out what direction they 
have for Carnegie Mellon. Then listen to 
the Presidential Debate, which will be 
re-broadcast by WRCT 88.3 FM at 8 pm 
on Tuesday night. In this way you can 
make an informed decision about who 
can represent your concerns. And then 
vote.
If you find that you could do a more 
competent job than the candidates that 
you meet, then start a write-in cam­
paign.
I became a Senator with around thirty 
votes, if that gives you an estimate of 
what it takes to become an involved 
member of your community. All I ask is 
for you to vote. It’s painless, trust me.
The Senate office is Tartan Loft num­
ber one in Skibo. So stop by or give us a 
call at x2115.

After seeing the en­
ticing title of Kevin 
Barney’s concert re­
view in The Tartan 
[“Tommy Conwell and
Mosque,” 4/15], I was hoping some social 
and historic commentary about the hall’s 
fate would be included. Unfortunately, I 
will never know because I put on the 
brakes halfway through the first para­
graph.
I can see how all fraternal organiza­
tions composed primarily of middle-aged, 
white males may seem alike to a college 
student, but let me assure you, the Syria 
Mosque is NOT owned by the Knights of 
Columbus, as Mr. Barney stated. It is 
owned by the Shriners, part of the fra­
ternal order of the Free and Accepted 
Masons. The Shriners do a tremendous 
amount of charitable work to support 
hospitals for crippled and burned chil­
dren. The Knights of Columbus is a fra­
ternal order of Roman Catholic men. It 
also contributes to charitable and edu­
cational projects, but is primarily a re­
ligious organization.
A quick look through any of the local 
newspapers from the past two weeks 
should have given Mr. Barney a clue as 
to who is selling the Mosque. Perhaps we 
should all be grateful that the Raccoon 
Lodge was not credited with ownership.
Let me presume to advise any and all 
columnists: “research” is not a four-letter 
word. You have several libraries on 
campus overflowing with people who 
would be happy to assist you in getting 
any information you might need.

PC controversy deserves 
discussion, clarification
Letter to 
the Editor
on
teller la lho Edllor ThoT»run Skibo IUII to
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I am writing in re­
sponse to Jonathan 
Levy’s column last 
week [“Liberals fight 
idea of PC,” 4/15] be­
cause it is exemplary of the sorts of con­
fusions surrounding the so-called “po­
litical correctness” controversy. I’d like 
to redress the misconception that the 
challenges to universities currently be­
ing demonized by the “witch hunt” stories 
are somehow the product of liberalism 
rather than inherently inimical to it. 
What these kinds of discussions need, 
but cannot conceive, is a distinction be­
tween liberalism and something like 
“leftism” that would begin to clarify, 
rather than elide, their differences. Levy 
can hardly be blamed, I suppose, for 
passing along the usual misunderstand­
ings since he merely reiterates the same 
kinds of confusions repeated by everyone 
and their brother and reinforced by school 
and the mainstream media. However, 
Levy should know better than to accept 
what he reads in the commercial press as 
fact.
First, we should try very briefly to 
define the term “liberalism” since Levy 
relies so heavily on it. The history of the 
word in its political sense is linked to the 
social development of early nineteenth 
century Europe and the rise of laissez- 
faire capitalism which forms so much of 
the basis of our society. “Liberalism,” 
then as now, generally assumes the 
Enlightenment’s ideas about universal 
human equality and describes any policy 
that favors the freedom — hence the 
name — of the individual from interfer-
George Thorogood tear down the Syria ence by the state. Horatio Alger and
similar rags-to-riches stories are re­
peated in liberal societies because they 
vindicate its world view with the idea 
that social differences are the result of 
individual will. In its historical context, 
this vision effectively justified the private 
accumulation of property and wealth and 
so expressed the interests of the newly 
emergent capitalist class, as it still does 
today.
But at the same time liberalism advo­
cated curtailing the power of the state, it 
also agreed some form of state institution 
was necessary, mostly for the protection 
of the property and wealth that the in­
dividual had accumulated. Thus a “lib­
eral” debate generally revolves around 
how much or how little state interference 
is necessary in any given situation, which
I would suggest describes the basic rou­
tine of our lawmakers as well as the 
general form of mainstream political 
discussion in the U.S. In other words, if 
we could grasp the term in its proper 
history, we could understand that 
“liberalism” doesn’t just name one par­
ticular camp, but the whole framework 
within which politics are predominantly 
understood in late twentieth century 
America, whether by Democrat or Re­
publican, “Conservative” or “Liberal.” 
The putative differences between these 
positions is simply a matter of degrees of 
state regulation over private affairs — 
Conservatives and Republicans favoring 
less, Democrats or “Liberals” generally 
favoring more. Thus liberalism has more 
to do with the old rather than “the new 
orthodoxy.” That someone who has 
reached the level in higher education of 
Jonathan Levy still confuses “liberalism” 
with “the left” attests to the effectiveness 
of the educational and media apparatuses 
in this country, which both have an in­
terest in restricting political options so 
narrowly. On the other hand, the fact 
that less than half the eligible voters in 
the U.S. bother to participate in presi­
dential elections would seem to indicate 
an awareness that the choice is rather 
like the difference between Coke and 
Pepsi.
Remembering the history of the term 
is helpful because, true to its origins, 
mainstream liberal politics, of either the 
Republican or Democratic stripe, still 
assume the fundamental equality of all 
individuals before the law and within 
the institutions of the state which are 
assumed to be neutral. Within the logic 
of this framework, questions about the 
structure of the economy, the state or its 
institutions systematically distributing 
power unequally accordingto factors such 
as race, class, gender, or sexuality are 
literally unthinkable and so can never be 
uttered, except to dismiss them. This 
helps explain the anxiety in Time, one of 
the leading organs of liberal thought in 
the U.S., as expressed in the self-evi- 
dently scandalous summary of its treat­
ment of the subject, “A troubling number 
of teachers regard America’s history as 
racist, sexist, and classist,” a story which 
ran on April 1,1991. It also may help to 
explain, for example, one of Levy’s past 
columns [“Women must play lead role in 
battling sexism,” 3/18], that seems to see 
sexism as the result of the individual’s 
choice either to be victimized or not, 
rather than as a property of a whole 
social structure which exceeds any 
individual’s will. Until recently, those 
who have raised questions about sys-

Bush must follow through
Despite the fact that it has its flaws, 
I am encouraged by Bush’s proposal. 
I am also surprised.
Jonathan Levy
I can hardly believe I’m about 
to write this, but George Bush 
may have found himself a do­
mestic policy worthy of the his­
tory books.
On Thursday, he announced a 
plan, called “America 2000” in 
reference to the target date for its 
six goals to be met, which would 
try to revitalize the U.S. public 
education system.
According to the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, the goals, developed 
after a September 1989 “educa­
tion summit” between Bush and 
the nation’s governors, are “to 
make all adults literate, to in­
crease the high school graduation 
rate to 90 percent, to make U.S. 
students first in the world in math 
and science, to have all children 
ready to learn when they enter 
school, to eliminate drugs and 
violence from schools, and to have 
students prove their competency 
in basic skills in grades four, eight 
and 12.”
Towards these ends, Bush pro­
poses, among other things, to 
implement nationwide exams in 
the grades mentioned, covering 
English, math, science, history, 
and geography; to encourage col­
lege admissions offices and em­
ployers to use the exams in choos­
ing students and new employees; 
to work with businesses to raise 
money for education; to give par­
ents opportunities to choose which 
schools their children will attend
—possibly even helping them pay 
for private schools; and to give $1 
million federal grants to estab­
lish one “model school” in each of 
the nation’s 435 congressional 
districts and two others in each 
state.
Despite the fact that it has its 
flaws, I am encouraged by Bush’s 
proposal. I am also surprised. Like 
the rest of America, I saw him 
promise in his 1988 election cam­
paign to become the “education 
President,” but I had assumed 
that like his “no new taxes” vow it 
was a promise he had no inten­
tion of keeping.
I hope that assumption has been 
proven wrong, but I wouldn’t bet 
on it yet. There is a big difference 
between making grand plans and 
carrying them out. Bush, who has 
never proven that he can lead the 
country in anything other than a 
short war, will be tested when the 
American public discovers, yet 
again, that big plans come with 
big price tags.
Bush is apparently already try­
ing to address taxpayers’ fears, 
but he is doing it wrong.
His plan calls for very little 
federal spending, and he was 
quoted in the Post-Gazette as 
saying “Let’s stop trying to mea­
sure progress in terms of money 
spent. Dollar bills don’t educate 
children.”
He is right that money alone 
cannot solve the nation’s prob­
lems. But he is wrong in implying 
that the U.S. educational system 
can be repaired cheaply. If Bush’s 
plan is to work, it will require 
enough courage to spend the 
money to do it right. Whether 
Bush has that courage is ques­
tionable.
The real shame if the idea of 
education reform were to die on 
the planning table would be that 
Bush might be one of the few 
Presidents who could pull it off.
One of the biggest barriers to 
improvements in education is that 
they require a lot of money up 
front, while most of the payoffs of 
a better educated country come 
when the students have grown 
up, after the elected officials who 
implemented the programs have 
left office. Since voters have a 
tendency to be shortsighted, it is 
near political suicide for those 
officials to propose big spending 
programs whose benefits come 
long after the next election.
Bush may be one of the few 
presidents who could beat this 
flaw in the system. Barring major 
errors in the next 19 months, Bush 
should have little trouble turning 
his Persian Gulf success into a 
comfortable re-election victory. If 
he has the nerve to take the 
gamble and the leadership ability
HERBLOCK’S CARTOON
to pull it off, he should be able to 
put expensive education reforms 
into place and still preserve that 
victory.
The question is whether he has 
that nerve and ability. Past expe­
rience would suggest that he does 
not. But there can be a first time
for everything and Bush has 
shown signs of being a different 
President since the beginning of 
the Gulf crisis.

Stupidity and gullibility lead to misunderstanding
Kevin Barney
Stupidity. We’ve all engaged in it at 
one time or another. Ask anyone who 
knows me about my playing basketball 
in the hospital. Ask my roommate about 
playing in other people’s dirty laundry. 
Ask my other roommate about sneaking 
into the new dorm looking for Hitler’s 
brain, which was rumored to be alive and 
well. Come to one of our parties and see 
how stupid we can get.
But there are people out there who are 
too stupid for anyone’s good. Take for 
instance the problems that Eric Miller is 
running into.
Miller is the owner of a bottling com­
pany called the Brooklyn Bottling Co. 
Last year they came out with a new soda
called Tropical Fantasy. Priced extremely 
low — forty-nine cents for 20 ounces — 
this soda soon became the number-one 
seller in some of the stores in the New 
York area.
Enter the stupidity. Someone started 
distributing leaflets saying that minori­
ties should stay away from Tropical 
Fantasy. The leaflet went on to say that 
the soda was created by the KKK and 
that it contained “stimulants to sterilize 
the black man.”
The KKKs response was entirely in­
telligent. “We’re not in the bottling 
business,” said James Farrands, the 
Imperial Wizard — are these guys 
Dungeons & Dragons losers who have 
grown up? — of the largest Klan organi­
zation in the country.
Enter more stupidity. Wait a second, 
more stupidity after the KKK? Yes, more 
stupidity. People are believing the leaf­

lets. Delivery trucks have been hit with 
rocks, customers have been swinging 
bats at distributors.
Butwait. How can therebe all this stupidity 
without the government becoming involved? 
But the government/ias become involved. No, 
it hasn’t sent Dan Quayle down to survey the 
situation. The FDA has entered into the 
disarray with an investigation of its own 
Whichisn’tthat stupid. Hell, if s probably the 
smartest thing that’s happened since this
has started.
What the hell is going on? One stupid 
person, or perhaps a bunch of stupid people, 
probably sat around one evening and 
starting thinking of ways to increase their 
stupid factor —the level of stupidity at 
which a person functions. This person or 
group of people decided to ruin Miller’s 
business, but in order to do this success­
fully these people would need help from 
the stupid public. People that would be­
lieve everything they read. Now that is 
stupid.
If a person can’t tell the difference be­
tween fact and fiction, then there’s a 
problem.
If a group of people start to have this 
difficulty, then this problem will start to 
spread, affecting everybody.
Can you imagine what this country 
would be like if everyone believed what 
they read? What would happen if the 
blacks read KKK literature? What would 
happen if members of the Women’s Cen­
ter read some of the graffiti in certain 
bathrooms?
At least we wouldn’t have to worry 
about the credibility of such authors as 
Kitty Kelley and Julia Phillips.

‘Doctored’ transcript fuels battle
Richard Cohen
Washington is a pretty humor­
less town, so more’s the pity when 
two of its wittiest men feud. I am 
talking about me and Senator 
Alan Simpson (R-Wyoming). The 
Republican whip takes me to task 
for accepting at face value an 
Iraqi-provided transcript of a 
meeting Simpson and four other 
senators had with Saddam 
Hussein last April. As with Pete 
Arnett before me, Simpson says 
I’ve been duped.
Well, it has happened — but 
not this time. In a letter to The 
Washington Post, Simpson says 
that the transcript was doctored. 
He says that the 15 pages in no 
way reflect all that was said in 
over three hours with Saddam 
Hussein.
He says that he and his col­
leagues discussed many issues 
with the Iraqi strongman — no 
doubt in Humphrey Bogartish 
tones — and that he, for one, 
cannot be accused of “commiser­
ating” with Saddam, as I wrote. 
Judge for yourself.
“I believe your problem is with 
the Western media, not with the 
U.S. government, because you are 
isolated from the media and the 
press,” Simpson told Saddam ac­
cording to the transcript. “The 
press is spoiled and conceited. All 
the journalists consider them­
selves brilliant political scientists. 
They do not want to see anything 
succeeding or achieving its objec­
tives. My advice is that you allow 
those bastards to come here and 
see things for themselves.”
Possibly thanks to Simpson — 
although I doubt it — this par­
ticular “bastard” and other jour­
It’s worth noting that Simpson does not 
deny the relevant part of the transcript.
nalists were allowed to visit Iraq. 
We found it no fun assignment. 
One month before Simpson had 
gone to Baghdad, Saddam had 
hanged a British journalist on 
charges of spying for Israel.
An outraged Simpson says his 
delegation protested. Neverthe­
less, Simpson ought to try work­
ing in a place where the phones 
are tapped, hotel rooms bugged 
and, on account of the secret po­
lice, the lyric “You’ll never walk 
alone” takes on a whole new 
meaning.
It’s worth noting that Simpson 
does not deny the relevant part of 
the transcript.
Nor did he do so last Septem­
ber when The Wall Street Journal 
asked about it. “In the interview 
yesterday, Senator Simpson con­
firmed its accuracy,” the Journal 
said.
It’s also worth noting that 
Simpson’s complaint about accu­
racy echoes what the former am­
bassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, 
told the Senate last month: A 
transcript of her meeting with 
Saddam had been doctored.
Anytime is a good time to re­
view that assertion — and 
Simpson’s letter provides just the 
opportunity.
Like Simpson, the State De­
partment initially did not dispute

Bureaucracy, budget should not control CMDS
They say that food on college campuses 
little like food in the army* Regard- 
of how good or bad it is, everyone 
Ices to bitch about it. It’s sort of a 
irmless pastime, like playing chess or 
oking at your reflection in the windows 
m pass on the street.
Well, thanks to the short war, I’ve 
»ver been in the army. But I have been 
iting Carnegie Mellon Dining Service 
for just about (gulp) four years now, 
Qd I think I’m pretty experienced at 
,mplaining.
For instance, one thing that’s pissed 
off recently is the diet Coke nozzle on 
ie one side of Highlander. It’s been 
lurting foam and fizz for almost two 
eeks now, so I always have to go to the 
her line to get a drink. Doesn’t anybody 
these stupid things?
Idle coniplaints aside, though, CMDS 
as a significant, systemic problem: As a 
istomer, I am unable to respond to poor 
lality by taking my business elsewhere, 
;cause I’ve paid my pretty much non-
Howdy Pierce
refundable money long ago.
As a result, there’s little incentive for 
CMDS to care what I think about their 
service and their products.
Take a look at the real world for a 
minute. Suppose I go out to eat at an off- 
campus restaurant each night. (Yeah, 
right. Suppose I win the lottery.) Now, if 
one of my favorite restaurants — say, a 
pizza place—began offering a restricted 
menu with smaller portions, I’d stop 
going. If a lot of other customers were 
disgruntled as well, the pizza restaurant 
would have to improve quality, enlarge 
portions (equivalently, decrease prices), 
or go out of business.
The free market would be working for 
me, the customer.
But if MorePizza starts doing the same 
thing, who cares? Some students may just 
put up with the poorer quality, eat the 
smaller portions, and complain to their 
friends. Others, who are perhaps more 
upset, may walk across the Cut to Salads 
Plus. Either way, CMDS gets our money.
In fact, other than a vague mission to 
meet student dining needs, there’s no 
real reason for Dining Service to worry 
about keepingus happy. Remember, next 
year’s meal service contract is along way
As a customer, I am unable to respond to poor quality by taking my 
business elsewhere, because I’ve paid my pretty much non-refund- 
able money long ago.
off. About a fourth of us are graduating 
before then anyway, while another fourth 
of next year’s customer base is required 
by University regulations to purchase at 
least 15 meals a week. Besides, avoiding 
Dining Service altogether is a pretty big 
inconvenience if you live on campus; most 
of us, myself included, would rather just 
eat CMDS food and complain for another 
year than hike to Rax on Centre Avenue.
Now, I’ve met with CMDS Director 
James Gurley on a number of occasions. 
In all fairness, he sincerely wants to give 
students the best quality he can. But at 
the same time, he’s most worried about 
balancing his budget while keeping 
contract prices reasonably low.
Furthermore, Gurley gets pretty poor 
feedback from students. There are those 
Comment Tables (yeah, right), and then 
there is Student Dormitory Council’s Food 
Committee, which is perhaps the most 
worthless advisory board at this school.
(Know anybody on it? Ever talk to them 
just to hear the CMDS party line recited 
back at you? Heck, if you live off campus, 
like me, you’re not even represented!)
CMDS should be reorganized into six 
nearly-autonomous Dining Units 
(Highlander, Tartan Grill, Salads Plus, 
MorePizza, Morewood Gardens, and the 
lunch carts), each with its own manager. 
Each unit’s management should be inde­
pendently responsible for setting prices 
and menus and maintaining a budget, 
although all the managers would ulti­
mately report to Gurley. And CMDS 
should establish cash incentives for the 
management and employees of units that 
do well — where doing well is defined as 
attracting the most customers.
In short, let’s introduce some competi­
tion into CMDS. That way, it would 
make a difference whenMorePizza starts 
serving crap, because its manager would 
be at fault. Better, he or she would be
able to do something fast when sales fell 
off, instead of waiting for CMDS’s larger 
bureaucracy to respond.
Sure, there are some points to this 
plan that need to be ironed out. For 
instance, who handles ordering? (I’d 
recommend that be handled centrally, 
with individual units placing orders to 
CMDS which would then contact ven­
dors; we want to maintain the current 
economy of scale as much as possible.)
But as a general direction, this com­
petition idea makes some sense. Cer­
tainly the plan is good enough for Steve 
Schillo, the administrator whose job it is 
to renew Marriott’s consulting contract 
for dining service, to get together with 
Gurley and take a long look at it.
Howdy Pierce is a senior double-major­
ing in mathematics and professional 
writing. He’s looking forward to eating

Author, sources lack credibility, reek of fabrication
George F. Will
Kitty Kelley, who battens like a

oods. Her remunerative work in 
ie sewers of journalism exploits 
le fact that public figures can be 
•cklessly written about with 
apunity. To prevent a “chilling 
Feet” on public discourse, courts 
ave made it almost prohibitively 
ifficult for public figures to de- 
nd themselves from even reck- 
ss and malicious disregard for 
ie truth. Many public figures 
ive had this experience: An ab- 
lrd, injurious and easily refut- 
ble rumor is reported as fact, 
id the publisher says, “Well, we 
mrately report rumors.” Nancy 
eagan is today’s victim.
For the record, I, unlike Kelley, 
lowNancy Reagan. Many people, 
ho admire her as I do, refused to 
operate withKelley, knowing her 
be the journalistic sociopath that 
:r new book shows her to be. So 
lost of her “sources,” if they exist, 
re hostile to her subject.
If one must have enemies, may 
leir malice, crudeness, mendac- 
)'and ignorance be as patent as 
elley’s. No one whose opinion 
atters to a grown-up can read a 
ige of Kelley’s book without 
sgust at her technique. Here is 
sample, concerning Nancy in 
ie 1940s:
u0ne man Nancy saw on a 
gular basis was Dr. DanielRuge, 
r father’s senior assistant at 
issavant Hospital, who would 
day become Ronald Reagan’s 
lute House physician. ‘He would
call me and ask me to cover for 
him,’ said a resident at Passavant 
at the time. ‘Dan would say, “I’m 
going to take Nancy over to the 
Esquire Theater,” and he’d sneak 
out for a couple of hours while I 
covered the house. What he did 
with her at that theater I don’t 
know. He was too much of a 
gentleman ever to tell me, but 
that was a thing that was hot and 
heavy in 1945 for at least three 
months that I knew about.’ 
“Years later, Dr. Ruge denied 
any romantic involvement with 
Nancy Davis, saying, ‘I think 
someone is getting me confused 
with Clark Gable.’
“A few days before Nancy left 
for New York she ran into two 
male friends of her parents and 
shocked the two married men by 
her method of saying goodbye.
“ ‘Ben and I were walking down 
E ast Lake Shore Drive by the Drake 
Hotel,’ said one of the men. ‘We had 
just finished lunch when we saw 
Nancy, who came running over to 
us. She said she was leaving town 
and just wanted to say goodbye. 
She grabbed me first, kissed me 
hard on the lips and plunged her 
tongue down my throat. Then she 
thrust herself at Ben and did the 
same thing to him.’ ”
This tale involves four men. 
Only one, Dr. Ruge, is identified. 
He scoffs at inane innuendoes like 
the one — what did they do at the 
theater? — of the “resident at 
Passavant.” Why is the resident 
not identified? Why are “Ben” and 
his talkative friend not identified? 
Could it be that Kelley does not 
want her “facts” checked with her 
“sources?”

If one must have enemies, may their malice, crudeness, 
mendacity and ignorance be as patent as Kelley's. No 
one whose opinion matters to a grown-up can read a 
page of Kelley’s book without disgust at her technique.
How many decades after the 
fact—four?—did Ben’s talkative 
friend talk, and to whom, con­
cerning his vivid memories about 
his throat and Nancy’s tongue? 
This episode, like much of the 
book, reeks of fabrication.
Barbara Bush, pouncing on a 
Kelley falsehood concerning a gift 
to Nancy Reagan, denounces the 
book as “trash and fiction” and 
endorses the description of it as 
“scummy.” Even Kelley’s ac­
knowledgments are absurd. In a 
list of “editors, writers and re­
porters” who “took the time to 
answer questions and share their 
stories” — whatever that means 
— there appears the name of the 
man who runs the mail room in 
Time magazine’s Washington 
bureau. The list of people who she 
says helped her is long.
There is a political element to 
some of the attention this book 
has received. Kelley, who has a 
cash register behindher forehead, 
is not complicated enough to have 
political motives. The same can­
not be said of TheNew York Times, 
which last Sunday presented a 
front-page story passively re­
counting many of the book’s alle­
gations.
People who sell garbage present 
no mystery: The morals of the 
marketplace have many devotees.
But what causes so many buyers 
to take such delight in seeing fa­
mous people’s names besmirched?
Perhaps it has something to do 
with the prevalence of envy in a 
democratic society, the result of 
the egalitarian impulse gone ran­
cid. Envy is the only one of the
seven deadly sins that gives the 
sinner not even momentary plea­
sure. Pleasure comes later, from 
seeing prominent people brought 
as low as envious people perpetu­
ally feel. That pleasure will be de­
nied to readers of Kelley’s book, 
which is too unrelievedly tenden­
tious to do lasting injury. But brisk 
sales of the book testify at least in 
part to an avid suspension of dis­
belief by some people whose lives 
evidently are so arid they can only 
be irrigated by lurid gossip.
Today’s teen-agers — at least 
those who inhabit and filter 
through my house — have an apt 
response to people who take friv- 
olousthingsseriously. They say, 
“Get a life!” That is good advice 
for people eager to get this book.

following graduation. Approximately 75 Watson Fellows are 
selected every year, and receive grants ranging from $13,000 
to $18,000 for travel and study abroad during the year 
following their college graduation. Eligible students include 
H&SS students, and non-H&SS students with an H&SS 
double major or minor. Preliminary applications are due in 
early October of the senior year. Nominees are selected in 
late October, and are interviewed by the Foundation Director 
in January or February.

Administration’s pre-war policy deserves close scrutiny
ADMINISTRATION, from page 8
the transcript of the Glaspie meeting. It took more 
than half a year — and the conclusion of the war — 
for it to assert its falsity. But the Bush administra­
tion will provide no documentation.
Certain questions hang: Was Glaspie set up to be 
the fall person for the administration’s inept pre­
war policy or is someone lying?
It’s understandable that Simpson would attempt 
to do what the Bush administration has already 
done — and done successfully at that.
The administration’s policy towards Iraq pre­
ceding the invasion of Kuwait demands the closest 
scrutiny. After all, a war resulted and its horrible 
consequences are still with us. Yet the Senate, 
mostly brain-dead except when it comes to postur­
ing, has let the matter drop. The press, alas, has 
done no better.
The GOP’s congressional leadership, of which 
Simpson is a part, took its cue from the White 
House and was mostly supine in dealing with
The administration’s policy towards Iraq preceding the invasion of Kuwait demands the 
closest scrutiny. After all, a war resulted and its horrible consequences are still with 
us. Yet the Senate, mostly brain-dead except when it comes to posturing, has let the 
matter drop. The press, alas, has done no better.
Saddam Hussein.
If Democrats are going to be held accountable for 
being excessively dovish, then Republicans have to 
take the blame for allowing Saddam to misread 
U.S. intentions.
An attempt by Rep. Howard Berman (D-Cali- 
fomia) to impose sanctions on Iraq was vigorously 
opposed by the White House — four pleading calls 
on the very eve of Saddam’s invasion of Kuwait — 
and the Commerce Department was busy autho­
rizing the shipment of everything short of nuclear 
weapons.
Neither I nor other members of the press ever 
suggested that no other issues were raised when 
that senatorial delegation met with Saddam. And 
the criticism of Simpson might well have been 
muted had he conceded he had gone a bit too far in 
attempting to persuade Saddam to open his coun­
try to the Western media.
But instead, he has personalized the issue, 
charging in my case that I “fell smack into one of 
Saddam’s propaganda traps.”
But trapped or not, I sprouted the wings of a hawk 
over the war with Iraq. And to differ with Simpson
is not tantamount to siding with Saddam. Th 
imputation in his letter is clear—and not much 
different than Simpson’s charge, later retracted 
that CNN’s Pete Arnett was an Iraqi “sympaj 
thizer.”
Those sorts of accusations are out of bounds ani 
incompatible with Simpson’s office and his hi| 
senatorial rank. I say that as one wit to another.

ignored and excluded from the realm of 
“legitimate” debate. When a minority, 
however, obtains positions of relative 
power within liberal institutions and 
begins to insist on such issues, well, it’s 
enough to cause widespread panic. Which 
brings us to the question of the “PC” 
debate.
It should be pointed out that the terms 
used to describe the “political correctness 
movement” are not given by any of the 
people that phrase is meant to include. 
No one that I am aware of would char­
acterize himself or herself as one of the 
“advocates of political correctness rules,” 
as Levy puts it. The problem here is that 
the dominant logic of liberalism under­
stands itself as natural and the simple 
expression of common sense, rather than 
as one historically contingent way of 
thinking among others, appropriate to a 
specific social formation. Having no 
other terms than its own in which to 
construct another or its opponent, any­
thing that stands outside liberalism’s 
own field of vision simply becomes a 
distorted version of itself. Thus Time's 
conception in the heading, “In U.S. 
classrooms, battles are flaring over val­
ues that are almost the reverse image of 
the American mainstream,” is quite re­
vealing. This inevitable introversion may 
be why Levy sets himself the strange 
task of dissociating from himself that 
other “liberalism” that is giving his 
“liberalism” a bad name. This is also why 
the concerted campaign coming from vir­
tually every mainstream “news” source 
to smear the questions raised by leftists 
in the academy as “thought police” is 
precisely a thought-policing strategy 
aimed at restricting debate by discred­
iting any other position before any of its 
arguments can be heard. None of the 
accounts in Newsweek, Time, Atlantic 
Monthly, New York, or the rest allow 
space to any of those being attacked who 
would not corroborate the official line. 
The prospect of lifting liberalism’s veil 
on the dissymmetric power relations of 
the society or institutions in which 
knowledge is produced, roughly the task 
of those who could be loosely generalized 
for present purposes as “the academic 
left”—a phrase which itself blurs another 
set of fundamental differences — simply 
cannot be tolerated by the liberal ortho­
doxy. Thus the foreboding image of forces 
launching their “attack on the freedom 
of expression” is liberalism’s inverted 
mirror image itself.
Cases such as the one at Brown, where 
a student’s drunken, bigoted rage was 
ruled “abuse” rather than “free speech” 
is worthy of scrutiny, particularly since 
the claims of campus hostility to the free 
exchange of ideas of those who are not 
white, male, and heterosexual are typi­
cal of many American universities — 
even those quite close to home. But cases 
such as these turned into horror stories 
in the mainstream media, as if they were 
symptomatic of a new dominant order 
trying to take away our “free speech,” 
should be regarded skeptically at the 
very least. As we listen to the denun­
ciations of the “new McCarthyism” let us 
not forget that the old one was an attempt 
to destroy and discredit the left in the 
U.S. Recalling this, the real “new 
McCarthyism” looks a lot like the old.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Jonathan Levy’s re­
cent column in The 
Tartan [“Liberals fight 
idea of PC," 4/15], em­
bodies many of the con­
tradictions and misconceptions inform­
ing the so-called “PC debate” currently 
receiving attention in U.S. mainstream 
publications. In framing his discussion 
within the context of a conservative vs. 
liberal dispute, Mr. Levy not only re­
produces the limited spectrum within 
which most Americans think political 
choice, he also completely ignores the 
fact that the issues surrounding the poli­
tics of the American academy largely 
derive from the advances ofthe academic 
left.
Mr. Levy does not question the media 
claims that appeals to “political correct­
ness” lie at the heart of misguided insti­
tutional efforts to enforce “liberal” poli­
tics. Admonishing references to “people 
who make up the political correctness 
movement... conducting a witch hunt to
suppress the free exchange of ideas” in­
dicate that he fully accepts the terms 
within which the mainstream press seek 
to represent the currentcrisesin campus 
politics. Rather than challenge these 
terms, he simply insists that “the political 
correctness movement is not part of real 
liberalism.” Thus, Mr. Levy’s line of 
reasoning assumes: 1) that there is a 
“movement” by self-identified “PC” ad­
vocates; 2) that such a movement seeks 
to ally itself with a “liberal” politics; and 
3) that such alliance falsifies the genu­
ine concerns of a “liberalism” whose im­
puted task is the progressive transfor­
mation of American universities and 
campuses.
Mr. Levy fails to realize .that the “PC” 
moniker is, itself, a convenient media 
tag that functions to simplify and unify a 
range of confrontations over the politics 
of the American academy. Such issues 
include, but are by no means restricted 
to debates over institutional policies re­
garding the status of race, sex, gender, 
ethnicity, nationality, and class, and their 
relations to: design of curricula, criteria 
for analyses, the socio-historic conditions 
of knowledges, disciplinary canons, 
pedagogical practices, admission proce­
dures, and hiring and tenure policies for 
faculty and staff. In numerous articles, 
the mainstream media attempt to 
delegitimate this vast field of disparate 
concerns by focusing on isolatedinstances 
of controversial administrative policies
— for instance, the expulsion of a Brown 
student for “offensive speech,” and cam­
pus and classroom confrontation. These 
instances achieve the status of univer­
salized, disparaging metaphors — “PC,” 
“thought police”—which the media then 
affix to a host of people, groups and 
organizations workingin numerous ways 
and at a variety of levels within and 
outside the university structure to chal­
lenge the predominantly white, male, 
Euro-centric traditional American acad­
emy.
In this fashion, media representations 
predispose its readership to “think” these 
numerous issues purely in terms of a 
battle over “freedom of speech” — the 
ideological core to Mr. Levy’s “liberal­
ism.”
In its most common contemporary us­
age, “liberalism” names a generalized 
principle advocating the belief that a 
harmonious collective will be — or can be
— realized in and by the decisions and 
policies of a representative body of legisla­
tures. For Mr. Levy, that consensus be­
speaks certain “humane” emphases 
“concem[s] for victims of poverty, bigotry, 
and other evils”... as well as “minorities 
andothertraditionally oppressed groups.” 
Such a position takes the individual as the 
starting point and destination of political 
action, and thus is unable to understand 
the formation of collective identities or the 
collective aspect of social life — that the 
social is comprised of competing interests 
amonggroups,ratherthanheterogeneous, 
private individuals. One of the primary 
effects of this brand of individualism is 
precisely to mask the degree to which the 
personal is fundamentally implicated in 
social conditions and bound to modes of 
power which obtain in dominant institu­
tions.
In its institutionalized political forms 
in the U.S., liberalism tends to service 
the pseudo-privatized interests of pow­
erful corporate property owners from 
whom political constituencies derive their 
support and to whom they are therefore 
accountable. Within this framework, 
certain questions regarding the very 
structural arrangements of power can­
not be asked, since that would risk ex­
posing the extent to which procedural 
rules collaboratively function to regulate 
the maintenance and reproduction of a 
very undemocratic state of affairs.
Contemporary political democracy thus 
limits itself as an ideologically circum­
scribed instrumental activity, to the 
pursuit of powerful, specific group in­
terests. In this sense, the so-called “divi­
sion” between Democrats and Republi­
cans, liberals and conservatives mysti­
fies a shared investment in certain un­
questionable interests.
That is, liberal pluralism misses the 
fact that competing points of view only 
signal the terms in which debates are 
consciously thought, and the degree to 
which opponents have commensurable
In posing as a form of democratic pro­
cess, liberalism covertly functions to ratify 
the most deeply held, unquestioned, and 
often unrecognized assumptions shared 
by competing constituencies.
Thus, liberalism fails to recognize how 
dominant ideological and institutional 
conditions prefigure the legitimacy of 
certain positions and the illegitimacy of
others. Solutions to the disparities ii 
emphases and power within the Ameri 
can academy cannot be realized simpl 
through Mr. Levy’s appeals to the “fri 
exchange of ideas,” as such a positio 
regards institutions as neutral setting 
within which all positions have compi 
rable claims to legitimacy, and equ! 
means for effecting change.
Finally, Mr. Levy’s propensity to si 
the so-called “PC debate” from within tl 
liberalist problematic explains why tl 
academic left becomes relocated into t] 
conservative/liberal terrain in his arj 
ment. He freely reproduces the assump-j 
tion that university confrontation posi 
“liberals” against “conservatives,” when 
in fact, the politicalization of the acai 
emy has been primarily the result oi 
pressures coming from outside th 
tightly- policedboundaries ofthe consei 
vative liberal pseudo-opposition. In ai 
suming that “liberal” means ‘left,” Mi 
Levy eradicates very real distinction 
between crucially different political ¡1 
vestments and agendas existing betwee 
liberal and left-wing positions.
As such, the “left” is invisible in 
discussion — an effect largely attribul 
able to the very representations ofmai 
stream journalism Mr. Levy cites as 
sponsible for the confusion betweej 
“liberalism” and “political correctness; 
In posing the “PC debate” in terms of 
opposition between “the radicals on tl 
one side” — what Mr. Levy seems 
mean by “liberals” •— “and the conservi 
tives on the other,” Mr. Levy achievf 
two ideological effects: 1) the approprii 
tion and domestication of a pro-activ 
left politics that opposes both liberal an 
conservative positions; and 2) the furthi 
marginalization of those individual 
agencies, and organizations genuinelj 
seeking to challenge the dominance 
the traditional American academy-
To seriously address the conflicts 
problems surrounding the politics of th^ 
American academy requires that we sr 
outside of the framework within whii 
dominant institutional practices seek 
justify themselves, and access those arj 
ments and positions which lie at the hei 
of various left-wing challenges to the h 
gemony of traditional university power

The World League of Ameri­
can Football is entering its 
second full month of existence, 
which says to me that the fad 
should begin wearing off any 
day now. From watching a few 
games, I’ve come to the conclu­
sion that the WLAF has got to 
be the most convoluted piece of 
sports history I’ve ever seen.
And the intentions were so 
lofty, too. The whole wide world 
.. was going to get American 
football; instead, what the world 
got was a bunch of has-been’s 
and never-will-be’s while the 
people running the WLAF got 
fat off their collective gullibility.
There was never any inten­
tion of making the WLAF 
anything more than a low-cost 
money-maker. You could tell 
that by the fact that the TV 
contracts were signed before 
they really had any idea of what 
sort of players they had. The 
official WLAF merchandise was 
in stores long before the first 
snap was ever taken. I guess 
they wanted people to scoop up 
their WLAF stuff before the 
teams proved they stunk.
To their credit, the idea 
worked. My friend Jim bought 
himself a Barcelona Dragons 
baseball hat, and I’d bet 50 
dollars that he couldn’t even tell 
me the name of one of their 
players. Then again, how could 
I tell whether he’s right or not?
I don’t know one person on their 
roster.
The European representation 
on teams has been token at 
best. Instead, they get a bunch 
of washed-up NFL bench 
warmers to pretend they can 
really play. That of course 
brings up the question, “How 
can a bench warmer be washed 
up?”
The only exception to that 
rule comes when kickers are 
chosen. I can hear it now: You 
know, Europeans are great at 
soccer; why not let them kick? 
Just don’t put them in the 
starting lineup.
The media obviously isn’t 
taking the league too seriously 
—just look at the whole concept 
of the helmet-cam. The USA 
network is saying to us, “Well, 
we know the quality of play
...sucks, don’t you almost feel like
you’re the one overthrowing 
receivers by 20 yards?”
For that matter, they as­
signed Dan Marino to their 
number one coverage team.
Now I know I don’t speak the 
Queen’s English, but this guy 
struggles with complete sen­
tences. At least he knows his 
football, but a couple more shots 
to the head should take care of 
that.
It shows on the field, too. 
Going back to the Knights,
Head Coach Mouse Davis called 
three fake punts in one game. In 
any real sport, the Mouse would 
have been tossed out; no one 
looks twice in the WLAF. I 
guess Mouse was just too busy 
looking at the marketing 
projections to see the game film.
Unfortunately, the WLAF is 
here to stay. Since the NFL is 
ultimately fronting the WLAF, 
there’s no reason for them to 
run the WLAF out of business. 
There’s also no reason for the 
WLAF to try to competitively 
bid for players to raise the 
quality of the game they play.
Guess I’ll just have to go 
borrow Jim’s Barcelona hat.

CMU track stars gain recognition
Lowe and lllian scoring leaders for CMU at UAA
lllian was named the Men's Most 
Outstanding Performance of the Meet 
Award for his 23.5 points.____________
By DAVE MARTIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Senior sprinter Jeff lllian 
proved to be Carnegie Mellon 
University’s star performer over 
the weekend as the Tartans men’s 
track team placed third in the 
University Athletic Association 
outdoor track championships at 
the University of Rochester.
lllian was named the Men’s 
Most Outstanding Performance 
of the Meet Award for his 23.5 
points.
For the women, junior Carloyn 
Lowe gained the most points by 
winning the 5000-meter run and 
the placing second in the 3000- 
meter run.
The women’s team didn’t fare 
quite as well, however, as it placed 
sixth in the eight-team tourna­
ment.
Both lllian and Lowe led CMU 
in scoring in the University Ath­
letic Association.
lllian took first place in the 100- 
meter run, turning in a time of 
10.8 seconds. Sophomore Chris 
Maguire finished fifth in the race 
with a time of 11.5. lllian took 
first place again in the 200-meter 
dash with a time of 21.8.
He also anchored the second 
place 400-meter relay team, which 
finished with a time of 43.74 sec­
onds. Again at anchor, lllian 
helped the 1600-meter relay team 
win third place with a time of
3:32.36.
lllian and Lowe’s places were 
anticipated, since both have quali­
fied for NCAA Division III Na­
tionals. Lowe qualified in the 
5000-meter run during the win­
ter track season; lllian qualified 
in the spring.
Sophomore Bobby Bruce fin­
ished first for Carnegie Mellon in 
the javelin throw with a distance 
of 165' 1". Sophomore Jim Hodges 
placed third in the javelin throw, 
managing a throw of 156'7".
Brad Shapiro, a sophomore, 
placed third in the 1500-meter 
run with a time of4:06.53. Sopho­
more Scott Phillips’ time of 
9:53.45 in the 3000-meter steeple­
chase got him fifth place.
Sophomore Matt McGarvey fin­
ished fourth in the pole vault, 
clearing a height of 11'3 3/4". In 
the triple jump, freshman 
Brandyn Woodard placed fourth, 
jumping a distance of 40'6 1/4".
For the women, Lowe was the 
major point scorer, winning the 
5000-meter run with a time of 
18:38.17, as' well as placing sec­
ond in the 3000-meter run with a 
time of 10:46.25.
Senior Lisa Schmidt won sec­
ond place in the 400-meter dash 
with a time of 1:02.48. Schmidt 
also took third in the 200-meter 
dash, cranking out a time of 27.37 
seconds.
Freshman Jodi Piccolo placed 
fifth in the women’s javelin throw 
competition with a 85'4" effort. 
She also finished sixth in the triple 
jump with a distance of 2910 1/ 
4".

Despite beating the weather to 
improve its team score by one 
stroke between the first and sec­
ond rounds of the University Ath­
letics Association Golf Champi­
onships, Carnegie Mellon lost its 
narrow two-stroke first-day hold 
on fourth place and finished in a 
fifth place tie with New York 
University Thursday and Friday.
Case Western Reserve Univer­
sity passed Carnegie Mellon to 
finish fourth in the competition 
won by the Rochester at 
Pittsburgh’s Longue Vue Coun­
try Club.
Coach Rich Erdelyi was disap­
pointed with the results, saying
“Realistically, I thought we could 
take fourth.” Bad weather made 
Friday’s play more difficult than 
Thursday’s. “The conditions were 
pretty severe the second day,” 
Erdelyi said.
The team usually ends up in 
the middle of the pack, he said, 
noting that it was facing tough 
competition against the Univer­
sity of Rochester, which is ranked 
fifth in the nation, and 18th 
ranked Emory University, the sec­
ond place team in the champion­
ships.
Team member Brent Jones, a 
sophomore math major, described 
his feelings about the results as 
“not really disappointed but not 
really good at all.”
“We came in fifth,” he said.
“That’s about it.”
Competition was initially close 
near the top. Emory University, 
which stood only four strokes be­
hind Rochester for first place and 
five ahead of third place Wash­
ington University at the end of 
Thursday’s round, fell 16 strokes 
back of Rochester’s winning score 
of 651 and topped Washington by 
the slim margin of 667-669.
Case Western finished play 40 
strokes behind Washington at 
709, followed by Carnegie Mellon 
and New York at 713 and 
Brandéis’ seventh place score of' 
722.
Erdelyi praised his newer play­
ers, saying “We had two fresh­
men who are probably our best 
two players.”
The pair, MCS student Ryan 
Elliott and architecture major Ed 
Lee, traded inconsistent perfor­
mances between the two days 
while leading the team. Elliott 
had a good day Thursday and 
dropped off Friday to finish 14th 
best among 35 competitors with a 
score of 174. Lee had his better 
score on the second day, finishing 
16th with a score of 176.
The other CMU players were 
Sam Trinch, a junior electrical 
and computer engineering major, 
who finished 24th with a score of 
181; Jones, at 28th, with a score of 
187; and junior English major 
Andrew Marshall, 31st with 190 
strokes.
Prospects for Carnegie Mellon’s 
team appear good, “We’ve got a
good team. We just haven’t hit 
them yet,” Jones said. He pre­
dicted success in CMU’s four re­
maining competitions of the sea­
son. “We’ve got a shot at the rest 
of them,” he said.
Erdelyi said he is persuingthree 
good players. “I think I have an 
excellent chance to get two out of 
the three,” he said.
CMU’s final three competitions 
of the year are all in the next 
week. The team plays in the Wash­
ington and Jefferson Invitational 
today and plays Bethany College 
tomorrow at Longue Vue. The last 
two competitions are in Boston, 
against MIT alone Sunday and 
five or six other technical schools, 
including MIT, in Monday’s 
Engineer’s Cup.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s lacrosse 
club bombed St. Vincent’s College 18-5 
Saturday at Gesling Stadium.
“We crushed them,” said senior co­
captain Phil Kaplan.
Because some players were busy with 
Spring Carnival, Carnegie Mellon played 
shorthanded. As a result, junior 
defensemen Marty Reed and senior 
Hudson Tiffany played mid-field as the 
second main line.
“Some of our defensemen had to play 
mid-field and they played a great game,” 
said Kaplan.
Although shorthanded, Carnegie Mel­
lon managed to score a total of 18 goals. 
In the goal tally, senior Rob Kendall 
scored five, junior Todd Bredbenner 
scored four, graduate student Bayard 
Johnson scored four, senior John 
Seekings scored three, Kaplan scored 
two, and junior Steve Ramey scored one. 
Also, Seekings had three assists in CMU’s 
win.
Carnegie Mellon scored four goals in 
both the first and second quarter. St. 
Vincent only scored one goal in each of 
the first three quarters. In the third 
quarter, St. Vincent held Carnegie Mel­
lon to only three goals. However, Carn­
egie Mellon really went after them and 
scored seven goals in the fourth quarter 
and held St. Vincent to only two more 
goals.
“It was never close at all,” said senior 
co-captain and goaltender Peter 
Vonderlieth.
Kendall said, “The offense controlled 
the game and we scored well.”
The Carnegie Mellon’s offense was able 
to control the game by winning every 
faceoff except for two. Seekings, who 
won every one of Carnegie Mellon’s 
faceoffs, was a key player. While Seekings 
was out with an injury, senior Jay Nesbitt 
also dominated several faceoffs against 
St. Vincent College.
Vonderlieth made 14 saves. “[He] 
played an excellent game in goal,” said 
Kaplan.
Although St. Vincent’s goalie played 
well, the team’s defense was poor as a 
whole.
“[The St. Vincent’s goalie] snuffed us 
out of a lot of goals because he was a fast 
goalie,” said Kaplan.
Kendall said, “Their goalie was good 
but their defense sucked.”
“This was a considerable victory be­
cause St. Vincent is a Division III team 
and we are just a club sport. I didn’t 
expect it,” said Vonderlieth.

Special to the Tartan
Last Friday the crew team travelled to 
Charleston, West Virginia for the 
Governor’s Cup Regatta at the Univer­
sity of Charleston. The competition in­
cluded teams from Ohio State, Marrietta, 
Mercyhurst, and Wichita State.
CMU raced in six events. Junior Shawn 
Ohler competed in his first race in the 
men’s heavyweight single scull division. 
Although he finished fourth in his heat, 
his performance was quite good for his 
first competition.
The men’s heavy four and men’s light 
four both made excellent showings in 
their events, but were unable to proceed 
to the finals. The light men finished 
fourth, within five seconds of the third 
and fifth place finishers.
Bad luck befell the men’s novice four. 
They were third place off of the start, 
making their attack for second when one 
of their oarlocks opened, releasing the 
oar and forcing them to drop from their 
position. After a quick recovery, they 
had an excellent second half of the race, 
but were unable to recover lost ground.
"This race takes quite a commitment from 
the crew. They miss Spring Carnival to com­
pete in a very tough race.”
— coach Liz Winter
The CMU staff members entered their 
first competition in the men’s club four. 
They finished fifth out of six.
The heavyweight women’s four made 
finals for the second time this semester. 
The boat consisting of senior Julie Sex­
ton, senior Antine Stenbit, senior Abigail 
Ochberg and junior Anna Loney, with 
sophomore coxswain Kim McCormick 
destroyed their preliminary round com­
petition, winning by over a boat-length.
In the finals they came from behind to 
finish in a time of 7:31.1, six seconds 
ahead of Duquense. “We were expecting 
our tough competition to be Mercyhurst,” 
explained Sexton, “but as the race be­
gan, we pulled away, with Duquense in 
the lead. They made a lot of mistakes, 
giving us plenty of opportunity to get 
way ahead.”
Coach Liz Winter was quite satisfied
with the regatta. “This race takes quite 
a commitment from the crew. They miss 
Spring Carnival to compete in a very 
tough race. The crews’performance was 
excellent, especially the heavyweight 
women, they are having a great season.”
“The novice men had a great race. 
With any better luck, they will make., 
finals at their next race in two weeks,” J 
said assistant coach Francine Green.
Winter explained the importance of , 
this race to the rest of the season. “We 
are having a good season. These races 
are important by their own right, but 
they are also preparation for our two last 
races, MACRA and Dad Vails. These 
races are the peak of our season.
“Our crews are showing great improve- 
ment as the season progresses. I am • 
confident we will make a strong showing 
at these final event§ next month!”

Pirates’ powerhouses struggle early in 1991
NL EAST
Pirates Doug Drabek and Barry 
Bonds, who helped the team win 
the division title in 1990, both 
continue to struggle in 1991. 
Drabek, who won the 1990 Cy 
Young award, lost his third 
straight game of the season Thurs­
day, 3—2, to the Chicago Cubs. 
Bonds has been mired in a hitting 
slump since the start of the sea­
son. He has had only two hits all 
season, and ¡has had none in his 
past 14 at bats through Friday. 
Despite this and other woes, the 
Pirates have managed to squeak 
out a 7-5 record (through Satur­
day).
The Chicago Cubs, however, 
continue to lead the division with 
a 7-4 record. The surprise has 
been how little the threesome of 
Andre Dawson, George Bell, and 
Ryne Sandberg has had to do with 
that lead. Dawson, who hit 88 
home runs last year, leads the 
group this year with a .269 aver­
age and one home run. Sandberg 
and Bell were both hovering 
around the .200 mark at the end 
of last week.
New York right fielder Hubie 
Brooks has proved himself a more

than adequate successor to Darryl 
Strawberry, so far. Brooks hit. 320 
in his first seven games, sharing 
the team lead in homers with two.
NL WEST
Pitcher Rob Dibble of the Reds 
was suspended for three games, 
and outfielder Kevin Mitchell of 
the Giants for two games, each for 
his role in different bench-clearing 
fights.
On April 11, Dibble narrowly 
missed Houston shortstop Eric 
Yelding with a fast ball, spurring 
a fight. On April 10, Mitchell at­
tacked San Diego pitcher Bruce 
Hurst after being hit in the foot 
with a pitch. Mitchell received 
the suspension because he had to 
be restrained by San Diego first 
baseman Fred McGriff, after
threatening to seriously injure 
Hurst.
San Diego jumped out to an 
early 21/2-game lead in the divi­
sion, then lost two of three games 
in a home stand against Cincin­
nati. San Diego still held first 
going into Saturday’s games, how­
ever, with a 7-3 record.
The Dodgers lineup, which the 
team has boldly predicted would 
lead it to the World Series, has 
provided the offense to do just 
that.
Those same players, however, 
have played a sufficiently Tjad 
enough defense to start the Dodg­
ers off on another season of medi­
ocrity. Shortstop Alfredo Griffin 
has been especially terrible, com­
mitting three errors in his first 
six games. j
Overall, the Dodgers field a well- 
below-average defensive team, 
with, in addition to Griffin, sec­
ond baseman Juan Samuel and 
left fielder Kal Daniels being es­
pecially big liabilities with the 
glove. The Dodgers’ poor defen­
sive play, coupled with the team’s 
weak bullpen, may cause the team 
to lose many close games.
The Dodgers may make a trade, 
however, and save themselves
from such a nightmare.
One popular rumor had the Los 
Angeles Dodgers trading several 
young players to the St. Louis 
Cardinals for veteran shortstop 
and 10-time Gold-Glove winner 
Ozzie Smith. Not only would 
Smith improve the Dodgers’ in­
field defense immeasurably, he 
would provide the team with a 
better hitter and runner than 
Griffin, as well.
ALEAST
Boston pitcher Roger Clemens 
brought a lip reader to testify for 
him in a hearing with baseball 
commissioner Fay Vincent to ap­
peal Clemens’ five-day suspen­
sion.
Deborah Copeland, who is deaf 
and works with the New York 
Society for the Deaf, was brought 
to testify about her interpreta­
tion of what Clemens said on a 
videotape of the fourth game of 
the American League playoffs 
against Oakland.
Clemens was fined $10,000 and 
suspended for five games by 
American League president 
Bobby Brown after Clemens en­
gaged in a shouting match with
umpire Terry Cooney. Part of 
Clemens’ punishment resulted 
from reported verbal slander he 
shouted at Cooney during the 
game.
Vincent said he will announce a 
decision sometime this week.
On the playing field, Clemens’ 
pitching has been the bright spot 
of an otherwise mediocre start by 
the defending division champion 
Red Sox. Clemens won his first 
three games. He has pitched a 
total of 25 innings in those three 
games, giving up only 12 hits and 
one earned run.
Toronto held a tenuous lead over 
the rest of the division at week’s 
end. After storming out of the 
gates, the Blue Jays did little more 
than hang on to a one-game lead 
over the course of last week.
Any team in the division, with 
the possible exception of the New 
York Yankees (who Friday stood 
at 3-6), appear able to take the 
divisional lead with a strong week 
or two of play.
AL WEST
The Detroit Tigers spoiled the 
Chicago White Sox’s first game in 
new Comiskey Park, drumming
the Sox 16-0. Tony Phillips, Cecil 
Fielder, and Rob D eer all hit home 
runs for the Tigers, who broke the 
game open with a ten-run fourth 
inning.
Oakland, despite being troubled 
by injuries, lead the division at 
week’s end. Oakland relief pitcher 
Gene Nelson had his finger bro­
ken by a line-drive foul ball hit 
into the Oakland dugout.
Oakland outfielder Rickey 
Henderson continued to sit out of 
the lineup with an injured ham­
string. Henderson, who is one 
short of Lou Brock’s lifetime 
record of 937 stolen bases, will 
attempt to break the record upon 
returning to the lineup.
The Seattle Mariners broke 
their season opening losing streak 
by starting a three-game winning 
streak against the Minnesota 
Twins.
The Mariners had started the 
season with six straight losses 
against California and Oakland; : 
but easily beat the Twins in all 
three games in Seattle.
Gary Gaetti hit his first home 
run as an Angel last Thursday, 
and in the process ended the 
team’s 122 at bat homerless 
streak.

Baseball bats two for two against Pitt-Greensburg
By ALIM RAY
Tartan Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon baseball club 
avoided being rained out only one day 
out of three this week as it won both 
games in a double-header against Pitt- 
Greensburg on Thursday. Monday’s and 
Tuesday’s games were cancelled due to 
the bad weather.
The first game was controlled by Car­
negie Mellon. Freshman John Knutson 
pitched for seven innings with 13 
strikeouts and six hits to take an 8-4
win. Freshman Chad Yoshikawa and 
juniors Mike Petrich, Mike Gess, and 
Dave Beltz fueled the CMU offense with 
a combination of seven , hits and eight 
RBI’s. Sophomore Mike Fugaro sealed 
the victory by hitting a home run in the 
bottom of the sixth to put CMU up by 
three runs.
“I got lucky with it,” Fugaro said. “It 
sealed the game for us ... and made us 
feel a lot more stable with ourselves 
[going into the last innings].”
Petrich, who has helped with the team’s 
recent hitting spree, has been hitting
well since coming back from a knee in­
jury acquired in IM football last fall. “I’ve 
been a little surprised about it [my good 
hitting],” Petrich said.
Before Thursday’s double-header, 
Petrich believes “everybody has been 
hitting well but just not in the right 
space [when runners are on].”
The second game saw a comeback by 
Pitt-Greensburg in the seventh inning. 
Carnegie Mellon was ahead 6-3 with 
Gregg Clarke, a University Publications 
production artist, pitching when Pitt ex­
ploded with four runs to take a 7-6 lead.
Gess relieved Clarke and was able to 
hold on to an 8-7 win with some offen­
sive help.
In the bottom of the seventh, Beltz 
doubled and was driven in by a Fugaro 
single. Then Yoshikawa got on first and 
was brought home by freshman John 
Hutchinson.
“It made us really put it together,” 
Fugaro said of Pitt’s lead. “I think we’ve 
shown a much more agressive offense. I 
don’t remember any guys going down 
looking.”
Beltz also praised the CMU offense.
“We had a few guys hitting well,” Beltz 
said. “We have had a little bit of trouble 
in the beginning of the season.... We did 
seem to come up more aggressively [in 
this game].”
CMU recorded 14 hits in the second 
game with freshman Ryan Schmiedl, 
Yoshikawa, Gess, and Hutchinson all 
getting two hits. Head coach Neil 
Stoemell believes his team gets better as 
it plays more games. “With baseball, the 
more you play the better you get,” 
Stoemell said. “[It’s] not like football 
where you need a rest every week.”

CMU women’s lacrosse nets two for the week
By STEPHEN KANG
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon women’s lacrosse 
club defeated Bethany College 13-9 at 
Gesling Stadium Thursday afternoon. 
On Sunday, Carnegie Mellon played Al­
legheny College, also at Gesling, to win 
8-7.
The weather played a huge role in 
Sunday’s game, as a steadily dropping 
temperature coupled with a light driz­
zling rain, made the astroturf field very 
slippery.
Because the Carnegie Mellon was play­
ing without any substitute players, the 
team barely had enough to play all the 
positions on the field. The game was a 
see-saw battle, as each team kept the 
scoring tight. At halftime, the score was 
tied at five.
With only two minutes left in the game, 
Carnegie Mellon scored two consecutive 
goals to go ahead 8-6. However, the
The game took on a fierce pace with both 
teams coming out shooting.______________
game was far from being over — Allegh­
eny scored the next two goals. However, 
the second goal for Allegheny was wiped 
out by a penalty call, so CMU pulled out 
the 8—7 win.
Thursday’s game was fast-paced, with 
Carnegie Mellon playing a tough de­
IM Scoreboard
fense to hold down Bethany’s skilled 
attack. Both junior Inge Swenson and 
senior Hillary Kahn played goalie; 
Swenson allowed three goals in the first 
half and Kahn let in six goals in the 
second half. At halftime, Carnegie Mel­
lon was on top 4-3.
In the second half, the game took on a 
fierce pace with both teams coming out 
shooting. Carnegie Mellon graduate stu­
dent Carolyn Pfatteitcher scored five 
goals, and freshman Thomasina Choi 
and sophomore Shannon Hayes each 
scored four goals for CMU to seal the 13-
9 victory.
With two wins against two similarly 
matched teams, Carnegie Mellon plays 
its next game against Juniata this Sun­
day at 12:30 pm in Gesling Stadium.
SOFTBALL
All intramural softball teams are
reminded that teams that play at
6:30.jjm cannot use the stadium
ietdSJuntil 6:15 pm. Please do not
coiflBHii the field any earlier since

Department thanks you for your
cooperation.

Spring Carnival flourishes at 
Carnegie Mellon since 1920
By CHARLES SABATOS
Tartan Staffwriter
Canyouimagine CamegieMellon with­
out Spring Carnival — without Midway 
rides engulfing the Skibo parking lot, 
booths sparkling with ingenuity, bug-
> flying down Tech Street at break­
neck speeds, and students, perhaps for 
the only time in the year, actually having 
fan rather than complaining about the 
Misery for which they’re paying more 
than twenty grand a year?
Neither qan most Carnegie Mellon 
alumni. Many return nostalgically each 
year — which is appropriate, since Car­
nival began in the early days of Carnegie 
fech as a type of Homecoming event. In 
feet, the idea of “Campus Week” was first 
conceived in 1920 by Gilmore L. 
Filbrooka, a 1915 alumnus who was 
Mumni Executive Secretary at the time. 
The first three-day celebration was held 
that year from May 13-15.
‘Campus Week,” states an annual bro­
chure for Campus Week written in the 
®id-1920s, was “a period set aside at 
Carnegie Tech, during which all the 
alumni are expected to return to the 
Campus and renew old friendships and 
®emories, and make new ones.” The 
svents included “the carefree atmosphere
Carnival began in the 
early days of Carnegie 
Tech as a type of 
Homecoming event
of the Mardi Gras, the thrills of the 
Sweepstakes, the beauty of the Corona­
tion, the hundred and one little events 
which are Campus Week; all serve to 
make it a period of never-to-be-forgotten 
enjoyment.”
Although few of these events sound 
familiar, the “Sweepstakes” mentioned 
was the Interfratemity Sweepstakes, the 
earliest buggy races. And during the 
first few years of Campus Week, the 
presentation of an annual student play 
became a custom.
Undergraduates participated as en­
thusiastically as possible. “Indeed,” said 
then-Dean A.W. Tarbell, “so active be­
came their cooperation, and so much 
time was consumed by them in prepar­
ing for this relaxation period, and in 
settling down to studies after it, that a 
professor much given to persiflage once 
dryly dubbed the occasion ‘Campus
Month.’ ”
A letter from the faculty dated Decem­
ber, 1928, proposed that Campus Week 
be cancelled. Stated the letter, “Some 
departments found it useless to attempt 
any new work after Campus Week and 
were compelled to devote the time to 
reviewing.” Alumni festivities* were 
switched to a Homecoming in the fall so 
they could coincide with a football game, 
and Campus Week was then cancelled.
Of course, students refused to accept 
the loss of their tradition, already well- 
established after eight years. In 1930, 
the administration relented, and the cel­
ebration was reestablished. The new 
event was somewhat toned down and, to 
separate it from the unfavorable reputa­
tion of Campus Week, was retitled “The 
Carnegie Carnival.” The carnival actu­
ally started on Thursday night, May 8, 
with a “Coronation Ball,” but most events 
were held May 9-10, including a “Coun­
try Fair” in the Gym, other dances, and 
a play called “The Show Off.” Buggy, of 
course, was also continued.
One tradition that had already existed 
but was incorporated into Carnival was 
the “Welding of the Carnegie Chain.” In 
1915, this chain had been created by an 
instructor in the college’s Forge Shop,

Shogun gives Phi Kap second consecutive title
By JENNIFER FORBES
Tartan Production Manager
Phi Kappa Theta
Shogun 
The Booth: Phi Kap’s booth was 
an elegant pagoda with rice-pa- 
per walls and authentic paper 
lanterns and banners in front of 
the booth. Inside, the smell of 
incense overtook patrons as they 
gazed at the fans, scrolls, and 
parasols. Brothers carrying 
swords and wearing kimonos 
greeted visitors. Phi Kap Booth 
Chair Michael Mo said, “We’re 
competitive because we’re will­
ing to put in the time and effort. 
We went on a three-day road trip 
just to get the bamboo.”
The Game: Patrons must first 
kneel on a mat before being pre­
sented with stacks of six disks 
and a mallet. They had to knock 
out the bottom disk without up­
setting the rest of the pile until 
there was only the top disk left.
Phi Kap placed first in the fra­
ternity division.
Sigma Tau Gamma
Don Quixote 
The Booth: Sig Tau presented 
an elaborate windmill complete 
with climbing ivy and windows. 
According to Adam Nemitoff, 
booth chair, Sig Tau picked this 
novel because it offered the op­
portunity to build a large struc­
ture with moving parts and al­
lowed a break from the traditional 
box-like booth. Nemitoff says, “We 
tried for more authenticity. Ev­
erything on the booth really be­
longs on a windmill.”
The Game: In this game, the 
patrons steer a miniaturized Don 
Quixote through a forest and over 
a bridge to the windmill. There 
Don Quixote must “ldll” the giant.
Sig Tau placed second in the 
fraternity division.
Delta Upsilon
Swiss Family Robinson 
The Booth: DU’S elaborately deco­
rated tree house came complete 
with vines, ship’s figurehead, and 
steeringwheel. Douglas Vunic, DU 
booth chair, said, “We’re competi­
tive because we had an idea that 
hasn’t been tried before. We have
something that’s different.”
The Game: Pirates were invad­
ing the tree house and the patrons 
had to stop them by shooting can­
nonballs through vines at the pi­
rates. First, players lined up their 
shots by looking through the floor 
of the tree house and turning the 
ship’s wheel until the vines were 
lined up with a pirate. Then they 
dropped the “cannon ball” down 
the chute to check their aim.
DU placed third in the frater­
nity division.
The remaining fraternities are 
listed in alphabetical order.
Alpha Epsilon Pi
Peanuts 
The Booth: Snoopy’s doghouse 
served as the setting, for AEPi’s 
booth. Snoopy sat atop the dog­
house, and inside Peanuts car­
toons decorated the walls while 
music played in the background. 
Booth Chair Daniel Cohn said, 
“We came up with the idea be­
cause a lot of people at the frater­
nity like the Peanuts. It’s cute 
and will attract kids.”
The Game: The players rolled 
balls down a chute onto the game 
board. The board had sticks pro­
truding from it, directing the ball 
into one of the ten slots. One or 
two balls in one of the two slots 
with crosses was a winner, as 
were two balls in one of the two 
bulls-eye slots. The game’s popu­
larity, said AEPi, gave them a 
competitive edge.
Alpha Tau Omega
Pet Sematary 
The Booth: In an old, weather­
beaten cemetery lay the head­
stones of ATO’s open-air booth.
The Game: In keeping with the 
horror theme, ATO’s game was 
scariest for members of ATO 
themselves. Patrons threw water 
balloons at their faces, which 
stuck out through a backdrop.
Beta Theta Pi
Clifford 
The Booth: Beta had an open- 
air booth this year. Prominently 
featured in their booth was 
Clifford, the big red dog. Ed 
Kilduff, co-chair, said, “We’re
A toothy, grinning “Wild Thing" cheerfully stares at passersby in DTD’s Where the Wild Things Are.
more competitive than in previ­
ous years. We didn’t want to com­
pete with DU and DTD. We 
wanted the kids to appreciate it.” 
The Game: The idea behind 
Beta’s game was to throw basket­
balls through a hoop placed on 
Clifford’s tongue.
Delta Tau Delta
Where the Wild Things Are 
The Booth: The familiar mon­
sters of Where the Wild Things Are 
adorned DTD’s booth. Visitors en­
tered through Max’s bedroom (Max 
was the little boy of the story) and
continued to the land of the Wild 
Things. Eric Heiman, DTD booth 
chair, said, “We picked Where the 
Wild Things Are because it’s like 
the theme of our house.” Heiman 
also felt, “We’re not as competitive 
as DU or Phi Kap, but we’re proud 
of what was done, and more people 
got involved this year.”
The Game: Players had to sail 
Max’s ship from the land of the 
Wild Things to home, without hit­
ting any of the islands. The game 
and booth proved to be very popu­
lar with children, who loved the 
crowns they won as prizes.
Kappa Delta Rho
Snow White 
The Booth: From the outside, 
KDR’s booth seemed like an ordi­
nary house, but once patrons 
stepped inside, they were trans­
ported to a diamond mine. The 
flickering candles, textured walls,, 
and ultraviolet light helped set 
the mood. According to Dylan 
Newlander, booth chair, “We’re 
competitive because we have an 
original idea. Our booth is less 
complicated, but it’s more fun and 
more interesting.”
The Game: Snow White was
Augustine Kuo/Tartan Photographer
about to be married and the 
dwarves wanted to mine the per­
fect diamond for her. Patrons 
fished through the pool of water 
to find a diamond, which was then 
placed in the diamond selector to 
see if it was “perfect.”
Kappa Sigma
Life in Hell 
The Booth: Modeled after Matt 
Groening’s popular cartoon, Kappa 
Sig’s booth was adorned by an 11- 
foot character from the comic strip.

Victory tastes sweet for Chi 0
Pioneers’ Dr. Seuss shines in independents’

Pioneers
The World Of Doctor Seuss
The Booth: The bright yellow 
house with angular purple trim 
brought back many childhood 
memories of crazy rhymes and 
tongue twisters. The booth was 
an eclectic version of random Doc­
tor Seuss titles. “We wanted to 
integrate as many of the titles as 
possible into the game,” said Bill 
Cheeseman, co-chair with Bill 
Sabram. The secret to their booth 
was to “get artistic people involved 
and make a schedule and stick to 
it and work like hell,” said 
Cheeseman.
The Game: The game itself in­
corporated six of the Doctor Seuss 
books. For each of the six, there 
was a main character on which a 
relevant item was thrown. For 
instance, the Green Eggs and Ham 
station had a green ham on which 
eggs were thrown.
Pioneers placed first in the in­
dependent division.
SDC
The Time Machine
The Booth: Once a visitor’s eyes 
adjusted to the red, blue, and 
green lighting, his or her atten­
tion was drawn to the floor tiles 
which comprised the game. Each 
tile was designed with a signifi­
cant date and event in history. 
What took the most time in build­
ing the booth “was definitely the 
floor,” said Walt Schearer, SDC’s 
co-chair with Debra Millison. The 
Wes had to be randomly lit and 
registered when a traveler landed 
°n them. “It probably took more 
than 250 hours for the whole 
booth,” remarked Schearer.
The Game: The object was to 
Jurnp on to each tile as it was lit 
and leap through time. By jump- 
^g on five, ten, fifteen, or twenty 
squares within the given time 
constraint, patrons successfully 
time traveled without being 
sucked into dimensionless 
°blivion. Each level received a 
tatter prize.
SDC placed second in the inde­
pendent division.
ASA
The Last Emperor
The Booth: The small Japanese 
house caught a visitor’s eye im­
mediately with its bright gold roof. 
The gold was set off by a bright 
red background with green let­
tering and trim. Though based on 
the book, it didn’t exactly follow 
it. The game attempted to rein­
state the emperor, whereas the 
book left the, emperor a civilian. 
“We’re just trying to bring him 
back to power for fun”, said Julius 
Pulmano who helped with the 
booth on Saturday. The booth was 
chaired by Hendrick Kiamzon.
Game: The player was chal­
lenged to reinstate the emperor 
and his council. This was done by 
throwing golden balls into a small 
throne and two small chairs. If 
the emperor alone was reinstated, 
the prize was a fortune cookie. If 
only the council was reseated, the 
prize was a bag of fortune cookies. 
If all three, the player won a bag 
of fortune cookies and a decora­
tive tin.
ASA placed third in the inde­
pendent division.
The remaining independents are 
listed in alphabetical order.
Air Force ROTC
Red Baron
The Booth: This non-competi­
tive booth was decorated with dif­
ferent Air Force posters and 
chaired by Beth Ward.
The Game: The game involved 
throwing velcro balls at an air­
plane. Where the balls stuck de­
termined the number of points 
received. Prizes included maps, 
posters, ice scrapers, and squeeze 
bottles. There were also small 
rubber planes as consolation 
prizes.
CIA
Treasure Island
The Booth: In keeping with its 
theme, CIA'built a ship’s deck 
with a masted sail and a cabin 
that housed the game. The cabin 
was decorated authentically with 
fishing nets and a standing globe.
The booth was chaired by Connie 
Wai.
The Game: A ship with mesh 
sails had a rope that descended to 
the bottom of the ocean and is tied 
to a treasure chest. In order to get 
the treasure, a bag of chocolate 
coins, one had to get three pirate 
dolls with hooks for hands and 
feet onto the sail, tilting the ship 
over and raising the treasure 
chest. One successfully attached 
pirate was worth a butterscotch 
candy and two were worth an eye 
patch.
Computer Club
Arthur C. Clarke’s 2000 Series
The Booth: This booth included 
custom-designed computer soft­
ware and hardware and was based 
upon the movie 2001, where Hal 
the computer began to kill the 
crew members of a space craft. 
The booth had large lit panels 
which represented Hal’s computer 
chips and an electronic timer and 
score card. All the circuitry was 
run through the club’s computer. 
The booth was chaired by Aymerik 
Renard.
The Game: The object was to 
render Hal inoperable. This was 
done by hitting randomly lit pan­
els with bean-bag monoliths. In 
the first round, players were given 
eight seconds to hit three lit pan­
els. Each round thereafter they 
needed to hit one more panel in 
one less second.
FRINGE
Gulliver’s Travels
The Booth: Fringe paid a lot of 
attention to detail with its booth, 
a replica of the Lilliputian hill­
side. Goldfish swam in the harbor 
and the village lit up at night. 
“It’s been very successful,” said 
Tad Dockstader, a Tartan Con­
tributing Editor, who helped man 
the booth Saturday. Glenn 
Cottrell was booth chair.
The Game: The player stood at 
the top of the booth and cata­
pulted miniature balls down 
through the village into the 
Lilliputian harbor below. If the 
ball landed on the dock or in a 
boat, the player won. The game 
was more than reasonably priced, ; 
with 5 shots for twenty-five cents. ;
KGB
The Hunt For Red October
The Booth: The submarine 
loomed large on the midway. Tom 
Strong, chair of the booth, said, 
“Construction started in Febru­
ary with weekly work sessions.” 
The sessions started at 7 pm and 
could last until three in the morn­
ing, said Thomas Smith, who 
manned the booth Saturday af­
ternoon.
The Game: Patrons only had 
four depth charges, cleverly dis­
guised as bean-bags, with which 
to hit four enemy subs in ascend-

Chi Omega 
/dice in Wonderland 
The Booth: Chi Omega’s construction 
chair Chris Kirmse said that Chi 0 tried 
to pick a “book that people recognized 
and that we could use our imagination 
with.” The Chi 0 booth was an open- 
front card house containing the Mad 
Hatter’s tea party.
The Game: Patrons tossed “sugar 
cubes”—ping-pong balls —into tea cups 
set up on the table in the booth.
Chi Omega placed first in the sorority 
division.
Kappa Kappa Gamma
Restaurant at the End of the Universe 
The Booth: Kappa wanted to make the 
booth parallel the book by making it 
seem like, “[You] are flying through space 
and don’t know where [you] are going to 
,” said Assistant Booth Chair Alexis 
DePlanque. The game was housed in the 
back of their L-shaped booth.
The Game: Patrons tossed a ping pong 
ball through one of the holes in the spin­
ning disk which was on the back wall.
Kappa Kappa Gamma placed second 
in the sorority division.
The remaining sororities are listed in 
alphabetical order.
Delta Delta Delta
The Three Little Pigs 
The Booth: Inside the third pig’s brick
house were the back-halves of the three 
pigs sticking out from under the bed. The 
Big Bad Wolf was climbing down the 
chimney and his foot dangled over a 
cauldron in the fireplace.
The Game: Using an air-gun, patrons 
shot a ping-pong ball through the hole in 
each of the three model houses.
Delta Gamma
Winnie the Pooh 
The Booth: The DGs felt that they met 
their booth goal this year. “We wanted 
something cute yet classy,” said Jessica 
Leopold. “The kids really like it, espe­
cially the Winnie the Pooh and Tigger 
characters.” DG’s open booth had six- 
foot tall models of Winnie the Pooh and 
Tigger standing in front. Other charac­
ters from the stories were carved into the 
two walls.
The Game: Patrons played miniature 
golf with two ways to win: They could 
either putt the ball through a fallen, 
hollow tree into the hole, or putt it up a 
ramp into a knot-hole where it was redi­
rected back out through the bottom of 
the tree and toward the hole.
Kappa Alpha Theta
The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe 
The Booth: The Thetas’ octagonal booth 
was made to look like the wardrobe on 
the outside and Namia on the inside. “It 
is the biggest booth we’ve ever had struc­
turally,” said Jennifer Falter.
The Game: Patrons played skee-ball, 
rolling a ball up a ramp and aiming for 
the center of a series of concentric circles.

Spirit nabs two of top three as Vicious Flow takes buggy

Tartan Contributing Editor
Spirit is back on top of the men’s 
buggy heap. After losing to Pi Kappa 
Alpha in last year’s Sweepstakes, 
Spirit returned to form, winning its 
fourth men’s title in five years.
Spirit’s A buggy, Vicious Flow, which 
helped Pika’s cause by crashing into a 
hay bale last year, rolled a 2:10.63 on 
Saturday to finish its victory in the 
53-team field. Pika’s new A buggy, 
Lone Wolf, came in second with a 
2:11.04 race, and Spirit B finished the 
top three with a 2:12.38 mark.
“We did extremely well. Gettingfirst, 
third, and seventh makes this a ban­
ner year for us,” said Spirit buggy 
chair Terence Yarde, a senior social 
and decision sciences major. “I’m proud 
of everyone on all our teams.”
“I was very pleased with the races,” 
said Sweepstakes chair Ray Fratto, a 
senior mechanical engineering ma­
jor. “There was some concern over two 
protests that I didn’t have the power 
to rectify, but other than those, I think 
it was a success.”
Sigma Nu sealed tenth place in the 
first roll of finals by missing the push 
bar at the end of the race. Jama’s 
disqualification was the only trans­
gression of the men’s races, as op­
posed to six from the previous year’s 
races.
Pika B set the bar at 2:14.58 in the 
second race of finals, a mark which 
neither DTD in race two, nor Spirit C 
and Beta A in race three, could chal­
lenge. After rolling to third place in 
the preliminaries, a partial spin 
slowed Beta down enough to banish 
Mercury to ninth place.
Lone Wolf set the stage in race 4 by 
posting its 2:11.04 run, and Spirit A 
came through with its winning time.
“Spirit, and also SDC who finished 
fourth, did a fantastic job,” said Theta 
Xi buggy chair Kishore Rao. “Not only 
did their buggies roll well, but they 
won with class.”
This year’s preliminaries took on 
added meaning because there were 
concerns that finals would be rained 
out, making the preliminary stand­
ings the final times. However, the 
added importance of the race wasn’t 
evident in the early heat times; it 
wasn’t until heat five that KDR A 
broke the 2:20 barrier.
“The cold ground affecting the bug­
gies and the cold air affecting the 
pushers were probably the biggest 
problems,” said Fratto.

“I think everyone went all out 
on the first day because there was 
an 80 percent chance of rain on 
Saturday,” said Yarde. “Anyone 
who didn’t go all out probably 
should have.”
Heat three did provide a his­
torical footnote to Sweepstakes 
as Pi Lambda Phi returned to 
buggy competition with the re­
vamped Legend. After a year off, 
Legend returned to roll a 2:39.54.
“We did really well, considering 
that we’re basicially a new pro­
gram,” said PiLam bugy chair 
James Huber, a sophomore H&SS 
major. “We’ll be back next year, 
and we’ll be better.”
Spirit C (Quantum Leap) turned 
up the heat in race six with a time 
of 2:15.58, but SAE A (Takoohi) 
grabbed the lead in the very next 
race. The next three heats slowed 
the pace down again as eight of 
the nine buggies ran over 2:20. 
The exception was Phi Kap A (Sec­
retariat) which was on pace for a 
front-running time in heat eight 
when it blew its left rear tire and 
crashed in the Chute.
Heats 11 and 13 focused on the
B battle between Spirit and Pika. 
Spirit’s Tachyon, coming back 
from itfe spin in the women’s pre­
liminaries, rolled a 2:13.95 to take 
the lead; Pika B CRenegade) 
shaved three-quarters of a sec­
ond off that mark to grab the lead 
two heats later.
Heat 15 began the final assault 
as the top teams started rolling. 
Beta’s Mercury dropped the lead 
time down to 2:10.64, but Pika A 
cracked that mark with a 2:08.94 
run in heat 17. There was only one 
heat in the way of a Pika win, but 
that one heat contained Spirit A, 
FRINGE A and Phi Kap B.
Coming out of the gates, Spirit 
didn’t look like they were going to 
give Pika much of a fight — Hills 
1 and 2 looked more like a 2:12 or 
2:13 roll — but things turned 
around in freeroll and on the back 
hills. This was especially evident 
in junior computer science major 
Chad Darby’s Hill Five perfor­
mance.
“It may have been [a Hill Five 
record],” said Yarde. “We didn’t 
have anyone timing it, but going 
from the race clock, he made up a 
significant amount of time on the
back hill. Thekid was really mov­
ing.”
After the main heats, three bug­
gies were awarded re-rolls. Kappa 
Sig*s B buggy rolled a 2:37.29, 
Theta Xi A rolled a 2:17.96, and 
SDC A came up with a 2:14.40. 
This took two seconds off their 
original time, and gave them sixth 
place in the preliminaries. Theta 
Xi and SDC were awarded new 
rolls because they bumped in the 
Chute; Kappa Sig received their 
re-roll because CIA’s buggy hit 
their buggy from behind.
“There was a drizzle during our 
re-roll which made the Chute 
slick, and our buggy fishtailed a 
little,” said Rao. “I’m not trying to 
make excuses, but who can say 
how things might have gone?”
The weather also played a big 
part in this year’s Sweepstakes, 
according to Fratto. “Earlier in 
the week, we were faced with the 
possibility of being the first 
Sweepstakes in history to be 
rained out,” he said. “We cut the 
time between races from nine 
minutes to seven, and we just got 
the last heat in just as the rain 
started to fall.”

Coming into the last roll of women’s 
finals, Pi Kappa Alpha faced a stiff chal­
lenge to its bid for back-to-back champi­
onships.
Little Nip, Theta Xi’s A buggy, had just 
posted a 2:39.66, a quarter of a second 
faster than its qualifying time from the 
previous day.
No problem. Renegade, Pika’s A buggy, 
breezed to a 2:35.88 finishing time to 
lock up the house’s second consecutive 
women’s championship. Spirit A finished 
a semi-distant third with a time of 
2:46.57.
“I’m sort of surprised,” said Pika buggy 
chair Dave Conley. “I was surprised that 
some people were rolling so well, and I 
was surprised that others were rolling so 
poorly.”
“I was really pleased with the way our 
women’s teams rolled,” said Theta Xi 
buggy chair Kishore Rao. “The time we 
had in finals was an organizational record 
for us. Pika did an excellent job, though. 
They rolled a really great race.”
The other three finalists were FRINGE 
A (2:47.63), Pioneers A (2:50.39), and 
ATO A (2:52.26). Turmoil, the new Pio­
neers buggy, spun in preliminaries but 
was granted a re-roll when it was de­
cided that a bump by Spirit’s Tachyon 
was the cause of the spin. Turmoil rolled

a 2:50.22 which placed it fifth and -j 
knocked FRINGE B out of the finals. i 
“We had trouble on Hill 2, so we weren’t 
rolling as fast as we’d have liked,” said ¦ 
Pioneers buggy chair Fred Bradbury. 
“Spirit caught up at the beginning of the 
Chute and tried to pass. There wasn’t 1 
enough room, so they bumped us and I 
caused the spin.”
“Our driver [junior architecture major I 
Leslie Kavchak] tried to pass between 
the hay bales and the Pioneers’ buggy, j 
and the rear wheels tied up,” said Spirit I 
buggy chair Terence Yarde. “It was a i 
gutsy move on her part because Tachyon 
was starting to pick up speed for the 
pass.”
Looking only at the standings, it 
wouldn’t have mattered if the women’s 
finals had been rained out. The top six 
finishers in preliminaries finished in the 
same order in the finals.
Spirit’s Vicious Flow started the charge 
in heat three with a time of 2:40.05, 
blowing the nearest competition of the 
first two heats out by almost 15 seconds.
After two heats of low three-minute 
times, the lead changed hands in heat 
six.
Sophomore H&SS major Kelly Ster­
ling turned what would be the second 
best Hill 1 time of the day to take care of 
the on-course competition, and Theta Xi 
turned its sights to the top of the 
scoreboard. 2:39.97 later, Little Nip was 
on top of the standings board by eight 
hundredths of a second.
The Theta Xi lead didn’t last too long, 
though. Pika, the defending champion, 
rolled in heat eight and provided a taste 
of what was to come in the finals. Pika 
ran a 2:37.31 course time, anchored by 
junior Jenni Bourque, who won the 
“Queen of Hill One” title, and the heat 9 
tie-up in the Chute sealed Pika’s top 
position for the finals.
“This year’s races were very success­
ful,” said Bradbury. “There was less con­
cern over buggies not being ready, and it 
was overall a pretty safe weekend.”
Rao promised that Theta Xi would be 
back next year. “We’re going to have all 
our A and B pushers coming back next 
year, and we’ll have the kinks worked 
out of our new buggy,” he said. “I think 
we could look toward two of the top six 
buggies next year.”
Pika’s roll in the finals came very close 
to beating the women’s record of2:35.66, 
which Pika set in last year’s victory.

The Game: The player tried to
throw small witch dolls into the 
oven or a small cauldron. To win 
a handful of candy, two witches 
had to be baked, or one boiled. 
The choice was entirely up to the 
player.

The Booth: The noncompetitive 
booth was a small black structure 
with a periscope inside. Coming 
up from the floor was large plastic 
tubing resembling the inside of a 
submarine.
The Game: The game originally 
involved a torpedo shoot. How­
ever, due to technical difficulties, 
the torpedo shoot was replaced by 
concentration, a memorizing and 
matching game. When asked how 
the booth will be handled next 
year, Booth Chair Nick Harrigan 
said, “We’re going to get some­
thing that works and that people 
will come into, not run away from.”

The Booth: Spirit’s theme was
chosen because “we realized that 
Alice Walker was a renowned 
black female author and that a lot 
of people had seen the movie and 
would understand the theme,” 
said Jameel Alkhafiz, booth chair. 
The noncompetitive booth took 
about two weeks to build, since 
Spirit used a pre-existing frame. 
The mural that served as a back­
ground for “Shug’s Place” was cre­
ated by Troy Johnson, a junior 
design major.
The Game: The game consisted 
of throwing rings over bottles. If
the players succeeded, they were shots on goal. The chair was Rich

we had decent plans early on.”
The Game: PiLam’s game was remi­

started at the top level and maneu­

“Our game fits well with the theme. 
You have to use logic and skill.”

The Booth: Sigma Nu’s plain white 
booth was decorated on the inside 
with pictures of fish and other 
aquatic animals. According to Brent 
Was, booth chair, the theme was 
picked because, “It was a water- 
related idea. It’s a tradition to give
away goldfish as prizes so we look 
for a theme with water.”
The Game: The patrons of this

Day in the Life
Carnival — it’s not 
all fun and games
.owry Burgess, Dean of CFA — would you want this guy to judge your booth?
Ignatius Sasmita/Tärtan Contributing Editor
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Contributing Editor
To most people, Carnival is one of the 
most fun times of the year at Carnegie 
Mellon. However, underneath the 
amusment lies a lot of hard work. This 
weekend I set out to explore Carnival 
from a behind-the-scenes view.
7:15 am. Friday’s buggy races served 
as a natural starting point, so I decided 
to tag along with the Radio Club to see 
just what it takes to supervise 27 buggy 
runs. Besides, their scaffolding offered 
the best view of the race course.
This was also sort of a special occasion 
because, thanks to three cameras (Hill 2, 
the Chute, finish line) and a borrowed 
FCC license, the Radio Club was run­
ning television coverage of this year’s 
Sweepstakes.
“We’ve beenhere all night,” said senior 
ECE major Pete Skelly, “but everything 
seems to be up and running.”
7:30 am. I tailed Radio Club Station 
Manager Tad Dockstader, a sophomore 
mechanical engineering major, to a rules 
meeting involving Sweepstakes Chair 
Ray Fratto and the body of buggy chair­
men. The rules regarding the brake test 
and handling of buggies were the major 
topics of discussion. Fratto wasn’t in a 
very festive mood this morning, but what 
should I expect? After all, there were still 
about seven cars on the buggy course, 
and there was always rain to worry about.
Dockstader talked to Fratto after the 
meeting about getting copies of the pa­
rade permits. “After all, they’re City of 
Pittsburgh streets we’re closing off,” said 
Dockstader. I assumed that the Radio 
Club people didn’t want to have to hunt 
down Fratto if there was a problem with 
the permits.
8:09 am. I stopped by WRCT briefly to 
see how their race-day plans were going. 
According to Sports Director Jack Kirr, a 
junior ECE major, “things seem to go in 
spurts. One minute it looks like we’re 
running behind, and other times we’re 
doing just fine.” As it turned out, WRCT 
ran smoothly after a few problems in the 
early women’s heats.
8:20 am. The issue was once again the 
closing of the course. I was back at Net 
Control, Radio Club’s command center 
on the Hill 2 scaffolding, when the sched­
uling conflict arose. Sweepstakes per­
sonnel ordered the course closed at 8:15 
while the police and Radio Club had

chairperson's expres­
sion when he or she

coming to the booth.
orders to let traffic through until 8:35. 
After a six-minute course closing created 
a long queue of cars, the course was 
reopened for fifteen more minutes.
9:20 am. Races were well under way, 
and I’d begun to pick up the Radio Club 
procedure. Each of the seven checkpoints 
— starting line, Westinghouse, Panther 
Hollow, Monument, Chute, Scaife, and 
Baker — reported back to Control as 
each of the buggies passed them, and 
notified Control if any of the buggies 
spun out. It was actually a pretty im­
pressive system, but it broke down later 
in the races when a couple of the radio 
operators had to leave. I guess that’s 
what happens when things start late.
2:30 pm. After the races were over and 
I had some lunch, I headed over to Mid­
way to do some more of my would-be 
investigative reporting. I tracked down 
Midway Chair Meg Veily, one of the 
busier people on campus.
However, this was one of the slower 
times for Veily. “The really busy parts for 
me are Monday when the booths come 
over, [Thursday] during final inspections, 
and cleanup on Sunday,” she said. “Right 
now, I’m just taking care of a lot of little 
things.”
3 pm. As exciting as an afternoon of 
“little things” sounded, I passed it up to 
hangaroundwiththeboothjudgingcom- . 
mittee when it went on its tour of the 
Midway. After a meeting to discuss the 
judging procedure—many of the judges 
were first-timers — we went out to take 
a look at the booths.
If you ever get a chance, it’s a lot of fun 
to watch a booth chairperson’s expres­
sion when he or she sees the judges 
coming to the booth. Each booth chair got 
seven minutes to explain/sell their booth 
to the committee, and it was interesting

Carnival draws a varied audience
ly AUSON GREEN
nartari Magazine Editor
Everything about Carnival — 
he booths, the rides, the buggy 
aces -7- attracts a diverse audi- 
nce. Alumni, parents, faculty, 
ollege! and high school students, 
randparents, and children con- 
erge on one spot and create the 
xcitement and commotion for 
/hich Carnival is so well known. 
According to Sarah Wise and 
ennifer Ludwig, two students 
roin Woodland Hills High School, 
eople ¡at local high schools were 
alkinf* about Carnival for weeks 
efore the event. “This is the first 
ear I’ve come here,” said Wise. “I 
ke the crowd.”
Corie Yonas, an elementary 
chool $tudent from Edgewood, is 
Carnjival veteran. “This is my 
lird ti[me,” said Yonas. “It looks 
ke on4 of the better years.” Yonas 
)oks forward to Carnival every 
ear, and this year was no excep- 
on. “]\i[y brother was [a student] 
' ere for a year, and I heard more 
bout i( from my friends at school. 
Je tallj: about it and look forward 
>it.” !
Lots of local families came with 
ìeir children. Nick Andrianos 
ves in Oakland, and has been 
ringing his son Theodore to Car- 
ival for years now. “We just came
ten minutes ago,” said Andrianos, 
“and we just dunked a guy [in the 
CMU Swim team booth].”
The anticipation on campus is 
close to maddening. “Carnival is 
a time to stay out nine days, blow 
off many assignments and classes, 
and try to prove that people at 
CMU have a life,” said Pioneers’ 
Booth Chair Bill Cheeseman, 
who’s a junior Mechanial Engi­
neer.
Jenni Severa, an English doc­
toral student who worked in the 
information tent, enjoyed watch­
ing the transformation of the cam­
pus as Carnival approached. 
“Sunday night, it’s just campus. 
On Monday, booths are going up, 
and everybody forgets about 
school for a while.”
Of course, the anticipation can 
accelerate to a frantic pace. “It’s a 
time of sustained self-abuse,” said 
senior ECE Marquet Anderson, 
who worked on the Pioneers booth. 
“You don’t sleep, you don’t eat, 
and if you do eat, everything tastes 
like sawdust and paint.”
Some groups, like Kappa Sigma, 
spent less time on their booths to 
preserve their sanity. “[Carnival] 
is a lot of fun, a break from the 
schoolwork. It brings the house 
together. We don’t want to overdo 
things,” said junior IM major Lou 
Yonke, a brother at Kappa Sigma
who worked in their booth during 
Carnival. “I think a lot of these 
booths are overdone.”
For most students, however, 
Carnival is a time to relax. “Car­
nival means relieving stress by 
putting effort towards something 
other than school, something you 
enjoy rather than something you 
have to do,” saidjunior math major 
Phil “Goose” Marino, who was in 
charge of security for Carnival.
Sophomore psychology major 
John McGoldrick also feels that 
Carnival is an upbeat time. “I 
think [CMU] should promote fun 
time a little more. Everyone gets 
into [Carnival] — organizations, 
fraternities, sororities ... it’s nice 
to see everyone put their efforts 
into this.” Senior psychology ma­
jor Jon Schwartz described Car­
nival as “the one period of sponta­
neity in the entire year at CMU.” 
Paul Martin, who graduated 
from CMU last year (applied his­
tory), enjoyed coming back dur­
ing Carnival. “Having not really 
left the Pittsburgh scene, it’s not 
as much of a homecoming as it is 
for other alumni. It’s good to have 
the chance to see old friends at a 
better time of the year.”
Parents of students also enjoyed 
seeing the campus at its best. “My 
son is a junior,” said Bernd 
Mrusek. “This is my third carni­
val. I’m always intrigued by the 
imagination [involved with the 
construction] of the booths. 
They’re very clever.” Margaret 
Gregory from Ligonier has a niece 
who is a student here. “We came 
with our grandchild, you know, 
especially for him. He’s hitting all 
the booths.”
Even though they were work­
ing most of the time during Car­
nival, Physical Plant electricians 
John Zitelli and Ken Donnelly 
took the time to have a funnel 
cake. “It’s fun,” said Zitelli. Have 
they enjoyed the fruits of their 
labor? “No,” said Zitelli, “we 
haven’t ridden the rides.”
Of course, some people would 
have appreciated warmer 
weather. “I wish it were warmer,” 
said Karen Ross, who lives nearby 
and brought her daughter to Car­
nival. Earl McDonald also com­
mented on the weather. “Basi­
cally, I’m having a really good 
time. But it’s really cold.” 
History professor Eugene Levy 
summed up Carnival and CMU 
in these few succinct lines. “I’ve 
been here 25 years; world events 
have come and gone, but [Carni­
val] hasn’t really changed. Maybe 
it means that CMU students will 
always be CMU students no mat­
ter what happens, at least for a 
couple of days.”
Josh Freeman/Photo Staff Manager 
Nick Andrianos and his son Theodore have been coming to Carnival for 
several years.

Comedian Marty Putz meets his match
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
“I’ll kill you all!” vowed come­
dian Marty Putz, amidst a bois­
terous crowd in an over-packed 
Carnival tent. He waggled a plas­
tic suction dart gun and just 
dodged in time as a marshmallow 
— one of many he distributed to 
the audience minutes before — 
whizzed past his head.
With a grimace of determina­
tion, Putz spun about, and, after 
a few seconds of rummaging 
through the large assortment of 
props onstage with him, returned 
with a three-foot-long plastic ba­
zooka. This he unceremoniously 
emptied at his assailants in the 
audience, buffeting them with 
marshmallows. Twenty minutes 
later Ke rebutted a similar mis­
sile with a volley from an onstage 
catapult.
Why comedy is becoming in­
creasingly like tribal warfare is 
beyond the speculative capacities
of the average man, but the aver­
age man could also care less, pre­
ferring instead to sit back and 
enjoy the ferocious revelry. A 
comedian’s position of power is 
delicate — he must maintain a 
constant vigil of extroverted arro­
gance, for one unanswered jeer 
from the audience could spell his 
doom.
Putz knew all the tricks. Within 
minutes of his introduction, he 
had singled out hapless crowd

emous echoes or guttural boom­
ing. Trying to roll with the punch 
the best lie could, Putz attempted 
to integrate the unexpected vocal 
effects into his act — while a few 
AB technicians behind the sound 
system snickered gleefully.
Putz was highly interactive with 
his audience, but not solely as an 
antagonist. One embarrassed girl 
found herself pressed against his 
back, her arms wedged under his 
armpits, forced to play the part of 
his hands during an episode he 
loudly narrated. Another student 
was charged with the task of 
catching an airborne stuffed cat 
with a large safety net mounted 
on a cumbersome full-face hel-
met.
Putz was prolific with his props. 
From giant condoms to “Califor­
nia party hats” that sprouted Coke 
cans in all directions, he evoked 
waves of violent laughter with his 
collection of toys. Particularly 
memorable was his lip-synch per­
formance of Elvis, wherein his 
suit gradually inflated to obesity.
The audience contributed to the 
performance as much as they 
watched it. By the end of the show, 
Putz had formed several rituals 
with the audience, and created so 
many inside jokes within the con­
text of the performance that you 
couldn’t help but feel as if you 
were sharing something oddly 
personal with this raving, obnox­
ious clown.

By WASEEM HUSSAIN
Vartan Senior Staffwriter
Overlooked because of stormy 
weather; Spring Carnival’s most 
uplifting exhibit caught the at­
tention of a select few students 
and alumni who made their way 
through the buggy crowds and 
into the gym. There, one would 
have seen a retroshiek tent — 
looking like something from 
Lawrence of Arabia — looming 
large like a baby whale, covering 
half of the gym floor, and sur­
rounded by humming generators 
pumping gallons of air to keep it 
alive. The walls were covered with 
fishing nets, and inside the bow­
els of this great green and blue 
beast were people laughing, yell­
ing, screaming, and keeping score. 
Enter the world of Airball!
Special events chairman Frank 
DeVito, a senior policy & man­
agement major, described Airball 
as being, “basically indoor volley­
ball in a netting-like area played 
on an inflatable mattress.” The 
game was much like volleyball 
except for a few interesting ex­
ceptions.
The ball itself was filled with 
air, much like a beach ball. There 
were no boundaries as Airball was 
played in an inflatable cage. Any­
one can score no matter who was 
serving, and the same player can 
hit the ball as many times as they 
want.
Essentially, Airball most closely 
represented volleyball without the
rules!
Brian Mellow, who travelled 
several hundred miles from Mas­
sachusetts to bring Airball to 
Carnegie Mellon, emphasized 
that the point of the game is to 
“equalize everyone’s skill level so 
no one will dominate the game.”
Indeed, in Airball, everyone 
playing had the flexibility to play 
at the Olympic or Michael Jorda­
nian level. The elation of flight, 
the security of diving onto a soft 
mattress, and the power of know­
ing that in this little piece of 
heaven there are no limits was 
throughly intoxicating. For 
awhile, the people of Carnegie 
Mellon let go and became kids 
again.
Camival-goers expressed such
joyous sentiments as “it was fun,” 
“sweaty,” and “kudos!” at this lat­
est milestone in Carnival history. 
Were it not for the weather, the 
inflatable tent cage would have 
been sitting on the Cut for all to 
see and enjoy.
But alas, Airball action, mired 
in the background of a cloudy 
spring day in the concrete prison 
that is the CMU gym, was en­
joyed by a select few who went 
digging for the buried treasure of 
Spring Carnival 1991.

Carnival Profile
V y
Each year, the entire CMU 
campus eagerly awaits the ar­
rival of Carnival — a three-day 
party at which people from all 
departments and organizations 
come together.
They engage in friendly but 
serious competition in buggy 
and booth, forget about home­
work by taking a few turns on 
the SkyDiver, and de-stress 
with the help of bands, comedi­
ans, and lots of funnel cake.
Behind all these festivities are 
the often-unsung heroes — in­
dividuals who put in endless 
hours of hard work and plan­
ning all year round to make 
Carnival possible.
These are the people who 
carry out such tasks as closing 
off the streets for buggy, pur­
chasing the trophies, organiz­
ing the entertainment, or sup­
plying electrical power for the 
Midway. Without them, Carni­
val simply would not happen.
Here, then, are some profiles 
of the people that are the back­
bone of Carnival.

Position:' Chairman of the 
Sweepstakes Committee 
Experience: Fratto was Assis­
tant Sweepstakes Chairman 
for two years prior to ascend­
ing to his current position. 
Responsibilities: Fratto was 
the general overseer respon­
sible Sweepstakes. He was in 
charge of organizing the par­
ticipating buggy groups, su­
pervising the buggy free-rolls, 
insuring that everyone has 
the proper permits, inform­
ing the campus about buggy 
events, and more. “I like Car­
nival a lot,” Fratto admitted. 
Glancing at the midway, he 
added, “It’s nice getting over 
here and seeing what the 
other side does. We’re pretty 
much secluded... in our buggy 
world over there.”

Major: IM 
Year: Junior
Position: Rides Chairman 
Experience: Ewedosh was in 
charge of opening and closing 
ceremonies onlastyear’s Car­

Responsibilities: Those mon­
strous whirling machines of 
death that dominate half the 
midway aren’t all fun and 
games, and it was Ewedosh’s 
job to handle the administra­
tive end of the rides. He served 
as a liaison to the ride ven­
dors, assisting them with con­
tracting, scheduling, setting 
up, ticket sales, and their 
other needs. “Carnival’s go­
ing really well,” he remarked, 
“I’m really excited by the en­
ergy people put into it.”

Responsibilities: Gerwig is 
the across-the-board right 
hand man of Carnival, hand­
ling the miscellany of secre­
tarial jobs that naturally 
comes about with such a com­
plicated series of activities. “I 
make sure everyone gets 
paid,” Gerwig summarized 
wryly. “I make arrangements 
for entertainment, the per­
formances, the food... and all 
that paperwork.” She got the 
cashboxes for the vendors, T- 
shirt distributors, and other 
financial parties involved in 
the festivities as well. Despite 
her host of responsibilities, 
Marcia maintained that Car­
nival is “big-time fun.”

Local barmaids harass d’Artegan’s faithful companion Random, played

By TERRI KASCH
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
As usual during Carnival, there 
was a whole lot more going on 
than just rides, booth and buggy. 
One of the other activities that 
appears every carnival is Scotch 
TSF Soda’s biggest production. The 
students involved in Scotch *N’ 
Soda worked since last fall to bring 
the adventure d’Artegan: A Re­
quiem to the Ballroom.
d’Artegan starred CIT freshman 
Thomas Beaulieu, a newcomer to 
Scotch ‘N’ Soda, as the title char­
acter Sir Philip d’Artegan. 
d’Artegan has been told that he 
has of three months to live and 
decides to sail the globe in search 
of an honorable and heroic death. 
He offers 50,000 pounds to any­
one brave enough to sail with him. 
His uptight assistant Random, 
played by senior English major 
Michael T. Rose, grudgingly as­
sists him with his plan.
The pair find Morgan the Red 
(H&SS freshman Elizabeth L. 
Chambers) and her notorious crew 
as companions. They also man­
age to pick up a mysterious 
stranger named Jon (senior En­
glish major David Randolph 
Gross).
Off they go to various exotic 
shores, eventually landing in 
Arethusula, where they meet the 
Empress Lystrada (H&SS fresh­
man Christy M. Moore) and her 
bizarre right-hand man Karthas 
(H&SS sophomore Paul Knag). 
The voyagers, especially d’Art­
egan, all learn a little bit more 
about themselves before taking 
leave of this unusual place where 
no one ever dies and boredom is 
their most formidable foe.
Beaulieu made a memorable 
debut as Sir Philip. His rich voice 
and regal air came together to 
create a wonderful d’Artegan. 
Look for his name in future Scotch 
‘N’ Soda productions. You won’t 
be disappointed.
Rose was the perfect comple­
ment to Beaulieu as the slightly 
hysterical Random. While the 
overall theme of the musical was 
solemn, Rose grabbed big laughs 
in this charming role. Knag Was 
another source of comic relief as 
the sexually disturbed Karthas. 
He played up the character’s 
quirks beautifully, showing the 
audience that he was having a
great time.
Chambers gave an appropri­
ately tough performance as Mor­
gan the Red, the infamous and 
brutal captain who prefers to keep 
her identity a secret. Chambers 
seemed right at home up there 
dancing, shoving and fighting 
through their adventures.
Moore and Gross as Empress 
Lystrada and Death (otherwise 
known as Jon) were a remarkable 
team. The two have an under­
standably bitter relationship 
since Death has been banished 
from Arethusula.
The two actors not only played 
off of each other nicely in each 
scene but their vibrant singing 
gave their haunting songs a fresh 
sound.
As Brassatio, Morgan the Red’s 
first mate, sophomore mechani­
cal engineer Jon Walsh breathed 
life into his swarthy character. 
Brassatio is not your typical pi­
rate and Walsh took advantage of 
Brassatio’s unusual habits which 
included joyously reciting poetry 
he wrote.
Director Javier Grillo- 
Marxuach, a senior English ma­
jor, turned this show into some­
thing you wouldn’t want to miss. 
The action-packed staging kept 
the audience alert and interested 
and both the cast as well as the 
the audience seemed to be having 
a blast.
H&SS sophomore Christian 
Matyi and Gross brought some 
intense choreography to the stage. 
Nearly every number was filled 
with students dancing their 
hearts out. The choreography was 
both inspired and energetic and 
any applause the cast received 
must be shared with these two.
This show also had an unbeat­
able team of writers. Kevin and 
Chris Thomas (both senior En­
glish majors) and Michael Cuccaro 
(senior mechanical engineer) are 
responsible for the fascinating, 
tale, while Musical Director 
Michael Walker (IM sophomore) 
and Assistant Director Mick 
Sutter (junior English major) with 
the help of several other students, 
wrote the delightful score.
Kudos to all of them for a job 
well done. For those of you who 
missed the show, there is always 
next year. But that’s small conso­
lation, since d’Artegan won’t be 
gracing the stage again.
Follow Carnival’s long and traditional past
lirc(fIo Ehzg ustw yy
ajid eyery spring a new link was 
aflded for each freshman class. In 
tftosedays, freshmen were under 
special regulations, and the Chain 
was "part of a ceremony called 
Qualification Day that initiated 
tnem as full members of Carnegie 
Techv As Carnival grew to become 
ttye main spring event, the Chain 
wjas^dded to its festivities.
¡Tlje Friday during Carnival 
became known as “Heyday,” and
* parade was added to Carnival’s 
makeup. Organizations created 
floats that were judged and 
awarded prizes. Also, the choos­
ing of a “Carnival Queen” contin- 
u£d;$o be an important part of
people had more serious things to 
worry about. In 1943, the last link 
was added to the Carnegie Chain, 
after which it was forgotten. Even 
Buggy races were dropped tem­
porarily, because of the scarcity 
of materials.
In 1947, however, the first big 
“post-war” Carnival was held, in­
cluding Buggy, Scotch ‘N’ Soda, 
and a Midway, which had become 
an important part of the tradi­
tion. Ballroom dances were held 
with big bands like Tommy Dorsey 
and his orchestra.
In the 1950s, a faculty egg- 
throwing contest was introduced, 
which became so popular that it 
was continued for some time. The
traditions of dances, floats, and 
Carnival Queens continued, but 
became less “hallowed” over the 
years. In 1970, students wrote to 
The Tartan facetiously suggest­
ing a write-in vote for Richard 
King Mellon as Carnival Queen, 
and by the next year “Queens” 
had been phased out completely. 
That year saw the advent of less 
sedate activities, including the 
Frisbee Tournament and the Pa­
per Airplane Contest.
Like many Carnival activities, 
those did not endure. Traditions 
are fickle, as the Carnegie Chain
could tell you, and few have lasted 
to become a part of the most re­
cent celebrations, including last 
weekend’s “From Cover to Cover.” 
Included with the time-honored 
Buggy, Midway, and Scotch ‘N’ 
Soda are new high-tech events 
like “Air Ball” and the Laser Show. 
One thing has survived, however: 
the idea that students at this fast- 
paced school can put computers 
and canvasses aside for a week­
end and put all of their effort into 
activities that might not be di­
rectly applicable to a professional 
career, but are frivolously fun.
1HJ938, the annual play, which 
had been performed by drama 
students, was turned over to 
Scotch‘N’ Soda, and Carnival con­
tinued to change slowly toward 
its present form.
During World War II, Carnival 
was curtailed severely. Atten­
dance at Carnegie Tech had 
dropped drastically, the economy

Major: Mechanical Engineer­
ing
Year: Senior
Position: Technical Produc­
tions Coordinator
Experience: Lynn has had his 
position for three years.
Responsibilities: Lynn and 
the rest of AB Tech coordi­
nated many of the technical 
aspects of Carnival, includ­
ing power distribution, sound 
and lighting, contract man­
agement for the comedians 
and entertainers, and special 
events like the Laser Show. 
With the exception of the rain, 
Josh found that Carnival 
went “very smoothly” — no 
casual comment from some­
one who was responsible for 
handling every glitch or tech­
nical problem that arouse.
Name: Mike Holling 
Major: Computer Science 
Year: Junior
Position: Power Chairman 
Experience: Holling was As­
sistant Power Chairman at 
last year’s Carnival. 
Responsibilities: If there’s 
one thing which Carnival eats 
up a lot of, it’s electricity, and 
Holling’s job was to see that 
the power needs of the vari­
ous games, rides, and activi­
ties were all attended to. Mo­
tivated by his interest in elec­
tronics, Holling played tech­
nician and troubleshooter for 
the hundreds of people who 
rely on his services. “They’re 
all pretty good,” Mike re­

bling booths. “Although some 
of them are different than I 
thought they might be.”

Year: Sophomore 
Position: Assistant Power

Responsibilities: Yeck was 
the assistant Power Coordi­
nator, and had to assume the 
responsibilities of Mike 
Holling when he was off-duty. 
Yeck also handled the recy­
cling of lumber and materials 
after Carnival’s over. “I think 
[Carnival’s] going really 
smoothly,” observed Mark. “I 
think it was planned out a lot 
better this year.”

Responsibilities: Witchner 
coordinated the major activi­
ties of Carnival, and has only 
recently shifted the scope of 
her duties towards the buggy 
aspect. “We’re made strong 
efforts to make sure Carnival 
is safe,” she emphasized. “As 
to entertainment, we try to 
have diverse things going on 
without too much repetition.”

Spring Carnival rides provide fun, nausea
Name: Mark Patrick 
Major: Math/Operations Re­
search 
Year: Senior
Position: Carnival Chairman 
Experience: Patrick was Co- 
Chairman of Entertainment 
at last year’s Carnival. 
Responsibilities: Just about 
everything in the parking lot 
and tents fell under Patrick’s 
jurisdiction — he headed the 
22-person Carnival Commit­
tee, the student body that ran 
every aspect of CMU’s yearly 
gala. His duties included man­
aging rides, entertainment, 
and publicity. Despite the 
burden of his myriad respon­
sibilities, Patrick found this 
year relatively disaster-free. 
“Everything’s been going so 
smoothly. We’re just waiting 
for something to happen.” He 
attributed Carnival’s favor­
able progress to the diligence 
ofhis underlings and co-work­
ers. ‘Everyone’s been doing a 
—great job.”
Name: Meg Veily
Major: Policy & Management
Year: Junior
Position: Midway Chairman 
Experience: Veily was Assis­
tant Midway Chairman in 
1989 — which set the prece­
dent for the use of the Skibo 
parking lot—as well as Mid­
way Chairman last year. 
Responsibilities: Veily was re­
sponsible for managingmany 
aspects of a hectic and active 
midway, and served as a cen­
tral coordinator for the booth- 
building organizations. She 
handled the contractual pa­
perwork involved with the 
booths, and keept the build­
ers informed of relevant rules 
and information. “Ithinkthis 
midway is one of the most 
impressive I’ve seen,” said 
Veily. “The booths are getting 
bigger, the booths are getting 
fancier... they’re just getting 
more impressive.”
By MICHAEL T. ROSE
Tartan Contributing Editor
Some say that Carnival is an 
opportunity for campus organi­
zations to compete against one 
another, to show the world what 
dedication, inspiration, and sleep 
deprivation can achieve. Others 
contend that Carnival is better 
viewed as an “alumni weekend,” 
where students present and stu­
dents past renew their ties.
We know better. The heart of 
Carnival is not the midway, nor is 
it the buggy course—in my mind, 
the heart of Carnival is clearly 
the comer of the Skibo parking 
lot where J&J Amusements sets 
up shop. There’s something es­
sentially collegiate about the 
whole notion of artificially-in- 
ducedmption sickness; something 
that draws normally rational 
people to repeatedly hurl them­
selves through the air at high 
speed.
Rides Chair Michael Ewedosh 
told me that once the Carnival 
date is set; the selection of rides is 
entirely in the hands of the tour- 
ingride company. J &J owner John 
1 Richardson schedules individual 
\ attractions to come to CMU as 
! they fit in with J&J’s 28-week 
summer touring plans, and as 
they fit in with the post-parking 
garage Skibo lot (the latter hav­
ing more limited ride space than 
was availably for past Carnivals).
Although some notable favor­
ites — the bumper cars and the 
infamous Gravitron — did not 
put in an appearance this year, 
the rides that did make it were on 
the whole sufficiently terrifying, 
to wit:
• “Sea Ray.” This nautically- 
themed swinging ship was the 
first ride I tried, and I nervously 
asked the operator — a three- 
year J&J veteran named Ed 
Hatch—whether he’d ever lost a
yÙyrnival Profile
question and said, “Depends — 
some people don’t like heights, 
some don’t like to go upside down.” 
Russell also told me that after 
J&J’s collection of 65 rides fin­
ishes its winter hibernation in 
Springfield, Ohio, the company is 
on the road doing an average of 
two appearances a week for the 
entire season.
• “Flying Bobs.” I have a seri­
ous problem with the Flying Bobs 
ride; somehow, I always seem to 
get a non-swinging car. This year 
was no different. I hurled around 
the ski-scene-decorated spindle 
over and over again, all the time 
fuming as the occupants of the 
cars around me swayed and swung 
with abandon. It’s a plot of some 
sort.
• “SuperLoops.” I enjoyed this 
ride the most, although it was

Incidentally, Dean of Student Affairs Mike Murphy also 
lost his keys when he went riding on Thursday afternoon, 
which just goes to show that he and I have more in com­
mon than just the same first name and the same sunny 
outlook on life.
rider. He laughed. “No,” he said, 
“people just get sick, that’s all.”
Forewarned, I tried to ignore 
the twitching in my stomach that 
arose as the ship began its pendu­
lum rolls. I had hoped that by 
fixing my gaze on the pirate man­
nequin at the wheel I might avoid 
the onset of nausea, but it didn’t 
work very well — I must have 
turned a lovely shade of green, 
because the women sitting oppo­
site me conveyed by a combina­
tion of shouts and sign language 
their desire that I should attempt 
to vomit in some other direction.
Despite this encouragement, I 
managed to finish the Sea Ray 
with my lunch and my dignity 
intact.
• The Ferris wheel. Like most 
of us, I recollect the romantic im­
ages of Ferris wheels; couples 
smooching as the massive wooden 
contraption revolves lazily in the 
air of a summer night. Well, this 
is not that kind of Ferris wheel. 
The small steel J&J wheel re­
volved so fast that the downward 
trip was accompanied by the float- 
ing-stomach feeling usually asso­
ciated with roller coasters, and 
my companion and I barely had 
time for a quick smooch during a 
moment’s pause at the top of the 
ride. Still, the. view was good.
J&J Rides Superintendent Ron 
Russell told me that the Ferris 
wheel was reconditioned this year; 
that explains the speed. When 
asked which ride he thought was 
the scariest, Russell pondered the
slightly claustrophobic; the safety 
bar is an enormous stuffed vinyl 
cylinder, and the car is scarcely 
wide enough for two sets of aver­
age-sized hips. The SuperLoops 
ride, in principle, is a Ferris wheel 
turned inside out — except that 
the SuperLoops car doesn’t spin 
to orient its passengers with re­
spect to the earth, and as a result 
much of the ride is spent sitting 
on one’s head. As uncomfortable 
as this sounds, it’s actually quite 
restful. After a series of forward 
spins, the ride starts backward, 
and you get the unusual experi­
ence of gazing at campus from a 
completely unfamiliar perspec­
tive. I never knew that there were 
pigeons nesting on the Skibo roof.
• “SkyDiver.” The Whole prob­
lem with the ’Diver is its innocent 
appearance. Like the SuperLoops

The Flying Bobs — a ride designed to entertain and excite, or some 
master plot? You decide.
and the Ferris wheel, it is basi­
cally a vertically-revolving ride; 
unlike the SuperLoops, however, 
it looks enough like a regular 
Ferris wheel that some unsus­
pecting riders might be taken by 
surprise.
While a Ferris wheel’s cars ro­
tate on the same axis as the main 
wheel, the SkyDiver’s cars rotate 
around the circumference of the 
wheel on axes perpendicular to 
the main axis. All this to say that 
the SkyDiver makes you do the 
work, via a small “steering wheel,”

that gravity does on a Ferris wheel 
— keeping the car upright. I ad­
vise that SkyDiver riding pairs 
get to know each other well before 
boarding, as my partner and I 
discovered rapidly that we had 
very different thresholds of dizzi­
ness.
While I was distracted by the 
sight of the ride base zooming 
towards my upside-down head at 
umpteen miles per hour, my keys 
managed to slip from my pocket 
and lodge themselves comfortably 
on the then-bottom of the car (also 
known as the roof). I managed to 
wrestle the sneaky little guys to 
the genuine bottom of the car and 
eventually was able to retrieve 
them at the end of the ride. Inci­
dentally, Dean of Student Affairs 
Mike Murphy also lost his keys 
when he went riding on Thursday 
afternoon, which just goes to show 
that he and I have more in com­
mon than just the same first name 
and the same sunny outlook on 
life.

know why, but I have a particular

to see how different groups 
handled their time in the spot­
light. Some groups stuck more to 
the craftsmanship of their booths, 
while others practically bullied 
the committee members into play­
ing the games inside. The great­
est struggle in the presentation 
venue came when the Kappa 
Kappa Gamma spokesperson 
tried valiantly to explain Douglas 
Adams’ The Restaurant at the 
End Of the Universe to the com­
mittee members. It confused me, 
and I've read the book.
Watching President Mehrabian 
in action was the high point of the 
afternoon; he took to the task of 
judging the booths like a fish takes 
to water. Besides which, seeing 
the president of my university 
wandering Midway with a pink 
balloon tied to his jacket is just 
one of those things that changes 
your whole perception of the 
world. Unfortunately, around 5:20 
pm, I finally had to bail out, mostly 
because my feet were killing me.
Saturday, 4:30 pm. I started 
my second day of research by 
tracking down Campus Police Ser­
geant William Ricci. I was going 
to wander around Midway with 
him and see what sort of stuff 
Campus Police had to do during 
Carnival. Unfortunately, Ricci 
had to leave, so I decided to come 
back later in the evening.

6 pm. I went to the Pioneers 
booth to see what running a booth 
was like. I quickly came to the 
conclusion that it was really, re­
ally boring. You seem to stand 
around doing nothing a lot of the 
time. In the particular case of Dr. 
Seuss, you also spend a lot of time 
tryingto find the rubber fish when 
the game players miss the plate.

charge of nachos were sitting ; 
around watching the paint peel 
while the funnel cake crew was 
scurrying like mice. It didn’t seem 
to be a whole lot of fun.
8:39 pm. I finally gave up and 
packed it up for the evening. Af­
ter all, I now had just over an 
hour to enjoy Carnival 1991 be­
fore it closed for good. For a vaca­
tion, Carnival’s a hell of a lot, of ' 
work.

Carnival Profile
Name: Bonnie Gorman 
Occupation: Assistant Direc­
tor of Student Activities 
Position: Overseer of Carnival 
Committee.
Experience: Gorman’s been 
" working Carnival for two 
years.
Responsibilities: Gorman 
worked with Anne Witchner 
in directing the overall mass 
of Carnival events. As super­

well,” she beamed. “The stu­
dents are doing a great job.”
Name: Bill Ricci 
Occupation: Sergeant and Shift 
Commander of CMU police 
Position: Sweepstakes/Police Co­
ordinator 
Experience: This was Ricci’s sev­
enth year working with Sweep­
stakes.
Responsibilities: Ricci was the 
keystone between Sweepstakes 
and the CMU and Pittsburgh 
Police. It was his job to keep the 
tumultuous buggy races safe 
and trouble-free. “I always en­
joy Carnival,” he reflected, 
“There’s been a good coopera­
tive effort... it seems like a good 
event.”
Name: Brian Papa 
Major: Mechanical Engineering 
Year: Sophomore 
Position: Co-Technical Produc­
tions Chairman 
Experience: This was Papa’s 
first year on the Carnival Com­
mittee, although he unofficially 
contributed to last year’s event. 
Responsibilities: Papa worked 
with Josh Lynn to insure that 
the technical aspects of the vari­
ous shows and performances at 
Carnival went over without a 
glitch. Papa organized the vari­
ous mini-concerts at the Corner 
Stage and the Tent, such as the 
Dixieland Flyers and the Mark 
Eddy Trio. “It hasn’t been rain­
ing every day,” observed Papa 
charitably of the weather, “We 
haven’t been soaked. Buggy 
went off well... I’m happy.”
Name: Christie Johnson 
Major: Technical Writing 
Year: Junior
Position: Assistant Sweep­
stakes Chairman 
Experience: Last year John­
son was a “youngster” — a 
junior assistant on the Sweep­

Responsibilities: Johnson ran 
the free-roll buggy practices, 
supervised sweepers and 
flaggers and generally made 
sure the process ran as 
smoothly as possible. “It’s nice 
to go out on the midway,” she 
commented. “We’re so busy 
with buggy we just don’t get 
much chance to see what’s 
going on out there.”
