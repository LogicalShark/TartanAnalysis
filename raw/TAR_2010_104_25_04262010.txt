Staffwriter
When faculty members 
leave Carnegie Mellon, it is 
often instructive to reflect 
on what they’ve achieved 
throughout their tenure at the 
university. Indira Nair, who 
will be retiring from her posi­
tion as vice provost for educa­
tion after 32 years of service 
at Carnegie Mellon, is no ex­
ception.
Nair was born in Trivan­
drum, Kerala in southern 
India. Since her father was 
a member of the army, she 
moved a total of 10 times be­
fore completing 12 years of 
education. She attended the

Pittsburgh welcomes regional conference
PATRICK GAGE KELLEY
Contributing Editor
Carnegie Mellon and the 
University of Pittsburgh co­
hosted the National Associa­
tion of Graduate-Professional 
Students (NAGPS) Northeast 
Regional Conference this past 
weekend. The conference was 
a meeting of schools in the re­
gion to discuss best practices, 
programs, social events, and 
national issues that concern 
graduate students across the 
country.
The conference began 
with an open-to-the-public 
lecture in David Lawrence 
Hall by Jorge Cham, a Stan­
ford graduate who produces 
the popular comic Piled High­
er and Deeper. Piled Higher 
and Deeper, or PhD for short, 
details the often comedic 
yet tragic lives of graduate 
students. Afterward, Cham 
signed books at a barbecue 
hosted in front of the William 
Pitt Union.
P.J. Dillon, a computer 
science Ph.D. student at the 
University of Pittsburgh and 
the current vice president of
communications of the uni­
versity’s Graduate and Pro­
fessional Student Association 
(GPSA) was very happy with 
the turnout for the event. “To 
have the graduate student 
community really come out, 
having them hear him talk 
and laugh, and migrate to the 
food—it kind of carried over 
that good vibe and allowed us 
all to mingle on the grass with 
good weather,” Dillon said.
Saturday was the main 
business day for the confer­
ence. Jason Heustis of Tlifts 
University, who is the NAGPS 
Northeast Regional chair, 
kicked off the conference 
with an overview of the or­
ganization and the regional 
status. After this report and 
breakfast, 12 seminars were 
held throughout the day, 
including talks on lobbying 
and advocacy, community- 
building activities, building 
better websites, health insur­
ance, employment concerns, 
and internal funding man­
agement. Alex Evans, a Ph.D. 
student in geophysics at MIT

bay, completing her bachelor’s 
degree in physics. She then 
moved to the United States 
and received her master’s de­
gree from Kansas State Uni­
versity and, later, her Ph.D. at 
Northwestern University.
Nair first arrived in Pitts­
burgh with the intention of 
pursuing a career as a high 
school physics teacher. After 
spending several years teach­
ing not only physics but also 
other sciences, including 
chemistry and geology, she 
took a small job in the en­
gineering and public policy 
department here at Carn­
egie Mellon. Eventually, she 
joined the Office of the Pro­
vost and accepted her current 
role as the vice provost for
education.
At Carnegie Mellon, the 
provost is the chief academic 
adviser at the university and 
is one of the most powerful 
positions outside the univer­
sity’s president. The provost 
oversees all of the faculty and 
deans in the various schools. 
One of the major offices un­
derneath the provost is that 
of the vice provost for educa­
tion, which has several orga­
nizations of its own working 
beneath it.
“The curriculum itself 
is divided on a department 
level, but I look at common 
needs,” Nair said from her of­
fice in Warner Hall. “[I ask my 
department] what can we do 
to enhance that experience.”
Beneath Nair is a host of dif­
ferent organizations aimed at 
making education an integral 
part of the school and com­
munity. The Leonard Gelfand 
Center, for example, is part of 
the vice provost’s responsibil­
ity and focuses on educational 
outreach. “Carnegie Mellon 
reaches 10,000 students every 
semester,” Nair said. One pro­
gram within the center is C- 
MITES, helping to foster math 
and science skills in gifted 
students from kindergarten 
through 12th grade. Classes 
are taught during the summer 
for these students, and in the 
years to come, students from 
Qatar will also begin attend­
ing these classes.

After much anticipation, 
the 2010 commencement 
speaker was announced last 
Friday. Ian Rawson, the man­
aging director of Haiti’s Hôpi­
tal Albert Schweitzer, will 
give the keynote address.
Rawson has many ties to 
the Pittsburgh area. He is a 
long-time resident of the city 
and has a Ph.D. from the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh in medi­
cal anthropology. In addition 
to earning a bachelor’s de­
gree in political science from 
the American University of 
Beirut, Rawson also attended 
Harvard University’s School 
of Public Health executive 
program in health planning 
and administration.
Additionally, Rawson has 
specific ties to the Carnegie 
Mellon community. Rawson 
has been an adjunct profes­
sor in the Heinz College and 
an advisory board member of 
TechBridgeWorld.
Rawson’s involvement in 
Haiti stems from his parents’ 
interests in the country. Raw­
son’s stepfather and mother, 
William Larimer Mellon, Jr. 
and Gwen Grant Mellon, 
dedicated their lives to im­
proving the quality of life in 
Haiti after being inspired by 
Albert Schweitzer’s exem­
plary efforts in central Africa. 
The Mêlions founded Hôpital 
Albert Schweitzer in 1956. 
Rawson was the board chair 
of the hospital before becom­
ing the managing director.
“Ian Rawson has led the
Hôpital Albert Schweitzer in 
Haiti for many years,” Uni-’ 
versity President Jared Co- 
hon said in a Carnegie Mellon 
press release. “He has worked 
tirelessly and literally non­
stop since the devastation of 
the January earthquake to 
treat the injured and to care 
for thousands of refugees. 
His is a story of leadership 
and selfless dedication that 
will inspire and motivate us 
to respond to the challenges 
facing the world.”
Student reactions to the 
announcement are diverse. 
Senior electrical and comput­
er engineering major Arda 
Orhan simply responded, “I 
don’t care.” Eric Blood, a se­
nior mechanical engineering 
major, had a slightly disap­
pointed reaction. “I was not 
excited because I usually look 
forward to someone that isn’t 
affiliated with campus,” Blood 
said. “People affiliated with 
campus, we can see them at 
lecture series or classes. I’m 
sure he’s qualified, but I was 
looking forward to someone 
from the outside.”
Amy Maples, a senior 
chemical engineering and 
engineering and public 
policy major, was uncertain 
about the university’s choice. 
“I think that a politician or 
comedian is a better choice 
because they give speeches 
for a living. But I don’t know 
anything about him, so I can’t 
say.”
Carnegie Mellon’s 113th 
commencement ceremony is 
set for May 16 at 11 a.m. in 
Gesling Stadium.
Student projects improve campus landscape
PATRICK GAGE KELLEY
Contributing Editor
For the 23rd year, Larry 
Cartwright’s Design and Con­
struction course is working 
to improve the campus land­
scape. While right now the 
class’s work site is still a maze 
of yellow caution tape, wood­
en supports and frames, and 
a mass of moved earth, this is 
only the beginning of the park 
space that it will become.
This year’s project aims 
to memorialize Bill Brown, a 
professor in the biology de­
partment who died in July 
2007. (Read more at www. 
thetartan. org/2007/4/30/ 
news/brown.)
Francesca Fenzi, a sopho­
more in the Bachelor of Hu­
manities and Arts program, 
described the “focus of the 
space to be on collaboration, 
as this is something that Bill 
advocated.” The space, slated 
to be finished by commence­
ment, is a two-tiered patio 
network based off a polygon 
design inspired by Brown’s 
work in biology. The space, 
which is just off the Mall, in
front of Doherty Hall, will 
have benches and a table for 
students to sit, read, discuss, 
work, and most importantly 
collaborate.
Christopher Donlan, a se­
nior in civil engineering and 
the on-site student foreman, 
said, “I think it is important for 
students to leave their mark 
on- CMU’s campus ... and it’s 
an honor to be involved in this 
class and particular project.”
Students in Cartwright’s 
class have been leaving their 
mark on campus since the 
course’s first project in 1988. 
This project was the construc­
tion of a retaining wall and 
driveway for the Robotics 
Institute and was budgeted 
at only $3000. Over the last 
two decades, the projects 
have grown in scope and de­
sign freedom. In recent years 
projects have been more com­
monly allotted budgets in the 
$25,000 to $50,000 range 
and have included the Do­
herty stairs, Scotty’s Corner, 
both the Simon and Newell 
Memorials, and the WQED

Search for dean of Student Affairs continues

Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon is in the 
process of searching for a new 
dean of Student Affairs af­
ter the previous dean, Karen 
Boyd, resigned in December to 
finish her Ph.D. dissertation. 
The school is working with 
executive search firm Isaac­
son, Miller, and the search has 
been narrowed down to four 
candidates. Carnegie Mellon 
is expected to conclude the 
search and appoint its new 
dean of Student Affairs by this 
summer.
In the meantime, Vice 
President for Campus Affairs 
Michael Murphy now serves 
as the interim dean of Student 
Affairs and has kept the school 
community informed about 
the search committee’s and
Isaacson, Miller’s efforts.
“One of the values of the 
process is making sure that we 
get as many perspectives as 
possible in the selection of our 
new dean,” said Murphy. “It is 
essential that the dean has a 
real appreciation for the spe­
cial climate here and the deep 
sense of commitment and col­
laborative spirit that is such a 
part of this place. Certainly, 
someone who will genuinely 
care for and about students, 
and someone who will em­
brace the opportunity to im­
merse themselves in the day- 
to-day life of the campus.”
At Isaacson, Miller, Vice 
President Vivian Brocard and 
Senior Associate Ponneh A. 
Varho detail similar require­
ments in the job description 
on the company’s website: 
“While first-rate administra­
tive skills are essential for 
success in this role, the ideal 
candidate will possess an edu­
cator’s passion and an abiding 
commitment to the individual 
that will contribute to the life­
long welfare and success of 
each student.”
Within the last two years, 
Carnegie Mellon has had four 
individuals in the role of dean 
of Student Affairs. This pro­
gression started in 2008 when 
then dean of Student Affairs 
Jennifer Church resigned af­
ter two years of service.
“When Jennifer Church left 
unexpectedly, we were fortu­
nate that Dick Tucker agreed 
to serve as interim dean of 
Student Affairs for a year,” 
Murphy said.
In July 2009, the university 
named Boyd as the new per­
manent dean. However, Boyd
resigned after only six months 
of service in December that 
year.
“The fact that we are in a 
new search so soon is unfortu­
nate, but everyone has stepped 
up, including students, which 
I appreciate enormously. That 
said, it will be terrific to have 
the new dean on board this 
summer,” Murphy said.
Murphy strongly urged 
students to attend the upcom­
ing town meetings for each of 
the four finalists, at which stu­
dents will be given the oppor­
tunity to meet and ask ques­
tions of the candidates.
“The four finalists are 
great. The committee has 
done a very good job of select­
ing from an impressive and 
competitive national appli-

Statistically 
Speaking
This past week, a new record was set for the Boston 
Marathon. This race is one of the most notable events in 
the running world. The Boston Marathon is the world’s 
oldest marathon and is one of the five World Marathon 
Majors.
Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot of Kenya set the record. 
This 22-year-old is definitely a force to be reckoned with, 
as he has finished fifth or better in the four marathons 
that he has competed in. Here are some facts and figures 
about the new champion and the classic race.

CMU, SIFE receive national recognition
EPA honors green purchases Students to attend nationals
The Environmental Pro­
tection Agency’s (EPA) Green 
Power Partnership, started in 
April 2006, tracks colleges 
and universities with the 
highest green power purchas­
es among collegiate athletic 
conferences.
The Individual Confer­
ence Champion Award rec­
ognizes the school that has 
made the largest purchase of 
green power within a quali­
fying conference. Carnegie 
Mellon University has been 
recognized as the 2009- 
2010 Individual Conference 
Champion, meaning that the 
university uses more green 
power than any other school 
in its division (the University 
Athletic Association).
This year, Carnegie Mel­
lon purchased almost 87 
million kilowatt-hours of 
green power. This purchase 
represents 75 percent of the 
school’s annual electricity us­
age. The EPA estimates that
this purchase is equivalent to 
the carbon dioxide emitted by 
the electricity use in 8000 av­
erage American homes each 
year or taking nearly 12,000 
passenger cars off the road 
annually.
Carnegie Mellon’s con­
tribution represents the ma­
jority of the UAA’s collective 
green power purchases, with 
87 million of more than 92 
million kilowatt-hours of 
green power. Other members 
of the UAA include the Uni­
versity of Rochester, Brandeis 
University, Case Western Re­
serve University, and Emory 
University. Member universi­
ties are located in Georgia, 
Illinois, Missouri, Pennsyl­
vania, Massachusetts, Ohio, 
and New York.
All colleges and 
universities are invited to 
enter the challenge. For more 
information, visit www.epa.

cu_ challenge, h tm.
Carnegie Mellon’s Stu­
dents in Free Enterprise 
(SIFE) will be attending a 
national competition in Min­
neapolis, Minn, from May 11 
to May 13 after winning a re­
gional competition in Phila­
delphia in the spring.
In three corporate topic 
competitions, SIFE also 
placed in the top 20 as na­
tional finalists to receive 
$3000 in prizes.
The awards were provid­
ed by the Robert Half Inter­
national Success Skills Com­
petition, the HSBC Financial 
Literacy Competition, and 
the Sealed Air 'Business Eth­
ics Competition.
To gain this honor, 11 
projects were completed by 
225 Carnegie Mellon SIFE 
students, revolving around 
the six pillars of SIFE, for a 
total of 7880 hours of service 
for the past year.
The six pillars are market 
economics, success skills,
entrepreneurship, financial 
literacy, business ethics, and 
environmental sustainability. 
Some of the 11 projects in­
cluded Project Pulse, Project 
Nicaragua, Project Panama, 
Eco-market, Global Economy, 
and Global Threads.
Coached by Anthony 
Stanton, a teaching profes­
sor of graphic media in the 
Tepper School of Business, 
students from all seven col­
leges at Carnegie Mellon are 
represented, and, according 
to SIFE’s website, the team 
has quickly grown from a 
“rookie” to competing on the 
national level.
On a global scale, over 
1500 universities in 40 coun­
tries actively participate in 
SIFE.

2010 Buhl Lecture: 
Viruses “From Scratch”
Wednesday, April 28 at 
4:30 p.m.
Mellon Institute Auditorium, 
4400 Fifth Ave.
Everyone knows how 
deadly viruses like influenza, 
hepatitis, and AIDS can be. 
Viruses are arguably the most 
prevalent and deadly dis­
ease agents. However, there 
are some people who see 
these as the most beautiful, 
symmetric, and astonishing 
structures in biology. In this 
lecture, WiMiam Gelbart, a 
distinguished professor of 
chemistry and biochemistry 
at UCLA, discusses viruses 
from a physical point of view, 
emphasizing their unique 
simplicity and what they all 
have in common. The most 
minimal ones consist of just 
two different kinds of mol-
Preview
ecules and are simple enough 
that they can be made “from 
scratch” in a test tube. Gelbart 
will also talk about why vi­
ruses were only discovered a 
hundred years ago and what 
allows them to evolve faster 
than any living organism.

Grad students meet in Pittsburgh
CONFERENCE, from A1
Patrick Gage Kelley/Contributing Editor
A visiting student from Penn State embraces Jorge Cham, the author of 
PhD comics, at his book signing.
Dean candidates to visit campus
DEAN, from A1
and the current president of 
NAGPS, was also at the event. 
Evans discussed how regional 
conferences are an excellent 
forum for dealing with gradu­
ate student issues. “A lot of 
the issues we deal with are 
local, and this provides us an 
opportunity to discuss those 
issues and effect change at a 
regional level,” Evans said.
Saturday’s evening activi­
ties took the conference to the 
Harris Grill for a “Pittsburgh- 
style” dinner, followed by Car­
negie Mellon’s Graduate Stu­
dent Assembly (GSA) hosted 
wine-tasting. Jon Kowalski, a 
doctoral student in engineer­
ing and public policy, Carnegie 
Mellon GSA’s vice president of 
external affairs and current 
director of finance for NAGPS, 
said, “This conference is a 
fantastic opportunity for us to 
showcase our premier social 
event of the year to graduate 
student governments all over 
the Northeast.” GSA’s wine- 
tasting is an annual event held
provost for graduate educa­
tion and the director of Un­
dergraduate Research, and 
Fellowship Resources.
Nair has helped organize 
several large projects aimed 
at enriching the undergradu­
ate experience.
One of these programs, . 
Odyssey, is aimed at college 
sophomores and what they 
will do with their scholarship 
to fulfill their citizenship du­
ties. The faculty nominates 
students that they find to be 
intellectual seekers and host a 
three-day workshop right be­
fore spring semester.
Another project is the ac­
claimed University Lecture 
Series, which runs year- 
round. Every Monday and 
Thursday, the faculty invites 
accomplished individuals — 
sometimes faculty, sometimes 
guests — to give a lecture 
about whatever topic they 
are currently working on. A 
recent speaker, Allan Meltzer 
of the Tepper School of Busi­
ness, discussed the Federal 
Reserve and money supply in 
the United States.
Nair has also made revo­
lutions in courses offered at 
Carnegie Mellon, beginning 
with a course titled India To­
day, a weekend course worth 
only three units but requiring 
over 40 hours of class time 
and writing papers. It was 
first created in fall 2008 in col­
laboration with the University 
of Pittsburgh, and the class
at the PPG Aquarium.
On Sunday, the conference 
hosted another installment of 
GPSA’s popular series “Pan­
cakes & Politics” with Allegh­
eny County Council President 
Rich Fitzgerald. Following the 
event was the regional busi­
ness meeting and a closing 
lunch. Carnegie Mellon GSA 
president and Ph.D. student 
in engineering and public 
policy Carolyn Denomme was 
glad that Pittsburgh was able 
to host the conference.
“The regional conference
studies different countries 
every year, including China, 
Brazil, and Russia. “These 
countries are considered the 
most emerging countries to­
day,” Nair said.
Qatar has also been a tar­
get of interest for Nair since 
she arrived. Her course Global 
Issues, Local Solutions, cre­
ated in the spring of 2009, 
addressed the question of 
how to solve global problems 
depending on a country’s cur­
rent economic, political, or 
geographic situation.
Recently, Carnegie Mel­
lon hosted the Global Issues, 
Global Solutions conference, 
which further addressed these 
issues.
Nair’s role as chair of the 
University Education Council 
has also been influential. The 
council’s role to approve uni­
versity-wide courses has been 
an important one; thanks to 
Nair and the council, inter­
disciplinary classes on urban 
farming and materials sci­
ence, energy, and the environ­
ment are now available.
Nair has a great respect 
for interdisciplinary action. 
“Different disciplines are dif­
ferent lenses,” Nair said. “The 
same thing you’re thinking, 
someone else is thinking from 
a different perspective.” To 
help with interdisciplinary 
relations, Nair helped to orga­
nize 1905 = me2: Photons and 
Relativity, a course focused on 
studying how different ideas 
in science developed.
Other faculty members
is a great way to network 
with other graduate student 
leaders and to learn how the 
services that Carnegie Mel­
lon and our GSA provide to 
graduate students compare to 
other institutions and help us 
improve that.”
Kowalski, who served as 
one of the conference co­
chairs was pleased that the 
conference was a success and 
was glad that Carnegie Mel­
lon and the University of Pitts­
burgh found “another great 
opportunity to collaborate.”
have praised Nair’s influence 
across all areas of the univer­
sity. “Indira’s service to the 
Pittsburgh and global commu­
nity, to science education, and 
to Carnegie Mellon’s history 
and its future are immeasur­
able,” said Provost Mark Kam- 
let, according to a Carnegie 
Mellon press release.
“Her passion is conta­
gious,” said history professor 
Nico Slate. Slate, who first met 
Nair in August 2009 through 
other faculty members of the 
School of Humanities and 
Social Sciences, found a mu­
tual interest in India and un­
dergraduate education. Sev­
eral of the students’’in one of 
Slate’s history courses raised 
funds for an environmen­
tal project in India, and the 
money was donated in Nair’s 
name. “It’s been a real honor 
working with her,” Slate con­
cluded.
For the students she is leav­
ing behind, Nair offers these 
words of advice: “Look around 
and find opportunities.” She 
points to the rising number 
of Carnegie Mellon students 
taking a foreign language as 
a positive sign of inter-school 
participation. She also advises 
acting on these opportunities. 
“If you have an idea,” she as­

cant pool,” Murphy said. “The 
candidates are all very excited 
about this opportunity, and 
appreciate what an important 
role this is on our campus.” 
However, after having 
been through this experience 
before, some students are less 
than enthusiastic. “I know it 
may sound shallow, but I think 
at this point, it’s hard to get 
personally attached [to a new 
dean],” sophomore business 
administration major Lillian 
Su said. “I’m really just hop­
ing that he or she will be able
footbridge. Many of these 
sites have been completely ab­
sorbed into the fabric of cam­
pus, and it is likely that many 
campus community members 
are completely unaware that 
they represent the tireless 
work of Cartwright’s class 
over the last 23 years.
Fenzi said the site “in front 
of Scaife is probably my favor­
ite, but also the most hidden,” 
while Donlon spoke highly of 
the Simon Memorial — a seat­
ing area and workspace set 
into the ground outside Baker 
Hall that was built in 2002. “It 
fits so well into the CMU land­
scape and if you did not look 
close you would never notice 
it,” said Donlon. He also said 
“the class of 2008 did a great 
job with the deck added to the 
materials science department 
outside of Wean and Doherty 
on the Gates side.”
Ralph Horgan,' Carnegie 
Mellon’s associate vice pro­
vost for Campus Design and 
Facility Development, says 
that “from a pragmatic per­
spective, Larry and his stu­
dents have created low-cost 
improvements to public spac­
es on campus.” Instead of re-
to boost our ratings,” Su said, 
referring to Carnegie Mellon’s 
Greek and social life ratings, 
which are typically relatively 
low compared to ratings in 
academic categories.
Michael Arntzenius, a ju­
nior computer science major, 
attended the town meeting 
last Tuesday. He remarked, 
“I think what the university 
is just looking for right now 
is someone who is going to 
stay.... [The candidate] had 
an impressive resume, but can 
they really promise that they 
will stay at this school in par­
ticular?”
quiring millions of dollars to 
be donated for construction, 
departments can entrust Cart­
wright and his students to im­
prove a small part of campus, 
and give it a specific purpose 
like the Mellon College of Sci­
ence has with their memorial 
to Brown.
Horgan said that when 
members of his team at Cam­
pus Design and Facility Devel­
opment give tours of campus 
and they come across many of 
Cartwright’s projects, people 
inevitably question the deci­
sion to let students design and 
construct permanent projects. 
Horgan’s response: “We en­
courage it, because it’s Larry 
and his fourth year class. It’s 
part of the DNA here; we still 
make things.”
For now, personal infor­
mation about any of the four 
candidates has not yet been 
released to the public.
“We are not announcing 
the names, just to maintain 
some level of confidentiality 
for the candidates,” explained 
Murphy. “But of course any­
one who participates in the 
open process will meet them 
and receive a copy of their ré­
sumés.”
The remaining three town 
hall meetings are scheduled 
for April 26, April 28, and 
April 29. These will take place 
in Danforth Lounge.
The class and its mission, 
which Horgan sees as part of 
the very essence of Carnegie 
Mellon, is firmly supported by 
the students. Donlan agreed, 
“this class is different from 
any other class I have ever 
taken at CMU and the hands 
on experience and learning 
is unbelievable,” he said. “It 
is a time commitment, but I 
enjoy spending time getting 
dirty and using some elbow 
grease.”
Fenzi also knows the 
course is unique, and while 
she wishes that more students 
could have these sorts of op­
portunities, she was quick to 
remind me that students can 
still have this opportunity as 
“Larry’s teaching the class 
next year so it’s not too late!”

Minput makes movement a new way to control small electronics
üMimiL
BRIAN LEE
SciTech Editor
The world of electronics 
is rapidly changing. Today, 
touchpads like those seen in 
the iPad are popular, replac­
ing conventional keyboards 
with a screen. As handheld 
devices also become smaller 
and more compact than ever, 
innovative technology must 
be developed to navigate 
through different screens.
Minput, a device that 
hopes to solve the problem of 
space and visibility in small 
devices and screens, is being 
developed by Chris Harrison 
and Scott Hudson, who are 
both part of Carnegie Mel­
lon’s Human-Computer Inter­
action Institute. Harrison has 
already been featured in The 
Tartan for his work with Skin- 
put, which turns the arm into 
a touchpad.
When sliding Minput over 
a surface, sensors on the bot­
tom can register movement 
to control various software 
on the device. In this respect, 
Minput is a mouse with the 
computer screen attached, 
and it can be manipulated 
without having the user’s fin­
gers block the screen.
Harrison has uploaded a 
video online describing vari­
ous capabilities^ of Minput, 
which has already^ been de­
veloped as a proof-of-concept 
device. Minput is named be­
cause it is an input technique 
for miniature input devices. 
These devices are too small 
to have buttons or for touch­
screen capability to be practi­
cal.
Minput allows mouse con­
trol and optical tracking to 
be applied to small mobile 
devices. Currently, the tech­
nology is being developed 
using a 1.5-inch LCD screen, 
according to a www.cnet. 
com article. The LCD screen 
was taken from a wristwatch 
that originally allowed users 
to watch television or mov­
ies. On the side opposite the 
screen, two optical sensors 
from a SlimG4 mouse were 
attached. The entire assembly 
was connected to a computer, 
which processes data from the 
optical sensors.
According to a demon­
stration in Harrison’s video, 
Minput could be operated 
anywhere a user could possi­
bly use the device, including 
on a table, on the leg of one’s 
pants, and on a user’s palm. 
Because there are two sen­
sors on the device, a variety 
of motion can be detected, 
including twisting the de­
vice on a table. According to 
www.chrisharrison.com, the 
optical devices use negligible 
tracking power. According to 
the video, Minput supports 
three “input modalities,” or 
ways the user can manipu­
late the device. Gestural input 
modality involves motions 
like flicks and twists and was 
demonstrated using photo­
browsing software. Flicking 
the device in a certain direc­
tion changes the image, while 
twisting changes the number 
of images on the screen, like 
a zooming function. These 
inputs can be changed to per­
form many functions on dif­
ferent programs. The variety 
of motions allows programs 
on the devices to change cer­
tain settings without having 
to navigate complex menus. 
For example, turning the de­
vice like a knob can be used to 
adjust volume of music, while

Two years ago, an organ 
transplant in Spain caught the 
attention of the medical com­
munity across the world. As 
reported in a story on www. 
dailymail.co.uk, Claudia Cas­
tillo of Spain received a wind­
pipe generated from her own 
stem cells.
Organ transplantation has 
been performed for years. 
However, in most conven­
tional organ transplants, the 
patient’s immune system is 
likely to attack the transplant­
ed organ, as it is foreign to 
the body. Therefore, patients 
undergoing organ transplants 
are given drugs that suppress 
their immune system.
However, this suppression 
of the immune system makes 
the patient highly susceptible 
to a variety of infections. Ac­
cording to an article on eMed- 
icine, 27 percent of patients 
who die after an organ trans­
plant are killed by opportunis­
tic infections or complications 
related to the infections. What 
made Castillo’s transplant re­
markable was that an organ 
generated from her own cells 
was used. The body would not 
reject such an organ, and im­
munosuppression would not 
be needed in this case.
Castillo’s windpipe was 
generated using stem cells 
obtained from her bone mar­
row. Bone marrow stem cells 
have the potential to develop 
into a variety of different cells
— in this case, they were used 
to develop cartilage cells. 
Castillo’s bone marrow stem
cells were grown in a lab to 
produce nearly 6 million car­
tilage cells.
The process of directing 
the stem cells to grow into a 
particular cell type is not that 
difficult. According to an ar­
ticle in the journal Materials 
Today, simply changing the 
media in which the cells are 
grown can cause them to form 
the desired cell type.
Once the cartilage cells 
were obtained, they needed 
to be grown on an appropri­
ate support or scaffold to gen­
erate the entire organ. In Cas­
tillo’s case, a donor windpipe
was used as the scaffold. The 
original windpipe was treated 
with a variety of chemicals in 
order to remove all of the orig­
inal cells on the windpipe.
What remained was a 
scaffold made up of a fibrous 
protein, collagen. Finally, the 
cartilage cells were allowed to 
grow on the scaffold in a spe­
cial bioreactor. The resulting 
windpipe was transplanted 
into Castillo’s body. Castillo, 
whose original windpipe had 
become blocked and was 
causing her severe breathing

Cultures of human stem cells can be used in many ways. Because they 
have not differentiated yet, they have the ability to become any kind of 
cell in the human body.
HOW THINGS WORKAtomic force microscopy: Technique allows scientists to view atoms
KUSH MANGAL
Staffwriter
Atomic force microscopy 
(AFM), a popular tool for im­
aging, measuring, and ma­
nipulating matter at the nano­
scale, was invented in 1986 
and was commercialized in 
1989. This type of microscopy 
gathers information by feeling 
the surface with mechanical 
probes. AFM is a type of scan­
ning probe microscopy (SPM) 
in which the image of a surface 
is obtained by moving a probe 
over a sample and recording 
the interactions between the 
probe and the surface of the 
sample.
AFM is used for a variety 
of biological applications, in­
cluding imaging molecules, 
cells, tissues, and biomateri­
als. At Carnegie Mellon, AFM 
is being used to study peptides 
and lipoproteins. AFM, popu­
larly used in nanotechnology 
research, has been used to im­
age the surface of the ivy plant 
to understand how it climbs 
structures, as stated in an ar­
ticle on www.photonics.com.
According to www. veeco.
com, AFM is on the cutting 
edge of science since it pro­
vides true three-dimensional 
surface images. AFM is used to 
image and manipulate atoms 
and structures on many differ­
ent surfaces. Samples viewed 
by AFM do not need any spe­
cial treatments. The technol­
ogy provides higher resolution 
images than other methods 
such as the scanning electron 
microscope. It is also favorable 
since it has the ability to oper­
ate in liquids and work with 
sample sizes ranging from a 
few nanometers up to several 
micrometers.
An AFM consists of several 
important components: a scan­
ner (which is mounted above 
the tip or below the sample), 
a detector, and feedback con­
trols. A cantilever moves over 
the surface of a sample in a 
scan. The cantilever is usually 
composed of silicon or silicon 
nitride, and has a sharp tip on 
one side that interacts with 
surface of a sample. The type 
of tip used depends on the 
sample it will interact with. 
The scanner is made from a 
tube of piezoelectric elements,
which are materials that 
change shape when a certain 
amount of voltage is applied to 
them. According to the optical 
level method for the detector, 
a laser beam is shot at the tip 
of the cantilever and is reflect­
ed onto a position-sensitive 
photo-detector.
According to the book 
Atomic Force MicroscopyBio­
medical Methods and Appli­
cations, AFM can operate in 
several modes: force-distance, 
contact, and tapping mode. In 
the force-distance mode, the 
tip will start above the surface 
and is brought down. When 
the tip is close to the surface, 
it sticks to it and then retracts 
back to the starting point.
In the contact mode, the tip 
contacts the surface, and the 
tip will deflect up and down 
based on the sample’s topogra­
phy. The force feedback from 
the tip ensures that there is 
contact with the surface. Con­
tact mode provides informa­
tion about physical properties 
such as elasticity, adhesion, 
hardness, and friction.
In tapping mode, the canti­
lever is oscillated and brought
into contact with the surface. 
The contact with the sample is 
intermittent over a very short 
time. The changing amplitude 
of the oscillation provides 
information about the sur­
face. Tapping mode is a better 
choice with soft samples since 
it is less damaging, while con­
tact mode is most useful for 
hard surfaces.
The tip used in AFM is one 
of the important factors in­
fluencing the resolution ob­
tained. The sharper the tip 
used, the greater the resolu­
tion. The tip can be affected by 
different parameters to alter 
the image. These are compres­
sion, interaction forces, and ir­
regular curvatures. Compres­
sion affects studies with DNA, 
irregular curvatures cause 
broadening in the image, and 
interaction forces cause an in­
crease in image contrast.
AFM is a great tool for visu­
alization on the atomic scale. 
The images it provides of both 
conductive and nonconduc- 
tive materials are valuable to 
researchers. AFM allows for a 
different way to visualize mol­
ecules in three dimensions.

Facebook simplifies sharing Water consumption assessed * Obama eyes MarsIcelandic volcano subsides
At Facebook’s annual conference last week, 
Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s co-founder 
and CEO, announced the launch of “Open 
Graph” — an interactive social tool that will 
collect information about a person’s Facebook 
activities, such as the websites they visit and 
their favorite news stories or music, and share 
it with their Facebook friends.
According to Zuckerberg, this new social 
paradigm is “the most transformative thing” 
Facebook has created for the web.
Popular Facebook features such as “Like” 
buttons will now appear not just on Facebook. 
com, but also on several other sites, including 
blogs. With over 400 million members, Face­
book hopes to enable its members to conve­
niently share their likes and dislikes without 
giving away any new information.

To measure the impact of industrial decisions 
on water use, researchers at Carnegie Mellon 
studied water data from the United States Geo­
logical Survey conducted in 2000 and used an 
economic model to calculate direct and indirect 
water usage in over 400 industries.
Chris Hendrickson, a professor of civil and 
environmental engineering; Michael Black- 
hurst, a graduate student; and Jordi Sels i Vid­
al, a visiting researcher, concluded that most 
water is directly consumed by the power gen­
eration and agriculture industries.
They also found that most individual sectors 
use water indirectly, such as the refining pro­
cess of cane sugar, which uses over 95 percent 
of its water indirectly to grow the cane, gener­
ate electricity for the mills, and ensure other 
industrial processes run smoothly.

By 2030, American astronauts should be 
able to set foot on Mars and return home safely, 
said Barack Obama during a speech at the Ken­
nedy Space Center in Florida.
As he laid out his new policy for the U.S. 
space agency, Obama announced that he plans 
to set “challenging goals” for NASA and provide 
the organization with the funding to deliver 
them. He will allocate an extra $6 billion to 
NASA over the next five years for the realization 
of this vision.
In addition, Obama asked for 
a “refocused” NASA that goes 
beyond Constellation — the 
current program to replace 
the space shuttle and the 
termination of which he an­
nounced in February.

Tucked under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier in 
Iceland, the volcanic eruption that caused hav­
oc among air travelers last week seems to have 
subsided, according to volcanologists.
While the volcano is still releasing small 
amounts of ash, it is doing so less explosively, 
they reported. As suggested by the scientists, a 
reduced flow of magma into the volcano cham­
ber and the melting of most of the glacier clos­
est to the volcano may be the main reasons.
Despite the positive signs, volcanologist 
Chris Waythomas of the U.S. Geological Survey 
warned that the situation may not be so stable, 
comparing it to volcanoes in Alaska. “Eruptions 
wax and wane, and sustained ash emissions 
don’t go on indefinitely,” he said. “You get ex­
plosive activity, it quiets down for a week or so, 
then it re-erupts again.”

Stem cell organ transplants may eliminate rejection complications
ORGAN, from A4
problems, could breathe nor­
mally and resume a normal 
lifestyle after the transplant.
Although the procedure 
was successful and benefited 
Castillo, it was extremely ex­
pensive. Specifically, the use 
of the bioreactor to regener­
ate the entire organ increased 
the costs of the procedure by 
a large amount. However, as 
recently as last month, scien­
tists have been able to repli­
cate this procedure without 
the need of the expensive bio­
reactor.
Last month, doctors at the 
Great Ormond Street Hos­
pital in London conducted a 
similar windpipe transplant 
in a 10-year-old boy. Accord­
ing to the report in the Brit­
ish publication The Times, the 
boy received a transplanted 
windpipe that was regener­
ated using his own stem cells. 
However, unlike Castillo’s 
transplant, the windpipe was 
not generated in a specialized
bioreactor, but was regener­
ated within the boy’s body.
In this case, a donor wind­
pipe was stripped of its origi­
nal cells and was treated with 
the boy’s bone marrow stem 
cells. However, before the 
stem cells could completely 
grow on the scaffold, the 
windpipe was transplanted 
into the boy, making the boy’s 
body the “bioreactor” where 
the remaining growth could 
take place.
A professor at the Universi­
ty College London was quoted 
in The Times article as saying 
.that this procedure would 
now cost “tens of thousands of 
pounds rather than hundreds 
of thousands,” because the ar­
tificial bioreactor is no longer 
needed.
Although the procedure 
conducted on the British boy 
could help a number of pa­
tients worldwide in need of 
organ transplants, scientists 
worry that such a procedure 
could be extremely unpredict­
able. Laboratory generation
of organs can be controlled 
to a much higher degree than 
organ generation within the 
human body. Hence, regen­
eration of organs within the 
body could lead to unexpect­
ed complications.

sliding the device left and

A second input modality 
makes Minput a virtual win­
dow — by sliding the device 
around, a high-resolution 
photograph can be exam­
ined. The picture seems to 
stay in the same place while 
the device moves, so it is as if 
the user is seeing the picture 
through a window. This can 
also be applied when viewing 
text documents or web pages. 
While not implemented yet, 
links may be clicked by tap­
ping the device. The final in­
put modality is cursor control, 
meaning Minput can act like 
a mouse, allowing the user
to play a simple game. In the 
future, researchers hope this 
type of input modality will be 
applied to viewing web pages 
and other tasks that normally 
require a mouse on conven­
tional screens.
While only in the develop­
ment phase, Minput has the 
potential to change handheld 
devices. With a simple, intui­
tive design, it addresses issues 
concerning space and func­
tionality of small devices.

THISTLES and THORNS
At the close of every year, The Tartan 
reassesses the year’s events. We present 
here a list of the people and happen­
ings that are worthy of recognition. 
Thistles go to people and events that 
had a positive effect on the campus 
community and the world at large; 
thorns go to those that have negatively 
impacted the community.
bjjfa A thistle to Google for standing 
up for human rights and mak­
ing the decision to reject the censor­
ship of the Chinese government. We 
are glad the company is not putting 
profit ahead of its principles and the 
freedom of people across the globe.
|^j7 A thorn to the G-20 protest- 
ers ancj the ensuing police re­
sponse. Smashing the windows of 
Pamela’s and other local businesses 
doesn’t support any cause, and using 
rubber bullets, tear gas, and military- 
grade sonic weapons on students is 
excessive.
ijP’jr A thistle to the university for 
buying several pieces of land 
in Oakland over the last few years. 
Despite hard economic times, we are 
pleased to see that the university is 
still moving forward and develop­
ing plans for expanding to meet the 
needs of our growing campus com­
munity.
t
A thorn to the Steelers and 
Ben Roethlisberger. In 2009, 
the Pittsburgh Steelers were nation­
al champions. This year, the team 
didn’t even make the playoffs. Even 
more disappointing than the team’s 
season, however, are the actions of 
quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Ro­
ethlisberger has been in the news, 
not for football, but for allegations of 
sexual assault. We expect more from 
Big Ben.
A thistle to the campus com- 
munity for hosting many events 
this semester. Each weekend is jam- 
packed with lectures, shows, movies, 
and more. We are excited to see stu­
dent activities thriving and hope that 
this trend continues while increasing 
student involvement on campus.
A thorn to the sororities that 
used spray chalk during re­
cruitment. This took a Carnegie 
Mellon tradition and abused it, mak­
ing our campus sidewalks look like 
they had been defaced and not like 
they were advertising exciting stu­
dent events. FMS employees should 
not have had to pressure wash 
the sidewalks prior to Bill Gates’ vis­
it, or at all.
A thistle to the administration 
for taking Dean Karen Boyd’s 
resignation in stride and again work­
ing to find a qualified, committed,
and beloved dean of Student Affairs 
while keeping the campus popula­
tion informed.
dfe? A thorn to the position of dean 
-H&* of Student Affairs for not stay­
ing filled for longer than a year for the 
past three years. This is an important 
part of our campus community that 
should be filled by a candidate who 
will be with the university for many 
years.
A thistle to the lOOOplus com-
munity service initiative for 
obtaining 1000 volunteers for the 
first time in its three-year history. 
lOOOplus has increased the presence 
of community service on campus 
through the organization of a com­
plicated and successful event. We 
hope they will continue to grow for 
years to come.
A thorn to the city of Pittsburgh 
¦dfc- for being woefully unprepared 
to deal with the blizzard this winter. 
Missing three days of class was a nice 
and certainly unexpected break, but 
it is not justified given the amount of 
snow. We believe the city should take 
up Carnegie Mellon’s offer to help 
them better prepare for any future 
snowfall.
j^r A thistle to CulinArt and Din-
ing Services for listening to stu­
dents’ concerns about campus din­
ing. We have seen a greater variety 
of eating options, and we appreciate 
the well-informed decision to keep 
the Downtown Deli in the UC Mar­
ketplace open until 8 p.m. and the 
opening of Tazza D’Oro in the Gates 
Center. We believe CulinArt had a 
great first year and remain excited to 
see what else they will do.
A thorn to the School of Com- 
¦M* puter Science for locking most 
of the Gates Hillman Complex to 
undergraduates after 6 p.m. and on 
weekends. This makes it harder for 
students to get to office hours, and 
it discourages collaboration among 
students and faculty.
bffitr A thistle to Vice Provost for
Education Indira Nair for her 
dedication and commitment over 
her 32 years at Carnegie Mellon. 
We wish her the best in her retire­
ment; she will be truly missed by the 
campus community. For more on Dr. 
Nair’s tenure at the university, see 
page Al.
A thorn to the Tepper School of
Business and others behind the 
Ginger’s — ahem, The Exchange’s
— redesign. We miss having enough 
space to sit and do not see the utility 
in the extra counter. We are happy, 
however, to see that the service and 
food have remained the same.
ijffjr A thistle to Carnegie Mellon 
Health Services for responding 
to the swine flu outbreak by helping 
students protect themselves. While 
the e-mails may have seemed exces­
sive at times, keeping campus safe is 
clearly a priority. Regardless, the ad­
dition of hand sanitizer dispensers 
near every building exit is both use­
ful and sensible.
A thorn to Pittsburgh Mayor 
Luke Ravenstahl for his mis­
guided tuition tax. Carnegie Mellon 
and other university students pay 
enough to come here without an 
added bill to cover Pittsburgh’s ram­
pant budgetary failures.
ijSfar A thistle to the campus and 
Pittsburgh university communi­
ties for working together on common 
projects. From protesting the tuition 
tax to supporting relief efforts in Hai­
ti, Carnegie Mellon and our nearby 
schools made an impact in our local 
and global community.
A thorn to Student Senate for 
not convincing the student 
body that student government is 
important enough to be involved in. 
Many Senate seats went uncontested 
or vacant this year, and the campus 
response has seemingly been dismis­
sive that these vacancies matter at 
all.
05/ A thistle to the men’s soccer 
team for making it to NCAA 
Sweet 16 for the first time in its his­
tory. We hope the campus commu­
nity shows more recognition of our 
school’s athletic successes.
rf&rr A thorn to the Buggy safety pol- 
icy, which has a zero-tolerance 
approach but ambiguous guidelines. 
We agree that safety should not be 
compromised, but using unspecific 
terms like “near” places both teams 
and officials in difficult positions.
jjpljr A thistle" to Gina Casalegno 
for stepping up to run the 
Career and Professional Develop­
ment Center and act as assistant 
dean of Student Affairs. We already 
miss her tremendously as a strong 
and capable leader of the Student 
Activities Office, and we thank 
her for serving as our adviser for sev­
eral years.
A thorn to those responsible 
-nfc- for spray painting chickens and 
setting them loose around campus. 
These acts of animal cruelty show a 
blatant lack of responsibility and em­
barrass the entire Carnegie Mellon 
community.
Looking forward to the 2010-11 year, 
we hope to see growth in Student Af­
fairs and less spray vandalism.
As college students, we are always 
being warned to be careful of what 
we put online for everyone to see be­
cause it could come back to hurt us 
later. Most of us don’t consider our 
e-mail accounts to be something ev­
eryone can see, and so we often put 
things into e-mails that we wouldn’t 
want everyone to know.
The Department of Justice 
(DOJ), however, seems to disagree. 
It considers e-mail accounts “public”
— that is, it does not believe that po­
lice and government agents should 
need warrants or probable cause to 
search through them.
Recently, the DOJ took Yahoo! 
to court over this issue, fighting to 
be allowed to read e-mail stored on 
Yahoo! mail servers. Yahoo! fought 
back to protect its users’ rights, and 
other companies, including Google, 
joined the fight against this invasion 
of privacy.
Significantly, the DOJ dropped 
the suit last week, giving up (for 
now) on the right to read e-mails.
This open disregard for privacy 
is troubling, but not wholly unex­
pected. After 9/11, we allowed the 
government to go much further in 
the invasion of privacy than we did 
beforey and this has opened the door 
for more unreasonable requests. 
The difference now is that someone 
is fighting back.
The government should not be 
allowed access to personal e-mail 
accounts without a warrant, regard­
less of which server they are stored 
on or how old they are. Currently, 
there are different rules for e-mails 
over 181 days old, and warrants are 
not required for these older mes­
sages.
This means that any messages 
that are over six months old are fair 
game, and the government could 
presumably access them without 
a warrant. Users who store their e- 
mails perpetually should perhaps 
rethink their storage plan, as the 
government can go look at these 
messages, no matter how private or 
personal, and potentially use them 
against their owners.
This rule should be changed. If it 
can’t be, then users should be made 
clearly aware of it — and not in one 
of those long, fine-print, rarely read 
privacy policy agreements.
'E-mails, regardless of how old 
they are, should be treated like any 
other form of communication or 
property. The government must ob­
tain a warrant for mail sent through 
the postal service, so why not for e- 
mail as well?
No e-mails should be available 
to any government representative 
without a warrant, whether they’ve 
been opened, or what the govern­
ment thinks it can learn. If there’s 
a valid reason to suspect that some­
thing suspicious will be contained in 
an e-mail, then there should be no 
trouble obtaining a warrant.
In 2007, when the government 
gained access to a man’s e-mail 
without a warrant in order to find 
evidence for a fraud case — the man 
was accused of “selling” male en­
hancement products through e-mail
— the courts ruled that this was 
unconstitutional and that the gov­
ernment needed a warrant for the 
evidence to be admissible.
Now, three years later, the same 
argument is again being waged on 
a larger scale, but this time the gov­
ernment didn’t wait for the court to 
rule against them before backing 
down.
Yahoo!, Google, and the other 
companies in opposition to the gov­
ernment on this matter should be 
commended for their willingness to 
protect their users’ rights and pri­
vacy.
In order to protect the rights of 
consumers, the Digital Due Process 
Coalition was formed. Organiza­
tions and corporations have banded 
together to lobby for the protection 
of digital communications privacy 
rights. This group is trying to require 
the government to obtain a warrant 
in order to use e-mails in court and 
to use GPS technology in cell phones 
to locate criminals or suspected 
criminals.
This group and others like it are 
extremely important today, when 
most people use the Internet and 
cell phones without even thinking, 
expecting that their conversations 
and dealings are private and vis­
ible only to the intended recipient. 
In,fact, in many e-mail messages, a 
disclaimer at the bottom states that 
only the intended recipient should 
read the contents of the message.
Companies and those accused of 
crimes are finally beginning to chal­
lenge what has been an almost un­
restricted power of the government 
for nearly a decade.
While allowances were made 
shortly following the 9/11 attacks, it 
is beyond time to return to the Con­
stitution.
Amanda Cole (aco\e@) is a senior 
in English and history. She is glad 
that the government won't be able 
to read her e-mails and welcomes 
all responses.

America’s nuclear policy needs new vision
-ADPiile
AKSHAY DAVE
Over the years, the nuclear dis­
armament process has gained great 
momentum, with the two Cold War 
powers — the United States and 
Russia — showing strong resolve to 
reduce their vast nuclear stockpiles. 
On April 14, world leaders concluded 
a two-day summit on international 
nuclear security. While President 
Obama was quick to deem it a step 
forward, his argument is anything 
but convincing.
Though Russia and the United 
States renewed their vows at the sum­
mit, Obama has had great difficulty 
in bringing nations such as China, In­
dia, and Pakistan to the negotiating 
table. Israeli Prime Minister Benja­
min Netanyahu was afraid that there 
would be demands for Israel to sign 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
so he just stayed home. Iran was not 
invited and held its own Internation­
al Conference on Disarmament and 
Non-Proliferation in protest.
While it is important that Russia, 
the country with the world’s largest 
stockpile, is continuing the disarma­
ment process, without support from 
every nation it will be impossible to 
achieve the lofty goal of complete 
disarmament. And the problem that 
we face today is not of legality but of 
mixed messages and poor diplomacy. 
The Iran issue serves as a great ex­
ample of the hypocrisy of America’s 
approach to the problem.
Israel has maintained a (not-so-) 
secret nuclear program for about 30 
years now and, while there have been 
whimpers of complaint, America has 
generally accepted it and moved on. 
Never do we hear of American poli­
ticians berating Israel for flouting 
international regulations or breaking 
IAEA rules.
Another country with nuclear am­
bitions is India. After years of mistrust 
and burdensome sanctions, George
There is no music heard 
in Mogadishu after ban
PATRICK GAGE KELLEY
On April 13, the music stopped. 
It disappeared. The airwaves were 
emptied of rhythm and beat, of sing­
ing and instrumentation. Somalian 
radios now only amplify the sounds 
of the natural environment: people 
speaking, animals crooning, gun­
fire, and explosions.
This change in programming was 
due not to a governmental edict but 
on the orders of an insurgent group, 
the Hizbul Islam. They declared that 
broadcasting music was against the 
principles of Islam (for a very strict 
definition), and the stations com­
plied.
Of the 16 stations available in 
Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital city, 
14 have removed all music — not 
just the playing of songs, traditional 
or contemporary, but also program 
introductions, jingles during the 
commercials, and anything else 
that might be considered music. 
Two have resisted thus far: Radio 
Mogadishu, which is government- 
controlled — just about the only 
thing left in Somalia where the gov­
ernment has control — and Radio 
Bar-Kulan, based in Nairobi.
In a quasi-rebellion, the mu­
sic has been replaced with “natu­
ral” sounds, but this is likely just a 
temporary game, as a harsher de­
cree will be next. First, remove all 
sounds that aren’t humans talking. 
Next, broadcast only the bulletins of 
our order, approved by the militant 
leaders (i.e. you can broadcast if you 
have more guns). Finally, just shut 
down the entire radio network.
This is Somalia.
Since 1991, the country has hard­
ly been a country at all. With a civil 
war that became another conflict, 
followed by yet more war and more 
conflict, any sort of normalcy, unity, 
or government has been impossible
to maintain. So the people are left in 
a decades-long battle since the con­
flict first began, one that no longer 
has a soundtrack. The Guardian, in 
its piece on the radio silencing, sug­
gests, “The music ban is likely to 
be highly unpopular...” as if there 
is some chance that one more lost 
freedom is going to cause the So­
mali people to run into the street 
singing and dancing, which would, 
of course, be against the law.
Oh, and if you happen to be­
lieve music on the radio should be 
banned, you might also agree with 
a second Somali militant group’s 
decision to stop using bells to end 
classes. Bells: also too musical. Bells 
sound like bells in Christian church­
es. (Apparently Christians have a 
monopoly on the sound of bells.) 
Regarding bells: “Any school heard 
using bell sounds after now will be 
brought to Islamic justice.” Some 2 
million people live in Mogadishu, 
and today they continue to have 
their rights further restricted, with 
no real end in sight.
As the groups exert further pres­
sure on the remaining media that 
exists, journalism becomes even 
more difficult. Just last year nine 
journalists were killed in Somalia, 
more than any other African nation..
But maybe this decade will be 
better. With some hope, some luck, 
or an awful lot of concerted effort, 
maybe a government that can actu­
ally hold power will unite Somalia, 
help journalists freely report on 
their country, allow schools to sig­
nal the ends of their classes with a 
noise of their choosing, and allow 
radio stations to broadcast a bit of 
entertainment into Somali homes 
in the evening. Maybe that music 
won’t have to be turned up to drown 
out the explosions occurring across 
the city.
Or maybe Somalia will grow even 
more cut off from the rest of the 
world, the entire country silenced.

troversy, a civilian nuclear deal was 
finally signed in 2008, despite India’s 
being a non-signatory to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. Interna­
tional rules were bent to make way 
for common sense.
And now it looks like Obama is 
getting drawn into another pointless 
legal battle, using sanctions when 
they make no logical sense. Just be­
cause Iran, is a theocratic and unsta­
ble country does not mean they do 
not have the right to possess nuclear 
weapons. No amount of legal maneu­
vering and international condemna­
tion will change Iran’s mind. Nuclear 
development has become a matter 
of national pride, and all the taunt­
ing is only serving to strengthen their 
resolve, allowing leaders like Mah- 
moud Ahmadinejad to keep their 
public emotionally charged.
While the summit was a good way 
for Obama to display his commitment 
to world peace, until the focus of nu­
clear disarmament policy is shifted 
from enforcing legal requirements 
to understanding international mo­
tivations, we will remain years away 
from a nuclear-arms-free world.

End of LOST benefits show’s viewers, legacy
HEATHER TOMKO
Son of a bitch — the six-season 
television phenomena LOST is quick­
ly coming to a close.
The series was able to keep us 
entertained for six seasons, build­
ing off a simple plot that seemingly 
wouldn’t last beyond the very first 
season — a plane crashed on a de­
serted island, and the survivors 
needed to find a way to save them­
selves and get home. Except then we 
found out that the Island (and yes, 
as all LOST fans will understand, it 
really does deserve the capital “I”) 
wasn’t deserted, that “the Others” 
lived there and had been spying on 
them from the very beginning. And 
then we met Desmond, the dedicat­
ed button-pusher, via Locke’s crazy 
mission to open the Hatch, and with 
him the Dharma Initiative was intro­
duced as well.
Just when we thought that we had 
things figured out, and the survivors 
were clearly going to be stuck on the 
Island forever, six of them were able 
to make it off — only to return not 
even a full season later. And while 
the Oceanic Six were enjoying (or 
lamenting, if you’re Jack) being off 
the Island, the remaining survivors 
stuck there were time traveling. Yes, 
that is correct, they time traveled 
back to the 1970s, to live in Dhar- 
maville. And now, as the final season 
draws to an end, we’re watching two 
alternate universes unraveling at the 
same time, trying to figure out which 
one the characters will end up in.
It’s not only the crazy plot twists 
that have kept viewers’ attention, 
either. The characters’ personalities 
and the relationships between them 
are so compelling that it’s hard not 
to find yourself drawn in and taking 
sides. (Jack and Kate are so clearly 
meant to be together.) I’m sure that 
Sun and Jin’s long-awaited reunion
brought tears to almost everyone’s 
eyes, and I know that I’m not the only 
one who is upset over Sayid’s current 
zombie-like state.
So, as much as I’m going to miss 
LOST once this season ends, I want 
to commend the creators, directors, 
and producers of the show for end­
ing now, before it has a chance to go 
bad. With the number of questions 
that have been introduced through­
out the show’s run (and are still un­
answered), it would certainly be pos­
sible for the show to run indefinitely. 
But instead, the LOST team is choos­
ing to end it when people are still in­
terested, when the plot is still fresh 
and viewers still want to know what 
will happen next and how it will end. 
Even for those who have fallen out 
of watching the show over the years, 
many plan to tune back in for the last 
episode, just to see how things end.
Movies and television today are 
so centered on drawing things out 
long after they should have ended
— I’m pretty sure we’re on season
20 of The Hills, and I’m almost posi­
tive every other movie trailer I see 
is either a sequel or a remake of an 
old movie. The LOST creators could 
certainly choose to continue capi­
talizing off their success, if they so 
desired, and keep filming more sea­
sons. But they’re not; they’re choos­
ing the viewers, and their opinion of 
the show, over the chance to make 
more profit. They want to end the 
show on a high note, instead of end­
ing after a few more seasons of earn­
ings accompanied by tired plotlines 
and relationships.
So, while I will be sad once I am 
no longer able to see Sayid for an 
hour each Tuesday night, or watch 
Jack and Kate give each other slight­
ly awkward, pointed, love-filled 
stares, I do believe the choice to end 
the show now is the right one.
Namaste.

uating senior and is on Team Sayid,

Graduates get outside 
of the lab
CAROLYN DENOMME
This past weekend was the cul­
mination of a busy semester for 
the Graduate Student Assembly 
(GSA). Saturday night was our 
annual wine-tasting event, where 
1000 graduate students and guests 
traded lab coats for cocktail dress­
es and suits and took over the Pitts­
burgh Aquarium to sample Old and 
New World wines.
Sprinkled among the Carnegie 
Mellon grad students, sharks, and 
sea otters were graduate leaders 
from other northeastern schools 
who were in Pittsburgh for the re­
gional conference of the National 
Association of Graduate-Profes- 
sional Students (NAGPS), co­
hosted by us and the University of 
Pittsburgh. It was a weekend that 
focused on graduate student life, 
and it was a great chance for us to 
share how we use our social events 
to promote interaction among 
graduate students and help them 
take a break from their long hours 
of research and studying.
Back in February, we took ad­
vantage of the Legislative Action 
Days event in Washington, D.C. 
organized by NAGPS. Three gradu­
ate students met with 13 congress­
men over two days and discussed 
the importance of open access to 
research. GSA is now discussing 
the implications of passing a reso­
lution about open access and is 
talking with other schools about 
the Right to Research Coalition.
Around Pittsburgh, we, along 
with other members of the Pitts­
burgh Council for Higher Educa­
tion, have formed the Pittsburgh 
Student Governments’ Council to 
keep the momentum of student 
involvement that grew out of the 
tuition tax debate. We’re also 
branching out by hosting some of 
our monthly happy hours in new 
neighborhoods — this semester we 
have held events in the South Side 
and Greenfield.
Around campus we have been 
busy, too. Graduate students were 
celebrated during Graduate Stu­
dent Appreciation Week in early 
April with free breakfast, free mas­
sages, a research exhibition, and 
departmental events. Graduate 
students have been involved with 
search committees for the new 
dean of Student Affairs, director of 
Student Activities, and career cen­
ter director.
GSA stays active during the 
summer and will be discussing sur­
vey results from last year’s gradu­
ate student survey, the university’s 
master plan, and our upcoming 
budget. We are always looking for 
your thoughts and ideas about ways 
to improve graduate student life, so 
please let us know what you think!

SPORTS COMMENTARYPens’ defense won’t win the Stanley Cup
PENS, from A10
will tear them up when 
Kunitz takes an unnecessary 
penalty. As for Ponikarovsky, 
the Pens brought him in to 
play aside Malkin to make 
the line stronger. But he 
hasn’t performed and doesn’t 
seem to have the fire to play 
on this team, nor the desire 
to. One goal and one assist in 
six games of the playoffs isn’t 
going to cut it. Ponikarovsky 
also had just one shot on goal 
in Saturday’s overtime game. 
He scored 50 points in the 
regular season, but he’s hav­
ing no impact in any of these 
games.
A lot of Pittsburghers have 
been complaining about Fl- 
eury’s goaltending recently. 
What they don’t understand 
is that half the time, it’s not 
Fleur/s fault. He’s not the 
best goaltender in the game 
and when the defense makes 
stupid mistakes, most goalies 
in the league are going to get 
burned. Most of the time he’s
doing the right things, like 
giving up long rebounds and 
hoping his defense controls 
the puck.
However, the Pens’ de­
fense tends to be lackluster 
and lets oncoming offensive 
players maintain possession. 
Fleury loses focus sometimes 
and gets flustered when he 
gives up easy goals, which 
is his main flaw. He’s got to 
keep his head up and realize 
that he’s a good goaltender 
and mistakes happen. No one 
is perfect, especially not him.
Now, I’m not saying that 
the Pens don’t have a shot 
to win the cup. With Malkin 
and Crosby, anything can 
happen. They can propel any 
team to stardom. With two 
overtime wins, the Pens can 
say that they’ve been battle- 
tested, and they’ve given up 
only one goal in overtime. 
But they need to get their de­
fense in the right mindset be­
fore thevy play the Caps, oth­
erwise they’ll lose that series 
in less than six games.

hind, most notably the Boston 
Red Sox, who need to make 
a decision quickly on their 
former star of all stars, David 
“Big Papi” Ortiz. Now I’m not 
a Spanish major, nor do I play 
one on TV, but after watching 
the sadness and frustration in 
Ortiz’s eyes after he struck out 
for the umpteenth time and 
was eventually pinch-hit for, 
I’m certain that “Big Papi” is 
Spanish for “Bruce Banner.”
There’s also been a lot 
of outrage among fans and, 
more inappropriately, com­
mentators on MLB.com about 
some controversial baseball 
over the past week. On Sat­
urday, a 12-inning affair be­
tween the Minnesota Twins 
and the Kansas City Royals 
ended when Twins shortstop 
J.J. Hardy bobbled a ground­
er but recovered in time to 
throw to second base. Roy­
als speedster Scott Podsed- 
nik was called out to end the 
game, which would have been 
fine — if he had actually been 
out. The naked eye, replays, 
radio and television announc­
ers from both teams, and pret­
ty much everyone but umpire 
Greg Gibson saw Podsednik 
slide in safely. Alas, Royals’ 
manager Trey Hillman’s argu­
ment was to no avail, and the 
game was over.
Earlier this week I wrote in 
my blog, “Jonas On Baseball,” 
about how it’s better when an 
umpire admits he’s wrong. It 
shows professionalism and it
Junior Alex Nemerov.sets up for a serve while junior doubles partner Bobby MacTaggart focuses for the next point. The pair helped lead the Tartans 
to victories over Case Western Reserve and Brandeis University.
TENNIS, from A10
(4), 6-3, to give the Tartans 
a 4-3 lead. Senior Jon Spero 
had a tough, grinding match 
against Case’s Sean Carr, 
but came out victorious in a 
third-set tiebreak, 6-3, 6-7 
(2), 10-4. Rounding out the 
fifth win was sophomore Jer­
emy King, making his singles 
debut, who easily won 6-1, 
6-3.
Despite their win over the 
Spartans, the Tartans were 
anxious going into their match 
against rival and third-ranked 
Emory. Since matches are 
played to decision, the Tartans 
ended their run at a UAA title 
with a 5-1 loss.
The lone win came from 
first doubles, with Muliawan 
and King winning three 
straight games after being
down 6-7.
“We were hanging on af­
ter doubles, but the momen­
tum just wasn’t there,” senior 
Niko Ljuboja said. “In singles, 
Emory was definitely sharper, 
but a couple of our guys could 
have pulled out wins if we 
played the matches out. We 
just need to maintain our fo­
cus for tomorrow if we want 
to do well.”
Spero added, “We really 
wanted to beat Emory but 
came up short. We played 
spectacular doubles, but they 
were a little too good at two 
and three. They have arguably 
the two best singles players in 
the whole country, so losses 
at the top two spots were un­
derstandable. I thought we 
played a good match, and 
I think it goes to show how 
strong Emory is after they beat
Wash. U. fairly comfortably.”
The Tartans entered their 
third-place match with high 
expectations against Brande­
is. Eager for redemption from 
Saturday’s loss, the Tartans 
quickly took the lead 2-1 af­
ter taking first and third dou­
bles. Muliawan and King won 
8-5, while Miller and Ljuboja 
slammed their opponents by 
the same score.
First off the courts was Mu­
liawan, who breezed by his 
opponent 6-3, 6-1, followed 
by Nemerov, who pulled out 
a 7-5, 6-1 win over Brandé­
is’ number-one player, Nick 
White.
Miller struggled a bit at 
fourth singles but gave the 
Tartans the needed fifth win, 
6-2, 5-7, 7-5. Spero and King 
were also up a set when play 
concluded, a small demon-
stration of why the Tartans 
are now ranked seventh in the 
nation.
“We really enjoyed host­
ing and it was a treat for the 
seniors,” Spero remarked. 
“We are looking forward to 
a home match against W & L 
next weekend, and if we win- 
that, it’s looking very good for 
us to host an NCAA regional 
on graduation weekend. We 
didn’t play our best tennis of 
the season, but we played to 
our seed and got the job done 
in both of the matches we 
needed to win.”
The Tartans will host their 
final match of the season 
against Washington and Lee 
University next Saturday at 12 
p.m.

shows dedication to the game 
and its values. No game is ever 
considered a good one, no 
matter how close, if it hinges 
on a blown call. Anyone who 
watched A.J. Pierzynski run 
down to first base after he 
struck out in the 2005 ALCS 
knows that; anyone who 
watched Gibson call Podsed­
nik out on Saturday knows it.
However, contrary to the 
belief of some “fans,” Gibson’s 
bad call was not because he is 
biased against the Royals. No 
umpire could ever do that and 
get away with it. No matter 
how unprofessional an um­
pire is or how bad of a call he 
makes, it will never have to do 
with bias or other such prefer­
ence. He just made a bad call, 
or at the very most, he’s just a 
bad ump.
Let it be known, though, 
that with the exception of 
some I cannot name (one 
rhymes with “Bad Bairchild”), 
most umps are good, profes­
sional umps.
The other controversy is 
over the Yankees’ Mark Teix- 
eira, who barreled hard into 
Angels catcher Bobby Wilson 
on a play at the plate on Fri­
day night. Wilson, who was 
in position to tag Teixeira 
out before the ball got away
from hirti, suffered a concus­
sion and a possible ankle in­
jury when Teixeira slammed 
into him full-force, Teixiera’s 
shoulder appearing to make 
contact with Wilson’s face 
mask. While Wilson had to be 
helped off the field and taken 
to the hospital, Teixeira didn’t 
look back after touching home 
plate and getting into the Yan­
kee’s dugout.
Was it unprofessional of 
him not to check on Wilson? 
No. It would have been very 
professional of him to go out 
there, but not doing so was 
probably a better choice given 
everyone’s sensitivity to inten­
tional collisions, nowadays. 
Teixeira’s best option to try 
to score was to barrel over 
Wilson, and he did it well. 
Nationwide, Teixiera is being 
ripped apart for knocking over 
Wilson, but people need to 
realize that although baseball 
is a gentleman’s game, hard- 
nosed baseball is good base­
ball. It’s not about courtesy 
and sunshine and flowers. It’s 
about winning and playing the 
game right.

Cricket club hosts tournament, spreads awareness about sportWhy the Pens won’t win the cup

, As many of you know, the 
Stanley Cup playoffs are in 
progress, with the Pittsburgh 
Penguins battling to defend 
their title. With no basket­
ball team and a disappointing 
baseball team, the city of Pitts­
burgh is looking to the Pens to 
give them reason to celebrate. 
Optimistic Pittsburgh fans 
may think that the Pens are 
the favorite to defend, but 
educated hockey fans will tell 
you that the Stanley Cup will 
not be parading through Pitts­
burgh anytime this year.
The main reason why the 
Pens won’t sniff the cup is one 
man: Sergei Gonchar. Yes, he 
is an above-average defender, 
but he isn’t even the best de­
fender on the team, let alone 
one of the best in the league. 
Gonchar has become slow and 
unreliable in the Pens’ zone. 
He lacks the ability to play 
physical defense, and when 
the time comes, he also lacks 
the ability to start a breakout. 
Yes, he. brings an offensive 
mind to the Pens’ formidable 
power play, but he needs to 
see less ice time because he 
hurts the team so much at full 
strength.
Overall, the Pens have too

Baseball has managed to 
make it through three weeks 
of the season with only one 
rainout, and it came on Fri­
day. That’s a pretty impressive 
feat — not that anyone but 
Mother Nature really had a 
say in the matter — when you 
consider that April weather 
tends to wreak havoc on 
baseball. In 2007, Cleveland’s 
entire opening series with the 
Seattle Mariners was snowed 
out, and the Indians ended 
up having to host their “home 
opener” in Milwaukee.
So April has been rela­
tively cooperative, at least 
weather-wise. But baseball 
is baseball, and nothing ever 
works out quite the way it’s 
supposed to; for every team 
that makes a remarkable 
comeback to win a game in 
the bottom of the ninth with 
clutch hitting, there’s it’s op­
ponent losing a game on bad 
pitching. Only rarely does 
a team blow a game only to 
say, “They beat us despite 
our best efforts. We made our 
pitches and they hit them; we
made our plays and they just 
beat us.”
The Pirates played their 
first two weeks like they were 
a real team, giving us that 
small glimmer of hope that 
maybe, just maybe, they’d 
finally put the right group of 
guys out on the field to mix 
the winning formula. After 
they swept the Reds on April 
15-17, the Pirates sat in sec­
ond place with a 7-5 record.
Then all hell broke loose. 
The Pirates played a gra­
cious host to the Brewers last 
Tuesday through Thursday, 
throwing meatballs across 
the plate and not scoring 
any runs, as they fell rather 
disgracefully 8-1, 8-0 and 
20-0. They then butchered 
any chance of climbing back 
over .500 for a third week in 
a row by dropping their first 
two games against Houston, 
4-3 and 5-2.
On the bright side, those 
losses were the first time this 
season that the Pirates had 
lost by less than six runs.
There’s still hope, though
— there’s always hope. Yogi

up. To start with, Chris Kunitz

no one else can. Lately, he’s 
been taking ridiculous pen­

Wrapping up an 
outstanding career 
with the track and 
field team, senior me­
chanical engineering 
major and thrower 
James Huljey was re­
cently named a 2010 
National Strength and 
Conditioning Associa­
tion (NSCA) Athlete 
of the Year. With this 
honor, Hulley became 
recognized as one of 
the top collegiate ath­
letes in the country for 
hard work and success 
in strength training 
and conditioning. Hul­
ley was also recently 
awarded Athlete of 
the Week honors by 
the University Athletic 
Association for his vic­
tories in the shot put 
and discus; he also set 
a school record in the 
shot put at the Tartans’ 
home meet on April
10. For all of the hard 
work that Hulley has 
been putting in to his 
training in the past few
years, receiving these 
awards is Very satisfy­
ing.
For a typical day of 
training, whether it is 
while he is^ in season 
or conditioning in the 
off-season, Hulley lifts 
in the mornings and 
participates in throw­
ing practices in the 
afternoon. While he 
does not have concrete 
plans in line for next 
year, Hulley is defi­
nitely looking forward 
to giving his body a 
much-needed break 
from eight years of 
intense bouts of exer­
cise.
Hulley notes that 
nutrition and recovery
¦ have been crucial in 
supporting his tough 
training regime since 
a rigorous academic 
schedule has been the 
main focus of his time 
at Carnegie Mellon as 
well.
•While he excels in 
all of the events that 
has competed in, Hul­
ley cites the shot put 
as his favorite. This
comes as no surprise, 
as Hulley will be com­
peting in the national 
championships for the 
shot put again next 
month. Having the op­
portunity to hone his 
precise technique is 
something that Hulley 
looks forward forgiv­
ing him an increased 
chance for victory at 
the highest level.
For his undergradu­
ate teammates, Hul­
ley has some parting 
words that should 
serve as positive mo­
tivation for them to 
maintain a determined 
and dedicated attitude 
as a student athlete: 
“Don’t work too hard 
if you don’t enjoy it. 
If I didn’t love train­
ing and competing, 
I wouldn’t be able to 
train like I do. You’re 
only an NCAA ath­
lete for four years, but 
you’re also only going 
to be an undergradu­
ate for four years. 
Whether it is athletics 
or anything else, do 
what you love.”

For the first time in Carne­
gie Mellon’s history, the men’s 
tennis team has achieved a 
national ranking of number 
seven. The Tartans geared up 
last weekend to host the Uni­
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) Championships after 
topping the previous seventh- 
ranked team, Kenyon College, 
a few weeks ago. Entering 
the UAAs as the third seed, 
the Tartans blew past Case 
Western Reserve University’s 
Spartans 6-3 to earn a spot in 
the semifinals against Emory 
University’s number-three 
Eagles. The Eagles stopped 
the Tartans short of compet­
ing for the title the next day 
with a decisive 5-1 win, but 
the Tartans rallied back to 
defeat Brandeis University 
the next day for third place, 
5-2. The Tartans improve to 
18-5 after this tennis-packed 
weekend.
surprising resistance the first 
day and found themselves at 
a 2-1 deficit after doubles 
play. The Spartans came 
out swinging and surprised 
the Tartans at first and third 
doubles, but the duo of ju­
niors Bobby MacTaggart and 
Alex Nemerov fought back to 
snatch a 8-5 win.
“We’ve played Case be­
fore, but they caught us off 
guard with some relentless 
doubles play,” Nemerov said. 
“I think everyone was moti­
vated to play better in singles 
because of it.”
Adding a few easy points 
to the total were senior James 
Muliawan, who topped his 
opponent 6-2, 6-0 at third 
singles, and first-year Duke 
Miller, who finished just min­
utes later with a 6-2,6-3 win

Prose, poetry dazzle audiences Everything you need to know
Senior reading symbolizes four years of effort and growth About messing up and graduating confidently
The swarm of plaid button-downs and thick- 
rimmed glasses around Baker Hall last Friday night 
was a sure sign that something literary was going 
down. And sure enough, prose was recited, poetry 
performed, and bows dipped as the creative writing 
seniors of Carnegie Mellon performed a final reading 
together.
At 8 p.m., a group of seniors, faculty, 'and friends 
gathered in the Adamson Wing to listen to the 
collective work of senior writers. Before the 
performance, sophomore English’ major Elizabeth 
Harbaugh confessed high expectations of the 
upcoming reading. “I expect to be dazzled," she 
declared. “No. I demand to be dazzled.”
And dazzling did occur. The reading began with 
senior creative writing major Tom Pike presenting 
samples of his poetry, which prompted both laughs 
and serious silences from the audience with its 
varied themes — among them, the origin of Fig 
Newtons.
Each student approached the podium and greeted 
the audience in their, own unique way, before 
presenting their work and welcoming the next 
reader to the stage. Themes varied from the origins 
of life and snack foods to aggravating traveling 
partners and the proper way to dig a ditch.
Those performing were not lirhited to English-related 
majors: All seniors interested in poetry or prose 
were welcome to share their work. Senior Su Chu, a

statistics major, presented her poem “Synch Sister.” 
Describing the themes and inspiration behind her 
work, she said: “I feel very strongly about people, 
and a lot of my work is inspired by the dynamics 
between the people who are close to me.”
As writer after writer stepped up to the podium, one 
got a sense of the finality of the event. That night, 
students and faculty came together to acknowledge 
the effort and hard work that occurred over the past 
four years.
Senior creative writing major John Lehmann felt the 
same sense of culmination at the event. “It’s good 
to hear everyone one last time — just for fun.” He 
remarked. “One last time outside of classes to see 
how something floats, and a chance to make a list of 
people I’m going to send my work to for criticism.”
The reading on Friday was the perfect way to 
celebrate four years of hard work, revision, and 
growth by sharing final words and work with fellow 
students and the mentors who guided each draft 
and scribble over the years. While this reading 
symbolizes the ending chapter for these writers at 
Carnegie Mellon, it also serves as an introduction 
to the future and their upcoming journeys to 
professional success.

Tales from abroad: Switzerland
Snowy mountain peaks, crystal streams, and cheese fondue complete the Swiss experience
It was the end of summer, and before I knew it I was 
no longer on the streets of Manhattan. A bus ride, 
an eight-hour flight, and a train ride later, instead of 
tall skyscrapers and bustling tourists I found myself 
surrounded by tall mountains, green open fields, a huge 
lake, and even some stray cows. I was in Switzerland. 
After a 45-minute train ride from Geneva, I reached 
my final destination, Lausanne — the second largest 
city on Lake Geneva in the French-speaking region of 
Switzerland. It was a Sunday afternoon and everything 
was closed: shops, restaurants, and grocery stores. The 
pristine and tranquil surroundings felt eerie after having 
left New York City the previous day. Moreover, how could 
there not be a restaurant open to find lunch?
After getting settled into my new apartment and 
meeting my suitemates — exchange students from 
London, Japan, and Tunisia — I prepared for the next 
day, which was the first day of language classes. Before I 
knew it, I was meeting ERASMUS (European exchange) 
students from Italy, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, 
Germany, the UK, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. So 
many more new languages to learn!
Many students say “I really want to study abroad, but
I can’t get credit for the classes I need and I won’t 
graduate on time!" It wasn’t easy, but as a junior in 
electrical and computer engineering, I knew I wanted
to study abroad and at the same time not fall behind 
academically. I was in Switzerland during Fall 2009 
at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) 
and I still managed to get credit for my ECE classes 
(Semiconductors, Analog Circuits, Signals and Systems, 
and Electromechanics). The catch — my classes were 
all in French, and the last time I took a French class? 
Almost four years ago as a junior in high school.
Within the first week of the three-week summer 
language classes, I found myself hiking in the Swiss 
Alps. A Swiss friend from EPFL was so hospitable 
that he invited a group of us to go hiking. After a few 
water breaks, time snacking on Swiss chocolate, and 
a grueling three hours of walking uphill through the 
mountain, we finally reached the top and the view 
was worth it. There was a huge lake — Lake Louvie
— surrounded by green fields, and the mountain peaks 
on the other side were covered with snow, even during 
the middle of summer. There was even a quintessential 
Swiss log cabin at the top that served fondue. We took 
a stroll around the entire lake and I could not believe 
the gorgeousness of it all. I was in the middle of the 
Swiss Alps — snow, lake, mountains — the works. The 
descent was much easier and took us less than two 
hours. There were also hydro-powered dams at the base 
of the mountain area, since there were many waterfalls 
and streams. You can literally just drink the water from
the streams on the mountain since it was cleaner than 
the water in a bottle of Evian (which was ironically a city 
across the lake from Lausanne).
If hiking in Switzerland wasn’t cliche enough, our Swiss 
friend invited us to his house for some traditional Swiss 
fondue, which his mom arranged for us. His parents 
were extremely friendly and hospitable, although they 
didn’t really speak any English. Needless to say, dining 
table conversation was a challenge. I don’t think I have 
ever concentrated so much during dinner. The entire 
time, we were speaking in French. His parents even 
began discussing local politics... in French. I was in the 
middle of Switzerland, in a Swiss family's house, eating 
fondue as they discussed politics in French. It was all 
too surreal. I was waiting for some French teacher to 
push the stop button and ask listening comprehension 
questions such as “What was the main topic of this 
conversation? What was the father's opinion? What did 
the son tell the mother in response to the argument?"
But it never came. This was real. Nevertheless, the 
cheese fondue was amazing. What a satisfying end to a 
beautiful hiking weekend abroad.

Immature lyrics limit Nash’s fan base
Sophomore album syndrome plagues My Best Friend Is You
There’s no doubt that when Kate Nash jumped in the 
music scene, she made a splash. Riding the wave of 
the post-Lily Allen MySpace craze, her debut Made 
of Bricks peaked at number one on the UK charts.
Although slightly less popular in the U.S., she made 
an impression with “Merry Happy,” her fifth single 
and the only hit off her debut album. With such a 
successful debut, expectations for her next album 
rose.
Nash’s sophomore album My Best Friend Is You isn’t 
so much a disappointment as a compilation of hit- 
and-miss songs. Half ’60s girl group, half fem-rock, 
Nash has girlhood covered as she sings about mean 
boys, nasty girls, and a blend of self-loathing and girl 
power.
But that’s just the problem: It’s as if Nash hasn’t 
grown up. The 22-year-old is still stuck on the woes 
of the young, love-struck girl. And although this type 
of music appeals to her fan base, mainly girls and 
young women, she fails to gain a larger audience.
While her single “Do-Wah-Doo” draws from ’60s girl 
groups, it’s similar to the poppy, girly songs that 
were popular from Made of Bricks. The song is a 
good one, with catchy rhythms and clever rhyming,

Kate Nash set the bar high with her first album 
but disappointed with her second. The singer has 
yet to show maturity through her music.
but it’s one of the few on the album.
If you’ve only heard the single and first two tracks, 
“Paris” and “Kiss that Grrrl," you might be misled 
into thinking the rest of the album is as brilliant. All 
three songs are reminiscent of Nash’s first album. 
With upbeat pop undertones, the songs soar and 
their vibrancy is undeniable.
At best, the album caters 
to the crowd of teens and 
20-somethings who relate 
to Nash’s words.
The only other catchy song, although debatably 
so, is “Mansion Song,” the eighth track, which is a 
combination of the worst song you’ve ever heard 
and the most female-empowering lyrics. The end 
result is an intriguing tune — or rather, an angry 
rant — against the treatment of female groupies 
by male rockstars and the absurdity of some 
21st-century women. Perhaps this is the one song on 
the album in which Nash seems willing to face her 
own maturity.
Some less than successful tracks include “I Just 
Love You More” and “I Hate Seagulls.” The former 
song-draws from Karen-0 of The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, 
but Nash only provides loud screeching noises 
and repetitive words without purpose. The latter is 
simply a slow number that lists the things she hates. 
Perhaps she meant for the song to be meaningful, 
but it comes off as whiny and fails to catch the 
listener’s interest.
Nash’s experimentation with sounds and different 
styles is confusing and lacks direction as she jumps 
from genre to genre. She struggles witl^what she 
wants to say, and more often than not the message 
gets misunderstood. While she tries so desperately 
to be taken seriously, she remains the girly pop star 
who laments the trials and troubles of young women.
At best, the album caters to the crowd of teens and 
20-somethings who relate to Nash’s words. At worst, 
it’s just another byproduct of the sophomore album 
syndrome.

On Nico Muhly
In the hype of new music, it is often too easy to forget the 
small players that make an album great. People do not 
stay abreast with the most popular producers or the most 
revolutionary sound engineers. I doubt anyone can name the 
new-faced composer who has taken over music in the last 
year. People should be more aware of the faces behind their 
favorite albums. People should know about Nico Muhly.
Muhly is a Western composer who has been responsible for 
some of the most interesting music this decade. The proof is 
in his album Mothertongue, with its highly experimental work 
on tracks like “Skip Town.”
Muhly has a wonderful style that cannot be replicated, much 
less described in words. He is one of this decade’s most 
important musicians, and unfortunately, no one knows about 
him.
Many people would point to Grizzly Bear’s Veckatimist as one 
of this year’s better albums, and looking forward, many people 
are also anticipating The National’s new album, High Violet, 
to be the rock album of the decade. Muhly has, predictably 
enough, a distinct presence on both of these albums.
It would be no small exaggeration to say that Muhly is 
responsible for the compositional brilliance of Veckatimist. 
In terms of The National, Muhly produced one of the most 
innovative arrangements ever heard with his work in the 
song “So Far Around the Bend” on The National’s Dark Was 
the Night. Looking at High Violet, we can expect much of 
the same magnificence with the track “Vanderlyle Crybaby 
Geeks,” thanks to Muhly’s distinct retooling.
People should be more aware of the faceless composers and 
musicians behind the greatest albums of the last decade. 
When thinking of The National and Grizzly Bear, people should 
think of Muhly. Most great bands I know have been helped 
along by a brilliant composer at some point or another; it’s 
time that we look at these composers in their own right.

Squirrel Hill offers up delectable desserts
Get your taste of frosted cupcakes, strawberry pies, frozen yogurt, and other goodies
Squirrel Hill has always been a convenient place for 
Carnegie Mellon students to get food and groceries. The 
neighborhood is close enough to campus that the trip 
is within walking distance; however, it is far enough to 
still take students away from the university atmosphere. 
With various restaurants, eateries, and cafés, one should 
also take time to remember the various sweet dessert 
options in Squirrel Hill that one can grab to go.
With so many places in such a small area, feel free to go 
to different places on Murray Avenue and compare the 
classics.
Dozen — Dozen has always had a permanent place in 
Squirrel Hill dessert discussions. Located conveniently 
near the corner of Forbes Avenue and Murray Avenue, 
one can just go in and grab a cupcake to go — it’s 
that easy. Dozen is no longer just a cupcake shop, 
however, but a full-fledged bakery. From somewhat 
classic cupcakes to sumptuous-looking cinnamon 
rolls, the business is growing. Now, Dozen Bake Shops 
are all around Pittsburgh. Classics like vanilla vanilla, 
characterized by powdered sugar butter cream icing, will 
always hold promise. If you are a chocolate person, try 
the vegan mostess cupcake, a vegan chocolate cupcake 
with buttercream filling and frosted with chocolate 
ganache.
Gullifty's Restaurant — Priding itself on a selection 
of award-winning desserts, Gullifty’s is truly the 
ultimate American restaurant. From humongous cakes 
to ostentatious key lime pies and different kinds of 
cheesecake, most diners are getting a meal rather than 
a simple dessert. Even if this restaurant is known for its 
desserts, the regular menu at Gullifty’s is definitely worth 
choosing from as well.
Gluuteny — Gluuteny is a wheat- and dairy-free 
bakery located right next to Giant Eagle. Although these 
treats are definitely not the desserts that most students 
are used to, from sugar cookies to brownies to bread, 
Gluuteny has something good for every eater. All of this 
bakery’s goodies are homemade, baked right at the 
store’s location.
Allegro Hearth Bakery — Hands down, this hearth 
sells some of the best breads in Pittsburgh. As for 
desserts, what you see is really what you get. From the 
shop’s in-house dessert tasting, the vanilla cupcake 
rates the highest. All cakes and bars are moist, 
sweet, fragrant, and messy — be ready to lick buttery 
buttercream off your fingers after you finish. If the sugar 
is getting to be too much, the salty baked baguettes 
sliced and sold in small bags by the register can relax 
your overwhelmed taste buds.
Rose Tea Café — There is a reason the Rose Tea Café 
is packed with Asians: Many students at Carnegie 
Mellon say they serve the best bubble tea, hands down. 
Since we are only talking about the classics, the. café’s 
black milk tea will always hit the spot. One can walk 
in for a meal or just get bubble tea. Either way, the 
bubbles are made perfectly al dente, not too cooked or 
undercooked. However, if you are only getting bubble 
tea, make sure you have cash ready.
RazzyFresh Frozen Yogurt — RazzyFresh has 
some of the most-talked-about frozen yogurt around 
Pittsburgh. Why? Because they simply sell the 
best-tasting frozen yogurt. The same cannot be said 
about the condiments or the fruits chopped down to 
such a small scale that they really lose their purpose. 
Nonetheless, the self-serve style lets you get just what 
you want. At the end of the line, you can weigh your cup 
and pay. That way, you can get as much or as little of 
the condiments as you want. Taste aside, these yogurts 
are the most affordable as well. The only improvement 
I would suggest is a larger cup with a better lid. That 
way, customers can take more of the original tart frozen 
yogurt to stock up in a fridge.

Chemers’ book delves into dramaturgy
Ghost Light explains how a dramaturg balances the different aspects of the theater process
This past Wednesday, students, faculty, and community 
members alike gathered in the Carnegie Mellon 
bookstore to celebrate the release of a faculty member’s 
book. Michael Mark Chemers, an assistant professor 
in the School of Drama and the founder and director of 
the school’s bachelor’s degree program in dramaturgy, 
released his newest book, Ghost Light: An Introductory 
Handbook for Dramaturgy.

Chemers explains the intricate studies of dramaturgy 
majors. Because it involves theater history and practice, 
critical theory, and world history, a dramaturgy major is 
an essential component of a production’s creative team.
includes an explanation of the critical theories necessary 
to analyze texts associated with dramaturgy. The second 
part of the book explores the practice of dramaturgy 
and explains how the dramaturgy major can be used to 
collaborate with those involved with a production. The 
third part of the book is a guide for students: It includes 
a series of exercises and assignments that are classroom 
appropriate.
Considered by many to be an essential book for all 
theater practitioners, Chemers’ book explains to readers 
exactly what dramaturgy is and what a dramaturg, or 
someone who studies dramaturgy, does.
All in all, it seems quite appropriate that a major like this 
one has found its way to Carnegie Mellon. In the theater 
world, dramaturgy is considered the science of drama. 
Those who study dramaturgy are involved in every step 
of the creative process, from directing to costuming to 
editing to cutting. A dramaturgy major learns the ropes 
of the entire theater process and uses that knowledge in
In the theater world, 
dramaturgy is considered the

It’s always exciting when a Carnegie Mellon faculty 
member is honored through publication, but it’s 
especially wonderful to see a genre of theatrical studies 
emerge here at Carnegie Mellon. Hopefully, universities 
and students around the world will realize the benefits of 
dramaturgy and include this text in their study.

Documentary Thursday continues 
this week with The Cove, a 2009 
Academy Award-winning film. The 
documentary is about dolphins, 
though not at all in a cute way, 
but rather in a much sadder and 
tragic way. The crew infiltrates a 
cove near Taijii, Japan to reveal 
horrific instances of animal abuse 
perpetrated by the Japanese whaling 
industry. The movie follows Ric 
O’Barry, who famously trained the 
Flipper dolphins, as he documents 
the dolphin hunting operations 
that some Japanese fishermen try 
desperately to hide from the public 
eye.

Pink Prison

TBD
It’s TBA time, folks. The movie this 
semester is a dreamy Danish erotic 
film for women, though men will surely 
enjoy it. Pink Prison follows a news 
reporter as she breaks into a men’s 
penitentiary to win a bet. That may 
sound like a flimsy plot, but this flick 
was actually a big success overseas 
and turns a whole bunch of porn- 
film perceptions upside down in the 
process. Be sure to take your friends 
if you go watch Pink Prison, because 
if there’s anything that will bring a 
group of guys and girls together, it’s a 
good old-fashioned Carnegie Mellon 
tradition.
Transamerica
Saturday, May 1

ALLIES partners with AB Films this

Huffman stars in this 2005 dramedy as 
a transgendered woman who goes on 
a road trip with her long-lost 17-year- 
old son, whom she fathered before 
she became a woman. Crazy, ain’t 
it? The movie received fairly positive 
reviews, including many for Huffman’s 
performance as the lead. The mother/ 
son road trip acts as a personal journey 
for both, where they experience self- 
discovery and all that other mushy 
stuff. So if you’re into good films that 
reference vaginoplasty, this is one for 
you.

In Jim Carrey’s only — and hopefully 
last — foray into suspense thrillers, 
he stars as an animal control officer 
married to Virginia Madsen, a cake 
shop owner. Carrey discover a book 
in a used-book store written by a 
man obsessed with the number 23 
and, along with the book, inherits the 
author’s obsession. The movie itself 
received mixed reviews, as Carrey is 
often perceived as a strictly comedic 
author. Personally, if Jim Carrey just 
performed Liar, Liar on stage for the 
rest of his life, I think everyone would 
be perfectly happy.

Tips and tricks to overcome stress during finals
Picking the right study spot and planning your week are essential steps in dealing with exams
by Meela Dudley | Pillbox Editor
With the semester nearing its end and summer on the 
horizon, students at Carnegie Mellon are racked with 
anticipation for their up-and-coming summer vacations. 
However, before our focus can switch from electrical 
circuits to sunblock and boogie boarding, students have 
one last hurdle to overcome: Final exams.
While for some, final exams are a chance to change that 
less-than-satisfactory mid-semester grade, for many 
others, finals are a stress-inducing burden intended 
only to compromise the hard work done thus far in the 
semester. Whether you will be regarding these exams as 
your saving grace or your ultimate inconvenience, use 
this guide to make sure you pass your exams with flying 
colors and make your transition into summer a pleasant 
one.
Study strategies
For many, the hardest thing about studying for a major 
exam is getting started. Will you take the long route and 
begin studying weeks in advance, dedicating an hour a 
day to your progress, or will you take the procrastination
¦ route and cram all your studying into the 48 hours before 
the exam? Whatever your intentions, make sure that 
you clearly map out your expected study schedule on 
some form of a calendar. Having all of your study plans
Prepare for finals week with 
these quick tips:
1 Map out your study schedule on a calendar.
2 Make sure your space has the study necessities: a table, a chair, 
a hole puncher, a printer, a stapler, and access to food, drink, and the 
occasional nap.
3 Make sure to maintain a regulated 
sleeping schedule while studying for exams.
4 Limit your amount of caffeine intake 
during the early stages of your 
studying.
5 Motivate yourself by planning a party or picnic after finals week to look forward to.
clearly laid out before you will ensure that you don’t miss 
anything, and it will also make it more convenient for 
you to plan study parties, schedule group meetings, or 
scribble down all possible review sessions.
Sometimes, however, the issue isn’t a lack of planning, 
but rather a matter of location. With so many dedicated 
students at Carnegie Mellon, it can often be difficult to 
find a study location that truly is your own.
Firstly, be sure to avoid"certain places. While your 
bedroom may seem like the obvious first choice for study 
sessions, keep in mind that unless you:re occupying a 
single, your roommate or roommates may be thinking 
the same thing. Furthermore, your dorm room is chock 
full of study distractions — how many times have 
you intended to study or complete an assignment in 
your room and instead been distracted by your room’s 
organization, the attractive “quick” nap, or your various 
forms of electronic entertainment? All in all, dorm rooms 
are a place for sleeping and hanging out with friends, 
and it is always dangerous to mix these pleasures with 
work.
While the floor lounge may seem like an attractive 
study option — it’s conveniently located, all of your 
friends are there, and the large space is comforting 
and non-threatening — think again. Depending on 
how many people also consider the lounge the perfect
study option, this room can tend to get a little noisy.
Also, friends are unfortunately the worst of the study 
distractions; while you may think that grouping together 
is a beneficial way to work through your exam outlines, 
you will realize just how often a friendly pair can get 
sidetracked. Moreover, most lounges, depending on your 
dorm, do not have desks or tables, and this can often 
inconvenience certain studiers.
While Hunt Library would seem like the most obvious 
place for studying to be done, this too may be a common 
exam misconception. Hunt offers students a plethora 
of study environments depending on which floor one 
may choose to occupy. While the first floor may seem 
like an attractive option with its Maggie Murph Café 
convenience and selection of tables, it is also the loudest 
of the library floors. Students who choose to study on 
the first floor often work in groups and talk loudly among 
themselves. Also, with all the hustle and bustle of the 
only 24-hour eating location on campus, you can bet that 
the busy atmosphere is incredibly distracting for some.
The basement of Hunt can actually be a good study 
option, but be aware that the chances of your reserving 
one of the private study rooms on this floor are slim to 
none during the weeks before finals. The basement, 
unfortunately, offers no natural light. While one may not 
immediately assume this to be a big deal, some students 
often lose track of time in windowless locations. The sun

The third floor of Hunt Library provides a quiet study environment that works to some students' advantage but
proves to be too quiet for others.

---------------------------------------------------

Looking forward to a group get-together in the warm 
weather can act as an'incentive for you to get through 
your studying smoothly and efficiently, and to own your 
exams come finals week.
Motivation can also be found in the form of reward. If you 
are questioning your motivation to study efficiently and 
master a subject, make yourself a bargain. If upon taking 
your exam you feel as though you knew the material 
sufficiently well and studied the subject as well as you 
personally could, then reward yourself! Throw a huge 
end-of-the-year party at your apartment or a friend’s 
house, take your best friends out for dinner on the Strip, 
or treat yourself to a delicious Rita's ice in Squirrel Hill.
If none of these options seem appealing, then why not 
just veg out for three straight days? Catch up on sleep 
and your favorite television shows, and rejoice in your 
complete lack of drive to do anything.
While the impending exams may seem daunting, 
remember that your entire experience will be completely 
dependent on your level of preparation. How stressful 
your exams will be is up to you. Start brainstorming, 
outlining, and highlighting as soon as possible to ensure 
your own exam security. By putting these tips and tricks 
to use, you can ensure that your exam experience will be 
as painless as possible.

movements when you have, in fact, spent way too much

The third floor of Hunt offers an entirely different study 
atmosphere and is almost entirely silent, save for a few 
snores from exhausted studiers. While crouching in a 
cubicle in this muted area may be your cup of tea, for 
many students the third floor is actually just plain eerie. 
“I can never study on the third floor,” said first-year 
physics major Sam Carp. "The kids on that floor scare 
me. I feel like the whole floor is a quiet, high-tension 
hostage situation, and any second someone is going to 
snap and there will be chaos."
The fourth floor of Hunt is another group study floor that 
has cubicles as well as a few tables. While there really 
isn’t anything significantly negative to say about this 
floor, let it be known that the space is extremely limited
— if you’re planning on making this your study location, 
you had better find the optimal time for occupying a 
table or cubicle on this floor.
Looking for some unconventional study area choices? If 
you happen to be a first-year, the RAs in your dorm can 
surely suggest some lesser-known areas for studying. 
The RAs in Morewood E Tower hung a list of their 
favorite study areas for their residents: The list included 
the Cathedral of Learning, The University of Pittsburgh’s 
Hillman Library, Starbucks, Kiva Han, and the Panther 
Hollow Inn.
Wherever your study location choice, make sure your 
space has the study necessities: a table, a chair, a hole 
puncher, a printer, a stapler, and access to food, drink, 
and the occasional nap. While the warm weather may 
convince you to throw down a towel or soft comforter 
and camp out on the Cut or in Schenley Park, beware as
these areas tend to be extremely busy and distracting. 
Make sure that you maintain a regulated sleep schedule 
while studying for exams. Whether you are a fan of 
the short bursts of studying followed by the refreshing 
two-hour nap, or the 12-hour split, make sure that your 
body is properly adjusted to your schedule. Also 
keep in mind that your sleep 
schedule will probably 
continue into your ¦ exam |
week, so make sure 
that your sleeping 
patterns are not 
inconvenient for 
your scheduled 
testing times.
Limit your amount of caffeine 
intake during the early stages 
of your studying. Too much 
caffeine can throw off your sleep |
schedule, induce headaches, and 
make you dependent. Instead, f|
save the caffeine for when you 
really need it; that*way you can 
be sure that your double-shot 
espresso will pull through for you 
during your last-minute 24-hour cram 
session.
Rewarding your hard work
While looking forward to activities 
scheduled after exams may seem 
like the perfect distraction, it can, 
in fact, be extremely beneficial.
Feeling largely unmotivated to 
study for exams? Plan an after-finals 
barbeque or picnic in Schenley Park 
and invite all of your friends on Facebook

Real music, new sound
Open your ears to this summer’s sounds of music
It has been a great year in music so far. Many of 
the award shows gave us something to talk about 
and something to look forward to for next year, a 
few artists released comeback albums, and several 
people did some wild and crazy antics that may 
have either boosted their popularity or sent them 
to the bottom of the charts. In either case, the year 
is far from over, and the changes in music and 
weather have many anticipating the music scene 
for the summer months. Summer music is what you 
hear most — what people play in the car with the 
windows down, what is blasting from the boom box 
or headphones as they lay out on the beach, or what 
is playing from their iHome as they just hang out on 
the patio.
This summer, we can look forward to more 
album releases from various artists: -American 
Idol runner-up Clay Aiken, Christina Aguilera,
The Cringe, Hanson, Lil Jon, The Roots, Teenage 
Fanclub, Villagers, Ozzy Osbourne, Eminem, M.I.A., 
T.I., Stars, American Hi-Fi, Sarah McLachlan, and 
many others. CDs are released every Tuesday, 
so check when your favorite artists are releasing 
albums. Many haven’t had an album in a while, and 
. others are steadily producing. In any case, there will 
be a plethora of music to listen to this summer.
If you are not the CD-buying type and more of the 
concert-going type, there are a bunch of music 
festivals across the country to take part in. Some are 
pretty costly and others are free. If you happen to be 
in the Chillicothe, 111. area around the end of May, 
you can celebrate Memorial Day weekend at the 
Summer Camp Music Festival. Artists such as STS9, 
Yonder Mountain String Band, Keller Williams, Steel 
Pulse, Family Groove, Backyard Fire Tire, The New 
Mastersounds, Dumpstaphunk, and many others are 
scheduled to be in attendance. The three-day pass 
costs $150, a pre-party pass is $20, and there are 
VIP upgrades of various values. You can partake in 
a bunch of different workshops, and there is even a 
Kids’ Camp for the younger attendees — or maybe 
the older ones with a young spirit.
In Quincy, Wash., visit the Gorge from May 29 to 
May 31 for the Sasquatch Music Festival. Not only

4. To be co-hosted by Steve Harvey and Nephew 
Tommy, this festival has scheduled some of the 
greatest names to take the stage. The three-day 
event takes place in the Superdome, and you can 
expect performances from Mary J. Blige; Alicia 
Keys; Janet Jackson; Jill Scott; Trey Songz; Charlie 
Wilson; Keri Hilson; Gladys Knight; Earth, Wind & 
Fire; Monica; LL Cool J; and so many others. And if 
that doesn’t get you going, there are empowerment 
seminars scheduled by Sheryl Lee Ralph, Rev. A1 
Sharpton, Steve Harvey, Hill Harper, and Tom Joyner, 
to name a few.
Many things happen in music every day, but the 
summer of 2010 is looking promising. Many artists 
have come out of hiding and are bringing back a 
sound we haven’t heard in a while or have never 
heard before. Take a chance and open your ears; get 
out and listen to the sounds of summer music.

Your summer will be wet in every way. Rain will leak through 
the seams of your house, the lining of your jacket, and the 
soles of your shoes. Your fish tank will soak your living room. 
You will yearn for the desert.
Your friend will invite you on a road trip. Somewhere in 
Montana you will find a boarded-up town, break into what 
was once a theater, and re-enact Richard III on the dusty 
stage. The ghost will be real.
As hard as you might try, you will be unable to escape 
Pittsburgh. The local iron and steel will bind you to the 
bridges and skyscrapers as if your body were a magnet. You 
will give up and don a Stillers jersey.
You will arrive at your internship to realize it pays twice as 
much as you had expected. You will also realize they gave it 
to someone else.
Youwill be employed as a barista. Try as you might, you will 
never be hipster enough: Your jeans will be too loose and 
you won’t know any of the correct obscure bands. Each 
night, you will lack the motivation to even cut yourself.
You will move 2500 miles away from a friend. The distance 
might actually hurt.
You will fly to Iceland to go volcano climbing. The beauty of 
the landscape will consume you. You will stay forever and 
never be missed.
You will visit San Francisco and have sex with a one-legged 
woman. Afterwards, you will notice the tattoo on her shoulder 
that says “Once, Always.”
To plan your summer you will visit a fortune teller, who 
will advise you to base your summer adventures on this 
horoscope.
Your summer will be exactly one-third as awesome as you 
currently expect. Adjust your expectations accordingly.
Your summer job as a communications expert will involve 
you learning Morse code. Another invaluable skill for your 
résumé.
Yoti will discover that you are actually a dragonfly. This will 
concern you greatly, but you will return to Carnegie Mellon in 
the fall with a renewed motivation.

the originals.
Angel Gonzalez | Photo Staff
This past Saturday, the men of The Originals made a special guest 
appearance- in-Wearr €ommons at a-l>G Late Night event. The group 
sang a medley of some classic Originals covers, including the crowd 
favorite "Roll to Me." The group then provided a series of karaoke 
soloists with the background tracks for songs like "Larger than 
Life" and "Stacy's Mom," using only their voices. A cappella groups 
Soundbytes and Joyful Noise also performed at the event.
