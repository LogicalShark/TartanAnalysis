Laptops: They’re small, ef-
? cient, and currently adorn 
the ? rst ? oor of Hunt Library. 
Their owners are typing, 
stooped over, with some bit-
ing their nails, even though it’s 
Friday and the ? rst week back 
to school. Yet it has become a 
necessity rather than a luxury 
to own a laptop while attend-
ing college. It is the future, 
and Carnegie Mellon takes the 
lead in computer-based dis-
covery as the No. 1 graduate 
program in computer science 
as determined by U.S. News 
and World Report in 2010.
One such discovery stems 
from Carnegie Mellon’s very 
own Online Learning Initia-
tive (OLI). The OLI currently 
offers a slew of free public 
online courses, from Modern 
Biology to Logic & Proofs to 
Chemistry. The site’s headline 
gives its purpose as, “[…] to 
enact the kind of dynamic, 
? exible, and responsive in-
struction that fosters learn-
ing.” And although one may 
think it is just supplemen-
tary materials, that would be 
wrong. In fact, the OLI builds 
a foundation for a nationwide 
goal to improve learning in in-
troductory courses. 
Last year, the OLI at Car-
negie Mellon was granted $4 
million from the Bill & Melin-
da Gates Foundation, Lumina 
Foundation for Education, 
and the Hewlett Foundation 
to develop educational oppor-
tunities.
In an article published by 
The Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation, the state of Washing-
ton has vowed to offer online 
materials as text. It comes 
as no surprise that the OLI’s 
free public materials are on 
the corkboard. Students who 
have taken Modern Chem-
istry II will be familiar with 
the Virtual Lab, a Java-based 
web environment to simulate 
experiments that one can per-
form in a physical lab. In 2010, 
over 100,000 experiments us-
ing the online virtual lab were 
performed across the globe.
Hannah Wirtshafter, a ju-
nior science and humanities 
scholar, described her expe-
rience with the virtual lab. “I 
would say it was both helpful 
and overly frustrating. The 
actual logistics of using the 
program — drag and drop, 
right click this, left click this, 
etc. — were annoying and un-
necessary.”
The Virtual Lab was ? rst 
created in 1999, written by 
Carnegie Mellon computer sci-
ence undergraduates, and is 
currently maintained by pro-
fessor Dave Yaron’s research 
group in the Department of 
Chemistry.
“Despite this student’s 
frustration, the Virtual Lab 
has been shown in studies to 
be very bene? cial in student 
learning and understanding. 
Our goal is to help motivate 
students and make chemistry 
exciting by connecting con-
cepts to real world applica-
tions,” said Michael Karabinos, 
director of the Chemcollective 
and part of Yaron’s group.
Another initiative of the 
OLI gained popularity in 
2009, when Carnegie Mel-
lon students were given the 
opportunity to take an accel-
erated (six-week) statistics 
course. The bulk of the course

Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day, falling annually on the 
third Monday of January, 
represents more than just 
a three-day weekend to the 
Carnegie Mellon campus. 
Observed nationwide since 
2000, the holiday encour-
ages people to re? ect on the 
past, speci? cally the Civil 
Rights Movement, and to 
consider King’s messages 
in the context of current 
times. This year, Carnegie 
Mellon is hosting a range of 
events in observance of the 
holiday and of the legacy of 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr.
With subjects ranging 
from King’s life to social 
justice along with activities 
encompassing both formal 
lectures and poetry slams, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day celebra-
tions offer something for 
everyone. Events begin at 
12:30 p.m., and afternoon 
classes have been canceled 
so that students and faculty 
can participate. 
“It lets people go to the 
events in a frame of mind 
that is relaxing and not 
stressful and to get some-
thing out of the events,” 
said Natalie French, a junior 
civil and environmental en-
gineering major. “It is really 
important to be aware 
and able to partici-
pate.”
Today’s activities kick off 
at 12:30 p.m. with a School 
of Drama tribute to King and 
diversity at Carnegie Mel-
lon in the University Center 
(12:30–1:30 p.m., Rangos 
Hall). Afterwards, there 
will be a presentation of the 
“Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
Writing Awards” (1:30–2:30 
p.m., McConomy Auditio-
rium), in which students 
from Carnegie 
Mellon and 
local high schools will share 
their “personal narratives 
dealing with individual ex-
periences with racial differ-
ence and discrimination.” 
The students are re-
cipients of writing awards 
sponsored by the Carnegie 
Mellon Creative Writing 
Program, Student Affairs, 
and the Of? ce of the Presi-
dent.” A more informal Po-

Every year during spring 
break, students accepted 
into the Initiating Meaning-
ful Pittsburgh and Qatar Ties 
(IMPAQT) program travel 
to Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar 
campus to interact with local 
students while socially and 
culturally experiencing the 
country. Through an initiative 
of Housing and Dining Servic-
es, however, all students will 
now have a unique chance to 
learn about Carnegie Mellon’s 
partner campus without even 
leaving Pittsburgh. Premier-
ing in March, the Qatar Room 
will be centrally located in a 
dining space in Resnik House 
known as the “pod.” The room 
will offer glimpses of student 
life in Doha, Qatar and feature 
programs and activities be-
tween the two campuses. The 
room will also enable open 
communication through the 
use of programming and vid-
eo conferencing.
The idea ? rst originated 
when Kim Abel, director of 
Housing and Dining Services, 
listened to a talk by Renee 
Camerlengo, associate dean 
of Student Affairs, about the 
IMPAQT program between 
Carnegie Mellon and Qatar. 
Students who apply and are 
accepted into the program 
begin an 18-month long com-
mitment culminating in a 
spring break trip to Qatar, as 
well as assisting in selecting 
the next group of students. 
Inspired, Abel spoke to both 
Camerlengo and Dean Tucker 
of Carnegie Mellon Qatar 
(CMU-Q) about the possibil-
ity of a dedicated space within 
the Pittsburgh campus where 
students could interact both 
visually and physically with 
students from Doha.
“It is our hope that when 
you walk in the space you will 
feel in some way that you have 
walked onto the Doha campus. 
We hope the furnishings, ? x-
tures, and exhibits re? ect the 
culture, programs, and people 
of CMU-Q. Renee Camerlengo 
and the IMPAQT students will

“Come, come, whoever 
you are, come and join us” is 
the mantra of the Rumi Dia-
logue Club, a student organi-
zation here at Carnegie Mel-
lon that centers itself around 
a message of love, tolerance, 
and respect for life. The club 
bases its values off the works 
and teachings of 13th-century 
poet Jalal ad-D n Muhammad 
Rumi, a devout Muslim and 
Su?  mystic who believed in 
the transformative and unify-
ing powers of love. The Rumi 
Dialogue Club puts these be-
liefs into action by organizing 
workshops and seminars that 
address and resolve cultural 
differences. They also offer 
Turkish language classes in a 
continuing effort to “bridge 
cultural gaps between Carn-
egie Mellon students.”
The club recently had an 
event in the University Cen-
ter on Jan. 12 where anyone 
interested in learning more 
about Rumi and Turkish cul-
ture could come and partici-
pate. UC Connan, where the 
event was held, was packed 
and lively with old and new 
friends chatting and catching 
up. 
True to their message of 
acceptance and tolerance, 
the crowd of attendees was 
diverse in age and ethnicity, 
gathered together through 
the commonality of a thirst 
for learning and a love of 
Turkish food. The majority 
of the event was dedicated to 
distinguished guest professor 
Emine Yeniterzi from Tur-
key’s Rumi Social Research 
Center and professor Nihat 
Polat from Duquesne Uni-
versity’s English as a Second 
Language program.
Yeniterzi spoke at length 
and in great depth about the 
inspiring namesake of the 
club and how the teachings 
of Rumi are still applicable to 
living a meaningful life in the 
modern world. Her speech 
addressed many aspects of 
life on which Rumi gave sage 
advice in the form of poetry, 
some of which included self-
improvement, education and 
spiritual development, time 
management, and struggles 
against adversity. 
Lasting hundreds of years, 
much of his poetry focuses 
on continual transformation 
in an effort to become more 
uni? ed with God and people. 
According to a famous poem 
written by Rumi, “Discard 
the old if you desire new-
ness” (Mathnawi II: 1270). 
The poem typi? es the college 
experience where, especially 
at Carnegie Mellon, transfor-
mation and modernization 
play key roles.
As Yeniterzi pointed out 
throughout her speech, Rumi 
was not really a poet, but an 
educator who used the me-
dium of poetry to convey his 
ideas. He stressed the impor-
tance of critical thinking as a 
way of life, saying, “Reason 
is what enables one to have 
vision to follow on the path 
of transformation and self-
improvement” (Mathnawi I: 
2582). For those who value 
education, espeically stu-
dents, these words are indeed 
potent and pertinent. To use 
Yeniterzi’s analogy, “If the 
world is a body, knowledge is 
what gives it life.”
Yeniterzi’s speech was 
followed by a hauntingly 
beautiful nay, or reed ? ute, 
performancwe by Serkan 
Imisiker, a pro? cient musi-
cian of the ? ute, after which 
Polat gave a speech titled 
“Why Learn Turkish?” Po-
lat’s talk was a lighthearted 
yet sincere argument for 
learning Turkish as a way to 
get an edge on the current 
job market and as an expan-
sion of one’s own worldview. 
After Polat’s speech the 
meeting ended with an ebru, 
or water marbling, perfor-
mance given by Muyesser 
Demir, an artist pro? cient 
in the practice. Some of 
Demir’s work, as well as the 
club’s mission statement and 
upcoming events, can be 
seen online at the Rumi Dia-
logue Club’s Facebook page,

Lecture Preview
The American Association 
for the Advancement of Sci-
ence (AAAS) awarded 2010 
fellowships to three Carnegie 
Mellon University faculty 
members: John Lehoczky, 
Manuela Veloso, and Larry 
Wasserman.
The new AAAS fellows 
will be presented with an of-
? cial certi? cate and a rosette 
pin at the AAAS Fellows Fo-
rum on Feb. 19 during the 
2011 AAAS Annual Meeting 
in Washington, D.C. 
John Lehoczky is the dean 
of the College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences and the 
Thomas Lord Professor of 
Statistics. The AAAS is rec-
ognizing his “signi? cant and 
sustained contributions to 
the theory and applications 
of stochastic processes, par-
ticularly to the modeling of 
real-time computer systems 
and ? nancial markets, and 
for his outstanding contribu-
tions to education both in the 
classroom and through aca-
demic administration.”
Manuela Veloso is being 
recognized for her “distin-
guished contributions to ar-
ti? cial intelligence, especially 
advances in automated plan-
ning, multi-agent systems, 
and robotics.” Veloso is the 
Herbert A. Simon Professor 
of Computer Science.
Larry Wasserman, a 
professor of statistics and 
machine learning, will be 
honored because of his “fun-
damental contributions to 
statistical theory and statis-
tical machine learning, to 
applications of statistics in 
astronomy and genomics and 
to statistical pedagogy.”
Carnegie Mellon profes-
sors Barbara Johnstone and 
Mandy Simons presented on 
Pittsburgh’s unique dialect 
at the Linguistic Society of 
America’s (LSA) 85th Annual 
Meeting. The event was held 
from Jan. 6–9 at the Wynd-
ham Grand Pittsburgh Down-
town hotel. 
Johnstone, a professor of 
English focusing on rheto-
ric, linguistics, and critical 
theory, gave a keynote pre-
sentation on “Speaking Pitts-
burghese: The Social History 
of Pittsburgh Speech.” In her 
lecture, she examined the 
individual characteristics of 
native Pittsburgh speech and 
how, in the second half of 
the 20th century, “Pittsbur-
ghese” has become accepted 
as an authentic dialect. John-
son connected Pittsburgh’s 
unique jargon to the city’s 
local identity and discussed 
why and how this happened 
in Pittsburgh and not in every 
American city.
Simons, an associate pro-
fessor of philosophy who 
launched Carnegie Mellon’s 
linguistics major, presented 
her talk, “Towards a Taxon-
omy of Projective Content.” 
Simons worked with a team 
of collaborators collecting 
research on the topic. She 
shared the results of a Na-
tional Science Foundation-
sponsored research project 
aimed at better understand-
ing different types of linguis-
tically conveyed meaning, 
using data from a variety of 
languages.

Carnegie Mellon’s Greek community hosted a “Greek Meet and Greet” event last Thursday in Rangos Hall to promote participation in campus Greek 
life. Representatives from every fraternity and sorority on campus came together to answers questions about Greek life and talk about the bene? ts of 
going Greek. The event was held as a way of formally introducing Spring Rush 2011 for the Greek community to the rest of campus.
Statistically Speaking
Winter break may be over, but the snow continues 
to fall. During the winter season, Pittsburgh’s weather 
forecasts can be notoriously bleak, often predicting 
snow or rain. Looking back on Pittsburgh’s past temper-
atures and snowfalls reveals how bad the winter season 
can be:
120

37
 average yearly rainfall, in inches
–22°F
the lowest temperature ever 
recorded in Pittsburgh

Education innovations move to increase use of online courses
was taught through online 
modules and homework as-
signments with supplemen-
tary instruction. No textbook 
was required. “The main chal-
lenge with the accelerated 
course was the mental prep-
aration for realizing that it 
was, in fact, accelerated,” said 
Diana Ramos, a junior history 
and psychology major.
With different courses 
come varying challenges. 
No individual student learns 
in exactly the same fashion. 
However, the future of learn-
ing seems to reside in the 
hands of instructional tech-
nologists, groups like Yaron’s 
that work with the OLI to de-
velop online materials. 
Today, a direct link be-
tween Washington educa-
tors and Yaron’s group exists 
through letters of support for 
future grants with statements 
such as, “Your proposed mate-
rials ? t in well with the goals 
of the Open Course Library 
Project and my introductory 
chemistry courses at Bellevue 
College.”
Other universities such as 
the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT), which is 
tied for a No. 1 ranking in com-
puter science, have developed 
over 2,000 free online courses 
that offer lectures, assign-
ments, and quizzes through 
the OpenCourseWare (OCW) 
site at www.ocw.mit.edu. 
MIT is quoted alongside 
Carnegie Mellon in the Chron-
icle of Higher Education’s 
article as providing a “smor-
gasbord” of supplementary 
material. 
However, the two univer-
sities differ in that Carnegie 
Mellon hones in on interac-
tive online modules and pro-
grams like the Virtual Lab. 
The OLI Dashboard also pro-
vides students and instructors 
with real-time feedback about 
progress and learning goals.
The selling point? In the 
article, Cable Green of the 
Washington State Board for 
Community & Technical Col-
leges says students pay $1,000 
a year for books. At Carnegie 
Mellon, students taking an in-
troductory chemistry course 
can expect to pay between 
$88 and $180 for a textbook, 
in addition to $20,750 for a 
semester’s tuition. Further-
more, textbook publishers 
compete with non-pro? t de-
velopers such as WileyPlus, 
which offers online supple-
ments for courses like Differ-
ential Equations for $82.95. 
The article suggests students 
in two-year colleges in Wash-
ington will only pay $30 for 
access to the Open Course Li-
brary, which will provide all 
educational materials.
The future of education 
may reside in discovery, but 
the way in which knowledge 
is conveyed is yet to be deter-
mined. Yaron’s group suggests 
a modern alternative to learn-
ing: hybrid courses (like the 
accelerated statistics course), 
in which students participate 
in traditional lectures but re-
inforce knowledge through 
interactive computer-based 
supplements.
The question remains: 
How long will it take Wash-
ington to implement the Open 
Course Library? The website 
is up, with instructors work-
ing diligently to collaborate 
with institutions like Carnegie 
Mellon. Textbook publishers, 
beware.

is where I feel [King’s] legacy 
really resonates.”
The arts are not the only 
way that Carnegie Mellon 
seeks to engage the campus 
community with King’s mem-

‘The Economic Legacy of Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr.’ will 
be presented by Dr. Julianne

to her website, www.julianne
malveaux.com, she is “recog-
nized for her progressive and 
insightful observations.” 
Laura Hammel, a ? rst-year 
math major, plans to attend, 
“I had never really considered 
the economics of the civil

to be at a school where these 
sorts of opportunities are 
available.” Presenting along-
side her are student speakers 
Maggie Soderholm, a third 
year philosophy and statistics 
double-major, and Appiah 
Adomako, a Heinz graduate 
student. The address will be 
followed by a reception.
Through events such as 
“The Drum Major Instinct: a 
Social Justice Experiment,” 
“Community Conversation: 
Replacing Despair and Hope-
lessness with Hope and Op-
portunity,” and a candlelight 
procession in honor of the 
civil rights movement, partici-
pants have the opportunity to 
consider new ways to pro-
mote civil rights within the 
Pittsburgh community. 
“The Drum Major Instinct: 
a Social Justice Experiment” 
features a lunch and panel 
hosted from 1–3 p.m. in Pe-
ter/Wright/McKenna. The fo-
cus is on motivating commu-
nity members to take action 
through “an interactive expe-
rience that will include an Ox-
fam ‘World Hunger Banquet,’ 
a panel dialogue with local 
young Pittsburgh leaders who 
are creating change in the city 
and an open discussion with 
students about their engage-
ment in social justice issues.” 
Meanwhile, “Commu-
nity Conversation: Replacing 
Despair and Hopelessness 
with Hope and Opportunity” 
also features a panel discus-
sion relating to modern civil 
rights work and racial equal-
ity (2:30–4 p.m., McConomy 
Auditorium).
From 12:30 to 4:30 p.m., 
the Carnegie Mellon Book-

when they are visiting Pitts-
burgh,” said Bryan Koval, the 
housefellow for Resnik.
Mridula Nadamuni, a 
sophomore in biological sci-
ences, had such a chance to 
meet several Qatari students 
on campus during the Odys-
sey Program for sophomores 
the ? rst week of January. 
“I think it’s a great idea 
because it will be one more 
step toward bridging the gap 
between the two campuses. It 
would be wonderful for stu-
dents to have a similar expe-
rience in meeting Qatari stu-
dents on campus,” Nadamuni 
said.
Tarik Raed, an alumnus of 
the IMPAQT program and a 
senior in business administra-
tion, agreed and commented 
that “through dialogue and 
exposure, the Qatar Room 
will help to bridge the gap be-
tween the two campuses and 
allow students to understand 
that the CMU community 
stretches across the globe. The 
room will give students, both 
in Pittsburgh and in Qatar, 
the opportunity to hear about 
each others’ experiences and 
connect in ways that they pre-

Junior Staffwriter
Who doesn’t remember 
their ? rst time going to a 3-D 
movie and being astounded 
by the objects ? ying out of 
the screen? Now, scienti? c 
advancement has found a way 
to bring the same wonder into 
living rooms through the rap-
id advance of 3-D technology. 
The idea of 3-D pictures has 
been around since the inven-
tion of stereo photography in 
1833, where a single picture 
was captured from two slight-
ly different angles and then 
put together in such a way as  
to fool the eye into thinking 
it was looking at a scene with 
depth. 
Technology has obviously 
come a long way since then, 
now utilizing many different 
methods to fool the eye into 
thinking it is looking at a 3-D 
picture. These new 3-D tech-
nologies can broadly be di-
vided into two groups: those 
that need the viewer to wear 
glasses, and those that do not 
require any additional hard-
ware to be used. The more 
popular form of displays are 
ones that do not require glass-
es or ? lters. These are called 
“autostereoscopic” displays. 
They have been around for 
many decades, but are only 
becoming popular now, due to 
the growing production of 3-D 
television sets.
Autostereoscopic displays 
use many techniques to pro-
duce the effect of 3-D vision. 
These displays fool the eye 
into thinking that a 2-D image 
is actually 3-D by making each 
eye see a slightly different im-
age to create the illusion of 
depth. The two main ways to 
do this are called the parallax 
barrier and lenticular lens. In 
the parallax barrier method, a 
barrier is created between the 
display and the eyes. This bar-
rier makes sure that each eye 
receives light from alternating 
pixels on the screen, so that 
each eye can receive a slightly 
different picture. These types 
of televisions can function as 
regular 2-D displays, as the 
parallax barrier can simply be 
disabled by having a current 
passed through it to display 
the pictures normally. In the 
lenticular lens method, small 
lenses are attached to the 
screen, and these direct the 
light from the television into a 
de? ned optimal viewing area 
where the eyes can look to see 
a 3-D image. Obviously, both 
of these methods depend upon 
the eyes being in a pre-de? ned 
area if the viewer wishes to see 
a 3-D image. However, real 
viewers do not always sit in 
the same place to watch tele-
vision. This dif? culty has been 
eliminated by the television 
manufacturers by including 
head or eye-tracking software 
with their televisions.
Another way manufactur-
ers have been able to make au-
tostereoscopic displays more 
technologically advanced is 
by removing the need for head 
tracking software completely, 
even though this method re-
quires more computing power 
to be present in the television. 
This extra computing power 
is then used to project light to 
several different viewpoints 
at the same time, allowing 
the eye to move around in the 
viewing area and not lose the 
3-D picture. This method can 
accommodate a large number 
of different viewing angles. 
However, this process is ac-
companied by a loss in resolu-
tion.
3-D televisions are already 
gaining popularity among sev-
eral television manufacturers 
who plan to make 3-D televi-
sions cheaper and more acces-
sible for the public. Many tele-
vision shows have also started 
providing 3-D versions; one of 
the more notable 3-D televi-
sion broadcasts was the 2010 
FIFA World Cup. Although 3-D 
technology is not just limited 
to TVs — gadgets such as the 
Nintendo 3DS and 3-D laptops 
have been developed — their 
rapid technological advance-
ment is spurred by high de-
mand and a wave of 3-D mov-
ies in theaters. Now people 
have the choice to be able to 
experience the magic of seeing 
a 3-D movie in the comfort of 
their own home.

claimed to link the common 
vaccine for measles, mumps, 
and rubella (MMR) to autism

Wake? eld’s ? ndings have been 
criticized, and the scienti? c

The Lancet itself denounced 
Wake? eld’s study as a fraud. 
A report by journalist Brian

liver damage. Damage is more 
likely when the ingredient 
is combined with alcohol or

Earth’s orbit causes change in zodiac
A physical phenomenon 
known as precession has 
forced astrologers to add a new 
sign to the zodiac. Precession 
is a consequence of the moon’s 
gravity affecting the Earth’s 
orbit, in which the Earth’s axis 
“wobbles” over time. A com-
plete rotation of the axis takes 
26,000 years. This means that 
views of the night sky change, 
which means that zodiac signs 
change as well. The new sign 
is called Ophiuchus.

Study evaluates the impacts of different hybrid-electric vehicles
DANIEL TKACIK
Staffwriter
With the introduction of 
vehicles such as the Chevrolet 
Volt, Nissan Leaf, and Toyota 
Prius, you now have a handful 
of choices of hybrid-electric 
vehicles. If the motivation for 
these vehicles is reducing our 
dependence on oil, how do 
they compare to one another? 
What about reducing green-
house gas emissions? And on 
top of all of this, are the costs 
worth the bene? ts? Given the 
potentially harmful environ-
mental impacts of continuing 
an oil- and gasoline-based au-
tomobile industry, a professor 
at Carnegie Mellon has been 
working to answer these ques-
tions.
Jeremy Michalek, a profes-
sor in the departments of engi-
neering and public policy and 
mechanical engineering, has 
been working with colleagues 
to study the various effects 
of driving hybrid electric ve-
hicles (HEVs) and plug-in hy-
brid electric vehicles (PHEVs) 
on the environment. They 
are interested in the bene? ts 
as well as the disadvantages, 
which may vary depending on 
numerous factors such as bat-
tery type, distance driven, and 
where the electricity used to 
charge the car battery comes 
from.
Something that the aver-
age consumer may not think 
about is that the emissions 
associated with driving these 
electric vehicles include more 
than what comes out of the 
tailpipe. Emissions are re-
leased  many times during the 
life cycle of an electric vehicle: 
from smokestacks of factories 
that make the vehicles, as well 
as the power plants that make 
the electricity to charge the ve-
hicle. Michalek explains that 
switching from a gasoline to 
a plug-in vehicle changes the 
types of emissions and where 
they are released.
“The nice thing about elec-
tricity is that you can make it 
in lots of different ways and in 
different locations. Gasoline 
comes from oil. Sure, you can 
make it synthetically, but it 
basically comes from oil. Elec-
tricity can be made in so many 
different ways, including 
renewable ways,” Michalek 
said.
Through the use of op-
timization models, he and 
his research group looked at 
which combination of battery 
properties — like type, ca-
pacity, and operating method 
— resulted in the best bal-
ance between greenhouse 
gas emissions and cost. They 
compared vehicles that were 
essentially identical in every 
way except for the power-
train options; thus, any effects 
that resulted from a change 
in battery properties could 
be assigned to that particular 
change.
The results of this study, 
which were recently published 
in the Journal of Mechanical 
Design, found that the size of 
the battery pack played an 
important role in greenhouse 
gas emissions and cost. Larg-
er battery packs allow more 
miles to be driven on electric-
ity, but those additional miles 
do not outweigh the amount 
of greenhouse gas emissions 
associated with the produc-
tion of those batteries. Smaller 
battery packs, however, allow 
fewer miles to be driven on 
electricity, but are signi? cant-
ly cheaper, so there is a larger 
reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions per dollar spent on 
the battery. Therefore, con-
sidering both economics and 
greenhouse gas emissions, a 
moderate- to small-sized bat-
tery pack was found to be op-
timal.
In an interview with the 
website Electric Vehicle World, 
Michalek explained, “It will be 
a good transition for people to 
start buying these HEVs and 
PHEVs with smaller battery 
packs because batteries will 
start being produced more 
frequently, and we can move 
quicker down the battery 
learning curve and hopefully 
make them cheaper.” As the 
technology on battery produc-
tion improves, larger battery 
packs would therefore become 
more economical and have an 
even larger impact on green-
house gas emissions.
Michalek has 
presented pol-
icy briefs to 
Congress members in Wash-
ington to make sure that peo-
ple who are involved with en-
ergy policymaking are aware 
of the ? ndings. Spreading this 
knowledge to make policymak-
ers and the public more aware 
of the available technology is 
important in moving society 
toward a more sustainable 
way of living. The next step, 
Michalek said, will be in esti-
mating the value of the ben-
e? ts of electric vehicles. Quan-
tifying all of the bene? ts will 
help us determine as a society 
whether or not it is worth the 
switch to a more electricity-
based automobile market.

As the snowy weather 
shows no signs of letting up, 
students are constantly re-
minded of one aspect of winter 
— it’s very cold outside. And 
even when proper measures 
are taken to stay warm, such 
as bundling up and hurrying 
to class, cold weather poses a 
health risk to those who are 
forced to stay outside for long 
periods of time.
Many people believe the 
human body is always at 
a constant 98.6°F, but the 
body’s internal temperature 
normally ? uctuates between 
98°F and 100°F. Various pro-
cesses in the body regulate the 
internal temperature, but the 
body cannot compensate for 
extremely cold temperatures. 
If the body’s internal tempera-
ture drops below 95°F, this 
becomes a medical emergency 
known as hypothermia, ac-
cording to Mayo Clinic.
The part of the brain that 
regulates body temperature is 
the hypothalamus, which both 
obtains temperature data from 
the body and sends instruc-
tions back, as stated in an arti-
cle on www.medicinenet.com. 
For example, when we are 
feeling cold, the hypothalamus 
recognizes that body tempera-
ture must be increased. Thus, 
it may respond by telling our 
muscles to shiver.
Most of the body’s heat is 
lost through the skin. There-
fore, as the body’s tempera-
ture decreases, blood is rout-
ed through vessels that are 
further from the skin, which 
prevents rapid heat loss. In ad-
dition, the more vital organs, 
such as the heart, lungs, and 
brain, receive greater amounts 
of blood, while limbs and ex-
tremities receive less. When 
the body’s core temperature 
decreases enough, blood ? ow, 
and therefore oxygen delivery, 
may be so limited to certain 
organs that they begin to fail.
Hypothermia is dangerous 
not only because of its effects 
on the body, but also on the 
mind. As blood ? ow becomes 
restricted, the brain’s reason-
ing ability decreases. Since the 
onset of hypothermia is gradu-
al, a hypothermic person may 
not even realize he or she is 
in danger. Other symptoms of 
hypothermia include hunger, 
nausea, confusion, lethargy, 
and slurred speech, according 
to www.medicinenet.com. If 
a person’s body temperature 
drops too low, he or she may 
lose consciousness and fall 
into a coma. In addition, low 
temperatures cause the heart 
to beat abnormally, resulting 
in cardiac arrest.
Treatment for hypothermia 
involves moving the victim to 
a warm place and covering 
him or her. The body should 
be gradually heated. In many 
cases, frostbite occurs along 
with hypothermia, so heat 
should not directly be applied 
to the body.
Everybody gets cold, but 
certain people are more sus-
ceptible to heat loss than oth-
ers. Children and the elderly 
cannot generate heat ef? cient-
ly, and infants, who have pro-
portionally large heads, lose 
heat quickly. Alcohol seems 
to make the body warmer, but 
the opposite is true; alcohol 
causes blood vessels to dilate, 
which forces blood nearer to 
the surface of the skin. In ad-
dition, alcohol diminishes the 
amount the body shivers. As 
a result, body heat is lost at a 
faster rate.
While hypothermia is a 
medical emergency, it has its 
use in medical procedures. 
One of these procedures is 
called therapeutic hypotherm-
ia, which is usually performed 
on patients who have suffered 
from a heart attack. If the body 
is cooled to a temperature 
around 93.2°F after it has suf-
fered from a heart attack, sur-
vival rates have been shown 
to increase, and the patients 
show a greater amount of re-
covery.
Hypothermia is dangerous, 
but can easily be prevented 
by using common sense and 
avoiding harsh weather.

Words unique to geographical regions
Using a sample of 15 percent of public tweets during a one-week span 
last March, researchers were able to isolate certain slang words 
exclusive to urban areas. 
COURTNEY CHIN
SciTech Editor
When one thinks of dia-
lects of a language, one usu-
ally thinks of spoken varia-
tions that evolve from factors 
such as geographic location 
or social class. However, Twit-
ter has provided two Carnegie 
Mellon researchers and their 
advising professors with the 
opportunity to study distinct 
dialects evolving from the 
140-character updates of fre-
quent Twitter users. 
Since Twitter is a conver-
sational social medium, users 
are more likely to spell words 
as they are pronounced, thus 
giving Jacob Eisenstein and 
Brendan O’Connor, a post-
doctoral fellow and doctorate 
student in the Machine Learn-
ing Department, respectively, 
the chance to study this phe-
nomenon. Two other co-au-
thors on their paper are Eric P. 
Xing, an associate professor of 
machine learning, and Noah 
A. Smith, assistant professor 
at the Language Technologies 
Institute.
Eisenstein and O’Connor 
provided background on the 
project and its objectives. 
“[This could tell us] what 
language variations mean, 
and if this is a random phe-
nomena that rises and peters 
out — or is there some con-
scious or subconscious desire 
that people have to distinguish 
their communities by the way 
to speak, and is that inher-
ent to language?” Eisenstein 
said.
Over the course of a week 
last March, Eisenstein and 
O’Connor gathered tweets 
from 9,500 users who updated 
at least 40 times a day and 
had no more than 1,000 users 
and followers. With a base of 
380,000 total tweets (or ap-
proximately 15 parents of pub-
lic tweets) the two then sepa-
rated out messages with URLs, 
as they could be a source of 
spam, and tweets not in the 
contiguous United States.
After gathering data for a 
week and sorting the data ac-
cording to geographical and 
subject markers, the team 
was able to create a rough 
breakdown of words unique 
to urban centers of the United 
States, such as New York City, 
Northern California, Atlanta, 
and New England. For in-
stance, New York users often 
tweeted “suttin” instead of 
“something” whereas tweets 
containing the words “hella” 
and “koo” often originated in 
Northern California.
In order to sift through the 
tweets, the pair used math-
ematical models and statisti-
cal distributions to unveil the 
regional dialects. One model 
they considered was change 
over time. For instance, does 
the dialect start in urban cen-
ters and expand outward, or 
does it move from city to city? 
Change over time comes from 
the upper-working class and 
moves up, Eisenstein said, and 
could provide an entry point 
for changes in language. While 
children learn how to write 
from school, they learn how to 
speak from their parents.
“When you look at Twit-
ter as a whole, it’s a lot more 
diverse with respect to age,” 
Eisenstein said. “It’s not a 
bunch of teenagers, but when 
you [? rst] post from cell 
phones and [second] post a 
billion messages, that may be 
what gives us a bias to have 
sort of younger people in our 
data.”
O’Connor added, “Because 
Twitter is a very informal form 
of writing, it’s better at get-
ting these changes in casual 
language than other forms of 
writing, because you can spell 
things how you speak, and 
no one tells [you] how to use 
Twitter. You can use things like 
vowel changes or small stuff 
that don’t make it into formal 
writing that can quite conceiv-
ably appear in Twitter.”
Besides accounting for 
high-usage words, the team 
also had to consider which 
parts of their data were rel-
evant to a sustained change 
over time. 
In reference to an acro-
nym found on the East Coast, 
Eisenstein explained, “Here is 
a word that only occurs in New 
York or only in Pennsylvania, 
and you have to ask yourself, 
is this a stable variation...? 
When we look at this a year 
from now, is it still going to be 
the case that we only see it in 
this part of the country, or will 
is spread to the whole country, 
or will it completely disappear 
off the map?”
Eisenstein also accounted 
for random variables that do 
not relate to a region’s dialect. 
In one instance, the Oklahoma 
Thunder played two games 
against the Sacramento Kings, 
which accounted for why 
“thunder” was a dialect mark-
er for the Northern California 
region. 
“If you did a more longitu-

Another marker that was ex-
clusive to the Lake Erie region 
was “Bieber.” Whether this is 
an anomaly or not is yet to be 
determined.
Change on Twitter happens 
a lot faster than in other me-

ers to study changes in real 
time. While studies about lan-
guage changes on Twitter are 
still early, such ? ndings could 
provide further insight into 
linguistics and the evolution 
of culture.

County Port Authority made sensible ? scal decision
In December, the Port Author-
ity of Allegheny County received 
millions of dollars in supplemental 
funding. In January, it announced a 
15 percent service cut. It sounds con-
tradictory, but represents the best ? -
nancial planning we have seen from 
the authority in recent years.
The Port Authority has been re-
quiring regular bailouts since long 
before the term made its appearance 
in the national conversation. Penn-
sylvania Gov. Ed Rendell repeatedly 
sent emergency funding to the Port 
Authority to help it survive 2004, 
2005, and 2006. In 2007, the Allegh-
eny County Council passed the infa-
mous alcoholic beverage tax for the 
transit agency’s bene? t. And the gov-
ernor came to the rescue again last 
year with another $45 million.
Last year’s emergency money 
would have been enough to keep the 
Port Authority funded at current ser-
vice levels until June, but then the 
cycle of begging and bailouts would 
only have begun again — this time 
with incoming Gov. Tom Corbett and 
a new state legislature barely settled 
into their of? ces in Harrisburg. Fur-
thermore, with the state government 
facing its own $4 billion projected 
budget de? cit, it is unlikely that 
anyone in Harrisburg would be able 
to address the Port Authority crisis 
in a reasonable manner this year. 
Without help, the authority would 
be forced to cut bus service by more 
than a third.
Faced with that uninviting pic-
ture, the Port Authority instead made 
the sound decision to stretch out 
Rendell’s current $45 million for an 
extra year by announcing a smaller 
round of service cuts for March. This 
gives both the county and the state 
government until July 2012 to devise 
a long-term solution to the Port Au-
thority’s consistent woes.
If anything is clear, it is that the 
transit authority, county, and state 
must ? nd a long-term solution. 
While any transit cuts now are cer-
tainly frustrating, the Port Authority 
cannot inde? nitely maintain a miser-
able existence by subsisting on year-
to-year emergency bailouts. Though 
we may grumble when our 71A takes 
longer to arrive or when the 28X 
goes through Robinson again come 
March, we should accept the incon-
venience if it means our buses will 
continue to come at all.
LETTER TO THE EDITORHunt Foundation funded library lighting changes
Thank you for your continued 
coverage of the Hunt Library light-
ing project. We are writing to point 
out a serious factual error in the 
story published on Nov. 22, 2010 
(“Hunt Library interior lighting to 
be addressed following exterior re-
design”). That is, Bill Hunt did NOT 
pay for the exterior lighting.
As written, the third paragraph 
states, “The lights are a gift from 
Roy Hunt’s grandson, Bill Hunt, 
who pointed out that the building 
was only visible half the time.”
A way to incorporate the neces-
sary correction would be to end the 
second paragraph with this sen-
tence: “The lights were paid for by 
a grant from the Roy A. Hunt Foun-
dation.”
And to edit the third paragraph 
as follows: “The story began when 
Roy Hunt’s grandson, Bill Hunt, 
pointed out that the view across 
campus would be enhanced if all the 
lights in Hunt Library were turned 
on. ‘Like many campus buildings, 
the library disappears structurally 
at night. All you are seeing are the 
? uorescent lights inside, and then 
you’re seeing half the building dark,’ 
Popowich said.”
We ask that you
1. Correct the error in the online 
story immediately, and note that the 
article has been corrected
2. Print a correction in the next 
publication of The Tartan
3. Publish the content of this 
message as a Letter to the Editor in 
the same issue as the correction is 
printed.
Again, we appreciate your re-
porting on developments in Hunt 
Library, and there are more good 
stories to be told. We are actively 
working with students and continu-
ally upgrading University Libraries 
facilities in response to student re-
quests, as projects are prioritized by 
our SAC and Help Hunt folks, and as 
funding is available. Next semester, 
we would like to meet and talk with 
you about the latest news, plans, 
and projects on the immediate ho-
rizon.

COMMUNITY OPINIONSWinter can be a time of joy in spite of weather
SAMAYA SINHA 
The long winter days can be tire-
some — trudging through the snow 
with a runny nose, chapped lips, 
hands stuffed in pockets, and wind 
piercing through jackets and sweat-
ers. The sky, always a dull gray or 
pearly white sheet, mirrors the lay-
ers of powdery snow below. There 
is not even one glimpse of the sun. 
The winter months are particularly 
trying, almost depressing.
Yet there is also something en-
chanting about the winter, despite 
its harshness. There is that excite-
ment in the air when awaiting the 
? rst snowfall of the season — a 
lingering expectation. There is that 
sense of pure joy upon catching a 
snow? ake on a gloved hand and 
watching its unique pattern wilt 
into the fabric. There is that feeling 
of warmth upon drinking a cup of 
coffee while struggling through the 
snow and the wind, clasping the hot 
cup in frozen hands. This is when 
winter is beautiful.
It is the beauty of winter that 
helps with overcoming its very 
harshness. It is the time to recall 
snowball ? ghts and sledding and 
snow angels. It is the time for folly 
rather than seriousness — a brief, 
secondary childhood. It is the 
time to remember the sensation of 
molding ? uffy snow into tiny balls, 
poised to throw them at others in 
merriment. It is the time to recollect 
the feeling of slipping and sliding 
through the soft, moist snow on a 
sled or on a tray or with a trash bag, 
with the air whooshing past with 
great fury. It is a time of creativity, 
shaping snowmen from powder and 
using peppers, carrots, and olives 
for its smiling face.
However, why is it so hard to 
throw off the mask of propriety, of 
seriousness, of adulthood, in favor 
of becoming a child once more? 
There is that lack of spontaneity and 
wonder as reality creeps through 
childhood dreams and fantasies — 
the reality of responsibility. It is for 
this reason that this is the season to 
rediscover those youthful notions, 
to become nostalgic for those enjoy-
ments and amusements.
Memory has that strange way of 
dulling the unpleasant while em-
phasizing the pleasures of the past. 
It is for this reason that it is so im-
portant to live within the present, 
to embrace all the possibilities of 
a winter day, despite its seeming 
dreariness. A winter day — a time 
for a good book and a cup of tea, a 
hike, a meeting with friends, discov-
ering new places, ? nding new ideas, 
meeting new people, searching for 
all the small, amazing things about 
an ordinary, mundane day. It is 
those tiny things that make each day 
unique — a smile, a thought, a hug, 
a look, a glimpse, a glance, a group, 
a friendship, a sudden recollection, 
the dawning of a new idea, seeing 
something in a new light for the ? rst 
time. This is when an ordinary, hard 
winter day transforms into a gem, 
something to embrace and look for-
ward to — an opportunity.

Sudan referendum could signal end to long con? ict
During the past week, the country 
of Sudan voted on whether the south-
ern region of the country should se-
cede from the north. This referendum 
on southern independence was one of 
the requirements of the 2005 peace 
agreement that brought an end to a 
two-decade civil war. We hope that 
last week’s referendum will bring to 
a ? nal close what has been a long and 
bloody con? ict. Indeed, the vote was 
conducted without the violence that 
has often plagued Sudan and other 
divided countries in the past. 
Sudan was originally pieced to-
gether during the European coloni-
zation of Africa, where ethnic bound-
aries were completely disregarded.  
Most northern Sudanese are Muslim, 
whereas southerners tend to embrace 
Christianity and animist religions. 
The differences between the two 
have led to much con? ict, resulting in 
50 years of near-constant turmoil.
In addition, many argue that 
northern Sudan is taking advantage 
of the abundant natural resources in 
the south while reciprocating with 
very little in terms of development, 
infrastructure, education, and health 
care. The inequality begs for a better 
solution; we believe this solution is 
separation.
Consistent with general expecta-
tions, the initial returns from voting 
are in favor of secession. The only 
impediment to the success of the in-
dependence movement seemed to 
be that it required at least 60 percent 
of the registered voters to take part. 
Initial estimates have indicated that 
an overwhelming majority of south-
ern Sudanese voters participated in 
the election, and we are thrilled by 
this expression of popular support, as 
well as the peaceful way in which the 
elections were conducted.
Should independence be, as ex-
pected, the of? cial outcome of the 
referendum, we expect to see a new 
country this summer. Some leaders 
such as Sudanese President Omar 
al-Bashir suggest that the separa-
tion will result in instability and slow 
progress toward development. 
We acknowledge that a transition 
to independence will be dif? cult for 
the southern Sudanese people to ac-
complish: Even though the majority 
of the natural resources in Sudan are 
located in the south, the region has 
not seen as much development in 
sanitation or education as the rest of 
the country, and its approximately 8 
million citizens have a very low stan-
dard of living with minimal health 
care. However, the separation of the 
two halves of the country is the best 
option given their history of con? ict.
Politicians, media should follow Giffords’ example
In the nine days since the horri? c 
shooting in Tucson, Ariz., Ameri-
cans have tried to make sense of the 
tragedy. Journalists, politicians, and 
others have debated possible causes, 
trying to ? nd sense in a senseless vi-
olent act. There are, no doubt, many 
lessons to be learned from that fate-
ful Saturday. However, many public 
of? cials and media personalities 
have already tarnished the memo-
ries of the victims by spouting their 
own agendas.
Authorities’ investigations into 
the background of Jared Loughner 
— who allegedly shot Rep. Gabrielle 
Giffords (D–Ariz.), killed six people, 
and wounded 13 more — are enough 
to convince any observer that this 
attack was not the result of twisted 
political messages or campaign com-
mercials taken too literally. It was, 
in the truest sense of the word, the 
work of a madman. Sarah Palin, 
whose commercial drew crosshairs 
over Giffords’ district, and Shar-
ron Angle, who advocated “Second 
Amendment remedies” in the event 
of her election loss, cannot be held 
accountable for Loughner’s actions. 
There have been and will be acts 
of politically motivated violence 
caused by these words and those of 
other demagogues like Glenn Beck 
and Keith Olbermann. Tucson was 
not among them.
Instead of linking their pleas for 
political moderation to Loughner, 
public ? gures should instead use Gif-
fords herself as an inspiration. She is 
a Democrat in a conservative district, 
and she has consistently put service 
over politics. If Giffords makes a sig-
ni? cant recovery, which we sincerely 
hope she does, we do not expect her 
to blame some other politician or 
pundit for the tragedy. We expect 
her to continue, as she has always 
done, to serve her constituents and 
the United States to the best of her 
ability, without regard for media at-
tention or front-page headlines. It 
is an example that others would do 
well to follow.

A PERSON’S OPINION
January 17, 2011 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
Compiled by Jonathan Carreon
The Tartan is trudging to classes through the snow this week. So we asked,
What is your favorite snow-related activity?
LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVESTartan additions to help serve readers
Welcome back, Tartan readers 
new and old.
Some of you may know that 
The Tartan’s leadership changes 
every calendar year, and, as the 
new editor-in-chief, I wanted to 
use this space to give you a pre-
view of some of the new and excit-
ing changes we have planned for 
2011. I am not writing this simply 
to tell, though. I am writing be-
cause I want you, the students, 
faculty, staff, administration, and 
alumni of Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, to respond.
The biggest and most obvious 
change in the coming months will 
be to The Tartan Online. We have 
spent the last several months re-
designing thetartan.org from the 
ground up to be more useful to 
you, our readers. 
Not only has the visual design 
been completely changed, but the 
new site will be more navigable, 
and it will re? ect that the mem-
bers of our staff are your friends 
and colleagues. 
You will be able to ? nd all the 
columns by the TA for your physics 
course and all the photos from that 
guy you sit next to in economics. 
It will be easier to ? nd informa-
tion, and, just as importantly, it 
will be easier to interact with our 
staff and the rest of the university 
community. We expect to launch 
the new site within the coming 
months.
The new website is not the only 
addition coming to The Tartan. 
You can expect to see more pro-
? les of faculty and their cutting-
edge research. You can expect to 
see coverage of intramural and 
club sports. At the same time, we 
will continue to provide news and 
opinion relevant to our readership. 
This content will still be available 
in our weekly print edition, but it 
will also be accessible through in-
stant updates to our website and 
social media connections on Face-
book and Twitter.
Throughout our efforts this 
year, the goal is to be relevant to 
our readers — those of you who 
are reading this column now, and 
those who will join us in the next 
12 months. 
I hope that you are as excited 
about these plans as I am, but I 
want your feedback. To that end, 
The Tartan has for the ? rst time 
in several years appointed an om-
budsman, Patrick Gage Kelley, to 
represent the concerns of the uni-
versity community. He is charged 
not only with seeking your opin-
ions but with making sure that they 
are heard. You can contact him at 
ombudsman@thetartan.org. 
I, and the rest of the editorial 
staff, look forward to serving you 
over the next year.

West’s new ‘Monster’ full of murder and misogyny
College ACB leaves users vulnerable to libel
KATIE CHIRONIS
It began with JuicyCampus. 
Suddenly, the idea of an anonymous 
Internet forum didn’t seem so strange, 
with a simple modus operandi: Give 
college students a place to talk 
about anything (or anyone) without 
fear of repercussions. Then in 2009 
JuicyCampus closed, and College 
ACB moved into the void left behind. 
It’s been steadily growing in use ever 
since, with an explosion of activity 
on Carnegie Mellon’s board over the 
past three months.
The concept, on the surface, is 
surprisingly liberating. Students can 
post topics complaining about a fel-
low student, an organization, a class, 
or an RA — all without fear of being 
held accountable for their comments. 
Fraternities and sororities are also 
at the center of many discussions. 
However, College ACB’s problems 
are immediately visible with only a 
brief glance. An average post from 
the Carnegie Mellon board is slightly 
ridiculous, sometimes amusing — 
and sometimes outright defamatory. 
Topics such as “Frats that haze vs 
frats that dont [sic]” and “are there 
any hot Indians at Carnegie” are the 
trending fodder, to name a few. It’s a 
site that runs somewhere in between 
the humble pensiveness of Montaigne 
and the collective trash of a service 
like 4chan.
The problem for users of College 
ACB lies in one word: libel. Com-
ments printed about an individual 
that are untrue and are defamatory 
can be pursued by that person in a 
court of law — and the site can be 
served a subpoena for a poster’s per-
sonal information. 
College ACB does offer an inter-
nal moderation service, but its ef-
fectiveness is questionable. “Any post 
that might be threatening, libelous, 
or otherwise illegal is immediately 
brought to the webmaster’s atten-
tion,” wrote Peter Frank, the site’s op-
erator, in the site’s ? rst press release. 
However, the noti? cation function 
often takes days to carry through, 
and it can often only nominate sev-
eral posts for deletion at a time. The 
person reporting the posts must also 
be the one defamed by them; simply 
reporting libelous posts won’t work. 
Despite this system, there is a very 
real possibility that legal action may 
be taken. The Communications De-
cency Act protects the owners of the 
site themselves from directly being 
sued; however, if they wish to avoid 
being complicit in a John Doe lawsuit, 
they’ll be asked to provide the offend-
ing poster’s personal information (in-
cluding the poster’s IP address). 
Posting from the comparative 
anonymity of a public station such 
as a cluster is no safe haven, either. If 
asked to produce personal informa-
tion for legal purposes, “Computing 
Services would be able to identify 
the account or accounts being used 
on the machine at a given time,” said 
John Lerchey, a representative of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Information Se-
curity Of? ce. “On machines like the 
UNIX servers where multiple users 
access the machine remotely simul-
taneously, we would likely be able to 
provide a list of users that were on the 
system at the time.” The moral of the 
story? No place on campus — or on 
a personal computer, for that matter 
— is entirely anonymous. The price 
of an insult to a member of the cam-
pus community could be thousands 
of dollars in attorney fees at the very 
least, and ? nes at the very worst. In 
the interests of self-preservation, if 
nothing else, the potential cost seems 
intimidatingly large.
The important question here is 
simple. Despite all the negative press, 
is this service worth keeping? Is free 
speech meant to harm another a tool 
worth protecting or something worth 
inhibiting? That’s the debate that this 
campus’s participating community 
ultimately needs to have with itself. If 
there is one thing we must rejoice in, 
it is that the Internet is such a venue 
of freedom that sites such as this one 
are available unhindered. Some col-
lege campuses have called for bans of 
College ACB on their networks; oth-
ers such as Cornell University have 
seen students moving to boycott the 
site. Even if the site were to be cen-
sored or banned at Carnegie Mellon, 
would that be enough, and would 
anything really change? 
It may simply be that, given the 
availability — or at least the appear-
ance — of anonymity, human nature 
calls for us to exploit it to the fullest. 
Yet it is in each individual’s best self-
interest to determine whether the 
price his or her words might carry are 
worth more than the alternative: a 
more powerful statement of silence.

A clip of Kanye West’s newest 
music video, “Monster,” was leaked 
this week, quickly attracting the at-
tention of the public and the out-
rage of many of the nation’s women. 
Why? 
I’m a muthaf***ing monster.
The short, 30-second clip from 
the full-length video features, among 
other images: bikini-clad, high-
heeled women hung from the ceiling 
by the neck with chains; two dead 
women in bed with one man, their 
eyes glazed over as he positions their 
lifeless arms around each other; a 
woman drenched in blood, crouch-
ing over a dead man, eating his guts 
with her bare hands; and Kanye West 
casually holding the blood-dripping, 
disembodied head of another wom-
an.
Women hang from nooses, lie in 
twisted heaps, and are maneuvered, 
mutilated, and subjected to other 
morbid sexual shenanigans — it only 
takes about ? ve seconds of the video 
to sense a theme. And I, for one, am 
certainly not exactly on the edge of 
my seat waiting to see how the short 
clip ends in the ? nal video. 
I crossed the line.
Arguments have been made that 
this is West’s attempt to cross the 
line, and I get that. The video is pri-
marily about shock value, an attempt 
to enter back into the spotlight, re-
charge the debate that often follows 
him — whether it is sparked by call-
ing former President George W. Bush 
racist, interrupting Taylor Swift’s 
award reception, or, now, a video 
that highlights dead, drugged, or de-
capitated women.
Others have supported the video, 
claiming that it also plays into a his-
tory of a genre of this type of exag-
gerated horror that has existed since 
Romantic literature. It can even be 
argued that, like much that falls into 
the category of Gothic horror, there 
is a sense of satire about the grue-
some scenes displayed.
I smell a massacre.
While these arguments can be 
made, it is hard to move past the 
fact that West did not choose just 
to involve corpses; he chose female 
corpses, which were then sexualized, 
as well as being drugged, beaten, 
decapitated, killed, and even eaten. 
This is gendered violence at an ex-
treme level.
The Coalition Against Traf? ck-
ing in Women (Australia), Collective 
Shout: for a world free of sexploita-
tion, and Adios Barbie sponsored 
a petition against the release of 
the video. The petition states that 
the “music industry’s portrayals of 
women’s pain, suffering, abuse, ob-
jecti? cation, and victimization as 
valid forms of entertainment are not 
acceptable,” and demands that “Uni-
versal Music Group and MTV combat 
violence against women by refusing 
to support, promote, and/or give air-
time to West’s ‘Monster’ video.” 
I signed the petition, and I did so 
because of much more than my gen-
eral frustration with the violence, 
nudity, and over-sexualized imagery 
that has become the norm in much of 
the modern music industry. Yes, the 
video is incredibly violent; yes, the 
women are undressed and featured 
as sex objects; and yes, the lyrics seem 
to repeat the continual references to 
bitches and hos, and of course in-
clude the obligatory references to 
male power and domination.
This video, however, crosses a 
line. It not only glori? es women’s 
bodies — it glori? es women as ob-
jects deserving of pain and suffering, 
deserving of silence, deserving of 
force and violence.
As one of the best commentar-
ies on the video, written by Melinda 
Tankard Reist, read:
“Expect to hear boys singing along 
to it soon. This is the message they 
are imbibing:
‘Women are slaves and bitches 
who can service a man’s sexual 
needs, even in death. Men are bru-
tal and dominant, and have no em-
pathy for women. Men enjoy dead 
women as sex and entertainment. 
The female body is to be devoured, 
reduced to the same status as meat. 
Female bodies should be displayed 
before men as a great feast for their 
consumption.’ ”
Everybody know I’m a 
muthaf***ing monster.

out a ? eld goal.  
After two free throws by 
junior Joe Kromka, the Judg-
es made a run, outlasting the 
Tartans over the next six min-
utes, 12–4, tying the game at 
50 with less than a minute re-
maining.  
In the waning moments 
of the game, junior John 
Duhring assisted senior Shane 
Rife in transition to give the 
Tartans the lead.
That lead was quickly 
eliminated by the Judges’ 
Tyrone Hughes, who hit two 
free throws to tie the game at 
52 with just 33.6 seconds re-
maining.
On the Tartans’ ? nal pos-
session, Manoli was fouled 
and converted just one of two 
free throws.  He would make 
up for the miss with a clutch 
defensive play.
With the score now 53–52 
Tartans, the Judges held the 
ball for the ? nal possession. 
Ben Bartoldus of the Judges 
curled to the elbow for the 
potential game-winning shot 
with less than three sec-
onds in the game, and Man-
oli stepped up to block the 
shot, ending the game and 
securing the victory for the 
Tartans.
Defense was the key in this 
victory, as it took every ounce 
of hustle on the defensive side 
of the ball to upset the No. 13 
Brandeis Judges. The Tartans 
out-rebounded the Judges, 
39–36, and a clutch defen-
sive play by Manoli ensured a 
Tartan victory in the ? nal mo-
ments of the game.
“Our effort on the de-
fensive end was the difference 
for us in a big game like this,” 
? rst-year Sean Brophy said.
The superb perimeter 
shooting and balanced of-
fensive attack also furnished 
the victory, as Manoli, Rife, 
and ? rst-year Rashaun Riley 
all led the Tartans in scoring 
with 10 points each.
The Tartans also hosted 
New York University yester-
day at noon.
cably barely made a peep in 
trying to sign Crawford and 
Adrian Beltre, both of whom 
would have ? lled giant holes 
in their lineup and put the 
team on the right track after a 
horrendous 2010 campaign. 
The Marlins have traded away 
most of their former future, 
most notably sending Dan 
Uggla to fellow NL East-mate 
Atlanta.
But then there are the 
teams that couldn’t help hav-
ing a bad off-season in 2010. 
The Royals traded Zack Grein-
ke because he asked them to. 
The Padres traded Gonzalez 
because they couldn’t afford 
to pay him what he deserved. 
The Rays lost Crawford to the 
Sox and Carlos Pena to the 
Cubs via free agency simply 
because they couldn’t afford 
to re-sign either, and they 
later traded Matt Garza to the 
Cubs to avoid having to pay 
him more than they would be 
able to. 
The Rays have signi? cantly 
less money to work with than 
most teams, especially due to 
the unfortunate fact that no 
one in Tampa seems to come 
to their games. The Mets have 
made big management and 
front of? ce shakeups, but their 
off-season plan seems hinged 
around maybes, has-beens, 
and hopefuls. Their off-sea-
son situation has a little more 
backstory than “can’t help 
it,” though; they have almost 
zero payroll ? exibility, mainly 
due to bad deals of off-sea-
sons past. 2011 benchwarmer 
Luis Castillo is owed $6 mil-
lion this year, and bullpen 
forget-me-please Oliver Perez 
is owed $12 million. Carlos 
Beltran is in the ? nal season 
of his expensive contract, 
but if things go according to 
plan, he could still make this 
year worth every penny. That 
said, with what little money 
they do have, the Mets have 
made some potentially good 
moves and some nonsensical 
ones, the most prominent be-
ing letting Hisanori Takahashi 
walk after a phenomenal (and 
cheap) season.
What’s another difference 
between the Mets and the 
Rays? The Rays won their di-
vision in 2008 and 2010 and 
have now proven that they 
can win with what they have. 
The Mets have had the 
big money, but they ? nished 
fourth in 2009 and 2010. As 
this off-season comes to a 
close, there’s no telling how 
2011 will play out for those 
having, well, off offseasons. 
2010 losers like the Orioles 
and Brewers have done what 
they need to in order to con-
tend this year, while peren-
nial behemoths like Boston 
and New York will look to 
make those moves moot. But 
winners or losers, off-seasons 
or on-seasons, there are only 
four more weeks until hope 
springs eternal for all.

As the current team leader in points 
scored, ? eld goals, and rebounds for 
the women’s basketball team, center 
Emily Peel is making Carnegie Mellon 
history. Just last week, Peel recorded a 
double-double against UAA opponent 
Brandeis University, and she helped 
the Tartans pull off a near-upset before 
falling 65–62.
 Although the team is still young 
with a large ? rst-year and sophomore 
base, Peel said the past two games 
against Case Western Reserve Univer-
sity and Brandeis have shown signi? -
cant improvement from the beginning 
of the season, as the team gains more 
experience and plays together more. 
“We’re playing with good inten-
sity and it’s exciting. I score a good 
amount, but it wouldn’t happen with-
out the help of my teammates,” Peel 
said. “It’s good this year because we 
have such a big bench and so many 
good and talented players, and I know 
it’s going to click soon.” 
Peel is a native of Long Valley, N.J., 
and is majoring in decision science. 
Like most athletes who chose to go 
plaid because of the university’s strong 
academics and athletics, Peel was 
drawn to Carnegie Mellon because of 
its programs, a great team, and the city 
of Pittsburgh, where she was born be-
fore moving to New Jersey. 
Peel has her mind set on working 
in the health ? eld one day and plans 
to pick up a second major in policy 
management or business 
before hopefully complet-
ing a master’s in health and 
public policy at the Heinz 
College.
 Although Peel entered 
Carnegie Mellon as a biolo-
gy major wanting a career in 
medicine, she switched over 
after realizing one doesn’t 
have to be a doctor to be in a 
health-related ? eld. Her ulti-
mate goal is to help prevent 
diseases, get awareness out 
about health concerns, and 
help people in general.
When not in class or 
on the court, Peel enjoys 
spending time with her 
friends on the team and 
dedicates her time to the 
Student Athlete Advisory 
Committee. 
As for the future of the 
team, Peel is optimistic about 
the coming years. “I de? -
nitely have seen tons of im-
provement over the season, 
and the chemistry is building 
between players,” she said. “It’s 
been awesome how phenom-
enal everyone has been playing. 
We’ve played two tough teams so 
far and we’ve kept up with them. 
There are ? ve freshmen and four 
sophomores this year, and al-
though the sophomores are a little 
older, we don’t have that much ex-
perience. But the more experience 
we get, the better we should do.”

All it took was a block at 
the buzzer to secure a victory 
for the Tartans.
First-year Chris Manoli 
blocked the potential game-
winning basket by the 13th-
ranked Brandeis Judges with 
less than three seconds in the 
game, ending the battle at a 
score of 53–52 and giving the 
Tartans their fourth win of 
the season for a record of 4–8 
overall and 1–1 in UAA. The 
game ended an 11-game win 
streak for the Judges, provid-
ing them with their season’s 
? rst loss.
The beginning of the ? rst 
period was controlled by 
Brandeis, as the Tartans’ cold 
shooting performance led to 
a 21–13 de? cit.  The Tartans 
missed seven straight ? eld 
goal attempts in that period.
But the Tartans would gain 
momentum, tying the score 
at 29–29 with 2:25 left in the 
half.  The run was led by an 
offensive burst from the tre-
mendously versatile Manoli, 
who hit two consecutive ? eld 
goals during the run that led 
to the tie score.
After one half, the score 
was 34–31 in favor of the 
Brandeis Judges.  It was a 
three-point shoot-out through 
one half of play, as both teams 
shot at an alarming rate from 
a distance.
The Tartans came out of 
the locker room re-energized 
after the half. They opened 
up a 12–3 run. With 7:12 left 
in the game, the Tartans held 
their largest lead, 46–38. But 
it was a strong defensive front 
during a 12-minute stretch 
that allowed the Tartans to 
build this momentum, where 
the Judges were held with-

The men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving teams 
hosted Kenyon College and 
Allegheny College last Sat-
urday. Both the men’s and 
women’s teams fell to Kenyon 
but topped Allegheny in the 
tri-meet. It was the Tartans’ 
? rst competition since re-
turning from their winter 
training trip to Miami, Fla., 
and the team’s hard work led 
to some impressive perfor-
mances.
The Tartan women got 
impressive all-around perfor-
mances from ? rst-year Soleil 
Phan and senior Molly Evans, 
who were both part of Carn-
egie Mellon’s winning 200-
yard medley relay along with 
sophomore Breanna Stillo 
and senior Brianne Burton. 
Phan also ? nished second in 
the 200 freestyle with a time 
of 1:56.79, and she overtook 
Kenyon’s Kati Meirs in the ? -
nal lap of the 500 freestyle to 
? nish third with an in-season 
time of 5:09.07. Evans ? n-
ished second in the 100-yard 
backstroke and won the 200 
back, but her best perfor-
mance came in the 400 IM, 
when she won the event and 
broke her own 2009 pool re-
cord with a time of 4:29.44.
The top performer for the 
men was senior Alex Hanson. 
Hanson, a three-time par-
ticipant at the NCAA Cham-
pionships and a 2010 All-
American, ? nished second in 
both the 200 free and the 200 
breaststroke, going an in-sea-
son best 2:11.31 in the latter 
event. Like Evans, Hanson’s 
top performance was also in 
the 400 IM. Hanson won and, 
not to be outdone by his fe-
male counterpart, broke the 
men’s nine-year-old pool re-
cord in the event with a time 
of 4:06.51.
The Tartans will host 
another tri-meet this Satur-
day. The meet against West-
minster College and SUNY 
Geneseo will mark the senior 
swimmers’ ? nal career home 
meet. The meet will be at the 
University Center pool start-
ing at 1 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team fell 
three points short to UAA ri-
val Brandeis University on 
Friday, losing to the visiting 
Judges 65–62. The Tartans 
fell to 2–11 on the season and 
are 0–2 in UAA play.
During the ? rst half, it 
was apparent that the Tar-
tans had taken their game up 
a notch, and Carnegie Mellon 
held the lead at halftime for 
the ? rst time in six years. Ju-
nior Jennifer Larsen stepped 
up and scored for the Tar-
tans on their ? rst possession, 
starting a personal hot streak 
that ended with 10 points 
in the ? rst half, including a 
three-pointer. Junior Nicole 
Vaccarella added to the Tar-
tans’ lead with a three-point 
basket of her own in the ? rst 
half. However, Brandeis took 
a run at the Tartans and went 
on an 8–2 streak to end the 
half, putting their de? cit at 
32–26.
At the start of the second 
half, the Judges picked up 
right where they had left off 
after their eight-point run. 
The Judges came out and 
took control of the ? oor, start-
ing off with 11 points while 
only allowing the Tartans 
two, giving Brandeis a 37–34 
lead. The Tartans pushed 
forward with a free throw by 
Vaccarella and two fast break 
layups by ? rst-year Jacquie 
Shaw. Both, however, were 
answered with nine points 
by the Judges. The Judges 
? nished the game making six 
out of eight free throws in the 
last minute.
Overall, the Tartans saw 
outstanding performances 
from Vaccarella and sopho-
more Emily Peel, who each 
came up with 14 points. Peel 
had another double-double 
this game when she scored 
11 rebounds as well.
Despite the loss, the game 
was all about ? ghting for the 
Tartans, who played without 
this year’s top scorer, junior 
Jacki Cortese. “I think every-
one played together with a lot 
of intensity; it was especially 
great to see on the defensive 
end,” Peel said.
The Tartans had big shoes 
to ? ll and proved that they 
could all elevate their game. 
“The way we played that 
game showed every team in 
the UAA that we can compete 
with everyone and beat any-
one,” continued Peel.
The Tartans secured their 
? rst conference win when 
they played host to UAA rival 
New York University yester-
day at 2 p.m.

Valentine’s Day is exactly 
four weeks from now and 
folks, there’s no need to buy 
any gifts this year. It just so 
happens that Major League 
Baseball has already taken 
care of that for us. Sure, you 
and your hubby can spend 
a romantic dinner together, 
maybe even see a movie. 
But then you can go home 
and revel in the joy that this 
Feb. 14 is the day pitchers 
and catchers report to of? -
cially begin spring training. If 
that’s not enough of a gift for 
you, then maybe plane tick-
ets to Florida and/or Arizona 
would seal the deal.
Speaking of deals, this off-
season has been chock full of 
’em. Perhaps most notably, 
Cliff Lee spurned the Yankees 
and surprised everyone by 
signing with the Philadelphia 
Phillies — yes, the same Phil-
lies that traded him for Roy 
Halladay only a year ago and 
then acquired Roy Oswalt 
at the deadline. Although 
all three could be the stand-
out aces of any major league 
staff, they instead ? nd them-
selves joined by Cole Hamels 
in the most formidable rota-
tion in baseball. Is Halladay-
Lee-Oswalt going to match 
Smoltz-Maddux-Glavine in 
dominance and sheer intimi-
dation? No. Hudson-Zito-
Mulder? Maybe. The latter 
trio was totally homegrown 
in the A’s system, which made 
them all the more likable, es-
pecially when the A’s start-
ers won 15 games during the 
team’s 20-game win streak in 
2002. While the Braves’ trio 
was not as technically home-
grown — Smoltz came in a 
Ryan-Fergosi-esque deal from 
the Tigers and Maddux had 
already established himself 
with the Cubs — by the time 
the trio was ? nished pitching 
in Atlanta, they’d certainly 
become household names. 
No doubt all three will go into 
the Hall of Fame donning 
Braves caps. Give Halladay, 
Lee, and Oswalt another ? ve 
years together and maybe the 
comparisons will start to ? ow 
a little more easily.
The Phillies have not been 
the only big winners this off-
season. Until the Lee deal, 
the Boston Red Sox were — 
and still should be — consid-
ered the big winners of the 
off-season. Within a week, 
the Sox traded for ? rst base-
man Adrian Gonzalez and 
signed the Yankees’ second-
most coveted free agent, left 
? elder Carl Crawford. Gon-
zalez, especially playing in 
Fenway Park, could become 
the best ? rst baseman in the 
game, even surpassing that 
guy Albert on the Cardinals. 
His ? elding is already second 
to none, and his opposite-
? eld stroke will no doubt 
bene? t from a short porch in 
left. Crawford — whom the 
Yankees really didn’t need, 
so much as want — gives the 
Red Sox a legitimate speed-
ster who can play any out? eld 
position better than who they 
have already and who will no 
doubt bene? t from a short 
porch in right. More impor-
tantly — knock on wood — 
Crawford has done a pretty 
good job of staying healthy 
over his career, which is more 
than Boston can say for most 
of its roster, and especially its 
out? eld. With Crawford and 
Gonzalez in tow and leading 
the charge, the Sox are easy 
favorites to win the AL East.
But don’t worry, Yankees 
fans; all is not lost. The Yanks 
just signed setup man Rafael 
Soriano to a three-year, $35 
million contract. Aside from 
the fact that they have now 
dedicated $65 million this off-
season to ? ve years’ worth of 
two relievers — Mariano got 
$30 million for two years ear-
lier this winter — the move 
does give the Yankees a for-
midable setup-closer duo on 
paper. Whether Soriano, who 
wasn’t always a closer before 
dominating for Tampa Bay 
last year, can be as effective 
in a non-closing role as the 
Yanks hope he will remains to 
be seen. The Red Sox are hop-
ing to get similar results from 
Bobby Jenks this year, but as 
J.J. Putz and the New York 
Mets can attest — and the Red 
Sox and Eric Gagne, for that 
matter — things don’t always 
go according to plan. While I 
understand that Soriano will 
no doubt replace Rivera once 
the latter ? nally does retire, 
that day shouldn’t arrive un-
til the last year of Soriano’s 
contract at the earliest. If Ri-
vera’s next two seasons are 
successful, it may take even 
longer. Other teams, like the 
Brewers, Rangers, and Cubs, 
have made big moves this 
winter as well. That said, 
the off-season hasn’t been 
kind to everyone. In every 
big trade, there is the team 
that is losing its star player, 
and in every big free agent 
acquisition, there arwe the 
teams that lose out on sign-
ing him. The Angels inexpli-

Everything you need to know
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
Last night, I was at a 
friendly social event. 
After a few hours of 
revelry with compatriots, 
I went to the refreshments 
table to receive another 
beverage. However, upon 
reaching said table, two 
gentlemen inquired as 
to my knowledge of any 
fellow socialites, refusing 
to allow me to re? ll my 
glass until I answered. 
When I informed them 
they were being rather 
rude, they asked me to 
leave. I, hoping to avoid 
confrontation, did so. 
My dear sir, how should I 
handle such an encounter 
in the future?
Sincerely,
Gingerly Expecting Nice 
Time
Dear Gent,
You probably did something 
to offend them. I would 
suggest at your next “friendly 
social event” you have a 
little less “refreshment.” The 
two gentlemen in question 
seemed to be looking for a 
? ght, and you provided them 
an easy opportunity. You 
acted correctly in avoiding 
the ? ght, but you probably 
could have stopped the 
conversation sooner. Either 
only go to events where you 
actually know people, or 
instead inform those hosts 
that upon entering, you had 
already paid the proper price 
of admission.
Always be polite,
Brian Hoskins
Dear Hoskins Brothers,
I’m having trouble getting 
back into the swing of 
things now that I’m back 
at school. I keep getting 
distracted by the Internet 
whenever I sit down to 
work. Do you have any tips 
on good study habits?
Sincerely,
Easily Distracted Dunce
Dear EDD,
Congratulations, you’re lazy. 
The Internet just offers you an 
easy way to avoid working. 
If you ? nd yourself visiting a 
few sites all the time, there 
are some easy ways to block 
those sites. If you use a Mac 
or Linux, you can easily edit 
your host ? le so you cannot 
connect to those sites. If 
you use Chrome, there’s 
a great extension called 
ChromeNanny that limits your 
daily access to any websites 
you choose. There are similar 
extensions for Firefox. A quick 
Google search should bring 
up any number of them. 
Try making a schedule, so you 
know what to do and when 
to do it. Give yourself some 
time to play and time to work. 
If you know what you need to 
be doing, you won’t have an 
excuse to procrastinate. You 
just have to be disciplined.
Buckle down,
Patrick Hoskins

Mystery theme, myriad of prizes make evening a success
How often is it possible to enter a realm of mystery, 
to visit Wonderland and have a tea party, to 
investigate a homicide, or to have a party with 
aliens? Probably not very often, but at this year’s 
Winter Gala all these things, and more, became a 
reality.
Every year for the past nine years, the Office of 
Student Activities has set up the Winter Gala 
with the help of other campus offices as an 
event to welcome students back to school for the 
spring semester. According to Taylor Grabowsky, 
a coordinator of Student Activities and the 
mastermind behind this event, this year’s mystery 
theme is a “dark and brooding” contrast to the 
“bright and fun” themes of past galas.
This year’s gala featured seven themed rooms 
with an overall theme of mystery. Kirr Commons in 
the University Center became Tudor Manor for an 
evening based on the board game Clue, with all the 
members of the Student Activities staff dressed as 
characters from the game. Upon entering the gala, 
students were given a ticket fashioned as a board 
game and at each room received a sticker on their 
ticket. Once all the stickers were collected, the 
tickets were entered into the grand prize drawing 
for an Xbox 360 and a $50 Best Buy gift card. Each 
of the different rooms had its own drawings for other 
prizes, including games, DVDs, gift cards, and many 
other appealing items.
The variety of creative themes established a whole 
world of mystery. Each room had its own special 
attributes that channeled the theme of mystery 
in different ways. One theme was “Wonderland,” 
based on two of the best-known characters from 
the story, the Red Queen and the Mad Hatter. The 
Queen’s side had a Valentine’s Day feel, while the 
Mad Hatter’s side was boisterous, colorful, and fun. 
Another room’s theme was “Area 51,” which had a 
club atmosphere with an eerie alien vibe. The theme 
“221 Baker Street” was dedicated to the legendary 
detective Sherlock Holmes, and participants 
were asked to solve a mystery. The room for the 
“Legends and Monsters” theme had activities for 
the participants such as making monster masks, 
creating a monster legend, getting tarot card 
readings, as well as an open mic to voice their talent 
(or just sing for fun) on stage.
“Halloween Town” was a theme based on the movie 
The Nightmare Before Christmas. There was free 
hair styling, pictures with Jack Skellington, and, of 
course, plenty of candy. The room themed “Night 
at the Museum” gave participants the chance to 
dress up as historical characters, build a dinosaur 
or sphinx, or turn their friend into a mummy. Finally, 
the “Department of Mysteries” theme was a thrill 
for Harry Potter fans. This room featured a sorting 
hat, floating dementors, butterbeer on tap, and other 
interesting elements that brought this theme to life. 
In addition to these themed rooms, Rangos Hall was 
set up as a casino where students could get chips 
and tokens to try their luck and win raffle tickets for 
the many prize drawings.
There was a large turnout for this spectacular event, 
and it was a great chance for students to relax and 
have fun. “I wasn’t expecting much when I got 
there, but once I got there, I got wrapped up in the 
whole mood of it all and the themes of the different 
rooms,” said sophomore Tepper School of Business 
student Alysia Finger. “Even though I didn’t win 
anything, I still had a really great time.” Assuredly, 
there will be many people looking forward to 
attending next year’s Winter Gala.

Tales from abroad: Granada
From the Alhambra to Morocco, from Spanish to Arabic, and everything in between
When I ? rst got to Granada, it was a bit overwhelming. 
My host family did not speak a word of English and 
they spoke very, very quickly. Needless to say, it took 
some getting used to. My host family consisted of a 
mother and her three children, all of whom were in their 
twenties and living at home. At ? rst this was a bit weird, 
until I learned that compared to the U.S., there are not 
many countries that expect children to move out of their 
houses the minute they hit 18 years of age. Fascinating. 
But then again, a 29-year-old woman still living with her 
mother is still a little too strange for me to fully support.
We visited the Alhambra, which is the last remaining 
Arab fortress in Spain from before the Christian 
Reconquista. It was really interesting, since that is 
where Granada gets its prominent Arabic culture and is 
what the city is known for. From the top of the Alhambra, 
you can see the entire city of Granada and distinguish 
its different sections, from the Gypsy caves to the center 
of the city.
Orientation consisted of three hours of class a day for 
two weeks of a Spanish language immersion program. 
Orientation also allowed us to get used to a very odd 
eating schedule and the way of dress, in addition to 
learning our way around Granada while still taking some 
sort of class. This new lifestyle was de? nitely hard to 
get used to, considering it was dif? cult to simply ? nd a 
person to whom I could speak English.
Orientation ended with a four-day trip to Morocco. We 
started with the port city of Algeciras — which would 
make you want to go right back to where you came 
from. After staying there for one night, we were off to 
Morocco.
The ? rst place we visited once we got to Morocco was a 
women’s shelter, which takes in uneducated, troubled, 
divorced, or abused women. This shelter teaches them 
a trade — working with textiles in this instance, which 
is a large market in Morocco — and provides them the 
opportunity to get a job in that particular trade. We had 
lunch and discussed many of the women’s views on 
women in general, marriage, and modernization, topics 
over which even the program participants disagreed 
enormously.
Clearly, there was a lot on the agenda. Staying with host 
families in Morocco was interesting because our host 
mother didn’t speak a word of English or Spanish (only 
Arabic and French), which created some dif? culty when 
trying to communicate. Mostly, it was a two-day game of 
charades.
There was a lot of traveling, but Morocco was a 
beautiful and very accepting country, especially to a 
group of American students. The students we spoke to 
repeatedly emphasized that Morocco was the ? rst nation 
to recognize the United States as a country, and was 
the ? rst to have a U.S. embassy outside of the United 
States. It was as if they were trying to convince us that 
they were good people and didn’t dislike us, despite 
a few prejudices some people in the U.S. share. It was 
comforting that they were able to look at a group of 
American students and just see us, not what our country 
represented, whereas in America, we tend to do the 
complete opposite.
Some people in other programs made vows to only speak 
Spanish whilst there; however, with my busy schedule 
on top of the fact that no one in my house spoke English, 
this vow seemed redundant and unnecessary.
The most shocking part of living abroad was the 
difference in what was considered “newsworthy” 
compared to that of the U.S. Con? icts like the one 
between Morocco and the Western Sahara, which would 
not even be mentioned in most newspapers in the 
United States, were front-page news abroad.
I highly recommend studying abroad when given the 
option. I got to live in Spain and practice Spanish while 
traveling every weekend to various countries including 
Ireland, Italy, Austria, Morocco, and Portugal. I surfed for 
the ? rst time in Lagos and played ultimate Frisbee in a 
foreign country. It is de? nitely an experience that I will 
never forget.

Paperhouse
On “made-up songs”
Things are confusingly scary. From UPS’s intimidatingly 
ef? cient human and technological infrastructure to the 
underlying motivations for military operations in the Middle 
East, things are weird. For something closer to home, let’s 
just think about the fact that the majority of the music that 
you’ve ever listened to has most likely been ? ltered by lossy 
data compression. Bizarre, right? When was the last time 
your body and eardrums experienced the real-time creation 
of music? Even for you audiophiles, when was the last time 
you experienced the simultaneity of a mallet hitting a timpani 
and its thunderous vibration? What about the molar-piercing 
shriek of a live electric guitar? I know, friends, it’s been a 
while.
Our lives have been devoid of the joy of the experience of 
music!
In my eyes, this is where live performances play such a crucial 
role. Shows, recitals, and concerts are great, but to really 
get at the heart of the matter, why aren’t we singing every 
day? If you have a friend who likes to sing, let him sing about 
his trombone sandwiches. If your other friend likes to make 
up spontaneous songs and funny sounds as she walks to 
the supermarket, let her! In my mind, there is nothing more 
intimate than being in the presence of the creation of music. 
Even if it’s your friend trying to make weird noises with his 
throat out in the cold while he waits for the bus, it’s absolutely 
beautiful. As humans, these friends of yours are interpreting 
the rhythmic patterns and sounds of the musical and non-
musical world around them. They’re claiming the essence of 
those worlds as their own.
My tip to you, friend? If you’ve only been a listener, I highly 
suggest you try to become a music maker. Pick up an 
instrument. Sing a made-up song in a new language. And 
hey, if being a music maker is too tough, just be a noisemaker. 
You’ll be the better for it, I promise.
Kisses,

‘Rain’ a worthy experience
Beatles tribute band takes audiences back in time
The first noticeable characteristic of “Rain: A 
Tribute to The Beatles” when walking into Heinz 
Hall was the audience. Although The Beatles are 
cross-generational, on Tuesday night Pittsburgh’s 
older generation dominated the audience. Now, a 
production packed with the city’s baby boomers 
may not sound particularly appealing, but really, 
there is no other way to listen to 1960s music 
live. Listening to The Beatles with a crowd who 
actually lived in the ’60s, one begins to see their 
younger selves shine through. One becomes privy 
to watching an overweight senior couple perform a 
cross between a Flower Child dance and the Twist 
and laugh at jokes about drugs.
From Jan. 11 to 16, Heinz Hall presented “Rain: A 
Tribute to The Beatles,” an interactive, live concert 
hailed by the Denver Post as “the closest thing to 
seeing The Beatles live today.” Annerin Productions, 
together with Magic Arts & Entertainment/TIX 
Corporation, ensured a fun concert with a band that 
sounded true to the originals they emulated.
Tuesday night’s show was somewhat tailored to 
an older audience. The music was not deafening, 
to the chagrin of some teenagers there. Despite 
these teenagers’ unhappiness, it was a good choice; 
being able to actually hear the performers play and 
sing gave credit to their work as impersonators and 
helped enhance the experience of listening to live, 
good-quality music. The set list included songs such 
as “Let It Be,” “Hey Jude,” and “Sergeant Pepper’s 
Lonely Hearts Club Band.”
The band was made up of Jim Irizarry (acting as 
John Lennon), Mac Ruffing (Paul McCartney), Jimmy 
Pou (George Harrison), and Douglas Cox (Ringo 
Starr). The performers were older, so the further the 
program went into The Beatles’ later music, the 
more they seemed to resemble the actual Beatles 
members. Irizarry was spot-on: Not only did he look 
like Lennon, but he sounded just like him as well. 
Ruffing had a tough role; while he looked just like 
an older version of Paul McCartney, his voice was 
a little too high. One of the best performers in the 
group perhaps was Pou, a Cuban man who was a 
skilled guitar player and whose love of music shone 
through his performance. Cox was a solid drummer, 
and, for two of the songs, a solid singer. 
The multimedia portion of the show was one of 
the highlights of the night. The images and videos 
that played during the show served as a historical 
testament both to The Beatles’ overwhelming 
presence in the 1960s and to the dramatic, world-
changing events of their time. The program was 
ordered chronologically, so as the performers 
changed costumes, the music evolved and the 
projected images fast-forwarded in history. As one 
watched, one slowly became aware of being an 
outsider to a time of intense activity.
All in all, going to see “Rain” was essentially going to 
watch a pretty good cover band get all the applause 
and accolades for music written by possibly the 
most successful band in history. That is not to say 
that it was not a fun and entertaining experience, or 
that the musicians were somehow subpar or sloppy. 
It is to say, though, that no one could experience the 
intense and mind-boggling enormity of a live Beatles 
concert today.

Like any year, 2010 proved to be a whirlwind series 
of ups and downs for music. We saw the deaths of 
Jay Reatard and Mark Linkous, leader of the band 
Sparklehorse. Some artists were imprisoned, some 
released from prison, and one (T.I.) even managed to 
? nd himself back in prison again. A video of Miley Cyrus 
smoking a bong went viral on the Internet shortly after 
her eighteenth birthday. We won’t even get started on 
Kanye West, who is a story in and of himself. 
Despite the lowlights of the year, the ups were pretty 
high. Daft Punk created arguably the best soundtrack 
of the year for the movie TRON: Legacy. Pavement got 
back together for a reunion tour. After ? ve years, Sufjan 
Stevens ? nally released another album, and a great one 
at that. Of the many album releases that de? ned the 
year, some proved more outstanding than others. 
10. Robyn, Body Talk. Body Talk manages to be 
weird without being off-putting, catchy without being 
repetitive, poppy without being overly peppy. The 
album is an explosion of dance-pop energy with 
synthetic sounds and heavy drum beats. Robyn weaves 
stories with her songs, talking about the push and pull 
of a no-strings-attached relationship in “Hang With Me,” 
and the heartache of a girl watching the guy she loves 
dance with someone else in “Dancing On My Own.” 
Robyn centers her songs around energetic melodies, 
never letting the meaning behind the songs weigh them 
down.
9. Vampire Weekend, Contra. A case of sophomore 
album syndrome clearly does not apply to Vampire 
Weekend. With a debut as strong as their namesake 
album, it’s hard to imagine the band topping their ? rst 
success, but in Contra, Vampire Weekend exceeded 
expectations and released a sophomore album to 
remember. With its Afro-pop in? uences and synthetic 
sounds, the quartet manages to perfect the balance 
between staying true its roots and experimenting with 
new ideas. 
8. Bruno Mars, Doo-Wops and Hooligans. Few artists 
manage to make a splash before releasing an album, 
much less turn that splash into a tidal wave, but Bruno 
Mars is just such an artist. Mars lent his voice to B.o.B’s 
“Nothin’ On You” and Travie McCoy’s “Billionaire,” 
both hit songs on Top 40 radio stations. Then, he blew 
America away with the single “Just The Way You Are,” 
melting many girls’ hearts in the process. His songs are 
catchy without being generic, and he has one of the best 
male voices in the popular music industry — two key 
ingredients to the success of his debut album.
7. Big Boi, Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico 
Dusty. “No, not André 3000. The other guy.” However 
unfair this statement might be, there is always the 
member that is the lesser known in a two-part band. 
After this album, there is no way that Big Boi could stay 
the “other member” of OutKast for long. The album is 
spectacular and anything but predictable. Big Boi is 
heavily in? uenced by Southern hip hop, as well as funk 
and dub-step. He uses clever wordplay and delivers fast-
paced lyrics that leave listeners breathless.
6. Beach House, Teen Dream. Victoria Legrand’s 
voice is captivating, and while it is sometimes hard to 
understand exactly what she is saying, her melodies, 
along with the rich sounds of the keyboard and Alex 
Scally’s guitar, make the album more than worth 
listening to. The tracks are diverse, ranging from somber 
to dramatic. “Silver Soul” is gloomy and emotional, while 
“Norway” is ethereal. 
5. Sleigh Bells, Treats. Riding the wave of praise from 
their South by Southwest show, this lo-?  duo released 
their much anticipated album in May. Some songs are 
grainy, while others are screechy in an over-excitable, 
in-your-face type of way. The album is a combination of 
strength and silliness, with decibel-overloading poppy 
beats and quirky lyrics that appeal to the masses while 
still satisfying music connoisseurs.
4. LCD Soundsystem, This Is Happening. 
Supposedly LCD Soundsystem’s ? nal album, This is 
Happening certainly leaves listeners something great to 
remember them by. The album touches on relationships, 
and has a darker feel than the previous album Sounds 
of Silver without actually sombering up the melodies. 
Single “Drunk Girls” seems all fun and games at ? rst, but 
after paying attention to the lyrics, listeners will realize 
that the song is infused with deeper realizations.
3. Local Natives, Gorilla Manor. As far as debut 
albums go, Local Natives could not have done a better 
job. There is something inexplicably appealing about 
their raw, heart-wrenching vocals and clever harmonies. 
Among the twelve tracks is a little gem in the form of 
a cover of Talking Heads’ “Warning Sign.” Perhaps the 
most amazing part of the album is how the quintet 
manages to sound melancholy and lighthearted at 
the same time. The resulting blend is a unique sound 
that keeps listeners hooked, leaving the band with a 
dedicated fan base.
2. Arcade Fire, The Suburbs. It would seem, with this 
third-straight spectacular album, that Arcade Fire can 
do no wrong. Somehow, the band always manages to 
make profound statements accompanied by clever tunes 
without coating their songs in a layer of depression. The 
tracks are monumental without being heavy, inspiring 
listeners to consider the lifestyle of the suburbs. Perhaps 
one of the most memorable lines about suburban life is in 
“Sprawl II”: “Sometimes I wonder if the world’s so small, 
that we can never get away from the sprawl.”
1. Kanye West, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. 
It might seem cliché to put Kanye at the top of a best 
albums list, but frankly, there is no other place to put 
Twisted Fantasy. True to its name, the album reveals the 
inner workings of Kanye’s mind — the somber, the crazy, 
the honest, and the heartfelt. The tracks range from the 
aggressive — especially Nicki Minaj’s part in “Monster” 
— to the candid. Kanye manages to bring out his own 
humanity, showing us that despite his oftentimes 
invincible appearance, he has his faults and is well 
aware of his vulnerability.

“We all know the story.”
So begins the immersion into the world of Swan Lake, as 
performed by the New York Ballet Company in the movie 
Black Swan. One dancer, Nina Sayers (portrayed by 
Natalie Portman), has the talent and the determination 
to be a star. Her technique is textbook perfection, but 
her ? awlessness breeds an inability to lose herself 
emotionally in the role of the Black Swan. As the pure 
and angelic White Swan, Nina is an undeniable choice. 
But as the White Swan’s evil twin, the seductive Black 
Swan, Nina is not as convincing.
Nonetheless, she lands the dual role, and performs much 
to expectation: a perfect White Swan, but an emotionless 
Black Swan. It’s only when Thomas (Vincent Cassel), the 
ballet director who does not shy away from sexuality or 
bold questions, shows his disappointment in her that 
Nina steps up her game.
Further fueling the ? re is Lily (Mila Kunis), an equally 
beautiful dancer who personi? es the Black Swan to a T. 
Early on, Nina looks at her with disgust, but as the ? lm 
progresses, Lily tries to help Nina “relax” and show some
rebellion. Through drugs, ? irtation, and some very not-
for-kids girl-on-girl loving, Nina begins to lose herself in 
the role of the Black Swan. But her goal (“to be perfect”) 
comes at a price: She is haunted by visions and scarred 
by scratches. The ? lm’s beginning is a bit slow-moving, 
but this helps viewers get settled and feel comfortable 
in the world until, all of a sudden, they’re thrown around 
turns and dropped off ledges as they spiral downward 
along with Nina.
And suddenly comes opening night. In the ? rst act as 
the White Swan, Nina dances with perfect fragility and 
sensitive vulnerability. However, when Nina returns to 
her dressing room to prepare for her transition to the evil 
character, all hell breaks loose.
Nina isn’t discomforted by ? ying solo. Her desire to be 
the main dancer often leaves her the subject of snide 
comments and spiteful glances. Further adding to her 
anti-fan base is Beth (portrayed by ex-sticky ? ngers 
Winona Ryder) as the former prima ballerina and face 
of the New York Ballet Company. Her subjectively older 
age has forced her to be replaced by younger and fresher 
dancers, though to the public, she is “choosing to retire.” 
Also complicating things is Nina’s mother (Barbara 
Hershey), an overly controlling former dancer who resorts 
to morose paintings when she’s not living vicariously 
through her daughter. Her excessive protection is 
initially comforting to delicate Nina, but as Nina turns 
into the Black Swan, this security eventually smothers 
her, and she rebels violently.
Director Darren Aronofsky takes us on a horrifying and 
thrilling journey, where the beginning is so far from 
the ? nale that you feel a bit exhausted along with the 
characters, but you also can’t help but thank him. There 
are genuine thrills in the movie as it warps and confuses 
the boundaries of reality and consciousness. It’s 
beautifully ? lmed (not surprising from the Requiem for 
a Dream director), and even though the ? lm ends with a 
standing ovation, you aren’t quite sure if the applause is 
well deserved or incredibly tragic.

Trainspotting is a 1996 ? lm directed by 
Danny Boyle about drug addiction and 
life in an economically depressed area of 
Britain. Based on the novel of the same 
name, the ? lm follows Renton, a man 
deeply embedded in drug culture, as he 
tries to clean up his act and get out of 
Dodge, so to speak. It’s a very surreal 
movie, with scenes of wild extremes that 
help push along the controversial and 
sometimes trippy story. Trainspotting 
was also recently voted the best ? lm 
in Scottish history and has a strong 
cult following. Fun Fact: The movie has 
nothing to do with trains.

Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim rolls all

novel of the same name. In the ? lm, 
Pilgrim meets the girl of his dreams 
(sound familiar?) and, in order to win 
her over, must defeat her seven evil 
exes, each of whom attempts to kill 
him. The movie is played out as an 
arcade game with several references 
that video game fanboys are sure to 
love. Despite being well received by 
critics, the movie did poorly at the

its budget. Make sure that doesn’t

Strange events begin to happen to 
a couple, so they set up cameras 
to ? gure out what could possibly 
be going on. Similar to the way the

Today marks an important day in American history. It is 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, dedicated to a man who is 
revered for his ideas of social justice, racial equity, and 
nonviolent protest. Nearly 40 years after King’s death in 
1968 and more than 20 years after the holiday was ? rst 
signed into law and commemorated, Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day holds a unique position among national holidays.
To begin with, its history is a controversial one. 
Although Ronald Reagan signed the day into law in 
1983, it was ? rst observed in 1986. Numerous states 
and their representatives resisted the attempts to make 
the holiday of? cial, or chose to recognize the holiday 
with alternative names. Taking an extreme stance on 
the issue, South Carolina did not recognize Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day as a paid holiday until 2000, the 
? rst year the holiday was of? cially observed by all 50 
states. Instead, the state offered employees the choice 
of celebrating either King’s birthday or one of three 
Confederate holidays. In Virginia, Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day was recognized as Lee-Jackson-King Day, 
juxtaposing the names of two Confederate heroes with 
that of King.
More conventional recognitions of Martin Luther King
Jr. Day have since taken precedence. Former 
Pennsylvania Senator Harris Wofford and Georgia 
Representative John Lewis created the King Holiday and 
Service Act, urging Americans to participate in a day of 
service intended to honor King. First-year Arshia Ahuja 
agrees with this method of memorializing King. “Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day is an opportunity for service,” she 
said. “It’s a time for re? ection — Dr. King’s life and efforts 
affected everybody.”
King’s life was indeed an illustrious one. Most Americans 
are familiar with his “I Have a Dream” speech, delivered 
on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and are aware of 
his numerous marches and protests, and of his sacri? ces 
while in jail. However, there remain some facts about 
his life and work which are not widely known. King 
wrote several books, from The Measure of a Man in 1959, 
to Strength to Love in 1963 and Why We Can’t Wait, 
published in 1964. His books respectively explore the 
theology concerning nonviolent activism, a collection 
of some of his most famous sermons, and an analysis 
of both civil rights history and the next steps toward 
social justice in America. There is also a posthumously 
published collection of his speeches titled I Have a 
Dream: Writings and Speeches That Changed the World.
In addition to his well-known civil rights work, King was 
also an avid anti-war protestor, and he spent the last few 
years of his life speaking out against the Vietnam War. 
He also worked with unions throughout the country in an 
attempt to improve economic inequalities. The youngest 
person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, King is also one 
of 10 designated 20th-century world martyrs to have a 
statue at Westminster Abbey in London.
Carnegie Mellon is giving students, faculty, and staff the 
afternoon of Martin Luther King Jr. Day off for service 
purposes. The administration has several programs 
planned for the day, including addresses, forums, and 
readings to commemorate King’s life. Local institutions 
throughout Pittsburgh have also planned events for the 
celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Western 
Pennsylvania Diversity Initiative has planned a 2011 
MLK Day Community Service Project, during which they 
will be partnering with Pittsburgh Cares, a volunteer 
organization dedicated to increasing community 
engagement, to create a ful? lling and altruistic program.
Multiple arts organizations throughout the city also will

Museums of Art and Natural History will have free 
admission and parking today. In addition, the Pittsburgh 
Glass Center is offering a day of free mosaic making, 
glass blowing, and ? ame working demonstrations. East 
Liberty’s Kelly-Strayhorn Theater is hosting a celebratory 
event with music and dance from groups including the 
YMCA Westinghouse Lighthouse Project and the Alumni 
Theater Company. The August Wilson Center opens a 
new exhibit titled Civil Rights Superheroes on Monday in 
honor of King. Created to demonstrate the effectiveness 
of comic books and cartoons in bringing people to the 
civil rights movement, the exhibit is based on the 1958 
comic book Civil Rights Superheroes: Martin Luther King 
and the Montgomery Story and includes letters from 
King.
Local efforts and plans for Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day re? ect Pittsburgh’s extensive civil rights history. 
Although Pittsburgh may not be the ? rst location that 
comes to mind when one thinks of the civil rights 
movement, Pittsburgh was in fact involved in many 
key components of civil rights history in the United 
States. Pittsburgh was a key station of the Underground 
Railroad, which helped approximately 100,000 slaves 
escape from the slaveholding South into the North. 
Middle-class African-Americans in the Hill District often 
allowed runaway slaves to stay in their churches as they 
made their way further north.
The North Side, known as Allegheny in the early 1800s, 
was another local stop on the railroad. Black and white 
civil rights leaders, including African-Americans 
Martin Delany, John Vashon, and Lewis Woodson and 
whites Charles Avery, Julius Lemoyne, and Jane Grey 
Swisshelm, founded a school for black children and the 
North Side’s Avery College — both likely Underground 
Railroad stops — to provide higher education for blacks 
who were not admitted to colleges and universities.
After the Emancipation Proclamation and the end of the 
Civil War, many African-Americans came into Pittsburgh 
to work in factories in the city. Although they were free 
from slavery, they still had to battle heavy prejudice and 
racism. In response, black leaders organized several 
protests to try to combat the discrimination. The 
Pittsburgh Courier, one of the oldest and best-known 
black newspapers in the country, was founded in 1910 
and was highly in? uential in rallying people to the cause 
of civil rights. A major battle for black civil rights was 
won in 1937 when the Pittsburgh Board of Education 
hired its ? rst black teacher, Lawrence Peeler.
During World War II, the struggle for civil rights 
increased. In the years immediately following the war, 
protests for equality grew larger and more frequent. 
A member of the Urban League led pickets to force 
downtown department stores to hire black clerks. The 
Monte? ore and St. Francis hospitals began to admit 
blacks into their nursing schools, and Monte? ore 
Hospital allowed African-American doctor Charles Burks 
staff privileges — a signi? cant step forward for African-
Americans in the medical industry.
After the Supreme Court’s decision against segregation 
in Brown v. Board of Education, Pittsburgh began to 
desegregate its schools, swimming pools, and other  
institutions and began to build the Civic Arena — later 
known as the Mellon Arena — located in the Lower 
Hill. Several Pittsburghers traveled “down South” with  
freedom riders to press for civil rights in states like 
Mississippi.
In 1968, the assassination of King sparked riots in 
Pittsburgh, causing ? res to devastate regions of the 
Hill District. Ultimately, however, the foundation for a 
platform of social justice had been laid, and the city was 
able to collectively move forward to where it is today. 
Today’s celebrations will allow all of us the opportunity 
to re? ect on what it cost the nation and our city to be 
where we are today in terms of social justice and racial  
equality, and to consider and act upon what is necessary 
to move us to where we ought to be.

The intersection of Centre Avenue and Crawford Street is where the Freedom Corner memorial is located. It 
served as the initial meeting point for the 2,000 Pittsburgh citizens who gathered in 1963 to go attend the historic 
March on Washington, during which King delivered his “I Have A Dream” speech.

Freedom Corner is a memorial in the Hill District 
commemorating the civil rights marches and protests 
that took place there.

The Tartan offered a $10 prize for the

The Carnegie Tech football team lost 
in the last 45 seconds of the General 
Electric College Bowl this past Sunday 
to Hobart and William Smith Colleges. 
In losing, the Tartans missed out on a

The big news this week was that 
Carnegie Mellon switched phone

Carnegie Mellon installed the wonderful 
card access system this year, cutting 
ties with its previous policy of leaving 
all academic buildings open to the

honest, who out there would ever want 
to take advantage of that?

The men’s basketball team got off to a 
14–2 start this year, including an upset 
over Princeton University, who had 
been on a 27–0 run against Division III 
teams until they faced the Tartans. Not 
quite up to the recent UConn women’s 
basketball team streak, but we’ll take

An editorial made note of the recent 
slew of sports scandals that had been 
tarnishing athletes’ legacies. Well, time

been going on in Brett Favre’s life. Talk 
about going out on a low note.

Is your 8 a.m. class in Wean Hall consistently ruining 
your mood? Perhaps the seasonal lack of sunlight is 
casting a cloud of dreariness over your day. Between 
the new semester, the cold weather, and the short 
days, January may feel like a fairly dismal month 
thus far. However, there are some methods to boost 
your mood during the winter season.
Wake Up on Time
As tempting as it may be to hit the snooze button 
on your alarm just a few more times, that extra hour 
of sleep may be contributing to your winter blues. 
Oversleeping has been linked to depression, and, 
according to WebMD, can make your depression 
worse, since regular sleep patterns are important to 
the recovery process. So instead of sleeping in until 
4 p.m. next weekend, try setting your alarm for 11 
a.m. and spending more time awake. You might be 
surprised by how much better you feel, and how 
much more you might get accomplished that day.
Go to the Gym
Exercise releases endorphins, which are 
neurotransmitters that cause you to feel euphoric. If 
the idea of working out seems daunting, try to make 
it a social event: Find a friend who would be willing 
to go jog on the treadmills in the University Center 
with you once a week. Not only will you get to 
socialize, but you’ll also get off the treadmill feeling 
ready to take on the world.
Turn on the Lights
One of the main reasons people feel depressed 
during the winter is the lack of sunlight. According 
to MayoClinic.com, the decrease of sunlight during 
the winter may cause your serotonin levels to drop, 
directly affecting your mood. Although arti? cial 
light isn’t a perfect substitute for natural sunlight, 
staying in bright environments will help minimize 
depressive symptoms. So, next time you’re playing 
Call of Duty or writing a paper, don’t do it in the 
dark.
Eat More Tuna
Drinking hot chocolate and eating comfort food for 
dinner may sound appealing, but be careful: Your 
comforting diet may in fact be the reason you’re 
feeling so down. According to economii.com, 
sugary treats and foods with simple carbohydrates, 
such as bread, may lift your mood temporarily, but 
will eventually cause your blood sugar to crash, 
leaving you feeling even more cranky than before. 
Furthermore, a diet consisting of nothing but 
carbohydrates can leave you highly susceptible to 
colds and the ? u. Instead, try eating more vegetables 
and foods high in protein, such as turkey, chicken, 
or tuna. Not only will they give you more energy, but 
proteins are also high in tryptophan, which induces 
hormones that make you feel happier.
Having a consistent sleep schedule, exercising, and 
eating well should help bust your wintertime blues, 
or at the very least tide you over until spring break. 
However, if you ? nd that the wintertime regularly 
causes you to feel overly anxious or depressed, you 
might have a medical condition known as seasonal 
affective disorder. If you think this is the case, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Counseling and Psychological 
Services has plenty of resources to help you feel your 
best throughout the colder months in Pittsburgh.

Beating the winter blues
The weather may be frightful, but your mood shouldn’t be
Exercising can help keep your spirits up during the cold winter months.
