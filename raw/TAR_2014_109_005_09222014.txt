After being crowned Miss 
Pennsylvania 2014, junior mu-
sical theatre major Amanda 
Fallon Smith competed at the 
national Miss America Pag-
eant in Atlantic City, N.J. last 
Sunday. 
Although Miss New York, 
Kira Kazantsev, won the pag-
eant overall, Smith won the 
talent portion of the prelimi-
nary competitions and has a 
platform of “Fitness and Nu-
trition: The Key to Healthy 
Living.”
“The Miss America pag-
eant is something I’ve liter-
ally dreamed about since I 
was eight years old,” Smith 
told The Tartan, describing 
“the joy of competing and 
being able to walk on that 
stage.”
“I don’t take this opportu-
nity for granted,” she added.
Smith won the Miss Penn-
sylvania pageant after par-
ticipating in the competition 
for the ?rst time, performing 
“Music of the Night” from The 
Phantom of the Opera.
Smith is taking a year off 
from studying at Carnegie 
Mellon to ful?ll her duties 
as Miss Pennsylvania, which 
she described as traveling 
throughout the state to par-
ticipate in community service 
events and various public 
appearances. 
Smith emphasized the 
role of her community work, 
saying the job is “much 
more” than simply attending 
parades.
Smith will be traveling to 
schools within the state and 
teaching children the impor-
tance of proper nutrition, a 
topic which she says is often 
overlooked.
“It’s kind of cliché, but chil-
dren are the future,” Smith 
said. “This is the ?rst genera-
tion which is not expected to 
outlive their parents.”
“Kids are just so recep-
tive,” she said, speaking of 
her work. Smith eventually 
wants to expand her commu-
nity service-related initiatives 
to nutrition education for 
families, where she acknowl-
edges that “the major prob-
lem with nutrition is that it’s 
so expensive.” She aims to 
help develop “healthy, afford-
able plans for families,” but 
“right now, I’m really focus-
ing on the school system.”
Smith said that her Carn-
egie Mellon musical theatre 
training was helpful in pag-
eant competitions and added 
that without it, “honestly I 
don’t know if I would have had 
the con?dence.”
Smith intends to pursue 
a career related to her musi-
cal theatre training, either on 
stage in New York or on screen 
in Los Angeles.
After this year, Smith 
wishes to continue her out-
reach work related to nutri-
tion, saying “to do the service 
I want to do, I don’t need a 
crown on my head.”
She spoke highly of the 
work of the Children’s Mir-
acle Network, which is the 
competition’s national plat-
form partner, and encour-
aged members of the campus 
community to volunteer at 
Children’s Hospital of Pitts-
burgh downtown. The Chil-
dren’s Miracle Network is a 
nonprofit organization that 
raises money for children’s 
hospitals.
University enumerates measures for preventing sexual assault
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
News Editor
After the American Civil 
Liberties Union (ACLU) ?led 
a Title IX Complaint against 
Carnegie Mellon in December, 
the university became one of 
over 50 schools in the nation 
under investigation by the U.S. 
Department of Education’s Of-
?ce for Civil Rights (OCR). 
Last week, Dean of Student 
Affairs Gina Casalegno sent an 
email to the student body de-
tailing the university’s initia-
tives to combat sexual assault 
and sexual harassment.
Title IX is a section of 
the 1972 Education Amend-
ments that prohibits gender 
discrimination in education. 
The university allegedly failed 
to protect “Gabrielle” — the 
pseudonym given to the vic-
tim in the ACLU’s complaint — 
from her abusive ex-girlfriend. 
Gabrielle dated her assailant 
for six months as a ?rst-year 
student, until her “girlfriend 
became verbally and sexu-
ally abusive,” according to an 
ACLU blog post.
The complaint came only 
about six months after Carn-
egie Mellon revised its Sexual 
Assault Policy in 2013 in the 
wake of the spring 2011 “Dear 
Colleague Letter,” an open let-
ter published by the OCR that 
outlined the requirements of 
Title IX and steps that schools 
should take to comply with the 
law.
Also in 2013, the Violence 
against Women Act — com-
monly known as VAWA — was 
reauthorized by Congress. 
VAWA, originally enacted in 
1994, provides federal fund-
ing for the investigation and

Moore aims to promote research
NIVEDITA CHOPRA
Asst. Copy Manager
Andrew W. Moore, former 
vice president of engineering 
at Google, became the new 
dean of Carnegie Mellon’s 
School of Computer Science 
(SCS) in August. Moore has 
roots at Carnegie Mellon — he 
was a professor of computer 
science and robotics before he 
joined Google in 2006.
Moore helped found 
Google’s Pittsburgh of?ce, 
which was once part of Carn-
egie Mellon’s Robert Mehra-
bian Collaborative Innovation 
Center (CIC). When Google 
outgrew the CIC, however, 
Google moved to its current 
location in Bakery Square, 
where it has been since 2010. 
Moore succeeds former 
dean Randal Bryant, who 
stepped down to return to 
be part of the SCS faculty on 
June 30, after serving as dean 
of SCS since 2004.
Moore views his position 
as an administrative role, with 
an eye to some laudable goals. 
“We’re one of the few 
places in the world that are 
making the next technology 
leaders, and, across campus, 
we are doing these amazing 
things,” Moore said. “My high-
level meta-goal is producing 
these technology leaders and 
promoting research.”
With this in mind, Moore 
is brainstorming ways to 
achieve these goals. One 
thing that he is focusing on 
is removing obstacles for 
faculty members here at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“If you’re a faculty mem-
ber at any university, life 
is very exciting. There are 
things you want to build,” 
Moore said. 
But Moore says writing 
proposals and getting grants 
can be stressful. Moore hopes 
to ?nd ways to alleviate these 
worries. That way faculty 
can focus on their research, 
rather than having to deal 
with bureaucracy.
This does, however, mean 
that Moore doesn’t get much 
time to pursue his own re-
search in machine learning, 
arti?cial intelligence, and 
robotics. 
“That’s my dream, that 
some day I can get back to do-
ing some research, but I don’t 
see that happening for a year 
or two,” Moore said, noting 
that there are many excit-
ing possibilities for Carnegie 
Mellon right now, and that 
his work as dean will work to 
further the university’s role 
as a leader in technology.
Having moved from in-
dustry to academia, Moore 
is in the perfect position to 
compare industry and univer-
sity life. “Interestingly, I feel 
that being at Google is fairly 
similar to Carnegie Mellon. 
At ?rst sight, it sounds like 
they are completely different 
places; one is about educa-
tion and blue sky research, 
and the other about mak-
ing products that the world’s 
population uses. 
But when you look at 
what people are really do-
ing, at both places you have 
scrawling on whiteboards 
[and] grabbing the white-
board marker out of each 
other’s hands as they’re 
trying to write their ideas 
down. In both cases you 
have work that people are 
very passionate about,” 
Moore said.
Moore also acknowledges 
the differences between aca-
demic life and life in indus-
try. “Maybe the single most 
important thing that we’re 
doing at Carnegie Mellon is 
education. While there’s a lot 
of educating at Google, it’s 
very different from that in a 
university.”
Football team takes part in Team IMPACT, mentors child
ABBY SMITH
Staffwriter
When scanning the 
benches at Carnegie Mellon’s 
next home football game on 
Sept. 27, you may see a Tartan 
jersey just a bit smaller than 
the others.
This jersey belongs to 
Brock Kitterman, a 9-year-old 
boy proud to be the latest ad-
dition to the football team. 
Kitterman is different than the 
others on the ?eld for reasons 
besides his 4-foot-6 frame; Kit-
terman suffers from bilateral 
retinoblastoma, a very rare 
eye cancer. 
When he was just 12 weeks 
old, Kitterman underwent 
chemotherapy for six months 
to calcify the tumors. Though 
the tumors shrank, allowing 
his retinas to reattach, the 
treatment signi?cantly com-
promised his hearing. Brock 
is considered legally blind and 
deaf.
Kitterman became involved 
in the Carnegie Mellon foot-
ball program as part of Team 
IMPACT (Inpsire, Motivate, 
and Play Against Challenges 
Together), an organization 
that matches college sports 
teams with children battling 
chronic illnesses.
Kitterman’s past medical 
problems still have an effect 
on him today. Largely de-
prived of his sight and hear-
ing, Brock struggled socially, 
?nding it challening to pick up 
on social cues, even those as 
simple as a smile. His mother, 
Tammy Kitterman, noticed 
this problem and mentioned it 
to a doctor at Children’s Hos-
pital of Pittsburgh.
After a few weeks, the doc-
tor suggested joining Team 
IMPACT. Tammy signed Brock 
up for the program and he was 
matched up with the Tartans.
“When we ?rst heard 
Brock would be matched with 
the football team, we were 
extremely apprehensive,” 
Tammy Kitterman said, “but 
after meeting the guys, we all 
agreed it couldn’t have been a 
better team.”
Head Coach Rich Lackner 
was approached by Director of 
Athletics, Physical Education 
and Recreation Joshua Centor 
about “adopting” Brock, and 
was enthusiastic about the idea 
from the start.
“Brock is an honor and 
an opportunity to impact the 
football program at Carnegie 
Mellon,” Lackner said.
According to Tammy Kit-
terman Brock now attends 
several practices each week, 
prepares the locker room for 
games, and supports the Tar-
tans at every game. When the 
team is on the ?eld playing 
or practicing, the team man-
agers play a “crucial role” on 
the sidelines, keeping Brock 
involved and busy during the 
game.
Brock was unanimously 
voted captain for this fall 
season.
“Brock truly brings a 
unique perspective on life,” 
Lackner said. “When you look 
at the challenges he faces ev-
ery day, it makes your own 
problems seem insigni?cant.”
Senior mechanical en-
gineering and biomedical 
engineering double major 
Dustin Schneider said he is 
constantly inspired by Brock. 
“When you’re having a tough 
day or rough practice, it helps 
to think of Brock’s bravery,” 
Schneider said. “He’s just re-
ally fun to be around.”
Both Lackner and Schnei-
der commented that Brock has 
helped create an even stron-
ger team dynamic. “Brock 
serves as a daily reminder that 
we are incredibly blessed to 
be playing college football,” 
Schneider said. 
Although he cannot play 
football, instead cheering the 
Tartans on from the bleachers, 
Brock remains active in other 
sports. This past summer 
Brock completed a triathlon. 
A number of Carnegie Mellon 
football players went out to 
watch him compete.
“I am absolutely amazed at 
Brock on a daily basis,” Lack-
ner said. “He never stops push-
ing himself.”
After his ?rst-place ?nish 
in the triathlon, Brock was 
treated by the football players 
to a trip to Kennywood amuse-
ment park.
“It really showed how trust-
ing [Brock’s parents] were 
with our football players,” 
Lackner said. “After just meet-
ing the players weeks earlier, 
they felt con?dent their son 
was in good hands.”
Brock’s mother has seen 
Brock grow signi?cantly since 
the start of the program. 
She, as well as Coach Lack-
ner and the players, have all 
noticed remarkable improve-
ment in Brock’s social skills. 
“He has opened up a lot more 
and gained a lot of self-con-
?dence,” Tammy Kitterman 
said. “He really considers the 
football guys to be his closest 
friends.”
Carnegie Mellon’s basket-
ball team is currently in the 
process of “adopting” as well; 
their prospective adoptee is a 
5-year-old boy who has acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia. “Our 
hope and expectation is that 
he will be having such a great 
time with us that ... CMU bas-
ketball will be front and cen-
ter in his thoughts day in and 
day out, rather than his daily 
chemotherapy treatments or 
frequent hospital visits,” said 
junior business administration 
major and forward for Carn-
egie Mellon’s basketball team 
Kevin Stursberg. “The kid is a 
warrior!”

Carnegie Mellon’s An-
dreea Deciu Ritivoi recently 
published a new book, pub-
lished by Columbia Univer-
sity Press and titled Intimate 
Strangers in American Politi-
cal Discourse, which exam-
ines American politics from 
the eyes of foreigners.
The book looks at the ex-
periences of four well-known 
intellectuals — Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn, Herbert Mar-
cuse, Edward Said, and Han-
nah Arendt — who shared 
outsider status. 
Ritivoi, professor of Eng-
lish in the Dietrich College 
of Humanities and Social 
Sciences, noted in a press 
release, “Arendt, Marcuse, 
Solzhenitsyn, and Said had 
a love-hate relationship with 
American society but wanted 
to make it better.”
Her publication suggests 
that there were bene?ts to 
the criticism offered by ex-
iles, all of whom were at the 
helms of in?uential schools 
of thought in American poli-
tics following World War II.
As Ritivoi pointed out in 
the release, these individu-
als adopted a rhetoric of per-
suasion because they sought 
to establish themselves as 
“American enough,” and in 
doing so challenged nau-
tral born Americans to step 
back and examine problems 
rather than accept the status 
quo.
In researching and writ-
ing this book, Ritivoi was 
startled to discover that even 
highly educated people were 
reluctant to accept the politi-
cal views of outsiders, while 
almost too eagerly embracing 
the notion that only native-
born Americans truly know 
what is best for America.
Vladimir Tismaneanu, 
professor of politics at the 
University of Maryland re-
marked that Ritivoi’s new 
book “is not only a major 
achievement in intellectual 
history but also a vibrant in-
vitation to empathy, lucidity, 
and moral clarity.”

Alumnus Putney publishes WWI photo album
Inspired by history de-
partment adjunct professor 
Linda Benedict-Jones’ His-
tory of Photography class 
while a student at Carnegie 
Mellon, Dean Putney (DC 
’11) took what his mother 
assumed was simply a fam-
ily memento and turned it 
into a book and photography 
exhibit.
Putney’s great-grandfa-
ther was a German Army 
lieutenant during World 
War I who carried a camera 
with him as he served. Real-
izing that the photo album, 
which had been stashed in 
his grandmother’s closet for 
decades, had the potential 
to tell a remarkable story, 
Putney reproduced it into a 
book, Walter Koessler 1914–
1918: The personal photo 
journal of a German of?cer 
in World War I. Presently, a 
corresponding exhibit, “Pho-
tography in the Trenches, 
1914–1918,” can be seen at 
the Carnegie Museum of Art.
When Putney ?rst exam-
ined his great-grandfather’s 
photo album, he sought the 
expertise of Benedict-Jones, 
who advised and assisted 
him with his project. Bene-
dict-Jones was particularly 
pleased to see that an elective 
course for a student studying 
information systems had led 
to what she termed “a pas-
sionate project.”
Putney raised almost 
$115,000 through a Kick-
starter campaign, a number 
he partially attributes to 
World War I’s upcoming cen-
tennial. The book, consisting 
of nearly 670 photographs, is 
a stark view of the ups and 
downs of a soldier’s exis-
tence.
Adam Ryan, curatorial as-
sistant at the Carnegie Mu-
seum of Art, described the 
album as “remarkable” in a 
recent press release, saying 
that the book “includes for-
mal portraits of of?cers, but 
most are spontaneous snap-
shots.”

CARL DOERSCH
Special to The Tartan
In 2012, Facebook conduct-
ed a study to determine how 
the contents of users’ news 
feeds affect their behavior. In 
particular, they showed some 
users a more positive news 
feed and others a more nega-
tive news feed and showed 
that the users’ posts became 
more positive in the positive 
condition and more negative 
in the negative condition. 
When this study was pub-
lished in the Proceedings of the 
National Academy of Sciences 
of the United States of America 
earlier this year, it caused a 
major outcry among Facebook 
users. Thus, Pugwash sought 
to understand whether this 
experiment was ethical, and 
whether Facebook or the gov-
ernment should do something 
about it.
Members ?rst explored the 
consequences of an experi-
ment like this one. It was de-
termined that the Facebook 
users were affected in an ap-
parently minor way: Their 
emotions were altered to be 
somewhat more positive or 
negative. While people with 
depression might have done 
things to permanently harm 
themselves in the case of add-
ed negative emotions, by and 
large, this kind of emotional 
impact isn’t outside the scope 
of daily life. However, what’s 
more important is that this ex-
periment set a precedent that 
it is okay for a corporation like 
Facebook to perform experi-
ments on its users and publish 
the results.
It’s easy to imagine re-
search that Facebook might 
conduct — secretly or open-
ly — in its own best inter-
est that’s considerably more 
harmful; for instance, lying 
to users to see their behav-
ior. Should corporations be 
able to conduct this type of 
research on their own? And 
should public funds be allo-
cated to research that is as-
sociated with such corporate 
experimentation?
The public funding ques-
tion is somewhat easier to an-
swer, since there are already 
established ethical guidelines 
from the famous Belmont 
Report which stipulates the 
conditions under which the 
government can fund human 
subjects research. To a certain 
extent, the public’s trust of 
scienti?c experimentation is 
already founded on this docu-
ment, and therefore, it makes 
sense to hold it as sacred, un-
less something is found to be 
seriously wrong with it.
For an experiment like this 
one — which involves actually 
manipulating a human being 
— the Belmont Report requires 
‘informed consent’: that the 
user should know that he or 
she will undergo experimen-
tation, and that he or she can 
opt out if desired. In this case, 
the researchers almost had 
informed consent, since Face-
book’s terms of service do say 
that users agree to participate 
in research.
However, the terms of ser-
vice also say that the research 
will only be used internally. 
Furthermore, the vast major-
ity of Facebook users don’t 
read the terms of service. In 
the Belmont Report, it’s the 
researcher’s responsibility 
to make sure the participant 
understands the consent; a 
statement buried in a huge 
document that the participant 
signs is not enough. In this 
sense, Facebook and these re-
searchers likely overstepped 
their bounds. However, the 
majority opinion in Pugwash 
seemed to be that the infrac-
tion was minor, especially 
since the government did not 
do very much to fund this re-
search (the actual experiment 
was funded by Facebook).
Whether Facebook and 
other Internet giants should 
be allowed to carry out such 
research is another matter. 
This kind of experimentation 
is largely unprecedented in 
corporate circles.
Fifty years ago, corpora-
tions had no way to precisely 
monitor users’ interactions 
with their products, so they 
had little to gain by altering 
the experience for some us-
ers. Of course, companies 
did experiment with human 
subjects — for instance, the 
drug industry couldn’t exist 
without human drug trials 
— but for those experiments 
there was never any ambigu-
ity about whether a given per-
son was participating. For the 
drug industry, these trials are 
heavily regulated. However, 
these laws don’t apply to In-
ternet-based research.
For Internet experimenta-
tion, the prevailing interpre-
tation of the law seems to be 
that Facebook owns the feed, 
it is their product, and so it’s 
up to them what they put in 
it. The assumption here is 
that text and images are not 
dangerous or unpredictable, 
at least not to the extent that 
untested drugs are. If people 
feel Facebook is degrading 
their experience, they can just 
leave.
Thus, it can be argued that 
it’s in Facebook’s best inter-
est not to do things that may 
harm or anger their users. But 
is this really true?
For an experiment like this 
one, it wasn’t clear whether 
the negativity came from 
Facebook or from the users’

HOW THINGS WORK
Migraines not just 
severe headaches
CLAIRE GIANAKAS
Staffwriter
Migraines and other types 
of severe headaches have 
baf?ed the medical commu-
nity for thousands of years. 
As medical knowledge of mi-
graines increased, treatments 
also improved, advancing 
from trepanation — the drill-
ing of holes into the skull — 
to modern preventive medi-
cations and lifestyle changes.
Today, migraines are de-
?ned as neurological disor-
ders characterized by severe 
head pain and other nervous 
system symptoms such as loss 
of vision, nausea, and numb-
ness. Although migraines 
are often described as severe 
headaches, the two condi-
tions are actually separate 
disorders.
Migraines are gener-
ally caused by the dilation 
of blood vessels, while head-
aches involve the constriction 
of blood vessels. Headache 
symptoms are generally re-
stricted to head pain, where-
as migraines often include a 
variety of symptoms. In ad-
dition to severe head pain, 
migraines can be character-
ized by an aura (lines, bright 
light, patterns, or blind spots 
that inhibit vision), eupho-
ria, hallucinations, nausea, 
weakness, numbness, and 
cognitive problems such 
as dif?culty speaking or 
hearing.
The speci?c neurological 
cause of migraines is still un-
known. Migraines are initi-
ated by a trigger, which can 
be a variety of simple events, 
such as a change in routine 
or hormones, as well as en-
vironmental factors like loud 
noises, bright lights, and high 
heights.
Originally, doctors be-
lieved that migraines con-
sisted solely of the dilation 
of blood vessels in the brain 
after the initial trigger. 
Today, however, it is be-
lieved that migraines are ac-
tually composed of several 
distinct, sequential events in 
the brain.
After the initial trigger, 
nociceptors, cells that sense 
pain, identify the trigger 
and release neuropeptides, 
compounds involved in the 
transmission of signals in 
the nervous system. These 
compounds bind to other 
nociceptors in the surround-
ing area and cause them to 
be more sensitive to pain 
and, therefore, release more 
neuropeptides. 
The released neuropep-
tides induce a variety of 
changes within the brain. 
Namely, they affect the mus-
cles around the blood vessels 
on the surface of the brain 
and cause the muscles to re-
lax. This relaxation causes 
the blood vessels to dilate. 
They also cause cranial ves-
sels to leak, which results in 
swelling of the brain tissue. 
Together, increased pain 
sensitivity, brain tissue swell-
ing, and blood vessel dilation 
cause migraines.
Doctors today are also 
aware of several risk fac-
tors for migraines includ-
ing gender, age, and family 
history. Women are more at 
risk than men for migraines. 
According to the University 
of Maryland Medical Center, 
approximately 75 percent 
of all migraine sufferers are 
women. Migraines are also 
more common in people be-
tween the ages of 15 and 55. 
Furthermore, migraines run 
in families. About 70 percent 
of migraine patients have a 
history of migraines in their 
family.
Migraines, like many 
other illnesses, come in a 
variety of different forms. 
The three most common 
forms of migraines are called 
classic migraines, common 
migraines, and ocular mi-
graines. A classic migraine 
is a migraine with head pain 
and an aura. Migraines with-
out an aura are called com-
mon migraines, and can be 
characterized by euphoria 
or cognitive problems along 
with severe head pain. Ocu-
lar migraines are migraines 
that have an aura, but lack 
head pain. Abdominal mi-
graines also occur; they lack 
head pain and an aura, but 
still involve the symptoms 
of a migraine (such as in-
creased sense perception and 
nausea). 
People are classi?ed as 
having chronic migraines if 
they have more than 15 mi-
graines a month.
Migraine treatment can be 
either acute, after migraine 
onset, or preventive, before 
migraine onset. Acute treat-
ment often includes house-
hold drugs such as Tylenol 
and Advil (ibuprofen). 
Although this type of 
treatment is generally taken 
after symptoms start, it is 
most effective if taken before 
head pain begins. This is par-
ticularly effective for people 
who experience an aura be-
fore the onset of head pain. 
Acute treatment can also in-
volve triptans, a medication 
that mimics serotonin, which 
is a chemical that regulates 
mood.
Preventive treatment 
is common for people di-
agnosed with chronic mi-
graines. This type of treat-
ment usually involves 
various medications or life-
style changes. Antidepres-
sants, which alter serotonin 
levels, have been shown to 
be effective in preventing mi-
graines. Various cardiovas-
cular medications and anti-
seizure medications have 
also been shown to prevent 
migraines. 
Lifestyle changes that lim-
it the amount of variation in a 
person’s daily life can also be 
effective.
Despite substantial devel-
opments in the understand-
ing and treatment of mi-
graines, there are still many 
unanswered questions that 
could lead to more effective 
diagnosis and treatment of 
migraines.

Cook designing long-term arti?cial lungs
ADITHYA VENKATESAN
Junior Staffwriter
The production of use-
ful arti?cial organs has long 
been a goal in the ?eld of 
medical science, but it has 
not been achieved due to 
many restraints with current 
technology. 
Keith Cook, an associate 
professor of biomedical engi-
neering, recently received a 
four-year, $2.4 million grant 
from the National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) to study new 
technologies to develop arti?-
cial lungs that can be used for 
months at a time.
“Millions of people suffer 
from chronic lung disease,” 
Cook said. Unfortunately, 
there is a disparity between 
the number of people who 
need lung transplants and the 
number of lung donors. 
Additionally, patients are 
currently required to stay at 
the hospital to receive proper 
support. In this kind of situa-
tion, patients also need to ?nd 
a donor quickly, or they risk 
further harm, and possibly 
death. This stark difference 
between supply and demand 
drives a very real need for ar-
ti?cial lungs.
In his research, Cook looks 
at patients that ultimately 
might not receive lung trans-
plants, as well as those who 
are too sick to get transplants 
and need some stabilization in 
order to receive them.
Cook’s planned arti?cial 
lung would help alleviate 
these problems by allow-
ing those patients to rely on 
a device that would not clot 
for over three months, which 
could have applications for 
not only arti?cial lung de-
vices but any device that uses 
blood. 
In addition, he hopes to 
integrate these devices into 
patients’ homes, which would 
allow patients to avoid spend-
ing their time in a hospital 
ward while still receiving all 
the care they require. Patients 
would have little work, while 
the physicians or biomedical 
engineers could monitor the 
patient and intercede when 
the device nears failure. Cook 
estimated that the lungs could 
be used in hospitals in ?ve to 
10 years.
There are some working 
arti?cial lungs available now, 
but they prove useful for a 
month at most. One method 
currently used in hospitals 
involves extracorporeal mem-
brane oxygenation (ECMO). 
In this process, a machine 
functions as an arti?cial lung 
by infusing oxygen into the 
blood, removing carbon diox-
ide, and returning the blood 
to the patient. However, this 
process is expensive and in-
tensive. In order for the stan-
dard gas exchange to occur, 
a polypropylene membrane is 
used. The walls of the ?bers 
are porous, allowing blood 
plasma to leak into the gas 
side or bubbles from the gas 
side to leak into the blood 
stream. Plasma leakage can 
destroy the gas exchange 
function of the lung, and air 
leakage can cause death in the 
patient.
A solid ?ber such as 
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
eliminates plasma and gas 
leakage. However, the long-
term function of these ?bers 
is unknown. Because both of 
these materials provide ad-
vantages and problems that 
need to be overcome, Cook is 
currently working with both 
types to try to create a mem-
brane that could last longer. 
For example, coating the poly-
propylene with PDMS may 
prove useful. However, nei-
ther of the methods are cur-
rently ready.
In a human body, endothe-
lial cells keep the blood from 
coagulating. However, other 
materials run into many prob-
lems due to the lack of vascu-
lar endothelial cell linings in 
foreign materials. 
Although researchers have 
been attempting to create en-
dothelial linings, it has been 
extremely dif?cult to do so. 
As a result, “people control 
or learn to live with it,” Cook 
said.
He explained that people 
largely deal with anticoagu-
lants, which are drugs that 
slow down the blood clotting 
process, although this creates 
concerns such as making sure 
the patient doesn’t bleed more 
than usual. Because the endo-
thelial cells have many com-
plex properties, Cook is trying 
to mimic these properties one 
at a time. Cook believes that 
mimicking their properties 
may lead to better materials 
for the arti?cial lungs, and 
eliminate the challenge inher-
ent in working with endothe-
lial cells themselves.
As more work is done on 
the arti?cial lungs, Cook be-
lieves it will become a viable 
device for people with chronic 
lung disease and other lung 
problems. With Cook’s de-
signs for the device, he hopes 
to increase the longevity of 
the device by decreasing co-
agulation on the foreign mate-
rials and using materials that 
would allow for successful 
lung function.

White House to ?ght antibiotic resistance
Though the problem of an-
tibiotic resistance has troubled 
hospitals and communities 
for decades, new genome-
sequencing technologies that 
inspect bacterial genomes can 
be used to sketch out a molec-
ular family tree, which could 
provide researchers with more 
data regarding antibiotic re-
sistance. To support genome-
sequencing technology and 
develop a new national strat-
egy to ?ght resistant bacte-
ria, President Barack Obama 
signed an executive order on 
Sept. 18 recognizing antibi-
otic resistance and creating a 
task force to combat the issue. 
The order came as a response 
to a report released on the 
same day by the President’s 
Council of Advisors on Sci-
ence and Technology encour-
aging further research on this 
topic. The White House also 
announced a $20 million prize 
for the development of rapid 
tests that can identify antibiot-
ic-resistant infections.

Single dose of antidepressant changes the brain
SSRIs (selective serotonin 
re-uptake inhibitors) are one 
of the most common kinds of 
antidepressants prescribed. 
However, it is unclear what 
the exact effect of the drug is 
on the brain. A recent study 
conducted by Julia Sacher of 
the Max Plank Institute for 
Human Cognitive and Brain 
Sciences suggests that a single 
dose of antidepressant not 
only dramatically changes 
brain connectivity but also 
does so in a matter of hours.
In the study, participants 
were monitored in a brain 
scanner as they were allowed 
to let their mind wander for 
about 15 minutes and then 
monitored again after taking 
a single dose of escitalopram, 
better known as Lexapro. 
By comparing 3-D images of 
connections occurring in the 
participants’ brains, the re-
searchers found that one dose 
of Lexapro reduces the level 
of connectivity in most of the 
brain.

Theory of relativity applicable to superheavy elements
Researchers have recently 
created the ?rst chemical 
compound whose behavior 
can only be explained with 
Einstein’s theory of relativity. 
Researchers at the GSI Helm-
holtz Centre for Heavy Ion 
Research in Germany have 
combined the 106th element 
of the periodic table, seabor-
gium, with six carbon mon-
oxide molecules. Although 
other superheavy elements 
have never exhibited relativ-
istic behavior before, this one 
seems different. As the team 
measured its volatility and re-
activity, the values were simi-
lar to those for compounds of 
molybdenum and tungsten — 
which are in the same group as 
seaborgium in the periodic ta-
ble — with carbon monoxide. 
This behavior can agree with 
the theoretical model only if 
Einstein’s theory of relativity 
is taken into account. The re-
searchers plan to perform fur-
ther tests on heavier elements 
to test such relativistic effects.

New materials used for computer processors
A recent processor de-
signed by researchers from 
several universities around 
the world uses phase change 
materials (PCMs), which may 
be able to change computers 
in the future. The calculations 
performed by most electronics 
today are carried out by sili-
con-based logic devices. How-
ever, PCMs have the advan-
tage of being able to reversibly 
switch between two electrical 
states in mere billionths of a 
second. These materials have 
the potential to make the pro-
cessing speed of future com-
puters 1,000 times faster than 
they are now.
PCMs were ?rst developed 
in the 1960s and were used 
in optical-memory devices. 
But now, they have begun to 
take the place of traditional 
silicon-based memory in some 
smartphones. As it turns out, 
PCMs-based processors use 
less energy, making them not 
only faster but also more envi-
ronmentally friendly.

Study reveals effect of arti?cial sweeteners on body
Researchers have found 
that arti?cial sweeteners may 
disrupt the body’s blood sugar 
regulation, thus causing meta-
bolic changes that can lead to 
diabetes. Even though previ-
ous studies on the effects of 
arti?cial sweeteners have had 
con?icting conclusions, this 
report has earned many posi-
tive responses from scientists. 
The researchers performed 
experiments on mice to back 
up their assertion that the 
sweeteners change the popu-
lation of bacteria in the diges-
tive system.
A control-group experi-
ment found that there was 
little change in the mice that 
drank water or sugar water 
while mice that received arti-
?cial sweeteners developed a 
clear intolerance to glucose. 
However, at present the scien-
tists still cannot explain how 
the sweeteners affect the bac-
teria and what exactly results 
in the changes from the glu-
cose metabolism.

World population to reach 11 billion by mid-century
Most estimates in the past 
20 years predicted that the hu-
man population would grow 
to around 10 billion by mid-
century, a number that now 
seems to be an underestimate. 
It was previously assumed 
that the decline in birth rate 
in Africa is occurring at the 
same pace as declines in other 
regions (for example, Asia). 
However, it turns out the rate 
of fertility decline has slowed 
(and even reversed) in some 
African countries in the last 15 
years. 
At current rates, scientists 
believe Africa will likely be-
come as densely populated 
as today’s China. As Hans 
Rosling, an international 
health researcher at the Karo-
linska Institute in Stockholm, 
expects, the world should 
prepare for at least 11 billion 
people by mid-century.

American singer-songwrit-
er Moby visited Kresge The-
atre while passing through 
Pittsburgh to perform a DJ 
set at the 2nd annual Thrival 
music festival on Sept. 14. 
However, instead of playing 
his popular electronic music, 
the singer-songwriter and DJ 
spoke about his experience 
with music as therapy.
Moby said that, as a young 
musician, he fought to ?nd 
purpose with his work. He 
knew that he loved to create 
music and was happy with his 
career, but there was always 
an underlying feeling that it 
was not substantial enough. 
This all changed when Moby 
discovered the Institute for 
Music and Neurological Func-
tioning (IMNF), a non-pro?t 
organization that is part of the 
CenterLight Health System. 
The New York-based company 
is dedicated to studying and 
developing effective musical 
treatment for neurological 
damage and disorder. IMNF 
was founded in 1995 by Dr. 
Concetta Tomaino with help 
from therapist Oliver Sacks. 
The IMNF is a worldwide 
leader in the research of mu-
sic-based therapy.
Neurogenesis is the natural 
process through which stem 
cells generate new neurons. 
A healthy, active lifestyle is 
known to be conducive to neu-
rogenesis, but Tomaino and 
Sacks found that music is ac-
tually one of the most effective 
stimulants of neurogenesis.
During his lecture, Moby 
recalled instances of Tomai-
no’s and Sacks’s research that 
revealed just how effective 
music therapy could be. 
For example, he explained 
that he witnessed a mute 
woman sing and a crippled 
man tap his feet when one 
of their favorite songs were 
playing. 
Playing music has also 
proved to be extraordinarily 
bene?cial in reducing stress 
and increasing endorphin 
output. 
Current research projects 
of the IMNF include seeing if 
music therapy improves the 
health of those in home care 
and reduces emergency room 
trips and how making music 
can treat depression.
Moby pointed out that the 
only way for music therapy to 
be effective is for the patient 
to have emotional ties to the 
music. 
Listening to music that is 
meaningless does not stimu-
late one’s brain. However, it 
is not dif?cult to create emo-
tional ties to music. 
Whether it brings tears to 
your eyes or reminds you of 
that amazing summer three 
years ago, music prompts pro-
found emotions.
“Imagine a wedding with 
no music, or a funeral with no 
music,” Moby said. 
It is natural for people to 
tie music to a variety of emo-
tional situations.
Moby takes this to heart in 
the creation of his own music. 
He said he strives to create 
music that elicits emotions 
within himself with the hopes 
that others have similar reac-
tions. Moby urges people to 
use music as therapy in their 
own lives, as it has proven to 
be a cheap and effective way 
to stimulate neurogenesis and 
reduce stress hormones. As it 
turns out, listening to and cre-
ating music is just another as-
pect of maintaining a healthy 
lifestyle.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Mainstream media seems to have 
a pretty good idea of what consti-
tutes a “good role model” and who 
?ts the bill. Case in point: The Inter-
net went into uproar last week when 
rap superstar Nicki Minaj tweeted 
indignantly about Fiorello H. La-
Guardia Arts High School’s refusal 
to let her return to “the school that 
changed [her] life” and “inspire” 
students. Since Minaj and I share 
an alma mater, needless to say I was 
shocked to hear that the new princi-
pal Lisa Mars declined the visitation 
offer of one of our school’s all-time 
most successful graduates. 
Speculation ?ew wildly about 
the reasoning behind the snub, and 
I’ll admit that I bought into Minaj’s 
insinuation that it was because the 
principal didn’t consider her “good 
enough.” In terms of music video 
views or albums sold, no doubt 
Minaj’s celebrity suf?ced; but as a 
“role model,” LaGuardia’s principal 
would surely be neither the ?rst nor 
last to believe Nicki Minaj not good 
enough.
In later reports, the principal de-
fended herself, claiming that it was 
the New York Department of Educa-
tion’s objections, and not her own, 
which barred Minaj from LaGuar-
dia’s doors. Minaj wanted to bring 
MTV cameras onto New York City 
public school grounds with about a 
week’s notice, and couldn’t compro-
mise her busy schedule for a date 
more acceptable to the bureaucracy. 
In a nuanced light, Minaj’s righteous 
anger seems a bit overplayed. Nev-
ertheless, this apparent misunder-
standing of a scandal provides a con-
venient platform to talk about the 
anatomy of the female role model.
There are many reasons one 
might have for not wanting their 
daughter or little sister to look up to 
Nicki Minaj. Nine out of 10 of these 
reasons probably have to do with 
her notoriously shameless expres-
sion of sexuality. Minaj is known 
for her killer curves as much as she 
is for her killer verses, neither of 
which she is afraid to ?aunt. Her 
chart-topping summer single “Ana-
conda,” which has amassed over 184 
million plays on YouTube, features a  
rhythmic chorus and Minaj as the 
unchallenged twerking master; 
it’s dif?cult to say which is more 
mesmerizing.
The same folks shaking their 
heads at Minaj for such a lascivious 
display will surely fail to consider 
the music video’s scene where she 
gleefully chops up a banana and 
then sneers at the phallic remains. 
They will also likely not acknowl-
edge the fact that the one time a 
man is present in the video, he is 
overwhelmed by Minaj’s seductive 
powers, and when he tries to touch 
her without her consent, she imme-
diately shoves him away and struts 
off the screen, abandoning him with 
head in hands. Minaj’s sexiness is 
self-aware and unashamed, and ev-
erything she allows us to see is en-
tirely within her control.
Society has a way of demonizing 
women — and especially female ce-
lebrities — who own their sexuality 
like Minaj does. To be sexy is to be 
“slutty,” and to be slutty is to be mor-
ally decrepit and corrupting. The 
only way women’s sexuality may 
be halfway acceptable is when it is 
tempered by the presence of a man, 
whether he is rapping about his 
“big booty hoes” or grabbing at the  
scantily-clad bodies of the anony-
mous women surrounding him. 
When a woman like Minaj — or Mi-
ley Cyrus, or Kesha, or even Beyon-
cé — dares to be sexual, indepen-
dent of a man’s in?uence, society is 
thrown through a loop and quick to 
enact brutal judgment.
Maybe my high school’s refusal 
of Nicki Minaj had nothing to do 
with the lurid reputation society 
has given her. Still, there is no bet-
ter time than now to speak up in 
defense of women like Minaj, who 
embrace their sexuality and who are 
role models despite and because of 
that. It might be worth noting that 
Minaj, Cyrus, Kesha, and Beyoncé 
have all self-identi?ed as feminists, 
while such “good girl” celebrities as 
Shailene Woodley and Katy Perry 
have swerved away from the label as 
if dodging an oncoming truck. 
Minaj is a talented artist who 
revolutionized rap music. She is 
a driven businesswoman who has 
built, grown, and maintained an im-
mensely successful career, noting 
that the same qualities that make 
her a “bitch” would make a “boss” 
out of a man. And, yes, Nicki Minaj 
is sexy. I am proud to call her a role 
model of mine.

Sexual assault focus groups show pointed action 
On Sept. 12, Dean of Student Af-
fairs Gina Casalegno sent a campus-
wide email drawing attention to 
further institutional efforts against 
sexual assault and sexual harass-
ment following the policy approved 
in April 2013. As part of the update, 
Casalegno announced curricula revi-
sions, enhanced trainings, increased 
staf?ng, and a mandatory online 
training program for incoming un-
dergraduates called Haven.
As a campus, we have yet to see 
how implementation of these mea-
sures will affect campus culture, but 
a number of them show promise in 
changing conversations about sexual 
violence on campus.
Among the efforts Casalegno 
highlighted is the establishment of 
focus groups to facilitate the dia-
logue. It may seem like a trivial mea-
sure, but these focus groups go a step 
beyond the reactive, largely ineffec-
tive town-hall-style discussions we 
have seen from the administration in 
the past. The focus groups take a pro-
active approach by targeting speci?c 
groups in the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity, including athletes, members 
of Greek life, and LGBTQ students.
Attendance at the focus group 
session on Wednesday, for example, 
is reserved for members of student 
government and leaders of student 
organizations. According to a Sept. 
17 email update from the Bridge, 
“[Leaders across campus] have a tre-
mendous amount of in?uence over 
the health of campus community 
and also have a unique perspective 
on how sexual harassment and sex-
ual violence affects our community.”
By intentionally reaching out 
to community members who carry 
in?uence in the discussion, the uni-
versity shows that this measure is 
not simply a knee-jerk reaction to a 
community spotlight on a dif?cult 
issue. Instead, the administration’s 
efforts are purposeful and strategic 
in directly addressing as many com-
munity members as possible.
When a policy change occurs on 
campus, an easy criticism to make 
is that new programs will likely fall 
short of instituting change. The 
policy, the new programs, and their 
timing are not perfect, but if proper 
advantage is taken of these focus 
groups, then community members 
and leaders can take initiative in 
shifting the dialogue.

Last week, Scotland put practi-
cal concerns over national pride and 
voted to remain part of the United 
Kingdom. 
Fifty-?ve percent of Scottish vot-
ers opted to remain part of the UK af-
ter with an 85 percent voter turnout, 
Scottish voters made the wise choice 
of electing to remain part of a mutu-
ally bene?cial political and economic 
union. 
The desire for Scottish indepen-
dence is more than understandable; 
Scots have a culture, accent, and his-
tory that is distinct from England. 
The Scottish parliament has also 
pursued a much more liberal agenda 
than the English parliament; has not 
taken the austerity measures the rest 
of the United Kingdom has; and still 
offers free university tuition to all 
students. 
Many Scots also rallied behind 
the ideas of removing British nuclear  
submarines from bases on the Scot-
tish coast and less involvement in un-
popular military action in the Middle 
East.
These compelling political and 
social motivations moved 45 per-
cent of voters to support separation, 
but they did not trump economic 
concerns. 
On average, Scotland has a lower 
life expectancy, and its signi?cantly 
higher than average weekly pay for  
full-time workers is dependent on  oil 
and gas revenues, according to the 
BBC (which has been accused of bias 
by many independence supporters. 
Scotland has numerous health and 
social burdens, which would place 
a great deal of stress on the ?nanc-
es of a social democracy, the likely 
model to be adopted by an indepen-
dent Scottish state. Scotland would 
have dif?culty facing these problems 
without the  ?nancial support of the  
United Kingdom’s economy and ?-
nancial institutions.
While Scotland’s oil provides a 
potentially major source of revenue 
for a newly independent nation, reli-
ance on a single source of fossil fuels 
is not a ?nancially sound or sustain-
able solution. Betting a nation’s reve-
nue stream on a single commodity is 
a dangerous move, especially in the 
current climate of growing calls for 
the reduction of fossil fuel use and 
backlash against their impact. 
On top of these concerns, the 
Royal Bank of Scotland decided that, 
were Scotland to seek independence, 
they would relocate their headquar-
ters to England. This move would be 
a devastating blow to the Scottish 
?nancial sector and would under-
score doubts regarding Scotland’s 
independent economic strength. Un-
certainty about Scotland’s ability to 
function as a fully independent eco-
nomic state would undoubtedly have 
made relationships with European 
Union states dif?cult, in particular 
given the increasing push for alter-
native and renewable energy sources 
by these nations. 
A Scottish state whose economic 
strength relied on the sale of fossil 
fuels would be supported somewhat 
hypocritically by those with serious 
ethical reservations about oil and by 
those committed to environmental 
improvement.
Scotland’s desire for indepen-
dence is understandable, but ulti-
mately impractical. However, Prime 
Minister Gordon Brown has pledged 
to work with those parties support-
ing separation to better address 
Scotland’s needs, although it has yet 
to be seen if the promised further de-
volution of powers to Edinburgh will 
occur. 
This vote may have wound up get-
ting Scots more of what they want 
without sacri?cing what they al-
ready have. Scotland has made the 
well-reasoned choice of staying part 
of the UK, valuing economic stability 
over cultural pride.

A PERSON’S OPINION

The Tartan pulled on a sweater and bought a pumpkin spice latte this week. So we asked,
What’s your favorite thing about the fall weather?

On Sept. 15, the Tartan Board 
published an editorial entitled “PA 
environmental issues need CMU at-
tention” that calls on the university 
to focus its attention on local envi-
ronmental issues, especially the im-
pacts of shale gas development. The 
editorial implies that the univer-
sity does not conduct such research 
already.
Had your editorial board asked 
Carnegie Mellon’s Scott Institute on 
Energy Innovation leadership about 
what research was taking place at 
Carnegie Mellon on this topic, we 
would have been pleased to report 
that Carnegie Mellon has extensive 
research activity on the issue of 
shale and the environment in West-
ern Pennsylvania. Much of Carnegie 
Mellon’s work is summarized in a 
Scott Institute policymaker guide 
entitled: “Shale Gas and the Envi-
ronment: Critical Need for a Govern-
ment-University-Industry Research 
Initiative.” 
Some of this research described 
in the guide has led to action, in-
cluding a major change in Penn-
sylvania policy on the handling of 
wastewater from shale gas develop-
ment activities.
In addition, Carnegie Mellon 
faculty chair major national and re-
gional advisory committees, teach 
courses, and provide testimony at 
congressional and regional federal 
agency hearings focused on shale 
and the environment. The Scott 
Institute also hosts public events 
discussing shale gas development 
issues in this region. And, just this 
week, we authored an article in The 
Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper, that 
highlights the importance of region-
ally-focused research on shale gas 
development.
Should the editors ask, the Scott 
Institute would be more than happy 
to assist them in identifying subject 
matter for an article on the subject 
of shale gas in Pennsylvania.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Imagine not having to leave your 
room to attend class. Instead, your 
morning routine consists of climb-
ing out of bed and turning on your 
MacBook. Video feeds of the profes-
sor and eight other students appear. 
After introductions, your professor 
asks a question about the reading.
 Instead of waiting for a student 
to raise their hand, the professor 
asks each of you to complete a poll 
that will test your understanding of 
the assigned reading. Your answers 
are then displayed so that you can 
be called on to defend them. In this 
situation, you do not have a choice in 
answering, and, more importantly, 
you are kept on your toes. This is an 
example of a class at the Minerva 
Project.
Minerva is an accredited univer-
sity with administrative of?ces and 
a dorm in San Francisco. According 
to Ben Nelson, its entrepreneur and 
founder, and Stephen M. Kosslyn, 
the cognitive neuroscientist and 
former Harvard dean with whom 
Nelson has collaborated, this class 
setting is the future of higher edu-
cation. Their goal is to replace the 
long-established college lecture 
with a virtual system of learning. 
What does this mean to the stu-
dents currently attending college 
and sitting through lectures?
Kosslyn states that traditional 
lectures are cost-effective but peda-
gogically unsound. According to 
him, Minerva has an advantage over 
traditional universities in its incor-
poration of what his research has 
identi?ed as the best educational 
practices. 
He claims that forcing students to 
guess the answer to a problem and to 
discuss their thoughts with others, 
enables them to learn more, even if 
their guesses are incorrect.
Many of the points Nelson and 
Kosslyn make are true. There are 
such things as pointless lectures. 
Lectures become pointless when 
students choose not to participate 
and refuse to actually learn. Large 
university lectures are opportunities 
either for students to hide in the back 
and not participate or to actively 
learn from a professor who is an ex-
pert in the lecture’s subject.
However, Nelson and Kosslyn do 
not seriously consider the sacri?ces 
that need to be made in order for 
traditional universities to follow Mi-
nerva’s example. Nelson claims that 
Minerva is an attempt to strip the 
traditional university down to its es-
sence without lectures or tenure, just 
learning.
What about life outside of the lec-
ture hall? College is about learning 
from the experts, but also learning 
about oneself. More often than not, 
we learn about ourselves through the 
people we meet and the places we 
go. Minerva is attempting to increase 
the value of its college experience by 
opening up more campuses around 
the world. This will de?nitely be a 
plus to all of those attending Miner-
va. However, there is still a distance 
between students and faculty inher-
ent to Minerva’s online platform.
There is a critical social aspect to 
college that is lost as a result of edu-
cation models like Minerva. There 
is something about letting students 
participate in on-campus organiza-
tions that brings people and ideas 
together. Look around Carnegie Mel-
lon’s campus. As I write this, there 
are countless students communicat-
ing and collaborating to make a dif-
ference in their communities. The 
accessibility of professors encourag-
es students to seek help when need-
ed. However, if professors were only 
available through Skype, the easily 
accessible relationship between stu-
dent and instructor would decline. 
It is the daily interactions students 
have both in and outside of class that 
let us truly value the college experi-
ence.
Minerva is a great example of 
how education could be improved. 
There is a de?nite bene?t to ap-
plying pressure to students to par-
ticipate in small groups. Minerva’s 
online platform does keep students 
attentive and forces them to learn. 
However, a lot of learning is up to 
the student. 
Minerva strips away not only the 
college experience of lectures but 
also the opportunity to communi-
cate and ?nd one’s passions through 
social interactions. Activities fairs, 
where students proudly display what 
they have been doing outside of the 
class to make a difference and en-
courage others to share their ideas, 
are a great example of what the 
college experience is comprised of. 
If these interactions were not avail-
able, the concept of the college expe-
rience would decline.
Online learning not education’s future

Thinking about buying one of 
those shiny new iPhone 6s or iPhone 
6 Pluses? Don’t hesitate much lon-
ger — they’re that worth it.
Apple launched its next genera-
tion iPhones (yes, two new models) 
on Sept. 19, opening its Shadyside 
location at 8 a.m. to an enormous 
crowd around its front doors.
As the owner of an iPhone 6 Plus, 
I can safely say that the new phones 
are bigger, better, and true work-
horses compared to the iPhone’s ear-
lier high-end model, the iPhone 5S.
I’ll spend most of this review talk-
ing about screen real estate because, 
let’s be real, that’s the biggest hard-
ware change for the latest models.
Put simply, the screens are gigan-
tic. If you can’t stand big phones, 
don’t even consider the Plus mod-
el. The smaller iPhone 6 touts a 
4.7-inch screen, while the larger 
iPhone 6 Plus is ?tted with a 5.5-
inch screen. When put in terms of a 
phone screen, that’s a lot of new real 
estate, and space that Apple uses to 
its advantage well.
While I was only able to test the 
iPhone 6 for a few minutes on launch 
day, I’ve been using the iPhone 6 
Plus for a few days now. The Plus has 
an option to turn the home screen 
sideways, and certain Apple-native 
apps offer more functionality in this 
orientation. Although nothing new 
is revealed by turning the phone 
sideways on the home screen, there 
are new options in other apps, like 
the ability to see all your emails or 
iMessages in a list next to the one 
you have selected.
When you double tap the home 
screen, you also see a list of recent 
contacts above the apps you have 
running at the moment, and the 
company has instituted one of its 
simplest, yet most intuitive fea-
tures, “reachability”, to account 
for the screen space. Tap, but don’t 
press, the iPhone’s Touch ID sen-
sor to bring the stuff at the top of 
your screen down to thumb’s reach 
if you’re using the phone with one 
hand. This feature makes using such 
a big screen effortless.
Besides maybe not being able to 
?t the new phones in your pocket, 
you won’t have any trouble actually 
using the larger screens. The phones’ 
new rounded edges and thinness 
also make the models easy to slide 
in and out of larger pockets. Going 
back to my iPhone 5’s screen after 
using the new big screen made me 
wonder why I didn’t switch to a big-
ger phone before this Apple launch.
All that said, these phones should 
have come out years ago when 
Google and Samsung released their 
?rst big-screen Galaxy phones. It’s 
nice to have Apple software running 
on a bigger screen that’s not as big as 
the iPad Air or Mini, but Apple had 
no excuse not to churn these phones 
out instead of the iPhone 5 or 5S 
when they were released, beyond 
not wanting to deal with the pain of 
switching up app sizes. 
Despite this gripe, the phones 
feel better in the hand and, on my 
?rst day of heavy use, I only drained 
the battery of the Plus to 40 percent. 
And, of course, there’s iOS8, which 
comes with its own slew of fun fea-
tures, like the ability to send voice 
clips over text, download third-par-
ty keyboards (hello, SwiftKey), and 
track your health with HealthKit.
For those enamored by Apple’s 
ecosystem, now’s the time to buy.

touchdown and then led 
21–7. Carnegie Mellon, 
boosted by a great return into 
Washington & Jefferson ter-
ritory by ?rst-year running 
back Sam Benger, was able to 
mount a response, culminat-
ing with a quarterback sneak 
by Hearon to ?nally punch it 
into the end zone and cut the 
de?cit to seven.
Any momentum the Tar-
tans had gained was quickly 
squashed in the next two 
drives, a long touchdown 
drive by the Presidents and 
an interception by Hearon in 
the red zone. The combina-
tion of stout defense and poor 
?eld position for Washington 
& Jefferson ended the scoring 
for the half, leaving the Tar-
tans down 28–14.
The third quarter started 
similarly to how the second 
ended with the teams trad-
ing three-and-outs. Carnegie 
Mellon was starting to string 
together a drive when Hearon 
fumbled the ball. 
The Presidents quickly 
scored another touchdown 
to push the lead to 21, fur-
ther burying the Tartans. 
While the game would not 
be of?cially over for another 
quarter, Washington & Jef-
ferson eliminated any doubt 
about the contest’s victor with 
yet another touchdown near 
the end of the third quarter, 
pushing the lead to an insur-
mountable 28.
With pride on the line, 
Carnegie Mellon responded, 
if only to minimize the dam-
age on the scoreboard. A drive 
spanning the end of the third 
quarter and start of the fourth 
culminated in a touchdown 
from Hearon to junior wide 
receiver Max Reinertsen, with 
the resulting onside kick re-
covery by ?rst-year offensive 
linebacker Kyle Brittain keep-
ing the Tartans’ slim hopes 
alive.
After a failed fourth down 
conversion, the Presidents 
needed only two plays to 
eliminate the progress Carn-
egie Mellon had made. The 
Tartans would score one more 
touchdown, but by the then, 
the game was already decid-
ed.
Carnegie Mellon returns 
home for the ?rst time this 
season, taking on Geneva Col-
lege this Saturday.

Since the July 31 non-
waiver trade deadline, Major 
League Baseball (MLB) stand-
ings have taken a bizarre turn. 
At the deadline, the Oakland 
Athletics had baseball’s best 
record by a signi?cant mar-
gin. The Atlanta Braves and 
Washington Nationals were 
locked in a tight race for the 
National League (NL) East. 
The Milwaukee Brewers 
looked like a sure?re playoff 
team, riding an excellent start 
to a midseason lead in the NL 
Central. The Detroit Tigers 
looked like they were going 
to walk leisurely to what feels 
like a 40th consecutive Ameri-
can League (AL) Central title.
None of those things are 
remotely true anymore due 
to a combination of dead-
line moves and baseball 
randomness.
The Oakland A's have 
been one of the worst teams 
in baseball since the trade 
deadline. After trading left 
?elder Yoenis Céspedes to 
the Boston Red Sox for ace 
starter Jon Lester, it appeared 
the A’s were gearing up for a 
World Series run. This was in 
addition to the acquisition of 
starter Jeff Samardzija earlier 
in the season. 
Céspedes had a great case 
as one of the most overrated 
players in baseball, as his 
back-to-back home run derby 
crowns could not mask an 
abysmal .298 on-base per-
centage at the deadline.
The A’s recent stumble 
has been bizarre and hard 
to make sense of. Lester has 
been very good, but a number 
of key players have cratered 
since the trade.
Catcher Derek Norris and 
?rst baseman Brandon Moss, 
two players who were hav-
ing excellent seasons as ma-
jor contributors to baseball’s 
best offense, have gone ice 
cold, providing very little pop 
to a lineup that switched out 
its biggest home run threat 
in Céspedes for utility ?eld-
ers. Starters Scott Kazmir and 
Sonny Gray have both seen 
huge drops in effectiveness as 
their innings piled up.
The A’s, who were once 
a common pick to win the 
World Series, now see their 
playoff hopes in peril. They 
sit only a half game above 
the Kansas City Royals for the 
?rst wild card and two games 
above the Seattle Mariners for 
the second wild card.
The Braves were never 
supposed to be as good as 
they are. After great pitching 
took the team to the playoffs 
last year, they lost three start-
ers in spring training. With 
very little everyday offensive 
talent in its lineup, the team 
was supposed to have a tough 
time repeating last season’s 
magic. 
For half the season, how-
ever, the starting rotation 
pitched very well. The ex-
pected contributions from 
ace Julio Tehran helped, but 
more important were guys 
like starter Aaron Harang suc-
ceeding seemingly out of no-
where. 
As of Tuesday, the Nation-
als have clinched the division, 
and the Braves are looking 
very far up at the Pittsburgh 
Pirates and New York Giants 
for wild card spots.
The Brewers are another 
team that seems to have lost 
their way since deadline day, 
which is particularly confus-
ing since they did not make 
any notable moves. It seems 
that the whole team was ei-
ther playing over its head and 
took longer than expected to 
regress to the mean, or tor-
rid stretches from the Pirates 
and St. Louis Cardinals simply 
outpaced the Brew Crew. 
Finally, the rise of the Roy-
als has been shocking and 
exciting. Perpetually tortured 
Royals fans might be treated 
to postseason baseball for 
the ?rst time since their 1985 
World Series victory, all due 
to several key changes since 
the trade deadline.
The Tigers seemed to be 
running away with their di-
vision, but some regression 
from starter Rick Porcello and 
terrible defensive play from 
their in?eld mired the Tigers. 
In what was an extended cold 
streak through August, the 
Royals were given the chance 
to heat the race up. 
Several Royals players also 
?nally seem to have found 
their swings despite brutal 
early season struggles. The 
crown jewels of the Royals’ 
farm system, ?rst baseman 
Eric Hosmer and third base-
man Mike Moustakas, were 
absolutely terrible for most of 
the season. 
Hosmer was eventually 
injured and Moustakas was 
sent to the minors. Upon re-
turn, both players have been 
putting up okay base num-
bers and surprising power 
numbers.
Royals starters Danny 
Duffy and Yordano Ventura 
were good for the ?rst half 
of the season and have been 
excellent since the deadline, 
with starter James Shields 
upping his play as well. This 
team has an amazing bull-
pen, with closer Greg Holland 
?anked by Wade Davis, the 
most effective reliever in the 
majors this year. 
Often the excitement of 
the postseason buries what 
goes on in the regular season. 
This A’s collapse could be re-
membered for a very long 
time, but minor changes since 
the trade deadline have dras-
tically altered the course of 
the MLB. 
These last few games and 
the postseason should of-
fer even more excitement in 
what, so far, has been a thrill-
ing season.

What does the future hold 
for Manchester United?
After all the euphoria 
caused by Manchester Unit-
ed’s unbeaten preseason un-
der Louis van Gaal, the world 
came crashing down for the 
fans and the club. 
They lost their ?rst game, 
at home to Swansea City 
2–1. A lot of the same prob-
lems were evident during the 
game: United was not inven-
tive, there were too many 
wasted possessions, and 
crosses seemed like the only 
outlet for attack. Of course, 
the defense was nothing short 
of calamitous.
It was all too reminiscent 
of outgoing manager David 
Moyes’s teams. When van 
Gaal took over, he splurged 
like United had never splurged 
before, bringing in defender 
Marcos Rojo, versatile defen-
sive mid?elder Daley Blind, 
and two world class signings 
in striker Radamel Falcao 
(on loan) and mid?elder Án-
gel Di María, the latter for a 
British record fee of 59.7 mil-
lion pounds. Results did not 
improve as United still drew 
1–1 at Sunderland and 0–0 at 
Burnley.
The worst, however, came 
when they were thrashed by 
Milton Keynes Dons, a League 
One team, 4–0 in the Capital 
One Cup. The international 
break came at a welcome time 
when the manager got time 
to integrate the signings and 
tweak the tactics, as well as 
formation of the team. 
The ?rst game after the 
break went well — the team 
scored a sound 4–0 victory 
over the hapless Queens Park 
Rangers (QPR). It was a fan-
tastic performance, with Di 
María proving he was worth 
all that money. 
So where exactly does 
United go from here? What 
should the fans expect from 
this team that has been letting 
them down time and again?
First, it would be ignorant 
to get carried away with hype 
after just one good perfor-
mance. Truth be told, QPR 
did not offer much going for-
ward and was in shambles 
defensively. Against a stingier 
defense, United may have still 
struggled, but the linkup play 
between Di María and mid-
?elder Ander Herrera, anoth-
er new signing, was encourag-
ing. United was also far from 
their best defensively, with 
the clean sheet a misleading 
fact.
Van Gaal switched to a 
back four instead of a back 
?ve, and though the coordina-
tion was better, the communi-
cation between the defenders 
and the keeper was still shaky. 
David de Gea, arguably Unit-
ed’s best and most consistent 
performer in nearly two years 
now, had uncharacteristic 
problems in goal. 
Rojo, meanwhile, started 
at left back this game, but it 
is likely that he will partner 
with Jones in the middle once 
new signing, Luke Shaw, is 
match ?t. Evans and Blackett 
will both probably drop to the 
bench. 
Rafael was fantastic 
against QPR, providing the 
attacking spark from the back 
United has missed since the 
Sir Alex Ferguson days after 
Moyes’s criminal mismanage-
ment of his full backs.
Moving forward, United 
should take note of how the 
diamond formation worked 
for them this game. The team 
lined up in a 4–1–2–1–2 for-
mat, with Blind playing the 
holding mid?elder, Di María 
and Herrera playing the shut-
tlers and Juan Mata playing 
in his favored No. 10 role be-
hind the strike duo of Wayne 
Rooney and Robin van Persie. 
This formation lets van Gaal 
play almost all of his new sign-
ings in their favored positions.
Di María as a left mid-
?elder in this formation is ar-
guably in the top ?ve players 
in the world. And Mata is up 
there with the best too. With 
van Persie’s form dipping 
recently, it is likely that Fal-
cao will take his place in the 
lineup. Teen prodigy Adnan 
Januzaj will also be able to get 
meaningful minutes as either 
the No. 10, where everyone 
sees his future lie, or as a sup-
port striker, a position he is 
comfortable playing.
The only issue with this 
formation is the demand it 
places on the full backs to 
provide the width and cover 
defensively. 
Fortunately for them, 
United is adequately stocked 
at both positions; Antonio Va-
lencia provides cover at right 
back and Rojo, Blackett, Blind 
and youngster Reece James 
are all able to play left back in-
stead of Shaw when needed. 
Once Micheal Carrick re-
turns, United will have suf-
?cient depth in mid?eld too, 
something they haven’t been 
able to say since 2008.
The early signs are encour-
aging after the QPR game 
that van Gaal is getting his 
message across to the team. 
He has placed extra emphasis 
on team bonding activities, 
such as dinners and inter-
views with each other while 
also ensuring that each and 
every non-English speaking 
member of the squad is tak-
ing lessons to become ?uent. 
Van Gaal is looking at United’s 
problems from the grass-root 
level and overhauling the en-
tire system of the club.
It seems like the team is ?-
nally moving on from the Sir 
Alex days. For their sake, let’s 
hope the QPR game wasn’t 
a ?ash in the pan. Let’s hope 
that Manchester United are 
on their way back to where 
they belong — on top of 
English football.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s football team traveled 
to Washington & Jefferson 
College on Saturday, hoping 
to recover from their shut-
out at the hands of rival Case 
Western Reserve University 
two weeks prior. Unfortu-
nately for the Tartans, the 
Presidents had a different 
idea and the Tartans ulti-
mately fell 48–30.
Washington & Jefferson 
made their dominance clear 
on the ?rst three possessions. 
After a 15-yard play and a 75-
yard drive off of the opening 
kickoff, the Presidents held 
the Tartans to a quick three-
and-out. Although a combi-
nation of ?rst-year punter 
and kicker Tyler Kohman’s 
directional punting and a 
Washington & Jefferson pen-
alty pushed the Presidents 
deep within their own terri-
tory, it only took two plays, 
a 17-yard run, and a 70-yard 
pass for the Tartans to be 
down two touchdowns less 
than seven minutes into the 
game.
To their credit, the Tartans 
responded with their own 
long drive, putting up their 
?rst points of the regular sea-
son and cutting the de?cit to 
seven with an 18-yard pass 
from junior quarterback An-
drew Hearon to junior wide 
receiver Chris Herrera. Carn-
egie Mellon then ?exed its 
muscle on defense, forcing a 
quick three-and-out and get-
ting the ball back to the of-
fense in good ?eld position. 
But Lady Luck was not on the 
Tartans’ side, as the drive was 
quickly stopped when sopho-
more running back Don Boy-
er fumbled away the football 
just three plays later.

After a mixed start to the 
season, the Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team has found 
its feet, as it capped off a fan-
tastic week with a 4-0 thump-
ing of Bethany College on Sat-
urday, which came after a 2-1 
victory at home against Wash-
ington & Jefferson College on 
Wednesday. 
The two victories move the 
Tartans to 5-3 for the season, 
and they now have a three-
game winning streak, scoring 
nine goals and conceding only 
one.
The scorers for the ?rst 
game were juniors mid?elder 
Connor Webb and forward 
and mid?elder Dimitrije 
Slavkovic, who scored their 
fourth and third goals of the 
season, respectively. 
In the second game, both 
Webb and Slavkovic, as well as 
sophomore mid?elder Tristan 
Lockwood and ?rst-year mid-
?elder Jimmy Jameson, got on 
the scoresheet. 
Jameson netted the ?rst 
goal of his career and Lock-
wood his ?rst for this season.
The plan against Washing-
ton & Jefferson seemed to be 
containing the opposition in 
the ?rst half and opening up 
the game more in the second.
While they did have a wob-
ble in the second half — con-
ceding a goal through a penal-
ty — the team’s plan worked. 
The Tartans were in control 
of the game throughout; there 
were no real clear cut chances 
for the opponents and quite a 
few for themselves.
Against Bethany, the at-
tacking unit racked up 28 
shots, with 12 of them on 
target. 
The defense was resolute 
too — they kept a clean sheet 
and allowed their opponents 
only two shots with one on tar-
get saved by junior goalkeeper 
Eric Bykowsky.
Head coach Brandon Bow-
man stated after the game 
against the Washington & 
Jefferson Presidents that the 
coaches had been preaching 
team unity as an important 
factor through the beginning 
of the season. 
His team seems to have re-
ceived the message loud and 
clear. They worked well as a 
unit and seemed to follow the 
coach’s instructions through-
out the game. 
Bowman commented that 
it’s down to the whole team to 
perform, and they have done 
just that.
The Tartans now get a 
week off, playing on Sept. 27 
at Grove City College.
The game will be the sec-
ond game of a three-game 
road trip that ends with a 
game in Chicago.

This weekend, the Carn-
egie Mellon volleyball team 
hosted the DoubleTree Invi-
tational at Skibo Gymnasium. 
The Tartans hosted ?ve teams 
and played a total of four 
games over the course of Fri-
day and Saturday, ultimately 
?nishing the weekend 3–1 
against the stiff competition.
In the ?rst match of the 
weekend, Carnegie Mellon 
took on the University of Mary 
Washington and opened the 
invitational on a high note, 
winning 3–1. 
After eking out a win in 
the ?rst set, 27–25, the team 
breezed through the sec-
ond set 25–12. The Tartans 
stumbled in the third, fall-
ing 23–25, but ultimately put 
away Mary Washington 25–17 
in the fourth and ?nal set. Se-
nior right setter Ali Celentano 
dominated the service game 
with ?ve aces, while ?rst-year 
outside hitter Heather Holton 
and Celentano racked up the 
kills for the Tartans with 11 
and nine, respectively. 
Sophomore setter and op-
posite hitter Emily Newton 
and ?rst-year setter Amanda 
Thiele led the team with 14 
and 13 assists, respectively.
Next up for Carnegie Mel-
lon was the 5th ranked Uni-
versity of Mount Union. The 
Tartans again took the ?rst set, 
this time 25–23 before drop-
ping the second 16–25. They 
then rallied and put away the 
nationally ranked opposition 
25–14 and 25–23 in front of 
a packed home crowd. Celen-
tano followed up the previous 
game with another ?ve aces 
and increased her kill total to 
22 over the course of the dou-
ble header. Sophomore defen-
sive specialist Molly Higgins 
spearheaded the defensive ef-
fort with 23 digs.
In the third match of the 
weekend, and the ?rst on 
Saturday, the Tartans took on 
John Carroll University. There 
appeared to be a bit of a hang-
over following the big win 
over Mount Union, with Carn-
egie Mellon quickly falling. 
Not as devastating as the 
blowout losses last week, the 
Tartans were able to keep 
things competitive falling 24–
26, 21–25 and 23–25. While 
the service game was slightly 
weaker than the night before, 
the major change was in the 
number of kills, with John 
Carroll nearly doubling the 
Tartans totals 53 to 27.
The ?nal match of the 
weekend offered some sem-
blance of redemption for 
Carnegie Mellon as they de-
feated La Roche College 3–1. 
They came out strong, just 
as they had in their previous 
wins 25–19, before falling in 
the second set 21–25. Deter-
mined to end the invitational 
on a high note, the Tartans 
won the remaining two sets 
25–17 and 25–12. 
Newton and Thiele repeat-
ed their performances from 
earlier in the weekend against 
Mary Washington, again lead-
ing the team, this time with 14 
assists a piece.
The Tartans play DePauw 
University next on Sunday at 
the College of Wooster.

---------------------------------------------------

Located in the Miller Gallery on campus between the 
Jared L. Cohon University Center and Warner Hall, 
the multimedia exhibit, curated by Casey Droege,
features pieces from artists such as Edith Abeyta, 
Michael Lewis Miller, Gavin Benjamin, David 
Bernabo, Alexis Gideon, Ulric Joseph, Jessica 
Langley, Celeste Neuhaus, and Drew Droege. The 
exhibit, which is part of the 2014 Pittsburgh Biennial, 
is open from Sept. 20 to Nov. 30.
Catching Power by Ulric Joseph features a series 
of oil paintings that depict themes of corruption, 
materialism, culture shock, and racism. All paintings 
in the exhibit feature interesting use of color and 
glitter. The glitter mixes into the colors of the 
paintings, making it dif?cult to immediately discern, 
warranting another look. The paintings depicting 
cultural and native life in Trinidad, Joseph’s home 
country, use vibrant primary colors. As a result, the 
colorful background and clothing heavily contrasts 
against the dark skin of Joseph’s subjects, accenting 
his technically competent detail. One such painting, 
which shows two Trinidadian women with head 
wraps and colorful red dresses, features large fake 
gems. It’s clear that Joseph wishes to contrast his 
Trinidadian upbringing with American consumerism 
and culture.
In “Predator,” Joseph uses toned down earthy colors to 
create an ominous atmosphere. The painting consists 
of a stalking black man on a grassy plain, looking 
straight at the viewer while wearing a large gold 
chain and earring. Joseph challenges his audience by 
relaying his experience of being generalized as violent 
simply due to his skin color. To challenge this view, 
Joseph has a set of portraits depicting faces of African 
American people smiling at different angles. Joseph’s 
style carries across facial expressions quite well, 
and it’s clear that he wishes to humanize the often 
brutalized black man, a minority he feels has been 
unfairly judged as violent and materialistic.
Another favorite was Video Muses III: Floating 
Oceans by Alexis Gideon. A multimedia 
presentation, Gideon uses the unexpected medium 
of claymation to tackle heavy ideas, such as 
existentialism and consumerism.
The video is accompanied by very percussion-
heavy music and narration in the form of rap. The 
rhythm of the video is very thematic in nature, as 
Gideon explores the nature of dreams and memory 
in our daily lives; the rhythm of the percussion and 
spoken work tend to mutate to match. For example, 
when the protagonist of the video is pondering the 
crushing mundanity of everyday life, the rapping and 
percussive beat becomes very uniform and steady, 
lending to the emotional impact of the scene.
In contrast, the dream sequences feature spaced out, 
syncopated, surreal rhythms. Memories and dreams 
feature a unique visual style as well. In dreams, 2-D 
pictures are interspersed with claymation to give a 
surreal feel to the dream, as if details are omitted. 
Memories are also heavily stylized, to re?ect the fact 
that a memory of something is as unreliable as a 
dream. Memorable scenes include a window washer, 
who, as he slips, desperately tries to carve his name 
into the building’s scaffolding before he falls to his 
death, and a portrayal of two men eternally bidding 
over a tattered brown coat.
These are but two of the exhibits on display at the 
Miller Gallery, most of which contain high quality art. 
Plus, there is the possibility of talking to the artists if 
you go during a presentation, which is far too good 
an opportunity for the newbies and a?cionados alike 
to pass up.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
It’s Saturday night, and 
I’m drunkenly stumbling 
around Shadyside trying 
to find my way home, and 
my phone is dead. Here, 
this large patch of grass 
looks like a nice place to 
rest. Should I just sleep 
here for a couple hours?
Incoherently,

Dear RIP PHI,
Something very similar 
happened to one of my old 
roommates. 
He decided to sleep there, 
but a policewoman picked 
him up. The kind woman 
invited him — well, shoved 
him — into the back of her 
vehicle, escorted him back 
to his apartment — which 
ended up being a block and 
a half away — and knocked 
on one of his roommate’s 
doors (my door).
“Is this his apartment?” 
she asked, pointing to 
a sheepishly grinning 
roommate. Meanwhile, I 
was experiencing rapidly 
fluctuating emotions 
somewhere between pissed 
at being woken up, and 
frightened at there being a 
policewoman standing in my 
living room.
Apparently, he wasn’t fined 
or cited. So yeah, go ahead 
and sleep on the guy’s lawn. 
You can probably get the 
police to take you home!
Or just don’t go drinking 
alone,

Dear Evan,
How do I get a third 
helping of ice cream 
from the cooler in Schatz 
without the omelette guy 
giving me a judgmental 
look? He’s been watching 
me binge this whole time.

Dear SHAMEFUL,
Well, what were you doing 
in Schatz, anyway? No one 
ever eats there after their 
first year — oh, wait, you’re 
a first-year? Okay, perfectly 
acceptable. Sorry for 
jumping to conclusions.
It’s not like the ice cream 
you’re eating is any worse 
for you than those balls of 
grease the omelette guy 
serves up, so you don’t 
have to feel bad about the 
actual eating. As far as 
his glaring goes, look him 
straight in the eye and chew 
your ice cream slowly and 
satisfyingly; he’ll just be 
jealous.
Or just get your ice cream 
at Dave & Andy’s,
Evan Kahn

Rush, “Steal My Sunshine” is a mesmerizing tune. It’s 
calm enough to put you to sleep, but not because it’s 
boring. The song samples “More More More” by the 
Andrea True Connection, slowing down the original tune 
until it bops along at a head bobbing pace. The song is 
sure to bring you back to the beach and summer, even as 
the leaves turn colors on the Cut.
The music video seems like the ?nal product of someone 
learning how to use slideshow transitions for the ?rst 
time. And don’t forget to watch the clearly out-of-sync 
lipsyncing.
The Anthem 2003
Remember when you were a rebellious teenager? 
Remember when everyone around you thought it was 
cool to dress in entirely black clothes and chains? Good 
Charlotte’s “The Anthem,” from The Young and the 
Hopeless (cheerful title for an album, huh?) is a reminder 
of just how unique and rebellious you are. The song 
empowers listeners to be individuals who won’t take 
advice from anyone with its in-your-face vocals by lead 
vocalist Joel Madden. Despite the song’s drab outlook, 
you won’t be able to get it out of your head, and you’ll 
probably ?nd yourself listening to it more than once in a 
row.
Want to learn how to look tough popping wheelies on a 
bike or ?ashing the peace sign? This music video’s for 
you.
Blue (Da Ba Dee) 1999
This is the song that literally turned us all blue and made 
no sense, but we sang along anyway. Recorded by Eiffel 
65 for their debut album Europop, the song repeats the 
word “blue” 36 times and requires very little practice 
to master its chorus (“I’m blue, da ba dee da ba di”). 
Try matching the autotuned voices with your own un-
autotuned voice though. Bet you can’t. Don’t watch the 
music video. Seriously.; it’s terrible.
Hey Ya! 2003
OutKast: “Shake it like a Polaroid picture!” ‘Nuff said.
Hollaback Girl 2005
“This s*** is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S.” Gwen Stefani 
is probably the only artist who can claim she got almost 
every high school cheerleader in America and their 
friends to scream out the name of a fruit like it was the 
coolest thing since Nintendo released the N64. Listen to 
this song for the rare times when you miss high school 
and having a full turnout at football games.
The music video is exactly what you’d expect —Gwen 
asserting herself as a tough cheerleader leading a 
marching band, because what else would you expect 
from a song overrun by piercing whistles and high 
school marching band instrument solos?
Stacy’s Mom 2003
Just like Stacy’s mom, this song has got it going on. 
Fountains of Wayne clearly doesn’t take itself seriously 
with this song, which is on their album Welcome 
Interstate Managers. If for some reason you don’t already 
know it, this song is about a boy and his fantasies with 
his friend Stacy’s mom, as he fawns over their every 
interaction. There’s no meaning behind it beyond that, 
so don’t go looking for any.
The music video? A pubescent teen getting ?ustered by 
an older woman.
1985 2004
From Bowling For Soup’s A Hangover You Don’t Deserve, 
“1985” is a catchy little tune that took the world by storm 
in 2004. Filled with cultural references galore (“Bruce 
Springsteen, Madonna/Way before Nirvana/There was 
U2 and Blondie/And music still on MTV”), the song 
caters to both a younger audience with its punk rock 
style and an older audience of parents who can’t help 
but be reminded of why their music growing up was so 
much better than the music produced today.
Oops!... I Did It Again 2000
Probably the most iconic Britney Spears song ever, 
“Oops!... I Did It Again” appeared on the artist’s 
second album of the same name and contains a pretty 
conspicuous reference to James Cameron’s 1997 Titanic 
?lm. You could honestly swap this song with any one of 
Spears’ earlier hits and maintain the quality of this stellar 
throwback playlist.
Watch the music video to see Britney seduce an 
astronaut in space and then leave him in the dust.
How You Remind Me 2001
Before you screech at the presence of a Nickelback song 
on this list, take a few minutes to listen to “How You 
Remind Me.” Also remember that Nickelback once put 
out music decent enough to make it onto top 100 lists 
and into car radios. That said, this song may only be 
good for a few listens before it becomes monotonous.
It’s hard to listen to something over and over again if it 
has a slower pace and gruffer feel. The chorus is simple 
enough to learn, yet complex enough that you aren’t 
singing the same three or four words.
If you know what Nickelback’s lead singer looks like, 
then you know everything about this music video: Since 
it basically consists of closeups of Chad Kroeger and his 
long, wavy hair.
All Star 1999
You should probably put your ?ngers up in the shape 
of an L on your forehead if you don’t know every word 
to this Smash Mouth smash hit. The song is on Astro 
Lounge and also appeared as a lead soundtrack song 
in the ?rst Shrek. Put this one on in the library, cluster, 
or wherever you are and see who belts out the song 
with you. Give shade to the haters and power your way 
through to the end if no one sings along.
Watch the ?rst few seconds of the music video to see 
appearances by Ben Stiller and other guests in clips of 
cult classic Mystery Man mashed up with Smash Mouth 
vocals.

Life Round Here
It’s weird that James Blake, considering the style on 
his latest album, was ?rst compartmentalized as a 
dubstep artist.
Have you heard Overgrown? No? “Save yourself 
?rst.”
The remix of “Life Round Here” is an interesting 
track. Blake’s voice ?oats over a beautiful electronic 
atmosphere of blossoming synthesizers and light 
drums until Chano (Chance the Rapper) jumps 
on the track out of nowhere in the same ?erce 
way that Andre 3000 leaps on “Do Ya Thang,” the 
surprisingly slamming song Andre teamed with 
the Gorillaz and James Murphy to produce for 
Converse sneakers.
You have to love it when a talented producer and a 
skilled rapper collaborate, and that’s exactly what 
happens here.

First time writer-director Ned Benson has created The 
Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby, an ambitious love 
story that functions as a three-part series through the 
perspectives of its romantic duo. “Him” and “Her” are 
each ?lmed in the subjective narrative of Connor Ludlow 
(James McAvoy) and Eleanor Rigby (Jessica Chastain), 
while “Them” is meant to function as the most objective 
journey through the couple’s relationship and eventual 
downfall.
While the title of the ?lm is just plain silly, McAvoy 
and Chastain are wonderful in their portrayal of two 
people struggling with loss and nostalgia. It’s mainly 
their performances that uplifts “Them,” especially in 
moments when the ?lm fails.
“Them” starts with a ?ashback of Connor and Eleanor 
(yes, her name is a silly allusion to the Beatles song) 
still in the honeymoon phases of their marriage, giddily 
playing dine-and-dash at a restaurant and running away 
to a nearby park. In the midst of a makeout session, 
cued by ?re?ies to celebrate their union, Connor then 
utters the very cheesy line “Hey, Rigby. There’s only one 
heart in this body. Have mercy on my soul.” They kiss in 
a moment of pure bliss.
Flash forward to the present, as Eleanor attempts 
suicide by jumping off a bridge. What caused 
Eleanor to be so unhappy so fast? The ?lm reveals 
the answer much later as it weaves through Connor 
and Eleanor’s lives as newly estranged spouses. 
This marks the “disappearance” that is referred 
to in the ?lm’s obnoxious title as not Eleanor’s 
absence in Connor’s life, but rather the complete 
demise of who Eleanor once was. The utter loss that 
Eleanor, in particular, grapples with results in the 
extinguishment of any desire for her to continue 
living for herself and for Connor.
“Them” is unique through its elegant vision and 
delicate performances. It’s pacing is deliberate and 
elusive, as if shifts between the narratives of the two 
characters as well as through random ?ashbacks. 
The ephemerality of the pacing intentionally 
functions like that of memories, not centered on plot 
or cinematic style but, rather, on how Connor and 
Eleanor subjectively remember their marriage and 
the aftermath.
For the most part, “Them” separates the couple, 
trying to show how Eleanor and Connor are dealing 
with this unspoken tragedy. Unfortunately, the 
?lmmakers don’t do a great job of showing this 
reaction. Eleanor and Connor experience moments 
of affection, regret, and joy. 
They are beautiful memories 
that show the love and 
sel?essness that the couple 
had for one another. But it 
quickly fades away as they 
revert back to their original positions of 
moping.
Sure, these are genuinely ?awed 
characters, but this constant return to 
bitter brooding is what makes the ?lm 
so annoying to endure for two hours. 
The point of ?lm in general is to explore 
human con?ict, pain, and eventual 
recovery. “Them” nailed down the con?ict 
and the pain, but skipped out on the 
recovery.
Overall, The Disappearance of Eleanor 
Rigby fails to be a ful?lling ?lm. And not 
in a way that would magically tie itself 
up in a happy ending with a ribbon on 
top. Its failure lies in its inability to show 
how Eleanor and Connor interact with 
the world, in a way that would show how their loss and 
troubles manifest themselves in a tangible way. Yes, for 
two hours we watch Connor and Eleanor sulking around 
the streets of New York with a brooding sensibility, but 
nothing in their relationship is furthered by this in any 
way. They put on a facade of “letting go” by giving in 
to their constricting circumstances, never allowing the 
opportunity for them to fully heal from their marriage. 
The exploration of tragedy, in this case, is elegantly 
displayed but ends up being frustrating as the aftermath 
is never fully realized.

The FOX comedy series New Girl saw its season 
premiere on Tuesday, and it appears that creator Liz 
Meriwether is following through on her promise to “sex 
things up.”
Let’s get this out of the way. Yes, ?ve 30-somethings still 
live together. Yes, ?ve 30-somethings are all still single. 
Yes, ?ve 30-somethings still do everything with each 
other. Get over it; it’s ?ctional television.
The episode starts off with the problem most 
30-somethings are depicted as having to deal with: 
the summer wedding season. It’s the tail end of the 
season, and you can tell the toll it has had on Jess (Zooey 
Deschanel). Her break up with Nick (Jake Johnson) is 
still fresh and settling like a The Real Housewives of 
Beverly Hills cast member’s newly remodeled face.
Not much has changed since viewers left the gang in 
the third season ?nale. Everyone is still single, and with 
this being the last wedding of the season, Schmidt (Max 
Green?eld) decrees, “we are hooking up tonight, all ?ve 
of us.” 
And with a Game of Thrones reference — winter is 
coming — the gang is off.
The wedding ceremony ends and as the party starts 
up, Jess sets her big, blue, doughy eyes on “wedding 
celebrity” best man Ted (Reid Scott, or Dan on Veep). 
However, no path to victory is smooth. Enter Kat 
(Jessica Biel, Mrs. Justin Timberlake), who is never tired, 
technically a genius, and lost her virginity to Malcolm 
Gladwell (Google him. I had to. It’s worth the extra 
laugh).
Jess and Kat do what they call the “Joe Biden,” a.k.a. 
stalk Ted throughout the entire episode. (Side note: how 
come that doesn’t creep him out?) As the night winds 
down, Ted cannot make up his mind. Kat gets bored and 
goes home with a priest, and Jess, feeling undervalued, 
gives up on Operation Get Laid.
Elsewhere in the episode, Schmidt and Nick 
contemplate a foursome with two bridesmaids (Nick is 
more reluctant than Schmidt, naturally). But when newly 
single Cece (Hannah Simone) returns from Australia, 
it shakes Schmidt (who is admittedly still in love with 
Cece), and he ultimately decides not to go through with 
the foursome, much to Nick’s relief.
On the other side of the wedding venue, Coach (Damon 
Wayans Jr.) keeps running into the women he has slept 
with during the wedding circuit this summer. This 
includes waiters, young partygoers, older partygoers, 
bartenders, and photographers. It seems as though he 
has exhausted his resources, for this year, at least. And 
due to his exhaustive workouts in the police academy, 
Winston’s (Lamorne Morris) sore muscles and immobility 
mean that his ice packs are his best chance of bringing 
something home. 
The night ends with everyone heading back to the 
apartment to get drunk and make fun of all the married 
couples on their night of singularity.
New Girl premiered Sept. 16 and is scheduled to air 
every Tuesday at 9 p.m. on FOX.

If you are like me and have had enough of Jonah Hill for the next ten years from 
watching The Wolf of Wall Street, but could stare at Channing Tatum’s jawline for 
hours, then you will probably like 22 Jump Street. The Hill-Tatum pairing is very 
well balanced (hence the sequel). But this time they aren’t going back to high 
school. No, sir, they are moving on up to college (just like us!). The studious, 
detail-oriented Schmidt (Hill) and athletic, idiotic Jenko (Tatum) are once again 
assigned to a case that involves them going undercover to arrest the drug dealer 
of a new drug called WHYPHY. Though very similar to 21 Jump Street in structure, 
the writers were aware of this and made fun of themselves as much as they could. 
This sequel, while eccentric at times, gives a spirited take on the cop movie.

Have you ever seen a movie starring food? Me neither, unless you count 
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and its sequel. So let me introduce you 
to Chef, a lighthearted chronicle of cook Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) moving 
from the cutthroat world of high-end cookery to the gritty world of food trucks. 
Jon Favreau steps out from behind the camera and takes a stab at being the 
leading man. The supporting cast is nothing to scoff at, with Hollywood  
heavy-hitters like Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey Jr., and Scarlett Johansson. 
This is the classic story of man getting ?red from highbrow job, man starting 
own company, and man’s company becoming successful. All that needed to 
happen next was “man gets own Food Network show.”

authority  — he claimed his wife allowed him to go 
through with the idea – and must have begun excitedly 
pondering the heights to which this song would take 
him.
And like Faust, Thicke brie?y saw all of his dreams 
come true. “Blurred Lines” ripped a hole in the cultural 
continuum, becoming a fact of life for just about anyone 
who existed within earshot of a speaker. But not 
everyone was singing along.
Women everywhere began commenting on the song’s 
lyrical message. Lisa Huynh wrote in a post on her 
“feminist in LA” blog in April 2013 that “the majority of 
the song has the R&B singer murmuring ‘I know you 
want it’ over and over into a girl’s ear. Call me a cynic, 
but that phrase does not exactly encompass the notion 
of consent in sexual activity.”
In September 2013, Project Unbreakable, a photographic 
project dedicated to rape survivors, held up placards 
comparing words spoken by their attackers to lines 
from the song. In November 2013, the student union of 
University College London of?cially banned the song 
from play, joining another 20 student unions in the UK 
who’d already done so. A July 2014 “#AskThicke” twitter 
stunt resulted in the singer’s feed being ?ooded with 
comments relating to the song’s controversy, including 
such gems as “When you’re not busy objectifying 
women, making light of rape and justifying sexual 
violence, how do you like to relax?” and “The world my 
kids will grow up in is less safe because of Blurred Lines. 
How can you ?x that?”
Thicke could’ve shielded himself from some of the 
blowback by admitting the truth: that he didn’t actually 
write the song. But in interviews — interviews we now 
know he’d prepared for by downing a water bottle of 
vodka and a couple of prescription painkillers — he 
constantly held to his original story that a) he helped 
write it and b) the plan was for it to sound somewhat 
similar to “Got To Give It Up” the entire time. Why 
did Thicke do this? The reason is actually pretty 
understandable:
“I always prided myself on the fact that I wrote and 
produced my ?rst six albums myself … Once [Blurred 
Lines] became successful, I felt like I wanted to have 
some of the credit for the other six albums worth of work 
that I had done.”
Williams wrote the song, but because it was Thicke’s 
face and voice all over it, Thicke got the blame.
Thicke vehemently defended the song in interviews by 
saying that everyone needed to lighten up and not take 
the song so seriously. His appearance on the Today Show 
now appears particularly sad. When asked how he felt 
about having the hit of the summer, Thicke responded, 
“Dreams really do come true. If you stay committed and 
keep trying, your dreams do come true.” As long as 
they’re the dreams of someone who knows how to dream 
for a mass audience.
At the end of the interview, Thicke broke into a 
performance of his song “Take It Easy On Me,” which he 
prefaced with a request that the world do the same to 
him. 
Come on guys, I didn’t even write it. No one seemed to 
care when I was pouring my heart into my work. Now 
that I’ve given you what you want, please just let me 
have my moment in the sun.
During his performance later that year at the VMAs, 
Miley Cyrus gyrated against his pelvis and everyone 
thought, “Gross. Isn’t that guy almost old enough 
to be her father?” For a man who had sparked a 
national discussion of sexual misconduct, dancing 
suggestively with a teen on national television certainly 
was a misstep. But once again, it’s hardly likely the 
performance was Thicke’s idea at all.
Given the way telecast awards shows are run — 
especially ones on the ever image-conscious MTV — it’s 
much more plausible that show producers devised the 
entire thing and Thicke was once again simply given 
instructions. But it was Thicke’s pelvis on screen, and 
thus Thicke once again got the blame.
Shortly after the VMAs, the infamous picture of Thicke 
grabbing model Lana Scolaro at an after-party surfaced. 
In February 2014, Paula Patton and Thicke announced 
their “mutual” separation.
In July 2014, Thicke released an album that he hoped 
would win back his ex-wife. Titled Paula, the record 
sports such hopefully sad song titles as “Get Her Back,” 
“Love Can Grow Back,” and “Too Little Too Late.” The 
album was a failure in all categories: Paula did not take 
him back, and the album completely bombed.
So now, what does Robin Thicke have left? His career 
will likely never recover from the damage wrought by 
“Blurred Lines,” his marriage to a woman he’d been with 
since they were 14 years old lies in a million little pieces 
on his bathroom ?oor, Marvin Gaye’s family is still suing 
him over the song he didn’t write, and everyone thinks 
the words “sexual assault” when they hear his name. At 
least he’s sober:
“I’ve been sober for the last two months. When your wife 
leaves you, it gives you good reason to sober up … I’ve 
actually only been sober off the … Vicodin. I still drink.”
Well, at least he’s off the pills.
So now, about a year and a half after “Blurred Lines” was 
unleashed upon the world, Thicke has lost just about 
everything he’d spent so many years building. He sold 
his soul for a shot at fame, allowed himself to be handled 
like a monkey, and will now only remain relevant as long 
as using his name as the butt of a crass joke is still funny.
Damn you Devil, why couldn’t you let this one go?

They always said the Devil would be attractive. They just 
never said he’d be the guy who sang “Get Lucky.”
These words must certainly have passed through Robin 
Thicke’s mind a few times in the last year. The R&B 
crooner’s career suddenly exploded in March 2013 with 
the release of “Blurred Lines,” an I-just-can’t-help-myself-
no-matter-how-hard-I-try catchy ode to womanizing 
that Thicke, according to album credits, co-wrote with 
Pharrell Williams. The song, as we know all too well, 
went on to become the “song of the summer.”
But the Devil was lurking in the shadows, and as 
“Blurred Lines” shot to the top of the charts, Thicke saw 
his life disintegrate in the afterburn.
Controversy surrounding the song’s misogynistic 
and rape-condoning lyrical content, as well as the 
infamous NSFW music video, made Thicke a token in 
conversations about sexual assault.
A performance at the VMAs with Miley Cyrus — the 
twerk heard ‘round the world — put him at the center of 
a cultural ?restorm involving sexual exploitation of teens, 
misguided racial appropriation, and bad music.
A widely circulated photograph of Thicke placing his 
hand on a model’s rear end at a VMAs after-party was 
followed by an announcement of his divorce from wife 
Paula Patton, whom he’d been with since the two were 
teenagers.
His latest album, released in July and titled Paula, is a 
14-track (15 if you count the Afrojack remix) plea to his 
ex-wife to take him back. She has not, and the album 
?opped. In its ?rst week of release in the UK, Paula 
moved 530 copies — in Australia, 54.
And now, due to an ongoing lawsuit over whether 
“Blurred Lines” plagiarized soul superstar Marvin Gaye’s 
1977 hit “Got To Give It Up,” a new element in the 
breaking of Robin Thicke has been revealed through 
recently released court deposition papers: He didn’t 
actually write the song that catapulted him to the upper 
echelon of fame and then snapped him like Matzah.
In fact, he arrived late to the studio and the song was 
already “80% ?nished.” In fact, he was too high to be 
of any help in the studio, save provide vocals. In fact, 
he’s been high pretty much all the time for the past 
year, especially in interviews where he vigorously 
defended his art against detractors who accused him of 
perpetuating rape culture in America.
The admissions Thicke made in that court deposition — 
no doubt made to try to clear himself of any wrongdoing 
in this copyright suit — cast Thicke’s greatest year in 
a whole new light. Whereas before Thicke’s story was 
the downfall of a man who tried to appeal to our basest 
instincts with primitive lyrics tied to a catchy beat and 
received the due backlash, it now looks more like Willy 
Loman’s: the story of a desperate man who just wanted 
people to like him.
Thicke was desperate enough for fame that he signed 
in blood on the dotted line and just didn’t expect how 
much would be asked in return.
Before “Blurred Lines,” the average American’s opinion 
on Thicke and his gorgeous baby blues was, at best, 
total apathy. And while Thicke’s career may not have 
been the most successful in music, it was certainly one 
to be proud of.
His music career began before he was even out of high 
school. Thicke formed a vocal group (boy band), As One, 
and asked his father — television actor Alan Thicke, 
or “the dad from Growing Pains” — if he could have 
some money for a professional demo. Alan, accustomed 
to dispensing sagely fatherly advice to a blossoming 
Leonardo DiCaprio, told his son that he’d have to ?nish 
high school before following his dreams of singing 
smooth songs of seduction and heartbreak.
Like all determined kids, Thicke got what he wanted 
regardless. After securing the money from a friend’s 
uncle, he recorded the four-song demo, which eventually 
found its way into the lap of producer and R&B singer 
Brian McKnight, with whom Thicke would co-write the 
1995 hit “Anyway,” off McKnight’s second album. From 
there, the 17-year-old Thicke began making a name 
for himself as an industry-man: producing and writing 
songs for artists.
With the new millennium came new aspirations, and 
Thicke began working on his own album. 2002 saw the 
release of his debut single, “When I Get You Alone.” The 
music video depicts a younger, simpler Thicke, gleefully 
riding a bicycle through the streets of Manhattan, his 
wild and untamed hair ?owing free as he rhythmically 
bounces on the handlebars like an overexcited child.
The years 2003 through 2011 would see Thicke release 
a total of ?ve albums, all of them written and produced 
by Thicke himself. That kind of output — especially for 
a pop and R&B singer — is pretty impressive, and while 
Thicke’s singles never made a huge pop-culture splash, 
they still sold well. But it just wasn’t enough.
Fast forward to 2013, as Thicke began work on his sixth 
album. He had a studio session booked with superstar 
producer Pharrell Williams, who was behind pop staples 
“I’m a Slave 4 U,” “Hot in Herre,” and many more.
In the story he told in 2013, Thicke strolled into the 
studio humming the Marvin Gaye tune “Got To Give It 
Up,” and suggested the two try to write a song that had 
a similar groove and style. They bounced ideas around 
the room, began catcalling to each other and thought it 
was funny so they threw their creepy “I know you want 
it”s into the song, and ?nally walked out with “Blurred 
Lines.”
But now we know how it actually went down.
Running (very) late, Thicke arrived at the studio bombed 
out of his gourd on Vicodin and alcohol, ready to sit 
down with Williams and write a song. Except Williams 
was pretty much done already and, seeing as Thicke 
was likely useless given that chemical cocktail, told the 
man to get in the booth and sing the words he’d written.
Once it was completed and they were listening to it, 
Thicke surely must have made the realization that he, 
at last, had a bona ?de hit on his hands, and that he’d 
had absolutely nothing to do with it. Five albums and 
18 years of writing and producing songs, giving it his 
absolute all, and his ?rst smash would have happened 
with or without him. It must’ve felt like proof that 
nothing he ever composed himself would be good 
enough; that he, frankly, wasn’t superstar material. Even 
with the in?ated ego granted by a water bottle of vodka, 
that must’ve cut deep.
On that day, Thicke picked up the pen and held it in his 
hand, the ?aming contract in front of him. But it wasn’t 
until he sat down with music video director Diane Martel 
that he unwittingly sealed his own doom.
Martel got her start directing videos for 1990s New York 
hip-hop acts such as Lords of the Underground and 
Method Man. She also helmed many of Mariah Carey’s 
early videos, shepherding Carey’s transformation from 
innocent songstress to sexy pop diva.
Thicke asked for a “white cyc” video — meaning all 
the action is ?lmed against a blank background — and 
Martel factored that into her vision: “to make videos 
that sell records … not to make videos that express 
my own obsessions, but to make videos that move 
units.” What better way to move units than simply put 
a bunch of naked models on the screen, make a porno 
and call it “NSFW,” and release it into the Internet? 
From a marketing standpoint, I’d say it’s uninspired, but 
certainly effective.
Thicke reported that he had his doubts about the video, 
but declared in an interview that he decided  “Hey … 
let’s go for it …’cause for me, nudity is the least offensive 
thing in the world.” And just like a hopeless middle

Before you throw the paper away in disgust and turn 
to your bacon for comfort, hear me out. A vegetarian 
lifestyle may not be for everyone, but neither is the 
carnivorous track. Every once in a while, it’s good to set 
the steaks aside and go for a nice veggie roast. Here are 
some recipes that can be exclusively sides or vamped up 
and turned into a meal.
Zucchini-Corn Fritters
The most amazing thing about this recipe, besides the 
taste of course, is the amount of water you have to drain 
from the zucchini before you mix in everything else. It’s 
positively mind-boggling. When you do it yourself, you’ll 
understand why you absolutely cannot skip that step. 
You will end up with a soggy mess that stains everything 
it touches green. You’ve been warned.
2 good-sized zucchinis
½ can of corn
¼ cup of ?our
1 tablespoon of cornstarch
1 egg
Plenty of salt, pepper, and red pepper
Plenty of vegetable oil for frying
1) Start by shredding the zucchini into a medium bowl. 
Strain as much of the water out of the zucchini as 
possible. The best way to do this is to start the old-
fashioned way and make a zucchini snowball with your 
hands. Squeeze the zucchini ball and try not to gag 
while the juice squelches out. Repeat about three times. 
Then, put the ball back into the bowl, wash your hands, 
and sprinkle the zucchini with salt. The salt extracts the 
water from the zucchini, but it’ll take about 10 minutes 
for that to happen. Be patient. Just go scroll through 
Facebook or something. It’s worth it.
2) Whew. If you got through that, you’re basically done. 
3) Pour about a tablespoon or two of oil into a pan, and 
turn the heat up. It’s about to get hot in here.
4) Mix in the corn, then the egg, and then add the 
cornstarch and ?our.
5) Season to taste with the red pepper, black pepper, and 
salt.
6) Form patties with your hands and fry them lightly in 
the pan. Mmmm.
This recipe was inspired in part by bonappetit.com.
The World’s Fanciest Brussels Sprouts
What are the worst two vegetables in the world? 
Brussels sprouts and artichokes. It’s an indisputable 
and universal truth. Naturally, that means that the true 
talent in cooking these vegetables lies in well, lying. You 
have to empower the Brussels sprouts to be more than a 
vegetable … they have to be anything but. The solution 
here is butter and seasoning. This recipe uses just a dab 
of butter and delicious fresh rosemary to spruce up a 
boring old bunch of sprouts. Classic. Pair this with pasta 
and turn it into dinner.
1 bag of Brussels sprouts 
Olive oil
1 tablespoon of butter
3 or 4 sprigs of fresh rosemary (don’t panic, just look for 
the herbs at GEagle)
¼ cup of lemon juice
Salt and pepper
1) Wash the Brussels sprouts and cut them in half. Put 
the halves in a bowl.
2) Drizzle them with olive oil. Not so much that it’s 
dripping, but enough to make the herbs and salt stick to 
the sprouts. 
3) Season the sprouts with generous salt and pepper. 
Strip the rosemary leaves off of the stem (otherwise, it’s 
basically like eating a stick) and add them to the mix as 
well. Set this aside, and let it marinate as you move on. 
4) Heat the butter in a pan. Just as it starts to melt and 
slide around, pour the sprouts in with it. Get ready to 
concentrate.
5) Pay attention while the sprouts are cooking. It’s easy 
to burn them. They’ll need to cook for a while because 
they’re fairly tough, and it’s unpleasant to have a 
mouthful of uncooked Brussels sprouts.
6) While the sprouts are cooking, make sure to turn them 
over so the outside leaves don’t burn. The layers are the 
big challenge here. Stick with it.
7) You know that the Brussels sprouts are cooked when 
you can easily stab one with a fork. At that point, take 
them out of the pan, and voilà. You have a beautiful bowl 
of well-seasoned sprouts.
Farm Fresh Bruschetta, or a pile of vegetables on 
toasted bread
Appetizer no more, this bruschetta is strong, bold, spicy, 
and substantial. Two or three pieces of this bad boy, and 
you’ll be bursting. Make sure to use a nice loaf of Italian 
bread with a thick crust for a solid base and a layer of 
cheese to separate the juices from the vegetables from 
the fragile, golden crust of the bread — unless, of course, 
you like your bruschetta soggy and caving in. 
1 loaf of Italian bread with thick crust, sliced
1 tomato
1 zucchini
1 white onion
4 cloves of garlic
2 peppers, red or yellow
Sliced mozzarella cheese (or whichever cheese strikes 
your fancy)
Olive oil
Salt, pepper, red pepper ?akes, basil ?akes, and paprika
Butter
1) Start with some old-fashioned slice and dice. Cut the 
vegetables (tomato, zucchini, onion, and peppers) into 
small cubes instead of long, thin slices. That way they’ll 
sit better on the bread. Set them aside and have them 
ready.
2) While you’re heating some olive oil in a pan, crush the 
garlic. To do this, peel the cloves apart and take off the 
?rst layer of peel (it’s usually already ?aking off). Turn the 
knife so that the ?at side is parallel to the cutting board, 
and use your palm to crush the clove. The clove should 
pop open, and the peel will have burst, making it easy to 
peel off. Slice the clove, and toss it into the olive oil with 
the onions.
3) After the onions have started cooking and are 
getting more tender, add the peppers and zucchini. Let 
everything stew for a bit, then add the spices. Taste the 
mix to see if you need more of something.
4) While the vegetables are cooking, melt some butter in 
another pan. When it’s melted, put the bread on top and 
lightly toast it on both sides. Don’t burn it!
5) When the bread is done toasting, put the cheese on 
top and set it aside. The cheese should melt slightly onto 
the bread, effectively sealing in the toasted ?avor and 
the crispy crust.
6) Taste the vegetables to see if they’re cooked. 
Everything should be tender and spiced appropriately. 
Add the tomatoes at the last minute and stir them 
around with everything else. By saving them for last, you 
can make sure that they won’t fall apart on you.
7) When everything is done, use a slotted spoon to spoon 
the veggies onto the bread. You can go back with the 
leftover bread later and sop up the juices. Ta-dah!

Given the creeping presence of cold weather and in anticipation of 
Pittsburgh’s upcoming winter freeze, students have been enjoying 
what’s left of the warmth. Juggling is one activity that can be moved 
inside in the coming months, but the satisfaction of reading a good 
book on the Cut with the sun in your hair will soon become nothing 
more than a fond memory.
goodbye, summer.
