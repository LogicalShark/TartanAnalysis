rest, its still not too late to get 
your ticket for tonight, and if this 
reviewer knows anything about 
revues (pun), it’s certainly worth 
any man’s money.
Those who remember the two 
previous Scotch and Soda shows 
will find that "One on the House” 
is much more interestingly and 
conveniently arranged. Instead of 
the four or five acts of the previ­
ous shows, there are two acts, 
each with lots of short numbers. 
And the numbers are either musi­
cal numbers—song and dance, etc. 
—or they are skits. There is no 
awkward combination of both, 
with the singer leaving the situa­
tion and coming down front to 
sing a song not too much connect­
ed with the business at hand. Wc 
find that the show moves faster 
this way, and that it has a lot 
more—well—iimph.
As a result of using so many 
more acts, and so much shorter 
acts, Director A1 Segal has had 
a hard task before him. It is. eas­
ier to put five nets together than 
it is to rehearse and coordinate 
and contrast seventeen. I don’t 
know who else could have done 
this so well, and certainly no one 
could have done it any better, 
The show runs smoothly, every­
thing fits together, and, whether 
A1 Segal has any hair or nerves 
left or not, he is to be heartily 
congratulated and given the of­
ficial Tech Oscar for successful 
direction.

Generally, the only thing camp­
us revues really have to recom­
mend them is the fact that sev­
eral of the school's brawniest 
males put on a shocking amount 
of stage make-up, yellow wigs, 
and what they fondly think is a 
falsetto voice, and cavort through 
the show as a “cutie chorus” and 
"romantic feminine lead.s”
Now you take Tech (as a great 
many of you have, for better or 
for worse) and take it with no 
strings and take it straight and— 
whoa! What we meant to say was, 
here at Tech, a campus revue is a 
different matter entirely. What 
with music students writing and 
playing the music, and costume 
ec’s designing and making the 
costumes and P&D’s designing the 
sets and physics majors and elec­
trical engineers and a dram at or 
two on lights, and a few stray en­
gineers and printers hammering 
away at the sets, not lo mention 
the dramals, who do the acting, 
you’ve got what differs from a 
professional show only in that It 
As as gay and as happily disre­

Wins in 
Of Editors
Confirming what everyone 
guessed, only with unexpected 
emphasis, college editors recent­
ly went to the polls for Billboard 
magazine and voted Glenn Miller’s 
orchestra the most popular band 
with America’s collegians.
Glenn piled up a total vote 
three times the size of his nearest 
competitor, record domination in 
the field. He had a total vote of 
251. Last year, in a similar poll, 
Glenn netted one vote.
This doesn’t do anything to 
;olve the swing vs. sweet situa- 
ion about which everyone has a 
:heory. Glenn can handle either;f
the only moral to be drawn 
3m the voting is that college 
ople like Glenn Miler. 
Naturally, they’re not alone. 
>ng known as a musician’s musi- 
ian, Miller had a great reputa- 
ion with the band men them- 
elves before "Moonlight Seren- 
ide” made the public Miller-con- 
icious.
Glenn played in bands with mu- 
icians like Tommy ani. Jimmy 
Dorsey, Benny Gooctman, Gene 
Crupa and Bix Bciderbeeks before 
•tt.ing out on his own. Even af-

mind to form his own band, it

Everyone connected with 
show can have my Oscar, as a 
matter of fact,...the well-re­
hearsed chorus dances not only 
with skill, but with Imagination; 
the cast of the skits; the design­
ers and all those hard working, 
little known technical people, and 
the smooth, easy playing of the 
band would never let you think 
they worked as hard as they have

Women’s G uild 
Elects Staff 
For New Year
Benefit Earnings 
Of Past Year 
Are Disbursed
New officers for the Carnegie 
Women’s Guild were chosen for 
the year 1940-41, Jane Hathaway, 
'41, was elected President; Elaine 
Roscnzweig, ’41, Secretary; Eve 
Rabban, ’43, Treasurer, and Nor­
ma Squiteri, ’42, Isabelle Gup, ’42, 
and Vida 1-Iirsch, ’42, the three 
Vice-Presidents.
The puiT30.se of the Guild is to 
"unite the women’s organizations 
on the campus in an effort to raise 
funds to support and carry on 
either wholly or partially the 
work of some charitable enter­
prise, and to provide funds for 
scholarships lo be given to women 
of the Art school and Margaret 
Morrison on the basis of ability, 
character, and need.” The money 
used comes from campus benefits. 
The Guild also receives a small 
profit from the candy machines 
that they installed in the women’s 
dormitories this year.
Members of the Guild are rep 
resenlatives from each dormitory 
and sorority, each departmental 
club, each of the women’s honor- 
aries, and the freshman class.
This year the benefits were in 
the form of two tag days on No­
vember 14 and April 23, a dance' 
held on February 23, and a party 
at Whitfield Plall on April 20. 
From the money received, $400 
was given to Dean Green for 
scholarship grants, $25 was sent 
to the Brashear Settlement for 
Christmas, and $25 was deposited 
in the Dean’s personal fund.
The purpose of the Dean’s per 
sonal fund is to supply loans to 
students who lack enough money 
for lunch or car-fare for a week 
or so. Money is deposited each 
year in this fund by the Guild to 
help needy students.

Jitterbugs Go 
Back To Nature
Our grapevine, after having 
gone underground for the cold 
spell, winds itself out of a crack in 
the sidewalk to inform us that, for 
the first time so far as it knows, 
they’re having dancing outside, in 
front of the Arts Building during 
Spring Carnival.
This alarms us no end. The ob­
vious thought is, what if it rains. 
But the, if the campus jitterbugs 
are at their best, the rain will dry 
up as soon as it hits the boor! 
Sssssl
Then, too, wc can't see why 
they-vo chosen the Arts Building. 
Wc can understand swinging and 
swaying outside of Engineering
Hall...if the physics majors will
play a Deana Durbin record one 
hundred and forty-five times for 
some eort of test,- we don’t j3ut it 
past them to hire Glenn Miller for 
the sole purpose of testing the vi­
brations in one square foot of 
shagged-on cement.
Carnival Is Relaxing After 
Mad Struggle for Tickets
By Joanne Tishlarisli
“Struggle and strain” was last 
week’s refrain as Carnival time 
drew near; yes, we struggled for 
that choice seat to Scotch and So­
da so that we wouldn’t have to 
peer past too many young ladies’ 
spring creations to get a glimpse 
of the show.
Like the typical slacker and 
shirker from a dreaded duty, I 
took plenty of time to saunter 
over to the Administration build­
ing. After all, I figured that un­
selfishness was the best of all vir­
tues, and I wanted to give the men; 
in the fraternities time to buy 
their huge blocks of the best 
seats in Carnegie Music Hall. Why 
should I have a seat in the m»?Jle 
of the first balcony or fi/sf row 
and prevent some poor unsuspect­
ing frat man from sitting with his 
own clique? V
So that you won’t lyt anyone 
put anything over on j(ou in fu­
ture years—I am goind to give 
you some advice taken (from my 
own sad experiences. Tne price 
of the three tickets is $M.25, and
I wish to emphasize the iiet that 
"three” is a very importaito num­
ber. You can't get in all three 
events with only one ticket.
After sprucing up my appear­
ance and bolstering my cclirage 
with my Athletic card that iVoves 
beyond the shadow of a iloubt 
that I am a "stoogent,” I maiVjied 
over to Administrations. I made' 
hasty search of the building, bi 
due to a premonition, was nt 
too disappointed to find no sale.^ 
men in my vicinity.
Instead I repaired to Skibo ai
the Beanery where (lucky dog) I 
found a member of the Carnival 
Committee. This was the time for 
a clear head, steady nerves, and 
a good disposition. My commit­
teeman (notice the possessive 
tone) told me that the only seats 
left were those which viewed ap­
proximately one-third of the 
stage. With an inborn wisdom I 
decided to take what I could get 
when I could get it. Otherwise 
I might find myself staring all 
evening at a beautiful stretch of 
^tapestry from which sound would 
emit at intervals.
As I put my hand in my pocket, 
the sudden realization came over 
me that I had forgotten to bring 
the correct amount of pecunia 
with mo. As the committeeman 
eyed me suspiciously I made a 
dash for the nearest exit. Once 
outside, 1 looked into my wallet 
where I found the necessary $5.25.
Good luck. Where are you? I 
knew I would need it to find that 
Man again. This time was harder 
than the last, since the salesmen 
had to resort to drink to drown 
the boredom of their jobs. With a 
prayer on my lips, I managed to 
corner another worthy individual 
within the short space of three 
hours.
No hesitation was present this 
time, as I grabbed the ticket and 
paid for it pronto.
This fuss might have been 
avoided if 1 had known a friend 
of a friend OF a friend who had 
bought a ticket. Then I could 
have assumed an alias and passed 
under the tolerant eye of the tick- 
et-taker.
No Sleep!
A1 Segal 
Plugs at Show
It was one of those nights when 
everyone had quizzes to study for, 
or finals due, or themes, or some­
thing, and no one showed up on 
crew to paint the scenery for 
"One on the House.” It was get­
ting near show-time, and work 
had to be done. So black-haired, 
hollow-eyed director Al Segal 
look off his coat, took a brush, 
and went to work.
Which is what your English in­
structor would probably call an 
illustrative anecdote—illustrating 
in this case that Al Segal is a 
director who is willing to do any­
thing to make his show the suc­
cess it now is. Ever since Scotch 
and Soda began on this year’s 
show, and the board appointed Al 
director, he has been tossing all 
thoughts of sleep and time for 
meals and personal convenience 
to the winds. (No plug for the 
Scarlet O’Hara skit in “One on 
the House.”)
Directing a revue means you’ve 
got to know something about 
everything that’s going on—music, 
dancing, skits, sets, costumes, 
publicity, business and unclassifi- 
able details. And if you haven’t 
made a hundred enemies by the 
time you’re through, you’re mirac­
ulous. Al hasn’t made any enem­
ies. Get it? What’s more, he’s got­
ten together the best show Tech 
has had yet.
Savoyards Give 
Final Operetta
Biology Prof Is 
In “Ruddigore” Cast
On Wednesday and Thursday 
nights, May 15 and 16, at the 
Twentieth Century Club, the Pitts­
burgh Savoyards will present 
"Ruddigore,” one of the Gilbert 
and Sullivan operas. The produc 
tion will be co-directed by Dr. 
Harvey B. Gaul and John H. Weis- 
brod, assisted by Alexander Rob 
ertson and J. A. Fellow. The ac 
companist will be Julia Jarvaise.
The subtitle of the opera is "The 
Witch’s Curse.” Many genera­
tions before the action of the opera 
takes place, a Baronet of Ruddi­
gore condemned a witch to death. 
As she died she cursed him and his 
family line, condemning each 
Baronet to commit a sin a day or 
die horribly. The opera’s plot re­
volves around the efforts of Rutli- 
ven, the present Baronet of Ruddi­
gore, to escape the curse.
He has lied his Baronetcy, leav­
ing his brother, who thinks him 
dead, to serve as Baronet in his 
stead, while he lives incognito as 
Robin, a farmer, near a small Eng­
lish village.
There are several interesting se­
quences in the plot. One of these 
occurs when the portraits of Ruth- 
ven’s ancestors conic to life and 
upbraid him for seeking to escape 
the curse.
Dances of the period—the ga­
votte. the hornpipe, the mazurka 
—are interspersed throughout the 
score. The tune of action is early 
nineteenth century.
The savoyards are completing 
with this production their first sea­
son of Gilbert and Sullivan pro­
ductions. The organization is a 
non-profit one, and membership is 
open to all who enjoy play pro­
duction or singing.
Facultv Loses 
Two Members
Profs. Riggs, Ely 
To Leave In June
Two veteran faculty members 
of the College of Engineering will 
retire at the conclusion of the 
college year. They are Prof. Nor­
man C. Riggs, head of the depart­
ment of mechanics, and Prof. 
Sumner B. Ely, of the department 
of mechanical engineering, who is 
also in charge of the Tech power 
plant. Both will receive retire­
ment benefits through the school.
Professor Riggs joined the Tech 
faculty in 1908. He is the author 
of “Applied Mechanics,” and col­
laborated with M. M. Froeht to 
edit "Strength of Materials,” both 
widely used textbooks.
Professor Ely came to Tech in 
1920 after considerable industrial 
engineering experience. Professor 
Ely is also the author of numer­
ous articles in technical journals 
and has given many public ad­
dresses. His hobby is legerdemain, 
and he has mystified and delight­
ed numerous audiences.
The two retiring professors 
were guests of honor at a dinner 
of the faculty of the.-College of 
Engineering last Friday evening at 
the Carnegie Inn. Dr. J. C. Warner 
presided.

its twentieth anniversary.
Jack Teagarden Will Play 
For Happy Carnival Crowd
itframtlRw KtowfaeIt’s easy to say that so and so 
is the world’s greatest on a cer­
tain instrument. Sometimes it 
means something, sometimes not. 
However, when one of the out­
standing instrumentalists in the 
world says so about a rival on 
the same instrument, then it car­
ries enormous value. In short, 
take the word of Tommy Dorsey 
about Jack Teagarden, whose or­
chestra will play for the Satur- 
•day night dance of Spring Carni­
val.
When Tommy and Jack were 
making the record date with the 
famous All-Star Band which in­
cluded such names as James, 
Goodman, Krupa, Haggart, Zurke, 
Ellman, and Barnett, Benny 
Goodman chided Dorsey about a 
solo. Tommy refused, and kid- 
dingly said: “Teagarden here, he 
is the best swing man ... I play 
cute and pretty ...” And he 
sure was right for Jack is the 
outstanding swing slip-horn man 
in the country.
Has Musical Family
Jack is not the only musician 
in the Teagarden family. Both 
his mother and father were ac­
complished musicians, brother

est trumpet players,, .is with Paul

Engineers Get 
Neiv Sidewalk
After months of pleading and 
threatening, the gardeners at Car­
negie Tech have decided that they 
are licked. Last week they began 
to erect a walk between Engineer­
ing hall and Industries hall.
Several months ago the care­
takers put up signs begging 
“Please” at each end of the for­
bidden walk. However the stu­
dents, ever willing to disregard au­
thority, interpreted the sign as re­
questing them to use the forbid­
den path.
Construction of the walk has 
been hampered during the last 
week by rain but weather permit­
ting, the walk will be ready for 
use in the next week or two.

Editorials
On Tuesday evening’ the out­
going Student Council voted to 
disapprove the new TARTAN 
staff. The new staff was not noti­
fied of any charges against it nor 
was it invited to be present at the 
meeting. Student Council made no 
provision for the two remaining 
issue of the TARTAN, so that the 
disapproved staff feels that it lias 
no alternative but to continue the 
work of getting the news to the 
students.
However, due to Student Coun­
cil’s action, the stall feels that it 
no longer has the right to present 
an editorial column.
Therefore, with the exception 
of this explanation, the TARTAN 
will carry no editorials for the re­
mainder of the semester.
ONE OF THE BOYS
For four years Bernard Lebovit 
has been at Carnegie, and for four 
years he has been “one of the

he is known to the gals and pals,

After much discussion and 
campaigning the. men's dormitor- 
Vies were to be built at last. Di­
rector I-Iammerschlag had ar­
ranged for the construction of two 
buildings, each to house one hun­
dred students. The dorms were 
to. be “comfortable, hygienic, and 
democratic.”
There would be no “rich-man” 
or “poor-man” units. Each student 
v/ould be free to come and go as j 
he pleased. Carnegie depended on 
the “discretion and sense of pro­
portion” of each resident to gov­
ern him.
The Radio Club heard Willard 
put the “kibosh” on Johnson in 
the 26th round on their experi­
mental receiving set. This set was 
built from odds and ends brought 
in by the members.

plained of the high cost of food 
in the so-called non-profit cafe­
terias on campus.

Lillian Rest -Home, the Women’s 
Guild was to hold a carnival on 
the folowing Wednesday. Fortune 
telling, a fashion show, and a taxi 
dance were planned. Pictures of 
professors were to be hung on the 
¦vyalls, and students could throw 
three baseballs at the faces for 
live cents.
Lottie Collins, who made famous 
that “haunting” melody, “Ta Ra 
Ha Boom De Aye,” was scheduled 
to hold a premier in Pittsburgh at 
the Davis Theater the following 
week.
At the University of Illinois 
students petitioned the faculty for 
a return to old-style dancing, the 
two-step and waltz instead of the 
riotous now steps.

Canoe Tilting 
On Saturday
Saturday morning from 11 to 12 
will find plenty of activity* around 
Panther Hollow when the annual 
Spring Carnival canoe tilting con­
test will be held. This year there 
is a fairly good representation of 
teams, for to date there have been 
ten entered. Before the deadline 
more entries will undoubtedly fol­

No. 4 Problem of the Bookworm. 
Three volumes, numbered I, II, 
and III, are placed in order on a 
shelf. Each volume contains two 
hundred pages, which are num­
bered from one to six hundred, 
inclusive, through the three vol­
umes. The pages are 0.01 inch 
thick, and each of the two covers 
of each book is one-eighth of an 
inch thick. There are no unnum­
bered pages, no bookmarks, no 
airspaces, etc., within or between 
the books.
A bookworm begins his life 
with his mandibles touching page 
29!), and eats his way forward in 
a straight line perpendicular to the 
pages as far as page one. If the 
areo of cross-section ol! the animal 
is 0.01 square inch, what volume 
has he consumed?
It is hoped that the reader will 
not take this problem too lightly, 
for its simplicity is exceeded only 
by its treachery, For this reason 
it is desirable to have some means 
of determining whether or not the 
answer obtained is correct with­
out actually learning what; the an­
swer Is. For this purpose the in­
formation Is supplied, that if the 
answer Is expressed in ten-thou-

After several years on the coast 
he went to New York, working 
with Paul Ash, Red Nichols, Fred­
dy Rich, the Dorsey Brothers and 
Ray Noble. He began to form his 
first band while working with Ray 
Noble, keeping an eye out for mu­
sicians whose work he liked.
While working for Ray Noble, 
Glenn first hit on the instrument­
al arrangement which gives his 
orchestra its character: the saxo­
fones. The saxofones consist of a 
five-man sax section, in itself 
highly unusual, in which a clari­
net takes the lead, playing a full 
octave above the tenor sax, with 
the three other saxes filling out 
the harmony.

ting the paper to bed.” Being a 
key man on the Debate Team, 
founder and chairman of the 
Bard, and President of Pi Delta 
Epsilon, did not quench his energy. 
He wrote several essays which 
won prizes in competition and has 
even completed the writing of a 
book.
“Behind the Type,” by Bernard 
Lebovit, is being published by the 
Printing Department this year, 
most of the printing work being 
under Bernie’s supervision.
Not only “book larnin’ ” sub­
jects occupied his time, but he 
earned his numerals in cross coun­
try, competed in track, probably 
developing his stride when he 
covered the campus for news.
Plans for the, future include 
some books of fiction and the pos­
sibility of doing advertising, copy- 
writing or newspaper work. Lilce 
most newspaper men he finds him­
self where the action is greatest, 
although he terms himself a 
“peaceful person.”
Bernie believes that, “During 
the last several years some pro­
gressive changes and additions 
have been made on the campus, 
but if American involvement in 
the war does not negate all else 
by next year, progress should be 
greater than in past years.”
For hobbies Bernie devotes his 
time to collecting books, especially 
unusually printed books. Those 
odd seconds that he does find, he 
listens to records from his sym­
phonic collections. On his vaca­
tions he is bitten by the “camera 
bug.” He taught Arts & Crafts at 
summer camps for five years.

is just one of thousands of experienced 
smokers who have discovered that Camel’s 
slower way of burning means several definite 
advantages. Being slower-burning, Camels are 
free from the drying, uncomfortable qualities 
of excess heat.They give you o-fat IA)mnoww and 
o-fat pee)noww... always so welcome. Slower
burning makes the most of the full, rich flavor 
of Camel’s costlier tobaccos. Camels give you 
o-fat ’)tTea... don’t tire your taste. The extra 
smoking in Camels is a matter of the smokers’ 
experience as well as of impartial laboratory 
record. So get more pleasure per puff and more 
puffs per pack. Get Camels. Penny for penny, 
Camels are your best cigarette buy!
T Though firms come to the cam­
pus to interview senior men, and 
a number of seniors are employed 
by this method, there are those 
who, by the time for graduation, 
still do not have a job.
This is not a discouraging fact, 
because many inquiries are usual­
ly received after graduation. For 
the individual senior the problem 
is. to broaden his contacts; it is a 
matter of his own effort. Follow­
ing are a few suggestions as to 
ways of obtaining the names of 
firms, their addresses and list of 
offices:
In the Bureau of Recommenda­
tions may be found inquiries, firm 
file, and a list of companies oI“ 
ploying Tech graduates.
In the libraries may be found 
directories of various industries, 
such as a Directory of Iron and 
Steel, etc.; Directory of Directors 
which is published in many large 
cities; a list of manufacturers as 
prepared by the Chamber of Com­
merce in various cities; Poor’s 
Register of Directors; Moody’s 
Manual, and Standard Statistics.
Other helpful sources of em­
ployment suggestions are Dun and 
Bradstreets, which has offices lo­
cated in larger cities; the tele­
phone directory, and newspapers.
If the company is located in the 
city, call for an appointment; if 
it is out of town, write. Sugges­
tions on letter writing may be ser 
cured in the Bureau of Recom­
mendations.

Pictured above is the Radio Club’s new illustrated azimuthal map which is to be syn­
chronized with the recently erected directional antenna. Lighted sections of the map indicate 
the exact range the beam is covering. Inside the map and the control unit there are fifty-five 
electric light lamps with 1,500 feet of wire. This special type of map shows the shortest distance 
to any point. Thus if it is desired to "work” China the map indicates that the beam should 
by pointed somewhat west of north. When the lights behind China flash on, the waves are go­

Letter ...
Editor of the Tartan:
For years now, I have been 
waiting for the TARTAN to start 
an investigation of the school cafe­
terias. It seems to me that it is 
quite obvious that the prices of 
the food are far too high for such 
a low quality of food in the sup­
posedly non-profit making cafe­
terias on the campus. In a dining 
car, not a mile from campus, a 
baked ham sandwich (for exam­
ple) may be purchased for $.15 
with, if the truth be told, too much 
ham enclosed between the two 
slices of bread. This price a 
includes tomato and crisp lettuce. 
On the other hand we have the 
Beanery, where one slice of ham, 
shaved off with a razor for thin, 
ness, is placed between two slices 
of usually stale bread, a leaf of 
wilted lettuce and a slice or two 
of tomato are added and sold for
the price of $.20. Remember that 
the above diner pays rent or taxes 
and buys in small quantities while 
the “Beanery” pays no taxes and 
the saving in buying of large quan­
tities of food at a time should re­
duce the cost (if I learned my 
Economics). If the help is paid 
well, they certainly don’t show it 
by interest in seeing that you get 
waited on. I have waited two or 
three minutes during slack 
while three or four of the girls 
discussed spring styles or some 
other important matter.
I went to high school here in 
the city, where any dish was a 
nickel. These cafeterias were also 
non-profit making, but even at 
these prices, they were able to 
show a small profit at the end of a 
year.
Supposing the cafeterias are 
supposed to make a profit. Is it 
necessary that so great a profit be 
made at the expense of the health 
of the students?
Recently I asked a member of 
Student Council if something 
couldn’t be done; he suggested I 
write a letter to the TARTAN since
you could publish a letter while 
not definitely committing yourself 
on the issue and thereby causing 
yourself some trouble with the ad­
ministration.

Mr. Frank Eyman, head of the

Home To Tech
The Tartan netmen met with 
disheartening defeat in their first 
match of the season on the Ski- 
bo courts. Then Penn State 
racketeers defeated our men eight 
matches to one, after the open­
ing tilt which the Tartan won 
with ease. However, this set­
back didn’t discourage the Tech 
courtiers, and they came out on 
top in the Grove City contest by 
a count of five to one. With their 
first victory under their bells the 
boys were looking forward to a 
three day trip making stops at 
Geneva on May 2, Allegheny on 
May 3, and Westminster on May 
4, but the rains came and the 
trip was a washout. On May 6. 
the Tartans have a scheduled 
match with the men from Geneva, 
and they have a very good chance 
to add another victory to their 
lists of conquests.
There is a renewed interest in 
tennis on the Tech campus, and 
this is a stimulus to better tennis 
teams. Heretofore, the Techmen 
have always been rather weak op­
position for the other schools in 
the league, but this year strength­
ened by many new members, our 
team has a good chance to break 
the Skibo jinx and bring home 
a few laurels. More encouraging 
even than the status of the pres­
ent team is the lai’ge number of 
Freshmen reserves that have tried 
out for the squad this year.
The Scottish lads are very even­
ly matched in their practice 
games, and it Would be unfair to 
mention a small group as the 
nucleus of the team. If you would 
like to spend an interesting hour 
or two, drop down to the courts 
and watch the boys in action.
THISTLEDOWN
NINE BUGGIES ENTER CARNIVAL RACE
- ¦ ¦ By Bill Floyd? Sports Editor —
Buggies Start To Roll
Bud Wilson, super cliiel! oi this year’s Spring Carnival, Jiasj 
announced that more fraternities have entered pushmobiles in 
tin; 1940 Carnival than ever before in the history of our institu­
tion. The sum total of buggies entered in this colossus of races 
aiow rests al; nine.
'in past years, in fact for the last five years of Carnival 
history, the sweepstakes event has been annexed by Kappa Sigs. 
However, this year the.many new entries and numerous improve- 
inents made in the regular contenders has given ample proof to 
the Clyde Streeters that this year’s race will be far from a walk 
away.
Many of the.club, in preparation for the event, appear each 
morning al; six, and proceed to run over the designated course. 
Friday morning some time around this early hour, Harold Cole 
and the so-called “mystery buggy” of the T)U’s were rolling 
down the hill in front of the gym. Due to some physical force, 
unknown to most Freshmen, this faithful charge began to pick 
up speed as it sped down yon grade. Those of you who are at 
all familiar with' the Tech campus can immediately picture the 
sharp curve at the foot of this elevation . . . Sir Cole forgot 
about the curve. The result oil this unfortunate lapse of memory 
can easily be seen by looking at Master Cole who now sports a 
new layer of iodine over his many scraps and bruises.
Red Wind’s Bum Knee
One of the potential stalwarts of next year’s gridiron ma­
chine is Big Walter Wind. During his initial year in the In­
stitute Handsome Reddy was considered to be All-American 
material. However, fate in the form of a torn cartilage stepped 
in and rudely jolted our friend and all his admirers. Unfor­
tunately for Red and Carnegie, his knee has been bothering him 
for the past three years.
In another attempt to recondition this constant affliction, 
Red last week visited one of the foremost osteopaths in the city. 
According to the latest reports Marse Wind’s trouble maker is 
responding to the applied treatment. If the treatment is as 
successful as we all hope it is Doc Baker will have one less 
position to worry about next year.
Petition Waring for School Song
Despite the fact that Carnegie has some of the best school 
songs in the country, I can’t help but wonder why it is that no 
Tartan organization has petitioned Fred Waring and his organ­
ization to write a song for young Skibo. Even if we don’t need 
the song a little publicity over a nation-wide radio hook-up 
could do no harm. Maybe Eddie Bankson and his Alpha Phi 
Omega boys could be induced to conduct such a campaign,'may­
be not. At any rate, I still think it would be interesting to 
hear about our school in words and music during next year’s 
football season.
Softball Predictions
’Tis a risky business, but maybe today is “Risk Day” on 
the Tech campus, anyhow regardless of what day, time, or 
position, the Tartan Sports staff is now making their annual 
prediction as to the Carnegie Softball Champion. From what 
we’ve seen in our wandering the past two weeks, we take the 
once beaten Phi Kaps.

We can see them from the top 
of Schenley hill; they are almost 
around the final turn now, and 
coming fast. Pretty Skibo las­
sies and their slide-rule-bred es­
corts are running helter-skelter; 
the crowd is increasing with the 
speed of a geometric progres­
sion, and the noise is beginning 
to play havoc with the ear drums. 
The last change has been made 
and they are in the final stretch. 
It is impossible to hold the crowd 
back; the judges are the only ones 
who seem to be somewhere near 
sane. And now they are approach­
ing the finish line, none holding 
the advantage. But suddenly 
showing a final burst of speed, the 
buggy, amid the wild cheers of 
its sympathizers, breaks the tape 
in victory.
And the above description
should not be far wrong. Always 
a thrilling Carnival, the annual 
pushmobile race of this year will 
undoubtedly top all past perform­
ances. Of the nine buggies enter­
ed in the contest, three will make 
their initial appearance, and the 
others will probably show some 
radical changes. With the rela­
tive speeds of the buggies un- 
konwn, no one would dare pre­
dict the outcome of the race. Re­
spectively in first and second place 
last year, the Kappa Sigma and 
Delt buggies will not be much 
changed. With the entrance of 
new buggies from Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon, Delta Upsilon, and Phi 
Kappa, these recordholders will 
have to look to their laurels. And, 
unless they have their pushers on 
roller skates again, the Pi Kappa 
Alpha craft will be after that 
coveted speed trophy.

After dropping four matches, 
the luckless Tartan golfers fin­
ished the toughest part of their 
schedule last Monday. On April 
29 the Skibo linksmen lost a tough 
engagement to a scrappy Grove 
City outfit by a 6-3 count at the 
Pittsburgh Field Club. Paul Love- 
day and George Tondorf were the 
only Tartans to come through with 
individual victories, while Ton- 
dorf and John Shymowsky teamed 
up to win the-best ball match for 
their foursome, netting Tech’s 
third point.
The following day the Plaid pill, 
chasers journeyed to Ncmolin 
Country Club to meet Washington 
and JolTerson’s highly touted ag­
gregation. The Slclbos revamped 
their line-up for this match in an 
olTort to upset the dope, but the 
W and J men turned on the heat, 
taking every point to win 9-0.
On Thursday, in a semi-drizzle, 
the touring Scots met the Geneva 
club wielders on the Geneva home 
course. Harry Sacks, playing in 
the number six spot, was the only 
local linksman to bring home the 
bacon, winning his match one-up 
to save the Plaid from another 
goose egg on the score sheet.

high schools girls to get an idea of 
what Tech is and does, and to 
meet one another. The plans are 
to be carried out as the play-day 
that was so sadly canceled last 
month, and this being the last ac­

will work for a complete suc-
At times we wonder just where 
the days go, but hero we are mak­

rushed through on the W. A. A.

In the Union on May 10. At this 
time those girls who have received

these girls being In their Junior

The first thing to be observed is 
that the word “page” is conven­
tionally used in two senses; there 
are of course two numbered pages 
to each single page, or sheet, of 
thickness 0.01 inch. In the sec­
ond place, when the books are in 
order the pages are NOT in order, 
for the backs of the books will 
be toward the observer, so that 
page one in the first volume will 
be nearest page 400 in the second 
volume.
In going from page 299 to page 
300 the worm penetrates one 
sheet, as is easily seen, and in pro­
ceeding from page 300 to page 400 
he penetrates 50 additional sheets, 
making 0.51 inches so far. To 
reach page one he now has only 
to eat his way through the two- 
book-covers, of combined thick­
ness 0.25 inches, making 0.76 
inches in all. Multiplying the 
lenght of the hole just found by its 
area of cross-section, 0.01 square 
inch we get 0.0076 cubic inches, 
if the writer hasn’t overlooked any 
thing. Perhaps someone would be 
kind enough to verify this exper­
imentally.
Frosh Architects, 
ATO’s, Sigma Nu’s 
Win Decisive Games
Delta Tau Delta, the Transfers, 
and the Citcom Clan softball 
squads led the parade last week 
by each racking up two victories 
in as many days.
On Monday, April 30 the Delts 
eked out a narrow one-run victory 
over the powerful SAE aggrega­
tion by a 9-8 count. The ATOs 
were the victims of another one- 
tally defeat at the hands of the 
Delts on Tuesday. The Transfers, 
who now stand out as one of the 
strongest teams in their league, 
downed the Welch - Henderson 
combine by a 1-3 margin, and then 
came back with a forfeit triumph 
over the Metallurgists to keep 
their slate clean.
mMwmd; -Mag 
Also turning in a pair of wins 
on Monday and Tuesday, the Cit- 
con Clan, another power in the 
Independent Leagues, knocked off 
Scobell Hall, 13-6, and then 
turned in a victory over the Mu­
sic Department squad by a 17-3 
count. The Clan has not yet been 
beaten on the softball diamond.
Other games on Monday found 
the Freshman Architects taking 
the measure of McGill Hall, by a 
narrow 5-4 score. The ATOs 
downed the Betas, who beat the 
Delts in the opening game of the 
season, by a decisive 15-9 margin. 
The Senior Engineers dropped an­
other game by the forfeit route 
when they failed to present a full 
team for their contest with the 
Freshman Engineers. The Fresh­
men of Section 8 made it a gen­
erally good day for the under­
classmen by topping the Chem 
Engineers, 13-8.
gM:;l a3 -Mag
After dropping their last game 
because of an illegal pitch ruling 
against fire-ball tosser, George 
Muha, the Sigma Nus came back 
with a 12-7 triumph over Beta 
Sigma Rho to put themselves back 
in the running. Theta Xi turned 
in a neat' 12-7 verdict over the 
Tau Delts.
Tuesday afternoon found the 
softball fields crowded again as 
the Tau Delts dropped their sec­
ond decision in two days, this time 
bowing to the Betas by a 12-5 
count. The Beta Sigs bounced back 
from their defeat at the hands of 
the Sigma Nu men to beat the 
DUs, 20-12., The Freshman Archi­
tects joined the ranks of the dou­
ble victors by following up their 
win over McGill with a 7-1 tri­
umph at the expense of Scobell 
Hall.
Next Monday will be the last 
meeting of the year, and the new 
managers will be elected for the 
coming year. Also, the success of 
the conferences nttondod recently 
will bo estimated, and the girls 
will explain just what benefit was 
received. This news will bo 
printed for all those interested,in 
seeing just what good is received 
from these weekends at other col­
leges. It seems some people do 
not understand that these confer­
ences ARE beneficial and add to 
education rather than social enter­
tainment.

Come see the buggy babies in 
the baby buggies. During Spring 
Carnival, a baby buggy relay race 
will be held with all sororities 
participating, and each contribut­
ing a buggy, three runners, and 
a baby ranging from eighteen 
years upward.. One girl with baby 
and buggy is to start in front of 
the “Beanery,” run up to Indus­
tries, where a second runner wall 
replace the first. The second 
stretch is from Industries to Art 
School, where the third runner 
will take over, and bring the bug­
gy to Maggie Murph, the end of 
the line, and, incidentally, of the 
race. Each baby must be equip­
ped with bonnet, bottle, and a 
rattle. The time is Saturday at 
two o’clock. Don’t fail to be there!
Freshman Golf 
Prospect Dim
The Frosh linkmen met with 
ignominious defeat last Wednes- 
at the hands of Shady Side Acad­
emy. The final totals for the 
match were fifteen points lor 
Shady Side and exactly no points 
for our plebes. ’
After suffering so decisive a de­
feat, the juniors were again forced 
to bow1 to Kiski to the tune of 
fourteen and one-half points. In 
view of* these two routs, it seems 
unlikely that the Tartan clubbers 
will have a very successful season.
Ward Duchene is playing the 
position o:f number one man . on 
the team, although his scores aVe 
not exceptional in league compe­
tition. It is possible that these 
Frosh recruits will improve with 
practice and prove that the first 
few matches of the season are not 
indicative of the brand of season 
performance.

no Intramural Rifle competition 
this year; the immense lack of in­

has been stated as the reason. In 
past years this sport has been en­
thusiastically supported by In­
dependent as well as Fraternity 
groups. Surely this year should 
be no exception. Though rifle is 
a minor sport, it has a large fol­
lowing and there are many who 
wotild like to see a little activity 
along this line.

Hold Annual 
Golf Tourney
Date and Course 
To Be Selected 
Ity Student Body
Fore! You guessed it! Spring is 
here so look out for the golf bug 
is ready to bite the boy friend.
On Saturday, May 25, 19-10, the 
Evening Student Council is sched­
uled to hold its 3rd Annual Golf 
Tournament. Last year’s Niblick 
brigade was played at Butler’s Golf 
Course, but the course for this 
year has as yet not been select­
ed.
Last year's Medal prize was 
won by Howard Meanor who shot 
an 80. Tabor Deklewa was second 
with an 82. Other scores ranged 
from 83 to 120. . Several worth­
while kickers’ prizes were also 
awarded. “Booby” prize was won 
by Jim Fisher, who promises 
strong opposition for the same 
prize this year.
Last year’s group tripled the 
first year’s and this year the com­
mittee hopes for a greater crowd. 
Because many who would like to 
play, work on Saturdays, the 
tournament may be staged on a 
Sunday morning. Those interest­
ed in playing should send in their 
name and address, preference of 
course, and the day, Saturday or 
Sunday, that they would like to 
play. There will be lots of 
prizes.
Applications should be sent to 
Stephen W. Marinizyn, Evening 
Student Council, Box 136, Car­
negie Institute of Technology. En­
try fee will be the greens fee.
Arts Adopts 
New Election 
Procedure
Fine Arts elections in the past 
have shown that only a small per­
centage of the eligible voter's cast 
a vote; therefore, in order to give 
every member of tne school a 
chance to vote, a new procedure 
is being introduced. Previously, 
at a gathering of the students, 
nominations and elections were 
held the same evening making it 
necessary for each student to be 
present l'or about three hours, in 
order to cast his vote. Under the 
new system, all nominations will 
be posted by 7:00 o’clock on the 
evening of the election and stu­
dents will cast their votes at any 
time between 7:00 and 10:00. This 
system eliminates the necessity of 
standing in line in order to vote, 
although, strangely enough, more 
voters will be attracted to the 
polls. You who have not voted 
in the past should take advantage 
of this convenient arrangement 
and utilize your valuable privilege 
of choosing your leaders.

Mothers are angels who are too 
busy to go to heaven.
Sunday we pause to celebrate 
the tenderest holiday of the year 
—Mother’s Day—It is the one day 
of the year which is not placed on 
the calendar to remind her oi 
some duty to perform for you. It 
restricted by nationality, for moth­
er love knows no racial lines, ten- 
is the only holiday which is not 
derness is not restricted by creed, 
and sacrifice is not limited by col­
or. The world’s greatest writers 
have tried for years to express the 
kindly reverence of this occasion 
with varying success. We can 
only envy those who have the 
ability to express themselves with 
words, and search for other means 
of showing our feelings.
Most of us are inclined to take 
for granted the every day kind­
ness which she bestows on us. 
We often fail to realize until too 
late how we failed to show our 
appreciation. So, on Sunday, if 
your mother is alive don’t fail to 
pay homage to her sincere af­
fection and kindness in some way. 
If you fail to do this, there is 
no excuse that will exonerate you. 
She has accepted your alibis all 
her life without reproach, but 
an alibi is not the remembrance 
she wants now. Your little gift 
will bring a smile to her lips and 
your presence will add years to 
her life. It isn’t much to ask 
for years of heartbreak and sac­
rifice, and those of us who will 
make our ways to cemeteries 
would grasp eagerly at such an 
opportunity.
officers of the Pitt and Duquesne 
Evening Student Associations to 
attend the Council Inter-College 
Dance May 4.
A discussion began on possible 
ways of improving elections. The 
most difficult problem is presented 
in the College of Fine Arts. Presi­
dent Marcinizyn suggested a meth­
od of stimulating more interest in 
school activities—to select with 
discretion the social committees of 
the three colleges so that every 
department on the campus would 
be represented. These committees 
would meet with the Evening Stu­
dent Council one or two weeks 
after the first Council meeting to 
discuss rules governing activities 
and Council, and the purpose of 
Council. The second meeting of 
that person which it deems most 
capaable, conscientious and deeply 
interested in the students’ welfare, 
as president of the Council for the 
following year. The Council 
elected as the 1940-41 President, 
Mr. James C. Fisher.
Discussion centered -about the 
Plaid Editor’s lack of co-operation 
during the whole year in turning 
over to Council the record of 
points earned by Plaid workers. 
Activity points, to be good, must 
be turned in and recorded within 
30 days. In the case of the Jlaid, 
points were to be turned in at the 
end of each month.
A STUDENT.
Report on regular meeting of 
Evening Student Council held 
Sunday, April 7, 1940, and special 
meeting held Thursday, April 3, 
1940.
President Marcinizyn read the 
letter received from Dr. Doherty 
regarding student activity, ma­
triculation and graduation fees, and 
the explanation that will appear 
in the 10'lO-'l 1 bulletin describing 
fees. Council accepteG the plan 
suggested in the letter to select a 
date such that students who grad­
uate within that time and who 
paid the matriculation fee prior to 
September, 1939, will not be re­
quired to pay a graduation fee. 
Because the degree course in 
Architecture is scheduled for 12 
years, but is seemingly impossible 
to finish within 15 years, 1953 was 
selected as the date.
Special meeting was held the 
evening before the Council-Fac- 
ulty Dinner to discuss questions to 
be brought up during the dinner. 
The dinner held in the Carnegie 
Inn on Thurcday evening, April
4, 1940, was a success and many 
valuable questions were discussed 
and settled. • ,
Report on the Dr. Baker Me­
morial showed that plans are al­
most complete.
In order to stimulate greater in­
terest between the governing 
bodies of the three City evening 
colleges, invitations were sent to
Extra Term Begins 
Following Monday
This is the time of year when 
students begin wondering whether 
or not they have paid enough at­
tention to dear teacher during 
the last four months or whether 
they’ll be hearing the same teach­
er in same lecture, same place 
next year. Exams, you know, be-, 
gin on May 20th—less than two 
weeks away. In case you’re good 
and get through per schedule, 
you’re ready to relax and enjoy 
the good old summer time on May 
25th. But for those courses you 
flunk, call around on May 27th

Letter To The Editor
Your once having been a Coun­
cil member definitely proves to 
you that one college, such as Fine 
Arts, cannot run Council, es­
pecially when the entire Council 
is present. To accuse Fine Arts 
of running Council would be a 
compliment to them, but no such 
laurels' go in their direction. Coun­
cil has never accused the Arts 
boys of running things and where 
you got the information is beyond 
me. The fact remains that when 
the Engineers selected a fellow 
officer to replace one lost by first 
semester’s grades, Arts “stood 
pat” by some not voting and 
others voting “no” when Council 
approval was asked in this selec­
tion. Because only ten members 
of Council w'ere present Arts suc­
cessfully blocked a majority vote, 
for which they were vigorously 
reprimanded by the Engineering 
president!
If the Arts College doesn’t like 
the wny things were run, or the 
outcome of the last election, you, 
Mr. Editor, know from past ex­
periences that the loser doesn't al­
ways lose lilce a gentleman, but 
often becomes a sorehead.
If you are at this time trying to 
support Fine Arts and appear 
"heroic” and the student-minded 
to the public, why haven’t you 
brought to the attention of the 
Arts students the fact that they 
are represented by lour 0Ulcers 
the same department but also 
have classes together throughout 
the week? Seems you’ve muff­
ed your chances of being a "re- 
1 former.”
In support of Mr. Fisher, the of­
ficers of Fine Arts helped to 
“unanimously elect” him as treas­
urer of Council because they 
thought he was the best person 
able to do the job. His nomina­
tion was made by Arts president. 
Any Council member of the last 
three years will agree with me 
that Mr. Fisher has the never 
campaigned for or solicited votes 
for himself. His has been the at­
titude "it’s up to them if they want 
me.”
Those who attended the election 
smokers, especially the Engineers, 
will remember that I vigorously 
denounced those persons who, 
even before election to Council 
this Fall, had planned on who 
would hold office and when. T am 
truly happy that neither of the two 
persons were successful for their's 
was not the interest of the students 
at heart.
T hope that some day sorehead- 
edness and potty jealousies can bo 
banished from this Campus and 
that the Editorial Stac of the,Plaid 
will actually give Council a "little 
edge.” After all, Council and the 
Plaid are both for the students’ 
interest.
Sincerely yours,
(s) STEPHEN W. MARCTNTZYN, 
President

Annual! Spring lottery - - - Who Will 
Editor If Evening Council Won’t?
-Once a year someone drops in­
to the staffroom to remind the 
editor that, after all, his salary 
for the year is paid through Eve­
ning Student Council, and that 
he had better mind his P’s and 
Q’s. Some day a PLAID editor 
will pay attention to the veiled 
threat and no student will ever 
know anything about the people 
who spend your activities fee ex­
cept what those people want you 
to know.
The implied threat of the salary 
check being withheld at the end 
of the year has never carried 
much weight for several rea­
sons. In the first place, the PLAID 
editor’s salary is paid out of the 
activities fees paid by the stu- 6470 Monitor St. HA. 0193
¿his. We suspect that even -
Council knows that the activities 
fee money is not intended to be 
used as a bribe to make the 
PLAID staff or any other group 
stooges to Council'.
Evening Student Council must 
also realize that the editor’s sal­
ary is not large enough for the 
editor to sell his soul over it. Some 
one has to keep track of Council’s 
activities, and it might as well be 
the PLAID, salary or no salary.
