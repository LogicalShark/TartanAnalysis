When did this campus decide to post 
signs that say, “No Happiness Al­
lowed?” It’s as if a black cloud flew 
over CMU and ordered everyone to 
their rooms, dooming them to solitude 
and never-ending homework.
Though we can’t change the Pitts­
burgh weather, we can challenge the 
negative attitudes that pervade our 
campus. If elected, we will abandon 
this pessimism by building pride in 
CMU; some of our ideas to encourage 
this new spirit include increasing 
awareness of the resources and oppor­
tunities available at CMU, acknowl­
edging academic and athletic achieve­
ments of students, and creating new 
possibilities for social activities.
At the end of Orientation 1996, the 
entire first-year class sat underneath 
the tent and listened to a fifth-year 
scholar who said, “Whenever you 
hear someone say, ‘CMU sucks,’ you 
must simply respond with one 
word — ‘Bullshit!’ ” Our goal is that 
when some apathetic person claims, 
“CMU sucks,” the entire campus 
will shout out, in one unified, power­
ful voice, “BULLSHIT!”
What will make us — the student 
body — stronger is the further devel­
opment of campus resources and the, 
increase of student satisfaction.
As the Academic Affairs chair of 
Student Senate, I worked with Bryon 
Krug to expand course information 
and improve academic advising. I 
worked to gather student opinion on 
the administration’s proposed policy 
changes, including the Statement of 
Academic Integrity, to ensure that 
these changes were consistent with 
student feelings. I made sure that the 
strong student opposition to the calen­
dar changes resulted in the reconsid­
eration of these changes.
Elayne and I want to continue to 
work for you to make sure that, when 
the administration asks for student 
opinion, they also ACT upon these 
concerns. Our past record has shown 
that we are capable and motivated. 
We are the only candidates who have 
experience leading the Student Gov­
ernment projects that have produced 
results benefiting all students.
Vote for the candidates who know 
how to get things done: vote for Amy 
and Elayne.

Senate studies course information
By DAN ARP
Tartan Contributing Editor
As part of an effort to make On-Line 
Registration a mpre comprehensive ser­
vice, Student Senate is pushing the ad­
ministration to make course informa­
tion more easily accessible to students. 
In a proposal released to Senate last 
Thursday, the Academic Affairs Com­
mittee and the Executive Branch of Stu-' 
dent Government recommended a two­
fold plan for improving CMU’s Web site 
on course information. The first part of 
the plan, which Senate wants the ad­
ministration to implement within the 
next two weeks (in time for fall 1998
registration), mainly involves centraliz­
ing information that is already avail­
able to students in other formats.
An example of this type of information 
would be faculty course evaluations 
(FCEs), which students fill out at the 
end of each semester. FCEs are avail­
able in paper form at various locations 
around campus and are also available 
through a very old interface on the An­
drew system. By consolidating this in­
formation into the course information 
• Web site already in place, students would 
have to do less legwork to find out about 
a course while registering.
“It wasn’t that this information wasn’t 
there — it just wasn’t centralized,” said
Bryon Krug, student body president and 
a senior electrical and computer engi­
neering major. “We’re hoping we’re going 
to be able to get some results right away.”
Whether students see these results or 
not is up to the administration. Though 
drafters of the proposal say they are 
optimistic the administration will work 
on revamping the Web site, no promises 
have been made. “I think that there’s 
definite administrative interest in this 
project and in assessing how feasible it 
would be to provide students the infor­
mation they clearly want,” said Krug.
The research behind the proposal 
should carry some weight with the ad-

Freshmen won’t have to deal with the 
quirks of Ezmail, MacMail, or the An­
drew Message System (AMS) when they 
arrive next fall. Instead, Computing 
Services has announced that the class of 
2002 will be placed on the Cyrus mailing 
system. Cyrus will eventually be 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus-wide replace­
ment for the older AMS.
“A transition to a new mail system for 
a community-as large as ours cannot 
happen overnight,” said Tracy Futhey, 
executive director of Computing Services. 
“With well over 13,000 active users of 
AMS, we believe it is better for the indi­
viduals and for the University as a whole
if that transition is made over time.”
Even though all freshman will be on 
Cyrus, current students and faculty will 
not be required to make the switch to the 
new system. According to Futhey, Com­
puting Services will continue to support 
Ezmail, and MacMail will still be sup­
ported for at least several more years.
Most freshmen, however, will be in­
troduced to Mulberry, a mail client that 
uses Cyrus, much like Ezmail and 
MacMail use AMS. Last February, Com­
puting Services also recommended Mul­
berry for current Cyrus users over 
Simeon and Outlook Express, two other 
IMAP mail clients.
“The current version of Mulberry (ver­
sion 1.3) offers most of the key function­
ality that has long been available in
AMS clients,” said Futhey. “For ex­
ample, reading and sending mail, ac­
cessing bboards, and support for no­
madic use. It also provides certain new 
features that are important to our us­
ers, such as easy handling of multiple 
message enclosures.”
A key standard was that any 
recommended mail client be able to 
support “nomadic use.” Nomadic use, 
according to Futhey, refers to the num­
ber of users on campus that frequently 
access email from multiple computers. 
This differs from the corporate environ­
ment where one would usually access 
email from one computer.
Cyrus uses IMAP4 (Internet Message 
Access Protocol), a mail protocol that

Building a stairway to heaven...
Civil and environmental engineering seniors construct a staircase behind Doherty Hall as part of an annual project.
I seek the Presidency of the Student 
Body, along with John Meier, vice 
presidential candidate, on the basis of 
several principles.
First of all, we will work to make 
classes work better for students, ad­
dressing such important issues as the 
academic calendar, registration, and 
teacher quality. Secondly, we will im­
prove campus life, through projects like 
the Morewood basement, gym facility 
improvements, and University Center 
hours. Also, we will make Student Gov­
ernment more responsive to students 
and their needs, by improving commu­
nication with students, spending more 
time doing, and making Student Gov­
ernment smaller and more efficient.
In addition to these goals, we are fair 
and open to all opinions, have leader­
ship experience (I am in my third term 
as a Senator for MCS and am currently 
a Senate committee chair; John is fin­
ishing up his first term on Senate for 
CIT and is currently the president of 
Alpha Phi Omega), and possess the 
will and the want to work for the stu­
dents and make their lives better.
Sarah and Will offer a combined team 
with over three years experience in Stu­
dent Government. Workingclosely with 
both student organizations and the ad­
ministration, they will make students’ 
interests heard on campus, as well as 
provide information to the students.
Sarah is a sophomore in H&SS and 
has been on Student Senate for two- 
and-a-half semesters. She has served 
as Public Relations chair and is cur­
rently serving as the chair for the 
Campus Affairs Committee. She is 
involved in Scotch ’n’ Soda, Lambda 
Sigma, Vice President’s Student Ad­
visory Council, and Hillel.
Will is a junior physics major and 
former student senate chair. As vice 
president of the student body, he will 
elevate the visibility of the position, 
working closely to promote interac­
tion between groups of students, as 
well as students and the administra­
tion. He is a brother of Kappa Sigma 
fraternity, a midshipman in Carnegie 
Mellon Navy ROTC, and a youth 
volunteer worker at the Church 
of the Ascension.

Forum explains 
variety of views
By DEAN S. HO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Get a roomful of Republicans, Libertarians, and Socialists 
together and usually you have a recipe for pandemonium.
But last Thursday at the political forum “Why is There No 
Democracy in America?” — hosted by CMUnity — members 
of the campus community joined to discuss politics in the first 
of a planned series of open panel-style debates.
To account for the wide variety of differing opinions,
CMUnity selected a very general topic to discuss. However, 
according to Rich Parker, sophomore industrial manage­
ment major and one of the CMUnity members who orga­
nized the event, the focus of CMUnity is generally more 
specific. “We really want to be a local, grass-roots, account­
able organization. So, CMU and Pittsburgh politics is what 
we are really looking at,” he said.
More than 100 students attended the forum in DH 2210 
and listened to panelists from organizations at Carnegie 
Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and the surrounding 
Pittsburgh community. Representatives from the CMU 
Libertarians, Campus Coalition for Peace and Justice,
Student Pugwash, Socialist Workers Party, Campus Re­
publicans, and Amnesty International each gave a brief Erica Yamada/Tartan Photo Staff

Northern Ireland willsupport peace deal
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP)
— The executive committee of North­
ern Ireland’s biggest political party 
voted today to back the historic peace 
deal aimed at ending 30 years of vio­
lence — a victory for Ulster Unionist 
leader David Trimble.
Facing rebels in his ranks, Trimble 
appealed to his pro-British Protestant 
followers during an acrimonious five- 
hour meeting to accept the compromise 
peace accord reached Friday. He said 
he was delighted by their support.
Opponents argued that the agree­
ment was a sell-out to the Irish Repub­
lican Army.
But the party’s 110-member execu­
tive committee voted to back the peace 
deal. It will now be considered by the 
party’s full council at a meeting in 
Belfast next Saturday, but Trimble 
said he does not expect a reversal.
“When people sit down and analyze 
this document, I believe the result will 
be even stronger in our favor,” he said.
Trimble said he understood the deep 
reservations, which he also shared. 
But he said, “The people calling me a 
traitor are only a small group, who 
have, over the last number of years, 
called everybody in this party names.”
William Thompson, an Ulster Union­
ist lawmaker who vowed to vote “no” 
when the accord is subjected to a refer­
endum May 22 in Northern Ireland, 
said the campaign to scrap the agree­
ment would not end with today’s vote.
“We will continue to fight it all the 
way. Mr. Trimble may claim this to be 
a victory but it’s anything but,” he said.
Trimble — whose party opposes Irish 
unity and is central to making the 
agreement work — went to the Ulster 
Unionists’ downtown Belfastheadquar- 
ters early today to sell the settlement.
While Northern Ireland would re­
main part of the United Kingdom with 
a new assembly, the Protestants and 
Catholics in this new administration 
would be required to forge formal links 
with the rest of Ireland, too.
The Belfast talks chairman, former 
U.S. Senator George Mitchell, won 
acceptance Friday from all eight par­
ticipating parties after 22 months 
of negotiations.
But half of the Ulster Unionists’ 10 
members in the British Parliament have 
criticized or condemned outright key 
aspects of the compromise: early re­
leases for Irish Republican Army pris­
oners, a role for the IRA-allied Sinn Fein 
party in the new assembly, and require­
ments that this new administration co­
operate in a North-South ministerial 
council with the Irish Republic.
“Trimble has conceded on almost 
every point he said he would stand 
on,” said Thompson.
“The IRA and Sinn Fein have bombed 
themselves to the negotiating table, and 
now they can have one of their people 
sitting on the assembly’s executive. Who 
would have imagined that could have 
happened a year ago?” he said.
A veteran Unionist lawmaker, Wil­
liam Ross, said the accord was not “a 
peace deal” but rather “a full-blown 
surrender to IRA demands.”
Northern Ireland’s only previous at­
tempt to forge compromise was de­
stroyed in 1974 by an Ulster Unionist 
split and a widespread Protestant strike.
Rival protests outside the Ulster 
Unionists’ headquarters illustrated 
how this split in Protestant opinion 
still exists.
Before the meeting began, a half- 
dozen Protestants from a pro-British 
fraternal group marched up to the front 
door and handed in a letter of protest.
“All those people didn’t die since 
1974just so we could hand everything 
over now,” said the leader of the march­
ers, evangelist Alan Campbell. He said 
the accord would “release IRA mur­
derers onto the streets and let the IRA 
hold on to its arms.”
But as the meeting began, about 50 
Protestants from the nearby working- 
class Shankill district arrived to wave 
banners praising Trimble’s support 
for the accord.
Many were relatives of imprisoned 
members of Northern Ireland’s two 
major pro-British paramilitary groups, 
who would win early paroles if the 
agreement works.
For-profit schools 
stir controversy
NORRISTOWN, Penn. (AP) - Jordan 
Feltes is 3. He likes playing with plastic 
helicopters, singing “Wheels on the Bus,” 
and listing his favorite animals in flaw­
less Spanish.
In a neighboring room, Shannon 
Smith’s kindergarten class is sorting 
colors and shapes on a computer spread­
sheet and learning phonics.
Jordan and Shannon are two of the 
brightest students at the 110-pupil 
Chesterbrook Academy in suburban Phila­
delphia. Their progress is monitored by 
their parents, teachers, and thousands of 
stockholders who have invested in Nobel 
Education Dynamics Inc., the largest for- 
profit school operator in the country.
Nobel’s advanced curriculum and long 
hours — schools are open from 6 a.m. to 
6 p.m. — make it popular with middle- 
income working parents. Tuition ranges 
from $4,500 to $6,000 ayear; and classes 
always have fewer than 20 students.
“I never even thought about it (being 
for-profit) or even knew about it,” said 
Karen Smith, whose daughter, Shan­
non, has attended Chesterbrook since 
she was 9 weeks old. “She’s just getting 
an excellent education. She wouldn’t be 
getting this at another preschool or at 
public school.”
Despite Smith’s enthusiasm, educators 
say bringing capitalism to the classroom 
could ruin learning as we know it.
“With a not-for-profit, the decisions 
are going to be made based on what is 
best for the institution and what is best 
for the students,... (not based) on which 
way the financial winds are blowing,” 
said Margaret Goldsborough, spokes­
woman for the National Association of 
Independent Schools, which only repre­
sents nonprofit schools.
But advocates of for-profit schools say 
education should run like a business. If 
customers — i.e. parents — are dissatis­
fied or finances run amok, the business 
should fold, they say.
“Every aspect of education ... every­
thing the schools need to operate is done 
on a free-market basis except for the 
actual teaching of children and manage­
ment of schools,” said John McLaughlin, 
director ofthe Education Industry Group, 
which tracks 25 publicly traded educa­
tion companies, only a handful of which 
run schools. “That’s an accepted way of 
doing business in every other facet of our
life, and I don’t see why it cannot play 
out in education.”
Nobel’s success or failure could be 
the beginning of a major change in the 
U.S. education.
“It’s part of this overall feeling that 
public institutions are not operating well 
enough, so you bring in market prin­
ciples to have it operate better,” said Jack 
Jennings, director of the Center on Na­
tional Education Policy in Washington. 
“If they are successful, public schools 
should emulate the for-profit schools. If 
they are not successful, they should 
blow away.”
Scientists study 
fly aerodynamics
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - Anyone 
who ever spent a summer day swatting 
at — and missing — pesky flies knows 
frustration. Now scientists say it’s aero­
dynamics that makes flies the sawiest 
fliers on the planet.
The insects are equipped with an in­
teractive control system so simple yet 
intricate that they could teach aeronau­
tical engineers a thing or two, said 
Michael Dickinson of the University of 
California, Berkeley.
He believes the lowly fly’s design could 
help engineers in a number of ways, 
such as designing miniature flying ro­
bots to help in space missions.
“Flies are the most accomplished fli­
ers on the planet in terms of aerodynam­
ics,” he said in a study published in the 
journal Science.
“They can do things no other animal 
can, like land on ceilings or inclined 
surfaces,” said Dickinson, an assistant 
professor of integrative biology. “They 
are especially deft at takeoffs and land­
ings — their skill far exceeds that of any 
other insect or bird.”
The secret is in a pair of lollipop­
shaped wing stubs called halteres, which 
act as the fly’s gyroscope and relay subtle 
visual signals to their wing muscles to 
keep them on course.
To understand the fly’s workings, 
Dickinson and his Berkeley colleagues 
built a virtual reality video game for flies.
First, fruit and blow flies were glued to 
sticks and partly dissected so electrodes 
could be attached to individual muscles. 
Then, while lights flashed to simulate 
motion in various directions, the flies were 
allowed to move their wings as if flying.
Scientists have long known about the 
existence of halteres and that they func­
tion as motion-sensors in a manner simi­
lar to humans’ inner ears. But Dickinson 
and colleagues found that the tiny wing 
stubs are wired to the flies’ eyes.
He said the virtual reality system 
showed an obvious and immediate 
connection between the muscles and 
the eyes.
“Lo and behold, the first time we did it
— boom — it is attached,” said Dickinson. 
“Totally unexpected.”
Wildfires shroud 
Brunei in smoke
BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei 
(AP) — Rising like a mirage from a 
smoky backdrop, the Sultan of Brunei’s 
1,788-room palace — the world’s largest 
residence — was almost invisible Satur­
day behind a thick curtain of smog.
Nearby wildfires, fueled by the worst 
drought in 30 years, have shrouded the
oil-rich kingdom on the northern coast 
of Borneo island with a mix of smoke 
and' pollution.
The choking, clouds in Brunei, one of 
the world’s smallest and wealthiest coun­
tries, have in recent weeks shut the 
international airport periodically, 
pushed pollution up to critical levels, 
and filled hospitals with patients com­
plaining of asthma-like symptoms.
The airport was closed again for one 
hour on Saturday, and short-distance 
flights to Miri and Mulu in nearby Ma­
laysia were canceled for the third con­
secutive day.
An eye-stinging smoke that smells of 
burnt wood permeates cars and buildings 
throughout the capital, Bandar Seri 
Begawan. Residents in the city of 60,000 
wear surgical masks indoors and outside.
Outside the city, the regal dimensions 
of the Sultan’s 50-acre palace can only 
be imagined.
“There you usually see the big gold 
dome and the pointed palace roofs,” said 
Sapar Hamid, a taxi driver, waving an 
arm across a a slate-colored sky.
In the city center, hundreds of people 
clogged the RIPAS Hospital, the only 
public hospital. Many breathed through 
portable respirators in the cloudy hall­
way and clutched their throats when 
asked what ailed them.
Rosina Bte Until held her 8-month-old 
daughter, who wore a face mask.
“The doctor said she should wear a 
mask whenever we go outside,” the 
mother said, adding that the child had 
developed a dry, chronic cough.
Survivors hold funerals for Southeastern tornado victims
EDGEWATER, Ala. (AP) - 
The first funerals were held Sat­
urday for victims of this week’s 
deadly tornadoes that killed 33 
people in Alabama, five in Geor­
gia, and one each in Mississippi 
and North Carolina.
Among the Alabama victims 
buried were a 34-year-old woman 
and her two sons, ages 7 and 4. 
Also buried were a couple whose 
mobile home was picked up 40 
feet in the air then dropped up­
side down on a road. The couple’s 
10-year-old son helped rescue his 
two younger sisters.
Vice President A1 Gore, accom­
panied by a contingent of con­
gressmen, senators, and federal 
and state officials, toured the dev­
astated area by air Friday. He 
promised swift, efficient assis­
tance to storm victims.
“The devastation we saw on 
this tour exceeds that associated 
with any tornado I have ever 
seen,” said Gore, who has visited 
such sites for President Clinton 
for six years.
Brian Peters of the National 
Weather Service said the 
damage was caused by three 
monster tornadoes, packing 
winds as high as 300 mph — 
strong enough to lift houses off 
their foundations.
Witnesses described the twister 
as a huge, boiling cloud that left a 
path of destruction almost 31 
miles long and as much as a half- 
mile wide in places.
Emergency management offi­
cials said Friday up to 1,117 
homes had been destroyed in 
Jefferson County alone. Else­
where in the state, officials said 
the total number of damaged 
homes was still guesswork.
The vice president also used an 
Army helicopter to tour mile af­
ter mile of the storm-damaged 
neighborhoods north of Atlanta. 
The tornadoes were blamed for 
five deaths in Georgia.
With Tipper Gore snapping 
photos, they saw swimming pools 
filled with debris, tennis courts 
littered with broken light poles, 
large fields of downed or snapped 
trees, and numerous homes with 
roofs torn or smashed.
There were also signs of the be­
ginning of recovery. Many houses 
were patched with sheets of blue 
plastic, and trees were being sawed 
up into piles of firewood.
Referringto a series of disasters 
in Georgia this year — floods, a 
crop freeze, and the March 20 tor­
nado that killed 12 in northeast 
Georgia — Gore said, “This string 
of disasters has tested this state.”
The state suffered an estimated 
$30 million in damages, insur­
ance officials said Friday. Gore 
said 97 of Georgia’s 159 counties 
are eligible for disaster assistance.
“You are in our prayers. We 
will stand by you. We care about 
you, and we will reach out to 
you,” he said.
The violent storms that swept 
through Alabama add once again 
to the toll that has made April the 
deadliest month for tornadoes.
While more twisters occur in 
May and June, statistics collected 
by the federal government over 
more than 40 years show more 
deaths in April by a wide margin.
And Alabama ranks fourth in 
deaths over the same period.
Indeed, it was just four years 
ago, March. 27,1994, that torna­
does tore through northern Ala­
bama and parts of Georgia, kill­
ing 42 people and injuring 320 in. 
a spring outbreak.
Spring, with its warming but 
changeable weather, tends to 
spawn the storms — cold fronts 
from the north and west can clash 
with warmer, wet air moving in 
from the Gulf of Mexico, provid­
ing the swirling ingredients for 
the violent storms, observed Na­
tional Weather Service meteo­
rologist Scott Kiser.

50 YEARS AGO, April 13, 
1948 — CIT’s student council 
announced a party to close out 
the year’s activities. Socialites 
were planning to party the night 
away, moving from the outdoor 
swimming pool to an indoor ball­
room, where films of “the best 
bands of the land” were to be 
shown on screen. The combina­
tion of “subdued lights” and the 
“most pleasing music available” 
promised to make the dance 
the highlight of the spring, aside 
from Carnival.
25 YEARS AGO, April 17,1973 
— President Richard Cyert 
named metallurgy and materials 
science Professor Harold W. 
Paxton to the newly created di­
rector of research position. As 
director of research, Paxton’s 
principal duties were to assist 
faculty in obtaining research
grants and to work closely with 
the Division of Sponsored Re­
search. Paxton, who joined Cam­
egie Mellon in 1953, is currently 
the U.S. Steel professor emeritus 
with the materials science de­
partment.
TEN YEARS AGO, April 12, 
1988 — A water break in 
Hamerschlag House caused 
power failures in Hamerschlag, 
Boss, Margaret Morrison, Scaife, 
GSIA, the Hunt Library, and 
Skibo, the old student union. The 
water flooded into an under­
ground transformer, short-cir- 
cuiting power wires and burst­
ing a steam pipe in Scobell Hall. 
Some students had to be moved 
to local hotels. Structural dam­
age to the buildings was mini­
mal, but certain components 
of the transformer had to 
be replaced.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 12, 
1993 — Student Senate made a 
formal recommendation to ask 
the Board of Trustees to raise the 
Activities Fee by $5 each semes­
ter, bringing it to a total of 
$110. Under the student body 
bylaws, the Board of Trustees 
has the sole power to raise the 
Activities Fee.
Last semester, a student refer­
endum approved an increase in 
the activities fee, from $50 each 
semester to $65 each semester. 
The measure then was passed on 
to Student Senate and the Gradu­
ate Students Association; the fi­
nal decision rests with the Board 
of Trustees.
ONE YEAR AGO, April 14, 
1997 — Byron Krug, junior elec­
trical and computer engineering 
and engineering and public 
policy major, was re-elected to a
second term as student body 
president. Matthew Phelps, 
sophomore electrical and com­
puter engineer, was elected vice 
president; the incumbent vice 
president, Katie Hart, decided 
not to run with Krug because 
she was planning on studying in 
New York City in the fall of 1997. 
Avinash Jain, sophomore busi­
ness administration major, was 
elected treasurer.
The powers of the president 
include calling special meet­
ings, forming committees, and 
vetoing legislative proposals. 
Krug also planned to use his 
position to increase students’ 
awareness of and participation 
in Senate affairs. Only five per­
cent of the student body voted in 
the election.

Phasing out Andrew...University endorses Cyrus
COMPUTING, from page 1
CMU has been developing since 
1993. It has two main parts: 
the server, which stores and 
accesses the actual email mes­
sages, and the mail applica­
tion, or client, for viewing that 
email on the desktop.
CMU has been working with 
software vendors such as 
Microsoft, who makes Outlook; 
ESYS, producers of Simeon; and 
Cyrusoft, makers of Mulberry. 
With the explosive growth of 
the Internet and email in the 
United States, companies not 
only have a reason to write 
email clients, but also to stay 
on the cutting edge, which is 
where IMAP4 and Cyrus lie.
“There are significant advan­
tages in using commercial mail 
programs, but their use also 
means we need to wait for the 
vendor in some cases,” said 
Futhey. “We’re fortunate that 
several of the IMAP4 mail ven­
dors want to work closely with 
Carnegie Mellon.”
Cyrusoft, in particular, has ac­
commodated CMU’s needs very 
well. They have also been cooper­
ating with other universities, like 
the University of Washington, 
and also corporations interested 
in IMAP4, such as Sun 
Microsystems and Digital Equip­
ment Corporation.
Computing Service’s recom­
mendation of Mulberry in Febru­
ary to the campus community 
came after more than two years 
of evaluating applications that 
support the IMAP4 standard. 
Computing Services has had 
many sources of input for the 
evaluation, including students, 
who have had the opportunity to 
convert to the Cyrus mailing sys­
tem since 1996.
Some students aren’t sure what 
to make of Cyrus. “Most people 
on campus are familiar with 
Ezmail and the Andrew system, 
so switching over abruptly to 
Cyrus wouldn’t be easy,” said 
sophomore electrical and com­
puter engineering major Andy
Chosak. However, he felt that 
if the incoming freshmen were 
taught how to use AMS as well 
as Cyrus, the transition would 
work much better.
“I’ve never used Cyrus be­
fore, so I wouldn’t know [the 
difference between AMS and 
Cyrus]. I’m personally of the ‘If 
it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ phi­
losophy,” said Mike Natale, se­
nior history major.
But other students do recog­
nize some of the advantages 
Cyrus has to offer. “Cyrus does 
do attachments better,” said 
Doug Fearing, junior computer 
science major. “If my brother 
sends me an attachment, I can’t 
read it in Ezmail, but I can 
with a Cyrus account.”
Futhey said that the next 
version of Mulberry, due late 
this spring, will add even more 
functionality, and that version 
2.0, to be released this summer, 
is on target with features that 
Computing Services considers 
to be important for CMU users.
Professor gives Last Lecture
Forum raises awareness

and Justice, speaks at last Wednesday’s CMUnity-sponsored forum;
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan News Editor
When you are a professor, you 
spend your career affecting stu­
dents. But what if you only had one 
last lecture to give — one last hour 
in which you could talk to your 
students and impart some wisdom 
to them? If you were a professor, 
you would want that last lecture to 
be stunning and remarkable.
That is the premise behind 
Carnegie Mellon’s Last Lecture 
series, and that is why Hugh 
Young, professor of physics, titled 
last Wednesday’s lecture “Howto 
Write a Good Obituary.”
After eliciting laughter from the 
the McConomy audience of about 
70 students and staff members 
with a comment that he was not 
planning on discussing his sex 
life, Young explained that the 
way to write a good obituary is to 
be a good tourist (that is, some-
INFORMATION, from page 1
ministration, according to Krug. 
Earlier this semester, Senate con­
ducted a survey of 349 students, 
asking them what types of infor­
mation would be helpful to them 
while registering: Ninety-four per­
cent said they would like to have 
information available online, and 
all of the types of information sug­
gested in the survey — including 
FCE information, class syllabus, 
and test and project dates — were 
supported by greater than 50 per­
cent of those surveyed.
one who constantly seeks out new 
experiences) and a mountain 
climber (someone who tries to 
surmount obstacles) during life.
“[The lecture was] very inspi­
rational,” said freshman MCS 
student John Stultz. “I’m going 
to try to pick out courses that he’s 
teaching next year.”
Young said that he hoped to 
inspire students with the lecture.
“I want people to see me as a 
three-dimensional human being
— for people to see me not just as 
a physicist who gives lectures on 
Monday morning, but as some­
body who has other interests, 
who has emotions as well as 
thoughts, and so forth,” Young 
said after the lecture.
Freshman MCS student Casey 
Helfrich commented that Young 
was very honest in his presenta­
tion. Helfrich said that he often 
passes Young on the trails in 
Schenley Park, jogging.
“Amy Ng and the Academic Af­
fairs committee, Matt [Phelps, stu­
dent body vice president], and I 
worked pretty hard to make sure 
we were representing students ac­
curately,” said Krug. “I think when 
student government goes to such 
lengths ... it tends to get more 
support from administration.” 
Phase II of the plan includes 
gathering more information 
about the courses, including a 
syllabus provided by the instruc­
tors. Since acquiring such infor­
mation would require the coop-
Young spent a substantial por­
tion of the lecture telling anec­
dotes about his mountain climb­
ing experiences amd traveling 
experiences and about mountain­
eers who have scaled Mt. Everest.
“Now, I want you to know that 
I have every confidence that I’m 
going to outlive all of you,” said 
Young as he finished the lecture. 
“But just in case it doesn’t work 
out that way then when it’s time 
for you to write my obituary, I 
hope you’ll write me down as one 
who still has miles to go. Men­
tion my teaching career, and my 
books, and my wife and children 
of course, but also say that I 
loved life.... My parting words 
for all of you is that, when the 
time comes, all of your obituar­
ies may read like this.”
Young originally gave a modi­
fied version of the speech about 
eight years ago as part of the Last 
Lecture series.
eration of individual instructors, 
Senate does not expect Phase II 
to be implemented this semester.
“Phase II could not happen this 
year. It would be a logistical night­
mare,” said Krug. As for the like­
lihood of Phase II happening at 
any point in the future, Krug said, 
“This can’t happen unless faculty 
buy into it as well. My guess is 
the good instructors, the instruc­
tors who care about teaching, will 
take the time to fill [the request 
for information] out, provided it’s 
not too difficult.”
POLITICS, from page 1
speech about the overall topic and 
’then answered questions from the 
audience in an open-mike ques- 
tion-and-answer session.
Sarah Dunn, sophomore mod­
em languages maj or and CMUnity 
member, said that the motivation 
to hold a political forum was 
sparked by a general lack of com­
munication that was perceived 
among the general student body. 
“We wanted to call upon students 
to exercise their right to voice their 
opinions and to eschew the idea 
that CMU students are apathetic 
about their political and social situ­
ation,” she said.
Parker was enthusiastic about 
the support shown by the campus 
community. “We pretty much 
demonstrated that there are 
people who want to be active, 
which I think is what [Thursday’s] 
meeting was about,” he said. He 
also added that without the coop­
eration and dedication of so many 
students, the forum would not 
have been able to take place.
“I think we really disproved 
that idea that CMU students are 
apathetic,” he said.
Representing a wide span along 
the ideological spectrum, the pan­
elists offered an array of opinions 
on issues such as police brutality, 
affirmative action, abortion, and 
the amount of government regu­
lation deemed proper. For ex­
ample, the CMU Libertarians ar­
gued that while the major, press­
ing issues of America are handled 
in a democratic way, the more 
common, minor issues are not sub­
ject to public review and happen 
by the whim of politicians.
“It seemed that many of us be­
lieved that the decisions which 
shouldbemade arenotmade demo­
cratically,” said Adam Retchless, 
sophomore biology major and 
CMU Libertarian panelist.
The Socialist Workers Party 
talked about building a massive 
revolutionary movement to take 
political power out of the hands of 
American capitalists. The Cam­
pus Republicans, on the other 
hand, upheld American democ­
racy and reasoned that our gov­
ernment has the ability to adapt 
and expand.
Despite many differing opin­
ions, panelists were able to agree 
on the importance of taking ac­
tion and expressing opinions.
“When I first saw the list of 
organizations that would be speak­
ing, I wasn’t sure whether there 
would be a very good cross-section 
of political opinions, but I was 
pleasantly surprised,” said Chris 
White, freshman electrical and 
computer engineering major and 
representative for the CMU Cam­
pus Republicans. “Throughout the 
evening there were liberal ideas 
and there were conservative ideas, 
and they were all presented.”
Some students* however, criti­
cized the forum, despite its gen­
erally positive reception. 
“As someone so succinctly 
pointed out, there was only one 
woman [on the panel], and there 
should have been a few more,” 
said Consuelo Concepcion, 
a master’s student in English. 
“There should have been a little 
more accurate representation.” 
However, Concepcion liked the 
overall outcome of the forum 
and said that the discussion 
was a starting point for 
further events.
CMU’s WRCT broadcast the 
forum live. Although WRCT usu­
ally broadcasts campus events 
such as football and basketball 
games, Buggy races, and Spring
Carnival events, it has recently 
expanded its coverage to include 
speakers participating in Black 
History Month events and the 
grand opening of Entropy East.;
“Broadcasting remote events is 
something that hasn’t happened 
too consistently in the past, at 
least from my knowledge,” said 
Joseph Kenney, junior math ma­
jor and WRCT production direc­
tor. “Recently, though, we have 
been covering more events.”
Though there will not be enough 
time to organize another forum 
before the end of the year, Parker 
says CMUnity will still hold meet­
ings this year to start planning 
for next year.

Grime and Incident Report
3/31 DISORDERLY CON­
DUCT, 11:43 pm — A Central 
Property Services employee was 
doing his work outside on the . 
CFA mall area when he was hit 
in the back of the neck with a 
water balloon, soaking his cloth­
ing. Upon being struck with the 
balloon, the victim heard laugh­
ter from a second-floor window. 
He went to the mezzanine level of 
CFA and asked if anyone knew 
who hit him with the balloon, but 
no one would say.
However, three students in the 
room left when he entered, so he 
followed them. After some inter­
rogation, the three admitted that 
they were the ones who threw the 
water balloons, but they said that 
they did not intend to hit anyone, 
let alone him. The victim had 
called Campus Police, and the 
officer issued the trio internal 
citations for disorderly conduct.
At this time, the employee 
requested to go to the hospital 
due to a sore and stiff neck. A 
city medic was called, and the 
victim was transported to 
Shadyside Hospital.
4/6 MEDICAL, 6:07 am - The 
same CPS employee contacted 
Campus Police saying that the
muscles in his neck and shoul­
ders were beginning to spasm. 
The responding officers radioed 
for a city medic, which trans­
ported the man to Allegheny Gen­
eral Hospital.
4/1 INCIDENT, 12:26 pm - 
An officer responded to the Cut in 
front of Doherty Hall. When he 
arrived, he found several hun­
dred dead fish lying on the Cut 
and inside the double door en­
trance to Doherty Hall. CPS was 
notified for cleanup. Several stu­
dents were questioned about the 
incident, but no one would say 
when or how the fish got there.
4/5 MARIJUANA, 1:26 am - 
A dispatcher received an anony-. 
mous call about a strong mari­
juana stench on the third floor of 
Morewood Gardens E-Tower. The 
responding officers noticed the 
smell emanating from a room and 
knocked on the door. Someone 
replied, “Who is it?” to which one 
officer replied, “Campus Police.”
The officers could hear move­
ment inside the room, but no one 
would open the door. The officer 
at the door used his building key 
to enter the room, and the other 
three followed. The officers ex­
plained the reason for their pres­
ence and then asked for the mari­
juana. No one responded, so the 
officers conducted a search. The 
officers eventually found a plas­
tic bag with marijuana in it, a 
copper pipe, a small glass pipe, 
and two glass bowls in a desk 
drawer. The bowls belonged to a 
bong found under the same desk. 
The items were confiscated, and 
all students present in the room 
were issued disorderly conduct 
internal citations.
4/9 HARASSMENT, 10:00 pm
— While conducting a fire alarm 
test in Morewood Gardens E- 
Tower, an officer heard voices 
coming from a stairwell. The of­
ficer saw a group of six people in 
the stairwell while the alarm 
was ringing.
At this point, one of the males 
rushed out of the stairwell, say­
ing that he was being threatened 
by the other individuals. The vic­
tim was the one who called Cam­
pus Police about the strong mari­
juana odor, as detailed in the 
previous incident report. The 
other five in the stairwell were 
the ones caught by Campus Po­
lice. The victim said they were 
demanding $350 of him to com­
pensate for their losses that, ac­
cording to them, he had caused. 
The officer issued the five in 
the stairwell citations for failure 
to evacuate the building during 
a fire drill. The victim was 
not issued a citation because 
he was not able to leave on 
his own accord.
4/5 DISORDERLY CON­
DUCT, 1:36 am — An officer was 
dispatched to a fraternity in re­
sponse to a complaint. Appar­
ently, a neighboring fraternity 
had been throwing eggs at their 
porch. The officer talked to the 
president of the accused frater­
nity about the incident and ex­
plained that no citations would 
be issued if the mess was cleaned 
up. The president said his frater­
nity would comply.
4/7 THEFT, 12:13 pm - A 
man wearing a dark blue cordu­
roy suit was seen in the Univer­
sity Shoppe acting in a very sus­
picious manner. One of the em­
ployees noticed the actor near 
the back of the store by a stack of 
books titled Graziano Research 
Methods. She asked if she could 
help him. He stopped what he 
was doing and left the store after
this. The employee watched as he 
exited the UC and got into a navy 
blue Ford Taurus.
At approximately noon, a Pitt 
Book Store employee called the 
University Shoppe to inform 
them that a man of similar de­
scription tried to return a book 
titled Graziano Research Meth­
ods. The store would not let him 
return the book because he had 
no Pitt ID and would not present 
any ID at all. However, the man 
was not detained.
None of the University Shoppe 
employees actually saw the man 
take the book, but they noted 
that the man appeared to have 
something stuck under his suit 
coat when he left the store.
4/9 HARASSMENT, 8:15 pm
— Campus Police was contacted 
to assist in calming a disruptive 
male during a sexual assault in­
formation meeting. Two officers 
responded to the seventh floor of 
Morewood E-Tower, where the 
meeting was being held.
The actor had been disputing 
statements made by one of the 
speakers. Then, he became more 
agitated and started to swear 
and speak loudly about his be­
liefs. His actions upset some of
the participants, and according 
to the complaint, the meeting 
quickly assumed an air of un­
easiness and discomfort.
The officers called the actor out 
of the room and told him that, 
although he was allowed to at­
tend the meeting, he had to con­
duct himself in an appropriate 
and polite manner. They also ex­
plained that if they received an­
other call, he would be cited for 
disorderly conduct. The actor ex­
claimed, “This is bullshit,” and 
subsequently left the area.

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University 13 April 1998
Debate encourages 
political activism
.STiJDENT— RUNPOI ITIPAL PQRUM i
James Mojonnler/Tartan Art Co-Editor
Letters to the Editor
Last Thursday, the student body 
of CMU proved that it was not as 
politically apathetic as some have 
claimed. The forum “Why is There 
no Democracy in America?” brought 
together representatives from a 
number of student groups to dis­
cuss their opinions in a structured 
setting. Planned and implemented 
by students, the event proved to be 
an effective venue for substantial 
political discussion. Organizers and 
participants shouldbe commended 
for providing the campus commu­
nity with such a needed outlet 
for expression.
The forum began with each rep­
resentative from participating 
organizations addressing the 
overall question of the state of 
democracy in America. Following 
the responses, audience members 
had the opportunity to ask ques­
tions. The discussion gave attend­
ees a variety of viewpoints as well 
as an idea of how others in the 
CMU community feel about the 
importance of activism. In a way, 
the forum addressed its own ques­
tion by creating a place which fit 
the definition of a democracy: 
Each member of a society is given 
the opportunity to speak his or 
her mind.
Over 100 students and faculty 
were present at the forum, and 
many others were able to listen to 
the event on WKCT. The live 
broadcast made the event acces­
sible and further promoted politi­
cal awareness and activism within
Newspapers in general are rela­
tively predictable — there’s the 
news sections, the sports sections, 
and the comics, usually along with 
the living and entertainment sec­
tions. Often there is very little 
opportunity to respond to what 
we see in print. At The Tartan, we 
find a lot of value in the exchange 
and in the frequent clash of ideas. 
The Forum pages are our way of 
fostering a free exchange of ideas, 
so we try to provide a spectrum of 
opinions to allow you, our read­
ers, to be the judges.
To that end, you’ll find the fol­
lowing types of pieces in Forum:
Editorials always appear in the 
left-most columns of the first Fo­
rum page. They are unsigned 
because they represent a consen­
sus opinion of The Tartan’s 
editorial board.
While we believe our editorials 
offer sensible, accurate commen­
tary, please feel free to disagree 
with us — we don’t have a mo­
nopoly on the truth. As a matter 
of fact, we would love to know 
what you think. An excellent 
means to do this is by writing a 
Letter to the Editor.
Letters to the Editor may be sub­
mitted by anybody, although when 
space gets tight, we will favor let­
ters from members of the Univer­
sity community. As readers, you 
should realize that opinions rep­
resented in a letter are those of the 
author and not of The Tartan. All 
letters are subject to editing for 
size and grammar (letters should 
not exceed 350 words). But we
the student body. The forum also 
gave students the opportunity to 
become aware of some of the dif­
ferent activist groups on campus 
and their beliefs without making 
a commitment to join. By offering 
the organizations the chance to 
voice their thoughts on common 
topics, the discussion also helped 
alleviate some of the stereotypes 
associated with different 
political groups.
Also, the event was vital be­
cause it got students to think 
about politics at an important 
time of the year — Student Sen­
ate elections are a week away. 
Low turnout at the polls has been 
common in the past. Hopefully, 
this political forum has forced stu­
dents to think critically about 
their governing bodies and moti­
vated them to cast their ballots.
With the support of the organiz­
ers and participating groups, the 
political forum has the potential 
to become a regular event. This 
would further fan the flames of 
political activism at CMU, en­
couraging participation both in 
internal affairs such as student 
government elections as well as 
local, national, and global issues. 
By continuing to create opportu­
nities to voice their thoughts and 
opinions in an open forum, CMU 
students can increase their 
understanding of the world 
around them and think about is­
sues outside the bubble of their 
own schoolwork.
never edit a letter for content.
Of course, we reserve the right 
to reject letters that we feel are 
libelous, obscene, or incoherent. 
But we’ll be glad to discuss any 
letter with the author and see if 
we can reach a compromise. How­
ever, in order to have such a dis­
cussion, we need to know who you 
are. We are willing to withhold 
the author’s name from a Letter 
to the Editor, but our Editor-in- 
Chief does need to know who wrote 
it. Please don’t send us anony­
mous letters — it just frustrates 
us because we have no way to 
contact you, and it annoys you 
because your letter doesn’t get 
published.
Person’s Opinion is just that — 
the opinion of randomly polled 
persons, usually students at 
CMU, on a different question or 
concern each week. The people in 
Person’s Opinion have no affilia­
tion with The Tartan, and their 
opinions are in no way related to 
The Tartan.
Columns are consistently-ap­
pearing opinion pieces presented 
by individuals who are members 
of the CMU community. We are 
looking to diversify the Forum 
section and encourage students, 
faculty and staff to write a col­
umn on something which inter­
ests them. Opinions in these col­
umns are those of the columnist 
and not of The Tartan.
Again, feel free to disagree with 
them. Getting feedback lets us 
know that you are reading and 
thinking about The Tartan.
Column provokes 
varied responses
Editor:
Having been at the 
DTD party, and as one 
I +n the few Greeks on
.u Ca1* campus who is openlytil© editor bisexual, I can say that 
I do not feel that Dave Liber’s being asked 
to leave [“Gays deserve social accep­
tance” 4/6] was based on homophobia. I 
do believe that DTD had more than 
enough of a legitimate basis in asking 
Dave to leave. As he is underage, that 
could be suspicion that he had anything 
to drink. As many frequenters will tell 
you, it is harder to get, served at DTD 
than many local bars. One common loop­
hole is asking a legal friend to get you a 
beer. This is acted upon as would respon­
sibly be expected by the brothers of DTD.
Being that they are in their own home, 
I do not feel that DTD needs to offer an 
explanation as to why they are asking 
someone to leave their home. I find it 
disturbing that Dave Liber felt it was 
because he is “bisexual” that they asked 
him to leave. I believe that if he really 
felt this way his responsible course of 
action should have been to go to them 
the next day and try to talk to them.
Personally I feel that the party was in 
DTD’s house and that if they feel uncom­
fortable with public displays of affection 
that they have a right to ask the person to 
stop or leave if they won’t stop. If a 
heterosexual couple was doing stuff that 
made them uncomfortable, I would ex­
pect them to reserve the same rights. I 
can say that I do believe that DTD is very 
friendly and is not homophobic in any
experiences I have ever had with them.
Brothers present at the party have 
remarked to me, “I don’t care if you 
dance with a guy or a girl.” During Rent- 
A-Delt I made arrangements to rent one 
of the brothers of DTD for a date. I have 
friends in the house that I feel comfort­
able discussing gay-related issues with. 
To make any allegation against DTD or 
any of its brothers seems suspect to me.

Editor:
Dave Liber’s column 
hit me in a personal
I tn place because I both?h PH't sympathize with andtil© fcaitor criticize where he 
stands. Liber states that he is bisexual 
but is a “conservative Republican, not in 
favor of gay rights by any means.” But if 
this is the case, why is he writing this 
column? What Liber experienced at the 
DTD party isn’t out of the ordinary. In 
fact, it’s part of the reason why many gay 
people fight for the same rights that 
Liber feels they don’t deserve.
This is the first incident of discrimina­
tion that Liber experiences. It was some­
thing simple: he and his boyfriend were 
not accepted at a party. And he brings 
this injustice to light as if it were the 
most criminal of offenses brought upon a 
human being. Liber has never been 
evicted by a bigoted landlord; he’s never 
been beaten or raped by group of ho­
mophobic men; he’s never been turned 
away from a job, lost custody of a child 
nor been denied marriage over his sexual 
identity. He’s found it easy to live life
until now and found no reason why gays ; 
should care for rights.
So I ask Liber and others like him to j 
consider their stand on the gay rights ; 
movement, to consider what it’s done for ; 
them already and what it’s capable of | 
doing. Because without it, Liber should ; 
prepare to experience things much worse ; 
than being thrown out of a party.

Editor:
David Liber is to be ! 
commended for his | 
forthrightness in ad­
dressing an issue that 
is generally avoided in I 
society today — that of discrimination I 
against homosexuals and bisexuals. By 
writing about his experience at DTD, 
Liber’s intent was not to criticize DTD as 
a fraternity. Rather, it was to criticize 
discriminatory attitudes that are present 
on CMU’s campus, which became evident 
to him for the first time in the situation 
that arose at DTD last weekend.
I would suggest that anyone who took 
offense to Liber’s column because it ex­
posed an incident as having happened at 
a particular fraternity rethink their 
stand on this issue. Liber did not attack 
DTD as an institution — he attacked an 
idea. Moreover, he addressed an issue of 
serious concern that we all need to think 
about — treating people for who they 
are, not for whom they are attracted to.

Pronoun debate shortchanges feminism
Lorelei Laird
Call me Camille Paglia, but 
I think some feminists are 
taking it too far.
Specifically, I refer to the 
modifications to language 
that have been popping up all 
over the printed media for the 
last few years, the new trend 
of replacing “he” with “he or 
she” or, in some rather hor­
rendous cases, “they.” It’s be­
come commonly accepted both 
in the media and in conversa­
tion. The rationale behind the 
adoption of “he or she” by most 
printed publications is that 
“he” alone is sexist and disre­
gards the entire female half 
of the human species. Some 
feminists have cheered this 
as a step forward for the 
women’s movement. I contend 
that it’s actually a step back.
As you might imagine, I’m 
no fan of sexism myself. But 
feminism is about equal rights 
for women, not about gram­
mar. Putting this restriction 
on people’s words creates 
more resentment than it does 
progress. Instead of a positive
force for change, feminism is 
seen as a nuisance, and femi­
nists are seen as nitpickers or 
dopey. Quite simply, these 
pronoun changes trivialize 
feminism, making it into an 
issue of trifling details rather 
than significant, socially rel­
evant issues. Plus, it scares 
off potential supporters by 
making the whole movement 
seem ridiculous. That’s hardly 
the way to gain support for 
women’s rights, especially 
given the recent backlash 
against feminism.
Then, too, there’s the issue 
of what this does to the En­
glish language. You’ve prob­
ably already run across a 
newspaper article in which 
“he or she” is used to refer to 
a hypothetical or gender-un­
specified person. This is ac­
cepted style — no publication 
in this day and age wants to 
be called sexist (the lawyer’s 
fees would be astronomical). 
One doesn’t have to be an afi­
cionado of language to see that 
this is awkward and disrup­
tive to the flow of any sen­
tence. Even if it’s technically 
grammatically correct, it’s 
terrible form to complicate 
documents needlessly. It’s
also sort of silly, espe­
cially given that there’s 
already a viable alter­
native in “he.” It 
shouldn’t be necessary 
to malign our poor, un­
related language in the 
quest for equality.
Finally, and most 
simply, it’s just absurd 
to get up in arms over 
something as trivial as 
a pronoun. Not only are 
there better issues for 
feminists to concern them­
selves with, but “he” is tech­
nically quite correct. Those 
who have studied Romance 
languages know that the mas­
culine version of most nouns 
and pronouns can be general­
ized to refer to both genders. 
(In Spanish, for example, 
while padre means “father” 
and madre means “mother,” 
padres can mean either “sev­
eral fathers” or “parents.”)
James Mojonnler/Tartan Art Co-Editor 
derstood that “man” is used 
to refer to general humanity; 
“he” should be no different. 
There’s no reason to be in­
sulted over a well-established 
matter of grammar.
This is not an earth-shat­
tering issue. Nevertheless, it 
affects us, both as students 
with papers, lab reports, and 
proposals to write, and as 
members of a society that is

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 13 April 19985Restricted departments quash exploration
Editor's Notebook
Maybe you have a friend in H&SS who 
couldn’t get into the School of Design’s 
friinor program in communications design. 
Or perhaps you’re an MCS student who 
v/Etsn’t able to nab a spot in Intro to Busi­
ness. You might even know an electrical 
and computer engineering major who 
wants to switch to computer science — but 
alas, there’s no space for her.
Students forking over cash for Carnegie 
Mellon’s $30,000 annual bill frequently 
become frustrated when they can’t add 
academic programs to their transcripts at 
jvill. Theoretically,, the argument goes, if 
we’re able to meet some basic entrance 
Requirement, we should at least be able to 
pursue minors or secondary majors in any 
discipline in which we prove ourselves to 
ie competent.
The fact of the matter is, however, that, 
for various reasons, Carnegie Mellon’s 
academic departments cannot always open 
themselves to any student. CFA, for ex­
ample, has to limit access to its programs 
due to its studio-centered teaching phi-
losophy. Similarly, if the world-renowned 
School of Computer Science were to in­
discriminately open its programs to all 
students, it would not be able to focus its 
resources on its majors.
Therein lies one of the central difficul­
ties of accommodating students’ academic 
goals. Colleges and departments need to 
clarify their obligations to students ma­
joring in the department — students who 
want intellectual depth and a 
highly competitive professional 
training program — versus stu­
dents in other departments who 
are drawn to different subject 
fields out of a curiosity about
design theory, how to program _______
in C++, or Irish literature.
Indeed, the way Carnegie Mellon is 
organized now makes it very easy for 
departments and colleges to forget their 
obligations to non-majors. Between the 
administration’s still-shocking decision 
to eliminate registration priority for mi­
nors and double majors and the separate 
bureaucracies of each of the seven CMU 
colleges, students can quickly and qui­
etly be forced out of classes that they 
might very much like to take in colleges 
other than their home college.
On one hand, it is a unique feature of this 
school that students are able to specialize in 
their fields to the extent that they are. On 
the other hand, when students enter a school 
like Carnegie Mellon, they are exposed to 
many new disciplines that they likely have 
no experience in, such as engineering, de­
sign, statistics, or philosophy. Students may 
not realize how much or how little they 
enjoy these new fields — but students en-
“[It is] very easy for depart­
ments and colleges to forget 
their obligations to non-majors.
tering the University as biology majors prob­
ably won’t have the opportunity to switch to 
drama if they find acting more appealing.
One of the best ways to resolve the prob­
lems created by the tension between the 
commitment to majors and the commit­
ment to broad-based education would be to 
expand the University Choice program. 
Currently, space in the program is offered 
to about 30 or 40 freshmen each year, a tiny 
percentage of each class. These freshmen 
are allowed to remain enrolled in more
than one college for the duration of their 
first year, allowing them to bypass the 
administrative rules that shut out non- 
Choice students from sampling the cur­
ricula of many CMU colleges.
We should be allowed to enter CMU and 
begin to focus on our majors, as with the 
current system. I want my major to be 
challenging: I want to take English courses 
with people who spend lazy Saturday af-
___ ternoons reading Dostoyevsky and
who know that Discipline and Pun­
ish is about panopticons, not S&M. 
But, I want other colleges to welcome 
me as a student who is interested 
and curious, as someone who wants 
to learn what they have to offer.
Although the University cannot do 
everything that students want it to, it 
currently has the ability to make it’s aca­
demic programs more accessible to its stu­
dents. After all, the ultimate purpose of a 
university is to educate, and if a school can 
improve its academic offerings simply and 
inexpensively, it should by all means do so.

someday all hold hands and sing

San Francisco International 
Airport: Northwest Airlines’ 
flight from Detroit arrives five 
hours late. I step off the plane, 
tired, and walk towards the bag­
gage claim. After waiting for 
half an hour, I conclude that my 
bag is not going to come in 
tonight. I look around and 
find a horde of other pas­
sengers who’ve had the 
same misfortune. After I 
stand in line for what seems 
like hours, a Northwest Air­
lines representative finally 
tells me that-my luggage 
won’t get to me until about 
6 pm the next day. She then 
¦refuses to have the airline 
offer any sort of reimburse­
ment for any supplies that 
I have to buy. Why? Be­
cause the airline couldn’t 
care less. To them, the cus­
tomer is always wrong.
’ The general attitude to­
day is to almost ignore the 
customer. Northwest Air­
lines was really not inter­
ested in what a customer had to 
; face as a result of its ineffi­
ciency. The manager at the air- 
Ü port told me that misplaced 
' luggage was a risk one takes 
while traveling, and there was 
nothing they could do about it.
The airline was too proud to 
admit that it made a mistake..
. Still, a simple, heartfelt apol­
ogy would have sufficed. I might 
be taking certain risks while 
travelling, but it is certainly 
my right to demand compensa­
tion for being wronged due to 
the airline’s inadequacies.
Sadly, this situation is be­
coming a trend these days in a 
lot of places, including restau­
rants, shops, and many others.

to affect his business. This total 
apathy for the customer is ter­
rible and unacceptable.
There might be several rea­
sons for this trend of declining 
customer service. For one thing, 
the American economy has been 
doing so well that the various 
service providers might have 
stopped valuing their custom­
ers. They already have so many 
customers that they do not 
bother to take steps to keep them 
satisfied. Unsurprisingly, most 
of the major American airlines 
appear in the 1998 Fortune 500 
list of the top 500 companies 
ranked on the basis of their fi­
nancial performances. These in­
clude, among others, Delta, 
United, Continental, Southwest,
and, of course, Northwest Air­
lines, which is ranked 152. Un­
fortunately, this economic boom 
has brought forth a downfall in 
customer value and service.
After years of paying close at­
tention to making customers 
happy, many companies may 
have grown complacent. An­
other plausible reason is the lack 
of competition in certain indus­
tries. The airline indus­
try, for example, has a 
huge clientele. The com­
petition is not very stiff, 
and allows for the disad­
vantages of a monopoly. 
It is also possible that 
many industries are ill- 
equipped to deal with the 
required customer ser­
vice. The infamous air­
line industry once again 
fits in. Running an air­
line entails tons of com­
plaints — angry passen­
gers, delayed schedules, 
airport delays, technical 
problems, and weather 
difficulties, to name a 
few. The sad fact is that 
airlines just don’t have 
the framework to provide 
the sort of customer service that 
is required of such a problem- 
ridden industry.
Customer service must im­
prove drastically. A smile costs 
nothing and means everything. 
Making customers feel good is 
beneficial for everyone. If com­
panies continue treating custom­
ers like dirt, the customers are 
going to revolt and not associate 
with them anymore. It’s crucial 
for companies to step down from 
the clouds and remember that 
the customer is always right. 
Otherwise, they might not have 
any customers left to piease.

CMU needs coed rooms
Dave Liber
During Orientation this year, 
John Hannon of the Student Life 
Office gave a talk about how 
Carnegie Mellon was not quite 
Melrose Place. After having spent 
almost a year here, I would have 
to disagree. No, we are not con­
ceited, shallow, plastic-surgery- 
fixed, money-hungry starlets who 
sleep with each other and then 
plot to have our exes killed in 
freak accidents. But I would defi­
nitely have to say that we are 
closer to Melrose Place than we 
might like to think. Here at CMU, 
people all pretty much know each 
other, gossip about each other, 
live with each other, and, in some 
cases, sleep with each other.
Because this school is so small 
and close-knit, I would like to 
suggest that housing services al­
low students to room'with other 
students of the opposite sex. We 
are all (in some cases, legal) 
adults, so we should be mature 
enough to handle this type of liv­
ing arrangement. Yes, it would 
be uncomfortable for some people; 
but for others, it would be ideal.
I propose that such a program 
would be run like FYP and be 
restricted only to certain dorms. 
A student would have a choice to 
join the program or not. I under­
stand the problems the adminis­
tration would have dealing with 
parents in this isssue: many 
parents might have a problem 
with their children living in coed 
rooms. While we all maybe adults, 
many of us are still financially 
supported by our parents. How­
ever, each student in the 
program would have to give 
parental notification of their 
living arrangements.
When the end of the year rolls 
around, people must start con­
sidering whom they would like to
room with for the next year. Let’s 
face it, even your best friend could 
become the anti-Christ after you 
live with him or her for a year or 
so. It would make the whole pro­
cess easier if we were allowed to 
room with students of the oppo­
site sex. It’s hard enough finding 
a roommate — why should the 
University restrict us to only liv­
ing with students of the same 
sex? If students have more poten­
tial roommates to choose from, 
the chance of picking a roommate 
who is compatible with them in­
creases, which would mean less 
work for the University in deal­
ing with roommate problems and 
situations that arise.
One argument against coed 
rooming is that couples would 
room together. But what is wrong 
with that? Why should I care if 
my friend and his girlfriend want 
to room together? If they think 
they could handle living together 
and still pass all their classes, I 
say go for it. They could just as 
easily move off campus and live 
together. I would rather have my 
friends room together and stay 
on campus where they are closer 
socially than have them move off 
campus to an apartment 15 min­
utes away and become withdrawn 
from the rest of their friends.
Also, they could basically room 
together as it is, if they wanted 
to. The difference is that, with 
coed rooms, far fewer roommates 
would end up being sexiled for 
the night.
Coed rooms would make CMU 
a happier place in which to live. 
I say let’s ask the administration 
to at least allow us to try 
coed rooms in one dorm and see 
how it works out. If we could run 
this program properly, it could 
be a wonderful success for 
the University.

Soccer needs time to establish itself
From the Touch Line
by Nathan Steinwald
This summer, soccer enthusi­
asts around the world will get 
their fix when France hosts the 
world’s premiere national teams 
for a month and a half to deter­
mine who gets bragging rights for 
the next four years as home of the 
best soccer players on the planet. 
Among the teams will be the 
United States, which has now 
qualified for its third World Cup 
in a row. How far has United States 
soccer progressed since ’94 when 
it held the Cup? How well will the 
national team do in France? These 
questions, though related, might 
actually have different answers.
Let’s start with the second ques­
tion first, and we’ll see where that 
takes us. In ’94, the U.S. earned a 
trip out of the first round into the 
elimination rounds. Unfortunately, 
the U.S. was eliminated right away 
by Brazil, who would go on to win 
the entire toumament.The team 
was able to draw with Mexico twice. 
Mexico is still considered the best 
team in North America.
The U.S. was able to beat Brazil 
in a friendly match this year. The 
win is arguably the best in U.S. 
soccer history, rivaling only the 
defeat of the English in England 
in the 1950 World Cup. Brazil was 
actually shamed by their loss this 
year, which is slightly insulting, 
but since we won, such insults can 
be tolerated.
That’s about how the U.S. would 
be standing going into France, if 
the team wasn’t hampered by in­
juries. Last year Tab Ramos, one 
of the best U.S. midfielders ever, 
suffered a tom ACL for the sec­
ond time in his career. Ramos
Apply to join pilgrimmage to Ghana
The Carnegie Mellon Action project and the Office of 
the President are pleased to announce the sponsor­
ship for one student to participate in the Urban 
League of Pittsburgh's 8oth Anniversary Pilgrimmage 
to Ghana, the Ivory Coast and Senegal this June 27th 
through July 4th.
Selection for this special opportunity to represent 
the university will be based on academic standing, 
campus leadership and community service, and a 
brief essay (500-1,000 words) detailing compelling 
reasons for wishing to be part of this special event. 
Special consideration will be given to the explicit 
cultural relevance of this journey for the individual 
chosen. It is expected that the person selected will 
be committed to sharing this experience with others 
upon his/her return, perhaps through a workshop or 
campus lecture, so the opportunity is only open to 
students who will not be graduating this May. The 
essay of application, plus any other information you 
care to share detailing your academic and co-cur- 
ricular involvements, must be received in the CMAP 
Office by April 30th. The selection will be made by a 
committee of students, faculty and staff, with a 
decison announced by May 7th.
Questions may be directed to Dean Michael Murphy at X8-2075 or mmiv@andrew.
leads the U.S. team in all-time 
assists in international play and 
is a fierce competitor. His career 
has been troubled by injuries. Not 
only have his ACLs given him 
pains, a Brazilian midfielder also 
fractured Ramos’ skull in ’94 
when he intentionally launched 
an elbow at the American’s head.
Ramos is confident he will be 
ready to return at top form for the 
Cup, but only time will tell. As if 
that wasn’t enough, Eric Wynalda 
was injured in the first week of 
Major League Soccer (MLS) play. 
The U.S. is still left with a tal­
ented team, but it is lacking some
don’t count on it. Iran is the best 
chance for a U.S. win. Anything 
less would be a disappointment.
Yugoslavia and the U.S. will 
probably be pretty evenly 
matched, and with the presence 
of the Germans in our pool, both 
teams will be desperate for a vic­
tory. The U.S. will need to win 
this match, not only to get to the 
second round but also to get a 
good seed in the later rounds.
Assuming all goes well, the U.S. 
should make it to the second round. 
I wouldn’t count on much more 
than that though. The chances of 
the U.S. meeting a premiere team 
in the second round are pretty high, 
and like in ’94 when Brazil was too 
much for the U.S., we should ex­
pect a close game, but a loss for 
our national team.
Having said all of that, I 
return to the beginning
of the leadership and experience 
it was hoping to have.
Finally we arrive at the actual 
World Cup. The United States 
opens up against Germany, gets a 
brief respite against Iran, and 
closes the first round of play 
against Yugoslavia. The draw isn’t 
easy by any measure, but the U.S. 
might be able to climb into the 
second round again. Ramos has 
said that the only hope against 
Germany is that the U.S. plays a 
perfect match. Germany has occa­
sionally started the tournament 
slowly so a tie might be possible 
against the mighty Germans, but

and well. The two measuring sticks 
I have chosen are the MLS and 
youth soccer in the United States.
There has been a good deal of 
concern over the viability of the 
MLS recently. This year, a num­
ber of expansion teams were 
added in the hope of increasing 
audiences and revenues. To this
point in the season, attendance 
hasn’t been better than last year. 
There is even some talk of fran­
chises being relocated in search 
of stronger markets.
Popular opinion has placed 
responsiblity for increasing atten­
dance on the national team’s per­
formance in France. A few players 
have even made statements about 
it, but the way I see it, all the 
weight isn’t on the backs of the 
U.S. team. Obviously the better 
the team does, the more U.S. audi­
ences will time in. Soccer has the 
luck of competing against baseball 
for viewers. Some people might be 
upset by my saying that, but the 
fact is that interest in baseball is 
still suffering from the effects of 
the strike a few years ago. If the 
American team plays as well as 
they can audiances will tune in;
The league will take time to 
grow to the point where it consis­
tently fills stadiums. This sum­
mer will see some improvement, 
but to be honest, the future be­
longs to the younger generation. 
Soccer has spread across the coun­
try to become one of the most 
popular sports among children.
In addition to more people play­
ing soccer, the U.S. is bringing up 
more highly talented players. This 
year the MLS signed its first high 
school player who gave up college to 
sign a pro contract. MLS is different 
thanbasketball in that players who 
choose skip to the pros get money 
put aside for them by the league for 
college. The importance of this is 
two fold though. AU.S. soccer player 
is valuedhighly enoughfortheMLS 
to take a large chance on him, and 
he actually has a place to play. In 
the past, European leagues gave 
only a limited number of players 
the chance to play at a pro level. 
Now with our own league, talented 
players have a place to compete and 
help raise the overall level of play in 
our country.

Weather torments CMU golfers
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Lightning, torrential downpours, 
48 degree temperatures, 30 mile- 
per-hour winds, and wind chills in 
the 20s have not stopped the 
Carnegie Mellon golf team from 
exceeding expectations and turn­
ing in standout rounds this season. 
The young team features four up­
perclassmen, including seniors 
Jean-Phillippe Talmon, Dave 
Talmon, and team captain Mike 
Kang. In addition to solid perfor­
mances by these senior members of 
the team, surprisingly strong years 
by the numerous sophomores and 
first-year students like freshmen 
Jamie Brown and Jason Lawrence 
have provided the team with added 
fuel and a bright future.
The team’s season opened with 
the beginning of spring break on 
March 21 and their spring train­
ing trip to Pinehurst Country Club 
in North Carolina. The training 
was to be a solid week of golf — 
waking up at 6:00 am in order to 
get in 36 holes per day. En route to 
North Carolina, however, the team 
stopped off in West Virginia to 
compete in the Concord College 
Invitational. The mood for the sea­
son was set on that trip — the team 
drove three hours in pouring rain 
to arrive in Pipestem only to have 
the tournament rained out. The 
remainder of the trip and subse­
quent training was much more pro­
ductive, however — the Tartan 
swingers played 10 rounds in 7 
days including an informal match
against Brown University.
The spring training in sunny 
Carolina did not prepare the team 
for the harsh New England spring 
weather they would face when the 
season began, however. CMUs first 
tournament of the year was the 
LaRoche Invitational at Wildwood 
Country Club. The temperature 
was a balmy 70 degrees but that 
did not make up for 30-mile-per 
hour gusts of wind.
“It was one of the first times I’d 
seen the guys teeing off on a 230 
yard par three with a driver,” said 
head golf coach Rich Erdelyi.
Despite the gales, the team 
turned in an exceptional round, 
taking first place overall in the 
four team tournament. In addi­
tion, Lawrence shot the day’s low­
est overall score as he finished 
seven over par with 79.
The team’s next tournament was 
the Speidel Invitational in Wheel­
ing, West Virginia on April Fool’s 
Day. The Tartans would settle for 
third overall, with Lawrence and 
sophomore Brian Schuster tied for 
team-best rounds.
The weather continued to be a 
nemesis to the team as they trav­
eled to New England on April 5 
and played in the Engineer’s Cup, 
hosted by the MIT. The practice 
round may have been mistaken for 
a mid-December football game in 
Green Bay as snow flurries fell 
through a 38-degree wind. “[It] 
was the coldest nine holes I’ve ever 
played,” said Erdelyi.
The weather cleared somewhat 
for the tournament but the Tar­
tans still had to play though harsh 
wind in order to place second out of 
four schools, topped only by 
Worchester Polytechnic Institute. 
The four-year letter winner Kang 
led the team that day with a 11- 
over-par 87 round.
In a year that has featured so 
many inclement conditions, includ­
ing two lightning delays against 
Washington and Jefferson College, 
the golf team is performing ex­
tremely well. “They’re exceeding 
all my expectations,” said Erdelyi.
Next up for the Tartans is the 
NCAA District II Tournament in 
Hershey, Pennsylvania this up­
coming weekend. Erdelyi says that 
they are aimingfor atop four finish 
against highly-ranked teams such 
as the University of Rochester, the 
College of New Jersey, and Allegh­
eny College.
From there, the Tartans will host 
the University Athletic Associa­
tion Championships at their home 
course of Longue Vue Country 
Club. Erdelyi hopes to be able to 
challenge four-time reigning UAA 
Champion Emory University.
The golf season will finish on the 
last week of classes when the team 
will travel to Rochester, New York 
and play at the Oakhill Country 
Club — one of the finest golfcourses 
in the world. The invitational, 
hosted by the University of Roch­
ester, will feature some Division 1 
and nationally-ranked teams like 
Skidmore, Colgate, and Cornell. 
The tournament will cap off a year 
of growth and rebirth of the 
Carnegie Mellon golf team.Track team improves at IUP meet
TRACK, from page 8
women’s team consisted of sopho­
more Melinda Hungerman, Pow­
ers, first-year student Katie 
Janes, and sophomore Amy 
Antoci. The men’s team was com­
prised of sophomore Brian 
Knudsen, Plesko, senior George 
Matcuk, and freshman Ed 
Murphy. Knudsen also ran a per­
sonal best in the 800 with a time 
of 1:58.
Off of the track and on the field 
the Carnegie Mellon team contin-
ued to do well. Senior Jessica 
Connolly was a first place finisher 
in both the long jump and triple 
jump. Sophomore Todd Kozuki 
placed first in the triple jump with 
first-year student Allen Ednie 
right behind him in second place. 
To help add to the heap of first 
place finishes senior Chris Pesci 
beat out the competition for the 
right to stand on .the first place 
podium in the high jump.
First year student Matt Gustin 
threw the discus a distance of 123
feet, setting a personal best, but 
he has been struggling in the 
shotput. Earlier this year, Gustin 
won the indoor UAA champion­
ships in the shotput, but this 
weekend was three feet off hi!s 
best mark.
With the IUP meet behind them 
the team has two more meets to 
prepare for the UAA champion­
ships. “I think little by little we’re 
coming along and we’ll have the 
team ready by the conference 
meet,” said coach Dario Donatelli.

Rich teams must share wealth
The Squeeze Play
by Peter Patterson
It’s all about the Benjamins, baby. As 
a new season of major league baseball 
lacks off, Puff Daddy s track could serve 
as a theme song for the sport. Baseball 
r owners who wonder why their sport is 
losing ground to basketball and football 
need to look no further than their own 
spending habits.
Exhibit 1: Wayne Huizenga,
.Florida Marlins. In 1997, the 
pwner decides he wants to win 
a World Series, so he dishes 
out $47,738,000 in salaries, 
seventh most in the majors.
This team of hired guns pro­
ceeds to fulfill the expectations 
by winning the championship, 
only to see 11 of their 25 players 
cut loose in an effort to slash 
the team’s payroll. Gone are 
ace Kevin Brown, Moises 
Alou, and closer Robb Nenn,
, the team’s best players. How can 
. someone be a loyal Marlins fan when 
foalf his team is auctioned off to the 
, highest bidder?
,, Exhibit 2: Jerry Reinsdorf, Chicago 
. White Sox. First, he throws the baseball 
. salary structure out of whack by signing 
-Albert Belle to a salary paying him $10 
^million a year. Then, with his team three 
. games out of first place in July, he dumps
* Wilson Alvarez, Danny Darwin, Roberto 
[ Hernandez, and Harold Baines. Asked to 
, explain, he told reporters, “Anybody who 
thinks we’ll catch the Indians is crazy.”
In my opinion, anybody who is a 
diehard White Sox fan must be going 
..crazy putting up with an owner who 
throws in the towel with his team well 
„within striking distance in order to 
save a few bucks.
There is a new power structure in 
major league baseball, and its order is 
evident upon looking at the team sala­
ries in the league. The team with the 
highest payroll this season, the Balti­
more Orioles, pays its players over seven 
times that of the lowest salaried team, 
the Montreal Expos. Albert Belle, Gary 
Sheffield, and Greg Maddux each earn 
more than the entire Expos roster. I’m 
not a math major, but to me this adds up 
to an uneven level of competition. Re­
cent results have supported this idea, as 
last year’s playoffteamsallhadpay-

rolls over $30 
million, and 
five out of the 
seven top-paying 
teams made the playoffs, including even­
tual World Series participants Cleve­
land and Florida. In the past, the recipe 
for winning in baseball was a good farm 
system and solid management. Now it 
is having a deep-pocketed owner, a new 
stadium, and a large local TV deal.
Luckily for baseball fans and the sport, 
the games aren’t played on paper. There
could always be a team like last year’s 
Pirates, who competed for the central 
division championship despite having 
the lowest payroll in the league. How­
ever, it is hard for fans in cities such as 
Montreal, Pittsburgh, Oakland, and 
Cincinnati to get excited about their 
teams when their caliber of players 
doesn’t stack up to teams with pay­
rolls two to three times as much.
What can baseball do to remedy the 
problem? Number one, a commis­
sioner needs to be hired. Bud Selig is 
not a bad man, but until an unbiased 
overseer for the game is hired, the 
owners are not going to be con­
trolled. Increased revenue shar­
ing could also greatly help the 
sport. Income from stadi­
ums and local TV deals 
should be split evenly 
amongst the teams, 
which would greatly
> help smaller market 
teams compete mon­
etarily. A strict sal­
ary cap should be insti­
tuted, as the current 
luxury tax on payrolls over 
$55 million doesn’t seem to 
deter rich owners from over­
spending. A minimum sal­
ary cutoff should also be 
instituted, in order to put 
all payrolls at least in the 
same ballpark.
The sport of baseball is not 
irreparably harmed, but the situ­
ation will just continue to get worse 
until action is taken. Meanwhile, 
look for the competition to once again 
be slanted in the direction of teams 
with the highest payrolls. Baltimore, 
New York, and Cleveland should 
compete for the right to play Atlanta 
in the World Series. What do these 
teams have in common? They are 
the four teams that pay their players 
over $59 million. It’s all about the 
Benjamins, baby.

dent in the University Choice Program.

ing but positive right from the start. We 
are enthusiastic, motivated, and very sup­
portive of one another. I think out of any 
other organization out on the hills, we 
must have the most team spirit,” said 
junior Teresa Palonis, who joined SDC as 
a sophomore transfer. “These are some of 
the best friends I have ever had,” she said.
SDC is so happy all of the time that it 
makes some other teams on the hills 
sick. SDC buggy people are constantly 
excited, peppy, and motivated, and it is 
this drive that keeps them together as a 
team. While many other people wander 
off to sleep more or eat something on 
Sunday mornings at 9 am, they huddle 
together behind their truck and cheer 
aloud for themselves on another great 
day of work.
On another part of the course, the 
Beta Theta Pi (Beta) men’s teams stood 
together and scowled into the sun. The 
conversation flowed from the freezing 
weather to donut runs. Who are these 
guys, really? Athletes to be sure, football 
and baseball players, but more impor­
tantly pushers with an athlete’s sense of 
determination and a strong work ethic. 
Surely it takes good parts suppliers, 
smart designers, and a cock-sure atti­
tude to gain respect and build a winning 
buggy program, but it is the fleet-footed, 
thick-calved pushers that are the gas. 
And Beta’s gas is high-octane.
Senior push captain Rick Steiner has 
something to prove to himself and to the 
rest of the programs — that Beta, com­
ing in second last year in the shortened 
races, was no fluke. The teams want to 
roll faster and run harder.
Steiner runs a smooth ship, floating 
back and forth from one group of push­
ers to another, gathering times and di­
recting his course-watchmen left and 
right. In his house, he says, the title of 
push captain is an honorary one that 
goes to the pusher with the most experi­
ence. He has four years of it.
He doesn’t tell a new guy what to do, 
just lets him feel out the buggy for him­
self. The veterans may help a little with 
some technique, but basically it’s about 
learning how to move one’s body the 
most efficient way that one can. Every­
one is different; there is no set Beta 
pushing program. Some bump and shove 
and some one-arm push.
Other organizations send spies to 
nonchalantly walk by Beta at night rolls 
and cast glances at the muscled men 
flying up Hill 3. The Betas laugh, chew 
some more sunflower seeds, and shrug 
their shoulders or scream exaggerat­
edly into their walkie-talkies to “move 
this” or “open that hill” or “shine the 
light there,” even though they are thirty 
feet away from each other. If they are 
struggling at all, they aren’t showing it.
Beta had 10 or 15 guys coming out at 
night last week, but were hard-pressed 
to put-together three teams for all-out 
rolls on truck weekend. No worries, 
though. They were taking everything in 
stride, including qualifying Occam: their 
new, blue, hammer-head buggy, built in 
the style of Unforgiven (1996).
The determination is there. Anyone 
who sees them tear up and down the 
hills, pushing it to the limit when the 
push bar is in hand, knows this. Like 
any good athletes, they know when to be 
serious and when to have fun. They 
leave the game behind on the hills.
It’s hard to get a straight answer out 
of anyone in this group. They tease 
themselves — “we’re fat, we’re slow, 
our buggies suck” — and poke fun at 
other teams’ broken wheels and spins, 
but will also jump to help any organiza­
tion that needs help with something 
(while at the same time sneakily quali­
fying Occam by serving as pass-test 
guinea pigs).
“We’re looking very sharp,” said se­
nior Chris Barnicle about Beta’s Race 
Days chances. “Let’s hope that our beer 
guts don’t hold us back.”

CMU prepares for 
Sweepstakes race
By JESSICA STRELITZ
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Junior Kristen Williams, sweepstakes 
safety chair, is pacing around the top of 
Hill One jumping in and out of chase 
cars, watching pass tests and taking 
notes. Her to-do list is a page long and 
she’s really cold, but she’s smiling. “It’s 
almost done,” she sighs. “The last day of 
Truck Weekend.” Along with the U- 
Hauls and Ryder trucks come 13 organi­
zations with 13 different agendas and 
the piecing together of race teams. Ev­
eryone says that they’re not timing each 
other, but stopwatches click and beep as 
each new buggy rolls through the tran­
sition zones on the back hills. Mechanics 
with three-day-old scruff fret over every 
bolt and windshield. Phi Kap flips, Kappa 
Sig just stops and Beta’s blue bomber 
rolls painfully slowly through the shoot. 
Spirit and PiKA are neck and neck by 
. most people’s timers and there are six 
days left until the first day of races.
From the Sweepstakes rules book: team 
(n): a group of six people, consisting of
SDC men’s program 100 percent. While 
other programs drag their women’s 
teams out of bed to do night rolls at 3:30, 
don’t encourage their girls to come out 
as a team until days before Race Week­
end, or dump their women’s program 
entirely, SDC racing depends on their 
women for support: moral, mechanical, 
flagging, timing, and pushing.
On Tuesday night before Truck Week­
end, senior push captain Sara Frew put 
her women through the paces on Hill 
Four. The men and women took alter­
nate turns, pushing and shoving for one 
another, while Frew was pacing them, 
clapping her hands and cheering “Come 
on!” She was processing in her mind — 
who will be Hill Four, Team A; how about 
Hill Five, Team C? Even as she set the 
teams, she was keeping everyone moving 
and running their best, despite the bad 
weather and cool conditions. As a push 
captain, this is how Frew runs things.
“I think it is wonderful that SDC has a 
woman push captain to address specific 
concerns that the women might have, 
without dividing up the teams,” said se-

one driver and five pushers, all of whom 
are currently enrolled, Activities Fee 
paying, full-time, undergraduate stu­
dents of Carnegie Mellon University. It 
takes mechanics to build and maintain, 
drivers to steer and encourage, and a 
chairman to organize it all, but pushers 
make the buggies go. Pushers, five of 
them at a time, band together in these 
last days before races and become a team.
Student Dormitory Council (SDC) rac­
ing has one of the strongest reputations 
for women’s buggy teams. They might 
not be the strongest female pushers on 
the hills, but they serve as equals to the
nior Chelsea Mamell, A-team pusher and 
SDC’s women’s push captain last year 
both push captains work with everyone. 
“I think having women in positions of 
leadership within the buggy organiza­
tion makes it easier for women to feel 
comfortable with the team.”
“For me, seeing my team’s enthusi­
asm makes the push captain experience 
great. When a new pusher’s face lights 
up with excitement after pushing for the 
first time, I realize why I’m out there. I 
know it’s cheesy, but it’s true,” said Frew.

Track team rolls on at IUP
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
How do members of the Carnegie 
Mellon track team feel about last 
Saturday’s meet at Indiana University 
of Pennsylvania (IUP)? “It is always 
nice to go to their meet and whup them,” 
said junior Kristopher Kreichbaum.
How did the competition feel about 
this? “You guys stuck on my ass like it 
was going out of style,” said an IUP 
runner who saw his lead in the 5000m 
event fade into a fourth place finish 
behind three CMU runners.
For the second week in a row, the 
track team did well, building itself up 
for the UAA conference meet in At­
lanta. Some of the runners who showed 
well at the Carnegie Mellon meet 
didn’t make the trip to IUP, but for 
the rest of the team it was a successful 
meet, despite needing to battle winds. 
First place finishes and personal bests 
highlighted the meet.
For the second meet in a row, CMU 
swept the top three spots in the men’s 
5000m race. This week sophomore 
Kenn Oldham finished first with a 
time of 15:30. Behind him, Kreichbaum 
placed second with a time of 15:33, and 
sophomore Bryan Meyer came in third 
with a time of 15:36. CMU was also 
able to get another runner in at sixth 
place when senior Maliek Washington 
finished with a time of 15:50.
“The key to the 5000 was to get started 
fast enough to hang on behind the leaders 
going into the wind, until we could pass 
them at the end of the race,” said Oldham.
The 5000m event was also Meyer’s 
second event of the day. Earlier, he led 
Carnegie Mellon’s 1500m run­
ners by finishing first with a 
time of 4:11.9. “It’s the first 
1500m race I’ve run for outdoor 
this year ... so I didn’t know 
what to expect,” said Meyer, who 
added, “I drafted for most of the 
race, and then with 1500 meters 
to go I made a strong surge.”
Sophomore Ryle Goodrich 
came in third for CMU with a 
finish of 4:18.0 and Sophomore 
Mark Plesko came in fourth 
with a 4:20.0 finish.
The 1500m event went well 
for the women as well as the 
men. Junior Margaret Powers 
placed second and Sophomore 
Andrea Byrnes finished third.
“I was a little disappointed be­
cause it was a second slower 
than last week, and I would 
have liked to run a national 
provisional qualifying time,” 
said Powers. She only has to 
remove two seconds from her 
time from this weekend to earn 
a provisional qualifier.
Sophomore Melissa Sloan fin­
ished second in the women’s
5000m, an event that she was running 
for the first time, with a time of 19:02.
Other racing highlights included the 
third place finish of both the women’s 
and men’s 4x400m racing teams. The

Baseball club begins new season
By STACEY REED
Tartan Staffwriter
Nothing like'the sound of a bat 
spanking a new baseball to wake one 
out of hibernation. Yes, my friends, 
baseball season is here! Not wanting 
to be left out, the CMU club team hit 
the field.last weekend with a double- 
header against the Community Col­
lege of Allegheny, Boyce Campus. For 
the first time in their 1997-1998 sea­
son, our boys brought home two wins, 
8-land 11-3.
Senior Jon Zubiller, team co-cap- 
tain, said, “We played two awesome 
games, possibly the best I’ve seen in 
my CMU career.”
The pitching staff was on the ball all 
afternoon, beginning with senior co­
captain Jay McCormack, who pitched 
the first five innings, followed by fifth- 
year senior Albie Fletcher, who fin­
ished the game.
Though pitching and fielding were 
top-notch, the action didn’t stop 
there. Sophomore Matt Bostick led
the bat pack at the plate, coming up 
with three doubles for his three at- 
bats. Sophomore shortstop Justin 
Peroli had some advice for future pitch­
ers facing Bostick: “The moral of the 
story is, don’t throw this guy fastballs.” 
Other intimidators at the plate in­
cluded juniors Mike Porpora and Alex 
Skroupa. Sophomore Russ Clay 
smacked a single and a double, scoring 
three runs during the course of the 
game. The game ended with a score of 
CMU eight, Boyce one.
Junior Jon Mayes started the second 
game on the mound, pitching four in­
nings. Junior Steve Wetter followed him 
for two innings, easing back into his 
pitching after missing practice due to a 
broken hand. Freshman Tony Paez got 
the save, finishing the last inning.
Junior Ramon Poo was back in action 
after a great performance in the fall 
season, hitting a triple and scoring three 
runs. The Master of the plate was, once 
again, Bostick, who belted out a home 
run and a single, scoring four RBIs. 
Bostick may have some competition for
the team slugger, as freshman Brian 
Rozinski had three hits, two of which 
were doubles, scoring twice himself and 
batting in three runs. Game two score: 
CMU 11, Boyce three.
“I’m excited for our prospects this 
season,” said winning pitcher Mayes. 
“As long as we put our best team on the, 
field, I think we stand a chance of put­
ting a quality record on the board.”
The big story of the day was the pitch­
ing. “We’ve been working hard on our 
control and location. It’s really paid 
off,” said coach Bob Janeda. Through­
out both games, the pitchers gave up no 
walks and were consistently ahead of 
the batters.
“We have two strong players at every 
position and I’m not afraid to play any­
one.” said Janeda. “This is the most 
talented team I’ve seen in my two years 
at CMU.”
The team has a doubleheader at home 
(Mellon Park) this Thursday at 2pm 
against Community College South, 
and another next Thursday away at 
Allegheny College.

"Our B team driver, Ed “Barbig" 
Parker, our newest driver, has also 
been instructed to win Sweepstakes,

Our B team should be better than usual,

probably will because their buggy/ 
driver combination sucks! 2) Beta — 
only if they dont spin, but I doubt it. 
3) PiKA — their pushers look good, 
but not as good as they have been in 
the past.'
"And women: 1) Spirit — You just 
cant beat them, unless they spin. 2) 
Zoo —The Thetas will put the smack 
down on the competition. 3) PiKA — It 
doesn’t really matter who pushes, their 
buggies are good."

this isn't a drinking contest."
“We haven’t really been paying at­
tention to other teams, there's not 
much point to it. As long as we're 
getting faster, there isn't much else we 
can do. Timing other people's push.,

From the Carnival Chairperson:
Spring Carnival is upon us once again and the Morewood 
Parking lot is transformed into a land of myths and legends 
with games, rides and entertainment. This year the carnival 
committee is out to prove that anyone can be a part of the 
action with the introduction of “Blitz Booth,” open to any 
group of faculty, students, or staff. We hope that the increased 
diversity on the midway and increased participation benefits 
the entire campus community.
There are also several events scheduled this year that we 
hope to see you at! Activities Board has a great concert sched­
ule on Saturday afternoon and the carnival committee has 
brought in Darrell Hammond from Saturday Night Live to 
take you into the the last evening of Carnival. We also have 
very special events planned on Saturday afternoon to enter­
tain the child in all of us with magicians and jugglers on the 
Midway.
Spring Carnival takes coundess hours of hard work from 
a committee of very dedicated and energetic people. I would 
like to thank all of the committee members for their tireless 
efforts in leading their committees and getting the job done. 
All of the members of the carnival committee are 
hardworking individuals devoting their spare time to bring 
you a fabulous event. Please join me in thanking them for 
their efforts!
Planning for Spring Carnival 1998 began a few weeks af­
ter Carnival 1997 and it takes an amazing amount of effort 
from all die parties involved. A special thanks to the admin­
istration for their support and to all 
the people in Facilities Management 
Services, Parking, and Retail Services 
for their hard work.
I hope that everyone will enjoy the 
fruits of our labor, and I’ll see you on 
the Midway!

and the premier of Maria Sensi’s Lilas Ombre, a student work. Kilts are optional.
Once again Orquesta Tropical will provide a bright Latin beat during the first night of Carnival. It’s sure to get your toes tapping and

Comedy tonight: a pair of commedians take the stage
At eight o' clock on the Midway 
stage, the Carnival crowds will have 
the opportunity to watch a comic 
who enjoys en­
tertaining all 
kinds of audi­
ences, even 
college stu­
dents. He says,
"I enjoy per­
forming every­
where, from 
the downtown 
Manhattan 
nightclubs, to 
colleges, to 
corporations, and even religious 
events. Having clean material gives 
me the freedom to work all over."
But just because Gary Greenberg 
is comfortable with general audi­
ences doesn't mean you won't have a 
good time. He's 
impressed and en­
tertained crowds 
at Notre Dame, 
University of Con­
necticut, and 
Rowan College. 
Even an NYU stu­
dent commented 
that, "It's hard to 
make a jaded col­
lege student 
laugh. [But] his 
stuff is totally refreshing."
For material, he searches out the 
surreal and the bizarre. And, as to
the sources of his comedy, he notes 
that his upbringing was a little un­
usual, "My parents were always expos­
ing me to interesting and strange 
things. Monkeys on roller skates, 
beer-drinking donkeys, life-size man­
nequins hopping around the living 
room on electric pogo sticks - this 
was my childhood."
Last year he was hailed as one of 
New York's City's top clean comics 
when he performed in the New 
York/Toyota Comedy Festival, and is 
currently a contributing writer on 
Comedy Central's The Daily Show. 
What better way to get into the Car­
nival mood than hearing great live 
comedy?

Steven Sondheim’s Deadly Musical, “Assassins”
The musical considers the course 
of American history from the point 
of the view of presidential assassins 
and would-be assassins. The audi­
ence is take through the despair and 
pain that generates this special type 
of the lost men and women. The 
musical itself is a consideration of the
sort of reasoning and loss that the as­
sassins display and feel, and the im­
plications for America. The scenes of 
history, taken from time, and 
reimagined by a master lyricist and 
musician provide a magic windows 
into human nature. The play origi­
nally opened December 19, 1990.
Scotch ‘n’ Soda production will 
use CMU’s local talent to bring this 
musical to life. And, don’t worry if 
you can’t attend the presentation: 
the musical is also being shown (in 
Rangos Hall) on Thursday at 8 pm, 
Friday at 8 pm, and Saturday at 5 and 
8 pm.
The spectacle of live performance 
continues Thursday night at 9:00 PM 
on the Main stage with a program of 
comedy and ventriloquism from 
Lynn Trefzger. Lynn brings together 
amazing figure manipulation with ex­
ceptional vocal skills to delight her 
audiences. Another veteran per­
former, she has been entertaining au­
diences since 1977, with a string of 
recent awards for her ventriloquism.
Trefzger’s inventive routines are 
acclaimed for their originality and 
wit. Characters, dummies, voices and 
inanimate objects will blend together 
into a wild comedic world. She's 
been seen at Disney's Comedy Ware­
house, Lifetime's Girls Night Out, 
ABC's Good Morning America, and 
A&E's Comedy on the road. You

The Boilermaker Jazz Band is one 
of the only bands in American play­
ing the authentic New Orleans style, 
a style born of brass bands, spiritu­
als, and American ‘hot’ jazz stan­
dards during the early 1900’s. The 
Boilermaker Jazz Band features the 
Cosentino brothers—Led by Paul on 
clarinet, Jay on trombone, and An­
drew on trumpet. Inspired at a young 
age by die recordings of jazz pioneers 
like Louis Armstrong, George Lewis, 
“Big” Jim Robinson, and the 
Humphreys, the brothers carry on a 
family tradition of jazz which was 
handed down to them by their grand- 
fadier, Mario DeLuca, a pianist in 
New York during the swing era. 
Other featured players include: Dan 
Davisson on banjo, a strong strum- 
mer in the four-beat style; Nelson 
Harrison on piano, veteran on the
Count Basie j 
Orchestra;
Rich Strong 
on drums, 
rolling out 
parade riffs; 
and Ernest 
McCarty on 
bass, who 
toured for 
over five years 
with Erroll 
Garner.
The Boil­
ermaker Jazz 
Band was 
formed at 
C a r n e g i e 
Mellon Uni­
versity in 1988, and is based in Pitts­
burgh. The band has toured coast- 
to-coast in the United States as well
as overseas to play at top jazz festi­
vals, clubs and jazz societies.

From out of Berkeley, the same 
area as jazz giants Joshua Redman 
and Benny Green, comes Charlie 
Hunter and his eight string guitar. At 
a mere 27, Charlie Hunter “performs 
all the usual feats of a rising jazz star 
—playing sprightiy post-bop solos 
laying out tasty basslines, plucking 
supple chordal accompaniments —
only he does it at once, bass in one 
amp and guitar in the other.” Influ­
enced by his mother, a guitar re­
pairer, Charlie took up the guitar at 
age 12. Jazz was something Charlie 
found on his own, and really got into 
it. “He realizes that his homespun 
pedagogy was anything but a disad­
vantage.”
Charlies Hunter Trio plays music 
that is a fusion of greats such as 
Thelonious Monk, James Brown and 
Rahsaan Kirk, though the music is 
deeply rooted in the harmonies and 
melodies of Joe Pass, John Coltrane 
and Charlie Parker.
Six A Capella groups will perform in three hours! It’s sure to be a treat.

Another band with a strong local 
following, the Dharma Sons in one 
form or another have been around
since 1993. Their latest CD, Fit, came 
out last year, and listeners of local 
modern rock stations will immedi­
ately recognize their “Come on Ev­
erybody.” The band’s lineup consists 
of Rob Bayne on guitar and vocals, 
bassist Matt Dudek, and drummer 
Bill Warnick. The band’s success has 
been an inspiration to many local 
bands, and now you have a chance 
to see them live and in person.
Do we like 
Ike? Sure we do, 
especially if we’ve 
been listening to

their infectious 
sense of fun, and 
a great party vibe, 
the Ike McCoy 
Band promises 
one and all a 
good time this 
Friday evening at 
9 pm on the 
Main Stage.
Since forming 
in 1995, and tak­
ing home a win 
from Whiskey 
Dick’s Unbutt- 
plugged Acoustic 
Challenge, the 
Ike McCoy Band 
has been build­
ing up a loyal fol­
lowing here in Pittsburgh. Their first 
CD, Kids in France are Drunk, they 
came but in 1996. Phillip Harris, writ­
ing in In Pittsburgh, noted that they 
“...prov[ed] yet again that emotion 
and energy are the most important 
elements in rock ‘n’ roll...” Their sec­
ond CD, ...Made Glorious Summer 
came out to acclaim in 1997. This is 
no “second best” talent, but a genu­
ine find that happens to come from 
the ‘Burgh. As Harris put it, “...Made 
Glorious Summer is as good as any na­
tional release you’re likely to hear...” 
Who are the members of the Ike 
McCoy Band? Jamie Bernarding 
sings, Frank Danyo handles guitar, 
Mike Mizia does the bass, and Ray 
Jones plays the drums. Describing 
the band’s sound. Mike Mizia noted 
influences from The Police, Steely 
Dan, and Cream. But perhaps the 
best description is just that they play 
(as their promotional literature puts 
it) “sassy, funky, aggressive pop rock.” 
Come on out and enjoy the party!

Carnival offers varied activities
By GREGORY NOFI
Tartan Staffwriter
Many students say that the Wean 
Hall fire was an event of epic propor­
tions. A lot of other people believe that 
any sunny day in Pittsburgh is a day of 
epic proportions. But the 1998 Spring 
Carnival theme promises even more: “A 
Weekend of Epic Proportions.”
Starting this Thursday at 5 pm, the 
bagpipes will play and the 1998 Spring 
Carnival will officially begin. All of the 
planning, booth building, and 
buggy practicing will finally 
translate into CMU’s biggest 
annual event.
The first Spring Carnival has its roots 
in an event called Campus Week, which 
began in 1920. It was a three-day cel­
ebration that tried to lure alumni back 
to campus during the spring. But after 
nine years of athletic events, carnival 
games, talent shows, and campus 
queens, the event was abolished.
Nevertheless, due to overwhelming 
student appeals, the administration 
permitted a celebration in 1930 called 
Spring Carnival. It has been held annu­
ally since then, except for a few years 
during World War II.
“It’s interesting to see how the Carni­
val has evolved over the years to what 
it is today. It used to be a week-long 
event with egg tosses, tugs of war, and 
other events and games on the Cut,” 
said Barbara Prevost, coordinator of 
Student Activities and advisor for the 
Carnival committee.
As usual, this year’s Carnival offers a 
variety of events all over campus, most 
notably Midway and Sweepstakes. This 
year’s theme for booths is “Myths and 
Legends.” In addition to the 24 regu- 
lar-sized booths run by various

Booth builders bring legends to CMU
By JENNIFER TERRY
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last Friday night, you might have 
seen 30 guys carrying a peppermint 
rooftop up Morewood Avenue, or 
maybe a U-Haul truck with a wooden 
lattice hanging off the end driving 
down Forbes Avenue. Don’t worry; 
it’s just Carnival time again, and the 
booth chairs and committees are 
working hard to get their booths fin­
ished in time for the opening ceremo­
nies Thursday evening.
Midway is the upper section of the 
Morewood parking lot which becomes 
the site of numerous game booths during 
Spring Carnival every year. Most of the 
fraternities and sororities, as well as 
several other campus organizations, 
build a booth on the Midway. Each has to 
fitinto Carnival’s theme, which is “Myths 
and Legends” this year.
Spirit chose to base their booth 
around legendary strongman John 
Henry,according to sophomore Kim Mar­
tin, a mathematical sciences and com­
puter science double major and Spirit’s
booth chair. “We decided on this to be 
our theme because we wanted to show 
the might of Spirit,” said Martin. Their 
game will be the “High Striker,” which 
measures strength.
The Loch Ness monster, the famous 
mystery sea creature from Scotland, 
is Zeta Psi Sigma’s booth theme this 
year. “We’re using a submersible 
pump to circulate water through­
out a large pond which houses 
our game,” said Adele Chiodo,

The best and brightest of Carnegie 
Mellon’s staff and faculty stepped out in 
Weigand Gymnasium last Wednesday 
to show their talents for Campus Celeb­
rities, the kickoff event for the 1998 
Tartan Appreciation Program (TAP).
“The TAP goal is to allow graduating 
seniors an opportunity to say a special 
thank you to someone who made a dif­
ference in their student experience,” said 
Kathy Flynn, one of TAP’s coordinators 
in the Office of Annual Giving.
TAP started with the Class of ’95 
through the Office of Annual Giving. It 
encourages seniors to focus on the im­
portance of their Carnegie Mellon expe­
riences. Over the next few weeks, the 
Reunion Giving Team, consisting of 
Flynn, Dolores Hunter, and. Carole 
Panno of Annual Giving, have a number 
of events planned to encourage senior 
participation in TAP and also to pro­
mote the senior class gift, a tradition 
that began with the Class of’81.
Campus Celebrities featured a num­
ber of deans and faculty members com­
ing from each of CMU’s colleges as well 
as the Office of the Provost. These men 
and women were recruited through the 
Office of Annual Giving’s TAP student 
committee. Each willing performer then 
chose the talent or interest that they 
wanted to present to CMU’s student
body. This program was a way for the 
participants to show their personalities 
outside of the academic setting students 
are accustomed to.
Peter Steams, dean of the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences, had a 
bard time deciding on what his presen­
tation would be about, but finally settled 
on a history project on declining Ameri­
can posture.
“I was going to sing, but with some 
family members because I feel embar­
rassed on my own with [singing],” said 
Stearns. “And while I enjoy a number 
of hobbies, they’re not very interesting 
to discuss — what can one say 
about handball?”
David Owen, associate dean for fac­
ulty and graduate affairs in the Mellon 
College of Science, drew upon his musi­
cal talent for the exhibition. “Playing 
the piano is something I enjoy doing, so 
it was natural to try to resurrect some of 
my skills from years gone by,” he said. 
“It’s easy to share something that is 
important to you and that others might 
also enjoy.”
“Events like this help everyone to see 
how approachable these [deans and fac­
ulty members! are and that they really 
have great personalities. I think every­
one enjoyed hearing Claudia 
Kirkpatrick read fiction and seeing 
Mark Stehlik show off his ’69 Plymouth,” 
said Bryon Krug, a senior electrical and 
computer engineering major, student
body president, and master of ceremo­
nies for the event.
The Honoree Reception, the final TAP 
’98 event, allows seniors who have given 
a gift or pledge of $25.98 or more to meet 
with their honoree, the person who has 
made a difference in their college expe­
rience, one last time before graduation.
“We feel TAP is important to not just 
the seniors, but the entire campus,” said 
Panno. “Many students don’t know ex­
actly what TAP is. Starting this fall 
we’re going to become involved in Orien­
tation and the Activities Fair to make 
students aware of this organization.” 
“The TAP Kickoff Event was very suc­
cessful. It was great to see students 
come out to see their campus celetjri- 
ties,” said Gretchen Dematera, a senior 
social and decision sciences major and 
member of the TAP committee. “I hadno 
idea how talented our deans are.”

“When I go to comic book conven­
tions, I usually speak about the Holo­
caust. When I got to colleges, I usually 
speak about comics.”
So began lecturer and artist Art 
Spiegelman last Tuesday night in 
front of an almost-capacity crowd in 
McConomy Auditorium. Spiegelman 
is an artist and writer of the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning Maus, a book-length 
comic that portrays Germans as cats 
and Jews as mice. But he lectured on 
much more than just comic books.
“[It was] a moving discussion of 
genocide, family relations, and the 
unique narrative properties of com­
ics,” said history graduate student 
Carl Zimring.
“AB has been trying to bring 
Spiegelman [to campus] since last year,” 
said Melissa Chan, a junior chemical 
engineering major and AB Political 
Speakers chair.
AB Political Speakers brings in lec­
turers based on current issues. April 
has Holocaust Awareness Week. “We 
felt that Spiegelman was a very appro- arm hung from a strap. “Typical New 
priate and well-known speaker to have York subway scene,” he said, 
near Holocaust Awareness Week,” The audience laughed, and Spiegelman
Chan said. went on to develop the relationship be-
Brian Smith/Tartan Sports Co-Editor 
Spiegelman’s book-length comic Maus depicts the 
Holocaust as a cat-and-mouse chase.
Spiegelman delivered a slide lecture 
about the relationship between real time 
and time in Maus. “The dead are always 
comingback to haunt us,” he said as a slide 
on his early exposure to comics appeared. 
The comic was Vault ofHorror. Its picture: 
the inside of a subway car, a man’s severed
tween him and his father, Vladek, 
and the Nazi genocide of the Jews 
and the hold it had over both of 
their lives.
“I read Maus a couple of years 
ago and it was really incredible.... 
It was so monumental for me 
since my father is also a survi­
vor,” said sophomore psychology 
major Feige Grundman.
Between puffs from his ciga­
rette, Spigelman explained how 
he was not able to speak at Pitt, 
since they would not allow him to 
smoke during his lecture. “I just 
can’t talk without a cigarette. I’d 
just get confused,” he said.
Spiegelman’s research took him 
to Poland and many of the concen­
tration camps and cities pictured 
in Maus. Often Spiegelman talked 
to survivors and used letters, 
notes, and even thumbnail sketches and 
drawings that prisoners hid in the camps.
“The metaphor for cats and mice 
came from Hitler’s own words,” he said. 
“Dehumanizing is always part of 
genocide. Zyklon B, the gas used in the 
gas chambers, was a pesticide used 
to kill rodents. I had to shovel in tons 
of information.”
In order to do so, Spiegelman relied not 
only on his dialogues with his father, but
also with the medium itself: comics. “ 
graphic influences were the drawings 
that survived the concentration camps. 
It added, or kept, the urgency,” he said. 
“Often, I used a narrative series of dia­
grams. The diagrams showed layouts of 
camps, the ghettos, and secret bunkers.
“Spiegelman creates comics that truly 
take advantage of the unique properties 
of the medium, and has been pushing 
that boundary since before I was bom,” 
said Don Madden, a masters student in 
electrical and computer engineering.
Spielgelman also raised the issue, of 
banned comic books. “There is a lot of 
power to the medium,” he said. “Comics 
echo the actual thought processes in the 
brain. One leaves a book with an idea 
rather than a distinct image, just like 
glancing at a face. It is the idea that is 
threatening to people.”
“It’s a very receptive crowd,” said 
Spiegelman about college audiences' in 
general. “I was surprised that more ques­
tions weren’t asked about the Holocaust,” 
he said. Spiegelman’s lecture fell only 
two weeks before the Fourth Annual 
Holocaust Commemoration on April 23.
“It was probably the best lecture Fve 
seen yet at CMU,” said Marian Goebes, 
a junior civil and environmental engi­
neering major. “My gratitude to AB for 
bringing him.”

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 13 April 1998L3
Various venues help 
celebrate weekend
CARNIVAL, from page LI
Greek and student organizations, 
there will be a new feature called 
Blitz Booth. Blitz Booths follow a 
non-competitive, simplified set of 
rules that reduces the level of 
expertise, labor, and funding that 
is needed to build a regular booth. 
Four organizations have built 
Blitz Booths for Carnival.
“[Blitz Booth] serves as an op­
portunity for organizations who 
could not build booths in the past 
to participate in Carnival,” said 
Margaret Wang, a junior electri­
cal and computer engineering 
major and chairperson of Mid­
way Committee. “The focus of the 
Blitz Booth is primarily on the 
[individual booth’s] game and not 
the construction itself.”
Several other major events are 
planned at Midway in the upper 
Morewood parking lot, which has 
been closed since last Friday. There 
will be several adult and kiddie 
rides, as well as the SDC tent and 
two stages that will feature music 
and comedy. A concession stand 
run by AlphaPhi Omega will round 
out the Midway.
The major Midway attraction 
takes place on Saturday night 
when Darrell Hammond takes the 
main stage. Hammond is a na­
tionally known comedian and Sat­
urday Night Live cast member.
“I don’t think we’ve had a name 
as big as Darrell’s in quite a few 
years,” said Jenna Yerger, chair 
of the Carnival committee and a 
fifth-year senior architecture ma­
jor. “We’re really happy to have 
him come here.”
The other new addition to this 
year’s Midway is the new Satur­
day morning schedule featuring 
jugglers, magicians, and other 
events in an attempt to bring 
local families to Carnival.
“The committee has really 
tried to target schools and 
church groups to come to cam­
pus while many students are 
watching buggy that morning,” 
said Prevost.
Meanwhile, the Sweepstakes 
races will be taking place on the 
other side of campus, near 
Schenley Park. The preliminary 
races start at 8 am on Friday 
morning, and the final races begin 
at the same time on Saturday.
Next door to Schenley Park, 
there will be Mobot Races in front 
of Wean at noon on Friday and 
two local bands on the CFA lawn 
later in the evening.
“We thought the idea of having 
several local bands on Friday night 
would be a good way to warm 
everybody up for the big concert 
on Saturday night,” said Yerger.
That big concert, which is spon­
sored by the Activities Board, is 
a performance by the Jon Spen­
cer Blues Explosion which be­
gins at 7 pm. Two other bands 
will also be performing on the 
CFA lawn that afternoon.
This is only a sampling of the 
events at Carnival. For more infor­
mation, check out the complete 
schedule of events in the supple­
ment in this edition of The Tartan, 
or look at the Carnival web page at 
http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/ 
org/camival.
The Carnival Committee hopes 
that everyone will have a good 
time at this year’s event. But if 
you cannot wait until Thursday, 
t-shirts and hats are on sale for 
$8 each in front of Doherty Hall. 
If you buy them together, they 
cost $15. With every purchase, 
you also get a free frisbee and 
window sticker to help you get in 
the mood for the “Weekend of 
Epic Proportions.”
Events diversify Carnival festivities
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Personnel Manager
There’s booth, and there’s 
buggy. There are rides, bands, 
and comedians. However, in 
addition to these major attrac­
tions, there are several other 
events during Spring Carni­
val that make the weekend 
more social, more diverse, and 
more enjoyable. Such events 
include a mobot competition, 
laser tag game, and Roselawn 
block party.
The Fourth Annual Mobot 
Slalom Race, which starts at 
noon this Friday, April 17, of­
fers an opportunity for students 
to watch races between mobile 
robots designed and built by 
Carnegie Mellon students^. 
These mobots must navigate 
through a series of gates on the 
slalom course, which consists 
of a wavy painted line on the 
pathway in front of Wean Hall. 
Each team will participate in 
three heats of competition, and 
mobots will be judged on how 
accurately and quickly they 
complete the course.
“We started the mobot races 
because we wanted to create an 
activity that would demonstrate 
the skills, talents, and creativ­
ity of the students at Carnegie 
Mellon,” said Catherine 
Copetas, assistant dean for spe­
cial events in SCS. “Although it 
was started in the School of Com­
puter Science, this project is de­
signed to give everyone the op­
portunity to be creative.”
Undergraduate participants 
will be able to use their cre­
ativity to compete for the sat­
isfaction of knowing that they 
built the best mobot, and they 
will also be competing for cash 
prizes: $1000 for first place, $500 
for second place, and $250 for 
third place. Faculty, staff, and 
graduate students may enter the 
“Open Category,” in which a $250 
prize is awarded to the best 
mobot. In addition, a $100 judge’s 
choice award will be given to 
a mobot that the judges feel 
is particularly unique or 
entertaining. The 
sponsors for this 
year’s competition 
are SCS, Lockheed 
Martin, and 
Schlumberger.
“I had a lot of 
fun competing 
in the Mobot 
Slalom Races. It 
was a learning 
experience 
where I got to ap­
ply things I had 
learned in the 
classroom,” said Dan 
Bothell, a Mobot Com­
mittee member, research 
programmer in the Psychol­
ogy Department, and former 
winner of the mobot competi­
tion. Bothell also pointed out 
that the mobot'races offer stu­
dents an opportunity to take 
part in a competition during 
Carnival without having to be a 
member of a large organization.
Another event that will allow 
everyone to get involved is the 
Carnival-sponsored laser tag 
game, which will occur this Sat­
urday, April 18, from noon to 4 
pm in the UC gym. The main 
component of the event will be
laser tag, but there will also be a 
jousting event and a bungee run 
game where students are at­
tached to a bungee cord and race 
each other on a large inflatable 
track. This event will keep stu­
dents busy between the major 
events on Saturday, according to 
Jason Chalecki, a sophomore com-
James Mojonnier/Tartan Art Co-Editor
puter science major and the Sat­
urday event co-chair.
Last year, laser tag was one 
component of an event called 
Carnival within a Carnival, 
which received a very good re­
sponse from the campus commu­
nity, according to Chirag Shah, 
a sophomore electrical and com­
puter engineering major and 
campus programming chair for 
the Student Dormitory Council
(SDC). A few hundred people at­
tended Carnival within a Carni­
val last year; Shah hopes that 
even more people will come by 
this year.
“Last year I went to the laser 
tag with my friends, and it was a 
lot of fun. It gave us something 
else to do besides the main activi­
ties at the midway,” said Renee 
Habib, a sophomore in­
formation and decision 
systems major. “It was 
a good opportunity to 
release our child­
hood instincts and 
run around.”
A block party, 
scheduled for Sat­
urday afternoon at 
Roselawn Terrace, 
will give students 
another opportu­
nity to hang out. 
This event, which 
is sponsored by the 
Roselawn residents, 
SDC, and the fra­
ternities and so­
rorities, will 
consist of food, 
music, and a 
fun place to so­
cialize. The idea be­
hind this event is to bring the 
campus together as a commu­
nity to relax during some of the 
weekend’s free time.
“Saturday afternoon seems to 
be a time when we see a lot more 
of the surrounding community 
coming to campus for Carnival,” 
said Shah. “Thus, we felt that 
there should be things for stu­
dents to do that aren’t involved in 
the celebrations for buggy and 
booth that occur.”

Sweepstakes teams roll towards race day action

A PIKA pusher brings a buggy up Hill 5 during last year’s Sweepstakes competition.
By MATTHEW SOLITRO
Special to The Tartan
Judgment Day arrives in less than one 
week for hundreds of pushers, drivers, 
and mechanics. It is time for the madness 
surrounding Carnegie Mellon’s greatest 
tradition — Sweepstakes, also known as 
Buggy — to swing into full gear.
Every Spring Carnival, fraternities 
and independent organizations run a 
unique relay race around Flagstaff Hill. 
The race involves a team of five pushers 
who take turns powering a small, light­
weight vehicle up a series of hills. In the 
middle of this race is the “freeroll,” where 
the driver maneuvers the buggy down a 
windy hill and speeds through a hairpin 
turn known as the “chute.” The race is a 
delicate balance among precision engi­
neering, nerves of steel, and quick feet.
But that’s not the whole story. Hun­
dreds of hours and dollars go into each 
two- to three-minute race. Freeroll prac­
tices take place each weekend morning to 
train drivers and test new buggy technol­
ogy. Weeks of push practices late at night 
are used to practice pushing form and 
select the five fastest pushers who will be 
part of each organization’s A team. On 
top of that, mechanics pour their hearts
and souls into creating new buggies and 
keeping new advances a secret.
Buggy might be the only event, other 
than a random prank fire alarm at 
Morewood, that can wake up hundreds 
of students at 5 am on a Saturday morn­
ing. Many people not involved in Buggy 
do not understand the appeal of stuff­
ing tiny people into torpedoes on wheels
and pushing them around on a frigid 
morning. What motivates these driv­
ers, pushers, and mechanics to sacrifice 
sleep and safety?
Some team members really cannot ex­
plain why they are a part of it. They just 
got roped into waking up one morning, 
and once they drove or pushed a buggy, 
they knew they were hooked. “Buggy is
like a disease,” said Pioneers mechanic 
and pusher Mike Dutt, a senior chemi­
cal engineering major. “Once you get it, 
you can’t get rid of it.”
For some students, the thrill of compe­
tition or the need for speed pushes them 
to the hills each morning. “When you are 
part of an organization that has the 
ability to win, why not do everything 
possible to make it happen,” said PiKA 
mechanic Rick Simmons, a junior chemi­
cal engineering major.
Many mechanics will tell you that there 
is nothing more satisfying than building 
a new buggy and watching it fly down 
the hills. “I get really excited when a 
driver gets out of a buggy and says ‘Wow, 
that was fast,’ ” said Simmons. “It makes 
me feel like I did my job.”
For Simmons, buggy is also a family 
tradition. His father, Jay Simmons, a 
1973 engineering alumnus, was the win­
ning driver for PiKA in 1971. He helped 
Rick get hooked on buggy by bringing 
him to the races each year. “I’ve seen the 
races almost every year since I can re­
member,” said Rick. Countless other 
buggy alumni also return to campus for 
the races and other Carnival events, 
making Spring Carnival a rival to Home­
coming in popularity.
Buggies have evolved a lot since the 
race began. The original buggies had 
four wheels, similar to those used by 
soap box derby cars. Then someone fig­
ured out that they could lower rolling 
resistance and roll faster if there were 
only three wheels. One team carried 
that idea one step further with two- 
wheel, bicycle-like buggies. However, 
these buggies were dangerously un­
stable, so the rules were changed to 
allow only buggies that had at least 
three wheels.
Other major advances include the dis­
covery of stronger and lighter shell ma­
terials, and enclosing wheels within the 
shell to reduce drag. Chemically treat­
ing rubber wheels is also a big part of 
race day preparations for some teams.
Many people ask what kinds of mate­
rials and wheels are used to build a 
buggy. Unfortunately, that is a secret 
held only by the few mechanics who 
build and maintain the buggies.
All of this building and practicing 
finally builds up to the preliminary 
races this Friday morning. Men and 
women will race up the hills hoping to 
be one of the few teams to qualify for a 
second day of racing and a shot at be­
coming a champion.

Club plants seeds of environmental awareness
By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
; Environmental responsi­
bility, protection, and con­
servation. These are just 
some of the reasons that 
April 22 was first pro­
claimed Earth Day in 1970 
and since then has contin­
ued to be recognized world­
wide. In honor of this event,
Earth, CMU’s environmen- 
;tal club, has planned sev­
eral events focusing on 
¡cleaning up our surround- 
; ings and educatingthe cam- 
;pus community on various 
;environmental issues. 
‘Rather than merely recog- 
inizing the importance of 
these issues on one day, the 
club has designated April 
as “Earth Month,” sponsor­
ing activities throughout 
the entire month.
On Saturday, six students 
! helped with gardening and plant­
ing at the Frick Environmental 
¡Center, where there are many 
¡gardens with plant species na-

small tour of the building and 
informed them of upcoming 
projects and events. Then the stu­
dents were given gardening 
gloves and some heavy-duty forks 
tive to this region. The director of to weed the garden beds for dock, 
the Center gave, the students a burdock, and bull thistle weeds.
“My dad loves gardening, and 
I thought that it would be nice to 
help out the community by doing 
some gardening in the park,” said 
Helen Huang, a junior computer 
science major and one of the par­
ticipants. “These events help re­
mind the campus commu­
nity that there is more to 
life than just classes, 
labs, and projects. Help­
ing out around the com­
munity will have a long- 
lasting impact.”
Elin Warn, a senior pi­
ano and environmental sci­
ence major, is one of the 
students who has helped 
make Earth more active 
and more prominent on 
campus thisyear. “We were 
originally going to have an 
Earth Day Fair, [but] we 
decided that having sev­
eral smaller events would 
reach a larger group of stu­
dents, and they could 
choose what they wanted 
to attend,” said Warn.
Last weekend, the club 
sponsored an event for 
students to help clean up 
Schenley Park by picking 
up litter and recyclables. Despite 
the windy weather, the students 
walked along some of the trails 
and creeks in the park and were 
able to collect three trash bags of 
garbage and five bags of recy­
cling, according to Warn. She
added that the students found 
many broken bottles and shat­
tered glass around the trees. “I 
know that people will haphaz­
ardly drop things, but broken 
glass shows that people are pur­
posely polluting the environ­
ment,” she said.
The club is also planning to be 
a prominent part of this year’s 
Spring Carnival. They will be 
sponsoring a raffle for t-shirts 
and mugs at Carnival, with the 
cost of a raffle ticket being an 
empty plastic bottle or can. They 
will also be selling sturdy canvas 
grocery bags at Carnival for five 
dollars. “We would like to make 
recycling a norm during Carni­
val,” said Warn.
Besides cleaning up the sur­
rounding areas in honor of Earth 
Month, Earth is working with 
the Carnegie Mellon Environ­
mental Institute in educatingthe 
campus on various environmen­
tal issues. Graduate students 
from the Civil and Environmen­
tal Engineering Department and 
the Engineering and Public 
Policy Department will be pre­
senting their research this 
Wednesday, April 15. The audi­
ence can listen to the graduate 
student project presentations on 
topics such as green design of 
automobiles and air pollution ef­
fects on buildings.
On Earth Day, CMU President 
Jared Cohon will be presenting a 
motivational and environmentally 
related lecture entitled “Achiev­
ing Sustainability” for the cam­
pus community. According to 
Warn, Earth will also be planting 
a tree that day between the Uni­
versity Center and the CFA build­
ing, since many of the trees and 
plants have been eliminated with 
all the construction.
The club plans on continuing 
their efforts throughout the year to 
make the campus community more 
environmentally responsible, not 
just throughout Earth Month. Ac­
cording to Warn, they have been 
working on increasing student par­
ticipation in recycling by deciding 
where more containers are needed 
and labeling the containers in the 
most effective way.
“I have always been environ­
mentally motivated,”.said Warn. 
“The way things are going in the 
world today are not the way they 
should be.”

More like CDS: Coming Down Slowly.
Sweepstakes 1998 has finally arrived; 
unfortunately, El Nino came with it. On 
the days that rolls were actually held, the 
Sweepstakes committee organized things 
competently, but not always efficiently. 
Organizations themselves have not been 
up to par this year, flaggers let many a car 
Ion the course, sweepers disappeared at 
15:30 in the morning, and even the radio
club opened the roads with buggies still on 
the course. All this adds up to a lost 
number of rolls for every organization.
Now, on to the important stuff: My 
predictions for the 1998 races. This year, 
no big surprises: People will see a repeat 
of last year’s top three teams. Spirit will 
continue to show its dominance in the 
sweepstakes realm. Between their 
above-average buggies and their excel­
lent pushers, it will be difficult for any­
one to catch them.
Nipping at Spirit’s heels will be Beta. 
Even though they have not been out 
consistently, they are still a strong threat 
due to their athleticism.
In third place, PiKA sits as the quiet 
underdog, which is a role they will have 
to become accustomed to in the coming 
years. Even with their impressive bug­
gies, their pushers still lack a winning 
combination.
Phi Kap looks strong this year in the 
push department; however, to win they 
also need to get their buggies through 
the chute. At the other end of the spec­
trum is Sigma Nu. Although they main­
tain some of the best buggies in the 
competition, that’s only half the battle. 
They sure could use some outside help 
for the other half — oh, wait, they did 
that last year. If SDC can do well on 
Hills 1 and 2 and make it through the 
chute, they should be good for a sixth- 
place finish.
Rounding out the top 10 will be Spirit
B, Pioneers A, KDR A, and PiKA B. 
Spirit B is carried by the same win­
ning tradition as their A team. Pio­
neers, with their work ethic, should 
edge out KDR, who has been having 
difficulty showing up . And closing the 
top 10 will be PiKA B who should be 
good for a second-day appearance.
As for the rest of the organizations, 
Sig Tau finally found someone to fit in 
Folgers, but the design did not turn 
out quite as successfully as planned. 
Fringe’s design, on the other hand, 
seems to be getting more and more 
phallic with the years and less helpful 
in getting windows. But hey, at least 
they are building something, which is 
more than most organizations can say. 
How about you, DTD — thought you 
were building two new ones this year? 
Also, what about Kappa Sigma, AEPi, 
and DU? Do you guys really not have 
what it takes to even show, up?
As for the return players, CIA and 
SAE, good to see you back; unfortu­
nately, you have to crawl before you 
can walk again.
That just about does it for 
Compubookie’s 1998 race day predic­
tions. I hope to see everyone out there 
having fun, so that all the other orga­
nizations that missed out this year 
will want to jump back into the action 
next year.
Midway transforms myths into realities
MIDWAY, from page LI
year senior in civil and environmental 
engineering. “It’s relatively small and 
inexpensive, but helps us to use water as 
an element to our design.”
Other booth themes include Alpha Ep­
silon Pi’s Area 51 (that mysterious place 
where the government hides all of our 
alien attackers), the Lost City of Atlantis 
by SigmaPhi Epsilon, the Legend of Sleepy 
Hollow by Fringe, and the Taiwanese Stu­
dent Association’s tribute to Elvis. The 
Hockey Club is using the Hanson brothers 
(the hockey legends, not the teenybopper 
pop group) as their theme.
New on the Midway this year is the 
Blitz Booth, a non-competitive booth 
category that features structures half 
the size of the regular booths. In this 
category, the focus is on the game, 
rather than the structure. The idea 
began when Margaret Wang and other 
members of the Spring Carnival Com­
mittee saw a decrease in the number of 
booths on the Midway this year. “We 
saw openings [on Midway] and wanted 
to see how we could fill them,” said 
Wang, a junior electrical and computer 
engineering major and Midway Chair 
for this year’s Carnival Committee. 
“The Blitz Booth is for organizations
who don’t have the money or man­
power to do booth.... It’s an opportu­
nity for organizations to get their feet 
wet [in the Midway experience].”
The Kiltie Band’s Blitz Booth theme 
will be the marching band-appropriate 
Pied Piper. “It’s the Kiltie Band’s first 
year to be represented on the Midway, 
and we’re really excited to be participat­
ing,” said Susan Cribbs, a sophomore 
Englishmajor and theband’sbooth chair. 
“Our booth willhopefully be plaid.” Other 
organizations participating the new cat-. 
egory are Mayur, Mudge 3B, and Friends 
of the Board, a skateboarding club.
Also new this year is the focus on 
family-oriented activities on Saturday 
afternoon. “We’re having a juggler, a 
clown.... The entertainment is more for 
kids than [CMU] students because the 
Midway is typically pretty dead Satur­
day afternoon,” said Wang. This is usu­
ally because of concerts and other events 
happening elsewhere on campus.
Several of the booth chairs said that as 
opening day draws nearer, the people 
involved in Midway have become increas­
ingly optimistic of a successful event.
“I’ve been trying to conserve my en­
ergy [for Carnival],” said Wang. “It 
should be a lot of fun.”

on’t even ask, your interpretation is as 
good as mine. Is it random artwork, or 
does it have a meaning? Perhaps the artist 
was trying to express the futility of modern 
life. It could be an abstract interpretation of 
religion. Maybe it’s an attack on the com­
mercialization of society.
My guess is that it’s an old guy with i press

This year two members of the CMU
Juggling Club, Ken Payson, a fifth O
year senior, and sophomore Matt
McGuire, both mechanical engineer- frjf sK ?
ing majors, will roam the Midway
performing their juggling act 7
for students and others at- ^

According to Carnival W TK_ Jlf
Chair Jenna Yerger, the j
jugglers are part of the ^

“We’re attempting to bring vk

There is something very idyllic and 
fantastic about the Middle Ages. It was 
a time when knights fought for their 
honor, traveling minstrels performed 
for their suppers, sorcerers cast magi­
cal spells, and jesters entertained. This 
year the Carnival Committee has 
brought together a wonderful group of 
sword fighters, actors, jugglers, come­
dians, and magicians to recreate these 
mythical and legendary days of old dur­
ing this year’s events.
The sword fighting comes courtesy of 
Carnegie Mellon’s own Society for Cre­
ative Anachronism (SCA). The fighters 
will be recreating the skill and dedica­
tion of the Knights of the Round Table 
by demonstrating heavy weapon com­
bat in full armor. They will also be doing 
m'edieval dances and singing songs. In 
addition, there will be a display of art­
work done by SCA members, all of which 
will be in the styles of the Middle Ages.
Also taking place during Carnival is 
the Scotch ‘n’ Soda Production of 
Assassins Assassins is a musical by 
Stephen Sondheim that follows the cir­
cumstances of some of the more famous 
•presidential assassinators, including 
John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey 
Oswald. (Apparently Sondheim never 
watched The X-Files.)
If assassinations and music sound 
like an odd combination, that’s prob­
ably because it is. Freshman Kieran 
Smiley, an actor in the show, said that 
although the show should appeal to 
most students, it is a little quirky. “It’s 
not on the norm. [Students should] be

Lewit said he worked at at­
taching historical characters to 
modern issues, so that the play 
relates to college students in 
America as much as to anyone.
“It’s fun because it’s written 
for a far different audience. It’s 
really for the baby-boomers, our 
parents,” said Kim Sims, a his­
tory major who plays the Bal- 
ladeer in the show. “It’s excit­
ing to perform it for the college 
campus.”
Scotch ‘n’ Soda’s 50-member 
cast and crew have been work­
ing on the show for the past 
five weeks. They will perform 
the show four times for Carni­
val weekend: on Thursday, 
Friday, and Saturday night 
and Saturday afternoon in 
Rangos Hall in the University 
Center. The students have 
spent many hours working on 
the show. “It was challenging 
bringing a lot of different ele­
ments together with a large set 
and complex music. And an or­
chestra,” said Lewit. Lewit said 
that he is glad that the show 
united so many different people 
with different perspectives on 
the show.

most interesting bands out there 
today, possibly ever.
If you’ve never heard of the Jon 
Spencer Blues Explosion, allow 
me to attempt to explain them. 
They’re not exactly blues, as the 
name may suggest. They are all 
about pushing boundaries; and 
they manage to stretch the blues 
until it sounds like the unholy 
spawn of Robert Johnson and 
Trent Reznor, conceived in the 
back alleys of Manhattan, birthed 
in James Brown’s living room.
Spencer isn’t the standard blues 
type. He’s from an academic, 
white, upscale household, with a 
background in punk. From 1985 
to 1990, Spencer played guitar in 
a band called Pussy Galore, which 
was lumped into the indie 
“pigfucker” movement by Spin 
magazine, a genre characterized 
by loud noisej experimental mu­
sical mayhem, and obscenity. •
So how does one go from punk 
to funk you ask. Well, Spencer 
has taken the band from what 
might have been a dual guitar, 
drums, hold the bass guitar, 
grungy wannabe to a mix-and- 
match blues-centric musical pot- 
luck mega-meal. Numerous col­
laborators account for the Blues 
Explosion’s ever-mutating sound. 
Their biggest collaborative effort 
has been with North Mississippi 
bluesman R. L. Burnside, with 
whom they have released a col­
laborative album, A Ass Pocket of 
Whiskey. Additionally, the two 
toured the club scene together, 
with Burnside the traditional 
blues opening act, Spencer and 
Co. as the blues’s bastard off­
spring headlining.
The collaboration doesn’t stop 
there. On their latest album, Now 
I Got Worry, they put Rufus Tho­
mas, the funkiest man alive, at
the front of the trio and let him do 
his thing. Thomas is old school 
dance and rock, having recorded 
hits like “Bear Cat,” “Funky 
Chicken,” and “The Breakdown.,| 
And for a little something extra; 
they throw in Money Mark; 
keyboardist extraordinaire with 
the Beastie Boys.
Since these guys are coming for 
Carnival, you’re probably won­
dering how their live shows are. 
Rumor is, they’re amazing. Speni 
cer has the charisma of ten Vegas 
lounge singers and the energy of 
a neutron bomb. Therefore, Blues 
Explosion. Blues Explosion 
shows, like the albums, are very 
improvisational, fun, and ines­
capably funky.
There is no doubt that th£ 
Blues Explosion will be a good 
time for all. Any band that lets

St»«*«
Concert shines spotlight on label’s featured artists
By DAVE ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
A drum big enough to live in, a balcony 
climb, enough bass to dissolve molecu­
lar bonds: It was all at Metropol last 
Wednesday at the Pittsburgh stop of the 
Invisible tour, “Lowest of the Low.” 
Bands from the Invisible record label 
amused for over three and a half hours, 
and the evening culminated in a perfor­
mance by Pigface. Although the first 
bands dealt with electronic types of 
mtisic, the night ended with more tradi­
tional and more peopled acts. For many 
the favorite was Pigface, but I enjoyed a 
couple of the supporting musicians (as 
many were one or two people) signifi­
cantly more.
Preceding the live music and during 
set changes, a video screen behind the 
stage showed everything from videos of 
Invisible bands to part of Hitchcock’s 
The 39 Steps, to geometrical patterns 
and neon-edged karate fighters. Unfor­
tunately, during the first acts, the pro­
jection hit some of the instruments on 
stage, and so it was a bit difficult to see 
what was going on.
Bagman opened the evening and 
piayed a 20-minute set. His outpouring 
of? drum and bass was accompanied by 
tlie rap/reggae-tinged vocals and danc­
ing of Thiggahmahjiggee. Two of the 
highlights of the night had to be his 
climb onto the balcony and I-beams of 
Metropol and his headstand on the 
speaker stack. Although the perfor­
mance was too short, I did pick out 
“Bosh,” the only Bagman song I know. 
In addition, the general sonic atmo­
sphere of the night was set with ex­
tremely loud bass.
’The none-too-active crowd only be­
came more sedate with Dead Voices 
on Air’s segment. Sole member Mark 
Spybey started by dedicating the night 
to Dave Wright of Not Breathing; the 
band had to cancel its appearance due 
to his spinal meningitis.
Spybey then bounced around and 
twiddled knobs for the next 35 min­
utes, producing music that seesawed 
fifam purely ambient to big drums and 
b&ck to a drone.
As if to prove that there were deeper 
to be explored, Scorn’s 
was grounded in the meanest, nasti­
est rumblings I have ever experienced. 
On top of Mick Harris’ dub-styled beats 
were droning ambient textures. Despite 
all the bass, the energy didn’t seem to be 
there; I thought he should have come on 
a bit earlier in the lineup.
FM Einheit and his band exceeded 
my nonexistent expectations. The first 
to play real instruments, their songs 
went from dance tunes with coil springs 
to trippy numbers.
My favorite was anchored in a de­
mented cabaret horn section. Vocal­
ist Gry sounded a bit like Beth Gib­
bons of Portishead when she wasn’t 
emitting dolphin squeals or creating 
interesting sounds from a mouthful 
of water. All in all, their 30 minutes 
on stage were the most interesting of 
the night.
Finally it was time for Pigface. After 
the oddly non-bagpipe “Radio Bagpipe” 
was performed in front of the screen, it 
came down, and they moved into the 
first real song. Through the next hour 
and a half, the seven to nine musicians 
onstage went through a number of the 
bigger hits such as “Suck,” “Ten Ground 
and Down,” “Asphole,” and “Nutopia.” 
There always seemed to be at least two 
people singing at once, which raised 
the energy level but also muddied the 
sound a bit.
Prominent guitar and strong beats 
from the two drummers stood in stark 
contrast with the electronic, stripped- 
down loops of their latest album as well 
as with the earlier groups.
For whatever reason, I didn’t really 
connect with the band, which clearly 
placed me in the minority. The crowd 
was most active during this part of the 
evening, stage diving and moshing. I 
found the end to be a bit more exciting — 
after the “we’re done; good night” inter­
mission came the sitar-tinged “Kiss King 
(high high high).”
Later, Pittsburgh’s Mindless Faith 
came on stage during “Hips, Tits, Lips, 
Power!” to bang an oil drum and sing. 
As a final local note, Peter Guellard, 
formerly of Mace, appeared on stage to 
sing as well.
It seemed there was something for 
everyone with electronic and experimen­
tal music as well as the more conven­
tional. With so many bands playing for 
so long, how could one go wrong?
Indie CD compilation expands electronic genre
By DAVE ELMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
It’s fitting that “independence and 
strength through diversification” can 
be found in the logo of Invisible 
Records. The label’s latest compila­
tion, Drug Test Three, reflects the di­
versity of Invisible’s stable which is 
proudly independent. However, in­
scribing “to further underline the sub­
lime” in the CD booklet is pompous 
and a bit, well, misleading.
/^I Who: Various Artists LJgj What: Drug Test ThreeCompany: Invisible Records
Martin Atkins, ex-drummer of Public 
Image Ltd. and Killing Joke among 
others, founded Invisible to release his 
next project, a band named Pigface. 
Having now released seven full-length 
albums, Pigface is somewhat unique in 
having a revolving list of members. 
Among these have been Trent Reznor of 
Nine Inch Nails, Ogre of Skinny Puppy,
and En Esch of KMFDM. The core, 
however, is and always will be Atkins.
After working with many labels, 
Atkins felt that the only way to stay in 
the music industry was to work on his 
own. Once he’d gone that far, it was 
only natural to extend the same ser­
vice and accompanying mentality to 
others needing a clear path to a mar­
ket free from the usual politics. Years 
and many members of Pigface later, 
Invisible’s philosophy is still the same 
as the Drug Test compilations show.
This mentality of freedom should 
also be evident on Invisible’s tour, 
entitled “The Lowest of the Low.”
Once we understand the philosophy 
and history behind it all, we can finally 
look at the music intelligently. The 
compilation starts off with Bagman’s 
“Bosh,” a drum ’n’ bass track. Although 
the break is similar to many others, the 
song distances itself from much of the 
genre in the lush melody and vocal 
samples that are layered on top.
Another track by Brits out of America
comes from an entirely different direc­
tion. The emphasis here is on bass, with 
three bassists credited in the insert. Un­
like “Bosh,” the drums are live, and the 
result is much more pop-oriented, com­
plete with droning female vocals.
Following this are three songs that all 
fight for the title of “least likely to be 
played on commercial radio in the foresee­
able future.” Songs by Dead Voices on Air 
vs. Not Breathing, FM Einheit, and Lab ~ 
Report all run the gamut of sounds, from-,- 
electronic squiggles, and rumbling bass, f-
One the more accessible tracks are^ 
from Pigface and Psychic TV. The roughs 
vocals of Marc Heal are offset by those of* 
Dirk Flannigan, and the stripped-down 
bass loop pushes the number onto the 
dance floor.
While generally a good compilation 
showing off the diversity of the label, 
Drug Test Three does contain a few 
misses like most other releases of its 
kind. If you’re interested in expanding 
your electronic music tastes, it’s a good 
place to start.

-L12The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 13 April 1998Producers capitalize on angel craze in recent film
; By SUSAN CALDWELL
¡. Tartan Staffwriter
City of Angels, starring Nicholas Cage 
' and Meg Ryan, is a romantic comedy 
! made just like the Victoria’s Secret An- 
\gels underwear: marketed for its cute- 
*• ness, but really not that cute at all. The 
: producers attempted a bittersweet, 
; heartwarming love story of a celestial 
[• being who falls in love with a temporal 
: one. They succeeded, however, in pro­
ducing a fantasy of illogical irony, a 
-¿pretentious lust story intended to capi- 
k itialize on the whole angel craze thing.
Nicholas Cage plays the angel Seth,
- . who, along with the other angels, has 
¿. been spending his eternity traveling at 
; ;£he speed of thought between hospitals, 
^libraries, and the beach. The moment he 
! .sees Dr. Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan) in a 
hospital, he falls hopelessly in love with 
her. Maggie, a heart surgeon, has the
house on the hill overlooking the city 
and a desire for something deeper be­
yond her too-sterile world, where crying 
has more to do with tear ducts than 
intense emotions. Nicholas Cage seems 
to grapple with his portrayal of Seth, the 
rebel angel in black — there are teary 
eyes, an unrealistic intensity and a des­
perate inquisitiveness of Maggie’s secu­
lar world. Meg Ryan’s character adds 
dimension to the plot because she repre­
sents us, with the added dilemma of 
falling in love with the angel.
The words angel, romance, and com­
edy struggle to intertwine in this movie. 
The overall lack of cohesion takes the 
viewer on a poorly-constructed emotional 
roller coaster ride. Eventually I just fell 
off — I found few things angelic, roman­
tic, or comedic about City of Angels. 
Seth’s interest in Maggie and the carnal 
world seem hardly angelic. As far as 
romance is concerned, the idea of two
logical adults staring each other in the 
face breathlessly confessing undying love 
to one another after a day of aquaintance 
seems a little unrealistic, even if one of 
them is an angel.
In the comedy department, the angel 
oneliners only add to the superficiality 
of the film. Overall, this movie lacks 
depth, a cohesive structure, and a solid 
premise. It fails in whatever category 
they put it under, and the overly sappy 
sentimental angel songs that played at 
the right moments did not help at all.
The best and perhaps only good thing 
about this movie is its testament to the 
bittersweetness of life. This movie tries 
to make us believe that life is more sweet 
than bitter and a mere moment of love is 
better than an eternity without it. How­
ever, I’m not convinced, especially after 
spending two hours of my time rolling 
my eyes towards the ceiling and shaking 
my head.

Drama students show work
By HEATHER DENYER
Tartan Staffwriter
, Anyone who happens to wan- 
. der into the Hewlett Gallery in 
. the CFA might notice a diverse 
exhibition. Yes, it’s art, but it’s 
.not your typical painting or photo 
..exhibit: It’s theater. The drama 
„^design exhibit titled Form and 
„.-Function is on display in the show­
room until April 22. Every year 
jor the past several years, the 
theater design classes and gradu­
ate students have exhibited work 
so all can see what really goes on 
Dehind the scenes.
This exhibit, housed in two rooms, 
is a showcase of the work of the 
students — impressive and com­
plex artwork that is very seldom 
displayed. The front room of the 
gallery displays work created and 
constructed for one of the Kresge 
productions this year. The back 
room displays work from the classes. 
Within the drama department, 
there is a wide range of artistic 
work studied separately from act­
ing and directing. Students major­
ing in one of the technical aspects of
theatre start off exploring all of the 
various fields of design. The exposi­
tion includes self-portraits, and 
even 3-D and bas relief projects 
from the freshman students.
“[The first year] focuses on look- 
ingfor personal ways to solve prob­
lems. It’s introspective work,” said 
Anne Mundell, instructor of draw­
ing, drafting, and design in the 
School of Drama. The back room 
also displays the advanced “de­
sign for stage” projects, for which 
students develop sketches.
Other members of the College of 
Fine Aits will be interested in the 
shared aspects of the drama stu­
dents’ work. One of the steps in 
designing a set is to draw a ground 
plan, which resembles the blue­
prints of an architect.The students 
demonstrate their creativity in 
complete set paintings and color­
ful'watercolor sketches of costumes.
The magic of the inventive work 
takes form in this exhibit with man­
nequins modeling the costumes that 
you might have scene this year in 
one of the school’s main-stage pro­
ductions: The Learned Ladies, Ber­
lin to Broadway, or Female Trans­
port. The costumes for these plays 
present masterpieces from 16th 
century French bourgeoisie to 18th 
century prisoners.
Add to the wardrobe watercolor 
sketches for Titania’s fairy queen 
costume in Midsummer Night’s 
Dream and robust women’s robes 
from Sweeney Todd, and you begin 
to realize the array of diverse artis­
tic talents thriving among the stu­
dents and instructors here. You 
can even flip through notes and' 
pictures from the historical re­
search for these projects or the 
lighting design for one ofthe shows.
After wandering through the 
exhibit, you will recognize the 
impressive amount of work that 
goes into the shows. If you have 
enjoyed any of the productions of 
the School of Drama or wondered 
about drama design, then this 
exhibit will surely impress you. 
“[We want] people to sense the joy 
and love that goes into what we 
do,” said Mundell of the idea be­
hind this display, “The exhibit 
shows the process and the care, 
the artistry and craft that goes 
into what’s on stage.”
Previews highlight mythical 
moments in Carnival events
EVENTS, from page L9
act on his bizarre upbringing. 
Then comedian/ventriloquist 
Lynn Trefzger will perform 
for audiences on the 
Main Stage.
Comedian Tammy
Pescatelli will be performing 
on Sunday evening. No 
stranger to college campuses, 
Pescatelli tailors her act to 
appeal to college students.
According to Yerger, she is the 
opening act for perhaps the big­
gest name expected to be per­
forming at Carnival, Darryl 
Hammond, whose dead-on imper­
sonation of Bill Clinton on Satur­
day Night Live has made him a 
household name.
Hammond’s name recognition 
was a large part of what made 
him desirable, said Chirag Shah, 
the Student Dormitory Council
campus programming chair.
“We wanted a big name,” said 
Shah, a sophomore electrical and 
chemical engineering major. “We 
wanted to show people that they 
were getting their money’s worth.”
With dueling swordsmen, mu­
sicals, traveling jugglers, magi­
cians, and comedians evoking a 
mythical and medieval spirit, 
this year’s Carnival is sure to'be 
legendary.
Play showcases American killers
PLAY, from page L9
are popular for their meaning in 
the context of a play. “There is 
almost no dance. The show is a 
musical life-line. All ofthe num­
bers carry the plot,” said Dairen 
Mauro, a senior computer sci­
ence major who is the musical 
director of the show and presi­
dent of the Scotch ‘n’ Soda Club.
The music itself is as challeng­
ing as the characters are. With a 
small orchestra of students, the 
musical numbers are showy but 
still crucial to the evolvement of 
the characters. “[The songs are] 
drawn from everything from Sousa 
Marches to Steven Foster-esque
folk ballads and pop music — even 
pop love songs,” says Mauro.
The show runs for about an 
hour and a half and promises to 
be an intellectual piece enter­
taining for the campus commu­
nity, said Lewit. Certainly, for 
its uniqueness, Assassins is a 
show not to miss.

Band’s noise teaches new thinking
By STEPHEN BIDWA
Tartan Staffwriter
First of all, let me get a hallelu­
jah from the congregation for re­
viewing yet another album pro­
duced by a true independent la­
bel, not one that has been en­
gulfed in the ever-shrinking 
record label universe by the giant 
companies like Sony and Poly­
gram. Tumbuckle Records, to the 
best of my knowledge, is still the 
small fish doing its own thing out 
there in the wide ocean, releas­
ing this album, A Place Called El 
Shaddai’s, from the band Oneida.
What: A Place Called El 
Shaddai’s 
Company: Turnbuckle
This disc is not an easy first 
listen. If you’ve never bothered to 
educate your musical ear to 
freestyle jazz or certain industrial 
or alternative groups like Pigface, 
Sonic Youth, or Primus, it may 
never be an easy listen. To those 
people, words like cacophony are 
tres common when describing the 
sounds assaulting their auditory 
systems. Dismiss these descrip­
tions and force yourself to relearn 
how it is you go about listening to 
music. You will get something spe­
cial out of it.
Yeah, there are two tracks on 
this album that even an open-
minded, experienced 
alterna-listener may never 
learn to enjoy. But if you 
consciously grit your teeth 
and suffer through the en­
tire album (oh, it’ll hurt the 
first few times you try to do 
this), you will leave the ex­
perience with a much bet­
ter understanding of just 
how music is put together 
and how altering sounds 
from the usual pop 
soundtrack into totally for­
eign noises can be a cre­
ative thing. The members 
of Oneida are all quality mu­
sicians, so it’s not just “wast­
ing time” on some lousy ga­
rage band that quite simply 
sucks and is truly produc­
ing inharmonious junk.
A Place Called El 
Shaddai’s is an album of 
flavors. Laying down the higher 
register of many of the songs is 
whiny or distorted guitar. Fre­
quently, there is a low humming 
that occasionally switches notes 
in the background, supportingthe 
drumming and cymbal work 
when it’s present. Also tossed into 
the recipe are bagpipes, tenor 
saxophone, and (this is just a 
guess) someone shaking broken 
glass bottles around in a tray. 
Oneida seems all about search. 
This album is searching for new 
sound combinations, new instru­
mental teams that haven’t been
courtesy Tumbuckle Records
Oneida’s newest album is an exploration into new realms of auditory 
experience. Recommended listening: Ray Lynch and Sonic Youth.
used before. It’s alternative mu­
sic R & D, and it’s the same spirit 
of innovation that garnered bands 
like Sonic Youth and Ray Lynch 
so much respect from other musi­
cians and listeners alike for their 
work in innovative sounds and 
composition.
As far as feels go, APlace Called 
El Shaddai’s is mostly a mellow, 
dim-lights kind of album. Sev­
eral tracks have the soul of a jam 
session in a hip hangout spot, but 
without solo performances. The 
pieces strive for coherence, with 
all of the sounds in each track
forming a bigger, better whole, 
whether it’s humming bass,- ’or 
ride cymbals, or mistuned guitar 
work. Frankly, a lot of the time I 
have no idea what instrument-or 
digital equipment it is that they^re 
using to create their sounds. 
That’s exciting. Expand your au­
ditory experience beyond the com­
fortable guitar or drum machine 
arrangements you’re used to. 
Maybe after listening to stranger 
music for a while, whether or not 
you enjoy it, you will return'to 
your old favorites and find y\)u 
hear them in an all-new way! -

A,
In the end we decided one thing. 1923 is just a bunch 
of numbers. Of course it’s a year. It has significance 
but, damned if we could find it. We thought hard 
about the sound of 1923, the way it rolled of our 
tongues, the way it resonated in the speech centers of 
our brain. Other words started to appear: roaring twen- I 
ties, numbers, modern things, past and present, time period. 
In the end, we created a magazine that embodied the 
connotations of these words.
The fiction picccs have elements of random chance and danger in their sto­
ries and in the design. The wandering, layout of Strangers, augmented with some ver­
nacular details, reflects the emptiness of the characters in the story. In Masquerade, 
Beldncr’s plastic atmosphere takes form in the heavily techno-influenced layout. Lee- 
Anne draws from the internal struggles of the characters in American Dreams, produc- I 
ing a quietly tense layout filled with objects that reflect value.
James Kuo’s poetry layouts evoked the seedy side of nostalgia, using a series 
of deconstructed old-style images. Platts Stephen Crane and Wilson’s The Lost Arts of 
Manliness don’t necessarily put a positive spin on the past, but they make it more 
interesting to look at.
This issue of Dossier was like an experiment with time tavel. We brought 
back some interetsing artifacts, but in trying to tackle the issue of then and now, we 
created some new.
HORIZON LINE .
6ROUND LINE

---------------------------------------------------

Easing myself over the automatic shift, I flop into the passenger seat. Sprii 
through the vinyl cover and into my legs. The whole car reeks of cigarette si 
guess pushing hadn't been so bad after all. Herb is able to start the car on th< 
try, and, even though I am practically frozen, I roll down the window a little. Herb 
notices that I keep my mouth glued to the crack of rushing air, but says nothing. I tell 
him to head north, and we ride for awhile in silence.
"Do you believe in God?" Herb asks suddenly.
"No," I respond, giving him a sidelong glance. "Why do you ask?"
"Just curious."
I turn to face him, leaving the fresh, frigid air behind. His eyes remain fixed on 
the road. 'You do."
"Yes, I do." Herb glances over at me. "What made you so sure?"
"Why else would you have asked?"
Herb sits silently until I turn back to the window, then asks, "Which way?"
"Keep straight on this for a few more blocks. I'll let you know when to turn." I 
hesitate, then add, "So, why do you?"
For a moment I think he has not 
heard me, but I soon realize that he is 
deep in thought. I don't think anyone 
ever asked him that before. Finally,
Herb answers by asking "Why believe 
in anything?" I laugh, and Herb frowns 
instantly. "Are you trying to insult me?"
"No. Not at all," I say, smiling.
"That just happens to be exacdy the 
same answer I give when people ask me 
why I don't."
"Oh. I see." Herb ponders this, 
then chuckles to himself. "That is 
funny."
"Turn here," I say.
Herb pulls the car over to the curb in 
front of my three-story apartment
building. After he gets out, I slide back over the gear shift and stand up next to him, 
brushing the debris off my suit pants. I look up at my building, then over to Herb. 
What do I say now? I will never see this man again, and, unexpectedly, I am disap­
pointed. I look into his eyes and say, "Thank you very much, Herb." I mean it.
"Thank you, PauL"
We shake hands.

---------------------------------------------------

and I am clearly the loser.
Reluctantly, I bend my knees and grasp the frame exposed by the open door. It's 
been a long time since I've assumed this position. When I was a teenager, I owned a 
Volkswagen beetle that I had to push-start half the time. Of course, that car could 
have fit in the back seat of this one with enough room for me to sit comfortably 
beside it. I lean a shoulder into the metal and push as hard as I can.
After several minutes of slipping around in the slush, 
the big American boat of a car begins to crawl forward. Herb informs me that the 
nearest gas station is only two blocks away, which he located shordy before finding 
me. Unfortunately, because of a slight incline, we have to take a longer, indirect route. 
I am too busy swearing to respond. Herb doesn't seem to mind, though.
Forty minutes later, we roll slowly into the pool of yellow, incandescent light 
flooding the concrete oasis of the gas station. A sleepy clerk watches us disinterested­
ly from behind bullet-proof glass, inside the metal cocoon attached to the closed mini­
mart. Herb stops die car next to the closest pump, and I fall to my knees, panting. 
Stepping out past me, he picks up the nozzle for the highest octane gasoline and 
moves toward the tank.
"Whoa!" I blurt out, shaking my 
head. "Cheap stuff]"
"Not in this car, my friend," Herb 
responds amiably. "If I put anything 
besides premium gas in this bad boy, the 
engine'll start knocking and pinging like 
crazy."
"Beggars can't be choosers," I say, 
struggling to my feet, much to the cha­
grin of my wobbly knees.
"That is a very selfish attitude, 
Mister...say, what is your name, any­
way?"
"What do you care? I already 
pushed your car for you."
"O.K. fine, be anti-social. But may 
I please use premium gas so that I don't 
destroy my car?"
It looks pretty destroyed already to 
me, but he did that thing with his voice 
again and I soften right up. I can't 
believe I'm this easily manipulated. I 
had thought it was only Jenny I couldn't 
say no to, but I guess I'm a sucker for 
just about anybody. If she were here 
right now she would call me cheap, and 
she would be right. I'm ready for risk- 
taking, but I'm not willing to give up 
being cheap yet. "All right, Herb. But 
only half a tank."
Herb nods and sticks the nozzle 
direcdy into the side of the car, as the 
gas cap appears to be missing. I watch
him filling the tank, then mumble, "By 
the way, the name's Danvers."
"Glad to know you, Mr. Danvers."
"You know, Herb, you reaUy ought 
to keep a gas can in 
your trunk. Even if it was empty, you 
could have walked here, filled it,, and 
walked back in half the time it took us 
to push the whole car here."
"True," Herb thinks aloud. "But 
then I wouldn't have met you, would I?"
"There might'not have been any­
one there to help you."
"But you were," Herb says. "You 
see, destiny brings
people together at times when it seems 
least intentional."
"Oh, come on," I reply. "You don't 
actually believe in fate, do you?"
Herb replaces the nozzle on the 
pump. "I think I just 
answered that, Mr. Danvers."
"Call me Paul," I say abrupdy, sur­
prising myself. I don't even let the guys 
at work call me by my first name. Why 
did I say that?
"O.K., Paul. Time to pay the 
piper." We walk toward the hermetical­
ly sealed attendant. A silver metal 
drawer shoots out at us as we approach.
The clerk's distorted voice comes 
through the window 
speaker: "Eighteen-fifty."
I turn to Herb. "Just how big is 
this gas tank?" Herb only smiles. I
drop a twenty dollar bill in the drawer, thinking how many more gallons of the cheap 
stuff we could have had for that amount. Oh, well, not my car, although it is my 
money, and cab fare would have been a lot less. But somehow I don't particularly 
mind splurging tonight. These past few days have been rough, and I sort of enjoy 
Herb's company. The drawer suddenly snaps closed, shaking me out of my reverie 
and almost taking my hand off. It reappears a moment later containing a dollar bill 
and two quarters. I retrieve these and turn to Herb as the drawer retracts loudly with­
in its protective shell. We walk slowly back toward the car.
"Any tolls on your way home?" I ask.
"No."
"Oh." I replace the money in my wallet and return the wallet to my right front 
pocket. Thieves are less likely to get at it there than in a back pocket. I discovered 
that lesson the hard way. As I walk around to the passenger side door, Herb says,
"Not getting in that way. That door hasn't worked for years."
I walk back around to the driver's side and slide in past the steering wheel.

you where you gotta go."
I eye the man suspiciously from beneath 
the rim of my
umbrella. If he had wanted to mug me, I 
would already be
unconscious on the sidewalk. So what is this 
guy's scam?
"You have a name?" I ask. That's right. 
Start asking
for details and they run for cover every time.
"Name's Herb Landon. I live in 
Wellsford. You know
where that is?" I shake my head, releasing a 
shower of droplets from the umbrella. Either 
this guy is really on the level, or he is damn 
good. He didn't even bat an eyelash. "It's 
just down the highway a stretch. Grew up 
there. Played football for Carlton High.
Got my B.A. at the Community College.
I'm a chef."
"Really?" I say with feigned interest. 
Well, that was
more information than I needed. The guy 
should just hand out
resumes. I wonder if any of that had been 
true. Maybe the name. What gets me is 
that he obviously wants money, but he won't 
come out and say it. Is he too proud, or is he 
trying to play on my emotions? I decide to 
lay things out on the table for once. "Look, 
if you need money, how come you haven't 
asked me for it?"
Herb looks genuinely surprised, and 
partially offended. "Everybody needs 
money," he says. "I need help."
The genuine emotion in his voice stardes me. "But the only way I can help you 
is by giving you money."
"You wouldn't be giving it to me," Herb assures me.
"You'd be paying me for a service rendered. I'm offering to 
drive you."
When did this turn into a business proposal? I wonder 
who I can tell this bizarre story to, assuming that I ever manage to get home. Last 
week I would have told Jenny, but now it would have to be one of the guys at the 
paper.
Jenny. For the first time in three solid days, I had actually forgotten about our 
break-up. She had said many painful things, the worst one being that I am boring to 
be around because I don't take risks and never try anything new. Maybe it's time for a 
little self-improvement, then. I don't especially want to hear that complaint ever 
again.
I throw a quick glance back to my longstanding rival, the phone booth. I could
stand here waiting for a cab all night, and the police would find my body tomorrow 
with a quarter frozen to my palm. Or, I could go with Herb right now and possibly 
live through the night. Three nights ago I would never have considered trusting a 
complete stranger, but now, well, what do I really have to lose? I mean, I don't know 
any cab drivers, but I still trust them to drive me places.
"All right, Herb, you've sold me. Lead the way." Herb crosses the street and I 
follow. Then it hits me. "Wait a minute. If you're out of gas, how can you drive to a 
gas station?"
"I can't. You're gonna push."
I knew it. I knew it was a scam. "What?! I pay, you 
push."
"Sorry, man. No one drives the vehicle but me."
"Well, I can't exacdy drive a car with no fuel, now can I? I'll just be steering."
"Same difference to me. Give it up. It's not gonna 
happen, my friend."
Ha! He thinks I'm his friend. "Look, there is no way I am going to pay you so 
that I can push..."
"Here we are," Herb interrupts.
We stand before a huge, beat-up, blue Ford sedan, manufactured over a decade 
ago. The body has severe rust damage up to the windows, and a large crack snakes 
across the windshield. There are no hubcaps and the trunk doesn't latch properly 
because the rear end was crumpled in a collision. To prevent it from flying open, 
Herb has tied the trunk latch to the bumper with some twine. The interior is littered 
with empty cigarette packs and glass bottles.
'This is your.. .car?" I ask.
'Yeah, beauty ain't it? I've had her eight years and 
she's never done me wrong."
"Until tonight, of course."
"Oh, no. It was my fault for not filling up this morning. You ready to roll?"
"Herb, I can't push this monster! It must weigh five 
thousand pounds. There's enough steel here for three cars."
"Trust me, it's much lighter than it looks." Herb unlocks the door and climbs 
into the driver's seat. I can't believe he actually keeps the doors locked. Who's going 
to steal this beast? Herb shifts the car into neutral. Apparendy our argument is over,

12I slam the receiver back into its cradle. The pay- 
phone mocks me, while freezing rain slops all over 
my black umbrella. To keep my gloveless hands in 
their pockets, I have anchored the plastic handle in 
my shirt's breast pocket. The lapels of my heavy 
black overcoat stubbornly refuse to stay tucked under 
my chin anyway. I feel like the damn Morton's salt 
girl, standing here alone like an idiot.
I pull my right hand out long enough to glance at my 
pocket watch, an action I have repeated regularly for an hour and twenty minutes now. 
In between these time-checks, I have been battling the graffiti-covered payphone 
before me. A single quarter has entered and exited this phone more times than I care 
to remember, all because the phones at the taxi company are busy.
With nothing but mindless manual dexterity to occupy me, my thoughts have 
naturally revolved around Jenny. I miss her. During the play tonight I especially felt 
her absence embodied in the empty seat beside me. I was so preoccupied by it that I 
barely paid any attention to the performance, and will therefore have to give it a good 
review.
After almost a year and a half together, this Monday she suddenly decided that 
she was unhappy with herself, which meant, of course, that she was unhappy with me. 
That was that. I have not spoken to her for three days now, and probably never will 
again. So, tonight, attending a play alone for the first time in several years, I dressed 
up slighdy more than usual, in the vain hope that I might meet someone new, some­
one who can help me to forget her.
I sincerely regret my choice of clothing now. What I 
wouldn't give to be wearing boots instead of soaked leather dress shoes, encrusted 
with a visible salt line. And why didn't I think to roll my damn shirt-sleeves back 
down before the end of the show? It had been so stifling in there that I had allowed 
myself the impropriety of cuff-rolling, and the theater had been dark enough that no 
one noticed. But when the lights had 
come back on at the end, 1 had quickly 
thrown my sports coat on without 
thinking of the weather conditions.
The phone lines must be down. I 
mean, really, how could a taxi company 
be this busy after midnight on a 
Thursday? In retrospect, I should have 
stayed in the lobby, but then 1 didn't 
exactly expect to still be trying to get a 
cab when the theater closed and locked 
its doors. Now the place is dark and the 
narrow street is deserted, except for the 
occasional car that blows past me, trying 
to splatter my expensive clothes with 
slush and road salt. Three taxis have 
been among these, at which I waved 
insanely, trying to attract their attention.
They saw me all right, but the bastards
just kept right on going. The last cabby, while flyi e; past, had actually looked me 
right in the face, pointed at me, and laughed. That was when I realized that my 
situation had officially become a serious problem.
Rapid footsteps approach from behind; I whii around, 
pulling my hands out. A tall, black man, clad in fu Jed jeans, a wool jacket, and a 
soiled baseball cap, motions with an open palm for me to relax. He smiles, revealing 
only a few, yellowed teeth that are radically out of alignment. The mouth says to me: 
"Excuse me, Mister, but I'm out of gas, and I gotta get home."
1 don't want any trouble. Usually when I get approached like this, I'm moving. 
But now I'm cornered. Trapped. I mentally count the bills in my wallet, wondering 
how long they will stay there. It's too late for me to play dead, but I can sure act help­
less. "Look, pal. I'd like to help, but I kind of have my own problems. I'm stranded 
myself. And I don't have any gas on me at the moment."
This guy is not going to just walk away. In fact, he looks even more eager now 
than before. "Hey, man, we can help each other. You help me get some gas, I'll take

American Dreams
by Shawn Bannon
That was the first time I ever looked 
away from a man staring me in the eyes. 
The rain snapped against the leather on 
my coat, and I felt her cold hand 
wrapped tight around my right wrist. I 
could have swung at him with my left 
arm, but instead I turned away. I heard 
him smile, and I saw the tears slipping 
down her cheeks.
“Please don’t do this," she begged 
me. “They’ll kill you.”
“Give it up, boy,” Eric said from 
behind me in his most smug British 
accent. “The game is over. The girl is
The alley was dark and the puddles 
reflected only a little of the light from 
the glowing street lamps at either end. 
The faint singing of drunken Spaniards 
floated to us from a nearby bar, and a 
horses hooves clapped off the cobble­
stone roads somewhere in the distance.
I started to turn back to Eric when 
Marion pulled me closer to her. She 
was crying harder but couldn’t say any­
thing.
“They’ll kill me anyway,” I whis­
pered to her. “But when I let go of you, 
you have to run. Don’t look back.
Don’t wait for me. Just run.” I stood 
back to look at her one last time. 
“Promise me.” She nodded.
We’d come to Barcelona from Paris 
and to Paris from London. Marion had 
filled her pockets and bags with her 
father’s money—more money than I’d 
ever seen, and for ten pounds we bribed 
our way into the hull of an Indian spice 
ship. Marion was surprisingly delighted 
with the accommodations. Her family 
had never known anything but first 
class, and had she stayed in London to 
marry Eric, she certainly would never 
have spent a night sleeping on a rope 
net hammock in the pitch dark body of 
an old creaking ship. But that first 
night, I felt her heart jump excitedly 
when she pulled my hand over her 
breast, and she breathed it all in. The 
spices. The sailors. The thought that 
now she and I could marry once we 
reached America.
We got off the boat in France
without incident. The French shipyards 
were much less regulated than the 
British, and we simply walked down the 
plank, onto the boardwalk, and disap­
peared into a nearby market. Our 
names never appeared on any passenger 
list or crew registry, and when we took a 
room, we were Mr. and Mrs. Woodrow 
Wilson of Boston.
I didn’t know anyone in- Paris when 
we arrived. Marion had been there 
many times with her mother as a child, 
and then twice with her father after her 
mothers death when she was fourteen. 
Marion believed we could approach a 
couple of the people she knew if we 
needed assistance, but I was weary of 
that.
I’d only been to France in 
1918. I was just a boy. Barely fifteen.
I’d lied to get into the U.S. Army, and 
they took me. After landing in 
Normandy, we marched across the 
French countryside toward Germany.
We were warned to be careful not to 
trample through vineyards if at all possi­
ble, but we never paid any attention to 
that. We were more concerned with 
things like artillery shells and mustard 
gas, though we never minded the chance 
to drink a little of that French wine.
We didn’t go to either the 
museums or the theatre in Paris.
Marion had been more than once and 
refused to go back.
“Those are things that proper 
cultured ladies and gentlemen would do, 
Mr. Wilson,” she playfully told me.
“You, sir, are certainly not cultured, and 
I refuse to be a proper lady ever again.” 
So instead we spent hours at the silent 
cinemas watching trashy Marx Brothers 
comedies and sappy romances. We 
drank in the same bars as the men who 
worked on the Paris railroads, and we 
ate in the same restaurants as women 
who had never seen a diamond let alone 
have four on one ring. Though it 
should be pointed out that Marion had 
pitched that ring into the Thames 
before we left London. We sat at cafés 
by the Seine and watched artists try to 
capture the flowing water on their can­
vases and lovers press their bodies deep

---------------------------------------------------

into the grass along the banks under the 
moonlight.
“What will we do when we 
reach America?” Marion asked, sipping 
from a cup of tea.
“We can do anything.” I told 
her, watching the way she forgot where 
she was and how ingrained the teaching 
of her finishing school really was as she 
set the teacup softly on its saucer. “The 
first thing we’ll do is tour New York 
City. They say it has more lights even 
than Paris now. Then we’ll take a train 
to Chicago and spend some, time with 
my folks.”
“I hope they like me,” Marion 
said. She was looking at the river, but 
her thoughts were a million miles away. 
Probably a big white house and a 
charming woman wrapping her arms 
around both of us as we walked through 
the door.
“My mother will tell you that 
I’m not good enough for you, and my 
father will look at you and wait until he 
and I are alone to elbow me in the ribs 
and tell me how well I’ve done." I 
reached across the table and took her 
hand. Her fingers were so small and 
soft. They fit perfectly between mine.
“I want to be an actress. I want to 
be in the cinema,” she said suddenly. “I 
want to go to California, where they 
make the films. I want us to be married 
in an open American field like we saw 
in that show this afternoon, and I want 
us to have at least three children.” She 
was almost bubbling. Her grip on my 
hand had tightened, and her speech 
became more rapid as she went on. 1 
didn’t want to say anything that might 
stop her.
“Yes," she continued, “I definitely 
want to have at least three children. I 
was an only child, and it can be awfully 
lonely. But it is too easy for two chil­
dren to become rivals. So I think three 
is the number to aim for.”
“Boys or girls?” I couldn’t help but
ask.
“I think, perhaps,” she paused to 
work through the question in her mind, 
“two sons and a daughter. It could be so 
much fun to raise a daughter, and two
boys are not as likely to be as jealous of 
each other as I suspect two girls would 
be. Don’t you agree?” I just smiled and 
nodded my head.
We strolled back to our inn 
through the narrow streets. I was still 
becoming familiar with the city, but 
Marion seemed to know her way even 
through sections she’d never seen before. 
A drunken man approached us and 
asked for the time. He spoke fair 
English for a Parisian who’d had taken 
in too much wine, and I was delighted 
to hear it.
“Close to midnight,” I told him. I 
didn’t have a watch, but I didn’t believe 
he needed the precise minutes.
“What’s the date,” he asked.
“Sir,” Marion said cordially, “it is 
currently July eighteenth, and in a mat­
ter of minutes will be July nineteenth.”
“The year, man!” he shouted, grab­
bing at my jacket. “What year is it?”
“1923,” I answered, putting one 
hand out press Marion away. But the 
man calmed and let go.
“Then the war’s over?” he asked.
“For five years,” I told him.
“That’s good,” he said, standing up 
straight. “When I get home I’m going 
to have to check the papers to sec who 
won.” He pushed past us and continued 
down the street. Marion held her hand 
over her mouth and laughed hard. 1 
took her arm and we walked.
“Someone is going to be an unhappy 
wife when her husband gets home," I said.
The bar was still close to full when 
we reached the inn. I took a pint of 
beer when we went up to our room, and 
we listened to the piano and the men 
bellowing below while we drank and 
made love. I watched her undress slowly 
and carefully. She turned her back when 
she lifted her dress up and over her 
head, and she blew out the oil lamp 
before she turned and came to bed.
I was the only man she’d ever slept 
with. I liked to watch her after we 
made love. She always fell asleep quick­
ly. The little bit of light spilling in 
through the window made it possible for 
me to see and trace the lines of her face 
with my fingertips, pressing them gently 
like a kiss on her lips. Eric had not 
been given that opportunity. Marion 
never permitted him into her closet. 
Their relationship was formal and pos­
sessive. Her father had arranged for her 
to be given as a bride to Eric. A bribe, 
really. Eric was the sole heir to a for­
tune. Old money, of course. It was the 
reason he’d gone into the British army a 
captain. It was the reason he never saw 
combat. It was the reason that the most 
beautiful woman in the world was being 
given away by her father without regard 
for her happiness. He wanted to get his 
hands on a little bit of that wealth—on 
a little bit of that land. Eric wanted to 
get his hands on Marion, and she 
refused him.
We had been in Paris for eight days 
when one of Marion’s acquaintances
spotted us. We were eating salads under 
the shade on a restaurant veranda. It 
was an inexpensive restaurant in a nicer 
part of the city. Marion was wearing 
her hair down like an actress she’d seen 
in the movies a couple of days before. It 
was a new look, and I told her she 
reminded me of an American girl.
“Soon I will be an American girl,” 
she replied.
“Marion?” a woman asked, from 
behind me. I looked across the table, 
but Marion didn’t answer her. I turned 
around and young woman, probably not 
even nineteen, dressed in rich clothes. 
She looked the same as Marion had 
when I first saw her. I tapped Marion’s 
leg with my foot beneath the table and 
she shot straight up.
“Elizabeth,” she finally said. “It’s 
so good to sec you.” I stood and pulled' 
a chair from another table for her. She 
sat exacdy the way she’d been taught. 
Her back never touched the seat back, 
and her legs stayed perfectly together to 
one side.
“Marion,” she said, “I had no idea 
you were coming to Paris.”
“Neither did I,” Marion said. I 
went back to eating my salad.
“Well, what brings you unan­
nounced?” Elizabeth asked. “Is your 
father with you? Or did Eric bring you? 
You know, we just can’t wait to make the 
trip for the wedding.” I looked up at 
Marion, but I didn’t say anything.
“Elizabeth, let me introduce you 
first to John Tucker of Chicago.” She 
turned and shook my hand, then 
Marion continued. “John was writing 
for the papers in London until recently. 
He and I met at an event he was report­
ing on where father was a speaker.
John, this is Elizabeth Rawlington. Her 
father is a businessman in London. 
Elizabeth is here in Paris studying 
Opera. She and I were schoolmates at 
Whillington.”
“Pleased to meet you?” Elizabeth 
said. “It must be very exciting being a 
reporter.”
“It has its moments,” I told her,
“but most of the time you’re just writing 
about rich people who don’t care a whit

about you doing things that won’t in any 
way benefit the lives of anyone but the 
rich. After all, most of the poor can’t 
read the papers anyway.” She looked 
shocked, so I felt I’d accomplished 
something. But it seemed a small feat.
“Don’t mind him,” Marion said. 
“He woke up on the wrong side of the 
bed this morning.” I think that shocked 
her even more. “Now listen, Elizabeth,” 
Marion continued, “You have to promise 
me that you won’t tell anyone you saw 
us. Promise me.”
“Marion, what is going on?” 
Elizabeth asked.
“Promise me you won’t say any­
thing.”
“Alright,” she answered. “But tell 
me what is going on.” I watched quiet­
ly. There was nothing else I could do.
“I’ve left Eric,” Marion said. I 
exhaled the breath I’d been holding in 
and dropped my head. “I don’t love 
him. I don’t want to marry him. I am 
in love with John.”
“I don’t understand,” Elizabeth 
said. “You’re not in love with the gen- 
deman from London with the estates 
and tides. You’re in love with a newspa­
per writer?”
“Ex-newspaper writer,” I interject­
ed. “The gentleman from London had 
me fired and thrown out of my apart­
ment when he found out about us.” 
“John and I are going to America. 
We’re going to be married there.”
Father would never allow it in England, 
and we are too close here in France for 
this to get out. “So I need your help 
now. I need—we need you to keep what 
you know to yourself undl I write you. 
Please tell us you can do that.” Marion 
reached across the table and took my 
hand. Elizabeth sat quietly for a 
moment, looking from Marion’s face to 
mine and then back to Marion's again.
“I will not tell anyone,” she 
said, “but, Marion, I beg you to think 
about what you are doing.”
“I have,” Marion assured her. 
“For three years, all I thought about was 
the miserable life I would have if I mar­
ried Eric. And for the last eight 
months, all I can think about is John
and our love. When I see the ocean or 
breathe in the scent of magnolias.
When I lay to sleep, and in my dreams 
that is all I think about. Isn’t it more 
important I be happy than rich?”
“You certainly won’t be happy 
poor,” Elizabeth said. “Eating the gruel 
other people throw out and living in 
crowded tenements.”
“You’d be surprised,” I told 
her, angrily.
“Elizabeth,” Marion said, “this 
is something I have to do. And I need 
you to help me. Please promise me that 
you’ll not tell anyone you’ve seen us.”
“I promise. I won’t tell any­
one,” Elizabeth said. She stood to leave. 
I got up to take away her chair, but she 
did not permit me. She said goodbye to 
Marion and walked away.
“That was close,” Marion said 
to me, returning to her salad.
“That wasn’t close,” I told her. 
“That was it. We’ve been marked, and 
I’d guess we have about a day and a half 
before your gendeman from London is 
here with a couple of his hired bodies to 
whisk you back to England and dump 
me in the river.”
“But she just told us,” Marion
began.
“I don’t care what she told us,” 
I interrupted her. “Did you see her face 
when she promised not to tell anyone?”
I didn’t wait for a response. “She thinks 
I’m dirt, and she knows for sure that 
you’re just temporarily out of your mind. 
She’ll struggle with this for perhaps two 
or three hours. Then, she’ll wire her 
parents and ask their advice. It won’t be 
long after that until your father knows 
where we are and Eric has set sail for 
France. So, I’d say we’d better be on a 
train or a boat by tomorrow morning if 
we want to avoid him.” I scraped the 
last of my salad out of the bowl and 
waited for Marion to say something.
But she didn’t. She just put her fork in 
her bowl and pushed what was left away.
One of the engineers came back to our 
cabin to see if we were the same Mr. 
and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson that had 
been in the Whitehouse. I told him 
that the President Woodrow Wilson was 
an uncle after whom I was named, but 
he still left disappointed.
The ride from Paris to 
Barcelona took just longer than two days 
with about twelve stops, some in towns 
where it was hard to believe there were 
people let alone a train station. The 
countryside was dark green and the sky 
was bright during the day. The moun­
tains in the distance seemed close 
enough to walk to, but were days away. 
We passed by villages where the children 
ran from their work in the fields to wave 
at the people on the train, and we rode 
through forests were few people had 
ever walked. It was wonderful seeing 
the land so long after the war, after the 
people had put their lives together and 
learned to live without those who never 
came home. I took down notes describ­
ing the individual scenes as they came 
and litde bits of conversation that we 
overheard. The way Marion stared as if 
she had never seen them before in awe 
at the poor in the villages who are per- 
fecdy content to lead their simple lives. 
The Spanish Woman who told her hus­
band that he would not raise their son 
to be a matador. I wrote down, word for 
word, the speech of a priest blessing his 
meal at dinnertime, and I slid the jour­
nal back to the inside pocket of my jacket.
“What are you writing, 
Cowboy,” Marion asked when she woke 
up the second morning. I was sitting by 
the window sketching the landscape 
onto a page in the journal. I had awoke 
with the sunrise and found myself star­
ing out the window at the trees and hills 
passing by.
“Nothing special,” I told her.
“A great American novel, 
maybe,” she asked, sitting up in bed and 
letting the blankets fall around her. She 
was wearing a white cotton nightgown, 
and she looked like an angel. I smiled 
at her, then she blew me a kiss.
“We’ll be in Barcelona soon,” I 
told her. Marion stood up and 
stretched. She walked across the cabin 
and wrapped her arms around me.
“What then?" she asked.
“Well, we can run with the 
bulls.” Marion laughed. “Or I can try 
to get in touch with an old friend of 
mine, Remi, and see if he can’t get us on 
a ship to America.”
“That doesn’t sound especially 
Spanish,” Marion said. “French?”
“Belgian, actually,” I told her. 
“He and I were bedded next to each 
other in a military hospital during the 
war.”
“I didn’t know you were 
injured. Were you shot?” She tickled 
me, pretending to search for the wound.
“No, no, ” I told her. “I fell 
into a ditch and broke my foot. Remi is 
the one that got shot. From what he
We boarded a train for 
Barcelona at just after seven the next 
morning. It was cool, and Marion wore 
my leather jacket over her shoulders.

told me, he was shot four times in the 
back by a German he thought was dead. 
I don’t know how he lived. Anyway, 
we’ve exchanged a few letters since then, 
and if what he’s said is true, he’s got 
some contacts that might be able to get 
us on a ship. I’m banking on it.”
“What made him go to 
Spain?” Marion asked.
“A woman,” I told her.
“He followed her to 
Barcelona?” she asked with romantic 
excitement.
“No,” I answered. “She was in 
Belgium. Barcelona was as far away 
from her as he could get on the money 
in his pocket.”
We pulled into Barcelona, and 
a buggy took us to the address I had for 
Remi. It was near the docks, and we 
could smell the salt in the air from the 
Mediterranean. His was a well kept 
home in a poor neighborhood, and an 
old Spanish woman answered the door 
when I knocked.
“Hola,” she said.
“Hola,” I returned. “Esta 
Remi aqui?” I asked.
“Your Spanish is awful,” the 
old lady said in English. “Follow me.” 
Remi arranged for us to board 
a freighter two days later. He told us 
that he’d-have to take us to the ship 
himself. The captain, he said, was a 
shifty old man, and he didn’t know 
whether or not the old man would let us 
on without him. After leaving 
Barcelona, the ship would dock in 
Lisbon before crossing the Adantic for 
New York City.
Marion and I spent the next 
day and a half walking the streets of 
Barcelona. Neither of us had ever been 
to Spain, and it was very different from 
France. The people seemed friendlier. 
They welcomed us. We were obviously 
outsiders, but they acted like they 
enjoyed our being diere.
Remi was letting us stay with 
him and the old woman who he called 
Rosinante in his home. He gave us his 
guided tour of all the most important 
stops. Interestingly, alcohol was avail­
able and very inexpensive at all of them.
He and Marion hit it off, and he told 
her more than once over a beer about 
the way I’d babied my broken foot while 
he laid next to me with holes through 
his back.
It was late in the afternoon the day 
we were to leave when I first spotted 
one of Eric’s men. It was Jeremy 
Munding. Marion had pointed him out 
to me from a distance a couple of times 
back in London. But this day he was 
sitting alone over a glass that never got 
refilled in a bar where Remi had taken 
us for lunch. He was wearing his usual 
fedora, but it was pulled down hard, 
almost over his eyes. He tossed the 
glass against his mouth every now and 
then, but I didn’t believe he was even 
sipping from it. I intentionally posi­
tioned myself so that he’d always be in 
sight over Remi’s shoulder, and it 
wouldn’t look like I was watching him.
I didn’t point him out to Marion, 
because I was hoping that we would be 
gone before he could report back to 
Eric. But I didn’t know that Eric was in 
Barcelona.
We were going to walk back to 
Remi’s house when we left the bar, but I 
suggested we take a carriage. Remi 
whisded, and a horse drawn buggy 
rolled around the comer to our left. I 
took another look for Munding before 
we stepped into the carriage. It looked 
clear and we were gone.
When we got back to Remi’s 
house, Marion ran up the stairs to the
restroom. I pulled Remi into the 
kitchen, and we chased Rosinante from 
the sauce she was stirring on the stove. 
She mumbled something in Spanish and 
disappeared into the hallway.
“What’s going on?” Remi asked, 
taking a bottle of wine from beneath the 
cabinetry. He held up a glass to offer 
me a drink, but I waved it away.
“I’m going to need a clear head 
tonight,” I told him. “Remi, I think 
Eric is here. Or, at least he’s got men 
here. But I’d bet he’s in Barcelona.”
“But how?” he asked. “You said 
nobody knew where you were going.”
“I don’t know, but none of that 
matters now. We just need to make sure 
we get on that ship.”
“It is not safe for us to walk to the 
docks together,” Remi said. “Here is 
what we do.” Marion walked into the. 
kitchen and slid her arms around my 
waist.
“What are you two talking about?” 
she asked, smiling, still dreaming about 
America. She looked at me and asked if 
I was excited.
“Of course,” I answered. “I’m 
going home.”
“I was just suggesting to our boy 
here,” Remi jumped in, “that I leave a 
litde early tonight and get us a car for 
your last trip through the streets of 
Barcelona.”
“We don’t need that,” Marion said, 
“we’re close enough to the docks to 
walk.”
“Madame,” Remi said, taking her 
hand in his and bending to kiss it. “I 
insist.”
A couple of hours before we 
were to board the ship, Remi left us 
alone in his house. The plan was for 
Marion and I to wait half an hour and 
go through the back door. An alley 
across the road would lead us to where 
Remi was waiting with a car to take us 
to the docks.
“This is it,” Marion said while we 
packed everything into two large sacks. 
“In a few short hours we’ll be on our 
way to America.
“Home,” I said. Marion hugged 
me again.

---------------------------------------------------

"Okay..."
"We — Eva and I — we were dancing last night. And I kissed her."
Davey grew very still. "You kissed her?" she asked.
I nodded.
"Oh."
"Davey — I'm — I'm sorry. It's just that things have been so strained here late- 
ly, and—"
She cut me off. "You've been attracted to her for a long time, haven't you?"
I nodded again.
She stood up. Her jaw was tightened and she had lifted her chin; she was look­
ing out the window. "Perry. . . look," she said. "This isn't something I want to deal 
with right now. I have the case coming up. I know I'm shutting this out, but I just 
can't work through this with you." She walked into the bedroom; I followed her.
"Here," she said, pulling some of my things out of the dresser. "I'd really prefer 
it if you just slept in the guest bedroom until we can get this straightened out."
"What do you think we should do?" I asked.
She turned towards me and she was scowling. "Look Perry," she said in a voice 
that was too low and too measured, spitting out each word. "I can't make up your 
mind for you. If you decide that this thing you have for Eva is more important than 
what we've had for the past year and a half, then I really can't do anything about it. 
You're just going to have to decide what you want."
I couldn't argue with her — I couldn't do anything to make it worse or more dif­
ficult and awkward. So I took the proffered clothes and trudged up the spiral stair­
case to the little guest bedroom that had once been the building's attic.
A few weeks later, though, when I was still sleeping by myself and Davey would­
n't talk to me beyond asking for the orange juice in the morning, my world got 
turned upside down. Rolling Stone sent me a job offer to work out of their New York 
City office as a writer. I told Davey.
"That's incredible, Perry," she said, smiling — a little bit sadly, I thought; and we 
talked about plans for the lease and moving out and dividing up the pots and pans.
I asked her if she'd drive the U-Haul up to New York for me.
"Sure," she said.
"Thanks." I got her a plane ticket from LaGuardia back to Tampa International 
so she'd only be gone for a weekend.
And I realized that if I left things up to Eva's whims I might not ever see her 
again. So I went back to the Masquerade.
va didn't see me when I walked in; she was too busy dancing on the floor 
with Brett, a mutual friend of ours. I got a drink and watched them for 
a while since there was no point in interrupting her.
Eva danced; Brett, who was wearing leather pants, glided his 
hands over her hips a little bit.
As I watched, I saw Brett put his hand on her cheek and she stopped dancing. 
He pulled her off the floor and they went over by one of the shadowed tables along 
the perimeter of the floor. Since I was along the railing, overlooking the sunken 
floor-pit, I had an almost unobstructed view of them. Brett leaned towards her and 
I tried not to watch, but my eyes returned to the two as they kissed; he leaned 
towards her and she intertwined her fingers with his. She closed her eyes, I could 
see. Brett touched his mouth to hers and they paused — just so — for a moment. 
And then he put his arm around her waist, pulled her close to him, and pressed his 
mouth against hers.
I left.
I re-entered the club a half hour later. Eva and Brett were drinking bottled water 
by the bar; I waved at them and walked over, swallowing the lump in my throat.
"Hi, Perry," they said together.
"Hey, guys. Good night tonight?"
"Excellent," said Brett. "In fact, it's been so great that I need to go find Tanker 
and give him a big, fat hug."
I smiled. "Later, man," I said.
Eva pulled him towards her and they kissed. '"Bye, doll. See you later," she 
said.
She waved good-bye to him with a small gesture. He left; she looked after him 
as he walked away.
"You were here earlier," she said presently, looking at me.
"Huh? Oh — yeah. I had to leave to get food." I paused. "I didn't know you were 
able to tell people apart in all the crowd."
"I can spot you anywhere," she said with that teasing look in her eyes. "Where's 
Davey?"
"Doing work. Dogma's in court about the anti-rave ordinance." I hesitated a
moment too long for it to be a normal pause. "You're seeing Brett?"
"Yeah.. . we started dating three weeks ago."
"It's going well, I take it."
"Well enough," she said, leaning forward a little. I probably shouldn't have, but 
I couldn't help glancing down at where her shirt collar pulled away from her chest, 
exposing more of her cleavage than she deliberately showed. She grinned. "The
sex is great."
I was uncomfortable talking about her and Brett, and more so about Brett's sex­
ual skills. Brett came bounding back as I was about to change the subject.
"Ready to go?" he asked Eva, snaking his arm around her waist.
She gave a knowing smile. "Sure am," she said. "Perry, I'll catch you later. 
Email me."
"Eva, wait."
They stopped and looked at me.
"Actually, Eva, I was wondering if you had time to talk for a few minutes."
Brett took the hint. "Eva, I'll catch you outside. Perry, good seeing you."
Eva and I walked into one of the lounges.
"So, Perry, what's up?"
"I'm leaving," I said with far too much finality in my voice.
"You're leaving?" She sounded puzzled at my melodrama.
"I got a job offer from Rolling Stone, in their New York office. I'm taking it."
"That's awesome!"
I couldn't bring myself to ask her about our kiss or anything else.
"Davey's driving most of my stuff up and she's leaving the day before me," I 
said. "But I was wondering if you'd see me off — you know, just stop by."
"Oh, sure! When are you leaving?"
"Urn, the thirtieth, I think — four weeks from Saturday."
"Okay, can do. What time?"
"Six a.m. Is that too early?"
"No, not at all." She grinned. "I just won't go to sleep the night before."
I looked at her, briefly making eye contact and breaking it almost instantly. 
"Thanks," I said. "It means a lot to me."
She looked at me, smiling, placing her hand on my arm. My skin tingled a little 
bit where she touched me.
"Hey, Perry," she said, the din of the club echoing around us. "No problem. I'll 
be there."
Almost before I knew what was happening she was in my arms, hugging me. I 
didn't want to hold her too closely and feel her body press against mine, curving— 
against my chest, but at the same time that's the very reason I pulled her closer. 
After the briefest of moments, she tightened her grip and loosened it, telling me that 
our hug was over.
Then we left; she walked away with Brett, and I walked back to my car alone.
Four weeks later — Davey had moved out and into another apartment. My 
little green Neon was packed to the roof with stuff I hadn't been able to put in the 
U-Haul. Davey had left on Friday night with the truck since it was slower going and 
she needed the extra time.
It was seven in the morning on Saturday and Eva still wasn't there. The 
sunlight was just starting to make the day hot and humid. I drummed my fingers on 
the windowsill. I made up a lede for an article in my head. I looked as far up Thirty- 
Second Avenue as I could, peering through the palm trees and Spanish moss, to see 
if her ratty old Jeep was tearing down the red brick street. But it wasn't. So I left the 
apartment and gave the key to my landlord.
I paused by the car door and looked for Eva one last time and once more, she 
wasn't there. So I got on the road, crossing Tampa Bay — its water glittering in the 
sunlight — and turned on to 1-4 just past downtown Tampa. I was playing a techno 
CD with its empty rhythm blasting around me as I drove past Exit 1, craning my neck 
for my last look at Ybor City and only thinking about how Eva had never shown up.

enough that you could have a study. And we could even rent out that empty studio 
in the attic if you wanted to, so you could have more space. What do you think?" I 
traced my fingers up her leg a little.
"I think you're drunk. Perry," she said, pushing my hand away. "Watch it. We're 
in public and you're acting like a high schooler."
I wasn't drunk though, and I told her that I had only had two beers.
She sighed. I was starting to get scared.
"Davey," I said, reaching for her hand. "I don't — I'm not sure how to say this. 
I just — I want to wake up to you every morning."
She relaxed and smiled a little. "Awww, how sweet," she said as she rolled her 
eyes. "Perry, it's not you. I just need to think about whether I'm ready to move in 
with someone."
"Davey, I want to do your laundry," I said, making my eyes as big and pitiful as 
I could. "I want to cook you breakfast every morning. I want to water the plants."
At this she burst out laughing — she never bought plants because she always 
ended up killing them and I knew it — and ate a maraschino cherry from the bar.
"Let me think about it," Davey told me, and two weeks later she said okay.

By the time Eva and I had known each other for about two years we had prob­
ably only gone out nine or ten times. It was a mid-December afternoon when we
met to have a late lunch at an outdoor café )n Central Avenue, the street that pass­
es for a downtown in St. Petersburg, and it had to have been the first time in a year 
and a half that we had done something bes des clubbing. I was nervous about see­
ing her. It had been a long time, almost four months, since I had last been to the 
Masquerade.
The past three times we had seen eac i other I had deliberately neglected to 
mention that Davey and I were living toget 
and I dating: her phone calls were unusua 
morning breakfast at her place was foreign 1 
the possibility.
"Want some more tabouli?" I asked her, 
meals. ___________________________________________
"Nah, thanks. I'm fine." She paused, and continued: "You remember Louise, 
right? She's dating Andy."
, "Yeah, sure." _ . - v _ l ‘:- 
i’ ,¦ "Louise ¡s.pregnapt,'c€va, picjted'at the gold tablecloth a little, a nervous habit 
she had whenever she was near table linens of any sort. Her grin was gone.
"From Andy? You're kidding."
"Nope. She's — she was pregnant, I mean. She had an abortion. Andy doesn't 
know." We were in a courtyard with trees; a breeze from Tampa Bay rustled the 
leaves enough to let a couple of rays of sun shine on her hair. It almost sparkled.
"Wow. That would really embitter me if I were him and I found out."
"She didn't think she had a choice — about either, getting the abortion or telling 
him."
"Why couldn't she tell him? It's not like he'd beat her, or even try to make her 
keep it."
"Well — you remember how they started out, right? He was kind of her protec­
tor, her big brother, her friend. And she just didn't think she could bring something 
so — so, I dunno, so serious into their relationship."
"So serious? That's insane. It's his child,-to©^--------------------------------------
should have known about, but I can see why she did it."
I stirred my iced tea. "Hey," I said, changing the subject. "Did I tell you 
about the party next weekend at Tanya's?"
We went on and finished our lunch.
It was a month or two later when Tampa passed its anti-rave ordinance. The 
Masquerade deliberately violated the ordinance along with several other Ybor clubs 
by staying open past the three a.m. deadline. The Masquerade is run by Dogma 
Clubs, so when Tampa slapped the Masquerade with a thirty-thousand dollar fine 
Davey was the one who had to challenge the ordinance in court and straight on up 
through the appeals process.
So I basically didn't see Davey for the next few months. She would go to work 
early and stay late and she practically went straight to sleep as soon as she got 
home at night. I had a two-to-eleven shift at The Times five days a week, so I was 
lucky if I saw her for an hour or two a day.
Davey was busy and stressed; I was miserable. She'd snap at me for leaving my 
underwear on the floor, for turning the lights on when she was sleeping — and for 
a host of other problems that she said she'd never have if she were still living alone.
So one Thursday after work I drove over to Ybor instead of trekking home to 
Davey, pacing in her study and poring over law books.
And that's when Eva and I kissed.
L
called Eva the next night, after I had washed the spikes out of my hair 
and taken off my boots and climbed back in front of my computer ter­
minal at The Times building. No one else was around except for the 
copy clerks, who stalked by every half hour or so to make sure that 
wasn't causing any work for them.
"Hi." What did my voice sound like? I wondered.
"Hey, Perry. What's up?"
"Not much. . . Hey, do you want to go get coffee or something tonight?"
"I can't. I have work to do." She sounded like she always did.
"Oh... Rough. I'll talk to you later then."
"Going to Masquerade next Thursday?"

just didn't want to put that over their heads, I think — you know how something like 
that can just completely change the nature of a relationship. It's just taking it a step 
beyond, a step further, and I don't think she wanted it that way." She shivered a lit­
tle bit; winters are warm along the gulf coast of Florida, but it was still cool and she 
was wearing a short-sleeved dress. She had a little lace top on underneath the 
dress, which was a sort of sundress made out of a soft, silky-looking material. It was 
pastel and floral, things she always claimed she hated. But it was a nice change 
since I was so used to seeing her in plastic and glitter.
"He'll be damn pissed if he ever finds out, though."
"I know. But she's taking that chance."
"Just because she wants to keep the relationship the same?" I asked.
"Guess so," she answered matter-of-factly.
I digested this for a moment.
"Sounds like denial," I said. "Louise just wants everything to stay the 
same, so she's suppressing this huge incident."
Eva shrugged. "Yeah, I guess it's wrong, 'cause that's something I think he

“Home,” she repeated. Then she 
kissed me. “Let’s not wait.”
“What do you mean?” I asked.
“I mean, let’s go now,” she said. 
“There’s a restaurant on the other side of 
that alley, and we can sit at one of their 
outside tables and wait for Remi. It’ll 
give us one last chance to drink in the 
culture.”
“I think we better wait,” I told her. 
“Just run down the alley, jump in the 
car, and head for the ship.” But she 
pulled me toward the back door, drag­
ging one of the bags in her other hand.
“Come on,” she said. “It’ll be fun.”
I couldn’t tell her no. God, I wish I had 
told her no. But instead, I slung the 
bags over my shoulders and let her lead 
me out the door.
It had begun raining shortly before 
dark, and had been coming down steady 
for the hour and a half since. Marion 
took a newspaper to cover her head as 
we walked down the alley behind the 
house. There were no lights, and we 
were halfway to the street when Eric 
spoke up behind us.
“I hope the two of you have had a 
fantastic litde holiday,” he said. Marion 
jumped, but I just dropped the bags and 
turned around. “I’ve had quite a time 
tracking you down. You are a bit more 
cunning than the foxes we hunt at 
home. But I assume you’ll bleed just the 
same.” He was holding a pistol at his 
side. Both Munding and another man I 
did not recognize were pointing their 
pistols at me. “You didn’t think about 
the fact that yours was the only train to 
leave Paris the other day?”
“I just didn’t think you were intelli­
gent enough to pick up on that,” I told 
her
“Whatever made you think you 
could have her?” Eric asked me, step­
ping closer. He was slightly taller than 
me, but with a weak build.
“I guess it was by rugged good 
looks and undeniable charm," I 
answered.
He spit in my face. That’s 
when Marion grabbed my wrist and I 
turned away.
When I turned back to Eric, I 
heard Marion’s footsteps as she dropped 
the paper and took off down the alley. I 
swung one of the bags with our things 
around and knocked Eric down, but 
Munding shot me in the side. I turned 
to see Marion, but I fell into the water 
on the street. The guns fired three or 
four more times. The shots echoed off 
the walls, and the pistols spit fire that lit 
up the entire corridor. I heard the bul­
lets as they smacked into the cobble­
stone and then Marion screamed.
I pressed my fists into the 
stone and groaned to push myself up. 
The rain poured into my eyes, blurring 
my vision, but I could see her lying on 
the ground near the end of the alley. I 
tried to crawl, but the pain was great, 
and I was losing blood quickly. I could­
n’t get to her fast enough.
“Idiots,” Eric yelled. I rolled over 
in time to see him run past. He knelt 
on the ground. I remember thinking 
that he was ruining his expensive pants. 
“You’ve shot her. My God, you’ve shot 
her.” Munding and the other man ran 
after him, begging him to quiet down, 
but Eric raised his own pistol and shot 
Munding dead. His fedora jumped off 
of his head as his body twisted, and he 
dropped against the wall and then to the 
ground.
When Eric turned his gun on 
the other man, they fired at each other. 
The other man fell backwards and Eric 
raised his hands to his own throat. I 
could see the blood pouring over his fin­
gers, and he reached out toward me for 
assistance as I crawled up the alley. I 
took a deep breath and smiled at him 
while I watched him die.
The bullet had entered Marion’s 
back, and it hit her lung. She recog­
nized me when I turned her over onto 
my lap, but she couldn’t speak. I 
screamed for help, but I could not yell 
loud enough. The rain and the singing 
drunks in a nearby bar drowned out the 
sound. It hurt to hold her head up and 
beg her to hold on, but help could not 
arrive fast enough. She mouthed that 
she loved me, and I kissed the blood 
from her lips. She died in my arms 
before Remi arrived.
I sailed home on a passenger ship 
when they let me out of the hospital two 
weeks later. My parents were waiting 
for me in New York. My father said my 
mother was worried to death about me. 
She said she thought I was done getting 
shot at when the war ended. I showed 
them a picture of Marion that I’d stolen 
from her father’s home after setting up 
an interview with him just so I could see 
her. When we got back to Chicago, I 
would put it in a box and never look at 
it again. I’d slept a lot on the ship, but I 
couldn’t get comfortable in the bed on 
the train from New York. I spent the 
train trip home staring out the window 
of our cabin. At a stop in Pennsylvania, 
near a small Amish town, I tossed my 
journal into a trash bin.

Eva and I were in the center of the flooK 
now on again, in that strange, transient way c 
covered in sweat. I looked at her.
I stopped dancing. Right there, in the m c
"Eva..." I said. She couldn't hear me, of c
I put my right hand on her neck; my left on I 
around my back as I pulled her sweaty, slick body towards mine. I kissed her: first 
our lips touched; we almost hesitated. My hand moved from her neck to the back of 
her head; and we kissed, Eva pressing her mouth to mine as her nails dug into my 
back just a little. Her mouth was sweet from the Gatorade she had had a little earli­
er and both of our chests heaved from the dancing we had just been doing. I could 
feel the vinyl of our pants sticking together.
We separated after a few seconds. She was still and looked at me. I wasn't sure 
what would happen next. She smiled — grinned, quickly — and started dancing 
again.
"What are you waiting for?" she yelled over the noise, spinning to the music. A
there, and they pierced it, and I said, 'Ow, fuck,' and it was over."
"Gotcha." We weren't dating but she was attractive and I thought of her going 
down on her boyfriend with her tongue piercing. So I was a little jealous. "I got a 
tattoo last month," I said.
"Oh, cool! Where? What of?"
"Blue Devil— "
"Not where did you get it, where is it?"
"Huh? Oh, it's on my shoulder blade. Here, look." I pulled my shirt over a little 
so she could see the tattoo — the Chinese character that represented strength.
"Neato. Are you going to dance with me tonight?" She gave me a sly look from 
the corner of her eyes and batted her eyelashes just a touch. She grinned.
"Hey, why else would I have put these stupid things on?" I said, pointing to the 
vinyl pants I was wearing. We worked our way to the floor and started to dance; I 
left soon after, when she left me there, alone on the floor, as she spun high above.
When I first met Davey she saw me at a bad time — I had the flu and hadn't 
showered in four days, but there I was in Eckerd's, trying to find some more medi-

few minutes later she climbed up to the top of one of the pillars, which one of the 
hired dancers had just climbed down from. She had touched my arm when she left 
but didn't say anything and a few moments later I was left watching as she glittered 
from the top of the pedestal. I couldn't tell if she was watching me; probably, she 
couldn't even see me since bright spotlights shone on her as she danced. She was 
alone up there, shining, glittering, and turning as the music blasted her from every 
direction. ------------------------>II oooooeeeeeee——J
That night was a Thursday — techno night at the Masquerade. Two months 
since I had last been to the club and two months since I had last seen Eva. I had 
parked three blocks away from Seventh Avenue, but even before I got out of my car 
I could hear the bass and the backbeat of Ybor City. I took my time double-checking 
to make sure that I had hidden my CDs under the car seat: Eva wouldn't be at the 
Masquerade until after midnight and it was only 11:45 or so.
The Masquerade was a few blocks away, its blue neon sign perched high­
er than any other in that little section of Tampa. Take your time, I told myself: so I 
listened to a street musician playing steel drums for a few minutes. I bought a fun­
nel cake which I couldn't bring myself to eat and ended up feeding to a flock of seag­
ulls. I picked up a copy of the St. Petersburg Times and read a couple of my articles 
in the weekly entertainment section; I read the Reuters story about Dogma Clubs 
and the lawsuit they were involved in, a lawsuit that my girlfriend Davey was han­
dling.
Finally, after I had stalled long enough, I paid my cover and went into the club.
I hadn't called ahead to tell Eva to look for me but she noticed me anyway. 
She was drinking Gatorade in the club's lounge when she saw me; she raised Jier 
eyebrows and waved me over. Her whitish blonde hair was already damp from the 
dancing she had been doing.
"HI,'’ she said.
"Big night?" I asked. "You look like you've been at it pretty hard."
"No more than usual. At least you've finally gotten your lazy ass down here."
I stared at her. 'You got your tongue pierced!" I said. "When?"
"Ummm... 'bout two months ago, at the Blue Devil."
"Did it hurt?"
"Nah. Well — a little, but nothing I couldn't live with. Basically I was sitting
cine. I had been staring at the cold and flu remedies without moving for a,~fujl 
minute or so, just staring, not even looking at the labels, when I noticed her giving 
me strange looks out of the corner of her eye all the way from the vitamin secjion; 
She had shortish black hair and was wearing an expensive-looking blade spit. I 
shook my head a little and muttered something to myself, "Perry, come on, getNa 
grip," and tried to force myself to read the labels again.
A second later she walked up and tapped me on the shoulder.
"Do you need some help?"
"Oh — urn," and I think I gave her the sort of look that a sixteen-year-old .boy 
gives to a nineteen-year-old girl who's just said something flirtatious to him. Kind of 
like Dopey in Snow White. But then, I think my unwashed hair and the gamey- 
smelling corduroys that I had been wearing for a week and a half kept my appeal to 
a minimum. Dopey may have been homely, but at least he didn't smell bad.
She looked at me, raising her eyebrows and expecting a response.
"I, eh —" I shook my head— "guess I've kind of been out of it. I've got the flu 
and I ran out of medicine, but I don't remember what kind I had. Vicks of some form 
or another."
She skimmed over the labels.
"Here, take this one," she said, smiling, handing me a boxed bottle. Her eyes 
were blue and she had a little pen mark at the right side of her mouth. "Hope you
feel better."
"Thanks," I said as she went back to the vitamin section.
I went to get some ginger ale. I ended up at the checkout counter just before she 
did.
"Thanks again for helping me out," I said, collecting my change.
"No problem." She paused and tilted her head to the side. "You look familiar. 
But I don't think I've ever met you."
"I'm a columnist for The Times," I offered, as she paid for her vitamins.
"That's it — music editor, right? You've got that little picture each week." 
"Yeah, um. I'm Perry Brummer."
"Davey Moore," she said, as we shook hands. She had nice legs, I noticed, and 
a firm handshake.
We started walking out together. "How'd you know?" I asked her.
"How'd I know what?"
"That I'm the music editor."
"Oh — I'm an attorney, I work for MacKee & Wilkes. I handle Dogma Clubs 
Management so I pay attention to industry news."
"Dogma Clubs," I said. "Don't they manage half of Clearwater Beach?"
"Nah," she said. We had reached her car, a silver Miata, and stopped. "You're 
thinking Beach Entertainment Management. Dogma owns half of Ybor and half of 
Orlando."
I let out a laugh. "The half that Disney doesn't own."
She laughed, too. "Yeah, that." She started to get into her car.
"Well — it was nice meeting you. Hey —" I paused; I looked at the pavement 
and then at her, feeling a little dizzy — "Do you want to go get lunch sometime?"
"Sure," she said. She was carrying a DayTimer and pulled out a business card. 
“Email works for me. Drop me a note and we can set up a time." She smiled. "See 
/ou later, Perry."
I emailed her a few days later from work; I had taped her card up on the cubicle 
wall that surrounded my desk. "To dmoore at mckee-dot-com," I muttered to myself 
3s I typed in her address. "Davey my message said. "Well, now that I've stopped 
downing the Vicks - formula 44M, which I'm never going to forget again -- do you 
want to grab lunch some time this week? My schedule's pretty flexible, so name a 
time. My number here is 397-4286 if you need to call."
I sent the message and instantly wished I hadn't. I shouldn't have said my

schedule was so flexible, I thought. I'll look like I don't have anything to do with 
myself. I debated sending her another email that said I was busy on Thursday after 
all and possibly on Wednesday, too. But then I decided that I just wanted to see 
more of her and I didn't really care whether she thought I was a loser or not.
She emailed me back that day and we decided to go to Java Street on Thursday 
at one o'clock. I spent some extra time messing with my hair on Thursday morning 
and I fidgeted all day at my desk — the only work I could do was CD reviews and I 
spent longer than ususal reading through my mail. Finally, at twelve forty-five I left 
my desk and walked the two blocks over to Java Street.
I ordered coffee at ten after.
I ordered a sandwich at half-past.
I ordered a dessert at a quarter till two.
At two o'clock I paid my bill and walked back to The Times building, my head 
down. I checked my email; there was no message from her. The light on my phone 
told me that I didn't have any voicemail.
Davey called me the next morning.
"Perry Brummer," I said, picking up the phone.

would imitate her. I never saw her pay cover.
I noticed her the first night I was there. She was wearing black latex pants and 
a shiny orange shirt. Her hair was a pale blonde, almost white from the bleach that 
she used, and her dark plucked eyebrows arched over her rather narrow eyes.
We had a mutual friend, Andy, who introduced us. We couldn't talk in the club, 
of course, but afterwards the four of us — Eva, me, Andy, and Louise, another of 
Eva's friends — went out and got tea at one of Ybor City's coffeehouses.
That first moment when we left the club and stepped out into the irritatingly 
humid Tampa night was jolting. I was seeing her under the dozens of French-quar- 
ter street lamps instead the blinking, flickering lights of the club. She shimmered 
and glistened under the yellow-white lights; the plastic of her pants and the silver 
glitter in her hair blended perfectly with the pavement and the neon lights.
The street wasn't deserted; it rarely is in Ybor City; but the rambling crowds that 
saunter up and down the middle of the street in the earlier night were gone, 
replaced by the small streams of people leaving the clubs that line Seventh Avenue. 
A few stray party-goers - like us - landed in the coffeehouses and restaurants that

getting too old for all of this."
She laughed. "I probably am too," she said, "but I'm going to be immature 
about it for as long as I can get away with it."
The show was good that night from what I can remember — which wasn't 
much. We couldn't talk too easily but 1 could watch her out of the corner of my eye.
I even caught her looking at me a couple of times.

fey and I continued to date. We'd sometimes go to the Masquerade — she 
met Eva there one night and liked her — or to shows, but most of the 
j time Davey and I would just hang out at her apartment or mine and talk. 
We could sit up for hours on end, covering every subject under the sun, 
drinking coffee like college students and I never got tired of her company.
After eight months I asked her to move in with me, into my apartment on Thirty- 
Second and First Street North. We were at Bar Zero in St. Pete, waiting for a 
Ramones concert to start in the courtyard outside.
"Davey," I said, touching her on the knee as we sat at the bar drinking 
Guinesses. She swivelled around to face me.
"What?"
I took a deep breath. "I think we should, um —" I paused for a moment and
