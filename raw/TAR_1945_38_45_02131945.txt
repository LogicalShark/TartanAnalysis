Religious Emphasis 
Placed On AFFMM 
For Week of Feb. 20
The letters AFFMM printed on 
many campus posters recently have 
caused much curiosity and specula­
tion. Day by day a new word was 
revealed until finally appeared the 
phrase “A Faith for Modern Man.” 
This is to be the theme of Religious 
Discussion Week; it is not a title of 
a book, but the trend of thought the 
various speakers will follow. All 
campus organizations, fraternities, 
and sororities will sponsor a speak­
er who will speak in the dining­
rooms, and lead the general discus­
sions in the evening. On Tuesday, 
February 20, 1945, there will be an 
all-student chapel in Little Theater. 
The same day a dinner will be held 
in Carnegie Union for all the stu­
dents followed by all around dis­
cussion later in the evening.
Tuesday of this week, February
13, 1945 Reverend Vernon Smith 
will be speaker at a chapel design­
ed as a preliminary meeting in 
which plans for emphasis week will 
be discussed. The topic of his speech 
will be, “Finding Foundations For 
Faith,” and will lead up to the main 
theme— A Faith For Modern Man.
Col. Paul J. Dowling 
Now Commands ROTC
Colonel Paul James Dowling of 
the Infantry replaces Major Ray­
mond W. Boberg as commanding of­
ficer of the ROTC and Professor of 
Military Science and Tactics at Car­
negie Institute of Technology.
Colonel Dowling served with the 
Infantry in World War I and re­
mained in the regular army, with 
various assignments, among them 
the Philippines. He was Professor of 
Military Science and Tactics of the 
ROTC at Valley Forge Military 
Academy from January 1, 1942 to 
March, 1944, following which he 
served in the same capacity at 
Western Maryland College until 
September, 1944. For a short time he 
was Commanding Office at Fort 
Eustis, Va., and until his assignment 
to the Carnegie Tech campus, was 
a member of the Permanent Retir­
ing Board, Headquarters, Third 
Service Command.
I. Aisenberg Heads

Spring Drive For War Stamps 
Opens With Super Assembly
At an assembly yesterday C. I. T. 
students were informed of a plan in 
which each would be responsible 
for buying one 25 cent war stamp 
each week. This plan will take the 
place of the regular spring war bond 
drive since the 7th War Loan Drive 
will not be started until May.
The drive is under the supervision 
of the C. I. T. War Activities Com­
mittee chairman, Mr. V. G. Parisi. 
Four booths will be set up; in Indus­
tries, Margaret Morrison, Fine Arts, 
and the Canteen. They will be open 
on Monday and Wednesday of every 
week until the end of the semester. 
The booths in Industries, Margaret 
Morrison, and Fine Arts will be 
open from 9:00 until 5:00; the one 
in the Canteen, from 11:00 until 
2:00 and 3:00 until 5:00.
Iris Kwall is the chairman of the 
Student War Stamp Drive. The 
chairman of the booth in Industries 
is Dick Herrmann, of the booth in 
Margaret Morrison, Celia Whitney, 
of the booth in Fine Arts, Melva 
Brooks, and of the one in the Can­
teen, Cottie Lowry. Poster chair­
man is Gus Kermes and publicity 
chairman is Adeline Herlick.

Delta Tau Delta Holds 
Rushing Tea Party
One of the outstanding rushing 
parties these last two weeks was 
the Delta Tea Party Tuesday after­
noon. The Delts made it their own 
“get-together” party, so that the 
entering freshmen could meet some 
of the freshman girls.
The Delt house was crowded from 
five to eight with students dancing, 
playing bridge, listening to piano 
boogie, or just talking. A light lunch 
was served at six o’clock. After­
ward the Delts and their guests sang 
Tech and Delt songs.
cards are expected to buy at least 
one stamp each week. More stamps 
may be bought, but they can not be 
counted as the regular weekly con­
tribution; two stamps bought every 
other week will not be considered 
as fulfillment of the pledge. For 
those students who have not yet 
signed pledge cards there will be 
extra cards at the booths. Stamp 
books will also be available at the 
booths. Only 25 cent stamps will be 
on sale, but they can be used in 
books of other denominations. Any­
one who wants to buy a bond for the 
same drive may do so in the Cash­
ier’s office, open from 9:00 until 
4:00 Monday through Friday.
Carnegie Tech is sponsoring a 
heavy field ambulance, which will 
bear a decal with Tech’s name on 
it. The cost of the ambulance is ap­
proximately $3,430.00, a goal which 
we can easily reach if every student 
cooperates. Giving 25 cents each 
week is little enough to do for one’s 
country; it is certainly not too great 
a sacrifice for anyone. Not many 
students can buy war bonds but 
every one can buy one 25 cent stamp 
each week. We can put this drive 
over if we all cooperate.
Representative Chosen 
For Activities Council
On Wednesday, February 7, the 
Engineering School elected Dick 
Herrman as its representative to 
the Activities Council.
The actual count is as follows:
Richard Herrmann ......................63
August Binder .............................54
William Scherb ...........................35
The turnout at the voting places 
showed a great improvement in stu­
dent interest in campus politics. 
Seventy per cent of the college cast 
ballots.

story of Hugh Walpole’s. It will be 
directed by Miss Mary Morris, and 
have a triple cast.
The characters are as follows:
May Beringer
Mary Laura Wood 
Sally Ann Rosenberg

Geneva Triumphs 
Over C.I.T.; 61-45
Penn State Defeats 
C.I.T. Team Again
The Geneva Covenanters, lop­
sided pre-game favorites to trounce 
the Carnegie Tartans, needed an 
early fourth quarter spurt to sub­
due the fighting spirit of Maxie’s 
boys. The Plaid was completely out- 
manned, but they were certainly not 
outplayed as they went down bat­
tling to the score of 61-45.
The Covenanters were expected 
to have a picnic, having breezed to a
65-35 win earlier in the season, and 
against the full squad. Saturday 
night they did not show their cali­
ber as they missed shots from every 
angle, including sure shots and easy 
layups.
The Tartans drew first blood 
when Katselas sank a free throw, 
but McComb of Geneva came 
through with a basket to send the 
visitors into a lead they never re­
linquished. Continuing with their 
fine brand of ball handling, the Tar­
tans finally whittled their opponents 
lead to 12-10 at the end of the first 
quarter. The fine playing of Lipp 
and DeVenzio was all that kept Ge­
neva in the lead.
The second quarter was Geneva 
all the way. Tech suffered an early 
blow when Vince Fastuca was re­
moved for five fouls, halfway 
through this second period. Johnny 
Ackerman, a freshman, broke into 
the lineup in this quarter, and show­
ed exceptional ball handling abil­
ity for his first game before the local 
crowd. The second quarter ended 
with the score at 30-19.
Returning after half time, the 
Tartans showed that they will never 
give up. With a lively attack they 
nearly closed the gap, until they 
trailed only 32-29. Lipp and Pod- 
bielski, however, went to work and 
stretched the lead to 42-33 at the 
conclusion of the third quarter. This 
period was the only one in which 
Tech outscored the Gold and White, 
tallying fourteen points to Geneva’s 
twelve.
The final quarter was the worst

Notice
Miss Virginia Alexander will 
speak on “You and Your Clothes,” 
February 14 at 4:00 in Recreation 
Hall of Margaret Morrison. She is 
addressing the Home Economics 
Club primarily, but this interesting 
talk on relating clothes with per­
sonality would interest all of C. I. 
T.’s femmes fatales. Miss Alexan­
der is leaving Tech after this se­
mester, so all girls who will not 
have the opportunity to have her 
as a teacher in Costume Design 
should be especially interested.

The name of Helen Wasserman was 
omitted by an error from the list of

Your Pledge To Yourself
At some time or other last week, you signed a pledge card promising 
to buy one 25 cent stamp a week until the end of the semester. Your own 
integrity insists that you keep your promise.
You may be a member of one of the two classes of students signing 
these cards. One group signed because they wanted to sign. The other 
signed because they wanted to avoid conspicousness when everyone else 
was signing.
The first group needs no prodding. They undoubtedly realize the im­
portance of their contribution. It is the second group which must be 
made to understand why they should have made the pledge for reasons 
other than those distinguishing them.
The war stamp drive is not to be considered a perpetual tag day or 
weekly raffle. It is rather a simple way to lend, not give, money to our 
government to pay for the expensive operation war. Too many stu­
dents may feel that they need not make any personal contributions be­
cause their parents are doing all the war bond buying for the family. They 
don’t seem to realize that the outcome of the war will directly influence 
their future lives. In view of this it is not natural that they should make 
some definite move towards seeing that their future is arranged as they 
wish it? Maybe the “second groupers” may think that their quarter every 
week is just a quarter out the window. Have they not heard that the 
quarters they pay for defense stamps are actually investments? Have 
they not heard that when they get 75 25 cent stamps they can turn them 
in for a defense bond— an investment of $18.75 that will bring them $25.00 
at the end of ten years?
Surely everyone can afford 25 cents a week for this purpose. It is not 
too much to ask. The students on this campus have been fortunate enough 
to be able to pursue a college career. Hundreds of thousands of young men 
have been asked to give their lives or part of their lives to the great 
effort. You are asked to give an insignificant part of your weekly allow­
ance to help them.
Keep your pledge. When you break your promise, you break the life 
of some serviceman. You break the heart of someone he has left behind. 
As a young person you can not afford to have anything like this on your 
conscience.
This is a pledge to yourself. Don’t let yourself down.
One of the Profs
A Good Deed
We’d like to give Pan-Hellenic Council a pat on the back and a sug­
gestion, too. Their bridge-sing last Friday night was a real step in the 
right direction. After five months of virtual inactivity the council finally 
held an affair which gave not only a good time, but a chance for the mem­
bers of all the sororities to become better acquainted.
Unfortunately, the students of the Arts school and those of Mar­
garet Morrison, because of the nature of their work, seldom have the. op­
portunity to get to know each other. When the sororities went national 
last year, it became possible to rush girls in both schools. This helped the 
situation a little but only a little bit. For then only the girls within the 
same sorority knew each other, and an appreciable gap between the 
schools still existed. It was, finally, up to Pan Hellenic Council to ar­
range social functions whereby there would be attained a more friendly 
atmosphere. Their bridge-sing last week was just that.
Now that they have taken the first steps, we hope they stay on the 
right path. More bridge parties, more sings, and more parties.

Sixty-fourth Meeting 
February 7, 1945 
The meeting was called to order at 5:00 
p.m.
Present: Messrs. Daniels and Lerman; 
Misses Bauer, Brooks, Ferraez, Garland, 
and Swaney.
COMMITTEE REPORTS 
Elections Committee
Miss Garland announced that the re­
sults of the election held on February 7, 
1945, for an engineering representative 
are as follows:
August Binder ......................... 54
Richard Herrmann ................. 63
William Scherb ....................... 35
It was moved that Activities Council 
accept Miss Garland’s report and that 
Richard Herrmann be accepted as the 
Engineering Representative to fill the un­
expired term of office of Mr. Pollock.
Motion carried.
Special Committee—Activities Keys 
Miss Garland moved that the Activi­
ties Council approve W.A.A.’s petition for 
keys for the following members:
Frances Quill Gold—jewelled
Carol Ford Gold
Ruth Flanagan Gold
Clementine McKenna Gold 
Eileen Hilf Silver
Motion carried.
Activities Keys for the members of the 
Council were discussed. Miss Swaney 
moved that this discussion be tabled un­
til next week until further information 
can be obtained.
Motion carried.
Mr. Lerman moved that the co-chair­
man of the Council appoint a chairman 
to make an investigation regarding activi­
ties keys, and prepare a report for the 
next meeting „ with recommendations for 
the awarding of keys to the members of 
the Council and other student organiza­
tions with transient members.Motion carried.Miss Bauer appointed Miss Garland.
. . • Prof. Louis Squitieri
multitudes of students — sculpture 
majors, architects, Maggie Murphs, 
night students, and high school 
pupils. As a teacher he is capable 
and always anxious to be of help; 
yet his students are more likely to 
mention his skill as a craftsman 
and caster. In these fields they term 
him an expert. He also does a great 
deal of modelling and sculpturing, 
the results of which have been ex­
hibited in the Associated Artist’s 
shows for the last 8 or 9 years. In 
the 1937 show, one of his works, a 
statue called the Wrestlers was 
awarded the Pressly T. Craig Me­
morial Prize, a coveted honor.
However “Uncle Louie” is a man 
of many interests, hobbies, and 
skills. Top ranking among these is 
his gardening. As an enthusiastic 
follower of Burbank, he finds much 
pleasure in raising fruit trees and 
grafting them. Some day he hopes 
to have a good sized fruit farm 
where he can experiment to his 
heart’s content. Beside being an ex­
pert gardener, he is also a reputed 
wine-maker and his homemade 
wine is reported to be quite tasty. 
Another in the list of “Uncle 
Louie’s” interests (without it the list 
would be incomplete) is his family. 
He is father of 5 girls and one boy 
who have all attended Tech. His son, 
Louis, an Engineering graduate, is 
now a major in the army; and his 
youngest daughter, Eleanor, is a 
junior chemistry student in the 
school of engineering. Furthermore 
he is a grandfather of throe healthy 
grandsons; and last but not least, he 
is “Uncle Louie” to all his many 
students.

One of the Girls• . . On The Campus
We know her as a talented senior 
majoring in Industrial Design in the 
Painting and Design Department. 
We know her as president of Kappa 
Alpha Theta, as a member of Mortar 
Board, as secretary-treasurer of In- 
terhonorary Council, as layout edi­
tor of the Technical, and as one of 
the five Thistle queens of 1945. But 
above all, we know Peggy Cole as a
beautiful, charming, quiet-voiced, 
sincerely modest girl, as a wonder­
ful friend, as a person in a million, 
who is capable and dependable in 
everything she does, always willing 
to inconvenience herself to help 
anyone or any group, but never 
willing to talk or hear about herself 
or her achievements.
When Peggy came to Carnegie 
Tech as a P&D in the fall of ’41, it 
was after no hasty decision. She 
has been a painter ever since her 
kindergarten days; while she was at 
grade school, she decided that she 
wanted to go to art school some day. 
We are happy that she chose Tech.
We can discover something about 
her campus honors and activities 
prior to this year by looking through 
Tartans and Thistles. She was elect­
ed to Cwens, she was chosen as a 
member of the Spring Carnival 
Queen’s court during her sopho­
more year, she was one of the court

of the Junior Prom Queen last year 
and was a 1944 Thistle queen. When 
a freshman she joined Beta Tau 
Lambda, which under her leader­
ship (she was elected president in 
January 1944) became Gamma 
Theta chapter of Kappa Alpha 
Theta last April. Of course, she has 
enjoyed all campus social activities. 
Among the many gay events, the 
one she remembers best was Home­
coming Day in 1941 when Carnegie 
played Notre Dame and when she 
danced the night away at the Beta 
house. (Her special wish for Tech 
is that some day soon the Beanery 
will again be an integral part of 
campus life.)
Some of Peggy’s chief loves are 
classical music and Frank Sinatra, 
the painting of Gaugin and El 
Greco, psychological murder mys­
teries like Gaslight, George Sanders 
(who played the role of Gaugin in 
Moon and Sixpence), any well-writ­
ten book (for example, Pride and 
Prejudice), dancing and sewing, 
suits and blouses, shrimp and devil­
led crab.
When she graduates this spring 
she would like to spend two months 
doing nothing but eating, sleeping, 
and painting. Then she hopes to be­
gin her career as a designer in New 
York. No matter what type of work 
Peggy does, as long as it means cre­
ating beauty through her mind and 
hands, we know that, even when 
she is married and has a family, she 
will never be able to give it up al­
together. One of her fondest dreams 
is to travel through China, India, 
South America, and Egypt—and all 
places full of color, and atmosphere, 
and mystic weirdness. We can be 
sure that she will be painting all 
the time. And we who have known 
her at C. I. T. guarantee that as she 
is beloved and successful here, so 
will Peggy be always, anywhere.

freshmen, comes Tartan interviews. 
And where do we find the newest 
members of the Campus? Well, 
about noon one might find them 
gathered around “Ye Olde Lunche 
Table,” and so we did.
We cornered our victims after
they had completed their meal just 
to be certain that our queries and 
the flash of the camera would not 
frighten them, and anyhow who 
wants a picture of hungry fresh­
men?
Well, to go on, our first interview 
was with a nice tall “frosh,” Bill 
Spiece whbse hometown is Butler, 
Pa. Does he like Tech? “Natch!” 
“But,” says he, “it’s a lot different 
from high school.” We agreed. He 
also thinks the fellows here are 
grand but makes no comment, con­
structive or otherwise, when asked 
about the girls of the campus.
Bill Perry was next and for a 
while we thought perhaps we were 
in a rut because his home town is 
Butler, too. Bill is a Beta pledge and
is here at Tech on a Carnegie Schol­
arship. “Pittsburgh is a nice place 
to visit but not to live in” was his 
answer to, “What do you think of 
Pittsburgh?” He thinks the fellows 
and profs fine and the girls not bad.
But leave us not linger and so to 
our next interview, John Rose, an
aspiring engineer from Baltimore 
who is another member of the “I 
hate the Pittsburgh dirt” club. As 
for Tech it’s “fine” but we also ask­
ed him about the girls and his reply 
was “I want to meet them before I 
make a decision.” (A wise man).
Bill Hagel was the most amazing 
member of our elite group. Why 
amazing? Well, Bill graduated from 
Mercersburg Academy, a boys’ 
school, and so when he arrived at 
Tech he thought he had entered a 
girls’ school, but now he is ad­
justed and thinks there are “just 
plenty around.”
And so you have a few represen­
tative members of the new fresh­
man class. Our impression was that 
they were a little bewildered but 
“all reet.”

^ai&i in Khaki
Captain B. Roy Etrell, 1942 Car­
negie graduate, was awarded the 
Legion of Merit in a citation from 
Headquarters North African Thea­
ter of Operations. He was cited for 
exceptionally meritorious service 
during 1943 as Assistant Research
Director of the Engineer Training 
School. “His contribution to the war 
effort has been conspicuously above 
the usual.” His ingenuity, resource­
fulness, and leadership contributed 
to the design and manufacture of an 
important new practical device for 
clearing mine fields.
Etrell has been in the Corps of 
Engineers of the army since shortly 
after his graduation. For a short
while he was on the staff of the En­
gineers Training School. The Cap­
tain served at Engineer depots in 
Casablanca and other North African 
points for many months.
Gregory E. Mazza, 2nd Lt. in the 
15th AAF in Italy, was awarded the 
Air Medal “for meritorious achieve­
ment in aerial fight while participat­
ing in sustained operations against 
the enemy. His group has flown 
more than 160 combat missions and 
has twice received citations from 
the War Department. Mazza was a 
student at Carnegie before he enter­
ed the army in December, 1942.
News has just been received in 
this office that Pvt. Charles E. Fra- 
zee was awarded the Purple Heart 
posthumously. He was killed in ac­
tion at Metz, France on November 9,
1944. Pvt. Frazee studied at Carne­
gie Tech in the Army Specialized 
Training Program.

from the standpoint of the Tartans. 
Geneva poured on the heat in the 
opening minutes of the stanza, and 
for the only time in the whole game 
living up to expectations. Holding 
the Plaid to but one field goal until 
the last minute, Geneva still only 
outscored Carnegie by 19-12. Credit 
for keeping the scoring even goes 
to Ackerman, who dropped in six 
of his free throw shots. In the last 
few minutes, both sides substituted 
freely, since the outcome of the 
game was certain.
High scorer for the evening was 
Geneva’s Podbielski, who contribut­
ed fifteen points. Ackerman of Car­
negie stole the show with his per­
formance, scoring fourteen points in 
spite of not starting until the second 
quarter.

In the 7 o’clock preliminary game, 
the Delts and Betas battled evenly 
for the first three quarters, the 
Delts leading at that time by but 
one point. In the last period the 
Delts pulled through with a rally, 
and managed to pull out a 22-17 vic-

tory. If this game was indicative 
of intramural games to be played in 
the season about to start, the play­
ing will be particularly poor. Both 
teams played sloppy ball, and there 
is much room for improvement be­
fore the season starts.
A Tartan team, weakened by the 
loss of three of its first five men, was 
trammeled by the taller and heavier 
Lions of Penn State Wednesday, by 
a score of 57-22. Having lost once to 
Penn State earlier in the season on 
their own floor, and with the start­
ing lineup almost completely chang­
ed, Carnegie Tech was not figured to 
have much of a chance.
The game was played entirely ac­
cording to form. The Lions opened 
with a heavy barrage of baskets, 
and by controlling the backboards 
were able to shoots almost at will. 
Never in any serious trouble, Penn 
State freely substituted its reserves 
in order to give them practice. Al­
together, Penn State used fourteen 
men, while Carnegie Tech used ten 
men.
Individual scoring was not the 
standout feature of this game. High 
man for Penn State was Boziriski 
with ten points, and for the Plaid, 
Tasso katselas dropped in seven 
points.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1945THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
Message to Engineers
I deeply appreciate your support 
in the election of last Wednesday, 
and I wish at this time to extend a 
personal invitation to all of you to 
talk things over with me, so that I 
may truly be your representative on 
the student government. I know 
that many of you have already ex­
pressed certain ideas. Many more 
opinions are welcome. And inci­
dentally, please don’t suggest to me 
again that a bar be set up in the old 
foundry because I’m sure the school 
officials would not approve.
I would like to say a few words to 
the freshmen. ACAC is the name of 
the present student government of 
Carnegie Tech. In addition to the 
athletic and publications depart­
ments, all of the colleges are rep­
resented on ACAC. It has the pow­
er to supervise school activities.
All of us find it easy to criticize 
other peoples’ short comings. It is 
far more difficult, however, to act­
ually attempt to rectify any such 
situations. We might apply this 
principle to the present situation at 
Carnegie Tech. Almost everyone is 
ready to say that Tech in wartime 
is nothing like Tech in peace­
time. But one hardly ever hears of 
someone doing something to im­
prove the state of affairs.
As most of you are men, I shall 
speak to you as men. (No offense is 
meant, Audrey.) The success of any 
social function at Tech is propor­
tional to the number of men attend­
ing, for men still have to make the 
dates. (At least I’m told so.) Many 
of you fellows have been falling 
down on the job. The girls then lose 
interest, and soon social affairs are 
in a state of stagnation.
I am asking you now to do a favor 
for me in order to improve the pres­
ent situation. I am asking that 
everyone of you who is able, to at­
tend the big party sponsored by 
ACAC on Saturday, February 24th. 
Admission is free, and everything

The party is to be held in Thistle

come down and join in the fun. So,

about your slide rules for just one 
evening?
Sincerely,

8THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1945The Plaid
Post-Valentine Party to Be 
Held At Canteen Feb. 24
Dancing, Refreshments 
And Games 8:30-11:30
February 24 has been selected as 
the date for the next social event to 
be held by the Evening Student 
Council. This is to be known as the 
Valentine Party, a function in nor­
mal times usually held in the early 
part of February, but because of the 
present emergency, schedules,. etc., 
it is necessary to hold the party on 
the evening of February 24.
The Canteen, located on the Car­
negie Tech Campus, is to be the 
scene of the party. This is the first 
time this Canteen is to be used by 
the evening group for its function 
and it should prove an innovation. 
The Canteen is the building for­
merly used as the Hut (campus 
library) and is the low frame build­
ing located in the “Cut” area of the 
campus.
The social committee, headed by 
Arlene McMurray, has planned a 
real program which is designed to 
promote good fellowship among the 
evening groups. Dancing, games, 
and refreshments are the order of 
the evening and all are assured of 
an enjoyable evening.
All evening students are welcom­
ed to attend this party. There is to 
be no admission charge, the stu­
dents Ibeing the guests of the Even­
ing Student Council.
Final Plans Shaping Up 
For Engineer’s Banquet
Well fellows, the Engineer’s ban­
quet news for this week concerns 
the change of the banquet date.
The affair has been changed from 
April 7 to March 31, 1945. And is to 
be held in the Roosevelt Hotel Gold 
Room.
The committee in charge of the 
banquet proposes to have a very 
interesting speaker and will make 
an announcement in the near future 
concerning the speaker and fellows, 
if you’ve been to any of the Engi­
neer’s banquets you know that the 
speaker has always been one of the 
highlights of the evening, and they 
intend to make this banquet no ex­
ception.
And another thing to remember 
is that the shows at the banquet 
have always been the tops and Lan- 
agan’s Theatrical Agency have a 
swell lineup of talent for this ban­
quet.
So fellows, now is the time to 
lineup your friends and plan to at­
tend the Thirtieth Annual Engi­
neer’s Banquet.

The regular meeting of Evening 
Student Council was called to order 
at 3:05, Sunday, February 4. Dr. 
Jones, Mr. Miller, and Major Stan­
ton were guests.
President Biscup reported on the 
activities of Council. The general 
activity is to promote class repre­
sentation on Council, and it is hoped 
that this plan will be inaugurated 
this fall.
Harold Park reported on the ac­
tivities of Sigma Delta Phi, and 
Steve Marcinizyn reported on the 
activities of Nu Sigma Alpha.
Major Stanton spoke briefly on 
the enrollment and thinks that reg­
istration in the not too distant fu­
ture will be very good. Dr. Jones 
agreed with him and also spoke on 
the Endowment Fund. He is very 
optimistic as to the outcome of plans 
for increasing this fund.
The third guest, Mr. Miller, told 
of the plans for post-war building* 
which include a general activities 
union.
There was a short recess during 
which tea and cakes were- served. - 
The meeting adjourned at 6:05.
Social Calendar Changes
The Social Committee announces 
the following changes in the social 
activities calendar. The St. Valen­
tine party originally scheduled for 
February 10 will now be held Feb­
ruary 24, in the Canteen across 
from the Fine Arts Building. March
17 is the final date set for the Swim­
ming Party in the Gymnasium 
Building. Although the St. Patrick’s 
Day Dance has been cancelled, an­
other event may replace it in April. 
And last but never least, the An­
nual Engineer’s Stab Banquet will 
remain at the original date, March 
31. The spot will be announced later.
