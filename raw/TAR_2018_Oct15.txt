Jahanian on CMU’s role in the world and in students’ lives
ZACHARY GOLDSTEIN
Staffwriter
In anticipation of his 
upcoming inauguration, 
The Tartan sat down with 
President Farnam Jahanian 
to hear his thoughts on 
the key challenges facing 
Carnegie Mellon University 
students. Below is a tran-
script of the conversation, 
lightly edited for clarity and 
length.
The Tartan: Could you 
talk about what your vision 
for the university is and 
what you want it to become 
over the next few years?
President Jahanian: 
Absolutely. This is truly an 
extraordinary time in the 
life of Carnegie Mellon. 
We're at the center of a 
societal and economic 
transformation that is cata-
lyzed by digitization of in-
formation, unprecedented 
access to data, automation, 
and arti?cial intelligence. 
And the acceleration in the 
scale, scope, and ubiquity 
of these advances in tech-
nology are unprecedented. 
These advances of course 
are transforming every sec-
tor of our economy, from 
healthcare to transporta-
tion to ?nance to energy, 
not to mention education. 
And as these transforma-
tions are taking place, I look 
at Carnegie Mellon and the 
future of Carnegie Mellon, 
and if we don't do anything 
differently, we're going to 
continue to be a great in-
stitution. But if we are very 
intentional, and unapolo-
getically bold as I say, about 
the role of Carnegie Mellon 
in shaping the next cen-
tury, there are tremendous 
opportunities for Carnegie 
Mellon in leading education 
and research in the world, 
and that is my vision for 
Carnegie Mellon.
Now what's remarkable 
about Carnegie Mellon, is 
that we work at what I refer 
to as this nexus of technol-
ogy and society. And the 
work that we do, all the way 
from wonderful research 
and education from engi-
neering [and] computer sci-
ence, to social science and 
humanities and the arts and 
the business school and so 
on, somehow connects this 
nexus of technology and 
society. What I think is most 
compelling about Carnegie 
Mellon University is the way 
we intertwine engineering, 
and technology and scienc-
es, with business, policy, the 
arts and humanities. There 
are very few institutions 
in the world who are able 
to actually intertwine and 
connect these disciplines so 
seamlessly.
So where do I see the 
university going? I hope that 
in the coming years, we will 
be seen as the place known 
for advancing human 
knowledge, improving 
[the] human condition, and 
solving complex problems 
for society that require in-
terdisciplinary skills. We're 
also known for inventing 
the future where we have 
broad impacts on society. 
And probably the most im-
portant part of our mission 
is preparing a new genera-
tion of leaders who imagine 
broadly, think critically, and 
work collaboratively. Step-
ping back, I see really two 
missions [for] the univer-
sity: we have a research mis-
sion and an education mis-
sion, and these two missions 
are so deeply integrated and 
tied together.
The Tartan: Another 
topic I want to talk about is 
preparing students for the 
workforce.
President Jahanian: Oh, 
I love that topic!
The Tartan: In particu-
lar, I think that there's no 
doubt that Carnegie Mellon 
students will graduate with 
incredible technical skills 
and other kinds of skills 
and will be able to succeed 
in that sense, but one thing 
I'm more concerned about 
is whether Carnegie Mellon 
students are prepared to 
handle the ethical chal-
lenges of the workplace. I'll 
bring up a couple examples. 
A lot of tech companies that 
Carnegie Mellon students 
tend to go on to work at 
have a lot of controversies 
that they are coming under 
?re for. So there's issues of 
censorship, of whether these 
companies are monopolies, 
there's the extreme example 
of whether Facebook was 
contributing to ethnic 
cleansing in Myanmar, and 
there's all sorts of reasons 
to question whether these 
companies are forces for 
good. My question for you 
is: do you think Carnegie 
Mellon University prepares 
students for the ethical chal-
lenges that they're going to 
face in the workplace? And 
do you feel that it has an 
obligation to do so?
President Jahanian: I 
think ethics and integrity, 
to be candid, are central, 
indispensable, and de?ning 
attributes of higher educa-
tion institutions. There's no 
question that we give a great 
education to our students, 
regardless of their disciplin-
ary interest. So I think it's an 
enormous responsibility for 
the university to make sure 
that not only we give stu-
dents disciplinary expertise, 
but we develop the whole 
person. And developing the 
whole person means giving 
them the skills that go be-
yond disciplinary expertise, 
including communication 
skills, collaboration skills, 
skills that allow them to be 
great citizens. So ethics is 
an important component of 
that.
Performance art asks students to visualize their workload

On Friday, Oct. 5, 
students exited class to 
find a strange sight on The 
Cut: a group of figures, 
cloaked in white hazmat 
suits, standing across from 
The Fence. As students 
drew closer they could see 
blue paint splattered over 
each of the figures. There 
were five of them, and 
they were not sculptures 
but people, students who 
the viewers might recog-
nize. They were standing 
motionless with their eyes 
closed and hands at their 
side. Suddenly, it became 
clear to onlookers: this is 
performance art.
It was a human Likert 
scale. A large sign stood ad-
jacent to the performances, 
held up by two large paint 
cans, and instructed view-
ers to apply paint to the 
person who best repre-
sents their stance on the 
following statement: 
“Carnegie Mellon creates 
a manageable workload 
for its students.” In front of 
each performer lay a sign, 
a can of blue paint, and a 
few brushes. In all caps, 
the signs read Strongly 
Agree, Agree, Neutral, Dis-
agree, and Strongly Dis-
agree.
A blue frown emoticon 
was painted across the per-
former for Disagree. Blue 
hearts were painted on 
the chests of the perform-
ers for both Strongly Agree 
and Strongly Disagree.
As classes got out at 
11:50 a.m. a mass of stu-
dents flooded The Cut, 
and many walked over to 
see what was going on. A 
crowd formed. Many stu-
dents understood this as a 
criticism of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s rigor, and the lack 
of discourse surrounding 
it. Others did not think it 
addressed Carnegie Mel-
lon’s workload well. Some 
weren't sure it was art, and 
many walked right on by.
Quan Wyndeer, a 
sophomore acting major, 
was surprised to see that 
anyone had painted on 
the section for Strongly 
Agree. “I think that a lot 
of people struggle with 
workload but don't really 
know how to bring it up…” 
Matthew Kirshner, also a 
sophomore acting major, 
chimed in, “and they feel 
a responsibility to just shut 
up and deal with it.” Wyn-
deer continued, “if you 
say something about it, 
you might be perceived as 
weak.”
Jessa Westheimer, the 
artist, calls the artwork 
“Human Likert: A Man-
ageable Workload.” She 
explained that in the pre-
ceding week she was work-
ing constantly and hadn’t 
slept more than two hours 
a night, “and I wasn't even 
the busiest person I know.” 
Through this performance, 
she sought to “just make 
it very obvious what ev-
eryone was thinking,” and 
show students that they 
are not alone in struggling 
with the workload here.
A group of three 
students stood near the 
Agree performer, dis-
cussing the work’s flaws 
as a data visualization. 
“There’s no set amount 
of paint that people can 
use, [so] you can't re-
ally tell how many people 
painted on each person,” 
Yael Canoan, a first-year 
architecture student, com-
mented. Perry Nasech, a 
first year in the school of 
art, also mentioned that 
people probably weren't 
concerned with how much 
paint they were applying.
“Human Likert: A 
Manageable Workload” 
successfully captured the 
attention of many stu-
dents, despite some of 
their criticisms. Emily 
Schneider, a sophomore 
biochem major, said “I 
came out of Doherty and 
immediately saw this and 
was like ‘What's going on, 
I need to investigate.’” She 
thought the work was in-
teresting and found the 
message clear. Yugyeong 
Lee, a senior architecture 
student, said that “it made 
me want to participate be-
cause it's different from 
other surveys they do at 
school.”
After around 45 
minutes, the performers 
took a short break, open-
ing their eyes and chatting 
with one another. For the 
first session, they had been 
instructed to “Stand here, 
eyes closed, no talking, no 
moving.” For the second 
session they could be more 
relaxed, and stood with 
their eyes open, occasion-
ally talking to the view-
ers. One of the perform-
ers, Kendra Adegbesan, a 
sophomore neurobiology 
major, said that she liked 
overhearing discussions: 
“I feel like when our eyes 
were closed they didn't 
think we were people, so 
they would talk very open-
ly, saying ‘YEAH I REALLY 
DISAGREE I HATE THIS 
SCHOOL!’” She continued, 
“I've had a lot of people 
paint aggressively on me 
today.”
Ashley Burbano, the 
performer for Agree, criti-
cized how students often 
complain about the work-
load without addressing 
it. “I feel like on college 
campuses you have to be 
sort of self-advocating to 
get what you want, or else 
nothing will change.”
Not all, however, felt 
that the performance 
had to be used solely to  
solumnly contemplate 
the workload at Carnegie 
Mellon. Jin Lee, a senior 
statistics major, was excited 
by the opportunity to paint 
all over his friend, even 
though she represented the 
opinion he disagreed with. 
Jin exuberantly picked up 
a brush and painted a blue 
arrow over the forehead 
of the actor for Strongly 
Agree, referencing Aang 
from Avatar the Last 
Airbender. As Lee said, “I 
figured that since every-
one else has been drawn on 
more, it's fine, figuratively 
speaking.”

A group of students, led by Jessa Westheimer, performed the piece “Live Likert: A Manageable Workload” at The Fence on Friday, Oct. 5, asking students to paint on the student that best represented their experience.

You mentioned ethics 
but the examples you gave 
also involve privacy, so let 
me tie that back to technol-
ogy. I think that this is one 
of the issues that we face. 
As we see society develop, 
as we see these advances 
in technology that are 
becoming so pervasive and 
impacting every aspect 
of our lives, what we're 
also seeing is that the po-
tential impact of technol-
ogy could be negative. So 
there are ethical, privacy, 
and policy ramifications of 
technology that have to be 
considered. So preparing 
our students not only to be 
inventors, but also be able 
to address the policy and 
ethical and other implica-
tions of what we invent is 
extremely important, and 
that has to be part of the 
education.
We have a number of 
courses on campus that 
address this, and there's 
an undergraduate major in 
Ethics, History, and Public 
Policy which is an inter-
departmental program 
offered through history 
and philosophy.
The Tartan: I know 
that the courses exist, the 
research is happening, 
the major exists, but I feel 
like the issue there is that 
if you're someone who is 
going to choose to take 
these courses, you might 
already not be the person 
who needs it the most, and 
I'm wondering how a typi-
cal Carnegie Mellon stu-
dent who isn't especially 
concerned or aware of 
these issues is going to be 
prepared for these ethical 
challenges.
President Jahanian: 
We also ask all of our stu-
dents to commit to a set of 
standards to be a member 
of our community, and 
that happens in your fresh-
man year in orientation. 
When you start here, we 
say that we have a set of 
community standards that 
we expect our students to 
live by. But you're actually 
highlighting something 
that's really important. 
The question is, in addi-
tion to the courses that 
are available that the stu-
dents can take, can we 
integrate components of 
ethics and related topics 
into other courses that 
students take for their 
major? And the answer 
is absolutely yes and we 
should be doing more of 
that, there's no question 
in my mind. I would actu-
ally say that when I talk 
about collaboration skills 
or communication skills, 
these are the skills that we 
need to integrate deeply 
into our curriculum, not 
just as separate courses 
that students can have 
access to, but we should 
think of these as compo-
nents of courses that are 
integrated into some of 
the major courses that stu-
dents take as part of their 
education.
The Tartan: You may be 
aware that at the Technical 
Opportunities Conference, 
there were protests about 
the defense contractors 
that were recruiting there, 
and a group called the 
Students for a Democratic 
Society were trying to do 
these demonstrations to 
discourage students from 
applying to these compa-
nies, and they don't like 
that these companies, 
which they view as being 
forces for evil in the world, 
are recruiting at Carnegie 
Mellon.
President Jahanian: 
First of all, Carnegie 
Mellon has always sup-
ported students' decisions 
to add their voices to any 
debate. We seek, we value, 
cultivate, and support stu-
dents who want to make 
a positive impact on so-
ciety and participate in 
civil discourse. So the fact 
that there are students on 
campus who feel strongly 
about this, I think it's im-
portant for their voice to 
be heard, and it's impor-
tant for them to have the 
opportunity to express 
their opinion. Free speech 
is so core to the foundation 
of our democracy.
Having said that, we 
should respect the fact 
that students who gradu-
ate from here have the 
choice of taking positions 
in companies that they 
find exciting, and we need 
to respect their decision, 
we need to respect their 
desires, and as long as we 
nurture and support civil 
discourse on our campus, 
and support individu-
als' rights to express their 
opinions in a positive, con-
structive way, I think we're 
going to end up in a better 
place. That's really how I 
feel about this.
I think your question 
was also getting at the is-
sue of defense contracting. 
I don't want to sidestep 
that, I'm happy to address 
that. An important core 
value and philosophy of 
higher education in this 
country and for Carnegie 
Mellon is academic 
freedom. Faculty and stu-
dents have the choice to 
decide whether they want 
to do research and work in 
areas that are of interest to 
the Department of Defense 
or the defense industry. 
We need to respect their 
decision, and support their 
academic freedom. That's 
really my position on that. 
I hope that's clear.
The Tartan: That's 
clear. I understand your 
stance on the freedom as-
pect of this, but even if you 
have a totally open view 
that on its face doesn't 
favor one type of com-
pany over another, that 
just through the finances 
of it, that leads to cer-
tain biases. So you might 
say that Carnegie Mellon 
University has no policy 
that favors whether a 
technology for social good 
company is recruiting ver-
sus a defense contractor. 
But the fact is that which 
companies can afford to 
reserve a spot at the TOC 
or can afford to spare staff 
members to go recruit 
at the front of Gates and 
greet students and give out 
free food there, there are 
going to be certain biases 
there. Do you worry about 
that?
President Jahanian: 
What I worry about is 
to ensure that compa-
nies have access to our 
students, and I want to 
make sure that companies 
whether they are small, 
medium, or large, and re-
gardless of what sector of 
the economy they oper-
ate in, that they have ac-
cess to our students and 
provide opportunities for 
our students. I think that's 
extremely important. In 
ways that we can facilitate 
that, we will do everything 
that we can at Carnegie 
Mellon whether through 
our colleges or central re-
cruiting, to make sure that 
happens.
Beyond that, I don't 
think that we want to be 
in a position of dictating 
what companies should 
or should not recruit on 
campus. I think it's really 
important for students 
to be able to add their 
voice to any kind of dis-
cussion or debate around 
this topic, and we should 
support that without any 
question, but at the same 
time, we need to create 
an environment such that 
various companies have 
the ability to come and 
recruit our students. And 
that our students have 
the opportunity to look 
at various companies and 
various opportunities.
And we have a terrific 
set of programs in our 
Heinz College School of 
Public Policy as well as in 
our Engineering and Public 
Policy program that focus 
on policy-related issues. 
That actually happens in 
Dietrich and in our busi-
ness school as well. When 
it comes to that, we have a 
large number of students 
who actually want to work 
in the public sector, and 
they want to work in non-
profit environments. The 
question is: how can we 
facilitate that? How can 
we support that? So let me 
give you an example.
Richard Scheines, 
our Dean of the Dietrich 
College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences, was 
experimenting with an in-
ternship program this last 
year which I think has been 
quite successful. I think it's 
really important to high-
light this. We know that 
many of our students who 
are studying in certain ar-
eas having to do with sci-
ence, engineering, tech-
nology, and business and 
so on may have an easier 
time getting paid intern-
ships by companies that 
are recruiting on campus. 
On the other hand, we 
have a lot of students on 
campus who may actu-
ally be studying technical 
areas or maybe students 
in the social science and 
humanities college, or our 
college of fine arts, or our 
engineering college or our 
science college who want 
to go work for a non-prof-
it, or who want to work for 
an enterprise that doesn't 
necessarily have the ca-
pacity to support them. 
It might be a non-profit 
or a startup that's doing 
something socially valu-
able, and is of interest to 
students. 
Our Dietrich colleagues 
came up with the idea of 
supporting students during 
a summer, so they can go 
and work in non-profit and 
other entities that poten-
tially nurture their interest 
and support them. We've 
started experimenting with 
it this past semester, and 
it's been enormously suc-
cessful, so that's the kind 
of stuff that we do to cre-
ate more opportunities for 
students.
Studies have shown that 
having an internship is one 
of the most important fac-
tors for students getting 
jobs after graduation. So 
to the extent that we can 
facilitate that for students 
who want to go work for 
a non-profit enterprise or 
be involved in community 
service, I think that's a 
healthy thing for the uni-
versity and our students.
The Tartan: When I was 
asking people what they 
want me to ask you about, 
something that came up 
a lot was the question of 
stress culture and mental 
health issues. I talked to 
someone who said that 
when Carnegie Mellon is 
talking about what it's go-
ing to do to address these 
issues, a lot of the time it's 
focused on something like 
hiring more therapists or 
expanding access to mental 
health resources, but fewer 
efforts to address the root 
cause and make Carnegie 
Mellon a healthier and less 
stressful place. But obvi-
ously there's a tradeoff 
there because we still want 
to maintain academic rigor. 
So how do you think about 
that?
President Jahanian: 
As you know, we launched 
a task force on the CMU 
experience almost three 
years ago. That task force 
was motivated by the 
observation that we know 
that we offer our students 
a great education, but we 
also have the responsibil-
ity of developing the whole 
person. What that means is 
offering them opportuni-
ties outside the classroom 
as part of their education.
There is no question that 
Carnegie Mellon as one 
of the top schools in the 
country is an academically 
rigorous environment. And 
I admit that our expecta-
tion of excellence leads to 
amazing things that come 
out of this campus, [such 
as] students that educate 
and research. But some-
times [this] also fosters a 
culture of stress among our 
students and faculty. And 
you have to be very vigilant 
about it. You have to tackle 
the problem constantly 
and part of the reason we 
launched the Task Force on 
the CMU Experience was 
really to look at the stress 
culture on the campus and 
find ways that we can miti-
gate that issue. In fact, over 
the past 2-3 years, and as 
you can see we post on the 
website all the things that 
we do as part of the task 
force, not only have we 
doubled our resources for 
mental health and for stu-
dent advising, but we also 
started investing in vari-
ous services on campus to 
support our students.
While you may not 
make a direct link between 
the investment we make 
on campus, many of our 
students have been asking 
for collaboration spaces, 
they want space on campus 
where they can essentially 
study with their friends. So 
what we did with the Wean 
library. Every new build-
ing that we are building 
has collaboration spaces 
and study spaces as you 
see in the Tepper Quad. 
But fundamentally it's also 
about connecting the ad-
vising that we do academi-
cally to mental health and 
the support that we provide 
our students.
So we're investing 
heavily in this. Part of it 
is also getting our more 
senior students to be men-
tors for our freshman and 
sophomore students. The 
stress culture is reinforced 
by the experiences that 
one may have on campus. 
So it's really important 
not only to have advisors 
and counselors and teach-
ers to talk to our students 
about us, but to also rely 
on our juniors and seniors 
to provide mentorship and 
support for our students, 
that they don't need to add 
unnecessary pressure on 
themselves.
I must tell you, we had 
24,000 applications to our 
freshman class this year. 
There was a 19 percent 
increase in our applica-
tions this year over last 
year. So more and more 
students want to come to 
Carnegie Mellon. Some-
thing quite exciting is hap-
pening on this campus. 
And people outside are 
recognizing that we offer 
great education, we offer 
a great environment for 
students. Which means we 
are a very selective place. 
Some of the most gifted, 
brightest students in the 
world come to our campus 
to study. So what we need 
to do is to remind them 
that they are also, every 
student that comes in, why 
they may have come from 
the top 10% of their high 
school, they're surrounded 
by very bright students 
on this campus. It's a very 
competitive place to get to 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, but at the same time, 
Carnegie Mellon is a very 
nurturing place, the stu-
dents tend to be very sup-
portive of each other, and 
it's a very collegial place. 
So we need to constant-
ly remind ourselves and 
reinforce that culture.

On Thursday night, a 
panel of Carnegie Mellon 
professors and alumni 
gathered before an audi-
ence of 30 people in Baker 
Hall’s Adamson wing to 
speak about the num-
ber one most widely-read 
book in English-speaking 
educational institutions: 
Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein. 
The event, titled Franken-
stein@200, is a celebration 
of the book’s bicentennial 
anniversary, and this year’s 
installment of the Carol 
Brown Lecture Series.
The Carol Brown Series 
is a series of annual lec-
tures endowed by its name-
sake, the former CEO of 
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust 
and a Life Emeritus mem-
ber of Carnegie Mellon's 
Board of Trustees. “The 
focus of these lectures,” 
said associate professor of 
English Richard Purcell, 
who organized the panel, 
“is on getting undergradu-
ate students excited about 
studying English.”
Undergraduate English 
is a small world at Carnegie 
Mellon, comprising just ?ve 
percent of all the students 
in Dietrich college. At a 
school well-known for its 
technical opportunities, it 
can be hard to attract stu-
dents to literary programs. 
Of the 30 audience mem-
bers, only 12 were under-
grads. The panel was select-
ed to touch a broad range of 
topics, extending beyond 
the traditional realm of 
English.
“The novel ties into so 
many ?elds and interests 
beyond literature,” Dr. 
Purcell said. “I thought it 
would be a good idea to 
bring people from diverse 
disciplines and ?elds here.”
Of the four panelists, 
two were English profes-
sors. Dr. Marian Aguiar, 
whose research is focused 
on culture and globaliza-
tion, presented a recent 
modern adaption of the 
story, in which she spoke 
about themes of waste, 
recycling, and material by-
products of globalization, 
and how the body of Fran-
kenstein’s monster is a met-
aphor for these themes. Dr. 
Jon Klancher, also from the 
English department, spoke 
about the original Franken-
stein texts – there were four 
editions of the book dur-
ing Shelley’s lifetime, each 
slightly different from the 
next. He then focused on 
the engravings and images 
that accompanied each edi-
tion, drawing connections 
to the political climate of 
19th-century Europe.
The other two panelists 
gave very different reads. 
Carnegie Mellon alumna 
Tami Dixon, co-founder and 
principal creative at Brico-
lage Production company, 
spoke about her experi-
ence adapting the story for 
a November radio perfor-
mance: Midnight Radio’s 
Frankenstein. She spoke 
about upended expecta-
tions, having never read the 
original book until starting 
the project, and how ?awed 
the characters are: “Ac-
tors dream of sinking their 
teeth into a role like this,” 
she said, speaking about 
Dr. Frankenstein himself. 
Also presenting was robot-
ics professor Dr. Illah Nour-
bakhsh, whose work most 
closely mimics that of the 
novel’s wayward protago-
nist. In his talk he brought 
up ethical issues within ro-
botics, arti?cial intelligence 
(AI), and uncertainty.
The subject of uncer-
tainty (and its opposite – 
predictability) was brought 
up again during questions. 
Mediator Wendy Arons, a 
professor at the School of 
Drama, pointed out that 
there is always an element 
of uncertainty in the effect 
a creative work can have on 
the world.
Uncertainty is a hot 
topic at Carnegie Mellon – 
there are numerous courses 
across campus devoted to 
understanding it. For many 
technologists, Dr. Nour-
bakhsh pointed out, uncer-
tainty is a bad thing: “What 
if one day, your toaster 
decides it doesn’t want to 
toast your bread this morn-
ing?” For artists such as 
Ms. Dixon, however, it’s 
what gives her work: “The 
search for predictability is 
terrifying to me,” she said.
The dialogue, and the 
different points of view, all 
contributed to a broader 
understanding of the old 
book. These panelists, had 
they all gone to undergrad 
at Carnegie Mellon, may 
never have crossed paths. 
By bringing them together, 
the event was supposed to 
have appealed to a larger 
group of students. With 
a sparse undergraduate 
showing, however, the 
panel fell short of this goal.

Bette Midler shares myopic take on feminism
Amidst the anger, outcry, 
and protest leading up to Brett 
Kavanaugh’s con?rmation to the 
United States Supreme Court, 
acclaimed actress and singer Bette 
Midler sent out a tweet quoting 
a controversial lyric from a John 
Lennon and Yoko Ono song. That 
tweet and a follow-up defending 
and attempting to explain her 
initial tweet, both of which have 
since been deleted, were met 
with intense backlash and led to 
a conversation on a continuing 
issue about the intersection of 
gender, race, and advocacy.
“‘Women, are the n-word of the 
world,’” Midler tweeted. “Raped, 
beaten, enslaved, married off, 
worked like dumb animals; denied 
education and inheritance; 
enduring the pain and danger of 
childbirth and life IN SILENCE for 
THOUSANDS of years[.]”
Criticism came immediately 
from The Atlantic reporter Jemele 
Hill and other Twitter users who 
responded that Midler had no 
right to use the offensive word.
Midler later apologized for her 
words, writing, “Angrily I tweeted 
w/o thinking my choice of words 
would be enraging to black 
women who doubly suffer, both by 
being women and by being black. 
I am an ally and stand with you; 
always have. And I apologize.”
But Midler’s comments point 
to a greater issue. Other than her 
use of the racial slur, she wrote 
of the af?ictions of women: of 
rape, violence, forced marriages, 
servitude, and lack of opportunity. 
While all these are true, we must 
consider the context in which 
she wrote them. Admittedly, she 
wrote in anger in the midst of 
Kavanaugh’s nomination and 
impending con?rmation. She 
wrote them about how women’s 
experiences are disregarded, but 
she also wrote without thinking 
about how her words would be 
viewed by women of color. She 
wrote from the perspective of 
white feminism.
White feminism is a dif?cult 
concept to describe. It isn’t 
singularly de?ned or ?nite. It 
is a continuous and constantly 
changing idea about gender and 
race. It encompasses the idea that 
white women do not and cannot 
have the sexist experiences of 
women of color, and do not 
consider that these differences 
exist. A white woman is a white 
feminist if she does not believe or 
understand her privilege.
There are many signs indicating 
a white feminist, but the greatest 
may be a white woman who does 
not understand that she, like 
all white people, bene?t from a 
white-led society. White feminists 
are those so privileged that they 
are able to ignore systematic 
racism, bigotry, — and yes, some 
types of sexism — just because it 
does not apply to them.
The idea of white 
privilege makes white people 
uncomfortable; even for people 
who are advocates for equality, 
diversity, and representation, 
the idea of one’s own privilege is 
daunting, but it is so ingrained in 
society that it cannot be ignored.
Why has this become a 
conversation about race? Some 
may question why everything has 
to be about race or why we can’t 
just talk about sexism. But that’s 
the problem. Oppression and 
marginalization is intersectional. 
Race and gender — as well as class, 
nationality, disability, age, and 
sexuality — are interconnected 
and interdependent. You 
cannot talk about one without 
considering the other. White 
women will never understand 
the struggles of being a woman of 
color, but they can be an ally, they 
can give women of color a seat 
at the table that their privilege 
inherently provides. They can 
help women of color have a voice 
in these conversations.
To have this discourse, 
however, we must think before 
we speak and not spew our words 
in anger. Twitter, social media 
platforms, and the internet itself 
have given us avenues to do this 
like never before. It has given 
the voiceless voices, but it has 
also given people the liberty to 
say whatever they see ?t. Unlike 
Midler, most Twitter users are 
not high-pro?le celebrities. Most 
will not be criticized for tone-
deaf comments or white feminist 
tweets.
Most of the time, we don’t really 
consider the impact of our words, 
and what they mean to people 
who we don’t directly interact 
with, but we should. Midler’s 
apology acknowledges this and 
the implication of her words. 
Hopefully, she will learn from this. 
Hopefully, we will learn from this. 
The only way to combat sexism 
and racism and all intersectional 
systems of marginalization is to 
do it together. We as a society can 
do better.
#MeToo reaches women in India
LIKHITHA CHINTAREDDY
Junior Staffwriter
One year after the movement 
started in America, following 
the revelations of sexual assault 
by Harvey Weinstein published 
in The New Yorker, #MeToo has 
?nally arrived in India.
It started in Bollywood, one of 
the biggest ?lm industries in the 
world, with actress Tanushree 
Dutta accusing fellow actor-
activist Nana Patekar of sexual 
harassment on the sets of a ?lm 
they were co-starring in in 2009. 
On Oct. 4, writer Mahima Kukreja 
tweeted that popular standup 
comedian Utsav Chakraborty had 
sent her unsolicited photos of his 
private parts.
Then the dam burst open 
with female journalists leading 
the way. Several male journalists 
and popular editors were named 
and shamed. Journalists Ghazala 
Wahab, Shutapa Paul, and CNN 
scribe Majlie de Puy Camp have 
accused MJ Akbar, the current 
Minister of State External Affairs 
of the Indian Government 
of sexual harassment and 
molestation during his time 
as the editor of some national 
newspapers.
Directors and actors were 
revealed to have been seeking 
sexual favors and harassing 
actresses and their other female 
coworkers on set. Chetan Bhagat, 
one of the most popular authors 
of ?ction novels in India, was 
also accused of harassing a 
female journalist who’d once 
interviewed him. Women in the 
music industry too came out with 
their stories of harassment.
Throughout the last month, 
as #MeToo gained more 
momentum, the movement 
remained free of political 
involvement, with no major 
political party coming up to try to 
claim the movement. And that is 
the uniqueness of the movement 
as it takes place in India. Women 
like journalist Sandhya Menon, 
social news writer Sonia Mariam 
Thomas, and popular singer 
Chinmayee Sripada, have led the 
movement, calling out men in 
their respective professions for 
harassing women and tweeting 
the DMs that they receive from 
women who wish to share their 
experiences anonymously. In this 
way, #MeToo has become the very 
symbol of sisterhood, the age-old 
culture of women supporting and 
helping each other in times of 
dif?culty.
And these are dif?cult times. 
The #MeToo movement has 
irrevocably changed the very 
cultural, socioeconomic and 
political structures of India, 
challenging the hierarchies that 
shield men of power from justice.
It is the culmination of all the 
events of violence against women, 
a number that has increased 
since the horri?c gang rape of 
Nirbhaya in 2012, following the 
broken promise of the current 
government of safety for women, 
one of the reasons why they’d 
come to power in 2014; the horri?c 
rape and murder of an eight-year-
old child in Kathua, politicized to 
the anger and frustration of the 
people, the Unnao rape victim’s 
father’s murder by the goons of a 
politician belonging to the same 
party as the one she’d accused 
of raping her, and the numerous 
victims of acid-attacks by men 
whose advances they’d spurned.
This is an expression of rage 
and frustration of women in 
India, but there are other classes 
of women in India who #MeToo 
cannot provide a platform to speak 
up for: women belonging to the 
lower end of the socioeconomic 
spectrum have access to neither 
the technology nor the power, to 
speak up. Especially for women 
who were forced into the Jogini or 
Devadasi system, in which girls as 
young as 7 are “dedicated” to the 
god and then are raped by men 
of power in the village or locality. 
The Devadasi practice had been 
outlawed in India in 1988 but 
still continues to illegally exist in 
several pockets of the country. 
Women belonging to “lower” 
castes in India and Dalit women 
also face violence — physical, 
sexual, verbal — meted upon 
them by upper caste men or 
by men belonging to their own 
caste. Girls are also forced into 
the Human Traf?cking market 
for sexual exploitation or bonded 
labor, which, although illegal, 
continues to be a signi?cant 
problem.
These women have 
internalized this violence, 
accepted it as their fate. They 
do not have access to better 
opportunities beyond what 
education offers, and access to 
proper pedagogical resources, 
too, is nearly impossible for them.
Even as conversations on the 
#MeToo platform continue to 
encourage other women who 
have the access to technology 
and the internet to speak out 
and provide support for each 
other, a parallel conversation 
should also be conducted on 
how to empower women who do 
not have this access. The goal of 
#MeToo will be left incomplete 
without the inclusion of all these 
women, because every woman 
left behind in this conversation, 
without the knowledge that a 
system of support exists for them, 
is a failure of the society’s duty 
to provide safe spaces for people 
who have experienced violence of 
all kinds.
This celebration of sisterhood, 
of feminism, in these times of 
societal and personal dif?culties, 
as we come face-to-face with 
revelations made by several 
women and men of the violence 
that they faced in their lives, 
should continue, along with 
reaching to other marginalized 
women too.
Bette Midler, in a now-deleted tweet, stirred up controversy by comparing women’s struggles to those experienced by minorities.

Taylor Swift did something bad - for bad reasons
LIAM O’CONNELL
Junior Staffwriter
Earlier this week, the United 
Nations Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (UN IPCC) 
published the Special Report on 
Global Warming of 1.5 degrees 
Celsius. In short, the report tells us 
that we have twelve years to enact 
planet-saving measures that keep 
global warming below the critical 
mark of 1.5 degrees. That might 
not sound like much, but the earth 
has already warmed by 1 degree 
since the beginning of the industrial 
period. Letting warming slip to two  
degrees could, according to the 
report, signi?cantly increase the 
risk of more extreme weather and 
social problems — including food 
shortages — that it would bring. 
And that’s before we bring up the 
serious geopolitical problems that 
would be introduced when whole 
regions of the world ?nd their 
natural resources depleted.
And yet, the bigger news story of 
the week was that Kanye West went 
on a roundabout, rambling rant in 
the White House.
It probably comes as no surprise 
that our president — who has 
famously described global warming 
as a Chinese-invented hoax and has 
used winter snow as evidence that 
climate change isn’t happening — 
has been largely silent on the IPCC’s 
?ndings. In an attempt to reassure 
concerned Americans, President 
Trump said, “I want to look at who 
drew it… Because I can give you 
reports that are fabulous, and I 
can give you reports that aren’t 
so good. But I will be looking at 
it, absolutely.” That was Tuesday; 
he’s said nothing since then. But 
I don’t want this to just be a rant 
about Trump, though. We’ve all had 
plenty of those, and if a group of UN 
scientists and experts can’t convince 
the man that global warming is a 
serious and genuine threat to the 
country and the world, I don’t stand 
a chance. The problem, really, is 
the general apathy toward climate 
change from politicians across both 
sides of the aisle.
If it is true that we only have 
twelve years to seriously correct 
our course when it comes to global 
warming, transitioning to a more 
environmentally sustainable 
country should be the number one 
issue in the upcoming elections. But 
it doesn’t seem that way. The party 
currently in control of Congress 
can’t decide if climate change is 
actually real, and is perfectly happy 
continuing to act in the interest of 
numerous polluting corporations. 
As a result, the bar is set low when it 
comes to American environmental 
policy - and it shows.
The Democrats — supposed to 
be an opposition — acknowledge 
the existence of climate change, 
which is a good start, but not 
much about their stance towards 
the environment suggests any 
sense of urgency about what could 
happen if we allow climate change 
to continue unchecked. In June 
of this year, Senate Democratic 
leader Chuck Schumer went after 
President Trump, calling on the 
President to do something to lower 
the price of gasoline. Because as the 
earth warms, in large part thanks 
to the effects of greenhouse gases, 
the solution is to encourage their 
use by burning more of them? And 
in August, the Democratic party 
reneged on a promise they made 
just two months earlier to stop 
taking donations from the fossil fuel 
industry. Neither Democratic party 
leader — not Chuck Schumer in 
the Senate nor Nancy Pelosi in the 
House of Representatives — have 
made any message on social media 
regarding the IPCC report. Quite 
simply, they’re not doing enough. 
Yes, they’re worlds better than 
the alternative - but now is truly 
the time that we need to demand 
more from our government when 
it comes to climate. That means 
that we can’t settle for anything 
less than a true rethink of the way 
we produce and use energy in this 
country.
Our generation has shown 
before that we are willing to make 
our voices heard on the issues that 
matter to us. Crucially, it is our 
generation that will have to live 
with the rami?cations of today’s 
inaction. The IPCC report tells us 
that it is still possible to keep global 
warming below the 1.5-degree 
threshold and stave off the most 
serious environmental, social, and 
geopolitical problems that climate 
change would bring. But politicians 
have made it clear that they need 
persuading in order to enact policy 
that looks after the earth rather 
than oil executives, and it is going to 
be our job to make the case that the 
future of the planet is something 
that matters.

Before beginning this, I would 
like to con?rm a few things. First, 
I am not saying Columbus is not 
a good person at all. Second, I 
am also not saying that genocide 
did not occur in the New World, 
because it most certainly did. 
The argument here is to consider 
whether or not Columbus himself 
was a perpetrator of genocide, 
as many people make it out to 
be. The de?nition of genocide, 
paraphrasing the United Nation’s 
de?nition, is a series of acts 
“committed with intent to destroy, 
in whole or in part, a national, 
ethnical, racial or religious group”. 
The key word is intent, which 
would be looking at if Columbus 
had any intention of destroying 
the native population prior to 
when he got there, or during his 
time as governor of Hispaniola.
Before looking at whether 
or not Columbus committed 
genocide, there are a few other 
misconceptions that need to be 
cleared up. First, Columbus knew 
he wasn’t in India. He thought 
he was somewhere off the coast 
of Japan. This wasn’t because 
he miscalculated the distance, 
but rather because no one really 
knew how large Asia was, where 
Japan really was, or whether or 
not the new land was connected 
to Asia. Second, Columbus was 
only the governor of Hispaniola 
until 1500, when he was removed 
for mismanagement - a point 
to be discussed later. Third, 
around 90 percent of the native 
population was killed by disease, 
and many of them died before 
any European even set foot in 
the New World. This was an 
unintended consequence, as the 
natives had no natural immunity 
built up to European diseases and 
disease could spread faster than 
Europeans can travel.
To determine intent, we have 
to look at Columbus’ words and 
actions. This is dif?cult, as both 
are often taken out of context. 
For example, take his journal 
entries. Many people cite the fact 
that he wanted to enslave the 
natives as soon as he got there, 
but there are a few problems 
with this. One, his journals are 
all transcriptions of the original 
journals that no longer exist. Two, 
there are multiple translations 
and they all differ, with some of 
the English translations a lot more 
biased than others. Three, many 
of those quotes get taken out of 
context. There are two big things 
people say his journals reveal. To 
paraphrase, one thing he says is 
that he wanted to enslave them 
and the second thing he says is 
that he could take 50 men and 
conquer and govern the natives 
as he wanted to. These are both 
misleading.
For starters, using a translation 
found in Readings in Latin 
American Civilization (thank you, 
Global Histories), he states that he 
thinks the people are “ingenious,” 
could be good servants, and could 
“readily become Christians.” He 
also goes on further to say that he 
wants to bring six of the natives 
back to Europe so that they can 
learn the language. Often, the only 
part of the quote shown is the part 
where Columbus says they could 
be “good servants.” But when put 
in context, that doesn’t mean he 
wanted to enslave them. The term 
“servant” could mean servant of 
God, or just a general servant. As 
for the other quote, that could hint 
at an intent to commit violence 
against the native population. 
However, this is the part where 
the different translations can 
say different things. In many 
English translations, that quote 
appears, but in the old Spanish 
transcription by Bartolome de 
las Casas, found in The Diario 
of Christopher Columbus’s First 
Voyage to America, there is no 
mention of Columbus wanting to 
conquer the natives. He does say 
that with 50 men, all the natives 
could be held in “subjection.” But 
to put that in full context, he’s 
also asking the king and queen 
what to do about new settlements, 
and he’s telling them that 50 men 
could hold the island if needed. 
This is corroborated by another 
translation from an American 
Journeys Collection document, 
document AJ-062. Looking at both 
quotes in full context, we can see 
that he didn’t come to Hispaniola 
with the intent to enslave and 
brutalize the native population.
The second aspect that needs 
to be considered is his time as 
governor of Hispaniola. He was 
removed in 1500 by the monarch 
because he was mistreating the 
Spanish colonists under his rule 
and was put in jail for six weeks. 
He most certainly mistreated the 
natives, and there is no doubt 
about that. But there is a letter he 
wrote while in jail where he says 
a few key things. The translation 
comes from another American 
Journeys Collection document, 
document AJ-067. He basically 
is complaining about native girls 
as young as nine or ten being 
sold into sexual slavery (another 
quote that is often taken out of 
context), and that there were 
many colonists who “did not 
deserve water in the sight of God 
and of the world.” He also states 
before that he could have taken 
advantage of his position, but 
“the maintenance of justice and 
the extension of the dominion of 
Her Highness has hitherto kept 
me down.” It does seem that his 
regime in Hispaniola was brutal, 
but a lot of the violence in?icted 
against the natives was done by 
the colonists themselves and not a 
direct result of Columbus’s orders. 
Based on this letter, Columbus 
was even against a lot of that 
violence and tried punishing the 
colonists for it. Columbus clearly 
isn’t a good person, but as of now, 
we are in the peak periods of his 
life where his actions and words 
can be interpreted as having the 
intention of commit genocide, and 
nothing really indicates that.
Genocide is a long process. 
People don’t just wake up one 
day and then decide to kill off 
an entire group of people for 
fun. It’s violence against a group 
being normalized until it becomes 
systematic and targeted killings. 
Based on this, genocide de?nitely 
occurred in the new world, 
but Columbus wasn’t the main 
perpetrator and didn’t really have 
the intent to commit genocide. It 
was later governors of Hispaniola, 
like Nicolas de Ovando, and later 
conquistadors, such as Hernan 
Cortes, who had clear intent to 
commit genocide, and many 
individual colonists were part 
of the process. It’s misleading to 
attribute such a long span of awful 
history on just one man, but that’s 
what seems to have happened. 
History is much more complicated 
than that.

“Pulling a Taylor Swift” is a 
term/phrase I’ve affectionately 
coined throughout casual discus-
sion with my friends and in my 
podcast, AP Marvel. It means to 
problematically abstain or remain 
neutral as a business tactic. Similar 
to how Iron Man 2 embodied Dis-
ney’s neutral stance on American 
warfare and the military industrial 
complex, Taylor Swift remained 
silent during the 2016 presidential 
selection in order to prevent alien-
ating a political side of her fanbase.
In the wake of Taylor Swift’s 
endorsement of Tennessee Senator 
Phil Bresdesen and Representative 
Jim Cooper via Instagram, it seems 
like “pulling a Taylor Swift” is no 
longer a relevant phrase I can use. 
Or is it? Let’s analyze the post that 
sparked “65,000 registrations in a 
single 24-hour period,” as stated 
by Kamari Guthrie, director of 
communications for Vote.org, to 
Buzzfeed News.
In her ?rst paragraph, Swift 
clearly states her beliefs in order 
to dispel those who used her as 
a white supremacist ?gurehead. 
Previously, Swift’s political silence, 
distinctly American lifestyle – i.e. 
all of her friends were white, and 
cultural insensitivities prompted 
white supremacists to cite her as an 
“Aryan goddess”, according to NPR. 
Swift then admits her reluctance 
to speak out politically and how 
she “feel[s] very differently about 
that now,” yet remains true to her 
own values, stating that “I always 
have and always will cast my vote 
based on which candidate will 
protect and ?ght for the human 
rights I believe we all deserve in 
this country.”
“Human rights” is a loaded 
word she throws into her post, 
using the broad de?nition before 
going into her speci?c views on 
LGBTQ rights, discrimination, and 
racism – the former of which felt 
like a given, the latter two carrying 
more of a personal tie to her 
career due to the whitewashing 
and appropriation incidents 
stemming from her music videos, 
“Wildest Dreams” and “Shake It 
Off.” Each sentence is ?rm, clear-
cut, and succinct, yet is written in 
a calculated way that still carries 
the weight of her own opinion. Her 
views are still her own, and it will 
be extremely hard for anyone to 
get Swift to change her mind.
The second paragraph of 
her post is the longest, where 
Swift chooses to go into more 
detail about Tennessee Senate 
candidates Marsha Blackburn 
and Phil Bredesen and Tennessee 
House candidate Jim Cooper. She 
acknowledges her own regrets 
of not being able to fully support 
having more women in of?ce 
before offering a detailed history 
(for an Instagram post) about 
Blackburn’s political voting record. 
However, her case and political 
appeals would have been stronger 
if she had also mentioned Bredesen 
and Cooper’s own political beliefs, 
pushing forward a problematic 
black & white mentality of politics 
and support.
Within her ?rst sentence, Swift 
pushes forward this stark black 
& white, or “burn it all down” 
mentality that is a horrifyingly 
large problem in politics today. 
It is a “you’re with us or you’re 
against us” mindset that became 
more widespread after the 2016 
presidential election, leading to 
relationships, communities, and 
families torn apart by political 
beliefs. It also spreads within news 
coverage, with Democrats and 
Republicans painted as ?rmly good 
or evil. This mentality is not new, 
but the political divide has become 
much deeper and wider since 
2016. Swift’s neglect to discuss 
more about Bredesen and Cooper’s 
beliefs in her post prevents the 
young voters she’s inspiring an 
opportunity from “educat[ing] 
yourself on the candidates 
running in your state,” adding an 
unnecessary crack in the already-
colossally deep political divide.
There’s only one key element 
in her third paragraph to analyze, 
and that is the date she advertises: 
Oct. 9, the last day to register to 
vote in Tennessee. Swift made this 
post on Oct. 8, which raises the 
question: why not earlier?
This is a question that plagues 
Taylor Swift’s entire history with 
political activism. Why didn’t 
she speak out about the 2016 
presidential election? Why didn’t 
she speak at or about women’s 
marches? Why didn’t she speak 
out during the Brett Kavanaugh 
hearings, especially since sexual 
assault was such an important 
issue to a former victim like herself 
that she would sue a radio host 
for a dollar over it just to make a 
point?
The world has ?nally cornered 
Taylor Swift into a place where 
taking a political stance was not 
just the only move she could 
make, but the best move she 
could make. Swift met with not 
just media attention, but also 
relieved reactions from the fans 
who questioned her silence. Fans 
talk about how Taylor Swift is 
reclaiming her political narrative 
from the white supremacists who 
painted her as their American 
sweetheart.
Quite honestly, I have little 
doubt that the beliefs that Swift 
posted about on Instagram are her 
true ones. It is simply convenient 
that her beliefs fall in line with the 
Democratic beliefs of Hollywood 
and a slightly more substantial 
portion of her fans. In the grand 
scheme of things, Taylor Swift’s 
political beliefs don’t matter. In 
a survey about celebrity opinion 
conducted by The Hollywood 
Reporter, 58 percent of individuals 
across the United States were not 
interested in the political and 
social opinions of celebrities, with 
only nine percent of respondents 
strongly interested in what 
celebrities have to say. In fact, it is 
more impactful for celebrities to 
voice their opinions on “universal 
issues with bipartisan appeal.”
What we should really be ask-
ing is “why.” Why is she support-
ing Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper? 
Why is she choosing to voice this 
opinion to her fans? Swift urges us 
to “vote based on who most closely 
represents your values”, and we 
as a public have had little context 
to what these values are and why 
they matter to her, making us ques-
tion why what she says should 
matter.
In the last sentence of Swift’s 
second paragraph, she states that 
“For a lot of us, we may never ?nd 
a candidate or party with whom 
we agree 100% on every issue, but 
we have to vote anyway.” Swift 
also suffers from this same or-
deal. While Swift doesn’t want to 
entirely voice her political beliefs, 
she must speak anyway. Unfortu-
nately, as much as she tries to hide 
it, she is not speaking for the right 
reasons.

The Students for a Democratic Society 
(SDS) demonstration at the Technical 
Opportunities Conference (TOC) misses the 
point.
Shortly after the TOC (which I didn’t 
attend for reasons that will soon be clear), I 
read a Tartan article reporting on this action. 
I felt the Carnegie Mellon SDS’s actions were 
debatable, and their reasons as reported 
by The Tartan simplistic. On the action 
themselves, this action is unlikely to have 
any effect on the four companies targeted 
(why those four and not include Boeing, for 
instance?). At best, they may decide to go 
recruit elsewhere, but this is not going to 
impact their behavior and pro?ts in any way. 
This is not going to have the sort of impact as 
the Stanford April 3rd movement.
On the other side, it may have some 
negative consequences on the image of 
Carnegie Mellon and its alumni, as this 
protest will be associated with Carnegie 
Mellon’s image. Student outreach and 
fostering a debate on other opportunities 
could have been as appropriate without 
publicly involving the school. But regardless 
of the actual action, I have been unable to 
get any further information on the reason 
and the objective of Carnegie Mellon’s 
new SDS movement apart from The Tartan 
reporting and the previous SDS article. 
Saying that corporations that work for the 
U.S. military (usually with close cooperation 
with the federal government) are “bad for 
humanity” is quite naïve and imprecise, 
and Lockheed Martin pro?ts come basically 
from the federal government (either federal 
contract or exportation obtained by the 
US diplomacy). Those pro?ts from selling 
weapons are, and the use of said weapons 
are, as much the federal government 
responsibility as from the company. Also, 
like Ukraine, the South China Sea, South 
Ossetia, and many others, some geopolitics 
actors are keen to use force and military 
might in order to achieve their end, meaning 
that democracies cannot sadly get rid of 
their armed forces, and consequently there 
will be an industrial base to produce the said 
weapon. That said there are indeed several 
actual problems with the military-industrial 
complex in the United States, which require 
precision.
The term “military-industrial complex” 
was coined by President Eisenhower in 
his ?nal address, where the WWII general 
warned the USA to guard against its military-
industrial complex. His point was not that 
there should be no industry dedicated to 
ful?lling the need of the armed forces, but 
that the people and its representative should 
not let the military industrial unchecked and 
exert oversight and control over the military. 
And today, sadly, the representative of the 
United States citizens has failed to keep this 
complex in check. The modern United States 
tends to have a big respect for its soldiers 
and veterans but fails to make the criticism it 
badly needs. The Vietnam war was followed 
by actual criticism of the decision taken 
and changes. The last military operation 
that was a strategic victory is 91 the First 
gulf war. Several unsuccessful military 
operations later, no criticism of them are in 
sight. While all the other budget is reduced 
and federal investment in infrastructure, 
healthcare is usually opposed by part of the 
public opinion. It is worth mentioning that 
the biggest federal infrastructure investment 
since the end of the war —  with the interstate 
network built by the same Eisenhower — 
managed to pass it on the defense budget. 
This issue will not be solved by protesting 
the companies but by getting involved in 
politics and holding your representative 
accountable.
The selling of weapons to dictators and 
their use against civilians is the responsibility 
of the government that approved this 
exportation (of which the U.S. is, so far, the 
only one guilty). This is also the point where 
I’d like to remind people that a lot of military 
technologies have dual purposes and that 
without the military industrial complex a 
lot of technologies would simply not exist. 
The internet was made possible by the 
involvement of DARPA. GPS was a military 
network, and even more so, satellites are still 
launched over derivative of ICBMs. (Who 
would have bet that Nazi V2 would lead to 
such a vital technology?). Less well known, 
the silicon valley ecosystem emerged 
because of the military industrial complex 
research on radars during the cold war.
Military research has its ethical issues, 
but precise cases need to be invoked. Who 
denigrates Einstein, Oppenheimer, Fermi 
for their involvement in the Manhattan 
project and in the two atomic detonations 
over Japan? They served their country in a 
time of war, and the decision was made by 
the president of the United States. Today, 
the ethical issue over armed drones, the use 
of neural networks for target acquisition 
are actual real things that deserve to be 
debated. For instance, my home country 
has decided against having armed drones, 
and drone pilots are projected to the theatre 
and instead of operating from the metropole 
and going back home after a day job of 
shooting people like U.S. drones operator 
do. Autonomous vehicles, targeting without 
humans in the loop, are subject that need to 
be debated and on which we may decide on 
the red-lines that we refuse to cross (no one 
at Carnegie Mellon is ever going to work on 
offensive chemical or biological weapons).
And yet, as the latest issue of The Tartan 
mentions, the DARPA Urban challenge is 
one of the things that made possible the 
self-driving vehicle ecosystem that has hired 
many from Carnegie Mellon (Uber, Waymo 
and others).
To sum up, military industrial complex 
involvement at Carnegie Mellon is not 
a “bad” thing, by itself, but individual 
research project ethical issue should not be 
overlooked. The SDS should strive to tackle 
speci?c issues along with participating in a 
broader movement to hold accountable the 
government. And as the issues of the military 
complex are mainly political, for you readers 
that are U.S. citizen, it is also precisely time 
to express yourself in the coming midterms 
(the elections, but good luck everyone for 
the midterm exams too).

Madeline Kim’s article, 
“The fallacy of the mainstream 
#BelieveWomen tag,” intelligently 
parses the relationship between 
the #BelieveWomen tag and some 
statistics of sexual assault, but 
she gets her lesson fundamentally 
wrong. The “fallacy” of the 
#BelieveWomen tag, she claims, 
is that it doesn’t represent 
other (male or otherwise) 
voices of sexual assault, and 
furthermore that “the message 
#BelieveWomen can easily be 
perverted into becoming an 
environment where male victims 
fear that their voices…won’t be 
heard.” This is simply a return 
to the same rationale volleyed 
against the #BlackLivesMatter 
tag. #BlackLivesMatter does not 
mean, imply, or attempt to bring 
about a world in which white 
lives don’t matter. Neither does 
#BelieveWomen mean, imply, or 
attempt to bring about a world in 
which men aren’t believed. The 
point is that men are believed and 
women aren’t, just as the point 
is that white lives do matter, and 
black lives don’t in our society. 
The tag is simply one in the long 
history of women attempting to 
gain their legitimate and justi?ed 
authority, not an attempt to gain 
authority over others.

Sokal Squared just con?rms a foregone conclusion

Assissant Forum Editor
The world of academia just got 
exposed, and it isn’t pretty.
As reported by The Atlantic, 
three humanities scholars have 
spent the past 12 months writing 20 
papers boasting ridiculous claims, 
attempting to get them published 
within reputable journals in areas 
such as gender studies and queer 
studies. Despite how ludicrous 
their submissions were (one paper 
suggested physically abusing 
privileged students as a form of 
historical reparation), their success 
rate is even more stupefying: seven 
were published, seven were still 
under review, and only six had 
been outright rejected.
This hoax has been termed 
“Sokal Squared” in honor of the 
original experiment conducted by 
Alan Sokal, a professor of Physics 
at New York University in the 
1990s. The original Sokal hoax did 
much the same thing, but Sokal 
Squared is of far greater scope 
(hence the name).
The issue with targeting 
academia is that no matter 
what you ?nd, you’re going to 
upset someone, especially in our 
politically charged atmosphere. 
Sokal Squared proved that to a T;  
as information about the study was 
revealed, conservative media had a 
?eld day. With a signi?cant portion 
of the right comprised of climate 
change deniers and individuals 
with staunch anti-science views, 
conservatives didn’t lose any time 
in using Sokal Squared to discredit 
anything and everything contrary 
to their beliefs. Meanwhile, the 
left tried their best to defend 
their favorite liberal outlets, 
attempting to justify the error by 
saying that some areas of study 
are “morally” justi?ed and that the 
mistakes shouldn’t be extrapolated 
indiscriminately.
Both sides are wrong, trying to 
frame the facts in their own self-
serving contexts. But more than 
anything, Sokal Squared proves 
absolutely nothing - aside from 
the fact that even academics like to 
pull pranks.
Anyone who’s even remotely 
open-minded and rational 
understands that because research 
and peer-review are done by 
humans, things are bound to go 
wrong. It’s unfair to hold science 
to an unrealistic standard of 
perfection, and just ?at out wrong 
to do it for sel?sh, ideological 
goals.
If you think about it, the peer-
review process for distinguished 
journals in all ?elds of inquiry 
acts like a sieve to separate the 
legitimate contributions from 
the general riff-raff, giving the 
spotlight to the work that’s most 
deserving. That’s not to say, of 
course, that incorrect data or 
unsubstantiated papers never 
make it through. Whenever 
that happens, though, those 
who see science and intellectual 
progression as a threat—rather 
than a boon—to their way of 
life seize upon it, using extreme 
induction to claim that everything 
else is wrong. It’s the equivalent of 
saying that getting one question 
wrong on a 100 question test 
results in a score of zero.
Peer-review and research are 
imperfect processes, and even 
more so when you try to game 
the system. The problem with 
the premise of Sokal Squared 
is that if you intentionally send 
out a concentrated blast of junk, 
proportionally more of it is going 
to make it through the net. What’s 
more, given the volume of articles 
peer reviewers must go through, 
it’s impossible to maintain the 
same level of scrutiny for every one 
of the innumerable papers that 
they come across. So yes, a large 
portion of the 20 papers that were 
put out did make it into the review 
process, but all that proves is that 
the ?aws that have been long-
suspected of existing are there.
The more concerning question 
is what will come of Sokal Squared. 
Despite having contributed 
nothing, the hoax helped stir the 
pot, galvanizing those who try 
their hardest to defeat science (as 
stupid as that sounds). It’s ironic 
when those who decry scienti?c 
inquiry nevertheless bene?t 
from resulting innovations, they 
complain noticeably less, and with 
an administration dependent on 
such individuals as a voter base, 
the future seems increasingly 
uncertain. One can only hope that 
as the younger generation becomes 
more cemented in society, we can 
change the status quo from the top 
down.
Right now, it’s not possible 
to ensure perfection for every 
research project, so that’s not 
an option. Rather, so long as we 
focus on our pursuits and avoid 
stooping to their level, we can lead 
by example, working towards a 
brighter future for all and making 
sure that big topics in science — 
space exploration, climate change, 
and renewable energy — remain 
at the forefront of the national 
conversation.
Together, as a community of 
scholars and citizens, we must do 
our part to sti?e ignorance with 
intellect.

A new study from the 
Washington University 
School of Medicine in St. 
Louis, Missouri suggests 
that even light drinking four 
or more times per week can 
increase the risk of prema-
ture death by about 20 per-
cent. The study, titled “Daily 
drinking is associated with 
increased mortality” and 
published in Alcoholism: 
Clinical & Experimental 
Research on Oct. 3, evalu-
ated data from more than 
400,000 participants with 
ages ranging from 18 to 35, 
aiming to analyze the risks 
speci?cally for light drink-
ers, unlike previous studies 
that have looked at alcohol 
consumption in a broader 
scope.
First author and assis-
tant professor of psychiatry 
Sarah M. Hartz (M.D., 
Ph.D.) thinks people should 
be wary of past research 
suggesting that mild to 
moderate drinking can have 
health bene?ts. “It used to 
seem like having one or two 
drinks per day was no big 
deal, and there even have 
been some studies suggest-
ing it can improve health,” 
she told ScienceDaily. “But 
now we know that even the 
lightest daily drinkers have 
an increased mortality risk.”
Indeed, prior work has 
shown some cardiovascu-
lar bene?ts of, for example, 
a daily glass of wine, but 
the new study ?nds that 
the increased cancer risk 
from alcohol consumption 
drives up the mortality risk 
enough to negate any posi-
tive effects.
“Consuming one or two 
drinks about four days 
per week seemed to pro-
tect against cardiovascular 
disease, but drinking every 
day eliminated those ben-
e?ts,” said Hartz. “With 
regard to cancer risk, any 
drinking at all was detri-
mental.”
The federally-funded study 
through the Centers for 
Disease Control and Preven-
tion had two groups of focus: 
340,668 National Health 
Interview Survey partici-
pants (ages 18 to 85), and 
93,653 individuals (ages 40 
to 60) who visited Veterans 
Administration clinics as 
outpatients. According to 
Hartz, although a 20 per-
cent increase in mortality 
risk among individuals in 
their 20s and 30s may not 
be very signi?cant since 
the overall chance of death 
remains low, the same 
increase for people over age 
75 can be astounding, espe-
cially for individuals with a 
family history of cancer.
It is possible that over 
time, the personalization of 
medicine will allow doctors 
to recommend an amount of 
alcohol consumption that is 
safe for an individual based 
on their susceptibility to 
certain conditions. For ex-
ample, someone at high risk 
for heart disease might ?nd 
that occasional light drink-
ing (three or less times per 
week) is helpful to reduce 
the chance of cardiovascu-
lar issues, while someone 
prone to cancer might want 
to abstain.
The Washington University 
study comes not long after a 
review article of more than 
700 studies in 195 countries 
published in The Lancet 
found that “the safest level 
of drinking is none.” Hartz 
agrees, “Overall, I do think 
people should no longer 
consider a glass of wine a 
day to somehow be healthy.”

There’s a quite a bit 
of excitement surround-
ing the JAXA (Japan 
Aerospace Exploration 
Agency) Hyabusa2 proj-
ect, and rightly so — 
launched in Dec. 2014, 
the mothership and its 
hopping probes have 
not only reached the 
Ryugu asteroid, but have 
also sent back stunning 
images of the asteroid’s 
surface, giving us a close 
view of these ?ying 
chunks of space rock. 
However, JAXA will have 
to wait a little longer 
to get physical samples 
from the asteroid: the 
mothership’s landing on 
Ryugu has been delayed 
until January.
The Hyabusa2 project 
consists of three separate 
phases. First, after the 
mothership arrived in 
Ryugu’s orbit, two solar 
powered hoppers named 
MINERVA-II 1A and MI-
NERVA-II 1B were sent 
to scour the surface, tak-
ing a different approach 
to traditional wheeled 
rovers by leveraging the 
weak gravity to literally 
jump from point to point. 
Following this came 
MASCOT, a smaller, 
more short-lived lander 
tasked with collecting 
some more preliminary 
data about the asteroid, 
which was then sent 
back to the Hyabusa2 
mothership, as reported 
by SPACE.com.
The last phase of the 
project involves landing 
the mothership onto the 
asteroid itself to collect 
physical samples. These 
samples would then be 
returned to Earth some 
time around Dec. 2020. 
However, JAXA recently 
announced that this 
phase of the mission, 
originally scheduled 
for late October, will be 
delayed until early Janu-
ary of next year, as re-
ported by Gadgets 360.
The problem is fairly 
simple: there’s no sur-
face on the asteroid ?at 
enough to stage a good 
landing. After analyz-
ing the data collected 
by the hoppers, the 
project team concluded 
that Ryugu’s surface is 
far more uneven than 
originally anticipated, 
making it very dif?cult 
to land the mother-
ship without potentially 
damaging the craft in 
a hard landing. And, 
when you’re dealing 
with a piece of highly 
specialized spacefaring 
hardware that cost $260 
million to build, the last 
thing you’d want to do 
is knock a few screws 
loose. So for now, the 
mothership is maintain-
ing its orbit while the 
team back on Earth uses 
the gathered data to ?nd 
a suitable landing loca-
tion.
While the current con-
ditions may worry some, 
the team is con?dent 
that the mission will suc-
ceed. They base their 
optimism on the success 
of the ?rst Hyabusa mis-
sion, which achieved its 
goals despite numerous 
setbacks and was lauded 
as a scienti?c triumph.
Though no one can 
say for sure whether 
Hyabusa2 will return to 
Earth with the promised 
samples, late is better 
than never, and scien-
tists are hopeful that 
with this new data, we 
can make greater strides 
towards answering some 
of the most interest-
ing questions about our 
place in the universe.

You know what they say: 
another year, another con-
tribution to the preponder-
ance of scienti?c evidence 
that humans had a lot of 
sex with Neanderthals.
A new study by David 
Enard, assistant professor 
at the University of Arizona 
Ecology and Evolutionary 
Biology Department, and 
Dmitri Petrov, the Michelle 
and Kevin Douglas Professor 
of Biology at Stanford 
University, suggests that this 
interaction may have played 
a key role in humans not 
dying from a Neanderthal 
cold back in the day.
Enard and Petrov looked 
at the parts of the human 
genome that have to do 
with defense against patho-
gens and compared these 
stretches with that of the 
Neanderthal genome. They 
found that there was a 
similarity, suggesting that 
Neanderthal DNA plays a 
part in our modern genetic 
foundation for immunity.
The close contact be-
tween Neanderthals and 
humans at at least two 
points in history, Enard 
and Petrov claim, meant 
that Neanderthals and 
humans exchanged their 
species-speci?c viruses. 
Luckily for us, human 
and Neanderthal genetic 
interaction in the form of 
procreation also probably

On Aug. 31, the Califor-
nia state legislature passed 
Senate Bill 822, which 
creates regulations to pre-
serve free and equal access 
to the internet. On Sept. 
30, Governor Jerry Brown 
signed the bill into law.
Mere hours later, the 
U.S. Department of Justice 
?led a suit with the state 
of California, claiming 
that the bill attempted to 
impose regulations outside 
the state’s jurisdiction. On 
Oct. 3, telecommunications 
industry groups — The 
American Cable Association, 
the Cellular Telecommuni-
cations Industry Associa-
tion (a group representing 
the wireless industry), the 
National Cable Television 
Association, and USTelecom 
(representing the broad-
band association) — joint-
ly ?led their own suit in 
California’s federal district 
court.
“Under the Constitu-
tion, states do not regu-
late interstate commerce 
— the federal government 
does,” said U.S. Attorney 
General Jeff Sessions in a 
statement. The telecommu-
nications groups back up 
the federal stance: “As the 
Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) has re-
peatedly recognized, due to 
the inherently interstate na-
ture of Internet service, it is

passed along the alleles 
needed for better immunity. 
The protection, and the 
positive evolutionary selec-
tion it affords, also answers 
the question of why humans 
may have retained some 
Neanderthal DNA into the 
modern era.
Neanderthals and hu-
mans diverged genetically 
around 500,000 to 800,000 
years ago. Human contact 
with Neanderthals around 
B.C. 70,000 in Eurasia 
left genetic evidence of 
Neanderthal DNA in most 
humans not of African 
descent. This study adds 
a building block to under-
standing the ways that this 
DNA might affect human 
development to this day.
Viruses are more 
important in shaping genet-
ics than you might think. 
These Neanderthal viruses, 
and whether or not people 
had immunity passed on 
from the Neanderthals, 
decided which humans 
that came in contact with 
Neanderthals and their 
pathogens would survive to 
pass on their genes through 
positive selection.
The “poison-antidote” 
theory, or the theory that 
Neanderthals and hu-
mans were able to survive 
exposure to new pathogens 
through intermingling had 
previously been theorized, 
but this study provides “pre-
liminary evidence” that this 
theory might have indeed 
transpired. The authors 
suggest that 32 percent of 
Asians and 25 percent of 
Europeans might have been 
genetically affected by this 
positive selection.
Enard, in an interview 
with ScienceDaily, mar-
veled at the discoveries that 
can be made by delving 
into DNA. “You can think of 
these genetic adaptations 
like footprints from long-
extinct dinosaurs preserved 
in fossilized mud.”

Net neutrality suit fuels debate about the open internet
INTERNET, from A7
impossible or impracticable 
for an Internet service pro-
vider... to distinguish traf-
?c that moves only within 
California from traf?c that 
crosses state borders.”
Supporters of the law 
argue that it institutes basic 
consumer protection for 
residents of California. “Big 
telecom companies hate 
the California net neutral-
ity bill because it prevents 
them from screwing over 
their customers more than 
they already do,” said Evan 
Greer, deputy director of 
activist group Fight for the 
Future, in a statement.
In Dec. 2017, the FCC’s 
?ve commissioners voted 
3-2 to repeal the federal 
net neutrality protections 
that had been in place since 
2015. The rules had prohib-
ited various practices con-
sidered unfair — charging 
more for faster internet ser-
vice, for instance, or charg-
ing different prices for vis-
iting different sites — and 
the vote to repeal them was 
widely decried by consum-
ers, legislators, and advo-
cacy groups. “This decision 
puts the Federal Commu-
nications Commission on 
the wrong side of history, 
the wrong side of the law, 
and the wrong side of the 
American public,” wrote 
Commissioner Jessica 
Rosenworcel, one of the 
two who voted against the 
measure, in her dissent.
California is not the ?rst 
state to enact its own net 
neutrality rules — nine 
other states have taken ac-
tion either through legisla-
tion, or gubernatorial ex-
ecutive order — but, as the 
U.S.’s most populous state 
and home to the headquar-
ters of many leaders in the 
tech industry, a net neu-
trality victory could set a 
precedent for standards in 
other states.
The net neutrality pro-
visions in SB 822 are also 
some of the nation’s strict-
est. The bill largely mir-
rors the recently abolished 
federal protections, but 
enhances them by banning 
the use of “zero-rating” 
by internet providers to 
restrict access to services 
other than their own — for 
example, allowing users 
to view the provider’s own 
video streaming service 
for free, but charging for 
viewing Net?ix, Hulu, and 
other external streaming 
services.
“The ?ght for social 
change and progressive 
values is directly tied to a 
free and open internet,” 
said Assemblyman Miguel 
Santiago (D-Los Angeles) 
to the LA Times after the 
bill was signed. “This mea-
sure ensures that we, in 
California, will maintain 
a free and open internet 
that doesn’t discriminate 
or price users or content 
differently.” Santiago, who 
initially attempted to scale 
back SB 822 but was pres-
sured by his constituents, is 
a co-author of the ?nal bill.
Industry groups claim 
the law will not pro-
tect consumers, and will 
achieve nothing but wast-
ing the time of internet 
service providers and the 
government as they work 
to ensure compliance.
“Once again the 
California legislature has 
enacted an extreme and il-
legal state law attempting 
to frustrate federal policy,” 
said Sessions. 
“The Justice Department 
should not have to spend 
valuable time and resourc-
es to ?le this suit today, but 
we have a duty to defend 
the prerogatives of the 
federal government and 
protect our Constitutional 
order. We will do so with 
vigor. We are con?dent that 
we will prevail in this case 
— because the facts are on 
our side.”
California lawmakers, 
however, are prepared to 
hold their own. 
“Unlike [Chairman Ajit] 
Pai’s FCC, California isn’t 
run by the big telecom and 
cable companies,” said 
California State Senator 
Scott Wiener, original au-
thor of SB 822. 
“Pai can take whatever 
potshots at California he 
wants. The reality is that 
California is the world’s 
innovation capital, and un-
like the crony capitalism 
promoted by the Trump 
administration, California 
understands exactly what 
it takes to foster an open 
innovation economy with a 
level playing ?eld.”

Federal Communications Commission chair Ajit Pai opposes net netruality. “Let the free market for wireless services and devices ?ourish,”
he said, asserting that “If the government gets out of the way, the wireless marketplace will continue to be an American success story.”

As this week’s loser, 
your resident Photo Editor 
is here to pick up the 
recap. Bear with me as I 
try to navigate the Tartan 
Fantasy’s results for the 
first time. Despite my 
unexpected loss, it looks 
like I’m holding fast to my 
third place ranking.
Last Manning Standing 
over TARTAN FANTASY, 
83.54 to 71.80
It was a sore loss this 
week for my team TARTAN 
FANTASY, defeated by 
Publisher Caleb Miller, 
who team, Last Manning 
Standing, has a solid 4-1 
record, bumping him to 
the top of the rankings. 
Meanwhile, TARTAN FAN-
TASY had a rough week, 
finishing dead last in the 
rankings, with Chicago 
Bears running back Jordan 
Howard letting me down 
hard with zero points. 
Dallas Cowboys running 
back Ezekiel Elliott 
disappointed by failing 
to beat projections, scor-
ing only 8.40 points for 
TARTAN FANTASY. Last 
Manning Standing’s team 
has had a strong showing 
this season, with his 
starters raking in wins.
futbol over Gin and Bear 
It, 94.08 to 86.94
This week, Visual Editor 
Tracy Le’s team futbol 
took down our perpetually 
unlucky Sports Editor, 
Marika Yang, so let’s all 
enjoy the irony as Yang 
continues to sit in last place 
in the rankings. It’s hard to 
believe our resident sports 
enthusiast is the underdog 
of the season with a record 
of 1-4, but as they say, 
“it really do be like that 
sometimes.” Le’s team is 
sitting at fourth place in 
the rankings, but things 
are looking up for futbol, 
as it took a 15.00 lead on 
Thursday to speed ahead 
of Gin and Bear It. With 
Arizona Cardinals running 
back David Johnson’s two 
touchdowns bringing in 
19.10 points and Cincinnati 
Bengals running back 
Joe Mixon finishing with 
a solid 17.50 points, 
team futbol managed to 
compensate well for the 
disappointing 0.00 points 
Greg Olsen pulled in.
Team Gin and Bear It’s 
loss can be chalked up to 
the underwhelming 4.10 
points scored by Oakland 
Raiders running back 
Marshawn Lynch — a 
fraction of the 12.45 points 
he had been projected to 
score — giving Yang a slim 
but disappointing loss.
mmichelle123 over Slugs, 
128.82 to 92.68
Pillbox Editor Michelle 
Madlansacay’s team 
mmichelle123 crushed 
Operations Manager Adam 
Tunnard’s team, Slugs, 
with the third highest 
score this season: 128.82 
points. Madlansacay beat 
expectations, getting 38.3 
percent more points than 
the projected 93.12 her 
team was expected to 
achieve. This lucky turn 
of events has brought up 
Madlansacay two spots 
to fifth in the rankings, a 
fortunate save considering 
she was hovering near 
the bottom, at 7th, just 
a week ago. Slugs met 
expectations, but a solid 
92.68 was still not enough 
to prevent his descent into 
sixth place.
GOAT But Ironically over 
newz 129.24 to 84.02
This week Assistant 
Pillbox Editor Izzy Sio’s 
team (newly renamed) 
GOAT But Ironically got 
the last word by destroying 
News Editor Nora 
Mattson’s team newz in 
the second-highest scoring 
win of the season. GOAT 
But Ironically was carried 
to victory by Los Angeles 
Rams running back Todd 
Gurley, New England 
Patriots quarterback Tom 
Brady, and Indianapo-
lis Colts tight end Eric 
Ebron, who collectively 
scored 79.34 points for 
Sio. Brady lives up to his 
name by hitting his high-
est point total so far with 
27.54 points, and Gurley 
came in strong as well 
with the second-highest 
point total of the league. 
This strong performance 
put GOAT But Ironically 
at an advantage with the 
second-largest point gap 
win of the Tartan Fantasy 
League. Unfortunately, 
this win was not enough 
to bring Sio up in the rank-
ings, leaving her sitting at 
7th. Mattson’s team newz 
scored a mediocre 84.02 
points, dropping to sec-
ond place. Her strongest 
scorer was New York Gi-
ants running back Saquon 
Barkley, who scored 24.90 
points.
Next week in Week 
6, the Tartan Fantasy 
League matchups feature 
league-leading Miller’s 
team Last Manning 
Standing facing off against 
last-place team, Yang’s 
team Gin and Bear It, 
while my team TARTAN 
FANTASY will take on 
Tunnard’s team Slugs. 
Le’s team futbol will meet 
Mattson’s team newz, 
while it’s a battle for 
Pillbox when Sio’s team 
challenges Madlansacay’s 
team mmichelle123.

SOCCER, from A10
Over in the French 
league, we have a 
high-?ying Paris Saint 
Germain team with young 
superstars Kylian Mbappe 
and Neymar Jr. playing 
great attacking soccer. 
Despite the disappointing 
loss to Liverpool in the 
?rst week of this season’s 
Champions League and 
the appointment of a new 
coach, PSG are already top 
of their domestic league 
and are the favorites 
to win the Champions 
League. Then, we have 
one of the favorites to win 
this season’s Champions 
League, Italian giants 
Juventus. Their recent 
acquisition of Ronaldo and 
some young Italian talents 
have propelled the club to 
an undefeated start to their 
domestic and international 
season.
Another favorite to win 
this season’s Champions 
League is Manchester City, 
the 2017-2018 Premier 
League champions. Under 
coach Pep Guardiola, 
Manchester City has 
played some of the best 
soccer the world has seen. 
They are currently top of 
their domestic league and 
are favorites to win all their 
current competitions. 
On the other hand, 
there is Manchester City’s 
main rivals Manchester 
United. The team has 
struggled to adopt coach 
Jose Mourinho’s defensive 
tactics during their last 
seasons. With one of their 
worst starts to the domestic 
season and an elimination 
from the Football League 
Cup, rumors were swirling 
that a new manager 
would be appointed. 
However, the team’s recent 
comeback win against 
Newcastle United dispelled 
the rumors for now. Then 
there is Liverpool, the 
young and exciting team 
considered by many as the 
only team able to challenge 
Manchester City for the 
league title. In spite of 
the disappointing start to 
the season by last year’s 
Liverpool star Mohammed 
Salah, the team has played 
well and is currently joint  
leader at the top of the 
league.
English team Chelsea 
has also done well so far 
this season. New coach 
Maurizio Sarri’s tactics 
have improved the team 
and made them joint 
leaders of the league 
in points, with season 
highlights including wins 
against Premier League 
competitors Liverpool and 
Arsenal. 
Finally, we have the 
two London clubs Arsenal 
and Tottenham. Arsenal 
started this season with 
two straight losses but 
have since bounced back 
and put together a string 
of consecutive wins. Their 
eternal rivals, a young 
Tottenham squad, started 
their season with no new 
transfers, but a series 
of wins. Recent losses, 
however, have dispelled 
some of the excitement 
that surrounded the team 
at the start of the season.
With all of this, we have 
covered the ?rst quarter of 
the 2018-2019 European 
soccer season. The 
international break gives 
clubs a chance to regroup, 
but in the past it has also 
proven to be detrimental to 
hot teams. We’ll just have 
to see how everyone fares. 
Despite it being obvious 
that soccer, and sports 
in general, is a matter of 
highs and lows throughout 
a season, we can all agree 
that there are few highs 
that match the excitement 
of watching your team 
play, and for this, we will 
just have to wait until 
next weekend when club 
football play resumes.
Ups and downs in first quarter 
SPORTS BRIEFS OF THE WEEK
Women’s Soccer
Over the weekend, 
the 21st-ranked Carnegie 
Mellon University women’s 
soccer team competed in 
two games, on Friday, Oct. 
12 and Sunday, Oct. 14, in 
doubleheaders alongside  
the men’s team.
The Tartans hosted 
13th-ranked University 
of Chicago on Friday 
in a University Athletic 
Association (UAA) contest. 
Chicago rallied from a goal 
down to top the Tartans, 
2–1.
In the 40th minute, the 
Tartans earned a free kick 
that sophomore Kristen 
Chong stepped up to take. 
The sophomore ?red the 
shot from the center of the 
?eld, 25 yards out, into the 
upper right corner for her 
?rst goal of the year.
An unfortunate handball 
by the Tartans inside the 
box in the 47th minute 
led to a penalty kick goal, 
which evened the score at 
1–1. Chicago continued to 
put pressure on the Tartans 
with shots on goal in the 
54th and 57th minutes.
The Tartans had some 
chances in the second 
half, but failed to convert. 
Chicago scored the 
go-ahead goal in the 85th 
minute with a shot from the 
left side to the far post.
Senior Kaily Bruch had 
an opportunity to tie the 
game a minute later but 
was denied the shot.
Men’s Soccer
On the men’s side, the 
13th-ranked squad took on 
the No. 1 ranked University 
of Chicago on Friday. The 
Maroons fought back from 
an early goal by the Tartans 
to stay unbeaten with a 2–1 
victory. The Tartans are 
now 8–2–2 overall and 1–2 
in the UAA.
To start the scoring, 
Senior Anthony Gulli 
picked off inside the 18-
yard box and put a shot in 
the net at the far post for 
the 1–0 Carnegie Mellon 
lead.Chicago knotted the 
score at one in the 17th 
minute with a play into 
the box. Less than three 
minutes later the Maroons 
served a ball for a header 
which Tartan keeper Alec 
Lam swatted away, making 
him unable to defend a 
rebound header for the go-
ahead goal.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
hosted 23rd-ranked 
Washington University in 
St. Louis, with the Bears 
earning a 2–1 double-over-
time victory. The Tartans 
are now 8–3–1 overall and 
1–3 in UAA play.
Junior Elliot Cohen put 
the Tartans ahead 1–0 in 
the 14th minute after he 
headed in a long pass from 
Junior defender Jacob 
Moskowitz. In the 35th 
minute, the Bears put a 
shot by Lam, ?ring a shot 
from two yards out and 
over Lam who attempted to 
cut the angle.
In the second half, 
Cohen’s low-driving 
shot in the 71st minute 
was stopped while Lam 
continuously came off 
his line to punch service 
attempts clear of the net.
Washington had three 
scoring opportunities in 
the ?rst overtime but all 
three were wide of the net. 
In the ?rst minute of the 
second session, the Bears 
got forward and scored off 
a rebounded shot.
Volleyball
The Carnegie Mellon 
University volleyball team 
hosted the UAA Round 
Robin #2 over the weekend.
On Saturday, the 
Tartans split their matches, 
falling 3–2 to Washington 
University in St. Louis 
(WashU) and defeating 
Brandeis University in 
straight sets. They are now 
15–6 for the year and 4–1 in 
UAA play.
In the ?ve-set thriller 
with WashU, the Tartans  
dropped the ?rst set 25–19 
before the second set 
went in favor of the Bears, 
28–26. The third set also 
took extra points, as the 
Tartans picked up a 27–25 
win. After a fourth set win 
by the Tartans, 25–21, the 
match went to the deciding 
?fth set. The Bears pulled 
out to a 9–5 lead and 
?nished off the match with 
a 15–10 win.
Against Brandeis, 
Jurgens led the offensive 
attack with eight kills while 
Mueller and sophomore 
Jordan Allen each had 
?ve kills. Foose picked up 
another three block assists 
and Yew led the defense 
with 11 digs.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
welcomed Case Western 
Reserve University. The 
Tartans won three sets to 
one, 25–18, 25–19, 19–25, 
25–18. Mueller led the 
team with 20 kills, closely 
followed by Jurgens with 
16. Yew recorded 23 digs, 
while So-Holloway had a 
team-high 54 assists.
Next week, the Tartans 
will be back at home 
hosting the Carnegie 
Mellon Tournament. Their 
?rst match is set for Friday, 
Oct. 19 against Alma 
College.

Cline breaks passing record as Tartans win in thriller

Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon 
University football team 
hosted Bethany College 
Bison at Gesling Stadium on 
Saturday, Oct. 13. It was the 
7th Annual Cindy Lackner 
Memorial Game, and was 
a tough back and forth 
matchup that was decided 
in a thrilling ?nish. The 
Tartans came out on top on 
Scotty Saturday, pulling off 
the win, 17–14. They now 
move to 3–3 overall and 
2–3 in Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference (PAC) play.
The game started out 
slow, with both teams going 
three-and-out and punting 
the ball away. The quarter 
belonged to the defensive 
side of the ball.
After the ?rst quarter 
?nished scoreless, the 
Tartans put together a 
10-play 51-yard drive to 
the get the ?rst points on 
the board. On 3rd down & 
2 yards from the Carnegie 
Mellon 41-yard line, senior 
quarterback Alex Cline 
threw to ?rst-year wide 
receiver Kris Hughes, who 
caught the ball at mid?eld 
and crossed into Bethany 
territory to the 35-yard 
line. The Tartans made it to 
the 16-yard line but stalled, 
resulting in a 33-yard ?eld 
goal by Brandon Nguyen, 
which opened scoring 3–0.
Bethany’s following drive 
ended with an interception 
by sophomore linebacker 
Darian Cohen after the 
ball was tipped by junior 
safety Thomas Polutchko. 
The ball went back to the 
offense, who marched down 
to the Bethany 8-yard line. 
However, the Tartans came 
away with no points after 
a sack resulted in a loss 
of eight yards, and a ?eld 
goal attempt was blocked 
and recovered by Bethany 
and returned at mid-?eld. 
The Bison took advantage 
of the turnover and scored 
a touchdown, making the 
score 7–3.
With 1:10 left to play 
in the ?rst half, the Tartan 
offense returned to the ?eld. 
In the fast-tempo style, all 
plays were pass attempts. 
But like their last drive, the 
Tartans scored no points 
after a strip sack of Cline 
by the aggressive Bethany 
defense. The Tartans 
defense held the Bison for 
the remaining 21 seconds of 
the ?rst half.
Like the ?rst quarter, the 
third quarter began slowly, 
the ?rst points of the second 
half coming in the ?nal 
seconds of the quarter. After 
three drives ending in punts, 
the Tartans retook the lead 
with 1-yard rush from senior 
running back Rory Hubbard.
The score now 10–7, 
the Bison got the ball back 
with ?ve seconds left in the 
third quarter. Transitioning 
into the fourth quarter, 
the Bison were unable to 
respond, and punted the 
ball back to the Tartans after 
a three-and-out.
In two players, the 
Tartans pulled away from 
the Bison. First was a 
23-yard pass from Cline to 
senior halfback Karl Kumm 
along the right sideline to 
the Bethany 45-yard line. A 
false start penalty pushed 
the offense back to mid?eld. 
On 1st & 15, Cline connected 
with Hughes, who ran the 
ball in for the touchdown. 
With the extra point, the 
Tartans extended their lead 
to 17–7.
Later in the quarter, the 
Bison cut the score to 17–14 
with a 11-play 75-yard 
drive that ended with a 
touchdown. With 2:47 left 
to play and a chance to 
come back in the game, the 
Bison attempted an onside 
kick, which was recovered 
by the Tartans. Nursing 
a three-point lead with 
less than three minutes to 
play, the Tartans turned to 
the running game to eat 
up the clock. On 3rd & 1, 
the offense decided to go 
to the air, but the 12-yard 
reception to Kumm ended 
with another turnover, a 
fumble recovered by the 
Bison.
The Bison had 2:23 left 
for one ?nal chance to tie or 
take the lead. The Tartans 
defense, made one ?nal 
stand. On their own 43-yard 
line, the Bison failed to 
convert on 3rd & 14, when 
senior defensive end Long 
Tran broke through the 
offensive line and blocked 
the pass away. On 4th & 
14, a quarterback scramble 
threatened to change the 
momentum of the game, 
but the attempt fell just a 
yard short, turning the ball 
over on downs with 1:06. 
The Tartans took a knee in 
victory formation to close 
out the game.
Despite comparable 
numbers on paper, the real 
difference in the game was 
the Tartans’ ability to ?nish 
drives. The ?nal line had the 
Tartans with 391 yards from 
scrimmage and the Bison 
with 337, and the Bison with 
more offensive plays (73 to 
69) and time of possession 
(31:39 to 28:21).
Cline went 16-for-29 
for 268 yards and threw a 
touchdown. With his 268, 
Cline became Carnegie 
Mellon’s all-time passing 
leader, surpassing the 
previous mark of 5,519 
with his 5,746 career yards. 
Kumm recorded the ?rst 
100-yard receiving game 
after catching six receptions 
for 111 yards. Hughes wasn’t 
far behind with 89 yards 
on just three receptions 
and a touchdown. Hubbard 
led the running game 84 
yards on 22 carries and a 
touchdown, adding 33 yards 
through the air.
After the game, Cline 
spoke with The Tartan about 
the victory, which came 
after two losses to Grove 
City and Waynesburg.
“It was an ugly win, but 
we pulled it out,” Cline said. 
“I think we can use this game 
as a steeping story for the 
rest of the season [and] can 
carry this momentum and 
focus on our next game.”
For his new passing 
record, Cline highlighted his 
team, and how every part of 
the team contributed to his 
5,746 yards (and counting).
“Nothing gets rolling 
without the line blocking 
well and the receivers 
catching the ball,” he said. 
“It’s a great honor but there 
are a lot of unmentioned 
guys that went into it as 
well.”
October baseball: teams move on to pennant races

For many of us 
European soccer fans, 
the international break 
always comes at the worst 
possible time. Regardless of 
what team you personally 
support, the two-week 
hiatus from club football 
seems to always either 
break your team’s rhythm 
or result in key players lost 
to injury. 
For the more prominent 
clubs, the break restarts 
and recycles transfer 
rumors and gossip over 
the players and their lives. 
For the smaller clubs, 
it brings about extreme 
boredom resulting from 
the lack of football activity. 
However, one thing all 
fans, regardless of club, 
can agree on is that we’re 
counting down the days 
until the break is over. To 
keep us distracted from 
the incessant drama or 
the boredom of watching 
Singapore take on Mongolia 
in a friendly, let’s discuss 
some prominent teams’ 
seasons thus far.
We will start by 
examining the two most 
important teams in the 
Bundesliga. First, we have 
last season’s champions 
FC Bayern, who started 
the season well under 
new manager Niko Kova, 
but are winless in the last 
four matches. It will be 
interesting to see how 
they cope with mounting 
pressure on their aging 
squad and their young, 
inexperienced coach. 
Second, we have Borussia 
Dortmund, last season’s 
fourth place holders, who 
also have a new coach. 
BVB started the season 
with a few unimpressive 
draws but have since 
grown accustomed to a 
new playing style, scoring 
three goals or more in each 
of their last three matches. 
We shall see whether they 
can keep this attacking 
?air as they face tougher 
opponents in the coming 
weeks, such as the solidly 
defensive team like Atlético 
Madrid.
Spanish club Atlético 
Madrid started their season 
perfectly with a win in the 
UEFA Super Cup against 
city rivals Real Madrid. 
They went on to stutter 
in their domestic La Liga 
with some draws, losses, 
and extremely narrow 
wins. Recently, they have 
done better, holding last 
season’s Champions League 
winners Real Madrid to a 
nil-nil draw in the Madrid 
derby and beating a 
well-organized Real Betis 
side. Then you have the 
two Spanish European 
giants FC Barcelona and 
Real Madrid. Both teams 
started their domestic 
seasons with straight 
wins followed by draws, a 
good return considering 
the signi?cant rebuilding 
both teams underwent this 
summer. Then, however, 
came disappointing results. 
Real Madrid, with new 
coach Julen Lopetegui and 
in the absence of Cristiano 
Ronaldo, are winless in four 
games. 
FC Barcelona, after 
a summer of multiple 
signings, have one win in 
the past ?ve matches. Over 
the coming weeks, it will be 
interesting for fans to see 
how both teams deal with 
mounting pressure.

The Carnegie Mellon football team tended off a late comeback attempt by the Bethany Colleg Bison to  win 17–14 over Family Weekend.
MATTHEW BENUSA
Assistant Sports Editor
It’s already been an 
extraordinarily eventful 
October for baseball. 
There’s been the ?rst ever 
postseason cycle, a position 
player pitched in a 16–1 
blowout, Aaron Boone 
telling his players the wrong 
start time for a game, and 
that’s all just in the series of 
the eternal rivalry between 
the Yankees and Red Sox. 
The big news outside of 
the games has been the 
threat of legal trouble for 
the Dodgers because of 
their involvement in the 
traf?cking of players from 
Cuba to the States to play 
baseball; but, there is little 
else at the moment, as the 
investigation is ongoing. 
The games are news 
enough, for now.
In the ?rst National 
League Division Series 
between the Milwaukee 
Brewers and Wild Card 
Winner Colorado Rockies, 
the Brewers were able 
to sweep the Rockies by 
scores of 3–2, 4–0, and 6–0. 
Led by strong pitching, the 
Brewers gave up only two 
runs in the series, with both 
coming in a single ninth 
inning. There’s no way the 
Rockies could have won 
the series if 27 of 28 total 
innings were scoreless. 
The star of the series was 
38-year-old journeyman 
catcher Erik Kratz. Kratz 
is the oldest player to start 
in a postseason debut since 
1905, and he went 5-for-8, 
with one run and two runs 
batted in, in the second half 
of the series. With the help 
of the Brewers pitching 
and Kratz, they were able 
to advance to the National 
League Championship 
series, where they face the 
Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Dodgers, who 
made it to the NLCS by 
way of a four-game series 
with the Atlanta Braves, 
have won their third NLDS 
in as many years. In all 
three Dodger wins this 
series, they handedly took 
down the Braves by at 
least three runs. Dodgers 
pitchers Hyun-Jin Ryu 
and the standout Walker 
Buehler began the series 
strong with two quality 
starts and no earned runs 
allowed. However, the 
one Braves win in the 
series did demonstrate 
the future potential of 
their young team. Rookie 
Ronald Acuña Jr. showed 
off his talent for long 
home runs in the Braves’ 
6–5 win by accounting 
for 4 of the 6 runs with a 
grand slam, becoming the 
youngest player to hit one 
in the postseason. But the 
Dodgers easily beat the 
Braves back in Game 4. The 
NLCS began Friday, Oct. 12 
between the Dodgers and 
the Brewers.
In the American League, 
the Houston Astros faced 
off against the Cleveland 
Indians, who ?nished the 
regular season just over 
.500. Coming into the 
series, baseball journalists 
were writing about the 
lack of credentials for the 
Indians — they barely 
won the worst division 
in baseball this year, the 
AL Central. Three games 
later, it was clear that 
every critic was right. In 
the Astros-Indians series, 
the home-run hitting 
talent of the Astros  was 
on display and the Indians’ 
lack of talent showed 
almost everywhere on the 
?eld. Game 3 featured 11 
Astros runs to three for 
the Indians, and in the 
seventh inning, the Astros 
capitalized on two errors by 
Cleveland pitching for three 
runs. The unfortunate part 
for the winner of this series 
is that they will be facing 
the momentum-driven 
winners of a Yankees-Red 
Sox Division Series.
Both the Yankees and 
Red Sox had 100-win 
records coming into the 
postseason, and for the ?rst 
time in 14 years, the storied 
rivalry was renewed in 
October. It can only be good 
for baseball if the most 
intense rivalry in sports is 
rejuvenated. Baseball was 
buzzing for Yankees-Sox 
games, much to the ire of 
the Astros organization 
who lost primetime spots 
throughout the regular 
season and postseason 
so far to the rivalry. But 
we just love to watch two 
teams play great baseball 
with an intense hatred for 
the opponents.
Through the ?rst two 
games, everybody got what 
they wanted in close games, 
great baseball, and a 1–1 
split for the series. The 
third game was building up 
to be a classic. It was, in a 
way, classic. The Red Sox 
put up sixteen runs to a 
single one by the Yankees, 
and Brock Holt completed 
the ?rst postseason cycle 
in history off a two-run 
home run in the ninth 
inning at the hands of posi-
tion player-turned-pitcher, 
Andrew Romine. Game 4 
was a close game, but not 
too close, until two Yankee 
runs crossed the plate in 
the ninth inning. However, 
it wasn’t enough as the Red 
Sox carried the momentum 
from their massive win 
back to Fenway, where 
they controlled all but one 
inning of the ?nal game. 
Now, the Red Sox move on 
to face the reigning World 
Series champion Astros in 
the ALCS, which began on 
Saturday, Oct. 13.

Izzy Sio |  Assistant Pillbox EditorAdvice for Awkward People
Dear Izzy,
I’m super stressed because I’m super sick!! Fall 
in Pittsburgh is great and all (I could do without 
all the rain, though), but the fact that Pittsburgh 
can’t decide whether to be sunny or torrentially 
down-pouring has been frustrating for me and 
my health. Now, I’m left a sniffling mess with 
midterms on the horizon, and I can’t seem to 
conquer it — or worse, I’ll get better and then 
immediately get sick again. Please help!
Sincerely,
Feeling Low, Ugh
Dear FLU,
Ah yes, autumn. The leaves are changing, 
Starbucks is rolling out their Pumpkin Spice 
Lattes, and Mother Nature warns us of winter by 
sending down gusts of wind and buckets of rain 
to Pittsburgh. As someone who was sick for the 
entirety of her first semester at Carnegie Mellon, 
let me impart some wisdom.
Take care of your body, obviously. Eat healthy, 
and stay away from fried food and things with lots 
of sugar. Tea should be one of your closest pals. 
Try to drink decaffeinated tea, because although 
caffeine will keep you up during class, it can mess 
with your system a bit more than usual. Tea is also 
incredibly calming in general — for your systems, 
for your mind — so you can never go wrong with 
drinking tea!
Listen to your body. If your body is telling you 
that it’s tired, or if you’re up late at night and 
falling asleep while doing work, honestly just go 
to sleep. You’ll be thankful in the morning, and no 
assignment is worth pulling an all-nighter for while 
you’re sick and suffering. You’ll have a clearer 
mind to finish it, and if you email your professor 
about your situation they will usually understand.
Most importantly, relax. If you’re sick, put yourself 
first. Relax your mind — watch something on 
Netflix, read a book, take a nap, and feel free 
to take a break from work if you need to. Your 
focus should be to get better, so that you can walk 
into class well-rested and with a clear mind. Your 
professors want you to prioritize getting better too, 
so if you can’t do work, listen to your needs and 
take the time to fulfill them.
Happy flu season,
Izzy
Michelle Madlansacay | Pillbox EditorBrunch Buddies: The Porch
This past Saturday, I decided to take some time for 
myself and go out to brunch. While some people 
may think that eating alone can be a bit sad, I 
think it can be quite comforting. If you like people-
watching, you can surely do a lot of that and also 
give yourself time to just think (and eat!). For this 
brunch outing, I decided to go to The Porch.
The location: The Porch is pretty close to campus, 
which makes it a very convenient spot to eat. What I 
appreciate most about its location, Schenley Plaza, 
is that it looks and feels as if you’re in a completely 
different area of Pittsburgh, even though it’s only a 
15-minute walk from campus. The grass, trees, and 
outdoor seating of the whole area always give me 
good vibes, and I love seeing families and students 
leisurely walking around and enjoying themselves.
The food: In the past I went to The Porch only at 
night, specifically for their amazing weekday half-
off pizza deals! I’ve always loved their pizzas and 
unique toppings, but I also wanted to try mixing 
it up by ordering different things on their menus. 
Going for brunch at The Porch definitely gave me 
the opportunity to do that. I didn’t order anything 
extravagant, but something rather simple and 
balanced in flavors: crispy taters and warm biscuits. 
I was really craving the salty and sweet 
combination, and the meal surely did not disappoint. 
The three biscuits they served were crunchy on the 
outside and very fluffy and buttery on the inside. 
The biscuits came with apple butter, jam, and 
regular butter, so I could have some flavor variety in 
each bite. The crispy taters were crunchy and salty, 
and they were served with a delicious (and mildly 
spicy) curried ketchup on the side. Overall, I found 
my meal to be pretty satisfying and tasty!
The vibe: Because it was family weekend, there were 
lots of families eating at The Porch. It gave off such 
wonderful vibes and feelings to be around people 
who were happy to be there together. In general, 
The Porch is a popular eating location for families 
and elders, so I think the familial and relaxed 
atmosphere is something you can always expect to 
have.
Lit or nah:  I wouldn’t describe The Porch as lit. I’ve 
always seen it as a very family-friendly place to eat 
at, where it’s possible for you to feel even just a little 
bit at home. And that’s obviously not a bad thing! 
Everything at The Porch is simply feel-good, and it’s 
important to visit places like that every once in a 
while.
Go for the food and family friendly atmosphere.

---------------------------------------------------

Pittsburgh Public Theater’s rendition 
of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice 
(adapted by Kate Hamill) is incredibly 
entertaining. Directed by Desdemona 
Chiang, this show captivates its audience 
with a humor-filled, in-the-round, love 
story.
Possibly the most thought-provoking 
directorial choice is that of the casting. 
As this story is typically seen through a 
traditional lens, it is refreshing to witness 
a new take on gender. The plot explores 
the ideals and norms that both women 
and men had in nineteenth century 
England. However, in this version of the 
play, many of the actors are responsible 
for multiple characters, regardless of 
what gender they identify with personally. 
This concept that gender does not 
serve as a primary factor in the casting 
highlights a more modern observation 
and critique of society.
When asked about his experience 
playing multiple characters, Andrew 
Smith, Assistant Professor of Acting for 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama, 
noted that the development of the 
individual characters has to do with how 
that character helps progress the plot 
of other characters, instead of focusing 
on gender. Additionally, there had to 
be an “establishment of a new neutral” 
with each characters’ body positioning 
and how they carry themselves rather 
than the idea of “how to play a female/
male.” While watching the show, it is 
fascinating to notice how, despite some 
men played women and vice versa, 
the characterization choices were so 
deliberate that it never felt as though 
the actors were forcing gender as the 
primary characterization. Andrew also 
commented that his objective in exploring 
the role of Mary was to focus more on 
the relationship her character had with 
4

---------------------------------------------------

pride and
prejudice
others, as opposed to simply “playing 
a woman.” His portrayal of Mary was 
incredibly raw, emotive, and genuine.
Not only were the characters extremely 
fleshed out and well developed, but 
the production also felt collaborative. 
Andrew noted that while there were 
some sections of the play that were 
planned out in terms of comedic 
timing, the majority were created on 
the spot. As an audience member, 
this was enjoyable. The language 
and story were very much comedic, 
and it was entertaining to watch how 
each moment of comedy did not feel 
forced or planned. This is what made 
the production brilliant. Although 
there was a sense of structure shaped 
by directorial choices, many of the 
decisions were left up to the actors 
in regards to the reactions and silent 
actions performed. There were many 
written by Sophie Carpenter | Staffwriter
layout by Tracy Le | Visual Editor
beautiful moments of the production 
with this idea in mind. One enjoyable 
aspect was the relationship between 
Mary and each of her sisters. There is a 
beautiful sense of fluidity that Andrew 
possesses to seamlessly transition from 
one character to another.
Equally as exceptional are the scene 
changes made throughout the play. The 
play is set “in the round,” where the 
audience sits around the stage, so the 
director has to be methodical in how 
each scene is set up. The scenes in a 
production like this have to play to each 
section of the room. The majority of the 
items used for the show are on the stage 
at all times. This makes for a more fluid 
and easy transition between scenes. 
Not only do these set pieces have to be 
carefully placed, but so do the actors.
When speaking about working “in the 
round,” Andrew mentioned that scenes 
needed to be reworked constantly in 
order to make sure that the movements 
being done were justifiable, yet also 
played to every person in the audience. 
He noted that despite having the unique 
experience of working and performing in 
the audience, each actor had to figure 
out “how to share focus across a large 
space,” as this stage is not a typical 
proscenium style. The actors are free 
to move about the audience, as some 
of the set pieces are staged in sections 
of the seating. This directorial choice 
was done with the intention of fully 
enveloping the audience into the story. 
The production overall is incredibly well 
executed and fun to watch. It is engaging 
and true to the story, yet memorable with 
modern twists. It is highly recommended 
as it takes its audience on a fun-filled 
adventure through the world of Jane 
Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.

Way Out West
This article contains mild spoilers for The Way Out West.
The School of Drama kicked off their 2018/19 production season with the play The Way Out 
West. This was a newly commissioned piece for the Philip Chosky Theater written by Carnegie 
Mellon alumni Liza Birkenmeier, and also marked the university’s directorial debut for the newly 
appointed John Wells Professor of Directing, Kim Weild. Set during World War II, the play follows 
the lives of characters at a government test site, as they grapple with the secret development of the 
atomic bomb.

The

---------------------------------------------------

From the opening minutes, it was clear that this wasn’t going 
to be a very traditional play. Throughout the show, the 
set was mostly bare with very few set changes. There’s no 
straight plot either; rather, the point is to watch the play’s 
characters grow and develop over the course of 90 minutes. 
This can make for a challenging watch, but it’s incredibly 
rewarding and will stay with you long after. It’s one of those 
stories that requires a lot of thought before understanding its 
true meaning. The play was also presented without an  
intermission, which seems like a deliberate choice in hind-
sight and one that works very well. The intermission would 
ruin the pace at which the character development unfolds.
Despite the simple production design, it was incredibly 
effective and everything there was very convincing. There 
was a clear sense of space and time despite the barebones 
set presented. This may seem like a backhanded compliment, 
but it only makes sense when you see the play for yourself 
and see nearly nothing on stage. The sound design was also  
incredibly effective, with great use of music and sound 
effects. There was one particular sequence in the program 
where it flashes forward to 1990, and the music used to  
transition to the new time period was incredibly effective.
The actors also deserve praise for pulling off this difficult 
material. The play rests squarely on their ability to pull of 
their written characters really well and with nuance, and 
every cast member pulls off their roles. Special shoutouts go 
to senior drama students Leaf Rickard as Irene and Brenna 
Power as Leona. Their onstage chemistry was an absolute 
treat to watch, and their dynamic and development were 
highlights of the play.
However, the play’s main star was the script. The main con-
flict of the story revolved around the secrecy of the atomic 
bomb’s development and its implication, but for the first 40 
to 45 minutes, the story seemed to be going nowhere. All 
the elements and relationships were established and fleshed 
out early on and while they were all compelling, it left you 
wondering what the point was to everything. But after a few 
significant turning points, the first 40 minutes suddenly fell 
into place. The play was never about the bomb itself, rather 
about how something as morally ambiguous as the atomic 
bomb can strain relationships, since people had disagree-
ments over its meaning and how to use it. Both sides of this 
debate had valid arguments: there is merit to those who 
support a quick and swift end to a war, and there is also 
merit in the argument that the usage of the atomic bomb is 
cruel and lacks the foresight of its long term consequences. It 
is juxtaposed against modern political discourse over drone 
warfare and even against Hindu mythology. It’s a very 
timely parallel to modern politics where families, friendships, 
and relationships have become more tumultuous in an era of 
divisive rhetoric.
Having thought about it for several days, the play has really 
come to grow on me and on many others who have watched 
it. The Way Out West is a thought-provoking triumph, and 
major props should go to everyone for pulling off a play 
like this with such precision and skill. The School of Drama 
is off to a great start so far with its 2018/19 season, and 
if the later selections in their schedule are any indica-
tion, they seem to have a great season lined up for 
everyone to enjoy.

Diwali
On Friday, Oct. 12, CMU OM and Mayur 
SASA put together a wonderful evening to 
celebrate Diwali, the Indian festival of lights. 
The event ran from 6 p.m. - 12 a.m. at Rangos 
Ballroom and showcased musical and dance 
performances alongside traditional activities 
such as painting diyas (candles), and applying 
mehndi. Falling on family weekend, the event 
also saw many parents attend to watch their 
children perform, giving the celebration less of 
a party vibe until the Bollywood music started 
later in the night.
Diwali has several backstories depending on 
the region the festival is celebrated in. North 
India celebrates the festival as the return of 
King Rama to Ayodhya, while South India 
celebrates the festival as the day of the defeat 
of the demon Narakasura by Lord Krishna. 
Diwali is specifically known as the festival 
of lights, as on this day, families light diyas 
(candles) around their houses to symbolize the 
light vanquishing the dark, or good defeat-
ing evil. Where I come from, families also 
celebrate the festival by setting off fireworks 
throughout the night and creating patterns 
called rangoli in front of their homes.

The evening kicked off with people on the dance floor as 
bhangra music blasted over the speakers. Almost everyone was 
wearing their finest Indian attire for the night. Several people, 
myself included, picked up the dandiya sticks to form small 
circles and dance. Tables lined the perimeter of Rangos with 
a mehndi station, a photography station that had a constant 
stream of people, a candle painting station that almost ruined 
my white outfit, and “Lassi Pong,” a twist on the traditional beer 
pong without the latter’s “side-effects.” After I’d finished paint-
ing a little diya, taking several pictures, and trying (but failing) 
at dandiya dancing, the bhangra music came to an end and the 
performances for the evening began.

The performances began with two a cappella groups, CMU Saans and Deewane a cappella. Both groups were 
absolutely amazing, although their mics could have been placed a bit better. Following them were performances 
from three dance groups: CMU Bhangra, Raasta, and Sahara. All three received enthusiastic applause from its audi-
ence, and their energy was captivating to say the least. During the performances, people also enjoyed the Indian 
buffet that had been laid out, which was covered as part of the admission ticket cost.
After the night’s performances came to an end, the parents in the room drifted off to their hotel rooms as the 
Bollywood music began to play over the speakers. Maybe it was because it was a Friday night and it was a long 
week after midterms, but the room filled with unleashed energy that literally had the floors vibrating.  As a Tamilian, 
I was a bit miffed that the night’s playlist mainly consisted of Hindi songs but those small complaints faded to mist as 
the night progressed. Everyone was excited, everyone let loose, and the enthusiasm was hard to avoid. The evening 
ended on a high note that had people tired and drained, with huge smiles lighting up their faces.

Vertigo, the highly anticipated fall a cappella concert, returned to Rangos 
Ballroom this past Saturday, Oct. 13. Hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s 
renowned a capella group, the Originals, the event showcased the talents 
of five collegiate a cappella groups: the Nor’easters from Northeastern 
University, the Boston University Treblemakers, the Vibes from George 
Washington University, 
Gestalt from the University 
of Florida, and of course, 
the Originals from Carnegie 
Mellon.
After the success of Vertigo 
last year, it was no surprise 
that the show sold out by 
early afternoon. Starting at 
7, I was fortunate enough 
to know to come early to 
get a good seat, as there 
was already a line forming 
outside the ballroom half 
an hour before the show 
started.
Once everyone was settled 
in, the Originals kicked off 
the show with “Judas” by 
Lady Gaga. The lead singer commanded the stage and the rest of the all-
male group followed his lead. The soloist’s voice was perfect for the song, 
managing to hit all the notes and incorporating strong personality into 
everything he did. However, the energy fizzled out a bit when it got to the 
duet between the vocal percussionists. Not that the beat-boxing was bad 
by any means, but there was not much variety in their performance.
Next up was University of Florida’s co-ed Gestalt, hoping to “break the 
mold of contemporary a cappella.” They started strong with a haunting 
and ethereal harmony that led into Calvin Harris’ “Pray to God” featuring 
Haim. The lead vocalist had a powerful and unique voice, but when trying 
to share the spotlight with the other female singers, it became overwhelm-
ing, and not in a good way. While they 
all were extremely talented, they did not 
always have good control of their volume 
and they ended up singing over each 
other several times. They proceeded with 
“Mother” by Florence + the Machine. The 
male lead had a very deep, soothing voice, 
but for the most part, they allowed the 
female singers to take center stage again. 
Although there were a few times where I 
felt the vocals overlapped again, it was still 
a strong performance and they continued 
to excel with well-structured choreography. 
Gestalt continued with three more songs: 
“Selah” by Emeli Sandé, which showed 
their incredible vocal range and more 
successfully balanced the light and heavy 
moments; “Trainwreck” by Banks, which 
they do not normally perform live but 
displayed their widest vocal ranges; and 
“Feel” by Bombay Bicycle Club, which had 
a nice echo effect and continued their theme of rather haunting-sounding 
vocals. The last of these was probably their best vocal performance of the 
night, but definitely had the most obscure choreography. Overall though, 
Gestalt proved they had talent despite being a group only formed two 
years ago.

---------------------------------------------------

Following Gestalt was the Vibes from George Washington University. 
Starting with Michael Jackson’s iconic “Rock with You,” I could instantly 
tell the group was having a good time as the lead vocalist bopped 
around on the stage. While her singing wasn’t the greatest, she definitely 
was upbeat and kept the mood light and fun before the following per-
formance that took on more serious tones. The group tackled themes of 
mental health and depression in a melancholy but beautiful mashup of 
Jon Bellion’s “Guillotine” and Logic’s “1-800-273-8255.” After this, they 
closed with a solid performance of Brayton Bowman’s “FEEL YOU.”
After a brief intermission, Northeastern University’s Nor’easters brought 
the audience back into the show with an accurate arrangement of Dua 
Lipa’s hit song, “New Rules.” Then they debuted their arrangement of 
Troye Sivan’s “Plum,” which 
I controversially enjoyed 
a bit more than the origi-
nal despite being a fan of 
Sivan’s music. It seemed 
more natural an approach 
for the lyrics compared to 
Sivan’s more upbeat ver-
sion. Next was Rosie Lowe’s 
“Who’s That Girl?” that 
included superb synchro-
nized choreography, and 
interesting clapping and 
breathing patterns that 
added a unique effect to the 
whole vibe of the song. The 
females took over for this 
song, but there was a good 
vocal balance so that they 
complemented each other 
instead of overpowering one 
another. Last was a poignant 
and mesmerizing rendition of 
MUNA’s “I Got a Place.”
The penultimate group that took the stage was Boston University’s 
Treblemakers. Starting strong, they began with “How Long” by Charlie 
Puth. Arranged as a duet rather than a solo, it really amplified the emo-
tions of the piece, although the two vocalists were better when their parts 
were separate rather than harmonizing. Their next two songs, Sam Smith’s 
“Him” and Jorja Smith’s “So Lonely,” were equally emotional and pure, 
with strong vocals from their respective leads. Closing with “Keeping Your 
Head Up” by Birdy, they ended formidably with a vocalist that could hit 
all the notes, even when they went extremely high or when she had to 
compete with her loud groupmates’ backing vocals.
To finish the night, the Originals took the stage once more. Unfortunately, 
they had a problem with one of the mics in the first set, but, per the audi-
ence’s approval, they were granted another chance to perform “Judas.” 
This second run did not disappoint. The lead once again commanded the 
stage, but was even more energetic and added even more dramatic flair 
than before with his dance moves. They definitely took the extra opportu-
nity and ran with it. Not only was the singing and backing vocals stronger, 
but the group overall was more energetic and was visually enjoying them-
selves more. To top it off, there 
was an extreme difference in the 
additional mic during the duet, 
the effects much more diverse 
and dynamic.
After their redo of “Judas,” 
they performed Daniel Caesar’s 
“Won’t Live Here,” which con-
tinued all the groups’ trends of 
having at least one song with 
gorgeously haunting vocals. 
In addition to the emotional 
and raw singing, the Originals 
stepped up their game when it 
came to choreography as well. 
I honestly felt like I was being 
hypnotized, even when they 
were doing something as simple 
as swaying on stage.
Last, but certainly not least, 
the Originals took on a chal-
lenge with Panic! At the Disco’s 
“Death of a Bachelor.” With the strongest choreography and posing of the 
night from the very start of the song, I was excited to see what they had 
in store for the finale. While I thought the lead was a bit pitchy during the 
chorus, overall he took on Brendon Urie’s vocals with grace and poise.
In the end, Vertigo was a massive success once more, bringing together a 
cappella groups from across the country to thrill audiences.

BAND AIDS DON’T FIX 
BULLET HOLES:
written by Catherine Taipe | Junior Staffwriter
art by Parmita Bawankule | Staff Artist
It feels like just yesterday when “Teardrops On My Guitar” was blasting from my desktop computer while I did math homework, when I listened to 
“White Horse” while thinking about my fourth grade crush, when I listened to “22” while daydreaming of being older and cooler, and when I lis-
tened to “You Belong With Me” while sleeping through a long road trip. For a chunk of my childhood, your music was the background noise in my 
life — even if I didn’t exactly show off my secret love of early 2000s country.
It also feels like just yesterday when I was fourteen, phone in hand, scrolling through articles and writing pieces about culture, social justice, and civic 
action. The obvious issues with our country were suddenly very apparent to me, and I chose to act in a way only a fourteen-year-old could: tweet, 
retweet, share, like, and tell friends. I was a freshman in high school and a passionate feminist, taking glares and snarky comments from boys and 
girls alike. I persisted nonetheless, because standing up for what I believed in mattered a tiny bit more than my reputation.
At the same time of this dynamic moment in my life, 1989 came out. Was I mad that the country sound was completely gone? A little. However, 
you soon announced your feminism and spoke of 1989 as a women’s anthem: “Blank Space” embraced a woman’s revenge on an ex-lover and her 
“serial-dating,” while “Bad Blood” exemplified the girl group “squad goals” ideal. I remember thinking, “Hell yeah,” because my childhood idol was 
growing and learning with me — and it felt amazing!
Flash forward a few months, and you are on my Twitter timeline for other reasons. First, most evidently, hordes of people hated you for having “so 
many” failed relationships — which was really wrong and honestly gross. Second, a smaller population of people began to call you out for “white 
feminism.” I was confused. Were they being stereotypical by labeling you, a white woman, as a white feminist? But then I realized what it meant: it 
meant you were a feminist that fought for cisgender, mostly white, straight, and able-bodied women.
That confused me and I disagreed with the sentiment immediately. Yet with the release of the “Shake It Off” and “Wildest Dreams” music videos, I 
began to feel wary. “Shake It Off,” while a somewhat catchy song, was sour with racial appropriation and the objectification of black women. And 
who even knows what the “Wildest Dreams” music video was, and why it was that way! Nowhere in the song’s lyrics do I hear “Africa as a back-
drop,” “1950s Hollywood,” “colonial-era aesthetics for no apparent reason,” or “specifically choosing to not share any African storyline, let alone 
cast any African person.” I realize the profits of the video were donated to an African Wildlife Conservation organization, but still. Why did the 
video have to be about…that?
Finally, to top off the cake that was 2014-to-2015, you dismissed Nicki Minaj’s valid statements about the disadvantages of being a black woman in 
the industry when she lost the Video Music Award for Best Music Video of the Year as “pitting women against each other.” Why couldn’t you just let 
her say what she had to? You did win the award in the end.
So, I chose to ignore you completely. I figured there was no point in actively calling you out, but there was absolutely no benefit in promoting you 
either. I focused my energy into other things, and eventually 2016 rolled around. Anger, frustration, and disappointment plagued me — and over half 
of the nation — when our current president was elected. But I was not surprised when I heard your silence. I heard your silence on the issues that 
were affecting black Americans, Latin Americans, immigrants, refugees, the LGBTQ community, and anyone who wasn’t white. When I realized the 
art of your selective activism, I felt betrayed by someone I once looked up to. And, I knew that even if you were to speak up, I would still see you as 
someone who ultimately chose her own reputation over standing up for what’s right, let alone standing up for anything.
It feels like just yesterday when my Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat feeds were overloaded with the headline, “Taylor Swift Finally Ends 
Her Political Silence.”
That was just yesterday. And honestly, I wish it was a lot sooner.
Lots of Love,
A Former Fan
Dear Taylor Swift,
a letter to America’s sweetheart

Jeremy Zucker was not your average college student. While pursuing a pre-med track and studying molecular and cellular biology at Colorado College, he 
also began his music career.
It doesn’t take long to get sucked into Zucker’s smooth voice and groovy beats. Tossing playful lyrics and merging indie electronica with notes of hip-hop, he 
creates tunes that many people can enjoy and relate to. Listening to his music is not only a pleasant auditory experience, but it gives the comfort of being 
with a longtime best friend whom you share all your life experiences with.
Coincidentally, singer-songwriter Mat Musso, known professionally as Blackbear, was what brought both Zucker and me towards Zucker’s music. In his high 
school years, Zucker heard Blackbear’s track, “‘Hotel Andrea,’ [which] he says grabbed his heart and revealed an array of feelings to him that he didn’t 
previously know were there,” he said in an interview with Earmilk. Like Blackbear, Zucker’s music is mellow and influenced by hip-hop. Zucker’s music also 
echoes the music of other artists he looked up to such as Bon Iver and Twenty One Pilots.
In an interview with Billboard earlier this month, he reported his favorite album is currently Macadelic by Mac Miller. “[Miller] was looked at as the super 
happy... frat rapper, and I think I relate to people looking at you that way because my early music was really happy,” he reflects, claiming Macadelic 
“changed the way [he] listened to music.”
This change in music tastes is shown in perhaps his most striking song, “all the kids are depressed.” In the introduction of the video, Zucker explains that 
before he began the actual video production, Zucker put out a casting call for the music video, “asking friends and strangers to share their experiences with 
depression.” In three weeks, he received hundreds of emails from people all around the world. He closes off the introduction by hoping that his video gives 
others a voice. In the music video, he shared six testimonies, one of which was his own. Each gave a unique perspective on how depression impacts different 
people. For some, their experience stems from events pertaining to their parents. Others share them coping with depression on a daily basis. Zucker ends 
the music video with his own. “[This song was] something I wrote the other day and it reminded me why I make music,” he puts at the end of the music video 
before he closes it with a list of mental health resources.
Mental health has definitely been made more aware in the public eye over the past years. Although the world has moved past trephination, there is still 
significantly more work to be done in regards to removing the stigma surrounding mental health and making mental health resources more accessible. On 
lyrics website Genius, Zucker explains that “a lot of people refuse to legitimize depression in real life and on social media. The reality is that everyone has 
some sort of relationship with depression and that no two people experience it in the same way. I really think that kids these days are the first generation to 
address mental illness in a constructive manner. Listen to the kids, bro.”
In the span of three years, Zucker managed to rack up over 180,000 subscribers on YouTube and over five million monthly listeners on Spotify. Now that 
he has graduated from college, he expects to be able to invest more in his music career. While juggling school, he managed to write and produce music; he 
even managed to collaborate with Blackbear in his song “talk is overrated.” If his success up until now landed him on Billboard’s “You Should Know,” I
cannot wait to see what lies ahead for this indie artist in the future.

Dying Wish of a 
College Sex Educator:
an interview with Maria Falzone
He said, she said; she remembers, he claims he doesn’t.
But the conversation no one is having openly is about sex and sexuality. We’ve heard about sex, sure, accompanied by the frequent “Don’t 
have it.” They preach abstinence. But Maria Falzone, who I recently had the opportunity to talk with, says otherwise.
“Education needs to start in the home,” she explains, “at infancy.”
Maria Falzone, comedian and real talk pioneer, has traveled across America reaching thousands of college students with her performance, 
“Sex Rules.” She invites open--and hilarious--discourse regarding our bodies, sexual health, and consent.
“It’s only sex,” she asserts. “And it’s only weird and awkward because parents make it weird and awkward.”
But knowledge about sex is power, and guardians are not only nurturers but educators. She recalls changing her daughter’s diaper, narrating, 
“Mommy’s touching your vulva.”
Falzone encourages exploration and discourse that ultimately leaves “the lights on, sheets off, and communication about why, when, and how 
you want it.” Such conversations are nonexclusive to those offering support to Ford or to those backing Kavanaugh. Sex is bipartisan, sex is 
universal. But conversations about sex — and consent — aren’t going to be generated in the White House.
A couple months ago, Falzone was diagnosed with cancer and shared that she had, at best, four to six months left to live. What’s left for us 
to do now is to “take on, full force, the stigmas of sex and sexuality.”
Stigmas — those of being LGBTQ, of being female, of being people of color, of being “captain of the football team, of having big breasts, 
of having small breasts” —- plague our conceptions of sex. The general assumption is that sex occurs between two individuals who love each 
other, but even that, Falzone comments, isn’t necessarily true. And then there are “conservative Christians who make assumptions about those 
sexually active outside of wedlock, and liberals who judge decisions to abstain.”
As Kavanaugh takes his seat in the Supreme Court and Falzone shares her last utterances of “Sex Rules,” we must listen. Hear not that rapists 
can be Supreme Court justices, but rather, that kids need to be familiarized with their bodies and with this concept of sex. Healthy,
consensual, communicative sex.
“Raise bad girls and bad boys,” Falzone proclaims, because bad girls and bad boys know how and when to say “NO,” and in their lack of 
complacence, people need to start listening. I hope Kavanaugh is, and if not, well, catch you at midterms.
