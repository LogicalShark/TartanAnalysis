This year’s Junior Prom which will 
be held Friday night, February 16th, 
at the Hotel Schenley, will be one of 
the bright spots in “Carnegie’s” social 
life for the year 1911-12., A standard 
of social entertainment will be set, 
which future Junior classes will find 
difficult to duplicate. The entire 
Schenley banqueting department has 
been engaged for the Prom. Those 
students who have the privilege of at­
tending this function will find a com­
plete change in this part of the hotel. 
The banqueting department consists 
of foyer, ballroom and supper room, 
together with private entrance which 
isolates this set of rooms from the 
public lobby. This arrangement is 
ideal for exclusive social events, such 
as the Carnegie Prom. The interior 
treatment of the new enlarged ball­
room and foyer is beautiful and repre­
sents the best of the interior decora­
tor’s skill.
One of many features of this year’s 
affair will be a dainty Ritz-Carlton 
supper served in true Ritz-Car|ton 
style. The committee has engeaged 
the first orchestra of one of the lead­
ing musicians of the city to furnish 
music for the dancing. Programs have 
been selected which are novel in the 
extreme and are sure to gain favor 
of the fairer sex. The committee is 
incurring considerable expense and it 
deserves the support of every man 
eligible to attend.
The few Junior Science men who 
have neglected to turn in their dollar 
assessment to the class treasurer are 
requested by the committee to do so 
at once, as the assessment was due 
January 5th. .The committee is en­
thusiastic over the interest which is 
being shown by the students in this 
one big event of the four school years. 
The success of the affair is assured 
and the class of 1913 is out to make 
history. .

The January meeting of the Civil 
Engineering Society will take place 
Saturday evening, January 13, at 8 
o’clock, in Room 55.
Action must be taken upon the re­
lation of the C. E. Society to the 
“Federated Engineering Societies of 
the C. T. S.” That this may be done 
intelligently each member should fam­
iliarize himself with the conditions 
under which the Federated Society is 
formed. A list of said conditions are 
posted in the Senior Drawing Room. 
Get busy.

With guards placed at the doors 
to watch warlike Freshmen, the Soph­
omore Class of the School of Applied 
Science held its annual banquet in the 
Hotel Henry Friday night. There 
were fifty present, including Prof. 
Trinks as guest; due to diverse rea­
sons other faculty members could not 
be present.
Between the different courses many 
songs were sung, the music being fur­
nished by Carlisle, Scott, Smith 
Pickering and Trinks. The banquet 
was followed by interesting speeches, 
Carlisle acting as toastmaster.
A few sidelights on Cook’s trip to 
the pole by Prof. Trinks. Walkover 
shoes were used to get to the pole 
over the latitudes. The sleds were 
balled up in the meridians. The cold 
was so severe that hot water was 
froze so quickly that the ice was still 
hot. These were followed by an in­
teresting talk on engineering educa­
tion abroad. The course consists of 
three years’ study and one year of 
practical experience, under the col­
lege supervision. He would like to 
see Sophs put in one year of practical 
work between the Soph and Junior 
years, for it is claimed so many men 
are sent rather than go to college. 
He advises getting down to working 
man’s education. In Germany a man 
cannot be an engineer without a ca­
pacity for two gallons of beer daily, 
and they enjoy academic liberty. The 
exams only occur every two years and 
last for two weeks. The students are 
obliged to dress in full dress suits and 
silk hats for the exams. He says, al­
though we think we have it hard, they 
work harder abroad.
Among the other speakers were: 
Albert Wood on “Unadulterated Ath­
letics,” William Miller on “Things in 
General,” and L. C. Fogg on “What 
is a Red Light?”

In the coming semester new cours­
es will be offered in' the Department 
of Mechanical Engineering, namely a 
minor course in “Pumping and Com­
pressing Machinery” for the students 
of departments other than Mechan­
ical Engineering, and a course in “Re­
frigeration” for Chemical Engineers. 
The instructors will be Prof. W. 
Trinks and Mr. H. J. Macintire, re­
spectively.

While a large number of us were 
using the Christmas holidays to rest 
and enjoy a good loaf, one man con­
nected with the schools was very 
much on the jump in our behalf.
That man was Dr. Watson L. Sav­
age, supervisor of athletics, who rep­
resented these schools at the annual 
meetings of three important athletic 
organizations in New York on De­
cember 28 and 29.
The “big meeting” was that of the 
National Collegiate Athletic Associa­
tion at the Hotel Astor on both of the 
above dates. This association is made 
up of ninety-three colleges and uni­
versities in almost all parts of the 
United States. Yale, Princeton and 
Cornell are the only colleges of any 
importance in the East that are not 
allied with the association. The entire 
country is divided into eight districts, 
the colleges of each being guided by 
the same general regulations and hav­
ing one representative on the Gen­
eral Committee. Dr. Savage was 
elected representative for the Second 
District, which includes New York, 
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and West 
Virginia.
At the two meetings of the associa­
tion, the main subjects for discussion 
were the football rules and summer 
baseball. In regard to the former, 
the association expressed itself in 
favor of the 1911 rules and the open 
game, and suggested that their Rules 
Committee make only such changes 
as will extend the open style of play. 
They also suggested that the football 
rules be published not later than May 
30 in order that officials and players 
may become familiar with the same 
before the beginning of the season.
Considerable feeling was expressed 
on the second day when the subject of 
summer baseball was broached. After 
some hot discussion, the association 
adopted a resolution to be presented 
to the governing bodies of athletics 
in the various colleges. This resolu­
tion aims to eliminate summer base­
ball by appealing to the honor of the 
college students; to show that college 
athletics should be maintained on a 
strictly amateur basis; and to recom­
mend that students participating in 
professional games be barred from 
inter-collegiate contests, but allowed 
to take part in inter-class and similar 
games.
The Society of Directors of Physi­
cal Education in Colleges held their 
meeting at Columbia University. Sub­
jects of interest were discussed, 
among them being that of the “train­
ing table.” The general opinion 
seemed to be that such an institution

On Saturday night the Carnegie 
Varsity team won the second game of 
their schedule when they defeated the 
strong Ex-Varsity team by the score 
of 33 to 28.
Among the old players were Saun­
ders, J. Williams and Jordan, of last 
year’s team, while such stars as Ral­
ston, Lytle, Harrison and Leety also 
participated in the game. The Ex- 
Varsity took the lead after the first 
few minutes of play and kept it all 
through the first half, which ended 16 
to 9. Captain Williams played well 
for the Varsity, while Leety and Har­
rison starred for the old-timers.
In the second half, the leaders made 
numerous substitutions, but the ex­
cellent condition of the regulars pre­
vailed and they took the lead in the 
last few minutes of play. Hall and 
Colvin did excellent work in this peri­
od for the winners, while Ralston and 
Saunders also starred. There ^as a 
tendency to “rough it up” on the part 
of some of the “old-timers,” but Dr. 
Marks kept his eye on it all. ,
After the game a short dance wras 
held, the Carnegie band furnishing 
the music.

Manager Blair announces two good 
games for the coming week. The first 
game on Thursday, January 11th, at 
Pittsburgh Athletic Association will 
afford many students a chance to 
visit this magnificant building and see 
a number of ex-college stars in action. 
On Tuesday, January 16th, the Gen­
eva College team will be played at the 
Field House. Student tickets will be 
honored at both games.

Those of us who have been fortu­
nate enough to form early in life the 
weekly habit of reading LIFE will 
remember how, about a year ago, we 
were all kept on edge by the an­
nouncement that an Improper Num­
ber of our favorite laugh-provoker 
was to be issued at a certain date. 
Well indeed do we remember how we 
read for the first time, with sobering 
faces that the issue had been post­
poned. However, as this postponing 
proposition was continued to such 
length, it became the unanimous be­
lief that the Honorable Editors did 
not have the face to do the dastardly 
deed. But remember this, kind and 
gentle reader, it came at last. So will 
the Senior Number .
Now, not for a minute would we 
think of comparing, the Senior Num­
ber of The Tartan with the Improper 
Number of LIFE. No, not for even 
the wee bit of a second could we do 
such a thing and moreover we do not 
want you to fall into that error. While 
we must again announce that the Sen­
ior Number has been postponed, we 
hasten to tell you, with one and the 
same breath, that it will come, that 
the first week after Inspection Week 
will it come with all its glories. Be 
sure to be on hand early to obtain 
your copy as the intense interest dis­
played in this gigantic undertaking 
promises to exhaust the issue before 
all wants have been satisfied. Watch 
for it. It will appear promptly at 
twelve o’clock noon on the fifteenth 
of February, in the year of Our Lord 
One Thousand Nine Hundred and 
Twelve.

The Tartan desires to call attention 
to the article appearing elsewhere in 
this issue concerning the publication 
in a national magazine of an article 
misleading in character. Such occur­
rences are far too common and we 
have all seen instances of the lengths
to which some magazines will go in 
the twisting of facts in order to ob­
tain a sensational story. In regard to 
this article there can be no question 
as to the fraud. It was written, placed 
in a prominent place in the magazine, 
announced on the cover, all in order 
to create a sensation and help sell 
that particular issue of the magazine 
in which it appeared. Such practices 
are absolutely unscrupulous and are 
the outcome of trying to introduce 
into the realm of science the meth­
ods of yellow journalism. Any such 
attempts should be exposed by those 
capable of so doing, the trained man, 
not on account of the harm they will 
NOT do the class of readers so 
trained, but on account of the harm 
they WILL and DO do to the un­
trained lay readers.
The Tartan desires to thank those 
who first called attention to this par­
ticular article. It furnishes a very ex­
cellent opportunity to bring this ques­
tion of perverted journalism before 
the student-body and The Tartan is 
very glad indeed to avail itself of the 
chance so offered.---------o---------

In looking over the records the 
other day, we find that the former 
Editors and Business Managers of the 
Tartan have scattered to various parts 
of this little round ball and that only 
one of them was still in the profes­
sion of journalism. Foster and Samp­
son, the founders of The Tartan, are 
more widely separated now than they 
ever were while in Tech. Foster is
a superintendent of a Mexican rail­
road, while Sampson is located with 
the McConway-Torley Company, of 
this city. Gaston, who succeeded Fos­
ter as Editor, is with the Jones & 
Lauglin Company, of this city, while 
Roura, who was Business Manager 
with Gaston, is with the American 
Sheet and Tin Plate Company, at 
Gary, Ind. Nicols, who followed Gas­
ton as Editor, is the only one still 
earning his way with his pen. He is 
with McClure’s Magazine, in New 
York, as art editor. McCorkle is, as 
we all know, with his Alma Mater as 
assistant to Dean Leete. Theron 
Wasson, who had the distinction of 
editing two editions in the year of 1910 
is working for the State of New Jer­
sey. E. B. Taggart, Associate Editor 
under Nicols, is mining engineer with 
the Blair Limestone Company and is 
located in Martinsburg, West Vir­
ginia.

Last Thursady evening Professor 
D. C. Miller, of Case School of Ap- 
lied Science, during a lecture before 
the Academy of Science and Art in 
the lecture hall of Carnegie Institute, 
threw by means of an invention of his 
own, he calls it the “phonodeik,” sound 
waves upon a screen, making them 
visible to all the audience. This was 
said to be the first time that the new 
model of the machine has been shown 
in public and it certainly interested 
intensely the large gathering. Even 
the applause of the audience was 
thrown on the screen by this rather 
wonderful invention, it making itself 
apparent in waves that rose and re­
ceded with sound. The notes of va­
rious instruments were also shown 
dancing across the curtain.
The phonodeik, which projects upon 
a screen “living” sound waves, con­
sists, briefly, of a receiving horn and 
a very thin disc. Attached to the 
disc is a very fine platinum wire one- 
half of on-thousanths of an inch in 
diameter which in turn passes over a 
light pulley mounted upon jewels and 
which carries a weight hung by a 
spring to keep the tension constant. 
When a sound enters the receiving 
horn it will vibrate the disc, which 
in turn causes the wire to move back­
ward and forward over the pulley. 
Attached to the pulley is also a mirror 
which, in its movements with the wire, 
reflects a beam of light on to a motor 
driven, revolving mirror. The waves 
of light thus produced are cast upon 
a screen. The apparatus is so sensi­
tive that component parts of a sound 
can be shown. With it Professor Mil­
ler showed that a metal flute has more 
resonance than a wooden instrument; 
that the instrument with the greatest 
tone quality is a slide trombone; and 
that a bell has more composite quali­
ties than any instrument but the hu­
man voice.
Professor Miller stated that his 
experiments will continue over 
many years and that, while they were 
purely scientific, some practical good 
might come of them in as much as the 
picturing of the sounds of different in­
struments showed up their faults and 
efforts could be made to rectify them.

Following the monthly election of 
officers, the board of directors of the 
Civil Junior Class had a very enjoy­
able theatre party at the Harris thea­
tre last Friday night. The board met 
in front of the First Church, and pro­
ceeded in a body to the theatre, where 
the president, Mr. R. S. Dornberger, 
was the host of the evening. Re­
freshments were later had at Piatts 
and Reymers.
Owing to several errors being found 
in Mr. Maurice Stubnitz’s work, he 
was deposed from the presidency, and 
Mr. Dornberger elected in his place. 
Mr. Arthur E. Vail was elected vice 
president, and Mr. Earl M. Stewart 
was elected chief computer to succeed 
Mr, Leonard Bergman.

Miss Harriet Ellis, graduate of the
1909 Household Arts Class, is now 
in Hodge, Georgia. She thepe pur­
chased a bungalow which was built
by a small social club as a tea-room 
or rest place for automobilists.
It is a square building with sloping 
roof and is surronunded by wide 
porches which are enclosed with wire 
netting.
Miss Ellis has with her a friend or 
companion, a cook, and butler. She 
also has some stock which consists 
of a “hired” cow, some pigs and chick­
ens.
She serves afternoon tea and chick­
en suppers. And a quaint little lan­
tern hangs on a tree in front of the 
bungalow to direct the travelers to 
the “Hitching Post,” which is the 
name of this charming little stopping 
place.
This is a new venture for one of 
the charter class and we wish her all 
success.

These are delightful days, nice and 
cold with the water pipes all frozen 
up, the heating system refusing to do 
its duty to the entire satisfaction of 
all concerned, and news scarcer than 
hens’ teeth a sour good and much 
slandered friend Mr. C. C. Leeds 
would be likely to say should he be 
required to hunt some. Fine indeed, 
and the cheering thought that the 
mid-year exams, are but two weeks 
off adds much to the zest of the situ­
ation. It was on just such a day last 
week, one of the days when every per­
son crossing the bridge had the oppor­
tunity to frost his ears, that a lonely 
Tartan reporter started out on his 
weekly hunt for news, real news pre­
ferred, but most any kind taken. 
Gunning was poor and although he 
worked long and strenuously, even 
going to the extent of offering the 
telephone central bribes for the slight­
est trace of a story, no news could be 
found but the results of many inter­
views were carefully written down 
verbatim. Thinking that the vicissi­
tudes of such a life might interest the 
attentive readers of The Tartan, we 
give them below.
The first person interviewed was 
Mr. Tarbell, who is, as we all know, 
and as is stated in the catalogue, the 
Registrar of this noble institution. He 
was standing in the hall in front of 
his office door, overcoat and hat on. 
Before he had a chance to get away 
he was collared by the reporter and 
asked:
“What is the news? Can’t you give 
me something for publication this 
week?”
“Not a line, sir; not a line. Steam 
pipes all frozen.”
Now, while we appreciated the fact 
that Mr. Tarbell was there, as the 
boys say, we did not credit him with 
being a steam engine. Wondering 
much about this, we went to the office 
of the Honorable Secretary, only to 
find that he had departed for lunch. 
Such is life (we had not had ours). 
Better success awaited us in the of­
fice of the Dean of the School of Ap­
plied Industries. Dean Connelley ex­
pressed his willingness to talk to any 
length upon the weather, if we so de­
sired, but could tell us of nothing 
else. The weather being such a pain­
ful subject just then that it was by 
mutual consent that it was given a 
pass out check.
Knowing that William P. Field, 
Esq., Secretary of the Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology, had gone to 
lunch in the Commons we knew that 
he would not be long in returning to 
his office and so sat ourselves down 
to rest. When entering with his usual 
dash he saw us seated, as close the 
steam coil as possible, he remarked: 
“You here?”
We did our best to assure him that 
we were and told him what we de­
sired. With a laugh he retreated to 
his inner office, flinging back at us 
over his shoulder:
“What on, the Faculty Spring Golf
Tournament?”
Foiled again, but not daunted. We 
dashed into the first opening without 
noticing where we are going and stop, 
aghast, in the presence of that im 
portant personage, CENTRAL.
“Do-o, DO you know any news,” 
we manage to murmur.
“No. Line busy.” And we retreat 
backwardly out the door.
Desperate now, we take a tight hold 
on our few remaining pennies and 
dare a visit to the Bursar.
“Have you any news?”
“Lots of it.”
Much cheered we open our note 
book and pick out our sharpest pen­
cil.
“You know, I suppose,” continues 
THE BUSBAR, “all about that 
wooden wedding, about the two Poles 
getting married.”
As we fall faintingly out into the 
corridor we hear the genial extracter- 
of-coin-of-the-realm-from - defenseless 
students telling another to the effect 
that a touring car should always be 
called he because it is not a run­
about.
Dean Leete is out when we call at 
his office, but his assistant, Mr. Mc- 
Corkle, invites us in. When asked 
for an item or. two, Mr. McCorkle 
remarks:
“Well, I can tell you this much. 
This kind of weather is nothing like 
that in God’s country.” This is, we 
find, only an opening to a lecture 
of indefinite length on Texas, from 
which part of the* country we take 
Mr. McCorkle hails from. Breaking 
away from such a subject of conver 
sation we meet Mr. Leeds in the cor 
ridor.
“I will say nothing, absolutely 
nothing, to a paper that has slandered 
me in such a manner as has The Tar­
tan,” remarks our very good friend. 
“Gee, I’ll bet you a farm in Massachu­
setts that news is scarcer than hens’ 
teeth.”
And he wins. It is.

Quite a little comment has been 
aroused by the Thistle notice on the 
bulletin boards, showing the distri­
bution of the work. This was done 
so that each student could see just 
how the work is organized and who 
is responsible for the publication of 
the various articles.
Several members of the various 
classes availed themselves of the in­
vitation of the Thistle Board to at­
tend the meetings and see just how 
the work was done, as well as to offer 
several timely suggestions. The mem­
bers of the present Sophomore Class­
es are most cordially welcome as they 
will thus get some insight into the 
work scheduled for them next year.

CARNEGIE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS : PITTSBURGH
T
^HE Carnegie Technical Schools consist of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied Science—Offers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied Design—Offers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied Industries—Offers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, electrical 
equipment and installation, and training for industrial 
teachers. Short courses of eight months are offered in 
machine shop, pattern making, mechanical drawing, 
electric wiring, plumbing, foundry, forging and brick­
laying for more mature applicants who have had some ex­
perience in these trades.
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School—For women only. 
Offers a regular course embracing two years of general 
training, with particular emphasis on home—making, 
followed by a year of vocational training in household 
economics, secretarial work, dressmaking, or costume 
illustration and design.
Night Courses—The four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.

In November number of “The Tech­
nical World,” a magazine widely read 
by mechanics generally, there appear­
ed an articlee entitled, “GRAVITY 
CONQUERED AT LAST?” This 
article was noticed and read by Pro­
fessor Hower with a good deal of 
interest, to say the least, and the ab­
solutely misleading statements so 
aroused his feelings that he called the 
attention of The Tartan to the ar­
ticle. In an interview with the Tar­
tan reporter Professor Hower said: 
“The publishing of such absolutely 
and intentionally misleading state­
ments in a national magazine, one that 
is widely read by mechanics and peo­
ple of that sort, always makes me 
very angry. It is not fair to science 
and scientists and while any one at all 
versed will recognize the fraud at 
once, the general readers will, upon 
reading such an article, take it in 
all seriousness and will believe it. 
What else can they do, appearing as 
it does in a magazine intended to 
place matters of interest in the tech­
nical world before lay readers. Look 
at that editorial note at the begin­
ning of the article. Despite the fact 
that the editors have nerve enough 
to print such an article, they have not 
nerve enough to endorse it, but get 
around the-fact in language intended 
to conceal their unbelief.” The state­
ment to which Professor Hower had 
reference is as follows:
A New York engineer and in­
ventor believes he has discovered 
the secret of overcoming gravity 
on which the world has worked 
for centuries. Physicists in Wash­
ington, reviewing his claims, so 
far withhold credit, but they 
frankly add that they did not be­
lieve in Roentgen rays when first 
accounts were given of them. 
Government experts are now ex­
amining Farrow’s apparatus. This 
magazine does not endorse his 
claims, but prints them and a 
story of his work because both 
are receiving serious attention.— 
The Editors.
¦ U ¦ 1 <Professor Hower went on to say, 
“What I object most strongly to is 
the statement made in the last sen­
tence that while the magazine does 
not endorse the inventor’s claims, it 
prints them. Upon what ground can 
they justify such actions? Also notice 
the statement that the government 
experts are examining the apparatus. 
They examine any new apparatus 
which is sent them with a request to 
patent. The whole thing is a mess 
of misstatements and statements so 
twisted as to convey a false impres­
sion to the large mass of lay and semi- 
lay readers who, not having had the 
training, can not recognize the fraud. 
Such pseudo-scientific articles written 
purely for sensationalism can not be 
too heartily condemned.”
Upon reading the article we agree 
entirely with Professor Hower. It is 
the first article in the magazine and 
covers parts of seven pages, being em­
bellished with five cuts. One of these 
is a picture of a California condor 
soaring. Another is a photograph of 
two pieces of paper dusted over with 
iron filings, a bar magnetic being 
placed under the one and a horseshoe 
magnetic under the other. The first 
part of the article is devoted to giv­
ing the life history of Mr. Farrow, 
the inventor. It tells that when Mr. 
Farrow was in the West he took much 
interest in watching the Indian medi­
cire mer go through their “divina­
tiors” ard ir watching the soaring 
birds from the desert. That such ap­
parent manifestations were possible at 
all was due, according to the reason­
ings of Mr. Farrow, to some unknown 
force which counteracted the force of 
gravity.
The “condenser” which Mr. Farrow 
claims he has invented and with which 
he is going to overcome gravity, is 
intended, according to the article, to 
increase the force of the Hertzian 
wave, this increased power being 
transmitted to the “verticle compen- 
ent,” whatever that may be. This 
“compenent” is what Mr. Farrow re­
lies upon to overcome the force of 
gravity for, in the words of the ar~ 
tide, it “thus intensified, offers a pro­
portionate resistance to gravitation 
and the force of the latter is reduced, 
thus giving buoyance to any object 
to which the condensing dynamo may 
be attached.”
“An aeroplane,” the article goes on 
to say, “equipped with one of these 
condensing dynamos of sufficient 
strength may be sustained in the air, 
or even shot up to greater heights, 
after its motive power has ceased to 
work. By turning on the current of 
electricity there is produced a hori­
zontal, circular, flat sheet, so to speak, 
of Hertzian waves which radiate out­
wardly for a mile or more on every 
side of the aerial craft. The effect of 
all this would be, in a measure, to 
suspend the craft by the edges of a 
thin magnetic plane of influence, a 
mile or more in horizontal circum­
ference.”
Mr. Farrow holds forth the propo­
sition that Dame Nature may have 
seen fit to “slowly evolve some kind 
of generators of Hertzian or wireless 
energy in hawks, buzzards and eagles. 
. . . ” He also points out that
“as the substancees, which are insu­
lators for common electricity, are 
good conductors for the so-called 
Hertzian waves, the feather points 
around the edges of the bird’s wings 
perhaps polarize a horizontal plane of 
influence, magnetic or Hertzian, in 
the atmosphere or suppositious ether 
surrounding the birds.”
The following paragraphs in quo­
tation marks are taken from the ar­
ticle to give an idea of the sort of 
rot that the author, one Robert H. 
Moulton, tried to pass off on. the un­
suspecting public.
“Though an aerial craft in the 
center of a wide, horizontal plane 
of magnetic stress might be im­
peded in perpendicular movement, 
yet it appears probably that as a 
horizontal movement would cut 
fewer lines of force, the ascent 
and descent in an inclined plane 
would be, perhaps, nearly as easy 
as a strictly horizontal motion of
the same craft. Devices can be 
employed for extending the mag­
netic or Hertzian stress in a hori­
zontal plane, of wdiich the aerial 
craft would be the center; also 
for generating the energy to pro­
duce such a plane of influence.
“Among the methods for pro­
ducing the horizontal magnetic 
plane around- the aerial craft, 
there can be employed a horizon­
tal row or ring of electric inter­
rupters or breaks for producing 
Hertzian waves, the ring of elec­
tric breaks extending in a hori­
zontal line around the sides of the 
aerial craft; or a similar line or 
ring of small electro-magnets laid 
horizontal with their ends point­
ing outward, these magnets being 
wound with many turns of very 
thin, well insulated wire and sup­
plied with high pressure electric 
current.”
“Magnetic or Hertzian wave 
impulses have a speed equal to 
that of light, or about 185,000 
miles per second. It makes no 
difference that this speed is made 
in vibrations, if they are so pro­
duced as to be in a horizontal 
plane; and it makes no difference 
whether this enormous vibratory 
speed be made in the atmosphere 
or in the supposedly all pervading 
ether. The effect will be the same. 
These horizontal vibrations being 
produced on the aerial craft, aHd
being in the same plane as the 
similar pulsations in the surround­
ing ether and the resistance of 
all vibrating matter to change in 
its direction of motion, will tend 
Strongly to diminish, if not abso­
lutely prevent, the down pull of 
gravity on the aerial craft.”
Among other things, the new inven­
tion could be used, the inventor 
claims, for the. fololwing purposes:
“If a 12-ton girder was to be 
raised to the top of skyscraper 
with a derrick of 10 tons capacity, 
the mechanism would obliterate 
the two tons of weight.”
“A steamship could be made to 
ride more lightly and easily on 
the sea by making it “lighter,” 
thus increasing its speed. If a 
steamer made twenty knots ordi­
narily, this speed might be in­
creased to twenty-hve knots by 
use of the condensing dynamo.”
The speed of railroad trains 
could be increased by the con­
trivance by reducing the friction 
of the wheels on the tracks. In 
the same way, automobiles, street 
cars, in fact any mechanically pro­
pelled conveyance, could be made 
to go faster with the same amount 
of power as at present used, or 
the same rate of speed could be
• maintained with a very small frac­
tion of the present effort em­
ployed.” *

(Continued from Page 1, Col. 3) is a greater evil than a benefit, many 
unique arguments being brought for­
ward.
A third meeting of great interest 
at which Dr. Savage was in attend­
ance was that of the Athletic Re­
search Society. This organization is 
comparatively young, but has already 
had a signal effect upon amateur ath­
letics. The object is to investigate 
the existing conditions in the amateur 
world and endeavor to encourage 
sports among school boys and mem­
bers of clubs that are not entirely ath­
letic in purpose. One of the principal 
aims is to establish conditions where­
by members of * collegiate, scholastic 
and organizational teams of good 
standing need not register in the A, 
A. U. to enter contests. This will 
eliminate an unnecessary registration 
fee the disposition of which is known 
to but a few of the controlling ele­
ment
Chancellor S. B. McCormick repre­
sented our neighbors, the University 
of Pittsburgh, at the meetings and 
was one of the principal speakers at 
the association meetings, his subject 
being “Athletics from a College Presi­
dent’s View.”
Dr. Savage has appointed Director 
Hamerschlag to assist him in drawing 
up a code of eligibility rules for the 
Second District.

It may be remembered that last 
Spring Professor McCullough ran 
some tests in the Materials Labora­
tory upon concrete floor slaps to de­
termine the efficiency of expanded 
metal in the flat arch or slap con­
struction. The results of these tests 
has recently been published in a little 
booklet by The Consolidated Expand­
ed Metal Companies, whose metal was 
used in the tests. This booklet is very 
interesting and contains some very 
valuable data. It can probably be ob­
tained by any persons so desiring by 
the writing to the company in the 
city and asking for it.
The tests were made on four arches 
and three sizes of the expanded metal. 
The slabs were loaded with pig iron 
and deflection readings taken at in­
crements of about every 150 pounds 
per square foot. At the time of test­
ing the age of the slabs varied from 
54 to 61 days. The Lehigh cement 
used passed the American Society for 
Testing Materials specifications and 
was mixed with screened anthracite 
cinders and local river sand. After 
making a series of volumetric tests, 
Professor McCullough decided to use 
a \ \2y2 Al/2 concrete instead of a 1:2:5, 
the proportions being based on dry 
sand and cinders. The cement was 
all mixed by machine and was of a 
wet consistency.
Upon a foundation of 1:2:4 gravel 
concrete, 12 inches thick and about 
three feet high were imbedded the 
bearing plates which supported the
I-beams of the slabs or arches. Each 
of these arches was of the flat type 
and was carried by two 12-inch 31y£
lb. I-beams spaced 6 feet on centers. 
These I-beams were connected by two 
¿4-inch steel rods with nuts so that 
there was little initial tension in the 
rods. The arches were 6 feet in 
length and the thickness at the cen­
ter and haunches was 4 inches and 15 
inches, respectively. The arches were 
all reinforced with sheets of expanded 
metal.
The pig iron used in loading the 
arches was piled in three separate 
tiers, each parallel to the I-beams. 
This was done to reduce the arching 
effect to a minimum. Seven holes 
were left in the concrete in which 
were imbedded slender wooden rods 
carrying scales at "the top, these rods 
being located at the center of the slab 
and at the center and ends of each of 
the I-beams that were carrying the 
slab. By means of a Y-level these 
scales were read to 1-64 of an inch, 
reference being made from time to 
time to a permanent bench mark in 
order to detect any change in the 
height of the instrument.
The detailed results can be found 
in the pamphlet together with numer­
ous photographs and a detail 'drawing 
of the structures. The arches were 
built in order to study their behavior 
under a total load of 54,000 lbs. or a 
unit load of 1,500 lbs. per sq. ft. and 
all of the arches were found to be in 
excellent condition under this load. 
The maximum load carried by the 
slab indicated that considerable arch 
action was developed and that the 
slabs should not be considered as 
fixed beams, for, assuming the slab 
to be a fixed beam, the maximum 
computed stress in the steel for a load 
of 1,500 lbs. per sq. ft. was about three 
times as great as the ultimate strength 
of the steel as determined in a tension 
test. It was also observed that 54- 
inch rods connecting the 12-inch I- 
beams which had little initial tension, 
were under a heavy tensile stress 
when the slab carried its full load. 
The tension cracks in the concrete 
at the haunches were very fine and 
did not increase in width as did the 
cracks at the center of the arch, thus 
indicating little tension in the arch 
above the haunches.

By recent action of the board of 
control of the Athletic Association, 
tennis was adopted as a minor sport 
and arrangements made whereby Var­
sity letters will be given to members 
of the team. In order that the school 
may be well represented in the spring, 
Manager Flood is working toward the 
formation of a tennis association. This 
will probably be the means by which 
inter-organization matches will be ar­
ranged, and material for . the ’Varsity 
four selected. Manager Flood will is­
sue a call in the near future to all 
men interested in tennis to gather to­
gether and formulate a plan for the 
spring tournaments.
The prospects for good matches are 
better in tennis than in any other 
sport this year. Cornell and Pennsyl­
vania have already written for con­
tests, and are under consideration.

Work on the new board track on 
Tech Field will be started this week. 
This definite announcement from the 
sources of power has caused great 
rejoicing among the adherents of ath­
letics in the three schools. It means 
that the track men will have a chance 
to train within easy reach of the 
schools and coaches, to say nothing 
of the advantages which the Field 
House offers.
The track will be one-tenth of a 
mile in length and will be banked at 
the corners to allow a fast pace for 
any race. Being out-of-doors, races 
in the early spring may be held with­
out depending upon the weather for a 
favorable track.
Training for the big indoor meets

By a recent action of the Faculty 
of the School of Applied Industries, 
a new course in Telephony and Sig­
nal Work is to be offered in the Elec­
trical Equipment and Construction 
Department.
The name by which this course 
shall be known has not been official­
ly adopted since the curriculum will 
include other systems of signally and 
transmission of intelligence, although 
telephone practice will be given the 
greater emphasis.
The course will consist of Lectures, 
Laboratory and Shop Work. The 
lectures will cover the history and 
development of the industry; theory, 
construction and operation of the ap­
paratus; circuits; overhead and un­
derground lines, etc. ,
Laboratory work to consist of reg­
ulation electrical and magnetic ex­
periments with special devices used in 
the various systems; drills in use of 
voltmeter, wheatstone bridge, and 
standard testing appliances as used 
in locating trouble in apparatus and 
lines.
In Shop Work there will be facili­
ties for actual practice in jointing 
and splicing; soldering and insulating; 
forming cables; splicing and branch­
ing cables including wiping joints in 
lead sheaths; adjusting and repairing 
bells, annunciators, ringers, relays, 
etc.; also installing complete systems 
of bells, annunciators, telegraph, tele­
phones, both exchange and private, 
or inter-communicating systems.
The only special class to be organ­
ized for this course will be a night 
class in Telephony, but a certain 
amount of work will be added to the 
regular day course in Electrical 
Equipment and Construction.
Mr. William C. Weaver, graduate 
of Pennsylvania State College, B. S., 
in Electrical Engineering, assumed 
his duties as assistant instructor in 
this department December 1st, 1911. 
Mr. Weaver has had several years of 
practical experience with the C. D. & 
P. T. Co., the local Bell interest, and 
was also engaged as instructor in that 
company’s plant school.

A meeting of the Junior Class was 
called to-order by President Richter, 
Wednesday, January 3, 1912, at 1 P. 
M.
Mr. Duff, Editor-in-Chief of The 
Thistle, spoke to the class concerning 
The Thistle. It was decided by the 
class that it shall cost $2 this year 
and everything looks favorable for 
the best of all year books. It is hoped 
that all students in all classes will 
contribute something, either in the 
line of cartoons, cuts or grinds.
Mr. Parry, chairman of the Prom, 
committee, reported that the commit­
tee was busy and arrangements are 
fast being made. It looks like a big 
night on February 16th.
The members of the class were also 
asked to consider the idea of adopting 
the Honor System. This is something
to which each member of the class 
should give a good deal of thought, 
and which should be considered from 
every point of view.---------o---------

In the recent Beaux Art Class B 
Judgment, two First Mentions were 
brought to the Schools through the 
drawings submitted by Chalfant and 
Nuzum. Only four completing the 
Plan Problem failed to receiv.e men­
tion. The result of the judgment of 
the Order Problems was hardly as 
favorable as was expected, only 
Humphrey and Klicker receiving 
mentions. However, there is always 
the inevitable next judgment to be 
looked forward to.---------o--------

On Tuesday, January second, short- 1 
ly after the chemistry lecture there 
was considerable noise in Room 218. j 
It was merely the Plebes acknowledg­
ing their thanks to Mr. Knapp, presi­
dent of the Senior Class. After a brief 
speech, but one decidedly to the point, 
Mr. Knapp announced that since the 
majority of the Plebes had shown the 
right spirit in regard to the wearing 
of the green caps, instead of wearing 
them until the end of the semester, 
as had been previously ordered, 
there would be no need of their doing 
so after January second.
At a meeting of December 14th, an 
election was held for Tartan Repre­
sentative of the Plebe Class. Each 
section put up a candidate, and W. W. 
Lauer, Section D, was elected.---------o---------

8THE TARTAN
[ “WTfi’. WTfi flD ToWt” (
Did you ever observe one of your 
beloved (sic) instructors before the 
elevator door, patiently, meditatively 
and then convulsively jiggling his 
key in the cell lock? It is, perhaps, 
just as well that you did not hear 
the incantation that he is murmuring 
to himself. It is no heathen rite that 
he is performing. He is working out 
a formula whereby lie can follow the 
lines of least resistance up three 
flights of stairs, while the janitors 
are joy-riding the elevator in fictitious 
pursuit of their calling, aided and 
abetted by broom and mop. But there 
are compensation. The varied pro­
gram of more or less refined vaude­
ville offered by our unterrified troop 
of trained janitorial specialists, wings 
the slow paced hours of each day. 
How often has the level monotony of 
class room stunts been rent asunder 
by passionate debate, in groggy Ger­
man, just outside the door, as to 
which of these artist shall exercise 
the elevator, while the others do del- 
sarte movements with the floor mop?
Just as instructor and students here 
reached the pleasurable conviction 
that personal violence is imminent, 
the discussion suddenly subsides to an 
innocuous international peace con­
gress murmur of decrepit lingo, and 
fades sadly away, as these wandering 
minstrel transfer their recital to an­
other door.
Those unhappily located at the east 
end of the building w’ho agonize in 
daily struggle with the impertinent 
and high-pitched conversation of 
Messrs. Booth & Flinn’s ubiquitous 
fussy little engines, miss much of 
these impromptu entertainments by 
our home talent.
One instructor claims to have in­
creased his chest expansion three 
inches and to have suffered a double 
hernia of his vest in these strenuous 
duets with the spluttering steam busy- 
bodies outside; while his students have 
acquired such uncanny facility in lip- 
reading, that they understand almost 
fifty per cent, of what he is trying 
to say, and at least ninety-five per 
cent, of what he thinks and is too 
much trammeled by civilized conven­
tion to express.
There is a fascinating mystery about 
these high priests of soap suds and 
scrub bucket. At 12 o’clock they dis­
appear as suddenly as if they had 
evaporated; so suddenly, indeed, that 
there is a temporary vacuum where 
they recently stood. What becomes 
of them is known only to an all-wise 
providence. As suddenly they pres­
ently reappear and rush frantically 
for the elevators. From then until
5 o’clock they hang furtively and rav­
ening about the doors of occupied 
class rooms and offices waiting for a 
moment’s relaxation of vigilance on 
the part of the beseiged to burst in, 
armed with their proper weapons, and 
begin to play checkers with the furni­
ture and to shampoo the floor.
Many is the time that instructor 
and students here wended their way 
to their appointed place of afternoon 
inquisition, to find the chair congest­
ed in a notcns heap in the center of
the room, and the remaining space 
1 full of waving arms and legs. Inci­
dentally, our pair of vibrant antennal 
is enthusiastically removing from the 
I blackboard every trace of a carefully 
constructed figure (labelled appeal­
ingly, “do not erase,” also “nieht ab- 
wischen”) or elaborate outline of 
predigested wisdom, wrought there 
previously for the intellectual regen­
eration of the incipient engineers.
And yet we love the untutored bar­
barians. They inject a sort of serum 
of variety into the educational cur­
rents of our being that makes us 
mimuna from ennui. Students and 
faculty have to step high to keep them 
off their corns. But withal, incandes­
cent smiles in foreign tongues; ready, 
if not exactly mercury footed, obedi­
ence, and plodding industry, envelope 
their frailties like a mantle of charity.
Honor* the mop brigade,
Honor the wild charge they made, 
Noble six hunkies!

Note—The Bureau has at the pres­
ent time an insufficient number of ap­
plications from men possessing the 
practical experience and technical 
training necessary for the more re­
sponsible positions which have come 
to its notice. It is hoped that a greater 
number of experienced men interest­
ed in securing employment, will com­
municate with this office.
