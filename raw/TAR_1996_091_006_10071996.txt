Symposium honors professor
Program devoted to discussion of computers
By TREVOR MEYERO WITZ
CaoMae UMavvsonMto
Between October 10 and 12, CMU will host the 
“Simon Symposium” in McConomy Auditorium in 
the University Center, to honor Nobel prize-win- 
.ning professor Herbert A. Simon.
The purpose of this symposium is to honor 
^Herbert A. Simon, whose many contributions to 
¡the University and to the scientific community 
have had a profound impact,” said Raj Reddy, 
Herbert A. Simon University professor and dean 
jofSCS.
Simon turned 80 earlier this year. “My col­
leagues thought that a symposium would be a nice 
¡way to celebrate, and since my life in a variety of 
ways seems to be tied up in computers, they 
'thought they would organize it around the vari­
ous areas of computer science and, in particular, 
items in intelligence that I’ve been involved in, 
and that’s sort of how the subjects got chosen,” 
said Simon, Richard King Mellon University pro­
fessor of computer science and psychology.
Each presentation consists of panels made up of 
local and external experts. The guests’ areas of 
I expertise include psychology, computer science, 
.engineering, art, and philosophy. Some of the 
speakers include Murray Campbell, a CMU alum­
nus who helped create the IBM chess 
¡supercomputer Deep Blue, Dr. Harold Cohen, an

“Carnegie Mellon University will lead 
educational institutions by building on 
its traditions of innovation and tran­
scending disciplinary boundaries to meet 
the changing needs of society.” This is 
the vision statement that is serving as 
the backbone for the current presiden­
tial search at CMU. Since President 
Mehrabian’s retirement last March, the 
University has been actively preparing 
for the task of finding somedne to fill his 
position. With the release of the udnMt 
Nawto this month, CMU’s official docu­
ment outlining its policies and purposes 
for potential candidates, the search has 
officially begun.
“We’re very busy,” said Pat Larkey, Chair 
of the Faculty Search Committee. “We’ve 
advertised in several places [such as] The 
New York Times.... [The advertisements] 
aren’t the primary source of candidates, 
though. There’s a list of prospects from 
data sources, and a list of nominations 
from an unbelievable amount of people. 
We’re busily in the process of searching 
this list [of approximately 530 people].”
According to Larkey, prospects are 
being considered not only from academic 
areas, but also the areas of industry,
government and foundations.
“It’s unlikely that CMU will have some­
one that doesn’t have intellectual stature. 
We probably need someone who under­
stands what is essential about Carnegie 
Mellon, but basically its fairly open and 
we’re in the process of evaluation,” he said.
“We have quite a few nominations and 
we’re in the process of sifting through 
them now. [We’re] pretty much where we 
expected to be [in the process]. It will take 
us a month to six weeks to get through all 
of those [nominations],” said Thomas 
McConomy, chair of the Board of Trust­
ees. “There are by far more academics [in 
the prospect pool], but there are a few 
from government, and industry too. We 
have also automatically nominated all 
deans and the provost and anyone who is 
nominated from the faculty in general.” 
The process of selecting a president 
involves many steps. First nominations 
and information about prospects are com­
piled by the Faculty Search committee. 
For this difficult task, CMU has brought 
in an outside firm.
“We’re being assisted by an executive 
search firm, Heidrick&Struggles, oneofthe 
biggest executive searchfirmsintheworld,” 
said Larkey. “All of the nominations flow

Construction continues on Intelligent Workplace
By SHEILA M. FLANAGAN
CaoMae pcenSo UMavvsonMto
The Intelligent Workplace 
has been under construction 
on the top of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie Hall since 
1992, and is expected to be 
completed this spring. The fa­
cility is a 700 square meter, 
43.2 meter long energy-effi­
cient laboratory of office inno­
vations which will contain ap- 
proximately 50 computer 
workstations. In addition to 
the computer workstations, the 
office will contain an area for 
collaborative work and a mul­
timedia area for video telecon­
ferencing in which classes may 
be held around the world si­
multaneously. The area will 
be available mainly to the fac­
ulty, staff, and students of the 
Department of architecture for 
hands-on research, as well as 
visiting scientists and other 
students on campus.
According to Stephen Lee, 
project manager of the Intelli­
gent Workplace, there are four 
main objectives that the de­
signers of this project had in 
mind when they began the plans 
for the Workplace. First, they 
wished to improve the health 
and motivation of workers in 
order to increase productivity. 
One example of a design that is 
more pleasing to a worker is 
personal climate control. Some 
other related features of the 
Workplace include switches at 
each desk that control a sound 
generator in order to maximize 
privacy and the amount of light 
that comes into the work area. 
The blue glass panels outside of 
the windows also add to the of­
fice environment. These panels 
maximize the daylight by re­
flecting blue light into the of­
fice. The natural light bright­
ens the work environment so 
that workers are less likely to 
be depressed and unfocused.
The second objective that the 
creators of the Workplace have 
in mind is the need to accommo­
date organizational flexibility. 
There is a need for large spaces 
in offices because they are con­
ducive to group work. There­
fore,
eluded plans for a teaming area 
in the Workplace in which people 
will be able to perform collabo­
rative work. Lee believes this 
area is one of the most signifi­
cant areas in the workplace. 
“There’s a real need for creativ­
ity in the workplace which I 
think is important and that is 
often lost,” he said. Having a 
collaborative area will provide 
a place where “people can come 
out of their cubbyholes and work 
together.”
• Accommodation of technologi­
cal adaptability is the third ob­
jective that the creators of the 
Intelligent Workplace hope to 
meet. According to Lee, access 
to the computer system is a vi­
tal part of this adaptability. “We 
have a completely open system 
with open floor tiles so that if 
someone needs to access the 
computer system, they are able 
to,” he said.
Computer wires are generally 
behind the wall, which makes 
them difficult to access. This 
open system makes repair of 
computer wires easier to com-

Democrats’ lawsuit says 
voters are suppressed
TRENTON, N.J., Oct. 1 (AP) — The 
Democratic State Committee on Tues­
day filed a lawsuit claiming New Jer­
sey guidelines will discourage thou­
sands of people from voting—particu­
larly in poorer urban areas that tend 
to lean Democratic.
• The suit renews charges of voter 
suppression that dogged Republican 
officials in 1981 and 1993.
“This issue is about voter protec­
tion,” said Cardell Cooper, chairman 
of President Clinton’s re-election 
campaign in New Jersey. “New Jer­
sey has unfortunately a long history 
of problems that relate to people 
having the right to vote.”

8 The suit, filed in federal court in 
Newark, says New Jersey guidelines 
issued to county clerks by Attorney 
General Peter Vemiero’s office violate 
federal law, and would make it diffi­
cult for low-income residents and mi­
norities to vote on Election Day.
~ Under the guidelines, people whose 
residency is questioned by poll work­
ers on Election Day will be required 
to go to the municipal clerk’s office to 
file an affidavit proving their new 
address before they can vote. The 
rule also applies to residents who 
have moved within their home county, 
but into a new election district.
The lawsuit, 
filed against 
Verniero, Secre­
tary of State 
Lonna Hooks, 
and the state’s 
county clerks, 
says imposing 
these security 
measures vio­
lates the Na­
tional Voter Reg­
istration Act.
Cooper said fed­
eral law requires 
that voters sim­
ply affirm either
orally or in writing at the polling place 
that they have the right to vote. A 
learing is scheduled for Wednesday 
jefore U.S. District Judge Maryanne 
Trump Barry.
_ “The purpose of the federal law is to 
-encourage people to go out and vote,” 
said Kathy Ellis, spokeswoman for the 
Democratic State Committee. “The
state guidelines usurp that. It would 
effectively discourage people from vot­
ing, because a process that should 
take you 20 minutes or a half hour can 
literally take hours.”
E.J. Miranda, spokesman for the 
attorney general’s office, said the 
state disagrees with the Democrats’ 
contention, and that it would op­
pose the request for a temporary 
restraining order. The state rule was 
adopted in 1995.
The suit says more than 15,000 
voters in Passaic County, 20,000 in 
Hudson County, and thousands more 
across the state have been “tagged” 
as having questionable residencies 
after sample ballots 
sent to their homes 
were returned.
“It affects the African- 
American, Latino com­
munity, and poor 
people, and we believe 
that the federal law was 
enacted to protect that 
class of people across 
the country,” Cooper said.
Angelo Genova, attorney for the com­
mittee, said using the mail to confirm 
voter addresses discriminates against 
minorities.
“The reliability of the postal service 
in many urban areas, we think, is 
suspect,” Genova said. “We believe 
there are bulk mail drops in highly 
populated areas, tenements, and the 
like, that may never see their way to 
the voters.”
Voter suppression charges are not 
new in New Jersey.
State and national Democrats won a 
federal court order barring Republi­
cans from activities 
the Democrats 
charged intimidated 
blacks from voting in 
the 1981 election. Re­
publicans employed a 
“ballot security task 
force” that utilized 
workers, including 
off-duty police offic­
ers, who wore arm 
bands and patrolled 
polling places.
In 1993, the Demo­
crats charged Repub­
licans with proposing 
a “ballot security” pro­
gram that would also frighten blacks 
from voting. Following that election, 
political consultant Ed Rollins bragged 
that the campaign for Republican 
Christie Whitman had paid black min­
isters and Democratic workers to sup­
press urban voting. The claim raised a 
furor, but state and federal probes could 
not find evidence of such an operation.
U.S. prepares to 
withdraw soldiers
BERLIN, Oct. 5 (AP) — The first of a 
new force of 5,000 GIs will leave Ger­
many in a few days for Bosnia to provide 
protection for the 15,000 U.S. soldiers 
getting ready to withdraw from the 
Balkans, the U.S. Army said Saturday.
The execute order to begin deploy­
ment was received from the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff late Friday, and troops should 
begin moving out by the middle of next 
week, said Lt. Col. Rod Davis, a spokes­
man at the Army’s European headquar­
ters in Heidelberg.
“Anytime you deploy you’ve got to 
make preparations and get your logis­
tics and transportation ready,” he said.
The 15,000 GIs are part of a NATO-led 
mission sent last December under the 
Dayton peace accord to separate Bosnia’s 
former warring factions. The peacekeep­
ing force’s mandate ends Dec. 20, and 
the 5,000-strong “covering force” is be­
ing sent to make sure the U.S. soldiers 
return from Bosnia unharmed.
Not everyone is expected to be back 
home by Christmas, however.
The Pentagon has said the withdrawal 
of the main force may run into early 
February, and U.S. troops could be there 
even longer if NATO decides to send a 
follow-up force.
Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade of the 1st 
Infantry Division, stationed in 
Schweinfurt, will be the first to leave 
Germany for Bosnia, probably on 
Wednesday, Davis said.
Other units being sent for the new 
force are the 11th Aviation Regiment 
from Illesheim, two Mechanized Infan­
try Battalions from Schweinfurt and 
support units of engineers, civil affairs, 
artillery, and psychological operations.
Equipment will be sent by rail and 
personnel by road, an Army statement 
said, with the deployment expected to 
take about six weeks in all.
The new force will have about 30 
Abrairis tfanks, 100 Bradley Fighting 
Vehicles, and 40 helicopters.
The soldiers have have been training 
since the summer to provide cover for 
the withdrawing GIs.
Unpaid teachers 
strike in Russia
BARNAUL, Russia Oct. 4 (AP) — In 
the latest sign of labor unrest in Russia,
12,000 teachers went on strike Friday in 
the Altai region to demand payment of 
back wages, union leaders said.
The teachers have not been paid since 
as far back as April or May, and are owed 
83 billion rubles ($15.4 million), union 
leader Leonid Ivanovsky told the ITAR- 
Tass news agency.
They picketed the regional adminis­
tration and parliament buildings in 
Barnaul, capital of the region in south­
ern Siberia, the report said.
The teachers were backed by doctors,
who staged a two-hour strike, ITAR- 
Tass said.
Teachers, miners, and other workers 
throughout Russia have staged frequent 
strikes or other protests over the issue of 
unpaid wages.
President Boris Yeltsin promised dur­
ing his spring re-election campaign to 
make sure all back wages were paid up, 
but the problem persists.
Europe approves 
new AIDS drugs
BRUSSELS, Belgium, Oct. 4(AP) — 
The European Union on Friday ap­
proved the use of two powerful new 
drugs that are designed to prolong the 
lives of AIDS sufferers.
The ruling allows sales across the 15- 
nation EU of the two drugs — Crixivan, 
made by Merck & Co. of the United 
States, and Invirase, produced by Swiss 
pharmaceutical company Roche Hold­
ing Ltd.
“These medicines offer new chances 
against AIDS,” said EU spokesman 
Jochen Kubosch.
Crixivan and Invirase belong to a new 
class of AIDS drugs called protease in­
hibitors that target the protease enzyme 
needed in the reproduction of HTV, the 
virus causing AIDS. By hindering the 
virus’s reproduction, the drugs can 
sharply reduce the amount of virus cir­
culating in the blood.
Both drugs have already been ap­
proved for sale in the United States by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Pitt researchers 
identify mutation
PITTSBURGH, Oct. 2 (AP) — Re­
searchers have identified the genetic 
mutation that causes pancreatitis, a dis­
ease that causes intense pain and makes 
eating difficult.
Teams from the University of Pitts­
burgh and five other universities col­
lected hundreds of blood samples from 
five families that have histories of 
pancreatitis.
They found that a gene mutation 
causes a reaction that slowly eats away 
the pancreas, which secretes an enzyme 
that assists the body in digestion.
The Slone family of Elkhom City, Ken­
tucky, assisted researchers by learning 
on their own that 80 people in their 
family tree of 400 had the disease.
Kevin Slone, 20, has had pancreatitis 
attacks since he was 11 and sometimes 
stops eating for days because digestion 
is so painful. After some attacks, he 
must be fed intravenously.
“I’ve seen my son literally crawling 
the walls with pain,” said his father, 
Bobby Slone.
The discovery of the mutation means 
doctors can identify people who might 
pass the mutation on to their children.
The findings could assist doctors in 
treating the disease. One possibility is
shutting down the pancreas’s enzyme 
secretions to reduce pain, but the patient 
would have to get the enzyme from an 
outside source, said Garth Ehrlich, direc­
tor of Pitt’s Center for Genomic Studies.
Findings were reported Tuesday in 
the journal yaMcot EtetMnbi8
Voter registration 
deadline nears
OKLAHOMA CITY, Oct. 3 (AP) - 
Voters have one more week to register 
for the general election, Election Board 
Secretary Lance Ward said.
Applications must be postmarked by 
October 11. The deadline applies to the 
Presidential election and other offices 
on the Nov. 5 ballot.
Ward said Thursday he worries many 
will register too late.
“For the first time in Oklahoma his­
tory, we have someone other than trained 
election officials handling voter regis­
tration applications for a Presidential 
election,” Ward said.
“We have candidates, supporters, and 
regular citizens going door-to-door or at 
fairs, in shopping centers, churches, 
bars, or wherever handing out and col­
lecting applications to register to vote.”
During the month before the 1992 
Presidential elections, 240,000 
Oklahomans registered to vote, 
Ward said.
In Virginia, voters may have to wait 
in longer lines than usual when they go 
to the polls November 5 because of new 
procedures set by the federal motor- 
voter law, election officials said.
The law requires new voters who reg­
istered by mail to present identification 
when they vote. Those voters who don’t 
have an ID with their printed name and 
a signature will be asked to fill out a 
form.
More jobs may go 
at Westinghouse
PITTSBURGH, Oct. 2 (AP) - 
Westinghouse Electric Corp. says it may 
cut more jobs at its main Pittsburgh 
headquarters and also at its energy sys­
tems headquarters in suburban 
Monroeville, Pennsylvania.
Westinghouse spokesman Kevin 
Ramundo said Tuesday that a company 
review could lead to layoffs in its depart­
ments for financial information, com­
munications, legal issues, and environ­
mental affairs.
The 1,000 employees affected by the 
review were notified Tuesday, Ramundo 
said. He emphasized that the review is 
not a result of the mid-September buy­
out offer Westinghouse made to its em­
ployees, but blamed it partly on slow 
sales in the company's defense electron­
ics and office furniture businesses.
Any job cuts will be completed by the 
end of the year, Ramundo said. 
Westinghouse has shed 24,000 jobs 
since 1993.

50 YEARS AGO, Nov. 12,1946: 
In response to the traditional stu­
dent chant of “We want Al!,” A1 
Minetti, Carnegie Tech alumni 
and a famed cheerleader, died of a 
heart attack two hours after lead­
ing the cheers on Forbes Field for 
Tartan fans. At half time, Minetti 
complained of dizziness and was 
rushed to Magee Hospital, where 
he succumbed soon afterwards.
Minetti had established him­
self as a major cheerleader, even 
before his graduation in 1925. A 
maj or in civil engineering, Minetti 
had been employed by the U.S. 
Government as an engineer. As a 
student, Minetti was a member 
of Sigma Epsilon Phi and Theta 
Tau, a section leader, a member 
of the Science Stag Stunt com­
mittee, and head cheerleader.
25 YEARS AGO, Oct. 21,1971: 
The Syria Mosque banned any 
further CMU-sponsored major 
rock concerts, a reprecussion from 
the Allman Brothers’ concert the 
previous week. The concert was 
stormed by approximately 400 
gate crashers. When the crowd 
was informed that no more seats 
were available, a few left, but the
rest tried to enter illegally by 
breaking windows or charging 
doors. Some ticket holders opened 
doors from the inside and one 
door was broken off its hinges.
The Activities Board had hired 
six off-duty police for crowd con­
trol, but eventually 48 Pittsburgh 
officers were called to the scene.
As the concert began, the police 
surrounded the theatre, covering 
all exits. Gate crashers persis­
tently circled the building, look­
ing for a weak spot in the police 
line. Half an hour later, police 
cleared the streets by threatening 
with dogs and billy clubs.
TEN YEARS AGO, Oct. 21, 
1986: The second annual anti­
apartheid rally was held on the 
Fine Arts Lawn. Approximately 
75 students endured cloudy skies 
to attend. The demonstration fea­
tured two speakers and several 
musical presentations addressing 
South Africa’s apartheid system.
Several students circulated a 
petition to free political prison­
ers, eradicate the segregated 
black townships, and lift the state 
of emergency imposed by the 
Pretoria government.
Students played hacky-sack, 
read pamphlets distributed by 
Students Against Apartheid, and 
discussed CMU’s holdings in 
South African corporations be­
tween songs. Music was pre­
sented by local and student bands 
Project 5, the Zone Bops, Second­
ary Modern, and Dial-a-tribe.
FIVE YEARS AGO, Oct. 7, 
1991: Student Senate’s Funding 
and Recognition Committe was 
redefined and granted new au­
thority. Previously, an organiza­
tion would ask for funding or rec­
ognition and Senate would vote 
on the issue, even if F&R rejected 
their proposal. This policy was 
changed by requiring that “any 
business brought before F&R 
shall require majority vote to be 
brought before Senate as a mo­
tion under special business.”
Two methods were kept for or­
ganizations to still reach Senate 
if rejected by F&R. They could 
ask a senator to bring the issue 
up in a motion at a Senate meet­
ing or they could get a petition.
Senate also defined probation, 
specifically for the Association for 
Life, a recognized organization.
AFL posted (on Andrew bboards) 
methods to reduce Planned 
Parenthood’s effectiveness and 
also hung offensive posters, which 
included Nazi symbolism.
ONE YEAR AGO, Oct. 9,1995: 
Sigma Phi Epsilon, CMU’s new­
est fraternity, initiated its first 
brothers after one week of re­
cruiting. After two meetings, 
which collectively drew 89 men, 
students were invited to sched­
ule an interview with Sig Ep rep­
resentatives. From those inter-; 
views, 40 men received bids.
Several of the meeting’s atten­
dants received phone solicita-1 
tions, after being recommended: 
by sorority members to Sig Ep' 
representatives.
Sig Ep had been a chapter at, 
Carnegie Tech from 1925 to 1937. > 
In more recent years, it has be­
come one of the largest fraterni; 
ties in the country, with 270 chap-; 
ters boasting 15,000 undergradu­
ates. After receiving approval; 
from the Interfraternity Council,; 
they recolonized at CMU.

Final month before 
election raises toss-ups
OKLAHOMA CITY, Oct. 5, (AP)
— Oklahoma polls last month 
found President Clinton edging 
ahead of Bob Dole for the first 
time this election year, but lead­
ers of both state parties warn the 
final weeks may alter the race.
A September 14 Kielhorn poll 
indicated the President leads Dole 
44 percent to 40 percent, with six 
percent supporting Reform Party 
Candidate Ross Perot. The mar­
gin of error for the poll was plus or 
minus five percent.
Clinton held a slight lead over 
former President Bush in early 
September 1992 in Oklahoma, but 
Bush won the state’s eight elec­
toral votes with 43 percent of the 
vote to Clinton’s 34 percent.
According to a 50-state Associ­
ated Press survey, Clinton entered 
Sunday’s debate clearly ahead in
25 states and the District of Co­
lumbia with a combined 314 elec­
toral votes — 44 more than the 
270 needed to win the White 
House.
Oklahoma and 12 other states 
with a combined 113 votes were 
considered toss-ups heading into 
the final month.
“I think the last few weeks are 
going to really be the difference in 
President Clinton winning Okla­
homa as the first Democrat since 
LB J in ’64,” said Democratic Party 
Director Pat Hall.
Hall said the improving state and 
national economy have helped push
Clinton ahead, along with thdS5 
President’s commitment to public-*- 
education.
He said the economy “and th£ 
fact that we’re better off today 
than we were four years ago” are 
driving the race in Oklahoma.
“In Oklahoma, people feel they’re 
safer with him and that he truly hasi 
accomplished more in the last two. 
years than they think Bob Dole could, 
accomplish given four years,” he> 
said.
Republican Party Director Miker 
Osburn said polling is too volatile 
at this point to predict the na-r 
tional outcome. o
“I think it will be closer than 
people think,” Osburn said.^ 
“That’s good news for everybody.:. 
What it shows is that people are:, 
starting to figure out Bill Clinton? 
does not stand for what they stand:- 
for.” F
The issue driving the race in. 
Oklahoma, he said, is character.
“I think it means a lot to people 
in Oklahoma that you have a 
President who stands for some­
thing and believes in something 
and sticks by that,” he said.
Both Hall and Osburn said 
Perot, who grabbed more than 20^ 
percent of the vote in Oklahoma” 
in 1992, will not beapresence. Both 
predicted Perot’s vote percentage! 
would be in single digits. UL
“He just didn’t live up to the} 
expectations in the Reform Party? 
in Oklahoma,” Hall said.
Workplace serves as office of future
WORKPLACE, from page 1
plete which also contributes to 
a higher rate of worker satisfac­
tion.
The fourth and most visible 
goal of the Intelligent Workplace 
is the improvement of energy 
effectiveness. The architects 
who have created this Work­
place seek to decrease the envi­
ronmental burden that most of­
fices create.
The effort to be environmen­
tally friendly is apparent in the 
materials that compose the 
Workplace as well as the heat­
ing, cooling and lighting sys­
tems and their controls. The two 
principal materials which com­
pose the Workplace are alumi­
num and steel, both of which 
are recyclable. In addition, ev­
erything in the Workplace is 
bolted so that someday every­
thing could be unscrewed and 
rebuilt somewhere else.
The heating system utilizes 
the heat from the hot water 
on campus, which is more en­
ergy-efficient. The cooling 
system simply takes in the 
natural outside air, dries out 
the moisture and cools it by 
using a fan.
The Workplace employs natu­
ral outside light as much as pos­
sible. Louvers on the outside 
windows contain sensors which 
allow the louvers to adjust them­
selves based on the amount of 
sunlight available.
In addition, the fluorescent 
lights inside contain sensors 
which detect the amount of natu­
ral light available and adjust the 
artificial light accordingly. These
adjustments have the potential 
to cut electric costs dramatically.
The Intelligent Workplace 
project is a collaborative effort 
among several faculty members 
of the Department of Architec­
ture at CMU as well as archi­
tects Pierre Zoelly, adjunct pro­
fessor at CMU, and Jon C. Jack- 
son. At the head of this effort is 
Dr. Volker Hartkopf, professor 
of architecture and director of 
the Center for Building Perfor­
mance and Diagnostics at CMU, 
who established the Advanced 
Building Systems Integration 
Consortium'(ABSIC). ABSIC is 
an industry-university-govern- 
ment partnership dedicated to 
improving the quality of the 
workplace. Also involved are 
Vivian Loftness, head of the De­
partment of Architecture at 
CMU as well as faculty mem­
bers Dr. Ardeshir Mahdavi and 
Lee. A team of architecture 
graduate students as well as 
students from the Department 
of Computer Science and De­
partment of Software Engineer­
ing are also involved in the 
project.
At this time, .laboratories 
similar to the Intelligent 
Workplace exist at only two 
other universities. Rensalaur 
Polytechnical Institute in New 
York has a lighting lab, and
Berkeley has a laboratory 
which is modeled on the Intel­
ligent Workplace here at 
CMU.
Noot Bharani, a junior archi­
tecture major, said, “Our class 
took a tour of the Intelligent 
Workplace last semester, and I 
think it’s really great to have all 
of this ‘up and coming’ technol­
ogy right over our heads.... There 
are so many toys, bells, and 
whistles, if you will, that are 
exciting to see actually being 
used as environment controlling 
factors.”
Not only does a place such as 
the Intelligent Workplace hold 
enormous potential in the col­
lege setting, but in the real 
world as well. According to Lee, 
building an office space mod­
eled on the Workplace would 
cause a 20-50 percent increase 
in first cost. Nevertheless, the 
architects involved with this 
project at CMU plan to work 
with the Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration to 
create an economic model in 
order to observe the compo­
nents of the Intelligent Office 
Space and compare their costs 
to existing features of offices. 
This model would provide an 
accurate visual representation 
of the benefits of such a work­
place.

j Crime and Incident Report
1(V2 SUSPICIOUS PERSON,4:51am. 
A Central Property Service employee re­
ported that a male suspect was tampering 
with the parking meters on Tech street. 
The actor was going from meter to meter, 
looking at them from his vehicle. The actor
¦ finally parked the vehicle at a meter and 
¡left the area on foot.
The employee felt that the actor was
¦ damaging the meters. An officer ran a 
I check on the license plate of the vehicle, 
which revealed it belonged to a CMU 
student. The officer went to the student’s 
¡room and spoke with him. The student 
claimed to be using a paper clip to remove 
something that had been become stuck in
;! the meter. Upon returning to the scene, 
*the officer found the paper clip and re-
> moved it. A check revealed no other dam- 
’ age to the meters.
10/2 ARREST WARRANT, 2:29 pm. 
IA campus officer met with a city detec- 
¡tive and U.S. Marshall, who were on 1 campus to serve an arrest warrant for 
! an employee of Highlander Cafe. The
¦ warrant was served at 11:50 am at the
Highlander basement kitchen. The sus­
pect was arrested peacefully and taken 
away. The campus officer indicated that 
the suspect’s apartment revealed food 
service items that may belong to CMU.
1<V3 SUSPICIOUS PERSON, 2:03 pm. 
A student contacted campus police and 
reported that there was a male masturbat­
ing in the Doherty Hall shower room. Two 
officers and a security guard reported to 
the hall. A single male was in the stall. 
Upon leaving thestall, he was stopped and 
identified as a CMU student.
Upon being told why he was stopped, 
the actor denied that he was masturbat­
ing. The actor stated that he feels un­
comfortable because the showers are so 
public, and that he sometimes showers 
with his shorts on.
The student who reported the incident 
stated entering the bathroom and seeing 
the male there with his clothes on the 
hook, and said thathe never heard water 
running. The actor said he had taken a 
shower. A check of the stall found that it
was wet, as was the actor’s towel.
10/3 THEFT, 7:22 pm. A Carnegie 
Mellon student filed a bike theft report 
with an officer. After parking the bike at 
the University Center Forbes Avenue 
bike rack at midnight, the victim no­
ticed the bike missing an hour later. The 
bike is valued at $500.

Point Park, Duquesne 
Universities may merge
PITTSBURGH, Oct. 5 (AP)—Point 
Park College could get a cash infusion 
by aligning itself with a larger neigh­
bor, Duquesne University.
Gerald McGinnis, chairman of 
Point Park’s board of trustees, told a 
meeting of about 100 students, fac­
ulty, and staff Thursday that the 
schools had been talking since April.
An alliance could bring in $10 mil­
lion for financially strapped Point 
Park. Both schools are in downtown 
Pittsburgh.
Many in the audience were sur­
prised and angry, and demanded 
more information.
McGinnis provided few details, 
but said Point Park would remain a 
separate private liberal arts col­
lege and would continue to focus on 
career education. But some pro­
grams could eventually merge, he 
said, and Duquesne’s investment
would give the university control.
“If they pay the bills, you could 
expect we would be reporting to 
them,” he said.
Point Park needs $10 million to 
computerize the campus, renovate 
the school’s Playhouse, repair build­
ings, and increase faculty salaries, 
McGinnis said.
The larger Catholic university has 
not yet committed to the affiliation, 
Duquesne President John Murray 
said.
“Mergers, affiliations, and various 
kinds of agreements are taking place 
throughout the U.S. among many 
colleges and universities,” Murray 
said. “I think it was certainly a mat­
ter of time before it happened in this 
region.”
Point Park must decide by Novem­
ber 1 whether to finish negotiations, 
McGinnis said.

“We’re anxious to get early feed­

The program originally began 
as student project work within 
the masters program in infor­

from the National Science

a tremendous impact on how stu­

At this point in time the alpha 
version is at the stage of proto­
type testing. According to Tygar, 
this is the first of three tests. The 
beta version will replace funny 
money with real money.
“We expect that the technology 
will be picked up by an outside 
organization who will run a pro­
duction version of this system,” 
said Tygar. “Currently, in our 
alpha test, it’s restricted to CMU 
students and staff. In our later 
tests, we’re going to include other 
universities, and eventually, ev­
eryone.”

Symposium honors Nobel laureate

expert in computers and the 
arts, Reddy, as well as Simon 
himself.
“The people who are coming 
or the people who are h,ére are 
all first rate folks that I've 
known in the past. I expect to 
hear exciting new things from 
them, and I’ll be disappointed 
if I don’t,” said Simon.
Simon, who in 1978 received 
the Nobel prize in Economics, 
has been teaching at CMU 
since 1949. He has made ma­
jor contributions to the Psy­
chology, Business, and Com­
puter Science deptartments.
“Really, every college bears 
some mark of his intellectual 
contributions.... He has been 
at the nucleus of many of the 
initiatives that the University 
has undertaken over the past 
five decades,” said Paul 
Christiano, University pro­
vost.
Simon is one of the founding 
fathers of artificial intelli­
gence and cognitive psychol­
ogy. He has received numer­
ous awards, including the Na­
tional Medal of Science, the 
American Psychological Asso­
ciation Award for Outstand-

ing Lifetime Contributions to 
Psychology, and honorary doc­
torates from 29 colleges.
Simon received his bachelor’s 
degree and his doctorate in po­
litical science at the University 
of Chicago. Before coming to 
CMU, he taught at the Univer­
sity of California at Berkeley and 
at the Illinois Institute of Tech­
nology.
Simon has also written sev­
eral books on artificial intelli­
gence, management theory, and
his autobiography, entitled 
zSlt6i Sv z7 Gnvt8
The symposium provides an 
opportunity for all to see the 
cutting edge of the fields of Dr. 
Simon’s research and is open 
to students, faculty, and staff.
“The occasion for this sym­
posium is the kind of affair 
that the University should 
have a lot of.... When we talk 
about quality of student life, I 
guess that’s part of what I think 
of,” said Simon.
Presidential search takes off
SEARCH, from page 1
but [the firm] is useful because they 
have contacts throughout the world.”
The next step involves the Fac­
ulty Search Committee with the 
help of the Board of Trustees re­
ducing the list of nominees to 
about three dozen, according to 
McConomy. At this point, the 
trustees become more involved 
and decide who to interview.
“Probably by the tail-end of 
November or beginning of De­
cember [candidates will, come to 
campus],” said McConomy. 
‘They’ll be kicking the tires — 
seeing what [CMU] is like. Some 
have visited before, but it’s been 
a number of years. They’ll want 
to see the buildings, the campus.”
“[When] the trustees become 
involved, we decide who to inter­
view,” said Larkey. ‘Then the 
trustees make a recommendation 
to the Chair of the Board.” Ac­
cording to him, this recommen­
dation could be anywhere from 
one person to around three people. 
“[The trustees] provide an order. 
They may say any three, or they 
may express a slight preference. 
TomMcConomy, Chairman ofthe 
Board of Trustees, then decides 
who he’ll offer the job to first, 
perhaps with the help of some of 
the trustees,” Larkey said.
“As the number of prospects is 
narrowed down, I will play more of a
role,” said McConomy. “But my role 
so far has been to see that the pro­
cess is laid down and putinto effect.”
According to Larkey, once an 
offer is made to a candidate, it 
will not become official until the 
Board of Trustees votes on it.
“We’re optimistic,” said 
McConomy. “All of us have to 
take this seriously — we’re se­
lecting the leader of the Univer­
sity. We’re going to do it right.”
To try and make sure that the 
entire campus community is in­
volved in the search for CMUs 
next president, there have been 
numerous committees formed 
such as the Student Liaison com­
mittee in which six students are 
serving as a liaison between the 
Faculty Search committee and 
the entire student body.
“More than anything, we’re us­
ing this as a way to be able to take 
student perspective ... because 
once the whole process starts, we 
can’t talk [about it anymore], be­
cause of confidentiality,” said 
Katie Hart, Student Body Vice 
President and member of the Stu­
dent Liaison committee.
Despite advertising and re­
freshments atthemeetings, there 
was poor attendance. “[The meet­
ings] haven’t been very success­
ful yet. I think students think 
that [the presidential search] is 
far-removed from them, which is
unfortunate,” said Hart.
Jay Shankavaram, anothejr 
member of the Student Liaisctfi 
Committee added, ‘This [commit­
tee] is a very important platforcfi 
that students have. During thp 
final stages, the six of us will 
have an opportunity to meet thp 
candidates. [This search] is try­
ing to forge an identity for CMT-J 
for the next century.”
“Take an interest,” said 
McConomy of the poor attendanc 3 
at the Student Liaison meeting^. 
“This is your institution as much as 
anyone else’s. It doesn’t start to be­
come your institution after yo^ 
graduate—it becomes your institu­
tion as soon as you matriculate.” He 
added though, that the search is in 
its early stages and he believes that 
interest will build as time goes onl| 
The announcement of the neit 
president is expected to come be­
fore commencement. McCononiy 
said, however, that “We’re not gcj- 
ing to speed this up to meet some 
artificial deadline. Dr. Mehrabiai 
has been extremely cooperative in 
agreeingto stay through commence­
ment. We plan to make the decision 
well before that, but if we don’t, He 
has agreed to stay. His cooperation 
is critical for us to do this right.” - j 
‘You go to a great school, and this 
will be carried off in the same way ak 
anythingelse is carried off at CMU-4- 
in a great manner,” McConomy said.Student Senate Minutes

Homecoming picnic 
must offer interaction
^'Homecoming Weekend is in 
"Siree short weeks, and it seems 
though, once again, students 
„will have a tough time finding a 
(good opportunity for interacting 
%ith Alumni.
While administration, faculty,
> ^taff, and students interact daily 
i f-gn a variety of levels, alumni typi- 
: ij^lly have considerably less con­
tact with the University, and par- 
TtScularly with the current stu­
dents. Homecoming provides the 
¦perfect opportunity for such in­
teraction.
ncrUnfortunately, it has tradition- 
! &!ly proved to be ineffective in 
i providing venues for such inter- 
i a'ction, and at this point, it ap- 
! ¿¿ears that this year will be noi
-¡different.
nn This interaction is important in 
several ways, to both alumni and 
i students. For both parties, it pro- 
i vides a way to observe how the 
; University has progressed and de- 
! veloped. Legends, both new and 
• old, could be shared, and the “Uni- 
i versity Community,” which pur-i
(Bortedly includes students and 
.alumni, can better appreciate 
^iheir Carnegie Mellon experience, 
s jjothretrospectivelyforahimsand 
I; 'fh the present for students. This 
¿{vould benefit the University di- 
; nrectly in that current and future
! 'Alumni will be more willing (and 
I perhaps even more able) to give 
i more substantial gifts to CMU in 
t the future.
There are specific benefits for 
E gtudents and alumni as well. 
5 sWhen brought in contact with 
[ alumni, students stand the chance 
\ of making professional contacts 
! that can prove invaluable after 
| «graduation. In general, the wealth 
t of knowledge that CMU alumni 
| possess collectively is too valu- 
i ,gible and rich to be withheld from 
t current students.
There are true advantages to 
interactions with students for the 
Alumni as well. For exemple, an 
alumnus who donated funds to 
their department can find out 
what the students think of the 
new laboratory the donation sup­
plied. Or, on the simplest level, 
an Alum can just chat with some­
one with whom they have some­
thing important in common.
A fairly obvious opportunity for 
such interaction is the annual pic­
nic held on the Saturday of Home­
coming. Once almost-mockingly 
referred to as the Student Alumni 
Picnic, the barbecue could offer 
the perfect opportunity for the 
kind of interaction that is so nec­
essary.
This year’s, as in the past, seems 
to be a potentially disappointing 
situation. The picnic, to be ca­
tered by an outside organization, 
will cost both alumni and stu­
dents $10 a head. There is noth­
ing short of preposterous about 
this.
Not only does this economically 
disclude many students from the 
event, but it is an insult to attend­
ing alumni, whom we should be 
welcoming with open arms.
The bottom line is this. The or­
ganizers of the Student Alumni 
Picnic still have time to make 
good on this year’s event. If the 
picnic is too large a financial bur­
den so that it is completely neces­
sary to charge for it, at least offer 
it at a reasonable price, i.e., some­
thing far less than $10.
The Homecoming Committee is 
trying to make it possible for stu­
dents and alumni to react, or so 
they claim. However, a $10 cover 
charge for a barbecue is not a step 
in the right direction. But again, 
there is still time, and hopefully, 
the organizers won’t blow it for a 
third consecutive year.
Paranoia strikes deep in Baker Hall
Doug Howe
I have a class in Baker Hall on the 
second floor. It’s a small room and there’s 
not enough space even to turn around, 
but we have a good ol’ time anyway. We 
have a good time, that is, 
until around 1:05 pm ev­
ery Tuesday and Thurs­
day, when the old, mam­
moth TV set hanging by 
a thread above the chalk­
board takes a pictures of 
us. At least that’s what 
we all think. Sure, no­
body has actually said 
anything about it, but 
that’s because the room 
might be bugged and who 
knows what could hap­
pen? We ain’t taking our 
chances. Land of the free, 
home of the brave, my 
ass. If I’m so bloody free, 
why does the TV twitch a 
white flashing light at 
the same time every day, 
especially when the TVs 
off. Huh?
Is Big Brother out 
there right now?
Watching?
Waiting?
Can he see me? Can he 
hear me? Did he know what I had for 
dinner? Can he do my income taxes for 
me? Does he have a girlfriend? Does he 
get fringe benefits? Is there a fan club? 
Can I be a Big Brother?
All these questions and more will be 
answered on the next ­nbdaol ht7 UdSs. 
But coming up next, “Is Your Overweight 
Mother Sleeping With Your Gay Lover’s
Priest?” And if so, should we give her a 
free makeover?
I’m feeling a bit funky today. I think 
it’s the drugs. I gotta get off the smack. 
It’s killin’my acid buzz. No, actually, I’m 
wigged because the first thing I heard 
this morning from my roommate’s ste­
reo was a Parliament song, and the first 
lyrics I heard were, “I got jam in my legs, 
and I’m ready to spread.” With that 
roaming around in my head all day, how
coordinating outfits.
But with my luck, I’d do that, and 
they’d all be color blind. Fate just works 
that way.
But what I really have an inkling to 
talk about is, I guess, “Part Two of the 
Series: CMU — What the hell are we 
doing to ourselves?” This section is about 
technology. I’m a bit hesitant to start 
composing anything about the subject, 
figuring either someone out there will 
get pissed and screw up my 
credit for the rest of eter­
nity, or that, if we’ve 
reached that level yet, that 
the computer itself will re­
volt against me and erase 
my documents and never 
allow me to use my toaster 
again. But I’m willing to 
bite the bullet, for you, the 
otalto8
A few weeks ago, a gentle­
man came into my Voice 
Over Acting Class (prepar­
ing the young and the rest­
less to do spots for radio 
and TV), and he was from 
somewhere on the other 
side of campus.
He was a grad student 
doing his master’s thesis 
on recording emotion vo­
cally in order to allow com­
puter to eventually respond 
to “living beings” (read cats, 
dogs, human life-forms) in 
a more humanistic way. He 
Sb6fWn7•Tartan Business Manager would record us each, us-
can I help it being a bit funky?
For a while I was even toying around 
with the idea of writing an entire article 
about how cool it would be to name all of 
your children after colors in a Crayola 
Crayon Box. Bittersweet. Goldenrod. 
Sweet Magenta. Green.
If nothing else, there’d be family unity. 
And you wouldn’t have trouble color
ing similar texts but in different pat­
terns of emotion such as happy, sad, 
angry, etc.
Then he would go and do something I 
am unqualified to even attempt to ex­
plain. I guess I’ll just pretend that magic 
elves did it in the middle of the night 
while the shoemaker was asleep.

Homecoming Dance 
tradition must not die
Welfare reform aims in wrong direction
! SDC took close to a $4,000 loss on 
i last year’s Clippership homecoming
* dance. The SDC programmingpeople 
| ¡¡jave decided not to run the risk of 
i taking another loss; therefore, until 
; last Friday, there have been no in- 
{ tentions of holding a Clippership 
i ^omecoming dance.
{ vfi After some CMU “grass roots” ef- 
£ »forts to persuade SDC planners to 
j ‘¿hange their mind, a ship for the 
I; praise has been secured, and it looks 
!; ijjke there is a chance of the tradition 
i i&>ntinuing — fortunately. Because 
I iglthough last year saw a poor tum- 
iout, this year, SDC should definitely 
“lie able to make a dcgt success of the 
Clippership Homecoming Dance.
The main reason for last year’s 
failure was due to poor publicity for 
Jhe event. Students can’t go to an 
event that they don’t know about, 
perhaps SDC’s leaders should be 
commended for being more careful 
:with their budget, but now is no time 
|o act scared. Now, more than ever, 
j is the time for a gala homecoming
S Celebration.
! ^ With turnout to the football games 
! improving, as is the overall student 
! enthusiasm at CMU, this is the year
> for SDC to capitalize on the excite- 
; (jiient. The Homecoming dance can 
' finally be reestablished as the big- 
x gest party of the fall season — and 
t now, since the ship can be reserved,1
 there is still time to plan and pro­
mote a dance.
( Formals are sparse at CMU. The 
¦reek community and a few inde- 
indent organizations such as SpiritI!
offer a number of them throughout 
the year. However, Homecoming is 
a chance for any students to partici­
pate in such an event. Perhaps the 
event should even be elevated from a 
semi-formal to formal status to 
heighten the pomp and excitement 
surrounding the event. The Home­
coming dance on the Clippership 
ought to be CMU’s biggest social 
event of the year.
SDC needs to take advantage of a 
freshmen class that packed the 
Clippership during Orientation, with 
many students not even getting the 
chance to buy tickets. With the proper 
publicity, the Homecoming dance will 
be a success.
For one thing, SDC can use the 
audiences at Saturday night movies 
to publicize upcoming events. With 
hundreds of students attending the 
movies each week, SDC representa­
tives can make brief announcements 
before the screenings begin so that 
students are sure to know of the 
event. Even though most students 
will not be carrying enough cash to 
purchase tickets, at least they will 
be made aware of events.
With posters around campus and 
word of mouth, turnout is sure to be 
a success. SDC has good to reason to 
be nervous about a failed event be­
cause of CMU’s history, but the cam­
pus has a new feeling about it this 
year, one that needs to be milked 
instead of shied away from.
If ever there was a year to take a 
risk on the Clippership, this is the 
one to do it.

superceded by the right to a “good” job, to total health care, to 
higher education, etc. It has become so absurd that a friend of 
mine recently suggested he might as well start pursuing 
Huxley’s vision of the right to sex on demand.
The absurdities and destructive nature of our incessant 
clamoring for more rights is nowhere more apparent than in 
the debate over welfare reform, which culminated in the 
recent welfare “reform” bill.
It is easy for an upper-middle class white male to sit back 
and complain about the misuse of his tax dollars. It is true 
that, in the face of the waste and fraud in the defense budget 
and agricultural subsidies,

welfare is a small problem, 
fiscally. However, there is 
something far more insidi­
ous going on, and to deal 
with it without punishing 
children requires signifi­
cantly more extreme and 
improved measures.
If we want to truly reform 
welfare, we must admit to
and address some very fundamental and not-too-pretty as­
pects of human nature.
In a booklet on vegetarianism I co-authored, we use a quote 
by Thomas Edison: “Non-violence leads to the highest ethics, 
which is the goal of all evolution.” To be honest, however, non­
violence is only the goal of moral evolution; biological evolu­
tion has the simple goal of propagating genes to the next 
generation. This can, and does, lead to situations where 
children are brought into the world under warped and violent 
conditions. As long as we clamor only to “put welfare mothers
decreases the chances of the mother ever leaving the circle of 
poverty and hardship, but condemns lt vabMS the child to the 
same life. The fact remains that in most cases, a child born 
into the welfare system will not leave and will face a life of 
inner-city destitution and abuse, surrounded by crime and 
drugs. A system that perpetuates this cycle and damns 
children to this life could — indeed should — be seen as 
immoral. Fixing the system requires an understanding ( 
what is at stake: the lives of innocent children.
A person applying for welfare is saying that they cannot 
care for themselves and thus need other people to pay their 
bills. Obviously, if a person cannot care for themselves, they 
cannot care for another person, especially a child. As ; 
society, we do not allow someone on welfare to adopt an 
already existing child. Instead of being a right, receiving 
money from others must be viewed as a contract; in order not 
to perpetuate this cycle of poverty, one of the stipulations of 
this contract would have to be not to have children while 
dependent upon others’ money. This can be done by supplying 
welfare applicants (men and women) with Norplant or the
_____________________________ equivalent as the condition of
the welfare contract. While 
today’s welfare reform tends to 
punish children bom to wel­
fare mothers, requiring the use 
of contraception minimizes this 
situation.
This would not be fascism, 
for it would not infringe on any 
rights—the person is under no 
obligation to enter into the con­
tract. However, it is not a right to take money from others;; if 
someone taking public assistance wanted to have childrep, 
they would be able to once they found a job and were able 
support themselves. This would also not be, as some haye 
termed it, genocide, but the opposite- instead it would help to 
break the cycle of poverty that creates the violence that kills 
so many today.
Instead of being “barbaric,” this system would be humane 
in that it would free children from lives in the ghetto, and 
would allow more children to be valued and cared for as the
to work,” or “protect the children,” without taking steps to important responsibility and unique and worthwhile ind,i- 
prevent these doomed children in the first place, the cycle of viduals they are. 
violence will continue despite (or because of) our moralizing
and mourning. ha66 ni a Nd» iMclteM8 $t st6bSfti ae7 otiwSeinO6t otw6nVi

Unexpected Democratic support angers officers
James Stepanek
A little while ago much hoopla was in the 
news about Clinton getting the endorse­
ment of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) 
national organization. This was trumpeted 
as an indication of how he’s strong on 
crime and has stolen another issue from 
the GOP. Well, as usual, the truth has 
little to do with this surface impression.
The first bit of information which belies 
the importance of this endorsement is that 
t it barely scraped by the committee. The 
national FOP usually doesn’t endorse 
anyone in Presidential elections, but in 
this case about 40% of the board decided to 
endorse Clinton, while the rest were di­
vided between Dole and no endorsement. 
Normally an organization won’t endorse 
someone unless a majority agrees, but I 
guess this just couldn’t be called normal.
. Furthermore, the national FOP is more 
like a big labor union than, a large body 
which reflects the views of the average 
policeman. I recently received a call solic­
iting support from the local FOP, to whom 
, I usually contribute. I expressed my dis­
may with the national FOP endorsement 
:/ of Clinton and was pleased to hear that the 
= man at the other end of the line was even
more angered by it than I. Thus it appears 
that the view of the national FOP doesn’t 
even reflect that of the locals. Heck, the 
FOP of New York recently endorsed Dole.
In any case, the national FOP used the 
excuse of Clinton’s strong crime fighting 
successes in office as the reason for the 
endorsement (not the fact that he sucks up 
to big labor). They claimed that passing 
the Brady Law, the Assault Weapons Ban, 
and putting 10OK new police on the street 
show his commitment to law and order. 
It’s funny that they picked these things as 
examples (though there was nothing else) 
since all of them have been useless, or at 
the least a pale shadow of the effectiveness 
that would be expected.
The Brady Law, which provides for a 
waiting period and background checks for 
handgun purchases, is one of the things 
which Clinton loves to trumpet as a suc­
cess. It’s not a success, merely an admin­
istrative nightmare for local police depart­
ments. Clinton often claims that huge 
numbers (60-100K) of felons were pre­
vented from buying guns.
This is unadulterated BS. The total num­
ber he shoots off is for people denied at 
first attempt. The majority 'of these are 
passed on further examination of the case. 
Only 44% of denials were over felonies 
(many of these denials were due to confu­
sion of identity though), and of that in a 
state by state analysis, the percentage or 
these felonies which were violent peaked
at 15%. Now, of course, the reason for the 
law must be to enable the government to 
find and prosecute criminals when they 
try to buy guns. This is the only obvious 
reason, right? Considering that a felon 
trying to buy a gun is a federal offense, this 
should be a straightforward matter.
A reasonable measure of the success of 
the Brady Law should be how many people 
were convicted of trying to buy guns ille­
gally, right? Guess what the total was. A 
whopping Mdott wtSw6t were locked up. 
Ooh, that’s impressive isn’t it?
I guess all those other people who were 
actually of criminal intent utilized the 
more than ample supply of black market 
guns. In fact, a survey of police chiefs 
nationwide showedthat85% ofthem didn’t 
believe that Brady was a hindrance to 
criminal acquisition of firearms.
OK, on to the next “triumph,” the As­
sault Weapons Ban.
This was the colorful law in which nasty- 
looking guns were banned from regular 
arms p roduction.
Of course, varieties which were func­
tionally equivalent were allowed to be 
produced. This doesn’t work.
Aside from the fact that the guns in this 
category are not at all the favorites of 
criminals (these are all pretty large and 
bulky, while criminals consider stealth of 
primary importance), the fact was that 
these guns had never accounted for more 
than 1-2% of firearm crimes.
Then there’s the fact that there are no 
documented cases of police being killed 
by any of these weapons, so one wonders 
why the FOP would really care about 
them. It doesn’t quite make sense.
Now we get to the last claim of a crime- 
fighting coup by Clinton. There’s the sub­
ject of the 100K extra police on the streets. 
As usual, we face yet another untruth. 
The provision in the Crime Act of 1993 
which funded this actually only funded 
25% of the salary of any given new police­
man, and then only for the first five years.
The real truth of this claim is that only 
about 16K new policemen have been hired 
as a result of this. Hmm, I wonder why 
Clinton doesn’t use the real number? 
Maybe he should be a little more “conser­
vative” when reporting numbers.
Again, we see a big news story which 
comes out praising Clinton, yet does not 
even question any of the assumptions 
fundamental to the story.
The endorsement and its justifications 
were quite fishy and yet the press didn’t 
bother to question a word.
The headlines were just used to make 
Clinton look good, to hell with the facts. 
The truth is, Clinton has done basically 
nothing in a positive sense to combating 
crime, and this endorsement is just an­
other labor union lining up behind him.

Then, Shazaam!, computers 
talk. He wanted actors be­
cause, I guess, our trained, 
feeble brains emote better than 
normal, sane people.
Oh, yeah, and we’d get paid 
fifteen bucks an hour. That 
was the clincher.
M-O-N-E-Y! Give actors 
money, they’re poor, they’ll do 
anything to sell their soul for a 
paycheck. Granted, I’m being 
overdramatic (go figure).
I don’t think this guy from 
across the way was attempt­
ing to use this experiment/the­
sis statement for the forces of 
evil, but advancing technology 
such as that would only lead to 
mass destruction of some kind.
Dennis Miller once said 
about VirtualReality, “The day 
an overweight, wife-beating 
construction worker can come 
' home, sit down in his reclin­
ing, leather chair with a beer 
in one hand and a remote con­
trol in the other, and have 
cybersex with Claudia Schiffer 
is the day the world ends.”:
Well, Dennis, that day is 
right around the bend in the 
info-super-parkway.
When this guy came to talk 
to us, he informed us of the 
other technologies that are 
currently being experimented 
with and are in the beginning 
stages of production. .
The idea that stood out the 
most was the computer chip 
surgically implanted in your 
hand. It would allow individu­
als to transfer information 
from one person to another 
with the same chip capability,
without ever having to say it. The 
implanted chip would hold infor­
mation like your name, telephone 
number, address, and whatever 
else you wanted on there, I guess.
Shake a dude’s hand and know 
his life story. This isn’t from a 
Ray Bradbury novel: this is now.
If anyone has seen the British 
film, yartl2 by Mike Leigh, you 
know how pos sibly imp ending the 
doom is with this kind of “ad­
vancement.”
In the film, the main character 
is talking about the end of the 
world, the Big Bang II.
He refers often to the Bible’s 
account of the end, quotes such 
things as that the sign of the 
damned, 666, will be imprinted 
on the individual’s hand and fore­
head. He goes on to recount the 
newspaper-recorded fact that 
soldiers in the Gulf War were 
surgically implanted with bar 
codes in their forehead and/or 
hand, so that they didn’t have 
to carry any information around 
with them and that the govern­
ment could, by computer, know 
exactly where they were and 
what they were doing.
The main character goes on to 
say that, because of the math 
and computer language, a bar 
code is separated into three 
coded sections.
Each one represents a differ­
ent aspect of the theorem, for 
the computer to identify what it 
is. Now it gets scary.
Each section of the three, if 
left to infinity, in the computer’s 
language, equals six. 666.
Now, I don’t know anything 
about computers but I asked 
my friend in Connecticut if this
was true, and after I told him 
the circumstances, he con­
curred and said that, yes, nu­
merically, each section does 
equal six. Again, I’m not nec­
essarily exclusively aware of 
the Christian belief of the end 
of the world, but I do believe it.
It could be as accurate as 
any of the other future doom 
adventures people come up 
with. And if the 666-deal ¿s the 
oriethat’s going to come to pass, 
why take the chance of getting 
a computer chip in you, any­
way? It’s something that’s not 
done. Hell, I think it’s stupid 
even if it has nothing to do 
with the end of the world.
As my good friend, Nicole, 
once said to me, technology 
should be there to enable man 
to have more time.
It allows us to free ourselves 
from the small worries in our 
lives in order to think, experi­
ence, ponder, live, and advance 
Scoit6•ti8
Why bother advancing tech­
nology that only drives us fur­
ther and further away from 
human interaction?
That’s not what it’s about. 
It’s about people and life. Not 
programs and detachment. Be 
a friendly citizen, smash a com­
puter today. But not the one 
I’m on right now. It may be 
watching me.

Senior strives to de-stress
Tom Harper
Man, I need to de-stress. 
De-stressing should be widely 
practiced, especially around here. 
De-stressing should be a unique 
concept all to itself, not limited by 
what one can do to de-stress.
Usually, though, I’m either too 
tired or too broke to de-stress. 
And, even then, when all I can do 
is homework or sleep to try to 
vent my frustration, I either 
stress out reading because I might 
have missed some vital point for 
discussion in class the next day, 
or I have a bad dream and wake 
up in a cold sweat. Either way, 
I’m in trouble here.
Next month I’m going to have a 
few interviews. The last thing I 
need then are facial tics, blood­
shot eyes, wrinkled suits, an ex­
pression on my face that says “I 
just woke up two minutes ago,” 
constant yawning, or the urge to 
scream “Evil alien warrior-mages 
from Dakzar will take over your 
bodies! How do you like them 
apples, suit-boy?!”
I used to deal with stress by 
reading. The really good part 
about dealing with str e ss this way 
is that often I have no reading 
assignments due the next day, 
the next week, or the whole 
month, because I read so far. 
“Hmmm... I only have to read 
forty pages for Wednesday. Why 
don’t I read the sdS6t Mdneg while 
I’m at it?”
Next thing I know I finish the 
book, and it is 3:30 am.
At such late hours it’s also im­
possible to find good cuisine, and 
I’m usually hungry then because 
I’ve read for six hours straight or 
more. The only vittles I can find 
are in a vending machine under­
neath Cyert. One can also meet 
some very interesting people 
there — like me, of course.
I also used to deal with stress 
by going to the gym and riding 
the exercise bikes. I’d usually take 
something to read also. This is 
really cool because it’s free. Now 
though my problem is that after 
classes I usually don’t have the 
energy to go exercise.
I’d go back to my room to nap 
but then I’d sleep for seven hours 
or more and I wouldn’t want to go 
to sleep because I slept already.
I know we have a lot of stuff in 
our gyms, but one thing I haven’t 
seen is a heavy bag. If there is, let 
me know! Then I’ll bring my 
gloves down and go absolutely 
nuts on the thing.
A friend of mine back home had 
one and we had a blast with it. 
And if we don’t have one, why not 
get one?
It’ll probably be the most used 
item in there, mostly because I’ll 
have pictures.scannedin of people 
I hate and have them taped on 
the thing.
Well, I guess I should re-ar­
range my schedule to accommo­
date de-stressing, but 111 do that 
later, after I go to sleep ... again. 
The best things in life really are 
free.
Good night.

The women’s volleyball team passed the halfway 
flftint of the season this past weekend, carrying 
t^eir record to 7-16 overall. The team hosted its 
G^wn tournament on Saturday in the Wiegand Gym- 
•r\gsium, competing against teams from California 
IJriiversity of Pennsylvania, Case Western Re­
serve University, Roberts Wesleyan College, and 
Q^irlow College.
.At the tournament, the Tartans defeated Carlow 
Qollege, but lost the other three matches of the day, 
flushing in fourth place. Senior captain Sarah 
Pfacocha was pleased about beating Carlow, who 
t^iey lost to last year. In a heartbreaker of a loss,

Freshman Beth Sekowski touches the ball over an 
attempted block.
Roberts Wesleyan edged out CMU in five sets, 
winning the fifth game 15-13 in rally-scoring. A 
win in that match would have earned the team, 
third place. The tournament featured “some good 
defensive play by Sarah Putaro and Ashley Kinsey,” 
according to Pacocha.
Despite the outcome of the tournament, coach 
Julie Webb said, “We’ve improved tons, even since 
the first day.” Webb also said that other teams 
were continually complimenting the Tartans on 
their improved play over previous years. Webb 
said, “We’re young, we’re working more as a team. 
We’re shaping up.”
On September 27-29, the team traveled to the 
University of Chicago to participate in the UAA 
Round Robin Tournament—an important matchup 
as the team looks forward to the UAA Champion­
ships at Emory University at the end of the month. 
The team came in sixth, beating New York Univer­
sity 3-1 and sweeping Brandeis 3-0. Webb was 
proud of the team’s performance, saying that the 
team was competing well with the other teams. 
The only team that dominated the Tartans was 
Washington University, a traditional powerhouse.
Webb also said, “We’re a great defensive team.” 
The team is excellent at defensive play, but their 
height disadvantage gives them troubles putting 
away the ball for the point. Webb said, “We can’t go 
for the hard-driven kills, we have to come up with 
other ways to put the ball away.” Pacocha said, “We 
have to work at placing the ball — even though 
we’re short, we can work on putting the ball down 
in different places.”
Pacocha is optimistic about the team’s future. 
She said that this year, they have “a better coach, 
and, with her recruiting, better people.” She also 
said, “[Coach Webb] is giving us the right drills to 
improve ... it’s helping us a lot.” Webb said, “In the 
next couple of years, we’ll definitely be a competi­
tor within the conference.”
The volleyball team next hosts Chatham College 
on October 17 in Skibo Gymnasium, followed by a 
quad-meet on October 19 against Alfred Univer­
sity, Washington & Jefferson College, and Penn 
State-Behrend in Wiegand Gymnasium.
ëross country teams battle Grove City
By CHRIS CANNON
C3oMae YiiniMaeM ytsi ’lnMSo
-iThe men’s cross couhtry 
team raced over 5.1 miles of 
hills, trails, and cobblestone 
t6obeat Grove City on Satur­
day morning. CMU won by a 
score of 26-30, in a close com­
petition that saw the top two 
i»unners finish within one sec- 
cind of each other.
I “I could have had him if I 
rfeally had to,” said second 
¿lace finisher Kristo Kriech- 
t(aum of the first-place Grove 
(tity runner.
i. CMU used conservative tac­
tics to capture the win. “Our 
strategy was to sit on their sec­
ond guy,” explained Meckley. “I 
was just being a little cautious 
because we have two good races 
coming up.”
(“Had it been race conditions, 
hjad coach said stick with their 
tpp guy, me, Kenn, and Kriech 
cpuld have got him,” said Josh 
D,onner, who finished second 
for the team with a time of 
26:58.
;-The contest at the front was 
cjose throughout the race, with 
the Grove City runner only lead- 
ifigby 15 feet. “They would push 
ajhead on the uphills and we 
wfcould catch them on the down­
hills,” said Kriechbaum, who 
finished in 25:52.
^Freshman Kenn Oldham 
(¿5:59), junior Brian Ingram 
(^6:28), and senior Ron 
Pplcawich (26:32) rounded out 
the CMU scoring.
.¡Holding back seemed to work 
forr all the Tartan men. “The B 
tejam had a great race today, 
wiihich is great because this was 
pretty much our last one,” said 
sophomore Jeff Vitek
•On the women’s side, Carnegie 
Mellon finished second to Grove 
City, despite injured runners, 
“^e had two women out, our 
fifth [place runner] injured her 
ankle,” said women’s coach 
Dario Donatelli. The coach
men Amy Antoci (20:28), Eliza­
beth Currid (20:28), and Alison 
Covell (22:26).
However, the times may be 
misleading, because a change 
was made to lengthen the course 
and the Grove City leader some­
times strayed from the shortest 
route. “The leaders didn’t know 
where they were going and ev­
erybody else followed them,” 
Donatellio said.
Despite the difficulties, the 
runners were excited about the 
results. “We don’t have very
many home meets, for what our 
goals were today; which were to 
keep up with the Grove City 
girls and get a good race in, I 
think we did really well,” said 
McGrannaghan.
“We ran faster than expected, 
one girl PRed [set her personal 
record] today,” she said.
The Tartans will travel to 
Dickinson College on Saturday, 
October 12, before heading to 
the UAA Championships at 
Washington in St. Louis on 
Saturday, October 19.

The team has its momenta* 
though. Missed passes an<j 
loose plays have cost the tea*ffl 
this season, and although thejj 
have made up for these slip,

of offense and their tight de­

needs to be shored up. Granted^ 
missed plays are usually the 
result of an off day or a bail

But the Tartans are in a 5-1*j 1 position before this weekend's 
matches with eight more ganifei 
this season, and to continue 
winning, they can’t afford tHji 
slightest mistake. “We hav£ 
some things we want to accom­

track.”

Men defeat GC
By NATHAN STEINWALD
CaoMae pcenSo UMavvsonMto
After a week off, the men’s soc­
cer team returned to action on 
Tuesday with a 1-0 win against a 
highly ranked Grove City team. 
The tough win put the Tartans 
back in the wins column after 
their tough loss to UAA opponent 
University of Chicago.
The team’s one-goal win was a 
good start to what is one of the 
toughest parts of their schedule. 
Tuesday’s game was only the 
first in a stretch of four games 
that the team will play in only 
nine days. Three of the four 
games are on the road, with the 
last at home on Wednesday, 
October 9 against Waynesburg.
The Grove 
City game rep­
resented yet an­
other tough test 
for the young 
CMU team.
Grove City came 
into the game 
undefeated at 
7-0. The game 
went back-and- 
forth with nei­
ther team able 
to produce a 
goal. Finally 
CMU was able 
to break the 
deadlock. On a
well deserved penalty kick the 
team took a one goal advantage 
which proved good enough to 
carry them to victory.
The defense and goalie Ben 
Katzman were able to preserve 
the fragile one goal lead despite 
Grove City’s attempt to equal­
ize. As the team handed Grove 
City its first loss of the season, it 
was also able to improve its own 
record to a respectable 5-3.
The win represented an im­
portant step for the team. Being 
able to start their last road trip 
with a win helped to boost their 
confidence as they move into 
their games later this week. On 
Thursday the team left to play 
games against UAA teams 
Brandeis and Rochester.

Unusual situations create NFL trades
From the Goal Line
O7 ­Sear Unegda6
I How many of you realized that 
{he trading deadline in the NFL 
was this coming Tuesday? Not 
much fanfare, is there? Unlike its 
sibling sports leagues, the NFL 
does not often see a flurry of ac­
tivity around the trading dead­
line as potential playoff champi­
ons try to pick up the missing 
pieces and playoff pretenders pick 
up warm bodies for the future.
That’s why this past week has 
been so strange in the NFL. There 
aqtually was a trade involving 
real players, while it also appears 
that a first-rate quarterback may 
soon be switching time zones.
In the professional sports 
leagues in America, trades are a 
fact of life that teams use to build 
champions. Take baseball, for ex­
ample. When the Atlanta Braves 
were horrible in the late 1980s, 
tjjjey unloaded veteran pitcher 
Doyle Alexander to the Detroit 
tigers, who were in the middle of 
a tight pennant race. In return, 
the Braves got a minor league 
¿layer by the name of John 
§moltz. That trade certainly 
forked out for them. Now that 
tjhey are good, the Braves are on 
tjhe other side of the fence. This 
mil1 they picked up ace starting 
pitcher Denny Neagle from the 
Pirates around the trading dead­
line, allowing the Pirates to un­
load a salary while also picking 
up some prime prospects for the 
future.
; Such trades also occur in both 
Hockey and basketball. In hockey, 
tjie Pittsburgh Penguins pulled 
o;ff one of the monumental trades
in history when they were able to 
pick up the great Ron Francis 
and the ferocious Ulf Samuelsson; 
a trade that directly led to their 
two Stanley Cups. A similar trade 
by the NBA’s Houston Rockets 
got them Clyde Drexler and two 
NBA titles.
Why are there so few trades in 
football? One reason is that foot­
ball requires teamwork on a level 
unparalleled by any of the three 
other major sports. For a player 
to come in, learn a whole 
team’s playbook, and 
be effective is a very 
difficult task. Just 
look at what hap­
pens to rookies who 
hold out for an ex­
tended period of 
time (see how 
much time Jeff 
Hartings of the 
Lions, who just 
signed this past week, 
gets). Of course, a vet­
eran player needs less 
time than a rookie does 
to become acclimated 
to the system, but the 
timingrequired in 
football to make 
an offense or de­
fense successful is 
not something 
that can 
be picked 
up with­
out a lot of 
practice.
Another limiting fac­
tor is that the talent 
level across the league 
is pretty well spread out, and 
seldom does a team have a sur­
plus of players at one position 
that they are willing to give up. If 
they do have a surplus, they are 
much more likely to unload play­
ers on draft day, when they can 
get prospects who will be with 
them for many years and may 
also be considerably cheaper than 
obtaining a Pro Bowl veteran.
Draft day is the one time when 
there is a flurry of activity among 
teams in the league. Usually, 
teams are trying to get room un­
der the salary cap and finding 
ways to pick up a few new fresh 
faces, while contending teams
Simona Lo/Tartan Art Co-Editor
seek to pick up players that could 
lead them to the promised land.
Such was the case this year on 
draft day, when the Rams gave 
the Steelers Jerome Bettis for a 
mere pittance in draft picks.
But then, why did we actually 
see a trade this week between 
Miami and St. Louis, while also 
hearing rumors of a potential deal 
involvingthe much-maligned Jeff
George? One reason is that both 
of the situations for these deals 
involve unusual circumstances. 
In the case of the Dolphins, the 
team has lost its All-World quar­
terback, (that’s Dan Marino for 
those of you who have lived in a 
cave the past 13 years) and does 
not have a real tight end who can 
be used as a reliable option on 
passing plays. So, in order to get 
a real tight end, the Dolphins 
shipped their No. 1 pick from
1995 (some offensive 
lineman named Barry 
Milner) to St. Louis in 
exchange for Pro Bowl 
tight-end Troy 
Drayton.
The George case is 
much stranger. By 
now you all know 
that he got into a 
heated argument 
with his head coach, 
June Jones, on the Fal­
cons sideline in the 
middle of a game, which 
led to his suspension 
from the team and sub­
sequent attempts to 
trade him.
The Seattle Sea- 
hawks are interested 
in George because 
their QB of the fu­
ture, Rick Mirer, 
has been unable 
to produce the 
miracles expected 
of a former 
Golden Domer. 
Then again, what 
young quarter­
back has lived up to expectations 
over the last five years? Anyway, 
the other team that has shown 
interest publicly is the Oakland 
Raiders, who will do just about 
anything to stop their opponents 
from making moves that could 
potentially improve them. The 
Raiders have supposedly dangled 
their current QB, Jeff Hostetler, 
along with the young, budding
defensive superstar, Chester 
Mcglockton. But who knows 
what is actually going through 
the mind of A1 Davis? Remem­
ber, this is the guy who had 
Marcus Allen benched for sev­
eral years. In any case, there 
already has been a one-for-one 
trade in the NFL during the 
season, which is odd enough. 
And now it seems that a high- 
profile quarterback is about to 
get a new address.
Games of the Week: 
Miami at Buffalo: Can two 
teams that are over a thousand 
miles apart be real rivals? It 
appears so, as the Dolphins and 
Bills hook up again in what has 
become one of the fiercest divi­
sion battles in the NFL of late. A 
damper has been put on this 
one, though, since Dan Marino 
will be sitting it out. Then again, 
Jim Kelly has been injured, so 
his status is also up in the air for 
the game. But who doesn’t want 
to see a Craig Erickson-Todd 
Collins showdown?
Baltimore at Indianapolis: 
What would have happened if 
this game were in Baltimore? 
Would the fans cheer for their 
beloved Colts? The Ravens band 
is called the Colts Band. Too bad 
this one will be in the dome. 
Watch the Colts defense play 
catch with Vinny.
San Francisco at Green Bay: 
Playing on one’s home-field is 
known as having the homefield 
advantage. Some teams’ advan­
tage (Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Den­
ver) is a lot bigger than that of 
other teams (Tampa Bay, Hous­
ton, Atlanta). But the mother of 
all home-field advantages is the 
frozen tundra known as 
Lambeau Field. Watch the Pack­
ers defense tee off on whoever is 
the 49ers QB du jour.

Avalanche looks to defend Cup
From the Point
O7 paiSe Yeloabrn
Can the Avalanche defend the 
Stanley Cup and keep it in the 
Rocky Mountain state? The most 
important part of establishing a 
dynasty is keeping the nucleus of 
the team together. That’s the main 
reason teams repeat—if they fail 
to do this, they fall apart.
Look at the New Jersey Devils. 
In the 1993-1994 season, they 
made a surprising run for the Cup 
and lost in triple overtime, one 
goal away from their first Stanley 
Cup finals. They kept the core 
players together and won the Cup 
the following season. The next 
year, they lost Conn Smythe win­
ner Claude Lemieux, role-player 
Jim Dowd, and the prototype de­
fensive defenseman Bruce Driver. 
What happened next? The Devils 
didn’t even make the playoffs.
So far, the Avalanche have 
taken the first steps towards keep- 
ingthe core of their team together. 
In the off-season, they re-signed
rugged winger Mike Keane and 
defenseman Alexei Gusarov, and 
they made sure that Claude 
Lemieux will retire as a member 
of the Avalainche. However, they 
lost Stephane Fiset, Warren 
Rychel and Dave Hannan. 
Hannan, whohadbeenac- 
quired at the trading dead­
line, contributed during 
the playoffs by winning im­
portant face-offs against 
another tough center, 
Florida’s Brian Skrud- 
land. The loss of goalie 
Fiset could be a major fac­
tor if veteran Patrick Roy 
goes down with an injury.
With Fiset they had a ca­
pable starter sitting the 
bench, but now all they 
have are unproven rook­
ies backing up Roy. Keep­
ing Roy healthy will be a 
major factor in the Ava­
lanche having a success­
ful season.
It would also be in the 
Avalanche’s best interest 
to re-sign Valeri Kamen­
sky and Chris Simon. 
Kamensky and Simon were their 
top left wings last year, and if 
they are not re-signed, that leaves 
sophomore Rene Corbet as the 
only man on the left side from 
last season.
Speaking of Corbet, the Ava- Sweden to the semifinals, 
lanche has a core of youngsters showing all the way that he,
that can contribute to a long 
dynasty. Corbet and Stephane 
Yelle provide youth up front, and 
this may be the season former
Anna Gilbert/Tartan Junior Staff
not Eric Lindros, is the super- 
star of the future. Claude 
Lemieux and Adam Foote 
played solid for runner-up 
Canada, with Foote 
scoring what was going 
to be the Uwe Krupp- 
like series winner if not 
for Team USA’s come­
back. Joe Sakic’s play 
for Canada was a bit 
lackluster and hopefully 
not a vision of things to 
come for Colorado. Much 
like his role with the 
Avalanche, Adam Dead- 
marsh was a workhorse 
third-line center for the 
World Cup Champs, 
Team USA.
With a few smart moves, 
the Avalanche will be the 
best-prepared team in the 
past four years to repeat 
Stanley Cup wins, some­
thing that hasn’t -hap­
pened since the Penguins 
did it in the 1990-1991 
and 1991-1992 seasons.
first-rounder Wade Belak takes 
his place at the blue line.
Thanks to the World Cup, we 
got a preview of what the Ava­
lanche will be like in thel996- 
1997 season. Peter Forsbergled

Columnist predicts Braves repeat
The Hot Corner
O7 zaMM 5cbbaoS
The time has come for baseball writers 
across the country to make their post-season 
predictions and show how little they know 
about the sport with which they consume 
themselves. I realize that this column will 
not be read until the first round of the 
playoffs has been completed, so please for­
give me if all of my picks turn out wrong (the 
majbrity of these picks were made before 
postseason play began last Tuesday).
American League First Round
New York Yankees versus 
Texas Rangers 
These evenly matched teams should pro­
vide the most exciting series of the first 
round. New York has better pitchers, Texas 
- much better hitters, and this series will 
not be decided until the very end. In 1995, 
the AL West Champs (the Mariners) elimi-
nated the Yankees in the first round; the 
same thing will happen in 1996.1 pick the 
Rangers to win in five games.
Baltimore Orioles versus 
Cleveland Indians 
Baseball provides at least one 
major upset each year, and my 
1996 surprise pick is the Balti­
more Orioles (in no 
way is this related to 
Cleveland sweeping 
my Red Sox last 
year). The O’s fi­
nally-gelled as a 
team down the stretch 
and aré on a roll heading 
into the playoffs. The Indi­
ans, meanwhile, do not have 
the chemistry (or the pitching) 
that carried them to the World 
Series last year. Both teams, 
though, have potent lineups 
that set the stage for several 
high-scoring games. Sorry,
Tribe fans: Orioles will win i| 
in four games (hey, it could 
happen).
American League 
Championship Series
Orioles versus Rangers 
The Orioles will 
be flying high fol-
lowing their triumph over the Indians, but it 
won’t last. The Rangers lineup can out'slug- 
anyone, and not all of their pitchers are 
totally useless, they have at least two quality 
starters. Regardless, Texas will shock ev­
eryone by beating Baltimore in six games 
and making it to the World Series in their 
first-ever post-season appear-
National League 
First Round
Atlanta Braves versus 
Los Angeles Dodgers
Let’s see: the Braves hit better 
than the Dodgers. The Braves 
play better defense than the 
Dodgers. The Braves have loads 
of post-season experience while 
the Dodgers have very little. 
The Braves finished Septem­
ber on a roll; the Dodgers ended 
the season by being swept by 
the Padres. Oh, yeah, the 
Braves can pitch, too. Braves 
in three games.
San Diego Padres versus 
St. Louis Cardinals 
This series matches two rela­
tively equal teams against 
each other. The Tony

Volume 91, Issue 6The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania7 October 1996
By DAWN PAPUGA
CaoMae YiiniMaeM UwSoMi ’lnMSo
The Tartans matched up against 
Dickinson and effectively destroyed the 
Red Devils’ 3-0 record. Dickinson was 
ranked 15th in the nation in Division 
III, and CMU dominated the Devils the 
entire game beating them 21—7.
The Tartans got off to a slow begin­
ning this season by losing their first two 
games against Franklin & Marshall 
College and Case Western Reserve Uni­
versity, largely in part due to injuries 
and poor playing on both sides of the 
ball. The team went through some tough 
practices and tough coaching, and picked 
up some real momentum coming off of 
the Grove City win.
Since then, the Tartans have won two 
more games, allowing only seven points 
in the past two wins. This says a lot for 
the team defensively, and shows that 
they are starting to play effectively again. 
“The defense was very focused,” said 
coach Rich Lackner. “They really helped 
to control the offensive line, and read the 
option well.”
The Tartans’ defensive strategy for
Dickinson was to eliminate the option, 
including the pitch and the toss sweep. 
The Tartan defense performed extremely 
well — picking off three interceptions. 
“One great interception was made by 
senior Nate Morgan to prevent a 
Dickinson touchdown,” said Lackner. 
The other two were in the fourth quarter 
by juniors Josh Stauffer and Vince 
Sonson. These performances essentially 
sealed the victory for Carnegie Mellon.
The defensive line did exceptionally 
well, creating some major plays with an 
incredible number of tackles. Senior cap­
tain Ray Ardire had ten tackles, while 
defensive tackle Anima Nwankwo and 
senior linebackers Jarrod McAdoo and 
Jason Lehman had six tackles apiece. 
The defense has really stepped up to the 
level that they needed in the beginning 
of the season, and it is apparent in the 
way the team is playing.
The Tartan offense was what really 
stood out in the game against Dickinson. 
The Tartans aren’t a team that is well- 
known for their third down conversion 
numbers, but this past game, they con­
verted close to 50 percent of their third 
and fourth downs to first downs. The
offense controlled the ball for approxi­
mately 42 minutes of the game, which 
was a huge part of the win. The team had 
24 first downs to Dickinson’s 12.
The Tartans took control of the line 
of scrimmage and gave good protec­
tion to senior quarterback Dave 
Soltysik, who was coming off of an 
ankle injury that kept him out of the 
game against Rhodes last weekend. 
Soltysik was seven of 15, passing for 
98 yards and no interceptions. The 
Dickinson quarterback was five of 19 
with three interceptions and only 77 
yards.
Not only was the passing game ef­
fective, but the Tartan running game 
has really picked up. CMU had two 
rushers with over 100 yards. Fresh­
man fullback Mike Campie was handed 
the ball 37 times, and he stole 178 
yards from the Red Devils defense. 
Senior running back Buck Neel had a 
total of 108 yards rushing in only 16 
attempts.
This is an incredible improvement 
for the Tartans from the beginning of 
the season. For a more statistical look 
at the running game, the Tartans had

fullback Wesley Wright punches through a hole in the Rhodes defensive line in last week’s game.
a total of 326 yards rushing to 
Dickinson’s 207. Overall, the Tartans 
had an incredible net yardage of 424 
yards — 140 yards more than 
Dickinson’s 284.
All three of CMU’s touchdowns were 
through the running game. The first 
touchdown was by Neel in the first 
quarter on a five-yard run, which was 
set up by a fumble recovery by senior 
Ray Ardire. In the third, freshman 
running back Wesley Wright brought 
in the second touchdown. This touch­
down ended a 13-play drive for 73 
yards. The final Tartan touchdown was 
in the fourth quarter when Neel ended 
a seven-play, 73-yard touchdown drive.
The Tartan kicking game didn’t ap­
pear quite as strong as in the past few 
games. The team barely missed both 
Tartan File Photo field goal attempts, but made all three 
extra points. Overall, the Tartans
played better Saturday than they have 
all season, and it was a well-deserved 
win.
In their next game, CMU squares off 
against Washington University on Oc 
tober 19. At the beginning of the sea­
son, Washington was ranked first and 
CMU second — despite both teams 
sharing the UAA Championship Title. 
With Washington (3-1) returning 19 
of its starters, the CMU (3-2) coach­
ing staff sees this game as the most 
difficult of the season.
Calling it a “great challenge”, 
Lackner attributes the other team1 
ability to their combination of “overall

performance,” said co-head 
cobch Chris Maples about the 
Carnegie Mellon Crew team’s 
pelrformace this weekend. “We 
traditionally do well at the Head 
ofi the Ohio.” The team headed 
dqwntown to participate in the Head 
of the Ohio competition, and came 
away with a number of medals.
in the fall season, the club con­
centrates on distance races, called 
h^ad races, instead of the spring 
season’s sprint races. The Head

ent th at features a 5,000- meter 
course from the 31st Street Bridge 
,oiji the Allegheny down to the 
PjDint. The race is held more like 
ajtime-trial, as the boats do not 
start all lined up in a row. This
year, the event featured an exhi­
bition race between the US and 
Canadian Men’s National Teams.
“[The rowers] really decided 
this was the race that they were 
going to make their own,” said 
Maples. “It was really apparent 
that every time they put their 
boats in the water they were go­
ing to make their own.” In the 
Rec" Singles event, Jurg Schluep 
won a silver medal. In the Alden 
Singles, Catherine Molloseau 
won the gold. In the open Men’s 
Double, the team of Carl Skipper 
and Martin Sweitzer placed 
eighth out of nine teams. Amanda 
Talbott placed fifth out of nine 
teams in the Club Singles race. 
The Mixed Doubles team of 
Kirsten Buttler and Fritz Mor­
gan placed fifth of 12 teams.
The Tartans placed fourth out 
of seven teams in the Women’s
Club Four event, just behindMIT. 
Theboatwas coxswained by Alan 
Kline, and the rowers were Diana 
Yu, Erin Burr, Joanne Wei and 
Kristine Royal. The team also did 
exceptional in the Men’s Club 
Four, racing three teams. The 
Tartan’s A boat placed second, 
beating Michigan University and 
bringing home a silver medal for 
the club — the boat was 
coxswained by Oliver Sung and 
the rowers were Ben Fry, Klaus 
Moser, Todd Stevenson, and 
Julian Kinal. The B team placed 
ninth of the 17 teams, coxswained 
by Klein and rowed by Jimmy 
Chang, Tom Price, Jeff Willey, 
and Peter Moore. The B team 
defeated rival school Marietta 
College. The C boat, a boat com­
prised of club team alumni, placed 
12th. The club also ran men’s and 
women’s Club Eight teams, who
had strong showings. “[The com­
petition] was basically a gutsy 
effort,” said Moser. “We didn’t 
have as much practice as we 
wanted ... so we needed to pull 
through on guts and experience.” 
Maples said, “Its great to see 
the work the crews are putting in 
paying off.... They’ve come to­
gether well under the new coach­
ing staff [this season].”
The crew team’s next competi­
tion will be the Head of the 
Speakmon in Columbus, Ohio on 
October 26. Co-head coach Casa 
Hadley is looking forward to the 
next event, because, “We have a 
good-looking Novice squad, and 
the Head of the Speakmon will be 
their first race.” Moser said, “We 
expect a lot of really strong show­
ings from [the novices] ... they 
look like they could pull a boat 
through well.”

of Rochester, ranked second in 
the UAA last season. The 
women’s team is poised for an 
excellent season, if they continue 
their current intensity on the 
playing field.
The offense makes stunning 
plays when least expected — 
take three overtime goals at the 
September 17 game against 
Grove City, for example. During 
last year’s season, the Tartans 
consistently lost games in over­
time; this year, they have ended 
up with a stellar record of three 
overtime wins, one overtime tie, 
and no overtime losses. “Over­
time just killed us last season,” 
said coach Ann Haggerty after 
the September 14 game against 
Case Western Reserve Univer­
sity. “It’s a big mental block for

against St. Mary’s College, the 
Tartan backfielders formed 3

only a few exceptions, did not let 
St. Mary’s ball into the back half 
of Tartan territory. “Overall; 
we've been doing really well as a 
team so far,” said deRosset. I 
think that we have a lot of talent 
this season.”

Crime trends change 
throughout the years
By SHARMDLA VENKATASUBBAN
CaoMae BtaMcoti ’lnMSo
By the first week of school a crime alert posted to a CMU 1 b.board read, “In Cyert Hall, someone entered... an office 
i complex and removed two Powerbooks.”
Cdt Svvnbt sai ce6Sbrtl ael ceaMMteltl2 it said.
It also read, “Between 8 am and 2 pm, person(s) un­
known removed a wallet from a purse at the UTDC on 
Henry Street... When she returned the wallet was miss­
ing.”
Cdt •nbMnf iMtwwtl asa7 voSf Mdt Svvnbt vSo a fnecMt2 the 
post read.
According to James Lapaglia, Chief of Security at CMU, 
most police reports involving thefts read similarly — 
someone leaves their belongings unattended to make a 
bathroom run or leaves their dorm room unlocked while 
they dash to the Coke machine, only to have valuable items 
stolen in the interim.
While Lapaglia is happy that CMU students don’t live in 
fear, he worries that students aren’t taking the necessary 
precautions to protect themselves from crime on campus.
“The number one crime on campus is theft and 85—95% 
of it is theft with no visible forced entry,” said Lapaglia. 
“This means that students aren’t taking the necessary 
precautions to prevent crime, they don’t think it’s going to 
happen to them.”
“We’re no different from any other campus in the coun­
try,” he said. “Crime does happen here and it’s important 
that students are aware of it.”
In September alone, 15 bicycle thefts were reported to 
Campus police; the majority of these crimes were not 
committed by students, said Lapaglia.
“Our experience is that the people we are catching are 
between the ages of 30 and 40 with drug abuse problems,” 
he said. Lapaglia said one bike thief was arrested last 
week, after a three-year career of stealing bicycles on 
campus.
Campus Police has increased the number of “plain clothed 
officers on duty this semester since the number of on- 
campus thefts has increased.
While bicycles were hit hard this year, computer compo­
nents were the popular item in previous semesters. “Over 
$115,000 worth of computer equipment were stolen during 
the last school year—most of which was stolen by the same 
students,” said Lapaglia.
Last year three CMU students removed memory chips 
from Power Macintosh computers in Wean Hall’s 5419 
cluster; the alleged perpetrators will be on trial next 
! Tuesday, said Lapaglia.
Since that incident, the number of computer thefts has- 
significantly decreased, due in part to the publicity of the 
| event and in part to the changes in computer memory 
storage within the last year, LaPaglia said.
“Memory chips are not as expensive as they used to be,” 
he added.
As far as assaults on campus, Lapaglia said that CMU is 
very lucky because students don’t have the same severity

Campus police, 
Pittsburgh cops offer 
different resources
t ]
By AMANDA SPEAR
CaoMae UMavvsonMto
“When it comes to criminal stuff, we have the same 
procedures as the P.P.D. [Pittsburgh Police Depart­
ment!, the same authority as the P.P.D., the same 
arrest powers,” said Detective Raymond Mialki of 
the Carnegie Mellon campus police. He has been a 
full-time detective here since 1981 and worked within 
the Carnegie Mellon police before that as a dis­
patcher and an officer. “People make the mistake of 
thinking we’re not ‘real’ cops, but when we put real 
handcuffs on them and they go before a real magis­
trate, they see their mistake.”
The Carnegie Mellon police force operates as do 
many municipal police departments across the coun­
try; however they offer many services that municipal 
police ordinarily do not. For example, they will come 
and let you into your room or campus apartment if 
you are locked out. A city police department would 
not. Students can get rides from the CMU police late 
at night, and if a student is stranded off campus, can’t 
get home and is without money for a cab, they can call 
CMU police. They have an agreement with the 
Yellow Cab company that has been in effect for 15 to 
20 years said Mialki. An officer will call the cab 
company, who then sends a cab to pick up the student 
and bring him or her back to campus. The student’s 
university account is then billed for the fare.
Mialki explained CMU police are dealing with a 
more specific populace than the P.P.D. “We have to 
deal with people in a certain age range, for the most 
part, who are all here with the same purpose. In a i 
neighborhood like Oakland, you’ve got all ages and' 
all professions; and the dynamic is different.”

Winners of the scholarship receive 
$27,000 for graduate school and $3,000 
for their senior year of undergraduate 1 school. To be eligible to apply for the 
Truman Scholarship, a student must be

as scholarship winners, every participant

“The very process of applying for a

cess also has the very practical ben­
efits of sharpening writing, analyti­
cal, and interviewing skills, and put­
ting students into closer working rela­

CMU has had the honor of having 
one of its students win the scholar­
ship. Terry Lumish, a senior policy 
and management major, is a 1996 
recipient of the Truman Scholarship. 
Lumish said her experience as a 
Truman Scholar has been exhilarat­
ing as well as valuable. :
“It has been an amazing year-long 
process. The people I’ve met are wonder­
ful. This program gave me a chance to 
meet people with similar interests. Be­
ing brought together with the future 
leaders of this country has been such an 
exciting experience,” she said.
This past summer, Lumish had the 
opportunity to meet all the current schol­
ars as well as past recipients. The 
Truman Scholars Leadership Week is 
held in Independence, Mo. every June. 
The conference gives the scholars a 
chance to collaborate on projects and 
meet each other. Lumish said the week
was fun and educational.
She said, “This was a great time for all 
of the scholars to get together and meet 
each other. We worked on policy and 
analysis projects. We attended workshops 
on what to look for in graduate school. We 
focused on different aspects of working in

Ocogd NSiM EaJtMMt2 came to 
CMU last Thursday and gave a 
talk about the humor in politics, 
makinguse ofhis numerous and 
humorous editorial cartoons. 
The talk was sponsored by the 
National Affairs Organization.
Rogers’ work is frequently re­
printed in Cdt yts £Sor Cnfti2 
Cdt uaidnegMSe NSiM2 4UY CSW
la72 and ytsisttr8 In 
ytsisttr9i end-of-the-year is­
sue, “1995 in Cartoons,” many 
ofhis works were displayed, and 
one of his cartoons, “How the 
Gingrich Stole Christmas,” was 
chosen as the cover of the 
magazine’s inaugural cartoon 
edition lastyear. Newt Gingrich 
happens to be one of Rogers’ 
favorite caricatures to draw.
Rogers has won a multitude 
of awards, including the Golden 
Quill, and his works often con­
tribute to the collection “Best
Editorial Car­
toons of the 
Year.” 
Rogers 
eamedhis Mas­
ter of Fine Arts 
Degree at 
Carnegie 
Mellon Univer­
sity, and his un­
dergraduate de- 
gree at the Uni­
versity of Cen­
tral Oklahoma.
Rogers said 
that he has not 
drawn a cartoon 
about CMU for 
quite a while, 
though he has 
recently drawn 
some cartoons 
centered 
around the Uni­
versity of Cen­
tral Oklahoma.
People often 
ask Rogers 
where he gets his ideas for his 
cartoons. “I’m always amused 
when people ask me because they 
ask me in such a matter of factway 
... like’wheredoyougetyourshirts 
or underwear?’ ” he said.
Rogers illustratedhiswordswith 
many slides ofhis cartoons.
“Normally, you have to be very 
patient and wait, and sometimes 
you’re even going to have to stalk 
an idea,” said Rogers as he showed 
a cartoon slide of himself trying to 
catch an idea light bulb in a trap.
“Other times, you may have an 
idea sitting in the back of your 
head. You know what the topic is, 
you know what direction it’s going 
to go, but itjust doesn’t quite want 
to come out yet,” said Rogers, as he 
put up a cartoon slide of himself 
with a huge pregnant belly.
“It’s kind of like giving birth, so 
it can be a frustrating process, but 
there’s nothingprouder than a car­
toonist with a newborn idea,” said 
Rogers.
Rogers found much of interest 
in the Russian elections.
“I went to Moscow during the 
election there to get a feel for it. 
First of ail, it’s the first REAL 
democratic election. The lastone 
was not really officially truly 
democratic,” said Rogers.
Hefounditinterestingtodraw 
many caricatures of both Rus­
sian and American political fig­
ures.
He said that sometimes, the 
politicians actually appeared to 
be caricatures of the cartoons, 
rather than the other way 
around.
Sometimes he does not have 
to do much work to come up 
with a cartoon idea.
Rogers said thathesometimes 
can just look at a newspaper or 
photographs, and the idea ap­
pears.
“I opened the newspaper and 
saw [Pat Buchanan] standing 
in from of Mt. Rushmore. He 
was actually saying, 'Who 
knows, someday, you’ll see me 
up there,’ and that’s how I came 
up with this idea,” said Rogers.
Rogers said that he usually 
spends a few hours every mom- 
inglookingthroughnewspapers 
and other media to look for a 
new idea.
When he has to draw a new 
caricature or cartoon, he might 
sometimes go through a dozen 
revisions before he is finally 
satisfied with it.
However he is well-practiced 
with many ofhis popular cari­
catures. He even drew many 
differentfaces, from Bill Clinton 
to Boris Yeltsin, during his talk 
at CMU.
Rogers particularly ad­
mires Gary Larson, the car­
toonist of the “Far Side” com­
ics, and finds Larson’s hu­
mor inspiring.
“He's [LarsonJ got such a 
warped sense of humor and a 
warped mind ... that’s where 
as cartoonists, we all strive 
to go, but we can’t quite get 
there. But he does, all the 
time.”

reads as past of Banned Books Week.
By DIADO MACK
CaoMae pcenSo UMavvsonMto
Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union 
sponsored a local eight-day event to honor banned 
books. Its intentions were to raise public aware­
ness of the removal of books, some which have 
become staples of American life and culture, from 
schools and libraries in an attempt to limit their 
availability to people of all ages.
The event was held between September 28 and 
October 5, and was sponsored in conjunction with 
the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Ie NnMMiOcogd 
uttr67, WYEP, and Borders Books and Music.
John Fedele, the development coordinator of 
fundraising and membership for the ACLU said 
local celebrities were used to publicly attract people 
to the readings. The celebrities were picked by a 
25-member board that planned the event.
Honoring banned books was started on the na­
tional level by the American Library Association 
in the late ’80s.
However, this is the first year that the event has 
been held in Pittsburgh. Local celebrities read 
passages from a number of well-known and con­
troversial books at various locations.
Last Tuesday, Jim Sweeney and Ted Sohier of 
WQED Radio read excerpts from $cbr6tOtoo7 Bnee 
at the Carnegie Library.
On Saturday Kate Granneman read parts of Cdt 
5aMbdto ne Mdt ­7t at Heads Together/Bookworm. 
Some of the sites where readings were held in­
cluded Borders Book and Music, in North Hills 
and South Hills, and Jay’s Bookstall.

On Wednesday, Bob Hoover, book editor for the 
NnMMiOcogd NSiM!EaJtMMt2 read “Autobiography,” a 
poem by Lawrence Ferlenghetti, at the Carnegie 
Library.
It is part ofhis collection of works, 5Set7 Ii6ael 
Sv Mdt znel8
Ferlenghetti was a beat poet in Jl’an Francisco in 
the ’50s, one of the most famous a id controver­
sial because he wrote against the sou al mores of 
the time. Banned by a high school in Illinois and 
prevented from publication by the University oft« 
Chicago, 5Set7 Ii6ael was eventually published 
by an independent publisher in Chicago. Ap­
proximately 800,000 copies are currently in print.
Stephanie Birnberg, who also sat on the board 
said many people don’t know that books are still 
being banned from schools and libraries. j
“All it takes is one or two people to complain, 
it doesn’t take a whole community,” she said. 
“[The importance of honoring banned books is 
that] culture has been transmitted through the 
ages, by literature,” she said.
The most recent local case of book banning 
happened at a junior high school in New 
Brighton. Cdt honlgt MS CtoaOnMdna and pc6nt Sv 
Mdt uS6•ti were the two books banned from the 
curriculum.
Fedele said the readings held at the book­
stores were more popular, while the ones at the 
library weren’t as well attended.
He added that the ACLU isn’t discouraged, 
and plans to make this an annual event, with 
more advertising and some different sites on 
local college campuses. .

respectable time on the Stairmaster is virtually a rite of passage. Working out 
is another way to “be good” or to make up for doing something “bad,” like eating 
a hefty meal. Working out regularly is admittedly good for you, but it seems 
to be getting out of hand. Especially since most exercise machines have 
displays that facilitate a woman’s impulse to see how many calories she’s 
burning.
There are even aerobics videos for pre-teen girls. Working out reasonably for 
general health is one thing, but obsessively gazing into the Stairmaster’s 
calorie counter, seeking redemption is another.
And there is an increasingly fine line between health and compulsion. 
Exercise bulimia, where a woman purges by doing dangerously excessive 
amounts of exercise instead of vomiting or ¿busing laxatives, is on the rise. 
Due to their obsession with aerobic fitness, women’s complex relationships 
with food often gets played out in the ways they treat and punish their bodies.
It’s no new or shocking revelation that women are pressured to live up to an 
unreasonable beauty standard. What is disturbingly consequential is that this 
pressure affects their everyday relationship with their bodies in ways that are 
mentally and, in some cases, physically unhealthy. The mainstream is cruel 
to those who don’t fit the mold. I certainly don’t blame any woman who finds 
herself in the food-depriving, exercise-craving mindset; I fall into it myself. 
But there has to be a better way.
It’s true that fitness is important, but moderation is the key. Many women 
are depriving themselves of reasonable pleasure and punishing themselves in 
the gym. While eating disorders are a very serious problem, it’s not only 
women with -eating disorders who torture themselves with food-related guilt: 
Women need to divorce their concepts of themselves from their relationship 
with food, and this is especially stifling for women whose bodies differ from the 
culturally praised body.
Nineties good girls order diet pop, no butter, dressing on the side, low-fat 
everything, and they top that fulfilling meal off with a trip to the gym. It’s 
disturbing that, in many ways, women’s eating is becoming almost as op­
pressed as sexuality was before the sexual revolution, all to maintain the 
upholding of some unreasonable body ideal. For women, the cliche “you are what 
you eat” has gone too far. Those fries are not going to kill you.

Women stifle hunger due to negative perceptionsMentors provide support system
By ENA KHAN
CaoMae »n•toinSei ’lnMSo
The local chapter of the American Council on Educa­
tion, National Identification Program (ACE-NIP) 
has restructured their organization to fit the chang­
ing needs of women at CMU. The group, renamed 
Women Supporting Women, is dedicated to the well 
being and success of women in the community — 
more specifically, women on the CMU staff.
Now in its sixth year, the 11 women on this year’s 
planning board felt it was time to reform the organiza­
tion by setting specific goals. The group has selected a 
new motto to emphasize these goals.
The mission statement expresses the group’s de­
sire “to promote the professional and 
personal goals of CMU women.”
Their focus is to “establish career 
development opportunities, facilitate 
professional enrichment, and fos 
ter a supportive environment for 
women.”
Keeping these goals in mind,
Women Supporting Women spon­
sors various activities through­
out the year. Guest speakers are 
often invited to speak at lun­
cheons which focus on topics 
geared toward working women.
Last year, speakers discussed is­
sues such as “health, financial strat­
egies, and skill development,” said 
Barbara Smith, the assistant vice- 
president for human resources at CMU 
and a member of the group’s planning
board. For Women’s History Month, theliii i i iii ii j Simona Lo/Tartangroup held a luncheon where old letters and
diaries of women and their relatives were read.
“Lunch is the best time [to have the events ] ... which are 
held quarterly,” said Smith.
Busy CMU women are able to enjoy the company of their 
colleagues and listen to informative speeches during a conve­
nient hour.
This year plans have been made to continue sponsoring 
the successful luncheons. An upcoming luncheon on 
October 10 will focus on the problems of the “Sandwich 
Generation.”
Issues such asmanagingchildren, agingparents, and 
a simultaneous career will be addressed.
It will be held in the Connan Room of the University Center 
from noon to 1 pm.
Although the activities are open to all women, the groups 
primary interest is to reach women on the staff.
Other activities sponsored by the organization include a 
mentoring program and a monthly newsletter. The 
mentoring program, which is now in its 
third year, is designed to pair together 
women with similar professional and 
personal interests. “We facilitate 
the matching of the mentees and 
mentors,” Smith said.
The 20 active participants meet 
through their own initiative.
A typical pair would be com­
prised of one woman with more 
working experience than another 
as the mentor and mentee respec­
tively. The women do not have to 
work in the same department or 
havesimilarprofessions, only com­
mon interests and desire, to sup­
port each other. ,
AllisonRiley, assistantdirectorof Stu-- 
dent Life and a member of the group’s 
planning board, said, “[Women Support­
ing Women] provides different opportuni­
ties for staff women to come together.” - 
With a new name and mission statement, Women Supporting 
Women has created a strong foundation with which to promote 
the well-being and success of women in the community. |

Fences around Cut ruin atmosphere
Women have a very complex rela­
tionship with food. All over America, 
women are trying to convince them­
selves that mega-reduced-fat goodies 
like chips and cookies are really, re­
ally tasty. Why? Because women can 
eat thèse things and still be “good.” 
Generally, for men, hunger is a situa- 
5­Y5KIyE C$’ z£C$ tion to be immediately resolved. For 
O• 5doniM• $nSbdte many women, it poses a dilemma. This 
. is because for women, self-worth
equals self-denial.
All the time, I hear women sayingthings like, “Oh, I was so good today. I only 
ate a bagel,:’ or, “Should I be good or should I order dessert?” Magazines give 
articles with low-fat eating ideas titles like “Ten ways to be good.” Frozen 
yogurt has “all of the flavor, none of the guilt.” These phrases all conjure up the 
same idea: extreme food-caution is good, but cravings are bad, food is bad, 
indulgence is bad. The media applies this notion much more to women than to 
men. A telling example is the commercial for Baked Lays chips, which shows 
supermodels chowing down, declaring, “You can eat like one of the guys and 
still look like one of the girls.” So, women are not supposed to eat without 
remorse, like men can. Commercials for the extremely popular Snackwells 
show only women obsessively buying the product, and ads for diet pills feature 
women much more often than men. Women are constantly portrayed as needing 
strict discipline in matters of food. The unfortunate consequence is that much of 
a woman’s self-worth is directly related to their relationship to food.
Coinciding with this obsession of ascetic eating habits is an obsession with 
aerobic fitness. America is becoming this hÿper-aerobic culture where a

Location, location, location — it’s the 
three most important things when se­
lecting real estate, and it’s pretty high 
up on the list when selecting a univer­
sity as well. Personally, I didn’t want a 
city school. NYU and all its imitators 
were off the list. At the same time, coun­
try-side schools where getting to a city 
meant first getting someone with a trac­
tor to drop you off at the bus stop, were 
also off the list.
Carnegie Mellon offered a nice in be­
tween. With downtown Pittsburgh just 
15 minutes away I felt that CMU was 
close enough to some kind of city. Also, 
there’s Oakland, Shadyside, and Squirrel 
Hill all within walking distance. The world 
definitely feels tangible at CMU. How­
ever, the university itself is still pretty

Herstories gives women a chance to explore careers, lives
v/'scio“ '

*9aoMae YiiniMaeM BtaMcoti ’lnMSo
On Saturday, graduate and faculty 
omen of Carnegie Mellon had the 
ipportunity to attend workshops and 
lectures which shared personal sto- 
ies of success and academic sur- 
ival from women withinrthe campus 
ommunity.
Herstories” is a symposium that 
s been designed with the purpose 
if addressing challenges faced by 
-omen both in academia, especially 
if the graduate level, and in their 
irst job experience.
This is accomplished while main- 
|aining an atmosphere conducive to 
ipen discussion.
This program began within the 
echnical departments, but it soon 
iroadened because of the high level 
f interest demonstrated by the over- 
ill community.
The event was free to members of 
¡he Carnegie Mellon community due 
grants from the Pennsylvania 
Jpace Grant Consortium and the col­
leges within CMU.
The day opened with registration 
nd a continental breakfast; partici- 
iants chose three one-hour workshops 
Tom 18 possibilities.
Possible topics ranged from general 
nterest career information, as seen 
?rom the woman’s perspective, to prob­
lems exclusive to women in 
the career field. Each work- 
shop had two to three 
women faculty and/or 
graduate students on the 
panel to discuss their expe­
riences with the topic at 
hand.
This year stands as the 
fourth graduate women’s 
conference held at Carnegie 
Mellon University.
An introduction was given 
by Barbara B. Lazarus, as­
sociate provost for aca­
demic projects, who along 
with Kathleen Minadeo 
Johnson, special projects co­
ordinator, can be credited 
for this day as well as for 
many similar programs.
“[They] run ¡a lot of pro­
grams and ... special 
projects as1 related to 
women and minorities,” 
said Sara liiajetich, key­
note speaker and associate 
professor, Physics.
Majetich said that, she,
“spoke at every conference, but not as 
the keynote,” and she used the oppor­
tunity $0 give a speech, “based with 
lots of cartoons on how to handle ‘the 
little things’1 with humor.” Majetich 
attended thrpe workshops.
The workshop sessions provided an

Herstories symposium dedicated a day to discuss gender concerns and issues for graduate 
students and staff.
opportunity for all women graduate 
students, post-doctoral fellows, faculty 
women and interested seniors and jun­
iors to share their own experiences bn 
the issues discussed. The symposium 
was advertised through invitations to 
all graduate and faculty of CMU and
electronic mail to undergraduates.
Julie Park, an undergraduate se­
nior majoring in biology said, “I found 
the deeper insight into graduate life to 
be the most informative aspect of the 
program... [I] didn’t realize how much 
harder it is for women, especially in
the lecture 5dn6loteL USSeto So - 
GaMto8H On the subject of home ' 
parenting and gender issues, 
Johnson said, “There will be a 
whole generation of men that will 
start pushing demands [to con­
tribute more equally] at home.” • 
Katya Strinka, undergraduate: 
senior, civil and environmental en- / 
gineering and engineering and- 
public policy, said, “I’m a senior 
and will be making some very im- X 
portant decisions about my life. It 
was very important and helpful to 
hear from women who have had to 
make these decisions and seen the 
outcome of those decisions.”
The day ended with lunch in the 
Connan Room and closing remarks 
were given by Susan McNeil, pro­
fessor, Civil and Environmental 
Engineering.
This program is not a one-time 
thing and Lazarus uged the com­
munity to take advantage of up­
coming programs through the As­
sociate Provost for Academic 
Projects.
Lazarus said, “There is some­
thing very special about this commu­
nity (of women) that we have so many 
women who will come out on their own 
time to contribute to this 
(program)...Women are supportive to 
each other here, this is an amazingly 
generous community for women.”

Police offer help to students
POUCH, from page LI
CMU police try to be sensitive to this and deal 
with problems accordingly. There are on-campus 
groups that a student can be referred to iii cases 
of rape or sexual assault, as well as broader off- 
campus organizations. Problems involving two 
CMU students (be it rape, assault, harassment, 
or anything else) can be handled internally if the 
victim doesn’t want to go through the criminal 
justice process, which is a primary contrast be­
tween Carnegie Mellon police and city police 
departments.
However, if the incident is off campus and does 
not involve another CMU student, the Pitts­
burgh Police should be called. Carnegie Mellon 
police don’t have jurisdiction over cases that are off 
campus. The Pittsburgh police should also be called 
if the victim wishes to press criminal charges.
“Fortunately, the frequency of violent crime on 
campus is very low,” Mialki clarified, so that most 
problems that are not resolved internally involve 
state alcohol citations. “The biggest problem on 
campus, in terms of security, is property crimes, 
mostly thefts.”
He had this advice for students, “Three quarters 
of thefts are through unlocked doors. Lock your 
doors, even if you’re just going to the bathroom or 
down the hall for a second.”

Pop star takes the stage at Heinz
By JOHN BIGGS
CaoMae BSocf ’lnMSo
Something terrible happened last week: Bree7 
Eno6 opened at Heinz Hall. But before I thrash the 
undeniable zwieback that is this musical, I’d like to 
get a few things said.
Keep your eyes on the Pittsburgh Broadway 
Series’ This venerable organization brings Broad­
way, shows to Penn Avenue and stages them in the 
venerable Heinz Hall, home of the.Pittsburghpym- 
phony Orchestra. The venue is large and inipres- 
sive. The past productions have been grand (Knii Sv 
Mdt Uwnlto uSfae2 for example). And the ¡price, 
more often than not, has been fair and allows 
students to take a bit of a breather and enjoy a fine 
production. In fact, this year the Broadway Series 
features UfSrt7 pSt*i 5avt, a rock and roll revue, 
as well as znii UangSe in August. This ni not to 
mention weeks and weeks of orchestral perfor­
mances and other shows put on at Heinz Hall.
However, Debbie Gibson (the SMdto /Tiffany) is 
back in action with this latest production. Bcee7 
Eno62 it seems, was a vehicle for Barbara Streisand 
before henfameL This is clear, and everything from
the dialogue to the story points to this fact. How­
ever, Debbie “Electric Youth” Gibson is no Bar­
bara Streisand, and this musical did not cause me 
to shake my love.
While some may have been lost in Gibson’s 
eyes, there was little for me to take away from this 
production. The sets were ill-defined and bland. 
The characters were boring, and the motivations 
were buried under a morass of tap dancing and a 
poor story. Written by Isobel Lennart, Jule Styne, 
and Bob Merrill, the tale is one of woe. It features 
the true story of Fanny Brice (Gibson), a young 
Jewish girl from Brooklyn who makes it big by 
sheer force of will. Then her life takes on a foolish 
beat. She drops a big lug of a guy, Eddie Ryan 
(Jonathon Brody), to be with a little whippet of a 
rich guy, Nick Arnstein (Robert Westenberg).
Nick is a self-made man who runs around try­
ing to keep himself rich. He can’t handle the 
strong and undying love of Fanny. He marries her 
and buys her a house and as she rises to stardom, 
he drops like the number in the audience after 
intermission.
Nothing about this musical is memorable. The 
acting was staid and stolid. The songs had tunes.
The dancing was agile 
and nimble. The garish 
production numbers 
were garish and the 
emotional numbers had 
emotion. Overall, it was 
not a pretty sight.
Evidently, this musi­
cal had a rocky begin­
ning. It opened in March 
1964 and won eight 
Tony Awards. However, 
it has only now resur­
faced as a Broadway 
contended. Unfortu­
nately, it is a fly-weight 
trying to bulk up before 
the fight with a heavy­
weight. It might be a 
valiant effort, but it’s 
hopeless.
But let us look be­
yond Bcee7 Eno68 The 
Pittsburgh Broadway 
Series has been consis­
tent in its production 
of fine shows for years. 
There’s always tomor­
row, and, as Debbie 
Gibson once sang, it 
might come “out of the 
blue.”

Heinz continues tradition of excellence in entertainment
By REENA SINGHAL
CaoMae pcenSo UMavvsonMto
Each year, more than a half million people enter 
Pittsburgh’s Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts 
to attend symphony concerts and other high­
lighted events, ranging from jazz f e s t i -
vals to children’s productions 
and national Broadway tour­
ing shows. This season Heinz 
Hall celebrates its 25th anni­
versary, still upholding its in­
ternational reputation for 
grandeur and excellence as a 
concert hall and a showplace.
Built in 1927 by motion pic­
ture magnate Marcus Loew, the 
Hall was originally known as 
Loew’s Penn Theater, a movie 
house from 1927 to 1964 that 
presented films as well as nu­
merous vaudeville and stage 
shows. In those days, the The­
ater was known as Pittsburgh’s 
“Temple of the Cinema,” re­
garded as the best theater 
betwe en Ne w York and Chi­
cago. Unfortunately, with 
the invention of the tele­
vision and the promi­
nent increasing costs of 
maintaining such a 
grand building, the 
Theater was forced to 
close.
After closing, it re­
mained vacant for five years 
and Pittsburgh considered 
demolishing the 
nearly-destroyed 
building to use 
the space 
for a park­
ing lot.
Then, 
when the 
Pittsburgh 
Symphony Soci­
ety was searching for a 
new home, the Howard Heinz 
Endowment Foundation noted 
the Penn Theater as a possible loca­
tion for them. The Society saw the numerous 
advantages to recycling and renovating a well- 
constructed theater, so Henry J. Heinz II and 
Charles Denby, the President of the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Society, walked through the rundown
Simona Lo/ Tartan Co-Art Editor
theater and soon envisioned a brilliant cultural 
center for Pittsburgh. For the following three years, 
over ten million dollars were spent on renovations 
of the building with much of the interior work 
being done by hand by local craftsmen and arti­
sans. On September 10,1971, the newly-restored 
building was reopened and dedicated as Heinz 
Hall for the Performing Arts.
This season, Heinz Hall again opens its doors 
with many new features and renovations to cel­
ebrate its 25th anniversary. The renovation be- 
gining in May 1995, was to cost 6.5 million dollars 
to enhance the acoustical and aesthetical qualities 
as well as the audiovisual capabilities of Heinz 
Hall. Frank Catanzano, the director of communi­
cations for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, 
said “[Heinz Hall is] one of the finest halls in the 
world as far as acoustics.”
The renovations also included building a shell 
and acoustical risers to enable the audience to see 
and hear the orchestra more clearly. The 
proscenium was widenedby eight feet and raised 
by six feet to allow the orchestra to play in a 
wider range and closer to the audience. A
new sound reflector was installed
quality 
through­
out the 
building. 
Even the heating 
and air conditioning 
systems were changed 
to eliminate any distur­
bances in the performances 
and any background noise. “All 
of [these renovations] have en­
hanced the acoustical qualities of - 
Heinz Hall,” Catanzano said. 
Restorations in 1995 also fur- 1 
ther enhanced the Hall aestheti- 
cally as the gold leaves which ' 
decorate the interior of the Hall 
were all restored. More than 
700 gallons of paint were ap- • 
plied to the lobby areas by the 
paint contractor who did the 
original painting in 1971. The 
unique Golden Triangle carpet­
ing in the Lobby was replaced by 
an identical carpet, again sewn by 
the same person as the original carpet in 
1971. Each of the 2,661 seats were refurbished to 
ensure the comfortability of the audience, and the 
placards on the seats were even improved for 
better readability. New glass partition vestibules 
were installed for any latecomers to the perfor-

Posner showcases student art
gy Vollu me9V1.I
vaoMae pcenSo UMavvsonMto
Art is probably not the first thing that leaps into your mind when 
you think about the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at 
CMU. In most circumstances this may be justified, but until Wednes­
day, people who wander into Posner Hall, the main GSIA building, 
will be in for an artistic treat. The Posner Hall gallery is showing 
' “Enigmatic Incidents,” a collection of paintings and drawings by 
Denise Soultanian, an art major/IM minor in CMtPs fifth-year 
j. scholar program. This exhibit is an outgrowth of a group-showing of 
art students’ work in Posner Hall last year, in which her pieces won 
I heavy praise. Looking at this show, it’s easy to see why.
Most of Soultanian’s work in mediums that enhance the fea- 
! tures of big-eyed, tiny-bodied cartoonish creatures. At first glance,
¦ they look a little like cuddly aliens, or maybe Maggie 
i Simpson. Yet, another look reveals the underlying 
- complexity of her images.
Soultanian’s paintings are many-layered in more 1 ways than one. She covers her canvases with coat 
i after coat of paint and the odd dash of chalk, char- 
i coal, or another medium. She fits many images and 
suggestions of images into a single canvas, in ways 
j that are intriguing but impossible to begin to deci- 
- pher. A picture typically contains some of her crea-
¦ tures or other recognizable figures in the foreground,
) sharing the space with scrawled words, smaller fig- 1 ures, and doodles floating in the background.
The critical essay hanging on the wall mentions 
antecedents to Soultanian’s work in the 1980s Neo- 
Expressionists. This may very well be true, but her 
i paintings also echo Marc Chagall’s in their vivid 
I colors, fanciful mood, and objects drifting freely 
i around the picture space.
I A boy sits in the center of “Thinking,” appearing, 
i from his outstretched arms and the small objects and 
! figures around his head, to literally juggle his 
thoughts. The canvas is full of rich reds, blues, and 
< yellows. “Girl” is more menacing than most of * hallway In
Season’s new TV shows fall short
Soultanian’s work; it features the girl of the title with her body 
spread out and her mouth open in terror. A gun and a frightening- 
looking face take up nearly half of the canvas.
Soultanian’s drawings resemble her paintings in mood and 
imagery, but have a more delicate feel to them. They are done 
with pen and ink on translucent paper and mounted on scraps of 
maps or other things for a collage effect.
Many of her drawings seem to convey an appreciation of the 
people and the world around us. The “Shadow Man” smiles down 
at his shadow, which appears to be grinning back. In “You Okay,” 
one of her little people has his arm around another, in a gesture 
of comfort or reassurance.
The rich colors, cryptic, complex imagery, and creativity of 
Soultanian’s work make for a memorable artistic experience. It’s 
definitely worth a detour to Posner Hall.

While their shows aren’t likely 
to win awards, Potts’ and 
Perlman’s series are, at least, 
watchable. The same cannot be 
said for the vehicles starring 
Brooke Shields, Molly Ringwald, 
and Rachel Blanchard. Shields 
©y C$’ C4h’ stars as a magazine columnist in 
Ucllte67 Uciae (NBC, Thurs- 
Dy Ddn ROSGHberg days, 9:30-10 pm), a simply dread­
ful sitcom that even the delightful 
Shields can’t rescue. In addition to 
being one of the worst shows of the 
new season, Uciae has the honor 
of making the worst casting deci­
sion this year—replacingthe great 
Elizabeth Ashley ¥’•teneg Udaltx 
with, of all people, Judd Nelson.
At least Uciae has Shields, a 
woman who can do comedy. 
Ringwald and her ensemble are 
unwatchable in CSsenti (ABC, 
Wednesdays, 8:30-9), a sitcom 
that’s just as bad as ’66te2 the 
show that precedes it. This show is 
abdut as enjoyable as a final exam 
in quantum physics. One comes to 
expect more from the Carsey- 
Werner production company, 
which created two of the best 
sitcoms of the ’80s, Cdt 5SiO7 UdSs 
and ­Sitaeet8
Even worse than CSsenti (yes, 
it’s possible) is the horrible TV 
version of Amy Heckerling’s 
56ct6tii (ABC, Fridays, 9 — 9:30 
pm), a mediocre film that was 
worthseeingsolelyfortheenchant- 
ing performance of Alicia 
Silverstone. Silverstone, however, 
had the good sense to stay away 
from this dud, so the producers 
replaced her with the relatively 
unknown Blanchard ¥Yot £Sc 
Yvoanl Sv Mdt »aor _x8 The fact that 
the show is so awful can’t be blamed 
on Blanchard, however. The terri­
bly written program couldn’t get 
any worse had Dom DeLuise re­
placed Silverstone. How could 
Oscar nominee Michael Lemer 
¥haoMSe Bnerx and Wallace Shawn 
%zcowd7 hoSsex sign on to this 
catastrophe? Had NBC not picked 
up zte htda•neg hal672 this 
would be the worst new show of 
the season.
The last great regularly sched­
uled television series that did not 
have a male lead was zcowd7 
[ hoSse2 which debuted in 1988. 
On the other hand, the last great 
show that did not possess a fe- 
; male in a starring role was zcoW
lto ©et2 which premiered 13 
months ago. Hoping to end this 
eight-year drought, the Big Three 
networks are giving some of their 
best time slots to new series star­
ring women. Unfortunately, the 
most these new programs can 
aspire to is mediocrity.
The best of the lot is »aegtoSci 
zneli (ABC, Mondays, 8-9 pm), 
the series version of the hit 
Michelle Pfeiffer film about an 
ex-Marine teaching at an inner- 
city high school. The series has a 
lot going for it, most notably star 
Annie Potts ¥»tingeneg uSftex 
; and producer Jerry Bruckheimer 
¡(who also produced this year’s 
blockbuster, Cdt­Sbrx8 However, 
the program is simply another 
“teacher-who-cares” cliché in the 
same mold as last year’s ill-fated 
zaMM uaMtoi8 Potts is great, but 
the show needs work. Even the 
appearance of rapper Coolio in 
the pilot couldn’t save the maud­
lin script.
Another disappointment is 
Ntao6 (CBS, Wednesdays, 8:30-9 
Pm), the new sitcom starring 
5dttoi* Rhea Perlman. The Eye 
Network has expressed a lot of 
confidence in this rookie, currently 
pairing it with 5SiO7 on Mondays 
and then coupling it with Cdt 
yaee7 on Wednesdays beginning 
°n October 23. That confidence is 
displaced. 6=rt »aegtoSci zneli2 
Ntao6 has a great lead but does not 
have strong scripts to support her. 
Perlman is aces as a middle-aged 
widow who returns to college, but 
the wonderful Carol Kane ¥Ca0nx 
^ wasted as her sister-in-law. 
Kevin Corrigan’s portrayal of 
Perlman’s son is flatter than Wile 
E. Coyote after an boulder lands 
on him. Màlcom McDowell (A

ficult task of making Perlman’s

Critic raves about new Tool album
By RYAN DONOVAN
CaoMae UMavvsonMto
You may think that releasing albums over three years apart is 
a sluggish pace for a band. But when it comes to Tool and their 
newest album, «’etfa2 every second of those three years is visible 
in the music, and there is no doubt that it was worth the wait.
Tool has matured and improved vastly since their previous 
release, 4eltoMSs2 a great album in its own right. hcM «’etfa 
is more than the darkness seen in the previous albums. It evokes 
an enormous range of feeling, from frenzied rage to melancholic 
introspection to awe at the sheer beauty of their music. Never
before has any album

What: Ænema 
Label.'Zoo Entertainment
grabbed me as this did. I 
thoughtof Httle elseduriiig 
; the day and listened to the 
album at least three times 
every evening.' n8’etfa9i 
power is almost too great; 
it often becomes hard to do anything else but listen and contem­
plate while the music plays.
This album is the first Tool has done with their new bassist, 
Justin Chancellor. He replaced Paul D’Amour, who left the band 
in September 1995. Chancellor was previously in the London- 
based band Peach. For the founding members, the best part 
about him is the little devi) horns in his hair.
With a new bassist, «’etfa is a broadening of their previous 
musical style, becoming more passionate and melodic. Don’t 
worry, guitarist Adam Jones hasn’t lost his raw edge; he just 
refined it to he create his uniquely brutal guitar melodies. Drum­
mer Danny Carey is also much improved (not that he sucked 
before) and is now amazing, perfectly addinghis complex rhythms 
to the songs. Even vocalist Maynard James Keenan has grown to 
become one of the most moving and powerful voices in the music 
industry.
zetfa is a hefty 77 minutes, crammed full of all the music possible. 
Many songs on this album break the eight-minute mark, but like the 
band says, their songs will be as long as they needtobeto work out all 
the ideas involved. In the age of short attention spans, it’s great to find 
a band that fully develops their songs, instead of making them three- 
minute verse-chorus-verse songs.
This album, besides containing great music, has several weirder 
selections, mostly as segues. The most amusing and disturbing is 
“Message to Harry Manback,” two minutes of a very angry and bitter 
Italian man ranting and threatening someone set to seagulls and an 
eerie piano tune. There is also a very strange pseudo-lounge tune that 
appears between songs, just keyboards. But it fits, as they later take 
that same lounge tune and make it one of the hardest tunes of the 
album.Tool is the thinking man’s metal, suitable for a mosh pit of 
private contemplation. With zetfa2 Tool has come upon brilliance, 
and I urge anyone who considers getting this album to buy it immedi­
ately. You won’t be disappointed.

Camp Stories evokes nostalgia
© 1996 Artistic License Rims
Susan Vanech and Zachary Taylor star in Herbert Beigel’s Camp Stories. The movie tells the tale of young 
boys and trials and tribulations while attending a Jewish summer camp.
By JESSICA RHODES
¦aoMae pcenSo UMavv
Ahhh, summer camp — teenage pranks, test- 
osterone-filled competition, Parent’s Day, raiding 
the girl’s camp. Wait... what’s that music in the 
background? It’s polka!
What: Camp Stories 
Director: Herbert Beigel 
Company: Artistic License Films
dramatically real world of feuding administrators, 
a sadistic counselor, and his attractive wife who 
feels neglected by him. There are more layers to 
this plot than lasagna.
The movie is framed within a legal context in 
which the two teenage antagonists are adult law­
yers struggling to reach agreement over a plea 
bargain in a murder case. I frankly didn’t see the 
point in the framing — it only took up maybe five 
minutes of film and the movie would be just as 
effective without it.
Beigel uses an interesting mix of actors. Young 
David is played by Zachary Taylor, best known 
for his lead role in the series I*66 B67 Ysa78 Old 
David is played by Elliot Gould. Schlomo, the 
-î5afw UMSonti is a David-and-Goliath, coming of head administrator of the camp, is played by — 
a£e movie set in the late ’50s at a faltering Jewish get this — Jerry Stiller who is none other than 
b)pys’ camp, Camp Ararat. Fifteen-year-old David George’s father on Utnevt6l8 Relatively new ac- 
E^atz would rather spend his summer in the movie tress Susan Vanech, who plays David’s girl- 
t^eater, but his parents are forcing him to go to the friend, does a less-then convincing job. Overall, 
P.pconos summer camp so that he can get closer to the movie has an interesting slant on the trials 
hjis religion. It’s his first summer at the camp and of adolescence.
hfe’s having a hard time being accepted — espe- I found this movie surprisingly humorous and
cjally by bully counselor Chaim and Camp Ararat poignant. And despite the crappy sound quality 
veteran Paul. David is falsely accused of every- of the director’s-cut video release, I began to
thing from throwing the campers’ special peanut 
biitter-and-jelly sandwiches in the lake to sleeping 
With Chaim’s wife — who is, by the way, actually 
sleeping with the sheriff of the neighboring town.
Herbert Beigel shows us many of the memorable, 
i^iiot humorous, aspects of summer camp. We see
wax nostalgic for those days of summer camp 
(Although, I have never attended a Jewish boys’ 
camp, I guess 4-H camp is rnel o/similar.) If you 
want to find out what happens with David dur­
ing his summer camp experience and if you want 
to flash back to those days of summer camp in
t§e spoiled brat who dai to have his candy, the nerd your adolescence, I would definitely recommend 
who plays the violin horribly a66 Mdt Mnft2 and the this movie. It’s not great, but it’s good enough to 
egotistical kid who thinks he is the leader of the see on video. Oh yeah, the sound track is a must- 
ojiher kids. We are thrown into the comic yet have if you’re into polka music!

Heinz Hall celebrates 
twenty-fifth anniversary
HEINZ, from page L9
tition vestibules were installed for any late­
comers to the performances.
Audiovisually, the building was improved with 
the installation of remote cameras and screens, 
nine feet by 24 feet, were installed to be used 
occasionally to showcase solos of performers and 
conductors. In the lobby, monitors, funded by 
Sony, have been installed to view performances 
outside the main Hall itself.
According to Catanzano, “The future says cus­
tomer service.” With the anniversary season, 
Heinz Hall has focused on improving its relation­
ship with its patrons. The concierge’s box has 
been expanded to offer more information to pa­
trons. The Box Office hours have been expanded 
from 8 am to 8 pm, seven days a week, to make 
ticket sales even easier for patrons. Also, espe­
cially for the anniversary season, a video maga­
zine, called the In-Hall Information Service, will 
be shown beginning this month. This video is a 
continuous loop video, shown twice in seven- 
minute segments during each performance, be­
fore the show and during intermission. The 
video magazine provides information on up­
coming events, customer service options, and 
other information, with the purpose of keeping 
Heinz Hall customers happy and fully informed. 
All of these new renovations have greatly en­
hanced Heinz Hall, and Catanzano says, “[Heinz 
Halil is considered to be one of the premiere 
concert halls in the world.”
This month, there are several performances, 
both orchestral and Pops performances. From 
October 10-12, Ca6ti voSf Mdt UbonwM2 an or­
chestral conducted by Robert Spano and nar­
rated by Patrick Stewart, will be shown, fea­
turing Prokafiev’s Peter arcd Mdt uS6v2 Opus 67, 
and compositions from Stravinsky and Britten. 
Also, Bell Atlantic Pittsburgh Pops offers 5Sft 
MS Mdt 5aOaotM2 featuring Joel Grey and Karen 
Akers with Marvin Hamlisch from October 17- 
20. Heinz Hall patrons can also look forward to 
the coming of the national Broadway produc­
tion of utiM Unlt UMSo7 from December 24 to 
December 29.
The interior of Heinz Hall is immaculate. Most of it has been modified over the last 25 years.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 7 October 1996
By DAVID ELMAN
CaoMae UMavvsonMto
Those familiar with Type 0 Negative either love them for their 
unique take on the metal sound, or hate them for their questionable 
lyric content and attempts to pose as something they’re not. While 
their new album, ©bMSOto ­ciM2 may not change many opinions, it 
does represent the continuing evolution of the group from its speed- 
metal debut, U6Ss2 »ttw ael $aol2 to a more gentle, slightly gothic- 
; influenced sound on h6SSl7 Kniiti8 Their newest release features an 
; increased use of keyboards, along with rumbling guitars and heavy 
; bass lines, for an overall feel that is somewhat depressing and 
; mournful.
Who: Type O Negative 
What: October Rust 
Label: Roadrunner Records
; “Love You to Death,” is a good choice for a first track as a good 
sample of what they have to offer. A piano opens the song accompa­
nied by Peter Steele’s deep bass voice, and a short while later the 
guitar kicks in, increasing the already strong low end. A keyboard 
melody is introduced near the end, and a steel guitar circles through 
the mix. The lyrics deal with love, as the title says, as do many of the 
following songs. Other concepts the band tackles are death and the 6‘ccult, but all of these are woven together into an odd blend on most 
tracks.
As a whole, the band does not stray far from their formula, but this 
is not to say that their sound is standard. Although the length of 
most cuts on this album are shorter than those on previous ones, 
most hover around seven minutes. The only clear radio cut is “My 
Girlfriend’s Girlfriend,” about an odd threesome. Despite its length, 
however, Type 0 Negative maintains its standard elements, such as 
Speed changes and lengthy instrumental bits. Throughout the 
record, Steele’s voice stays within a two-octave range below what 
most can handle and sometimes threatens to fall to subsonic levels.
The songs are characterized by a huge bass sound which often is 
overlaid with organs or keyboards, creating music that is heavy yet 
still rhythmic.
Notable tracks are “Be My Druidess,” where Steele’s voice is 
slightly higher and he sings of lust in pagan times, and “Green 
Man,” a song rife with images of nature that features slightly 
distorted vocals. “Red Water (Christmas Mourning)” is also 
strong with its odd story of death and Christmas.
The cuts most likely to appeal to those familiar with the band 
are “Die with Me,” which is similar in feel to the title track off 
their last album and deals with the pain of separation, as well as 
"Burnt Flowers Fallen,” a simple track in the vein of “Can’t Lose 
You.” “Cinnamon Girl” is a cover of a Neil Young song, but one 
would never know because it is completely incorporated into the 
standard Type 0 sound. Whatever instrumentation Young had 
written for the song has been replaced with manic organ and 
guttural guitar.
The only misstep on the album is “In Praise of Bacchus,” which 
maintains the same lyrical nature and adds a touch of light 
guitar. The track seems a bit flat and perhaps should have been 
replaced with one in their usual style.
As a whole, ©bMSOto ­ciM is a refreshing step away from the 
work of other bands and keeps tile quality of Type O Negative’s 
previous releases. Anyone looking for a unique sound is strongly 
advised to check out this album.

Pianist delivers an impressive repertoire
By ADAM KLIVANS
CaoMae UMavvsonMto
. This past Wednesday, the first 
concert of this year’s Y Music 
Society recital series took place 
in Carnegie Music Hall on Forbes jestic tone.
grand romantic spirit. 
With complete control of 
the intricate voices 
throughout all three 
pieces, Watts hadno dif­
ficulty sustaining a ma-
Avenue. Pianist Andre Watts took 
to the stage with an ambitious 
program consisting of works by
• Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, 
’ Chopin, Debussy, and Jandcek.
Discovered at the age of 16 by 
: Leonard Bernstein, Watts has es­
tablished himself as one of the
• foremost interpreters of the stan- 
; dard repertoire. His national tele-
. vision appearances and numer­
ous concert engagements have 
made him one of the world’s most
; sought-after pianists. Of course, 
even a musical dunce knows that 
¦this does not preclude the possi­
bility of a bad performance.
• Most conderts that I attend re­
quire a great deal of critical 
thought to determine an appro­
priate evaluation.
Only in the most suc- 
r cessful (or most disas- 
' trous) performance do 
'I’find the luxury of an 
•'“easy” review. While 
.listening to the stellar
- playing of Andre 
Watts, I realized that 
this was indeed one of 
those rare moments.
, Watt’s began with 
three Bach Chorales 
' transcribed for piano.
These chorales are 
quite different in char­
acter from most of 
Bach’s keyboard mu­
sic; many composers, 
most notably Ferrucio 
Busoni, have used the 
form to emphasize 
. (and often exaggerate)
, the lush harmonic tex­
tures in Bach’s music.
Watts’ passionate 
! playing evoked this
The concert continued 
with ?P (aonaMnSei Se 
ae ©ongnea6 Cdtft by 
Beethoven (WoO. 80).
Though not as interest­
ing as the great Diabelli 
variations, these pieces 
work quite well as an 
exciting improvisational 
romp in C minor. Although the 
technically challenging piece 
could topple the most proficient 
of pianists, Watt’s unparalleled 
mastery of the keys had no diffi­
culty navigating any of the varia­
tions. Even more amazing was 
his ability to vary color and dy­
namics while in the midst of this 
grueling escapade. It was per­
haps the most exciting moment

of the evening.
Watts continued with a stir­
ring, albeit somewhat terrifying, 
rendition of Schubert's uaeltoto 
BaeMai7 (D.760). Were I to pick 
one flaw in his performance this 
evening it would have to be his 
hyper romantic interpretation of 
this work. Although the uaeltoto 
BaeMai7 contains some ofthe most 
beautiful and moving passages 
in the entire piano 
repertoire, Watt’s 
playingleft me rather 
seasick. While excit­
ing, his performance 
captured more ofthe. 
spirit of Franz Liszt’s 
bombast than the 
staid romantic pres­
ence of Franz 
Schubert.
After intermis­
sion, Watts moved 
on to the repertoire 
that in many ways 
best suits his play­
ing style. His inter­
pretation of three 
’Mclti (Op. 10, No. 
9; Op. 25 No.7, No.
1) and the BaeMai7 
ne B fneSo (Op. 49) 
by Chopin contained 
an unparalleled 
level of intelligence 
and depth. Watts 
maintained a deli­
cate yet intense touch through­
out the works, displaying again 
his uncanny control of tone and 
dynamic range.
The most musically interest­
ing moment of the night took 
place during Janicek’s USeaMa 
]T8 ¦8 T[|#H %BoSf Mdt UMottMx8 
Filled with harmonic motives 
that are so characteristic of 
Janacek’s unique musical voice, 
this sonata contains a deep pa­
thos that contrasts with the 
other works on the program. 
Never soporific, Watt’s playing 
captured the frenzy of the first 
movement as well as the dark 
mood of the alagnS8
Watts ended with G9ni6t 
pS7tcit2 a short piano gem by 
Debussy. This colorful piece 
served as a great finale, demon­
strating Watt’s light touch and 
remarkable versatility. As an 
encore, he marched through a 
toccata by Scarlatti.
Full of energy and enthusi­
asm, Watts quite frequently 
grunted and groaned his way 
through pieces. Although his 
unabashedly romantic ap­
proach can at times be unset­
tling, his desire to push musi­
cal ideas to their limit keeps his 
playing fresh, inspired, and 
moving. Watts is a paragon of 
musical capability (and he 
hasn’t even won a Grammy — 
go figure).
New album lives up to esteemed reputation
New Sheryl Crow 
album disappoints
By BECKY A. COWSER
CaoMae ytsi ’lnMSo
Sheryl Crow’s got a new im­
age. She’s darker, moodier, 
more in touch with her Alanis 
Morrisette side—at least that’s 
what you’d think by looking at 
her new album cover.
Who: Sheryl Crow 
I What: Sheryl Crow 
Label: A&M Records 
Inc.
But I’ll let you in on a secret
— no matter how much black 
eyeliner Sheryl cakes on, no 
matter how much she pouts, 
this album doesn’t reveal her 
deeper side. In fact, the effort is 
not even close to that of CctiW
la7 yngdM zcinb 56cO, her de­
but album. No, it’s the same old 
Sheryl , with the same old songs, 
singing the same old way, only 
: in new packaging.
Cctila7 yngdM zcinb 56cO 
wasn’t the greatest album ever 
recorded, but it could stand its 
ground when grouped with the 
standard pop-rock fare. The 
problem I really had with it 
wasn’t Crow’s actualsong-writ- 
ing, save for that monstrosity 
of a.hit “All I Wanna Do," but 
her lyric-writing. The same 
problem exists on her sopho- 
morie effort, the self-titled 
“Sheryl Crow.” ¦
On this album, Crow takes 
one line and repeats it over and 
.over again, until you get so sick 
. of it you Want to slit your, wrists. 
In practically every song on 
Udto76 5oSs there is a one-line 
re&ainthat shejust keeps whin­
ing constantly. Have you ever 
had a really bad dream at night 
and throughout the next day 
kept remembering it in painful 
sharp pangs and wondered if it. 
Would ever stop? Listening to a
song on this album can be like 
that, With that one line popping 
up just often enough for you to 
wonder why the hell you’re sub­
jecting yourself to this torture.
Crowproducedthisalbumher- 
self, so maybe that explains so 
many ofthe inconsistencies. Nev­
ertheless, the album is a poor 
showing for Crow. Her vocals 
seem to have only gotten thin­
ner and more strained from her 
debut album, and the content 
and topics of her songs have 
astronomically dropped in qual­
ity (once again, if you discount 
the heart-sickening “All I Wanna 
Do”). Take, for example, the song 
“Oh, Marie.” The refrain con­
sists of the one line: “Oh Marie, 
I sure hope you’re happy. Oh 
Marie, what about me?” over 
and over about 50 times. The 
instrumentation is not that bad 
(notice that it is also riot that 
good), but the lyrics and music 
sound like they were written by 
a junior high school girl group 
called “Haiku Morning.” The 
harmony is so simple you can 
pick it up after one listening, 
even if you don’t know what the 
word harmony means.
And not that simple is bad. If 
there is a high point to this 
record, surely it is when Crow is 
at her simplest, stripped down 
to voice and guitar on a song like. 
“Home,” the album’s one cut that 
doesn’t make me physically ill.
After the mass popularity and 
appeal of Cctila7yngdM zcinb 
56cO2 maybe Crow should have 
stuck with her old producer.- 
With the burden of "writing,:: 
singing and producing, she is ; 
obviously hindering her music 
by taking on too much respon­
sibility. She shouldn't have 
tried to ran so far in the other 
direction because she didn’t 
even make it back to where she
began.

It was a simple story—a bunch 
of friends in a band, needed a new 
drummer, and they get Guy 
Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) to 
fill-the role.
I What: CdaM Cdneg £Sc 
»SI
Director: Tom Hanks 
Company: 20th Cen­
tury Fox
His upbeat, Beatlesesque ren­
dition of one of their songs 
launches the group to the top of 
the music charts. CdaM Cdneg £Sc 
»SR is their story, about what 
happens on the way to the top — 
and on the way down.
Guy works as a salesman at his 
dad’s appliance store in Erie, 
Penn, in 1964. A local band who 
lost their drummer due to an ac­
cident seeks out Guy, who is a 
natural with the drums. After 
playing in a college talent show, 
The Wonders. become an over­
night success. Soon they have a 
single of their hit, “That Thing 
You Do!” available on record. 
Play-Tone Records signs The 
Wonders to tour the country, and 
ends up getting them on televi­
sion and even in a motion picture. 
But not all good things last, and 
as the band finds out, the inter­
nal struggle between the band 
members begin to take its toll on 
the group and its success.
Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) is 
the band’s songwriter. His song 
“That Thing You Do!” was ini­
tially a ballad before Guy turned 
it into a rock ’n’ roll hit. Faye (Liv 
Tyler) is Jimmy’s girlfriend, who 
ends up being the “costume de­
signer” for the band’s summer
tour. Lenny (Steve Zahn) is the 
lead guitarist for The Wonders, 
whose romantic flings cause some 
unneeded pressures on the band. 
Mr. White (Tom Hanks) is the 
Play-Tone record executive who 
signs The Wonders to his label 
and gives them their key to fame.
The film had a relatively nice 
pace — it never got dull and if it 
was headed that way, it would 
change direction. Hanks, in his 
directorial debut, does a fine job 
directing the talentedyoung cast, 
who actually played and sang the 
songs in the film.
There’s drama mixed with 
slight comedy. This is not a funny 
film. It isn’t meant to be. But it 
does have an optimistic edge 
about it, even though things fall 
apart for the band.
“ThatThingYouDo!”is a catchy 
song. But to play it 17 times (or so 
it seemed) in one movie is a bit 
overdoing it. Sure they sing other 
songs, but they aren’t what pro­
pelled the band to stardom. The 
feeling of1964 is recreated impec­
cably in every scene. From the 
main street in Erie to the televi­
sion studios in Hollywood, every­
thing seemed authentic. They even 
have old footage of Pittsburgh from 
the 1960s for the scene when the 
band plays downtown.
An amusing aspect to the film 
wasthecameos. Jonathan Demme, 
who directed Hanks in Ndn6alt6W
wdna (and is. one of the film’s pro­
ducers) has a cameo as the beach- 
movie director. Rita Wilson, 
Hanks’ wife, has a small role as a 
waitress who introduces Guy to 
his idol, Del Paxton, at a local jazz 
club in Los Angeles. Peter Scolari 
is the movie star who introduces 
The Wonders in their television 
appearance. His involvement in 
the film was a reunion of sorts for 
Hanks—they were both the stars

New album marks change in artist
ByAMITKAR

Harry Connick Jr. is a little 
different nowadays. His music 
used to conjure up images of a 
beautiful couple, madly in love 
with each other, swaying cheek- 
to-cheek in the middle of a large 
dance hall, the lights casting a 
romantic glow on everything.
Who; Harry Connick

around reading each other’s 
minds all the time — it can be 
very confusing.
funk and swing. The lyrics are, as 
we say, true to the funk and lend 
the song some real attitude. 
“Little Farley,” a condemnation

His unofficial title of “Mr. Ro­
mance” was confirmed when he 
recorded the soundtrack for the 
original romantic comedy of the 
modem era, udte $aoo7 ztM 
Ua6672 starring Meg Ryan and 
Billy Crystal.
But Harry has changed. He’s 
trying different things. First, 
there’s acting—not only did “Mr. 
Romance” play a terrifying psy­
chopath in last year’s thriller 
5Sw7baM with Sigourney Weaver, 
but he was also the f-18 pilot in 
I»ì who panicked and got blown 
to smithereens. And now there’s 
his latest release, UMao CcoM6t 
(1996, Sony Music Entertain­
ment).
Somewhere between h6ct 
GngdM2 ­tl GngdM (1991) and Udt 
(1994), Connick dropped his sig­
nature big band sound for a funk- 
influenced acid jazz style that is

Harry Connick Jr.’s latest album, Star Turtle, offers a different sound from 
his previous work. This album mixes his traditional jazz with a new funk.
That’s not to say that it can’t be plays the same musical melange, 
entertaining though. If you ig- “Mind on the Matter” is the hard- 
nore the three title tracks, UMao est swinging out-and-out jazz 
CcoM6t is a delicious goulash of number on UMao CcoM6t and even 
Connick’s musical interests, manages to remind the listener
The rest of the tracks are a 
result of wider musical influences 
or interests. “Eyes of the Seeker” 
starts out as blue-grass and then, 
with the introduction of an over­
driven guitar hitting power 
chords, becomes almost a slow 
metal number. “Nobody Like 
You to Me” sounds like some­
thing the Doobie Brothers 
would have recorded — it’s 
funkdafied ’70s rock. “Hear<me 
in the Harmony” and “City Be­
neath the Sea” are sweet fusion 
numbers, and are, perhaps, lyri­
cally the closest thing to what 
we would normally expect from 
Harry Connick Jr.
Then there is the issue of the 
three title tracks, “Star Turtles” 
one through three. In UnMt2 
Connick introduced a song en­
titled “Follow the Music” which 
was essentially a monologue 
with some backing music. The 
words, (something about music 
saving the world), sounded like 
they were being uttered by<a 
large, angry reptile who smoked 
a lot. The title tracks on UMao 
CcoM6t follow in the same vein, 
only this time its harder to tell 
what Harry is going on about: 
“We’ll trace the crescent’s rim / 
Pawn’s pursuit of deliverance / 
My soul a satchel of musical 
vim / Then I’ll return to save my 
race.” Apparently, Mr. Connick 
still thinks his music will save 
the world. Its just that, lately, 
he’s been thinking jazz, not lotfe,

Taxi Driver
This movie is better than sitting in an adult 
theater with Cybil Shepherd. In fact, it’s way, way 
better. This movie is really cool. See, Jodie Foster is 
this prostitute and Harvey “Boom-Boom” Keitel is 
her pimp. So Big Bob De Niro is a taxi driver (a 
driver of taxis), who wants to get her out of the 
nasty life and into his wholesome presidential 
assassination plans.
Pretty heady stuff.
So anyway, there’s blood and guts and plenty of 
monkey lovin’. See it withSZ Perro del Falafel, who 
gets sick at the grotty parts.

There’s this car dealer guy who hires these two 
guys to kidnap his wife so her rich father will give 
him money to keep him out of financial trouble, but 
things go screwy and people start killing each

But this is a good one. It was done by the Coen

their quirky look at love and life.

This is that one movie with the fat guy who played 
Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire and 
Flo in the television series Mel’s Diner. So this one 
is famous out of general principle. Many, many 
people will definitely recommend it.
It’s really long, too, so if you have one of those 
travel games like Mini-Scrabble or Sorry!, then you 
better bring it. Also, bring a blanket. Maybe a 
change of shoes. Also, a compass, lighter, and a 
marker. Don’t forget water for El Perro del Falafel. 
Don’t forget to call home before going (there’s bad 
words). Remember the Alamo, Hertz, and the U-
