Carnegie Sorority, 
Gamma Phi Sigma, 
Going National
They were just a group of girls 
in the beginning, but since those 
first days they have gone far, for 
they are now among the leading so­
cial sororities on campus. Gamma 
Phi Sigma has always meant a 
chance to make friends and to en­
rich college life in all possible ways.
For several months they have 
been preparing to join the national 
fraternity, Delta Gamma, under the 
able leadership of Kay Laboon. Al­
though Kay was graduated in De­
cember her work has been very suc­
cessfully carried on by Dotty Vieh- 
man.
The Delta Gamma Fraternity, 
which was seventy years old Janu­
ary 2, is one of the oldest fraterni­
ties for women. The first, chapter 
was founded at Lewis School, Ox­
ford, Mississippi, and the roll call 
now includes 56 chapters. Beta Nu, 
the Carnegie Tech chapter, will be 
the 57th.
After two years of experimental 
work the fraternity project, “Aiding 
thè Blind,” was adopted at the 1930 
convention and has been carried on 
with increasing success and inter­
est since that date. Working for 
those less fortunate than themselves 
hàs brought their alumnae together 
and» has given added meaning to 
sorority ties.
The college sorority stands for 
good scholarship, for cooperation 
with the college administration, and 
for the maintenance of fine social 
ideals. There are many Delta Gam-

Tech A. S. T. P. Group 
Finishes Examinations
Last week the Tech ASTPer wore a 
more than usually slightly dazed ex­
pression that came as a result of the 
Army tests which are given men in 
the ASTP each quarter to deter­
mine how well they have mastered 
the subjects. The scores will be 
used to determine in part the final 
grade of the trainee in the subject 
and will be used as a recommenda­
tion for progression to the next 
term. The ASTP has three cycles 
and each cycle takes the same tests 
at the same time and is graded on 
the same basis. The ASTPer suf­
fers in the tests along with students 
from Amherst, Montana State, and 
North Carolina State. These schools 
are in the second cycle.
The only changes in the method 
of giving the tests this quarter is 
that now the exams take two days 
at the end of the eleventh week 
instead of several days at the be­
ginning of the eleventh week. This 
made the third time that the tests 
have been given to Tech students.
All the tests are scored here with­
in three days and the grades are 
given to the instructors to be used. 
The tests are then sent to the War 
Department for further checks, ma­
chine scoring, and analysis of re­
sults. t
Lonesome Soldier In New Guinea 
Welcomes Picture Of Tech Girls
Betty Grable may reign as Hol­
lywood’s chief “Pin-up Girl,” but 
when it comes to claiming Pitts­
burgh’s laurels two Tech “gals” 
lead the throng.
Several months ago Janet Arm­
strong and Billie Mcllrath had the 
above picture taken as a Carnegie 
Tech publicity release. Though they 
realized that it would reach many 
local residents, the girls never 
dreamed that it would eventually be 
received as a “bit of home news”
Pi Tau Sigma Holds 
Initiation and Election
Pi Tau Sigma, the national honor­
ary for Mechanical Engineers, held 
its latest initiation on December 12,
1943, admitting a total of six men, 
including four R. O. T. C. students, 
one civilian engineer, and one hon­
orary member, Professor McKee. 
The R. O. T. C. men were A1 Sul­
livan, ME ’44, Robert Tabor, ME ’44, 
James Langan, ME ’44, and William 
Gabig, MA ’4. The civilian engineer 
initiated was Michael Norton, ME 
’44. On January 16, the honorary 
held a banquet at Webster Hall Ho­
tel, at which Professor Trinks, for­
mer head of the Deprtment of Me­
chanical Engineering at Carnegie 
Tech, was the main speaker. Profes­
sor Trinks, who has gone into the 
field of manufacturing bombs and 
shells, gave a brief talk on his work.
At the last meeting of the honor­
ary, the officers for the current year 
were elected. They are: I. Burton 
Faigen, President; Howard Engel, 
Secretary-Treasurer; and William 
Leone, Corresponding Secretary. 
Burt Faigen, president of Pi Tau 
Sigma, has led a very active life 
on campus and his election to the 
presidency of Pi Tau Sigma cli­
maxes his activities. He was former 
consul of Tau Delta Phi. Howard 
Engel, the Secretary-Treasurer is 
the man who commands the civilian 
R. O. T. C. students.
by a Pittsburgh soldier stationed 
in New Guinea.
Just how welcome the picture 
of the two girls was to lonesome 
doughboys stationed so far from 
home was related by Private Wil­
lard Klein in V-Mail letters recent­
ly received by Janet and Billie. As 
he explained, “We fellows don’t see 
many nice things and it gets pretty 
monotonous, so when I saw two 
pretty girls’ pictures from my homer 
town I just had to write.”
Aero Engineer To Aid 
Tartan Publication Work
On Friday, January 21, Nicholas 
J. Georges, who has been a reporter 
on the Tartan staff since May of
1943, was appointed to the editorial 
board of this paper. He will fill 
ably the shoes of Aron Beck, who 
was called to the United States 
Army over the Christmas holidays. 
Nickie, as he is affectionately called 
by his many friends, is a Mechanic­
al Aeronautical Engineer in the bud, 
born with a joy stick in his mouth 
(he keeps telling us up in the Tartan 
office). A native Pittsburgher, Mr. 
Georges knows what he’s talking 
about when he crys, “I’m going to 
get out of this burg when I make 
my first million.” In the sports line, 
Nick likes tennis, push-ups, and do­
ing nothing. When asked about his 
dream woman, Nickie replied, 
“Georges makes no comments on 
the ideal woman,” but we know her 
name is Meta. The man also re­
fuses to designate any pet hates so 
we assume that Georges has no 
enemies.
Attention: Soldiers and Civilians:
All uniforms, instruments, mu­

A. C. A. C. Sponsors 
March of Dimes Dance
Following the basketball game 
this Friday, a dance sponsored by 
A. C. A. C., will be held in the Gym­
nasium. The basketball game be­
tween the Regimental team and a 
rival army team starts at 7:30.
Civilians and soldiers alike will 
be thrilled by the solid sending of 
the A. S. T. P. orchestra. P. F. C. 
Arnold J. Cardarelli of Brookline, 
Mass, has done a fine job in direct­
ing the talented group of soldiers. 
The students who have never heard 
their smooth renditions certainly 
have a great surprise in store for 
them. Free food by the Army is al­
so in the offering.
The dance is for stags, but if you 
can catch a date, bring her along. 
The price is only fifty cents. A good 
crowd is expected since it will be 
the evening before the Army starts 
its quarterly furlough. Tickets go 
on sale this week on the campus 
and in all companies.
The originator of this idea, Lt. 
Glenn L. Pickrel, designated that 
the entire proceeds are to go to the 
March of Dimes. As everyone 
knows, this worthy fun, which is cli­
maxed by the President’s birthday 
each year, goes to help all infantile 
paralysis victims.
So let’s all come out to help the 
March of Dimes!

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1944
AbmcUctin,The Outlook . . .
Last week saw the inauguration 
of the Fourth War Loan Drive. 
Once again, Americans are asked to 
dig deep to the tune of the “Stars 
and Stripes Forever.” Sitting placid­
ly behind our slide rules and lab 
desks we will ,no doubt, yawn tol­
erantly and say, “how boring.” The 
slogan, “Back the Attack with 
Bonds,” has become almost as trite 
as “L S-M F T,” so we shan’t at­
tempt to appeal to you on that 
score.
Periodically the student body has 
been faced with a bit of flag wav­
ing and asked to sacrifice its Wed­
nesday night movie, but to no avail. 
Student participation in the previ­
ous bond drives has been all but nil. 
Even the plea to give in dollar bills 
what the fighting men are giving in 
blood has failed to stir the more 
manly instincts among the so-called 
“intelligentsia.” It’s enough to 
make us lose completely our faith in 
education, a faith which at this 
point is tottering on the brink. But 
enough of emotion, let us approach 
the idea from a purely practical an­
gle.
Disregard the idea that we are be­
ing asked to sacrifice so that this war 
may end one day sooner. That fact 
is one which, we trust, you have 
come to appreciate by this time. If 
not, all our efforts in that direction 
would be merely wasted copy pa­
per. True, the duration has called 
on men to make many sacrifices, 
among them their steaks, their tires, 
and incidentally, their lives. But fi­
nancial support of the war cannot 
be called a sacrifice. It is a duty 
which every student owes to him­
self, a duty similar to voting and 
having similar repercussions. The 
government which you, by your in­
difference, fail to keep from power 
will rest on your shoulders, and the 
war which you, by your negligence, 
fail to win will rest on your head.
Many of you are working your 
way through Carnegie because you 
consider an education a good in­
vestment in your future. We con­
sider the purchase of war bonds just 
as vital an investment, aside from 
the fact that such purchases yield a 
33 1/3 per cent dividend. You 
aren’t being asked to abstain from 
your five o’clock coke in the canteen 
or be conspicuous by your absence 
at the campus dances. You are sim­
ply being given the opportunity to 
invest further in your own future. 
Don’t pass it up. We personally in­
tend to hock our most treasured 
charm bracelet and deposit our nest 
egg in a sounder institution, a 
twenty-five dollar boost to victory.
That’s The Way It Must Be
Many of the AST men who are 
obliging enough to run a critical 
eye over these words do not have a 
great deal of spare time. What a 
statement! Could the facts have 
been toned down any farther? 
Haven’t the soldiers recently com­
pleted two furious days of G. I. 
Achievements and staggered from 
slide rules of foreign phraseology 
with relieved sighs, only to find 
themselves in the midst of regular 
term’s and brain-splitters? Aren’t 
they faced with those other inci­
dentals of daily existence at the 
same time, such as eating, sleeping, 
procuring needed hair-cuts, caring 
for the laundry question, rotating 
as C. Q., etc., etc., etc., Under such 
conditions their social lives, leisure 
moments, and the time usually 
spent in the relaxing type of mental 
improvement have suffered almost 
100% casualties.
The boys in khaki have gone 
along with this system, because, 1) 
we have had little choice, 2) we 
have realized that it must be neces­
sary or it would have no place in 
the army. AST men, however, are 
human, and, above all, Americans 
—Americans fond of liberty, hard 
work, life in general, no regimenta­
tion, and their own share of fun. 
There seems to be little opportunity 
for such luxuries, doesn’t there? All 
right — there’s no time; and that 
isn’t good.
Now, let’s think a moment (even 
editorials require thought these 
days). Isn’t that precisely the pur­
pose of the ASTP? Are men soldiers 
or playboys? Is the learning of hard, 
vital, far-reaching knowledge which 
is intended towards the winning of 
the greatest war and the greatest 
peace of all history something to be 
used as a means of recreation? Of 
course, a great mass of work is 
handed out. Of course, examinations 
are frequent and brain-wearying. Of 
course time is at a premium. Of 
course every man wearing the 
sword-and-lamp is under constant 
unyielding pressure. Of course he 
always has more than he can com­
fortably handle. But that’s the idea!
The program intentionally applies 
this pressure. That is its method of 
determining who is fit to be given a 
responsible, truly important task in 
his next assignment, who is to be 
given a regular sheltered type of 
duty, and who is to be definitely 
eliminated from any such position 
of confidence and leadership. A sol­
dier is meant to have more to do
For two years now newspapers 
have been filled with stories of our 
boys in battle, with reports of de­
feats and victories—filled also with 
the terrible costs of such struggles. 
Lately we have read about Tarawa 
and Arawe, and we were proud to 
be compatriots of these heroes who 
landed on those beaches facing al­
most certain death. These men, 
and the troops in Italy and Eng­
land, in the East and here at home, 
are willing to fight and die for us—• 
yet some people refuse to grant 
them the right to vote, the most 
democratic of all the rights they are 
fighting for. For a long time it seem­
ed as if certain men, led by Sena­
tor Rankin, would really prevent 
our soldiers from casting their bal­
lots in the coming elections, and 
although public pressure has forced 
many of them to reverse their stand, 
the issue is still far from decided.
At this moment two bills, or rath­
er one bill and an amendment to an 
already defeated law, are on the 
floor of Congress. There is first, John 
Rankin’s law which tries to prevent 
the soldier vote by leaving its ad­
ministration to the separate states. 
This, of course, is tantamount to 
the prevention of the soldiers’ fran­
chise, for elections both in this and 
the last war have shown the im­
possibility of having 48 ballot from 
48 different states distributed on all 
the fronts. The backers of this bill 
are perfectly aware of this, yet they 
refuse to abandon their stand, and 
continue to hide their real inten­
tions behind the sham front of 
“states’ rights.”
than he can comfortably dispose of 
at his convenience. He must be 
able to lift a bit more than his share 
of the load, draw a little extra on 
the line, throw a few additional 
pounds onto the pulley, and contrib­
ute a few sleepless, danceless, and 
sober nights to a mass of work 
which will not wait. Those are some 
of the duties for which he is being 
incidentally trained. In plain words: 
Can he take it?
Something of great consequence 
may well hinge at some future date 
on the answer to that question.
It isn’t pleasant, but
Can you take it?
Letter to Editor
In answer to the Letter of last week, I 
wish to say that perhaps the ASTP should 
know a bit more about the makeup of the 
average Tech girl than he does.
She is not, as he seems to think, a 
pseudo-sophisticate, nor does she try to 
be unduly glamorous. She came to Car­
negie because, in many cases, she could 
not afford the luxury of a liberal arts 
college. In her studies, she is seeking to 
learn things which will make her able to 
take a real, deadly serious part in the 
adult post-war world.
In judging her gay appearance, please 
remember, Mr. Army, that she is very 
young, and just a little afraid of you. 
She really wants to be nice to you be­
cause she has a brother or a sweetheart 
in khaki somewhere far away in this war, 
but her natural shyness makes her a lit­
tle awkward and perhaps seemingly stiff 
in her approach. Then, too, she can’t un­
derstand that you refuse to feel that Tech 
is your school as much as hers, that it is 
your Carnegie. Won’t you make it really 
belong to all of us? Won’t you try to 
forget all the mistakes made on both 
sides, and accept Tech into your hearts as 
we want to accept you?
CLARA HERRON.
The other proposal -up for dis­
cussion is a compromising amend­
ment to the Lucas-Green bill, which 
would have given the Federal Gov­
ernment the power to hold elec­
tions among the troops. The new 
version provides for uniform bal­
lots, distributed by the Federal 
authorities, but given to the sepa­
rate states for the count of the votes. 
Although this amendment will 
cause much unnecessary adminis­
trative work, it is the only fair so­
lution left, for its passing would 
make sure that each and every sol­
dier, wherever he may be, would 
receive a ballot in time for the com­
ing Presidential elections. If this 
measure is passed, every man in the 
armed forces will be able to express 
his opinion as to who should govern 
the country he has served.
In addition to the basic problem 
an additional controversy has been 
thrown up by a seemingly unim­
portant clause in parliamentary 
procedure. New bills are voted 
upon by roll call, while amend­
ments to existing or defeated ones 
are not entitled to this. As the sit­
uation now stands, anyone voting 
against the Rankin bill, but for the 
Lucas-Green amendment could not 
prove that he was in favor of the 
soldier vote, while anyone doing the 
opposite cannot be accused of being 
against it. A fight is now being wag­
ed to have a roll call for the vote on 
the amended bill, and a negative 
outcome might well endanger the 
passing of this proposal.

Arctic Lass Now In
Roaring Metropolis
A far northern girl who welcom­
ed Uncle Sam’s khaki clad soldiers 
the only familiar sight in Amer-
i, is Inga Arsaels, Icelandic stu- 
jnt enrolled in a special English 
)urse at Margaret Morrison. Hav- 
lg arrived in New York by convoy 
ieveral months ago, Inga is still be­
wildered by “such a speed on 
everything, in moving, talking, and 
oh, yes—jitterbugging.”
Inga feels well qualified to speak 
of the last item after having tried it 
with hundreds of American boys 
stationed in Iceland. As she ex­
plained, “They gave us such a very 
good impression that everyone was 
dying to come to the States.”
Having heard of Carnegie Tech 
through a Pittsburgh Coast Artil­
leryman stationed in her native 
land, this attractive blonde lass de­
cided to further her studies here, for 
she intends to teach English upon 
her return to Iceland. Besides tak­
ing four required subjects for her 
future vocation Inga is also study­
ing Costume Economics.
Though Inga has had little dif­
ficulty in mastering English and 
speaks now with scarcely any ac­
cent, she reveals that she’s antici­
pating “trouble” when she will at­
tempt to translate it into Icelandic 
upon her return home.
"Despite the fact that Inga now 
considers herself a real Pittsburgh­
er after having acquired her “black 
lungs” in the recent smogs, she still 
yearns for the wide open spaces of 
the far north, and wistfully day­
dreams of a “snow capped mountain 
where I can enjoy my favorite 
sport, skiing.”

Prof. Harold Thomas 
Given Hilgard Award
At the 91st Annual Meeting of the 
American Society of Civil Engi­
neers, held January 19-21, Mr. Har­
old A. Thomas, professor of civil en­
gineering at Carnegie, and Mr. Emil 
P. Schuleen, in charge of U. S. En­
gineer flood control works for the 
Pittsburgh area, were awarded the 
Karl Emil Hilgard Award for their 
paper, “Cavitation in Outlet Con­
duits of High Dams.” This award is 
given biennially by the Hydraulics 
Division of the American Society of 
Civil Engineers for the best work on 
hydraulics printed in the Society’s 
publication, Transaction. Endow­
ed and named for an emminent 
Swiss engineer, the award com­
memorates the great respect and af­
fection with which Mr. Hilgard is 
held in this country.
Prof. Thomas was graduated from 
Columbia University with an A. B. 
degree in 1906 and later a Civil En­
gineering degree in 1908. After 
serving for a time as instructor at 
the University of Washington, he 
became successively associate pro­
fessor and professor of civil engi­
neering (1911-1923) at Rose Poly­
technic Institute. Coming to Car­
negie in 1923, Prof. Thomas now 
is professor of Civil Engineering 
and acting head of the Depart­
ment of Mechanics.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
The Sun Never Sets On the 
Trail Of His Globe Trotting
TUESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1Ô44
Introducing Pfc. Clifford Russell 
Edwards, well-built, mild-manner­
ed, continental accented, chestnut- 
moustached, mundane - mannered, 
keen-witted. “Cliff,” as he shall be 
known henceforth, is now a con­
spicuous entity of the minute Car­
negie French Area and Language 
section.
Let us learn something of this in­
teresting chap:
Cliff, after following an educa­
tion which took him from Canada, 
where he first saw the light—not 
only of the day — to the United 
States, England, Bermuda, and Nas­
sau, decided that destiny had de­
clared him to be a globe-trotter. Ac­
cordingly, at an early age, he decid­
ed to become a musician (Local 802, 
N. Y.). Thereby he saw a good deal 
of American cities, and of the Unit­
ed States in general while alternate­
ly thumping a set of protesting 
drums, and biasing scorching notes 
through a trumpet, in such bands as 
those of Louis Prima and the late 
Bunny Berigan. While filling an 
engagement at a lodge known as 
Rustic Cabins, up New Jersey way 
back in 1937, he met a lean young 
singer whose passion was to become 
a boxer. Cliff states that he possess­
ed a fair voice and a touchy disposi­
tion.
“Hardly an evening would pass 
without a sudden altercation break­
ing forth out on the floor. A crowd 
would gather, and, rushing to re­
store the order, we would discover 
this thin young chap valiantly fac­
ing an individual much older and 
weightier than he, who had aroused 
him by some incautious personal re­
mark.”
When asked if he remembered the 
name of this gamecock, Cliff recall­
ed that he had been a crooner, sec­
ondly, that the fairer sex had always 
found him appealing, and at last his 
name — Sinatra, or something like 
that.
The roving fever is strong in 
Cliff’s blood. Every summer he 
would join some ship’s orchestra 
with the purpose of feeling ever 
farther distant shores beneath his 
feet. In this manner he made two 
South American, two Mediterran­
ean, and some North Cape cruises, 
and in general, “shuttled about the 
Carribean until he seemed a na­
tive.”
Eventually, while filling an or­
chestra engagement in England, in 
1939, he was caught by the war. 
While playing there he had become 
acquainted with, and fascinated by 
the almost legendary tale of Regi­
nald Joseph Mitchell and the Spit­
fire. (See the picture'of the same 
name). Eager to pilot one of these, 
soon to prove heroes of the Battle of 
Britain, and one of democracy’s 
most potent weapons, he at once of­
fered himself to the R. A. F., only 
to be rejected because of astigma­
tism, and told he was suited only 
for the ground crew. He determin­
ed, however, that Edwards and Spit­
fire should meet. Pursuing this pol­
icy, he secured a job with Vickers- 
Supermarine, the makers. While as­
sembling his sleek friends, he dis­
covered a hitherto little known me­
chanical talent which was later to 
prove valuable.
Meantime the War of Attrition
had opened. In France Maginot and 
Siegfried still scowled into each 
other’s gun slits, and the first Luft­
waffe bombs had already cascaded 
on London, a warning of what was 
to come. The phenomenal British 
phledgon was making itself evident. 
One morning Cliff arrived at the 
Vickers plant just in time to over­
hear the following bit of dialogue 
between two friends at ease near 
the time clock:
“Did you hear that noise last 
night?”
“Yes, but I cannot say it disturbed 
me a great deal.”
What is peculiar? Each of these 
men lived at an end of a certain 
block. The preceding night the en­
tire center of that block had been 
blasted away by three direct hits 
from the bombs of a lone raider.
Early in 1940 Cliff and six of his 
fellow-assemblymen were sent to 
Canada to aid in building Vickers- 
Supermarine “Strandraer” flying 
boats at the giant Montreal Vickers 
factory.
“A few days out were sufficient to 
convince us that a combination of 
the small, indifferently constructed 
vessel, an eternally rough sea, and 
an never ending zigzag course 
which formed our only defense 
against submarines had a potent 
strength of its own in the matter 
of removing our sea legs.” (They 
were sea sick.)
At Canadian Vickers Cliff was 
put in charge of a predominantly 
French-Canadian crew. He there 
learned the rudiments of the lan­
guage which later so interested the 
ASTP. Even in Canada, however, 
it was impossible to remain in one 
place for long, and the wanderer’s 
feet soon took him to the R. A. F. 
Ferry Command, where he proceed­
ed to become a flight engineer.
The lure of the small deadly pur­
suit ships was soon to prove too 
strong. Consequently, restless feet 
4ed next to where a worthy cousin 
of the beloved Spitfire was being 
constructed, to Buffalo, N. Y., where 
the cannon-nosed Bell-Airacobra 
rolled down the runways.
While at Bell, Pearl Harbor, Wake, 
the Philippines had scorched their 
way across headlines and American 
hearts. Cliff determined to offer 
his skill in aviation mechanics to 
the Army Air Force in exchange for 
a uniform. In return he “was 
promptly relegated to the Limbo of 
Clerkship.” This was upsetting in 
the least, but that clerkship was to 
carry him to magnificent Carlsbad 
Field, New Mexico, “the Army’s 
paradise, where you drink in the 
breath taking beauty of the desert 
sunset, and are a mere unhampered 
stroll from Mexico, where wine, 
liquor, champagne, and absinthe 
frappes go at such outrageous prices 
as 25 cents per drink at the higher 
priced cantinas”
And it was there that Cliff was 
rudely awakened from that inter­
lude of interludes by—the ASTP.
Cliff Edwards has seen much of 
the English speaking world, wher­
ever it is found. The British com­
monwealth is dear to him, second 
only to the United States, between 
which two mighty powers he feels 
there should be only sympathy, un­
derstanding, and cooperation.
Systems, Systems, 
All Guaranteetl To 
Produce — What?
To the layman the Army tests 
are more or less a foreign subject, 
and the only place where the same 
type of test is given is in high school 
where you have the sheet to fill in 
the little boxes with black pencil 
if you know the right answer.
There are several different meth­
ods of approach to these tests, and 
we shall consider several of those. 
Bob has been doing very well in 
mechanics all quarter, and he feels 
that this is just another day in his 
life. Just to make sure that noth­
ing goes wrong he whips over a few 
formulae the night before and 
makes an impression of them on his 
mind. (Some people would not 
consider the mind the best place to 
have notes, much preferring that 
they be readily available on small 
bits of paper, but that is frowned on 
in the best of regulated tests). 
When test time arrives Bob is as 
cool as the proverbial cucumber, 
and he is ready to go. Bob will fin­
ish the test about five minutes early 
and get ready to rush for the door 
when it’s all over. On the way to 
the barracks he will ask Ed whether 
or not the thirty-second one should 
have been three and * a quarter of 
six and a third.
Ed has developed a science for 
taking tests of this type. In order 
to understand his method let’s look
at a purely hypothetical question 
from, say a mechanics test: 36. A 
car hits a lamp-post on the corner 
of Maple and Elm Street, at mid­
night on June the fourth. If the co­
efficient of friction is two times the 
angular acceleration of the wheels 
divided by the specific gravity of 
the water in the radiator, and ir 
there is only a pint in the tank 
what is the piston displacement * 
the engine?
a. 7.923467832900856 cu. inches.
b. 7.923467832900857 cu. inches.
c. One pint Southern Comfort oi 
two Seagrams.
d. Too much—information given.
To use Ed’s system, the answer is
irrelevant. Ed quickly reads the 
problem and reasons as follows: 
The first answer won’t be correct 
because it is the first answer and 
the first is never right. The last 
won’t be correct because the an­
swer to “35,” was “d” and they 
never put two in a row. It must be 
either “c” or “b.” Re-reading the 
question these words stand out: car 
and coefficient. Clearly the answer 
is “c.” Which obviously it wasn’t, 
since I got a nice long letter from 
Ed today. He is doing KP “some­
where in Texas” now.

Many people have, of late, 
brought to our attention the inade­
quacy of some of the referees of the 
Company Basketball League. When 
we heard the first complaint, we 
thought that the complaint might be 
an alibi because the losing team had 
made it. But then, we heard these 
complaints repeated again and 
again. More and more fellows af­
firmed the fact that a game soon 
gets out of hand with only one 
referee. One fellow decides to try 
something because he thinks the 
referee can’t possibly see him. If 
the foul goes unnoticed, the man 
who was fouled decides to get re­
venge. This is the best formula we 
know of for the transformation of 
a basketball game into a combina­
tion street-brawl and football game.
The league was started to give 
fellows who wanted to play basket­
ball a chance to do so. It was not 
started to foster hot headedness, 
hate, or any such unsportsmanlike 
quality. Signs of these qualities are 
rearing their ugly heads more and 
more frequently. The other day, a 
“man” on “one” team got angry 
about the constant fouling and 
struck another man much smaller 
than himself. No doubt, he shouldn’t 
have done this; but, the fact remains 
that the referee situation was at 
the bottom of it all.
Most of the fellows who officiate 
at the games work hard, but how 
can one man fill the shoes of two, 
regardless of how hard he tries?
We suggest that something be 
done to remedy the situation that is 
turning each basketball game into 
a riot. Two referees per game in­
stead of one would mean the differ­
ence between the display of hard, 
clean team rivalry and unsports­
manship of the “you-hit-me-I-hit- 
you” variety.

Captain Jack Sherman Leads 
Cagers In Uphill Floor Battles
Carnegie’s basketball teams have 
always been courageous squads led 
by fighting captains. This year’s 
aggregation by its plucky uphill 
battles has lived up to that tradi­
tion and it’s captain, Jack Sherman, 
has proved himself worthy to rank 
with such former Tartan leaders as 
“Hoot” Gibson, Bob Stark, and Dave. 
Brinn. Jack took over the captaincy 
after Hugh Smith graduated last 
month, and last week, in his second 
game as captain, he displayed his 
leadership and basketball skill by 
sparking the Skibos in their heroic 
stand against Penn State. In that 
game he was all over the court, 
breaking up State passes, setting up 
plays, and snagging rebounds right 
from under the noses of much taller 
opponents.
Sherman is in every sense a lead­
er. In addition to his spirit and 
ability which he shows on the de­
fense, he is the team’s “quarter­
back,” calling and directing plays 
on the attack much as does the 
quarterback in football. Besides all 
this, he is a constant threat because 
of his accuracy in tossing in long 
set shots.
Jack lives in Pittsburgh, and play­
ed high-school basketball at Cen­
tral Catholic High. He is now a 
junior in the Mechanical Engineer­
ing department, but last winter he 
was only a freshman when he play­
ed varsity ball. This year he is one 
of only two returning lettermen. 
When not playing basketball, Jack 
divides his time among studies, the 
Phi Kappa fraternity, and jitterbug 
sessions.
Co. B Wins From Co. E; 
E Loses First Place
Company B, in their second thrill­
er in less than a week, edged out the 
league-leading Company E team by 
a score of 22-20. The first quarter 
found both teams using a passing 
attack against each other’s stone­
wall defense. Repeated attempts to 
work through brought two points to 
each team. These two points apiece, 
coupled with the free throws scored 
by Rees, brought the score at the 
end of the first quarter to 6-2, with 
the B Co. out in front.
The fourth quarter turned into a 
riot of scoring with Heisey of Com­
pany B sinking 4 field goals to cap-
Skibos Lose Eighth 
As W & J Triumphs
Last Saturday night the Tech bas­
ketball team dropped their eighth 
consecutive game when they fell 
before a bigger and more experienc­
ed Washington and Jefferson squad, 
59-27, on the victor’s home court. 
The Skibos, playing without their 
captain, Jack Sherman, who was 
side-lined by a sprained ankle, never 
were in the game. The Presidents 
were sparked by their skyscraper 
center, Dickson, and Paul Konyha, 
star of last year’s team which fared 
so well in a post-season New York 
tournament.
W. & J. rang up six points before 
DufTet dropped in a foul shot for the 
visitors to make the score read, 6-1. 
The Prexies really got hot then and 
kept the cords swishing as they 
scored 16 points in a row to run the 
count to 22-1 before Duffet bagged 
a fielder with four minutes of the 
first half remaining. The score 
stood 23-5 at the intermission.
Both teams found the range in the 
third quarter as Tech scored 13 
points while W & J rang up 22. 
Coach Adam Sanders sent in his re­
serves to play the final period and 
Tech proceeded to throw a scare 
into the home team as they scored 9 
points before Sanders returned his 
regulars to action. The Prexies soon 
took control of the situation, coast­
ing in on the long end of the 59-27 
count.
For the victors, Sterling was high 
man with 11 points, followed by 
Kanyha with 10. Duffet paced the 
Tartans with seven markers.
ture the high point honors for the 
game. After being held to a single 
free throw in the third quarter, Co. 
E cut loose with Witt and Bianchet- 
ta sinking two field goals apiece. In 
spite of the repeated whirlwind at­
tacks, Co. B managed to hold the 
lead and finished the game on top 
of a 22-20 score.

But seriously, to both Bills we wish 
you lots of luck and success in any­

Here’s an odd one for you! And 
you can take my word for it that 
this is no fish story. Did you know 
that there are more fish than mer­

more gtiys than gals in the above- 
mentioned class). Hmm! Think I 
ought to begin bettering my use of

think so? (Never mind answering 
that!) . . . All P & D’s better be on

A. M. Cox, a graduate of the Even­

ment of steels, is now applying 
treatments such as nitriding, chap- 
manizing, carburizine, induction 
hardening, normalizing, annealing, 
stress relieving and age annealing.
Mr. Cox was quite prominent in 
the school activities while at Tech. 
He was one of the organizators of 
the Evening School Student Coun­

of the Phi Nu Fraternity, of which 
he was a past Director. He received

Post Holitlay Dance 
Enjoyed By Many
Talk about a good time! At last 
Saturday’s Post Holiday Dance the 
Evening School males and the 
ASTP’s really gave the girls the 
old “one two” leading them through 
all those difficult jitterbug steps and 
twirling them round and round 
when the orchestra played the pol­
ka.
And the orchestra — the music 
those soldiers played was really 
“out of this world.” Their style was 
most unusual and one could have 
listened to those trumpets and sax­
ophones all night; but then all Cin- 
derellas had to leave at midnight. 
And the smooth playing of Bill, the 
piano player, really reached every 
dancer’s heart.
which he is carrying on at his plant. 
His two sons are in the Navy. Orie, 
Elmer J. Cox, is a Machinists Mate, 
2/c, on a ship somewhere in the pa­
cific; the other, G. Robert Cox, is a 
Musician, 3/'c, at the Great Lakes 
Training School. L. Marjorie, the 
only daughter is in junior high 
school.
Bowling is one of Mr. Cox’s fav­
orite pastimes, and he likes to play 
a game of golf when he gets the op­
portunity. Of course, like everyone 
else, he enjoys a nice juicy steak, 
when and if he has those necessary 
points.
Mr. Cox says that the credit for 
his success is not entirely his. It is 
due to his wife, Mrs. Helen B. Cox, 
who was the necessary inspiration 
in his work. We are quitè sure that 
Mrs. Cox is proud of all he has ac­
complished.
By-product Gas Recovery 
Methods and Difficulties
Playing a very important part in 
the nation’s war efforts today, and 
representing the foundation upon 
which many of our steel industries 
depend, are the artificial gases man­
ufactured from coal. Of the various 
types produced, coke oven gas more 
nearly approaches the efficiency of 
natural gas than any other and has 
a calorific value of approximately 
560 Btu. cu. ft., which is roughly one- 
half that of natural gas. To permit 
the use of this gas as a fuel, it must 
undergo differènt treatments to sep­
arate the various by-products con­
tained in the raw coke oven gas.
The gases leaving thé coke oven 
are at a temperature of about 400° C 
and are conducted through a large 
main to coolers.
After the gas leaves the coolers, 
it enters a number of exhausters

which forces the gas through the 
various apparatus required to re­
move the by-products in the gas. 
The first of these is the tar extrac­
tors, where by means of impinge­
ment, tar is removed from the gas. 
The gas is now preheated by steam 
coils and put through acid satura- 
tors. Preheating is necessary to ac­
celerate the reaction and to prevent 
accumulation of water in the satura- 
tors. Ammonia sulphate is formed 
in xhe saturators in the rection. 
From here the gas is put through 
acid separators and then the final 
coolers. Cooling is now necessary 
to facilitate the recovery of benzol 
products. The gas then passes 
through a series of towers called 
“scrubbers.”
