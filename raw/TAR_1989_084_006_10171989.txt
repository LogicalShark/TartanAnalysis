Project forced back to design stage; design simplified, scaled down to meet budget
By BANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Financial snags have delayed the con­
struction of Carnegie Mellon’s portion of 
the Pittsburgh Technology Center. Al­
though construction was originally slated 
for last fall, the project is still in the devel­
opment stages. Carnegie Mellon was forced 
to scale down the plans for its building 
somewhat as preliminary architectural 
plans exceeded available funds.
The Pittsburgh Technology Center is a 
proposed research facility to be occupied 
by the University of Pittsburgh and Carne­
gie Mellon. Each university received money 
from the state to develop its portions ofthe 
center, which is seen as part of the area’s 
economic revitalization.
The complex is to be built on the site of a 
former Jones & Laughlin Steel Corpora­
tion mill located on the northern bank of 
the Monongahela River, along Second Ave­
nue.
According to Sandra J. Hemmingway, 
director of real estate development, the 
University originally planned to supply an 
additional $3 to $3.5 million in funding 
beyond the $17 million allotted by the 
state. “There were funds written into the 
operating budget as investments by the
University,” said Hemmingway, “but it 
was determined that perhaps that was not 
the best solution.”
“The original plans for the building would 
have resulted in it going over 17 million, so 
there has been some adjustment,” said 
Maggie McCormick, director of govern­
ment relations. “But that’s — as I under­
stand it — fairly normal.”
The basic steps in planning the project 
were schematic formulation, design devel­
opment drawings, and actual construction 
drawings. According to Dr. William M. 
Kaufman, director of Mellon Institute and 
vice president for applied research, it was 
not until the proj ect was on the verge of the 
third stage that the decision to temper 
costs necessitated a fundamental restruc­
turing ofthe design. According to Kaufman, 
CMU was forced to go “back to the drawing 
board.”
Hemmingway stressed that it was not 
through any fault ofthe architectural firm, 
Eisenman Architects, that plans exceeded 
funds, but rather that the situation is the 
result of alterations made by CMU in the 
midst of the process. “We made budgeting 
changes while we were in design,” said 
Hemmingway.
According to Kaufman, cost reductions 
were accomplished in three general ways.

Though work has started on the access roads for the Pittsburgh Technology Center, 
construction of CMU’s portion ofthe Second Avenue complex has been delayed because 
of funding snags.
First, the basic structure of the building 
was simplified, to eliminate excess archi­
tectural expenditures. Next, several 
planned atrium spaces were eliminated al­
together. As Kaufman said, “they’re a nice 
design element, but we can’t afford them.” 
Finally, the exterior surface ofthe building 
was restyled, with “in and out” grooves
along the surface being “smoothed” to re­
duce the total surface area. The project is 
now in the development drawing stage, 
once again.
According to McCormick, some of the 
delay is also due to the change in city 
government while the project was in its

An unknown individual splashed white paint on the Fence last 
Tuesday evening. The fence had been painted by members of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Gay and Lesbian Alliance to announce Na­
tional Coming Out Day.
In addition to the Fence incident, approximately one third of 
the copies of last week’s Student Union, which featured many 
articles related to National Coming Out Day, were stolen. Sev­
eral ofthe posters advertising GALA’s recent dance were ripped 
down.
Sergeant William Ricci of Campus Police said that no report of 
vandalism had been filed. According to Ricci, one person stopped

Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate 
School of Industrial Administra­
tion will establish an entrepre­
neurship center as a result of a $1 
million gift from Pittsburgh busir 
nessman Donald H. Jones. The 
center will be located in the new 
GSIA addition that the college 
will begin constructing in the 
spring.
John R. Thome, the David T. 
and Lindsay J. Morganthaler 
professor of entrepreneurship at
GSIA, will head the center. Thome 
began teaching a class in entrepre­
neurship at Carnegie Mellon in 
1972. Since then, the program 
has expanded to six courses. 
“Thanks to Don Jones’ large gift, 
we are now on a higher plateau.” 
said Thome.
In addressing the plans for the 
money, Thome said that “approxi­
mately half will go into designing 
and building some special facili­
ties in the new expansion of the 
GSIA building so we’ll have a 
physical location for the offices of 
the professors involved [in the
program], conference rooms, stu­
dent work areas, a small research 
library.... Until that is built, for 
the next two or three years, we’ll 
crowd into GSIA, but at least we’ll 
have the center operating.” 
Thome described the possible 
changes in curriculum for the 
entrepreneurial program. “We 
haven’t made all the detailed 
plans yet, as this [gift] was just 
announced, but we plan to offer 
courses university-wide, expand­
ing into the other areas outside of 
GSIA.... We pian to do work on

An October 5 theft from the 
Chemistry Department resulted 
in more than just lost computer 
hardware.
One stolen hard drive contained 
old exams, according to Chemis­
try Department officials.
But the department sees the 
theft of around $9,000 of Macin­
tosh computer equipment as more 
pressing, especially since it in­
cluded a relatively new Ap­
pleShare server used to distrib­
ute handouts and other informa­
tion to students across the cam­
pus AppleTalk network.
Between 9 pm on October 4 and 
9 am on October 5, a burglar 
entered room 2414 in Doherty
Hall and removed a Macintosh II, 
a Macintosh Plus, several hard 
drives, and a VCR—a total value 
of just over $8,700, according to 
Sergeant William Ricci of the 
CMU Campus Police.
“There were no current tests or 
grades on those computers,” said 
Charles H. VanDyke, a chemistry 
professor and the department’s 
director of undergraduate stud­
ies. “There were some memos and 
instructional handouts, but that’s 
all of value. The grades are kept 
on another computer, [and] that’s 
ultra-secure.”
VanDyke sees the loss of the 
Chemistry AppleShare server, 
which students could access from 
any Macintosh connected to the 
campus network, as more damag­
ing to the department.
“It’s really disrupted the server,” 
he said. “We were just getting 
started using the server to dis­
tribute class information elec­
tronically. It was working really 
well.”
According to Ricci, there were 
no signs of forced entry into the 
office. Although there was no clear 
break-in, VanDyke is confident 
that the stolen equipment will be 
covered by insurance.
“There will be sort of an [insur­
ance] investigation,” he said.
“We think we’re covered. If [the 
lost computers] aren’t insured, 
we’re probably not going to re­
place them, for lack of funds.”
After the theft, the department 
installed a new electronic secu­
rity system and changed all of its 
locks, VanDyke said.

The H&SS College Council 
will try to develop a college- 
wide policy for charges made 
by academic departments to 
cover course-related copying 
charges, according to H&SS 
Assoicate Dean Joseph Devine. 
Such fees are typically applied 
in either very large courses or 
those which copy unusually 
large quantities of materials.
At the center of the contro­
versy lies an introductory sta­
tistics course sequence for 
H&SS students, 36-209 and 
36-210. The sequence is part of 
the H&SS core curriculum and 
is usually taken in a student’s 
sophomore year. Currently, 
students are charged five dol­
lars each semester to cover the 
cost of copying course materi­
als such as class notes and 
homework solutions.
Several other departments
in the University charge course 
fees. Although policies vary 
widely between individual de­
partments, the fees almost 
always only cover copying costs 
for course-related materials.
History Department Head 
Peter Steams maintains that 
copying portions of text actu­
ally saves students money. He 
points out that the alternative 
would be to have students buy 
entire textbooks. Stearns be­
lieves that even after paying a 
course fee, the cost to students 
is less than it would be if that 
were necessary.
What is unique about the 
statistics course is that the fee 
is charged for non-textual 
material. Only a very small 
portion of the copying for the 
course is from texts, and nei­
ther students nor administra­
tors are not happy with the 
current fee.
“Why should we have to pay 
beyond tuition?” asked Maria
Irwin, an H&SS sophomore en­
rolled in 36-209. “Wedon’t even 
get enough handouts to justify 
a five dollar fee.”
Statistics Department Head 
John Lehoczky agrees that in 
the current situation, “every­
body is a loser.” Lehoczy said 
the fee burdens not only stu­
dents but also those faculty 
and staff responsible for col­
lection of the fee.
Although Lehoczky dis­
agrees with the fee in prin­
ciple, he points out that it is a 
financial necessity. “The prob­
lem is strictly one of cash flow 
and budget balancing,” he said.
Approximately six hundred 
students take the introductory 
statistics sequence each year, 
accounting for a total of $3,000 
paid by the students in an 
academic year. According to 
Lehoczky, this only slightly 
defrays the total copying costs 
for the course. After paying

Academic Computing releases 
MacMail, beta version of Mac/IP
Academic Computing has released MacMail Version 0.5, a 
program that allows access to the Andrew Message System from 
a Macintosh, to campus.
Academic Computing is distributing MacMail and the new 
Mac/IP 3.1 software with the appropriate documentation.
Current versions of supported Mac networking software are 
incompatible with MacMail. As a result, test versions of Mac/IP
3.1 and TN3270 software have also been released. The test 
version of Mac/IP 3.1 has proven to be stable, according to 
Academic Computing Officials.
Users should not use both Mac/IP 3.0 and Mac/IP 3.1 on the 
same machine. Both MacMail and Mac/IP 3.1 require system 
6.0.3 of the Macintosh operating system. System 6.0.3 is avail­
able from Academic Computing.
MacMail users should monitor the official.computing-news 
and the cmu.mac-mail bulletin board for updates.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Secre­
tary of State James A. Baker III 
invited the foreign ministers of 
Israel and Egypt to Washington 
during the next two weeks to seek 
a formula for Israeli-Palestinian 
talks, Israeli officials said.
On the condition, of anonymity, 
they also said that Baker pre­
sented a five-point proposal to Is­
raeli Foreign Minister Moshe 
Arens and Egyptian Foreign 
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
The U.S. plan was put forward 
after Israel’s 12-member decision­
making Inner Cabinet rejected a 
Labor Party proposal to accept an 
Egyptian call for talks with a 
Palestinian delegation in Cairo.
Initial reaction to the Baker 
proposal was positive from both 
major parties in the coalition gov­
ernment.
But Likud officials later indi­
cated more study was needed 
before Israel could accept the U.S. 
plan or even the call for a three- 
way meeting in Washington.
There was no immediate reac­
tion from Egypt.

BERLIN (DJ) — East 
Germany’s ruling Politburo was 
scheduled to meet today for the 
first time since massive pro-de­
mocracy demonstrations spread 
to more than a half-dozen cities, 
including 70,000 people at one 
march in Leipzig yesterday.
No violence was reported last 
night in Leipzig, when the dem­
onstrators paraded in the 
country’s largest single protest 
since a 1953 uprising was put 
down by Soviet troops.
Three Communist officials in 
the city promised to seek a dia­
logue with the growing opposi­
tion, in the first significant sign of 
any breakthrough in the country’s 
hard-line stance.
Today’s meeting is also the first 
session of the Politboro since 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gor­
bachev urged East German leader 
Erich Honecker to undertake 
reforms, during a lengthy meet­
ing in East Berlin.
But the 77-year-old Honecker 
has given no indication that he 
will change his government’s 
course.
In a meeting with Chinese Vice 
Prime Minister Yao Yilin yester­
day, Honecker repeated his alle­
gations that Western “imperial­
ists” are poised to threaten his 
country.
Negotiations to 
reduce chemical 
weapons continue
WASHINGTON (AP) — The 
U.S. will continue producing
chemical weapons over a 10-yeai 
phaseout period even after an. 
international treaty is signed it 
rid the world of all poison ga$ 
stockpiles, an administration of­
ficial said today.
The text of a global treaty being' 
negotiated by about 40 nations in 
Geneva proposes to stop all pro, 
duction activities and to close the 
plants.
The administration official 
speaking on condition of anonym, 
ity, said the treaty language has 
not been agreed upon, and that 
the U.S. wants to be able to keejl 
its stockpiles up to date even as jt 
scales them down.
President Bush, in a speech lj 
the United Nations on September.
25, said once a global treaty is 
signed, the U.S. will destroy 91 
percent of its chemical weapons 
over an eight-year period if the' 
Soviet Union does the same.
Bush said the remaining stock- 
piles would be destroyed over the 
next two years if the treaty, c 
universal'y accepted.

WASHINGTON (DJ) — In re­
sponse to questions at a White 
House press conference, President 
Bush defended his response to 
the attempted coup in Panama 
last week. “I have not seen any 
fact in all the reports that have 
come out that would have made 
me do something different in 
terms of (using) force,” he said.
The president reiterated that 
he would like to see General 
Noriega removed from office in 
Panama, noting that he is an 
indicted drug dealer.
He said he thought the situ­
ation in Panama was “more un­
settled than before,” adding that 
“I don’t think anything is out of 
the question” when asked what 
further action he expected.
He said, “I wouldn’t mind using 
force if it could be done in a pru­
dent manner. I am not ruling out 
the use of force for all time. I’m 
going to look at each situation.”
Bush left open the possibility 
that American involvement in
Panama might have gone differ­
ently. “If circumstances in this 
coup attempt had been different 
... we might well have done some­
thing different,” he said.
The president said that the U.S. 
is reviewing its procedures for 
dealing with coup attempts to see 
“if we can’t do it better.”
He also said, however, that 
enough is known about the recent 
operation to know that the U.S. 
would not have done anything 
differently. He repeated that the 
U.S. goals are to bring Noriega to 
justice and to put Panama under 
democratic rule.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The 
House overwhelmingly approved 
a statutory ban on burning or 
defacing the American flag and 
sent it to President Bush despite 
his preference for a constitutional 
amendment to do the job.
“This is the least we can do to 
protect the sanctity of the flag,” 
Rep. Butler Derrick (D-S.C.) said 
before the measure cleared the 
House, 371—43.
The bill calls for up to one year
in jail and a $1,000 fine for any­
one who “knowingly mutilates, 
defaces, physically defiles, bums, 
maintains on the floor or ground, 
or tramples upon any flag of the 
United States.”
House Speaker Thomas Foley 
(D-Wash.) said he assumed Bush 
would sign the bill, despite his 
call for a constitutional amend­
ment and remarklast week that a 
simple statute, merely changing 
the law, would be inadequate.
The Senate plans to vote next 
Monday on a proposed constitu­
tional amendment of the type 
sought by Bush. The House is ex­
pected to act on it later.

with the clinic and its patient1 
and to have destroyed property/ 
Justice Byron White wrote'#

.The University 
Master Plan
Third in a series
JjrMICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
’A committee formed by the 
Board of Trustees last May will 
¿ake its recommendations for the 
University Center Program to the 
îÇôard in November.
Controversy surrounded the 
University Center last spring 
*hen the administration an­
nounced that the project had been 
¡pdstponedbecause fundraising for 
%e center was experiencing some 
difficulties. In the weeks that 
fallowed the announcement, stu­
dents and student organizations 
rallied in protest of the decision.
The committee was appointed 
iy the trustees as a result of stu­
dent concerns.
Specifically, the trustees 
charged the committee with four 
duties: to determine the potential 
for fundraising and to develop a 
Strategy for fundraising; to make 
[a detailed cost estimate of the 
original plan; to study thepro-
“If, in fact, fundraising looks really dismal, obviously the 
whole concept of the University Center and the renova­
tion of Skibo and the size of the building will take on a 
different light than it currently does."
— Vice President for University Planning Patrick Keating
posed building to determine if the 
needs that the original Univer­
sity Center was designed to sat­
isfy still exist, and if those needs 
have changed to adapt the pro­
gram to meet the newly emerged 
needs; and to consider smaller 
alternatives to the current pro­
posal for the University Center, 
including incorporating the reno­
vation of Skibo.
“The University Center is the 
centerpiece of the University 
Master Plan,” says Vice Presi­
dent for University Planning 
Patrick Keating. He believes 
“something like [the University 
Center]—slightly smaller—will 
be built, adopting the major prin­
ciples and architectural style.”
“Success in fundraising has a 
bearing on what we decide to do 
in the end,” says Keating. “If, in 
fact, fundraising looks really dis­
mal, obviously the whole concept 
of the University Center and the 
renovation of Skibo and the size 
of the building will take on a dif- 
ferentlightthanit currently does.” 
Keating described what he 
called “best-case and worst-case” 
scenarios: “In the best-case sce­
nario, the fundraising is good and 
we can proceed with the original 
idea or something close to it. In 
the worst-case scenario, phasing 
— constructing the center in 
phases — is a possibility.”
One major choice facing the 
committee involves whether the 
existing Skibo Hall will be incor­
porated into the University Cen­
ter, or if it will be torn down and 
replaced by a completely new 
structure.
“If it’s vastly cheaper to reno­
vate Skibo, well be pressed to do 
that. The issue is ‘build new1 or
‘renovate and add’ because no 
matter how much you renovate, 
you still only have 50 or 60 thou­
sand square feet,” says Keating.
According to Keating, the cur­
rent University Center proposal 
includes approximately 170 thou­
sand square feet, devoted to stu­
dent activities, social/recrea­
tional, and sports/fitness space. 
Skibo currently provides approxi­
mately 60 thousand square feet 
for student activities and social/ 
recreational functions.
Keating feels that something 
smaller than the originally pro- 
posedUniversity Center will 
probably be built. “It’s more real­
istic to double rather than triple 
[the existing amount of space]. 
It’s all a function of funding.”
Emphasis in fundraising is 
being placed on obtaining “major 
gifts,” Keating said. “Once we get 
some success with big gifts, I’d 
like to see every student organi­
zation undertake some kind of
fundraising effort,” he said. 
“Whatever that organizationdoes 
and is interested in[itcanuseto] 
find ways to raise money for the 
center. I think that the time for 
that, however, is down the road. 
Now is not the time for it.”
Keating said that the commit­
tee will recommend that the 
University begin some type of 
construction within three years.
Several factors will affect the 
cost estimates of both options. 
“[Skibo] is not structurally sound. 
It’s slipping a bit,” said Keating. 
He said that structural problems 
exist on the side of the building 
facing the tennis courts, where a

Tartan Staffwriter
In a move considered by many 
to, be the beginning of the aboli­
tion of alcohol at Carnegie Mel­
lon, the Council of Fraternity 
Presidents decided October 5 that 
no alcohol may be served at CFP- 
sponsored events.
However, CFP failed to adopt 
¡v any of the stricter enforcement- 
'•elated proposals brought up at 
an earlier meeting; those propos­
als were supported primarily by 
Alpha Tau Omega, which was not 
represented at the meeting.
_ The October 5 meeting was held 
CFP to determine the magni­
tude of policy changes that should 
be instituted. According to CFP 
President Phil Antonson, “CFP 
supports the University alcohol 
policy and also the local and state
cohol laws.”
: Antonson, a Theta Xi brother, 
said the council concurred that 
“no alcohol should be present at 
any events organized by CFP.” 
Jiowever, Antonson conceded that 
£this isn’t going to result in any 
major changes.” He considers the 
policy move a stepping stone to 
future policy modifications.
; Beta Theta Pi President Dave 
^kinner agrees, referring to the 
restriction as “a move in the right 
direction.”
j Micheál O’Toole, vice-president 
of Alpha Tau Omega, referred to 
{he policy move as “a small step” 
|>ver an issue “blown way out of 
proportion.” “Prohibition may
happen,” said O’Toole, “but not 
because of this.” However, O’Toole 
warned, “down the line, I can 
definitely see a dry campus.” 
Brain Mikol, president of ATO, 
summarized ATO’s policy of self­
regulation. “We’ll still follow CFP 
regulations, of course,” said Mikol, 
“but ATO’s going to do its own 
thing.”
According to Mikol, ATO was 
notrepresented at the October 5 
meeting because he was unable 
to attend for personal reasons.
Referring to the results of the 
meeting, Director of Greek Af­
fairs Ron.Campana said, “At least, 
if they’re struggling with the is­
sue, it’s a positive step.” 
However, said Campana, the 
University has not and will not 
issue a formal statement on CFP’s 
decision. “The University wants 
all our student groups to take a 
serious look at any kinds of prob­
lems they may have and try to 
come up with some solutions,” he 
said.
At the meeting, dissention was 
limited. Arguments on both sides, 
according to Antonson, were 
“nothing new.” Feedback from 
other fraternity presidents, he 
said, indicated that “they see the 
inevitable happening.“
“It’s gonna be dry,” said Delta 
Tau Delta President John Bush. 
He sees the future of alcohol at 
CMU fraternities as one of tem­
perance.
Antonson believes that the fi­
nal destination of future policy 
shifts could be prohibition. How­
ever, he said, “I don’t think that 
will happen for a long time, un­
less there is an unfortunate inci­
dent.”
Antonson described how the 
risks of an incident are being 
slowly reduced. “Every month, 
every year, the risks are reduced; 
by that, I mean the fraternities 
are becoming more responsible.” 
Recently, fraternities have been 
carding guests and confiscating 
the car keys of intoxicated par- 
tygoers who want to drive.

salaries and other necessary 
costs, there is simply not enough 
money left in the department’s 
budget to cover costs of copying.
“There ought to be a way to 
alleviate this nuisance charge,” 
said Lehoczky. He recom­
mended a University-wide or 
college-wide policy discourag­
ing course fees except in un­
usual situations (that is, where 
texts are being copied and the 
volume is tremendous). Such a 
policy, he said, “might get de­
partments to think if there’s a 
better way to cover costs.”
Several options are available 
to the council. One involves 
implementing one department’s 
policy throughout H&SS.
Most departments in the 
University either do not charge 
fees at all or do not have a con­
sistent policy. In the Philoso­
phy Department, for example, 
each instructor decides whether 
or not the quantity of material 
warrants a fee.
Other departments have set
limits above which students are 
charged. The Department of 
Mechanical Engineering has a 
limit of eighty copies per student 
in a given course, while the His­
tory Department covers $25 to 
$30 worth of copying per course. 
The weakness of the latter policy, 
according to Stearns, is that 
courses with more students are 
more likely to exceed the limit.
The Department of Social and 
Decision Sciences charges stu­
dents five cents per copy for texts 
copied for a course, but does not 
charge for regular course materi-
In all the other departments 
surveyed, course fees.were only 
charged when texts or portions 
of text were being copied.
Devine sees several options 
that are open to the council. 
One would involve a “copying 
pool” used by all the depart­
ments in the college. In this 
way, at least a portion of copy­
ing costs would not have to 
come out of the departmental 
budget, and course fees could 
be eliminated.
Obviously, though, there 
would be problems with that 
plan, says Devine. Departments 
that do little copying would feel 
shortchanged, as would depart­
ments whose budgets were 
changed in order to implement 
the new copying pool.
Another option, according to 
Devine, would be for a depart­
ment to exhibit a “unique need” 
for money to cover copying costs. 
“The department would build 
an additional request into its 
budget proposal,” he said.

Fence, Union struck by anti-gay vandals

vandalism, but declined to file a 
report.
Student Union Editorial Col­
lective members Kevin DeYager 
and Matt Ruben said that 1000 
ofthe 3000 Student Union news­
papers were taken sometime be­
tween late Wednesday night 
and early Thurday morning.
The two said that theybelieve 
the papers were stolen instead 
of circulated because the strings 
that keep the papers bundled 
had disappeared along with the 
papers, as though they were 
stolen in mass quantity.
The Union contained a five- 
page spread on National Com­
ing Out Day.
According to GALA member 
Vincent Matsko, the purpose of 
National Coming Out Day was 
“to encourage people to come 
out in their own way.”
The program included films, 
pamphlets and pins, anda panel 
activity where the audience 
must try to guess the sexual 
preference of each panel par­
ticipant by asking questions. 
Heterosexuals, as well as gays 
and lesbians, were encouraged 
to attend.
Matsko said that members 
discussed how they wanted to 
respond to the vandalism. “We 
discussed it. No' immediate

that there are people who are intol­
erant or who are prejudiced. ”

action was taken. We considered 
repainting the Fence for Home­
coming weekend if it was fea­
sible. It wasn’t feasible because 
there were several groups who 
were already guarding the fence.”
Roy Conard, GALA steering 
committee member, referred to 
the incident as “another thing of a 
long line of things to happen.”
According to GALA member 
Matt Parker, the fence had been 
painted Monday night and had 
been guarded until 2 pm Tues­
day. At that time, Parker, who 
had been guarding the fence, went 
home.
Later, the whitewashing took 
place, just before sundown Tues­
day. An unknown individual was 
observed spreading whitewash 
only over those areas of the fence 
that had gay and lesbian com­
ments.
According to a GALA member 
who wished to remain anony­
mous, most gays were extremely 
displeased with the whitewash­
ing.
He advocated strong action 
upon those who whitewashed 
the fence. “My straight friends 
were pisse, too,” he said.
He elaborated that, in his 
opinion, the incident broke 
school tradition because the 
Fence was only painted par­
tially and because it was 
painted before dark.
In addition, he said he feels 
that the incident was an act of 
sexual discrimination as de­
fined by University policy.
Matsko felt that the unre­
paired vandalism made a state­
ment to the campus commu­
nity. “I think that it allowed 
people to see that there are 
people who are intolerant or 
who are prejudiced.”
Matsko said that the vandal­
ism might have actually help 
increase awareness of gay and 
lesbian issues. “I certainly don’t 
condone [what was done to the 
fence], but it’s not unexpected 
and I think the publicity that it 
will generate is what’s needed.”

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 17 October 1989 5
. CMU planners for Pittsburgh Technology Center return to drawing board
According to Dr. William M. Kaufman, 
director of Mellon Institute and vice 
president for applied research, it was 
not until the project was on the verge 
of the third stage that the decision to 
temper costs necessitated a funda­
mental restructuring of the design.

initial stages. “We had to go 
through two different administra­
tions because [former Pennsylva- 
. nia Governor Richard] Thornburg 
r' "1 ' was in office when this all started,” 
said McCormick, “and suddenly 
he was out of office and a lot of it 
had to start over again with a
- joa whole new set of people.”
The Urban Redevelopment 
f ^ Authority was given $20 million 
for purchase and reconditioning 
roi of the 48 acre plot of land that was 
r ' formerly a steel mill site. Through 
a series of agreements and a ar­
rangements, the University of 
1 Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon 
- were each allotted portions of the 
site for “high-tech research and
- development activities.”
As stipulated in the agreement 
between the URA and the Re­
ft’" gional Industrial Development 
Corporation, Carnegie Mellon was 
given approximately 10.8 acres, 
on which it will be permitted to

course development to improve 
the present courses — I believe 
we’ll be underwriting a speaker 
series where we will be bringing 
1 some big name entrepreneurs on 
campus from time to time.” 
Thorne also foresees the initia­
tion of a research program that 
up until now had been put off due 
to lack of funds.
The new plans for the entrepre­
neur program will cost more than 
the donation. “The amount he 
gave, although substantial, is not 
enough to run the center for very 
long. We are going to use his major
i gift as a lightening rod to attract 
additional money.”
In the spring, Jones accepted 
an adjunct professorship in GSIA 
andnowco-teaches a class in basic
construct up to 300,000 gross 
square feet of development, plus 
parking. The University of Pitts­
burgh was given approximately
9.2 acres on which it may develop
250.000 gross square feet, plus 
parking.
Money was granted by the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
for the development and construc­
tion of one building each, with the 
provision that each develop facili­
ties equal in value to those pro­
vided by the state. “There’s a 
dollar for dollar match,” said 
McCormick.
CMU received $17 million, 
which it will use to construct a
90.000 square foot facility to house 
Mellon Institute and its research 
related activities. The University 
plans to match that amount by 
constructing an additional specu­
lative office/research building to 
be funded and developed by the 
Oxford Development Company. 
Because of the setbacks encoun-
entrepreneurship. He will be 
teaching his own class entitled 
“Entrepreneurial Management.” 
Three other adjunct professors 
are teaching at GSIA, saidThome. 
“In addition to Don Jones, Jack 
Roseman, Tom Canfield, and 
Frank Demmler are all people 
with immense experience in busi­
ness and are teaching on a part 
time basis.”
As an avid supporter of eco­
nomic development and revitali­
zation, Jones serves on the boards 
of several companies and institu­
tions, and has received many 
awards and honors, including the 
1986 Enterprise Award for busi­
ness leadership and an Outstand­
ing Alumni Award from the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh in 1987. 
Jones made the decision to help
tered, Kaufman expects a late 
1991 to early 1992 initial con­
struction date for the first build­
ing.
The University of Pittsburgh 
received $14 million, with which 
it will construct an 87,000 square 
foot facility to house the 
University’s biotechnology, bio­
engineering, and medical re­
search programs.
Pitt’s current plans are to match 
this facility by the construction of 
three additional buildings, for 
which it is soliciting tenants in a 
wide variety of technology and 
research fields. Samuel A. 
Schulhof, associate vice president 
for applied research, said that the 
precise nature and the number of 
additional buildings will ulti­
mately be determined by those 
tenants.
The final plans for Pitt’s build­
ing have been completed by the 
architectural firm of Bohlin, 
Powell, Larkin, and Cywinski —
Carnegie Mellon’s business school 
establish the entrepreneur cen­
ter because he said it has “demon­
strated a high degree of excel­
lence and has been a springboard 
for new businesses.” According to 
a recent survey, 28 percent of the 
school’s alumni are now engaged 
in entrepreneurial ventures and 
half of the remaining graduates 
are planning entrepreneurial 
careers.
Jones earned an electrical engi­
neering degree from the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh in 1959. Since 
then, he has founded and sold 
three companies and acquired 15 
patents. Currently, he is presi­
dent of DHJ Enterprises Inc., a 
non-profit organization designed 
to form and acquire new business 
enterprises.
the same firm that designed 
Carnegie Mellon’s Software En­
gineering Institute. Currently, 
Pitt has submitted an environ­
mental impact study in accor­
dance with standard procedures.
Upon approval of the study by 
the Department of Environmental 
Regulation, Schulhof said that the 
Pennsylvania Department of 
General Services will begin ac­
cepting bids for construction, a

hill had been cleared away to 
facilitate the construction of the 
building. “If we decide to keep 
[Skibo], we must adjust the fig­
ures for repair.”.
Heating and cooling systems 
are also problem areas for Skibo. 
“The mechanical systems in 
Skibo are about gone. In three 
to five years, all of the air condi­
tioning units will have to be 
replaced,” Keating said. In ad­
dition, the building is not very 
economical to heat or cool, he 
said.
Regardless of whether Skibo 
is tom down or renovated and 
enlarged, asbestos used in its
process which will take 45 days. 
Finally, there will be a 30 day 
review process, after which con­
struction can begin.
“The sooner we get our first 
building under construction, the 
easier it is to convince other people 
that the project is real,” said 
Schulhof. “All the brochures in 
the world don’t sell anything until 
somebody sees some construc­
tion.”
construction will have to be re­
moved first.
Keating said that he felt asbes­
tos removal would be more ex­
pensive if the building is com­
pletely torn down than if the 
building is only renovated, be­
cause completely tearing down 
the building would require all 
asbestos to be removed, which 
would not necessarily be true in 
the case of Skibo renovation.
Another topic of discussion 
regarding the center has been the 
use of space in Skibo that will 
open when Kiltie Café is closed 
and the new dining hall is opened 
in Tech Hall.
According to Keating, possibili-
According to a report by the 
URA, when fully completed in 
2004, the center will provide about 
4,200 permanent newjobs in Pitts­
burgh, with an additional 6,700 
possible in “such areas as suppli­
ers, business, services, and in­
dustrial expansion.” By that same 
year, the report projects an esti­
mated $260 million in investment.
By 1995 the center is projected 
to account for some $1 million 
annually in tax revenues. That 
amount should increase to $1.5 
million by the year 2000, and over 
$3 million by 2004. SaidKaufman, 
“I think this will be an important 
project for the city as well as for 
Carnegie Mellon.”
“The state has put this money 
in believing that the two univer­
sities are major players in the 
economic revitalization of the 
region,” said Schulhof, “and that 
they will help to attract compa­
nies not only to that site, but to 
other sites.”
ties for the use of current Kiltie 
space include the expansion of 
the activity/pool/gameroom 
area, and moving the “college 
store” — sales of assorted Car­
negie Mellon items like sweat­
shirts and pennants—into part 
of that area.
Another possibility includes 
moving the Tartan Grill into 
part of that area, allowing the 
current location of the Grill to 
be used for student organiza­
tion office space.
Any investment in that space 
should be minimal, Keating 
urged. “We don’t want to make 
major renovations in that space 
to use only a year or two.”

ORCHESTRATING IC DESIGN
JAM SESSION
— ((3,rp(iiâ Ciip P(3,î5iip(iim i(hFsTiFWâ^On-Campus Jam Session
October 11, 1989
In 1782, in the court of Emperor Joseph II, a 
brash young composer named Wolfgang Amadeus 
Mozart set the music world on its ear. A radical 
departure from the current fashion in music, 
he set a new standard for style and composition.
It has always been so. The old guard surpassed 
by a new wave. It’s true today in the area of 
software tools for IG Design Automation (ICDA). 
Cadence broke with the conventional order to 
create the industry’s only completely integrated 
ICDA software solution. Our high-performance 
CAD/CAE tools are coordinated into one har­
monious environment, allowing the user to 
arrange the entire IC design process from 
design entry to final verification.
Our approach to integrating the IC design 
process has made Cadence the leader in ICDA 
software. Significantly larger than our nearest • 
competitor, we are a financially-secure, fully- 
resourced company. And we’re growing at 70% 
a year. That’s twice as fast as the industry average.
The expertise we’ve acquired by orchestrating 
different elements and helping them to work

FORUM
There are rules to rhetoric
Tuesday night, some people 
decided that the announcement of 
! National Coming Out Day did not 
deserve to stand on the Fence. 
Their response was to splash white 
; paint over segments of the Fence, 
leaving the majority of the struc­
ture untouched — an act which 
broke both the rules of the Fence 
: and the rules of civilized behav­
ior.
Last week was not the first time 
the Fence has been defaced with­
out respect for tradition. Organi­
sations that hold the Fence for 
long periods are often the victims 
: of paint-throwing, contrary to the 
unwritten rule that the Fence 
must be painted in its entirety. 
Some unscrupulous groups have 
bent or violated the “after-dark” 
rule or taken the Fence in spite of 
another group’s prior claim.
Although not formally recorded 
in any way, the Fence rules are 
'sufficiently powerful to lend a 
structure to the anarchy of Fence- 
; sitting. They allow the Fence to 
| transcend its role as bulletin board 
land become something more: a 
haven of free expression in the 
middle of campus.
; The Fence’s role in campus dia­
logue and debate makes last 
week’s incident all the more objec­
tionable.
If the defacers had a message, 
they could have painted the Fence 
properly; it was unguarded. If they 
had a clear statement to make, 
they could have made it in full 
view of the campus community; 
they had that right.
Instead, they acted as cowards. 
They attacked another group’s 
message out of insensitivity, hate, 
and ignorance, without the intel- 
ligencetobe coherent—and with­
out the confidence to do it in a re­
sponsible, public forum.
Either offense alone — the inar­
ticulate grunt of homophobia or 
the inconsiderate attack on the 
Fence — is contemptible. In com­
bination, they are not to be toler­
ated.
Constructive dialogue is part of 
the spirit of the Fence, and through 
it part of the soul of the campus 
community.
We must not allow that spirit to 
be stifled because of the worst in 
us. We cannot keep throwingpaint 
at things we don’t understand in 
the imbecilic hope that they will 
go away.
We need student discounts
Congress may restrict the dis­
counts which many computer 
manufacturers offer universities.
Under one section of the pro­
posed Unrelated Business Income 
Tax Changes, currently being 
considered by the House Ways 
and Means Committee, universi­
ties will have to severely restrict 
¡computer sales on campuses or 
;face unreasonable taxes.
If the bill is passed with the re­
strictions intact, university per­
sonnel will see two major changes 
in current computer sale policies. 
Students will be prohibited from 
buying computers at educational 
prices from campus re-sellers 
without pel-mission slips from pro­
fessors stating the equipment is 
required for a class. Faculty and 
staff members will be prevented 
from purchasing computers at 
educational prices altogether.
The clause which states students 
can enjoy discounts only if a com­
puter is required for a class is 
pointless; what professor is going 
to require students to buy a com­
puter system for just one class?
Congress is being pressured to 
pass these changes by computer 
retailers, who would like nothing 
better than to see students and

Fraternities should not defend turf like gangs
faculty buy equipment from them 
for up to 40 percent more.
Not everyone will be affected, 
but these restrictions will have 
seriously detrimental effects on 
some aspects of education at CMU.
How many students who are 
currently considering buying a 
computer from the Computer 
Store will be able to pay up to 
$2,000 more to an off-campus 
retailer? Fewer students will 
purchase computers, and the clus­
ters will become overcrowded. 
Additionally, faculty will be less 
likely to use computer learning 
tools, which are becoming increas­
ingly valuable to education.
If these changes are allowed, it 
will mean the end of discounts for 
students and faculty. Why? So a 
few greedy businessmen can stuff 
their pockets at our expense.
Congress is now hearing only 
from retailers, and it needs to hear 
the other side. The Tartan urges 
you to write your congressman: 
U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, D.C., 20515. Also 
write the House Ways and Means 
Committee at the same address.
Speak up now. Don’t let one lobby 
group force Congress into fixing 
something that isn’t broken.
Editor:
I wholeheartedly agree' with your 
“Adapt or Die” editorial [“Fraternities 
must change with the times” 10/3], which 
encourages the Council of Fraternity 
Presidents to police its members’ use of 
alcohol. I would also like to commend 
CFP for the actions it has taken toward 
stricter controls on fraternity drinking. 
If something is not done to minimize the 
harmful effects of alcohol abuse, there 
are sure to be unhealthy effects, such as 
I have continually seen throughout my 
six years at colleges and universities. 
Continued emotional and physical dam­
age, and even an occasional death, are 
seen on campuses across the country.
However, I found it quite ironic that 
ATO was leading the effort to control 
fraternity drinking, especially given its 
actions during its recent pledge night. 
Neither I, nor any of my friends, at­
tended their pledge night, yet, we were 
innocent victims of their drunken anger. 
As we passed their house that night, we 
were assaulted for walking on .THEIR
Letters to the Editor
grass, the end result of which was bro­
ken glass becoming embedded in my 
friend’s head. As we left that situation, 
we walked home to our apartment in 
Oakland. Along the way, we were again 
assaulted by ATO as several of their 
brothers left an Oakland bar. Yet an­
other incident occurred that night as a 
colleague of mine needed medical atten­
tion after he was attacked by several 
members of ATO outside a Shadyside 
bar. It seems quite clear that ATO knows 
the dangers of alcohol abuse.
Perhaps, however, their actions were 
not attributable to their abuse of alcohol, 
but, instead, to their vigorous protection 
of territorial rights, which is observable 
in many CMU fraternities.
Everywhere we go, we are told to stay 
off THEIR grass, get out of THEIR bar, 
and we are physically assaulted when 
we cross THEIR sidewalk hundreds of
feet in front of THEIR buggy. May I 
remind them that much of the campus is 
owned by Carnegie Mellon, and is not 
their own private domain? May I suggest 
that no fraternity member should act as 
if they own the whole world (because 
they don’t)? The last time I saw someone 
defend their turf as aggressively was 
when I saw inner city gangs killing each 
other over the right to sell crack cocaine 
in a south central Los Angeles neighbor­
hood.
I hope that CFP decided last week to 
limit the fraternities’ use of alcohol. But 
this decision will certainly not be enough 
to" keep the frats happy. Maybe they 
would feel more comfortable if we gave 
them chains and knives, with which they 
could protect their precious territory. 
That way, when we walk on THEIR 
grass, they can enforce their territorial 
rights the only way they know how — 
with excessive and senseless violence.

Crash! The social standing of men and 
the rights of women have been hurled 
back into the Dark Ages. On Wednesday, 
October 4, a jury in Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida acquitted Steven Lord of rape, 
because the victim wore a lace mini-skirt 
and no underwear.
Where the hell did this jury ever get 
the idea that fashion and rape have any­
thing to do with one another? Rape is an 
act of violence! It is not sexual. Of course 
she wore the skirt to attract people, but 
that’s no reason to expect to be abducted 
and raped repeatedly at knife-point. 
Women are socially alienated from their 
bodies. They may not express themselves 
with their bodies for fear of violence 
against them. Bullshit! I should be able 
to run through the streets nude and 
expect to be arrested for public ludeness, 
but not to be violently assaulted. Women 
all over the country have been outraged 
by this verdict; and men should be too.
This ruling says that men are mind­
less, instinctual aggressors, and that 
woman must take responsibility for these 
beasts by the moderation of their life­
styles. How could a man stand by and 
take this blow to his intellect? My God, 
isn’t Steven Lord a dangerous, mentally 
abnormal human being? He faces sev­
eral other rape and assault charges in 
Georgia.
I want this verdict reversed. If a woman 
says “no,” she means “no.” Nothing else 
can speak for her, not her clothes, her
walk, her physical measurements, noth­
ing! If nature makes it physically more 
difficult for a woman to fend off an 
unwanted sexual attempt, then men 
must triumph over this. And we must 
dispel this “askingfor it” myth. We must 
use our intelligence, our ethics, and our 
social conscience. We must work together 
to end this social scourge.

Anopenlettertothe person whodaubed 
white paint on the fence after GALA had 
painted it for National Coming Out Day: 
Not only were your actions completely 
in vain—a few daubings of paint will not 
deter your fellow lesbian, gay and bisex­
ual students from coming out or prevent
us from being accepted on this campus—I 
but they showed an extraordinary lack of 
school spirit. Tradition firmly demands 
that the fence be painted only at night, 
and then only in its entirety.

The Tartan does not effectively do its job as a newspaper
Editor:
I wish to express my dissatisfaction 
with the large number of errors that 
have appeared in your first five issues. I 
can’t understand why such a seemingly 
competent staff can produce a newspa­
per that is just plain wrong. I feel it is 
time to dust off your style guide and 
redistribute it to your proofreaders, and 
possibly even your reporters. Catching 
capitalizations of major cities (such as 
Pittsburgh), noticing obvious grammati­
cal errors related to possessive nouns,
and producing stories with correct facts 
should be easy hurdles to overcome. The 
Tartan has failed at these tasks.
Events that start at 10 pm are re­
ported to start at 8 pm. Phone numbers 
and names are wrong. Not all parties in­
volved in a story/situation are inter­
viewed. There will be no live band at the 
SDC’s Clippership Dance. The live band 
will be in the Ballroom on Friday night. 
These are errors that should be easy to 
correct, and I am surprised to see such 
negligence on the part of your staff.
Some may think I am nit-picking; yet,' 
how can I be assured that everything 
your newspaper prints is correct if I am * 
finding simple mistakes in such abun­
dance. If you can’t be sure of something, 
then don’t print it. Save it for next week’s 
issue. No one needs to be misinformed, 
and your newspaper has been doing a 
good job ofbad reporting and bad proof­
reading.

Middle East columnist uninformed on history of Lebanese conflict
Editor:
David Schwartz is certainly right to 
examine recent developments and call 
attention to the lack of leadership being 
shown by the international community 
to attempt to help in a resolution of the 
conflict in the Middle East [“The United 
States and the UN must act to stop 
Syrian aggression in Lebanon,” 10/3]. 
But his analysis is flawed to the point of 
being almost laughable, and his pre­
scription for action is absurd.
While few components of the Lebanese 
conflict are clear, it is readily evident to 
anyone interested in more than a super­
ficial examination of Lebanese history 
that the conflict there is due more to 
internal developments rather than ex­
ternal intervention. Placing the blame 
exclusively on the Syrians (particularly 
through the use of quotations by such a 
biased and uninformed observer as 
Jeanne Kirkpatrick) ignores, for one, the 
role that the Palestine Liberation Or­
ganization has played in Lebanon and 
the horrific impact of the Israeli invasion 
in 1982. Mr. Schwartz neglects to ad­
dress the various Lebanese factions such 
as the Druze and the Hezbollah involved 
in the war in Lebanon and gives the
reader absolutely no indication that he 
understands the historical roots of this 
conflict, never mind being aware ofthem.
I am sure that the Gorbachev leader­
ship would be astonished to hear that 
Syria is “under strong Soviet influence,” 
and that “the Soviets, and their major 
Arab allies [whoever they might be this 
week] have a firm grip on the UN.” If this 
were the case, then the Assad regime 
would have been compelled to withdraw 
long ago. Since 1975, the Soviet Union 
has been outspoken in its pleas for a 
political settlement to the war in Leba-

; “[I’ve] found a way to [live out 
there where the real winds blow— pon Pickett 
to sleep late, have fun, get wild, —— 
drink whiskey and drive fast on 
empty streets with nothing in mind 
put falling in love and not getting 
arrested....”
— Hunter S. Thompson
Most people I know like to get 
wild, get crazy, let loose once in a 
while, or at least every weekend. 
But there’s a difference between 
getting wild, and really getting 
out there. Anyone can get wild — 
all it takes is enough balh, maybe 
something to alter the mind chem- 
astry, and it’s “Look ma, Pm grav­
ity testing my roommate from the 
fifth story window.”
People who try to be wild usu­
ally give it up, bum out or die 
stupidly. You can only getwild so 
often. Sooner or later the {ercent- 
£ge catches un with you Game 
over. Then there are th* really 
wild ones who are really oijt there. 
¡They develop an instinct for just 
bow far they can go, hov much 
they can push the envelop». They 
end up living longer than tf e wild, 
ending up old men witl, good 
memories.
Between these two extreires lies
everybody else. And, the really 
funny thing is, if you’re in the 
proper, cynical mood, how many 
people are afraid just to live, to 
face the pain of everyday exis­
tence. It’s amazing how many 
people dive face-first into decep­
tion, denial, and falsehood, just to 
escape the horrible possibility of 
ever being hurt.
There is a given rule: Anything 
worthwhile, anything that you 
will be proud of, involves some 
element or risk, a possibility that 
you will be hurt, either physically 
or mentally.
Pain is a fact of life, whether it 
be nagging guilt, or searing soul- 
bum—you will get hurt once and 
a while.
So, it’s weird when you mn 
across people so afraid of pain 
and hurting that they never admit 
to themselves that it can happen 
to them. You find people to whom, 
it seems, no harm can come. If you 
listen to them, to what they say 
and what they imply, they are un­
touchable.
Bullshit. It is impossible not to
hurt. People like this are deceiv­
ing themselves and hurting those 
around them.
Ask yourself a question: How 
much does it take to live? How 
much does it take to stroll up to 
the edge, lean over, andlook down 
into the abyss; to get that fish-eye 
view of life that puts it all in 
perspective? I don’t mean epic ad­
ventures here, just life. Doingthis 
only takes the ability to have a 
tough skin every once and a while, 
the ability to be able to ignore 
small bruises and cuts.
People who can’t handle pain— 
not real pain, but just the every­
day shit — are hopeless.
I’m not talking about mountain 
climbing, desert crossing, or con­
tinent hopping? Just to last 
through an ordinary, stress-filled 
week is difficult enough for most 
people, but it doesn’t send us 
screaming in fear towards the 
ground.
Everyone has been hurt badly, 
at some time or another. Usually 
people screw you over, but you re­
cover,! You don’t have to carry this 
albatross around your neck. You 
don’t have to face the rest of life 
from a mask of fear.
Those few who wrap themselves
in lies and bullshit and never ac­
cept the responsibility for their 
actions will drag you down if you 
let them. They will constantly 
dump on you, forcing you either to 
accept their problems, or leave 
them alone and let them fall apart.
If you don’t care, you deny them 
the platform for transferring their 
problems; you deny them the op­
portunity to ignore the fact that 
they are hurting and watch them 
disintegrate. Without the oppor­
tunity to unload, facing the dread­
ful knowledge that they can’t 
escape from this, they will ex­
plode. Watch them, along, arcing 
bright streak across the sky, wait 
for the impact, feel the slap in the 
chest as they hit. Crash and bum, 
baby — game over.
It is a terrible thing to say, that 
you would let someone fall apart, 
rather than reach out to help. 
Sometimes you can’t reach out — 
you can’t reach that far, and they 
are afraid to take the hand.

For the third time in seven rears 
the Cubs teased me all sunmer 
with the prospect of a Worli Se­
ries in my home town of Chicago, 
only to dash my hopes by losing 
the play-offs. Six months of htpes 
and prayers were laid to waste by 
a week-long series. An entire sim­
mer of caring more about wiafc 
happened the previous day at'.he 
ballpark than what happened^ 
City Hall, has been ruined bva 
few games.
This time it was the San Fnn- 
cisco Giants who turned ;he 
dreams of a city of Cubs fans, ike 
myself, into another long wiiter.
I congratulate the Giants and 
their fans and wish them luk in 
the World Series, but I wonier if 
it will ever be my turn.
This has long since gon< past 
bad luck and has seemed .0 be-
Jonathan Levy
come a curse. It has been 30 years 
since the White Sox played the 
last World Series game in Chi­
cago when they lost the 1959 series 
to the Los Angeles Dodgers. The 
last time the Cubs were in a World 
Series was in 1945, when they 
won the pennant in a National 
League weakened by World War
II enlistments. Then they lost to 
the American League Champion 
Detroit Tigers.
An entire generation of Chica­
goans has been bom, grown old, 
and died since the White Sox 
brought home Chicago’s most 
recent world championship in 
1917. The Cubs’ last World Series 
title was won in 1908, when my
grandfather was two years old.
What is so permanently wrong 
with my favorite teams? The play­
ers and management have turned 
over countless times, with each 
generation having no more suc­
cess than the previous one. When 
the White Sox move into their 
new ballpark in 1991, even the 
fields will not be the same as 
when the teams won their last 
world championships.
It sometimes seems as if Chi­
cago will never again have a base­
ball champion. Yet, millions of 
people remain loyal to the Cubs 
and White Sox. I’m not completely 
sure why. Maybe it is the natural 
tendency most of us have to root 
for the underdog. Maybe it is some 
horrible addiction, worse than 
crack. Or maybe it is the same 
reason that people continue to
play the same losing lottery 
numbers week after week — the 
fear that the time you stop will be 
the time they finally win.
I don’t know exactly what it is, 
but I do know that it’s too late for 
me to change. I’ll be counting the 
weeks from the end of the World 
Series to the beginning of spring 
training, and when April rolls 
around, I’ll be back out at the 
park begging to have my heart 
broken again.
And who knows? Maybe 1990 
will be the year. Maybe it will be 
the Cubs and White Sox in the 
World Series. Maybe the elusive 
“next year” will finally come.
If not, there’s always 1991.

column in The Tartar [“CMU

grossly sexist and is 1 paranoid 
m^n-hater. But so asnot to get 
carried away with chap potshots 
so reminiscent of he own letter
Letter to the Editor
let me rebut by analyzing said 
letter.
As a prelude, allow me to state 
that Stew’s original column was a 
completely harmless (if not en­
tirely ftmny) attempt at humor. 
Blaire seems driven to impress 
her own twisted view of the world 
onto the column due to some 
underlying emotional-personality 
defects and an apparent lack of
legitimate targets to criticize.
To start, Blaire makes her first 
two errors by stating“... Chatham 
College is set on and centered in 
the acreage of the Andrew W. 
Mellon estate.” By this I am say­
ing the sentence contains a gram­
matical error in the form of a 
redundancy. Stew referred to 
CMU as being named after Mel­
lon; he never “claim[ed] Mr. Mel­
lon solely for CMU,” as Blaire 
states.
Blaire’s third mistake comes 
right after she babbles on about
the Andrew W. Mellon House. It 
is only after rereading the para­
graph I decipher that Blaire’s ‘it’ 
refers to Chatham College itself, 
last mentioned in her letter two 
sentences previously. I think that 
if Blaire is not yet familiar with 
the Associated Press Stylebook 
that she acquire a copy and be­
come friends with it.
Towards the end of Blaire’s 
letter she criticizes Stew for re­
ferring to Chatham as a school 
rather than a college. However,

How many times have you 
seen a white person tense up 
around a black person, or seen a 
person make fun of a retarded 
person, or make suggestive 
hand gestures at a deaf person 
because “all deaf people know 
sign language?” The people who 
do these things succumb to 
stereotyping these people be­
cause they are “different.” Stere­
otyping is not the right thing to 
do, but it’s the easiest way to 
understand differences, isn’t it?
Well, I’m sorry to say that it 
really is not, and being hearing 
impaired, I am speaking from 
experience.
Growing up in a hearing world 
taught me a lot of things. I 
learned how to communicate 
effectively, but I also learned 
that no matter what I did, some 
people would still see me as 
handicapped before they saw 
me as a person. This has been 
going on for over ten years, but 
I learned how to tough it out.
Unfortunately, two of my 
hearing impaired friends here, 
Jon and Paul, have recently 
been in situations similar to 
mine. They never had to deal 
with these situations before, 
and not having their parents 
around made the burden 
tougher. Luckily, though, since 
I have been through the same 
thing, I am able to help them.
I needed some help, too. One 
very important person on cam­
pus, who has been a victim of 
some stereotyping as well, has 
been there for all of us. Everett 
Tademy, director of Equal Em­
ployment Opportunity/Affirma­
tive Action on campus, has been 
there to listen when we needed 
someone to listen. When we 
were mad, he was mad. When 
we needed help, he gave it to us.
According to Jon, Tademy has 
gone out of his way to help us 
get over some of the obstacles 
that face us. Without him, we 
would probably be having a very 
hard time, because he gives us 
the respect most people do not 
know how to give to handi­
capped people. To Tademy, we 
are individuals who don’t hear 
very well, but we are individu­
als first.
There are some amazing 
things about the three of us. 
First of all, we all like to listen 
to music. Music relaxes us the 
same way it relaxes hearing - 
people. Second, we don’t want 
or need to be shouted at when 
we don’t understand someone 
the first time. When you turn 
the radio up all the way, you.: 
can’t hear the sounds anymore,. 
right? Well, that’s what it is 
like for us when someone shouts.
People are so amazed when 
they meet the three of us be- '¦ 
cause we can talk. Well, sur-' 
prise, not all deaf people use. 
sign language, and the three of, 
us are no exceptions. The only 
reason Paul may not join in con­
versations, for the same reason 
I don’t, is that he does not al­
ways know what is being said, 
and would rather not bother 
someone by asking. But I think 
we have both learned that if 
you really want to know some­
thing, you have to ask. We real­
ize that it doesn’t make us look 
dumb, it makes us look inter­
ested.
Jon hated to be treated like a 
kid and talked down to by his 
peers because they thought he 
wasn’t as smart as them due to. 
his hearing loss. Let me tell 
you, if hearing impaired people 
were not as smart as everyone 
else, they would not have in­
vented telephones, composed 
classics on the piano, or found 
fame in movies and television. 
They would also not attend fine 
schools such as CMU. Let’s face 
it—we came here to get an edu­
cation, and are very determined 
to succeed. I can assure you 
that the three of us are defi­
nitely going to make it.
So quit those stereotypes. 
Make an effort to get to know 
other people before you judge 
them. Chances are, your initial 
judgements will be wrong.
I hope these words have not 
fallen upon deaf ears.

The following is a special col­
umn from President George Bush 
submitted to college newspapers 
across the country. —Ed.
Summer is over and classes are 
back in session. As we begin the 
school year, our thoughts again 
turn to the future — a future 
gravely threatened by drugs.
Americans agree that the big­
gest threat we are facing as a 
nation is drugs, in particular 
cocaine and crack.
Who is responsible? Everyone 
who uses drugs. Everyone who 
sells drugs. Everyone who looks 
the other way.
Some people used to call drugs 
just a benign form of recreation. 
They’re not. Drugs are a real and 
extremely serious threat to our 
schools, our homes, our friends, 
and our families. It doesn’t mat­
ter where you live or what school 
you attend. No one is free from 
the threat of drugs. Inner cities, 
small towns, and college cam­
puses all are under siege — be­
cause America is under siege.
On September 5, I announced 
the first comprehensive national
strategy to end the siege — to 
fight drugs with tougher laws and 
enforcement, and with improved 
treatment, education and preven­
tion. The programs we’ve pro­
posed are an all-out assault 
against the veil of drug use and 
drug trafficking. We are aggres­
sively attackingthe problem from 
every angle, and proposing a 1990 
drug-budget totaling over eight 
billion dollars—the largest single 
increase in history.
America is fighting a war 
against drugs. Yet the most im­
portant weapons in the war on 
drugs are the least tangible: self- 
discipline, courage, character, 
support from one’s family, faith 
in God and in one’s self.
Fundamentally, the drug prob­
lem is not one of supply, but of 
demand. We are taking strong 
new action to stop the flow of 
drugs into this country and to 
stop the dealers themselves; but 
as long as Americans are willing 
to buy illegal drugs, somebody in 
the world will sell them.
Recently, I met with Mrs. Ever­
ett Hatcher, the widow of a vet­
eran DEA agent who was killed
by drug-using cowards. A woman 
of considerable dignity, she put 
responsibility for her husband’s 
death squarely on “casual” users 
of cocaine. She’sright—and there 
is now blood on their hands. 
Similarly, President Barco of 
Colombia recently made an ap­
peal to Americans to stop buying 
the cocaine causing the slaughter 
of innocent civilians in the drug 
wars there.
Every student in America at 
some point — at a party, in a 
locker room, in a dorm room — 
every student must choose to 
accept or reject drugs. But there 
is another choice that college 
students, as responsible adults, 
must make — whether to get 
involved in a personal way to end 
drug use, or to look the other way.
College campuses have long 
been centers of conscience and 
idealism in this country, places 
where students have raised their 
voices to protest oppression, in­
justice and human suffering 
around the world. Yet, no one 
would deny that often drugs go 
hand in hand with injustice, suf­
fering and even death. But where
is the sound of protest? Innocent 
bystanders are killed at random 
on city streets, babies are bom 
addicted to crack and heroin, and 
young children are forced into the 
drug trade by addicts. What 
greater human rights violations 
exist? What greater injustices? 
Yet, recreational drug users still 
on some college campuses are am­
bivalent to the death and destruc­
tion they are financing.
We must appeal to the social 
conscience of every college stu­
dent on every college campus in 
America. The way to protest the 
misery and oppression brought 
about by drugs is to commit your­
self to staying away from drugs— 
and working to keep them away 
from your friends.
Drug use doesn’t usually begin 
the way most people would think, 
with young people getting their 
first drugs from an addict or a 
dealer. Instead, they get them 
free from “friends” who think cas­
ual drug use hurts no one. Peer 
pressure spreads drug use and 
peer pressure can help stop it.
You can help stop it ¦— if you get 
involved.

non and during the Syrian inter­
vention that same year and the 
Israeli invasion in 1982, the lead­
ership in Moscow refused to re­
supply the Syrian armed forces 
with military essentials. Far from 
aiding and abetting Assad, the 
Gorbachev leadership has made 
clear its distaste for Syrian in­
volvement. .
Mr. Schwartz contends that “the 
Soviets have too much at stake so 
the fighting won’t stop” but ne­
glects to tell us what that stake is.
I, for one, am at a complete loss to 
explain what he means when he 
writes of “deeply entrenched po­
litical ideals coming from, you 
guessed it, Moscow.” To equate 
any Soviet interest in the politi­
cal stability of a country barely a 
few hundred miles away from its 
southern frontier with the causes 
of the Lebanese conflict and its 
continuation is to miss the point 
entirely.
If one seeks responsibility for 
the current conflict in Lebanon
Letter to the Editor
on outside forces, Mr. Schwartz 
might do well to look at the 
American administration of which 
Ms. Kirkpatrick was a part. Faced 
with the possibility of an Israeli 
invasion of Lebanon in 1982, the 
Reagan administration did not 
move to forestall it and voiced its 
private encouragement. Then, 
instead of attempting to negoti­
ate even an interim political set­
tlement to the Lebanese situation 
through international or regional 
auspices, Washington placed an 
American military contingent 
directly into the fray. That move, 
to Mr. Schwartz, may have been 
an example of action by “someone 
[whol does have the courage to 
stand tall” but, resulting as it did 
in the death of over two hundred 
United States Marines, was a 
tragedy and an unmitigated dip­
lomatic disaster.
Mr. Schwartz does urge action 
and he states that “if the major
powers were to forcefully bring 
the warring factions to the bar­
gaining table, the fighting might 
stop.” Precisely how they would 
do so is left unclear. If Mr. 
Schwartz wants a truly independ­
ent Lebanon and an end to out­
side intervention (Syrian or 
other), an externally imposed set­
tlement is entirely the opposite of 
what he is evidently hoping for— 
an independent Lebanon that 
makes its own decisions about its 
political future.
If Mr. Schwartz really wants to 
make a meaningful contribution 
to the problem of a Lebanon 
wracked by internal feuds and 
the potential of a regional confla­
gration resulting from that situ­
ation, he had best look at the 
political circumstances there in 
all their complexity and offer some
specific solutions as to how to 
resolve the conflict. If the situ­
ation were as clear and as simple 
as he implies, the Lebanese con­
flict might never have reached 
this stage. Until he does, blaming 
“Syria and its militant subservi­
ents in Beirut,” the Soviet Union, 
the “Democrats and their liberal 
ilk,” and the “liberal majority in 
the legislative branch of our gov­
ernment” not only confuses the 
issues at hand but postpones an 
informed assessment of the prob­
lem as well as realistic efforts 
towards a resolution of the con­
flict in Lebanon.

in her third paragraph, she re­
fers to Carnegie Mellon as a 
college, not a university. I’m 
not about to criticize Blaire for 
her error in semantics, since I 
often refer to CMU as a school 
myself; however, I will criticize 
her for not living up to the stan­
dards she sets for others.
Blaire’s next diatribe is in de­
fense of Chatham’s academic 
integrity due to Stew’s remark 
about Chatham being "... not 
much of a school.” She first in­
flicts upon the readers a 500 
word excerpt from the Chatham 
College Catalogue, which lists 
what is supposed to be an im­
pressive array of courses offered 
to students, but it prefaces that 
list by stating that they were 
taught “...in that short period 
in the 1870’s when it also of­
fered post-graduate work.” 
What are you saying, Blaire, 
that Chatham College did pro­
vide a good education over 110 
years ago? The excerpt also 
states that “... the present cur­
riculum would be nearly unrec­
ognizable to the college’s found­
ing fathers.” (It further claims 
a Chatham education is compa­
rable to that at “... colleges of 
the first class,” seemingly im­
plying Chatham is less than 
first class.) I wonder if Blaire 
could tell me whose side this 
supports, hers or Stew’s.
Next, Blaire mentionsher ten­
dency to be found working in 
the Baker 140 cluster on Friday 
and Saturday nights as a rebut­
tal to Stew’s claim that he never 
sees Chatham students except 
for Friday and Saturday nights. 
This is a novel way of arguing 
isn’t it? (You’re wrong because 
you’re right.) Of course we all 
realize that Stew is simply 
implying that many Chatham 
students attend CMU frater­
nity parties. It is clear that
Blaire doesn’t even understand 
Stew’s intent.
Now we arrive at the most se­
rious of Blaire’s errors. She-^- 
claims Stew’s column “... insinu-; 
ates that women are just toys to^ 
be bought, played with, picked'.' 
up, manipulated, and thrown' 
away.” This exhibits a lack of 
contact with reality as well as 
an unusual and extreme hatred 
of men. I don’t mean to say that 
no man holds this attitude 
(known as frat-boy mentality), 
as some men certainly do. 
However, if Blaire’s intelligence^ 
quotient is greater than her* 
GPA, she wouldrealizethatthe 
toys referred to are not women,,
I honestly don’t understand how ' 
any rational person could so ¦ 
completely misconstrue Stew’s'" 
meaning; therefore, I submit 
that Blaire has an unnatural 
hatred of men and then creates" 
the justification for this disor­
der in her own mind.
Finally, I’d like to let Blaire- 
know that speaking as an intel- • • 
ligent, responsible former 
member of the Chatham com-." 
munity rather than as a bitter, '¦ 
resentful man-hater, I find your' 
letter to be unacceptable in" 
today’s society. Humankind will' 
not tolerate an outdated, anti-... 
quated “I hate all men because 
some people repress other 
people” mentality. I certainly 1 
hope that Blaire’s illogical, un"’ 
grammatical, misleading letter' 
is not indicative of the overall; 
quality of education received at~ 
Chatham. If not, I suggest she ' 
get some help for her obvious", 
emotional problems and spend1 
more time studying and paying- 
attention in class and less time” 
writing unfounded attacks off" 
any individual with a penis who 
happens to cross her path.

Politics is a dirty game.
Name-calling, mudslinging, 
and negative campaigning are all 
problems we now see. Even on 
this apolitical campus, I see the 
signs of political war, not over the 
divisive Dinkins-Koch primary in 
New York, or the Pittsburgh 
mayoral race, but the fight be­
tween Dan Cohen and Maiy Eliza­
beth Hunt for City Council.
Go figure—on a campus which 
doesn’t get worked up over $103 
million in Defense Department- 
sponsored research, signs are 
posted everywhere for people to 
vote in the Cohen-Hunt election. 
All of a sudden, the campus is a 
hotbed for Pittsburgh politics. 
Strange times, indeed.
Typically, I use the “bother 
factor” to choose my candidates in 
Pittsburgh elections. Which ever 
candidate bothers me less by 
sending me less mail wins my 
vote. Maybe that’s why I voted for 
Dukakis and Murphy.
The bother factor has one flaw 
¦—the person who bothers me less 
spends less, and likely loses. 
Therefore, I usually don’t do well 
in the elections, and must be 
content with saying“I told you so” 
six months later.
What’s amazing about all of this 
campaigning is the level of so­
phistication we’re seeing. The 
arguments in the letters to the 
editors and posters are so well- 
phrased and articulate, it’s un­
canny; it’s as if they were written 
by writing mEgors. Even the voter 
registration tables are staffed by 
writingmajors; it makes no sense.
Could it be that writing majors
have all that free time on their 
hands that they can become colle- 
giate Lee Atwaters for a month 
and a half? If so, why can’t they do 
something useful, like manage 
candidates to unseat Jesse Helms 
next year?
In reality, all of this campaign­
ing is classwork. Students are 
running the campus campaigns 
of the two candidates, and are 
being graded. This could mean 
that all of the people working on 
Cohen side fail if Hunt wins in a 
landslide. Worse yet, if the elec­
tion is contested, everyone in the 
class may getan incomplete pend­
ing who takes the council seat.
For the rest of us, it will simply 
mean longer lines for computers 
at the clusters. You and I will be 
trying to print our programs and 
papers, but be forced to wait for 
the latest posters and letters to 
The Tartan and the Student Un­
ion.
It may be a sound tactic for 
Hunt supporters to print lots of 
Cohen posters in Hunt Library 
and Margaret Morison Plaza. I’d 
never vote for Cohen if I had to 
hand in a paper late because I 
was waiting for 50 “Cohen for 
Council” posters to print from the 
queue.
Fortunately, Election Day is 
only one month away. Until then, 
we should remember that the 
eighth district has only about
35,000 people. If we wanted, 6000 
students could all write in Dick 
Cyertfor Council, and he’d proba­
bly win. After all, next year he’ll 
need a new job anyway.
Stew Levine is a second year 
master’s candidate in GSIA. He 
plans on voting for Harold Stas- 
sen, again.

Who do you 
bet on in ’89?
The mayor of Oakland Cali­
fornia recently phoned the 
mayor of San Francisco and 
tried to make a bet on the 
outcome of the World Series.
The San Francisco mayor 
¡hought such a bet would be 
¿seless because there wasn’t 
anything in Oakland he wanted. 
This sums up the overall 
jpinion of the ’89 Series. This 
Series has little to offer.
I am in no way trying to 
jelittle the significance of the 
World Series. As sporting 
events go, it is the most impor- 
;ant contest in existence. But 
¡his year, people many people 
ust don’t seem to care. Who 
Should we root for?
Deciding this question was 
easy during the League Cham­
pionship Series (I will not refer 
to them as the LCS since I am 
•eally beginning to hate acro­
nyms). Anybody with any sense 
of baseball history or simply a 
sense of justice pulled for the 
Cubs. They are, unofficially, 
America’s team, because they 
are perennially the underdogs.
This country loves two types: 
the big, strong and unbeatable 
Rambo types, and the strug­
gling, ever trying but never 
succeeding Chicago Cub types. 
We like the underdogs because 
[we like to think that we are 
compassionate people.
On the other hand, there is 
th&t type of person who revels 
in kicking the puppy from 
behind when he’s trying to grab 
a scrap of food off the sidewalk. 
Tie Mets are a great team, but 
;heir fans are a bit tough to the 
tpmach at times. The same 
lolds true for the Yankees and 
heir crew. New York is a 
ronderful place but there is 
lore to life than Shea Stadium, 
he Brooklyn Bridge, and 
reorge Stienbrenner, by God!
I; clieered for the Mets back in 
S6, mot because I was from New 
ork and felt it an obligation, 
ut ipecause they proved them- 
ilvjes to be the best team in 
as/eball, at the time.
Iput, as a Cubs fan, I think of 
iyself as more than just a base- 
all fan. I like to think that I 
m; a compassionate soul. That 
8 Why this year’s Series is so 
epressing.
The Cubs were so close. They 
iad one of the best records in 
aseball but just could not keep 
p;with the Giant bats.
The whole country cheered for 
aem (with the exception of the 
Hants’ fans and those “puppy 
ickers” described earlier). Cubs 
ins forgot all about the trav- 
sty of lights in Wrigley Field; 
ley had purpose once again. 
Sportscasters read with rever­
se and sorrow the outcome of 
npe 5 of the National League 
eiies. For most fans, the 
!ason ended on that day.
I mean, even in a New York 
U&way Series, there is a 
!rtain history and a classic 
yalry involved that will 
itrigue the rest of the country. 
ut in this year’s Bay City 
^es, all I can envision is San 
rancisco fans throwing lemon 
nds from their espresso cups 
&e Oakland fans. And if 
^ry Manilow sings the Na- 
°nal Anthem at Candlestick 
lr,k> I’m moving to Puerto Rico 
^re they know how to play
aseball.
I &ust admit that I will be 
illing for the Giants this 
*nes. I cannot, with clear 
^science, support any team

This Tartan runner needs four Hiram Terriers to bring him down. The Tartan ground game leads 
the PAC In total yardage.
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Managing Editor
There once was a football team at 
Carnegie Mellon. When it was good, it 
was very, very good. When it was bad, it 
was horrid.
The Tartans were indeed very, very 
good for Homecoming against Hiram 
College. The team presented the visiting 
alumni with the gift of a 48-6 pum­
melling of the hapless Terriers.
The week before, though, it was horrid, 
falling to the top ranked team in the 
East, Union College, 28-6. The Tartans 
are now 4-2,2-0 in the President’s Ath­
letic Conference.
How good were the Tartans against 
Hiram? Good enough for 460 total yards 
against Hiram’s 154. Good enough for 28 
first downs to Hiram’s eight. Good enough 
for junior Scott Bamyak to outrush the 
Terriers. Good enough to have six people 
play quarterback.
How bad were the Tartans against 
Union? Bad enough to fumble the ball 
three times on the first play from scrim­
mage. Bad enough to not be able to score 
from first and goal on the three. Bad 
enough to have the defense on the field 
for almost 39 minutes.
The win was against the Terriers acted 
as a balm after the Tartans’ first thrash­
ing of the season.
“We really need that [win] big time. 
We just came off the ball and beat ‘em. 
It was just a matter of pride after last 
week,” said senior guard Russ Hann.
Tartan Coach Rich Lackner was 
equally pleased with his team’s per­
formance. “That was as good a perform­
ance by a Carnegie Mellon football team 
in my 14 years here,” said Coach Lack­
ner. The 42 point win was Carnegie 
Mellon’s biggest since a 49-7 victory 
over Thiel College in 1982.
It took less than three minutes for the 
Tartans to do all of the scoring they 
would need against Hiram. Halfback 
Robert Schmitt fielded the opening 
kickoff and scooted up the left sideline 
before being forced out of bounds at the 
Hiram 42.
Six plays later, Fran Bellante found a 
hole on the right side of the line and had 
himself a 20-yard touchdown run, and 
the Tartans had a 7-0 lead.
After a brief respite through the rest 
of the first quarter, Carnegie Mellon 
put the game away in the second. Four 
drives equalled four touchdowns in the 
team’s best quarter of the season.
The first touchdown came fifteen 
seconds into the quarter with Barnyak 
carrying the ball in for the first of his 
three touchdowns of the game. The 
second, on the Tartans’ next play, was a

The Carnegie Mellon soccer team’s season reached a 
pivotal point as the Tartans faced Washington Univer­
sity and University of Rochester, two of the top three 
University Athletic Association’s teams. Amatch against 
Pitt helped to add even more drama to the schedule. 
However, the results weren’t much to the Tartans’ liking 
as they went 1-2-1, putting them dangerously close to a 
spot in the UAA basement.
The latest setback came on Saturday as the Tartans 
faced the Bears of Washington University and lost 3-2. 
The Bears came in ranked third in the UAA behind all­
conference players Paul Wright and Andy Sterioff, and 
two-time All-American goalkeeper Chris Scaglione. The 
Tartans played well but couldn!t muster enough offense 
and lost, 3-2.
The game started slowly, with both teams getting 
some opportunities but unable to capitalize on anything. 
However, at the 27:17 mark of the first half, Wright 
scored; ten minutes later, the Tartans’ Eddie Park scored 
to tie the game.
Unfortunately, the goal would be the last good thing to 
happen for quite some time. Less than a minute after 
Park’s score, Washington’s Chris Wollmuth scored to 
give the lead back to the Bears. Then the Tartans 
suffered a bigger setback when starter Young Kang had
to leave the game with a knee injury. Kang’s replace­
ment, Doug Jotzke, played very well, but it remains to be 
seen whether the injury will be a problem in future 
games.
The first half ended with Washington ahead 2-1, but
Paul Wright scored his second goal of the game early in 
the second half to put the Tartans in a deep hole. The 
Tartans seemed unable to get any offense going in the 
second half, until John Stivoric scored with less than 20 
minutes to play. The goal fueled the offense, but the 
Tartans ran out of time even as they were setting up for 
a possible tying comer kick.
Although the loss at Washington University had 
more significance in the standings, the Tartans’ 2-2 tie 
against the University of Pittsburgh may have actually 
been more of a disappointment to the team. The tie was 
frustrating, not only because of the crosstown rivalry, 
but also because of the number of good chances to win 
that the Tartans had throughout the game.
The Tartans seemed to be the stronger team in the 
early minutes, and they took a step toward proving it 
about 15 minutes into the game. The Tartans’ J.R. 
Yakubisin took a pass from Steve Gardner and blasted 
the ball past Pitt goalkeeper Jay Kapusta to give the 
Tartans a 1-0 lead. Soon after, tempers on both sides 
flared when CMU midfielder Alan Horn received a 
cheap shot from an unnamed Pitt player. Order was 
soon restored and play resumed; however, with fewer 
than ten minutes left, the Panthers’ Huy Tran scored, 
and the first half ended with the game knotted at one 
goal apiece.
The second half went quietly until Pitt scored again

Volleyball has ups and downs on the road, at home
By ALIM RAY

It was an action-packed week 
filled with upsets for the women’s 
volleyball team, as it took to the 
road and hosted at home.
Starting off the Tartans’ hectic 
schedule was the UAA tournament 
at the University of Chicago on 
October 6 and 7. This round robin 
tournament was held to seed the 
teams in the UAA Championships 
which will be in Rochester on 
October 27 and 28. The outcome
of the tourney put Carnegie 
Mellon in a three way tie for 
third with New York University 
and Brandeis University.
The next regular season match 
was played against Grove City 
last Tuesday, and kicked off the 
second half of the season for the 
Tartans. In a disappointing 
chain of events, CMU lost in 
five games to Grove City, 6-15, 
0-15,15-8,16-14, 5-15.
Two days later, Carnegie 
Mellon hosted Bethany College 
and California University of
Pennsylvania. Carnegie Mellon 
defeated Bethany in three out of 
three games, but lost to 
California University in two out 
of three.
The first game of the Bethany 
match consisted of two point 
drives. Bethany took the early 
lead, but Carnegie Mellon 
claimed the serve to make its 
own point rally. The Tartans 
pushed the score up to 13—7 with 
some exchanges of serve in 
between. Bethany won the serve 
back and attempted to make a
comeback in the game, but to no 
avail; CMU won the first game
15-9.
The Tartans won a few quick 
points in the second game but it 
eventually found themselves 
down 6-12 and calling time out. 
Carnegie Mellon managed a few 
points to bring it to a 13—12 lead 
but could not win the two re­
maining points needed and lost
16-14. In the deciding game, 
CMU again started out with the

The last two meets for the men’s 
cross-country team yielded unusual 
results. It expected to win the St. 
Vincent Invitational Saturday, and 
it expected Allegheny Nike to provide 
it with stiff competition the week 
before; however, just the opposite 
happened.
The Tartans beat Allegheny Nike, 
stretching their winning streak to 
104 consecutive dual-meet wins. But 
they came in second behind Slippery 
Rock University at the invitational. 
Since this was just an invitational 
meet it does not count toward the 
regular dual-meets and the team’s 
record still stands.
On a rainy October 6 at Schenley 
Park, the Tartans ran their last dual­
meet of the season against Allegheny 
Nike. They were surprised that their 
opponents were not as tough as they
had expected. All-American runner Dave 
Supp was especially counting on compe­
tition since he was going for the course 
record, which he missed by 13 seconds.
The runners claim that it is difficult to 
go for a record without someone to run 
against and provide competition. Refer­
ring to Supp’s effort to go for the record, 
junior Gary Harrison said, “It’s the best 
anyone could do on their own.”
Supp ran the fastest time of his life 
trying to beat the women’s coach Dario 
Donatelli’s nine-year-long record of 
24:57. Supp won the race in 25:10, 
approximately 30 seconds ahead of the 
next runner, from Allegheny Nike. Supp 
said, “ I thought the Nike runners would 
have been right up there with me, but I 
didn’t see another uniform once the gun 
went off. I never expected to win.”
The race was scheduled to begin at 
6:15 pm Friday night, but it started 
early to avoid the worsening weather 
conditions. Usually rain slows down a 
race because the runners are more con­
scious of the wet terrain, but this race 
didn’t seem to slow down for the 
weather.
Harrison, who loves to run in the 
rain, was skeptical of the conditions 
since he knew Supp was going for the 
record. He said, “I usually love this, 
but I wished it wouldn’t have rained 
today.”
After Allegheny’s first runner, 
behind Supp came seven Carnegie 
Mellon p runners, many of whom ran 
a personal best. Leading the pack 
was co-captain Len O’Neal who tvas 
pleased with his race. Said O’Neal, 
“It’s about time Supp and I were 
number one and two again.”
O’Neal had a personal record as he 
came in second for the team and third 
overall in 25:59. Behind O’Neal, also 
running a fast race, were teammates 
sophomore Jon Frieder in 26:03, 
junior Harrison in 26:13, sophomore 
Mike Damon in 26:15, and senior

39-yard pass from Billy Snyder to Mike Beresford 
which extended the lead to 21-O.Two more touch­
downs were added with an 18-yard pass from Snyder 
to Dean Garofola and Bamyak’s second touch­
down, a 10-yard run.
Carnegie Mellon added two more scores in the 
second half: another 10-yard touchdown run by 
Bamyak and a 12-yard run by Greg Marmol.
Hiram avoided the shutout by scoring on a half­
back option pass from Jerome Starks to Josh Allen 
with 43 seconds remaining in the game.
• One week earlier, the story was the same but the 
roles were reversed. The mistakes were made by 
the Tartans, and the points were scored by Union’s 
Dutchmen.
Just as the Tartans only needed three minutes to 
get score against Hiram, Union only needed two 
and a half to score against Carnegie Mellon. On 
CMU’s first play of the game, Snyder lost control of 
the snap. It was recovered by Union’s Greg Hallas. 
Six plays later, Union’s leading rusher Ryan Mason 
ran the ball up the middle for a touchdown and a 
6-0 Dutchman lead.
Union’s next drive put the game away. Mason 
found an opening on the left side of the field, 
carrying the ball 42 yards down to the CMU12 yard 
line. Four plays later Tom Lombardoni punched it 
home and Union had a 12-0 lead.
The Dutchmen added two more scores in the 
second quarter. The first, a six-yard option pass 
from halfback Jerald Walker to quarterback Brett 
Russ, was set up by another first-play fumble, this 
one by Bamyak. The second, on a pass from Russ to 
Mason, gave Union a 25—0 lead.
The Tartans put together one scoring threat late 
in the first half. Snyder found Garofola open in the 
middle, and was rewarded with a 40-yard pass, 
setting up first and goal at the two. However, on 
fourth and three, Bamyak was stopped just short of 
the goal line and Union ran out the half.

Despite losses, the women’s field 
hockey team has put forth a strong 
effort against recent opponents. 
Carnegie Mellon pushed Bethany 
into overtime Wednesday, but 
Bethany still managed a 2-1 win 
over CMU.
Although the loss was heart­
breaking, the Lady Tartans gave
a strong performance against 
Bethany, who is ranked ninth in 
the division. “I think we played 
an awesome game—much better 
than last year,” said player Den­
ise Heisey. “We really held them 
off.”
John Hopkins served Carnegie 
Mellon a defeat on Friday in its 
tournament game, with a final 
score of 7-1. This was the Lady 
Tartans’ first game on astroturf,
which led to some difficulties in 
the first half, when John Hopkins 
scored all of its seven goals. In the 
second half, CMU found some new 
strength and held off its opponent 
with a goal scored by Becky Pow­
ers on an assist by Kim Kalista.
Saturday, the Lady Tartans 
suffered another defeat, this time 
from University of Rochester, who

On the road again — waiting for the completion of the field
AsrUdib b1eshFmg 1C trs(FDiF vFnn1( vrDr"i(F
By ANIL GHOKAUE
Tàrtan Staffwriter
- -A home field, the spot where the college community can gather to 
support its team, has been absent at CMU for the past two years. Not 
that we are a Michigan or Notre Dame where packed stadiums reach 
into the seventy-thousands, but just having a place where people can 
escape the everyday doldrums of life, either to view a game or 
participate in sports, is a basic element of the college experience. 
°The much anticipated arena with its artificial turf will finally be 
c&fripleted next year, but the wait and not having a stadium to call our 
own has taken its toll.
-*i)n the varsity level, Nick Gaudioso, the men’s head soccer coach, 
stated that not having a home field is like playing on the road all the 
time.
There are many disadvantages to this situation. Among the more 
obvious difficulties is finding an area to practice. To make it more 
difficult, the area must be close to campus.
.„Unfortunately for the soccer team, over an hour is spent round trip
to the practice field in Sewickley. Practice generally lasts for two 
hours, but with the wasted hour in travel, the practice is reduced to 
one hour.
The track team suffers, as well. Its practice is reduced to a minuscle 
fifteen minutes. Another problem is that to reach the field on time, 
players must skip classes that they normally wouldn’t have if there 
were a home field. Also, by the time the team returns from practice, 
about the only meal available is the Tartan Grill, and eating fast food 
five times a week is not overly appetizing.
The Cut has definitely felt the wrath of cleats from the football 
team. This area, mainly used to throw frisbees, is now a tortured, 
dirty, brown mudhole, diminishing the beauty of the campus. The 
football team is lucky because its practice field is close, but its home 
games are played in Mt. Lebanon.
One problem is that for home games, the players can’t sleep in that 
extra hour and a half due to the extra time in travel, according to 
Tartan guard Josh Anthony. Greg White, a linebacker, succintly 
stated that this predicament is “a pain in the ass.”
Scheduling these home games is no easy task. First of all, a certifi­
cate of insurance has to be sent to business managers of their respec­
tive fields. Second, transportation 
has to be organized. Renting the 
field itself is a hassle, since con­
flicts arise with others who re­
serve the grounds as well. Rental 
fees and availability of the neces­
sary equipment, such as lockers 
and scoreboards, are other con­
siderations.
With such problems, compet­
ing teams are less likely to come, 
resulting in a reduction in the 
number of home games. For ex­
ample, the soccer team would nor­
mally play half of its games at 
home; last year only six of the 17 
total games were on the interim 
field.
A lack of a home field can have negative effects on the athletes. An 
attitude detected by Gary Meckley, head men’s track and field coach, 
was one of, “Coach, how do you expect me to do well when we don’t 
even have a track?” As he stated, the “silk purse with sow’s ear” 
concept applies here, where it’s hard to motivate the players when 
what they are saying is true.
In reference to IM sports, touch football and soccer have not been 
affected. But softball, the sport with the largest number of partici­
pants, has been devastated, to the degree of being cancelled last year 
since no fields were available. “The city of Pittsburgh was gracious to 
allow us to use Flagstaff Hill as a field,” noted E.J. Birdy, director of 
intramurals, “but when it came to baseball, the Little Leagues had 
first priority.”
Club sports seemed to be least affected of all the levels. Overall, 
players have ‘expressed the feeling of sacrifice now, benefit later — 
the benefits being not only the stadium itself, but the support of the 
crowds who right now are unwilling to travel long distances to the 
games.
Birdy said of the new field, “It’s like building a house. You suffer 
many inconveniences,” but the final product is a new athletic field.
The new athletic facilities, still under construction are scheduled to be ready for next season

Going into the President’s Ath­
letic Conference championship 
tournament, the women’s tennis 
team wanted to place at least 
second, and predicted that Grove 
City would be the only thing in its 
way.
The Lady Tartans’ predictions 
were correct. Grove City chalked 
k up its third consecutive PAC 
championship Thursday and Fri­
day, and its fourth in the last five 
years. CMU’s eight points were 
second to Grove City’s. 15. Wash­
ington and Jefferson finished in 
third with four points, and Thiel 
placed fourth with no points.
Carnegie Mellon snagged sec­
ond place with wins in the finals 
in number two singles and num­
ber one doubles.
In number two singles, Beth 
Cavanaugh defeated Kris Mar- 
ton of Grove City 7-5,7—6, wining 
the tie breaker in the second set 
7—3. This match marks 
Cavanaugh’s third consecutive 
year as the PAC number two 
doubles champion. Cavanaugh 
then joined with Mary Beth Ash- 
baugh in number one doubles to
“It didn’t measure our ability as a 
team very well. We needed to win all 
of our matches."
— Laura Ahr
defeat Grove City’s Debon Kaims 
and Marton 4—6, 6-2, 6-2. Al­
though she has played with dif­
ferent partners, Cavanaugh has 
been part of CMU’s past three 
number one doubles teams to be 
champions.
The Lady Tartans did not have
as much luck in their other 
matches. Ashbaughlost to Kaims 
6-2,6-1 in the number one singles 
slot.
Laura Ahr, although taking the 
first set against Grove City’s 
Karen Scibetta 4-6, was not able 
to hold on in the next sets, losing
6—3, 6—1 in the number four 
singles position. CMU did not 
place anyone in the finals matches 
of numbers three, five and six 
singles.
Ahr and Alice Garber at num­
ber two, won the middle set 5—7, 
but lost the first and third sets
6-2, 6-2 to Scibetta and Caren 
Hiser of Grove City. In number 
three doubles, CMU’s Lia Calhoun 
and Abigail, Ochberglost 6-2,6-1.
The team was disappointed to a 
degree in the outcome of the tour­
nament. “It didn’t measure our 
ability as a team very well,” said 
Ahr.
There was a question of fair­
ness also, as Grove City started 
the tournament with five points, 
due to byes. “It (winning) could 
have been done, but we had bad 
odds,” said Ahr.
It was not inconceivable that 
the Lady Tartans could have 
pulled off first place. “It was pos­
sible for us to win,” said Ahr. “We 
needed to win all of our matches.” 
Ochberg believes the team played 
well, although a perfect perform­
ance was required to win. She 
was still happy with the outcome, 
as the team only expected third or 
fourth place.

Pumping iron is one way to turn the flab into a healthy, sculptured body
By SHEILA SKAFF
Tartan Staffwriter
In any explanation of anaerobic 
exercise - that is exercise which 
does not require an excess of 
oxygen use, weightlifting tops the 
list of examples. For anyone who 
wants to build a better body, 
weightlifting has the advantage 
that participants can sculpt their
own bodies.
Being able to sculpt your body 
doesn’t mean that if you lift 
weights you will automatically 
look like Arnold Schwartzeneger. 
Nor does it mean you want to. 
There are many reasons to lift 
weights. Some people lift weights 
for sport, others compete in shows 
for profit, and still others just 
want to tone and build to look 
better and feel stronger. What­
ever the reason, there are some 
basic things to know before ever 
picking up a barbell.
According to Bodybuilding: the 
Weider Approach, by bodybuilder 
Joe Weider, the amount of time 
spent in the gym is an important 
element in performance. Abegin- 
ner should lift three nonconsecu- 
tive days per week, at the same 
time each day for 30 to 45 min­
utes each time. Any more time 
can cause boredom or overused 
muscles, and any less won’t give
good results.
No more than one minute should 
go by between sets of lifts; longer 
will allow muscles to cool off and 
increase the risk of injury. To 
prevent boredom, Weider sug­
gests that workout programs 
should be switched every four to 
six weeks.
Weider recommends that 
weightlifters set both major and 
minor goals. For example, if your 
arm is 16 inches in circumfer­
ence, and your major goal is to 
increaseitto 18 inches, first try to 
get to 16.5 inches, then to 17 
inches, and so on until it becomes 
18 inches. Keeping records lets 
you see how far you’ve come and 
can be inspiration to keep trying. 
Weidner also recommends not 
overdeveloping one part of the 
body at first; all parts of the body 
should be developed evenly.
Precaution is an important 
aspect of weightlifting. Jeff
Housenbold of the Caber Club, 
CMU’s fitness club on Margaret 
Morrison Street, said that as a 
safety precaution, weightlifters 
should stretch before and after a 
workout. Weider backs up this 
point, saying that in order to 
prevent injuries, weightlifters 
should always wear collars and 
have a spotter present when lift­
ing.
People’s reasons for weightlift­
ing differ. In general, women lift 
to tone and men to build. Every­
one should generate a program 
which suits his or her needs. 
Lower weight combined with 
higher repetition helps to tone 
muscles, while a higher weight 
and lower repetition will build 
muscle.
It isn’t that difficult to figure 
out what is the best routine for 
yourself. Posters demonstrating 
how to exercise a specific area are 
usually scattered throughout
gyms. For example, the pector- 
alis major muscles are tightened 
by using a bench press, incline 
dumbbell press, or the bent-arm 
pullover. The squat and dead lift 
work on the gluteus maximus, 
while the power clean, front squat, 
and leg extension build the 
quatriceps.
There are a couple of options 
when it comes to weightlifting at 
CMU. The gym offers the use of 
its facilities, including free 
weights and universal machines, 
to students and faculty. The Caber 
Club offers these and Nautilus 
machines, but charges a fee. 
Working out at the Caber Club is 
excellent for a beginner since the 
employees are trained to answer 
questions and give insctructions 
on the equipment.
Approximately 40 people per 
day use the Caber Club. David 
Lawrence, the night manager, 
feels that being a part of a club is
important also for weightlifters; 
“Some people exercise better when 
there’s people around— theylget 
into the atmosphere,” he said.
When starting someone on 
basic weightlifting program, thj\ 
Caber Club designs a program of 
riding an exercise bike and 
stretching—two to three exercises 
for the lower body and three to 
four for the upper body. In consid- 
ering joining a gym, beginner 
should look for gyms which will 
define their present fitness levels 
and design programs to fit these 
needs.
The Caber Club is a good place 
to go for more information oi\ 
weightlifting, whether you’re jusf 
getting started or have lifted for 
years. For information on fitness 
in general, contact Donna Mo- 
rosky in the gymnasium offices.

CMU hockey disappointed at Slippery Rock
By KELLY STERLING
Tartan Staffwriter
Although it expected an easy 
game this past Saturday 
against Slippery Rock, the 
Carnegie Mellon hockey team 
returned quite dejected by the 
actual outcome. The team was 
defeated by a score of 9-3.
The first period “got off to a 
really bad start, ” according to 
Captain Mark Robson. Slip­
pery Rock scored three min­
utes into the game, which even­
tually sparked two other goals 
to give the Tartan’s a three 
goal lead in only five minutes 
of play. Finally at 8:33, CMU’s 
Ed Kilduff scored his 17th goal 
of the season. The period ended 
with the score 4-1.
The second period comprised 
the remainder of the scoring. 
Slippery Rock again scored 
quickly and put in three goals 
within the first few minutes. 
Accordingto Robson, “Those quick 
goals made us very shaky.”
This probably accounted for the 
many penalties issued against 
CMU during the period. Players 
Paul Martinchich and Jan-Marc 
Featherston each scored a goal 
for the Tartans this period. Two 
other goals by Slippery Rock 
pushed its total to nine.
The third period was played 
quite defensively resulting in no 
scoringby either team. The game 
finally ended with the score 9-3.
The CMU hockey team also 
played an exhibition game against 
Duquesne this past at the Civic
Arena. As Duquesne is the 
best college team in Pittsburgh, 
the Dukes handily defeated the 
Tartans 6-0.
Saturday’s game was rough, 
but Robson believes the Tar­
tans “played a lot better” the 
next day. The team was espe­
cially disappointed with the 
results of the weekend because 
the Tartans feel it is a much 
better team than Slippery 
Rock.
However, six key players 
were missing from the game 
for various reasons which 
caused some problems for the 
hockey team.
Next weekend, the hockey 
team takes on New York Uni­
versity on Saturday and John 
Carroll University on Sunday.
NJ Devils acquire valuable scorers
By MICHAEL D.C. DROUT
Tartan Staffwriter
There has been a fair amount of 
excitement in the hockey season 
so far. Even as Wayne Gretzky 
neared Gordy Howe’s all-time 
point total this week, it was 
rumored that Howe, 61, would 
return to the ice with the Hart­
ford Whalers for at least one game. 
Latest reports are that Howe will 
not be returning, but if he could 
play half as well as Guy Lafleur is 
playing for Quebec, he would be 
an asset to the Whalers.
After watching the Devils-Pen- 
guins game last Saturday, I have 
a few observations:
The Penguins move the puck 
out of their zone as well as any 
team in hockey only Los Angeles 
and Calgary are even close. They
set up well and the new big for­
wards are trying to get to the 
front of the net. However, it is 
still the Mario Lemieux show. 
When Lemieux is not on the ice 
Pittsburgh is unable to keep the 
puck out of its own zone, not giv­
ing Barasso, who has been play­
ing as well as the year in which he 
shared the Jennings Trophy, any 
breathing room whatsoever.
The Penguins take too many 
stupid, chippy penalties, espe­
cially Rob Brown, who doesn’t 
have as good a move to the net as 
he did last year. And Lemieux is 
cherry-picking all the time, hang­
ing on the blue line even when the 
puck stays in his own zone for 
minutes at a time. This may be 
Ubriaco’s game plan, but it very 
well may get the Penguins in 
trouble later in the season.
Elsewhere: The acquisitions? 
Sylvain Turgeon and Wall 
Podubny will likely have mori 
impact than the Russian players 
on the Devils. These two former 
misfits scored six goals between 
them (Turgeon had a hat trick ft 
game one) in New Jersey’s first 
two games and look to deliver 
some offensive production that 
was lacking last year.
Look for the league to make i 
decision on Philadelphia’s weag 
“trade” that enabled Keith Acton 
and Pete Peeters to avoid the 
waver draft. These two players 
may be put up on the block bv 
league officials.
And pending this, see wh^t 
Philadelphia does with Hextal. 
Rumors include a trade to Chi­
cago for Denis Savaard or to 
Winnipeg for Dale Hawerchuk.

with 17:51 remaining. Huy Tran 
beat Tartan goalie Glenn 
Hoogerwerf, who was trying to 
play through an injury received 
earlier when he blocked a hard 
breakaway shot by Tran. The 
Tartans stepped up the offen­
sive tempo after Tran’s second 
goal, and defenseman John 
Stivoric scored with less than 
eight minutes to close out the 
scoring. The teams battled for 
the remainder of regulation and
thirty minutes of overtime, but 
the game ended in a tie.
The best game of the last two 
weeks turned out to be last 
Saturday’s match against Grove 
City. The Tartans came from 
behind late in the game to win, 
3-2.
Abouthalfwaythroughthefirst 
half, the Tartans took a 1- 0 lead 
on a goal by John Stivoric. The 
goal was made more remarkable 
by the fact that, only a few min­
utes earlier, Stivoric had taken
an accidental shot to the head in 
a collision with a Grove City 
player. The Tartans’ lead was 
short-lived as Grove City’s Matt 
White scored the first of two goals 
to tie the score. After White’s goal, 
both teams stayed scoreless until 
the first half ended 1—1.
A few minutes into the second 
half, White stole a pass intended 
for Carnegie Mellon’s J.R. Yakub- 
isin and scored to make the score 
2-1, and Grove City’s defense 
seemed to tighten even further on
the Tartans. CMU was unable 
to get a scoring threat until, 
with about six minutes left, 
Young Kang scored to tie the 
game at two. Eddie Park scored 
with only 53 seconds on the 
clock to give the Tartans the 
victory.
In the only other action of the 
last two weeks, Carnegie Mel­
lon lost 2-1 in overtime against 
the University of Rochester, co­
leaders of the University Ath­
letic Association.

One of the Tartans top run­
ners, sophomore Russ Shorkey, 
took a second week off missing 
the Allegheny meet because of 
a pulled muscle, but returned 
for the St. Vincent Invitational 
Saturday.
CMU placed second at the in­
vitational behind Slippery Rock 
University, with a score of
15-71. Head coach Gary Meckley 
kept his four top runners Supp, 
O’Neal, Frieder, and Harrison out 
of the race since the Tartans 
usually win by such a large mar­
gin. However, Slippery Rock kept 
its best runners in the race and 
consequently won the meet with 
its top runners leading the pack.
Behind CMU was the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh’s team with 79 
points followed by another Car­
negie Mellon team with 98 points, 
California University of Pennsly- 
vania with 172 points, St. Vin­
cent College with 198 points and 
finally the Jeannette Harriers 
with 198 points.
The winner of the meet, from 
Slippery Rock ran the meet in 
27:22, followed by seven team­
mates. Following the pack from 
Slippery Rock was a runner form 
California University of Pennsly-
vania. The first Carnegie Mel­
lon runner to cross the line, . 
coming in ninth overall, was , 
senior Tim Berger at27:56. This . 
was the first time that the All- . 
Eastern runner placed first for 
the team.

doming back to Homecoming
changes in the 
Drama Department
CFA — DRAMA MAJOR — CLASS OF 1945
“I have not been back in forty-four years. I 
graduated in 1945 and I’m coming back because 
this is the 75th anniversary of the Drama De­
partment. When it began 75 years ago it was the 
first of it’s kind, it’s very famous, and that’s 
what made me come here, as an undergraduate 
originally. All the other drama departments 
that exist in other colleges and universities were 
inspired from this department here at CMU.
“To train as an actor, first of all you have to 
have talent. But the education that was pro­
vided for us here was in all phases of theater, 
technical aspects, construction, scene design, 
lighting, make-up, costume, in addition to, of 
course, to our training in acting and the practi­
cal application in performance. So when I went 
out, I was a well—rounded theater person.
"Last night I saw a cabaret production in the 
studio theater at 11:00 which was very enjoy­
able. It makes me happy to see that the students 
are still doing good quality work. What I would 
like to say to the students enrolled in the Drama 
department at this time would be, persist, that’s 
what you need to do, you need a great deal of 
persistence.... You have to have faith in yourself, 
and you need to continually work at what you

Alumni return to their alma mater with some memories
CIT — ELECTRICAL ENGINEER — 
CLASS OF 1948
“I am a member of Delta Upsilon, and 
when I was going to school we all thought of 
our fraternity as being very unique. We used
to cut off the tail of the panther on the 
Panther Hollow Bridge. And I’ve been told 
that it’s been going on ever since. It gets cut 
off and then it gets replaced.
Panty raids were just beginning when I
was going to school, too.”
And his wife adds, “If that’s still going on, 
I’d like to say to the girls victimized by this 
practice that Maidenform is having a 2-for- 
1 sale, if you want to replace underwear.”
Alumnus sees
A couple returns to CMU for
sentimental reasons
MARGARET MORRISON — FASHION DESIGN MAJOR — 
CLASS OF 1951
77 came back because of] sentimental memories. My husband . 
and I were married here. We had our reception at the old Beta 
Theta Pi House on Forbes Avenue. Being back here reminds us of 
how we fell in love with each other when we were young. It re­
kindles feelings.
“My teacher, Doris Meyers, was wonderful, but tough. Later I 
realized how good she was. You seem to realize only after your 
school is done how influential certain teachers have been to you.
'• "To the students I would say, enjoy what you do, and remember 
lyour friendships. The friendships that you develop now are going to
> be important to you later on. My roommate and I are still the 
¦closest of friends after all these years. These friendships hold a 
common experience that you’ve gone through together in your 
\formative years and you look back on that and it keeps you young 
':}n your heart.
\ “My husband and I are going around and looking at all the 
places we used to sit, like certain benches and the tree above the 
fFence.
1There’s a lot of good change but I am going to say something 
that you probably don’t want to hear. Margaret Morrison looks very 
run down, and it makes me sad to see it like that, and the frater­
nity house, if you’ve ever been to one of the fraternity houses. It 
[makes me ask, how can you live like this? It’s unbelievable...”

Homecoming? What does it 
mean? People come back for vari­
ous reasons, possibly to meet good 
friends from the past, or to take 
part once more in school spirit. 
They may do this because, in many 
ways, supporting your school can 
be like supporting or believing in 
yourself.
To the alumni, CMU is some­
thing which is a part of them, but 
much more than just who they 
are. Many return to CMU, but
many more do not, possibly be­
cause a journey back to an impor­
tant place in your past can be as 
dangerous as it is enriching. Those 
who do not return may fear the 
power thattheir memories oftheir 
past have over their lives today.
The past. It is something we 
look back upon with both a long­
ing to return and a desire to leave 
it behind. We may create narra­
tives about the old college days: I 
remember my dad sitting down 
and telling me about all the pranks 
he and his college buddies used to

Asians are by far the largest 
group of minorities on campus. 
Despite this fact, there are still 
some misunderstandings and 
many issues at question be­
tween and among Asian stu­
dents and other students. Focal 
Point was created in the hopes 
of dispelling misunderstand­
ings by organizing open forums 
of all students focusing onAsian 
issues.
Focal Point is an open forum 
of discussion that focuses on all 
issues dealing with Asians and 
Asia. It was started last year by 
Hajime Ando, a sophomore 
architectural major. He says 
he knows firsthandofthe prob­
lems often faced by foreign
Asian students. “I have lived in 
many different countries and I 
don’t personally feel that there 
are any racial differences, but I 
recognized various racial ten­
sions,” he says, “I started Focal 
Point in an effort to do something 
about them.”
Currently, racial tensions are 
mild. But with a growing Asian 
population, Carnegie Mellon, like 
other campuses, could experience 
hostility towards Asians. Focal 
Point addresses such issues in 
open discussions.
The discussions in the forum 
range from topics like potential 
hostility towards Asians to more 
personal events like interracial 
dating. They also try to confront 
problems that Asian students 
have. For Asian Americans, these 
problems may include dealing
with prejudices. For people for­
eign to the United States, these 
problems might be culture shock, 
alienation or difficulty with the 
language.
Another goal of the Focal Point 
is to help Asian students from 
other countries adjust to Ameri­
can culture. When students come 
from other countries, they some­
times lose their identity and be­
come very seclusive. Focal Point 
helps Asian students from Amer­
ica and abroad to find or retain 
their cultural identity, yet at the 
same time, become more active 
with the rest of the community.
The forum is quite different from 
the Asian Student Union. ASA is 
more of a special interest club 
interested in promoting campus 
events and cultural activities. The 
Focal Point is a discussion group
that is open to everyone. Although 
it is focused towards Asian is­
sues, it is not just for Asians. The 
group has no membership dues 
because its organizers felt that it 
should be a group that anyone 
could just walk into. Funding for 
the group comes from Student 
Affairs and private donations. 
Currently, Focal Point is trying 
to get names of lecturers from the 
East Coast Asian Student Union, 
to speak on various problems faced 
by Asians and how to deal with 
them. Future lecture topicB may 
include such things as the alleged 
Asian quota system in some uni­
versities and international issues 
facing Asian countries.
Brian Wu, a junior majoring in 
computer engineering and a 
member of the organizational 
committee, says, “We welcome
opinions from everyone. Focal 
Point is not just for Asians. It is 
for anyone interested in discuss­
ing topics related to Asian issues, 
both international and within the 
college community.
He also said that one of Focal 
Point’s main goals is to get rid of 
the concept of all Asians being 
alike. Each person has his or her 
own background. Though most 
Asians on campus come from the 
United States, some come from 
other countries like China, Ja­
pan, and Canada. Each has his 
or her own likes and dislikes. 
The forum wants to explore 
everyone’s individuality and en­
courage them to learn about their 
cultural heritage.
Most people, Asian and non- 
Asian, were not aware of any 
prejudices towards Asians. When
asked in a random poll, jj]J 
Denesvich, a freshman in CIT 
said, “I never really thought 
about it.” Most others felt the 
same.
Ando said, “It is true that 
most people are not aware of, 
any prejudices or tensions, but1 
we want to educate and inform; 
the community so that such ten-' 
sions don’t grow.
“Focal Point was created in 
an effort to educate the commu­
nity about Asia and Asian stu-1 
dents. We are trying to help' 
Asian students find their iden% 
tity and learn more about their 
cultures.”
If you are interested in one of 
the open discussions or if you 
would like to learn more about 
Asians, contact Focal Point at, 
the Skibo Information Desk.
Etiquette for outcasts: Matching 
your wine color with your dinner

Three members of the Kiltie Band are seen here performing for the alumni that returned to campus for 
Homecoming this year.Why do former students return 
to CMU for Homecoming?
b1(hi(eFM ,s1p UrDF N
play on numerous victims. Itcould 
be these memories that bring the 
alumni back.
Being a CMU graduate means 
that you are part of a select group. 
For this weekend, we can all come 
together as a big community with 
this great thing in common: that 
this campus in Pittsburgh has 
had, or will have, much to do with 
what we will become. By the time 
you read this, however, Home­
coming will already be over. I 
hope it was a time that the stu­
dents of CMU, both past and 
present, came together to share 
and enjoy. Homecoming is impor­
tant because it enables students 
at CMU to see for themselves
what is unique and different about 
coming here.
What is so different about Car­
negie Mellon? Well, I assume no 
other school has plaid as its school 
color, or paints a fence in the 
middle of campus to announce 
events. Or perhaps, oddest of all, 
is the fact that we have at our 
school so many very different 
disciplines studying alongside one 
another. The colleges have only 
one thing in common: each stu­
dent at every college is very dedi­
cated.
But college, for me, is all about 
missed opportunities. There’s so 
much going on that you’re bound 
to miss something really great. If 
you missed Homecoming hecause
of a problem set or a project, don’t 
feel guilty. On the other hand, if 
you missed Homecoming for a 
weekend TV marathon, you have 
my permission to feel guilty. 
Basically, what I’m saying is that 
it’s worth it to get involved if you 
can find the time. It can be com­
forting to see yourself in a long 
line of others, it’s an experience 
that makes you feel a part of 
something much bigger.
Perhaps this is why the alumni 
come back to feel the pressure 
again, to see if it’s all still here 
where they left it many years ago, 
hopingthat maybe others are still 
experiencing the same things that 
were unique to CMU when they 
went.

The following are excerpts from 
my new book, Etiquette For So­
cial Outcasts, due out in hard­
back, any time now. A movie deal 
is also being worked out.
The use of utensils
Many people make the choice of 
utensils far more difficult than it 
needs to be. They believe, as only 
the truly rude do, that there is a 
particular fork you use just for 
salads and a particular spoon to 
use with soups. This is just plain 
incorrect. The simple truth of the 
matter is that one should use the 
utensil which is the closest in size 
to the food which you are eating. 
This is why one carves an entire 
turkey with a carving knife, but 
one cuts a small serving of turkey 
with a smaller knife.
As far as soups are concerned, 
the matter of utensils is some­
what different. No matter what 
certain schools of etiquette may 
tell you, it is definitely not accept­
able to drink your soup directly 
from the bowl, as this practice 
often causes soup to be spilled on 
the tablecloth of your hostess. 
Instead, one should us.e a strawto 
suck up the soup, if it is a clear 
broth. If it has solid matter in it 
(that is vegetables, meat, noodles), 
they should be fished out with a 
fork or spoon and discreetly placed 
in a napkin. You may then treat 
the soup as if it were a broth. 
Little, if any, comment should be
made about this, because it is an 
indication that the hostess’ cook 
cannot properly prepare clear 
soups. To mention this at dinner 
would be very indelicate.
What wine to serve
Frequently, I hear the com­
plaint, “I don’t know what kind of 
wine to serve with what dish.” 
This is another problem with a 
simple solution. I’m sure most 
people are aware of the old ax­
iom: white wines with chicken 
and fish, red wines with red meat. 
This is just an expansion of the 
more general rule of etiquette: 
always serve a wine which most 
closely matches the color of the 
food which you are serving. For 
instance, roast beef in gravy 
would demand and rich brown 
wine, while a milky white claret 
would go well with a soufle. If 
vegetables are the main dish, then 
one should serve a green chablis. 
It is also acceptable, if there is no 
one primary color to your meal, to
serve a wine which best matches 
your tablecloth, like a good, vin­
tage, checkered burgundy. In tin! 
case, it is also acceptable to serve 
stronger beverages with dinner. 
For example, the clever hostess? 
while using her tartan tablecloth, 
would serve plaid Scotch.
Weapons
It is rarely socially correct li, 
produce firearms at a dinner 
party. Under absolutely no cir­
cumstances is it acceptable; 
though, to shoot your host or 
hostess, no matter how bad thè 
food was.
If you want to express your 
displeasure at a meal, go upio 
your host or hostess and say 
something like, “Muffy, I simpl^ 
must tell you that was the mi 
sickening meal I have ever eaten,
I think I shall [remember, proper 
grammar is important] be ill,” arid 
then slip a cyanide capsule info 
her drink. Or say, “Thad, old man. 
I’ve never had a more horrendous 
dinner in my life,” and then tate 
him out back and beat him up. So 
while firearms are discourage^ 
from the place of dining, it i 
acceptable to perform a violent 
act upon the host once you take 
him or her aside and away from 
the table.
In closing, remember, there is a 
right way of doing things and a 
wrong way, and that’s what disi 
tinguishes the truly well bred from 
the peasants. .5

: Editor’s note: This column is 
I written by four people who want 
( to be referred to as The Satanic 
ii Pizza Tasters. For this reason they 
I will remain anonymous.
I For many college students pizza 
i is a way of life. I would venture to 
;; guess that more money on cam- 
^pus is spent on pizza than for any 
other delivered food. It is rela­
tively inexpensive, quick and 
| testes damn good.
’Some entrepreneurial souls 
i'liave taken notice and have 
iw started up pizza stores to cater to 
¡T-the insatiable appetites of stu­
dents in the local area. It is our 
goal to separate the wheat from 
the chaff; to give you, the student, 
an idea of which pizza is, in our 
hopefully objective view, the best 
if in town. We will only be consider- 
. Ing pizza which is delivered to 
your abode, be it dorm room, 
apartment, cluster, or penthouse 
suite.
‘“Two pizzas willbe reviewed each 
* week; one standard large thin pep- 
' peroni and one of the manager’s 
choice. We hope to have a “lowest 
common denominator” and a “best 
effort.” The reviews will be bro­
ken down into two basic sections: 
,i the objective ratings based on 
scales from zero to ten and a prose 
analysis giving our overall im­
pressions of the pizza. The cate­
gories for the numerical ratings 
are cheese, sauce, crust, visual 
^aesthetics, quality and quantity 
of toppings, overall quality and, 
finally, as a judge of the pizza’s 
worth, overall value for money.
This week we received pizza
from Domino’s. The “best effort” 
consisted of sausage, pepperoni, 
mushrooms, green pepper, and 
onions. After a comprehensive, 
cautious, and rigorous culinary 
examination of both pizzas, fol­
lowed by long, sweat-drenched 
hours of painstaking soul-search­
ing and deliberation by our ex­
pertly trained and fully experi­
enced panel, we all agreed on one 
very solid, fundamental and ines­
capable position: “Pretty Good.” 
To summarize, there were no sig­
nificant strengths or weaknesses.
First we will list the points we 
found lacking. The crust was gen­
erally boring and a little doughy. 
On the “best effort” pizza, we found 
that the sauce was lacking in 
quantity; the toppings tended to 
hide its flavor. We noticed that 
the pizzas were not as hot as we 
would have liked or expected; 
particularly in light of Domino’s 
alleged commitment to avoiding 
the “Noid.”
On the positive side and much 
more noteworthy was the overall 
quality of the pizza. The toppings 
were all of the highest quality, 
most notably themushrooms were 
fresh and the sausage was not of 
the “frozen rabbit dropping” type, 
which we are sure you have en­
countered in the past.
In conclusion, we would like to 
reiterate our rock-solid and un­
wavering opinion that the pizza 
was fundamentally, “Pretty 
Good.”
Domino’s can be contacted at 
681-1700. The normal price for a 
standard, large, pepperoni pizza 
is $9.49.

WRCT has started a radio pro­
gram featuring the original ma­
terial of CMU students. Slotted 
for midnight to three late Satur- 
Iday night or early Sunday morn­
ing, the program gives students a 
chance to hear their very own 
compositions over the airwaves.
The program is the brainchild 
of Yasu Harasaki, an aspiring 
) creative writing major. WRCTs 
format seemed to him “lacking in 
variety.” Harasaki says he 
started the show not only to offer 
listeners something a little differ­
ent but also to “give people a
chance to get their stuff on the 
air.”
The program will be composed 
entirely of original works of just 
about anything ranging from 
prose and poetry readings to music 
recordings; it may even serve as 
an editorial forum for student 
views. Harasaki has a studio in 
his apartment available to record 
students’ material. The format 
will be comprised of a vast array 
of material. All submissions are 
accepted and, in fact, encouraged.
Ifyouhave somethingyou wish 
to submit you can contact Har­
asaki at WRCT during his show 
(x2883 or 682-WRCT) or at his 
home (682-5840).
Javi rides the infamous London Underground
By J. GRILLO-MARXUACH
Tartan Staffwriter
"The London Underground is 
not a political movement.’’
—Jamie Lee Curtis in A Fish 
Called Wanda
Oh, yes it is, Jamie Lee; in 
fact I have become convinced 
that the main source of animos­
ity between Americans and 
Britons spring from our diver­
gent modes of behavior in the 
London subway. For an Ameri­
can, stepping into the London 
Underground can be a harrow­
ing experience, namely because 
of the sepulchral silence in the 
trains. For a Londoner, the sight 
of an American entering the 
tube can be a harrowing one 
namely because it brings the 
knowledge that the silence will 
be broken. The presence of 
Americans on the tube brings 
further trauma for the unsus­
pecting American in that be­
cause Americans are the only 
ones who speak in the under­
ground, they can spot each other 
very easily and then proceed to 
break the silence even further. 
Consider the following ex­
change, conducted between two 
Americans standing at oppos­
ing ends of a cabin during an 
abrupt stop between stations:
American#!: Ohmy God! The 
train stopped!
American #2: Ohmy God! Was 
this planned?
American #1: Maybe it’s tea 
time!
American #2: Oh my God! The
only reason this happens over here 
is because they know they can get 
away with it!
At this point, the fifty or so 
Londoners crammed into the train 
sullenly rolled their eyes while 
the more sophisticatedAmericans 
proceeded to tell each other in no 
uncertain terms just how unso­
phisticated thatlast remark truly 
was. I suppose that I should not 
be one to cast any aspersions, 
after all, thanks to the fact that I 
am an American I can proudly 
say that about two-thirds of the 
greater London area knows about 
my plans for the weekend and 
certain other facts about me. As 
for thé English, I am convinced 
that their self-imposed reticence 
on the tube has led them to de­
velop a super secret system of 
huhs, grunts, sighs and coughs, 
somewhat akin to Morse-code, 
which they use to communicate 
amongst themselves.
Once the train reaches a sta­
tion, the aforementioned sepul­
chral silence is broken by the
almost sonic boom that is invari­
ably produced when the mass of 
people attempting to leave the 
train collide with the mass of 
people trying to enter the train. 
In my case, the first few weeks in 
which I used the underground 
were spent in getting to the reali­
zation that the words “mind your 
head” and “mind the Gap” are not 
editorial comments on either my 
ego or the shop where I bought my 
clothes and that the signs embla­
zoned with the words “Way Out” 
did not represent the groovy, with- 
it way in which Londoners de­
clare their love of their city.
At this point in the journey I 
could not help but be struck by 
the intense politeness of it all. 
Not only is everything neatly 
labeled and all of the out of order 
signs begin with the words “We 
would like to apologize...” but also 
the penalty for improper use is 
emblazoned on anything that 
could possibly be improperly used.
Although the penalty for pull­
ing the emergency brake is a stiff 
50 pounds ($80, although the way 
the dollar is spiraling into the 
proverbial commode this may no 
longer be a reliable estimate), the 
most heinous offense one can 
commit in the London Under­
ground is what is known as “fare 
fiddling.” The posters glare down 
ominously on the riders, bearing 
angst-ridden testimonials such as 
“I thought I could get away with 
my fare fiddling; court changed 
all that,” “My son never told me 
about his fare fiddling,” and “I 
had to leave my job, I couldn’t 
bear the thought of anybody find­
ing out about my fare fiddling." 
These confessions are all ac­
companied by stark, black and 
white photographs of the cul­
prits. Now, exuse me, but if Fare 
Fiddling is such an unspeak­
able crime, couldn’t they come 
up with a more implicating 
name — a term like “fare free­
loaders” or “fare fleecers” or even 
“fare philanderers”? As it is the 
term “fare fiddler” makes the 
criminal sound too much like a 
boardwalk entertainer.
Speaking of entertainers, the 
London Underground isn’t with­
out its own. While the 50 pound 
penalty for street performers is 
clearly displayed, this does not 
deter them from plying their 
arts. Today I was lucky enough 
to catch a small blues band, a 
bagpiper, and a one eyed Paki­
stani banjo player. Although the 
Powers-That-Be have been 
trying to control the problem by 
piping pre-recorded music into 
the tube stations, this didn’t 
appear to deter the musicians, 
who joined in with the piped-in 
music in order to create a rendi­
tion of “Memory” somewhat 
akin to the bastard offspring of 
a one-night fling between the 
U.N. and the Mantovani Or­
chestra. As for myself, I had to 
trade this spectacle for the more 
edifying task of waiting in a 
queue for four hours for Phan­
tom of the Opera tickets — but 
that is a different column.

writing major who is spending

Announcing a Spring 1990 University Scholars Seminar: K
DIVERSITY. AMERICAN ^Q( IL1T. Ml) AMERICANS CMIPUSES
In the manner of the highly successful Spring 1989 University Scholars Seminar (entitled 
Ethics, Science and Society: The Case of Aids), another University Scholars Seminar will be 
offered in the Spring of 1990, and will be entitled Diversity, American Society, and America's 
Campuses.
Diversity -- particularly racial, gender, age-related and ethnic -- has been and will remain a 
particularly prominent and unique feature of American society. In our rhetoric we celebrate 
these features. In reality,however, we witness numerous examples of intolerance and related 
problems in human relations. Even on our college campuses, thought by many to be one of the 
few safe refuges for reason, enlightened thinking and tolerance, we continue to witness 
disturbing evidence that different forms of discrimination and intolerance still run very deep in 
our social fabric.
These issues pose an important challenge and opportunity for American colleges and 
universities. On a very immediate and practical level, we must turn inward, diagnose these 
phenomena within ourselves and our environments, and devise action strategies that create 
stable and tolerant worlds within our own communities -- environments that do truly 
celebrate their diversity, are enriched by diversity, and seek ways to expand diversity. On 
another more profound level, the academy will be watched closely as it addresses these issues 
internally, with careful consideration of what its role could (and should) be in addressing these 
issues for the larger society.
This Seminar will study these issues from a variety of perspectives, and will then consider 
various strategies for action -- both internal and external -- that American colleges and 
universities in general, and Carnegie Mellon in particular, should consider. Some of the ideas 
to be considered are the possibility of a credit-bearing course in "Diversity and Human 
Relations" for freshmen, other new course work or new components of existing courses which 
could usefully address these issues, and less formal educational activities (such as components 
of Freshman Orientation and ongoing co-curricular programs) which provide students with an 
opportunity to explore this topic.
The Seminar will be led by Dr. Alan Kennedy, Professor and Head of the English Department, 
and Dr. William Elliott, University Vice President for Enrollment and Chair of the 
University's Human Relations Commission, and will incorporate a selected group of guest 
speakers, visitors, and out-of-class activities. The intent is to have this be a seminar-size 
group of undergraduate students, and to have it reflect an appropriately diverse mix of students 
by college, academic class, gender, race, ethnic group and, to the extent possible, age. While 
QPA (in the spirit of the University Scholars seminar initiative) will play a role in the 
selection of class members, interested students will also be asked to submit a brief essay that 
serves as one's "statement of interest and intent," and that indicates (1) why this course would 
be particularly beneficial to them, and (2) what unique contributions they feel they can bring 
to this course.
• TO
.. - i yci
Requesting Entry. Interested students should submit their essay, or personal statement,
requesting entry into this seminar by Friday, October 27, to Dr. Joseph Devine, Associate Z
Dean of H&SS and Co-Chair, University Scholars Task Force, c/o the Academic Advisory Center,
Baker Hall 161. r

Axiom.” The law states the fol­
lowing: At the end of a Shake­
spearean tragedy everyone dies, 
except for one guy who gets to 
stand around and soliloquize. 
(Hamlet provides perfect support 
for this argument, while Romeo 
and Juliet is often cited as the 
exception to the rule).
Conversely, the axiom says that 
at the end of the Bard’s comedies 
everyone gets married, to which 
the question is often raised as to 
whether these characters would 
have been better off in Macbeth.
Although a faulty and unedu­
cated theory, the latter part of 
“The Bardian Axiom” holds true 
in As You Like It, Shakespeare’s 
idyllic tale of love as “sport.”
Carnegie Mellon Drama has 
made an excellent choice of the 
comedy as the opener for its 75th 
season, pulling the production off 
magnificently.
Director Bernard Hopkins 
keeps the energy level at a buoy­
ant and jovial high through the 
entire play, and the cast obvi­
ously revels in the playfulness of 
the language, much to the delight 
of the audience. As You Like It’s 
inherent humor is translated with 
comic precision in this traditional 
staging of one of the Bard’s best.
The story begins with young, 
passionate Orlando’s expulsion 
from the charge of his tyrannical 
brother Oliver, and his subse­
quent exile in the Forest of Ar­
den. Along the way he falls in love 
with the fair Rosalind, who is 
banished from the court of her 
uncle, the Duke Frederick. Rosal­
ind also takes refuge in the forest, 
accompanied by her cousin Celia 
and Frederick’s fool, Touchstone.
The trio play the role of shep­
herds. Rosalind, unaware that her 
beloved Orlando is nearby, as­
sumes the guise of a man.
To add to the general mayhem, 
Rosalind’sfather, theexiledDuke 
Senior, has also made the Forest 
of Arden a home for himself and 
his band of loyal followers. The 
ensuing confusion takes the form 
of a Shakespearean feast of word­
play, wit and romance, with plenty 
of insight into the mechanics and 
manipulations of the heart.
As You Like It is Shakespeare’s 
poke at the folly of love, imple­
menting such Bardian mainstays 
as the altered identity and the 
devilishly-witted fool. The play’s 
theme is intimated early in the 
second scene of Act I, when cous­
ins Celia and Rosalind agree to 
“devise sports” for entertainment. 
“Let me see,” Rosalind queries 
quite innocently, “what think you 
of falling in love?” As it turns out, 
“falling in love” is a popular pro­
posal, and one precipitous of the 
play’s many comic encounters.
The idea of love and romance as 
“sport” is evident throughout the 
play, and is most entertainingly 
expressed when Rosalind, dis­
guised as the boy Ganymede, 
convinces an unknowing Orlando 
to woo her in her masculine incar­
nation. The humorous implica­
tions of the confused love triangle 
between Ganymede, 'Phebe, and 
Silvius (other inhabitants of the 
forest) have an equally hilarious 
effect. Hopkins’ light touch does 
much to preserve the play’s comic 
yet insightful message.
The superb cast, commendably 
headed by senior Jonathan 
Walker, deserves praise for let­
ting the text be the source of the 
humor, not ironic characteriza­
tion and anachronism. Walker 
portrays the love-stricken 
Orlando with all the hormonal 
angst and idealism of a passion­
ate young suitor, and his pres­
ence on stage seems to enlarge 
the Kresge’s confines.
Senior Anne Marie Cummings’ 
Rosalind is equally ardent in her 
ways, expounding wisely on the 
ways of love, yet succumbing as 
foolishly as those she counsels. 
Celia is played by senior Jennifer 
Woodward with the affectionate 
cynicism of one doomed to ob­
serve these bizarre proceedings.
Also laudable are the perform­
ances of the play’s three “wise 
men”—Touchstone (Paul Kaup), 
Jaques (Ro’ee Levi), and Gorin 
(Michael Waller), all seniors. 
Kaup’s lightning-tongued Touch­
stone is thrilling to watch and a 
highlight of the show, while Levi 
as the admittedly melancholy 
Jaques is as charming as he is 
contemplative. Waller brings a 
enviable innocence to Corin, 
whose rustic “wisdom” (“.. .a great 
cause of the night is lack of the 
sun,” is part of his philosophy) 
proves an unexpected match for
Touchstone’s wit.
The production as a whole 
leaves nothing to be desired, as 
the set, lighting, costumes and 
music maintain the level of qual­
ity established by the direction 
and the performances.
By the terms of the Bardian 
Axiom, As You Like It is a comedy, 
making sport of love. Shakespeare 
tosses the heart into the arena, 
calling out “Play ball!” Just be­
fore the buzzer sounds, everyone 
has found a mate. What keeps the 
play from seeming formulaic is 
Shakespeare’s genius for word­
play and, just as importantly, a 
good performance. The Bard’s 
playing field has been open for a 
few centuries now, and the stu­
dents of Carnegie Mellon Drama 
took to the game like real pros.
As You Like It is playing in the 
Kresge Theatre through October 
28. Call the box office at x2407 for

Playhouse presents Edwin Drood
By STEPHEN GLICKEK
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
The Pittsburgh Playhouse 
Theatre Company is opening its 
1989-90 season with the Tony- 
award winning Broadway musical 
The Mystery of Edwin Drood next 
Tuesday.
Drood, written by pop musician 
Rupert (“Escape/The Pina Colada 
Song”) Holmes, is loosely based 
on a novel by Charles Dickens. 
Dickens died before he finished 
the work, thereby truly leaving 
the readers to draw their own 
conclusions. The company of 
Drood has solved this small prob­
lem for you, though. Near the end 
of the play, the audience is al­
lowed to choose who the mur­
derer is by a vote. The company 
will then act out the ending in 
accordance with the audience’s 
decision.
The story revolves around the 
upcoming marriage of Edwin 
Drood and Rosa Bud. Since birth, 
the two have been engaged, but 
as the moment of truth comes 
closer they are starting to have 
misgivings.
Meanwhile, John Jasper, 
Edwin’s slightly mad cousin and 
Rosa’s music instructor, is secretly 
in love with Rosa. He is dreading 
the upcoming marriage and would 
love to see Drood out of the way. 
But Jasper has been friends with 
Edwin since birth and doesn’t 
havethegutstomurderhim—or 
does he?
During the rest of the play, the 
plot becomes even more diaboli­
cal and twisted. New characters 
are introduced left and right, 
everyone has a reason to murder 
Drood, and everyone has the 
chance. By the end, the audience 
has seven suspects to choose from. 
However, this play wouldn’t be a 
mystery if there still weren’t a 
few twists thrown in even after 
the audience has chosen its mur­
derer.
Drood is being directed and 
choreographed by Carnegie Mel­
lon alumnus Rob Marshall. 
Marshall’s association with this 
show began with Joseph Papp’s 
Public Theater production of 
Drood inNew York. Marshall then 
went on to Broadway as assistant 
choreographer of Drood. He has
appeared on Broadway in Cats, 
The Mystery ofEdwinDrood, The 
Rink, and Zorba.
Another CMU alum invloved 
with Drood is Diane Fratantoni, 
who plays the parts of Rosa Bud 
and Miss Deidra Peregrine. Fra­
tantoni has most recently ap­
peared as Fantine in the national 
tour of Les Miserables. In 1985, 
she won the Helen Hayes Award 
for Best Actress in a Musical for 
her portrayal of Grizabella in the 
national tour of Cats. Her Broad­
way credits include the original 
company of Cats and the role of 
Diana Morales in A Chorus Line.
After seeing Drood on Broad­
way three times, all I can say is 
that it is a hilarious play with 
wonderful music, an interesting 
story, and great audience partici­
pation.
Drood previews from October 
24 through 31 and opens on No­
vember 1. Performance times are 
Tuesday through Saturday eve­
nings at 8 and Sundays at 2 pm 
and 7 pm. Ticket prices range 
from $8 to $16 and are available 
at the Playhouse Box Office or by 
calling 621-4445.

Combat bowling at the Joe Bob Briggs invitational
We had record attendance last 
week at the Joe Bob Briggs Invi­
tational at the Bronco Bowl in 
Dallas. The best turnout we’ve 
had in five years now.
Six people showed up.
Course, part of that figure I 
can’t take credit for, cause one of 
em was a drunk that came in for 
League Night, hung around too 
long afterward, and had too many 
whiskey sours in the Tenth Frame 
Lounge. He thought he’d been 
there a whole week and League 
Night was starting again. And 
then we had to go out and get one 
more guy from the Oak Cliff Re­
tirement Home across the street 
so we’d have an even number. But 
except for those two, everybody 
was invited this year.
For those of you who haven’t 
attended in past years or seen the 
tournament broadcast on Chan­
nel 82, Bossier City, La., the Joe 
Bob Briggs Invitational is the only 
bowling tournament in the world 
that starts at 2 am (that’s when 
the rates go down to a dollar a 
lane) and where store-bought 
balls aren’t allowed. If you can’t 
find a ball in the rack, like normal 
people, you don’t have any right 
to be bowling anyway.
The lineup went like this:
I was paired with Vida Stegall, 
the modern record-holder for 
number of frames she’s left the 
five pin. This drives me crazy. It’s 
impossible to leave just the five 
pin. The five pin is smack dab in 
the middle of the lane. How can 
you knock down all the pins in 
front of the five pin, and behind 
the five pin, and on either side of 
the five pin, but you don’t hit the 
goldurn five pin. But Vida does 
this every time.
Wanda Bodine was paired with 
Chubb Fricke, who is an ex-pro­
fessional bowler. Chubb left the
! Joe Bob Goes 1 ¦To The Drive-In-
PBA tour in 1934, and ever since 
then he’s been bowling exhibi­
tions. An exhibition for Chubb is 
when he successfully lifts an eight- 
pound ball.
And then the third team was 
made up of Luther Hobbins, the 
spry old goat from the retirement 
home, and Mack Stoat, husband 
of Betty Stoat, but Betty hadn’t 
been seen for three hours by the 
time we started.
1 was bowling with a new ball 
this year. It had a yellow star on 
it and a big ole scratch like some­
body took a yellow Crayola to it. 
The yellow-Crayola gave me a 
natural hook that most people 
would take years to perfect. I 
started out real hot:
6 pins
2 pins
gutter ball
10-ball spare
1 pin
2 pins (slipped off the side of my 
hand)
but then I changed my natural 
five-step approach to & fourteen- 
step approach — as far as I know, 
it’s the only 14-step approach 
being used in America today— 
and so I was getting a runnin 
start from way back at the com­
plimentary beverage golf cart and 
bringing my backswing up sohigh 
that I threw the ball overhand at 
the pins, like a baseball. I had a 
couple of balls that didn’t even hit 
the lane. They hit the pins first. 
Soon as I did this, I lost a little due 
to my body making an athletic 
adjustment:
gutter ball 
gutter ball 
gutter ball two 
lanes over 
gutter ball that 
bounced out of the 
right gutter and 
slammed into the
left gutter.
After five frames I had a solid 
22. Fortunately, Vida picked up 
all her five-pins and so we were 
only 74 pins down to Chubb and 
Wanda.
But you know what we didn’t 
count on? Luther Hobbins. 
Luther’s a long tall stringy-look- 
ing guy who has a delivery like a 
piece of beef jerky being twirled 
on a stick. When he let that sucker 
fly, though, we had to send the 
assistant manager down the lane 
to pick up pieces of kindling and 
give it to the Salvation Army. 
Luther’s the only man I’ve ever 
seen who uses a 2-pound bowling 
ball. It’s all he can handle due to 
his World War One injuries. But 
he makes up for it in double-re- 
verse English. He puts so much 
spin on the ball that it yo-yos all 
through the pins like a piece of 
Silly Putty. Luther waxed us. I 
couldn’thardly believe it. Luther’s 
partner, Mack Stoat, bowled a 12, 
but that was okay with us cause 
he bought the drinks.
The Joe Bob Invitational. 
American Athletics at their fin­
est. You had to be there.
Speaking of 130-year-old 
bowlers, The Chilling debuts this 
week, flick about all these dead 
people that are being kept on ice 
till science can find a cure for 
whatever they died of. (What’s 
really spooky is the guy who wrote 
The Facts of Life recently froze 
himself. Science could someday 
make it possible for him to write 
more of those things.) Anyway,
The Chilling is the movie 
that asks the question,
“What if Troy Donahue 
were in charge of all 
these frozen people?” 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA 
iiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Now that’s scary.
People are showing up 
at the “cryogenics insti­
tute” to drop off their 
loved ones and put de­
posits down on giant ice 
chests, but once Troy gets 
his hands on the body, 
he orders his evil assis­
tant to rip out their 
hearts, brains, livers and 
kidneys and sell them to 
the Mexican black mar­
ket for body parts.
Then one night, dur­
ing a thunderstorm, all 
the frozen stiffs get 
struck by lightning and 
turned into raving tin­
foil zombies — and the 
only people that can stop 
’em are... Dan Haggerty, 
without his bear! But 
there’s an even better 
one....
Linda Blair! She’s 
back! She’s sensitive!
She’s mumbling! She’s 
determined to beat those 
zombies.
Unfortunately,, they 
aren’t very imaginative 
zombies. They don’t do stand-up 
comedy, like George Romero 
zombies, and they don’t have ooz­
ing faces full of pus that explode 
slime all over your eyes, like Dario 
Argento zombies, and they don’t 
even chew on you, like Sam Raimi 
zombies. No, these are just plain 
old garden-variety zombies, 
herky-jerkin through a cryogen­
ics lab, trying to eat Troy Do­
nahue. And since most of their

Tartan Staffwriter
The creative mind is ever in want of an outlet. The amateur 
author is faced with the eternal problem of finding cooperative 
souls to whom to expose written pieces. Even the age-old solution 
of forcing one’s works upon reluctant friends yields a somewhat 
unappreciative audience, and often depletes one’s supply of 
friends.
The CMU Writers’ Guild, in response to this need, is sponsor­
ing Champagne Flights to Dog Races, a series of public readings 
by selected CMU students. Champagne Flights, which report­
edly owes its surrealistic name to an urgent deadline and a 
random street poster, convenes four or five times a semester at 
the Forbes Gallery, located at the comer of Forbes and Margaret 
Morrison (catty-corner from the now-defunct intermural fields).
Meetings consist of three separate readings, each of about 
twenty minutes in length, and are attended by students and 
faculty alike. Typical presentations include poetry, fiction, auto­
biographies, single-act plays, and other original creative works.
Valerie Adamcyk, student director of the CMU Writers’ Guild, 
says of Champagne Flights, “It’s a chance to express yourself in 
a different way. When you’re reading aloud, many things come 
out differently than they would on paper ... the atmosphere is 
laid back and non-critical. It’s really a great opportunity.”
Champagne Flights to Dog Races will hold its first meeting of 
the year on Wednesday at 7 pm, and will feature readings by 
Jeanette Dravk, Michael T. Rose, and Mark Schmick. Admission 
is free, and refreshments will be served.

Typographer’s exhibit shows at Frick
By MICHELLE JONES
Tartan Staffwriters
‘'Can you imagine a group of 
relatively sane adults wandering 
through a series of rooms, their 
eyes fixed steadfastly on the char­
acters of the alphabet? This sce­
nario is not farfetched if you also 
imagine a Bradbury Thompson 
exhibition at Pitt’s Frick Gallery. 
As it happens, there is such an 
exhibition at the Frick until Octo- 
bfer 30. The show is sponsored by 
Westvaco Corporation; the exhi­
bition was designed by Karen 
Bloom, is Westvaco’s public rela­
tions manager.
"Thompson is the man who once 
suggested that the 52 upper and 
lower case characters of the al- 
J phabet be condensed to 26. His 
j proposed alphabet would include 
L“new” letter forms, hybrids of the 
jtwo cases. But don’t be frightened 
| away; there is much more to the 
| Thompson exhibition than glori- 
j fied letters of the alphabet. There 
[are also examples of his postage 
; stamp designs, magazine covers, 
Icorporate annual reports, and 
book designs. The exhibition is a 
retrospective representing prac­
tically every period ofThompson’s 
long and distinguished career.
In the course of his career he 
has been the design director of 
Art News and Art News Annual, 
and the art director of Madem­
oiselle. In addition, Thompson 
created the layouts for almost 36 
¡other magazines, Smithsonian 
¡and Harvard Business Review 
i among them.
| Perhaps the most famous maga- 
¡zine work undertaken by Th- 
i ompson is his work on Westvaco 
IInspirations, a design magazine
widely read by printers, practic­
ing designers and teachers.
Thompson has also achieved 
tremendous notability for his 
Washburn College Bible, which is 
considered innovative in that the 
words are set according to natu­
ral speech cadence.
Bloom describes Thompson’s 
work as “classic and timeless.” As 
evidence of these qualities she 
points out that his ideas still in­
spire today’s graphic designers. 
Thompson’s work has a level of 
energy and vibrancy which sug­
gests that the designer is a young 
man. He is not. He has been a 
consultant for Westvaco Corpo­
ration for more than 50 years and 
has been a Yale faculty member 
for over 30 years. However, it 
seems possible thatThompsonhas 
discovered a magical fountain 
which provides him with youth­
ful mental energy.
The Mademoiselle covers of the 
Thompson era seem much more 
exciting than those of today. 
Today’s covers often appear 
mundane, consisting of nothing 
more than a larger than life im­
age of a model’s contrived face 
and text which screams the con­
tents of the issue. Thompson’s 
covers, on the other hand, feature 
images such as a model lying on 
her hack with her legs in the air. 
This creates a page with three 
bordered edges; the top by the 
magazine title, the right side by 
the model’s legs, and the bottom 
by the model’s back.
Another intriguing cover fea­
tures a model’s image reflected in 
a series ofmirrors of various sizes. 
One common feature of 
Thompson’s magazine work 
seems to be a subtle touch of
Ud1h1 b1eshFmg «FmhTrb1 t1sU5 
A sample of Thompson’s work, currently showing at the Frick Gallery.
The 1949 Kerr-choo-oo is de­humor, and the unexpected. Th­
ompson is well known for his use 
visual puns. For example, in the 
cover of an edition of Print maga­
zine, he uses an illustration of a 
human eye to representthe letter 
“I."
And then there are the more 
famous examples of character 
alteration. In a series of stamps 
designed for the U.S. Postal Serv­
ice, Thompson cleverly spells the 
word “LOVE” using a heart to 
represent the “V.” Taking this idea 
one step further, Thompson then 
designed a poster featuring the 
word “PEACE” in which he used 
an inverted heart to represent 
the “A.”
There is a consistency about 
Thompson’s work in that the 
underlying ideas hold their own 
and are anything but temporal. 
Also central to Thompson’s work 
is his use of typography to achieve 
“arresting effects,” and to “evoke 
emotion... orcreatemotiononthe 
printed page,” accordingto Bloom.

Slew of shows on 
their way into town
By DAN BroWA
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
After a dry spell, there are fi­
nally some shows worth seeing 
coming to Pittsburgh and the 
vicinity. Most are coming to 
the Upstage, which seems to be 
taking the place of the Sonic 
Temple as the place for new
bands to play.
Tomorrow, the Touch and Go 
Rock Caravan comes to the Up­
stage, featuring Jesus Lizard, 
Flour, and Bricklayer Cake.
In case you were wondering, 
all three bands currently (or 
will probably, in the future) 
have records on the Chicago- 
based Touch and Go record 
label, hence the tour’s sobri­
quet.
Jesus Lizard — David Yow 
and David Sims from Scratch 
Acid and Duane Denison from 
some other band, plus an un­
identified drum machine —
have a five song EP out called 
Pure. A tense piece of wax, it 
has what’s rapidly becomingthe 
“Touch and Go” sound, with 
noisy guitars and noisy vocals 
all shoved along by drums that- 
have a serious grudge against 
something in the last town. The 
drum machine has since been 
replaced by a flesh and blood 
drummer 
whose name I 
forget, but 
you probably 
haven’t heard 
of him any­
way.
As for the 
other two, 
Flour, who 
was in Break­
ing Circus for 
a little while, has a similar 
sound, only with more variety. 
His solo LP is called Flour, 
which fits since he did all the 
work on it. He’s picked up a few 
friends for the tour, though, in- ! 
eluding some guy named Al- 
bini, who used to be in a doo­
wop group called Big Black, on 
bass.
Bricklayer Cake is the solo 
project from Todd Trainer, for­
merly of Breaking Circus, yet 
another member of that late 
band that hasn’t lost any time 
in getting started elsewhere. I

Pittsburgh gets jazz great George Benson
i gy JEFF MULLER
Tartan Staffwriter
A homecoming is an exciting 
! event, and few could be more 
exciting than the return of George 
! Benson to his native Pittsburgh. 
Benson, who has achieved fame 
' as both a pop star and jazz virtu­
oso, will be playing one show only 
¦ at 8 pm Sunday, downtown at the
Benedum Center.
Bom in Pittsburgh, Benson was 
introduced to music at age four by 
his stepfather, who taught him 
how to play the ukelele. When he 
was five Benson won a singing 
competition at a street dance. At 
seven he was given a guitar, which 
he learned to play by listening to 
recordings of the late jazz guitar 
virtuoso Charlie Christian play-

Sunday night at the Benedum Center.
ing with the Benny Goodman Big 
Band.
In his teens Benson played in a 
number of R&B bands as a vocal­
ist and back-up guitarist. He left 
Pittsburgh to pursue a career in 
jazz in the early 1960s. During 
this time he earned his most 
important experience playing 
with jazz organ innovator Jack 
McDuff. The three years with the 
organist taught Benson a great 
deal, for McDuff was tough on 
him and would tell him “either 
play it or put it down.”
Benson first came to critical 
attention in the mid 1960s and 
was soon recognized as one of 
jazz’ most talented and fluid gui­
tarists. He was once hailed as 
“the natural successor to Wes 
Montgomery,” and was for that 
reason picked up by A&M record 
producer Creed Taylor following 
the great Montgomery’s death.
When Taylor formed his own 
CTI label, Benson went with him. 
This association led to sonie big- 
selling albums (Body Talk, White 
Rabbit, and Good King Bad), but 
Benson didn’t realize his commer­
cial potential until he moved on to 
Warner Brothers Records.
His first album with his new 
company, the 1976 instrumental 
Breezin’, became the biggest sell­
ing jazz album in history. This 
was the first jazz record ever to go 
platinum, and to occupy the 
number one spot in jazz, pop, and 
R&B. This album sold 2 million 
copies within the year, won three 
Grammy Awards, and Benson 
was voted the best jazz guitarist 
in the world by both the jazz and 
pop polls.
Following his auspicious debut, 
Benson went on to record a num­
ber of other big-selling albums, 
including the platinum In Flight. 
The years that followed found 
Benson relying less on his bril­
liant guitar work and more on his 
vocals and pop sensibility. Occa­
sionally he would perform in jazz 
settings, and at least one song at 
each of his shows would act as 
reminder to his immense talent 
for jazz.
With his latest album, Tenderly, 
Benson returns to jazz. It high­
lights new recordings of such 
perennial jazz standards as “Star­
dust,” “Here, There and Every­
where,” and “Stella by Starlight.” 
Contributing to this album are 
jazz greats McCoy Tyner, Ron 
Carter, and Lenny Castro.
Benson once again shows that 
he is one of the most talented j azz 
players in the world today. His 
guitar is still like a voice, fluid 
and passionate, and in all of his 
associations with pop he has not 
forgotten how to play great jazz.
Benson is not the only reason 
jazz lovers will find this album 
appealing, because the interplay 
between the musicians also con­
tributes strongly to the album’s 
success. Piano innovator Tyner 
especially helps to make this the 
best Benson album in years, and 
fans will be delighted to hear that 
he is slated to accompany Benson 
on tour.
Pittsburgh is indeed fortunate 
to have turned out such an in­
credible musician as Benson, and 
will undoubtedly give him a satis­
fying homecoming.
Those who love jazz shouldn’t 
be disappointed by the concert, 
which will also offer a great deal 
of music for those that prefer pop. 
If you love the player or love the 
tunes, this is definitely a show to 
see.
Tickets for the show, which will 
start at 7:30 pm, are on sale now 
at the Benedum Center Box Of­
fice, TIX, and Kaufmann’s or by 
calling 456-6666.

sounds like, but I could proba­

The other big concert deal 
this week isn’t in Pittsburgh, or 
even in Pennsylvania, but in 
Youngstown, Ohio, where 
Scrawl, the Vivians, the Clarks, 
Big Engine, and about four 
hundred other bands will be 
doing a pro-choice benefit at 
Cedar’s Lounge on Saturday.
While most of the other bands 
are dismissable (who really 
needs to see the Clarks, any­
way?), Scrawl and the Vivians 
are two of the better bands in 
the nation, much less Ohio. 
Scrawl has two LPs out, the 
Vivians have one EP, Scrawl 
has harmonies, the Vivians 
have freight-train-coming-at- 
dangerous-speeds levels of mo­
mentum, andeither band would
be worth a drive to Youngstown 
(about an hour’s drive alongthe 
Pennsylvania and Ohio Turn­
pikes) all by itself. Having botl), 
of them in the same place at the 
same time, well, you get the 
idea. The show’s five bucks, it’s 
for a good cause, and it’s a good 
excuse to get out of Pittsburgh. 
The show starts at 7 pm, with 
six bands before the Vivians,,, 
who are before Scrawl, so you’l],, 
have plenty of time to find, , 
Cedar’s Lounge. (Get off the.. 
Ohio Turnpike at the Youngi 
stown exit, drive into town, and < 
ask a cop where the Cedar’s 
Lounge is — it’s how you find 
anything in Youngstown.)
Coming soon: Fourwaycross,, 
the Garden, Nomeansno, and 
the Ex. Stay timed.

Harold and Maude
Prepare yourself for something a little strange. 
Harold and Maude is the ultimate black comedy, a 
film that explores the humorous side of suicide. Bud 
Cort stars as the death-obsessed teen Harold. Bom 
into a prominent family, Harold’s mother sets him up 
on dates with girls in his social class. However, her 
son is not interested and manages to scare them all 
away by performing stunts like skewering himself 
with a sword or setting himself on fire. Although he 
doesn’t relate to girls his own age, Harold does find 
true love when he meets Maude, wonderfully played 
by Ruth Gordon. Their relationship sickens even 
Harold’s psychiatrist because Maude is more than 
sixty years his senior. Mixed in with all the bizarre 
comedy is a love story that will move you.

Twins
The premise of Twins is great fun: Scientists tried 
to create the perfect human being by combining the 
genes of the smartest, most talented individuals 
alive. They succeeded, but got more than they ex­
pected. Through an error, a second child is created, 
only he gets all the rotten genes. The two are sepa­
rated at birth and both live up to their inherited 
traits. Arnold Schwarzenegger portrays the gifted 
but naive brother, while Danny DeVito is cast as his 
devious counterpart. After their reunion, the two 
take to the road. One wants to find his mother, the 
other wants to receive five million dollars. Twins is 
worth a dollar just to see the starring performances. 
Schwarzennegger shows good comic timing and no 
one plays the miserable sleazeball as well as DeVito.

Tbquila Sunrise has one of the best looking casts

honest lifestyle. However, things just aren’t that 
easy. Most of the people who have worked with 
McKussic want him to stick around. Kurt Russell 
plays a narcotics officer assigned to investigate 
McKussic and arrest him if there is evidence that he 
is still dealing. The detective suspects that Jo Ann 
Vallenari, played by Michelle Pfeiffer, knows some­
thing, because McKussic spends a good deal of time at 
her restaurant. The three eventually form a love 
triangle. The plot is complex but the film should be 
entertaining for those who want to see lots of action 
or just do some stargazing.

Who could have guessed back in 1963 that one

Dr. No was released, we’ve seen an endless list of 
sequels, but there’s nothing like the original. Sean 
Connery plays the hero with a taste for inventive 
gadgets, beautiful women and martinis, shaken not 
stirred. He’s Bond, James Bond, and in his first 
adventure agent 007 travels to Jamaica to try and 
.find out what is interfering with the rocket launches 
from Cape Canaveral. Like all Bond films, this one is 
packed with action, seduction, and a touch of mys­
tery. Spend a buck to see what started it all.

CMU jazz hits Alumni Concert Hall
By JEFF MULLER
Tartan Staffwriter
Hey you cats, get your ears 
ready, cuz I’ve got some news for 
you. Thursday will mark the be­
ginning of the tenth season of the 
CMU jazz ensemble under the 
leadership of Randy Purcell. Both 
the “A” and the “B” bands will be 
performing, starting at 6:30 pm 
in the Alumni Concert Hall in the 
College of Fine Arts. In order to 
start the season off right, I de­
cided to talk with Purcell about 
the jazz ensemble here.
“When I was here, thejazz band 
was student-run. We weren’t a 
club and we didn’t have funding, 
were just a bunch of cats who 
wanted to play jazz.” Purcell 
graduated from CMU in 1968 and 
immediately went on to play in a 
number of big bands, beginning 
with that of trombonist Si Zent- 
ner (who had a national hit with 
“Lazy River Twist” in 1960) and 
including a summer stint with 
the Glenn Miller Orchestra un­
der the leadership of trombone 
great Buddy De Franco.
In 1969, Purcell enlisted in the 
navy one day before his draft 
notice and was subsequently 
made lead trombone player in the 
U.S. Navyjazz band,The Commo­
dores. “I did that for 3 years, 8 
months and 27 days.” Then, in 
1973, he began his four year asso­
ciation with jazz great Maynard 
Ferguson, which would see Purcell 
appear on four albums. Upon leav­
ing Ferguson in 1977, he settled 
into the Pittsburgh jazz scene and 
in 1980joinedthefacultyatCMU.
When he arrived as faculty, the 
jazz ensemble was finally sup­
ported by the music department, 
but Purcell was the person to get 
students credit for performing in 
the band. In his second year the 
“B” band was created in order for 
more students to be able to par­
ticipate in thejazz program. This 
year, there are 57 people partici­
pating in the program. About 25 
percent of them are not music
majors.
Purcell’s philosophy as a band 
leader is simple: “I’m like a coach. 
I don’t try to fit everybody into my 
system. I create my system around 
the people I’ve got.” This style of 
leadership has helped him pro­
duce consistently excellentbands, 
and the currentband is no excep­
tion. “The sax section this year is 
very good. It’s a dangerous thing 
to say, but by the end of the year 
this could be one of the best bands 
I’ve had.”
Purcell’s approach is changing 
slightly this year, giving more 
room for soloists. He has about 15 
soloists in “A” band and about 12 
in “B.” “I let a lot of people play,” 
he says. Paul Cosentino, a gradu­
ate of CMU, is returning to play 
with the band and promises once 
again to dazzle the audience with 
his tenor sax.
Once thejazz ensemble show is 
over, though, who else can you 
see? Well, besides the local talent 
there are a few great national
acts coming to 
Pittsburgh in 
the next few 
weeks that can 
fill this gap. If 
you can’t get a 
seat for the jazz 
ensemble and 
you’ve gottrans- 
portation, the 
Frick ArtMuseum in PointBreeze 
is sponsoring the Buffalo Brass 
on Thursday night at 8 pm. The 
band is made up of talented big 
band jazz players who call Buf­
falo home. The show is free and so 
is parking. Formore information, 
call the Frick at 371-0600.
Windham Hill recording artists 
Montreux are also playingThurs- 
day, with special guest Toninho 
Horta, atGraffiti. The show starts 
at 7:30 pm and advance tickets 
are $16.50 (They’ll be $18.50 the 
day of the show).
Montreux melds a variety of 
styles, includingpop, classical and 
fusion, into a sound that is light 
and original. Relyingon ensemble 
interplay, the group seamlessly 
shifts between composition and 
dynamic improvisation. Brazilian 
composer/guitarist Toninho 
Horta’s music finds its influences 
in bossa nova, jazz, classical, pop 
and Brazilian folk music. He com­
bines his incredible guitar work 
with Latin percussion to create a
passionate sound.
On Friday, Grammy Award 
winners the Yellowjackets will 
play two shows at Graffiti. Mix- 
ingjazz with the funkier elements
of rhythm and blues, the Yel-' 
lowjackets have created an excit- 
ing yet accessible sound which 
has thrilled audiences all over 
the world.
Band members Russell Fer­
rante (keyboards), Jimmy Haslip 
(bass), Marc Russo (saxophone) 
and Will Kennedy (drums), have 
collectively earned a formidable 
reputation as musicians and com­
posers. Showtimes are 7:45 pm 
and 10:45 pm and advance tick­
ets are $14.50, $16.50 the day of 
the show.
Finally, on November i 
Zachary Richard will play Graf­
fiti. Showtime will be at 8:30 pm 
and advance tickets are $10.50, 
$12.50 the day of the show. Rich­
ard (pronounced Rih-shard) con- 
tributedhissizzlingzydeco dance 
tunes to The Big Easy soundtrack, 
andhe is a headliner each year at 
the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage 
Festival.
Along with his band, the Bon 
Ton Playboys, Richard creates 
exciting music which adapts thè 
roots of the Cajun sound into his 
own blend of zydeco, rock ‘n’ roll, 
pop, and R&B. He may not be 
jazz, but he will be fun!

I forget why I didn’t remember to bring a 
camera on my biking trip this summer. I think it was 
because my father and I were having fights over biking 
shorts. Someone had tipped him off that biking shorts 
were "the greatest things in the world," and anyone 
biking through Vermont without a pair would regret the 
entire experience, but it was something about a padded 
crotch that sold him on the idea.
My father has always taken an unnatural interest 
in my crotch. I think it developed during the divorce 
years when my dad had to do all the Mr. Mom things like 
take us kids out to dinner, pay the cleaning woman, and 
shop The Gap for school clothes. In his quest for single 
father efficiency, my dad reduced pants fitting to a single 
deciding criterion: whether they felt good in the crotch. 
This, budding psychologists, is the real trauma of 
divorce. I mean, I could never remember my mom 
looming over me while I had a pair of new blue card­
board slacks on and asking me to describe how they felt 
in private areas. At the time, I had a vague feeling that I 
wasn't supposed to acknowledge my crotch, especially in 
the middle of a back-to-school sale at the Gap. Now, I 
suppose kids talk to their parents all the time about their 
underwear areas, call it sharing. Back then, I Just wanted 
to hide.
If the pants felt good, which I always loudly, 
vehemently asserted they did to shut my father up, I’d 
get seven pairs, one for each day of the week, and of any 
color of the corduroy rainbow my heart desired.
Anyway, a dozen years later 1 was getting ready 
for a bike trip and my father still worried about my 
crotch. He felt that the scenery of the Green Mountain 
State, no matter how breathtaking, would seem two- 
dimensional if I was not comfortable on the seat.
But biking shorts are tight, clothes don’t get no 
tighter, and I am thin, real thin, skinny even. It was all 
about vanity. I pleaded that no amount of chafing or 
personal discomfort could make me shoehorn myself 
into a pair of biking shorts. My father, of course, thought 
this was nonsense, and we began to have arguments 
over dinner of the heated, intimate kind that brought us 
together in a way we hadn't been for years—eyes locked, 
speaking In low, deliberate tones.
“Look,” my father told me, ‘Til pay for them, 
just get a pair and keep them in your bag."
“No,” I said, thinking flamingo.
And then the eternal parental admonishment: 
“Why are you so stubborn?" Then to my mom: “Donara, 
how did we get such a stubborn son?”
“Can’t you understand," I asked him, “that I 
don't want them in my bag because I'm afraid that I just 
might put them on?"
My father stopped the assault when I became 
this illogical.
I never bought the shorts. Apparently, though, 
my father got his hands on a pair but forgot to sabotage

my backpack. Meanwhile, I forgot the camera.
This worried me for the first few days I was in 
Vermont, mostly because everyone else on the tour 
brought a Nikon or Canon, and one guy even brought a 
video camera (of all things you do not want to carry while 
biking). I was tempted to pick up one or two or three of 
those Kodak Snapshot disposable cameras which were 
even available along Vermont back roads. The best part 
about a disposable camera is you can just throw it away 
when you’re done. But, like the biking shorts, I never 
bought one.
Every morning, the people on my tour would go 
out with cameras loaded, lenses dusted, and shoulder 
straps secured, eagerly taking shots of any old eye­
catching thing that appeared along the way, almost as if 
they were re-recording the Book of Revelation. Small 
airplanes and decaying barns were suddenly important, 
symbolic, cows were not just eaten but noticed, recorded 
on film, and the expansive hills were the continual focus of 
a photo study. Their eye for the ordinary was so remark­
able, I suspected they were part of an extraterrestrial 
survey crew.
Then I began to wonder what I would take a 
picture of if I had a camera, because what I wanted to 
remember was not a visual image captured on a three by 
five card. The memory of my trip involved a continual 
ache in my legs, omnipresent fear of cramping, the taste 
of granola, the haul uphill, the payoff downhill, and a 
continual longing for a pair of biking shorts. Point and 
shoot just could not capture that. (By the way, I cannot 
tastefully describe what it felt like to ride a bicycle 50 
miles a day for a week and a half without padding. If 
you’re going to go somewhere on a bike, don’t be a jerk. 
Get yourself a pair of biking shorts.)
This is what one of my snapshots would be:
My first night in Vermont, I met the people I was 
to go biking with. We went to a bar where we decided to 
Introduce ourselves by telling our favorite biking story. I 
had none to tell because I could not even remember the 
last time I had been on a bicycle, although I vaguely recall 
one Good Friday in high school when I rode to the forest 
preserve and cooked myself a burger. Everyone present 
was telling stories of gap rides—a gap ride is where you 
ride up a really big hill. All the stories seemed to take on a 
Train-That-Could quality—"My favorite biking story would 
have to be when I climbed mount X, and I didn’t think I 
would make it, especially when I puked up my guts Y
miles from the top, but I pushed, and pushed, and pushed, 
and I got to the top, and it felt sooooo good. “ And as if 
that was not enough, the theme to Chariots of Fire pulsed 
somewhere in the background.
I did not have any gap ride stories to tell so I 
went with a story from my childhood. It happened in my 
hometown, Palestine, Illinois, when I was twelve. My 
friend, Speedy, and I were riding our bikes to make a sort 
of suburban drug deal—this kid Speedy knew had 
obtained an impressive stash of firecrackers from Wiscon­
sin, and since firecrackers were illegal In Illinois, this kid 
had discovered an opportunity for entrepreneurship. He 
was going to sell us some firecrackers in front of the 7-11, 
in the parking lot, he’d be on the Huffy, no funny business.
Palestine had a four-way stop without stop signs, 
something you were supposed to intuit. I came zooming 
one way, a beat-up grey Olds the other. I tried to brake, 
turn my wheels, but I got hit. I rolled up onto and over the 
hood of the car, and lived, but soon a police/ambulance 
show of Memorial Day Parade dimensions appeared on 
the scene, and I was terrified. Terrified because I thought 
the police would be able to tell I was pedaling to the 7-11 
for illegal action. I waited for the question that never 
came, “Where were you going in such a hurry, Son?”
They put up red, hexagonal signs at the corner 
of Kenilworth and Cresent in Palestine that read STOP In 
large white block letters. The signs may as well say 
KUSH. I risked my life for those things.
Somewhere in the middle of my story, the Van 
Gelis petered out, but that did not diminish the effect 
because my story would eerily foreshadow our bike trip.
Conan, a Colorado cop, an experienced rider, an 
extension of his bicycle, got hit a week later. I wasn’t 
there when It happened and even the shutterbuggiest 
among us had declined to take pictures, so I can only 
Imagine what it looked like—Conan on the side of the 
road, an arm and a leg pinned beneath him. His wife, 
Cynthia, leaning over him, afraid, and Conan saying he 
thought he was going to live.
Canada Karen was the one who told me that day 
when she found me swimming in a mountain lake.
“Yes, Conan got hit,” she said, as though I had 
asked. I didn’t comprehend at first, because I always think 
something of that magnitude Is going to be a joke.
Karen explained: “He wasloo far out in the road. 
A car went to pass him. The car honked it’s horn. Conan 
was startled. He tried to swerve to the other side of the
street, but that’s where the car went to pass. Conan is 
now at the hospital.” Karen thought he was going to be 
okay.
With hundreds of stitches, Conan lived and 
without any broken bones. A helmet saved his life. We 
passed it around at dinner that night in a sort of silent 
ceremony, the purpose of which was so completely 
understood that one was tempted to ask, “Now wait a 
minute, am I to believe that this thing saved Conan’s 
life?” One by one, we took the Styrofoam cap in our 
hands and fingered the impact indentation like robots, 
shook our heads when we imagined Conan going through 
the windshield one more time, and noted the all over 
smear of dried blood. I'm going to wear my helmet from 
now on was like a whisper in the room.
Back in Palestine, after my accident, Speedy 
continued on to the 7-11 to negotiate our booty. Like­
wise, we continued biking the road to Montpelier, 
Vermont, the day after Conan was hit, although I don’t 
think anyone really wanted to. Two of our party fell off 
their bikes that day from trying to ride on the shoulder of 
the road. And then there were...
That is one snapshot from my trip that a camera 
would be hopelessly unable to record, because it involves 
a connection of the past with the present, an attempt to 
understand rather than merely record. Only after 
reflection did this memory take shape, only in words can 
it be kept.
Dossier is written by those of us who do not 
trust the camera lens. In this issue and the following 
issues, it will be filled with the work of people who 
negotiate the world with words.

fingers. He knew Cecilia was watching him, and 
he purposely looked away, turning toward the 
street.
“It’s quiet here,” he said.
“Well, it’s a dead street.”
Ben looked quickly at her, not sure if 
she was joking. Her gaze was still fixed on him, 
but he saw the ends of her mouth twitching. 
Relieved, he laughed, and she smiled with him.
“Funny,” he said.
“Do you think that girl is pretty?” She 
pointed out past Ben into the street. He turned, 
confused.
“Pretty?” There was a young girl on 
roller skates, on the sidewalk across from the 
funeral home. She had headphones on, and was 
making wobbling circles on the sidewalk. “I 
don’t know. I guess maybe.” The girl had red 
hair, and Ben thought that was nice, but she was 
too far away to see what her face was like. He 
looked back at Cecilia, who was smiling or 
smirking, he couldn’t tell which. She was 
fingering the pendant at the front of her dress. 
Behind her, Ben could see into the window of 
the viewing room. People were moving about, 
but the curtains were drawn, so he could see only 
shadows.
Cecilia rolled up the loose sleeves of 
her dress and slipped out of her shoes, resting her 
black stockinged feet on the armrest of Ben’s 
chair. He glanced self-consciously down at 
them. Her toenails were painted, but he couldn’t 
tell what color through the stocking. She 
wiggled her toes. Ben reached up and loosened 
the knot in his tie. “It’s really hot,” he said, and 
rubbed the back of his neck.
“Come here, Ben.” Cecilia stood up 
suddenly, and walked to the comer of the porch, 
beyond the view of the window. Ben got up, and 
his knees hit the edge of the love seat. He tried 
to laugh, but his throat was dry. He went over to 
Cecilia, wiping his hands on his jacket. She 
leaned back against the porch railing, and when 
he was in front of her, she reached and took his 
hands, planting them on her hips. Ben squeezed 
involuntarily, and felt the sharp points of her hip 
bones. He let go, but she was moving her face 
close to his, and he flinched. Her lips hit his 
cheek, right next to his nose. She kissed him 
briefly, her lips warm and her eyes closed, and 
then let go.
“You shouldn’t have moved like that.” 
She wiped her lips with the back of her hand. 
“You made it all smeary.”
“Sorry.” Ben felt a quiver in his 
stomach, and he licked out his tongue for a 
second, tasting the lip gloss above his lips. 
Cecilia slapped him lightly on the side of the 
head.
“You’re not supposed to do that.” She 
smiled and stepped out around him, back to the
love seat where she sat, crossing her legs. She 
turned and looked through the window behind 
her. “They’re all sitting now.” She poked her 
fingers into the curls above her forehead and 
pulled them to the side, then rubbed her lips 
together, using her reflection in the glass as a 
mirror.
Ben watched her for a moment, and 
then went back to his chair. His legs felt shaky, 
and his ears were hot and cold. His fingers 
gripped the armrests in reflex, as he thought 
about how her hips had felt. There was nothing 
he could think of to say, so he kept quiet.
Cecilia was playing with her pendant 
again. She took it off her neck and swung it 
from her fingers. The pendant hit the wicker seat 
with a hollow rap. She looked up at Ben, and 
then swung the pendant before his eyes. “Wake 
up, Ben. Are you in there?”
Ben’s head jerked back as the pendant 
swung close to his nose, and then he nodded, 
trying to laugh. “I’m here.”
“Good. Was it nice?” She twisted the 
chain so that the links bunched up and the 
pendant unwound slowly.
Ben’s eyes were fixed on the spinning 
silver necklace. He felt himself nod, and then 
repeated her. “Nice.”
“Good.” She was silent for a moment. 
Then, “I’m going back inside.” She put on her 
shoes and slipped the chain back over her head. 
“See you later.” Ben got up to follow, but she 
gently pushed him back down. “I’m going in to 
pray for Uncle Horace. I think I’ll say a quick 
one for Maude, too.” She tapped him on the top 
of his head, and then she was gone, back on the 
other side of the funeral home doors.
Ben got up and knelt on the love seat, 
peeking in through the window. He could see 
the figures inside sitting in rows, but he didn’t 
know which ones were his parents. They all 
looked the same. His leg was shaking quickly up 
and down, and he grabbed his knee hard to steady 
it. He was kneeling where Cecilia had been 
sitting, and the cushion still had the soft imprint 
of her bottom. Ben touched it. The cushion was 
damp, but he wasn’t sure if it was from her sweat 
or from his own. It made him feel funny, and he 
got up off the seat quickly and sat on the front 
steps.
The red haired girl was still practicing 
across the street. Ben watched her as she 
wobbled and pinwheeled her arms to keep her 
balance. The girl looked quickly around, as if to 
check if anyone was watching and her eyes met 
Ben’s. They stared at each other for a second. 
Ben raised his hand in a wave, and she waved 
back and went on practicing her circles. Ben sat 
on the steps and watched. He hoped that she 
would fall, because he thought he might just go 
over and help her up.

---------------------------------------------------

“Oh, Benny,” she wailed. She smelled 
of hair spray, and her earring bit into the side of 
Ben’s neck. Ben detached himself and nodded 
with her in what he hoped was a sad way, and 
said in a low voice, “It’s Ben.” Aunt Grace 
passed him by and embraced the relative behind 
him with a fresh cascade of sobs.
“Come on.” Cecilia slipped past a 
group of old women who whispered the rosary in 
Polish, the only sound rising from the bunch a 
rhythmic shish-shish as the ladies hit the 
consonants at the end of each word.
The hallway was decorated in subdued 
shades of blue, and thin curtains were drawn 
across the windows, so the light was dusty and 
muted. A small sign in the comer read “Horace 
Andrew Posinski” with an arrow pointing to the 
room they just left, and “Maude Beatrice 
Conover” with an arrow pointing to the room 
across the way. Cecilia peeked in through the 
doors to the other room, and Ben leaned over her 
shoulder. He could smell hairspray just like with 
Aunt Grace, but on Cecilia it smelled sweet. The 
other room was empty of mourners. The casket 
at the end of the room was cast in a soft 
spotlight, and the top half was open. Cecilia 
nudged Ben into the room, and they crept quietly 
up to the coffin. Maude Beatrice Conover was 
young, with long blond hair arranged around her 
shoulders.
“I wonder what did it.”
Ben shrugged. “Some disease, I guess. 
She’s young.” He kept his voice to a whisper, 
but Cecilia was speaking in a normal tone that 
seemed disrespectful to Ben.
“I love her hair. I wish I had hair like 
that.” Cecilia touched her own short curls, and 
then reached into the coffin. Ben grabbed her 
hand.
“What are you doing? You can’t touch 
a dead person.” He realized he was speaking as 
loudly as Cecilia, and he dropped his voice 
again. “You can’t do that.”
“Why not?” Cecilia’s laugh was low, 
and she touched Ben on the cheek. “Scared?” 
“You just can’t. Let’s go.” Ben felt 
himself flush. He kept his face down and gave 
Cecilia a light push.
A man cleared his throat by the door, 
and they both looked up. It was one of the 
funeral home men, dressed in black, his hair 
slicked back from his forehead to cover a bald 
spot. He hurried over and gently guided them 
from the room. “I’m sorry, but this viewing has 
ended. We have to close the room now.”
‘Thank you, we were just leaving.” 
Cecilia smiled up at the man as he closed the 
door behind them. Ben looked away and 
mumbled thanks. His face was hot, and his heart 
thumped in his ears. He had a sour taste in his
mouth, as if he’d been caught doing something 
dirty. The man nodded to them without smiling 
and locked the door, then went into Uncle 
Horace’s room.
“Bye, Maude.” Cecilia waved to the 
locked room, and went over to the front door. 
“Aren’t you coming, Ben?” She tossed her hair 
and walked out in a flair of black skirt.
Ben felt a flash of queasiness. His 
stomach growled, and he pressed a hand against 
his belt buckle. He looked back into Uncle 
Horace’s room, but the crowd had settled down, 
and a buzz of hushed conversation drifted out.
No one seemed to notice they’d left. He rubbed 
his stomach for a moment, then followed Cecilia 
out the door.
The funeral home had a large porch that 
ran the entire length of the building. Five wicker 
chairs with blue cushions were set up at the 
comer. Cecilia sat on the wicker love seat that 
faced the chairs, looking out onto the quiet street. 
Her head was resting back and her eyes were 
closed. It was a humid day, and Ben wiped his 
hands against the back of his pants, then slowly 
walked over to Cecilia, straightening the knot in 
his tie as he went. He sat in the chair opposite 
the love seat.
“It’s hot,” Ce<rflia murmured. She 
brushed her hair off her forehead and opened her 
eyes. Ben nodded and twirled his tie between his

A LOW BLUE FLAME
I turn the gas on in the oven,
and stare long into a low
blue flame. During our summer
trips to Oregon, I feared
our campfires would bum
the entire forest
unless I kept constant watch.
I knew my parents would leave me
on the riverbank
because I refused to go fishing.
Later, I refused to touch
the near-dead fish my father
carried back in a silver bucket.
My upward beating heart 
pushed the branches 
above our tent that meant 
to crush us while we slept.
I feared the rain 
would never stop 
if I didn’t wear my 
raincoat, despite the dampness 
it left on my skin.
Those uneasy days
come back like untold secrets
with a low blue flame.
No easier now 
than they used to be.
I sit unmoving,
still doubting my ability
to bait a fishhook.

Ben’s Great-Uncle Horace was dressed 
in a fresh blue suit, with his hands folded neatly 
below his rib cage, black rosary beads entwined 
around his fingers. Ben remembered the suit 
from the past Easter, when the family had made 
their yearly visits to the older relatives, and 
Uncle Horace had given Ben a thick packet of 
foreign stamps. Now Uncle Horace looked calm, 
Ben thought, not rickety like he had been with 
his cane. The old man’s head was propped up on 
a pillow, and his eyes were shut. A blanket of 
carnations and roses covered the bottom half of 
the casket.
Ben felt a nudging at his back, and he 
took a place in the line forming alongside the 
coffin. In twos, relatives and friends were 
stepping quietly up, pausing at the padded 
kneeler, and then moving down the other aisle. 
Ben’s turn was coming, and he looked at his 
mother behind him in line. Her face was red and 
puffy, and he could see tears running down her 
cheeks. She pushed a crumpled Kleenex into his 
hand.
Ben’s prayer partner in line was Cousin 
Cecilia. She was thirteen, two years older then 
he, and Ben thought that she was looking older 
than she had at Christmas, with makeup on her 
eyes and lip gloss. She wore a silver pendant on 
a long chain, and Ben watched it swing, noticing 
that the lacy front of her dress had filled out 
more than he remembered. He looked away
uncomfortably. He had seen Cecilia when they 
arrived at the funeral home, standing in a group 
of the older cousins that he barely knew, and she 
had waved to him. Now she dabbed at her eyes 
and then took his arm as they approached the 
coffin, gently but firmly dragging him down to 
kneel beside her.
Ben looked straight ahead, not sure 
what he was supposed to pray. Uncle Horace 
looked plastic this close up, waxy and polished, 
and his hands looked too clean. Ben tried not to 
stare at his face, and instead bowed his head. 
Cecilia’s eyes were closed and her hands 
clasped, and looking down, Ben could see along 
her side. She was wearing a black dress of some 
silky material that followed the curve of her hip, 
and Ben could smell the sweetness of her 
perfume despite the near stifling scent of roses 
and carnations that surrounded the casket. It was 
the same perfume that drifted up from the thank- 
you notes that arrived after Christmas and her 
birthday. He sniffed a few times, trying to 
separate the different flower smells, and then he 
felt Cecilia’s hand on his. He looked up and she 
was nodding at him. “Don’t cry, Ben,” she 
whispered.
Ben realized, too late, that she was done 
and ready to leave, so he dashed through a quick 
Our Father in his mind, and then crossed himself 
as he rose and followed her back down the aisle. 
He watcheJ ihe delicate sway of her hips beneath
the black fabric, and his gaze wandered down to 
where the thin strap of her shoe encircled her 
ankle. He would have followed her to her seat, 
but as he passed his father reached out and 
grabbed him by the arm.
‘This is your cousin Francine,” he 
whispered.
Ben shook Francine’s hand, which was 
flabby and warm to the touch. He leaned in to 
catch the whispered conversation. They were 
talking about Uncle Horace’s butterfly 
collection, that Francine was preserving in her 
basement. Ben shuddered. He had seen the 
collection once—large cardboard sheets with 
hundreds of butterflies of all colors and patterns, 
each with a single straight pin skewered through 
the body, holding the wings apart. Uncle Horace 
had displayed the collection in his dining room.
He watched Francine’s mouth as she 
spoke. Her lips were covered with purplish 
lipstick, and her tongue darted out like a fat 
worm. Ben wondered if they were closely 
related. He sat back in the stiff chair and looked 
around. Cecilia stood at the entry to the hallway 
in the arms of Aunt Grace, who was sobbing 
through her black veil. Cecilia caught Ben’s 
glance and rolled her eyes, then looked suddenly 
serious and held Aunt Grace’s hand. Ben tried 
not to smile, and he got up to join them. Aunt 
Grace turned from Cecilia, reaching out and 
enclosing Ben in her soft grasp.
