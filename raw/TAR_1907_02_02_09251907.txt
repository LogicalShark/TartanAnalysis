A foundation was laid for what will 
become one of the cherished tradi­
tions of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools when the three classes from 
the day school of Applied Science 
gathered on the campus last Thurs­
day afternoon at one o’clock and kept 
up a general good time until eight 
o’clock in the evening. Wrestling, 
running, sack racing, greased pig 
chase, flag rush, barbecue, and in the 
evening a bonfire and snake dance 
were some of the features of the oc­
casion. Assisted by the Director and 
Faculty, the Senior and Junior classes 
were enabled to have an ox barbecued. 
The Plebes were invited to attend the 
festivities, and incidentally by the 
special invitation of the middle-class- 
men, to choose representatives to up­
hold the honor of their class in feats 
of wrestling, running and tug of war.
At one o’clock the entire student 
body assembled on the field, and con­
spicuous among the invited Plebes 
was their temporary president, who 
was dressed in the garb of a comic 
opera villain, with his hands hand­
cuffed behind his back. Spasmodic 
outbursts from members of his class 
for his rescue were made, but the 
1919 men lacked organization, and in 
the absence of a leader, could do 
nothing. •
The wrestling matches began at 
two o’clock. The first competitors 
were: Felkel, 1909, and Naismith,
1910, of the heavy-weight class. The 
essay began with careful maneuvering 
(Continued on page 4.)
DIGNITY AT THE TECH.
“The Carnegie Tech ain’t so much 
of a young ladies’ seminary as some 
people would like us to think,” re­
marked Squire Mack.
“They did manage to have quite a 
time yesterday,” Davy, the constable, 
assented.
“Yes. Nobody was killed and the 
list of maimed aint as big as it might 
have been, but, then, the Tech is 
young,” said the Squire. “If the lads 
is let alone we may some day have 
here an institution of learning that’ll 
do us credit. And if there aint too 
much of a check on the professors we 
may have a faculty that’ll bring us 
many smiles to the face of the world 
as can be coaxed by them at Chicago 
University. I wonder if it’s still the 
rule of Andy to require a resignation 
with the date blank when.one gets a 
job? If it is, I suppose it applies to 
the Tech instructors and they’ll be 
careful what the say about the laird 
and his friends.
“When I read Hamerschlag’s re­
marks the other day I thought there 
was some mistake. Of course, not being 
gifted with second sight I couldn’t tell 
who made the blunder, but I thought 
it was Hamerschlag. The Chautau­
qua salute is all right if the surround­
ings is right. In a moving picture 
show it’s about as exhilarating as 
anything, but what good is it on a col­
lege campus? Anyhow, whether Ham­
erschlag said it or not, I’m glad he was 
wrong. He’s a fine lad and has a lot 
to learn about the way boys celebrate.

BARBECUE.
(Continued from page 1.)
on the part of both men, but Naismith 
suddenly saw an opportunity and se­
cured a clean fall. Felkel was success­
ful, however, in the two succeeding 
bouts, giving the heavy-weight cham­
pionship to the class of 1909. The next 
match was between Dowling, 1909, and 
Martin, 1910, in the middle-weight 
class, and was the most exciting and 
fiercest combatted of the day. Martin 
clearly demonstrated his knowledge of 
the game and surprised everyone by 
getting the first fall. Dowling won in 
(he two following turns after a deal 
of exciting skirmishes, during which 
it would have been impossible to pick 
the winner. The middle-weight cham­
pionship went to the Juniors. Red- 
patli, ’09, and Matcher, '10, the light­
weights, were next. They danced 
around much the Lame as bantam 
roosters and fought gamely for a long 
period, Hatcher finally securing a fall. 
The two following bouts at this 
weight was not called.
During the time that nearly all of 
the men were interested and enthusi­
astic spectators of the wrestling 
matches, “Pone"’ Urling, '09, and a 
few of his classmen, had busied them­
selves in placing their class flag in 
a very prominent position on one of 
the wires suspended above the cam­
pus. The remainder of the Juniors 
were not slow to take up positions 
around the three nearest poles to the 
flag, and as if to incite the Plebes 
on to the fray, the 1909 yell was given. 
The new men accepted the challenge, 
and gamely rushed on to inevitable 
defeat. The battle waxed warm for 
ten minutes, after which the Plebes 
retired, leaving the Juniors the vic­
tors.
The next event and one of the most 
laughable of the day, was the greased 
pig chase. Bruce Lytle was the first 
to lay hold of the beast, but as the 
umpire called foul it was let go again. 
This time the poor creature seemed 
the worse for its experience and re­
fused to run fast enough to make the 
chase interesting. As a consequence 
it was put back in the crate. The 
pig mysteriously disappeared at night 
fall. The tug of war next absorbed 
interest. The Juniors won very han­
dily and did likewise in the sprints, 
which directly followed.
All attention now centered around 
the roasted ox which was being carv­
ed by Mr. Sharp. After the strenu­
ous afternoon every one was prepared 
to do himself justice in eating the 
barbecued meat and roasted corn, and 
they did. The band concert started 
at 4 o’clock and continued until 8 
o’clock. At G o'clock the bonfire was 
kindled, around which college songs 
were sung and cake walks and snake 
dances were indulged in to the amuse­
ment of all.
At 8 o’clock the entire student 
body formed into columns of four and 
with the band leading marched • to 
the Director’s house, where loud 
cheers were given for Dr. and Mrs. 
Hamerschlag. The men then left for 
home, enthusiastic in their praises of 
the occasion.

ATHLETICS.
With many of the large universities 
and colleges opening next week things 
will soon be on the stir in intercolle­
giate athletics.
The Western University of Penn­
sylvania, Collegiate and Engineering 
Departments, opened Wednesday, 
September 11, at which time the for­
mal call for foot-ball candidates was 
issued by the athletic authorities. 
All arrangements have been completed 
for this event and the improvements 
planned are now well under way. 
The new training house to be located 
on the University campus, Allegheny, 
is rapidly nearing completion and the 
athletes who will represent the Blue 
and Gold on the gridiron are assured 
of better accommodations than they 
have ever had in the past. The ath­
letic field where most of the foot-ball 
practice will.take place has also been 
put in splendid shape for the men.
The prospects for the Wup foot ball 
team appear brighter than ever before, 
as many of the new men with whom 
the athletic authorities were dickering 
have decided to enter, and it is as­
sured that the eleven, representing the 
University will be able to hold its own 
in the hard games which are sched­
uled.
Coach Moorhead, who will have 
charge of the squad, is perfecting his 
plans for the early training, being as­
sisted by Captain Marshall and others. 
It has not yet been definitely decided 
whether the local institution will se­
cure the services of “Big Bob” Max­
well, the All-American star, for as­
sistant coach, but the matter is still 
hanging fire and official announcement 
will be made in a few days concern­
ing it.
W. U. P. can also boast of a baseball 
player who will be given a trial by a 
major league team. “Doc” Ralston, 
their hard hitting middle fielder who 
was chosen for the captaincy for next 
year, is to be given a try-out by the 
Cincinnati Reds. Ralston has been 
playing this summer on the Scottdale 
team of the West Penn League, where 
his hitting has been a big factor in 
landing his team near the top in the 
league race. He will return to the 
medical school for the winter and will 
be a candidate for fullback on the 
eleven, he being conceded as the best 
kicker on the team last year, al­

---------------------------------------------------

though injuries kept him from getting 
in the big games.
Ralston is one of the most popular 
men in athletic affairs at the univer­
sity, and Wup men are glad to hear of 
his promotion to the big league. Those 
who have watched his work believe 
that he will be able to stick with Cin­
cinnati, as he is a natural hitter, a 
good fielder and knowg the fine points 
of the game.
The Athletic Committee of the Car­
negie Technical Schools has announced 
the appointment of “Joe” Thompson 
as coach of their foot-ball eleven for 
the coming season. The former Gen­
eva and W. U. P. star will have en­
tire charge of the team, and with the 
material at hand he should be able to 
make a good showing against W. U. 
P., W. & J. and the other teams with 
which games are scheduled. Last 
year the Tech foot-ball team was one 
of the surprises of the season locally, 
and they made a good showing against 
teams outweighing them considerably, 
although they were handicapped con­
siderably in their practice work. This 
year an effort will be made to secure 
good grounds for the men to work out 
and with Thompson as coach; the 
student body is enthusiastic over the 
prospects for a good eleven.—Carl E. 
Davis in Alumni Weekly.

FOOTBALL.
At the close of the second week’s 
practice a very decided improvement 
has been noticed in the working of the 
foot-ball squad. Under the direction 
of Coaches Aude and Thompson, the 
men are getting into shape fast and 
will give a good account of them­
selves when they line up against 
Geneva on October 5.
Many new men have joined the 
squad, and positions are being hotly 
contested for, with the result that 
every man will have to work like a 
Trojan to land and hold a place.
The Tartan especially urges every 
Tech man who can spare the time to 
support the team to the extent or' 
giving it his presence during prac­
tice. Many of the student body have 
already fallen in line and are seen on
THE TARTAN
the field every night. They are to 
be complimented. But let's have a

DIGNITY AT THE TECH.
(Continued from page 1.)
“The way to ar man's heart is 
through his stomach; anybody that’s 
fond of quoting the has beens will tell 
you, but the barbecue is out of date 
for live ones except as a foundation. 
Feeding is important. Ask any train­
er of prize-fighters what he considers 
most necessary for his man and he'll 
tell you a good stomach to build on. 
It’s the same with a college lad. If 
he don’t eat he can’t fight. And if he 
don’t fight when the time comes to 
preserve the class colors and the class 
dignity he’ll be put down for a molly­
coddle. Mollycoddles have their 
place in the world, if only to show us 
what we should aim not to be, but a 
live college bay aint going to take his 
life in his hands for the prospect of 
getting a certificate of gentility when 
a punch in the jaw is something he 
can prize more and will make him a 
hero among his fellows. So the bar­
becue is only an incident.
“It’s a grand prospect ahead of the 
Tech, just the same. The boys seem 
to be as American as you’ll find any­
where, though why they took it out on 
a greased pig when there was so many 
students around is something I can’t 
understand. Maybe, though, it was a 
concession to the management that 
has the dignity bug working over­
time.”
“Do you think it’ll last?” asked 
Davy.

Squire Mack, “except in talk from the 
men at the head.”—Pittsburg Tele­

GASOLENE LOCOMOTIVES FOR 
MINE USE.
One of the latest developments in the 
line of mechanical haulage is the gaso­
lene locomotive. These machines are 
now made small and compact, so as 
to be suitable for mine haulage. The 
manufacturers, Fairbanks, Morse & 
Co., Chicago, 111., first designed these 
locomotives to suit the requirements 
of contractors, industrial plants, etc., 
but the increasing demand for a ma­
chine that would .handle coal cheaper 
than rope haulage or an electric sys­
tem, led them to modify this type to 
meet the exacting conditions of mine 
haulage.
The gasolene locomotives as built 
at present, may be operated on either 
gasolene or denatured alcohol. In 
gaseous mines, the use of alcohol is 
most desirable since it gives absolute­
ly no odor. One of the main features 
or this machine is its weight which 
will allow its being readily trans­
ported from place to place. The loco­
motives are built in two sizes, han­
dling 10 and 25 tons respectively at 
a load.
Detailed Description of Locomotive.
The engine used is a four-cylinder, 
25 h. p. water-cooled, improved auto­
mobile type, of heavier construction 
than the ordinary automobile engine, 
and is equipped with a governor, which 
operates on the carbureter, thus in­
suring the operator against any pos­
sible danger from racing the engine 
or tearing it to pieces through inat­
tention or careless handling. The 
transmission is of the planetary type, 
and has three equal speeds in either 
direction. All gears run in oil and are 
inclosed in an oil-tight case, which is 
easily accessible for inspection. The 
gears are always in mesh and it is 
impossible to strip the teeth by bring­
ing the various speeds into play. All 
gears are exceptionally large and 
made of special steel to withstand the 
constant and severe service.
Speed and Control.
The speeds range from 4 to 16 miles 
per hour, subject to change if the con­
ditions demand, and it is possible to 
run the machine at any speed for any 
length of time without damaging the 
engine. The frame is of heavy steel 
construction well braced, and suitable 
provision will be made for the carry­
ing of ballast to inci’ease the traction. 
The brakes are of the standard rail­
way type, and the wheels are made 
from heavy special white iron with 
heavy chilled tread and flange. The 
wheels are 18 inches in diameter, 
complying with the M. C. B. standard 
as to tread and flange.
Each locomotive is equipped with 
a sand-box and snow brushes in win­
ter. Suitable spring drawbars of 
specified height are attached at both 
ends. Gasolene and water tanks of 
ample capacity are supplied. The 
burnt gases are carried through a 
muffler to the stack, which causes the 
air to rush through the radiator, hav­
ing a tendency to keep the radiator 
much cooler.
The control of the machine is all 
that can be desired. The operator 
has a full vision in all directions, and 
all the levers are within easy reach. 
Taking all things into consideration, 
it is probable that the introduction 
of gasolene locomotives for mine haul­
age will prove satisfactory. The 
main item of expense in the present 
system of mechanical haulage, is the 
installation of the initial plant, and 
.this cost will be practically eliminated 
when gasolene locomotives are used.

WALL STREET AND THE PRESI­
DENT.
One of the absurdities of the pres- 
mid-summer has been the theory, 
gravely discussed by the press and 
by people in general, that the policy 
of the administration in pursuing law­
less corporations is responsible for 
the decline in the stock market. The 
President is not hostile to commerce 
and industry or to v the corporations 
that are honestly "engaged in busi­
ness; he is merely proceeding against 
lawless trusts, which through their 
disregard of the statutes enacted by 
Congress have been for years engaged 
in unfair dealings, and through their 
rapid absorption of the wealth of the 
country were, throttling industry. If 
there is any political responsibility 
for the present situation it is with
them, not with the administration. 
Successful piracy might give an 
ephemeral prosperity to the ports 
where the gains were spent, but no 
one would argue that for that reason 
the welfare of the people was being 
properly promoted. If the cleansing 
of our industrial stable is going to 
produce a panic, by all means let us 
have it, and thé sooner the better, so 
that we may start over again on a 
sound basis.
But of course we are not going to 
have a panic—the industrial condi­
tion of the United States is too sound 
for that—and the policy of the admin­
istration in pursuing a few prominent 
malefactors ought to have no other 
than a good effect. In leading the 
lambs to their last slaughter the pied 
piper of Boston advanced precisely 
this as a reason why people should 
buy stocks. Because financial circles 
had been purged, ergo stocks were a 
safer investment than previously. 
The argument was sound, but it was 
advanced prematurely and the prophet 
failed to read correctly the signs of 
fundamental conditions which were 
then strongly in evidence. Even now 
there is so much deliberate mystifi­
cation from those who are blind or 
those whose interests are not suited 
by a recognition of the facts, that the 
public view of the situation is con­
fused.
The fact is that the cause which has 
operated to reduce values is of woi'ld- 
wide effect, Great Britain, France and 
Germany suffering from it just as 
America, does. Briefly the cause is 
the enormous industrial development 
of the last few years wnich in spite 
of the greatly increased production 
of gold has led to capital require­
ments largely in excess of the supply. 
The undertakings of new work have 
been immense. These produced greatly 
increased demands for labor and 
material, elevating wages and prices 
25 to 100 per cent, and constantly 
making it more difficult for the re­
sources of capital to carry things on. 
This has been manifested by the in­
creasing dearness of money; the rate 
on real estate mortgages has risen 
in many cases to 6 per cent., and re­
cently the trust companies have been 
paying 3 per cent, on balances, where­
as it is but a little while ago that 
they would pay only 2 per cent. It 
was inevitable that the time should 
come when a contraction in business

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN7
would be compulsory. In the grand 
finance these changes do not occur 
suddenly, although the public awaken­
ing to the fact that a change in condi­
tions has been in progress may be 
sudden. We will not attempt to say 
when the present change began, but 
certainly it was clearly in evidence 
as long ago as last March.
To blame President Roosevelt for 
the recent situation is ignorant, 
thoughtless and unjust. The weak­
ness in the stock market was pre­
ceded by a weakness in the markets 
for commodities, especially for met­
als. Yet with few exceptions the 
newspaper commentators have failed 
to see that the administration, if re­
sponsible for one, must also be re­
sponsible for the other. One intelli­
gent enemy of the administration per­
ceived this and charged that the 
President’s attack on a few lawless 
trusts and railway companies had so 
frightened the ultimate consumers of 
commodities that they would no 
longer buy copper, lead, spelter, etc.; 
hence the decline in their values; and 
hence the decline in their stock mar­
ket. Truly this was a “reductio ad 
absurdum.”—The Engineering and 
Mining Journal.

USE OF VANADIUM IN METAL­
LURGY.
The use of vanadium is proposed in 
rail metal in order to prevent the fre­
quent breakages. The use of vana­
dium in steel metallurgy is at present 
attracting much attention, and the 
great improvements in the mechanical 
qualities of steel due to the introduc­
tion of this metal, are being recog­
nized. Vanadium permits the even 
distribution of carbon, and retards 
constitutive segregation. The quan­
tity of ferro-vanadium alloy required 
to produce the desired results is so 
small that the cost of the steel product 
is but little increased thereby, where­
as the advantages resulting from its 
introduction could hardly be overes­
timated.

NEW DORMITORY.
At the time of this issue of the Tar­
tan reaches the student body a lease 
will undoubtedly have been signed by 
the Director for a house on Wilkins 
avenue which will be given over for use 
as a dormitory for the students of the 
school. We learn that it is a large, 
roomy residence, with every modern 
improvement and within easy walking 
distance of the school. Many appli­
cations have already been received for 
rooms by Mr. Field, and it will be 
necessary for a student wishing to 
be considered, to apply immediately 
to the secretary or to Potts, ’09, who 
will act as house steward. The Tar­
tan will take this opportunity to urge 
any of the members of the entering 
class to avail themselves of the ad­
vantages offered by the dormitory sys­
tem of the school, for it is the experi­
ence and judgment of the older stu­
dents of Tech that cheaper and more 
desirable quarters may be had at 
these co-operative houses than in the 
average boarding place in the Oak­
land district.
DEDICATION OF NEW MARGA­
RET MORRISON CARNEGIE 
SCHOOL BUILDING.
On Thursday, September 18th, the 
beautiful building of the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School for Women 
was formally dedicated. The cere­
mony was designedly quiet, there 
being only a few invited guests in 
addition to the students and regular 
corps of teachers. The exercises be­
gan with the singing of the Alma 
Song, after which Dr. Hamerschlag 
spoke in his usual clear and felicitous 
style. Miss .Smith, of M. M. C. S., 
followed with a short informal address, 
after which Miss Lucy Allen, soloist 
with Sousa's band, sang several se­
lections that were highly appreciated.
We print the following excerpts 
from Dr. Hamerschlag’s address:
“In speaking to daughters who are 
in the full bloom of youth, at the 
threshold of their womanhood, I ask 
you to help in crystalizing both the 
spirit, the sentiment and usefulness of 
this institution.
“In these times of greatest progress 
toward's woman’s emancipation and 
education, many expressions and ten­
dencies toward the masculine sphere 
of action seem to have taken firm 
hold on the finer instincts and judg­
ments of the present generation of 
women, sometimes to their injury.
“It is a far cry from the old-fash­
ioned home and lovely family life of 
the last century to the new woman, 
so-called, whose independence and ab­
rupt entrance into economic and pub­
lic life is so frequently in evidence in 
these early years of this new century. 
It is a remote, but unpleasant picture 
which the household drudge brings to 
mind, and a clearly unwholesome one, 
which subjects women to the rigor of 
factory life. It is a narrow sphere 
which permits all womankind to be 
wholly dependent upon the whims and 
humors of male members of the fam­
ily, and an equally distasteful one 
which shows even a few of your sex 
brazenly trampling their finer in­
stincts and qualities in an attempt to 
disregard conventions in their contact 
with the world.”
I have taken the liberty of depicting
these extremes, so that you and I
might discuss with more intelligence • • >- • • ithe larger group of sane womanhood 
of which I am sure you wish to form
a part. I want you to believe with me 
that the family and the home are not 
yet extinct, nor is chivalry wholly fled 
from the land.
A New Departure.
It is with the dawn of freedom and 
the growth of intelligence that 
woman’s sphere of action is widened 
and broadened. It has likewise made 
her realize the necessity for an edu­
cation different than that heretofore 
considered necessary. The American 
standard of women’s educations have 
cx-ystalized in the development of 
three types of institutions. First, the 
intellectual education; second, the 
social education of the boarding school 
or of the finishing school, and third, 
trade and industrial education given 
at business colleges and trade schools. 
And here in Pittsburg at the threshold 
of the century, a new departure is 
made; certain elements of all three of 
the above outlined systems of educa­
tion are comprised in the still higher 
ideal of the Margaret Morrison Car­
negie School for Women. This new 
departure is an attempt to train 
women primarily for the home, for 
wifehood and motherhood.
THE INFLUENCE OF CLUBS IN 
SCHOOL LIFE.
In the series of articles running in 
a prominent magazine on colleges and 
college life, one is struck by the con­
stant reference to the influence of 
clubs on school life. It is a fact that 
clubs have an influence in a school 
that can hardly be estimated.
Men scattered about in boarding 
houses have no common meeting 
place where school topics can be dis­
cussed. In a club, ten or twenty men 
from different classes meet daily ;n 
the dining room where anything of 
interest can be talked over. The club 
member is thus brought into closer 
touch with his classmates than a men 
who meets only those of his own sec­
tion in. the class rooms.
The men are further aided by being 
able to talk over their work and to 
clear up points that might not be thor­
oughly understood. It seems to be 
conceded that in a club composed of 
congenial men, one can do better work 
and find more enjoyment than when 
living alone.

INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS A CAUSE 
OF PROGRESS.
In commenting upon the appearance 
of the new technical trade journal, 
"Werkstatts Technik,” the first one of 
any promise in Germany devoted ex­
clusively to shop practice, the “Zeit- 
schrift des Vereines Deutscher In- 
genieure" finds occasion for a timely 
remark in regard to the causes which 
have made it possible for us in this 
country to distance Germany in the 
field of shop practice publications, al­
though the latter country is one well 
known for its extensive use of prin­
ter’s ink. It is pointed out that one 
of the most influential factors in the 
development of American industries 
has been the number of trade journals, 
and the free exchange of ideas and 
information which has taken place 
through these mediums. In Ger­
many, on the other hand, it is stated 
that the shops have treated their 
methods as secrets and have been 
unwilling to give publicity to any of 
their experiences. The German writer 
in question freely admits that he 
thinks the superiority of American 
shop practice over that of German 
practice has been largely due to this 
fact, and points out how, as a rule, 
in America the shops are open to 
publicity, and that the principle is 
widely recognized that, without ex­
change of ideas, little progress is pos­
sible. This principle has also carried 
with a willingness on the part of em­
ployers to either permit their em­
ployes to give publicity to their ex­
periences in trade journals, or to per­
mit representatives of trade journals 
to visit and gather information in the 
shops.
There is no doubt but that our Ger­
man friend is perfectly right when he 
thinks that a great deal of the pro­
gress of American machine shop 
practice is due to free exchange of 
ideas, but on the other hand one 
must regret to observe that it appears 
as if American manufacturers in 
some cases at the present time were 
drifting into the German practice of 
considering a great deal of what is 
taking place in their shops as trade 
secrets. It may be argued that this 
attitude has been forced upon some 
concerns by the present-day competi­
tion, but it cannot be denied that 
concerns who stimulate the idea of 
keeping all their information to them­
selves, and considering their pro­
cesses as trade secrets, while for the 
time being they may prosper by so 
doing, will in the long run be recog­
nized as factors in retarding the pro­
gress of American industries. Inas­
much as there is no more certain way 
toward success for the whole nation 
in its endeavors to retain its su­
premacy, particularly in machine de­
sign and machine building, than a 
free, and we feel inclined to say, un­
limited exchange of ideas, data and 
experiences, one must greatly regret 
to see a reaction in this respect. The
Germans, having realized that pub­
licity has been one of the strongholds

their former attitude of secrecy, and 
it would be deplorable if, at the same 
time as the tendency there is toward 
the adoption of such practices as 
have, at least partially, caused our 
supremacy in this country in the past, 
we ourselves should enter upon the 
same road as they have found to be 
unprofitable, not only for the nation 
as a whole, but as an inevitable con­
sequence, in the long run to each in­
dividual concern as well.—From “Ma­

THE STEAM TURBINE.
One year’s service with the steam 
turbine propelled Cunard liner, the 
“Carmania,” has shown results in ex­
cess of expectations. During the 
entire year the turbines have not 
been opened or needed any unusual 
attention. When the ship was first 
placed in service, the turbines were 
run only at a moderate speed as a 
precautionary measure, with a result 
that a rather low efficiency in oper­
ation was secured. On later voy­
ages, the turbines have been speeded 
up, and it is interesting to note that 
the coal consumption is now almost 
identical with that which might be ex­
pected from the best quadruple ex­
pansion engine construction.

THE TARTAN
THE SCHOOLS OF JAPAN.
It has often been declared that it 
was the German schoolmaster who 
had won the great victories of Koenig- 
graetz and Sedan and thus estab­
lished the German Empire. In ana­
lyzing the factors and forces that 
have made Japan so suddenly a great 
world-power, special emphasis is also 
laid on the general culture of the peo­
ple and the rapid spreod of the edu­
cational system throughout the coun­
try. Professor Warneck, of the ITni- 
vgersity of Halle, the leading mission 
authority in Germany, declares that 
the schools of Japan have been prime 
factors in (his process of national re­
generation. In the “Alte Glaube” of 
Leipsic, No. Si), Dr. J. Flad, a well- 
known authority on Oriental affairs, 
and particularly those of Japan, enters 
into a detailed discussion of this in­
teresting topic, and from this source 
we reproduce the following. After 
speaking of Japanese imitativeness in 
other lines, the writer says:
“In the educational department also 
Japan has not been creative, but emi­
nently successful in imitation of 
Western ideas and ideals. They have 
been very apt pupils and know how 
to adapt what they learn from others 
to their own wants and circumstances. 
Japan also thoroughly understands 
what an all-important factor in its 
prosperity its educational system is, 
and for this reason, with the exten­
sion cf its ] ower and influence on the 
Asiatic mainland, .it also extends its 
schools.
“Already in 1900 no less than 81.48 
per cent, of the children of Japan of 
a school age actually did attend. In 
the case of boys it was 90.35 per cent.; 
in the case of . girls, 71.73. According 
to the latest government reports Ja­
pan in 1906 had 27,383 elementary 
schools, with a teaching corps of 
150,301, and 5,154,113 pupils. In ad­
dition there were 266 secondary 
schools- of all kinds, with 4,817 teach­
ers and 100,853 pupils, male and fe­
male; and, further, 64 normal col­
leges, with 1,103 professors and an 
enrolment of 16,373. Technical schools 
for business, agriculture, forestry, 
navigation, etc., existed to the num­
ber of 1,838, with 13,390 instruc­
tors and 110,091 in attendance. 
In addition there were 92 special high 
schools for girls and young ladies, 
with 28,191 pupils. The Japanese
Minister of Education had direct su­
pervision over 2 universities, 3 higher 
normal colleges, 13 higher technologi­
cal institutions, 1 art school, 1 musical 
school, and 5 normal lyceums, with 
a total enrplment of 19,540. In all, 
Japan at present possesses 32,619 
schools of all grades, with a total 
teaching corps of 171,097 and an at­
tendance of 5,567,008.”
The Christian missions, especially 
those from England and America, 
have been a leading factor in the es­
tablishment and spread of this vast 
network of schools. This is openly 
recognized by the Japanese them­
selves.
The Japanese authorities are mod­
ernizing their methods as rapidly as 
possible. The Chinese script has dis 
appeared entirely from the modern 
schools of Japan, although this cum­
bersome method of writing was ex­
clusively employed there for for cen­
turies. In books of a popular nature 
the more simple system invented by 
the Japanese is used, but in scientific 
works the Chinese signs, which are 
known practically to every educated 
Japanese, constitute about one-half of 
the text. In order still further to 
simplify the system of writing a 
“Romaji Kai,” or a “Roman Alphabet 
Society,” has been active in Japan in 
recent years, the purpose being to 
introduce the Roman alphabet 
throughout the Empire; and rapid 
progress is being made.
A notable feature of the Japanese 
schcol system is the persistent and 
determined effort to make these 
schools the means for military educa 
tion and for the growth of a bound­
less patriotism. Military exercises of 
various kinds constitute a fixed part 
in the curriculum of every school, and 
the boys are comparatively good sol­
diers by the time they have finished 
the common school. When a teacher 
asks a pupil, “Who is the happiest 
man on earth?” his answer will be un 
der all circumstances, “The patriotic 
citizen who draws his sword for the 
defense of his country.” In answer 
to the question, “Who is the greatest 
man on earth?” a Japanese boy is 
taught to say, “Admiral Togo!”—

EFFECTS OF COMETS.
Has this year’s comet affected the 
weather? A century ago the answer 
would have been yes. Thus, to the 
charge of the comet of 1811 were laid 
the facts not only of the excellent vint­
age and abundant crops of that year, 
but also that wasps were then few and 
flies blind and that a shoemaker's wife 
in London had four children at a 
birth. Besides such calamities as in­
vasions, pestilences, and the like, the 
comets of various years were consider­
ed responsible for many minor trage­
dies, including the destruction of a 
church clock by a meteoric stone, a 
fit of sneezing that became prevalent 
in Germany, and in 1638 an epidemic 
among cats in Westminster.—-Chicago
