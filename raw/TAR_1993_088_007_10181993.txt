Womeon ’sngrm ueopptmgeam
On Tuesday, October 19, an expected 300 partici­
pants will join in a march against sexual violence. 
The march, titled “Take Back the Night,” is a first 
for both CMU and the University of Pittsburgh. 
The march will begin, rain or shine, at 8:30 pm 
from the Cut.
The march is being sponsored by the CMU 
Women’s Center and was organized by the women’s 
groups of CMU, the University of Pittsburgh, and 
Chatham College in response to an incident involv­
ing sexual violence two weeks ago at CMU.
Various speakers are scheduled who will discuss 
sexual violence. Also, an open microphone will be 
available to anyone interested in sharing their own 
experiences.
The marchers will follow a course from More- 
wood Avenue to Oakland Avenue and will end at 
the University of Pittsburgh’s student union. Fur­
ther speakers will be presented there, and a second 
microphone will be made available. Speakers will 
discuss rape, sexual assault, and the role of racial 
stereotypes in sexual crime.
A related lecture is being held before the march

A17-year-old Chatham College 
udent claims to have been raped 
n Carnegie Mellon’s Pi Lambda 
|hi fraternity house on October 
according to Pittsburgh Police. 
The alleged rape took place 
round 2 am that Sunday mom- 
ng after the Chatham student 
pent upstairs with a Pi Lambda 
hi pledge to a second floor room, 
ays the Pittsburgh police report, 
fraternity brother hit her on 
tie head, and she was unable to 
“member the details of what fol-
)wed, according to the ______
¡port.
Reportedly, the woman 
ras at the fraternity 
ouse with her resident 
ssistant (RA), who saw 
ie woman walking down 
iie hallway dishevelled 
nd with her blouse un-
uttoned. After the EA ______
etrieved some of the ¦¦¦ 
roman’s belongings from 
lie second floor room, the two 
pomen left the house and re- 
lorted the rape to Pittsburgh 
'olice later that night.
Glen Devries, president of Pi 
lambda Phi, saidhe doesn’t know 
inything about the alleged rape 
nd couldn’t say if the Chatham 
tudent plans to press charges. 
There’s some confusion of the 
barges. I know it wasn’t a rape 
barge, and I’ve heard it wasn’t a 
exual assault charge,” said 
Jevries.
Greek Council President 
)emian Johnston said what hap- 
•ened that night isn’t very clear.
After the woman and a Pi Lambda 
Phi pledge went up to a room 
together, “a brother kicked them 
both out,” said Johnston. The fra­
ternity didn’t know there was 
anything amiss until Carnegie 
Mellon campus police officers ar­
rived the next morning and be­
gan questioning fraternity mem­
bers, Johnston said.
Johnston said the fraternity has 
taken steps to discipline the per­
son involved. “They’ve basically 
•expelledhim from the fraternity,” 
said Johnston. Devries would not 
confirm that the fraternity has 
taken any disciplinary actions.
“More than likely, if charges 
are brought up, it would be 
by the city. ”
— Demian Johnston, 
Greek Council president
Neither Devries or Johnston 
was able, to provide any more 
information about the current 
status of the investigation. “More 
than likely, if charges are brought 
up, it would be by the city,” said 
Johnston.
Devries said he’ll know more 
after the police finish their inves­
tigation. “The police are confused. 
When they figure it out, I’ll know,” 
said the fraternity president.
Campus Security is investigat­
ing the matter, confirmed Chief 
James LaPaglia, who was unable 
to provide details. “Right now, we 
are involved in an investigation.

Donna Riley, a doctoral student in engineering 
and public policy, is one of the coordinators of the 
march. Riley said that one of the goals of this 
demonstration is “to get certain changes made on 
campus and to recognize [positive] changes that 
have been made.” Some of the improvements al­
ready made are recognized and appreciated, such 
as better lighting on campus, the installment of 
emergency phones, sexual assault advisors, and 
the SafeWalk program.
Sarah Blecksmith, a freshman physics major 
and a member of the planning committee for the 
march, said, “Sexual violence is an issue that

To categorize it a rape would not 
be appropriate ... I don’t know if 
I’d call it an allegation,” said 
LaPaglia.
LaPaglia said Campus Secu­
rity is handling the investigation 
because “we’re able to put more 
time in than the city police.” 
Nancy Jamy, a detective with 
Pittsburgh Police Major Crimes 
unit, said city police are storing 
the physical evidence but 
Carnegie Mellon police are con­
ducting the investigation.
LaPaglia declined to comment 
further, saying he couldn’t pro­
vide any more information until

completes the inves­
tigation. “We hope to 
bring this case to a 
conclusion in a week

Chatham College 
police have been help­
ing Carnegie Mellon 
with the investiga­
tion, says William 
Donahue, chief of 
Chatham College campus police. 
“We did have a student who re­
ported an assault to the Pitts­
burgh City Police,” said Donahue. 
“The investigation is being con­
ducted by CMLPs campus police. 
We’re cooperating with them.” 
Chatham College’s dean of stu­
dents, Louann Caliguiri, declined 
to comment.
In order to let students know 
there was an alleged rape, 
Chatham police put up crime alert 
posters. Carnegie Mellon police 
did not, citing a lack of danger.

Enviro-committee created
By FRANK MICHELS
Womeon daty PLgerm
At Tuesday’s Student Senate 
meeting, Student Government 
President David Wolpert an­
nounced the creation ofthe Presi­
dential Environmental. Affairs 
Committee (PEAC), an ad hoc 
committee that will examine and 
promote environmental efforts 
on campus. Peter Delaney, a 
senior cognitive science major, 
will be the chair of PEAC. Stu­
dent Senate passed the 
president’s committee by accla­
mation.
At the Student Senate meet­
ing, Wolpert said, “Its purpose 
is to improve the University’s 
environmental efforts at all lev­
els."
Wolpert said at the meeting 
that membership is open to any 
member of the campus commu­
nity. PEAC will holdopenmeet- 
ings every other week or as 
needed.
According to Wolpert, the 
committee will be divided into 
small groups which will each 
work on projects at their own 
pace. Funding for PEAC would 
be provided by the president’s 
budget. Wolpert had indicated 
the creation of such a commit­
tee in his election platform last 
semester.
Some initial projects planned 
by Wolpert and PEAC include 
promoting the purchase of “en- 
vironmentally-friendly” mate­
rials and equipment and mini­
mizing the use of materials 
throughout the University.
Wolpert could not be reached 
for comment.
Delaney had been a member 
of the Student Environmental 
Action Coalition (SEAC) for a
year. Last year, he helped estab­
lish the CMU mug program, in 
which reusable mugs were sold 
through Dining Services.
Delaney said, “As chair, I have 
to propose projects, direct 
projects, and correspond with the 
[Student Government] presi­
dent.”
Delaney said that projects al­
ready being worked on include 
getting telephone directories re­
cycled on time, enforcing 
Senate’s poster policy more ef­
fectively, and establishing a dia­
logue with campus stores about 
recycling materials'.
Delaney also said, “Shino 
Ikeda [ajunior math major] and 
Noemi Gable [a sophomore 
chemical engineering major] are 
working on a newspaper recy­
cling drive. That is one of our 
permanent projects.”

UCC’s black particles make residents question safety
By JASON TOGYER

TPL, dreab W1gy gy e1a pgmye rp o etr9home yamgay,3
In the 10 years since the University Computing 
Center (UCC) was opened, the building’s occu­
pants have complained about the quality of the air 
in the building. Recurring deposits of a myster­
ious black substance 
throughoutthe building 
have raised new ques­
tions about the safety of 
the building.
Ken Burner is hard­
ware manager for Com­
puting Services and 
building manager for 
UCC. Heactsasaliason 
between the building’s 
occupants and the Uni­
versity. He said that 
analysis ofthe particles 
show that they are car­
bon-based, combustion 
byproducts. They are 
primarily soot from the 
Bellefield Boiler Plant 
in Panther Hollow and 
from exhaust from auto­
mobile traffic on Forbes Avenue, said Burner.
“They vary in size from black dust to fairly good 
sizedchunks of greasy black particles,” saidBurner. 
He said the problem occurs sporadically. “It varies 
anywhere from a couple of days per week to once 
every month.
“It’s not in every office,” Burner said, “the people 
who have had the problem tend to keep having it.”
“You can be sitting in a meeting and they drift 
down like snowflakes,” said Donna Donovan, a 
secretary and travel administrator for Computing 
Services.
“If you have a cup of coffee sitting there, and you 
leave the room, you don’t know if some of this stuff 
has drifted down while you left the room or not. 
You don’t know if you’re drinking it or not,” said
Donovan.
Pete Collopy, director of Environmental Health 
and Safety, said that many of the early complaints 
about the air quality in UCC stemmed from prob­
lems caused by the construction process. For ex­
ample, the ventilation system, as designed, was 
inadequate for the building’s use.
“The original air system was undersized,” said 
Collopy. “The engineer 
did not account for the 
number of computers and 
workstations which were 
actually in use in the 
building.”
To solve the air-distri- 
bution problem, he said, 
two large auxiliary air 
systems were installed on 
the roof in the mid-1980s 
to supplement the exist­
ing ventilation.
It was at about this 
point that the building’s 
occupants began com­
plaining about the black 
particles. “Wewentdown 
some wrong pathways 
five or six years ago,.
Ramsey Hong/Tartan Art Editor thinking they were the 
proper solutions,” said Collopy. “We thought by 
solvingthe air distribution problem [the complaint 
level would drop].” The increased air velocity 
caused by the new air systems may have caused 
the black particles to appear, he said.
“The problem has been identifying how [the 
black material] is getting into the building and 
why it’s not being filtered out,” said Burner.
Burner says that the particles are probably com­
ing into the building through entranceways, like 
the large loading dock facing Forbes, and through 
leaking seals in the building’s filtration system. 
“The filter arrays inside the equipment are not 
well-integrated,” said Burner.
Burner believes that the problem could be fixed

Casey recovering 
from virus, listed 
in good condition
PITTSBURGH, October 16 (AP) — A 
spokesperson for the University of Pitts­
burgh Medical Center says lab tests 
show no more signs of a virus from which 
Governor Bob Casey had been suffering.
Spokesperson Jane Duffield says doc­
tors will discontinue Casey’s antiviral 
medicines as well as his antibiotics over 
the weekend.
She says doctors will watch to see how 
the governor’s body reacts to the with­
drawal of the medicines before deter­
mining when to release him.
The 61-year-old Casey was listed in 
good condition. He still is recovering 
from a heart-liver transplant performed 
four months ago.
Casey remains in the medical center’s 
Presbyterian-University Hospital, 
where he was admitted on September 28 
with flu-like symptoms apparently 
caused by a virus. Doctors began treat­
ing him with antiviral drugs.
On October 9, the governor suffered 
chills and fever. His physicians deter­
mined he was suffering from a blood 
infection, probably caused by bacteria 
from his bowel, and gave Casey antibiot­
ics.
He received the double transplant June 
14 to counteract the effects of familial 
amyloidosis which caused his liver to 
produce proteins that nearly destroyed 
his heart.
House finally 
approves further 
jobless benefits
WASHINGTON, October 15 (DJ) — 
The House approved a $1 billion bill that 
would renew emergency benefits to un­
employed workers who have exhausted 
state assistance.
Funding for the program lapsed Octo­
ber 2. The measure, approved on a 302 to 
95 vote, would provide seven tol 3 weeks 
of benefits to workers who have ex­
hausted state assistance, and extend for 
four months the period in which to ap­
ply. It would be the fourth extension, 
through January 1, of a program first 
approved nearly two years ago. About 
one million unemployed people would 
benefit at a cost of $1.1 billion, according 
to analysts.
The action came one day after the 
House rebuffed attempts to strip a con­
troversial financing provision from the 
bill. Hispanic lawmakers had com­
plained about a proposal to save $330 
million over five years by lengthening to 
five years the period a legal alien must 
wait before qualifying for certain wel­
fare benefits.
Yesterday, the House refused to act on 
the measure. The House meeting today 
marked the third attempt to resolve the 
embarrassing flap.
Nearly all Republicans and many 
moderate and conservative Democrats 
objected to an attempt by Democratic 
leaders to drop a provision limiting some 
aged immigrants’ welfare benefits to help 
pay for the jobless aid.
The current waiting period is three 
years. Critics contended the provision 
would unfairly burden immigrants; de­
bate on the matter turned bitter and 
ended up delaying by one day action on 
the underlying unemployment benefits 
package.
The measure also contains an admin- 
istration-supported plan that would save 
$764 million over five years by imple­
menting a worker profiling program.
LA jurors reach 
verdicts on 
some charges
LOS ANGELES, October 17 (AP) — 
When the jury in the Reginald Denny 
beating case gets back to the courthouse 
tomorrow, the judge says he will ask if 
further deliberations will be useful.
The jury says it has reached verdicts 
on some counts but can’t decide others
— including some of the most serious 
charges against the two defendants.
Superior Court Judge John Ouderkirk 
says he’ll accept the verdicts the jury 
has reached tomorrow morning.
The prosecution says it will press for 
further deliberation.
Damian Williams and Henry Watson 
are charged with attempted murder and 
the other felonies in the most notorious 
attack of the 1992 Los Angeles riot, the 
now-famous televised assault on truck 
driver Denny.
The jurors have Sunday off as 
Ouderkirk dismissed the jury for the 
weekend after determining that some 
verdicts had been reached.
Defense attorneys say it appears the 
jury has either acquitted their clients of, 
or deadlocked on, the most serious 
charges that could send the defendants 
to prison for life.

Clinton sends military to 
enforce U.N. sanctions
WASHINGTON, October 15 (DJ)— 
President Bill Clinton endorsed the 
United Nations’ sanctions against 
Haiti by assigning she warships to block 
imports into the Caribbean nation if it 
doesn’t meet a Monday deadline.
“These destroyers are going there to 
enforce the sanctions,” he said, “and 
they will do it very strongly.” Clinton 
saidtheU.S. will alsoimplementsome 
additional sanctions beyond the stiff 
measures incorporated into a U.N. 
Security Council resolution yesterday.
The President said the unilateral 
measures, which would include action 
such as visa revocations, would be 
designed to reinforce Washington’s 
message to military leaders in Haiti 
that a democratically elected govern­
ment must be restored in the Carib­
bean nation.
The U.S. has also placed troops on 
alert at Guantanamo Bay, a U.S. mili­
tary reservation in Cuba.
Clinton indicated that the troops 
could be used to evacuate 1,000 U.S. 
citizens currently in Haiti, including 
embassy staff. But he stressed that a 
decision hadn’t yet been made over
such an evacuation.
“During the past few days we have 
witnessed abrutal attempt. ..to thwart 
the expressed desire of the Haitian 
people for democracy,” Clinton said.
He added that “there are important 
American interests at stake in Haiti.” 
The U.N. Security Council resolution 
takes effect Monday.
Clinton noted that one U.S. de­
stroyer is within an hour’s sailing of 
Haiti currently, and the remainder 
will be in position by Saturday to be­
gin enforcing sanctions if Haiti’s mili­
tary government doesn’t agree to re­
store civilian rule.
Clinton said the warships “are go­
ing to have a very wide berth to en­
force the sanctions.”
The President also stressed that the 
action wouldn’t formally represent a 
blockade, which U.S. officials say 
would present some thorny legal rami­
fications regarding rules of war.
Clinton characterized the warship 
deployment as a barrier designed to 
enable U.N. sanctions to be imple­
mented, including a ban on oil im­
ports by Haiti.
U.N. ambassador urges 
support for ousted leader
NEW YORK, October 17 (AP)—The 
U.S. ambassador to the United Na­
tions is defending Haiti’s ousted presi­
dent.
Madeleine Albright says Jean- 
Bertrand Aristide was elected by two- 
thirds of the people of Haiti, and she 
says the U.S. is dedicated to returning 
him to power.
In an appearance today on NBC- 
TVs 0aae e1a ­mayyw Albright refused 
to comment on allegations that 
Aristide is erratic and unstable. But 
she does say he’s responsible and has
reacted to the situation in his home­
land in an appropriate manner.
U.S. and Canadian warships are 
positioned off Haiti, ready to enforce 
U.N. sanctions set to take effect to­
morrow at midnight. The sanctions 
are meant to force Haiti’s military 
leaders to allow the return of democ­
racy.
A Pentagon spokesperson says six 
U.S. ships are already in place, and 
the Canadian Navy says two Cana­
dian ships are there too. Another Ca­
nadian ship is on its way.
Congress to limit president’s 
authority in Haitian situation
WASHINGTON, October 17 (AP) — 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole says 
he’s going to offer legislation to re­
strict President Bill Clinton’s author­
ity to send troops to Haiti. The Kansas 
Republican told CBS-TVs jo.a e1a 
doegrn that his plan is part of a grow­
ing demand in Congress for more say 
in determining foreign policy.
Dole says he will offer his amend­
ment to the defense spendingbill early 
this week. The bill would require con­
gressional authorization for sending 
American troops to Haiti unless the 
president certifies that certain condi­
tions — such as a threat to national 
security interests — exist.
The U.S. has sent six warships to 
waters off Haiti to enforce a pending 
United Nations embargo against Haiti. 
The embargo is intended to force Haiti’s 
military leaders to step aside for the 
return of the country’s ousted presi­
dent.
ics say seven people were treated ft 
injuries.
Mayor Stephen Goldsmith says 
thorities did their best to keep opposing 
groups separated.
Adrian Garrett, a black Indianapoljj 
resident who came to watch the K% 
rally, says, “We all should have jijj| 
ignored this whole thing.”

Grand Prix allowed in 
Schenley golf course
By EDWARD HAYES
Womeon, ueop“tmgeam
I
Last Thursday, CMU and the 
Schenley Golf Operators Corporation,
non-profit organization, stated that 
the Vintage Grand Prix would go on as 
’scheduled in Schenley Park after say­
ing earlier this week that the golf 
course would be harmed by the race. 
The decision came from President 
Robert Mehrabian, who felt that the 
race was a major part of the commu­
nity and should remain in the park.
Since 1983, the Pittsburgh Grand 
Prix Associationhas sponsored a char­
ity race of antique cars through 
Schenley Park. The event has come to 
be a local tradition that many citizens 
ofPittsburghlookforwardto. The char- 
jjify event has been very successful over 
Mje years, raisingthousands of dollars 
,per year and attracting over 100,000
With this amount of people, the golf 
course is forced to close for three to 
four days during a prime weekend in 
July to accommodate everyone.
The grounds themselves are used 
prm parking, tents, and spectators. 
„Since the race is held during a very 
.busy time in July, the Schenley Golf 
Operators Corporation argued that the 
closing would result in a loss of rev­
enue for the park.
CMU entered into an agreement 
^arlier this year with the non-profit 
organization to oversee the golf course. 
•The University was asked by the com­
munity to take over the $250,000 per 
. year deficit to relieve the city of the
financial burden of the course at no 
cost. Councilman Jim Ferlo objected 
to the idea at the time saying that 
CMU was seeking to make a profit. 
However, accordingto Mehrabian, any 
money made from the golf course goes 
right back to the park.
The change in policy originally came 
in August when Pat Keating, presi­
dent of the Schenley Golf Operators 
Corporation and vice president of Busi­
ness Affairs at CMU, sent a letter to 
the Vintage Grand Prix Association 
stating that they were not going to 
close the course for any events in the 
future. The situation had remained 
quiet until last week when the Grand 
Prix Association sat down to decide 
where to reroute the race. Ferlo, upset 
over the change, said “I findKeating’s 
letter arrogant, and I am not pleased 
with the leadership at CMU.”
It was Mehrabian who decided to 
allow the race to continue in Schenley 
Park. “CMU is an important part of 
this community,” he said. “If we said 
no, they would have to cancel the race, 
and I felt that that wasn’t right.” 
Ferlo applauded the decision, say­
ing, “I am pleased that the University 
has reconsidered, [but] they should 
not be in the golf course.” 
Mehrabian’s decision is one that is 
applauded by the Pittsburgh commu­
nity. “I think it’s important to be a 
positive part of the community,” he 
said, “as they are a positive part ofthe 
University.” The Vintage Grand Prix 
will go on as planned as a relatively 
new Pittsburgh tradition gets over its 
first hurdle.

*EAC encourages recycling

“PEAC wotild like to encourage stu- 
lents to develop projects of their own,” 
aid Delaney. “The president will have 
noney available for funding.” Delaney 
aid that the projects have to benefit 
!MU and involve some use of recycling 
ir.waste reduction programs, especially 
raa yearly basis.
josh Knauer, a junior environmental 
science and policy self-defined major, 
helped form PEAC.
Knauer was a member of SEAC for 
light years, in addition to being one of 
le founders of SEAC at CMU. Knauer
said that the difference between the two 
organizations is that SEAC deals with 
national environmental issues, whereas 
PEAC will deal only with environmen­
tal issues affecting CMU.
Knauer said that the first thing PEAC 
is working on is a list of recommenda­
tions for all offices on campus to act on 
environmental guidelines. Knauer said 
these include incorporating double-sided 
copies and encouraging “green purchas­
ing.”
“This is the ‘green initiative’ for the 
campus,” said Knauer. “I think this is a 
very bold initiative.”

building’s duct work should be com­
pletely cleaned.
Collopy said that EH&S first looked 
for an external source of the black par­
ticles. He said that as his office has 
exhausted most of the external 
possibilties, it began to look for an inter­
nal source. A previously unknown form 
of insulation was recently discovered in 
the ventilation system, Collopy said.
“Today we managed to explore an in­
ternal pathway,” said Collopy, “an insu­
lation in some parts of the ventilation 
system we didn’t realize was in there. 
The air-distribution fix may have been 
the reason'that this insulation began to 
crumble.”
Collopy said that samples of the insu­
lation are going to be analyzed and com­
pared to the black particles being found 
in UCC to see if they are composed of the 
same material.
Some residents of the building have 
been told that it was unlikely that they 
were inhaling any of the particles. “I 
find it fascinating that they say that this 
cannot get into our respiratory systems,” 
said Pete Bronder, director of Data Com­
munications. “They keep saying that 
[the particulate matter] settles on the 
floor. Well, it has to be drifting past my 
face and nose, first.
‘The black stuff that we’re breathing 
might not be hurting us now,” Bronder 
said, “but it might hurt us later.”
“I can’t say for sure that it isn’t harm­
ful,” said Collopy. “I can’t give a 100 
percent certainty. We’re well below the 
clean air criteria that have been set for 
airborne particles. We don’t have any 
standards for this type of matter at this 
level.”
“They come around and say to us that 
the particles that we are observing can­
not be breathed in,” said Donovan. “Is it 
not safe to assume that if there are these
big particles, then there are smaller 
particles as well that we can breathe 
in?”
, Collopy said that the black particles 
do not necessarily pose a health risk, 
although soot is a carcinogen. “The rela­
tive amount of this carcinogen is not any 
more than anything you’d breath in any­
where else,” said Collopy.
The particles tend to collect on flat 
surfaces, like desktops and floors, and 
around the ceiling vents, called 
Modulines. Collopy said that the 
Moduline units are designed to close off 
the flow of air to rooms that reach a 
certain ambient temperature. This is 
the reason that the chunks of black ma­
terial tend to come and go, said Collopy.
“The Moduline unit is a very narrow 
diffuser,” said Collopy. The diffusers open 
and close, he said, and when “the 
Modulines are closed, they act as a trap.”
Collopy says the “large chunks” of black 
dust form in the closed Modulines. When 
the system turns on or the Moduline re­
opens, the chunks break loose. “This 
stuff builds up in the Moduline over the 
weekend, or when people aren’t in the 
room for a while, and then when we 
shake the system up, it comes out.”
Physical Plant has been installing blue 
dust filters directly over the Modulines 
in rooms where the dust is particularly 
bad. Residents of UCC charge that these 
filters are not regularly changed. Fur­
thermore, said Bronder, “chunks like 
that should be filtered out before they 
get in here.”
Representatives of Physical Plant and 
EH&S held a conference in the building 
two weeks ago, said Donovan, and be­
fore the visit American Building Main­
tenance (ABM) sent an employee through 
UCC to clean the Moduline units off 
with a broom.
“They sent some poor schmuck around 
with a broom to clean off the particles,” 
said Bronder. He said that the black 
particles, and fiberglass from the ceiling
tiles, were spread all over the offices in 
the building.
Ron Carter, director of Physical Plant, 
said that the incident was an accident. 
“We asked [ABM] to vacuum those 
things, and that was the request [the on­
site manager] made to her people, and 
as it went through the system, it was 
misinterpreted,” said Carter.
Carter said that it was just coinci­
dence that the cleaning occured before 
the conference. “It really didn’t have 
anything to do with the timing of the 
meeting over there,” said Carter.
“We have decided to hold off on any 
additional cleaning of the Modulines 
until the duct work is cleaned,” Carter 
said. The work is being done by an out­
side contractor, he said, and indicated 
that they expect it to be started within a 
month.
John Leong, technical director for 
Computing Services, pointed out where 
one resident had laid out clean sheets of 
white bond paper each evening and dated 
them whenever he found fresh residue 
on them. The sheets formed a thick stack 
going back to the beginning of summer. 
Leong pointed out window ledges and 
bookcases where a few weeks’ accumu­
lation of particles had formed a thick 
layer.
“The stuff that drops down is inconve­
nient, because it causes dirt,” said Leong. 
“What about the stuff that’s airborne 
and doesn’t drop down?”
“We need to eliminate these black par­
ticles,” said Collopy, “whether they’re a 
health risk or just an annoyance, we 
have to get them out.”
Besides cleaning the duct work, the 
University is going to work on sealing 
filter units inside the system, said 
Collopy.

affects everyone, especially in a campus community.”
Both Riley and Blecksmith said that there are improvements yet to be made. They each 
offer the suggestion of free self-defense classes for women.
Riley said that for prevention reasons, the fraternities'should be more involved in 
education related to sexual assault. One of the hopes of the group is to dispel any myths 
concerning rape. Riley notes that 84 percent of college women who are raped will know 
their attacker.
The main goal of this march is to create awareness of the sexual violence on college 
campuses. In cases of this violence, Riley said, “Silence is a form of abuse.”

Crime and Incident Report
10/1 DISORDERLY CONDUCT,
6:08 pm. A student contacted Campus 
police and reported that someone was 
being attacked near Resnik.
The student said that he saw a green 
car chasing a maroon car. The green car 
blocked the maroon car from exiting. 
The front passenger got out of the car 
and started kicking and hitting the ve­
hicle. It was at this time that Campus 
police was notified.
All units responded. While being dis­
patched, the units were informed that 
the individual got into the green car, 
'turned left on Margaret Morrison Street, 
and was heading towards Forbes Av- 
:¦ enue. The responding officer who was on 
Margaret Morrison Street stopped the 
vehicle in front of the co-op store.
There were three occupants in the car. 
At first, they denied being involved with 
any activity. Then, one of the passen­
gers said that he was the one hitting the 
other vehicle. The maroon vehicle be­
longed to his mother’s boyfriend.
A check with the city found that the 
green car was registered to a car rental 
company. A check to see if the car was 
stolen proved negative. A check for out­
standing warrants on the occupants also 
proved negative.
10/2 MARIJUANA, 10:56 pm. An of­
ficer was in the Mudge House on a rou­
tine room opening when she came upon 
a strong odor of marijuana. The odor 
was very prominent in Mudge B-Tower, 
second floor. The occupants in the room 
where the odor was strongest had the 
door open, but the officer could not see 
smoke.
C The officer questioned the occupants 
about them smoking any type of veg­
etable matter. They denied smoking 
anything. The resident was informed 
that he was responsible for activities 
taking place in his room. He was warned 
that further violations would result in a 
citation.
10/5 VEHICLE THEFT, 12:13 pm. 
While patrolling a Physical Plant dem­
onstration, an officer noticed two stu­
dents riding a Physical Plant electric 
cart behind Morewood Gardens. They 
were stopped and IDed. When asked 
why they were driving in a reckless 
manner, they said, “Oh, we were just 
riding.” The electric cart was left unat­
tended by Physical Plant workers in 
front of the Morewood Gardens mainte­
nance office.
10/5 ASSAULT, 10:48 pm. A student 
reported to a campus detective that she 
had received several threatening tele­
phone calls from another student who 
lives in an off-campus apartment. The 
student went to.see her to discuss these 
threats, accompanied by two other CMU 
students.
When the three arrived, the student 
receiving the threats knocked on the 
door, and the door was opened by the 
student threatening her. The harasser
grabbed the student, pulled her into the 
apartment, and slammed the door so the 
other two students could not enter.
Once inside, the harasser and her 
roommate shut out the lights to the 
apartment and proceeded to assault the 
student both verbally and physically. At 
one point, the student said she was 
beaten with a 4" x 4" piece of wood.
The two of them then threw her face 
first into the glass in the door to the 
apartment. Outside of the apartment, 
the two jumped on her and threw her 
into the radiator.
After the student was pulled into the 
apartment, the other two students 
banged on the door to get the occupants 
to open the door. Both students could 
hear threats being made.
The assaulted student said that the 
two threatened to bring up friends from 
Washington, D.C., who would be armed 
with guns. She also said that the two 
had been involved with conflicts at the 
University of Pittsburgh and Duquesne 
University.
She was advised as to her options of 
pursuing the case via the local Magis­
trate and/or Student Affairs. She pur­
sued both options but declined the ser­
vices of the Counseling Center or the 
Area Coordinator. She also declined 
medical treatment and transportation, 
except for an ice pack.
She requested that photos be taken of 
her to document her injuries. The detec­
tive took five Polaroid photographs of 
her. She was instructed to call Campus 
Police immediately if more threats fol­
low.
On October 13, the student had a meet­
ing with the two assaultants and Stu­
dent Affairs. At that time, all parties 
agreed to have no contact, either verbal, 
physical, or by telephone. As long as 
both parties five up to their agreement, 
the student will not file charges. The 
investigation was closed.
10/8 ASSAULT/MEDICAL, 3:05 am. 
An alum reported that a student was 
assaulted on Forbes Avenue between 
Panther Hollow Inn (PHI) and the Exxon 
station. This incident was the result of 
another incident that the student had in 
front of PHI.
The student said that he had come out 
of PHI and there was a group of about 12 
people on the sidewalk. The student 
bumpedinto one ofthem, whomhe knows 
only by first name. They talked for sev­
eral minutes, during which the student 
said it was an accident. The student said 
that the person seemed to be playing a 
mind game with him and seemed to be 
joking. Both parties left the area.
The student was waiting for some 
friends in the area between PHI and 
Exxon and was talking to a group there 
when he heard someone say, “That’s the 
one.” When he turned, he was punched 
in the face by somebody else. The stu­
dent sustained a laceration above the 
left eye and a bruise under it.
After the altercation, the student
talked to the person who hit him, the 
person he bumped into, and one other 
person with whom the student had sev­
eral classes.
Again, he said that the incident in 
front of PHI was an accident, but he was 
not going to get down on his knees and 
say he was sorry. Afterward, the stu­
dent proceeded up Forbes Avenue, and 
the three people went behind Morewood 
Gardens. Student EMS responded and 
the student was transported to Presby­
terian Hospital.
10/8 BOMB THREAT, 3:42 pm. A 
CMU officer heard a Pittsburgh Police 
radio transmission indicating that a 
bomb threat was received for the Gym­
nasium. It was learned that the Pitts­
burgh Police station received a phone 
call stating that a bomb at the Gym 
could go off anytime until 7 pm.
A check of the interior and exterior of 
the gym was conducted. During this 
search, no suspicious packages were dis­
covered.
However, due to the numerous areas 
where a device could be concealed, and 
in the best interest of the campus com­
munity, the Gym was closed for the day.
10/12 HIT BY CAR ON BICYCLE,
9:11 pm. A bicycle rider was attempting 
to enter the sidewalk heading north via 
the driveway between PiKA and SAE 
when at the same time, the driver of a 
Jeep was entering the driveway heading 
south. The Jeep struck the front tire of 
the bicycle.
The bicycle rider was lying on the hood 
of the Jeep. He was conscious and alert 
and responded to questions. The driver 
was sitting on the wall crying but made 
no complaint of beinginjured. CMU EMS 
and City Medics treated and evaluated 
the bicycle rider. He refused transporta­
tion to the hospital. He and his bicycle 
were transported to his home by Cam­
pus Police. The driver was able to drive 
home. Both parties were supplied infor­
mation on the other by the City Police, 
who also responded. Both parties were 
CMU students.

Vice-Chair of Senate 
resigns disappointed
By FRANK MICHELS
Womeon daty PLgerm
On October 4,1993, Greg Haverkamp, 
vice-chair of Student Senate, submitted 
his letter of resignation as a CIT Sena­
tor. Haverkamp said that he resigned 
because he “had become somewhat dis­
enchanted with the pace that things 
were moving and path in which things 
were taken.”
Haverkamp had been on Student Sen­
ate for four semesters, in which he had 
become chair of the Rules Committee, 
chair of the Constitution Committee, 
chair of Student Senate, and vice-chair 
of Student Senate. Haverkamp drafted 
the Bylaws of the Student Body as well 
as organized the Hunt Library sit-ins 
last month.
According to Haverkamp, the current 
Student Senate has no vision for the 
student body. “The student body has lost 
faith in Student Senate as a representa­
tive and authoritative body,” said 
Haverkamp.
Haverkamp said he was very disap­
pointed in the leadership of Student 
Senate. For example, he said that com­
mittee assignments were not given out 
until the third week of Student Senate. 
He said that committee assignments 
should have been done on the first day 
and calls the actions of the current chair 
“inexcusable.”
In his letter of resignation, Haverkamp 
cites the changes and problems that 
currently face Student Senate. He criti­
cized the chair as well as the committee 
chairs of Student Senate. BurtHolzman, 
chair of Student Senate, refused to com­
ment on Haverkamp’s resignation.
‘The old Senate had done things,” said 
Haverkamp. “It had a lot of people who 
were serious about Student Senate. The
Executive Committee made a lot of deci­
sions. There were reports from the com­
mittees about bicycle racks and the gym. 
Bigger was better; things ran from the 
top.”
According to Haverkamp, if Senate 
just passed the recent resolution con­
demning Hunt Library for shortening 
its hours, nothing would have been done. 
However, because of the three library 
sit-ins, the administration listened to 
us.
Senator Moneet Singh, chair of 
Senate’s Human Resources Committee, 
said that he understands how 
Haverkamp feels. “I felt much the same 
way about the two previous Senate 
leaderships,” said Singh.
Singh said that the problems with 
Senate that Haverkamp identified in 
his letter of resignation are “very real,... 
but no one, Haverkamp included, has 
really posed any solutions.”
Singh said, “The current Senate is 
very new, and it will take a while for it to 
define itself. Just because it isn’t trying 
to be unnecessarily controversial as it 
has in the past, does not mean people are 
not trying to address issues.”
The last Senator before Haverkamp 
who resigned because of pessimism was 
Josh Knauer, a junior environmental 
science and policy self-defined major. 
Knauer resigned in April last semester.
“I felt Student Senate was not a ve­
hicle for being an effective organization 
on campus,” said Knauer. Knauer said 
that last semester, Student Senate was 
not fulfilling its role as a representative 
body.
“I agree with what [Haverkamp] said,” 
said Knauer. “It’s very indicative of the 
way Student Senate is structured. Stu­
dent Senate is completely out of touch 
with the student body.”

there’s a possibility of that crime be­
ing a danger to the community. This 
time, we don’t think there’s a danger 
of that crime spreading,” said 
LaPaglia.
Even so, anonymous posters entitled 
“Sexual Assault” that summarized the 
alleged rape appeared on Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus last weekend.
Michael Murphy, dean of Student 
Affairs, said he hears of five to 10 
sexual assaults at Carnegie Mellon 
each semester, but that reflects only a 
small percentageof the actual assaults 
that occur.
“Our estimation, using national fig­
ures, is that number may be closer to 
50,” said Murphy.
According to FBI statistics, only 
about one in 10 rapes is reported to 
police. Most of the unreported rapes 
are committed by acquaintances.
There is a good chance Carnegie
Mellon will try to handle the case 
through the Student Affairs office, says 
Mirian Galtz, a medical advocate at 
Pittsburgh Action Against Rape 
(PAAR).
Galtz, a expert on rape, says schools 
often try to pursue interrial disciplin­
ary measures.
“I know a lot of schools attempt to 
solve ‘the problem of rape’ internally. 
They certainly prefer not to call police 
in. There’s a lot of pressure from the 
administration in a lot of cases,” said 
Galtz.
According to Galtz, very few rapes 
are reported. “I believe the estimates 
are one in 10 rapes are reported, which 
means that 90 percent are not,” said 
Galtz. “It’s important to address this 
realistically.”
PAAR offers medical advocates for 
people who have been raped, as well as 
individual and group crisis counsel­
ing, said Galtz.

Campus Police must 
always post crime alerts
Two weeks ago, a rape allegedly 
[occurred at the Pi Lambda Phi 
I fraternity, butto this day, no crime 
alert has been posted by Campus 
'Police. Two other rapes allegedly 
^happened on Frew Street last 
¡spring, and in those cases, crime 
i alerts were posted within 24 
'hours. Why, though Chatham’s 
[campus police have done so, has 
.no such crime alert been posted 
•by Carnegie Mellon’s police force 
¦in this case?
Are acquaintance rapes left un- 
i reported or covered up by Cam- 
,pus Police? And, if so, are there no 
•releases at all about what hap- 
¦ 'pened?
Rape is rape. Any rape that is 
1 reported to Campus Police, ac­
quaintance or otherwise, must 
receive equal treatment. There 
should be reasonably detailed 
alerts, containinginformation and 
prevention tips, posted around 
campus as soon as possible after 
the initial report is made to Cam- 
| pus Police.
|: According to Campus Police 
I Chief Jim LaPaglia, crime alerts 
; ;are not posted for incidents that 
i' do not pose an immediate danger 
! i or threat to the campus body. But 
I -statistics show that what 
i LaPaglia does not see as an “im- 
I pedíate threat” will be exactly 
I ,.that to 25% of women sometime 
¡ in their teens. And disseminating 
I information about such alleged 
; attacks can help students to be 
. more aware and cautious of their 
; daily activities. It encourages 
j them to consider a rather dis- 
1 turbing question: Could this hap- 
| pen to me?
i It is a shame that such events 
| occur on CMU’s campus, and it is 
! inexcusable that people commit 
i thesecrimes.Butthestudentbody 
I has the right to know if these 
| events do occur, 
j 1 Crime alerts increase aware- 
| ness. When students see the words 
I “CRIME ALERT” on a poster in
their dorms or on the way to 
classes, they stop to read. Crime 
alerts are discussed among peers. 
They encourage students to take 
precautionary measures that they 
normally bother to take, such as 
using the SafeWalk or Escort pro­
grams or locking bedroom doors, 
regardless of the time of day.
A crime alert is the only effec­
tive and immediate way of in­
forming the campus community 
when crimes occur. No crimes 
should be kept secret from stu­
dents, least of all sexual crimes. 
In cases like these, what other 
sources ofreliable information are 
there besides Campus Police? If 
we can’t count on Campus Police 
for this information, who are we 
to rely upon? Gossip-mongers? 
Surely our knowledge concerning 
campus crime should be more re­
liable than whatever rumors we 
overhear on the Cut.
In the past, crime alerts have 
not only emphasized the current 
nature of campus crime, but also 
included tips bn self-protection 
and awareness. The campus com­
munity has the right to know what 
dangers we can face, and what 
precautionary measures can be 
taken.
One final concern of posting 
crime alerts is the effect they have 
on the individuals involved in the 
posted incident. Victims of sexual 
assault and rape should not be 
ashamed, and they should report 
incidents as soon as they can. The 
crime alerts posted around cam­
pus are made anonymous enough 
that the victim of the crime can 
not be easily determined.
All people should seek aid in 
dealing with their victimization. 
Police organizations, especially 
our Campus Police, should let stu­
dents know about all possible 
dangers that exist on campus, or 
they risk increased harm to stu­
dents who move blissfully through 
life, sure of their invulnerability.

X was standing on 
Forbes Avenue across 
from CMU this after­
noon [Oct. 3] holding 
a Life Chain sign, 
quietly and peacefully praying that our 
country turn away from its embrace of 
the violence of abortion. The sign reads, 
“ABORTION KILLS CHILDREN.”That 
is a simple fact. Some people believe 
that the children who are killed by abor­
tion do not deserve to be protected from 
the violence of abortion. Others believe 
as I do, that abortion kills human beings 
and that it should be stopped.
The reason I am writing is to ask you 
for your opinion of one of the students I 
encountered today. He came across 
Forbes Avenue on his way to one of the 
student houses and deliberately shoul­
dered me as I was standing there pray­
ing. After he shouldered me, he and 
others in the group he was with had a 
good laugh about what he had done to 
me. He was wearing an athletic jacket 
with the words “Bergen Catholic” 
on the back.
I wasn’t hurt by the contact. However, 
I do wonder about the satisfaction that 
the young man was getting out of delib­
erately bumping an elderly man—I am 
65 years old—who was standing on the 
walk praying. Contrast his action to 
that of one of the Pittsburgh Steelers 
who came by and respectfully inter­
rupted my prayers to ask me a question. 
I suggest that the latter deserves to be 
called a man, while the student, unfor­
tunately, has a lot to learn about being 
one.
Well, if you see that student on cam­
pus with his “Bergen Catholic” jacket 
on, please tell him that I prayed for him 
after he shouldered me. Perhaps some 
day he will look back on this day and this 
incident with a little regret, and I want 
him to know that I forgive him.

While I agree with 
James Stepanek and 
Seth Eliot that Matt 
Ball’s editorial [“NRA 
members have penis 
envy,"9/ 27] was “ludicrous, incoherent,, 
and obnoxious,” not to mention inflam­
matory, I’d like to present some argu­
ments against the “right to bear arms.”
The Supreme Court ruled on the Sec­
ond Amendment, “a well-regulated Mi­
litia, being necessary to the security of a: 
Free State, the right of the people to 
keep and bear Arms, shall not be in­
fringed,” in 1876,1886,1894, and 1934. 
In the last case, :,u, ”, 0gUUamw Justice 
James McReynolds wrote the opinion 
for the unanimous Supreme Court, and; 
stated unambiguously that citizens pos­
sess a constitutional right to bear arms 
only in connection with service in a mi­
litia. And when Morton Grove, Illinois, 
passed a law restricting the possession 
of handguns to police officers and prisons 
guards, the Supreme Court refused to 
hear an appeal of a lower court’s deci­
sion upholding this law.
About a year ago, Rodney Pearis killed 
a exchange student from Japan, Yoshi 
Hattori, because of a misunderstanding 
and the “right to bear arms.” The boy 
was going to a Halloween party with his 
host brother and went to the wrong 
address. Pearis’ wife went to the door 
and immediately shut it, calling her 
husband. Pearis came to the door with a, 
.44 magnum, and when Hattori took a' 
step toward him, not understanding the 
warnings, Pearis shot him in the chest. 
Pearis’ lawyer stated that, “in your house, 
if you want to do it, you have the legal 
right to answer everybody that comes to. 
your door with a gun.” Pearis didn’t need 
that magnum to protect himself. All he 
needed to do was close the door. Without 
a gun involved, Hattori would be alive 
today.
Think about this “right.” Even if the 
Second Amendment supported the right- 
to own guns for individual use and pro­
tection, it was written when state mili­
tias where commonly used in defense of 
the state. However, state militias have 
not been called to service since the faS
ignngni of the 19th century, and when 
the National Guard was recognized in 
1916 as the militia, there was no longer 
a need for state militias. In the 18^h

Pornography censors miss big picture
David Hunt
Just before his 1989 execution 
in Florida, Ted Bundy said that 
pornography was one of the fac- 
. tors that caused him to commit 
his heinous crimes. This renewed 
the firestorm of controversy about 
the societal value of pornography 
and censorship advocates from 
across the spectrum drooled at 
Bundy’s statement.
This controversy is not new. 
For years, radical feminists like 
Andrea Dworkin and Catherine 
MacKinnon have been pushing 
laws that try to curtail, if not stop 
outright, the production and sale 
of pornography.
Their argument is that the loss 
1 of a little freedom is outweighed 
[ by the gain of safety, and one of 
the great catch phrases is that 
erotica is OK, but pornography is 
bad.
We’ve now arrived at a quan­
dary: What ¿s pornography? What 
gy erotica? What gy obscene? Defi­
nitions of pornography vary from 
“nothing is obscene” to “anything 
that is exploitative of women.” 
c But Dworkin is so radical that 
' she believes consensual hetero­
sexual sex is a subjugation of 
women, and that even gay male
videos exploit women! How can 
we expect someone so obviously 
irrational to be mindful of trifling 
things like the Constitution?
Most of the women in porn are 
highly paid, and many are out­
spoken advocates of the indus­
try. Women, like pom star Nina 
Hartley, hardly seem exploited 
when they actively promote and 
protect their chosen careers.
Some pom stars have used their 
exposure in magazines and/or
movies as spring- --------
boards into the main­
stream movie or mod­
eling industries. Oth­
ers, having proven to 
themselves that they 
are pretty enough, fade 
back into relative ano- 
nymity.
If it arouses you, it’s erotica, 
but if it threatens someone, it”grUane pornography is the main 
must be pom. Well, W1a 7gfUa culprit, not mainstream porn 
threatens me. It is full of vio-* where the woman is a willing
mean you objectify them.
Sex and the biological goal of 
reproduction are fundamental 
drives.
Dworkin, MacKinnon, and com­
pany have joined with the reli­
gious right in an unholy alliance 
to monitor your thoughts and 
prevent you from seeing things 
they don’t think you should see. 
Only a year ago they tried to pass 
the Pornography Victims Com­
pensation Act, a law which would 
have allowed rape 
victims to sue the 
authors, publishers, 
and distributors of 
pornography for 
damages because 
porn allegedly 
played a role in their 
enough, the common thread to rape. Having failed on the fed- 
many of these studies shows that eral level, the anti-pom coalition
zine shut down for being obscene 
was one dedicated to radical les­
bian feminists. No matter how 
good the intentions, those in 
power will use censorship for then- 
own ends!
Advocates of pornography cen­
sorship have pointed to studies 
done that “prove” that pornogra­
phy promotes violence towards 
women.
But other, equally valid stud­
ies show it doesn’t. Strangely
No matter how good the inten­
tions, those in power will use 
censorship for their own ends!
lence, murder and, yes, pom! The 
Song of Songs is a very descrip­
tive poem about a man’s love and 
desire for a woman and her body. 
Exploitation! Objectification! Vic­
timization! Can I censor it, or 
prevent it from being published? 
Of course not, nor should I re­
strict access to it because I dis­
agree with it.
Canada passed alaw which had 
a great deal ofinput from Dworkin 
and MacKinnon. The first maga-
participant. Violence appears to 
be the key, not sex.
Some claim pornography 
makes sexual objects of women. 
For those who haven’t noticed, 
humans oma sexual beings. Men
has been trying to pass similar 
laws on the state level.
What this legislation would do 
is create a “Twinkie defense” for 
anyone accusedofrape. Forthose 
who don’t know the term, the 
murderer of a gay politician suc­
cessfully pleaded temporary in­
sanity from eating too many
think about sex a great deal of Twinkies. These bills, if passed,
the time, and from talking with 
female friends over the years I’d 
say the same is true for women. 
Just because you happened to 
notice the legs ofapassing woman 
or the ass of a passing man doesn’t
will turn every rapist into an 
automaton driven by pornogra­
phy, relieved of the responsibil­
ity for his actions — pom made 
him do it.
Using this argument, murder­
ers are driven to kill by movies 
and books. Would we for a mo­
ment consider allowing a mur­
derer to argue that his actions 
were caused by watching ugUan.a 
rp e1a loFfy ?
Rape is a horrible crime! How 
can we think of handing a pup- 
pet-on-a-string defense to some­
one who violates another human 
being’s rights?
Ultimately, the arguments 
come down to two basic points. 
The first is personal responsibil­
ity. People must be responsible 
for their actions. An idea can come 
from a book, but the action is 
done voluntarily by the person.
Second, freedom has a price. 
While I offer my sympathies to 
the victims of rape and fervently 
hope that as society advances the 
incidence falls, I cannot accept 
the censoring of expression, es­
pecially when the link between 
rape and pom is so tenuous. By 
protecting the rights of porn 
actors and makers, Iprotectmy 
own right to freely express 
myself.

century, our country was in an un­

to help defend the state and could not

There is no need for individual own­

ment agents would certainly have 
handguns. Also, illegally owned hand­
guns were once legally owned. If they 
are not put on the general market, they 
cannot reach the black market.
In the words of Rev. David Herndon 
of First Unitarian Church of Pitts­
burgh, “Let us never forget that guns 
don’t die — people do.”

Letter to the Editor
[“Column ignores important stats,” 
“Column full of malice for NRA,” 10/ 
4], It is always amazing to me to hear 
people who think that the NRA’s rabid 
and paranoid arguments against most 
any form of gun control make the
country a safer place. The idea that 
law-abiding citizens are protected by 
the NRA’s opposition to a waiting 
period on purchasing weapons or a 
law outlawing semi-automatics is lu­
dicrous.
For all the NRA’s statistics and ex­
cuses, few rational people would con­
tend that citizens of the United States, 
with easy and relatively unlimited 
access to guns, are safer than citizens 
of other countries.
Furthermore, what ecologist or con­
servationist has as their main tool a 
means of murder? Hunters don’t act 
like predators (except in their lack of 
ethical capability). Howmany of these 
great ecologists “harvest” the weak 
and sick of the herd instead of the 
strongest males?
Ball is accused of having lost touch 
with reality. It seems that Stepanek’s 
reality, like that of other hunters and 
gun “lovers,” is that of might makes 
right. Whatever is weaker is fair 
“game.” Whoever we are allowed to 
slaughter, we will.
If it is irrational and unrealistic for 
Ball to argue against violence, to speak 
on behalf of other beings unable to 
speak for themselves, and to work for 
a world based on respect and coexist­
ence instead of killing and machismo, 
then I want to live in his fantasy 
world. The vehemence with which the 
members of the NRA reacted against 
Ball’s column seems to reinforce his 
points.

US soldiers not innocent victims
Ameriean ‘ego’ clouds decision making
V —r'
The October 18 cover of WgFa Magazine 
is a photograph ofaU.S. soldier captured in 
Somalia, with the caption “What in the 
world are we doing?” I wonder, What in the 
world is t^ieir point?
I am not happy that a soldier has been 
taken hostage, nor that others have been 
killed in battle. I am constantly appalled at 
the level of violence of which human beings 
are capable. The amount of suffering we 
continually inflict, mindlessly or methodi­
cally, is numbing.
But these U.S. soldiers we moum cannot 
be termed innocent victims. These people 
voluntarily joined the armed forces, and we 
paid their salaries. There is more to main­
taining a military than taking taxpayers’ 
money for the training that taught these 
soldiers to be high-tech killers within the 
safety of U.S. borders. There are risks in­
volved in joining the military, just as there 
are risks in being a police officer or a fire 
fighter. The soldiers who shipped off to 
Somalia had no excuse not to understand 
these risks when they signed up.
It is not shocking that these servicemen 
have come under fire and been captured or 
killed; as cold as it may seem, it is part of 
their job. What is shocking is our narrow 
nationalism: one serviceman with cuts on 
his face, wishing for a pizza, and a plane 
ticket home, is cause for rage and ranting.
The rhetoric over our involvement in So­
malia has been set in terms of the safety of 
U.S. soldiers verses our pride and ego. It is
telling that the Somalis have been almost 
entirely forgotten. For every U.S. service- 
person who has died, how many Somalis 
have lived lives wretched and woeful far 
beyond our incognizant imagination, their 
only dissipation being death?
Our outrage is unbelievable, and would 
be amusing if not so sickly prejudiced. If our 
foreign policy was truly defined by a preju­
dice for protecting the lives of U.S. citizens, 
where was the outrage during the Gulf War, 
when U.S. troops were dying (ignoring the 
thousands of innocent Iraqis that were 
slaughtered)? What in the world were we 
doing then when our only goal was for the 
Emir of Kuwait to be returned to his golden 
toilet seat so his oppressive dictatorship 
could continue?
Yet instead of expressing revulsion at the 
slaughter in the Gulf region, we threw par­
ties of self-congratulation. Scores were dead, 
others homeless with their lives destroyed. 
Hussein was still in power reigning terror 
on the Kurds and Shi’ite Muslims. The only 
“positive” thing that came out of the war 
was the brief satiation of our immeasurable 
ego, bloodlust, and jingoism.
What is also beyond imagination would 
be a trace of truth in our place in the world. 
For example, it would be more honest for a 
cover of WgFa to have a two-part cover. One 
side would show huddled, starving chil­
dren. The opposite side would exhibit bloated 
U.S. citizens stuffing their faces with the 
flesh of an animal fed enough grain to nour­
ish dozens of Somalis. Then there would 
truly be cause to ask, “What in the world are 
we doing?”

The Economics of the Citibank
Classic Visa card. How Student Discounts and Price
Protection contribute to upward growth. A variety of factors have been
suggested as contributing to the economic growth of students, including (1) more lottery winners 
between the ages of 18 and 22, (2) a 37% increase on earnings from bottle and can returns, (3) more 
students doubling earnings in the lightning round of game shows, and (4) the Citibank Classic Visa® 
card. It’s this last one, however, that affects most students. H The Citibank Classic Visa card offers 
immediate savings to student cardmembers. You can save up to 26% on long distance calls versus AT&T 
with the free Citibank Calling Service”" from MCI.' And you can capitalize on a $20 Airfare Discount
for domestic flights.2 Savings on mail order pur­
chases, sports equipment, magazines and music 
also abound. Maximize these savings with a low 
variable interest rate of 15.4%3 and no annual fee, 
and you can significantly improve your personal

esponsibility for kids lies with parents, not television
/hm/¡rnoB ugni1oU
¡jn 1992, former Vice President Dan Quayle was 
reified by the national media for espousing a 
return to traditional family values. Over a year 
^ter, a 2-year-old girl is killed in a trailer fire 
jtjarted by her 5-year-old brother who was report- 
>^ly influenced by the MTV cartoon 7ao”gy onL 
KYgee1aoL,
¡What’s the connection? Itmay be a lack of “family 
>alues” that actually caused this tragedy, not a 
gnseless cartoon.
"g7ao”gy onL 7see1aoL might be the most-widely 
patched show on campus. Its characters and their 
^avoidable laugh are slowly crawling their way 
iijto the American mainstream, but their actions 
li the screen have raised many questions.
¡Part of the show that appeals to many viewers is 
Jie comically outrageous violence, such as one 
(laracter throwing a fork into the other’s eye. 
[Another common feature of the show is the char­
ters chanting “Fire! Fire!” and often playing with 
tjor other violent instruments, like chainsaws. 
[This is not to say that 7ao”gy onL 7see1aoLgy the 
Hly violent show on TV, nor am I even saying that 
.as the most violent. The problem arises, though, 
hen five-year-old children begin watching these
When I was a pre-schooler, my favorite TV shows 
”mamauayoFa uemaae onL0m, ¡riam[y dagi1frm1rrL, 
But I also liked cartoons like uhaaL ¡o.am because 
of the great number of car crashes in the show.
To say that television does not influence children 
today would be almost like saying the weather has 
no bearing on what you decide to wear.
Television has become part of our culture, and we
learn from it, but we must not ___________
let it control us.
Pre-schoolers don’t under­
stand that the “violence” in 
7ao”gy onL 7see1aoL is just an 
exaggeration drawn in order to 
make the scenes seem silly.
Also, the cartoon is filled with 
numerous sexual jokes that are 
way over the head of most American five-year-olds. 
But then, whose fault is it for allowing these 
children to watch the show? Is it MTVs, or is it 
someone closer to the children?
I believe that it is not MTV’s fault. Instead, it’s 
the fault of lazy and ignorant parents who are not 
aware of what their kids do and know. Quayle was 
the person who brought family values back to the 
forefront of political debate, and he and George 
Bush were correct in stating that many of the 
problems in America exist because of a breakdown 
in the home.
Parents should be responsible enough to know 
what their little children are watching on TV, 
because it is an undeniable influence on them.
If you were a parent, would you want your chil­
dren watching a show where the characters dis­
cuss “spanking the monkey” or speak casually 
about the evils of school?
Don’t you believe that these shows are sending 
the wrong message to children who have never 
been to school?
Many people will ask why we should allow MTV 
to show this kind of programming. In fact, when
[Quayle] and George Bush were correct in stat­
ing that many of the problems in America exist 
because of a breakdown in the home.
Congress holds hearings next week on violence on 
television, 7ao”gy onL 7see1aoL is expected to take 
center stage.
But MTV is a cable channel, not a free access 
station that can be picked up by anyone. It is one 
that parents can stop their kids from seeing.
I don’t believe in censorship, and that is why I 
believe that the network can broadcast anything 
they want to.
It may not be in the nation’s best interest, but it 
is not entirely the networks’ fault.
The blame should be placed directly on the par­
ents. Why is the television being allowed to act as 
a baby-sitter for these children?
Some will blame the economic policies of past 
presidents, but that’s all they are seeking to do —
find someone they can place blame on. Here, the 
same thing is happening: the larger problem of the 
breakdown of the family unit is being overshad­
owed by people trying to blame a cartoon show. The 
show may have some influence, but it is not the root 
cause ofthe demise of America’s communities. It is 
not the reason kids are out on the streets brandish­
ing weapons and committing senseless acts of
______________ violence. Yet, people try to find a
scapegoat, and this time it’s 
7ao”gy onL 7see1aoL,
I personally do not like the 
show, but I must admit that I do 
find parts of it amusing because 
ofthe total stupidity ofthe scenes. 
The problem is that not all small 
children can grasp this humor, 
nor is it aimed at them.
But it is not the fault of the network for putting 
out something that appeals to a certain age group, 
it’s the fault of the parents who allow their young 
children to watch these programs.
Censorship of television shows will not stop the 
violence in America’s streets. It may not even stop 
the lighting on fire of a trailer in Ohio.
To assume that television is the cause of our evil 
is naive. Instead, it’s time that parents begin to 
understand the responsibility that comes with 
children—and that Quayle was correct in citing a 
breakdown in family values as one of the biggest 
problems in our country today.
¡rnoB ugni1oU gy o pmay1Fon gn zCW,aising minimum wage will not solve employment problems
’oFay u, 7mrtn
.One of the many campaign 
jijomises Bill Clinton made was 
;oj raise the minimum wage. To 
surprise and chagrin, he may 
ujtually keep this promise.
¡His Labor Secretary, Robert 
RMch, last week announced his 
>lan to raise the minimum wage 
by 50 cents an hour. The proposal 
s» expected to go to Congress 
within the next week. Reich 
:l£imedthat theraise wouldhave 
i(j negative effect on employment 
njthis country.
it is unfortunate when a Presi- 
Idnt of the United States bases 
life .policies simply on the igno- 
ance of most Americans. It is 
itiiculous to believe that creat- 
a higher burden on employ- 
¡rp will not cause job loss. This is 
limply supply and demand. 
8p1oe I find even more offen­
ce are the reasons Clinton gives 
by supporting the minimum wage
ncrease. He claims that this will i . .ause every minimum wage re- 
i^iient to make more money, 
^{jparently, the employer will just 
upk up the cost from his own 
irivate wealth. The deception 
bejaind this is easily exposed. 
Raising the Tm'rnrmim wage will
cost jobs. Around 15 percent of 
Americans make minimum wage 
presently. These workers do not 
make minimum wage because
their employ- ________________
ers won’t pay 
them more..
They make 
minimum 
wage because 
they are worth 
no more than 
minimum wage.
If employers are so manipula­
tive, why doesn’t everyone make 
minimum wage? If minimum 
wage employees are worth more 
than minimum wage, why aren’t 
there other companies trying to 
hire them for more?
Seven percent of Americans are 
unemployed and looking for work. 
They cannot find it because they 
are not worth minimum wage.
If they were worth minimum 
wage, someone would have of­
fered them a job for minimum 
wage.
Why wouldn’t an employer of­
fer minimum wage to a person, if 
the employer stands to gain by it? 
There are certainly jobs avail­
able out there.
The minimum wage serves as a 
price floor for labor. It is above 
the equilibrium price for some 
people, and that’s why they are 
unemployed. If it is raised, it will 
be above the equilibrium price 
for even more people, and hence,
it will put more people out of 
work. Many of these borderline 
jobs are inner-city jobs for which 
minorities are hired. Thus, rais-
Around 15 percent of Americans ... 
make minimum wage because they are 
worth no more then minimum wage.
ing the minimum wage would 
put many more minorities on the 
welfare rolls.
Some may wonder why Clinton 
would want to do harm to the 
minority community. After all, 
isn’t he their candidate? Yes, but 
he is also the candidate of labor 
unions. In fact, he received a large
amount of campaign money from 
labor unions during his campaign.
Raising the minimum wage en­
hances the power of unions. The
_______________ reason is
simple: union 
workers are 
typically 
skilled at what 
they do. Their 
jobs do not, 
however, re­
quire high education.
So, any able bodied person could 
do a union worker’s job, but the 
union worker can do it faster. If a
union worker gets paid 10 dollars 
an hour and can do the same 
work three unskilled workers can 
do in the same time, the union 
worker is cheaper than those 
three workers.
After all, three workers would 
cost $12.75 at minimum wage. 
However, if there was no mini­
mum wage, the three unskilled 
workers could be hired instead. 
Then, the union worker would 
have to accept far lower wages or 
be out of a job. With the price
Given that seven percent of 
Americans are not even worth 
the minimum wage, plus the fact 
that Clinton is going to cost people 
jobs with socialized health care,

Building Democracy for 
a New El Salvador
The most significant elections in the history of El Salvador will take place on March 20,1994.
In these elections, the first to occur since peace accords were signed in 1992, the people of 
El Salvador will determine a new president, a new national assembly, and new municipal governments.
The Salvadoran opposition, led by the FMLN (Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front), 
fought for 12 years to win the right to change their social system peacefully. The FMLN, the Melida 
Anaya Montes Women's Movement (MAM), and the popular opposition will use these elections to 
advance their revolutionary platform. Women, who make up 52% of the Salvadoran population, have 
played a critical role in formulating this platform and will be key in the elections as voters and as 
candidates.

Tartan football blows Chicago away
by RICH KWIATKOWSKI
Womeon ueopptmgeam
The Carnegie Mellon Tartans traveled to the 
University of Chicago this past weekend and came 
home with a 45—14 victory. This win moves the 
Tartans to 5-2 overall and 3-0 in UAA play. The 
Tartan offense, with a balanced air and ground 
attack, gained 428 total yards and pushed the ball 
over the goal line six times. Senior halfback Brain 
Horton scored three touchdowns, while sophomore 
tight end Aaron Neal caught eight passes, two for 
touchdowns. The final touchdown was scored by 
junior halfback Nick Bush on a 23-yard touchdown 
scramble.
The Tartan defense was equally impressive, get­
ting back to traditional Tartan form. The defense, 
led by junior defensive back Joe Ferris, senior 
inside linebacker Chad Wilson and senior inside 
linebacker Jeff Blue, held the Maroons tp only 276 
total yards, well below their season average of 366 
yards per game. The Tartans also held Chicago 
below their NCAA division III leading 351.3 rush­
ing yards per game, allowing just 263 yards rush­
ing.
Most impressive was how the defense contained 
All-American senior fullback Frank Baker. Last 
week Baker earned UAA Offensive Athlete of the 
Week following his 231-yard performance against 
Drake University. Baker has also rushed for over 
100-yards the past seven games and has rushed for 
over 1000-yards forthe third straight season. Baker 
gained 147-yards on 28 carries, but never stung the 
Tartans on any one rush.
“The kids picked it up after two losses,” said 
Defensive Coordinator Terry Bodnar. “They con­
tained the leading [Division III] rushing team in 
the country. We worked in practice to stop the 
quarterback option, and it paid off.”
“Chicago has an excellent team, much improved
from last season,” said Head Coach Rich Lackner. 
“Our team has character and a lot of guts. It was a 
great game on both sides.”
The Tartans took the opening kickoff and engi­
neered a 60-yard touchdown drive. The Tartans 
pounded the ball up the middle, using the usual 
tandem of Horton and junior halfback Jason 
Grusky. Grusky led the Tartan ground attack with 
13 carries for 93-yards. Grusky sparked the open-
tan drives and setting up Horton’s three touch­
down runs.
CMU was forced to punt and Chicago took over 
on their own 32 yardline, after a 32-yard punt by 
senior John Knutson. Chicago kept the ball on the 
ground, but surprised the Tartan defense on first 
and 10 from the Tartan 43 yardline, when senior 
quarterback Joseph McCoy attempted a pass. Up 
to this point in the season McCoy completed only
‘The kids picked it up after two losses...They contained 
the leading [Division III] rushing team in the country. We 
worked in practice to stop the quarterback option, and it 
paid off.”
— Defensive Coordinator Terry Bodnar
ing drive with a 14-yard rush to the Maroon four 
yardline. Two plays later, Horton powered the ball 
up the middle on a one-yard touchdown run. Senior 
placekicker Fred Harding added the extra point 
and the Tartans took an early 7-0 lead.
Chicago used a no-huddle offense on their first 
possession, but could not confuse the Tartan de­
fense. Wilson and Blue combined on a tackle for a 
loss of 4-yards which forced the Maroons to punt.
CMU took over the ball on their own 29 yardline, 
but stalled after junior quarterback Chris Dee was 
sacked twice and had a pass blocked. This drive 
saw the role of sophomore halfback Mike Mathias 
expand. Mathias caught an 18-yard pass to keep 
the drive alive on third down and 14. Mathias 
rushed for 56 yards on 10 carries, most on sweeps 
to the right, and caught four passes for 37 yards. 
Mathias was responsible for sustaining many Tar-
seven passes on 39 attempts for an average of 14.8 
passing yards per game. The play was designed to 
keep the Tartans off-balance. The Maroon drive 
stalled on this series; they appeared to be going for 
the first down on fourth and seven from the CMU 
40 yardline. McCoy pitched the ball to junior Chris 
Doyle, who instead of running quick punted the 
ball into the endzone.
CMU and Chicago traded punts and the Tartans 
took over the ball on their own 45 yardline. The 
good field position was set up by an interference 
call against Chicago on the punt reception. Tartan 
sophomore Rob Locke was hit before he had a 
chance to catch the punt. CMU took advantage of 
the field position when Dee hit Neal for screen pass 
that went for 42-yards, following excellent downfield 
blocking. The Tartans kept the ball on the ground, 
utilizing Horton, Grusky, and Mathias, until the
drive went to third and goal from the Chicago six 
yardline. Dee took the snap, rolled left, and hit 
Neal for his second reception and first touchdown 
catch for six-yards, capping a 65-yard drive. CMU 
led 14-0.
Neal had an active day. He caught eight passes 
for 101 yards, two for touchdowns.
Chicago took the ball on their own 34 yardline 
after the kickoff. They moved the ball 40 yards to 
the CMU 26 yardline, where they opted to attempt 
a first down attempt on fourth and six. McCoy 
optioned to baker who was stopped by Wilson and 
sophomore defensive back Avinash Barat for a 2- 
yard loss. Barat played well and registered nine 
tackles.
Carnegie Mellon was forced to punt on their 
ensuing drive. Knutson got off a high 40-yard punt. 
Sophomore outside linebacker Ray Lewis made a 
great tackle to hold the Maroons to only a one-yard 
return.
Chicago took the ball on their own 21 yardline 
and McCoy completed a 15-yard pass to his junior 
tight end Gavin Bradley. Baker and McCoy traded 
running plays until McCoy kept the ball and 
scrambled for a nine-yard touchdown rush. The 
Maroons added the extra point and trailed 14—7.
“Their first touchdown used the outside toss 
sweep. We had not looked at it much, they only ran 
it two toss sweeps this season, so we did not 
emphasize it,” said Bodnar.
CMU answered the Chicago score in their third 
touchdown, with 36 seconds left in the second 
quarter. The touchdown drive was spurred by 
Grusky’s 34-yard rush, his longest from scrim­
mage this season. Grusky carried the ball three 
more times and brought the Tartans to the Chicago 
four yardline, where Dee threw his second touch­
down pass to Neal. CMU took a 21-7 lead into 
halftime.

After yesterday’s commanding 7-0 defeat of 
Oberlin College, the Tartan women’s soccer team 
now owns a 10-2—1 record. The 10 wins ties a 
school reord.
Leading the Tartans’ victory Sunday were sopho­
more forward Nicole Poisson and freshman 
midfielder Alyssa Newman, who each scored two 
goals.
Senior midfielder Diantha Korzun and sopho­
mores Bridget Caster, a stopper and midfielder 
Maria Casella each added one goal. Freshman 
goalkeepers Jill Weber and Katherine Morrison 
shared the shutout.
Afterlosing to Emory University 2-0 on October 
3, the team has reeled off five straight victories. 
The contests were all non-league matchups, so the 
team’sUAA record still stands at 1—2, good for fifth 
place.

The string of victories started on October 6 with 
a 2-0 win over Washington & Jefferson College. 
Caster and freshman midfielder Jill Sincaglia 
scored the two Tartan goals.
The team then traveled to Virginia and Mary­
land to battle Marymount University and Goucher 
College. Junior defender Christina Isaly was the 
hero in a 1-0 win over Marymount. Weber recorded 
her fifth shutout of the season.
At Goucher, the team pulled out a 5-2 victory. 
Casella tallied two goals, while Newman, fresh­
man midfielder Mae Hogan and senior co-captain 
Rachel Bourn, a forward each added one goal.
The team returned to Carnegie Mellon to take on 
Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania last Fri­
day. The Tartans soundly won, Jm90.
Scoring was spread between Hogan, Casella, 
Poisson and Isaly, while Weber and Morrison shared 
the shutout.
The team begins a three game homestand on 
Wednesday, when Bethany College comes to 
Gesling Stadium. This weekend promises a big 
UAA matchu when Rochester and Brandeis come 
to Gesling Stadium.
The Tartans then go on the road for a non­
conference game at Grove City College.
The team’s final game is at home on October 30 
when the Maroons from the University of Chicago 
come to CMU.
With one win and two losses in the UAA, the 
team faces a tough uphill climb to contend for the 
title.
That can’t overshadow the very impressive re­
sults the team has had this season.
Very few members of the soccer team are seniors, 
so there promises to be some strong performances 
from the team in the years to come.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer team contin­
ued its quest for an NCAA playoff berth, going 3-
0-1 in its last four games, with the lone blemish a 
tie against Division I foe the University of Pitts­
burgh.
Since the team’s first loss after a 7-0-0 start, 
October 3 against Emory University, the Tartans 
defeated Westminster College on October 6, 2-0, 
Franklin & Marshall College on October 9, 2-0, 
tied Pitt on Wednesday, 1—1, and defeated Penn 
State-Behrend College on Saturday, 5-0.
The team is now 10-1-1 on the season, 3-1-0 in 
the UAA, and was 17th in Division III in the last 
poll. They end their season with five consecutive 
home games — three of them UAA contests — 
beginning Tuesday against Grove City College.
“We’re 17th right now, and the tie against Pitt 
didn’t hurt us any,” head coach Nick Gaudioso said. 
“We’ll have to see what we do this week. This 
weekend is going to show a lot. We have two really 
big games [against the University of Rochester and 
Brandeis University, two UAA foes], two like 
Emory. I think our whole season pretty much 
depends on what happens this weekend.”
“I think [junior midfielder] Chuck Kuba, who’s 
come in and replaced [injured freshman] Tommy 
Layton, is starting to come on,” Gaudioso said. “I 
think everybody else has sharpened up, and 
everybody’s over the little injuries. I think we’re 
almost at the level where we can play, and I hope 
we can maintain it. What I’ve been telling the kids 
is don’t look ahead and take each game on at a 
time.”
Saturday, senior forward Alex Amezquita and 
senior midfielder Pat Lucignani scored two goals 
apiece, and junior midfielder Jeff McJunkin added 
another as the Tartans rolled past Penn State-

Behrend. In goal, seniors David Shapiro and Dan 
Warren, and sophomore John Moran shared the 
shutout.
In the Westminster game, Kuba and senior 
midfielder Mike Brazinski scored the goals, while 
Shapiro picked up the shutout. Against F&M, 
Brazinski scored again, and was joined in the 
scoring column by junior midfielder Vince Russell.
Sophomore defender Alan Levin and McJunkin 
had the assists, and Shapiro again recorded the 
shutouts.
Brazinski scored the Tartans’ lone goal against 
Pitt, who scored on a fluke goal for the tie. The goal 
the Panthers scored was only the fourth allowed by 
the Tartans this year, with two of those coming in 
the 2-0 loss to Emory and one in the 3-1 win over 
Washington University of St. Louis.
This week CMU begins a five game homestand to 
end the season. They go against Grove City on the 
19th be for e taking on two UAA rivals. Rochester 
and Brandeis come to Gesling Stadium next week­
end.

Tigers claw victory away from Tartans
Tartans suffer second loss of the season, Trinity University revenges last year’s defeat
3y RICH KWIATKOWSKI
Womeon ueopptmgeam
The Tartans suffered their second loss, 
¡0-29, last Saturday to the Trinity Uni­
versity Tigers. The Tigers avenged last 
gear’s loss to the Tartans at San Anto- 
ijb, 42-17. This game saw the lead 
:liange hands four times. Trinity finally 
leld on to it with 2:44 left in the game. 
The loss virtually wiped out any play- 
>ff hope for the Tartans. After the Al- 
egheny loss on October 2, the Tartans 
Iropped from first to fifth place in the 
South Regional rankings. The Tartans 
yould have to have gone undefeated, 
Including a tough game against Grove 
Sty College to make it to the playoffs. 
“The game was ours to take and we 
rave it up. We had mental break downs, 
lenalties, interceptions and were shut 
iut in the fourth quarter. It was an 
mproved Trinity team, but we were 
«rrible. The playoffs are out of reach,” 
laid head coach Rich Lackner.
Carnegie Mellon looked impressive in 
;he first quarter. Senior inside linebacker 
Jeff Blue recovered a Trinity fumble on 
,heir second play from scrimmage. CMU 
ook over the ball on the Trinity 16 
hardline. Carnegie Mellon capitalized 
hree plays later with a 32-yard field 
¡oal by senior placekicker Fred Harding. 
Trinity gave up the ball on their next 
wo possessions. Junior free safety Joe
Ferris intercepted Trinity junior quar­
terback Arbra Bailey at the CMU 42 
yardline. The Tartan offense could not 
turn the good field position into points.
Bailey’s second interception was taken 
by sophomore defensive back Rob Locke. 
Locke intercepted the ball on the CMU 
37 yardline and returned the ball to 
midfield. The Tartan offense used the 
air and the ground to set up a three-yard 
touchdown run by junior halfback Jason 
Grusky. Harding added the extra point 
and CMU seemed to be rolling with a 
10-0 lead.
Grusky led the Tartan ground game 
with 14 attempts for 65 yards. Senior 
fullback Brian Horton carried the ball 
12 times and gained 37 yards, while 
junior quarterback Chris Dee rushed for 
23 yards on 10 carries.
Trinity’s first score came off of Dee’s 
first interception. The Tartans were driv­
ing when Dee was intercepted by Trinity 
junior defensive back Eric Phifer on the 
CMU 33 yardline. Phifer ran the inter­
ception into the endzone for Trinity’s 
first score. The interception cut CMU’s 
lead to 10-7.
The Tigers took over the lead on their 
next possession. Trinity drove the ball 
46 yards on eight plays, before Bailey 
scored on a 13-yard touchdown rush and 
gave the Tigers a 14—10 lead.
The Tigers moved the ball well against 
the Tartans. The Tartan defense was
allowing only 115.4 yards per game on 
the ground. The Tigers rushed for 158 
ground yards and threw for 143 yards, 
for a total of 301 yards. The Tartans 
offense ran and threw for 322 yards, but 
was plagued by five interceptions (four 
by Dee and one by Grusky).
The Tartans were also hampered by 
10 penalties, for90yards, and they made 
only one third down conversion all game. 
The Tartan offense only held the ball for 
24:12 during the game.
The Tartans took over the ball on their 
own 20 yardline after Trinity punted 
into the endzone. They used the clock 
well and went 80 yards in 12 plays using 
3:16 to score. The Tartans drove to the 
Trinity 10 yard line where they were 
faced with third down and goal. Dee 
completed a screen pass to junior half­
back Nick Bush for a nine yard gain. The 
Tartans elected to go for the touchdown 
on fourth and goal from the one yardline. 
The ball was given to Horton, who bulled 
through the middle, and gave the lead 
back to Carnegie Mellon, 16-14 and 
brought the end to the first half.
The Tartans received the ball at the 
start of the second half and increased 
their lead on a perfect pass from Dee to 
senior wide receiver Jarrod Siket for a 
63-yard touchdown reception.
Harding added the extra point and 
the Tartans seemed to have a comfort­
able 23-14 lead.
“We were experiencing a man-to-man 
coverage. I came split out wide and was 
able to beat my man coverage. The first 
pass went for the touchdown, and then 
we went back to it. If you give Chris time 
he is hard to stop,” said Siket.
Trinity answered Carnegie Mellon’s 
touchdown with a field goal on their 
series. The Tigers drove the ball 56 yards 
on 11 plays and capped it off with a 42- 
yard field goal, to make the score 23-17. 
The CMU defense came through to halt 
the Tiger drive and only allow the three 
points. Tartan junior defensive tackle 
Merle Atkinson blocked a pass, and two 
plays later senior inside linebacker Chad 
Wilson broke up a pass to stall the drive.
The Tartans were forced to punt on 
their next drive, but the defense held 
strong and forced Trinity to punt from 
the Carnegie Mellon 45 yardline. Tar­
tan freshman inside linebacker Ray 
Ardire broke through the line untouched 
and recorded his second blocked punt of 
the season. Ardire picked up the ball 
and returned the blocked punt to the 
Trinity 20 yard line.
The Tartan offense could not capital­
ize on the excellent field position and 
were forced to try a field goal. The field 
goal wouldhave been a37-yard attempt, 
but the Tartans opted for a fake field 
goal. The ball was pitched to Grusky 
who aired the ball into the endzone, but 
it was intercepted on the 12 yardline by
senior middle linebacker David Trainer. 
This decision would be the difference in 
the game.
The Tartans once again took over the 
ball after the defense held Trinity to 
only fouryards. CMU took control on the 
Tigers’ 38 yard line at the beginning of 
the fourth quarter. On the second play, 
Dee went to his favorite target, Siket, for 
a 34-yard touchdown pass. The Tartans 
took a commanding lead 29-17.
For the game, Siket caught only two 
passes, bothfortouchdowns,for 97yards. 
Dee hit Grusky four times for 43 yards. 
He also threw to sophomore tight end 
Aaron Neal and senior wide receiver 
Andy Van Sprang once and Nick Bush 
twice.
Trinity answered the CMU score with 
two touchdowns. The first touchdown 
was a 68-yard drive on 13 plays to cut 
the lead to six. The second Trinity touch­
down was set up by Dee’s third intercep­
tion of the day which gave Trinity the 
ball on the CMU 30 yard line.
Five minutes later the Tigers scored 
their second touchdown of the fourth 
quarter and took the lead 30-29.
CMU could not score again despite 
two possessions in the last 2:38 of the 
game. The first drive ended on Dee’s 
fourth interception—by freshman line­
backer John Beckwith—and the second 
series stalled on a fourth down sack by 
senior defensive lineman John Tobola.
Volleyball team showing great improvement
By RAMSEY HONG
Womeon Ome PLgerm
The Tartans hoped their play would improve, and it did, leading 
them to several victories in recent matches.
Last Tuesday they played and won against the University of 
Steubenville and Chatham College in a tri-match. The final 
scores of the matches were the University of Steubenville, 15-10, 
15-13, and Chatham College, 15-9,17-15.
Junior Jennifer Goetz said, “We had to do it. We can win, we just 
don’t realize what kind of advantage we do have and we just let 
ourselves emotionally get down.”
They also won their Thursday match against the Bethany 
College Bisons. The very first game showed that the Tartans were 
going to try and keep their winning streak going. At one point in 
the first game the Tartans had a 13-8 lead over the Bethany 
Bisons, but due to some strong serving by the Bisons the Tartans 
lost the first game. Fortunately, they improved their serve rerieves
and went on to beat the Bisons in the next three games.
The high spirits at the Bethany match could be felt through 
something coach Heather Hollands said during a particularly 
impromptu but successful play aided by freshman Sarah Pacocha: 
“Sarah, I have just one question, what was that?”
Unfortunately, the Green Terror’s annual tournament at West­
ern Maryland College in Westminster was not the success that it 
might have been. The Tartans played in Pool B against Franklin & 
Marshall, Mary Washington, Salisbury State, Seton Hill, and 
York. The Tartans played competitively, but they lost all their 
matches.
On Thursday, October 21 the Tartans play their final home 
match against Washington & Jefferson College at 7pm. After that 
there is going to be a match at Carlow College on Saturday, October 
23 at noon and then the following Tuesday there is a mtach at 
Bethany College on Tuesday, October 26 at 7pm. To end their 
season the Tartans play at the University Athletic Association 
Championships at the Uiversity of Rochester October 29-31.

Tartans defeat 
Chicago, 3-0 in UAA
IeeN¡wkkt MyCl 0u­s bb
Dee returned to his pre-Allegh­
eny form at Chicago. Dee com­
pleted 15 out of 20 passes for 185 
yards and two touchdown passes. 
Most telling was that Dee threw 
no interceptions after being 
picked off eight times in his two 
previous starts.
“[The Allegheny and Trinity 
games] were not confidence prob­
lems. I don’t know what it was 
said Dee. “I thought I was ready 
for Allegheny and Trinity. The 
line gave me time today and I was 
able to make good decisions.”
“Chris made excellent decisions 
today. He had an exceptionally 
fine game,” said Lackner.
Chicago received the ball first 
in the second half and was forced 
to punt after three plays. The 
Tartans took over on their own
23 yardline. Mathias bolstered 
the drive with a three-yard, sec­
ond effort rush for a first down. 
Dee fumbled the slick ball from 
center, on the next play, and 
Maroon freshman Tucker 
Morrison recovered.
Chicago took advantage of the 
Tartan turnover and needed only 
three plays to drive the ball 34 
yards for their second touchdown. 
Baker took the ball up the middle, 
broke two tackles, and bulled his 
way into the endzone. The Ma­
roons added the extra point and 
closed the gap to 21-14.
The Tartans responded to the 
Chicago score with a 36-yard field 
goal from Harding. The Tartans 
had excellent field position once 
again, after senior wide receiver 
Jarrod Siket took the kickoff for a 
25-yardretum. CMU stayed with 
the triple attack of Horton, 
Grusky, and Mathias, with Neal 
adding an 11-yard drive sustain­
ing catch. The drive stopped on 
the Chicago 19 yardline with an 
incomplete pass to Mathias. 
Harding added the field goal with 
6:30 left in the third quarter and 
the Tartans increased their lead 
24-14.
Chicago returned to the option 
one too many times when McCoy 
fumbled a pitch to Baker on the 
Chicago 47 yardline. The ball was 
recovered by Barat. The Maroons 
had some momentum going into 
this drive, but the fumble dealt 
the final blow.
The Tartan offense took no time 
to march the ball 37 yards and 
culminated with Horton’s second 
touchdown run. The route was on 
as Carnegie Mellon took a com­
manding 31-14 lead.
Chicago received the ball to
start the fourth quarter. On the 
second play of the series Baker 
was sidelined by a monster hit 
from sophomore defensive back 
Rob Locke. Baker was taken out 
for a few plays and diagnosed 
with a broken nose.
Chicago continued to move the 
ball well. McCoy and Baker com­
bined to move the ball to the CMU 
nine yardline and set up a first 
and goal. A holding penalty and 
an illegal procedure call moved 
the Maroons back to the CMU 30 
yardhne. The defense held strong, 
holding Chicago to only seven 
yards, where the Maroons were 
faced with a fourth and goal on 
the CMU 23 yardline. Chicago 
decided to run the bootleg, but 
McCoy slipped on the wet field 
and was down for a four-yard 
loss.
CMU came out throwing on 
their next possession. Dee com­
pleted passes to Neal, Siket, and 
senior wide receiver Andy Van 
Sprang. The Tartans drove the 
ball to the Chicago one yardhne 
where Horton scored his third 
touchdown, and gave the Tar­
tans a 38-14 lead.
“Anybody can score from the 
one yardline,” said Horton. “The 
line played a great game. This 
was a team win.”
Chicago had all but lost hope 
and had to punt as the Tartan 
defense held strong and let noth­
ing get by. CMU took the ball on 
the Chicago 45 yardline, andused 
the opportunity of the large lead 
to give the second offense valu­
able playing time.
Junior quarterback Matt Neiss 
led the offense with sophomore 
Tony Babeo, sophomore fullback 
Lee Anton, sophomore fullback 
David Saylor, and Bush all get­
ting a chance to move the ball.
The second team looked im­
pressive moving the ball 45 yards 
for the sixth CMU touchdown. 
Bush found a wide open hole on 
second and 10 and rushed for a 23 
yard touchdown. Harding added 
the point after for the final score 
of 45-14.
Harding was perfect on the day. 
He totaled nine points; six extra 
points, and one field goal.
The Tartans have the week off, 
then travel to Grove City to play 
a surprising Wolverine team on 
October 30.
The Tartans then return home 
for two home games against 
Catholic University on Novem­
ber 6, and UAA rival Case West­
ern Reserve to finish out the regu­
lar season on the 13th.

Vancouver team to beat in Pacific Division
The Puck Stops Here
by Allan Bourdius
The Pacific Division is notable this season because three of the six 
teams in the field could be categorized as pathetic. Wayne Gretzky 
once characterized the New Jersey Devils as a “Mickey Mouse 
organization.” Well, perhaps Gretzky wasn’t right about the Devils, 
but Mickey has sure landed full force in the Pacific (along with Goofy, 
Donald, and Minnie) in the form of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.
The Vancouver Canucks will probably win the division, given the 
offensive talents of Pavel Bure, Trevor Linden, Cliff Ronning, Geoff 
Courtnall, and Petr Nedved. The Canucks have a fine defense 
centered around Dave Babych, Gerald Diduck, and Jyrki Lumme, 
but are lacking offensive power back on the blue line. Kirk McLean 
is a standout in goal; the only reason he isn’t referred to as a 
superstar is Vancouver’s poor playoff showings.
If Gretzky’s Los Angeles Kings are going to make another run at 
Lord Stanley’s cup, they have to stay healthy. Many of their key 
players (Gretzky, Tomas Sandstrom, and Tony Granato) are far too 
injury-prone. The Kings made perhaps the best trade of the off­
season, acquiring up-and-coming center Shawn McEachem from 
the Penguins for bruiser Marty McSorley. While McEachem won’t 
be the next Gretzky, the ex-Olympian certainly will profit from The 
GreatOne’s leadership. Luc Robitaille should have another excel­
lent season. Sixty goals or more shouldn’t be a problem for the flashy 
left winger. The Kings’ hidden strength is in their young defense, 
particularly Alexei Zhitnik and Rob Blake. Look for these two to 
increase their offensive numbers as well as to not allow attackers 
much breathing room in the defensive zone.
The Calgary Flames are good enough to finish third in the division, 
but they probably won’t do much in the playoffs. The team has a great 
offensive core consisting of forwards Theoren Fleury, Robert Reichel, 
Gary Roberts, and Joe Nieuwendyk and defensemen Gary Suter and 
A1 Maclnnis. Unfortunately for the Flames, after Suter and Maclnnis, 
they don’t really have any other standout defensemen, either offen­
sively or defensively. The Flames’ defense, particularly penalty 
killing, began to look even bleaker when Brian Skrudland was 
picked by the Florida Panthers in the expansion draft. Joel Otto
leads the checking forwards, but he can’t be expected to do the job 
alone. Mike Vernon’s days as the starting goalie could be numbered. 
The Flames have two fine goal tending prospects in Trevor Kidd and 
Andrei Trefilov.
Now we come to the bottom of the barrel: the San Jose Sharks, 
Edmonton Oilers, and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. I’m going to go 
out on a limb here and say that the Sharks are going to finish fourth, 
and might even make the playoffs. Key to the Sharks’ success are two 
young players and two old ones. The two key youths are Pat Falloon 
and rookie Viktor Kolzov. Falloon needs to stay healthy and produce. 
He is easily capable of a 50-goal season. Kolzovis a bit of an unknown 
factor. He was San Jose’s number one draft pick this year. His 
skating and stick handling are excellent. The only question is how 
well will he adapt to the NHL. The two older players are Igor 
Larionov and Sergei Makarov. This pair comprises two-thirds of the 
famed “KLM” line of the Soviet national team. From 1982—1989, 
Makarov and Larionov (along with left wing Viktor Krutov) made up 
the best forward line in international hockey. They should also have 
an important effect on Kolzov, since the Russian rookie now gets the 
chance to play with his childhood idols.
The Edmonton Oilers are a far cry from the team they once were, 
and there’s nobody to blame but owner Peter Pocklington. In many 
ways, Pocklington is the George Steinbrenner of the NHL. Instead 
of paying his top veteran players competitive salaries, he has lost 
them to free agency or trades for questionable rookies or draft picks. 
The three first-round picks the Oilers got in the Wayne Gretzky 
trade have yet to yield a star player, or even one who has been a 
consistent member of the team. The team’s offense relies on has- 
beens or underachievers like Doug Weight, Shayne Corson, Kevin 
Todd, and Zdeno Ciger. Defenseman Dave Manson and goaltender 
Bill Ranford are both excellent players, which of course means that 
Pocklington will probably deal them rather than pay them.
The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim play in an arena nicknamed “the 
Pond,” they have between-period skating cheerleaders called “the 
Decoys,” and are basically guaranteed to get the number one pick in 
the next four or five entry drafts. The Ducks made some pretty 
curious choices during the expansion draft. The best player they 
selected was center Terry Yake, who had a career season in 92—93 
when he scored all of 22 goals for the Hartford Whalers. There is 
some hope back on the blue line, however. Alexei Kasatonov and 
Randy Ladouceur are both solid. The Ducks’ real chances lie in their 
prospects. If rookies Jarrod Skalde, Paul Kariya, and Valeri Karpov 
can all contribute as their pre-NHL performances suggest, then 
perhaps there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.
On the Pittsburgh Home front, the Penguins are struggling and 
Mario Lemieux is still sitting on the sidelines. Both of the Penguins’ 
power forwards, Kevin Stevens and Rick Tocchet, have just one goalBeer commercials and the World Series

Yes, baseball fans, it’s that time 
of year again! Time to break out 
the chips and pretzels, to glue the 
remote to your hand, and kick 
back for up to seven fun-filled 
evenings of beer commercials — 
with a few innings of World Se­
ries play here and there.
It’s once again mid-October, and 
the nation’s couch potato popula­
tion is taking its yearly jump. All 
over the country people are out 
there vegetating in the name of 
athletics.
Around the world, spudding 
will be at an all-time high as 103 
countries receive the World Se­
ries telecast this year. Toronto 
and Philadelphia are expected to 
be the hardest-hit this season by
the epidemic.
The Blue Jays looked pretty 
good during the playoffs, but be­
ing the Orioles fan that I am, I 
hesitate to say that it was be­
cause they actually played well. I 
think it’s more because the White 
Sox looked like they were trying 
to beat the world record for most 
errors during a professional 
sports event. The last playoff 
game might have gone differently 
if the Sox hadn’t let the Jays go 
ahead from a 2-2 tie in the fourth 
inning on a couple of poorly-timed
you-get-it” ball by the Sox’s out­
field, Chicago might have had a 
chance.
On the National League side of 
things, the Phillies closed out the 
Braves four games to two to grab 
the NL Championship last 
Wednesday. With no really out­
standing, league-leading players, 
the Phillies are held together by 
teamwork. A team can’t lead its 
division for almost the entire sea­
son without it, and Philadelphia 
seems to have more than their 
share.

While it might not be in the Pens best interest to gamble 
Lemieux’s health, one of the recent expansion teams would probabl 
jump at the chance to get him at the cost of a few first and s

to that of Islanders great and Hall of Famer Mike Bossy. Just fa 
years after a serious back injury, Bossy was out of the le 
Perhaps Lemieux would be wise to take the Michael Jordan route 
and retire now while he’s at the top of his game. Lemieux’s careert 
date — 477 goals (23rd all time,seventh among actives), 697 a 
(24th all time, eighth active), two time Hart Trophy Winner (MVp 
four time Art Ross Trophy Winner (leading scorer) — would 
find him a place in the Hall of Fame.
In other NHL news, the league has begun a big crackdown in on 
ice violence. So far, two suspensions have been handed down—m0i 
importantly to Chicago’s Chris Chelios, who for now is suspend 
indefinitely for an altercation that resulted in 37 minutes in pena 
ties given to him alone. This will definitely be the year of ^ 
suspension. Dale Hunter, the heart and soul of the Washing^ 
Capitals, was lost to a 21-game suspension before the season t 
Hunter’s absence has much to do with the fact that the Caps areti
6 as of Friday night.
Also as of Friday night, the Flames, Maple Leafs, and Devils ar 
the only remaining unbeaten teams. The Pittsburgh Penguins ar 
the biggest disappointment so far. They managed to beat the Florid 
Panthers only by a fluke goal and their loss to the Tampa 
Lightning was simply embarrassing. The Hartford Whalers areal): 
surprise. After dropping their first two matches, they rebounde 
and are now on a three-game winning streak.
Gretzky and Toronto’s Doug Gilmour are currently tied for th 
league lead in scoring (as of Friday) with 13 points. Pittsburgh' 
Martin Straka is the leading goal scorer with six.
Finally, here are my predictions for the playoffs. In the Easter: 
Conference, Montreal defeats the New Jersey Devils in overtimeo 
game seven of a hard-fought series. The Western Conference ( 
pions will be the Toronto Maple Leafs, who will beat the Los Angele 
Kings in five games. Montreal will then defend their Stanley Cuj 
championship, disposing of the Leafs in six.
Next week: a look at some of the more improved players in th 
league and the top rookies.

Congressman Curt Weldon have

since the purchase of Manhattan

I won’t tell you who I think will

Phillies fans enjoy fall season for a change
The Suicide Squeeze
byAnuj Gupta
October... to some just another month 
of the year, but for others, the greatest 
month of the year. It is the time when 
the air is filled with the sweet smell of 
burning leaves, a time when the Hallow­
een spirit in all of us comes out, and of 
course a time when the crack of the bat 
hitting the ball is amplified at an all- 
time high. Yes, baseball fans, it is World 
Series time once again, and what a se- 
riesl993has brought the baseball world. 
It is a series pitting the arrogance and 
flashiness of the Toronto Blue Jays ver­
sus the grunge and grind of the Philadel­
phia Phillies.
October has never failed to bring real 
life drama to the fans and this October 
will be no different. Already, this 
postseason has brought baseball fans to 
the pinncale of excitement and that was 
just a taste of what is to come. Expect the 
same from this World Series, for not 
only will the country see the two best 
offenses in baseball go at each other, but 
will also view two pitching staffs that 
could not have come through any better 
in the clutch, e.g. Toronto’s Dave Stewart 
and Juan Guzman and Philadelphia’s 
Curt Schilling, Danny Jackson, and 
Tommy Greene. Add to that the fact that 
certain key players such as the Phillies’ 
Darren Daulton and Dave Hollins, and 
the Blue Jays’ Rickey Henderson have 
yet to perform up to potential and one 
has the makings for a great series.
Although most would consider the 
Phillies the underdog, one has to realize 
that for all their weaknessess (bad de­
fense, inconsistent bullpen, lack of 
speed), they are facing an all right handed 
pitching staff, and it is safe to say that 
the Phillies are the best left handed 
hitting lineup in the majors. Of course 
the Blue Jays will definitely capitalize 
on the fact that Philly pitchers are ex­
tremely poor at holding runners on. If 
they can enter the late innings with a 
lead in their hands, they can feel confi­
dent in handing the game over to their 
impeccable bullpen —• a trait which the 
Phillies lack.
So, as one can see, these two teams 
match up fairly evenly in what should be 
another spectacular fall classic. My ad­
vice is to just sit back and enjoy every 
pitch for what it is worth, because after 
it’s over, the crack of the ball hitting the 
bat won’t be heard for another four 
months.
So has anybody wondered why such a 
big deal has been made by fans over the 
physical appearance of some key mem­
bers of the Phillies? Does it really make
any difference in the whole scheme of 
things ? They still won 97 regular season 
games and are one of the two out of 28 
major league teams still playing ball.
Why is everybody saying that Jack 
McDowell of the Chicago White Sox is 
the easy pick for the 1993 Cy Young 
award? People should stop and compare 
the numbers of the competition, namely 
fireballer Randy Johnson of the Seattle 
Mariners. Johnson’s earned run aver­
age is .11 points lower, he has 150 more 
strikeouts, 76 fewer hits inbasically the 
same number of innings, and the same 
number of complete games. The only 
major categories where McDowell beats 
Johnson is in wins, 3 more, and in shut­
outs, 1 more. One has to remember that 
the Cy Young award is intended for the 
best pitcher of the year, not the most 
valuable. After all, it is named after a 
man who won 511 games, yet had a 2-1 
record in the post seaon.
What ever happened to announcers 
helping to portray the excitment of the
game over to the viewer?
Granted CBS’ Sean McDonough and 
Tim McCarver definitely know their 
strategy, but McDonough’s call of Len 
Dykstra’s game winning home run in 
the 10th inning of game five of the Na­
tional League Playoffs did absolutely no 
justice to the importance and excite­
ment of the home run.
Imagine, baseball fans, if announcing 
great Vin Scully had the same oportunity 
to make a call on that home run. The call 
would have been elegant and glorious.
When will baseball stop bending over 
its back to please television executives? 
Is anything left sacred anymore, when 
society sees baseball move its premier 
showcase, the World Series, in order to 
make sure that David Letterman gets 
his say?
Well, until next time, enjoy the 
ballgame, and GO PHILLIES !!!!!!!

By Ian Tomas & Shankara Sarvendram
As we dawn on the NBA preseason, it is only 
appropriate that we offer our picks for the upcom­
ing season.
We shall begin with the three-time world cham­
pion Chicago Bulls. With the loss of the Sultan of 
Slam, Michael Jordan, it seems unlikely that this 
impressive streak will continue.
Will Scottie Pippen be able to step out of the 
shadow of Jordan and finally achieve 
superstardom? For the Bulls to even contend, it 
will be necessary for Horace Grant and European 
newcomer Toni Kukoc to have career seasons. Will 
B.J. Armstrong repeat his strong performance?
Eliminating the Bulls from the playoff picture, 
we feel the contending teams in their respective 
divisions are the New York Knicks out of the

the Houston Rockets out of the Midwest, and the

Look for fierce battles in the Atlantic and Pacific 
divisions. The up-

the addition of 
rookie point guard 
“Penny” Hardaway 
and a seasoned 
Shaquille O’Neal at 
center, will give the 
playoff proven 
Knicks a run for 
their money.
The Pacific division will be a free-for-all.
The Seattle Supersonics with the newly acquired 
Kendall Gill, budding superstar Shawn Kem,p and 
wily veteran Rickey Pierce will attempt to repeat 
their impressive playoff run of a year ago. The 
Phoenix Suns, who seem to be everyone’s favorite, 
will be severely hampered by the loss of Richard 
Dumas, who is indefinitely suspended due to his 
reoccurring drug problem. They will still be a 
major factor to deal with in the postseason.
Look for the running and gunning Golden State
Warriors with newly signed number one draft pick 
Chris Webber, premier point guardTim Hardaway, 
sharpshooting Chris Mullin, emerging star Latrell 
Sprewell, the steal of the 1992 draft pick, and Billy

franchise, which was thrown for a loop when Gill 
demanded his trade to Seattle.
In the Midwest, the Rockets are the pick of the 
litter so to speak, coming from yet another weak 
division. Franchise player Hakeem Olajuwon will 
lead his supporting cast to the division title.
In summation, the other side of the spectrum will 
hold once archrivals Boston Celtics and L.A. Lak­
ers fighting for not another championship banner 
but the rights to the number one draft pick in the 
lottery.
With the retirement of His Airness, Jordan, the 
fight for the championship will prove to be a toss 
up. .

Can’t afford to save for retirement?
The truth is, you can’t afford not to. 
i Not when you realize that your retirement 
can last 20 to 30,years or more. You'll want 
to live at least as comfortably then as you 
do now. And that takes planning.
By starting to save now, you can take 
advantage of tax-deferral and give your 
money time to compound and grow. 
Consider this: set aside just $100 each 
month beginning at age 30 and you can 
accumulate over $154,031* by the time 
you reach age 65. But wait ten years and 
you'll have to budget $211 each month 
to reach the same goal.
Even if you're not counting the years to 
retirement, you can count on TIAA-CREF 
to help you build the future you deserve— 
with flexible retirement and tax-deferred 
annuity plans, a diverse portfolio of invest­
ment choices, and a record of personal 
service that spans 75 years.
Over a million people in education ánd 
research put TIAA-CREF at thé top of 
their list for retirement planning. Why not 
join them?

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s tennis team finished 
up its season with matches 
against a pair of cross-town ri­
vals, the University of Pitts­
burgh and Chatham College. 
The team fell to Pitt, 8-1, then 
defeated Chatham, 8-0, to fin­
ish the season 4-8.
The team competed in the 
Catholic University of 
America’s Seventh Annual 
Women’s Pall Tennis Classic

played the number one singles 
at the eight-team tournament, 
and advanced to the semifinal 
round before losing. Senior co­
captain SharynRotunno played 
the number two singles. 
Rotunno lost in the first round, 
but advanced to the consola-

from the tournament. The third 
singles player, junior Cherie Lin, 
lost in the consolation bracket, as

Majikes.
In doubles, Rotunno and 
Kukura advanced to the semifi­
nals of the number one doubles 
tournament before losing, while 
Lin and freshman May Lee lost 
in the consolation bracket in the 
second doubles tournament. The 
third doubles team of Huang and 
Amin advanced to the semifinals 
as well, where they were defeated.
When the team took on 
Chatham on October 6, they 
swept every match. Rotunno was

Carnegie Mellon’s men’s cross­
country team picked up a big win 
over Grove City College on Sat­
urday, 18-41. The Tartans swept 
the top four places, with senior 
Jim Langer winning the meet in 
27:45.
Sophomore Matt Beam was 
second, a second behind Langer, 
and Sophomore Scott Moore was 
third, another second behind 
Beam. FreshmanJoshGreynolds 
took fourth place, another second 
behind. Freshman Paul Hatala 
placed eighth overall in 28:15.
Men’s coach Gary Meckley was 
pleased with his team’s perfor­
mance. He said the win made 
them 4-0 in dual meets, adding 
that the team had won about 118 
of its last 119 dual meets.
“When you’re not really chal­
lenged that much by another 
team, you don’t know where your 
team’s at,” Meckley said of the 
easy win. “We’ve got some good 
competitors, and they’ll give a 
good accounting, but I don’t know 
where we’ll be” at the UAA Cham­
pionships. “Let me say this about 
the people I have versus the
people Grove City had: In high 
school, their people were at least 
as talented, maybe more talented, 
than ours. That shows my team’s 
character. By right, this should 
have, been a very close meet.”
“I think there’s been aboutthree 
or four guys running well all 
year,” Meckley said. “I thought 
Scott Moore made a big jump in 
his improvement, probably the 
biggest improvement of anybody 
on the team. I will be looking for 
a fifth man, which is very impor­
tant in cross-country, and I don’t 
know who that’s going to be. It 
could be anyone of three or four 
guys.”
The women’s team lost to Grove 
City by a 22-37 score. Sopho­
more Missy Baustert won the 
meet, with a time of 19:19. Fresh­
man Becky Buchheit finished 
fifth in 20:20, and senior Cynthia 
Kolanowski finished ninth in 
20:55, her best time this season. 
Two other runners, Freshman 
Sharon Lay and sophomore 
Sangita Jinwala, also posted their 
best time of the year, with Lay 
finishing 10th in 21:03, and 
Jinwala finishing 12th in 21:14.
“This was our last little primer
before the UAA conference 
Championships,” women’s coaclj 
Dario Donatelli said. “We raii 
prettw well, and the way I figure 
that out isllookatour fourth and 
fifth runners and see how close! 
they are getting to our top two 
runners. Grove City is a toughj 
team this year, and I knew we’c^ 
have a tough row to hoe going in."
This was only the Tartans’ thirdj 
dual meet of the season, after yg 
double-dual meet to open the year,; 
and their first loss.
“I thought Missy ran a very] 
good race against their very good; 
front runner, on their home! 
course,” Donatelli said. “She ran: 
poorly the week before, so it’s, 
goodtoseeher running well again' 
right before UAAs.”
The two cross-country teams! 
are traveling to Emory Univer-i 
sity in Atlanta next week for the 
UAA Championships, then the 
men are going to Wheeling Jesuit 
College for an invitational the 
folio wing week, while the women 
are running in an exhibition 
against Duquesne University, 
and then both teams are going to 
the NCAA Mideastem Regional 
meet in November.
Rugby draws blood, 
defeats Pitt-Johnstown
By JUSTIN LAM
Womeon ’sngrm ueopptmgeam
The CMU Rugby team decisively defeated the University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown on Saturday 
by the score of 18-3. This was CMU’s first victory over UPJ in two years.
CMU began the game by driving hard and successfully taking advantage of UPJ’s mistakes. In 
the first five minutes of play, freshman Larry Adams was able to capitalize with a penalty kick, 
making the score 3-0. For another five minutes, CMU was able to maintain the attack that resulted 
in a try by freshman Chris Winston. Adams made the successful conversion kick, and the score 
became 10-0. ,
For the duration of the 40-minute half, neither team was able to score, but CMU showed 
dominance by keeping the ball in UPJ’s territory the majority of the time.
Within five minutes after halftime, Adams scored on another penalty kick, making the score 13-
0. Only a few minutes later, UPJ was finally able to score with a drop goal, making the score 13-
3. Close to the end of the half, senior Shugie Proctor was in the right place at the right time, taking 
advantage of a poor returning kick by UPJ’s fullback. Proctor was untouched as he scored the 
decisive try, making the score 18-3.
This match against UPJ seemed like CMU’s best performance of the year. CMU played relatively 
mistake-free ball and successfully took advantage of UPJ’s errors. CMU showed nice improvement 
in its play structure and performed as a much better team.
This victory raised the CMU ruggers to 3—2 on the season.

Houston Oilers, Warren Moon big mysteries
Quarterback Sneak
by John Weber
The Oilers’ biggest problem is them­
selves. They will never be a Super Bowl 
caliber team as long as they create their 
own problems. Coach Jack Pardee is one 
of the smartest coaches in the NFL. He 
brought the “run and shoot” to Houston, 
making the Oilers one of the first teams 
to use it. Second is Buddy Ryan. Ryan 
made a name for himself in the 1980s as 
a defensive coordinator and as coach of 
the Eagles. Then comes Warren Moon. 
Moon has broken NFL records for pass- 
ingandis annually oneofthe best passers 
in the AFC. The Oilers’ receivers have 
always been a group of quick, gutsy, 
talented players who brave the middle 
and hardly ever drop a pass. At fullback 
the Oilers have fifth-year pro Lorenzo 
White who consistently runs for about 
1000 yards annually and who always 
seems to get the first down when it is 
needed. On the other side of the ball the 
Oilers retain a big defensive line and a 
better than average backfield that con­
sistently slows the conservative offenses
of the Steelers and Browns, the top two 
teams in the AFC Central, the Oilers’ 
division. So why do the Oilers continu­
ally fall short of their ultimate goal — a 
chance to play in a Super Bowl? Simply, 
for all the Oilers talent, they do not have 
any of the traits of a Super Bowl team.
First, and most important, the Oilers 
are not playing as a team. Like the 
Eagles a few years ago, the attitude is: 
“You do your job and I’ll do mine!” They 
don’t seem to have confidence in each 
other. The Eagles play much better to­
day with less talent because they know 
they have to play hard together to win, 
unlike the Oilers who expect that they 
will win every game they play because of 
their individual talent. Second, the Oil­
ers are not a “classy” team, but a team of 
egotists, rogues, and thugs. This is left 
over from the Jerry Glanville days, when 
the hot-headed coach brawled with op­
ponents and preached winning at all 
costs. Moon and White are probably the 
only players on the team that don’t have 
their own end zone dance. When I think 
of the Steelers of the '70s and the 49ers 
of the ‘80s I can think of no “end zone 
dances.” These two problems lead to 
more problems.
Because they think they are “talented,” 
they tend to get down on themselves 
when they start losing. Also, I suspect 
there is also finger-pointing going in 
Houston these days too. Other general
“on-the-field” problems hurt the Oilers 
too. Houston often fails to be opportunis­
tic. An Oiler opponent will often be let off 
the hook and alio wed to attempt a come­
back despite several turnovers early in 
the game.
The Oilers have trouble holding a lead 
with their run and shoot offense. It is 
designed to score, score, and score more, 
not to sit on a 10 or 14 point lead. Pardee, 
however, is often reluctant to open up 
the game when he has a lead because of 
the possibility of interceptions. Add up 
all these problems and I get a 1-4 record.
Week 6 was another 4-1 week improv­
ing my record to 18-12 (.600). Looking 
back, I think I was sniffing something 
when I picked the Pack over Elway and 
gang, but everything turned out O.K. 
Reggie White must have heard me, his 
two sacks late in the game stymied the 
Bronco comeback as the Packers finally 
won their second game 30-27. The Oil­
ers get the “Bosworth Award” again as 
they turned the ball over to the Bills for 
almost every point they scored.
The Bills punched it in the first four 
times and then decided they were ready 
for their week off as they ran over the 
Oilers 35—7. The Raiders continue to 
confuse me. Just when you think they 
are done for, they dig up (almost liter­
ally) this Vince Evans guy and upset the 
Jets 24-20. Where did this Evans come 
from? I think he’s going to make a run for
Blanda’s “Years in the NFL” record. The 
Steel Curtain is back?
Well just about. Greg Lloyd has devel­
oped into one of the best linebackers in 
the NFL. The defense is playing a lot 
smarter this year and is forcing turn­
overs like never before.
As for the game, the Steelers won 16-
3 and John Frieszwonthe “dazed player” 
of the week award for San Diego. The 
“Team of the Week,” however, has to be 
the N.Y. Giants. They have already won 
more games than I thought they would 
all year.
With a 41-7 victory over the Redskins, 
they are once again in first place in the 
NFC East. I’m not sure they can beat the 
Cowboys, but they certainly are headed 
in the right direction.
The Cowboys are back and badder 
than ever. That Cowboy defense seems 
to be back to its ’92 form. With a 27-3 
victory over the Colts, they are once 
again the team to beat in the NFC.
Thank you Bears for provingmy point: 
Bubby Blister can’t handle arush. (Take 
notes Jets) Bears 17, Eagles 6. Without 
Dan Marino the Dolphins came back to 
beat the Browns 24-14.
The Browns need to find a starting 
quarterback and stick with him. The 
Patriots upset the Cardinals 23—21.
The Minnesota Vikings beat the 
Tampa Bay Bucs 15-0, and the Kansas 
City Chiefs beat the Bengals 17-15.
Top Five Picks for Week 8
1. Pittsburgh at Cleveland
For several weeks the Browns have. ' 
had everything they’ve wanted. Now it; 
is time for the Steelers to take back what; 
is rightfully theirs. The AFC Central 
Division: Steelers 23—10.
'
2. Buffalo at N.Y. Jets
This is a toss up. I’m leaning towards... 
the Jets. But the Bills defense looks' 
good. I’m still going to take the Jets in an 
upset: 35—27.
3. Minnesota at Chicago
I’m abandoning the Vikings’ shipl*-

University Rowing Club Brings home the Gold, Silver, Bronze
By CAROLYN SKARADA
Womeon ’sngrm ueopptmgeam
The University Rowing Club successfully started 
off their season at the Head of the Ohio race on 
October 2. Racing with their best times ever for 
this particular race, over half of CMU’s crews won 
medals in gold, silver and bronze. Beginning at the 
point, located downtown Pittsburgh where the 
Ohio meets the Monongahela River, the race con­
sisted of nearly four hundred crews with over a 
thousand competitors. As a result of poor water 
and weather conditions, the course was very diffi­
cult. However, times got faster as the land water 
(heavy with rain) increased the speed of the cur­
rent.
Both the A and B Men’s Club 8 boats were 
entered in the first race. Ohio State finished in the 
lead with a time of 13.34.7, CMU A finished second 
at 13.42.1, University of Pitt came in third place, 
and CMU B placed ninth at 15.11.9. During the 
race, Ohio State had a slight lead over Carnegie 
Mellon A, creating an exciting finish. Junior Dan 
Highlands, coxswain for the boat, steered past 
Duquesne during the crew’s excellent sprint down 
to the finish line. CMU B also had a solid race, 
while getting used to a new shell which had been 
acquired at 4:00 am that morning and rigged for 
the first time at 7:00 am immediately preceding 
the race. The CMU A crew consisted of Highlands 
as the coxswain, then junior John Pasewicz, junior 
Soren Roth, junior John Cosnek, staff member 
Arthur McNair, doctoral student Chris McConnell, 
sophomore Rick Gordon, alum Randy Simmons, 
and alum Chris Fetter. For CMU B, alum Aileen 
Doherty coxed her crew of junior Chris Maples,
alum Bill Posega, faculty member Ed Miller, fresh­
man David Taylor, sophomore James Bickley, fresh­
man Ben Fry, senior Stefan Groetsch, and sopho­
more Jeff Coyne. CMU A will compete at the Head 
of the Charles in Boston this weekend. The Charles 
is the largest one day race in the world drawing 
250,000 spectators. Other crews entered are the 
University of Michigan A, Notre Dame, Duquesne, 
Grand Valley, and Michigan.
In the Women’s Club 8 race, CMU won the gold, 
finishing with an excellent time of 15.16.5. Follow­
ing in second place was Duquesne at 15.59.8 and 
then Ohio State at 16.17.0. CMU crossed the finish 
line with an enormous 43 second lead ahead of 
Duquesne. Coxing for the Women’s Clul? 8 was 
sophomore Jenny Hwang. The rest of the crew 
consisted of alum Jan Loney, alum Susan Englert, 
doctoral student Anna Loney, staff member Julia 
Evans, graduate student Karla Isenberg, sopho­
more Cassa Hadley, staff member Chris Barensfeld, 
and senior Stephanie King. This race was a perfect 
season opener for the Women’s Club 8 and a good 
warm up for the Head of the Charles in Boston on 
Sunday October 24. Other crews entered for that 
race are Three Rivers Rowing, University of Michi­
gan A and B, Case Western Reserve, and Carlow 
College.
The Women’s Lightweight 4 competed excep­
tionally well in a race consisting often boat entries. 
Winning the bronze, with a time ofl 6.51.0, Carnegie 
Mellon came ahead of Notre Dame, University of 
Pitt, Ohio State and four others. Miami University 
of Ohio andTRRA led the close finish with times of 
15.51.3 and 15.59.0 respectively. The crew, con­
sisting of senior Vicki Roberts, alum Lisa Johnson, 
junior Amy Lefkowitz, and senior Jessica Schmidt,
was coxed by Highlands.
The Men’s lightweight 8 had a strong, competent 
race finishing in fourth place with a time of 14.30.5. 
First place for this race was Cornell at 13.19.8, 
followed by Pitt and then Notre Dame. Men’s 
lightweight 8 was also coxed by Hwang and the 
rowers included doctoral candidate Kevin Luczkow, 
sophomore Howard Meisner, junior Chris Liu, jun­
ior Matt Jezyk, staff member Ray Obenza, fresh­
man Tobey Bliksem, Chris Maples and staff mem­
ber Mike Bridges. Four lightweight men will be 
selected this week to compete in the Head of the 
Charles. Selection is based on rowing style, fitness 
(measured by the rowing ergometers) and seat 
racing, where the contribution of individual rowers 
is gauged by racing off two boats against each other 
and switching rowers from one boat to another. 
Other crews entered are Ohio State and Canisius 
College.
For the Open Division, the Women’s Open 8 
finished in ninth place with a time of 15.23.2. The 
top three leaders: Cornell, Brown, and MIT, along 
with the other entries (some of which ranked in the 
top five nationally) provided intense competition. 
CMU’s crew included alum Beth Ward, Evans, 
Isenberg, junior Jeni Wightman, junior Kirsten 
Buttler, senior Jerri Sanders, alum Katie Greeno 
and junior Karen Knepper. Doherty was the cox­
swain.
In the Women’s Open Double Sculls, CMU (con­
sisting of alum Opal Perry and Englert) came in 
third place with a time of 20.14.3. Considering the 
bad water conditions, this was a vigorous first race 
for this combination of rowers. The shell took on a 
substantial amount of water, making it extremely 
heavy and difficult to row down the course. In the
men’s section of the race, a double from Canada- 
completely filled with water and was paddled across ' 
the line by its crew.
During the Women’s Club 4 event, CMU made a 
good showing down the course in the middle of the 
pack, however, they did not place in the top five. 
The crew led by senior coxswain S. Antigone King, 
included Hadley, Greeno, graduate student Decky 
Gander, and Johnson.
Perry, representing CMU in the Women’s Open 
Singles, contributed a third place finish in her 
second race of the day. As a result of the rough 
water conditions, the single sculls faced the test of 
power ability on the blade rather than sculling 
finesse. Perry competed well in a strong field.
For the mixed doubles competition, King and“ 
Brad Klosinski finished second with an excep­
tional sculling performance in theij- first race to­
gether. Three Rivers Rowing Association member 
Oscar Mayer, rowing in the recreational single 
race, came in second place. His summer training 
and »determination proved useful. The Women’s 
Open Quad placed first against Allegheny River 
with a time of 18.48.6. This was a remarkable 
result, considering the crew was put together the 
day of the race (to help out TRRA) and contained 
two rowers who had never been in a quad before. A 
quad seats four scullers, each with two blades, and 
has no coxswain.
The University Rowing club is now looking for­
ward to their upcoming races with high expecta­
tions. These races include the Head of the Charles 
in Boston this past weekend and the Head of the 
Occoquan near DC.
The Occoquan will be the first race for this fall’s 
novice squads.

Campus unites, learns
Awareness Week addresses big issue
By TONYA RADO
Womeon Oyygyeone jaoesmay PLgerm
Alcohol is the most widely used drug 
on American college and university cam­
puses. While alcohol can promote cama­
raderie and conviviality for some, each 
year some serious injuries and deaths 
result from its misuse. Unfortunately, 
Carnegie Mellon is no exception. Stu­
dents have suffered from head injuries, 
automobile accidents, fights, sexual as­
saults, vandalism, academic failure, and 
even near-deaths.
Although most of us know a great 
deal about alcohol, we do not always 
incorporate this knowlegde in our daily 
activities. Periodically, this results in 
poor decision-making, which can be 
devestating to us and those around us.
In academics and extracurricular 
activities, CMU is committed to sup­
porting each student to develop his or 
her full potential as an individual and 
recognizes the potential obstacles that 
alcohol poses toward achieving this end. 
Thus, CMU devotes great attention 
and resources to alcohol-related con­
cerns.
Alcohol Awareness Week (October 
18-22) is reserved to allow us the op­
portunity to reflect back on our daily 
lives and learn how to make positive 
decisions in the future. “[At Carnegie 
Mellon],... the alcohol education envi­
ronment is geared toward concentrat­
ing less on button-wearing and more 
on stopping to see what we can do,” 
says Kevin Hughes, assistant to the 
dean of Student Affairs.
The University offers a comprehen­
sive approach to the prevention and 
the treatment of alcohol misuse through 
on-campus counseling and referral in­
formation, medical services, educa­
tional programming, films, and bro­
chures, information on how to handle 
alcohol-related emergencies, and so­
cial host responsibility guidelines.
Throughout the week there will be 
different programs geared toward Al­
cohol Awamess. In residence halls, for 
instance, zUaon onL urfam starring 
Michael Keaton will be showing.
“We’re trying to steer away from tell­
ing students to not drink this weekend
or to stop smoking, an approach that 
many college and universities focus on,” 
says Hughes. “Instead, we want to focus 
our attention on informing students that 
there are places and people to turn to for 
help. If you are concerned with your own 
alcohol use or misuse, or that of a friend 
or family member, the Counseling and 
Student Development Center at 
Morewood Gardens is available as a 
prime resource to students for consulta­
tion about, «identification of, and treat­
ment for substance abuse problems.” 
Assessment services are also avail­
able to help individuals evaluate their 
own use of alcohol. You can receive an 
objective, professional opinion by arrang­
ing an appointment with a counselor at 
the Counseling and Student Develop­
ment Center or with a health profes­
sional at the Student Health Center 
(268-2157).

International Festival covers Africa
By ZHUOHAN CAI
Womeon ’sngrm ueopptmgeam
The International Festival, four days of interesting pro­
grams aimed at increasing cultural awareness on campus 
through direct participation, begins this Wednesday. Opening 
with fanfare and ceremony in Skibo, a musical presentation 
will kick off the varied programs.
Three keynote speakers, each well known in their individual 
fields, will speak on topics pertinent to present-day Africa. 
Dumisani Kumalo, a journalist exiled from South Africa, will 
ik on apartheid and the continuing struggle for freedom in 
his country. Having worked intimately with many in the fore
of the fight, including __________________________________
Nelson Mandela and 
Desmond Tutu, Kumalo 
is considered one of the 
Oost knowledgeable 
speakers in the field of 
apartheid.
The second keynote 
speaker, Dr. Ali Mazrui 
from Kenya, is a well- 
known historian. Mazuri 
served on various com­
mittees and boards forthe 
3.N. and the Organiza- 
ion for African Unity and will speak on Africa and the Black 
World in the New World Order.
Camelia Sadat will speak on ‘The Role of Arab Women — 
Progress and Disadvantage.” Daughter of the late Egyptian 
President Anwar El Sadat, she has received kudos from Con­
fess and the President for her dedicated contributions to the 
peace movement.
Receptions following each talk will allow opportunity for 
Questions.
Another traditonal feature ofthis year’s festival, a Personal 
Journey, is a series of informal talks given by a member of the 
--MU community on a topic of their choice. This adds a 
Personal perspective to the Festival.
For music lovers, various African artists will perform in the 
evenings. Audiences will be treated to a repertoire of sounds 
m the traditional to the contemporary. Some performances

In addition, African arts and crafts will be exhibited in a 
bazaar on the Cut. Hands-on basket weaving in the style of 
western Botswana will also be taught. Another event, A 
Parade of Traditional Costumes’ is a vibrant display of 
vibrant African apparel. As the billing suggests, there is 
more to the event than a sampling of the costumes them-

The African oral tra­
dition willbe presented 
in folk tales told by Ni­
gerian story-teller 
Jumoke Ewedemi. Af- 
rican stories told 
through movement will be performed by junior actors from 
the Drama Department. The Kuntu Repertory Theater’s 
rendition of Ghanaian playwright Ama Ata Aidoo’s “Di­
lemma of a Ghost” explores the marriage problems of a West 
African man and an African-American woman.
Faces of a continent captured on film will be displayed in 
two exhibitions. One is a collection of photos from Malawi on 
display in Hunt Library. The other is where local Peace 
Corps volunteers display photos and share experiences from 
their African travels.
The African Student Organization and African embassies 
and tourist offices are sponsoring a Cultures and Informa­
tion Fair on the Cut.
The Festival is overseen by the International Awareness 
Committee. Set up by President Robert Mehrabian to pro­
mote multicultural enrichment on campus, the committee 
consists of administrators, faculty and students. Aliya Khan, ,9surs rss wIjThwt 0u­s kA

bers.
Parents’ Weekend provides an oppor­
tunity for family to meet members of the 
Carnegie Mellon family, including fac­
ulty and members of the administration 
and even other parents. It is a time to 
learn about the university, while offer­
ing many relaxing social activities for 
students and parents to spend time to­
gether.
On Friday, October 22, a continental 
breakfast will be served from 8-llam. 
Then at 11am, buses will depart from 
Skibo Hall for a tour of the city. The 
afternoon offers lectures from faculty 
members such as Lynn Holden, associ­
ate dean in CFA, who will present Pi8he 
onL e1a Nmgign rp zg”gUg^oegrn, That 
evening, parents and families have the 
choice of seeing a concert, a movie or 
7UrrL 'aLLgni, a drama performance

NCOD builds awareness
By KATHY WRIGHT
Womeon ueopptmgeam
National Coming Out Day (NCOD), 
is no longer reserved strictly for gays, 
lesbians, and bisexuals to come out of 
the closet. It is an opportunity for 
supporters to show belief in freedom 
of sexuality, a right that many people 
desire but may not always strive to 
establish—especially when that right 
concerns something so personal.
Since 1988, October 11 has been 
designated NCOD, commemorating 
the 1987 March on Washington for 
Lesbian
Rainbow ribbons and triangles supple­
ment the pink triangle; these symbols 
represent the allies of gays, lesbians, 
bisexuals and their rights.
“To be gay is to be part of a basically 
invisible minority. So events like 
NCOD, the March on Washington, 
and certainly campus events, are very 
important to give visibility to gays, 
lesbians, bisexuals, and allies. It is 
through this visibility that ideas are 
challenged, people are educated, 
friendships are made, and role mod­
els are found,” says Harriet Schwartz, 
assistant to the dean of Student Af-
fairs.“[NCOD] is a great day for rec- Katarina1 ’ < ’ Middle-ogmtion of a lifestyle that is in fort, a se

statement by lesbians and gays every­
where.
Due to mid-semester break, 
cmuOUT day supplemented NCOD 
lastTuesday on campus. The cmuOUT 
organization set up an information 
table outside Doherty Hall for the 
day. Student members of cmuOUT 
and ALLIES distributed pink triangles 
to members of the lesbian, gay, and 
bisexual community, and rainbow rib­
bons to the supporters of gay rights 
and sexual freedom.
The pink triangle is a symbol from 
the Holocaust, us£d by the Nazi’s, to 
mark gays and lesbians. This power­
ful symbol is still used today to specifi­
cally recognize gays and lesbians.
for AL­
LIES, says, “[NCOD] is a great day for 
recognition of a lifestyle that is in the 
minority and treated that way. It is a 
day when all people should take a 
moment to realize the freedoms they 
have and the freedoms they don’t and 
ask ‘why?’ Sexual orientation is a 
freedom all people should have.”
“It’s a reminder to me of how far I’ve 
come and that there are many other 
people out there who have had the 
courage to come out and that there 
are many more who will follow me,” 
says Kim Mehan, freshman MCS stu­
dent, ofher personal experience. “[It’s] 
important to remember that you’re 
not alone.”

Dating scene isn’t universal
Alien in Residence
By Micki Kochanskyj
Last Thursday night, the hot­
test place to be on campus was 
undoubtedly Doherty Hall 2210. 
If you were one of 
the lucky ones who 
managed to get in 
to see lgBa 'oeam 
jrm z1r.rUoea, you 
will know what I 
mean when I say 
that this is a great 
date movie.
For those of you 
who were not so 
lucky, I will ex­
plain. The film 
oozed sensuous­
ness; it practically 
melted the screen 
with suggested 
erotica; it featured, 
in one memorable 
scene, a naked 
woman sitting 
astride a bandit on 
a galloping horse.
My date said the 
movie was worth 
the price of admission (still a steal 
at $1 with ID) for that shot alone. 
Most people I saw there, were, in 
fact, on a date. Which got me 
thinking—what exactly is a date?
Believe it or not, dating is not 
something all people do as a sort 
of rite of passage during their 
teenage years. In Britain, for ex­
ample, there isn’t even a word for 
dating as Americans know it. 
Actually, dating as a concept
doesn’t exist. It is seen as some­
thing uniquely American, as sort 
of a defining cultural character­
istic. It’s something you see 
American teens do in movies and 
wish you could do, too.
I tried to explain this to my 
Thursday night date, who was in 
a state of shock. (Though whether 
from the thought that dating 
doesn’t exist in my home country, 
or from the woman on the horse, 
I don’t know.)
In my high school at least, girls 
and boys tended to sit at opposite
Ramsey Hong/Tartan Art Editor
ends of the classroom. At break, 
the boys went out to play soccer, 
while the girls sat on desks look­
ing at magazines and listening to 
a discrete pocket radio. There 
were no places on school grounds 
to congregate such as lockers, 
recreation rooms, bleachers. No 
school paper, school play, candy 
store. No school buses, or extra­
band practice.
I asked my date what he used 
to do on a date in high school.
“Maybe she’d watch my team 
play, then I’d pick her up later for 
a drive and a movie. Maybe a 
McDonalds or something, you 
know.”
“Aha!” I said, “That explains it! 
There are no school sports teams 
to cheer on. With the driving age 
at eighteen, no-one has wheels. 
There are no Cineplexes or high­
way fast-food joints, either.” 
“Whoa,” he said. “That’s awful.
What on earth did 
you Lr% 
What we did was 
keep to ourselves. 
Stayed home, 
watched TV, did 
our homework. 
There was no way 
you would let a guy 
know you were in­
terested in him, 
and vice-versa. 
That would mean 
settingyourselfup 
for ridicule.
If dicovered, you 
would never have 
liveditdown. Ifyou 
did see someone 
outside school, it 
was kept a deathly 
secret.
“Very strange,” 
my date said, no 
doubt thinking me 
a creature from another planet. 
“But why?”
I put it down to the good old 
British reserve. One can never be 
too discrete. Perhaps it’s a larger 
cultural difference. Certainly this 
phenomenon is not restricted to 
the British Isles.
European teens in general tend 
not to spend as much time as
curricular activities to hang American teens in pursuit of the 
around for. No trips, clubs, no ,9surs rss LwNTGJt 0u­s kA

Askew, No Shoes
By Matt Messner
§1: Frustrated with life in 
general, and col­
lege in specific, 
you search for 
some mindless 
diversion. You 
pick up the latest 
edition of The 
Tartan and after 
wandering 
through, decide 
to read this col­
umn in a vain at­
tempt to avoid 
thinking about 
what you prob­
ably should stop 
thinking about 
and start doing.
Unfortunately, 
as you approach 
the end of the 
first paragraph it 
occurs to you that 
you are not just a 
spectator to the 
text before you. The column, 
being particularly mindless, 
minding less the particulars, is 
demanding your participation. 
If you:
1. Decide that you have ex­
pended to much energy already 
and put down the paper—go to 
§2.
2. Decide, although mildly ir­
ritated, to continue reading if 
only because you’d really rather 
not think about what you’d
rather not think about—go to§3.
3. W ant t o kno w ho w to ke ep an

The merits of being ill: My1 
body, being less happy than if 
is wont, requested that I get a 
professional opinion as to my// 
health.
My mind 
translated thif 
(incorrectly?) as 
meaning that I 
should go ttr 
Health Ser-" 
vices. They con-' 
firmed, after' 
much delibera-"; 
tion, that I was!&1 
in fact, sick. In' 
technical terms,- 
I suffer fronf 
“probably some" 
sort of virusf' 
that “will prob-‘ 
ably go; awayll 
and should 
“keep doing 
what I’m doingV 
along with “feel 
better.”
Thus assured 
of the state I am 
Tartan Art Editor in, I decided to 
make the most of it by seeing 
what benefits it had over good 
health. When you’re ill, you can 
prank call your friends and 
they won’t know it’s you.
No one will want to share 
your food. If you want a head 
rush all you have to do is stand 
up. Generating enough air-ve- 
locity through sneezing to blow 
out birthday candles isn’t a 
problem.

Peace Corps offers world knowledge, career benefits

After earning your degree from 
¡arnegie Mellon, you have sev- 
ral options — get a job, go to 
raduate school, or get some work 
¡¡perience before focusing on a 
pecific career. The Peace Corps 
f the United States is an excel- 
¦nt way for students with under­
graduate degrees to accomplish 
ill three of these things, and gain 
Slot more in the process.
“The Peace Corps is a great 
pportunity for anyone who has 
he educational background or 
rork experience to qualify,” says 
yank Higdon, Peace Corps re- 
ruiter at the University of Pitts- 
urgh. Higdon says the Peace 
lorps needs workers inmany skill 
reas— areas in which Carnegie 
[ellon students have solid back- 
rounds, such as education, civil 
ngineering, computer science, 
aemistry, physics, biology, math, 
nvironmental studies, health, 
tnguage, and business.
“A lot of students get their de- 
rees and then wander around
for awhile looking for entry-level 
positions at businesses or in re­
tail. But if you go into the Peace 
Corps after college, you have the 
opportunity to work with pro­
fessionals as a professional — 
by learning and teaching skills 
in an area of your interest,” says 
Higdon.
Volunteering experience and 
specialized training in specific 
areas, whatPeace Corps recruit­
ers call demonstrated skills, also 
increase a student’s chances of 
getting into the program. Work­
ing with such organizations as 
Pittsburgh Literacy Initiative to 
gain tutoring experience, volun­
teering with Habitat for Human­
ity to enhance construction and 
building skills, or having clini­
cal skills such as working in a 
hospital, for the Red Cross, or on 
an emergency rescue team, is 
also helpful.
Students may be reluctant to 
volunteer for two years for fi­
nancial reasons, but Higdon says 
these worries are unfounded. 
School loans may be deferred for 
the entire length of your service
and up to six months after your 
return. You are given full 
medical and dental 
coverage, 
monthl 
salary 
for ex- 
pen-
to not have money—they tend to 
over compensate,” says 
Higdon.
Prepar­
ing for

ate

ded), other

and $5,500 to rees- Courtesy of the Peace Corps vantage to Peace

Corps doesn’t want its volunteers at several graduate schools across
the country as a means for stu­
dents to get their master’s degree 
while also serving in the Peace 
Corps. “My Peace Corps work ex­
perience actually got me into 
graduate school,” says Higdon.
The Peace Corps has three main 
goals for its volunteers to keep in 
mind. First, to introduce Ameri­
cans to other cultures and ways 
of life. Second, for people of other 
countries to come in contact with 
Americans. And third, for volun­
teers, once they return, to edu­
cate friends about their experi­
ences. This way, Peace Corps al­
lows people to build personal re­
lationships with people from for­
eign cultures and promotes glo­
bal understanding and respect 
for others welfare and survival as 
people.
Although the Peace Corps is 
lookingfor volunteers, a competi­
tive application process enforces 
the admittance of only the best 
trained and most serious work­
ers. According to Higdon, of the 
250,000 people who inquire about 
the Peace Corps, only 3,000 actu­
ally are employed. Applicants
must submit an application six to 
nine months before their service 
begins.
Then, if accepted, they attend 
staging, a three to four day inter­
active conference with all of those 
who have been accepted to dis­
cuss what they will need to bring, 
what to expect, and possible mis­
conceptions.
The volunteers are then flown 
to their respective countries of 
work and go through three 
months of intensive training. This 
usually consists of eight to 10 
hours of language and technical 
training, plus four to six hours of 
appropriate teaching methods for 
the area a day.
“The training session really 
shows you what you’re getting 
into. A lot of people go home dur­
ing this time. It’s a pretty intense 
situation,” says Higdon.
The Peace Corps remains an 
option which suits student needs. 
Whether it be used as a supple­
ment to graduate school, or work 
study, it has not only career ben­
efits, but long-lasting and per­
sonal ones as well.

Coming out day helps minority
Lw]t MyCl 0u­s kT
ALLIES is a group on campus which consistantly 
supports the rights and freedoms of gays, lesbians, 
and bisexuals so that these minorities do not have 
to feel isolated and alone. “ALLIES is here to think 
about these issues and be sensitive to them. We 
work with all people to develop understanding,” 
Midelfort says.
Schwartz agrees. “I think ALLIES is a phenom­
enal group. Here we have a group of students 
committed to supporting gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
members of the campus community, and, in addi­
tion to that, supporting respect and fair treatment 
to all members of the community. The phenomenal 
thing about it is that some members of the group 
are gay, lesbian, and bisexual, but many members 
are straight, and so they’re investing their time 
and energy to help other people in a way that is just
different than when you are working on an issue 
that directly impacts you. These students under­
stand a most important concept, and that is as long 
as anyone is being harassed, assaulted, or denied 
basic rights, no one is safe and free.”
Midelfort also says, “ALLIES supports NCOD 
because it is recognition of a repressed group 
seeking freedoms that we believe in.” NCOD is a 
reminder for everyone to join together everyday to 
acknowledge and accept a basic freedom: the free­
dom of choice in all areas and aspects of every 
individual’s life. National Coming Out Day is a 
celebration of these basic rights.

Sickness gives reason for whining
”Thqt MyCl 0u­s 12
No one can tell whether you’re 
coughing to get someone’s atten­
tion or to please your lungs. Ig­
noring the world is much easier 
when your body is incessantly 
complaining. Being sick builds 
character. You are supporting the 
economy and major corporations 
like Kleenex. You have a legiti­
mate right to whine. Profession­
als want you to take drugs. You’re 
giving some poor orphan microbe 
a home.
Mandatory telephone-related 
paragraph: Due to budget cuts 
this column can only afford to 
have one sentence in this para­
graph. Reader update: Attention, 
attention... this column can now
boast having “a few” readers. We 
have passed the “one” and “a 
couple” marks and now have three 
verified readers. Perhaps next 
week we’ll pass “a few (3-4)” and 
move on to “some (5-6).” Who 
knows, if human nature holds 
true we may even reach “several 
(7+).” What human nature? 
Simple. I’m sure you’ve overheard 
this before: “This tastes awful, 
try it.” Well, why not: “This is 
awful, read it.” All we can do 
(That’s the royal we. If the paper 
were in color it would be blue.) is 
hope... ^nd threaten.

scanner broke) Killer Bunny this week will 
contain no computer shading, nifty com­
puter effects, or straight lines. I also had to 
physically cut and glue the words onto this

irvana, Pearl Jam releases succeed

! 1992 was a big year for Nirvana 
id Pearl Jam. Both went multi-multi 
^tinum, and together they changed 
_ie entire tone of American pop. Per- 
[formers like Mariah Carey, Aero- 
xith, and Shai still move lots of 
its, but the success of bands like 
ie'arl Jam and Nirvana showed that 
isteners wanted more.
This fall, they’re getting it. The

’eamr has already reached number 
ie on the Billboard album charts, 
id next week it will probably be 
j?earl Jam’s turn to knock Garth 
jrooks from the top with %y, (pro-
nounced “versus”).
Many non-musical comparisons can 
be drawn between the two albums. 
Interestingly, both came out on vinyl 
record format first, and the struc­
tures of both seem unusually suited to 
the medium. One wonders if this sup­
port of the vinyl format, considered 
mostly extinct by the mainstream 
since the advent of CDs, can be read 
as a back-door criticism of the major- 
label system in which both Pearl Jam 
and Nirvana are undeniably major 
players.
Both albums also end with tracks in 
which the bands’ frontmen describe 
in ironic terms their struggles with 
huge, instant stardom. In “All Apolo­
gies,” Nirvana singer/guitarist Kurt 
Cobain sings, “What else should I be?/
All apologies ... I wish I was like you/ much difference does it make?” In

Lughnasa opens at 
Pittsburgh Public
courtesy Right Side Management and AB Concerts
Ladysmith Black Mambazo, an internationally acclaimed South African 
musical group, will be performing on campus this Thursday at 8 pm in the 
Skibo Ballroom. The band was made most famous in America when they 
backed Paul Simon during his 1987 Graceland tour but are well-known 
around the world for their other accomplishments. Their 1988 recording 
Shaka Zulu won a Grammy for Best Traditional IVIusic Recording, and 
played the part of the omnipotent chorus in the 1993 Broadway 
production of The Song of Jacob Zulu.
Ladysmith Black Mambazo has also done extensive soundtrack work, 
appearing in the credits of Coming to America, Dry White Season, and 
Michael Jackson’s Moonwalker. They’ve also performed on Sesame 
Street and in an award-winning 7-UP commercial.
Coming from the small black township of Claremont, near the larger 
Pinetown, the band brings a first-hand sincerity and truthfulness about 
the black South African experience.
The show is being co-sponsored by AB Concerts in conjuction with the 
International Festival on Africa.

Never having been to The Public 
before, I was impressed with the 
beauty of the theater, which show­
cases a traditional theater-in-the- 
round stage set-up as well as a flair 
for modem decor. The design of the 
stage allows for high visibility for the 
entire audience whether you are sit­
ting in the front, on the side, or on the 
balcony wings of the theater. For 
-on.gni Oe lsi1noyow a mural of the 
Irish countryside decorated the sole 
backdrop of the stage and the floor. 
Simple stage props furnished a mod­
est kitchen set with five tables, two 
cabinets, a few chairs, a radio, and 
some food. Actors entered from all 
four comers of the square stage and 
sat still as the main character, a man 
named Michael, began narrating the 
play.
Michael shares his impressions of 
what the Lughnasa Festival was like 
for him in the summer of 1936 when 
he was seven years old living with his 
single mother and four aunts in the 
small town of Ballybeg in County 
Donegal, Ireland. Despite their rela­
tion as sisters living in the same do­
mestic arrangement, each of these 
five women distinguish themselves 
immediately with diverse personali­
ties and outlooks on life. Michael is 
reunited with his uncle, Father Jack 
(the older brother of the five Mundy 
sisters), who returns to Ballybeg with 
malaria which he caught on duty as a 
missionary priest in Uganda. That 
summer he also meets his vagrant 
father, Gerry, for the first time. De­
spite Gerry’s irresponsibility as a fa­
ther, he sweeps away Michael’s 
mother, Chris, with his suave nature 
and makes promises to both Michael 
and Chris that he never keeps.
-on.gni Oe lsi1noyo is a serious 
play that lasts over two hours. I usu­
ally find plays to be much less enter­
taining than musicals, yet -on.gni 
Oe lsi1noyo did not seem incredibly 
long. In fact, I found it to be intriguing 
from beginning to end. The actors 
were so engulfed in their roles that 
they immediately drew me into the 
complexity of their characters. I 
watched the play attentively to find 
out more about each person and was 
amazed at how much concentration 
the actors displayed. At times, an au­
dience member was within an arms

•arth and SVy exhibit far from ‘primitive’
By SUSAN STUART
nomeon ’sngrm ueoptmgeam
African art, often crudely classified as “primi- 
ive,” implies a lack of complexity or sophistication. 
Pittsburgh artist Erwin Kalla’s “Between Earth 
ind Sky” exhibit, an intriguing collection of origi- 
lal drawings and collected African sculptures cur- 
.^ntly on display at Hewlett Gallery successfully 
¡futes this misconception. The exhibit opened at 
iewlett Gallery on October 6 and will continue 
pugh October 29. It will also be run in conjunc­
ión with the campus-wide International Festival 
Africa, October 21-23.
a’s collection of African 
is an appropriate comple- 
ient to his own original works.
African art, simplification, 
istraction, and exaggeration 
jfforms are devices that attempt 
»reak open the raw, emotional 
iression in a work. It is this 
¡nd that Kalla seems to be striv- 
‘g; toward in his own artwork, 
od uses similar means to 
[chieve it. The artist continues 
¡e tradition, begun about a cen- 
try ago, of deriving inspiration 
'om African art forms. A vast 
lumber of artists, including 
augin, Rousseau, Kirchner, 
echstein, Klee, and Picasso have 
|en intrigued by the “primitive” 
alities of tribal art, and have 
pressed and developed their in- 
•iration in various ways. Kalla’s 
'orks recall Picasso’s art espe- 
through the use of abstraé­
is and exaggeration of the fe- 
e form in a Cubist style. Al- 
IQugh there have been numer- 
mterpretations on this theme,
[la proves that original, beauti- 
works of this subject nature 
^ still be created.
:vaUa uses a combination of ap- 
oaches to primitivism (for lack 
! & better word) in his art which 
of various early modem 
'les have employed. For instance,
Uch of his art is predominantly
cubist in style complemented by elements of sur­
realism, particularly in his drawings. The percep­
tual depth in these works provides a complemen­
tary background for the modeled, sculpture-like 
elements in the foreground. Particularly stun­
ning are the cool, vibrant hues of ultramarine 
that convey a richness of depth in these back­
grounds, amazingly achieved only through the 
use colored pencil.
An image of modem popular culture in W1a P8ay 
rp 0oLrnno is one element that brings Kalla’s art 
up to the present. Humorously, the eyes of the 
Madonna in this work belong not to the 
holy virgin as traditionally depicted, but
to the not-so-virtuous modem pop singer.
Kalla deals with a wide range of emotional themes 
—everything from the whimsical, to the contempla­
tive, to the unsettling. Works that fall under the 
latter category include %g.egFyw a piece composed of 
a pine box filled with terra cotta masks. The empty, 
haunted gaze of faces frozen in time and piled 
together disturbingly suggests the termination of 
masses of humanity.
Varied in thematic content and style, Kalla’s 
works reflect upon nature through form and color in 
engaging expressions that are far from primitive.

New Rush CD returns band to its roots
By JASON ANCRACKI
Womeon ueopptmgeam
Although the new Rush album zrsneam9homey 
is only going on sale tomorrow, WDVE treated 
its listeners to a world premiere of it last 
Thursday at 10 pm. In addition to the new disc 
they also played prerecorded interviews with 
the band conducted by Steve Warden in Rush’s 
hometown of Toronto, Ontario. The interview 
excerpts helped introduce the songs, explain 
their meanings, and give some history.
Bassist Geddy Lee began the show by ex- 
plainingthe preliminaries of ma.rmLgni zrsneamS
homey, He said they wanted a more new and 
innovative sound to this release that still went 
back to the basics to their roots as a guitar- 
driven band. To do this they chose one of their 
old producers, Peter Collins, who had changed 
a lot since working with them before. .
Tthey also opened witha great song ^Be­
tween Sun and Moon,” which has a heavy, 
energetic sound, more reminiscent of material 
like 'rmBgni 0on than any of the newer songs.
After the first song we got to hear from 
drummer and lyricist Neil Peart (pronounced, 
by the way, ‘piert,’ not ‘pert’). In his comments, 
Peart concentrated on the creative aspects of 
the new album. He also described the new CD 
as a “selection of individual themes,” unlike 
the single theme on ¡rUU e1a 7rnay, Influences 
for this album were the writings of Carl Jung 
and the nature of heroes and role models. 
According to Peart, “Duality is the only unify­
ing theme, hence zrsneam9homey” He said the 
songs’ only real unifying factor was their being 
produced across the same period of time. Peart 
introduced the second song, “Nobody's Hero.” 
This folky song was a very personal one for 
Peart. It dealt with people who were heroes to 
him but unknown to the rest of the world. The 
first verse deals with the first gay that Peart 
knew in London. This friendship prevented 
him from being homophobic, but they drifted 
apart because of geography and “When I heard 
that he was gone, I felt a shadow cross my 
heart, but he’s nobody’s hero.” ,
Guitarist Alex Lifeson spoke mainly about 
the musical directions of zrsneam9homey, On 
this album Rush wanted to focus more on being 
a three-piece unit of bass, guitar, and drums. 
Lifeson said he had a much different approach 
to this album than Rush’s previous recordings. 
He entered the studio for the first time in 12 
years to direct the guitar tracks and didn’t 
want to be “encumbered by effects.” He wanted 
to change his sound without using other de­
vices aside from an amp because, “The shortest 
distance between guitar and amp is best.”
This more simplistic direction is evident on 
“Double Agent.” Lee says about this song, “We 
just wanted to get our ya-yas out.” This song 
features heavy guitar and bass sounds as well 
as a very melodic quality and spoken word 
parts by Lee.
“Animate” is about one person — a man 
dominating his sensitive side. But it seems like 
there are two people so it is also close to a love 
song. This highlights the great rhythm section 
of Lee and Peart that Rush has become famous 
for. The first single off zrsneam9homey, “Stick It 
Out,” begins with a Jimi Hendrix-like riff. 
“Everyday Glory” as you can tell from the title 
is a very uplifting song, yet it doesn’t go over­
board.
One of the most interesting songs off this new 
disc, and probably my favorite, is “Alien Shore.” 
Although this seem like a science fiction title, 
it deals with the contemporary themes of sex­
ism and racism. “Sex is not a competition, for 
you and me sex is not a job description.... Race 
is not a competition, for you and me race is not 
a definition, for you and me, we agree.”
What Rush release would be complete with­
out an instrumental track? For Rush an instru­
mental is like recess, a time to play around and 
show off.'On zrsneam9homey it is “Leave That 
Thing Alone,” which is awfully similar to 
“Where’s My Thing” from ¡rUU e1a 7rnay, They 
claim the only similarity is they both have 
thing in the title. “It’s just not the same thing,” 
joked Lifeson. “It’s a totally different thing.”
“The Speed of Love” reunites Peart with co­
writer Pie DuBois who co-wrote “Tom Sawyer” 
and “Force Ten.” The last two songs, according 
to Lee, were meant to ease the listener out of a 
very aggressive recording. “Cold Fire” is actu­
ally a love song, something very foreign to 
Rush. In order to avoid being trite about a 
male-female relationship, Peart focused on a 
more contemporary view of romance that in­
cludes “unconditional love” and “traditional 
roles” and the line “I’ll be around if you don’t let 
me down. ” Due to the almost steel guitar sound 
of this track a country version of this song was 
recorded but not released.

‘Reluctant’ successes for Pearl Jam, Nirvana
OTs“gOgk from page L13
agreeing neither to apologize for their 
power nor to accept the responsibility 
that comes along with being adored by 
millions of impressionable kids.
The new records share their greatest 
similarity, though, in that both bands 
use them to move unselfconsciously be­
yond the albums which brought them 
f fame and commercial success. Both work 
extremely well in that respect.
C Tn :eamr is a collection of pop-punk 
gems. The first single, “Heart-ShapedI
 Box,” combines sneering vocals and 
crushing instrumentation with straight- 
out-of-Hall-and-Oates hooks (the last 
line of the chorus is a note-for-note rep­
lica of the last line of the chorus in “Out 
of Touch”). “Rape Me” sounds a lot like 
“Smells Like Teen Spirit,” but the bridge 
saves it from being formulaic. In “Frances 
Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Se­
attle,” Dave Grohl’s drumming, alter­
nately pop-happy and tribal pound, is a 
standout, and when Cobain sings, “It’s 
so relieving to know that you’re leaving 
as soon as you get paid.... I miss the 
comfort in being sad,” it seems like a 
smart-ass requiem for pre-“grunge” Se­
attle, before the days of Marc Jacobs’s 
$1500 ripped sweaters and stories in 
datytaaB and :uO WrLo8,
The album reaches its peak with the 
soaring brutality of “Milk It,” while “All 
Apologies” and “Dumb” are simple, beau­
tiful pop-song structures with Krist 
Novoselic’s elegant bass lines laying the
framework and some of Cobain’s best 
lyrics filling in: from ‘Dumb,” “My heart 
is broke/ But I have some glue/ Help me 
inhale/And mend it with you/We’ll float 
around/ And hang out on clouds/ Then 
we’ll come down/ And have a hangover."
Recorded by Steve Albini, who has 
recorded everyone from PJ Harvey to 
local band Don Caballero, the record 
sounds clean but not slick. This aes­
thetic is repeated in the album’s accom­
panying artwork: there are pictures of 
shriveled babies and flowers and a 
transluscent woman with wings. On the 
inside, there are standard fanzine-look- 
ing black-and-white photos of the band 
playing and acting silly, accompanied 
by complete lyrics in an easy-to-read 
typeface. Cn :eamr probably will not sell 
as many copies as da”amFgnL, but all of 
the tracks are strong, and some of the 
kids will recognize that. It’s an extremely 
good record.
Some comparisons of Nirvana and 
Pearl Jam seem inevitable: both are 
from Seattle, both were important parts 
in the g-word marketing scheme, and 
both are fronted by articulate, charis­
matic, short men. But musically, few if 
any comparisons can be drawn. To lump 
these bands into “That Seattle Grunge 
Thing” is misleading and unfair to both. 
Nirvana is a power trio in every sense of 
the term; Pearl Jam’s five members make 
up a grander, more epic band, steeped 
more in mainstream 1970s rock than in 
punk.
©1993 Geffen Records, Inc.
The artwork on the Pearl Jam album 
reflects this fundamental difference. The 
inner sleeve has pictures of woods and 
shadows and masks on one side and 
mostly handwritten, incomplete lyrics 
on the other. The outside jacket folds 
open to a photo of the band sitting in a 
dark living room, lit only by glowing 
flames in a fireplace. The picture was 
probably unstaged; the band looks like 
they are working on a new song. The 
photo is telling in that Pearl Jam is fol­
lowing in the footsteps of ’60s and ’70s 
rock gods, but they are not necessarily 
trying to.
The music on the new record serves to 
push Pearl Jam even further into a pa­
radox as old as rock itself, that of being 
one of the best bands in rock music but 
not particularly wanting to be the big­
gest. It is both fortunate and unfortu­
nate, then, that %y, is such a good record 
— not only a progression from Wanw but 
a departure from it.
Pearl Jam takes risks on this album. 
Some, like the simple yet unbelievably 
poignant “Rearviewmirror,” work. Oth­
ers, like the too-epic storytelling of “Dis­
sident,” don’t. But the fact that a band as 
big as Pearl Jam refuses to rely on a 
proven formula is to be admired.
The album opens with “Go,” a hyper­
active tune urged on as much by Stone 
Gossard and Mike McCread/s gunning 
guitars as the tight, straightforward 
work by the rhythm section — Jeff 
Ament’s clean, simple bass lines, Dave 
Abbruzzese’s powerful, bottom-heavy 
drumming. Vedder's voice soars in the 
chorus, but in verses it dips down and 
becomes another instrument in the mix. 
“Animal” is a mid-tempo, straight-out 
rock song, and the album version is 
much better than last month’s live MTV 
Video Music Awards performance. The 
guitar work on this song is superb and 
manic, rangingfrom chunky rock riffs to 
straight funk effects.
“Daughter” is a mostly-acoustic, char­
acter-oriented song, somewhat reminis­
cent of “Crazy Mary,” Pearl Jam’s con­
tribution to the Victoria Williams ben­
efit album utaae ¡aUgap, “Glorified G” is 
a strange blend of pop and power, but 
not quite power pop. It’s not the best 
song on the record, but it’s interesting. 
The same holds true for “W.M.A.,” a web 
of tribal beats, soft, intricate guitar lines, 
and rich vocals mixed way down.
Thesecondhalfofthe album is consis­
tently strong, with only one dud, “Rats,” 
and even that song isn’t awful. “Elderly 
Woman...” is country-ish and subdued; 
“Leash” is anthemic rock at its best; 
“Blood” is crazed, driven by a funk gui­
tar line straight out of u1ope"w and “Indif­
ference” is a haunting way to end the 
album.
“Rearviewmirror” represents the best
of Pearl Jam’s risk-taking. The opening 
bass and guitar riffs feel surfy, tem­
pered by a fuzzy lead guitar line, and a 
simple, unpressured vocal melody. When 
the song pauses in the middle and comes 
back, building to a crescendo perfectly 
balanced between restraint and un­
bridled passion, it is without question 
the album’s finest moment.
When this record fails, or, rather, fails 
to triumph, it is a question of the band 
trying too hard. “Dissident” is a huge 
song, toying with rock cliches in a way 
that Pearl Jam normally does quite well 
— Wan was full of both clichés onL fresh 
power. But it doesn’t work here. Part of 
the problem is in the lyrics. Vedder’s 
strength as a lyricist is his ability to be 
impressionistic, to give detailed glimpses 
into unspecified situations. But in “Dis­
sident,” he tells a whole story and gives 
the listener very little room to imagine it 
for him or herself.
“Rats” is weak point, as well, though it 
begins and ends as one of the most inter­
esting songs on the record. Ament sets 
things up with a groovy funk-rap bass 
line, and Vedder goes along with it 
through the verses, hemming and haw­
ing nearly indecipherable lyrics at the 
bottom of his range. He blows it in the 
chorus, though, when he turns his vocal 
intensity all the way up. When he’s sing­
ing about a troubled child or a homeless 
man, this kind of push works. But when 
he applies his power to a heavy-handed 
rat/human metaphor, it’s just not effec­
tive.

seems well-suited to this record. The 
album sounds very immediate and close, 
in stark contrast to the fuzzy, far-away 
feel of Wan,
In fact, the entire album feels sponta­
neous, and, with a few exceptions, both 
fresh and familiar. It’s a fine follow-up to 
Wan — looser, more mature, and cer­
tainly not stuck in a rut. This record will 
definitely, permanently place Pearl Jam 
into the big leagues, whether they like it 
or not.
Sadly enough, the question of whether 
they like it or not is almost as important 
as the quality of the music itself, for both 
Nirvana and Pearl Jam. The reluctant 
rock star role has been played out time 
and time again, but it’s easy to under­
stand why performers may not want to 
be rock and roll messiahs. Does making 
good music and making a decent living 
off of that music make a band respon­
sible for the entirety of pop culture? 
Does it make a band responsible for 
saving a generation?
With its raw edges, Cn :eamr will prob­
ably weed the trendy altemateens out of 
Nirvana’s adoring throngs; Vs. will prob­
ably make Pearl Jam one of the biggest 
rock bands on the planet. Midnight 
record release parties at National Re­
cord Mart aside, though, both albums 
are great, responsible only to their own 
visions.
Both Nirvana and Pearl Jam deserve 
their prominent positions in the music 
industry. The question of whether they 
necessarily tone to be rock stars, though, 
remains unanswered.

New comics offer change
This week I’m reviewing two 
books rather than one. This past 
Wednesday I picked up two books, 
both of which I knew nothing 
about. The books are ­mrh1aew 
from Image comics and Extreme 
Studios, and dake 0anb joge1 
published by Dark Horse under 
the new imprint of LEGEND 
which I’ll explain later. Both 
books have similarities other than 
being first issues and coming out 
the same day. Both are $2.50 
which is a little steep for books“I 
joiow nothing about. They both 
seemed to be worth it, though, 
because they have a “The story 
thus far ...” blurb to fill in new 
readers such as myself. Also they 
both featured quotes from 
pretty famous literary 
works ,­mrh1ae hasexerpts 
from the book of Psalms 
from W1a 7gfUa and dake 
0an opens off with a quote 
from H.L. Mencken, who I 
read in A. P. American His­
tory. I never thought some­
one whose work I read in 
A.P. would be quoted in a 
comic so I couldn’t pass it 
up. So, even with the $2.50 
cover prices I picked up 
these two unfamiliar books 
because of the paragraphs 
filling me in on what al­
ready happened, and the 
nifty quotes.
From what I know, LEG­
END is a creator owned 
icon modeled after Image 
and Valiant but with some 
new twists. LEGEND is 
represented by an Easter 
Island head in the upper 
left-hand comer of the cover. It 
consists of John Byrne, Frank 
Miller, Mike Mignola, Paul 
Chadwick, and Dave- Gibbons. 
LEGEND will never expand to 
anyone other than those five. Also, 
LEGEND is not just for Dark 
Horse (although all books are 
being published by them cur­
rently) so LEGEND books could 
be published by any company the 
creator desires. In Byrne’s words, 
“LEGEND represent, then, not
Comic Book Chronicles__________By Jason Andracki
an indication of our commitment 
to partnership with any one pub­
lishing operation, but rather our 
commitment to excellence in com­
ics.” Many of the LEGEND books 
have already been around the 
dake 0anw zrn.maeaw andStrc zge8 
but now will bear the new Easter 
Island logo designed by Mignola.
As far as I know dake 0anb 
joge1w is the first book released
event in dake 0an was a big help 
to a new reader and I probably 
wouldn’t have boughtitifit wasn’t 
there. As usual it has the Byrne 
art that I’ve always admired and 
his cynical wit in the storyline. 
He seems to be more free with his 
sarcasm than in the past because 
this is a “mature readers” book. 
My favorite example of this is on 
page seven with a character wear­
ing a Superman t-shirt inside out 
as a night shirt. Speaking of pages 
a nice little touch in this book is 
thatthe page numbers are spelled 
out like “page seven” rather than 
just a “7.” I know it’s weird but I 
like it. Overall this is a pretty 
good book, but I think I’d enjoy a 
lot better if I was more familiar 
with the dake 0an and sup­
porting characters so I’ll prob­
ably be scouring the boxes for 
back issues to better enjoy this 
series.
Now on to ­mrh1ae, I gath­
ered from the “What Has Gone 
Before... ’’ blurb and editor notes 
that Prophet appeared in 
;rsnifUrrL #’s 2-5. This 
helped to explain where all the 
flashbacks came from. Just as 
with dake 0anb joge1w I think 
I’m going to be looking for back 
issues so I can keep up with 
this title. Even though I was a 
little confused, I still liked this 
book a lot. As with all Image 
books, this is a nice package ( 
although I didn’t see the point 
of a card-stock cover), and it 
has great art from Dan 
Panosian. I especially liked the 
dream sequence with the 
©1993 Dark Horse Comics quotes from Psalm 23. It was
with the new LEGEND icon and 
it continues right along with the 
previously non-LEGEND dake 
0an, I have always been a fan of 
John Byrne with his work at 
Marvel on W1a joneoyeg. jrsm 
and u1a9VsUB and especially his 
remodeling of the Superman leg­
end (no pun intended) at DC, so 
this was a perfect opportunity to 
jump on a' Byrne book that for 
some reason I never picked up. 
The blurb talking about previous
an interesting touch to have 
quotes from W1a 7gfUa and I’m 
looking forward to seeing where 
Eob Liefeld goes with this obvi­
ously religious character.
I would definitely recommend 
both these books to anyone whose 
looking to find something new to 
collect.
I’m just hoping the back issues 
aren’t too expensive because I 
really want to read more books 
like these two.
YOU ASKED FOR IT
Lughnasa pleases crowd

length away from the action on 
stage yet the actors were unaf­
fected by audience expression, 
laughter, or slight chatter. All 
actors spoke with authentic- 
sounding Irish accents that 
made the setting in County 
Donegal, Ireland mudh more 
believable. Serious moments 
were often broken by Aunt 
Maggie’s wise-cracks that light­
ened the mood throughout the 
play. Music and dance also liv­
ened the stage as the Mundys 
celebrated the magnificence of 
the radio.
Jacques Cartier’s direction of 
-on.gni Oe lsi1noyo was su­
perb. Although the action was 
limited to one set (the kitchen), 
Cartier directed the actors in 
such a way that they could step 
“outside” by simply stepping a 
few feet forward. While some 
characters were “outside,” the 
remaining characters “inside” 
carried on with their chores and 
chatter as if they were on a 
completely separate set. Fur­
thermore, Cartier directs the 
character of Michael particu­
larly well. The adult Michael not 
only narrates the play, but also 
says the lines of the boy Michael. 
Without careful direction, these 
aspects of -on.gni Oe lsi1noyo 
could be confusing, but Cartier 
doesn’t allow for any misunder­
standing and the play runs 
smoothly from scene to scene.
Apparently, the, audience as a 
whole was impressed by -on.gni 
Oe lsi1noyo as well. Just as the 
actors were concentrating on their 
roles, the focused expressions on 
the faces of many audience mem­
bers led me to believe that they 
too were in deep concentration 
over the characters, action, and 
plot of the play.
Audience laughter broke the 
seriousness of moments regu­
larly. Most of all, the applause 
before intermission, and espe­
cially at the end of the play, was 
the greatest indicator that the 
audience enjoyed -on.gni Oe 
lsi1noyo immensely. A number 
of audience members even gave 
the eight actors a standing ova­
tion at the final curtain call.
It’s not surprising that -on.S
gni Oe lsi1noyo won the 1992
Tony Award for Best Broad- ; 
way Play. Y
Although the play focuses Y 
on the lives of a poor Irish 
family during a summer 57 
years ago, playwright Friel 
turns seemingly plain and pe­
destrian incidents into a mas­
terfully written drama focused 
on the passion and fortitude of 
human relationships.

Ceddo
Well-known Sengalese filmmaker Ousmane 
Sembene (Emitai, Black Girl,Borum Sarret,Xala), 
called “one of the most remarkable artists in the 
world” by Newsweek, directed this 1977 film.
The film was banned upon release in Senegal 
because Sembene refused to give in to his 
government’s insistence that the film be spelled 
Cedo, the Europeanized version of the word. In his 
defense, Sembene declared publicly that “Africa 
will not be decolonized with foreign languages.”
The film shows the struggles of a small African 
village which experiences the usurping of their 
traditional king by the local Muslim religious 
leader who tries to turn the village citizens away 
from their ‘primitive’ beliefs to see the truth of 
Islam.
Another central complication in the story is the 
kidnapping of the princess, who waits, seemingly 
helpless, for someone to come and rescue her, 
watching several men die in the process of saving 
her. In the end it is she who must save herself and 
her village from destruction.
The film stars Tabara Ndiye, and Moustapha 
Yade, and is in Wolof with English subtitles.
At 5:45, 8,10:15 pm, and 12:30 am.
Friday, October 22
Last Action Hero
Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in this action film 
about an action-movie character who comes out of 
the movie to live in the world of real mortal people. 
He finds he has to deal with not being indestruc­
tible anymore, not being able to fight anyone or 
anything, and (gasp!) bleeding.
He meets a young boy in the real world who 
worships his on-screen figure, and who comes to be 
his friend in helping him survive in the non-movie 
world.
An interesting self-referential film if your into 
action movies. And hey, its Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
how could you pass him up if you’re an action- 
movie fan?
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Saturday, October 23Cliffhanger
Coming from the same summer action-adven- 
ture movie period as Last Action Hero, Cliffhanger 
stars America’s other action-movie favorite, 
Sylvester Stallone {Rocky, Rocky II, Rocky III, 
Rocky IV, etc. etc....).
Although this movie didn’t do as well as Last 
Action Hero, it’s still probably as worthwhile if 
you’re into this type of movie and you really like 
good ol’ “Yo! Adrienne!” Sly Stallone flicks.
This film is about survival (what a surprise!) on 
a rock climbing expedition. Sly is also actually 
supposed to show his soft side, so Stallone group­
ies beware.
At 6, 8:15,10:30 pm , and 12:45 am.
Sunday, October 24
Missile to the Moon
This 1959 movie comes to us by director Richard 
Cunha, creator of cinematic works of art such as 
Frankenstein’s Daughter and She Demons. Cunha 
must have had a really bad experience with a 
girlfiend or something to come out with so many 
movies about evil women.
This particular classic is an adaptation of that 
other film favorite, Cat Women of the Moon. An 
expedition to the moon finds it run by a sinister 
female, who presides over a planet full of moon- 
women. The spectacularly low budget of this film 
helps add to its aura of high cinema.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
