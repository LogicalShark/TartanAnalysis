ITHE TARTAN
Campus prepares for H1N1 First-year ban from Greek quad mere rumor; truth revealed
There are 477 dead in the 
U.S.; 7511 hospitalized; 51 
states and territories affected. 
The World Health Organiza­
tion (WHO) declared the situ­
ation an official pandemic in 
June. ’
Even first-year orientation 
has been altered in response to 
the growing concern. What’s 
got health officials shaky? 
Swine flu. H1N1.
The H1N1 influenza virus
is the predominant influenza 
virus in circulation worldwide 
according to the Centers for 
Disease and Control (CDC). 
Carnegie Mellon’s Student 
Health Services has already 
seen documented cases of 
H1N1. What’s more terrify­
ing? H1N1 is looking for you, 
the student between the ages 
of 5 and 24 years old.
According to the CDC, a 
theory for why this new virus 
attacks the younger genera­
tion is that older adults may 
carry forms of immunity while 
younger individuals may not 
carry antibodies to combat 
H1N1. The virus is spread 
through human-to-human 
contact and HlNl-contami- 
nated surfaces.
“Playfair was changed. 
There was less hand contact 
and students were not en­
couraged to shake hands at 
the ending portion,” said Tor- 
rey Brenner, an orientation 
counselor and a sophomore 
in the cognitive sciences de­
partment. “But I’m not really 
concerned. The quarantine of 
infected students makes me 
feel safe.”
Anita Barkin, director of 
the Carnegie Mellon Student 
Health Services, stated, “The 
issue is of high importance but 
exhibits light activity within 
the Carnegie Mellon commu­
nity.”
The American College 
Health Association (ACHA) 
drives most of the regulations 
for H1N1 prevention at uni­
versities like Carnegie Mel­
lon while keeping an active 
dialogue with the Coalition 
for Emerging Public Health 
Threats and Emergency Re­
sponse, for which Barkin 
serves as chairwoman. “There 
are two critical steps we’re 
taking. (A) Placing emphasis 
on the Vulnerable population’ 
with pre-existing conditions 
such as asthma or immune 
disorders. And (B) ensuring 
isolation of infected individu­
als to decrease the surge of 
new cases.”
The search for an H1N1 vac­
cine is underway at 11 sites 
across nine states. However, 
just clinical trials proceed 
while the general public must 
wait. “Only individuals di­
agnosed with influenza and 
those with serious underlying 
conditions should take Tami- 
flu and Relenza to prevent 
a shortage of supplies,” said 
Barkin. “Indiscriminate usage 
of these medications can also 
cause a prudent resistance 
amongst the population.”
While students enjoy the 
nice weather and greenery, 
H1N1 is just a moderate threat. 
Nonetheless, the upcoming 
winter months will drive stu­
dents inside to keep in close 
quarters and may spur an in­
crease in H1N1 infections.

At the end of every summer, 
Carnegie Mellon students re­
turn to a slightly altered campus: 
Construction projects have been 
started or completed, new poli­
cies and procedures have been 
put into place, and new students 
are exploring the grounds. One 
particular element of our cam­
pus, Greek life, experienced a 
multitude of changes.
Physically, the Greek quadran­
gle is unchanged. But two staple 
resident groups, the fraternities 
of Kappa Delta Rho and Theta Xi, 
are gone.
Sisters from the sororities of 
Delta Delta Delta and Kappa 
Kappa Gamma have quickly 
filled the halls once belonging to 
Kappa Delta Rho and Theta Xi, 
^respectively.
What resonated most with 
first-years and upperclassmen 
alike during last week’s Orienta­
tion festivities was an incorrect 
rumor floating around campus.
That rumor insinuated that 
first-year students were explic­
itly banned from the Greek quad­
rangle during Orientation, a' 
speculation that infuriated lead­
ers in the Greek community and 
first-years as well.
Such a rule would “lower num­
bers on the Greek quad, and fur­
ther make it harder for a frater­
nity to exist on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus,” said Urvit Goel, the 
most recent president of Kappa 
Delta Rho, when asked how this 
potential ban might affect Greek
life on campus. “It’s been tradi­
tion for [first-years] to get ac­
quainted with Greek life during 
Orientation week.”
However, the rumor was based 
on a misinterpretation of an es­
tablished rule that applies to all 
student organizations on cam­
pus. “None of that [the rumored 
ban] is true,” Director of Student 
Life Holly Hippensteel clarified 
to The Tartan. Student Life, Stu­
dent Activities, and the rest of the 
organizers of Orientation week 
“just communicated an existing 
policy.... There is a university 
policy that all student organiza­
tions should only participate in 
Orientation through sanctioned 
Orientation activities.”
But were fraternities, which 
typically host alcohol-free par­
ties that first-years can attend 
during Orientation, targeted spe­
cifically?
“Our expectation is that stu­
dent organizations overall would 
follow the policy — this was not 
just a Greek thing,” Hippensteel 
explained.
Before Hippensteel and Stu­
dent Life’s Coordinator of Greek 
Affairs Monica Bebie dispelled 
this rumor, however, much spec­
ulation floated around campus 
amid the university’s alleged rea­
sons for supposedly disallowing 
first-years to visit the quadrangle 
during Orientation.
“I believe that the universi­
ty’s [supposed] new policy that 
prevents first-years from going 
onto the frat quad is ill-advised,” 
said Lucian Cesca, president of 
the Student Dormitory Council.
“From what I have heard, this 
policy has encouraged first-years 
to attend parties off campus, 
mainly at Pitt, rather than stay 
on campus.”
Rather than staying on campus 
to explore other social events, 
where they would have had pro­
tection under the amnesty pro­
gram or Carnegie Mellon campus 
police, many first-years ventured 
off of the university’s grounds to 
look for parties.
Added Cesca, whose student 
organization’s mission is to im­
prove the quality of life of all stu­
dents living in on-campus dor­
mitories, “I feel that these risks 
could be more detrimental to the 
first-years’ Orientation than any­
thing that could come from going 
to the frat quad.”
It is possible that fraternities 
were spooked by the removal 
of Kappa Delta Rho and Theta 
Xi into misinterpreting the 
university’s reiteration of this 
existing policy.
“Orientation is just supposed 
to be about Orientation, not
parties. Fraternities and sorori­
ties aren’t supposed to be hosting 
[first-years],” Hippensteel added.
Several brothers of various 
fraternities on campus felt that, 
despite the rumored ban’s being 
false, all student organizations’ 
recruitment periods could be 
harmed by such strict rules im­
posed by Student Life and the or­
ganizers of Orientation week. “It 
is also a critical week for Greeks 
to recruit [potential] new mem- 
.bers,” said Goel.
Several members of the Inter­
fraternity Council (IFC), the self- 
governing body representing the 
on-campus fraternities, declined

Crime creeps closer to campus with recent armed robbery

Junior Staffwriter
In the early hours of Sunday, 
August 16, a Carnegie Mellon 
student was robbed at gunpoint 
at the intersection of Forbes Av­
enue and Margaret Morrison 
Street. This is not the first time 
a Carnegie Mellon student has 
been robbed; such an event dur­
ing the late hours of the night 
isn’t a foreign concept to Carn­
egie Mellon students.
However, most robberies of 
any sort have occurred off cam­
pus in the vicinity of Fifth Av­
enue, toward the University of 
Pittsburgh campus. This most re­
cent theft is the closest to campus 
an armed robbery has reportedly 
occurred.
Three men, presumably not 
Carnegie Mellon students, pulled 
up to the victim in a silver mini­
van, forced him to the ground 
with the use of a semi-automatic 
handgun, and consequently
forced him to provide his ATM 
PIN after stealing his wallet and 
cell phone. Noel Titus, a first-year 
engineering student, had been 
with friends on Margaret «Mor­
rison Street when he happened 
across the victim. He described 
the victim as an Asian male who 
was alone. Around 2:30 a.m., the 
victim asked Titus for the Uni­
versity Police’s number, but Titus 
was unable to help him.
According to Titus, the victim 
continued down Forbes Avenue, 
and ended up at the Cut. Here he 
encountered Christian Aponte, 
another first-year. Aponte was 
with friends when he decided to 
ask some Pi Kappa Alpha frater­
nity brothers if he could take part 
in painting the Fence on the Cut. 
While Aponte was painting, the 
robbery vicitm approached him 
and asked to borrow a cell phone 
to call the University Police. 
Within moments, the University 
Police were at the Fence to report 
the crime. Aponte, a first-year in
H&SS, described the incident as 
a reality check. He admitted to 
being naive about city robber­
ies and the possibility of being 
mugged. He said he will be tak­
ing more care to be vigilant.
“This occurrence is a good 
lesson about avoiding walking 
around by oneself at night,” said 
Anna Goddard, a senior philoso­
phy major and Mudge House 
community adviser.
“It is indeed a wake-up call to 
many who believe that this type 
of event would never happen to 
them personally. Though our 
campus is very different from 
the University of Pittsburgh’s, it 
is still an urban campus.” God­
dard acknowledged that Car­
negie Mellon is relatively safe 
in general, but she stated that 
“if a person wanders around 
alone anywhere at 2:30 a.m., the 
chances of finding oneself in a 
compromising situation are un­
fortunately increased.”
University Police are assisting
the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police in 
the investigation of this incident. 
Gary Scheimer of University Po­
lice, well recognized for his com­
munity and school education 
programming and expertise in 
criminal investigations, oversees 
tie Special Services Division.
When asked about Sunday’s 
incident, he said that University 
Police are also looking into a 
similar case, possibly linked to a 
robbery at the University of Pitts­
burgh about 10 days prior.
The Carnegie Mellon crime 
alert e-mail offered some crime 
prevention tips: avoid walking 
alone at night and use the uni­
versity shuttle or escort service, 
as well as SafeWalk, when pos­
sible; if the suspect is after your 
valuables, do not resist or con­
front him or her — instead, try to 
avoid a violent confrontation and 
possible injury; and report any 
suspicious incidents, persons, or 
vehicles to University Police at 
(412) 268-2323.

New dining options bring new vendor, changes to meal plans
DOMINIQUE DAVIS
Junior Staffwriter
If you have ever felt uninter­
ested or unsatisfied with the 
food selection at Carnegie Mel­
lon, get ready to have your in­
terest revitalized and your taste 
buds tingling.
For the past year and a half, 
the Dining Services Advisory 
Council, composed of students, 
staff, faculty members, and the 
director of Housing and Dining 
Services, has worked to improve 
dining options at Carnegie Mel­
lon by compiling feedback that 
they’ve received through e-mail, 
comment cards, and surveys. 
They used the information they 
gathered about food selection, 
quality, and customer service, 
and put a plan into action to 
ensure the campus community 
would be happy with the dining 
options this year.
A major part of this plan was 
hiring a new company, CulinArt, 
to create all-new dining venues 
and options. Downtown Deli,
previously known as East Street 
Deli, now has an upgraded sand­
wich station offering wraps, pa- 
ninis, melts, and a build-your- 
own sandwich option. Stir Crazy, 
formerly known as Bento Bowl, 
now offers new rice and noodle 
creations and dim sum meals. In 
addition to these upgraded ven-, 
ues, CulinArt has created some 
brand new locations. Spinning 
Salads offers fresh, tossed-to-or- 
der salads, where you pick your 
favorite veggies, proteins, and 
toppings. Totally Juiced is an all- 
new fresh fruit and juice bar that 
offers a variety of nutritious op­
tions. But the UC is not the only 
place that has undergone a din­
ing transformation.
The Resnik Café, which used 
to have only Taste of India, now 
also has Sushi Too, a traditional 
Japanese sushi restaurant; Take 
Comfort, which offers some se­
lections that will remind you of 
home, such as rotisserie chicken, 
meatloaf, and cornbread; and 
Spice It Up Grill, a premium 
grill station that offers a variety
of burgers during the day and 
more hearty selections at night, 
such as baby back ribs and jumbo 
shrimp.
“I wasn’t planning on getting a 
meal plan until I got back to cam­
pus and saw the great changes 
that were being made,” said 
Ashley Reid, a senior psychol­
ogy major and resident assistant 
who has gotten to eat from some 
of these venues over Orientation 
week.
In order to give you a taste 
of the many options available 
this year, CulinArt is hosting an 
event called “Taste of the Tar­
tans” on Sept. 8 from 11 a.m. to
2 p.m. in Rangos Hall. It is a free 
event that will allow the campus 
community to sample something 
from every dining location on 
campus.
“Our hope is to introduce 
members of the community to 
all of the dining services that are 
available and encourage them to 
not only be a customer but also

University receives distinguished honor and eager applause
CMU named ‘military friendly school’
Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper 
School of Business and H. John Heinz 
III College have been recognized on the 
2010 list of “Military Friendly Schools” by 
G.I. Jobs magazine.
The list was compiled through polling 
of over 7000 schools in the United States, 
honoring the top 15 percent that are 
doing the most to embrace veterans as 
students, according to a Carnegie Mellon 
news release.
Military veterans interested in pursuing 
careers in public service may also need to 
acquire advanced technology skills; the 
Heinz College is able to blend those disci­
plines for them.
This distinction is especially important 
now, said Rich McCormack, G.I. Jobs's
publisher, because the recently enacted 
Post-9/11 GI Bill has given veterans fi­
nancial aid to get an education.
G.I. Jobs magazine is published by 
Victory Media, a veteran-owned business 
headquartered in Pittsburgh.
The company also publishes The 
Guide to Military Friendly Schools and 
Military Spouse and Vetrepreneur maga­
zines, and annually rates the nation’s 
“Military Friendly Employers,” “Military 
Spouse Friendly Employers,” and 
“Best Corporations for Veteran-Owned 
Businesses.”
Pogopalooza wows by defying gravity
Pogopalooza is a four-day competi­
tion in Schenley Park, held last week- 
ent, showcasing the many tricks and 
jumps that can be performed on a 
pogo stick.
Sometimes flying as high as eight 
feet in the air, the most recent Pogoers 
wowed a crowd of over 300 as they 
pulled “Reverse Canadians” and 
“Supermans” on their pogo sticks.
Saturday’s competition featured 
a 15-year-old winning the Big Air 
Professional stunt portion of the com-* 
petition, which has been running for 
six years with no sight of slowing 
down. Some competitors were jump­
ing around on Carnegie Mellon’s
new BowGo stick, developed by the 
Robotics Institute.
The idea behind the technology 
suggests uses of building running and 
hopping robots that cover long dis­
tances and rough terrain, accomplish­
ing sometimes lifesaving tasks.
However, in the competition on 
Saturday, pogoers were accomplish­
ing life-threatening stunts; some were 
chasing the chance to clear nine feet 
in the air. No longer just a springy toy, 
the pogo stick was definitely a crowd- 
pleaser this past weekend.

Global Warming: Doing what the planet 
needs in Washington, Copenhagen, 
Pittsburgh, and tropical forests
The Basics: Doug Boucher will dis­
cuss the importance of the next four 
months in terms of taking action on 
global warming around the world.
Washington has the Senate debat­
ing dn the House-passed energy and 
climate bill, and Copenhagen is in nego­
tiations for a new treaty to make drastic 
reductions in greenhouse gases.
Boucher believes the G-20 meeting 
in Pittsburgh on Sept. 24-25 is key 
for both these events, since it is where 
President Obama and the leaders of the 
world’s largest economies could make a 
commitment to making the necessary 
investments to avoid the worst conse­
quences of climate change.
Boucher will explain why part of this 
commitment needs to be reducing trop­
ical deforestation, which is responsible 
for about 20 percent of global warming 
pollution.
The presentation will also weigh 
the balance of forces and the political 
dynamics that could lead to historic 
steps on climate change in the next few 
months — or to a failure to act that 
would have drastic consequences for 
the planet.
Doug Boucher joined the Union of 
Concerned Scientists (UCS) in July 
2007 as director of its Tropical Forests 
and Climate Initiative.
He is in charge of UCS’s work in 
the United States and in the interna­
tional climate change negotiations, on 
tropical deforestation and its role in 
climate change. He is based in UCS’s 
Washington office.
He has published widely on ecology 
and forest management issues, most re­
cently in Ecology, Science, Plant Ecology, 
Forest Ecology and Management, and 
the Bulletin of the Ecological Society of 
America. Boucher has a Ph.D. in ecol­
ogy and evolutionary biology from

University.

First-years not truly banned from Greek quad
FRAT, from A1
or were not available for com­
ment to The Tartan.
However, IFC Vice President 
of Community Relations Chris 
Niessl insisted that Greek life at 
Carnegie Mellon does indeed 
have a future. “I don’t feel like 
there’s a movement toward the 
overall squandering of Greek 
life, in particular, fraternity life
on campus,” he said.
Hippensteel and Bebie echoed 
this sentiment. In fact, the uni­
versity is “looking to expand” 
Greek life at Carnegie Mellon
— “there are 76 other groups na­
tionally that we’re going to look 
to” in the next two years, Bebie 
explained.
Hippensteel concluded, “Part 
of Orientation is knowing that 
there are these opportunities ...
and that all starts once the se­
mester starts.”
In next week’s issue of The Tartan, 
please look for a follow-up article 
'on the removal of Kappa Delta 
Rho and Theta Xi from the quad­
rangle, the addition of Delta Delta 
Delta and Kappa Kappa Gamma 
to it, and more on the future of 
Greek life at Carnegie Mellon.
This is the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house on the Greek Quad.

Dining options drastically increase this year
CULINART, fromAl
to give people a chance to learn 
about all the places that they 
can find dining locations,” said 
Kim Abel, director of Dining Ser­
vices.
All of these changes in meal 
options might make you wonder 
what changes have been made 
to the meal plans. There are 
three major changes: First is that 
DineX that is tied to your meal 
plan will last you the entire se­
mester, rather than disappearing 
and refilling every two weeks. 
“The goal of this [change] is to 
allow students more flexibility 
with how they use that money,” 
Abel said. Instead of students us­
ing all their DineX on cash-out 
weekends because they have to, 
they can wait to purchase things 
that they actually want.
Secondly, in addition to the 
traditional plans — the red, blue, 
and green plans — and the DineX 
only plans, there is now a com­
munity plan. These plans allow
you a certain number of meals 
per semester. Again, instead of 
eating meals because you don’t 
want to waste them, this plan al­
lows you to only eat meals when 
you really want them.
Lastly, each of the meal plans 
now allows you to have two guest 
meals per semester. This means 
that you can now use your meal 
plan twice to take someone else 
out. Abel admits that this is not 
a lot, “but we are piloting to see 
how well it is received.” Remem­
ber that you don’t just have to use 
your DineX on campus. DineX 
can also be used at the Subway 
on Craig Street, the Eat ’n Park on 
Murray Avenue, and for Vocelli’s 
Pizza. Coming in September, all 
campus-owned residence halls 
will have vending machines that 
will accept DineX also.
Another exciting addition to 
our dining places is entertain­
ment. With karaoke, open mic, 
trivia night, and movie mara­
thons, “these locations will no 
longer be just places to eat. They
will be places to experience life 
at Carnegie Mellon,” Abel said.
When asked if she was excited 
for the dining options this year, 
Tina Robinson, a senior directing 
major, said, “I can’t wait! It seems 
like Carnegie Mellon has really 
stepped it up and I’m excited for 
the changes that are coming. The 
food looks great.”
Dining at Carnegie Mellon has 
undergone a thorough transfor­
mation and the people at Hous­
ing and Dining Services under­
stand that often with change 
comes discontent.
It is important to understand 
that student input is critical in 
decisions about dining. Housing 
and Dining is launching a cen­
tralized customer feedback pro­
cess so that anyone can give their 
feedback and it can be shared 
with the vendors. Students who 
would like to take a more active 
role can visit the Housing and 
Dining Services office and ask to 
be a part of the Dining Services 
Advisory Council.

Cancer drug research sees breakthrough
EDMUND HUBER
Staffwriter
During the month-long life of D. melano- 
gaster, or the common fruit fly, the expres­
sion of its genes changes in dramatic ways 
to accommodate the differing needs of the 
organism.
In what is called a gene regulatory net­
work, the expression of one gene may be 
in part responsible for the changes in the 
expression level of other genes. These net­
works, apart from coordinating the develop­
ment of the organism, are also central to the 
functioning of certain diseases like cancers, 
in which the normal gene regulation of the 
cell is disrupted.
A better understanding of gene regula­
tory networks, and other complex systems, 
is being pioneered by the work of Eric Xing, 
an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon’s 
machine learning department, and his stu­
dents.
In the July proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences, Xing and his student 
Amr Ahmed presented TESLA, an algorithm 
for inferring the hidden relationships be­
tween variables over time.
In the majority of existing techniques used 
to understand relationships over time, a 
static network is inferred for each time step, 
from samples of the directly observable rela­
tionships.
However, in many problems of practical in­
terest, these relationships are not observable,
and “this hidden relationship is something 
that does exist, and has an influence on the 
behavior,” Xing said.
In contrast to other approaches, TESLA 
infers a network of evolving hidden relation­
ships without the requirement of being able 
to observe the relationships.
Xing and Ahmed applied their algorithm 
to the voting records of the U.S. Senate. Al­
though the accounts of individual Senators 
may not be complete or truthful, “if people 
are related, then their behavior will be simi­
lar,” Xing said. The inferred network, indeed, 
showed two large cliques, the Democratic 
and Republican Senators, bridged by a few 
moderate and independent Senators.
Similarly, the ways that different sets of 
genes interact are not well understood, yet 
“the data is a proxy to the unobservable to­
pology,” Xing explained.
Applying their algorithm to a set of sam­
ples of gene expression levels taken over the 
lifetime of a fruit fly, Xing and Ahmed were 
able to infer an evolving gene regulatory net­
work. The network showed great changes in 
toplogy corresponding to the different devel­
opmental stages of the larva, pupa, and adult 
fly.
Such studies of life science are not new for 
Xing.
“After I graduated with a degree in phys­
ics,” he said, “I decided to use my knowledge 
to study life systems, because there are a lot 
of interesting open problems, and the solu­
tions to those problems can improve human
health.”
For a time, he studied cancer and several 
other diseases.
' However, “it wasn’t enough to iet me study 
complex biological systems, because there is 
no way to complete all the experiments that 
you want to do with human life spans and 
limited resources, which is what brought me 
to computer science.”
Now, his formal training in biology helps 
him to understand the motivations and goals 
of computational biology.
The work in TESLA is a stepping stone to 
the even more complex issues in computa­
tional biology.
“For large organisms, a lot of cells have the 
same DNA, but act in a different way — we 
think that in different cell types, the gene 
networks are functioning differently,” said 
Song Le, a Lane Fellow in computational biol­
ogy at Carnegie Mellon who has been work­
ing with Xing.
By extending TESLA to include not only 
variations in time, but variations over space, 
Xing’s group hopes to shed light on cell dif­
ferentiation — the way that the individual 
cells of a multicellular organism know how 
they should develop, becoming neurons, 
liver cells, or other types of cells depending 
on where they are in the body.
The overarching aim of the group’s project, 
Le said, is “to provide a set of tools for biolo­
gists to use networks to generate hypotheses 
and do experiments — and to use experimen­
tal results to refine the model.”

Hepatitis C response 
aided by genetics
During treatment for hepa­
titis C, patients undergo a 48- 
week course of the antiviral 
drugs interferon and ribavirin. 
This treatment is much more 
successful in Americans of Eu­
ropean descent than in African- 
Americans.
A team at Duke University 
has discovered that the reason 
for the treatment’s varying ef­
fectiveness is not due to differ­
ing access to health care.
The team, led by David B. 
Goldstein and John McHutchi- 
son, uncovered a DNA coding 
site that is close to the gene 
for a special kind of interferon, 
known as interferon-lambda-3.
Some people have DNA unit 
T’s on both copies of the genome 
(one from each parent), C’s on 
both copies, or one T and one C.
People with the CC allele 
respond much better to the 
standard hepatitis treatment 
than people with the TT allele. 
Because the CC allele is more 
common in Europeans than in 
Africans, this explains part of 
the difference in response to 
the treatment between the two 
races.

Heroin cures heroin 
addiction
Researchers from Canada, 
led by Eugenia Oviedo-Joekes, 
reported that out of 226 heroin 
addicts in Montreal and Van­
couver, 54 percent of those who 
got oral methadone stayed away 
from drugs and continued treat­
ment for a year. However, 88 
percent who received diacetyl- 
morphine shots stayed on treat­
ment and did not take drugs for 
the same period of time.
Diacetylmorphine is an ac­
tive ingredient in heroin. Those 
who got the shots also cut back 
on illicit drugs by 67 percent, 
compared to 48 percent of those i 
who got the oral treatment 
(methadone). The shots were 
given in a proper medical set­
ting which, researchers claim, 
can lower risk of overdose and 
seizures.

Swine flu spreads 
to birds
Officials in Chile reported 
that swine flu has now started 
infecting birds. Experts claim 
that there is nothing to worry 
about, as the turkeys that have 
been infected have only shown 
mild symptoms. None of the 
birds have died and the virus 
does not appear to have mu­
tated into a more deadly form.
Until now, the H1N1 virus 
has proved to be highly infec­
tious but not more deadly than 
the seasonal flu. However, ex­
perts worry that the virus may 
combine with the avian flu vi­
rus, giving rise to a more deadly 
form of the disease.

New drug targets 
cancer stem cells
Researchers from the Massa­
chusetts Institute of Technology 
and the Broad Institute have 
discovered a new compound 
that can destroy breast cancer 
stem cells, which have previ­
ously resisted treatment and are 
thought to be the cause of recur­
rent cancers.
The scientists believe that 
this compound could be effec­
tive against cancer stem cells 
for different types of cancer.
Cancer stem cells are difficult 
to destroy and are also difficult 
to study in a laboratory. The 
group stabilized the cancer stem 
cells in order to study them and 
tested them with 16,000 chemi­
cal compounds, narrowing 
down to the one compound that 
was effective in killing them.

For architects, making
wooden models of their designs 
probably requires painstak­
ingly hard work. One first has 
to cut the wood, glue it or nail 
it together, and then start with 
the painting and fine detailing. 
Making such prototypes of their 
work is tedious even for art­
ists and engineers. It requires a 
large amount of time and effort 
just to make these small models. 
However, with a new technique, 
it is possible to create these de­
signs on the computer and then 
have a model of the design in 
one’s hands in just a matter of 
hours. These new machines, 
aptly called 3-D printers, allow 
models of objects to be “printed” 
based on a 3-D design.
3-D printers use simulations 
created on a computer and pro­
duce exact three-dimensional 
replicas of the simulations. As 
of now, 3-D printing is used to 
create models of newly designed 
products, and this technique 
has become so refined that the 
printers are even able to “print” 
prototypes with moving parts. 
Considering the fact that build­
ing conventional models would 
require days of painstaking 
labor, it is hard not to wonder 
how these printers manage to 
build something so complicated 
within a matter of hours.
Although 3-D printers re­
semble ink jet printers from the 
outside, their working is quite 
different. The initial 3-D design 
of the object has to be created 
on the computer. A variety of 
computer-aided design (CAD) 
software is available for this. 
The software helps analyze 
the shape of the object, breaks 
it down into layers, and deter­
mines the shape of each layer. 
Information regarding the shape 
of each layer is then sent to the 
3-D printer. The printer builds 
the object by printing individual 
layers and stacking them one on 
top of the other. The layers are 
extremely thin, and according 
to a paper from the EDUCAUSE 
Evolving Technologies Com­
mittee, thicknesses range from 
0.0035 to 0.007 inches. This 
concept of stacking layers can be 
used to build objects of virtually 
any size.
The only limiting factor is the 
size of the box of the printer — 
the bigger the box, the larger 
the object that can be produced. 
Again, depending on the size of 
the object that has to be printed, 
the time taken for the process to 
be completed varies from any­
where from one to 12 hours. 
Although this basic concept is 
the same for all types of 3-D 
printers, what makes each type 
unique is the way the layers are 
produced.
Printers employing the fused-
deposition modeling technique 
build layers using semi-molten 
plastic. The plastic used is acry- 
lonitrile butadiene styrene plas­
tic and is relatively non-toxic 
and durable. When the molten 
plastic comes out of the printer, 
it sticks to the layer below it as 
it hardens, and provides a con­
venient method of fusing the 
layers together. Since the plastic 
is molten, supports often need 
to be used to keep the layers in 
place, and once the plastic hard­
ens, these are removed.
The other type of printers are 
the powder-binder printers. The 
layers are made up of a powder 
that is similar to loose plaster. A 
printer head sprays the powder 
layer with some sort of binding 
glue and then the next layer is 
deposited on top. This process 
goes on until the object is built. 
The advantage of this method is 
that a variety of different ma­
terials can be used to make the 
powder. Hence, if one wants to 
make the model out of a specific 
material other than plastic, the 
powder-binding technique can 
prove to be extremely useful. In 
fact, according to an article on 
singularityhub.com, a European 
company called Shapeways has 
recently created a printer that 
can create objects made of stain­
less steel. With this new devel­
opment, the range of objects 
that can be created using such 
printers has expanded greatly.
Although the capabilities of 
such systems are tremendous, 
scientists are constantly trying* 
to make them even better. An 
article in New Scientist reports 
that researchers from the Uni­
versity of California at Berkeley 
are trying to build objects as 
complex as light bulbs from 3-D 
printers. The researchers plan 
to do this by building layers of 
semiconductor and conductor 
materials in such a way that the 
basic circuits are built as a part 
of the main body of the device. 
The team has already discovered 
how to print basic electronic 
components like transistors and 
capacitors. If they manage to 
“print” such a light bulb, they 
might soon look at more com­
plicated electronics like remote 
controls, cell phones, and ra­
dios.
With such projects in the pipe­
line, it is evident that this tech­
nology holds great prospects for 
the future. As of now, however, 
companies are constantly com­
ing up with ways to make 3-D 
printing more accessible to the 
general public. Shapeways has 
come up with a service that en­
ables users to submit their de­
signs online to Shapeways and 
Shapeways prints out the pro­
totypes for the users at a rather 
cheap cost. Such novel ideas 
have allowed this technology 
to be available for use to nearly 
everyone.

Plastic releases 
chemicals in oceans
According to a new study by 
scientists in Japan, plastic can 
decompose easily in oceans and 
release certain chemicals that 
could severely harm animals 
and even humans.
The scientists stimulated 
the decomposition of plastic in 
oceans at 86 degrees Fahren­
heit, and this resulted in the 
production of harmful chemi­
cals like bisphenol A (BPA) and 
PS oligomer.
Scientists expect this decom­
position to be much faster in 
natural oceans, as temperatures 
in oceans often go above 86 de­
grees Fahrenheit.
The scientists also analyzed 
samples from oceans in the 
United States, Japan, India, and 
Europe and found traces of such 
byproducts of plastic decompo­
sition.

Research gives new 
insight on evolution
Recent research shows that 
endosymbiosis of two prokary­
otic cells, which lack a nucleus, 
could have been the beginning 
of life on Earth. Through endo­
symbiosis, one cell can live in­
side another cell.
Earlier, only eukaryotic cells, 
cells that contain a nucleus, 
were known to undergo endo­
symbiosis.
This research, published in 
the journal Nature, shows that 
endosymbiosis of two groups of 
prokaryotes — actinobacteria 
and clostridia — led to the de­
velopment of the double-mem- 
braned cell.
Subgroups of these primitive 
cells then developed the ability 
to use oxygen and eventually 
gave rise to the modern-day or­
ganisms.

New screens stretch 
across surfaces
Scientists at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 
have developed LED display 
screens that can stretch over ob­
jects ranging from the sides of a 
car to the human body.
To create such screens, the 
scientists first fixed the light- 
emitting diodes (LEDs) onto a 
thin surface that was later dis­
solved using certain chemicals. 
The LEDs were held in place 
during the washing process and 
were later fixed onto a flexible 
plastic, glass, or rubber surface.
This novel technique com­
bines the flexibility achieved 
by using organic materials with 
the durability and brightness of 
LEDs.
The panels thus made are also 
nearly transparent and could be 
used on windows of vehicles.
The research was published 
in the journal Science.

NASA plans shuttle 
launch tomorrow
NASA Jias scheduled the 
launch of the space shuttle 
Discovery this Tuesday at 1:36
a.m.
NASA initially had to conduct 
tests to ensure that foam cover­
ing was staying on the tank of 
the shuttle.
These tests were done follow­
ing the incident with the shuttle 
Endeavour last month in which 
the foam fell off of the tank.
Although Endeavour did not 
suffer any other damage, foam 
damage created a hole in the 
wing of the space shuttle Co­
lumbia that led to its disintegra­
tion in 2003.
Tests on Discovery, however, 
revealed that the foam was in 
place.
Discovery will be on a 13-day 
mission to continue the con­
struction of the International 
Space Station.

Health Talk: Swine flu
J.W. RAMP
Publisher
With the recent swine flu scare, 
we decided to focus this edition of 
Health Talk on the disease. Below 
you will find general information 
regarding the disease, tips to pre­
vent it from spreading, and even 
first-hand experiences from oth­
ers that have had the flu.
What is the swine flu?
H1N1 is a new strain of influ­
enza virus currently infecting 
people worldwide. It was detected 
fn the United States in April of 
this year and has been classified 
a pandemic by the World Health 
Organization. Since the end of 
July, case counting has been 
discontinued due to inaccurate 
counting.
H1N1 has acquired the “swine 
flu” moniker because of two ge­
netic similarities to influenza 
viruses that occur normally in 
North American pigs. H1N1 also 
shares genes from viruses circu­
lating among both birds and hu­
mans — this is known as a qua­
druple reassortant virus.
Who is susceptible?
Epidemiological data collected 
by the Centers for Disease Con­
trol and Prevention (CDC) sug­
gests that susceptibility to the
H1N1 virus is irregularly skewed 
to people younger than 25, rather 
than the usual high risk for those 
65 years and older. This is most 
likely indicative of a pre-existing 
immunity to this strain of influ­
enza. There is still a higher rate 
of seniors becoming hospitalized, 
though, due to flu-related com­
plications that are not as serious 
among younger patients.
How does H1N1 spread?
It spreads in the same way as 
the seasonal flu — from person 
to person through coughing or 
sneezing by those infected. There 
is also the risk of becoming in­
fected by touching an object or 
surface that has been exposed to 
the virus.
What are the symptoms?
They include fever, cough, sore 
throat, a runny or stuffy nose, 
body aches, headache, chills, and 
fatigue.
When I was infected, the first 
three days were the worst with a 
temperature above 101 degrees, 
a bad cough; and a head that felt 
like it was twice its normal size. 
I slept 12 to, 14 hours a day and 
ended up feeling better by the 
fifth and sixth day.
People infected with H1N1 flu 
are able to infect others from a 
day before symptoms show up
to five to seven days after. You 
should stay home for at least 
seven days or until 24 hours after 
symptoms end.
If my roommate is infected, 
can I still go to class?
As long as you continue to prac­
tice precautionary behavior like 
washing your hands and keeping 
shared surfaces sanitized while 
monitoring your own health for 
flu symptoms, it should be fine to 
continue your daily activities.
Can I get infected with H1N1 
from eating pork?
No.
Are there vaccines available to 
prevent H1N1?
Flu vaccine production and 
testing is ongoing with five man­
ufacturers. The FDA expects to 
have around 50 million doses 
available by mid-October, con­
tinuing production to supply an­
other 150 million doses by the 
end of this year. Vaccination will 
most likely be a two-shot process, 
separated by a two-to-four-week 
wait between inoculations.
Remember three rules of stay­
ing healthy:
Wash your hands, cover your 
mouth and nose when you cough, 
and stay home if you’re sick.

First class air travel does not 
offer first class worthy perksFromTheEditorialBoard
of the engine drowns out all the tuba so­
los I listen to on planes all the time.
It also offers a six-way adjustable 
leather headrest, which was probably in­
stalled after a consultation with a chiro­
practor. Said chiropractor probably sug­
gested to AA that there is only one way 
to sleep on a plane: awkwardly and with 
one’s mouth agape. So it’s only logicaP 
to install something fancy-sounding and 
dysfunctional, but sounding like it could 
provide quality cervical and thoracic sup­
port.
It threw “additional leg room” in there, 
although we know that’s a given. To my 
knowledge, I don’t think there’s an aca­
demic paper on the relationship between 
length of posterior extremities and ten­
dency to order first-class tickets. Not a 
huge deciding factor.
One thing that is actually legitimate 
is that first-class customers get priority 
at check-in. Which would be really help­
ful in a time crunch since I do not have 
my own personal chauffeur and have to 
rely on public transportation to get to the 
airport. But these first-class divas and 
divos probably do. So there’s a catch-22 
for you.
In the end, VIP .air travel is mostly just a 
marketing executive’s ability to make un­
necessary nothingness look really good 
to you. So they can charge you more to 
feel superior. So airlines can further in­
gratiate class distinctions in society. So 
they can give you a hot towel pre-flight to 
wipe from your brow the filth of the hud­
dled, unwashed masses in coach behind 
you. No thanks. I’m sticking with my Lip- 
ton green tea and C-list orchestra.
asc»«.
In most areas of life, I am a snob. I lis­
ten to classical music on Deutsche Gram- 
mophon and other such labels, own two 
Burberry purses, and drink only the high- 
est-quality tea picked from foreign fields. 
But when it comes to airlines and flying, 
I proudly admit to being your run-of-the- 
mill, average-Joe commoner.
I don’t believe in luxury air travel. I 
dutifully sit in coach with my overstuffed 
carry-on taking up any leg space, sand­
wiched between your average back- 
to-school college kid and Midwestern 
mother of three going to visit her sister. 
I scoff at the wrinkled old ladies and 
businessmen who sit in first class, whose 
ugly Louis Vuitton purses and company 
per diem, respectively, could feed small 
towns. They fan themselves in annoyance 
and yabber on their iPhones because they 
can. They usually get their own flight at­
tendant who definitively pulls the cur­
tain separating first class and coach, as 
if to say, “Yes, we do have class divisions 
in society. And I have to fetch wine and 
hot towels for these idiots who paid a 
whole hell of a lot more to go to the same 
place.”
First class isn’t all that great. I could 
tell already by shuffling past the suit- 
wearing sky VIPs as I headed to my lowly 
seat in coach, but just to be sure, I looked 
on American Airlines’ website to see

Replacement of UC gallery disappointing
As upperclassmen may notice now that 
they have returned to campus, the Univer­
sity Center has gone through a number 
of changes over the summer. New food 
vendors mean new kiosks in the second- 
floor dining area, and the touchscreen 
information screens that were mounted 
on the wall next to the Information Desk 
have been removed. But the change that 
disappoints us is the changing of the UC 
Art Gallery into a conference room.
While we understand that conference 
rooms are a necessity on any university’s 
campus, especially a growing one like 
Carnegie Mellon’s, we are upset that the 
addition of a conference room had to 
'come at the expense of one of the few art 
galleries on campus.
Space for students to display their 
work on campus is always limited, espe­
cially for non-senior art students as well 
as those students who are not majoring 
in art. In addition, the UC Gallery was 
located in a common area for all of the 
campus community, allowing students to 
have their work seen by a diverse group 
of people who may never make it to the 
more out-of-the-way and less student 
work-focused Regina Gouger Miller Gal­
lery in Purnell.
A number of rooms already exist in the 
UC that could be used for meetings, in 
addition to numerous conference rooms 
already scattered in other academic 
buildings on campus. But creative spaces 
for students to show their work are not
available in many locations over the cam­
pus, and by getting rid of the gallery in 
the UC, the university is limiting the 
available spaces for art even more.
The removal of the UC Art Gallery is 
also strengthening the already-existing 
divisions between students of different 
majors by sectioning off any creative 
displays in Purnell and not allowing the 
rest of the campus to be easily exposed to 
them.
We hope thatjhe university will help 
students continue to find places on cam­
pus to display their work, and that it will 
not get rid of any more creative spaces 
on campus, no matter how important the 
university may think its need for confer­
ence rooms is.

All silliness of the Loop Bus aside, the 
bus was the brainchild of former student 
body president and vice president Jared' 
Itkowitz and Pooja Godbole. Its intention 
was to allow students to explore other 
Pittsburgh neighborhoods, something it 
has definitely accomplished as evidenced 
by the droves of people who ride the bus 
every weekend night. The bus also suc­
ceeded in significantly increasing the 
safety of students coming back home 
from a night out on the town. There is 
no longer a need to assign a designated 
driver, to get lost on the long walk back, 
or to wait outside for long periods of time 
for a taxi to come by. This may mean a de­
crease in profits for Yellow Cab and DDLi- 
mos, but it is definitely a plus for Carn­
egie Mellon students. The only thing that 
you need to do is follow the undoubtedly 
familiar crowds to the nearest corner bus 
stop and pull out your student ID.
Student government should be ap­
plauded for recognizing this student 
need and allowing students to more eas­
ily take a break from campus without any 
¦worries of how to get back home. The 
bus, modeled off Port Authority’s former 
UV Loop and Duquesne University’s SGA 
Loop, is likely to become a Carnegie Mel­
lon tradition. Its trial run last spring did 
not even last two full months. Yet the 
pictures taken, songs chanted, and un­
expected late-night encounters, as well 
as nights made just that much easier, 
all because of the Loop Bus, are already 
treasured by the faction of campus that 
has experienced its magic.

election as it was first announced has not 
changed. The world has seen that the 
people of Iran are capable of some of the 
largest and most spirited political pro­

Perhaps most importantly, we have 
seen that through modern technologies

something we might see again very soon, 
as neighboring nation Afghanistan held 
its elections last Wednesday, with a simi­

We hope that if the media blackout in 
Afghanistan does remain in place after 
the election, a similar outpouring of citi­
zen journalism is seen, so that the rest of 
the world can stay informed of the hap­
penings of the country and the results of 
the election.

what was occurring on the ground.
We applaud the citizen journalism 
that blossomed in Iran out of people’s 
desire to bring to the international stage 
the aftermath of the country’s suppos­

Iranians cast their votes in their coun­

morning, the Islamic Republic News

60 percent of the vote going to the incum­

The leading opposition candidate, Mir 
Hossein Mousavi, immediately warned 
Iranian citizens of possible election fraud, 
and his supporters began protesting.
Hundreds of thousands of people pro­

and into July; unfortunately, the interna­

protests, having been forcibly exiled from

took place, and Twitter to post informa-
SABRINA PORTER
It’s 2 a.m., and every bar, club, and res­
taurant in Pittsburgh is'closing its doors. 
Cue the Loop Bus. Implemented as a trial 
run last semester, the Loop Bus was one 
of Carnegie Mellon’s most ingenious 
ideas.
Running on Fridays and Saturdays 
from 7 p.m. to that last 2 a.m. pickup, the 
Loop Bus takes students back and forth 
from the University Center turnaround 
to seven conveniently located Pittsburgh 
locations, including stops on Fifth and 
Forbes Avenues, and throughout Station 
Square and the SouthSide Works. It runs 
hourly from 7 to 9 and half-hourly from 
10:30 to 1:30 from the University Center, 
is free for all Carnegie Mellon students, 
and even allows each student one non­
student guest.
Its most popular run, no doubt, is that 
last 2 a.m. pickup throughout the South 
Side and Station Square. As a late-night 
rider, you will often see the same exact 
students that you left on the bus with 
earlier that evening. The bus is almost 
always filled to the door with even stand­
ing room cramped. Add to this cramped 
scene the sound of students sporadically 
singing loudly and in groups and taking 
bus seat pictures that they will most likely 
laugh at later. It all makes for an amusing 
ride, to say the least. The intense concen­
tration of people on the Loop Bus ensures 
that you will always see someone you 
know, whether from a different Greek 
house, student organization, or someone 
you just had never expected to see.
Each weekend, the Loop Bus has a dif­
ferent most popular location, as its stu­
dent population makes it a clear reflector 
of student culture. When the Penguins

the additional support, the city remains 
overly cautious about protecting its visi­

frustrated from permit denials that they 
have organized to speak to the members

Textbook rental programs would benefit students
HEATHER TOMKO
As college students, we all 
like to complain about money; 
namely, not having enough of it. 
Not only do we have a high cost 
of tuition, but we also have to 
pay for additional school-related 
costs, one of the most expensive 
of which is our textbooks.
Some people may get lucky 
and be able to buy their books 
from used books sites online, or 
from other friends, which are 
generally much cheaper options; 
while other people (like me) may 
end up having to buy new copies 
from the bookstore, paying close 
to $300 for books for one class 
alone.
And after the class is over, how 
many times do students even 
crack open that book again? 
While I would agree that some 
books remain useful after the se­
mester has finished, many books, 
especially those for general edu­
cation classes or electives, will 
never again be used. Try as you 
might to sell them back to the 
bookstore, you will likely receive 
merely pennies of the original 
cost you paid for the books only a 
few months earlier.
It is this situation that has 
prompted a growing number of 
companies to begin renting out 
textbooks, an idea that may seem 
logical and obvious but ha$ never 
before been introduced. These 
companies allow people to rent 
textbooks for different periods of 
time — generally, either a semes­
ter or a year — for a small per­
centage of the full cost, and then 
decide if, at the end of the rental 
period, they would like to simply 
return the book or keep it and 
pay the remaining cost. Some of 
the rental companies even send 
you an online version of the first 
chapter to view immediately un­
til the textbook reaches you.
To me, it is an idea that makes
perfect sense. I mean, there are 
libraries where we can rent other, 
non-textbook books for a shorter 
period of time, and there are 
places like Blockbuster, Family 
Video, or Redbox where we can 
rent movies or television series to 
watch so that we don’t have to ac­
tually buy them. So why not rent 
textbooks as well?
People like the idea of renting 
before purchasing mainly because 
they like the ease and comfort of 
finding out if they like something, 
or if they think it will be useful, 
before they spend more money 
on it. This is even more true with 
college student» and textbooks: 
Not only are textbooks exorbi­
tantly expensive, but college stu­
dents are more stingy with their 
money than most — hey, we need 
to have some money left for the 
weekends!
In many cases, professors ás- 
sign a textbook but end up only 
referencing it once or twice, or 
only assigning homework prob­
lems from it, and instead provide 
their own notes, often more de­
tailed and more applicable than 
the book anyway.
Another argument in support 
of purchasing your books is that 
you then can keep them forever 
and easily reference them any 
time in the future, either in your 
education or your career. But for 
students who are taking general 
education classes simply to fill 
up the required open slots, it is 
highly unlikely that they will ever 
need to reference the book in the 
future.
In addition, with the growing 
amount of máterial on the Inter­
net, it is also very unlikely that 
students will need to find some­
thing in a book that they couldn’t 
find elsewhere online. I know 
that when I took a psychology 
class over the summer, Wikipedia 
was just about as helpful as the 
book itself in explaining different 
psychological theories and stud­
ies. And many professors from 
a number of universities actu­
ally post their class notes online,
which can be found by a quick 
Google search.
Textbooks are no longer the 
only source of information about 
a subject, and they are not even 
necessarily the easiest way to find 
that information, either. Thus, if 
textbooks are no longer as useful 
as they used to be, at least after a 
class is oyer, why are they some­
thing that should continue to be 
held on to?
And even when'textbooks were 
the easiest way to look up infor­
mation about a certain subject, 
how often are those books actu­
ally referenced? My parents have 
boxes of old schoolbooks in our 
basement that are never looked 
at other than the occasional 
times we pull them out to laugh
at the notes my parents made in 
the margins. Because textbooks 
can’t update themselves as the 
Internet can, the information 
quickly becomes outdated and ir­
relevant, anyway.
So renting textbooks with the 
option to purchase them later as 
well seems like the perfect solu­
tion.
For those classes where the 
book is barely ever used, you get 
to pay a fraction of even the used- 
book cost and clear up space in 
your tiny room when the class is 
finished. Even in this worst-case 
scenario, you’re still paying less 
than you would to buy the book. 
If you did get a lot of use out of the 
book but don’t think that you’ll 
ever use it in the future, you’ll at
least feel like your rental fee was 
justified. And if you use the book 
a lot and think it would be useful 
to you in future classes, you can 
just decide to buy it when your 
time is up, without having to de­
cide before'the class even starts if 
the book will be helpful or not.
I appreciate that by renting out 
textbooks, companies are look­
ing out not only for their own 
interests, but for the interests of 
students as well, by providing a 
service that is beneficial to both 
sides.

Vick’s sports future should be determined by his past actions
ALEX YUSCHIK
Though newspapers and edi­
torials have feasted upon the sad 
story of Michael Vick, his animal 
abuse, and whether his apology is 
genuine, it seems as though those 
authors clamoring for the public 
to accept his apology and let the 
guy play his season out seem to be 
overlooking a few key points.
•First, authors supporting Vick’s 
return argue that though football 
fans and animal activists are en­
titled to some genuine outrage at 
Vick’s actions, there is no reason 
to bar him from playing football 
or make his case into a scandal. 
Other athletes haven’t been skew­
ered by the media half so much 
for their indiscretions, especially 
those involving spousal abuse. If 
they aren’t getting as much media 
scrutiny for their graver offenses, 
then what right do people have to 
prey on Vick?
It appears that these authors 
skate over the fact that Vick, as 
well as other players, have com­
mitted- serious crimes. In my 
book, justice deserves to be met­
ed out both to those who were 
hurt by and those who committed 
that crime. If other athletes aren’t 
being hounded as much as Vick 
about their pasts, then maybe it’s 
time that they should be. People 
who are famous, whether for be­
ing an athlete, a movie star, or 
just for being well-known, ought 
to be treated the same as anyone 
else in the eyes of the law.
Maybe if we started to hold our 
athletes and idols to a higher stan­
dard, then they wouldn’t commit 
the crimes in the first place. If 
abusing a wife, child, or animal 
meant losing your spot on the 
team, no matter how much of a 
skilled player you were, then that 
might have some serious effects 
on how these players conduct 
themselves.
However, the suggestion that 
the public drop the issue of Mi­
chael Vick just because other 
abuse cases haven’t gotten the 
same press coverage is just ludi­
crous. People should be paying 
more attention to the transgres­
sions of those in the limelight, not 
less.
A second point common to 
these editorials is the view that 
Vick has served his time, made 
his apology, and ought to be left
alone. I disagree. When you have 
committed an abuse like that, ei­
ther ending in the bodily or emo­
tional harm or death of another 
being, then you really ought to 
be reminded of it all the time. It 
shouldn’t be an easy thing to live 
with taking the life of another 
creature, whether it’s a dog, cat, 
or human.
Vick does not deserve to be 
spared any of the spotlight; he 
should not be allowed to for­
get what he’s done, and neither 
should the public. Sports stars 
are put on high pedestals and 
admired, and they need to know 
that they don’t get special treat­
ment just because they can play 
the game well.
Last, these authors appeal to 
their .audience’s idealism, stat­
ing that Vick, though he has 
done wrong, has shown enough 
remorse and ought to be given a 
second chance. They also point to 
his efforts with the Humane Soci­
ety as proof of his contrition and 
well-meaning.
But, this leads me to ask: what 
qualifies as “enough” remorse? A 
quick Internet sea’rch of Michael 
Vick will show various studies, 
some more legitimate than oth­
ers, claiming to have figured out
what percentage of “truth” or 
“remorse” was in Vick’s apology. 
Is remorse really something that’s 
measurable and absolute, or is 
it subjective for each person? If 
someone tells us that a man’s 
remorse has passed the pivotal 
point of believability, are we to 
trust them or draw our own con­
clusions?
Michael Vick has also had a 
swarm of image-saving publicists 
at his beck and call, to help him 
get out of his sticky legal situation 
without setting off a conflagra­
tion of fan outrage. This should 
set off alarm bells for those seek­
ing to know if he’s telling the 
truth. If someone else has to tell 
you what the words coming from 
the bottom of your heart are, then 
chances are you weren’t very re­
morseful in the first place.
And to those saying that he de­
serves a second chance, I say that 
those six dogs he killed deserve a 
second chance, too. Dogs and cats 
—r pets of all kinds — are capable 
of loving a human uncondition­
ally. They often end up trusting 
completely those that look after 
them, not out of necessity, but 
out of love. It’s rare that love is 
so freely given (as anyone trying 
to find it knows), and to hurt or
kill something that loves you just 
for feeding it or scratching behind 
its ears every now and then goes 
against every tenet of respect and 
affection we, aspeople, have been 
taught. Vick can feed as many 
homeless dogs as he likes; he can 
donate as many thousands of dol­
lars to shelters as he wishes, but 
the fact remains that he has acted 
against something powerless and 
defenseless, just because it “un­
derperformed.”
Michael Vick should not be al­
lowed to return to football, where 
he’ll make millions this year and 
soon forget about those animals 
he murdered. He should not be 
allowed to have a pampered life, 
living in an expensive house and 
pursued by fans clamoring for an 
autograph.
No, Vick should make repa­
rations for what he’s done. The 
course of his life should be altered 
as much as those of the dogs he 
killed: he shouldn’t be allowed to 
play football, get paid millions, 
and live the high life. Instead, 
he should be made to pay for his 
crimes.

Rotimi Abimbola & Adam Klein
As your Student Body Vice 
President, I would like to wel­
come both returning students 
and first-year students alike to 
another splendid year at Carnegie 
Mellon. As you embark on your 
studies and explore the many ex­
tracurricular that Carnegie Mel­
lon has to offer, it is important to 
remember that your Student Gov­
ernment representatives are here 
to help you and improve your ex­
perience whenever necessary.
Rotimi and I have been working 
diligently this summer to set the 
framework for our for the coming 
year’s initiatives and to ensure 
that the school year gets started 
on the right foot.
This year, we envision a Stu­
dent Government that will keep 
you connected with your repre­
sentatives, aim to aid you with 
the stresses of the current eco­
nomic situation, and, of course, 
establish á new order and tradi­
tion of school pride in our stu­
dents. Indeed, we hope that you 
will take full advantage of all the 
initiatives that we have planned 
this year.
On behalf of your Student Gov­
ernment, I would like to welcome 
all students into a new era of 
transparency and accountability. 
This year, Rotimi and I will stay 
connected with you using a va­
riety of web-based technologies, 
including the Mad Minute, which 
will be a short clip of Rotimi and I 
updating you about Student Gov­
ernment on our website, and ouf 
Twitter account. Please follow us 
on Twitter at AK2010cmuStuGov. 
In addition, we hope that you 
will provide Rotimi and me with 
constant feedback, either by e- 
mailing us or coming to our office 
hours, which will be announced 
soon.
In a continuation of our initia­
tives to boost Carnegie Mellon 
spirit, Rotimi and I are bringing 
you the Tartan Rewards Program, 
which will honor students who 
attend various athletic events 
on campus. In essence, the pro­
gram will reward you for being 
a loyal fan and dedicated Tartan. 
With a little more work and plan­
ning, this program will extend to 
events related to the fine arts and 
beyond!
Thanks to the support of the 
Athletic Department, the Career 
Center, and Carnegie Clan, we 
hope to bring you a number of ex­
citing events this year and tons of 
free prizes and food.
The first Tartan Rewards event 
kicks off with the first football 
game of the season on Sept. 5 at 
1 p.m. in Gesling Stadium. As the 
Orientation Reunion, this event 
will be a chance for first-years to 
relive the experience of Orienta­
tion whilé also cheering for the 
Tartan football team. I encourage 
all of you attend this inaugural 
event.
Until then, enjoy the first week

Jackson, Gauntner appointed as new assistant athletic directors
ELIZABETH HALDANE
. Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon director of athletics, 
Susan Bassett, has appointed Todd Jackson 
and Sara Gauntner as assistant directors of 
athletics, with Jackson heading intramurals 
and club sports and Gauntner heading the 
instructional programs and recreation.
“We believe that leading an active lifestyle 
is an integral part of the educational experi­
ence. By adding Todd and Sara to our leader­
ship team, we are confident we can provide

the most conducive environment for recre­
ational participation for all members of the 
Carnegie Mellon family,” Bassett said.
Gauntner remains the director of aquat­
ics and assistant men’s and women’s swim­
ming and diving coach, and Jackson will also 
become the director of intramurals to replace 
Mike Mastroianni. Mastroianni left Carnegie 
Mellon after a 23-year career with the athlet­
ics department to become director of athletics 
at Quaker Valley High School.
With the departure of Mastroianni, Bas­
sett decided to restructure the department 
and create two more vital positions that will 
continue to develop the fitness and wellness 
programs set in place.
Bassett expressed her enthusiasm for the 
new appointments, saying, “We are truly 
excited that Todd and Sara will lead our rec­
reational athletics programming to the next 
level. This area of our department serves 
90 percent of our student body as well as 
the campus community. This is a tremen­
dous opportunity to bring fresh ideas to the 
department and encourage more individuals 
to engage in an active lifestyle.”
Jackson comes to Carnegie Mellon with 
three years of experience at Cornell Uni­
versity as the Robert D. Kennedy director 
of intramural sports, and has worked with 
recreational services at his alma mater, the 
University of Connecticut, where he gradu­
ated with a master’s degree in education, and 
Nova Southeastern University.
“I’m looking forward to working with an out­
standing group of successful athletics depart­
ment staff members, and I’m really excited 
about the opportunity to become engaged in 
recreational programs that involve the entire 
Carnegie Mellon campus community,” Jack­
son said.
Gauntner inters her fourth year at Carn­
egie Mellon with involvement with aquatics 
and varsity swimming. Last season, she was a 
member of the University Athletic Association 
Men’s Swimming and Diving Coaching Staff 
of the Year.
With a master’s degree from the School of 
Sports Leadership at Duquesne University, it 
is clear that her leadership as a coach and on 
the logistical side of aquatics demonstrates 
her keen ability to enhance the facilities, 
programs, equipment, and overall fitness and 
wellness’experience at Carnegie Mellon.
“With this position, I am really looking for­
ward to working with more people on campus 
and trying to get as many students involved 
in recreation,” Gauntner said. “The athletic 
department, university programs staff in par­
ticular, is very dedicated in reaching out to 
our campus so we can provide them with 
many opportunities outside the classroom.”
As she looks to the future, she anticipates 
expanding the fitness programs offered and
hopes to “work closer with Donna Morosky 
[director of fitness] and Pattye Strager [oper­
ations manager and assistant director of fit­
ness] . They bring much experience in fitness 
and recreation and I have enjoyed my last 
four years with them. We all share the same 
passion and can bring all our ideas together, 
which will certainly benefit the students.” 
Since today is the first day of classes and 
¿he appointments are new as of last week, we 
can only look forward to the improvements in 
store for the spring semester.

Women’s soccer head coach Willard hires assistant Jennifer Myhre

The Carnegie Mellon athletics department has hired a new 
full-time assistant women’s soccer coach, filling the void left 
when former assistant Betsy Warren left after the end of last 
season. Entering her fourth season, head coach Sue Willard 
announced that Jennifer Myhre, most recently an assistant 
coach at Luther College for the 2008 season, will be the newest 
addition to the Tartans coaching staff.
“Jen was a very strong candidate for our assistant coaching 
position,” Coach Willard said. “She was excited and educated 
about what Carnegie Mellon offers its students in terms of aca­
demics and athletics. We also felt that Jen knows what it takes 
to be a successful student athlete because of her own academic 
and athletic pedigree.”
Myhre, who graduated summa cum laude from Messiah Col­
lege in Grantham, Pa. in 2008, brings lots of collegiate soccer 
experience to the Tartans. During her und£rgraduate career at 
Messiah, Myhre helped the Falcons to a Division III national 
championship in 2005, and another trip to the finals in 2007. 
Messiah also made it to the semifinal round in 2004 and 2006. 
As a student, Myhre received a bachelor of arts in sports and 
exercise science, concentrating in sports management, as well 
as a bachelor of science in accounting.
While at Luther, Coach Myhre helped the Norse to an 11-7-2 
finish in 2008. She has also coached at Northern York High 
School in Dillsburg, Pa., as well as at soccer camps at Messiah, 
Athletes in Action, and Soccer Academy Inc.
“It is an honor and privilege to be the assistant women’s soc-

cer coach at Carnegie Mellon University,” said Myhre in a press 
release on Carnegie Mellon’s Athletics website. “I value Carn­
egie Mellon’s commitment to provide student-athletes with an 
unparalleled education, where learning not only occurs in the 
classroom, but also out on the athletic fields. I am excited to be 
a part of a women’s soccer program and athletic department 
where there is a passion and enthusiasm to pursue excellence 
in all areas of life.”
“Jen has a great understanding of team and individual 
training and will be a valuable asset in recruiting prospective 
student-athletes to Carnegie Mellon,” added Coach Willard.
The fact that Coach Myhre is the third assistant coach in 
four years is essentially a non-issue, according to Tartans 
senior Casey Garth. Garth, who has been through the coach­
ing changes, said that although it takes time to adapt to a new 
assistant coach, she looks forward to working with Coach 
Myhre. “Jen brings a lot to our team; she not only has NCAA 
experience, but she has an NCAA championship under her belt, 
so she clearly knows what it takes to win. Jen was a great player 
and her technical ability has really been beneficial to the team 
thus far. I have been fortunate enough to play under three very 
talented assistant coaches Tony [Mohamed], Betsy [Warren],
, and now Jen, and I am really excited about wc>rking with Jen 
this year, and she has the knowledge and skills to help lead us 
to NCAAs.”
Dancing with the Olympians appears to be a more accurate name
COURTNEY CHIN
Staffwriter
The popular show Dancing With 
the Stars pits B-list celebrities with 
professional dancers in an exciting 
dance contest of skill and grace. Peo­
ple we adore from a wide variety of 
professions practice for hours each 
week to so we can watch them fox­
trot, tango, and samba toward the 
finale. However, the past eight sea­
sons have shown athletes dominating 
the competition, with three former 
Olympians taking home the gold and 
three other winners being former 
athletes of sorts. So in a show about 
being creative and showy, why do 
athletes dominate the competition?
When one first thinks of dancing, 
one does not immediately compare 
the activity to exercise. But danc­
ing is all about movement and body 
expression, kind of like a nonstop
aerobic workout class. Preparation 
for any sport requires them to be 
stronger, faster, and more agile than 
the average person, especially if they 
are at the Olympic or world level. 
They train their bodies to last lon­
ger in competition so they can make 
the most out of those exhausting 
daily practices. Shawn Johnson, who 
won season eight, was an Olympic 
gymnast. Her superior flexibility, 
strength, and body control would 
make her an optimal candidate to 
quickly learn new dance moves each 
week and endure long hours of prac­
tice. Fourth season winner Apolo 
Anton Ohno was a former Winter 
Olympics speed skating champion 
with five medals on his belt. To be at 
the top of his sport, he would need 
incredible balance and agility.
In the fifth season, champion car 
racer Helio Castroneves took home 
the gold. Already, he would have
excellent motor skills, coordination, 
and focus. Also, in what would seem 
like the most obvious win, the sixth 
season saw Olympic medalist and 
world-renowned figure skater Kristi 
Yamaguchi breeze through the com­
petition to win. Also, we can’t forget 
former NFL Dallas Cowboy and Ari­
zona Cardinal runningback Emmitt 
Smith, who scored a touchdown in 
the final show of season three.
Seasoned athletes are also very 
strong mentally. Winning requires 
determination and a high level of 
concentration. In practice, athletes 
train to win and constantly push 
themselves to do better each time. 
Their routines must be regular and 
intense; otherwise they will never 
improve. Luckily for DWTS’s Olym­
pians, these mental skill sets can be 
applied to dancing, which may be 
why every Olympian on the show has 
taken home the trophy.
Despite their training in different 
sports, what most of the winners 
of Dancing With the Stars have in 
common is that they compete on a 
regular basis, and are trained to pull 
out a win in the most stressful of situ­
ations. Dancing also gives athletes 
new challenges that cater to their 
abilities. During sports, many situ­
ations arise where athletes have to 
get creative and find unusual ways 
to win. Each of their added physical 
advantages just made them stronger 
competitors on the show. As Ohno 
reassured Johnson during week 11, 
“You bring a total different mentality 
from the Olympic games, and being 
a competitor [and having skills] that 
nobody else possesses. That’s what’s 
going to give you an edge over the 
competition.”
Dancing with the Stars seems to be 
a contest of athletics and style. Since 
the professional dancers supply the
style part, any competitor who has a 
strong athletic background seems to 
be the obvious choice for succeeding. 
That is another reason why one can’t 
go wrong by becoming an athlete; 
skills gained from training and com­
petition alone can help in ways one 
cannot have possibly imagined. I’m 
sorry, actors and models. Looking 
pretty just won’t cut it for an activity 
that is mainly movement. Dancing, 
like any other sport, requires practice, 
flexibility, and stamina. Perhaps why 
so many Olympians join the show is 
because the training, practice, and 
learning new ways to move and con­
trol their bodies can carry back over 
to their original sport. Finally, three­
time gold medalist swimmer Natalie 
Coughlin will be competing on this 
season’s DWTS to bring the total 
Olympian count up to three.
ABC will premiere season nine on 
Sept. 21 at 8 p.m.

Brave an adventure every Saturday ' About getting sleep and saying “no”
Regardless of whether this summer was just a 
long snooze or a fast-paced adventure, getting 
back to the regular college grind might not be 
easy. The thoughts of picking up textbooks once 
again and midterms hovering on the horizon can 
be quite painful, and with the week spent with 
classes and the latter half of the weekend used to 
finish homework, enjoying a free Saturday seems 
to be the only light at the end of this long, dark 
tunnel.
While there are numerous options open to the 
student population at Carnegie Mellon for how to 
spend these special Saturdays, one of the most 
attractive, and definitely the most outdoorsy, 
ways is to utilize Pittsburgh Connections.
A program run by the Office of Student Activities, 
Pittsburgh Connections aims to mobilize students 
all over Western Pennsylvania by involving them 
in outdoor activities.
According to the Carnegie Mellon website, the 
program's main objectives are to “help students 
develop and maintain a physically active 
lifestyle, build leadership skills, and increase
their appreciation for the Western Pennsylvania
region.”
Allison Piper | Photo Staff
A group of first-years are prepared to get into the 
water to kayak.
The program hosts an Outdoor Adventure Series, 
which gives students an opportunity to travel to 
off-campus locations and take part in exciting 
activities at a partially subsidized fee. These 
activities take place every Saturday, and up to 40 
students can participate simultaneously.
Depending on the weather conditions, students 
can take their pick of which activities interest 
them most. Those fond of water sports can have 
some fun kayaking, snorkeling, or rafting. Others, 
who are interested in more rugged activities,.can 
opt for rock climbing, hiking, horseback riding, 
caving, and wilderness survival.
The program runs even during the cold 
Pittsburgh winter, and introduces activities like 
skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, and snow 
shoeing that prove apt for the weather. If none 
of these options appeal to you, there’s always 
paintballing or a scavenger hunt that are a little 
less in the outdoors and more in the fun.
Tickets for all these activities can be purchased 
at the University Center Information Desk. The 
schedule of activities for fall 2009 will be posted 
soon at http://www.studentafiairs.cmu.edu/ 
StudentActivities/pghconnections/outdoor.html, 
and students can contact pgh-connections@ for 
more information.
Dear Rohit,
I am not able to sleep for normal 
periods of time these days. My 
eyes open up just after four 
hours even though I am really 
tired. What should I do?
— Not Able to Properly Sleep 
Dear NAPS,
Your problem is not uncommon at 
Carnegie Mellon because of the 
workload for students here.
Your body gets used to a certain 
sleep pattern and it’s hard to break 
out of it, but not impossible, and 
that’s what I. am here to help you 
with.
First of all, avoid caffeine or energy 
drinks late at night. Try not to work 
out too late at night; you don’t want 
to be working on your muscles at 4 
a.m. in the gym.
Also, don’t do any other high-energy 
activities right before you go to 
sleep. Instead, try using whatever 
relaxes you.
I use Mozart’s symphonies to drift 
off — there’s nothing more beautiful 
and . calming. Also, avoid thinking 
about all the work you have pending 
for the next day. It doesn’t go away!
Finally, if all else fails, read course 
material from your most boring 
class, and you are guaranteed to 
doze right off.
Snore away,
— Rohit
Dear Rohit,
There is this boy who I have been 
friends with since high school. 
We love spending time with 
each other and everything was 
great until he started developing 
feelings for me.
I like him but I don’t want to 
date him. How can I say “not 
interested” without sounding 
rude and affecting our 
friendship?
— Emotionally Messed Up
Dear Messed Up,
This really is a mess. I sympathize 
with you because this is not even 
your fault, unless you count being 
too good a friend and irresistible.
There’s no easy way out of this 
situation, ar.d your best bet would be 
to tell him directly what the problem 
is and get him to understand why it 
wouldn’t work between you.
Throw in a few lines about how great 
a friend he has been and how you 
would always want him by your sic 3 
as a good buddy.
Things might get awkward for a 
bit, but in the longer run I am sure 
everything will get back to the 
perfect state of affairs they were, 
and then everyone’s happy.
Mess Sorted,
— Rohit

Tales from abroad: Munich
Discover the land of pretzel, or brezel, as they say in Germany
summer 
in Germany, and since it 
was a perfect sunny day, I had 
decided to go the beach, have 
some cold refreshments, and just 
relax. But, suddenly, the sun was 
too bright and I found myself looking 
for sunglasses... in my dorm room at 
5:30 a.m. While in Germany, the summer 
sun would unfailingly wake me up way 
before my alarm went off. And punctuality is a 
"characteristic of not just the German sun.
'
In order to reach my 8:30 a.m. class on time, I would 
ride an overflowing 7:15 a.m. S-Bahn to Marienplatz, 
the town center of Munich. The school children on 
the train would be happy and chatty, even at that hour, 
comparing notes and homework, while all the adults going 
to work would be wearing perfectly pressed suits and 
reading either the newspaper or a book.
Even as I walked through Sendlinger Tor at this early 
hour, I found myself in the company of shopkeepers and 
pharmacists. Most of the shops and drug stores would be 
open by half past seven. Admiring the German work ethic,
I would walk straight into a baeckeiei for some hot tea and 
freshly baked bread.
Baking is not just a major profession in Germany, it is also 
a significant part of their culture. I realized this when the 
only assigned project in my class was on bread. At first, my 
friends and I were ready to dismiss the project as silly, but 
soon we were to realize its purpose and importance. My 
classmates and I decided to meet at a bakery across the 
street right after class. I am sure the locals found it amusing 
to see a bunch of foreigners literally studying the different 
varieties of bread, with pen and paper in hand. After about 
half an hour of inspection, we left the bakery dissatisfied
___> 3
- ....................
with only 30 kinds of bread. We clearly needed more options. 
So, we spent the rest of the afternoon visiting many more 
bakeries, trying and testing the delicious breads.
In the land of brezel, or pretzel as we know it, there are over 
300 different varieties of bread to choose from. If you want 
to try some, you'd better go to a bakery in the first half of the 
day, because post lunch, most of it is usually sold out.
Variety is offered to you not only in bread, but almost 
everything else as well. In magnificent Munich, you will find 
something to do, no matter what your interests are: food, 
history, sports, music, engineering, or art.
On my first Saturday in Germany, I visited Dachau.
Dachau, located very close to Munich, used to be one of 
the concentration camps between 1933 and 1945. It was 
one of the bigger camps and the only one thatnever went 
kaput — until they all did, that is. As a result, a little over 2 
million prisoners were here at some point. As if the statistics 
weren’t enough, the gray clouds and the persistent rain 
continued to dampen my spirits, but somehow, that felt right.
First, I went to see the concentration camp museum.
It's a good start to the tour since it presents you with a 
mild introduction to the harsh reality. I say it was a mild 
introduction since some parts of the barricade were 
repainted and had displays of various items. Later, when I 
went to see the actual prison cells and the crematory, the 
darkness and emptiness stunned me. There’s something in 
there that makes you feel shock, sadness, and freedom.
Fortunately, this tor, or door, has been closed, which brings 
me to the second tor I encountered in Munich.
“Drei... Zwei... Eins... TOR\ (3... 2... 1... Goal!)" was the 
only chant reverberating throughout the Allianz Arena 
(pictured above, courtesy of author), a soccer stadium and
That's not the only time when I got an adrenaline rush in 
Munich. Other than beer and cars, the Germans are also 
famous for their autobahnen. An autobahn is a German 
federal highway, which is unlike any highway you see in 
other countries. Instead of having a maximum speed limi^ 
these highways have an unofficial minimum speed of 80 
mph. The lush, green, picturesque backdrop only makes the 
experience even more worthwhile. I still remember the thrill 
of driving at over 130 mph like I did yesterday.
Even though I was experiencing many firsts on my trip, 
toward the end of my stay, I found myself feeling comfortable 
in the local culture, so much so that eventually I started 
thinking in German. This was a big first for me, because 
in spite of my many travels, I have never experienced the 
culture of a country to have such a profound effect on me.
So, although I miss the brezel, the beer gardens, and the
S-bahns, I feel happy to carry a bit of Germany around with 
me.

also the home 
ground of Munich's 
two profession^ 
clubs, FC Bayern Munich and1 
TSV 1860 Munich. This imposing 
stadium, normally white, seats about 
70,000 fans. The unique characteristic off 
this stadium is its outer appearance. It is 3 
up red when FC Bayern Munich plays and blue 
when TSV 1860 Munich does.
Just visiting the stadium got my adrenaline flowing. I 
can’t imagine how it must be to actually play there. The 
electrifying atmosphere, the expectation, the team spirit! 
What more could you ask for? Only, perhaps, a win.

Pixar creates another hit
Up moves audiences with its storylineOn falling stars
This summer Pixar released Up, its 10th feature film. 
This film follows the story of Carl Fredricksen, a grouchy 
old man, and Russell, a persistent little boy, who travel 
to South America in a floating house.
The movie begins by showing Carl when he meets 
his future wife, Ellie, and how they bond over their 
love for adventure and their shared idol, the explorer 
Charles Muntz. Though their personalities are quite 
different with Carl being introverted and Ellie being 
very outgoing, they have a happy life growing old 
together. Throughout their marriage, the two share a 
dream of traveling to Paradise Falls in South America to 
explore like Muntz; however, they never quite make it to 
. Paradise Falls due to Ellie's illness that takes her away 
from the world.
The now bitter and lonely Carl is left alone in his 
house that is standing in the middle of a big city and 
surrounded by construction. Unable to keep his house, 
Carl decides to blow up 10,000 helium balloons to 
fly his house like an airship to Paradise Falls. As his 
house starts leaving the ground, Carl finds Russell, a 
Wilderness Explorer who is only missing the “assisting 
the elderly” badge.
Courtesy of Pixar
Cark and Russell's extraordinary adventure begins 
when they fly up into the sky in Carl's house with the
help of helium balloons.
Russell was accidentally taken up into the sky because 
he had been under Carl’s front porch trying to help Carl 
catch a wild beast in order to fulfill the requirements 
of this badge. From there on, Russell and Carl travel 
to South America, only to realize that they were one 
canyon away from Paradise Falls.
Upon arrival, Russell and Carl begin their own 
adventure filled with danger and a new set of unusual 
friends. Russell immediately bonds with an exotic 
bird that follows the two travelers, naming it Kevin.
Carl, meanwhile, is overwhelmed to find out that his 
childhood idol, Muntz, is in South America. But Muntz 
is not what he had expected. Muntz has become a man 
obsessed with capturing the very same exotic bird 
that Russell has become attached to, and is willing to 
destroy anything and anyone who gets in the way of 
what he wants.
Unfortunately, this means that when Carl and Russell 
decide to save Kevin and return the bird to her babies
— Russell hadn’t known it was a female bird when 
he named it — they are up against Muntz. On their 
trip, they team up with a talking dog named Dug, who 
should have been following Muntz’s orders and killed 
the duo, but decides to follow his heart instead. This 
crazy journey allows Carl and Russell to form a strange 
but loving family-like bond that Carl thought he had lost 
with Ellie.
This wonderful movie is a must see for all Pixar 
fans and anyone who is looking for an inspirational, 
heartwarming story and a good laugh.

i meant to write an article remembering Les Paul — rock and roll 
pioneer, solid-body inventor, someone for whom hokey grandiose 
terms like “icon” and “legend” hardly begin to suffice in description. 
After all, this was a man who still played a gig every Monday night in 
New York well into his 90s. What I didn’t mean (read: want) to do was 
talk about Michael Jackson. But the King of Pop has gone to sleep, 
and while the media is doing their best to puppeteer his post-mortem 
circus, the reality is he’s not waking up, and that’s a troublesome 
spoonful to swallow for many of us.
The incongruity between infamy and the affliction of being mortal is 
no news. There’s been screaming for years about “(our) idols being 
dead,” and while some of them may have left a legacy of literature, 
art, music, or what have you, the simple fact is that no one can ever 
really live on.
People love and hate untimely celebrity deaths because they are 
both spectacular and incredibly uncomfortable. Death is really the 
one event that brings cultural superstars back down to our playing 
fieid. As a result, we’re reminded of what French critic Charles du Bos 
called le réveil mortel, a concept that I think is well-described by author 
Julian Barnes as a sort of "wake-up call to mortality.” Now, if you’re like 
me, you experience this sensation at least once a day. Thankfully, the 
majority of pop-culture consuming population is not, and while there 
is a sort of reminder in some allusive lyrics or on elaborate TV hospital 
dramas, those points of reference are so filtered and far removed from 
reality that they generally lack any ability to cull a true reminder of 
the inevitable end. So, when one of the largest stars falls from the 
proverbial, celebrity sky, regardless of any bizarre circumstances or 
sensational rumors, there’s no denying the fact that that person is 
dead, as dead as all of us will someday be.
Our hope is, of course, that “someday” is later rather than sooner. Les 
Paul died, and while he was an incredibly famous and genius musician 
(etc.), his death came at a perfectly acceptable time. It’s Michael 
Jackson’s death that inspires that réveil mortel because he was 
only fifty, because he was about to do a massive tour, and because, 
frankly, the world wasn’t done with him yet. And that’s the same sort of 
unexpected “but my work’s not done here..." injustice that inspires our 
collective fear of death. We all have our own respective sold-out tours 
and untouched warehouses of wardrobe. It’s just that, in the end, we 
are afforded one thing no superstar can have: the courtesy of being 
able to slip out quietly.

Albums and concerts: Music to look forward to
New albums to watch out for; Gaslight Anthem and Japandroids come to Pittsburgh
The summer marks the separation of students at Carnegie „ 
Mellon as many go back to their hometowns and to a 
different culture, both musically and socially. However, as 
the student population returns to college, the reuniting of 
musical interests offers the ability for students to further their 
appreciation for music.
Apart from this intriguing reintegration into the Carnegie 
Mellon student population, there are several upcoming 
musical events that are equally interesting. Be it new albums 
or concerts in Pittsburgh, the fall semester has several 
appealing events.
Watch out before these hit stores 
Arctic Monkeys — Humbug
After a nearly two-year-long hiatus, the Arctic Monkeys have 
returned with their new album, Humbug. Expect an album 
filled with vigorous energy and over-stylized British accents 
as Humbug hits stores Tuesday. This new album might be 
the perfect back-to-school affair, giving students some upbeat 
shoetapping as they begin to buckle down for the upcoming 
semester. The band’s debut, Whatever People Say I Am,
That’s What I'm Not, was a high-energy album full of dance

tunes, so good that it was the fastest-selling debut album in 
British history. Although they hit the so-called sophomore 
slump with Favorite Worst Nightmare, expect the Arctic 
Monkeys to make a statement with Humbug.
While Humbug has me interested, there are some aspects 
that have me worried. The Arctic Monkeys have not 
attempted to truly augment portions of their sound to breathe 
new'air into their music. This is worrisome, as The Strokes 
were great with their debut but quickly died due to their 
constant recycling of the same signature sound.
Weezer — Raditude
Weezer’s rumored LP 7 is no longer a rumor and has entered 
the realm of reality, as the band releases its new album called 
Raditude. Weezer’s return to the mainstream last summer 
seems to have resulted in the return of Rivers Coumo’s 
writing passion. While Raditude is certainly a silly name, it 
definitely perpetuates Coumo’s trope, painting him as a nerdy, 
hopeless romantic. What is exciting about Raditude is that 
the new single “I Want You To" is one of the catchiest songs 
of Weezer’s career. "I Want You To" brings back the airier 
aspects of last year’s self-titled (red) album. Expect Raditude 
to land on Oct. 27.
The main troubling aspect about the new album is whether 
the other members of the band sing. The worst songs on 
last year’s Weezer LP were those sung by anyone not named 
Rivers Coumo. As much as Weezer is a band, Coumo is the 
definite leader and should be the sole voice of the band. The 
other troubling aspect of Raditude is whether Weezer is able 
to put enough creative songs into the album. The very fact 
that other people sang on last year’s LP showed that Coumo 
wasn't able to write enough great songs to fill the album. "I 
Want You To” is a great single, though not as good as last 
year’s “Pork and Beans."
Get down to buying these tickets 
The Gaslight Anthem
Playing their last few shows before heading into the studio 
to record their next album due early 2010, The Gaslight 
Anthem is returning to Pittsburgh merely months after its 
previous performance here. The band is scheduled to play 
once again at Mr. Small’s Theatre & Funhouse on Sept. 8, and 
they usually put on a great show. Having seen them live, The 
Gaslight Anthem does not disappoint. The headman, Brian 
Fallon, is a very entertaining host as he tells stories and jokes 
with a very humble attitude.
The only worry with seeing The Gaslight Anthem is that the 
band’s songs do not vary widely, though this is only a problem 
if the signature sound is not appealing to the listener.
Otherwise, there is no worry in seeing the group live, as 
their sound is much sharper and more energetic than in the 
studio. Fallon’s between-song banter can sometimes flesh out 
aspects of the songs, giving some of the more downtrodden 
songs much more emotion.

Japandroids guitarist Brian King plays energetically at a 
performance in Ottawa.
Japandroids
Japandroids is supporting its debut LP, Post-Nothing, 
by coming to Pittsburgh’s Garfield Artworks on Oct. 7. 
Japandroids is made up of Brian King on guitar and David 
Prowse on drums.
Their sound is an interesting mix of fuzzed-out guitar, 
attacking drums, and laid-back voice. While Japandroids 
takes cues from various areas in the indie music scene, the 
band's sound seems heavily similar to the garage punk of No 
Age's Nouns. Japandroids doesn't have an extensive foray 
into the music world. Because Post-Nothing is its first full 
LP, expect the band’s set to be relatively small. However, the 
relative newness of the band also makes its live sets oddly 
foretelling of its future sound.
As bands evolve, the stage offers a place to see how the 
audience reacts to inner struggles with their musical style. 
They might cover other bands' songs using their style, 
perhaps introduce new songs that they are working on for 
their sophomore LP, or possibly struggle on stage as they 
begin to receive more popularity. New bands always offer an 
interesting live show.

Looking back at summer films
Catch up on movies you might have missed this vacation
The summer of 2009 was a season that gave audiences 
some memorable blockbusters. There were billion-dollar 
action scenes, a journey into the criminal mind, and the 
never-ending exploration of the complexities of relationships. 
Following is a roundup of the highly anticipated favorites and 
an indie film that graced the silver screen.
Transformation
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, directed by Michael 
Bay and produced by Steven Spielberg, is the action-packed 
sequel to this dynamic duo’s 2007 blockbuster.
This comedic, heart-pounding film continues the story of 
Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) and his robotic yellow Camaro 
as they fight to save the world again. The frequent action 
sequences in Bay’s film are both easy to follow and visually 
stimulating.
With two hours and 30 minutes of college parties, pushy 
roommates, transforming cars, and Barack Obama references, 
it is no wonder that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen 
was one of the most successful movies at the box office this 
summer.
Trigger happy
Johnny Depp’s portrayal of the notorious bank robber and 
outlaw John Dillinger in the summer smash hit Public 
Enemies was nothing less than astounding. Not only did 
Depp embody the criminal nature of Dillinger, but he also 
captured the romance and thrill that this story offers.
Public Enemies — which revolves around crime in the 
Midwest during the 1930s — was filmed in high-definition 
digital, which allowed the detail in director Michael Mann’s 
shots to jump off the screen. Don’t be surprised if you see this 
technique in films to come.
But... I love you!
After riveting films like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen 
and Public Enemies, what could be much better? A romance, 
of course! Well, it wasn’t really a romance. 500 Days of 
Summer, directed by Marc Webb, is more like a love-me or 
love-me-not film. This film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and 
Zooey Deschanel and explores the reason why Summer 
(Deschanel) dumps Tom (Gordon-Levitt).
heart-fluttering moments and greeting cards — 500 Days 
of Summer is full of comedic relief. Webb’s film, which 
was featured in the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, was an 
undoubtedly remarkable tale of a relationship that led to 
self-discovery.
Same ol’ love story
While director Judd Apatow’s Funny People did not provide 
many laughs — just pity giggles — The Ugly Truth, directed 
by Robert Luketic, was a romantic comedy that actually 
evoked a genuine reaction.
Though this film wasn’t exactly original, it is always 
interesting to see the story of two people — Abby (Katherine 
Heigl) and Mike (Gerard Butler) — who start off hating each 
other and fall in love by the end of the film.

Man On Wire
Thursday, Aug. 27 
8 10 12
It’s a bird; it’s a plane; no, it’s... 
Philippe Petit? Yes; in 1974, Petit, 
a high-wire artist, attempted one of 
the most daring performances of 
the century: a walk 1368 feet in the 
air across a 140-foot gap between 
the World Trade Center’s twin 
towers. Designed as a “heist film,” 
this 2008 winner of the Academy 
Award for Best Documentary takes 
a behind-the-scenes look at Petit’s 
walk, including never-before-seen 
footage and still photos, along 
with interviews with many of those 
involved with the act. Fun Fact: The 
film is review aggregator Rotten 
Tomatoes’ best reviewed movie ever.
I Love You, Man
Friday, Aug. 28 
7:30 10 12:30
I Love You, Man is a comedy about 
one man’s search for a best man at his 
wedding. Paul Rudd plays a “girlfriend 
guy,” who has let all his male friends 
slip away while he concentrates on his 
relationships with women. So, he goes 
on a series of man-dates in order to 
make some male friends to improve 
his image. The movie follows a fairly 
standard formula, but the concept of 
bromances, along with the constant 
stream of fart jokes and innuendos, 
keeps the film fresh. Overall, I Love 
You, Man is well-cast and definitely 
does its job as a solid comedy.
Close Encounters of the 
Third Kind
Saturday, Aug. 29 
7:30 10 12:30 *
Although Steven Spielberg wrote and 
directed this science fiction smash hit 
in 1977, it still stands the test of time 
as one of the greatest sci-fi movies 
ever made. In it we follow Roy Neary, 
a common Joe who has a... close 
encounter of the third kind — you 
know, aliens and stuff. Well, the story 
comes to a head as Neary, along with 
the U.S. government and a team of - 
scientists, is drawn to an isolated 
area where they wait for (hopeful) first 
contact with extraterrestrials. The film is 
eternally hopeful and definitely one of the 
hallmarks of American cinema.

The Thing
Sunday, Aug. 30 
81012
The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film 
directed by John Carpenter, the man 
who brought you Halloween, and 
starring Kurt Russell. In it we follow 
pilot R. J. MacReady and a team of 
Antarctic scientists as they attempt to 
deal with “The Thing,” a parasitic life 
form that assimilates other organisms 
and then takes control of them. 
Although it performed poorly when 
first released, it has since gained a 
large cult following and is regarded 
as an intelligent scarefest filled with 
more than enough blood and gore to 
go around.

This year’s Orientation, like every year, had an inspiring theme that promoted enthusiasm and 
teamwork among the incoming first-years.
Unleashed, this year’s theme, saw everyone donning T-shirts that depicted Carnegie Mellon's 
mascot, Scotty, breaking free of its leash; symbolic of the idea that all first-years should break away 
from their fears and blend into college life.
Highlights from Orientation, including annual events like Convocation, Playfair, and House Wars, 
are pictured.

A small blurb in this issue, titled “Naming 
our ‘field,’” talks about christening 
the new field that has become a part 
of the campus. To avoid the default 
name of “Tech Field,” which the article 
states “suggests stubble, ash-heaps 
or tin cans according to the part of the 
country you come from,” The Tartan 
wishes to suggest names in its next 
issue so that a proper title can be 
given. The writer expresses concern 
that an unseemly name, no matter how 
unfitting, will stick.
This issue of The Tartan reports on 
the plans to build a new all-male dorm 
between Boss and McGill Houses. 
Now known as Hamerschlag, the dorm 
boasts of having a unique design that 
joins two wings with a social area in 
between. It is also planned to have a 
sun deck over this recreational space.
This week’s issue sports one of the 
longest headlines ever published. 
Located in the Features section, the 
title reads: “Information Age brings rapid 
and radical changes with onset; issues, 
areas affected include computers, labor, 
employment.” Guess there’s really no 
need to read the article now.
In the spirit of the Welcome Back issue 
of The Tartan, this week’s A Person’s 
Opinion asks students what they missed 
most about college life over the summer. 
Apart from standard answers like 
“seeing my friends” and “the campus,” 
one student said she missed “the cute 
football players” the most, while another 
said “not a lot.”
Although informative, AlcoholEdu is one 
of the most tedious things that first-years 
have to do once they finish Orientation. 
A long list of questions about alcohol 
consumption and associated hazards, 
AlcoholEdu was first introduced this 
year, much to the resentment of the 
present and future first-year classes.
The drinking age debate' now has some 
surprising supporters for lowering the 
age to 18: presidents of colleges like 
Dartmouth, Tufts, and Duke University. 
The rationale behind their argument is 
to legalize drinking for 18-year-olds to 
prevent deaths from alcohol poisoning.

Crunchy French Toast, Breakfast Specials prove very satisfying
Living in the "City of Champions" sometimes requires the 
breakfast of champions. Smallman Street Deli in Squirrel 
Hill, a kosher-style Jewish deli, is a great place for all meals, 
but their standout specialty is their breakfast. Whether it is 
pancakes, Crunchy French Toast, or the omelets, everyone 
walks away happy.
According to the employees, the most popular breakfast item 
is the Crunchy French Toast. The Challah bread is coated 
in a “crispy’’ mixture, dipped in the egg batter and grilled 
to a perfect golden brown. With a little syrup, this stuff is 
unbeatable. The little crunch on the top is followed by a warm, 
soft inside. No flavor is overpowered by another and it leaves 
the perfect aftertaste. It is easy to see why this is a customer 
favorite.
Among the other favorites are omelets, lox, and the two 
specials. The Murray Ave. Breakfast Special comes with 
two eggs, choice of breakfast meat (including corned beef 
or pastrami), hash browns, toast, and coffee. The Forbes 
Ave. Breakfast Special is identical except for the addition of 
pancakes or regular French toast. It is the perfect combination 
of carbs and proteins to start your day off right. Come hungry 
and/or hung over and you will be very pleased.
Aside from breakfast, the lunches make it a popular stop for 
businessmen, students, and regulars. They have dozens of 
sandwich meats to choose from, making decisions difficult.
A customer favorite is the Reuben, which many consider to 
be better than that from New York City. The food is so good 
at Smallman Street Deli that it won first place for best deli in 
Pittsburgh magazine’s 2009 Reader Poll.
The menu is modeled after the old Weinstein’s Deli that used 
to reside on Murray Avenue. The owners Bill Wedner and J,eff 
Cohen had a pretty good idea of what people wanted; their 
goal was to bring people back to their childhood memories
of going to the deli. In fact, the slogan of Smallman Street 
Deli is “deli the way it used to be.” They opened the original 
Smallman Street Deli in late 2000 on Smallman Street in the 
Strip District as a way to sell some of the products from their 
meat packing plant. Not expecting much success, it was a 
pleasant surprise when the lunchtime crowd made it one of 
the most popular places in the Strip District. Feeling the need 
to expand, they opened the second (and much larger) location 
in Squirrel Hill in 2005. Ever since, it has been a staple of the 
community, known for its great food and friendly atmosphere.
There are no frills about this place. The menu is written on a 
giant chalkboard that hangs over the deli counter that runs 
along the side of the restaurant and around to the eat-in 
counter.
There is no point in ignoring the elephant down the street. So 
here is a list of why someone should choose Smallman Street 
Deli over Pamela’s:
1. There is ample seating and you never have to wait for a 
table.
2. You don’t feel like a walking stick of butter after having 
their pancakes.
3. They sell six-packs of beer.
4. Nearly all products are made here in Pittsburgh or shipped 
fresh from New York City.
5. Students get 10 percent off any and all items (except the 
beer).
Brian Wade | Junior Staffwriter
Smallman Street Deli has two locations. One is located at 1912 
Murray Ave. in Squirrel Hill across the street from the Giant 
Eagle. The other is located at 2840 Smallman St. in the Strip 
District.

Good news: today you will find three mix tapes under your pillow from 
the mix tape fairy. One day your child will ask you what a mix tape is. 
You will have to give him/her the mix tape talk. When one hipster likes 
another hipster....
A wealthy property tycoon will try to force you off your land to build a 
highway. A team of boy scouts will join you in your fight to take down 
“the man.” However, in the end you will find out the “the man” is actually 
“the woman.” Tycoon is a sexually ambiguous word.
Dear Gemini, my love for you is like an undying bird. But only in the way 
that an undying bird is undying. It is actually unknown whether my love 
resembles a bird.
Make women happy! Enlarge your horoscope in seven days! To find out 
more information, find The Tartan's booth at the activities fair. The only

You will become a wealthy property tycoon this week. The only thing 
in your way is a stubborn resident and a possible sex change. The 
astrological signs have spoken.
In an attempt to be more spontaneous, you convert all of your shirts to 
sleeveless shirts, start a vlog, play poker with some Vietnamese men, 
and buy a sick duster. Wildcard.
Sitting in your underwear reading horoscopes and shaking your booty 
does not qualify as “dancing with the stars."
You will get a tattoo of a temporary tattoo and take an X-ray of a 
hologram. Delegate your work so you can fight a shark and make a 
popular dance fad.
You will wake up with a sore throat and an affinity for swine flu. For your 
information: Swine flu is not as delicious as swine.
You will win free food and things this week in an attempt by 
organizations who are trying to buy your love in the hopes that you are 
an impressionable first-year.
The first-years will appear visibly older this week, because their faces 
will reflect their broken dreams and lost aspirations. First-years, start 
lying about your age. Non-first-years, remember to stay away from 
jailbait.
You will either be sued by one large lawyer or one hundred small 
lawyers. Or attacked by killer bees. Or burned alive while drowning. Yes, 
it can happen. You will drown in oil or something equally flammable. 
Don't ask questions.
