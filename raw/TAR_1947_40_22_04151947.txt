dynamic Lecturer Featured 
/in Little Theatre April 29
In an all-out effort to revive student interest in the Tuesday 
assembly hour, Stanley March, director of public relations, has brought 
Arthur H. Motley from New York to discuss “Needs vs. Wants” in the 
Little Theatre on April 29 at 11:30.
“Red” Motley has been describ­
ed “the most dynamic speaker 
and most colorful personality in 
the newspaper world.”
He is publisher of Parade, a 
new weekly picture magazine ap­
pearing throughout the country 
and locally in the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette. Previously Mr. Mot­
ley, as publisher of the American 
Magazine, had been responsible 
for tripling the circulation and 
doubling the advertising volume 
of that publication.
Forceful Lecturer 
A forceful, inspiring lecturer, 
“Red” Motley will bring to the 
Little Theatre a wealth of 
thoughts and ideas that make him 
a must-see on the schedule of ev­
ery student. His theme, “Needs vs.

Secretary Needed
A secretary is needed for 
the Carnegie Technical, some­
one who is a competent typ­
ist and stenographer and can, 
in addition, administer the 
publication’s typing staff.
Janet Murray, the Technical’s 
present secretary, will inter­
view applicants in the Tech­
nical office on Saturday, 
April 19, at 1:30.
27 Representatives 
To Student Council 
To Be Selected
The Spring elections for twen­
ty-seven Student Council mem­
bers will be held on Tuesday, 
April 22. The Engineering School 
will have the largest representa­
tion with fifteen members. Fine 
Arts will elect seven members 
and MMCC will elect five. Four 
non-voting members are among 
those to be elected, two from 
MMCC and one each from Fine 
Arts and Engineering.
The original plan was to elect 
a completely new Student Coun­
cil. This plan was changed be­
cause of the amendment provid­
ing for two elections each year, 
and it was recommended that the 
Council members who were elect­
ed last January remain in office 
until next January’s election.
The balloting will be of the 
preferential type; registration 
cards must be presented. The vot­
ing will take place in three build­
ings: Engineering students will 
vote in Industries hall; Fine Arts 
and MMCC in their respective 
schools. Fine Arts students will 
vote for two groups, voting and 
non-voting members. The ballot 
instructions should be followed 
carefully.

SOMETHINGWBONG WITH 
A SCHOOL 
THAT WON'T 
STAND 
BEHIND ITS
TEAM /
“Do you want a winning foot­
ball team? If so, dig down deep 
and you can have one!” With that 
slogan the 1947 version of the 
drive for student contributions 
for scholarships got under way 
last Tuesday.
Those bottles that have been 
placed in strategic places in the 
Beanery and the Inn are not ash 
traps. They are there to receive 
help in putting CIT back on the 
football map. The members of 
the “C” club and the cheer lead­
ers that have been moving around 
during the noon hour with their 
palms extended are not pan-hand- 
lers. They are there to minimize 
the distance from the wallet to 
the coffers of the Steffen fund. 
Alumni Request
It all started with an open let­
ter from the Alumni Federation 
to the effect that, in order to 
field a good class B team to hold 
its own with such as Case, Buck- 
nell, Lehigh and W & J, would 
require $18,000 a year. They felt 
that if $3,000 of this could be 
raised by general solicitation the 
remainder could be obtained by a 
group of thirty active alumni 
through their own contributions 
and from their friends.
Gene Lucas then offered to con­
tribute $30 toward the cost of a 
campaign to raise student contri­
butions. He enlisted A1 Mitchell’s 
aid for the publicity and the cam­
paign was under way. The Kiltie 
band and the “C” club offered 
their assistance and now all that 
is left is for the students to “dig 
down deep.” •
Scottie Staff Reorganized; 
Lee Wiley Named New Editor
Scottie, the campus humor 
magazine, has undergone alter­
ations. With a new staff and a 
new organization the 1947-48 
Scottie has plans for making itself 
one of the best college humor 
magazines in the country.
The reorganization was com­
pleted last week, and the new 
board announced, following the 
retirement of the 1946-47 staff. 
The new editor-in-chief is Lee
Kaye, Long Play Songs
Dance, look, or listen to Johnny 
Long and Sammy Kaye at Spring 
Carnival
Johnny Long, now one of the 
most popular bandleaders in the 
country, began his musical career 
with violin lessons at the early 
age of five. After becoming an 
accomplished left-handed violin­
ist, Long switched tactics and be­
came a famous left-handed band­
leader.
He got his start at Duke univer­
sity where he made a big hit 
with his classmates. From there 
it was only a short step to a long 
term contract with the Decca rec­
ord company and an engagement 
at New York’s Roseland Ballroom. 
From then on, he was in.
Francey Lane, Long’s vocalist, 
has been with him for three years. 
In the way of vital statistics, she 
is a strawberry blonde weighing 
115 pounds and measuring five 
feet three inches tall. She is a 
native of Brownsville, Pa.
Francey is featured on Long’s 
new Signature records in White 
Star of Sigma Nu, his theme song, 
and one of his latest hits, How 
Are Things in Glocca Morra?
Sammy Kaye, who is playing 
for Spring Carnival’s Friday

civil engineering and football ca­
reer in favor of music. He organ­

a student at Ohio university and 
became so popular that he open-

Plans Being Outlined
This week is being devoted to 
the outlining of the plans for the 
next year. Next Tuesday’s Tartan 
will carry a full account of what 
can be expected under the new 
set-up.
The new staff is organized into 
twelve sub-departments, each 
with a manager responsible to one 
of four department heads who, 
with the editor, make up the ex­
ecutive board of the magazine. 
Executive Board 
Editor Wiley’s executive board 
has Deanie Miller as managing 
editor, Bill Bourke and Rex Va­
rese as associate editors, and 
Paul Waddle as business man­
ager.
The sub-department managers 
are: Bill Knightly, features editor; 
Sally Hutchinson, exchange ed­
itor; Ruth Ann Young, gossip ed­
itor; Bill Jordan, humor editor; 
Hap Hazard, art editor; Lewis 
Klein, photography editor; Tony 
Arrott, publicity director; Steve 
Nehez, personnel manager; Janet 
Duffett, office manager; Whitey 
Edema, advertising manager; and 
Ed Spires, circulation manager.
Help Wanted
Announcers and station en­
gineers are needed to work 
for radio station WCIT. Both 
women and men are wanted 
to aid in broadcasting pro­
grams; speaking parts are 
not limited to dramatic stu­
dents. All those interested are 
requested to appear at the 
radio room in the Fine Arts 
building between 4:15 and 
5:00 on Thursday, April 17.
All the money contributed will 
go to the Alumi Federation for di­
rect use for scholarships. This, in 
addition to the $15,000 that they 
already have, will allow the five- 
year plan to get started.
This five-year plan calls for 
six to eight five-hundred-dollar 
scholarships to be awarded each 
year. At the end of four years 
there should be twenty-four to 
thirty scholarship men on var­
sity teams. These scholarships will 
be offered to high school gradu­
ates who have athletic experience 
and ability as well as thé ability 
to meet the school scholastic re­
quirements. They will be awarded 
this financial assistance for the 
full four-year period. That is the 
reason for raising such a large 
amount of money.
Four-Year Help
The Alumni Federation wants 
to have enough at the beginning 
to assure full four-year help to 
each of these men and to keep 
this assurance in effect for five 
years. At the end of. this time 
winning teams will be the rule 
rather than the exception.
Clothing Classes 
Show Fashions
Kaufmann’s Department store, 
in cooperation with the clothing 
classes of Margaret Morrison Car­
negie College, will present an all­
cotton Fashion Show, sponsored 
by the Cotton Textile Institue, at 
3:30 April 18 and 19 in the elev­
enth floor Tea Room of Kauf­
mann’s.
The show displays five scenes; 
“Boy and Girl in the Sun,” “Boy 
and Girl Meet In Town,” “Boy 
and Girl Step Out Together,” 
“Moonlight Glows on Cotton,” and 
“Romance Has Flowered.”
Margaret Morrison 
Elects Officers
The results of the elections held 
in Margaret Morrison on Wednes­
day, April 9, have been announc­
ed. President of the Senate for 
next year is June Clarke, a jun­
ior in clothing and textile.
Elizabeth Moses, a Kappa and 
secretarial junior, will be vice- 
president. Betty Haggerty and 
Jeanne Gannon will take the posts 
of secretary and treasurer.
Officers of the new senior class 
are: Mary Roney, president; Phyl­
lis Grant, vice-president; Mar- 
garite Gautsch, secretary; Justine 
Garnie, treasurer and Mary Pat 
Bruso, Senate representative.

Scotch and Soda 
Almost Sells Out 
On First Day
Tickets for the Wednesday night 
performance of Rocic ’n’ Riot! 
went on sale yesterday, after all 
but about a hundred seats for the 
Thursday show were sold out 
within the first few days. Reserv­
ed seats for both nights were sold 
to students at the special rate of 
$1.20 per person.
Rock V Riot! marks the return 
of Scotch and Soda to the cam­
pus after a war-enforced absence 
of five years. Like the prewar 
S&S shows, Rock ’n’ Riot! is an 
original musical comedy written, 
cast, and produced by Carnegie 
Tech undergraduates. The com­
edy this year was written by 
Ernie Motyl and Dave Crantz, 
with music and lyrics by Kenny 
Welch and Howard Palmer. Mr. 
Lawrence Carra, member of the 
drama faculty* is the director.
Carnival Tickets 
Sell Out Fast
Spring Carnival tickets have 
been quickly bought up and are 
by this time all gone. The first 
two days 494 tickets were sold at 
Skibo alone and the sale to dis­
pose of the few remaining tickets 
was held on Tuesday, from 11:30 
to 1:30.
To clear up confusion relative 
to dress for the dances, the Car­
nival committee has announced 
that the Friday evening dance is 
informal, but Saturday’s dance is 
strictly formal.
Decorating for the carnival will 
start on Monday, April 21, at 7:00 
p. m. and will continue every 
night thereafter from 7:00 to 
12:00. Norbie Nathanson, able 
P&D directing the decorations 
committee, has promised a unique 
and exotic effect, embodying 
painting, construction, and light­
ing.
Elaborate plans including a 
special bandstand have already 
been drawn up but it will take 
the fullest student cooperation to 
realize these plans. The commit­
tee emphasizes the need of a great 
number of students to turn out 
regularly for work on the decora­
tions, as there is much to be done.
Henry V
Tickets for HENRY V, now 
playing at the Art Cinema, 
will be available at the special 
reduced rate until April 27. 
Students who desire tickets 
should go to Mrs. Tarbert in 
the public relations depart* 
ment, IH 246C.

Give Your Blood
The American Red Cross wants blood donors of all types, 
particularly for the Veterans’ Hospital in Aspinwall. There is 
a crying need for blood. The Red Cross won’t pay for blood, 
but we feel that students in fairly good physical condition 
should be willing to go to the trouble of giving their blood for 
veterans.
Appointment cards have been distributed :to fraternities, sor­
orities, and Citcom Clan. Students not belonging to any of these 
organizations can pick up cards in Dean Dickinson’s office, IH 152. 
Rats
We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again. Something must 
be done about the rats on campus. Last Thursday breakfasters 
in the Beanery were rather startled to notice a rat scurrying along 
the floor and vanishing underneath the drinking fountain. They 
weren’t too startled, however. It happened before. Such unsani­
tary conditions in the campus restaurant are simply intolerable.
We realize that getting rid of the rats in Skibo and the 
Beanery, not to mention the cockroaches, is a difficult problem, 
particularly because of the large numbers of rats in other places 
around the campus, but it must be done. Any restaurant that was 
frequented by rats would soon lose its clientele and probably 
also its permit to operate from the State Board of Health. The 
campus eating place, because of its monopolistic position, doesn’t 
lose student patronage. For this reason the rats must be elimin­
ated.
Our Democratic Campus
. And finally, get out and vote. Student Council elections 
will be held next Tuesday. We don’t care whom you vote for, 
but if you have an interest in campus affairs, we urge you 
very strongly to east your ballot for the men of your choice for 
:they will have charge of student affairs in the year to come.

I was inspired by a paragraph 
in yesterday’s issue of the Neu­
tron in which it was suggested 
that it would be appropriate to 
“erect a memorial to those hardy* 
brave students who won freedom 
from the despairs of Soc. Rel., to 
live happily and wealthily, com­
pletely ignorant of modern his­
tory, economics, literature, orig­
ins of the technical age, and hu­
man relations in industry.” I be­
lieve that you may have failed to 
do justice to their noble aspira­
tions, for they achieved ignorance 
in still other fields. But the idea 
is sound, and I would like to pro­
pose a suitable monument to com­
memorate these martyrs for the 
glorious cause of depression, war, 
and class struggle. Why not erect 
a gigantic chromium statue of an 
engineer couchant, attired ro­
mantically in the patched uni­
form of the great army of the un­
employed? The figure could be 
holding a golden slide rule and 
should be placed where its gen­
tle countenance can survey the 
inspiring ruins of Hiroshima — 
excuse me, I am a hundred years
behind, I meant to say Pittsburgh.
Respectfully submitted by the 
ghost of a scalped Soc Rel in­
structor,
Francis G. James.
Romantic Triangle
Dear Sir,
“Dear old Tech, Carnegie Tech, 
you’re the best of all the schools 
I ever—” phooey! To her clan 
the Scotch Alma Mater may be 
tops, but to me, the wife of a 
Tech junior, she is the new angle 
in a dark triangle that is casting 
its plaid shadow all over our 
happy twosome.
Ever since the old girl laid her 
scholastic fingers on my man, I’ve 
sat and burned while he caressed, 
not me, but his college sliderule. 
Aided by diabolical professors, 
Dame Tech cunningly wrecks ro­
mantic evenings and weekends by 
staging mechanics tests, seminar 
speeches, and Soc Rel papers. She 
has changed my husband to a 
monster bookworm. Once hand­
some and sound, he now crouches 
over his clipboard, pulling his 
hair and snarling blankly, “M 
equals x times D sub zero.” I lan­
guish by his elbow in trim house­
coat, but he, unimpressed, sits 
plotting other curves. Under her 
spell, instead of the sweet noth­
ings he used to murmur in my 
willing ears, only explanations of 
dynamics greet my bewildered 
face. Even Bob Hope is switched 
off the radio to douse our once
cheery apartment into the silence 
of a well-bred mausoleum,' so 
that my student mate can an­
swer Tech’s subtle call to study.
Unaware of her wiles, he in­
nocently expects loyalty from me 
to my rival. I am to grow misty- 
eyed at the strains of the Alma 
Mater. I am trotted over to a 
chilly supper at the Beanery to 
gaze lovingly with him at her 
queen candidate posters. Her 
mouthpiece, the Tartan, I must 
devour eagerly — each Scotch 
and Soda Shot, each Beanery 
Burp, and the Technical, I should 
snatch up like he would a copy 
of Esquire.
For pastime I cannot escape 
this campus poison. Her Men’s 
Glee club is an extra dose I must 
swallow. At rehearsal, tucking me 
cosily in one of 1600 empty seats, 
my husband joins fifty boys who 
shout at me their love for “Skibo.”
Gone is that Air Corps knight 
who vowed beneath a New Mexi­
can moon and three B-17’s that I 
was the only one. Lured he is by 
a middle-aged seductress, who, 
they say, also enfolds hundreds 
of other men in her capable arms. 
Dear, old Mater Tech. Some day 
when I go strolling down through 
Schenley, I am going to punch 
your shapely pillars and pull your 
ivy.

one assistant secretary. Therefore, 
twenty-seven members will have 
to be elected. Of these twenty- 
seven, two will be the assistant 
secretaries. Eleven present mem­
bers will serve until next Janu­
ary.
To determine which of the new­

two semesters and who will serve 
for only one semester, those per­
sons who are highest on the bal­
lots will serve for two semesters.

TUESDAY, AURIL 15, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
The Sounding Board
Nick Reed and Bob Johnson
Whether you know it or not, 
the Student Conference commit­
tee is the most important, perhaps 
the only, strong continuous link 
between the student body and the 
President. After attending a meet­
ing of this group last week we 
feel that there are definite defects 
in the operation of the committee, 
but that for the most part these 
defects are understandable and 
that it would not be impossible to 
remedy them.
Eliminating the sore spots of 
which we speak depends on two 
things: a fuller realization on the 
part of the committee members of 
the potentialities of this group and 
the awakening of the student body 
to the fact that these committee 
members are merely their repre­
sentatives and that what they ac­
complish reflects directly the en­
ergy of the student body and their 
interest in the school.
Aim of Committee
This committee should not be 
confused with the Student-Fac- 
ulty Liaison committee of the Col­
lege of Engineering, which con­
cerns itself with academic ques­
tions involving the faculty and 
curriculum of that college. The 
Student Conference committee is 
a completely ex-officio group 
chosen by Dr. Doherty. To 
make it most effective its mem­
bers are the heads of all major 
organizations on campus, who 
should have the best opportunity 
to hear the gripes and problems 
of the student body and in turn 
present them to Dr. Doherty. The 
President, for his part, is able to 
present to these leaders, and 
through them to the student body, 
the administration policy, and 
viewpoint oh the questions raised, 
and he is also able to sound out 
student ideas concerning his own 
problems.
Dinner Meeting 
The occasion of these meetings 
is a rather informal dinner given 
by Dr. Doherty about once a 
month in the private dining room 
adjacent to Skibo. The discussion
Cast Presented

The next production of the 
drama department will be Cor­

Witcher Young, graduate student

The play, which tells about the 
settling of the West and the Cali­
fornia gold rush, will run from 
April 15 to April 24 and will be 
directed by Mary Morris. The cast

is carried on in a very informal 
manner, most of it on a question 
and answer basis. No minutes are 
kept, and apparently the only 
written notes to leave the meet­
ing are those made by Dr. Do­
herty concerning the suggestions 
that are made to him.
Subjects of Discussion
The principal subjects of dis­
cussion at this meeting were, for 
the most part, old and familiar 
topics. They included football, the 
parking areas open to students, 
and the notation of each student’s

Since this was our first visit to 
a Student Conference committee 
meeting, we are in no position to 
judge whether or not it was typi­
cal, but from the comments we 
have heard since this meeting it 
was at least as fruitful as previ­
ous meetings, if not more so.
To us one of the most striking 
characteristics of this meeting 
was the hesitancy on the part of 
many of those in attendance to 
speak out and present the ideas 
they had — or should have had. 
We attribute this to several fac­
tors.
The thing which impressed us 
most particularly, however, was 
the apparent lack of preparation 
by the students who attended the 
meeting. That lack of preparation 
was evidenced to some extent by 
the lack of information on basic 
campus issues, issues on which 
we assumed that everyone, and 
particularly these leaders, would 
have a working knowledge.
After hearing many criticisms 
of the administration’s attitude 
from the students we supposed

Greeks Sing, 
Then Swing
The annual Greek Sing and 
Swing, for which all the frater­
nities and sororities have been 
preparing for months, will be held 
this weekend, with the singing 
competition at Carnegie Music 
hall on Friday night at 8:00, and 
the swing in the gym the following 
night at 9:00. Music will be sup­
plied by Bill LeRoy and his or­
chestra.
Tickets for both night’s affairs 
are restricted to members of fra­
ternities and sororities and will 
be distributed to the various 
groups prior to the events. Presi­
dent Jack Reese of Inter-Frater­
nity Council announced last week 
that the dance will be informal 
and tickets will be priced as low 
as possible, probably less than a 
dollar.
The competition promises to be 
keen among both the men and 
women, but all eyes will be on the 
boys from Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 
trying to repeat their victories of 
the past two years and gain per­
manent possession of the men’s 
trophy. The Delts, last year’s run­
ners-up, and all the other men’s 
groups will be out to unseat the 
champs.
Kappa Kappa Gamma walked off 
with the women’s trophy last year, 
and they will be aiming toward 
making it two in a row. The rest 
of the girls are just itching to 
disprove their supremacy.
EKN Holds Initiation; 
Scarab Presents Medal
On Fraternity Row
The TX’s played host to the Phi 
Kaps and the ATO’s last Friday at 
a stag party. On Saturday Theta 
Xi held an enjoyable “Come As 
You Are” party. But why did the 
house have to be as it was when 
it was invited?
There was a great rejoicing at 
the Delt house on Saturday night, 
brought about by a “Thank God, 
Good Beer” party. Horace Island 
Hughes was there with the Merry 
Widow. Other outstanding couples 
were Mr. and Mrs. Fields, Abe 
Hopper and a Powers Model and 
Davy Culp, who didn’t see his wife 
much.
The PiKA’s celebrated the 25th 
anniversary of their founding on 
campus with a Spring Dance at 
the house. The house was decorat­
ed ip a pastoral motif, complete 
with pans and centaurs. Dr. and 
Mrs. Davies, and Professor Ellis 
were honored guests.
The Beta’s Mothers’ club had a 
party for the group on Saturday; 
Ed Head won a door prize of a 
dozen lovely roses. As winners of 
the campus basketball champion­
ship, the Beta team has decided 
to take individual plaques instead 
of a cup, in recognition of its 
achievement.
Kappa Sigma threw open the 
doors of 624 Clyde Street last Sun­
day to play host to their parents. 
What a wonderful gesture! New 
pledge duty at the house—armed
with shovel and old newspaper, to 
keep an eye on Kappy, two- 
month-pup and new frat mascot.
The ATO’s gave a tea dance, 
last Thursday for the DG’s. On 
March 28-29 they held a conclave, 
attended by alumni from every 
chapter in the district. It includ­
ed a banquet at the University 
Club, formal initiation, and a 
dance at the house.
At the Stag Party at the SAE 
house last Friday night, A1 Erick­
son went through a rendition of 
Julius Maccabeus which surpris­
ed the visiting Pitt SAE’s no 
end. Logan Dickerson wasn’t pre­
pared for such a warm reception 
from Ruth Critchlow on their date 
at the Chartiers Country Club. 
Seems she was pinned to a frat 
brother.
The DU’s had the most terrific 
dance of the season Saturday 
night at the Chartiers Country 
Club. Lang Thompson’s orchestra 
provided the music. They are 
looking forward to an even bigger 
time when the SAE’s entertain 
them for winning the basketball 
game. Bill Bourke has lost his pin 
to Betty Haggerty.
The hungry Phi Kaps form a 
part of the Skibo lunch line be­
cause Mrs. Williams, the house 
cook is recuperating from an op­
eration. Young deMoraes claims 
he “lost” his frat pin. A Brazilian

Suddenly it’s spring — sudden­
ly there are only two weeks left 
until the opening of Rock’n Riot, 
the new S&S musical.
Bill Liff, one time Scotch and 
Soda celebrate, came to visit his 
old haunts here last week. He is 
at present stage manager of Call 
Me Mister, the musical comedy 
which played at the Nixon last 
week. Biff left town regretting 
only that he could not be on hand 
for the opening night of Rock 'n’ 
Riot.
Danny Franks, Dave Crantz, 
and various other members of the 
show had their hands full last 
week when tickets for the show 
went on sale. The boys were all 
but swamped during the rush 
hours in the Beanery. Peggy Will, 
president of the Delta Delta Delta 
sorority, has been helping with 
the ticket sale and deserves a 
great deal of credit for her ef­
forts. Hler splendid actions are all 
the more marveled at when it is 
realized that she has Les Stanford 
to cope with during off-hours.
The personnel of the costume 
department of the show are work­
ing full time now. Armed with 
tape measures, Marjorie Aronson 
and Mary Cuteri have been chas­
ing members of the cast from one 
end of the Art school to the other 
in search of pertinent data. Chuck

TUESDAY, AURIL 15, 1947THE CARNEGIE NEUTRON
Tech Sports Scope
By Pete Cregut
Behind the scenes of the current drive for funds for the Steffen 
fund, there seems to be a very clever job of sabotage going on. It is 
worthy of your attention if for no other reason than it serves to il­
lustrate the problems that we are all faced with, and must overcome, 
if we are to have the football team that we all want.
As reported in this column,posit the money because the con­
tributions would then not be vol­
untary. '
A letter was then dispatched to 
Dr. Doherty protesting this treat­
ment and asking for some assist­
ance in overcoming such obstacles. 
As yet no answer has been re­
ceived.
It is evident from all this that 
something more than worrying 
about how the poor students are 
going to throw our money around 
is behind this. A football team is 
just not wanted by the adminis­
tration of this school, and any at­
tempt to have one will be tolerat­
ed only as long as the attempt 
does not in any way jeopardize 
not having one.
The question, then, is: Who is 
the driving force behind this op­
position? The members of the ad­
ministration who have stymied 
the attempts so far are as adept 
at the art of passing the buck as 
any Commanding Officer. Dean 
Dickinson has intimated that Dr. 
Doherty feels that the Steffen 
fund is strictly an alumni affair 
and the students should not have 
anything to do with it. Our 
worthy president has left the im­
pression that the Board of 
Trustees have left his hands tied. 
And therefore the blame should 
fall completely on them.
Our opinion is that the blame 
can be pushed no further along 
than Dr. Doherty. He has come to 
the conclusion that a football team 
has no place in a school of this 
type and therefore is going to do
prior to the start of the campaign 
for funds, the members of the ad­
ministration went on record as be­
ing wholly behind the drive. In 
view of the things that have 
transpired since, this appears to be 
a two-faced statement worthy of 
only the best politicians.
That something was fishy first 
came to light when the Dorm 
Council, having voted to donate 
$200 to the Steffen fund from 
their bulging treasury, attempted 
to get the check signed by Dean 
Dickinson. His answer was that 
he could not do it because it was 
not a voluntary contribution.
Neglecting the fact entirely that 
the members of that council were 
the elected representatives of the 
fellows living in the dorms, the 
holders of the unusable check of­
fered to make up a petition to the 
effect that the undersigned were 
willing to contribute to the Steffen 
fund, and then ask the fellows 
living in the dorm to sign it. It 
certainly required a good deal of 
imagination to catch a hint of co­
ercion in that idea.
But Dean Dickinson had the re­
quired amount and put thumbs 
down on that also. Rapidly coming 
to the end of their rope, the fel­
lows then suggested a refund of 
50c from the treasury to be dis- 
tribütéd to each man and allow 
the man to contribute it or not, 
as he saw fit. The Dean thought 
that was a fine idea except that 
it wrould be impossible to have 
receptacles nearby in which to de-

anything he can to force everyone 
else to be consistent with his 
views. The Board of Trustees ap­
pear to be content with going 
along with him in this respect and 
Dean Dickinson is just a mouth­
piece with uncompromising al­
legiance to his employer.
This whole thing brings out one 
important fact: If we are going 
to do anything about having a 
winning ball club, we are going to 
have to do it ourselves with no 
help from the administration. It 
can be done by keeping up our 
contributions until we have stir­
red up enough noise to get the 
wandering alumni reinterested. 
Once that is done we will have 
won our fight and be able to go 
out on a Saturday afternoon and 
have something to cheer about.

ever to receive this award, was
a member of the drama school, the

keep his opponents from making 
any gain through his tackle posi­

Basketball
The results of the basketball 
playoff last month showed the 
Betas on top followed by the 
T. X’s and the S. A. E.’s in that 
order. The Betas nosed out the 
T. X.’s 30-28 in a very sluggish 
game after the T. X.’s slipped one 
by the S. A. E.’s 31-30. The Beta* 
clinched the playoff by winning 
easily in the final game with the 
S. A. E.’s 42-27.
The Betas weren’t as lucky with 
the Phys. Ed’s of Pitt, however, 
when they fought it out for the 
city championship. The Pitt team 
got off to a fast start in the first 
quarter, and although the Betas 
were always trying to close the 
gap they managed to stay out in 
fropt in every period to win 39- 
34.
The best basketball game of th 
year was played just before tt 
Easter vacation, when the D. U 
challenged the S. A. E.’s for 
keg of beer. With four minutes

[Continued from page 3] 
that each and every committee 
member would have several im­
portant questions to be answered. 
Such was not the case. It would 
seem then, that either the com­
plaints had no basis in fact or 
that those in the best position to 
present gripes and ideas are afraid 
to do so. Probably this reluctance 
to speak was due in part to each 
factor.
Perhaps the setting was too 
formal, or it may have been that 
the thirteen were over-awed by 
the man at the head of the table. 
But the strongest impression we 
took away was that each of the 
members could have given the 
meeting more thought before­
hand. This should have included 
seeking from the members of 
their own organizations sugges­
tions for topics to seek informa­
tion about and problems to pre­
sent. For isn’t it true that the in­
dividual student should realize 
that his most direct road to the 
President’s desk is through his 
representative on the Student 
Conference committee?
Our second major criticism of 
the committee is that for some 
reason publicity about it is prac­
tically non-existent. Since it is 
primarily a body with the pur­
pose of presenting and diseminat- 
ing information, publicity should 
be one of its premiere interests. 
Too many Skibo-ites don’t know
that such a thing as the Student 
Conference committee exists. We 
feel that this responsibility rests 
largely with the Tartan, but then 
the tongue also has long been 
known as a rather useful carrier 
of information.
The strength of this committee 
should lie in the opinions of the 
students represented by the mem­
bers. These representatives should 
act primarily as couriers for their 
particular organizations, for theirs 
cannot and should not be the en­
tire responsibility for originating 
all ideas and plans in the school. 
Nevertheless, they certainly are 
in the best position to present the 
assorted gripes and problems of 
all the students. For us the feel­
ing was inescapable that, for the 
most part, this was not a meeting 
of organizations, as it should have 
been, but of individuals who did 
not feel the full weight of their 
brethren behind them.
Students OK 
Council Change
The proposed amendment to the 
Student Council constitution was 
passed by a vote of 349 to 9 at the 
last general assembly. Although 
the actual number of voters was. 
small, the overwhelming majority 
in favor of the amendment seems 
to indicate that the students ap­
prove the change.
According to the new method 
of elections, members of Student 
Council will be elected twice dur­
ing the school year, one-half of 
the members being chosen at each 
general election. Because of the 
large number of members leaving 
at the end of this term, a great 
number of new representatives 
must be elected this month.

Steve Marcinizyn Receives 
Student Achievement Award
A high spot of the Engineer’s 
Banquet held at the Fort Pitt Ho­
tel on Saturday, April 12, was the 
presentation of the Evening Stu­
dent Achievement Award to Ste­
phen Marcinizyn.
A committee composed of mem­
bers of the faculty and adminis­
tration was formed to study the 
records of seventeen evening stu­
dents who are candidates for the 
degree of Bachelor of Science at 
the next commencement. The re­
sult of their study was a unani­
mous vote for Steve. It was the 
opinion of the committee that he 
more than fulfills all the require­
ments upon which the award is 
based; and in view of his services 
to the Evening Student Council 
especially during the war years. 
Steve is an ideal, choice for the 
award for his unfailing interest 
in extra-curricular activities and 
his high scholastic record.
This being the first year that 
the award was given we should 
explain what the award is and 
how the candidates are chosen.
The purpose of the award is to 
stimulate outstanding scholarship, 
personal achievement, participa­
tion in extra-curricular activities. 
Each year candidates for the 
Bachelor’s Degree in Evening 
school will be considered for this
New Play Ready
Coronado’s Children will be the

John Witcher Young, a graduate 
student of the Arts Department, 
is the author of the production, 
which will open April 15 and run 
through April 22. Casts for the 
play will soon be posted, and 
tickets are now available in Mr. 
McKelway’s office, IH 132A.
award. Their scholastic records 
as well as their personal charac­
teristics and outside work will 
be studied.
The recipient of the award is 
chosen by the Evening Student 
Council from recommendations by 
a committee selected for that pur­
pose.
The award consists of the fol­
lowing:
1. The student’s name to be 
engraved on a plaque that will be 
displayed in a prominent and 
suitable place in one of the cam­
pus buildings and to which other 
names will be added each year.
2. A key, engraved with the 
recipient’s name.
3. A certificate stating the basis 
of the award.
The members of the committee 
for this year’s award were: Di­
rectors Cleeton, Jones and War­
den; Asst. Directors Work and 
Miner; Professors Stanton, Estep 
and Muhlenbruch; and Evening 
Registrar McKelway.

This discussion should provide 
many interesting facts for all stu­
dents, faculty, and administration 
members interested in the solu­
tion of the football problem. In­
asmuch as this program has been 
prepared prior to the present foot­
ball scholarship campaign now un­
derway, the points presented do 
not necessarily represent the 
views of the student body or the 
administration.
Clem is free of the law again 
and back behind the chatter again, 
and the wheel of excitement is 
turning very rapidly right at the 
present time. In fact, I haven’t 
had time for a shave in the past 
two days, and anyway shaving is 
just a waste of time—it says here! 
And another thing, this Engineer­
ing Banquet has got me into a 
tailspin. Oh, unhappy day! But I 
do hope everyone has a wonderful 
time. From the latest rumors, 
there will be quite a few samples 
given away at the dinner and I’m 
wondering if there are to be any 
samples from the local bank.
Paul finally has his typewriter— 
got it from Professor Neelley (of 
Neelley & Tracey Calculus fame). 
“Good deal,” says P. M., “has 
everything on it — Greek letters, 
math symbols, everything, only 
trouble is that it has gumbands 
instead of springs.”
Just hearsay — Imagine this: 
there were a selected few who 
thought they should be allowed 
to take their wives to the Engi­
neering Banquet . . . Girls were 
all peeved about the wind storm 
which deprived them of wearing 
their big Easter bonnets . . . A1

Patience, Men! Don’t let the

Walt Keitzer “hit the numbers” 
on a recent Physics experiment. 
His result was a combination of 
the accepted value and he drew 
a “hit on the box” and also a red 
check from the instructor.

PGPi To Meet 
Sunday, April 30
Phi Gamma Pi, the only organ­
ization for the women in evening 
school, will have their regular 
monthly business meeting Sunday, 
April 30, at 3:00 in the Carnegie 
Union.
The agenda for this meeting in­
cludes a discussion of the con­
stitution in the process of being 
written, selection of a pin for the 
group and the banquet scheduled 
late in May for the group’s mem­
bers.
It is important that all members 
attend this meeting because it will 
be the last meeting at which plans 
for the banquet will be discussed. 
Plans have been made to hold the 
banquet in Webster Hall, but as 
yet no definite menu has been de­
cided. This dinner will be the 
first social event sponsored by the 
group. /
Marjorie Bomer is chairman of 
the refreshment committee for the 
April meeting.
