Black students protest insensitivity
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Features Editor
Demanding more education 
and awareness of insensitivity 
towards ethnic groups on cam­
pus, 37 black students walked 
into the office of Associate Dean 
of Student Affairs Lois Cox on 
October 6 carrying signs reading 
“Educate” and “Don’t Perpetuate 
the Myth.”
Headed by Spirit President 
Nicole Austin, the students filled 
Cox’s Warner Hall office at 3:30 
and stayed for almost an hour. 
Dean of Student Affairs Brad 
Walter, Student Ombudsman 
Mike Murphy, and Legal Advi­
sor Ron Campana were also pres­
ent by the end of the hour.
The 37 students outlined sev­
eral examples of what they 
termed “insensitivity caused by 
ignorance,” among which was the 
recent release of a calendar by 
Student Affairs entitled “31 
Things To Do with a Great Tan.”
The calendar contained a Sambo 
caricature, an image which blacks 
claim is racist.
“Our purpose is to influence 
and address,” Spirit Executive 
Vice President Mike Bowman 
told the administrators. The 
students called for a meeting a 
week later with administration 
and academic representatives to 
address the issues of insensitiv­
ity, racism, and ignorance, and 
for the creation of a minority 
advisory position within Student 
Affairs.
“We all need to be better edu­
cated,” Austin told The Tartan. 
“I want people on this campus to 
know we’re not just doing this for 
ourselves, we’re doing it for eve­
rybody. Everybody deserves to 
know — needs to know — about 
the positive contributions of eth­
nic people.” Austin is a senior 
Applied History major.
According to Austin, black 
students have wanted to act 
against ignorance on campus for

Amid charges of homophobia and big­
otry, Student Government President Andy 
Robitshek vetoed a Student Senate reso­
lution supporting the Pittsburgh City 
Council gay-rights legislation.
“I am vetoing this resolution because of 
the way it was discussed at Senate. The 
problem was no one knew exactly what 
this ordinance stated. Though some Sena­
tors tried to explain what they thought it 
said, there was never a copy of the ordi­
nance provided to the Senators. It would

until the the time was right. “The 
Sambo thing just served basi­
cally as a catalyst,” she said.
“It’s a beginning. Now we have 
to go through the meetings and 
see how much we can accom­
plish,” said freshman architect 
Yaalieth Simpson. “It’s a matter 
of seeing things happen.”
Last Thursday, one week after 
the meeting in Cox’s office, over 
75 administrators, faculty, and 
students gathered in Doherty 
Hall 2210 to identify specific 
ethnic problems on campus and 
to discuss plans to rectify them.
Opening the meeting, Austin 
thanked all who attended and 
read a letter from Senior Applied 
History/Professional Writing 
Major Melissa Merriland Hous­
ton. The letter accompanied a 
petition signed by over 160 stu­
dents in support of “the addition 
of classes and texts to the rele­

Two computer viruses, Scores and nVIR, 
have caused system errors to occur when 
infected programs are run on certain 
Macintoshes in Carnegie Mellon clusters.
A computer virus is a piece of software 
designed to move secretly from disk to 
disk. Some viruses are harmless and exist 
on disks undetected. However most vi­
ruses are designed to do damage of some 
sort.
Viruses can also cause other sorts of 
problems. Many IBM PC viruses erase 
data from disks. A virus can do virtually 
anything that its creator tells it to do.
Viruses spread between applications and 
systems on disks. A virus is implanted 
into a system or application by its creator. 
When the virus finds an uninfected appli­
cation or system on another disk (or the 
same disk) it copies itself into it. In this 
manner, the virus spreads throughout an 
individual’s software and then to other 
people’s disks as they are shared.
Viruses can also be spread indirectly 
from disk to disk through modems and 
networks.
As with a human virus, the spread of a 
computer virus is dependant on the in­
fected body coming into contact with an 
uninfected one, and then moving on to the 
new partner. A computer virus can be
spread for a long time before symptoms 
occur. Many computer viruses have a built 
in time delay between the time they infect 
a disk and the time they begin causing 
problems. Scores is such a virus. Accord­
ing to an article published in the Novem­
ber 1988 issue of Macworld, Scores lies 
dormant for four days before it begins 
crashing programs and does not reach its 
full effectiveness until seven days after 
infection.
Hard disks present an especially good 
opportunity for viruses to create havoc 
because they put a large number of poten­
tial target applications in the same place. 
Once a virus has entered the hard disk it

NeXT unveils “university on a desktop”
By BRUCE KASREL
Special to The Tartan
SAN FRANCISCO 
— Ending three years 
of speculation and ru­
mors, Apple Com­
puter Co-Founder 
Steve Jobs finally un­
veiled his latest com­
puter creation here in 
San Francisco on 
Wednesday. Jobs dis­
played the first prod­
uct from his new com­
pany, NeXT, to over 
3000 members of the 
computer industry and press. Judging from 
the frequent applause and a standing 
ovation at the end of the three-hour pres­
entation, they liked what they saw.
Jobs began the “show” by explaining 
how the machine came to exist. Reading 
from an ad placed inThe Wall Street Jour­
nal, “We [NeXT] collaborated with the 
leaders of educational computing... we 
asked them not for their list of specifica­
tions, but for a list of their dreams. Nor to 
extend what computers have been, but to
imagine what they could be. Only then did
NeXT’s sleek new computer system. Shown from left to right, 
Printer, high resolution Megapixel Display, and the Computer, 
(foreground) mouse and keyboard.
we begin to develop the NeXT computer.” 
Carnegie Mellon’s Director of Computing, 
William Arms, was one of the twenty-five 
NeXT advisors.
The new machine, which will be sold 
only to colleges and universities, is the 
first offering from Jobs since he brought 
forth the Apple Macintosh in 1984. When 
asked how someone outside academia 
could get a NeXT machine, Jobs replied 
“enroll.”
While the black exterior of the NeXT 
machine is in sharp contrast to the beige
Mac, many industry 
experts believe that 
this machine will 
have an equally revo­
lutionary effect on the 
computer industry.
The $6500 ma­
chine, dubbed a “uni­
versity on a desktop” 
by Jobs, is housed in 
a sleek black-magne- 
sium casing. From an 
engineering stand­
point, black-magne- 
sium is a good mate­
rial; it can dissipate 
heat well and can 
protect the circuits from electromagnetic 
radiation. From an aesthetic standpoint, 
it looks “cool” as Jobs described it.
The main guts of the computer are pow­
ered by two of the fastest computer chips 
on the market: the Motorola 68030 micro­
processor, and the 68882 Floating Point 
Unit. Also on the main system board are 
two proprietary VLSI (Very Large Scale 
Integration) chips developed by NeXT. 
These two chips handle the complex infor­
mation interchange between the computer

IFC to be disbanded
RANDY UDAVCAK
Tartan Staffwriter
The Council of Fraternity Presi­
dents (CFP) approved a proposal for 
a reorganization of the Greek sys­
tem, in a meeting which took place 
last Wednesday. This proposal 
comes in the wake of the sororities’ 
withdrawal from the IFC two weeks 
ago over some of the same concerns.
Under the system outlined in the 
proposal, the IFC, in its present 
form, will cease to exist, being re­
placed by a “Greek council.”
Ron Campana, Director of Greek 
Affairs, said that this new organiza­
tion will have “no judicial jurisdic­
tion over either group,” but will 
instead serve solely as an informa­
tional body, with the fraternities 
and sororities being independent 
from one another.
Andy Philips, president of Theta 
Xi, stated, “I think it is a very im­
portant issue that the fraternities 
and sororities do get along and work 
with each other. I only see it as a 
good thing.”
The proposal states that the new 
Greek Council “....would be a non- 
authoritative committee. It would 
simply be a committee to keep com­
munications between the fraterni­
ties and sororities open. The com­
mittees second main purpose would 
be to coordinate activities that are 
shared by the entire Greek commu­
nity (i.e. Greek Sing/Swing, Water- 
mellon Bash, and Spring Picnic).” 
Campana said, “I am in full support 
of the changes...I think that it will 
be good for the whole system.” 
Mike Frank, presidentof the CFP, 
said thatit ishis perception that the 
organization should “merely coordi-

The long awaited campus computer network has finally been 
completed. The network provides access to virtually all of the 
university computing facilities including Andrew, Bulletin 
Boards, and printing facilities.
Students who wish to hook their personal computers into the 
network need to buy a kit from the computer store. The price is 
$50 for a Macintosh and $450 for an IBM PC. Students do not 
have to pay the usual activation fee. Most of the dormitories are 
hooked up. Other dormitories will be connected upon requests 
from students. One student request in a dormitory is sufficient 
•to have the network activated. The hookup usually takes about 
three to five working days after the request is made.

On October 22, during Homecoming, the Department of Civil 
Engineering will dedicate one of its new laboratories in honor of 
Professor Tung Au. This is the first time that a university 
facility has been named in honor of a sitting faculty member. 
Prof. Au has been a member of the Civil Engineering faculty for 
32 years.
The new lab will be dedicated as the Tung Au Educational 
Laboratory. It is part of the Civil Engineering Laboratories that 
will be devoted primarily to undergraduate education. “More 
than any other faculty I know,” says Dr. Paul Christiano, head 
of the department, “Professor Au has earned the respect and 
affection of his students. He is what all of us faculty would like 
to be or become.”
Yao becomes ASME Fellow
Professor Shichune Yao of Mechanical Engineeringhas been 
named a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engi­
neers (ASME). The ASME Fellow grade is conferred upon a 
member with at least 10 years active engineering practice and 
who have made contributions to the field of mechanical Engi­
neering.

The Consortium for Computing in Undergraduate Education 
held a conference at Carnegie Mellon on Sat. Oct. 8. The Consor­
tium focused on integrating computing into undergraduate edu­
cation. It featured speakers David Smallen, Director of Informa­
tion at Hamilton College, Bill Graves, IBM Consulting Scholar 
at the University of North Carolina, and Nancy Kapalan, Senior 
Lecturer at Cornell University.

creation of an ethnic studies 
section in the library.”
“The reason why we’re here is 
insensitivity, insensitivity by 
students and administration,” 
Bowman said. He mentioned 
specific examples, including 
statements made on WRCT and 
words painted on the Fence.
Bowman claimed ATO’s buggy 
Rebel Yell was insensitive to­
wards blacks because of its Civil 
War theme. According to ATO 
President Jim Camp, Rebel Yell 
is so named because ATO broth­
ers drank Rebel Yell whisky when 
constructing the buggy.
Black students present at the 
October 13 meeting were also 
upset that during last year’s 
Sweepstakes, ATO brothers wore 
Confederate headbands on their 
heads. Camp claimed the head­
bands were worn only to match 
the buggy’s theme, but black 
students claimed offense.
“There were absolutely no in­
tentions of giving off a prejudiced 
impression. We’re not prejudiced. 
We have black pledges,” Camp 
said in an interview. “There’s 
going to have to be some type of 
communication. I’m willingto dis­
cuss it with them.”
According to Austin, Camp’s 
attitude is representative of the 
problem the black students are 
trying to address. “Nobody’s say­
ing that they were intentionally 
being racist,” she said Saturday. 
“It’s obvious they were unedu-' 
cated.”
The move of the Carnegie 
Mellon Action Project from Mar­
garet Morrison 410 to Bureau of 
Mines B was also addressed at 
the October 13 meeting. CMAP 
is a university program designed 
to aid in the recruitment and re­
tention of minority students; it is 
temporarily housed in 5125
“If Carnegie Mellon is the profes­
sional choice, well, then our profes­
sionals need to know how to deal 
with a variety of people. ”
—Spirit President Nicole Austin
Margaret Morrison Street, the 
previous location of Tech House. 
Current plans call for CMAP to 
move to its new location over 
winter break.
According to Bowman, “CMAP 
is very important in helping 
blacks get through CMU.” He 
and other black students assert 
that the move of CMAP away 
from the center of campus will 
cause an increase in the black 
dropout rate. “Attendance atTech 
House has dropped 15-20%,” 
Bowman claimed.
“We’re concerned about CMAP 
being in that location, off-cam- 
pus almost,” Senior Reginald 
Motley said. “Not a lot of stu­
dents are usingthe service [after 
its move to Tech House].”
Vice President for Business 
Affairs Fred Rogers told the as­
sembled students that when 
current construction is com­
pleted, the new location in Bu­
reau of Mines will not be as inac­
cessible. “The whole traffic flow 
isgoingto change,"Rogers stated.
“We ought not take the point 
that only CMAP be the home for 
Black CarnegieMellon students,” 
Vice President for Enrollment 
William Elliott said. “Carnegie 
Mellon should be a home for 
them.” He asked students to help 
“get on with the agenda” in the 
hopes thatby addressing the real 
issues the new CMAP location 
could be made to work.
Changes in curricula — both 
through the addition of courses 
dealing with ethnic studies and 
through the revision of existing 
history courses-—was also called 
for by the black students. They 
presented a list of books to be 
incorporated into the courses 
Introduction to World History, 
Development of American Soci­
ety, and Western Civilization, 
and asked that the course Social 
Influences, which was cancelled 
due to a lack of student interest, 
be reinstated. In addition, stu­
dents noted that the current free 
elective system in MCS and CIT 
did not allow much opportunity 
to take currently-offered courses 
dealing with ethnic history.
“Students have to be educated 
to other cultures,” Bowman said. 
“America is about melting pot, 
it’s about different cultures com­
ing together in the name of lib­
erty. The US is not supposed to 
be about violence, it’s supposed 
to be about melting pot.”
Professor Peter Steams, head 
of theHistory Department, asked 
that the focus of the curricula 
changes be broader than a single 
department. He mentioned the 
addition of bl ack literature to the 
English curriculum.
Addressing the issue of free 
electives available to science and 
engineering students, Dean 
Robert Kail told students that 
MCS/CIT free electives were
recommended on the basis 
which courses were in the H&SS 
core. “Change the H&SS core 
requirements, and MCS and CIT 
will follow,” he said.
“If Carnegie Mellon is the pr0. 
fessional choice, well, then our 
professionals need to know how 
to deal with a variety of people 
Austin claimed. Representative! 
of the black students hope to meet
with Dean Stephen Fienberg 
H&SS to discuss changes.
Also mentioned was the recruit, 
ment of black faculty. According 
to Associate Dean Richard Lu. 
thy of CIT, there are no Black 
faculty members in CIT, out of 
about 100 faculty members. Hi 
and other faculty members cited 
the “infinitesimal” numbers of 
black PhD graduates across the 
country as a reason.
“We’re trying to target black 
engineers, and bring them to 
CMITs PhD program, so thatthej 
will go out in the world,” Luthy 
said. “The intent is to get a few 
talented people in the pipeline. 
I’ve talked to my colleagues, and 
if we all do this together, the 
problem will solve itself.”
Students also presented a li: 
of ethnic publications which are 
not currently in CMU library 
holdings. They asked for the crea­
tion of an ethnic studies section 
in Hunt Library, and mentioned 
that the current issues of ethnic 
magazines should be moved to 
the reading area in the front of 
the library.
Black students realize the 
changes will not be immediate. 
“We have a long way to go,” Austin 
said Saturday. “We won’t know 
how effective all our efforts are 
until we go to the library and see 
an ethnic studies section, for 
example. We’ve done the best we 
could as far as trying to 
something started.”

Carnegie Mellon fights computer virus
continued from page 1
can spread throughout the appli­
cations, making it very difficult 
to control its spread. Hard disks 
spread the virus to other disks 
more quickly because, unlike any 
one floppy disk, the hard disk is 
used virtually every time the 
computer is turned on. This 
method of virus transmission is a 
particularly large problem in 
situations such as in clusters 
where a large number of people 
use their own floppy disks with 
public hard disks.
CMU’s Scores epidemic has 
come primarily from two local­
ized outbreaks. One was in Hunt 
Library’s cluster. The other was 
in the Wean 5419 cluster used for 
the Introduction to Computing 
classes.
The Scores virus is believed to 
have been written by a program­
mer fired by Electronic Data 
Systems (EDS) in Dallas. Accord­
ing to Macworld he put the virus 
on a floppy disk which he sneaked 
into the company’s office. It found 
its way onto EDS’s disks and has 
spread across the country.
The Scores virus is believed to 
have entered the Hunt cluster 
during a GSIA workshop late in 
the summer. It infected the hard 
disks on the new Mac IIs and was 
spread to students’ disks when 
they used the computers at the 
beginning of the semester. The 
virus was discovered and re­
moved from the hard disks but it 
had already begun to be spread 
in the campus community.
Cluster Personnel Administra­
tor Gary Aulfinger reports that 
viruses are still a problem in Hunt 
because the hard disks frequently 
pick them up from infected disks
used by students.
Aulfinger said that “As soon as 
we have a [hard or floppy] disk 
that is suspicious of having a 
virus, even if we have not checked 
it, we take it out of circulation.” 
Despite these attempts Software 
Manager Academic Computing 
Peggy Seiden says that “It is a 
constant battle to keep the disks 
free of viruses.”
The other major incident which 
helped spread the Scores virus at 
Carnegie Mellon was an infec­
tion on the hard disk used by the 
Introduction to Computing 
classes. Jim Roberts, who is the 
lecturer in 15-116 and 15-118, 
explained that the virus entered 
the hard disk when a TA un­
knowingly used a contaminated 
floppy disk in the computer.
The virus infected a Pascal 
program used in the classes and 
was present on the copies given 
to students. Roberts said that a 
virus detection program was used 
to guard against viruses but ap­
parently was not used at the 
proper time to catch this virus.
Once the problem was discov­
ered two weeks ago, Mark 
Stehlik, the Associate Director of 
the Introduction to Computing 
classes, and Research Program­
mer Beth Botos tracked down 
the virus and removed it from 
the hard disk. The students in 
the classes were told about the 
problem in lecture and the TAs 
spent the next two days showing 
them how to remove the virus 
from their disks.
Roberts said he was very im­
pressed by the way the students 
reacted to the situation. Roberts 
commented that the students 
were hurt most by the virus, say
ing “I think the biggest time loss 
was not ours, but the students’.”
CMU Police Chief James La- 
Paglia said that he is not aware 
of any Pennsylvania laws spe­
cifically aimed at preventing 
computer viruses. However, he 
said that people who write or 
spread viruses could be charged 
with more general crimes such 
as vandalism or institutional 
vandalism.
LaPaglia said that students 
caught knowingly spreading vi­
ruses could be dealt with in two 
ways, either through criminal 
prosecution or through the Stu­
dent Affairs office. The Student 
Affairs office could impose a range 
of penalties including expulsion.
Although viruses are difficult 
to guard against there are a 
number of things that people can 
do to protect their disks. One of 
the easiest forms of protecting 
floppy disks is to write-protect 
them.
Another piece of advice to pro­
tect against viruses is to be very 
careful about exchanging soft­
ware.
Important software should be 
backed up as soon as it is ac­
quired so that the original will be 
safe.
There are several ways to get 
rid of viruses. The easiest way is 
to erase the disk, or at least in­
fected applications. If the infected 
programs are backed up, a disk 
can be “rebuilt.” If clean copies of 
vital programs are not available 
there are anti-viral programs 
which can eliminate the infec­
tion.
Most of the programs are pub­
lic domain software and can be 
obtained in the Mac clusters.
Student Senate resolution vetoed

be an unfortunate precedent for 
the Senate to start making reso­
lutions or rules without having 
all the facts in front of them,” 
wrote Robitshek in his veto.
Two weeks ago, H&SS Senator 
Matt Ruben introduced a resolu­
tion which asked President Rich­
ard Cyert to write a letter to the 
Pittsburgh City Council support­
ing its gay-rights legislation. .
After a limited discussion, CIT 
Senator Karen Pavlosky tabled 
the resolution until October 11 
because the majority of Student 
jV Senators had not seen a copy of 
the City Council’s proposed leg- 
- islation.
Last week, at the Oct. 11 meet- 
. ing, CIT Senator Chuck Jainchill 
, took the resolution from the table 
’ and reintroduced it with minor 
revisions. Because the City Coun­
cil had rejected its gay-rights leg­
islation on Monday, with a 4-4
vote, Jainchill changed the reso­
lution so that it urged the Coun­
cil to reconsider its legislation.
Due to a “problem of mis-com- 
munication,” neither Jainchill 
nor Ruben had a copy of the 
Council’s ordinance for the Oct. 
11 Senate meeting, said Jainchill.
“I didn’t get a copy of the ordi­
nance because I thought it was a 
dead issue — it was a breakdown 
in communication,” said Ruben.
After a lengthy discussion that 
included accusations of homopho­
bia, Senate passed the resolution 
17-6. Two days later, Robitshek 
vetoed the resolution.
“Student Senate has to know 
what they are voting on,” said 
Robitshek. “I fully support this 
resolution, but I want it done 
right.”
Jainchill, however, felt that the 
Senate had a working knowledge 
of the ordinance.

Two Senior Fence posts to be replaced
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
A tentative plan to fix the 
fence was developed at an Oc­
tober 4 meeting attended by 
Student Ombudsman and Co­
ordinator of Special Projects 
Michael Murphy, Student 
Body President Andy Ro­
bitshek, Vice Presidentfor En­
rollment William Elliott, and 
University Architect Paul 
Tellers.
The proposal, as summa­
rized in a memo sent to Elliott 
by Tellers, suggests replacing 
the two farthest west poles 
and the rails connectingthem.
(The western end of the Fence is 
the end closest to Doherty Hall.) 
The posts and rails would be re­
placed by wooden pieces crafted 
to match the current (painted) 
dimensions of the rest of the 
Fence.
The replacement pieces would 
then be painted with two coats of 
an oil base paint designed for 
outdoor wood. Tellers also sug­
gested the installation of an elec­
trical outlet near the Fence to 
make it easier for groups holding 
the Fence to plug in appliances.
Murphy would like student 
feedback before a final decision 
is made. He invites students to 
call him at x2991 if they wish to
express an opinion on the plan. 
Students can also call Ro­
bitshek at x5495. The final 
decision will probably be made 
at a meeting next week.
The meeting is open to all 
students. The location and 
time of the meeting will be 
announced through the cam­
pus media.
One issue which still re­
mains to be resolved is the 
question of what to do with the 
pieces of the Fence which will 
be removed. Robitshek would 
like to find a way to distribute 
the pieces to students. There 
is a proposal to donate some of 
the pieces to Scotland Yard.
Proposed “Greek council” to replace IFC

nate what the fraternities want 
to do and what the sororities want 
to do, and bring the whole Greek 
system to a higher plateau.” 
Frank added further that the 
council should additionally lead 
Greek affairs “...in some kind of 
positive direction, whether it be 
philanthropy, or through P.R., or 
through sponsoring events on 
campus, developing a drug and 
alcohol program...It should be 
able to utilize facilities from both 
the sororities andfratemities and 
better the Greek system.” 
Campana also added that such 
changes in the Greek structure 
are by no means unprecedented. 
He said that when the fraterni­
ties and sororities decided to 
band together in a collaborative 
capacity, they were under the 
title of The United Fraternal Or-
ganization (UFO), which then de­
veloped into the currentt IFC.
In checking the minutes of past 
IFC meetings, Campana said he 
found that some of the same griev­
ances which caused Panhel to 
pull-out of the organization were 
brought up by the sororities as 
far back as 1981.
“Our system is unique,” said 
Campana. “I don’t know of an­
other university where the Inter 
Fraternity Council has both the 
fraternities and sororities under 
it’s auspices.”
Under this new system, many 
of the positions of the present 
IFC officers will be eliminated in 
the Greek council. The new struc­
ture would be comprised of a 
committee of seven members: the 
CFP President, the Panhel Presi­
dent, a Greek Sing/Swing Chair­
person, a Social Chairperson, a
Philanthropy /PR Chairperson, 
and one additional representa­
tive from CFP and Panhel.
A meeting is scheduled for Oct. 
19, for which Campana said he 
has asked Mike Murphy, student 
Ombudsman, to be the mediator/ 
moderator between the Panhel 
president Denise Visconti, CFP 
president Mike Frank, and IFC 
president Chris Pace. The organi­
zations have each drafted pro­
posals, and the purpose of the 
meeting will be to combine those 
drafts into a final document.
This document will then be 
brought back to both Panhel and 
CFP for approval, and if accepted 
by each, will then be forwarded 
to Dean Walter, Dean of Student 
Affairs, for final approval. “My 
impression is that this is going to 
be a very amicable reorganiza­
tion,” said Campana.
other Senators say is true... there 
has to be a certain amount of 
trust,” said Jainchill.
Even more extreme is Ruben’s 
contention that the veto came 
from fear. “The technical point is 
valid, but I have a very, very 
hard time believing that that is 
[Robitshek’s] motivation,” said 
Ruben. Instead, Ruben claims, 
Robitshek vetoed the resolution 
because of a personal bias against
Senate Chairman Erica Levy 
doesn’t agree: “His reasons for 
vetoing it were totally relevant 
— no one had a copy of it. Andy 
had every right to veto this. You 
do have to trust Senate to give 
facts, but this is important 
enough to have it in front of ev­
eryone. There is always a possi­
bility to leave [information] out.” 
Jainchill and Ruben promise 
to reintroduce the resolution 
again today.

The Tartan • Carniegie Mellon • 18 October 19885
Jobs dazzles computer industry with introduction of NeXT machine
continued from page 1
and its various output devices, 
including the optical disk drive.
The VLSI chips, which Jobs 
called “mainframes on a micro­
chip” make the NeXT machine 
run nearly as fast as most main­
frames at a fraction of their size 
and cost.
The removeable magneto-opti­
cal disk drive, the first of its kind, 
allows for storage of 256 mega­
bytes of information on one com­
pact disk, this is equivalent to 
300 to 400 complete books. The 
drive, developed by Canon, writes 
magnetically like a common 
computer hard disk drive and 
optically reads information like 
a compact disk player.
Jobs stressed the significance 
of this mass storage development 
by saying that a student or fac­
ulty member could carry around 
years of research in his back­
pack. He also pointed out that a 
price tag of approximately $50 
for a disk is about 35 times 
cheaper per megabyte than tra­
ditional magnetic hard disks.
The computer also comes with 
two slots for magnetic hard disks, 
bringing up the total storage 
capacity to 1,500 megabytes.
Included in the basic model are
8 megabytes of random access 
memory (RAM). This surprised 
many industry analysts because 
of the short supply and relatively 
high cost of RAM chips.
Jobs also announced a laser 
printer that offers almost twice 
the resolution of current laser 
printers at less than half the cost. 
The printer is priced at $2000 
and produces output at a resolu- 
tion of 400 dots per inch.
Like most Apple laser printers, 
the NeXT printer relies on the 
page description language Post­
Script for its high-quality out­
put. Apple’s printers, however, 
require an internal PostScriptin- 
terpreter. Since the NeXT com­
puter uses PostScript for its vis­
ual display, there is no need for 
the printer to house an additional 
interpreter.
The monitor is the first to use 
Adobe Systems’ display Post­
Script for its screen image. “This 
provides two benefits, “ Jobs 
pointed out at the press confer­
ence following the demonstration. 
“It allows for a true consistency 
between screen and printed 
images as well as lets the com­
puter do the processing of the 
numbers, instead of the printer.”
After a ten minute intermis­
sion, Jobs came back to the stage 
and showed off the software end 
his product.
Learning a great deal from his 
days at Apple, Jobs made sure 
that the NeXT machine will not 
suffer from the same user inter­
face development problems that 
the Macintosh does.
On the NeXT machine user 
interface development takes one 
tenth the time as on the Mac. 
This is accomplished by NeXT’s 
object oriented development en­
vironment called NeXTStep.
Jobs demonstrated NeXTStep 
by developing a rather complex 
physics program to calculate the 
effect of a molecule in a gas cylin­
der, in under five minutes.
Jobs let loose another j ab at the 
Mac by having a black hole on the 
screen, used for file deletion. 
“There are no trash cans here,” 
he joked, alluding to Apple’s 
copyright infringement suit 
against Microsoft Corporation, al­
leging that a Microsoft product 
for IBM’s latest line of computers 
has many of the elements found 
in the Mac, including file folders 
and the trash can.
Jobs feels that his user inter­
face will inspire students and 
faculty to write a tremendous
amount of software applications 
in a short period of time.
The operating system that 
drives the user interface as well 
as all the application software is 
a “souped up” version of AT&T’s 
UNIX, called Mach, which was 
developed at Carnegie Mellon.
Mach has all the advantages of 
UNIX environments — multi­
tasking and full support for 
multiple hardware platforms. 
Mach has also been optimized for 
fast interprocess communica­
tions within the computer.
This is critical in an environ­
ment where tasks are performed 
by shared resources and coop­
eration between the various ap­
plications.
“It can run UNIX software on 
our machine, but once you see 
what our machine can do you 
won’t want to run UNIX soft­
ware,” Jobs pointed out.
With the audience thinking 
that there is no way that Jobs 
could pack any more stuff into 
the NeXT goodie bag, Jobs an­
nounced alliances with software 
manufacturers who will bundle 
their software with the machine. 
Included with the computer is a 
database, a technical desktop 
publishing package, C, LISP, a
word processing package, and a 
program to perform statistical 
calculations.
These are provided to ensure 
platform standards among de­
velopers so that people can share 
information without worrying 
about if the others have the same 
software.
Jobs kept the punches coming 
by announcing the inclusion of a 
digital library of common refer­
ence works, such as Webster’s 
Ninth New Collegiate Diction­
ary, Webster’s Collegiate Thesau­
rus, The Oxford Dictionary of 
Quotations, and the Oxford Uni­
versity Press edition of William 
Shakespeare: The Complete 
Works, NeXT technical refer­
ences and other pertinent tech­
nical references.
In seconds a user could look up 
any word or phrase. Jobs had a 
little fun with this feature by 
finding the antonym for a word 
often used to describe him, “mer­
curial” (unpredictable). It turned 
out that the opposite of mercu­
rial meant slow moving and stub­
born. “I like mercurial,” Jobs 
jibed.
The final big blow of the show 
came at the end when Jobs con­
firmed the NeXT/IBM partner­
ship.
NeXT has agreed to license its • 
NeXTStep interface to IBM so’ 
that there will be a universal' 
platform for all workstations.' 
This came as quite a shock to the1 
industry since Jobs openly criti­
cized IBM’s philosophy during 
his days at Apple.
“The world has got two compa­
nies working like crazy to make 
the best NeXTStep platforms, 
and everybody wins when that 
happens,” explained Jobs.
This attitude also demon­
strates that NeXT is confident 
that they can be a success in only 
the higher education market by 
giving IBM the technology to 
attack the business arena. This 
also leaves the future of Andrew 
up in the air.
While some NeXT employees 
speculated that some features of 
Andrew could be incorporated 
into the final version of 
NeXTStep, it is unlikely that 
Andrew will become the widely 
accepted educational computer 
interface as was once hoped.
For now schools like Carnegie 
Mellon will have to wait for the 
NeXT machine to arrive on cam­
pus sometime at the end of the 
year.
H&SS core curriculum discussed
By JUDY HARABURDA
Tartan Magazine Editor
The college of Humanities & 
Social Sciences (H&SS) con­
ducted a “Core Curriculum 
Symposium” on Monday, Oct. 10, 
with the dual purposes of focus­
ing on current developments and 
inviting discussion of issues con­
cerning the core curriculum.
The discussion focused on as­
pects of the H&SS Macintosh II 
computing initiative. In the fall 
of1989, the college recommended 
that incoming H&SS freshmen 
buy Mac workstations, which will 
be interfaced with the Andrew 
network. As a result of a deal 
with Apple Computer, H&SS 
faculty acquired 60 Mac IIs for 
educational development and an 
additional 25 Mac IIs will be 
installed in public clusters for 
students.
H&SS Dean Stephen Fienberg 
emphasized the focus of the inti- 
tative as “computers supporting 
education” as opposed to “educa­
tion supporting computers.” In 
response to concern by students 
and facutly members that the 
curriculum will be molded to fit 
the technology, H&SS Associate 
Dean Joseph Devine assured that 
“computers supporting educa­
tion” will serve as the guiding 
principle.
H&SS faculty from each de­
partment made presentations 
demonstrating how computers 
will be integrated into core 
courses and explained what proj­
ects were currently underway. 
Projects ranged from a note-tak- 
ing program from the English de- 
partment to the History 
department’s award-winning 
Great American History Ma­
chine, which allows students to 
: conceptualize demographic pat­
terns and trends.
In his presentation, professor 
John Hayes of the Psychology 
Department voiced concern with 
the far-reaching, total effect of 
technology on students.
In addition, an advisory group 
representing disciplines will be 
organized to evaluate the appli­
cations developed. For students, 
Computing Skills Workshop will 
shift emphasis to ensure that 
students acquire the necessary 
skills.
Other issues discussed in­
cluded financing for students, the 
Possibility of leasing with the 
option to buy, and the increasing 
; Price of the computers.
Devine emphasized that the 
j symposium was “not the last 
word” on the computer initiative 
.and future symposiums and 
departmental Student Advisory 
Councils (SACs) will allow for 
student input

Sounds of the ’60s
Anti-abortion argument flawed in its language
We are treated insensitively, They 
said.
We are victims of racism, They 
said.
We are in pain; hear our suffering! 
They shouted.
We want to increase sensitivity, 
They said.
We want to be treatedjust like You 
and You and You....
Sounds of the ’60s. Sounds heard a 
long time ago, in places far away 
from us.
Wrong.
Unbelievably, these sounds came 
from a group of black students in 
Doherty Hall last week. And from a 
group of black students in Warner 
Hall a week before that.
When 37 black students crammed 
themselves into Associate Dean of 
Student Affairs Lois Cox’s office two 
weeks ago, they demanded changes 
in the curriculum, new books for the 
library, and a black Student Affairs 
counselor. They charged the admini­
stration, the faculty, and the stu­
dents with being racist, with treat­
ing them like second-class citizens.
To prove their point, they cited an 
on-going string of minor, racially- 
induced incidents that have finally 
become unbearable to them. A Stu­
dent Affairs poster, “31 Fun Things 
to do with a Great Tan,” which fea­
tured a “Sambo” caricature, pushed 
them over the edge. Enough is 
enough.
Led by Spirit President Nicole 
Austin and Spirit Executive Vice 
President Mike Bowman, the stu­
dents are extremely organized, 
almost militant. They know what 
they want and they don’t mind skip­
ping the established lines of commu­
nication to get it.
However, now that the ball is roll­
ing, it’s time to consider whether 
these students are asking for equal 
rights or special rights. While we 
adamantly support the former, we 
cannot support the latter. There has 
to be give and take on both sides.
For example, the student pro­
testors assert that moving CMAP 
from Margaret Morrison, at the
Practice safe
It would be safe to say that “safe” 
has become the catch word for an 
insecure time. We pursue safe in­
vestments, buy safer cars, shower 
with Safeguard and have safe sex. 
Now we are faced with another “safe”
— safe computing.
The recent outbreak of Macintosh 
computer viruses on campus (see 
News) draws easily on the paradigm 
of the AIDS generation. There is 
almost an instant feeling of para­
noia when our trust in our machines 
is betrayed, as it was when our trust 
in sex was betrayed. What happened
center of campus, to the Bureau of 
Mines is the administration’s at­
tempt to push black students off 
campus. In addition to making the 
program less accessible, they argued, 
the move will make CMAP less vis­
ible, which makes it harder to edu­
cate outsiders about the program.
While the new location might not 
be as convenient, the entire campus 
is working around the present reno­
vation and construction. Everyone, 
regardless of skin color, has been 
inconvenienced in some way or 
another. Moreover, when Skibo is 
finally torn down, all student serv­
ices are scheduled to move to the 
Bureau of Mines.
On the other hand, we can all 
benefit from more education. Not 
only in terms of black history, but 
also education about the present 
situation. The black campus com­
munity is segregated from the rest 
of campus; it has its own clubs and 
administrative support. Unfortu­
nately, that means that the major­
ity of campus doesn’t know what 
goes on in the black community.
Additionally, because racism is 
more than a “black” issue, the rest of 
the minorities on campus need to 
start speaking for themselves. Just 
as blacks claim whites can never 
know their, suffering, what qualifies 
blacks to speak for all minorities?
Though there are no easy solu­
tions for racism, the fight has to 
start with the ammunition that is 
available now. We need to take 
advantage of existing minority and 
student support organizations. To 
start, let’s get Student Senate, the 
Minority Student Advisory Council, 
and the plethora of minority student 
organizations involved.
Right now, a few black students 
are making a lot of noise and getting 
a lot of attention. But regardless of 
the short-term changes they effect, 
there will be no long-term solutions 
without campus-wide support.
“America is about melting pot,” 
said Bowman. Maybe it’s time ev­
eryone, whites and blacks, started 
believing thate
computing
to the promiscuous lover is now hap­
pening to the “one night stand” Mac 
user who once upon a time traded 
programs and disks as if they were 
penny candy.
The days of “free software” are 
gone, for now anything you pick up 
from a cluster or a friend could prove 
“deadly.” As with everything else, 
safe computing is mostly common 
sense: be careful, be prudent, and let 
a little paranoia into your life. Keep 
your vaccination disks on the shelf 
next to the condoms — nowadays, it 
pays to be “safe.”
Editor:
In “Fetal Dilemma,” Jeff Fartro sets 
himself up for criticism perhaps even 
more on the basis of his use of language 
than on his “argument” for illegalizing 
abortion. In his first paragraph, Fartro 
says that “Like many liberals, [Michael 
Dukakis] is a master at masking real 
issues behind the veneer of ‘freedom,’ 
‘fairness,’ and ‘individual rights’ ” (ital­
ics mine). Whether he intends it or not, 
Fartro has just called freedom, fairness, 
and individual rights a veneer, meaning 
thin, false (“surface appearance or show,” 
say Thorndike Barnhart). These ideas 
are not, in Fartro’s term, “real issues,” 
since they are merely the mask behind 
which liberals hide them. Aren’t free­
dom, fairness and individual rights 
exactly what the philosophy of this 
country is supposed to based upon (not 
masked behind), and what Michael 
Dukakis would agree are precisely at 
stake in the abortion law question?
I am fascinated at the linguistic rever­
sal that Fartro — like many conserva-
Voters want 
to hear issues
Editor:
Having read Chuck Jainchill’s article, 
“Experienced Leadership for America,” 
we have a request for The Tartan. We 
are sure that many independent voters 
like ourselves would appreciate an 
unbiased account of the presidential 
candidates’ records. Mr. Jainchill’s ar­
ticle did not help us in our voting deci­
sion since it obviously came from a 
Dukakis supporter. Perhaps the Col­
lege Democrats and the College Repub­
licans would each be willing to submit 
information about their candidate’s 
accomplishments and views without all 
of the slurs which seem to be pervading 
this year’s election. Just a simple state­
ment of each candidate's platform — 
minus the useless jabs at the other party
— would make this important decision 
much easier.

KGB didn’t paint 
trees, say 
group’s officials
Editor:
It is a long standing tradition here to 
paint the fence. However, it is not a 
tradition to paint the trees next to the 
fence. Recently, KGB held the fence, 
and, as a friendly gesture, handed it 
over to Hoopla so they could advertise 
their dance.
KGB would like to state, for the rec­
ord, that we had nothing to do with the 
painting of the trees, and, had we known 
Hoopla’s intentions, would never have 
given them the fence. While we firmly 
believe in fun and silliness, painting the 
trees is seriously uncool, and we hope it 
never happens again.

tives — is employing here. Consider 
George Bush’s use of the American Ciyil 
Liberties Union issue to accuse Michael 
Dukakis of being “out of the mainstream” 
of American thought. Does Mr. Bush 
realize that the ACLU exists to help 
everyone in this country to exercise his 
or her right to civil liberties, including 
freedom of speech? If those ideas are 
“out of the mainstream” of American 
thought, and if freedom, fairness and 
individual rights are thin and false and 
don’t qualify as “real issues,” then I’m 
scared for all of us, but most of all for 
people like Fartro, who skip so blithely 
through such sinister language.
In his second paragraph, Fartro treats 
us to another winning phrase “In order 
to make a decision about abortion, you 
must look behind this mask [of freedom, 
fairness, and individual rights] and into 
the womb” (italics mine). Fartro here 
neatly confirms a feminist observation 
about men interested in eliminating 
women’s choice about abortion: that they 
are motivated by a desire to invade the 
female body. His use of the grandiose 
“the womb,” implying that there’s some 
sort of Great Womb out there, has 
numerous effects. It obfuscates the image 
of himself looking into a woman’s uterus, 
it generalizes his implied voyeuristic 
desire to all females, and it separates 
the idea of “the womb” from the individ­
ual people — women — whose anato­
mies include a uterus. It also inflates
Editor:
This letter is presented in response to 
the articles written about Carnegie 
Mellon Dining Service and published in 
the University’s student newspapers 
[editorial in the 10/4 Tartan and “Toxic 
Swill” in the Student Union]. I am a 
freshman in MCS who works presently 
in the Kiltie Cafe as a food “prepper.” I 
have worked approximately sixty hours 
so far this semester at Kiltie and have 
been exposed to some facets of dining 
service that most students have not and
I believe that I may talk about Dining 
Service procedures with some back­
ground in both sides.
Please, before reading any further, 
understand and note that I do not in any 
way mean to be Dining Service’s “Cham­
pion.” Actually, the articles have pre­
sented many valid complaints, and I 
believe that Dining Service is obligated 
to deal with the complaints and modify 
procedures accordingly. Neither of the 
articles provided any solutions or even 
made constructive criticism, but seemed 
to focus on how the authors didn’t per­
sonally like the way things were done. 
One of the authors felt justified enough 
in their opinion to be able to make offen­
sive remarks as an attempt at some type 
of humor.
I feel justifies in the use of the term 
“offensive.” As a worker at Kiltie, I am 
directly responsible for the quality of 
the service line and directly responsible 
for the quality of the food. I do not hold 
my breath with anticipation at the pros­
pect of going to work at Kiltie, but nev­
ertheless I have obligations and respon­
sibilities. The work that I do at Kiltie is 
not very glamorous, but it is something
the specific instance of a uterus into a 
loaded ideological realm where The 
Womb symbolizes a haven. Fartro seems 
to want to argue about uteri, or The 
Uterus, rather than about living, 
thinking, whole women. All I can say is 
keep your gaze — and your laws — out 
of my uterus.
I wish to point-out only a few more 
interesting spots in this veritable 
snakepit of linguistic situations. 
Throughout his piece, Fartro never uses 
the active voice when implying that there 
should be a law against abortion; he 
thus obscures the potential agent of 
denial of women’s choice: the Supreme 
Court — virtually all men — appointed 
by a man, influenced by a minority of 
Americans who wish to see abortion 
illegalized. He talks about “pro-abor­
tion” attitudes in relation to Mr. Dukakis, 
whom he has just quoted as saying “I 
don’t favor abortion.”
Fartro’s last sentence is: “By leaving 
that definition to the mother, millions of 
mothers are erroneously deciding to let 
their babies be killed.” Here, he strains 
so hard for the passive voice that he 
misplaces a modifier (good luck in tech­
nical writing, Mr. Fartro), implying that 
mothers are “leaving that definition” to 
“the mother.” In the same sentence, he 
renders mothers passive victims of abor­
tion who “let their babies be killed.” In 
fact, women quite actively decide to have 
abortions, have always done so, and will 
always continue to do so. Given that, 
let’s keep abortion safe and legal.

that needs to be done. Despite the fact 
that it is not what I want to do with my 
life, I still leave work with a feeling of 
pride that I was able to accomplish 
something, and for the authors of thé 
articles to take “pot shots” at my work 
without regard to what is really happen­
ing professionally and personally insults 
me. There are others who work full-time 
forCMDSand spend large quantities of 
time trying to provide “us students” with 
a valuable service. They do not appreci­
ate the “pot shots” and constant attri« 
tion from the student body. Working on 
both sides I see the constant student 
discrimination (“Hey, you, bring me some 
ketchup. Do ya got my pizza? What’s 
that crap?”) and have actually been in 
situations where acquaintances have 
ignored me my while I wear the CMDS 
uniform. Please remember that Worker^ 
Student relations is a two-sided street.
I would like to object to the style of 
writing and lack of journalistic integrity 
in the articles. Only one even attempted 
to contact Dining Service for some an* 
swers, and the meaning of the text of the 
article that held the citation was so 
skillfully twisted that I could not believe 
how out of context the citation was. (I 
refer to the reference in the 10/4 Tartan, 
citing Dining Service Director Ji® 
Gurley.) Peruse the articles. Nowhere

H&SS Core isn’t what it should be
Ever wonder what the purpose 
of all those core H&SS courses 
is? According to the college cata- 
, the core curriculum is “A 
diverse... array of courses that 
irovides a common base of skills, 
concepts, perspectives and knowl­
edge (italics mine) in a wide range 
of fields.” It’s purpose is “...to 
give all H&SS students the intel­
lectual tools required to under­
stand today’s world — tools of 
literacy, ...(italics mine).”
Sounds like a noble purpose. 
Unfortunately, as is often the 
case, what sounds good on paper 
'does not work in practice. In­
stead of creating well-rounded 
ptudents who have at least a con­
versational knowledge of each of 
fhe various departments, stu­
dents get a very intense, short 
look at a tiny area within each 
discipline. This does not by any 
stretch of the imagination bring 
about well rounded knowledge 
and literacy.
I spoke about the philosophy 
department last week and it is a 
£ood example. Students will be 
able to work fairly difficult logic 
problems by the end of the course, 
but will not be able to under­
stand allusions to Plato’s Repub­
lic when they come up in other 
contexts. They will have a skill
60 Coarse 
Michael D.C. Drout
and a very specific knowledge, 
but will not have the “common 
base” of information they are 
supposed to be getting.
In History, we studied “Social 
History instead of more tradi­
tional histories that focus on high 
culture and political develop­
ments” (a quote from the Intro to 
World History Midterm my fresh­
man year). Studying the com­
mon man is by no means wrong, 
but when we neglect the high 
culture (“Study Rome without 
mentioning an emperor’s name”) 
we lose the broad base of knowl­
edge that such information is a 
part of. If a student does not 
know who Nero and Diocletian 
and Constantine were before he 
or she takes Intro to World His­
tory, he or she will still not know 
when he or she comes out. While 
the information about the com­
mon man is certainly important, 
the knowledge of the high cul­
ture is part of that “common base 
of... knowledge” described in the 
catalog.
There are other core courses
that do not disregard the tradi­
tional subject matter for their 
discipline. Cognitive Psychology, 
with its first few units describing 
the history of psychology is a good 
example. While students do not 
get as much information as they 
might in a standard introductory 
psych course, they do get some. 
And they gain the benefit of dis­
covering what state of the art 
thinking is in Cognitive Science.
The H&SS core curriculum is 
obviously not fulfilling its stated 
purpose. Instead of giving stu­
dents “literacy” and a “common 
base of... knowledge,” the core 
has degenerated to a forum for 
Carnegie Mellon’s various de­
partments to promote their re­
search agendas. While the re­
search done here is certainly 
interesting, and state of the art 
thinking does need to be expli­
cated, neglecting traditional 
content of core disciplines not 
only violates the stated purpose 
of the core curriculum, it insures 
that a Carnegie Mellon educa­
tion will never be up to the stan­
dards the university hopes to 
achieve.

Words of wisdom: Art’s sound bites
In order to keep up with the 
election scene, you have to be 
able to say something intelligent 
so that people are aware of your 
knowledge of presidential poli­
tics. Here are a few things you 
can mutter to impress friends 
and strangers alike:
- “My puppy and Danny Quayle 
play together in the same park.”
“The thing I admire most about 
George Bush is that he was out­
side the loop when President 
Reagan was in it.”
1 “Michael Dukakis always looks 
as if he has just eaten airline
food.” __
' “IfBentsen loses he’s going 
to become a card-carrying 
inember of American Ex­
press.”
“The fact that George 
•Bush’s father stole 
Geronimo’s skull when he 
was a member of the Yale 
Skull and Bones Fraternity 
doesn’t mean that the Vice 
President won’t carry out the ~ 
laws of the land.”
• “I would rather have a Vice 
President who looked like Robert 
Redford than someone who 
looked like Karl Malden.”
“The only choice the voter has 
in this election is whether to trust
Art Buchwald
Dan Quayle, or Lloyd Bentsen to 
represent the United States at 
Emperor Hirohito’s funeral.” 
“Mike Dukakis doesn’t just 
have a stiff upper lip — he’s stiff 
all over.”
“I wish the ticket was Quayle 
and Bentsen. That way I would 
have no problem deciding which 
one I wanted to debate Raisa 
Gorbachev.”
“If Bentsen loses 
he's going to be­
come a card-carrying 
member of American 
Express. ”
“People should get off George 
Bush’s back because his friend 
Noriega didn’t go to Vietnam. 
Anyone who served in the Pan­
ama National Guard was no draft 
dodger.”
HERBLOCK’S CARTOON
WHICH UPS ARE WE StIPPOSEP TO REAP?"
“I think if Bush becomes Presi­
dent and pardons Ollie North, he 
should also pardon the person 
who came up with the idea of 
naming Dan Quayle as his run­
ning mate.”
“Each time Dukakis comes up 
with a health-care plan, the defi­
cit gets sick.”
“Somebody told me that if Dan 
Quayle is elected, he’s going to 
make it possible for every man 
and woman in this country to get 
into law school — on a minority 
program.”
“The reason you haven’t heard 
_ from Bentsen is that he’s 
been driving cattle across 
Texas from Amarillo to 
Houston.”
“The only purpose in giv­
ing money to your party is so 
that it will be used to buy 
dirty, sleazy TV commercials 
to educate the' American 
people.”
“I’d rather have Dan
— Quayle’s finger on the nu­
clear button than a lot of the 
teen-age kids in our neighbor­
hood.”
“My brother is a podiatrist, and 
he says that the reason Dukakis 
doesn’t smile when he is sitting 
down is because his feet won’t 
touch the floor.”
“If Bentsen ever got a sound 
bite on the news, he wouldn’t 
know what to do with it.”
“I’m sick and tired of jokes about 
Bush and Pearl Harbor. Bush 
was trying to say that what makes 
this country great is the fact we 
can observe a day of infamy any 
time we want to.”
“If I was Dan Quayle and I was 
running for Vice President of the 
United States, I wouldn’t answer 
any questions either.”
“The wonderful thing about de­
bates is that nobody has to tell 
the truth as long as the red light 
at the top of the camera is on.”

Forget about junior year abroad...
Try this exchange program instead
This column is dedicated to 
an unnamed junior ECE who 
has made it through two years 
at Carnegie Mellon without 
entering the College of Fine 
Aji:s building and a half-dozen 
other buildings on campus. 
Unfortunately, for ECEs, he’s 
not that uncommon (I feel that 
given the ECE department, 
identifying gender will not 
compromise his anonymity).
Carnegie Mellon is a lot like 
the city it’s located in — a 
bunch of little communities 
that have absolutely nothing 
in common with each other. 
While fruits and vegetables 
are only mentioned by high 
school seniors who’ve read 
those same college guides that 
claim we all hang out in Gray 
Matter, we have an isolating 
campus.
The school already partici­
pates in several semester 
abroad programs, so why not 
extend the same principle 
right here at home? Students 
exchanging colleges instead of
Inquiring Minds

schools would still need to learn 
a foreign language, but the travel 
costs would be much less.
The Inter-College Exchange 
Program would allow juniors 
from various parts of the campus 
to live out their favorite stere­
otypes, spending a semester as 
Atticus Finch would put it “climb­
ing into the skin of another man 
and walking around for a while.”
Art majors, wouldn’t you love 
to be able to spend weeks at a 
time without showering? Play 
weird games during all hours of 
the day? Experience the thrill of 
seeing the sun rise after all-night 
hacking sessions?
Computer Science types, 
wouldn’t you love to have a com­
pletely black wardrobe? Play 
weird music at all hours of the 
day? Experience the thrill of 
seeing the sun rise after all-night
sessions finishing your portfo­
lios?
Imagine the potential re­
sults: musicians in Scaife Hall, 
physicists in Forbes Gallery, 
GSIA students in the Frater­
nity Quad, Amnesty Interna­
tional at College Republicans 
meetings. You know, people 
might realize that we’re not 
all that different.
Then again, that’s probably 
just wishful thinking. After all, 
we all know that they’re dif­
ferent, in fact weird. It’s a 
requirement for their depart­
ments.
Oh well, perhaps we should 
all go on campus tours instead. 
That way, we’d be guaranteed 
to see the insides of each build­
ing at least once. Besides, you 
should hear the things they 
say about us fruits and veg­
gies.

Fear tactics don’t belong in Senate
Senate is a menagerie of char­
acters: would-be politicians (of 
course), people who care about 
CMU, those who just need some­
thing to do. The group even has 
two leading factions and swing 
votes, just like the real world.
Last week’s meeting brought 
back memories of before we were 
all born. When the use of fear 
was the norm and rational 
thought wasn’t.
Before we go on, read the front 
page story on Senate and the Gay
Never-ending Story 
David N. Levy ____________
Rights resolution if you haven’t 
by now. The rest of this is my 
opinion on the proceedings and 
you should have your own before 
reading further.
When Chuck Jainchill brought 
the modified resolution to Sen­
ate there was some quick discus­
sion in favor of passing the reso-
HERBLOCK’S CARTOON
”1PÜNNO—IKINPA LIKE WHAT BUSH SAP 
ABOUT A THOUSANP PINTS OF LITE"
lution. Then there was more dis­
cussion about why Senate should 
continue to table the resolution 
until a copy of the ordinance was 
brought to Senate. When this was 
brought up, Matt Ruben began to 
talk about fear.
He said that the ordinance that 
had failed the council was just 
like any other equal rights bills 
but that it was inserting the 
words “sexual preference.” He 
went on to say that those who 
insisted in seeing a copy of the 
actual law before passing the 
resolution were showing fear. It 
was OK to show that fear but 
they should realize that they were 
doing so.
I guess that he is right. But to 
say things like that in a place 
that is very public and to tell 
people that they are showing that 
fear is wrong. It causes the swing 
votes to vote with you because 
they are scared. Mr. Ruben, you 
did what another senator named 
McCarthy did all those many 
years ago.
You kept a conversation in 
Points of Discussion going, call­
ing all those who didn’t precisely 
agree with you fearful. Did you 
hope to get your name in the 
Senate Minutes? Did you hope to 
get your name in the papers? Or 
were you trying to see how much 
power you really did have over 
people?
Fear is a powerful weapon. One 
late author called it the mind- 
killer. In political decisions it is 
exactly that. By using it in your 
own personal agenda, Mr. Ruben, 
you take away your credibility. 
You got this quickly passed and 
quickly vetoed. You undermined 
what you were doing and you’ve 
made it harder for others to trust 
you.
And if you can’t be trusted as a 
senator Mr. Ruben, how can you 
be trusted at all?
David Levy is a Senior in IM 
who has just as many fears as 
everyone else, but refuses to have 
someone else manipulate his 
fears.
Danny and George say the darndest things
Politicians say the darndest 
things. And nobody says the 
darndest like George Bush.
An editorial I wrote in high 
school quoted Bush from when 
he visited the Philippines. The 
Vice-President toasted vote- 
stealing President Marcos say­
ing, “We admire you for your 
adherence to the democratic prin­
ciple.”
I’ve had a fondness for Bush 
quotes since that editorial won 
fifty dollars in a contest. I’ve been 
quoting him ever since.
But here’s my favorite quote 
from 1980, when Bush was run­
ning for President against Ronald 
Reagan:
“There’s absolutely no reason 
why we can’t have t>vo decades of
Eric W. Leuliette
peace in the ’80s.”
I don’t know, I can think of a 
reason.
And who can forget Bush’s most 
famous quote from the ’80 cam­
paign about Reaganomics: “Voo­
doo economics.”
Not to worry. Bush has been 
kinder to Reagan lately. Here’s 
what Bush, Vice-President to 
former California Governor 
Ronald Reagan, had to say about 
the present Governor George 
Deukmejian:
“He will go down in my book as 
the great governor of the State of
California.”
But I think I most admire 
Bush’s expert knowledge of his­
tory. Who else would say that 
Pearl Harbor Day was in Sep­
tember?
And so it’s no coincidence that 
Bush’s runningmate Dan Quayle 
also has the same tight grasp of 
historical events. Here’s what he 
had to say about the Holocaust: 
“An obscene period in our nation’s 
history.”
Then again, he wasn’t even 
alive during War World II.
So they’ve got a few facts wrong. 
Here’s how Bush said he felt 
about facts when the U.S. Navy 
shot down an Iranian airliner: “I 
will never apologize for the 
United States—I don’t care what
the facts are.”
But there’s no need to worry 
about facts, Bush knows exactly 
what he stands for: “I hope I 
stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semi­
tism, anti-racism. This is what 
drives me.” I have never known 
of anyone to go after the anti- 
Semitism vote.
So I’m being a little unfair to 
Bush. I’m sorry, but Dukakis 
hasn’t made many gaffes. So if 
George can keep dishing ’em out 
like this, maybe I can put up with 
him for four years. Besides, I 
could use fifty more bucks.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 18 October 19889
Mathematics an essential part of philosophy courses, says one prof
Editor:
Michael Drout has written a 
courteous and thoughtful criti­
cism of the new curriculum in 
philosophy 80-100 (“H&SS stu­
dents underfed when it comes to 
ihilosophy” The Tartan, 27, Sep­
tember 1988). Mr. Drout thinks 
an introduction of philosophy 
should provide an historical treat­
ment of the subject. The present 
curriculum instead provides a 
¡ontemporary treatment focused 
on theories of rationality and 
bounded rationality. The core of 
these theories has a mathemati­
cal structure, and so the course 
has considerable mathematical 
content, which Mr. Drout holds 
to be inappropriate in an intro­
duction to philosophy. I would 
like to reply.
In many subjects there are two 
ways in which an introductory 
course can be organized. One is 
historical. It has students read 
the history of the subject, at least 
partly from the primary texts or 
their translations. Another way 
presents some of the accepted 
results of the subject, introduces- 
contemporary methods, and il­
lustrates their applications. Each 
form of organization may have a 
bit of the other; and historical 
presentation may sometimes look 
forward, a contemporary intro­
duction may sometimes look 
backwards.
Physics or chemistry or biology 
or economics or psychology or 
calculus or philosophy could each 
be introduced in either way. In 
practice, introductory courses in 
the natural and behavioral sci­
ences are rarely introduced his­
torically, and students would find 
it puzzling if they were. Imagine 
what a serious historical intro­
duction to physics might be like; 
Students would read about 
Democritus and other pre-So- 
cratics; they would read Plato's
Letters to the Editor
Theatetus and extensive/parts 
of Aristotole‘s writings: they 
would study Aristarchus’ <psmol- 
ogy, Euclid’s Elements and 
Ptolemy’s Almagest. They would 
read about medieval Arab optics 
and samples of medieval Euro­
pean writings on impetus me­
chanics. They wouldj 
read Copernicus’ DeJ 
Revolutionibus and 
Kepler’s Epitome of 
Copernican Astron­
omy and Harmonica 
Mundi, along witr.
Galileo’s two most fa­
mous books. The.T 
would read Huyghen’s 
theories of collision ani 
wave motioi,
Descartes’ Principles,
Pascal and Boyle m 
pneumatics and th< “spring of 
the air,” and Descirtes’ Prin­
ciples. Perhaps to finish up, 
Nev/ton’s Principii and Optics. 
No mathematics save arithme­
tic, Euclidean geonetry and trigo­
nometry would be used. Most of 
the science studied would, from a 
modern point of view, be very 
much in error. Ev^en the approxi­
mately correct science, such as 
Newton’s Prircipia, would be 
studied throufh archaic meth­
ods.
An interesting course, no doubt, 
but not whst we expect in an 
introductior to physics. Some­
thing like ifis done in only a few 
universities, such as St. John’s. 
Physics /his a body of accepted 
results/teethods and applications 
and' physics teachers generally 
judge/hat however good it would 
be tonave a deep historical per­
spective, the first task is to un- 
der/tand things from a more con­
temporary point of view. Much 
the same could be said about 
chemistry, biology, calculus, eco­
nomics or psychology.
Why should philosophy be any 
different? Why should an intro­
duction to the subject focus on 
history rather than introduce 
accepted results, methods and 
applications? Many of the same 
authors would appear in an his­

tion to physics or psychology. 
Plato, Aristotle, Descartes and 
Galileo would reasonably be in­
cluded in all three.
I think some people expect 
philosophy to be historical be­
cause they don’t think there are 
any philosophical results. They 
think, essentially, that we know 
nothing more1 now about any of 
the central questions of the philo­
sophical tradition than did Plato 
or Aristotle or Descartes or Kant. 
That is false. The modern theory 
of rationality, including logic, 
aspects of probability thoery, and 
decision theory are philosophical 
results. So is the modern under­
standing of bounded rationality 
that derives from the theory of 
computation. So is the contem­
porary formal study of discovery 
procedures. Each of these sub­
jects was created in part by philo­
sophical writers, and their appli­
cations were spurred by profes­
sional philosophers. More to the 
point, each of these subjects is 
the fulfillment of more than 2,000 
years of philosophical effort. 
Aristotle and Descartes would 
have wanted to have our theory 
of proof and entailment; Hobbes 
would have wanted to have our 
understanding of computability 
and bounded rationality; Hume 
and Kant would have wished to 
have our understanding of dis­
covery problems. Pascal, Ben- 
tham and Mill 
would have wished 
to know our con­
ception of probabil­
ity and utility.
Philosophy 80- 
100 offers a rigor­
ous but elemen­
tary introduction 
to the modern the­
ory of rationality
------------— and bounded ra-
^m tionality, and then
shows some of the 
applications of those theories to 
traditional philosophical issues 
including the nature and limits 
of human knowledge, the phi­
losophy of science, the nature of 
mind, freedom of the will, ethics, 
and the structure of a just soci­
ety. Many of the views of Plato, 
Aristotle, Pascal, Bacon, Hobbes, 
Hume, Kant, Mill and Marx are 
briefly described, but historical 
exegesis is not the principal aim 
of the course, nor should it be. 
The, course is partly mathemati­
cal because the central contem­
porary results of the philosophi­
cal tradition are partly mathe­
matical. It is a difficult course; it 
would be far more difficult to try 
to extract as much insight from 
historical readings.
It is certainly valuable, once 
some grounding has been ob­
tained, to study the historical 
texts of the great philosophers.

Males anti-abortion argument insensitive to women
Editor:
Having written for a national 
award winning high school pa­
per for three years prior to com­
ing to Carnegie Mellon, I wasf 
rather disappointed to find tha) 
the Tartan’s coverage of feature/ 
is at best tasteless and soph« 
moric, of news stories, bland ard 
lacking in depth, and of editcri- 
, missing the sense of insi/ht 
that college students are /re­
sumed to possess. However/leff 
Fartro’s column on abortion of 
-October 4th [“Fetal Dilenma”] 
¦goes beyond bad taste. Onceagain 
‘the Tartan has proved tha it can 
;sink to new lows in what it/hooses 
'.to print.
I find it offensive thai the au­
thor of a column on a /women’s 
¦issue” resorts to usingthe same 
ignorant insensitive argument 
that most male antiabortionists 
ruse. Thank goodness/oryou, Mr. 
Fartro, that you pei^onally will 
never have to makethe decision 
to terminate a pregnincy. Mother 
Nature has spared you the • 
trouble of having e^er to face this 
problem. But unfirtunately, by 
virtue of your gerder, you are at 
a disadvantage n arguing your 
position in a pub^c forum. With a 
little more investigation and con­
templation, yov could have writ­
ten a thought provoking column 
that offended relatively few 
People.
As a biology major, I acknowl- 
edge the complete validity of the 
argument that abortion is the 
taking of g human life. It sad­
dens me deeply that many thou­
sands of women have to even 
consider this decision. What 
Wakes the whole situation worse 
18 that antiabortionists are so 
Quick to defend the fetus and 
condemn the mother. Perhaps it 
ls because the fetus is innocent 
3nd lacking any responsibility 
for its own existence. It makes no 
difference that the mother lives 
ln a society that perpetuates 
ttixed messages on sexuality, 
that people who are in principle 
against abortion condone irre­
sponsible sexual behavior, and 
^at ultimately there is also a 
father who shares in the respon­
sibility of the creation of this new 
^e- It is the mother who ulti­
mately bears the guilt and re­
sponsibility.
The options for a woman facing 
1 an unwanted pregnancy are all 
bleak. If the woman decides to 
have the child' and raise it her­
self, she is often shamed by her 
family and friends, abandoned 
by the child’s father, and saddled 
with a responsibility so great that 
even those who willingly seek it 
within a socially acceptable ar­
rangement such as marriage find 
it to be an overwhelming respon­
sibility. If she chooses to give the 
baby up for adoption, she is left to 
deal with the greatest separa­
tion anxiety any person could 
possibly imagine: being left to 
wonder what her child’s life is 
like. The only other option left 
available is probably the worst: 
abortion.
To choose to have an abortion 
is to consciously decide to make a 
difficult bioethical and moral 
decision: my life versus my child’s 
life. Any woman who makes this 
decision is accepting responsibil­
ity for taking life. She is asking 
no one else to share in the burden 
of guilt she will carry for the rest 
of her life. Antiabortionists tend 
to do little to help mitigate the 
guilt; most of them worsen the 
situation. In fact, if abortions 
were illegal many economically 
disadvantaged women would be 
risking their future health and 
lives in filthy unsafe back alleys. 
While you may disagree with the 
notion that women should have 
the right to an abortion, is it fair 
for you to make the decision that 
these women should pay with 
their sanity and their lives for a 
mistake that may not have been 
entirely their fault? Is it also pre­
sumptuous for women who, in 
essence, have been victimized 
several times over by society to 
ask for the right to be responsible 
for their own decisions, just as it 
was once presumptuous for them 
to ask for suffrage or equal pro­
tection of the other “basic rights” 
under the Constitution?
The fundamental problem with 
most pro-choice and pro-life ac­
tivists is that they deal only with 
the symptoms of the problem and 
ignore the causes. I too would 
like to do away with abortion.
The responsibility for the abor­
tion problem lies deeper than just 
the mother. It lies with the fa­
ther who shares in the responsi­
bility of having created life. More­
over, it also lies with every single 
one of us and our irresponsible 
attitudes towards sex. Perhaps if 
each of us would own up to our 
own responsibilities instead of 
badgering and belittling each

provide both contemporary foun­
dations and serious historical 
study, even of an introductory 
kind, in a single course, which is 
why the Philosophy department 
offers each year a number of 
courses addressing the history of 
philosophy. This year they in­
clude course in modern philoso­
phy (from the 17th to the 19th 
centuries), 19th century philoso­
phy, 20th century philosophy, 
and an historically oriented 
course in the philosophy of reli­
gion. Last year they included a 
course on Ancient philosophy, as 
they will next year.
Mr Drout cites Alan Bloom’s 
recent book, and its endorsement 
by the former Secretary of Edu­
cation, William Bennett. Mr. 
Bloom is not a philosopher by 
profession, and his views are 
widely despised by his philosophi­
cal colleagues at the University 
of Chicago. Mr. Bennett is a 
former professor of philosophy, 
although not a distinguished one. 
Repute aside, there is a simple 
point: what Mr. Bloom advocates 
is not philosophy as the great 
philosophers practiced it. Plato 
required that all who study with 
him know the fanciest mathe­
matics of his day, which was 
geometry. Aristotle wrote dis­
cussions of the views of his prede­
cessors, the pre-Socratics, but he 
held them to the standard of 
knowledge of his own day and to 
the most rigorous theory of infer­
ence of his time, not theirs. He, 
Aristotle, created the theory of 
inference. Descartes, Leibniz and 
Pascal did not separate their
philosophy from their logical 
theory and their mathematics. 
Kant was steeped in the physics 
of his day, as was Locke in his, 
and each of them formed their 
views of mind and knowledge in 
concert with their scientific un­
derstanding. Those who urge 
that in philosophy we ignore 
contemporary achievements, 
contemporary science and con­
temporary mathematics are pro­
posing an activity that our best 
philosophical ancestors would 
have thought unphilosophical 
and absurd. They are really 
proposing abandoning philoso­
phy as it has been done for two 
and one half millenia.
I agree with Mr. Drout that an 
undergraduate education is in­
complete without some system­
atic attempt at understanding 
the history of Western thought. 
That includes the history of reli­
gion, of science, and of philoso­
phy. For most of our history their 
separation is artificial. Although 
there are courses in the Univer­
sity that address each of these 
topics, I don’t know any single 
Gourse that provides a unified 
survey. Perhaps there should be 
one, or perhaps any such course 
would inevitably be too superfi­
cial to be of much value. In any 
case, for many reasons, includ­
ing those I have just given, I do 
not think that should be the role 
of an introductory course in phi­
losophy.

Homosexuality article 
“gave credence to bigotry”
other, it might be possible to 
preclude the need for abortions 
altogether. The cliche about an 
ounce of prevention in the form of 
accepting responsibility for one’s 
actions- and for educating others 
is certainly more acceptable than 
the existing cures.
Susan Olson 
Sophomore, Biology
Editor:
Donna Grear defends the neu­
trality of her article concerning 
homosexuality at CMU when she 
writes, “I purposely did not take 
a stand for or against homosexu-. 
ality so that I could present the 
information I received in an 
unbiased manner.” She also 
states that, “I think that every­
one should make a decision con­
cerning the issue and then stand 
by that decision, whatever it may 
be.”
The very notion that there is a 
legitimate “decision” to be made 
gives credence to those practic­
ing bigotry and hatred. A sugges­
tion, regardless of its intent, that 
a similar decision be made about 
blacks and women would justly 
be deemed racist and sexist, re­
spectively. In this case, the word 
homophobic would apply.
By saying that “one can accept 
someone without agreeing with 
that person,” Grear suggests that 
one may legitimately “disagree” 
with homosexuality but still ac­
cept gays. If I were to tell a black 
person that I “disagree” with your 
blackness, but don’t worry, I still 
accept you, I would expect re­
sponses to range from laughter 
(in disbelief) to responses which 
may be on the violent side. There 
is nothing to disagree with in 
terms of an individual’s sexual 
orientation. It is a fact, not a 
choice or belief. For anyone to 
honestly believe that a child 
reaching puberty would con­
sciously “decide” to be gay in a 
homophobic society and face the 
ridicule of peers, and the dis­
crimination and bigotry of others
— including one’s own family 
members — is so ludicrous as to 
not merit a response. How many 
people actually remember choos­
ing their sexual orientation?
Grear does not realize that one 
cannot reasonably be expected to 
“take a stand” about homosexu­
ality or “make a decision about 
the issue.” Homosexuality has 
only one side — it exists. Not ac­
cepting its existence, as in not 
acknowledging the existence of 
the sexes or the variety of ethnic 
or racial groups is simply not 
dealing with reality. The issue 
that has two sides to which Grear 
is really referring, is bigotry. 
Grear is not being neutral about 
homosexuality because there is 
nothing to be neutral about. She 
is being “neutral” about bigotry.
Thus, the two sides are divided 
into those who accept homosexu­
ality and those who are bigots. If 
an individual has decided to be a 
bigot, Grear advises that indi­
vidual to “stand by that decision, 
whatever that may be.” Is it any 
wonder that she cannot under­
stand why Nathan Long asserted 
in his letter to the Tartan that, 
“the article was a political move 
to create complacency on cam­
pus?”
Grear states, “I still do not think 
that prejudice is the reason that 
many heterosexuals feel uncom­
fortable about homosexuals,” and 
that, “acceptance doesn’t neces­
sarily mean you are comfortable 
with someone. There are certain 
people whose personalities in­
timidate or annoy me, yet I ac­
cept them.” What is this if it is 
not prejudice? Personality refers 
to, among other things, individ­
ual character and an ability to 
relate with others. This is not the 
case with sexual orientation or 
other similar categories where 
individuals are judged by stere­
otypes applied to a whole group, 
rather than beingjudged by their 
individual character. Obviously, 
as Grear states, not every indi­
vidual likes or feels comfortable 
around every other individual. 
Granted, but if one’s dislike or 
discomfort can be attributed to 
race, ethnicity, sex, or sexual 
orientation, it is rooted in big­
otry. To suggest that one can 
harbor such negative feelings and 
not discriminate is to imply that 
individuals treat people they like 
and dislike equally. How many 
people can honestly make such a 
claim?
Grear suggests a distinction 
between a homosexual orienta­
tion and practicing homosexual­
ity through her acknowledge­
ment of people with a homosex­
ual orientation and her discus­
sion about “agreeing or disagree­
ing” with it. This is another ex­
ample of disguising bigotry 
through the creation of such a 
contrived distinction. Many op­
ponents of gay rights legislation 
also try to make this distinction. 
For instance, Bishop Wuerl from 
the Catholic Diocese of Pitts., 
stated that he had no qualms 
with a homosexual orientation, 
but rather with its practice. Post

Better scheduling is solution 
to poor turnout at AB’s dances
Editor:
In response to Richard Ford’s 
letter of October 4 [“AB puzzled 
by low turnout at dances”], I’d 
like to give a shot at solving his 
puzzle regarding low attendance 
at dances.
I joined AB Dance last year 
intending to help out a little, and 
instead found myself over­
whelmed with work and worries. 
The first two dances on which I 
helped featured The Flow and 
George Gee and his Make-Be­
lieve Ballroom Orchestra. They 
were tremendous successes 
last semester. I believe this 
is accountable to the tim­
ing. By spring semester, 
people are bored with the 
same old things every week­
end and dances are a re­
freshing change. I worked 
on the first dance this fall 
and then left AB Dance be­
cause my opinions differed 
so radically from Richard 
Ford’s.
The first two dances this m 
year occurred during Fra­
ternity Rush. At this point in 
time, approximately 34% of the 
campus is Greek, and during 
Rush as much as 50% of the 
campus is somehow involved. The 
Blues Dance occurred on the big­
gest party night of the year—the 
night of fraternity theme par­
ties. I told Richard Ford atten­
dance would be low, because two 
bands, no matter how good, can­
not compete with Dante, Heaven, 
Hell, Jungles and Beaches. Rich­
ard disagreed and spent thou­
sands from our activities fee on a 
dance that would inevitably flop. 
The guest band, the Uptown 
Rhythm Kings, was angry and 
embarrassed at the poor turn­
out. They were fully aware of the 
fraternity parties which could be 
heard in the ballroom. The lead 
singer complained to me about 
scheduling and said he would not
return to CMU for some time. He 
and his band were outstanding. 
The second dance was a repeat of 
the first. Cost of decorations was 
high, and manhours put in by 
very devoted AB Dance and AB 
Tech people was higher. Still, it 
flopped. And still, Richard is 
puzzled.
I think the third dance will go 
well. The Flow is a very popular 
reggae band with at least one 
campus organization avidly back­
ing them. The dance hopefully 
will be held outside on thé Cut on
“Shall I tell you that the 
“Big Band Bash ” falls 
on the night of all the 
Halloween parties on 
campus (Saturday, 
October 29)?"
Homecoming weekend. Not so 
much of our activities fee is going 
toward it this time, but a lot more 
of us will be able to enjoy it since 
the timing is, at last, right.
Does anyone care to lay bets on 
the biggest, best, most expensive 
dance of the semester featuring 
none other than Tommy Dorsey’s 
Orchestra? Shall I tell you that 
this “Big Band Bash” falls on the 
night of all the Halloween par­
ties on. campus (i.e. Saturday,
October 29)? I know a lot of people 
who would love to attend the 
dance, but the same people also 
don’t want to miss the fun of Hal­
loween.
I mentioned this to Richard 
and he responded that it was also 
freshman parent’s weekend and 
he expected a good turnout from 
parents. Well isn’t that nice? A Anne Wulffraat 
dance that many students would Junior, IM
like to attend, they will miss, but 
freshman parents will enjoy. Isn’t 
AB Dance for the students? (Isn’t 
the ACTIVITIES FEE for the 
students?)
The dances are scheduled based 
on the dates the ballroom could 
be reserved. These being few and 
far between, AB Dance got the 
dates no one else wanted. But 
where was AB Dance when bet­
ter nights were still available? 
And why allow the time, effort 
and money of a lot of people to be 
put to waste? One or two success­
ful dances a semester, 
well-timed and well-ad- 
vertised would be much 
more valuable to the stu­
dents than four poorly 
executed dances no one 
will attend.
Ford stated, “atten­
dance is not the only 
measure of success. AB 
Dance judges success by 
standards which include 
providing a smoothly run 
event with good music 
and atmosphere.” So, in 
essence, a smoothly run dance 
with no attendants is a success­
ful AB Dance venture. So when 
no one shows up but the decora­
tions are pretty and the music 
sounds good, Richard is pleased. 
Did you pay your activities fee to 
please Richard Ford?
So, Richard, your puzzle is not 
so puzzling. AB Dance is here to 
serve the campus community, 
which means taking into account 
other organizations and their 
activities. Dances cannot be 
scheduled to Richard Ford’s con­
venience. To be a success, dances 
should be held when it appears 
that the most students possible 
can enjoy them. The quality of 
the dances is superb. It is your 
timing, Richard, that is so far off.
Director says CMDS committed 
to service and student input
Editor:
In response to the October 4 
editorial “Carnegie Mellon 
Dining Service,” I would like to 
express the sentiments of the 
CMDS management team and 
our dedicated employees.
We are very much interested 
in knowing how students per­
ceive the quality and value of 
CMDS. We have for years con­
ducted Comment Tables in our 
various dining facilities for the 
express purpose fo gaining feed­
back from students, and for that 
matter, staff and faculty of Car­
negie Mellon. I personally co­
chair a Food Committee with the 
Student Dormitory Council to 
review our various services and 
determine how we can better 
meet he need and wants of stu­
dents. Both of these communica­
tion channels have proven to be 
effective in helping us respond to 
problems as they are perceived 
by our patrons. We believe the
Comment Tables and Food Com­
mittee demonstrate the commit­
ment to ongoing improvement 
that exists in Dining Service.
During the first committee 
meeting of the year (Sept. 29), 
the following topics cited in your 
article were addressed: MOREP- 
IZZA — Breaded Cheese Sticks 
were sampled and the portion/ 
price amounts were agreed upon. 
The Cheese Sticks were pre­
sented on the menu as of Monday 
Oct. 10. MOREWOOD DINING
— The Ice Cream Coupon policy 
was reviewed and determined to 
be equitable. TARTAN GRILL— 
The “feeder line” service format 
was discussed and alternative 
suggestions will be presented by 
students at the next SDC Food 
Committee meeting (Oct. 20).

hicle by which meal contract

Abortion decision not up to one person
Editor:
In his October 4th editorial, 
Jeff Fartro attacks Michael 
Dukakis for leaving the choice of 
abortion up to the women them­
selves. He asserts that Dukakis 
“side-stepped” the issue by not 
condemning or advocating abor­
tion. Mr. Fartro, however, made 
his position clear. He feels quali­
fied to make the decision for 
women, that somehow they are 
not capable of doing so them­
selves. He says, “By leaving that 
definition to the mother, millions 
of mothers are erroneously de­
ciding to let their babies be killed.”
Mr. Fartro has made his deci­
sion and so has Vice President 
Bush. Women are wrong. They 
are right, in a sort of Big Brother 
I-know-what’s-best-for-you 
sense. More insightful observers 
like Mr. Dukakis, however, real­
ize that the issue is not so cut and
dried. He said, “I do not favor 
abortion. I don’t think it’s a good 
idea.. .The question is who makes 
the decision.” Is this “masking 
the issue,” as Mr. Fartro asserts?
I don’t think so. I think Mr. 
Dukakis knows that he’s not in 
the position to make that deci­
sion for all the women of this 
country.
Unless I’m mistaken, George 
Bush has never been pregnant. A 
person, man or woman, who has 
never been in the situation of an 
unwanted pregnancy can very 
easily say “Why of course a fetus 
is a person. I’d never have an 
abortion.” I bet a lot of those 
people might feel different with 
one developing inside them. 
Some might not. I’m not saying I 
favor abortion. I’m just saying I 
don't know what I’d do since I’ve 
never been in the position to 
decide.

else will one find any mention of 
why possibly Dining Service does 
what it does. The authors seemed 
to assume that it was done only 
for their own personal annoy­
ance. (This applies mostly to the 
article “Toxic Swill” published in 
the Student Union. The article 
in the Tartan did make valid 
points and seemed to be of higher 
integrity than its counterpart.)
“Toxic Swill” seemed more of a 
forum for old useless one-liners 
than a serious newspaper article. 
It is all un-thoughtout non­
truths. Had the author taken the 
time to ask, maybe they would 
have had an eye-opener. One 
point was made about the lines 
at the Tartan Grill. During Din­
ing Service Orientation, Ms. 
Rochelle Koch explained to the 
new employees that the new line 
format is an attempt to speed up 
the service to the students. She 
admitted that she did not know if 
it would be practical, and said 
that they are testing it now. That 
asks another question, why
change? According to Ms. Koch, 
Dining Service had a problem 
last year with many students 
using the clutter and confusion 
of the lines to avoid paying for 
their food. (Makes Jack Benny 
look like a compulsive spender, 
doesn’t it?)
Also talked about was the sup­
posed “attitude” of the employ­
ees. Tartan and Kiltie food is my 
staple, and in all my times eating 
there, I have never had any cause 
to complain about the employees 
conduct, so I believe personally 
that the authors are unsubstan­
tiated in their conclusions. To 
paraphrase: I disagree with your 
conclusion that CMDS employ­
ees have an “attitude” problem.
Please, no one expects that you 
go to the Tartan manager and 
give him a hug and new cufflinks 
for his birthday, but try to under­
stand and appreciate the time 
and effort going into the food we 
eat.

quipped that the Cardinal’s lack 
of support for the city’s gay rights 
ordinance demonstrated that he 
had a civil rights orientation but 
did not practice it.
To suggest that blacks and 
women would not face discrimi­
nation if they conformed to the 
roles dictated by society, is to 
imply that the predetermined 
roles are not discrimination in 
and of themselves. For example, 
to design a curiculum or to write 
a law which permits the study of 
white culture, but forbids the 
study of black culture would be 
an inherently racist policy, even 
though, at least in theory, it 
applies to all equally. A similar 
example can be drawn with laws 
pertaining to homosexuality. A 
policy forbidding gays and lesbi­
ans (and heterosexuals) from 
showing any sign of homosexual­
ity, is a policy inherently based 
upon bigotry. Just as the previ­
ous example showed a policy 
suggesting that white culture was 
inherently more worthy than 
black culture, which subse­
quently implies that the experi­
ences of blacks are of less value 
than that of whites, the latter 
example suggests that homosexu­
ality is less worthy than hetero­
sexuality. That is, if blacks may 
be restricted in terms of studying 
and appreciating their culture 
where whites are not, this would 
clearly be racist. If gays and les­
bians may be restricted in terms 
of sharing love and affection with 
consenting partners where 
heterosexuals are not, this would 
also be bigotry.
Thus I return to my original 
conclusion. Despite the rhetoric, 
bigotry against homesexuals, not 
homosexuality itself, is the real 
issue. Grear and others should 
focus their attention towards 
dispelling the myths perpetuated 
by negative stereotypes and 
combatting bigotry. Giving cre­
dence to the bigot does indeed 
help to create complacency.

I guess I just think it’s wrong 
for a man in the White House to 
shuffle through some data and 
graphs about when a fetus devel­
ops brainwaves and toes to de­
cide for everyone when life be­
gins. Mr. Dukakis knows that it’s 
a decision no one can make, and 
that anyone who tries to make it 
is assuming an omnipotent, God­
like role in the lives of women 
and men. Our president can’t 
know everything and any candi­
date who claims to is frightening 
to imagine in office. I’d rather see 
a man in that role who realizes 
when federal law begins to tear 
at human rights — someone who 
knows that there are some deci­
sions one person, one president, 
just cannot make.

The Crucible is coming
By LAURA MCILRATH
Tartan Stciffwriter
The CMU drama department will be presenting The 
Crucible as their first mainstage play of the 1988-1989 
season beginning on October 19. The Crucible is perhaps 
Arthur Miller’s most popular work, and is required 
reading for a great many students in America. This is 
true not only because it is a masterful work of theater, 
but because of the light it sheds on the politics of America 
ill the time of two infamous trials—the Salem witch 
trials, and the McCarthy communist trials of'the 1950s.
The play is set in Massachusetts in the 1600s, and 
centers around an attempt by young girls to convince the 
community that there are witches among them. The 
judges believe them, and zealously prosecute supposed 
witches based on the girls' stories. What results is a 
hysteria in which all who oppose the prosecutingauthori-

Singin’ in the Rain (1952)
There isn’t another movie musical to hold a 
candle to this Gene Kelly classic - even if you’ve 
never seen it before, who hasn’t danced through 
puddles while whistlingthe unforgettable title song? 
The film is a delightful look inside the movie indus­
try, with two song-and-dance silent movie stuntmen 
(Kelly and Donald O’Connor) facing the humorous 
trials of Hollywood as it enters the sound era. It’s 
wonderfully funny and the musical numbers are 
spectacular, especially the energetic and skillful 
dancing from Kelly, O’Connor and Debbie Reynolds. 
Despite the strong challenge from Friday night’s 
movie, this has got to be our Bring-A-Date pick of the 
week. It’s worth the buck.

Here’s some food for thought. Steven Spielberg is 
the most successful man in Hollywood, bar none. 
He’s had his name on three of the top ten films of all 
time — Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T. — 
which gives him the relatively rare privilege of 
making any movie he wants to. In Batteries, he’s 
enlisted the considerable talent and century-plus 
combined experience of Hume Cronyn and Jessica 
Tandy as an elderly (no! really?) couple running a 
run-down diner. The diner and building are targeted 
for demolition by a developer - looks like trouble, but 
wait! A monkey wrench, in the form of miniature me­
chanical aliens, is thrown into the works. The film is 
funny, heartwarming and sweet, and the special 
effects are excellent and surprisingly subtle. A run­
ner-up for the Bring-A-Date pick of the week.

Mix Steve Martin and John Candy into a bizarre 
travelogue comic nightmare and stand back. These 
extraordinarily funny guys convincingly portray a 
man desperately trying to get home to his family for 
the holidays (Martin) and his jovial, friendly-to-a- 
fault and utterly repulsive travelling companion 
(Candy) going through some hilarious trials and 
tribulations. This film was a big hit in the theaters. 
Watch for Martin’s scene with a long-suffering air­

To Catch A Thief
Last month, it was Arnold; now, it’s Alfred. The 
Hitchcock Festival continues with Cary Grant as a 
retired jewel thief under suspicion of returning to his 
former occupation when a copycat begins to pinch 
pretties along the French Riviera. Grace Kelly also 
stars. The Hitchcock festival concludes next Sunday 
night with The Birds, and in November we have the 
Sunday SpaceOut with 2001, The Right Stuff and 
2010. Big fun.

For all the people who couldn’t 
afford to shell out twenty-odd 
bucks for Prince tix, take heart. 
Due to Pitt Program Coun­
cil and AB Concerts, you 
can see Fishbone, Billy 
Bragg, and Michelle 
Shocked this week for less 
than half of the Prince 
gouge.
Fishbone brings their 
hiphop funk groove thang 
(that’s spelled dance) to 
the Syria Mosque ballroom (that’s 
downstairs, where the Ramones 
played) Tuesday (that’s tonight) 
at 8:30 (that’s, oh, never mind). 
Tickets are normally $8.00, with 
Pitt students getting in for half 
price, but Pitt Program Council 
is nice enough to extend the dis­
count to anyone with a CMU id as 
well. (Pay $15,000, get in for half 
price - such a bargain.) Tickets
ets are available at the door or in 
the William Pitt Union building 
on Pitt campus (you know, a 
student union building - it’s a, 
well, it’s like, oh, never mind).
As for Billy Bragg and Michelle
Music Music Music 
In 
Review
Shocked, they’ll be at the Carne­
gie Music Hall on this Thursday, 
along with Weddings, Parties, 
Anything. Billy Bragg has been 
really het up about playing col­
lege campuses (campusi?) this 
election year, so he’s back with 
the same lineup as last spring. 
Bragg does the electrified folk/ 
rock thing, Shocked does the non- 
electrified folk/rock thing, and
Weddings, etc. does the beer rock 
thing, with an accordion even 
(kinda like an Australian ver­
sion of the Pogues), and if you 
want to know just what the hell 
all this shit is supposed to mean, 
you’ll just have to show 
up. Their last Pittsburgh 
show, at the Graffiti, was 
jammed (that’s jam- 
packed, as in “maybe I 
won’t try to dance after 
all”), and although the 
Carnegie Hall is a bit 
bigger, this show should 
be fairly crowded as well. 
(Unfortunately, the Carnegie has 
fixed and assigned seating, so 
dancing, or any movement, could 
be difficult.) The show starts at 
8:30, and the tickets are $4.00 if 
you get them at the Info Desk 
(with an id, again), or $8.00 if you 
don’t (It’s the old half-price stu­
dent fair again, oboy).

Special to the Tartan
Decorating the walls that 
surrounded a pile of pencils, a 
few ink sketches of buttocks, 
and a footprinted Add/Drop 
form, were David Knupp’s 
drawings. His studio reeked of 
oil media (paints and such), 
although he claims that his oil 
paintings have not yet passed 
the stage of experimentation 
and entered the realm of a 
complete body of work. Thus, 
his paintings will not be in­
cluded in the show.
But what his paintings lack 
as a body of work, his draw­
ings more than compen sate for. 
These life-sized portraits of 
individuals in Knupp’s life 
speak of human emotions and 
relationships with those sur­
rounding us.
The people depicted in
Knupp’s work are more than a 
means through which to study 
human anatomy (rightly so, since 
he has proved his understanding 
of the form in these drawings), 
but have significant personal 
value to Knupp; the drawings 
echo this emotion in their warm, 
atmospheric quality, as well as 
their depiction of subtly confus­
ing situations. For example, a 
shadowy, robed girl stands in a 
dim doorway as David sits in the 
sparse foreground, eyeing the 
viewer in self-contemplation.
Graphite and charcoal serve 
the function of describing 
Knupp’s characters and moods 
accurately and with great sophis­
tication ... what is seen as black 
and white is read emotionally as 
technicolor.
Like Knupp, Debbi Gibbon 
finds drawing an appropriate 
medium for describing human 
emotion. More specifically, Gib­
bon sees drawing as a direct way 
of making marks on a surface, 
whereas painting involves a 
wooden handle that contains a 
brush at its end, that dips into 
paintthatan artist (usually) does 
not directly apply with herhand. 
Gibbon’s drawings depict people 
because, she says, sheis“obsessed 
with them.” Drawing people, to 
Gibbon, shows concern for social 
situations.
Gibbon’s drawings analyze the 
figure by dissecting the surfaces 
of the form into smaller facets. 
They also show the process she 
undertook as she isolated each 
part of the form, leaving traces of 
charcoal behind to show where 
she has concentrated her efforts. 
An especially striking and pow­
erful image of Gibbon’s depicts a 
woman wearing a symbolic pen­
dant of some sort. The beauty of 
the drawing is in its rich colors, 
echoing the effect of stained glass
(a media whose result is ana­
lytical like Gibbon’s).
Lacey Goodrich was unavail­
able for comment, which as­
sures that she is busy at work,. 
preparing for her third of th e 
show. The opening reception ' 
will take place tonight from ,7- 
9 pm at The Forbes Gallery, 
5200 Forb.es Avenue, four 
nights after last week’s clos­
ing. Call the Gallery at x2081 
for more information.
Due to mid-semester break,, 
last week’s show could not be 
previewed, but rather, will he 
reviewed. Lori Harney and Jeff: 
Lesko exhibited serigrapKs 
(silk-screen) and relief (wood- 
cut) prints. Nathania Vish­
nevsky showed drawings that, 
ridiculed the media for their, 
abuse of women. The three 
juniors’ works displayed bold 
expression and differing indi 
vidual concerns.

The U.S. Air Force asked us to build a ground-based 
electro-optical deep space surveillance system that 
could identify an object the size of a soccer ball at 
22,300 miles in space. We did it, utilizing 3 telescopes 
and a large 4 computer system. Then they asked us to 
build four more system.sites. Quite an achievement, 
but it's just one example of TRW's impact on the future. 
TRW offers you the freedom to move among a wide

When I arrived at the Benedum 
pjr the last performance of Aida 
Sunday I found that it had 
ready sold out, and the one 
alper I saw had just run out of 
ckets. A sold-out Benedum 
enter meant a small Heinz Hall 
owd though, with the pleasant 
suit of being able to see the 
n >ncert from one of the best seats 
the house. Having been shut 
ut of Aida I thought I had es- 
iped depression for the after- 
jon'{Aida is one of those shows 
ithout a happy ending), but the 
SO program was almost as 
eighty.
Krzysztof Penderecki con- 
icted the orchestra in Sibelius’
Inlandia, the Schostakovich 
Iolin Concerto No. 2, and his 
¡m Symphony No. 2, a program 
ith a much darker mood than I 
ould have wished for on a mid- 
[i imester escapist trip to the 
mphony. Penderecki is known 
as a conductor than as a 
mposer, but achieved fairly 
nvincing results from the or- 
estra, especially in the perform- 
ice of his own symphony. With 
exception of Dutoit’s season 
lening concert, however, the 
fltlight so far this year has been 
oleri by outstanding soloists, 
ctor Tretyakov, Gold Medalist 
the Third International 
¡haikovsky Competition, con- 
lued the trend with a particu- 
rly Russian performance in the 
:hostakovich. A long double­
op passage in the first move- 
ent was impressive not only for 
virtuosic display, but for its 
usicality. Tretyakov’s interpre- 
tioii was always extremely 
dividual, while also conveying 
e composer’s original intent. 
Monday night was the first of 
is season’s “Steven Starkman 
Friends” concerts at Rodef 
lalom with an unusual program 
eluding the Bach D minor 
wednne for solo violin (per- 
rmed by Steven Starkman), the 
¡hubert Arpeggione Sonata
Ilward Gazouleas, viola), and 
e Dvorak Piano Quintet. The 
ayingfor the entire concert was 
very high level technically 
t unfortunately seemed to lack 
e artistic imagination that sets 
ly a few concert artists apart 
)m the rest. I thought that in 
¡rticular, Gazouleas’ reading of 
Schubert lacked the sponta- 
ity and character that, paired 
th his excellent technical flair, 
uld have made a truly special 
rformance. These particular 
rformers, by the simple fact 
at their primary energy is

Crucible opens soon

ties are suspect. This hysteria was mirrored in the United 
States government at the time of the play’s opening in the 
1950s, which is a major reason why the play had such an im­
pact. This sort of zealous and blind persecution is not some­
thing that we have left behind in our modern age, and that is 
why the play is such an important one even now.
The parallel between the Salem witch trials and McCarthy- 
ism has traditionally been accepted as the theme of the play, 
but in order to impress an audience in 1988, it will be necessary 
to touch on broader themes which are more relevant to modern 
society. David Henderson, the senior who designed set, is con­
vinced that the production will not be the traditional explora­
tion of the ’50s via the 1600s. “It’s a different approach—it’s 
definitely not going to be your normal Crucible.”
So for those who haven’t seen The Crucible, now’s your 
chance to see a play so influential that it is history itself. And 
for those who have seen it already, don’t think for a minute that 
you’ve seen all it can offer. Any play worth the paper it’s printed 
on must touch on some themes that are not bound by time or 
place, and The Crucible is not good, it’s great. This production 
promises to be innovative and to shed some new light on a play 
which is no more out of date in 1988 than it was on opening 
night in 1953.
The Crucible will be shown from October 19 through Novem­
ber 5 in the Kresge Theater. Tickets are available from the CFA 
box office; call 268-2407 for information.
It’s no big secret that the 
Diversions Staff Meetings are at 8 pm on

to Pittsburgh thousands of fine European vintage clothing 
items.
Avalon Vintage Clothing, a U.S. based company, has 
opened one of the largest vintage clothing and European 
military surplus fashion stores in the East. Being the fifth 
such store opened by owner operator Stuart McLean, it 
brings to Pittsburgh 25 years of combined experience in 
the American and European vintage clothing business, plus
numerous domestic and European military items that have 
been completely redesigned by some of America’s most 
creative designers.
4,000 garments from the 1940’s, 1950’s and 1960’s 
of both U.S. and European origins will be presented clean, 
pressed and ready to wear. Many of the European items 
have scarcely been sold in the U.S.A. whereas they are 
seen on the streets of every European capitol. All at 
prices you can afford without straining your pocketbook.

Scotch V Soda 
at Scotland Yard
By AMANDA COHEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Scotch ‘n’ Soda got their fall 
season started with a zoom last 
Wednesday. The non-dramat 
drama club’s first performance of 
the year was a brief comedy, 
“Requiem for a Dodo Bird,” writ­
ten by sophomore Javier Grillo- 
Marxuach and directed by Nancy 
Gleason. Scotland Yard hosted 
the event and even the blender 
drinks were put on hold for this 
show.
So with that first success be­
hind them already, Scotch ‘n’ 
Soda is looking forward to a busy, 
entertaining semester, beginning 
with their next production, a 
three-part soap-opera parody, 
written by Federico Hattoum, 
Javier Grillo-Marxuach, and 
Frank Schurter. It will be per­
formed in installments over the 
next six weeks.
All three shows will be per­
formed at Scotland Yard at 6:30 
pm on November 2,16, and 30.
For more information on pro­
ductions and workshops, check 
the bulletin board outside of Skibo 
40D, or call the Scotch ‘n’ Soda 
office at x3522.

Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Music celebrates its 75th 
anniversary this homecoming weekend with two free concerts 
showcasing students and distinguished alumni.
Friday evening at 8 pm the Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic 
and Chorus will perform at Carnegie Music Hall, Forbes Avenue 
in Oakland. Samuel Jones, newly appointed director of orches­
tral studies, will conduct Wagner’s Overture to Die Meistersingers, 
Handel’s Concerto Grosso in C (with the Cuarteto Latinoameri- 
cano as soloists), and Copland’s Suite from the Tender Land. 
Robert Page, Carnegie Mellon’s new director of choral studies, 
' will conduct Vaughan Williams’ Serenade to Music with eleven 
alumni vocal soloists, and the Bernstein Chichester Psalms.
The other concert is a “Jazz Spectacular” with performances 
by the Carnegie Mellon Jazz Ensemble (Randy Purcell, direc­
tor), the Carnegie Mellon Jazz Choir (Mark Burnell, director), 
and a jam session including Joe Negri, Randy Purcell, Jack 
Purcell and other music department alumni. That performance 
starts at 1:30 and will take place in the Gymnasium.
Both performances, according to Acting Department Head Dr. 
Marilyn Thomas, are intended to show the best that Carnegie 
Mellon has to offer. That a quality education in music is and has 
been available is obvious, by the alumni who have been mem­
bers in virtually every major symphony in the country and by 
the talented representatives at the tops of other fields of music.

Knechtle says that he 
will just say “I don’t 
know” when he does 
not have the answer.
over the years, replacing them with a 
nihilistic reliance on self.
Belief in the existence of God provides 
Knechtle with the basis for his entire 
value system. Without a belief in God, 
says Knechtle, he would be a “nilhilist or 
a hedonist,” citing the philosophies of 
denial of all moral judgements and pleas­
ure seeking.
In his endeavors to convert the cam­
pus, Knechtle quotes many important 
authors and philosophers, including 
H.G. Wells, Descartes, and Aristotle. 
Knechtle admits that he is not an intel­
lectual, and needs to read and memorize 
parts of books for his campus works.
He will admit that there have been 
times when students have stumped him. 
Knechtle says that he will just say “I 
don’t know” when he does not have the 
answer. However, his use of that phrase 
has decreased considerably with his 10- 
year experience on campuses around 
the country.
Knechtle is married and has two young 
children. He is a graduate of Davidson 
College in North Carolina and Gordon- 
Conwell Theological Seminary in Mas­
sachusetts. He was ordained as a Bap­
tist minister, but spends most of his 
time travelling around college campuses 
and speaking to students about his faith. 
InterVarsity Christian Fellowship 
(IVCF) brought him to Carnegie Mellon.
There are students on campus that 
say that Knechtle’s ability to answer 
questions comes more from his ability to 
dodge the real question and reply with a 
general answer. Both in person and when 
speaking, Knechtle comes off as a very 
personable, yet very rehearsed, person­
ality. Answers to questions in inter­
views, as well as in public, are often 
ended with a polished smile and a 
“Thanks for asking that.”
Cliffe explains his personal motives
My friends in high school had 
anything they wanted. If one of 
the guys I played sports with 
wanted sex, they found a girl to 
go to bed with. If they wanted a 
new car, they bought it. If they 
wanted to go swimming, they 
simply stepped out to the pool 
in their back yard. One friend 
was the son of an executive vice 
president of an insurance corpo­
ration in Manhattan. But 
despite all of his wealth, he 
jumped off the Golden Gate 
Bridge in San Francisco 
screaming, “I’m free, I’m free.” 
Another high school friend 
was the son of an executive vice 
president of a New York bank.
All of his possessions and expe­
riences did him little good when 
his body was wheeled into the 
morgue. He died of a drug 
overdose.
Maybe you can see why I grew 
to hate sin so much. I’m not 
against having a good time. But 
I care for my friends and my 
family. And I will do whatever 
I can to keep such unnecessary 
pain out of their lives. My 
friends had it all — all except a 
deep relationship with the liv­
ing God.

that Satisfies My Heart and 
Mind by Cliffe Knechtle

ized form. I guess it’s fine on an 
individual level though.” 
“Define religion. Hmm. I don’t 
think religion is a synonym for 
faith or beliefs. They are the 
things that really matter.” 
“Everyone wonders and hopes 
that there is a God. Why wouldn’t 
they? If there is no God then 
what’s the point.”
Regardless of what an 
individual’s opinion is, religion is 
a loaded word. It is not usually a 
desireable topic for dinner con­
versation. Many people become 
uncomfortable or violent when
asked to discuss it. In reality, 
very few people actually under­
stand religion, and even fewer 
incorporate a specific belief into 
their everyday lives. Religion 
sparks controversy, raises ques­
tions, and often leads to frustra­
tion.
Most students admit that 
they’re unsure about what to 
believe. “I think most people 
wonder if there is a God and if 
what they believe is right or 
wrong, whether they want to 
admit it or not,” one student said. 
“Why do people have consciences
anyway?”
Another student agreed. “Well, 
I think that most people here 
probably feel that a higher force 
exists, but they are either afraid 
or unable to define it.”
Several students claimed that 
they simply do not have time to 
ponder the existence of God or 
the place of religion in society, 
and that it’s really a question of 
priorities. “I think most people 
are unsure, but too caught up in 
their work to care,” said one. 
Other students admitted that

Knechtle addresses

Questioners ranged from angry people 
hurling insults or arguments against 
the existence of God to students asking 
for clarifications on the finer points of 
Biblical parables. The more fiery ex­
changes took place during the day by the 
clock on the Cut, while a calmer, less 
hostile audience filled Doherty Hall 2210 
for the evening session Thursday.
Knechtle says the main argument he 
tries to communicate is that people 
should apply the same skepticism to­

SAMS enters fourth year of charity at CMU
By CATHERINE LO MONICO
Tartan Assistant Features Editor
Students against Multiple Sclerosis 
(SAMS) is starting its fourth year at 
Carnegie Mellon with plans to regain 
the support it has had in the past as well 
as build up the student 
organization to what it was 
when it was first started.
Faramarz “Mouse”
Shargh, a ThetaXi brother, 
started the CMU branch 
of SAMS in 1985 and made 
it one of the most school 
spirited clubs on campus.
In its first year, between 
SAMS and ThetaXi, CMU 
raised $25,000, placingthe 
campus first in the MTV/MS contest 
and winning us a free Bangles concert at 
the Syria Mosque. To raise the money 
fraternities held fundraising parties, 
money was donated from the Greek Sing 
contest, and SAMS held its first annual
fundraising events. The winning band 
from Rock-A-Like went on to the nation­
als on MTV and eventually made it to 
the semi-finals.
In its first year of fundraising for MS, 
CMU had more than just the motivation 
to win a free concert or get MTV cover­
age of a lip-synch band. 
ATO brother Rich Miller 
contracted MS while he was 
a student at CMU and 
during SAMS’ first year 
acted as a speaker for the 
organization. “He was a 
reminder of the effects of 
the disease, and brought 
this problem closer to home
- it was a real incentive,” 
said senior Lauren How­
ard, who was an prominent member in 
SAMS.
Last year, SAMS was headed by Kris 
Stringer, who coordinated fundraising 
events on campus all year long. The 
Balloon Launch started off the year with
round trip airplane tickets.
At a home football game the 
winners were announced and 
the balloons were launched.
During the year, SAMS held 
its second annual Rock-A- 
Like contest, had a 
Valentine’s raffle to give away 
dinners for two at area res­
taurants and two round trip ----------------
tickets to Florida, UDS do- 
nated $0.25 for every large soda sold at 
the Tartan Grill, and DTD, Pika and 
ATO each held a fundraising party.
Excluding money raised by Theta Xi, 
SAMS raised $4000 last year, a large 
part of which was donated by the frater­
nities. However, after the LCB bust CMU 
saw the last of some of its largest fun­
draising events. DTD’s Postman party 
raised $1200, Pika donated $400 and 
ATO raised $400, all of which was given 
to SAMS except the bulk of Pika’s which 
was confiscated by the LCB and never 
returned.
Rock-A-Like contest along with other a raffle for a VCR, a CD player and 2 “The fraternities were more than will-
“The fraternities were more than 
willing to help us, but now I 
wouldn't even dare ask anyone to 
throw a party for MS."

ing to help us, but now I wouldn’t even 
dare ask anyone to throw a party for MS. 
MS has suffered a loss of donations in 
the long run because of the bust,” said 
Stringer. Fraternity fundraisers had 
been a long-time tradition and were the 
source of a greater part of the donations 
received. According to Stringer, Colleen 
McGuire from the Pittsburgh division of 
MS and Ed Kaye from National MS 
were both aware of the parties and knew 
the money they received was from dona­
tions given at the parties.
This year, SAMS is being run by so­
phomores Cheryl Shapiro and Elizabeth
Bailey. With the excepti0 
of fraternity parties, they w 
be coordinating similar 
draising events as well i 
many new ones. In hopes 
getting more supporters ft 
the organization, they \vj 
be starting off the year b 
raffling off more dinnei

purchase of a ticket.
Theta Xi is starting its fundraisin 
with Basket Bucks, a one day basketba 
tournament to raise money for MS. T1 
16 teams will be composed of campi 
organizations, and the team that rais 
the most money will get an exhibits 
game with the WDVE All-stars. Baski 
Bucks is being backed by Richard Cye 
and Pittsburgh MS, and it will be hel 
November 19.
SAMS needs student support in it 
upcoming fundraisers and welcomes a 
CMU students to come to its meeting 
on Mondays at 4:30 in Scotland Yard.
Easy ways to impress dinner guests
You’re walking on air when you 
get home from classes. You just 
asked that cute guy/gal over for 
dinner tomorrow night, and he/ 
she said yes! You’re so happy, 
that as you toast your afternoon 
Pop-tart, that you do not realize 
what you have done until the 
toaster pops up. You really want 
to impress your dinner guest, but 
you work late tomorrow and won’t 
have time to cook anything com­
plicated.
Luckily, some easy, fast dishes 
don’t seem easy or fast.
Fish with Mustard Sauce 
Mix equal amounts of mustard 
(Grey Poupon or Guldens work 
equally well) and mayonnaise. 
Spoon onto one side of sole or cod 
fillets and broil for about five 
minutes.
Spinach Lasagna 
You can’t taste the spinach (I 
have friends who hate spinach 
but love this lasagna), really! The 
main benefit of working with 
spinach instead of meat is that 
browning the meat means deal­
ing with grease. You need: 1 
package lasagna noodles, 1 pack­
age grated mozzarella cheese, 1
32-oz tub ricotta cheese, 1 pack­
age frozen chopped spinach (leaf 
spinach is too stringy), 3 cloves 
garlic, minced spices to taste 
(basil, oregano, thyme, black 
pepper, rosemary, nutmeg), 132- 
oz jar spaghetti sauce, 1 large 
loaf or baking pan, and 1/4 cup 
chopped walnuts (if desired).
Thaw the spinach (if you don’t 
have access to a microwave, leave 
the whole package unwrapped in 
a bowl of hot water in the morn­
ing. It will be ready when you get 
home). Boil the noodles in a large 
pot (I specify large so that they 
don’t get clumped together). 
Drain them and arrange them on 
a plate. Separate them into 
noodles that broke while boiling 
and noodles that didn’t. Use the 
noodles that broke for lower lay-

Wnslo( s3iosme mo The Tartan
By BRYAN THOMAS SCHMIDT
Tartan Staffwriter
“I’m the same person in real life as I am on the 
air,” jokes Edye Tarbox. “I really think that’s 
the only way to describe me. It’s the easiest. I 
watch myself when I’m out in public, but I still 
do the things I think are fun. I’m in my 20s, and 
I’m enjoying life.”
Tarbox grew up in Chicago but moved to 
Texas with her family when she was a freshman 
in High School. She says she decided to go into 
journalism when she was 15 years old and went 
to the University of Texas for a degree in Broad­
cast Journalism.
Her freshman year she 
worked as a DJ for a punk rock 
radio station. As a sophomore, 
she worked for the USA Film 
Festival. “My junior year I 
started in TV. I got a job for the 
summer in San Antonio, Texas 
and that was where I really got 
my feet wet. They sent me out 
reporting, writing stories, doing 
everything. After doing that I 
realized this is exactly what I 
want to do.”
The next year she worked for 
NBC in Austin, where she was 
attending school. After gradu­
ating, she went out and started 
auditioning and interviewing.
“I guess you do it the way eve­
rybody else does any other job,” 
she explains. “You hopefully try 
to gain some practical experi­
ence in college, and then you go 
on to pursue that right out of 
college.” She found work at a 
CBS affiliate in Duluth, Min­
nesota, and it was there that 
she got her “big break.”
“My first big break was about 
three months after I started 
working my first job out of col­
lege,” she says. “I was covering 
a snowmobile rally in upper 
Wisconsin right near the Michi­
gan border. The snowmobiles 
had CBs, and all of a sudden I 
heard an emergency call come 
out over the CB saying that 
someone had been killed at a 
nearby ski area.” Tarbox was five minutes away, 
with no nearby airport, an accident involving a 
lot of injuries and one “really gross death.” CBS 
was desperate to get someone in, so Tarbox was 
assigned to do the report, fly to Chicago, and 
feed it in for Dan Rather’s Evening News. “Some­
thing had malfunctioned with the ski lift opera­
tion equipment,” Tarbox says. “The ski lift 
operator had been severed in half and about a 
hundred people had been knocked off the ski lift 
when his body got caught in the machine.”
“It’s a gross way to get your first break,” she 
continues,’’but after they saw the story, they 
called up and said they thought it was good.” 
Tarbox was asked to send in any other stories 
she did which might have national appeal. “They 
turned out liking my material so I developed a 
good relationship with them,” she says.
After leaving 
Duluth and 
working four 
more jobs—two 
anchor posi­
tions, one as a 
VJ for MTV, and 
the other report­
ing — Tarbox 
ended up in 
Pittsburgh.
“Pittsburgh just 
happened to be 
one of the places 
I was offered a job,” she comments, “and it 
turned out that this was the job that I wanted.”
According to Tarbox, being an anchorperson 
is serious work. “I chew a lot of bubble gum,” she 
kids as she throws hers in the garbage can. “I 
get in between 2:30 and 3:30 everyday, check 
my mail, read the paper, type up my radio 
report for Y97 — I do a radio cut-in at 4:15 every 
day for Magic 97 — and take a look at the 
weather report. So I kind of get a grasp as soon 
as I get in on what the day’s news is,” she 
explains. “I do my radio report, then after that
— between 3 and 5 is normal — I start typing 
the stories that I work on for the 6 o’clock news. 
I write those and then put on makeup at 5:15 or 
5:45.” She and Hambrick trade off for the 5:45 
cut-in to the 5:30 First Edition announcing 
what will be featured on the news at 6.
“Someone rips the scripts,” she continues, 
“and I start going through them and changing 
things that I want to change. The difference 
between print and broadcast is that I try to 
make it as conversational as possible. My main 
job is to take what things other people write, to 
make them understandable, to make them tal- 
kable, and then go out and communicate them.”
The news director decides the order in which 
stories are presented and who will read them. 
Usually the stories are evenly divided and Ham-
V _________________
brick and Tarbox each read half of the news. 
Stories that are similar are kept together — ac­
cidents, murders, politics.
“I believe that good stories are stories that 
help people lead better lives, more informed 
lives, or more productive lives,” Tarbox says. 
“That’s what I think the purpose of news is — to 
help people function in their community and 
make their community better.”
“I feel that newscasters, like everyone else 
who’s in the public eye, have the responsibility 
of being good leaders for their community,” she 
continues. “I feel that people who have positions 
in the community that let them be more visible
than others have an inherent responsibility to 
be as good as they can. Nobody’s perfect, but I 
really feel that people in positions to make a 
difference should and should make a positive 
difference.”
Tarbox, in spite of her ever busy schedule, 
still manages to find time for pursuing personal 
interests. “In the mornings I do different things. 
Sometimes I’m involved in Junior League. I’m 
also involved in The Women’s Symphony 
League,” she says. “A lot of times I go out and 
talk to schools or I go to luncheons or fashion 
shows.”
“Quite honestly,” Tarbox admits with a some­
what embarrassed smile,” I watch Happy Trails 
Theatre about four days a week.” She claims to 
be a Western movie fanatic, watching the Roy 
Rogers and Gene Autry movies. “I’m a fanatic 
for them.”
Tarbox’s hob­
bies include 
fishing, water 
and snow 
skiing, and sew­
ing. “I sew most 
of my own 
clothes,” she 
says. She enjoys 
dancing, base­
ball, hockey, 
and watching 
football.
On Friday nights after work she goes club 
hopping, often ending up at her favorite club, 
Metropol, where she might occasionally stop for 
her favorite drink. “I’m a margarita fanatic,” 
she claims.
Tarbox has also made a reputation for herself 
as a practical joker. She says her favorite was 
the one she pulled on coanchor Mike Hambrick 
during last year’s water shortage. On WDVE 
with Scott Paulsen at 7 am, she called and woke 
up Hambrick, who at that point had had only 3 
hours’ sleep, claiming to be a member of an 
activist group concerned about the water prob­
lem. She said several of Hambrick’s neighbors 
had complained of his family’s excessive use of 
water, and asked if he would mind doubling up 
with his family when taking showers so that 
some of the neighbors without water could 
borrow his shower.- “He didn’t think that was 
very funny for a long time,” she admits.
In spite of the joke, Hambrick thinks very 
highly of his coanchor. “She’s bright, talented, 
curious, dedicated, and committed. She’s a good 
person.”
Among her plans, Tarbox is getting married 
in April to a man she was set up with on a blind 
date by the vice president of MTV. “I don’t 
know,” she says. “I’ve pushed the date back

By STEVE PETERS
Tartan Staffwriter
On October 10 the Pittsburgh 
Society for American-Soviet 
Friendship hosted a group of 
Soviet citizens on a goodwill tour 
sponsored by the Soviet Friend­
ship Society in the USSR. The 
Soviets were in Pittsburgh on a 
brief 10 day tour of the North­
eastern United States. Dave 
Markley and I met with the tour 
while they were attending a re­
ception in the basement of a Lu­
theran Church in Brentwood.
The group was composed of pro­
fessors, doctors, and high rank­
ing politicians.The average age 
was around forty years old, only 
one person was under thirty, and 
only a few spoke English. It was 
clear that they considered it a 
privilege to travel to the United 
States.
The first person I spoke with 
was Yuri Volkov, a leading So­
viet professor of Sociology and 
Head Chair of the Social Plan­
ning Higher Trade Union School 
in Moscow. Mr. Volkov is also a 
member of the Soviet Sociologi­
cal Association Presidium. I had 
feared that we and the Soviets 
were being closely watched. 
However, Yuri dispelled these 
fears, by following Dave and me 
upstairs away from the group to 
escape the noise.
Tartan: Many students are 
concerned about how well Gor­
bachev is received within the 
Soviet Union.
Yuri: I think our people are a 
very differen| strata. The most 
active and vivid members of our 
population support perestroika, 
and support the ideas and meas­
ures of Gorbachev. Some are 
against them because they con­
sist of party bureaucracy. Our 
whole bureaucracy is losing its 
power. Some of the working 
people are against them because 
now with the new system it is 
necessary to- work more effec­
tively, harder. There is a part of 
our working people that believe 
reform to work is bad, they be­
lieve it is effective enough to get 
minimal wages. The masses do
not understand this sense, the 
essence of perestroika, that is my 
opinion on this question.
Tartan: Many people in the US 
are happy to see Gorbachev 
making reforms because they see 
our two countries growing closer. 
However, many people don’t see 
that Gorbachev will be in power 
very long, because he is so new 
and so radical. Doyou think this 
will happen, thawie will fade 
away?
Yuri: Therejtre pebble in your 
country thlt think so? I hope
successful^ I hope. Bu^ in the 
social processes it is impossible 
to give an exact prognosis, how 
this or that process will go. There 
are always various possibilities. 
He maybe successful, or maybe 
not. If he is not, it will be very bad 
for our country, for our people, 
and for international irglations. 
But it is very important'to help 
Gorbachev and the party now to 
promote growth and re: 
toward success.
Tartan: Is your trip to Americi 
fcheresulfcof Gorbachev’s reforms'
Yum No, our people, our men 
arid women could visit America 
formerly. I myself visited here 
seven or eight years ago. It was 
very hard, very difficult and there 
was fear. At that time our rela­
tions were bad, but it was pos­
sible. I think that these possibili- j 
ties became more broadened, it ia 
very well. Our people visit ^our 
country and Americans visit our 
country. It is very important to 
our future.
Tartan: Have you had much 
chance to meet and speak with 
Americans face to face?
Yuri: Vei^time time. The trip 
is a ten day visit,five cities with­
out flying. There is little time for 
meetings and conversation. They 
are very interesting and useful. I 
would like to have more time for 
meeting formal or informal.
Tartan: Have you been follow­
ing the Presidential elections?
Yuri: It is impossible to fore­
cast, it is impossible. I think that 
American politics and sociologists 
could not forecast the results of 
your elections. Maybe I think that
Dukakis will win. I think but, 
nobody can tell.
Tartan: If you could vote in the 
Presidential elections, who would 
you vote for?
Yuri: I would vote for Dukakis.
Tartan: Why?
Yuri: Why? Bush is anti-com­
munist. In international relations 
he suggests that the US continue 
dialog with the Soviet Union from 
a power position. I don’t know if 
this is the right way.
Tartan: If I could visit Russia, 
where should I go?
Yuri: I don’t know exactly. 
Come, come to our country, you 
would see, you can speak with 
young men and girls. You would 
make friends in our country. 
Come.
Later that night I spoke with 
Alexi Romanov, a lively TV and 
radio reporter from Yaroslavl 
City.
Tartan: Have your expectations 
of America come true?
I Alexi: I feel a bit unreal. I feel 
I'm in an American movie. I’ve 
seen so many. Our people are 
very similar, very similar. They 
have the same nature as we have 
in Russia. The same interests, 
perhaps, the same troubles.
Tartan: Have you met Ameri­
cans before?
Alexi: Yes, I am a member of an 
international friendship club and 
have rriet American people. I also 
havefriends in Massachusets and 
Texas. They come every summer 
and meet at my place.
, Tartan: You’ve had a lot of 
Jlxperience then.
J Alexi: Yes. Americans are two 
separate things. They are senti­
mental and practical. Americans 
resemble Russians in many ways. 
They are both as open and both 
emotional, a bit like children. I’ve 
never had any problems under­
standing Americans on a personal 
level. We always have fun to­
gether.
Tartan: What’s your radio show 
like?
Alexi: It’s a 40 minute radio 
magazine for young people, dis­
cussions, reports, music. I try to 
make it as interesting as possible

ECE grad students help recycle cans
By KHRISTINA MAYES
Tartan Staffwriter
Did you ever notice those 
funny little boxes by the pop 
machines as you walked 
through the corridors of Por­
ter or Hamerschlag Hall — 
those little boxes that can be 
found all over campus in odd, 
dark corners? You know, the 
ones that have “For Cans Only: 
CMU Re'lsycling” printed in 
magic marker on the side.' If 
you happen to be awake and
paying attention to the world 
when you pass these boxes, you 
may wonder to yourself, “Just 
what in the world is CMU recy­
cling, anyhow?”
CMU recycling is a student- 
organized operation handled by 
a group of graduate students. 
Once every month or so, the cans 
are all rounded up for recycling.
Unfortunately, CMU makes a 
negative profit. It seems that the 
cost of recycling the cans is 
greater than the number of cans 
being recycled. Thus, CMU recy­
cling is operatingin the red. If 
it ever turns a profit, though, 
the money will go to ECE, the 
Electrical and Computer En­
gineering Department, since 
CMU recycling is a project run 
by the grad students of that 
department.
So, the next time you’re 
getting that caffeine boost 
before an early morning class, 
remember to toss your empty 
can into the funny little box in 
the corner. After all, it’s for a 
good cause.

Homecoming at Carnegie Mel­
lon this year will be highlighted 
by the 75th anniversary of the 
Music Department. The Music 
Department theme will carry 
over the entire weekend. Friday 
evening will begin with “An 
Evening of Music at Carnegie 
Music Hall” where an annual 
alumni dinner will be followed by 
a concert performed by the Car­
negie Mellon Philharmonic and 
Concert Choir. Other special 
musical events include the Mu­
sic Alumni Brunch and A Jazz 
Spectacular featuring the Car­
negie Mellon Jazz Ensemble and 
The Jazz Choir which will ap­
pear on Saturday.
Traditionally, Homecoming is 
a time that is shared by students 
and alumni. This year, however, 
the absence of Tech Field will 
create certain changes in the 
overall atmosphere. During the 
season, the shift of football games 
off of campus has not been much 
of a problem for Tartan fans and 
attendance has remained con­
stant. But with the arrival of
alumni from 
around the coun­
try, there is the 
potential for much 
confusion and 
some disappoint­
ment. Many of the 
older alumni may 
remain on campus 
instead of travel- 
ing to Mt. Lebanon.
According to Tamara Hale, 
Associate Director of Alumni 
Relations, this problem results 
more from mobility difficulties 
than from lack of enthusiasm on 
the part of the alumni. “These 
are, after all, the same players 
who beat Notre Dame in their 
time,” she commented. Alumni 
Relations is providing directions 
for alumni who wish to drive to 
Mt. Lebanon, and bus transpor­
tation will leave from Skibo.
In addition to the changes 
surrounding the Homecoming 
football game, more active en­
forcement of Pennsylvania liq­
uor laws will also cause a few 
alterations. Certain events which 
have been previously open to 
students will not be this year 
because alcohol is will be served.
Homecoming is a time that is 
shared by students and alumni. 
This year, the absence of Tech 
Field will create certain changes 
in the overall atmosphere.
Several new events have been 
added to the Homecoming calen­
dar this year. The additional 
activities are a result, at least in 
part, from the increased interest 
taken in Homecoming by such 
campus organizations as the 
Activities Board (AB), Student 
Dormitory Council (SDC), Stu­
dent Senate, and the Enthusi­
asm Club. Two new events are 
the Gateway Clipper Dance 
Cruise, sponsored by the SDC, 
and the First Annual Homecom­
ing Dance. This will feature The 
Flow by the fence, sponsored by 
AB. “One reason for these activi­
ties is to make sure that the 
students who aren’t affiliated 
with fraternities and sororities 
have things to do during Home­
coming,” commented Gina Mar­
sala, AB Coffeehouse Chairman.

Ask Specs
by Sara Flynn
V
ear Rick,
It’s wonderful to hear of such a 
fondness for food. I was unable to 
get the secret recipe from the 
iltie kitchen, but try my esti­
mation:
! 1 egg
| 68 pounds of lentils 
| 18 pounds of Crisco
1 44 pounds of carrots and/or 
cabbage 
! 1 cup of ice water
I Blend in a food processor until 
tne mixture forms a ball. Chill 
the dough, flour lightly, and wrap 
in cheese cloth for one hour. Bake 
ofr the lower rack of a preheated 
4)00° oven for 40 minutes and 
then serve.
II would recommend either a 
Flinot Noir or the new fashion­
able Hungarian wine, Tokay.
This wine comes from the vine­
yards of the mountains that di­
vide Hungary and Czechoslova­
kia, it has a delicate flavor that 
enhances the subtleties of len­
tils.
Bon Appetit.
—Specs
Dear Specs,
I am having a Hawaiian Luau 
after the Presidential Election. 
Any thoughts on what to serve 
and how much to make? I also 
don’t know how much alcohol to 
buy.
—Help!
Dear Help,
What you serve depends on 
what you want to accomplish. 
There are those who seem to think 
it is de rigeur to drink 2-3 gallons 
of beer during the evening. You
can either satisfy them and pre­
pare for the poorhouse, or give 
directions to University Bever­
age Service. Others demand cock­
tails.
Serving cocktails can be quite 
tricky. Unless your guests are all 
over 21 you could spend the night 
entertaining the LCB. If your 
legal age guests get caught driv­
ing after a few, you might spend 
the next few years at a correc­
tional facility. The first thing to 
do is to reevaluate the guest list. 
This will probably makes your 
party an intimate few.
If you would like the evening to 
result in nausea, serve tropical 
drinks. Inevitably, they will be 
too strong. You will find yourself 
hoping that your guests will be 
sick in the bathroom, without 
ruining your handtowels. Con­
sider the other options.
Gin drinks are really only re­
freshing in the summer. Scotches, 
whiskeys and brandies stain 
terribly. It’s better not to take 
the chance of ruining your 
clothes, upholstery, drapes etc. 
This leaves the question “To wine, 
or not to wine?” If you say yes, 
prepare yourself for: whites with
fish, reds with meat, burgundy, 
Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon, 
Chardonnay, Chablis or - the 
latest in Vogue - Zinfandel. Wine 
is really too complicated to be 
practical.
Here is the best solution: buy 
Noilly Prat Dry Vermouth. The 
aroma enhances the palette, the 
color is unoffensively clear, the 
alcohol content is low and the 
flavor is awful. Vaguely reminis­
cent of NyQuil, few will finish 
even their first drinks. This not 
only minimizes clean-up, but also 
rids you of the dangers of drunks. 
Your friends will not become 
lecherous, loud, disorderly, slur- 
rish, or sick, and you will gain a 
unique reputation as host(ess). 
After the party you can use the 
leftover vermouth to clean the 
oven.

Dear Specs,
If a man takes a girl to lunch 
should he pick up the check?
—Chivalry
Dear Chiv,
Go dutch if you go to Tartan, 
Morewood, Salads or MorePizza.
She might not have a meal plan, 
but since you can order a la carte 
the price is controlled by the 
consumer. She’ll eat what she 
pays for and vice versa.
If you suggest the Kiltie, be 
prepared to pick her meal up on 
your validine account. The com­
bination of her love for you and a 
hearty meal might not extend to 
$4.20. However, if she hesitates 
at the Kiltie (i.e. “I don’t like 
today’s entree Monterey Jack 
Cheese Bake.”) desist immedi­
ately. Don’t go all the way; in­
stead, head for Scotland Yard. It 
has a lovely mood you will both 
appreciate and the service will 
give you something to remark 
upon.

Dear Specs,
I’m a junior girl. What is best 
for me to date: an older man, or a 
younger one? I want to have a 
relationship without all the 
hassle of dating, acting domes­
tic, etc.
—Need Advice
Dear Need,
Freshman boys make lots of
noise
And sophomore ones often 
slump.
Junior guys have wandering 
eyes
Which makes them give you 
the bump.
But, senior dudes have ro­
mantic moods

total calories, the salt intake 
should be no more than 3300g.
Good nutrition means good food 
and good health. Eat a variety of 
foods, maintain a desirable 
weight by sensible eating and
healthy, and energetic. Read on 
to learn more about basic nutri­
tion and how to keep nutrition­
ally fit here at Carnegie Mellon.
Everyone needs the basics: wa­
ter, protein, carbohydrates, fats, 
vitamins, and minerals. Most of 
what we eat provides the basic 
food groups in some combination 
or another. However, when you 
skip meals, grab “fast food,” or 
overload in any one area, this is 
where you run the risk of little or 
no nutrition.
The question I’m often asked 
is, “how much of the basic food 
groups do I need and how do I get 
them on CMU’s campus”. An easy 
formula to remember is 2-2-4-4. 
Two servings from the milk/meat/ 
protein group and four from the 
bread/cereal/fruit and vegetable 
group. Since no single diet or 
type of food gives you all the 
nutrients you need, choose from 
a wide variety of foods. Remem­
ber, variety is the spice of life, 
and the key to good nutrition. 
Choosing to eat right so you can 
be productive is essential to sur­
vival on campus. The following 
are examples of what is consid­
ered good for you here:
Morewood: milk, juice, bagels, 
yogurt, salad bar, soup.
Tartan Grill: bagels, fruit, 
juice, milk, salads, breakfast eggs 
and toast.
Salads Plus: soup, breads, 
tuna and chicken salad, juice, 
fruit, yogurt.
Margaret Morrison Deli:
dried fruits, fresh fruits, seltzer, 
I milk, fresh luncheon meats, 
chicken, turkey, lean roast beef 
(stay away from the processed 
meats).
Kiltie: salads, main entrees 
without cheese, sauces, or gra­
vies; potatoes, fruit, milk, soup.
To keep your mealtime inter­
esting, choose a variety of eating 
places on campus; this will stop 
boredom.
“Calories are calories” is one of 
the biggest myths. The calories 
in french fries and equal amounts 
of a baked potato are similar in.

very differently. Most of the calo-

twice, but now I’m supposed to be 
getting married in April.”
What does Tarbox look for in 
men? “Intelligence is definitely 
number one,” she says. “High 
morals. Not ‘born again Chris­
tian morals,’ but I mean honest, 
fair,' unprejudiced. I consider 
those kinds of things morals, too. 
It also helps to look like David 
Letterman,” she laughs, explain­
ing that her fiance has a big gap 
between his front teeth and 
“terrible hair.”
Tarbox plans to work at WPXI 
for a couple more years, then 
move to New York to be with her 
husband, whose job there won’t 
allow him to leave the city very 
often. “We want to start a fam­
ily,” she says. “It’s preferable to 
be in the same setting, but it’s 
not going to be for a long time.” In 
the meantime, they plan to com­
mute and spend as much time 
together as possible. “We’ve been 
commuting for a year,” Tarbox 
explains,’’and it works out okay. 
I’m under contract here, and I’d 
just as soon be in Pittsburgh.” 
Tarbox enjoys her job at WPXI 
because of the people she gets to 
work with. “No matter what job 
they have, most people could find 
some jerks that they have to work 
with or bosses they can’t stand,” 
she explains. “I’ve been really 
fortunate in this stage because 
I’ve got a boss I think is a genius. 
I respect him a hundred percent. 
I could have gone to a bigger 
station. The one thing that 
brought me here is the great 
people I get to work with.” 
Tarbox claims the members of 
the WPXI news team always have 
a good time. “Especially at night,” 
she says. “I love teasing Mike on 
the set, and I love getting Sam 
INover, the sports anchor], just 
really getting Sam good. We have 
great parties, too. Our Hallow­
een party last year was terrific. 
That, on a personal side, is what 
I like about the station.”
Tarbox says her most embar­
rassing moment at the station 
occurred during the first couple 
broadcasts of the evening traffic 
report done on the news by Carol 
Finelli. “The first three days she 
did it, she did something really 
funky with her voice and just like 
started giggling at the end,” the 
anchor says with a smile. “The 
first time she did it none of us 
were prepared for it, and I had to 
read the next introduction for a 
story. Sam just breaks out laugh­
ing and he turns away, and Mike’s 
laughing, and I’m just losing it. 
And it’s a story my first words 
out are: ‘Dead seals are found

parties, too. Our 
Halloween party 
last year was ter­
rific.”

near Norway.’ It was like three 
really serious stories right off the 
bat, and I was crying. I just kept 
on laughing through it. I got in 
big trouble for that.”
With all the craziness does she 
have any regrets? “None, not a 
bit,” she states firmly. “I feel I’ve 
been very fortunate. I’ve been 
very lucky, and luck has a lot to 
do with this business. You hap­
pen to be in the right place at the 
right time.”
Tarbox is pleased with her life 
and is looking forward to the 
future. “I feel that I live the way 
that’s most comfortable for me,” 
she notes. “I live with a feeling 
that I’ve done as much as I possi­
bly can, and I’ve enjoyed it while 
I’m doing it. I don’t think there’s 
any sense in running yourself 
ragged trying to be something 
you aren’t; to try to make it 
someplace that you think you 
should be, and then getting there 
and finding out that you’ve lost a 
lot of time and a lot of opportuni­
ties along the way. I try to be the 
type of person that I can be proud 
of — the kind that I think is 
helping to change the world, or 
my community, at least. And I 
feel like I’m continuing to prog­
ress in the direction that I want 
to be.”

for my audience.
Tartan: Have you heard what 
young Americans listen to?
Alexi: In Russia young 
people, especially teenagers, 
are fond of American music, 
heavy metal, hard rock music. 
As of people my age they mostly 
prefer music of 60’s and 70’s, 
English and American, the
Beatles, BeeGees, Rolling Stones, 
those classics.
Tartan: Do you play this music 
on your show?
Alexi: Not much because of the 
legislation. We can’t use foreign 
pieces without permission.
Tartan: Maybe someday it will 
go both ways, you’ll play Ameri­
can music on your radio, and we’ll 
play Russian music on ours.
Alexi: We have American mu­
sic on our radio. I mean, Radio 
Moscow. It’s very much Ameri­
can music now, especially at mid­
night. Music is an international 
language. Music helps communi­
cations. Many Russian guys 
started studying English because 
of British pop groups. It helps.
I hope the Russians went home 
with as good an impression of üs
as I had of them. As Klim Shonw 
yeo, the group leader, said in his; 
speech at the beginning of the; 
reception, “We can say that if our 
people, American and Soviet, will- 
live in peace, we will make peace 
in the world a reality. We ask you' 
to help us strengthen the peace 
and promote understanding and 
friendship. You are welcome to: 
visit the Soviet Union.”

they simply don’t like to think 
about the issue at all. One stu­
dent commented, “It’s easier 
not to think about it. 1 mean, 
it’s much easier to think about 
what you’re going to do tomor­
row, or next week, or five years 
down the road, but thinking 
about how you’re going to 
spend eternity is a very differ­
ent issue.”
Although the topic of faith is 
often danced around or ig­
nored, there are those students 
on campus who do know how 
they feel about religion. “A 
belief in God is the end-all of 
human existence. Faith in God 
as our Creator and our future 
is the only explanation for 
meaning in'life,” one student 
said.
Another student felt that 
“Many people believe that man 
created God, but I simply 
cannot believe that is true, per­
haps religion, but not God. To 
me, it simply makes sense that 
when you look at the sky or the 
trees or feel the wind, or even 
see a small child running, that 
there has to be God who knows 
much more about goodness 
than we, as humans, ever 
could.”

One student mentioned 
religion’s therapeutic properties. 
“God is very important to my life, 
He’s the only one who’s always 
there to talk to.”
There are those on the other 
end of the spectrum who say, “I 
don’t believe in God. It’s a nice 
thought, but simply not true.” 
Another agreed. “I have trouble 
accepting on faith the existence 
of God. There’s no proof, no rea­
son to believe that he or she ex­
ists.”
A small minority of students 
have an active belief in an active 
God, and another minority have 
ruled out God and religion alto-
gether. It seems however, that 
both atheists and those people 
who choose to base their lives on 
what they believe, are the excep­
tion rather than the rule. It 
appears that many people here 
at CMU simply haven’t thought 
a lot about what they really do 
believe in, and if they have 
thought about it, they really 
haven’t explored the possibilities 
of where their decision might take 
them.
Cliffe Knechtle said that many 
CMU students seem to believe 
that truth is irrelevant. Perhaps 
students need to come to some 
conclusion of their own about
what the truth really is. If the 
statements of these CMU stu­
dents are valid, then many stu­
dents simply don’t think a lot 
about what is and isn’t true.
Maybe students are afraid that 
if they think about and explore 
the issue they might reach an 
undesirable conclusion. Perhaps 
not believing in anything, or at 
least not thinking about what 
one believes in, is a bit too com­
fortable to really make sense.
One student answered our 
question about religion straight­
forwardly. “I honestly don’t 
know,” he said.
Is this reply really good enough?

Men's team has a perfect 10...
Cross country teams 
finish fine ’88 season
By LEN O’NEAL & RACHEL NOBEL
Tartan Staffwriters
For the tenth consecutive year, the Carnegie Mellon Men’s 
Cross Country Team has finished with an unblemished dual 
meet record, adding eight more victories to Coach Gary Meckleys 
already impressive career at CMU. The eight victories bring 
the team’s NCAA record of consecutive victories to 98, leaving 
the much sought-after century mark for next season.
The Tartans tracked their seventh and eighth victories in 
fine fashion two Saturdays ago with the majority of the team 
running personal bests on the 5-mile Schenley Park course.
Leading the way for the Tartans was junior Dave Supp, who 
finished in an impressive time of 25:18. For his latest effort, 
Supp was named the UAA Cross Country Athlete of the Week. 
The Tartans took the next eleven places in the meet, thereby 
defeating both Robert Morris College and Thiel College by a 
score of 15-50.
Also scoring for the Tartans were senior Pat Noll, second 
place, and juniors Gary Meeker, Tim Berger and Len O'Neal, 
finishing third, fourth and fifth, respectively.
With the dual meets out of the way, the team must now focus 
its sights on the upcoming UAA Championships at Washington 
University in St. Louis on Saturday. The following Saturday, 
the Tartans will host the PAC Championships, and after a 
week long rest, it is on to the Regionals meet where the Tartans 
will make a bid for their eleventh trip to Nationals in the last 
twelve years.
The Tartan runners are entering the home stretch of their 
season, and as far as Meckley is concerned, avoiding injuries 
and illness are key for the remainder of the season. “Talent- 
wise, I’ve coached better teams. But as for potential, this is 
definitely the best team I’ve ever had. The guys are running 
very well and as long as they stay healthy, I seriously think we 
can win Regionals and do well at Nationals.”
Although their goal is set on Nationals, the team is definitely 
not overlooking the UAA and PAC Championships. The Tartan 
cross country team is hoping to better its third place finish at 
last year’s UAA Championships, and to capture its eighth 
straight PAC Championship.
The Carnegie Mellon Women’s Cross Country team contin­
ues to improve and impress as they handily defeated Robert 
Morris, 20-38, and gave Pitt’s Lady Panthers a run for their 
money, even though Pitt prevailed, 23-32.
While Pitt’s Chrissus and Azeke acquired both first and 
second places, Kristin Burgard flew across the finish line in 
third place with a personal record of 19:33. Coming through 
the cones at 19:49, Sue Johnson picked off sixth place for CMU. 
With major improvements in time, the two fabulous freshmen 
Carolyn Lowe and Lois Raska took eighth and ninth place, 
respectively.
With incredible performances by both first year senior Rose- 
anna Neupauer and sophomore Sue Sparks, Carnegie Mellon 
snagged 11th and 13th place. Emily Burke and Kathy Bonham 
rounded out the CMU field of the total 29 runners.
Women’s Head Coach, Dario Donatelli, feels that, ‘The times 
overall are about thirty seconds faster than they were at this 
time last year. The girls and I are both happy with these 
results. We are looking forward to the next weekend off to 
develop team strength.”
clearly states in Chapter One: 
“Thou shalt not print non- 
; sports related stories in thou’s 
; section.” This comes right after: 
' “Thou shalt never take a Mets 
fan seriously,” but that’s 
another issue entirely.
The point is that for some bi­
zarre reason, newspapers,
- magazines and television news 
shows have elected to tell the 
Mike Tyson/Robin Givens 
divorce tale alongside legiti- 
«mate sports stories. Amongst 
1 other stories, including the 
/ Olympics and Major League 
Playoffs, sportscasters and 
writers were dealing with 
issues like: “How much is 
Givens suing for?” and, “Is 
Mike Tyson really a nut-case?”
Why? Mike Tyson is the 
Heavyweight Champion of the 
world so he is, naturally, a 
public figure. However, none of 
this divorce fiasco stuff is in 
' any way related to boxing.
Someone who is perusing the 
= sports page is not doing so in 
: order to find out if Tyson really 
decked his wife, or if she really 
did have a part on the Cosby 
Show. That person wants to see 
when Tyson’s next fight is and 
if Donald Trump is going to try 
to rip off the American boxing 
fan yet again by charging $500 
a ticket for another 10 second 
fight. In other words, relevant 
sports information.
Because of the Tyson/Givens 
story, I couldn’t tell Entertain­
ment Tonight from the local 
sports broadcast. Even on 
ABC’s Nightline, Ted Koppel 
was interviewing “close associ­
ates” of both parties trying to 
get to the heart of the story. I 
thought all of this attention 
was quite silly. The only place 
the story made sense was in 
People magazine where people 
look for this kind of mindless 
melodrama.
In a nutshell, Tyson went out 
to Hollywood for his wife’s “ca­
reer,” and went from being 
plain old sports hero to one of 
the beautiful people. He got 
suckered in and got clubbed by 
a powerful combination of 
dashed dreams and lost love.
One really can’t blame all of 
this excessive and often mean­
ingless coverage on the media, 
either. Such interest comes 
with the job; being the Heavy­
weight Champion of the World 
has its drawbacks. It’s not like 
being a World Series winner or 
even an Olympic Gold Medal­
ist. The money associated with 
being a boxing champ is incred­
ible and is the source of the 
attention.
One man gets over $15 
million in some cases (if not 
more) for a few moments in the 
ring whether he wins or loses 
— such a phenomenon occurs 
in no other sport.
How could anyone, including 
Tyson himself, expect him to 
handle such wealth at such a 
young age after a whole life of 
hardship? It was too much, too 
soon.
Let’s get back to the basics in 
the sports section and leave all 
of this soap opera baloney for 
those rags in the checkout lines 
at the Giant Eagle. I’m even 
sorry for giving it time here.

Soccer in strong shape 
heading into season’s end
By JUDY GROSSMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
Times have not all been easy 
for Carnegie Mellon’s Soccer 
team. Even though they are cur­
rently in second place in the 
President’s Athletic Conference, 
tension among the players is high 
as they enter the home stretch of 
the 1988 season.
Last Saturday, the Tartans 
beat Presidents’ Athletic Confer­
ence rival Grove City, 4-1, and on 
Wednesday night, they battled a 
tough University of Pittsburgh 
team to a 1-1 tie in overtime.
The Grove City win put the 
Tartans one game above .500 with 
an overall record of 5-4-2. CMU is 
1-1 in PAC play, second only, to 
Bethany. The Tartans will play 
Bethany in their final game of 
the season, which could very well 
be for the PAC title.
The Tartans had little trouble 
with Grove City. The 3-6-1 Wol­
verines were unable to contain 
CMU’s Eddie Park, last week’s 
University Athletic Association
Player of the Week. The junior 
netted all four Tartan goals on 
the way to the 4-1 win.
In the first half, Park scored on 
a penalty shot to give the Tartans 
a 1-0 lead. Later, Park scored on 
a Bob Stefanowicz cross, as the 
ball sailed over the Wolverine 
goalkeeper, and on a feed by 
senior Alan Stein. His final shot 
went unassisted, a dribbler that 
barely got past the goalie.
On the defensive side, Tartan 
goalies Glen Hoogerwerf and 
Jamie Ruffin shared time, and 
were able to repel the Wolverine 
attack.
Wednesday night against Pitt, 
the defense again played a key 
role. Hoogerwerfs numerous 
saves in overtime kept the Tar­
tans from coming up losers.
“Glen played a very good game,” 
said sophomore midfielder Mike 
Ferrence. “He had a lot of key 
saves, and he kept us going even 
though we didn’t play well.” 
Hoogerwerf ranks second in PAC 
goalies with a 1.41 goals-against 
average, and in saves with 72.
Freshman Rob Schaeffer scored 
the Tartan’s lone goal, but other 
than that, the offense appeared 
flat. The Panthers out-shot the 
Tartans 19-5. Fortunately, the 
Pitt offense could fare no better 
than CMU’s as they too managed 
only one goal in the match.
“The offense hasn’t been pro­
ducing when it needs to be,” said 
Ferrence. “We didn’t muster any 
scoring threats and were lucky to 
come away with a tie.”
Last Sunday, CMU defeated 
Washington University in St. 
Louis, last year’s national run- 
ner-up, 2-1.
Scoring for the Tartans were 
Park, assisted by Doug Jotzke, 
and Delon Mollett, assisted by 
Young Kang and Justin Pizzella. 
Goalie Hoogerwerf had 10 saves 
in the game.
Carnegie Mellon travels to St. 
Vincent College tomorrow for a 
scheduled 4:00 pm start. The 
team will then host the Presi­
dents of Washington & Jefferson 
on Saturday, October 22nd at

Special to The Tartan
In the past two weeks the 
Carnegie Mellon Football Tar­
tans have toppled from the un­
beaten ranks, and at the same 
time have fallen out of conten­
tion for the 1988 President’s 
Athletic Conference champion­
ship.
With two consecutive losses, 
24-7 to the John Carroll Blue 
Streaks and a heartbreaking 29- 
21 loss to the Hiram Terriers, the 
Tartans (1-2 PAC, 4-2 overall) 
have fallen from being ranked 
second in the South Region to 
just another team in the 
President’s Athletic Conference.
Over mid-semester break the 
Tartans hosted the John Carroll 
Blue Streaks in a battle of PAC 
powerhouses. The Blue Streaks 
came into the game at 1-1 in 
conference play after a 20-13 
defeat at the hands of the Wash­
ington and Jefferson Presidents. 
The Blue Streaks played strong 
defense, holding the Tartans to 
only one touchdown on the after­
noon, which came in the first 
quarter.
The Tartan defense played well 
in the first* three quarters, hold­
ing the Blue Streaks to only three 
points on three drives inside the 
Tartan 20. The Tartans’ Kent 
Hess intercepted a pass in the 
end zone to end one Blue Streak 
drive, and that earned him WRCT

CMU tennis loses in PAC tournament
By JOSH RUBEN
Tartan Sports Editor
Carnegie Mellon played host to the President’s 
Athletic Conference (PAC) Women’s Tennis 
Championships last weekend. The Lady Tar­
tans did their home court fans proud even though 
they lost to last year’s champ,Grove City, 19-18.
CMU was most impressive in the singles 
matches, winning three out of the six brackets.
Beth Cavanaugh started things with a seem­
ingly easy cruise through the #2 singles bracket. 
She got a bye in the first round, then beat Cathy 
Celia of Washington& Jefferson 6-2, 6-2 in the 
semi-finals. “I was really fired up about that 
match,” said the CMU junior, “[Celia] beat me 
earlier in the season and I had a lot to prove.”
Cavanaugh faced Grove City’s Linda Lex in 
the finals and had to rely on her mental strength 
more than her physical ability. “I tried to out­
smart her because I wasn’t playing my best;” Ca­
vanaugh had trouble with her serves but was 
able to outlast her 
opponent and win 
the championship 
6-4, 6-3.
Suzi Dottor did 
not advance to the 
#1 singles final 
due to a semi-final 
loss to Devon 
Cairns of Grove 
City 6-3, 7-6 (7-4 
tie breaker).
Alice Garber got the team back on track with 
an easy sweep through the #4 singles bracket. 
The only rough spot for the sophomore from 
Greensburg, Pa. came in her semi-final match. 
Pat Bradkte of John Carroll won the first set 
handily, 1-6. This sparked Garber and she came 
back to take the last two sets, 6-2, 6-3.
*Fifth seed Tracy Boyd got a bye in the first 
round on Friday, and then trounced Laura 
Pawk of W & J 6-0, 6-2 to advance to the finals. 
Boyd put up a tough fight against Grove City’s 
Julie Caruso, forcing three sets. She came up 
short, losing to the GC senior 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
The final bright spot of the singles matches for 
CMU came in the form of a win from senior 
Sohee Chung, playing in the #6 spot. After get­
ting'by Barb Bosow of Hiram in the semis, 6-2, 
6-2, Chung all but swept John Carroll sopho­
more Suzanne Huber, 6-1, 6-2, in the finals.
Going in to the doubles finals on Saturday, 
CMU led the tournament. The Lady Tartans 
had both of their #1 and #2 doubles teams in the 
finals. However, Grove City also had two teams
playing; #2 and #3, and was looking to give CMU 
a tough time on court #2.
Cavanaugh and Dottor took on Cairns and 
Chris Marton of Grove City in the final. Cairns 
and Marton came out strong in the opening 
games and led for most of the first set. Encour­
agement from teammates and each other spurred 
on the Lady Tartans to come back and win the 
set, 7-5. “Something about almost losing really 
wakes us up,” said Cavanaugh after the match.
The second set saw both teams hitting high 
lobs in order to keep the other team from build­
ing up momentum. Again Cavanaugh and Dot­
tor came from behind to win the second set 7-5, 
along with the championship.
Grove City’s Caren Hiser and Amy Wherley 
won the #3 match against John Carroll which 
put the pressure on Mary Beth Ashbaugh and 
Tracy Boyd on court two. They were in the 
closing games of their #2 doubles match with 
Grove City’s Caruso and Lex.
As has been the case in the PAC for the past 
three years, the 
overall title 
rested on the out­
come of the last 
doubles match. 
Boyd and Ash­
baugh played 
tough all through 
the match and 
won the first set 
6-4. Strong serv­
ing by Grove City 
gave the Lady Wolverines the second set, 6-1.
In the middle of the final set, Boyd began to 
suffer some back problems and even had to re­
quest a stoppage of play in order to let her 
partner try to rub out the soreness in her muscles.
Ultimately, Caruso and Lex proved to be too 
strong and took the final set 6-3. They won the 
title for themselves and the overall champion­
ship for Grove City.
The final point tally went: Grove City (19), 
CMU (18), John Carroll (11), W & J (7), Hiram 
(5) and Thiel (3).
Grove City Head Coach Patti Zbell commented 
after the tournament, that Carnegie Mellon had 
the most depth and provided an excellent match 
for her team in the #2 doubles match. Zbell con­
fessed that she has had to depend a great deal on 
her doubles teams because the singles players 
have not been that strong.
With a look of satisfaction, she concluded, 
“Nobody walked away with anything [at this 
tournament]. Everyone played hard and earned 
everything they got.”
“Nobody walked away with any­
thing. Everybody earned what 
they got. ”

AMERICA'S HALLOWEEN HEADQUARTERS
The Carnegie Mellon Women’s 
'Volleyball team continued its 
roller-coaster season, winning 
three matches and losing two 
since its return from the UAA 
Round Robin Tournament two 
weeks ago.
Last Saturday, the Lady Tar­
tans faced the Lady Wolverines 
of Grove City College for the 
second timethis season. The first 
meeting of these two teams re­
sulted in a three hour, five game 
match and- a Carnegie Mellon 
loss.
The second meeting was not as 
long. The Lady Wolverines took 
the match in three games, 15-6, 
15-12 and 15-8.
In the first game, Grove City 
sophomore Christine Carlson 
served 8 consecutive points to 
stretch their lead to 11-1. The 
Lady Tartans covered the court 
well, but a lack of communica­
tion caused many errors. They 
scored five more points before 
¿rove City put the game away, 
15-6.
The seGond game started with 
Grove City’s Renee Stas putting 
6 points on the board for the Lady 
Wolverines. Later, Carnegie 
Mellon retaliated as Freshman 
Deb Perry served 6 points to tie 
the score, 8-8. The score was tied 
again at 11 and 12 points apiece, 
but Grove City managed to score 
15 while the Lady Tartans tried 
ter regroup.
Things started looking up for 
CMU in the third game. For the 
first time in the match, the Lady 
Tartans had a lead. The score 
was 7-5 when this glimmer of 
hope was put out by Lady Wol­
verine Mich- ______________________
elle Steiger- 
wald. The 
freshman 
served the 
next eight 
points, win­
ning the
game, 15-8, 
and the
match for 
Grove City.
Errors on service (7), hitting 
(12), receiving (15) and blocking 
12) kept CMU down. Offensively, 
Carnegie Mellon was led by jun­
ior Kris Loh and sophomore Ni­
cole Hanak, who combined for 11 
of the team’s 25 kills. Junior 
Laurie Shumaker had 18 assists, 
and sophomore Cindy Peperak 
contributed with five serving 
aces.
Last Tuesday, the Lady Tar­
tans traveled to West Virginia

ne ­u1o63 4nan,w r8sue cnCso 7BL?
where they made short work of 
Bethany (15-3, 15-9) and West 
Liberty College (15-4, 15-4).
In the match against Bethany, 
Hanak recorded 10 kills for the 
CMU offense. The defense was 
sparked by the blocking of Ha­
nak and Shumaker. Hanak had 
four solo blocks and three as­
sists, while Shumaker had three 
solo blocks and one assist.
Carnegie iviellon also had a fine 
showing against West Liberty. 
Hanak led the offense with 7 kills, 
followed by senior Diane Wat­
son, Loh and Shumaker with four 
apiece. Loh
“We don’t come back 
fighting, we just lie 
down and die. ”
— Head Coach 
Sue Flaherty
and Wat­
son also 
served four 
aces each 
in the 
match.
The Lady 
Teniers of 
Hiram 
were the 
victims of 
the CMU offensive attack last 
Saturday. Hanak and Perry com­
bined for 18 kills in the match, 
and were helped along by three 
serving aces apiece by Peperak 
and Perry. The Lady Tartans won 
the match in three games, 15-9, 
15-10, 15-8.
Only six Lady Tartans were 
present at the match against 
President’s Athletic Conference 
leader John Carroll two weeks 
ago. CMU started slowly against

the Lady Blue Streaks, losing 
the first game, 15-7.
“We were physically there, but 
not mentally,” said Head Coach 
Sue Flaherty. “In warm-ups, we 
were hitting OK, but when the - 
game started, we went back to 
non-communication. Lack of 
communication always hurts.”
The second game started bet­
ter for the Lady Tartans, but six 
straight points served by JCU’s 
Karen Bito put the Lady Blue 
Streaks in the lead, 7-4. Carne­
gie Mellon tied the game at 9 
apiece. John Carroll came back 
to win the game on six points 
served by sophomore Kerry 
Spicer, 15-9.
Game three began with a serv­
ing ace by junior Chris Mauro, a 
point for the Lady Blue Streaks 
and three points served by Loh. 
A streak of five serves by JCU’s 
Spicer put the score at 6-4. CMU 
got two more, but was unable to 
score a point until the score was 
12-6 in favor of John Carroll. The 
Lady Tartans scored four times 
before losing the match, 10-15.
The team had 31 kills in the 
match, led by Hanak and Perry, 
recording 10 and 7 kills, respec­
tively.
“We get behind and we quit. 
We don’t come back fighting, we 
just he down and die,” commented 
Flaherty.
The Lady Tartans are now 4-3 
in the PAC and UAA, and 12-11 
overall.

Team Bar met Pilam in the 
championship game of the 
Intermediate League Co-Rec 
Volleyball, last week.
Team Bar was looking good 
as they spiked balls onto 
Pilam’s court. Pilam re­
grouped, and they were able to 
stop the Team Bar offense, but 
it was not enough. Team Bar 
wtfn the first set 15-9.
Pilam took charge in the sec­
ond set with an early score of 
8-0, taking advantage of the 
weak Team Bar defense. Team 
Bar finally got a chance at 
offense, but was not able to 
catch Pilam , losing 10-15.
The third and final game of 
thé series started out as a close 
match. Neither team got ahead 
by more then one point in the
first ten minutes of the game. 
Team Bar finally got rolling with 
a four point run, giving them a 6- 
2 lead. Pilam returned to offense 
and got another point. Team Bar 
took over, and with nine straight 
points, won the game, 15-3, and 
the championship.
Throughout the season, Team 
Bar lost only two games, one in 
the playoffs and the other in this 
match. According to Team Cap­
tain, David Long, “The women 
made the team what it is.”
In the last week of regular play 
for IM major football, four teams 
vied for the two spots in the cham­
pionship game. Beta and Crunch 
Bunch had to win to gain a spot, 
while Pika needed a win and an 
ATO loss to advance.
The first game pitted Pika 
against Beta. Pika received the 
ball, but ended up punting.
Led by quarterback J.D.
Heskamp, Beta drove down 
the field and scored on a short 
pass. The extra point was good, 
putting Beta in front 8-0.
Pika regained possession 
and quickly scored a touch­
down. The extra point attempt 
failed and Beta led by a point 
at the end of the first quarter.
Beta took over and Heskamp 
ran the ball in for his second 
TD. A missed extra point kept 
the game within six points.
Smith led Pika down the 
field and threw for his second 
TD. The extra point was good 
and the game was tied for the 
remainder of the first half.
On the first play of the sec­
ond half, Heskamp completed 
a touchdown pass to Bill Kra­
mer. The extra point attempt 
was good and extended Beta’s 
lead to seven.

This is the fourth in a series of 
! articles giving a brief over- 
eui of this year’s NFL teams. 
This week: The National Foot- 
ill Conference (NFC) Western 
ivision.
San Francisco 49ers: Per- 
aps the most dominant team 
ist year, the 49ers were ranked 
Irst in both offense and defense. 
,ed by the 
IFC’s high- 
st rated pas- 
sfJoe Mon- 
uia, and a

9ers have

¡cord. This offense, combined 
lith the great Niners’ secondary,

lampions of the NFC West, 
ley can go to the Super Bowl if 
stay healthy.
New Orleans Saints: The big- 
st surprise in the league last 
ar, the Saints made the play- 
then lost to the Minnesota 
kings in the wild card game, 
the main improvement from
last year is in the form of rookie 
wide receiver Brett Perriman. 
Quarterback Bobby Hebert will 
be able to count on Perriman to 
go deep to provide a tough scor­
ing threat.
Former Pitt running back Craig 
“Iron Head” Heyward will also 
help bolster the Saints’ ground 
game.
New Orleans has extremely 
tough linebackers. This element 
hides the team’s main weakness 
— the secondary. The- Saints
could not prevent deep pass 
penetration last year and need a 
good year from comerback Van 
Jakes to improve the secondary.
Since this is such a tough divi­
sion, the Saints have little hope 
of being the Western Champs. 
However, they should repeat as a 
wild card.
Los Angeles Rams: Running 
back Charles White led the NFL 
last year with 1374 yards rush­
ing. To further improve their 
running game though, the Rams

Men face the nation’s best
drafted UCLA sensation Gaston 
Green. This, in addition to an 
improved Jim .Everett at quar­
terback, will make the Rams an 
even tougher offensive team. 
However, the most dangerous 
weapons lie in draft picks Aaron 
Cox and Willie Anderson.
If the offensive line can hold 
up, the Rams will be unstoppable. 
The question will be: Can the 
Rams’ pass rush put pressure on 
opposing quarterbacks? If this 
defense holds up, the Rams can 
challenge the 
Niners and 
the Saints.
Their inex­
perience as a 
team will 
hurt the 
Rams down 
the stretch. 
But even 
though they 
will finish 
third, they 
will be a force 
to reckon 
with in the 
future.
Atlanta Falcons: The Falcons, 
ranked last in both offense and 
defense last year, will probably 
not improve. Quarterback Chris 
Miller is a promising young tal­
ent but he has no receivers.
The defense will get some help 
from first round pick, Audrey 
Bruce, who had a fantastic col­
lege career.
After going 3-12 last year, the 
Falcons can be thankful that they 
cannot do much worse in 1988.

The Carnegie Mellon Men’s Cross Country Team 
is off to Washington University in St. Louis this 
weekend for the UAA Championships, and they 
are more than ready for the competition.
As of now, the UAA is boasting the strongest 
Division III conference in the nation, with five of 
its teams, including Carnegie Mellon, ranked 
among the top 20.
Rochester and Brandéis are expected to vie for 
the championship, but the other three teams could 
have something to say about that.
According to Tartan Head Coach Gary Meckley, 
the teams from Rochester and Brandéis could be 
categorized as two of the “great” teams in the 
country, with Brandéis having a definite shot at 
winning the National Championships.
Of Brandéis’ top runners, all have either indi­
vidually qualified for the National Champion­
ships or have been All-Americans. Top performers 
for Brandéis this year are the Kimball Brothers 
and Scott Kantor.
As for Rochester, they return all five of the 
runners that lead them to the UAA Championship 
last year. Their hopes will depend greatly on their 
top two runners, A1 Smith and John Moran.
Case Western Reserve provides a team that 
should not be overlooked. Meckley considers them 
to be a strong squad with a lot of depth. Washing­
ton University will place its hopes on their top 
runner, Derrick Peterman, and also on their home 
field advantage. “On their own course,” said 
Meckley, “they could definitely be tough.”
While some of the UAA teams — New York 
University, Johns Hopkins University, Univer­
sity of Chicago and Emory University — will be 
looking for team members to gain individual 
honors, the Tartan squad feels it can definitely 
keep in contention with the other tough runners.
Junior co-captain Dave Supp, who finished sev­
enth at last year’s Inaugural Championship and 
was recently named UAA Cross Country Athlete 
of the Week, feels very optimistic about the meet. 
“If everything goes right, we could have three or 
four guys make the All-UAA team,” stated Supp.
The Tartan squad looks stronger than ever 
entering this year’s championships. However, 
Meckley is keeping a more conservative attitude 
towards the race than Supp. “If the guys run an 
intelligent race, and concentrate on what they are 
doing, things will fall in place for them.”
Women look to finish in top three

The Carnegie Mellon Women’s Cross Country 
team will be flying across the eastern United States 
to attend the University Athletics Association (UAA) 
Championships at Washington University in St. 
Louis, Missouri this Friday.
The team will be competing against nine of the 
toughest Division III teams in the nation, including 
some of the highest ranked academic universities 
in the country. In addition to CMU, those teams 
invited are Emory University, New York Univer­
sity, Washington University of St. Louis, Univer­
sity of Rochester, Case Western Reserve Univer­
sity, Chicago University, Brandéis University and 
Johns Hopkins University.
Last year the University of Rochester took top 
honors. Rochester Coach O’Donnell says,”We should 
be able to pull off another win. On almost any given 
5000M course, I have five girls under a time of 
20:30. This provides the team with both individual 
and team strength. Josefa Benzoni [UAA Athlete of 
the Week after her win of the Lemoine Invitational] 
and Kata Rittenberg have been leading the team to 
victory all season. Hopefully this will continue.”
In addition to this fierce competition, Brandéis, 
Wash. U., Emory, and CMU are all vying for the 
remaining four spots. Brandéis has decent depth, 
but the spotlight rests upon Nicole Fogerty, who 
clocked a 16:52 for 5000 M at her last invitational.
The host of the meet,Wash. U.,not only has home 
course advantage, but also five light-footed women 
that are very talented.
NYU and CWRU both are building upon young 
teams. Don Cox, the coach at Case Western, is in his 
his first year of coaching and has mostly freshmen 
with which to work.
. Injuries have plagued NYU, leaving their second 
and third runners, Elizabeth Kmiecik and Liz Heite, 
out for most of the season.
The Lady Tartans can run with all of these teams. 
Although Emory University beat them last year by 
six points, Coach Dario Donatelli concludes that, 
“It’s time to fight back. With an excellent showing, 
we can realistically take third or fourth place.” In 
order to do this, the Tartans will need top perform­
ances from junior Sue Johnson and sophomore 
Kristin Burgard. Both have lead the team through­
out the season. Junior RoseannaNeupauer, sopho­
more Sue Sparks, and freshmen Carolyn Lowe and 
Lois Raska will also play important roles in a strong 
Tartan finish.

Folks here are still talking about 
“The 1952 Incident.” For some reason 
still unknown, a certain graduating class 
at a certain university missed what was 
certainly the opportunity of a lifetime.
The chance to meet with a recruiter 
from the National Security Agency.
Maybe they were busy that day. May­
be something else caught their eye. But 
the fact remains, a meeting with NSA 
could have meant a future full of chal­
lenging, exciting projects.
Now you’ve got the same chance. Our 
recruiter will be visiting campus soon in 
search of talented mathematicians,
computer scientists, electrical engineers 
and linguists. And we're looking for 
people who want to work on important, 
hands-on assignments right from the 
start of their career.
NSA is the agency responsible for 
producing foreign intelligence informa­
tion, safeguarding our government’s 
communications and securing computer 
systems for the Department of Defense.
And we’re equally committed to help­
ing you make your future strong. So do 
yourself a favor and meet with us. You 
don’t need 3-D glasses to see that it’s a 
great opportunity.

, The Tartan defense also held 
Ufie Blue Streaks inside the one 
¦yard line on fourth down to stall 
¦another Blue Streak drive.
I The fourth quarter belonged to 
¦John Carroll. They scored the go 
¦ahead touchdown with only 6:48 
jremainingin the game. With that 
¦touchdown, the Tartans fell 
¦ emotionally flat, and John Car- 
I roll got another two touchdowns 
I to complete the scoring.
I The Tartans went to Hiram 
\ College last weekend iii desper­
ate need of a win. The Terriers, 
led by senior tailback Bobby 
Starks, looked to please the fans 
at their annual Homecoming.
The Tartans again struck first. 
With 25 seconds left in the first 
quarter, sophomore halfback 
Scott Bamyak put the Tartans 
on top with a six yard run. The 
scoring drive was set up by junior 
Dave Skinner’s 25 yard intercep- 
; tion return of a Rich Pierce pass. 
For Skinner, it was his second 
interception of the year. Jim 
Kelly’s extra point was good, and 
thji Tartans possessed a 7-0 lead 
after one quarter.
___Both teams exchanged touch- 
-dewns and extra points in the 
second quarter, with the Tartan 
score set up by a Starks fumble 
with only a minute remaining in 
the half. Freshman quarterback 
Steve Patemo put the Tartans 
1 on top again with a ten yard pass 
to WRCT Player of the Game 
Mike Beresford. Beresford had
11 receptions on the day for 120 
yards and a touchdown to earn 
the honors.
At halftime, the Tartans held 
onto a 14-7 lead.
The Tartans did capitalize on 
two Terrier mistakes, but Hiram 
was lucky they were only down 
l$Jeven after 30 minutes of play. 
'$§3 Terriers were assessed with 
nine penalties for 100 yards and 
-committed five turnovers which 
included two interceptions, two 
fumbles, and one on downs.
However, the Tartans were only 
able to put fourteen points on the 
board. Patemo was 10 for 18 in 
the first half, for 107 yards and a 
touchdown. For the Terriers, 
Starks was the bright spot, car­
rying the ball 14 times for 82 
yards in the first half.
Once again in the second half, 
the Tartans put points on the 
board first. With 2:26 remaining 
in the third, senior co-captain 
Chris Hansen put the ball in from 
one yard out for his fourth touch­
down of the year. The score was 
set up by a 53 yard run by Bam­
yak, who was tripped up at the 
Hiram one yard line.
The Terriers struck back 
quickly, engineering a four play, 
78 yard drive, capped by a break­
down in the Tartan defense that 
allowed senior Bill Demidovich 
to scamper for a 67 yard touch­
down run. After the extra point, 
CMU held a 21-14 lead. This 
would last only five minutes.
After both teams exchanged 
possessions, the Terriers were 
able to go ahead for good after 
Patemo was intercepted at the 
Tartan 27 by freshman line­
backer Brian Workman. Work­
man returned the ball to the 
Tartan 25 yard line, where the 
Terriers scored only three plays 
later. With a first down at the 
Tartan 12, Starks got the call 
again, but fooled the Tartan de­
fense by throwing the halfback 
option to Demidovich who was 
all alone in the end zone.
Down by one point, 21-20, the 
Terriers decided to go for the two 
point conversion. Starks was once 
again the big play man, as he 
scooted free in the Tartan end 
zone and received a Pierce pass 
to put the Terriers ahead for the 
first time, 22-21 with 10 minutes 
to play.
The game was far from over, as 
both defenses toughened up. The 
Tartans got the ball back with 
1:36 remaining at midfield after 
a Terrier punt. Patemo com­
pleted three passes to Beresford,
which put the ball all the way 
down to the Hiram 22. Hansen 
then ran the ball to the 20 yard 
line, with the clock running in­
side of 25 seconds.
The Tartans decided to end the 
game on a Jim Kelly field goal, 
but had to stop the clock before 
they brought out the kicking unit. 
Patemo’s throw away sideline 
pass was not high enough, so the 
Terriers junior comerback Mike 
Murphy stepped right in the way 
and picked off the pass. Murphy 
was off to the races down the 
sidelines, and trotted in with an 
80 yard interception return. The 
extra point was good, and with 
three seconds remaining, the 
Terriers had a 29-21 advantage.
Hiram squib kicked the kickoff 
to Tartan junior tight end Gary 
Gojsovich, who could not move 
the ball down field before time 
ran out.
With the loss, Carnegie Mellon 
will have to dig deep down inside 
and find some extra incentive to 
play the rest of their season. In 
three weeks, the team will face 
Washington and Jefferson Col­
lege, but the Tartans will have 
time to regroup against Thiel and 
Grove City Colleges before they 
have to go down to Washington 
to face the Presidents.
The last time the Tartans trav­
elled on 1-79 to play W&J, Carne­
gie Mellon was handed a con­
vincing 40-7 defeat. Last year 
the Presidents, ranked second in 
the country at the time, won the 
game 38-36 on a 41 yard John 
Ivory field goal with eight ticks 
left on the clock.
The Tartan loss puts them 
fourth in the PAC standings, with 
Hiram and Washington and Jef­
ferson Colleges first with 4-0 rec­
ords. The Blue Streaks are now 
third at 3-1, followed by the Tar­
tans at 1-2.
Next week the Tartans face 
Thiel College in the annual 
Homecoming game at Mt. Leba­
non Stadium. Kickoff is sched­
uled for 2:00 pm.
continued from page L15
Pika took over and at­
tempted to move down the 
field. An interception ended 
the drive, but Beta couldn’t 
capitalize on the turnover.
Pika scored with only 1:17 
left in the game. On the extra 
point attempt, Smith’s pass 
was broken up by Kramer.
Beta won, 27-19, keeping 
Pika from the playoffs for the 
first time in five years.
ATO started the second game 
with a drive that stalled and had 
them punting. Crunch Bunch 
received the ball, and six plays 
later, QB Robert Bowie ran the 
ball in for a TD. ATO replied with 
a TD, but failed to convert. By the 
half, Crunch Bunch led, 14-6.
Bowie started the second half 
with a TD pass. ATO, down by 
fifteen, drove the ball the length 
of the field, scoring on a Jim Camp 
pass to Chris Koscho. The extra
point failed.
Crunch Bunch dominated 
the rest of the game, and won 
28-12.
Since three teams qualified 
for the finals, team captains 
drew straws to see who would 
play. ATO and Crunch Bunch 
will meet Oct. 18 at 5:30 to see 
who will play Beta in the 
championship game, which 
will be the following Thurs­
day at 4:30.
