By the -time this issue of the Tartan 
is distributed among the students of 
this school, the arrangements for the 
much heralded Junior Prom, will have 
been completed. Those Juniors who 
do not attend cannot complain about 
being slighted, for every one has been 
urged to go at least a few times. They 
will surely miss the crowning social 
event of the Junior year.
Other Juniors, who do not dance, 
have loyally stood by the class in the 
matter and have supported it finan­
cially. They know they cannot shine 
on the dancing floor, and yet have 
asked the nicest girl of their ac­
quaintance to share their lot for the 
evening which is to live among the 
pleasant memories of otir school life.
In arranging the Junior Prom., the 
precedent set by other schools has 
been used to a great extent, and some 
original ideas have been added. It 
is hoped to set an example to the 
under-classmen, and to thus establish 
a tradition of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools which shall be taken up year 
after year and improved upon until 
the affair is as brilliant a social event 
as any to be found anywhere in col­
lege life in America.
Those members of the class who 
are going to attend the Junior Prom, 
unaccompanied by ladies are unfor­
tunate, to say the least. Even if they 
do not dance, they should haye some 
one to talk to and discuss the fine 
points of the affair with. But make 
the best of your plight, stags, even if 
you do have to steal some other fel­
low’s girl for a few moments.
In conclusion we would say with 
“Strongheart,” “On with the dance, 
let joy be unrefined!”
The growth of mining as an en­
gineering problem is made manifest 
in these days by the magnitude of the 
ore reserves in some of the copper 
mines of the West. There was a 
time, twenty years ago—or even ten 
—when anyone who spoke of a mil­
lion tons oi ore “in sight” was re­
garded as an ignoramus or a knave, 
for in those days tuch statements 
were not, true, r and they appeared 
only in the irresponsible descriptions 
of a flamboyant prospectus or in the 
careless talk of a middleman intox­
icated by the exuberance of his own 
scheming. Other times, other facts. 
Many mines can now show, blocked 
out and ready to stope, more than 
the apochryphal million tons of a by­
gone promoter’s dream. But, as if to 
suggest that we have done with the 
loose talk of an earlier day, we no 
longer say that the ore is “in sight,” 
which, manifestly it is not until in 
the bins, but we label it “in reserve,” 
or “blocked out,” or “ready for stop- 
ing,” all of which are phrases that 
keep alongside the reality. They 
indicate that the irregular mass of 
ore or the tabular body of it between 
the walls of a vein is exposed on two, 
three, or even four sides, sufficiently 
at least to afford conclusive evidence 
as to the tonnage available. It is on 
the amount thus assured that the en­
gineering operations are based, and 
it is because that amount is so large 
in many modern mines that it has 
become possible to * devise compre­
hensive schemes of exploitation and 
reduction. For instance, in the 
mines of the Nevada Consolidated

C. E. SOCIETY.
Last Friday evening the Civil En­
gineering Society tendered a recep­
tion, in the Civil Department, to the 
Plebes, who have decided to enter the 
Civil profession next year.
Dr. Hokason, in a few well chosen 
words welcomed them, and in the 
course of his remarks emphasized the 
fact, “That no matter what profession 
or vocation one enters in life, he 
must do so with a grim determina­
tion to learn and to win; otherwise 
he cannot succeed. Mr. Seisel then 
entertained the society with a lecture 
on the Salton Sea, the water of which 
is rapidly nearing the danger line, 
due to the fact that a canal has been 
cut from the Colorado river to the sea. 
As a consequence of the unusually 
swift current of the Colorado, the 
water is rushing through the canal 
into the sea, and unless some means 
is soon provided for checking this 
flow of water great damage will be 
wrought to the surrounding country. 
The problem has become quite an 
interesting one, inasmuch as several 
unsuccessful attempts have been 
made to stop the flow, and is now 
being watched with interest by the 
engineering world.
Prof. Thayer next gave an illus­
trated lecture on the Earthquake 
Damage in California. With the aid 
of the lantern slides the students 
were enabled to compare the strength 
of the various materials used in 
building construction, and the effect 
of the shock upon each.
Mr. Reed spoke on Railroad Loca­
tion and Construction, bringing out 
the fact that in no branch of civil 
engineering is there offered such a 
variety of work and experience as 
that of Railroad Engineering.
Mr. Tingly then advised the society 
that it might be well to investigate 
the commons. All present hastily fol­
lowed his advice and soon found 
themselves under the care of Mr. 
Sharp, who with his usual good judg­
ment and management, had prepared 
a small feast.
Register Leete here occupied the 
seat of honor at the head of the table, 
and opened the speech-making with 
a few amusing tales, but soon be­
came serious and spoke of the disad­
vantage Tech is laboring under in 
her athletics. In quite a number of

dency of the students after their les­
sons are finished for the day, to go 
out on the athletic field and root for 
the teams. Here at the Tech, how­
ever, the general tendency seems to 
be to make for the trolley as soon 
as four o’clock comes.
After partaking heartily of the re­
past, and listening to a few short 
talks by different members of the 
society, the evening’s enjoyment was 
brought to a close amid cheers for 
the faculty, society and Plebes. The 
Plebes departed, congratulating them­
selves that they are about to enter 
a profession which not only has the 
distinction of being the oldest one, 
but also one which offers many oppor­
tunities to the young man. The 
members of the society feel proud, of 
the fact that they have taken another 
step in promoting good fellowship in 
the Tech. The Civil Engineering So­
ciety seems to have indeed struck 
the happy mean between foolishness 
and too much scientific thought and 
is doing excellent work. ,

REVIEWS.
A new metal called hydeslite is 
being produced at a works in Phila­
delphia. It consists of an amalga­
mation of various minerals, and when 
mixed with brass it is said to impart 
to it extraordinary strength. While 
common brass will crumble when ex­
posed to great heat, experiment shows 
that when mixed with hydeslite it 
will bend or roll hot, neither break­
ing nor crumbling.

—1910—
Owing to ill health caused by ex­
posure from strict attention to duty 
during the recent flood, Keating, of 
2-C, had to quit school before the end 
of the term. He and Oschman, of 
2-D, are employed by the Allegheny 
County Light Co., and both received 
substantial rewards from the com­
pany as a mark of its appreciation 
to the faithfulness of the two men 
in pursuing the duties of their re­
spective • positions.
Skeehan wants to join the “Shak­
ers” and Smith desires to become a 
member of the Utopian Society.
Munn, 2-B (in Physics after Dr. 
Hower had spoken of the experiment 
made with two teams of horses at­
tached to a pair of Madgeburg hem­
ispheres)—“Say, Professor, if the 
hemi-sphere were small enough could 
twenty horses pull them apart?”
Since the night of the banquet 
Considine of 2-D, is on time at class. 
Mr. Reed’s remarks were productive 
of some good in this instance.
Taylor, of 2-C, would like to be 
editor of the Tartan. He has some 
up-to-date ideas as to how a paper 
of this kind should be run.
The Entertainment Committee are 
working to arrange for a good time 
for the class at one of the Parks this 
summer.
Bowman of 2-C, says he weighs 365 
pounds up to date with good pros­
pects of reaching 400 pounds before 
the end of the month. Wonder what 
breakfast food he consumes.
Miller of -C has given up the idea 
of getting married since Prof. Wil­
lett expressed his views on the pres­
ent system of marriage; Miller says 
he is going to buy an automobile in­
stead.
We hope all of the present class 
of 1910 will return in the fall and 
enjoy the new work that is being laid 
out for us. Come back resolved to 
stay to the finish and show the rest 
of the ' educational world that engi­
neers can be made at night as well 
as during the day.
With this issue the night schools 
¦will close for the end of the 1906-07 
year. It is customary on an occasion 
of this kind for the editors to thank 
the members of their respective 
classes for the kind support given 
the paper by turning in class news 
and other articles for publication; 
and while we do not want to be con­
trary, yet, if the paper was dependant 
upon the amount of news received 
from members of the 1910 class, we 
would be publishing a paper com­
posed of the date, number of the is­
sue, picture of the schools, adver­
tisements and blank sheets. It is 
practically impossible for one man to 
wrrite all the news of the entire class, 
for he can only be in attendance at 
one section at a time and occasionally 
two, when they meet for joint recita­
tions, and therefore can only write up 
what happens in these sections. If 
the men who have been “knocking” 
the amount of news of 1910 that ap­
pears in the Tartan would get busy 
and help out, there would be no oc­
casion for their remarks. The men 
who criticise the contents of the pa­
per are very often the men who could 
gather news, but are either incom­
petent to do so, or are not interested 
enough in the paper, outside of crit­
icising other people’s efforts, to work 
for its merit.
This is not a “knock, but a long 
delayed answer to the unkind and un­
called-for remarks of several mem­
bers of the 1910 class on the scarcity 
of class news in the paper.

the single tax and a tax on bachelors?
Answer—One is intended to dis­

courages a source of expenditure, 
namely, matrimony. Hence, they 
tend to prevent the accumulation of 
wealth, but by different methods.

MINING ENGINEERING.
(Continued from page 1.) 
Copper Co. there is blocked out no 
less than twenty-two million (22,000,- 
000) tons of ore, of an average cop­
per content of 2.31 per cent., from 
which an average recovery of 33 
pounds of copper per ton is practically 
certain. This ore occurs in two sep­
arate and disconnected masses, the 
orebody in the Ruth mine being esti­
mated at 6,000,000 tons of 2.6 per 
cent, copper ore. In concentrating 
by water the loss is expected to be 
25 per cent., or 13 pounds per ton of 
ore, the further loss by smelting 
(and converting) being estimated at 
14 pounds per ton of concentrate, on 
a. concentration of seven into one; 
thus the total loss is 15 pounds and 
the estimated recovery is 37 pounds 
of copper per ton. The other ore­
body, in the Copper Flat Mine, is es­
timated at 16,000,000 tons of ore 
averaging 2.2 per cent. In working 
this ore the loss in concentrating will 
be 11 pounds per ton of ore, and in 
smelting (and converting) 18 pounds 
per ton of concentrate. The concen­
tration will be in the ratio of nine to 
one; therefore the total loss is esti­
mated at 13 pounds and the recovery 
at 31 pounds of copper per ton. By 
working two tons of Copper Flat ore 
and one of Ruth ore, the average 
yield will be 33 pounds per ton. 
The two orebodies are of entirely dif­
ferent shape and will be mined by 
different systems. That in the Ruth 
has an average width of about 200 
feet; it has been developed for a 
length of about 1,000 feet and goes 
down to a depth of about 580 feet 
below the surface. Of this 580 feet 
the first 180 feet beelow the surface 
has been leached and is valueless. 
The orebody dips at an angle of 
about 40 degrees. On the other hand, 
the Copper Flat orebody is a flat de­
posit, about 900 feet wide by 1,100 
feet long and 200 feet thick. The cap 
at the thinnest point is 25 feet deep 
and at its thickest it is 150 feet, that 
is, the orebody is nearly horizontal
and does not conform to the surface 
contour. This cap will be stripped 
by steam-shovel and the ore itself will 
be worked by this system at a total 
cost for mining and development of 
30 cents per ton. The Ruth orebody 
will be worked by the caving system 
at a total cost, for mining and devel­
opment, of 90 cents per ton. Mining 
two' tons of Copper Flat steam-shovel 
ore to one ton of Ruth caved are 
makes the total cost, including all 
development work, of 50 cents per 
ton. The concentrating and smelting 
plant now under way is designed to 
have a capacity of 4,500 tons of ore 
per 24 hours. This means the smelt­
ing of about 550 tons of concentrate 
per day. These facts are given be­
cause they are interesting and for no 
other reason; most of them have 
been stated before in other publica­
tions, but with less exactness.
The orebodies occur in a zone of 
impregnation, limited in vertical ex­
tent. How far it goes, remains yet 
to be proved. This is the largest 
tonnage of ore available in any one 
mining property, as far as we know, 
with the exception of Rio Tinto, 
which is said to be capable of pro­
ducing a million tons per annum (the 
present rate of output) for a hundred 
years. In the Transvaal there are 
mines with as much as ten million 
tons of ore assured, for example in 
the Simmer & Jack and the Robin­
son Deep, and this is why methods 
on the Rand have been developed to 
so high a degree of efficiency. We 
have mentioned the great mine at 
Ely, in Nevada, for the reason that 
its true character as a low-grade 
proposition was recognized by sev­
eral experienced mining engineers, 
who then went to work in thorough 
fashion to test the size of it, expect­
ing that either it would be proveed 
too small for the large scheme of 
operations required to secure a low 
working cost, or it would be demon­
strated to afford the means for bring­
ing such an enterprise to successful 
fruition, that is, commercial success.

freely because the security for it ex­
ists in the mine. After all, the first 
requisite for good engineering is the 
stuff to operate upon, and that is ex­
actly why mining engineering so often 
lacks the perfection or the complete­
ness of other branches of the science. 
Is it any wonder that a manager 
should be careless over the saving of 
five cents per ton in his working cost 
when the assay-value of his ore fluc­
tuates by five dollars? His energies 
are so fully occupied in finding the 
richest ore that he is bound to sub­
ordinate the question of a minimum 
cost. But give him the stuff to work 
upon and a reasonable margin in the

AUNT HANNAH’S ANSWERS TO
CORRESPONDENTS.
Dear Aunt Hannah;
If a gentleman has a date with a 
lady friend and she keeps him wait­
ing half an hour, what would you ad­
vise?
Kohler.
In love, as in base-ball, a good 
waiter is a winner. However, I 
would not explain just why I was 
holding down the corner to Plebes 
who" happen along.
Dear Aunt Hannah:
If a person wakes up in class and 
finds Prof. Hokanson and all his sec­
tion laughing at him, what ought he 
to do?
Happy W.
It is customary to turn a deep Tur­
key red; hang out a sickly smile, and 
make the best of it. It would be 
better to learn to sleep in class with­
out snoring. I advise you to try it.
Dear Aunt Hannah:
Some one has stolen my bull-dog. 
Pooor Bob was brindle, weighed 40 
pounds and had an undershot jaw. 
What would you advise?
Silvernail.
Get a red-hot stove and see if they 
will cop that.

Quite So.—Two members of the 
Princeton Faculty, during a recent 
hurried trip to New York, were on a 
Broadway car when it was stopped 
by a blockade. As they were near 
their destination they decided to get 
out and walk. The block was, how­
ever, soon lifted and the car over­
took them. “When we left the car,” 
said one of the high-brows, “who by 
the way has a bit of the Celt on him, 
I thought we should get on better 
by getting off. But after all we 
should have been better off if we 
had stayed on.

The young ladies are sorry to force 
their company on any unwilling host, 
but circumstances have altered the 
case and it is impossible to be in our 
building for several weeks. It is as 
great a disappointment on our side 
as on the other, but the only thing 
to do is to bear it with as good grace 
as possible.
The fame of our school has spread 
abroad and many visitors come up to 
get suggestions from the several cook­
ing classes. Last week a woman in 
distress appeared and before she left 
extracted a promise from two of the 
young ladies to come and show her 
how to cook a good dinner. Needless 
to say it was the envy and delight of 
one man.
On Thursday Miss Harding took a 
very delightful class down to the In­
stitute and explained many of the 
beauties of Architectural Hall. The 
morning ended with a little im­
promptu speech by Mr. Beatty of the 
Art Gallery.
Several of the members of the night 
classes are planning to meet each 
other during the summer vacation. 
Arrangements are being made for 
week end trips to Conneaut Lake, 
Ohiopyle and other nearby resorts.
