NEW PLEBES 
ARE TO HAVE 
REGULATIONS
Freshmen Entering Second 
Semester Are to be Dis­
tinguished From Older Class 
of Plebes
NEW CAP DISCUSSED
The question of Regulations for the 
Plehes entering at the second semes­
ter has been referred by the Student 
Council to a Three School Plebe Reg­
ulation Committee. This committee 
_is composed of Science, Industries 
and Arts School men with Fritz Bow­
ers of Arts School as chairman. How­
ever, no action has been taken by 
the Committee thus far. This is the 
first year that new Plebes have been 
admitted at the beginning of the sec­
ond semester and for that reason they 
found no particular accommodations 
for themselves in the way of Plebe 
regulations.
At present they are merely under 
the same bans as the other Plebes. 
Many feel that it would be unfair to 
the older Plebes for the newer ones 
to be relieved of wearing the Plebe 
hat and blaclc tie on Qualification 
Day and also that they could not re­
ceive the full benefits to be derived 
therefrom in such a short time. Thus, 
the com'mittee is to decide what is 
best.
The committee also has two other 
problems before it. The Plebe cap as 
it now is, has not proven satisfactory, 
so a new one will be designed. An at­
tempt will also be made to change 
the regulations so that they will be 
more nearly the same in each school. 
At rresent there is a great deal of 
difference between the rules in the 
three schools which only makes 
them harder to enforce. In detail, 
however, they cannot be made the 
samfe, due to the different conditions 
existing in the three schools.
SOPH DANCE IS POSTPONED 
INDEFINITELY OWING TO LACK 
OF SUITABLE BALL ROOM
The three-school Sophomore Dance, 
which was planned to be held soon, 
has been postponed indefinitely. The 
committee found it to be impossible 
to secure a convenient ball room for 
the affair during the month of March. 
The tentative date was March 10, and 
the Hotel Schenley was preferred, but 
the ball room will be engaged on that 
night.
The most favorable time now for 
the affair will be the latter part of 
April. The committee will make every 
effort to find a favorable date, other 
arrangements for the dance already 
having been made. The Collegiate Six 
will furnish the music.
New Humorous Paper 
Appears At Carnegie
Magazine Starts as Weekly 
Publication
“Witli the publication ot this issue 
a strong compétition of the Puppet 
has entered the field," says the first 
issue of a new magazine published 
at Carnegie. The humor in this 
new paper is unexcelled and rival 
humorous magazines on the campus 
will have to work hard to maintain 
their puopularity.
Five wonderful issues have al­
ready been published, each being re­
ceived with the greatest of approval. 
Its weekly appearance is on Friday 
and a host of waiting students greet 
its arrival. The paper lias the fi­
nancial backing of the most active 
club at Carnegie and is assured of 
great success.
The« first issue came ‘ out with 
about 30 copies, which were greedily 
devoured by lucky students. Since 
that time four more issues have been 
published by request of readers of 
the first copies. The circulation has 
now increased to large numbers and 
its fame has spread west as far as 
Minnesota and as far north as New 
York.
This paper is the unofficial unau­
thorized weekly publication of stu­
dents In the Department of Printing 
and is called “The Slip-Sheet.” its 
contents consist of selections from 
the humor of future printers.
Lenten Services at Chapel
The Y. W. C. A. is co-operating

MUSICAL CLUB BACK 
FROM SECOND TRIP
Concerts Well Received at 
Every City. Second Con­
cert in Two Weeks
The Musical Clubs returned Satur­
day from a most successful concert 
trip in the northern part of this state. 
On Thursday night they were in Cor- 
ry, Pa., and Friday night a concert 
was given in Erie. This was the sec­
ond concert trip that the Musical 
Clubs have taken within the last two 
weeks. On the first trip they gave 
concerts in Orrville, Akron, Cleve­
land and Painsville. A hit was made 
in every town by the "Musical Engi­
neers” as the Erie Dispatch-Herald 
calls them. The Musical Clubs were 
made up of forty men for these trips, 
twenty men being in each club.
The thing which impressed the fel­
lows of the clubs the most on these 
trips was the wonderful entertain­
ment that they received from the peo­
ple of the towns which they visited. 
A dance was given for them in every 
place but one and at Painsville there 
were forty girls from the Lake Erie 
College for Women waiting for them 
for the dance.
Entertainment in private homes 
was given everywhere except in 
Cleveland and Corry, where they stay­
ed in hotels. At Painsville the Tech 
Novelty Orchestra played for the 
dance.
The Akron News comments as fol­
lows :
The high school auditorium was 
nearly filled last evening for the Car­
negie Musical Clubs' concert. The 
numbers given were of a varied na­
ture and all well given. From the 
opening number to the last all were 
interested and held by the changes 
of temperament presented. Outside 
of the excellent numbers rendered by 
both clubs Mr. Blackmore, the cello 
soloist, received many congratula­
tions.
The second portion of the program 
was opened by Tech’s Novelty Or­
chestra, which presented in character­
istic style all of the latest popular 
music in a series of medleys. Many 
heard sounds from the cornet and 
saxophone which were never before 
thought of. They were well assisted 
at times by Cunningham, a blackface 
bootblack from the Smokehouse.

The 5Sth annual convention of the 
Theta Xi fraternity was held in Pitts­
burgh, under the auspices of the 
Grand Lodge, and invitation of the Pi 
Chapter located at Carnegie Tech, on 
February 24 and 25. Considering 
everything the 1922 meeting was the 
biggest and best ever held to date 
by the Theta Xi national organization. 
Every chapter in the fraternity was 
represented, while there were unoffi­
cial representatives of the Theta Xi 
clubs of New York, Detroit, Chicago,

many inspection trips were arranged 
for the many visitors who wished to 
see the great industrial plants of the 
Pittsburgh district. In the afternoon, 
these trips were made. They includ­
ed trips to Heinz, Westingliouse, Col­
fax power plants, Carnegie Steel and 
the glass works.
In the evening Pi -chapter gave the 
visiting members of the fraternity 
their ogicial welcome and start on a 
good time with their smoker. Every­
thing was available at the smoker to 
make a jolly good time for all. The 
entertainment consisted of some 
clever black-face acts by Darden and 
Nesbit, imitations by Lloyd and Hed- 
lund, and a very realistic recitation 
of “The Shooting of Dan MacGrew,” 
by Lloyd, Hedlund and Nesbit. After

On February 15, 1922, Director 
Bossange of the College o£ Fine 
Arts addressed the! General Faculty 
of Carnegie Institute of Technology 
in regular session. Director Boss­
ange outilined the policies and edu­
cational problems of the College of 
Fine Arts. He pointed out the es­
sential difference in educating one 
to become an artist, an architect, a 
musician or an actor, and in train­
ing in the various colleges of Carne­
gie Tech for other fields- of activity.
He ¿tated that Carnegie Tech had 
the only complete College of Fine 
Arts In the county and that it was 
doing a pioneer work. Other schools, 
like the Engineering Department, for 
oxample, have done the greater part 
of the creative work, such is not tho 
case with tho Arts College, for It Is 
stUll in its development period and 
must not crystallize too quickly.
He said, "It ia the policy of tho 
college to produce young professional 
artists of developed individuality, 
able to practice the art for which 
they have been trained and to apply 
It to their varied problems. The 
college hopes to prepare mon and 
women not only technically but. also 
for the -career and life of the artist.
"The training in the various' de­
partments must bo continuous and 
It would not do to introduce extrane­
ous matters into the course. Tho 
student must be kept In the atmos- 
.phoro of the art». The collego thor­
oughly believes in general studies, 
but 'in order to give a sufficient 
amount of technical and gonoral 
training the various departments of. 
this college are considering to go 
on a five-year basis, or requiring ex­
aminations for entrance that practic­
ally cover the work of tho Freshman 
year.
"In order to assimiiate^roporiy cor- 
tain subjects It i& impossible for tho 
student to take them ilvo times or 
even three times a weeic. We are 
more concerned In the teaching of 
history with a problem of visualizing 
the period, and feeling deeply its 
(Continued on Page Four.)
The Senior Class, contrary to ex­
pectation, carried off the prize for 
the best stunt at the Science 'Smoker^ 
in the Union Saturday night The 
plot, revolving around F. I. Smith, 
portrayed the condition of Carnegie 
Tech as it will be in fifty years from 
now, aud it certainly was humorous, 
easily surpassing the rest of the 
stunts. The Sophs put on the second 
best, followed by the Pibbes and tho 
Juniors, whoso stunt was a minus 
quantity.
¦ The election to the Science Hall of 
Fame were as follows: Handsomest 
man, Jimmy Anderson; most lady­
like, Tiny Nesbit; champion crabber, 
Rosenblooin; biggest bluffer, Tod 
Mnessnor; brlghlest man (thinks ho 
is), Pete Thompson; laziest man, 
Skinny Slkyrm; busiest, Jack Evans; 
biggest fusser; Bob Waddell; most 
Studious, F. I. Smith; most conceited. 
Buck James; best talker, Johnny By- 
ler.
The Tau Beta PI elections wore an­
nounced, those honored being: F. II. 
Allison, E. Berglund, G. Coburn, J. R. 
Doherty, Ii. L. Griffin, H. J. McCor­
mick, E. E. Smith, G. N. Thompson.
Too much credit cannot bo given to 
tho committees who worked hard, up 
to the end of tho smoker, and espe­
cially to Tom Plante, tho chairman. 
The personnol of the commlttoo was 
A. E. Sedlachelc, P. C. Gannon and 
L. F.1 battle.
The chairman of tho various class 
committees were: Jack Cunningham, 
Senior; Chost.or Brumbaugh, Junior; 
Chas, Hollingsworth, Soph, and D. A. 
Gardner, Plobo.
Refreshments wore served undor 
difficulties and tho Plobo orchostru 
furnished the music.

Attend First Carnegie Debate
BUCKEYE CLUB MEETS, OHIO 1 
MEN SHOW YOUR INTEREST
At a meeting of tho Buckeye Club 
last Thursday a discussion was hold 
on how it could aid the Alumni Asso­
ciation. An invitation was issued 'to 
all Ohio men to attend the next meet­
ing. Last year the club was almost 
forced to disband, due to lack of in­
terest, and all Ohio men should help 
to rebuild it.
Mr. Batman addressed the club and 
expressed his willingness to aid the 
club in establishing graduate and un­
dergraduate clans in Ohio; showing 
the benpfit that it would be, not only 
to the alumni but also to the club.
Final arrangements for the first 
series of Carnegie Tech’s inter-colle­
giate debates were made last Friday 
at Beaver Falls in a conference of all 
five colleges composing the penta­
gonal Professor Peterson, coach of 
the debate squad, . represented Car­
negie at the meeting. The date for 
the first series of these debates has 
been definitely set at March 10. while 
the second series will take place a 
week later oh the evening of the sev­
enteenth. The question for discus­
sion as revised is: Resolved: That 
Congress should enact legislation 
which will give the Railroad Labor 
Board full power to enforce its deci­
sions. (Constitutionally conceded).
For the first series the Tartan af­
firmative team will meet Westmin­
ster here, while the negative trio 
will journey to Greenville and engage 
the debaters from Thiel College.
Cdach Peterson has not yet defi­
nitely announced the personnel of the 
teams which will represent Carnegie 
Tech, although Messrs. Silverman, 
Kenny, Lawrence and Whitehead are 
sure of being on the platform. Three 
of these men have had previous ex­
perience In intercollegiate debate, 
both at Carnegie and other Institu­
tions and are well qualified for the 
work they are undertaking. Several 
of the other members ot the organiza­
tion are In competition for the two re­
maining vacancies and on tho even­
ing of the first debate Tech may be 
assured of a strong representation.
A large delegation of Westminster 
alumni have promised to be on hand 
to support their team here in the first 
debate and a canvass of the o'rganiza- 
tion comprising some 500 members, 
highly active, has revealed that a 
large number will be on hand. In view 
of this fact as many as possible from 
the Institute should be present in sup­
port of the Skibo team.
Tho annual electrical banquet al 
which Prof. Wm. 11. Work wliil bo 
toastmastor, will talco placo on March 
18. Tho Sovonth Avonuo Ilotol will 
bo tho iscono of tho goL-togOthor of 
students» pursuing a course In tlio 
Eloctrlcal Department.
Judging from tho number of »in­
dent:-; onrollod In the Carnoglo Tech 
Branch ol! tho A. 1. E. E,, undor tho 
auspicos of which tho banquot VO be­
ing glvon, thoro should bo a largo 
turnout.
Last yoar’s banquet brought to- 
gothor students of till four classes 
and It Is hoped that tills year a 
larger number of Dlobos planning an 
oloctrlcal engineering course will 
take advantage of tho opportunity 
of bocomlng acquainted with elec­
trical students and tho faculty of 
that department.
Tickets will bo out within a few 
days at two dollars each and an 
oarly purchase will help tho com­
mittee in planning for the affair.

PLAID LOSES MEET 
AT JOHNS HOPKINS
Plaid Medley Makes Good 
Showing. Kelley Makes 
Good Finish
Carnegie Tech made a very good 
showing in the Johns Hopkins Invita­
tion Indoor Trade gamps, hold In 
Baltimore last Saturday. Tho meet Is 
the largest of Its kind In tho coun­
try, with something like seven hun­
dred entrants. Carnogie Tech ran 
against the Johns Hopkins Medloy 
Relay team as tho feature event of 
the meet, finishing about eight yards 
behind tho winners. John M. Kelly, 
Carnegie’s fast 100-yard man, entered 
the 100-yard event and though finish­
ing second, easily proved that ho was 
tho fastost man on tho floor in the 
dashes.
LoGondre, Georgetown, drawing a 
3-yard handicap, was tho wlnnor of 
the 100-yard event, with John M. Kel­
ly. running from scratch, finishing a 
scant foot behind, having mado up all. 
but one foot of the 3 yard handicap, 
thus clearly showing that ho was tho 
fastest man in this ovont. Tho tlmo 
of tho event was 10:2. In one of thd 
heats Kolly mado tho dlstauoo In 10 
flat.
Carnoglo lost tho fouturo Modloy 
llolay ovent to Johns Hopkins Uni­
versity. In tho 220-yard dash Lock­
wood, of Carnoglo Tooh, lost consid­
erable ground on tho turns. but gain­
ed on his man on tho straight away. 
(The track was on a flat floor, with 
tho turns unbankod). Szold, the '110- 
yard man, ran a wonderful race and 
mado up tho lost yards no that J. G. 
Kolly, In tho half-mile, started only 
about' ono yard behind the Johns 
Hopkins runner. Kolly was running 
against an expdrloneod runner* and 
although he lost a number ol’ yards, 
his tlmo was vory fast. Dylcoman, In 
tho mile, finished tho race about ton 
yards hohlnd 'Booth of Johns flop- 
kins. Booth was a fast man, as shown 
by tho fact that ho mado second placo 
In tho open mile race later In tho

CARNEGIE WINS 
SECOND GAME 
FROM W. VA.
Plaid Shows Best Brand of 
Team Work of This Year. 
Takes Early Lead Which 
is Never Overcome
DOSEY BEST SCORER
Carnegie Tech’s basket ball team 
succeeded In making it two straight 
by defeating the West Virginia squad 
last Friday night in the Tech gym, by 
the score of 37-24.
Nelson, Anderson, Dosey, Bell and 
Captain Gibson started ttye game for 
Tech and once the scoring started the 
West Virginia squad found it impos­
sible to secure the lead. Dosey scored 
tho first point of tho game by a free 
throw and Captain Gibson followed 
with a clean basket from a difficult 
angle of the court. Moran substituted 
for Andorson at forward in this halt 
and scored his first field goal soon 
after his entrance into the game. At 
the end 61! the first, half Carnoglo was 
loading by the small margin of three 
points, the score being 17-14.
Carnoglo Tech presented a differ­
ent lineup for tho second half, Moran 
jumping center, Anderson and Dosey 
playing the forward positions and 
Bell and Captain Gibson holding 
down tho guard positions. This com­
bination started tho second half with 
a rush and scored seven points before 
tho Mountaineers countod a point. 
The team work shown by tho Car­
nogie five was unquestionably tho 
best of tho soason and Moran’s play­
ing at oontor was superb. I-Ie was in 
every play and his excellent dribbling 
aocountod for many of Carnegie's 
points.
It would bo an Injustice to the other 
mon to pick out any particular man 
as tho star of tho gamo. 12vory man 
on tho squad playod oxcollont basket 
ball and tho points scored by each 
man falls to toll tho brand of ball

oosuCul affair since Its birth, last Sep­
tember. Plaoos were sot for twonty- 
IIvo guests In a private dining room 
at the Fort Pitt Hotel.
Among the guosts wore Dr. 'I'. S. 
Baker and Mr, J, W. Batman. Tho 
luncheon was served at noon.
In Ills spoopti Mr. Batman showed 
the necessity for student co-operation 
with tho alumni olilces, and how tho 
student could help his Alma Muter 
while yet a student.

CABLEGRAM DESCRIBING TRIP
The latest cablegram from Dr. and 
Mrs. Ilamerschlag announced their 
arrival after a pleasant voyage, at 
Casa Blanca, Morocco. Their Itiner­
ary, after leaving Madrid, had been 
Seville, Granada, Gibraltar, Tangier. 
From Casa Blanca they will pene­
trate a thousand miles to the Holy 
City of Marekech. The following, de­
scriptive of Che passage of the

the Paris edition of the Chicago Tri­
bune, sent by Dr. Tlarnorschlag:
"Wo received a wire loss at 5 o’clock 
one evening that the Mod was sinking 
and asking us to stand by. The 
Goorgo Washington arrived near tho 
scone at midnight, but by that time 
three or four other boats wore taking 
off tho crew and we contlnuod our 
voyage. We could not see anything.
"The George Washington encount­
ered a Btorm that lasted three dayB. 
and that lashed the waves above the 
upper decks. Several second classs 
passengers were injured when tossed 
against the heavy woodwork."
Radio Club Gets Recognition
The Student Council at their meet­
ing Sunday, February 19, took action 
on the Radio Club, and recognized it 
as an activity here at Carnegie Tech. 
The Radio Club ha& been quite active 
this school year, considerable Interest 
having been shown by the student 
body and faculty. The Student Coun­
cil has been observing the activities 
of the various organizations in the 
school, recognizing those which have 
been working, so that by thus doing, 
the organization can do bettor work.
Tho Radio Club has been holding 
regular meetings, with a membership 
of lifty-slx. Al; their meetings, sub­
jects of interest in radio work aro 
dlHcusHed by competent speakers, and 
general discussions on popular ques­
tions carried on by the' members. 
Through tho co-operation of Dean

‘THROW ’EM OUT”
The 'affair of last Tuesday evening at the Geneva basket ball 
game is regretted. This hooting of! the referee is not characteristic 
of Carnegie,, as we remember, rather, we remember Carnegie dis­
playing true sportsmanship under tiying conditions.
Basket? ball is a fast game. Fouls, generally arc due to the 
eagerness and intensity with wllick the men play. In the gym the 
viewpoint' oi/the spectators is quite different from that of the referee. 
Then, how many of those who hooted the referee, knows the rules or 
the game as well as he does. The referee is a man who has played 
basket ball, who knows basket ball and he, for this reason, is in a 
better position to call fouls.
Hooting the referee is a sign of ignorance of the game, disre­
spect for the referee’s authority and the officials who chose him and, 
finally,, it'is the most unsportsman-like thing that'can be done. It 
not only reflects on the man himself, but upon our Alma Mater and 
that is our greatest concern. t
A man may root for his team, have an intense interest in the 
game and yet not give away to such actions as occurred last Tues­
day evening. 'Wo hope"Tuesday’s affair will be the last one and if 
there are any who still persist in this practice, some good fellow grab 
him by the collar and push him through a window.

SCIENCE SOPHS HOLD
CLA8S MEETING
The first! mooting of the' Sopho- 
moron of the College (»1! Engineering 
to be held this semester, was held 
•last Tuesday, February! 21, in Room 
209. Actlng-presidont W. H. Ryan 
opened the meeting. A report ol! the 
Science Stag Smoker Committee was 
given by C. N. Holll lugs worth, chair­
man. He made an appeal l’or jokes 
and parodies to be, used on the 
evening of the smoker. The ques- 
tion of the Soph Hop was taken up, 
and1 owing to a. conllict between the 
dates on which the Schenley Hotel 
will be available, and the dates* on 
wliiohi the Collegiate Six may be se­
cured, the final date was not decided 
upon. The most likely date is Fri­
day, March 10.
C. D. Keuster and C. L. Mason 
were appointed to the Plebe Regula­
tions Committee to take the place 
of two members who have cleft scliood 
since the end of last semester.
The real reason for the class 
meeting was the nomination of of­
ficers for the present semester. The 
election will take place on Thurs­
day, March! 2, in Room 60, between 
11:30 and 1:30. Those who were 
nominated for office are as follows: 
President—

President Moody, of Middlebury 
College, says: “There are some col­
leges that turn out men more fitted 
to be chairmen of 'country club golf 
committees than anything else.’* He 
says that he does not believe in 
the prevailing system of athletics in 
American colleges. The Reverend 
Moody further asserts that Middle­
bury does not aim to graduate the 
national golf champion nor the rank­
ing tennis: player.
CARNEGIE ORGANIZATIONS 
WELL REPRESENTED
AT CONFERENCE
SUCCESS
When a student sits down and be­
wails Ills hard luck, and belittles 
the prol.'CK«ors, Ills' fe/llow students,) 
and the world generally, it is a fair i 
indication that there is - something 
wrong with him.. The fact that a; 
young mail Is .poor is no hindrance; 
on tills continent, on the contrary Itj 
has boon said that poverty is the 
finest inheritance that youth can 
have. Premier Lie yd George began 
life in very humble circumstances; 
the new Prime Minister of Japan 
was a slave. The heads of many of 
the great railways and financial 
houses started as poor boys, who 
worked hard by day, and studied by 
night, A news agent became the 
electrical wizard; one of our western 
senators was a Barnardo* boy. Count­
less others too' numerous to mention, 
starting on the lowesL rung on the 
ladder of success, achieved greatness.
Knowledge, force, ambition, imag­
ination'. and Integrity are the vital 
dlemonts tof success. Knowledge of 
the right kind, and in abundance Is 
available at McGill, and It Is our 
fault If we do not assimilate it. We 
can at least procure that factor of 
success1 right in the university. Force 
is a combination of Industry, concen­
tration and personality, and enables 
us to utilize our knowledge, and to 
carry out our ambition. AlmoBt all 
the great leaders of the world were 
practiced1 dreamers. Without imagin 
atioiii America would yot be undis­
covered, and we would still be liv­
ing in the "Dark Ages." Integrity, 
the last named, but not the least, 
Is imperative to true success.
Honesty and good habits are as 
essential as any other of the de­
sired characteristics, and one can­
not bo termed really successful With­
out these.
Evory student possesses at loast 
one of these, and many others may 
bo lying dormant, waiting to be 
aroused. A real young man cannot 
be kept down In Canada or any­
where else; the demand for men 
of worth is ever increasing.—McGill 
Daily.
ROAMIN’S
HINDU MEETING AT Y. W.
A special series of meetings, under 
the supervision of Helen Lewis, World 
Fellowship chairman, is on the Y. W. 
meetings calendar. The plan is to

customs of different countries, notic­
ing especially the girls of college age, 
and compare them with the Ideal Girl 
iiB defined at a previous meeting of 
the series.
On Wednesday of this week, at 
-I:.'HI, the Hindu mooting will bo held 
in the Assombly Hall. This promisos 
to ho a Very Interesting meeting, as 
one of the students from India will 
show slldoB and talk on his own coun­
try.
GIRLS' INTER-DORM DANCE
March 18th has boon sot as the 
dato for the annual girls’ Inter-dorm 
dance. Every one who attended last 
year will want to go this yoar—as 
well as those who'vo never boon! 
Tickets will bo on sale soon In the 
different, houses.
TEA AT P. C. W.
Tho Y. W. of tho Pennsylvania Col­
lege for Women re coivo d tho mom- 
born of tho Carneglo Tech Y. W. at 
tea on Friday afternoon. Each P. ( 
W. girl had her name on a tag, and 
mot as many Margaret Morrison girls 
as possible.
Ton mdn and women students rep­
resenting the Tech Y. M. C. A, 
Toknon Club, and Y. W. C. A., at­
tended the Student Missionary 'Con­
ference, hold at Washington and 
Jefferson College on Friday, February 
17, to the following Sunday, Sprinkle, 
Hoover, Phil Mayer and Biddle were 
the men, and Miss Martha Colegrove, 
Miss' Mary Crawford, Miss Edna 
Howard. Miss Anna Kirker. Miss 
Winifred] Rice and Miss Eleanor 
Wilt completed the delegation.
The Gvent was the annual confer­
ence of delegates from sixteen West­
ern Pennsylvania colleges1 having 
students interested' in the Student 
Volunteer Movement. Speakers were 
Dr. Baker, president of W. and J., 
Mr. E. Fay Campbeill of the National 
Headquarters of the Student Volun­
teer Movement, Rev. Rex.’ Wheeler, 
who talked on missionary work in 
India, and Dr. MoLanalian, who ex­
hibited slides and gave a talk on 
Egypt.
Tho delegates were entertained 
and banquetod by tho First M. E. 
Church and the Third Presbyterian 
Chnrclv, and by residents of Wash­
ington. Tho conference was of 
groat interest, and the delegates 
had a profitable and onjoyablo trip.

times ami good athletics are dosirublo 
at tho mime time.
"As tho progros of the United 
States deponds on high thinking, so 
tho success of Curnogio Tech depends 
on scholastic achievement.
"Such an organization as tho Mid- 
Week Association promotes good fool­
ing and has much practical value. 1 
am happy to have beon with you to­
day.”
Following the speeches a short bus­
iness meeting was held. Mr. Lundy 
was elected president of the organiza­
tion following the resignation of II. C. 
Bamberger. Plans for a smoker to 
be held in March were discussed.
A theater party followed the lunch­
eon and a very enjoyable holiday was 
ended.
STRINGERS PLAY
AT WESTING HO USE
So famous are,' tho Stringers becom­
ing that they have been asked again 
to play for Radio Broadcasting Sta­
tion at tho Westinghouse. On Thurs­
day night they again journeyed to 
East Pittsburgh and gave a concert 
for tho "wide world." Some have 
been inclined to doubt the fact that 
the king of the Zulu Isles asked them 
to repeat "Everybody Step”—but any­
way, somebody did!
PRACTICE HOUSE TEA
On Wednesday afternoon the 
Household Economics Faculty gave a 
tea at the Practice House in honor 
of Mrs. Mudge, lecturer on “Nutriti- 
tion,” to the Public Health Nurses in 
convention here.
Miss Ege, ’19, and Miss 1-Iays, ’21, 
poured, and were assisted in serving 
by Miss English, Miss Weber and 
Miss Keefer. This was one of the 
most enjoyable teas ever given on the 
campus, according to members of the 
department who were in attendance.
MUSICAL CLUBS BACK
FROM EXTENSIVE TRIP
(Continued From Page One.) 
gond of tho Chimes was well render­
ed. Tho quartette attempted and suc­
ceeded in reaching that degree of in­
formality which brings singer and 
listeners together. Their selections 
wore very froely and pleasingly ron- 
dored.
Mr. Kovaclc’s solo with club accom­
paniment made Schubert’s Soronado 
appeal to all, though it was rendered 
in a slightly different score than 
usual.
Tho now high school auditorium 
with its conveniences and attractive­
ness, tho Tech chair covers and ban­
ners. and the pleasing appearance of 
formal dress, made the cqncert ono 
of beauty in appearance as well as in 
talent.

want a real stiff drink, there’s noth­
ing like embalming fluid.”—The Tar-,

flakes!”
Alton: “Practicing for the snow­
ball, I suppose.”
“LEARNED LADIES”
AND "DON JUAN"
Please accept our criticism of 
"Learned Ladies” and "Don Juan.” 
We understand that there has been 
some discussion about our criticism 
and its sincerity and we wish to state 
that our aim has not been merely to 
find fault with the plays and the ac­
tors, but to point out the essential 
difficulties which seem to be encount­
ered by both producer and actor—dif­
ficulties which are apparent to the 
audience around us and to ourselves, 
but which may not appear at all clear­
ly to those more closely connected 
with the production. And so, if at 
times we seem harsh and inconsider­
ate, it is because we think by taking 
the attitude we do, we can point out 
more effectively those short-comings 
which would otherwise be overlooked. 
This 'merely by way of explanation— 
to return to our subject.
In this ago of musical comely, 
problem play and jazz it is refresh­
ing and exhilarating to witness two 
productions such as those given last 
week at the Arts Theater. The Com­
edy of Mollere has a nniversai and 
ageless appeal—it is still as enjoy­
able as it was in his day, and is far 
less transient than our modern type 
of entertainment is bound to be. As 
to which of the two plhys we enjoyed 
the more, that is difficult to say. Com­
parisons are always odious and in 
tills case the two plays are of such 
different type that there are few 
points upon which to compare them. 
"The Learned Ladies” admittedly ap­
peals to a higher type of apprecia­
tion of humor—its lines are at least 
as important as ’ its action, if not 
more so; while in “Don Juan” there 
is a good deal of action which is 
funny without being dependent upon 
the written play itself. Particular act­
ing honoi'B for either play do not 
fall upon any ono member of the cast, 
as the parts were all very well bal­
anced. There are only a very few ex­
ceptions in both.
Mr. Hertz as Scanarelle in "Don 
Juan” was exceedingly funny and at 
times his comedy was quite subtle. 
This was by far his best work we 
have seen. By way of criticism we 
would like to suggest that this young 
actor learn to control both his play­
ing and his personal feelings. We 
have yet to see him so submerge him­
self in his character that he gave an 
illusion of being unconscious of his 
own ridiculous appearance, the one 
thing a comedian must cultivate. He 
would do well to play less to the au­
dience and more for the audience.
It is very unfortunate that Mr. Wil­
lard, who no doubt can do fine things 
in parts suited to him, should be con­
tinually cast in parts unsuited to his 
abilities. Wo do not know whether he 
or the directors are to blame; but to 
us, to whom tho character of Don 
Juan lias a special significance, his 
performance lacked everything ex­
cept the touches of hypocrisy that
our romantic heart-breaker should 
have. Again let us remind him of his 
walk. Is there no class for stage bear­
ing and deportment? If not, there
should be—it is ail unfortunate lack.
One of the most delightful sqenes 
in tho show was the second, and most 
picturesque and suitable In their parts 
were Miss Lowe, Mr. Lazarus and 
Miss Skurkay. Their work was most 
pleasing, although tho situation was 
undeniably far-fetched and unconvinc­
ing. As to tho two brothers, Mr. 
Kappes was as good as Mr. Szold was 
bad —which V. saying a groat deal for 
Mr. ICappes. Miss Gray as Donna El- 
vlro, was very appealing and . charm­
ing, but at tlmos most colorless. Mr. 
MoAteer as tho tailor, did a vory good 
bit of work and Mr. Lubln invested 
the statue with both tho looks and 
tho bearing of a Roman emperor. It 
was interesting to note tho effect of 
the appearance of this character upon 
the audience. Tho nervous titter 
which is drawn from even the most 
blase assombly by tho embodiment of 
a supernatural idea is amusing. Would 
it not be more effective to allow the 
audience to witness the sword play, 
of which, wp hoar such unconvincing 
clatter off stage?
The settings in the interiors and 
tho forest scenes were very convinc­
ing arid appropriate, but the second 
and fifth lacked a great deal both in 
gfehOral construction and in lighting.
As to "The Learned Ladies/'’ Mr. 
Paquin as Chrysale was quite fine, 
though remembering; back to laSt 
year not up to his 'work in "When 
the Devil Was 111/’ His handling of 
broad comedy is only marred by a 
tendency to allow his voice to get into 
weaker upper ranges. Miss Floyd, as 
Belise was most finished in her com­
edy and made us enjoy every one of 
her scenes. Her little laughs and 
sighs, whether a part of herself or 
not, were most amusing. The scene 
where she listened in at the two men 
talkifig was a little too overdrawn to 
seem real. Trissotin as Mr. Caldwell 
played him, was most interesting. 
His-movements and postures for the 
whole were quite good, quite a la 
Wilde, but his voice never fitted into 
the characterization. By the way of 
criticism Mr. Caldwell made it evi­
dent that while lie might be able to 
similate lovo lie,never could feel it~ 
a little practice' might help. Miss 
Kaufman was very pleasing as a 
modern ingenue in a Molioro play, 
and the Missos Osborno and Dico did 
all in their power to make thomselvos 
seem stilted, learned and as Impos­
sible as was able, which was what 
the parts required. AM throe good' 
portrayals ot throo types of women. 
It’s quite refreshing to see Mr. Reid 
in a part other than that; of tho dash­
ing juvenile. His mannerisms were 
quite in period. Mr. Viehman in his 
small part, was interesting and thor­
oughly in' character except for his 
glasses, In this respect both lie and 
Mr. Malloy were quite anachronistic. 
Though Miss Cohen’s lisp interfered 
with her speech, her Martine was 
vital. We understand that Mr. Beyer 
is an accomplished playwright.
To the production, some of the 
movements and business seemed use­
less and out of place. At times it 
seemed that everybody was moving 
with no object excep.t just to move.
One small defect. Caused the
wreck of the Roma. One unkind 
word. Has split many a life long 
friendship. Do you men. Who say 
you represent Carnegie Tech. Know 
that your exhibition of. Booing and 
hissing. At the game last Tuesday 
evening. Could have blackened the 
record of Carnegie. For a long time 
to come. Do you ever stop to think. 
That there are newspaper men pres- 
-ent. Who could spread that news far
and, wide. In the twinkle of an eye.
And with one stroke of the pen. Do
you want the record of Carnegie be­
smirched. Throughout the City of 
Pittsburgh?
When your team is far behind. 
That’s not the time to leave them. 
To chide the referee. You deny the 
ability of the men in charge. To pick 
a competent official. And Daugherty 
is far too experienced. And too 
square to deserve* the stigma. That 
was placed on him Tuesday night.
The large delegation. Which came 
along with the team. Must have car­
ried a beautiful story. To their 
friends back at Beaver Falls. Stop 
and think of .these things. When 
you’re anxious. For • your team to 
come to the fore. Resolve to lose 
like a gentleman Or take your hat 
off tlie rack in our hall.

years a man who was not highly

A record in mileage was established 
when Washington and Jefferson’s

9,000 miles during the 1921 season. 
The biggest part of this was due to 
tho California trip, which was 6,300

GET TO finNGPOUS-Tho Carnegie Tech Freshman bas­
ket ball team traveled to Bellevue last 
Tuesday night and was defeated by 
Bellevue High School in what was 
said to bo the best and hardest fought 
game seen there in some time. Tho 
final score, 31-2S, shows the closeness 
of tho game—tho only reason Belle­
vue won is that time just happened to 
be up when they had a three-point 
lead, as the score see-sawed back and 
forth throughout the game, first. Belle­
vue and then the Freshmen holding 
tho lead.
Every man that played put up a 
sterling game with Matter and Park 
showing best for the Plebes, while 
Parker, the, Bellovuo Captain, was 
right in the gamo. Ho was responsible 
for 10 of his team’s points, and his 
floor work cannot bo overrated.
Last Saturday night on tho West- 
inghouso Tech floor tho Freshmen 
lost to that team by tho score of 32-10.
Inability to cage baskets both by 
the free route and otherwise, together 
with the ability o[ Westingliouse 
Tech to . do same, contributed to tho 
Freshmen defeat. Good guarding by 
tho Westinghouso Tech players also 
tended largely to provout tho Plebe 
score mounting.
Campbell, from a scoring stand­
point, was the outstanding star of 
Westinghouso with 21 out of their 33 
points. Friend also put up a good 
exhibition with four field goals. Mat­
ter of Tech, did all of1 the Freshmen 
scoring with tho solo exception of ono 
field goul by Murray.

will play a return game with tho 
Girls’ Varsity of Westminster Collego 
Friday afternoon at 4:30 p. m. This 
game will be their final gamo of the 
season and will be a good gamo. This, 
because of tho i'act that tho West­
minster Klrls boast of a really good 
team. They are coached by a man 
who knows tho girls’ gamo. They 
have played through a vory oxtonBlvo 
and intensive schedule oC two games a 
week for practically twolvo wooks. 
They have to their credit .victories 
over Thiol, twice; Genova twice; Car­
negie Tech onco, and many others.
Tho game last wook ornlod In a 22-

negie Tech girls played a good gamo 
with good team work artd Kood pnsa

were kept to tho minimum. Tho three 
field goals that wort) made wore duo 
to Helen «Rood and Isabel Winner, 
two going to Miss Winner. Miss Alex­

Tho "Magglo Murphs and Arts” are 
In a fighting mood and will put up

oxpoct to put ncross a victory. They 
may do this, but if they don't tho

INTER-FRATERNITY DORMITORY BASKET BALL
Have you been watching those fast games boing played evory wook In 
the Langley Lab? Also have you noticed the standings of tho Loaguos? 
Somo good games are in lino just at present among the teams lighting for 
tho leadership. Individual stars are breaking Into the limolight and it is 
said that some have been trying out for tho varsity. This Is ono of tho 
chief alms of Inter-fraternity baskot ball: to develop mon for tho varsity 
squad. Asido from that it givos more men a chapco to play baskot ball 
and tends to arouse friendly spirit and rivalry among tho l'ratornltles and 
dormitories.
The eligibility of men for tho'teams has always boon a point of much 
discussion and trouble. There are rules providing for oliglblllty but tho 
writer has observed those rules In practice and found that thoy are entirely 
inadequate. Instead of trying to abide by the rulos and tho spirit with which 
they were made, the tendency in many casos is to try to got around those 
regulations In every way possible. It would bo woll to have’ tin oliglblllty 
committee appointed to draw up a sot of rules covering evory possible phase 
of the matter. This should be dono In preparation for next year.
Just as a suggestion, why shouldn't tho coach of basket ball attend some 
of the games of' tho Loaguo and be on the lookout for now material? It Is 
a fact that somo good mon aro lost to tho varsity squad In that they don’t 
realize their ability or havon’t had the opportunity of a fair trial.

That tho Faculty of tho Ohio Htato

be used by tho faculty during tho 
coming winter. .
AS FOR
Cheering, there is room for improvement—both In tho student body and 
In tho cheerleaders. Another thing, most of tho Tech yolls are rather long 
for baskot ball. The new one Introduced at the last game Is short and 
snappy, just the thing to slip in when thoro Is "time out” or between 
quarters.
The cheerleader's class is tho right stuff. Now is tho time to start on 
that crop of men for the big football games next fall. Lot’s luivo a good at­
tendance at every Tuesday afternoon session!Here is the first attribute 
of a citizen of the world.

ANOTHER START
With two victories and one defeat for last weok. If tho team can pull 
through the last two games and the girls help out we might approach that 
"Sixteen Consecutive Victories” with tennis and baseball coming on. Every­
body out and support the team on these last two home games. The pros­
pects'are good with two new men on the squad who are showing some real 
basket ball.

utes of the last meeting were read 
and approved.
STANDING COMMITTEES
The Stationery Committee submit­
ted samples, one of which was reg­
ularly adopted as the official station­
ery of the federation. The Gymnasi­
um Committee had no report except 
that the Park site under considera­
tion for the gymnasium is not avail­
able. Mr. Tilbrook reported for 
clans and gave notice of the third 
annual meeting of the New York 
Clan for Saturday, February 25.
The Publication Committee was not 
prepared to make a report at this 
time.
NEW BUSINESS
It was regularly moved and sec­
onded that a Campus Week Commit­
tee of not less than five members 
should be appointed by the president. 
On motion it was voted to have a 
Federation luncheon during Campus 
Week instead of the banquet. Mr. 
LittCe’s proposition to have the office 
of president filled by rotation was 
discussed. On motion it was decid­
ed that’ a nominating committee 
should be selected at the meeting 
preceding the annual election, this 
committee to consist of one mem­
ber of eacln association and charged 
with the duty of suggesting suitable 
candidates, for the various offices of

ly. proved to be the fastest man in 
the dashes on the floor Is especially 
pleasing. The showing of J. G. Kel­

of experience should develop into a 
successful distance man. Dylceman, 
Szold and Lockwood each showed up 
well. Dykeman ran a good race 
agains one of the fastest milers in 
the meet. Szold proved that he was 
better than the Johns Hopkins 440-

Has it ever occurred to you as 
you struggled through a lecture in 
209 Science or Room 10 or 11, Ma­
chinery Hall, trying to keep awake 
that perhaps there was some reason 
other than late hours responsible for 
your drowsiness? Hardly a lecture 
passes by but that the Prof. is com­
pelled to stap in the course of his 
talk and announce to the students 
that some one is sleeping in the 
rear of the room. Hardly a one of 
us has not at one time or another 
dozed off to sleep only to be awak­
ened by the dismissal bell.
The real reason and the real 
source of the fault is not with 
the students. It lies with the par­
ties responsible for conditions exist­
ing In the buildings about the camp­
us. The fault dies in the ventilating 
system. One cannot help but sleep when 
placed with many other individuals 
in a room hampered by lack of fresh 
air. A great deal of the good de­
rived from lectures is being lost to 
Iho earnest student on account of 
an improper ventilating system. 
Let’s hope that the proper authori­
ties make an effort to give us a 
little fresh- air in our class rooms.
Students, to get a reliable fountain 
pen, Eversharp pencil, "Tech" recog­
nition or seal pin, brief case, school

In all there were about two hun­
dred guests crowded In the room of 
Pi chapter house. These interming­
led with one another, meeting old 
pals of school days, and working their 
hands and elbows like unto a piston 
rod, making, at least, an honest at­
tempt to give the grip to their good 
pals of old.
Saturday afternoon the convention 
proper was held in the Blue Room of 
the William Penn Hotel. Much im­
portant business was transacted, and 
many good suggestions given. New 
charters were granted to the Omega 
Lambda local of Armour Institute of 
Technology In Chicago, and to the PI 
PI Rho local of the University of Illi­
nois, the installation to take place In 
the near future. Detroit was chosen 
as the place of meeting for 1923.
,In the evening, the annual formal 
banquet was held in the Blue Room 
of the William Penn Hotel. There 
were about two hundred Theta Xl’s 
present, all of whom entered into the 
final event of a wonderful convention 
with a jolly good spirit.
The speakers of the evening were 
Prof. H. S. Hower of Carnegie Tech, 
R. T. Skinner, Jr., of Indianapolis, 
Hugh T. Wreaks of Detroit and Judge 
S. E. Hoyt of New Haven, Connecti­
cut. F. R. Cogswell, an alumnus of

"Intensive work without set hours 
is often necessary for the artist and 
dramatist. During the first weeks 
of a six week problem the student 
slowly assimilates Uie conditions and 
gradually a solution, interpretation 
or characterization and then gradual­
ly all his efforts focus on the final 
production and that is reached at a 
moment of intensified effort and pro- 
duces a climax in his educational ex­
perience.
"The greatest problem of the Art 
College Is the development of the in­
dividual, everything else is second- 
adry. A man cannot be an artist 
from 9 a. in. to 5 p. in., but he must 
¡be an artist for 24 hours a day. HLsv 
art expresses Ms wnoie self. The 
solutions for our problems are all 
different "and uniformity of procedure 
or results wouild kill the Initiatives. 
You cannot standarize art. Uniform­
ity is , good when the purpose is 
quantity production of a standard 
article but when the aim is quality 
and not quantity and all products 
are different, uniformity (becomes 
impossible.
"The arts teacher’s province is to 
inspire and to get the student to 
see the spirit of the subject in con­
sideration and to lift him up into 
those mysterious regions where beau­
ty reigns. And when once the stu­
dent has seen the spirit within he 
has iTie material to interpret the 
spirit to others.
“We cannot conceive a civilization 
without art. Let us produce it our 
selves instead of importing it. 
Therefore we American Art Schools 
must supply this need.”
Long applause followed the talk 
showing the appreciation of Director 
Bossange’s address. It was generally 
admitted that the talk was one of 
the very best ever given at any 
faculty meeting on the campus. Di­
rector Bossange has every desire to 
convey his Idea of the value of an 
art school to everyone on the camp­
us, thereby bringing the other col­
leges of Carnegie Tech In closer con­
tact with it.

BILL PFOUTS TALKS
AT YOUNGSTOWN
Youngstown Clan held their regu­
lar monthly meeting Monday, Feb­
ruary 20, at tho local Y. M. C. A.
After thd regular business had 
been transacted Wm. Pfouta of tho 
College of Industry, gave us one of 
tho most Interesting, AIR well as en-1 
tertalning talks that it has been our I 
privilege to llston to. He covered
the early history of the school, and 
also gavo us . some Information on 
the finances and athletics of the 
school, that was a revelation to 
ftiost of us. All those who are ao 
qalnted with "Bill," can appreciate 
how Intorestlng ho can make any 
subject. If any of tho other clans 
wish to hear an instructive taJlk on 
»cliool affairs, Youngstown Clan 
heartily recommends Pfouts.
It was the unanimous opinion of- 
the clan that we had received much 
more from “Tech" than we have 
given, and in order to express our 
appreciation of the teachers at 
"Tech,” who had given their best for 
us, it was moved and seconded that 
they be given a public notice of this 
appreciation.
Tho meeting then adjourned to 
our regular get-together which has 
turned out to be one of the most 
papular features of our moetlngs.
The next meeting will be held 
March 20, at tho Y. M. C. A., and 
we want all tho "Tech” men in tills 
district, to mark the third Monday 
of each month as "Tech” day and 
make a special effort to be with us.
The following is a list of names 
of those who attended the meeting;
