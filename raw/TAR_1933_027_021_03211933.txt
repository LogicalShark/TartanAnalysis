Graduate Writes 
To Prof. Work
Professor Work of the Depart­
ment of Electrical Engineering has 
recently received a letter from 
M. Hirai ’16, a graduate of that 
department, now working in Japan.
Mr. Hirai, chief engineer of the 
Yuasa Storage Battery Company, 
Osaka, Japan, reports in his letter 
that Japan is facing the same eco­
nomic troubles that we are. To 
improve their conditions, the Ja­
panese have placed an embargo on 
gold, and they have inflated the 
¦currency of the country to a large 
extent. The result is that the 
Yuasa Storage Battery Company 
has made more money in the last 
\.six months than they have ever 
3\iade before in the same period, 
.. hifii the profits have been very 
^md.11 because of the inflation of 
currency and the high prices of 
me :rial.

meeting the needs of the entire 
student body in any helpful or 
practical way. Its aim is remain 
representative of the various re­
ligious denominations on campus, 
doing all it can to get new stu­
dents in touch with their own 
churches.
Such activities as those during 
Freslnnan week, social servico, 
check cashing, and radio servico 
in hospitals have been under the 
work of the Y. M. C.#A.
One of its early actlvties was 
the sponsoring and promoting of 
interfraternity basket ball, until 
the activity became so expanded 
that’ it was taken over by the 
Physical Training Department.

partment of Electrical Engineering, 
is chairman of the committee for 
the celebration dinner. He is as­
sisted by Dean Tarbell, Alan 
Blight, John Ladd, and Mr. Davis.

CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
BY STANTON WILLIAMS
Prof. William R. Work, head of 
the Department of Electrical En­
gineering and closely connected 
with the development of Carnegie 
since its founding, was born at 
Steelton, Pa., and received Ills 
early education In Springfield, 
Ohio. He was graduated from 
•Wittenberg College In 1902 with 
an A. B. degree, and received Ills 
M. E. degree In Electrical Engi­
neering In 1905 from Ohio State 
University
During the following year Pro­
fessor Work did research work at 
Westinghouse, meanwhile teach­
ing mathematics in night school at 
Carnegie. In 1906 he Joined the 
staff of the Department of Electric­
al Engineering and became its 
head In 1924. His stay here was 
interrupted In 1918 when he was 
granted a leave of absence to bo 
Technical Expert on the war-time 
Committee on Education and Spe­
cial Training. A large consulting 
practice involving research on liti­
gation has engaged much of Ills 
time. He has made contributions 
to the A. I. E. E. Journal.
Professor Work is a member of 
the American Institute of Electrical 
Engineers, the Engineering Society
of Western Pennsylvania, the So­
ciety for Promotion of Engineering 
Education, the American Associa­
tion of University Professors, and 
Is a fellow in the American Asso­
ciation for the Advancement of 
Science. Ills fraternity affiliations 
are Beta Theta PI, Sigma XI, Tau 
Beta PI, and Eta Kappa Nu.
During his school days at Witten­
berg, Professor Work was a mem­
ber of the tennis team; later, as a 
memiber of the faculty here, he en­
gaged In a baseball game with the 
students In which the students 
were soundly trounced The hobby 
about which he Is particularly en­
thusiastic at present Is contract 
bridge. He likes to spend Ills va­
cations motoring.
Interesting reminiscences 
brought out the fact that in the 
early days evening dross was al­
ways worn at social affairs at 
which ladles were present, and 
that It was quite all right to go to 
these functions in street cars, to at­
tired, carrying bags containing 
dancing pumps. Another is that 
the circular court in front of Mar­
garet Morrison was originally a 
roadway to_accommodate carriages 
which were still being used at the 
time the college was built.

School Buys Property; 
Final Plans Indefinite
No definite plans havo been 
mado yet about tho BiWn resi­
dence which was recently taken 
over by the school. Tho Institu­
tion had an option for some time 
on the property which Is situated 
on the hill overlooking the cut and 
Margaret Morrison College.
At present the Department of 
Drama is holding evening classes 
in the residence. Some members 
of the institution are in favor of 
moving the Department of Music 
into the building. Others advocate 
using it for a girls’ dormitory to 
replace the small dormitories on

mission price to the Swing is

Committee Makes 
New Probation Rule
The following rules have been 
adopted by the Curriculum Com­
mittee of the College of Engi­
neering at the mid-semester pe­
riod in April.
“A student whose class stand­
ing is very unsatisfactory will 
be warned by the Director, and 
a copy of the warning will be 
sont to the parents. If, one-half 
semester-after warning his 
standing is still unsatisfactory, 
he will be placed on probation, 
and the parents will also be no­
tified of this action. If, at the 
next semester-ending, his stand­
ing is still unsatisfactory, the 
student will bo suspended."
Dept, of Arcli. 
Introduces New 
Teaching Method
Tho Department of Architecture 
lma Instituted a now system of In­
struction In connection with tho 
courso In Water Color, basod on 
tho theory dovolopod by Prof. Kim- 
rod McLoary with tho assistance or 
Mr. Robert Selnnortz.
The now method provldos for 
tho uso of a number of blocks 
from which compositions are 
made; these the students use as 
modola. Tho purpose of this sys­
tem Is to Impart Lo tho student u 
koonor comprohonslon of architec­
tural forms by showing him how 
they build, fit together and com­
pose In mass. It Is also Intended 
to gel. tho student more used to 
visualizing forms In threo dimen­
sions so as to give him a hotter 
grasp of tho fundamentals of arch­
itectural form and composition. 
Tho student selects his own com­
position as ho would an outdoor 
landscape and does his water 
color using blocks as models. Al­
most any architectural style can be 
Indicated by tho blocks, tho funda­
mentals of thoso various styles be­
ing more readily observed in 
model form.
The new system, which lias been 
In existence about a month, has 
proved very convenient for both 
instructor and student. It takes 
only a short time for the Instructor 
to erect any type of building he 
wants the students to paint. To 
date a mediaeval castle, a classic 
ruin and buildings similar to the 
ones which will be featured at the 
World’s Fair have been built.

For those who are interested in 
developing their swimming prowess 
beyond the average degree we 
make the announcement that in­
struction is being offered by Mr. 
Moses in the regular*swimming 
classes, and also every Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday, from five 
to six o'clock, by Messrs. Rise- 
dorph and Ackley. This instruc­
tion is towards fulfilling the re­
quirements for qualification in the 
Red Cross life saving examination. 
Specifically, the requirements 
asked of those who wish to qualify 
for the Senior Red Cross test are 
six hours of supervised instruction, 
and ability of the candidate to 
swim 440 yards, or one-fourth of a 
mile.
All men who wish to qualify as 
senior examiners are urged to be­
gin practice at the earliest moment 
possible, in order to be prepared 
for the exam, which will be given 
by the Captain of the Red Cross 
Life Saving unit of this district 
during' the first two weeks in 
April.
All Freshmen and Sophomores 
who are interested in coming 
out for Track manager should 
do so at once. They may re­
port to either Milton Dinger or 
Manager Bronson at the Field 
House. This is an excellent op­
portunity for the Freshmen to 
gain an activity, as well as the 
association with many of the 
other students. A Carnegie 
sweater with a major C is 
awarded to both the Varsity 
and Freshman manager.
One of the surprising features of 
the coming spring athletic program 
was the marked interest shown in 
the desire upon the part of the stu­
dents to form a golf team. In re­
sponse to an obscure notice posted 
by Joel Haverstick, more than thir­
ty enthusiastic divot-diggers put in 
appearance at the Trophy Room 
last week and laid plans for the 
coming season.
Whether or not Carnegie will 
have an official golf team rest sole­
ly with the Athletic Council, and if 
such a team is formed, matches 
will be held chiefly with local op­
ponents.
Last year the attempt to organ­
ize a team started too late in the 
season to accomplish much. How- 
/ever. several informal matches 
were played with Haverstick, Fer­
gus; Carson, Burgoyne and others 
turning in favorable scores.

College Career
BY JOE BRONSON
Last Wednesday night the Kappa 
Sign nosed out the T. X's by two 
points to claim the championship 
of the National League. The game 
was a thriller with the outcome in 
doubt to the very end, both teams 
playing the best brand yet seen in 
the league. There is just an out­
side chance that the Kappa Sigs 
will be tied for the league should 
they lose their next game.
The Alpha Sigs definitely 
clinched the cup for the American 
League when they won from the 
Sigma Nus with only one game yet 
to play they are two games ahead 
the Pi K. —CH who hold second place, 
Unless the Betas drop one to the 
I cellar team in their league. The 
! are champs of their leiigue. The 
Senior Architects have been piling 
up sizeable scores but they have 
been unable to get rid of that one 
game on the wrong side of the 
record.

Entries for the intramural swim­
ming contests must be handed in 
by 4:30 Friday, March 24. This is 
the final announcement to this 
effect that will be issued before 
the entries are closed. The meets 
will be held April 3, 5, and 7, with 
the finals April 10. Entries must 
be turned in promptly to enable 
early drawing of the schedule of 
meets.
Eligibility rules for the intra­
mural swim state that it is open 
to all registered day students who 
have not won points in either 
plebe or varsity competition dur­
ing the past season, or those who 
have won their varsity letters in 
any previous college swimming 
competition. The freshmen who 
have won points toward their 
numerals, although their team is 
not in the usual sense official, are 
also excluded from competition.
The meets will be run as a 
series of three preliminaries, from 
which the winners of first and sec­
ond places in each event will 
qualify for the final. The scoring 
will be cumulative in that points 
won in the preliminary meets, to 
the fourth place, will count to­
wards filial scoring* for the cham­
pionship. As in the past, a much 
cherished cup -will be awarded to 
the team scoring the most points.
Intramural wrestling will begin 
next Monday, March 27, and will 
continue until March 31. This is 
the second year of this type of 
competition on the Tartan campus. 
Wrestling is being met with a 
growing interest in many colleges 
of the country, and it is hoped that 
it will be made a permanent sport 
In the intramural competition.
The schedule for the mat 
matches may be obtained in the 
office of Mr. Risedorph, in the gym­
nasium.
Carnegie Tech’s luckless court 
squad brought its season to a some­
what dismal conclusion over at the 
Pitt Stadium Pavillion last Friday 
p. m. Dr. Carlson’s highly touted 
squad took the final encounter of 
the season for both teams without 
the slightest difficulty, 38-21.
The game was anybody’s battle 
in the first half, the lead changing 
hands frequently. A long fling that 
clipped the loop and a rather 
dubious foul gave the Panthers a 
17-13 margin at the half-time mark, 
and after that they were never 
headed. The Slcibos seemed to 
miss their offensive star, Bobbie 
Smith, who was out with a 
'«/ranched shoulder, and when 
Jagnow was injured early in the 
second half, they appeared to lose 
all heart. Brilliant performances 
by “Swede” Carlson and Jimmy 
Fergus were all that saved the 
game from being a rout.
It was the final performance in a 
Plaid uniform for Smith, Fergus, 
Stentz, and Siegal. Bobbie Smith 
was forced to witness the game 
from the sidelines and consequent­
ly saw his chances for the confer­
ence scoring title go glimmering. 
It must be said for Fergus that he 
played a wonderful game at a time 
when his team mates were having 
one sad night as far as perform­
ance goes.
A small but enthusiastic crowd 
gave Pitt’s Don Smith and Carne­
gie’s Bob Smith a .rousing ovation 
as they left the floor shortly be­
fore the end of the game. Bob 
Smith played for a few minutes, 
but he could raise only one arm. 
The Pitt captain played a brilliant 
game throughout.
Promising Freshmen and 
Varsity Candidates 
Answer Call
With the coming of another 
spring the eyes of collegiate sport- 
dom are slowly turning from the 
tank and court to the cinder track. 
Here at Carnegie activities have 
already begun toward getting the 
track and the tracksters into snape 
for the opening meet, less than a 
month away. Most of the hold­
overs from last year’s squad and 
many of the present sophomores 
have been hard at it for the past 
few weeks and are ready to "cut 
loose” when the track permits.
Among those who will be missed 
considerably when the season gets 
under way are Armentrout, Blaine 
and Brindel in the weights; Bar­
ger and Merten, who handled the 
jumping and vaulting; and Sig­
mund and Price from the cinder 
section.
From last year’s Plebe team 
conies Perina, a sprinter, and 
Burke, a half miler. Allen, Brown 
and -De Witt are other sophomores 
who should prove a big help to the 
varsity. McCurdy and Lampher 
return to the track after a year’s 
absence and will also boster the 
forces considerably.
Freshman track will, as usual, be 
an important part of the spring 
athletic curriculum. A very prom­
ising squad of freshmen turned out 
the first day and any others who 
are interested should report for 
equipment immediately.

A large packing case is exhibited on a raised plat­
form. A young woman climbs into the box. Head, 
hands and feet protrude, and are held by specta­
tors while the magician takes a crosscut saw and, 
with the help of an assistant, saws through the

WASHINGTON CLAN
After the Georgetown-Carnegie 
basketball game the clan held a 
party at the Michel Club. The an­
nual Clan Day meeting is being ar­
ranged by M,iss Glenn and Bill Hall.
wayEXPLANATION:
There are many explanations for this illusion. One 
method of performing this illusion requires the 
presence of izuo girls in the box. One girl curls up 
in the left half of the box with her head and hands 
protruding, giving the effect you see illustrated 
above. The other girl is doubled up in the right 
half of tKe'box, with only her feet showing. Nobody 
is sawed in half.-

celled. Carnegie Tech movies to

Cigarette advertising, too, has its tricks. 
Consider the illusion that “Flavor” can be 
achieved by some kind of magical hocus- 
pocus in manufacturing.
EXPLANATION: Just three factors control 
the flavor of a cigarette. The addition of arti­
ficial flavoring. The blending of various to­
baccos. And the quality of the tobaccos them­
selves. Quality is by far the most important. 
Domestic cigarette tobaccos vary in price 
from 5^' a pound up to 40^ a pound. Imported, 
tobaccos vary from 50? a pound to $1.15.
No wonder, then, that cigarettes, differ in. 
taste—since distinctive, pleasing flavor de­
pends so largely upon the blending of the cost- 
lier tobaccos.

April twenty-aocond has boon 
definitely sot for the Annual High 
School Play Day which W. A. A. 
sponsors annually for all Sonlor 
High Schools of t.ho city. Many of 
our own Freshmen who woro tho 
lucky representatives of their 
schools last year remember tho 
thrilling tlmo they had as guests of 
Carnegie, and from the replies that 
Leah Voogtly has been receiving 
we are pretty sure that the high 
schools are as enthusiastic as ever. 
We only hope that the sun decides 
to park on the cut for the whole 
day and not chase everyone iuside 
like ho did last year.
Mitzie Gray reports that there 
are about forty participants signed 
up for the swimming season. It’s 
a splendid opportunity to develop 
speed as well as skill and M,itzie 
is willing to help everyone who 
can at least make a couple of 
lengths. As usual there will be 
several preliminary matches in or­
der to practice clipping off the sec­
onds and the first of these will 
probably be held next week. Once 
again, don’t forget that practices 
are 3:30 on Tuesday, 12:30 Wed­
nesday and 12:30 on Thursday.
Volleyball promises to bo its 
usual popular soil’. Over fifty par­
ticipants have attended tho noon 
practices so far, and none of them 
have mlssod thoir lunch. That 
must bo tho reason why a group 
of Sophomores and Juniors aro 
•starting a busoball team with noon­
time meets.
In answer to tho numerous re­
quests about basketball points, If 
has been decided to award full 
credit to all members of tho first 
team and their substitutes—pro­
vided they have half practices. 
Those who were on the second 
team and had half practices will be 
awarded seventy-five points. All 
others who have half practices will 
receive fifty points.
Marion McNar.v wants to remind 
you all once again that you’ll miss 
a lot if you miss the Swimming 
Party on April first. W. A. A. 
guarantees to replace all broken 
noses, ankles and such minor in­
juries like a certain Sophomore 
sustained last time. So put a big 
circle around that date in your 
Plebe Bible and we'll be seeing 
you.,

Support Given 
“Buy Carnegie” 
Plan Gratifying
Now that heartening signs of a 
turn Cor the' better appear in our 
economic illness, let’s not forget 
that the “Buy Carnegie” plan 
is still operating and that 
its application will aid the 
rapid recovery of our class­
mates. Many of our fellow stu­
dents have undoubtedly benefited 
by the support of the plan in the 
past, and continued support is sure 
to get results.
It goes without saying that those 
students who benefited by the 
idea are deeply appreciative of the 
fine support given to the "Buy Car­
negie” idea by the student body. 
Cooperation in such matters will 
help us get much more from our 
nights on the campus than mero 
study would afford. Let us all pull 
together to get every Carnegie 
man back on his feet again.

All night students who are to 
graduate in June and who have 
not yet had their pictures taken 
for the Thistle should make ar­
rangements to do so not later 
than Friday, March 24.
Pictures may be taken by ap­
pointment at the White Studios, 
Fairfax Hotel, Fifth avenue and 
Craig street, during the day or 
evening. Those who wish to 
have the photographer come out 
on the campus, Friday, March 
24, should return their notifica­
tion card.
The Night Thistle Staff would 
appreciate it if every student 
would make an effort to have 
his picture taken next week in 
order to complete the copy for 
press.

Week in Full
Vas you there Charley? Shoor, 
didn’t you see me looking wise and 
taking all the sights in? That was 
some, party from start to finish. 
All you wanted to eat—no there 
were no seconds although some 
tried to obtain their second dose 
of cream. Oh, I forgot to mention.
I am talking about the last ban­
quet which the night engineers 
held at the Roosevelt Hotel. Why 
everybody and his brother was on 
the job, I hardly could find room 
to stand, and from the number of 
times they had to add tables, it al­
most became a swell—ing party.
Yes, they had everything from 
soup to fish and back again, al­
though some of the fish must 
have been captured when Noah 
roamed the high seas, but then 
who cares about that small item. 
The big thing was the number of 
playthings they gave us and there­
on hinges a tale too long to re­
late, that is if I should go into de— 
tail.
Neatly wrapped in a small piece 
of strange looking paper, more 
about the paper later, was a small 
tliing-a-ma-gig which must have 
come from the Orient, very appro­
priate at this time to say the least. 
It sort of reminded me of a tale I 
heard a long time ago, see no evil,
. hear no evil, speak no evil. In 
other words it was that tri-monkey 
combination of China. Just how 
it fitted into the party I cannot 
say, but it was there at all events.
i don' know whether the monkey 
business or the paper which sur­
rounded the monkey business was 
the object, that was the puzzle, 
and these days puzzles are big 
items in one’s daily life. Try as 1 
would, the only logic I could glean 
from the slip was that you were 
kept guessing all the time what 
the printing was about. It was al­
most like one of those clippings 
the explorers find when digging 
from relics. A rosetta stone may 
be necessary to throw some light 
upon the problem.
About the other toys, well we 
had — and — and ballons and 
whistles and crickets and lots of 
books and pencils and everything 
and then some more things. My 
pockets were bulging by the time 
I finished gathering up all they 
gave me. Surely got my money’s 
worth. The' souvenirs furnished 
by the different firms in the city 
certainly were appreciated and 
they should come in handy. The 
largeness of the whole party was 
something to talk about especially 
in thee days of not so plenty.
Here I am still talking about the 
banquet and I find that my space 
is getting limited. After we fin­
ished eating, a ’ few talks were 
given by our guests, and then the 
real fun started. I better not talk 
about that because those who were 
there know what it was, and those 
who weren't there, well all I can 
say is, that they should have been 
there. If you want more informa­
tion, see me at the next banquet 
and I’ll tell you
They are ‘shootin’ ” the pictures 
again for the Thistle. Suppose it 
is pleasant to watch the birdie 
come out and salute you as the 
camera man presses the bulb. I 
haven’t had my picture taken for 
a long time and sort’a forget the 
funny sensations which come over 
one when trying to ‘‘smile please 
—just that way — now quiet— 
there.” I’m not in that class this 
year so I won’t have the pleasure 
of cracking a plate, but for the 
others I hope all of them report so 
that I can look at them in the fin­
ished Thistle Guess I better sign 
oil or else get shot. . So. so long 
until—That was the Idle Night 
Student signing off until this time 
next week. The Tartan bids you 
all good night.
Last year the Plaid staged a con­
test to find the night student who 
traveled the most number of miles 
per week to school. The Plaid has 
decided to conduct another contest 
to find out who will wear the crown 
this year.
It is the wish of the stall that 
every night student who thinks he 
travels more than the average 
number of miles per week to 
school send in his name along with 
the information which will be re­
quested in next week’s issue of the 
Tartan.
The contest held last year was 
a great success in that it brought 
a deluge of letters to the office 
showing that the students were 
really interested in presenting 
their claims and at the same time 
some interesting information was 
obtained as to the sacrifices being 
made by students in order to 
further, their education.
Those who are interested and 
who travel the most miles should 
watch for next week’s Tartan when 
complete information will be given 
on the rules of the contest. The 
committee on the contest is an­
ticipating a large number of entries 
so keep them busy with your data.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT the Engineers' banquet 
more than lived up to its ad­
vance predictions and the size 
of the turnout for the affair 
made one think that the repres­
sion was an unknown thing to 
night students.
THAT the alleged banquet 
started with a bang . . . and 
continued at the same dizzy 
pace . . . balloons filled with 
water furnishing much fun, 
even though such tactics were 
uncalled for . . . noise makers 
and the hot orchestra ran an 
even race . . . much fish was 
in evidence that evening and 
some of it was questionable . . . 
everybody appreciated the cur­
tailed speeches . . . but why 
did some leave before the best 
part of the program came on? 
. . . Snowball covered himself 
with glory, but the rest held up 
their end in fine style . . .
those lap sitters furnished 
everything from merriment to 
“the most humiliating moment 
of my life” . . . wonder what 
some of those looking on 
thought of . . . especially those 
who felt slighted ... or re­
warded?
THAT an arts student whose 
head was formerly thinly 
thatched now boasts of as fine 
a head of hair as Alex-trition as 
a result of an endearing present 
from one of the attendant 
chorines.
THAT it's all over now, some 
were pleased, some not, but all 
in all it was about the most suc­
cessful banquet ever staged and 
three cheers for those responsi­
ble.
Beauty of Campus 
Awakens Student
The quadrangle can claim sev­
eral distinctions in local geographic, 
meterological and physical senses. 
To the average student at this 
time of the year, this rectangular 
patch of real estate is very annoy­
ing. The general agreement among 
the students is that the quadrangle 
is the wettest place in town on a 
rainy night, the roughest on a 
windy night, the coldest on a cold 
night, and the prettiest place when 
there is a moon worth speaking of.
The view from Machinery Hall, 
looking towards the Arts Building, 
is quite effective on a moonlight 
night. The light is reflected softly 
from the various buildings, giving 
them a silvery sheen. The win­
dow’s of unoccupied rooms appear 
like black banners hung on the 
walls. The walks, likewise sil­
vered, by the moonlight, remind 
one of what might possibly be 
canals of still water, and the peo­
ple on them seem to glide along as 
though totally detached from the 
whole scene.
Petty worries, studies, and mul­
titudinous other cares are forgotten 
for the moment as one gazes at 
the beautiful scene before him.

THE OAKLAND 
BANK”
The facilities of the Roosevelt 
Hotel- Banquet Hall were taxed to 
capacity on March 11 when the 
Night College of Engineering held 
its annual banquet. Perhaps no 
other banquet held in recent years 
by the group has had such whole­
hearted support.
The faculty guests at the ban­
quet were Dr. Roscoe M. Ihrig, 
Professor Robert B. Leighou, and 
Mr. Dalziel McKelway. Included 
among those present were former 
students who were glad of an op­
portunity of renewing old acquaint­
ances.
At each plate were numerous 
novelties and souvenirs supplied 
by the various business firms of 
the city for which thanks are in 
order. Following the dinner was 
the entertaining feature of the 
evening and it was much enjoyed.
When the time came to award a 
prize to the student selling the 
most tickets for the affair it was 
found that three students were 
tied for the honor and accordingly 
prizes w’ere given to each;

Progress Made 
In Education 
Shown By Report
In September, 1929 President 
Hoover organized a committee to 
study social trends of the United 
States. One of the uiauy trends 
studied was that of education. 
The committee has finished its 
work and the report has been pub­
lished in twro large volumes.
A general picture of education is 
given in the report. The commit­
tee finds a transformation begin­
ning about 1S75 from the frontier 
type school to - the modern unit 
school. Today schools have much 
finer equipment, the elementary 
and secondary schools are free and 
states have undertaken to provide 
normal schools. The functions of 
the schools have been extended to 
include care of health and personal 
training.
The schools vary considerably 
because the administration is local 
instead of national. The age be­
yond which children remain in 
schools is rising because they are 
being withdrawn from industry and 
allowed to stay in school longer.
Curricula Enlarged
There has been a constant addi­
tion to the curricula beginning in 
-S90 with seven main subjects un­
til in 1928 there were over forty- 
seven. Scientific and practical 
courses have been added to the 
curriculum and now represent the 
majority of subjects offered. An­
other significant movement has 
been the leveling dowrn of high 
school subects to the eighth grade. 
This has resulted in junior high 
schools which take over the last 
two years in the secondary schools 
and the first year in the high 
school.
Paralleling the junior high school 
is the junior college which com­
bines public 'school and the first 
years in college of the past. Those 
who desire to go further than the 
junior college may enter graduate 
and professional schools.
Colleges Broaden Field
Colleges are offering less mathe­
matics and classics and more pro­
fessional and practical subjects. 
Another change is the attitude to­
wards education abroad. In the 
past students desiring to pursue 
work of advanced nature were re­
quired to go to Europe, but today 
American schools are offering 
work similar to that of European 
universities and dependence upon 
foreign schools is minimized.
Still another feature in the edu­
cational system in our country is 
the night school. In almost every 
large city night courses are being 
given, and when these have not 
been available, extension courses: 
have become prominent.
Even those deprived of the prime 
essentials of obtaining an educa­
tion have been considered and they 
are now receiving educational 
training which was once thought 
out of the question. Take the deaf 
and the blind for instance and note 
the advances made. Nor has the 
feeble minded or the sub normal 
child been neglected.
Teaching Methods Advanced
The status of teachers has been 
advanced both financially and edu­
cationally. Newer and better 
methods of teaching have come 
about. The schools are no longer 
simply rooms but well planned 
buildings containing libraries, 
swimming pools, laboratories, and 
recitation rooms. The colleges no 
longer compel military training in 
the curricula. Religion is left to 
special groups organized for the 
purpose. Athletics have become 
an important educational issue 
which has not yet been solved.
As a whole a tremendous change 
has taken .place in the whole setup 
of our educational system and the 
past fifty years has shown a wonder­
ful period of progress and growth. 
Newer and different problems wil! 
present themselves from time to 
time, and new solutions will be 
found to cope with the situations 
as they arise.
the services ot ex­
perienced officers are 
available to our de­
positors
It will be a thrill you’ll want to repeat. So muko a 
“(Into” to call again next week. Charges, of courflo, 
can always be reversed.

The attendance at the free lec­
tures given in the Union in tho 
past has ahvays been creditable, 
and this year it is unusually good. 
The number of students, especially, 
attending these lectures is edifying 
and is certainly a mark of appre­
ciation on their part with respect 
to the lecturers.
The last series by Dr. Masing of 
Siemens and I-Ialske in Germany 
was very well attended and the 
discussions following each of tho 
three lectures wrere indicative of 
the interest taken. The attendance 
at these particular lectures was 
further augmented through the 
kindness of the professors in sev­
eral departments who dismissed 
their classes thus enabling the 
students to attend. This conces­
sion was taken advantage of and 
greatly appreciated by the stu­
dents in the respective classes.
Students are advised to watch

Sculptural Hall
Nobody pays attention to the 
thin, haggard old men who daily 
warm the marble benches in the 
Hall of Sculpture at the Carnegie 
.Museum. Most of these forlorn 
people are apparently unemploy­
ed and friendless.
Shunned by society everywhere, 
they are apparently aware of their 
.undesirableness, and seek peace 
and comfort among mute, inani­
mate statues of those illustrious 
men who symbolize the glory that 
was Greece’s and the power that | 
was Rome’s. Here alone do they 
find themselves tolerated where 
men do not turn away at their ap­
proach.
For hours they seem to sit as 
rigid and motionless as the statues 
themselves, perhaps marveling at 
the consummate skill and artistry 
of the ancient sculptor, admiring 
the muscular development of the 
Grecian wrestlers or the mascu­
line grace and beauty of the Ro­
man athlete.
Occasionally, with battered hats 
in hand, they venture timidly 
through the art galleries, but they 
only stare and pass onward, their 
expressionless features never a 
gauge of their emotions. If they 
ihave, through their .frequent com­
muning witli the statues, acquired 
a benignancy of soul, ‘for the ap­
preciation of the secrets and mys­
teries of art, no one will ever 
know.

The “Y” study room is - a busy 
place these evenings and one finds 
difficulty in securing a place to sit. 
The night students have taken 
complete possession of the room. 
The picture presented is a rather' 
interesting one.
At the long table in the center of 
the room are seated students busy 
at work with their eyes glued to 
a book and their pencils going at 
full speed. Occasionally a conver­
sation or discussion is started and 
this distracts those who are trying 
to study, but they do their work 
as best they can despite the un­
welcomed disturbance.
In another corner more students 
are talking about a particularly 
difficult problem while still others 
discuss subjects that are' equally 
absorbing, skating parties, stories 
and jokes, and then that ever pop-' 
ular group of listeners, all absorb­
ed in the general discussions. In­
dividual opinions on the relative 
value of each subject are express­
ed.
A never ending change, one topic 
following another, stress given to 
some important situation by the 
raising of voices or by gestures and 
at times a veritable bedlam seems 
to engulf the room. Yes, indeed, 
the “Y” room presents quite a pic- 
ture of night student life.

Immediate Action Needed!
No more welcome news has been received by the people of 
tlie country than that of the meeting of Premiers MacDonald 
and Mussolini to consider the formation of a four-power Euro' 
pean disarmament program to insure peace. Although several 
previous attempts 100 the part of the leading powers of Europe 
have been ludicrous failures, somes faith should be placed in 
the new efforts to effect disarmament. This meeting also places 
some hope for agreement at the World Economic Disarmament 
Conference to be held next summer, because the failure of the. 
' past conferences have been caused by the unwillingness of the 
powerful countries to disarm to .the extent demanded by pro­
posed plans.
Premier MacDonald is quoted as saying that peace must be 
organized quickly, if it is to be preserved at all. Why is he 
in such a hurry? lie, as well as other knowing people, realizes 
that a breaking point will soon be reached in international af­
fairs if: something is not done immediately to relieve the strain. 
Jugoslavia, Rumania, Czecho-Slovakia, known as the Little En­
tente, recently signed a single treaty which provides for unlim­
ited military, political, and economic co-operation. Russia is 
not on any too good terms with England as a result of the 
"Buy British” policy adopted by the Empire at the Ottawa 
Conference last fall. France and Germany have yet to be con­
sulted about the newest plan, but it is not likely that Prance 
will not be willing to co-operate because of her fear of an­
other German invasion. One authority says that France was 
instrumental in forming the Little Entente to prevent agressive 
action by Germany. The memory of war is still fresh in the 
minds of many Germans, and although conditions have been 
somewhat unstable during the past few months, it is not un­
likely that Hitler will refuse to co-operate to prevent war and 
insure peace if Germany’s armament problems are to be placed 
on the same level with those of the other powers The United 
States should also welcome participation in such an agreement, 
which would strengthen treaties made in the past for co-opera­
tion, provided the ultimate end would insure peace.
No one wants war. The League of Nations has failed mis­
erably in handling the Japanese affair and if immediate action 
is to be taken and if the World Economic Disarmament Con­
ference is to be a success, the leading powers must agree to dis­
arm and forget individual interests of superiority. Americans 
will welcome more good news—if it still remains good news!
Wouldn’t it be interesting to learn more.about these dis­
armament problems, as well as about other problems affecting 
international welfare? It has been proposed by the Y. M. C. A. 
to sponsor a model economic disarmament conference 100 the 
.campus next month, provided enough students are interested in 
attending the sessions. Members of the Department of Eco­
nomics have agreed to co-operate in planning the program, and 
jt is proposed that impartial talks be given, to be followed by 
• open discussion. As yet, not many students have manifested 
interest in the proposed meetings, and unless more interest is 
•shown, the conference will not be undertaken. Those interested 
are asked to leave their names at the “Y” office.
When Things Look Darkest!
When life seems to have played you a mean deal and you 
feel yourself slipping into the depths of despair, stop for a mo­
ment and think of the Universe. Let your mind rove at will on 
the thought of the many things that seem beyond the range of 
human understanding. How many worlds are there besides the 
one on which we are living? Where is the end of space? Who 
created this mystery that we can only begin to comprehend? 
These are some of the questions that are likely to be asked in 
reviewing the mystery of mysteries. Go further yet, keep your 
train of thought in this direction until you begin to realize the 
vastness of all that lies beyoiid this world, for then and then 
only, can a comparison between you and your worldly surround­
ings be made in its proper light. Doesn’t such a contrast make 
your problems look insignificant? Perhaps, then, you will 
laugh at your boldness in considering your trouble to be so im­
portant that it should cause you to be discouraged with life.
Many College Graduates Are Listed 
Among Inmates at Sing Sing Prison
If the percentage of the alumni 
of a college that finds its way into 
Sing Sing were the criterion for 
rating schools, Carnegie’s non-rep­
resentation wouldn't place it in 
high stead.
“All the best known colleges are 
represented in Sing Sing Prison, 
but the majority of crimes for 
which college men are jailed are 
different from those of non-college 
men," declares Anthony N. Peter­
son, chaplain of the prison, in an 
article in The Redboolc for Febru­
ary. "College educed prisoners 
commit larceny three times as fre­
quently as others; forgery Is their 
most popular crime; and fow of 
tho prisoners have worked their 
way through college.
"Alumni of the best-known col­
leges and universities (including 
any own) share prison tasks with 
mon whoBe mentality is that of a 
little child, underprivileged boys 
who have never been taught to' 
read and write, and foreigners who 
cannot speak Intelligible English.
“On a single day last week, en­
tirely without prearrangement, I 
liad occasion to talk with former 
students of Princeton, Cornell, Sy­
racuse, Pennsylvania, and Okla­
homa Universities. Among other 
colleges and universities that I re­
call having had representatives in 
Sing Sing are Harvard, Williams, 
Hamilton, Bowdoin, Niagara, Dick­
inson, Fiske, Carlisle, Vanderbilt, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Tennessee, 
Oregon, Iowa, Southern California, 
Brooklyn Tech, Columbia, Ford- 
ham, New York, Cambridge, Glas­
gow, Berlin, Paris, Seven Oaks 
College (England) and St. Joseph’s 
College (Holland), besides gym­
nasia and pedagogia in various Eu­
ropean countries. When a college 
glee club or choir sings here, there 
is almost certain to be an alumni 
reunion with at least one man who 
wears the prison gray.
College men seem to feel the 
disgrace of their conviction and 
imprisonment more intensely than 
any other group of inmates. Usu­
ally, too, they think back of the 
punishment to the crime for which 
it was inflicted. Nevertheless, 
their superior Intelligence prompts 
them to accept quietly their new 
situations, and as a rule college 
men are model prisoners, disci­
plinary measures among them be­
ing practically unknown.
"For economy of prison admiuis- 
istration, amoug other reasons, 
college men are not often put to 
such menial tasks as sweeping up 
refuse, but are assigned work for 
which their previous training es­
pecially fits them,” says Chaplain 
Petersen.
“To the best of my knowledge, 
we have not had any school teach­
ers or .college professors among 
our prisoners. Whether this is be­
cause such men acquire a real edu­
cation at college. 01* because of 
something connected with the es­
sential altruism of their profession, 
the truth remains that those who 
make teaching their life-work do 
not come to Sing Sing.”
Physicists Find 
Photronic Cell 
Has Practical Use
Russell E. Sternier ’33 and Ed­
ward L. McCandless ’33. Depart­
ment of Physics, have just com­
pleted an investigation of the 
photronic cell, particularly with 
reference to its response to color­
ed light.
The photronic cell is a disc of 
metal provided with a light sen­
sitive surface. The metal disc is 
connected to one terminal of a 
microammeter, and the light sensi­
tive coating is connected to the 
other terminal.- When the surface 
of the disc is exposed to light a 
current is generated in the meter, 
which is directly proportional to 
the intensity of the illumination of 
the disc. The meter scale is 
divided in foot candles of illumi­
nation. ,
Sternier and McCandless have 
shown that it is possible to use the 
photronic cell for measuring the 
intensity of railway and traffic 
signal lights by applying a suitable 
correcting factors to the- meter 
reading.

THE SURROUNDING 
WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
When the affairs of one’s own 
co\jntry are in a state of unrest it 
is only natural that track is lost 
of those in other nations even 
though they might" affect condi­
tions at home. Things are hap­
pening in other countries which 
are just as serious as our own hap­
penings. All trading in the dollar 
exchange 'has been resumed in 
both Paris and London.
Greece has been thrown under 
martial law and is now ruled , by 
dictator. This was caused by 
the fact that the Republican party 
lost in a general election which 
gave the anxious General Plasteras 
the chance for which he had been 
waiting. He claimed that, the 
only, reason for the drastic action 
was the fact that he ¦ wanted to 
annihiliate Communism and secure 
public order. The last dictator to 
rule Greece ended up in a prison. 
Just what will happen to the new­
est dictator in the world will be 
interesting to observe.
Belgium bankers claim that their 
country has reached the bottom of 
depression. Gold has been flowing 
into the banks. This is a sure sign 
that the people have regained their 
confidence and are taking their 
savings out of their socks and 
putting them into the banks.
An interesting point was brought 
out during an international bank­
ers meeting in this same country. 
It was discovered that the Belgian 
banks had a larger gold reserve 
than they had reported. Upon fur­
ther examination it was discovered 
that this reserve was supposed to 
be secret. In other words when 
the bankers were telling the peo­
ple of Belgium not to hoard their 
gold they piled up nice little re­
serves.. There is no need for peo­
ple here to worry about any such 
situation, since our banks are not 
allowed to hoard gold secretly.
While most of the people of the 
world are worrying about financial 
status of their native countries 
some of the statesmen have other 
ideas. International treaties and 
agreements are being made be­
tween groups of nations. Two com­
bines in particular are interesting. 
Some writers have hinted at the 
possibility of a war. By next week 
the nations entering into the agree­
ments and the terms should be 
made more or less public.
THE MELLON PAZOOZIE—
The Mellon Hall "Pazoozie” happened last 
Wednesday night. Knowing that everyone would 
be interested in just what a “Pazoozie” happened 
to be we delved deeper.
It all took the form of a radio program with 
the boarders from the stable supplying the tal­
ent. Of course, “Mo” Osborn was the master of 
ceremonies and played the role of announcer.
The program 
opened with a 
p res idential 
address close­
ly followed by 
a Guy Lom- 
b a r d o act 
featuring Jane 
Francy as 
Gracie Allen, 
and what a job
she did. Everybody was in the proper frame of 
mind for the thrilling melodrama that was to 
come.
As all melodramas must, this one had a hero­
ine, Betty Beep; a hero, Willy Jones, and a vil- 
lian, Jerry Sly. All these characters were taken 
by our old favorite Audrey “Boots” KeHey of 
"It’s‘a beautiful day to be glad in” fame. Char­
acter changes were done by sliding in and out of 
different hats with the corresponding facial ex­
pressions. Some idea of what a thriller the play 
was can be had from the following quotation 
of the closing lines. Willy embraces Betty and 
says, “I don’t care If your father was a spy.” 
Betty: “My father a spy?” Willy: “Yes, in the 
mint.” Betty: “Heavens! My father a mint spy.” 
Quick curtain.*****
ODDS AND ENDS—
When you step into Thistle Hall Friday you’ll 
hardly know the place. The moonlight will shine 
in through the windows all night long. A money 
back guarantee goes with that statement, so ’tis 
rumored. See for yourself.
If you’ve wondered what happened to the Arts 
Ball decorations here’s the answer: • The Beta 
Sigma Rho pledges carted them all up to their 
house and snuck them in without the actives 
seeing them and finally brought them forth as 
decorations at their pledge dance. The boys 
won’t brag about the size of their new house, but 
they say they ran short of material before the 
first floor was well under way.
The “Duchess of Deadpan” was sure in full 
glory when Saint Patrick’s Day rolled around and 
they served cake with “green” icing in the grill. 
The whole school paid more or less liomeage .to 
Patty with green shirts and ties making their 
only appearance of the year and several orange 
blouses also being flaunted.
It seems Mellon Hall also boasts of a giraffe 
and many readers have confused it with the 
one mentioned last week. This beast has Asi- 
bides for a name, but as yet has found no such 
purpose to fill similar to that of his Forbes Hall 
brethren.
Bill Sliann and Mo Osborn were the first couple 
to open Schenley Park for “the season.” It hap­
pened a week ago Sunday.
Which brings to mind that today is the first 
day of spring. Steer clear of the Fence.
Three Alpha Kaps skating in front of Maggie 
Murpli, Betty Farrell with only one skate.
Five Art School lassies wading in the Panther 
Hollow pond—a sure cure for a cold if you take 
their word for it.

NOTES OF A FENCER’S SECRETARY—
Dear Mr. F. F.:
We’ve just returned from the .T. P. and we’re 
sorry to hear that you were engaged for the even-
injg (though not like the time at tho lake), and 
so unable to attend. But you are one of ihe se­
lect few who know us as a pair of ex-gossipers, 
and you can imagine- how we longed to get back 
into the harness with so much deliciously “dirty” 
work going the way of common mud.
The gorgeously bedecked Mortar Boards were, 
to say the least, “savior faire”—having a dinner 
before the Prom. Really, it is quite swanky to 
jump from the soup and fish straight into the. 
thick of the receiving line.
And now, to start the ball of gossip rolling 
straight down that long line of grand marchers! 
First there was Betty Farrell with a self-con­
scious T. Xer, Mary Husband with a “tallie” 
(sorry about the name), Qinny and her Hudson 
Bay seal, Sue with a French Norman, and Lo­
retta whose Cannon guarantees no bangs for the 
evening. Not least, but just because she’s last 
there was Jean Ritzel finishing up the line of 
committee members with a Mr. X. Y. Z.
As for the rest of the famous personages (?) 
How about Billy’s new suit of tails worn in 
honor of the fair Alicia, or the real honest to 
goodness society report from the Press who had 
the crust to grab a pencil and paper in the mid­
dle of the march and start scribbling frantically, 
or the campus bachelor, Jesse T. himself, who 
perched near the Mortar Board punch bowl dur­
ing the latter part of the evening, crunching 
stacks of cookies?
(A penciled note says: “Now insert white
slip,” but we find we’ve lost It. Aren’t vou glad? 
F. F.)
Then we saw Betty Farrell with a different man 
every intermission. (J. V. L. wasn’t doing so bad 
himself.) . . . Alpha Kap’s Intersorority chairman 
and newsgatherer, Edinundson and Brad Edle- 
blut . . . Max Piekarski and Student Council

liams, hotfooting it with Coal Miner Rankin . . .

haired Tip Varner and Betty Ailes . . . Alice 
Henzi and Puppet Editor Bill Lazarus . . . 
Prexy Baker leaving early .... . Kay Kaiser play­
ing “Star Dust” variations at least three times 
... Oh me, oh my.
And then for the last dance of the evening— 
with twilight and arc lights furnishing a silvery 
brilliance for 
the dancer s 
w h o waltzed 
to the silvery 
strains of 
Kay’s German 
Band. Uuumin, 
it was a grand 
p r o m a n d 
we’re only too 
sorry that you
were called to Washington for such an import­
ant conference with his Excellency. Better luck / 
next year.
Your goil Friday and her Boy Friend.* * * * *i
WELL, NOW—
Mr. John Q. Man will get the proverbial break 
once again if the Mortar Boards have their way. 
This austere group of young ladies has decided 
to do something different arid hold a dance in 
Thistle Hall soon for which tickets will be sold 
only to co;eds. Not a bad idea, we must say.* * * ¦* o
Lo and behold, the Alpha Kap organization of
united sistern is again at peace after a week-end
of much initiating and matrice toting. From 
what we can learn, the sisters about wore them­
selves out making the pledges comfortable—and 
we understand the event was to be an initiation. 
The Beta Pi’s are next!

EDGEWORTH SMOKING TOBACCO
English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
In general critics give first place 
and enduring recognition to those 
literary artists whose expression 
is exact—to those whose language 
“fits their ideas like a glove.” 
Many an otherwise capable por­
trayer or thinker has been relegat­
ed to obsurity because of failure to 
use words in their most accurate 
and accepted sense. This accuracy 
and acceptation are beyond an 
ordinary recognition of differences. 
For example, all but the illiterate 
distinguish between “healthy”— 
meaning “having health,” and 
“healthful” — meaning “giving 
health:” or, between “famous”— 
meaning "celebrated” or “noted,” 
and "notorious” — meaning "un­
favorably known” or "of ill-repute.” 
There are many such words com­
monly but illigically confused.
On the other hand there are 
many others in Avliich the distinc­
tion is not readily made. For ex­
ample, often the clear line of de­
marcation is not drawn between 
“evident” and “obvious.” The two 
are synonyms, but there is a shade 
of meaning expressed in one that 
is not in the other. The first, "evi­
dent” means “clear with proof;” 
the second, “obvious,” means “clear 
without proof.” One of the axioms, 
such as "a part is less than the 
whole,” is obvious. The passing 
of winter is evident from certain 
phenomena of nautre.
The importance of making dis­
tinctions in word-meanings may be 
brought home by an incident from 
the life of Daniel Webster. The 
only point that may be questioned 
.about it is the authenticity. Ac­
cording to some biographers tho 
great orator was wanting in con­
jugal felicity. It is told that on an 
occasion his wife came upon him 
while he was embracing one of the 
ladies in waiting. “I am surprised," 
said Mrs. Webster. Her husband, 
known for his extraordinary abili­
ties in an emergency, extracted 
himself by the well known par- 
limentary procedure of shifting the 
burden to the opposition. He 
said, ‘‘My dear, when will you ever 
learn to use good English? I am 
“surprised;” you are “astonished.” 
His namesake, Noah, .supports him 
in his contention, for of “surprise” 
he says that it means "to strike- 
with wonder, especially at some­
thing unexpected;” whereas of 
“astonish” his explanation is that 
it is stronger and "implies the 
shock of sudden surprise, especial­
ly at something unaccountable.”
It is apparent that labor spent 
in the acquisition of accuracy of 
expression has its compensations.
Marshall Bidwell Gives 
Second Lenten Lecture
Mr. Marshall Bidwell, organist

the second in a series of Lenten 
lectures Saturday evening at S:15, 
in the Carnegie Music Hall. The 
topic of the lecture will be “Ro­

Mr. Bidwell is presenting these 
lectures, one each Saturday evening 
until the week before Easter, in 
place of his usual Saturday eve­
ning organ recital.
The topics of the remaining lec­
tures will be: ‘‘The Melodic Genius 
of Bach,” April 1, and “The Lyric 
Style of Brahms.” April 8.

1. Baths can be taken only by 
special permission, and at times 
indicated by the instructors.
2. Sleeping quarters are not to

the day.
3. The strictest order is to be 
observed in the embroidery room.

The University of Kentucky

has been the custom before.
Someone pulled a fast one on 
the .Harvard Crimson editorial 
staff. A false issue of the paper 
was published containing a story 
naming a new president of the col­
lege. The local newspapers hur­
ried to catch up with what they 
thought was a “scoop” only to dis­
cover that the editors knew 
nothing of the issue.
Baylor University gathered up 
the ten most popular slang expres­
sions and sent them to Funk and 
Wagnalls who are making a survey 
of the slang used in American col­
leges and universities. Among tho 
ten submitted were: “Nertz,”
“O’Kay,” “Scram,” “You’re Telling 
Me,” ‘‘Hot-cha,” and ‘‘Don’t Be 
Silly.”
From what seems to be going 
around here it looks to me that 
“Dot’sa Fine, Boss” should be add­
ed.
After’having received plenty of 
poor marks from the professor in

Time and again, Bell System engineers have 
demonstrated their pioneering bent in working out 
unusual telephone construction problems.
For example, they laid a huge conduit under the 
Harlem River. They dredged a trench in the river 
bottom, lowered enormous sections of iron pipe, 
sent down divers to join the sections, encased the 
finished tube in concrete. Through this they ran 
telephone cables forming one of New York’s main 
lines oj> communication. Across the Gila River in 
Arizona they constructed a catenary span 2373 feet 
long. To bridge oceans, they developed radio tele­
phony. They have built telephone lines over moun­
tains, across deserts, through swamps.
Their resourcefulness in getting through, over or 
under natural barriers makes possible telephone ser­
vice that is practically world wide in reach.
