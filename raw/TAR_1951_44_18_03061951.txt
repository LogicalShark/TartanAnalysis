Debate Team 
Wins Over 
Muhlenberg
Pugh, Readio Decision 
Barnstorming Visitors; 
Penn State Also Here
The Carnegie affirmative debate 
teams of Pugh and Readio defeat­
ed a barn-storming Muhlenberg 
negative team in a cross-examina­
tion style debate last Thursday 
evening in the Carnegie Union. 
The debate, held before a small 
audience of students and faculty 
in the Council room, was judged 
in favor of the affirmative team 
by a 3 to 2 decision of the judges.
Muhlenberg suffered one of 
their few defeats of the tour at 
the hands of the Tech debaters. 
During the last week, Muhlenberg 
has debated teams at the Univer­
sity of Chicago, Northwestern, 
Penn State, Allegheny and several 
other schools en route.
Another Carnegie affirmative 
team of Claster and Curhan met a 
barn-storming Penn State team 
in the Union on Tuesday evening. 
No decision was rendered in this 
debate.
Flower Show 
Opens Sunday
Phipps Conservatory 
Schedules Exhibition
The Spring Flower Show, one 
of the community’s most popular 
events, opens at Phipps Conserva­
tory on Palm Sunday, March 18, 
and continues through Sunday, 
April 8.
More than 20,000 individual 
spring flowers and plants in newly 
designed settings and display 
rooms are included in this annual 
exhibition. For example there is a 
Maple Sugar Festival depicting the 
famous “sugaring off” process, an 
artistic view of a snow-capped 
capped mountain in the setting of 
an Oriental garden, and a spring 
garden in full bloom.
The Conservatory is open every 
day from 9 to 5 p.m. and special 
illuminated shows are presented 
evenings during the Spring Show 
from 7 to 10 p.m.

Pershing Rifles Gives The Nod 
To Twentv-One New CandidatesJ
Blotky Makes Call At Recent Military Ball;
Scholastic, Military Achievement Important
One of the highlights of the Military Ball last Saturday night 
was the call to Pershing Rifles, a ROTC honorary. This underclass 
honorary is a part of the national organization which includes nearly 
60 chapters. The purpose of Pershing Rifles is to provide extra 
drill for members and because off —
this the units are sometimes call­
ed on to act as color guards for 
parades.
The chapter of this honorary 
was started at Carnegie Tech over 
a year ago. They now have their 
own rifle team which came out 
tenth in the country out of sev­
enty companies. Members of 
Pershing Rifles are distinguished 
by the blue and white braid on the 
left shoulder of the uniforms. It 
is Carnegie’s only drill team.
Pledges are called for military 
as well as scholastic record and 
interest. Most of these men are 
expected to go into advanced 
ROTC. A1 Blotky, captain of 
Pershing Rifles, called the follow­
ing men to the honorary: Fredric 
Appl, John Armour, Edward 
Braun, Thomas Ferris, John Gam­
ble, John Hale, David Hoffspiegel,

Gives Invitation 
ToT ournament
Students interested in debate 
are cordially invited to a tourna­
ment sponsored by the Carnegie 
Tech Debate club in MMCC this 
evening at 7:30 p.m.
The topic for debate will be the 
national question: Resolved; the 
non-communist nations should 
form a new international organ­
ization. This tournament is one of 
a series of round-robm debates in 
which city colleges and those near 
Pittsburgh participate.
The schedule of debates and 
rooms will be posted in 103 MMCC 
this evening. This will enable the 
audience to choose the schools they 
wish to hear.
school’s fraternities and between 
sororities, will take place Friday 
night. This event will be follow­
ed on Saturday night with a clos­
ed dance for these organizations— 
Greek Swing.
Three Songs 
Greek Sing will begin at 7:30 
p.m. Friday night, March 9. Each 
of the sororities and fraternities 
participating will sing three songs. 
One is to be about the group, an­
other to be chosen from a list of 
forty selections compiled by the 
committee, and a third to be chos­
en without any specifications. No 
accompaniment will be used oth­
er than that necessary for pitch.
The awards will be presented on 
the basis of the group’s intonation, 
blend, diction, projection, tone 
control, etc. The accuracy and 
dynamics as well as the variation 
in styles of the chosen musical 
numbers will also be considered, 
impartial judges have been chosen 
from sources outside the school.
Co-Chairmen 
Peggy Duff and Ralph Snyder, 
representing respectively the Pan­
hellenic Council and the Council 
of Fraternity Presidents, are co- 
chairmen for the sing session. 
Recordings of the songs will be 
made and distributed after the 
competition to the participating 
groups.
Announcement of the winning 
groups will be made during inter­
mission at Greek Swing, the fol­
lowing evening, March 10. Bill 
Le Roy’s orchestra will provide the 
music for this informal dance from 
9 to 1 at the ballroom in the Syria 
Mosque. The committee has an­
nounced that the entrance door 
will be in the new wing of the 
Mosque. This entrance is to the 
right of the main lobby on

In those years when the student needs religion the most, 
he is led by his education to discard and neglect it. There are 
no credit units given for hours spent in church or reading the 
Bible. The temptation to ignore God is doubly strong at the 
present time when every day we read and hear continually of 
the violation of the cardinal principéis of religion by almost 
every country in the world. We deny God because this evidence 
seems to point to His non-existance.
An occasional talk with God, an inner examination of 
one’s self, can often be most revealing, for it gives a person«, 
the opportunity to see himself and his problems in a new ¡ 
light as he relates them to God. The confidence gained from ! 
religious convictions is a great aid to a doubtful mind when 
a decision must be made.
It seems unreasonable to give up God at the very time 
when He can be our greatest aid and guide. And as for prov­
ing His existance: find the equation for the bursting life of 
Spring and you will have your proof.

The recent report to Student Council which showed the 
Scot and Thistle to be in the red points up again the lack 
of student support of student activities. If these publications 
would be forced to cease operations, it would be the fault 
of the students themselves and not administrative pressure.
The position of the Scot, in particular, is a delicate one. Last 
year and the early part of this year the magazine tried to give the 
students the type of literary and variety publication which, it 
was thought, the majority of students favored. This attempt was 
a financial failure—and the staff realized that it could not hope 
to continue publication if these deficits were to grow through 
lack of student support.
Three alternatives presented themselves: (1) cut print­
ing costs, (2) increase the price of the magazine, or (3) change 
the type of magazine presented to the students. Since the 
first two courses seemed impossible at that time, the Scot 
adjusted its content to try to increase sales. The result of 
the change is the current uproar, justifiable to a great extent, 
over the jokes and cartoons appearing in the magazine. But 
sales have increased, although they have not increased to 
the point where the magazine is self supporting.
Now it seems possible that the Scot may reduce costs by 
having the printing done at cheaper rates. Whether the appear­
ance and readibility of the magazine will suffer is a question 
yet to be answered, but the fact remains that continued publi­
cation of the magazine will depend upon student support and 
not upon measures which are at best only poor substitutes for 
an interested, appreciative student body.
Students clamored for the Scot when it was discontinued 
last year, blaming everyone but themselves. Now it’s up 
to the students again—either buy the magazine or it will 
be discontinued, this time for good.
Think It Over
By Richard A. Ahlstrom
The anecdote told here is true but because even the most in­
conspicuous item in a paper might be read and cause harm to those 
yet living let us pretend that it is a story told by a minstral of
old. ?-----------------------------------------------------set up also. But peace could not
last forever and so after many
years all the nations of the world
found themselves in yet another
war.
This time the forces of the God­
less master from the East descend­
ed upon the little country of 
Lionia. The invading soldiers had 
very little discipline, and the 
young daughter of the doctor of 
the small village of Chiar was 
often forced to hide in the woods 
for weeks at a time in order to 
avoid them, even though she was 
but a very young girl.
Learned Songs 
After a time greater discipline 
was enforced among the soldiers 
of the East, and it became reason­
ably safe for the young girl to re­
main at home even when the sol­
diers were in the town. The sol­
diers often came to her father’s 
office, and this provided an oppor­
tunity for the young girl to prac­
tice the language of the people to 
the East. She even learned their 
songs, many of which were very 
beautiful.
The people were never at east 
with the soldiers though, for they 
were very child-like; friendly 
one day and insanely angry the 
next. But the war went on to the 
west and things were quiet in 
Lionia.
[Continued on page 3]
Once upon a time, a long, long 
time ago, there was a war. It 
seemed that all the nations of the 
world were envolved in this war. 
It was a dreadful thing to behold, 
this war, for it was reckoned that 
more than 64 million men wore 
the uniform of their country be­
fore it ended and that more than 
30 million casualties were counted.
Food Shortage 
It was during this war that the 
people of the largest of the war­
ring nations found that there was 
not enough food to eat, especially 
in the cities and so one day the 
people paraded through the streets 
of the city shouting for bread. 
Revolutionists heard the cry and 
said, “Look the people are re­
volting.”
And so it came to pass that a 
new regime was set up and after 
a time the war ended, and for all 
the people of the world a peace 
ensued.
Peace. It was wonderful to be 
at peace again after the many 
years of fighting. But, as after 
all preceding wars, there were 
more people who died of hunger 
during the peace then had died in 
battle. These people died without 
the glory and so the living “never 
knew”.
And so the years passed and in 
other countries new regimes were
By Dolly Mitchell
WHA’ HE SAY . . . Professor 
Wayne Edmister, chemical engi­
neering, presented a talk to a 
graduate seminar on Friday enti­
tled: “Application of Functionals 
to Distillation of Continuum Mix­
tures of Indefinite Number of 
Components such as Petroleum.” 
The talk must have been very in­
teresting. *
SPRING FERVOR . . . Last week 
produced definite signs that spring 
is near. Male students cleaned 
their white bucks and Schenley 
Park is doing a booming business. 
ANOTHER S.O.S. . . . Public Re­
lations Office is desperately in 
need of hanging. For months now 
this office has had to leave beauti­
ful pictures sitting on the floor 
because no wire can be gotten to 
hang them. The defense work is 
affecting Carnegie in many ways. 
GIRLS . . . “All the Pittsburgh 
newspaper photographers claim 
that Tech has the prettiest girls in 
town.” This is a direct quote from 
Stan March, public relations, who 
should know whereof he speaks. 
INTRODUCTION . . . Speaking of 
direct quotes, this columnist was 
introduced to Professor Johnson 
as the writer of the Kitchen Sink. 
The first words he said were: “Oh, 
still alive?”
SECOND CHILDHOOD . . . Idaho 
State College conducted a survey 
which showed that almost half 
the coeds there sleep with teddy 
bears, pandas, or other stuffed toy 
animals.
COVER -UP . . . Guess what, they 
are finally filling up the holes on 
campus.
PAY DAY ... If anyone is inter­
ested in being manager of Greek . 
Sing this year, you will receive ten 
dollars for services. At last stu­
dents are being reimbursed for 
some campus sweat-of-the-brow 
projects.
BIG BABY . . . Another job is 
open for any Carnegie student in­
terested in part-time work. The 
Dean of Men’s office is looking for 
a student to baby sit with a four­
teen-year old boy. Why doesn’t he 
join the Boy Scouts?
PUBLICITY . . . Pitt Parade fea- # 
tured pictures on spring on the 
Carnegie Tech campus last Fri­
day evening.
TILT ... If the senior class is 
thinking about giving a memorial 
to Carnegie, here is a suggestion. 
Buy mail boxes for the offices in 
Industries Hall. At present there 
are numerous dilapidated card­
board boxes hung on walls beside 
offices over there—like the home­
made box by Room 13IB. ***
The theme of this year’s religious discussion week, “A i 
Faith for These Times,” is an obvious one in the light of 
the present world situation. Too many of us have become 
so calloused by the hatred of man for man that we have I 
discarded religion entirely and have turned to the easy phil­
osophy of fatalism.

eagerness can be over-done! He’s alluding, of course, to all
these quick-trick cigarette tests—the ones that ask you to decide on cigarette

chips are down, he realizes cigarette mildness can’t ^

Songs, Dances Of Little Child 
Soften Hearts Of Soldiers
[Continued from page 2]
Then news came that the armies of the East were retreating. 
This was bad news to the people because it meant that the con­
trol which was exercised over the soldiers would be gone in the 
haste of the retreat, but it was good news also, for it meant that 
the people of Lionia might beO
liberated.
Horrible Sight
Again for many days at a time 
the young girl found herself hid­
ing in the woods. Then one day 
she returned to the village and 
looking into the window of her 
home to see if it were safe to 
enter, she saw a group of soldiers 
mistreating her father.
Forgetting her own danger, she 
rushed inside. The soldiers were 
very angry and seemed capable of 
any action. She could understand 
what they were saying and you 
may well imagine her terror when 
she heard one of them say in a 
loud, uncontrolled voice, “Let’s 
kill him!”
One of the soldiers pulled his 
revolver from his holster and 
pointed it at the young girl’s fa­
ther.
What To Do?
She was petrified with fear. 
Then her eye fell upon her accor- 
dian. She picked it up and began 
playing the melodies that these 
soldiers loved best. The songs 
from home.
And so it came to pass that the 
soldiers forgot that they were go­
ing to shoot the young girl’s fa­
ther and began to dance and sing 
instead, for they were like chil­
dren.
This is religious emphasis week. 
What greater problem confronts 
us today than the problem of Rus­
sia? The world today is like the 
man with a gun to his head. The 
young girl could have flung her-

self at the soldiers, to what avail? 
But she didn’t, instead she began 
to play her accordian and the mu­
sic touched the hearts of the sol­
diers.
In this week as we turn to em­
phasize religion, isn’t it appropri­
ate that we remember that if mere 
music could turn the minds of the 
Russian soldiers from their evil 
deed, how very effective a prayer 
to God might be in the world 
situation of today.

However, despite a home-floor 
advantage, which is considerably 
large in the New Wilmington 
“bandbox”, the “Towering Titans” 
had to go all-out to stop coach 
Mel Cratsley’s scrappy cagers.
No Easy Win
Even though Westminster held 
the lead throughout the game, the 
advantage was never great enough 
that the Titans could afford to 
coast. In fact, the visiting Tar­
tans outscored the heavily fav­
ored home team from the begin­
ning of the second stanza until 
the final whistle.
Bill Farbacher, Skibo pivot 
man, came through with one of 
his best performances, leading the j 
game’s scorers with 19 points and j 
doing a great job of rebounding j 
against his much taller opponents.
For the victorious Titans it was 
Johnny Abraham who led the 
point-getting. The speedy Irwin 
product connected for seven field­
ers and four fouls for a total of t 
18, and played an excellent floor 
game.
Early Lead
Westminster jumped off to an 
opening-minute lead on Abra­
ham’s fielder and foul, and were 
never headed thereafter. Leading' 
by 18-12 at the end of the period, j 
it began to look as though the 
Titans would win going away.
However, the Plaid floormen : 
rolled 21 points through the hoop J 
in the second quarter and nar- j 
rowed the home team’s advantage 
to 38-33 at intermission. Despite 
a fourth period rally, however, j 
the Tartans could do no better; 
than hold the Titans even in the 
•ccond half.

Rifle Team Defeats California 
State Teachers And Wash-Jeff
The Carnegie Tech varsity rifle team scored their first two vic­
tories of the current campaign last week as they downed the teams 
of California State Teachers College and Washington and Jefferson
College. *
In the victory over California 
Teachers the Skibos posted a total 
of 1367 points to the loser’s 1319 
score. It was Bob Power who 
lead the scoring for the Tartans as 
he shot a total of 277 out of a 
possible 300 points. By scoring a 
275 total, Don Lundquist copped 
second place for the Skibos. John 
Unangst posted a 272 to take third 
place, while Kolbe and team cap­
tain John Montstream each scored 
totals of 269 to round out the Tar­
tan scoring.
Last Thursday the Tartans trav­
eled to Washington, Pa., where 
they met and defeated the team 
of Washington and Jefferson by a 
team score of 1368 to 1334 for the 
home team. Once again it was 
Bob Power who lead the Skibos 
to their victory, although at the 
time of this writing the official in­
dividual scores had not been re­
ceived by the CIT coach, Sergeant 
Westerman.
Of the three matches that they 
have lost, one of the roughest was 
the loss to West Virginia Univer­
sity in which the Skibos lost by 
only 39 points. It is significant to 
point out that the Mountaineers 
are reputed to have one of the 
finest college rifle teams in the 
country this year.

Pictured above is the start of the 220-yard dash which was won

picture.
yard free style. Westminster took 
second and third place with Wal­
lace and Wilson crossing the fin­
ish line in that order.
Another first was garnered when 
Grey Duncan won the hotly con­
tested fancy dive from Coefield 
of Slippery Rock. Duncan’s team­
mate, Anderson, took fourth place 
in the same event. Evanhoff of 
Edinboro was third and Edmonson 
of Slippery Rock was fifth.
Time Error 
Nick Demas took the other first 
place when he finished the 100 
yard free style in 2:30 flat. He 
was followed closely by Wallace 
of the Titans and Cross of Edin­
boro. Tom Astle of the Plaid also 
placed by taking sixth place. The 
fourth and fifth slots were filled 
by Hirsch of Case and McGrath of 
Westminster respectively.
Demas was fourth in the 50 yard 
dash; Cross of Edinboro was the 
victor. After much discussion by 
the officials, it was decided that 
Dalrymple of W&J and McGrath 
of Westminster ended in a dead 
heat for second. Error by the 
timer caused the meet director to 
eliminate clocking for this event.
Another Second 
A1 Macy of the Plaid followed 
close behind Hearn of Allegheny
to take second in the 440 yard free 
style event. Gavett of Westmin­
ster, Johnson of Edinboro, Karlin 
of W&J, and Thomas of Case fol­
lowed in that order.
In the 200 yard backstroke, CIT 
managed to squeeze out a third 
and fifth place, Wedell and Mac­
Donald doing the honors. Zuber- 
buhler of Allegheny had the best 
time at 2:31.9. He was trailed by 
Federhoff of Edinboro, Weddell of 
CIT, Racketta of Slippery Rock,'
MacDonald of CIT, and Braun of 
the Titans.
The only event in which the 
Tartans failed to gather any 
points, was the 200 yard breast­
stroke. Slippery Rock’s Letsche 
set the pace, covering the distance 
in 2:46.9 minutes. Williams of 
Edinboro and Cassell of Westmin­
ster took the next two spots.
Award Medals
The first three men, or teams, of 
each event were awarded medals 
for their efforts. Carnegie took 
six of these medals. It was the 
first time in the seven-year his­
tory of the meet that Carnegie 
Tech carried off first place honors.
Westminster entered the meet 
with the best season’s record, hav­
ing won 8 while losing only 3. 
W&J boasted the second best rec­
ord with 5 victories and only 2 
defeats. Allegheny’s 7 wins and 
3 losses was good enough for third, 
while CIT’s 6 victories and 4 de­
feats gave them the fourth best 
season’s record prior to the Re­
lays. Edinboro was also above the 
.500 mark for the season, with a 
7-5 record. Slippery Rock and 
Case did not do as well having 
2-6 and 2-9 records respectively.

In the final game of the 1950-51 
basketball season, the Skibo floor- 
men went down to their twelfth 
defeat of the year, bowing to 
Westminster by a 71-66 margin.
Second place Edinboro was only 
one point behind, while the West­
minster Titans were a point and a 
half off the pace. In the closely 
fought meet, Allegheny took fourth 
with 35 points, Washington-Jeffer­
son copped fifth with 21%, Slip­
pery Rock sixth with eight, and 
Cleveland’s Case was last with six.
Record Broken
The competition was so fierce 
that the meet was decided in the 
final event. Prior to it, CIT held 
the lead with 46 points, but was 
followed by Edinboro with 41 and 
Westminster with 36%. The last 
event was the 400 yard free style 
relay.
The relay was run in two heats, 
with the second and third place 
teams in the first heat, and the 
Tartans in the second. Westmin­
ster took the first heat with a rec­
ord breaking time of 3:52.3. Edin­
boro was also under the previous 
record in taking second. W&J took 
third in the heat. This meant that 
the Plaid would have to take at 
least fourth to cop the meet.
Swimming against a record 
breaking time, CIT’s Kramer, 
Astle, McDonald, and Demas 
fought to make the necessary time. 
With neither of the other two 
teams in their heat fast enough to 
set a good pace, the Tartans were 
forced to pace themselves. They 
made just good enough time for 
the necessary fourth and the meet 
title.

The American league leadership 
remained tied in a three way knot 
as the Citcom Omicrons, Theta Xi 
“A”, and the Little Sekuds each 
added another victory to their 
skeins to post identical 7-1 records.
Easy Win 
The Little Sekuds did it the easy 
way by virtue of a forfeit Friday 
night from the Greatest five. Theta 
XI “A” was never troubled by Pi 
Kappa Alpha as it won a slow 
disinteresting game, 26-14.
Citcom was the only team to 
have trouble as it downed a deter­
mined ATO squad 27-25. In a see­
saw game the Citcom cagers 
grabbed the final lead with only 
three minutes to go and then froze 
the ball until the final gun.
In other American league games 
Phi Kappa “A” copped a 41-29 
victory from Kappa Sigma “B” to 
move into a fourth place tie with 
their opponents. Beta Sigma Rho 
marked up its first two on the

As Beck Paces 
Tartan Scoring
Carnegie Tech’s Tartan cagers 
copped their final home game of 
the season and gained revenge for 
an earlier season setback by de­
feating the Grove City College 
floor team last Thursday evening 
in Skibo gymnasium. The final 
score was 70-58.
Coach Mel Cratsley gave, the 
four senior members of the squad 
an opportunity to make their final 
home appearance a memorable 
one by inserting all four in the 
starting lineup.
Beck Stars
Although the seniors gave a 
highly creditable performance, it 
was a junior, guard Tom Beck, 
who paced the Plaid hoopstfers to 
their ninth win of the campaign. 
The little Central Catholic product 
meshed seven fielders and four 
fouls for a total of 18 points.
Oddly enough, in an age where 
basketball is a “big man’s” game, 
it remained for the smallest player 
on the floor, 5’8” Danny Hill, to 
take scoring honors for the night. 
Hill’s 19 points, along with his 
spectacular floor play, kept the 
Grovers in contention.
Robertson In Check
Mike Robertson, 6’4” Wolverine 
center, whose 25 points sank the 
Plaid in the earlier battle at Grove 
City, was kept well in check by 
the Skibo defense, and had to be 
satisfied with eight markers.
Ranking second in the Tartan 
scoring parade was senior for­
ward Bob McCullough, who tallied 
10 points and played his usual 
steady floor game.
The visiting Grovers held the 
Tartan seniors to a 16-14 first 
quarter advantage but, with Kay 
Thompson, Tom Craig, and Bill 
Farbacher in the lineup, the Scots 
increased their margin to -35-26 
at intermission.
Take Big Lead
Scoring during the second half 
was comparatively even, although 
the Plaid cagers led by as much 
as 18 points during the third per­
iod.

INQUIRING REPORTER
Student Opinions Vary 
On Council Question
Student Council is in front of the firing squad this week. As a 
coordinating committee of student affairs, Council has been plodding 
along on two feet for years now. Is Council really worth all the 
bother. “What do you think of Student Council?” the inquiring re­
porter asked. ?
Peggy McCaai, junior: My idea represent the student body and to
of Student
Council is very 
hazy since I 
have never 
been at a meet­
ing. However, 
student coun­
cils don’t seem 
t o accomplish 
much in most 
schools; they 
are nothing 
more than figureheads, and 
wouldn't go against the adminis­
tration. I feel that council is just
a figurehead here. But as I said
my idea of council isn’t concrete.” 
Marius Edema, senior: “This
Council is an 
i m p r ovement 
over what it 
was in about 
1946. tremen­
dously so. It 
has still a long 
wat to go, but 
council is work­
ing on it. I 
think a student 
council should 
be representative of the campus, 
handle all the problems which
other organizations do not han­
dle, and be a coordinating com­
mittee. It should not be a voice 
of the administration. Our coun­
cil does try to accomplish these 
purposes and it is getting away 
from the administration.”

! handle campus problems. If stu- 
j dents object to the way council is 
being run, they should let repre­

complaining about it, for council 
is trying to do a good job.”
Marian Fischman, junior: "Our 
student council 
seems to be 
well organized.
What they do is 
always made 
known to the 
I students. Some­
times I feel that 
the Tartan does 
more for coun­
cil than coun­
cil does for the 
school, in the way of publicity 
that is. I feel council does ac­
complish quite a bit throughout 
the school year.”
Joe Manchester, freshman: “I
think student council should be 
rep resentative 
of the students, 
which it is. I 
also think it 
should be more

it. That is the

Editorial-
Be A Recruiter
After our blast in last week’s edition of the “Plaid”, con­
cerning the low enrollment in the general study courses at 
Carnegie Tech Evening School, we felt that an enlargement 
of the argument would be in order.
Firstly it would appear to be that the fault lies in lack of 
proper publicity, and public relations work done by the school, 
but upon investigation it becomes very evident that this is not 
the case, for well in advance of registration time, the Evening 
School Administration sends literature, posters and registration 
blanks to employers in the Pittsburgh district inviting their em­
ployees to enroll at Carnegie Tech Evening School. These posters, 
and accompanying literature, list courses ranging from graduate 
to Humanistic and Social Studies.
Any prospective student is invited to send for a copy 
of the Grey Book which gives a complete listing of the Even­
ing School Curricula. Former students who attended the last 
semester of school are also sent circulars announcing regis­
tration particulars. Thus we feel that the fault does not lie 
in the lack of adequate advertisement by Evening School. 
Our bold assumption is that the fault is with the evening 
student himself. He should possess enough school pride to 
act as ambassador, and also salesman for Evening School. He 
should convince his friends, neighbors, and fellow workers 
that they can obtain a fine education at Carnegie Tech Even­
ing School, whether it be in the Technical or in General Study 
Courses. If there are not enough students to warrant a par­
ticular course, he should, with the aid of other evening stu­
dents, strive to obtain the required number necessary for 
scheduling a course at Carnegie Tech Evening School.
Plaid Needs 
More Workers
Send News, Personals 
Throuh Plaid Mail
We are in dire straits, a news­
paper with a dearth of news and 
possibly a lack of readers. This is 
not fair to our budding reporters 
and journalists, so if you are capa­
ble of producing a tidbit like the 
following, do so!
“What so-called Hydraulic En­
gineer was seen carousing about 
the staid halls of the William Penn 
during the Engineers’ Banquet?'”
Now we know that you, dear 
reader, are in possession of many 
more interesting and informative 
facts than the above, but we never 
hear of them. If you have knowl­
edge of any items that will be of 
interest, contact our editors, or re­
porters, or drop a note in the 
school mail box. Address “The 
Plaid”: that is sufficient to reach 
us.
Marriages, engagements, birth, 
those who are about to be called 
to service, house purchasers, new 
or new used car owners, unusual 
occupations or commuting dis­
tances; the list could go on and on. 
Please come to our aid, we cannot 
put out a paper that is readable 
without your help.

Since a previous issue o£ the 
Plaid, our reporter has obtained 
more information regarding Will 
i Schnarrenberger, Evening Student
1 Council Member.!Will, present treasurer and past 
vice-president of Council, is a 
i metallographer and staff photog- 
| rapher for Hall Laboratories, Inc., 
where he is employed.
Another interesting fact is that 
Will was appointed advisor by his 
] company for the Junior Achieve- 
| ment National Organization. This 
organization is for boys and girls 
i under 21 years of age that set up a 
i small corporation of their own. 
| They carry on the business, such 
as selling stocks, manufacturing 
I and producing an article just as 
| large corporations do.
Will’s group manufactured per- 
t fumed bath salts which won a na- 
| tional award. Of all the other 
¡Junior Achievement National Or- 
I ganizations in the United States,
' theirs ranked third prize.
