PITT DEFEATS TECH, 2 TO 1
VOL. TV
Partati
PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 19, 1910Number 16
Game Does Not Count in the Intercollegiate Standing
Tech was scheduled to meet State last Saturday 
night in a hockey game at the Gardens but, owing 
to the fact the faculty at State refused to allow her 
team compete, Pitt was substituted. As it was not 
a regularly scheduled contest between the two teams 
it does not count in the figuring up of the standing 
of the league, which may be fortunate for Tech as 
Pitt won by a score of 2 to 1. It is to be hoped 
that State remains in the league and that no other 
team is added which will make the league other 
than inter-collegiate. The State Collegian says in 
an editorial, “State is not making a rash move in tak­
ing up hockey. As a college game it has made rapid 
strides in the last few years.” It is said that after 
the mid-year’s the sport will be renewed. Let us 
sincerely hope so.
To return to the game of last Saturday evening. 
It was some what rough, and was fast or slow ac­
cording to the mood of the players. All the points 
were scored in the first half, Pitt getting the first and 
third and Tech the second. Hittner received another 
cut over the eye. There was an excessive number 
of penalties “handed out” during the game. The 
teams lined up as follows, using the names of Tar­
tans and All-Collegians instead of Tech and Pitt:

On Friday night, the 7th inst, the majority of stu­
dents in the First Year Night Class remained after 
the lecture in Chemistry and formed a Class Society.
Kelley called the meeting to order and McCarthy 
recorded the minutes. On a motion being made, it 
was decided to elect only the officers necessary to 
carry on business at that time. Several nominations 
were made for the different offices, an election was 
then held by scratch ballot, and the following offi­
cers elected:
Kelley, President.
Mohler, Vice President.
'Bell, Secretary.
Thomas, Treasurer.
It was decided that any other officers needed 
would be elected at the next meeting.
The object of this Society, as similar societies, 
is to infuse into the members what is known as

Class^Spirit, to bring the members into closer touch 
with each other, and to promote good fellowship; 
also to bring before the members all matters which 
may be of interest to them and to encourage them 
to persevere in their endeavors to obtain the end 
for which they are now struggling.
It is the intention of the Class to hold a Smoker 
in the near future, and also arrange for other enter­
tainment, where the students can get together and 
become acquainted.
The Society will elect a representative to look 
after the Athletic interests of its members; also a 
representative on the Tartan, who will keep the 
members posted on everything of interest.

The members of the Woodlawn Cottage Club, of 
Woodalwn avenue, held the first reception and gen­
eral blow-out of the season last Wednesday night. 
The house, always an attractive retreat, was gaily 
decorated for the occasion. In the large and cheery 
living room a wood fire crackeled merrily on the 
hearth, and shed its warm rays throughout the en­
tire lower floor. This room, with its window seats 
and mission furniture, was hung with garlands of 
southern smilax entwined about the chains support­
ing the stained glass Venetian lanterns, which are 
rare objects of great beauty. The tapestried walls 
with the high mahogany wainscoating, made an ef­
fective background for the beautiful gowns worn by 
the girls, the guests of the evening.
Mr. Day, of the faculty of the School for Appren­
tices and Journeymen, and his wife, the chaperones, 
stood in a bower of tropical foilage in the adjoining 
hallway. From somewhere in the rear came the 
sounds of an orchestra that wafted themselves on 
the air as softly as the summer zephyrs. After en­
joying themselves in an informal manner, the com­
pany seated itself about the long tables of the Club, 
which were tastily decorated with candles shaded 
with open work brass. American beauties were to 
be seen in profusion, and the chief tone of the decor­
ation of the room was a warm green. Each man 
presented his lady with a jeweled remembrance of 
the evening, and the howlingly swell affair was 
brought to a close.

At the last regular meeting of the Mho Club Mr 
Wynn, of the Westinghouse Electric Company, gave 
a talk on “Electric Railway Project Work.” He 
gave an outline of the methods employed in the lay­
ing out of an electric railway, especially interurban, 
and without 'going into detail on any particular 
branch of the work, gave his hearers a general idea 
of the problems an engineer has to solve in the (Ic­
ing of such work.
During the discussion which followed this talk 
the question of telephoning from moving cars was 
brought up. This question was held over to the 
next meeting for further discussion, at which tune 
it is desired that at least one member will be pre­
pared to read a paper or give a talk, either on this 
subject or on some other subject of interest to the 
club.
The principal business of the evening was the 
changing of the club colors from maroon and gray 
to blue and gold, and the appointing of a room com­
mittee whose duty is to see that the new club room 
is properly taken care of and kept in good condition.
The committee was appionted at the meeting:
J. R. McClain,
J. A. Clark,
R. R. Stewart,
W. B. Underwood.
Stewart having left school another will be ap­
pointed in his place.
At the next regular meeting, on the second Wed­
nesday of February, the officers for the second sem­
ester will be elected. All members should be pres­
ent.

Owing to the midyear exams, coming in the week 
of January 24th, the White Friar trials will not be 
held until the following week, beginning on January 
31st. It is hoped that by taking this action the 
Club will have more men out and that it will not in­
terfere with the standing of the men. As this delay 
cuts a week off rehearsal time, it is hoped that all 
those who intend to come out will turn their appli­
cation blanks in promptly, in order that no time 
may be lost in that direction. By the week of the 
trials the management will be able to announce def- 
intely the ,play, etc.

Last Friday morning, when the walks in the vicin­
ity of the buildings were so thickly covered over 
with a layer of slush as to make walking a very slow 
process, Mr. Pfouts took the bull by the horns. Be­
coming more furious with each step, by the time he 
reached the buildings his clothes smoked. Then he 
wanted to know why, and received no more satis­
faction than the statement that “it was the other 
fellow’s job to clean off the walks in the park.” Mr. 
Pfouts is pre-eminently a man of action and not red- 
tape. Knowing how useless would be any further in­
quiry, he met the section of the Industrials that re­
ported to his Pattern Shop and asked for volunteers. 
There was not a man who hesitated in making a 
reply in the affirmative, and in less than half an hour 
the entire mess of partly frozen snow and ice was 
well removed from the sidewalks before the A. & J. 
buildings. After it was all over, all hands went to 
the Commons and had a spread provided by Mr. 
Pfouts.
The men who did the job were:
H. C. Larrabee 
J. Nunge 
M. T. Ahlers 
H. B. Atkins

The report of the judgment of the last designs in 
Class B Plan and Orders submitted to the Society of 
Beaux Arts Architects in New York, has been receiv­
ed today. The report shows that an extraordinarily 
large number of students entered in these competi­
tions. In the Order Class alone 106 mentions were 
awarded, and the number of competitors was be­
tween 150 and 175. In the Class B Plan 85 mentions 
were awarded and something over 125 competitors 
submitted designs.
Mr. Ferrand, of our Department of Architecture, 
was present at the judgment as representative of 
our School. He reports that the designs submitted 
were in general of unusual degree of merit. In the 
Class B Plan competition our atelier was one of the
two whose students were awarded two first men­
tions, the other being that of Mr. Prevot, of New 
York. In the Order Class none of our students suc­
ceeded in securing a mention with especial honor, 
although a large number of them received mentions.
A list of the students in our Department who re­
ceived mentions in the two classes respectively, is

Mr. James F. Moore, a builder, of Pittsburg, has 
offered to the students of the Department of Archi­
tecture $25 in prizes for the best designs submitted 
for a dormitory building to accommodate 20 stud­
ents, to be situated on Woodlawn avenue. The pro­
gram for the competition has been prepared and will 
be given out in its final form on January 17. The 
designs are to be rendered on January 31. They will 
be judged and awards of the competition announced 
February 2. This competition ought to be of espec­
ial interest to our students, and is more nearly like 
those conducted in ordinary practice than are the 
student competitions which are the basis of their 
study of design in the School.

It seems that every so often, we are forced to 
make remarks concerning the lack of interest that 
is taken in connection with some of the student ac­
tivities. The particular thing to draw fire just now 
is the dearth of material from classes for publica­
tion in “The Tartan.” In times gone past, nearly all 
of the classes had active men on the job of collect­
ing material of interest and amusement, so that it 
might be used for the benefit of the whole Class. In 
one way this sort of thing has the tendency to draw 
together every part of the Schools. The Night 
Classes thus receive the notice of the day students 
and the other way round. We might even go so far 
as to say that “The Tartan” is one of the best, if not 
the only means of having the day and night classes 
on any sort of a common footing. No other activity 
made use of by the students can do the same on 
such a large scale.
In view of this, w'e are forced to wonder, often, 
why the members of the various classes permit their 
elected representative to lapse into inactivity, and 
thus cause the Class to sink into oblivion with not 
even passing notice. “The Tartan” has always pub­
lished all of the available material received, and is 
more than anxious to keep on doing so. Very often 
things have been received that have to be revised in
FyeD.my uCyVoVyV.F umD .LVsVaVLVyb.
Nearly every one in the Schools has heard rumors 
that there was to be no Glee and Mandolin Concert 
at Carnegie Music Hall. The way it was, there 
came very near being no concert, and thereby hangs 
our wail.
The Committee on Student Activities, in order to 
keep the men involved in good standing, find it 
necessary to frequently report on every man’s stand­
ing to determine his eligibility. This is perfectly 
good and proper; men come here primarily to learn, 
and not to engage in theatricals and concerts. All 
this is so plain it is self evident, and we have not 
the slightest comment to make on the fact that the 
men engaged in student activities should keep up 
their standing.
In cases like the Glee Club last week, there is 
something else to be considered. The organization 
has ben having rehearsals and preliminary concerts 
ever since early in the fall, and some time ago made 
arrangements to have their annual Pittsburg ap­
pearance in the Carnegie Music Hall. They had 
tickets printed, advertising arranged, programs in 
the process of being prepared, when the notice came, 
just a week before the date of their appearanec, that 
nearly half of the men in the clubs were deficient in 
their studies, and would not be permitted to appear. 
Any one with any knowledge of the running of musi­
cal clubs or dramatic clubs knows what a crippling 
effect such action would have. If it had not been 
for the fact that the Director told them to go ahead 
and have the concert on the date it was planned, no 
little money would have been lost by the postpone­
ment.
In view of the danger (from this source) connected 
with making arrangements and signing contracts for 
the appearance of any of the clubs, we would think 
it well for all of the men liable to be affected, to ap­
point representatives to suggest revision or amend­
ment to .the Student Activities Committee’s rules 
for their own protection. Such amendment might 
be in such a form as to make it impossible to de­
clare a man ineligible later than a month before 
the day of the principal concert or performance.

The January meeting of the Civil Society, held 
Saturday evening, was, as usual, very successful.
The technical discussion of the evening was led 
by Mr. Reed. He described in detail the construc­
tion of a cut stone arch bridge of which he had 
charge 011 the Boston and Albany Railroad. His ex­
periences with contractors and foremen were very 
instructive. Many plans were shown to illustrate 
the problem of replacing a bridge without interrupt­
ing traffic.
Mr. L. F. Baker, an enthusiastic member of the 
Society, and a Spanish war veteran, gave a vivid ac­
count of the Battle of Santiago.
His talk was illustrated by many slides. Baker 
served on several ships during the war, but at the 
time of the battle was on board the Oregon—and 
so did not get into the main fight. He was after­
wards engaged in several skirmishes around Havana, 
and has a medal for heroic service under fire.
After the speeches the lunch committee became 
the center of attraction, until President Johnson, act­
ing as toastmaster, began to ask for stories. Nearly 
everyone responded, and day men, night men and 
Alumni laughed together till the lights began to fail.

On Wednesday morning Miss Nickerson took six 
girls from the Household Arts department for a les­
son in marketing. The first place visited was 
Medick’s butcher shop, which proved very interest­
ing and instructive. Mr. Medick cut up a side of 
beef and explained in a very clear manner the loca­
tion of the different cuts and their values and uses. 
Veal, lamb and pork were also cut, and explained 
in the same way. During a talk on the manufacture 
of sausage, one of the girls said that she never knew 
sausage was made; she thought it was taken from 
the pig just as it was sold. (The girl’s name has 
kindly been omitted here, because she is a Senior, 
and supposed to be versed on all primary things.)
The next place on the list was the market-house, 
visited in order to find out what vegetables, fruits 
and greens were to be had at this time of year. Be­
sides the regular winter varieties, there were some 
early spring fruits, such as strawberries and toma­
toes. On the counters several kinds of fish were dis­
played, and the girls became acquainted with many 
kinds they had not known before.
The morning was very pleasantly spent in this 
way; for a lesson so novel and instructive could not 
fail to please.
Mrs. Hamerschlag entertained the Senior class at 
a reception in her home on Forbes tsreet on Friday 
afternoon of last week. Excepting the Senior class, 
the Director and his two little sons were the only 
ones present, and it is said that the trio added much 
to the delightful afternoon which the Seniors enjoyed 
with their charming hostess.

R. R. Rose, in perspective class, speaking to Mr. 
Campbell about the vanishing point:
Rose—“Mr. Campbell, I don't know why you put 
your eye on the ground.”
Campbell—“Neither do I, if you do so.”
Will we have athletics? Well, yes, if we all are as 
enthusiastic about it as the School of A. D. From

Mr. Bergey ought to be suppressed. Here is "his

large rocks. When the hay and rocks balanced, he 
guessed the weight of the rocks, and so obtained the

You sing a little song or two;
You have a little chat;
You make a little candy fudge,
And then you take your hat:
You hold her hand and say “Good-bye”
As sweetly as you can—
Ain’t that a h------- of an evening
For a great big healthy man?
But the quick-witted co-ed replies:
You play for his reedy tenor;
You spill fudge on your second best frock; 
You smother your yawns behind your hand. .
And try not to look at the clock.
You listen to baseball dope and slang 
’Till your head is a perfect whirl—
Ain’t that a h------- of an evening
For a nice intelligent girl?
—Echange.
