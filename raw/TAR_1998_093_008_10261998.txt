By LISETTE MILLER-DIXON
Tartan Darkroom Manager
Since last winter, the School of Com­
puter Science (SCS) has been making 
preparations to find a replacement for 
Dean Raj Reddy. A search committee 
was formed earlier this year, and last 
Monday it formally announced, to the 
campus community, its intentions and 
wishes to find a qualified person.
There are 15 members, primarily from 
SCS and CIT, on the dean search com­
mittee. The search committee is using a 
review of SCS that was conducted last 
year by a separate committee. The re­
view outlines the status of SCS and 
progress it has made in recent years.

Raj Reddy will return to teaching and 
research after stepping down as dean.
Last January Dean Reddy an­
nounced his plans to resign and return 
to teaching and research beginning 
fall 1999. Reddy became dean at re­
quest of President Mehrabian and Pro­
vost Chrisiano in 1992 after former 
Dean Nico Habermann resigned. 
Reddy reluctantly agreed to serve a 
term of five years.
“Raj took over as acting dean and 
didn’t want the job, but it was obvious 
that he was doing an exceptional job, 
so Paul Christiano talked him into 
staying on,” said Charles Thorpe, prin­
cipal research scientist at the Robotics 
Institute.
Since Reddy has been dean of SCS, 
the undergraduate program was added 
to the school. Among other accom­
plishments, the school has made ma­
jor advances in human-computer in­
teraction (HCI) and computer network­
ing.
Prior to becoming dean, Reddy 
founded the Robotics Institute in 1979. 
In addition to Reddy’s advances for 
the University, he was awarded the 
Legion of Honor by President 
Mitterand of France in 1984, and he 
has received the IBM Research Ralph 
Gomory Fellow Award from IBM in 
1991 and the Association of Comput­
ing Machinery (AMC) Turing Award 
in 1995. The AMC Turing Award is 
the most prestigious award given to 
people making contributions to the 
computing community.
Initial actions to find a dean were 
taken last spring when Christiano 
asked Thorpe to chair a study looking 
into the school’s strengths and weak­
nesses. Thorpe said that the object of 
the committee was to “assess our

New drug threat hits campus
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan News Editor
Over the course of the past month, 
awareness of drugs like roofies has 
grown on campus. Fliers have been 
posted to alert students to the serious 
nature of such drugs. Despite these 
efforts, students shared stories and 
jokes about the drugs, demonstrating a 
relaxed attitude toward the situation.
Campus officials suspect that over 
the past month the use of drugs like 
roofies has been occurring at some 
parties at CMU. While there were 
reported incidents last year, the use 
of roofies and other drugs that cause 
memory loss is escalating on campus. 
Roofies is the street name for the drug 
Rohypnol. It belongs to a group of 
drugs that are illegal in the United 
States but are considered “date rape
drugs” because of their effects on 
memory and consciousness.
“I have spoken with a number of stu­
dent leaders, and I believe that students 
are generally aware of these drugs,” said 
Michael Murphy, dean of Student Af­
fairs. “However, we live in a climate of 
trust, and I do not think it would have 
crossed most student’s minds to be fear­
ful of this within our community. It is 
imperative that students understand 
that we are not immune and that they 
must be guarded and protect themselves 
and their friends.”
Victims have reported loss of memory, 
decreased alertness and physical coor­
dination, and dream-like states. Health 
Services and Campus Police have not 
been able to perform blood or urine tests 
in time, but Campus Police and Health 
Services believe that there are a few 
drugs which are likely to be involved.
The incidents reported thus far do not 
indicate that there is a pattern to where 
these drugs are being used. No group of 
students or parties stand alone as the 
users or distributors of these drugs.
“The parties where these incidents 
took place have varied in location and 
sponsorship,” said Barkin.
“It is important for students not to 
single out any group or circumstances as 
presenting the greatest risk,” said 
Murphy. “The fact is students are at risk 
whenever they allow someone they do 
not totally trust have access to a bever­
age or food they are consuming. It seems 
unlikely that there is a single source-, 
and the evidence is that the use has not 
been isolated to a single location.”
The University has taken a strong 
stance on the use of these drugs. Stu­
dents involved will face tough disciplin-

By BETSY SCOTT
Tartan Juriior Staffwriter
Last Saturday in McConomy Audi­
torium, Herbert A. Simon, professor of 
computer science and psychology, got 
the chance to deliver what he feels 
would be his final message to CMU as 
part of the Last Lecture Series. The 
Last Lecture series is a chance given to 
faculty members to deliver what they 
consider to be their most important 
message to campus.
The topic of Simon’s lecture was “Why 
teach at a research university?” His an­
swer was essentially that research is 
conducive to undergraduate learning.
Simon began his speech by addressing 
the bad press that research universities 
have been given by the media, which has 
accused them of ignoring their under­
graduates. Simon sought to explain the
relationship between research and teach­
ing, to point out that the two are not 
mutually exclusive.
Research, Simon explained, is simply 
question answering, driven by curiosity. 
The idea of curiosity as an essential part 
of the research process was a central 
theme to the lecture. Questions such as 
“How does a cell in the embryo of a fruit 
fly know whether to become a wing cell 
or a leg cell?” arouse one’s curiosity and 
begin a search for answers.
“Research is just persistent curiosity,” 
Simon said. “After a while you develop 
skills that make you good at it.” Accord­
ing to Simon, by bringing research into 
undergraduates lives, they will acquire 
that skill. By bringing research to an 
undergraduate level, students will learn 
to do something with their curiosity.
According to Simon, actively involv-

Career Center works through problems
By LISETTE MILLER-DIXON
Tartan Darkroom Manager 
& ENA KHAN
Tartan Managing Editor
After a series of major difficulties ear­
lier this semester, the Career Center is 
now in the process of getting itself back 
on track. Resignations from the director 
and two associate directors of the Career 
Center, along with the transition to 
TartanTRAK, a new job search system, 
has led to inefficient Career Center ser­
vice and complaints from students and 
recruiters. As a result of the problems, 
Paul Fowler, associate dean of Student 
Affairs, has assumed the role as the 
director of the Career Center and will 
act in that capacity for the remainder of 
the year.
The former director of the Career Cen­
ter, Ann Shields, left over the summer to
pursue a position as the director of the 
Career Center at Davidson College. In 
addition, Karen Litzinger and Eileen 
Buecher, two former associate directors 
of the Career Center, also left this past 
summer to pursue positions with other 
Universities.
“All of them left for advancement in 
their personal careers. They all had 
great opportunities,” said Fowler. This 
left several vacancies in the top posts 
and forced Fowler to assume responsi­
bility for the Career Center during its 
transition to a new campus recruit­
ment system.
After noticing inadequacies with their 
previous software, Resume Expert, the 
Career Center agreed to implement 
TartanTRAK, a subset of JobTRAK, to 
facilitate campus recruitment. Last year, 
nine universities participated in the first 
test run of JobTRAK for campus recruit­
ment. This year, CMU is one of 23 uni­
versities, including Johns Hopkins, 
Stanford, Duke, and Princeton, partici- 
patinginthe second testrun of JobTRAK. 
The program is a test, however, and is 
facing several software problems left 
unresolved.
“The online resume is unattractive. 
The companies look at them with Cou­
rier font. It is very bad,” said Mark 
Stover, a senior industrial management 
major and TartanTRAK user. Stover 
also complained about the overall effi­
ciency of the system. “It takes a good 10 
to 15 minutes to load the page and once 
it loads, you are still scrolling through 
all the old jobs,” said Stover.
“They [the Career Center] just started 
it with us this year and did not give us 
time to adapt to it quickly enough,” said 
Shan Ablack, a senior industrial man-

Student seeks diverse curriculum
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
With the end of International 
Festival ’98, a student is raising 
questions about the extent, to 
which CMU incorporates inter­
national diversity in its curricu­
lum. Kush Tyagi, a junior in elec­
trical and computer engineering, 
will be conducting a survey this 
week to gauge student interest in 
being able to choose from a 
broader range of cultural courses.
Tyagi is one of the presidents of 
Mayur, a Senate-recognized club 
on campus that focuses on South 
Asian culture and holds large 
events every semester. He felt 
that in order for the University to 
begin incorporating internation­
ally diverse programs, there 
would need to be something solid
to show that students were inter­
ested in taking such courses.
“It’s a starting point so that we 
know which direction to go in 
respect to international diver­
sity,” said Tyagi.
The survey will be conducted 
throughout the week using two 
different methods. There will be 
a table outside of Doherty Hall 
set up to survey people, and Tyagi 
is giving surveys to all RAs to 
pass it to students on their floors.
Trying to get student support 
for new courses is not a new oc­
currence. In 1989, a junior art 
major named Lisa Hoshina also 
conducted a survey. Hoshina was 
interested in starting a new 
Asian-American studies program 
within the History Department. 
She took a sample survey of 134 
students in Skibo. Of all the stu­
dents, 16 percent of whom were 
Asian, 49 percent felt that they 
would b.e interested in taking 
such a course. As a result there 
are currently Japanese and 
Chinese courses in the History 
and Modern Language Depart­
ments.
Peter Stearns, deanofH&SS, 
said that other attempts have 
been made in the past to start 
new language courses in He­
brew and Korean, but have 
failed. Steams also said that 
the H&SS curriculum is not as 
developed as he would like. “The 
University has been technically 
focused for a long time, and the 
kinds of courses in Humanities 
and Social Sciences concerning 
diversity haven’t been fully 
developed,” said Steams. “How-

Senate considers bylaws change
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan News Editor
Last Wednesday at Student 
Senate’s meeting two proposals 
for changing Student Senate by­
laws were presented for consid­
eration. Both changes were pre­
sented by senior biology major 
and chair of the Public Relations 
Committee, Jamie Chang. The 
first amendment would separate 
the fiscal policy from the bylaws 
and make it its own document.
“The purpose is to simplify the 
bylaws and make the Policy some­
thing that is more useful for orga­
nizations to use,” said Chang. 
“The Student Senate fiscal policy 
only applies to specific allocations 
made by Student Senate and is 
unwieldy as policy for organiza­
tions to use when it is the middle 
four pages of another document. 
Separating it makes it a concise 
document which is practical for 
Senate’s Funding and Recogni­
tion Committee and organiza­
tions to use.”
Other are concerned that the 
changes are unnecessary and may 
make the bylaws more confusing.
“I’m not against making the 
fiscal policy a separate document, 
but I do have concerns,” said elec­
trical and computer engineering 
(ECE) major and CIT Senator 
Mathew Monroe. “For one thing 
the don’t reference [the fiscal 
policy] in the proposed change.” 
‘The fiscal policy [change] was 
brought up last semester, and it 
got voted down,” said senior ECE 
major and CIT Senator Lawrence
McCartin. “Everyone except 
Jamie Chang and one other per­
son voted against it. Quite 
frankly, it’s just his opinion on 
it, and he wants to make the 
changes for no other reason 
than philosophical beliefs. [If it 
is passed], we will have to add 
to the bylaws to reference the 
fiscal policy, and [that] would 
probably make it more confus­
ing.”
Another concern of some 
Senators is that the fiscal policy 
is ambiguous in some parts. 
That ambiguity partly arises 
from the fact that there are 
three documents referred to as 
the fiscal policy, a situation that 
was created when the Gradu­
ate Student Assembly sepa-

NASA launches modem 
ion propelled spaceship
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)—A 
spacecraft that is equipped with an 
ion engine and can think for itself 
rocketed away from Earth on Satur­
day on a quest to test technologies 
straight out of Star Trek.
NASA’s Deep Space 1 soared through 
clouds aboard an unmanned rocket, 
bound for an asteroid 120 million miles 
away.
The mood was tense as launch con­
trollers awaited word as to whether 
Deep Space 1 was catapulted out of 
Earth’s orbit by the Delta booster as 
planned; the incoming data were un­
readable. Then tracking stations were 
slow to acquire signals from the space­
craft, and engineers had to send com­
mands to make sure the solar wings 
were unfurled.
The good news finally came two hours 
after liftoff: Deep Space 1 was on the 
right course and in good shape. Launch 
controllers applauded and hugged. “We 
can start breathing again,” said NASA 
launch manager Ray Lugo.
The successful morning launch 
kicked off NASA’s New Millennium 
program of “high risk, high payoff’ 
technology missions that the space 
agency hopes will lead to frequent, 
affordable trips into space.
Besides the ion-propulsion engine, 
Deep Space 1 is flying 11 other futuristic 
technologies, including a self-navigat­
ing system, powerful lens-covered solar 
wings, and a radio beacon designed to 
inform ground controllers how the space­
craft is doing without being asked.
‘Deep Space 1 is taking the risks so 
that future missions don’t have to,” said 
Marc Rayman, chief engineer and 
deputy mission manager at the Jet Pro­
pulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
Although ion engines have flown be­
fore, Deep Space 1 is the first deep-space 
probe to rely on such a device for pri­
mary propulsion. Ground controllers 
plan to fire up the engine in a few weeks, 
once they’re sure everything is working.
The ion engine will provide the extra 
kick needed for the drum-shaped
spacecraft, which weighs just over
1,000 pounds, to rendezvous with as­
teroid 1992 KD next July. It will travel 
an estimated 450 million miles before 
catching up with the moving, moun­
tain-sized rock.
The autonomous navigation system 
will guide Deep Space 1, managers 
hope, to within six miles of the asteroid. 
Artificial intelligence in this system 
will allow the spacecraft to take charge 
of some of its own commanding.
If it weren’t for the ion engine, Deep 
Space 1 would need 10 times more fuel 
to reach the asteroid. As it is, the 
spacecraft carries a scant 180 pounds 
of xenon gas to run the engine, reduc­
ing the size of the probe and, conse­
quently, the cost of the mission.
Here’s how the solar-powered ion en­
gine will work: Xenon gas is bombarded 
by electrons. The resulting xenon ions 
are drawn toward high-voltage grids 
and spewed into space at a speed of 
more than 62,000 miles per hour. This 
glowing blue stream of xenon ions is 
what provides the gentle yet constant 
acceleration for months, even years.
“In Star Trek, they refer to ion pro­
pulsion as being even faster than the 
capability that the Enterprise had, 
and NASA isn’t quite ready to fly a 
faster-than-light spacecraft yet,” 
Rayman said, smiling.
But he added: “It’s been known for a 
long time that it has the potential to 
provide very, very high velocity, and 
that aspect of it was accurately re­
flected in Star Trek and is what we’ll 
be doing with Deep Space 1.”
The $152 million mission is sup­
posed to end next September, but will 
continue until 2001 with one or two 
comet encounters if the National Aero­
nautics and Space Administration 
supplies more money.
Deep Space 2, the next New Millen­
nium mission, is scheduled to fly in 
January. Two small soil-penetrating 
probes will be launched aboard the 
Mars Polar Lander and shot into the 
planet’s south pole.
Candidate faces 
murder charges
CROSSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — An 
oddball candidate for the Legislature who 
changed his middle name to (Low Tax) 
was arrested Friday on charges of mur­
dering his opponent, a state Senator who 
championed crime victims’ rights.
Byron Looper, 34, was jailed without 
bail in the slaying of Senator Tommy 
Burks, who was shot at close range in the 
head Monday in a pickup truck on his hog 
farm. At the time, Burks was getting 
ready to take a group of children on a 
hayride and a visit to a pumpkin patch.
Until his arrest at his Cookeville home, 
Looper had not been seen or heard from 
since the slaying.
Police would not discuss a motive or 
say what evidence they had against 
Looper. They refused to comment on TV 
reports in which Looper was seen driv­
ing from the murder scene.
Looper’s lawyer, Lionel Barrett, told 
WHBQ-TV in Memphis that the case is 
bizarre and “almost has the elements of 
a made-for-movie-type situation.”
A strong advocate of victims’ rights, 
Burks was the Senate sponsor of two 
constitutional questions that will ap­
pear on the November 3 ballot. One 
would add a crime victims’ bill of rights 
to the constitution. The other would de­
lete the requirement that state prisons 
be “comfortable.”
Looper got the GOP nomination for 
the state Senate because nobody else 
ran for it. Burks was a heavy favorite 
against Looper.
Democrats are organizing a write- 
in campaign for Burks’ widow, Char­
lotte. But Looper’s name must stay on 
the ballot.
“There’s no particular law that says if 
someone murders their election opponent, 
their name is taken off the ballot,” state 
election coordinator Brook Thompson said. 
“It’s so bizarre and unheard of.”
The state Republican Party urged 
people to not vote for Looper.
Burks’ name was taken off the bal­
lot and Democrats were not allowed to 
put forward another candidate be­
cause the death occurred within 30 
days of the election.
Though Looper was elected to a 
countywide office, few people seemed to
know much about him. He disappeared 
from his job for days at a time, co-work- 
ers said, and kept to himself.
Looper was born in Putnam County 
and attended West Point from 1983 to 
1985, leaving after a knee injury. 
He ran for the Georgia House at 23 
and lost, then worked three years as a 
legislative aide. After working vari­
ous other jobs and attending law school 
in Puerto Rico, he returned to Tennes­
see and lost a race for the state House 
in 1994.
He won the assessor’s seat in 1996 after 
running a highly negative campaign 
against the incumbent. He later legally 
changed his middle name from Anthony 
to (Low Tax), parentheses included.
“I don’t believe he’s nuts,” said Joel 
Reimer, who ran Looper’s campaign 
for assessor. “I believe he is a law 
student that actually believes 
the law can be manipulated to his ad­
vantage.”
Former assistant 
praises President
PITTSBURGH (AP) — Former White 
House spokesman Mike McCurry drew 
cheers and applause Monday when he 
described President Clinton as a “richly 
qualified leader” who was “exasperat- 
ingly stupid” in his personal life.
McCurry, in his first public lecture since 
leaving the White House October 1, spoke 
frankly about his three years as Clinton’s 
spokesman before an audience of about 
200 at the University of Pittsburgh.
When one man asked how McCurry felt 
about leaving the White House after three 
years, McCurry jumped in the air, spread 
his arms wide, and shouted “Free at last!”
McCurry had nothing but praise for 
Clinton’s performance as President, cit­
ing his economic and peacemaking ac­
complishments.
“He is an enormously gifted and richly 
qualified leader for our nation but some­
one who is exasperatingly stupid in his 
personal life,” McCurry said.
History will never forget the Monica 
Lewinsky scandal, he said.
“I think there will be an asterisk next 
to his name in the record books,” he said. 
Clinton’s presidency “will always be 
marred — stained—by the episode with 
Monica Lewinsky.”
He spared no criticism for the White 
House press corps, saying he was “liter­
ally stunned” in many press briefings 
during the Lewinsky scandal when re­
porters failed to ask a single question 
about other issues.
But McCurry admitted he was duped 
by Clinton’s initial public claim that he 
didn’t have an affair with Lewinsky.
“I was aware of the potential for 
deception, but I just didn’t want to 
believe he had the capacity to deceive,” 
McCurry said.
Helicopter spies 
luxurious lifestyle
PITTSBURGH (AP) — Rep. Ron 
Klink’s office says his family was ha­
rassed when his election opponent hired 
a TV news helicopter to shoot video of 
his home.
Mike Turzai, a Republican, said his 
campaign hired NBC-affiliate WPXI’s 
helicopter to show that Klink, a Demo­
crat, had built an expensive home since 
his election victory in 1992.
“Ron Klink, after getting elected to 
Congress, moved into a mansion. And 
we think that’s a legitimate inquiry with 
respect to the voters,” Turzai told a com­
peting TV station.
Klink aide Joseph Brimmeier said 
Friday that Turzai’s tactics terrorized 
the neighborhood. “Ron Klink’s family, 
his two young children, their neighbors 
were scared to death Monday. How would 
you like a helicopter for 45 minutes to an 
hour hovering over your home?” 
Brimmeier said.
Turzai said nothing would come of the 
attempted videotaping because his cam­
paign never got the footage.
But Klink’s son shot footage of the 
helicopter Monday evening, the 
congressman’s office said. WTAE-TV, 
the ABC affiliate in Pittsburgh, broad­
cast that footage on Thursday.
WPXI’s general .manager, John 
Howell, told WTAE the pilot was sup­
posed to be working full-time for the 
station. “We found out the hard way he 
wasn’t,” Howell said.
Klink has raised more than 10 times 
as much money for the election as Turzai 
and enjoys a near 2-to-l registration 
edge in the congressional district in sub­
urban Pittsburgh.
Questions remain after Israeli and Palestinian peace accord signed
JERUSALEM (AP) — Militant 
Jewish settlers threatened Satur­
day to keep the new Middle East 
peace accord from taking effect, 
vowing to try to topple the govern­
ment of Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu for signing it.
Extremist right-wing settlers 
believe Israel’s agreement to cede 
! 13 percent of West Bank land to 
! the Palestinians threatens their 
! very existence.
' Initial settler response to 
Friday’s accord was muted by the 
Jewish Sabbath, which began at 
sundown. But angry outbursts and 
possible street protests were ex­
pected after sundown Saturday.
! Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat and President Clinton 
joined Netanyahu in signing the 
agreement reached during a
marathon nine-day summit at 
Wye Plantation in Maryland.
Most settlers who are obser­
vant Jews did not watch the White 
House ceremony on television 
Friday night because they refrain 
from using appliances or ma­
chines on the Sabbath.
On the Palestinian side, reac­
tion to the agreement was cau­
tious but upbeat.
The three Palestinian dailies 
splashed the signing on their 
front pages Saturday with head­
lines in large, bold type. Edito­
rials said that although many 
Palestinian goals remain unful­
filled, the agreement is a step 
toward peace.
The leading daily Al-Quds, 
which generally reflects the 
thinking of Arafat’s government,
said the accord suggested that 
Netanyahu and his right-wing 
allies are finally accepting the 
reality of Palestinian aspirations.
Some ordinary Palestinians, 
though, were more pessimistic.
“What is an agreement — does 
it mean the settlement at the top 
of the mountain will go away? Or 
that the checkpoint will go away? 
I don’t think so,” said a 25-year- 
old worker named Mohammed as 
he walked down a street in the 
West Bank town of Nablus carry­
ing loaves of bread.
Israel annexed the West Bank 
after capturing it from Jordan in 
1967. The 2,300 square-mile area 
is home to an estimated 1.6 mil­
lion Palestinians and about
155,000 Israelis.
and anger even before the accord 
was signed.
“After they sign the agreement, 
they will continue with these 
bombs. Until they take all the land, 
they will not leave us alone,” said 
Shiran Srur, a 14-year-old girl liv­
ing at Maale Adumin, the West 
Bank’s largest Jewish settlement.
Lawmaker Michael Kleiner, a 
settler leader, said settlers con­
sidered the deal extremely dan­
gerous.
“This small country is giving a 
lot of territory,” he told Israel’s 
Channel Two prior to Friday’s sign­
ing. “We see this as a black day.”
Hard-line settlers believe they 
can stop Netanyahu from carry­
ing out the Israeli withdrawal for 
months, through political maneu-
Jewish settlers expressed fear vering and mass protests.
Earlier this week, settlers dem­
onstrated and blocked roads near 
areas that might come under 
Palestinian control.
Maps for the troop withdrawal 
have not been made public, but it 
is thought the move will isolate 
up to 15 Jewish settlements. The 
settlers are likely to respond by 
trying to expand and reinforce 
those communities.
Such actions would likely spark 
clashes with Palestinians, who are 
already furious over what they 
see as continuous land grabs by 
the settlers.
The settlers are likely to focus 
on the political front, trying to 
bring down Netanyahu’s govern­
ment and force early elections.
Netanyahu’s coalition holds 61 
votes in the 120 member Knesset,
and the erosion of any support 
could be costly.
Opposition parties, however, 
say they will back the accord, 
thus offsetting any “no” votes 
from hard-line members of 
Netanyahu’s coalition.
Netanyahu must also win 
Cabinet approval for the Wye 
agreement. Israeli media have 
said Netanyahu can expect sup­
port from only five of his 16 min­
isters, with four opposed and 
seven undecided.
The withdrawal is supposed to 
occur over 12 weeks, but Hanan 
Porat, a member of the National 
Religious Party and a legislator 
in Netanyahu’s coalition, said last 
week that Netanyahu would be 
unable to pull back troops during 
any election campaign.

50 YEARS AGO — November

ing observance was scheduled 
to begin with ceremonies in the

Students in the upper ten per­

march into the Music Hall.
The agenda included a speech 
by President Doherty and Eu­
gene Dowling, president of the 
Alumni federation.
President Doherty was to 
present the fraternity and so­
rority scholarship cups.
An award was also supposed 
to be given to the freshman 
girl with the highest scholas­
tic average.
25 YEARS AGO — October 
31,1973 — Reverend Jesse Jack­
son came to CMU as a guest lec­
turer for a Power Structures and 
Organizational Activity class. 
Jackson spoke on his beliefs on 
what makes a person powerful.
In addition, he spoke about how 
he thought America’s power 
structure is headed in the wrong 
direction. Jackson also spoke in a 
lecture for the School of Urban 
and Public Affairs on the black 
movement.
10 YEARS AGO— November 
1, 1988 — The Faculty Senate 
considered a proposal to make 
the Computer Science Depart­
ment a separate school. The de­
partment split from Mellon Col­
lege of Science in October, 1985 
because it was too large and de­
manded more funds than the
other departments in the school.
The new school, called the 
School of Computer Science, was 
planned to incorporate the Ro­
botics Institute as well as the 
Information Technology Center.
The school was formed for 
graduate students, while under­
graduate students interested in 
Computer Science had to major 
in applied math, part of the Math­
ematics Department in MCS.
FIVE YEARS AGO — Octo­
ber 25,1993—The United States 
Department of Defense presented 
CMU with a subpoena. The sub­
poena called for all documents 
pertaining to contracts and grants 
between the University and the 
department since July 1, 1986. 
There was a substantial amount 
of paperwork since approximately 
140 of these contracts and grants
had been made over one year 
alone and at least 1,000 had been 
made in the previous six years. 
The Department of Defense de­
clined to comment on the reasons 
for requesting the documents.
ONE YEAR AGO — October 
20, 1997 — The Carnegie 
Mellon University Creative 
Writing department celebrated 
its 30th anniversary with a 
weekend full of readings and 
receptions. The many alumni 
who returned to campus for 
the events read from their 
works and talked with current 
students.
The events lasted three days 
and coincided with CMU’s an­
nual Homecoming celebration.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 26 October 19983Award allows CMU to 
expand biotechnology
By CHRISTINA WONG
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The Pittsburgh Supercomputing Cen­
ter (PSC), a joint effort of Carnegie Mell­
on and the University of Pittsburgh, 
recently received a two-million-dollar 
grant to help fund their efforts to create 
technology which will allow biomedical 
scientists to communicate effectively 
across geographical barriers.
The National Institutes of Health 
gave the award, which the PSC is us­
ing to create tools that will help col­
laborative research overlong distances. 
There are two major biomedical 
projects of PSC that will implement 
these collaborative tools. One of the 
projects consists of two groups which 
will be working together to try to cre­
ate software systems that will be able 
to simulate the movement and struc­
ture of proteins and DNA molecules.
“The idea is to be able to simulate how 
biological molecules like DNA or RNA 
move in a living environment,” said 
Michael Schneider, senior science writer 
and public information liaison. “Most of 
what we’ve learned about proteins is of 
their structure in a crystallized form. 
But inside the [living] body the mol­
ecules are moving around.”
The software systems are named 
AMBER and CHARMM, and various 
scientists will be working together to 
develop these systems using the new 
tools.
“There is someone in California, some­
one [in Pittsburgh], and someone in 
North Carolina. All three of these places 
have, in the past, made improvements 
on the software and have been working 
alone,” said Schneider. “Pretty soon, 
there were three different versions of 
the software,” The new tools will try to 
facilitate communication and have ev­
eryone more closely connected.
According to Sergui Sanielevici, the 
manager of Parallel Applications and 
the person who is heading the effort to 
develop these instruments, the research­
ers will use the instruments to share 
their results with each other. Before
now the researchers would have to visit 
each other and communicate on the tele­
phone or by email. Sanielevici hoped 
that they will be able to collaborate over 
the network using different tools. One 
example of a tool that could be put into 
effect is a shared white board.
“A good commercial example would be 
the free Microsoft product called 
NetMeeting,” said Sanielevici. The white 
board would be a product that would 
allow the researchers to be able to easily 
convey thoughts, information, and ideas 
to each other. They could take turns 
writing on the electronic board or cor­
recting aspects of whatever they were 
looking at.
The plan is to use a controlled environ­
ment to test and develop the software. 
There are many things to consider when 
trying to create these instruments.
For one, the researchers want some­
thing that can be used right away. “The 
practicing scientists tend to perceive any 
new things as nuisances,” said 
Sanielevici. The researchers would not 
want to deal with problems that the 
software might have.
“If the frame rate is slow, if you see 
that the person’s movements are kind of 
choppy, or if you see that the lighting is 
bad, [the product needs to be fixed]” said 
Sanielevici.
For Carnegie Mellon, the projects show 
how the University is trying to direct 
itself to be a leader in biotechnology. 
Christina Gabriel, who is the director of 
Collaborative Initiatives, is a part of the 
group which is partly responsible for 
deciding what direction the University 
takes to stay ahead in the future. “[One 
question we consider is] where can Car­
negie Mellon take a leadership position? 
What’s happening is that biomedical 
research is exploding. People need to do 
more research in that area,” said Gabriel. 
“For Carnegie Mellon, it’s one of the 
many things we can do to connect bio­
medical research with things that we’re 
good at, like computing. I think that any 
university that wants to be world class 
cannot afford to ignore biomedical re­
search.”
Problems plague new system
CENTER, from page 1
agement major, “At other schools that 
have TartanTRAK, they are letting 
students use [TartanTRAK] and an­
other system like Resume Expert as 
well and are bringing [TartanTRAK] 
in slowly.”
According to Alback, several compa­
nies she has spoken with are avoiding 
TartanTRAK, which she believes is a 
disadvantage to students.
Fowler addressed student com­
plaints through an email message to 
the campus community last Wednes­
day. The message was sent to college 
consultants and associate deans of 
colleges, who were to disseminate the 
information through the individual 
college distribution lists. The message, 
however, has only been forwarded to 
certain students in CIT and SCS.
In the message, Fowler agrees that 
one of the primary problems of the 
new system is speed, and he explains 
that the other is security. According to 
the message, JobTRAK is increasing 
server capacities and InterviewTRAK, 
the part of the system that schedules 
campus interviews, has been allocated 
its own servers. The East and West 
Coast schools, furthermore, have been
divided to facilitate faster connections. 
“Three to four weeks ago there were a lot 
of problems with JobTRAK,” said Fowler. 
“Since that time, each week has gotten 
faster and more efficient. There are times 
during the day that there are so many 
jobs that it takes longer to download.”
The system’s integrity is another ma­
jor concern for students because stu­
dents are required to divulge personal 
and academic information, including the 
first eight digits of their social security 
numbers for first-time entry into the 
system. “The database does not use the 
security numbers. Obviously they are a 
bonded company and are legally respon­
sible. If the numbers got out, it would be 
the death of JobTRAK,” said Fowler.
Another problem encountered with the 
system is that the user name and pass­
word appear on the Web browser URL 
line. Fowler suggests that students hide 
the URL input line, so other individuals 
do not see the information. If the user 
name and password is obtained by an­
other individual, they can log on and 
alter other users’ information. This is 
not a permanent fix to the situation, 
however, because the usernames and 
passwords travel across the network as 
unencrypted text which can be easily
obtained by others.
Fowler’s message also explains that 
some employers have altered their cam­
pus recruitment plans because of the 
problems encountered with the Career 
Center. Despite this, there has been an 
increase in the number of employers re­
cruiting on campus by 10 percent and an; 
increase in on-campus interviews by 25' 
percent, according to Fowler’s message.
CMU is not paying JobTRAK for the 
service and is not receiving compensa­
tion for its use. JobTRAK is financed 
privately through national employers, 
separate from campus recruiters. CMU 
did pay, however, for the use of Resume 
Expert in past years, making JobTRAK 
a technologically advanced and finan­
cially feasible system.
“It is absolutely clear that 
TartanTRAK provides vastly superior 
service than Resume Expert, and that, 
in large part due to the patience and 
decency of our students and employers, 
the net impact of this rough transition 
on our overall recruiting effort has been 
significantly minimized,” said Fowler in 
his message to the campus. “It is our 
goal that every senior is registered to 
use JobTRAK by next year.”
Bylaws revision controversy persists
BYLAWS, from page 1
rated from Student Senate last year.
Chang said that the changes that 
have been proposed do not address that 
ambiguity, but he does not feel that 
there is reason to oppose the changes.
“This is just a pointless redirection 
of the question,” said Chang. “Whether 
the fiscal policy needs revision is not 
being debated. Also, the policy was 
just revised last session.... I am hard 
pressed, personally, to find a reason to 
already start second-guessing the work 
that we did just half a year ago.”
Debate over these and other con­
cerns has continued since Chang made 
a preliminary announcement of the 
proposal on the Student Senate bboard. 
Monroe was surprised that the pro­
posal presented at the last Senate
meeting was not different than the one 
posted earlier and that it did not address 
the problems that people had.
“In its current form, I won’t vote for it, 
but it’s hard to say [if it will pass],” said 
Monroe. “Some people haven’t expressed 
opinions on it, so it’s hard to tell. The 
thing is that [Chang] said that it was 
only a cosmetic Change.”
“I’m going to vote against it... because 
I think it’s just busy work,” said 
McCartin. “It’s more that Jamie Chang’s 
Human Relations Committee feels a need 
to continually change the bylaws rather 
than just let them work.”
The second proposal made to Student 
Senate has to do with the Activities 
Board (AB) and its relationship with 
Senate. Chang said that the need for the 
amendment has grown out of the fact
that over time, and with the addition of 
other amendments to the bylaws, the, 
section dealing with AB has grown cryp­
tic and out of date.
“There are two major changes,” said 
Chang. “The first is the inclusion of the 
purpose of the Activities Board. The ma­
jor clarification there being that AB is an 
external committee of Student Senate,' 
which it has been since its inception. The; 
second clarification is on how AB is bud­
geted. Although the understanding has. 
always been that AB would be budgeted 
through the Joint Funding Committee... 
this amendment makes it explicit.”
This second proposed change has not 
met with as much opposition as the first. 
Both are due to be re-read to Senate at 
the next meeting on November 11. Each 
will be voted on separately at that time.;
Lecture series honors faculty
SERIES, from page 1
ing students in the research pro­
cess is the key to a research 
university’s success. He cited 
CMU’s buggy races as a good ex­
ample of students whose curios­
ity drives them to learn. By figur­
ing out what makes their buggies 
more aerodynamic and by work­
ing to improve them, students 
are learning as a result of their 
own curiosity.
“Good teachers teach students 
to be happy learners,” Simon 
said. By a “happy learner,” he 
didn’t mean a student who smiles 
in class, but one who has a curi­
osity about the world around 
them and who wants to pursue 
that curiosity. To do this, he said,
teachers not only need to be up to 
date in their field but also need 
to use their own knowledge of 
research to help students solve 
problems. In an ideal university 
setting, teachers are concerned 
with how graduates go through 
life in a world where knowledge 
doesn’t stand still.
Simon said that CMU is an 
innovator among research uni­
versities in that it seeks to under­
stand the learning and teaching 
process. Faculty members use 
research to help the students 
learn and to improve the way 
things are done at the university. 
Because of this, both students 
and faculty benefit from the re­
search of learning processes.
Saturday’s lecture was actu­
ally Simon’s second Last Lecture. 
Simon has been at Carnegie Mell­
on since 1949 and has been a 
member of the Board of Trustees 
since 1972. Aside from his work 
in the Psychology Department, 
Simon has worked with the Phi­
losophy Department as well as 
Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration. He has won 
many prestigious awards 
throughout his lengthy career, 
including the Nobel Prize in Eco­
nomics in 1978, and is a fellow in 
an impressive number of aca­
demic societies. Simon is cur­
rently researching artificial in­
telligence and computer simula­
tion of human thinking.
Crime and Incident Report
10/17 OPEN LEWDNESS,
9:55 pm — Twice earlier in the 
evening a Campus Police officer 
saw males come out of the dining 
room of a fraternity, walk over to 
a tree on their patio, and urinate 
on it in public view. The officer 
took no enforcement action at the 
time because the actors ran into 
the house before he could ap­
proach them.
When the officer saw another 
male do the same, the officer 
along with another officer en­
tered the patio and demanded 
to see a house officer. They ex­
plained the actions they had 
seen and issued the house an 
internal citation. They warned 
the president that if they ob­
served any further offenses of 
this nature and if the offending 
individual were caught» that he 
would not be cited but arrested 
under the misdemeanor charge 
of open lewdness.
10/18 CRIMINAL MIS­
CHIEF, 1:45 am — A fraternity 
brother was draining his 
waterbed out his window with a 
garden hose when he heard his 
window break. He looked out his 
window and saw a male looking 
up at him and laughing. He con­
tacted Campus Police to report 
the incident.
While making the final round 
of the fraternity patrol, three of­
ficers saw a male fitting the de­
scription that the brother pro­
vided. They detained the actor. 
The victim positively identified 
the actor as the individual who 
broke his window. Since the actor 
was a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, 
he was issued a Pennsylvania 
non-traffic citation for criminal 
mischief.
10/18 FAILURE TO COM­
PLY, 3:31 am — An officer re­
sponded to a fight call. When he 
arrived at the fraternity, two of­
ficers were already there order­
ing the fraternity brothers back 
into their respective houses. All 
the fraternities complied with­
out incident except one. The offic­
ers gave the offending brothers a 
second request. When they still 
did not go inside, the officers is­
sued the fraternity an internal 
citation for a failure to disperse. 
They gave the citation to the 
fraternity’s president.
10/22 INDECENT EXPO­
SURE, 7:01 pm — A CMU stu­
dent was walking on Morewood
Avenue and stopped to assist a 
motorist in a dirty, green com­
pact vehicle requesting help. He 
asked her for directions to 
Schenley Park, which she gave 
him. While talking to the mus- 
tached motorist, he kept asking 
her to approach the vehicle. When 
she did, she noticed him breath­
ing quickly and saw his hand 
moving in his lap as if he were 
masturbating. The actor then 
stated that he was looking for the 
“Blowjob Festival” in Schenley 
Park. The victim began to walk 
away from the actor. Then the 
victim heard a car door open and 
close, and she began to run away 
without looking back to see if the 
actor was following her.
She contacted Campus Police, 
and officers came to her Amberson 
Apartments residence to take the 
report. Two officers guarded the 
parking lot as this occurred. While 
on this watch assignment, the 
officers were approached by who 
they believed was the actor. The 
green four-door Chevrolet Cava­
lier matched the victim’s descrip­
tion. When the officers ap­
proached the vehicle, the person 
driving the vehicle fled, but not 
before the officers could note the 
license plate number.

4The Tartan • Camegie Mellon University • 26 October 1998New dean must meet diverse needs of SCS
COMMITTEE, from page 1
strengths, find potential areas where 
we could improve, and lay the ground­
work for the dean search committee.” 
The end product of the committee was a 
document stating what SCS is and how 
it has changed in the past decade of 
being a school.
; The dean search committee, formed 
this fall, will use this document to show 
potential dean candidates that SCS has 
grown significantly in the past decade 
and that it is also a very broad-based 
school. “We want somebody who will 
have the big picture [in mind and] help 
to develop the vision for the entire 
school,” said professor of computer sci­
ence Randal Bryant, co-chair of the dean 
search committee.
SCS combines Computer Science, Au­
tomated Learning and Discovery, Hu- 
man-Computer Interaction, Language 
Technology, Robotics, and Software En­
gineering into one school.
“We need to find someone with a broad 
appreciation for computing, and [with] 
strong abilities for collaboration with 
many other areas,” said Thorpe.
Currently the dean search committee 
is looking for candidates outside of Car­
negie Mellon University. The commit­
tee has made a list of characteristics for 
the new dean, and these have been made
available to the entire University 
through the SCS bboard.
“Candidates are likely to be well-es­
tablished and unwilling to let their cur­
rent organization know that they are 
considering leaving,” said James 
Tomayko, principal lecturer for com­
puter science and a member of the 
search committee.
This makes a search for a new dean 
more complicated than a search for a 
department head would be. Since the 
SCS undergraduate program is run 
through a department head, under­
graduate students do not have direct 
interaction with the dean; therefore, 
there is no student on the search com­
mittee. “The dean is more historically 
oriented toward the research level of 
education,” said Bryant.
By next spring the committee hopes to 
have found an appropriate person to 
become the next dean of SCS. The ulti­
mate decision on a new dean will be 
made by Christiano and President 
Cohon.
“I don’t like to think in terms of ‘re­
placing’ Reddy,” said Thorpe. “We can 
find a successor, but not a replacement. 
He consistently generates visionary 
ideas, and his enthusiasm and leader­
ship have set a high standard for re­
search in the school.”
Use of roofies grows at CMU
ROOFIES, from page 1
ary measures.
“Swift University and criminal ac­
tion will follow from possession, use, 
or administration of the drug to an­
other person,” said Murphy. “Involve­
ment with these drugs constitutes a 
felony, and we will pursue the harsh­
est criminal action possible. Univer­
sity action would certainly include 
expulsion.”
Sexual Assault advisors posted a 
flier about the incident that warns 
students of Rohypnol, GHB (known as 
liquid X), Ketamine (known as special 
K), and Burundanga. Rohypnol, GHB, 
and Ketamine are illegal in the United 
States but have been illegally 
smuggled into the country for a num­
ber of years through Mexico.
“[The drugs] are most accessible in 
Mexico,” said senior psychology major 
Maria Muti, who is the gender issues 
intern at Health Services. “Schools in 
the South have been dealing with this 
for a while, maybe 10 years.”
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency 
(DEA) has noted an increase in the 
use of Rohypnol in Texas and South 
Florida, where it has been used by 
high school students along with alco­
hol and cocaine.
The drugs are typically white and 
odorless and can be combined with
alcohol to increase their effects. One of 
the most common ways of giving the 
drug to someone is by putting it in their 
drink while they are not paying atten­
tion or by preparing the drink for them 
and putting it in then. Food or anything 
else that can be eaten can also be used to 
give the drug to someone. The drugs 
have earned reputations as “date rape 
drugs” because they can be given with­
out a person’s knowledge and cause them 
to lose consciousness, rendering them 
defenseless.
According to Director of Health Ser­
vices Anita Barkin, there is a small 
window of opportunity in which thay 
can detect these drugs. Some are washed 
out of -urine the first time a person uses 
the bathroom, and blood tests only work 
up to 72 hours later.
Currently, there are at least three 
organizations set up to handle these 
incidents. Campus police, Health Ser­
vices, and Sexual Assault Advisors have 
all received complaints. However, it is 
difficult for them to know if the same 
people are going to more than one of 
them for help, or just one.
“I met with Dean Murphy earlier this 
week to improve communication between 
Campus Police, Health Services, Dean 
Murphy, and myself,” said Muti. “I feel 
that if we improve our communication 
we can work better.... My main concern
is that people are aware of them. We 
don’t want people to not go to parties 
or to cause a panic.”
Campus Police, Heath Services, and 
Sexual Assault Advisors have com­
piled a list of things that students can 
do to protect themselves. They include 
watching one’s drinks, not accepting 
open drink containers, and not drink­
ing anything with an unusual taste or 
appearance.
Students should also report any in­
cidents where they suspect these drugs 
have been used.
“In order for us to investigate the 
sources of drug distribution, students 
need to come forward and report inci­
dents to either the Student Health 
Services, Campus Police, or the Sexual 
Assault Advisors,” said Barkin. “Re­
ports made to the Health Services are 
held in strict confidence. If the inci­
dent is reported within 72 hours, urine 
drug screens can be sent at no cost to 
the student.”
“If someone has firsthand informa­
tion, we may need their testimony to 
pursue those involved, but we will not 
force them to participate in such an 
action without their cooperation,” said 
Murphy. “The bottom line is we need 
students who have knowledge to step 
forward and help us solve this risk to 
the community.”
Petition begins for new program in Asian Studies in H&SS
DIVERSITY, from page 1
ever, we have improved a great deal.”
; Each semester a number of students at 
CMU go to the University of Pittsburgh 
in order to take classes that have not 
been offered here. “I am embarrassed 
when we have to send students to the 
[University of Pittsburgh],” said Steams. 
¦ According to Tyagi, in a Hindi lan­
guage course at Pitt this semester, the 
number of CMU students outnumbers 
£itt students eight to seven. He said 
that taking classes at Pitt is difficult 
because CMU students have problems 
with transportation and fitting classes 
into their schedules.
I Tyagi became interested in increas­
ing international diversity within the 
curriculum last January when he vis­
ited a South Asian Student Alliance 
conference in Atlanta, Ga. The meeting 
involved a number of South Asian stu­
dent organizations from universities 
around the country, and curricular di­
versity was one issue that came up. 
Tyagi hopes that in the future CMU 
will offer a selection of diverse courses 
that will reflect the already diverse 
student body.
Tyagi feels the main problem to date 
is that students have not vocalized and 
been united in their interest in starting 
new courses. In addition to the survey, 
he hopes to discuss these issues with 
other cultural organizations like Spriit,' 
ASA, and HKSA. He is specifically in­
terested in seeing courses implemented 
in the Hindi and Urdu languages. In 
addition, he said that he would like to 
see a course dealing with South Asian 
philosophy and religion, as well as a 
course in South Asian history. “My 
main interest is promoting South Asian 
culture,” he said, “but I would also like
to see any additional courses dealing 
with Asia and Africa.”
Stearns said that in order for these 
new courses to be started, there would 
need to be new sources of funding for 
H&SS. Once this is done, the depart­
ment would need to explore which new 
courses to add based on interest. The 
Modern Language Department is cur­
rently focusing its financial resources 
on broadening the current Chinese lan­
guage program to enable students to 
earn a major in the language. The 
program has recently taken on more 
faculty, which incurs more expenses. 
Due to financial limitations placed on 
the department, new language courses 
are not currently very feasible. Stearns 
said that history courses would be 
easier to start, since they don’t require 
that new full-time faculty be hired. He 
also said that a course in Indian his­
tory would be likely in the future and 
would be even more possible with in­
creased student interest.
One student, Bhumika Muchhala, a 
junior double major in professional writ­
ing and public policy and management, 
also advocates a more diverse curricu­
lum. She wrote a proposal last year to 
expand the breadth of international 
courses offered at CMU in a class. She 
pointed out that though the student 
population comes from a number of dif­
ferent backgrounds, most of the classes 
at CMU are very Anglocentric.
“Because CMU doesn’t put as much 
effort into the liberal arts, it does not feel 
that it needs to complete with schools 
who do,” said Muchhala. “There isn’t 
enough incentive. A large amount of 
students need to support the effort.”
Muchhala noted that in a global world 
it is important not to lose sight of the
variety of cultures that exist today and 
that it is necessary to provide education 
to prevent this from happening.
Tyagi, Muchhala, and Stearns agreed 
that promoting curricular diversity 
would benefit students greatly. Tyagi, 
in addition, believes that broadening 
the curriculum would also increase the 
University’s prestige, “A school that is 
lacking in diversity is not a full service 
school,” said Tyagi. “Camegie Mellon is 
not a full service school with regards to 
humanities.”
Both the current Japanese and Chi­
nese programs were started because of 
student interest. Tyagi hopes that the 
survey will show enough interest to ex­
pand the curriculum. “If we go to the 
administration with numbers, then we 
can have an influence,” said Tyagi. “If 
[the survey] doesn’t work, I’ll just have 
to find something else.”Student Senate Minutes

Student Body President (Sa­
rah Gross):
In the last couple of weeks, I 
attended various meetings such 
as the Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day Program Planning Commit­
tee meeting. We are currently 
looking for a graduate and un­
dergraduate speaker. Please let 
me know if you (or anyone you

help them recover past deficits. I 
have also dealt with similar tasks 
in other organizations including 
rectifying mismanagement of 
money problems.
Committee Reports:
Academic Affairs (Amy Ng):
AA is drafting a report on ad­
vising for the UEC on October 30, 
and will be issuing the report to 
Senate on November 11th. Cur­
rently there are varying advising 
models with no specified role be­
tween the advisor and the stu­
dent. Our report will define stu­
dent expectations of advisors.
I met with Dean Paul Fowler 
from the Career Center to discuss 
an update on the JobTrak issue. 
Senate is still working with the 
Career Center to make the issue 
of security one of top priority.
As part of an initiative to en­
courage Senators to be more in­
volved in their home colleges 
and departments, the Academic 
Affairs Committee would like to 
ask all Senators to (1) find out if 
there is a SAC in your depart­
ment or college (2) contact the 
student members, inform them 
on the issues that Senate is 
working on, and discuss with 
them the issues the SAC is work­
ing on.
Campus Affairs (Neil Guzy):
I had a meeting concerning the 
renovation of the old gymnasium. 
The committee is looking for new 
ways to improve communication 
on campus. We also discussed 
ways to improve homecoming.
Funding and Recognition
(Sern Tham): F&R will be pre­
senting two special allocations. 
There are 134 organizations 
appling for re-recognition and
about 64 organizations have not 
responded. Therefore, the dead­
line for re-recognition has been 
extended for a week.
Human Resources (Jamie 
Chang): The committee will con­
tinue discussions on revising the 
bylaws.
If anyone has ideas, please 
email them to myself or the Hu­
man Resources dlist, +dist+/afs / 
an drew / org / senate / HR / 
human, dl.
In addition, HR will also be 
looking into knowledge transfer 
between sessions of Senate and 
systems for more efficient use of 
organizational resources.
Direct any questions concern­
ing the Human Resources Com­
mittee or its issues to me at 
chang@andrew.cmu.edu or call 
X2-2695.
Public Relations (Joshua 
Merry): The committee is prepar­
ing for the election. We are going 
to put a full-color page advertise­
ment in the Tartan to publicize 
the election. However, because 
Sen. Sern has extended the re­
recognition deadline, we have to 
postpone the plan. For the elec­
tion day, we also have the idea of 
chalking on the sidewalks. Sen­
ate happy hour is on November
11 from 4-6 pm.
Chair (Drew Stovall):
New Business from Commit­
tee:
F98-011-Amendment of the 
Student Senate bylaws to make 
fiscal policy a separate document. 
Whereas the functions of the Stu­
dent Senate bylaws and of the 
fiscal policy are separate and dif­
ferent, and whereas the fiscal 
policy, as a policy, more properly 
belongs in a different document, 
and whereas the Student Senate
bylaws are simplified by this act, 
and whereas this act would make 
fiscal policy a concise, self-con- 
fined. document that is practical 
for the Funding and Recognition 
Committee and the organizations 
with which it deals to utilize; 
Resolved, by the fall 1998 session 
of the Student Senate, to adopt a 
separate fiscal policy, un­
amended, and amend the Stu­
dent Senate bylaws to strike all 
of Article III and renumber the 
articles as necessary.
F98-012-Amendment of the 
Student Senate Bylaws to modify 
Article IV: Student-Government- 
Administrated Organizations, 
whereas the Activities Board has 
special status as an external com­

therefore requires special rules, 
and whereas the changes in Stu­
dent Government have caused 
modifications in the Senate By­
laws, and whereas the relation­
ship between Student Senate and 
the Activities Board requires 
some clarification, Resolved, by 
the Fall 1998 session of Student 
Senate, to strike Article IV of the 
Student Senate bylaws and in­
sert the following text: IV. The

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University26 October 1998
Festival needs better 
planning, publicity
For eight years, Carnegie 
Mellon’s International Festival 
has turned a fall weekend into an 
exploration of the cultures of other 
countries. While the International 
Festival provides a unique oppor­
tunity to experience interesting 
cultures, the Student Activities- 
sponsored event seems to have 
stalled in growth. With more em­
phasis on pre-event publicity and 
more interactive events, the In­
ternational Festival could become 
a weekend that the University 
community looks forward to al­
most as much as Carnival.
Those who walked through the 
University Center last weekend 
couldn’t help noticing the many 
balloons, posters and flags dis­
played for the International Festi­
val ’98: Europe. But some impor­
tant pre-weekend publicity that 
has been an integral part of past 
International Festivals was miss­
ing this year. For example, two 
years ago, in preparation for the 
weekend’s festival about Latin 
America, brightly colored wooden 
signs were placed along the Cut 
weeks in advance. Schedules of 
events accompanied by extra in­
formation about the weekend’s 
events and participants were also 
distributed weeks before the event. 
This year’s festival lacked impor­
tant publicity methods like these.
Student Activities could also 
heighten pre-weekend publicity 
by developing an extensive Web 
site linked to the CMUhome page. 
The current International Festi­
val Web page includes little more
than a schedule of events and a 
list of countries within the 
festival’s scope. If the site included 
speaker biographies, pictures, and 
perhaps some history behind the 
International Festival many more 
people on and off campus would 
have had access to information 
about the weekend in advance.
According to event organizers, 
the last three International Festi­
vals have had about the same num­
ber of attendees. One reason for 
this might be because the festival’s 
events have become largely focused 
on lectures instead of interactive 
activities. This year’s events are 
more centered around listening to 
people share their experiences 
with different cultures instead of 
directly experiencing those cul­
tures. The lectures were well at­
tended but they weren’t as popu­
lar as events such as the tribute 
band or dance performances. If 
more activities such as these were 
part of the weekend festivities, the 
International Festival could begin 
building a larger audience.
Over the years the International 
Festival has provided an oppor­
tunity to examine and enjoy as­
pects of various cultures. The 
growth of an event like this can 
only strengthen CMU and lead to 
a better awareness for all who 
attend. With better publicity and' 
more emphasis on programming, 
Student Activities and the Uni­
versity as a whole can make the 
International Festival a weekend 
that everyone looks forward to for 
the entire year.Mail system fails to 
satisfy student needs
From its hours of operation to its 
package notification method, the 
CMU mail system fails to satisfy 
the needs of students. Officials 
should restructure the current 
operations of the postal offices at 
CMU to provide better service.
The mailroom is open weekdays 
from 9 am to 6 pm when classes 
are in session and students are 
busy with extracurricular activi­
ties or jobs. This makes it difficult 
for students who have important 
packages to pick up but no time to 
do so. The only time left during 
the week to pick up packages is 
from 12-3 pm on Saturdays, but 
there is no package pick up at 
some mail rooms during this time. 
Those locations that offer Satur­
day package pick up sometimes 
cannot operate for a full three 
hours because the mail carrier 
must rotate between mailrooms 
such as Donner and West Wing.
Some campus mailrooms have 
implemented an email notifica­
tion system for those with pack­
ages. This is a welcome improve­
ment in the efficiency of the 
mailrooms, and it should be ex­
panded to cover all campus 
mailrooms.
Students working in the 
mailrooms consistently make mis­
takes with misaddressed mail. 
Instead of emailing the student 
whose name is on the mail and 
asking them to pick up the item in 
a centralized location, postal 
workers delay handling 
misaddressed mail problems and 
sometimes students never receive 
mail intended for them. A sign on

the door of the Morewood 
mailroom states that students 
should make sure that their mail 
is correctly addressed to them or 
it may take them.weeks to get it. 
This is a poor excuse for a prob­
lem that is usually not a student’s 
fault. A better solution would be 
letting students keep the same 
mailbox for four years to elimi­
nate mail forwarding hassles and 
mistakes in address information.
Mail delivery is also a problem. 
Students who receive magazines 
have reported not getting their 
subscription because the maga­
zine is too large to fit into campus 
mailboxes. In dorms such as 
Mudge, magazines are either 
mangled to fit in the box or the 
student just never receives it. 
Even worse than a student not 
getting mail is having that mail 
turn up in another student’s mail­
box. This mistake is bound to hap­
pen once in a while, but it is a 
consistent mistake with the CMU 
postal system. Even scarier is that 
post office box combinations are 
not changed from year to year, so 
students can revisit their old 
mailboxes and open them even if 
they no longer occupy them.
The solutions to these problems 
require a overhaul of the mail 
system at CMU. Perhaps a cen­
tralized package pick-up location 
is necessary or better training for 
student mailroom staff. Unless 
some solutions are implemented 
quickly, however, these and other 
problems will continue to aggra­
vate students who deserve effec­
tive mail service.
Alum criticizes 
Holocaust article
Editor:
As an alum, it really 
disappoints me when 
I see The Tartan 
peddle editorials such 
as Nick Fox-Gieg’s re­
cent “ Jewish-bom nun 
raises Holocaust issues,” [10/19]. The 
biggest problem with the column is not 
its shoddy journalism; its main problem 
is that Mr. Fox-Gieg didn’t get the facts 
straight. Given that, the column was a 
thinly veiled attempt at Catholic-bash­
ing—the last socially acceptable form of 
prejudice left in this country.
It’s been only in the last 35 years that 
conventional folklore has accued Pius 
XII of “silence” during the Holocaust. 
This myth was created after the staging 
of Rolf Hochhuth’s play “The Deputy” in 
1963. However, that’s not what others 
were saying at the time, including the 
World Jewish Congress, the American 
Jewish Committee, Golda Meir, Albert 
Einstein, and many others — all of whom 
noted and applauded Pius XII’s efforts to 
save the Jews. Space limits my reply 
here, but a careful study of the facts 
would reveal that myth to be a callous lie.
Pope John Paul said that the feast of 
St. Theresa Benedicta/Edith Stein 
should be an occasion for Catholics to 
recall the Holocaust, “that terrible plan 
to eliminate a people — a plan which 
cost the lives of millions of our Jewish 
brothers and sisters.” Toward that end, 
the Holy Father said, “for the love of God 
and of man, once again, profoundly 
moved, I raise my voice to cry, ‘Never 
again let there be such a criminal initia­
tive, for any ethnic group, any people, 
any race, anywhere in the world!’ ”
The Pope also dwelt at length on the 
philosophical work of Edith Stein, em­
phasizing her contributions to the proper 
understanding of human reason. Cau­
tioning against the assumption that 
“truth is the opinion held by the greatest 
number of people,” he said that “truth 
and love require one another.” Edith 
Stein, he said, had taugjit: “Do not ac­
cept anything as truth if it lacks love; 
and do not accept as love anything which 
lacks truth.” A very fitting piece of ad­
vice, especially considering Nick Fox- 
Gieg’s column.

Librarian replies 
to Hunt editorial
SE
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
Thank you for rec­
ognizing the improve­
ments we are making 
in the University Li­
braries [“Library staff 
deserves praise for 
improvements,” 10/5]. The changes that 
you mentioned (notably, reconfiguration 
of the Hunt Library reference area and 
the addition of instruction space) are 
just a few of the alterations that we are 
making to benefit library users. Among 
these are a more assertive campaign to 
inform users about existing library re­
sources. For instance, as you pointed
out, liaison librarians are valuable but 
underutilized sources of information for 
students and faculty. We are also dedi­
cated to involving users in decisions that 
will effect the development of library 
facilities and resources. A “Library User 
Survey,” soliciting opinions and infor­
mation about library use from a random 
sample of 1,400 members of the commu­
nity, is now underway — one of several 
ongoing efforts to identify problems 
and priorities.
In recent focus groups and meetings 
with users, we have identified several 
priorities that are shared by students, 
faculty, and research staff. All library 
users indicate the need to increase the 
quantity of available resources, whether 
electronic or print. Enhanced privileges 
within the Oakland Library Consortium 
are also a priority, and users also re­
quest continued improvement of library 
services and facilities. We will measure 
our success in addressing these priori­
ties with continued benchmarking mea­
sures, surveys, focus groups with stu­
dents, and conversations with faculty 
and staff.
Interested readers may review the 
Libraries’ current Strategic Plan, on the 
Web at www.library.cmu.edu /Librar­
ies / sp.html.
Our strategic plan includes reflection 
on alternatives for library collections 
and services, summarizes our focus, out­
lines the external and internal factors 
that have contributed to current plan­
ning, and lists projected goals and strat­
egies (under headings “Create the Digi­
tal Library,” “Target the Right Informa­
tion,” “Retool Library Facilities for the 
21st Century,” and “Manage the Librar- 
ies Effectively”).
We welcome a continuing dialogue 
with library users. Please contact us 
with any comments or concerns about 
Carnegie Mellon library collections 
and services.

UC officials want 
stolen art back
Editor:
We are very sad­
dened that a member 
or guest of the campus 
community saw fit to 
remove an artistic 
sketch hanging in the 
University Center. We have engaged in 
a concerted effort over the past several 
months to highlight student and faculty 
art throughout the building. This has 
proven to be a delightful addition to the 
ambience in the center. Many faculty 
and students have volunteered to show 
their works, undoubtedly without a con­
cern that this might put them at risk. 
Someone has violated that trust, and it 
is likely others witnessed the event or 
have subsequently become aware of it. 
We urge all caring members of this com­
munity to do whatever is in your power 
to right this wrong. If you are able to 
effect the return of this piece of a sketch 
depicting Lili Vanessi—Kiss Me Kate — 
from a larger set of 12 displayed, we 
would appreciate it. If you could share 
your own dismay over this act with oth-

munity in the fullest sense must 
not tolerate such callous acts of theft 
or destruction.
If found, please return the art work to

Campus groups 
confuse students

efa| Editor:
I am an interna­
tional student who 
ipffo ip to happens to work in the
.. c ... Office of International
tne Editor Education (OIE), and 
I am co-president of the International 
Relations Organization (IRO) and a 
member of the International Student 
Union (ISU). What do all these groups 
have in common? You guessed it, they’re 
“international!” Just because these 
groups have the word “international” in 
their titles, does not mean that they are 
all the same, or even connected to each 
other! I’d like to point out the difference 
between these groups:
The Office of International Education 
(OIE) is an administrative'office under 
the wing of Student Affairs. The Foreign 
Student Advisors, Foreign Scholar Ad­
visor, and the Study Abroad Advisor 
work in this office. Services offered in­
clude foreign student and scholar advis­
ing, consulting on visa and immigration 
issues, admission and orientation of for­
eign and exchange students, and advis­
ing for all students interested in study­
ing abroad.
The International Relations Organi­
zation (IRO) is a Student Senate-recog­
nized club for all students of Carnegie 
Mellon who are interested in Model 
United Nations and international af­
fairs, politics, and economics. IRO is run 
by students, is overseen by a faculty 
advisor, and is riot funded or advised by 
the Office of International Education!
The International Student Union (ISU) 
is another Student Senate-recognized 
club for all students of Carnegie Mellon, 
and naturally includes all interested 
foreign students as members. This group 
arranges social, cultural, and educa­
tional events for all members.
ISU helps at International Orienta­
tion, and receives advising from the For­
eign Student Advisors.
Other “international” groups:
The International Spouses and Part­
ners’ Organization is organized by the 
Graduate Foreign Student Advisor. The 
organization provides events for inter­
national spouses to meet, and activities 
for them to do. The organization is funded 
by the GSA.
The Intercultural Communication 
Centre (ICC) provides a writing clinic 
for students with difficulty in the En­
glish language. It is open to U.S. stu­
dents as well as international students. 
It is an administrative office, which is 
under the Provost’s Office.
I hope that everyone will now be aware 
of the differences of these groups and 
stop confusing them all.

Voter apathy indicates satisfaction with status quo
Y-Carent wotk
Elections are coming up. This means 
we all get our chance at electing one of 
the ruling class to, well, rule. I would 
like to encourage everyone to stay home 
and not vote. Why get out of your com­
fortable chair in front of the television 
only to journey to some elementary school 
gym to fill out a piece of paper that 
really, in the end, doesn’t count? Stay 
home — nothing you do on election night 
is going to change your life. Those boring 
television programs aren’t going to get 
any better.
Me, I’m going to vote. Last time we 
had presidential elections, the turnout 
was something like 33 percent. Records 
show that elections for state and local 
offices show a similar turnout rate. Think 
about that. That means only a third of 
the people are voting. That means my 
vote counts for triple. It’s as though I’m 
voting for three people. Triple the power, 
imagine that! If even fewer people vote, 
say 25 percent, I’ll quadruple my power! 
Soon, I’ll rule the country, and I’ll have 
your apathy to thank. Yes, it’s always 
the little people.
I’d like to propose a new scheme for 
running elections. The implicit assump­
tion when people don’t vote is that they 
don’t mind things the way they are. In 
newly democratic countries, the turn­
out is nearly 100 percent. People vote 
because they think they can make a 
difference. Here, we have low turnout 
not because we take democracy for 
granted or something, but rather be­
cause we really can’t make a difference. 
Corporate donations to the major politi­
cal parties dwarf the money they receive
“Vote with your apathy. Stay 
home, and let the rich people 
and corporations who control 
the money run the world. ”
from individual citizens who contribute 
in smaller amounts. Predictably, both 
parties serve very similar interests, and 
there are few radical opinions repre­
sented because, really, no one with any 
money cares about them.
Therefore, my new scheme is that, 
unless the voter turnout is over 50 per­
cent, the incumbent office holder auto­
matically retains his or her position. 
More specifically, more than 50 percent 
of voters have to want someone else in 
order for the incumbent to be booted.
And this overrides the presidential two- 
term limit deal.
A majority of 33 percent of Americans is 
not the same as a majority of Americans, 
and if we consider it so, we’re being un­
democratic — remember “majority rules?” 
Let’s say a majority of the voter turnout 
wanted Dole for president in the last presi­
dential election. Even if it had been unani­
mous, that would have been 33 percent of 
the people who said that. Is it fair for 33 
percent of the people in this 
country to run things? What 
about the majority, the other 
67 percent? Obviously, they 
didn’t mind the way things 
were. For as long as there’s 
no majority callingfor change, 
things should stay exactly the 
way they are. Got a voter turn­
out of 25 percent? Incumbent 
stays in office. It’s clear that people don’t 
mind the way things are being run — we 
shouldn’t bother them and make them have 
to waste precious time saying, “Yes, things 
are fine. Please keep it that way.” The fact 
that they don’t vote or do anything means 
that their world is as good as they’ll ever 
want it.
Vote with your apathy. Stay home, and 
let the rich people and corporations who 
control the money run the world. They 
provide you with everything. Don’t you
have everything you need? No one in the
world lives like us. Sure, you don’t have 
everything you could ever want, but you’re 
well taken care of. A wide selection of food, 
clothing, and television. If there is anything 
else you want, you can buy it — our market 
economy ensures a consumer product diver­
sity to feed all tastes. There’s no reason to get 
involved in government. Those companies 
you buy stuff from pay for it all.
And when you stay home, you’re sending a 
clear message: “I like it this way. Run things 
for me.”
Some worry that such a system might 
encourage a ruler who remains in power for 
too long. Or maybe it’ll give up power to a 
small group of people. What’s wrong with 
that? It’s already happened — there’s a rea­
son most people don’t vote: They like the 
way things are run. Does it matter if the 
country becomes an implicit dictatorship? 
The past few decades have shown that people 
are more and more satisfied with things 
as they are. No need to change anything; 
just let the people in charge do what 
they’re doing.
After all, if things start going badly and 
you don’t like them, you can always choose to 
get involved then.

Columnist casts suspicious eye 
on well-timed campus cleaning
_____________________soh ugppbt
So this past weekend was “Par­
ents’ Weekend.” Of course, with 
Mom and Dad coming down to 
visit, some things around here 
had to change.
For example, dorm rooms had 
to be cleaned. I’m sure that par­
ents didn’t expect our rooms 
to be all that organized, but 
there is good clutter and bad 
clutter. Good clutter would 
be an open Econ book lying 
on the floor surrounded by 
papers and notes from vari­
ous classes. This gives the 
impression that you’ve been 
studying so hard you just 
haven’t had time to clean.
Bad clutter would probably 
include an open box of 
condoms, empty beer cans, 
and a letter from your advi­
sor asking you to explain 
the drunken email you wrote 
to him last night saying you 
want to change your major 
from chemical engineering 
to rhymin’ and stealin’. I’m 
sure many of us had things 
lying around the room that 
parents just shouldn’t see 
altogether. While the tro­
phy empty bottles of tequila and 
Jack Daniels might add to the 
ambience of one’s room on any 
other weekend, chances are they 
might give mom or dad the wrong 
impression. Or, even worse, give 
them the right impression.
While the students did their 
part to get ready for Parents’ 
Weekend, the University was 
making its own preparations. 
There are certain things that you
expect the administration to do in 
order to get ready for the parents. 
They brought out the super- 
friendly admissions people that 
many of us thought might have 
been killed after they had out­
lived their usefulness during Ori­
entation Week. The parents got 
bribed with free travel mugs and 
pins, and there were special dem­
onstrations, and speeches. The 
guest lectures were the most in-
Mohd Zekri Ismail/Tartan Art Staff
triguing part of the schedule that 
I noticed. During Orientation, they 
had also had sample lectures for 
parents. While I never actually 
went to any of these, I’m guessing 
that they aren’t truly representa­
tive of many of the lectures here. 
Chances are that they aren’t go­
ing to bring out a TA who barely 
speaks English to talk incoher­
ently about upper-level calculus 
to parents. And, of course there
was the annual International Fes­
tival, which coincidentally was the 
same weekend as Parents’ Week­
end.
Other things that changed were 
more subtle, so that I’m not sure 
if they were just coincidence or 
planned. For example, the entire 
Hamerschlag building I live in 
suddenly became really clean. 
The bathrooms, which usually 
have hair and other gunk caked 
along the sinks and toilets, 
were virtually spotless. The 
lounge was clean too. Even 
the unidentifiable smell sur­
rounding the trashcans was 
gone. I’m not sure how other 
dorms were, but ours was very 
nice. It wasn’t just dorms that 
were nicer. The Fence usually 
has some kind of decrepit 
wooden shanty next to it, but 
now there was a new-looking 
tent sitting there instead. And 
it was sunny for the first time 
in weeks. Coincidence?
And so our parents will go 
home, secure in the notion 
that we are receiving a qual­
ity education on a beautiful 
campus. As for the students, 
with Halloween coming up 
this weekend, we can go back 
to the usual squalor and chaos 
that most of us are used to. 
We’ll just have to wait until 
the next magical time of year, 
when the campus is clean, excep­
tional food is served in High­
lander, and there’s a general 
cheeriness in the air. But until 
the nejd; sleeping bag weekend 
comes, we’ll just have to make do 
with our ordinary campus.

U.S. support for Kosovo 
demonstrates hypocrisy
lnmb Sahbd
U.S. intervention in the in­
ternal affairs of other nations 
is not a new concept by any 
means. As a nation we have 
prided ourselves on our ability 
to play police chief to the world 
and intervene on behalf of op­
pressed people everywhere — 
or at least that’s what Wash­
ington tells us. However, with 
the recent addition of the tiny 
Yugoslavian region of Kosovo 
to the list of beneficiaries of 
American intervention, it has 
become time to examine our 
role in the world. I agree that
equally to a group of people 
wishing to break the political 
bonds that tie them with Yu­
goslavia. While watching CNN 
one night, I began pondering 
why it was that our State De­
partment has become so in­
volved in the independence 
movement of the little region 
of the Balkans known as 
Kosovo. While our state de­
partment still refuses to ad­
dress the issue of indepen­
dence for the Republic of 
China, or, as it’s more com­
monly known, Taiwan, we are 
fully prepared to give this eth­
nic-based region indepen­
dence.
I first thought that the obvi­
ous answer to this discrepency
“What would lead [officials] to 
believe that supporting indepen­
dence for Kosovo would not di­
rectly contradict supporting de­
pendence for Taiwan?”
at some point during our his­
tory it was, and that it still 
might be, necessary for us to 
flex our political muscle to 
smaller, weaker nations. Call 
it imperialism or call it penis 
envy — whatever term you use 
to describe it still does not 
change the fact that there are 
many nations and many op­
pressed peoples who need our 
help.
But with recent develop­
ments regarding Kosovo and 
Taiwan, U.S. foreign policy is 
once again being applied un-
was based on race and 
ethnicity. Can it be that this 
nation still cannot concern it­
self with the political oppres­
sion of non-white people? Per­
haps that is the answer; over 
in Foggy Bottom our State De­
partment is controlled by a 
bunch of older white males 
incapable of seeing past those 
continents that border the At­
lantic. However, remembering 
that Madeline Albright is our 
Secretary of State and that 
President Clinton has made

Microsoft traps users in monopolistic web
idav Sbatkntk
I Everyone’s favorite billionaire, 
gill Gates, is fighting back against 
the Justice Department once again 
In an attempt to solidify his ad­
vance on Internet technology. Last 
jveek, Netscape and the Justice 
Department reinstated their an­
titrust case against Microsoft. 
Despite what could be considered 
an obvious misuse of a monopoly, 
a D.C. federal court last year 
cleared Microsoft of violating any 
antitrust acts. That was a dark 
day for many computer users, in­
cluding myself, who view 
Microsoft’s advance on Web brows­
ers as an attempt to eliminate our 
good friend, competition. The 
thought of an industry as signifi­
cant as the Internet controlled by 
one company could mean disaster 
for computer users, and even worse 
is the idea that that company could 
be Microsoft.
i We can all agree that 
Microsoft’s operating system (OS) 
has been developed legitimately 
over the years and is the main 
reason that the company has been 
so successful. This monopoly is 
neither illegal nor unethical. It 
simply is this way because the 
people have chosen to buy Win­
dows or have unwittingly been 
landed the decision to buy it by 
the computer manufacturers. The 
complaint the Justice Depart­
ment has is with Microsoft’s use, 
or rather misuse, of that mo­
nopoly. Netscape even alleges 
'that Microsoft had threatened to 
crush Netscape if it didn’t back 
down. Supposedly, there’s a tape 
in which Microsoft is shown try­
ing to divide the Web browser 
industry between itself and 
Netscape. It is illegal to try to 
'gain a monopoly over one indus­
try through the monopoly of an­
other. The trouble comes when
we try to define exactly what the 
industry is.
Microsoft argues that since it 
has packaged, and, in the case of 
Windows 98, integrated Internet 
Explorer (IE) 4.0 into the OS, 
Web browsers no longer consti­
tute a separate industry. That 
argument held up once before.
tion of IE 4.0 is a similar im­
provement, another hi’ ray of sun­
shine from them to us.
But why would the company 
put the time and money into add­
ing IE 4.0 into its OS? It certainly 
isn’t in any real competition for 
operating systems, and it cer­
tainly isn’t for our personal ben-
“The thought of an industry as sig­
nificant as the Internet controlled 
by one company could mean disas­
ter for computer users."
Now it faces further scrutiny by 
the courts. The company’s mo­
tives have now come into ques­
tion. It is true that until now no 
one has complained about the 
addition of those little programs
efit. The obvious reason is that 
Microsoft intends to assume con­
trol over the Web browser indus­
try. Its course of action seems to 
be to first eliminate competing 
browsers by flooding the market
• • • •
like Minesweeper and Paint to 
Windows, and certainly no one 
claims that Microsoft is trying to 
monopolize the gaming and com­
puter graphics industries. 
Microsoft argues that the addi­
Mark Adato/Tartan Contributing Editor 
with IE 4.0.1 can only speculate 
about its next step, but in the end 
it might end.up like this:
“Hey, Joe Blow, did you get the 
new IE 5.000127 yet?”
“No, how much does it cost?”
“Three ninety-five, but they 
fixed a typo on the help file, and 
as you know, you need the newest 
version to access the Internet.”
That may seem like a very over­
blown and dramatic example (be­
cause it is), but it illustrates the 
point that if there is no alterna­
tive, no competition to keep these 
situations from occurring, it will 
be a major step backward for the 
entire computing industry. Com­
petition is what drives compa­
nies to peak performance and, at 
the same time, keeps them in 
check with the consumers. It’s 
simple third-grade economics. 
We need competition in the com­
puter industry.
The only trade-off for us is the 
inconvenience of having to down­
load a Web browser. For me, the 
trade-off took less than two min­
utes. For others, it might take a 
couple of hours. Some are willing 
to do it and others are not. It’s a 
lot like voting — many people 
would like to make the decision, 
but it’s so much easier to not. 
Microsoft is counting on those 
people for its advance on the soft­
ware industry, and who’s to say 
that its advance will end with 
Web browsers? If it is successful 
with its integration argument, 
who’s to say where it will end? 
We could be forced into using 
integrated spreadsheets, and 
word processors “conveniently” 
included in our operating sys­
tem and “price adjusted.” 
Microsoft certainly has the 
means to do it. All it needs is the 
precedent to make it legal. If it 
wins this case, it could eliminate 
all but the most specialized of 
software companies. Think about 
that the next time your default 
browser asks, “Where do you 
want to go today?”

Taiwan deserves equal 
shot at independence
KOSOVO, from page 7
many recent trips to China to 
bask in the glory of Jung 
Xiamen, I don’t quite believe 
myself. No, the real answer is 
that the treatment Taiwan has 
received from this nation 
has been based solely on money 
and greed.
When Nixon went to China, 
he went with historic precedent 
on his side. With Kissinger at 
his side, Nixon was able to nego­
tiate a series of nuclear arms 
treaties that no president be­
fore or after could ever have 
accomplished. Because of the 
SALT I treaty with China, the 
U.S. was able at the very least to 
avoid nuclear proliferation, if 
not total nuclear war. However, 
out of the SALT I treaties came 
a long-standing policy of favor­
ing mainland China’s view of 
Taiwan as a renegade province. 
This policy remains in effect to­
day — last week President 
Clinton commented that he 
hoped that both parties in the 
upcoming China-Taiwan talks 
would be able to work out a 
program for reunification.
While not delving too deeply 
into Taiwanese political history, 
I merely ask if the State Depart­
ment is for real. What in the 
minds of those officials would 
lead them to believe that sup­
porting independence for Kosovo 
would not directly contradict 
supporting dependence for Tai­
wan? Both regions could be de­
scribed as renegade provinces, 
yet we are preparing to recog­
nize yet another European state 
while we still can’t bring our­
selves to grant Taiwan the inde­
pendent status that over one 
hundred other nations enjoy.
Yugoslavia does not offer 
America access to the world’s 
largest domestic economy as
China does. Nor does support­
ing Kosovo’s independence cut 
off our access to the world’s 
largest domestic economy. 
However, as Jiang Xiamen has 
implied recently, supporting 
Taiwanese independence does. 
Clearly, the issue behind the 
differing U.S. treatment of 
Kosovo and Taiwan is money, 
especially for -this current ad­
ministration, which could not 
be more China-friendly if they 
were to hang a picture of 
Mao in the Red Room of the 
White House.
President Clinton clearly 
does not have the leadership 
abilities to negotiate a bargain 
between China and the U.S. 
that would include full diplo­
matic relations between the 
U.S. and Taiwan and the rein­
statement of Taiwan’s seat in 
the United Nations. Our State 
Department is quick to give 
support to a small region of 
Yugoslavia at the risk of anger­
ing a government we don’t par­
ticularly like right now, pro­
vided that that government can 
have little economic impact on 
the U. S. However, our State 
Department is weak when it 
comes to actually supporting a 
large island off the coast of 
China because it would anger a 
government with the power to 
have immense economic impact 
on our nation. Perhaps the next 
time CMU chooses Europe for 
our International Festival, we 
will be hanging the flag of 
Kosovo in Kirr Commons. How­
ever, I sincerely doubt that 
when we choose Asia, we will 
be hanging the Taiwanese 
flag there.

Win comes despite poor offense Volleyball team readies
to host championships
The Steelers’ Comer
by Rich Torio
The first half of the Baltimore Ravens 
game last week was one of the poorest 
exibitions of offensive football Steelers’ 
fans have ever seen. A rattled Kordell 
Stewart beckoned the crowd to stop boo­
ing, but to no avail. Richard Huntley 
continued to have problems hanging on 
to the football, and when he did hang on, 
he barely got any yardage. Kordell 
couldn’t find an open receiver, and when 
he did find one, he missed him by a mile. 
It was ugly. Life without Jerome Bettis 
was not very fun.
But, as bad as our offense was, the 
defense made the Ravens look even 
worse. Eric Zeier, the Ravens quarter­
back, was humiliated, then benched for 
the backup Harbaugh, who in turn was 
embarrassed so badly that Zeier came 
back in to finish the game. At least we 
only have one quarterback to play poorly.
Kordell did end up making a few plays, 
and the Steelers ended up winning 
16-6. The highlight of the game was a 
long ball to Charles Johnson streaking 
¿own the sideline. Yes, we threw the ball 
deep! And even more surprisingly, 
Kordell completed it. And even more 
surprising than that, ‘CJ caught it!
But, even if Kordell isn’t making the 
pass every time, at least offensive coor­
dinator Ray Sherman is giving him the
freedom to try to make the pass. Balti­
more was concentrating on stuffing the 
Pittsburgh running game and forcing 
Kordell to throw the long ball. Sherman 
has to have confidence in Stewart to 
make the play. And, most importantly, 
Kordell has to make it.
Kansas City will most likely take the 
lead from the Ravens and concentrate on
six points and an incompletion. I think 
that’s very important for them to do.” 
Pompeani brings up a good point. For 
a running team, we have not been using 
play-action passing at all. We’ve also 
been seeing a passing game putting up 
more incompletions than anything, so 
maybe a little play-action is just what 
the doctor ordered. Whatever it is,
VOLLEYBALL, from page 14
The only thing on the team’s mind 
right now is the UAA Champion­
ships this weekend. Not only is it the 
Tartans* best chance in a long time
the competition this weekend will be 
fierce. “[The LaRoche Tournament] was 
not very good preparation for the 
UAAs,” said Putaro. Nevertheless, the 
team is confident they can improve on
the run, especially with Bettis returning Kordell has to pick up his game this
to make a big impression in one of their sixth-place finish at the UAA
to the lineup this week. The Chiefs are 
infamous for cheating down their safe­
ties to stuff the run with eight or even 
nine men in the box. Unless Kordell makes 
the big play and forces the defense to play
honest, it’s going to be a long Monday 
night for the Steelers. And if Kansas City 
shuts down Pittsburgh’s attack, the 
Steelers will probably see a lot of eight- 
man fronts from the rest of the teams in 
the league. We have to do something 
different this week to make Kordell feel 
more comfortable.
Bob Pompeani of KDKA news thinks 
that it will be play-action passing. “Play- 
action ... that allows guys [defenders] to 
freeze in their tracks,” said Pompeani. 
“That could be the difference between
week, and in the weeks to come. Jerome 
Bettis, the Steelers’ star running back, 
gave Kordell his vote of confidence.
“I think he showed last week that he 
can definitely get it done [throwing the 
ball downfield],” 
said Bettis. “I think 
he can do it, I think 
we’ll have good suc­
cess, and we’ll win 
the game.”
Well, I don’t 
know if Kordell 
showed anything 
last week, but I 
wasn’t about to ar­
gue with the Bus. 
We’ll see this week 
how Stewart re­
sponds to the 
James Mojonnler/Tartan Art Editor Chiefs’ aggressive
defense. Our offense has to start scor­
ing some points. The defense can’t 
carry us, especially against teams like 
the Chiefs.
Post Game Prognostication (2-0) 
Pittsburgh 27 — Kansas City 21. I 
think my winning streak might come to 
an end this week, but I’m still going 
with the Steelers. Kordell cranks up his 
arm and throws for three touchdowns 
as the Steelers outscore Kansas City in 
a Monday night shootout. What? It is 
possible ... right?

Tournament earlier in the season at 
Washington University in St. Louis. 
They will start off the nine-team tour­
nament pn Friday against Case West­
ern and the University of Chicago.
“We’re going to win the 
first two games,” said 
Webb. “Our goal is to fin­
ish in third place for the 
entire tournament.” 
Putaro is even more 
optimistic. “I think we 
can even get first.” This 
will be quite a task, since 
the tournament favorite, 
Washington University, 
is ranked first in the 
country in Division III.
The keys to the Tar­
tans’ success in the Cham­
pionships lie in the team’s 
youth. “We need [fresh­
men] Sara Lechleitner 
and Anushka Neth- 
isinghe to step it up, par­
ticularly against Case,” 
said Webb.
Like the rest of the 
team, Webb is also en­
thusiastic about the 
team’s chances. “I think 
we are going make the 
UAA stand up and 
say ‘Wow!’ ”
Men’s swim team defeats UAA opponent at Wittenberg dual meet

long time,” said head coach 
David Belowich.
CMU travelled to Wittenberg 
for Saturday’s double-dual 
meet, a meet format which al­
lows three teams to swim 
against each other simulta­
neously. To score the meet, 
swimmer finishes for each pair 
of teams are ranked and given 
point values.
“[Double-dual meets] are good 
because they give a lot of people 
opportunities to swim,” said 
Belowich. Belowich was able to 
enter many of the CMU team 
members as exhibition swim­
mers, which allowed them to com­
pete in events without being 
scored for their finishes.
The meet saw strong perfor­
mances from both the CMU men 
and women, including new pool 
records set by sophomore George

Swim coach David Belowich is enthusiastic for the upcoming season.
Heidinger in the 100-yard but­
terfly (53.44) and by junior Mike 
Robinson in his leg of the 4x100 
men’s freestyle relay (48:36). 
The men scored a top time in 
their exhibition 4x100, finish­
ing with a 3:18.68 and beating 
Washington University by more 
than a second.
“[Heidinger] won by about a 
tenth of a second,” said freshman 
swimmer Ian Peters, who swam
with Heidinger on CMU’s 4x50 
men’s medley relay team, which 
won the event in 1:39.45. “It was 
a really incredible come-from-be- 
hind type of victory.”
With the addition of a group of 
highly talented freshmen to the 
swimming and diving squads, the 
CMU team is poised to have a 
strong season.
“On the men’s side, first, 
breaststroke is strong,” said 
Belowich. “We’re very, very deep. 
We had a strong duo last year 
with Nathan Palm and Jason 
Striner.... This year, they’re 
joined by [Peters], who showed 
some very good things yester­
day. So we have three really good 
breaststrokers. And the addition 
of Brandon May and Erin 
Cambell on diving will help. 
We’re getting some depth in div­
ing, which is something we re­
ally haven’t had before.”
Peters, who easily captured 
first place in the men’s 200- 
yard breaststroke with a 
2:12.59 finish said that so far 
he has been very impressed by 
the quality of competition and 
the level of swimming that he’s 
seen so far as a swimmer at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“I swam U.S. for a few years 
before I got here,” said Peters, 
who has been swimming since he 
was seven years old. “But what 
has really made me happy here 
was the spirit that everyone 
showed when you were swim­
ming.... Everyone was really in­
volved in the meet.”
“On the women’s side, the 
depth isn’t quite as extensive,” 
said Belowich. “But it looks like 
we’ll have a very strong back­
stroke with Jen Skuly, Sara 
Schultzer, Becky Hildebrand, 
and Michelle Kondo. Kondo is a
good IM-er and swam a very good 
backstroke race yesterday.” 
Belowich also said that he exf 
pects the women’s team to d<) 
well in breaststroke and that th$ 
men’s team was very strong i4 
all the freestyle events.
“I think that our sprinting oil 
the men’s side right now isn’t th$ 
greatest,” said Belowich. “But 
that’s mainly because it take$ 
longer to develop the power an4 
speed that you need. We have t<) 
keep working on the things that 
we try to do every day — bettef 
turns and starts—that are mor^ 
technical than they are condif 
tioning-related. And that’ll mak$ 
a big difference in how our time$ 
progress. But everybody is ref 
ally focused and is doing a realty 
nice job.”
The team travels to Grove City

after halftime to score another 
quick touchdown and the game 
was close again. The teams then 
traded touchdowns in the third 
quarter and the score was 
23-21 Tartans.
Junior quarterback Russ Clay, 
who went 11 of 20 in pass at­
tempts on the day, along with 
the rest of the Tartan offense, 
was critical in the win. “Russ 
had his best game of the year,” 
said Lackner. “He made deci­
sions, and [senior Chris Barnicle] 
and all the other guys caught 
some great balls.”
The Tartans did not come out 
of the game cleanly, however. 
^Seniors runningback Mike 
Campie and fullback Ryan 
Kreuger both left late in the third
quarter. “We’re healthy but 
chipped up,” said Lackner. “We’ll 
be finé in January. Now, 
we’re thinking about playing 
next week.”
The Carnegie Mellon defense 
stays true to form from the past 
few games and held strong in the 
second half. They didn’t let the 
Bears take the lead while the 
offense scored a nail-in-the-cof- 
fin touchdown and the final score 
was 30-21.
“This week the whole team 
put it together,” said Lackner. 
“They were enthusiastic the 
whole game.”
“The thing that was most re­
freshing to me was the ability of 
our offense to drive the football 
and keep possession for 40 min­
utes,” he said. “When you have
40 plus snaps per half, you put 
yourself in a position to win.” 
This week, the Tartans return 
home for a Halloween game ver­
sus University Athletic Asso­
ciation rival Rochester. This is 
another must-win game if the 
Tartans are to tie for the confer­
ence championship.
“We have everything riding on 
this game, and I hope the kids 
will rise to the occasion,” said 
Lackner. “After the game, I chal­
lenged them and asked if this 
was a fluke or is this the way we 
want to operate.... If we play 
enthusiastic, disciplined football 
like we did against WashU, we’ll 
do well.”
The Rochester game is on Sat­
urday, October 31 at 7:30 pm in 
Gesling Stadium.

Volleyball ends season with victories
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Editor
Women take first 
at championships
It is the tale of two seasons — 
last year the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s volleyball team was ec­
static about edging out the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh-Bradford 
in rally scoring to win the 
LaRoche Tournament. This year, 
they’re mad they didn’t sweep 
every team. “We should have 
won,” was coach Julie Webb’s 
simple response to this year’s 
second-place finish.
“All these games were com­
petitive last year, and this year 
it was no challenge,” said Webb. 
The Tartans’ only falter on the 
day was versus Carlow College, 
a team that it had beaten earlier 
in the year. “The game was at 
9 am, our bus was late, and we 
weren’t able to warm up prop­
erly,” said Webb. “We’re just not 
a morning team.”
“There were even a few people 
stretching in the workout room a 
few minutes before the game be-
Penn State-Altoona proved to be no match for the Tartans, who played one of their best matches of the year.
gan,” said junior Sarah Putaro.
The Tartans won only one of the 
Carlow games and dropped the 
match 3-1.
The team is not making ex­
cuses, however, especially since

the Tartans face their arch rival 
Case Western Reserve in an 
early. game at this weekend’s 
UAA Championships. “We can­
not do this again versus Case,” 
said Webb.
Overall, the LaRoche Tour­
nament was a testament to the 
team’s improvement, as the 
Tartans set down their other 
competition in convincing style. 
They recovered from the Carlow 
game to defeat Theil, LaRoche, 
and Waynesburg with a com­
bined record of 9—0, mak­
ing their total record for the 
tournament 10-3.
_ In addition to the team suc­
cesses, there were also a number 
of individual standouts. Junior 
Stephanie Szobota was named 
tournament Most Valuable 
Player. “I had the biggest ear-to- 
ear grin on my face when she won 
the MVP,” said Webb. “I’m so 
proud of her. She’s playing out­
standingly, and [she is] really 
working hard on blocking. “
In addition, Putaro was named 
to the All-Tournament Team. 
“Sarah leads us on the court
because she’s smart,” said Webb. 
“She’s the cornerstone of our 
offense.... I think [Putaro and 
Szobota] are really beginning 
to connect.”
The team also played a single 
match last Wednesday at home 
against Penn State-Altoona. 
Again, the Tartans dominated, 
winning 3-0. This time, how­
ever, it was not due to lack 
of competition.
“I don’t think they were a bad 
team,” said Webb. “We just 
played some of our best volley­
ball of the season.”
One of the strongest perfor­
mances on the night came from 
junior Ashley Kinsey. “She is 
fearless, just not afraid of any­
thing,” said Webb. “She’s been 
working really hard, and her 
hitting percentage has dramati­
cally improved.”
The team’s statistics for that 
game illustrate the near-perfect 
performance. They averaged 18 
kills per game and 26.3 digs—by 
far the highest dig count of any * 
game of the season.

The women’s and men’s cross 
country teams flew out to Chi­
cago last weekend for the UAA 
Championships, where they 
met head to head with top run­
ners from such as schools 
Brandeis University and Uni­
versity of Chicago. In the end, 
CMU’s fancy footwork allowed 
the Tartan women to bring 
home first place while the men 
finished second.
“[The season] is going bet­
ter than I expected,” said 
women’s coach Dario

Powers and McGranaghan 
have competed for the top seat 
on the team all season, but ac­
cording to Donatelli, there is no 
visible rivalry between them. 
This weekend, the women 
showed exceptional teamwork 
by running together for almost 
the entire race for the first time 
in their four years on the team. 
Towards the end of the race, 
Powers and McGranaghan con­
tinued to stick together and 
caught up to a rival from 
Brandeis to take their spots in 
the top five. “Maybe after four 
years they are maturing as run­

uted to the consistent success 
of the top senior _runners, 
Margaret Powers and 
Maureen McGranaghan, as 
well as the team’s new tal­
ents, freshmen Brook Cutler 
and Kelly Chin. Powers came

Soccer pulls out of offensive slump
By MATT BRUN
Tartan Staffwriter
The pre-game atmosphere at the 
women’s soccer game last Tuesday was 
a strange blend of excitement and ap­
prehension. The team was eager to be­
gin their non-conference game against 
Grove City College, but they also knew 
that three of the Tartans, goalkeeper 
Lindsay Smith and defensive backs 
Tracy Burton and Kelsi Montgomery, 
would be playing their final game at 
Gesling Stadium.
Compounding the emotion that tradi­
tionally accompanies senior night was 
the team’s need for a solid performance. 
Having lost their last three games by a 
combined score of 5-1, the Tartans des­
perately needed to get themselves back 
on track before hitting the road for three 
straight conference games to end the 
regular season.
Closely following the theory that you 
can’t score if you don’t shoot, CMU 
came out firing, launching the ball to­
ward the goal at every possible oppor­
tunity. The Tartans’ barrage resulted
in 18 shots in the first half alone, 11 of 
which were on goal. Not to be outdone, 
the Tartan defense, led by Burton and 
Montgomery, played a fierce, attacking 
game that allowed exactly zero shots in 
the first half.
With the Tartans clearly dominating 
the game and shooting seemingly at 
will, it was only a matter of time before 
they broke out of their goal-scoring slump 
and put one in the Grove City net. The 
exact time ended up being just six min­
utes into the half when freshmen Marcy

Football wins crucial game
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Editor
“We became a better football team 
last week.” This is the simple answer 
head football coach Rich Lackner gave 
when asked about the team’s marked 
improvement over last week’s home­
coming heartbreaker. The Tartans trav­
eled to Washington University in St. 
Louis for what was perhaps their most 
important game of the season so far. To 
the team’s credit, it was also one of 
their best performances of the year.
Going into the game, the Tartans had 
their work cut out for them. This game 
was a must-win if they were to keep 
hopes alive for a tie for the UAA Confer­
ence Title. It was also against a Wash­
ington team that had a swarming de­
fense and a potent offense,, averaging 
nearly 40 points per game.
“The guys came out very focused, very 
excited for the opportunity to play,” 
said Lackner.
Washington, however, had other
plans for the Tartans and would have 
liked nothing better than to knock 
the pre-season UAA favorites out of 
title contention. The Bears pulled out 
all the stops and, on the opening 
drive of the game connected on a 
reverse pass for a touchdown and the 
Tartans found themselves quickly 
with a 7-0 deficit.
Carnegie Mellon remained focused, 
however, and retaliated with a field 
goal to make the score 7-3. “One of 
the most encouraging things was that 
we were moving the ball consistently,” 
said Lackner. “We were able to get 
over 40 snaps in the first half, which 
was critical. We began to wear their 
defense down too.”
The Tartan defense had yet an­
other strong showing, holding the 
dangerous Bears offense to a single 
score in the first half, and CMU went 
into halftime with a 16-7 lead.
Washington was not about to roll 
over and die though. They came out

Men’s squad beats conference opponent

The CMU men’s soccer team had high 
hopes heading into Friday night’s UAA 
away game against Rochester. Going 
into the game, the Tartans had a 9-4- 
1 record, and were on a three-game win­
ning streak. Their last game was a 3—2 
victory versus Baldwin-Wallace College, 
in which senior Dan Brody tallied his 
first goal of the year and senior Harry 
Ulrich added to his team- and confer­
ence-leading point totals. Sophomore 
Andy Chun scored the other Tartan goal.
“They’re not as good as they were last 
year, but they’re still tough,” said sopho­
more midfielder David Zupon 
before the game. “We defi­
nitely expect a win, though.”
The weekend was a great 
opportunity to improve on the 
team’s UAA record, which now 
stands at 2-2. Beating the 
somewhat hapless Rochester 
(0—4 UAA) and second-place 
Brandeis (3—2 UAA) would 
likely catapult the Tartans 
from fifth in the UAA to sec­
ond, with only one conference 
game left. The team had lost 
its previous two UAA games, 
against New York University 
and Emory, after beating its 
first two conference opponents 
of the season, Washington and 
Case Western.
The Tartans’ expections
and anticipations going into The Tartans will return home to play Washington & Jefferson this Wednesday at 7:30 pm.
the weekend were justified. They edged 
out their conference rivals on a last- 
minute Zupon goal to finalize the score 
at 2-1.
On the field, it was business as 
usual. There were, however, some 
changes in the Tartan strategy. “A 
couple of new guys like [sophomore 
Tom Seier] and [freshman Matt 
Brunner] will probably be seeing some 
time this game,” said sophomore 
midfielder Donny Debarr.
Off the field, however, there is a deeper 
story to last weekend for the men’s soc­
cer team. Once each year, the team takes 
a weekend trip to play two UAA confer­
ence competitors, one on Friday and one
on Sunday. “This is really a great bond­
ing experience for us,” said Zupon. “When 
we’re not playing or getting ready to 
play, we’re just hanging out together or 
playing cards in somebody’s room. That 
or sleeping.”
Of course, because these are two con­
ference games in one weekend, this 
particular weekend has the greatest 
impact on the team’s final standings. 
“These were must-win games for us if 
we want any chance at postseason play,” 
said Zupon.
After last weekend, the Tartans have 
only two games left, and only one UAA 
game, against the University of Chicago 
on October 31.

Rosmus discovered her hometown’s hidden 
Nazi past while writing an essay for a contest.
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Contributing Editor
Imagine doing research for a 
nationwide essay contest and 
uncovering the dark past of 
your own hometown. That’s 
exactly what happened to Anna 
Rosmus, and her life hasn’t 
been the same since.
Rosmus, who now works as a 
writer and lecturer, spoke to 
group of approximately 30 stu­
dents, faculty, and parents last 
Saturday evening in the 
Connan Room as part of the 
International Festival. The 
Activities Board Political
Speakers committee sponsored 
her lecture.
“We were looking for someone 
who could address current polit­
ical issues in Europe; we consid­
ered topics such as the IRA, war 
victims in the former Czech 
Republic, or the effects of democ­
racy in the former Soviet bloc,” 
said Melissa Chan, a senior 
chemical engineering major and 
a member of the committee. 
“After some looking, we found 
Rosmus, who addressed an 
important issue: the anti-neo- 
Nazi movement in Germany, a 
current issue that has received 
quite a bit of publicity since the 
fall of the Berlin Wall.”
Rosmus began by detailing 
how she, as, a Roman Catholic, 
came to be interested in the his­
tory of Jewish people in her 
hometown and eventually
became an activist 
for their remem­
brance. In 1980, a 
newly wed Rosmus 
was a freshman at 
the university in 
Passau, Germany, 
when the president 
of the country 
announced an essay 
competition about 
everyday life in 
the Third Reich.
While doing her 
research, Rosmus 
learned of Passau’s 
Nazi past and since 
has written books, 
given lectures, and 
even had a movie 
made about her life.
According to 
Rosmus, nobody in 
Passau told their 
children about the 
concentration camps or other 
Nazi initiatives that they saw 
before and during World War
II. Even the schools avoided 
the subject.
“I went through high school 
and I graduated in history with 
an A,” said Rosmus. “While I 
knew everything about ancient 
Greece, I never heard anything 
about World War II. The war 
was categorically avoided.”
Since then, Rosmus has 
uncovered much about the cru­
elty that took place in Passau
— secrets that many of the citi­
zens wanted to remain hidden.
She spoke about children who 
were fed spoiled milk so they 
would die and starving concen­
tration camp workers who 
would march through the 
streets of the city. Through her 
research she discovered there 
are mass graves in her home- i 
town that have since been cov- ! 
ered with parking lots or corn­
fields with no commemorative 
plaque or action.
Uncovering these secrets led 
to a number of problems for 
Rosmus. She found that docu­
ments had been deliberately fal-

Plane tickets to Europe run at least a 
few hundred dollars a piece. But last 
weekend, lucky students, parents, and 
other members of the CMU community 
got to enjoy the best the continent has 
to offer without paying a cent. CMU’s 
eighth annual International Festival, 
which brightened campus from last 
Thursday through Sunday, celebrated 
the culture and society of Europe.
CMU has been holding International 
Festivals every year since 1991, focus­
ing on one of four different continents 
each year. This year was Europe’s turn. 
“The festival’s purpose is to showcase 
student talent to parents and communi­
ty and to educate people about interna­
tional issues, and it’s a fun activity for 
students,” said Heather Midkiff, coordi­
nator of Student Activities and chief 
organizer of the event.
Since 1994, the International 
Festival has also coincided with 
Family Weekend, allowing visiting rel­
atives as well as regular members of 
the CMU community to enjoy the fes­
tivities. “The festival is fun in that it’s 
something the whole family can go to,” 
said Midkiff.
Food was a hot topic at the festival. 
Many were excited that they could 
obtain free International Festival cook­
books with recipes for European treats 
such as veal paprika and chocolate fon­
due. But others complained about the 
food at the festival itself.
“The way they advertised it was as if 
there were going to be a lot of vendors,” 
said computer science post-doctoral stu­
dent Suresh Bhavnani. “[But] there 
was only Papa J’s and some other stuff 
that didn’t capture the variety of 
European cuisines. We came here hun­
gry, expecting a big lunch — we ended 
up having french fries.”
While the food may not have met 
Bhavnani’s expectations, other aspects 
of the festival left him satisfied. “The 
flamenco performers were unbelievable. 
There were two performances, and I 
stayed back to watch it again,” he said.
The dance performances, which fea­
tured Spanish, Irish, and Ukranian 
troupes, were popular with many festi­
val attendees. “It was difficult, especial-
ly since it was all girls and me,” said 
first-year electrical and computer engi­
neering major Nasser Siddique about a 
Saturday afternoon flamenco workshop 
he had- attended. “But by the end, I 
really got the hang of it and liked it.”
Other memorable festival events 
included two keynote addresses that 
focused on modern European issues. 
Josef Joffe, an editor at a promiment 
German newspaper, drew on his jour­
nalistic experience to speak about 
“Europe on the Eve of the 21st 
Century.” Wouter Wilton focused on 
“Current Developments in the 
European Union,” detailing the motiva­
tions behind various countries’ deci­
sions to join or not to join the Union. 
Joffe’s Thursday speech attracted a 
crowd of 100 people, and Wilton’s 
address on Friday drew about 50.
This festival boasted higher atten­
dance than the previous one, held last 
October. “It’s been really exciting to see 
so many students participating in the 
International Festival this year,” said 
Midkiff. According to her numbers, 1,000 
people participated in the events held on

While everyone at CMU has a 
different personal journey, the 
settings of the current chapter 
in these journeys involve the 
same campus community. The 
previous chapters of these trav­
els in life make each person 
unique. The Personal Journey 
series at this past weekend’s 
1998 International Festival 
gave an opportunity for people 
to share some of these interest­
ing journeys.
This year, there were six ses­
sions, all held in the Dowd 
Room in the University Center. 
Heather Midkiff, coordinator of 
this year’s festival, described 
this room as an appropriate set­
ting for this series.
‘The Personal Journeys pro­
vide an opportunity for the fac­
ulty, staff, and students to share 
their experiences in Europe in a 
smaller setting,” said Midkiff.
In some of the presentations, 
the imagery and knowledge 
obtained in Europe were related 
to the CMU audience. Other lec­
tures recalled the events that 
took place when people from the 
CMU community used their tal­
ents in Europe.
The Personal Journey series 
began with a lecture called “An 
Entire School’s Adaptation of 
the Reggio Emilia Approach to 
Early Education.” The presen­
ters, Marsha Poster and Judy
Abrams from the
Cyert Center for
Early Education, 
spoke about their trip 
to study the schools in 
Reggio Emilia, Italy 
and how they adopted 
those internationally 
renowned techniques 
for the early educa­
tion program at
CMU. While other 
preschools in the
United States have
adapted these ideas,
CMU is the first to 
build a new facility 
based on it.
History professor 
Daniel Resnick also 
wanted to present the 
images he took in 
while visiting Paris.
His talk, “The 
Parisian Student

Students display artifacts from overseas
By CYNTHIA KOS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
“I can’t imagine the experiences you 
get out of doing something like this,” 
Brendan Pester, a sophomore economics 
major, said as he peered at a panoramic 
view of a crowded city’s landscape. “I 
definitely want to do this someday.”
The 1998 Study Abroad Art Show 
was held last Friday in the University 
Center Art Gallery. Students who spent 
anywhere from a half-semester to a 
whole year studying abroad displayed 
photos and sketches, receipts and tick­
et stubs, gum wrappers and 
McDonald’s menus gathered from their 
experiences. The participants, as well 
as interested students such as Pester, 
gathered to discuss all there is to gain 
by studying beyond the borders of the 
United States.
(iYou can go almost anywhere,” said 
Adriana Garcia, a senior art major, 
while glancing at photos captured by 
senior architecture major Amy 
Poettinger of Valencia’s “Las Fallas” fes­
tival. “I wanted to go to Spain, but [the 
School of Art] didn’t have a program to 
Valencia. If you want to go somewhere 
that badly, you can find a way.”
Garcia met Poettinger at the 
Universidad Polytechnica where she 
studied the second semester of her 
junior year. “[Poettinger] got there 
completely on her own, making her 
own phone calls and arrangements, 
all because she wanted to study 
architecture in Valencia,” she said.
Garcia and another student par­
ticipated in the first exchange pro­
gram the School of Art established 
with Valencia, Spain. On a train ride 
she took in Italy, Garcia met people 
who knew one of her friends from 
Texas. “It really opened my mind as 
to how small the world really is,” she 
said. “The things you actually read 
and study from textbooks, you actu­
ally see and experience. It’s incredi­
ble, and something I would definite­
ly do again.”
“I thought it would be a unbeliev­
able experience, and it certainly 
was,” said Holly Gabrielson, a senior 
drama major who studied production 
at the Moscow Art Theatre School.

Artifacts on display ranged from Russian

one for the McDonald’s breakfast menu. 
‘They had just got [the breakfast menu] 
to be offered there, and they made a big 
deal about it,” she said.
Students interested in studying 
abroad are welcome to contact Eva 
Mergner, the Study Abroad Advisor 
from the Office of International 
Education. “We have students from all 
disciplines go all around the world,” 
she said.
Mergner feels it is best for interested 
students to explore all of their options 
with the University Exchange and 
Study Abroad programs. This year 
about 200 students studied abroad, 
some for a semester, and others for the 
summer, in countries such as 
Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and France.
“Studying abroad is one of the great­
est things students can do for them­
selves,” Mergner said. “It really widens 
their perspective, and they each come

Computer science, psychology, busi­
ness administration, economics, and 
philosophy. For Herbert Simon, it all 
boils down to human decision-making 
and problem-solving processes.
Simon began his academic career as 
an undergraduate in political science in 
1933. Now, 65 years later, he is the 
Richard King Mellon University 
Professor of Computer Science and 
Psychology at Carnegie Mellon and one 
of the best-known minds in artificial 
intelligence in the world, having 
worked on such projects as the General 
Problem Solver computer program, 
which attempted to solve problems 
much in the way the human mind does. 
The Tartan caught up with him last 
Saturday after he gave a Last Lecture 
Series talk on teaching at a research 
institution, to find out how he helped to 
shape the development of artificial 
intelligence (AI) from its roots to its pre­
sent-day form.
The Tartan: Why did you decide to 
come to Carnegie Tech?
Herbert Simon: The school had just 
got an endowment from William 
Larimer Mellon for GSIA. I saw that it 
would let me work with graduate stu­
dents in a way I couldn’t before. The 
Illinois Institute of Technology, where I

Prize in Economic Sciences.
had been, didn’t have the resources to 
support research in organizations and 
behavior, so I went where the resources 
were. They also had the exciting idea of 
building a new sort of business school.
TT: What was this idea?
HS: It was that business schools 
should have much more grounding in 
relevant sciences such as psychology. 
Just at that time, new mathematical 
tools of operations research came in,
and we thought it would be a good idea 
to see how those could be applied to 
business. Until that time, business 
schools had been almost all how-to-do- 
it stuff — there was no theory behind 
the method. We thought this wasn’t the 
best way to do it.
While I was here, I did some consult­
ing with Rand Corporation, a think 
tank on the West Coast. It was then 
that I came into my first real contact 
with computers. I realized that the 
kinds of research we were trying to do 
in business could be modeled on com­
puters. This was the origin of our work 
on artificial intelligence.
We found Allen Newell and brought 
him back to finish his PhD in business 
administration and began research on 
a computer program that could find 
proofs in logic. We weren’t necessarily 
interested in the logic problems them- 
slves; we just chose it as an example of 
human thinking. We thought that if the 
computer could find these proofs, then 
it was thinking.
Since at first we didn’t have a com­
puter, we did our research out at Rand 
— a man named Cliff Shaw was our 
contact there. He was sitting out there, 
and we were in Pittsburgh, and we 
communicated by telephone and tele­
type. It was a little odd, but Rand put 
up the $400 a month phone bill to do 
the research. In about a year, we per­
suaded those in charge that the Tech
campus needed a computer, so they 
bought an IBM 650 and installed it in 
the basement of GSIA.
We were successful with our first pro­
gram; the logic theorist demonstrated 
in principle that computers could do 
non-numerical, symbolic tasks. So we 
launched a long-term project looking at 
whether computers could do the same 
type of problem solving as humans.
TT: Did you know at the time how big 
AI would become?
HS: We kind of did, although we had 
no notion of the shape it would take. It 
seemed to us it would be a new big 
thing. Newell and I wrote a talk in 
1957 in which we made a few predic­
tions about computers. We weren’t 
embarrassed to predict that sooner or 
later computers could do the same type 
of thinking humans do. It came out 
pretty accurately, though it took 40 
years for a computer to beat a human 
chess champion when we predicted 10.
TT: What kinds of things do you do in 
your spare time?
HS: Well, I don’t have much, but I 
play the piano some — Mozart, Bach, 
Beethoven, Hayden, as long as it does­
n’t go too fast. I never get around to 
memorizing it, though, so I still have to 
sight read.
My main recreation is my work. 
There are not many things I enjoy more 
than satisfying my curiosity about how 
things work in the world.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 26 October 1998L3
Students flock to lecture in search of good grades
By SETH MANDEL
Tartan Personnel Manager
The proposition of receiving 
either a 4.0 GPA or a hundred 
dollars was an offer that many 
CMU students couldn’t refuse. 
Last Wednesday night, a stand­
ing room only crowd packed 
McConomy Auditorium to hear 
Donna O. Johnson present her 
“Guaranteed 4.0 Seminar,” spon­
sored by the National Society for 
Black Engineers (NSBE).
The majority of students inter­
viewed before the event believed 
that the $100 guarantee that 
Johnson’s program could help 
them get a 4.0 GPA was more of 
a publicity stunt than a serious 
offer. “I feel that they’re not 
actually going to pay $100, but 
I’m here to get some study tips,” 
said David Jou, a first-year 
undeclared student in CIT.
“I hope I will learn good study 
skills that I can apply, not just 
fluff like ‘work hard.’ The money 
got my interest, but I wouldn’t 
fail for $100,” said Rande Shern, 
a junior math major.
Not all students felt that the 
seminar was a good idea,, howev­
er. Donovan Chase, a junior cre­
ative writing and political sci­
ence double major, said, “I think 
this sort of lecture is indicative 
of CMU’s obsession with statisti­
cal success and incites an over- 
competitive environment.”
Johnson, who graduated from 
the University of Texas-Austin in 
1987, began the lecture by 
addressing the issue that was on 
many students’ minds. She said 
that her lecture was designed for 
those students who want to 
receive a 4.0, not a hundred dol­
lars. In fact, she basically said 
that it was unlikely that a stu­
dent would actually receive any 
money. However, she did add 
that she puts the guarantee on 
the program to show people that 
she really believes in it.
Erica Yamada/Tartan Darkroom Staff 
Enthusiastic attendees, lured by the prospect of a guaranteed 4.0, 
pepper lecturer Donna Johnson with questions about her techniques.
The motivational lecture con­
sisted of an introduction about 
stress and time management, 
followed by a three-step plan 
that Johnson claims can ensure 
a 4.0 GPA. Her three main 
guidelines for success were: go 
to class, see each of your profes­
sors once a week, and do what 
you’re supposed to do when 
you’re supposed to do it. For 
each of these steps, Johnson 
gave detailed explanations of 
why these practices are impor­
tant and how students can go 
about accomplishing them.
Johnson said that she believes 
her lecture is particularly signif­
icant at a school like CMU. “I 
like to speak to high-stress 
schools to teach students that 
they can actually relax, have 
fun, and enjoy their college 
experience without being 
stressed out. It takes less time 
to do my program and make all 
A’s than to procrastinate, waste 
time, and make all C’s.”
When asked about the $100 
guarantee, Johnson said that 
she actually would give $100 to
any student who followed her 
program exactly and did not see 
an improvement. She explained 
that although there have been 
some students who have 
approached her ¦ about the 
money in the past, these stu­
dents have either eventually 
admitted that they did not fol­
low the plan or told her that 
their grades have increased sig­
nificantly, but not quite to a 4.0. 
Johnson cited many success sto­
ries from her program and said, 
“I encourage students to do the 
plan and prove me right.”
Student reaction to the pro­
gram was mixed, ranging from 
the feeling that her ideas were 
beneficial to the belief that the 
program was unrealistic. “It 
would be effective, but it seems 
like you would have to have no 
life and too much motivation,” 
said Dave Trost, a first-year 
electrical and computer engi­
neering major.
Johnson’s program was judged 
critically by academic advisors, 
professors, and organizers of 
similar academic programs on
campus. “I believe that the pro­
gram offered no new insights on 
how to succeed academically. It 
reinforced the principle that 
learning is not a passive activity, 
but an active one,” said Eric 
Grotzinger, associate dean and 
first-year-advisor in MCS. “If 
students are to meet their acad­
emic goals, then they need to 
take responsibility and be active 
in the learning.”
“Those steps are surely a good 
recipe for improving academic 
performance, on average,” said 
Helmut Vogel, professor of 
physics. “But to extrapolate 
from such a correct statistical 
statement to a 100 percent guar­
antee for each individual is 
unscientific and ridiculous. 
Even when Shamu splashes at 
SeaWorld there is no guarantee 
that every single spectator in a 
front row will get wet.”
Linda Hooper, coordinator of 
Academic Development,
explained that the suggestions 
Johnson gave are actually very 
similar to some of what 
Academic Development does at 
their free weekly study skills 
workshops. According to her, 
although Johnson’s suggestions 
were generally correct, the plan 
makes several incorrect assump­
tions and oversimplifies things.
“The people who benefit 
the most from these programs 
are people who stick with 
the suggestions,” said Charles 
Cunningham, supervisor of aca­
demic counselors for Academic 
Development. “People who look 
for magic don’t do as well as 
those who want to change their 
behavior.”
Leon Hsu, a post-doctoral stu­
dent in the Center for Innovation 
in Learning and consultant to 
Academic Development, said, 
“Her ideas were good, but the 
way they were presented, in a big 
lecture, didn’t help nearly as 
much as if a student came to
Academic Development for one- 
on-one counseling.”
Indira Nair, vice provost for 
Education, echoed many of these 
comments and added that the 
main difference between many 
of the programs that were 
offered on campus in the past 
and Johnson’s is how they were 
promoted. Nair criticized the 
program for marketing the out­
come as receiving a 4.0 instead 
of learning. “Maybe we ought to 
‘market’ and package these good 
habits as well as Donna Johnson 
does,” she said.
The organizers of the event 
seemed satisfied with how the 
program went. “I was really 
happy about the turnout. The 
whole room was packed,” said 
Paul Butts, a junior chemical 
engineering major and presi­
dent of NSBE.
Anthony Watkins, a junior 
computer science and ECE dou­
ble major and telecommunica­
tions chair of NSBE, attributed 
much of the success of the pro­
gram to the way the deans of 
the colleges and the adminis­
tration helped NSBE get the 
word out.
Though the effectiveness . of 
the program may not be seen 
until the end of the semester, 
administrators and faculty, how­
ever, seemed to agree that the 
goal of such programs should be 
to help students change their 
behavior to achieve goals that 
are specific to themselves.
“Even if students try half of 
the suggestions they are given* 
they will benefit,” said Hooper. 
“The most important thing is for 
students to use what they find 
to be helpful.”

Weekend brings families together
By KATIE MARTINEZ
Tartan Staffwriter
; Just when you thought you were safe 
apd nobody could tell you to pick those 
dirty socks up off the floor, Family 
Weekend arrived. Flocks of parents and 
siblings arrived last Friday afternoon 
and Saturday morning bearing gifts 
and giving hugs, prepared to spend a 
whole weekend of quality time with 
their college student. Different families 
spent it in different ways, and student 
reactions to the parental invasion var­
ied, although, overall, the parents were 
very well-received on campus.
•The point of Family Weekend was 
unclear for some students. While some 
saw the school-sponsored weekend as 
a- positive event for both students and 
their families, others saw it as a 
school-sponsored excuse for parents to 
come nag their kids.
! “[Family] Weekend gave my parents 
ah excuse to come and see me, and I 
didn’t really want my parents to come, 
but I guess I have no choice. Hopefully 
I ! won’t kill them,” said Bettina Elstro, 
a; first-year electrical and computer 
engineering major.
Although the school sponsored some 
events for parents, like campus tours 
and socials, most parents decided to 
spend time solely with their kids. “My 
parents and I are going out to dinner 
and buying groceries and hanging 
out,” said Mercer Bufter, a sophomore 
English major. “They’re not going to 
see the panels or anything because 
they already saw all of it the first time 
they visited the school.”
For many families, the weekend itin­
erary was based on what the student 
wanted to do, which was, in a lot of 
cases, shop and eat. Yoko Elstro said, 
“We just did whatever Bettina wanted 
to do, like go shopping, because that’s 
what’s most important.”
Some students felt that shopping 
shouldn’t be the main objective of 
Family Weekend. “The primary vision 
of Parents Weekend is to hang out 
with your folks, not to scam cash off of 
them,” said Bufter.
As popular as shop­
ping and eating were 
for Family Weekend 
activities, some fami­
lies did much more 
than that in their rela­
tively short weekend 
here on campus. Janet 
Suarez, mother of 
Maria Suarez, a first- 
year student in MCS, 
said, “We looked 
around at the campus 
and went over to the 
park and the conserva­
tory. Tonight we’re 
planning on going to 
the Philharmonic, and 
tomorrow we’ll play it 
by ear.”
This weekend was 
not an ideal weekend 
for all families to come, 
though, and there were 
many students who did 
not receive visits from 
their parents. In some 
instances, students 
whose parents weren’t 
able to come to visit 
this weekend were 
taken on as surrogate 
children by friends’ 
parents. Jake Feige, a 
first-year design major whose parents 
couldn’t come, was taken out to dinner 
by his girlfriend’s parents. “Going out to 
dinner with my girlfriend’s parents was 
a really nice break from campus food, 
and it was really great to meet them,” 
he said. “It made me feel better because 
my parents weren’t able to be here.” 
Some parents used this weekend for 
other purposes than just spending time 
with their son or daughter. Some par­
ents attended lectures; others went 
and visited the fraternities or sororities 
that they had belonged to in college. “I 
was a Kappa Sigma at Indiana, and I 
went over to introduce myself to the 
brothers here. It really added some­
thing to my Family Weekend experi­
ence,” said Jerry Elstro, father of 
Bettina Elstro.
Anthony Chao/Tartan Photo Editor 
Students and their families gathered for brunch on the 
last day of Family Weekend last Sunday.
The school sponsored a variety of 
events which parents, such as robotics 
lectures to discussions of teaching 
methods. These events were well-liked 
by many parents. Jerry Stolt, father of 
first-year CIT student Benjamin Stolt, 
said, “I think that this idea of not just 
inviting the parents but offering so 
many opportunities to learn about how 
things work here was great.”
From shopping to going to panel dis­
cussions, families found many ways to 
fill the weekend. Generally, Family 
Weekend proved to be an enjoyable 
experience for both students and par­
ents. Leena Akhtar, a first-year unde­
clared student in H&SS, said, “I think 
Parents Weekend was pretty positive. 
It allowed parents to see where all 
their money was going.”
Speaker finds hidden 
history in hometown
LECTURE, from page LI
sified. When she tried to gain access to 
documents that indicted community 
members, she was stopped and had to 
file a lawsuit for access that she even­
tually won. Rosmus explained that she 
and her family were deeply affected by 
her work and that she was even physi­
cally threatened.
“Occasionally, I had the impression 
the whole town had conspired against 
me,” said Rosmus. “I asked myself, is it 
possible to love a country whose inhab­
itants quite simply don’t want to come 
to terms with their past? Is it possible 
for me to feel safe when night after 
night my telephone rings with hateful 
calls because I wrote a book about the 
Jewish people in my town?”
While Rosmus was researching the 
town, she also came across some sur­
prising information about her own 
grandmother. She told how she uncov­
ered documents that detailed her 
grandmother’s involvement in a 
protest against the government and 
how she learned her grandmother had 
hidden a priest who was being chased 
by the Gestapo. Though her grand­
mother was threatened by the Gestapo 
and was almost sent to Dachau, she 
persisted in her protests, which includ­
ed walking an hour to a concentration 
camp on the edge of town each evening 
to throw food scraps over the fence to 
the starving prisoners.
Rosmus also took time to outline the 
history of Passau, which is located on 
the Austrian border, to show how it 
came to be a center for the Nazi move­
ment. According to Rosmus, Passau’s 
anti-Jewish sentiment dates back a 
thousand years when the Jews were 
first mentioned in the town’s historical 
documents. At this time Jews were 
made to pay a toll when entering the 
town. Five hundred years later, the last 
synagogue was destroyed and the 
remaining Jews were killed. A law was 
passed that said Jews should never be 
allowed to enter the town again. Then
in 1840, Passau became part of 
Bavaria and Jews were given rights 
again. At the turn of the century, Jews 
were able to return to Passau.
More recently, Passau was home to a 
young Adolf Hitler and others who 
would hold high positions within the 
Nazi government. According to 
Rosmus, after World War I, new anti- 
Jewish attitudes arose in the town. In 
1920 the Nazi party was organized, 
and soon after, Passau held Germany’s 
first official anti-Jewish boycott. By 
1933, only 40 Jews were in Passau, and 
in 1935, the town was declared free of 
Jews. Even after World War II, 
extreme right meetings have continued 
to be held in Passau where the swasti­
ka is still displayed.
Rosmus raised Passau’s history to 
international prominence when one of 
her books was turned into a movie. The 
German film called The Nasty Girl, 
which was nominated for a Foreign 
Film Academy Award in 1990, chroni­
cles the early part of Rosmus’s life 
when she was just beginning to uncov­
er her hometown’s Nazi past.
She now lives in Washington, D.C., 
but continues to locate and publish sto­
ries about the Jewish people who lived 
and sometimes died in Passau. She is 
also working to combat the neo-Nazi 
movement and extreme right in 
Germany and to convince others to join 
in her fight.
Students came to listen to the lectur­
er for a variety of reasons. “I’m Jewish, 
and I wanted to hear the German side 
of things,” said Michael Averbuch, a 
junior physics major. “I had never 
heard of Passau, so I learned a lot 
more about it. There were some right­
eous people even in the hometown of 
Adolf Hitler.”
After the lecture, Rosmus spent an 
hour answering questions from the 
audience ranging from how accurately 
the film depicted her life to current 
events like the possible construction of 
a Holocaust memorial in Berlin.

Fair samples European culture
FESTIVAL, from page LI
Thursday and Friday alone. Just 
one of these events, a show fea­
turing British Invasion, a band 
specializing in covers of British 
rock favorites, attracted 400 
attendees, according to Midkiff.
Midkiff offered an explanation 
for the festival’s success in 
terms of attendance. “The com­
mittee really focused on publici­
ty this year,” she said. Among 
the initiatives it took were send­
ing postcards to faculty and per­
sonal invitations to selected 
members of the University com­
munity, as well as putting ban­
ners up on campus. Posters had 
gone up around campus weeks 
before the event, and banners 
and European flags in the UC 
drew attention to the festivities. 
Yet some students disagreed as 
to the quality and extent of 
Festival publicity.
“I haven’t been to any activi­
ties, and I didn’t know they were 
going on,” said junior logic & 
computation major Laurel 
Margulis. “The only reason I 
knew there was an International 
Festival was because I saw the 
[countries’] flags up.”
Other students who had 
attended and enjoyed the 
Festival echoed Margulis’ com­
ments about student awareness. 
“I think the actual content was 
pretty incredible, but I think 
they should publicize a lot more, 
especially individual events,” 
said first-year H&SS student 
Kalee Whitehouse.
“[This year’s festival] has been 
a lot more visible, although I 
guess they all sort of lack in vis­
ibility,” said junior communica­
tion design and history & 
anthropology major Margot 
Bloomstein. “In terms of adver-
tising for these things, it’s not 
just about posters and having a 
cool little logo. It’s also about 
designing an atmosphere.”
Heidi Koler, a first-year politi­
cal science major and assistant 
to Midkiff, works closely with 
her to help plan the Festival. 
But her responsibilities didn’t 
stop her from enjoying her first 
opportunity to experience the 
Festival. “It surpassed all of my 
expectations,” she said.
“As long as everyone had a 
good time, I’m happy,” said 
Anika Amin, a junior social and 
decision sciences major. A mem­
ber of the committee which 
planned the festival, Amin 
organized the Festival Cup ten­
nis tournament which took 
place last Saturday and 
Sunday. “And it seems like 
everyone did [have fun]. So it 
was worth the time.”

culture, along with economics, 
Spanish history, and art history 
at the University of Grenada.
“A lot of students never get a 
chance to study abroad. But the 
ones that do should look into 
Spain because it’s such a won­
derful country,” said Watkins.
leva Allison’s talk, called ‘The 
Baltic States: Past and Present,” 
was a presentation about her 
journey leading up to Pittsburgh. 
Allison came to the United 
States from Latvia in 1992.
Her lecture was more informal 
so she could relate life in Latvia 
before and after the country 
gained independence from the 
Soviet Union in 1992. Latvia is 
an important area for some stu­
dents because it is the destina­
tion for next summer’s 
Alternative International Break 
Experience.
As for last summer’s break 
experience, the students who 
participated in it were able to 
present the journey they made 
to Dresden, Germany. It was 
the first year this program had
been held in the summer. The 
team consisted of 13 students 
and two advisors who spent 
three weeks clearing an area on 
a farm so a social center for 
youth could be set up. The pre­
sentation, which was entitled 
“Alternative International 
Break Experience,” described 
what the students gained from 
their journey.
“Basically, we started as a 
group of individuals, and we 
ended as a group of people,” 
said Tzuan-Ta Wang, a sopho­
more business administration 
major. “It was a learning experi­
ence for all of us. It’s one of 
those bonding experiences 
where you have a lot of time to 
talk.... It wasn’t like the way at 
school where there’s not much 
time to talk.”
Another example of students 
spending their time to work in 
Europe was presented in “The 
Frankfurt Mural: Learning
German and Working with the 
Elderly.” It was given by archi­
tecture professor Doug Cooper 
and the student interns who
helped him produce a mural in 
a market in Frankfurt, 
Germany. They worked with 
elderly citizens to construct 
this mural.
The people who attended the 
Personal Journey series were 
looking for something different 
than hearing profiles, history, 
and statistics about the differ­
ent European countries. The 
audience reaction seemed to 
indicate that the series of pre­
sentations lived up to its goal of 
offering those who attended the 
Festival an alternative to tradi­
tional lectures.
“It was interesting to go 
and hear someone’s integration 
of history with personal reflec­
tion,” said Sally Mattern, a 
sophomore BHA major.
“I think [the Personal Journey 
series] is valuable because peo­
ple get to share their experi­
ences in Europe,” said April

epiphanyepiphany
Epiphany is the hot company to check out this year.
Our third founder was sailing around the world with his 
wife somewhere around French Polynesia when he got 
the call asking him to join the company.
He turned around and sailed back.
Epiphany is a fast-growing
start-up; the leader in the 
new category of enter­
prise relationship 
management soft 
ware. We're look­
ing for people to 
do software prod­
uct design and de­
velopment, and 
we hire only the 
best.
There are a lot of 
hard CS prob­
lems we have 
to solve, in­
volving data­
bases, Al, algo­
rithms, and 
web-based GUI's.
You’ll work with re­
cent CMU, Stanford,
Harvard, and Cornell 
grads, former profes­
sors, lecturers, MBAs, and 
valedictorians (two of 'em).
You’ll work with smart, fun, good 
solid folk, and you’ll have a chance 
to have a big impact in building a - 
no, the — start-up company.
If you can deal with constant bickering 
about the protocol of calling "shotgun 
(from time to time, life here is like living in a 
Seinfeld episode), a refrigerator stocked with Odwalla 
and Snapple, late night trips to the movies and late night 
programming, you'll have a good time here.
It's a lot of fun, but it's also serious business, and we 
have an amazing management team. Our CEO was
previously deputy chairman and COO of KPMG Peat 
Marwick, LLP, a member firm of a $9 billion, 85,000 per­
son organization . Our VP of Engineering is a former 
Harvard CS professor and was a venture capitalist for 
several years before founding Epiphany. Our VP of Mar­
keting has been on the cover of Wired (before it 
became "tired"), is a master at market­
ing, and has been doing valley 
startups for nearly 20 years. Our 
VP of Sales was previously a 
successful Sales VP at 
Netscape, and we already 
have significant revenues 
from our customers. But 
don’t take our word for it, 
you can see for yourself 
why "Red Herring" 
magazine (Sept. 1998) 
chose us as one of the 
top 50 private compa­
nies of the year!
With a team like this, 
you might expect 
that we're well- 
funded, and you'd be 
right. We've raised 
over $2oM of invest­
ment funding in just 
the past year. We of­
fer exceptional compen­
sation, with significant 
equity opportunities. We 
also provide an unparal­
leled opportunity to learn 
about the elements of a well- 
run start-up!

Puzzle of the day: A person is sitting in a boat 
on a lake. There is a metal anchor in the boat. The 
person throws the anchor overboard into the lake. Does 
the level of the water in the lake rise, fall, or stay the 
same? For all yinz who’ve heard that one before: What 
does the boat do?

DIVERSIONS
Volume 93, Issue 8The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania26 October 1998
Dancers perform traditional pieces
;By LARITA Y. HAMILTON
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
There was a definite festival atmo­
sphere in the air last Saturday as the 
entertainment for the International Fes­
tival took over in Rangos Ballroom. 
Food and craft vendors sold their goods, 
while the stage came to life with dancers 
and musicians.
An accordian player entertained the 
audience while the dancers prepared, 
and was well recepted. Finally, after a 
30-minute delay, the dancers took over.
First up was the Kyiv Ukranian 
Dance Company. The 60-year-old troop 
is comprised of 20 members and a 
school of 35 children, ages ranging 
'from three to 13.
Wearing traditional dress, the pro­
gram began with the £CWelcome Dance,” 
in which the dancers symbolically pre­
sented the audience with bread. The 
bright, eye-catching costumes lent to 
the general festivity in the air. After 
the “Welcome Dance,” the group per­
formed three other numbers. A spokes­
person for the group explained that 
the purpose of Ukranian dance is to 
tell a story. “Dolls,” for instance, told 
the story of a young couple whose love 
•is tested by an evil landlord.
The Burke Irish Dancers took the stage 
after the Kyiv Ukranian company. The 
performers were children of all ages and 
, skill levels, and they won the audience
over from the start. Both hard and soft 
shoe dances were performed. Five tradi­
tional dances and one original dance 
made up the performance.
The students wore traditional cos­
tumes embroidered with distinctive 
Celtic designs. The younger girls’ cos­
tumes were school uniforms, which were 
green with an orange and yellow design,
kids are getting involved in this type 
of art form,” commented Mondeep 
Puri, a senior electrical and computer 
engineering maj or. “It shows that they 
are trying to retain their culture, some­
thing that I think is very important.” 
The most popular act, Flamenco 016, 
followed the Burke Irish Dancers. The 
group consisted of a guitarist and three

resembling the Irish flag. Older stu­
dents selected their own costumes. The 
fabric and design of each of the costumes 
was unique.

dancers,exhibiting different varieties 
of the Flamenco with a lot of energy 
and finesse.
Members of the group sang as well as 
danced, which added to the excitement 
of the show. There were both male 
and female dancers, which pro­
vided a contrast between the roles 
of men and women in this style of 
dance. The differences in the ages 
of the dancers also illustrated the 
importance of style, as the older 
women strutted across the stage 
with complete confidence in their 
movements, while the younger 
dancers moved with less preci­
sion. Each dancer interpreted the 
Flamenco differently.
The audience seemed to be 
pleased with the program, despite 
its delayed start. All of the perfor­
mances gave a taste of traditional 
ethnic festival dances. It was an 
event complementary to this
- weekend’s celebration of Europe.
Band creates nostalgic night
Last Saturday, students and parents enjoyed playing craps at Monte Carlo Night in the University Center. 
Participants took part in casino games like poker, blackjack, and roulette.
By KATIE KO WALL
Tartan Staffwriter
Although the International Fes­
tival is chock-full of lectures and 
presentations, it would be a 
shame to ignore one of Europe’s 
most prominent contributions to 
the revolution of the 20th cen­
tury — the Beatles.
British Invasion is a Beatles 
tribute band that spared no ex­
pense in bringing the Beatles back 
to CMU. Performing in Rangos 
Hall last Friday night, the four 
members stepped on stage 
dressed in black and white with 
appropriately ’60s-style haircuts 
and thick British accents. At the 
end of each number they did the 
traditional Beatles bow, drawing 
some chuckles and smiles from 
the crowd.
At the beginning of the con­
cert, the crowd was thin. As the 
band started pumping out tunes 
like “Eight Days A Week” and “I 
Want To Hold Your Hand,” 
people were drawn in from out­
side Rangos Hall. At times it
seemed like the parents, most of 
whom were on campus for Fam­
ily Weekend, enjoyed the con­
cert more than the students. Af­
ter all, British Invasion special­
izes in the music of their 
childhood.
The band played a variety of 
covers from different British 
bands. They focused most heavily 
on Beatles songs like Glad All 
Over, Saw Her Standing There, I 
Wanna Hold Your Hand and Do 
You love Me. They also played a 
lot of Rolling Stones songs, and 
some one-hit wonders like the 
Zombies and the Yardbirds.
Many students and parents sat 
side by side and enjoyed the mu­
sic of the past in a fun and ener­
getic environment. “[The concert] 
was a culturally enriching expe­
rience,” saidjunior ECE and busi­
ness double major Rob Harwar, 
as he watched his parents dance 
to “Twist and Shout.”
Sophomore ECE major Ryan 
Moskal enjoyed the spirit of the 
Beatles and of the whole week­
end. “I like the International Fes-
tival. It coincides with Parents’ 
Weekend so families can see how 
the campus can come together as 
a community.”
Students also compared this 
year’s International Festival to 
those of years past. “[This year] 
is a lot better than last year,” said 
sophomore architecture major 
Khuzema Hussain, “Besides ber 
ing set up better, it was better 
publicized. A lot of people knev^ 
about it.”
Senior architecture major 
Young- Joon Chang begged to dif­
fer. “The International Festival 
is usually advertised better. But 
I think it’s a pretty good deal. It?s 
very diverse.”
At British Invasion’s perfor­
mance, this diversity was evident 
— students and families from 
many different ages came to­
gether over the commonality of 
fun ’60s nostalgia. At the close of 
the show, the crowd erupted in 
cheers and screams. The show 
was now alive with people of all 
ethnicities, brought together by 
the sounds of the Beatles.

international festival 1998
entertainment
Ethnic musicians draw from varying sources
By MELISSA MCMAHON
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Saturday evening, as part of the 
International Festival 98: Europe, the 
Alpine music group Alpen Glow filled 
Kirr Commons with the lively music of 
Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and 
other Eastern European countries. This 
authentic music brightened the evening 
for many entertained audience mem­
bers, some of whom danced, clapped, 
and sang along with the front-man’s 
friendly invitation.
Dressed in traditional Lederhosen, this 
five-piece band, a Grammy nominee for 
the past two years, brought music of 
Eastern Europe to the International Fes­
tival with enthusiasm and spirit. The 
band consisted of Joe Grkman, brothers 
'Ron and Tim Stemple, Sam La Barbara, 
and Carl Bruno. Each of them has strong 
Eastern European roots, and 15 years
ethnicity inmusicin West Virginia,’’hesaid, 
explaining how this music fit into his life. “It 
is authentic music from those countries.” 
Alpen Glow played drinking tunes, 
toasts, polkas, and more drinking tunes, 
to the amusement of the audience. The 
instrumentation was unique, consisting 
of various combinations of tuba, trum­
pet, clarinet, accordion, flugel horn, elec­
tric bàss and guitar, banjo, tenor sax, 
and more, often with words sung in 
English or in other languages. The 
Stemple brothers were the primary vo­
calists for the evening.
Many audience members appreciated 
the night’s music and the friendly atmo­
sphere of the International Festival’s 
entertainment. “This is beautiful,” said 
audience member and grandmother 
Adele Brzowsky. “I would dance. [The 
Festival] was organized with a lot of 
good taste. People were accommodating
— it was very well-received.”
Certainly on Family Weekend this is

thing they wanted to explore together, ments of family and traditional lifestyle 
“We really like this European style of with a European theme. Alpen Glow’:

tive. “It’s our heritage. There is a lot of the weekend.

fine arts candidated, and his cast man­
aged to put on a somewhat entertaining 
production, despite a poorly 
written script.
In the opening scene, Marlene (senior 
drama major Jenna Kerlowsky) gath­
ers with women throughout history to 
celebrate the promotion that she has 
received at work. The remainder of this 
play parallels th'e problems of the 
women in the past with those of the 
women that currently work at the Top 
Girls Employment Agency, combining 
the past and present struggle between 
women and the male-dominated soci­
ety that they live in.
The play starts off light and airy as 
each character is introduced. Wine be­
gins to flow, and lips begin to loosen; 
each woman reveals what she has sacri-, 
ficed in order to achieve her power.
Churchill is rather fond of having the 
characters interrupt and speak over one 
another, but the actors had no 
problems with it at all. How­
ever, as the first act wore on, it 
lost its novelty, and thé audi­
ence members had to pick and 
choose which character they 
wanted to listen to, which took 
away from the overall purpose 
of the scene. Leah Akins, a se­
nior drama major, as Isabella 
and Stacey Levi, also a senior 
drama major, as Lady Nijo, in­
teract wonderfully together. It’s 
a shame that there was a con­
tinual struggle to be heard be­
tween the two. It is also un­
nerving that Churchill would 
chose to pit her characters 
against each other as she does, 
especially when the seven 
women on stage were able to 
display such comradery 
among themselves.
The beginning of the first 
scene was charming, but the 
rest of the play was very slow 
and at times melodramatic.
The first scene ended with a 
stage full of crying women 
which was a little unsettling;

to illustrateing in tempo, 
rising tensions.
However, the futuristic sound, an 
unidentifiable Star Trek-esque noise, 
used to separate times and places was 
unneccessary, especially at the begin-
the audience didn’t know what to do 
with themselves. You want to ask, “Are 
they serious?” The scene lacked any 
semblance of dramatic arc.
In fact, the only true driving force 
towards the climax were the sound ef­
fects. For example, the sound designers ning of the play. It was annoying and 
used a bongo drum, gradually increas- it insulted the intelligence of
the audience.
Additionally, the com­
bination of Scottish bag­
pipes and classical music 
at the conclusion of the 
play was a poor choice as 
the two clashed and only 
came across as 
grating noise.
The versatility of the 
seven actresses was im­
pressive; six out of the 
seven played two or more 
characters. “By having 
the same actresses play­
ing different characters, 
we are able to connect the 
stories,” said Hostetler. 
“The women in the Top 
Girl’s Employment 
Agency are linked with 
the historical women and 
the ybung girls to show 
that dreams and 
struggles are not new, 
and they will continue.” 
Despite a poor script, 
Hostetler and his cast put 
on a respectable 
production.

Film’s vampires win 
over skeptic viewers
By RHYS CONLON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
“I can’t get anything to drink here. It’s 
a coffee shop,” says one of the vampires 
in Nadja, a 1995 vampire film written 
and directed by Michael Almereyda, 
which was shown at the Carnegie Mu­
seum of Art this past Saturday.
What: Nadja
Director: Michael Almereyda 
Company: October Films
Over six hundred movies have been 
made about vampires, and when you 
figure that there are really only three 
ways to get rid of them, it seems only 
natural to question why audiences have 
remained fascinated with the citizens of 
Transylvania. Vampires are frighten­
ing, but the endings of movies about 
them become predictable. One can al­
ways be certain that the antagonist will 
be killed in the end by either a fire, a 
stake stuck in their heart, or a ray of 
sunlight. However, for more than a cen­
tury, the movie industry has continued 
to find a way to include these blood­
thirsty fiends.
The first short film about vampires 
was made in 1896. A year later, Bram 
Stoker wrote Dracula, and by the ’40s, 
the character had become popular from 
the film version of Dracula starring Bela 
Lugosi and the dozens and dozens of 
other vampirish flicks. Consequently, 
many later films lacked the surprise and 
tension which earlier ones had guaran­
teed, and audience interest in the sub­
ject dwindled. Stoker’s invention went 
from being horrific to comic as vampires 
became the center of spoofs and B mov­
ies in the ’60s and ’70s.
In recent years, the films have proven 
to be as immortal as the vampires them­
selves. Some credit author Anne Rice 
(Interview With the Vampire) for the 
resurrection. Through special effects and 
more creative storylines, the ’90s have 
given way to a new generation of vam­
pire movies. Nadja is one example. With 
its well-developed characters, intricate 
storyline, and seductive black and white 
photography, Nadja is able to separate 
itself from the glut of vampire movies.
The film focuses on Nadja (Elina
Lowensohn), the daughter of the most 
powerful vampire in the land, who has 
been murdered by the vampire hunter 
Van Helsing (Peter Fonda). Helsing’s 
ultimate goal is to find Nadja and Edgar, 
her twin brother (Jared Harris) in their 
hometown, New York City, in order to 
kill them. Other than the setting, it 
might not seem to be much different 
from other vampire movies. But the plot 
takes a turn.
Helsing takes his nephew, Jim (Martin 
Donovan) under his wing for the adven­
ture, but simultaneously, Nadjais seduc­
ing Jim’s wife. And Edgar, the other 
vampire, isn’t innocent either; he falls in 
love with Jim’s half sister. Through these 
ongoing dilemmas and the effectiveness 
ofNadja’s characterization, Nadja com­
ments on the lack of family values and 
isolation in contemporary society through 
the use of vampires, who are solitary 
beings. This isolation doesn’t necessarily 
apply to only vampires.
The film’s photography also contrib­
utes to its success. Shot entirely in black 
and white and using unconventional 
techniques, the visuals are intriguing 
from the beginning. Cinematographer 
Jim Denault slows down and- double­
exposes sections of the film. He juxta­
poses Nadja against New York in one of; 
the first double exposures in order to; 
emphasize her separation from her sur­
roundings. In the opening scene as she 
describes her loneliness, Denault uses a 
close up of her hooded vampirish face. 
Many of these peculiar shots consist of 
vague and mysterious images and are 
taken in silence while others include 
obscure droning sounds or voice-overs.
At times, Nadja can seem repetitive, 
especially towards the end. The viewer 
becomes immune to the stylish camera 
techniques, and the subtle humor which 
exists in the beginning seems to disap 
pear. Problems also arise with some of the 
minor characters; Jim’s wife, Lucy (Gal­
axy Craze) for example, is less believable 
and more of a stereotypical victim.
However, Lowensohn’s ability to serve 
as a captivating link between her vampire 
world and our present day society is com­
mendable. Her superb acting along with 
the film’s appealing artistic direction and 
complex storyline are what allow this film 
to rise above the average vampire movie.;
Group gives jubilant performance
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Staffwriter
Under the direction of Maestro 
Juan Pablo Izquierdo, the 
Carnegie Mellon Philharmonic 
gave a breathtaking performance 
last Saturday night in Rangos 
Hall. With half the program con­
sisting of a Beethoven symphony 
also performed last week for their 
Homecoming concert, the Phil­
harmonic proved it is not only 
capable of portraying great 
breadths of emotion, but is ca­
pable of doing so consistently.
Take two of Beethoven’s Third 
Symphony, the Eroica, proved to 
be just as heartfelt as the first 
performance. Perhaps more dis­
tinct the second time around were 
the intensity of the pianissimos 
in the first and second move­
ments. Maintaining a full sound 
is often difficult to accomplish at 
such a low dynamic, but the or­
chestra retained its sound even 
as the volume decreased.
The showcase of horns in the 
third movement added much to 
the majestic tone of the piece, 
and at times the sound appeared 
to be emanating from every cor­
ner of the hall. The fourth move­
ment highlighted excellent han­
dling of difficult counterpoint, and 
the flow of the movement was not 
lost on the contrasting phrases.
The orchestra changed gears in 
the second half of the program, 
and devoted the final portion of
the concert to folk dances by Bela 
Bartók and Manuel de Falla.
Bartok’s Roman nepi tancok 
moved very quickly and appeared 
more as one single movement 
with allegro and andante inter­
ludes rather than a piece divided 
into six separate movements. The 
strings were clean and bright, 
providing a beautiful background 
for a jubilant clarinet entrance. 
The clarinet/string echoes con­
tributed a light, carefree effect to 
the piece, and the notes almost 
seemed to bounce off of one an­
other. The flute solo flowed nicely 
over the long tone base of strings, 
clarinets, and bassoons, and 
added a true folk feel to the work. 
The final movement was over­
flowing with energy as the basses 
provided a fervent pulse to the 
movement. The presto tempo was 
wonderfully executed, and the or­
chestra maintained control de­
spite the fast-moving pace.
Manuel de Falla’s Three Cor­
nered Hat was a lively finish to 
the orchestra’s performance. The 
first movement, “The Neighbor’s 
Dance,” showcased the 
orchestra’s ability to carry across 
sudden changes in mood. The tone 
frequently changed from light, 
airy passages to majestic, ener­
gized phrases, but the orchestra 
was able to maintain its intensity 
in both cases.
The second movement, “The 
Miller’s Dance” began with a vi­
brant horn entrance which gave
way to a beautiful English horn 
solo, played with wonderful fa­
cility and vibrato. This move­
ment in particular showcased 
thé orchestra’s skill with dy­
namic. The orchestra created 
veiy sudden fortissimos which 
appeared to come out of no­
where. The French horns stood 
out with their classic round 
sound, and the preci se oboe solo 
contrasted beautifully with the 
energy of the horns. The culmi­
nation of the movement built 
from slow, soft passages and 
then accelerated into heated 
passages accentuated by the ad­
dition of percussion at the end.
The last movement of the 
Three Corneredbrought the. 
concert to an energetic finish. 
The orchestra played the presto 
tempo with excellent technical 
facility. The whirlwind pas­
sages completed the almost 
magical mood set by the first 
two dances. After hearing the 
other portions of the piece, the 
Final Dance became less of its 
own entity, as it had been in the 
Homecoming concert, and more 
of a final chapter. The energy 
literally poured off the stage, 
and the final chords reverber­
ated throughout the room.
The concert was an astound­
ing mix of calm, peaceful move­
ments and bright, energetic 
dances, with the intensity of 
the orchestra drowned out only 
by the audience’s applause.
Jazz combo compels audience
By ANDY FRANCIS
Tartan Staffwriter
Rocking harder than an aver­
age rock group, displaying re­
markable technical skill, and even 
crafting a new song from an audi­
ence member’s suggestion, the 
Jazz Mandolin Project(JMP) 
sponsored by the AB, put on an 
incredible show last Thursday, 
bringing its unique variety of jazz 
to the Mellon Institute.
While some jazz can at times 
become unfocused and concen­
trated on solos, JMP constantly 
kept the crowd engaged with 
clever songs, building tension in 
each until the very end. Consist­
ing of a bassist (upright, to be 
sure), a drummer, and a mando- 
linist, the musicians almost never 
seemed out of sync with each 
other. During the first half of the 
set, the band essentially set forth 
what it is about. Each song moved 
from musical idea to idea, all the 
while increasing the music’s in­
tensity. In songs like “Flux” and 
an untitled song which an audi­
ence member inexplicably dubbed 
“Godzilla Jr,” JMP took a basic 
jazz-rock hook and used all sorts 
of tricks, like a Jimmy Page-like 
bow solo on the bass or a subter­
ranean-sounding groove, to whip 
the music into a frenzy until the 
song’s climax.
The second half of the set was 
quite different; after a strange 
tune involving some Bach refer­
ences, JMP de­
cided to “experi­
ment,” that is, 
create a song 
from someone’s 
suggestion. Hal­
loween was cho­
sen as the theme, 
the lights were 
dimmed, and 
JMP created an 
amazing piece of 
work. Beginning 
with a pulsing, 
almost industrial 
sound, JMP em­
ployed tornado­
like drumming, 
eerie noises, dark 
instrumentation, 
some mandolin-bass interplay, 
and even the theme from the 
Addams Family to compose a 
piece that brought the audience 
to their feet.
The idea of incorporating a 
mandolin into jazz music might 
seem like something of a gim­
mick, but the Jazz Mandolin

The Sweet Hereafter
Call your mom! You’ll understand why after you 
see this melancholy Atom Egoyan film, which exam­
ines the many coping strategies that people use to 
deal with tragedy. In this case, the tragedy is a 
school bus accident that leaves 14 children dead and 
many others injured. The anger and grief from this 
accident have paralyzed the parents in this small 
Adirondack town, most of whom had children on the 
bus. A lawyer who has lost contact with his own 
daughter arrives to convince the parents to file a 
class action lawsuit as a way to get revenge and 
move on with their lives. Some of them agree with 
him while others see him as a leech trying to make 
money off of their suffering. Now, go give her a call.

Mask of Zorro
Who else but Antonio Banderas could play Zorro, 
the smoldering Latin rebel who fights injustice with 
his sword? Well, Anthony Hopkins for one. In this 
film, he plays Zorro Senior, a.k.a. the original Zorro, 
who fights the tyranny of the evil landowner Don 
Rafael Montero in late 19th century Mexico. But, 
after Montero kills his wife and takes his baby 
daughter, he is forced to go into hiding. A couple of 
decades later he finally emerges onto the streets 
where he meets up with Alejandro (Banderas), who 
also hates Montero. Then Alejandro must be trained, 
a la Bufiy the Vampire Slayer and the Karate Kid, 
to become the new Zorro so that together they can 
get rid of Montero for good. Catherine Zeta-Jones 
also stars (I guess Salma Hayak was busy) as Zorro 
Senior’s long-lost daughter who, obviously, falls for 
Zorro Numero Dos.

Fatboy Slim
You've Come a Long Way, Baby— 
Astralwerks
Fatboy Slim titles his latest col­
lection of huge techno beats, funk- 
rock, and electronic sounds You've 
Come A Long Way, Baby, a phrase 
which could easily be applied to 
Fatboy himself. Norman Cook, 
after playing in and DJing for 
about a dozen bands and under 
as many aliases, has finally 
settled on the identity of Fatboy 
Slim. He’s doing something he 
really excels at: making
exciting music.
Like he did on 1997’s Better 
Living Through Chemistry, 
Fatboy Slim stitches together bits 
of rock, soul, funk, and even a 
gospel track, laying down a beat, 
throwing in a vocal loop or two, 
and just seeing what happens. 
The results here are overwhelm­
ingly positive, especially the ubiq­
uitous single “The Rockafeller 
Skank,” which pairs a rapped line 
(“Right about now, the funk soul 
brother”) with a surf guitar riff 
and produces one of the more 
memorable tunes of the summer.
“Breakbeat” is the term com­
monly used to reference Fathoms 
sect of electronic music, and 
throughout You've Come A Long 
Way, Baby he applies these beats 
to anything he can get his hands 
on. “Gangster Tripping” illus­
trates the convergence of hip-hop 
and techno, and the intriguing 
“Praise You” somehow finds a 
Fatboy Slim song in a contempo­
rary gospel melody. However, later 
in the album, Fatboy veers away 
fromhis splice-rock creations, with 
less compelling results.
Fatboy Slim has, in fact, made 
one of the more exciting albums 
of the year: a big, spectacular 
work that goes out of its way to be 
noticed. You’ve Come a Long Way, 
Baby is filled with fun hooks and 
big beats, and it’s difficult not to 
enjoy something that tries this 
much just to be fun.

Grooverider
Mysteries of Funk-
Grooverider is one of the undis­
puted legends in the UK jungle 
scene. That said, his first full- 
length release, Mysteries of Funk, 
falls below the expectations held 
for someone of his stature.
Mysteries of Funk's biggest 
shortcoming is the same one that 
many techno full-lengths have. 
Since techno is a singles-based 
genre, it’s all too easy to create an 
album that’s a couple of outstand­
ing singles mixed with filler. The 
high quality of the singles is ap­
parent here: “Where’s Jack the 
Ripper?” with its claustrophobic 
darkness and the slightly off-kil­
ter jazz of “Rainbows of Colour.” 
However, the filler is also bla­
tant: “On the Double” comes 
across as uninspired, and “Imagi­
nation (Parts 1 & 2)” is quite 
unimaginative.
Mysteries of Funk works best 
when the mood of the music is 
dark or quirky. “Cybernetic Jazz,” 
the album opener, is funky un- 
easy-listening.
Overall the album is above av-

copy of Madonna’s Ray of Light. 
The End is High certainly has its 
high points — “A Planet Made of 
Rain” combines high beats-per- 
minute with some interesting 
techno-inspired electronic builds 
and spoken lyrics.
Unfortunately, most of the 
album’s other songs aren’t as suc­
cessful. Lyrics that might be pow­
erful in the mouth of U2 (“for love/ 
would you kill/would you kill for 
love?”) become vapid when Blink 
mixes them with New Wave 
dance beats.
And while the vocals aren’t pain­
ful on the eardrums, sending the 
album for a spin in your CD player 
certainly isn’t going to make you 
think you’re listening to the 
next Pavarotti.
Although the techno twist on 
Blink’s primarily alterna-pop 
sound could have been magical, 
the band didn’t push its limits

bum. It has some strong features

Action movie examines personality genes
By ROB CULLEN
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In Soldier, Kurt Russell plays, well, a sol­
dier. But he’s not just any soldier. He’s part of 
a group of men who have been trained since 
birth by some sort of military agency to be 
fighting machines. They don’t know how to 
do anything except fight and follow orders. 
They have absolutely no emotions, but they 
will do anything their superior officers tell 
them to do, even if it means their own certain 
death. Although it poses intriguing questions 
concerning identity and the engineering of 
personalities, this film is little more than a 
string of violent sequences.
In the future, about 40 years from now, a 
new type of supersoldier is developed. These 
soldiers were created to be much faster and 
stronger by tinkering with their DNA. In a 
fight ordered by the superior officers, Russell’s 
character, Todd, is beaten up and presumed 
dead. So they toss him on a garbage-carting
spaceship and dump him on another planet 
where they leave discarded machines. Here 
he is befriended by a small colony of people 
who are stranded on the planet. However, 
there isn’t any war occuring, and this is all 
Todd knows, so he is more than a little out of 
place. The colonists try teaching him about 
human compassion and emotion, but he re­
ally doesn’t get it.
What: Soldier 
Director:Paul Anderson 
Company: Morgan Creek
The rest of the movie takes a fascinating 
look at whether personality is formed more 
by genes or by upbringing—despite the fact 
that peace on the planet lasts all of maybe 
five minutes of the movie, until the geneti­
cally enhanced supersoldiers land there to 
start training. The soldiers start shooting 
missiles and what-not at the colonists, who
really can’t fight back, so it is up to Todd to 
defend them. The rest of the movie is typical 
— a one-man army bloodbath, as Todd goes 
up against 20 or so supersoldiers.
There are a few other familiar faces be­
sides Kurt Russell. Gary Busey, apparently 
working on his attempt to be in every action 
movie ever made, plays one of the military 
commanders and surprisingly, for once he 
does not play the most psychotic character in 
the movie. Not that he’s overly lovable, but 
it’s a slight change of pace for him to play 
someone who is even remotely sane.
There are some impressive visual special 
effects in this movie, and an interesting sci­
entific question is asked, but chances are 
that the main motivation for seeing this 
movie is the desire to see a lot of things 
blowing up and Kurt Russell shooting a whoDe 
bunch of people. If this is the case, then you 
won’t be disappointed. But if you’re looking 
for an overall high-quality movie, this i|s 
definitely not it.

Everybody knows that Halloween used to be known as 
All Hallow's Eve, a celebration of the evening before All 
Saints' Day. Fewer people know that the origins are traced 
back to the ancient Celtic festival called Samhein, celebrated 
on the night before the new year. Samhein marked the end of 
the harvest season and the beginning of the cold winter. It was 
believed that on this night, the souls of the dead would rise 
again to visit places where they had lived. People dressed in 
costume to play it safe with the wicked spirits that roamed with 
the souls. Huge bonfires were set to frighten these witches and 
wicked spirits away while food and lanterns were set out to wel­
come ghosts and dead souls. These pagan observances eventually influ­
enced All Hallow's Eve. The Irish created the idea of trick-or-treating. 
Groups of villagers would go from house to house begging for food for a 
community feast. Those w ho gave generously were promised a prosper­
ous year and those who gave little were threatened and cursed. It took a 
while for these customs to be accepted in America after the Irish brought 
them over during the late 1800s. Anoka, Minnesota, celebrated the first 
official city-wide observance of Halloween with a pumpkin bowl, a cos­
tumed square dance, and two parades. After that, it was only a matter of 
time before the holiday became popular. But the traditional pagan ideas 
have been lost. Instead of true fright and terror, we are left with costumed 
brats on the streets and Godzilla to laugh at.
