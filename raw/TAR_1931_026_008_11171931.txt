AT Y.M.&W.H.A,
Recitai Given By Tenor Sunday Evening
Dino Borgioli, tenor, will pre­
sent a recital at the Y. M. & W. 
H. A. building, Bellefield and Fifth 
Avenues, next Sunda>r evening, 
November 22. He has received the 
honorary title of "Commendatore” 
Dino Borgioli from the Associa­
tion .of the, Tuscans in Rome ‘‘for 
perpetuating the glorious tradition 
of the art of ‘bcl canto.’.”
Borgioli has traveled' extensively 
through Italj1-, and has made ap­
pearances in Spain, England, South 
America, Australia and the United 
States. He is a proficient pianist, 
and is well versed in all branches 
of music. He studied during his 
¦youth but did not make his opera­
tic debut until after the World 
war. His many early successes 
in Italy brought him commands to 
appear in royal courts and in per­
formances honoring royalty.
In addition to the Borgioli re­
cital, a series of illustrated musical 
lectures are being presented at the 
Y. M. & W. H. A. every Monday

the Lcipsig Conservatory, where 
lie studied piano and harmony. 
Harris, who studied in Europe two 
years ago, is a former pupil of 
Lissfelt and now assists him in 
his teaching.
Mr. Lissfelt tells many interest­
ing stories about his travels in 
Europe, and makes his lectures 
?eem like a personal tour of the 
'music world.

New Affair to Become 
One of Campus’ 
Traditions
Announcement has been made at 
Carnegie Institute that the prize of 
$200, known as the Popular Prize, 
is again to be offered by the Fine 
A rts . Committee, in -connection with 
the Thirtieth International Exhibi­
tion.
The award of this prize will be 
determined by the vote of visitors 
to the exhibition during the two 
weeks, November 15 to November 
29, inclusive. Each visitor, during 
that period, will be given, a ballot 
on which to vote for his favorite 
painting in the International. The 
award will be made to the artist 
HONRA painting receives the great­
est number of votes. The public, 
in selecting the Popular Prize paint­
ing, will have greater freedom and 
wider scope in which to make their 
decision than did the Jury of 
Award. This., year 38 artists arc 
ineligible for the First Carnegie 
Prize. However, only five artists 
arc ineligible to win the Popular 
Prize. One of these is Leopold 
Seyffert, who was awarded the 
Popular Prize last year. This prize 
cannot be awarded two years in 
succession to the same artist.
The purpose of the prize is to 
stimulate interest in the exhibition, 
to encourage visitors to study the 
paintings, and to offer them the 
opportunity to express their opin­
ions after their own standards of 
criticism. i
This is the eighth ,time that such 
an award has been given at the 
annual International Exhibition. 
Last year the Popular Prize was 
awarded to Leopold Seyffert for 
his “Portrait of Marion Eckhart.”
A new tradition will be estab­
lished here on Saturday, when a 
testimonial to the football team in 
the form of a dance will bp given. 
The dance will be known as the, 
Blanket Hop, its purpose being to 
present to the graduating mem­
bers ' of the football team who 
have become three letter men suit­
able recognition for their efforts. / 
Large red blankets carrying the 
players’ names and the letter “C” 
will be presented to the three 
seniors, Captain Armcntrout, Alex 
Ducanis and¦- Don Fletcher. The 
presentation program will be con­
ducted by Hal Brennan, president 
of the Student Council. The re­
maining members of the ^football 
team will attend the dancc, which 
will be the final football "clance of 
jthe year and which will serve as a 
rally before the N. Y. U. game.
The Madcaps, a local eight-piece 
orchestra, will make its first ap­
pearance on the campus at the 
Hop. The dancing will continue 
from 9 till 12.
The affair will take place in the 
Union and the admission will be 
$1.25, the customary charge for all 
regular football dances. Patrons 
include Mr. and Mrs./Buddy Ovcr- 
end, Bob Waddell, A1 Irwin, Max 
Hannum, Laiiahan and Laboon.
Testimonial dances of the nature 
of this Blanket Hop arc given at

Seriously Speaking
A Column of World News Events 
By NATHAN MILLER
The Shrieking Ether
Is there any excuse . for the 
caterwauling and miscellaneous 
yammering which makes up the 
goodly part of our radio -pro­
grams? Is it inevitable that the 
menu of the air should be quite 
so unsufferable?
The radio is another example of 
the modern custom of perverting 
and degrading a marvelously in­
genius instrument. We have al­
lowed it to be usurped by private 
commercial interests who have, as 
usual, tried to make as much profit 
out of it as possible for them­
selves. And in so doing, nothing 
is too base or blatant, too nfe- 
diocrc or common, to ballyhoo 
one’s wares.
Many of us would like to dis­
cover some area or place where 
we might escape the pestiferous 
insinuations and “messa'ges” of 
persons anxious to inveigle us into 
the purchase of things we have no 
desire to own or use. To heap 
insult on injurj-, we now learn 
that even our homes are not the 
ultimate sanctuary against this 
mean and crass commercialism, for 
as soon as one turns the dial (in 
sheer idleness, perhaps), one is
immediately bombarded by the 
same sort of strident nonsense. 
For sheer effrontery and stupid 
insistence, one cannot -match our 
commercial radio programs. But 
a long-suffering public (still dazed 
from the sad deflation of prosper­
ity) receives it all helplessly if not 
enthusiastically. *
Occasionally, we are treated by 
the radio magnates to -tidbits of 
fine music or entertainment, but 
these we soon learn are used sim­
ply as "sustaining programs” - to 
fill in time unlil the coffee mer­
chants, the toothpaste alchemists 
and the cigarct bedizeners begin 
to work on us again.
By contrast, one may mention 
the system used in England where 
by the radio is owned and pro­
grammed by a government corpor­
ation with the avowed purpose, 
not of money snatching, but for 
educational, cultural and entertain­
ment purposes. And what a mar­
velous instrument this can be foj 
the .elevation, or at least training 
of public morale and standards. 
Those in the know declare that 
British programs are far superior 
to ours.
But as long as we are willing 
to allowr certain acquisitive indi-

(Editorial)
Why Give a Dollar?
Carnegie has joined the Welfare Drive; it has volun­
teered the support of its student body in a nation wide campaign to alleviate suffering during the present depres­
sing conditions. Student solicitors are now working^ the 
campus, affording an opportunity for direct contributions. 
Should a student body, a number of whose members arc not residents of this district, give to the support of local re­
lief? The answer lies in a realization of present conditions, 
and of the necessity for immediate relief.
The majority of us are not inherently selfish, and do have moments of pity, of generosity, and,of spiritual nobil­
ity, when we are roused to awareness by some sudden 
glimpse of human need, or of a drabness that leaves us silent and ashamed. We are impressed; we at3^ willing to 
make a gesture of good will and lend a hand in relief; but we are carried on by the optimism of youth and readily 
forget. The several cases of this nature that come to our 
attention are aided somewhat, but what about the innum­erable cases of suffering, hunger, and want which pass our 
attention—who will care for them?A community organization has been formed -which em­
braces practically every branch of charity and relief work 
necessary to care for our unfortunates, in a systematic pro­
gram of welfare and relief. It is known as the Welfare Fund and is at present conducting its single campaign per year 
for means of carrying out its plan.
The giving to a community drive might not carry with 
it the realization of actual,service as in the case when some ¦woeful need affects one personally. It is not a case of seeing 
and then giving, one must use their imagination and try to picture the entire panorama with a great organization work­
ing to solve the age-old problems making possible happi­ness and well-being. If such can be the case, Carnegie’s por­
tion of the great budget will be fully subscribed. IC

“TRANSMUTATION” 
IS LECTURE TOPIC
Dr. Nathanson to Speak At Physics Colloquium on Tuesday
“Transmutation” is the topic 
that Dr. J. B. Nathanson, a mem­
ber of the physics department, will 
discuss at the next meeting of the 
Physics Colloquium, Tuesday morn­
ing, November 24, at 8:30, in room 
113, Engineering Hall. Everyone 
is welcome.
Transmutation of elements from 
a base metal to% a fine metal was 
always dreamt of by the old al­
chemists. Chemical- methods, how­
ever, have failed to. bring such a 
change. It was left for the sci­
ence of radio activity to show that 
transmutation of heavier elements 
docs go on; for example, the elc-; 
ment, radium, which is a metal, 
changes to a gas, radon, an­
other metal with also expulsion 
from the radium of an alpha par­
ticle, tlic alpha particlc being the 
positive chargcil nuclcus of a 
helium atom.
By bombarding lighter elements 
with high speed alpha particlcs 
several investigators abroad have 
made possible the transmutation 
of these lighter elements. In a 
sense, then, transmutation is a 
reality, but amounts produced arc ex­
ceedingly minute, dctectiblc only with 
great difficulty. So far as transmuta­
tion of heavier elements is conccrncd ; 
that is, mercury. ' to ^gold, several 
attempts have been made during 
the past decade but results are 
still open to question. ,
Transmutation is considered by 
many as a very important and vi­
tal subject. Leading scientists vis­
ion a new era in Physics when the 
atom will at least be smashed.

penetrable by controable- agencies

fered to the use of coal as a fuel, 
while the afternoon will be devoted 
to technical problems and solutions 
now facing the industry. Among the 
problems open for discussion in the 
various halls today arc gassification, 
economics of low and high tempera­
ture carbonization, pulverized fuel, 
power plant fuel, and application 
of coal distillation.
The conference opened yesterday 
with an address by Dr. Thomas S. 
Baker, chairman, nnd will continue 
through to the 21st. Following him, 
Myron C. Taylor, chairman of the 
finance committee of the United 
States Steel Corporation, spoke on 
the economics of the bituminous 
coal industry in this country. He 
was followed by Governor Albert C. 
Ritchie, of Maryland, Avho presented 
the governmental and legal aspccts 
of the industry. The last speaker at 
the morning session was Sir Harry 
E. Brittain, of England, a member 
of the Council of the Associated 
Chambers of Commerce. Sir Harry 
told (he delegates of Great Britain’s 
coal problems and described the ef­
fects of the recent financial crisis on 
the British Coal Industry.
Since,many of the foreigners who 
have contributed papers were unable 
to make the trip to America, they 
have sent their papers in to be read 
during the meetings. However the 
roster of delegates from abroad con­
tains the names of the leaders in 
fuel technology.
Among those who have arrived arc 
Dr. Franz Fischer, widely known for 
his process for making oil from coal; 
Prof, R. V. Wheeler, of the Uni­
versity of Sheffield, outstanding Eng­
lish authority on coal problems and 
pioneer in the use of stone dust 1o 
prevent colliery explosions; Prof. 
Cecil H. Dcsch, prominent metallurgist 
of England, now lecturing at Cor­
nell University; Dr. George L. 
Stadnilcoff, of the 'Karpov Institute,

INSTITUTE GETS 
28th PAINTING
“Babette” Acquired Through Patrons Art Fund
Carnegie Institute has acquired 
the painting ''Babette” by Eugene 
Spcichcr, which is now on exhibi­
tion in the present International 
Art Exhibition. This announce­
ment was made last evening by 
Homer Saint-Gaudens, Director of 
Fine Arts. It was purchased 
through the Patrons Art Fund. 
This Fund, provided by 21 citizcns 
of Pittsburgh, enables the Depart­
ment of Fine Arts 'to secure paint­
ings for its Permanent Collection. 
Through the Fund, since its estab­
lishment in 1922, 28 paintings have 
been added to the collection of the 
Carnegie Institute,
The painting "Babette” has been 
unanimously praised by critics and 
public as one of the most important 
in the present International Ex­
hibition. Many people have sug­
gested that it might have received 
first prize, had it been eligible. It 
was not considered for a prize be­
cause the artist, Eugene Speichcr, 
was a member of the Jury of 
Award.
“Babette” undoubtedly marks the 
highest point in the development 
of one of America's most distin­
guished painters. His originality, 
strength, individuality, rhythm, ex­
traordinary and unique color sense, 
combine to make this painting an 
achievement of the highest order. 
Before it the academician and the 
modernist can rcach an understand­
ing, and this without the artist 
yielding or conceding to either. 
I-Ierc is a painter displaying in all 
fullness his knowledge and tech­
nical equipment, plus that personal, 
intangible quality which makes for 
a great achievement.
There is a refreshing naturalness 
about the entire picturc. The plain 
bit of interior, relieved by the

Skibo Senior Trio To Receive Awards At Blanket Hop
Capt.
I ARNEGIE’S PASSING FANCY was cvi- 
dentally. too much for the Temple Owla to 
swallow in one half of a football game, especially when it meant that their unde­feated record of 1931 was doomed. Although 
the Tartans scored their nineteen winning 
points during the first half, the game could not be considered in the bag until the umpire 
got up enough steam to blow his final blast. 
A rejuvenated flock to Owls began the second half like a winning team, and so manipulated 
their aerial attack as to score two touch­
downs plus an extra point.
_ George Kavcl put in a great day of ball
carrying, vieorge pulled a surprise when he copped Dueger’s pass and then dodged and spun through twenty-five yards of 
Temple tacklers for the initial Skibo touchdown. Iiis intcr- 
sception of an enemy heave paved the way for the second six- 
counter, and later discouraged the Temple team by recovering 
one of their fumblqs.Hook Sample put his usual trade mark on the_ Temple backfield, this transaction frequently taking place behind^ their 
line of scrimmage. Captain Armentrout, hampered by injuries, 
v/as unable to gain his accustomed yardage during the short 
time he was in the game. With the N. Y. U. game more than a week off, the unavailable material should simmer down to 
Lewis and O’Toole. It is possible that Clyde Iieinzer’s knee
may recover before the final game.

UARTERBACK STEW DUEGER found 
himself at the very bottom of everything 
after he plunged through center for the 
second touchdown. His famous sneak play 
was not much of a secret to the Temple
eleven for it was apparent that nearly
twenty-two 'men met oyer his horizontal 
projection.
Johnny Sayles, a first-rate sophomore 
substitute, tore things up considerably dur­
ing his ball toting escapade at the end of
the first half. After Stewart had recovered a
Temple fumble, Sayles personally conducted 
the oval for some thirty yards to the final
.Viaid touchdown. This running back is sure to see plenty of
¡action in (lie prid seasons to come.>H i|< )|c >l< >l< He
TARTAN HARRIERS arrived at the long end of a 81 to 
34 score against the West Virginia country side runners, but the peculiar system of counting the score gives the verdict to 
the Mountaineers. The course was cpvcred in rather fast time with four West Virginia men leading most of the way. Captain 
Jess Price, running under adverse physical conditions, finished ,:i close third, clipping about fifteen seconds from his usual time, 
Bob Schell, fifth runner to cross the end line, lowered his time 
toy one minute.Although the freshmen cross-country runners were literally 
'"fed up" by the Shadyside Academy to the extent of a delect- 
¡able dinner, the Plebca managed to take the meet by a 15 to 40 
score.
Next Friday afternoon both varsity and freshmen teams of 
Carnegie and Pitt will run it out over the Schenlcy course. Al­
though they W'cre defeated by the Army harriers last week end 
¡the Panthers have a keen edge over the Plaid runners.

¡functions we find ourselves drifting indoors where new centers

Sought cover in the gym and our remodeled rifle range.
THE BASKETBALL SQUAD is due to put in an ap 
pearance this week. A large number of experienced candidates arc expected to stage a real battle for positions on this year’s 
floor team. It will not be necessary to dust the proverbial cob webs from the baskets for quite a few of the depcndablcs have 
been sinking some “long ones” and indulging in those bone- ¡crushing scrimmages where referees are unknown.
* * * * *' ¦ .*
MORE THAN A SCORE OF BOXING, candidates arc go­
ing through their paces with the indication that the Skibo team 
.will be supported with a larger assortment ring ,men than was 
present last year. Carr, Atlas and Wertz, .a, trio ivho entered 
the boxing game for the first time last year, have shown a 
decided improvement in recent work outs. Coach Sesto is still 
awaiting any new aspirants who would like to try their hand 
in a boxing glove. Plebcs seeking a managing job should also report for duty.******
TARTAN TANKMEN have been splashing about in their own special way, and are none the worse for the month of faith­
ful training that is behind them. The varsity men are rounding 
into a seasonable shape, while the Plebes have shown a small 
amount of their well-needed improvement. The coaching duties are taken over by Captain Bill Edwards until the return of Coach Risedorph near the end of this semester. We are glad 
to hear from the Boston hospital that Mr. Risedorph is on the road to recovery.

VERYTHING in the,way of pomp and cere­
mony will be blended into the Blanket Hop 
next Saturday night. The coaches and gradu­
ate manager of the football team as well as 
the entire team are being feted nt this testi­
monial dance. •
( The interest: of the evening will center 
about ^ Captain Murray Armentrout, Alex 
Ducanis, and Don Fletcher, veteran Skibo 
seniors who have done creditable work on 
the gridiron for the past three seasons. 
Their efforts will be acknowledged with the 
presentation of large red blankets bearing 
the coveted “C.” It is hoped that this adt of recognition will be 
rontinued as a Carnegie tradition bestowed upon those who 
lave done exceptional work in the line of Tartan athletics.
Next Saturday night Carncgié’s 
music-minded public will mingle 
with the “iron men” of the Skibo 
football squad in the first annual 
Blanket Hop held at the -institu­
tion.
Large red blankets, possessing a 
C", will be presented to Captain 
Armentrout, Alex Ducanis, and 
Don Fletcher.
Throughout his three seasons of 
varsity play, Alex Ducanis has ful­
filled his center position- with ut­
most consistency. 
His accurate 
passing and stel­
lar defensive 
work made him 
a n indespensible 
player. Things 
. work so smooth­
ly when Duke is 
in their plugging 
away for his ab­
sence from the 
line-up is surely 
n o t i c c a ble. It 
must also be re­
membered that 
Ducanis was cap-
Armentrout, Ducania, Fletcher to Be Honored
C wensHoldTal
tain of the first Skibo boxing team, 
and always did a skillful job with 
the gloves.
Murray Giles Armentrout has 
also seen action7 on two other var­
sity elevens besides the one he is 
leading now. Murray is one of 
those all-round players who finally 
settled down in the backfield to 
share the brunt of the ball carr3f-
Tradition Inaugurated Fete Football Team
to
ing position. His ability to tote 
several tacklers before being 
downed makes his playing popular 
with everyone. Army has broken 
the hammer throw rccord of the 
track team, and also performed in 
the role of a high hurdler when 
tlecessary.
Don Fletcher’s playing at guard 
and tackle for the past three sea­
sons will be remembered in Plaid 
football history. He is the big­
gest man on the team, and does a 
great deal more than just fill his 
position on the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦I 
line. Don’s ap­
pearance last sea­
son was some­
what limited due 
to the fact that 
that his knee 
was not in the 
best physical 
shape. However, 
an operation fixed 
the works and 
his. performance 
this season was 
of the highest 
caliber.-
TARTAN GRID TEAM 
SEEKS SECOND WIN 
OVER NEW YORK U.
-This year’s Carncgic-N. Y. U. 
football game will mark the sixth 
meeting of the Skibos and the 
Violets on the gridiron and will 
afford Carnegie an opportunity to 
score her second victory over
Coach Chick Meehan’s outfit.
Relations were opened with N. 
Y. U, in 1926 ..and have continued 
uninterrupted since that year. Car- 
n'egie had one of the greatest
teams in her history that year, 
only one team, W. & J., being 
2 to register a touchdown 
against the Plaid that season.
West Virginia, Notre Dame, and 
Pitt were all held scoreless, while 
the SteiTcn-Waddell coached elev­
en piled up the points, but N. Y. 
U. had an ace in the hole to com­
bat the strong forward Avail of 
the Skibos in a Sophomore back 
known- as Ken Strong. This indi­
vidual placed kickcd two field goals 
to give the Violets a 6-0 win that 
season. ' • :
N. Y. U. Shatters Carnegie’s Hopes
The next season the New York­
ers defeated another better than 
average Carnegie team* in New 
York. 20-6. The 1928 game saw 
the Easterners coming to Pitts­
burgh for the first time and with 
anything but a happy task con­
fronting them. The Carnegie 
team of that year was the best 
in the history of the school and 
was looked upon as the outstand­
ing team of the season. The Tar­
tans had marched roughshod over 
Notre Dame, Pitt, W. & J. and 
Georgetown, and one more victory 
Was all they needed to clinch the 
title and an invitation to the Rose 
Bowl. Their victory over George­
town a team that had already 
scorcd a win over N. Y. U. estab­
lished the Skibos as a- slight fa­
vorite prior to the game.
What happened that bleak No­
vember afternoon has gone down 
as football history. Carnegie's All- 
American quarterback, , Howard 
Harpster and Ken Strong, the 
same boy that had been so much 
poison to the Skibo eleven in the 
1926 game, and himself an All- 
American halfback, fought an in­
dividual duel that roused even th< 
least partisan fans. The score of' 
27-13 would seem to indicate that 
the Violets had things pretty much 
their own way. Despite the ap­
parent supremacy as indicated by 
the score the fans were- on th 
edge of their scats from whistle to 
whistle. A master' bit of psychol­
ogy by the Easterners running all 
their plays to the right, even tak­
ing the ball at the far left of the 
field instead of the center when 
Carnegie kicked over the goal line.
FRESHMEN RUNNERS 
DEFEAT SHADYSIDE
On Armistice day, Shadyside 
Academy was host to the Carnegie 
Tech freshmen cross-country team 
in the annual meeting of the two 
schools. This meeting has grown 
into a yearly affair, and Shadyside, 
while it never has a strong cross- 
counti'y team, graciously puts on 
the event solely for Carnegie 
Tech’s benefit. It is just this sort 
of thing for which Shadyside is 
famous, and has helped to build 
up the wonderful feeling, which 
exists between the Academy and 
Tcch,
The race itself came out as ex­
pected, the plebes winning 15-40,

BASKET BALL TEAM 
TO BEGIN PRACTICE
Rifle Team .Reports
For First Practice
The Carnegie Tech varsity and 
plcbc. basketball teams had their 
first practice -of the season yester­
day afternoon in the gymnasium. 
Rajpli Hogan arrived in Pitts­
burgh Sunday and immediately 
called together his basketball men 
and sent them , through a practice 
session in order to get them into 
shape for the first game which is 
only a month away.
This year’s schedule is the most 
extensive and the hardest that any 
Carnegie floor team has ever en­
gaged in. It consists of 26 game's, 
most of which arc with major 
teams of the East and Middle- 
West. To go through this sched­
ule Coach Hogan has almost a 
veteran team from last year on 
hand and in addition several fine 
players from last year’s freshman 
squad.
Tartans Have Veteran Team
Jimmy Leonard, stellar guard, 
on last year's' team is Captain, and 
lie with Jim Fergus, Ed Stcntz, 
Bob Smith and Siegel will form the; 
nucleus from which Coach Hogan 
will form his new team. Rauda- 
haugh, Jagnow and Silverman, the 
outstanding players on the fresh­
man team, will make the scram-, 
ble for varsity positions still more 
difficult.
The quality of Captain Leonard 
has been evident for three years 
on Carnegie Tcch basketball teams'. 
Fergus, a junior, who was chosen 
as guard on the Press all district 
team should prove a menace to 
his opposing forwards, this year. 
Bob Smith, another junior, and a 
tall husky forward, was probably 
the most consistent player on the 
team last year. \i big Ed. Stcntz 
improves as much this yeai' as lie 
did last year, big things should be 
expected of him. Jagnow and 
Rattdabaugh arc two of the flashi­
est players that have ever enrolled 
at Tcch and with a year of experi­
ence on the plcbc team they should 
be able to look forward to a suc­
cessful year.
With plentiful material, new 
equipment and a good range, 
Coach Sommers sees a successful 
year ahead for the Carnegie Tech 
Rifle Squad. . Captain Painter, high 
point man of last year, Buse, 
Scherba and Beckert are the only 
remaining varsity men. Forty-five 
new men reported last Wednesday, 
eleven of whom had previous ex­
perience. Through elimination by 
high score, the squad \ will 'be cut 
to 15 men. Four shoulder to shoul­
der matches are the only definite 
meets as yet scheduled. There 
will be. 30 matches in all, mostly 
telegraphic.
Last year, Carnegie placed fourth 
in national competition and third 
the Hearst tropl^ meet. Car­
negie’s third 'place score 'in the 
Hcarst meet rated higher than 
West Virginia’s third place scorc, 
only West Virginia was in the
PLAID HARRIERS 
LOSE FIRST MEET
A strong West Virginia cross­
country team snapped the winning 
streak of the Carnegie Tech harriers 
last Saturday by the scorc of 21-34. 
The. Skibos undoubtedly ran their 
best race of this season, but the op­
position was a little too stiff. West 
Virginia has one of the best cross­
country teams ever developed in this 
district, and it is very much to Car­
negie’s credit to have made the racc 
as close as it was. Dcvcrs of West 
Virginia won in the exceptional
time of 28:10 and was followed 
closely by a teammate, Zunmerman. 
Captain Jess Price was the . first 
Tartan harrier to rcach the finish
line, leading Captain Brand of West 
Virginia. Jess’ time of 28:31 was
only three seconds slower than his 
school rccord. Schell of Carnegie
was fifth and nosed out T. Price of 
the opposing team for this place! 
Ramsey was the third Carnegie man 
and Allen, a sophomore of much 
promise was fourth. Burns, after two 
years of courageous perscvcrancc in 
cross-country,. broke into the scoring 
as fifth Carnegie man and should 
bear watching in the future.
Friday, November 20, at 4 p. m., 
Tech winds up the home season, 
meeting Pitt over the Schcnley Park 
course. A victory over Pitt in cross­
country, as in other sports, means a 
successful season, but the team will 
have to, run even better than they 
did last Saturday if this victory is 
to be obtained. Next Tuesday the 
team entrains for New York where 
N. Y. U. will be met on Wednesday, 
November 25, at 4 p. m. over the 
championship Van Courtland Park 
course.
Southern Division. Carnegie’s rifle 
team has been consistently good 
since its origination. They have 
competed against such schools as 
Cornell, Naval Academy, West 
Virginia and Penn State with great 
success. Coach Sommers is en­
thusiastic over the showing of the 
new candidates and believes the 
team will, add more laurels to its 
splendid past record.
The new range, which is under 
the Margaret Morrison building, 
was designed by. Shcrba, a mem­
ber of the team.
Archery
An intercollegiate telegraphic 
archcry meet will be sponsored this 
3'car for the first time by the De­
partment of Physical Education of 
the University of Pittsburgh. The 
meet will include colleges and uni­
versities from all over the country. 
Every girl participating in the archery 
contest is asked to see Helen Smith 
as soon as possible to tell her what 
date would b'c most convenient. Ar­
rangements must be made soon as 
the University of Pittsburgh is
anxious to hear from Carnegie Tcch
at the earliest possible date.
Phillip Rounsevelle, one of. the 
foremost archery teachers in the 
United States, has offered to come 
to the University of Pittsburgh to 
give archcry lessons for one week. 
.He can not come unless the class 
is made up of 100 or 150 girls. If 
100 girls will, sign up, the instruc­
tion fee will be $1.50; if 150 girls 
will sign up for the course, the fee
will be $1 for each girl for one
week. If any girl is interested in 
taking these lessons for one' week, 
please .communicate with Helen 
Smith immediately and also tell her. 
the date most convenient.
Bowling
Bowling practices have started and 
are held every Tuesday and Wed­
nesday afternoons, at the Murray- 
Bcacon ‘'alleys. Each girl should have, 
at the end of the season,' an average 
of four lines a week. Attend prac­
tices regularly if you care to take 
part in the intramural bowling con­
test. If you arc in doubt as to 3rour 
standing, sec , Berenice Converse be­
fore it is too late. Every participant 
is allowed two lines each on two 
days or three lines on one da3r with 
boj'S to set up the pins. Do not use 
more than the allotted, amount so 
that every girl may have an equal 
opportunity. Help each other by set­
ting up, pins for- one another, and 
thus the weekly number of lines will 
be used in accordance" with- the 
schedule.
Rifle
Practices are being held in the 
Women’s Gym every Tuesday and 
Thursday at 4:30, and expert sight­
ing instruction is being given. As
soon as the range is. finished, which 
will probably be sometime this week, 
practice shooting will be started. 
Every practice should be considered 
a match to obtain the test re­
sults. Each shot should be a pcrfect 
one or. as nearly a ten as you can 
possible make it. Haphazard methods 
of practice will not prepare any one 
to shoot in the telegraphic matchca 
with otlie.- colleges.
Hockey
The hockey game between the 
plebe and sophomore teams, which 
was postponed last Friday by Man­
ager Alice Thompson, will be played 
Tuesday, November 17, at 4:30 on 
the Cut. The play-off depends, oi 
course, on' the weather. Freshmen 
and sophomores arc asked to watch 
the bulletin boards for announce­
ments.
The sophomore team is composed 
of: Ritzcl, Rose, McKelvey, Landis, 
Thompson, ICrepps, Gough, Jackson, 
Ross, and Ripley. Those on the 
freshman team are: Spuhler, Wcl- 
fer, V. Linn, Bower, Galata, Had­
dock, Conti, Cooper, . Dcmms, M 
Griffin, Libbey, Lowry, Sickcnbcr* 
ger, M. Warner and Borie. i 
W. A. A. Party
The annual fall W. A. A. party 
was held in the “Rcc” Hall last 
Thursday, November 12. The com­
mittee in charge was’: Genevieve
Rose, Chairman; Jean Ritzcl, Betty 
Prcllcr, and Hazel Gough. The pur­
pose of this was to better acquainj 
the freshmen girls with other girls 
in school and to better acquaint 
them with the ideals of the Women’s 
Athletic Association, one of which 
is “play for play’s sake.”
After some peppy get-together 
games and a little dancing a supper 
wris served by the committee at six 
o’clock. When all were finished eat­
ing, the W. A. A. Board was intro­
duced to the group. Dean, Green 
then spokp of few jyords of welcome 
to the girls. The awards were pre­
sented by the president of the asso­
ciation. W. A. A. pins were given to 
Betty Prcller and Gloria Kloos, and 
numerals were awarded to Aline 
Ross, Dolly Allison, Gene Rose, Jean 
Ritzcl, Lois Jacobs, Betty Cooper,

Kulas was the third Carnegie man, 
with Hoffman and Neff following.
After the meet, the plebcs were 
¦shown around the school grounds 
and then led away to dinner. 
Everyone pronounced the day a 
success and then back to the 
grind.

Night College Of 
Industries Hold 
Successful Smoker
The Smoker held October 31 by 
the Night College of Industries was 
another demonstration of the very 
excellent manner in which this col­
lege can conduct its parties. Every­
thing that was possible to do was 
done to satisfy the several hun­
dred night students who sought 
entertainment at the ‘first semester 
affair.
Upon entering the gymnasium the 
student's ticket was torn in half 
so that a door prize drawing could 
be held later on. in the evening. 
He then walked past a long table 
where he was presented with novel­
ties, cigarettes, cigars, matches, etc., 
after which lie passed on to his 
scat.
The show began with several 
interesting silent movies, all of 
which were of the comedy style 
and provoked no end of mirth, 
which indicated that those present 
enjoyed the selections, as W’as evi­
dent by the large volume of noise 
produced on the noiscmakers.
Following the movies, the college 
went into the election of officers to 
represent the Night College of In­
dustries on the Night Student Coun­
cil, and as a result of this election 
John F. Simpson was made presi­
dent; Chester S. Biscup, vice presi­
dent; Sebastian W. Phillippi, secre­
tary, and Charles Bldchinger, treas­
urer.
The drawing for the door prizes 
gave the first prize to. T. T. Lutes, 
third year Mechanical Drafting; 
second prize to" E. Vvrostck, acc- 
ond year Automobile Maintenance 
and Operation, and third prize to 
L. Ii. Braun, first year General 
Studies.
At this point preparations were 
made for the all-important'boxing 
bouts and wrestling matches. The 
bouts w'ere some of the best ever 
given at any of the smokers, par­
ticularly the comedy bout, and this 
went over in a big- way. Our own 
Jimmie Geyser and Pete Verlinich 
again showed their ability in the 
wrestling field.
At the conclusion of the_ fistic 
demonstrations, the festivities 
changeef to the all-important feature 
of eating, and there was one grand 
charge for the serving counters. 
Abundance of everything was on 
hand to ^crvc these present and 
nobody left without being well fed.
The s'mbker 'would* not be, com­
plete if we did not have our famous 
Carnegie Kiltie Band on hand, 
which they w’erc, and they were 
generous -beyond all expectations 
with'their numbers. It was thrill­
ing to hear those bandsters play. 
The Night College of Industries 
certainly docs appreciate havingihis 
'wonderful school organization play, 
for them and arc thankful for the 
way the band turns out for the 
smokers.
Like all things there had to be 
an end and 12 o’clock came all 
too soon for t'he termination of 
the smoker. The enthusiasm and 
spirit which w'ent into-the making 
of success for this smoker was 
wonderful and everyone who at­
tended the affair says that as long 
as they are attending Carnegie they 
will not miss any.
Smoking By Night Students Not Permitted 
In Margaret Morrison
The attention of night stu­
dents scheduled in the Mar­
garet Morrison Building is 
called to the fact that smoking 
is not permitted in that build­
ing. Students arc requested to 
conform with this regulation.

to reach the floor above. I never 
know whether I am oji the ¦ first

say is that we would like to take a

that the' engineers lost a gallon of

That is indeed a picklcmcnt the 
engineers arc in—Wonder xvhere those 
pickles can be. Oh where, or where 
has my gallon of pickcls gone. Has 
anybody seen pickets? He is so tall, 
so broad, and so thick; had a yellow 
overcoat on when last seen on Octo­
ber 24, the night he disappeared, and 
answers to the name of siOcct. Any­
one who can supply information as 
to the ivHereabouts of this elusive 
picketed, gallon of cucumbcrs will be 
awarded subsequently. Hope they find 
Ihc pickles.
. That holiday came in just fine for 
mv state of mind. I had so many 
things to do and so much time -to 
do them in that I hardly knew when 
ihc night was up and I had to get 
ready for the next night session in 
Machinery Hall.' We arc ccrtainly 
¡making good progress on the campus. 
Here we, arc running along at a 
great space and it will soon be time 
for a quiz—you had. one—well isn’t 
that' nize. Good luck old boy. Even 
though the notice was published about 
• no classes on November 11, I saw a 
number going to night school, they 
¡have the ¦ habit so. No 1 didn't go, 
but I saw some who did.
Wish some body would buy me a 
blanket. I could use one iwalking 
across the '“Cut” on those windy 
days (I mean nights) when the wind 
is blowing 6o miles strong. But why 
should they? I am ojily an idle night 
student and then they, don’t give 
. things to idle people. However, I 
am glad 1q note that somebody did, 
think the band was worthy of con­
sideration and secured blankets for 
'iliis energcctic outfit of musicians. 
!They sure can blow the tunes. Those 
5night Industries men arc very 
'thoughtful t>- remember, the band in 
such a big way. Blankets for all and 
&// for blankets in the band.
Well, there you are. I thought it 
would come to that. I was sure that 
smoking was not permitted in Mar­
garet Morrispn College and was sur­
prised that they didn’t say some­
thing about it before this. Sure is 
¡too bad that we smokers couldn’t 
¡refrain at least an hour or so ¿from 
puffing on the old weed—or we 
couldn’t wait until we were out of 
the building to take a .puff. Although 
I was tempted to smoke on many 
occasions in my class in this building 
this year, I managed to hold up 
until I was outside before I lit my 
fag. Let’s hope that all those who 
¡have classes in Margaret Morrison 
will observe the “No Smoking” rule 
in force in the building and refrain 
from doing so. Let us remember that 
we have been given the opportunity 
of attending classes, in this building 
and that the least we can do is to 
abide by the rijlcs that are laid down 
for the benefit of all. We, I hope, 
arc sorry that our attention was 
called to the oversight, and promise 
not to sin again. Agreed, yes. Then 
let’s make amends.
I am glad that we will; have an­
other chance at a holiday during this 
month. It comes the day after 
Thanksgiving and is known as 
Thanksgiving Recess. That leads me 
to the question of the Thanksgiving 
Recess Dance. Did you ever attend 
any of these affairs? If you haven’t 
you belter make plans to attend. I 
am anxious to see what the Plaid 
has to say about the coming event 
and will comment upon the party in 
the next. Meanwhile take a tip from 
thk Idle Night Student and make 
your date right now, because if you 
don’t it will be too late and- you 
will regret not attending.
Well the parking situation,on the 
night campus is improving as rapidly 
backward as i£ possible. The 'trouble 
.is that there is too much space for 
all . the cars and not sufficient cars 
to fill the space so what can be ex­
pected except that some of- us will 
be tagged and you know the conse­
quences. I have done my downmost 
to uplift the situation and I thought 
-I Jiad things well in hand until the 
otnet evening I saw a car of an old 
vintage, parked iri' the place where 
no parking is allowed aiid it didn’t 
even, have a tag. Perhaps the car be­
longs to—well you know. I am still 
hoping that my suggestion of a park­
ing tunnel will take root and that 
before long spmeone will blossom 
forth with a plan for congregating 
the much maligned heat busses..
It’s hard to realize it but the fact 
is that the International is still going 
strong and that wilder and wilder 
paintings arc made every year. The 
Costume in Suicide ccrtainly is ahum 
dinger of a blah and I don't mean 
maybe. If you 'don’t believe me, ask 
someone who can’t tell. The zifondcr

T-hcrc will be an election of faeu'ty 
advisors and the social affairs for 
the year will be discussed.
WHO PAYS FOR 
COLLEGE DATES?
All is quiet on the western col­
lege front; both sides have revert­
ed to "passive resistance." An im­
portant question is at stake, "Wlic 
pays for the dates?" “It is the 
woman who pays and pays," says 
fanciful tradition.
"Fifty-fifty, meekly wdiispcr the 
oppressed male sex. We must 
never permit these carbon copies 
of an Amazon revolt against the 
will of man. Our sacred rights 
must be respected. The depres­
sion is on, and wrc have come to 
the end of our resources. The 
pater refuses to foot the bills for 
your gin and cigarctcs. Leapin’ 
Lena has given up the ghost, and 
junk yards arc so hard hit by the 
depression that they -have gone 
under. We can’t give you any­
thing but love and I. O. U. for 
half of the bill. Accept our terms 
or suffer the consequences.
Nothing doing, sweetly chime 
the bold college maidens with an 
air of nonchalance, but sccrctly 
hoping that the enemy will sur­
render their "Arms.” Doesn't Foot­
ball player earn money winding 
an eight-day clock, and doesn't 
Jimmy Bookworm get paid for 
reading tea leaves. at the Egyptian 
Inn? If you do not withdraw 
your absurd demands immediately 
we will order a "Boycaught.” 
(Out'sidc of school* for each of 
us.)
What a strange war, muses the 
night student after it is all over 
and both sides "take to arms."
Well, you may breathe freely 
now because we * night students 
will never be drawn into this bat­
tle. No fifty-fifty club for us. We 
have an extensive social calendar 
but the price of a date to one of 
our affairs is so trivial that no 
self-respecting male will impose 
upon the girl-friend to pay half 
of the bill, when Jic knows that a 
fine evening of pleasure and en­
tertainment, excellent music and 
delightful refreshments is in store 
for him.

A Night Student’s 
Impression Of The 
Art International
The current International Art 
Exhibition has aroused such furor 
in the Art world that it has caus­
ed the average person to rise from 
his usual state of lethargy and be­
stir himself enough to find out 
what it’s all about. I, being an 
average person,v decided that some­
thing must be putrid in Denmark 
and I must wend my way to the 
galleries and find out what the 
¡cause of all this storm could be.
' I recall reading somewhere that 
Art is the medium of expression for 
one’s physical and mental reactions. 
With this thought in mind, I, was 
going’ to view the exhibition and 
try not to allow the criticism and 
judgment of others to effect inc.
My self-conducted tour began 
in the United States gallery, where 
Scyffcrt’s life-size painting of "Sid­
ney Franklin, the Bull Fighter," 
seems to have many admirers. 
While looking at this painting I 
noticcd two timid foreigners study­
ing it with almost professional interest 
when suddenly one of them—a lit­
tle man with a grey mustache— 
turned to his comrade, his eyes 
glowing with the light of complete 
understanding, and whispered: “Oh, 
that’s George Washington." Par- 
ccll’s "Nude." fascinates me as do 
Boardman Robinson’s "Composi­
tion of Figures" which arc typi­
cal of his murals at Kaufmann’s. 
“July,” by our own Mr. McGil- 
vary, lias many admirers. It’s ex-
dents who have never attended 
one of the affairs—take in the first 
dance on our social calendar and 
I’ll bet you look forward to the 
next one with joyful expectancy. E.
cellent composition and color pre­
sented in his own interesting style 
arc some of the reasons why it 
seems to dominate this gallery. 
The “Kentucky Derby," an instant 
impression of an exciting moment 
at the racc gets a passing glance.
“Summer School,” in one of the 
galleries, recalls to my mind a 
newspaper interview with Marie 
Bard, the Red Cross poster girl, 
when asked if she had ever fallen 
in love with an artist, replied: 
"Goodness, no, they’re all too fun* 
ny looking.” Judging from this 
picture there isn’t any hope for ro­
mantically inclined artists as yet. 
"Steel, Steam and Speed," by Pro­
fessor Warner, brings me to an 
abrupt halt. The realism with 
which the train seems to bear 
down upon you is almost terrify­
ing and I unconsciously step aside 
from apparent danger. Those dis­
tortions did the trick.
And now comes that greatly dis­
cussed prize winner, about which 
Mr. Cortissoz expressed the hope 
that its painter was. a young man 
so that lie may have time to live 
it down and to which I add a fer­
vent amen. What strange colors
—that left leg—where docs it be­
long—the poor wretch must have 
been blowing the horn through the 
wrong end before it dropped from 
his distorted mouth. I give up. 
With the thought that since every­
body has a name for it I might as 
well call it something, so to me 
it’s a "Chromatic Monstrosity,” a 
monstrosity in color—that’s my
first impression and I’ll stick to it 
and let the storm rage merrily on. 
How terrible this painting is in 
comparison to Spcicher’s "Bab-
bett," which in my opinion should
have been awarded the prize.

Thanksgiving Recess 
Dance Plans Rapidly 
• Nearing Completion
Committee Hints Surprises for Those Attending First Social Function'
Plans for the Thanksgiving Recess 
Dance arc well under way and the 
committee is working hard to make 
this affair more successful than those 
of the past. This committee'is very 
reticent to divulge the plans but 
hints that the students arc in for 
surprises.
Several well known orchestras are 
under consideration, but no choice 
has as yet been made. There is ho 
doubt, however, that the one’ chosen 
will give those who attend the dance 
a brand of foot tingling strains that 
will be hard to resist.
Several salesmen have been ap­
pointed in each of the three colleges 
to handle the ticket sales, so be sure 
to see one of them for yours. The 
admission pricc is the same as last 
year—one'dollar. It is doubted if the 
enjoyment derived from this small 
investment can be duplicated any­
where at any price, so don’t forget— 
The date—November 27 
The placc—Men’s Gym 
The pricc—$1 per couple
NIGHT ARTS SOCIAL 
CHAIRMAN APPOINTED
J. Paul Stevens has been appointed 
to serve as Social Chairman of the 
Night College of Fine Arts, by Presi­
dent H. E. Mauro, for the present 
school year. Mr.- Stevens is regis­
tered in the P. and D. department 
and is a member of Nu‘ Sigma 
Alpha honorary fraternity.
Mr. Stevens is well qualified for 
this important position as he is 
thoroughly familiar with the social 
affairs of the night school. Plans 
arc already under awy for the first 
Arts dance to be held early in De­
cember and new social chairman has 
outlined a scheme that will make 
this affair one of the most novel 
dances ever held by the Arts school.
S.
Dance Tickets Have 
Been Mailed To 
Workers of Council
Tickets for the Thanksgiving Re­
cess Dance have* been mailed out to 
those workers who have volunteered 
to work for the Council and who 
have sent in their names. If those 
students havfc not •' received their 
tickets by this time they should get 
in touch with the Night Student 
Council by addressing a note to the 
Council marked for Box 137, and 
placing the note in the slot marked 
Inter-School Mail at 1 the Campus 
Post Office.
Perhaps some of the names and 
addresses arc not correct, on the 
mailing list, so a request is made 
that any student receiving a letter 
incorrectly, addressed is requested to 
get in touch with the /Council.
ART STUDENT CRASHES 
INDUSTRIES SMOKER
Smoker a Howling Success, But Artfc Dance is Preferred
How I succccdcd in getting past 
the vigilant door guards of the 
Industries Smoker , would baffle a 
Scotland Yard detective; yes. even 
an engineer couldn’t solve the mys­
tery. However, that's my story and 
secret—I got in and was ready to 
enjoy myself so that’s that.
Here I am in the. barn-like gym 
with hundreds of men all over the 
placc making so much noise that 
one had to shout to be heard. 
Smoke from the numberless cigars, 
cigarcttes and pipes hung from the 
roof like a pale blue cloud. A 
colorless affair as compared to one 
of our Art’s dances, but they ccr­
tainly made up for it in the en­
thusiasm. Over in one corner the 
Kiltie Band reigned supreme and 
after every musical number the ap­
plause was terrific.-
Finally the crowd seated them­
selves and a, darkened hall be­
tokened that movies w'crc about to 
be shown—not good, not bad, so 
so. The high spot of the evening 
in the way of entertainment W'as 
the comedy wrestling bout between 
two mammoth heavyweights that 
delighted in torturing each other. 
That’s OK with me, boys, go to 
it. This was followed by several 
boxing1 bouts that were fairly good. 
One of them was a comedy affair 
put on by Sailor Popcyc and his 
pugilistic enemy. This bout brought 
down the house. Of course they 
had the election of officers, but I 
am not‘interested, so let’s go to the 
next point.
Suddenly there wras a rush to the 
'rear of the hall, all as one, like 
an uncontrollable fury they moved, 
sweeping all before them; what 
could it mean? Like a helpless 
boat on a stormy sea, I was car­
ried along, ah cl I suddenly saw 
the reason for this apparent riot. 
It was a bombardment of balloons 
being lowered from the sky, and 
did they explode, well I guess. 
Not satisfied with this devasta­
tion the crowd raided the lunch 
tables. Food was served, and how 
those boys could cat. Box after 
box disappeared as if by magic, 
and still they kept on coming. 
Some got second ' and third help­
ings; there seemed to be no end 
to this mad clamoring, but finally 
evei\ the most ravenous became 
satisfied. Then little by little the 
crowd began to thin out and the 
smoker, became history, and like its 
many predecessors,’ a howling suc­
cess. Those Industries boys ccr­
tainly know how to put on a 
smoker, but give me an Art’s dance 
where gaiety and color intermingled 
.'with laughter and music means 
more than eating, smoking, cheer­
ing and boxing. Anyhow, thanks 
boys, I had a great time and I’ll 
sec you at the next smoker, if I 
can get in.

The rushing of the second se- 
mr.rtl.cr registrants shall begin with 
the second week after the mid-

NEW GROUP HAS 
FIRST ELECTION
Joseph Weiler Will Head 
New Short-Coursc 
Association
On November 10, these officers 
for the Short-Coursc Student Asso­
ciation were elected from the short 
course siucjent body: President, Jo­
seph Weiler; vice president, Harvey 
Smith; secretary, Ernest Pricc; treas­
urer, Hugh Fischer. Mr. Weiler and 
Mr. Smith are short-course students 
in the Department of Printing,, Mr. 
Pricc in the Department of Heating 
and Ventilating, and Mr. Fincher in 
.the Department of Building Con­
struction. Dr. Jewett, djrcctor of the 
College of Industries, a sponsor of 
the new organization, addressed the 
students, lie described the oppor­
tunities presented in the short course 
program of studies.
The new organization will function 
as ¡i governmental body for the 
short-course students in the' same 
manner as the day Student Council 
acts for the dcgrcc-coursc student 
body. It was formed in order that 
the short-coursc students might have 
organized representatives to sponsor 
their activities, since they arc neither 
given representation in the day Stu­
dent Council nor allowed to partici­
pate in the regular day school activi­
ties. The new body will be directly 
responsible to the day Student Coun­
cil.
The short-coursc is open to high 
school graduates, and differs from 
the regular four year courses in that 
it lasts only two years, is made up 
of practically all technical work, and 
leads to a certificate. The short- 
coursc is offered in the industrial 
field only.
PRINTING DEPT.
TO HOLD EXHIBIT
The exhibition known as "Fifty 
Books of; the Year”' will be shown 
in the small exhibition room of 
the College of Fine Arts, Novem­
ber 16-30. The books on exhibi­
tion were selected from about 700 
entries by a jury appointed by 
the American Institute of Graphic 
Arts,' which consisted of Will 
Bradley, Theodore Brown Hap- 
good and Laurence Gonimc.
The choices ,were ibascd upon 
the typographical design, prcsswork 
and binding of the volumes, and 
the books included in the collec­
tion constitute fair samples of the 
best American book printing of 
today. The exhibition is being 
held under the auspices of the 
American Institute of Graphic Arts 
and the Department of Printing 
of Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy, and will be open to the gen­
eral public daily, except Sundays 
and holidays, from 10 a. in. to 10 
p. m. A public lecture will prob­
ably be given in connection with 
the exhibition on Monday evening, 
November 23.
The exhibit "Printing for Com­
merce," will be .shown with the

Westinghouse To 
Illumine Monument
LECTURE SERIES 
BEGINS SUNDAY
Washington Monument to 
Giiide Aviation
Lieutenant 'Colonel U. S. Grant, 
3rd, Director of Public Buildings and 
Public Parks, announces that after 
months of studies, tests and demon­
strations, ,a satisfactory lighting plan 
for the Washington Monument has 
been worked out and a contract for 
the lighting equipment awarded to 
the Westinghouse Electric and Manu­
facturing Company.
According to Colonel Grant, the. 
Monument is not to be lighted as a 
beacon but rather to be illuminated' 
so . as to - increase its visibility and 
eliminate the hazard it offers td 
aviators'. Difficulties of the plan 
ar’ose from the determination that it 
should 1 remain subordinate to the 
Capitol and that it should not com­
pete with" the Lincoln Memorial, 
wftich is mysteriously illuminated at 
night only by the road lights around 
it. Also it must not have, the ap­
pearance of a round shaft.
This requirement has been met in 
the arrangement of lights and by 
throwing more light 011 the north 
and south sides of the monument 
than 011 the east and west sides. 
This will also make the outlines pf 
the slender memorial visible from 
a greater distance than if all sides 
had equal illuminatioh, according, to 
Wcstinghouse engineers.
The Washington National - Monu­
ment Society was formed in 1833, 
construction on the monument was 
started in 1848 but was abandoned
from 1855 to 1877. It was finally 
completed in 1884 at a cost of $1,- 
300,000. Congress has appropriated« 
$15,000 to cover the lighting contract.
Illuminating "each side will be three 
d o odl i g h t s, employing 1,500-watt 
lamps and set '10 feet from the
Monument, also two floodlights with 
1,000-watt lamps, similarly placed. 
Two searchlights fitted with 2,000- 
watt projection lamps will illuminate 
the tip of the Monument. One of 
these will be placed on th6 Navy
Building, the other on the Auditor’s 
Building.
Floodlights will be housed in metal 
cases congenial with the design of
the obelisk. Only two of the 1,500- 
wall lamps will be used in clear 
weather, others being held in re­
serve for foggy or nniify conditions. 
Strength of the lighting on the dif­
ferent sides will be controlled by 
regulating the voltage of the several 
lamps.

Raphail Atlas, whtfse home is in 
Tel Aviv, Palestine, is studying, as 
a sophomore, Aeronautical Engin­
eering. He came to Carnegie 
through the recommendation of hife 
brother who graduated from the 
College of Engineering in 1928. Be­
fore he came here, ;Mr. Atlas was 
graduated from a school corre­
sponding to our high school except 
that it has a much higher standing 
in that the work is more advanced. 
In the three years before his com­
ing to1 America lie studied archi­
tecture, worked as a surveyor’s 
assistant, and helped in editing text 
books on military rifles -and 'pistols, 
in which the greater part of the 
work consisted of the translating 
from European languages into He­
brew and in creating an exacting 
terminology.. He also labored 
among' the Bedouins on an orange 
plantation in Arabia.
After he has been graduated from 
Carnegie, lie expects to attend the 
Guggenheim School of Aviation to 
get his A. E. degree. Upon com­
pletion of that course his intentions 
are to return to the Near East and 
engage in some form of aviation 
either in Palestine where everyone 
is working toward the reconstruc­
tion of the country, or in Arabia, 
where an air force is being estab­
lished.

American-born parents who now

Mr. Crosby is registered as a junior

course given '"here, lie was influ­
enced to come by two uncles, both 
of whom were graduated from Car­
negie. Since he attended private 
schools .in this' country before en­
tering Tech, there has been no 
strangeness in the experience of, at­
tending an American college.
After .he .has/1 completed his course 
here, he intends to return to the 
Philippines to take a position in a 
company which manufactures ma­
chinery-and mill supplies where his 
father is now employed as a com­
mercial engineer.

enrolled in the Department of 
Printing in the College of Indus­

Mexico. Since his father,' who was 
born *in Germany, is a dealer in

naturally interested in printing. Be­
cause of the excellent reputation of 
the Department of Printing, he en­
tered Carnegie. He carried on his

ALUMNI NEWS
Owen D. Young Urges Colleges
To Aid Relief Resource Drive
Suggestion Made That Receipts From One Football 
Game Bfe Given to Unemployment 
Relief Fund
The ‘following open letter has been ad­
dressed to the alumni and undergraduates 
of nil tho colleges in the United States. 
Its author, Owen D. Young, is one of the 
outstanding members of President Hoovcr’6 
Committee on Mobilization of Relief Re­
sources.
On October 14 in the capacity of 
•chairman of the Committee on Mo­
bilization of Relief Resources to 
which I have been summoned by 
the President's-Organization on Un- 
• employment Relief, I issued a call 
to all colleges and schools in the 
United States having football teams 
to give to unemployment relief the 
gross receipts, less actual expenses, 
of. one game. . I asked that, if the 
proceeds of a regular game could 
not be devoted to this purpose, or 
a substantial percentage of the re­
ceipts of one or more games, that 
extra or special games be sched­
uled to raise these funds. _I did 
this because I believe it is an ex­
cellent thing for the students of 
our colleges and schools to recog­
nize the situation whiph the Presi­
dent has characterized as a National 
emergency, and to have a- part, 
with the rest of us,, in meeting it..
The response to this call ^ has 
splendidly justified my'expectations; 
One hundred and. ten. colleges have- 
completed 'or are completing ar­
rangements for special games.. 
Eighteen others have pledged them­
selves to give all or part of the 
iiet proceeds of regular games. The 
list, we know, will be-substantially 
increased before the football sea­
son is dyer.
E. K. Hall, of Hanover, chairman 
of the Rules Committee of the Na­
tional Collegiate Football Associa­
tion, who has taken over, at my 
request, direction of this project, 
very truly, points out that "the re­
sponse of the members of the foot­
ball teams, most of which have 
already played through long, hard 
schedules, has been 100 per cent. 
Those • responsible for the admin­
istration of the schools and colleges 
have done their part; and not with­
out difficulty.”
One very important aspect of the 
undertaking remains, to be con­
sidered, and considered _ with the:
same fine, hearty- enthusiasm .with
ÌV
which the other details have been 
taken up.
We must have'spectators as well 
as pla3rcrs at these games. It is as 
spectators that the overwhelming 
majority of, the students will have 
their part in achieving the purpose 
for which these games wjll be 
played. My call was issued to all 
students, not merely to the mem­
bers of the football squads alone. 
It is to the spectators that the 
unemployed must look for the as­
sistance to which they are so well 
^entitled.
Frtfm every point of view these 
games should be the1 most largely 
attended that have ever been played 
in ‘ this country. They will be 
marked by spectacular football., I 
am told,' indeed, that it will be 
football beyond that which marked 
the regular schedules. In the num­
ber and the spirit . of the people 
who attend them they ought to be 
great demonstrations of our deter­
mination to meet the emergency. 
The register of the turnstiles ought 
to run into, the millions.
In my call I asked the senior 
classes of the colleges and, schools 
to organize the students for at­
tendance at the games. Through 
this message I am renewing this 
call, as the time for the games 
draws near. The response of the 
students should be unanimous, and 
I call on them to riiake it so. They 
should begin now- their missionary 
¡work a,mong their families and 
their friends.
I call, too, on the alumni to at­
tend. I should like to know that 
as clubs and . associations and indi­
viduals they will give every possible 
support. They have been having 
their part in mcpting the emer­
gency/in other ways, and this is 
not at all to take the place of that 
participation. It is to be some­
thing over and above what they 
have already done or may have 
planned to do. We hgive need of 
every .aid that can be rendered.
Through .Carnegie Tartan I call 
upon the present and former stu­
dents of Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology ,t6- .make, her contribution 
'worthy of her ‘••.•'diiions.

Cinema Theater Is
Featuring German Art
The movement to further the ex­
pression of German art has received 
definite impetus from a group of 
theater managers, who have de­
termined to treat their audiences with 
consistently artistic filnis—and make 
it pa3r. The movement, starting in 
New York, has now spread over 
the country, and Pittsburgh has a 
representative of the "new” theater 
in the Cinema.
Although being a different type of 
entertainment entirely from the pic­
tures now in vogue, it presents a 
type of genuine art that is almost 
unique in its field. The films arc in 
German dialogue, but ' tlid disad­
vantage is almost negligible, as the 
copious notes and fine acting offset

for “turkey and,” or making a trip to the big game.
Go by Greyhound bus. It’s most comfortable—(Tropic-Aire

hours, and of course it costs less. Serves more cities than 
any other travel system, too! Ask your campus representative

If inquiry went deeper, it would reveal that Camels

That’s important, because in handling fine to­

sacrifice freshness and flavor too.
Camel smokers needn’t worry about that, because 
Camels are blended of fine Turkish and mild Domestic

Applause for the Kilties
Notable with the recent comments of Pittsburgh sports 
writers praising Carnegie’s fighting football team is an attribute paid to Carnegie’s famous Kiltie »Band after the 
Notre Dame-Carnegie football game. One of the Pittsburgh 
Press scribes wrote:"The Tech band never plays better than when its team 
needs encouragement in defeat. The musicians, with a 
flurry of kilts and tartan, and a flash of white gaiter, moved 
briskly out to the center of the field and formed a shamrock.“When the whistle had blown on Tech’s defeat and the 
score still stood 19-0, Tech’s band marched down DeSota 
street, which was solid with people from the main gateway 
of the Stadium to Fifth avenue.“The lads in the band had their heads up and their 
shoulders back, and marched as fast as th6 crowd would let them. Their music sounded like anything but a dirge 
of defeat. It had rollicking air of tribute to men who have 
fought a good battle."The letter formations this year have been exceptionally 
good and are evidence that the band members and managers 
have spent maify hours in rehearsing and drilling. The Kiltie Band members, managers, and Director Sullivan are 
deserving of a great deal of credit for their contribution to 
the spirit of the football games in the Stadium this year.J. L.

Student Opinion on Disarmament
Reproduced below in this column is a sample ballot 
which is being used by the Intercollegiate Disarmament Council in taking a student poll at the various colleges 
throughout the country. The purpose of the ballot being to 
secure the reactions of the'students of today to the world 
problems of national defense and disarmament.
The Intercollegiate Disarmament Council consists of 
college graduates and student leaders throughout the coun­try who wish to crystallize the effect of student opinion 
aiding world peace, and particularly to work for the suc­cess of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. This confer­
ence of the world powers will be held early in February 
of next year and should generally ascertain the future of 
disarmament programs.’In presenting this questionnaire to the students of Car­
negie, the Tartan does not take any definite stand either in favor of or opposed to the general trend of the questions. 
Rather than attempt to influence the judgment of the stu­
dents on these policies, it will be interesting to find out if the various types of students at Carnegie have maintained 
contact with world events through individual initiative, and are prepared to render an opinion.
It is quite desirable that the response to the straw 
ballot being taken, shall be sufficiently large to be a cor­
rect analysis of opinion on this campus. Also a demonstra­tion of interest in politic affairs will be encouraging in re­
futing the arguments of the several writers of today.who analyze the college students mind as being incapable of any 
intellectual attainment bevond the scope of gossip.
K.
Mark this ballot completely, tear out, and post in a Tartan mailbox in 
the school halls.

couple of the honorary officers when he comes to 
present their commissions . . . Jim Williams skids 
into position when called Scabbard and Blade . . . 
Some of the pledges mess up on the signals and 
salute at the wrong time . . . The Scabbard and 
Blade actives, chiefly Jack Horning, trying to 
suppress giggles during the ceremony ... A saber 
missing after the ceremony . .- . On with the

Several Naaavy men. An Army gray. Tech’s boots

Lost, One Umbrella—
One murky day in the not so distant past Betty 
Cooper and Dolly 1 Allison stood on a Swiss vale 
street corner waiting for a street car (believe it
or not). A nice looking chap insleek car of­
fered to drive 
them to school. 
P romptly "de­
livered at Mag­
gie Murph the 
girls thanked 
their host and 
he wended his 
way to his 
school on yon 
side of Fifth 
Avenue. As soon as the car had disappeared in 
a cloud of dust Betty bcthot herself of her um­
brella which she had left in the car. A liberal re­
ward is offered for information leading to a dis­
closure of the identity of the kind Pitt chap . . . * * * *
An Economic Measure—
The TX boys have been trying to cut down on 
expenses by keeping excess lights extinguished, 
especially during open houses when lights arc a 
nuisance anyhow. Sammy Bowers and date were 
easing out of a room as Ray Knopf and same were 
moving in. In order to do right Sam scz Miss 
Karol, Miss Soandso and Mr. Knopf. After chat­
ting a bit Sam thinks his date is unusually quiet'so 
reaches, for her but cannot locate her. Finally a 
search revealed her in the next room where she 
had been since before the introduction.* * * *
Around Machinery Hall—
Considerable speculation has been made as to 
the purpose of the fancy new masonry project at 
the side of Machinery Hall. It really is just a 
glorified junk yard and coal bin. No doubt the 
brain child of some dreamy architect. Just think, 
all the brick put into that junk yard wall could 
have made a very presentable library to re­
place the Horrible Hut . . . During the history of 
Carnegie Tech several small boys have fallen into 
the small reservoir' beside the coal bin and have
drowned. Still the school has never covered the 
hazard to eliminate the danger . . . That cylin­
drical tank behind the Industries Building was 
used to'test ship propellors in the hectic days of 
the War ... A hand grenade court was situated 
in the ravine beside Machinery Hall . . . Army 
Tanks practiced running up and down the un­
finished terraces of the Quadrangle . . . Until the 
light was installed in the doorway of Machinery 
Hall several years ago the steps were a popular 
dating rendezvous . . .* * * *
Common People’s Dance—
Not much of a crowd at the Temple Football 
Dance. Nearly all available women at the Army 
Ball . . . Mrs. Patterson as the very charming 
chaperone . . . Jerry McGeorge’s Gang doing well 
again . . . "Good Night, Sweetheart,” the nation’s 
favorite, and from England at that . . . Half a 
dozen P. C. W. girls present and acouunted for 
... A Tech pupil of the Pitt hypnotist practicing 
the art . . . Four Army Kaydcts wonder in. 
Several girls remark, “They’re not so hot” . . . 
Ginny Artz tagged by an Army Man . . . Tank 
Highbcrgcr strutting his stuff . . .

What Next?—
A Senior with any eye for business spied a large 
fan with ten blades in the Mechanical Lab. With 
a piece of chalk he numbered the blades and 
marked an arrow on the framework. The next 
step was to sell ten 10-cent chances on a dollar. 
Then a neutral party spun the fan and the crowd 
strained forward to sec the winning number. 
Number two is the lucky number! The winner 
collected his ill gotten gains and most of the 
crowd returned to :thcir experiments. One curious 
fellow remained ancj. tried spinning the fan some 
more. It stopped at two five times in succession! 
. . . Mellon and Laurel Halls, are real snooty and 
have special alternating current lines piped in 
’specially for 
their radios.
That’s nothing 
tho, Kinley and 
Kolb found a 
real wireless (it 
has no outside 
wires) w h i c h 
they use in 
their design 
room and the 
Tartan office . . . Not so long ago, after checking 
upon their scads of trophies the Dclts discovered 
that their precious sweepstakes cup was absent 
and unaccounted for. A week later it was returned 
by mail. Some fraternity must have needed deco­
rations for a party . . . Two dances next week 
end, the Freshman Dance and a Blanket Dance. It 
seems that the Blanket Dance is a testimonial 
affair for the graduating members of the football 
team where they arc presented with blankets for 
souvenirs instead of the traditional sweaters. No 
doubt they get sweaters too, but the blankets are 
an "extra something” . . .

Celebrating the Armistice
Last Wednesday was the thirteenth anniversary of the declaration of peace after four years of world warfare. We 
should be able from the distance to look back) upon that 
havoc with more or less unbiased attitudes. Most of the 
war propaganda has been forgotten and our hatred for the “enemy” has cooled. We can now recognize facts as facts.
Self preservation is the primary law of nature. It is 
the duty of man to protect himself against annihilation, and, 
thus far, he has survived the numerous onslaughts of his 
self-manufactured menace—the greatest menace man will ever encounter—war!
War has, since the, beginning, been unquestioned in its function of self preservation. All major disputes involving 
the security of one tribe as opposed to that of another tribe, of one state to that of a rival state, of one nation to that of 
one or more nations—all have been “settled” by war. And 
who has been the victor in each case? The distress of the 
so-called conqueror has always been equal to that of the 
conquered. A little glory, perhaps; an extra line in the his­
tory book—but there is nothing permanent in glory or 
renown. The pulse of the tribe, state, or nation which has experienced war, inevitably retards in both momentum and 
force, and the effect is as lasting as was the intensity of the war.
The law of nature concerning self preservation does not specify by what means man shall preserve himself. What 
clause says that war is the only defense—what suggests 
that man defend his life with sword in one hand and hand grenades in the other, while air, land, and water vehicles 
convey him toward his neighbors’ destruction, all under a 
placard labeled “Self-Defense?” What is there in the wprds 
‘self preservation” to reject the possibility of arbitration as the means to this end? Only in the very recent past has 
man paused long enough to arbitrate, but this same recent 
past has introduced into warfare, through science, such 
weapons as promise to destroy continents at a time, should war break out again.
After nearly fifteen long, financially declining years, the 
world is still suffering, and, incidentally, paying, for a war to end war; the world is in a slump, and even now the 
specter is again threatening in more than one corner of the 
globe. Chjna and Japan are showing their fangs; France 
and Germany, with the United States and England as all 
too,interested onlookers, are growling behind.their “peace­
ful countenances; South American is always simmering 
somewhere, and the rest of the nations have not entirely laid aside their grudges of fifteen years’ duration. The crisis 
ot the ages—both past and future, has made its presence 
known, and if man will only lay aside sentimentalism, ignor­ance. and greed, then indeed will he obey the natural law of 
self preservation, and at the same time, verily live to “in­herit the earth.”^ ’ ^

One Per Cent of Student Body 
at Chapel
Out of the 2,477 students who 
are enrolled at Carnegie, approxi­
mately 25 of these attend chapel 
services. Every other Tuesday 
this tiny fraction of the student 
body spends 35 minutes listening 
to one of the better-known preach­
ers of Pittsburgh and joining in 
the singing of several h}-mns. 
Every other Tuesday 1 per cent 
of the Carnegie students take ad­
vantage of a service which is of­
fered for their own pleasure and 
benefit.
This fact docs not speak well for 
a school. When such a large ma­
jority of the students manifest no 
interest whatsoever in religious 
services, there is evidently some­
thing wrong cither with the serv­
ices or with the persons them­
selves.
The chapel meetings are held in 
the Little Theater and presided 
over- by Dr. Baker. Organ music 
precedes the services. During the 
exercises members of the Music 
Department present vocal or in­
strumental selections. There fol­
lows a Scripture reading and a 
short address by the minister of 
one of the larger Pittsburgh 
churches. The Y. M. C. A. secures 
speakers who represent a great 
many denominations and beliefs, 
who arc remarkable for their 
leadership in religious thought, and 
who will speak helpfully upon 
problems pertinent to the college 
bojr or girl. This short devotional 
period is one which appeals to all 
sects; one which is neither heavy 
nor tedious.
Conceding that the chapel meet­
ing is in itself essentially inter­
esting, then we are forced to con­
clude that the reason for the poor 
attendance lies in the students. If 
three-fourths of the student body 
were actually busy with classes, 
studies, or extra-circular activities 
at that time, there would still re­
main a group which would more 
than fill the auditorium. Instead, 
as has been seen, 20 or 25 per­
sons, a mere handful in the empti­
ness of the room, a tiny scattering 
of "Y” cabinet members, -profes­
sors, and instructors, are the- only 
ones who make any attempt to fill 
up the rows of vacant scats. An 
observer would ccrtainly say that 
Carnegie students had no eyes for 
anything but the practicable, the 
tangible, and the immediate.
Is this apparent lack of interest 
wilful or negligent? Do Carnegie 
students see no use in religious 
things? Have they, in their busy 
everyday life, lost a prospective of 
life? And if their disinterest has 
led them to believe, that they can 
get on- very well with only the 
material things which life offers, 
if they have really convinced them­
selves that religious speculation is 
a needless risk, have they even lost 
a sense of school pride,—entirely 
shirked the responsibility of sup­
porting one of the school’s insti­
tutions? It seems so. We request 
a busy minister to speak at one 
of our^chapcl services, and we let 
him come and talk into thin air. 
We provide by means of music 
and reading an atmosphere of wor­
ship, and we let it go to waste. 
We permit the chapcl institution 
by its weakness and ineffectiveness 
to discredit the school; we deprive 
ourselves of what is generally 
recognized as essential to true 
happiness. Surely there is here a 
discrepancy in reasoning.

A Fighting Team
I have watched Carnegie Tech 
play nearly every game in the last 
five seasons, but I have yet to sec 
a Carnegie Tech team with as much 
fight and with as much clean play­
ing in their systems as this year’s 
eleven. , Somehow, or other, I have 
a deep inward feeling of pride 
when this year’s team come onto 
the field; a feeling that it’s the 
greatest fighter in the country and 
that it 'represents your school as 
well as mine. Tears were in my 
eyes as I saw little Johnny Graveno 
go over the goal line with the pig­
skin tucked under his arm in the 
last few minutes of the game with

that there will be no dearth of jokes, 
short stories, and clever illustrations.

to make this year’s PUPPET one of

Co-cds at the UNIVERSITY 
OF MISSOURI may not speak to 
the male students on the streets 
for more than three minutes at a 
time. They must also have a 
chapcron with them when they go 
to a dentist, according to the de­
cree issued by the Dean of Wom­
en recently.
A law has been passed at OHIO 
STATE forcing co-cds to refrain 
from wearing thci^ boy friends’ 
fraternity pins. The statute states: 
"Whoever, not being entitled to do 
so under the rules and regulations 
thereof, wears the badge or button 
of a society or organization of 10 
years’, standing in this state, shall 
be fined not more than. $20, or im­
prisoned not more than 30 days', 
or both.”
"Let’s go native” was the cry at 
NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY 
as the male students prepared for 
the annual celebration of Hobo 
Day, November 6. He-men- of the 
campus shaved themselves for the 
last, time Tuesday, October 27, in 
anticipation of the beaver contest, 
which was a novel feature of the 
homecoming week-end, November 
6-8. A trophy and other attractive 
prizes were selected as awards for 
the man having the longest growth, 
and a jury of impartial judges 
carefully measured the beards.
Co-cds were up in the air about 
"no-shaving” week. One indignant 
feminine student voiccd her feel­
ings by saying "that she couldn’t 
imagine herself dating a man look­
ing like Sir Walter Raleigh or 
Czar Nicholas II. Anyway, the event 
has been adopted as a tradition, 
and for ten days during- the school
year razor blades and shaving 
soap will be discarded.
Freshmen at BARNARD COL­
LEGE arc punished for showing

ALLEGHENY COLLEGE main­
tains a very, very watchful cva
over its co-cds. One freshman co­
ed was "campuscd” for two wcckl 
for giving a male student an as­
signment on the campus. Two
other co-cds were punished for
walking to and from church with 
male escorts.

WASHINGTON AND L E K

ment whereby Sweet Briar girls 
arc to report any drinking on tho 
part of their W. & L. dates on 
the Sweet Briar campus. Infrac­
tions arc reported to the W. & L, 
Executive Council, which penalizes 
said recalcitrant members of its 
student body.
The head of the COLGATE 
psychology laboratory warned the 
male ' students of that school 
against the "peppy, vivacious par- 
ty-girl” as a lifc-partncr. Her 
thyroid.will wear out after about 
five years, and she will probably 
become -listless and dull. .Howev­
er, the professor added that tin 
Colgate men will no doubt con­
tinue to rush the peppy girl, bc^ 
cause "love is not orily blind, but 
also deaf, dumb and insane.”
