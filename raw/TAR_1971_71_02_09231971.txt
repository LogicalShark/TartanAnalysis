CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITYSEPT. 23 , 1971
Armed Robberies
Any member of the campus 
community who believed that this 
or any other urban campus is free 
from the crime that plagues cities 
generally should be thoroughly 
convinced to the contrary after the 
events of the past two weeks.
CMU students have been vic­
tims in eleven separate instances of 
either burglary or robbery since 
the university began the current 
session on September 7th. This is 
somewhat of a record number of 
crimes for this opening period.
The problem involves much 
more than vandalism. In five in­
stances of robbery late Saturday 
night the student victims were all 
confronted with guns. In one other 
incident at 12:45 AM Saturday, 
the robber revealed a knife and 
then struck the victim.
The crimes have thus far seem­
ed to focus on the Margaret Mor­
rison Street (hill dorms) area. 
Three of the armed robberies have 
occured on Margaret Morrison 
Street and one in Boss Hall. Skibo 
parking lot was the scene of one 
robbery on Friday night and an­
other on Saturday.
The majority of burglaries have 
also occured in the hill dorms; two 
in Hammerschlag House and one 
each in Donner and Henderson. 
Over four hundred dollars worth 
of radios, typewriters, cameras and 
other personal property has been 
stolen from the dorms within the 
past two weeks. In most cases the 
burglars were suspected of having 
entered through the dorm room 
window.
Some patterns have developed 
between individual campus crimes. 
In the case of robberies, which 
have tended to occur near or after
midnight, the victims had been 
approached by the robber and ini­
tially asked for drugs or change. It 
is after this point that a weapon 
may appear and the serious busi­
ness of the robbery begins.
In the eleven crimes this semes­
ter only one suspect has been arres­
ted. This was the result not of a 
security patrol, but of the quick 
thinking of a Mudge resident who 
saw the burglar enter another 
room through the window. The 
student went to the door of the 
room and sealed it shut by insert­
ing pennies between the door and 
the frame. He then called the po­
lice who entered the room and ar­
rested the suspect.
Questions continue to be raised 
about the factors involved in cam­
pus crimes. Members of the CMU 
community have questioned the 
effectiveness of a partially armed 
security force. Many feel that this 
is really no deterrent to such 
crimes.
Security director Ron Taylor 
has expressed his concern about 
the possibility of a gun battle any­
where on campus. He has pointed 
out that there are very few places 
on the CMU campus where a gun 
fight would not be a serious risk to 
uninvolved students and 
personnel.
Taylor met early this week with 
the Auxiliary Services Committee 
to discuss several major proposals 
to increase the effectiveness of 
CMU Security. Consideration is 
being given to changes in patrol 
shifts, a tougher policy on the cam­
pus drug traffic which may be 
attracting criminals, and the pos­
sible scheduling of Pittsburgh city 
police patrols on campus.«
Dramatic Arts Complex Designed; 
February Groundbreaking Planned
If all goes well, the ground­
breaking for the first phase of the 
Dramatic Arts Complex will begin 
in February of 1972. The target 
date for completion of this phase is 
in the summer of 1973. The esti­
mated construction cost of this 
new addition to the CMU physical 
plant, to be built behind More- 
wood Gardens, is $2.7 million.
The primary phase, when com­
pleted, will consist of two struc­
tures: one housing a two level 70’ 
by 80’ studio theater with exten­
sive classroom and practice areas 
above, and the second housing a 
multilevel workshop area.
The second and third phases of 
construction will be built when the 
trustees deem it financially feasi­
ble. These phases will consist of 
two separate structures attached 
to opposite sides of the workshop 
structure. One structure will be a
thrust stage area, the other a pro­
scenium stage theater.
The preliminary drawings by 
Taylor and Schweiker Associates 
suggest that an open air earth thea- | 
ter be built on the thrust stage area 
site for temporary purposes. The 
working drawings should be com­
pleted by Dec 1. and bids will be 
accepted and contracts awarded in 
the following two months.*

Statement From Security
Looking at the crime picture 
since the beginning of the semes­
ter, it is only appropriate that it be 
reviewed with the students, and 
this statement is meant to reaffirm 
the fact that this is an urban cam­
pus, that crime is a fact, and that 
the responsibility of preventing 
the crime is as much yours as any­
one’s, but the apprehension phase
is reserved for the public police 
and security.
Robbery is characterized by 
property being taken from the per­
son in the person’s presence, while 
burglary is the taking of property 
from a building. While there’s little 
risk of personal injury in the bur­
glary, the robbery is the opposite. 
A student responding in a rash
manner could well suffer serious 
bodily injury or death,and this we 
want to avoid at all costs. So do 
read this article and follow some of 
the pointers which it may present. 
A description of the robberies: the 
victims, you the students, are gen­
erally male, the robberies occur in 
the late evening hours and some­
times the afternoon, usually on
Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. 
You the student are usually alone 
or with no more than one or, in 
some isolated cases, two other 
students.
The offenders are usually two 
young men who approach you on 
foot and make an initial statement 
to gain your attention and to size 
you up, which consists of: Do you
have any change, do you have any 
dope or grass, or what’s the time? 
After your reply, either a gun or 
knife is sometimes drawn, your 
property taken, and if you don’t 
resist, no force is usually used.
An offender probably realizes 
that you, the student, are:
# not aware that you are living in 
an area where crime is a fact of life

Editor's Note
Throughout the decades, Car- 
negie-Mellon has had a reputation 
as a school with a fine architecture 
department and lousy architec­
ture. For this, we owe thanks to 
the late Captain Henry Horn- 
bostle, first head of the architec­
ture department and architect of 
the original buildings on the Car­
negie Tech campus.
Captain Henry is responsible 
for many and varied architectural 
disasters throughout the city, in­
cluding the hideous Soldiers and 
Sailors Memorial in Oakland, and 
an incomplete Acropolis of ugly 
University of Pittsburgh buildings 
on the hillside leading up to Pitt 
Stadium.
A Hornbostle building is dis­
tinctive; without exception its in­
terior will prove an ideal climate 
for the growth of mushrooms and
various mosses. Maybe I get that 
impression only because the Baker 
Hall windows have gone unwashed 
for over three years.
But let’s put Henry Hornbostle 
and his off-white bricks aside, and 
deal with a new-born aesthetic 
plague on this campus.
Perhaps some who walk the 
Hammerschlag end of the cut have 
recognized, as I have, that Carne- 
gie-Mellon, a school with a res­
pected painting and sculpture 
department, is equipping itself 
with lousy art. It has built a $15 
million structure and compli­
mented it with a stack of building 
scraps.
Who is the neo-Hornbostle res­
ponsible for this? An investigation 
is underway.
Graziano Co., general contrac­
tor for Science Hall, denies having
left three, four-foot sections of air- 
conditioning duct on the cut, and 
no one from our maintenance de­
partment has felt obliged to dis­
pose of it; so I can only assume 
that the thing outside Science Hall 
is supposed to be there.
From this I then conclude that 
the thing is a piece of artwork 
which was purchased by the uni­
versity to lend aesthetic character 
to that culturally deprived end of 
the cut. If so, someone in Warner 
Hall should have “mistake” 
marked on his administrative re­
port card in small red letters.
Who did that thing? Who pur­
chased it? It’s ugly, it’s dull, it’s 
chintzy, it’s unimaginative, and I 
can’t help but think that it’s the 
product of one of Graziano’s.

Letters
I would like to have this printed 
under “Letters to the Editor” in 
the next issue, in FULL. If not, I 
can see what type of newspaper 
this is!!! P.S. I don’t believe any 
deletions are necessary—thank 
you!
Dear Editor:
I was wondering if CMU had a 
student newspaper, and was de­
lighted to see them this past Thur­
sday upon leaving Baker Hall. Hav­
ing been the editor of a college 
newspaper last year (The AL­
LEGHENY VUE, Allegheny Com­
munity College’s school newspa­
per, on the North Side of Pitts­
burgh) I almost instinctively 
turned to the editorial on page 
two, under “Editor’s Note”.
Although it was unsigned, and 
listed as an editorial, I took the 
liberty of assuming that it was Mr. 
Campbell’s.
I was and am one of those stu­
dents mentioned in the article. 
Please let me explain ...
FIRST, I am a new Junior 
at CMU, having transferred from 
ACC last semester.
* SECOND, I am “riding the Gra­
vy Train” as Mr. Campbell calls it, 
on a part scholarship.
THIRD, I have been outside 
the Academic Womb” for eight 
years, having returned part-time in
1968, and full-time in 1970.
Because of the above listed, I 
feel qualified to react (if that was 
the purpose of the article) to the 
Editor’s Note.” College may 
seem a big joke to many half-assed 
students in and around the TAR­
TAN working area, but to vent 
such a narrow-minded, sarcastic o- 
pinion in an editorial is beyond 
reproach.
Would you mind explaining in 
lay men terms exactly what the 
hell you meant in that article? As 
for categorizing the professors as 
half-assed”, and insinuating that 
they are allowed a “lifetime ride 
on the Gravy Train”, why not state 
specific names, or haven’t you got 
the balls? At least that would have
given some worth to the “filler” 
you inserted under “Editor’s 
Note”.
I was absolutely going to join 
the staff of the TARTAN, but jud­
ging from its present editor, I think 
I shall wait until next semester (or 
year), and apply for the position of 
editor myself.
Sincerely, with love,
Joe Harsch

Science Hall
Editor:
We are all very happy now that 
the Science Hall has been opened 
accomodating the computer and a 
library, besides several depart­
ments and faculty offices. It is 
cool, bright and spacious. Howev­
er, it is surprising to note that there 
is not a single light on the mall 
running between Baker Hall and 
Doherty Hall and it is quite dark at 
night. Science Hall is going to be 
one of the busiest, and many peo­
ple would be using it during night 
time. I therefore hope very much 
that some lights will be installed to 
make the walk to the building safe 
and easy at night.

SUPA
Robbed!
Editor, TARTAN:
A funny thing happened on my 
way to Scobell Hall the other 
night. I was robbed (for the third 
time in two semesters) along with a 
friend of mine. So what? Nothing 
unusual, you say. Nothing except 
that we were in the presence of 
two security officers at the time of 
the hold-up. It seems that the rob­
bers had a gun, but to my surprise, 
security did not, and in fact, never 
does. Now I am not in favor of
creating a police state here on cam­
pus with nightly shoot-outs along 
Margaret Morrison Street to enter­
tain dormitory residents, however 
it seems to me that if a person 
knew that security was armed with 
some type of weapon, that person 
would be less likely to commit the 
crime in the first place. With Key­
stone cops in charge, the robber 
has nothing to lose. He can practi­
cally bluff his way through any 
situation.
Something must be done. The 
conditions are not improving. My 
friend and I discovered that more 
robberies occurred the night we 
were victimized than during the 
first two weeks of class. If security 
does not become equippped to 
handle an armed robbery, the ad­
ministration should be made res­
ponsible for reimbursing victims. 
This last suggestion is not as unfea­
sible as it may sound. We can sim­
ply use the budget now allocated 
to security and terminate securi­
ty’s “function” permanently. Un­
armed, security is insecure, and in 
fact, non-existent.
Sincerely,
Dale T. Laurin
Send Help!
kind ladies and kind gentlemen
having failed in the many at­
tempts I did not make, I have de­
cided to turn to the TARTAN for 
aid and supplication. As you are 
probably not aware, last year I was 
C-MU student number 49338. As 
the postmark on the envelope may 
indicate, l am not in Pittsburgh at 
the present time, nor will I be so 
for a while, (hold on, I’m getting 
around to my great problem, never 
fear).
As a practicing member of the 
mass known as humanity, I esta­
blished some rather fond acquain­
tances amongst the Carnegie com­
munity. Most of these people are 
out of communication with me 
now, a fact not conducive to the 
maintainance of my sanity. All of 
them have new addresses, I’ll have
you understand, and I have just 
changed my address for the second 
time in three months. What I am 
requesting of you then is that you 
publish this piece of turgid prose in 
your find newspaper and thus 
bring joy into the hearts of thou­
sands of youngsters everywhere.
My address is now 123 N. Bas­
sett St., Madison Wisconsin 53703, 
phone 608-251-1071. Anyone 
who wishes to contact me now will 
know where I’m at, thanks to you, 
dear TARTAN. Oh, my hero ....
Oh, and yes: if you’re travelin 
in the North Country Fair, please 
say hello to one who lives there, 
bones (yes, that is my name)
Dear Doug:
Congratulations to you and 
your staff on a fine first issue 
—readable, interesting, not too 
crowded, and full of things we 
want to know.
Sincerely,
Daniel P. Resnick 
Chairman of the Faculty
Europe
Dear Editor:
Since I spent “the best summer 
of my life” just recently in Europe 
after four months with CMU’s 
semester in Paris, I have been tell­
ing all my friends out there in 
TARTAN-reading land that Euope 
is wonderful. Understandably, I 
resent Joel Schwartz’s dictionary - 
like explanation of what that 
means found in last week’s edition.
Taking a serious look at any­
thing mildly divergent from the 
Pittsburgh existance is the best ed­
ucational experience a student can 
buy. Admittedly, I had a slightly 
different itinerary than Joel: I 
went to Czechoslovakia, Austria, 
Yugoslavia, and rural England. 
Anyone who dumbly follows his 
“Harvard Student Guide to Eur­
ope” from Amsterdam to Copen­
hagen to Brussels to Rome will 
meet many other lost American 
kids. I met Czechs, Yugoslavs, 
Austrians and tourists from other 
nations. English will not take you
everywhere, and perhaps Mr. 
Schwartz is limited in his ability to 
“meet the natives” by a lack of 
languages. Still, one near drunk 
Macedonian and his family did 
make dinner in a cafe unique sim­
ply through his friendliness and 
good beer. Nevertheless, with me 
speaking French and my friend 
speaking German, our chances to 
talk with someone anywhere were 
above average.
I read in Life Magazine that the 
well beaten tourist path was es­
pecially well trodden this summer; 
but I missed all the big cities ex­
cept Prague. If Joel had sought out 
the small town cafes where every 
head turns with curiosity and the 
local foreign language nut starts 
conversation, he might have stories 
of kids facing the identity crisis 
within the structure of socialism.
I am disturbed that a fellow stu­
dent traveler found the accomoda­
tions insufficient, but was he really 
expecting a chain of Howard John­
sons? Hotels are for either the rich 
or those who consider two sleeping 
bags and a decent, light-weight 
tent too much to stuff into those 
Gerry packs. The truly interna­
tional student set meets in the 
campgrounds and youth hostels. I 
lived in the campground of Cam­
bridge, England three days with 
four Frenchmen, six Swedes and 
several British, and missed a lot of 
historic Cambridge staying home 
talking about mores in 
Scandanavia.
My point is that Europe can be 
good, done the right way. Ameri­
can Express has a fine tour, “Eur­
ope in Seventeen Days”, for those 
who must schedule London 
Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, a bull 
fight in Barcelona, and the Sistine 
Chapel in the “lesser part” of their 
summer vacation and make it back 
so as not to miss much of the ex­
citement in Pittsburgh. But believe 
me, there are those of us who had a 
hell of a good time and sometimes 
even wish we were there now.

The Student As Nigger
Students are niggers. When you 
get that straight, our schools begin 
to make sense. It’s more impor­
tant, though, to understand why 
they’re niggers. If we follow that 
question seriously enough, it will 
lead us past the zone of academic 
bullshit, where dedicated teachers 
pass their knowledge on to a new 
generation, and into the nitty- 
-gritty of human needs and hang­
ups. And from there we can go on 
to consider whether it might ever 
be possible for students to come 
up from slavery.
First let’s see what’s happening 
now. Let’s look at the role stu­
dents play in what we like to Call 
education.
At Cal State L.A., where I 
teach, the students have separate 
and unequal dining facilities. If I 
take them into the faculty dining 
room, my colleagues get uncom­
fortable, as though there were a 
bad smell. If I eat in the student 
cafeteria, I become known as the 
educational equivalent of a nigger- 
lover. In at least one building there 
are even rest rooms which students 
may not use. At Cal State, also, 
there is an unwritten law barring 
student-faculty lovemaking. For­
tunately, this antimiscegenation 
law, like its Southern counterpart, 
is not 100 percent effective.
Students at Cal State are politi­
cally disenfranchised. They are in 
an academic Lowndes County. 
Most of them can vote in national 
elections—their average age is 
about 26—but they have no voice 
in the decisions which affect their 
academic lives. The students are, it 
is true, allowed to have a toy gov­
ernment run for the most part by 
Uncle Toms and concerned princi­
pally with trivia. The faculty and 
administrators decide what 
courses will be offered; the stu­
dents get to choose their own 
Homecoming Queen. Occasionally 
when student leaders get uppity 
and rebellious, they’re either ig­
nored, put off with trivial conces­
sions, or manoeuvered expertly 
out of position.
A student at Cal State is ex­
pected to know his place. He calls a 
faculty member “Sir” or “Doctor” 
or “Professor”—and he smiles and 
shuffles*some as he stands outside 
the professor’s office waiting for 
permission to enter. The faculty 
tell him what courses to take (in 
my department, English, even elec­
tives have to be approved by a fac­
ulty member); they tell him what 
to read, what to write, and, fre­
quently, where to set the margins 
on his typewriter. They tell him 
what’s true and what isn’t. Some 
teachers insist that they encourage 
dissent but they’re almost always 
jiving and every student knows it. 
Tell the man what he wants to hear 
or he’ll fail your ass out of the 
course.
When a teacher says “jump,” 
students jump. I know of one 
professor who refused to take up 
class time for exams and required 
students to show up for tests at 
6:30 in the morning. And they did, 
by God! Another, at exam time, 
provides answer cards to be filled 
out-each one enclosed in a paper 
bag with a hole cut in the top to see 
through. Students stick their writ­
ing hands in the bags while taking 
the test. The teacher isn’t a provo;
I wish he were. He does it to pre­
vent cheating. Another colleague 
once caught a student reading dur­
ing one of his lectures and threw 
her book against the wall. Still an­
other lectures his students into a 
stupor and then screams at them in 
a rage when they fall asleep.
Just last week during the first 
meeting of a class, one girl got up 
to leave after about ten minutes 
had gone by. The teacher rushed 
over, grabbed her by the arm, say­
ing “This class is NOT dismissed!” 
and led her back to her seat. On the 
same day another teacher began by 
informing his class that he does not 
like beards, mustaches, long hair 
on boys, or capri pants on girls, 
and will not tolerate any of that in 
his class. The class, incidentally, 
consisted mostly of high school 
teachers.
Even more discouraging than 
this Auschwitz approach to educa­
tion is the fact that the students 
take it. They haven’t gone through 
twelve years of public school for 
nothing. They’ve learned one thing 
and perhaps only one thing during 
those twelve years. They’ve forgot­
ten their algebra. They’re hopeless­
ly vague about chemistry and 
physics. They’ve grown to fear and 
resent literature. They write like 
they’ve been lobotomized. But, 
Jesus, can they follow orders! 
Freshmen come up to me with an 
essay and ask if I want it folded, 
and whether their name should be 
in the upper right hand corner. 
And I want to cry and kiss them 
and caress their poor tortured 
heads.
Students don’t ask that orders 
make sense. They give up expect­
ing things to make sense long be­
fore they leave elementary school. 
Things are true because the teacher 
says they’re true. At a very early 
age we all learn to accept “two 
truths,” as did certain medieval 
churchmen. Outside of class, 
things are true to your tongue, 
your fingers, your stomach, your 
heart. Inside class, things are true 
by reason of authority. And that’s 
just fine because you don’t care 
anyway. Miss Wiedemeyer tells 
you a noun is a person, place or 
thing. So let it be. You don’t give a 
rat’s ass; she doesn’t give a rat’s ass.
The important thing is to please 
her. Back in kindergarten, you 
found out that teachers only love 
children who stand in nice straight 
lines. And that’s where it’s been 
ever since. Nothing changes except 
to get worse. School becomes 
more and more obviously a prison.
Then there’s the infamous 
“code of dress.” In some high 
schools, if your skirt looks too 
short, you have to kneel betore the 
principal, in a brief allegory of 
fellatio. If the hem doesn’t reach 
the floor, you go home to change 
while he, presumably, jacks off. 
Boys in high school can’t be too 
sloppy and they can’t even be too 
sharp. You’d think the school 
board would be delighted to see all 
the spades trooping to school in 
pointy shoes, suits, ties and stingy 
brims. Uh-uh. They’re too visible.
What school amounts to, then, 
for white and black kids alike, is a 
12-year course in how to be slaves. 
What else could explain what I see 
in a freshman class? They’ve got 
that slave mentality: obliging and 
ingratiating on the surface but hos­
tile and resistent underneath.
As do black slaves, students 
vary in their awareness of what’s 
going on. Some recognize their 
own put-on for what it is and even 
let their rebellion break through to 
the surface now and then. Oth­
ers—including most of the “good 
students”—have been more deeply 
brainwashed. They swallow the 
bullshit with greedy mouths. They 
honest-to-God believe in grades, in 
busy work, in General Education 
requirements. They’re pathetically 
eager to be pushed around. 
They’re like those old grey-headed 
house niggers you can still find in 
the South who don’t see what all 
the fuss is about because Mr. Char­
lie “treats us real good.”
College entrance requirements 
tend to favor the Toms and screen 
out the rebels. Not entirely, of 
course. Some students at Cal State 
L.A. are expert con artists who 
know perfectly well what’s hap­
pening. They want the degree or 
the 2-S and spend their years on 
the old plantation alternately 
laughing and cursing as they play 
the game. If their egos are strong 
enough, they cheat a lot. And, of 
course, even the Toms are angry 
down deep somewhere. But it 
comes out in passive rather than 
active aggression. They’re unex- 
plainably thick-witted and subject 
to frequent spells of laziness. They 
misread simple questions. They 
spend their nights mechanically 
outlining history chapters while 
meticulously failing to compre­
hend a word of what’s in front of 
them.
The saddest cases among both 
black slaves and student slaves are 
the ones who have so thoroughly 
introjected their masters’ values 
that their anger is all turned in­
ward. At Cal State these are the 
kids for whom every low grade is 
torture, who stammer and shake 
when they speak to a professor, 
who go through an emotional crisis 
every time they’re called upon dur­
ing class. You can recognize them 
easily at finals time. Their faces are 
festooned with fresh pimples; their 
bowels boil audibly across the 
room. If their really is a Last Judg­
ment, then the parents and teach­
ers who created these wrecks are 
going to burn in hell.
So students are niggers. It’s 
time to find out why, and to do 
this we have to take a long look at 
Mr. Charlie.
The teachers I know best are 
college professors. Outside the 
classroom and taken as a group, 
their most striking characteristic is 
timidity. They’re short on balls.
Just look at their working con­
ditions. At a time when even mi­
grant workers have begun to fight 
and win, college professors are still 
afraid to make more than a token 
effort to improve their pitiful eco­
nomic status. In California state 
colleges the faculties are screwed 
regularly and vigorously by the
Governor and Legislature and yet 
they still won’t offer any solid re­
sistance. They lie flat on their 
stomachs with their pants down, 
mumbling catch phrases like “pro­
fessional dignity” and “meaning­
ful dialogue.”
Now, of course, there’s the 
Vietnamese war. It gets some op­
position from a few teachers. 
Some support it. But a vast num­
ber of professors who know per­
fectly well what’s happening, are 
copping out again. And in the high 
schools, you can forget it. Stillness 
reigns.
I’m not sure why teachers are so 
chickenshit. It could be that aca­
demic training itself forces a split 
between thought and action. It 
might also be that the tenured se­
curity of a teaching job attracts 
timid persons and, furthermore, 
that teaching, like police work, 
pulls in persons who are unsure of 
themselves and need weapons and 
the other external trappings of 
authority.
At any rate teachers ARE short 
on balls. And, as Judy Eisenstein 
has eloquently pointed out, the 
classroom offers an artificial and 
protected environment in which 
they can exercise their will to pow­
er. Your neighbors may drive a bet­
ter care; gas station attendants 
may intimidate you; your wife 
may dominate you; the State Leg­
islature may shit on you; but in the 
classroom, by God, students do 
what you say—or else. The grade is 
a hell of a weapon. It may not rest 
on your hip, potent and rigid like a 
cop’s gun, but in the long run it’s 
more powerful. At your personal 
whim—any time you choose—you 
can keep 35 students up for nights 
and have the pleasure of seeing 
them walk into the classroom 
pasty-faced and red-eyed earring a 
sheaf of typewritten pages, with 
title page, MLA footnotes and 
margins set at 15 and 91.
The general timidity which 
causes teachers to make niggers of 
their students usually includes a 
more specific fear-fear of the stu­
dents themselves. After all, stu­
dents are different, just like black 
people. You stand exposed in 
front of them, knowing that their 
interests, their values and their lan­
guage are different from yours. To 
make matters worse, you may sus­
pect that you yourself are not the 
most engaging of persons. What 
then can protect you from their 
ridicule and scorn?
Respect for authority. That’s 
what. It’s the policeman’s gun 
again. The white bwana’s pith hel­
met. So you flaunt that authority. 
You wither whisperers with a mur­
derous glance. You crush objectors 
with erudition and heavy irony. 
And, worst of all, you make your 
own attainments seem not acces­
sible but awesomely remote. You 
conceal your massive ignorance— 
and parade a slender learning.
The teacher’s fear is mixed with 
an understandable need to be ad­
mired and to feel superior-a need 
which also makes him cling to his 
“white supremacy.” Ideally, a 
teacher should minimize the dis­
tance between himself and his stu­
dents. He should encourage them
not to need him—eventually or 
even immediately. But this is rare­
ly the case. Teachers make them­
selves high priests of arcane mys­
teries. They become masters of 
mumbo-jumbo. Even a more of 
less conscientious teacher may be 
torn between the need to five and 
the need to hold back, between the 
desire to free his students and the 
desire to hold them in bondage to 
him.
Finally, there’s the darkest rea­
son of all for the master-slave ap­
proach to education. The less 
trained and the less socialized a 
person is, the more he constitutes i" 
sexual threat and the more he will 
be subjugated by institutions, such 
as penitentiaries and schools. 
Many of us are aware by now of 
the sexual neurosis which makes 
white man so fearful of integrated 
schools and neighborhoods, and 
which makes the castration of Ne­
groes a deeply entrenched South­
ern folkway. We should recognize 
a similar pattern in education. 
There is a kind of castration that 
goes on in schools. It begins before 
school years with parents’ first en­
croachments on their children’s 
free unashamed sexuality and con­
tinues right up to the day when 
they hand you your doctoral di­
ploma with a bleeding, shriveled 
pair of testicles stapled to the 
parchment. It’s not that sexuality 
has no place in the classroom. 
You’ll find it there but only in 
certain perverted and viti *^d 
forms.
How does sex show up in 
school? First of all, there’s the 
sado-masochistic relationship be­
tween teachers and students. 
That’s plenty sexual, although the 
price for enjoying it is to be una­
ware of what’s happening. In walks 
the teacher in his Ivy League equiv­
alent of a motorcycle jacket. In 
walks the teacher—a kind of intel­
lectual rough trade—and flogs his 
students with grades, tests, sar­
casm and snotty superiority until 
their very brains are bleeding. In 
Swinburne’s England, the whipped 
school boy frequently grew up to 
be a flagellant. With us the perver­
sion is intellectual but it’s no less 
perverse.
Sex also shows up in the class­
room as academic subject matter- 
sanitized and abstracted, thor­
oughly divorced from feeling. You 
get “sex education” now in both 
high school and college classes: 
everyone determined not to be em­
barrassed, to be very up to date, 
very contempo. These are the 
classes for which sex, as Feiffer 
puts it, “can be a beautiful thing if 
properly administered.” And then, 
of course, there’s still another de­
pressing manifestation of «ex in- 
the classroom, the “off-color” 
teacher who keeps his class awake 
with sniggering sexual allusions, 
obscene titters and academic in- 
uendo. The sexuality he purveys, it 
must be admitted, is at least better 
than none at all.
What’s missing, from kindergar­
ten to graduate school, is honest 
recognition of what’s actually 
happening-turned-on awareness 
of hairy goodies underneath the
continued pt. 8

Fredrico Felini’s THE 
CLOWNS is an amusingly melan­
choly look at an institution which, 
like the circus it is a part of, is 
fading into oblivion. This is not to 
say that the film is a documentary, 
an indepth study, or even solely 
about clowns. Rather, it would 
perhaps be more correct to state 
that THE CLOWNS is a motion 
picture about what Felini feels 
about clowns and the men who 
portray them.
Felini’s artistic brilliance clear­
ly becomes apparent to his audi­
ence when, as they watch him un­
fold his film, they become aware 
of how he is subtly manipulating 
them so that they too will share his 
feelings about clowns. These feel­
ings are not the ones which persons 
traditionally hold, for instead of a
vehicle of mirth, Felini views the 
clown as a vehicle of sadness. In­
deed, when, as a child, he attended 
his first circus he was not amused 
by the antics of the clowns, but 
rather was reduced to tears. This 
impression, softened by the pas­
sage of time has now become a sort 
of gentle melancholy, and it is this 
feeling which Felini permits to per­
vade his entire film—even the slap­
stick sequences.
This is a highly unusual ap­
proach to such a subject, and only 
a master such as Felini could have 
executed it so fantastically well. 
The only unfortunate aspect about 
this approach is that while it will 
certainly be appreciated and sa­
vored by the adult members of the 
audience, most likely it will tend 
to bore those youngsters who wan­
dered into the theater in search of 
ninety minutes of sheer buffoon­
ery. There are laughs in THE 
CLOWNS to be sure—it would be 
difficult to make a film treating 
this subject without them. These 
laugfrs, however, are not the reason 
Felini made his film, and anyone 
who goes to this film in search of 
them is apt to be somewhat disap­
pointed.
Instead of belly laughs, what 
the viewer will receive for the price 
of his ticket is the rare opportunity 
to witness a minor cinematic mas­
terpiece unfold before his eyes as 
he watches a master film maker 
express his rather serious feelings 
about a whimsical subject in a film 
which never becomes pedantic and 
never takes itself too seriously 
either.¦

Thursday, September 23, 1971-The Tartan-Page 7
RODEF SHALOM CONGREGATION, on Fifth & 
Morewood Avenues, will offer a special KOL 
NIDRE SERVICE for University Students.
A new liturgy will be introduced. The service will be held 
in Freehof Hali on Tuesday, September 28th at 8:00 p.m.
MISS JOY HYMAN, renowned folk singer from England and 
the continent, will sing both tradition and new melodies.
• EVERYONE IS INVITED TO JOIN US FOR THIS SERVICE •
PITTSBURGH (IPL)-The Sep­
tember 16 edition of the Carnegie- 
Mellon University publication, 
THE TARTAN, created a strong 
surge of response throughout the 
country as it hit the newstands last 
Thursday. Its new format and de­
sign were especially noted and ap­
preciated by the campus commu­
nity but was even more outstand­
ing in the wake of its nationwide 
sweep. Mahlon Lovett, the design 
editor of the newspaper and the 
student most responsible for the 
TARTAN’s radical new look, is 
quoted to have said, “Hello.”
Wall Street Reacts 
In response to the innovation in 
journalism represented by last 
Thursday’s TARTAN, trading be­
came heavy on the New York Ex­
change on the Friday following its 
publication, and by the end of the 
day over sixteen million shares had 
changed hands. The Dow Jones In­
dustrials closed up 2.23, rails up an 
average 1.59, utilities up .88, and 
stocks closed at an average of 4.30 
per share higher. One spokesman 
on the floor termed the day “hec­
tic.” President Nixon hailed the 
TARTAN’s effort as “a shot in the 
arm” for the publishing business 
and immediately dashed off a form 
telegram congratulating Douglas 
Campbell, editor, and the TAR­
TAN staff.
Labor Leaders Dissent 
Meanwhile, organized labor 
took opposing stands to the TAR­
TAN’s action. George Meany, pres­
ident of the AFL-CIO, blasted the 
move as “dehumanizing” and com­
plained that “work done by men 
ought not to be defined by com­
puters.” Meany, in describing the 
process of laying out the news­
paper, said:
“It has been shown that it takes 
one man (Mr. Lovett) more hours 
to do more work by this method 
than it took five staffers during the 
course of an evening. The total 
man-hours are, of course, less .. . 
using the computerized system, 
but now one man has been unfairly 
overloaded with work, in defiance 
of the Fair Labor Practices agree­
ment of 1967.”
Disagreement with this view 
was expressed by the International 
Union of Computation Machine
Servicers (IUCMS), representing
250,000 employees of IBM, 
Honeywell, and other computing 
machine headquarters. One IBM 
employee described the new TAR­
TAN as “a milestone.”
Rumor Squelched 
A rumor spreading quickly 
across Pittsburgh was that the 
Typesetters Union Local 1103 of 
the Pittsburgh Press Co. was going 
back on strike after viewing the 
TARTAN and the new equipment 
used to put out the text. The union 
reportedly wanted less man-hours 
per edition and expressed the de­
sire that the Press come out on 
Thursdays only. The editor of the 
Press, however, confirmed that the 
newspaper will continue to publish 
until further notice, and despite 
the action of the TARTAN, “we’re 
back to work for good, even better 
than the last time we struck.” 
Meanwhile, the Press and the Post- 
Gazette are in their fourth straight 
day of publishing, on their wav to 
breaking their last record of five 
weeks, one day.
Other Repercussions
Alcoa Aluminum lowered its 
prices on five grades of aluminum 
sheet in response to the \fride de­
mand created by the Thursday edi­
tion of the TARTAN. The type 
used to print the text of the news­
paper is made from lightweight 
aluminum spheres, and inserted 
into the IBM typewriter. So far, 
five domestic and one major for­
eign newspapers have adopted this 
system.
The National Association of I 
Journalists and Publishers I 
(NAJAP) commended the TAR- I 
TAN on its clean look and new I 
format, and telephoned Deisgn 
Editor Lovett through its national I 
secretary. They also recommended j 
the Carnegie-Mellon newspaper I 
drop its cartoon feature from its I 
content, describing it as an “unfor- I 
tunate incident.” The TARTAN I 
has as yet not responded to their I 
comment.
WRCT announced they will I 
continue to bombard the TAR- I 
TAN office with the signal from I 
their radio station across the hall. I 
Douglas Campbell, TARTAN edi­
tor, made an inaudible reply.¦

Seat renovation is proceeding nicely in Doherty Hall 2315 following many complaints by students and 
faculty. Workmen are shown here dismantling the new seats and replacing them once again with the old 
seats, which had been stored in Science Hall. As Science Hall was occupied, however, there was no room 
to keep the seats; thus, they were reinstalled. Professors are glad to see the change back to the old seats 
for they tended to keep students awake. Most of the new seats should be out by Saturday—the old seats 
will be back by next Wednesday.
The new seats will be packed and taken to the parking lot of Morewood Gardens where they will be 
stored until their installation in the theatre of the new Fine Arts Complex.*

petti-pants, the chinos and the 
flannels. It’s not that sex needs to 
be pushed in school; sex is push 
enough. But we should let it be, 
where it is and like it is. I don’t 
insist that ladies in junior high 
school lovingly caress their stu­
dent’s cocks (someday maybe); 
however, it is reasonable to ask 
that the ladies don’t, by example 
and stricture, teach their students 
to pretend that those cocks aren’t 
there. As things stand now, stu­
dents are psychically castrated or 
spayed—and for the very same rea­
son that black men are castrated in 
Georgia; because they’re a threat.
So you can add sexual repres­
sion to the list of causes, along 
with vanity, fear and will to power, 
that turn the teacher into Mr. 
Charlie. You might also want to 
keep in mind that he was a nigger 
once himself and has never really 
gotten over it. And there are more 
causes, some of which are better
described in sociological than in 
psychological terms. Work them 
out, it’s not hard. But in the mean­
time what we’ve got on our hands 
is a whole lot of niggers. And what 
makes this particularly grim is that 
the student has less chance than 
the black man of getting out of his 
bag. Because the student doesn’t 
even know he’s in it. That, more or 
less, is what’s happening in higher 
education. And the results are 
staggering.
For one thing damn little edu­
cation takes place in the schools. 
How could it? You can’t educate 
slaves; you can only train them. 
Or, to use an even uglier and more 
timely word, you can only pro­
gram them.
At my school we even grade 
people on how they read poetry. 
That’s like grading people on how 
they fuck. But we do it. In fact, 
God help me, I do it. I’m the 
Adolph Eichmann of English 323.
Simon Legree on the poetry plan­
tation. “Tote that iamb! List that 
spondee!” Even to discuss a good 
poem in that environment is po­
tentially dangerous because the 
very classroom is contaminated. 
As hard as I may try to turn stu­
dents on to poetry, I know that the 
desks, the tests, the IBM cards, 
their own attitudes toward school, 
and my own residue of UCLA 
method are turning them off.

ery is equally serious. Students 
don’t get emancipated when they 
graduate. As a matter of fact, we 
don’t let them graduate until 
they’ve demonstrated their wil­
lingness-over 16 years—to remain 
slaves. And for important jobs, like 
teaching, we make them go 
through more years just to make 
sure. What I’m getting at is that 
we’re all more or less niggers and 
slaves, teachers and students alike. 
This is a fact you want to start with 
in trying to understand wider 
school phenomena, say, politics, in 
our country and in other 
countries.
Educational oppression is trick­
ier to fight than racial oppression. 
If you’re a black rebel, they can’t 
exile you; they either have to inti­
midate you or kill you. But in high 
school or college they can just 
bounce you out of the fold. And 
they do.
Rebel students and renegade 
faculty members get smothered or 
shot down with devastating accu­
racy. In high school, it’s usually 
the student who gets it; in college 
it’s more often the teacher. Others 
get tired of fighting and voluntari­
ly leave the system. This may be a 
mistake though. Dropping out of 
college for a rebel is a little like 
going North for a Negro. You can’t 
really get away from it so you 
might as well stay and raise hell.
How do you raise hell? That’s a 
whole other article. But just for a 
start, why not stay with the anal­
ogy? What have black people 
done? They have, first of all, faced 
the fact of their slavery. They’ve 
stopped kidding themselves about 
an eventual reward in that Great 
Watermelon Patch in the sky. 
They’ve organized; they’ve de­
cided to get freedom now, and 
they’ve started taking it.
Students, like black people, 
have immense unused power. They 
could, theoretically, insist on par­
ticipating in their own education. 
They could make academic free­
dom bilateral. They could teach 
their teachers to thrive on love and 
admiration, rather than fear and 
respect, and to lay down their wea­
pons. Students could discover 
community. And they could learn 
to dance by dancing on the IBM 
cards. They could make coloring 
books out of the catalogs and they
could put the grading system in a 
museum. They could raze one set 
of walls and let life come blowing 
into the classroom. They could 
raze another set of walls and let 
education flow out and flood the 
streets. They could turn the class­
room into where it’s at—a “field of 
action” as Peter Marin describes it. 
And believe it or not, they could 
study eagerly and learn prodi­
giously for the best of all possible 
reasons—their own reasons.
They could. Theoretically. 
They have the pdwer. But only in a 
very few places, like Berkeley, 
have they even begun to think 
about using it. For students, as for 
black people, the hardest battle 
isn’t with Mr. Charlie. It’s with 
what Mr. Charlie has done to your 
mind. ¦
The author, Jerry Farber, wrote 
this article in 1968 while an En­
glish professor at UCLA. Although 
dated, it still makes for interesting 
reading, whether you feel students 
are niggers or passengers on the 
Gravy Train. It was published 
here before on September 19,
1969.

knees. Rich Squires started to click 
as the game wore on, often finding 
Brian Carlock and Chuck Price 
wide open. But somehow the Tar­
tans couldn’t quite put it together.
Tom Lombardo, Brian Carlock, 
and Chuck Price chalked up six 
points each and Tom Sumter got
his first fumble for the year, but 
personal achievements are often 
overshadowed by the scoreboard. 
As Howard Cosell once said,“One 
game doesn’t a season make!”
With that in mind, the team is 
bouncing back and is looking a- 
head to its home opener with 
Washington and Jefferson, Satur­
day at 1:30. Last year they came 
back from W & J, 1-1. Saturday 
CMU plans to come out 1-1 again, 
on its way to a near perfect season. 
One thing they do need is student 
support. So, get your Boone’s 
Farm and your girl and head for 
the festivities Saturday. We’re the 
team in Red!.

CMU’s Athletic Director Ray­
mond Haynes today announced 
the addition of Kenyon College to 
its 1971 football schedule. The
Tartans will play the Kenyon 
Lords Saturday, October 9, at 
Gambier, Ohio.
The game will bring the total on 
this year’s CMU schedule to nine, 
the first time the Tartans have pla 
yed more than eight games since 
1964, when they also played nine.
The two teams met once be­
fore, in 1911, when Kenyon won,
6-0.
The Tartans originally had an 
open date on October 9, while 
Kenyon’s game with Lake Forest 
College on the date had been can­
celled.¦

Football
Last week I stated that the Tar­
tans were going 8 and 0 this year. 
I’m still not wrong, but things 
don’t look as good. Kenyon Col- 
5> lege has been added to the football 
schedule on October 9, which gives 
CMU eight more games.
The Tartans traveled to Green­
ville, home of Thiel College. All 
last week they gave every indicat­
ion of bringing home a victory, but 
somehow the Titans sneaked by. 
The completion of the game could 
W be described in one play: the Tar­
tan’s triple-option. Here the quart- 
er-back can do one of three things 
with the ball: hand off to the full­
back up the middle, keep it him­
self, running an end sweep, or at 
the last second lateral to a half­
back. The Tartans missed stopping 
the play all afternoon—and they
Intramural
Welcome to the ’71-2 Intra­
mural Program. This year starts 
with what should be the most exci­
ting football season in years. The 
Major Leagues have been trimmed 
of some weaker teams, leaving the 
rest of the teams more evenly 
matched. The Intermediate Lea­
gue comprised of those teams 
dropping from the Majors, also will 
be playing an exciting brand of 
football, as Monday’s openers 
showed.
Predictions of winners in the 
past years were hard, but this year 
the choice is even tougher. The 
National League should go to Pep­
per and Salt, but not unless they 
can stop the champions of the last 
two years, Pika, led by MVP Barry 
Benjamin. Another team that 
should be up there is a very big 
GSIA squad. They feature a huge 
front line, and if they click, P&S 
has to worry. A dark horse is ATO, 
still plagued by QB problems. But 
their running game is as strong as 
ever.
The American League seems to 
be a three team race with Beta,
SAE, and the Black Magics. Right 
now Beta looks like the team to 
beat. Ralph Hershberger moves up 
to QB after leading their B team to 
third in the school last year. SAE 
has most of its offense back, and 
the defense will be the key to their 
season. If The Black Magics have 
the quality of past years* teams, 
they’ll be tough. If there is anyone 
else close in this league, it’s pro­
bably DU Grade A, SN, or the So­
lid State.
The Intermediate-Western 
like a battle, with any of the first 
five teams having a chance. My 
guess right now is the Oakland A.s 
in first place. The Eastern looks a 
little clearer, Clackers, Nads, or the 
Shrinks.
Come out and see some great 
football.*

CMLPs soccer team opens the 
1971 season this Saturday, Sep­
tember 25. The Booters take on St. 
Vincent at Latrobe at 1:00 PM.
Last year the Tartan Booters 
finished third in the 12-team West­
ern Pennsylvania Intercollegiate 
Soccer Conference (WPISC) and 
placed four players on the WPISC 
All-Conference teams. Only two of 
the four returned: %Peter Moses, 
highest vote recipient on offense 
for the WPISC teams, and veteran 
goalie Jack Borsewitz. Lost are de­
fense stalwarts Juan Neffa and Bri­
an Newick, both All-WPISC select­
ions, Neffa being the highest vote 
getter on defense.
Moses, outstanding last year de­
spite serious ailments, leads a nuc­
leus of returning sophomores who 
dominate the starting lineup. The 
lone starting senior will be Borse­
witz. Head coach March Krotee 
has several promising freshmen on 
his 36-man squad and feels that 
over-all this year’s team is stronger 
than the 1970 squad. However,he 
figures that with the opposition 
even more improved it will be 
tough to equal last year’s ARNRE re­
cord.»
