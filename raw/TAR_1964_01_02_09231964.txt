9.Former Vietnam Ambassador 
To Speak At First Assembly
The honorable Tran Van Chuong, former South Viet­
namese Ambassador to the United States, will speak at the 
first all-school assembly at 11:30 a.m. on September 29 in the 
Wherrett Room of Skibo.
The father of Madam Ngo 
’^Dinh Nhu, Dr. Chuong served as 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
Indo-China before associating 
with the Diem government. He 
resigned his Washington post 
last year in protest against the 
“totalitarian” policies of the Diem 
government. He argued for a 
union of all anti-Communist 
forces to replace the religious and 
^military strife in his country.
At the assembly, Dr. Chuong 
will discuss the background of 
Diem’s overthrow and the future 
of the Vietnamese struggle against 
Communism. His appearance on 
the Tech campus is one of sev­
eral programs focused on the im­
portant national and international 
issues in this election year.

Firebug Flees 
Blaze At Dorm
by Joe Califf
Residents of Donner Hall saw 
an arsonist escaping up the hill 
behind the dormitory following an 
explosion at 10:40 p.m. Friday. 
Below, a pile of gasoline-soaked 
refuse was dicovered on the track 
in flames.
The pile had been placed there 
for a bonfire to be used in the pep 
rally that night. The rally was not 
held at the field because of bad 
weather and a Pittsburgh ordi­
nance against fires.
The fire was extinguished by the 
local fire department. Security 
Police were unable to catch the 
person believed to have started 
the fire.

Tech Registers 
846 Freshmen
by Marilyn Fox
Eight hundred and forty-six 
freshmen have registered for the 
fall semester of 1964.
According to Mr. Kenneth Wen­
ger, Dean of Admissions, approx­
imately 75 per cent of them are 
from the eastern states. Many 
new students are from California, 
Arizona and Wyoming.
There are 401 freshmen regis­
tered in Science, 240 in Fine 
Arts, 194 in Margaret Morrison, 
and 11 in Industrial Management, 
according to William L. Rogers, 
Registrar.
In the freshman class, there are 
about a dozen National Merit 
Scholars and ten George Westing- 
house Scholars.
Few students are in Engineer­
ing and Science with SAT scores 
below 500 (verbal) or below 600 
(math), according to Wenger. Of 
the new E & S students, 95 per 
cent graduated from the top 1/5 
of their high school classes.
Need Of Administrator
Stifles Drama Center
by Cindy Morse
Plans for construction of the proposed Dramatic Arts 
Center have been brought to a temporary standstill due to 
the lack of an administrative head for the Department of 
Drama. ?-----------------------------------------------------
The former head of the depart­
ment, Dr. Robert Corrigan, had 
resigned last spring. He is now 
a professor at New York Uni­
versity and editor of Nation Mag­
azine. Professor Earl Gister is 
the acting head of the drama 
department.
As a result, problems in build­
ing design, space, programming 
and future adaptability are yet 
to be resolved.
One million dollars of the nec­
essary three and a half million 
dollars has already been obtained 
for the building.
The former plan was to re­
quest bids at the end of Feb­
ruary, but it is doubtful that this 
can be accomplished.
The Dramatic Arts Building is 
the last project slated for com­
pletion under the Carnegie Ex­
pansion Program begun in 1957.
Freshmen Stage Rebellion;
Traditions Test Futile
by Evan M. Melhade
Carnegie Tech freshmen staged a rebellion against the 
Traditions Test which was held at 11 a.m. Saturday morning 
in Skibo Gym. ?------------------------------------------------
Perlis Named 
To Committee
by Jane SehoenfeldDr. Alan Perlis, Professor of 
Mathematics and director of the 
computation center at Carnegie 
Tech, has been appointed to serve 
on a committee for automatic lan­
guage processing. The appoint­
ment came through the National 
Academy of Sciences’ National 
Research Council.
Serving with Dr. John R. Pierce 
of the Bell Telephone laborator­
ies, Dr. Perlis will work with 
linguists, mathematicians, and 
computer specialists to study the 
application of electronic compu­
ters in the automatic processing 
of language data. In addition, he 
will be concerned with the me­
chanical translation of foreign 
languages, automatic abstracting, 
indexing and scanning of foreign 
language texts, a n d developing 
equipment for photo composition.

The first sign of discontent oc­
curred at 6 a.m. Saturday when 
a small group of freshmen paint­
ed the senior fence. They wrote: 
“Violets are blue, Roses are red, 
Forget the Traditions Test, Stay 
in bed.”
Scimitars, the proctors of the 
test, had taken precautionary steps 
to prevent a freshman uprising. 
The test was held indoors at 
Skibo Gym to prevent freshmen 
from building a bonfire with the 
tests. This was done last year.
Scimitars also sneaked the tests 
into the gym through the back 
door to prevent their being in­
tercepted and destroyed enroute.
The freshmen filed orderly in­
to the gym and took their places
on the floor. A few, however, 
stomped their feet and felled as 
the tests were passed out.
After the exams were dis­
tributed, one freshman jumped 
up and blew a whistle. This was 
the signal. Everything broke into 
chaos as the freshmen began to 
tear and scatter the tests.
Scimitars steered the rebelling 
freshmen out of the building to 
prevent damage to the gym equip­
ment. They also made one at­
tempt to retaliate by throwing a 
freshman into Westinghouse Pond. 
This failed.
Following the rebellion, which 
lasted about forty-five minutes, a 
group of freshmen gathered at the 
senior fence.

Editorials
Longer Library Hours Needed
A student is here at Carnegie Tech for any number of 
reasons; but we will optimistically assume that he is here 
primarily for an education.
He who seeks higher education must be willing to devote 
his efforts, his time, his concern to knowledge, to study, to 
thought. Given such a student — and we have many here 
at Tech — it is the responsibility of a college to provide 
him with every opportunity to learn. This is, indeed, a fun­
damental purpose of a university.
It is the library which should function as the central 
core of any college which honestly strives to fulfull this 
purpose.
Where else can a student go for the materials and for 
the solitude necessary for his studies? The wealth of infor­
mation available at the Hunt Library enables students to 
prepare themselves adequately for any academic course, for 
any lecture or discussion. This is not, however, the only 
function of a library.
Instruction and class discussion are vitally important in 
the search for knowledge, but educators and psychologists 
will attest to the fact that independent discovery is also one 
of the most meaningful elements in the learning process. And 
the place where the student should be able to pursue his own 
academic interests, his own ideas, the answers to his own 
questions, should be the library. The facilities are there.
The crucial issue is, are the facilities there when the 
student needs them?
The answer is, unfortunately, NO.
According to the present schedule, the Hunt Library is 
opened week-days from 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturday, 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. and Sunday, 2 to 10 p.m. These hours are only ade­
quate when one wishes to complete short assignments, or 
plans some quick studying during free hours.
But these hours do not provide amply study time for the 
student whose schedule requires that intensive work be done 
in the morning before classes, or as most often happens, in 
the evening.
The plight of the evening school student must also be 
considered. He needs the library when his classes are over, 
often at 9 or 10 at night.
A proposed schedule, one which would comply with the 
needs of such students, is as follows: Monday through Friday 
from 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and 
Sunday, 2 to 10 p.m.
The early week-day hours would enable many students 
to put in some solid work before classes begin: those two 
hours from 7:30 to 9:30 could be invaluable to a students 
whose schedule begins at 9:30 and is full throughout the day. 
An extension of the opening hour was instituted last year 
with which students proved their interest in early studying. 
(Just look around the Reserve Room at 8:15 in the morning.)
The benefits of longer evening hours need not be enum­
erated. Students study long after 9 p.m. Why shouldn’t study 
facilities accommodate them?
The time for change is now, before the school year rou­
tine is irrevocably established, and the search begins for a 
place to study when the time for studying is right!

fessing the conservative point of 
view, have a mistaken notion of 
Conservatism.
This fact deems necessary the 
study of not only Senator Gold­
water’s views, but those of con­
servative thinkers before him. To 
reach this end, I will draw on the 
writings of other conservatives 
and try to present a “composite” 
view of Conservatism.
First of all, one must under­
stand the nature of man in or­
der to adapt a political phil­
osophy which will serve him best. 
Man is basically an evil 
creature, and his wickedness 
and irrationality must be held 
in check by the restraints ef 
an orderly society. To attain 
this society, an aristocracy 
ust rule the people,, keeping 
in mind that equality is sec­
ondary to liberty.
The rights of man must be 
earned — even the inalienable 
rights of the Constitution — by 
the performance of certain du­
ties. “Service, effort, obedience, 
cultivation of virtue, self- re­
straint,” all are the price of 
rights according to Rossiter.
To conservatives, the solu­
tion to problems is not pur­
poseful reform, but reliance on 
the simple, instinctive acts of 
traditionalism and preservation. 
Education — family, church, 
and school — is stressed as 
the main way in which chil­
dren can be shaped into civi­
lized men. This outside influ­
ence upon man is the “only” 
way in which man’s vices can 
be brought under control.
The conservative also arrives 
at desired views of man, society, 
and government. A good man is 
self-disciplined, reverent, prudent, 
patrotic, and contented. A good 
society is orderly, united, equal, 
stable, secure, harmonious, and 
changes only when absolutely 
necessary. A good government is 
dignified, legitimate, just, con 
stitutional, hierarchal, and has 
limited powers. Conservatism is 
all this: a temperment, a mood, 
a philosophy, and a tradition. 
Senator’s Goldwater’s ideas 
on Conservatism are much the 
same as the previous conser­
vatives, but one important dif­
ference exists. According to 
Senator Goldwater, in “The 
Conscience of a Conservative,” 
Conservatism takes into ac­
count the wholeness of man’s 
nature. It accounts for both the 
spiritual and material sides of 
man’s nature. Realizing both of 
these extremes allows the con­
servative to rationalize the 
presence of both individuality 
and equality.
The mortal side of man’s soul 
establishes his uniqueness while 
all men have an equal chance 
for spiritual immortality. Sena­
tor Goldwater states that “man’s 
development, in both its spirit­
ual and material aspects, is not 
something that can be directed 
by outside forces.” This shines 
through as the major premise of 
Goldwater’s argument.
From this can be extended that 
man is solely responsible for 
both his spiritual and material 
needs. This is radically different 
from the reliance of other con­
servatives on education to di­
erases such Institutions as 
schools, churches, labor unions, 
and even the government of 
our society. Thus, Senator 
Goldwater’s theory tends to 
collapse and it definitely needs 
to be clarified.
It is not only this unique fea­
ture of Senator Goldwater’s the­
ories which makes him unfit for
the Presidency but also other un­
acceptable conservative beliefs. 
Probably the biggest is the be­
lief that “this is the best of all 
possible worlds,” as Clinton Ros­
siter phrases it, and the general 
contention to leave well enough 
alone.
In Voltaire’s “Candide,” Can- 
dide’s naive belief that this is 
the best of all possible worlds is 
satirically destroyed. The conclu­
sion one comes to is that many 
evils are avoidable, especially 
those caused by ignorance and 
fanaticism, and that change is 
a means to this end.
This contradiction of con­
servative belief, that a dynamic 
society cannot be treated in a 
static manner, is the major 
reason why Senator Goldwa­
ter’s theories will not solve the 
problems which our society 
faces.
Politics
Dems Hit On Policy
Of Nat’l Values By GOP
by Robert ). Fritz
Depending upon whether you are left wing, right wing, 
or no wing at all, you might describe Barry Goldwater as 
a nuclear madman, the savior of our country, or a fool. But
regardless of who you are, the^-----------------------------------------------------
best description of him is con­
tained in the word “protest,” a 
protest that was fated to occur 
the day the New Deal replaced 
Herbert Hoover.
It is easy to look with some 
nostalgia upon the past—upon the 
heroic pioneer, alone with his 
family in a savage wilderness, and 
the self-sufficient craftsman who 
forged our nation with his brains, 
his hands, and his initiative. Then 
there used to be a certain solemn 
patriotism, on days like the Fourth 
of July, and the flag which was 
resolutely respected, if not liked, 
everywhere on the globe.
Now there are those who fear 
that all our old values have disin­
tegrated, that “our lives, our for­
tunes, and our sacred honor” are 
in danger of being subjugated by 
a very real form of dictatorship, 
an increasingly complex federal 
government which threatens to 
extend its hand into every facet 
of our lives.
The most vocal of these is 
Barry Goldwater, and his voice 
is chiefly protest. He speaks 
copiously about the so-called 
issues of Viet Nam, Cuba, nu­
clear weapons, and the like. But 
these are only transient issues. 
There are two more meaningful 
issues: Must our national values 
change with our technology, and 
should they? The conservatives 
answer, “no,” to both questions, 
and this is the essence of the pro­
test that is Goldwater.
Just how effective this protest 
will be is somewhat question­
able. Unfortunately the “real” 
issues will not play much of a 
part in deciding the election, as 
the Senator’s unpopular image 
alone is enough to ensure his 
defeat in November.
It is becoming ever more ap­
parent that the conservatives, in 
choosing their champion, have by­
passed all the best knights, to 
choose instead the one with the 
loudest voice.
And Lyndon Johnson is a for­
midable foe indeed. His prom­
ises of prosperity go out to all 
men. To the farmer he is the 
drawling log-cabin bom Texas 
rancher. The union worker sees 
him as one of the original new 
dealers, and to the businessman 
he shows his kindly paternalis­
tic side.
The Johnson dream is of an 
affluent society in which every­
one is contented and all work to­
gether, and while he has been 
called conservative (among other 
things), he believes that the fed­
eral government is the best agent 
to bring this society about.
Ignoring the conservatives, he 
sees no governmental threat to de­
mocracy, our way of life, or any­
thing else. Since assuming office 
last November Johnson has been 
extremely effective at getting what 
he wants. In these ten short 
months his popularity has in­
creased to a higher level than that 
of any other president in modern 
history. A Johnson victory is al­
most a foregone conclusion.
Now we are faced with a para­
dox. The very man who es­
pouses conservatism the most, 
and has finally given the voters 
“a choice, not an echo,” has, by 
his somewhat irresponsible 
statements, his continually 
changing views, and his vote on 
the Civil Rights Bill, among 
other things, doomed the chances 
of conservatism in 1964. Pessim­
ists among conservatives, and 
optimists among liberals, have 
predicted that it will never be 
an issue again. But this is hard 
to believe.
Our nation has undeniably 
moved toward the left in recent 
years, whether for better or for 
worse. This has given rise to con­
servatism.
If Johnson wins in 1964, the pro­
test will continue, with or without 
Goldwater. Eventually a conser­
vative with the political cunning 
of Lyndon Johnson will run for 
President. That election will de­
cide the fate of mankind for a long 
time.

‘Student Government
Is A Catalyst For Action9
by Joseph G. Sandulli
Chairman of Student Congress 
Is anybody going home for Thanksgiving vacation this 
year? Don’t take it for granted; last year the school scheduled 
classes for the Friday following this Thanksgiving. Through 
^negotiation and even promise of a student demonstration, 
Student Congress convinced the administration to re-instate
Friday after Thanksgiving as a#----------------------------------------------------
vacation. With a record of this 
kind of action, Student Congress 
attacks another year.
I am pleased to begin this year 
with a crew of dynamic enthu­
siastic committee heads who will 
actually carry out the doings of 
Congress. Already Dick Elder has 
raised the freshmen to a higher 
^ degree of orientation than ever 
before. We expect “dinks” still 
to be fashionable at Christmas 
time. Dick is, of course, the Ori­
entation Committee Chairman of 
Congress; he has had complete 
responsibility for planning and 
carrying out every orientation 
event following Freshman Camp.
Establish Flans 
At our first Congress meeting 
©n September 30, we will begin 
^to establish plans for this year’s
action. Mike Gross and Bob Fritz 
of General Campus Committee 
will present their ideas on a new 
school calendar which would al­
low us to finish first semester 
by Christmas and second semes­
ter by early May. They will soon 
begin to negotiate for this cal­
endar change.
Our Assembly Committee 
headed by Joe Bowman with its 
new $4,000 budget (an increase 
of $3,000 over last year) has al­
ready lined up Drew Pearson who 
will analyze the coming presi­
dential election. Joe is still de­
bating whether he can safely 
bring Ross Barnett to Carnegie 
Tech.
Favorite Project
Of all the new projects, my 
favorite is the idea of our writ­
ing a “Course Critique”: effec­
tively a course catalogue writ­
ten by the students. Modeled af­
ter such a book published at 
Yale, its intent would be to de­
scribe courses as the students see 
them; to help students find a 
course and prof better suited to 
their needs; not just to criticize. 
No more people taking “Analysis” 
and expecting a course in psy­
chiatry.
In an attempt to see that Con­
gress more fairly represents the 
student body, our new Elections 
Committee chairman, Dick Lon- 
dergan will be examining the
representational structure of Con­
gress so that all student opinions 
can be heard more easily. Dick 
may also help run a mock elec­
tion of Gold water vs. Johnson 
depending upon how active young 
Democrats and Republicans are 
on our campus.
Skibo For Students
Elissa Parker and Tom Johnson 
have some marvelous plans for 
making Skibo more cozy, more 
social. They will begin negotia­
tions for turning Skibo into a 
place where one can bring a 
date, and even dance. They want 
more of the space there turned 
back over to the students.
And, of course, there will be 
the things we take for granted 
from Student Congress like Home­
coming and Spring Carnival. 
Keith Pierce will be doing his 
most important work in this next 
month before Homecoming, for 
which he will be completely re­
sponsible.
We try to think creatively and 
to improve continually the status 
of the student on this campus, in 
addition to maintaining all the 
basic necessities of life like big 
weekends and vacations. To per­
ceive what you consider as an 
improvement on campus we must 
maintain good communication 
with the entire student body.
Meetings Open 
If you have an inspiration, con­
tact me and then come to the
next Congress meeting; I will see 
that your idea is considered. Our 
first meeting is open to everyone 
on campus. Just come to watch, 
or fill out a sheet requesting work 
with one of the committees. Stu­
dent Congress is no miracle cure 
for your problems.
If you have a problem, siga 
up for Congress, and YOU will 
solve the problem. Congress is 
the catalyst for action with its 
budget of $4,200 and its organi­
zation of over 100 people who 
have the enthusiasm and ability 
to accomplish things.

SPORTS
Opener Sees Tech Plummet
Under Mighty Westminister, 39-0
The PAT
was now
by Ron Bidula
In spite of new uniforms and several new faces in the
lineup for CIT last Saturday at Tech Field, it was the same
old story as far as the football fortunes of Carnegie Tech 
are concerned. The Westminster Titans soundly thrashed the 
Tartans to the tune of 39-0. ? ——
Tech simply couldn’t cope with 
the unusual depth in the Titans’ 
offensive and defensive lines.
Tech’s experienced backfield could 
not consistently jell to produce
the long gainers necessary if the
wide-open offense displayed by 
the Techites was to prevail.
Tech won the toss and elect­
ed to open up their offense on 
their first plays from scrim­
mage. After D’Appolonia cov­
ered a short kick on his own 
S3, Wisniewski tested right 
guard for a short gain before he 
pitched out to Gilchrist around 
right end for four yards and 
then tossed a long but errant 
bomb downfield trying to hit 
D’Appolonia, who had eluded 
the speedy Titan secondary.
Tech was then forced to punt 
from their 38.
CIT contained the cautious 
Titan offense for the moment, 
however, and Westminster punted 
to the Tech 32, where freshman 
Dick Bell gathered in the slip­
pery pigskin and fought his way 
back to the 38. Then the Tech 
offense caught fire for the mo­
ment.
After an incomplete pass and 
a short gain on a cross-buck by 
fullback Dick Merrill, Wis 
faked to his fullback and threw 
a screen pass to sophomore 
halfback, Gilchrist, who scam­
pered 32 yards around left end 
to the enemy’s 28. Dave was 
shaken up by a hard tackle, 
however, and was replaced in 
the backfield by frosh John 
Barth.
The Titans quickly ended any 
hopes for -a quick Tech score, 
however, as they stopped Barth 
for a loss after a pitchout from 
Wis, and then forced the harried 
quarterback to overthrow his 
targets twice. On fourth down 
they stopped a Statue of Liberty 
Play for no gain.
Westminster took over with 
8:23 left in the first quarter and 
politely fumbled the ball right 
back to the Tartans on the WM 
28, but Tech still could not 
come up with a score. After 
two pitchouts and a fullback 
plunge over right tackle left 
CIT still short of a first down,
Wis called for a quickie but­
tonhook, but he threw behind 
his receiver and WM took over 
on downs.
After again forcing a Titan 
punt to the CIT 44, Tech mounted 
a sustained drive toward the 
Titan goal line with the hard 
running of Dick Merrill and the 
sure hands of halfback Jim Black! 
and D'Appolonia. This threat wasj 
stymied though when Titan Bob,
Scarazzo intercepted a Wis pass; 
on his own 5 and returned it to! 
the WM 31. With about a minute j 
left in the quarter, that was the* 
ballgame as far as the Tech fans! 
were concerned.
On the next play Smitty Cor-j 
nell circled left end to the CIT;
27. The Titans pounded the CITj 
guard and tackle positions until;
Harry James plunged over from | 
one yard out with 14:05 left in | 
tha second period. The PAT was; 
good and the Titans led 7-0.
!Then, after Westminster quick­
ly forced Tech to punt to the WM; 
tl, John Bailey, Titan halfback 
from Pittsburgh Schenley, quick-! 
ly cut over left tackle and outran i 
hapless CIT svvvudiui Iw <*i|
Titan score at 11:22. 
was short and Tech 
trailing 13-0.
Tech returned the kiekoff to 
its 38 and gained a first down 
with the hard running of frosh 
Barth. WTis was shaken up on 
the next play and freshman 
Tom Hubka took over. Three 
plays later a Gilchrist punt was 
blocked and recovered by WM 
on the CIT 31.
The Titans quickly passed to 
the Tech 5, but the rugged Tech 
forward wall held for four downs, 
only to see Wis fumble the ball 
back to the enemy on the next 
play. Bailey quickly scored again 
and WM led 19-0 at 4:18 after the 
PAT failed. Neither team could 
mount a drive in the last four 
minutes of the half as they ex­
changed punts.
The rainsoaked crowd was 
entertained at halftime by the 
Scottish Highland dancing of 
freshman Sarah Jane Erskine 
and the frosh-soph tug-of-war. 
The weak-kneed freshmen had 
to enlist the aid of the South 
goal post to win their struggle 
and attempted to become the 
first in the history of the grid­
iron sport to tear down a goal­
post at halftime. The sober­
headed sophomores prevailed, 
though.
CIT kicked off to open the sec­
ond half and WM returned to 
their 30. On the first play from 
scrimmage Gig Armstrong scoot­
ed around the CIT left end for 
70 quick yards and another Titan 
score at 14:11. The PAT was off 
to the right and CIT was now 
down 25-0.
Tech blockers could no long­
er hold back the onrushing
Titan defensemen. Gilchrist 
punted on fourth and twenty - 
nine at the CIT 3 and WM re­
turned to the Tech 38. Tech
fans took heart two plays later 
as Dick Merrill stole a Titan 
aerial on his own 33 and
hustled all the way to the WM
30. Two plays later, however, 
Gary Hughes snatched a Wis­
niewski pass on his 30 and ran 
all the way to paydirt for the 
fifth Westminster TD. This time 
the PAT was good and CIT
trained 32-0 at 7:26.
The Titans again forced Tech to 
punt after only three short run­
ning gains and then ground out 
the yardage from their 40 to­
wards the CIT end zone with 
halfbacks Haug and Smargiasso 
carrfing the load. As the third 
quarter ended, however, soph 
guard Pete Gair covered a WM 
fumble at the CIT 14. Two plays 
later defensive end Ray Cebula 
plucked a Hubka aerial from the 
hands of a frustrated Tech re­
ceiver and scored the sixth Titan 
TD. WM again split the uprights 
and now led' 39-0 with about 
fourteen minutes left in the 
“game.”
The two teams went through 
the motions as the slick field 
and first game mistakes by both 
teams prevented any prolonged 
drive. The Titans continually 
smeared Tech runners for loss­
es as Coach Gasparella was 
now experimenting with an all- 
freshman backfield.
The gloom was thick in the CIT 
lockerroom after the game. Tech 
fans are hoping their discouraged 
gladiators will bounce back 
against Wooster next Saturday.
Frosh Turn 
Tug Into Win
by Bruce Gelin
Tech freshmen won the right to 
remove their “dinks” as they out- 
pulled the sophomores in the tra­
ditional tug of war last Saturday 
afternoon on the Tech field.
Having successfully revolted 
against the traditions test in the 
morning, the freshmen set out to 
make a clean sweep of the class 
conflict. During halftime of the 
Tech-Westminster football game, 
the sides gathered at each end of 
the rope, the frosh pulling toward 
the south goalpost.
Making headway from the 
start, the frosh used a new tactic, 
pulling the rope around the up­
right of the goalpost. Both the post 
and the sophomore team gave in, 
with the freshmen holding the 
dubious title of victors.

1926-Big Year
by Howard WeissThe 1926 powerhouse team, 
under Coach “Wally” Seffen, 
started off favorably with a 
47-0 romp over Adrian. Then 
we lost a htartbreaker to 
arch-rivals Washington & Jef­
ferson with a score of 17-6, 
but we came back to beat Pitt 
14-0 and Detroit 7-0 for the 
city championship.
Powerful N.Y.U. edged us 
6-0 but we rebounded with 
52-0 and 20-0 victories over 
Juniata and West Virginia, re­
spectively.
Then came the final game of 
the season. The 1925 Rose 
Bowl winner, Notre Dame, 
unbeaten in eleven matches 
and coached by Knute Rockne, 
was our foe.
The outcome was the biggest 
upset in football history! The 
Tartans humbled “The Fight­
ing Irish” 19-0.
