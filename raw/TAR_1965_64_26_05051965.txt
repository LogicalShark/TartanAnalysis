Bab Fritz, junior, physics, has 
been elected president of the 
Councic of Fraternity Presidents 
(CFP).
He served this past year as 
chairman of the Activities Com­
mittee of Student Congress.
Fritz is a member of Sigma 
Nu fraternity, and Omicron Delta 
Kappa, senior men’s ho orary. He 
is captaii of the rifle team.
Other officers elected were: 
Mariot Baumai TDP, administra­
tive vice president; Curt Chand­
ler, BTP, executive vjce-presi-
dent; Ed Jesteadt, PKT, treasurer, 
Dick Eckhardt, SN, secretary.
CFP is the governing body of 
the Fraternity system.
Composed of a junior represen­
tative and the president of each 
house, it meets bi-weekly to dis­
cuss and make recommendations 
for the maintenance of a strong 
fraternity system.
The council also sponsors a 
number of social events, such as 
Greek Sing and Greek Week.
According to Fritz, “the biggest 
immediate problem before the 
council is rush. The large num­
ber of freshman pledged this year, 
coupled with the experience 
gained in Carnegie Tech’s first 
deferred rush in recent years, has 
lead CFP to set a goal of 250 
pledges for next year.”
Other CFP projects will include 
an orientation pamphlet to assist 
newly-elected fraternity officers 
and a careful review of school 
policies concerning fraternities.
The new officers have been 
meeting to determine “how best 
to increase the effectiveness of 
the council.”
Subsequently they have pledged 
themselves to communicate more 
effectively with the student body 
and ofther student governing 
bodies, such as Pan-hellenic 
Council and men’s and women’s 
dormitory councils.
Pi Delta Epsilon, national 
journalism honorary, held its an­
nual dinner on April 26.
The following students were in­
ducted into the honorary: Sut At- 
tinson, sophomore, technical writ­
ing; Judy Birken, sophomore, in­
dustrial management; Barbara 
Brown, junior, biology; Diane 
Hayduk, junior, biology; David 
Klein, sophomore, engineer; 
Marty Kline, sophomore engineer;

Lasnik, sophomore, math; Rich 
Sextro, sophomore, chemistry; 
Jane Schoenfeld, sophomore, 
physics; Rosemary Hines, sopho­
more, biology; and Richara Dip- 
polito, senior, engineer.

Cites Plans For Improvement
Spring Carnival Midway Plan
by Liz Seley
( The Spring Carnival midway will be lined with booths 
representing the twelve fraternities on the Carnegie Tech 
campus. In addition, the men’s dormitory and sororities will 
also construct booths fo rthe fair.
The booths are being built to’ 
correspond to Carnival’s roaring 
twenties theme.
Tau Delta Phi fraternity has 
chosen Charles A. Lindberg’s his­
toric flight to provide carnical 
goers with the opportunity to 
“Help Chuckie Span the Ocean 
CgSlue.”
The brothers of Beta Theta Pi
fraternity will draw attention to 
an “Uncanny Drowning in a 
Pittsburgh Warehouse.” A search 
by F. B. I. agents of the ware- 
. house which is operating an il­
legal still, results in the brew- 
master’s death. Coroners upon in­
vestigation, however, question the 
cause of death: drowning or . . . 
alcoholic consumption.
By creating the “biggest pin 
ball machine in the world,” the 
brothers of Sigma Nu plan to give 
students, faculty and visitors the 
chance to experience all the ex­
citement of a roaring twenties 
.robbery and the ensuing chase, 
v# The Kappa Sigma fraternity 
booth will involve a gang of hood­
lums and their chase of a few 
hillbilly moonshiners in Ken­
tucky.
Alpha Tau Omega’s theme is a
speakeasy raid in which meer is 
poured on a bartender’s head. On­
lookers will participate in the raid 
by throwing beer bottles at the
Phi Kappa Theta fraternity will 
display.
urge persons to help the stock 
market crash of 1929. Onlookers 
will be able to prevent the bear 
from running hampant on Wall 
Street with blue-chip stocks as 
ammunition.
The stamping out of illegal al­
cohol will be urged by President 
Calvin Steverledge and the broth­
ers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fra­
ternity. A raid will be expected at 
any time during May 6-9 at the 
“Shoot-a-Brew” brewery. Those 
taking part in the raid will be 
offered rewards.
The brothers of Delta Tau Delta 
fraternity will greet prohibition at 
their booth with a wide variety 
and great quantity of alcoholic 
treats.
Beta Sigma Rho fraternity asks, 
“Will Babe Ruth hit his 60th?” 
Carnivalgoers will be able to as­
sist “the Babe” in hitting it out 
of the Yankee park.
The Delta Upsilon Stock Mar­
ket will present the opportunity 
to speculate in active business 
trading and to be a winner in the 
unique “rat race.”
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity will 
offer carnival goers entertainment 
in the vaudeville style. All one 
will need do to win will be to 
cast a hat into the dance area.
The Ziegfeld Follies will be re­
called by the brothers of Theta Xi 
who propose the theme of mil­
lionaire Dan Caswell and how he 
tossed diamonds at the Follies 
girls.
The sororities will re-create the 
roaring twenties in booths built

Richard A. Elder, junior physics, was elected chairman of Student Congress in a 
meeting held April 28. Joe Orens, sophomore, engineer, was elected vice chairman.
In his statement to Congress, 
Elder stressed the importance of 
revising the constitution to define 
the duties of the Student Court 
and Executive Council.
He said that in his administra­
tion, Congress members will be 
familiarized with proposals be­
fore meetings through bulletins, 
and will therefore be able to dis­
cuss and criticize with as much 
knowledge as possible.
He stated that he will expect 
members to work to full capacity.
Elder proposed to institute a 
study of the budget, and in par­
ticular a study of the activities 
debt.

1965-66 Members
The sophomore men’s scholastic 
and activities honorary has an­
nounced the following new Sci­
mitars for 1965-66.
The new members are: Bob

Rose, Vance Rutnan, Mark Silver, 
Les Silverman, Richards Stein- 
bock, and George Wram.
These students were selected on 
the basis of both factor and ex­
tracurricular activities.
Other proposals were to re­
search a possible enlarging of or 
revision of the uess of Carnegie 
Tech’s student union and to sub­
sidize athletic trips with “excess 
budget.”
Elder also mentioned a “busi­
ness managar’s reference guide,” 
for use by Carnegie Tech’s pub­
lications.
He stressed the need for full 
cooperation and support of the 
student body and administration. 
Elder stated that “the Tartan is 
not used to potential,” and hopes 
that this state of affairs will be 
changed next year.
In addition to the election re­
sults, it was announced at the 
Congress meeting that Eugene 
Milich, assistant dean of men, wrill 
replace Dale E. Strick as coordi­
nator of student activities.

S’nS Comes of Age
In 1965 Production
t -----------by Martha Hodgson
It is not what the audience 
expected to see from Scotch and 
Soda, it does not end with the 
whole cast on stage in a huge 
production number, it does not 
even end happily (although in 
places, and in the ending, it is 
strangely reminiscent of two 
other musicals, Gypsy and Funny 
Girl), and it could almost be said 
to be great.
At least, it is more than a lot 
of colorful costumes, pink and 
blue sets that roll, a string of 
lights marked “White Bam Thea­
ter” and “Central Catholic” and
See Pictures, Page 5
a lot of enthusiastic people with 
circles under their eyes and fall­
ing factors. Scotch and Soda seems 
to have come of age; it has 
grown up.
Of course, theie are still ob­
vious relics of its adolescence. 
In fact, the whole first act is 
just the kind of pizazz that is 
SnS’ trademark, or was. The her­
oine just can’t sing, period, but 
what comes out when she tries 
is almost as bad/good as the 
strange noises that come from 
Barbara Streisand.
The technical end, because it 
was opening night, was ghastly; 
hopefully, the light crew will 
learn its cues by Thursday night.
Most of the rest oi the show I 
is masterful, partly by accident j 
and partly by somebody’s idea. 
The music is really superb, the 
chorus numbers amazingly good 
if not technically perfect (in fact, 
any number with 3 or more peo­
ple in it gets off the ground and 
runs) and the dark horse of the 
evening is Sue Martin, who belts 
out her one number, which is 
musically the worst in the show, 
with a feeling and depth that is 
kind of wonderful.
If there were an oscar for
dancing, Dave Altman should 
have it; in the TV production 
number, that blur is he. One of 
the best numbers is also one of 
the funniest, Becky and Bill Bur- 
dett in “You’ll Have Me All Day 
Long.”
The band is probably the best 
in the history of S’nS, possibly 
due to some excellent orchestrat­
ing, which includes a technique, 
very effectively utilized, of using 
some of the better numbers as 
transitional and introductory se­
quences.
Becky Smith’s four solos, strik­
ingly staged, would not make it 
if it weren't Becky Smith sing­
ing them. The show is built 
around her, and was written 
around her. It was a good idea.
Grad Presents 
One-Man Show
by Candy Etkin
The Museum of Art, Carnegie 
Institute, is presenting a one-man 
exhibit of paintings by the Pitts­
burgh artist, Edwin Zoller.
Zoller received his B.A. degree 
from Penn State and continued 
his post-graduate studies in fine 
arts for three years at Carnegie 
Tech. He also studied in Flor­
ence, Paris and Mexico.
Last year, Zoller’s painting “No. 
7-64” was awarded the Carnegie 
Institute Purchase Prize in the 
55th annual exhibit of the As­
sociated Artists of Pittsburgh. | 
This spring, one of his oils, titled, 
“No. 10-64” was presented a Jury 
Award for Distinction.
The exhibit will be shown in 
gallery K through May 23.
The gallery will be open from 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., weekdays, and 
from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.

Page 4 — CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN — Wednesday, May 5, 1965
Editorial -"I\ Independents: 
Meet Carnival
The Tartan recently conducted an investigation of stu­
dent response to the upcoming Spring Carnival Weekend. In 
answer to this inquiry, David J. Ritchie, vice president of 
Men’s Dormitory Council, stated, “The response to Carnival 
among indepenedents in the dormitories has proved to be 
very disappointing.”
In fact, the independents have displayed only minimal 
interest and enthusiasm with regard to Carnival. Out of 680 
students in the dormitories, of whom the vast majority is 
composed of independents, forty to fifty have bought Carnival 
tickets. Mr. Ritchie does not expect this total to rise above 
sixty. Discussions with several ticket salesmen in the dormi­
tories indicate that the average salesman has been able to 
sell only four to six tickets.
It seems surprising that the anticipation of Carnival on 
the part of the independents has been characterized by such 
widespread apathy. Indeed, this year Carnival promises to 
be an outstanding campus affair.
In response to student demands, the Carnival Committee, 
chaired by Richard L. Elkman, senior in graphic arts, has 
introduced a number of substantial improvements into the 
Carnival events. Operating this year on a nine thousand 
dollar budget, as opposed the five thousand dollar budget of 
the previous year, the Carnival Committee has arranged a 
concert by the well-known Chad Mitchell Trio; it has planned 
the largest Carnival Midway yet, including three rides; it has 
provided live bands to perform on the Midway throughout 
the weekend; it has arranged Saturday afternoon entertain­
ment on the tennis courts; and, finally, it will award more 
trophies than have ever before been awarded at Carnival.
Why, then, in light of these facts, have the independents 
displayed only minimal interest in Carnival?
Some independents complain that the ten dollar price 
of the tickets is too high. This is certainly an invalid com­
plaint. Ten dollars is hardly an extravagant amount to pay 
to provide a couple with good entertainment for a weekend 
which lasts more than three days.
Others protest that the Carnival is, in essence, solely a 
fraternity affair. This criticism is an equally invalid one. Mr. 
Elkman’s committee began its publicity campaign in the dor­
mitories a full week before the publicity reached the frater­
nity houses. It also initiated ticket sales in the dormitories a 
week in advance.
Furthermore, Men’s Dormitory Council is building a 
Midway Booth, and has entered the Buggy Sweepstakes. In 
addition the Dormitory Council is sponsoring two parties 
after the Carnival activities, on Friday and Saturday nights. 
The independents most certainly have been provided with 
more than ample means to fully enjoy Carnival.
If Carnival does indeed appear to be solely a frater­
nity affair, it is the lack of participation on the part of 
the independents that has made it so.
The Tartan urges all students, and particularly indepen­
dents, to participate fully in Carnival, to enjoy themselves 
over the Carnival Weekend, and to make Carnival a success­
ful all-campus event.

William Chadboume Mitchell, 
the 28-year-old singer who 
founded the Chad Mitchell Trio 
six years ago and helped to make 
it one of the country’s most suc­
cessful folk-singing groups is 
leavisg the trio to make his act­
ing debut on Broadway.
The singing group changed its 
name to the Mitchell Trio last 
year so that Mr. Mitchell’s bill­
ing would not overshadow his 
confreres, Mike Kobluk and Joe 
Frazier. Mr. Kobluk and Mr. 
Frazier plan to hire a replace­
ment soon and continue as the 
Mitchell Trio.
Mr. Mitchell will have a ma­
jor part in “Postmark Zero,” 
Robert Nemiroff’s adaptation of 
“Last Letters from Stalingrad,” 
a collection of writings of Nazi 
soldiers trapped in Stalingrad 
during World War II.
The book was published here 
by William Marrow and Co. It 
was originally issued in Germany 
in 1954. Some of the letters re­
veal unreconstructed Nazis; other 
discolse tenderness, sorrow and 
disgust.
Peter Coe will direct the play, 
which is scheduled to open in 
October. Others in the cast are
Jean Pierre Aumont, Martin Bal­
sam, Janice Rule, and Alida 
Valli. Mr. Nemiroff and Burt C. 
D’Lugoff are the producers.
Mr. Mitchell and the other act­
ors will each portray several roles.
Interviewed yesterday in Mr. 
Nemiroff’s office at 137 West 52nd 
Street, Mr. Mitchell, a blond, per­
sonable man in a sports jacket 
and slacks explained his de­
cision to quit the trio:
“I’ve been singing for six years 
and I’m honestly tired of it. It 
can be limiting. The only thing 
that changes is the material. It’s 
a natural progression to explore 
other areas of art. But I don’t 
plan to give up singing. I love 
it.”
He went on: “Our group dif­
fers from many others in that 
our approach to our material — 
we do a lot of satire approaches 
drama. In one of our pieces — 
a satire on neo-Nazism in Ger­
many, we were coached by the 
theater director Gene Frankel.”
Mr. Mitchell said he had not 
studied acting, although he has 
worked with Paul Sills, a direc­
tor and one of the founders of 
Chicago’s Second City improvi- 
sational troupe.
Two Students Object 
To Ugly Man Publicity
Editor, the Tartan:
The recent appearance of cer­
tain posters on the campus in 
support of a Campus Chest drive, 
specifially the election of an “Ugli­
est Man On Campus,” have caused 
certain students to have a kind 
of indignation; this not because 
of the aims of the Campus Chest 
Drive, but rather because they 
consider the posters obscene.
These posters are suggestive 
of something which cannot be 
called obscene by the usual le­
gal definition only because of 
the weak protection afforded by 
double meaning.
Perhaps the majority of the stu­
dents do not find these posters 
objectionable. We object to the 
references in these posters to per­
verse sexuality and promiscuity, 
references which have nothing to 
do with the relative “ugliness” of 
the candidates, unless we are to 
judge them on the basis of their 
moral ugliness, a criterion which 
we believe to be improper to the 
aims of the drive.

Tech To Hold

Brewer, clarinetist, Jean Webb, 
oboist, Roger Roth, violist, Mau­
rice McCall, violinist, Rosaline 
Johnson, pianist, and John Dex­
ter, trombonist.
Admission will be free.
PTG Selects 
New Members
Phi Tau Gamma, junior wom­
en’s activities honorary, has se­
lected its members for the 1965- 
1966 school year.
The members are Sue Attinson, 
Elizabeth Bain, Rita Bajgier, Dara 
Birnbaum, Judith Cagley, Eliza­
beth Carten, Beth Dewalt, Edith 
Dickman, Valera Dodge, Marlene 
Gaysek, Margaret L. Hays, Bar­
bara Hepner, Karen Kutner, El­
len Maher, Harriet Newman, Su­
san Lee Powers, Janet P. Reed, 
Gretchen Smith, Mary C. Stader, 
Lynn Taylor, Ruth Trackler, and 
Christine Wick.
“Bob Nemiroff approached me 
s o m e time ago,” Mr. Mitchell 
said, “and I like the idea since 
I had been thinking of acting for 
some time.”
Mr. Nemiroff added: “Part of 
it was a confluence of thinking. 
Peter Coe, our director, has been 
a fan of the trio for a long time. 
Actually, there is so much acting 
involved in the trio’s perform­
ance.”
Mr. Mitchell, who now lives in 
Chicago, was born in Portland, 
Ore. As a premedical student he 
attended Gonzaga University, in 
Spokane, Washington, which once 
had a student named Bing Crosby.
Mr. Mitchell, a member of the 
university’s glee club, said to two 
of has friends one day: “Why don’t 
we get together and sing?” They 
did and last year, traveling across 
the country and making several 
records, they grossed $500,000.

Carnival Buggy Races
by Roger Powell
Drama Dept 
To Produce 
Play By Yafa
Speculation runs high the week before race day. In 
Buggy Design, the big question is if Sigma Nu can repeat its 
of last year.victory
Last May their Lotus-style, 
large diameter-wheeled number 
three was a hit with the judges. 
Rumor has it that they were seen 
free-rolling very quickly during 
a night practice last week. There­
fore, they probably will have no 
trouble qualifying for design by 
placing in the top half of the Fri­
day time trials.
However, the competition will un­
doubtedly be close for the design 
award. It wuold not be surprising

for driver-training and may not 
see the starting line this year.

addition this year, the second

in a consolation heat on Saturday.
Also added this year are fra­

ing as Race Marshals. This was 
added due to the dangerous 
conditions resulting from inade­
quate crowd control in past 
years. The races on Saturday 
will start at 9:00 a.m., contrary 
to the time previously an­
nounced.

years and has served on the man­
agers and officials’ club.
He is a member of Beta Theta 
Pi fraternity.
He is also a member of Delta 
Skull, the junior men's honorary, 
and Tau Beta Pi, the engineering 
honorary.
Stone feels that “because the 
office of IM Board president has 
been added to the Executive 
Council of Student Congress, the 
IM Board will be brought into 
closer contact with other campus 
activities.”
He proposes to take action on 
improving the IM field and pro­
viding lighting for this area.

churches in the three neighbor­
hoods involved — Homewood- 
Brushton, Hazelwood and Perry

Pupils will be recruited by 
principals of the schools involved, 
with the permission and coopera­
tion of the parents.
This is the third summer in 
which these totoring programs 
have been held, sponsored by Ac­
tion-Housing, Inc., in cooperation 
with the Pittsburgh Board of 
Public Education, the Catholic 
Schools Office, all major local 
universities, and the Neighbor­
hood Urban Extension councils.
The program is being repeated 
this summer because of its suc­
cess in past summers. Approxi­
mately one hundred volunteers 
are expected to volunteer as 
tutors.
Action-Housing, Inc. also spon­
sors a tutorial project during the 
winter. Carnegie Tech students 
have participated in both pro­
grams.

1. Now that graduation’s getting 
close, have you given any 
thought to the kind of work 
you’d like to do?
I want to work for 
The Good of Mankind, j
2.1 might have suspected.
I’ll probably grow 
a beard.
8. Is it required?
It helps. And I’ll certainty
need a pair of sandals.
4. What do you expect to earn?
All I ask is the satis­
faction of knowing 
I’m helping to Build 
a Better World.
5. I’ll be doing much the same 
thing. I’ve also lined up 
a job that affects society in 
a positive way. And if I do 
good, I’ll move up, and my 
decisions will be even more 
fcnportant in the scheme of things.
But where’s your beard?
What about sandals?
6. You don’t need them in 
Equitable’s development

an appetite for challenge 
and responsibility, and t 
the desire to do the best 
possible job. The pay is

What’s Doing On Campus?
by Bernard Dobroski
Women Attend 
WAA Conference
Representatives from the Car­
negie Tech Women’s Athletic As­
sociation (WAA) recently attend­
ed the national conference of the 
Athletic and Recreation Federa­
tion of College Women.
'CJean Melaney, junior, art edu­
cation, WAA president, and Nancy 
Mayberry, junior, history, WAA 
vice president, were sent by Car­
negie Tech to the conference at 
the University of Nebraska.
The theme for the conference 
was “Assets for Leadership” with 
emphasis on leadership within the 
WAA.
The opening address was given 
C >by Dean Mary Dolliver, of Ober- 
lin College. She spoke on “In­
gredients for Leadership.”
The closing speaker was Dr. 
Leona Holbrook, chairman, physi­
cal education for women, Brig­
ham Young University. She dis­
cussed the nature of service, 
“What’s In It For Me?”
The convention had two ma­
jor purposes: to recommend sug- 
f gestions for encouraging the 
growth of an effective WAA and 
to clarify the purpose of the 
WAA national organization, 
ARFCW.
Conference participants con­
cluded that the purpose of the 
ARFCW is to “further athletic 
interest and activities for women 
according to the highest and 
soundest standards of sports and 
recreation.” The organization has 
member colleges in 47 states.

Action In Finks-BTP Encounter
over the Organization, 11-5. The 
only other game saw GSIA “B” 
lose by way of errors, 11-10, to 
PKA.
The Grad Eagles seem to have 
things sewn up in the Yanks 
league, but the strong ATO team 
is capable of upsetting them. Last 
week saw SN “A” lose twice, first 
to PKT 34-6, and second to the 
Grad Eagles 27-1. Also, the Finks 
forfeited to the Grad Eagles and
for grabs with no single team 
really showing real potential. BTP 
won its first game by defeating 
TX 35-5, and GSIA ‘F’ pitched 
themselves to a 8-1 victory over 
the Fink “Beauts”. Also TDP beat 
DTD, 11-10, by taking advantage 
of the loser’s errors.
There will not be much activity 
this wTeek due to Spring Carnival, 
but league races should be down 
to wto teams by the end of the 
week.

track team and scored an 82-63 victory last Saturday on W&J’s home field.

The Ideals should easily take 
their game against the ‘‘E.J.'s”. 
However, in what could be a pre­
view of the championship game, 
the Grad Eagles will have to play 
the powerful ATO team.
In the Cards league the Ideals 
are guaranteed a first or second 
with their four straight victories. 
In the past week the Ideals took 
a very close game over SAE, 16-

The Reds league lead is still up
Tech’s chances against W&J 
were hurt early in the meet when 
star broad-jumper Bob Diskin in­
jured his leg competing in the 
jump. Previously undefeated, Dis­
kin’s absence presented a definite 
problem.
Yesterday, the Tartans met 
Grove City and Allegheny in a 
triangular meet at Tech Sta­
dium, the results coming in too 
late to meet the press deadline. 
Tech had a definite chance 
against the Grovers, but a tre­
mendous effort would have been 
necessary to defeat Grove City.

Post Two Wins
by Dale Johnson
The Carnegie Tech golf team 
posted its third and fourth victor­
ies of the season two weeks ago, 
but the Tech duffers also suffered 
their first defeat of the year.
Victory three was an impressive 
6-0 victory over Western Reserve. 
Playing with just a four-man 
lineup, the Tartans swept all four 
individual matches and both best- 
ball matches.
Winning for Tech were Dale 
Johnson, Steve Kessler, John 
Mulholland, and Bob Blazier. The 
bestball teams of Johnson-Kessler 
and Mulholland-Blazier were also 
victorious.
Medalist honors for Tech went 
to Mulholland with 79, followed 
by Blazier with 81, and Johnson 
with 82.
Victory four was a close one 
over Allegheny College by a score 
of 3V2-21/2. Victories were regis­
tered by Johnson, Mulholland, 
and Blazier, while Kessler sal­
vaged a tie.
The other match of the triangu­
lar play turned out to be Tech’s 
first loss of the season. The loss 
was at the hands of the undefeat­
ed Westminster team (6-0).
The final score was 4-2 as 
Tech’s only two victories were by 
Mulholland and Kessler. Medalist 
honors for Tech in the triangular 
play with Allegheny and West­
minster went to Mulholland with 
a fine 76, followed by Johnson 
with 80, and Blazier with 81.
