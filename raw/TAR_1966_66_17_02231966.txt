Watson’s Concert Follows
Ceilidh’s Folk Tradition
by Prof Howard Glasser
The Ceilidh believes it can best serve the communi­
ty by bringing to Pittsburgh the best of traditional 
folk artists or talented unknowns for its annual con­
cert. Last year’s Pete Seeger concert was an excep­
tion to this idea and came to pass because of public 
promoters. The Ceilidh has brought Arthur Argo, 
traditional singer from Aberdean, Scotland, Myra El­
mers from South Carolina, Jerry Rassmussen and 
Luke Faust from New^-York. We also program some 
of the exceptional Ceilidh talent in these concerts.
The Ceilidh which has free open 
gatherings each Friday of the 
school year receives no funds from 
student government or any private 
source. It depends entirely on the 
small margin of income from its 
annual concert.
This year we are very proud 
to present the absolute best in 
traditional performers. No one 
fails to respond to Doc Watson
who combines the finest in in­
strumental and vocal folk art. 
His amazing guitar technique has 
won him a raft of disciples. His 
unaccompanied ballad or sacred 
song is as complete a statement 
as one could hope for. All these 
plus the banjo tunes, harmonica 
soloes, and mandolin breakdowns 
combine with the tales about local 
characters and customs to make 
any encounter with Doc a unique 
and rich experience.
Doc was born in a small com­
munity in the mountains of North 
Carolina where old timey music 
is an everyday thing and the oral 
tradition is still a reality.
«‘Few singers out of the southern 
Appalachians are so able to evoke 
another time, another place, ano­
ther set of esthetic standards.” 
(Robert Sheldon, New York Times).
Doc Watson brings with him Clint 
Howard and Fred Price both of 
whom were born into the American 
music tradition of Tennessee. Fred 
Price adds his fine fiddle to the 
list of instruments.
From present and former 
Ceilidh ranks the concert will dis­
play the sensitive talents of Dwayne 
Thorpe, Fran Vandivier, and Peter 
Hoover. Dwayne Thorpe is a for-
Fraternities Score Well
As Formal Rush Ends
by Rich Steffens
Two-hundred and thirty-two undergraduates pledged the twelve fraternities 
at Carnegie Tech on February 14, culminating one week of concentrated rush 
events.According to rush chairmen, this year’s rush was more successful than those 
of previous years. Significant differences in the rush program included the 
lengthening of dinners and an increase in the number of informal events. Such 
changes were made to increase the amount of contact between individual rush- 
ees and fraternity members.

With Talk On 
Richard III
Carnegie Tech’s English 
department began its 
Eighteenth annual lecture 
series, “In Pursuit of Rea­
son,” yesterday morning 
with a discussion of 
Shakespeare’s “Richard 
III,” by Earle R. Swank, 
dean of men and senior lec­
turer.
The next lecture “Jane Austen,”

earned his bachelor and masters 
degrees from Michigan State Uni­
versity and his doctorate at the 
University of Wisconsin.

degrees from Amherst College, 
Columbia University, and Penn­
sylvania State University.
The lectures will be held in the 
Carnegie Theater, Fine Arts build­

series of programs presented by 
the assembly committee.

ies or individual lectures may be

English, 621-2600, extension 292.
According to Bob Fritz, CFP 
president, this year the Council 
of Fraternity Presidents supplied 
more extensive and superior pub­
licity for the rush events. It ex­
panded the rush book and sent 
schedules of events and blanket 
invitations to the freshmen.
Despite the fact that a larger 
number of houses have adopted 
scholastic minimum requirements 
for pledging a proportionally much 
larger group of students pledged.
Many more are expected to 
pledge after mid-semester grades.
The majority of the fraterni­
ties have scheduled initiations for 
late April or early May.

A High Recommendation
by Howard Lasnik
“Life at the Top*’ is a sequel 
to the very successful Room at the 
Top. Unlike most sequels, how­
ever, this film can stand on its 
own very substantial merit; not 
only is «'Life at the Top” a good 
movie in its own right, it near­
ly surpasses the original.
Ten years after his rapid rise 
to prosperity, Joe Lampton (Lau­
rence Harvey) we discover, is very 
dissatisfied. It will be recalled 
that Lampton had abandoned his 
married mistress, provoking her 
suicide, and married the already 
pregnant daughter of a wealthy 
industrialist. Lampton* s dissatis­
faction with his wife was evident 
even ten years previously in 
“Room at the Top.”
And now he has growing suspi­
cions that his well-paying job is 
little more than a dole. Since 
Lampton is so hard to live with, 
his wife, Susan, turns for com­
fort to the also married Michael 
Craig. Lampton then turns to tele­
vision star, Nora, and eventually 
leaves job and wife to go with her 
to London. When this new rela­
tionship fails, he finally returns 
and is given the apparently pup­
pet job of board of directors chair­
men of his father-in-laws newlj 
merged company of his father - 
in-law.
Admittedly, in straight narration 
this sounds like nothing so much as 
a soap opera plot. But the whole 
film is so tastefully done that the) 
plot doesn’t seem in the least of­
fensive. First, the dialogue is in­
telligent almost throughout. It cov­
ers a wide range, varying from 
light humor to tender love scene 
to restrained viciousness. And all 
are well-executed. One exchange 
between Susan and Sybil, Michael 
Craig’s wife is particularly ef­
fective, even though it uses nothing 
but stock «'cuts”. «,
The acting is of professional 
caliber, with an outstanding per­
formance by Laurence Harvey. 
Jean Simmons, replacing Heather 
Sears as Susan is very good, and 
Honor Blackman (remember Pus­
sy Galore?) is quite competent 
as Nora. The technical aspects of 
the film, photography, composi­
tion, and editing, while never par­
ticularly “inspired,” all demon­
strate a high degree of proficiency.
The only objectionable features 
of the film are incidental plot con­
trivances that didn't quite “come 
off.” Observing his son’s reac­
tion to a newspaper boy, Lamp­
ton realizes that the boy is be­
coming a snob. But his obser­
vation that the boy would have 
snubbed him (Lampton) if they 
would have met when he was young 
is rather superfluous; his son 
snubs him even now. Further, the 
standard technique of having ear­
lier events run through a char­
acter’s mind leads to possible 
confusion. For Lampton recalls 
events that occurred in “Room at 
the Top” as well as those of the 
present film. But these annoyan­
ces are minor. And while I might 
hesitate to support Hollis Alpert's 
Top Ten of 1965 rating, I nonethe­
less recommend “Life at the Top” 
highly.

Editorial
Era Of Communication
President Stever, in his recent address to the stu­
dent body, stated that he has learned “in this first 
year that communication among all of the parties 
interested in Carnegie Tech is a tough thing to handle 
properly.” Nonetheless, during the relatively short 
period of time that he has been here, Dr. Stever 
has made amazing progress in improving communi­
cations on campus.
One of the first undertakings of the president was 
to become acquainted with the student body. He has had 
breakfasts with student leaders, has visited meetings 
of student activities and organizations, has read 
“assiduously” student publications, has discussed 
students and their problems both with faculty and with 
administrative divisions such as Student Affairs.
Thus, Dr. Stever has reopened old lines of commu­
nication from students to administration, and, more 
importantly, he has created many new ones. Further­
more, the president has worked energetically to gain 
a better comprehension of student opinion to aid in 
the formulation of administrative policies and deci­
sions. Dr. Stever receives information from the stu­
dent advisory committee to the Dean of Student Af­
fairs, the student representatives to the Athletic 
Board, and under his administration, student repre­
sentatives have been added to the Academic Affairs 
Committee. With respect to the calendar, moreover, 
the ad hoc committee, at Dr. Stever*s request un­
dertook to poll the dormitory residents and selected 
student leaders to ascertain more completely student 
ideas on the calendar.
The president has realized, however, that commu­
nication from the administration to the students is 
not nearly as good as that in the opposite direction, 
and this has been one of the most pressing problems 
on this campus. The Tartan believes that students 
would have a far lower propensity to complain about 
and criticize destructively the administration’s poli­
cies and practices were they kept more fully informed 
about the reasons behind them. With more complete 
understanding of these reasons students would be in a 
better position to criticize constructively.
It was only until the first meeting of the Athletic 
Board, for example, when a concrete statement of this 
school’s policies regarding varsity athletics was ar­
ticulated and was subsequently published in the Tartan 
for the benefit of the students. It was only with the 
occurrence of the recent incident at Skibo that the ad­
ministration made any attempt to delineate its atti­
tudes regarding the use of Skibo and the role of 
the Security Police on campus. There are many other 
areas which need to be explained and clarified for the 
students by the administration. To cite just one ex­
ample, a statement regarding the purposes - pro­
cedures, and policies associated with the Health 
Service, about which many students on this campus 
regrettably know so little, would certainly be in order.
The president promised in his address that the 
administration “will certainly try to do better”. 
He will even start a column in the Tartan shortly, 
in which either he or some other member of the 
administration will write on topics of current in­
terest. The Tartan will do all it can to aid the 
president in his task of improving communications, 
for the Tartan anticipates that Dr. Stever’s admini­
stration will prove to be a new era of communications.

RFK and the VC
Senator Kennedy of New York 
is an ambitious man and there are 
some who say he would like to be 
President.
In a weekend press conference 
Mr. Kennedy addressed himself to 
the war in Vietnam, declaring that 
we should not only negotiate di­
rectly with the National Libe­
ration Front but that they should 
be admitted to a share in the 
Saigon government.
We have never noticed a po­
litical death-wish in the Sena-, 
tor's make-up, so we must look 
elsewhere for the reason for his 
statement. The press conference 
came hard on the heels of the Sen­
ate Foreign Relations Committee 
hearings, thus far the most publi­
cized questioning of Administra­
tion policy by the Establishment 
itself. Pacifist demonstrations by 
the extreme left have tended to 
drive the voting public into the 
arms of the President, with whom 
they can identify if only because 
he is as clean-shaven as they* 
The revolt of men like Senator 
Fulbright against official policy 
may for the first time create doubt 
in that majority whom Mr. Gal­
lup has found willing to let the 
President make the decisions.
The Senate hearings last week 
treated the American people to a 
short-lived adult comedy series 
everyday (10:30 to 1 p.m. and 2:30 
to 4;30 p.m.) rather than a general 
airing of views and facts. There 
appears to be in the making a tri­
angle of liberal, pacifistic ele­
ments (Senators Morse and Ful­
bright), the establishment forces 
who are presently prosecuting the 
war, and the Republicans who are 
trying to make political hay. One 
of the highlights was watching 
a dead-pan sleazy-eyed Senator 
Albert Gore ask General Taylor 
three separate times how many 
troops the U.S. would need to win 
in Vietnam. And with an equally 
straight-faced General Taylor 
evaded the question and for the 
most part got the performance we 
wanted.. We have grown rather fond 
of adult comedies. One female 
viewer in Skibo was delighted as 
she watched her hero, Senator 
Morse, match Dean Rusk’s bat­
talion of international lawyers with 
ai*. equal number of his own. The 
hearings did clear the air to a cer­
tain extent. They showed that our
administrative and legislative of­
ficials seem to be caught up in 
the same morass of indecision and 
confusion as the American public.
The hearings were both casual 
and symptomatic of a growing 
discontent in a large portion of the 
intellectual community, a discon­
tent which threatens to become a 
national malaise.
We in America would like our 
wars to match the pace of our 
lives, moving quickly and compre­
hensibly toward a logical conclu­
sion. We have been conditioned by 
two decades of maximum retalia­
tion policy preceded by Hiroshi­
ma, the split-second conclusion 
of World War II, to think of war as 
something easily resolved by brute 
powers and comprehensible in its 
progress. Our success or lack of 
it, in prosecuting the war in Korea 
was directly proportional to our 
distance from the 38th parallel.
Now we find ourselves in a war 
where the location of the front is 
no yardstick of success because 
there is no front.
In Ho Chi Minh, we are pitted 
against the man who translated 
Mao's On Protracted Warfare in­
to Vietnamese and who sees nego­
tiations not as a conclusion but as 
the transition.
Senator Kennedy then would in­
troduce this next phase and give 
the Vietcong the toehold from which 
they can launch the final political 
takeover just as they are doing 
in Laos. We believe the New York's 
Senator's ambition is nearly 
boundless, that he would like to 
ride the wave of national weari­
ness and revulsion which he fore­
sees into the White House.
There is a pathetic element in 
the thought that the same flaw in 
the American character (condi­
tioned by the pace of our lives) 
that Mao and Ho are counting on 
to bring them to an easy victory 
by simply outlasting us, is being 
used by an American politician 
to further his own ambitions.

Calendar Inhibits 
Summer Employment
Editor, the Tartan;
The possible calendar for 1966- 
67 mentioned in the February 9 
Tartan, centered around the ob­
jection by the faculties of Engi­
neering and Science and Margaret 
Morrison, is in our opinion highly 
unfeasible and inconsiderate. De­
spite the fact that these faculties 
object to the elimination of a for­
mal examination period we feel that 
an academic calendar beginning on 
August 29 deprives students of the 
work opportunities sought by many 
during the summer months.
The advantage of being releas­
ed from school almost a month ear­
lier will certainly not compensate 
for the necessity of quitting a job 
before labor day. Employers in nu­
merous fields insist upon the em­
ployment of a student up to and af­
ter the labor day week-end.
What apparent good will come 
of registering students on August 
29?
The only obvious aim of this 
suggested calendar revision is 
that of satiating the ever develop­
ed appetites of the faculties of 
Margaret Morrison and Engineer­
ing and Science in their desire to 
torture students with the unnec­
essary strain imposed during exam 
week.
Professors, assistant profes­
sors, associate professors in­
structors and lecturers who insist 
upon giving examinations as a 
means of measuring a student's 
semester accomplishment can 
compensate for the examination 
period by administering hourly 
examinations. Many teachers 
feel that the final constitutes two 
or three hourly examinations. Why 
couldn't they spread these 
throughout the courses rather 
than cramming a semester's work 
into a single examination?
This letter was written after 
discussing the suggested calen­
dar plans with many members of 
the student body. If the Admini­
stration is seeking to attain student 
approval of the suggested calen­
dars and their revisions it should 
go back again to the student body 
for a veto.

Vietnam Situation Demands 
Exploration Of Alternatives
by Paul W. Wortman Graduate, Psychology
The student at Carnegie Tech is now involved in 
the war in Vietnam. The return to the old system 
Of Selective Service classification means that a fixed 
, percentage of each college class is kept available 
for the draft and that graduate school deferments 
are much harder to obtain. While the student may 
consider his military service a patriotic duty, know­
ledge and informed opinion are patriotic necessities. 
This is particularly pertinent to those who believe 
that “in war truth is the first casuality.”
How much do we know about this 
war? Where is it leading us? And 
, are there alternatives? Indeed, 
must we not give thought as well 
as blood to Vietnam? Admittedly, 
there are many facets to the situa­
tion in Viet-Nam and we cannot 
claim expertness on any single 
one; however,-we have taken the 
time to become informed and con­
sider the following issues to be 
of utmost importance.
v Does not the waging of an un­
declared war with its insidious, 
creeping escalation bring us ever 
closer to replacing conventional 
bombs with nuclear weapons? The 
very act of waging war and not 
peace enhances this possibility. 
It is only a short step to em­
ploy B52s to defoliate the bor­
ders of Viet-Nam with atomic 
bombs.
t Or perhaps we shall discover 
another Mac Arthur urging the use 
of these weapons against China — 
after all, isn’t China the real ad­
versary? Why not attack while 
we are stronger? We have said 
there will be no privileged sanc­
tuary.
Does not our preoccupation with 
Viet-Nam both blind and blunt for­
eign policy objectives of much 
\ greater importance? The progress 
in peaceful coexistence and nu­
clear disarmament with the So­
viet Union and the prospect of a 
detente with China are seriously 
jeopardized by the current Viet- 
Nam Imbroglio. How can we hope 
to limit nuclear proliferation and 
achieve any measure of disarm­
ament when all parties are at log­
gerheads because of their com- 
? mitments in Viet-Nam?
Moreover, the war in Southeast 
Asia continues to perpetuate our 
unrealistic one-China policy — a 
policy aimed at keeping Red Chi­
na, an emerging nuclear power, 
excluded and isolated from nuclear 
disarmament and test ban confe­
rences, from world forums such as 
the United Nations, and from 
world trade. This must surely ex- 
\ acerbate Chinese fear of encir­
clement and can only increase 
the probability of a nuclear deba­
cle.
From the strategic point of view 
we hear the time-worn cliches of 
the imperialist. That is, country 
X (read South Vietnam) is very 
rich, innocent, and unduly attack­
ed. We need their resources or 
access to them, and we cannot af- 
* ford to lose them or to allow any 
aggressor to capture them. But 
this view implies that we own Viet­
nam, and we do not. The Geneva 
Accords of 1954, which we claim 
to support, recognize a single, 
united Vietnam. Where is the ag­
gression when one Vietnamese is 
vying with another? Our soldiers 
and a handful of “allies" are the 
only foreign intermediaries to be 
I seen. There is no more aggres­
sion than in our Civil War. This 
view, in short, is totally egocen­
tric and reveals a complete lack 
of concern for the human condition. 
What about the people of Viet-Nam? 
Would we rather see them dead than 
Red? Can we believe that what is 
good for General Motors, Boeing, 
Lockheed, Douglas, United Air­
craft or any other member of the 
P military - industrial complex is 
good for the United States or, 
more specifically, Viet-Nam? Is 
it honorable to die for the pecu­
niary gains of a special interest
group? Is this war really in the 
national interest? And again, what 
about the national interests of the 
Vietnamese?
What is the moral issue anyway ? 
Most would agree that it is to al­
low the Vietnamese people a chance 
to make a choice — a choice of a 
way of life. The choice was in­
dicated by the people in 1945, 
and they chose an independent 
and united Vietnam. That choice 
was denied by subsequent British, 
French, and American interven­
tion and coercion. The result was 
guerilla war and the defeat of 
France at Dien Bien Phu. The 
same promise was provided at 
Geneva in 1954, but American in­
terference undermined this pro­
mise. The people have yet to have 
their say; and it is no wonder 
that they are suspicious of for­
eigners and skeptical of any Am­
erican “peace offers.”
Both sides have stiffened since 
1954, the Accords have been re­
peatedly broken, and many atroci­
ties have been committed by all 
parties. Now we are faced with a 
long war which represents the 
calcification of a bankrupt poli­
cy; a policy that denies those very 
prerogatives that we see as the 
essence of our society — freedom 
of choice.
War allows no choices and en­
sures fewer and fewer alternativ­
es. Even as this is written, the 
activities of our government indi­
cate more escalation in the war 
and increased committment to the 
maintenance of the present Saigon 
regime — a regime that is ap­
parently less representative of the 
people than the one in Hanoi.
If it can be said that Communism 
can tolerate no alternatives, then 
it can also be said that imperial­
ism smothers them.
What do the people of Vietnam 
want ? And who is best able to pro­
vide it? They want peace, a uni­
ted country, food, land for the pea­
sants, lower taxes and lower 
rents (or their abolition), a chance 
to develop their resources, educa­
tion, and an end to foreign inter­
vention and domination.
It may be unfortunate that the 
Communists offer these things, 
but others have refused, putting 
themselves first and the Vietna­
mese people second. If such is the 
choice of the people, and the go­
vernment of Ho Chi Minh can pro­
vide these things where a Diem 
or Marshall Ky cannot, then Ho 
should be the leader of all Viet- 
Nam.
That party which is closest to the 
people shall and must rule, and will 
not perish no matter how many 
bombs are dropped.
Most interested parties agree 
that Vietnamese of all shades seek 
to minimize outside intervention 
and control, especially that of the 
Chinese Communists, and desire 
national unity. But what is our 
current policy doing to further 
those causes?Viet - Nam is not a viable economic 
entity — the North has mineral 
resources while the South has agri­
cultural resources. That a united 
Viet-Nam is necessary was recog­
nized by the Geneva Accords. What 
choice is left to a North Vietna­
mese government that cannot exist 
alone, does not want to become a

Frat Man Questions 
Malakoff’s Facts
Editor, the Tartan;
A frustrated hunter sees a tar­
get in every shadow; unfortunately 
his anxious trigger-finger is as 
likely to bring down a cow or dog 
as a specimen of legal game.
With his article in the February 
16 issue, Mr. Malakoff has seem­
ingly ended the** straight shooting" 
which characterized his reports 
of his summer activities, and has 
begun taking pot shots at quivering 
leaves and shadows behind tree 
trunks. It is sad that his descent 
from inspiring some real soul- 
searching among Tartan readers 
to the status of a weak echo was 
so quick and so complete. He has 
now joined a long list of non- 
Greeks who, throughout the his­
tory of the College Fraternity 
System, have fired a few ill- 
aimed shots at the means by which 
fraternities choose their mem­
bers.
Mr. Malakoff must be given 
credit for one thing — he has used 
“facts". He states without quali­
fication that “men have been re­
fused membership because of their 
color within the last three weeks 
at Carnegie Tech. I wonder where 
he got these “facts"? Did he in­
terview every fraternity man at 
Tech who “Blackballed” some 
rushee?
Since (theoretically) no one 
knows who casts a blackball, this 
must have been quite difficult. 
And having interviewed these men, 
one must suppose that Mr. Mala­
koff was able to establish that in 
at least some specific cases the 
motives for rejection were strict­
ly along color lines? Apparently 
all of the other reasons one man 
might have for feeling he could not 
live for three years in close har­
mony with another man were not 
sufficient to account for the total 
number of rushees who failed to 
receive bids.
Chinese satellite, but finds a South 
Vietnamese government dominated 
by a rigid, imperialist philosphy?
There is no freedom of political 
movement left to the Ho Chi Minh 
regime if this is true. But can 
this not be changed? Are the North 
Vietnamese committed to mili­
tary activity In the South no mat­
ter what? This seems hardly like­
ly ... It Is generally recogniz­
ed by both sides that “change 
takes place more often by accom­
modation than by annihilation," as 
Arthur Schleslnger has put it. 
Negotiations must come sooner 
or later.
How can we make them come 
sooner and still extricate oursel­
ves with honor?
Our recent “peace offensive" 
was both too short and too little. 
We must not only stop the bomb­
ing in the North, but in the South 
as well. Furthermore, we must be 
willing to sit down at the same 
table with the Vletcong or National 
Liberation Front. How can we ne­
gotiate if we refuse to talk with the 
enemy?
We must also be willing to de- 
escalate the war by the withdraw­
al of men and supplies, and agree 
to our eventual total withdrawal 
from Viet-Nam. How can we ex­
pect the North to take our peace 
overtures seriously while we con­
tinue to Increase our forces?
In addition to this, we must 
actively seek a re-opening of the 
Geneva Conference and a return 
to the Accords as a basis for ne­
gotiations. And finally, we must 
avoid such inconsistencies in po­
licy as showing unconditional sup­
port for the Ky regime that refu­
ses to negotiate while stating that 
our goal Is negotiation. Instead 
we should press for a more re­
presentative government in the 
South. These then are some alter­
natives, and we are obligated 
to ourselves and the Vietnamese to 
explore them.
An underlying note in Mr. Ma- 
lakofPs article seems to bring 
forth the image of a young Frosh 
named Malakoff who didn’t re* 
ceive any bids . . . For shame — 
this series of articles was about 
problems of greater import than 
one man’s disappointments in col­
lege.
I would suggest that Mr. Mala­
koff; and any others who feel that 
Tech’s fraternities are hotbeds 
of racial intolerance, observe in 
depth the Greek systems at other 
universities. He would find that 
Carnegie Tech’s fraternities 
have a far better record of racial 
heterogeneity than many, many 
others.

Panepinto Prejudices 
Birch Audience
Editor, the Tartan;
Mr. Panepinto in his search for 
understanding seems to be trying 
to deprive us of ours. Not ques­
tioning for a moment his right of 
expression, I do find it unseemly 
that he, as an organizer of the 
John Birch Society’s program on 
campus, prejudiced the speaker’s 
case beforehand. This could be 
seen in his February 9 column 
and his introduction of the Birch 
speaker.
On February 9 he said, “Any­
one who places more than a su­
perficial value on the meaning of 
the word truth should be present 
to support the real meaning of 
the word." The implications here 
are clear!
The Birch Society prejudices 
their own case well enough with­
out any help from our own Pane­
pinto. I only hope that in the fu­
ture any guest speaker to the cam­
pus regardless of his affiliations 
will be sponsored somewhat more 
objectively.
John Day
Subsenior, Architecture
Fraternities Aren’t 
Business Groups
Editor, the Tartan;
Mr. Malakoff* s column in the 
February 16 Tartan went from 
the controversial to the errone­
ous. His major error is contain­
ed in the last paragraph; “Social 
fraternities exist at colleges to aid 
the colleges to better educate their 
members."
This statement is almost totally 
wrong. They exist primarily be­
cause of the student’s desire to 
belong - to an ingroup, another- 
family, to a group of people who 
care who you are, who demand 
and give loyalty to the group; and 
secondarily, to escape in part 
many of the restrictions and the 
impersonality ot dormitory life. 
The college recognizes and aids 
them mainly to control them; to 
prevent the excesses too often 
associated with the “secret socie­
ty” type of social fraternity, such 
as occurred before the colleges 
legalized their existence.
Thus, irrespective of whether 
the membership criteria are what 
they **should” be, imposition of 
external criteria (or anticriteria) 
would negate the main reason for 
the existence of social fraterni­
ties. The result would be either a 
major desertion of the formal fra­
ternity system by the members, 
with the redevelopment of “se­
cret” fraternities, or (more like­
ly) subdivision of the individual 
** integrated” fraternities intopro- 
and anti-cliques, antagonistic sub­
fraternities sharing only a house 
and financial structure. The asso­
ciated tensions would be at least 
very damaging, and probably would 
destroy the fraternity.
The main point is, antidiscri­
mination forces which can be 
applied to business associations 
cannot be applied to predominant­
ly social associations without de­
stroying them.

SCOPP Molds College
by Sue Lohmeyer
SCOPP, the School-College Orientation Program 
in Pittsburgh, was begun in the spring of 1964 as a 
joint project of Carnegie Tech and the Pittsburgh 
Public Schools. It aims to help undermotivated, 
underachieving high school students improve their 
grades and get into college.
In their sophomore year, stu­
dents from thirteen area high 
schools are recommended for the 
program by their counselors *or 
teachers. They must be of ave­
rage or above - average intelli­
gence, although for one reason or 
another they may be doing poorly 
in school.
About half the number of appli­
cants are accepted and these par­
ticipate in six weeks of summer 
classes and an extra day of 
school each week during the school 
year.
The summer courses start im­
mediately after the close of the 
regular school year. High school 
juniors in the program attend clas­
ses on the Carnegie Tech campus 
from 8:45 a.m. to 4 p.m. each 
weekday. During their fifth week 
the juniors live in the dormitories.
Senior participants live on the 
campus for the entire six week 
period. Enrichment courses in 
English, math, and biology make up 
their basic curriculum.
Last summer the program had 
approximately 45 junior and 37 
senior participants. The juniors 
will continue in SCOPP next sum­
mer.
During the school year, SCOPP 
students attend Saturday morn­
ing classes and special tutoring 
sessions.
Making use of both campus and 
community facilities, the SCOPP 
project sponsors voluntary extra 
curricular activities on Saturday 
afternoons. Students attend cam­
pus and Playhouse drama presen­
tations; play basketball in the gym; 
and take part in tutor-organized 
clubs.
SCOPP is headed by John H.
Morgart, who has had 36 years 
of experience in Hill district 
schools. William Green, vice prin­
cipal of Herron Hill Junior High 
School, is head counselor. Dr.
Theresa Miller is the psycholo­
gist with the program. Each stu­
dent and his family is interview­
ed by Mrs. Ethel Landerman, 
SCOPPs social case worker.
Course teaching is done by both 
Carnegie Tech faculty and teach­
ers from local high schools. In 
some courses, such as biology, 
college students act as assistants, 
although a majority of the stu­
dents are tutors. Barb Blasdel, 
sophomore, business, is in charge 
of the student tutors.
Although SCOPP is now support­
ed by the Economic Opportunity 
Program, its original funds came 
from a Carnegie Corporation 
grant.

Hammers Take 
3-Man Volleyball
by Mike Cooperman
The Civil Hammers won their 
third school championship of the 
year with a victory in the three- 
man volleyball finals over the 
SAE "Lions'*. The Hammers, 
comprised of All-School volleyball 
players John Regan, Clayton Mote, 
and Sam Moise, overcame SAE 15- 
10, 15-8, after losing the first game 
16-14.
In the consolation, ATO took 
third place in the school by defeat­
ing SAE “Gold" 15-7, 15-7.
Bowling Playoffs 
^ The intramural bowling playoffs 
begin this Saturday and will run 
for three consecutive weekends. 
E.J/s “A", the only team to ave­
rage over 800 per series for the 
season, will probably be favored. 
Although they had been relatively 
unimpressive in recent weeks, they 
proceeded to average 852 this past 
week against ATO. Nevertheless, 
ATO, the defending champions, 
and TDP, who took first place in 
their league, should be in the run­
ning, along with BTP and GSIA 
who also had good seasons.
Basketball 
Intramural basketball started 
last week. Since most of the early 
games pit top-seeded teams 
against low-seeded teams, no cru­
cial league games had been played 
as of press time.
Marksmen
Continued from Page 8 
The Tartans, with a 10-3 rec­
ord, travel to Allegheny this week­
end and to Clarion the week af­
ter. Barring any upsets, Carnegie 
should have second place in the 
AIRL pretty well wrapped up, un­
less they have trouble shooting on 
Clarion's tiny range.
Track Practice Starts
Carnegie's track team began 
full-scale practice this week with 
about 30 men on the roster. Over 
half the faces are new to the team, 
and more men are encouraged to 
come out. Practices are from 
4;30 to 5;45 p.m. Monday through 
Thursday.
The first meet is in a little less 
than six weeks. Coach Ed Vamos 
has injury problems already as 
Harvey Gillis, sophomore vaul- 
ter and hurdler, is doubtful due to a 
back injury.
Radiation Processing
Dr. Zalman Shapiro, president 
of Nuclear Equipment and Ma­
terials Corporation, will discuss 
"Radiation Processing, Its Pro­
blems and Promises” on Thurs­
day, March 3, at the University of 
Pittsburgh, Clapp Hall.
This lecture, will be open to 
the public. No admission will be 
charged.
Beginning Guitar
Classes in Beginning Guitar will 
be offered by the YMCA-YWCA 
this semester from February 23 
to March 30, 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
Taught by Dave Shaffer, they 
will cost $2 for members and $4 
for non-members.
Registration deadline is Feb­
ruary 21. Fees may be paid at the

Tartans Topple Bethany, W&J; 
Seek Best Year Since 1936
This year’s Carnegie Tech basketball team enters the final two weeks of the 
season with an excellent chance to become the most successful Tartan floor 
team in 30 years. Last week’s victories over Bethany and Washington & Jeff­
erson raised the Tartans’ season- record to 12 wins and 5 losses with 5 games 
remaining.
Just two wins in these five ga­
mes would give them a higher won- 
lost percentage than the 1959 - 60 
squad which won 15 and lost 9, 
beating Duquesne University twice.
One has to go all the way back 
to the thirties to find a Tech team 
that did better than this: the 1935- 
36 Tartans won 15 and lost 8.
Hard Road AHe_d 
Getting back to the present, Tech 
played at Thiel Monday night and 
faces two rough road games be­
fore returning home to play 
Waynesburg next Wednesday. To­
morrow night the Tartans visit Ge­
neva, newly - crowned champions 
of the West Penn Conference. The 
Covies are led by Joe Worsham, 
a six-foot-seven center who reg­
ularly* racks up 20 points and near­
ly as many rebounds per game. The 
rest of the team lacks height but 
has plenty of hustle — when the 
Tartans beat Geneva 81-71 earlier 
this season, Tech coach MelCrat- 
sley called it “the ‘runningest* 
game of the year.”
After a brief one - day rest,
Tech plays John Carroll in Cleve­
land on Saturday. John Carroll has 
no big man like Worsham but has a 
good team nevertheless. In their 
last few games they beat W. & J.,
Thiel, and Case Tech, and are no­
toriously tough at home.
Ruin Bisons’ StreakThe Tartans broke an 11-game 
Bethany winning streak when they 
beat the Bisons 91-84 at Skibo 
Gym last Monday. Ray Morrison 
put on a tremendous performance, 
hitting 10 of 16 field goal attempts 
and 5 of 6 foul shots for 25 points, 
including 19 points in the second 
half. Mark Lang, starting in place 
of flu-stricken Jeff Kalin, scored 
20 points. The Bisons out-rebound- 
ed Tech 53-33 (their Ed Rollo 
had 26) but the Tartans shot 54 
per cent from the field and play­
ed an alert all-around game. Af­
ter a seesaw first half which ended 
with Tech ahead 42-41, the Tartans 
began to steadily pull away until 
they led 83-70 with five minutes 
to play. Bethany then rattled off 10 
straight points to pull up to 83- 
80, but Lang and Morrison were 
both fouled on fast breaks and 
both sank two foul shots to put the 
game on ice.
In Washington, Pa. last Wed­
nesday Tech spotted W. & J. an ap­
palling 10-0 lead, but crammed 
two big scoring spurts into the last 
few minutes of the first half and 
the first few minutes of the last 
half and won, 65-56. Jeff Kalin 
had 18 points and 19 rebounds, and 
scored several “clutch** baskets.
Each team shot just 35 per cent 
with 19 field goals, but the Tar­
tans converted 27 of 40 free throws 
to 18 of 30 for W. & J.
This victory clinched Tech»s 
first winning season in six years,

and Coach Cratsley discounted 
claims in Pittsburgh papers that 
shoddy play on his team's part 
“soured” the triumph. Said Crat­
sley, “Any win tastes pretty sweet 
to me.*'
Following the W. & J. game the 
Tartans skipped practice on 
Thursday and Saturday to rest up 
for the long week ahead. Cratsley 
thought the rest would be espe­
cially good for Jim Brown, who has 
sore legs. He hopes for Brown to 
contribute “a couple of really good 
games** before the season is over.
Last Home Game 
The game against Waynesburg 
next Wednesday night will be the 
last home contest of the year. The 
season finale is Saturday, March,
5, against Case Tech.

Second in AIRL
by Scott McCormick
Riding a four-match winning streak, the varsity rifle 
team took over second place in the Allegheny In­
ter-collegiate Rifle League last Friday by beating*- 
Clarion 1401 to 1391 at CIT’s (Jenkins) Range. The 
Tartans displayed good depth, with seven shooters 
over the 275 mark.
High man for Carnegie was Scott 
McCormick with a 100-97-87, 284.
Dick Dam berg followed with a 282, 
while Fred Klein, EmoryFroelich, 
and freshman Bruce McKelvey 
rounded out Tech’s scoring with 
279, 278, and 278 respectively.
Kay Dryden, with a 277 for her 
best match of the season, outshot 
nine of ten men from W. & J. who 
came to Tech to fire a match with 
Clarion.
Clarion was not out of the match 
until the last relay when their best 
shooter, Slater, went to the line.
Slater needed to shoot his ave­
rage, a 283, for Clarion to win, 
but under pressure he only fired 
a 272 and Tech won by ten.

Swimmers Split 2; 
Season Nears End
The swimming team split a pair of road meets last1^ 
week to give them a 5 and 6 record going into the fi­
nal regular meet of the season this Friday at 7:30 
p.m. against Western Reserve at the Tech pool.
Last Wednesday a strong Slip­
pery Rock team broke the Tar­
tans* winning streak of three by 
smothering them 76 to 19. Pete 
Hutter won the 50-yard freestyle 
for Tech but the Rockets took first 
in every other event and that just 
about sums up the meet.
2 Records Fall
At Thiel on Saturday, however, 
the Tartan swimmers bounced back 
with a 65 to 30 win and broke two 
school records in the process.In 
the very first event, the 400-yard 
medley relay, the team of Bill 
Cotsworth, Bill Johnson, Frank 
Wyman, and John Perry set a new
Carnegie Tech record by winning 
in 4;19. And Cotsworth, who had 
trouble persuading Coach Claude 
Sofield to let him swim the 200- 
yard backstroke, finished that, 
event in 2;23 to break the old 
school mark by four seconds.
Freshman John O'Brien swam 
in Cotsworth*s usual race, the 500 
freestyle, and won it for Tech. 
Hutter won the 50 - yard free­
style again and the Tech team 
(Hutter, Perry, Yahr, Andrews) 
captured the 400-yard freestyle 
relay, as usual. Thiel took first
