FACULTY TEAM.
It, is being rumored about school 
that, the Faculty are organizing a 
foot-ball team and are (even now) in 
secret practice with thé ultimate idea 
of challenging the ’varsity. Every­
thing is progressing nicely with the 
exception of an occasional disagree­
ment relative to positions, etc. Prof. 
Trinks declares he will not play half­
back unless he can use his slide-rule, 
and Prof. James insists on chemical 
formulae being used.
Prof. Crabtree nearly broke up prac-
A Topic of the Day.
At the present time Pittsburg seems 
to be in the hands of the sand-bag 
man, and its citizens are up in arms, 
clamoring for more protection by put­
ting on an additonal force of two 
hundred policemen. We sincerely 
hope our city fathers will see fit to 
grant this reasonable request, for the 
present limited number of men seem 
to have entirely lost their grasp of 
the situaton. We all know how much 
in fear the underworld is of our brave 
blue-coats, and it s reasonable to pre-

tice last night when he made all wait 
while he figured out the relation of 
the axes of the pig-skin ellipsoid. Mr. 
George makes a fast end, and it is 
thought that Mr. Payne may develop 
into a good man at that position. 
Prof MacLucas is Captain and quarter­
back, and it is claimed by good au­
thorities that he will make the All- 
Neville Street Team without any dif­
ficulty. At center Mr. Thayer is 
without a peer, and Prof. Knox carries 
off the honors at guard. A hot fight 
is promised between Messrs. Low and 
Work for position of water-boy, but 
Mr. C. Parsons has the job of Mascot 
easily landed. The men will go into 
strict training at the Hotel Schenley 
under the eyes of Trainer Hornbostle.

sume that even the mere fact that we 
have a larger force will successfully 
stop any further activity on its part. 
We all know it is to be a fact that the 
man of the mace is always on, deck 
and always gets the right man—-cer­
tainly he does. As an example of his 
ability to always get the worst offend­
er, we refer you to the night after 
the theater party. We all - marveled 
at the exhibition of their Sherlock 
Holmes instinct. But why should we, 
when it is a known fact that keen 
scrutiny and intelligence are among 
the essentials of “The Finest.” The 
only criticism that might be offered 
is that they are sometimes too tender­
hearted, neglecting to use the mace 
even though their own safety be im­
periled. In conclusion, let us say, for 
fear some one may think we are sa- 
tircal, that we are entirely sincere 
in our praise of such as—Fatty the 
Cop.
The Carnegie Tech Foot-ball Team 
met the eleven of the Washington- 
Jefferson College last Saturday and 
played the game of their lives, in 
which every inch of ground was stub­
bornly contested.
The weather for foot-ball could 
scarcely have been better and a fairly 
firm gridiron prevailed. The referee 
selected was John Aiken, of W. & J., 
and the umpire, Dr. A. E. Thompson, 
of U. of P. The time of halves was 
fixed at 25 and 20 minutes.

Some Facts in Regard to Nickel.
By Prof. J. H. James, Head Dept.
Chemistry, Carnegie Tech. School.
Although nickel was discovered as 
long ago as 1751, aside from its appli­
cations in electro-plating, and in the 
manufacture of a few alloys of minor 
importance, it was not until within re­
cent years that its use in the prepara­
tion of nickel steel and ferro-nickel 
has developed, making it to-day one of 
the metals of great importance tech­
nically.
Nickel is a silver white metal, lus­
trous and very tenacious. Air, either 
moist or dry, that does not carry the 
sulphurous fumes common in manu­
facturing centers, will not tarnish 
nickel. It is owing to this fact that 
nickel is used to plate iron or other 
metals. Nickel alloys with most of 
the common metals, increasing their 
hardness, toughness and ductility. A 
few of the minor alloys of nickel are: 
those containing copper, nickel and 
zinc, German silver, packfong, and ar- 
gentan, those containing copper and 
nickel, certain German and United 
States coins (the U. S. five-cent piece 
is 75% copper and 25% nickel), and 
platinoid, a German silver carrying 2% 
tungsten. Platinoid is of interest from 
the fact that its electrical resistance 
changes but slightly with varying 
temperature.
It seems rather queer, considering 
the work that had been done on this 
metal, that its alloys with steel and 
iron did not secure earlier commercial 
recognition. The following story which 
is told on good authority, relates how 
the attention of the English metallur­
gist, Riley, was first drawn to the pos­
sibilities of nickel in this connection: 
An arctic explorer found that the men 
of a certain tribe of Esquimaux were 
using knives and spear heads made of 
some metal wThich had properties su­
perior to the ordinary iron or steel 
purchased of the traders. Inquiry 
disclosed the fact that these imple­
ments were made from a meteorite 
which bad fallen in the locality, and 
that this was worshipped by the na­
tives as something sent by the gods,
since they knew it had fallen from the 
sky. A chemical analysis of one of 
these pieces showed that the material 
used by the natives was an alloy of 
iron and nickel, and it is a well known 
fact that meteoric iron commonly car­
ries nickel. Riley, on hearing this 
story, at once began experiments on 
the manufacture of nickel steel and 
ferro-nickel, that demonstrated the 
commercial value of these products.
A complete discussion of the prop­
erties and uses of nickel steel and 
ferro-nickel is not the purpose of this 
sketch. In brief it may be said that 
nickel has the property of increasing 
the toughness, strength and rigidity 
of steel. It will suffice here merely 
to enumerate some of the present day 
applications of nickel steel: axles of 
railway cars, propeller shafts, certain 
parts of bridge construction, rails on 
curves, armor plate, bicycle tubing 
and boiler tubing.
While nickel occurs in many parts 
of the world in various combinations, 
there are only two great nickel dis­
tricts, and these are widely separated. 
The first of these to be opened up was 
the New Caledonia district, where the 
metal occurs in combination with 
magnesium to form a double silicate. 
This mineral is dark-green to a pale- 
green in color, with a somewhat unctu­
ous feel. Since New Caledonia is a 
dependency of France, the nickel 
mines are worked by French convict 
labor, and the ore shipped to France 
for treatment. The mines are all 
controlled by a French syndicate, Le 
Societe Nickel, and the convict labor 
is let out to this company by the gov­
ernment.
The second deposit of nickel, and 
the one which at the present time is 
yielding more than sixty per cent, of 
the nickel of the world, is in the Sud­
bury district of northern Ontario. 
This deposit occurs in a comparatively 
small area about one hundred and 
twenty-five miles east of the outlet of 
Lake Superior. The nickel here seems 
to be present as a sulphide contained 
in magnetic iron sulphide or pyroho- 
tite. It is a remarkable * fact that 
while pyrohotite is a widely distrib­
uted mineral, the Sudburg deposit is 
the only one that carries nickel. Im­
mense deposits of pyrohotite occur in 
British Columbia, but the most diligent 
search has failed to find a single one 
that carries nickel. However, many 
of the British Columbia pyrohotite de­
posits carry gold and silver in quanti­
ties that make them valuable.
The discovery of the Sudbury nick- 
eliferous pyrohotite was made by the 
engineers who were preparing the 
road-bed for the Canadian Pacific 
railway; at one of the deep cuts in the 
district, a large deposit of this pyroho­
tite was uncovered. The Canadian 
Copper Company soon became the 
largest operator in the district, and 
this concern is now one of the 
branches of the United States Steel 
Corporation. It is said that the Steel 
Corporation also controls the French 
syndicate mentioned above.
Since the Sudbury pyrohotite car­
ries only about 3 2-5% nickel on an 
average, it would be impracticable to 
ship the ore any distance. In this 
part of Canada, fuel in large quantities 
cannot be had, as there is no coal, and 
it is impracticable and too expensive 
to use wood or charcoal in carrying 
out all the metallurgical operations 
incident to the separation of the nick­
el. In addition, labor in Canada is 
more expensive than in the vicinity 
of New York City, so the ore is con­
centrated near the mine by roasting, 
followed by two furnace treatments 
which convert the ore to a high grade 
matte. This ore carries copper in ad­
dition to the nickel, and the matte 
chemically, is a mixture of sub-sul­
phides of nickel, copper and iron, the 
latter being very low. This matte 
analyzes as follows: 40% nickel, 40% 
copper, 39^% sulphur and y2% iron. 
It should be noted here that the pyro­
hotite ore carries a small amount of 
platinum, which as every student of 
metallurgy knows, follows the nickel 
and copper into the matte. This 
high grade matte is shipped to refin­
eries in New Jersey, opposite New 
York City, where it is worked up for 
the valuable metals.
There has been much agitation in 
Canada in regard to the fact that the 
matte is exported duty free. This has 
at different times been taken up by 
one of the political parties. The ar­
gument was, of course, that being a 
Canadian product, all the steps in the 
metallurgy of nickel should be carried 
out in that country, keeping at home 
all the money paid out in the form of 
wages, supplies, etc. However, the 
scarcity of fuel and the high price of 
labor have been obstacles too great to 
be overcome. It is interesting to note 
that the inhabitants of the busy and 
prosperous little mining community of 
Sudbury have been opposed to the 
idea of an export duty, preferring to 
let well enough alone rather than run 
the risk of having the industry de­
moralized by the changed conditions 
that would result from levying an ex­
port duty.

A Chance for School Spirit.
The authorities of the school have 
decided that we cannot have an ice 
surface on the large tennis course this 
winter. Howrever, Mr. Hamerschlag 
has suggested that we use the old 
dam at the end of the ravine running 
parallel to Woodlawn avenue and back 
of the school to make a pond. Such 
a pond would be at least a hundred 
feet wide at the most narrow point 
and about three hundred feet long. 
The dam can be repaired by a few 
fellows who are not afraid to put on 
their old clothes and handle a pick or 
a shovel for a few hours. There are 
several small springs on the hillside 
which would fill up the pond in a few 
days. As cold weather is very close 
at hand, it is necessary that we get to 
work and repair the dam as soon as 
possible.

The meeting of the American Foun- 
drymen’s Association held at the 
Hotel Astor, New York, was a nota­
ble gathering of two hundred and 
fifty men vitally interested in manu­
facturing problems.
A very able address was delivered 
by Congressman Littlefield of Maine, 
and to President Briggs was presented 
a gold watch and other tokens of the 
appreciation of the Foundrymen’s As­
sociation for his work during the 
year.
After the presentation, Director Ar­
thur A. Hamehschlag of the Carnegie 
Technical Schools delivered an ad­
dress on the “Influence of Trade and 
Technical Eduction on Industrial Su­
premacy.” After comment on the 
spirt of brotherhood and friendship 
wrhch seemed to exist at this meeting 
on the part of the competitors in 
business, he called attention to the 
favorable effects of such contact, 
tracing the growth of education from 
the unskilled labor to the semi-skilled; 
to the manual dexterity; to the utili­
zation of the brain to direct and guide 
the hand; pointing out the significant 
need which the new era of industry 
demanded in the way of brain cultva- 
tion, so that man might be ruler of 
nature’s forces, and aided by the 
mechanism which he created and de­
vised, could lighten the load placed in 
past centuries on the physical frame 
and muscular power of the individual.
He drew attention to the necessity 
of individual instruction, since boys, 
like men, had characteristics whch 
made it impossible to deal with them 
as prototypes of each other. He 
dwelt on the intense brain cultiva­
tion necessary to lift a man from the 
sphere of the semi-skilled and skilled 
class, into the engineering and scien­
tific class. He spoke of the need of 
economic education to develop the 
business instinct and the sense of
values. And he then impressed upon 
the Association the fallacy of ex­
pecting partally trained and semi­
skilled mechanics to do the work of 
the man who had been tried by the 
fire - of experience and who had re­
ceived a sound trade preparation.
His remarks concluded with the ef­
fects of the growth of this intellectual 
power, which controlled the muscular 
to enhance the value of materials and 
to make the product marketable; final­
ly describing in detail some of the

We are the M
1911.
At a meeting of thé Social Commit­
tee of 1911, it was decided that the old 
saying, “All work and no play makes 
Jack a dull boy,’ ’is true.
In order, therefore, to introduce the 
necessary “play” into the course, a 
smoker was decided upon. It is to 
take place on the evening of Monday, 
Dec. 3, at the school building, and 
wilt- no doubt establish a precedent in 
that particular kind of function.
A diversified form of entertainment 
will be provided and refreshment of a 
liquid nature will be served. The 
main part of the program will be held 
over until about 10:30, in order that 
the second year men will have time to 
come in, and not miss a great deal of 
the really excellent entertainment. As 
the smoker is not to be strictly a class 
affair the members of the class of
1910 are requested to attend to make 
it more of a school function.
Those having the affair in charge 
define their purpose in a statement is­
sued by Chairman Hess, which reads 
as follows:
“Since the object of the class of
1911 is to promote sociability among 
its members and also since we seldom 
meet as a body, we decided that we 
could best get acquainted with our 
classmates under the balmy clouds of 
the seductive weed. This is intended 
to be an informal social affair and any 
one attending is requested to leave 
formality outside.
This is not a financial venture, and 
every one who attends is guaranteed 
his money’s worth.
The fee of 25c is solely for the pur­
pose of defraying the unusually heavy 
expense Connected with this particular 
smoker. Outside talent has been 
secured to entertain and will be augu- 
mented somewhat by local student 
entertainers.
In inviting the class of 1910 our ob­
ject is to get acquainted with them as 
well as with our our men.
-----------o-----------
THAT GAME.
The class of 1910 has decided that a 
football game without any preparation, 
and especially with the doughty war­
riors of 1911 is too much of an under­
taking. The team representing 1911 
appreciates the compliment but are 
sorry that 1910 is unable to meet them. 
However, every one is aware of the 
fact that it would be foolish in the 
extreme to get out at football prac­
tice after 10:30 p. m.j
The disappointment at the failure 
of 1910 to accept the “defi” has .been 
partially removed by the booking of 
the Day School Plebes, as the attrac­
tion for Thanksgiving afternoon.
akers of the Carnegie
The night men have been practicing 
and will continue to do so until the 
moment before the kick-off.
-----------o-----------
The students of the Margaret Mor­
rison School are invited to witness this 
game and not for their favorite team. 
It will be a good opportunity for the 
girls of the day school to see what the 
night school can show in the way of 
football players and rooters. The 
night boys are going to turn out en 
masse to root for their team, and if 
the night girls accept the cordial in­
vitation extended them they will do 
likewise.
An effort on the part of the class 
of 1911 is going to be made to hold a 
dance in the near future.
A committee wraited upon Miss 
Smith of the Margaret Morrison 
School last Friday night in order to 
get her permission and assistance in 
making arrangements for a little in­
formal affair between the class officers 
and members of committees of the, re­
spective schools as the sole partici­
pants.
That such a thing would be mutually 
beneficial is quite evident. It would 
be of value to the boys, in that it 
would give them a good opportunity to 
prove to their esteemed “co-eds” that
1911 is composed entirely of gentle­
men.
-----------o—-------
C 1 has a lad who does not know 
what what equals. He said that that 
meant nothing. He was told that if 
he had had it in algerbra it would be 
the same.
At a certain committee meeting one 
of the committeemen reported the do­
ings in the following well-chosen 
words: “We were lost in a multiplicity 
of complications, from which the in­
genuity of the chairman, not the poly- 
syllatic volubility of the secretary 
could extricate us.”
Pupil of G-l—Doctor, you have spell­
ed a word wrong.
Dr. Plolbroke (nonchalantly)—Mere­
ly an eccentricity of genius.
What are some of the products of 
iron?
Bright boy in A-l—Structural ma­
terial, rails, nails, machines, tools and 
tin cups.
The girls are able to paint a stone 
to look so much like a cork that it 
will iloat if put in water.
There is surely a great amount of 
credit due our football team for the 
splendid victory at Meadville. “1911” 
congratulates you heartily.

FOOTBALL.
Mechanicals vs. Electricals.
Yesterday afternoon the Mechan­
icals defeated the Electricals in a 
hotly contested game by a score of 
5—0. Martin was easily the star, but 
Neudorfer, Hatch and Ramp played 
a good game.
-----------o-----------
TECH DOMITORY.
It was decided at an informal meet­
ing of the men living at the new 
dormitory to call the house; Wood- 
lawn Cottage, subject to change by the 
Director. Study hours were decided 
upon and the study period is to extend 
from 7:30 to 10:30 p. m., between 
which hours no visiting between 
rooms will be permitted. Those now 
occupying rooms at the Cottage are: 
Potts, Smith, Rosenfeld, Barnes, 
Turner, Wallace, Decker, Beeken, 
Knight, Foster, Best, Huntley, Bates, 
Todd, Brobst and Sprengle.
-----------o-----------
SKATING.
With the coming of winter, also 
comes the thought of skating. Of 
course the fellows at Tech like to 
skate, but where? It was proposed at 
first that we flood the tennis courts, 
this we intended to do, but the faculty 
ruled that we would spoil the courts 
if we did. Mr. Merrill, who is trying 
to make this a go, then proposed that 
we fix the dam in the hollow were 
there was once a lake. This would be 
an ideal place for a lake, as it is sev­
eral hundred feet wide and we could 
make it almost any length. Another 
advantage is that the dam is already 
there, so that all we have to do is to 
fill a gap in it; this we could easily do 
with the old material from the school, 
and Mr. Fields says that we can use 
the bricks, and stones from the old 
house on the hill. There is a spring 
to fill it up and if this would not be 
sufficient we could turn the water 
plugs on and in this way fill it up.
About all that we need is the as­
sistance of the fellows. So come on 
fellows join us, and reap the benefits.

1910.
At a meeting of Class 1910 held 
Nov. 21, Mr. O. L. Bear was unanimi- 
ously elected as faculty advisor of the 
Class. Last year Mr. Bear was chosen 
to the same office, by the class, and 
his services and efforts towards pro­
moting class spirits were so success­
ful, that he has been asked to continue 
the same this year.
Mr. H. L. Grate of section 2-A was 
elected, by acclamation, as repre­
sentative of Class 10 on the “Thistle” 
Board.
Now that the sections have been re­
arranged, and the boys have become 
settled, w'ork is progressing smoothly 
in all the classes. Considering the 
large number of students in Class 1910, 
it is surprising that the right combina­
tions were so quickly formed. Last 
year quite some time was lost in get­
ting the boys lined up; but from all 
indications, this time will be made up, 
and lots more gained before the first 
term is over.
Remarks are already heard favora­
bly expressing the progress made so 
far, and it is safe to predict that be­
fore the year is over everyone will 
have reached the mark expected for 
the first tw'o years’ work.
The new men having charge of sell­
ing membership tickets of the Athletic 
Association report poor success in 
disposing of them, and have asked for 
some suggestions that will facilitate 
their efforts.
The Athletic Association at the 
present time has no means of sup­
port outside of the funds acquired 
from the sale of these tickets. Funds 
are requisite in every undertaking 
and especially so in athletics, and until 
we have grounds for holding athletic 
events to which an admission can be 
charged, we should, each of us, join 
in and provide the association with the 
necessary financial backing, which 
will enable it to bring athletics of our 
school to a high state of development. 
Through the good work of the Hockey 
Team of last year, and the Foot-ball 
Team of this year, Carnegie Tech has 
laid a foundation for a good reputa­
tion in sports among the larger schools 
in this section of the country that 
should make all students proud.
Don’t let the foundation so well be­
gun stand alone for the want of suffi­
cient funds to continue the good work, 
but make it possible to keep on build­
ing up until such a reputation has 
been acquired that shall be second to 
none. The only way to attain this 
position is to have the support of the 
entire student body.
The privileges of a membership in 
the Athletic Association, at the pres­
ent time, are very few, but with the 
support of every one, and a little time, 
these privileges shall be manifold and 
we then can better appreciate them, 
through the fact of helping when help 
was needed.
Dibble, of 2-C, surprised Prof. Mc- 
Lucas when he read his essay in class 
last Wednesday by the easy manner 
in which he handled the English lan­
guage, and as one of the boys re­
marked in his criticism of Dibble’s 
paper, ‘ There were too many words 
in it of which he did know the mean­
ing.”
Peters, of 2-D, went to sleep in 
mathematics the other night, and the 
boys are going to buy him an alarm 
clock. Stay awake, old man!
Considine, 2-D, made quite a hit in 
his capacity of a “newsy.” He sold all 
his copies of the Tartan.
From the way 2-C has taken hold 
of the subject of Graphs (“grafts”), 
one might suppose they took a course 
in Harrisburg recently.
Taylor tried to elucidate to Prof. 
I-Iokansen how to find the center of 
gravity of a trapezoid, but Prof. H. 
showed him how “he got in wrong.”
Has anyone tried to break a tooth­
pick under a hankerchief for 
Schwartz? Don’t bet too much you 
can do it, or Schwartz will fool you.
President Sheehan is showing his 
ability in handling the meetings of 
Class 1910 and bids fair to succeed 
himself next year. He was elected by 
the “Grand Old Crowd” and illus­
trates how much a good man, in the 
right place can accomplish.

Education.
NEWS ITEMS.
Last. Saturday evening Mr. Frederic 
Allen Whiting, of Boston, gave a very 
interesting lecture in Assembly Hall 
on the “Meaning of the Arts and 
Crafts,” under the auspices of the 
Allegheny County Manual Arts Asso­
ciation.
About fifteen of the day school men 
have secured positions after school 
hours with the Pittsburg Railways 
Co. The editors wish to say that 
their is no reason for any man to quit 
school for lack of funds, providng, of 
course, he is willing to work, for it is 
understood that there is always more 
positions than men at our “impromptu” 
Employment Office.
Olof Reutersward, Chief Engineer of 
the Gellirare Mines, Mahnberget, Swe­
den, visited the school on Friday and 
was very much interested in the work
being done. ---------------
In the November “Industry” ap­
pears a very cleverly written and il­
lustrated article on “The Upbuilding 
of a Great Industrial University.” The 
description outlines the work contem­
plated as well as that already done 
at our schools. The CUT of the com­
pleted schools is very interesting and 
most of us do not realize their ex­
tent. It is worth every one’s while to 
read this article.

During this week the various Plebe

as to whether constructive English or 
English literature is the best means 
of instruction in this course. We hope 
they can solve the problem in a satis­
factory way.
The Plebe class held a meeting on 
Friday, Nov. 23, and elected Exline of

AN INSTRUCTIVE GIFT.
The mechanical laboratory has re­
ceived a number of parts of the Curtis 
steam trubine, manufactured by the 
General Electric Co. They are: One 
intermediate segment which is the 
stationary part between the rotating
bladed member, one part of the afore­
said wTheel with two-blade rows, and 
a section of extruded metal. This last 
is of a special composition which has 
been found to give best results when 
used for turbine blades. A carbon 
packing is also included. A nozzle 
segment has been presented to the 
school, but it has not yet arrived.
A general sectional drawing through 
the turbine and generator, which has 
been framed and hung on the south 
wall, is sufficiently large to show the 
arrangement of parts and steam pas­
sages. She gift also includes some de­
tail drawings of parts, as well as some 
drawings of parts, as well as some 
diagrams for calculating the parts of 
steam turbines.
This gift is in accordance with the 
liberal policy of the General Electric 
Co., and is sincerely appreciated by 
the schools.

THE ARCHITECTS.
Watch the Tech Architectural Club 
for surprises in the Basket-ball line. 
A committee has been appointed to

with R. Chester, chairman; L. Decker, 
Lyman, Lamont.
A very pleasant meeting was held 
of the T. A. C. at A. G. Lamont’s house 
on Monday evening, and the boys 
practiced some pieces for a double 
quatrette. Good music should make 
the clubs smokers a very plaesant 
event.
Some one started a rumor that A. 
Z. Harrison, the T. A. C. treasurer, had 
been held up and robbed of several 
hundred dollars of the club’s money, 
but it is a mistake.
Prof. Hornbostel is quoted as saying 
that if the windows along the archi­
tects’ room was painted black, there 
would be more work done toward 3 
o’clock in the afternoon.
Last Friday the T. A. C. held their 
second meeting and elected A. G. La­
mont of the Plebes, to the Historian’s 
chair.
