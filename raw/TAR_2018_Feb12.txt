CMU Professor Mark Kamlet on automation’s future impact
EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
With the advent of self-
driving cars and many 
other kinds of arti?cial 
intelligence technology 
making their way into 
every professional ?eld, 
many researchers and the 
public wonder about the 
impact these technological 
advancements will have 
on human jobs if machines 
can — or potentially could 
perform — so many of 
the skilled tasks that hu-
mans currently perform. 
Mark Kamlet, a Provost 
Emeritus and University 
Professor of Economics and 
Public Policy at Carnegie 
Mellon, is currently pursu-
ing research on the future 
of automation and its im-
pact on the economy and 
people’s lives, along with 
Seth Goldstein, an Associ-
ate Professor of Computer 
Science at the university. In 
an interview with The Tar-
tan, Kamlet discusses high-
lights of his research, its 
implications, his personal 
reasons for being involved, 
and what he wants to of-
fer students in his seminar 
class this semester.
Though he has a doctor-
ate in economics, Kamlet 
chooses to study automa-
tion in part because while 
economics can adequately 
explain many phenomena, 
“economics has never been 
very good in explaining 
technological change.” He 
saw a hole in the ?eld of 
economics when it came to 
assessing and explaining 
the impact of technology 
on society. Seeing the tech-
nological focus of Carnegie 
Mellon, he saw the inter-
section of economics and 
technology as an area of 
research that suited his 
interests and those of the 
university.
Being a researcher on 
automation and its social 
impacts, Kamlet believes 
that much of the public dis-
course about the future of 
technology and what that 
would mean for jobs is too 
black-and-white. The pub-
lic tends to talk about the 
percentage of jobs that will 
be replaced by technology, 
but he has a more nuanced 
view: just because a job 
isn’t replaced by technol-
ogy doesn’t mean that it 
won’t be impacted, either 
for better or for worse.
“Technological change, 
going way back, has 
always been disruptive,” 
Kamlet asserts. He cites the 
industrial revolution, when 
steam engines appeared 
and took away certain jobs 
while creating new, dif-
ferent ones. He acknowl-
edges that some people are 
affected more than others, 
and that the unemployed 
cannot always be retrained 
for the new jobs that paid 
similarly to their old jobs. 
But eventually, after some 
years, society reaches a 
balance with the presence 
of the new technology, in-
cluding by creating jobs in categories 
no one speculating 
before the changes 
happened would 
have thought of.
“Twenty years 
ago, search en-
gine optimization 
experts wasn’t a job 
category; now it is,” 
Kamlet states, as 
just one example of 
a recently emerged 
job category.
Kamlet empha-
sizes that the im-
pact of technology is not 
clear cut: it is not either 
lose the job or keep the 
job. Rather, most jobs will 
be impacted because the 
circumstances on the job 
change. He gave the exam-
ple of cashiers. In the years 
before computers, 
cashiers had to 
memorize all the 
prices of the items 
and be skilled at 
mental arithmetic 
— a far cry from 
the lower-skilled 
cashier jobs we 
see today. Because 
of the reduction 
in skill involved, 
the salaries of ca-
shiers went down 
— the jobs still 
exist, but were sig-
ni?cantly affected 
by the advancement of 
technology.
To those worried about 
the possible technologi-
cal takeover of their pay-
checks, Kamlet says that 
there should be nothing 
to worry about if they are 
able to acquire new skills 
needed later. He does ac-
knowledge, however, that 
retraining cannot help 
everyone displaced get 
a new job and that not 
everyone is able to acquire 
Case Challenge deals with CMU CoinAB brings Neistat in for Geek Week
ADAM TUNNARD
Staffwriter
This past Friday saw 
the conclusion of “Geek 
Week,” an Activities Board-
organized celebration of 
geek culture meant to “let 
your inner-nerd shine.” 
Kicking off the week of 
events was a Monday lec-
ture in the Cohon Center by 
renowned YouTube creator 
Casey Neistat.
Casey Neistat is a ?gure 
who has seen massive suc-
cess in a few spheres: as 
a ?lmmaker, commercial 
advertiser, technology 
start-up entrepreneur, and 
YouTube vlog mogul — the 
latter being the ?eld where 
he has gained the most 
recognition. 
His career has taken a 
series of fascinating turns, 
which has led to a unique 
life story that many have 
found inspiring. He trav-
eled from his home of 
New York City to talk at 
Carnegie Mellon about this 
uncommon lifestyle and 
the tumultuous path he 
took to get to where he is 
today.
Neistat showed up a few 
minutes late to a crowded 
McConomy Auditorium 
due to two plane cancella-
tions, but wasted no time 
getting into some dense 
life lessons. The goal of his 
lectures, he said, is to “walk 
you through my life in a 
way that doesn’t work with 
videos.” Though his videos 
offer interesting perspec-
tives on his life, his lecture 
was a more all-encompass-
ing and re?ective look at 
his experiences.
He started from the 
very beginning, saying, 
“My whole childhood was 
about ?ghting to be heard.” 
He explained that after 
getting his high school 
girlfriend pregnant and 
living in a trailer home, he 
was desperate to get people 
to hear his “loser” perspec-
tive. While working for 
minuscule wages as a dish-
washer, he discovered that 
?lmmaking was the perfect 
means to do so.
After being dumped by 
his girlfriend, he, as a single 
father, maxed out his credit 
card to buy a Macbook to 
make videos, and moved to 
New York City. He worked 
odd jobs and made videos 
for art collectors, success-
fully gaining enough cred-
ibility to earn a decent liv-
ing. This credibility led to 
him making a video about 
New York’s over-ticketing 
of bicyclists titled “Bike 
Lanes.” Posted on what at 
the time was a relatively 
new format, YouTube, 
Neistat’s channel exploded.
The success of “Bike 
Lanes” led to an HBO show 
with his brother titled The 
Neistat Brothers. He is most 
notable for his daily vlog, 
which was a challenge to 
himself to “make a movie 
every day.” His vlog sky-
rocketed his popularity 
and gave him a steady fan 
base. Meanwhile, he start-
ed a technology company 
Beme, which sold to CNN 
for $25 million in 2016.
The lecture covered 
this miraculous path to 
success, but was also rich 
with advice to the mostly-
student audience. One of 
the biggest things Neistat 
wanted to stress was the 
notion that “no one knows 
anything,” that the tempes-
tuousness of life could not 
be predicted by anything or 
anyone. 
His talk focused mostly 
on telling his life story as a 
means of inspiring others 
to realize their dreams, and 
to ?gure out what those 
may be, though he himself 
conceded to sounding a 
little cliche.

For the past few months, 
all eyes have been on cryp-
tocurrency prices as cryp-
tocurrency speculation 
has entered into the main-
stream. This past Saturday 
at the Simon Auditorium in 
Posner Hall, however, un-
dergraduate students from 
every college at Carnegie 
Mellon University gath-
ered for Undergraduate 
Business Case Challenge 
to figure out how a “CMU 
Coin” could change life on 
campus.
Colleges have been 
quick to attempt to 
funnel student interest 
into expanded academic 
exploration of this topic, 
with a New York Times ar-
ticle this past week cover-
ing mostly graduate-level 
classes cropping up at 
Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, 
Duke, Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology, and 
the University of Maryland 
that have focused on cryp-
tocurrency, Bitcoin, and 
blockchain technology.
The winning team, Team 
Kappa, want to use CMU 
Coin to more efficiently al-
locate resources on campus 
through a bidding system. 
They planned on using 
CMU Coin as an incentive 
to keep students active 
on campus, and using the 
blockchain technology as-
sociated with CMU Coin 
to create an “immutable, 
transferable, and perma-
nent storage” of student 
ledgers. 
The second place team, 
Team Alpha, focused more 
on the potential of CMU 
Coin as a currency. They 
claimed that it would 
speed up the verification 
process that Student Lead-
ership, Involvement, and 
Civic Engagement (SLICE) 
does for purchases made 
by student organizations, 
changing what is currently 
a wait time of around a 
month to a mere eight min-
utes. This, they asserted, 
would lead to a more vi-
brant campus life, as orga-
nizations would plan more 
events and be more open to 
collaboration.
Both teams skewed 
traditional conversations 
about cryptocurrencies 
by looking for ways that a 
CMU Coin could be better 
for the environment, sug-
gesting that mining could 
be more efficient and 
powered by sustainable 
resources.
This week’s challenge 
was a large departure from 
past case challenges in 
terms of subject. 
Elaine Kim, a business 
major on the Kappa team, 
said that “other [chal-
lenges] have been about 
specific companies,” but 
she had been drawn to this 
one because it afforded an 
opportunity to “learn more 
about cryptocurrency.” 
Yiyi Zan, a senior on the Al-
pha team majoring in Busi-
ness and Statistics agreed, 
stating “that this was the 
most interesting case [she] 
had ever been a part of.” 
She found that while “oth-
er cases revolved around a 
problem,” looking for uses 
for a cryptocurrency on 
campus let her think about 
“solutions we can imple-
ment with this technol-
ogy.”
Professor Param Singh, 
Carnegie Bosch Chair and 
Associate Professor of 
Business Technologies at 
the Tepper School of Busi-
ness, co-authored the case 
and is working on the de-
velopment of CMU Coin. 
He is careful to highlight 
that the purpose of CMU 
Coin is not to create a 
cryptocurrency for the uni-
versity, but rather to ex-
periment with the mecha-
nisms and functionalities 
of cryptocurrency. Singh 
stated, “the whole idea is 
not for cryptocurrency,” 
but to work with the com-
puter scientists and econo-
mists at Carnegie Mellon to 
understand cryptocurren-
cies. “With all these cryp-
tocurrencies out there, we 
realized we don’t know a 
lot about cryptocurrency,” 
he said.
This case was meant 
to collect student ideas 
about the potential for 
this currency. Singh states 
that CMU Coin will be a 
“student driven project” 
and that students will be 
able to “build their own 
changes.” He hopes that 
CMU Coin will “demystify 
[cryptocurrency] for 
students.”
Singh finds that all 
cryptocurrencies have cer-
tain characteristics in com-
mon: ‘proof of work,’ the 
method where participants 
solve problems to ‘mine’ 
coins, anonymity, and 
decentralization. Singh 
hopes that CMU Coin will 
shift these expectations 
by being more centralized 
and easy to regulate, in ad-
dition to being greener. 
This anonymity and 
lack of regulation and cen-
tralization is what many 
have lauded about current 
cryptocurries but these 
changes to the typical type 
of cryptocurrency, CMU 
Coin developers hope, 
will allow them to combat 
speculation and stabilize 
prices, as well as model a 
future where cryptocur-
rencies may be regulated. 
When asked how the re-
cent hype surrounding the 
price of cryptocurrencies 
has effected this project, 
Singh replied that the CMU 
Coin project is not based 
upon the hysteria sur-
rounding cryptocurrencies 
but rather the potential of 
the technology.
“Cryptocurrency is 
going to be the future,” 
Singh stated before going 
on to detail how various 
economies are looking to 
integrate cryptocurrencies. 
“A pound might be a cryp-
topound, a dollar might 
be a cryptodollar.” He has 
found that the recent fo-
cus on cryptocurrencies 
“has raised interest, and 
we need to understand it 
more.”
This Undergraduate 
Business Case Challenge, 
sponsered by the PNC 
Center for Financial 
Services Innovation, gave 
students a chance to think 
about how this attempt to 
understand cryptocurren-
cy might be able to effect 
the lives of all students.

Measles case is no cause for alarm if properly vaccinated
ADAM TUNNARD
Staffwriter
Feb. 9 marked a very 
surprising day for many 
Carnegie Mellon students 
and faculty, as an email was 
sent by University Health Ser-
vices con?rming that a gradu-
ate student was found to have 
measles, a highly contagious 
viral infection that is usually 
preventable by vaccination.
That being said, the 
student was fully vaccinated, 
in accordance with Carn-
egie Mellon University’s vac-
cination policy. This is an 
extraordinarily rare thing, 
as “two doses of [Measles, 
Mumps,and Rubella] vaccine 
are about 97 percent effec-
tive at preventing measles; 
one dose is about 93 percent 
effective,” according to the 
Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention.
The student was active 
at the “Carnegie Mellon 
University campus between 
Wednesday, Jan. 17 and 
Thursday, Jan. 25” and on 
“Port Authority buses 61A, 
61B, 61C or 61D several times 
during that period, but pre-
cisely which bus route or 
time of day is not known,” 
according to an email sent 
out to students by Executive 
Director of University Health 
Services Beth Kotarski. If you 
were in these places, as many 
students were, you might not 
need to be as fearful as you 
might think.
Measles is a highly con-
tagious infection, but with 
proper vaccinations, it is 
extremely unlikely to con-
tract the virus. Symptoms 
include a high fever followed 
by a runny nose, cough, and 
red eyes, usually in addition 
to a raised, red rash. Unfor-
tunately for our anonymous 
Carnegie Mellon graduate 
student, they were part of the 
small percent of vaccinated 
individuals who still risk be-
ing susceptible to the virus.
Most cases and out-
breaks of measles take place 
in areas where vaccination 
is uncommon. In 2014, a 
largely unvaccinated Amish 
community was shook with 
383 cases, one of the larg-
est outbreaks in the United 
States since vaccination was 
introduced. Another notable 
case was in 2015, when Cali-
fornia, a hotspot of the anti-
vaccination campaign, and 
its surrounding states saw an 
outbreak that began with a 
traveler from abroad visiting 
a popular amusement park.
Though most serious out-
breaks affect unvaccinated 
groups, it is not unprec-
edented to see vaccinated 
people contract the virus. 
In 2014, an article in Science 
Magazine made headlines 
as it con?rmed the ?rst time 
a vaccinated individual had 
contracted measles. The ar-
ticle also discussed the poten-
tial of the disease not having 
the longevity scientists once 
expected.
Here at Carnegie Mellon 
University, we are certainly 
seeing something rare, but 
not something to fear or 
something unprecedented. 
Most cases come from out 
of the country and spread 
among unvaccinated people. 
The likelihood of the gradu-
ate student case here on 
campus was around three 
percent if they were properly 
vaccinated. The likelihood of 
someone else, properly vac-
cinated, of contracting it from 
them is far smaller.
The email concluded that 
they were writing to us “out 
of an abundance of caution,” 
and that those who actually 
are at risk are “Anyone born 
since 1957 who has not re-
ceived two doses of effective 
measles vaccine known as 
MMR, which would include 
infants too young to have 
been immunized” and “per-
sons who were vaccinated 
with an inactivated vaccine, 
which was used from 1963 
through 1967, and have not 
been re-vaccinated; and 
those who refused vaccina-
tion.” This is, of course, a 
likely very small percentage 
of campus.
Despite the statistical un-
likelihood of any other cases 
affecting the Carnegie Mel-
lon campus and community, 
if you develop any of the 
aforementioned symptoms, 
call 412-268-2157 during 
the day or 1-844-881-7176 
after hours, before visiting 
University Health Services. 
Students are in good hands as 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
in conjunction with the Al-
legheny County Health 
Department, make it clear 
that they are taking the 
matter very seriously.
STUDENT GOVERNMENT COLUMN
PRATHAM GUPTA
Special to The Tartan
The Carnegie Mellon 
Undergraduate Student 
Senate is hosting Spring 
2018’s Senate Week 
from Feb. 12 to Feb. 
16. This semester, the 
theme for Senate Week 
is “Reflections,” one that 
we believe will augment 
student life, culture, and 
growth here at Carnegie 
Mellon. This is a week not 
only to reflect upon our 
experiences as students 
from a plethora of socio-
economic backgrounds, 
but also to self-examine 
the entire student experi-
ence at Carnegie Mellon, 
from housing to dining to 
extracurriculars to differ-
ent organizations — each 
and every single student 
can make a difference if 
they choose to do so.
Every single day of 
Senate Week has a differ-
ent focus — on Monday, 
students can chat with 
Senators about current 
undergoing initiatives 
and can give feedback 
regarding the aforemen-
tioned. On Tuesday, feel 
free to visit the Center for 
Diversity and Inclusion to 
participate in panels and 
discussion with Advocacy 
about how we can start 
making an impact on stu-
dent lives concerning so-
cial issues. On Wednes-
day, the Campus Life and 
Finance committees are 
spearheading an organiza-
tion spotlight to allow stu-
dents to explore the vari-
ous aspects of student life 
on campus. Or just come 
visit the Senate Table for 
the food!
The Business Affairs 
Committee is hosting an 
open forum this Thursday 
from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the 
Dowd Room in the Cohon 
Center. This is a great op-
portunity for students 
to convey their thoughts 
regarding a multitude of 
issues to their represen-
tatives — from Dining 
Services to how an intern-
ship is structured in con-
junction with a student’s 
academics. The Academic 
Affairs Committee is also 
hosting an Open Forum 
this Friday in Doherty Hall 
1212 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. 
Here, students can chat 
with senators concerning 
issues such as the new 
course policies or ensur-
ing a better, smoother, 
and more informed course 
registration process. Don’t 
forget all the free swag 
you can get at our events 
and don’t forget to look 
for the Senate table in the 
Cohon Center or on the 
Cut this week.
In addition, this semes-
ter, the Student Senate is 
proud to announce that 
with over 40 represen-
tatives in Senate, this is 
undoubtedly the most di-
versified Senate in many 
semesters and we encour-
age even more students 
to participate and express 
their thoughts and ideas 
to help improve any and 
every aspect of life here at 
Carnegie Mellon.
a skill set suitable to the 
new economic scene. In-
stead, he believes that this 
is where government poli-
cies should step in, citing 
the example of coal miners 
who have been without 
jobs.
“It’s not [the coal 
miners’] fault that coal 
can now be done with. 
. .more equipment, that 
natural gas has come into 
being, that solar and wind 
[are making advance-
ments], and that we now 
know that coal leads to 
climate problems,” Kamlet 
explains. He is adamant 
that government policies 
need to recognize this, 
rather then blame their 
challenges on a lack of 
diligence on the displaced 
workers’ part.
Kamlet disagrees 
with President Trump on 
the solution to the coal 
miners’ plight — he makes 
it clear that it is not to ig-
nore climate change and 
revive the old coal indus-
try, as the President has 
stated. Rather, it is to have 
public policies that, as he 
put it, “as we create great 
wealth as a country...make 
sure that everybody gets 
at least an adequate piece 
of the pie.”
Kamlet details several 
policies that could be in 
place to ease the transi-
tion for workers displaced 
or otherwise affected by 
technology. These include 
a robust tax system that 
raises the standard of 
living for everyone, the 
earned income tax credit, 
an adequate minimum 
wage, universal basic 
income, and wage insur-
ance.
Kamlet wants the 
younger generation to 
understand that despite 
the emphasis on Science, 
Technology, Engineering, 
and Mathematics (STEM), 
the future will require 
much more than just 
STEM skills — skills in so-
cial and emotional inter-
actions will likely become 
more and more important 
in the future, as laid out in 
his New American Dream. 
This book proposes ideas 
such as paying people 
for “tasks of love” — tak-
ing care of those in need, 
according to a university 
press release.
This semester, Kamlet 
is co-teaching a seminar 
class on inequality, which 
he hopes will give stu-
dents a chance to discuss 
important issues, expose 
them to the humanities 
departments, allow them 
to have small-group dis-
cussions, and help them 
get to know Carnegie 
Mellon faculty.

AUTOMATION, from A1
The crowd was teeming 
with fans and admirers, and 
with such exuberance in the 
room, the questions were 
varied and interesting. 
Neistat was able to 
elaborate further on how 
having children and a fam-
ily has motivated him, how 
he deals with stress, and 
what his future plans look 
like. Activities Board mem-
bers had to cut him off from 
answering more questions, 
and afterward, he hung 
around to chat with stu-
dents and take photos.
This lecture was 
organized by the Activi-
ties Board as a part of Geek 
Week, an annual obser-
vance to “celebrate being 
the geeks that we are.” 
Other activities included 
Harry Potter Trivia, laser 
tag, and showings of Thor: 
Ragnarok.
The Activities Board 
strives to “represent a va-
riety of topics and genres” 
with “all of the commit-
tees work[ing] together to 
present a broad range of 
events to meet the needs of 
the campus community.” 
Though Geek Week 
was catered towards proud 
campus “geeks,” the Activi-
ties Board continues to or-
ganize events for all, from 
comedy shows, to concerts, 
to lectures. If Geek Week 
wasn’t your cup of tea, keep 
an eye out for the next Ac-
tivities Board event. You 
might not want to miss it.

Truth behind Lady Doritos and gendered products
Doritos has chips for every-
one. If you like to stick to the 
classics, you can kick back with 
some nacho cheese Doritos. If 
you’re craving something spicy, 
you can treat yourself to sweet 
chili heat Doritos. And if you’re 
a woman, you might have your 
own Doritos sometime soon!
The internet has recently 
latched onto the idea that Dori-
tos will be coming out with a 
line tailored for women. Ac-
cording to The New York Times, 
the rumor traces back to an in-
terview with Indra Nooyi, the 
CEO of Dorito’s parent company 
PepsiCo. During an interview 
on the “Freaknomics Radio” 
podcast, she said that women 
ate Doritos differently from 
men — apparently, they “don’t 
like to crunch too loudly in pub-
lic, and they don’t lick their fin-
gers generously, and they don’t 
like to pour the little broken 
pieces and the flavor into their 
mouth.”
After prompting from the 
interviewer, she continued, “It’s 
not a male and female thing as 
much as, ‘Are there snacks for 
women that can be designed 
and packaged differently?’ And 
yes, we are looking at it, and 
we’re getting ready to launch a 
bunch of them soon.” She 
completed the train 
of thought by 
posing the 
question, 
“And how 
can you 
put [the 
bag of 
Doritos] 
in a purse? 
Because 
women love 
to carry a snack 
in their purse.”
Days after the 
podcast aired, The 
Sun published 
an article un-
der the head-
line “Dori-
tos firm 
to launch 
crisps for 
WOMEN 
because 
they 
don’t like 
crunching 
loudly or 
licking their 
fingers, boss 
reveals.” In less 
than a week, a few ca-
sual comments became 
purported fact, and the 
media frenzy began.
People flocked to 
Twitter to express their 
amusement, outrage, 
and amused outrage. 
Several women 
expressed how 
much they 
loved licking 
that sweet, 
sweet Dorito 
dust off their fin-
gers. Others lamented 
how they want equal pay, but 
society gives them “Lady Dori-
tos” instead. Eventually, the of-
ficial Doritos Twitter was forced 
to make a statement: “We al-
ready have Doritos for women 
— they’re called Doritos, and 
they’re loved by millions.”
So no, you won’t be seeing 
“Lady Doritos” in stores anytime 
soon. But it’s not surprising that 
so many people believed they 
might, since there are already 
hundreds of unnecessarily gen-
dered products lining shelves 
all over the world. Some high-
lights include Bic’s Pens For 
Her, Q-tips: Men’s Ultimate 
Multi-Tool, Woman in Charge 
Earbuds, Dude Wipes, Girly Girl 
Binoculars, and Man Grenade 
Bath Blasters.
Even if the packaging doesn’t 
explicitly say “For Men” or “For 
Women,” a product can still be 
gendered. Companies convey 
gender with colors, shapes, pat-
terns, images, and more. Prod-
ucts made for girls use the color 
pink, round edges, circles, light 
lines, and floral patterns. On 
the other hand, products for 
guys use dark, intense colors. 
They tend toward square edges 
and thick lines. Oftentimes, 
a shopper can determine the 
targeted gender with a single 
glance at a product.
As marketing becomes gen-
dered, the products themselves 
become specific to a gender. 
Princess dolls and kitchen sets 
are almost always targeted at 
girls, while racecars and ac-
tion figures belong to boys. Al-
though never stated outright, 
the message is clear. Girls are 
expected to be dainty, passive, 
and pretty. Boys are expected 
to be tough, aggressive, and 
strong. These gender roles are 
outdated and sexist. So why do 
companies still use them?
One could argue that 
capitalism drives most things 
in this economy, including the 
“semmingly innocent” gender-
ing of daily products. Compa-
nies discovered that if they seg-
ment the market into boys and 
girls, they can sell more ver-
sions of the same product. For 
example, if a company’s build-
ing blocks were plain colors, 
Timmy and Tina could play with 
them together, which means 
their parents would only have to 
buy one set. On the other hand, 
if one set was pink and the oth-
er was camouflage, the parents 
are more likely to buy two sets, 
one for each of their children.
Furthermore, gendered mar-
keting allows companies to tack 
on a “sexist surcharge.” Women 
often have to pay more than 
men for the same basic prod-
ucts. For certain products, es-
pecially hygiene products, the 
difference can be as high as 
fifty percent. Customers are so 
hardwired to go to their gen-
der’s section of the store that 
they never thought to check the 
prices on the other side.
Of course, gendered mar-
keting can also backfire. If a 
company markets their product 
too aggressively towards one 
gender, then “gender contami-
nation” can occur. According 
to Forbes, this phenomenon is 
when a gender avoids buying a 
certain product because of its 
association with the other gen-
der. For example, men refused 
to drink Diet Coke because they 
associated the drink with wom-
en. It wasn’t until Coke came 
out with the “more mascu-
line” Coke Zero that they 
were able to entice men 
toward the zero calo-
rie drink.
With increasing 
scrutiny of “gender 
contamination,” 
and the rise of gen-
der equality, peo-
ple have started to 
protest the gender 
segregation in stores, 
occasionally threaten-
ing to boycott if the store 
does not remove the gen-
dered la-
bels. In 
more 
ways 
than one, 
market seg-
mentation is 
becoming less 
profitable.
Where the mon-
ey goes, the compa-
nies follow. In the 
near future, we will 
likely see companies 
abandon the practice of 
gendering products. Al-
ready, stores such as Tar-
get are receiving positive 
media attention for remov-
ing boy and girl labels on toys. 
But it’s a slow process. There’s a 
complex web of factors 
holding gendered 
marketing in 
place — tra-
dition, capi-
talism, and 
of course, sex-
ism. These forces 
all have a strong hold 
on the business world, and CEOs 
are unlikely to turn to social jus-
tice issues and disrupt the “way 
things have always been.” Most 
of the time, companies are un-
willing to change unless their 
customers force them to.
While a snarky tweet won’t 
end gendered marketing, it 
could make it less accepted, 
and that’s a step in the right 
direction.

What do you think of when 
you hear the words “Carnegie 
Mellon University?”
Phrases such as “tech school,” 
“computer science,” and “stress 
culture” come to mind, as well 
as “art school,” “drama,” and 
“Broadway.” When I visited Carn-
egie Mellon as a prospective stu-
dent, I sat in McConomy Audito-
rium packed with high schoolers 
and their parents who were in the 
process of making important life 
decisions. The speaker ended his 
introductory remarks by touting 
how Carnegie Mellon was both a 
peer of the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology (MIT) and The 
Julliard School.
When I ?rst told my friends 
and family that I would be spend-
ing the next four years of my 
life at Carnegie Mellon, the ?rst 
words that came out of their 
mouths were: “You’re studying 
computer science?” When I said 
no, they continued: “So engineer-
ing then?” No again. “Oh, you’re 
doing art, right?”
Nope. I applied to the Dietrich 
College of Humanities and Social 
Sciences, undeclared and unde-
cided about what I wanted to do 
with my future. After taking my 
required freshman courses and 
discovered that I love to write, I 
declared as a Professional Writ-
ing major in the Department of 
English.
As a student on campus, I have 
experienced different reactions to 
being a humanities major. I have 
heard people talking about how 
Dietrich is the underling of the 
university. I’ve seen derogatory 
memes of the Facebook page, 
“Carnegie Mellon Memes for 
Spicy Teens.” Even among my 
own friends, I have experienced 
“major-shaming,” complaints 
about how I don’t take midterms 
and ?nals or spend six hours on 
coding assignments (news?ash: I 
have done both).
But when I explain to my 
friends what being a major in the 
humanities is like, some begin to 
understand that different ?elds 
simply warrant different learning 
structures. Small things that I’m 
used to — like 60 pages of read-
ing a night, ten-page essays, and 
taking small classes that require 
attendance — are foreign to many 
non-humanities students.
According to Carnegie Mellon’s 
most recent admissions for the 
2017-2018 freshman class, Dietri-
ch is the second largest college at 
the university, with 303 enrollees 
behind the College of Engineer-
ing’s 434. However, only a small 
percentage of students in Dietrich 
fall under the “humanities” half 
of the college: the Departments 
of English, History, Modern Lan-
guages, and Philosophy. Of the 
Fall 2017 admitted class, only 15 
percent were in the humanities, 
while nine percent were undecid-
ed, and the remaining 74 percent 
were in non-humanities majors 
such as information systems, psy-
chology, and statistics and data 
science.
Dietrich is renowned for its in-
terdisciplinary studies, merging 
technology and humanities with 
majors like Statistics and Machine 
Learning (a joint major with the 
School of Computer Science), 
and the new minor Humanities 
Analytics from the Department of 
English that incorporates studies 
in computer science and robot-
ics. The Department of Statistics 
and Data Science continues to 
expand, becoming one of the fast-
est-growing statistics programs in 
the country.
All these developments are 
great, and I’m glad that Dietrich 
is a space where students can 
combine their varying interests. 
However, as previously argued 
in The Tartan, the continuing 
“STEM-i?cation” of Dietrich, 
while welcome and progressive, 
could threaten the more tradi-
tional humanities departments of 
the college.
The humanities community at 
Carnegie Mellon is small, but it 
is rare to ?nd people who are not 
fully passionate about what they 
study. There is also less of the 
stress culture that is ubiquitous 
in other ?elds on campus. Yes, 
students are overwhelmed with 
schoolwork, clubs, and other re-
sponsibilities like all students, 
but there is less competition, less 
of a need to brag about how little 
sleep you had last night, which 
Silicon Valley internship you got, 
or when the last time you left the 
architecture studio was.
I have highlighted many dif-
ferences between the humanities 
and other ?elds at Carnegie Mel-
lon, particularly STEM ?elds, but 
my purpose is not to de?ne the 
large chasm between them. We 
are all students at the same uni-
versity that appreciates a wide 
range of disciplines. But in order 
to create a community that ap-
preciates one another, we must 
?rst understand the differences 
in that community.

Once again, the flu strikes. 
The Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC) spokeswoman Kristen 
Nordlund warns the U.S. that this 
flu season won’t stop at the hun-
dreds of deaths. “We have not hit 
our peak yet, unfortunately,” she 
states. “There is still likely many 
more weeks to go.” This marks 
the current flu strain as one of 
the deadliest in recent times.
What should be seen as a giant 
red flag, encouraging us to recon-
sider how health is handled in 
the U.S., is being almost de-legit-
imized by people who should be 
helping lead our nation. Gloria 
Copeland, televangelist and spir-
itual advisor for President Don-
ald Trump, gave us the health 
advice of the century in a viral 
Facebook video:
“Jesus Himself is our flu shot. 
He redeemed us from the curse of 
the flu.”
This is not the first time Co-
peland has spoken out about 
reaching out for medical help. 
In 2004, Copeland’s message 
reached Bonnie Parker, who 
passed at the age of 59 from 
cancer. Parker’s daughter, Kristy 
Beach, later found journals which 
recorded what her mother had 
heard Copeland and her husband 
say on television. She came to the 
conclusion that “if she went to a 
doctor, it was a sin [because] you 
didn’t believe enough if you did 
[seek medical help].”
At first glance, this statement 
can be dismissed as naive and af-
fecting very few people. While I 
have faith that a sizeable fraction 
of America knows better than to 
take heed of this statement, dev-
astation can occur if even one 
person does. People with great 
influence and a platform that can 
reach thousands of people, such 
as Copeland, have the capacity 
to take lives. In a time in which 
the disease is far more conta-
gious than cancer, this mental-
ity does not affect just those who 
enact her ill-formed medical ad-
vice. Even if someone decides 
to value the words of a primary 
care provider over a televangelist 
on television, illnesses may still 
come charging. However, unlike 
cancer, the flu is contagious. One 
person’s diagnosis does not stop 
at that one person; it can multi-
ply to a far greater population.
Yes, we should maintain a 
healthy level of skepticism when 
it comes to what we hear, and 
words from “Big Pharma” are no 
exception. However, skepticism 
should not be confused with the 
ruthless dismissal of anything 
that contradicts our paradigm. 
Skepticism is questioning the 
potential benefits of taking a new 
drug that allegedly helps with 
psoriasis. Ruthless denial is the 
epitome of arrogance, believing 
one’s quick Google search su-
persedes any doctor’s expertise 
crafted after years of education 
and experience.
Furthermore, claiming 
“Jesus Himself is our flu 
shot” is hubris at its finest. 
Much like in Parker’s 
case, Copeland’s mes-
sage discourages 
people from seek-
ing medical help, 
even if the illness 
is treatable. No-
body wants to 
believe that 
they are do-
ing something 
inadequately, 
and by stat-
ing that lack 
of faith ended a life, people like 
Copeland are preying on the vul-
nerable. These vulnerable people 
want to have autonomy, and 
Copeland is giving the false pre-
tense by assuring one’s faith or 
prayer alone is the cure. Whether 
Copeland believes in this mes-
sage or not is irrelevant; her mes-
sage is potentially disastrous for 
modern society.
Furthermore, herd immu-
nization protects not only the 
vaccinated but also those who 
cannot be vaccinated. Vaccines 
don’t eliminate the chance of be-
ing stricken with the respective 
illness, but the likelihood of an 
outbreak does greatly reduce if 
the majori-ty of the population 
has done 
their 
part in — you 
guessed it — get-
ting their vac-
cines. Infants un-
der the age of six 
months are too young 
to be vaccinated and are 
already more susceptible to 
falling ill. Lethal egg allergies 
or those who have had Guillain-
Barré Syndrome are both highly 
discouraged from getting the flu 
shot. If the decision to vaccinate 
only involved those making the 
choice, it wouldn’t be as big of 
a problem. However, one’s deci-
sions can affect those all around.
The statistics for vaccines 
don’t look promising. The 
effectiveness rate is as low as 17 
percent, contrasting to the usual 
40 to 60 percent. The traditional 
manufacturing of vaccines with 
eggs has, instead of cultivating 
a weakened version of the flu vi-
rus, altered the strain altogether. 
However, approxi-
mately 80 percent 
of children who 
died from the 
flu were not 
vaccinated. 
Even if the 
vaccine isn’t 
nearly as ef-
fective as it 
usually is, 
it still has 
been sug-
gested that it 
can lessen the 
impact of the 
flu.
The num-
ber of influ-
enza-related 
pediatric deaths 
is on the rise, and 
officials don’t see an end 
to the flu epidemic coming any-
time soon. Even if you, like Cope-
land, haven’t gotten vaccinated 
for the flu and are safe, keep in 
mind that this case does not deny 
the damage the flu has brought 
this season. Your overconfidence 
may come at a price.

In keeping with recent 
tradition, Republicans have 
found a new way to undermine 
federal institutions. This time, it 
comes in the form of #releaset-
hememo. The hashtag is a semi-
viral attempt to stir controversy 
surrounding the FBI and Justice 
Department probes 
into Russian in-
terference in 
the 2016 
election 
cycle. 
Namely, 
that con-
troversy 
should suppos-
edly invalidate the Muel-
ler investigation. There are two 
main things to look into here: 
First, the memo itself, since it has 
been released, and second, why 
the individuals involved have 
such terrible credibility to begin 
with, and why that means that 
the memo should be ignored.
The memo alleges that the FBI 
ignored procedural standards and 
obtained and utilized British 
intelligence — fund-
ed by the Democrat-
ic National 
Committee (DNC) — while inves-
tigating former Trump campaign 
of?cial Carter Page. It also alleges 
that the Justice Department failed 
to disclose that the information was 
funded by Democrats in obtain-
ing a warrant. Rod Rosenstein, the 
Deputy Attorney General in charge 
of oversight of the Mueller probe, 
is also implicated in calling for a re-
newal of the surveillance warrant 
on Page.
So, on the surface, it does look 
incriminating. Presented only this 
evidence and no context, one might 
think that the FBI and Justice De-
partment deliberately sought to sur-
veil a Trump campaign of?cial with 
the direct backing of the DNC. There 
are numerous reasons this 
conclusion is inaccurate.
For one, as evi-
denced by the yet-to-
be-released Demo-
cratic 
response 
memo, 
the Republican memo apparently 
deliberately selects this evidence 
while ignoring other information 
that would completely invalidate 
the aforementioned concerns. Espe-
cially when considering that Trump 
is now holding up the release of the 
Democratic memo, both memos are 
clearly politically motivated. Those 
motivations are fairly cut-and-dry: 
Trump and the Republicans want 
to remove Mueller, and Democrats 
want him to carry out his investi-
gation unimpeded. So, then, why 
should we not trust the Republicans 
in this situation?
Well, it really comes down to one 
person (besides President Trump): 
Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA). Nunes 
has gained a reputation for shady 
hyper-partisan political actions 
over the years, most recently in at-
tempting to justify Trump’s ludi-
crous claim that President Obama 
wiretapped him during the 2016 
campaign. Nunes released commu-
nications between Obama’s former 
national security adviser Susan 
Rice and the intelligence commu-
nity, in which Rice asked for records 
of Trump transition team of?cials 
who had connections to foreigners 
already being surveilled. The key 
word there is transition. Rice did 
not attempt to surveil the Trump 
campaign. Rather, after Trump won 
the election, Rice sought to make 
sure transition team of?cials were 
not compromised. As we learned 
months later, several Trump cam-
paign and administration of?cials 
have been charged with crimes re-
lated to Russian interference in the 
election. Michael Flynn, who served 
as Trump’s national security adviser 
until his ousting, pleaded guilty to 
lying to the Mueller team about cor-
respondences with Russian of?cials. 
Michael Flynn was Nunes’ mentor. 
They shared a penchant for con-
spiracy theories under the Obama 
administration, and Nunes contin-
ues to do so under Trump, even with 
Flynn gone.
That lack of credibility surround-
ing Nunes, as well as the FBI and 
Justice Department’s vocal displea-
sure with the release of the GOP 
memo, should be red ?ags to all 
Americans. The memo is just an-
other part of a continued effort to 
undermine the Mueller probe and to 
protect Trump. This likely will not be 
the last Republican effort to do so.
  As someone who was sexu-
ally harassed in the past, I know 
about the inner-pain that vic-
tims and survivors experience.  
But, as someone who spent five 
years as a counselor and a thera-
pist working in the fields of al-
coholism, drug addiction, and 
mental health, I want to share 
my observations and research 
findings about another form of 
sexual abuse.
Our country needs to start 
having a conversation about 
the plight of incest victims and 
survivors.  It is my opinion that 
these people suffer more deeply 
and profoundly than victims 
and survivors of other forms of 
abuse.  Their self-hatred, self-
loathing, and self-blame are so 
severe and extreme that some 
of them constantly smile even 
when it is not appropriate to do 
so.
Experienced counselors and 
therapists will tell you that they 
do this as a way to hide and cover 
up how dirty, disgusting, and 
miserable they feel deep within 
themselves.  They will also tell 
you that very few of them ever 
have a healthy, “functional,” 
and happy romantic relation-
ship.  Incest victims also suffer 
from very high rates of suicide, 
anorexia nervosa, and bulimia.
Our society needs to take the 
next step and try to eradicate 
this problem from existence.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: SEXUAL ABUSE SURVIVORS
LETTER TO THE EDITOR: STANDING UP TO ABUSERS
I believe that most of us 
Americans have been victims of 
bullying and/or some form of 
abuse at some time in or lives.  
As a former counselor and thera-
pist, I worked with and tried to 
help many victims of everyday 
bullying, as well as various oth-
er forms of abuse.    
   I found that their biggest prob-
lem and issue they dealt with 
was that they did not stand up 
to their bullies and abusers.  The 
best question that I have ever 
heard a counselor or therapist 
ask their clients and patients rel-
ative to this was the following:
“What parts of yourself don’t 
you love that allows you to let 
this bully or abuser  to continue 
to mistreat and abuse you?”
This question prompted many 
people to ?nally make some 
change in their lives and to walk 
away from and leave their abus-
ers.

On Feb. 7, autonomous 
vehicle competitors Uber 
and Waymo reached a sur-
prise settlement on their 
?fth day in court, over alle-
gations that Uber had used 
Waymo’s trade secrets in 
its autonomous vehicle de-
velopment. Waymo, owned 
by Google’s parent com-
pany Alphabet, was paid 
about $245 million in Uber 
company equity.
After Waymo ?rst ?led 
their suit against Uber in 
February of 2017, some 
speculated that the con-
sequences for Uber could 
be as dire as the end of 
their autonomous vehicle 
program or a much larger 
settlement than the one 
that closed the case. At the 
center of the controversy 
was Anthony Levandowski, 
a former Google engineer 
and leader in autonomous 
vehicle research, whom 
Waymo accused of leaking 
company secrets to Uber.
Waymo alleged that, 
before Levandowski left 
the company in Jan. 2016, 
he had downloaded 14,000 
con?dential ?les and docu-
ments concerning the de-
velopment of Waymo’s self-
driving cars — speci?cally, 
the design of Light Detec-
tion And Ranging (LiDAR), 
the spinning cylindrical 
sensors on top of self-driv-
ing cars which they use to 
“see.” LiDAR emits millions 
of lasers per second and 
measures how quickly they 
take to re?ect off of objects 
in order to determine their 
distance from the car.
After Levandowski left 
the company, he started an 
autonomous trucking com-
pany called Otto. In Aug. 
2016, Uber purchased Otto 
in a $680 million deal.
Waymo contended that 
Uber’s acquisition of Otto 
was just a front for Uber 
to use Google’s research, 
claiming that former Uber 
CEO Travis Kalanick had 
been in talks with Levan-
dowski while he was still 
working for Google.
Uber has maintained 
their innocence throughout 
the case. As current Uber 
CEO Dana Khosrowshahi 
put it in a statement re-
leased last Friday, “we do 
not believe that any trade 
secrets made their way 
from Waymo to Uber, nor 
do we believe that Uber has 
used any of Waymo’s pro-
prietary information in its 
self-driving technology. We 
are taking steps with Way-
mo to ensure our LiDAR 
and software represents 
just our good work.”
Uber had decidedly 
distanced themselves from 
Levandowski. He was not a 
defendant in the case, but 
is currently being investi-
gated by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice for leaking 
Google’s trade secrets. He 
was demoted from being 
the head of the Advanced 
Technologies Group at Uber 
last April and ?red last May, 
after failing to turn in re-
quested court documents. 
Throughout the case, he 
repeatedly avoided answer-
ing incriminating questions 
by invoking his ?fth amend-
ment right.
During the testimony, 
Kalanick claimed that he 
reminded a miffed Google 
CEO Larry Page that “your 
people are not your [in-
tellectual property] IP,” 
according to Gizmodo. His 
quip embodies two obser-
vations about this case: It 
was a very melodramatic 
ordeal for both of the Sili-
con Valley giants, and it 
may have future implica-
tions for companies who 
are at the frontiers of new 
technology.
Waymo protected their 
LiDAR technology using 
trade secrets, de?ned by 
the U.S. Patent and Trade-
mark Of?ce as intellectual 
property which can give 
a company a commercial 
edge over others. Trade se-
crets are protected by U.S. 
law, but as Wharton Man-
agement Professor John 
Paul McDuffe points out, 
they are not typically a reli-
able way to secure IP. Tech-
nology is a hard secret to 
keep when products using 
it are available for public 
consumption. If Waymo’s 
case can slow down Uber’s 
autonomous vehicle devel-
opment, then trade secrets 
may become more reliable.
Trade secrets may pro-
tect IP — but, this comes 
at a cost. The particulars of 
how autonomous vehicles 
work are not known to the 
public, and have been re-
dacted in the court docu-
ments involved in this case. 
As Santa Clara Law Profes-
sor Dorothy Glancey states, 
making good policy about 
autonomous vehicles may 
prove to be a challenge if 
certain information must 
be hidden from the public.

New superdense wood is stronger, lighter than steel
A newly developed type 
of compacted wood has 
been proven by researchers 
to be incredibly dense and as 
strong as steel.
To create the ultra-
compacted material, a 
team of engineers, led by 
researchers from the Uni-
versity of Maryland, soaked 
a block of wood in a boiling 
solution of water, sodium 
hydroxide, and sodium sul-
?te. Then, the researchers 
squeezed the wood between 
hot metal plates, at extreme-
ly high pressure. Further-
more, the chemicals used to 
process the wood wouldn’t 
pollute the environment.
Researchers determined 
that the ultra-compacted 
wood was 11.5 times stron-
ger than natural wood, by 
testing how well it could 
withstand being stretched 
without breaking. 
The highly compact-
ed wood was also dense 
enough to stop a bullet and 
lighter than steel.
The lightweight wood 
could have many applica-
tions in manufacturing — 
for example, to produce 
vehicles that are lighter, 
and therefore more fuel-
ef?cient.

Chemical in cave?sh brains could help study sleep variation
Blind Mexican cave?sh 
sleep only one-and-a-half 
hours per day, on average. 
Researchers from Florida 
Atlantic University believe 
this is because the cave?sh 
brain contains high amounts 
of a chemical called hypo-
cretin/orexin (HCRT).
HCRT helps regulate 
hunger and sleep cycles. The 
cave?sh, which have no eyes, 
have far higher amounts of 
HCRT than related ?sh who 
have eyes and live closer to 
the water’s surface - roughly 
twice as much. Increasing 
the HCRT signaling made 
cave?sh sleep more, but had 
virtually no effect on other 
freshwater ?sh.
“These ?ndings suggest 
that differences in Hypocre-
tin production may explain 
variation in sleep between 
animal species, or even be-
tween individual people,” 
said Alex Keene,  an author 
of the study. “It may also 
provide important insight 
into how we might build a 
brain that does not need to 
sleep.”

SpaceX launches its Falcon Heavy rocket on Feb. 6
Private aerospace com-
pany SpaceX successfully 
launched its Falcon Heavy 
rocket for the ?rst time on 
Feb. 6 from the Kennedy 
LC-39A SpaceX South Texas 
Launch Site.
The Falcon Heavy, 
essentially consisting 
of three rocket boosters 
strapped together, is the 
most powerful rocket to 
launch since NASA’s Sat-
urn V. SpaceX hopes that 
like Saturn V, which sent 
astronauts to the moon, 
the Falcon Heavy will shoot 
humans into space.
One of SpaceX’s most 
important goals is to make 
all its rockets reusable. 
This means that after each 
launch, the rocket boosters 
have to return to Earth, and 
land safely. In last Tuesday’s 
launch, two of the Falcon 
Heavy’s three boosters land-
ed successfully.
SpaceX’s goal in produc-
ing reusable rockets is to 
signi?cantly lower the cost 
of space travel. They are cur-
rently working on another 
rocket, the Big Falcon Rock-
et (BFR), that they intend to 
use to send humans to Mars.

Paleontoloigists discover early spiders had tails
EMMA FLICKINGER
Asssitant SciTech Editor
A previously undiscovered 
prehistoric arachnid has been found 
in the Myanmar rainforest, trapped 
in 100-million-year old amber. The 
arachnid fossil looks like a spider, but 
has a long tail — called a ?agellum.
The arachnids date to the Creta-
ceous period —  when Tyrannosaurus 
rex lived —  and display a combina-
tion of prehistoric and modern char-
acteristics. They are similiar to spi-
ders in the sense that they have fangs 
and  appendages to spin silk. The 
researchers who discovered the spe-
cies named it Chimerarachne yingi, 
“Chimerarachne” after the mytho-
logical chimera, said to be made of 
parts from different animals. “We 
have known for a decade or so that 
spiders evolved from arachnids that 
had tails, more than 315 million 
years ago,” said study coauthor Dr. 
Russell Garwood of the University of 
Manchester. “We’ve not found fossils 
before that showed this, and so ?nd-
ing this now was a huge (but really 
fantastic) surprise.”
Four Chimerarachne specimens 
were found. They had spinnerets to 
make silk, like modern spiders do, 
but the researchers believe that it 
did not use them to weave webs. The 
function of the tail is unknown. Al-
though, according to Dr. Paul Selden 
— a paleontologist University of 
Kansas — “Any sort of ?agelliform 
appendage tends to be like an anten-
na. It’s for sensing the environment. 
Animals that have a long whippy tail 
tend to have it for sensory purposes.”
The fossilized creatures are almost 
5.5 millimeters in length and are all 
male.
“Chimerarachne ?lls the gap 
between Palaeozoic arachnids with 
tails known from rocks (uraraneids) 
and true spiders, and the fact the 
new fossils have been wonderfully 
preserved in Burmese amber has al-
lowed an unmatched detail of study,” 
said Dr Ricardo Perez-De-La Fuente, 
of the Oxford Museum of Natural 
History. “There are many surprises 
still waiting to be unearthed in the 
fossil record. Like most unexpected 
?ndings in palaeontology, it probably 
brings more questions than answers, 
but questions are what keep things 
exciting and push the boundaries of 
science,” he said.
“Though it isn’t probable, it’s 
possible that some Chimerarachne 
are still alive in the rainforest today. 
“We haven’t found them, but some of 
these forests aren’t that well-studied, 
and it’s only a tiny creature,” Selden 
said.
Two studies were published in 
Nature Ecology & Evolution on Feb. 5.

The Tartans improved 
in the second half from the 
?rst, shooting 59.4 percent 
from the ?eld after shoot-
ing 33.3 percent in the ?rst 
half. They ended with a 47.5 
shooting percentage on the 
game, while Emory shot 
44.6 percent. The Tartans 
were hurt by their turn-
overs, committing ?ve more 
than Emory.
Against the University 
of Rochester Yellowjack-
ets, the Tartans fought off 
a comeback by the visit-
ing team to take the win. 
Though in this game the 
Tartans were on the de-
fensive, it seemed like the 
game was going to end like 
it did against Emory, with a 
shot in the last second tak-
ing the victory from the Tar-
tans. On Sunday, however, 
the review waived a shot 
taken after buzzer, and the 
Tartans held on to win.
Howarth led the team 
with 19 points, followed 
by McNeil with 13, Ehland 
with 11, and Maha with 10. 
McNeil recorded ?ve assists, 
while Maha hauled in ?ve 
steals. Henry led the team 
in rebounds, with nine.
The Tartans opened the 
?rst half with aggressive of-
fense, scoring the ?rst seven 
points of the game. The 
Yellowjackets closed the 
half with an 8–2 run and 
went into halftime with the 
score 36–32.
For most of the 
second half, the Tartans 
maintained their lead. The 
Yellowjackets regrouped 
to score 16 straight points, 
taking the lead 68–66. A 
McNeil layup with two 
minutes left ended the 
Yellowjackets’ run and tied 
the game. With 1:30 left, 
two free throws by Howarth 
gave the Tartans the lead, 
and they held on to win 
70–68.
The Tartans’ 39.7 percent 
shooting was lower than the 
Yellowjackets’ 48.1 percent, 
but made up for it by taking 
16 more shots. 
After the two games, the 
Tartans move to 6–16 on

play. They will next play the

However, the Eagles 
bene?ted from three times 
as many assists, twice as 
many second chance points, 
and 17 bench points to the 
Tartans’ six.
On Sunday afternoon, 
the Tartans faced off against 
the University of Rochester 
Yellowjackets at Skibo 
Gymnasium, falling 70–53.
Filiere led the team in 
points, scoring 21 points, 
with 11 of them coming in 
the fourth quarter, She also 
added ?ve steals. Ochsner 
led the team with seven 
rebounds.
In the ?rst quarter, 
the Yellowjackets started 
quickly, jumping to an 11–4 
lead. The Tartans played 
poorly in the quarter, 
shooting only 23.5 percent, 
and trailed 20–12 going 
into the ?rst break.
The Yellowjackets 
maintained their 
momentum in the second 
quarter, building their 
lead to 21 points with a 
17–4 run. At the end of the 
quarter, a three-pointer 
from sophomore Megan 
Jaeb cut the Tartans’ de?cit 
and made the score 40–16 
going into the half.
Unlike the ?rst half, the 
third quarter was much 
more balanced, with the 
two teams trading baskets. 
However, the Tartans were 
not able to build enough 
momentum to spark a 
comeback run.
Trailing 56–34 at the 
start of the fourth quarter, 
the Tartans’ improved 
immensely on their 
ef?ciency, shooting 43.8 
percent from the ?eld. 
However, that was not 
enough to stop the fast-
paced Yellowjackets of-
fense, who held their lead 
to win 70–53.
The Tartan’s overall 
shooting percentage 
averaged to 39.1 percent, 
not far off the Yellowjackets’ 
40.3 percent. The 
Yellowjackets recorded 
three times as many assists, 
twice as many second

My parents love watch-
ing the Olympics. Doesn’t 
matter what season it is, 
winter or summer. They’ll 
watch it all, and for a while, 
when I was a little kid, I 
really didn’t understand the 
appeal of watching a bunch 
of athletes that nobody had 
ever heard of play sports 
(how do you just become 
a ski jumper or a curler? 
Where do they even ?nd 
people for that?)
I still watched the events 
with them, and, after my 
sister got older and was 
swimming 
competi-
tively, it 
became 
a big 
event to 
watch the 
summer 
games, be-
cause, as 
a family, 
we ?nally 
had a rea-
son to pay 
attention! 
My sister 
was doing 
the same 
thing that these big-name 
athletes like Missy Franklin 
and Michael Phelps were 
doing. It was the Super 
Bowl of swimming, so we all 
sat as a family and watched. 
I don’t know if that has any-
thing to do with why I love 
the Olympics now, though, 
but the family sentiment 
probably plays a part in it.
So why do I love the 
Olympics? I’ve thought 
about it and boiled it down 
to a few basic ideas. The 
?rst is less about sports, 
and more about advertis-
ing, I guess? Look at the 
Super Bowl, though. The 
spectacle and smoke and 
mirrors to make everything 
look much more impressive 
than it is in?ltrates every 
aspect of a pretty normal 
football game between two 
good teams. It ruins the 
game for me because you 
hear the announcers talk 
about things that 
don’t make 
any sense, and there’s a 
bunch of narratives weaved 
into the game that don’t 
really have anything to do 
with football.
With the Olympics, at 
least to me, the spectacle 
and showmanship is con-
densed into the ?rst night 
of the opening ceremony, 
and then everyone wipes 
their hands off it, and it’s all 
about the sports. They get 
all the ridiculous pageantry 
and ?ash in when the host 
country does their opening 
ceremony, but after that 
it’s about the athletes and 
that’s what matters.
I also really enjoy watch-
ing sports that I’ve never 
heard of or know very 
little about. It’s a learning 
experience to piece together 
the exact rule set for a cross 
country skiing competi-
tion, and once you get the 
hang of it, you end up 
screaming at 
some German 
girl because 
she missed two 
of the targets 
she’s supposed 
to shoot, or 
you’re ?ip-
ping your 
lid because 
some snow-
boarder from 
Canada lands 
his tricks 
incredibly 
well.
That point 
ties in to 
watching 
the games 
with family, 
for sure. By 
the end of 
the night, 
you and your 
parents are experts in judg-
ing the ?gure skaters. You 
know just how to point your 
skates if you want to get the 
most distance on a ski jump. 
You can tell just what the 
American team needs to do 
to kick the snot out of any 
other curling team.
So enjoy the Olympics 
while they’re here, 
everybody. Grab some 
friends and make an 
evening out of it.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team 
welcomed two of their 
University Athletics Asso-
ciation (UAA) rivals, Emory 
University on Friday, Feb. 
9, and the University of 
Rochester on Sunday, Feb. 
11. The Tartans played two 
close games, dropping the 
?rst game to the Eagles 
82–80, and defeating the 
Yellowjackets 70–68.
On Friday against the 
Emory Eagles, the game was 
decided in the ?nal second. 
Trailing by seven points late 
in the second half, the Tar-
tans attempted a comeback, 
falling just short.
Sophomore Zach 
Howarth led the Tartans 
in scoring with 25 points.
Senior Ryan Maha and 
sophomore Colin McNeil 
both scored 14 points, and 
McNeil dished out a team-
high six assists. Juniors Seth 
Henry and Patrick Ehland 
hauled in eight rebounds 
apiece on the night.
The Eagles opened the 
game hot, scoring eight 
straight points. Later in 
the half, a 17–6 run by the 
Eagles extended their lead 
to 16 points. The Tartans 
scored the ?nal ?ve points 
of the half, including a 
three-pointer by Maha, 
going into halftime trailing 
37–29.
In the ?rst two minutes 
of the second half, Howarth 
scored two consecutive 
three-pointers to pull the 
Tartans within ?ve points 
off the lead, a taste of 
what was to come later in 
the half. Five minutes into 
the half, the Eagles’ lead 
was 12 points, but over 
the next four and a half 
minutes, the Tartans slowly 
made their way back into 
the game. A jumpshot by 
Howarth capped off a 13–5 
run, making the score 60–
56. The Eagles scored the 
next ?ve points to get their 
comfortable lead back, but 
the Tartans pushed again, 
scoring the next eight points 
to bring the team within 
one point, 65–64 with 5:50 
left to play.
With 1:39 left to play, the 
Eagles led by seven points, 
but the Tartans again rallied 
to score six straight points, a 
three-pointer by sophomore 
Coopers Williams bringing 
the score to 78–77 with 32 
seconds left.
Two free throws gave the 
Eagles a three-point lead, 
but three made free throws 
by Maha tied the game at 
80–80 with 13 seconds left 
in the game. A layup by the 
Eagles at 0.8 seconds lifted 
the visiting team to the win.

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team 
played two University 
Athletics Association (UAA) 
games this weekend: one on 
Friday, Feb. 9 versus Emory 
University, and another on 
Sunday, Feb. 11 against the 
University of Rochester.
Friday’s game against 
the Emory University Eagles 
was a thriller, decided 
in the ?nal seconds. For 
the Tartans, sophomore 
Katharine Higgins led the 
team scoring 21 points.
Sophomores Laurel 
Pereira and MaKayla Filiere 
each dropped 12 points. 
Sophomore Laura Och-
sner led the team with 
nine rebounds and three 
steals, while junior Jenn 
Mayberger’s team-high four 
assists brought her to 328 
assists in her career, a new 
school record.
The Tartans opened the 
game scoring seven straight 
points, including the ?rst 
?ve by Pereira and the ?nal 
13 points all coming from 
free throws. The Tartans 
stayed on their hot streak 
for the rest of the ?rst 
quarter with two more runs 
of 7–0 and 6–0 giving them 
a 22–11 lead at the break.
The Eagles began the 
second quarter with ?ve 
points to quickly cut the 
Tartans’ lead to six. Unlike 
the ?rst quarter, the second 
was relatively balanced with 
neither team dominating 
play. The Tartans led the 
game 39–30 going into half-
time.
In the third quarter, the 
Tartans led by as much as 
12 points, but the Eagles 
slowly began to inch their 
way towards the lead. A 
three-pointer at the buzzer 
brought the Eagles within 
three points with the score 
now 52–49.
Within the ?rst minute-
and-a-half of the fourth 
quarter, the Eagles tied the 
game at 54–54. The visiting 
team scored four straight 
points for a 58–54 lead, but 
the Tartans soon tied the 
game again. This continued 
throughout the quarter with 
the Eagles taking a small 
lead only for the Tartans to 
tie. With a minute left in 
the game and the Tartans 
down by two, missed shots 
by Filiere and Higgins gave 
the ball back to the Eagles 
who sealed their win with 
a layup with seven seconds 
left in the game.
The Tartans and the 
Eagles had similar ?eld 
goal percentages, 39.1 
percent and 40.3 percent, 
respectively.

Eagles topple Patriots to earn ?rst championship

For the ?rst time since 
the advent of the Super 
Bowl, the Philadelphia 
Eagles can ?nally claim their 
very own Lombardi trophy. 
Defeating the New England 
Patriots in Minneapolis, 
the Eagles cemented their 
victory 41-33 in a thrilling, 
offensively vibrant game. 
There was only one punt 
the entire game, and nearly 
every drive ended with a 
scoring play for both teams. 
With a cumulative 1,151 
total yards, this Super Bowl 
sets the mark for the largest 
number of yards in any NFL 
game ever, Super Bowl or 
otherwise.
The game was full of 
surprises, ranging from 
spectacular trick plays 
to dramatic fumbles. 
Tom Brady, constantly 
challenging the Eagles 
drive after drive, fum-
bled with less than three 
minutes left in the fourth 
quarter, essentially sealing 
the game for the Eagles. On 
the other side of the ?eld, 
late in the second quarter, 
Eagles quarterback Nick 
Foles successfully pulled 
off the “Philly Special” 
— a trick play involving 
three different players, a 
pass to the quarterback, 
and a vital fourth-down 
touchdown conversion. A 
similar play was attempted 
by the Patriots earlier in 
the quarter, but Brady 
was unable to make the 
reception.
For much of the game, 
defense was almost 
invisible, and most non-
scoring drives were ended 
by time running out or 
failure on the end of the 
offensive team, with both 
teams missing a ?eld 
goal early in the game. 
The Eagles were stopped 
multiple times on two-
point conversion attempts, 
and the Patriots missed an 
extra point, but 75 percent 
of the Eagles’ possessions 
ended in points of some 
kind, compared to only 
54 percent for the Patri-
ots. Both quarterbacks had 
career games, with Brady 
throwing over 500 yards 
and Foles averaging over 
eight yards per attempt, 
blowing the regular season 
statistic out of the water.
Coming down to the 
wire, with the Patriots 
surging forward, it was the 
Philadelphia defense who 
made the unlikely play of 
the game, sacking Brady 
and forcing a fumble. The 
Patriots managed one 
more drive in the game 
and came inches from 
completing a spectacular 
“Hail Mary” touchdown 
pass, reminiscent of an 
identical one at the end of 
another Super Bowl, ten 
years ago. Philadelphia was 
able to hold onto their lead 
for the franchise’s ?rst NFL 
championship.
Foles was named Super 
Bowl MVP, throwing for 
three touchdowns and 
receiving one. Brady the 
received the league honor 
before the game.

On Valentine’s Day
Dear Jade,
Valentine’s Day is coming up, and I already 
know it is going to SUCK. My friends are either 
pining for someone and being all mushy about 
it, or they’re in loving, committed relationships. 
And then you have me, still hurt from the last 
time I put my feelings out in the open and not 
in the mood to do it again. More importantly, 
I’ve somehow gotten pushed into a strange 
position where my friends keep turning to me 
for relationship advice even though I’ve never 
been in an actual relationship. Maybe I should 
feel honored or touched, but for the most part 
I’m starting to remember all these feelings 
that I don’t really wanna touch again in a long 
time. And I really don’t know how to get out of 
that headspace. Can you give me a single gal’s 
survival guide for Valentine’s Day?
Sincerely,
Somehow I’m Not Getting Love Ever
Dear SINGLE,
I know what it’s like to not want to think about 
love and to pretend those feelings just don’t exist. 
You’re still hurting and every other person that’s 
in a relationship seems like they’re only doing 
it to mock you. While you know this isn’t true 
and that the people you walk past on the street 
holding hands don’t know you exist, it still feels 
like a personal attack. I won’t lie to you and say 
that being single is the best thing ever, because 
it’s not fun after you’ve been taken through the 
wringer with love. But just because being single 
might not be all that fun for you right now, that 
doesn’t mean Valentine’s Day has to suck.
I’ve always been a fan of the holiday regardless 
of my relationship status. Take advantage of this 
day to wear your cutest pink and red outfit, go 
to Starbucks and get that pink drink, and fill your 
heart with the love you have for everyone around 
you, whether it’s friends or family. I love 
a lot of people and it’s nice to think about that on 
Valentine’s Day.
The single gal’s guide doesn’t always have to 
be a ten page guide on how to go out in your 
hottest outfit with all your single friends and post 
pics that will make your ex text you at 3 a.m. 
Sometimes it’s just reminding yourself that love 
exists outside of the person that broke your heart 
and remembering that you will find that again.
But if you decide to go down the going out route, 
a few drinks and a hot outfit helps too.

Jade Crockem | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Tiki Lounge
Contrary to popular belief, I don’t go out to a 
new bar every weekend. But lucky for you guys, 
I’ve been to enough bars in Pittsburgh that I could 
write this every week for a year and never leave 
my home.
So let’s reach back into my archives of nights out 
and talk about Tiki Lounge in Southside. I went to 
this exciting, tiki-themed bar on Halloween and it 
was certainly a night to remember.
The location: Tiki Lounge is located on E. Carson 
St. This place is a considerable distance outside 
of the Oakland, Squirrel Hill, Shadyside bubble. 
I hope you’re going with at least four friends 
because while the Lyft there may not cost more 
than $10, I guarantee you that the one you call 
at 2 a.m. when everything closes will come with 
skyrocketing surge prices. E. Carson St. quickly 
goes from a place to bar hop to a parade with no 
floats as everyone floods the streets figuring out 
what to do now that the bars are closed. Maybe 
this is just because I went on Halloweekend, but it 
was absolutely packed and it took forever to get a 
Lyft. 
This outside post-party can still have some 
excitement though. I met quite a few characters out 
there including a guy who asked if he could marry 
me and take me to Australia. I politely declined.
The drinks: This is not the place to get drunk. 
They’ve got a vast menu of tasty and delicious-
sounding drinks. It’s worth it to order at least one, 
but at around $10 each that was about my limit 
before I had to switch back to mixed drinks. Their 
mixed drinks were fine but definitely on the pricier 
side. I would suggest not making this place your 
only stop for the night, you’ll find cheaper drinks 
somewhere else.
The vibe: The best way I can think to describe 
this place is an adult Rainforest Cafe. There was a 
waterfall in there. The front of the place has a bar 
and a few tables and the back has a dance floor. 
I’m not sure if this is a regular thing or if that was 
just the Halloween special, but it certainly made 
the place more exciting. With the bar area in the 
front and the club deeper in, it felt like the mullet 
of bars, business in the front and party in the 
back. It won’t be your go to place every weekend, 
but it was a good place to go for one weekend.
Lit or nah: This place teeters between being 
annoying and being super fun. It was Halloween 
so I was totally into the decor and over the top 
luau feel, but if it had been a normal weekend 
I can’t say if I would be. The lituation depends 
on how into cheesy bar themes you are. The 
litential is there, you just have to match this bar’s 
excitement.
For the people who like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain

---------------------------------------------------

People wanted a lot of things out of Justin Timberlake’s third appearance 
at the Super Bowl Halftime Show. They wanted Timberlake to reunite with 
NSYNC, a la his first appearance on the Super Bowl stage in 2001 where 
the boy band performed alongside Britney Spears, Aerosmith, Nelly, and 
Mary J. Blige. Some people wanted some sort of appearance from Janet 
Jackson, or #JusticeForJanet, after her infamous “wardrobe malfunction” 
in 2004 where Timberlake accidentally ripped off a piece of her costume 
during their duet of his song “Rock Your Body.” Since his album Man of 
the Woods dropped a few days before the performance, I was completely 
expecting him to perform at least two songs from the album besides 
“Filthy” as some sort of shameless (but later frowned upon) self-promotion. 
Instead, it seemed that what most people got during Timberlake’s Super 
Bowl Halftime Show was disappointment.
In short, the former NSYNC member’s performance was merely average. 
What Timberlake brought to the U.S. Bank Stadium was great and 
entertaining, but frankly didn’t feel new from the pop icon. For the most 
part, I felt like I was watching a Timberlake concert in Minneapolis, 
especially during the first half. While I have never been to one of 
his concerts (and am not sure if I plan to, since tickets start at $95), 
Timberlake’s smooth transitions between each of his familiar hits almost 
felt too perfect during the first half of his performance. After opening with 
“Filthy,” the divisive lead single off of Man of the Woods, Timberlake 
performed three of his hits “Rock Your Body,” “Senorita,” and “SexyBack” 
in such a fluid and effortless way that almost felt too rehearsed. The same 
applied for his next three songs, “My Love,” “Cry Me A River,” and 
“Suit & Tie,” thus only supporting the feeling in my gut that maybe I was 
watching some polished yet monotonously entertaining robot on screen. 
However, some of these statements can still be interpreted as compliments; 
the first half of Timberlake’s Super Bowl Halftime Show only served to 
solidify his overwhelming talent and to remind people of his relevance 
in the mainstream realm of pop music. At the start, Timberlake was 
effortlessly suave and entertaining.
The second half of Timberlake’s performance was when things became 
a little more interesting, in a variety of senses. After performing “Until 
the End of Time,” a seemingly forgotten ballad from his many singles, 
Timberlake transitioned into a cover of Prince’s “I Would Die 4 U,” making 
the Minneapolis crowd go crazy with excitement. However, Timberlake’s 
performance alongside a video projection of the Minneapolis-born 
icon was met with division and controversy over the fact that the video 
projection was almost a hologram of the late artist, who died April 21, 
2016. Additionally, Timberlake’s whole tribute faced controversy, with 
reasons varying from how Prince never wanted anyone to “do a hologram 
of me” to how Timberlake and Prince’s feud from the previous decade 
caused disapproval among fans of Prince. While the segment felt a little 
dated giving that he died over a year ago, and felt a little bit extra after 
Timberlake decided to light not only the whole stadium but the entirety of 
Minneapolis in purple, I did see how Timberlake wanted to respect Prince 
and his legacy on music through his cover. For the most part, it seems 
that this controversy will fall along quieter but similar lines of Jackson’s 
“wardrobe malfunction,” where the truth behind the performance seemed 
to be shrouded in mystery.
It is notable that in their more recent halftime shows, the Super Bowl 
features artists that had big breaks or comebacks five years ago in 
an effort to make their show “safe” (to avoid any further wardrobe 
malfunctions) and to cater to the larger crowd. To supplement that fact, it 
was only after I marinated on my previous robotic gut feeling for a few 
days that I looked back and found out that the choreography for some 
of his musical numbers, most notably “SexyBack,” was almost the exact 
same as his choreography for his 2013 performance at the MTV Video 
Music Awards, which was generally more entertaining and fulfilling. It is 
probably this detail and his lyric “No disrespect, I don’t mean no harm” 
from “Rock Your Body” that best sums up his Super Bowl performance: that 
for the most part, Timberlake wanted to not stir a larger pot so he wanted 
to emphasize his previous works and his huge talent. Unfortunately, he 
ended up doing so anyway.
If you liked Man of the Woods and you’re looking for Timberlake’s return 
to the realm of pop music in an overtly grandeur fashion, Timberlake’s 
Super Bowl LII Halftime Show will satisfy your needs. But if you want to 
watch a better version of the show that’s free of controversy and division, 
and you just really wanted that 
second NSYNC reunion, 
then watch his VMAs 
performance.

SUPERBOWL LII 

---------------------------------------------------

At 37, Justin Timberlake has decidedly transitioned into the fourth phase of his 
career. In the first, he was the star of a boy band that released three block-
buster albums. In the second, he established himself as a bonafide popstar, 
paving the way for any former boy band member to solo success. In the third, 
he focused on acting and being immature with Jimmy Fallon, punctuated with a 
two-part album in 2013, The 20/20 Experience.
And now, in the fourth, Timberlake is the superstar who remains essential to the 
music industry even when he’s not making music. He has settled into marriage 
and fatherhood, with no need or desire to do what anyone else is doing, or to 
do something novel. That could not be more clear on his new album, Man of 
the Woods.
After a rootsy album commercial that turned out to be more of a red herring 
than a preview, the album is a retread of old ideas and an attempt to use 
those old ideas to create something new. Working with familiar collaborators, 
Timbaland, The Neptunes, and Danja, Timberlake dabbles in a plethora of 
styles genres, from the familiar soul and R&B that blends with strains of funk, 
folk, and country. The production is slick and polished, sometimes too much so 
that Timberlake often recedes into the background of his songs, no longer the 
star or the main attraction.
On lead single “Filthy,” the robo-funk beats and layered vocal effects drown 
out Timberlake’s voice, which doesn’t have much to say in the first place. 
“Midnight Summer Jam” is filled with throwaway platitudes about having fun 
in the South and the far more interesting combination of violin, guitar, and 
harmonica, but overstays its welcome, reminiscent of The 20/20 Experience’s 
bloated track times.
“Sauce” and “Wave” both are let down by hollow lyrics like “I love your pink, 
you like my purple” and “I got a couple fish then we can dine,” while the for-
mer is saved by a catchy melody and blaring electric guitar and the latter is a 
complete misstep with no hook to speak of.
Man of the Woods hits its stride with the title track, with Timberlake being both 
effortlessly cool and convincingly earnest. The soft percussion hip-hop beat 
allows his voice to shine, both in his lower register and in falsetto.
Both collaborations on the album, with Alicia Keys and Chris Stapleton on “Morning Light” and “Say Something” respectively, are standouts. On “Morning Light,” 
we find Timberlake at his most intimate, singing of long-term love with Keys. The old-school soul and the slow, saccharine melody do their job, imposing images of 
lazy Sunday mornings in bed. The song also has my favorite line on the album, the cheesy but honest “In the whole wide world of guys/I must be the luckiest alive.”
Stapleton is an expected guest, after his and Timberlake’s show stopping performance at the 2015 CMA Awards, which started talk of Timberlake’s possible shift to 
country. “Say Something” will get play on both pop and radio, and is one of the best songs on the album. The acoustic guitars and electronic beats are an interest-
ing mix that makes the song simultaneously rustic and modern.
The album ends strong, with “The Hard Stuff,” co-penned by Stapleton; and “Young Man,” featuring Timberlake’s wife and son. “The Hard Stuff” continues the 
theme of marriage that permeates throughout the album. It’s soft and mellow, and benefits from being the shortest track on the album at 3:15. “Young Man” ties the 
album together, a sentimental declaration of love for his son. Timberlake’s first album since his son’s birth, the title of Man of the Woods is derived from his name, 
Silas, which means “of the forest.” Unlike many of the songs on the album, “Young Man” has something definite to say.
Man of the Woods is an intriguing mess by a musician known for his slick, assured style. By forgoing a specific genre and borrowing from many influences from the 
past, Timberlake isn’t interested in creating and shaping the pop music of 2018. And in the end, that’s okay.

It has been a year of breakout stars and indie movie success, and 
the coming-of-age romance, Call Me By Your Name boasts both. 
Based on the novel by André Aciman, the film takes place in 1980’s 
rural Italy and follows Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a precocious 
teen spending his summer in the countryside, and Oliver (Armie 
Hammer), a graduate student working for Elio’s father. Over the 
course of a sun-soaked summer, the characters navigate unexpected 
stirrings of hesitant romance that bloom into true connection.
Now, this isn’t the kind of gay love story we’re used to; the love 
interests are not threatened by physical violence, social realities, 
or cruel outsiders. Instead, their relationship is threatened by the 
kind of struggles that impede all forms of intimacy: insecurity, 
inexperience, guilt, fear, and the impending end of summer. Some 
viewers have criticized the film for its lack of any real conflict, 
arguing the film is devoid of any realistic fallout or complication. 
And while that may be true, I can’t say I minded.
From Elio’s encouraging father, to Marzia, his supposed girlfriend, 
the film’s characters are incredibly gentle and ultimately accepting of 
Elio’s journey. Each relationship, be it familial, friendly, or romantic, 
is so carefully crafted that you find yourself equally as invested in the 
father’s bittersweet support, and Marzia’s innocent hopefulness as 
you do the consuming passion between Elio and Oliver. And while 
Elio and Oliver’s relationship is sexual, it’s not necessarily sexy. Their 
love scenes and even daily interactions are awkward and cautious 
in a refreshing and endearing way that speaks to Elio’s age and 
character.

---------------------------------------------------

The authenticity of Elio and Oliver’s relationship is due in large part 
to the film’s screenplay, which incorporates key moments from the 
book (including the famous, “call me by your name and I’ll call you 
by mine” line) and gives additional access to Oliver’s character that 
you won’t find in the original novel. But, the relationship would go 
nowhere without the sense of time and place established through 
the setting itself (and Armie Hammer’s wardrobe). As the men 
romp, bike, and swim through forests, fields, and streams, it seems 
there’s no better place to fall in love than rural Italy. The film’s 
saturated colors, delicate lighting, and lush Italian scenery leave you 
yearning for summer and a romance of your own.
Any commentary on the film would be incomplete without 
acknowledgement of the impeccable soundtrack. The film’s mix of 
classical compositions, Italian ‘80s pop hits, and original pieces by 
Sufjan Stevens is reason enough to watch this film. Stevens wrote 
two original tracks for the movie, one of which, “Mystery of Love,” 
is up for “Best Original Song” at this year’s Academy Awards. And 
that’s not the only potential win for Call Me By Your Name; the film 
is also nominated for “Best Picture,” “Best Adapted Screenplay,” and 
newcomer Timothée Chalamet is nominated for “Best Actor” for his 
portrayal of Elio.
With the Oscar’s quickly approaching, it’s difficult to know where to 
start in terms of what films to see and what hype to listen to, but I 
can guarantee the praise surrounding Call Me By Your Name is to 
be believed. Simply put, it’s beautiful.

Probably the most impressive 
thing about Steven Spielberg’s 
new movie The Post is just how 
quickly it was made. The film 
opened on Jan. 12, just nine 
months after Spielberg first 
read the script and decided that 
making this movie, and making it 
fast, was a must. Taking just over 
two months to film, Spielberg 
zipped through the first edit in 
only three weeks before sending 
it over to long-time collaborator 
and composer John Williams. 
According to a Washington 
Post story by Stephanie Merry, 
Spielberg’s efficiency and 
determination was key: he would 
even use his spare hours on set to 
go back and cut down scenes he

Why was Spielberg in such a rush 
to bring The Post to theaters? The 
answer lies in the film’s timely 
subject matter: The Washington 
Post’s attempts to publish The 
Pentagon Papers in 1971. The 
documents were a classified 
government study that detailed 
how several American presidents 
had lied to both the people of 
the United States and Congress 
regarding the U.S.’s 30-year 
involvement in the Vietnam War. 
Part of the papers were at first 
partially leaked by The New 
York Times, prompting President 
Richard Nixon to order the 
newspaper to stop production 
through a federal court 
injunction. The Times appealed, 
leading to a Supreme Court case. 
While this battle raged on, The 
Washington Post started printing 
their own stories based on 
portions of the documents they 
had obtained. Once again, the 
government tried to thwart the 
free press, and The Washington 
Post was added to The Times’ 
Supreme Court case. While the 
newspapers would eventually 
triumph — the Supreme Court 
ruled 6-3 in their favor —
the way the movie highlights 
the attempts of the Nixon 
administration to limit the 
freedom of the press feels 
particularly relevant in light of the 
Trump administration’s dealings 
with the media.
Along with a highly important 
and pertinent theme, The Post 
features an all-star cast. The 
film is led by veterans Meryl 
Streep, who plays Washington 
Post publisher Kay Graham, and 
Tom Hanks, who plays executive 
editor Ben Bradlee, and each 
delivers an unsurprisingly stellar 
performance. Streep’s best scene 
comes when Graham confronts 
her long-time friend Secretary 
of Defense Robert McNamara, 
who had commissioned the 
report. The tension in the scene is 
palpable and Streep’s delivery is 
convincingly intense as Graham 
berates McNamara for sending 
the children of his friends to a 
war he knew they could not win.
The rest of the cast, while not as 
famous in name alone, are all 
talented actors who have shone in 
some of the best television shows 
of the past ten years. Tracy Letts 
from Homeland, Alison Brie from 
Community, Zach Woods from The 
Office and Silicon Valley, Matthew 
Rhys from The Americans, Sarah 8

Paulson from American Horror 
Story, Bob Odenkirk and Jesse 
Plemons from Breaking Bad and 
Fargo, Carrie Coon, also from 
Fargo, and Michael Stuhlbarg, 
who appeared in Fargo too, as 
well as numerous movies such as 
A Serious Man, Shape of Water, 
and Call Me By Your Name, all 
have supporting roles. If anything, 
the movie is worth seeing for the 
acting talent alone.
At times, the movie falters. The 
message can be heavy-handed, 
with the screenplay even throwing 
around the word “collusion,” 
which has been all over the news 
concerning Trump’s involvement 
with Russia. Some scenes feel 
a bit slow, and in others the 
drama can feel forced — during 
some of the big speeches, the 
dialogue can feel slightly corny, 
and the swelling of the music and 
Spielberg’s circling shots add to 
the tackiness.
Nonetheless, The Post is a 
outstanding film. Bolstered by 
a superb cast and an impactful 
story, The Post delivers a crucial 
reminder that the freedom of 
the press is the First Amendment 
of the U.S. Constitution and 
solidifies why it needs to stay that 
way.

L
ast Tuesday, Carnegie Mellon was visited 
by filmmaker, entrepreneur, and YouTube 
star Casey Neistat. Neistat, best known 
for his multimedia company Beme and 
his inventive style of vlogging, provided some 
choice advice to Carnegie Mellon’s aspiring 
filmmakers:
“Nobody knows 
anything.”
Coming from an accomplished filmmaker who 
presumably knows a lot about his work, this 
advice was unexpected. A few laughs came 
from the audience, who thought his advice was 
just a joke, but Neistat was as serious as could 
be. As he told his life story though a series of 
jokes interspersed with videos from his career, 
Neistat related how utterly unpredictable life 
can be, and how determination can take you 
from humble beginnings to national acclaim.
Neistat first entered into the job field as a dish 
washer in a small seafood restaurant in an even 
smaller town. He started creating videos as a 
way to share his feelings and have his voice 
be heard, hoping to impact others from his 
tiny community in Gales Ferry, Connecticut. He 
continued to make videos, eventually moving 
to New York City. Over the course of several 
years, he and his brother, Van Neistat, landed 
an HBO show The Neistat Brothers in 2010. 
Being in the company of shows like Boardwalk 
Empire and How to Make It in America, the 
show never gained quite the footing they had 
hoped for. Undeterred, Neistat kept his energy 
on filmmaking while simultaneously working as 
a bike messenger in New York. This is where 
he created the immensely popular “Bike Lanes” 
video. Currently at 20 million views, this video 
was the one that established him in the public 
eye. Neistat was just “angry about having 
to pay $50 for riding his bike outside of the 
bike lane, and decided to make a stupid video 
about it.” This “stupid video” in due time lead 
to a three-film collaboration with Nike, explod-
ing his career as a filmmaker both on YouTube 
and on the commercial scene. As he so point-
edly remarked during his lecture, “who could 
have foreseen that happening?”
It’s here where his advice — “Nobody knows 
anything” — comes into play. He tells students 
that he “had no idea what he was doing, 
but he was doing it anyways,” determinedly 
chasing after his goals and taking down any 
obstacle that stood in his way. “Big successes 
can come from unexpected places,” saying 
he could never have guessed that his “stupid 
video” about New York’s transportation laws 
would result in greater long-term success than 
an eight-episode HBO series. While life may be 
wildly unpredictable, “it can take you to places 
you’d never known.”
Like many of the others at the lecture, I found 
Neistat’s advice to be lighthearted, fun, and 
incredibly valuable. Entering into such an estab-
lished field, especially one in the entertainment 
industry, can be incredibly daunting; we’re sur-
rounded by others who’ve accomplished and 
experienced so much more than we have, and 
we can often find ourselves feeling like we truly 
don’t know anything. But that’s okay — appar-
ently, no one else does either! And as crazy as 
that can sound, it brings an important truth to 
mind: all that matters is our own determination 
and our own grit. While some opportunities 
can lead to other amazing ventures, and other 
opportunities may not, setting our sights on our 
goals and fighting for them can yield incredible 
results. Like Neistat, if we stick to our guns and 
focus our energy on our goals, we can have 
big successes in our own wildly unpredictable 
lives.
After warmly joking about his past experiences 
and videos, Neistat finished his lecture with 
one last piece of advice, and left the audience 
feeling motivated and energized:
“Do more, and do what 
you can’t.”
