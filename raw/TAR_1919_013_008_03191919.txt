IOLSHEVIKI CONQUERED IN EAS1 DORMITORY
vlodern Methods of Warfare Used to 
Overcome Reign of Terror and Noise
By Staff Correspondent with the Belligerents at the Front.(
A growing Bolsheviki element recently manifesting itself among the 
yearlings of the East and. ¡South Dormitories came to a head Wednesday 
night. The Freshmen having all their recitations memorized, assembled to 
the tune of sixty strong in the East Dormitory with purposes of evil intent. 
As their numbers were more than would fill one room, two room^ were 
utilized and preparations completed for destroying the gentle rule of the 
upper classes. Their plans for the annihilation of the governing board 
were enough to make Foch’s strategical drives look like pie eating contests.
During all these preparations the upper classmen had not been idle. As 
rin days of yore, President King dispatched a runner with a “Fiery Cross” 
With the result that from far and near the three upper clans assembled 
Iwithin the confines of the dormitory. They immediately advanced to the 
rendezvous of the Freshmen and demanded entrance. Admission was denied 
them, so the great leaders withdrew to consult on the method of siege.
Generalissimo Avery ordered forth the irresistible tanks, "Red” and 
"Fat,” but the barricaded door proved to be too formidable. They were with­
drawn and the light paddle artillery sent up. A fine drum fire was affected 
against the door and a few panels started. But being unable to cope with 
the situation the paddle artillery retired and momentarily the clans were 
nonplussed. Shouts of joy rent *tlie air as the Freshmen celebrated this 
partial triumph. However, President King and “Ace” Avery produced their 
trump card. A heretofore unknown instrument of dormitory warfare was 
brought into play. This new weapon was a pickaxe, and under the masterful 
guidance of Field Marshal Gare, the4------------------------------------------------------------------“ ” ““ ““ MAJOR H. W. HOLLAND

opening thus secured, another 
phase of warfare was tried. A liquid 
gas (H20) under great pressure, was 
forced into the room and sort of 
dampened the ardor of the defending 
forces. Undaunted by this sudden 
turn of affairs, they backed a couple 
of reinforced mattresses against the 
door and effectually stopped the flow 
of liquid refreshments. Neither side 
was undaunted. Again the heavy 
pickaxe artillery dropped a few shells 
and a crater was formed in the mat- 
Vtresses amidst the flying remains of 
mangled "cooties.” A barrage of 
liquid gas was again tried and the 
morale of the defenders was broken. 
They demanded an armistice.
Boarding a raft, “Major General” 
Hinch-Cliffe, O. D. S. U. V. W., sailed 
into the room and presented the terms 
of the armistice to the#defeg.ted Fresh­
men. iHe returned after the parley 
with the terms of unconditional sur­
render. Between two lines of the de­
termined upperclassmen, the . van­
quished were herded to the scene of 
the trial. The court convened and the 
governing board withdrew to consider 
the case. They quickly returned a ver­
dict of "guilty,” and after much mel- 
low-drama and "East Lynn” effect on 
the part of the protesting leaders, the 
peace terms were administered by the 
Upperclassmen. Twenty-one haircuts 
and one hundred and five blows of the 
paddle. Never before at Tech has the 
stillness of the night been, broken by 
such a wealth of well-directed blows.
Imagine, if you can, the carefree at­
titude of the executioner as he non­
chalantly cut the atmosphere with his 
swinging paddle. Much time was

INTERESTING EXHIBIT OF BRITISH WAR PAINTINGS
A collection of 241 war paintings 
and drawings by British artists is 
now on exhibition in the galleries of 
the Department of Fine Arts, Carne­
gie Institute. Every phase of war 
has been considered—the battlefields, 
the training of soldiers, the various 
branches of service, views in muni-i
tion factories and in shipyards. Not 
only the fronts in France and Fland- 
¡ers are depicted but the remote bat­
tle lines of Egypt and Palestine.
Major Sir William Orpen, who has 
the largest individual contribution, 
spent two years at the western front, 
with headquarters at Cassél. He has 
given us admirable portraits of Mar­
shal Foch, Field Marshal Sir Douglas 
Haig, and a dozen other officers of 
lesser fame. He has also painted 
scores of scenes and events in his 
(Continued on Page Three.)
Before introducing Major H. W. 
Holland, the regular speaker in last 
week’s general assembly, Dean Mott 
pointed out another side of Tech’s 
clean-up movement. The faculty are 
doing their best to make the campus 
look respectable and it is every stu­
dent’s duty to keep up his personal ap­
pearance. Those who wish to wear a 
uniform should do so in a way pre­
scribed by the service regulations. 
All should get into the spirit of this 
improvement mood.
Major Plolland, who is to be Tech’s 
Assistant Professor of Military Sci­
ence and Tactics, served in France 
with the Eleventh Engineers. In his 
talk he gave an explanation of the 
work and duties of the Engineering 
Corps.
The principal topics in his discus­
sion were the building and operation 
of railroads behind the lines, the un­
loading of the first British tanks 
brought to France, and the obtaining 
of an adequate water supply. Ac­
cording to Major Holland, no matter 
what your peace-time occupation was, 
there was some place for you to fill in

MELLON HALL ANO ANNEX GAVE DANCE
March 14 Mellon Hall and Annex 
gave a very successful dance. This is 
the first dance the two houses have 
had together since they were united 
under one head. The affair was under 
the chairmanship of the following 
girls:
Programs—Helen Young.
Decorations—Helen Hewitt.
Refreshments—Janet Rutherford.
Music—Grace Butcher.
The music was furnished by Maggio 
and consisted of two pieces. As a 
new idea, and one that will please 
the Sophomores especially, the follow­
ing plan has been adopted: At every
social function that is given at Mellon 
Hall the Freshmen girls, under the 
supervision of Mary Little, will be ex­
pected to clear away the furniture, 
and see that the rooms are left in or­
der for the next day.

Design Costume Ball
The Event of your Life at 
Design
------DON’T MISS IT!
EVERYTHING READY FOR DESIGN’S BIG TIME
Witb ail plans for the Fete com­
plete, tfco Design School is awaiting 
with eagerness the great event. The 
committees have completed their 
work of arranging for every detail of 
the ball and no energy or expense 
has been spared to make it the great­
est event in the history of the school.
The materials for decorating and 
furnishing the school have arrived, so 
there will be no delay when the task 
of making ready for the ball begins. 
No greater enthusiasm has ever been 
manifested by the Design Students. 
Each one is taxing his ingenuity to 
the utmost in getting ready the cos­
tumes and designs. The greatest ac­
tivity is being shown by the Design 
Students, who are making wonderful 
Oriental panels to cover the walls. 
Artistry and science will be combined 
in the decorating and lighting of tihe 
building. The committees on lighting 
are jealously guarding their ideas. In 
response to inquiriers about the light­
ing the chairman of * the committee 
went no further than to state that the 
lighting will be more varied, unique 
and artistic than any which has ever 
been seen. _
The costumes themselves will be a 
feast for the eyes. Although every 
.costume will be Oriental, there will 
be no two alike. They will form a 
fantastic, vivid, dazzling ensembl'e, 
which will be further enhanced by the 
beautiful Oriental background. The 
walls will be paneled with Oriental 
dragons and fetishes and the entire 
school will be a veritable Oriental 
paradise.
The guests will arrive in costume, 
and will not unmask until midnight. 
At this time a feast will be served in 
the Exhibition Room, which will be 
Far-Eastern in every detail. During 
the course of the ball a program of 
entertainment will be provided by all 
the talent of the school.
The details of this entertainment 
will be announced later.
TOO BAD !WE COULDN’T SEE
It was generally agreed by the large 
audience that witnessed the Junior 
Stunt in the Recreation Hall on 
Thursday last, that it came up to, if 
it did not surpass all expectations. 
Not oiily was the Stunt highly enter­
taining, but it was instructive as well, 
and proved a great credit to all de­
partments of the college. First of all 
came the Hawaiian Orchestra, whose 
members looked very striking, and 
whose musical genius must have fur­
nished real inspiration to the ac­
tresses. After they had played a se­
lection or two, came the athletes, who 
performed miracles of strength and 
grace. That’s what physical training 
does for girls at Margaret Morrison! 
The next act, executed by the girls of 
all sizes, upon vehicles of all sizes, 
was also a tangible example of the 
benefits of athletics, as was, too, the 
Hula Dance by Mary Louise Me- 
Caughey, which must have been au­
thentic, as Miss McCaughey has spent 
a considerable time in Hawaii, where, 
if we are to accredit the songs, little 
else but Hula dancing is done. The 
third act, and Grand Finale, was 
placed 20 years hence, and in Child’s, 
arid one actress vied with another in 
the number of laughs won from the 
audience. Miss Glen Sheriff, as a 
¦gum-chewing waitress, deserves par­
ticular mention, for her clever make­
up, speeches and acting. Also, par­
ticularly funny were the representa­
tives of the Dietetics Department, but 
to enupierate all the successes would 
be to enumerate all t'he actresses. The 
Stunt closed with the singing of cer­
tain ballad-classics, composed by the 
Junior Class.
The chairman of the Stunt Com­
mittee ¡was Miss Barbara Endres, who 
certainly did a lot of work, and did it 
well. Assisting her on the committee 
were Miss Mary Bechtel, Miss Irma 
Friedman and Miss Glenn Sheriff. 
But it wasn’t only the committee, 
everyone pitched in and helped, and 
had a good time helping.
A REVIEW OF THEBASKET Mil SEASON
Season Short But Quite Successful as a 
Whole
LET’S GO,’22
THE CARNEGIE CRAB
“I was conceived and born in passion, prejudice and' despair. I was 
born against my will into a world of unnumbered sins. The desires and 
accomplishments of my fellow students irritate me. The world is wrong. 
I am prejudiced against any and all things my college does. I believe 
the administration is wrong. The faculty is ignorant, and the variegated’ 
multitude of students are laboring under the accumulated mistakes of 
generations.
“I am shunned by all. My fellow students despise me. The faculty dis­
likes me—they, too, know that I can see they are wrong. Who am 1? Don’t 
you know, I am the Carnegie Crab.”
Thank God there are but few at Tech and they should be tarred anti 
feathered, and driven forever from the cariipus. They think themselves wise 
but they are foolish. They are cultivating a habit from which they can 
never break away. Their people will dislike them. They are filling their 
life with misery and discontent. They are losing their self respect and the 
confidence of their fellow students. They seem to enjoy life only that they 
may point out the faults of others. It may serve as a pastime while hero 
alive, but dying they will curse their natal day.
Be considerate—be moderate. Remember eighty per cent of all adverse! 
criticism is ignorance and the work of less intelligent minds. Above all 
when criticism ;is offered be sure that it is not about something the criticiser 
could not do himself.
If one's racial characteristics make him noisy and illmannei*ed curb them. 
If one religion differs from some one’s else then be polite and KEEP IT 
STILL.
Be a Booster—Not a Knocker.— (Editor.)
EX-PRES. TAFT PLEASED BY TECH MUSICAL CLUDS
A hint to the wise is ¡Sufficient. * 
•> Science Freshmen, watch your ?
* step when passing through the *
* School o£ Applied Industries. v
On Friday afternoon, March 7, the 
clubs departed for the first long trip 
of the season. The special car which 
the clubs chartered from thfe Pehn- 
sylvania Railroad was noisy at all 
times, as many different practice ses­
sions were conducted. On the arrival 
in latrobe the men were greeted by 
the Senior class of Latrobe High 
Schbol and entertained for dinner.
The concert was, without a doubt, 
one of the best ever produced. In spite 
of the* fact that the clubs have, had 
only five weeks’ practice, the concert 
went off like clockwork. Mr. Miller, 
principal of the school says of it: "It 
is the best concert that I have ever 
heard a college organization give.”
The stage setting deserves special 
mention. The large plaid and white 
banner was in the background, and 
the chairs were covered with white 
and a large plaid C. Floral decora­
tions were on the sides of the stage.
After the concert the High School 
Athletic Association gave a dance for 
the clubs in the town hall.
The following afternoon the Glee 
Club sang for Ex-President Taft. Mr. 
Taft was in Latrobe in behalf of the 
League of Nations. Mr. Taft was 
much pleased with the numbers of the 
Glee Club and the club was honored 
to perform for such a notable char­
acter.
The clubs arrived in Greensburg

SHARD MEETS
The 1919 Thistle Board has com­
menced work on the publication of 
the Tech’s Year Book for this school 
year. The board met twice within 
the last two weeks, and the work 
has been outlined and divided 
amongst the various editors. The 
Editor-in-Chief is Gilbert C. Clark, 
Junior Commercial, and the Asso 
ciate Editor-in-Chief is Miss Edith D. 
Braden,' Junior in the Margaret Mor­
rison School. At the first meeting 
of the board W. H. Oakley, Upper 
Industries, was elected to the posi­
tion of business manager, and W. C. 
Seabright, Science Junior, was ap­
pointed sales manager. Miss Jean­
nette C. Shirk and Robert Schmertz 
are the art editors having been ap­
pointed by the Faculty of the Paint­
ing and Decorating Department of 
Design School. The other editors of 
the board representing the Junior 
classes’ representatives are Miss
and Miss Frances Roberts from Mar­
garet Morrison School, Jasues F.
Giffen and W. K. Fawcett from Sci­
ence, Alexander L. Buchanan and 
James S. Church from' Design, and 
James Batman and John H. Moore 
from Industries. The Sophomore
classes representatives are Miss
Margaret Bowman, M. M. C. S., Al­
bert C. May of Science, Luther S. 
Lashmit of Design, and Robert W. 
Seidel of Industries.

Tech ended their basket ball season with a regular display of the- old 
Tech “pep.” Although we lost to Pitt by a score of 34-26, every o.ne who 
saw the game was very much satisfied with the outcome. Ever since
"Gretz,” captain and star center of the Plaid, was injured in the Penn-
State game, the scoring machine which was doing such good work earlier 
in the season, was broken up. Foxoii, who took Gretzler’s place in the 
Pitt game, played a splendid brand of basket ball and aided greatly in the 
formidable fight which the Tech tosser put up against the Blue and Gold. 
Much credit is due to Coach Bert Bianchi, the former Allegheny star, and 
to Hans Wagner, who instilled the fighting spirit into the team.
Hamman leads the squad in field goals with 37 to his credit, Abrams fol­
lowing with 29; Lynn has a total of 27, while he can show but 22, due to 
his missing a number of games because of injuries.
-------------------------------------------------------------a—? An interesting fact of the summary
shows that Abrams scored in every
game, while Hamman and Lynn scored 
in every game but one. Abrams did 
most of the foul shooting throughout 
the season, but did not equal liis rec­
ord of former years. The summary 
shows that he netted 147 out of a pos­
sible 234 chances, an average of .628.
Tech should have a great team next 
year, as Capt. Gretzler is the only man 
of this year’s team to graduato. Man­
ager Stupakoff announces. that be­
sides Nlchol, Good, Leet and Maurer, 
the varsity substitutes, excellent ma­
terial will be furnished by this year’s 
Freshman squad. It is also reported 
that Nig Flnloy, captain-elect of the 
1917 team, is coming back noxt sea­
son. Candidates for managership of 
next year’s team aro M. F. Yollo, of 
this city; W. J. Holler, of Jackson, 
Mich.; H. C. Henderson, of Groens- 
burg, and McMahon, of Oil City.
A banquet for this year’s team will 
be hold just as soon as Grotzlor Is alilo 
to attend, and at that time next yoar’s 
captain will be elected.
The following will rocolvo their 
"C”: Gretzler, Abrams, Carey, Lynn, 
Hamman. and Manager Stupakoff.

"What makes that group of Sophs 
stare so and why do they look so wor­
ried?” a Senior was overheard asking 
a classmate as they traversed the 
fabled "cinder path.”
“It must be some dreadful catas­
trophe, for they look pretty worried,” 
was the only answer the other could 
makev
And it was, for as he spoke, there 
emerged from in back of Science 
building a long stream of blue hats 
and white overalls, here and there 
dotted with specks of black-or khaki,
with lovid yells of “nine-------teen-------
twenty-two,” as tlifc line proceeded 
proudly up the board walk. For the 
Plebes were out, out to show the 
Sophs some real, genuine "Pep.” The 
Sophs took the part of students very 
well, not daring to intorfere with 
their cheerful Instructors.
However, there were a few unruly 
ones, for some kind of an architect at­
tempted to drown some design maid­
ens by dropping a bucket of water 
from a top story Design window. 
Also some innocent Industry middle­
men tried to suppress the overflow of 
pep, but it was lucky that ho had boon 
born with some sense, for certain of 
the Freshmen were only too willing 
to give him a free ride on a rail.
It is not to be doubted that, every­
body, with the exception of a few ob­
stinate Sophs, thoroughly enjoyed the 
display, Including several M. M.’s and 
a number of Design damsels, especial­
ly two who quite enjoyed a "quiet” 
hour with two naval officers on a 
bench in the hall. Also the Oakland 
inhabitants quite approved; and Pitt— 
well, It certainly must have been a 
treat for them! Schenley High en­
joyed an enthusiastic game of "push­
ball,” as a shredded wheat box went 
bouncing around in the air. Finally, 
the proud procession wound its way

DOUGHNUTS-YES, AND MORE DOUGHNUTS
Don’t mention that word to an M. 
M. girl for many days to come, for 
they say they have seen enough 
doughnuts to last them the rest of 
their lives. The Household Econom­
ics Department made over 18,000 
doughnuts for the Salvation Army 
Drive on Saturday, using the same 
recipe that the S. A. Lassies used in 
France. The Costume Economics 
Department has been equally busy 
making 300 Salvation Army bonnets 
for the workers to wear.
On Saturday members of the Sopho­
more Class, wearing these beautiful 
Margaret Morrison bonnets were seen 
at the Margaret Morrison booths in 
the down-town district, giving out 
scientific M. M. made doughnuts to 
the subscribers to the fund.
If the Friends' League of the Salva­
tion Army exceeds the quota they 
have decided upon, it may be due to 
the loyal work of those M. M. C. C. 
girls, who made those M. M. C. C. 
doughnuts, hole and all.

SCIENCE TO HOLDINTER-CLASS MEET
Science School will hold an inter- 
class meet on Friday, April 18. This 
meet Is to bo the substitute for the 
annual Inter-school meet, which will 
not be held because there are not 
enough track men from the other 
schools to compete. Tlio inter-class 
meet will be between the Freshmen, 
Sophomore, Junior and Senior classes. 
Any man from Science School is 
eligible to enter, but men on the track 
squad will be handicapped. This ought 
to be a real meet, as quite a bit of 
class rivalry exists at present. The 
classes are pretty evenly matched as 
regards material, so get ready for one 
of the best school meets ever held.
The events are:
100 and 200 yard dashes 
300 and 600 yard runs 
1 and 2 mile runs 
Mile relay
High and low hurdles 
High jump 
Broad jump 
Pole vault

Miss Belleville was one of the most 
active faculty members Margaret Mor­
rison ever had. ¿he fostered school 
spirit and was instigator of many 
Plebe stunt parties and the like. She 
had a jolly way of getting into girls’ 
hearts and winning them over. Her 
Bible Circle was the real germ of our

something Tech will never lose.

PROFESSORS OF TECH AND PITT ENTERTAINED
A CLEAN UP DAY
Tech needs a clean up, day. The four school council has taken the matter 
up. If II. is successful all the accumulated “junk” in Tech's “no man’s 
land” west of M. M. C. C. building, will be removed. The brick and rubbish 
in front of Machinery Hall will be disposed of and'a few loads of the debris 
in front of Science, likewise.
The Senior Mechanicals last year, Ihreatened^to shove th6 incinerator 
in front of Machinery Hall, over the bank into the hollow. That loo, would 
have helped the appearance of the campus. If everybody demands a clean 
campus we will be able to keep one. It is your campus. Do your part.
MUD SLINGING
The last two years the two under classes have indulged too much in the 
art of painting. The walks and walls have been smeared and marked up with 
20, 21 and 22. Class spirit is a magnificent thing, but it seems that to 
mark up the walks; and walls of the campus with paint is a little too 
childish for collego hoys to indulge in. Paint can not,, be removed and It 
only distracts from whatever beauty the campus might have. Freshmen, 
Bet a precedent. Respect the property of the school.
A meeting of exceptional interest 
was held March 14, at the Oakland 
Community House, when a group of 
the outstanding professors represent­
ing the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology and the Univerfflftjr of Pitts­
burgh were entertained by the Direc­
tors of the Community House at din­
ner.
The object of the meeting was to 
set forth a plan for the formation of 
a Professors' Club, similar to the Vag­
abond Club of Chicago, which will of­
fer an opportunity for free and un­
trammeled discussion of intellectual 
problems of religion.
The activities of the club will be 
Under the direction of Prof. Lincoln 
It. Gibbs, head of the English Depart­
ment of the University of Pittsburgh. 
Other profesBors interested are: Prof. 
Gilbert Barnes, Carnegie Tech; Prof. 
Leonard P. Fox, Carnegie Tech; Prof. 
John Valente, University of Pitts­
burgh; Prof. Edwin B. Burgman, Uni- 
veristy of Pittsburgh; Prof. Homer 
Webster, University of Pittsburgh: 
Prof. R. W. Bolton, Carnegie Tech; 
Prof. T. Bayard Beatty, Carnegie 
Tech."
An entertainment following the sup­
per was furnished by the Girls' Glee 
Club of the University of Pittsburgh.
It is a great privilege of those who 
attend the Sunday Afternoon Social 
Suppers to hear such professors as 
these discuss those things of current 
interest. On Sunday, March 23, Prof. 
John Mecklin, head of the Department 
of Philosophy of the University of 
Pittsburgh, will give a talk on “The 
Lazy-Minded Christian.”
Supper is served at G o’clock at a 
charge of fifteen cents, which is fol 
lowed by a short address. You are 
invited to come.
GOING STRONG
In spite of the difficulties of a short year, Tech is going strong. The 
past basket bull season was quite successful. A good schedule was ar­
ranged and the management arid team ought to be congratulated for the 
way things came along.
Also the Thistle, the Tech annual and recorder of Tech College life is 
going to bo issued again Ibis year and the editor believes that a book can 
bo put out that will reflect every phase of college life. If you have any 
snap shots, jokes or poems, put them In the Thistle box.

good, and cries very little, but some­
how this serves only to make Dad ap­
prehensive, fearing the boy is saving 
up for future nights. In connection with 
this, the father begs the kind fore- 
beurance of his 8:30 classes in the fu­
ture, and should the midnight vigils 
with his pugilistic offspring make him 
often tardy, beseeches the students to 
forget that five-minute rule and wait 
for him.
At present writing, youth lacks 
definite cognomen, but Dr. Watkins

(this child being the first).
Who says our faculty has no pop?
If you bad boon to the Y. W. C. A. 
mooting on Thursday, you'd have 
hoard they believe In boosting every 
1)11, us much us the “studs," Their 
Freshmen I nice no back seat when 
asked to express themselves about 
school spirit, and they agree tluit a 
little more "gel'-togetlierlng" between 
faculty and students at M. M. ('. S. 
would limber up (he school a great 
deal. Miss Holmes led the meeting.
The "Stringers” again furnished de­
lightful music, u,nd very beautiful nnd 
appropriate songs bud been chosen by 
Miss Florence Bechtel. Miss Webster 
and Miss Sandels, both in their first 
year at Tech, expressed themselves 
freely us to their impressions of the 
school—not a whit less freely than 
the Freshmen have been doing in the 
meetings of the lust two weeks. Miss 
Webster suggested having four parties 
a year, having girls divided alphabet­
ically into four groups to furnish the 
fun. This would mix up the depart­
ments and broaden our interests and 
sympathies. Miss Sandels advised 
more curiosity on the part of the girls 
to test the instructors’ wit—rather 
dangerous advice to give to women, 
some may think.
Miss Breed gave a very beautiful 
talk about College Unrest and Break- j . ____ _
ing Away From Old Faiths and Reli MARIE E BELLEVILI Fgious Viewpoints. She likened our re-!1TIIUU «IfUUL. L. ULLLL f 1LLL 
ligious differences as different trim­
mings on a similar structure. As in a 
building, the steel framework is the 
part that holds up the Avails and 
floors, so religion forms the support of 
our lives, and our different phases of 
it are only like different finishes or 
trimmings on tho outside.

M. WANT TO ADOPT DR. WATKIN’S NEW SUN
1I)r. Watkins, head of tho Science 
Department at M. M. C. S., is now tho 
father of un infaht who was born— 
but let the youthful reporter speak.
She said it was a most encouraging 
interview. For instead of having to 
corner her quarry, he boldly came to 
her* and was eloquent beyond any re­
porter’s wildest dreams. He dotes on 
talking, she says, and with such a sub 
ject, who can blame him?
Miss Marie Elizabeth Belleville, 
aged 30, daughter of Joseph M. Belle­
ville, of the Bellefield Dwellings, died 
suddenly at. Shanghai, China, where 
she was attending a conference of the 
Y. W. C. A. Miss Belleville was born 
in Wheeling, W. Va., and was grad­
uated from Bryn Mawr in 1909, with 
the degree of A. B. She taught for 
some time in tho schools of Provi­
dence, R. I., and in Cleveland, and for 
four years in the Margaret Morrison 
School here, and also was engaged in 
summer playground work in Pitts­
burgh. She went to New York and 
became associated with tho Y. W. C. 
A., to prepare herself for service in 
foreign fields. She learned tho Chi­
nese language, and in Aug., 1917, went 
to Peking, China, as a Y. W. C. A, 
secretary. Later she was assigned to 
Canton, Chiua, where she was sta 
tioned prior to leaving for Shanghai 
Miss Belleville was a member of the 
East Liberty Presbyterian Church. 
Besides her father, she leaves two 
brothers, William M. Belleville, of 
Pittsburgh, and Norman W. Belle-
Major F. F. McIntosh, former as-1 
sociate Professor of Metallurgy at the ' •«
Carnegie Institute of Technology, will j I* 
deliver a lecture on the “Manufacture. v 
of Steel for Ordnance Materials in 
England and France” at the regular ' *X"X*»X~X**X»< 
monthly meeting of the Engineers’
Society of Western Pennsylvania,
Union Arcade Building, Tuesday,
March 18, at 8 p. m. This lecture will 
be illustrated with lantern slides, 
which will depict the inspection and 
manufacture of ordnance materials 
overseas. Major McIntosh was the 
Associate Chief Metallurgist, Techni­
cal Staff Ordnance Department, Wash­
ington, D. C., and was sent to England 
and France as a liaison officer from 
the Inspection Division of the Ord­
nance Department in Washington.
The purpose of his trip was to study 
the methods of inspection and manu­
facture, of ordnance materials in those 
countries, and the lecture which he is 
to deliver before the Engineers’ So­
ciety next Tuesday will be a summary 
of his impressions and observations.
Major C. B. Stanton, formerly Pro­
fessor of Civil Engineering at the Car- i 
negie Institute of Technology, who 
has been with, the 15th Engineers in 
France for nearly two years, has just 
notified the Dean of the Science 
School at Tech that he has been ap­
pointed a Professor in the American 
University for American Soldiers at 
Beaune, France. Major Stanton was 
with his regiment at Bordeaux await­
ing orliers to board a transport and 
come home when he received the un­
expected order of reporting to this 
“Soldier University” as Professor of 
Civil Engineering. Major Stanton had 
just been promoted to this rank from 
a captain, and it is a great source of 
satisfaction to his friends in Pitts­
burgh that he received this new hondr.

A letter from Private Frederick 
McConnell, former student in (lie 
Drama Department, was received by 
President A. A. Hamerschlag. Mr.. 
McConnell went to Carnegie Tech in 
1911, having graduated from the law 
school of the University of Nebraska. 
He completed his course at Tech in 
1917, and did some excellent work in 
the plays under Mr. Stevens. 1-Ie was 
made Assistant Director of the Arts 
and Crafts Theater under Same Hume, 
in Detroit, Mich., in which capacity 
he was when drafted into the service. 
He served in the infantry; in his first 
engagement at Fismes he was talcen 
prisoner, and was not released until 
the singing of the armistice in No­
vember, 19IS. He was then trans­
ferred to the Medical Supply Depot.
Another dance for the Freshmen of 
“Margaret Morrison Division” will be 
given in the. Union on Saturday even­

All-star Keith vaudeville will be given 
twice each day next week, beginning 
Monday afternoon, March 24, in the 
Davis Theater. Not one of the nine 
acts but has headlined important pro­
grams. Harry Watson, Jr., however, 
is the particular luminary from the 
two-dollars-a-seat theaters ¦whom the 
program features. Mr. Watson will be. 
surrounded by a numerous company 
of assistants, including Joseph Her­
bert, Jr., Lee.Armstrong, Gladys Alex-' 
ander, and Margery Holst. He will! 
present two episodes from his per­
formances with Jack Nonvorth’s inti­
mate revue, “Odds and Ends.” In the 
first of these Mr. Watson will be seen 
in the role of “Young Kid, Battling 
Dugan,” the prize ring incident.

morning, March 24. The role |vill be 
that of a denizen of San Francisco’s

Most of the work, however, is be­
hind the lines. One regiment of En­
gineers in France did nothing but re­
pair locomotives. Another unit pre­
pared the maps and charts. Others 
built roads for the motor transport 
service. Quite a few regiments were, 
kept busy building docks and main­
taining them. The water supply was 
taken care of by the Engineers. The 
gas and flame service was part of the 
work of the Engineers before the 
chemical warfare division was organ­
ized. There is not a branch of en­
gineering in civil life that was not 
used in the war.
Major Holland told of some very 
quick thinking that had to be done 
occasionally, when a shell would come 
when it was least wanted and would 
mess things up fiercely.
This interesting talk was well re­
ceived by the men, due not only to the 
fact that Major Holland was talking 
from bis own experience, but also to 
the fact that in the near future he 
will figure prominently in the R. O. T.
C. planned for the students. He will 
have Charge of the Engineers' division 
of this organization.

Although much time has been lost 
due to the irregularities of this 
school year, the entire board is high­
ly optimistic in regards to the 
Thistle’s success. Clark is very en­
thusiastic and promises more orig­
inality and a variety of humor 
unequalled in past Thistles. The 
board plans to send the book to press 
by the fifteenth of May so that it 
can be ready for issue by the middle 
of June, which means that the stu­
dent body must co-operate with the 
staff in every way possible to make 
the Year Book a true expression of 
Tech life. Thistle contribution boxes 
have been placed in all of the 
schools and the board will gladly wel­
come any suggestions such as snap­
shots of school life, poems, cartoons, 
jokes, etc. Such contributions will 
put your ideas into the book and 
make it your book.

the Engineering Corps. He stated 
that it is to be regretted that the ma­
jority of the people do not know what 
the Engineers really did, and that all 
the people think is that the Engineers 
wield a pick and shovel and nothing 
else.
There is nothing in war-time en­
gineering that differs from peace­
time engineering, except in the condi­
tions under which the men wrork. In 
peace-time all the work is planned 
ahead, exact drawings and blue prints 
for every detail are made and all the 
materials are available. But in war­
time, most of the work is planned in 
very short periods of time, if planned 
at all; the materials are not of the 
hight kind, and almost always not at 
the right place. Where an engineer 
in civil life would use a number 
twelve tool, he has to content himself 
with two number sixes. Indeed, It is 
the ingenuity which an engineer uses 
in patching up the scanty materials 
and getting the desired job accom­
plished that determines the success of 
the army engineer.
In civil life an engineer could 
leisurely go on with his work with a 
sense of absolute security. Not so in 
the army work. The engineer there 
has one eye on his transit, and the 
other on the nearest dugout, ready to 
run at the first whiz of a bullet or roar 
of a cannon. This, of course, is true 
only for work directly behind the 
front lines.

I jUHt want to drop you a few linen 
and let you know that 1 am about to 
return with my regiment to the 
United State», and hope to renew ac­
quaintance with the old school and It« 
good people Borne time in April. In 
the almost two year« that I have been 
over here, the news of Tech that has 
come to mo has been mighty scant, 
and I am anxious to know the happen­
ings during the period.
I read In a British paper of the do­
nation of some of the famous Richard 
Mansfield stage properties to the 
Dramatic School, and also in the same 
paper of old Hans Wagner’s accept­
ance of the post of physical director 
at Tech. Both pleased me very much.
I have recently been made Lieut. 
Colonel of the regiment, and return to 
the States with the feeling that the 
fates have treated me kindly since I 
have been here. Not only do I feel 
this, on account of my promotions, 
but in every way. I have my health, 
am forward looking and, as Mr. 
Hughes would say, “I will enter my 
new work back In the States witli a 
zest.”
I trust all has gone happily with 
you and your family during the period. 
Please give my very best wishes to 
Mrs. Hamerschlag and the boys. With 
kindest regards to yourself, I am 
Most sincerely,
F. E. FOSTER, 
Lieut. Colonel, Engineers, 12th En­
gineers, U. S. Army.
FIELD ARTILLERY GROUP WILL BE FULLY EQUIPPED
Lieut. Col. Cole, head of the Field

stationed at Toch four American 3-In. 
field pieces with caissons, limbers,

We have the honor system in M. M.

schools as well. We know our ban-} 
ner would undoubtedly grace the wall 
of any house, but we are sure it 
would show to much greater advan­
tage in its proper place. Many hours 
of honest labor and toll went into the 
making of that banner, and will not 
the culprit who is depriving us of the 
fruits of our labor please repent and 
restore the lost banner to us, and so 
receive the M. M. C. Czi’s everlasting 
gratitude?

BASEBALL
' Coach Wagner issued a call for 
battery men last week and quite-a lot 
of candidates turned out for practice. 
Instructions were given the pitchers 
in throwing to bases with men on, and 
various other points were given by 
Coach Wagner. Practice is rather 
light until the weather warms up.
A general call was issued last Sat­
urday for all candidates. About 15 
men were on hand and a light workout 
was the program. Movies were taken 
of Coach Wagner teaching the candi­
dates how to use a bat properly and 
to swing properly. Tech should be 
represented by a Rood team this year, 
most of last year’s team being back 
on the job.
TRACK
Candidates for the track team have 
been jogging through the park and on 
the track for nearly two weeks, con 
ditioning themselves for the events of 
this season. All candidates have been 
using this means of ridding ¿heir 
lungs of the effects of “Camels” and 
"Lucky Strikes,” and Coach Wagner 
hopes to have the men in splendid 
condition very soon.
Several of the men entered the Alle­
gheny Mountain Indoor meet at Du- 
quesne Garden last Saturday for prac­
tice in their events. C. B. Schmidt, 
unattached, won second place In the 
600-yard dash, and G. C. Stone cap­
tured second place ih the one-mile 
walk. Coach Wagner would like to 
see a larger turnout for track.

Last Sunday afternoon the girls of 
Mellon Annex were guests at a Charm­
ing tea given by Mrs. Brown, chaperon 
of Mellon Aunex, in the large living 
room. Although it is only one of 
several lovely Sunday afternoon teas 
given by her, this one will be remem­
bered particularly, because of its 
significance, the day being Mrs. 
Brown’s birthday anniversary. The 
entertainment largel y centered 
around the birthday cake, which was 
lighted by candles and contained the 
fatal fayors—ring, button, thimble, 
heart, rider-on-horsebaclc and anchor, 
all sent direct from Ireland for this 
particular occasion. 1*116 girls ate 
their cake carefully, watching for a 
token, and rejoiced or mourned, as 
their fates wore revealed. Mrs. 
Brown then told the nearer future 
from the tea leaves In the empty tea 
cups. For thoso who did not get a 
token, another birthday tea. is prom­
ised on Mr. Brown’s birthday, even if 
his absence will be necessary, because 
of his duties as a chaplain in the 
British Army.

On Friday night last, a new event In 
Fraternity life took place. At that 
time representatives from almost 
every fraternity had gathered at the 
Woodlawn Club for a general “get-to­
gether” meeting and smoker.
The meeting was called to order by 
Mr. C. O. I-Ioban, acting chairman, and 
a little program followed. A solo was 
rendered by R. A. Moore, which was 
heartily received. This was followed 
by readings given by J. A. Farr and 
C. M. Blackburn, the former rendering 
one of Rob W. Service’s poems from 
the war, and the latter a rather sad 
poem with piano accompaniment, 
“That Old Sweetheart of Mine.” Fol­
lowing this, J. Honus Wagner, Sec. Dr. 
Baker, Dean Mott, Prof. H. S. Hower 
and Prof. B. C. Dennison gave short 
but interesting talks. Dean Mott com- 
'mended the men on initiating this new 
idea of getting the fraternities to­
gether to get acquainted with each 
other and to co-operate in promoting 
the interests of the school. Dr. Baker, 
although making his first appearance 
among Tech men, said that he was 
glad to have the opportunity of meet­
ing the men and also commended the 
men- on their pride in their school.
After a bout by Kid Rinehart and 
Speedy Rowe, and a slamming match 
by Gougler and Harlcness, the body 
adjourned to the dining room. Here 
refreshments were served. Cider and 
cakes were enjoyed by all. Smokes 
were in abundance. The meeting ad­
journed at a late hour and everyone 
confessed having a good time.

Big Attendance at Concert.
(Latrobe Bulletin)
Variety was tlie spice of the enjoy­
able concert given by the Carnegie 
Tech Musical Clubs in the locaL high 
school auditorium, last evening.
The concert was heard by the larg­
est: audience ever seen at a college 
glee club event, in Latrobe, and every­
body appeared to like the program im-

one of the most pleasing features of 
the program, and novelty also was af­
forded by the Impersonator of Ray­
mond Hitchcock.
“It; was different.” This >vas the fre- 
quently-'heard comment expressed by 
those in the audience, following the 
concert, and it served to indicate that 
the event had found general favor 
among those who had gotten to think 
that all glee club concerts were more 
or less the same.
The musical numbers, both vocal 
and instrumental, came in for enthus­
iastic applause, - as did the numbers 
presented by the reader.
Following the concert the Tech stu­
dents were the guests of the Senior 
Class at an informal dance, held in 
Mozart Hall.
Last Thursday evening the Carnegie 
Musical Clubs left for Aspinwall on a 
special car to hold a concert in the 
new high school there. Both clubs 
had about fifty-five men along.
An excellent .concert was given be­
fore a large and appreciative audience. 
The performance of Ellerton and 
Sweeny seemed to make a special hit.
After the concert a dance was held 
in the High School Gymnasium.
