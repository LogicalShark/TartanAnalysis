series of four lectures entitled 
“Religion and the Political Choice” 
on Tuesday, October 30, at 11:30 
in the Fine Arts Theatre.
Topic for Talk 
The particular topic upon which 
Father Martin will speak is “Re­
ligion in the Totalitarian State.” 
He will first discuss the histoi'ical 
development of the theory of re­
ligion as the “opiate of the peo­
ple” as formulated by Karl Marx 
and carried out by Lenin and 
Stalin, Then he will present the 
view of the Catholic Church on 
communist doctrine ‘ and he will 
refute the totalitarian teaching.
At the present time, Father 
Martin is assistant chancellor of 
the Pittsburgh Byzanfine Catholic 
diocese and he is also head of the 
college department of the Byzan­
tine Catholic Seminary of Saints 
Cyril and Methodius. He did his

*Aim Of 350 Student Solicitors 
Is 100% Campus Participation
On Monday, October 28, 350 Tech students will begin a week-long 
solicitation of funds for Campus Chest. This will be one of the big­
gest drives for Campus Chest in the history of that organization
—------------------------------------------------------?on the Tech campus.
The solicitors’ job will be to
contact every student of the Tech 
community in order to reach the 
Campus Chest goal set for 1956— 
100 percent participation of the 
student body. The role of the stu­
dent solicitor for Campus Chest 
this year is an important one. He 
is the link between the student 
and the hundreds of welfare 
groups that will benefit by the 
contributions made to Campus 
Chest. With this in mind, Chair­
man of Solicitations Tom Harri­
son has prepared a training pro­
gram by which student solicitors 
will be acquainted with the agen­
cies represented by Campus 
Chest, and with the functioning 
of the organization itself. They 
will also be instructed in the most 
satisfactory and efficient methods 
of reaching the individual Tech 
student and asking his support ©f 
the campaign.
“Operation Education,” as it is 
termed by the Campus Chest Co­
ordinating Committee, will utilize 
the week of October 21-28 to 
“educate” the solicitors about suc­
cessful campaigning. Co-chairmen 
[ of this project are Joanne Lacey

faculty members will be able to

Today, there was no CRA as­
sembly and there will be none 
after next week’s talk until No­
vember 20.
Annual Panhel Formal To Be 
Held In Hotel Webster Hall
Again to be sponsored by the Panhellenic Council on the Tech 
campus, is the annual Panhellenic dance. It is to be held in the 
Georgian Room at Webster Hall on October 27, from 9:00 to 12:30.

Tom Harrison: An All-Around 
Techite In Every Possible Way
Tom Harrison, a senior BMOC, can easily be recognized by his 
efficient walk and friendly personality. A Sloan scholar, Tom came 
to Carnegie Tech because he realized that it is one of the country’s
best engineering schools. ?—----------------------------------------------------
Tom ranks high in scholarship.
He is one of the few men on 
campus to belong to all three of 
the men’s honoraries—Scimitars, 
Delta Skull, and Omicron Delta

chairman of the 1956 Campus 
Chest campaign, Tom says that 
Campus Chest is “important not 
only because of the money it 
raises or the things that the money 
does, but also because it provides 
the means by which we may learn 
to give intelligently.”
As a junior, Tom did a fine job 
as co-chairman of the Leadership 
Conference on Student Council. 
This year he is on the executive 
board of Student Congress. When 
asked what his views on Student 
Government were he replied, “The 
re-organization is something need­
ed. ODK and Mortar Board have 
done their part. Now it remains 
for the rest of the student body to 
support it and make it work.”

Danforth Fund 
Provides Source 
For Grad Students
The Danforth Foundation, an 
educational trust fund in St. Louis, 
Missouri, invites applications for 
the sixth class (1957) of Danforth 
Graduate Fellows from college 
senior men and recent graduates 
who are preparing themselves for 
a career of college teaching, and 
are planning to enter graduate 
school in September, 1957, for 
their first year of graduate study. 
The Foundation welcomes ap­
plicants from the areas of natural 
and biological sciences, social 
sciences, humanities and all fields 
of specialization to be found in 
the undergraduate college.
Dr. Parshali Liaison
President Warner has named 
Dr. Raymond E. Parshali as the 
liaison officer to nominate to the
Danforth Foundation two or not 
to exceed three candidates for 
these fellowships. These appoint­
ments are fundamentally “a re­
lationship of e n c o u r agement” 
throughout the years of graduate 
study, carrying a promise of finan­
cial aid within prescribed condi­
tions as there r.ay be need.
The maximum annual grant for 
single Fellows is $1,800; for mar­
ried Fellows, $2,400 with an addi­
tional stipend for children. Stu­
dents with or without financial 
need are invited to apply. A Dan­
forth Fellow is allowed to carry 
other scholarship appointments, 
such as Rhodes, Fulbright, Wood­
row Wilson, Marshall, etc., cur­
rently with his Danforth Fellow­
ship, and applicants for these ap­
pointments are cordially invited to 
apply at the same time for a Dan­
forth Fellowship. If a man re­
ceives the Danforth Appointment, 
together with a Rhodes Scholar­
ship, Fulbright Scholarship, or 
Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, he 
becomes a Danforth Fellow with­
out stipend, until these other re­
lationships are completed.
All Danforth Fellows will par­
ticipate in the annual Danforth 
Foundation Conference on Teach­
ing, to be held at Camp Mini- 
wanca in Michigan next Septerç} 
ber.

Eggheads To Be 
Found All Over 
Tartan Campus
By Carl Arendt
If someone forced us to name 
what we have read in the last 
week besides Pogo, we would 
have to admit that we’ve been 
reading Newsweek. An enormous 
egg wearing horn*rimmed spec­
tacles leered from the cover, and 
we couldn’t resist. The egghead (a 
pseudo-intellectual with the pow­
er of positive thinking) is, it 
seems, becoming more and more 
important on the American scene. 
Well, this is pretty obvious, and 
we only have to look around cam­
pus to find a good many examples 
of what Newsweek is talking 
about.
No one is very sure whether 
these are real eggheads or only 
imitations, but they fall into 
pretty definite categories. For ex­
ample, there is the Elevated En­
gineer, who has read a book. 
Along with his slide rule, he may 
carry a pocket chess set, a re­
cording of a Bach fugue, or a pa­
per-back copy of “Bonjour Tri- 
stesse.” Sometimes he’s on the 
debate team, and occasionally he 
writes a letter to the Tartan, 
mostly unprintable.
MMCC Has Them
A female egghead may be the 
MMCC, English major. At least, 
she always has an enormous arm­
load of books and must read some 
of them. She is tempermental, and 
usually can be seen in Skibo, 
scribbling by herself or talking 
about her seminars. She always 
nods when a literary reference is 
made and is a “talky” date.
From Fine Arts came the 
“Architectural Aestheic,” who will 
undoubtedly fee Ivy League to the 
core. This alone does not qualify 
him, however; he also has a fine 
collection of Chinese prints, some 
of which he may lend to the Mu­
seum provided due credit is given. 
He knows the proper wine to serve 
with each course, and his plan for 
what the administration could do 
with the Fine Arts Building is ex­
tremely interesting. He is fond of 
explaining his views on almost 
any subject.
An important egghead at this 
time of the year is the “Display 
Planner.” He is a Greek master­
mind, accustomed to thinking big. 
He is more interested in “How?” 
than in “Why?”
S.C. Egghead
There are many others, but the 
“Solid Citizen” is perhaps the 
most common of all. He is some­
times surrounded by great clouds 
of pipe smoke and talks constant­
ly with lots of enthusiasm. He 
knows his own limitations and 
manages to cover up for them 
nicely—if he’s in E & S he takes 
lots of soc rel courses. He’s in­
terested in campus doings, may be 
on Student Council, and is a con-

Alpha Phi Omega 
Working Hard On 
Tech “C” Book
Hard at work on the 1956-57 
“C” Book is Alpha Phi Omega, 
Tech’s service fraternity. A sort 
of campus phone directory, the 
“C” Book also includes a complete 
listing of Tech student organiza­
tions and their officers.
The organization and compila­
tion of the “C” Book is just one 
facet of APhiO’s service program. 
Included in this program are such 
projects as conducting all campus 
elections, helping with the Cam­
pus Chest campaigns, coat check­
ing and selling refreshments at 
dances, organization and main­
tenance of the food concessions at 
Spring Carnival, and campus 
tours, just to mention a few.
National Organization
Alpha Phi Omega is a national 
service fraternity composed of 
college men who have been at 
some time affiliated with the Boy 
Scouts. Formed to promote friend­
ship and service to fellowmen, the 
program of APhiO embodies four 
fields of activity. Service to the 
student body and faculty, service 
to youth and community, service 
to members of the fraternity, and 
service to the nation as participat­
ing citizens.
APhiO has its light side too, 
with an annual picnic, fall hay- 
ride and the famous “Ugly Man’’ 
contest.
MARKING ON THE CURVE... 
AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT
* Twonkey Crimscott was a professor. Choate Sigafoos
was a sophomore. Twonkey Crimscott was keen, cold, 
brilliant. Choate Sigafoos wa3 loose, vague, adenoidal. 
Twonkey Crimscott believed in diligence, discipline, and 
marking on the curve. Choate Sigafoos believed in elves, 
Jayne Mansfield, and thirteen hours sleep each night.
Yet there came a time when Twonkey Crimscott — 
mentor, sage, and savant — was thoroughly out-thought, 
out-foxed, out-maneuvered, out-ployed, and out-witted 
by Choate Sigafoos, sophomore.
ff! It happened one day when Choate was at the library 
studying for one of Mr. Crimscott’s exams in sociology. 
Mr. Crimscott’s exams were murder — plain, flat murder. 
They consisted of one hundred questions, each question 
having four possible answers—A, B, C, and D. The trouble 
was that the four choices were so subtly shaded, so in­
tricately worded, that students more clever by far than 
Choate Sigafoos were often set to gibbering.
So on this day Choate sat in the library poring over 
his sociology text, his tiny brow furrowed with concen­
tration, while all around him sat the other members of 
|£ the sociology class, every one studying like crazy. *‘What
a waste!” he thought. “All this youth, this verve, this 
bounce, chained to musty books in a musty library! We 
should be out singing and dancing and smooching and 
cutting didoes on the greensward!”
Then, suddenly, an absolute gasser of an idea hit 
, Choate. “Listen!” he shouted to his classmates. “Tomor­
row when we take the exam, let’s all — every one of us — 
check Choice ‘A’ on every question — every one of them."
“Huh?” said his classmates.
“Mr. Crimscott marks on the curve. If we all check 
W the same answers then we all get the same score, and
everybody in the class gets a *C\”
“Hmm,” said his classmates.
“Let’s get out of here and have a ball!” said Choate.
So they all ran out and lit Philip Morrises and had 
a ball, as, indeed, you will too when you light a Philip 
Morris, for if there ever was a cigarette to lift the spirit 
and gladden the heart, it is today’s new Philip Morris— 
firm and pure and fragrant and filled with true, natural, 
golden tobacco, lip end to tip end.
te
\^11 sir, the next morning the whole class did what 
Choate said and, sure enough, they all got “C*s,” and they 
picked Choate up and carried him on their shoulders and 
sang “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow” and plied him with 
sweetmeats and Philip Morris and girls and put on 
buttons which said “I DOTE ON CHOATE.”
But they were celebrating too soon. Because the next 
^ time shrewd old Mr. Crimscott gave them a test, he gave 
them only one question—to wit: write a 30,000 word 
essay on “Crime Does Not Pay.”
“You and your ideas,” they said to Choate and tore 
off his epaulets and broke his sword and drummed him 
out of the school. Today, a broken man, he earns a meager 
living as a camshaft in Toledo.

J. Paul Sheedy* Wasn’t Very Sharp Till 
Wildroot Crcam-Oil Gave Him Confidence
"WHY do the girls act so stuck up?" moaned Sheedy. "It’s quilling me the 
way they give me the brush-off.” "It’s your hair, J. Paul,” said one of
the lads. “It sticks out all over. Confidentially, it stings. You need
Wildroot Cream-Oil.” So Sheedy picked up a bottle.
Now he has all kinds of confidence, because his hair 
looks healthy and handsome, the way Nature intended.

Incentives
Now that Homecoming is behind us and 
school well underway, we might stop and 
look to see where we’re going. Midsemester 
is not far off, and right now we’ve got to 
decide between the B in psychology and 
Thursday night down at Harry’s with the 
boys.
The question is, are marks really worth 
it? Many students feel that education is edu­
cation, regardless of whether we get C’s or 
A’s; perhaps the high-ranking students are 
more eligible for leading jobs in their field,
At any rate, what Immediate incentives are 
there to draw us from that Skibo coffee cup 
up to the library—other than the hour exam 
tomorrow?
Aside from the Dean’s List (recognizing 
the upper 10 percent of the school), there 
are many honors given for skill and diligence 
in all areas on campus well worth going 
after. The class honoraries, for instance, rec­
ognize students outstanding in scholarship, 
leadership and service, and are highly re­
spected on this campus and, for the national 
ones, by people across the nation. In addition 
to the honor of being called to these organiza­
tions, the members benefit from the activities of the groups, 
including both worthwhile projects for the school and social 
functions for the groups themselves.
Not all honorary societies require activity from their 
members. Phi Kappa Phi, equivalent to Phi Beta Kappa, 
is purely honorary. Tau Beta Pi, the Phi Beta Kappa of 
engineering, does tutoring, but most of the departmental 
honoraries merely recognize the students outstanding in 
their particular field.
Pi Delta Epsilon, the journalism honorary, functions to 
keep the standards of the campus publications high—and to 
entertain the members of PiDE and the publications. This 
and similar honoraries place high values on the experience 
and enjoyment derived from working with others in a worth­
while organization.
The point of all this is that students should really study 
because the mere experience of learning is so thrilling, and 
for those who feel they need more tangible incentives there 
are all sorts of laurels to be won. Those who are honoraries, 
who have won the right to wear Phi Kappa Phi or Tau Beta 
Pi keys, feel that the prestige, the contacts, and the fun are 
well worth the effort of studying a little harder.
Helping Others
The remarkable success of last year’s Campus Chest 
campaign has set a challenging precedent. However, Evelyn 
Alessio, Tom Harrison, and Julie Nash, the able leaders of 
this year’s team, seem to be well aware of the task before 
them, and are fully prepared, not only to meet the challenge 
of last year’s campaign, but to set a new record.
One way they hope to gain the support of the entire 
campus is through education. We agree that if people are 
aware of the truly good causes to which the funds will be 
given, they will be more than willing to give what little they 
can.
Last year the Tech campaign was selected as a model 
for campus chest organizations on other campus. We’d like 
to see this repeated, not so much because of the prestige, 
which is certainly fine to have, but because it represents a 
willingness on the part of the students to help others less 
fortunate than they. S.A.M.

Notas De Un Oyente
By Luis de la Macorra
Some of the fraternities on campus are a little 
worried and surprised at the same time. It seems 
that quite a few have noticed that the plaques 
with the greek letters, usually at the front of the 
houses, are not there any more. Even the isolated 
stronghold of the Clyde Street Boys Cub is missing 
its shiny sign.
Doing some research on this matter, I came 
upon the shocking answer to the riddle. It seems 
that a small group of vengeful W&J students has 
been roaming the campus, and is planning a big 
scale raid on our sacred ground. The reason is that 
they have been unable to wash the paint off of 
their campus sidewalks. This fact, in addition to 
the way a similar group was caught by surprise 
last year, filled each and everyone with a very 
strong desire for revenge.
Knowing that, due to Homecoming, everybody 
around here would be either too tired or too busy, 
W&J men sent scouts this past week to look over 
our campus. These few fellows decided to take 
some of the fraternity plaques, and have the fra­
ternities here blaming each other. I am not sure 
that they will ever send the plaques back to us, 
as they were pretty mad about the whole thing 
last year. I advise the fraternities to start making 
provisions for buying new ones, and to keep watch­
ful eyes on the ones that still are where they 
should be.
Well, changing the subject, it seems that the
About News Review
-a
This year the Tartan introduced a new policy— 
that of trying to report national as well as campus 
news.
It is felt that coverage of this type is needed 
here at Tech where sometimes study pressures are 
so heavy on some that the reading of the daily 
paper is neglected. How common it is to hear— 
“I haven’t seen a paper in weeks. I haven’t thvy 
vaguest idea what’s going on in the world” or 
many similar statements.
For this reason the Tartan has been printing 
stories from the Students for Stevenson and Stu­
dents for Eisenhower committees and has set aside 
space for a weekly summary of the news. This 
column is a condensation of what is considered to 
by the best review of the week’s news—The New 
York Times’ “News of the Week in Review.”
The writer of this column has tried to present 
the issues in an unbiased manner. But letters ariD 
comments that have come into the Tartan office 
from people who do have time to read several 
different papers a week seem to indicate that per­
haps this column is not giving both sides to the 
issues. However, with these complaints come no 
suggestions on what the Tartan can do to solve 
the problem.
The Tartan is now faced with the questions: 
Do the students want national news coverage? If 
so, do they want short summaries of many issuer 
or do they want longer summaries of only a few 
world problems? Are there enough students in­
terested in the world about them to write letters 
to the Tartan asking for coverage of or question­
ing issues which because of space could not be 
reported in full?
The Tartan would greatly appreciate any com­
ments from the student body concerning this mat­
ter of policy and will try to carry out any reason­
able suggestions made. Until such a time it will 
continue to use the news summary from the Ne/r 
York Times as it has been.
Letters
Foreign Policy
October 9, 1956
Editor, The ManyaVi
I would like to point out a few statements that 
appeared in Elliott Rothman’s article in the Octo­
ber 9 issue, which, to me, seem much more tha£j 
slightly misleading. Mr. Rothman criticizes the 
peace of the Eisenhower administration, and cites 
the current difficulties in Jordan and Suez. Mr. 
Rothman, are American boys being killed in Jordan 
and Suez? And, incidently, if these spots are so 
serious, how can Stevenson promise to stop the 
draft and H-bomb research?
Mr. Rothman, you also critcize the administra­
tion’s Foreign Policy. You must know what you 
are talking about. Please tell me how you, as a 
college student, know the officially secret plans of' 
the State Department? May I comment that no 
Republican “blunders” (if they exist) have re­
sulted in a “police action” that killed American 
soldiers.
You snidely snip at the Open Skies proposal, 
yet what did Truman accomplish? If the Russians 
were so amused, why did they, repeatedly flatly 
turn the proposal down? If you are amused, it 
would seem that you are not acquainted with the 
powers of modern aerial photography.
You say that the Republicans failed to support 
nations such as India. Has India asked for our 
support? Has what American money the Demo­
cratic administration gave away helped gain us 
any friends?
As to the Democratic use of military might in 
diplomatic relations, I can only answer: Korea!
Sincerely yours, 
Bruce Gowens.
Scotch and Soda Club is starting to work earlier- 
this year. All the members of the organization 
realize that they will have to work very hard to 
present a better show than ‘Head Over Heels.’ The 
way it looks now is that they will do it. The 
writers have already begun their work undi^r the 
able direction of Bill Longyear, and the publicity 
department is already thinking how to attract peo­
ple to the show. I personally would like to wish 
them the best of luck . . .
This week, I would like to add a couple of, 
words with respect to our yearbook. A few weeks 
ago I said that last year’s Thistle had been lousy. 
Nevertheless, this year I am positive that the book 
will be much better.
It is very easy to see why this will be so. The 
staff has already begun to work, taking pictures, 
organizing the staff, defining the particular jobsr 
and what is more important, doing them well. 
Therefore, I would like to give this year’s Thistle 
staff a word of confidence, knowing that they will 
produce the best yearbook ever . . . and so, I 
will just add “Hasta la vista and buena suerte..

Temple Weathers Tartan Rally
By Sherry Newmark ?
At Temple Stadium last Saturday the Carnegie Tech Tartans 
ran into stiff opposition as they were dropped 27 to 12 by the Temple 
Owls.
Under a hot sun the Temple partisan crowd of about 4000 watched 
¦m Cherry and White line
age weight 213 pounds) battle it 
out with the outmanned but not 
outmaneuvered Tartan line (av­
erage weight 179). The game was 
remarkably close considering the 
score; the difference lay in the 
fact that Temple was able to 
capitalize on a few Carnegie mis­
takes.
Tommy Briner was outstanding 
for Tech both on offense and de- 
ifiae. His inspired play gave the 
outweighed Carnegie line the 
spark they needed at critical 
points.
Frank Zinni took the Temple 
opening kickoff and carried to the 
30. Tuci’s pass to Ficery was in­
tercepted and a few minutes later 
it loked as if the “Cherry Pink 
and Apple Blossom White” boys 
were on the move. However, Tony 
Capul became man of the hour 
f|r recovering a fumble on the 
Tech 20. But the Tartans, un­
able to generate an offense, were 
forced to punt. Temple immedi­
ately showed their powers by de­
veloping a sustained drive which 
carried them to a hard-fought 
touchdown. The point attempt 
was good.
The Temple kickoff was taken 
by Jeep Myers who carried to 
iKe 34. Quatse went around end 
a first down. But a Tucci pass 
was fumbled and Temple recov­
ered. Shortly afterward Tech took 
over on downs, Temple having 
run into a determined Carnegie 
Tech brick wall. A pass from Tuc- 
ic to Cassett who lateraled to 
Briner was good for 20 yards. A 
pitchout to Briner made 4 yards 
but two incomplete passes set up 
a punting situation; unfortunate 
oal Tucci’s punt was blocked. 
iSice again Temple was stopped 
cold ?nd Briner took the punt 
deep in Tech territory. Quatse 
went for 15 yards around end 
and Majeski carried for 8 more 
yards, but at this point the Tech 
attack bogged down, Tucci’s punt 
was fumbled and Tech took over 
on Temple’s 22. It looked as if 
Tech might even the score but 
the Temple secondary soont
anged that outlook as the right 
If intercepted a Tucci pass and 
raced all the way to the Tech 20 
where Tucci, the last man be­
tween the ball and the goal, 
fought off blockers to make the 
tackle. The Owls, unable to pene­
trate the line, scored on a 20 yard 
pass play. The point attempt was 
wide.
Briner took the kickoff to the 
30. A long Tucci pass was inter-
Teeh Runners Win 
Triad Meet; Lose 
To Slippery Rock
In the past week the Tech thin- 
clads encountered an array of 
meets and weather resulting in 
two new victories and a loss to 
add to their record. As a result 
Ik thinclads now sport a record 
of four wins and two losses.
Last Tuesday Coach Carman’s 
crew played host to Case and W. 
& J. in a triangular meet run on 
the Schenley Park course. For 
some reason the meet was scored 
as two dual meets in which Tech 
beat Case 23-33 and W. & J. 23- 
34. Larry Bryant and Eric Otter- 
vik tied for first place for the 
home team finishing in 24 minutes 
30 seconds. Milroth took third 
for W. & J., Olds fourth for Tech, 
and the best Case’s number one 
man could finish was fifth.
The thinclads lost a heartbreak- 
er Saturday amidst mud and rain 
on Slippery Rock’s four-mile 
course. Not only was the team 
beaten but Ottervik, the number 
one man, was bested which is an 
unusual occurrence. This coming 
Friday Carman’s boys will meet 
^fcstminster on tne Schenley Park 
course.
cepted and once more a long pass 
by the Temple QB took the ball 
to the 5. After a line buck and a 
quarterback sneak, Temple had 
another 6 points. Point was good. 
Myers returned the kick to the 
27 as the half ended.
A fired-up and determined Tech 
team came on the field as the 
second half started and it was 
immediately evident that the 
Tartans meant business. Briner 
carried for 15. Majeski gained 
three. A Tucci pass to Briner was 
good for 20. Majeski made three. 
A pass to Briner gained 10 yards
and another to Ficery gained 12. 
A pass to Majeski was good for 
11 yards. At this point the Cherry 
and White boys were penalized 
to the two where Tucci carried 
for the TD.
Ramsey kicked off but Temple 
fumbled and Love recovered. 
However, the Tartan offense 
couldn’t get started and Temple 
took over on downs. Temple, un­
able to move, punted. A Tucci 
pass was intercepted and at this 
point two obvious blunders by the 
officials gave the Owls their 4th 
touchdown. After having gained 
7 yards on three attempts Temple 
made a first down after one of 
their linesman was off-side. From 
here they scored on a 30 yard 
run which included a forward
lateral. The point attempt was 
good. Tech received the kickoff 
but were forced to punt. Myers 
recovered a Temple fumble short­
ly before the game ended, but 
time had run out.

IM Football Leagues 
Are Swept By Upsets
Im football was hit by a wave* 
of upsets as the previously un­
ranked Beta Sigs, TXs and SAEs 
defeated the Sigma Nus, DUs and 
ATOs respectively.
In Tartan League action, Sigma 
Nu suffered an unexpected 20 to 
19 defeat to the hard - charging 
Beta Sigs. Waxman did some ex­
cellent passing to lead his team 
to victory in the last minute of 
play. However, the league favor­
ite, Phi Kaps managed to quell the 
Beta Sig uprising, conquering 
them 18 to 10. Hvizdos, Phi Kap 
quarterback, threw two long 
touchdown passes to Kaiser and 
also ran well to lead the Phi Kap 
offense. Sigma Nu must now de­
feat the Phi Kaps to stay in 
league contention. This contest 
will be played on October 31. The 
Static Charges won two games, 
11-3 over ASCE, and 28-7 over 
the Grad Iggles.
Skibo League: Delts 
DU, Skibo League contenders, 
also suffered a one point upset 
defeat to the TXs. The Theta Xi 
team, which did not seem to have 
a chance to win, used several long 
scoring plays in gaining victory. 
The Delts, led by Laughery and 
Mihm, then trimmed the DUs 14-8 
to virtually knock them out of 
contention. It now appears that 
the Delts will win the Skibo crown 
running away. The Met Grads 
showed surprising power in 
trampling the Trojans 29-1. Hirth 
caught two TD passes to lead the 
Metallurgists to victory. The Tro­
jans came back to stop the Clyde 
Street A. C. 11-8.
SAE Upsets ATO 
Perhaps the biggest upset of the 
season occurred as the SAEs de­
feated a highly ranked ATO team 
18 to 12. The SAE line was the 
main factor in gaining the victory 
as it held the ATO offense time 
and again. ATO, however, -re­
bounded to defeat the DU “B 
team 38 to 6. Meanwhile, the 
Kappa Sigs overwhelmed the SAE 
team 35 to 3 to remain unde­
feated in Kiltie League play. ATO 
must defeat the Clyde Streeters 
to stay in league contention. PiKA 
ran over the Obelisks 18-7 after 
losing to Citcom, 10-2.

Volleyball Close
The co-rec volleyball season is 
only a week old, but there have 
been enough close games to take 
years off the players’ lives. The 
four combinations are PiKA-In- 
dependents, Delts-ChiOs, Sigma- 
Nus-Thetas, and Betas-Kappas.
A climactic battle between PiKA 
and the Delts has shaped up. 
PiKA topped the Betas and Sigma 
Nus although they lost the- first 
game of a best-of-three in each 
instance. The Delts had an easier 
time beating Sigma Nu, but barely 
pulled their game with the Betas 
out of the fire. The winner of the 
Delt - PiKA game will be the 
champion.
W. & J. Next On 
Tartan Schedule
The Tartans’ most played op­
ponent, W & J, comes here this 
Saturday to play in the 29th tilt 
between the two clubs. Under 
their new coach Ed Chupa, the 
Prexies are doing quite well. They 
whipped Grove City in their 
opener, tied Allegheny 14-14, 
dropped Case 21-0, and lost to 
Thiel last Saturday, 33-6.
W & J, in addition to being 
Tech’s longest rival, is the oldest. 
The series began in Tech’s first 
season in 1906 with W & J blank­
ing Tech 34-0. The Presidents hold

Believing that the future of aviation lay with larger 
aircraft, higher speeds and greater ranges, the found­
ers of Pratt & Whitney Aircraft established an iron­
clad policy demanding constant striving to develop 
* aircraft engines that would continually surpass pre­
vious accomplishments. The intervening restless years 
at P & W A have been filled with continuing progress 
which proved the wisdom of, that early decision. 
' Brand new areas of technology were explored; rec­
ognition as undisputed leader in its field was at­
tained; expansion to accommodate the growth of 
the company resulted in a nationwide network of 
auxiliary facilities.
Florida — long America’s year ’round playground 
—* is now providing ground for the continued expan­
sion of America’s foremost aircraft engine builder.
World’s foremost designer and builder of aircraft engines
Ideally located in Palm Beach County, P & W A’s 
newest facility will be an important engineering 
auxiliary to the main laboratories and plants in 
Connecticut. Major factors in selecting the site were 
the mild climate and sufficient isolation to permit 
development and test of highly advanced and ex­
tremely powerful jet engines with minimum acous­
tical disturbance to the surrounding resort com­
munities.
The engineering graduate who begins his career 
at this Florida facility will have the rare opportunity 
of keeping pace with its anticipated growth. In an 
organization renowned for development engineering 
superiority, he will be able to gain invaluable ex­
perience working on vital, long-range projects that 
are a challenge to the imagination.

Sideline News 
And Views
By John Van Holt, Jr.
According to “Executrend”, a 
monthly survey of business posi­
tions, the demand for engineer­
ing executives is leading the over­
all management personnel ma- 
ket, and has increased to 33% 
over the June-December period 
of last year.
This survey is conducted by 
Heidrick and Struggles, a Chicago 
executive recruiting firm, and is 
made on the basis of the number 
of management positions display 
advertised in the ten most pop­
ulated areas in the United States.
Get Well, Kathy
It was recently disclosed at the 
last session of Student Council 
that Kathy Galligan, a former 
student, is recuperating from a 
serious operation performed dur­
ing the summer. Kathy, prior to 
her illness, was a very active 
member of Newman Club, Phi 
Gamma Pi Sorority, and Student 
Council.
It would be a very fine gesture
for those of you wno know her, 
and to the few of you who don’t, 
to saddle Uncle Sam’s bearer of 
tidings (mailman) with many 
bags full of “get-well” cards. 
Kathy’s address is 1731 Limehol- 
low Road, Pittsburgh, Pa.
Lillian A. Wasileski, a first 
year student in the department of 
fine arts, was unanimously chosen 
as recording secretary of Student

Anyone for Basketball?
As a means of adding a little 
bit of variety to the school pro­
gram of the male evening stu­
dent I have pondered over the 
possibility of organizing interest­
ed students on a sports program 
between fraternity members, club 
members, and independents.
It is felt that such a venture 
will create a closer bond between 
many of the students who may 
opine that evening students, as 
a whole, are not an enthusiastic 
group. If interested, contact this 
writer via the campus post office 
box 256.
Oh yes. The bowling teams are

Dear Old Dad 
Hero Of Chest
Question of the Week: 
What’s the Campus Chest? 
Answer:
Once upon a time there was a 
very, unhappy student body at 
a very well known college. This 
group was most sorrowful, for al­
most every week some worth 
while agency had a campaign and, 
being generous, public spirited 
citizens, they dutifully put their 
quarters and dimes in each box 
that came along. As a result, they 
seldom could afford a cup of cof­
fee or an ice cream cone, and 
therefore had no excuse to pat­
ronize the campus cafeteria. With 
no money to spend and no place 
else to go, they resorted to going 
to classes eight hours a day. This, 
of course, made them very in­
telligent but also very unhappy.
One day, one of the brokest and 
smartest of the students, who 
boasted seventeen tag-day pop­
pies in each lapel, a sleeve-full of 
assorted campaign buttons, and an 
“I gave” sticker glued jauntily 
across the toe of each sneaker, 
came up with a brilliant idea. 
Dear Old Dad had just come 
through with a month’s allow­
ance, and as he stood with the 
dollar clutched in his ink-stained 
hand, he shouted: “Eureka!” (All 
important discoveries are herald­
ed in this manner.) “I shall solve 
my financial dilemma! I shall put 
my whole dollar in an envelope 
and address it to ALL the social 
agencies. They can divide it up 
among themselves and then next 
month when Dear Old Dad sends 
me another dollar, I can keep 
some of it to buy an ice cream 
cone at the college cafeteria.” 
The following month, sure 
enough, Dear Old Dad came 
through, and our hero, conscience 
clear, passed by each campaign

Bill Longyear 
To Head S n’ S
This year Bill Longyear, a di­
recting major of the drama de­
partment, will be head writer for 
the annual Scotch and Soda show. 
Although the ideas for the pro­
duction are still in the tentative 
state, Bill plans to have a show 
similar to last year’s, in that it 
will be in the round and will be on 
the review idea.
Bill, who is now working as a 
senior in directing, has worked on 
Scotch and Soda for three years. 
He has had experience in sum­
mer stock, working this summer 
as a stage carpenter and a lighting 
designer.
Anyone with any ideas for 
songs, lyrics, and sketches will be 
welcomed at the Seotch and Soda 
meetings held on Sunday after­
noons in Morewood Gardens. 
Scotch and Soda’s aim this year 
is to make the show worth any­
one’s time and money to attend. 
Bill hopes to make Scotch and 
Soda outstanding.

box. Each campaigner holding 
each box waved to him as he 
breezed by, for they knew that he 
had already done his share.
Well, on he went to the campus 
cafeteria and invested in an ice 
cream cone, double scoop. And 
when the other students saw his 
contented poppy-less, button-less 
shape stroll down the street, they 
shouted, “Eureka!” (They had no 
originality). Eyeing the ice cream 
cone they added, “This is for us! 
We too, shall give to all agencies 
at one time!” And do you know, 
that is just what they did.
They founded an organization, 
Campus Chest, which is now na­
tion-wide. Campus Chest is the

give to the social agencies better, 
more efficient service — all at

Performance Determines 
Advancement At Melpar
At Melpar there is no waiting 
period for “automatic” advance­
ment. Instead, an engineer, regard­
less of his age or tenure, may move 
ahead as rapidly as his skill and 
performance dictate. Each engi­
neer’s achievement Is reviewed at 
least twice a year. In this manner 
engineers deserving advancement 
can be quickly “spotted” and pro 
moted. As soon as an engineer is 
ready for more complex responsi­
bilities they are given him.
