Sexual assault policy approved
By ERIN GRUNZKE
Tartan Staflwriter
A new sexual assault policy 
has been officially approved by 
the Faculty and Student Sen­
ates. The revised policy changes 
will provide assault victims with 
easy access to advisors and legal 
procedures dealing with sexual 
assault.
The new policy provides as­
sault victims with multiple con­
tact points via a panel of advi­
sors. The panel consists of stu­
dents, faculty, and other advi­
sors, including the directors of 
the counseling center and coun­
seling services. The wide range 
of advisors and their levels of 
authority are chosen to provide
the assault victim the greatest 
possible degree of comfort when 
discussingthe assault and avail­
able options.
While prior CMU sexual as­
sault policies exist, this policy 
has more personalized inten­
tions thanits predecessors. Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy said, “The policy is im­
portant because it is one way we 
can make a clear affirmative 
statement on campus, and be­
cause it is a very underreported 
issue on all colleges, not exclud­
ing Carnegie Mellon.”
The new policy hopes to in­
voke better assault awareness, 
while providing assault victims 
withinformation concemingthe 
processes and procedures in­
volved in reporting sexual as­
sault, knowing how the case will 
be handled, and allowing the 
victim to maintain total control 
of the situation. The victim can 
receive support in a discrete 
manner while maintaining con­
fidentiality.
CMU provides the individual 
with other services besides coun­
seling. The victim can receive 
directmedical treatment andre- 
ferral to additional medical and 
counseling support if needed.
The victim is given total con­
trol of the situation. The policy 
states, “no disciplinary or other 
action is taken ... without the 
clear, informed agreement of the 
individual bringing the charge 
forward.”

Programmer alleges 
Pentagon involvement
By RICH KWIATOWSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
Pete Shell, a research pro­
grammer in the School of Com­
puter Science, presented a docu­
ment which alleges that CMU 
scientists are engaged in De­
fense Advanced Research Pro­
jects Agency (DARPA) research, 
at a press conference last Mon­
day.
The document is a result of a 
meeting between the military, 
CIA and top researchers from 
colleges and universities from 
around the country, including 
scientists from Carnegie Mellon 
University. The document fo­
cused on how to make univer­
sity research directly helpful to 
the military. This more direct 
research would be carried out in 
several areas: bomb damage
assessment, fully automated 
bombing, unmanned guided ve­
hicles, automatic target track­
ing and weapon guidance and 
autonomous helicopters.
According to Shell, these re­
search projects “only serve to 
make weapons more deadly. At 
the same time, automization will
make war more acceptable to 
the United States.” Shell also 
holds that this document runs 
counter to official Carnegie Mel­
lon University press releases 
that the university does not de­
velop weapons systems. Shell 
says, “[The University] does not
just engage in general research, 
rather it is a direct research 
branch of the Pentagon. Carn­
egie Mellon is an integral part, 
it is a muchneeded part of mili­
tary research. Without univer­
sities, the Pentagon would not
have these weapon systems.” 
The only Carnegie Mellon 
University scientists named in 
the document were David 
McKeown of SCS, Takeo Kanade 
of The Robotics Institute, and 
Chuck Thorpe of SCS. These

Mehrabian talks 
with faculty
By MIKE KUNSMANN
Tartan Staffwriter
University President Robert 
Mehrabian presented the fac­
ulty with information on Carn­
egie Mellon University’s stand­
ing and its future. Mehrabian 
addressed six issues: Our Vi­
sion, Mission Statement, New 
Appointments and Manage­
ments, Advisory Boards, Capi­
tal Projects, and the Strategic 
Analysis and Plan to Meet our 
Vision.
Mehrabian introduced “Our 
Vision,” which is the goal to be a 
first-rate university—one that 
influences the behavior of other 
institutions by leading and by 
establishing new directions.
He also addressed CMU’s 
“Mission Statement:” to create 
and disseminate knowledge 
through research, teaching, and 
a transfer to the society.
Mehrabian said, “It’s a rap­
idly changing world and we have 
to participate [in this change].”
Mehrabian also said that it is 
CMU1 s mission to strive for lead­
ership and innovation through 
excellence and quality in its cho­
sen fields of endeavor, and that 
diversity provides great general 
openness towards any kind of 
research.
Next, Mehrabian announced 
some of the new appointments 
in the administration. Provost 
Paul Cristiano,Vice-Provost for 
Undergraduate Education
Erwin Steinberg, GSIA Dean 
Robert Sullivan, CIT Dean 
Stephen Director, and MCS 
Dean Susan Henry haverecently 
been appointed.
Mehrabian told the faculty 
that the six advisory boards that 
visited CMU’s campus prepared 
critiques, and that CMU has 
started taking steps to incorpo­
rate the board’s suggestions.
Mehrabian then discussed the 
Capital Projects. “We have em­
barked on a comprehensive capi­
tal budget plan for the Univer­
sity,” he said. In the coming 
year a document will be pro­
duced that will pull together and 
prioritize all the University 
projects. According to Meh­
rabian the projects need a fund­
ing of $95.6 million. Of that 
amount, only 35.5 million has 
been raised. Current projects 
include the GSIA Building, the 
EMTB, the University Center, 
the Center of the Arts, and the 
chemistry labs.
Mehrabian then went into his 
final point: the Strategic Analy­
sis and Plan to Meet CMU’s Vi­
sion. He divided this section 
into three parts: Resources and 
Size, Undergraduate Education 
and Graduate Education, and 
Research.
Mehrabian said that the Uni­
versity ended the fiscal year with 
a modest surplus. He announced 
that the GSIA building would be 
done on time and on budget.

Parking rates
will increase
Figuresof Business Services John Lin/ Tartan Art Editor
By RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Students who plan to bring 
their cars to campus next se­
mester should have no problem 
doing so — unless, of course, 
they want to park somewhere. 
Student drivers will be hit with 
a double wallop next semester 
as on-campus parking rates in­
crease an average of 17 percent, 
while off-campus parking in 
Squirrel Hill is sharply curtailed 
by an expansion of the resident 
permit parking system.
Planned increases in campus
parking permit rates for the 
1991-1992 academic year were 
put on hold to compensate for an 
employee salary freeze. The 
freeze was in effect from July to 
October and was enacted in re­
sponse to a threatened reduc­
tion in federal research dollars.
In a memo to the campus 
community issued last Wednes­
day, President Robert 
Mehrabian announced that due 
to a delay of the federal fund 
reductions and what he called 
an “internal restructuring” of

Henry appointed MCS dean
By LAURA PAL ANKER
Tartan Staffwriter
Susan Henry was recently 
appointed dean of Mellon Col­
lege of Science. Henry formerly 
held the position of head of the 
Biological Science Department.
Robert Sekurka relinquished 
the dean position in MCS in Sep­
tember of this year, returning to 
his former position as professor 
of physics. While Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology’s Dean 
Robert Kail temporarily filled 
the position, the Faculty Com­
mittee chose to ask Henry to be 
the new Dean. Henry accepted 
the proposition earlier this 
month.
As dean, Henry wants to con­
tinue some of her own practices 
as well as begin some new ones. 
“I would like for the College of 
Science to become an entity with 
which students identify,” said
Henry. “There should be greater 
interaction between faculty and 
students.” She would also like to 
institute “a greater level of ser­
vices — advising, career choices
—for a wider range of students.” 
Within the college, Henry wants 
to upgrade the laboratories in 
chemistry and physics. “I would 
like them to be a showplace —
the best laboratories in the coun­
try,” said Henry.
She’d also like to reexamine 
the course currículums “to con­
sider the way science is done in
the outside world.” Within her 
personal scope, Henry is excited 
to get more involved with under­
graduate studies again. She’ll 
teach freshman biology in the 
spring. “I came to Carnegie 
Mellon from a medical school 
because I wanted to get back 
into undergraduate education. 
Teaching and working with stu­
dents is my first priority. As 
dean I’ll continue that.”
Henry received her bachelor 
of science in zoology from the 
University of Maryland in 1968. 
She went on to the University of 
California at Berkeley to pursue 
her doctorate in genetics. Dur­
ing this time, several incidents

White House, Congress duel over tax cut plans
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22, (DJ)—The 
push for a middle class tax cut picked 
up over the weekend what it had lacked 
for most of 1991 — momentum.
The idea has been boosted by Senate 
Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, who 
floated a five-year $72 billion plan Sunday, 
and by a growing awareness among Demo­
crats that the White House is looking for a 
legislative jolt to the economy.
“The combination of those two has 
created some momentum,” said House 
Budget Chairman Leon Panetta (D- 
Calif.) who said the tax fever gripping 
Capitol Hill rightly should be called: 
“Can You Top This?”
Before this weekend, the House 
Democratic caucus was split among 
those who favored delay on tax legisla­
tion, notably Ways and Means Chair­
man Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), and 
those who wanted quick action, notably 
House Majority Leader Richard 
Gephardt (D-Mo.)
Now Rostenkowski appears tb be the 
lone Democratic leader holding back— 
and even he is dragged along. Speaker 
Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) said today 
that Rostenkowski’s tax-writing com­
mittee will mark-up legislation this fall, 
and that the bill will be brought to the 
floor before Thanksgiving.
“We can find time for a tax bill, I 
think, before we leave, and that’s what 
I am hoping we will be able to do,” Foley 
said. “We are seeking to develop a pro­
gram which would both stimulate the 
economy, which is in a very difficult 
and constricted state at the moment, 
and also to bring a greater element of 
fairness and relief to middle-income 
families who are particularly bearing 
the burden both of the cost of govern­
ment and the effects of the recession.”
Foley’s comments put him squarely 
in Bentsen’s camp. One of the more 
conservative lawmakers, Bentsen (D- 
Texas) has provided cover for Demo­
crats who want to move forward.
Bentsen’s plan couples a $300 tax 
credit for each child in a taxpayer’s 
family with expansion of the tax ben­
efits of the Individual Retirement Ac­
count. It would be paid for with a 5 
percent cut in defense spending.
“There was no chance before 
Bentsen,” said Rep. Thomas Downey 
(D-N.Y.). “Now at least there is an out­
side chance.”
Democrats also cited the White House 
search for a legislative stimulus to the 
economy as providing impetus for a 
middle class tax cut. President Bush is 
talking to GOP congressional leaders 
about a proposal — the centerpiece of 
which would be a cut in the tax on 
capital gains — aimed at pulling the 
economy out of its sluggish state.
Although that initiative has been in 
the public domain for several days, 
Democrats are acting as if they’ve just 
learned about it. “What’s changed is 
the administration’s sense that the 
economy is slipping deeper into reces­
sion,” Rep. Downey said.
“There’s more concern that the 
economy is a basket case; everyone feels 
it,” said Rep. David Bonior (D-Mich.), 
the House Democratic Whip. “The 
White House is panicky on the economy, 
as they well should.”
Foley and other House* Democratic 
leaders favor a middle class tax plan 
similar to Bentsen’s, except that they 
would pay for it with increased taxes on 
the very wealthy, not defense cuts. That 
idea is opposed by the White House,
which wants to cut the tax on capital 
gains from long-term investments.
Foley chided the administration for 
persisting in its support of a capital 
gains cut, which he said would benefit 
the wealthy.
“That’s their answer to tax reform. 
That’s their answer to tax fairness,” 
Foley said. “That’s their answer to eco­
nomic stimulation: help the rich and 
the wealthy get richer and wealthier. 
And I don’t think that represents what 
the American people want or what we 
need in this country at this time.”
It now appears increasingly likely 
that the separate moves for unemploy­
ment benefits and tax cuts are going to 
clash this fall, although congressional 
leaders have resisted that to date.
The revenue provision is important 
—not only in responding to White House 
concerns that the benefits bill be paid 
for — but because it could serve as the 
vehicle for other tax initiatives.
“The votes are there for the tax title,” 
Downey said. “The leadership is in­
clined to support the effort to pay.” 
That means it is likely the Senate 
will have the opportunity, should
Bentsen and others choose to seize it, to 
use unemployment benefits for larger 
political goals.
Such a marriage of convenience is 
just what many in both parties have 
been arguing for. The most outspoken 
proponent of the idea has been Housing 
Secretary Jack Kemp, who is urging 
Bush to embrace the idea.
“There’s no question taxes now co'ine 
into play,” Downey said. “My guess is, if 
you send over a tax title, we’re talking 
about everything.” Everything, as 
Downey said, means both tax cuts for 
the middle class and capital gains.
The prospect that such an exercise 
could be brought to a conclusion by 
Thanksgiving — the target date for 
adjournment this year — seems very 
unlikely. But then, just days ago, few 
pundits thought tax fever would seize 
the Capital as it has.
Rostenkowski, after meeting with 
Foley Tuesday, said he will introduce 
his own plan in the next week or so. The 
reluctant chairman will undoubtedly 
come under even more pressure to act 
Thursday when he caucuses with Demo­
crats on his committee.
Book reopens Iran-Contra
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21, (DJ) — Oliver North has 
rekindled debate about the Iran-Contra scandal with a 
fresh assertion that former President Reagan knew “ev­
erything,” but he offers little new evidence to buttress 
that allegation.
North, the former National Security Council staffer 
who was at the heart of the scandal, makes the assertion 
in a book that is being released this week. He claims that 
he was implicitly and explicitly pressured by superiors 
and Reagan supporters to exonerate the former president 
from blame in the scandal, in which funds from secret 
arms sales to Iran were diverted to support Contra rebels 
in Nicaragua at a time when U.S. aid to the rebels was 
banned.
The book also discloses the existence of a phone conver­
sation, accidentally taped by a private bank’s automatic 
recording system, in which two men seem to discuss 
President Reagan’s knowledge of the affair. In that con­
versation, one speaker, indicating he has just testified 
before the congressional committees investigating the 
scandal, declares that “Reagan knows. Reagan has all the 
memos.” But North claims that the identities of the two 
men in the recorded conversation couldn’t be clearly 
established and that the recording couldn’t be used in 
court.
But excerpts of the book released last weekend by Time 
magazine, which published them last week, don’t disclose 
further evidence of direct presidential knowledge beyond 
what North previously discussed in his own testimony 
before the congressional committees in July 1987.
At that time, North said, “I thought that I had received 
authority from the president” for the diversion of funds to
the Contras. And he disclosed that he had written five 
different memos in 1986 seeking presidential approval.
In the book, North declares, “And now, five years later,
I am even more convinced: President Reagan knew every­
thing. Ronald Reagan knew of and approved a great deal 
of what went on with both the Iranian initiative and 
private efforts on behalf of the Contras ... I have no doubt 
that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras, 
and that he approved it. Enthusiastically.” “Residuals” is 
the term North used — rather than “diversion” — to 
describe the money from Iranian arms sales that was sent 
to the Contras.
The main difference between North’s testimony in 1987 
and his account in the book, called Under Fire, seems to be 
a sharp decline in his willingness to give Reagan a clear 
opening to deny detailed knowledge.
No one could be reached for comment at Reagan’s office 
in California.
In his congressional testimony, North stressed repeat­
edly that he had no indication that any of his memos on the 
diversion of funds ever reached Reagan and that none ever 
was returned with an indication of approval by the presi­
dent. “I want to make it very clear that no memorandum 
ever came back to me with the president’s initials on it, or 
the president’s name on it, or a note from the president on 
it. None of these memoranda.”
But the book excerpts indicate that North feels badly 
served by the Reagan White House. He portrays himself as 
a scapegoat.
There isn’t any indication from the excerpts that his book 
further implicates President Bush, who was vice president 
at the time.
U.S. reins in nukes
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21, (DJ)—The 
Pentagon has decided to remove all 
nuclear weapons from South Korea af­
ter obtaining the Seoul government’s 
approval for the policy change, U.S. 
officials said.
The move, which reverses three de­
cades of U.S.-South Korean insistence 
that nuclear arms were an essential 
safeguard against North Korean ag­
gression, will take months to complete. 
But the decision is likely to pave the 
way for stepped up diplomatic pressure 
to get North Korea’s leaders to halt or 
curtail their nuclear weapons programs.
President Bush’s earlier arms-con- 
trol initiative called for destroying or
mothballing all land-based and sea- 
based nuclear arms, but left intact the 
U.S. arsenal of tactical nuclear arms in 
South Korea. After further discussion 
with Seoul, the White House ordered 
those arms to be included in the nuclear 
retrenchment.
An administration official said the 
Persian Gulf war has shown that the 
U.S. arsenal of sophisticated conven­
tional weapons would be sufficient to 
defend South Korea without resorting 
to nuclear weapons. The official also 
noted that “the nuclear umbrella is still 
there,” meaning that the U.S. has B-52 
bombers armed with nuclear bombs in 
the region.
Hostage Turner free
BEIRUT, Lebanon, Oct. 22, (DJ)
— American hostage Jesse Turner 
was freed into the hands of a U.N. 
official and taken to Syria, United 
Nations and other officials said. 
Sources in Damascus who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said Turner 
arrived in the Syrian capital early 
Tuesday, escorted by Syrian secu­
rity men.
In a statement, U.N. Secretary- 
General Javier Perez de Cuellar
thanked “groups in Lebanon” and 
the governments of Iran, Libya and 
Syria for helping to bring about the 
release of Turner.

Also all commitments by the 
prior administration to pro­
grams and faculty were honored.
New programs and initiatives 
have started in the Math De­
partment, Chemistry Depart­
ment, Modern Languages De­
partment, Biology Department, 
and other undergraduate pro­
grams.
Mehrabian then showed the 
audience some tables on the 
growth of the CMU community.
In 1981, there were 419 faculty, 
1246 staff and 1241 graduate 
students.
Currently, 
the number of 
faculty is 550, 
thestaff2402, 
and graduate 
students now 
number 2173.
This, accord- ___________________
t0Mehrabian,
puts great pressure on building 
to compensate for the lack of
space.
The University’s money, 
Mehrabian said, comes from the 
following categories: research, 
tuition, endowment, gifts and 
grants, auxiliary services, and 
other sources. In the past 10 
years, the intake from research 
and tuition has gone up a few 
percentage points, but there has 
been a fairly large loss of the 
gifts and grants as well as the 
endowments. Mehrabian then 
explained what is done with the 
money. The tuition money goes 
into the University programs, 
other money goes into research, 
capital projects, and other 
projects.
Comparatively, CMLFs com­
petition gets 21 percent less 
through its tuition, but it re­
ceives more money from gifts, 
grants, and endowments.
He said that the endowment 
at CMU is half of today’s compe­
tition (Northwestern, Rochester, 
Chicago, RPI, and Washington), 
and only a fourth of tomorrow’s 
competition (Penn, Cornell, MIT, 
Stanford, and Princeton).
CMU underestimated the 
amount of money it should re­
ceive from the government for 
research in 1987 by $10 million. 
The government and the Uni-
"It's a rapidly changing world and we 
have to participate [in this change].” 
— Robert Mehrabian, 
University President
versity have reached an agree­
ment as to how the government 
will pay the money it owes CMU. 
Mehrabian hopes the debt will 
be eliminated by 1992.
With the resolution of the debt, 
the faculty will receive the raises 
that were implemented earlier. 
By November they will get their 
raised paychecks, and the De­
cember checks will include all 
the pay that wasn’t implemented 
in the preceding months.
Mehrabian then mentioned 
that the University will reinsti­
tute parking increases by Janu­
ary. Anew, larger parking com­
plex was built, and it has to be 
paid for. “We can not allow the 
parking to affect our academic 
programs,” said Mehrabian.
“The Carnegie Plan,” accord­
ing to Mehrabian, will empha­
size the undergraduate pro­
grams. Expansion of under­
graduate research, focus on in­
struction, learning, and prob­
lem solving, promotion of the 
learning done outside the class­
room, expansion of the Univer­
sity Teaching Center, improve­
ment of student advising, and 
enhancement of cultural activi­
ties are some of the projects 
being worked on.
He also stated that minor­
ities are under-represented at 
CMU and that the general qual­
ity of the en­
rolled stu­
dent will im­
prove.
Mehrabian 
pointed out 
the future di­
rections of the 
University.
¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ CMU will in­
crease its 
partnerships with industries. 
According to Mehrabian, Carn­
egie Mellon University already 
ranks in the top three in this 
category. He also called for bet­
ter interaction among the seven 
colleges of CMU. There will be 
an enhancement of the re­
sources available. Strategic 
plans will help CMU meet its 
vision and fulfill its mission.
“We are going to focus on mak­
ing CMU a first rank university 
by building on our uniqueness.... 
We have to change with our 
environment.... We will focus 
on a CMU solution to the chal­
lenges that face us, without 
imitating other colleges. It will 
be the other way around,” said 
Mehrabian. “I think we’re in 
good shape.”

the phone is answered. The vic­
tims kept a log of the calls and 
had received 32 calls in less than 
24 hours. While the responding 
officer was there, they received 
another call. The victims were 
advised to contact the Police 
again on Monday if the calls 
persisted and to continue the 
log.
10/21 FIRE ALARM, 9:59 
pm. The fire alarm in an off- 
campus apartment building 
went off due to burnt food. Only 
four residents evacuated the

in the building. The alarm was 
reset.

The complainant reported that 
someone was walking on the
ledge outside of the fifth-floor 
lounge in Resnick. Reponding

stated that he was an architec­
ture student and he was on the 
ledge so he could get a better 
look at the building’s design. He 
also said that he did not realize 
that he was violating any rules 
by walking on the ledge. He was 
issued an internal citation.
10/24 SUSPICIOUS PER­

TO DISCUSS THE
EPFL EXCHANGE PROGRAM
i n
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND
5:00 pm, Wednesday, October 30, 1991 
Sorry, the meeting is in DH 1112 not Switzerland!
The Ecole Polytechmque Federale de Lausanne has excellent programs 
which match most of our majors in CIT and MCS. Our exchange program 
with EPFL is 15 years old, and over 120 CMU students have participated. 
Students on the program get full credit towards graduation and keep all of 
their normal financial aid except work study funds. However, there are 
opportunities to work while in Switzerland.
Requirements: If your QPA is around 3.0, you do not need any prior 
French language training. HALF OF THE RECENT CMU EXCHANGE 
STUDENTS HAD NEVER STUDED FRENCH PRIOR TO THIS PRO­
GRAM. Most students attend a free, 12-week language training course in 
Switzerland. This course starts in July, and courses at EPFL start in Octo­
ber Below a 2.9 QPA, we would expect you to have some previous 
French training in either college or high school.

Scientist denies 
weapons charges
ALLEGATIONS, from page 1
Carnegie Mellon University 
researchers were leaders of 
three project groups at the 
meeting.
Thorpe denies Shell’s 
claims. “All the [research] we 
do... is dual purpose. Thereis 
no direct weapons research. 
The work has civilian uses,” 
said Thorpe. Carnegie Mel­
lon University does not work 
on classified projects because 
of the foreign nationals in the 
departments and because 
that kind of research does 
notfittheUniversity, accord­
ing to Thorpe.
Thorpe also said that he 
was not aware that Shell was 
planning a press conference 
and that a press conference 
was not the right way to start 
a dialogue on the subject. “I’m
not too impressed with 
[Shell’s] claims,” said Thorpe.
Three other Carnegie Mel­
lon University professors, 
Lincoln Wolfenstein from the 
Physics Department, Ravi 
Kannanof the School ofCom- 
puter Science, and David 
Demarest of the English De­
partment, have analyzed the 
document and support Shell’s 
reaction to the document.
The University has not 
made an official response to 
Shell’s allegations.
“I’m willing to speak out 
and lose my job because no 
one else is willing to. Many 
people will be angiy,” said 
Shell. “Everyone has the free­
dom of speech. If this depart­
ment doesn’t tolerate free 
speech I wouldn’t want to 
work here.”

PARKING, from page 1
“cost accounting methodology,” 
frozen salary increases will be 
reinstated, and employees will 
receive a separate payment for 
lost wages during- the three- 
month period. Accordingly, 
planned parking rate increases 
will be implemented beginning 
January 1,1992.
The result is that yearly rates 
for all 17 campus parking areas 
will go up by varying degrees, 
with the largest increase for the 
permits for the Tech Field Ga­
rage parking lot going up 29 
percent to $452.
According to Steve Schillow, 
associate vice president for Busi­
ness Affairs and University 
Planning, the University based 
the increases on a model of sup­
ply and demand, issuing the 
highest rates to the more attrac­
tive and convenient lots. He 
says the rationale behind the 
large increase in the Tech Field 
Garage rates was the attractive­
ness of features such as covered 
parking and a 24-hour security 
attendant. Other lots, he said, 
were increased based on their 
proximity to various campus 
workplaces.
The Baker Hall lot will now 
become the most expensive area, 
with rates going up next semes­
ter by 20 percent to $793. The 
second highest rate goes to the 
Fine Arts lot at $786, while 
Warner Hall comes in a close 
third at $779. On the other end 
of the spectrum, Doherty Apart­
ments area permits are the low­
est rate at $323. People who use 
the fraternity and sorority park­
ing lots also get a special break, 
with a rate of $337 for both the
Quad parking lot and the soror­
ity parking area behind Donner 
Hall. The average (unweighted) 
rate for all lots for the 1991- 
1992 year is $495.
Like Housing and Dining Ser­
vice, the Carnegie Mellon Park­
ing Office is largely a separate 
entity from the University 
proper. “Parking is an auxiliary 
service that needs to cover it’s 
costs,” said Schillow. “The uni­
versity is not in a position to 
subsidize parking, nor is it tak­
ing any kind of a return from the 
parking operation. The rates are
what they have to be.”
Like the rest of the Univer­
sity, however, the Parking Of­
fice is in debt — to the tune of 
approximately $590,000 per year 
for the next 13 years, due to an 
internal loan obtained from the 
University to construct the Tech 
Field Garage.
As a result, Parking Coordi­
nator Sylvia Austin said she ex­
pects parkingrates will continue 
the pattern of yearly increases 
in the foreseeable future. “After 
all,” she said, “they have to pay 
for this beautiful garage that’s 
been in the hole ever since it was 
built.” Additionally, Austin says 
her office is plagued by high op­
erating costs, such as a tax on 
permits issued to non-city resi­
dents that amounts to some
$200,000 per year.
Still, Schillow says collabora­
tion between Carnegie Mellon 
University and the Parking Of­
fice makes for what he sees as a 
sound system. “I think we ap­
preciate our employees’ and stu­
dents’ concerns about parking 
rates,” says Schillow. “When we 
review them, compared to the 
cost of parking in Oakland and 
to the cost of Port Authority Bus 
passes, we think they’re com­
petitive rates.”
Austin agrees, stressing that 
all of those students who ap­
plied for an on-campus parking 
permit this year were calledback 
with an offer. “Every student 
who wanted one got one,” said 
Austin. Currently, there are 467 
students paying for on-campus 
parking.
While no figures were avail­
able at press time for the num­
ber of students parking off-cam- 
pus, it’s likely to be lower after 
new city parking restrictions 
take effect.
According to Richard Meritzer, 
a senior planner with the Resi­
dential Permit Parking Program 
at the Department of City Plan­
ning, the resident permit park­
ing area K — Squirrel Hill — 
will soon be expanded. Affected 
streets are all of North­
umberland from Forbes to
Wightman, all of Squirrel Hill 
from Northumberland to Fair 
Oaks, portions of Bennington, 
Invamess, and Maynard, and 
additional portions of Plainfield. 
While no precise starting time is 
slated, Meritzer said the signs 
should be up, and enforcement 
should begin sometime before 
Thanksgiving.
Schillow says the University 
considers the City of Pittsburgh’s 
measures in Squirrel Hill to be 
reasonable. “The University ap­
preciates the concern of our 
neighbors with students and 
staff parking on the streets,” said 
Schillow. “We think that there’s 
adequate parking available on 
campus, and for that reason we 
support the extension of the per­
mit parking program to address 
their concerns.”
When asked whether the cur­
rent campus parking system can 
handle a possible influx of stu­
dents due to the new restric­
tions off-campus, Schillow says 
he doesn’t perceive any new 
problem. “I believe that some 
additional permits can be made 
available, but the University has 
discouraged and will continue 
to discourage students who live 
on campus from bringing cars to 
school,” he said. “Furthermore, 
if you live in any of the apart­
ment buildings over in 
Shadyside, we run the shuttle 
program to try to address those 
needs.”
“We’ll do our best to provide as 
much parking as can be pro­
vided, but in the final analysis 
we discourage students — espe­
cially those who are living on 
campus — from bringing cars to 
school,” said Schillow.

keley campus its reputation for 
liberalism. “I was a product of 
that time,” said Henry. “Most 
people who lived through that 
time were affected by it in one 
way or another.” After receiving 
her doctorate in genetics in 1971, 
Henry did post-doctoral work in 
molecular biology at Brandeis 
University in Massachusetts for 
a year.
In 1972 Henry took her first 
faculty position at the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in 
New York as an assistant pro­
fessor of genetics and molecular 
biology. After working her way 
up through professorship and' 
becoming head of graduate stud- - 
ies, Henry was approached by 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
faculty committee. In 1987 she 
arrived at CMU to be depart­
ment head and professor of bio­
logical science. She spent four 
years in that job before accept­
ing the position of dean.

an outstanding idea: Educate 
the campus community about 
different cultures.
However, there were some prob­
lems translating the idea into ac­
tion. The topic of Asia was too 
broad, the content of the festival 
was disappointing, and the whole 
thing was poorly publicized.
Asia is far too large to be cov­
ered adequately in one week. 
There is no single culture of Asia
— it contains a variety which 
were just glossed over instead of 
given the in-depth coverage that 
was expected. A better idea 
might have been to cover a 
smaller area, like the Middle 
East, Far East, or Southeast 
Asia. This would have allowed 
the International Festival to fo­
cus on fewer culture and truly 
explore them. Aweek-longfesti- 
val can’t do justice to all the 
cultures on a continent.
While the speakers, lecturers, 
and films scheduled early in the 
week were generally entertain­
ing, they were largely not inter­
active and, on the schedule, did 
not appear fun. Therefore, they 
did not attract large crowds.
In addition, most of the events 
were inside and were easy to 
miss unless you walk through 
the Skibo every day. If some of 
those events were held outdoors, 
such as the booth fair or bazaar, 
they would have attracted more 
attention and interest, even if 
from casual passers-by.
The weekday events were poorly 
scheduled. Many ofthem occurred 
during class hours, and people did
Student Senate has decided 
not to guarantee reimbursement 
if tools used by student organi­
zations are stolen. Students who 
lend tools to their organization 
will have to take the risk that if 
their tools are stolen, they will 
not receive any payment for re­
placement costs.
Student Senate has not thor­
oughly thought through the 
ramifications of such a policy. 
Student organizations depend 
on members to lend them tools. 
Without a guarantee of replace­
ment, students willbevery wary 
about lending their personal 
tools. Ultimately, the organiza­
tions will need to seek out addi­
tional funds from Student Sen­
ate to buy the tools they once 
borrowed from their members. 
This introduces a greater ex­
pense to Senate than infrequent 
replacement would.
Although we believe that Sen­
ate had the right intent, in the 
long run the solution will cost 
Senate more money in special 
allocations. There needs to be a 
system developed that protects 
students who lend tools, but does 
not obligate Senate to replace 
every tool lost or stolen from 
student organizations.
We suggest a system that 
places a combined responsibil­
ity of reimbursement on Senate 
and student organizations them­
selves. Senate would put up 60 
percent of the replacement cost,
not want to miss classes unless 
they were sure they would enjoy 
the program. The result is that 
people went to activities related to 
things they already knew about. 
The people who could have learned 
somethingnew about an unfamil­
iar culture went to class. In the 
future, programs shouldbe sched­
uled during University free hours 
or in the evening.
The festival itself was poorly 
scheduled. It fell very close to 
mid-terms and with all of the 
extra coursework pressures, 
many students simply did not 
schedule the time to spend away 
from their studies.
The publicity for the Interna­
tional Festival was inadequate. 
Even after the posters and pam­
phlets, some students remained 
unaware that the festival was 
taking place, or confused about 
what it was.
Future International Festivals 
should be organized like Carni­
val, with a relatively fixed date, 
and a day off of classes to encour­
age student participation.
While the outcome of this 
year’s International Festival 
was less than spectacular, it has 
the potential to become a wel­
come and well-attended tradi­
tion on campus. However, the 
planning efforts need to be re­
fined. The festival needs a more 
specific focus, better event plan­
ning, and better and more fo­
cused publicity. International 
Festival should be a chance to 
truly learn about a foreign cul­
ture, not just another low-pro- 
file, low-turnout event at CMU.
but only if the organization that 
had the tool stolen agrees to 
reimburse the owner of the tool 
for the other 40 percent. This 
financial obligation would en­
sure that organizations would 
be even more careful to protect 
the tools that they borrow.
In addition, organizations 
would be eligible for this reim­
bursement only once every two 
years. Tools with a value of $30 
or less would be excluded from 
this system and the student or­
ganization would be responsible 
for replacement costs. This pre­
vents Senate from being respon­
sible for the relatively small, 
easily lost or stolen tools, and 
also keeps organizations from 
shouldering the entire burden 
of replacing expensive items. 
Any tool that an organization 
borrows would have to be for­
mally registered with Senate for 
it to be eligible for reimburse­
ment. These stipulations would 
protect Senate from misuse or 
fraud.
We would like to see Senate 
implement a system similar to 
protect the interests of organi­
zations, students, and Senate. 
We don’t want to see Senate 
regularly paying out large sums 
of the Activities Fee to replace 
tools, but we also don’t want to 
see student organizations lack­
ing necessary tools. A set of 
sound guidelines will protect 
everyone’s interests.
AFL suggests viewing 
issue from all sides
Editor:
The pro-life move­
ment is dedicated to 
raising the public 
consciousness of the 
value of human life. While this engulfs 
many issues, abortion is one which has 
gained the pro-life movement notori­
ety. It is our firm belief that an unborn 
child is as valuable as any other human 
life.
The pro-life movement is made up of 
a diverse group of individuals. A1989 
Boston Globe/WBZ survey concluded 
that “there was virtually no difference” 
between men and women regarding 
abortion. National Right To Life (NRL), 
headed by Wanda Franz, is the largest 
pro-life group in the world, with mem­
bership from over 50 countries from all 
walks of life. With 600,000 members 
(twice the membership of NOW), Con­
cerned Women Of America, is the larg­
est women’s group in the US and is pro­
life. There are many other pro-life 
groups, such as Feminists For Life, The 
Professional Women’s Network, and 
numerous others. The CMU Associa­
tion For Life’s membership comes from 
all aspects of the CMU community and 
is about 50% female. Please note that 
these groups are neither religiously 
based nor affiliated.
Lately, a pro-life group, Operation 
Rescue, has been given much media 
attention. Operation Rescue is non-vio- 
lent and believes that the best way to 
change abortion laws is by civil disobe­
dience - the same way blacks gained 
civil rights.
Wanda Franz was recently quoted in 
Scientist as saying “NRL is not against 
research on RU486 for non-abortion 
purposes.” However, the American 
Medical Association characterized 
claims about non-abortion uses for 
RU486 as “published conjecture.” 
Roussel-Oclaf (the makers of RU486) 
has not even released the drug to the 
FDA to test it’s safety and effective­
ness.
In last week’s Tartan Rich Robinson 
wrote a column in which he seemed to 
be misinformed about the pro-life move­
ment [“Abortion battle pits religion 
against rights,” 10/21]. Robinson’s ar­
ticle may seem convincing to someone 
who is not involved in the issue. In fact, 
it might even be convincing for those in 
the issue who, like Robinson, do not 
know all the facts. Before anyone makes 
a conscious decision on abortion, we 
strongly encourage him or her to learn 
the facts—from both sides of the issue.
CMU Association For Life
CMU alumnus applauds 
cmuOUT’s publication
Editor:
The first issue of 
cmuOUT’s Lambda 
Alums was the most 
valuable piece of mail 
I have received from 
CMU in the 11 years since completing 
my MFA in directing. CMITs develop­
ment office is relentless in sending pro­
paganda which ignores the multitude 
of openly lesbian and gay students and
alumni. Queer money is dirty money at 
CMU; bad economic planning if you ask 
me.
I spent the last pre-AIDS years at 
CMU(1977-1980) and although the gay/ 
lesbian social scene was terrific, those 
of us who were openly gay were treated 
coldly and with hostility by some mem­
bers of the drama faculty, administra­
tion and student body of the drama 
department.
The drama department in those years 
seemed to pride itself on its “straight 
white male” image. This was partially 
derived from the discomfort that so 
many heterosexual drama students felt 
at being harassed by gaybashers who, 
because of their bias, assumed errone­
ously that “all dramats are fags.” The 
few women directing students who were 
lesbian operated under the unrelent­
ing double disadvantage of being both 
female and lesbian.
The department head at the time was 
aggressively heterosexual and his pre­
decessor had left behind a group of 
directing students more noted for their 
heterosexuality than theirtalent. (Then- 
current careers bear this out.) Hetero­
sexual values were rewarded under this 
system and students whose work or life 
reflected a “queer sensibility” were at a 
serious disadvantage.
It has taken me ten years of personal 
and political growth to realize that sev­
eral inexplicably negative encounters 
of some gay and lesbian students had to 
do with their sexual orientation, al­
though like other forms of sexual ha­
rassment and discrimination these in­
cidence were difficult to corroborate.
To the straight students and faculty, 
we represented the dreaded negative 
stereotype of the theater student. Dis­
creet queers were “tolerated.” Plum 
acting roles and directing assignments 
went to students perceived (often erro­
neously) as being heterosexual. Of 
course, there were exceptions. But for 
the most part, openly gay and lesbian 
students got leftovers.
I am thrilled that today’s lesbians 
and gays are refusing to be merely 
tolerated at CMU and are beginning to 
use their collective clout to demand 
their share of respect and power. And 
to the rest of CMU let me just say 
“We’re here, we’re Queer, don’t under­
estimate us.”

Staff member corrects 
quotes, misconceptions
Editor:
Mike Kunsmann 
attempted to quote 
several speakers in 
The Tartan’s article 
about National Com­
ing Out Day [“National Coming Out 
Day observed,” 10/21]. My name was 
incorrectly given as Jane Hardy, and 
several of my phrases were attached to 
other phrases and sentences to form a 
very incoherent misquote.
Kunsmann quotes me as saying, “I 
came out in 1975 and still my relation­
ship is not taken seriously. How do you 
argue with “die fag?’” What I actually 
said was: “My name is Jan Hardy, and 
I came out in 1975. I’ve been loving 
women longer than some of the stu­
dents here have been able to read, and 
yet they think they have the authority 
to judge me. I’ve been with my lover 
longer than many heterosexuals have 
been together, yet my relationship isn’t 
taken seriously. I read an article in the 
Pitt News describing an incident of ha­
rassment — a College Republican giv­
ing his brilliant political thesis to two 
members of Pitt’s BiGala: T>ie fag.’ How 
do you argue with ‘die fag?”’
The article goes on to quote me as 
saying “laws, religions, the fear of los­
ing friends and family support are some 
of the reasons for this tremendous op­
pression of emotions. She also said that 
there are more homosexuals than people 
realize, and a lot of the hardship of 
coming out could be prevented if their 
fears could be reduced. She said some 
ways the campus can help reduce fears 
are to resist calling people derogatory 
names for their sexual preferences and 
to leave cmuOUT posters hanging. She 
encouraged everyone to show their sup­
port so that people who are homosexual 
can more easily confront the terror of 
realization.”
I want to make it clear that I said 
none of the things in the above mis­
quote at the rally or at any other time. 
These sentences were probably bits and 
pieces of opinions voiced by other speak­
ers. I especially do not want to take 
credit for using the term “homosexual” 
for gays andlesbians, since our identity 
involves more than our sexuality. I also 
take issue with the phrase “the terror of 
realization.” For me, realization was a 
relief, not a terror.
I appreciate The Tartan’s effort to 
cover this important event, but I urge 
Mr. Kunsmann to take greater care in 
his reporting.

Issue of gym facilities 
ties into quality of life
Editor:
I’m encouraged to 
see some rallying on 
campus to address a 
basic quality-of-life 
issue, namely the 
state of CMU’s ath­

When I read that Dining Service was 
going to be roughly $200,000 in debt, I 
almost went through the roof. I went 
around to all my friends saying, “What did 
I say? What did I say?” I instantly decided 
that maybe we should start docking Jim 
Gurley’s pay until the debt was paid off. 
ffell, the more rational of my friends said, 
"Chris, why don’t you talk to Jim himself 
and see what’s up?” I did.
I sat down with Jim Gurley and Roger 
Heydt last Thursday to see exactly what 
happened. In short, the students are giv­
ing CMDS a hard time with the meal plan. 
Over the past five years, the number of 
students on the meal plan has been declin­
ing. However, the percentage of meals 
used has been going up. In the past stu­
dents have used around 80 percent of their 
meals. Now, the percentage is in the upper 
80s. Additionally, people are taking their 
business to the Kiltie Court. That trend is 
drawing people away from places like the 
Highlander Cafe.
“So what?” you say. I can go anywhere I 
want to eat. Well, that’s true. But you see, 
the cash allotment idea was originally 
designed to be used for snacks. It was 
created for those who might have missed
a meal because of classes or other activi­
ties. Today, roughly two thirds of stu­
dents use the cash allotment. Since the 
price per board student for food is higher 
at the Kil tie Court, and students eat there 
more often, CMDS is in sort of a bind.
As a result, the Highlander Cafe is 
under efficiency. It’s designed to serve 
almost one thousand students every meal. 
Now, it’s only serving about 600 max. In 
short, the Highlander Cafe is a cost which 
is not paying for itself. CMDS has the 
people, the resources, and the food, but no 
one to buy and eat it.
So, what is to be done? Well, CMDS 
printed a survey in The Tartan to solicit 
student opinion. And for the first time, 
I’m going to put some blame on the gen­
eral student body. Only 50responses came 
in. People complain about CMDS, but no 
one wants to do anything about it. Both 
CMDS and SDC had to go table to table to 
get survey results. Now they have about 
300-400 survey s to help decide on a course 
of action.
And what about the Highlander? Why 
is it under efficiency? Why do more people 
choose to go to the Kiltie Court? The 
answer is simple. A good number of stu­
dents think that the food at Highlander is 
terrible. I don’t blame them. As someone 
who’s tasted the institutionalized food of 
the U.S. Navy, I can tell you that no place 
as big as the Highlander Cafe is going to 
make food like mom’s good ole home
cookin’. But why can’t it be like the food at 
Morewood Gardens? That is a general 
complaint among those who eat at 
Morewood frequently. I think that if the 
quality of food at Highlander were in­
creased, CMDS could win people back to 
the meal plan. Ah, yes, you say. That 
would work. But what about these sug­
gestions I read about raising the price of 
a meal plan, closing Morewood Gardens 
for certain periods, restricting Domino’s, 
and lowering the cash allotment?
Heydt said that he felt if the price were 
raised significantly, they would lose a 
great deal more students than they al­
ready have. Of course, it is a given that 
students would be most upset if the use of 
Domino’s was restricted or cut. Well, do 
you remember that little idea about going 
to a Validine system? Gurley and Heydt 
said they were considering the use of 
something called “Board Plus” or “Flex.” 
Under this system, students would buy a 
meal plan of, say, nine meals. The rest of 
the system would consist of a “pseudo- 
Validine” with a declining balance of some­
thing like $500. With this structure, stu­
dents could still “pay-as-they-go”. In other 
words, students could actually control the 
amount of money they spend on food. No 
longer would we end up with five unused 
meals at the end of the week.
This plan might actually work. Remem­
ber that people buy opportunities to eat, not 
actual meals. However, once people get here, 
only then do they figure out how many 
meals on the average they are going to eat 
in one week. This is especially true for 
freshmen. With this new “Board Plus” sys­
tem, students will have a little more flexibil­
ity. They also won’t end up paying for a 19- 
meal plan when they only eat about 15 
meals a week. I guess docking Gurley’s pay 
wasn’t such a good idea after all. Hopefully, 
CMDS can come up with a workable solu­
tion that will save them financially and give 
us some goodfood. Andifyou don’t like what 
they’re doing, do what I did. Go talk to them. 
They’ll be more than happy to listen.

Selective incapacitation amazes student
AbbySchiff
Picture the scene: a harrowing mid­
term exam. Students were dropping like 
flies. Blue books were scattered every­
where. There I sat, with furrowed brow, 
trying desperately to remember a par­
ticular scholarly term for use in my an­
swer to Essay Question Two. The min­
utes ticked away. I remembered reading 
about it. I remembered studying it, even 
if only off a crumpled sheet of loose leaf as 
I ran to class late, tripping over my own 
shoelaces. The silence was as deafening 
as the music from my downstairs 
neighbor’s stereo had been the night be­
fore, when I was trying to read something 
that I should have had covered seven 
weeks ago when it was assigned. But 
nothing came to mind; it was as if I had
never come across this term in all my 
hours (okay, hour) of diligent reading.
So I did the only thing I could in such a 
situation—rationalized my incomplete re­
sponse with an internal, self-reassuring: Oh, 
the professor won’t notice. The rest of my 
answer is, after all, flawless. Clinging to this 
outright lie like a barnacle to the slimy 
bottom of a rowboat, I finished my exam and 
left.
As soon as the classroom door had closed 
behind me, the term—selective incapacita­
tion — popped effortlessly into my mind. I 
suppose that this is one of those moments 
when normal people burst out laughing at 
the irony of a situation and file it away under 
~/coUege/dumbstories/grandchildren. Re­
member, though, that Fve been here at CMU 
for all of two months and the effect that the 
place has had on me is, well... definitely not 
normal. So instead of pondering the deli­
ciously secret wonders of the human brain, I 
cackled giddily to myself and kicked a few

Insurance deters killings
Jeff Basista
Dr. Kevorkian’s suicide ma­
chine has been in the news quite 
a bit lately, and it’s prompted 
me to worry about how people 
suffering from temporary prob­
lems may carry out successful 
suicides if efficient means are 
available. I don’t know anyone 
who is terminally ill, but I’ve 
seen many suicide attempts in 
the past few days. Fortunately, 
most of these people chose “sui­
cide by traffic” as their means; 
although this is certainly an ef­
ficient method, our auto insur­
ance rate structure guarantees 
that nearly all of these attempts 
will prove unsuccessful.
For instance, on Thursday 
night, a friend and I were walk­
ing back to a parking garage 
after the hockey game. While we 
were standing on a comer wait­
ing for the flashing “WALK” sign, 
a very large group of pedestri­
ans walked toward a group of 
cars that was starting to move 
— the light for the cars had just 
turned green. The cars all 
stopped, and this puzzled my 
friend. She wondered why the 
cars, who had the green light, 
didn’t just keep going and run 
down the pedestrians. We as­
sumed that all of them had the 
intellect required to read the 
flashing signs, and they must 
have known the difference be­
tween red and green. Their deci­
sion to walk toward the cars 
must have been purposeful. My 
friend and I decided that the 
hockey game — in which the
Penguins played pathetically— 
had driven these people into de­
spair, a despair so serious that it 
prompted a mass suicide at­
tempt.
One botched hockey game cer­
tainly doesn’t justify a suicide 
attempt, even if the victors hap­
pen to be the New Jersey Devils. 
Still, these people tried hard to 
be run down, but the cars would 
not cooperate. After talking it 
over for a while, my friend and I 
decided that only one thingfoiled 
the suicide attempt: the motor­
ists knew that their insurance 
rates would skyrocket if they 
were to injure or kill the pedes­
trians.
The thought of skyrocketing 
insurance rates crossed my mind 
the next day as I was driving 
into the Skibo lot. Up ahead, I 
noticed a couple of students

structure. It was less clear at 
that time whether the campus 
community was willing to con­
tribute to a solution, given the 
prevalent mindset that the fu­
ture University Center would 
be a panacea.
The Athletic Facilities Advi­
sory Board, newly established 
by committees of Student Sen­
ate and the Graduate Student 
Organization, has attracted 
some much-needed attention to 
the existing facility. This com­
mittee will enable users to join 
with the Athletics Department 
and Student Affairs in making 
the gym a healthier, safer, and 
more comfortable place. Given 
the cooperation of all, and given 
full information about what re­
sources the administration is 
willing to commit to the en- 
deavor, the committee has great 
potential to effect some progress. 
Best of luck to Senate’s Matt 
Shevach, who has enthusiasti-
cally embraced the chairman­
ship, and to the committee as a 
whole as it falls into place.

Shin comments on 
activities, programs
Editor:o%
I would like 
to take this op­
portunity to 
address and 
comment on a 
few pertinent issues this week.
First, I thank those of you who 
participated in the International 
Festival. It was a perfect oppor­
tunity to broaden our cultural 
understanding and to have fun. 
I would also like to recognize all 
the people, in particular Aliya 
Khan and Lisa Schmidt, who 
made the International Festival

a reality. Your hard work and 
dedication were evident in all 
that happened during the last 
week.
I also would like to comment 
on the Commission on Under­
graduate Education. The Com­
mission, conceptualized by 
President Mehrabian and 
chaired by Vice-Provost 
Steinberg, will conduct a com­
prehensive study of Carnegie 
Mellon’s current undergraduate 
education. The administration 
has demonstrated its commit­
ment to enhance Carnegie 
Mellon’s undergraduate educa­
tion, both in and out of the class­
room. To ensure the optimal 
results of the Commission’s en­
deavors, we, the students, must 
respond to their commitment 
with an equal level of enthusi­
asm and willingness.
The Commission has created 
10 initial task forces to analyze 
such important issues as stu­
dent advising, attention to teach­
ing, and technology in support 
of education. Each task force will 
include student representatives. 
I would value your comments 
and feedback on the Commis­
sion.
Student Government has be­
gun planning for the Depart­
mental Information Fair. This 
initiative, co-chaired by students 
Michael Ewedosh andMissy Van 
Eoyen, will take place in Febru­
ary and hopes to further stu­
dents’ understanding of various 
academic options available on 
campus, whether they be differ­
ent majors, courses, or special 
programs. Anyone interested in 
being involved in the planning 
of this program should contact 
Ewedosh or Van Royen.
The Student Mentor Program 
will have an interim evaluation 
session on November 11. The 
second Mentor newsletter and 
invitations should be mailed to 
the participants soon. In the 
meantime, please let Natalie
Gesmond or myself know of any 
comments, suggestions, or ques­
tions that you have.

The Tartan « Carnegie Mellon • 28 October 19919
This past week kicked off 
the first annual International 
Festival at Carnegie Mellon. 
A multitude of events, activi­
ties, and programs were spon­
sored and run to awaken stu­
dents’ interest in Asia. What 
did you think of Interna­
tional Festival?

small, helpless animals on my way back to

As it turns out, I did well on the exam. But 
Tm becoming increasingly suspicious that 
my memory has a malicious streak; for not 
only do I forget important items, I remember 
things even when Id rather forget them. As 
a rule, trifles like turning on my alarm dock 
the night before the SATs generally slip my 
mind Despite my worst efforts, however, I 
can still recall the careless mistake I made 
on Section 5 (math), the question I 
misgridded, and the vocabulary problem 
where I had it narrowed down to two

choices ... and guessed the wrong one.
The more I think about it, the more 
these mysteries of memory confound 
me. Why is it that I can (and unfortu­
nately often do) belt out a toneless ren­
dition of any song by Wham! or Air 
Supply that happens to come on the
radio, yet I draw a total blank when it 
comes time to answer an easy question 
on a final exam that will determine my 
grade? Ask me to recite verbatim the 
stinging speech of my sixth grade drama 
teacher as she yelled at me in front of the 
entire class and I’ll wow you with my old-
biddy impression as well as a photo­
graphic memory; but inquire as to what 
my philosophy professor said ten min­
utes ago and I’ll give you a stare as blank 
as the page in my notebook where I was 
supposed to be writing notes.
I suppose I shouldn’t worry about a 
phrase so insignificant that it won’t re­
ally make much of a difference in deter­
mining the course of my future, or, more 
importantly, my final class grade. We 
all have our academic regrets: I could 
have bought the required texts; I should 
have gone to the library instead of to the 
All You Can Chug Belch-A-Thon; I would
have attended class that month. Yet 
somehow a lower grade seems that much 
more tragic when I have the answer on the 
tip of my tongue and it just won’t come to 
me.
So where was selective incapacitation 
when I needed it? My best estimation is 
that it lay with all the forgotten birthdays, 
knowledge of turning off irons when leav­
ing the house, and where I put my keys 
whenl came home yesterday. Itwas buried 
under the chorus of a catchy mid-1980s 
Peter Cetera tune, fighting to be free.

walking away from the build­
ing; I thought that they were 
walking to the sidewalk, but 
strangely, as I approached, they 
kept walking straight at me in- 
steadofheadingtowardthe side­
walk. I assumed that they 
wanted me to run them down, so 
I kept going. The looks on their 
faces held a bizarre combination 
of surprise and anger, and they 
quickly headed for the sidewalk. 
My guess is that they were up­
set because I didn’t speed up. If 
I had hit them, they almost cer­
tainly would not have died. I 
wasn’t going nearly fast enough.
My girlfriend, who watched 
this event, askedme why I hadn’t 
put these two out of their mis­
ery. I could have said that the 
two students may have failed a 
test, broken up with their girl­
friends, or had some other un­
pleasant experience that had 
caused a temporary death wish. 
I could have said that my con­
science would have bothered me 
if I would run over two people 
whose suffering would last only 
briefly.
But I had to admit the truth: 
I didn’t want my insurance rates 
to go up.
Insurance rates, then, are a
powerful force working against 
anyone who would try to end it 
all by wandering into traffic. If 
you become one of those de­
pressed students who cross 
Forbes Avenue every day against 
the light, please consider your 
suicide attempt carefully—even 
Carnegie Mellon misery goes 
away after a while. But if you 
are certain that you want to end 
it all, be sure to wait for a very 
expensive car: only a truly 
wealthy driver can afford to run 
you down.

SPORTS
All play, no 
work makes 
press Pass a 
dull column
Many times over the past 
year since I got this column on 
a regular basis, this space has 
transformed into something 
like MTV’s short-lived “Kevin 
Seal’s Sporting Fool.” You 
know — Jason plays IM 
hockey, Jason pushes a buggy, 
Jason attempts to wrestle an 
alligator — that sort of thing.
To pay tribute to the rich 
heritage of Press Pass, I 
present another chapter in 
that saga: Jason pretends he’s 
the CMU Sports Information 
Director.
The backdrop for this great 
experiment was the University 
Athletic Association cross 
country championships on 
Saturday. Since Bruce Gerson, 
the real SID, had to leave 
town, I was given a crash 
course in the basics of stats 
procurement and distribution 
and released into the world as 
a quasi-official member of the 
Athletic Department staff.
My mission was simple 
enough; get the official stand­
ings after each race, distribute 
copies to coaches and other 
concerned parties, and fax 
results to the schools and a 
few newspapers. Not exactly a 
grueling task, but I’ll put on 
my resumé that I survived an 
exhaustive candidate search to 
become the “Acting SID.” After 
all, it looked pretty good on the 
fax cover sheets, so why not 
try it on the grand scale?
Anyway, the major thing I 
learned from my experience is 
that being an SID requires a 
lot of standing around, yet one 
always wants to look busy in 
case anyone important is 
watching. I wasn’t quite able 
to master this talent; in fact, 
there were times that I rev­
elled in catching Z’s on the 
Porter Hall steps while every­
one else scuttled around, doing 
legitimate work.
Not that I didn’t do anything
— I just did it at different 
times. While everyone else was 
cooling down after the races, I 
was contemplating giving the 
copier a head-butt to keep it 
from streaking. I ended up 
rationalizing that Bruce 
Gerson probably wouldn’t do 
such a thing, so I lived with 
the streaks (and a few paper 
jams).
Besides, I had no desire to 
get slapped with a repair bill if 
Physical violence made the 
copier sicker, so I stuck with 
verbal abuse.
Furthermore, as the runners 
dispersed after the awards 
ceremony, I was off to work 
some more. I don’t know if the 
phrase “slaving over a hot fax 
machine” is really accurate, 
hut it felt that way. After a 
two-hour bout with the elec­
tronic age, I took off for home
— leaving an open office 
window and an accidentally- 
stolen ballpoint pen in my 
wake.
I’d like to think the experi­
ence expanded my horizons 
^d gave me a greater under­
standing of what goes on 
behind the scenes at an 
athletic event. At the very 
least, I learned what type of 
copier I don’t want to buy.

Can you say “blowout,” boys 
and girls?
The Tartans certainly can, af­
ter their 55-14 performance — 
a season high for points scored 
—against the College ofW ooster 
on Saturday. The Scots can say 
it, too — though they probably 
won’t want to talk about it too 
much — after being held to a 
pair of touchdowns and just 209 
total yards to the Tartans’ 510.
465 of CMlFs yards came on 
the ground, through the efforts 
of 14 different ball-carriers. 
“Right now I think our running 
attack is hitting on all cylin­
ders,” said offensive coordinator 
Rich Erdelyi. “We just had an 
excellent day running the foot­
ball.”
The Tartans averaged an im­
pressive 6.5 yards per play, con­
trolling the ball for nearly 35 
minutes. They scored on eight of 
their eleven possessions, which 
is, perhaps, the most impressive 
statistic of all.
Credit goes to the Tartan of­
fensive line, which paved the 
way. “Our offensive line had an 
outstanding day,” said junior 
fullback Griffin Pero, who ran 
for three of CMITs touchdowns. 
“The linemen were opening great 
holes, and we had our choice.” 
“We controlled the ball and 
did what we wanted to do,” added 
senior center Mike Lemansky. 
“We gave them a lot of the un­
balanced look this week, and it 
kept them off guard. They really 
didn’t adjust to it very well.” 
The Tartan defense deserves 
its share of credit as well, for 
intercepting a pass, forcing two 
fumbles, and sacking Wooster 
quarterbacks three times. They 
recovered quickly after giving
up an early touchdown, limiting 
Wooster quarterback Vic 
Rowcliffe to 19 second-half pass­
ing yards, and holding the Scots’ 
premier rusher, Brian Grandison, 
to 95 yards on 23 carries.
“He was a great running back,” 
said sophomore defensive line­
man Ben Burton. “But I think 
we really shut him down. They 
had no running attack whatso­
ever.”
Grandison picked up thirteen
of his hard-fought yards scoring 
Wooster’s only first-half touch­
down. The six-play, 42-yard 
drive came after the opening 
kickoff was fumbled by the Tar­
tans and recovered by Wooster 
at the CMU 42. Five plays later, 
after a key third-down conver­
sion, Grandison sprinted around 
right end and into the end zone.
Rowcliffe connected with 
Grandison on the two-point con­
version, and the Scots led 8-0
with 12:45 left.
“We should have come out 
ready to play [on Wooster’s 
first offensive series],” said 
Burton. “But we really 
snapped back and played a 
good game after that.”
Wooster would not score again 
until late in the third quarter. 
Trailing 41-8, the Scots put to­
gether a 60-yard scoring drive, 
which began after a Jeff Morris 
interception. The drive culmi­
nated on a five-yard pass from 
Rowcliffe to John Tomlinson. 
This time, the two-point conver­
sion failed, and the lead stayed 
at 41—14.
The Tartans, meanwhile, 
scored early and often, taking 
their opening drive of the game 
65 yards in seven plays to cut 
the lead to 8-6. Senior halfback 
Drew Pizzurro took the inside 
handoff on a “joker criss-cross”

The men’s soccer team finished 
its University Athletic Associa­
tion schedule with a 2-0 win on 
Saturday afternoon. The win 
raised the Tartans’ overall record 
to 9-3-3, and gave them a final 
UAA mark of 4-2—1.
“We knew they’d be a scrappy 
team and play hard,” said fresh­
man midfielder Vince Russell. 
“We weren’t sure of their skill 
level, but we knew they’d play a 
tough game.”
The Tartans got all the scor­
ing they would need midway 
through the first half; sopho­
more midfielder Min Chong 
scored on a penalty kick, and 
junior Terence Sibiya cashed in 
less than a minute later to give 
Carnegie Mellon its final mar­
gin of victory.
On Wednesday, the Tartans 
won the on-field game against 
Grove City, 3-0, but suffered a

Carnegie Mellon University played host to the 
1991 University Athletic Association cross coun­
try championships on Saturday. All nine UAA 
schools attended the event; Boston’s Brandeis 
University and the University ofRochester picked 
up easy wins in the team competition for the 
women’s and men’s races, respectively.
In the first race, the Carnegie Mellon women’s 
team placed sixth in the competition, which fea­
tured 71 runners. Brandeis University took first 
place with a score of 29 (first, fifth, sixth, eighth, 
and ninth places). The next closest team, the 
University of Chicago, scored an 81, and the 
Tartans pulled down a 132.
In the individual results, senior Carolyn Lowe 
placed in the first-team All-UAA (top seven fin­
ishers). Her time of 18:25 in the 5,000-meter race 
put her in third place, almost a minute behind 
Brandeis’Jean Olds, who won the race with a time 
of 17:28.
Junior Laura Sibley was the second Tartan 
across the line, finishing 23rd in the overall re­
sults with a time of 20:03. Freshman Christa 
Sober had a time of 20:36 which put her in 29th 
place. Junior Wendy Evans (20:57, 35th), sopho­
more Aliza Hildebrand (21:11,42nd), senior Emily 
Burke (22:46, 58th), and freshman Karen Bryla 
(24:56, 67th) were the other Tartan finishers.
The CMU men’s team placed third in the team 
standings with a final score of 77, behind Roches­
ter and Brandeis. The Yellowjackets blew the 
competition away, with five Rochester runners in 
the top seven. Seniors James Dunlop and Joseph 
Mello crossed the finish line at 27:01 (Dunlop 
slightly ahead) and the Yellowjackets added the
fifth, sixth, and seventh places, giving them a 
meet score of 21.
The Tartans gave a strong showing — two 
individual runners were placed in the Second- 
Team All-UAA (finishers 8-14), and top five scor­
ing Tartans were all in the top 20. Sophomore Jim 
Langer led the Tartan charge, finishing the 8,000- 
meter course in 10th place with a time of 26:10; 
junior teammate Brad Shapiro placed 12th with a 
time of 26:23.
Other results included freshman Tim Davison’s 
17th-place finish in 26:42, followed immediately 
by junior Scott Phillips (26:43). Freshman An­
drew Reilly (26:45,20th), senior JonFrieder (26:46, 
21st), senior John Byrnes (27:02, 28th), and jun­
ior Russ Shorkey (28:49, 59th) were Carnegie 
Mellon’s remaining men’s finishers.
“We ran a really hard race,” said Langer. “It was 
a good preparation for regionals. The freshman 
did especially well; this team has a really strong 
future.”
The results were similar to last year’s champi­
onships, held at Brandeis University, where Car­
negie Mellon’s men’s and women’s teams finished 
fifth and third, respectively. Rochester’s men were 
not as dominating as last year, when the 
Yellowjackets swept the top five, and Brandeis 
finished third last season, with Washington Uni­
versity winning the meet.
“We weren’t really surprised by the results,” 
said Langer. “Rochester is ranked number one in 
the nation, and Brandeis is pretty high up in the 
rankings as well, so that in mind, we did really 
well.”
This Saturday, the teams travel to the Wheel­
ing Jesuit College Invitational, followed by the 
NCAA Mideast Regional Championships on No­
vember 16 at Allentown College. National cham­
pionships, should any CMU runners qualify, will 
be on November 23.

ated his spleen. The injury required emergency 
surgery, and Warren is still recovering in 
Presbyterian Hospital.
“Dan tried to make the save — he came out of 
the net and dove for the ball,” explained Russell. 
“The opposing player just kept coming, though, 
and kneed him in the midsection. It was a tough 
injury.”
In the game, Carnegie Mellon got two goals 
from Sibiya, and one from senior forward Rob 
Schaeffer.

Two possible AFC West 
champs battle tonight
Tonight’s game should prove 
to be a fairly interesting AFC 
West matchup, pitting the Los 
Angeles Raiders against the 
Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs 
come into the game with one of 
the top defenses in the league, 
while the Raiders have little 
beyond their 5-3 record to boast 
about. Both of the teams are tied 
for second place in the division, 
and odds are one of the two will 
win the division or steal a wild 
card spot. Take the Chiefs at 
home over the Raiders 27-14.
Two games to watch this week­
end involve teams that as of 
Saturday were undefeated. (Al­
though I picked the Redskins to 
lose yesterday). The New Or­
leans Saints travel to Anaheim 
to play the Los Angeles Rams in 
an NFC West rivalry. The Rams 
have struggled so far this year, 
while the Saints have quietly 
become considered a power in 
the NFL behind quarterback 
Bobby Hebert. Hebert led the
NFL FOOTBALL
by Dave Martin
Saints to the playoffs two years 
ago and it looks as if he’s re­
turned again to do the same. 
Look for the Saints to continue 
on their streak and become 9-0 
after this one. Saints 34, Rams 
21.
Also on Sunday, the Houston 
Oilers who rather sneakily are 
proving to be a strong AFC team 
take on the Washington 
Redskins, about whom there is 
little to say beyond their record 
coming into this past weekend: 
7—0. I assume that both teams 
will march onto the field 7-1, 
and that the team with their
second loss of the season will he 
the visiting team. Take the 
Redskins at RFK Stadium, 38- 
20.
The remaining Sunday games 
should look something like this 
(but, of course I can’t promise): 
The Niners over the Falcons at 
Candlestick, Dallas overthe slid­
ing Cardinals, the Jets over the 
sad Green Bay Packers, Miami 
in a much-needed win over the 
Colts, Buffalo over the Pats, 
Chicago over Detroit at Soldier 
Field, Minnesota in their dome 
over the Buccaneers and in the 
who-gives-a-damn game, Cleve­
land will allow the first Bengal 
victory of the year. And to close, 
the Broncos host the Steelers. 
Take the Broncos in a close game, 
a Bubby-less game, 24-20 and 
expect O’Donnell to look a little 
more experienced.
Tartan staffwriter Dave Mar­
tin is a sophomore psychology 
major.
The Tartans finish their season this weekend 
with home matches against Bethany College to- 
' morrow and Dickinson College on Saturday. The 
Tartans are particularly looking forward to the 
match against Bethany, a local rival as well as one 
of the tougher teams in Division III.
“It’s probably going to be one of the toughest 
games of the year," said Russell. “They have a lot 
of skilled players; in that sense, they’re compa­
rable to Emory or Washington University.
“Since we’re rivals, they’re going to play extra 
hard and bring lots of fans. We just have to make 
sure not to get out of our game. If we knock the ball 
around and give 110 percent, we should do well.”

November 9 this the day...
pjOTBALL, from page 11
^ raced 34 yards.
-They [the offensive line] made it 
easy for us,” said Pizzurro, the game’s 
rushing leader with 107 yards.
The Tartans led 27—8 at halftime, 
jjcr putting together controlled scor­
ing drives of 79, 64, and 55 yards. Two 
0f the touchdowns belonged to Pero, 
1Tho almost eclipsed the century mark, 
finishing with 91 yards on 14 carries.
The 64-yard drive came after junior 
defensive back Andy Helms picked off a 
Eoivcliffe pass at the Carnegie Mellon 
35 and ran it back 21 yards. The inter­
ception was Helms’ seventh of the sea­
son and broke the team single-season 
record set by Gusty Sunseri in 1979.
“Individual rewards are really attrib­
uted to the other 10 guys on the field,” 
said Helms.
The touchdown six plays later, a 
seven-yard run by senior halfback Greg 
Marmol, proved to be the game winner.
“Anytime, as a defense, we can get a 
turnover and give our offense the ball 
with good field position, it’s a definite 
plus,” said Helms.
“Thebigplays really helpedus,” added 
Burton. “Our pass defense is more of a 
bend-but-don’t-break. Sometimes, if it 
breaks, we need a big play to get us 
going again.”
All comeback attempts by the Scots 
were stifledby the Tartan defense. With 
time running out in the first half, 
Rowcliffe hit Brian Wright for 29 yards 
to the Tartan 40. But on the next play, 
sophomore lineman JonHutchison and 
Hession sacked Rowcliffe and forced a 
fumble.
“He [Rowcliffe] was flushed out of the 
pocket,” said Hutchison. “Ben [Burton] 
put some pressure on him and he was 
forced to come back into the pocket, 
where Mike and I sandwiched him. The 
ball naturally came loose and I was 
able to fall on it.”
The fourth quarter belonged entirely 
to the Tartans. Sophomore fullback 
Brian Horton scored on a four-yard 
run, finishing off an eight-play, 63- 
yard drive. The drive featured a 24- 
yard reverse by sophomore receiver 
Jarrod Siket that brought the Tartans 
into Wooster territory at the 32, and 
nice runs by sophomore Ed Ruland, 
and freshmen Jason Grusky and Mike 
Annichine.
“They took the first-teamers out 
early in the third quarter,” said 
Pizzurro, “so the younger guys got 
a lot of good playing time, which is 
important when you come down the 
stretch. Also, if we make the playoffs, 
it’s nice to have everyone getting expe­
rience.”
Horton’s touchdown brought the score 
to 48-14. But there was more to come. 
After senior safety Doug Stauffer re­
covered a Scott Szweda fumble, the 
Tartans were off to the races again,
marching 46 yards in 12 plays.
After runs of six, six, and seven by 
sophomore fullback Alan White, and a 
12-yard pass from freshman quarter­
back Matt Neiss to Siket earlier in the 
drive, Neiss scored on a keeper from 
one yard out.
“I don’t think it m atters whether you 
run the ball or throw the ball,” said 
Erdelyi. “The object is to win the game 
as efficiently as you can, and we played 
a very efficient game today.”
The Tartan defense efficiently held 
Woostertol4 fourth-quarter yards and 
a mere 68 in the second half. While 
Rowcliffe managed 133 total passing 
yards for the game, well above his sea­
son average of 84, they were not easy 
yards.
“Even though he was rolling out, 
there was always somebody around, 
and he really didn’t have time to set up 
and start picking us apart,” said 
Hession. “We expectedhim to complete
passes, but when you don’t give him 
any time, you take away a lot of his 
effectiveness.”
The Tartans are now 7-1 and are tied 
for sixth in South Region polls with 
Washington & Jefferson and Milsaps. 
The top three teams in each region 
advance to post-season play.
“I think we’re definitely in the driver’s 
seat right now,” said Burton. “We con­
trol our own destiny. If we win these 
last two games, we’ve got a good shot at 
the playoffs.”
First they must get past the Coast 
Guard Academy on Saturday and Uni­
versity Athletic Association rival Case 
Western Reserve in the season finale.
“I don’t think we can overlook Coast 
Guard or Case,” said Hutchison. 
“They’re both formidable opponents 
when they want to be. If we’re not at the 
top of our game —• and I don’t think we 
have been yet — and they are, then we 
should be worried.”

Let’s see. What sort of jokes can we make about 
the Tartans’ 4-1 win over Waynesburg College?
The goalkeeper should have brought a book 
along.
Good thing they switch sides at the half. Would 
have been murder on the turf on Waynesburg’s end 
of the field.
Good ideas, both (and neither was too far from 
the truth), but the game stands just as well on its 
own merits. The victory, which could have been 
much more lopsided, raised the Tartans’ season 
record to 9-4 and endedthe Tartans1 home season 
on a high note.
“We knew going in that they were a mediocre 
team, but we were told not to take them lightly,” 
said junior back Sonya Chmielnicki. “We just 
wanted to play our sort of game, running and 
passing the ball a lot.”
Sophomore forward Julie Paul, the team’s lead­
ing scorer entering the game, scored the first two 
goals of the game — her seventh of the season 49
seconds into the game and her eighth midway 
through the first half — and added her seventh 
assist of the season later in the game. If not for an 
expiring first-half clock, Paul would have had an 
opportunity for a third goal on a breakaway.
By the time the first half ended, Carnegie Mel­
lon had a 3-0 lead over Waynesburg, and that lead 
could have been larger. In addition to the Paul 
breakaway which was thwarted by the clock, 
senior midfielder Samara Lenga and sophomore 
back Anh Nguyen missed chances to cash in 
behind the Waynesburg defense. Nguyen’s shot 
rolled wide right, while Waynesburg goalkeeper 
Lisa Swavely left the net to smother Lenga’s 
attempt. However, with four minutes left, Lenga 
took a pass from sophomore forward Rachel Bourn 
and dropped a rainbow shot behind Swavely to 
make the halftime score 3-0.
The main component of Waynesburg’s defense 
was the offside trap — pulling the defense for­
ward to manufacture an offsides call. According to 
Chmielnicki, “they had a weak defense, but the 
trap worked well. We weren’t used to teams pull­
ing their backs up to the 50 yardline. You can beat
the offside trap if you dribble through it, but we 
like to pass because it’s what we do better.”
The second half featured more of the same. The 
Tartans had two main opportunities that didn’t 
come together. Finally, with 28:13 left in the 
game, Lenga blasted a Paul pass into the net and 
the Tartans had a four-goal lead. Waynesburg 
forward Louisa Buwana spoiled the Tartans’ bid 
for a ninth shutout with five minutes left, but the 
Tartans managed to control the remainder of the 
game for the 4—1 win.
On Wednesday night, the Tartans guaranteed a 
winning season with a 1-0 road victory over 
California University of Pennsylvania. The win, 
which came on an unassisted goal by Bourn, was 
the second 1-0 win of the season over California 
and CMU’s seventh win in eight games.
“Our main goal was to not get hurt because they 
play a really rough game,” said Chmielnicki. ‘They 
gave out a lot of cheap shots when the refs weren’t 
looking, which was really frustrating.”
The Tartans finish their inaugural varsity sea­
son on Saturday when they travel to Hiram Col­
lege. The game will begin at 1:30 pm.

Freshman Carolyn Skarada spikes the ball as junior Joanna Downer looks on. The Tartans beat W&J and 
Chatham Colleges this Tuesday and placed fourth at the UAA championships this weekend.
Volleyball team wraps
By CORRI METZ
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU volleyball team 
placed fourth in the UAA Cham­
pionships at New York Univer­
sity this weekend. According to 
junior captain Lisa Devlin, “It 
was disappointing to come in 
fourth, but I don’t think it is a 
terrible way to end the season.” 
The Tartans were seeded third 
coming in the tournament, and 
had hoped to place as high or 
higher than their seeding.
In the first game of pool play 
on Friday, the Tartans defeated 
NYU, 9-15,15-13,15-7,15-1; 
unfortunately for the Tartans, 
freshman outside hitter Carolyn 
Skarada sprained her ankle in 
the third game of the NYU match 
and was out for the rest of the 
tournament. The Tartans then 
beat Emory University, 16-14, 
15-6,15-13.
The squad lost to the Univer­
sity of Chicago, 8-15,15-10, 5- 
15,10-15, in the final match in 
their pool. Because of this de­
feat, the Tartans finished sec­
ond in their pool but still had a 
chance for the UAA title as they
began semi-final action on Sat­
urday.
Washington University, the 
eventual UAA champions, de­
feated the Tartans 15-5,15-7, 
15-3 in the first game of the 
semi-final. This loss ended any 
possibility of a UAA champion­
ship for CMU.
“We gave Washington some of 
their best competition. The team 
worked well together at times,” 
commented freshman Danielle 
Walter. “It was really easy for 
the subs to come in and play 
together with the starters.”
In their final match of the tour­
nament, CMU played Cli^jago 
in the consolation game for third 
place. Chicago beat the Tartans 
for the second time of the tour­
nament, winning 14^-16, 15-9, 
15—11, 15-2. “We played well 
most of the weekend,” said 
sophomore Jennifer New. “Un­
fortunately, our bad games came 
against Chicago, when they re­
ally counted most.”
Based on her outstanding per­
formances during the round 
robin qualifyingtoumamentlast 
month and the championship 
tournament, the UAA coaches
up season
voted junior middle hitter Lisa 
Leonardo to the All-UAA first 
team. “Everyone had a solid 
weekend, but Lisa had some 
outstanding net play. I think 
she really deserved it,” said New.
On Tuesday, the squad hosted 
Washington and Jefferson and 
Chatham Colleges in their final 
tri-match of the season. In their 
previous encounters with W&J 
this season, the Tartans had split 
the matches 1—2. Tuesday’s 
match was anticipated to be an 
emotionally-charged finale to 
the team’s regular season, and 
it lived up to everyone’s expecta­
tions.
In three hard-fought games, 
CMU defeated W&J, 16-14,15- 
17,15-13. “The win over W&J 
was a good way to finish the 
season at home. We went into 
the UAAs with a sense of opti­
mism,” said Leonardo. The Tar­
tans defeated Chatham in two 
straight games.
When asked about the team’s 
prospects for next season, Walter 
stated, “Since we’re not losing 
any players, we should have one 
of the best seasons CMU volley­
ball has seen in a long time.”

To shine is to be surrounded by the dark,
To glimmer in the very going out,
As stars wink, sinking in the bath of dawn,
Or as a prong of moon prolongs the night—
Superfluous curve!— unused to brilliancies 
Which pale her own, yet splurging all she has.
From "Ladies by Their Windows" in The Summer Anniversaries, by Donald Justice.
A diversity of voices. Fast and loaded, mellow and plain; the differences between these pieces help 
contrast identity, place, and time. It doesn’t matter if the writing is wild or subtle or a mix of the two, I 
perceive real worlds.

V,
Have You Met My Family?
anonymous
“You are my mother!” I often said this to my mother when 
growing up [including now]. The whole concept would hit me hard: 1 
barge into your life, demand everything, and when you give it, 1 take it.
It has to be one of the most lop-sided relationships known. Ah, but the 
pleasure you receive from my yellow crayon sunset; my macaroni tree 
ornaments and my perfected version of Yankee doodle on the organ.
This is what 1 give you for your daily sacrifices?
The situation gets worse when I think of all that you gave, that I 
refused. Here, I simply mean adolescence. I don’t want to get into 
that stale subject, except to say that the very staleness of it does not take
^ r1

---------------------------------------------------

away from it’s significance. So, all this hits me, and I say to my 
mother, “You are my mother; you did and still do to a certain extent, 
everything for me. You had a life. You swooned over a junior high 
school crush; were president of the jitterbug club; had visions of 
grandeur for yourself and you put it all inside so you could listen to 
me reenact my three minute conversation with the coolest guy on the 
playground; my pre-recorder recital jitters, and you even held my 
forehead when I paid the price for eating all the cinnamon sticks.”
In march the soldiers of guilt with their suits of armor and 
laser beam guns. How could I take so much from this woman? I 
don’t think there’s an answer really. The real question is why is 
so much guilt? Is this guilt a result of something specific in the 
mechanics of my family? Ah, a shiver in my wet-suit. It’s a 
frightening thing to dive into. I’m afraid of swimming along 
finding some ugly little demon that was planted long ago and has 
grown to be quite robust. I hesitate to explore the specifics here. It 
seems like such an indulgence to rave on about my childhood, my 
family, my core. Bring out my family album and flip slowly through 
the pages. This one’s a little fuzzy but it’s my cousin Paula 
pretending to eat the entire turkey in one bite. She married a real live 
lumberjack. Here’s Jason. We used to wrestle a lot. He called me 
ugly once. Jason was cool amongst the relatives: “Did you see what 
he had for breakfast this morning? A large mixing bowl full of 
Captain Crunch, Cheerios and Fruity Pebbles”; “Jason’s the starting 
quarterback for his football team, and he’s only a sophomore.” This 
one here is my sister. She looks like Susie Chapstick. The girl with 
the pink pumps is my other sister. Here’s my dog in the lake. We 
are a dog family. This one here is of my dad’s forklift.

---------------------------------------------------

Anybody bored? Smile politely; stifle a yaw® Families...they 
are about as complicated as a 2,000 piece lego set. CoViplex mechanics 
single to everyone’s whole famn damily (as my dad sajb) runs 
throughout your innards. Your family story is securely eiAedded 
inside. Inside your toes, elbows, wrists and shoulders. It’sVither 
boring, distancing, or interesting to look at someone else’s family, 
someone else’s core. When I look at others’, I think of my own\ Maybe 
it’s just that little part of human nature, comparison, swooping in and 
doing it’s dance again. You got chocolate praline and I got bluet 
delight on a cone.
Part of growing up means realizing that everybody’s sister, 
brother, mother, father, uncle, aunt, cousin, grandmaw, grandpaw are 
not like your own. When I was young(er) I believed that everybody’s 
grandmother smiled sweedy and agreed with everything you said. 
Everybody’s grandfather was a big, fat farmer who grumbled a lot and 
wore overalls. Everyone had at least one schizophrenic aunt, and a 
cousin in used car sales. It baffled my third grade brain when my 
neighbor skipped around with joy because her grandfather was coming 
to town. I gathered my fort equipment and headed for the woods 
behind my house when my grandfather came into town. He had big 
thick hands with horse feed and cow duns forever embedded in the 
cracks. He didn’t talk; he grumbled. He had thick black glasses and a 
threatening, long, wooden cane. Slowly, I began to realize that not 
everyone had the same families, the same lives. A pretty basic 
realization I know, but it often stopped me in my size four tracks.
I thought everyone had a childhood fdled with dirt-bike races, 
devil dogs, and popcorn balls at Christmas time. I am partly ashamed 
that I was so disillusioned as to believe that everyone had a ‘happy’ 
childhood and pardy hoping that it’s the normal misconception. Oh,

---------------------------------------------------

how obnoxious I feel, prancing around saying “I had a happy childhood, 
la la la la la la”. “A happy childhood”-indeed childhood is much too 
small to label it with a five letter word. Yes, happiness prevailed. On 
top of this happiness, or underneath it, or stuck on the side, though, is 
guilt.
So, here’s where the demon fits in. I can rewind and try to find 
who put it there. But, that seems ridiculous. More so, it turns guilt into 
resentment. Blame, blame, blame is such an ugly thing. It’s incredibly 
difficult to be honest to yourself, to have a true perspective on your own 
truths and beliefs. I fear self disillusionment. I fear blaming others for 
something that I should be blaming myself for. So, I always blame 
myself. Perhaps, this is the demon. I blame myself for being a 
’daughter’ and doing the things that ‘daughters’ do. “No, no, mom, I’ll 
put my diaper on, you go out and have a good time tonight.” Or is it I 
blame myself for feeling guilty, and really the guilt came first from 
somewhere else. Maybe it came from my mother telling my sisters and I 
“never to have kids.” Oh no, see the litde resentment sparks come 
flying out! Step on them all. Every time I think about this quandary 
the sparks grow dimmer. Their vivaciousness is waning; my resern 
is almost gone.
So, here I have this colorful,tangled ball of guilt, blam 
resentment, families and cinnamon sticks. I have asked my 
she could unravel it for me. First she says, “you think too' muchf* 
then, with a smile, “I was exactly like you.” So, when ] find myself 
taking tons of her energy, and her pouring forth support and other 
motherly compassion, I know that it will all turn around and I’ll pour 
the exact same stuff over some yet unseen and unheard of creature. At 
least, this is what my mother tells me. I too will probably plant a little 
demon into the gut of his/her stomach. And, I’ll feel guilty for it.

Wading Through Soup

When I was 3, my mama slapped my hands 
for plucking the Lima beans out of my soup.
I've always been that way:
picking my way through soup beans.
I would laugh a mile with Campbell and dance 
a jig with Lipton before I'd make a commitment.
It's nothing personal, of course.
I just keep choosing noodles over my heart.
Sure they get between your teeth, but it never hurts 
when you've swallowed too many of them.
Mama foretells that I'll wake to find myself drowning, 
but I’ve waded in and out of love 
more times than she's brewed stew.
I'm just hoping that when I've finally cleared my way 
through all the broth, you'll still be there to love me 
tired and soggy and all.

My friend Kathy was sitting home one night in the living 
room, watching a television movie with her friend Ed. They were 
both engrossed in the film, slowly feeding popcorn into their mouths, 
and did not hear Kathy's father descend the stairs in the next room. 
Mr. Rhoads was sneaking downstairs in his underwear for his nightly 
snack, when he heard the TV. He peered into the living room, and 
being nearly blind without his glasses, saw what he assumed to be 
Kathy and her brother sitting on the couch together. “I want the two 
of you upstairs and in bed immediately!" he commanded. Ed's 
hormones zoomed— this was the chance he had been waiting for!
He grabbed Kathy's hand. "You heard the man, Kathy! Let's go."

---------------------------------------------------

Kathy’s father is only one of many characters in true stories 
and fictitious tales who have foiled themselves by speaking too soon. 
Many is the time I’ve blurted out something like, MGosh, doesn’t our 
church choir suck?” in an attempt to make conversation with a fellow 
parishioner, only to watch one of the tuneless little angels come down 
from the loft into the arms of the person I was just speaking to, with a 
“Hi Mom— how did you like my solo?” a few minutes later.
Some people say it is merely a matter of tact, of learning good 
manners— I tend to believe it is more a matter of luck. After all, if I 
had known the lady’s daughter was in the choir, I wouldn’t have said 
anything detrimental at all. My Mama didn’t raise no dummies! I’m 
just tired of being a central component in one of the world’s largest 
jokes— the slapstick victim of open-mouth-insert-foot disease. When I 
was a child, it was considered cute. Everyone thinks, “Gosh, aren’t 
children so wonderfully honest?” Remember the Leggs commercial 
with the woman and child in the zoo? “Look Mommy, your ankles 
are wrinkled just like the elephant’s legs!” That commercial sold a lot 
of pantyhose to 70’s women who sympathized with the mother’s 
embarrassment, and sent a message to schoolchildren everywhere that 
to embarrass adults was to be an adorable TV darling.
I admit that as I became more and more aware of the 
propensity of the joke and of my potential role in it, I tended to try 
and create situations in which I could spurt off a one liner or two. But 
somehow, “Gosh Dad, your beard makes you look like an ape” and 
“Gee Mom, your eyes are wrinkled just like an elephant’s” never went 
over so well with my family. In school, however, they made me 
tremendously popular. “If there was a worm in the picture book, that 
would be you,” I told a boy one day, in an effort to help his opponent

---------------------------------------------------

win an argument. The boy got angry and nearly hit me, but his friend 
and the rest of the class roared with laughter.
Speaking cruelly was something I was cured of quickly, simply 
because I was never quite comfortable with idea of causing other 
people embarrassment. Other children caused me enough over the 
years, and I hated to contribute to the pot of vengeful insults brewing 
in the fourth grade. Still, there was a lot of humor to be found in 
speaking too soon, and I tried to find nicer ways to be funny. My 
favorite story of the foil of speaking too soon was about President 
Kennedy, who in an attempt to show the people of Germany the unity 
he felt with them, proclaimed himself not a Berliner (a citizen of 
Berlin), but ein Berliner (a jelly donut). Kennedy’s story let me to see 
that if the teller of the joke was willing to take on the embarrassment 
himself, the rewards of laughter could be great.
But the idea isn’t new. Some people have devoted their entire 
lives to purposely doing and saying foolish things. Jesters back in 
Medieval times dressed up in ridiculous costumes and sang songs, 
danced, told jokes (sometimes at their own expense) and even allowed 
themselves to be called Fools by trade. Clowns in circuses do the same 
thing today. They wear silly clothing, slip on banana peels, catch 
cream pies with their faces, allow their pants to fall down to their 
ankles, exposing funny polka dotted underwear— all for the sake of a 
laugh. Yet, even though people like this are employed, enjoyed, and in 
a strange way, respected in our society, most of us (myself included) 
are horrified by the thought of being laughed at.
Perhaps it is because the jesters and clowns are only playing a 
part, and are not hurt personally. Maybe they don’t identify with the

---------------------------------------------------

foolish acts they perform. Or, maybe it is because as clowns they 
have a strong identity. They identify themselves as persons to be 
laughed at. Most people don’t have such strong, one-sided identities. 
Humans tend to look at themselves as complicated beings, as 
mixtures of emotions and characteristics. Clowns don’t want to be 
taken seriously. People, on the other hand, often make their silliest 
mistakes when they are trying to be earnest.
So does that make the few people who do like to be laughed 
at strong people, or scared, weak people? Articles often claim that 
well-known comedians are actually quiet, withdrawn people in real 
life. And some teachers claim that class clowns are only trying to 
mask aspects of themselves that they are less proud of: a learning 
disability, for instance. Most comedians and class clowns don’t poke 
fun at themselves, I suppose. They pick on famous and popular 
people, politicians and movie stars, teachers and prissy, popular girls. 
But by doing this, they make themselves targets for abuse as well.
Some of them take what they dish out. Others don't.
My mother always said that being able to laugh at yourself is 
a sign of maturity. She said that when she was old she intended to be 
so mature that she would go around giggling constantly, and 
eventually somebody would think she was crazy and would lock her 
up. I don’t believe she actually meant this; I think she merely told the 
tale for humor value. But she would laugh at it, right along with us.
I think it is important to be able to laugh at yourself, simply because 
it lightens the mood in a crowd, and if you don’t pick on yourself, 
somebody else might.

---------------------------------------------------

Still, the idea can be taken too far. I once had a friend who 
could never stop ragging on himself. If someone commented on how 
ugly they thought a painting was, he would say, “Yeah, it’s almost as 
bad as my face.” If someone told him that a baby whale could weigh 
as much as 800 pounds, he would say, “That’s almost as much as 
me.” His humor just wasn’t funny. For one thing, it made everyone 
very uncomfortable. Laughter didn’t usually follow, just an 
uncomfortable pause. Friends didn’t know whether to defend him 
against himself, or to agree with him. After a while, it got to be 
predictable, to the point where people began to beat him to the 
punchline. Then other people were criticizing him (feeling that if they 
didn’t, he would criticize himself anyway) and he was hurt by their 
words. Obviously, then there’s a difference between a Fool and a 
foolish person.
Thinking about how people didn’t know whether or not to 
laugh at my friend when he ragged on himself got me to thinking 
about how people decide what to laugh at. One day in class, my 
professor asked why it was that people laughed at other people getting 
hurt. “Slipping on a banana peel for instance,” he said. “That’s not 
funny— a person could really get hurt. Why is that funny?” The class 
remained in somber silence, but I could barely contain myself. The 
thought of somebody slipping on that little yellow peel, then flying up 
in the air backwards and hitting their head on the sidewalk with a 
smack! just made me crack up. I can’t explain why it seemed so funny 
to me, but I laughed uncontrollably.
Obviously, TV producers don’t believe that the average 
American is a very good judge of what is funny, or they would not run 
their sitcoms with a laugh track. An interesting thing to note is that

---------------------------------------------------

the laughter recorded in “canned laughter” was taken from audiences 
attending old broadcast radio shows. Thus, most of the people we 
hear laughing are dead. This fact alone, along with the reality that 
most people do laugh at this laughter, is enough to make me chuckle. 
(As a side note, I used to be very impressed when the audience would 
break out in applause when someone said something particularly 
brave or stunning on Donahue or Oprah. I marveled at the sheer 
weight of the remark which must have moved the audience to 
applause. Growing up, I learned that the clapping was merely in 
response to a neon APPLAUSE! sign, and I felt very disillusioned. But 
anyway...)
Perhaps laughter isn’t a reaction to the degree of humor at all. 
Perhaps it is more of an intuitive response to an unreconcilable 
situation— a reflex reaction to a situation that doesn’t immediately 
jive with the brain. A friend of mine laughs when she is in pain or 
nervous. When she recently underwent surgery for a bulging disk in 
her back, nurses told her she giggled from the moment they attempted 
to administer the anesthesia until she woke up in the recovery room. 
My reaction when having surgery a few years ago was completely 
different. I cried when they gave me the shot to knock me out, and 
woke up still bawling several hours later. The body has a limited 
amount of “Default”responses, it would seem, that take over when the 
brain is out to lunch.

---------------------------------------------------

If speaking too soon can cause a lot of humor, it can also 
cause a lot of pain. People who are so anxious to get their point 
across that they don't bother letting the other person speak can 
really hurt themselves and their relationship with the other person.

S°Ur> and I'd
Rather than explore the horrid depths of cutting people off and 
damaging friendships, I'll let it go at this. Kathy's father is a fool, 
and it is his fault he Is that way. In his annoyance to be caught 
sneaking down the stairs in underwear, Mr. Rhoads had spoken 
himself too soon. For, only a few moments later, Kathy's brother 
Jeff, who had been helping himself to a snack in the kitchen, came 
around to the stairs. "Oh hi Dad— what are you doing up so 
late?" Had he waited five more seconds before yelling at her, Mr. 
Rhoads would have met his son on the stairs, and have failed to set 
his daughter up as Ed's concubine for the evening.
SPower of cheerful laughter.

Students review Int’l Festival
By NICOLE D. ALLEN 
& TARA M. SEMAN
Tartan Staffwriters
“Somany events, so little time” 
is the common reaction of most 
students to this week’s Interna­
tional Festival. As people walked 
through the lectures and exhib­
its ofthe International Festival, 
most of them probably didn’t re­
alize that the planning for this 
event began last March.
What did the students think 
of the International Festival?
Terrence Sibiya, a junior in­
formation systems major, had 
this to say: “I, as an interna­
tional student, am highly ap­
preciative of what they’re doing. 
I think this community needs 
international awareness in all 
aspects beginning with Asia, be­
cause we have such a large Asian 
representation.”
Student Government Presi­
dent Hyun Shin feels that “it 
provides an excellent opportu­
nity for the members of the cam­
pus community to broaden our 
cultural awareness, understand­
ing, and have a good time at the 
same time.”
Julius Palmano, a senior in­
dustrial management/economics 
major and president ofthe Asian 
Student Association, thinks that 
the International Festival is a 
“totally a new thing at CMU. 
The CMU campus community is 
not used to something like this.” 
Alicia Gilliam, an H&SS 
sophomore, says that she went
to one lecture and thought it 
was pretty good, “but people 
don’t want to miss class to at­
tend.”
Most students thought that 
the International Festival was a 
good idea, but they found being 
able to attend some of the events 
difficult because of scheduling.
Richard Gilmore, a freshman 
chemical engineering major, is 
a bit more critical. He thinks 
that “it looks more like a faculty 
thing. The activities are just lec- 
tures;more student involvement 
or interaction will interest 
people. I went to the informa­
tion booths out on the Cut, and 
the activities don’t seem inter­
esting. If I was to to go to more of 
the stuff, I might get a little 
more cultural awareness, but it’s 
better to do it one on one with 
that person.”
Though most ofthe reaction to 
the International Festival has 
been positive, most people of­
fered some sort of suggestion for 
improvement
Sibiya thought scheduling was 
a problem, and offered a sugges­
tion. “If you’re going to do any 
cultural or some kind of aes­
thetic activity, you’ve got to 
schedule it on weekends because 
people, Monday through Friday, 
they’re working so hard they 
have no time for anything. Per­
haps they could schedule things 
on weekends.”
Palmano agreed that “maybe 
a weekend would have had more 
efficient use of money and time.”
Shin felt that this year was a 
learning experience. “Since this 
is our first year, I’m sure we will 
find lots of learnings from our 
experience this year. We could 
have done a better job, but once 
again because of the time con­
straint and our lack of experi­
ence we did not foresee some of 
the problems that we faced — 
better publicity [for example.]
[We need to] try to make this a 
more-high profile program. Now 
that some students have at­
tended the International Festi­
val, next year we will have bet­
ter luck getting more students 
involved and also give them more 
ownership of the program.”
Aliya Khan, International Fes­
tival coordinator, believes that 
continued student involvement 
is essential to making the Inter­
national Festival a success in 
future years.
“The events where students 
themselves are involved are do­
ing much better. I would have 
liked more students to get in­
volved, more student power.... 
Asian students are given a voice. 
I was speaking with many of 
them and they said it was nice to 
be asked questions about our 
culture and it is nice to let people 
know or educate people about 
what our culture is about.
“A lot of people are really will­
ing people to share their cul­
tures with other people, they 
are just never asked.... Living 
here they know a lot about 
American culture, they would
like to give back or reciprocate.” 
To get an idea of the staffs 
opinion ofthe International Fes­
tival, we spoke with Amy 
Ginther, assistant director of 
Housing for Residence Life. She 
said, “I have attended several 
activities and have been pleased. 
I have been to lectures, and I am 
looking forward to the more cul­
tural events.”
Ginther states that Housing 
has played a supportive role by 
being “focused on getting RAs to 
get the information out to people, 
get brochures to students, to 
highlight a country on each floor 
with informational material, 
maps, or trivia quizzes. Our in­
volvement is minimal, and I’m 
trying to get to as many events 
as I can to see how we are doing 
at getting the average residen­
tial student to the event.” 
While Ginther enjoyed the In­
ternational Festival andfeltthat 
it was a success overall, she com­
mented that “maybe a strong 
start, a more celebrative open­
ing” would improve festivals in 
the future.
Freshman computer science 
major, Asad Iqbal, sums up his 
opinion of the International Fes­
tival in the following statement: 
“I haven’t been able to go to any 
of the events, but the Indian 
food at the Highlander yester­
day was awful.”
No matter how students felt 
about it, the International Fes­
tival certainly affected the cam­
pus.

A group of adventurers took a

deserts of Saudi Arabia, the 
jungles of Thailand, and the cit-

These adventurers aren’t in the 
Movies or on TV — they live in 
Pittsburgh.
1 hey’re students and workers 
Just like the rest of us. However, 
each of these adventurers took a 
Personal journey through some 
Part of Asia. They agreed to tell 
heir stories at CMU as part of 
e Personal Journey” series 
uring the International Festi­val.
The personal journey talks 
®ere held throughout the week.
ey covered a variety of topics, 
r0ra Political strife to working 
c°aditions and women’s roles.
Nine countries and regions were 
discussed, including Israel, the 
Philippines, Pakistan, Soviet 
Asia, Cyprus, Thailand, Saudi 
Arabia, Singapore, and Taiwan.
Abu Noaman, a research pro­
grammer here at CMU, spoke 
about the history of Pakistan 
and the significance of history 
on modern Pakistani life. A na­
tive of Pakistan, Noaman gave 
his audience a picture of life in 
his country.
“Basically, I wanted to give 
people a sense of diversity about 
Pakistan and its historical ori­

synopsis of Pakistan’s history of 
diversity. Pakistanoriginatedas

A plane ticket and a hotel res­
ervation are not always the nec­
essary means to experience the 
cultures ofthe world. Sometimes 
we are fortunate enough to have 
the “decorations” of different 
nationalities brought to us. Fri­
day night’s International Festi­
val Gala allowed for the latter. 
It enabled members of the Car­
negie Mellon community to jour­
ney into the Asian cultural world 
full of dance, music, and song 
without leaving campus.
The Gala contained diverse 
entertainment from Persia, In­
dia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, 
and the Pan-Cypric area. There 
was instrumental music and folk 
songs from Persia, ceremonial 
dances from India, and expres­
sionist dances from Indonesia, 
Cyprus, and Saudi Arabia. Al­
though overall all performances 
were excellent, the highlights of
the Gala were found in the first 
half of the program.
The first to perform were mu­
sicians Dariush Saghafi and 
Jahangir Mohammadi. Saghafi 
is a renowned santur player — 
the instrument that produces 
the original “twangy” sound 
found in much of Persian music. 
Mohammadi is a professional 
tambuk player — a bongolike 
drum that is played by rapidly 
drumming one’s fingers on it.
The music performed by the 
duo had an eerie tonal quality, 
but managed to capture the au­
diences’ attention. Both perform­
ers were immersed in their mu­
sic, making perfect transitions 
from one music pattern to an­
other. One could almost feel the 
atmosphere of Persia in watch­
ing and hearing Saghafi and 
Mohammadi perform.
The next group to perform was 
the Indian Dance Group of 
Hindu/Jain Temple. The group

Storyteller captivates audience
ByAMYPOTTHAST
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Once upon a time, in king­
doms (and other civilizations) 
all over the world, an art form 
both entertaining and edifying 
reigned. That art form was 
storytelling. Before TV, before 
radio, before books, storytelling 
was the medium through which 
morality was taught, spiritual­
ity preached, and last but not 
least, the medium through which 
stories were told.
Today, storytelling might not 
carry as much weight as it once 
did, but thanks to the efforts of 
talented performers like Susan 
Danoff, who visited Carnegie 
Mellon this week to share sto­
ries from Asia, storytelling is 
still an important and effective 
means of communication.
Danoff, who “discovered” 
storytelling in her late twenties, 
has a repertoire of 90 to 100 
pieces and presented six of them 
last Thursday night in the West
Wing TV Lounge. The stories 
ranged from a humorous and 
clever Chinese tale about a gar­
lic-stealing shack (yes, the 
wooden kind with a roof), to a 
moving story of a young Indian 
princess determined to save the 
life of her beloved husband.
“It’s hard to find a good story.... 
I read all the time and I have to 
find a story that hits me.... A 
really good story is full of sur­
prises. When you tell a story it 
has to be your story,” Danoff 
emphasizes.
In her own collection of stories 
from around the world, Danoff 
has a strong number from Asian, 
Native American, and Jewish 
cultures. She also knows many 
European and African tales, and 
even some from Latin America. 
Folk tales from a wide cross sec­
tion of cultures might seem for­
eign and distant from our Ameri­
can culture, but Danoff believes 
that “Stories are humans. [Sto­
ries] are something that tran­
scend culture.... No matter
where the stories come from, 
they can be shared with anyone 
from anywhere.”
In telling stories to anyone 
anywhere, Danoff found herself 
here at CMU telling stories to 
college students as part of the 
International Festival. As a pro­
fessor of English at Princeton 
University, Danoff did not find 
herself in an unfamiliar posi­
tion. In many ways Danoff be­
lieves that by telling stories in 
colleges, she is helping to fill a 
gap not usually thought of in 
high-pressure, intense study 
environments.
“Colleges are institutions built 
on books, but what I do is not 
based on that. Books haven’t 
been around that long. In col­
lege we care about how much 
knowledge we can absorb. Sto­
ries are about wisdom ... and 
values.”
In teaching at Princeton, 
Danoff has the opportunity each 
summer to teach a week-long 
storytelling, workshop on the
campus of the New Jersey uni­
versity. She works with adults 
of all ages and walks of life, 
helping and encouraging them 
to open themselves up and to 
communicate on a level deeper 
than mere preaching.
“It’s an opening, a real shar­
ing. Even though most of the 
people I’m working with are 
older, they’re really loose. They 
have fascinating life experiences 
to work from. It’s a situation in 
which age becomes insignificant. 
In that way, storytelling is uni­
versal.... [In order to be a good 
storyteller], you just have to like 
people,” Danoff explains.
The unbelievable unifying ef­
fect of storytelling, its ability to 
reject cultural barriers and yet 
remain inherently cultural, is a 
magical force existing in not only 
storytelling, but also in all the 
performing arts. And with viva­
cious and willing storytellers like 
Susan Danoff continuing the art, 
the magic of storytelling will 
never end.

RAs react to International Festival
By TRINETTE CHANDLER
Tartan Staffwriter
Student Affairs and the International 
Awareness Committee weren’t the only 
ones busy this week. The CMU Hous­
ing Office shared responsibilities with 
them to provide support of the Interna­
tional Festival.
The International Festival presented 
many unique problems to Housing and 
its staff because of its lack of familiarity 
to the campus community. How did 
resident assistants address this di­
lemma?
Q: As an RA, how have you prepared 
for or participated in the International 
Asian Festival?
Octavio Lubrano, RA in Mudge: 
Some of my residents are Asian. I tried 
to get certain information on the coun­
try where they are from. I wanted to let 
them know that I am interested in their 
culture.
Q: Have you been able to participate 
in the festival to its full capacity?
Lubrano: Actually it is tough to do 
that, because everyone is doing some­
thing else with their academics. The 
time that they planned the event for 
was a little bit too late.... I wish they 
had given us the information three 
weeks ahead or even a month.
Q: So are you saying that October 22- 
27 was not the best possible time for the 
International Festival?
Lubrano: Well, I feel that the Festi­
val should be more towards the begin­
ning [of the semester] or towards the 
end, not right in the middle, after mid­
semester grades when people have so 
much work.
Raj Putjah, RA in Morewood: I
think it was pretty good.... Publicity 
was key. One point that I want to stress 
is that on a weekend, if more activities 
were outside, that would have been a 
lot better.... Speakers like the Ambas­
sador of India came, I think that that 
was great. I went to the food fair today 
and that was pretty good.
Q: What other events have you gone 
to?
Putjah: I went to some of the per­
sonal journeys, and they were interest­
ing, and there was a storyteller and 
that was pretty cool.
Q: Did you do anything special for 
residents during this event?
Puljah: I haven’t had a chance to do 
too much with my residents because 
this week has been really tight for me. 
Outside my room I have a little comer 
set up especially for the Festival with 
all of the information posted.
I think [the Festival] was a great 
concept.... I think the amount of hard 
work behind the festival shows.
Q: What do you feel were some of the 
strong points of the International Fes­
tival?
Tracy Kilmer, RA in Morewood: I
think it was great that it brought the 
campus community together in a cul­
tural atmosphere. It drew a lot of atten­
tion from people off campus as well, 
which is great. I think something like 
this is definitely worthwhile.
Q: What would you like to see in 
future festivals?
Kilmer: I would like to see more 
nationalities, since we have such a broad 
range of ethnic students on campus. 
Focusing on Asia was a great idea, but 
I would maybe like to see its scope 
spread.
All in all, RAs felt that the concept of 
a festival like this was great. Most 
people suggested that future festivals 
include more nationalities and take 
place earlier in the year when the 
workload isn’t so heavy.
The thing that RAs and others found 
the most dissappointing was that the 
professors didn’t keep their end of the 
bargain. In light of last week’s Faculty 
Senate resolution to lighten the 
workload during the International Fes­
tival to allow students more time to 
enjoy the events, that didn’t seem to 
happen. Every single person remarked 
that they had the usual amount of work 
so that they couldn’t get to all of the 
events that they would have liked. 
Maybe that is something that can be 
worked out for future festivals in order 
to ensure greater attendance and paV- 
ticipation.
Performers fill Ballroom
GALA), from page LI
is made up of high, school students. 
They performed dances from north 
India.
The first dance performed expressed 
a young Indian girl’s reluctance to get 
married and her slow transformation 
into a young woman who decides that 
she is now prepared for a commit­
ment. The other dance performed by 
the group was a celebration dance 
performed on harvesting occasions 
and during festivals.
The movements of the dancers were 
swift and smooth. Each girl perform­
ing seemed almost entranced with 
shaking the bangles on her ankles 
and wrists to the beat of the music. 
Some of the movements performed 
looked surprisingly similar to some 
dance steps seen in American clubs.
The last performer of the first act 
was Ni Nyoman Rusmawati. She per­
formed an expression filled Indone­
sian dance that dealt with a bee’s 
interaction with honey. Rusmawati’s 
movements were small and graceful. 
Although there was not as much ex­
citement involved in Rusmawati’s 
dance as found in the dances performed 
by the Indian Dance Group, her 
brightly-colored costume made up for 
it.
With all the exciting music, dances, 
and costumes seen in Gala!, one could 
not help but feel culturally “satisfied” 
at the conclusion of the event. Know­
ing that there are other forms of enter­
tainment worldwide besides MTV and 
Broadway shows opens us up to new 
multicultural experiences — without 
leaving home.

“There are two threads of thought 
going here. People are different in 
Pakistan first because of historical 
reasons and second, because of geo­
graphical differences in regions in 
the country,” he says.
Noaman concludes that the most 
interesting aspect of Pakistani cul­
ture is that the people love to bargain 
for everything. Also, “Our culture is a 
strong family-oriented one and the 
people are very, very warm and hos­
pitable.”
Moneet Singh spoke about the 18 
years he spent in the Philippines. A 
third-year architecture major at
CMU, Singh says that although he grew 
up there, he is an Indian citizen. “I was 
essentially a foreigner,” he says.
Singh spoke about the Marcos era 
and the prevalence of government cor­
ruption and mismanagement in Fili­
pino history. “There have been a lot of 
improvements in the Philippines, but 
they still have a very long way to go,” 
says Singh.
Janet Dtantirojanarat traveled to 
Thailand in 1974 and spent four years 
there as a member of the Peace Corp. 
The experience was one of the most 
memorable and rewarding of her life, 
she says. She now runs a store on South 
Craig Street which specializes in items 
found in countries with any type of
nomadic lifestyle.
Dtantirojanarat spoke about class 
differences in Thailand and their rela­
tion to women’s roles. She also spoke 
about urban and rural differences in 
life in Thailand. She says that her best 
memory of Thailand is her “relation­
ship with the poorer people, the coun­
try classes. They were less sophisti­
cated than urban people, but a lot of 
negative things come along with so­
phistication.”
Other speakers included Amitai 
Rotem on Israel, Nancy Lubin on So­
viet Central Asia, Tasoulla Hadjiyanni 
on Cyprus, Badr Alotaibi on Saudi 
Arabia, Anil and Priya Balchandani on 
Singapore, and Julie Liu on Taiwan.

The increases in globally-averaged atmospheric concentrations of several trace gases have important consequences, not only for the atmosphere, but also 
for the biological species living on Earth. The chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compounds decompose in the stratosphere, releasing chlorine atoms which 
deplete stratospheric ozone. Carbon dioxide, methane and the CFCs all contribute to the trapping of infrared radiation emitted by the Earth — the 
greenhouse effect. The consequences of ozone depletion and global warming include direct biological effects from Increased exposure to ultraviolel-B 
radiation and Indirect effects from changing patterns of temperature and precipitation.
Dr. Joseph Z. Dickson, Pittsburgh physician, and Agnes Fisher Dickson, his wife, provided funds in their wills for Carnegie Mellon University to award an 
annual prize to a person or persons who have made outstanding contributions to the field of science in Ihe United States.
The university is pleased to honor Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland for his outstanding research in stratospheric chlorine chemistry.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 28 October 1991L3
Director of alumni relations describes vision
gy M.K. RODGERS
Tartan Forum Editor
Steve Calvert is a man with a vision. 
“I want community,” declares the new 
director of alumni relations at Carn­
egie Mellon. “[I want] people who enter 
the Carnegie Mellon community [as 
undergraduates] to establish a life-long 
relationship with the University... the 
University is a life-long community.” 
From talking with Calvert, it is obvi­
ous that he practices what he preaches. 
After graduating from Dartmouth in 
1968 with a degree in English, Calvert 
maintained contact with the school — 
to the point of returning to Hanover, 
N.H. to teach after a stint in the Navy 
and obtaining a PhD in English from 
Rutgers University in New Jersey.
Calvert never intended to become 
involved in alumni relations, and he 
never thought he would end up in the 
position he occupies at Carnegie Mel-

Ion. “Everything has found me—so did 
this.” Teaching part-time evolved into 
a job alongside the director of 
Dartmouth’s Alumni College, J. Michael 
McGean.
“I got started working on some pro­
grams to invite alumni back to the 
educational setting,” explains Calvert. 
That work was eventually transformed 
into a book, Alumni Continuing Educa­
tion, and led to a position as director of 
continuing education at Dartmouth.
Calvert turned his attention to two 
areas — getting adult undergraduates 
to attend Dartmouth, and working on 
alumni continuing education. Calvert 
is of the opinion that no one can appre­
ciate education for education’s sake — 
at least not as an undergraduate — 
until they’ve been away from it for a 
time. His reaction to the first Alumni 
College he attended — a lecture by an 
English professor at Dartmouth link­
ing Shakespeare and the changing 
world—was, as Calvert put it, “amaz­
ing, even to me.”
Calvert asserts that not much of what 
a student learns as an undergraduate 
means anything — at that point the 
student is sick of learning. Education 
beyond the undergraduate level is an 
experience which Calvert thinks every­
one should be exposed to. He intends to 
put this concept into practice at Carn­
egie Mellon.
“At the time I was approached about 
the job [as director of alumni relations], 
I was considering my career choices — 
choices that included taking a year and
a half off and writing a novel,” Calvert 
explains. “Then [the job] came along 
and it offered a chance to do alumni 
relations in a place that needed them to 
be done.”
Calvert states that Carnegie Mellon 
is a first-rate institution, with “the best 
undergrads, the best professors — but 
the University needs alumni involve­
ment.” According to Calvert, and in a 
strange opposition to the statements of 
the majority of the administration, 
money is not the issue. “The ask [for 
donations] is the last step ... any place 
alums have interest, they give money. 
The issue is establishing that interest.” 
In order to develop alumni involve­
ment, Calvert has many plans, some 
more ambitious than others. “The first 
step is what Michael [Murphy, dean of 
student affairs] is doing right now with 
the undergraduate student body — he 
is creating the family. That sets up the 
alumni to maintain connections, to want 
to remain involved.”
What Calvert wants to do with that 
alumni body is to maintain the “family” 
through reunions, seminars, and con­
tinuing education for alumni. “We need 
the alumni to be involved with these 
programs — key to this is empowering 
alumni to run the relationship with the 
University. Alumni Relations can’t do 
it. Alumni need to run the Clans—and 
the staff here will support them.” 
Calvert wants to give alumni access 
to faculty, through the continuing edu­
cation programs, and to undergradu­
ates, through programs like the Alumni
Mentor Program. While he admits that 
the social events — like the parties at 
Homecoming — have their place, they 
don’t really do anything for the alumni. 
Calvert says that is why he is planning 
on “building the program around what 
the University does best—education.”
When asked what he was going to do 
about the current problems with the 
Alumni Mentor Program, Calvert sim­
ply says “I’m going to make it work.” He 
has ideas and plans and hopes to imple­
ment them while working on some of 
the fundamental problems with alumni 
relations at Carnegie Mellon.
Calvert sees shortening the “time 
between nausea and nostalgia”—what 
he defines as the time between when a 
student graduates and swears he or 
she never wants to see the school again, 
and the point when the alumnus devel­
ops interest in the alma mater — as a 
necessity for getting alumni involved. 
At most schools, explains Calvert, that 
time is 15 years, but at Carnegie Mel­
lon, it is understood to be as long as 30 
years.
“We can no longer compete [while 
this is thought to be true]. We are now 
internationally ranked among research 
universities. This is as hard as it gets—• 
you can’t go back, you can’t decide to be 
a second-rate university.”
Calvert admits that there is a lot of 
work to be done, but the dream is al­
ready there. And it seems to have taken 
up residence in the twinkle that ap­
pears in Calvert’s eye whenever he 
speaks of his plans and his vision.
TEiD tb ybs tb :NDE ,N2U tbOOiQu iAt i EiAfb2UQCWander through Shadyside without going broke
By BOB DIXON
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Strange things go through the 
mind after that one too many on 
Saturday night. You find your­
self lying in bed talking to your­
self, wondering what you can 
possibly do in the state you are 
in. People do strange things dur­
ing hangovers.
Question: It’s Sunday morn­
ing. There’s a not-so-subtle 
'pounding in the back of your 
head. You have five dollars and 
some random pieces of change. 
What do you do? Explain.
Answer: You go to Shadyside.
You go to Shadyside because 
you can get a relatively large 
breakfast for $5 (Use the change 
for a tip, the service is good) at 
Pamela’s. Not that it’s anything 
new or even unusual, but 
Pamela’s gives endless refills of 
coffee. The thing is, it’s good 
coffee. I hate coffee, but I usu­
ally end up drinking about half 
a pot every Sunday morning. It’s 
great for that pounding in the 
back of your head. It also im­
proves your vision by enabling 
you to open those eyelids just a 
little more. The food is good too. 
Their pancakes are just about 
the best I’ve ever had.
Shadyside is also good on Sun­
day morning because all of the 
stores which would cause you to 
spend lots of money, which is all 
of them, are closed, so you can 
join the rest of the window shop­
pers in digesting that Sunday 
brunch.
Question: Why goto Shady side 
and spend five perfectly good 
nal-cash-money dollars when 
you could stay on campus and go 
to Highlander for fake Validine 
Money? (You can get lots of coffee 
there too.)
Answer: Are you kidding?
Rebuttal: Well, it is Sunday 
morning.
Answer: First of all, It’s only a 
10 minute walk from Morewood 
on Fifth Avenue to South Aiken, 
and two minutes left on South 
Aiken to Walnut Street. Walnut 
Street pretty much is Shadyside. 
Secondly, it gets your butt out of 
bed and out of your stuffy, dirty 
old dorm room or apartment. 
Thirdly, you know you’re not 
going to do any homework until 
at least noon anyway, so you 
might as well enjoy the morning 
off campus.
Question: What’s in Shadyside 
during the week or on Saturday?
Answer: Lots, last weekend, 
Shadyside had its own 
Oktoberfest. Local merchants 
had sidewalk sales. There were 
food, people, and all the things 
that typically go with German 
beer festivals, except the beer. 
They had all of the things that 
go with American German beer 
festivals.
There are other things too. 
Beginning from South Aiken, 
there are bookstores, pharma­
cies, a photo studio, several toy 
stores, a pet shop, the all-impor­
tant MAC machines—there are 
three of them in various loca­
tions along W alnut Street—and 
tons of restaurants, including 
Capp/s, The Balcony, Hotlicks, 
Giff, Max and Erma’s, and Pasta 
Piatto (on Bellefonte).
Two good places just for a 
snack are Shady Scoops and 
T.C.B.Y. Shady Scoops has regu­
lar, “frivolous,” and “gourmet” 
ice cream, while T.C.B.Y. has 
the standard selections and top­
pings found at every franchise.
There are places for audio­
philes too. The Listening Post 
sells stereo equipment that’ll 
make you drool and then clutch 
your tuition-ravaged wallet
when you look at the price tags. 
Everything is there for the seri­
ous consumer. Then for those 
interested in what to put in the 
stereo, there’s Waves with tapes, 
compact discs, and videos.
For expanding your wardrobe, 
there’s everything from Moda to 
The Gap. There’s also a lot avail­
able to expand your house’s or 
dorm room’s wardrobe. You can 
go traditional at Scandia Down 
Shop or avant garde at Liberal 
Arts.
There is also what is probably 
one of the best hardware stores 
in the Oakland/Squirrel Hill/ 
Shadyside area. Rollier 
ServiceStar Hardware has just 
about everything you could need 
for your dorm room or apart­
ment. It also happens to be the 
the biggest hardware store in 
the area within walking dis­
tance of CMU.
Question: Is all this expen­
sive?
Answer: Only if you buy some­
thing.
Question: Is there anything to 
do besides spend money?
Answer: Shadyside does host 
things, like the Oktoberfest last 
weekend. It also provides a 
venue for other art and cultural 
festivals during the summer. 
There is a lot to see for free if you 
can resist spending money at 
one of the neat-o shops.
In Shadyside you can also en­
gage in a unique form of people 
watching known as Yuppie 
watching. Shady side’s boutiques 
and restaurants attract a mostly 
young, polo-shirt-clad clientele. 
They are all there on Sunday 
mornings. There are also quite a 
few college students there, too.
Question: Anything to add in 
conclusion?
Answer: Yes, Shadyside pro­
vides a lot more things to do
than just those mentioned here. 
There are other establishments, 
restaurants, cafés, shops, etc. not 
mentioned that provide a wide 
range of night life and weekend 
outings. Places like The Balcony 
are famous for their live jazz
music, and Shady Scoops for 
their ice cream and other stuff. 
(Try cookie-dough in a waffle 
cone.)
If you’re really lazy, you don’t 
even have to walk. The campus 
shuttle goes by Walnut Street at
South Negley on the B and AB 
routes. You have to be really 
lazy though to do this.
And, if you don’t want to spend 
any money, leave your wallet at 
home. It doesn’t cost anything to 
look, in Shadyside.
Real vows remain untold
I went to my cousin’s wed­
ding in Westchester, N.Y. last 
weekend. I guess the recep­
tion part of weddings is all 
right. Good food, good drink, 
and a band that’s at least tol­
erable until the balding saxo­
phone player decided to set 
down his horn, put the micro­
phone right up against his 
bushy mustache, and break 
out into that risqué crowd 
pleaser, the theme from Dirty 
Dancing. While the budding 
Vegas superstar had the time 
of his life because he never felt 
this way before, my gag reflex 
was under the impression that 
the back of my throat was be­
ing probed with a Popsicle 
stick.
But something strange hap­
pens every time I go to one of 
these things. I’ll be sitting- 
there in the church before the 
ceremony, and all the married 
men in the pews will start look­
ing from their watches to the 
groom, their watches to the 
groom, over and over again. 
Then, when the lady with the 
blue hair strikes up the wed­
ding march on the organ, they 
stop looking at their watches, 
but continue staring at the 
groom with looks of extreme 
empathy, while everyone else 
is watching the bride come up 
the isle. That’s when their 
wives gingerly bludgeon them 
with an elbow that hubbies
WHATEVER HAPPENED

already understand from neigh­
borhood socials to mean, “look 
euphoric — now!”
It’s not that these guys are 
unhappy with their marriages, 
but I think they remember their 
own ceremonies, and all the 
things they weren’t told. Their 
wives would probably feel the 
same way if they weren’t so busy 
filling the unwritten require­
ment of wedding ceremonies 
which says that no one may leave 
the church unless the following 
63 questions are asked: “But 
doesn’t she look fabulous in that 
gown?”
See, married people are aware 
of a basic flaw in the wedding 
ceremony which tends to slip by 
those who have never hosted 
holiday sing-a-longs or driven 
the Chrysler Caravan. Married 
people know that priests can be 
pretty wily guys who, whether 
they realize it or not, have a 
talent for lullingindividuals into 
wedlock in much the same way 
the Tonight Show lulls individu­
als into comas. “For better or for
worse? In sickness and in 
health?” These words have 
gone flat over the years and 
are often spoken in that rapid- 
fire clergy style which seems 
like the priest’s secret way of 
reassuring the fat relative in 
the back that he’ll have him 
out of here and eating chicken 
in a jiffy. The way I see it, 
everyone would be much bet­
ter off if the ceremony went 
something like this:
“Will you, Harry, stick 
around when the most stimu­
lating discussions this woman 
can sustain will either have to 
do with high-fiber cereal, Milk 
of Magnesia, or predictions of 
bad weather based on pains 
in her calves?”
"And will you, Ester, put up 
with this man when, not too 
far down the road, he begins 
to develop a serious relation­
ship with the remote control? 
When he begins to unbuckle 
his belt and pants after a good 
dinner, and belch loudly 
enough to make the ashtray 
do a dance on the coffee table ?”
If Ester and Harry can then 
manage to expel an “I do,” 
they’re all set, they know the 
score. They dodge some rice 
and head out for Niagara 
Falls.

DIVERSIONS
Anthony’s latest Xanth book lacks magic
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Diversions Editor
Piers Anthony’s Xanth books 
stopped resembling decent 
pieces of literature (let alone 
good pieces of literature) years 
ago, but for some unknown rea­
son I still can’t kick the Xanth 
habit. I still buy these horrible 
books the second a new one 
comes out and read it right away 
__ no matter how hard I try, I 
just can't help myself.
Oh sure, it started out inno­
cently enough with the first book 
in the now infamous Xanth “tril­
ogy," A Spell for Chameleon. I 
still remember buying that book 
like it was yesterday....
I was only thirteen at the time 
and all my friends were telling 
me how good Anthony’s Xanth 
books were and that I just had to 
start reading them. So I wan­
dered over to my neighborhood 
book store, bought Spell, and 
started reading it that night.
“Wow!” I thought after a 100 
pages or so, “This book is great! 
It’s got fantasy, and magic, and 
monsters, and lots of really neat 
puns, and sex galore! I can’t wait 
to read the next one!” I quickly 
finished readingSpeü, managed 
to struggle my way through The 
Source of Magic (whichl thought 
wasn’t all that great of a book 
and had an extremely disap­
pointing ending), zoomed 
through Castle Roogna (with 
that great battle at the end!), 
plowed through Centaur Aisle 
(exploring Mundania, cool!) and 
continued reading until I 
reached book number six, Night 
Mare, the last Xanth book out at 
the time. I didn’t even realize it 
at the time, but my official ini­
tiation (or, I should say, my ad-
— Book Review —
**V2QUESTION QUEST. By Piers 
Anthony. In the latest book in the 
Xanth series the Good Magician 
Humfrey relates his life story.
diction) to the great Florida­
shaped world of Xanth had be­
gun — I was hooked forever.
Oh sure, I tried to break the 
habit. I tried for years to resist 
buying the newest Xanth book, 
but I just didn’t have the will­
power. I would walk into a book­
store and then, suddenly, there 
it would be! The brand new 
Xanth book, sitting in its big 
display case, singingits sublimi­
nal siren song “Buy me! Buy 
me!”
I tried to fight it, telling my­
self that these books were noth­
ing but trash, a waste of my time 
and money, but it wouldn’t work. 
Some part of my brain wouldn’t 
letmeleavethatbookstore with­
out that new Xanth book safely 
under my arm. And once I got 
home and tried to put it into my 
bookcase, the siren song would 
start singing again, only now it 
was singing“Readme! Readme!” 
And before I knew what hit me, 
I had somehow been suckered 
into buying and reading another 
horrible Xanth novel.
It’s been over eight years now 
since I first read Spell and I’ve 
come to a conclusion that I be­
lieve a lot of other Xanthoholics 
have finally come to realize — 
don’t fight your Xanth addic­
tion; it’s much easier to give in 
and read that new Xanth book 
and get it out of the way as soon 
as possible than trying to fight 
it. So when I saw the newest 
Xanth book in the stores around
three weeks ago, Question Quest, 
I bought it right away and read 
it as quickly as possible.
The story starts out with one 
of the Castle Zombie twins, La­
cuna, being extremely bored 
with her life and wanting some 
excitement. So she heads on over 
to the Good Magician Grey to 
ask him how she can alleviate 
her boredom. But instead of get­
ting an answer, she gets sent on 
a quest (of course) to find 
Humfrey in Hell, which she does 
in one chapter! (What a change 
of pace for Anthony, doing some­
thing quickly!)
In Hell, Lacuna finds out that 
Humfrey has been here for the 
last ten years (the last four 
books) waiting to talk with the 
demon X(A/N)th, to see if the 
demon would release Humfrey’s 
third wife, Rose, from the con­
fines of Hell.
What does this have to do with 
the story of Lacuna, you ask? 
Nothing whatsoever. It turns 
out that the only reason An­
thony even brought her into the 
story was so that she could tran­
scribe Humfrey’s life history (her 
talent is making words appear 
on any surface), and so that we, 
the reader, could find Humfrey. 
In essence, the book doesn’t re­
ally start until the third chap­
ter.
However, once Anthony 
changes gears and begins tell- 
ingthelife story of Humfrey, the 
book actually gets pretty inter­
esting. Well, at least for the first 
100 pages or so it gets interest­
ing. We learn how Humfrey be­
came so knowledgeable about 
everything in Xanth, why he 
started putting up challenges, 
how he taught Trent to use his 
powers when hewasjusta little
boy (as well as Iris), and we 
learn about his many wives.
There’s even a few pages de­
voted to nothing but puns ga­
lore, all of which are actually 
fairly original and quite funny, 
where he describes different 
types of tics he found around 
Xanth (such as cri-tics, roman­
tics, luna-tics, get it?).
However, a little more than 
halfway through Question Quest, 
it starts getting boring, because 
all he does is rehash the last 13 
books from Humfrey’s point of 
view for over 80 pages. It was a 
nice refresher course in Xanth 
history (a.k.a. the last 13 books), 
but I’ve read it all before, and, 
after a while, I got the feeling 
that Anthony was just trying to 
kill lots of space.
By the time you get to the 
ending, the pervert in Anthony 
finally gets out (as usual), but 
this time Anthony has really 
outdone himself. Through some 
very clever manipulation, An­
thony manages to set Humfrey 
up with sue wives, all at the same 
time. This even outdoes For Love 
of Evil, where all Anthony did 
was to have two wives occupy 
the same body.
I really wish that Anthony 
would stop playing out his sexual 
fantasies in all his books, espe­
cially his Xanth books, because 
when I read something like this, 
I don’t feel like I’m reading a 
story about Humfrey anymore. 
Rather, I’m reading a story 
where Anthony is playing out 
his sexual dreams through the 
characters he’s writing about.
But even after reading this 
disappointing book, I doubt that 
this review will stop anyone out 
there from buying it — or, for 
that manner, buying the next
Xanth book (I know I’ll still buy 
it). Let’s face facts, if you’re a 
Xanthoholic, then you’re one for 
life, no matter how bad 
Anthony’s books get.
So don’t fight your Xanth crav­
ing; just give in and buy Ques­
courtesy Avon Books
tion Quest and read it as soon as 
possible. Afterwards, you can 
relax and live out your life know­
ing that there isn’t a Xanth book 
out that you haven’t read yet. 
That is, until The Color of Her 
Panties is released next year.
Needful Things needs improvement
courtesy Viking Books
By HEIDI HOOVER
Tartan Managing Editor
The prologue says “You’ve been 
here before,” and many of us have. 
We visited the time four boys went 
to see the dead body of another 
boy who was hit by a train; we 
visited when a Saint Bernard got 
rabies and went wild; and we were 
there to see a writer battle his 
“dark half.” Needful Things is go­
ing to be our last visit, because 
this time we’re here to watch 
Castle Rock, Maine be destroyed. 
Unfortunately, Stephen King’s fi- 
nalbook about Castle Rock doesn’t 
do justice to his talent or to the 
town we’ve come to know pretty 
well.
The story begins when a new 
store called Needful Things opens 
in Castle Rock. The proprietor’s 
name is Leland Gaunt. One by 
one, most of the inhabitants of the 
town meet him. They all notice 
peculiar characteristics, like the 
fact that even though he’s ex­
tremely polite and nice, they can’t 
stand to have him touch them. 
Also, his first and second fingers
— Book Review —
?v2 NEEDFUL THINGS. By Stephen 
King. A strange man opens a new 
shop in Castle Rock, Maine, and 
systematically causes its destruc­
tion.
are exactly the same length.
King shows us aspects of Gaunt 
the townsfolk don’t see. For ex­
ample, his eyes look like they’re a 
different color to each person who 
meets him, and his politeness falls 
away when he has his clients alone 
in the store. He puts them under 
his special brand of hypnosis, and 
most of the time they don’t even 
notice. Throughout the book, King 
gives hints that Gaunt isn’t quite 
human, and confirms it by the 
end. The hints imply that Gaunt 
may be the devil.
Gaunt preys on the weaknesses 
and vulnerabilities of the people 
of Castle Rock. According to the 
book, he thinks of himself as “an 
electrician of the human soul. In a 
small town like Castle Rock, all 
the fuse-boxes [are] lined up neatly
side by side. What you [have] to do 
[is] open the boxes ... and then 
start cross-wiring.”
By giving people what they think 
they need (an autographed Sandy 
Koufax baseball card in one case, 
a pair of sunglasses that once be­
longed to Elvis in another), Gaunt 
forces them to help him by play­
ing “little pranks” on others. They 
convince themselves, with help 
from Gaunt, that the pranks are 
harmless. They never have to play 
tricks on people they care about, 
anyway.
What the townspeople don’t 
know is that every trick attacks a 
sensitive spot in the victim and 
sets off a violent reaction that 
causes at least one death, usually 
more.
Most people who are drawn in 
by Gaunt don’t ever escape; how­
ever, a few do. The most promi­
nent of these are Sheriff Alan 
Pangbom and Polly Chalmers, 
owner of a shop called You Sew 
and Sew, who also happen to be 
lovers. Pangborn, with some help 
from Chalmers, is the primary 
force in finally defeating Gaunt, if
only temporarily.
The big confrontation between 
Gaunt and Pangbom is the clas­
sic confrontation of evil against 
good, which turns up in almost 
every King novel sooner or later. 
Gaunt, of course, has evil powers 
that could easily defeat any mor­
tal. Pangbom, however, gets un­
expected help from the great 
Goodness, that mysterious en­
tity that also turns up in most of 
King’s work, usually inexplica­
bly.
Pangborn manages to get 
Gaunt out of Castle Rock, but not 
before his work causes the de­
struction of most of Castle Rock 
and many of its inhabitants. And 
the epilogue assures us, to our 
discomfort but not to our sur­
prise, that Gaunt is alive and 
well, setting up shop in a new 
place.
Unfortunately, when Stephen 
King brings his readers to Castle 
Rock for this last time, it doesn’t 
seem worth the visit. While King’s 
writing style is still enthralling, 
there’s something missing.

Erasure fails listeners with off-key new release Chorus

to the exciting crunch heard 
when biting into a rice cake) the 
music becomes bland (like the 
actual taste of a rice cake).
The title cut, “Chorus,” does 
not prepare listeners for the dis­
appointment they will feel after 
the music fades. The songis filled 
with strong keyboard and a driv­
ing beat perfect for club danc­
ing. Andy Bell’s voice, as in the 
past, is flawless, displaying just 
the right amount of emotion. 
After listening “Chorus,” one 
would expect an album of bliss.
Unfortunately, that individual 
would be very disappointed, be­
cause this great balance is not
found in any of the other songs.
Someone must have let 
keyboardist Vincent Clarke loose 
in Radio Shack with a rowdy 
kindergarten class. There’s too 
much primitive electronic fid­
dling goingon—enough tomake 
one suspect that a group of un­
derhanded six year olds were 
involved in the operation. One 
can almost imagine Clarke and 
his cohorts exclaiming: “Hey 
Andy, listen to this — space 
sounds!”
The only other musical high­
light on the album is the Latin- 
flavored “Love to Hate You.” The 
song has a driving, somewhat 
conga beat. The only flaw is that 
it will confuse those who want to 
dance to it. Is the shimmy ap­
propriate? Or perhaps that 
Spanish dance that involves the 
clenching of a rose between one’s

b, i )siMUQ QNrU 
riMU9
teeth? Hmmm....
Lyrically, “Chorus” also lacks 
substance. It seems as if Clarke 
and Bell opted for choosing words 
from a game of Yahtzee at ran­
dom. For example, although 
“Chorus” overall is a successful 
musical piece it has no meaning: 
Go ahead with your scheming 
And shop at home! You’ll find 
treasure while cookin’ up bones. 
Unless bone marrow has sud­
denly become a market commod­
ity, there’s no way these words 
can convey any message to an

audience.
The only lyrics that make 
sense are the Woah oh oh oh’s 
found in “Perfect Stranger” and 
“Love to Hate You.” Though pro­
found, the words can simply be 
translated to woah oh oh oh, 
whereas it is hard to figure out 
whether cookin’ up bones means 
that skeletal segments will be 
fried, sauteed, or boiled. What­
ever happened to the soulful and 
meaningful lyrics found embed­
ded in every song on the album 
The Innocents?
It would be unfair to write up 
a eulogy for Erasure right now. 
The group can save itself from 
impending musical death by 
veering away from primitive 
electronic techniques and by cre­
ating sensible lyrics. If there is 
no improvement there will be an 
onslaught of non-stimulating 
Erasure albums that are as 
tasteless as the flavor-varied 
Quaker rice cakes.

Become a member of the Saturday morning TV fraternity again
If there’s one thing I despise, 
it’s dumb articles written by 
adults telling other adults which 
cartoons their children will en­
joy most. I refuse to hide my love 
for cartoons, and I think it’s time 
we admit that toons are good for 
everyone, not just kids.
Last Saturday I took part in a 
long-forgotten ritual. Rising 
early (7:30 am, to be precise), I 
gotmyselfsomecereal, satdown 
in my comfy chair, turned on the 
TV, and for over four and a half 
hours, my eyes remained glued 
to the screen.
For the first time in several 
years, I was once again a mem­
ber of the Saturday morning TV 
fraternity. With countless kids 
across the country, I sat there 
all morning, numbingly taking 
in everything the networks had 
to offer.
What I found may surprise 
some. Contrary to the constant 
grumbling of many about how 
cartoon quality has deteriorated, 
I found many of these shows to 
be creative and funny. If any­
thing, the quality of TV toons 
has improved since the days of 
Scooby-Doo and The Super- 
friends.
Here, then, is the official Col­
lege Student’s Guide to Satur­
day MomingTV. We’ll start with 
the best.
Standouts. The most enjoy­
able Saturday morning pro­
gram? In my opinion, it’s no con­
test. Winnie the Pooh (8 am on 
WTAE-4) combines classic sto­
ries with great animation for a 
perfect half-hour. The humor is 
gentle, and the characters are 
well-formed and very recogniz­
able. Worth getting up early for. 
(I’ll admit that fond memories of 
an Eeyore doll may bias me a 
bit.)
In a close second is the newest
THE LAUGH TRACK
by A. Franklin Wheeler
entry from Disney, Darkwing 
Duck (9 am on WTAE-4). A fairly 
inept, yet headstrong duck saves 
humanity from evil-doers each 
week. Superb animation and 
constant action make this fun to 
watch. Another version of this 
show airs weekday afternoons 
on WPGH-53, but I swear that 
this Saturday morning version 
is technically superior.
Against Pooh-bear is an up­
dated classic, Tom and Jerry 
Kids (8 am on WPGH-53). Don’t 
barf yet, this is better than you’d 
think. Little Tom and little Jerry 
are a bit too cute for my liking, 
but Droopy (with his nephew) 
steals the show. High-quality 
animation (a bit too much shad­
owing, though) and a zany qual­
ity reminiscent of Tiny Toon 
Adventures help the show im­
mensely.
Taz-Mania (8:30 am on 
WPGH-53) makes a good com­
panion for the cat and mouse 
team. The Tasmanian Devil is 
spun off (pardon the pun) from 
Warner Bros, shorts into his own 
show. In the process, he gains 
parents, including a Bing 
Crosby-esque Devil dad, and a 
crazy cast of sideldcks. Cre­
atively, this show needs a bit of 
work, but it has loads of poten­
tial. One of the characters does a 
deadpan Woody Allen impres­
sion, and his moanings are sim­
ply hilarious.
The day dreams of a young boy
are chronicled each week in 
Bobby’s World (7:30 am on 
WPGH-53). Think of Bobby as a 
lander, gentler version of Calvin 
from Calvin & Hobbes. Howie 
Mandel voices Bobby’s father 
and produces the program, and 
it shows. The lack of good ani­
mation is made up for by the 
imagination of the stories and 
the humor in Bobby’s boy’s-eye- 
view.
Rounding out the list of the 
best is Where’s Waldo (11:30 am 
on KDKA-2). The skinny guy 
from the big books branches out 
to TV, joined by a canine side­
kick and an evil adversary. The 
animation quality is very disap­
pointing, but two things save 
the show: twice each week, the 
action freezes and we are asked 
to find Waldo (as in the books), 
and the narration closely re­
sembles the zany backstage 
voices in Bullwinkle and 
Batman.
Weird. I’ve always thought 
that when it comes to toons, 
weird means good. But these 
shows are so strange that I’m 
not sure what to think.
The weirdest by far is Little 
Shop (9:30 am on WPGH-53). 
Based on the film and play Little 
Shop of Horrors, this musical 
cartoon is definitely an acquired 
taste. The sixties, “boxy” anima­
tion makes it look different than 
any other cartoon. Sometimes 
it’s funny, but mostly it’s down­
right perplexing.
Mother Goose & Grimm (8:30 
am on KDKA-2) attempts to 
animate a comic strip that 
shouldnotbe animated. Grimmy 
is funny in the papers, but he 
looks out of place on TV. The 
pacingis too slow, and the voices 
are badly chosen. The result is 
an odd-looking and odd-sound­
ing show that just isn’t much
fun.
I’ve never understood 
Beetlejuice (9:30 am on WTAE- 
4). The otherworld of Beetlejuice 
andhisfellowdead folk certainly 
allows for a bit of weirdness, but 
this show really goes overboard. 
So much time is taken up by 
disfigured monsters, bony skel­
etons, and flyingbody parts that 
any sign of a plot is hopelessly 
lost.
Attack of the Killer Tomatoes 
(7 am on WPGH-53) is a weird 
show masquerading as a nor­
mal one. Good guys fight bad, as 
in many cartoons. The differ­
ence here is that the bad guys 
are huge, incredibly gross toma­
toes. This premise is a bit far­
fetched, yet it’s appealing. I 
could, however, do without the 
evil tomato who belches seeds 
every time he opens his mouth.
Take ’em or leave ’em. There 
are always a few toons that do 
their best to carry on the tradi­
tion of cartoon mediocrity. Bill 
& Ted’s Excellent Adventures (9 
am on WPGH-53) and Back to 
the Future (11 am on KDKA-2) 
are pretty much interchange­
able. Both are based on hit mov­
ies, and in both the main charac­
ters travel through time. Hint: 
Bill and Ted say “dude” a lot; 
Marty and the Doc don’t.
Pirates of Dark Water (10:30 
am on WTAE-4) is a very nice- 
looking cartoon that reminds me 
a lot of about twenty other nice- 
looking cartoons. It’s an adven­
ture about pirates; that’s about 
all I can tell you. Oh yeah, a 
couple of them have powers over 
nature. And the bad guys sneer 
a lot. What a concept.
I was actually pleasantly sur­
prised by Hammerman (10 am 
on WTAE-4). It’s about this nor­
mal guy who turns into a musi­
cal superhero with the help of a
(52U AU2UQ sAtUQuDbbt Beetlejuice.

pair of magic talking shoes. The 
animation is bearable, and the 
stories are nothing new. But 
M.C. Hammer brings an energy 
and a tongue-in-cheek attitude 
to the show that makes it fun. I 
was humming Hammer tunes 
for the rest of the day.
Stinky. Of course, there are 
some losers among the current 
Saturday morning crop. Saban’s 
The Little Mermaid (7 am on 
KDKA-2) is probably the worst. 
So poorly animated that the 
characters barely move, this is 
an obvious (and poorly executed) 
ripoff of the Disney film.
Captain Planet (7 am on 
WTAE-4) isn’t much better. The 
square-jawed captain and his 
teenage assistants from around 
the world save Earth from envi­
ronmental villains in a predict­
able and preachy half-hour.
Way Cool (6:30 am on KDKA- 
2) andif-7V(6:30 am on WPGH- 
53) are two live-action “enter­
tainment” shows for kids. Way 
Cool is a bit too cool for me; half 
ofthe time the hosts are drowned 
out by manic screams from the 
adolescent audience. AndK-TV, 
where “normal kids” get to do 
fun things like show off their 
Science Fair projects, is just 
plain boring.
The saddest flop is Land of the 
Lost (8:30 am on WTAE-4). Back 
in the ’70s, this prehistoric live- 
action adventure was goofy and 
corny — and fun. In this up­
dated version, the kids have be- 
come “cool,” and a chesty 
cavewoman has been added to 
the cast. Give me addle-brained 
innocence any day.
Old Faithfuls. The final cat­
egory is for those programs that 
have become staples of the Sat­
urday morning lineup. Garfield
& Friends (9 am on KDKA-2) is 
enjoyable, if not spectacular. The 
chubby feline seems right at 
home on the small screen.
The same goes for The Muppet 
Babies (8 am on KDKA-2). This 
is a fun show, though the cute­
ness factor does get unbearable 
after a while. The Teenage Mu­
tant Ninja Turtles (10 am on 
KDKA-2), on the other hand, 
are really suffering from overex­
posure. I know I’ve had my fill of 
the big green guys.
The one constant on Saturday 
morning (since the ’60s, in fact) 
is Bugs Bunny. Currently, he’s 
featured in The Bugs Bunny and 
Tweety Show (11 am on WTAE- 
4). These are the same cartoons 
we watched as kids, and they’re 
still fantastic.
Saturday morning is alive and 
well. One of these weeks, do your­
self a favor: get up early, grab a 
big bowl of sugary cereal, sit 
back, and enjoy some quality 
toons. Your brain will thank you.

Pittsburgh Public Theatre’s Hamlet takes the modern approach
By JENNIFER KERSTEIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Pittsburgh Public Theatre’s 
production of Hamlet is defi­
nitely worth seeing. It is a re­
freshing version of Hamlet that 
breaks away from the play’s con­
ventional presentation. Ron 
Daniels, who has directedifam- 
let, among other Shakespearean 
plays, gives the play an interest­
ing flavor. Daniels’ version of 
Hamlet has a modern feel to it 
that should appeal to today’s 
audiences.
By overlapping the sounds of 
the next scene and the lines of 
the current scene, Daniels re­
laxes transitions between 
scenes. For example, Gertrude 
blows out a candle at the same 
time the stormy gusts for the 
next scene are heard.
All of the sound and music are 
also done well, adding a rich­
ness to the play. The production 
uses a mixture of piano tunes, 
other solo instruments, and 
many sound effects, such as 
weather sounds (especially rain 
and ocean sounds). The music 
complements the mood of the 
play throughout, serving to 
startle, unnerve, or soothe. 
Sound also adds to the set which 
has an oceanic atmosphere.
This production of Hamlet also 
has a new approach to The 
Mousetrap, the play within the 
play. In this scene, Hamlet has 
the Players act out the murder 
of his father to get his uncle

Claudius to reveal his guilt. The 
Players put on an almost avant- 
garde version of the tale by act­
ing in shadow before the actual 
dialog starts. In the shadow, the 
king pulls jewels out of the 
queen’s mouth. The effect is sur­
prising and different.
Even the set has a few twists 
of its own. The background is 
tilted at strange angles, creat­
ing a feeling of sliding into the 
sea. The set, like a grand melt­
ing ballroom, is elegant, almost 
surreal. On the whole, this pro­
duction has a disturbing feeling 
that everything in the charac­
ters’ lives is slipping and they 
are powerless to stop it.
Hamlet’s staging is not its only 
fabulous point. The acting is also 
generally excellent. Mark 
Rylance is brilliant as Hamlet. 
His performance is very differ­
ent from other Hamlets I have 
seen. He turns the character 
more as a timid, psychotic, and 
maybe even academic Hamlet. 
The character is modem and 
real. In particular, Hamlet is 
wonderful when he’s manipu­
lating other characters. When 
working over Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern or Polonius, 
Rylance is brilliant. He is the 
perfect mischievous Hamlet.
Polonius is beautifully acted 
by Alvin Epstein and, like Ham­
let, follows with the production’s 
upbeat theme. The interaction 
between Polonius and Hamlet 
never fails tobrmglaughterfrom 
the audience. Derek Smith 
(Laertes) and Steven Skybell 
(Horatio), are two other actors 
worth noting for their especially 
effective performances.
The only character poorly por­
trayed is Claudius by Mark 
Metcalf. The character seems 
much more ‘acted’ than real. 
When dramatic, he is over dra­
matic; when he isn’t dramatic, 
he’s wooden.
One other drawback is that 
the play lasts a full 3 hours and 
45 minutes, and at times the 
fact is painfully obvious. The 
pace could have quickened in 
more than a couple of scenes. 
Ophelia’s madness scene was 
played extremely slow with 
pauses between every line. In 
too many scenes, the audience 
just waits for the next line. Also, 
in one or two scenes, the play 
grows overly dramatic. For in­
stance, Laertes doesn’t need to 
fall over and roll on the ground 
moaning when he hears of his 
sister’s death.
In spite of these things, Ham­
let succeeds. Be prepared for a 
long show, but definitely go see

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 28 October 1991in
joe Bob analyzes the Clarence Thomas hearings
What was the scariest thing to 
come out of the Clarence Tho- 
mas hearings?
Was it Strom Thurmond’s 
face? Naw. Even a man that 
ugly still has ten, twenty crotch­
ety years left in him. By the time 
he dies, he’ll look like a Klingon 
that’s had his nose scraped off 
with a cheese grater. So the worst 
is yet to come in that depart­
ment.
How about Anita Hill’s “Ice 
Queen” act? I have to admit, this 
was pretty terrifying, the way 
you would ask her a plain-En- 
glish question like, “Whj^d you 
call him on the phone all the 
time if he was breathing on you 
like a wild hyena?” andyou think 
any normal person would say 
something like, “I decided that, 
since he really couldn’t do any­
thing to me anymore, I’d just act 
like it never happened and 
maybe get something out of it.” 
But her answer would be some­
thing like, “I contacted Judge 
Thomas in the course of profes­
sional duties and conducted 
myself in a businesslike man­
ner.”
Huh?
In Watergate it was the bad 
guys who talked like this. Here 
we had the accuser talking like a 
stuffed-shirt junior high English 
teacher trying to confuse every­
body by using big words.
But that still wasn’t the scari­
est thing.
How about Orrin Hatch? Is 
this guy a party animal or what? 
Orrin reminds you of the uncle 
in everybody’s family who comes 
to Christmas dinner once a year 
and tells you how the country is 
being infiltrated by Korean 
spies. Orrin thought the way 
Anita Hill wore her high heels 
was a conspiracy.
Still, he was not as scary as 
Teddy Kennedy, who looks more 
and more like a wax statue of 
John Kennedy that got left out
JOE BOB GOES TO 
THE DRIVE-IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
in the heat and melted.
The female reporters who 
wrote all the “sexual harass­
ment” stories in the newspapers 
were really scary. I’ve known 
newswomen all my life. Ninety- 
eight percent of them know how 
to cuss like sailors. If you walked 
up to most of those women and 
said, “Hey, babe, I got a porno 
flick over here to show you, and, 
by the way, get a load of this 
rutabaga,” they would say some­
thing back to you so vile and 
disgusting that even the news­
papers in Sweden wouldn’t print 
it.
Were these the same women 
writing the articles about “the 
specter of sexual harassment 
that haunts the life of every 
young professional woman in 
this country?”
Gimme a break.
Did anyone besides me notice 
that all of this incredible office 
politics was going on at an agency 
called the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission? I 
don’t know how you read that 
name, but it sounds kinda like 
an agency dedicated to helping 
people have a nice easy time in 
their jobs, right? How could these 
people help anybody else get a 
job when they were spending all 
their time deciding who was 
more ambitious, more stuck-up, 
more rude, more black or white 
than the next person? That was 
really scary.
That press conference Anita 
Hill gave was scary — the one
where the University of Okla­
homa cheered her like she’d just 
scored a touchdown. This is the 
place that first made a hero of 
Barry Switzer, and now follows 
that up with Anita Hill.
That’s scary.
But the scariest thing of all, I 
thought, was one of the facts 
that kept coming up again and 
again, and none of the commen­
tators ever mentioned it. I think 
it threatens the future of this 
country more than anything else 
that came out of the hearings. 
It’s so shocking that I need to 
scream it in capital letters, for 
the whole world to notice before 
it’s too late:
ORAL ROBERTS UNIVER­
SITY HAS A LAW SCHOOL!
Now we’re talking scary.
Speaking of people the femi­
nists have recently tried to as­
sassinate, Andrew Dice Clay fi­
nally got his video released. Dice 
Rules was supposed to be amon- 
ster concert movie like Eddie 
Murphy’s Raw, but Twentieth 
Century Fox weenied out on him 
and refused to release it because 
they were afraid somebody’s feel­
ings might get hurt.
This is the concert the Dice- 
Man did atMadison Square Gar­
den early in 1990. Twenty thou­
sand people four nights in a row!
Let me repeat that:
Twenty thousand people four 
nights in a row!
For all those people who say, 
“Well, my problem with Clay is 
that he’s just not funny,” let me 
repeat that again'.
Twenty thousand people four 
nights in a row!
This a Guinness WorldRecord 
for comedians. This is super- 
mega-rockstar level concert ac­
tion. I’m talking Rolling Stones 
level.
Listen to me: Those 80,000 
people do not care who thinks 
Clay is not funny, because they 
think he’s funny. Isn’t this what
America is all about?
When Garrison Keillor fills an 
arena in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to 
read his stories about how some 
guy named Jess dropped Oleo 
margarine on his pants leg and 
got embarrassedin front of Aunt 
Meg, I don’t organize a delega­
tion of my friends to stand out in 
front of the theater screaming, 
“Get this guy banned from are­
nas, banned from the radio, 
banned from TV, because he’s 
just not funny!”
When you see this footage, 
you’ll realize how ridiculous the 
Dice Blacklist was last year. He 
does the same kind of material 
Redd Foxx did in the fifties. Sex. 
More sex. A lot more sex. And 
variations on sex like marriage, 
dating, cheating, womanizing. 
(Redd Foxx died the same week 
this tape was released. For some 
reason Foxx got a glowing obitu­
ary in the New York Slimes, the 
same newspaper that savaged 
Dice Clay last year).
But the main thing you’ll no­
tice about this tape is how — 
well, Dice isn’t gonna like this 
when I say it, but I’ve got to — 
how sweet the guy is. There’s a 
little mini-movie on the front of 
it, where Clay explains how he 
turned from a Brooklyn nerd 
into a Testosterone Tiger with 
the aid of a sequined leather 
jacket, and the whole thing is so 
hokey that you groan. It’s the 
kind of groan you let loose when 
your dad tries to sing. You want 
him to stop, but it’s charming 
that he tries. It’s that kind of 
thing.
And then the concert itself is 
full of the same kind of Don 
Rickies disclaimers that put- 
down comedians have used for 
the last thirty years — namely, 
he puts down himself (“I have no 
tolerance for anything or any­
body”), he does a self-parody with 
his macho posing, and he does 
outright apologies (“Don’t take
Andrew Dice Clay: This man is a pussycat. Really.
it serious, it’s a goof”). It’s obvi­
ous that everybody at this con­
cert understoodthe rules exactly 
— they even knew a lot of the 
punchlines, and said them in 
unison — and they understood 
that the people on the outside 
would not get the jokes, and it 
all worked as a unit. You can lift 
any onejoke outofthis show and 
make it look like Clay is a luna­
tic. (The ones that bothered the 
New York Slimes were jokes 
about midgets, handicapped 
parking, stutterers, and hunch­
backs, even though Clay started 
this whole section of material 
telling the audience he was
gonna prove that “I pick on ev­
erything!”)
Talk about a bum rap. Fortu­
nately, the Dice Man has al­
ready signed a contract making 
him the highest paid entertainer 
in the history of Las Vegas. If 
these neo-Nazis had really de­
stroyed his career, I’d be really 
mad.
No breasts. No dead bodies. 
One beast (the Dice Man). Sat­
ire Fu. Four stars.

Become politically correct and boycott Marvel comics
Forgive the change of format 
this week, but it is my civic duty 
to inform comic book buyers on 
campus of dire changes in the 
industry; changes which are oc­
curring at a monstrous pace. 
Where to begin? I suppose an 
explanation of the source of 
where all this information is 
coming from would be appropri­
ate.
Mr. Chuck Kozanski is the 
president of one of the major 
direct-mail comic companies 
(Mile High Comics), and is quite 
active on the entrepreneurial 
front of the collecting biz. What 
follows is essentially a summary 
of an extensive State of the 
Unionesque report of the cur­
rent financial situation in the 
comic world.
First, may I establish my dis­
may at the disgusting behavior 
of DC and Marvel Comics, spe­
cifically the phenomenon of en­
couraging gross speculation, a 
grotesqueness that arises from 
capitalism gone horribly awry. 
This summerX-Men was issued 
with five different covers, yet 
the same story inside. Surely we 
at the college level are aware of 
the blatant motivations involved 
in this scheme, and any one who 
went through with purchasing 
all five covers fell into the specu­
lation trap that Marvel tried to 
create. Horrible, isn’t it?
But wait—DC Comics is sink­
ing to even lower levels with 
their Robin II: The Joker’s Wild 
miniseries coming in a few 
weeks. This is a five-part series 
but will sport 14 different cov­
ers! My heart truly goes out to 
all the kids that are as big a part
COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
of the consumer population as 
we old fogies. This is blatant 
exploitation of wide-eyed enthu­
siastic youngsters that must 
stop. Greed is evil and filthy, 
and Marvel and DC should feel 
deeply guilty.
Starting in January Marvel 
Comics will raise the price of all 
the standard format books to 
$1.25. A 25 cent increase is mas­
sive in comics. I remember the 
good old days (not too long ago 
really) when books were between 
35 to 50 cents each. For many 
years prices went up a nickel or 
a dime at a time, but in the past 
four years Marvel has raised the 
price of their basic books by 50 
cents! They do this with no ex­
planation, no apology, and no 
remorse. Truly, their goal is to 
exploit the wallets of an addicted 
populace!
We should all applaud DC 
Comics, as they have always 
waited many months longer to 
raise the prices of their books, 
and though they’ll eventually 
succumb to falling to Marvel’s 
level, they at least don’t seem to 
me to initiate the evil that men 
do. Nevertheless, they are as 
culpable as Marvel in the end 
and we should spit on both their 
graves! Haha!
Wait — there’s more! Many 
readers collect comic books as 
an investment. This is part of 
the intrinsic nature of the hobby, 
yet DC and Marvel are showing 
disregard even for this, the most 
basic of collecting tenants. In 
the case of Ghost Rider #15, a 
glow-in-the-dark cover, Marvel 
raised speculation by asking dis­
tributors to buy extra copies. 
The distributors did so, ordered 
many extra copies, promoted the 
book heavily and waited pa­
tiently for their orders.
But Marvel didn’t ship as 
many books as it said it would, 
thus limiting the number of cop­
ies sold. Of course this issue sold 
out due to heavy promotion, 
Marvel made even more money 
from second printings, and low­
ered the value of the initial run 
as well. WithX-force and other 
big back issues, Marvel has been 
releasing a slew of second print­
ings. These second printings are 
very damaging to collectors, be­
cause they depreciate the value 
ofthe original. Truly despicable!
Gimmicks like multiple cov­
ers and trading cards, second 
printings, and price hikes are 
just the tip of the iceberg! Pay- 
per-view you have most likely 
heard of, but Marvel is introduc­
ing a Pay-Per-Pay concept into 
the market place. You pay Mar­
vel for the right to p ay for special 
Marvel products available only 
through Marvel and not comic 
shops. Though this is limited 
currently to T-shirts and vari­
ous paraphernalia, how long will 
it be before comics will be avail­
able exclusively through Mar­
vel? Evil rear your ugly hoss!

According to Rozanski, the 
source of all these insidious facts, 
Marvel is rumored to be plan­
ning the publication of nearly 
200 titles! 200! With that many 
Marvel comics flooding the mar­
ket, DC comics will become 
crippled and many of the inde­
pendents may simply drown. The 
independents and many of the 
DC’s are breeding grounds of 
today’s most novel and unique 
concepts. To mangle them would 
potentially cripple the creativ­
ity that is so essential to comic 
book growth. These are all ru­
mors, but it is well within 
Marvel’s financial capability to 
execute such a plan.
More horrible news. The two 
companies that distribute sev­
enty percent of the comics dis­
tributed to comic stores, like 
Phantom of the Attic for ex­
ample, could be potentially 
crippled by a series of disturb­
ing events. World Color Press is 
located in Sparta, Illinois, and it 
is on this site that most of the 
comics in the free world are 
printed. As this is the center of 
printing, the two large distribu­
tion companies have invested 
heavily in warehouses and dis­
tribution facilities in that area. 
Yet Marvel is considering mov­
ing to new printing plants in 
differentcities.Thiswouldmake 
the distribution plants in Sparta 
useless and would increase the 
cost of distribution. The extra 
price would have to be absorbed 
by the distribution companies... 
or maybe even the customer!
Why is Marvel doing this? 
Perhaps it is because the World 
Color Press is in financial trouble 
and Marvel is simply covering 
its bases. Or could it be that 
Marvel wants to monopolize the 
distribution business as well? If 
they controlled the distribution 
business, who would distribute 
the competition’s books? Surely 
this is all conjecture based on 
circumstantial motives, but the 
fact that Marvel is starting to 
print comics outside Sparta is
surely a cause for alarm among 
the comic book financial world.
What’s the message of this 
column? Perhaps the implica. 
tion that it would be politically 
correct to avoid buying Marvel 
and invest in other quality titles 
from other companies is the hint 
I’m trying to give here. There’s 
nothing we can do actually, but 
watch Marvel shoot itself in the 
foot and take down everyone 
with it. They are exploiting 
youngsters and loyal readers 
alike. Ultimately how we spend 
our money is the way in which 
we can send Marvel the mes­
sage that what they’re doing will 
not work.

Needful Things 
needs help
KING, from page L9
That something may be a 
plotline that warrants the 690 
pages given to Needful Things. 
Maybe King couldn’t bring him­
self to destroy the town he cre­
ated without giving it at least 
600 pages, or maybe this is just 
another case of the verbal diar­
rhea that plagued him in It, and 
arguably in The Stand and The 
Talisman. Either way, Needful 
Things is at least 300 pages too 
long.
One of the only redeeming fac­
tors of It, aside from King’s writ­
ing style, which is always a re­
deeming factor, is the relation­
ships he built between the chil­
dren fighting It. He has shown 
himself to be a master painter of 
interpersonal relationships be­
tween characters. In Needful 
Things there are hints of his 
talent in this area, but none of 
the relationships here seem as 
deep or as interesting as in some 
of his other books.
Another problem with Need­
ful Things is the questions it 
leaves unanswered. Questions 
like: Why is Pangborn the one 
who gets help from the great 
Goodness? Why not someone 
else? How is it that Gaunt knows 
the weaknesses of everyone in 
town, but doesn’t always have 
his facts straight? (In the cases 
ofboth Pangborn and Chalmers, 
Gaunt makes glaring factual 
errors that tip them off to the 
fact that he’s causing all the 
trouble.) King means to leave 
his readers uncomfortable, but 
not because of holes in the plot, 
ofwhich Needful Things has too 
many.
To the die-hard King fan, 
Needful Things is almost worth 
reading, just because he wrote 
it. Anyone looking to read King 
for the first time should start 
with something else. This book 
is verbose, repetitive, and no­
where near his best.

Short Films Celebration
In a whirlwind series combining the film and 
animation talents of well-known artists from around 
the world, AB Films brings together 10 short films 
in a custom-made compilation just for DH 2210.
From a legendary Betty Boop cartoon called 
Bimbo’s Initiation, to Tout Les Garçons S’Appellent 
Patrick, a live action short from legendary new- 
wave director Jean-Luc Godard, the Short Films 
Celebration samples and savors a variety of enter­
tainment tastes destined to excite any audience.
Also featured are three ever-loved Warner Broth­
ers’ classics starring Bugs Bunny, and an animated 
tribute to Vincent Price (narrated by Price himself) 
and created by Tim Burton in his pre-Beetlejuice, 
pre-Batman, Walt Disney days.
So take a well-deserved study break Halloween 
night. Stop by DH 2210 and check out the action of 
the Short Films Celebration.

Graveyard Shift
The people who made this movie probably thought 
that anything with Stephen King’s name on it would 
make money. So, in turn, they decided to fill this 
film with terrible special effects, high school level 
acting, and poor direction and name it Graveyard 
Shift. They were very wrong.
Yes, this film is based on a King short story 
(probably the worst short story he ever wrote), but 
even King’s name couldn’t save this turkey, which 
made no money last year when it was released.
Save your money and do something more con­
structive other than seeing this movie, like cleaning 
the toothpaste out of your sink.

A Fish Called Wanda
Are you up for full frontal nudity (well, almost)? 
Then A Fish Called Wanda is the flick for you. 
Before you guys get excited, it’s John Cleese who 
exposes his flesh, not Jamie Lee Curtis. Even if 
you’re not interested in naked men, the movie is full 
of humor and will leave you in stitches.
The star-studded cast includes Jamie Lee Curtis, 
Kevin Cline, John Cleese, and Michael Palin. Set in 
England, Jamie Lee Curtis plays Wanda, an Ameri­
can who is out to seduce her boyfriend’s lawyer to 
make sure that the boyfriend doesn’t go to jail. John 
Cleese plays the pompous barrister to perfection 
while Kevin Kline is hysterical as Wanda’s insanely 
jealous boyfriend. Michael Palin provides a wonder­
ful supporting performance as Ken, a bumbling 
associate of Kline’s, who is besotted by Wanda.
The storyline and the acting are first-rate. The 
movie’s worth your dollar for the laughs alone.

The Hitcher
C. Thomas Howell is Jim Halsey, the boy from the 
Midwest trying to get to California and live the 
American dream. To keep awake along the way, he 
rescues a hitchhiker from the pouring rain. Nor­
mally a travelling companion isn’t a bad idea; unfor­
tunately, the man he picks up turns out to be a 
slightly psychotic (yet wonderfully stoic) Rutger 
Hauer.
Oh, Jim stays awake, all right. It’s hard to sleep 
when your passenger is talking about how he’s 
going to kill you. He thinks he’s won when he finally 
gets Rutger out of his car, but the battle’s just begun. 
The suspense and action spiral out of control; just as 
the police have decided to clear him of the first 
murder Rutger pins on him, a whole new body count 
starts, and Jim is on the run again.
This film is a must-see. The tension just keeps 
building and building as the bodies pile up, and 
Rutger Hauer’s acting is magnificent. It’s worth a 
dollar just to hear him say, “I cut off his arms, and 
his legs, and his head, and now I’m going to do the 
same to you,” in a perfect monotone. Spend your 
buck on this one — for that matter, see it twice.

The Cult’s Ceremony is worth the wait
By FAYE LEVINE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Isn’t it nice to know that in 
this age of shallow, mass-pro- 
duced, sample-laden dance crap 
there are still a few groups out 
there who have stayed true to 
themselves and good old rock- 
and-roll?
The Cultis one ofthose groups. 
It’s been quite a few years since 
Sonic Temple, but Ceremony, 
their new album, was certainly 
worth the wait. While its few 
weaker cuts cause it to fall a bit 
short of The Cult’s earlier al­
bums, it’s a good listen, and 
worth checking out.
Ceremony’s theme is half com­
posed of a blend of finely pol­
ished hard rock and spiritual or 
Native American imagery. While 
this may seem odd or even 
cheesy, the Cultmanages to pull 
it off. All the more interestingis 
that, while the band has pur­
sued Native American themes 
in the past, they happen to be 
from the U.K.
Old Cult fans will notice that 
while the band grows and

changes, they are always unde­
niably The Cult. Their lyrics are 
generally more thoughtful, po­
etic, and diverse than those of 
your average band, and when 
they reuse an old theme, they 
usually manage to do it with a 
different slant. The music is rich, 
well-composed, and instant im­
pression. Their characteristic 
driving chords and rhythms 
don’t make me want to dance, 
but do make me want to move. 
That, combined with the imag­
ery they put forth intheirverses, 
sets my imagination in motion. 
They don’t need MTV to get my 
mind to envision what they’re 
trying to say.
The album gets off to a good 
start with its title track, a fairly 
standard Cult production, but 
by no means a bad one. Up next 
is “Wild Hearted Son,” a strong, 
fun piece with a rebellious chip 
on its shoulder. The third cut,
courtesy Sire Records 
“Earth Mofo,” is a bit lacking in 
lyrics, but is packed with layers 
of fast, grinding guitar. Things 
quiet down a bit with “White,” a 
solid song full of imagery and an 
excellent example of the hard- 
rock-meets-spirituality theme. 
We finally reach “If,” a some­
what sentimental piece which, 
although it slips into ballad mode 
in a couple of places, isn’t quite 
as interesting as some of the 
other tracks.
The second half of the album 
kicks off with “Full Tilt,” a 
healthy dose of good rock. The 
following cut, “Heart Of Soul,” is
a self-reflective piece dotted with 
some good guitar solos. 
“Bangkok Rain,” one of the 
heavier, grittier songs, is up next, 
blasting at you with a tense, 
faintly sinister air.
At this point we run into one of 
the album’s few weak spots. “In­
dian,” is an interesting tangent, 
with its gentle acoustic sound 
and cello in the background. Un­
fortunately, the lyrics, which are 
repetitive and a bit sappy, don’t 
do it justice. The next song, 
“Sweet Salvation,” is a some­
what typical love-and-devotion 
piece which borders on mushy 
in some places. Afterthat, things 
perk up again, and “Wonder­
land” caps the album off nicely.
Ceremony is interesting be­
cause it combines aspects of the 
Cult’s previous albums. Musi­
cally, it has many of the same 
elements as Sonic Temple, but 
is on the whole a touch more 
sedate, like Love. As for the lyr­
ics, the more spiritual pieces 
hearken back to Dream time; the 
choppier, grittier ones to Elec­
tric and the straightforward 
hard rock pieces to Sonic Temple.
Carnegie Mellon Trio to perform tonight
By MARY YEE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
This coming Monday, the Car­
negie Mellon Trio will be per­
forming at the Mellon Institute 
Auditorium at 8 pm. This fac­
ulty trio is composed of violinist 
Andres Cardenes, pianistDavid 
Deveau, and newcomer to CMU, 
cellist Ann Martindale Williams. 
Classical music from Beethoven 
will be the heart of the evening’s 
performance.
It was the chamber group’s 
common love for music that 
brought the musicians Cardenes 
and Deveau together with Wil­
liams.
“Andres Cardenes and I are 
in the Pittsburgh Symphony. We 
have very similar ideas about 
our music. We feel, look at, and 
understand music with a com­
mon perspective. It’s very diffi­
cult to find partners who also 
share your view on your art form, 
especially in chamber music. 
Andres and David had worked 
for a few years together. They 
performed in a series of 
Beethoven pieces. Andres and 
David got along very well. I 
worked very well with Andres, 
so we all decided to get together 
to form our trio.”
Chamber music is normally 
adopted as part of the repertoire 
for a small group of classical 
musicians to work together. Said 
Williams, “Chamber music was 
originally played for the aristoc­
racy, in an intimate setting, by

at 8 pm.
smaller groups of musicians. The 
great thing about chamber mu­
sic is that the interaction be­
tween players causes them to be 
equal workers in the group. Each 
person is dependent upon one 
another. We have to work out 
problems amongst ourselves. 
There isn’t a conductor there to 
tell us when each of us should 
play.” Thus, chamber music al­
lows a group the freedom needed 
to experiment and create their 
own unique sound.
•“The cello has a sound that is 
natural. It reminds one of the 
sonority of the human voice. This 
instrument also plays a wide 
range of notes on the scale,” said 
Williams. “I don’t have to hold it 
up like the violin. I feel very 
close to the cello because it is 
held against my body. At the 
same time, however, there is the 
difficulty of dragging it, and buy­
ing tickets on the plane for its 
space. Sometimes, I feel as if I 
were dragging a ball and chain.”
Inspired by British musician, 
Jacquelyn Dupres, Williams de­
cided to pursue her dreams in 
the music world. Her mother 
was already a cellist. At the pro­
digious age of seven, Williams 
began her training.
“I got my daily practice with a
teacher who taught the cello. 
My sister is in the Philadelphia 
Orchestra. She plays the violin. 
However, my father doesn’t play 
[any instruments] at all. He loves 
and supports our performances.”
Williams was further encour­
aged to continue her works as a 
cellist with inspiration from 
other cellists such as YoYo Ma 
who is well renowned in his field. 
Williams admires his expertise 
as a solo artist.
Concerning second thoughts 
about choosing to pursue a ca­
reer in music, Williams says, 
“There are times when I wish I 
had a normal nine-to-five job. A 
faculty musician’s multiple 
roles, such as teaching, playing 
chamber music, playing solos, 
rehearsing, and attending spe­
cial events — such as dinners 
— occupy a lot of time. However, 
there are moments I achieve in 
performances where I find my 
career well worth the work I do. 
All the rehearsals come together 
to produce a sweet, satisfying, 
and rewarding outcome.”
Not only does Williams play 
on the Carnegie Mellon Trio, 
but she also teaches apart from 
her professional performances.
“Teaching is complementary 
to my professional musical per­
formances. The more I teach, 
the more I understand my own
playing,” said Williams. “Look­
ing at and listening to someone’s 
problems enables me to pinpoint 
my own problems. I try to apply 
what I can learn from others to 
myself. This increases my work 
speed, aids in setting my goals 
in practice and thus, I am more 
prepared to perform. Similarly, 
the more I perform, the more 
experience I can offer to my stu­
dents to give them advice on 
their performance.”
One of the greatest satisfac­
tions a teacher will achieve is to 
enlighten a student. “When I 
explain and advise a student to 
approach a different style, I try 
to use specific examples,” ex­
plained Williams. “I tell my stu­
dents not to be discouraged if 
they feel that they have not 
achieved anything at all during 
practice. It is part of a musician’s 
life that practice may not help at 
all sometimes. I am patient with 
my students. Moments where a 
student comprehends my advice 
and acts on it well make me very 
happy about my role as their 
mentor.”
With a talented performer and 
teacher such as Williams and 
the fine musicianship of 
Cardenes and Deveau, a night 
of Beethoven can be quite an 
experience. A little night music 
will warm your heart.
