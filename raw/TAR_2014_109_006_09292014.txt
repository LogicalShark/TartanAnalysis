Editor-in-Chief
Senior decision science ma-
jor Tonya Sedgwick delivered 
a speech on Friday in front of 
Warner Hall expressing dissat-
isfaction with Decisions That 
Matter, a university publica-
tion regarding sexual assault, 
as well as a quote by Dean of 
Student Affairs Gina Casa-
legno printed in a Tartan news 
article responding to a Letter 
to the Editor signed by 35 past 
and current students, includ-
ing Sedgwick.
On Sept. 12, Casalegno 
emailed the campus commu-
nity enumerating the initia-
tives relating to sexual harass-
ment and sexual violence that 
the university has established 
over the past year or plans to 
establish. Among the com-
pleted initiatives listed is the 
development of Decisions That 
Matter. Casalegno states in the 
email that the purpose of the 
publication is “to educate the 
university community about 
your rights, resources, and re-
sponsibilities regarding sexual 
assault, dating violence, do-
mestic violence, and stalking.”
Sedgwick, speaking at ap-
proximately 4 p.m. through a 
megaphone and standing on a 
barrier in front of Warner Hall, 
said, “I’ve come before you to-
day in an act of solidarity with 
my fellow students, some of 
whom have suffered not only 
at the hands of sexual preda-
tors, but also at the hands of 
university of?cials. This prob-
lem, which is not localized to 
Carnegie Mellon, nor to Pitts-
burgh, but to all of the United 
States of America and beyond, 
is one that has garnered re-
cent attention from the White 
House and elsewhere.”
Sedgwick told a story about 
a boy she grew up with and 
his unwelcome advances (“at-
tempting to convince me to 
have sex with him”). She said 
that when she told her friends 
she didn’t want to hang out 
with him in a group setting, 
her friends told her to stop 
“bashing” the boy — “as if say-
ing ‘he tried to bully me into 
having sex with him’ was the 
same as slandering someone.”
She then said, “I want to 
talk to you, my fellow stu-
dents, about Decisions That 
Matter, because the pamphlet 
that has been written under 
that name got it wrong.”
Sedgwick said that the pam-
phlet does not discourage per-
petrators from committing acts 
of sexual violence nor outline 
consequences of these acts, but 
rather provides information 
telling people what actions to 
take to protect themselves from 
the potential of an assault.
“It is not the decisions of all 
of us that matter,” Sedgwick 
said, referring to the quote 
made by Casalegno published 
in The Tartan last week. “It 
is the decisions of those who 
have power that matter. In a 
situation where someone is a 
perpetrator, and someone is a 
victim, the perpetrator has all 
the power.”
Sedgwick said to those lis-
tening that people have a duty 
to act, “to speak up and say 
‘Hey, that’s not okay — she 
asked you to stop.’ ”
“The most important per-
son who can prevent sexual 
violence is you, and I want you 
to know it, and I want you to 
live it, and I want the univer-
sity to give you the tools to do 
so,” she concluded.
Sedgwick asked if others 
would like to comment at the 
end of the speech, to which 
sophomore creative writing 
major Nathalie Kent said, “You 
said it well.”
Sedgwick later told The 
Tartan, “I think that it was im-
portant [to give the speech] 
because there were a lot of 
people who were upset or 
seemed upset with the pam-
phlet and other things relating 
to the pamphlet, but no one re-
ally was doing anything, and I 
believe that if you want to en-
force change-making, that you 
should offer advice, but you 
should also make sure that 
people know — that people 
care about this.”
Casalegno attended the 
speech and, at its conclusion, 
spoke with Sedgwick, sit-
ting with her on the barrier 
upon which the speech was 
delivered.
“I really appreciate that 
Tonya had the courage to step 
up in front of all of these people 
and share her own story and her 
thoughts about how we, as an 
institution, can do better in this 
regard,” Casalegno said. “We’ll 
only get better as an institu-
tion by people coming forward 
and talking about these issues 
and sharing their thoughts and 
their perspectives.”
Casalegno said that she 
was told about the speech by 
several students and “cleared 
my schedule to make sure that 
I could be here both to hear 
and listen, and also interact 
with other students who care 
about these issues.”
Casalegno also said that 
she discussed the Rape, 
Abuse, and Incest National 
Network (RAINN) with Sedg-
wick. Casalegno mentioned to 
The Tartan that the university 
amended a section of the An-
nual Security and Fire Safety 
Report last week based on re-
sources about risk reduction 
education provided by RAINN, 
which describes itself as an 
anti-sexual assault organiza-
tion. The 2014 guide is due to 
the campus by Wednesday, ac-
cording to Casalegno.
The Annual Security and 
Fire Safety Report contains in-
formation about the universi-
ty’s ?re and safety policies and 
other resources for students. 
The 2013 report contained a 
section titled “Preventing and 
Responding to Sexual Harass-
ment and Sexual Assault.”
Junior directing major John 
Moriarty said of the speech, “I 
thought it was a great avenue 
for people who are concerned 
about sexual assault at Carn-
egie Mellon and elsewhere to 
be able to have their voices 
heard. I think it is a testament 
to the school how many people 
stopped and watched, but also 
how many people walked by.” 
“We are not a politically ac-
tive campus, and that is very, 
very evident when it comes 
to this issue that is so close to 
us, that affects everyone, men 
and women,” Moriarty added.  
“Tonya gives light and shows 
that there are students who do 
care, and the louder they are 
the more likely others will feel 
comfortable to stand up.”
Moriarty is creating a 
docudrama about how Carn-
egie Mellon and other colleges 
across the country have been 
handling sexual assault and 
rape cases, and the dialogues 
between students and fac-
ulty, focusing speci?cally on 
consequences for aggressors.

Water main break disrupts campus
BRADEN KELNER
Editor-in-Chief
On Sept. 21, Carnegie 
Mellon reported that the 
Pittsburgh Water and Sewer 
Authority repaired a 20-inch 
water main break on Forbes 
Avenue.
Those signed up for Carn-
egie Mellon’s alert system 
received text message and 
call alerts shortly after 10 
a.m. on the morning of the 
repair. 
The text alerts read, 
“Main water line failure to 
Pittsburgh Campus[:] A main 
water line has failed causing 
disruption to most of [main] 
campus.”
An email sent out on Sept. 
20 to campus members said 
that disruption to water ser-
vice could occur between 8 
a.m. and 6 p.m. on Sept. 21.
The email speci?ed that 
16 campus facilities were ex-
pected to be affected: Wood-
lawn Apartments, Margaret 
Morrison Apartments, Skibo 
Gym, Doherty Apartments, 
the Greek Quadrangle, and 
Roselawn, Stever, Mudge, 
Spirit, Hamerschlag, McGill, 
Boss, Henderson, Welch, 
Scobell, and Donner Houses. 
The university later listed 
more than 20 affected build-
ings on its alert website.
The email encouraged 
students to “reserve some 
drinking water before the 
service interruption” and 
said that restrooms were 
not to be used in the affect-
ed buildings, but could be 
used in other buildings not 
affected by the water main 
break.
Campus alerts were sent 
shortly after 12 p.m. on Sept. 
21 informing campus mem-
bers that the water main was 
repaired and all campus fa-
cilities were being serviced 
normally.
Carnegie Mellon’s Stu-
dent Information Online 
(SIO) states that it uses 
students’ inputted mobile 
phone numbers  to enroll 
them into the university’s 
emergency alert notifica-
tion system so that they re-
ceive text and voice notifi-
cations from the university. 
Updates to inputted SIO 
phone numbers are also up-
dated automatically with the 
emergency alert noti?cation 
system.
Oculus VR TOC table staffed by impersonators
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
News Editor
Many students received an 
email last week telling them 
that the people staf?ng the 
table for Oculus VR at the 
Technical Opportunities Con-
ference (TOC) were imper-
sonating recruiters.
According to the email 
sent by Senior Director of 
Strategic Programs and Spe-
cial Projects in the College of 
Engineering Kelly McQuoid, 
“We have reason to believe 
that the individuals at the 
Oculus VR table during the 
TOC were impersonating re-
cruiters. According to recruit-
ers at neighboring tables, 
these individuals left with a 
stack of résumés. We do not 
know if they will attempt to 
contact you.”
The TOC is sponsored by 
the College of Engineering 
and is organized by Carn-
egie Mellon’s student chap-
ter of the Society of Women 
Engineers. 
This year, over 300 com-
panies attended the TOC, 
making the normally two-
day event three days long. 
The TOC ran Mon., Sept. 17–
Wed. Sept. 19. Oculus VR was 
scheduled to attend the career 
fair on Wednesday.
Although Oculus VR did 
register to attend the TOC, 
McQuoid said in a separate 
email to The Tartan, the com-
pany later said it was unable to 
participate. “At some point,” 
McQuoid wrote in her email, 
“a few people stepped into the 
empty booth and started pos-
ing as recruiters.”
Recruiters at neighboring 
booths told McQuoid that the 
“recruiters” did not bring any 
signage other than what Carn-
egie Mellon provided and did 
not stay in the booth for very 
long. The impostors collected 
résumés from students and 
left with the résumés.
“It was reported to us that 
résumés were removed from 
the booth,” McQuoid told The 
Tartan. “Once this came to 
our attention, we began the 
process of notifying students, 
as well as identifying the indi-
viduals who perpetrated the 
prank.”
According to McQuoid, 
“The résumés have since been 
returned to me, and I will pass 
them along to Oculus VR,” 
and if students are “contacted 
by the company going for-
ward, those contacts should 
be viewed as legitimate.”
Oculus VR is known for 
producing Oculus Rift, a vir-
tual reality head-mounted 
display. The company was 
founded in 2012 and was ac-
quired by Facebook in March 
2014. Oculus VR, according 
to its website, is still looking 
for interns for the upcoming 
summer. 
Oculus VR was founded 
by Palmer Luckey, a “self-
described virtual reality en-
thusiast and hardware geek,” 
according to the company’s 
website. The company created 
the ?rst version of Oculus Rift 
with the help of a Kickstarter 
campaign that raised over 
$2.4 million from numerous 
backers.
“The TOC is designed to 
positively showcase the multi-
tude of mature, talented, and 
capable students on a profes-
sional level,” McQuoid wrote 
in her email to The Tartan. 
“We will evaluate our process 
and on-site security at the 
next TOC event to ensure that, 
even in a crowded venue, we 
have oversight to address is-
sues of this nature.”
The university is working 
to identify the impersonators.
“We have reason to believe that 
the individuals at the Oculus 
VR table during the TOC were 
impersonating recruiters. 
According to recruiters at 
neighboring tables, these 
individuals left with a stack of 
résumés. We do not know if they 
will attempt to contact you.”

Five Carnegie Mellon 
graduate students will be 
sharing the stories behind 
their research on Monday, 
Oct. 6 at the second collabor-
ative event between The Story 
Collider and Public Commu-
nication for Researchers. The 
Story Collider is a Boston-
based weekly podcast pro-
moting people’s experiences 
with science and exploring 
how science changed their 
lives or affected them person-
ally. Similarly, Public Com-
munication for Researchers 
is a student organization 
aiming to improve the pub-
lic’s perception and under-
standing of science through 
dialogue.
Titled “Reactions,” the 
show features ?ve graduate 
students from the College of 
Engineering, the School of 
Computer Science, and the 
Mellon College of Science. 
Casey Can?eld, an engineer-
ing and public policy Ph.D. 
student; Matineh Eyb Poosh, 
a civil and environmental 
engineering Ph.D. student; 
Vrushali Fangal, a compu-
tational biology master’s 
student; Adam Foote (MCS 
‘11); and Anvesh Komu-
ravelli, a computer science 
Ph.D. student; will be taking 
the stage. Audiences for the 
event should expect to hear 
narratives on subjects from 
sea urchins in a polar vortex 
to ?nding Wi-Fi at sea.
The Story Collider’s Senior 
Producer Erin Barker and 
Boston producer Ari Daniel 
Shapiro will be hosting “Re-
actions” at 8 p.m. on Oct. 
6 at the South Side’s Rex 
Theater.

Researcher explains why people endure uncomfortable situations for philanthropy
Christopher Olivola, as-
sistant professor of market-
ing in the Tepper School of 
Business, recently co-au-
thored a new study aiming to 
explain why people endure 
uncomfortable situations for 
the sake of giving. Olivola 
conducts research on human 
decision-making and behav-
ioral economics. The study, 
titled “The Martyrdom Ef-
fect: When Pain and Effort 
Increase Prosocial Contri-
butions.” was co-authored 
by Princeton University 
professor Eldar Sha?r and 
published by the Journal of 
Behavioral Decision Making.
Olivola described in a 
university press release 
that when someone forgoes 
comfort for a cause — for 
example, the recent ALS 
Ice Bucket Challenge — it 
strengthens the signi?cance 
of the charitable act. Run-
ning a marathon or other 
strenuous physical activi-
ties make the giver feel bet-
ter about their giving than 
donating cookies to a bake 
sale or donating money at a 
charity gala. Consequently, 
donations increase as the 
discomfort increases. Olivo-
la described this trend as the 
“Martyrdom Effect.”
“However,” Olivola said, 
“our experiments have also 
found this to be true only if 
the cause seeks to reduce hu-
man suffering, such as the 
dif?cult symptoms of ALS. 
In other words, dumping a 
bucket of ice water over your 
head to raise money for a 
local library or public park 
would not generate the same 
results. The ALS Ice Bucket 
Challenge successfully made 
that connection.”
Experiencing pain can 
cause charitable givers to be-
come more altruistic, Olivola 
said in the release.

Vice Provost for Design, 
Arts, and Technology and 
head of the Integrative De-
sign, Arts and Technology 
(IDeATe) program Thanas-
sis Rikakis spoke regarding 
the new program, noting 
the bene?ts of collaborative 
learning and how IDeATe can 
prepare students for entering 
new, creative industries. Rika-
kis said that there are now 35 
studio-based courses on top-
ics like game design and new 
markets for music. 
IDeATe already has over 
200 students participating and 
hopes to reach 500. Regarding 
the IDeATe facilities in Hunt, 
students have to take minis 
that teach students how to use 
the equipment in these areas 
before gaining access, and Ri-
kakis reported that he will look 
into whether students can use 
their printing quota for 3-D 
printing.
Discussion on funding Greek organizations
Following the tabling of 
an allocation request to grant 
$750 to the fraternity Sigma 
Phi Epsilon for their Labor 
Day barbecue, a discussion 
was held on whether funding 
should be provided to Greek 
organizations. 
The Joint Funding Com-
mittee (JFC), which allocates 
the pool of money generated 
by students’ activity fees, cur-
rently only provides funding 
to recognized student organi-
zations and not to fraternities 
or sororities because Greek 
organizations discriminate 
based on gender. However, 
there is no policy stating that 
Student Senate cannot fund 
unrecognized organizations, 
so a straw poll was held in 
which the majority of voting 
members were in favor of pro-
viding special allocations for 
unrecognized organizations 
but with certain restrictions.

“The current system that 
the school employs relies on 
the students’ trust in the ad-
ministration and trust that 
the investigations are based 
in the students’ best interest,” 
he said. “And after hearing 
stories from my friends and 
reading about Gabrielle in the

trust. It’s something each stu-
dent has to make a decision 
on and inform themselves

investigated.”
The speech took place dur-
ing a week when the Of?ce 
for Civil Rights (OCR) hosted 
Title IX focus group sessions 
on campus. 
The OCR conducted both 
group and individual sessions 
with campus members as part 
of a review of “the University’s 
policies and practices related 
to Title IX of the Education 
Amendments of 1972,” ac-
cording to an email sent to 
campus members by Casa-
legno. Focus group sessions 
and individual meetings were 
hosted from Wednesday to Fri-
day. Campus members were 
invited to various sessions 
based upon certain groups 
they af?liate themselves with, 
including but not limited to 
staff, faculty, resident assis-
tants, athletes, and male or fe-
male undergraduate students.
Title IX is a section of the 
1972 Education Amendments 
that prohibits sex discrimina-
tion in education. On May 1, 
the U.S. Department of Educa-
tion released a list of 55 colleg-
es and universities that it is cur-
rently investigating, including 
Carnegie Mellon, for possible 
mishandlings of sexual assault 
and related complaints. 
Other notable universities 
on the list include Princeton 
University, Pennsylvania State 
University, and Dartmouth 
College.

Smart headlights allow drivers to use high beams safely
CLAIRE GIANAKAS
Staffwriter
Nearly everyone has been 
told at some point in their 
life to drive safely. In today’s 
society, this reminder is often 
a warning about speeding or 
texting while driving. Despite 
the importance of these dan-
gers, though, many drivers are 
unaware of one of the biggest 
driving hazards — the dark. 
Robert Tamburo, a project sci-
entist in the Carnegie Mellon 
Robotics Institute, along with 
Srinivasa Narasimhan, an as-
sociate professor of robotics 
at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, are working to reduce this 
hazard by developing a smart 
headlight that allows drivers 
to use high beam headlights 
without blinding oncoming 
drivers.
Despite a severe decrease 
in traf?c, over 40 percent of 
all fatal car accidents occur 
at night. According to the Na-
tional Organizations for Youth 
Safety, driving at night is a top 
cause of car accidents due to 
the inability of the eye to re-
spond properly to switches 
between bright lights and 
darkness. The combination 
of bright headlights from on-
coming cars and surrounding 
darkness can cause drivers’ 
eyes to make continual adjust-
ments that impair vision.
Tamburo and Narasim-
han have developed a smart 
headlight that reduces the 
risk behind high beam head-
lights. “With our programma-
ble system.... we can actually 
make headlights that are even 
brighter than today’s without 
causing distractions for other 
drivers on the road,” Narasim-
han said in a university press 
release. The smart headlight 
is comprised of a Digital Light 
Processing (DLP) projector, 
as opposed to standard head-
lights, which are comprised of 
standard light bulbs or clus-
ters of LEDs. The DLP projec-
tor splits the light into a mil-
lion minuscule beams that can 
each be controlled indepen-
dently by a computer.
This increased control 
allows the headlight to rec-
ognize, track, and respond 
to oncoming cars as well as 
road signs and drops of pre-
cipitation. After sensing an 
object, the headlight can turn 
off small sections of the high 
beam to prevent glare; this 
includes blacking out the light 
that would shine into the eyes 
of oncoming drivers, as well 
as the light that would re?ect 
off precipitation back into the 
drivers’ eyes. In addition, the 
headlight can increase bright-
ness when bene?cial; for ex-
ample, upon the perception of 
street signs, traf?c lane lines, 
or moving objects on the side 
of the road.
Even with these changes 
in headlight brightness, the 
headlight intensity appears 
virtually unchanged to the 
driver due to the small size of 
the adjustment. The system 
latency — the time it takes for 
the projector to adjust illumi-
nation — is also small, falling 
between one and 2.5 millisec-
onds. By employing such quick 
alterations the headlight mini-
mizes visual distraction for the 
driver from variations in light 
intensity.
The smart headlight offers 
a new way to minimize the risk 
of nighttime driving, yet there 
is still work to be done. The 
current model of the headlight 
is larger than standard head-
lights, which limits its appli-
cation. At its current size, the 
headlight can only be used for 
larger vehicles such as trucks 
and buses, which are prone to 
glare. Future miniaturization 
of the headlight could lead to 
more widespread usage.

Tired of losing your apart-
ment keys, purse, and laptop? 
Need to ?nd them quickly as 
you’re rushing out your front 
door on the way to classes?
Tile, a simplistic square de-
vice created by a startup com-
pany founded by Nick Evans 
and Mike Farley, allows buyers 
to ?nd the things they attach 
the device to with the help of a 
phone app. A user  can attach 
the Tile, no bigger than a key, 
to almost anything. 
There’s a small hole in the 
top corner of the device to 
pull a string or chain through 
to secure it to any desired ob-
ject — as long as the user can 
get creative when trying to at-
tach the device to accessories 
without obvious attachment 
places, like a laptop or tablet.
But how does the square 
piece of technology help peo-
ple locate the things they lose?
Tile is essentially a Blue-
tooth-transmitting device that 
connects wirelessly to a phone 
to keep track of where a lost 
object is at a given moment. 
The device uses Bluetooth 4.0, 
which was ?rst introduced in 
cell phones in the iPhone 4S. 
Compared to previous Blue-
tooth technology, Bluetooth 
4.0 consumes very little en-
ergy, meaning devices do not 
waste as much battery. 
According to the device’s 
website, a Tile can last for 
about a year without the user 
needing to charge the battery. 
After that year, the website 
also states that the company 
will help users recycle their 
old Tiles and replace them 
with their most current model. 
The device works like this: 
Say your roommate borrows 
your laptop to do some work 
and moves to your dorm’s 
lounge. The Tile attached to 
the laptop will stay connected 
with your phone to show the 
movement of the portable 
computer as your roommate 
moves it into the lounge. Tiles 
have a Bluetooth radius of 
about 100 feet, meaning that 
the device will tell you the 
location of the object it is at-
tached to is as long as the Tile 
is in range. Of course, there are 
many factors that can disrupt 
or weaken a Bluetooth signal, 
including walls or other large 
barriers. If the Tile is not in 
range, the phone app can only 
tell the last location that it was 
able to pick up.
Tile also offers the option 
for users to ?nd items through 
Community Find. This feature 
allows other phones with the 
downloaded Tile app to pick 
up on a Tile’s location as long 
as the app is running. 
For example, someone else 
with the Tile app open on a 
61A headed to Giant Eagle will 
pick up the signal of the Tile 
attached to your wallet that 
you dropped earlier under the 
seat. Your own Tile app will 
let you know that someone 
else’s Tile app picked up on 
your lost object. The person 
whose Tile app picked up your 
device won’t be able to see the 
device’s location. Even if your 
Tile is out of range, it’s pos-
sible to get real-time updates 
about its location from other 
Tile users, who are, at the mo-
ment, slim compared to the 
number of cell phone users on 
the planet. This feature may 
need a larger base of users be-
fore it is actually a feasible way 
to ?nd objects out of range.
The app can support eight 
Tiles and contains a circular 
bar that shows users when 
they’re getting closer to their 
Tile. When they’re far away, the 
Tile’s signal will show up weak 
on the screen. But as users get 
closer to their lost objects, the 
app will show increased signal 
strength, meaning they’re get-
ting closer to their mark.
When users get close to the 
Tile, there’s an option to acti-
vate sound through a built-in 
speaker.
The device and its accom-
panying app works on phones 
running iOS7 or iOS8 on the 
iPhone 4S or later. Currently, 
there is no Tile app for An-
droid devices, although the 
website has an Android Engi-
neer job listing posted to its 
website.Braden Kelner/Editor-in-Chief

India becomes ?rst Asian nation to reach Mars
Although it is not the ?rst 
nation in the world to do so, 
India has managed to launch 
an orbiter to Mars, a task that 
only the United States, the So-
viet Union, and the European 
Space Agency have accom-
plished thus far. 
But unlike these entities, 
India has done so with a rela-
tively small budget of $74 mil-
lion. NASA, for example, spent 
$671 million in order for the 
Maven mission to succeed. 
In addition, the mission suc-
ceeded on the ?rst try, a feat 
unmatched by the U.S. and the 
Soviet Union.
The project was part of the 
Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) 
in the Indian Space Research 
Organisation. Named Man-
galyaan (or “Mars Craft” in 
Hindi), it will stay in elliptical 
orbit of Mars in order to map 
its surface and study its atmo-
sphere. It was ?rst announced 
in Aug. 12, and a little over 
two years later, the Mangaly-
aan had begun to orbit the red 
planet.

Scientists discover origin of water in our solar system
The origin of water has 
always been a mystery, but 
scientists have recently discov-
ered that most of the water in 
the solar system probably ex-
isted as ice that was formed in 
space. In order to learn where 
the water came from, scien-
tists focused their study on the 
water molecules themselves. 
By looking at the ratio of hy-
drogen to deuterium, an iso-
tope of hydrogen with about 
double the mass of hydrogen, 
they were able to determine 
under which conditions the 
water molecules formed. 
In the study, the research-
ers produced models with no 
external ice and tried to deter-
mine the amount of deuterium 
in ice that would be created 
over a million years. However, 
the models could not produce 
the same ratios of hydrogen 
to deuterium, which led sci-
entists to conclude that a sig-
ni?cant portion of the solar 
system’s water had come from 
outside the solar system, mak-
ing it older than the sun.

Telomerase can be controlled to turn cells on and off
Researchers at the Salk In-
stitute for Biological Studies, 
in La Jolla, Calif., have found 
a switch in cells that may con-
tain the secret to aging in cells. 
This switch could possibly 
turn a cell’s aging on and off 
at any time. This could pro-
mote healthy aging and cause 
healthy cells to keep dividing 
inde?nitely.
Most cells contain telo-
meres, a sequence of repeated 
nucleotides that protect the 
ends of chromosomes and act 
as a timekeeper of cells that 
shortens every time the cell 
splits. The telomere can be 
rebuilt by telomerase, which 
some cells possess. In the 
study, telomerase was found 
to be controllable — it could 
be turned off at any time. 
While the duplication of a 
cell goes on, telomerase dis-
assembles, then reassembles 
in the off state. This switch 
can help regulate cell growth, 
which has applications in 
cancer research.

Facebook to start testing Wi-Fi drones next year
As the tech giants are start-
ing to consider bringing Inter-
net to locations all over the 
world, Facebook is backing a 
drone-based project that could 
put Internet drones in the sky. 
The drone would beam Inter-
net access to people through a 
variety of methods. 
One method involves satel-
lite or free-space optical com-
munication (FSO) technology, 
which allows data to be trans-
mitted via invisible, infrared 
laser beams. 
The drones would be able 
to stay a?oat for months on 
end, even with the large de-
sign. The drones are currently 
as large as a Boeing 747, but 
much lighter. According to 
Facebook, the drones would 
have the weight of around four 
tires while being as long as ?ve 
cars. 
The solar powered drones 
would operate between 
60,000 and 90,000 feet. In 
addition, the drones can be 
either unmanned or have an 
operator.

Nanothreads made from benzene are thin, yet strong
Scientists have recently 
discovered how to create ex-
tremely thin wires made of 
diamond that are stronger and 
stiffer than any other existing 
nanotube or polymer. 
To create the diamond 
nanothreads, extremely high 
pressures were applied to ben-
zene, a chemical compound 
which consists of six carbon 
atoms in a ring with a hydro-
gen bonded to each carbon. 
Using a slow decrease in pres-
sure over time, a six millime-
ter-wide mass of benzene can 
be compressed into carbon 
tetrahedrons, which form the 
diamond nanothreads. The 
problem with this method, 
however, is the high pressures 
that are required for the reac-
tion to occur. Currently, such 
pressures are only limited to 
a few cubic millimeters, so 
these nanothreads are un-
feasible for mass production. 
Even so, these incredibly thin 
yet strong nanothreads would 
make the space elevator a 
possibility.

U.S. carbon emissions continue to increase
Although the Obama ad-
ministration has been at-
tempting to curb the growth of 
global warming, emissions of 
carbon dioxide have increased 
six percent over the last two 
years. This increase is a prob-
lem for President Obama, who 
touted the United States’ prog-
ress in reducing emissions 
earlier this year. The Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency 
(EPA), for example, proposed 
a 30-percent national cut on 
carbon emissions. Solar and 
wind energy are also used. 
However, coal use has fallen 
in favor of natural gas, which 
also traps heat and could con-
tribute to global warming. 
Crude oil production has also 
increased 31 percent, causing 
many greenhouse gases to be 
formed. At this rate, scientists 
estimate that temperatures 
could increase 5.8 to 9.7 de-
grees Fahrenheit by the end of 
the century.

Each year, robots play a 
larger role in the economy. 
Last week, self-driving cars 
won the right to drive on pub-
lic roads in California. Drones 
now play a signi?cant part in 
modern warfare. 
If you think professional 
jobs are immune from the 
encroachment of automa-
tion, then consider that stock 
trading is now performed by 
algorithms, Coursera offers 
university courses online, and 
IBM’s Watson is being applied 
to drug discovery. Companies 
such as Boston Dynamics, Re-
think Robotics, and iRobot are 
collaborating with universi-
ties to pioneer the role of ro-
botics in all aspects of society. 
In light of all this, Pugwash 
decided to discuss whether or 
not robots are making humans 
obsolete.
Increased automation can 
dramatically increase pro-
ductivity and is often wel-
comed by industry, as seen in 
the agriculture sector. How-
ever, today the increase in 
productivity does not imply 
increased employment — a 
trend typically enjoyed in the 
20th century. These changes 
can potentially cause signi?-
cant disruption to the labor 
forces of the economy. As 
Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew 
McAfee said in the 2011 book 
Race Against the Machine, new 
technologies are “encroaching 
into human skills in a way that 
is completely unprecedented.”
To increase employment 
rates, the unemployed must 
be trained to work in a dimin-
ishing pool of increasingly 
specialized jobs. The sluggish 
recovery from the global ?-
nancial crisis and record levels 
of university attendance are a 
strong indication that techno-
logical change is causing job 
losses to outstrip job creation. 
And the role of automated 
work in the economy is only 
going to increase.
Although economists are 
divided about how job cre-
ation will adapt to a more au-
tomated economy in the long 
term, in the near future an 
automated economy will be 
a major contributor to wealth 
inequality. We are already 
observing this consequence. 
When a small number of on-
line travel agents and tax 
preparation services can au-
tomatically do the job of many 
of?ce-based travel agents or 
tax branches, wealth that was 
distributed among many busi-
nesses and employees is fun-
neled into a select number of 
business owners who operate 
a more automated service. 
Likewise, when Walmart re-
places employees with auto-
mated checkouts, wealth that 
was previously distributed to 
workers is retained as greater 
pro?t. Evidence of this in-
creasing inequality can be 
seen in the stagnating median 
income, despite growing pro-
ductivity. Unreasonably large 
wealth inequality hollows out 
the middle class and is a cata-
lyst for the segregation of so-
ciety and social unrest. There-
fore, it is important to manage 
this challenge with appropri-
ate economic policy.
What happens when we 
take this to the logical ex-
treme? Imagine a utopia 
where all essential profession-
al, white collar, and low-skill 
jobs are largely automated 
by robots or software that is 
owned by a small number of 
organizations. Wealth is accu-
mulated through the economy 
without the need for wages to 
be paid to employees. Chang-
es in taxation laws would be 
necessary to support wide-
spread redundancy in this au-
tomated economy and allow 
the entire society to enjoy the 
fruits of an automated econ-
omy. Without these changes, 
we would expect large dispar-
ity between the owners of the 
technology and the remain-
ing population. The develop-
ment of major projects that 
occupy redundant citizens at 
an expense may become more 
commonplace if the increased 
wealth from the productive 
automated economy can be 
taxed appropriately. 
For instance, in the United 
States, large-scale govern-
ment projects, such as the 
military, currently provide 
employment for many who 
would struggle to ?nd work 
elsewhere.
In a world where humans 
no longer need to work to 
sustain their livelihood, what 
would people do with their 
time? An automated economy 
may see the rise of a parallel 
leisure economy, in which peo-
ple no longer need to spend 
their time working for an in-
come. Many people would be 
content to spend their time 
playing games, traveling, or 
working for enjoyment rather 
than necessity. However, one 
concern is that in the face of a 
catastrophic event where the 
arti?cial intelligence that hu-
mans rely on is incapacitated, 
civilization may totally col-
lapse, with society no longer 
having the means to operate 
in the absence of machines.
Such a utopian leisure 
economy would be contingent 
on a fair distribution of wealth 
among its citizens. However, 
this assumption is a very bold 
one to make. 
If we descend from our 
utopian fairytale, we may ?nd 
that those who own the tech-
nology enjoy the leisure econ-
omy that its wealth provides 
while the remaining populace 
is left with the crumbs, unable 
to compete with an economy 
of robots. Hopefully, if there 
comes a time when we must 
choose between these two sce-
narios, we will choose wisely.

CNAST receives gift

Carnegie Mellon’s Center 
for Nucleic Acids Science and 
Technology (CNAST) brings 
together researchers to form 
a multidisciplinary approach 
for developing synthetic 
nucleic acids that have the 
potential to aid in the diagno-
sis and treatment of various 
diseases. Recently, the center 
received a gift from the DSF 
Charitable Foundation for 
$3.1 million.
Bruce Armitage, profes-
sor of chemistry, biological 
sciences, and biomedical 
engineering and co-director 
of CNAST, explained that a 
large portion of the center’s 
research involves peptide nu-
cleic acids (PNAs), which are 
synthetic analogs to the DNA 
and RNA found within living 
organisms. Their similarity 
allows PNAs to bind to DNA 
and RNA in the cell, impact-
ing gene function.
In 2006, CNAST research-
er and Carnegie Mellon as-
sociate professor of chem-
istry Danith Ly developed 
a double-stranded form of 
PNA called Janus PNA. Ar-
mitage said that “research-
ers from around the world 
were intrigued and wanted 
a sample to use in their own 
experiments.” The research-
ers founded a biotech startup 
called PNA Innovations, Inc. 
to market the newly devel-
oped synthetic nucleic acid. 
Armitage added that “the 
new funding will enable Dr. 
Ly to further develop Janus 
PNAs and incorporate some 
of his newer ideas to improve 
the molecule.”
The DSF Charitable Foun-
dation’s goal is to promote 
excellence in the three pro-
gram areas of health, hu-
man services, and education. 
CNAST’s projects have the 
potential to develop tools for 
improving understanding of 
biological functions. After 
understanding the cause of 
complex diseases, the mol-
ecules developed by CNAST 
could be used to generate 
treatments for a plethora 
of diseases, such as Amyo-
trophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS), Parkinson’s Disease, 
and various cancers.
In addition to research, 
CNAST plays a large role in 
promoting excellence in edu-
cation. Armitage, referring 
to an educational outreach 
program called DNAzone, 
which targets K-12 students, 
explained that the program’s 
goal is to “expose students 
to the modern and exciting 
state-of-the-art aspects of 
nucleic science and foster 
their interest in science and 
mathematics.”
Armitage said that when 
he and another Carnegie 
Mellon professor, John Wool-
ford, started CNAST, their 
goal was to build a network 
of researchers. Many years 
later, CNAST has become a 
community of researchers at 
both Carnegie Mellon and 
the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center.

Last week the registrar an-
nounced the new schedule for all 
?nal exams which starts this semes-
ter. Previous ?nals weeks were orga-
nized so that exams were given the 
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and 
Friday of ?nals week. Exams were 
also given the following Monday, 
with make-up examinations on the 
following Tuesday.
While exams will still be given 
the Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, 
and Friday of ?nals week, Saturday 
has been made into a reading day 
with the last examination period be-
ing moved to Sunday and make-up 
exams given the following Monday. 
This change is bene?cial for stu-
dents wishing to get that extra day 
out of their vacation. This is par-
ticularly true for students with few 
exams, but who must wait until the 
second week of ?nal exams for the 
administration of their tests.
However, there is a major draw-
back to this shift, which has the po-
tential to affect a large portion of 
the student body. 
Students with a large number of 
?nal exams may feel the added pres-
sure of exams squeezed tighter into 
a shorter exam period. These stu-
dents will have fewer days between 
the ?rst and second round of exami-
nations to review a semester’s worth 
of material for classes on any given 
exam day. 
Though, ideally, studying for 
exams in the second phase of ?nals 
week should begin long before the 
weekend prior to the exam, this is 
not always feasible for students at 
Carnegie Mellon. 
Having the weekend before this 
second period can be a critical prep-
aration time for students swamped 
with exams. This is particularly true 
when one considers that many of 
the students with the largest num-
ber of ?nal exams, due to general 
education requirements, are ?rst-
years and sophomores who are still 
developing their time management 
skills.
The email from the registrar cit-
ed that the changes were made so 
that make-up exams could be more 
easily scheduled. While some peo-
ple will certainly bene?t from being 
able to leave a day earlier or having 
an easier time scheduling make-up 
exams, the change seems a small re-
ward from creating a stressful situa-
tion for other students.   
As ?nal exams near, The Tartan 
hopes the university will continue to 
monitor student feedback regarding 
the ?nal exam schedule change. De-
pendent upon feedback, the univer-
sity may wish to revisit the schedule 
for the 2016-17 academic year, for 
which the university has only re-
leased a tentative calendar, rather 
than a proposed (2015-16) or of?-
cial (2014-15) calendar.
New ?nals schedule bene?ts some but hurts more
Pittsburgh of?cials have added 
even more fuel to the ?re under the 
Uber and Lyft debate. On Thursday, 
two Public Utility Commission (PUC) 
administrative law judges recom-
mended against granting ride-shar-
ing company Uber permanent license 
to operate in parts of Pennsylvania.
The outcome stands to affect stu-
dents attending Pittsburgh schools, 
many of whom don’t own cars and 
rely almost exclusively on public tran-
sit to navigate the city. Uber and Lyft 
are popular services among students, 
as students view them to be more ac-
cessible and reliable than the city’s 
sporadic, often ?ckle taxi services.
The PUC judges cited Uber’s lack 
of transparency and apparent con-
cern for its patrons as the primary 
reason behind the decision. While 
Uber and its competitor Lyft could 
stand to be far more transparent in 
their data reporting — and would 
probably bene?t from this approach 
— Pittsburgh cab companies need to 
consider adopting and lobbying to le-
galize similar ride-share practices be-
fore shutting out Uber and Lyft com-
pletely. Uber and Lyft present a threat 
to the highly regulated taxi industry 
because their services are notoriously 
more accessible and reliable, largely 
due to their use of smart phone apps 
to match drivers with passengers and 
to facilitate payment. Furthermore, 
the available data indicates that 
Uber and Lyft are less discriminatory 
of patrons and better service poor 
areas, according to the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette.
Despite the public bene?t of these 
measures, existing regulations cause 
many ride-share practices to toe the 
line of legality. For one, Uber and Lyft 
are able to keep their fares low in part 
because their drivers do not need to 
maintain their vehicles or undergo 
training or background checks to the 
same extent as taxi drivers.
Reducing the rigor of training and 
background checks is not an easy 
course for cab companies to pursue, 
and for the public’s sake, maybe they 
shouldn’t try. But there are more le-
gal and practical ways in which taxi 
services can and should change their 
practices: improving accessibility of 
their services and eliminating dis-
criminatory passenger screenings.
Public outcry over the Uber and 
Lyft cease-and-desist measures have 
shown that the market isn’t going 
back: Cab companies and the gov-
ernment that regulates them cannot 
simply reverse the trend with legal 
roadblocks. Instead, taxi services 
need to recognize the new direction 
of transportation services and work 
within legal means to adjust their 
practices, while pushing the law to 
adapt. Rather than complaining that 
ride-share companies are deregulat-
ing the industry, taxi services need to 
?ght the more constricting and anti-
quated regulations that prevent them 
from competing.
This is not to say that ride-share 
companies are not without fault or 
exempt from the push for change. It is 
widely acknowledged that Uber and 
Lyft have engaged in less-than-trans-
parent dealings. In order to demon-
strate the concern for patrons that the 
PUC demands, ride-share companies 
need to share their data; It’s just hon-
est, good practice. Plus, the bene?ts 
of open data would likely outweigh 
the deterrents. It would offer pub-
licly accessible proof of ride-sharing 
as a superior and more just model of 
transportation service.
Both parties have work to do. Cab 
companies need to lobby for change, 
and ride-share companies need to 
be transparent about their practices. 
And in the public’s interest, the gov-
ernment needs to adapt regulations 
to changing times and institute man-
dates to demand data from ride-share 
companies to promote transparency 
and fair competition.
Ride-shares should be model for Pittsburgh cabs
If you’ve spent ?ve minutes on 
social media in the last week, there 
is no doubt that you have heard 
about Emma Watson’s HeForShe UN 
speech. The former Harry Potter star 
and current UN Women Goodwill 
Ambassador is launching what has 
been called a groundbreaking femi-
nist initiative. In Watson’s words, 
feminism has been for too long “syn-
onymous with man-hating” when, 
she says to men, “gender equality is 
your issue too.” Watson would like 
the HeForShe campaign to extend 
to all men a “formal invitation” to 
join forces with women in ?ghting 
for equality. Watson’s speech has 
resonated powerfully with millions 
— and for good reason — but how 
groundbreaking was it, really?
Watson has undeniably made a 
positive contribution to mainstream 
feminism. In a society where femi-
nism might as well be the new “f-
word,” every outspoken and proud 
feminist celebrity is valuable to the 
cause. A woman like Watson, mas-
sively famous and widely adored, 
carries such an astronomical level 
of clout that feminists everywhere 
should be thrilled to call her one of 
our own. 
Also, the HeForShe campaign is 
spot-on in challenging the miscon-
ception that feminism is purely a 
women’s issue. Gender equality is 
everyone’s issue, and Watson does 
a good job of recognizing and legiti-
mizing men’s issues without down-
playing those of women. The battle 
for gender equality is compromised 
when the sides are pitted against 
each other, she observes, so the so-
lution must be to stop useless ?ght-
ing between the sides and instead 
turn toward a common enemy — 
namely, gender-based stereotypes 
and policing. With her in?uence and 
her inclusivity, Watson may be able 
to rally many new feminists to the 
battlefront.
As encouraging as that is, Wat-
son’s brand of feminism must be 
taken with a grain of salt. Wealthy, 
well-educated, cisgendered, pre-
sumably heterosexual, and white, 
Watson is the epitome of privilege. 
Her arguments are exactly the sort 
which have dominated feminism 
in the public eye since its origins; 
her message, while valid and well-
spoken, is nothing new. Instead of 
traversing the same old ground, 
Watson would do better to use her 
in?uence to raise awareness of in-
tersectionality in feminism and to 
allow the voices of queer women, 
trans women, and women of color 
to be heard.
HeForShe tries to gently coax 
people toward feminist thinking, but 
— at least at this point — it seems 
to lack any sort of concrete plan for 
action. It’s all well and good to get a 
hashtag trending. It’s exponentially 
more valuable to actually take steps 
toward dismantling the oppressive 
power structures super-glued into 
society. The patriarchy does hurt 
men. Watson is all too correct on 
this point, though she neglects to 
mention darker issues, such as the 
belittling of male assault victims, 
circumcision at birth, and favoring 
of the mother in child custody cases.
Nevertheless, the patriarchy is 
also designed to keep men in power, 
and has consequently — historically 
and presently, across the world — 
resulted in the violent oppression of 
women far and above men. Gender 
equality is everyone’s issue. But pic-
ture a feminist who has read sexual 
assault and domestic abuse statistics, 
heard about the epidemic of genital 
mutilation and honor killings, seen 
politicians restrict body autonomy, 
and after all that needs Watson’s as-
surance that “this will bene?t men 
too” to buy into the cause. I hesitate 
to trust an ally who is indifferent to 
injustice until it becomes personally 
relevant.
It’s worth noting that despite 
Watson’s concentrated and admi-
rable efforts to make feminism ap-
peal to men, she still received a bar-
rage of anonymous 4chan messages 
that threatened — emptily, it was 
later revealed — to leak nude pho-
tographs of her. When even thor-
oughly inclusive feminism draws 
such threats, it becomes clear that 
misogyny has little to do with “fem-
inazis” and everything to do with a 
deeply-ingrained hatred of women.
Emma Watson is a real asset to 
the feminist movement. Hopefully, 
HeForShe will continue to inspire 
new feminists and encourage old 
ones while also integrating more 
practical efforts for change. Wat-
son’s brand of feminism is neither 
perfect nor groundbreaking, but in 
the end, I’m sure even Hermione 
Granger would admire her as an 
amazing young woman.

A PERSON’S OPINION
September 29, 2014 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
Compiled by Justin McGown
Externalities are the extra costs 
and bene?ts to a party that did not 
foresee them. Externalities may rep-
resent something very simple, but, 
on the grand scale of politics and 
international relations, they present 
a unique and systematic way of look-
ing at the UN’s recent talks regarding 
climate change. This year, some of 
the world’s largest polluters, namely 
the United States and China, have 
made key changes in environmental 
politics.
Domestically, President Barack 
Obama has been widely documented 
for ?exing his executive power, lead-
ing by example, and treading his own 
path. Although this behavior has 
been met with controversy, it seems 
as if he is willing to take the global 
community further into climate con-
versation. China, with new president 
Xi Jinping, has ?nally taken steps to 
clean up its own backyard, at a time 
when Beijing’s smog levels are reach-
ing hazardous and unbearable levels. 
This year, Xi Jinping and his cabinet 
formally “declared war on pollution,” 
according to Reuters. This declara-
tion comes after years of China calling 
itself a “developing economy,” which 
demanded a slackened restriction on 
emissions of greenhouse gases and 
other pollutants.
In the game of politics, it seems 
like most nations see proactive cli-
mate change policy as a competitive 
disadvantage, bringing with it extra 
taxes, less production, and more 
risky investments in research and 
development. One way externalities 
can be cut from the economy is to re-
align interests. The world needs this 
realignment regarding environmen-
tal economics. 
According to Columbia Univer-
sity Professor Scott Barnett, govern-
ments “keep coming up with ideas 
like pledges, which imply that you 
can, by some kind of central plan-
ning, ordain a collective outcome, 
and the world doesn’t work that 
way.” He also stated that the UN has 
“not found the means to change the 
incentives to get the countries to 
actually adopt limits, essentially on 
emissions.”
One way to realign environmen-
tal and political interests would be to 
create an independent body to fund 
research and development while 
monitoring the situation on a global 
scale. The result would be a coalition 
fund, made up of governments, busi-
nesses, ?nancial and development 
banks that are ready, according to 
the UN, to “mobilize up to $200 bil-
lion” toward environmental inter-
ests. The UN, in creating this coali-
tion fund, has built a new body that 
has interests different than those of 
an independent state or business.
Obama has also called upon 
himself, his cabinet, and the United 
States to lead the world in ?ghting 
climate change. Additionally, in his 
speech at the UN, he called on China 
to take on a greater role in the ?ght. 
China has already begun to ?ght pol-
lution on a domestic level, provid-
ing itself with a platform to join the 
United States in leading the effort to 
slow climate change. 
Both nations have wasted valu-
able time in squabbling over the 
“responsibility” of global climate 
change, but only now have they both 
adopted a direction in policy. More-
over, although some countries have 
already adopted signi?cant policies, 
like Switzerland and Singapore, the 
United States and China must start 
taking decisive action if there is to 
be any signi?cant action on a global 
scale, both because of the scale of 
their emissions and because they 
should serve as policy-examples for 
developing economies.
However, both the United States 
and China face signi?cant hurdles in 
getting the effort started. Despite cli-
mate change rallies drawing around 
400,000 supporters to New York, 
where the UN Climate Summit was 
being held last week, climate change 
remains an issue that does not par-
ticularly concern the majority of vot-
ers. CNN states that only 24 percent 
of Americans “list climate change as 
a national problem that they worry 
about ‘a great deal.’” Moreover, Chi-
na’s large, sprawling, and corrupt 
system of Communist Party of?cials 
suggests that any comprehensive, 
across-the-board climate change 
policy would be met with ineffective-
ness and inaction.
Ultimately, both countries are 
taking steps to change the game of 
environmental politics, but both also 
face further challenges in leading the 
charge against climate change.

“Don’t leave me here.” These are 
the words of a dying 91-year-old man 
named Joseph Andrey, featured in a 
recent article in The New York Times, 
who was forced by the American 
healthcare system to remain in a 
nursing home, despite the fact that he 
wished to return home and spend his 
?nal days with his books and music.
Andrey and numerous others are 
forced into nursing homes for their 
“best interest” in order to remain eli-
gible for Medicare coverage. Andrey 
could be provided with supervision 
and home visits from a private hos-
pice company if a doctor veri?ed that 
he only had six months to live, but, 
under the current system, he would 
lose all Medicaid home care.
Are these regulations really in the 
“best interests” of dying patients? 
According to The New York Times, 
the nursing home collected $682.48 
a day from Andrey, around ?ve 
times the cost of private home care. 
His daughter obtained records that 
showed the last year of his health-
care cost a hefty sum of over a mil-
lion dollars.
This is just one million of the $583 
billion spent last year on Medicare, a 
total that comprises 14 percent of the 
federal budget. Between 1969 and 
2012, Medicare spending per person 
grew at an average of 7.7 percent an-
nually according to the Kaiser Family 
Foundation. 
The costs of healthcare are sky-
rocketing in America, and there is 
no reason why we should be holding 
91-year-old patients as prisoners in 
the system, using American tax dol-
lars to pay their hospital bills and 
massively pro?ting the healthcare 
system.
If it was against Andrey’s will to 
keep him in a nursing home, why 
must he be kept against his will us-
ing the dollars of taxpayers?
Andrey receives no bene?t what-
soever from dying in a hospital bed. 
His last days would have been spent 
happier and at one-sixth of the cost 
to Americans in his own home. In 
Andrey’s eyes, “living” was spend-
ing his ?nal days at home enjoying 
his favorite books and music. Even 
if he was physically living, that does 
not mean that he was living happily 
while imprisoned in his own body in 
a nursing home.
People have the right to choose 
where to die; no one should take this 
from them. Now more than ever, the 
United States has forced the elderly 
to live and die in pain, attached to 
machines against their will. This is 
not the result of a system in their 
best interest. It is the result of a sys-
tem that, through the lobbying of 
nursing homes and hospitals, has 
chosen to favor pro?t over patient.

The Middle East is a desperately 
complex system of competing states 
and ethnic groups, and it doesn’t 
take much to send it into chaos. In 
the past week, the Islamic State of 
Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has caused a 
fresh surge of panic and confusion in 
the region, as its militants attacked 
— and continue to attack — Syrian 
villages along the northern-central 
border with tanks and heavy ar-
tillery, according to The New York 
Times. These attacks have sent new 
waves of Syrian refugees into sur-
rounding countries.
Of course, Syrian refugees ?ood-
ing into surrounding nations is hard-
ly surprising, given that more than 
3 million refugees have ?ed their 
nation since 2012, according to the 
United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees. The vast majority of 
them have gone to nearby nations, 
including Turkey, Lebanon, and 
Jordan. Others have gone to the Eu-
ropean Union, particularly to Swe-
den and Norway. While regarding 
Syrian refugees as a regional prob-
lem would be easier for the United 
States, Syrian refugees are a global 
issue. The in?ux of massive numbers 
of refugees stresses an unstable, vol-
atile regional system economically 
and socially.
First off, there’s a basic, uncom-
fortable dilemma: people are expen-
sive. Since the Syrian war began, 
500,000 refugees have sought asy-
lum in Jordan, costing the Jorda-
nian government over $800 million, 
according to Al-Jazeera, while Tur-
key has spent over $2 billion hosting 
refugees, according to IRIN News. 
Syrian refugees have cost the Leba-
nese economy around $7.5 billion, 
according to Reuters. 
To make matters worse, support-
ing refugees in Norway comes to 
$125,000 per person, per year, ac-
cording to The New York Times. It’s 
much cheaper to support refugees in 
the Middle East than in Europe, but 
it’s not as if the Norwegian govern-
ment can simply package up its tax 
dollars and send them to Jordan’s 
relief efforts.
Sending money directly to the 
source of the problem would be the 
ideal solution, but a glaring prob-
lem remains: the Middle East is 
notoriously unstable, and unstable 
systems often lack methods to en-
sure that humanitarian aid funds 
help the people they’re meant for. 
In fact, much of ISIS’s funding gets 
routed through front companies and 
regional charities, according to The 
New York Times. Sending money is 
a good solution in theory, but not a 
practical one.
To make matters worse, the ?ood 
of refugees presents a social prob-
lem in addition to the economic 
ones. Syrian refugees themselves 
present a mix of ethnic groups, some 
of which are ethnically Syrian, while 
some are Kurds. The Syrians ?eeing 
to Turkey in recent weeks are pri-
marily Kurdish. Sometimes refugees 
can assimilate well into the nation 
that hosts them, but sometimes they 
can’t. A major stumbling block to 
effective Syrian assimilation is the 
sheer number of people looking for 
asylum. 
The number of Syrian refugees 
in Lebanon currently exceeds one 
million, more than a third of their 
total population. Syrian refugees in 
Jordan are joined by 1.8 million Pal-
estinian and 450,000 Iraqi refugees, 
competing with native Jordanians in 
an economy with an unemployment 
rate of 12.6 percent, according to 
Sada. In short, the in?ux of Syrian 
refugees presents a major stress on 
the economies and societies of the 
surrounding area.
The social challenges presented 
by Syrian refugees have even less of 
a clear solution than the economic 
challenges, partially because they 
must be addressed on a case-by-case 
basis. A solution that might work in 
Lebanon might not work in Jordan. 
Even if the United States had an ef-
fective way to funnel funds into the 
region — which it doesn’t really — 
the problem of dealing with such 
large populations in desperate need 
of aid would remain. 
The Syrian refugee crisis is in-
deed a global crisis, but one that 
lacks a clear solution.

Systemic Risk 
and the 
Risk Management 
Paradox
by Paul Glasserman
FREE AND OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
After a 20-year drought 
full of losing seasons and 
laughable playoff hopes, the 
Pittsburgh Pirates have now 
posted a winning season and 
playoff berth for the second 
consecutive season. Having 
already clinched a playoff 
spot, the Pirates are spend-
ing the last few days of the 
season ?ghting for home ?eld 
advantage, either in the wild 
card game — where they have 
a one-game lead over the San 
Francisco Giants for the top 
wild card spot heading into 
Sunday — or the divisional 
round, where they sit one 
game behind the St. Louis 
Cardinals for the National 
League Central (NLC) crown. 
Ultimately, with a Pirates’ 
loss, and Giants’ and Cardi-
nals’ wins, Pittsburgh ended 
the year tied for the wildcard 
with the Giants, but will get 
home ?eld advantage in the 
Tuesday wild card game due 
to their head-to-head record, 
going 4–2 against San Fran-
cisco in the regular season.
Coming into this season, 
the Pirates’ playoff predic-
tions were mixed: the team 
is generally composed of the 
key players of last year’s luck-
reversing squad. Normally, re-
turning the same core after a 
playoff run would be cause for 
hope and optimism, but with 
glaring holes in both the line-
up and rotation left un?lled, it 
was highly questionable with 
a cast of young, rising all-stars 
and cheap, discarded veter-
ans.
One of the biggest con-
cerns was the power void at 
?rst base, which was ?lled by 
former Minnesota Twin Justin 
Morneau last season after an 
August trade. But with Mor-
neau signing with the Colora-
do Rockies in the off-season, 
the void was as present as 
ever. 
Originally, the front of?ce 
made a minor ?x by trading 
for discarded New York Mets 
prospect/bust Ike Davis, but 
Davis continued to be an all-
or-nothing hitter, with not 
much all and a whole lot of 
nothing.
Veteran Gaby Sanchez, 
who came into the season 
with at least a share of the 
starting ?rst base job, has 
been forced to play more than 
the fans and probably the Pi-
rates manager, Clint Hurdle, 
would have liked. Following 
a 2013 season where fans and 
the front of?ce were unhappy 
with his play, prompting the 
Morneau trade, Sanchez’s 
numbers have dropped like 
a rock, going from a .254 to 
.231 batting average. The 
eventual solution would have 
never been predicted going 
into the season, as no one saw 
the rise of utility player Josh 
Harrison coming. 
Starting the year in a pla-
toon split in right ?eld and 
biding time until super pros-
pect Gregory Polanco was 
called up from the minors in 
June, Harrison played himself 
into an all-star appearance 
with both his offensive and 
defensive abilities, regardless 
of his position on the ?eld.
When former all-star Pe-
dro Álvarez struggled both in 
the ?eld and at the plate, and 
spent some time on the dis-
abled list (DL), Harrison took 
over the starting role on third 
base. 
Álvarez slowly worked 
on the transition to ?rst base 
where he would be less of a 
defensive liability. Unfortu-
nately, Álvarez was diagnosed 
with a stress fracture in early 
September.
On the mound, the major 
question mark heading into 
the season was how to replace 
the production of former ace 
A. J. Burnett, who signed a 
high-priced contract with 
the Philadelphia Phillies in 
the off-season. The answer 
came in the form of Edinson 
Volquez, the former top pros-
pect of the Texas Rangers,who 
has bounced around the 
league and the minors as his 
command and effectiveness 
came and went. 
Thankfully, he was spot-on 
this year, leading Pittsburgh 
with 13 wins, a 3.04 earned 
runs average (ERA), and 140 
strikeouts.
Furthermore, last year’s 
ace Francisco Liriano found 
his groove in the second half 
of the year, ending up with a 
very solid 3.32 ERA. With all 
of these changes and Liria-
no’s performance, the Pirates 
pulled everything together at 
the right time. All-stars Rus-
sell Martin and Andrew Mc-
Cutchen have turned in ca-
reer-best seasons, keeping the 
team a?oat early in the year.
That being said, this team 
is not without major ques-
tion marks heading into post-
season. The formerly rock 
solid bullpen lost its mojo, 
prompting a desperate trade 
between the Pirates and the 
Los Angeles Angels in which 
they swapped failing closers: 
Jason Grilli from Pittsburgh 
to the Angels for Ernesto Fri-
eri. Frieri has imploded with 
the Pirates, posting an ERA 
over double what Grilli was at 
when the front of?ce gave up 
on him.
Also, after a hot and cold 
start, Polanco settled more on 
the cold side and has never 
lived up to the miracle worker 
potential bestowed upon him 
by the media. He still has 
plenty of time to grow into his 
potential, but the odds of him 
signi?cantly contributing to a 
playoff run in is slim.
No matter what happens 
in the playoffs, after 20 years 
without baseball in October, 
it’s a nice change of pace to 
not only be competitive but 
also make the playoffs in con-
secutive seasons. 
Who knows — maybe this 
is the start of a 20-year win-
ning streak for the Pirates.
‘Buctober’ returns as Pirates win
Women’s Tennis
As part of a three-day tour-
nament beginning Sept. 20, 
the Carnegie Mellon women’s 
tennis team participated in 
the USTA-ITA Southeast Re-
gional Women’s Tennis Cham-
pionships. Unlike the stan-
dard team format, each player 
or pair advances individually. 
On Sept. 20, the Tartans had 
four individuals advance on 
to the round of 16, in addition 
to two doubles pairs advanc-
ing to the quarter?nals.
On the singles side, senior 
Angela Pratt lived up to her 
second seed placement and 
won her ?rst two games in 
straight sets. Fellow senior 
Bryn Raschke and ?rst-year 
Cori Sidell followed suit by 
also deposing of their op-
ponents in straight sets. The 
fourth Tartan to move on, 
sophomore Nicholle Tor-
res, followed up by winning 
her next four sets across two 
games to move on.
Raschke also moved on in 
doubles, where she combined 
with ?rst-year Stacy Chang to 
cruise to Sunday after 8–2 and 
8–4 victories. The other pair 
to move on was juniors Abbey 
Hamstra and Brooke Tsu, who 
won their two matches 8–4 
and 8–1.
On Sunday, the seniors, 
Pratt and Raschke, proved 
resillent and pushed on to 
the semi?nals on the backs of 
two more straight set victories 
each. Unfortunately, Torres 
and Sidell fell in the round 
of 16, while Hamstra and Tsu 
made it all the way to the dou-
bles semi?nals before losing.
Whatever magic Pratt and 
Raschke had over the weekend 
wore out on Monday, when 
both fell victim to the same 
straight set of victories they 
had ridden to the semi?nals.
The Tartans will compete 
on Saturday versus Oberlin 
College at Carnegie Mellon.
Men’s Tennis
This weekend, the Carne-
gie Mellon men’s tennis team 
competed in the men’s USTA-
ITA Southeast Regional. The 
Tartans came into the tourna-
ment with six seeded players 
in singles play. Of those, four 
moved on to the round of 16. 
Senior Will Duncan took his 
?rst game. Junior Abhishek 
Alla, who was a two-seed, 
won his ?rst game in straight 
sets 6–1, 6–0 before pulling 
out to a 4–0 lead in the ?rst 
set of his next match, when 
his opponent retired due to 
injury. Sophomores Kunal 
Wadwani and Kenny Zheng 
both won their two games in 
straight sets.
In doubles play, Duncan 
and sophomore Jack Kasbeer, 
along with the pairing of se-
nior Bryce Beisswanger and 
junior Yuvraj Kumar, won 
their respective matches 8–1. 
The duo of Wadwani and ?rst-
year Andrew Pratt was forced 
to play two games, but still 
prevailed.
On Sunday, the individuals 
continued to represent Carne-
gie Mellon well:  Alla made it 
all the way to the semi?nals to 
make it to the ?nal four. Dun-
can and Zheng both moved on 
to the quarter?nals before ?-
nally dropping a match.
On the doubles side, Beiss-
wanger and Kumar contin-
ued to dominate to advance 
to the semi?nals on Monday. 
Pratt and Wadwani made it 
to the quarter?nals but ulti-
mately lost, ending end their 
tournament.
The semi?nals and ?-
nals for both individual and 
doubles will start on Monday 
morning.
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team travelled 
to Grove City College on Sat-
urday, trying to pick up their 
sixth win in the month of 
September. 
After multiple shots on 
goal by both teams at the be-
ginning of the game, Grove 
City got on the board ?rst 
with a cross into the box that 
beat senior goalkeeper Jacob 
Rice to the near post in the 
37th minute.
The Tartans took the 0–1 
de?cit into the half, but came 
out determined in the second 
half.
Carnegie Mellon eventu-
ally tied it up on a penalty kick 
in the 55th minute by junior 
mid?elder Connor Webb. 
The Tartans, and particularly 
Webb, kept pushing, includ-
ing back-to-back shots on goal 
by Webb six seconds apart in 
the 62nd minute.
Finally, in the 84th min-
ute, Webb and the Tartans 
prevailed as he knocked in 
his seventh goal of the sea-
son off an assist by junior 
forward and mid?elder Dimi-
trije Slavkovic to put Carnegie 
Mellon ahead for good, 2–1.
This win pushed the Tar-
tans to 6–3 going into Univer-
sity Athletic Association play, 
which begins Saturday at the 
University of Chicago.
Women’s Volleyball
On Sunday, the Carn-
egie Mellon volleyball team 
played a double header at 
Wooster, Ohio. In the ?rst 
game, against DePauw Uni-
versity, the Tartans took care 
of business, winning in three 
straight sets: 25–19, 25–23, 
25–21. First-year outside hit-
ter Heather Holton and senior 
right setter Ali Celentano led 
the attack, each racking up 12 
kills in the game.
In the second game against 
host Wooster, the Tartans 
looked just as sharp. Celen-
tano and Holton again led 
the team in kills with 11 and 
nine, respectively, and sopho-
more middle blocker Jackie 
Gibbons also stepped up her 
game. Sophomore defensive 
setter Molly Higgins was a key 
contributor on defense, get-
ting a team high of 11 digs.
The Tartans start UAA play 
on Saturday, playing their 
?rst round-robin at Emory 
University.

Carnegie Mellon on the board after 22–21 win in home opener
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Staffwriter
Despite struggling to move 
the ball offensively, Carnegie 
Mellon football came away 
with a 22–21 win Saturday 
over Geneva College in their 
home opener. 
After an opening touch-
down drive by Geneva left 
Carnegie Mellon looking up 
at the Golden Tornadoes, a 
combination of effective spe-
cial teams and suffocating de-
fense allowed Carnegie Mel-
lon to put up 22 unanswered 
points, a de?cit too large for 
Geneva’s comeback attempt to 
overcome. 
The win was the ?rst of 
Carnegie Mellon’s season, 
moving the team’s record for 
the year to 1–2.
The opening drive of the 
game did not yield auspicious 
beginnings for the Tartans. 
The opposing team success-
fully attacked the ?ats and 
put up consistent gains on 
catch-and-run plays. 
Geneva marched quickly 
down the ?eld and began 
the scoring when ?rst-year 
quarterback Aaron Channing 
hit senior wide receiver Josh 
Guiser for a 15-yard touch-
down. Carnegie Mellon did 
not respond well initially.
The Tartans’ ?rst drive of 
the game stalled after just six 
plays and 17 yards, but ?rst-
year punter Tyler Kohman 
dropped a perfect punt within 
Geneva’s ?ve-yard line, pin-
ning them with their backs 
against the wall for their next 
possession. The drive got no-
where due to an impenetrable  
defense by Carnegie Mellon. 
After a three-and-out, the 
Tartans took advantage of 
their excellent ?eld position 
on an 18-yard touchdown pass 
from junior quarterback An-
drew Hearon to senior wide 
receiver Tim Swanson. 
Both teams struggled to 
move the ball for the remain-
der of the half, trading punts 
until the break.
After a quick three-and-out 
by Carnegie Mellon to start 
the second half, Geneva set up 
a drive on their own 43-yard 
line, looking to take advantage 
of the ?eld position yielded by 
the Tartan’s failed possession 
of the ball. 
Four plays into the drive, 
however, junior outside line-
backer Nico Comsa got to 
Channing, forcing a fumble 
and setting up Carnegie Mel-
lon’s own offense with excel-
lent ?eld position. 
With some help in the form 
of two major penalties on Ge-
neva for 28 yards, Hearon hit 
sophomore wide receiver Gar-
rett Strobel with a surgically 
precise pass in the middle of 
the end zone, opening up a 
13-7 lead early in the second 
half after the extra point at-
tempt failed.
Both defenses continued 
to successfully prevent the of-
fenses from putting together 
any threatening drives. 
However, after a three-and-
out deep in their own terri-
tory, Carnegie Mellon punted 
the ball to Geneva, setting up 
the Golden Tornadoes at mid-
?eld with a chance to score for 
the lead. 
Geneva was putting togeth-
er a strong drive, and had got-
ten the offense all the way into 
the end zone before a pass was 
tipped, setting up junior cor-
nerback Vince Demarchi for 
an interception that he took 
to the house, giving Carnegie 
Mellon the ?rst multi-score 
lead of the game.
After a failed two-point 
conversion attempt, Carnegie 
Mellon was up 19–7, and the 
game would not be within one 
possession again until Geneva 
scored and completed a mean-
ingless two-point conversion 
with the game clock expired. 
Carnegie Mellon’s defense 
and kick coverage was strong 
for most of the game, with the 
?rst and last drives outliers 
during an otherwise very im-
pressive performance. 
First-year safety Drew 
Fitzmorris and junior cor-
nerback Ryan Aitken, in par-
ticular, were all over the ?eld, 
each ending up with 12 total 
tackles, with one each in the 
back?eld. Fitzmorris forced 
a fumble on special teams as 
well.
Swanson also had a very 
good home opener. He was 
Carnegie Mellon’s best weap-
on in the passing game, end-
ing up with 50 yards on four 
receptions for a touchdown.
“It was great,” he said of 
notching a win on the home 
?eld after two losses of a com-
bined 48 points to start the 
season. “It was a struggle the 
?rst two weeks, and now we’re 
able to come out on top. Our 
defense was able to propel us 
forward, and we were able to 
get the win.”
The win also comes on the 
heels of Swanson’s UAA Spe-
cial Teams Athlete of the Week 
award win after his return of 
a blocked extra point for a de-
fensive two-point conversion.
Carnegie Mellon football 
will look to continue their suc-
cess at home as they follow 
their conference schedule and 
host Westminster on Saturday 
at 1 p.m.

DESIREE XU
Business Manager
“It’s kind of an exercise 
that stimulates your mind 
and brain,” said Brandon Peck 
as he strolled across the Cut 
through the midday breeze 
toward the soccer ?eld, which 
acts as his main hangout spot 
on campus. 
The senior business admin-
istration and decision science 
double major plays for Carn-
egie Mellon’s men’s varsity 
soccer team and has been part 
of the team since his ?rst year 
at the university. When he is 
not burying his nose deeply in 
his textbooks or engaging in 
conversations with friends or 
classmates, he is dribbling soc-
cer balls with his teammates 
in ?ve-on-?ve short-sided 
games, his favorite drill. 
Though this drill is played 
in a space that is half the 
length of a standard ?eld, it 
does not fail to prepare this 
student athlete for intercol-
legiate tournaments, where 
he mainly plays right outside 
back defender and, occasion-
ally, mid?elder. Interestingly, 
Peck has played every position 
except goalie throughout his 
18 years of playing soccer.
What ?rst started out as 
a minor scrimmage during 
a YMCA activity for a three-
year-old Peck soon turned out 
to be one of the most reward-
ing and in?uential activities of 
his childhood. 
Peck said playing for the 
soccer team sometimes causes 
him a headache; practice re-
moves a generous portion of 
his leisure time. 
However, Peck is constantly 
reminded of the game’s nu-
merous charms that have 
motivated him to play for the 
last 18 years: its strategic na-
ture, team-oriented environ-
ment, and potential for build-
ing long-lasting friendships. 
As a matter of fact, some of 
his fondest memories in-
volve bonding with his team 
through shenanigans that oc-
curred during off campus road 
trips to tournaments at other 
universities.
“You get to know each 
member that much better 
when you’re away from the 
school setting,” Peck said. 
“It’s when we are away from 
all the pressure from classes 
and practice that people start 
to unwind, grow good-hu-
mored, and become immersed 
in conversations that seem 
to come out of nowhere, as 
well as goofy situations that 
tie us together. It gets quite 
exhilarating.”
During the last four years, 
his proudest moment was 
scoring his ?rst college goal 
in an NCAA tournament. Peck 
claimed that his most sig-
ni?cant accomplishment as a 
Carnegie Mellon athlete has 
been maintaining consistently 
high performances by exhibit-
ing polished techniques, uti-
lizing effective strategy, and 
promoting team camaraderie. 
When asked which profes-
sional team he would coach 
for one year if given the op-
portunity, he replied FC Bar-
celona, due to the passion that 
fans have for the team.
Others can clearly detect 
the reason behind his inter-
est: this defender relishes en-
vironments in which others 
give recognition and support, 
which is why he enjoys be-
ing a ?gure upon whom his 
teammates can depend during 
games as well as outside the 
world of soccer. This role also 
translates to his nonathletic 
relationships: friendships, 
peers, and family. 
The latter is most impor-
tant to Brandon, who said he 
has especially strong ties to his 
parents, who are his role mod-
els and the ones who initially 
encouraged him to play soccer 
for his physical, mental, and 
spiritual well-being.
“They both have done so 
much for me that I hope one 
day I can do for my children.”
Desiree Xu/Business Manager 
Brandon Peck, senior right outside defender and sometimes mid?elder for the men’s soccer team, says that soccer has allowed him to become a 
more balanced and relaxed student.

‘Paradise’ at The Frame
Junior ?ne arts majors display work at student-run gallery
“Paradise” is a word that means something different 
to everyone — it can conjure images of serene 
bliss, reckless violence, vast treasures, or simple 
pleasures. We often construct paradises in our 
minds, places where our inner thoughts and desires 
are set free and allowed to fulfill themselves. In 
“Paradise,” a display at The Frame gallery by junior 
fine arts majors Nicholas Sardo and Daniel Kim, 
this mental palace is brought into the real world. 
The artists use the walls of the gallery to create a 
paradise for their inner thoughts to roam free and 
express themselves.
“Paradise” is clearly influenced by street art; Kim, 
who handled the acrylic ink drawings said he draws 
much inspiration from rap music and hip-hop 
culture. Sardo also referenced this influence in his 
choice of spray paint as the medium for many of his 
contributions.
Many of the images are surreal, humorous, and, 
though there is no intended narrative, message-
laden. Sandcastles sprout hairy arms and legs, a Ku 
Klux Klan member sports robes bearing the middle 
finger, and four-eyed swans fly alongside four-eyed 
devils.
“We’re a generation that lives in our own heads a lot 
of the time, so we wanted to take those characters 
that live in our imaginations and set them free,” 
Sardo said.
The centerpiece of the work is Baffi, a large blue 
creature that snakes along the walls. Ruptures in his 
body suggest that the rest of the world is exploding 
out of him, ripping him apart in the process.
“All of these characters are original inventions for 
this show, although elements of them appear in 
some of my other work.… Baffi is an example of 
that; he’s a character I’ve been working with for a 
few years,” Sardo explained.
The two artists constructed the piece over the 
course of a week, bringing in a rough outline of 
how it would look but primarily allowing their 
creativity and feeling to determine the particulars. 
“We listened to a lot of My Chemical Romance,” Kim 
said.
Audience reactions at the show’s opening on Friday 
night were positive, with guests slowly walking 
around the room, inspecting each aspect of the 
incredibly rich world the artists had created on the 
wall.
“It’s exciting.… There’s a lot of movement 
happening in this piece, and it gives a lot of life to 
the show,” said junior fine arts major Carolina Vogt.
“Paradise” also incorporates the use of sculpture 
in a large, pink creature adorned with thick 
lips curled in a tight, menacing smile and what 
appears to be a string of intestines running out of 
the door. Furthermore, color is used sparesely and 
interestingly highlights some of the more disgusting 
elements of the piece, such as the slugs that adorn 
one wall.
All in all, “Paradise” is an immersive and 
imaginative experience that begs its visitors to 
look at the world around them with a fresh and 
interesting perspective. It will be on display at The 
Frame through next Sunday.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
I was waiting for the bus 
to get to Hofbrauhaus, 
and these two older guys 
in tattered clothes walked 
up. They started talking 
at me about restaurants 
that only let you in with a 
tie, about how poor we all 
are, and about how one of 
them is totally fine being 
poor        — that if money 
rained down on him from 
the heavens, he would 
leave it behind. Then the 
bus came, and he asked 
me for 50 cents, and I 
said no. Should I have 
said yes?

Rupees
Dear BEER MONGER,
You should have said yes.
He gave you valuable insight 
into the mind of a man who 
doesn’t give a crap about 
money, and that’s worth 
more than 50 cents. But 
paradoxically, he asked for 
the money — and for the 
somewhat odd amount of 
50 cents, not for a dollar or 
more. Maybe he had to pay 
for parking nearby? Probably 
not. But honestly, what could 
he have gotten for 50 cents? 
A gum ball? A sticker tattoo? 
Party blowers? A candy 
G-string?
Although, if you needed that 
50 cents to get your liter at 
Hofbrauhaus, then don’t 
even acknowledge the guy 
— beer is more important.
Or just buy some candy 
underwear,
Evan Kahn
Dear Evan,
I have this thing where 
I comment on women’s 
appearances to whoever 
is around to hear me. 
I make sure that the 
women can’t hear me, 
but I am frequently heard 
saying things like, “Girl’s 
ass is lookin’ fine in those 
… wait, are those shorts 
or pants?” and “I don’t 
remember her being that 
busty — is it a push-up 
bra? Her tank top?” I’m a 
gay man, so this is okay, 
right?

Dear OBSERVING,
Objectification is pretty 
looked down upon these 
days — but most everyone 
still does it. They just keep 
it to themselves. So, while 
I guess you not being 
attracted to women softens 
the issue a little, you still risk 
coming off as a douche if 
you verbalize it like that — 
especially because you’re 
gay. We shouldn’t talk about 
things we don’t understand.
But objectifying men is 
totally cool,
Evan Kahn

Ten Tonne Skeleton
Since Gene Simmons declared rock n’ 
roll dead, nobody wants to hear about the 
genre anymore. So take this column as 
my personal echo chamber.
British band Royal Blood is kick a**. A 
three word summary of their music would 
have to be “bassy riff rock.” They take 
the bassist/drummer lineup and use it to 
make music to dance to (and rightly so).
Check out their track “Ten Tonne 
Skeleton” from their self-titled (and 
?rst) album. It features a lead riff line 
reminiscent of CKY’s “96 Quite Bitter 
Beings,” a vocal melody that would 
please any fan of Muse’s album 
Supermassive Black Hole, and warm 
minimalist production. While listening to 
the track, my head bobs unless I make a 
conscious effort to avoid the action.
In listening to Royal Blood’s album, you 
tend to forget that Royal Blood is only 
comprised of two members. They sound 
so much larger. The only issue with the 
band is the lack of variety, but at this point 
in their career that’s ?ne with me.

New Leonard Cohen album
Good, but Popular Problems has its share of problems
Popular Problems, released on Sept. 22, is a low-key pop-
folk album by 80-year-old Leonard Cohen. Naturally, the 
album offers a few unique perspectives on life, coming 
from someone who, I want to reiterate, is 80 years old. 
The album has some good production, but issues such 
as inconsistently interesting sounds, genre archetypes, 
and odd instrumental decisions keep this album from 
being a great pop album.
The lyrical content here ranges from completely boring 
to rather insightful. On the song “Almost Like the 
Blues,” Cohen muses about life after death, singing in 
his characteristically gruff and sultry voice, “There is 
no God in heaven/ And there is no Hell below/ So says 
the great professor of all there is to know/ But I’ve had 
the invitation that a sinner can’t refuse/ And it’s almost 
like salvation; it’s almost like the blues.” The idea that 
there is no Heaven and Hell, except here on Earth, 
where Cohen gets his “salvation” from music, is rather 
interesting despite the cliché.
Cohen also has some remarkably poetic metaphors 
in songs like “Samson in New Orleans” and “Born in 
Chains.” They are a real treat to listen to orated in 
Cohen’s unique voice. Contrasting this with rather 
boring lyrics on “My Oh My,” “You Got Me Singing,” and 
“Slow” (literally about taking things slow), makes me 
wish Cohen had included more retrospection on the 
album.
The production is similarly spotty. Cohen uses 
electronic-keyboard bass lines and percussion 
(speci?cally a lot of cymbals), usually the same ones with 
some variation, on every song. Every song has a rather 
minimalist approach to its production, which works for 
some songs, but back?res on others.
On “Slow,” for example, the low-key bluesy keyboard 
backbeat works really well. But the piano and cymbals 
on a song like “Samson in New Orleans” is rather static 
and boring. Cohen accents his voice well when he adds 
some midrange, either in the form of non-electronic 
piano, guitar, or maracas, like in the songs  like “You Got 
Me Singing” and “Almost Like the Blues.”
You won’t ?nd anything remotely sonically challenging 
on this album. The blues beats are very archetypal and, 
a lot of times, aren’t all that interesting. Cohen also 
uses female backup singers on nearly every song, with 
varying ef?ciency. 
On “Slow,” the female singers rather sharply disrupt the 
feel of the song — the song is meant to be low key and, 
well... slow. Cohen’s low, gruff voice accomplishes this 
rather well: Having perfect-sounding high-range backup 
speakers come out of nowhere really disrupts the feel of 
the song. 
In the song “Nevermind,” however, the backup singers 
blend really well with Cohen’s voice. They work to 
accent it, and smoothly move underneath in the musical 
space. The foreign sounding chanting on that song also 
sounds pretty cool. On “Born in Chains,” the backup 
singers work to save what otherwise is a rather vanilla 
production, lending it a really nice gospel feel.
 
 
 
 
The album has some good production, and interesting
lyrics, but seldom on the same song. Suf?ce to say, 
Cohen has quite the consistency problem in his 
album. It’s a shame, because if all the pieces that 
Cohen demonstrates had come together in the right 
way, he would have had a hit album with some really 
great songs. As it is, though, the album is simply too 
inconsistent to warrant a universal recommendation.

The newest young adult dystopian literary sensation, 
The Maze Runner, is basically a hybrid of Lost, Lord of 
the Flies, and The Hunger Games that’s been adapted 
for the silver screen to win over the plethora of teenagers 
who are looking for a new hero to root for.
The Maze Runner is a pretty refreshing addition to the 
YA subgenre, but it ultimately seems to be lost in the 
crowded labyrinth of YA ?lm adaptations in which the 
mandatory plot must be fueled in a dystopian setting 
with an unwilling, oppressed hero.
The Maze Runner immediately thrusts viewers into the 
?lm in a dark, cramped cage with an amnesic youth 
named Thomas (Dylan O’Brien). He is offered up to a 
group of boys who inhabit a pasture called The Glade 
which is surrounded by an enormous Maze. 
The Gladers, as the boys call themselves, taunt Thomas 
while adapting him to their con?ned world. They, too, 
have similar memory loss and can only remember their 
names, which helps thicken the plot ever so slightly. 
Thomas is immediately intrigued by the Maze, but Gally 
(Will Poulter) adamantly shuts him down, saying only the 
Runners go through the Maze during the day as they try 
to ?nd an escape. 
During the night, they come back to the Glade, as 
the doors of the Maze slide shut and biomechanical 
arachnids called Grievers wander the Maze. This process 
has been going on for three years, during which the 
Runners have made futile attempts to ?nd an escape.
When ?ghting with Gally, Thomas slams his head on 
the ground and, instead of experiencing a bad migraine, 
he suddenly remembers his name and the crowd of 
boys cheer for him, even though they were jeering at 
him literally ten seconds before, as Thomas clearly lost 
the ?ght. At least Thomas has recovered a sliver of his 
identity. 
Fortunately, the ?lm doesn’t focus on Thomas trying 
to ?gure out his past. That part is covered through 
conveniently scattered ?ashbacks that are imbued in 
blue (for some reason, all ?ashbacks in dystopian movies 
seem to be in blue) in the form of Thomas’s dreams. 
Through these dreams, it’s revealed that he used to work 
for a corporation called W.C.K.D. which experimented 
on the Gladers. The mantra “W.C.K.D is good” is echoed 
repeatedly through the ?lm, propelling a hackneyed 
mystery that signals there is a bigger objective behind 
the Maze.
As mentioned before, Thomas doesn’t really care about 
who he once was. His main goal is to survive, which 
means going through the Maze, much to the opposition 
of Gally, who believes that it’s safer to inhabit the Glade 
and coexist with the Grievers.
Of course, Thomas goes through the Maze during the 
night and, having survived one night in the Maze, he 
inevitably disrupts the equilibrium that the Gladers 
have established. Soon, the need to escape the Glade 
becomes more urgent and Thomas takes the lead to 
venture into the Maze. 
Some parts are thrilling, while some fall ?at. We’ve seen 
many of these plot points time and time again.
As visual effects artist Wes Ball’s ?rst ?lm, The Maze 
Runner is a refreshingly visual ?lm that doesn’t get 
overwhelmed by CGI or unnecessary love triangles. 
Unfortunately, the last act of the ?lm is dedicated to 
setting up the premise of the sequel, which ends up 
being way more frustrating than satisfying. However, 
that seems to be a prerequisite in the hopes that they 
will skyrocket to franchise-level success. A seemingly 
necessary evil in the world of YA ?lm adaptations.

With fall now in full force, there is an onslaught of 
new shows premiering this week. Following are ?rst 
impressions (without spoilers) of six highly anticipated 
new shows airing this fall.
Madam Secretary
This new drama focuses on Elizabeth McCord (Téa 
Leoni), a self-righteous ex-CIA history professor cherry 
picked to be the Secretary of State. Lesson of the day: 
Don’t get on your history professor’s bad side. The show 
isn’t bad, but it isn’t great. Look for Madam Secretary on 
CBS, Sunday nights at 8 p.m.
Transparent
A comedic drama, this show documents how a family 
copes with their 68-year-old patriarchal father coming 
out as transgender. With Arrested Development’s 
George/Oscar Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) playing the lead, 
what more could you ask for? But for real, this show looks 
really fantastic. It’s de?nitely worth checking out. All 
episodes have been available for streaming on Amazon 
since Friday, and it could very well be Amazon’s ?rst hit.
Gotham
Gotham is an obvious attempt to attract fans of 
Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy and ABC’s Marvel’s 
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. It picks up what almost every 
Batman movie skips over: the portion of Bruce Wayne’s 
life in between his parents’ death and adulthood. But 
since it’s just plain stupid to have a television show 
revolve around a small boy, Gotham revolves around 
the cop trying to solve who killed the Batman-to-be’s 
parents. It’s just up to you to get over the myriad of 
over-the-top characters. Example 1: The dashing cop, 
Detective James Gordon (Ben McKenzie), who is on a 
mission for justice. Example 2: His law-bending partner, 
Detective Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue), who has good 
intentions but not the best execution. Example 3: The 
merciless and aggressive villain, Fish Mooney (Jada 
Pinkett Smith), whose web of alliances and sidekicks 
starts to crumble. Gotham airs on FOX Monday nights at 
8 p.m.
Black-ish
This new comedy is about an African American family 
living in the blindly white, af?uent suburbs of Los 
Angeles and racial tendencies in the 21st century. It’s 
basically a black comedian’s stand up routine, but rated 
PG. Within the ?rst episode, stereotypes such as African 
American’s inclination toward basketball and fried 
chicken are explored. With that being said, Black-ish has 
its chuckle moments and I would recommend checking 
it out. Black-ish airs on ABC Wednesday nights at 8:30 p.m.
How to Get Away With Murder
Take Scandal, turn it down a notch, add some Viola 
Davis, set it up in a law school, and you have How to 
Get Away With Murder. This mouthful of a show focuses 
on Annalise Keating (Davis), a law professor, and her 
rigorous class that pushes her students to extremes 
(hopefully) not exercised at Carnegie Mellon. I have a 
feeling this show will be around for a while (see: other 
Shonda Rhimes dramas on ABC), so I would recommend 
watching it. How to Get Away With Murder airs on ABC 
Thursday nights at 10 p.m.

New and promising fall TV shows premiere
From political dramas to Batman’s past, this fall has a variety of new shows kicking off
Meredith Newman| Junior Staffwriter
With a summer full of sequels, How to Train Your Dragon 2 shined as a lighthearted and moral-packed family-friendly blockbuster. 
The sequel picks up with the main lead, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) sans one leg, and his trusty dragon sidekick, Toothless. 
Like any good sequel, the audience can tell how Hiccup has transformed from a measly boy in How to Train Your Dragon to a 
con?dent 20-year-old man. Together, Hiccup and Toothless have to fend off a threatening herd (gaggle? group? school?) of dragons 
led by an ill-intentioned villain, Drago (Djimon Hounsou). Throughout the movie, the viewer is taken on an immersive adventure with 
the help of great cinematography, direction, and score. If only the Khaleesi had watched these ?lms, there would probably be less 
con?ict in the Game of Thrones world.

pillbox 09.29.14
Chicken is cheap. Chicken is delicious. It goes with 
almost everything; it can be fancy or no-frills; and 
generally, it’s pretty hard to mess up. Here are three 
levels of chicken: easy, less easy, and Jamie Oliver.
Easy: Chicken Parmesan
It’s a classic date night dish for a reason, okay? And 
one of those reasons happens to be that it’s easy as 
pie to make. The ingredients are truly simple and fairly 
inexpensive, but there are levels here, people. You can 
choose just to buy spaghetti sauce and pre-seasoned 
breadcrumbs or you can go hardcore and really, truly 
make it from scratch. It’s a personal choice. No judgment 
here.
Chicken breasts (try to buy the tenders at the store, 
but if the tenders aren’t there, you can just slice bigger 
breasts in half)
Flour
Breadcrumbs (pre-seasoned or homemade)
2 eggs, beaten in a bowl
One jar of spaghetti sauce (or your own gourmet version)
Olive oil
Slices of Parmesan cheese (or fresh mozzarella, which is 
my personal preference)
Salt, pepper, red pepper, and Italian seasoning
Spaghetti, cooked and drained
1) Start by heating the olive oil in a pan. Let it warm up 
while you work. Save time, eat better. 
2) Get out two small plates and one shallow bowl. On 
the plates, pour about one-third cup each of ?our and 
breadcrumbs. In the bowl, crack and beat the eggs. 
3) Use a fork to grab one of the pieces of chicken. First, 
coat it in ?our, then dip it in the egg, and ?nally coat it 
in breadcrumbs. I swear this is the hardest part. Repeat 
until all of the chicken is breaded, and then put it into 
the pan, where it’s going to cook quickly. Use a fork 
to turn it over so the breading cooks evenly. When the 
fork goes through the meat easily, it’s probably cooked. 
But! Because it’s chicken and can give you some nasty 
diseases if you eat it raw, make sure to cut at least one 
piece open and make sure that the meat is white all the 
way through — no pink spots and no pink juices. Season 
generously. 
4) When the chicken is cooked through, pour the 
spaghetti sauce on top. It should mix with the extra olive 
oil and start bubbling. Reduce the temperature and let 
everything stew for a bit. 
5) Put the slices of cheese on top of the chicken and 
sauce, then cover the pan and watch for the cheese to 
melt. If you’re cooking for a date or just feel like being 
fancy, pop that pan into the oven and broil it for ?ve 
minutes tops to get a nice crust on the cheese. Add 
some more Italian seasoning for aesthetic quality, and 
serve on top of a mountain of pasta. Mamma mia.
Less Easy: Chicken Aglio e Olio
While this recipe isn’t dreadfully dif?cult, it’s a step up 
from your basic chicken parm. There’s a de?nite level of 
sophistication in ?guring out how to time all of this so 
your pasta isn’t overcooked, your spices are just right, 
and everything is mixed in. I would recommend grilling 
the chicken that you plan to use, as it adds a nice smoky 
?avor that complements the garlic well. Alternatively, 
just lightly cook it in some oil in a hot pan. Good luck, 
soldier.
Chicken breasts, grilled and sliced (do ahead of time)
Fettuccini noodles
1 cube of chicken bullion 
Large bunch of fresh parsley
5-6 cloves of garlic
Portabella mushrooms, sliced
Plenty of olive oil
Salt, pepper, crushed red pepper ?akes, oregano
1) Start by cooking the pasta. Fact: most pasta takes 
about 12 to 13 minutes to soften to the perfect al dente. 
For this recipe, take it off of the stove at eight minutes, 
and drain all but two cups of the pasta water from the 
pan. Dissolve the chicken bullion in the remaining water. 
(I recommend in a glass measuring cup so you don’t 
burn/melt yourself/your Tupperware) Then turn the heat 
way down and let it simmer. 
2) While the pasta is cooking, you can be prepping other 
ingredients. If you tell your friends/families/girlfriend/
boyfriend this, it will make you sound like a MasterChef. 
True story. 
3) The chicken should de?nitely be grilled by now, so 
slice the breasts into long, thin slices. Set aside.
4) Peel the cloves of garlic and slice them into thin 
slivers. Set aside.
5) Clean your mushrooms (wash them well!), and then 
slice them into bite-sized pieces, depending on how big 
your mouth is. Set aside. (Are you running out of room in 
your kitchen yet?)
6) Take the bunch of parsley and chop the stems off. 
Throw them away, then go back to chopping away at the 
leaves, which, by this point, will smell amazing. Keep 
chopping until the knife stops making crunching sounds  
— this means that the leaves are all smaller, more edible 
sizes now.
7) Okay. Now that everything is prepped and cooked, it’s 
time to get ready to roll. Everything is about to happen in 
record speed, so pay attention and have at it. Godspeed.
A poultry pro?le: chicken, made three ways
Start with chicken parmesan and before you know it, you’ll be stuf?ng chicken left and right
To truly take your chicken parm to the next level, put it 
in the oven on broil for just a few minutes right before 
you serve it. The cheese will form a delicious, bubbly 
top and make your mouth water.

8) Pour a generous glug or two of olive oil into a pan and 
heat it. You’ll know it’s hot enough to move on when you 
?ick water into the oil and it freaks out and splutters all 
over the place. 
9) When the oil is heated, add the peppercorns, red 
pepper, oregano, and garlic. Let all of those sizzle for 
a few minutes but not too long. Burned spices are the 
opposite of fun. Throw the mushrooms in. Then, when 
those start to cook down (you can tell because they’ll be 
softer, smaller, and releasing juices), add the parsley.
10) By this time, you’ll have your pasta done and 
simmering. When you’re ready, pour the noodles and any 
remaining liquid in that pot into the pan you’re using. 
You might need to add more olive oil at this point to keep 
everything nice and coated.
11) Stir that around for a few minutes to let the ?avors 
mingle (I use tongs so I can boss that pasta around) and 
then add the chicken. 
12) Serve it up with some fresh parsley on top, and make 
sure everyone gets equal portions of pasta, mushrooms, 
and chicken. No one likes a biased chef.
Jamie Oliver: Super Fancy Stuffed Chicken
Poultry goes posh. Time to get real, people. This recipe 
is adapted from Jaime Oliver, and if you don’t know him, 
you should. He’s an adorable British chef with a fantastic 
YouTube channel and, clearly, a way with chicken. This 
recipe is not for the faint of heart. You have no place in 
level three super-fancy-stuffed-chicken-world if you’re 
not okay with pounding a chicken to make it thinner. 
Just saying.
Chicken breasts
18 oz. of portabella mushrooms diced into nice, small 
cubes
1 bunch of parsley (again)
Salt, pepper, and garlic powder
Olive oil
2 cloves of garlic, sliced thinly
2 cups of white wine
1 cup of Dijon mustard
1) Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.
2) To prepare your chicken breasts to be stuffed, you 
have to do a little work. This is all worth it, I promise. 
But don’t get squeamish on me, okay? Take a knife and, 
with the thinner end of the breast facing away from you, 
slice a vertical opening into the breast all the way. Make 
sure it’s deep enough to hold your ?lling but not so deep 
that it punctures the other side of the meat. You should 
be able to slide your ?ngers in but not see them poke 
through. Got that? Woo. Okay. Set your sliced chicken 
aside, and prep the stuf?ng.
3) Drizzle a generous serving of olive oil into a pan over 
medium to high heat and then add the mushrooms. 
Season the mushrooms to taste, then add the parsley. Let 
it all cook together, then, when the mushroom juices are 
released, set it aside to cool. 
4) While you’re waiting for it to cool, get a casserole dish 
or a baking pan for the oven and cover it with tinfoil for 
cooking your chicken.
5) Here comes the stuf?ng part: take the cooled 
mushrooms and parsley and jam it into the hole that you 
made in the chicken breasts. If it doesn’t completely 
close all the way, that’s okay. A little over?ow never hurt 
anyone. 
6) Put the chicken in a pan, and bake for about 40 
minutes, or until the juices run clear when you poke the 
chicken with a fork. You may want to cut into it with 
a knife just to make sure it’s done. Everyone’s oven is 
unique.
7) While the chicken is cooking, make the sauce. You 
can just use the same pan from before to save time on 
dishes. It’s all going to the same place, right? 
8) Sauté the garlic in olive oil and add salt and pepper. 
Don’t let it burn!
9) Add the white wine, and bring it to a boil. Let it cook 
for a while to reduce the alcohol. When the mixture has 
reduced to about two-thirds of its original volume, add 
the mustard and whisk the wine into the mustard. 
10) Let it cook for a few minutes, but not too long, 
because then your sauce will be thick and lumpy.
11) When your chicken and sauce are done, serve the 
chicken drizzled with the sauce and watch as mouths all 
around you drool, drop, and devour.

General Chicken Tips
Chicken isn’t high-grade salmon. This is a protein that 
needs to be cooked through and thoroughly checked to 
ensure that it’s not pink in the middle — because, you 
know, diseases and stuff.
Don’t let that scare you off though — chicken is my 
favorite thing to cook because there’s so much you 
can do with it. These are only three recipes of literally 
millions that you can ?nd online or in your favorite 
cookbook. 
Go crazy, and, as the Chick-Fil-A cows say: “Eat mor 
chikin”. 
Laura Scherb | Operations Manager
A nice, thick chicken breast will make for a beautiful dinner, but be careful to check that it’s done all the way 
through before you take it out of the oven. The only thing less impressive than take-out is undercooked poultry 
and the subsequent salmonella.

Whether it’s for the plot line, for our favorite actors and 
actresses, or for the sake of routine, we all have shows 
we tune in to regularly. In my case, it’s to check out the 
fashion worn by the characters on the show — I use it to 
inspire my wardrobe choices for the week.
Each TV show has its own characteristic style. At times 
this ?avor is so dynamic that the characters inspire 
fashion choices across the country. For example, when 
Gossip Girl ?rst aired, Blair Waldorf’s headbands took 
the country by storm. Department stores began to sell 
the preppy staple in a multitude of colors and patterns, 
ranging from polka dots to stripes to ?owers. The 
headband trend died down eventually, as most fashion 
fads do. However, for a lot of people, the headband 
remains a staple accessory. Just as many other trends 
have gained popularity through silver and small screen, 
the fashion in shows makes up a signi?cant part of pop 
culture.
Headbands weren’t the only thing in Gossip Girl to 
make waves in the fashion world when it was airing. 
The two main characters, Serena and Blair, presented 
styles that people immediately attempted to emulate. 
Although both are Upper East Side New Yorkers, they 
wear out?ts that are radically different. Yet, despite the 
incongruencies of their style choices, they act as perfect 
complements to one another. Serena’s almost Bohemian 
vibe offsets the “classiness” of Blair’s wardrobe, while 
Blair’s prim and proper fashion accents the “cool, barely-
trying” look Serena pulls off.
Blair is quintessentially preppy. Known not only for her 
headbands, Blair is also renowned for wearing bright 
colors — especially bright tights, girly dresses, and 
feminine skirts. If you want to get Blair’s look, shop at 
J. Crew: it’s the number one place to pick up all your 
preppy essentials.
Francesca’s Collections is also a great place to get 
Blair-like clothes. They sell a lot of blouses, which the 
character (or, actually, Gossip Girl’s costume designer) 
would pair with a nice skirt and heels or ballet ?ats. 
These ?ats are another style that Gossip Girl brought 
into the fashion world — they have been in style since 
the show’s premiere in 2007.
While Blair’s look is easy to describe, Serena’s style is a 
lot more nebulous. Serena, the other half of Gossip Girl’s 
dynamic fashion duo, is distinct for out?ts that are put 
together, yet maintain a de?nite Bohemian edge. Her 
primary staple is the leather jacket; she has a variety of 
these, all ranging in cut and color.
Not all of us can be characters on Gossip Girl with 
unlimited shopping funds; however, we can still emulate 
Serena’s style with one nice leather jacket paired with 
various out?ts. In episodes taking place during the 
summer, Serena wears bright and bold maxi dresses, 
paired with statement necklaces, of which she appears 
to be a fan. In almost every episode of the ?nal season, 
Serena wears a large necklace with her out?t. If you’re 
looking to imitate Serena’s style, Anthropologie is a great 
place to look for clothing and accessories like these.
Another show that offers style inspiration is New Girl. 
The show features its protagonists, Jess and Cece, 
wearing cool and collected styles. After watching an 
episode, I sometimes ?nd myself incorporating their 
style into my out?ts. Jess and Cece are people with 
completely different styles. Jess’s is quirky and indie 
while Cece keeps it cool and casual. If you want to dress 
like Jess, de?nitely check out Modcloth. Jess wears a 
lot of polka dots, sweaters with animals, and blouses 
with Peter Pan collars. While her style is somewhat 
conservative, it is undeniably cute. Cece’s style is on 
the other side of the spectrum and, therefore, easier 
to copy. She dresses casually: usually a T-shirt with an 
interesting cut or design paired with jeans. This kind of 
clothing can be found just about anywhere. Check out 
stores like Urban Out?tters for interestingly styled tees.
Yet another TV show that has made a huge impact with 
fashion is Pretty Little Liars. Aria, Spencer, Hanna, and 
Emily, the four main characters, are known for their 
own unique styles. The costume designer for the show, 
Mandi Line, has even speci?ed that her intention was 
to create styles that will make an impact and that other 
girls will want to follow.
Each character’s style has changed over the seasons. 
Aria’s starts out as edgy-Bohemian, then evolves to 
become quirky and bold. She pairs the sort of things that 
one would not expect to look good together, like ?orals 
with stripes, and ends up looking ?awless. In fact, it’s 
speculated that Aria may have been the source of the 
shorts-with-tights trend that came into style when the 
show started. To ?nd a style that’s bold and quirky like 
Aria’s, shop at Topshop and Urban Out?tters. Aria also 
loves accessorizing, so wear a lot of jewelry if you want 
to get her look!
Spencer’s style is preppy, but a lot more Victorian than 
Blair’s from Gossip Girl. Spencer rejects bright colors, 
opting for a darker, more muted color palette. Many of 
her clothes actually come from Urban Out?tters, so for 
some of her preppier or vintage items, this is the place 
to shop!
Hanna’s style used to be glamorous but has recently 
moved toward edgy. As of late, she’s wearing ripped 
tights, ripped shirts, and embraces gray, dark green, and 
black as her color scheme.
Finally, Emily has also amped up her style from the 
beginning of the series to now. Gone are the days of 
plain T-shirts and jeans; she’s moved on to sweaters and 
shirts that feature unique cuts. To dress like Emily, shop 
at edgy stores like All Saints.
As you can see, TV shows are a great source of fashion 
inspiration that you can use to put together your day-
to-day out?ts. If you’re ever feeling lackluster and bored 
with your wardrobe, turn on the tube; it’s the perfect 
place to get a fresh feel for fashion.
