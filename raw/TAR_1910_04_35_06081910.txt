Hard luck pursues us, Saturday at Grove City the 
varsity met defeat at the hands of the strong Grove 
City team. Grove City has only lost one game in 
twelve, but we made a very good showing
against them. With an even break of luck it would 
have been anybody’s game. Urkhard sprained his 
ankle before the game, but Wehr, who took his place, 
pitched a fine game. The final score was 5 — 0.

The great success and popularity attained by the 
Mho Club during this past year was crowned by the 
fruitful meeting at which the Plebes, whose earn­
est aspirations are of becoming electrical engineers, 
were taken into the club. After enumerating the pro­
ceedings of the club in the past, the aims and future 
proposals of the club were clearly and appropriately 
set forth for the benefit of the Plebe guests. And it 
was only after the meeting adjourned and the mem­
bers congregated in their club room that the real 
merriment became evident. It was indeed the oppor­
tunity for those, possessed of a witty disposition, to
take an active part in the evening’s entertainment. 
Various funny stories and songs interspersed with 
witty remarks sufficed to maintain those present in 
a happy mood. The various and eccentric styles of 
dress, with the luncheon, would indeed furnish ample 
food to be relished by our local cartoonists.
Prof. Wurts was greeted with the usual welcome 
and respect when he was presented to confer the 
honor, upon Mr. Culberstoy, of receiving the artistic 
cup. presented by Prof. Wurts for the best discussions 
at the meetings. Prof. Wurts also announced that 
Messrs. Wallace and Waxman are the selected mem­
bers to receive the prize given by the club for the 
best paper read at the meetings.
This occasion will certainly cling to the memories 
of those present and satisfy the aforenamed as an 
evening well spent.

With the cancellation of the game scheduled at 
Avalon June 4th because of scarlet fever epidemic at 
that place, the baseball season for Class ’13 team 
has closed.
Four games scheduled abroad with High School 
teams were cancelled for divers reasons. Greensburg, 
because of wet grounds; Union and Tarentum on ac­
count of their lacking funds; and lastly Avalon.
With exceedingly poor practice grounds and prac­
tically no outside assistance or attention given, an 
invincible nine could not be expected. However, it 
is generally accepted that the Freshmen team had a 
successful season. Seven games were played and of 
these, three were won, giving a higher average than 
some of the other school baseball teams can boast.
It would seem decidedly advantageous if Freshmen 
athletics were given aid and attention by the Schools 
Athletic Association. At present there seem no 
precedents, no system, to follow, and to have Fresh­
man athletics controlled in a haphazard way seems 
to make them considerable of a farce. Why not 
recognize athletics in the Plebe year, know­
ing that future varsity material may be thus de­
veloped and at the same time the athletic prowess of 
the schools upheld?
Having played in one-half or more of the games, 
the following men received suits with numerals — 
Saunders, Bailey, Middleman, Miller (manager), 
Baird (captain), Clements, Flick, Ross, Reyburn, 
Duff. W. R. Miller, Mgr.

The second annual joint concert of the Carnegie 
Tech Glee Club with the Pittsburgh Festival Or­
chestra will be held at the Hotel Schenley lawn on 
Wednesday evening, June 15th, 1910.
This is the last chance to hear the club this year 
and it affords a chance to hear the well known Festi­
val Orchestra all for fifty cents. Everyone should 
get a girl and bring her along, she will enjoy it. If 
you can’t find a girl see Gettman and he will get you 
one. Tickets may be had of all Glee Club members 
or at the store room.

The day after commencement, Mr. Haakon Styri 
will start for his home in Christiania, Norway. For 
the past year Mr. Styri has been taking a special 
course in Electro Chemistry. He sails from New
York on the French liner La Lorraine, and will spend 
several weeks in Paris. Being a reserve officer in 
the regular army of his country he expects to get 
back in time for the usual three weeks of field serv­
ice.
During his stay here he has made many friends 
by his desire to learn the “American Way.” In the 
chemistry department he has been a sort of king, 
both intellectually and physically. Many aspiring 
boxers, who have met him in friendly encounters, 
can vouch for the latter condition. In social circles 
he also has a record as champion whist and five- 
hundred player.
After a few years of practical work he expects to 
settle down as an instructor.

Commencement program was carried out for the 
twenty-sixth time at Case School of Applied Science, 
Cleveland, last week. Sixty-eight men received di­
plomas and degrees.
The speaker of the day was Dr. John A. Brashear, 
who warmed the hearts of the outgoing class by his 
cheery address and quaint humor.
Dr. Brashear spoke on “Some Footnotes from my 
Journal of Scientific Research” and explained some 
things of the scientist’s early career, his associations 
with Mr. Langley, the eminent astronomer and scien­
tist, and also reminiscences of such men as Keeler, 
Hall, Barnard and Roland. This was followed by an 
appeal to the graduates to be true to themselves, 
their Alma Mater and the world.
Dr. Brashear has won an enviable place in the 
hearts of Case men.

Relative to the higher education of women, Presi­
dent Taft spoke to the graduating class at Bryn 
Mawr, as follows:
It is suggested that the higher education of wo­
men rather unfits them to discharge the duties of a 
wife and mother,” said the President; “that in some 
way or other it robs them of charm and gives them 
an intellectual independence that is inconsistent with 
their being the best wives and mothers. I utterly dis­
sent from this view.
“The companionship of married life is the chief 
charm and reason for its being, so far as it relates 
to the two persons concerned. The enjoyment of the 
home, with children, and the training of them, are, of 
course, among the most important duties and pleas­
ures of married life, and it certainly does not detract 
from the power of a woman to make a good com­
panion or to teach and train her children to high 
ideals that she should have the advantage of the 
higher education.
“It is not essential that a woman who knows much 
conform to the unattractive manner and ways of the 
conventional blue stocking; that she should make the 
extent of her knowledge a source of discomfort to 
those with whom she associates, or that she should 
lose her interest in the sentiment and emotions of 
life, or fail to have an appreciation of beauty and 
romance*
“I am ready to concede that marriage and mother­
hood are a normal status for woman, and, other things 
being equal, she is happier in that condition than in 
any other. But this is far from saying that a woman’s 
life is a failure because she has not been married and 
that her life may not be a failure because she has 
been married.”
D1. V3Su8 ulIu1I3el8 C0uSe8I8.
On Friday evening, June 3rd, at their home on 
Douglass avenue, Dr. and Mrs. James entertained the 
students of the Department of Chemistry. The ma­
jority of the men of the Night and Day classes were 
present. The evening was very pleasantly passed at 
“500.” The fellows were in the best of spirits and 
all heartily joined in the game. Styri was the winner 
and for his victory received a very attractive book. 
And another member of the party received a bottle 
of “ketch up” as the reward of his efforts. During the 
latter part of the evening refreshments were served 
and the jollity of the occasion was at its climax. 
Texter made himself especially famous as a man of 
original wit. The kindness of the host and hostess 
will long be remembered by all who were present 
during the very enjoyable evening.
Steps are being taken by the faculty at Columbia 
to organize a student forum, for the expression of 
underground sentiment.

Grave Seniors in your robes of state,
The time has come to part,
And though we grieve 
To see you leave,
Some one must make a start.
The Seniors have had their last day of school 
with us and the ocassion was a sad one. Exer­
cises were held all during the’ day in honor of the 
departing family. They had their last assembly at 
nine o’clock. The Glee Club sang several ditties 
and the Senior class sang their farewell song at 
2.15. The class met in the assembly room to be 
addressed by Dean West and Director Hamerschlag. 
The Juniors were lined up at the door of the assem­
bly room on the first floor and the Plebes on the 
second floor. When the exercises were over the 
Seniors marched between the lines of their school 
mates and went to the little house. They were met 
by the Heads of the Departments, the Dean and Di­
rector. Here Miss Luretia Kemple presented the 
house with the table cloth made by the Juniors and 
Mrs. Martin of the Seniors presented the tablet of 
Mercury bearing Pandora. After this occasion, a re­
ception was held for the Seniors and Alumni.
There was a young maid from Oskosh, 
Who thought that to study was bosh;
She once had a quiz
And remarked, “O, gee whiz,
I wish I’d worked harder, by gosh.”

Tech has no monopoly on the “mumps” question. 
Ten cases of that affliction were reported at Alle­
gheny College last week.
Penn State is anticipating a Freshman Class for 
next wear, numbering 500.
A Chicago University professor claims to have 
isolated and held under observation a single ion 
or unit of electrical discharge for the first time.
The summer session of the University of Michigan 
is to have a newspaper of its own. The idea is to es­
tablished greater unity among the summer students.
Harvard and Amherst have both dropped basket 
ball as an intercollegiate sport.
The athletes at Northwestern are to receive “N” 
certificates, as well as the “N” itself.
A census of Dartmouth students taken recently 
shows that 40 per cent of the Freshman wear glass­
es, and the proportion increases through the classes 
above. Forty-eight per cent of the Sophomores, 
60 per cent of the Juniors and 76 per cent of the 
Seniors use glasses. The grand total for the whole 
college is 56 per cent.
Forty seniors at the University of Washington 
have secured positions as teachers in the high 
school, and will receive $85 salaries.
Members of the class of forestry at the University 
of Minnesota saved the Itasca State Park from total 
destruction by fire, by fighting the flames continually 
for 60 hours.
At the University of Washington co-eds are elig­
ible to wear the varsity “W” for excellence in the 
various branches of sport.
The Freshman of the University of Michigan re­
cently burned their gray caps amid great rejoicings.
A boxin tournament is being started at Leland 
Stanford University. Eighteen men have signed 
already, and ten more are expected in a few days.
Two thousand five hundred and thirty-five stud­
ents of Pennsylvania University engaged in athle­

“But I don’t see that you need be so heart-broken 
because Mabel Flyaway has jilted you.”
“It isn’t the jilting I mind, but she returned the

Considerable attention has been directed of late 
to the effect of sunlight on the transmission of Hert­
zian waves. A writer in Electrotechnische Zeit- 
schrift, in commenting on this subject, points out 
that the stronger the sunshine the less the con­
ductivity of ether to the Hertzian waves, so that it 
is incorrect to speak of a wireless telegraph station 
as having any definite range; for one which has a 
large radius of communication in northern latitudes 
would have a much smaller radius in the tropics. 
This would be particularly noticeable on vessels 
sailing north and south, and he suggests that it 
would be desirable to prepare a “radio-topographical” 
map, giving the relative conductivity of the ether at 
different latitudes.—Scientific American.
The dietary class of four had a luncheon last 
week in which they were thoroughly instructed in 
the art of carving. Miss Nickerson and Miss Cauble 
w:;re guests.
The Wisconsin physical examiner has discovered 
that according to statistics the “cribbers” are low

In the last 25 years Yale foot-ball teams have lost 
but 12 games out of 300 played. They have scored 
8,963 points to their opponents’ 425. Her highest 
score during this period was 130 to 0 against Wes­
leyan.
Scott, captain of the Stanford track team, broke 
the world’s record in the pole vault with a leap of 
12 feet 10 3-16 inches.
Minnesota has limited its attendance at the Sen­
ior Prom to 60 couples.
Purdue’s gala week is to have a unique program 
this year. A base-ball game, a campus picnic, band 
concerts and “The Romancers,” given by sylvan 
players, make up part of the week’s program.
A student committee of the University of Kansas 
will meet with the Governor of the State for a con­
ference on foot-ball.
There are more than four hundred co-educational

Nine athletes of Brown have been suspended from 
all participation in college athletes for the rest of

prohibiting the use of the word “Brown” in any ex­
hibition without the consent of the athletic board.

Once more we realize that our resources, our true 
resources of strength and of greatness, are not to 
be sought for in mine or field, but reside in man. 
When we take account of these resources, we find 
once more impressing upon us that we are not to look 
exclusively to the favored home of exceptional op­
portunity, to sheltered childhood, to youth blessed 
with extraordinary advantages, to those upon whom 
fortune has smiled and who are led along the paths 
of life with constant counsel and ready inspiration. 
But we must take all America within our view — the 
homes of the poor, the unfortunate, those who seem 
thrust aside from the fair avenues of opportunity, 
those upon whom it would seem a blight had rested 
at the very beginning of their career. Probably to­
day in some lowly home, where there is the hardest 
work to achieve even a decent support, where some 
little lad is looking out on life apparently without a 
chance, is the future leader of the great people of 
this nation.—Governor Hughes of New York in 
Leslie’s.

A conscientious Sunday school teacher had been 
endeavoring to impress upon hei' pupils the ultimate 
triumph of goodness over beauty. At the close of a 
story in which she flattered herself that this point 
had been well established she turned confidently to a 
10-year-old pupil and inquired: “And now, Alice, 
which would you rather be—beautiful or good?” 
“Well,” replied Alice, after a moment’s reflection, 
“I think I’d rather be beautiful—and repent.”—Lippin- 
cott’s.
.“Do you think that you can make my daughter 
happy?” asked Mr. Cumrox.
“She has been happy with you, hasn’t she?” rejoin­
ed the confident youth.
“I think so, sir.”
“Well, if she’s that easy to please, there ought to 
be no difficulty.”—Washington Star.

(With Apologies)
“Your lady waits within, my lord,
She waits within about 
A half a second.” Yet ’tis strange 
She also waits without.
Without her hat that sweeps a space, 
Wide as a comet’s tail;
Without the ceram rubbed on her face, 
Without her gloves and veil;
Without her dress hooked up behind, 
Without her broach and rings,
Without her hair in rolls entwined,
And countless other things.
Gadzooks! The hours fly on like sand: 
“My lord will please remain 
A second more; its her command.”
The silence, grows, profane.

Wake! for the Son has startled into flight,
The bull pup with a vase, and still is full of fight;
And swinging the house cat by the tail, he strikes 
The Nursery like a bomb of Dynamite.
II
Before a shower of spits and yowls had died 
Me thought a voice within the nursery cried;
“Sic her! Towser sic, her; tactach her tail,
Old doggie, and see if oo can make her slide.”
III
Oh worried Pups; Oh Cats that still survive,
One thing at least is certain; that the Kid’s alive;
One thing is certain and the rest is Noise 
That all our.thoughts to chaos seems to drive.
IV
A pile of picture blocks upon the floor,
A Hobby Horse, a gun and Drums galore,
A rubber ball, a Horn to split the Air;
A Wilderness wert Paradise, and More.
V
It seems forsoothe he’s neither Here nor There, 
Yet from the Din it seems he’s Everywhere.
What boots it that the China falls to Whence 
Without the Kid, the day would be Despair.

Idle seniors, the Hippodrome and Junior finals 
make a combination hard to beat.
Professor Thayer landed the only “job” offered 
to the Civil Seniors.
Freddie Stevenson has business which marks 
him as a special senior.
“And you’d better get scarce at once if you 
Would care to go in peace 
Or I’ll spit you on a prominence 
And let you fr yto grease.”
So the giddy one shot to outer space,
Where ethics are rather crude 
To tell of the frost he lately received 
From a chesty sun and his brood.

Miss Nettie A. Lang is said to be the only woman

each car before it is allowed to leave the garage.

A visitor bold rode all alone 
Across the azure sky,
And flaunted his tail in old Sol’s face 
As he friskily gambled by.
He threw a wink at the star of Love,
As serene in her beauty she rolled,
Then tried to flirt with mother earth,
But was met wifti glances cold.
He refused to salute the God of war,
But flung his rockets free,
He kicked meteor dust in Mercury’s eyes 
As before him he capered in glee.
The planets assembled in solemn conclave 
With Sol on the Judgment seat,
And the comet was tried for Les Majesty.
But he bawled them out in style that cut: 
“Your a bunch of loafers,” said he,
“You may cavort around a ten cent sun,
But you’re all too slow for me.”
Old Sol grew hot beneath the gills,
His gorge was rising fast:
“Your mighty fresh for a comet,” said he, 
“That has such a shady past.”
With the feather duster banished by the march 
of sanitary science, the theatrical trust will be hard 
hit in the matter of soubrettes.—Chicago News.
