Attacks and Destruction 
Cause Crisis at C-MU
It is happening here. About a month ago, the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh faced a grave problem in the increased num­
ber of attacks by off-campus persons on students and the de­
struction of university property. Now it is all moving up the 
street and C-MU is facing the same crisis.
HEW Plans To Investigate
Construction Co.
Last Thursday night three male 
students were attacked individual­
ly at three different locations. 
The attacks occurred between 
1 a.m. and 2 a.m. outside the 
library, on the corner of Forbes 
Avenue and Margaret Morrison 
Street and in front of Skibo. One 
of the students had to be treat­
ed in the hospital.
It is thought that the same peo­
ple attacked all three students.
At the same time Thursday 
night, approximately eight bullet 
holes were shot through the win­
dows of the Skibo ballroom facing 
the patio. Nobody, as yet, has 
been apprehended for the shoot­
ing.
In addition, as reported last 
week in the Tartan, three non­
students were arrested by the 
City Narcotics Squad in Skibo 
for the possession of marijuana.
Several acts of vandalism have 
also plagued the campus in the 
past week. Two doors have been 
kicked in and destroyed in Skibo. 
Also, two clocks have been 
stolen out of the new study 
rooms in the basement of Skibo. 
A window was broken in the Tar­
tan Grill by someone throwing 
an apple.
Two exhibits in the Skibo Lobby 
have been defaced in recent weeks. 
The first, an exhibit of photo-
The Pitt News, on strike for 
two weeks, resumed publica­
tion Oct. 13 after winning de­
mands of $9,000 in staff salaries, 
a journalism seminar for academ­
ic credit, and over $4,000 addit­
ional cash for printing costs.
The crisis occurred when the 
Student Government cut the news­
paper budget by $17,000, more than 
half of the $39,000 they had ask­
ed for, and merit scholarships were 
dropped for staff members.
“It’s just not fun anymore when 
you spend 80 hours a week up 
here and get didley.” said Sports
graphs about the march on 
Black Monday, was ripped down. 
Anti-war material, put up by the 
Moratorium Committee for 
October 15, was stolen twice 
from the lobby.
“I just can’t believe that stuff 
was stolen by a student,” one 
member of the Committee said.
In an effort to prevent the van­
dalism and danger to personal saf­
ety, an additional security officer 
has been assigned to the front of 
Skibo. He will try to identify 
those who belong on the cam­
pus and those who are not mem­
bers of the campus community. 
Those who do not belong will be 
asked to leave University prop­
erty.
All students are being reques­
ted to carry their Identification 
cards with them at all times. This 
request applies especially to fe­
male students who often do not 
carry pocket books.
It is thought that perhaps one 
reason for the increased vandal­
ism is the tightening and increase 
of security at the University of 
Pittsburgh. Perhaps this has for­
ced the vandalism to move out 
here,” Mr. McCurdy said.
There will also be increased 
security activity within Skibo in 
an effort to control the users of 
the buildings.
Editor Jerry Gruebel. The $9,
000 will be divided up to pay for 
the editors and business staff tu­
itions as well as for some repor­
ters’ stories. This, the News feels, 
will improve the paper “qualita­
tively and quantitatively.”
Students will also receive one 
credit each semester for work­
ing on the Pitt News and parti­
cipating in a journalism semin­
ar. Staff morale, however, still 
remains a problem “You really 
wonder who cares if the paper 
ever comes out again,” said Edi­
tor David Tiernan.
Graziano
The problem of equal employ­
ment in the construction indus­
try, expecially as it relates to 
C-MU, has not died.
Vice President Richard Stra- 
thmeyer has sent a strong letter 
to the Graziano Construction Com­
pany. in charge of the Com­
puter Research Building. The 
letter (Printed here in its en­
tirety ) reads as follows :
“Dear Mr. Graziano:
On Monday, September 29, 
1969, I met with you to review 
the effects of our student de­
monstration of September 23, 
1969, and to state and to com­
ment on Carnegie-Mellon Univer­
sity policies regarding equal em­
ployment opportunity as applied 
to our construction contracts. 
Attached hereto is a state­
ment made by President Stever at 
noon on September 23, 1969,
setting forth four specific ac­
tions. The first three of these 
are of immediate impor­
tance to you in the conduct of 
your present contract with 
C-MU.
At this time I am not apprais­
ed of the action contemplated by 
President Nixon nor the U. S. 
Attorney General. However, a com- 
plicance inspection team of the 
Department of Health, Educa­
tion and Welfare has been re­
quested to conduct a com­
pliance review of your firm and 
such subcontractors as you may 
be employing. This team is in 
Pittsburgh and may be expected 
by you momentarily. The deter­
mination of any necessary remed­
ial action required to bring your 
activities into compliance with 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 and regulations pertain­
ing thereto, including the 
specific provisions of your contract 
with CMU, will await the find­
ings of the HEW Compliance 
Team.
On September 18, 1969, Mr. 
Roger L. Schmidt, my Superin­
tendent of Engineering, wrote to 
you requesting certian informa­
tion concerning the employ­
ment policies and practices of your 
company. Your response to this 
request and the information dis­
closed therein will be studied care­
fully by us and, where necessary 
to our full understanding, will 
be reviewed with you. We shall 
also ask you to identify ways by 
which you can improve any situa­
tion which represents only token 
or nominal employment of non­
whites on our project. We shall 
also be studying such possibili­
ties, including any which might 
require renegotiation of our ex­
isting contract.
We at Carnegie-Mellon Uni­
versity appreciate your fine work 
on our projects as well as the co­
operation which has characteriz­
ed our working together. It is re­
prehensible that the construc­
tion industry in Pittsburgh has 
not moved with more aggress­
iveness and effectiveness in the 
area of equal employment oppor­
tunity. As a member and a lead­
er in the industry, it is impera­
tive that you now make bold 
moves to bring about necessary 
and desirable changes. You 
no longer can ignore what is pub­
lic policy. Our institution is 
committed both in policy and 
practice to equal employment op­
portunity. We expect our con­
tractors and vendors to give evi­
dence of the same.”
At a Faculty Senate meeting 
(Oct. 14) Mr. Strathmeyer read 
the letter. He explained that it is 
incumbent on the prime con­
tractors to enforce compliance 
practices on sub-contractors. In 
addition, he said that there are 
two parts to a compliance inspec­
tion.
First, the HEW inspection 
team checks on the affirmative 
action program of the contrac­
tor. An HEW inspection team was 
in Pittsburgh on September 23. 
was checking contractors here, 
and had on their list the C-MU 
contractors. However. Mr. Strath­
meyer reported, they were called 
out of Pittsburgh and he does 
not yet know if they completed 
their work here before leaving.
The second part of the com­
pliance review involves the inspec­
tion of the number of people ac­
tually employed by the unions 
and in what categories. This is 
done by the primary granting 
agency (in C-MU’s case, this 
means NSF and HUD.) In any 
case, either of the agencies 
may ask HEW to also do this 
inspection for them because the 
latter seem to be better equipped 
to fulfill this kind of function.
At the same Faculty Senate 
meeting. Dr. Kibbee presented a 
summary of the actions taken by 
the Committee of Nine. Dr. Kib­
bee noted that the original pur­
pose of the Committee had been 
to explore possible attitudes the 
University could take toward the 
construction crisis, and especially 
the development of new policies 
for future contracts. He further 
noted that the Committee's func­
tions had been somewhat redirec­
ted during the crisis presented 
by the student-faculty demon­
stration. The Committee met last 
October 10 to review the pro­
gress made by the University in 
implementing the actions promis­
ed by President Stever in his let­
ter to the campus community 
September 23.
No response to the telegrams 
sent to President Nixon and At- 
torney-General Mitchell by Presi­
dent Stever has been received 
by the administration. The Com­
mittee of Nine has suggested 
that there should be a follow-up 
to these telegrams through conver­
sation with and telegrams to 
Pennsylvania Senators and Con­
gressmen.
In addition. The Committee 
asked the University’s attorney to
make a thorough study of the pre­
sent C-MU contracts and to re­
port back to the committee on 
all the possibilities of renego­
tiation. There exist two possibili­
ties for action in this area: (1) if 
the contract were found to be in 
non-compliance, this would give 
the University some leverage in 
renegotiating their contract, and 
(2) there is a possibility that with 
University funds or perhaps fed­
eral funds — could use jobs for 
training programs.
In regard to new University 
policies on Discrimination for 
use in future contracts, the Com­
mittee recommended that meetings 
be set up with the following peo­
ple or groups to acquire informa­
tion on compliance standards:
(a) The Mayor’s Committee on 
Human Relations. This Committee 
acts as an approving agent on 
compliance regulations for all 
construction by the city and does 
the same on request for the Pitts­
burgh School Board on contracts 
over a specified amount. In 
recent weeks, the Committee has 
determined that no contracts that 
it has investigated have met ap­
proved compliance standards. For 
this reason, all school and city 
construction projects have been 
postponed. The Mayor’s Commit­
tee will be asked by C-MU re­
presentatives about standards to 
use in judging compliance.
(b) The Cleveland Office of the 
Office of Federal Contracts 
Compliance has worked with 
Case Western Reserve and other 
Cleveland universities to set up 
university regulations on com­
pliance.
The Director of the Philadel­
phia Office of OFCEE has also in­
dicated his willingness to work 
with us on this problem. It was 
also suggested that the Univer­
sity of Washington be contacted 
since they have made progress in 
developing new regulations and 
might be another source of infor­
mation.
Discussion among the faculty 
followed the report. Professor 
Schumacher said that he was 
very pleased with the progress 
as evidenced in the report.
A meeting of all local univer­
sity college presidents in Wash­
ington with the Pennsylvania con­
gressional delegation which might 
be an effective lobby as a follow 
through to the telegrams sent to 
Nixon and Mitchell, was suggest­
ed by Professor Fox.
Mr. Kerr also proposed that C- 
MU join the Friends of the Black 
Coalition in creating pressure 
to help the BCC obtain an in­
terview with the Attorney Gen­
eral of the United States.
The discussion closed with a 
report from Mr. Strathmeyer saying 
that he is preparing to issue a re­
port on the affirmative action 
program at C-MU whereby em-

EditorialLETTERS TO THE EDITOR
There is an added problem which has crept up in the 
past week. There is a distinct, real threat to personal saf­
ety on campus.
The bullet holes in the Skibo ballroom are proof that cer­
tain persons in the community Dossess guns — and desire to 
use them. It is just lucky that a janitor was not behind the 
curtain sweeping the ballroom floor at the time of the shoot­
ing. We could have had a disaster on the campus.
The three males attacked Thursday night are further 
proof that the violence in the City is not removed from our 
isolated ivory tower. It is important to note the locations of 
the attacks. Two were on the main campus property. The 
third was in an area which boasts an apartment of primarily 
female students who often come and go at all hours of the 
night.
These attacks have made it clear that individuals cannot 
function as carelessly as they have in the past. All students 
must be made aware of the fact that to venture out alone at 
night is to put oneself in a potentially dangerous situation. 
Males and females should not walk anywhere alone. If you are 
returning from the library, going out to get a newspaper or 
down to Oakland for a pizza be sure to find someone to ac­
company you.
We support efforts to limit the use of campus property. 
But it is primarily up to individuals to take all precautions to 
protect their own safety.
Further, in light of the increased number of attacks, we 
recommend that the Security budget be significantly in­
creased in order to boost the size of the security force. The 
present force cannot possibly adequately patrol the Car­
negie-Mellon campus.
It is no long a question of whether you do or do not like 
high school “hippies.” Now the question is whether you believe 
that personal safety and property must be protected to the best 
of the University’s ability.
Last year, when the Skibo policies were instituted to 
restrict the use of the building to administrators, faculty, stu­
dents and their guests, debate raged on campus as to whether 
the University has a responsibility to the community to pro­
vide facilities for off-campus citizens. When it was mentioned 
that not only were these high-school students offensive to 
many on-campus persons, but that often property was vandal­
ized apparently by some of them, the dissenters wanted proof.
Although no specific proof could be given at that time, 
now it is evident for all to see. Most of those who have a vested 
interest in the University in terms of jobs or payed tuition, agree 
that in order for the University to function, it must maintain 
buildings and other facilities in which to conduct the educa­
tional process. Few would want to destroy these investments. 
Not only does destruction hamper the conduction of the univer­
sity’s primary responsibility, but realistically speaking, we 
must pay for them. If windows are continually broken and 
doors destroyed, then the money to repair them will eventual­
ly come out of higher tuition. We all agree that we do not 
need or want a rise in all-ready too high costs.
If we therefore establish that members of the campus 
community have not been the vandals in the past week, who 
are we to assume did the damage. Perhaps, we can safely 
say that off-campus persons were the offenders. If that is the 
case, we must institute efforts to restrict their presence on 
campus.

Stever Lies?
Dear C-MU:
Once again the administration 
is playing its games of lie and 
stall with us. Last month, faced 
with massive faculty and stu­
dent pressure, the administration 
agreed to support the BCC’s 
“demands for equal and appro­
priate membership, employ­
ment and representation of blacks 
in trade unions” and adopted sev­
eral resolutions to that end. A 
committee was formed to check 
on construction and internal hir­
ing practices of the university.
Bullshit, Dr. Stever!
1. What response was there to 
the telegram sent to the PRESI— 
dent and Attorney General re­
questing that suit be brought 
against the unions? Any? Or 
was tat telegram even sent at 
all?
2. What results came of the 
federal compliance review of 
the construction projects here? 
Or was there no review?
3. What progress has been made 
in the attempt to renegotiate our 
present contracts? Or has that at­
tempt not been made.
4. How are we doing in develop­
ing new contract standards? 
Orare we at all?
5. That Committee was to re­
port October 1. It is now Octo­
ber 18. Where is that report?
We students are now demand­
ing a voice in the University. 
Do we deserve it when we sim­
ply allow the administration to lie 
to us? We felt strongly enough 
about these issues to demonstrate 
for them. The Demonstration is 
over but the issues are not set­
tled. Will we allow this to hap­
pen? Can we allow this to 
happen?

Poor Direction
Editor, The Tartan:
Recently some students and 
faculty of the New College of Hu­
manities and Social Sciences have 
been meeting in efforts to im­
prove and revise the college. 
As H & SS is new and still in 
the formative stages, the idea be­
hind their efforts is very admir­
able and indeed necessary. But, 
upon examining the direction of 
these people are taking, I must 
assume that their purpose is not 
to suggest constructive criticism, 
but merely to cause controversy 
and establish themselves as a 
group of liberal “free-thinkers.”
Students in H & SS have been 
given several questionnaires 
which explain and ask opinions 
on some of the proposals of this 
committee. One of these propos­
als is a suggested coeducational 
physical education class which 
would include such worthwile 
activities as frisbee and nature 
hikes. Is this truly an attempt at 
improving the college?
Another, more disturbing pro­
posal is that of a House in the 
Country Learning - Experience 
Course. This would be a country 
for independent study and “ex­
perience,” a somewhat nebulous 
term. It seems to me that it would 
be difficult to carry on valuable 
independent study without the 
benefit of books and other pri­
mary sources. This suggestion is 
apparantly an attempt to find 
an acceptable substitute for sum­
mer camp.
As a student in H & SS. I am 
disturbed about the apparent 
goals of those working to “im­
prove’’ the New College. These 
people should step back and see
if they are truly trying to make 
H & SS a good college for ALL 
students. On the surface they are 
appraently only trying to satis­
fy their own peculiar whim.

Save MMCC
Editor, The Tartan:
I might as well start out by 
saying that I am a M.M.C.C. 
student who is feeling pretty 
lousy at the moment. Three is 
an awfully good chance that the 
college will soon be down in the 
books as a thing of the past. 
How can they do this without 
giving students a chance to fight 
back to save it?
MMCC has so-called “Home- 
Ec” programs — not cooking and 
sewing but chemistry. They do 
not have easy “girl” classes — 
they are scientific and techni­
cal — just like the rest of the 
school. Very few schools in the 
country can offer such a program 
with such varied options as does 
MMCC. And now it is even too 
late to try and help recruit 
new freshmen and let them know 
how great an experience it is. 
If the program was not good — 
we would not have attended 
meetings today to try to avoid 
this type of ending.
Just sign me
One of the last at MMCC
Upset Maggies
Editor, The Tartan
As members of MMCC we are 
very upset over the discontinua­
tion of the College for the 
Following reasons:
1) Although we have been re­
assured of receiving the proper 
education, we feel that the de­
terioration of the department, 
while we are still attending, is 
inevitable. While new, improved 
equipment will be provided for a 
college which will be non-exis­
tent in four years? We know of 
the denial of a greenhouse to 
the biology department after the 
discontinuation of the depart­
ment.
2) We feel that the discontinu­
ation of MMCC will be a disser­
vice to Pittsburgh since the col­
lege is the only Home Economics 
education center in the city. Home 
Economics is an important field 
for today and the future and must 
continue to grow to serve the 
nation in the fields of clothing, 
food and education.
3. MMCC definitely has a 
place within the confines of a 
technical school due to its tech­
nical nature. The studies of food, 
textiles and clothing, and educa­
tion are integrated with the 
fields of chemistry, research 
psychology, and sociology. Fur­
thermore, the location of MMCC 
within a technical school and a 
large city whose industries are 
involved with the fields offer­
ed by MMCC has a definite ad­
vantage over the Home Econo­
mics Departments located within 
the confines of small town, uni­
versity settings.
Because of the significance of 
the above reasons for retaining 
MMCC we refuse to condone 
that the closing of the college 
without fighting for its preserva­
tion.

We Protest
Editor. The Tartan:
We regret the charges that one 
of our colleagues has made 
against our department and our 
college (Tartan, October 14). 
When we are maligned before 
the campus community, we feel 
that we must protest.
We do believe in what we are 
doing: in literature and in com­
munication as humanizing forces 
and in ourselves, however im­
perfect we may be, as their spokes­
men. We believe in our responsi­
bility, boty academic and per­
sonal, to our students. Our col­
league implies that we are not 
humane because our modes of op­
eration are different from his. 
When we do not know about the 
integrity of a colleague, we do 
not call it into question. We re­
sent therefore an uniformed 
judgment of ours. We feel that 
our forum is the classroom and 
the academic and social relation­
ships we have with students and 
that channels of orderly poli­
tical expression still remain open; 
our forum is not, has never been, 
and we assume never will be 
the streets. Far from apologizing, 
we are proud to be members of 
College of Humanities and So­
cial Sciences.

Muskie Says 
Agnew Goofed
Commenting on Vice Presi­
dent Agnew’s remarks about the 
Moratorium, Senator Edmund 
Mu«kie of Main said that Mr. 
Agnew had rendered “a disser­
vice to the country and to the 
President.”
Mr. Muskie termed the mora­
torium “an outpouring of concern­
ed Americans trying to contri­
bute in a constructive way to the 
shape of our policy.”
If the President and Vice 
President “had responded in a 
positive way. they might have be­
come not its target but a part of 
it,” Mr. Muskie said.

At the time that this is being written, it appears that the biggest 
complaint so far by H & SS is on the road to being fixed: i.e., the ab­
olition of core requirements and the institution of area requirements. 
The only other problem, an H & SS Lounge, and H & SS Public Rela­
tions, is under scrutiny by this author.
OK; so everything’s copascetic. H&SS Has no need to grip; or 
better still, has nothing to be really incensed about.

H&SS Conference on Cities
But while I was considering 
H & SS’ PRs, I started to ask 
myself, what is an H & SS stu­
dent, what does he look like? 
Everybody has a stereotyped 
C.I.T. student. He’s a Typical 
American Boy with short hair, 
button-down shirt, “slacks,” 
and penny-loafers (hiking shoes 
optional). He has a mechanical 
pencil stuck over one ear, twelve 
calculus books under one arm, 
and a T-square or slide rule under 
the other. Then there’s the Fine 
Arts student. He has long hair 
(beard or moustache optional), 
a generally dishevelled (that’s the 
nicest word I could think of) 
appearance with jeans and scuffed 
up shoes an Absolute Necessity. 
He’s generally seen freaking-out 
over a leaf blowing in the wind 
or something. Of course, I know 
there are exceptions to each rule, 
but fess up; you really DO have 
C.I.T. and F.A. students stereo­
typed deep down inside of you.
But what do H&SS students 
look like? What clothed do 
they wear? Where do they go? 
Well, No. 1, if you see an H&SS 
student close up, you might be 
incluned to stare because it 
is a distinct rarity on campus. 
H & SS students generally blend 
into the overall campus scene be­
cause their dress is the Best of 
C.I.T. with some F.A. on the side. 
Don’t walk up to an H & SS 
student with a question because
they won’t be satisfied that 
They’ve given you a satisfac­
tory answer until they’ve deliver­
ed into every facet of the ques­
tion. This is an informative if 
slightly time-consuming process.
H & SS students are mostly 
female (yay!) And for the most 
part are Psychology Majors; (I’m 
the only English Major I know 
of. If there are nay more, wear 
a sign or something so I know 
you when I see you). So watch 
what you say when you speak to 
one because he may be a would- 
be Freud or somebody.
But anyway, you can’t really 
analog an H & SS student. He’s 
too amorphous, anonymous, and 
cosmopolitan for that. If I have 
my way, you’ll be hearing a lot 
from H & SS in the near future.
Watch this school for further 
developments.

Last spring Irving Bartlett, 
head of the History Department, 
and Erwin Steinberg, Dean of 
H & SS, met with a group of re­
search associates from C-MU’s 
History and English depart­
ments. The topic under investi­
gation was the foundation of a 
Humanities Institute at Car- 
negie-Mellon. Such an Institute, 
it was hoped, would be able 
tow work with the new School 
of Urban and Public Affairs in 
coordinating a humanistic context 
of working and learning with the 
fields of architecture, business 
and engineering. Since, however, 
SUPA is not yet a fully opera­
tive department, the Humanities 
Institute has not yet had an oppor­
tunity to function in this role.
In the report prepared last sem­
ester by Bartlett, Steinberg, et 
als, another project in connec­
tion with the Humanities Insti­
tute was laid out. The plans made 
then will come to fruition this 
week end, when a conference on 
“The Role of Humanities in Ur­
ban Affairs” will be held here. 
The Conference will be held on 
Thursday and Friday, October 
23 and 24. Details jre listed 
below as to time, meeting place, 
topic and speaker. It is obvious 
by the rather important looking 
roster, that the Conference has 
drawn many scholars and men of 
note to our campus for discus­
sion of a very meaningful 
concern: the city, how it grows 
and functions. It is hoped that 
further dialogue will grow out of 
this weekend experience that 
will aid the educators on our own 
campus to find definite direc­
tion for the Humanities Institute, 
SUPA, and the new H & SS Col­
lege, while each is still in an 
embroynic stage.

unabridged.
Unabridged — that’s the kind of Europe we give you. 
Involvement with the total culture: talking, 
listening, meeting, sharing.
Sure, you’ll get the sights, the beaches, and some swinging 
parties —and you’ll enjoy them. But then, anybody can 
give you those. We give you the facts behind the sights, the 
reasons behind the events. And we do it through the people.
We dish up the real Europe —from the mod up-beat action 
of Carnaby Street to the philosophical intensity of 
the Left Bank.
You get the agony and the ecstasy; action and involvement. 
Because that’s what Europe is all about.

'The Three-Ring Circus Called Journalism'
by JAMIE EDLIN
Journalism, I’ve been told, is a three-ring circus. A 
friend, a “real, live” journalist who has “journalized” in 
London, England and the West Coast of the U. S., and I 
drew many conclusions on the art of media production. On 
the right we have the Straight and Narrow Press; Hyper­
drab. On the left we have the Not-so-straight bur Just-as- 
narrow Press. Hyper-radical. And in the center ring we 
have that incredible balancing act which we will call the 
Straight and Not-so-narrow Press.
Straight journalism is a lot like sausage-packing. It 
consists of taking the unappetizing entrails of life and ren­
dering them palatable. It isn’t easy to fit the blood and 
tears and dirt of our crazy world into barren prose. Dull 
wriging is a difficult and thankless job, but hundreds of 
big-city dailies manage a consistent output of it.
The problem is not censorship, although that is the 
usual scapegoat for those who resent the tasteless diet of­
fered by today’s newspapers. It is entrenched habit, not 
repressive editing, that has stomped the life out of the 
news.
Consider an illustration or two. Everybody is fam­
iliar with the innocuous little photographys that run in 
newspapers next to interviews or obits or crime reports. 
The pictures that make everybody liik like the “before’’ in 
a Geritol ad. Or how the most controversial and exciting 
issue appears dry and clean cut in the bland format and 
tapered newsprint of the press. But the moment a news­
paper gets away from that solemn black-and-grey format 
it is leaning dangerously toward creativity. What news 
paper wants to be accused of creativity? It sounds like 
art, which is ominously like life, which is a pretty touchy 
subject, possibly even controversial, God forbid.
The slogan of the Narrow Press (and, incidently, of 
the New York Times) is: “All the news that’s fit to print.” 
In the every day life of a reporter this is abbrievated in 
the sacred word, “newsworthy.” War, politics, taxes, crime, 
riot, famine, plague, pollution, and opinions of “respon­
sible spokesmen” are questionably newsworthy. Whether 
anybody cares about them or not. Charity and heroism are 
newsworthy if they are dramatic or cute. Youth is signi­
ficant if it becomes a Sociological Phenomenon. Some­
where a bit farther down the line of priorities is a classifi­
cation called “human interest,” in which the stories must 
conform to a certain plot. For example, you may read about 
a juvenile delinquent who reformed and put himself through 
Harvard selling bookends for Junior Achievement. You are 
less likely to read about the kid who dropped out of Har­
vard and successfully established an underground news­
paper. No “human interest” there.
The underground press, incidently, is a prime example 
of narrowness in journalism. I would venture to guess
that there myopia is due to a lack of historical perspec­
tive; my strongest evidence is the way underground jour­
nalists boast about how revolutionary it is to write 
news that doesn’t pretend to be objective. Journalism 
was born screaming its opinions in place of facts, and it 
was only maturity (or was it senility) that brought the 
pretense of objective reporting.
Underground writing usually ranges from kinder­
garten baroque to radical doctrinaire, a precarious balance 
of grammar and graffiti assembled in carefree collage 
and decorated with ads for boutiques and gay bars. While 
the underground press has a refreshing life to it, it is fre­
quently incapable of getting beyond drivvling polemic.
If you distill the slogan of the Narrow Press, you get 
the slogan of the Straight Press: “All the news we print 
fits.”
Sometimes, for example, news has to be tailored to fit 
Remember two years ago, when CMU was subtly used to 
illustrate the hazards of LSD use. A crisis; reporters counld 
not collect the proper information and settings for a suc­
cessful story, which they cleverly overcame by bringing 
along a set of freshly painted signs, pro-acid, and stamping 
out in the snow, catchy slogans defending drugs. Instant 
news.
News style is clean, sane, and grammatical in the ob- 
nixious sort of way that Durwood Kirby is clean, sane, 
and grammatical. There is no room in straight news for 
electric dialetic of Tom Wolfe or the jabberwocky of Lew­
is Carrol or anything else but codified gloom. The Re­
sult is that writers who have something new to say or an 
exciting way to say it are migrating away from news­
papers. Still, major straight newspapers are secure in their 
mediocrity that they can digest a large number of artistic 
young reporters and “reform” them into bland writers
How nice it would be to avoid the tedium of straight 
journalism and the myopia of narrow journalism. While the 
battle under the big top continues, I wonder if there is 
room for a side show?

Do you think a bright young engineer 
should spend 
his most imaginative years on 
the same assignment?
Neither do we.
That’s why we have a two- 
year Rotation Program for 
graduating engineers who 
would prefer to explore several 
technical areas. And that’s why 
many of our areas are organ­
ized by function —rather than 
by project.
At Hughes, you might 
work on spacecraft, communi­
cations satellites and/or tacti­
cal missiles during your first 
two years.
All you need is an EE, ME 
or Physics degree and talent.
If you qualify, we’ll arrange for 
you to work on several different 
assignments.. .and hTe can 
help pick them.
You may select special­
ized jobs, or broad systems- 
type jobs. Or you can choose 
not to change assignments if 
you’cf rather develop in-depth 
skills in one area.
Either way, we think 
you'll like the Hughes ap­
proach.
It means you’ll become 
more versatile in a shorter 
time. r------------------

Peaceful Rally 
Turns Violent 
For Professor
by JOHN AGATSTON
For most people at Point 
State Park on Wednesday there 
was a peaceful march and rally 
which ended about 7:00 p.m. This 
was not the case, however, for 
David Houston, an economics pro­
fessor at Pitt, and Ed Fuller, a 
member of the Resistance whohad 
spoken at CMU earlier in the 
day.
David Houston had stopped at 
the corner of Fifth and Wood at 
about 7 p.m. to get a bus back to 
Oakland. Here Houston sat down 
with a number of students who 
had been at the rally; Some mem­
bers of the TPF (Tactical Patrol 
Force) asked Houston and the stu­
dents to get up because they were 
blocking the sidewalk. Hous­
ton and one other student, Bur­
ton Aschiem, remained seated 
and Houston said, “Why, what’s 
the point?” At that point the 
policeman took Houston and As- 
cheim into the paddy wagon. Soon 
after a high school girl was thrown 
into the police wagon for some­
thing she had said. As the door 
was opened to put the girl in, 
Houston said to the people 
gathered outside, “This is what is 
meant by a police riot.” In reac­
tion to this remark an of­
ficer punched Houston in the 
nose. Houston was beaten again 
later when being taken to his 
jail cell. (For a more com­
plete report refer to the Oct. 16 
issue of the Pittsburgh Point.)
Ed Fuller was arrested about 
6:00. He had asked a TPF of­
ficer why he was standing in his 
position in line, keeping the count­
er-demonstrators separate from 
the marchers (going under the 
bridge leading to the park). In 
reaction to Ed’s remark he was 
dragged to the police wagon and 
later taken off to jail. Ed was 
charged with assault and battery, 
on an officer, disorderly conduct, 
and resisting arrest. Ed’s bond was 
set at $10,000 and he was forced 
to spend the night in jail before 
the bond was dropped to one 
dollar.

Probably the first serious Re­
publican contender for mayor 
in Pittsburgh in many years, 
Mr. Tabor has recently been 
accused of seeking the vote of 
middle America” by calling 
ior “law and order” and by 
seeming to link right-wing anti­
union sentiment with the goals 
of the Black Construction Coali­
tion.

5 Student Courts Responsible for Discipline.
Disciplinary Groups
Discipline at C-MU is current­
ly the responsibility of a group 
of student courts including 
Men’s Dormitory Court, AWS Ju­
dicial, CFP Court, Panhellenic 
Court, and the General Student 
Court. Each of these courts has 
original jurisdiction in the hear­
ing of cases which stem from 
violations of regulations developed 
either by the student government 
units to which the court reports 
or general campus regulations 
which students have expressed an 
interest in maintaining enforce­
ment of. Of these, CFP Court 
contains both faculty and student 
justices; all of the others are stu­
dent courts.
The General Student Court 
may serve as an appellate Court 
to hear appeals from any of the 
student courts listed above.
The Disciplinary Committee 
is appointed by the President of 
the University. Its chairman is the 
Dean of Student Affairs, and it 
includes three members of the ad­
ministration, Dean Steinberg, 
Dean Rice and Dean Mullins or 
one of his associate deans designa­
ted by him; three members of the 
faculty, which currently include 
professor Forstall of Mechanical 
Engineering and Professor Hayes 
of the English Department; and 
three members of the student 
body.
Appointments are made to the 
Committee upon the recommenda­
tion of the Chairman of the Com­
mittee in consultation with the 
Chairman of the Faculty Senate 
or the President of Student Gov­
ernment, as appropriate. The Dis­
ciplinary Committee hears cases 
as a court or original jurisdic­
tion when they involve viola­
tion of academic regulations, 
e.g., plagiarism, cheating etc., 
and if administratively — develop­
ed campus regulations designed 
to guarantee either the safety or 
the security of campus personnel 
or the rights of the University.
It is an appellate court, also, 
hearing appeals from decisions 
of the student courts.
Final University review for dis­
ciplinary cases and in effect fin­
al appeal from the actions of the 
Disciplinary Committee is assign­
ed by the President to Dr. Kib- 
bee, Vice President for Adminis­
tration and Planning. Ordinarily, 
Dr. Kibbee will review cases only 
if the appeal is based upon an 
error in carrying out due process 
before the Disciplinary Commit­
tee or a claim that the punish­
ment imposed is cruel or unusual.
The President of the University 
is legally responsible for disci­
pline; therefore, all disciplinary 
groups and committees are con­
stituted as responsible to him. Stu­
dent courts have an additional re­
sponsibility in that their opera­
tion procedures are sanctioned 
in the constitution of Student 
Government.
Due Process
The University attempts to 
guarantee due process in all dis­
ciplinary procedures. To provide 
for it, it requires in the case of 
the Disciplinary Committee, and 
attempts to require in the opera­
tion of student courts, that the fol­
lowing steps will always be taken:
1. A student appearing before 
a disciplinary group must be no­
tified in writing of the specific 
charge for which his case is 
to be reviewed. Such notifica­
tion in the case of students ap­
pearing before thsciplinary 
committee is normally made at 
least five days before the hear­
ing.
2. At the time the student is 
presented with the charge, the 
student is informed of his right 
to have another student, faculty 
member, or legal counsel ap­
pear with him at the time of the 
hearing. He is requested, how­
ever, to notify the hearing group 
in advance if he plans to have 
legal counsel present so that the 
hearing group may determine 
whether it wishes to obtain legal 
advice in connection with the 
hearing.
3. Students appearing before 
the Disciplinary Committee are 
informed of their right to request 
student members of the commit­
tee to absent themselves from 
hearing in the event that the na­
ture of the offense or the material 
necessary to obtain responsible 
judgment is of so private or con­
fidential a nature that the student 
would be embarrassed if the in­
formation became available to 
other members of the student 
body.
4. Prior to the hearing, the stu­
dent is also informed that the 
disciplinary groups on campus 
function in judgmental capacity, 
that their stated purpose is to de­
termine appropriate University 
response in the face of an alleg­
ed violation of University regula­
tions and that, as a result, the 
hearing process itself will be con­
ducted in investigatory fashion 
rather than as an adversary process 
designed to test evidence.
5. The actions of all disciplin­
ary groups on the campus are 
confidential. Records of disciplin­
ary actions may not be released 
at any time without the consent 
of the student. Disciplinary files 
are confidential and are destroy­
ed three years after a student 
has lef the campus either as the 
result of graduation or an action 
by the Disciplinary Committee.
Type and Frequency of cases.
The following is a review of 
the frequency of certain kinds of 
cases before the various disci­
plinary groups on campus:
1. AWS Judicial: 3-4 cases a 
week, chiefly involving viola­
tions of dormitory hours and par- 
iental regulations.
2. Men’s Dormitory Court: An 
average of one case a week over 
the academic year chiefly in­
volving violations of regulations 
governing dormitory conduct or the 
use of dormitory equipment, or 
pariental regulations.
3. CFP Court: 3-4 cases a year 
involving financial obligations 
of individual members of fra­
ternities.
4. Panhellenic Court: Seldom 
more than one case a year usual­
ly involving violations of rush 
regulations.
5. General Student Court: 
Seldom more than one case a year 
usually involving violations of 
rush regulations.
5. General Student Court: Sel­
dom more than one or two cases 
a year, usually cases involving 
students who are not subject to 
other student courts who have
violated general campus regula­
tions which the student body 
wishes to accept responsibility 
for enforcing.
6. Disciplinary Committee 
Averages two cases per month 
About 1/4 involve appeals from, 
student courts; and the remainder 
are normally cases involving stu­
dent conduct where personal or 
confidential behavioral problems 
are involved.

Submitted by Patrick Cavanagh
The following is a brief out­
line of a possible structure for 
Carnegie-Mellon University’s 
disciplinary system. It is only 
the structure, however; the con­
tent can be worked out and fil­
led in once the form is approved.
The entire system shall be 
called the University Code of 
Discipline and shall consist of 
three parts:
1. University Bill of Rights
2. The University Courts
3. University Sanctions.
The system is based on the follow­
ing principles:
A. The University shall be di­
vided into three constituencies:*
1. Administration.
2. Faculty
3. Student Body
B. Each constituency and each 
constituent shall have certain 
rights as a member of the Uni­
versity community. These rights 
shall be defined in the Univer­
sity Bill of Rights.
C. If any constituent, group 
of constituents, or constituency 
as a whole feels that his rights 
have been violated by any other 
constituent, group of constituents, 
or constituency as a whole, then 
he may petition the University 
court to rule on the violation.
D. The University Court must 
then hold a hearing and decide 
whether an infration has occured, 
and if so, decide what sanctions 
are to be applied.
E. Appeals may be to the Uni­
versity Court of Appeals.
F. All decisions of the Univer­
sity Courts shall be binding on 
each constituency and all con­
stituents.
*The Alumni and the Board of 
Trustees must be included as a 
fourth and fifth constituency if 
this is thought useful.
University Bill of Rights
The University Bill of Rights 
shall define the rights of each 
constituent and of each con­
stituency as a whole.
For any proposed document to 
be accepted as the University 
Bill of rights, it must be approved 
by a majority vote of each con­
stituency in a referendum held for 
that purpose.
For ahy amendment of the Uni­
versity Bill of Rights to become 
effective, it must be passed by a 
two-thirds vote in at least two 
constituencies held for the pur­
pose of amendment.
Some examples of possible rights 
of constituencies or of constitu­
ents are:
1. The right to maintain the 
normal operation of the Univer­
sity. (Administrative constituency)
2. The right to maintain the 
normal operation of the dormi­
tories (Administrative constitu­
ency)
3. The right to maintain the
normal operation of the Faculty 
Senate (Faculty constituency)
4. The right to hold classes
(Faculty constituency)
5. The right of academic free­
dom (Faculty constituency)
6. The right to maintain the
normal operation of Skibo (Stu­
dent constituency).
7. The right of freedom of
speech (Student constituent)
8. The right to attend classes 
(Student constituent)
The University Courts
A. Upon receipt of a petition,
the University Court shall hold 
a hearing to rule upon the 
case presented in the petition.
The plaintiff and defendent may 
represent themselves or have 
counsel.
B. The University Court shall 
decide whether an infraction has 
occured and, if so, what sanctions 
shall be applied.
C. Upon receipt of a petition 
appealing the decision of the Uni­
versity Court, the University 
Court of Appeals shall hold a 
hearing to decide whether the rul­
ing of the University Court 
shall be reversed. The Plaintiff 
and Defendent may represent 
themselves or have counsel.
D. The University Court 
shall have three justices — one 
elected from each constituency 
by a majority vote of its con­
stituents.
E. The University Court of 
Appeals shall have three jus­
tices — one from each consti­
tuency — appointed by the Presi­
dent of the University and sub­
ject to ratification by the Ad­
ministration, the Student Govern­
ment and the Faculty Senate.
F. In each court the jus­
tices shall elect a chief justice 
from among themselves to preside 
as chairman of the hearings.
G. Each justice’s term of of­
fice shall extend from the time 
of his election or appointment 
until he resigns, is impeached or 
is no longer a member of the 
constituency from which he was 
elected or appointed.
H. Impeachment of a justice is 
initiated upon the receipt by 
the President of the University of 
a petition signed by at least
50 members of university consti­
tuencies. The impeachment proce­
dure requires a 4/5 vote of at least 
two of the following: Administra­
tion ; the Student Government; the 
Faculty Senate.
University Sanctions
Possible sanctions that the Uni­
versity Court might apply to the 
constituents or constituencies 
are:
I. an order to rescind or
cease the action that incurred 
the infraction.
2. Admonition.
3. Fines.
4. Probation, suspension or ex-^ 
plusion from the constituency 
(and thus loss of privileges of a 
constituent such as, for a stu­
dent, participation in student 
activities, voting in student elec­
tions, or, for a faculty member, 
holding office in Faculty Sen­
ate, voting in Faculty elections, 
etc.)
5. Probation, suspension or ex- 
plusion from the University. ^
The University Court should fol­
low two principles in applying 
sanctions:
..A. Infractions that are directly 
punishable under civil or crim­
inal law should not receive san­
ctions as that would amount to 
double punishment.
B. Sanctions should not only 
match infractions in severity, f 
but should also, where possible, 
correspond to the type of infrac­
tion (e.g., a non-academic infrac­
tion should receive a non-aca­
demic sanction.
Spiro-Again?
Vice President Agnew con- f 
denmed the Vietnam Morator- * 
ium as an unwise demonstration 
“encouraged by an effete corps of 
impudent snobs who character­
ize themselves as intellectuals,” 
Monday.
He further warned that “hard­
core dissidents and professional 
anarchists were planning “wild­
er and more violent” anti-war 
demonstrations Nov. 15. While \ 
admitting that many partici­
pants in last Wednesday’s Mora­
torium were “Well motivated 
young people,” Mr. Agnew was 
very critical of the nation’s youth.
“The Young, at the zenith of 
physical power and sensitivity, 
overwhelm themselves with drugs 
and artificial stimulants.” Thus, 
he continued, “subtlety is lost and 
fine distinction based on acute rea- '4 
soning are carelessly ignored in 
a headlong jump to a predeter­
mined conclusion.”
Speaking about the Morator­
ium, Mr. Agnew said that peace 
demonstrators had failed to con­
sider that leaders of the protest 
“had billed it as a massive out­
pouring of sentiment against the 
foreign policy of the President , 
of the United States.”
“Most did not care to be re­
minded that the leaders of the 
moratorium refused to disasso­
ciate themselves from theobjec- 
tive enunciated by the enemy in 
Hanoi.” he said.
If the demonstrations had any 
use at all, he continued, “it ser­
ved as an emotional purgative for 
those who feel the need to cleanse 
themselves.

years but subject to recall and re­

DUE PROCESS
A. Assignment of Jurisdiction
The Plaintiff submits a de­
position (a signed statement of 
the facts of the case as he per­
ceives them) to the Independent 
Referee, who then calls upon the 
defendent to do likewise. Based 
on the nature of the case, the 
Independent Referee decides 
which hearing group shall have 
original jurisdiction. In cases 
of serious or intimate nature, or 
cheating, the jurisdiction lies 
with the Disciplinary Commit­
tee. In all other cases, jurisdic­
tion lies with the Student Court, 
except that the independently 
conceived regularions of social 
organizations on the campus 
which do not have the force of 
university regularions may be 
enforced through a judicial process 
determined by the social organ­
izations themselves (e.g., rush 
rules may be heard in a judgi- 
cial process determined by the 
social organization themselves). 
Appeals from such proceedings 
may be sent via the independent 
referee to the University judi­
cial system. The Independent 
Referee is responsible for guaran­
teeing that all parties to the case 
have copies of both depositions 
as well as a notification of the 
time and place of the hearing 
(members of the appropriate hear­
ing group, the plaintiff, and the 
defendant).
B. Hearing Group Procedures
The Independent Referee is 
responsible for guaranteeing that 
all cases will be heard within 
ten days after the defendant is 
notified of the accusation against 
him. In the event of delays in 
the hearing, the Independent 
Referee is responsible for notify­
ing all parties to the case of the 
cause for the delay.
Both the plaintiff and the de­
fendant must be aavailable 
for questioning at the hearing. 
On the basis of the information 
in the depositions, the hearing 
group may decide to question 
either the plaintiff of the defend­
ant. If there is questioning, the 
Chairman of the Disciplinary Com­
mittee of the Chief Justice of 
the Student Court shall act in the 
capacity of procedural referee; 
only members other than the 
Chairman or the Chief Justice 
may direct questions. The hear­
ing group is to adjudicate on the 
basis of the facts presented in 
the depositions and those uncover­
ed by questioning. A majority 
vote is necessary for a decision. 
The Chairman and the Chief Jus­
tice vote only in case of a tie. 
All decisions become final five 
school days after hearing unless 
an appeal is filed.
C. Appeals
All decisions of either hearing 
group may be appealed if the 
Independent Referee is notified 
of the defendant’s desire to ap­
peal within five days after the de­
cision. If the decision of the Stu­
dent Court is appealed, it is re­
viewed by the Disciplinary Com­
mittee only on the basis of harsh­
ness of punishment or procedural 
violations. (In the event that new 
evidence should arise that has im­
portant bearing on the decision, 
the independent referee will de­
cide to have the case reheard 
before the hearing group of or­
iginal jurisdiction). Before the 
review, the Disciplinary Com­
mittee of the Vice President for 
Administration and Planning 
must be presented both of the 
original depositions and the min­
utes of the original hearing. At 
the time of the review hearing.
the plaintiff, the defendant, and 
the Chief Justice of the original 
Court must be available for ques­
tioning. The Vice President for 
Administration and Planning is 
the final appeal in the judicial 
process of the University.
To rectify gross miscarriage 
of justice, either to the defen­
dant of the University, the appel­
late elements of the University’s 
judicial process have the right — 
exercisable under extraordinary 
circumstances — to review de 
novo the decision of the lower 
hearing group. This right will be 
exercised only at the recommenda­
tion of the President of the Uni­
versity. This review must focus 
on the penalties assigned to the 
defendent, not the rationale pro- 
voded.
D. Counsel
The defendant, the plaintiff, 
or the Court may request legal 
counsel to be present on his be­
half. In the event that any one of 
the parties to a hearing intends 
to have counsel present, the 
other parties must be notified 
twenty-four hours prior to the 
hearing. The defendant may have 
character witnesses appear on his 
behalf such as members of the 
faculty or student body at the hear­
ing. It should be noted, however, 
that due process is not an adver­
sary process.
E. Sanctions
Student Court can impose any 
reasonable penalty short of sus­
pension or explusion. Never­
theless, they can recommend to 
the Administration of the Uni­
versity that these more serious 
penalties be imposed for particul­
arly serious offenses. Probation, 
fines, and campusing are all 
within the power of the Stu­
dent Court.
The Disciplinary Committee 
can impose, reduce, or vacate 
all penalties including course 
failure, suspension, and explu­
sion. The Vice-President for Ad­
ministration and Planning can 
sustain, reduce, or vacate any 
penalty.
It is also within the right of 
any element of this judicial sys­
tem to have injunctive power.
F. Confidentiality of the Dis­
ciplinary Process.
Records of any judicial proceed­
ing are maintained in the Di­
vision of Student Affairs and are 
completely confidential and are 
not to be released to any indivi­
dual or organization except the 
student court, Disciplinary Com­
mittee, academic dean of the stu­
dent, department head of the 
student, the student, or his appoint­
ed counsel.
G. Disqualification
The Student Court and the 
Disciplinary Committee shall 
provide procedures for the dis­
qualification of any justice or 
member who has an interest in 
the case being heard.
Comp. Center
A University Computation 
Council has been instituted at C- 
MU to aid the short and long- 
range operations of the Computa­
tion Center. Chairman of the Coun­
cil is Richard M. Cyert, Dean of 
GSIA. A three man Computa­
tion Board was elected at the 
last University Computation Coun­
cil meeting on October 13j
The duties of the Board include 
review and approval of the fol­
lowing items: All investments in 
excess of $7500; changes in pric­
ing of allocation schemes; opera­
ting procedures and schedules 
for computation service; major 
changes in operating procedur­
es and schedules for computa­
tion service; major changes in 
operating systems or supported 
programming systems; appoint­
ment of Assistant Directors, other 
operating guides developed by 
the Center in response to the Pol­
icy Statement, and Conformance 
of operations with policy and di­
rectives.

Tartans Lose To Lewis & Gators, 70-39
On The Sports Scene----------------------------------The Tartans trailed 34-27 going into the final quarter at Allegheny on 
Saturday but the Gators errupted four touchdowns to win 70-39. Allegheny’s 
All-District quarterback Mike Ganey ran for 121 yards and passed for 322 in 
bringing his team’s record to 2-2. Jay Lewis was also a big problem to the 
Tartan defense, catching 10 passes for 254 yards and four touchdowns, three of 
them in the Gator’s last quarter surge.
By the middle of the opening per­
iod, Allegheny had scored twice on an in­
terception by Lewis and a 32 yard pass 
from Ganey to Hahn. Rich Squires scor­
ed on a 35 yard broken play run minutes 
later.
After Ganey ran for nine yards and 
another Allegheny score, CMU tied the 
game with six minutes left in the first 
half. On a fourth and goal situation from 
the one, Terry Bell dove over a pile of de­
fenders and John Hastings added the ex­
tra point. The tying touchdown was set
up on a pass from Squires to Chuck
Price.
Before the half ended Allegheny
had scored twice more to make it 34-20.
The Tartans were close for the last 
time in the early part of the fourth quar­
ter on a 46 yard scoring toss to Price. 
Earlier, the two teams traded touchdowns 
when Squires’ 22 yard pass to Tony
Bugel was countered by Ganey’s 7 yard 
score.
After that, Lewis scored on three pass 
plays to put the game out of reach.
TARTAN TIDBITS:
Lewis, playing on offense and defense, 
picked off three passes while covering 
Price man-to-man throughout most of the 
game .... Curtis Simmons played a good 
game for the Tartans in the defensive 
backfield. He caught Ganey from be­
hind to save one touchdown and came 
out of nowhere to intercept a pass in the 
third quarter . . . Price put a good move 
on an Allegheny defender as he ran 46 
yards untouched for Tech’s fifth touch­
down. . . . The two teams combined for 
908 yards in total offense. The Tartan de­
fense forced the Gators into nine punt­
ing situations while CMU punted only 
seven times .... Squires was 17 for 48 
but tried mostly long passes in the second 
half.
The defensive line put in another good 
rush on Ganey most of the time but the 
Gator quarterback was trapped for only 
one big loss .... Bugel was back in the 
lineup for the first time since the open­
ing game.
The cheerleaders put in another good 
performance and would like to thank those 
20 or 25 hearty fans who went all the way 
to Meadville and actually cheered.
This was the Tartan’s third homecom­
ing game this year. Next week CMU plays 
a homecoming game at home for a change 
when they battle Franklin & Marshall at 
the Tech Bowl at 1:30. Last year the 
Tartans took a 7-6 decision at Lancaster. 
F & M finished the year 6-2 and has most 
regulars returning this year.

After seven years of incompetant play and cellar finishes, the New York Mets 
amazed the world by defeating the invincible Baltimore Orioles in the World 
Series last week. Their feat represented the victory of the underdogs. They knocked 
the establishment off of the pedestal. They overcame 100-1 odds and defied logic. 
They are in with the times.
The Mets’ formula for success was simple. It was a combination of teamwork, 
sacrifice (the platoon system made a contributor out of every one but a regular play­
er out of few.), and divine help. The Orioles Brooks Robinson had said. “Were 
out to prove there’s no Santa Claus.” After seeing Tommie Agee's two super cat 
ches save one Met win, Ron Swoboda’s diving grab save another, A1 Weis trade in 
his .215 season batting average for a .455 series and Don Clendenon (a Pirate rejectv\ 
slam three big homeruns, maybe Brooks has changed his mind.
When asked if God was a Met fan. Met pitching ace Tom Seaver replied, “No. 
but he has an apartment in New York City.”
As the summer progressed, the diverse population of New York City found a com­
mon cause in the Mets. Black and white, rich and poor found themselves sharing 
the excitement of the Amazing Mets with banners in hand, transistor radio against 
ear and faith in miracles. There was no hot summer in New York this year.
Even Wednesday's Moratorium became tied in with the concurrent Met con 
quest. During the peace march through Central Park, a banner stood out which read; 
“If the Mets can do it, so can we!” Color the Orioles red for the red faced estab­
lishment who once believed their position to be one of power and security — “We 
don’t think there's anyone that can beat us,” boasted Frank Robinson, the Baltimore 
slugger.
Call the Mets lucky if you want to. Or say that the series was a fluke. But the 
Mets are the champs now. They caused their severest critics to take notice of them by 
beating them at their own game. And they taught us a valuable lesson too.

ite score 32-23 in a duel meet. The Tar­
tans now post a 3-3-1 record.

PiKA Wins Football Crown
PKA won the IM touch football 
crown by defeating BTP on Satur­
day, 24-23. Barry Benjamin, 
the PKA quarterback, tossed a 
pair of scoring passes in the first 
half. Beta quarterback Hans Car­
ter directed his team to two 
scores in first hals also but PKA 
led 16-14.
Each team scored once more in 
the second half, however, BTP 
picked up more first downs and 
held a 23-22 lead going into the
final minute of play. Faced with a 
fourth down and 15 yards to go 
for the first dow. Benjamin’s pass 
fell incomplete. But a defensive 
holding penalty gave PKA first 
down to tie the score at 23. 
Then PKA got the go ahead point 
on a 15 yard pass play and pro­
ceeded to run out the clock for the 
win.
