Carnegie Tech Outplays West­
minster on Muddy Field.
If the Carnegie Tech football team 
had been weighed immediately after 
last Saturday’s game with Westmin­
ster, the average weight would have 
been found to be at least ten pounds 
greater. So bemired were they that, 
it is said, the coaches waited until 
after scrapers, soap and water had 
been applied for ten whole minutes 
before congratulating them separately 
and collectively upon the magnificent 
game that the men put up. This was 
not only prudent, but necessary.
The game was remarkable in nu­
merous ways. Many ascribe our vic­
tory,—and justly, perhaps,-—to the 
presence of a large body of our dis­
tantly loved Margaret Morrison Car­
negie School girls, and to their songs, 
rendered lustily and loyally. Under 
the direction of Miss Stoner, the girls 
never failed to break into song when 
the team needed encouragement or 
applause. Forgetting themselves in a 
dampness that would remove a natural 
curl, they displayed that unselfish de­
votion famed as “Carnegie Spirit,” 
and hitherto ascribed as a virtue of 
the three other schools.
Two-thirty o’clock was accompan­
ied by the dreariest of showers, and 
until three no sign of abatement was 
to be seen. Then, in the west the 
clouds began to thin, and soon the 
down-pour had slackened in a hope- 
giving degree. The crowd, waiting 
under every possible shelter, began to 
fill the stands, and were soon reward­
ed by the entrance of the players, 
just as the last drop fell,
The game was played with Tech 
Field in the worst condition of the 
year. In spite of the abundance of 
mud and the slippery ball, the game 
was fast. All of the local men played 
for all they were worth, and each in 
turn starred time after time. Balsing­
er, however, was the most brilliant 
performer, although Schmucker ran 
him a close second. The former car­
ried the ball for 63 yards through a 
broken field for a touchdown in the 
second quarter. He was helped on 
this occasion by the interference of 
his team-mates, notably Schmucker, 
who took off Ashton just as the West­
minster fullback was about to make 
a sure tackle. Atch played in the 
back field and made good in more 
ways than one. Lucas ran the team 
at top speed and played football right 
through the game.
Taylor and Clair were easily the 
stars of the middle line, and Craw­
ford played a rattling good game. Kes- 
selman showed his usual amount of 
speed until forced to retire after be­
ing hurt. McCully, who played the 
other end throughout the game, feat­

ured in a number of good plays and 
followed the ball closely. While the 
fumbles were numerous, owing to the 
slippery condition of the pig-skin, the 
Carnegie players were quick to recov­
er, and seldom lost materially. At 
times punting was the most prominent 
feature, and Schmucker always had 
the best of it over Ashton. He suc­
ceeded especially in getting off on- 
side kicks that the ends could recover 
in spite of the heavy field. We will 
admit that luck broke all our way, 
but it would have helped us but little 
if the men had not followed the ball 
so closely that Dame Fortune just 
couldn’t get away.
The cheering was the best of the 
season, which is saying something 
great. A noteworthy omission was 
that of the usual snake-dance. No 
one was willing to lose a shine and 
gain a few pounds of mud. Besides, 
the Archies were in mourning for 
their mascot.
Acting-Captain Hayden won the 
toss-up and chose the western goal. 
Schmucker kicked off at 3:25 to Beach 
on the 20-yard line, and the ball was 
returned 5 yards, which was lost as 
a penalty for off-side play on the next 
scrimmage. Ashton kicked to Bal­
singer who fumbled. McQuiston re­
covered the ball on his own 46-yard 
line. Beach gained 3 yards through 
the line, then Ashton punted to Car­
negie 15 mark, returning the ball 3 
yards. Schmucker kicked to Turnbull 
on our 50 line, Ayers getting the man 
for no gain. Scaffold negotiated 11 
yards through the line, and Hayden 
added 3 more. Westminster was pen­
alized 15 yards for holding. Ashton 
started a forward pass that Hayden 
received successfully, and gained 35 
yards before Balsinger got him on our
4-yard line. Ashton went through the 
line for the first touchdown after 6 
minutes of play. Beach kicked goal.
Schmucker kicked off to Beach on 
his 15 line, and the little quarterback 
returned 25 yards. Ashton’s kick was 
blocked by Taylor, and Clair fell on 
the ball on Westminster’s 30 mark. 
Balsinger gained 8 yards, and 
Schmucker 2. Westminster was pen­
alized 5 yards for off-side, and after 
Schmucker had gained 2 units, the 
visitors drew the same penalty again. 
With the ball on Westminster’s 9-yard 
mark, Balsinger gained 5 yards on two 
line bucks, then Atch went around 
right end for a touchdown. Schmuck­
er kicked goal from placement, while 
the game was still not ten minutes 
old.
Tallant kicked off to our 30 line, 
where Taylor fell on the ball after 
several had fumbled it. Schmucker

So much has already been written 
about the Austin dam that it is doubt­
ful if I can add largely to the data 
known, but as I recently made a trip 
to it for the purpose of inspection 
have been asked to write a short arti­
cle for the readers of the Tartan.
The dam at Austin, Pa., was built 
in 1909 to impound water for the Bay- 
less Pulp and Paper Co. It was 
straight in plan, 544 feet long,... 
feet wide at the top, and 30 feet at 
the bottom. The section was approx­
imately a trapezoid, with the upstream 
face vertical. The concrete was com­
posed of 1 part cement, 3 parts of 
crushed stone, and six parts of broken 
stone, some large rocks were also 
embedded in the structure.
It rested on a thin layer of parti­
ally disintegrated shale, 8 inches to 3 
feet thick, underlaid by clay. A key,
THE BODY OF THE LATE LA­
MENTED “FIRM” SOLEMNLY 
LAID AT REST.
Promptly at 3:30 o’clock Monday 
afternoon in the temporary chapel of 
the School of Applied Design, the last 
sad rites were performed over the re­
mains of the far-famed and truly emi­
nent parrot mascot of that school. The 
death occurred Saturday morning, 
from parrotonitis, it is claimed, and 
took from our unsuspecting midst, 
one whose budding career was fos-

4 feet wide, is said to have extended 
to solid rock, but I found no evidence 
of it.
On the 23rd of January, 1910, six 
weeks after completion, the reservoir 
was filled. At the same point where 
the main break occurred later on, a 
portion slid forward 18 inches, and 
tipped downstream 13 inches. The 
water was drawn off, and Mr. Hatton, 
constructing engineer, condemned the 
dam, and prophesied disaster if it 
were used again without strengthen­
ing.
Nevertheless, it was refilled last 
September. When the water reached 
the crest the dam gave way as it had 
before until it parted, allowing water 
to sweep down the valley. This is 
level transversely for about 500 feet 
with hills rising abruptly on either 
side. A mile and a half below the 
dam and in this valley lay the main

tered by every true architect, and 
whose ability to talk, however far in 
the hazy future, was anticipated by 
all.
After two days of a most splendid 
lying in state, he is now lying in real 
estate, beneath a marking monument 
of luxurious black marble.
The funeral was one of solemn and 
awe-inspiring grandeur, and was at­
tended by the highest dignitaries of 
the school. The flickering light of 
candles shed a pale, soft radiance upon 
the assembled throng. Preceptor Mc- 
Cullogh opened the ceremony with a 
short, yet eloquently delivered eulogy 
upon the deceased, which was fol­
lowed by the reading of a memorial 
ode by the Rt. Irreverent Mr. Chal- 
font.
A funeral dirge of unsurpassed ex­
cellence composed for the occasion, 
was fittingly rendered by the gathered 
multitude. Then, thru the dimmed 
corridors the crepe shrouded mourners 
followed the draped funeral carriage 
to the yawning grave, where, after 
short addresses and plaintive lament, 
the last earthly fragments were low­
ered into the cavernous depths.-----------o-----------
SECOND TEAM’S SCHEDULE.
The Carnegie Tech second football 
team has but two games remaining 
on their schedule. On this coming 
Saturday, they will play the High 
School team at Coraopolis, and on 
Thanksgiving will meet the Sewick- 
ley Y. M. C. A. at Sewickley. The 
latter team is famed for its treatment 
of its guests, and have planned a big 
spread for the players after the game. 
Only those reporting for practice until 
the end of the season will be taken 
on these trips. All others will miss 
the big time planned for Thanksgiv­
ing night.

CALENDAR.
On Saturday we play, for the sec­
ond time in our football history, West­
ern Reserve University. This time the 
game will be played on their grounds 
in Cleveland instead of our own, but 
we nevertheless expect the game to 
end in the same way as the first, an­
other Tech victory. In order to attain 
this desirable end it is highly neces­
sary that the team be seconded in its 
efforts by a large and loyal band of 
rooters, the more the merrier. Rea­
sonable rates have been obtained and, 
provided 100 men go, a special train 
will be run. It is up to every Tech 
rooter who possibly can to take this 
trip. Let us take for our slogan, “On 
to Cleveland and Western Reserve.”
The Tartan desires to congratulate 
the M. M. C. S. student-body upon 
the spirit displayed at the Westmin­
ster game. Despite the unfavorable 
weather conditions the turnout was 
highly creditable, and much credit is 
due them for their singing and cheer­
ing. It is to be regretted that this 
feature was not thought of earlier in 
the season, and to be hoped that it 
will be retained in the remaining 
games and in seasons to come.
Since the starting of the Golf Tour­
nament many of the Faculty have 
spoken to the Editor of the benefit 
derived and have expressed a hope 
that the good work would not stop 
with the closing of the tournament. 
It has also been suggested that other 
tournaments can be gotten up to run 
through the winter, such as a bowling 
tournament, a bridge tournament, or a 
pool tournament. A number of dif­
ferent forms of entertainment are 
readily thought of. The spirit and 
desire are not wanting if a committee 
could be formed to make definite ar­
rangements.

part of the town of Austin. The dam 
broke at 2:20 and it took the waters 
just eleven minutes to reach the busi­
ness center of the town because I no­
ticed a clock there which had stopped 
at just 2:31.
The half mile just below the dam 
was filled many feet deep with short 
logs and slabs of pulp wood, mill sup­
plies of Bayless Co. This formed a 
-movable dam in front of the sweeping 
waters and ground into bits every­
thing in its path. It was a gruesome 
sight to find parts of pianos, couches, 
and other nice pieces of furniture 
mixed in hopeless confusion with 
wreckage of building material and, 
above all, the ever present pulp wood.
Had it not been for the energy dis­
played by the people in a house near 
the dam, and the heroism of a tele­
phone girl at Austin, or had the acci­
dent occurred at night, the loss of life 
would have been appalling. As it was, 
about a hundred were crushed to 
death; none were drowned.
The cross section of the dam agreed 
well with conservative practice. The 
•concrete has been severely criticized, 
'especially the bonding. However, but 
a small proportion of the cracks oc­
curred along the bonding lines, which 
shows that they were not much weak­
er than the mass itself.
A richer concrete would have been 
better, and more time should have 
elapsed after its completion before 
filling the reservoir. The writer found 
•only one batch of poor work, contain­
ing about a cubic yard, and but one 
¦case of “honey-combing.” The fact 
that the concrete was fairly good was 
proven by the large masses which re­
mained after rupture.
The main source of failure lay in 
the foundation. In one place near the 
principal break, the author probed two 
feet under dam and down two feet 
without finding any rock. Nor was 
it attached to the section of the dam 
which had moved. Either it was 
washed away or had never existed. 
The tipping forward of the dam when 
full, and backward when empty, shows 
the same thing. The failure was un­
doubtedly hastened by water flowing 
underneath the dam as testified to by 
witnesses.
The thin layer of shale on which 
the dam rested was weak of itself and 
derived little support from the wet 
-clay underneath; hence it either 
crumbled, broke, or tilted until the 
dam slid, causing the dreadful disaster 
with which we are now familiar.

CARNEGIE SONGS.
Owing to the popularity of last 
year’s song books the Musical Clubs 
have secured an additional 1,500 copies 
For the benefit of new men it might 
be well to say that this is the only 
source from which one can get all 
the Carnegie songs. It is up to every 
man, therefore, to secure one of these 
booklets and learn its contents unless 
he disclaims school spirit. Inasmuch 
as these books may be secured at the 
store room for five cents it ought not 
to tax any one financially to become 
an owner.
Alvin—“Tillies’ Nightmare,” a mu­
sical farce that has been seen at this 
house several times before, will re­

the real humor of Williams, the negro 
commedian, to recommend it.

MHO CLUB.
The November meeting of the Mho 
Club was held Wednesday evening, 
November 8th, in Room 121. After a 
short business meeting, the program 
of the evening was introduced. Owing 
to the unavoidable absence of the 
speaker of the evening, W. G. 
Schmucker, the original program was 
changed.
Altho having very little time for 
preparation, R. W. Freeland and R. J. 
Bryan, handled their subjects in a 
very creditable manner. The former, 
speaking of “The Relation of the En­
gineer to the Public,” advanced the 
idea that the engineer is very well 
equipped to aid in the improvement 
of the relations existing between the 
employe of the large corporation and 
his employers.
The other speaker chose for his 
subject, “The Development of the 
Modern Power Station.” This subject, 
although a trifle too far advanced for 
some of the members, was handled 
very well by Mr. Bryan. His dis­
cussion was very interesting and very 
instructive to all. It was gratifying 
to note the interest taken in the gen­
eral discussion. The usual “after pro­
gram” was carried out in the Club 
Room.

punted 35 yards to Beach, who re­
turned 3 yards, being stopped by 
Crawford. An exchange of punts 
followed when Lucas returned the ball 
to our 40 mark. An onside kick was 
recovered by Kesselman on Westmin­
ster’s 43 line. Schmucker failed to 
gain, but Balsinger made an inch short 
of 10 yards. On third down, Atch 
gained the inch, following it up with 
two short gains to the United Pres­
byterians’ 30-yard line. Clair’s at­
tempt at a field goal from placement 
went low and Beach, catching the ball 
just inside the goal line, returned 10 
yards. Ashton and Schmucker ex­
changed punts, then the former 
kicked to Lucas in the center of the 
gridiron. The Greensburg boy fol­
lowed his interference, which formed 
just as it should, and gained 30 yards. 
Balsinger and Lucas each gained 3 
yards before the quarter ended.
The second period opened with 
third down for Carnegie on West­
minster’s 21 line. The Plaid boys 
failed on a forward pass, and lost the 
ball, also being penalized on the next 
offside play. Scafford could not gain, 
and Ashton punted to Carnegie’s 53 
line. Westminster was penalized for 
offside. Schmucker’s kick was blocked 
and the ball recovered by Manson, 30 
yards from goal. Hayden gained 5 
yards, and Beach 2, but their team 
was penalized 20 yards for advancing 
the ball after it was down. A forward 
pass failed, and Ashton punted to Bal­
singer out of bounds on our 10 mark. 
Schmucker kicked to Beach, who 
fumbled, and Taylor recovered the 
ball on our 50 mark. Schmucker again 
punted to Beach 32 yards from his 
goal. A poor pass to Ashton lost 6 
yards for the visitors, and Ashton 
kicked to Balsinger on our 47 mark. 
Balsinger, starting with a leap, dodged 
his opponents, and with the aid of 
superb interference, galloped at top 
speed to the goal posts, where he 
placed the ball after a 63-yard run. 
Schmucker missed an attempt at goal, 
and the score was 11 to 6.
Ashton kicked off to Lucas, who re­
turned 5 yards to the 20 mark. Mc- 
Cully recovered an onside kick in the 
middle of the field. Balsinger made 
a 17-yard gain, and Atch was good 
for 10 more. Balsinger failed to gain 
because of a foozled pass. Clair at­
tempted another field goal from place­
ment but missed. Ashton kicked, and 
the half ended with the ball in the 
middle of the field. Score—Carnegie, 
11; Westminster, 6.
Schmucker kicked off to McQuiston, 
who brought the ball back 10 yards 
to the 25 mark. Ashton punted to 
Lucas, who returned 20 yards to 40 
from the visitors’ goal. A series of 
fumbles followed, and Schmucker re­
covered the last on his own 50 mark. 
A penalty of 10 yards was handed 
to the other side for holding. 
Schmucker gained 6 yards, and Capt. 
Taylor refused penalty for offside, 
taking first down. Balsinger gained 
5 yards, then Schmucker kicked to the 
10 mark. Ashton punted 23 yards.
Balsinger gained 2 yards, but Atch 
was thrown for a loss of 3. Schmucker 
again punted to the 10-yard mark. 
Patterson was substituted for Kessel­
man, who had been in distress for 
several downs. Clair blocked Ash­
ton’s punt, and then tackled the West­
minster man for a safety.

HERMAN H. ADAM
-DEALER IN-
New Manager Elected.
Considerable interest has been 
aroused by the action of the Board 
of Control in recognizing Tennis as 
a school activity and awarding letters 
for the members of the team. This 
action has long been desired by those 
who have played the game.
In the election of Walter G. Flood 
as manager of the 1911-12 team, a 
good man ha sbeen selected, one who 
understands the game in all its de­
tails. Flood has been prominent in 
all the tournaments played in this 
vicinity for the past three or four 
years, winning quite a number of 
prizes as results of his ability. He 
has been a member of the Carnegie 
team for the past two years.
To ex-Manager Manker, the tennis 
adherents owe a great deal for his 
patient efforts in bringing tennis be­
fore the Board of Control in a favor­
able light.
Director Hamerschlag returned
