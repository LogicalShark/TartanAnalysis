Activities Keys Subject 
Of Council Wrangling
by Dave Hubbard
High point of Student Council’s meeting last Wednesday was the 
fervid debate over a by-laws amendment. During the meeting on 
September 24, Dick Christensen moved that an amendment be passed 
striking a clause from Student Council’s by-laws.
This clause has made it impos-^-------------------------------------------
Gala Plans Set 
For Fall Carnival
Homecoming Features Coronation,
Carnegie Day, Game9 And Dance
Plans for Homecoming, the first all-school weekend of the year, 
indicate that it will be packed with interesting activity for the entire 
student body. Beginning with the annual Carnegie day exercises at 
11:30 a.m. in the main gym the celebration will be a real tribute
* to alumni returning to their Alma 
Mater. The highlight of the Car­
negie day program will be crown -
sible for freshmen and sophomores 
to receive activities keys even 
though they have accumulated 
the number of points necessary for 
these awards. It states that only 
upperclassmen are eligible for 
key awards. After some discussion 
the amendment was tabled.
When it was brought up at this 
week’s meeting, Christensen 
moved to remove the amendment 
from the table. A series of state­
ments by other members resolved 
him to back his amendment. After 
a debate in which most Student 
Council members took part, the 
amendment was put to a vote. The 
balloting was equally divided for 
and against the amendment, but 
since it takes a two-thirds ma­
jority of Council members to pass 
any law the amendment was de- 
feeated.
Committee Reports
Bill Stewart, head of the plans 
and programs committee, report­
ed that all pep rallies are tenta­
tively scheduled for the even­
ings of October 10, 24, and 31. 
He stated that it would be futile 
to have afternoon rallies because 
many important aspects of the 
rally would have to be eliminated. 
Phases such as the bonfire, the 
torch march, and the Kiltie band 
would be among those omitted 
from the rally.
Chairman of the permanent dec­
orations committee Larry Glavin
Thistle
There will be a meeting of 
the advertising staff of the 
Thistle on Tuesday, October 7, 
at 4:30 at the Thistle Office in 
Carnegie Union.
announced that this year’s campus 
chest drive is scheduled for No­
vember 4, 5, and 6. Canvassing 
for the drive will be done in the 
dorms and classrooms.
Reputed Profits
In the previous week’s Don 
Hand had questioned the Tartan’s 
reputed profits. To clear up this 
point publication’s committee 
chairman Dick Durstine pointed 
out that no activity on campus had 
been consistently in the black for 
over three years and that the 
seemingly exceptional Tartan 
profits would average out over a 
short period of time.
Debate Club Plans 
For Tournaments 
This Coming Year
After a successful season last 
year, Carnegie Tech’s debating 
club is making plans for an even 
better year. The national collegi­
ate topic to be used at most of 
the major tournaments throughout 
the country, is Resolved: That the 
Congress of the United States shall 
enact compulsory fair employ­
ment practice legislature.
The debaters expect to attend 
many of the same tournaments this 
year to which they sent teams last 
year as well as being hosts at their 
annual Carnegie Tartan Debate 
Tournament. The first tournament 
of the year is at the University 
of Pittsburgh for novice debaters 
to be held October 22. A few 
changes have been made. Small 
classes in speaking and debating 
are being held for anyone interest­
ed in forensic. Students who wish 
to attend these are requested to 
see Mr. Richard Oswant of the 
English department.
Address Change
Any student wishing to have 
his change of address includ­
ed in the new 1952-53 book 
student directory must report 
this change of address in 
writing to the department of 
public relations AH 127 be­
fore October 10.
A charge of 25 cents will be 
made to cover the cost of re­
setting type if a change of ad­
dress is brought to the depart­
ment of public relations be­
tween October 10 and 15. No 
change of address will be ac­
cepted for the 1952-53 student 
directory after October 15.
Scot Begins 
Talent Search
Opportunities for permanent 
placement on the Scot production

Get The Facts 
On Draft Test
Applications for the December
4, 1952 and the April 23, 1953 ad­
ministrations of the college quali­
fication test are now available at 
selective service system boards 
throughout the country.
Eligible students who intend to 
take this test on either date should 
apply at once to the nearest selec­
tive service board for an applica­
tion and a bulletin of informa­
tion.
Following instructions in the 
bulletin, the student should fill out 
his application and mail it immedi­
ately in the envelope provided. 
Applications for the December 4 
test must be postmarked no later 
than midnight, November 1, 1952.
According to educational testing 
service, which prepares and ad­
ministers the college qualification 
test for the selective service sys­
tem, it will be greatly to the stu­
dent’s advantage to file his applica­
tion at once, regardless of the test­
ing date he selects. The results 
will be reported to the student’s 
selective service local board for 
use in considering his deferment 
as a student.

CIT Student Discovers Chapel 
Program Well Attended
by John J, John. Jr., as told to R. Durstine
It is foolish of me to admit weakness publicly in this manner; 
but it is said that confession is good for the soul. Therefore I should 
like to frankly state that on one Tuesday last week (month and date 
will be supplied on request) I weakened to the extent that I tired 
for an hour of my pursuit of sci-*
entific knowledge and foerook j currently stand guard over the 
briefly the life of the engineer.
With simple (and perhaps even 
harmonic) humility, I now beg 
forgiveness from my fellow stu­
dents, not only for doing the deed 
I did that Tuesday, but also for 
letting an outside audience get 
wind of it through publication of 
these experiences in a public jour­
nal. Please have compassion at my 
first offense.
Flagon of Mead
I was sitting in my dingy cell 
in the metaphysics department on 
the day mentioned, toying with 
methods and formulae for the 
tra.ismutation of elements and the 
secret of everlasting j^outh, when 
I suddenly wearied of my labors.
I was bored with problems and 
proofs and was myself virtually 
reduced to an absurdity.
“Perhaps,” a small and usually 
scientifically objective voice with­
in me said, “you need nourish­
ment. A chunk of black bread and 
a slab of cheese in Skibo, washed 
down with a foaming flagon of 
mead, will turn the trick.” Taking 
the voice’s advice, I left the build­
ing and hurried toward the cafe­
teria, using, I might add, the walk 
nearest Administration Hall in or­
der to prevent possible reprisal 
from the freshman terrorists who
Senior Walk.
Public Hanging 
But on the way I got wind of 
something unusual. Chapel, I be- 
liveve it is called. It happens, they 
say, every week, but has seldom 
interested me in the past, not hav­
ing to do with the laws of the ma­
terial universe.
On this particular day, however, 
a huge crowd seemed headed for 
the gym to attend the chapel per­
iod. I had formerly believed that 
only a public hanging could bring 
out such a mob on this hallowed 
campus. I decided to follow them 
at a safe distance and see what 
stirred this interest.
Several Engineers 
On entering the gymnasium, I 
found it filled with assorted stu­
dents, faculty, and people. Most 
of them looked a little uneasy, like 
they had just swallowed their 
chews and hoped no one would no­
tice. A few, I learned, were fresh­
men who thought they had a phys­
ical education class that period. 
The majority, though, seemed in­
tent on attending the chapel.
I don’t want to turn informer, 
but I spotted several engineering 
students in the gathering.
Astounding Logic 
After we had all been uncom­
fortably seated on the boards lin­
ing the sides of the hall, the pro­
gram began, starting with an in­
troduction of the principals in­
volved. Then one of them sang 
(our gym acoustics helped some). 
But neither of these things seemed 
to be the main attraction of the 
meeting.
Finally, a tall, well fed looking 
gentleman in a bluish green suit 
(the first I have seen outside the 
physics department) rose and be­
gan to speak, building a web of 
facts with astounding logic to their 
irrevocable conclusion. We heard 
of his chats with congressmen, 
generals, and college officials. All 
these important folk share his 
opinions.
World is Doomed
He spoke of speaking to other 
groups like ours. They were, it 
seems, profoundly affected by 
what he had to say. He presented 
evidence, told us how long it 
would take to reach the Pyrenees 
(from Russia, during a war. that 
is), and that Britain is on the 
brinjc of Marxism.
At the end of 15 minutes, we 
were convinced that the world is 
in bad condition, that affairs are 
truly in sad shape. Some of the 
non-scientific students seem to 
have gotten wind of this before. 
In fact I had even suspected it 
myself. But now we were all con­
vinced, sure that the world is 
doomed.
Brief Pause
And then a remarkable thing 
happened. He changed the subject. 
There was a weak attempt to con­
nect the second part of his talk to 
the first, but the logical structure 
that had existed until then was 
broken. He left politics to dwell 
on philosophy, and to ask what he 
called unanswerable questions.
There will be c brief pause 
while the 1A faculty leaves.
It is true, he said (and I have no 
reason to doubt him), that it is the 
custom in Communistic countries 
to gather a group of citizens to­
gether, to preach to them and 
work them into an hysterical 
frenzy, to whip them up to such 
an emotional state that they rush 
forward to declare themselves 
Communists and become willing

TRAFFIC JAM ... It is always 
necessary to leave with one’s date 
fifteen minutes early to squeeze 
through the “traffic jam” at More- 
wood Gardens on Friday and Sat­
urday nights. My escort ran inter­
ference for me so I could sign in 
one-half minute early. Safe again!
NO PRAYERS . . . There will be 
no more prayers for rain at More- 
w o o d Gardens. Translation — 
pledges are not to kneel under the 
windows of the dorm to say pray­
ers for rain—which had formerly 
been answered by enthusiastic 
rain clouds.
DATE . . . One day we found a 
date on the concrete bench by the 
Fine Arts Building—that is, num­
bers—1927.
PONY TAILS . . . Have you no­
ticed the way in which the Frosh 
girls with pony tails struggle to 
get their dinks upon their heads? 
Most of them double the back un­
der and glue them down.
SERENADE . . . Sigma Chi Fra­
ternity of Pitt serenaded the girls’ 
dorm last Thursday. Naturally, 
there was a large audience of girls 
hanging out the windows. By the 
way, their singing was very good 
—even if they were from Pitt.
TORCHES . . .' Burning torches 
led the eager football fans to the 
bowl where a large gathering had 
accumulated for the Pep Rally! 
Enthusiastic voices yelled school 
cheers and sang the songs accom­
panied by the Kiltie Band. Then, 
since there wasn’t anything plan­
ned, the fans went their separate 
ways to create some form of 
amusement for themselves.
ANOTHER SERENADE . . . 
Beta Theta Pi serenaders at the 
girls’ dorm September 15 sent 
songs upward while tomatoes 
traveled downward in response to 
the soothing melodies.
TRANSFERS . . . Responding to 
the sign announcing a party for 
transfer students, two male grad­
uates hastened to the Union to 
spend an afternoon frolicking. 
Surprise! It was a female affair! 
Undaunted the lost sheep were 
taken into the fold and adopted 
regardless of sex. All had a good 
time.
LONG RANGE . . . Anybody 
want to contact Saxonburg? There 
really is a reason for that contrap­
tion atop Whitfield Hall. It is nec­
essary to keep the physics depart­
ment in touch with Saxonburg 
where the cyclotron laboratory is 
located. Therefore, the two are 
connected by a two-way radio— 
hence the sky-scraping aerial.
SIA . . . Maggie Murph, we’re 
back again! Several secretarial 
students with the intent to use the 
lounge at IA Building made the 
trip in vain. “That’s our place!” 
say the fellows.
Symphony Announces 
Special Student Prices
A plan to hear world-renowned artists who will be appearing 
this season with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra was today an­
nounced by Dr. Charles Pearson, of the department of music.
Sale of the tickets at exceptionally low prices will begin next 
Wednesday morning (October 15) +___________________________________.
at the Cashier’s office. Dr. Pear­
son called all campus music lov 
ers to notice the special event. 
This sale of season tickets, at 
prices of $9.00 for Friday nights 
and $7.00 for Sunday afternoon 
performances, will take the place 
of the Saturday morning sale.
Listing Kapell, Peters and Ru- 
benstein among the outstanding 
artists to appear here this season, 
he emphasized the value of the 
low concert rates enabling students 
to enjoy a never-to-be forgotten 
musical experience.
Opening October 31 and continu­
ing until November 2 at Syria 
Mosque, under the baton of Wil­
liam Steinberg, the 26th season of 
the Pittsburgh Symphony orches­
tra marks the debut of a conductor 
of internation fame. Called from 
Frankfurt to be the first conductor 
of the Israel Philharmonic orches­
tra and later personally appointed 
by Toscanini to be associate con­
ductor of the great NBC Symphony 
orchestra, Steinberg comes to 
Pittsburgh justly celebrated as one 
of the foremost conductors of our 
time.

day afternoon, the Kiltie band and 
ROTC honor guard will escort the 
Homecoming queen to the field. 
The Kiltie band will be supple­
mented by the Case band that aft­
ernoon.
Semi-Formal Dance
The culmination of the week­
end will be the semi-formal in the 
gym. Dancing in the big gym will 
be to the danceable strains of 
Baron Elliot’s 12 piece band. For 
relaxation and listening pleasure 
in the women's gym Walt Harper 
and his jazz combo will play dur­
ing the evening. Refreshments 
will be on sale in Thistle hall. 
The evening is planned to satisfy 
everyone at a reasonable cost. 
The exact price of the tickets will 
be announced shortly.

Playhouse Opens 
With Production 
“Ah! Wilderness*’
Saturday evening marked the of­
ficial opening of the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse’s 1952-1953 season with 
the first performance of the Eu­
gene O’Neill comedy, “Ah, Wilder­
ness,” and was presented at the 
new Craft avenue theater.
On Saturday evening the Pitts­
burgh Playhouse came into a new 
era of community theater progress 
with a new plant housing two the­
aters and the very latest in equip­
ment. This 19th season promises to 
be the biggest ever out on Craft 
avenue.
Director Frederick Burleigh has 
chosen this comedy by Eugene 
O’Neill because it has truly been 
one of the great plays of the last 
20 years. William G. Ball, Tech 
drama student, and Joan Jarratt 
play featured roles in the season’s 
opener.
“Ah, Wilderness” was world- 
premiered at the old Nixon thea­
ter in September 1933.
Library Seen 
By Reporter
By Sheila Sullivan
After last week’s article on the 
library, I climbed the three flights 
of stairs to see what I had been 
missing. Astounded by the obsta­
cle course arrangement of the ta­
bles, I went in to interview Mr. 
Fagerhaugh, the new head of the 
CIT library..
Mr.' Fagerbaugh was interested 
in presenting the library’s side of 
the story and told me that many 
plans have been considered in re­
gards to cutting through the steel 
doors at the head of the stairs. 
Cutting slots in the door to ac­
commodate books and making one 
of the glass panes smaller have 
been under consideration, but 
nothing concrete is seen for the 
immediate future. The new ar­
rangement of the tables has ex­
cited much criticism, but as he 
explained it has increased the 
seating capacity.’
It is also hoped that the new 
arrangement will deter many stu­
dents without serious business in 
the library from using the aisles 
as a public thoroughfare. This 
does not mean that students are 
not welcomed, but it is hoped that 
the students who try to study will 
get a better return from their ef­
fort with a decrease in noise and 
confusion.
Roger Williams 
Fellowship Group 
To Have Meeting
At the Thursday night supper 
meeting of the Roger Williams Fel­
lowship on October 9, Mayor 
David Lawrence will address the 
group. His topic, in line with the 
fellowship’s fall semester theme, 
“Christian Citizenship in an Elec­
tion Year,” will be “Practical Po­
litical Action.” The meeting will 
be held at the First Baptist church 
in Oakland on the corner of Belle- 
field and Bayard streets. The 
meeting will begin at 6:00 p.m.
The Roger Williams Fellowship 
is an intercollegiate, interfaith so­
cial discussion group which meets 
every Thursday night. All students 
are welcome.
Reservations for the Thursday 
night dinner may be made by call­
ing the Baptist student headquar- 
te at MA 1-7821. The price of the 
dinner is 75 cents. All students in­
terested in a stimulating and en­
lightening discussion on practical 
political matters in this critical 
year are welcome.

Varied needs of 71 Du Pont plants pose 
a host of original power problems
Heart of Du Pont’s manufacturing 
program is the power plant. To make 
some 1200 products and product lines 
the Company operates 71 plants.
Most require steam and electric 
generation, water supply and treat­
ment, heat exchangers, piping sys­
tems and related services. The de- 
signing’of these power plants, their 
erection and operation are all in the 
hands of engineers, the great majority 
being mechanical engineers.
But this is not the most interest­
ing thing about power work here. 
What challenges the highest skills of 
the engineer at Du Pont is the wealth 
of original problems constantly aris­
ing. Power requirements vary enor­
mously, not only from plant to plant 
but from time to time.
Process operating pressures may 
range from over 15,000 psi. to 2 mm 
of mercury, electrical requirements

Washington State '24, and A. S. Noell, Jr., 
B.S. in E.E., Duke *51, discuss the power 
acquirements of a new processing area.
Thi* powerhouse for a nylon plant at Martinsville, Va., ivas designed by Du Pont engineers. 
It houses two 135,000 lb./hr. boilers and two 7,500 KW extraction turbine generators.
from as low as 7,000 to higher than 
1 million KWH/day, and tempera­
tures from —360° to over 3,500°F.
Here are examples of recent "off- 
the-beaten-path” power problems.
1. A plant using natural gas as its basic 
fuel produces a waste oil of variable hy­
drocarbon composition and a waste gas 
with only 110 Btu/cu. ft. DuPont M.E.’s 
designed burners, fans, boilers and com­
bustion controls to permit use of all 
three fuels for generating steam.
2. At another plant 20,000 gpm of cool­
ing water were to be drawn from a nearby 
river. Since the water level fluctuated 
40 feet between normal and flood stages, 
it was necessary to evaluate several plans 
for pump-house constructions against 
cooling towers. The engineers installed 
a unique pump house whose submerged 
vertical pumps operate even when the 
structure is entirely under water.
Aside from design and construc­
tion, Du Pont mechanical engineers 
concern themselves with such related 
subjects as economic evaluations, 
equipment selection, heat balances, 
load calculations, waste heat boilers.
For example, where various process 
temperatures from 300° to 600°F. were 
required, Dowtherm was selected as the 
supply medium at the rate of 35 million 
Btu/hr. The engineers installed a central 
system for primary supply because it 
calculated to be more economical than 
separately located vaporizers.
On the operational side, M.E.’s 
supervise the supply of power and 
services. They establish performance 
standards and analyze equipment for 
results, cost and maintenance.

California Tech '47, and Byron R. Brown 
(center), B.S. in M.E., New Hampshire '49, 
supervise adjustment of furnace conditions in 
a study of power-plant efficiency.
Whether viewed from the design 
and construction side or the opera­
tional side, the diversity of Du Pont’s 
manufacture offers a wealth of op­
portunities in power work for the me­
chanical engineer.

Letters—
Need Frosh Spirit
Open Letter To Freshmen:
Within the next few weeks, you must decide 
year. There are seven positions to be filled—presi­
dent, secretary, treasurer and one vice-president 
who are to be the freshman class officers of this 
each from E & S, H & S, MMCC, and Fine Arts.
The enthusiasm with which the class of ’56 en­
ters into the coming election can have a profound 
influence upon the success of class organizations 
this year and in the ones following. It is no secret 
that the class organization program is badly in 
need of some life and spirit. You freshmen are in : 
a position to supply these.
So far I have spoken only in generalities; spe- j 
cifically, you as freshmen can do the following! 
things to make your class organization the best at 
CIT:
1. Turn in a petition if you art at all interested 
in holding an office. Remember, this is an excel­
lent place to start if you intend to be prominent in 
activities. Petitions are available in the Dean of 
Students office and are due no later than 4:30 
p.m. Friday, October 10.
2. Campaign vigorously. There is no substitute 
for putting your name before the public eye. A 
letter will be sent to all candidates regarding the 
availability of the Tartan. WRCT, and the bulletin 
boards for publicity.
3. Get out and vote October 22!! The Home­
coming queen as well as freshmen class officers 
will be elected at this time.
Come on, freshmen, let’s see some of the same 
spirit that gave us a painted senior walk and nail- 
studded and painted senior fence!!

Feels At Home
Editor, the Tartan:
Last month I went the way of all Carnegie 
hopefuls, signing, it seemed, my life away. They 
took my picture, my last $1.25 (for we all know 
that), and I along with 2,000 others became a part 
of CIT. All the regulars “clued” us on everything 
from the Carnegie plan to why they didn't call to­
night.
But now our verdancy has become a little less 
violent. We know more or less which turn to take, 
who has an elevator key, and that the Tartan 
comes out on Tuesdays.
We also know that our choice of college was a 
wise one. For my classmates I thank all of you 
who have made Carnegie a part of us.
Sincerely,
A Frosh.
Less Platform Nonsense
EDITOR’S NOTE: The above letter was receiv­

In the future we will require that each letter 
be signed. However, if the author doesn’t want 
his name published, but wishes to ‘coin’ a signa­

It’s about that time of year when we have to begin 
eating our meals under the shadows of campaign posters 
and smudge some candidate’s name across our face while 
wiping our mouth. To most of the students it seems that 
elections are a traditional part of college life, but it also 
seems that many of the candidates don’t take to campus 
politics with this idea (not to differentiate between students 
and candidates). There’s a traditional SOP in seeking an 
office at Carnegie Tech, and to the outside observer, it ap­
pears to be quite backward—become nominated and then 
pick an intangible platform.
Using the freshman class elections of the past as our 
prime example, let’s follow the evolution of a bewildered 
frosh from registration to the soap box. Following consid­
erable pressure upon this potential candidate by Dorm Coun­
cil or his fraternity pledgemaster, he runs to the Dean’s 
office, gets the petition, and quickly collects the signatures. 
After recruiting numerous others to aid is using up all the 
paint and wrapping paper given him, he suddenly is faced 
with a serious dilema—he needs a platform.
Here is where this dodo bird aspect begins; we could 
have a much better system of class organizations on this 
campus if those attempting to hold the reins of the class had 
entered the fray with an intention of some definite accom­
plishment. Although platforms appear non-sensical to those 
haters of SocRel, they are the difference between an effective 
organization and a bunch of title holders. Common practice 
around this campus is for each contender to latch onto some 
meaningless topic such as more dances, stronger alumni re- 
I lations after graduation, or better consideration of student 
problems by the administration. Wonderful as these soun<J, 
they’re very impractical; no one faction, regardless of its 
sincerity, can hope to renovate the .school in nine months.
Except for the drawback of committing themselves be-
I yond their limits in an area where they can be held account­
able, there isn’t any reason why the future class officers can’t 
j come out with a platfprm that will handle a campus problem 
within their scope, instead of doing nothing all year but try­
ing to assemble enough students to hold a class meeting. 
This year we’ve seen the first class president in Student 
Council meetings since the privilege was granted officers to 
become non-voting Councilmen. The remainder have been j 
content to wear the title and accomplish nothing.
Each year the freshmen are confused about several 
phases of campus life, and if their class officers could hold 
to such a simple platform as being the guiding light, they 
would be well worth their salt. There are so many frosh who 
would be glad to aid the campus activities if only pushed a 
little, and even a lightly organized class could accomplish 
this. Or, they would spend the whole year outlining a more 
complete plan of freshman regulations to be enforced by them 
next year, the whole program would benefit. But there is 
not a good reason in the world why we should take an in­
terest in electing officers who only use the position for their 
personal fame and activities points. The voters are not the 
only ones liable for the poor tun j at the poll, our past 
officers must shoulder a lot of this blame.
Inquiring Reporter—
Ideas On Regulations
by Ken Winston
This week’s question asked by the inquiring 
reporter was as follows: Do you think that att 
freshman regulations, such as the wearing at 
“dinks,” etc., should be strictly enforced. Can you 
suggest any changes or improvements in frosh 
regulations?”
Paul Zeigler, freshman civil engineering- -“The 
taking of the traditions test is 
one regulation which should be 
required because all students of 
Carnegie Tech should become 
acquainted with their school’s 
history, fraternities, sororities, 
student government, etc. If they 
were not required to take this 
test, many students would not be 
familiar with their school. It 
would be embarrassing to them 
if asked by outsiders just what 
went on at Carnegie in the way of student or­
ganization, the present setup,of the school, etc.
“One regulation which I do not think should 
be enforced is that of wearing dinks. Freshmen have 
come to college to learn and not wear a silly little 
cap. The name plates which are on the dinks are 
a good idea for it affords the upper-classmen and 
fellow classmates a chance to become acquainted 
with each other.
“As far as the senior walk and senior fence are 
concerned, if the seniors want something to hold 
for themselves or is very dear to their heart, then 
let them set aside these things for their own use.* 
Corky Dunn, sophomore Home Economics— 
“There are simple regulations 
for Freshman to follow which 
have been set up for a good pur­
pose. The fun of being a Fresh­
man is going through the small 
initiations demanded by the 
school.
“Looking around at freshies 
on Carnegie Tech campus, it is 
V |T ||| quite evident that rules set up 
lit for our Sreen newcomers are 
being abused. Senior walk ie 
poluted with frosh and the forbidden fence is a 
popular meeting place for them. Dinks are the 
main way to identify and introduce Frosh to up­
per class men; yet few bother to wear them.
“It is a part of college life and good sports­
manship to go through the small trivialities of the 
Freshmen regulations. If they aren’t willing to 
take them in their stride, we should be able to have 
the power of enforcing them.”
Lou Valoppi, sophomore electrical engineer 
“The wearing of dinks and name 
tags is standard procedure for 
freshman at almost all colleges 
throughout the country. I think 
Tech is one of the more lenient 
schools regarding the enforce­
ment of the wearing of the dinks 
and tags. I can see nothing 
wrong with this attitude of leni­
ency but I feel that the other 
regulations such as compulsory 
attendance of pep rallies and 
football games should be strictly enforced. If these 
two regulations could be enforced, ‘school spirit* 
of Tech would soar. At football games the students' 
response is very poor. The reason for this is that 
most of the student body does not know the cheers. 
Every student, freshman or otherwise, should make 
it a point to learn the cheers and really give out 
at the games.
“A student who comes to Tech must be inter­
ested in the school and should learn everything he 
can about the institution he is attending. There 
should be no reason to threaten failure of the tra­
ditions exam in order to make Freshman do this.** 
Frances Di Matteo, freshman drama—“Frankly,
I do thinki the Freshman regu­
lations should be more strictly 
enforced. Hardly any Freshmen 
are still wearing their dinks. 
Maybe its because we think the 
idea is to make us feel inferior, 
but it is not. The dinks are to 
help us. Being new in the school, 
we need help in finding our way 
around. We didn’t arrive know­
ing where every room in the 
building is and where every 
building on the campus is either. If we wear our 
dinks, it will help the upperclassmen to help us.
I think the name tags are a terrific idea. It gives 
me a wonderful feeling to go by someone and have 
them call me by name. My memory for names is 
terrible and that’s where the name tags come in 
very handy again. The only trouble is I can’t 
see the tags of people over 5 feet tali (I’m four 
feet eleven)”.

Players of the Week
ED KARCHER, who won 
all city honorable mention 
while playing for Carrick 
High last year, has nailed 
down the first string defen­
sive line backing position.
His terrific hustling was a 
decided factor in upsetting 
the precision passing of “Bul­
let Bob” Decker, Bethany’s 
football hero . . . outstanding 
single play was Iiis drive to 
the five yard line after inter­
cepting Decker’s pass on the 
twenty.
Freshman halfback BYRON 
EISAMAN, of East McKees­
port, scored two touchdowns, 
one on a 19 yard off tackle 
thrust, and he led the offen­
sive unit in the Plaid’s 27-12 
victory over Bethany.
“Firin’ ” Byron was switch­
ed by Coach Baker from de­
fensive to offensive halfback 
and proved the good doctor’s 
decision to be a wise one. 
Eisaman, already “living” in 
Johhny Luchok’s jersey, may 
be the answer to Baker’s 
prayers for someone to fill 
Luchok’s shoes as well.
Double E Wins Contest

Welch hall. Five other students 
were close with eleven right se­
lections, but were all thrown off 
by one of the m^ny upsets over 
the nation.
Missed Three
Mike predicted three contests 
erroneously; he chose Texas over 
Notre Dame, Washington over 
UCLA, and Rice over LSU.
Last week’s winner, Frank Car­
ter, was close again with eleven 
right oux of fifteen.
The Carnegie Tech Tartans chalked up their first win of the foot­
ball season by traveling to Wellsburg, West Virginia, and defeating 
Bethany, 27-12. This was the Clan’s tenth win in eleven meetings 
in a series that dates back to 1912.

Tartans1 Outrun Jeannette, 
21-34; Meet Covies Next
At 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, October 4, the Tartan harriers whipped*-
a weak Jeannette squad, 21-34. Four year veteran and this year’s 
captain, Bob Carman, copped first place honors with a time o 19:35, 
which is just 18 seconds over the official record of 19:17 which he 
set last week. ?--------------------------------------------------------
Chuck Fee, who placed second in 
the meet with 19:46, paced Carman 
by about 150 yards for the first 
half of the 3.8 mile course through 
Schenley park, -but a hard driving 
finish gave Carman the edge by 
11 seconds.
Sophomore navy veteran, Male 
Gillis, placed third, dropping be­
hind Jeannette’s Fee by about haflf 
a minute. Gillis appears to be one 
of the brightest spots in this sea­
son’s prospects for Coach Guy Hal- 
ferty. Arnie Olds, a junior from 
Oregon who earned a letter this 
spring running the two-mile event 
for the track team, pulled down 
the fourth spot.
Fine Newcomers 
Two newcomers to the Plaid 
crosscountry team are Rog Coyle
and Jim Flynn. Both of these men 
ran on collegiate scholarships last 
year and show great promise of 
becoming two of the best runners 
Tech has had in many years. Coyle 
ran last year at Pitt; Flynn at Penn 
State. Against Jeannette they fin­
ished inxa tie for seventh place 
with 22:51.
Houser of Jeannette was the 
only visitor besides Fee to rank in 
the first ten. His time of 21:51 
threw him into the fifth spot be­
hind Carnegie’s A1 Hayews with 
22:28.
John Muller, another veteran 
and transfer from the track squad, 
also ran last Saturday. His time 
of 23:05 was very disappointing. 
Last year he ran the same course 
in 22:30 and Coach Halferty was
hind a hard charging line which 
opened up big holes, gained 317 
yards on the ground. The defense 
also sparkled as they held the 
Bison’s Bobby Decker to nine com­
pletions out of twenty attempts, 
while intercepting three.
Irv Schecter led the offense in 
the first half by amassing a total of 
94 yards. In the second half Byron 
Eisaman, with 76 yards, and Tom 
Warner, with 42 yards, were the 
standouts. Gil Dissen, besides 
gaining 47 yards on the ground, 
Contributed highly to the victory 
with terrific kickoffs, the first two 
of which went into the end zone, 
and his three out of four extra 
points.
Guy Carricato got the only TD 
of the first half on a quarterback 
sneak from the two. In the third 
quarter, he repeated from the one 
yard line.
Freshman Eisaman also carried 
to paydirt twice in the second half.
This gave the Skibo eleven a 
substantial lead when George 
Taba' of Bethany broke loose 
around right end for a 72 yard 
scoring jaunt. Decker passed con­
tinually but was not rewarded un­
til an aerial to Bob Boyer along 
the right sideline went for 65 yards 
and the Bison’s last TD late in the 
fourth quarter.
Griffiths Intercepts
The Bison’s took the opening 
kickoff and proceeded to march 
down the field, but the attack 
bogged wyhen Chuck Griffiths 
grabbed a Decker pass on the Tech 
10. The Scot’s took over and thir­
teen plays and 90 yards later, Car­
ricato crossed for the TD. A pass 
from Carricato to Tom Craig, who 
lateraled to Schecter, was the big 
gainer in the march.
The rest of the half the teams 
battled back and forth, losing the 
ball on downs several times. 
Craig’s 80 yard boot was the kick j 
of the game and during the last 
play of the half he made a circus | 
catch before being knocked out of j 
bounds.
An exchange of punts started j 
the second half; then Eisamen | 
came in for Schecter, who had 
sparkled with seventeen carries in 
the first half, and the Plaid began 
to move. The pass to Craig, lateral
to Eisaman play gained 26 yards 
before Carricato again bucked the 
line for the second score.
Karcher Intercepts
On the first play after the kick- 
off, Ed Karcher intercepted a 
Decker Pass on the 20 and re­
turned it to the 5, but the Plaid 
were halted when on fourth down 
they missed a 20 yard field goal 
attempt.
The third Scot six-pointer was 
set up by Gil Dissen’s 31 yard run, 
after the Tartans took Decker’» 
quick kick on their own 39. Eisa­
man got 10 yards in three plays; 
then, Bill Kennedy passed to Ed 
Ziegenfuss on the 4. From here, 
Eisaman bowled over for the score. 
Dissen missed his firgt conversion 
attempt this season, and the score 
was 20-0.
A short kick by Decker from hii 
goal line gave the Tartans the 
pigskin deep in green and white 
territory. After two TD’s were 
recalled because of penalties, Eisa­
man finally went 18 yards into the 
end zone. Dissen converted as the 
bulge was widened to 27-0.
On the second play after the 
kickoff, Tabai, Bison halfback, 
dashed around right end and out­
ran the CIT defense for the game'* 
longest run and the opposition’* 
first score. Eisaman blocked the 
extra point attempt.
DeVries Intercepts
The Tartans started to move up

intercepted to stop the drive. How­
ever, on the next play, Roy 
DeVries snatched a long Decker 
pass to gain possession for Car­
negie. Then with only a few min­
utes remaining, Decker heaved the 
long pass to Boyer for the game’s 
last touchdown. Decker missed hi* 
second conversion, and Tech held 
the ball for the remaining time.

Meet Geneva
This Friday, October 10, the 
Harriers will travel to Geneva .col­
lege for their second contest of the 
season. The Covies were drubbed 
by Pitt on Saturday, 15-48. Pitt’s 
leading runner paced the course at 
23:28, and Geneva’s top entry 
George Jackson finished fifth in 
24:29. In spite of the advantage 
of the home course, it is highly un­
likely that the Covies will make 
any kind of impression on the 
Plaid delegation.
Due to the increased interest on

of these competitions will be

tmtramural Roundup
Tau Delts, Newman9 Delts 
Continue Unbeaten Play
Tau Delta Phi, Newman Club, 
and Delta Tau Delta all posted 2 
and 0 records at the completion of 
the first full week of intramural 
play.
Kiltie League
The Tau Delts took a half-game 
lead over the Sigma Nu’s by down­
ing erstwhile contenders, Phi Kap­
pa, 23-19, last Thursday on the 
FPHA field. Paced by Don Weav­
er's passing to Paul Bernstein and 
E. Winnick, the winners were 
»ever headed. Although the Phi 
Kappa threatened in the final 
stages, the Tau Delts were equal 
to the occasion and took home the 
Victory.
The Sigma Nu’s stayed right be­
hind the Tau Delts in the loop 
standings by crushing the “Great­
est” six on Monday, 31-2. Jim 
Holthaus’ passing featured in the 
victory.
Tartan League
The Newman Club showed a 
strong defense in downing Kappa 
Sigma, 6-2, and SAE, 5-3. Previ­
ous league leader Beta Sigma Rho 
was upset by Delta Upsilon in the 
most decisive encounter, 25-16. The 
DU’s overcame a third period de­
ficit, 15-14, to drop the highly tout­
ed Beta Sigs. The passing of Rob­
bins coupled with O’Reilly’s re­
ceiving stood out as the offensive 
power.
Paced by Jack Brourman’s bul­
let passes, BSR came right back 
into the title picture by knocking 
off the perennially powerful 
Emanon, 28-17.
SAE set back Kappa Sigma in 
an also-ran contest, 20-9.
Skibo League
Last year’s champions, Delta 
Tau Delta, were off to a running 
start again this year as they first 
downed the ME’s 22-6 and then 
runner-up Beta Theta Pi, 27-15.
The Beta’s copped a thrilling 
19-18 victory over PiKA after 
holding them for four downs on 
the half yard line with two min­
utes remaining and then complet­
ing a pass for the game winning 
first down.
Sparked by quarterback Russ 
Eastwood, Theta Xi nailed down 
its first victory, also, at the ex­
pense of PiKA, 29-2. Poor passing 
and a weak defense hindered the 
PiKA’s.
Scottie League
In the only game played in the 
league, the ATO’s overwhelmed 
Sigma Nu “B,”, 53-0. Bart Bartocci 
connected for five touchdown 
passes to Willie Blake to account 
for the bulk of the scoring.
* »JL** *
A LONG HEAVE
Phi Kappa's Satacrose is shown uncorking one of the many 
passes that helped his team win out over a weak Ropsip aggregation. 
Down on all fours after attempting to block his man is Phi Kap 
Mike Marquez. Currently the Phi Kaps are leading the race in the 
Scottie league, but they are ranked 10th in the Tartan ratings, which 
cover the entire intramural program.

When Carnegie Tech lost its grid opener to the California State 
Vulcans a few weeks back, they also lost their chances of completing 
their first undefeated season. In forty-four years of intercollegiate 
competition the Tartans have never had an all winning season.
The best record the Skibos can boast is a 7-1 log com­
piled four times; in 1915, 1928, 1938, and 1950.
Many of us remember the 1950 campaign when the Tartans 
rolled over Davis-Elkins, Bethany, Akron, Allegheny, Case, W&J, and 
Westminster, only to be crushed by Lehigh, 66-0. This humiliating 
defeat, by the way, was the worst beating suffered in Plaid history.
The Tartan football machine of 1938 was, in the opinion 
of many, the grtatest to wear the Cameron plaid. Their per­
fect record was marred by a 7-0 defeat at the hands of the 
mighty “fighting Irish” from Notre Dame. Nevertheless, this 
Tartan squad received the Lambert trophy, emblematic of 
the eastern football championship, and then went to the 
Sugar, Bowl where they dropped a “mythical championship” 
to Texas Christian University. 15-7. This same year, Coach 
William F. Kern was honored with the Coach of the Year 
award.
One of the greatest upsets in football history came when Car­
negie Tech trounced Notre Dame, 19-0, at Forbes field in 1926. This 
was the only defeat suffered by the Knute Rockne eleven in that 
year.
In 1928, the Tartans traveled to Carter field where they again 
inflicted a defeat, 27-7, upon Notre Dame. This was the first time 
that the Irish had been beaten on their home field in 22 years.
Carnegie’s overall record stands at 160 wins, 168 losses,, and 21 
ties. We have had two All-Americans: tackle Floyd Yoder in 1926 
and quarterback Howard Harpster in 1928.
Under the current football regime the gridders sacrifice athletic 
power for scholarship. Although they are forced to take a back seat 
in the nation-wide publicity market, the Plaid continues to win ball 
games for Coach Eddie Baker. During the past three years the Tar­
tans have won 14 out of 18 class B contests. At this rate Carnegie 
gridders will have bolstered their all time record over the .500 mark 
by 1953. WE HOPE!!
On the basis of past perform­
ances, the ATO squad seems the 
most formidable entry in the in-

Evening Student Council Holds 
First Event Of School Year
An Authentic Monte Carlo Party Is Planned 
For Enjoyment Of Evening School Students
The first social event of the current school year is drawing very 
close. Have you married students made your arrangements for a 
baby sitter for Saturday, October 18? And you single folks, how 
about bringing your date to this affair? Yes, one week from this 
Saturday, Evening Student Coun-^--------------------------------------------------------
cil will sponsor their second Monte 
Carlo Carnival. Every one is in­
vited—day and evening students 
alike.
A White Elephant auction will 
also be held at the carnival. White 
elephants are articles you don't 
need but something someone else
open for an evening of dancing 
and refreshments.
Just think, all this for only 75 
cents. More yet, everyone at­
tending will receive $1,000 cash 
at the door upon entering. Addi­
tional $1,000 bundles can be pur­
chased at any time throughout the
could use. Donations to the White evening for 25 cents each
Elephant auction may be left at 
Mr. McKelway’s office or given 
to Marcell Sessi or Don Walker. 
The White Elephants will be auc­
tioned off for stage money only.
To round off the evenings’ fes- 
'l tivities, roulette wheels, dice 
games, and Casino can be enjoyed 
„ by all in the Thistle Hall. The 
Black Cat Lounge will also be

Tech Wives Club 
Starting Drive 
For Membership
It has recently been brought to 
our attention that the Tech Wives 
club is an organization which in­
vites the wives of all Tech stu­
dents, day or evening, to become 
members and participate in its ac­
tivities. Since so few of the even­
ing students know of this club, 
it was thought that an article in 
the Plaid might arouse considera­
ble interest.
A meeting will be held on Tues­
day, October 7 at 8 p.m. in the 
Carnegie Union. It is realized that 
by the time this edition reaches 
most of the students, this meeting 
will have already taken place. 
However, if sufficient interest is 
shown in this organization, this 
paper will endeavor to make it a 
point to publicize the date of fu- 
ture meetings.
Help
Any evening school student 
interested in working on Plaid 
staff should come to the Union 
Friday evenings.

workers for the party. It is for­
tunate, I think, that similar things 
cannot happen in this country.
He called these people fanatics, 
and told us that our country needs 
“devoted followers” to offset the 
Russian strength. The difference 
between fanaticism and devotion 
was not made clear.
Three Questions
All this time, I might add, sev­
eral graduate research assistants 
watched the proceeding, measuring 
the period, amplitude, and heat 
loss from friction as the orator os­
cillated and gestured on the stand. 
A bewildered freshman, thinking 
still that he was in class, gasped, 
“So that’s Mr. Birdy!”
Then came the unanswerable 
question. They were: human de­
pravity, human sorrow, and death. 
These hardly seem like questions 
from here, but more like empirical 
facts. Nevertheless they were said 
to be questions by the gentleman 
in questions, so I suppose they 
must be.
Won’t Change
The speaker tied all these things 
loosely together by promising us a 
solution to his questions through 
his interpretation of religious phi­
losophy. I understand, in fact, 
from those who have heard him 
speak at a nearby sports arena, 
that he is proud of the fact that his 
views will remain fixed no matter 
what is said, proved, or how the 
world progresses.
used in favor of a 1908 Stanley
steamer.
“Many, Many”
He wound up the whole thing by 
requesting that anyone whom he 
had convinced (or reconvinced) of 
these things raise their hands. Due 
to an unfortunate coincidence, we 
all sat With bowed heads while 
this went on, so I cannot quote fig­
ures on the procedude. But from 
his cries of “yes, yes, many, many,” 
I judge that the number was sub­
stantial. It was not quite substan­
tial enough, however, to warrant 
a mass movement to the speaker’s 
stand (as also happened at the 
sports arena) of these new devot­
ed followers. No showing, I guess, 
is better than a poor one.
So the meeting adjourned, some 
of us going to lunch, others to 
class, and I to a particularly 
knotty 16th century parchment on 
the phlogiston theory.
