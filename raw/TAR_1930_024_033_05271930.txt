PUPPET STAFF TO 
GIVE SCHOLARSHIP
The Puppet staff announces its 
intentio'n of awarding a $100 schol­
arship to its most w'orthy con­
tributor during the first semester of 
next year. The competition will be 
open' to all sophomores "and fresh­
men in all four of the colleges dur­
ing the first semester, the scholar­
ship to be awarded to the winner 
who is to be selected by the staff 
for the second semester. The con­
tributors • for the past year are 
urged to keep up the good work 
they haye been- doing. The staff 
has initiated a' new policy of plac­
ing-the initials . of all contributors 
not holding major or minor offices 
-—whose contributions are more 
than a. half-page in length—beneath 
their articles. A more definite plan 
of the scholarship-competition will 
be announced, in the “Freshman 
Number,” the first publication of 
the magazine next year, which will 
go on sale on September 16.
Thistles Will Go 
On Sale Tomorrow 
At Y.M.C.A. Office
Preliminary sale of the new Car­
negie Thistle will be conducted 
from-the Y. . M. C. A. office start­
ing tomorrow, May 28, at noon.
Among the many features of this 
year’s book will be the prodigous 
green-ink sketches of the campus, 
the georgeous purple-hued cover, 
an augmented Night section, a 
large athletic division, and a large 
number of photographs of the fra­
ternities, the band, the football and 
basketball teams, and other or­
ganizations.
The flaring green-ink sketches of 
Campus * -scenes* will probably be 
the most unusual feature of the 
Thist-ie. These have been drawn 
by Mildred Young, class of ’28, 
who is now employed by the Can­
ton Engraving Company; she has 
been enrolled in the P. & D. De­
partment.
Cover To Be Unusual
The Thistle cover is consider­
ed to; be. one of the ino.st attrac­
tive that has' yet been used on Car­
negie year-books of the past. The 
idcsign is of a Scotchman in a kil­
tie on a background of deep purple, 
the thistle .color. The other fine 
art work and pictures within the 
book itself arc just as excellent as 
the cover design, for -which Ed­
mund Ash, Art Editor, is 'to be 
complimented.
Of the 256 pages that make up 
the complete Thistle, 40 hace been 
given to the Athletic Section, 
which has. been compiled by George 
Suitt. In this section will be found 
complete writeups of all the games, 
together with many fijic football 
and basketball team pictures. Wo­
men’s athletics will. also, be repre­
sented by pictures of the champion 
teams of each sport.
In this j'car book more space 
than usual has been given to the 
Night Section, in which there will 
be pictures of the -Niglit seniors,

Benefit Next Fall
The organization has formally 
decided, following the example this 
year, to have an individual artist 
rather than select a play for the 
Benefit performance next year. It 
was further decided to present the 
performance in the fall instead of 
in the spring. Nancy Newman has 
been appointed Chairman of the 
Play Selection Committee, and will 
have a list of available artists ready 
for the first 'meeting in the fall.
Scholarships Awarded Next Fall
The scholarships will be awarded 
next semester by the Scholarship 
Committee, of which Dean Tarbcll 
is Chairman, to students of high 
scholastic achievement, as well as 
to those who need financial aid 
and have proven themselves 
worthy of it. This year the Wo­
men’s Scholarship Organization 
earned . ?400 to be given in $50 
scholarships. A plan is being con­
sidered for setting aside a part of 
that $400 to establish a trust fund. 
That would make possible a per­
petual source from which to award 
scholarships. “The Women’s Schol­
arship Organization will welcome 
the contributions of any campus 
organization to this trust fund.
Announcements Range From Delight of Crooked 
Politics to Thrill of Notre Dame Back-Yard Defeat
Katherine Anderson
“The happiest moment of my life 
occurred April 1,. 1930, when the 
exposure of my underhand dealing.; 
with the Women’s Scholarship Or­
ganization was published. From 
the time the scheme was conceived, 
the baseness of the deed preyfcd 
upon me. But the prospect o; 
financial gain stilled my nobler 
impulses. The lucrc, however, did 
not appease my conscience and 1 
confessed. Since then, life has 
taken on a new happiness.” 
Catherine Boyd 
“There were two ‘happiest’ days- 
in my college career, the day that 
I resigned from Student Council 
and the day that I was able to 
expose nefarious dealings of tlu 
Women’s Scholarship Organization. 
My relief when my resignation was 
finally accepted was immeasurable 
and my joy was unconfincd when- 
the chairman *of the Scholarship 
Organization was finally brought 
to justice.”
Blanche Bray
“There have been many happy 
moments during my career at Car­
negie. Fulfilled aspirations and 
small .successes have left a pleasant 
memory, but tlic greatest moment 
is yet to come. When I have re­
ceived my diploma and have said 
my last farewell, the height of 
happiness will have been reached."
Simon Feigenbaum 
“My happiest moment at Car­
negie occurred when I discovered 
that the modus opcrandi of higher 
education consisted of huge
amounts of palaver, cajolery, and
the kindred arts, combined with 
trivial bits of acadcmic effort. It 
was a great.relief to know that the 
profcssoriat really did not cxpcct
any one to do more than 25 per
ccnt of the work assigned/’
Additional Thistle

ning Frcshmair Week. The Mar­
garet Morrison -Plebe Regulations

Other business consisted of the

R. O. T. C. furnish instruments 
for the Kiltie Band. It was also

“If I were . to say very much 
about my happiest Carnegie mo­
ment, she might raise a fuss, so 
we’ll omit that, and say that our 
happiest moment Came when Jcrrv 
McGcorgc told the world at large 
how happy we had made Carnegie’s 
bits of femininity. We hope they 
all hear of his announcement, and, 
if they do, w.c’ll sec if Dr. Rittman 
knew whereof lie spoke when lie 
said, 'Advertising pays.’ Cluck! 
Cluck!”
William Johns
“People with senses' of humor 
laugh and get fat. If they laugh 
too much, "they smoke Luckies to 
remove the • superfluous flesh. I 
once took a fat girl to a tea dance 
and got the opportunity of seeing 
the most elaborate cigarette - cases 
on campus—the cases for my ben­
efit and the cigarettes for my fat 
lady’s friends. What a life for a 
temperamental artist!”
Isobel Sheppard 
"It would be impossible for me 
lo estimate the pleasure I have de­
rived from four years at Carnegie 
Tech, in terms of moments, hours 
days—or events! It has been a 
cumulative process in which some 
outstanding events have add­
ed more happiness, but in which all 
contributed to ,thc final impression 
of four years delightfully spent."
Andrew Yerina 
“27 to 7. Do you remember 
what that was and what is meant? 
Well, that was the scorc by which 
Carnegie Tech defeated Notre 
Dame. After that game .was over, 
I believe I spent the happiest mo­
ment of my college career chuck­
ling over beating the Irish in 
llheir own back yard—the first time 
'it had been done in 27 years.

LITTLE THEATER’S 
NEXT PRODUCTION 
IS 3 ACT COMEDY
“Why Not” Will Be Pre­
sented By Drama Dept. 
This Friday
Why Not, a comedy in three acts 
by Jesse Lynch Williams, will be 
presented- by members of the Drama 
Department under the direction of 
Mr. E. W. Hickman and will open 
on Friday evening, May 30, iu the 
Little Theater.
Mr. Willems, author of Why Not, 
is fond; of the play title that pro­
pounds a query. Some years ago he 
offered Why Marry which was award­
ed the Pulitzer -Prize for being the 
best American cbmcdy of that year. 
Why Not. is in no sense a sequel 
save, that it does treat divorcc with 
something, of the same philosophic 
levity superimposed upon a soundly, 
reasoned protest against existing di­
vorce laws and the acccptcd con­
ventions surrounding the corrcction 
of marital mistakes.' There is an ele­
ment of farce in the play which 
keeps it out of the "problem” class.
The story is -about two couplcs 
each with a child to think about,, 
cach with the highest religious ideals 
of conduct, and cach with the hearti­
est friendship for the other 'couplc. 
But, nevertheless, there , is the fact; 
plain to each, that a blunder has 
been niadc from the start, and that 
honesty and decency demand for 
cach woman and at least for one'man 
an exchange of husbands.
The whole problem of divorcc 
which- is brought into discussion by 
means' of a farcial- situation and 
which is by no means impossible, 
ceases to be a problem as soon as it 
is frankly faced and when stated is 
at once seen to be a clarification of 
the lives of four and their two chil­
dren.
The Equity Players of New York 
produced Why Not in the Forty- 
eighth Street Theater a few years 
ago. '
The cast of the play includes: 
Lcanard Chadwick, John Miller and 
Arthur Sprenkle; Mary, Frances 
Hcckert and Helen Hotham; Molly, 
Mathilda Bodycombc; Churchill 
Smith, George Phelps and Donn 
lionhoff; Jane Davidge, Pauline Baur- 
srriith and Esther Tcitlcbaum;, Eradne 
Thompson, Sally Franklin and Helen 
Tenney; Billy Thompson, George 
Hildegrand; Bill Thompson, Leo 
Dasclibach, Arne Bocscn.
Mr. E. W. Hickman, who is di-. 
rccting the play, is a new member 
of the Drama Department, having 
just come to Carnegie this year. His 
first production here was The Wild 
Duck by Hendrick Ibsen which was. 
produced during November. In Jan­
uary The Three Musketeers by Alex­
andre Dumas was presented under 
his direction,
The permanent class officers of 
the present Margaret Morrison Sen­
ior class, as a result of a recent 
election arc: . Margaret Kccnpy,
president; Virginia Kerr, secretary, 
and- Mildred Bàstian, alvimiii repre­
sentative.Margaret Kccnoy has been the 
Margaret Morrison Senior class

editor of Tri-Publications and Sen­
ior representative on the M. M. C.

president of the Margaret Morri­
son graduating class.
All of these officers will be grad­
uates of the Secretarial Depart­
ment, and they are already plan­
ning a reunion which will be held 
in the early fall. It has been a 
custom of every Margaret Morrison 
graduating class to elect permanent 
class officers before graduation.

fraterhity Council. The following men 
were selected to fill the open posi­
tions: president, Smedberg, member

Gililand, a Delta Tau Delta J secre­
tary, Eisen, a Beta Sigma Rho. 
These .men will go into office at 
the beginning of the coming school 
year.
"Hell Weeks” Curtailed
The curtailing bf "Hell . Weeks" 
was the major’ topic discusscd at 
this meeting. It was proposed that 
all initiations be restricted |o week 
ends and should be held within the 
'fraternity house. As it is not t.lv 
policy of the council to legislate in 
private fraternity ‘ affairs it was 
moved that 110 action be taken until 
next 'year when they could rcceive 
opinions from various fraternity 
groups. This discussion was .brought 
rabout from ,a short taHc 011 the sub­
ject of,.“Hell Weeks" (given by Dean 
llirig at the council meeting of May 
17.
Revisions of Constitution Adopted
The constitution revised according 
lo a motion made in last week’s meet­
ing is to be drawn up in full and 
submitted for approval. The revision 
consists of a change in Article Three 
which has been made to read that 
each fraternity ¿Wall' be represented 
by its president and ono member 
from the ‘Jlililpt class, the latter to 
be ‘ ap'poiiU'ed by the respective fra­
ternity president. The first semester 
president is to be the Council repre­
sentative foi1 the entire year and 
will therefore be 'eligible for the 
Intcr-fralcirnity Cotincil Representa­
tive Key. These revisions arc re­
quired by the new type council now 
in power.

member of Pi Delta Epsllson, 
Dragon, and treasurer of ¿Ipha 
I au Omega. The other members 
of the committee arc seniors, and 
include Henry Bunker, member of 
the Tartan Staff, Pi Delta Epsilon 
Fraternity, Tlicta Tau, and Drag­
on,; and Thomas Lippert, former 
editor of the Tartan.
In former years, it was the cus­
tom for the retiring seniors to 
spend several days immediately be­
fore Commencement iu a final pro­
gram of social events. It was 
found, however, that these exten­
sive inroads into the tiino' of the 
graduates was detrimental to their 
own interests and it was decided 
to. limit the celebrations to a few 
functions, and this has become 
usual during the last two years.
As the Commencement Ball is 
an open All-Carnegie dancc, it is 
hoped that all students will take 
this final'opportunity to enjoy the 
last event of the year with the 
graduating class.
Tlic Civil Engineering, Depart­
ment seniors were the first to 
pledge 100 per ccnt iii the scnior- 
alumni' membership campaign.. The 
Printing Department seniors arc 
also represented 100 per ccnt. The 
Class of 1930 is urged to aim at 
100 per cent alumni membership. 
Last year the 1929 Class was two- 
thirds paid ' up in its membership 
before the day bf .graduation.
Membership is secured by paying 
the fee of $2 at the Alumni Office, 
Room 206, in the Gymnasium 
building, before June 10.
The privileges of membership 
include subscriptions '.to'' the Tar­
tan and the Carnegie Alumnus, and 
to other literature of interest to 
alumni. Preference is given to 
Alumni in the choice of scats at 
all athletic event's. The association 
forms a connecting link between 
the graduates and -the colleges, as 
well as between the alumni them­
selves.

FACULTY PLANS FOR 
SUMMER ARE VARIED
The Carnegie Faculty is plan­
ning to spend the summer vacation 
in a variety of ways ranging from 
continued teaching to study and 
travel.
President Baker has been elected 
to membership in the American 
Committee of World Power Con­
ference which is to be held at 
Berlin in June. Dr. Alexander has 
been asked to represent the Car­
negie Institute of Technology at 
the meeting, as President Baker 
will not be able to attend. Dr. 
Leaker has accepted aii invitation" 
from, the-. Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology Club of Western 
Pennsylvania to attend its annual 
banquet at the University Club 011 
May 24.
Charles M. Meyers of the His­
tory Department has been engaged 
by the West Penn Power Com­
pany to conduct weekly tours 
through the Shenandoah Valley and 
Peninsula of Virginia during the , 
summer months. Mr. Meyers would/ 
be glad to explain details of the 
tour to any member of the faculty 
or their friends’ who may be con­
templating such a summer trip.
Dr. Watkins, director of Mar­
garet Morrison, is planning to 
spent a part of his vacation in 
Tenncssc.c. He leaves early in 
August with the intention of stop-' 
ping enroute to spend a week at 
his home on the coast of Mary­
land.
• Dean . Tarbcll expects to spend 
the greater part of the summer at 
his cottage on Cape Cod.
Mr. Lawler of the English De­
partment will study at the Uni­
versity of Chicago.
Miss Mary Watson Green, Dean 
of Women, has not yet announced 
any plans for this vacation.

Chicago Clan
The Chicago Clan had a very in­
teresting and successful meeting Mon­
day night, May 12, at the Allerton 
Club house. It was “Carnegie Tech” 
night over KYW between 6:30 and 
7:00 o’clock. Durirg ‘this period, 
while the clan was at dinner, the 
Allerton House Glee Club sang Car­
negie Tcch songs on the broadcast. 
C. B. Schmidt gave a two-minute 
talk on our Alma Mater, for the 
benefit of the Midwest.
After dinner a short business meet­
ing was held at which plans were 
made for "the year with the Notre 
Dame game of October 18 in view, 
.which will have a banner attendance 
of “Chicagoites." C. B. Schmidt was 
elected president and any one in the 
vicinity desiring news of other 
Alumni or whose name is not on 
the record, should communicate with 
him.
Thirty-four Alumni and their hus­
bands and wives were present with 
a spread of classes from 1909 to 
1928. Among those present were: P. 
M. Williams, H. C. Porter, E. A. 
Siribiam, J. M. Sherman, F. B. Falk-

A new "brain toy” to test *the 
ingenuity of the younger generation 
has been invented by a engineer, 
David L. Mathias, 807 Mellon street, 
East Liberty, who received the 
patent on the toy electrical inven­
tion a short while ago. Mr. Mathias 
graduated from the Engineering 
College of Carnegie in 1914, and 
since then he has held a position 
in the experimental department of a 
large engineering corporation.
Known as a "toy set" at present, 
the invention is composed of a 
series of parts, with an electrical 
engine, self-operating, as the nu­
cleus around which mechanical toys 
are built. The engine is so devised 
that there is no danger from shock 
or burns by cross wires. Most 
electrical toys are more ¦' cumber­
some than this one because they 
operate with a motor instead of 
being self-operated.
JOHN ALMS
BARGER'S BELIEF IN THE OLD ADAGE that a good 
man can’t be kept down has not only won for him the school 
pole vault rccord but also the captaincy of the 1931 .track team. 
.With twelve of this year’s numeral men to bolster the ’31 varsity 
ranks, Barger will undoubtedly lead one of the best track teams 
Carnegie has ever turned out.

THE 1930 FOOTBALL SCHEDULE includes the names 
of three new rivals: Buffalo University,. Georgia Tcch, and 
Temple University. Buffalo University will give the griddcrs 
their first competitive work-out at Buffalo, September 27. The 
Georgians will appear at tlic Stadium two weeks later, and 
Temple will play host to our gridmcn at Philadelphia, Novem­
ber 22. The Buffalo contest, being the first on the schedule, 
will probably not prove as interesting as the following games, 
but both Georgia and Temple arc consistent producers of win­
ning combinations which will give the Scotchmen close raccs 
for the big ends of the scores.* * * * *
THE NOTRE DAME-P1TT FROLIC at the Stadium, 
October 25, will give Tartan rooters who arc unable to attend 
the Carnegic-Notre Dame game at South Bend the preceding 
Saturday an opportunity to sec Knutc Rockne’s Jrishers in 
action against the Panthers. And by comparing the scores 
made by the South Benders against Pitt and Tech, the outcome 
of the .city championship game might be predicted. YVe wonder 
which side of the field the Carncgians will sit on at the Pitt- 
Xotre Dame game.H< * * * *
THE BELLEFONTE-CARNEGIE PLEBE tilt at the 
Bowl, November 1, will also be worth seeing. Bellefonte has 
given the Tartan squad many of its luminaries in past years 
and no doubt several of the Academy boys who will be seen 
in the Bowl that day will later be seen on the campus—at least 
we hope so if they follow in the footsteps of old Bellefonte men 
such as Drcshar, Roscnzwcig, and Yerina.

Hardie teamed together for the last 
and deciding dual in the doubles. 
The results of the previous 
matches brought the score to a tie, 
and a victory in the final doubles 
match would have rendered the 
day’s decision. At one time the 
Genevans needed but one. point to 
call the day theirs, but Coach 
Hoover’s aspirants staged a suc­
cessful rally and stepped into the 
lead. A few more games and the 
Tartan team was on its way* home 
with another victory.
This season’s results show a 
good percentage with seven wins 
out of the nine matches. Besides 
providing an attractive schedule, 
Manager William Rjblcy Pfouts 
has been most helpful in providing 
unlimited volumes of Shakespeare 
for his team to read while on 
trips. These last efforts were 
greatly rewarded, for it was no­
ticed that the Scotch netmcn used 
a great deal of "English” on their 
balls this season.
And such -it player as Russ Lox- 
tcrman is responsible for consistent 
victories throughout the year. 
Graduation will cut a deep hole in 
the tennis possibilities for 1931, for 
the absence of Captan Kanback, 
Caffcc, Hardie, and Loxtcrman will 
be severely felt.

OU’VE noticed how expressive 
the pipe can be, what meaning 
it can put into the simplest gesture. 
The pipe even helps you say nothing 
at all—and that, O mortal, takes 
a man among men!
Men to their pipes and women 
to their lipsticks—but suppose you 
had no pipe and faced repression? 
Suppose you had no tobacco to put 
in your pipe! Empty pipes make 
empty gestures that have no mean« 
ing. Filled with good tobacco, your 
pipe becomes eloquent. Filled with 
Edgeworth, it is Olympian!
What, no Edgeworth? Lose not 
a moment—haste to the mails with 
the coupon. Let the machinery of 
government rush to you a frea 
packet of good old Edgeworth, 
delicious and friendly Edgeworth, 
full-flavored, slow-burning, cool.
The varsity track team ended 
their most successful season in a 
number of years when they handed 
Grov,e City'a 73-62 drubbing at the 
Bowl Friday. The result upset all , 
predictions and provided one of the j 
biggest surprises of the season in , 
tri-state collcgiatc circlcs.
The Plaid held a decided ad van- ( 
tagc over their rivals in the track' ( 
events, winning all but the quarter. . 
George Ncasc took two firsts on } 
the track while Merten matched . 
his feat in the field events. Ncasc 
won the 100 as well as taking the 
220 in the fast time of 22.8 seconds; , 
The 220 was the feature race of ( 
the afternoon with Kammcr and | 
Ptisch of Grove City fighting it . 
out with Ncasc right to the tape; | 
Brown and Shafer experienced no ( 
difficulties in annexing their spe­
cialties—the distance cvcnls. Phil | 
Magnusoti added another first, to 
the Skibo string by capturing his 
event, the half mile, in fast time. 
Ackenhcil and McFarlin shared ' 
honors in the hurdles, the former 
Winning the lows and the latter 
capturing the highs.
Captain Merten was the Plaid'-! 
tower of strength in field events. 
"Spike” captured the broad jump 
and the pole vault and tied for 
first >h the high jump to be the1 
leading scorer for the plaid. Grove 
City captured the remaining field 
events with PUsch carrying away 
the major share of the honors.1 
Tlje Crimson star look firsts in the 
discus and- shot, a second in the 
hundred, and thirds in the 220, 
broad jump, and hammer, to be the 
outstanding performer of the day. 
Ills feat of placing in six cvcnls 
in a single meet has not been 
equaled in the bowl since "Gib-. 
by" Welch of Pitt turned in six 
firsts during a Pitt-Carncgie dual 
meet.
Ray Barger, captain-elect of the 
Plaid, injured his leg and'was forc­
ed to retire from the pole vault 
competition, but he had already 
done well enough to tic for sccond 
place with Allison, of Grove City.

Carnegie’s well balanced racquet 
iiicn continued to show their su­
periority last week by defeating the 
Geneva geniuses, 4, to 3, and the 
Bethanitcs, 9 to 0. In the latter 
encounter the Plaid team took it 
easy and effected a genuine walk­
away. However, cach of the seven 
matches with Geneva proved to be 
a battle of wits and healthy 
strokes.
The delegates from Beaver Falls 
were treated to an exceptionally 
close battle which was marked by 
brilliant playing. Bob Caffee, as 
number one on the Plaid team, 
began the order of events with a 
decisive victory over his opponent 
Hccker. The first four games 
were divided evenly, but Bob’s su­
perior playing brought him the 
next five, and eventually the two 
sets. . Caffcc manouvcred the courts 
in top-notch style and gave many 
a thrill in returning the most dif­
ficult shots.. The defeated Heckcr, 
of Geneva, is a racquctcr of con­
siderable note, and our hats are/ off 
to Bob who .turned the trick.
Loxtcrman and Morris came 
through on the favorable side of 
their singles matches. Caffcc and
The second annual sports dinner 
given by the Athlctic Council of 
Carnegie Tech was held Thursday 
evening in the Commons. This ban­
quet is given cach year to the mem­
bers of the basketball, cross-coun­
try, swimming, rifle, track, and ten­
nis teams. > Mr, J. F. Laboon was 
the toastmaster.
Last year the Athlctic '¦Council 
dccidcd that annually a banquet 
should be held for those teams that 
did not get in the "Lime Light” as 
much as they deserved. It was also 
dccidcd that not only letter or num­
eral men should attend but also 
those fellows who were out to prac­
tice regularly but who were unable 
to make the team.
After the fellows had devoured 
all their chicken dinner and every­
thing that went with it, they loos­
ened their belts, pulled their chairs 
back and listened to the interesting 
s].ccches that were on. the pro­
gram. Ralph Davis, Sports Editor. 
oi the Press, devoted the greater 
part of his talk to those boys who 
had not made the teams, lie said, 
"The real idea for the athletics is 
not to win games; it is to get as 
many students as possible lo par­
ticipate in them. It is the boy who 
comes out for the so-called minor 
sport or the sport which goes al­
most unnoticed by the fans who 
plugs along year after year with 
perhaps no praise from the fans, 
but he gets his pleasure out of his 
ure which comes from the partici­
pation in athletics."
After Mr. Davis had talked, eaei*. 
of the coaches was asked lo give 
a short address. These men cn- 
Inrgcd upon the topic of Mr, Davis 
and gave very interesting speeches, 
The Coaches who talked were, 
Ralph Hogan, basketball; Guy Hal- 
forty, track; B. 1*. Hoover, tennis; 
an 1 Lieutenant Cothran, rifle.
In addition to these men, quite 
a few others were introduced. They 
included the sports writers of the 
newspapers members of the Ath­
letic Council, men interested In the 
athletics at Tech, the team captains 
and members of the teams. It was 
announced at this lime that Ray 
Barger, who holds the school rcc­
ord in the pole vault had been 
chosen as next year’s captain of the 
track team.
Announcement was made of all 
the men who had earned their vars­
ity letters this year in basketball, 
cross country, track, tennis, swim­
ming, and rifle. It was found that 
forty-four team members and twelve 
managers had been awarded letters. 
Also forty freshmen earned their 
numerals. The men receiving such 
awards are:

Grades—I noticcd an articlc 
last week’s issue of the Plaid about 
this question, and this sets me to 
•wonder what mine will be. Of course, 
you can’t expect an idle student to 
do much anyway, nor has this one 
; been guilty of'that offense. I don’t 
mind stating that if I receiv
(F-) grade, it will be about the
most I could, expect, because I ap­
peared to be the dullest one in every 
class I attended. It is a wonder
they didn’t turn me out.
1 haven’t received any inquiries to 
my proposition about YO YO, so here 
again is an indication that maybe my 
plan was not the world beater it was 
supposed to be. What 1 can’t see, 
however, is the large numbers 1 
notice who arc trying to play the 
game, when a little scientific manipu­
lation could eliminate all the failures. 
It may resolve itself into an alge­
braic equasion, or perhaps it may be 
possible to figure out on a slip stick 
the number of times the string twists 
in order to generate the force' to 
make the discs recoil back up the 
string. At all events, I will leave 
this question to some one who has 
a more analytical mind than I have.
Fooled again—Both the Book Re­
view and DIDJA NOTICE failed me, 
so next week I tfill write an articlc 
of my own so that I will have 
enough reading material to keep me 
busy. It may not be the fault of 
the columnists that these articles 
were not in, because the paper was 
full of good reading, this column ex­
cluded, or it may be the Editor is 
\ saving them for some future date,
1 pilfc at all events, they were not 
i1'*, and yours truly missed them.
I see somebody values the Supple­
mentary Term more than I do, judg- j 
w'g from the articlc signed H. E. M. 
He at least gives three good reasons 
"Wily you should matriculate for this 
ali enlightening coursc. I had reasons 
a\ my own about the coursc, but 
a'tcr ^reading Ii. E. M’s articlc, mine 
¦Vould not look good in print. I 
'ill l’ct him have the stage to him- 
Iclf.Of all the startling facts you could 
J think, of, those gleamed by the in­
quisitive reporter from his divers 
questions certainly* cap the climax. I 
would like to have been somewhere 
near when lie received the replies. 
I’ll bet you could write a book about 
it. I am going to be on the look-out 
for this fellow, and station myself at 
the "Cut,” then maybe I will be able 
to ask some questions too. Don’t i 
know just what they will be about, | 
but I expect to have ten ready at 
least for the next issue of the Plaid 
that is providing our editor will slip 
them through.
Yes, the Night Student Council 
, Dances were successes, if for no 
other reason than that I was there.
I didn't miss one of them and I am 
not going to miss any of them if 
I can help it. They certainly know 
how to get a big turnout. I don’i 
know what methods they use, but 
the results arc there so that in it­
self is sufficient evidence that they 
arc successes.

With this issue of the Plaid the 
final curtain is brought down on 
what has proven to be the most 
successful year in the history of 
Night School. It was a splendid 
spirit of co-operation which animated 
those night students of our student 
body who responded* at all times re­
gardless of the projcct and carried 
through to a successful finish. I wish 
to thank those who made it possible 
for the numerous successes which 
have rewarded us this year.
To the Social Committee headed 
by Mr. W. R. Hoddcr, and Mr. E. 
E. McDonald and assisted by Miss 
Emma M. Koch, Miss Emma A. 
Mauro, and Messrs. T. V. Klinefelter, 
J. T. Morphy, W. H. Lang, W. J. 
Fitzgerald, H. E. McGannon, M. B. 
Hudalc, T. J. Werner, W. Ii. Tan- 
nier, W. H. Gemmcll, A. liutnik, F. 
V. Golitz, F. C. Brunner, D. V. 
Huff and J. M. Judge, the bulk of 
the credit is due for their personal 
efforts and saci'ificcs extended by 
them for making this year the suc­
cess that it was. Of this group 1 
particularly wish to thank E. E. Mc­
Donald for his efforts in our behalf.
I am positive that without his un­
tiring assistance we would never 
have achieved the degree of success 
attained. Chairman Hoddcr and the 
other members of the Committee 
have certainly made this year a 
memorable year for us as can be i 
attested to by those who attended j 
the social affairs held.
To those students who contributed 
to the- splendid success of the Plaid 
1 wish to give my unstinted praise. 
Here, E. E. McDonald’s name again 
prominently appears, having set an 
enviable* record of articles written. 
Another member of the Plaid Staff 
who deserves praise is Mr. J. S. Gey­
ser whose interest in all affairs never 
seemed to lessen. He, too, always 
had items of interest to publish. We 
all, no doubt, read the Book Review 
for which we are indebted to E. 
DcLorcnzo, and you also remember 
Didja Noticc written by Miss E. B. 
Schaefer. These two students cer­
tainly deserve a vote of thanks. To 
the other contributors and members 
of the Plaid Staff 1 must add, that | 
without your assistance we would 
have been sorely handicapped.
To those other students whose un­
bounded enthusiasm carried the work 
forward to the great success I wish 
to give my unreserved thanks and ap­
preciation for their fncritorious serv­
ice.
To the Night Student Council I 
wish to express my sinccrc apprecia­
tion for the support given me
throughout the year. With your con­
sideration and assistance all projects 
benefited materially.
To the members of the Adminis­
trative Faculty I wish to extend my 
appreciation for their kind considera­
tion and the many favors shown 
the student body.
It would not be amiss to mention 
also Mr. John Manson, the head
watchman to whom the night student 
body is deeply indebted. To their feel 
ing of appreciation I wish to add my 
thanks for the many kind courtesies 
he extended to us throughout the 
year.
To those members of the day Stu­
dent Council with whom I came in 
contact relative Campus Activities, I 
am especially grateful. Their kind 
assistance, and friendly co-operation, 
coupled with a sinccrc desire to
maintain cordial relations’ on the
Campus between the two groups was 
of especial note to me, and it is 
my sincere hope that this spirit will 
continue.
Let me again thank every one who 
aided in any way in making this the 
successful year that it was, and^ it 
is with a feeling of deep satisfaction 
for this assistance given me that I 
say "adieu” until next year.
Most sincerely,
James H. Sansonetti,
President, Night Student Council.
OUR FAITHFUL FRIEND | The Carnegie Plaid
It is hardly possible for any per­
son to attend Carnegie Tech at' 
night without at some time or an­
other coming in contact with the 
head watchman of this institution. 
It is therefor not necessary to in­
troduce Mr. John Manson, whose 
picture wc have the pleasure of presenting herewith.
The position of head watchman 
deserves more than a casual re­
mark or two, and the person who 
fills this position likewise is en­
titled to consideration. Wc arc all 
aware of the fact that an individual 
can cither fill a position in-such a 
manner as to make himself and his 
position the cause of considerable 
dissatisfaction and displeasure to 
those whom he serves, or lie car 
fill the position with due considera­
tion and regard for others to make 
it a pleasure to have that individual 
serve you. That the lattci* is' 'the 
case with our head watchmen wc 
are most fortunate indeed.
There have been many occasions 
when Mr. Manson rendered service 
to night students of such a nature 
that did not fall strictly within his 
official duties, but by being mo­
tivated by a desire to serve lie went 
out of his way to render a kind­
ness here and there that has en­
deared him to: the .night student 
body. He has also been called 
upon to make decisions .which have 
ahvaj's shown him to be more than a watchman.
Mr. Manson has been in scrvicc 
i the campus for a period -of 
eighteen years and during this time 
has seen many groups of students 
come and go. He has also, witness­
ed a number of changcs which have 
taken placc such Ls—
The finishing of Machinery Iiall, 
the building of Administration Hall, 
the building of the new wing of the 
Margaret Morrison. Carnegie Col­
lege, the building of the north and 
south wings of Fine Arts Building, 
the building of the connccting link 
between Administration Hall and 
Industries Building, the building of 
the new Gymnasium,, the construc­
tion of the big tunnel through the 
Campus, and the transformation of 
the old Gymnasium into the present Carnegie Inn.
While serving on the, campus Mr. 
Manson has traveled a total mile­
age of 28;700 on and about the campus.
A record such as Mr. Manson 
holds is certainly one to be proud 
of and wc congratulate him upon 
his attainments. However, it would 
not be possible for such a rccord 
if he had, not been considerate of 
the other persons on and about the 
campus, and it is therefore, with 
deep regard and appreciation that 
the Plaid takes this occasion to 
acknowledge through its columns 
th- courtcsics extended to the night 
group by>our dear friend Mr. Man-
Thc Plaid brings to a close the 
sccoml year of its cxistancc, the 
second milestone as it were. "\\ • 
do not know how well wc havt 
served the night student group 
with our weekly publication, be­
cause you arc the judges, but wc 
do hope that if there were any 
shortcomings you will overlook them.
It may be possible that there 
were thing.» left undone which 
might have been done by us, and 
if pcrclmncc this is true, wc hope 
for your indulgence. You know, at 
least, wc made an effort to put 
our job over, and in aiming at our 
goal it was not always possible to 
see and do everything.
The night student’s lot is not the 
best and most desirable one to be 
cast into, and when you take into 
consideration the fact that in addi­
tion to following a coursc of study 
that some night students find time 
to carry on as thosti of the Plaid 
Staff have done a thought of appre­
ciation prompts me to mention the 
members of this staff.
First of all, just as regularly as 
the weeks .canic and went, wc had to make up our page and the copy 
had to be ready. Our readers 
know that there was not an issue 
of the Tartan published that did 
not have Some night school news. 
At times wc had to do some quick 
juggling in order to have the matcr- 
ial available and arc happy to write 
that somehow or other wc were 
always able to capture enough to 
fill our allotted spacc. Aiding lit 
our search for material were those 
faithful contributors and columnists 
who saw to it that wc sccurcd 
items of interest.
A special tribute is due that ltUc 
Night student for his faithful con­
tributions for as regularly #as clock­
work wc knew that we would hjvc 
an articlc for that column at least. 
Then wc had the Book Review and 
DIDJA NOTICE columns which 
were always a delight to read. 
There were also other contributors 
who were equally as welcome.
In connection with the ' I jau 
there was another side which had 
to be looked after and that was the 
circulation. Every night student 
who paid the Activities Fee is en­
titled tò rcccivc a'copy of the la - 
tan, and a sincere effort was made 
to have every night student reciive 
his copy. If there were any who 
,li,l not •' was not tlic fault of our 
staff. ' , . I ,Your editor, therefore, wishes to 
express his appreciation lo all those 
students who helped ,n any way 
to make the Plaid the success it 
was. More particularly docs he 
wish to thank Mr. J. S. Geyser, Mr.
D. E. South, Mr. K. J. 
and Mr. E. DcLorcn« of the Plaid 
Staff and E. J. McGannon, A. J. 
Clough, II. A. Poison, K. F. K°schy,
I G. Grant, W. E. Zemcla, E. IV 
Schaefer, D. V. Huff, and those 
other contributors who n.'adc, possible for him to compile data 
for the page. .He also wishes to express lus 
appreciation to Mr Thomas Lip- 
ncrt the Editor-in-Clucf of the lai 
tan ' of his wonderful co-operation 
and aid in making possible the 
regular Weekly issue of the paper,
Industrial Arts Dinner
The Industrial Arts Group of 
the College of Industries held its 
annual dinner on May 22nd at the 
Carnegie Inn Dining Room. A very 
representative group of this depart­
ment was present.
After a .delightful dinner, which 
was served to the queen’s taste, 
the guests of the evening treated 
all present to many very enlight­
ening impromptu talks touching 
ttfron the educational field. The 
speaker of the evening was Mr. 
H. E. Wittncr, Principal of the 
South Hills High School of the 
City of Pittsburgh. His talk 
touchcd upon the opportunities in 
Industrial Education, and what it 
means to the young student. Many 
very enlightening points about this 
phase of education were discusscd 
and disclosed the fact that there 
is a growing tendency to includc 
this type of education in the high 
schools. Wc were all sorry when 
Mr. Winner brought his talk to a 
close, for lie Certainly knows the 
importance of this type of work, 
and is in sympathy with its aims.
The other guests of the evening 
were Dr. G. D. Whitney and Dr. 
A. M. Goldbcrgcr of the University 
of Pittsburgh; Mr. F. M. Leavitt, 
Mr. F. W. Boland, Mr. J. M‘. 
Speer, Mr. J. R. Glenn, and Mr, J. 
T. Hawthorne, members of the 
educational staff of the Pittsburgh 
Public School system, and Director
A. C. Jewett, Dr. R. M. llirig, Prof. 
G. U. Clceton, Prof. H. M. Mc- 
Cully and Mr. E. H. Smith, ?mem­
bers of the Faculty of tho Carnegie 
Institute of Technology.

A Final Plea For The
Endowment Fund
The Night Student Council cam­
paign for soliciting contributions 
from the Night Students for the 
Carnegie 1946 Endowment Fund is 
about over. There is only the next 
week or so for those having locker 
keys to donate. During the past week 
cash contributions .from students not 
having locker keys have been coming 
iii and will be turned into the fund.
All cash contributions should be 
mailed to the Night Student Council 
of Carnegie Tcch and accompanied 
by the contributor's name. All con­
tributions in this campaign will be 
acknowledge in the Plaid when final tabulations arc made.

for without the team work which 
existed, the Plaid could not have 
functioned as successfully as it did. 
There were other members of the 
Tartan staff, while unknown to your 
editor, still their help was an aid, 
and it is to acknowledge this as­
sistance that mention is made here­with.
There is a feeling of regret creep­
ing in since this is the final issue 
of the year, as it was a pleasure 
for the Plftid to serve you, never­
theless, all things have to end, and 
likewise the Plaid terminates its 
sccond baby year hoping that you 
have derived some little enjoyment 
from our sinccrc effort to put over a student projcct.

This is a unique group on the 
campus as its members arc enrolled 
in both the day and night school 
classes, and all the subjects taught- 
arc ci‘cdited towards a degree in 
Industrial Educatioil.
The dinner was brought to a 
close with all expressing the wish 
that another dinner be held in 
the near future.
An Afterthought
With the excruciating final ex­
aminations now a thing of the past, 
the thought that comes to all of us 
is whether wc passed or not. Of 
coursc a general idea of your marks 
can be determined by your own 
analysis of the work for the semester 
and the manner in which you handled 
the final examination. But of what 
value arc mere marks? Do they 
alone determine anything? We shall sec.
Here at Carnegie wc have a won­
derful technical school, in fact one 
of the few in the country that give 
the same degree courses to the night 
students that the day students rcccivc 
with the same credits. Of coursc it 
takes twice as long and sometimes 
longer to complete a coursc at night 
school but the average night student, 
being used to hard work and mak­
ing sacrifices, does not mind the 
grind when lie has a definite objective 
‘to work to. By this is meant a stu­
dent who is working for a certificate 
a diploma. A student in this 
group is very careful to work his 
hardest on every subject, whether 
he thinks the subjcct will be of 
value to him or not, for the highest 
marks lie can earn. If the student 
receives a C plus and thinks his 
mark should be B, he does not fail
to take the matter up with the in­
structor, so sensitive is the student 
that the slightest deviation from his 
opinion of his own value is quite 
painful. This is always true when 
the change is for the worse from 
the student's viewpoint.
So it is with the student who 
craves the coveted sheepskin. A 
diploma is proof of knowledge and 
something of which he can be just­ly proud.
On the other hand there arc the 
students taking elective subjects and

A College Education
• ' In- the June issue of the American magazine is an article 
•written by a graduating-Senior front Bowdoin College. It is 
entitled “Wher6 do I go from here” and in it the author laments 
the fact'that a liberal-arts ¿ducation does not develop a man for 
any particular type of work. “What have I to offer my em­
ployer,” he says. “The answer is easy. Nothing. On the other 
hand a graduate of a technical..school can go to' a prospective 
employer and say he is trained .in " a' particular^ type of • work. 
If the employer needs such-a man he‘receives the job.-M- 
"' ‘ The author of the above mehtioned article is-right in some 
respects and wrong in'others.' A technical man' has the advan­
tage • in, securing a position immediately upon graduation, but 
¦whether he will hold that advantage depends, not so much upon 
his education, as upon himself. It is the opinion of many busi­
ness, men that education really begins upon graduation from 
college. What a man learns in' college, be it liberal arts or 
technical work, may or may not be of use to him in the- busi 
ness world. If he has received nothing from college except 
a knowledge of Latin and Greek, formulas ahd integrals, he has 
done’himself an injustice.
The most important part ofr a college education i-s social 
development. A knowledge 'of textbooks is necessary, but the 
study of human nature is quite esstiritial. Meeting people, mak­
ing contacts with all types of individuals, being able to humor 
some and tolerate others—that is an education.
Think It Over
Club-rooms
With the closing of the school term :there are.several im 
pro^ements necessary to the campus which should immediately 
suggest themselves to 'the Administration. The-most apparent 
of these.7 is the necessity for -more and better equipped club 
rooms. The present “holes” which someone laughingly termed 
club-rooms are decidedly inadequate for a school the size of 
Carnegie. Besides being small and lacking in number they are 
poorly equipped and invariably filthy.
It is-true, no doubt, that the students do not exercise the 
proper cai*e when they are Occupying these rooms',-but then they 
, can hardly be blamed as their argument—-“You can’t make some­
thing out of nothing’—is -quite correct, if, however, well 
furnished and attractive club-rooms were provided there would 
riot be the present trouble in keeping'them in the proper condi­
tion. The appearance of the “Y” club room, which the school 
does not maintain, is a proof of this argument.
The question of the'necessary funds, while always to be 
Considered should not be' an excuse-for refusing- to make the 
Club-rooms an attractive place to gather and to study. Money 
is'obtained for other things; surely it could be raised for this 
purpose. .
Dream of Youth
The following, article was written .by Miss';Zona.; .Gale and is re­
printed from “The Al-Cori,” ; which ^ is the publication- of Alpha Chi 
Alpha, honorary journalistic, society for. women.- Miss Gale is an honor­
ary member of this organization. - ...
Recently I read in a college paper'tlie following, in-an in­
terpretation of the attitude of the youth-of today:
“We have come to accept nothing as sacred. We' feeL that 
all the old values must be re-valued. ... . We are making ours 
the generation of the experimental life.- ‘Prove all things and 
hold fast to that which is good’ might well be our slogan.'
This seems to sum up-the various confessions Which are 
made' in print as expressive of the attitude' ôf yOiithi I note 
that slogan which is to prove all. things and hold fa’st to that 
which is good. And I wonder .if that slogan is consistent with 
the dictum: “Nothing is-sacred,” and whether that too .has been 
proved.
It. is not however that I’question the logic of this attitude 
nor the ethics.’ But I do question whether this is the scientific 
spirit. For science, like art, is selective. It does not affirm : 
"Nothing is sacred.” It admits certain principles—those, say, of 
gravitation and combustion. It does not cry: “Everything is
worth trying.” To determine how many angels can dance on 
the point of a needle isTio'longer worth a Scientist’s while—and 
there are other occupations discarded as not les§, futile.
This excluding negation of the sacred and this indiscriminate 
affirmation of the worth of all experience seem to me unscien­
tific, because they are unselective.
I am assuming that this confessed attitude of a negation of 
the past is sufficiently inconsistent to admit the value of scien­
tific experiment. But science is controlling nature. That is, 
science is slowly beating back nature’s- control over man and 
developing man’s control, over. .na_tur.c.. » Imagine, instead, science 
saying: “I shall co-operate in every possible experience—disease, 
poverty, insanity. For these belong tp life.- T affirm them. I 
shall participate in them.”
Both internal and external nature—to use an eastern denom­
ination of. the .one nature—shall control man or he shall control 
it. For all youth’s dream of freedom, this article on youth’s 
attitude toward life seems to me to express youth’s willingness 
that nature shall enslave- if-

The finale of the dansants, called 
tea dances of the "hoili poili,” that 
have been thrown by C. Einar 
Schatvet, M. Elizabeth McNary, 
and their cohorts during the past 
year, was attended Thursday after­
noon by the Commercials and all 
others who didn’t have anything 
else to do. The ringleader of the 
Commercials, one Frank Foote, 
aforementioned, created quite a stir 
on his arrival, the orchestra leader, 
Jerry McGeorge, going so far as 
to announce, after drum-pounding 
and fan-fare, that “The girls can 
be happy now—Frank Foote’s 
here.” The affair was graced by 
the presence of King Lippert, in 
green “Sussies,” Jimmy Leonard, 
Jimmy Walker’s only rival, Ed­
ward Cadwallader Eastabrooke, 
who lays claim to the longest name 
in' the school, the Margies of Mt. 
Lebanon, who have recently picked 
a Lemon, one William E., to in­
crease their twosome to a three­
some, " James “Red” Fergus, the 
Lothario of the tennis courts, and 
Hazel Gough, who appeared in the 
local Scripps-Howard last week in 
a pirate costume, the picture hav­ing been taken at' the ’ornery Pi­
rate Ball. ' The publicity commit­
tee of the class' of ’33, namely, 
Fran Coyle, Marion McNary, Kay 
Wholey and Ann . Warden, added 
their own little touch to the party. 
The Mechanical delegation, led by 
Al Miller and Tom Conneliy, were 
present for the first time this year, 
having been thrown out of E."E. 
lab when “Dusty” Rhoads tried to 
weld three leads together at 110 
volts. Tom Connelly recently has 
been christened the “Helen Kane of Phi Kappa.”

ship has been dccidcd. Professors

ment banquet, yo-yoing solemnly 
to the tunes of Bob Galbrcath and

nesday, contested to the last ex­
hausted “yo,” Dcnnj' Dennison 
emerging the victor. Doe Work 
accused the victor of prcvibu.s

ment boasts the snappiest faculty 
in school, with Denny’s red hat, 
Doc Work’s false whiskers, “D.

Cackle, Cackle.
Seniors—looking for jobs.
Juniors—hunting summer work.
Sophomores, freshmen — on the 
labor market.
Students from Carnegie Tcch, 
hundreds more from Pitt, Du- 
qucsne, frqm a thousand other 
cdHcgcs, needing' money, are- short­
ly to come in contact with the ac­
tual world.
What- will, they find?
Grown men out of work. Men 
with families. Honest men, ca­
pable men, industrious men. Out 
of work. Why?
No jobs.
Production has lessened, wages 
are cut, jobs are fewer.
April, 1929, to April 1930: jobs 
in autos slumped 19.5 per cent, 
metal products, 16% per cent, lum­
ber, 13 per cent, textiles, 9 'per 
cent. These - figures from Labor 
Bureau, Inc.
Stock market panic and indus­
trial depression, a combination to 
cause a great shock to the indus­
trial system—the worst panic since 1921-22.
Boys will notice the effect when 
they- peddle their magazines from 
door to door. Department stores 
need fewer and fewer clerks. In­
dustries arc working part-time, 
with fewer hands.
Larger bread-lines; more men at 
the factory gates, waiting, waiting 
for work of any sort.
Contrast: Millions of dollars
spent for luxuries; enormous divi­
dends paid by corporations.
What is the answer to it all?
The cause is underconsumption, 
resulting from low wages, fewer 
jobs.
The remedy is not too far afield 
—the* immediate remedy; Wages 
must be raised, in order to increase 
the national buying power, to 
strengthen the market. Hours 
must' be shortened. As each im­
provement is introduced into in­
dustry, shorter hours would insure 
the- same number of jobs- as bc- 
'forc. .
Ultimately the only solution is 
the socialization of industry, the 
prevention of the accumulation of 
all huge private fortunes, the just 
return to the worker of what he 
has produced. The means of pro­
duction, the mines, the factories, 
the railroads, all these must be 
exploited for the benefit of the 
masses of the people, just as arc 
now the water systems and the 
postal service.
Students in industry, then, look 
about! Decide for yourselves just 
how bad the situation- is, look for 
causes, reason out results.
But think!

Evidence to show that Mr. Wha­
len’s famous red documents were 
manufactured in a small printshop 
on East Tenth street, New York 
City, was offered to the House of 
Representatives on May 12 by Rep­
resentative La Guardia. Mr. Wha­
len, testifying a few days previous­
ly before the House Committee on 
Immigration and Naturalization 
had refused to divulge the - source 
of his documents oh the ground 
that to do so might interfere with 
an investigation into Communist 
activities now being conducted in 
New York City.
It is difficult to be patient with 
this sort of official sidestepping. 
But if wc arc to have investiga­
tions t>f Communist activities, as 
perhaps we should have in. order 
to permit Mr. Whalen 'to sleep .at 
night, thorough, -unbiased, »and re>- 
ccptive of testimony from all sides. 
And let us not forget that an in­
vestigation docs not offer an ex 
cuse for indiscriminate red hunt 
or a frcsli scries of, Lusk laws. 
Wc have 'had enough of that sort 
of hysteria.
Let us not forget, also, that as 
a specific case of what the Com­
munists would rightly call class 
justice, Robert Minor, William Z-. 
Foster, Israel Amter, and Harry 
Raymond are in jail in New York, 
convicted of a misdemeanor, that 
they were sentenced to from six 
months to three years in prison, 
and that they have been denied 
bail pending appeal of their case. 
These, men clearly suffer not for 
their offense, which was slight, but 
for their opinions. Whatever their 
opinions, they are entitled to their 
rights and privileges under the law.

BUDDY ROGERS DOESN'T FEEL LIKE AN ACTOR
Charlcson- Gray asked Buddy Rogers, .what: he thought about it all, and. what Buddy answered ap­pears as follows:'•‘Say! I can’t believe it! It's a dream. I’m going to wake upland find myself a little country boy back in Kansas. Look! Twenty- three 'thousand fan letters,, and Valentino got only sixteen thou­sand his biggest month! Letters from all over the world. I. look 
at them and they’re addressed to me, but I can’t believe that they're really for me; But,” lie added naively, “they arc.
“Sometimes people tell me that I. should ljc a little more reserved, now that I’m a star. But, gee! I couldn’t be that way. 1 guess I got roped in on hundreds of 
things I might avoid, but I’ve been friendly with everyone always. Why should I stop now? I go to the Phi- Psi,- dances over at -U. - S. C., and I’m around at the house a lot for lunch. - I like college peo­
ple.; they ¿peak my language and at ..the same, time they..keep me from gceing loo ‘ much of. Holly­wood. , You knoyf, kee.p me s bal­anced.
“-l'hcy;r¿ my "people! Gee, when 
I went 'back’‘to Lawrence and tlic boys' in th'c hóu¿c' ga'vé' hie a lit­tle ban'quct,- I- think it was the proudest •day- of my- life. - The fam­ily of one - of- the -boys, from ' the chapter, the fclloW- with whom I 
went .to, Europe on the mule boat, 
has .a bungalow out here and • I've lived with them ever since I’ve 
been in Hollywood. They’ve been great to me and to' another boy from home, a Beta. When 'I’m with them I don’t feel like an actor at all, and all of this that's happened to me in the past few months just slips out of my mind. Not that 1 do anything but love it, but honestly, in spite of all this marvelous luck I’ve had, the days I .spent in the university were the happiest of my life.
“Picture girls are all right,” he acknowledges. “You know that... but you know what T mean. The 
university girl has something they can't touch. They’r'e the : class of he land.”
mentally by their efforts they arc 
satisfied regardless of whether ‘ their 
marks arc B’s or E’s. To them the 
marks mean nothing as long as they 
have gained a knowledge of some­
thing to make them more valuable 
to their employer in their everyday 
work.
The night students arc not alone in 
this'respect. A couple ot" yeari ago 
a day student .enrolled in a certain 
coursc and covered in one semester 
the subject lie was after and that 
would have taken him two years 
otherwise. This man was after 
knowledge of operation atid main- 
tainahce of a certain machine. After 
acquiring this knowledge it was only 
by the requests' of his fellow stu­
dents that he stayed for the ex­
aminations and did not leave school 
a week earlier.
And so it goes year after year. 
The students working for diplomas 
in various courses keep plugging for 
more and higher marks while the 
others arc content to get1 their knowl­
edge on a certain subject and let 
it go at that. The supplementary 
courses now going on have many stu­
dents of the former class who arc 
trying to erase a low mark and earn 
more credits. Regardless of their pur­
pose we admire all students who arc 
willing to make the sacrifices that 
arc necessary if tliey choose to go 
to school at night to broaden their 
knowledge of the work they plan to 
follow. As you think over the year 
just guagc your success by what you 
really learned arid wiU remembcr and 
not by the marks that you received 
on a test that you pointed for and 
doubtless have forgotten about even
