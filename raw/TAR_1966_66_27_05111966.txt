Athletic Board Makes 
IM, Varsity Policies
The President’s Athletic Board, Dr. Stever’s pri­
mary advisory group on athletics, made a number of 
decisions at its most recent meeting last Tuesday 
on matters of business which have come before the 
board during this academic year.___________________
A request from the Military De-
New Constitution Provides 
Senate Elections Next Week
Under the new Student Congress Constitution, which easily passed an all­
school referendum last week, elections for Congress President, Vice-Presi- 
dent, and representatives will be held next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Students can meet President
partment that the Rifle Team be 
given full varsity status and pla­
ced under the Athletic Department 
was approved as the first item of 
business. The rifle team has been 
financed during the past several 
years by the Student Government 
and scheduling, coaching, etc, have 
been handled by the Military De­
partment. The board's decision 
makes the finances of the team 
part of the Athletic Department 
budget and brings scheduling mat­
ters under the Athletic Depart­
ment in a manner consistent with 
the status of other varsity sports.
A request by the Executive Coun­
cil of the Student Government that 
the government be allowed to ap­
point the student representatives 
to the Athletic Board was consid­
ered next. Currently, the bylaws of 
the board as chartered by the trus­
tees specify that students shall be 
represented by the chairman of the 
Student Congress, the editor of 
the Tartan, and the president of 
the Varsity C Club. TTie board 
requested a formal recommenda­
tion concerning this matter from 
the Student Government on which to 
act, and possibly to begin pro­
ceedings for an amendment to the 
board's bylaws which will prove 
satisfactory to the government, the 
board, and the trustees.
George K, Brown, dean of the 
Division of Student Affairs, then 
reported to the board on the sta­
tus of one of the policy recommen­
dations approved by the board in

Strick TakesOverDeanship 
At Millersville Stale College
Dale E. Strick, Coordinator of Student Activities, 
is resigning to take the job of Dean of Academic Af­
fairs at Millersville State College, Millersville, 
Pennsylvania.
The announcement of Dr.
Strick’s appointment by Millers­
ville president Robert A. Christie 
came less than two weeks after the 
news of the departure of H, Rus­
sell Bintzer, Vice - President for 
Development, for a job as head of 
development at California Insti- 
ture of Technology.
Strick will officially assume his 
new position August 1. Yesterday 
he met members of the Millers­
ville Academic Council at a din­
ner at president Christie’s home.
He was chosen for the job by a 
five-man selection committee 
which “considered his qualifica­
tions . . . to be outstanding.”
Many Roles
Since joining the Carnegie Tech 
faculty as a History instructor in 
1948, Strick has had a varied ca­
reer as teacher and administrator.
He has served as Head of Hous­
ing, Financial Aid Chairman, and 
Director of the Campus Activi­
ties Center (Skibo) as well as 
Coordinator of Student Activi­
ties.
He assisted in setting up and
Computers Meet Head-on 
In Programmed Chess
The longest chess game ever to be played between 
two computers will soon decide whether Carnegie 
Tech or Stanford University has the world’s cham­
pion chess program.
Professor John McCarthy, Head 
of Computer Science at Stanford, 
formerly a prof at MIT, claim­
ed to have the best program, and 
was challenged by Joseph Ruben- 
feld, Harvey Shapiro and Robert 
Walker, whose program was 
written at Carnegie Tech. Walker 
is ranked by a national chess 
scoring system as second in 
Pittsburgh.
Two games were started in Sep­
tember, each team obtaining mov­
es from their computer and send­
ing them by mail. TTius only eight­
een moves had been played until 
last Sunday, when the two teams 
decided to communicate by tele­
type. As of the time of this writ­
ing, the Carnegie Tech program 
is slightly ahead in one game and 
slightly behind In the other, but 
no conclusion has yet been reach­
ed.
Walker feels that Carnegie 
Tech's program is probably “about 
as good” as any other, and does not 
expect either game to end in a rout.
The play, he says, is reasonable, 
but not particularly competent in 
terms of tournament competition.
Tech Supports 
Grad Appeals
Carnegie Tech recommends that 
graduate students consider taking 
the SSCQT especially if they feel 
that their local board will insist 
upon a literal interpretation of 
Selective Service regulations.
However, if a graduate student 
does not take the test and at a 
later date has difficulty with the 
local board, he should contact the 
Dean o| Men’s office immediately. 
It is especially necessary that he 
initiate appeal procedures within 
the specific time limits if the 
board attempts induction.
According to school officials: 
“Carnegie Tech will support such 
appeals vigorously and will pro­
vide every resource at its com­
mand --both counsel and documen­
tation — to assure that the policy 
designed to provide for the de­
ferment of graduate students is 
not abrogated.”
Dale E. Strick
operating the new class registra­
tion and grading system using 
computers, and assisted the Ad­
missions Office with interview­
ing. Strick also was on planning 
committees for the fraternity hou­
sing complex, Skibo, and the new 
men’s dormitories.
His associates on the faculty 
have elected him Secretary of 
the General Faculty, faculty mem­
ber of the President’s Athletic 
Board, and President of the Fa­
culty Club,
While carrying on these activi­
ties Strick has continued to teach 
at least one course per year. He 
has taught classes in European, 
English, and American History, 
Historiography, and Economics, 
and has participated in course 
planning in these fields and for the 
graduate program.
Work to be Published
A manuscript based on his doc­
toral dissertation at the Univer­
sity of California, “Froudeandthe 
Oxford School: English Historio­
graphy, 1859 - 1890”, will be pub­

Strick received his B.A. from 
Reed College in Oregon, where he 
was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, 
and received his M.A. from the 
University of Oregon.
He is a member of Phi Kappa 
Phi, Omicron Delta Kappa, Alpha

Vos Stages Brecht Challenge 
For Judgement of Audience
by Ellen Levine
“The Measures Taken,by Bethold Brecht, has ne­
ver been performed, according to Erik Vos, the direc­
tor of this mainstage production, because it is not flat­
tering to Communists and yet Americans view it as 
too Communistic. ___________________
Mr. Vos singled out this par­
ticular play in order to present 
a provocative challenge to his 
audience. He believes that the thea­
ter's function is not primarily one 
of enjoyment, but rather one of 
instruction. The theater shows its 
audience a new dimension of 
reality; the real situation on the 
stage represents something more 
because it is only an imitation of 
reality. It is more real to see a 
drunken man than to see an ac­
tor portraying one; yet, the actor 
stands for something deeper and 
projects himself farther, thus 
making a kind of statement about 
what he is doing.
Brecht Suits VosBrecht’s didactic style is well 
suited to Mr. Vos’ ideas. The 
playwright wanted to inform the 
German people of the truth; op­
posed to wrong sentiment and rea­
listic theater, Brecht begins with 
reality, and, by trying to show how 
to fight ignorance, he depicts his 
truth. The audience is not to be­
come involved in the play, but ra­
ther are to judge what they have 
seen. To facilitate this, Mr. Vos 
will have the action take place in 
a boxing ring. This keeps the au­
dience separate and forces them 
into their own decision about 
what is right and wrong.
Hiere is no single truth in the 
play. Each man constantly strug­
gles to And a balance between his 
beliefs and those of others, and it 
ultimately becomes impossible to 
be honest because of the need to 
compromise.
It is always the small man who 
is in doubt, never the Communist 
Party (or, in the larger sense, 
the conforming group), TTie small 
man cannot afford to save him­
self. Yet Brecht points out that 
everyone has something of the 
small man in him, for when an in­
dividual dies onstage, the audience 
feels killed too, because of their 
identification with the small man. 
Christian symbols abound in the 
play because, according to Vos, 
our civilization is so impregnated 
with them that they are necessary

Special Concert
Dr. William Steinberg and the 
Pittsburgh Symphony have agreed 
to offer a special concert at 3:10 
May 15 in Carnegie Music Hall, 
Oakland, to make up for the snow- 
ed-out January 23 program.
Tickets for unreserved seats 
will be available from the Sym­
phony office, 1305 Rockwell - Stan­
dard Building, Fifth at Wood, or 
students may send a stamped, 
self-addressed envelope.
The program will include Mo­
zart’s Overture to “Marriage of 
Figaro”, Serenade K.525 “Eine 
Kleine Nachtmusik,” Richard 
Strauss’s "Don Juan”, and Schu­
bert’s Symphony No. 9.
to facilitate understanding of the 
Play.
Medical Aspiration
Erik Vos was on his way to be­
coming a doctor when he realized 
that the theatre needed competent 
people more than did the medical 
profession. He then studied drama 
and mime in France and return­
ed to his native Holland, where 
he started his own company of four 
players. His restless interest in 
problems of the theatre brought 
him to America where he worked 
at Stanford University, perfor­
ming “Prometheus.” Mr. Vos 
prefers to produce only a few 
plays each year in order to have 
time to think about them and pre­
sent them at their best. He wants 
to please himself more than his 
audience; he feels that New York 
theater is mediocre simply be­
cause it attempts to please too 
many people.
During his rehearsals of “The 
Measures Taken,” Vos has assign­
ed no parts; everyone learns all 
the parts and thus can understand 
the play as a whole. The actors 
can then work together, better 
assimilating the emotions and in­
teractions of the characters.

A Choice Not An Echo
With the ratification of the new constitution of Stu­
dent Government, which was recently passed after 
months of controversy and debate, elections for go­
vernment officers have finally begun. Statements by 
the three presidential candidates, Robert Bogart, 
Bruce Handley, and Joseph Orens, appear opposite 
this page to give the students, who must decide between 
them, some means with which to judge their qualifica­
tions.
In anticipation of reading these statements, one would 
hope to learn precisely what accomplishments in be­
half of the student body each of the candidates for- 
sees, and what potential each possesses for achieving 
their goals. The Tartan, however, after scrutiny of 
these statements, must ask whether any of the 
candidates has indeed answered these basic ques­
tions, and therefore, whether any has a really clear 
conception of the responsibilities and potentialities as­
sociated with the office they seek.
To be sure, all the candidates recognize the failures 
and shortcomings which the Student Government has 
experienced in the past. This is important, but is 
certainly no great accomplishment. In light of these 
deficiencies, then, what has each candidate to say?Although Bogart seems to recognize the need for dy­
namic action, his primary point is that the major 
problems with government will be lessened “by de­
veloping a genuine interest and awareness in the stu­
dent body for its government.” This seems to be plac­
ing the proverbial cart before the horse: the only way 
for the government to gain the interest of the students 
is to prove that the government can act and can produce 
concrete results. Interest will be generated with re­
sults, not the reverse.Furthermore, Bogart seems to consider the promul­
gation of increased school spirit as a primary 
goal of the government. Bogart seems very unrealis­
tic here, for students are less concerned about the 
volume of noise they can create in the stadium 
than with the achievement of concrete goals through 
forceful programs, such as the extension of library hours which was recently achieved.
The amelioration of Skibo as a student union and 
the improvement of the student court system are two 
other goals which Bogart projects; his statements 
about Skibo, however, serve only to reveal his ignor­
ance of the true nature of that situation, and his two- 
sentence comment on the courts fails to offer any 
concrete suggestions for its improvement.
Handley seems to be somewhat less unrealistic; 
he states pointedly that “school spirit is not an ultimate 
goal,” and forsees that “one unfortunate result could 
be a government which forces school spirit and its ac­
tivities on students.” On the contrary, he asserts 
that the government must “present realistic solutions 
to problems,” and “would offer the undergraduate 
body a choice between ‘flag-waving’ and realism in 
Student Government.”
Unfortunately, Handley fails to specify just what 
are the problems which he would endeavor to solve 
realistically; he fails to indicate what procedures 
and programs he would implement to accomplish those 
realistic solutions; finally, he fails to explain just what 
is the dividing line between “flag-waving” and realism.
Orens does seem to see a few definite goals: great­
er use of committees, improved communications, ful­
fillment of administrative promises. But Orens, too, 
does not specify how he would attempt to achieve his 
goals. Moreover, he seems to consider that the mere 
existence of a new constitution will go a long way tow­
ard solving the problems of government and accom­
plishing its objectives. Great as is the potential of the 
new constitution for enabling the government to revi­
talize itself, it will prove only as good as the people 
who serve within and help to define the organizational 
matrix for which the document provides.
All the candidates, furthermore, offer only the 
briefest of accounts, if any at all, of their personal 
qualifications for office.
The three contenders have made only vague state­
ments of their goals for government, they have cited 
only a minimal number of programs which they would 
undertake, which lacked any indication of concrete 
structure, and they have specified the nature of the 
few new procedures they would introduce only in the barest outline form.
In light of these criticisms, the question raised 
above, asking whether the candidates possess a clear 
conception of the nature of the office they seek, seems 
to be vindicated and this certainly does not present
Troika
By John Day

Da vici Henderson
Last week Dr. Herbert Apthet- 
ker, the leading, Marxist theore­
tician of the C.P.U.S.A., fresh from 
his trip to Hanoi with Prof. Staugh- 
ton Lynd of Yale and the book 
which he has written on it, “Mis­
sion to Hanoi” spoke on the Viet­
nam subject and answered ques­
tions afterwards. Aware of his re­
cent trip, but more acquainted with 
his daughter Bettina’s exploits at 
Berkeley in the F.S.M. we were 
expecting something more on the 
flamboyant side. He is not an im­
posing figure, being somewhat un­
der medium height with a grey­
haired crewcut, wearing what 
seemed at first glance ironically 
to be a reasonable facsimile of 
Goldwater glasses.
Speaking in generally hushed 
tones, he treated the Vietnam ques­
tion in what appears more and 
more to be the classic procedure. 
He covered basically four points. 
The first, of course, the Domino 
Theory, was brought up and discar­
ded. Considering LBJ in this re­
gard he said, “LBJ has flung 
them (the dominos) on the floor”. 
The second consideration was Chi­
na and China in relation to Korea. 
With the comparison of Quemoi, 
Matsu, and the Yalu river to Nan­
tucket, the Florida Keys, and the 
St. Lawrence River and how he 
would feel in the same circum­
stances he passed to the third 
point, appeasement and Munich. 
On this Dr, Apthetker talked about 
indigenous revolutionary move­
ments and that yesterday’s appea- 
sers are really today’s warm­
ongers. His last attack was on the 
negotiate - from - strength posi­
tion with a prediction of 250 mil­
lion Chinese casualties to 350 
thousand of our own.
Thus, by playing on the Bomb 
neurosis that inflicts our nation, 
plus a casual reference to the 
great bogeyman, the late Senator 
McCarthy, he generally won the 
audience. The Hearst Press and 
the International Money Conspi­
racy got their licks along with 
Mr. Nixon who was cited for twen­
ty years of treason. He reached 
a point of high drama when speak­
ing of his position he said, “If 
this be treason, let my name be 
placed high on the list of trait­
ors.”
At one point during some mild 
heckling Dr. Apthetker got his 
back up and announced that he was 
no patsy. In this we definitely con­
cur. He is the best speaker we have 
heard on the subject. In very pre­
cise terms he came quickly to 
his point. He documented his 
talk at frequent and meaningful 
intervals. He remained composed 
and handled his hecklers with ease.
During the question period did he 
show a more interesting side. He 
spoke of Communism, which while 
not identical, was definitely relat­
ed to humanism, liberalism, and 
democracy and was the revolu­
tionary breakthrough in the his­
tory of human equality. Concern­
ing the Berlin Wall, he said it was 
merely a barricade to stop black 
marketeering and ease East Ger­
many’s balance of payments defi­
cits. He said its resulting difficul­
ties of flight were only secondary. 
And besides, the people who fled 
from east to west were mostly 
the Fascists and Prussian Junk­
ers who preferred the more fas­
cist government of West Germa­
ny to the socialist of East Ger­
many.
No, Dr. Apthetker is no patsy; 
he is an articulate spokesman of 
Communism, He spoke most con­
vincingly on the subject of Viet­
nam as reflected by the response 
from the audience. But we must 
treat a man who speaks in this 
way concerning the Berlin Wall 
and Mr. Nixon much in the same 
way as Mr. Robert Welch of the 
John Birch Society and his ram­
blings about General Eisenhow­
er. Dr. Apthetker cannot be dis­
carded as lightly as one would Mr. 
Welch for he represents an ap­
paratus that has shown itself most 
effective in the eradication of hu­
man freedom.
a very bright picture for the future of the Student 
Government.
The first president of the new Student Government 
will be selected from these three candidates, and it 
is to be hoped that he will be able to give greater defi­
nition and direction to his plans and achieve success 
for Student Government.

Midnight Early 
At Snack Bar
Editor, the Tartan:
Am I correct in assuming the 
Skibo Snack Bar is open for ser­
vice until 12 p.m. on Monday 
evenings? My experience th^ 
evening prompted me to write 
to the Tartan as I would not know 
to whom I should direct the com­
plaint.
At 11:55 p.m. I asked one of the 
waitresses for an ice cream cone 
and she refused service — the 
other waitress was busy making 
sandwiches which the first had 
previously refused to make. When 
I tried to explain that she ws^ 
being paid to serve patrons of Ski­
bo Snack Bar until 12 p.m. she be­
came extremely bitter and indig­
nant as she swore at me. It tak­
es them 15 seconds to make a 
lousy ice cream cone, yet I was 
refused service owing to the “fact” 
that I had “no business” coming 
in so late. It seems that her idea 
was to clean up and leave by twelve, 
and stop serving an amount of tin^ 
before that which will enable her 
to do so. Since the Snack Bar is 
open until 12 I feel I should be 
served up to that time and not be 
required toJeave the library ear­
ly just to please the help at Ski­
bo. TTiey are being paid for a job 
which I expect them to fulfill. 
By the way, I finally did get my 
cone — from the other waitress 
after she finished the sandwichef ^
Thank you for letting me express 
my feelings on this matter.

Candidates Present Their Platforms
Bogart Asks For 
Groups To Help
In the past the students and 
their government have rarely if 
ever been satisfied with each other. 
This can only be remedied by de­
veloping a genuine interest and 
awareness in the student body 
for its government. Once this is 
on the way towards being accom­
plished, all other problems will be 
greatly lessened. This can be done 
only if the student body itself seeks 
an active part in student govern­
ment and if student government ap­
pears interesting and worthwhile 
enough to the student body. TTie 
previous student government has 
been unable to achieve this basic 
step, but it has provided a me­
thod by which the next admini­
stration can.
President's Position
The position of president of the 
Student Body is a new one to the 
Tech campus. This office shall be­
come a sort of central position, 
communicating both with the ad­
ministration and the student body, 
in an effort to lessen the rather 
large chasm that has developed 
in recent years. The president 
must be the spokesman of the 
student body to the administra­
tion. He must try to achieve a 
balance between control and sup­
port that will be agreeable to both 
students and faculty. The admi­
nistration has expressed very lit­
tle enthusiasm towards any stu­
dent government and the presi­
dent of the student body has the 
unique opportunity to coordinate 
the students and their govern­
ment into a unit with which the 
administration must deal.
Use Group
The student body is only as 
strong as its various organiza­
tions. We can strengthen and unite 
the student body by making active 
use of the various fraternities, 
sororities, publications, dorm and 
commuter groups.
For instance, one way to deve­
lop greater school spirit would 
be to have an award presented 
after the football and basketball 
seasons to the student group that 
did the most to foster school spirit 
during that season. Judges would 
award points at each home game 
for any posters, signs, banners, 
skits, cheers, etc. that were used 
and afterwards the total points 
of each organizations would attend 
these events, increasing interest 
and eventually the quality of the 
teams.
Skibo has always been a pro­
blem in the past. It has not ser­
ved an effective purpose as a 
student union. Many attempts to 
remedy this situation have some­
how not succeeded. It is impera­
tive that all obstacles be removed 
from the path of a more personal, 
intimate, student union belonging 
to the students.
Student Court
Another thing that must be con­
sidered is the student court sys­
tem. This must be made clear 
and more concise so that it can 
begin to function as it has not 
in the past.
It is only through increased 
student interest that the student 
government and in effect the stu­
dent body can survive. As presi­
dent, I shall endeavor to have 
student government demonstrate 
that It is an effective body for 
action as well as expression.
Handley Stresses 
Congress Goals
In past years, the student body 
of Carnegie Tech has been subject­
ed to numerous schemes designed 
to arouse school spirit. Someday 
a revolution may begin, but until 
then this approach is unrealistic.
School spirit is not an ultimate 
goal. Lack of interest by the stu­
dents indicates that they are getting 
the most out of school in other 
ways. SG should be for those who 
consider it part of their education 
sider it part of their education 
and are interested in the institu­
tion as such. One purpose of SG 
is to effectively express student 
needs to the administration, and in 
turn, to inform the students of the 
reasons for administrative deci­
sions. In the past, SG has been 
successful in polling student opin­
ion. However, if it is to become 
more effective, it must do more 
than simply inform: it must pre­
sent realistic solutions to pro­
blems.
Government's Purpose
I am a candidate because Iwould 
like to see SG represent the stu­
dent body and promote student in­
terest — no more and no less. 
The new constitution limits the 
Senate to those students who are 
actively interested in SG. With 
the strong executive provided for 
by the constitution, the student 
body chooses the direction of its 
government through the presiden­
tial elections. One unfortunate re­
sult could be a government which 
forces school spirit and its acti­
vities on the students. A more ac­
ceptable possibility would be a 
government which would aggres­
sively fight for student needs.
I have been active in SG for two 
years as chairman of several com­
mittees (Parking, Student Union, 
Food Service). A working know­
ledge of SG is a prerequisite for 
the office of President. Over and 
above this I would offer the under­
graduate body a choice between 
“flag-waving” and realism inStu- 
dent Government.
Orens Considers 
Student Interest
In recent years our student go­
vernment has gained more for the 
student body than we might ima­
gine. Our student activities bud­
gets have reached unprecedented 
highs and administrative interest 
and support for student activities 
has never been better. Yet dur­
ing this same period student sup­
port for our government has dwin­
dled to a precarious level. In fact, 
last fall it became obvious that the 
student government as conceived 
in 1956 would no longer be effec­
tive. At that time we embarked 
on a new constitution — one that 
would initiate a revitalization of 
student government and a rebirth 
of student support. This spring 
we will see the new constitution 
in action. Through it the entire 
student body will become more 
closely associated with the govern­
ment. For the first time in many 
years there will no longer be a 
Chairman of Student Congress, 
elected by a mere fraction of the 
students, but a President of the 
Student Body, elected by the en­
tire undergraduate full-time stu­
dent population. As a representa­
tive of the whole student body the 
President can more truly be re­
cognized as a spokesman for the 
students. He can present their 
views to the Administration and 
with student support he can better 
implement a new and more active 
student government.
Activity Committee
The President of the Student 
Body must draw the best possible 
people into government. He must 
encourage participation in com­
mittee work and strive for a more 
efficient utilization of committees. 
As yet the vast potential of many 
committees is untapped. The Food 
Service Committee should do more 
than just advise the food service 
of the student desires concerning 
the food in Morewood Gardens and 
Skibo, it should also take an ac­
tive interest in the planning and 
administration of the service. Si­
milarly the Academic Advisory 
Committee should work even more 
; closely with the Administration in 
investigating academic policy. Al­
so the Tech Committee should be 
reorganized to promote increas­
ed interest in Tech athletics. This 
committee should also present to 
the Administration the student’s 
views about the role of varsity 
athletics on campus.
Communication
With the division of the executive 
and legislative functions in our new 
government the President must 
work even more closely with the 
Vice-president. He should strive 
with the Vice-president for in­
creased communication. He must 
be knowledgable on all facets of 
Senate business, and lend his sup­
port and aid whenever necessary. 
He should also present to the stu­
dents and Executive Council an un­
biased view of the Senate legisla­
tion.
Next year the President should 
strive for the completion of Ad­
ministrative promises. For three 
years we have been promised a 
student bulletin board and in all that 
time we have yet to see any con­
struction. This year remodeling of 
Skibo was to begin. Here, too, the 
work has been extremely sluggish. 
Also the student government has 
been promised a percentage of the 
income from the vending machines 
in Skibo. As yet we have re­
ceived no revenue. It is time 
that the student body through its 
president, confront the Admini­
stration with these situations and 
with a unified student approach 
these promises will certainly be 
implemented.
Student Support
As President of the Student Body 
I could not guarantee miracles. To 
have a student government in which 
we are all proud will take hard 
work, not only by its leaders, but 
also by the students. Good com­
mittee chairman and represen­
tatives must be drawn from the 
student body and most important 
they must have the support of the 
entire students. With your support
I would be proud to lead our new 
government,
Patross: VP Must 
Cooperate in Job
There will be several important 
issues facing the student body and 
its Student Government in the near 
future which will require prompt 
and effective action in order to 
avoid any inefficiency and redun­
dancy which may occur. One of 
the more important problems is to 
establish a sense of continuity 
within the government with parti­
cular emphasis on the more im­
portant work of the committees. 
It is necessary that these commit­
tees establish far-reaching goals 
which can be effectively worked 
toward, if necessary, for more 
than a one year time span. Per­
haps even more outstanding is the 
problem of defining and refining 
the new constitution in order to 
cope with several areas on cam­
pus life which it may not ade­
quately cover. The Carnegie Tech 
student government now has a 
framework which should enable 
that body to assert its rights and 
assume its responsibility to de­
termine and govern its own acti­
vities.
Encourage Events
Each of the committees has an 
important job to perform, es­
pecially the Food Service Com­
mittee with Its new food plan and 
the Union Committee which deals 
with student activities in Skibo. 
It seems necessary to make an at­
tempt to promote and increase stu­
dent spirit and pride not only In 
athletic events but also in the 
school as a whole. Perhaps ttts 
can be accomplished best by con­
tinuing to improve Skibo as L* stu­
dent center as well as encourag­
ing the re-establishment of old tra­
ditions and taking steps which may 
lead to the establishment of new 
ones. In addition the growth of 
Homecoming, Greek Sing, and 
Spring Carnival should be en­
couraged.
Cooperation
In other areas student govern­
ment should provide a good sys­
tem to accommodate the needs of 
the student body and the aims of 
the administration in order to fur­
ther facilitate the enactment of 
new programs to help the student, 
such as the expansion of library 
hours and the creation of the Aca­
demic Advisory Committee which 
enables students and administra­
tors to discuss academic policy. 
Also, student government should 
be able to work with the Council of 
Fraternity Presidents, Panhel- 
lenic Council, the Association of 
Women Students, and Men’s Dor­
mitory Council in any matters in 
which it can help in the growth 
and development in their respec­
tive areas.
It can be seen that the office of 
Vice President of the student body 
as defined by the new constitution 
is a position which will require 
time and effort to work out quick­
ly and efficiently the details and 
execution of these and other pro­
blems that may arise. At all tim­
es the Vice President must work 
closely with the President, the 
Executive Council, and the Senate.
I would like to devote my time to 
the office of Vice President and the 
activities of the student govern­
ment, If elected to the position of 
Vice President I will do my best 
to deal with the problems at hand 
and see that the Senate reaches the 
most effective and feasible solution 
possible.

Great Scot Sells First Issue; 
Sound Footing Forseen
The “Great Scot’*, Carnegie Tech’s newly-revived 
humor magazine, went over the top financially by sell­
ing nearly a thousand copies of its pioneer issue last week. Sales, along with funds from fraternity and soro­
rity advertising in the magazine, gave the staff of the 
“Scot’* a sound footing for continuing publication next 
year. -----------------------------------
Dave Kiefer, recently appoint­
ed copy editor, says the Scot has 
no definite publishing schedule, 
but he hopes to have the magazine 
come out “about five times a 
year." “We hope to have another 
issue for Fall Festival,” says Kie­
fer.
Kiefer is one of a “triumvi­
rate” of editors who will direct 
the Scot’s destinites throughout 
the next school year. The other 
two are Brooks Gilbert, business 
editor, and Jim Boyd, printing 
editor.
Original Scot
The original Great Scot, long 
a campus tradition, folded in 1960 
when Student Congress voted to 
remove its recognition and finan­
cial support of the magazine, and 
it went under. According to George 
K, Brown, Dean of Student Affairs, 
the Scot had “deteriorated badly” 
and was “no longer humorous ... 
just purely smutty.” Although the 
administration did not initiate pro­
ceedings to disown the Scot, and 
in no way “banned” it, they ap­
proved Student Congress’s de­
cision rt^t to recognize it.
Early last fall a group of Tech 
students decided to bring back the 
Scot. Bruce Chamberlain, a so­
phomore chemical engineer, was 
selected editor-in-chief by mutual 
consent. Eventually the size of the 
staff grew to about thirteen. Lack 
of printable or worthwhile material 
was a problem, due mainly to the 
failure of expected contributions 
from non-staff members to mater­
ialize but by spring the Scot edi­
tors had enough to put together 
a magazine.
Permission Granted 
When the staff set up a table 
in Baker Hall and started selling 
copies last week, they did not rea­
lize that they needed permission 
to solicit on campus. But, after 
some consultation with Dean Brown 
and a phone call to Tom Glass- 
berg, chairman of Executive Coun­
cil of Student Congress, the Scot 
got the go-ahead and sold out.
The Scot is supposedly “design­
ed to round out other campus pub­
lications by giving students a 
chance to see themselves in a new 
and different light. Its tone is that 
of light satire, not by any means 
meant to be offensive, but discreet­
ly allowing the students to laugh 
at themselves.”
Whether or not to operate as 
an officially recognized Carnegie 
Tech student activity is a ques­
tion yet unresolved by Scot edi­
tors. If the Scot were recogniz­
ed by Student Congress it would, 
after a year’s probationary per­
iod, have the financial backing of 
the school, providing some secu­
rity if sales were to drop off 
suddenly.
Recognition Vetoed 
However, its policies would be 
subject to review by Pi Delta Ep­
silon, the journalism honorary. 
Kiefer, at a recent Student Con­
gress meeting, asked for and re­
ceived unanimous consent by Con­
gress members to recognize the 
Scot, Executive Council vetoed the 
decision by a 5-3 vote. Glassberg, 
who as Chairman of Exec Council 
could not vote but was a spokes­
man against recognizing the ma­
gazine, said the Scot was not the 
type of magazine that would bene­
fit by being subjected to review _ 
and outside control. TOe Scot can 
continue as an independent publlca-. 
tlon with no interference, but ¦ 
would, as mentioned previously, • 
need the school’s approval to sell 
on campus.
At any rate, If the Scot were;
to go “official”, it would have to 
find a faculty advisor. No faculty 
member has been formally appro­
ached, but the staff expects no 
difficulty in getting an advisor 
if necessary.
Right now, the only definite plans 
of the Scot editors are to expand 
the size of the magazine “without 
increasing the price of each is­
sue,” and their most pressing 
problem is to pick up several 
more staff members. Brooks Gil­
bert seeks immediate contact with 
any student who wants to contri­
bute material, work on produc­
tion, make suggestions, or offer 
criticism.
Delta Skull Call
Delta Skull has announced its 
members for 1966 - 67: Robert 
Black, Bruce Burggrat, Bruce 
Chamberlain, Bernard Dobroski, 
William P. Feldkamp, Marshall 
Gile, and Harvey Gillis. Donald 
Infeld, Hugh Kepets, Ted Manko- 
vich, Alan Offstein, Robert Rose, 
Vance Rutan, Lester Silverman, 
George Uram, and Leonard Wane- 
tik were also named.
Tech Requires 
Insurance
All foreign students will be re­
quired to purchase, by the fall 
term, 1966, an accident - illness 
insurance policy especially de­
signed for their protection.
The Foreign Student Advisor 
may except from this requirement 
students who present evidence of 
comparable insurance coverage. 
The coverage required is actually 
an extension of the Carnegie Stu­
dent Medical Insurance Plan so 
as to include major medical pro­
tection.
Costs for approximately one ca­
lendar year under the Carnegie 
Plan are as follows:
Student Only — *Basic Policy, 
$20; Major Medical $5.85; »Total 
Cost $25.85.
Student Spouse — »Basic Policy, 
$56; Major Medical $11.50; »Total 
Cost $67.50.
Student Family — »Basic Poli­
cy $71; Major Medical $13.95; 
»Total Cost $84.95.
»Premium for the basic policy 
is subject to change by September 
12, 1966.

Commencement on Monday, June 
6, are requested to park in their 
regularly assigned areas, ex­
cept in the case of the Skibo re­

gestions and to offer the admini­
stration’s point of view.

First South Africans Attend 
Program For Executives
The first South Africans ever to attend Carnegie 
Tech’s “Program for Executives’ * in its 13 years 
are participating in an intensive study of economic, 
social, and technological changes affecting today’s 
businessman.
Max Lees, director of M. Lees 
and Associates, and his two em­
ployees, consult for various indus­
trial concerns. Lees graduated 
from Witwatersrand University in 
1953 in Mechanical Engineering, 
and did graduate work at Stevens 
Institute of Technology in 1956.
Otto G. Schmidtke, manager of 
Veka, Ltd., which employs 750 
people, attended textile engineer-
ing school at the Designing Aca­
demy in Germany and studied pro­
duction engineering in South Afri­
ca. He has also been associat­
ed with Harvard Business School 
and Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology.
Both men were selected for the 
program, as were all 35 executiv­
es, on the expectation that each 
will soon be in top management.!

We can get very technical.
At Berlitz, we can give you a highly 
concentrated course dealing with technical 
words and phrases required for your masters 
or doctorate degree.
Whatever your field is—chemistry, 
electronics, medicine, anything—we speak 
your language. In every language.
Of course, if it’s German you want, you’ll 
still learn things like, “Auf Wiedersehen.”
But we won’t let you say it until you’ve learned

* December. Hie proposal, which 
was “To equalize eligibility re­
quirements for varsity and intra­
mural players, especially with re­
gard to players on scholastic pro­
bation,” was presented by Dean 
Brown to the Administration’s 
Academic Affairs Committee. The 
committee acted on this proposal 
by eliminating all formal restric­
tions on extracurricular activities 
applied to students on probation, 
a policy decision which has al­
ready received considerable pub­

Frank M. Cratsley, Carnegie 
Tech athletic director, reported 
on the football schedule through 
‘69, and indicated the addition to 
the schedule of such schools as 
John Hopkins and Western Re­
serve, which have academic and 
athletic programs comparable to 
that of Carnegie Tech. Several 
other schools suggested by the 
board as possibilities for future 
football opponents were Swarth- 
more, Washington University, 
Drexel Tech, RPI, Kenyon, and 
Dickinson. Similar discussion en­
sued about next year’s basketball 
schedule.
The proposal for the organiza­
tion of a varsity lacrosse team, 
which has been under considera­
tion by the board since November, 
was rejected, primarily for two 
reasons. First, Athletic Director 
Cratsley reported that the near­
est potential opponents were 
schools such as the U.S. Naval 
Academy, Johns Hopkins, Denison, 
and Ohio Wesleyan, all of which 
are as distant as the most dis­
tant football teams which Carne­
gie Tech plays. A typical sched­
ule of ten games would involve 
five long trips per year with the 
expenditure of a large amount of 
money, and would take up a con­
siderable amount of the players' 
class time. Second, Carnegie Tech 
has no satisfactory field on which 
to play.
L A few other items of business 
were discussed, including the cri­
teria for awarding varsity let­
ters and the athletic award sys­
tem in general, but no definite 
actions were taken by the board.

- - 1Tech Whips Bethany 
In Track Thriller
Tech’s track team won its clo­
sest meet of the year last Wed­
nesday as the Tartans defeated 
Bethany on their home track by a 
score of 71-65. The meet was 
close from start to finish as af­
ter only two events the score was 
10-8 Bethany, and by the start of 
the last event, the mile relay, the 
score was Tech 66, Bethany 65. 
The lead in the relay changed se­
veral times to give this the most 
exciting ending of the year.
Tech’s top scorer of the day 
was Chris Macosko, who took first 
place in the half mile, mile, and 
two-mile runs. Tech swept only one 
event all day and that was the 
pole vault. Bethany was unable to 
sweep anything completely away 
from the Tartans. Bethany was a 
strong team, but Tech won on sec­
onds and thirds due to good back 
up men. Two of the more out­
standing instances were Berny 
Flynn who ran a good time in a 
fast half mile race to almost take 
third and sweep the event from 
Bethany, and Pete Bair, who let 
loose and threw the shot put 39* 
8” for third place, a throw which 
would have won Tech’s first meet 
of the year.
Bethany was the eighth team 
Tech met this year, and the Tar­
tans record is now 6-2. Today is 
Tech’s last meet as they travel to 
Allegheny for a triangular meet 
with Allegheny and Grove City.

Senior Women
A dinner for senior women will 
be held on Thursday, May 12, in 
the Morewood Gardens Blue Room.
Invitations have been sent out to 
170 commuters and Morewood re- } 
sidents. Reservations maybe made 
at no charge.
The only three wheel machine en­
tered spun around 180 degrees just 
as it got into Frew Street. The 
driver, Bob Serabin, was not hurt. 
A veteran observer reports that the 
blue coaster was going faster than 
any machine that day. The “Dol­
phin” apparently sheared the rub­
ber off its nose wheel.

Phi Kap's “Snorpus**.
Warm weather and a section of 
new pavement brought faster times 
and tight competition to this year’s 
Buggy Sweepstakes. Beta Theta 
Pi won its third straight cham­
pionship, clocking a 2:27.02 in the 
preliminaries. This is believed 
to be the best time since ATO tied 
their oWti record of 2:25.0 in 
1957.
ATO’s “Golden Goose” took 
second in 2:29.5, their best in four 
years. Pi KA’s “Shark” was a close 
third in 2:30.5. Their prelim time 
was a second faster; the best for 
the “Shark” since 1957. Nearly two 
thirds of the entries improved 
over their 1965 performances.
Despite several long delays the 
Spring Carnival crowd and many 
Pittsburgh fans witnessed several 
exciting races between the 20 en­
tries. In the Saturday finals, though 
they had the inside lane, Beta’s 
basketball powerhouse of Don Kee­
fer and Ray Burdett got their bug­
gy into the freeroll with a 10 to 
15 yard lead. PiKA and the 
“Goose” were dead even behind 
Beta.
In the coast the low slung ATO 
machine pulled away and caught 
Beta’s “00” just as they reached
BTP streaks to 3rd consecutive first place finish. Giving chase are PiKA, 
on left, and ATO, on right.

the third hill pushers.
On the back stretch the veteran 
Beta pushers, Ed Dawson, Bob No­
lan and Bob Livengood, were no 
match and steadily pulled ahead. 
PiKA’s relay also was strong as 
Dave Simons caught ATO on hill 
three. ATO’s Steve Weiss held 
push bar to pushbar with PiKA’s 
Ben Brown started to pull away 
on hill four, but his buggy clash­
ed wheels with the Goose and fish­
tailed.
On hill five Jim “the Giant” 
Brezovic kicked enough to give 
ATO second.
The consolation heat saw a 
strong performance by TOP’S new 
“White Dwarf*’. Driven in a crou­
ched position, this bicycle model 
sported 26 inch racing tires cov­
ered with white airplane silk. The 
“Dwarf’ improved over its wind­
blown 2:33.29 of the prelims but 
no official times are given for the 
consolations. Though Beta’s “000” 
finished second, they were given 
the sixth place cup because SAE’s 
bike had a better performance 
in the preliminaries. SAE and TDP 
had demanded that their prelim 
times be used if these were lower. 
Their chairmen felt the cars park­
ed on the course Saturday morn­
ing would hamper their drivers.
These cars, mistakenly allowed 
to park across from Phipps Con­
servatory caused a delay of over 
an hour in the finals. Friday’s 
heats were also 45 minutes late 
due to problems with the new 
electric timers.
Beta Sigma Rho’s “Dolphin” 
had the only mishap of the race.

Phi Kap’s “Snorpus” cut over 
ten seconds off 1965’s performance 
to take eighth. SN cut 18 seconds 
and moved into the top half. They 
qualified for design by tying for 
ninth place with ATO’s 13 year 
old “Andy I”. The Delts impro­
ved with a new shell and the dorms 
continued to improve as they cut 
three seconds this year. TDP’s 
“Black Widow** was disqualified 
for failing to cross the finish line 
with a pusher.
In the buggy design judging, 
held early Friday morning, Beta 
Theta Pi took first place with 
“00**. Sigma Nu*s radical “Li­
zard”, with a Ford Lotus-type bo­
dy, bicycle-type wheels, and shock 
absorbers, took second.

As they always do, the buggy races once again left more than their 
share of surprises. Beta Sig once again ran into the jinx that has tra­
ditionally left them out of the sweepstakes. The three-wheeled “Dol­
phin” kept up the tradition of such things as losing push bars and being 
run over by motor scooters when they spun out and hit the curb at the 
Scaife Hall turn. Being the pre-tournament pick for third place, the Dol­
phin spun out, broke its axle, and limped in with the worst time of the 
day at 3:12.
Tau Delt’s “White Dwarf” proved to be the big surprise of the sweep­
stakes when it finished with an unofficial 2:28 in the consolation heat 
to cinch fourth place and give them what may have been the second 
fastest time of the day. It would seem that bikes are definitely here 
to stay.
Phi Kaps “Snorpus” became one of the most improved buggies 
on campus when she bettered her ‘65 time by 11 seconds with a 2:39 
for a strong eighth place. Sigma Nu*s “Lizard” also was greatly 
improved when they brought her from a dead-last finish in ‘65 to ninth 
place this year.
But perhaps the biggest disappointment of the sweepstakes was the ab­
sence of Kappa Sig in the competition. Kappa Sig had entered a buggy, 
its first in four years, but was unable to compete on race day because 
of a broken axle. I hope that this disappointment will not discourage 
Kappa Sig from competing next year. I’m sure we’re all looking forward 
to a bigger and better sweepstakes next year and there’s nothing that 
can improve the races more than expanded competition.
