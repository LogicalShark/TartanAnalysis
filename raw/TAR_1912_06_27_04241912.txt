Vol. VI. No. 27 Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pa. April 24, 1912
CHARTER GRANTED TO 
CARNEGIE INSTITUTE 
OF TECHNOLOGY.
Power to Grant Degrees Finally At­
tained.
. For some time the graduates and un­
dergraduates of this institution have 
known that steps were under way to 
incorporate and to obtain the power to 
grant degrees in pure and Applied Sci­
ence and in the arts. It is with great 
pleasure that The Tartan announces 
that the efforts of Dr. Hamerschlag and 
the Board of Trustees have met with 
the success. A charter has been grant­
ed to the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology which gives the Board of Trust­
ees the power to grant the desired de-
grees.
Director Hamerschlag has given the 
following letter to The Tartan for pub­
lication. It was read at the Alumni 
Smoker in the Hotel Henry Saturday 
evening and was greeted with tremen­
dous enthusiasm. The undergraduates 
will be no less pleased with the infor­
mation contained therein than were the 
graduates. The letter is as follows : 
April 19th, 1912.
The Faculty and students of this in- 
^ stitution will be glad to get word that 
ajthe Board of Trustees have been grant­
ed a charter for the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology which gives them the 
power to grant degrees in pure and ap­
plied science and in the arts.
The Court of Common Pleas of Alle­
gheny County in issuing this charter 
has made it possible for us to look 
forward to the Commencement days 
of the future with the expectation that 
many of the young men and women who 
are educated in this institution will re­
ceive degrees consistent with the courses 
they have pursued.
The changing of the name from the 
CARNEGIE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS 
to the CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF 
TECHNOLOGY has also been decided 
upon and it is hoped that by this change 
of name the four Schools may become 
more closely associated without in any
sense changing the names of the four 
schools from that which they now 
bear.
It will take some time for the Board 
of Trustees to finally act on the. By- 
Laws with a view to receiving recom­
mendations as to candidates for degrees 
and the students are therefore urged 
to be patient, while these very neces­
sary steps are being taken so that we 
may conform with the requirements of 
the law.
ARTHUR A. HAMERSCHLAG 
Director.
DO YOU WANT THE MORE- 
WOOD AVENUE EXTENSION?
ARE YOU WILLING TO WORK 
FOR IT?
Every Student has probably seen 
the plans of the Morewood Avenue 
Extension, or has heard them talked 
about until he knows what is meant 
by the term Every Student, probably 
knows that under the bridge con­
necting the schools with Forbes 
street will be placed our new gym. 
Every Student knows where the new 
athletic field will be located and how 
greatly it is to be desired. Every 
Student knows how difficult it is to 
reach the buildings from any of the 
car lines, especially in bad weather. 
Every student who thinks for him- 
I self ought to be able to figure out 
| the saving in and convenience of the 
Moorewood avenue extension and 
bridge, if built. Every student ought 
to be willing to do a little work and 
assist in the obtaining of this struc­
ture.
Are YOU willing to work for it? 
If YOU are, write a letter to the 
Pittsburgh Councils and tell them 
just how badly that bridge is needed. 
If YOU are willing to work for it, 
see to it that all your classmates 
and friends write to the Councils and 
express thier sentiments regarding 
this matter. If YOU are willing to 
do this, see that it is done at once, 
not next week or next month, but 
now. Show YOUR Carnegie Spirit. 
Prove that YOU are working for the 
betterment of Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. Make people feel that 
YOU are a real live citizen and want 
what YOU want wdien YOU want 
it.
Write to the City Fathers in the 
City Hall and tell them how we, 
students of The Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, feel about the More- 
wood avenue bridge, how badly it is 
needed, and how much it is wanted.
DO IT NOW, and assist in the 
ultimate greatness of the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology.
THE PAGEANT TO BE GIVEN 
BY THE APPLIED DE­
SIGN STUDENTS.
The pageant, given in connection 
with the laying of the cornerstone of 
the Building of the School of Applied 
Design, will be staged on a raised 
platform adjoining the location of the 
cornerstone, with a scenery back­
ground representing the completed fa­
cade of the new building. This huge 
representation will embrace the five 
niches, featuring the different periods 
of architecture and decoration, and 
has been painted by students of the 
school.
The celebration is entirely a stu­
dent affair, with a double significance 
inasmuch as it is to occur on Found­
er’s Day immediately after the exer­
cises in the Carnegie Music Hall. 
This will make the time about 4:30 
in the afternoon. The entire event 
is being put through by an eager and 
enthusiastic student body, as an ex­
pression of joy over the new building, 
that is being erected especially for 
the use of the Applied Design School. 
The work on the costumes and fit­
tings, as on the scenery, is the effort 
exclusively of the students them­
selves, directed by the professors in 
charge and committees from the vari­
ous student departments.
There are three prominent com­
mittees. The first on costumes con­
sists of Miss Eleanor Tener, Miss 
Louise R. K. Miller and Miss Murna 
Dunkle.
The committee, acting as captains 
of the various groups, comprises 
Frank X. Keally, Greek and Roman 
period; L. C. Dillenback, Egyptian 
and Oriental; J. L. Ruth, Mediaeval; 
William Gehron, Renaissance; F. C. 
Disque, 17th Century French; Wal­
ter Jones, Jr., and A. H. Gilkison, 
modern.
Edwin B. Lee, chairman, Dean C. 
Russell Hewlett, Edward J. Weber, 
Charles J. Taylor, and Professor Gab­
riel Ferrand act as an advisory fac­
ulty committee, assisting the students 
in the preparation of the pageant.
From the robing rooms in the pres­
ent quarters of the School of Applied 
Design the students will march to the 
platform in front of the new building, 
pass around the cornerstone and con­
tribute their offerings to the exercises. 
There will be music by the Carnegie 
Tech. Band, and also choral singing 
by groups of students from all four 
of the Carnegie Technical Schools. 
A new Tech. song will be sung for 
the first time, the words for which 
I have been recently written by Prof. 
Chas. J. Taylor, a member of the fac­
ulty of the School of Applied Design. 
It has not yet been announced wrho 
will lay the corner stone, but it will

We have printed in another part of 
this issue the new song written by Mr. 
Taylor of the School of Applied Design. 
This song promises to fill a longfelt 
want having those qualities which go 
to make up a really great college song. 
It is undoubtedly the best we have had 
offered and all should join in a vote of 
thanks to the author, Mr. Taylor.
Tomorrow is most decidedly the 
School of Applied Design’s day. They 
have much to be happy over and in this 
joy The Tartan joins. We trust that 
the weather will be as brilliant as the 
red paint on their new building and 
wish them all success in their celebra­
tion.

WANTED—NEW CHEERS.
As was pointed out to the Science 
men last Thursday morning, the chang­
ing of the name calls for the changing 
of our cheers and yells. We have 
never had nearly enough of these and 
now is the time to remedy the fault. 
Let every student think about this mat­
ter and give vent to his pleasure at 
hearing all the good things which have 
happened this week by writing a cheer 
or song. Turn these in and let us try 
them out at the first opportunity. Help 
the good cause along.
—o—
THE CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF 
TECHNOLOGY.
Elsewhere in this issue the definite 
announcements are made of the obtain­
ing of the charter, with the degree 
granting power, and the changing of 
the name from-The Carnegie Technical 
Schools to The Carnegie Institute of
Technology. The pleasure with which 
these announcements will be greeted 
will not be lessened by the fact that we 
have been more or less aware that the 
steps under way were leading to a suc­
cessful conclusion. The graduates and 
undergraduates should remember in 
their joy that these things so desirable 
were not obtained without the spend­
ing of much time, trouble, and thought 
by those who had the matter in charge. 
To obtain this charter, Director Hamer- 
schlag and the Committee on Technical 
Schools have been put to much work 
and those who are to profit by that 
work should express their appreciation. 
Credit to those to whom credit is due.
The changing of the name of the 
institution from The Carnegie Tech­
nical Schools to The Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology is one which will 
please all. As Dr. Hamerschlag point­
ed out in his letter, this in no way af­
fects the names which the four schools 
now bear. The feeling the Director 
expressed when he said, “It is hoped 
that by this change of name the four 
Schools may become more closely as­
sociated,” is the feeling which all true 
Carnegie men have when they look 
towards the great Technology to come. 
We have made great strides in our 
short existence and have accomplished 
much. With the changed conditions 
we look to the seeing of our Alma 
Mater more quickly take her place 
in the front ranks of the world’s great 
educational institutions.
DIRECTOR ISSUES HIS ANNUAL 
REPORT.
Contains Much Interesting Matter.
Director Hamerschlag has issued 
his ninth annual report. It contains 
extracts from the reports of the Exec­
utive officers and makes, in all, a book­
let of 62 pages.
The Director speaks of the meeting 
held last April in Carnegie Music 
Hall at which Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie 
spoke to the students and of the new 
charter which was shortly after ap­
plied for. Elsewhere in this issue will 
be found the latest news concerning 
the charter and the degree granting 
power.
In speaking of the matter of stu­
dent health, Director Hamerschlag 
says, “We are hopeful that the time 
may not be far distant when we will 
have some form of student lodging- 
house or dormitory, which will be 
simple, sanitary and reasonable.” In 
his hopes the students will join, es­
pecially those who are unfortunate to 
be forced into the ordinary Pittsburgh 
boarding house.
In speaking of Camp Louise Car­
negie, Dr. Hamerschlag points out 
the many ways in which it can be 
used, both for purposes of instruc­
tion and recreation. He also includes 
three views taken at the camp, one 
showing the mansion house, another 
a group of civil engineers at work, 
while the third pictures some of the 
miners working the coal mine on the 
property. The Tartan hopes to pub­
lish these pictures, together with oth­
ers taken at the same time, at no late 
date.
Another matter, which is touched 
upon, both in the Director’s own re­
port and the report of Dean Leete to 
the Director, is the question of schol-’ 
arships. In another part of this is­
sue will be found the requirements 
laid down for the Entrance Scholar­
ships, the founding of which was an­
nounced in The Tartan several months 
ago. But the Scholarships spoken of 
in the report are scholarships of a 
different nature and purpose. To quote 
from the Director’s report:
“The faculties have brought to the 
attention of the Director their belief 
that the standards and spirit of schol­
arship could be materially enhanced 
if it were possible to offer to the stu­
dents certain graduate prizes to be 
called either scholarships or fellow­
ships; and that, with a number of 
these scholarships available, many 
students, in their competition to se­
cure the awards, would definitely raise 
the standard and spirit of the educa­
tion for which we stand. With these 
graduate prizes it is hoped that we 
may interest a number of our stu­
dents in the importance of continuing 
their studies either in this institution 
or elsewhere. If they remain with us 
they will be invaluable as an influ­
ence on the undergraduates; if they 
travel abroad and study elsewhere 
they will be ideally equipped to be ul­
timately used as members of our own 
faculty. The Director strongly en­
dorses these views and hopes that it 
may be possible in the future to make 
them operative.”
Dean Leete, in his report to the Di­
rector, extracts from which are in­
cluded in the Director’s report, said, 
in speaking on the same subject:
“Just what form such a plan should 
take is difficult to determine. The 
means which are employed in some 
institutions do not appeal to me. To 
excuse the unusually bright student 
from any portion of his course seems 
to me both to be directly opposed to 
the very quality which it is desired 
to develop and also seems impractic­
able in an engineering school. The 
plan followed in some other institu­
tions of giving the high-stand student 
an additional allowance of absences 
would tend to nip in the bud the evo­
lution of scholarly qualities. The one 
other method generally employed, that 
of rewarding the exceptional student 
by means of a money fellowship seems 
to offer some promise. If we could 
each year offer one fellowship of $500 
to the most promising graduate for 
further study at some other institu­
tion or for a study of engineering 
operations, I believe it would prove 
a great stimulus to the development 
of competition in scholarship, from 
which some of the desirable attributes 
of the genuine scholar would be 
evolved.”
That some such step would meet 
with student favor goes without say­
ing. Nor will any gainsay the value 
of such fellowship to the institution. 
The Tartan trusts that some plan look­
ing towards this end will be adopted 
in the near future.
The Bureau of Student Aid has 
done some very valuable work during 
the past year, as is pointed out by 
Dr. Hamerschlag. In the report of
Secretary Field statistics concerning 
this Bureau are given and, being of 
considerable interest and value, are 
reproduced here.
“Briefly summarized, the results of 
the work of the Bureau of Student 
Aid between March 1st, 1911, and Feb­
ruary 29th, 1912, may be stated as fol­
lows:

Summer em- 
plyoment .. 9,849.25 (f)
$160,994.75 $113,619.50
“Two further aspects of our work, 
difficult to tabulate, but exceedingly 
important, deserve special mention 
here:
First—It is estimated that 182 stu­
dents who would otherwise have been 
obliged to drop out, have been held in 
school through employment secured 
for them by the Bureau.
Second — Through correspondence 
and personal talks with employers be­
tween 30 and 40 night students have 
been directly assisted in obtaining pro­
motion and increase in salary in the 
firms in which they are at present 
employed.”
The comparative statistics for the 
two years show the gains made. It 
is to be hoped that the student-body 
as a whole will soon realize the im­
portance of this Buerau and assist 
in its work.
As to the student activities the opin­
ion seems to prevail that they are as 
well off as could be expected. The 
greatest gain, according to the Sec­
retary's report, was in the formation 
of the Student Publicity Bureau. The 
results of this new Bureau’s activities 
have justified its creation and exist­
ence.
“The whole report spells progress, 
progress of the real substantial kind. 
We, as students, should be pleased 
with this and look forward with ex­
pectancy to the coming years which 
surely hold much in store for us.---------o---------
Did YOU ever have to take that 
long walk over the bridge and past 
the Institute when it was raining cats 
and dogs? Did YOU like it? Well 
then, write that letter NOW.
Would YOU like to have the new 
athletic field a year sooner than you 
otherwise would? Then write YOUR 
letter to the Councils NOW.

NEW SCHOOL SONG.
Last Monday morning we had pre­
sented to us a new school song. The 
author is Mr. Charles T. Taylor, In­
structor in Illustration in the School of 
Applied design. Mr. Taylor has called 
his song, “Hail Carnegie,” and has 
dedicated it to Director Hamerschlag. 
The tune chosen is that splendid Aus­
trian hymn and the words which Mr. 
Taylor has written are in keeping with 
the spirit of the music. We print the 
verses in full:
HAIL CARNEGIE.
Here where spangled wildernesses 
Robed the fountain of the west, 
Where the savage strife and stresses 
Brought the settlers’ crimson quest; 
Land of legend, glory, graces,
Gypsy tide and toiling shore,
’Mid thy hilltops Alma Mater 
Stands enthroned forevermore.
Hail Carnegie ! Alma Mater— 
Stand enthroned forevermore!
Here was heard the musket’s rattle, 
Round us rolled the thralling drum— 
All is hushed, no more they startle, 
Low we hear sweet labor’s hum, 
Art and science rule our battle,
In their pathway honor lies.
Hail Carnegie! Alma Mater—
Show the way that truth may rise! 
Hail Carnegie! Alma Mater— 
Show the way that truth may rise
Show the way—arouse, awaken 
Bear aloft thy beacon bright,
That our minds be ever taken,
Unto learning, unto light.
Stand in daytime’s storm unshaken, 
Guide through storm of deepest night 
Hail Carnegie ! Alma Mater—•
Stand for progress, peace and right! 
Hail Carnegje! Alma Mater— 
Stand for progress, peace and right!
Mr. McDowell had the Science men 
sing this new song, which they did with 
right good will. We have long needed 
a song of just this character and all 
students should make an effort to learn 
the words, since it promises to be popu­
lar and much used in the future.

THE ALUMNI SMOKER.
Graduates Hold Another Fine Af­
fair at The Henry.
The Alumni Association of the 
Schools of Applied Science and De­
sign held another smoker at the Hotel 
Henry on the evening of Saturday last. 
There was a large and enthusiastic 
turnout of “old grads,” who all ap­
peared to enjoy themselves to the ut­
most. The committee, which has had 
charge of these affairs certainly de­
serves much credit for the way in which 
they have done their work. Every de­
tail has been looked after and no 
trouble spared to make these smokers 
what they are, a decided success.
The entertainment of the evening 
consisted of a battle royal—and it was 
all of that—and the music was fur­
nished by a quartete from the Mandolin 
Club. President Smith stated that the 
several candidates for the proud title 
of “Tech Baby” had been invited to 
come and settle the dispute for once 
and all in a battle royal, no time limit.
The fight that followed pleased the 
Alumni highly. There were five con­
testants at the start and at the finish 
only two remained. After these two 
had argued their cases for a consider­
able length of time without either ob­
taining the count, President Smith, in 
his capacity as referee, declared the 
bout a draw. It is now up to the Reg­
istrar to donate two loving cups in­
stead of the one he promised to give 
to the “Tech Baby” when found.
The graduates agreed to write to the 
Pittsburgh Council and tell them how 
badly the Morewood extension is 
needed.
After refreshments were served, a 
business meeting was held, the smoker 
breaking up at about 12 o’clock.

JUNIOR CLASS MEETING.
Last Thursday at the close of the 
general lecture hour, the Juniors held 
a class meeting, with President Parry 
in the Chair. Reports from the Junior 
Prom Committee and the Club Room 
Committee were read and accepted. Mr. 
Duff, of the Thistle Board, reported the 
progress of the Thistle and the prob­
able date at which it would be out.- It 
was voted by the class to take an as­
sessment among the members to pay 
outstanding debts, and it is requested that 
all members of the class be ready to 
pay this assessment when the collector 
calls.
--------------o--------------
For the love of Mike, WRITE 
THAT LETTER NOW.
On account of the inability of Pres. 
Moffett, of Washington and Jefferson, 
to be present last Thursday morning 
at the general lecture hour, there was 
no lecture. A hurry-up call was sent 
for Mr. McDowell, who led in sing­
ing the school songs in his inimitable 
style and introduced a new one to the 
air of the Austrian National Anthem. 
Announcements were made by Pres. 
Knapp of the Senior class and rousing 
cheers were led by the leaders. It was 
the general impression that the hour 
was well spent and that more like it 
would be of great benefit to the stu­
dents.
Arrangements have been made for 
Pres. Moffett to occupy the platform 
Thursday, May 2nd.
COLVIN CHOSEN CAPTAIN.
The members of the 1911-12 ’Var­
sity basket ball team assembled last 
Thursday in the Field House, and 
elected R. W. P. Colvin, ’15, captain 
for the season of 1912-13. Colvin 
played center in every game of the 
past winter, and was the usual star. 
He holds the record for point-win- ! 
ning for the season, and was invalu­
able on the defensive. He possesses 
the confidence of his fellow players, 
has a cool head, and should make a 
model leader. The Tartan wishes 
Capt. Colvin success and victory 
throughout the next winter.
Do it first YOURSELF and then 
see that your friends get the habit.

4THE TARTAN
THIRD ANNUAL INTER­
SCHOOLS’ MEET.
Science Wins.
Last Saturday’s meet was a huge 
success in many respects. Although 
no School records were broken, its 
main object, viz., to get a general 
idea of what the men are now able 
to do, and to get new men on the 
field and encourage them, was fully 
accomplished. Several men took part 
in this meet that had never before 
entered into a similar event. The list 
of men entered for each event was 
surprisingly large, but many of the 
men did not show up at the last mo­
ment. The attendance, although not 
disappointing, could have been much 
better, the grand stand being filled 
to about one-fifth of its capacity only. 
The weather was fine and the condi­
tion of the field excellent.
On account of the base ball game 
to be played afterward, the meet was 
scheduled to commence at 12:30. Ow­
ing to delays, the first event did not 
start until 1:15, but later time was 
gained by running different events 
simultaneously. On account of the 
small number of men entered, no trial 
heats were run for the high and low 
hurdles and the 220-yard dash.
The prediction that there would be 
a close competition between the Sci­
ence and Design Schools proved true. 
For each event points were given as 
follows: First man, 5; 2nd man, 3;
3rd man, 1, and after the results of 
each event were known, the total 
score of the three schools at that 
time, was announced. When Hosey, 
Steinmetz and Gilkison placed in the 
220-yard dash, things looked very 
dangerous for Science. The score 
was then: Design 39, Science 29.
Then the results of the discus throw, 
shot put and broad jump were an­
nounced, and each of them served to 
reduce the handicap and to give Sci­
ence a lead which it was impossible 
to destroy. The final score was: 
Science, 68.5; Design, 52; Indus­
tries, 12.5.
The men that won the highest num­
ber of individual points are: Clair,
13 (Hammer, Discus, Shotput); 
Hosey, 10 (100 and 220-yard dash); 
Boots, 9 (broad jump, 100-yard dash, 
hammer); and Roessner, Cronin, 
Wait, Steinmetz, and Wilcox, each 
with 8 points.
When something more conspicu­
ous is going on at the same time, lit­
tle attention is generally paid by the 
public to the hammer and discus 
throw and shot put. But, although 
less spectacular, these weight events 
played an important part in securing 
the victory for the Science School. 
All three places in hammer, discus 
and shot put were won exclusively by 
Science men, thus giving them a lead 
of 27 points.
In the hammer throw, Clair, Hobbs 
and Boots qualified, Clair’s distance 
being 116 ft. 7.5 in. In the finals only 
Hobbs bettered his distance, but re­
mained second. In the discus throw 
Clair, Roessner and Parke qualified, 
but in the finals no better distances 
were made. Clair remained first
with 97 ft. 0.5 in., and Roessner and 
Parke took second and third place. 
Roessner won the shot put with 34 
ft. even, closely followed by Clair 
and Laboon.
The Design men showed up re­
markably well in the one mile, half 
mile, and quarter mile run, the 220 
yard dash and the low hurdles. The 
stars in these events were Hosey, 
Wait, Steinmetz, Wilcox, Murphy and 
Gilkinson, all of the Design School. 
The results of the one-mile run were 
as follows: Wait (D), time, 4:57 2-5; 
Hazelton, (D), 2nd, and Grupp (Ind) 
3rd. In the half mile run, Murphy 
reached the finish about half a foot 
ahead of Gilkinson, with Wildberg 
(S) third. Murphy’s time was 
2:10 3-5. In the quarter mile dash 
Steinmetz took first place in 54 4-5 
seconds, with Wilcox second and 
Murphy (D) third. The results of 
the 220-yard dash were Hosey, 1st, 
time 23 3-5; Steinmetz second and 
Gilkinson third. Wilcox took first 
place in the 220-yard low hurdles, al­
though he fell when jumping the first 
hurdle. His time was 31 seconds. 
Wait arrived second and Decker (S) 
third.
In the high and broad jumps the 
Science men easily plafced against 
Design. Harry Murphy took first 
place with 5 ft. 7 in. in the high jump. 
It will be remembered that he jumped 
5 ft. 8 in. at the P. A. A. meet, which 
is the school record. Cronin and 
Criswell were tied for second and 
third place and tossed. Cronin got 
second and Criswell third, but the 
four points were equally divided. In 
the broad jump Boots made 20 ft.
0.5 in., Cronin 19 ft. 9 in., and Kes- 
selman, 18 ft. 5 in.
Only three men were running in 
the 20 high hurdles. Decker (S) won 
in 19 seconds flat, Cronin taking sec­
ond place. Hatcher disqualified by 
missing the last hurdle.
The results of the 100-yard dash 
were as follows:
1st heat—Hosey, 10.3; Holliday and
Rauh.
2nd heat—Boots, 11.0; Kesselman and
Wellar.
Finals—1. Hosey (10 2-5); 2. Boots; 
Holliday and Rauh were tied for 
third, but the latter won the toss.
Grupp (Ind) won the two-mile run 
in 11.05 4-5, Kaul (S) taking second 
place, iynapp (S) and Buck (Ind) 
divided the point for third place. 
Wait, after leading for a short time, 
finally dropped out during the fourth 
round, on account of exhaustion due 
to previous runs.
The relay was perhaps the most 
interesting event of the day. Two 
teams wrere running: Design and
Science. The men running together 
were: McCrory and Boots, Wellar
and Frank Crawford, Wait and Wild­
berg, Hosey and Holliday. Wait 
I started about 20 feet behind Wild- 
j berg and finished about 30 feet ahead 
of him. Happy Holliday started to 
I swing his legs at an almost incred- 
' ible speed, but he could not entirely 
! reclaim the lost distance. The time 
| made by the Design team was 2:59 1-5 
| and by the Science team 3:02 2-5, 
| which is fast for the track.
The pole vault was the last event.
The men started out at a height of
7 feet, and after half an hour’s work 
the following results were obtained:
1. Lose (S), 8 ft. 10 in., 2—Criswell 
(Ind), 8 ft. 7 in., 3 Macklin (S).
LECTURE BEFORE FEDERATED 
ENGINEERING SOCIETIES.
Mr. H. K. Morse, Civil Engineer— 
Subject, The Panama Canal.
Whittington & Wade
Jenkins
An interesting lecture on the Panama 
Canal was delivered last Wednesday 
night before the Federated Engineer­
ing Socities of this Institute, by Mr. 
Morse, a consulting civil engineer of this 
city, recently returned from a trip to 
Panama.
The lecture was delivered in Room 113 
and was attended by forty men. Mr. 
Morse, in his introduction, remarked 
that the purpose of his trip -was not to 
be shown around by the officials and 
be given the same information he could 
get from the newspapers at home, but 
look around for himself, to get in touch 
with the working men and to get their 
point of view.
“The problem of taking care of the 
public health,” said the speaker, “is 
more difficult than the actual construction 
work itself“the reason why the 
French did not succeed in Panama, is 
because they did not appreciate the im­
portance of this question.” The French 
surveys, however, were all right, and 
Mr. Morse believes the U. S. Govern­
ment saved money by purchasing theise. 
The mosquitos can no more transmit 
malaria or fever, for the simple reason 
that all traces of these diseases have 
disappeared with the stagnant waters. 
All ditches have been drained or cov­
ered with oil, and the Canal Zone is 
now ahead of Pittsburgh as far as 
healthfulness is concerned.
The speaker had great admiration for 
the cement work at the Gatun locks. 
These locks are exceptionally great; al­
though not striking at first sight.
Mr. Morse found a different prop­
osition at the Culebra Cut. The prob­
lem here is to cut a trench through 
mountainous land, and the speaker has 
doubts as to the efficiency of the opera­
tions. He illustrated his views by a 
sketch on the blackboard showing the 
location of two big and dangerous 
cracks, on both sides of the trench from 
the top of the hills describing an arc 
to the bottom of the cut. There is 
grave danger of a landslide, said the 
speaker, and although the officials 
laughed at his fears, he wants to go 
back as soon as possible to prove the 
correctness of his views and to laugh 
at the officials’ misplaced confidence.
One of the most remarkable things, 
Mr. Morse says, is the good spirit and 
the willlingness of the men. They get 
good pay, ample allowance for sickness 
and vacation, good food and medical 
attention, and in return everybody is 
satisfied and always willing to help 
somebody else. Co-operation is the se­
cret of the progress made.
The lecture was followed by a hearty 
applause. Mr. Cornelius, President of 
the Civil Engineering Society, thanked 
the speaker for his very interesting talk. 
The meeting then adjourned to Room 
60, where some refreshments were in­
dulged in.

INDUSTRIES’ SMOKER AND 
BANQUET.

W. Stelle, secretary and treasurer; and 
Messrs. F. A. Stein, Henry Finch, C. J. 
Daum, J. A. Martin, H. A. Woellmer,

After a vote of thanks had been given 
to the performers, and to the commit­
tee, the lights blinked their warning, it 
was all over, and nothing to do until 
tomorrow.
‘AS YOU LIKE IT.’
The students of the night classes in 
the Electrical Equipment and Construc­
tion Department held a banquet and 
smoker Friday night, April 19th. It 
was given by the lower classes in honor 
of the graduating class, and was a com­
plete surprise to the latter. Messrs. R. 
L. Bacon, C. A. Fisher, Wm. Hartman 
and A. T. Pinches. About seventy-five 
were present.
The first part of the evening was 
spent in Assembly Hall, where the fol­
lowing program was presented:

Director Hamerschlag’s remarks were 
terse and forceful, but kindly, and served 
to make us feel as if we were well ac­
quainted with him. A few anecdotes 
from his own experience ought to fire 
us with ambition. He expressed regret 
that press of duties kept him from 
mingling more frequently with the stu­
dents, for which, I am sure, we, too, 
are all sorry. We wish he would come 
often to shop and class rooms.
He told us that the name of the 
Schools was to be changed to “Car­
negie Institute of Technology,” and also 
described the new seal and motto. This 
announcement of the changes mentioned, 
was, he said, the first made of them to 
any group of students.
Dean Connelley’s talk was also very 
personal, and while brief, was full of 
good advice and encouragement for the 
man who must work for a living while 
struggling for an education. He threw 
in some really good jokes and stories 
and handed some boquets to our in­
structors. Come again, Mr. Connelley!
The other addresses by Instructors 
Calderwood, Dodds and Weaver, and 
J. S. Fruit, an A classman, were enjoy­
able, but we haven’t space to report 
them, for we want to tell about the do­
ings in the Wiring Shop, to which we 
adjourned with a rush. Here the cater­
er had made a transformation. The 
big work tables were arranged 
in a hollow square and covered with 
white cloths, also with things good to 
eat. Colored lights were festooned from 
walls and roof and the old shop looked 
like a real banquet hall. All instructors 
on duty, were lassooed and dragged in, 
stuffed with sandwiches, pickles, cake 
and ice cream, presented with tobies and 
then held up for a song or a story.
The toastmaster then went after the 
boys, and discovered some real spielers 
in the ranks.
It was voted unanimously to make it a 
semi-annual affair, having onje in the 
Fall for the entering class, and one in 
the Spring for the graduates.
The success of this, the first smoker, 
was due to the efforts and system of the

ing and we hear Shakespeare from

street until we leave school in the

day evening there is a full rehearsal 
of “As You Like It” up in the gym­

part of “Rosalind,” is doing splen­
did work and we are sure that she, 
as the leading lady, will aid greatly 
in making the play a grand success. 
The rest of the players from the 
“Duke” down to the “Scenery” are 
putting themselves into the work 
with all their might and we confi­
dently expect the play of “As You 
Like It” to be one of the great events 
of “Commencement” week.* * *

6THE TARTAN
THE DISASTER OF THE 
TITANIC.
Senator McCumber made a speech 
in the House last Saturday, in which 
he said:
“Yesterday one man connected 
with the Titanic disaster was tried, 
convicted, sentenced, and executed 
here in the Senate of the United 
States, and as a Senator and a citi­
zen I desire to register my protest 
against the trial of any one connected 
with the running of the boat, with­
out fair, honest and full considera­
tion.
“The Lord knows that the habit of 
condemning public men without a 
hearing is bad enough, but it is not 
fraught with so much danger as our 
condemnation in a crisis when public 
feeling is wrought up and demands a 
victim. At such a time we certainly 
should suspend judgment.”
This speech refers to the censur­
ing of J. Bruce Ismay, Managing Di­
rector of the International Mercan­
tile Marine Co., by Senator Raynor 
the day before.
It is certain that further facts to 
be revealed at the continuation of J. 
Bruce Ismay’s hearing before the Sen­
ate Investigating Committee will go 
far towrard locating the responsibility 
for the disaster. The points to be 
cleared up are mainly as follows: The 
dangerous speed of the steamer at 
the time of the accident in the face 
of several warnings; the rumor that 
J. Bruce Ismay entered the third life­
boat, and thus violated the unwritten 
law of the sea; the failure of the 
North German Lloyd steamer “Frank­
furt” to respond to the Titanic’s call 
for help, and her interfering with 
messages exchanged later between the 
Titanic and the Carpathia; and the 
origin of the false reasuring mes­
sages sent out long after the Titanic 
went down.
The question of insufficient life 
boat accommodation is of no import­
ance as far as the location of respon­
sibility goes, for, the Titanic is an 
English vessel and she fully con­
formed with the requirements of the 
English law governing this contin­
gency. The disaster, however, shows 
that the English law does not provide 
sufficient safety for passengers, and 
it calls for American laws governing 
the equipment of vessels entering or 
clearing from American ports, re­
gardless of their nationality. In ad­
dition to this, an international agree­
ment governing the matter of life 
saving apparatus, to be drawn up by 
the Permanent Court of Arbitration 
at The Hague, will prove valuable in 
securing uniformity of regulations 
throughout the world.
---------------------_0-----------------------
TRIP TO WESTINGHOUSE.
Instead of the usual Machine De­
sign Lecture last week to the Junior 
Chemists, Minors, and Metallurgists, 
Prof. Follows accompanied them Fri­
day on an inspection trip to the West- 
inghouse Machine Co. at East Pitts­
burgh. The things of especial interest 
inspected were the new end-thrust 
bearing and the reducing gears now 
being tried out at that plant.
ENTRANCE SCHOLARSHIPS.
Conditions of Awardment.
Several months ago The Tartan pub­
lished an announcement of the foun­
dation of the Entrance Scholarships to 
each of the four schools. At that time 
the terms under which these scholar­
ships were to be given had not been 
determined by the faculties of the re­
spective schools. These requirements 
have now been settled upon and are 
given below in full.
Applications for Scholarships.
All applications must be made on 
special blanks provided for this pur­
pose, which may be secured from the 
Registrar.
Certain time limits are set for the 
filing of the applications, the dates be­
ing specified on the blanks.
Terms of the Scholarships.
Each Scholarship amounts to a cash 
stipend of $100.00, and free tuition, 
awarded for one year. The stipend is 
paid at the Bursar’s office on the fol­
lowing dates: fifty dollars on the regis­
tration date, and fifty dollars on the 
first of the following February.
Only those candidates can be consid­
ered for the Scholarships who are ap­
plicants for the regular day courses, 
and whose characters and capacities 
are such as to promise lives of useful­
ness and leadership.
The tenure of a Scholarship is con­
ditional upon the attendance, conduct 
and progress of the appointee being 
satisfactory.
On receipt of a scholarship assign­
ment the successful candidate is re­
quired to notify the Registrar within 
fourteen days of his acceptance of the 
award under the conditions prescribed. 
He shall furthermore present his let­
ter of award and register at the Regis­
trar’s Office on the registration date 
in September, as announced in the cat­
alogue. Failing to do this, the Scholar­
ship will be declared vacated, and will 
be awarded to the next qualified candi­
date.
After a student has been one or more 
years in residence, the Bureau for Stu­
dent Aid will extend him every assist­
ance possible should his withdrawal be 
threatened through lack of money. This 
assistance is rendered either by means 
of the Loan Fund, or by putting the 
student in touch with employment, both 
of which methods are fully described 
on pages 31-33 of the 1911-1912 cata­
log.
It is not expected that applications 
will be received from candidates who 
are financially able to take a Carnegie 
course without the aid afforded by a 
Scholarship.
Conditions of Award.
The basis on which the awards are 
made is competitive, and varies accord­
ing to the School into which the can­
didate seeks entrance. In every in­
stance, however, certain qualities of 
character are determining factors as 
well as scholarship ability.
School of Applied Science.
Scholarship candidates for admission 
will be required to report at this School 
©n the scheduled June dates and sub­
mit themselves to the three regular 
tests for admission to the day courses 
of the School of Applied Science, as
stated in the catalog, (1) the personal 
interview; (2) the certificate; (3) the 
entrance examinations. Such candi­
dates must present themselves in June, 
and not in September.
School of Applied Design.
Scholarship candidates for admission 
will be required to report at this School 
on the scheduled dates in either June 
or September and submit themselves 
to the following tests: (1) the per­
sonal interview; (2) examinations in 
Freehand Drawing and English.
School of Applied Industries.
Scholarship candidates for admission 
will be required to report at this School 
on the scheduled dates in either June 
or September and submit themselves 
to the following requirements: (1)
the personal interview; (2) present 
written testimonials from employers if 
the candidate has been at work, or 
present a principal’s statement if the 
candidate has been attending school ; 
(3) take such tests as may be given to 
determine mechanical aptitude.
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
for Women.
Scholarship candidates for admission 
will be required to report at this School 
on the scheduled June dates and sub­
mit themselves to the three regular 
tests for admission to the day courses 
of the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School, as stated in catalog: (1) the
personal interview; (2) the certificate; 
(3) the entrance examinations. Such 
candidates must present themselves in 
June, and not in September.

THE ALUMNI ISSUE.
Plans Under Way.
The Alumni Tartan Committee is 
getting its plans under way for the 
Alumni Issue of the The Tartan. The 
committee has mailed to each alumnus 
a letter, a copy of which is produced 
below. Should any member not re­
ceive his letter but see this notice, he 
is requested to mail any material he 
may have to Mr. McCorkle. The let­
ter is as follows:
April 2, 1912.
Dear Sir:
The Alumni Association of the 
Schools of Applied Science and De­
sign have adopted the Tartan as its 
official organ and have appointed a 
Tartan Committee. On or about May 
1st the Committee will edit an issue of 
the paper devoted entirely to the in­
terests of the Association. In order 
to make the issue a success, the Com­
mittee asks that every man reply 
promptly to the letter sent out and 
help all he can in furinshing news.
Have you ever stopped to think that 
The Tartan is the only paper which 
publishes up-to-date reliable news 
concerning Tech? If you want to 
keep informed of all current events 
at the School, read the Tartan. You 
probably have not heard from some 
of your class-mates for years. Here 
is your opportunity. This Alumni is­
sue will give you information that 
may be valuable to you. Among other 
news items this issue will contain an 
article on each of the following sub­
jects:
The New Buildings, The Degree 
Question, Athletic Organization, Camp
Carnegie, Student Activities, and nu­
merous other topics of interest to all 
Tech men. Information of this na­
ture should be foremost in your mind 
to be able to tell prospective students 
of the advantages of Tech.
Now, get busy, write a letter to the 
Alumni Tartan Committee, care of the 
Carnegie Technical Schools, telling

FULCRUM CLUB HEARS LEC­
TURE ON COST ACCOUNTING.
Last Thursday night, at a special 
meeeting of the Fulcrum Club, Mr. M. 
J. House, of the New York Cost and 
Accounting Co., gave a lecture on the 
importance of Overhead Charges in Cost 
Accounting. The speaker was introduced 
by the President. Special guests were 
the Chief of the Cost Keeping Depart­
ment of the Westinghouse E. and Mfg. 
Co., and three Plebes, who had respond­
ed to an invitation extended to them. 
Prof. George H. Follows was among 
the members present.
In his introduction, the speaker gave 
a comprehensive explanation of the func­
tions that a “system” should perform. 
System is as necessary for the cost 
accountant as for anybody else. The 
system of the cost specialist has to be 
analytical and synthetical both.
One of the chief functions of the cost 
system, according to the speaker, should 
be the reduction of wastes. Improper­
ly designed machinery not fitted for the 
purpose, are examples of such wastes 
frequently met with.
After a lengthy and purely technical 
discussion of the different methods used 
in applying Overhead Charges, the 
speaker devoted some time to the well- 
known Taylor system of increasing in­
dividual efficiency. Accurate times set 
for every operation, together with proper 
machine speeds, premiums, etc., have 
enabled some plants to increase their 
efficiency to 250 per cent of the original.
Toward the close of the lecture, some 
attention was given to the entire separa­
tion of the cost of production and the 
cost of selling. Two different articles 
may be manufactured at equal cost, and 
still the selling cost of one may be dou­
ble that of the other. If in this case 
no discrimination between the two fac­
tors were made, unfairness in the price 
of the articles would result. An example 
of this contingency is found in a plant 
manufacturing simultaneously standard 
and special cranes.
The lecture was thoroughly appre­
ciated and was followed by a hearty ap­
plause. The speaker remained for thir­
ty minutes to relate some personal ex­
periences, and the meeting adjourned 
at 10:30 o’clock.---------o---------

THE TARTAN7
MT. UNION SWAMPED.
Carts Wins With Heavy Hitting 
Team.
The Varsity easily defeated Mt. 
Union on last Saturday, April 20, by 
the one-sided score of 15 to 1. Carts 
played his own defensive game and 
allowed the men back of him few 
chances. These were handled in a 
creditable manner, and showed that 
the whole team can take care of all 
kinds of fielding opportunities. Carts 
established a new pitching record for 
the home diamond by striking out 
seventeen men in eight innings, and 
allowing but two hits, both single. 
The entire home team hit well and 
timely, and usually landed hard. Four 
new men were sent in at the begin­
ning of the sixth inning and all per­
formed well.
First Inning.
For Mt. Union, Zeiter, Lovall and 
Blythe went out in order by the 
strike-out route on twelve pitched 
balls.
Hamilton rolled an easy one to 
Pitcher Stevens and was thrown out 
at first. Vail drew a pass and swiped 
second, going to third on Blythe’s 
throw into middle. Mcllvaine’s foul 
fly was gathered in by Lovall, and 
Wehr fanned.
Second Inning.
Schmucker also fanned, making 
four in a row. Carson’s hot grounder 
was handled by Moorehead, and Umps 
called him out at first. Gibson swung 
wild three several times.
Moorehead tapped a grounder to 
Schmucker, who beat Bill to the bag. 
Hall tried for three bad ones and 
missed. Gearhart knocked a foul 
straight up, and Blythe couldn’t let 
it alone.
Third Inning.
McMurray lifted a high one to 
Gearhart, but Whinney and Stevens 
collected strikes.
Raisig, first up for the home team 
in the round, drew free transporta­
tion to Station 1. Carts smacked the 
sphere to Lovall, who threw wild to 
Schmucker, who in turn threw badly 
to catch Carts at second. Hamilton 
walked, filling the bases. Vail sent 
a fly to middle field, Carson gathering 
it in, but the latter was unable to 
keep Raisig from scoring, while the 
other two advanced one. Mcllvane 
went out, Stevens to Schmucker. 
Wehr hit to Zeiter, who dropped the. 
ball, and Carts scored, Hamilton fol­
lowing suit on the exchange of throws. 
Wehr stole second, before Moore­
head drew a pass. Hall made the 
third out on a fly to Carson in deep 
middle, and the score stood 4 to 0.
Fourth Inning.
Zeiter, Lovall, and Blythe followed 
their previous three part skit and 
fanned.
Gearhart started trouble by landing 
on the nose of an out curve for a 
two-bagger to left field. Raisig walk­
ed on four bad ones, one of which 
escaped the catcher and let Geary 
register at third. Raisig pujrloined 
second. While Carts was waiting 
them out, another bad one escaped 
Blythe, and Gearhart scored, Raisig
pausing at the three-quarter post. 
Carts collected four of a kind and 
passed. Gibson let Hamilton’s lawn- 
mower pass by unharmed, and 
Raisig tallied. Carts had stolen un­
seen to Bag No. 2 previously, went 
to third on the error, scoring on the 
throw to second, which caught Ham­
ilton. Vail went out, Gibson to 
Schmucker. Mcllvaine hit a two- 
bagger to middle, and Wehr was safe 
on a fumble of his hit to Carson. 
Mac easily beat the throw home and 
Wehr rested at second, then stole 
third, while Moorehead was fanning. 
Score, 7 to 0.
Fifth Inning.
Schmucker struck thrice in vain. 
Carson made a clean single to middle, 
but Mcllvaine saw that it was not 
stretched any. Carson stole a base, 
then Gibson hit to Moorehead, who 
fumbled and let the runner arrive 
safely. Gibson stole second. Wehr 
let one get away, and Carson scored 
the only run, while Gibson went to 
third; McMurray was given a walk 
and also stole second. Whinnery 
tried to bunt his third strike and was 
out, and Stevens fanned. One run.
Hall Hit safely and stole second. 
Stevens tried to catch him at third 
but threw wild and Hall scored. 
Gearhart hit a single, but was caught 
off the bag when he tried- to swipe 
second and slid. Raisig’s fly in front 
of the slate was gathered in by
Blythe. Carts struck out. Score 8 
to 1.
Sixth Inning.
Zeiter hit to Moorehead, who
touched the bag first. Lovall fanned 
for the third time. Blythe sent a fly 
to left field, and Vail made a fine
running catch of it.
Hamilton flied out to Carson. Vail 
hit a single back of short, then stole 
second. Mcllvaine was beaned, and 
retired from the game, Kesselman
replacing him. Wehr hit a double 
to center, scoring Captain Bucky and 
Kessie. Moorehead picked out one 
to his fancy and sent it to right for 
tw:o bases, scoring Wehr. Patterson, 
who had replaced Hall at third, 
fanned. Gearhart hit through short 
for a single, Moorehead scoring. 
Geary was caught trying to steal and 
thrown out by Blythe. Score 12 to 1.
Seventh Inning.
Schmucker hit to right for a safe­
ty, then swiped second. There he was 
left, for Carson, Gibson and McMur­
ray went down before the puzzling 
delivery af Carts.
Kauffman, Raisig’s successor, sin­
gled to middle field. Carts sent a fly 
to right that McMurray caught. Then 
Pete De Muth, who had replaced 
Hamilton, won his fame as the H.
I. Terror by slamming a triple into 
the wire fence, Kauffman scoring. 
Vail flied out to Carson, and Kessel­
man did likewise to Whinnery. Score 
13 to 1.
Eighth Inning.
Whinnery was safe when DeMuth 
missed his fly. Stevens flied out to 
Gearhart. Zeiter fanned, and Lovall 
went out Wehr to Moorhead.
Wehr singled and went to second 
when Moorhead hit safely to left. 
Patterson sacrificed Whinnery to
Schmucker, scoring Wehr. Gear­
hart flied out to Whinnery, and Moor­
head scored. Kauffman fanned. Score 
15 to 1.
Ninth Inning.
With Meyers in the box, Blythe 
went out, Kauffman to Moorhead. 
Schmucker flied to Patterson. Car­
son ended the struggle as it was be­
gun, by striking out.

A RETRACTION.
In our issue of March 21, we made 
some statements in regard to the 
Dual Meet with Westinghouse, which 
we at the time believed to be well- 
founded, but we have since been 
proved to be in error. The state­
ments referred to the 300-yard dash 
in which Crawford fell behind the 
screen in the Westinghouse gym­
nasium and our description of the 
race was understood by a number 
of readers to accuse the Westinghouse 
men of fouling our runner.
Mr. Erismann, of the Pittsburgh 
Playgrounds Association, was in­
spector of that part of the track, and 
has sent us a signed statement, which 
we attach herewith.
April 16, 1912.
The Tartan—
Dear Sirs:
In answer to your request for a 
statement regarding the incident dur­
ing the Westinghouse-Tech meet 
when Mr. Crawford fell, will say that 
I am positive no foul was committed.
Very truly yours,
A. J. ERISMANN.
We are glad to be able to publish 
this letter and hope that our former 
statement has caused no damage to 
the reputation of Westinghouse Club 
athletes, or to our relations with the 
club.---------o---------
Are YOU an honest-to-god Car­
negie man? Then help the good cause 
along by writing to the Councils, tell­
ing them how much we want that 
Morewood avenue bridge and why. 
DO IT NOW.---------o---------
FIRE IN FIELD HOUSE.
Much Smoke, But Little Damage.
A wireless operator working ten min­
utes overtime saved the survivors of the 
Titanic. Korbel saved the Gym. from 
! destruction by staying up half an hour 
| later than usual. This, of course, does 
! not mean that Korbel is a hero; he sim- 
I ply couldn’t help it. Some people get 
j fortune thrown at them, or run into it 
| blindfolded.
At midnight last Wednesday an en- 
I gine, a hose cart, and a ladder truck 
| awakened the people of Woodlawn ave­
nue, when they were seen to stop at the 
| Gymnasium, heads disappeared from 
! the windows and a large crowd, in bath- 
I robes and similar garments, was soon 
j in attendance. Some of the most agres- 
j sive found their way down the back 
j stairs and into the sub-basement, where 
I a dense cloud of smoke was surrounding 
Messrs. McCulloch, Ramsdell and oth­
ers, who were trying their best to find 
out what was burning, and incidentally 
to extinguish it. At the time it was 
discovered that the fire in the heater 
j had burned a hole in the floor, driving 
I the smoke into the sub-basement. No 
fire was seen, but the smoke didn’t stop 
coming. In the meantime, Korbel had 
had an opportunity to tell the question- 
I ers how he discovered the fire while 
sitting in his room. The burning wood 
I made considerable noise, and attracted 
j his attention. He then called the fire 
j department and summoned the necessary 
j help.
Here Kesselman entered upon the 
| scene. He had discovered that nothing 
j was burning in the sub-basement. The 
engine, the hose cart and the ladder 
j truck were therefore sent home and a 
fireman was ordered to cut a hole in the 
floor near the heater, to see whether 
anything was burning between floors. 
A square foot of the floor was soon re­
moved, and a jet of water played on the 
half burned wood for a short while.
Then everything was finished. Curi­
ous people retired to their respective 
quarters. The firemen went home. The 
Gym. was silent and quiet again. A 
disaster had been avoided.

specific purpose—to give YOU a day 
off in which to write that letter.

Eventually—Why not now.

8THE TARTAN
j “WHAT’S WHAT AND HOW.” j?
It may be authoritatively stated here 
that the Faculty baseball team will not 
commit its spring training at Hot 
Springs. Those who cannot secure 
quarters at an osteopathic sanitarium 
will cajole their aged bones and sinews 
with St. Jacob’s Oil, in secret conse­
cration to the call of duty.
Anyhow, the winter’s course of stair 
climbing, that our cherished janitors 
might not be anoyed by the presumptu­
ous use of their elevators, has kept 
professional muscles in serviceable con­
dition as well as their vocabulary of 
high voltage expressions.
It is rumored that some of the vet­
erans have declined to sign their con­
tracts, not from any sordid quibble over 
salaries, but because the management 
shows an Anthony Comstock disposi­
tion to frown upon the shedding of neck­
wear in the stress of conflict, somewhat 
offensively observing that the Faculty 
neck is not an unqualified thing of 
beauty, doubtless due to the fact that 
most of them were cloistered in this 
world-“renigging” occupation before the 
gentle art of “rubbering” was invented.
In order that this unfortunate com­
plication may not imperil the vital cere­
monies of commencement week, we 
suggest as a compromise that the Fac­
ulty uniform consist of peekaboo waist 
and divided skirt.
The rules committee for the ap­
proaching convulsion have so far pro­
duced the following pearls:
Fly paper will not be permitted in 
fielders’ gloves. Any player feeling an 
uncontrollable desire to throw to the 
home plate must give due notice of 
his intention, so that the spectators in 
the grand stand may take to cover. 
No player may score more than one 
run on a hit that faints before it passes 
the infield.
Any Senior making more than six 
errors will be required to tutor.
No degrees shall be granted unless
the Seniors make a fielding average 
of C and a batting average of the 
square root of C. Manifestly a failure 
in this respect would indicate a la­
mentable defect in their education.
Members of the Faculty team who are 
determined to slide are earnestly re­
quested to bring a bath robe as a re­
serve to cover their retreat, or any 
other portion of their anatomy that
may be ruinously involved.
The umpire, if he prefers, may roost 
in a tree outside the arena with opera 
glasses and a megaphone. He is here­
with empowered to swear in a posse 
comitatus if the exigencies seem to re­
quire it.
If a member of the Faculty team 
gets his hair (or what passes for his
hair) mussed, the game will be called
while he retires to the field house for 
physical and spirituous (we mean spir­
itual of course) consolation from Hun­
ter.
The logarithmic spiral curve is 
barred, but the sign curve “goes.”
It is a sweetly solemn sight to the 
non-combatants in the bleachers, that 
of their erstwhile scholastic umpires, 
tearing large ragged holes in the at­
mosphere with their riotous limbs, smit­
ing the earth vindictively with any por­
tion of their persons that is not other­
wise engaged at the time, and biting 
large chunks out of the macadamized 
atmosphere in an effort to replevin 
their breath.
Who could believe that these grave 
and reverend gentlemen could be so 
agile in evading “flies” and ground­
ers ; so almost clairvoyant in being 
where the ball is not and had no in­
tention of being.
And for a week afterward they turn 
over in their virtuous couches only by 
the assistance of levers and pulleys.
But then it must be done or the great 
cause of education would languish.

CARNEGIE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS : PITTSBURGH
T
^HE Carnegie Technical Schools consist of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied Science—Offers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied Design—Offers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied Industries—Offers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec­
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School—For women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be­
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night Courses—The four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.
