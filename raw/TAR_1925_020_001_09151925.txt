New Dean Well Known as 
Executive and

After much wondering and discus­
sion by various students, the truth is 
out. Arthur C. Jewett, engineer, edu­
cator, and authority on industrial edu­
cation, has been named as director of 
the College of Industries for the- coin­
ing year. .President Baker announced 
the appointment as a further step in

chanical Engineering.
Following his graduation from col­
lege, he was employed for two years 
as an engineering draftsman with the 
American Bridge Company. Then he 
accepted an appointment as instructor

years later became head of the De­
partment of Mechanical Engineering, 
holding that position for ten years.
ltelurning to industry, he joined 
Bird and Son, of East Walpple, Mass., 
as engineering manager in charge of 
all engineering, equipment, and man­
agement systems in five different 
plants. Two years later, he became 
associated with the Winchester Re­
peating Arms Company, serving from 
1916 to 1924 as production superin­
tendent of the cartridge department, 
employing 7,000 workers; superinten­
dent of personnel; and manager of 
inventories and budget control, after 
the cortipany’s absorption of the Sim­
mons Hardware Company.
In June of last year, Mr. Jewett 
joined the research staff of the Na­
tional Industrial Conference Board on 
the study of the relation of engineer­
ing education and industry.

According: to the registrar this
fall’s enrollment at Carneglo will be- 
a record one. Due to the fact that 
actual registration had not yet begun 
at the time of the writing of this ar­
ticle, no definite statistics can be 
quoted. But judging from the number 
of applications for admission to the 
college, there should bo between 750 
and S00 Freshmen entering Carnegie. 
However, since a number of these 
were applicants whose entrance de­
pended upon ilieir passing technical 
tests, the number of Freshmen who 
really registered would no doubt be 
considerably less than the. above fig­
ures.
A comparison of the probable 1925 
enrollment with’ the average enroll­
ment of the four previous yeaj-s shows 
an increase a^ follows; In 
lege of Fine Arts a 35 per 
crease; in Margaret Morr 
lege a 13 per cent increast 
the Colleges of Engineer in;

CHEERLEADERS READY
FOR COMING SEASON
With the football season looming up 
before us and a team that is shaping 
up even better than last year’s,, it be­
hooves us to say a few words in be­
half of our cheer leaders. They are 
in a great way responsible for the 
spirit of our school. It is they who 
must keep the traditional Carnegie 
spirit alive. In former years we have 
cheered though the odds were against 
us. It is up to them to instill within 
us even greater spirit as the fighting 
school in collegiate circles.
This y«ar we have Pete Seaman 
heading the cheering corps. Pete 
(alias Joseph Lane) Seaman is a mem­
ber of the Woodlawn Club, Druids, 
Tlieta Tau, Y. M. C. A. Cabinet and 
is also a member of the varsity relay 
team. He and Ills fellow cheer lead­
ers will stage several “pep” rallies 
before the opening game.
Dick Hawkes, a Pi Kappa Alpha 
man was elected business manager 
of the cheer leaders.
Hall is the Junior Assistant Cheer 
Leader and Mark Seibert and Phil 
Fisher are the Sophomore asssistants.
There are positions open for Fresh­
man Cheer Leaders. All Plebes who 
are interested please watch-.for the 
notice on the Bulletin Board.

Executive Board Urges 
Rushing Rules Change
Propose System of Deferred 
Rushing For Next Year
The camp for advanced students of 
the Engineering R. O. T. C. was held 
at Fort Huinphroys, Va., during six 
weeks of June and July. Both offi­
cers and students agree that this 
camp was tho most enjoyable and 
profitable of all held to date. Horse­
manship and pistol shooting were two 
of the subjects added this year, and 
both proved very interesting.
Carnegie carried off the honors nt 
camp, tho second platoon composed 
of 34 Carnegie, 1 Massachusetts In­
stitute of Technology and 6 Virginia 
Military Institute students winning 
most of the competitive ovonts. Some 
of the contests won by tho second 
platoon were volley ball, baseball, 
marksmanship, wall scaling, ono-milo 
relay, swimming and barrack inspec­
tion. Tho infantry drill and equita­
tion were won by other platoons. Tho 
students of Penn State composed tho 
first platoon, and tlioso from Johns 
Hopkins and Virginia Poly tech the 
third platoon.
Carneglo won first, second, third 
and sixth places in rifle marksman­
ship. Donald G. Dalton quallfiod as 
Expert Rlfioman, Lyle C. Ilughos'as 
Sharpshooter, and R. I. Winters and 
J. H. Hummer as Marksmen. Six­
teen other C. I. T. students also quali­
fied as :uarksmon. In pistol shooting 
D. G. Dalton, P. Johnor and J. W. Me- 
Orodle quallfiod as Pistol Sharpshoot­
ers. Nineteen other Carnogle stu­
dents quallfiod as Pistol Marksmen. 
The summary showod that 58.8 per 
cent of Carnoglo men qualified with 
the rlllo and 51 por cent' with the 
pistol.
Lyle C. Hugos, Donald G. Dalton 
and John II. Hummer yroro among tho 
ton Honor men soloctod for proficien­
cy, Interest, athletic ability and per­
sonal qualities. Penn State was tho 
only other collego having as many as 
throe honor men.
In tho athletic contosts Carneglo 
stood up woll, being second with 51 
points agtylmt 57 for V. P. I. and 30 
for Penn Stnto. Peck of Carneglo, 
was second In number of Individual 
points scoring 15 as comparod with 
16 for Lawson of V. I*. I. Amon of 
Carnogle, was third with 10 points.
Among tho interesting events of tho 
camp woro tho wookly hops, sight* 
soolng trips to Washington, Mount 
Vornon and other points of, historical 
Interest, and Inspection trips to tho 
District of Columbia water supply 
systom and other engineering works.

orate banquet.
Col. E. M. Markham, C. E., was 
Camp Commandor, and Major J. S.

the Englnoor Unit at Carnoglo, was 
Sub-Commander. Llout. J. W. More­
land, C. E., was instructor In chargo 
of tho 2nd Platoon and to him bolongs 
much of the credit for Carnoglo’a 
good showing and tho profltablo In­
struction that the students rocoivod.
Tho Executive Board, in an effort 
to minimize Freshman mortality, has 
recommended to the In ter fraternity 
Council the adoption of a number of 
changes in the existing rules govern­
ing the rushing of Freshmen by fra­
ternities.
The board, the membership of 
which is selected from the faculty, 
recommends the deferring of rushing 
until the Freshmen are firmly estab­
lished scholastically, at which time 
they will be less likely to succumb 
to the diverting influences of rush­
ing season and the initiation period.
The proposed changes will not be­
come effective until the term of 1926, 
and rushing this fall will be conduct­
ed under the present rules as set 
forth in the Carnegie handbook.'
The fraternity rushing regulations 
for the present term are as follows:
“Section 1. Rushing shall begin 
with a rushing period starting with 
the Fall Registration Day and termin­
ating at midnight of the third Satur­
day following. No bids shall be of­
fered during the first two weeks of 
this period.
"Section 2. Bids may be offered 
during the third week of the rushing 
pierlod 'begJnninK with mldnighjt of 
the second Saturday following rogls 
tration day. No Mds may bo accept­
ed during the th’rj. ,'cek of the rush­
ing period.
"Section 3. During the rushing 
period Freshmen must leave the fra­
ternity house by 9:00 any night pre­
ceding a school day.
"Section 4. Period of Silence: All 
rushing and bidding shall cease at 12 
o’clock midnight of the third Satur­
day and inutal silence shall be main­
tained until 12 o’clock noon of the 
following day (Sunday.)
"Section 5. Acceptance of Bids: 
At this hour (12 noon, Sunday), the

Surveying Camp Marked By Square 
Dances, Shooting Polaris and Pie
On the morning of July twenty-sec- 
ond, nineteen tanned and bright-eyed 
embryo civil engineers bade tlie town 
of Davis, W. Va., a fond farewell and 
took the trail to their places of legal 
residence. Summer surveying camp 
had come to an end.
Three weeks perviously they had 
enviously watched nine building con­
struction men depart for home. But 
now that they were leaving them­
selves, they admitted willingly that 
another week would not have been 
bitter medicine.
On June eleventh, twenty-eight 
donts and four faculty members had 
assembled at the Black water 'Hotel. 
For three weeks they worked and 
played together under the hot sun 
and blue skies of that nigged coun­
try. Then ten of thorn, Liontenunt 
I-Iomonway and tho building construc­
tion students, left. Life went on 
about as usual with tho smaller group, 
save that the baseball games failed 
to maken the oldrtime enthusiasm.
Davis was aa ideal location for the 
camp. Tho high altitude, invigorat­
ing atmosphere and cool breezes kepi
the boys feeling LlpLtop all the time. 
The rough, unfenced country, from 
which all lumber has been stripped, 
gave ample oporlunlty for the prac­
tice of all kinds of surveying work. 
The residents of the town were the 
most hospitable people Imaginable,

bigger and baUer, but keener than

will get their Puppets, and all first- 
year men and women as well are also 
urged to obtain the ‘'Dumb” number, 
after devouring this issue, it will be 
impossible to do without the succeed­

j CLAN NEWS |
Quito a fow replies havo been re­
ceived In response to the letter sent 
by the Alumni Offlco lo tho various 
clans requesting news concerning 
summer activities and plans for the 
fall. In fact, so many have been re­
ceived that It would bo almost im­
possible to publish all the letters 
verbatim, so that only extracts are 
given here.
NEW YORK CLAN
Plans aro now under way for a 
very active season for the New York

cessful one.
Beginning September 15th, the reg­
ular weekly stag-luncheons will be re­
sumed at Stewart's Restaurant Grill 
on Park Place, near the Woolworth 
Building. These luncheons were quite 
successful last season and tended to 
bring about a closer spirit of co-opera­
tion among the Clan members.
On Saturday evening, June 13th, 
Mr. and Mrs. Leo L. Burgess, Mr. and 
Mrs. J. M. Luter and S. A. Smith,

successful. It was a combined busi­
ness and social affair in the /form of a 
dinner dance at "Ye 1711 Club Inn,” 
Meriden, Conn.. which is midway be­
tween Now Haven and Hartford. The 
attendance was very good, and for the 
first parly of this kind gives promise 
of a successful season.
CLEVELAND CLAN
On Saturday afternoon, July 18, the 
Cleveland Clan was entertained at a 
picnic by the Painesville members at 
Palnesyille-on-tho-Lake. During thq

Clan officers attended, also tho old 
stand-by, Tilly, from tho Collogo who 
gave an address "Why bo a Lifer in 
Alumni Duos.” Tho past president, 
Paul Enimol, was absent but had a 
good reason: ho was moving his fam­
ily to tho shore for tho summer. In 
spito of tho warm weather many of 
tho Phily Carnegians were present 
and they did their "Collegiate” in 
Palm Beaches and summer dresses. 
The retiring officers wore very much 
pleased with tho past year due to the 
co-operation of the Phily-clan mem­
bers.

SCHENLEY THEATRE
Patrons of the. Schenley Theater 
are finding much to delight them there 
with the good program of motion pic­
tures and musical attractions which 
General Manager Harry Davis is ar­
ranging each weolc.
"The Teaser” is adaptod from the 
story of tho same name by Adelaide 
Mathews and Martha Stanley. The 
heroino of tho dashing story is Ann 
Barton, neglected scion of a wealthy 
family, who takes a position as cigar- 
counter girl in tho hotel in her home 
town. The plat, packed with lnimor, 
thrill and popular Intorost, dovolopB

Katherine Emerson of South Belle,

use of a bachelors unlimited credit. 
However, all does not run as smoothly 
as she had anl'ilpatod and the result

Pistol Shooting Operas and 
Sobbing Dramas
Mary Blair, former Carnegie stu­
dent and prominent member of the 
Princetown Players, wh'o succeeded 
Mary Morris in the role of the secre­
tive and sensuous Abbie Putman in 
"Desire Under the Elms" during its 
production in New York City, recom­
mends a radical procedure* as a cure 
for many of the evils of the modern 
drama.
According to the New York Herald- 
Tribune, Miss^ Blair advocates a revi­
val of the “Fatal Wedding." She de­
sires to see a return to the elemental 
and highly emotional type of drama 
that flourished In such profusion two 
decades ago.
Miss Blair, who studied dramatic 
art at Carnegie during 1917-1918, is 
one of the most successful of the 
women students of the department. 
She left school,to take a part in “The 
Little Lost Sister,” a stock production 
of that period. Recently she has be­
come the wife of the assistant stage 
editor of “Vanity Fair.” Success has 
constantly followed Miss Blair’s 
many ventures on the stage, and with 
her appearance as Abble Putnam an­
other triumph is registered for Car­
negie.
Miss Blair is not only an actress of 
note, but her occasional articles on 
theatrical subjects are considered 
quite autliorotative. Her writing
shows tlie obvious labor of sound 
judgment and much forethought.
Quoting from the Herald-Tribune:
“The pistol opera, as the shooting 
and .sobbing drama of the Grover 
Cleveland era have been tenderly 
called1, could be revived with both 
profit and pleasure,’' says Miss Blair. 
“In them we find stark emotion una­
dorned. They were not tricked out 
with sly philosophies of life, fugitive 
satire or double entendre. In them 
you saw life raw and vivid and emo­
tionally exaggerated, with villainy In 
the ascendancy up to 10:30 and right 
bursting forth brilliant and triumph­
ant at 10:50. The audiences employed 
their handkerchiefs and their hisses 
with* equal vigor, and a good time 
was had by all.
“I know whereof I speak, for I was 
hurdled from the classic Greek trage­
dies at the Carnegie Tech School of 
Acting in Pittsburgh to ‘The Little 
Lost Sister’ in the stock company 
around the corner, without rumpling a 
hair. Those were tlie days of gen­
uine applause. There was no ques­
tion as to how any actress or actor 
stood in the esteem of his auditors. 
‘The Little Lost Sister’ was what I 
like to call a three-handkerchlef play. 
Throe was the average number of 
lace-frlnged pieces Of linen used up 
by a regular attendant from Alleghany 
In a true appreciation of this tremend­
ous struggle between light and virtue 
on tho one side and hellish scheming 
and cruelty on the other. Each night 
the ,heroine was women desirous of 
offering their personal congratula­
tions on her eloventh-hour deliver­
ance from the snares of Iniquity.
“I speak of a revival of these plays 
In all sincerity. I do not mean that 
•they should be sot up with icasts cor­
responding to those employed in 
works like ‘The Little Lost Sister’ in 
its heyday, but with expert and under­
standing players in all the roles. 
They should! be played with 
gusto and sincerity, and f am confi­
dent that they would have just a-s 
great and deep an appeal today as 
they did twenty years ago. Theatrical 
taste moves in cycles and is highly 
sensitive to wind, weather, the tariff 
and foreign exchange. It is slowly 
but surely moving toward the emo­
tional melodrama, if 1 can judge its 
quirks.
‘I am duly appreciative of-my op­
portunity to play Abbie Putnam in 
O’Neill’s ‘Desire Under the Elms.’ 
Here, I am confident, is a role that 
will live in the American theater. 
The Theater Guild of fifty years hence 
will revive ‘Desire,’ our grandchildren 
will applaud it as a strong and real­
istic page from the best of American 
drama and' it will be incorporated in 
the textbooks as one of the finest 
tragedies ever ¡written ¡by an Amer­
ican.”
If there can be an Eugene O’Neill 
actress, Mary Blair is that actress. 
She created tlie role of the sex- 
starved Emma Crosby in “Dif'rent” 
and was the actress about whom 
swirled tlie storm, of puritanical pro­
test over “All God’s Chillun Got 
Wings.” Incidentally Miss Blair is 
one of three original women members 
of the Theater Guild, the two others 
being Helen Westley and Helen Free­
man.
New Plan Will Inform Alum n 
of Employment Conditions 
Throughout Country
Alumni Office is Formulating 
Plan to Enlarge Clans
In the final issue of last year’s Tar­
tan, there appeared an article in re­
gard to oil operations in Oklahoma 
fields. This article was sent in by the 
Tulsa Clan and gave a brief survey 
of employment conditions in this dis­
trict. The submitting of this survey 
gives rise to the suggestion of form­
ing a sort of organized employment 
service among the clans throughout 
the country, which would inform, 
alumni in one section of the possibility 
of Carnegie Grads obtaining employ­
ment in other sections.
There are a number of statistical 
organizations in the United States 
which periodically publish reports giv­
ing a summary of business and em­
ployment conditions. Th$se reports 
are of great value to those seeking 
employment or to those contemplat­
ing business ventures, and give the 
geographical location of the various 
industries.
The suggestion advanced above 
would have somewlfat the same end in 
view except that it would be intended 
exclusively foi the service of Carne­
gie Alumni. The procedure to be fol­
lowed would be of this general nature: 
An article prepared by one of the 
eastern clans will appear'in the Tar­
tan and a similar article from one of 
the western clans will appear the fol­
lowing. week. These articles will con­
tain a list of the industries and com­
panies in the district together with a 
general summary of positions availa­
ble and the possibility of employment. 
In subsequent issues, articles from 
other clans will appear. It can be 
seen that in this way, Carnegie grad­
uates will have reliable information in 
regard to openings in their professions 
in practically every part of the Unit­
ed 'States. If they desire to change 
their location, they will be able to 
obtain a fair idea of the possibility of 
employment 4n almost any district 
where they intend going.
At first thought, it may seem that 
the preparation of these articles will 
be rather troublesome. However, 
since the members of the different 
clans are undoubtedly in close touch 
with the various industries, a clan 
should not. have much difficulty in 
drawing up a survey which would be 
quite suitable. Since there are a 
fairly large number of clans, any cer­
tain one should not have to give more 
than two reports a year in order to 
have one in each issue of the Tartan.
The Alumni Editor will welcome 
any sugestions or comments in regard 
to this project.
The Alumni Office is now working 
on a plan to make the different Car­
negie Clans familiar with the names 
of all former Carnegie men and wo­
men in an effort to make the Clans 
all Inclusive. The Tartan will, each 
week, contain the names of all alumni 
residing in the various clan districts, 
so that the clan officers may round up 
the former Carnegians who have not 
become affiliated with the official 
alumni organizations.
Such an arrangement will be a 
splendid assistance to clan officers- 
who obviously cannot be in touch 
with the entire, ever-increasing body 
of alumni. With accurate knowledge 
of alumni living within their districts, 
the clans will have an excellent op­
portunity to increase their member­
ships, and to make all alumni clan- 
members.
The details of the plan have not 
been entirely worked out as yet, but 
they are sufficiently definite to give 
a general idea of its purpose. The list 
of alumni is to be compiled by the 
Alumni Office and will be published in 
sections so that a complete register 
of alumni in every part of the coun­
try will appear in the Tartan during 
the year. The list appearing in any 
one Tartan will probably include the- 
alumni of a particular district. It is 
requested that the clans will supple­
ment these lists wherever necessary 
in order to make them as comprehen­
sive as possible.
Another end in view is the' estab­
lishment of new clans. By having 
such a list of graduates available, it 
will be possible to determine the num­
ber of alumni in any parKoular sec­
tion. If there is not a clan in this 
section, it will , not be at all difficult 
to get in touch with the various grads 
and to arrange for meetings. It is 
hoped that this plan will give a de­
cided impetus to the formation of new 
clans.

TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1925THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE
- PLAID ATHLETICS -
FOOTBALL SQUAD 
IS IN GOOD SHAPE
TRAINING CAMP PERSONNEL
Steffen, Waddell, Marks and 
Anderson Making Good 
Progress With Men
As in previous years, the football 
training camp began September first; 
preliminary training ending last Sat­
urday, to the great relief of the men. 
The routine in itself was much the. 
same as last year, with the exception 
of rope jumping. During the summer 
the football candidates were instructed 
to jump rope at every opportunity, and 
if possible, get proficient enough to 
jump two thousand times without 
missing. Several of the boys can now 
swing the rope three times to one 
jump.
During the first week, calisthenics 
were emphasized, together with falling 
on the ball, tackling, etc. With the 
exception of Cooper’s shoulder, no 
serious injuries resulted.
A bit of scrimmaging and signal 
drill was added to the list during the 
second week and gradually given 
major importance towards the end of 
the training session.
All the men returned in excellent 
condition, many of them having had 
outdoor occupations during the sum­
mer months.
Most of the fighting for positions is 
now centered on the terminals and the 
half back berths. "Mike” Goodwin 
was tried at half for several days 
last week, and may remain there. 
Donohoe and Powrie are hard at work 
for an end position, together with 
Bielski. Bastian aided by Donohoe 
will likely do the panting this season. 
Max understudied Obie Newman last 
year and shows real talent at booting 
the ball. Cass, Kristof, Manby and 
Yoder are working hard to retain their 
former positions on the line.
The Coaches.
With all the publicity attending the 
football squads, there is little enough 
heard about the coaches. Just a 
word anent them.
Judge Steffen, the Chicago jurist, 
has cast aside his judicial robes for

the time, in order to become once 
again the "Wally” of the football 
team. Following the recently inaug­
urated custom, he will spend his vaca­
tion with the squad and thus be with 
them the entire month of September. 
For the rest of the football season he 
will be available every week-end, 
making a special trip from Chicago 
in each case. During the week the 
squad will be left to the tutelage of 
Bob Waddell, assisted by "Doc” 
Marks. This plan was followed with 
great success last year and should be 
equally as efficient this season. Per­
haps the great secret of its success 
is to be found in the respect and 
admiration that both Wally and Bob 
command with the boys. It is safe to 
say that no coach ever inspired his 
men to a greater degree than "the 
Judge,” and Bob surely showed his 
ability along the same line last year. 
Both have the whole-hearted backing 
of the student body as well as the 
football men.
Doctor William L. Marks, resident 
physician, as the catalog reads, is 
field coach and general assistant to 
the other two. For the past several 
seasons he has done his part in turn­
ing out capable players and is fully 
as much in the confidence of the boys 
as Wally.
The Plebes have Jim Henderson, 
former Carnegie star gridder, back at 
the holm, and are expected to come 
through this year under his watchful 
eyes. Jim is the youngest of the 
coaches and being a graduate of the 
Steffen system, understands it thor­
oughly.

RUSHING RULES CHANGE
(Continued From Page One.) 
senting himself at the house of tho 
quarters' of the fraternity of his 
choice. >
"Section 6. Open Rushing: From
this time on open rushing in regards 
to fall registrants shall prevail.
"Section 7. Men entering school at 
the beginning of the second semester 
shall not accept a bid until two weeks 
subsequent to that registration day 
have elapsed.
"Section 9. Publicity: (c) A non­
partisan person shall go before all 
Freshmen class meetings of the men’s 
schools during the rushing period 
and explain the rushing rules.”
The dates of the periods mentioned 
in the regulations listed above are 
Rushing period—Noon, September 
14, to midnight of Octobor 3.
Building period—Midnight, Septem­
ber 26, tp midnight of October 3.
Period of silence—Midnight, Octo­
ber 3, to noon of October 4.
Acceptance .of Bids—Noon of Octo­
ber 4.
The changes in the present regula­
tions advocated by tho Executive 
Board were adopted by that board at a 
meeting May 20. They were recom­
mended by a special committee of the 
board after a several months’ study 
by tho committee of the causes of 
Freshman mortality.
The proposed rules have been ap­
proved og by President Baker, as fol­
lows: In a letter bearing tho date
of June 3 to the Interfraternity Coun­
cil Doan Tarbell, secretary of tho 
board, stated the now regulations as 
follows:
"For 1925-2G the prosont practice of 
fraternities for rushing, pledging and 
initiating Freshmen can continuo.” 
"For 1926-27 Freshmen may be 
rushed, plodged and initiated only 
after the mid-semester examinations 
of the first semester, but may not 
live in the fraternities during the first 
semester.”
"In 1927-28 rushing, pledging and 
initiation inta fraternities will be 
postponed until aftor the nild-somea- 
ter examinations of tho second se­
mester. Freshmen pledged must bo 
in good scholastic standing, both at 
the end of tho first semester and at 
mid-semester of the flirst semester. 
iFrcshmen will not be permitted to 
live in fraternity houses during thoir 
Freshman year.”
"In connection with the foregoing 
requirements, it is to be understood 
that no attempt shall be made to or­
ganize Freshman societies.”
All Freshmen are urged to bear in 
mind that the above stated regula­
tions do not take effect until next 
year, and) that the “handbook” con­
tains all the regulations that apply to 
this term.
Poor scholastic standing has lost many more athletes to Carnegie 
sports than any other cause or combination of causes. As each 
spring and fall athletic season opens, there comes news of so-and-so 
being ineligible, not Infrequently one of the best members of the 
squad.
If a man has athletic talent and knows it, he should feel It his 
duty to do all that is in his power towards pushing Carnegie’s sports 
into the upper strata, of the college athletic world. The administra­
tion has, in keeping with the high scholastic standards of the In­
stitution, placed class-room work as an unavoidable pre-requislte 
to the daily signal practice, cross-country Jaunt, or what you wlik 
One might as well whistle up a tree as try to super-impose athletics 
upon scholarship.
It has been tried!
Get off to a good start tomorrow and keep up with the best of 
them.
FOOTBALL
The outlook for footuall this season is much brighter than that which 
faced the Plaid colors lasit year. The loss of Newman, Hable and Anderson 
is keenly felt, to be surej but good material is on hand to fill these imme­
diate gaps and a strong ¡first team will doubtless be tho outcomo. A light 
backfield and a moderately heavy line will face Thiol in tho opening game.
The schedule is as ljard as any Carnegie has had in recent years. As 
was the case last year, the Pitt game follows the W. & J. battle by a week. 
The Notre Dame and St; Louis games will give ample opportunity for the 
“bummers” and Fords of tho campus to display their respective mettle and 
metal.
Not much can be gathered about the prospective Plebe team until it 
is known how many of the men enter school. There are three candidates 
weighing over two hundred pounds on the squad and as a whole tlioy are 
the huskiest bunch of Pl'pbes that the school has' seen in several years.
HERE AND THERE
The first two of the season's football games will be plnyod in the Car­
negie Bowl and not at Forbes Field as planned. It is almost certain that the 
Pirates will do the entertaining during the early days of October on those grounds.

The rumor that the Mount St. Marys game was cancelled proved to be 
untrue. The Pittsburgh papers were corrected after a short conference be­
tween Mr. Overend and the vice president of St. Marys.* * *

Youngstown V. M. C. A. camp on Lake Erie last summer. The men actod as

Saturday at Forbes Field. Crawford did the half mile in 1:68 and 8*5 sec­
onds last summer. Much is expected from him during this coming cross­country season.

measured a base line and angles for

took observations of Polaris, and let 
none forget the mine traverse. No­
body disliked the work in the field. 
Notes and maps were not attacked 
with gusto, as a rule, but they took 
only a small proportion of the time.
Baseball, swimming, tennis and 
square dancing were the chief forms 
of physical recreation, with the last 
winning the honor of being called the 
most strenuous by several buckets of 
perspiration. It was the perform­
ances of those two doughty clubbers 
and polished infielders, Vierheller and 
Daniels, that inspired the boys to 
their best work on the diamond, with 
Dick Silverman and Halsey Jones 
punching the ball into the tali, tail

plate. Square dancing was the sport, 
however, that got the boys by the 
tonsils and never let go for an in­
stant. They even rehearsed during 
wet spells out on the railroad sur­
vey. With Otmar Elchenlaub as offi­
cial organizer they even gave a square 
dance of their own that seemed to 
have a corner on hilarity for the even­
ing.

Christoff and Bastian Receive 
Honors From Their 
Teammates
Two of last year’s athletic ton ms 
deferred tho naming of thoir 1926 
leaders until tho very last days of 
school, and as a natural result, little 
has beon heard of tho captains of 
baseball and trade for tho coming 
year. Tho baseball team decided oh 
Joe Christoff as 1926 captain, while 
Max Bastian was olected to lead the 
track squad next spring*. Both men 
also played on last year’s football 
team, in addition to starring in these 
two sports, thus becoming tho only 
three letter men in school.
Johnstown, Pa., claims Joo as a na­
tive son, and it was at high school 
there that his athletic activities first 
attracted attention. Coming up to 
Carnegie, he displayed considerable 
prowess in football on the Plebe 
team, and continuing with tho var 
sity squad was ablo to win a letter 
on lost year’s team. He also identified 
himself with tho track team very 
early, so that, last year ho was a. con­
sistent performer in tho dashes and 
easily acquired another letter. The 
1925 baseball team being the first at 
Carneglo for some time, Joe had but 
little experience in college baseball, 
but even so was able to win an out­
field berth, and acquitted1 himself well 
enough to bo nominated to lead this 
year’s squad.
He is a Senior in the Machine Pro­
duction course in Industries and has 
been active in non-athlotlc linos as 
well. He is a member of Druids, Del­
ta Skull and Dragons. In addition 
to holding class offices, Joo last year 
hold down tho job of Sports Editor 
of Tho Tartan and was plodged to Pi 
Delta Epsilon. Ho Is a member of PI 
ICappa Alpha fratorulty.
Max Bastian, ono of tho outstand­
ing stars of tho football team of last 
soason, sooms duo for an even botttor 
year on tho gridiron. IIo camo to 
Carnoglo from Lancastor, Pa., and 
has playod football oaoh year, with 
Increasing success duo to his spoody 
lmokfiold work. Thoro was still time 
left for track though, and horo ho 
for the javelin throw, besides captur 
lug t.ho broad Jump' In sovoral moots. 
His consistency In those two ovonts 
led hi« mates to make him captain 
for tho coming yoar. Just as a sldo- 
IsHiio ho also mado last year’s base­
ball team.
Max Is a moinber of Beta Thota PI 
fraternity and Druids, Sophomoro

A NEW LEAF
“Hail, liuil, the gang's all liere!” arid with a 
round of welcomes, a round oJ! cheers, and. a flour­
ish of eliivalrie greetings, we take up the torch 
again! in this first burst of enthusiasm at the 
meeting of! old f riends and the greeting ol! new 
ones wo live entirely in the present, forgetting to­
morrow and the tomorrows that aro to follow it, 
forgetting past failures and past successes that 
were, to a great extent, the result of our worlc 
during the foundation weeks of the new year. 
We would do well to settle quickly into the 
work of running Carnegie successfully.
In the first place, Carnegie’s name is made. 
Many, no doubt all of us, noted the new attitude 
of attention which greeted the mention of Car­
negie Tech. Apparently it is the result chiefly of 
our athletic and scholastic prowess. No matter 
what its source, our best efforts will be none 
too good to uphold the reputation we have made. 
This is the key year. Success in air our under­
takings will keep us in the ascendency for all 
time, and an early start will assure this success.
We face a year of radical change, as every 
year in the life of Carnegie has been a year of 
radical change. Our school is a pioneer in the 
field of applied science, which necessitates a great 
amount of experimentation at the expense of the 
student body, and tends to produce an excessive 
amount of friction with the administration. A 
quick adjustment to these changes and a rapid 
assimilation of the new elements appearing 011 
the campus will, reduce the disturbance of our 
normal social, lil'e to a minimum, and treble the 
visible results of our endeavors.
The new leaf is turned. The white, unsullied 
record sheet lies waiting on our desk, the year of 
greatest accomplishment lies before us.
IN DEFENSE OF PLEBE REGULATIONS
Plebe regulations—the subject of a thousand 
platitudes and invectives. As readily disregard­
ed as the Volstead act and as good intentioned. 
Why do we have them?
Year by year this question echoes through-the 
class rooms and is never settled. They are toler­
ated—the course of the least resistance—handed 
down by forebears who copied them from older 
institutions. Can their existence be justified?
The college freshman arrives at an impression­
able age. Has he not completed high school.—as 
achievement in itself? And now he is one of the 
privileged few to enter college. Ho is little less 
than an inferior dicky in his own colored imagin­
ation.
Many .of the friends with whom he toiled or 
Voafecl through high school have gone to work— 
hard work, wearying work, perhaps soft jobs— 
and soon thoir insignificance as mere human atoms 
gains hold on their consciences. They accept 
work, not as a temporal and repugnant moans to 
am end, but its the end itself, inescapable and 
quite compatible with cxistoncc.
But the college, applicant has four years in 
which to develop his ego. L<\)ur years ol! com­
pounded individualism. The sudden, realization
Of life can shatter him, a temporary easuality at 
least. -
So Plebe regulations are inflicted upon him. He 
is brought to realize his unimportance, he is 
thrown together with others similarly downtrod­
den and gains a truer insight of his responsibility 
to himself and others. Regulations level off 'the 
individuals and the Plebe year becomes the scari­
fying crucible.
Men of all types come...rich and poor, blatant
and retiring; all go into the furnace together. 
They mix, the dross rises and is swept away. And 
tile pure refined metal is drawn off to be cast 
and hammered into a thousand shapes.
True, the resultant metal is uniform, without 
identity, of marked personalities there are few. 
But it is tough, resilient and pure. It bends be­
fore life but does not break for it has the power 
of recovery within itself.
Plebe regulations bring the first realization of 
the true demands of fellow men, the interlacing 
and interdependence of society, and the void 
which awaits him who stands apart.
And they are tolerant, kind and sympathetic, 
which life is NOT.
FOR THE PLEBES
Dangerous days are ahead for a certain ele­
ment of the student body. In spite of the first ex­
hilarating taste of Carnegie tradition, our Plebes 
little realize what is really in store for.them, and 
a hint or two may save several sighs.
Plebes, the sophomores think you look remark­
ably handsome in dink and black, and men of 
your type should carry as credentials registration 
cards and Plebe Bible. Then, to attain to the 
state of Man-of-the-Worldliness into which you 
are entering, a box of matches and an air of utter 
disdain toward the lowly co-eds is essential.
But the above are mere physical instructions, 
for which you will be meted a physical reward. 
There are'ethical and social duties to, which are 
a basic part of your education as loyal Car- 
negians, and for which the reward is good-fellow­
ship and fond memories. Make the Carnegie 
songs, the Carnegie yells, the Carnegie traditions, 
and the Carnegie enthusiasm an integral part of 
your life. I-tcmcmber the rooms, the entrances, 
and the privileges that are denied you, and feel 
that in doing this you are adding your bit to the 
strength of our union.
Learn the standard rules of eligibility, keep 
ever in mind the punishment for cribbing and all 
similar action of a dishonorable nature, remember 
that class attendance is of utmost importance, es­
pecially to first year men, -who have not yet 
proved themselves capable of maintaining our 
high scholastic standard. Show the proper defer­
ence to upper classmen and instructors. Infrac­
tion of this rule will bring many of you to grief 
despite oft-repeated warnings.
The Plebe Bible and the White Book are your 
guides. In justice to yourselves, obey them to the 
best of your ability.

HUGHES WILL REPRESENT

being one of the two engineer repre­
sentativos 011 the Third Corps Area R. 
O. 'I’. C. Rifle Team at Camp Perry. 
Ohio. Last year Carnegie was rep­
resented by Asbury Wilson.
Preliminary tryjouts are in progross 
to dblurmlno the (Inal coniposition 
of tho match team of ten men. 
Latest reports show Hughes holding 
second place. Hughes writes that he 
,is having a most interesting ami in­
structive time is getting quite a kick 
out of the experience, including a 
kick 011 the jaw for which Ills rifle 
is responsible.
The matches began August 23 and 
will end u:bout September 20.
Returning to college after 
mer’s vacation implies to some, hard 
labor and a monotonous round of 
classes. To others, it offers the won­
derful opportunity to learn and to 
take advantage of .facilities for study 
of which so1 many are deprived. But 
to all of us conies the keen joy of 
meeting old classmates and friends 
who have survived the onslaught of 
F’s anr R’s which at times seemed 
about to overwhelm us.
.It is a singular fact that our friends 
at Carnegie are bound to us more 
closely than ordinary acquaintances 
because-we are all working toward a 
xiommon end: the spreading of the 
famo of “Dear Old Carnegie.” Not 
only does tills apply to tho undergrads 
but to the alumni as well. It is to 
the alumni whom wo look for tho 
carrying-on of the ideals instilled all 
school and for the accomplishment of 
"big things" which will firmly estab­
lish the name or Carnegie as a school. 
We lire proud of the attainments of 
our grads and wish them tho best of 
success.
But there is something that alumni
sum- are apt to forget upon becoming in­
volved in business and professional 
life. This is, that their school still 
needs them. "Alumni, keep in touch 
with your Alma Mater.” Students are 
interested in what the alumni and 
clans are doing. They are pleased to 
hear of tlieir attainments and there is 
no better medium of communication 
than the Alumni Page of the Tartan.

The Week 
in the 
World’s News
With this i3sue the columnist 
starts his second year of trying to 
give a fairly critical view of the world 
events. The beginning a year ago 
was fraught with much scepticism for 
the general concensus of opinion wa3 
that no student would ever read any­
thing that smacked of studies or 
world matters. The greater part of 
the editorial staff even looked askance. 
But with the gradual development of 
the column, both in length and quali­
ty, it was found that enough people 
were reading it to make it quite worth 
while giving space to news. We are 
not trying to claim any glory for 
I these changes, for we believe that any 
such material in a presentable form 
would be read. The student after all 
can be interested if time and seme 
degree of understanding are given to 
lit.
We have two aims in the prapara- 
tion of these articles, the first to put 
them in such a presentable form that 
not only will they be read but that 
interest enough will be created to get 
the students to read regularly some 
daily paper. The other aim dealB 
with an attempt to give an economic 
and social interpretation to all news. 
Gradually, so much so that we have 
hardly realized it, the Government and 
the political parties have made de­
cisions that should have been purely 
economically and not political. The 
tariff for example, whether high or 
low, should depend upon the laws of 
trade and never on the passing whims 
of any party that happens to be in 
power.
Thus then we are aiming at the 
stimulation of interest in world news 
and in the attempt at giving the stu­
dents as sane an economic and social 
point of view as possible. We would 
welcome any suggestions or helpful 
criticisms from our readers.

FOOD
This man is dead.
Everything he shall say
Is now quite definitely said.
He was only a poor Plebe.
How could he kuow what was in 
store for him.
Ho tried to lunch at the Grill
But found a mob there, grim
And lighting mail,
Chaflag impatiently at. their places In 
a long slow moving lino. ’
Ho loft sail
And wont upstairs to dine.
But .tho Maggie Murphs Intoroeptod 
him
And ¡oil only mayonnaise.
Despairingly lie rushed to the Com­
mons
But the help was eating and paid him 
no attention.
Hunger ripped at his vitals and in a 
daze
Ho dragged himself to the Skibo.
“Gimme a hamburgher!” he cried.
Wliut more need be said?
I He was only a Plobe 
i And he is dead.
UNRECORDED PROGRESS
| Real improvement has been made 
| in the tennis courts this summer. 
! Hazards—water holes and gravel pits
The men’s infirmary, which is lo­
cated in the basement of McGill Hall 
is now practically completed and is 
ready for occupancy.
This infirmary, which will accom­
modate seven 01* eight men, contains 
four bedrooms and- a sitting room. 
These rooms are simply but tastefully 
furnished. Dainty curtains at the win­
dows and flowers in eaicli room impart 
a touch of color and give a home-like 
j appearance to the whole.
It is interesting to know that the 
present infirmary has become a tiling 
of reality through the efforts of the 
men, and through their co-operation 
I with the staff. Up to about two years 
I ago, sick men in the dormitories 
I cared for themselves as best they 
I icould. But about tills time the men 
j assessed themselves fifty cents 
I a p'loeo, in order to establish a fund 
j which would provide for the proper 
kind of food bo lug served to sick 
moil. Last your tho men assessed 
thomsolvos 0110 dollar oacli for tills 
( purpose, aud a iow rooms wore sei. 
apart in Boss Hull, whoro sick men 
could be cared for.
By request of the men themselves,
| an assessment of one dollar Is to be 
i placed 011 each man’s dormitory card 
this year, in order to establish a 
| fund for the maintenance of the in­
firmary. This infirmary has been 
| equipped by the men themselves, who 
are very proud of it.
Miss Helm, who is in charge of the 
men’s dormitory, is greatly pleased 
with the co-operation which the men 
I have given her in establishing the iu- 
; firmary, and also in planting the flow- 
j er gardens which add so greatly to 
j the general appearance of the 'dormi- 
! lories.
