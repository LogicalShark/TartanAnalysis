TARTAN BACKS PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE
Sunderland, Oakland’s 
”Dark-Horse” Aspirant, 
Is Sure of 1940 Win
George B. Sunderland, Oakland’s native son, lias been 
wholeheartedly endorsed'by the Carnegie TARTAN in his cam­
paign for President, of the United States on the American 
Golden Rule Party ticket. As far as is known, the TARTAN is 
the first prominent newspaper to take such action. Other en­
dorsements are expected as the campaign gets under way.
The members of the Oakland police force have joined the 
Sunderland For President drive. They have pursuaded him to 
establish temporary headquarters in the fourth precinct station 
house.
Mr. Sunderland believes that his life has been, in constant 
danger since he' agreed to submit to popular insistence that he 
enter public life. lie suspects that the F. B. I. agents and the 
police realize his potentialities and that he is being constantly 
guarded by them. At present he is living at the home of a 
wealthy man, but his address is being kept secret to thwart any 
attempts at assassination.
Mr. Sunderland is no longer a young man, but his ideas are

Tuition Fee Increase 
Is Announced; Becomes 
Effective Sept. 13,1940
Despite Raise, Fees Are Lower
Tliau in Other Technical Colleges
Announcement of increases in tuition fees, made necessary by a 
decline in income from endowment funds, has been made by the Car­
negie Institute of Technology.
The new chai'ges will go into effect for all students beginning 
with the first semester of the 1940-41 session, which opens September 
13, 1940.
Carnegie Tech has been able to postpone the increase in fees 
longer than many endowed institutions. Even with the increase next 
year the new lees will be lower than those of many privately-sup­
ported institutions of similar char- ?, 
acter.
Kern Resigns
Bill Kern officially tendered 
his resignation as Head Coach 
of the Carnegie Football team 
at 5:10 last night. To complete 
the prediction of the TARTAN 
Sports Editor, made two months 
ago, Mr. Ivern will probably go 
to West Virginia.
Appointed Trustee
Sunderland (center) Pictured in Tartan Office 
startling arid refreshing. He graduated from the University of 
Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy in 1899. It was there that he 
became famous as a dropkicker, playing on the same team with 
Buddy Overend’s father. His ability as a player was a never- 
ceasing cause for wonder. He made touchdowns with ease. He 
starred, however, as a kicker. He was so expert that he never 
bothered to remove his overcoat when kicking, and demon­
strated-his "ability, and agility, by kicking with both feet.
Emphasizing his opposition to politicians, Mr. Sunderland. 
• said, “I am an average man, a practical business man. I have I 
never been in politics but I would like to study political 
economy. I am internationally famous in pharmaceutical chem­
istry. I’m so sensible and broad-minded that-!¦ might even let 
J. Edgar Hoover stay in when I am elected.”
Running Mate Is Well Known
Running for vice-president on the American Golden Rule 
Party is an internationally well-known figure. Mr. Sunderland J 
does not wish to divulge his name prematurely because other ( 
parties might snatch him up. (With regard to this,.Mr. Sunder­
land reminded the TARTAN that Dewey has not yet named 
his runnirig-mate.) He estimated “that-my colleague will swing 
St least one-lialf of the votes in the United States for the 
•ticket.”
“The campaign is taking hold well,” the presidential can-, 
didate said confidentially. “I am extremely popular and well-' 
liked in Oakland. I know a man in Detroit who is ready to j 
start a Sunderland For President Club of Michigan the moment I 
I say the word. The barber knows a doctor who is going to j 
Boston shortly. I’ve got to see him about starting.a drive there, j 
There will b^ at least forty states in the Sunderland column, j 
The country has been waiting for something like this for a long j 
time. My platform has no splinters in it and the edges are i 
beveled. Remember the slogan: ‘Bring America Back to Its 
Place in the Sun with Sunderland.’
“I recentty made'a eoast-to-eoast trip, roughing it all the 
way, and found the dissatisfaction with the present administra- ‘ 
tion widespread. While talking to some friends in the Oakland 
diner, I simply hinted at a dark horse third party candidate. 
They didn’t know I was talking about myself, but they were 
very enthusiastic.” ,
Mr. Sunderland has additional reasons for being optimistic. 
He pointed out that Pennsylvania has had only one president, 
James Buchanan; Oakland and Pittsburgh, none, so that the 
law of averages favors him.- Then too, the first name of the 
first president of the United States was also George. It is of 
no little significance that many affectionately call him “Lin­
coln” because of his physical resemblance to that great 
American.
Like all great men, Mr. Sunderland has been tempted from 
the path of public service by offers of handsome bribes. He 
was offered $75,000 to put John L. Lewis in as Secretary of 
Labor, which he of course scornfully refused. He has arranged 
to see the president of a local bank for financial backing.

Tomorrow in Little Theater
Lower Depths,” a drama of degradation, by Maxim Gorki 
G opens tomorroAV night in the Theater of the College of Fine Arts 
, and will continue through Jan. 17.
Starting with this new show a new policy will be put into 
effect by the Department. Instead of alternating casts as has 
formerly been done, one cast will perform every night from 
Wednesday through Friday and onther cast will perform from 
Saturday through Wednesday.
The characters are. members of a band of thieves who live 
;in a cellar in a big city in Russia. The plot centers around 
Wassillissa’s attempt to get rid of her husband, Kostilioff, for 
loS’e of Pepel. Pepel, however, is in love with a younger, more 
attractive girl, Masha.
In other endowed technical col­
leges, annual charges for tuition 
alone range from $400 to $600.
The basic tuution fee of $300.00 
for full-time students in the day 
school, which has remained con­
stant since 1927, has been increas­
ed $30.00 per semester. Minor ad­
justments have been made in the 
general fee. Under the new 
schedule of charges regular day 
students in the College of En­
gineering will have an increase of 
$30.00 per semester; in the Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie College, 
$25.00 per semester; in the Car­
negie Library School, $30.00 per 
semester; and in the College of 
Fine Arts, $35.00 per semester, 
except in the Department of 
Music where the elimination of 
the charge for individual lessons 
results in a net increase oC ap­
proximately $15.00 per semester 
in the amount the average student 
will pay.
Part Time Fees Increased 
For part-time students (those 
pursuing a schedule of 21 units or 
less) in the day school pro­
portionate increases have been 
made. Students in this classifica­
tion in the College of Engineering 
will pay $10.00 more per semester; 
in the Margaret Morrison Car­
negie College, $9.50 more per se-, 
mester; and in the College of Fine 
Arts, $12.00 more per semester.
The basic tuition in the even­
ing and summer session courses 
will be increased from $3.00 to 
$3.60 per unit per semester. A 
general fee of $6.00 per year will 
be charged to all evening stu­
dents.
Along with the change in fees 
the Institute announces an in­
crease in the scholarship budget.

An Unseen Admirer 
Leaves It to C.I.T.
Among Carnegie’s many un­
seen and unheard admirers was a 
Miss Ella Law of Erie, Pennsyl­
vania. The Carnegie Magazine 
quotes Miss Law as a firm be­
liever that “Carnegie Tech was 
a creation that was destined to 
add the happiness of success to 
thousands of lives thrpugh the 
dissemination of synthetic knowl­
edge in education.” So highly did 
she regard Carnegie that when 
she died, the residue of her estate, 
valued at $10,000, was willed to 
the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology.
By her act of generosity Miss 
Law went beyond the mere value 
of money to. set an example to 
others who feel as she did to­
ward education as a whole and 
Carnegie in particular. Accord­
ing to the Carnegie Magazine this 
act is a power for good that 
through faith is going to bring to 
Carnegie the full measure of its 
required $4,000,000 by 1946 in or­
der that it may receive from the 
Carnegie Corporation of New 
York $8,000,000 at that time.

CIT Chapter 
Of Sigm a Nu 
To Be Revived
Faculty Members 
To Act as Sponsors
In an effort to revive the Car­
negie chapter of Sigma Nu, which 
was active on campus from 1916 
to 1937, a group of students have ! 
organized a new club on campus, j 
It has been named Delta Sigma, ( 
which was the name of the orig- ' 
inal Carnegie chapter of Sigma 
j Nu.
I Plans for the revival of the fra- 
; ternity on campus were originated 
I by some transfer students who 
| had joined Sigma Nu at other 
ed seniors', the Bureau of Recom- 1 schools. At present Delta Sigma 
mendations is maintaining a iile ; has twenty-one members. Two of 
of Information on fellowships and these are seniors, (both transfers) 
scholarships. Various technical! and most of the others are fresh­
men and juniors.
Club Recognized 
The club has already applied 
for recognition at Carnegie and 
has received the unanimous ap­
proval of Interfraternity Council. 
The revival of the chapter has 
also been approved by (1) all 
members of the alumni chapter 
of Sigma Nu in the Pittsburgh 
area, (2) all the alumni of the 
former Delta Sigma chapter of 
Sigma Nu, (3) the High Council 
of: the Grand Chapter of Sigma 
Nu, and (4) the District Inspector 
of Sigma Nu and the members of 
the Carnegie faculty who belong 
to the fraternity.
However active revival of Sig­
ma Nu on campus must await ad­
ministration approval.
Official approval from Interfra­
ternity Council was received on 
December 15, 1939 and the High 
Council of Sigma Nu followed 
with its approval two days later. 
Faculty Sponsors 
Three members of the Carnegie 
faculty are acting as sponsors for 
the group. They are Prof. Kobt; 
A. Wallace, Dr. John H. Neelley, 
and Prof. Douglas McLean.
Richard Grim ’40, has been 
elected Commander of the group. 
Other officers are Tom Read ’40— 
Lieutenant Commander, John 
Taylor ’41—Recorder, and Michael

is “The Armor of God.” He says 
that this armor is a “defensive and 
offensive armor which man puts 
on to avoid the difficulties in the 
world.”
When he entered. Carnegie, Mr. 
Harris had already made up his 
mind to follow his engineering 
training with the study of theolo­
gy. While a student, he was Ad­
jutant in the R.O.T.C. Unit, and 
his activities of the campus also 
included membership in the Glee 
Club, drama crtic for the Tartan, 
member of the Thistle and Pup­
pet staffs, and chairman of the

the Lands.”
Class Formed 
To Aid Seniors 
Seeking Jobs
Mr. J. D. Beatty Will 
Organize Program
Seniors who expect to graduate 
in June, 1940, are urged to at­
tend three employment meetings 
which are to be held in Room 
104 Industries Hall, at 4:30 P. M., 
on Monday, Tuesday, and Wed­
nesday, January 15, 16, and 17.
Mr. John D. Beatty, Head of 
the Bureau of Recommendations, 
will conduct the meetings. He 
will lead a discussion of personnel 
and various problems confronting 
seniors expecting to seek employ­
ment after graduation.
Already, a number of June 
graduates have approached the 
employment office with numerous 
questions relative to employment 
applications, how to interview an 
employer, and other questions. 
These problems involve a new 
phase of economic life which 
should be approached with as 
much preparation as given to 
professional training.

Will Work 
On Hospital
After thirty-five years of ser­
vice Professor Charles C. Leeds is 
retiring from the faculty of the 
Department of Management En­
gineering at the end of the pres­
ent semester.
Professor Leeds was the seventh 
man to be appointed to the faculty 
when the school was founded. He 
says that seven has always been 
his lucky number. His first po­
sition was that of head of the- 
Department of Drawing in the 
School of Apprentices and Jour­
neymen, which later became the 
College of Industries.
Before . he came to Carnegie, 
Professor Leeds was with the en­
gineering department at Westing- 
house Electric and Manufacturing 
Company, where he had been 
teaching in the Westinghouse 
Technical night school and work­
ing as a machine designer during 
the day. Before coming to Car­
negie he had spent eighteen years 
In industry as a machinist ap­
prentice, a machinist, a drafts­
man, and a designer.
Professor Leeds began teaching 
at Carnegie when the school was 
still unfinished. He relates that 
the professors and students at this 
| time became quite adept at dodg- 
> irijg scaffolding and workmen. Dur­
ing his first class period he says 
that he was extremely nervous un­
til he found that his pupils were 
| just as jittery and after that they 
got along famously together.
Prof. Leeds plans to maintain 
his Pittsburgh home but will spend 
much of his time at his summer 
home in Old Forge, N. Y.
Although he is retiring from 
school he has already picked out 
a life-time job for himself after

Popular Anti-IKusso Feeling 
Dangerous to U. S. Peace
RCHESTRAS give stirring performances 
oil “Finlandia;” lecturers talk 011 “Friend­
ly Finland;” collections are being made to 
lielp “-waj-torn” Finland; the American press 
is united'" in its condemnation of the Russian 
invastkm, and story after story tells of Little 
Red Riding Hood beating off the Big Bad 
Wolf. The result of all this activity is that 
.American sympathy is becoming even more 
w. welded to the Allied cause, which Finland— 
p as her post-war history proves—represents. 
Another result is that the United States, a 
capitalistic country, is finding even more rea­
son to hate and frustrate Communistic, and 
other proletarian movements.
We can reasonably assume that the invasion 
of Finland has not changed American hopes 
of remaining out of war. Then why should 
we so blandly digest the biased stories printed 
in our newspapers, so obviously intended^ to 
discredit every movement of the Soviet Union? 
Bismarck said, “Many a nation has gone to 
war to repair the windows broken by its 
bellicose press. Nc He spoke the truth. Amer­
ican history bears out his statement', for since 
the birth of our nation the United States has 
fought either directly or indirectly in every 
European war, and in the last two especially 
' was the press responsible for popular ap- 
- proval of American entry. We are certainly 
not condoning the Russian, 01* any, invasion. 
But, even if Russia is entirely wrong and Fin­
land entirely right, there is still 110 justifica­
tion for some of the attempts to build up 
American sympathy for one side, and Amer­
ican hate for the other. But how can we even 
tell whether Russia is right' or wrong when 
our correspondents, and their sympathies, sit 
in Helsinki. The following paragraph is a 
precis of Russian claims, taken from a recently 
issued, and widely distributed pamphlet. Might 
they be true?
Russia’s claims, which have not been fairly 
presented, state that the Soviet Union invaded 
Finland to protect itself against the growing 
anti-communistic line-up of democracies, and 
state that Finland would have been the logical 
point of attack against her. Russia asked for 
certain reasonable guarantees of a good neigh­
bor policy—which Finland refused, presum­
ably 011 advice from England and France. 
When we consider that Finland was originally 
:a part of Russia, and was given her freedom 
-voluntarily by Lenin after the revolution in 
•order to set up a workers’ state, and that 
the workers’ state was destroyed by Manner- 
iieim who led German troops against the re­
public, killing 20,000-30,000 people, and that 
Mannerheim was backed by money and sup­
plies from Britain, France and the United 
States—we can see the beginnings of justifi­
cation for Russian fears, England and France 
ignored Litvinov’s recent attempts to form a 
united front against German expansion, but 
signed the Munich pact which gave Germany 
Czechoslovakia and showed their preference 
for German friendship as against Russian. An 
investigation of the “Balance of Power” tac­
tics of England, France and Germany will 
also show what utter lack of conscience and 
sincerity has marked their poltical maneuver- 
ings throughout history.
A recent streamer headline in the New York 
World Telegram, typical of American news­
paper treatment, s'aid: “30,000 Russians Kill­
ed.” Reading through obscure lead para­
graphs one found that during the entire war
30.000 Russians have been killed. A small ar­
ticle 011 the bottom of the paper said that 
“Scandinavian sources, estimate from 5,000 to
15.000 Russians killed.” And Russian esti­
mates were “1,500 killed.” A small bit of 
unconfirmed news was sufficient justification 
for one of the largest metropolitan newspapers 
to spread across its sheet the supposedly wel­
come news that 30,000 Russians were killed. 
American correspondents .sitting in Helsinki 
mysteriously' report on secret, free-moving
.. “suicide squadrons” that even the Finnish 
military authorities can know nothing about. 
The American press has proved that it wants 
to present only sensational reports.
The important question we think has been 
m decided. At all costs the United States wants 
to stay out of war. It cannot stay out by fo­
menting a popular anti-Russian or anti-German 
hate, or a blind pro-Ally allegiance. We should 
see that England and France are as responsi- 
. ale, basically, for the present war as .either 
Germany or Russia. And having so done we 
should keep our supposedly comfortable oceans 
free from contamination. We should not be 
too smug about our own security,- for it is 
thin, indeed. If the present extreme anti-Rus­
sian feeling in the United States is simply a 
vehicle by which the enemies of American pro­
letarian movements are attempting to destroy 
them here—then they should be treated as the 
real enemies-of peace^seeking Americans.
New Troubles in India 
Complicate War Scene
Reports of strikes and rioting in India that have 
already cost 100 lives have injected another serious 
problem into the war situation. A new eruption 
of the Indian struggle for self-rule- has been ex­
pected by political observers; recent events indi­
cate that the Indian nationalist leaders will try to 
take advantage of British preoccupation with the 
European war.
From the founding of the British East India Com­
pany under Elizabeth in 1600 to the present day, 
the English have faced uninterrupted opposition 
by the Indians to British rule. The use of troops 
to discourage nationalist elements has been the 
rule, not the exception. “Establishing order” in 
rebellious districts has become an accepted every­
day occurrence to such an extent that newspapers 
do not bother to carry details of these activities. 
Now and again the “London Illustrated News” de' 
scribes the “pacification” of Indian provinces; but 
this information reaches only a limited audience.
Occasionally the violence has become particularly 
serious and dramatic. Such was the case in the 
famous “Black Hole of Calcutta” incident and later 
in the more important “Sepoy Mutiny” of 1857-59. 
The seriousness of the mutiny prompted England 
to take India out of the hands of the India Com­
pany, which had been administrating the huge sub­
continent as a private enterprise.
Reform Acts Passed
The agitation of nationalists has resulted in sev­
eral reform acts which allow a small measure of 
participation by natives in the government. These 
acts however, do not even effectively camouflage 
British control of Indian affairs.
The activity of the Indian Congress Party of 
5,000,000 members, the moderate wing of which is 
led by Gandhi, is the latest and most serious 
threat to British imperial interest in India.
The nationalists claim that Britain is bleeding 
India of her wealth, neglecting the welfare of the 
inhabitants and stifling attempts at cultural devel­
opment. Though England has ruled India for al­
most 300 years, ninety-five per cent of the people 
are still in a state of illiteracy.
American consular officials in India have report­
ed that “the annual income of the worker does 
not exceed the equivalent of $45.00 a year, of which 
fully 80 per cent is spent in food and cotton 
clothing.”
In an attempt to avoid a crisis in India at the 
present time, the British government has sent Sir 
Stafford Cripps there in an unofficial capacity to 
try to persuade Nehru and Gandhi to hold their 
followers in check until the war is over.
The grievances of the Indian people are deep. 
Should the movement for independence get out of 
hand, there is no telling where it will stop or how 
it will influence other sections of the British 
Empire.

Not only is Mary Tuttle a member of the Tech 
clan, but she also belongs to a family clan, con­
sisting of her five brothers and sisters and her 
parents. They’re always together—right now 
they’re busy being proud of “their” new grand­
child.
She used to knit (not that that has anything to 
do with the grandchild), but since coming to Tech’s 
Secretarial De­
partment there 
hasn’t been 
too much time 
for it. A1 - 
though Mary 
likes her work, 
and has am­
bitions of 
someday being 
private secre­
tary to an ex­
ecutive, she 
doesn’t think 
that she’ll get 
that far be­
cause that takes 
time, and she 
wants to get married—someday.
Living in Pittsburgh all her life hasn’t 
made her like it any better than Lake Erie, where 
the Tuttle “clan” has spent summer for years and 
years.' She gets a tan there which lasts cluripg 
most of the winter. Swimming is her favorite 
sport, but she also likes golf, at which she says she 
is terrible, and tennis, ditto.
While she has no particular dislike, she usually 
finds some little thing to complain about, and 
radicals annoy her vei-y much. She can easily get 
involved in a political argument; too.
At Tech Mary has been treasurer of Cwens, 
Assistant Secretary of Student Council as a junior, 
and secretary this year; as a member of Gamma 
Phi Sigma she has taken part in Greek Sing and 
Swing.
In her spart time (when, she says) she pre­
fers dancing, mqvies of the kind of “My Man God­
frey” or those starring Bette Davis and Jimmy 
Stewart. She doesn’t care too much for swing 
music, .but would rather hear a smooth song, such 
as “All the Things You Are” and light opera music.
Turquoise ‘is her color, sports clothes the style.
Tuition Fee 
Increase Is 
Announced
(Continued from Page 1) 
come from endowment for sup­
port, Tech has been forced to 
seek new sources of revenue if it 
is to maintain the efficiency of its 
work, President Robert E. Doherty 
said. In years past, Tech has re­
ceived approximately half its rev­
enue for educational purposes 
from endowment investments. 
Tuitioh and fees accounted for the 
other half. During the difficult 
years of the depression since 1930, 
invested funds of all institutions 
and trusts have been experiencing 
a lower and lower average rate 
of return.
Carnegie Tech’s endowment in­
come has not escaped this down­
ward trend. A decrease since 1931 
of approximately one per cent, 
from 5.2 to about 4.2 per cent, 
while it has not been as drastic as 
the general average decrease ex­
perienced by other endowment 
funds, has nevertheless created a 
diffcult financial situation. Fur­
thermore, inasmuch as high-rate 
bonds now maturing or being call­
ed must be replaced with bonds 
yielding as low as 3 per cent re­
turn, the average rate of income 
may be expected to decrease fur­
ther, President Doherty pointed 
out.

y CUD* Job
Every job-seeker is a salesman. Getting a job 
is more than just filling in a card. You may want 
work desperately—part-time, full-time, or work 
during the summer; but regardless of the work, you 
must have something to sell. The Employment 
Bureau only gives the lead, after that you have to 
sell yourself.
Perhaps you need to know more about the types 
of work which may be done on a part-time basis. 
A. booklet entitled Student Self-Support is avail­
able in the Bureau of Recommendati6ns; it lists 
types of work done in previous years.
If a lead for a job is found and the work is 
something which requires much more or different 
experience from yours, news of it is welcome in 
the Bureau. As students pass along word about 
openings the Bureau becomes more effective and 
able to help more students, not only with general 
suggestions but with specific openings.
Religious Einuhasis Week
The committee in charge of the Religious Em­
phasis Week to be sponsored by Carnegie, Pitt, 
and P. C. W. will meet at the home of Mr. Davis on 
Wednesday at 8:00 o’clock to make up a program. 
Students and faculty members comprise the com­
mittee.
“Dark-Horse” 
Enters Race 
For Presidency
(Continued from Page 2)
Speaking of finances, the prob­
lem of the budget appears to be 
near solution. Mr. Sunderland 
already has someone in mind for 
the position of Comptroller-gen- 
eral. He is not ready to divulge 
his identity but he assured the 
TARTAN that his (Mr. Sunder­
land’s) sincerity and common 
sense would not desert him in 
such an important decision.
The program of the American 
Golden Rule Party is the answer 
to the problems confronting the 
American people, Mr. Sunder­
land explained. On the inter­
national question it stands for 
fair diplomatic tactful dealings 
and no entangling alliances. “I 
am always open to a disarmament 
conference,” he added.
The platform includes fair 
profits to the farmer, fair profits j 
to the business man, fair wages 
to the worker, a fair return to 
the distributor and fair prices to 
the consumer. This, and the 
elimination of unfair taxes will 
slowly do away with relief. The 
American Golden Rule Party al­
so stands for fairness to capital 
and labor.
On the all-important tariff 
question, the Oakland native son 
stands for a “protective tariff with 
consistent reciprocal features.” 
The new administration will be 
firm with communists and 
fascists Mr. Sunderland indicated.
Mr. Sunderland apologized for 
appearing ’ at the interview with 
only one tooth in the front of 
his mouth but promised to have 
a new set of teeth in time for 
his next campaign appearance.
Despite possible objections that 
Mr. Sunderland is a Pitt graduate 
the TARTAN has decided to sup­
port his candidacy unqualifiedly. 
Requests by the United Press that 
he grant them an interview • in­
dicate that others will fall in line. 
We feel that the good of the na­
tion is more important than col­
lege rivalries. We know that 
every student will jump on the 
Sunderland bandwagon with us.
Volunteers for the local cam­
paign committee are invited to get 
in touch with the TARTAN im­
mediately. Mr. Sunderland ex­
pects to have buttons and stickers 
out as soon as the bank comes 
through. Meanwhile there is work 
to be done. Help put Sunderland 
in the White House!
Students’ 
Health Plan 
Explained
‘Handbook’ Gives 
Entire Details
Confusion arising from students 
not understanding the Carnegie 
Student Health Service has 
prompted administration officials 
to request that the TARTAN ex­
plain the program.
This service, available to ALL 
day students, is explained as fol­
lows in the HANDBOOK. Par­
ticular attention should be given 
to the portion covering hospitaliz­
ation.
“The Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology provides upon the campus 
a Student Health Service for the 
benefit of all full-time students. 
The school physicians are availa­
ble at their offices during regu­
lar posted hours to all full-time 
students and upon call in the case 
of the illness in dormitories, fra­
ternities, or otherwise residing 
away from their homes.
“Should hospitalization be nec­
essary or desirable in the opin­
ion of the school physician, ar­
rangements are in effect with a 
nearby hospital for admitting the 
student to semi-private room 
service, the cost of which for a 
maximum of seven days will be 
borne by the school. Other costs 
including paid transportation, lab­
oratory fees, special meidcine, 
nursing, or medical attention 
aside from the services of the 
school physician must be borne 
by the students.
In general, the Health Service 
is designed to provide for emer­
gency illnesses and accidents but 
does not undertake to care for the 
expenses of extended illnesses nor 
the cost of operations for the re­
lief. of chronic conditions.”
SAI Pledges

A dinner was held in the 
Ruskin Apartments after the cere­
mony.
Walter Wilson 
Given Award
Walter Wilson ’40, was present­
ed with a key representing him as 
the most outstanding Kappa Sig­
ma in the Western Pennsylvania 
district at the annual. Kappa Sig­
ma Founder’s Day banquet De­
cember 11.
: The banquet took place under 
the sponsorship of the Pittsburgh 
Alumni Society at the University 
club. Also present at the meeting 
were His Honor Mayor Scully and 
the Worthy Grand Master of the 
Kappa Sigma Fraternity, Ham­
ilton Baker. The presentation of 
the key was performed by Mr. R. 
G. Bostwick.
Special Program 
To Re Broadcast
On Sunday, January M, Tek­
non Club will celebrate its twen­
tieth year of service. At 4:00 p,

’A USE THAT REFRESHES,
Bottled under audiority of The Coca-Cola Co. by
COCA-COLA BOTTLING COMPANY, PITTSBURGH. PA. 
----------------------=.--------------
According to most reports, last4 
Friday’s Intersorority Formal at 
the Bill Penn was more than good 
—it was practically perfect. Lots 
of alumni helped make the crowd 
almost too large for the floor, but 
that’s a good sign, too. Shows 
faith in the chairman, Beetle 
Mary Lou Campbell. Next on 
the program for the whole school 
is the Junior Prom, and rumor 
has it that there's a darn good 
orchestra being lined up. Now 
if only the Delta Skulls don’t in­
sist on too big a. kick-back, they 
may have something there. Don’t 
try last year’s tricks, boys.
We don’t mean to preach right 
now; but some guys seem to have 
a misplaced conscience, or none 
at all. We’re thinking of that 
light-fingered quality of finding 
things that haven’t been lost, or 
of not turning in the things that 
have. Even offers of rewards don’t 
do any good. It’s plenty bad 
enough when slide-rules left in 
classrooms are not returned. Ten 
bucks worth of slip-stick is plenty 
to lose. But the most brazen 
trick yet occurred when some 
slicker entered an unlocked of­
fice and carefully removed a 
brand new coat and hat. Maybe 
something ought to be done, that 
is, besides locking the office.
A certain plebe we won’t name 
certainly has guts. Last Satur­
day the dorms had a Jam Session, 
which is really just another name 
for a cut dance. This plebe saw 
Dr. Warden there liked his part­
ner (we can’t say wo blame him), 
and promptly cut in. Dr. Warden 
surrendered his wife for the next 
two dances.
Although we’re a little slow in 
getting around to it, we say that 
the Kiltie Band’s free tea dance 
was a real beau gestc. As a 
Christmas present to tho school, 
that Is. So don’t think that be­
cause football season Is over, the 
band has 'loafed. And when they 
ask you to buy a ticket, remem­
ber the free dance they gave you.
If the Interhonorary Fraternity 
Council that was to have been 
organized not long ago Is really 
serious In Its desire to abolish 
cheating in finals, It will have a 
banco* to lay Its cards on the ta­
ble in the next few weeks.
Headlines in the TARTAN this 
week are the five-year course in 
engineering, and we predict that 
the course is going to make head­
lines other places in the near fu­
ture. We say, off-hand, that such 
a course is unique in the country. 
And even if it isn’t, it still shows 
that Carnegie is not only one of 
the best technical schools in the 
country, but one of the most pro­
gressive, as well. Which is the 
one way to stay best.
A tough job at any school is to 
keep the alumni in good humor so 
that some day they may remem­
ber their alma mater with pleas­
ant memories and a little cash 
donation. Because you do the job 
with so little noise, Miss Spill­
man, many people sometimes for­
get you’re here. We’re going to 
make you conspicuous with the 
“Thistle of the Week.”

Although swimming, hockey, 
wrestling, boxing, and winter 
track are now in vogue, basketball 
is definitely the object of all of the 
sports talk around the campus, 
and the entire country for that 
matter.
After seeing sixteen basketball 
games played by 32 teams In 
Philadelphia, including such 
squads as Southern Cal, Stanford, 
California, and Oregon from the 
far west, Oklahoma and Texas 
from the south, and Temple, Penn, 
Columbia, and Dartmouth from 
the eastern seaboard, it Is my 
humble opinion that Rube Stark, 
the Tartán quintet’s rangy center 
ranks with the best if not the 
top of the hardwood players in 
the country. This view comes after 
seeing Vaugh of Southern Cal­
ifornia shoot the ball around the 
floor. . (The Tech five saw him 
play De Paul in Chicago after 
they had triumphed against 
Loyola, and believe me they were 
impressed.) If there was an All- 
American basketball team named 
it would be hard to leave Rube’s 
name oiit; and joining him would 
be Vaugh of Southern Cal, Soli 
Schechtam oí; Long Island U, and 
Boochey Bortel of Bradley Tech.
After the West Virginia trip I 
was reminiscing with a few of 
the alumni of Tech and they dug 
up the name of one’s of the Plaid’s 
immortals, “Babe” Patt, a star 
basketball and football player in 
the early thirties. Babe is now 
playing end lor the Cleveland 
Rams professional football team.
He was a six foot three, 210 
pound architect, and shown on 
both gridiron and basketball floor. 
His exploits are known far and 
wide. He was as colorful a player 
as Tech has seen, goocl as a guard 
and In shooting. To give you an
idea of how tough “Babe” was, 
one time Ernie Sesto, the boxing 
coach, asked Maxie Iiannum to 
lend him one man to give his star 
heavyweight a workout. Babe im­
mediately volunteered and a few 
minutes later Ernie was working 
over his heavyweight candidate, 
who was laid flat on the canvas, 
while Patt went back to basketball 
activities. Wherever he went, the 
crowds went for a riot was liablo 
to start any time he appeared on

Western Trip 
Yields One 
Win, One Loss
Last Saturday night the Tech 
varsity squad lost a thrilling and 
heart-breaking game to a fast 
West Virginia team at Morgan­
town. The Mountaineers out­
played the Scots in the first peri­
od, totalling 21 points to the 
Plaid’s 14. The second half, how­
ever, was a different story, the 
Skibos apparently getting the 
range, but losing the battle by 
a 44 to 39 tally. This was the 
second defeat of the week for 
the Tartans, having lost to the 
Westminster Titans on Wednes­
day, .50-44.
The Skibo Freshman squad, 
which travelled with their big 
brothers to Morgantown,' suffered 
the first setback of their season at 
the hands of the West Virginia 
Freshmen 48-43. The Frosh team 
shows great • promise this year 
with Smith, Brinn, Kaiser, and 
Patton as the stars.
On their western trip over the 
holiday vacation, the Tartans 
broke even, winning one game 
and losing one. Their victory 
was over Loyola at Chicago on 
the 18th, the game being part of 
a double-header with the South­
ern California-De Paul contest as 
the other half. Loyola’s wasn’t 
a very good match for the Ski­
bos, apparently lacking the nec­
essary spark. Their passing at­
tack was good, but their team 
didn’t have the “omph” which 
might have been provided had 
they had taller players, the squad 
being small in heighth. The Tar­
tans retained the lead . they got 
early in the game, freezing the 
ball the last five minutes of play, 
score —*15 to 3(5.
The Scot’s defeat by Bradley 
Tech on the 19th, however, was 
just a turn of the tables. A fifteen 
point lead by the Braves at the 
beginning of the second half was 
narrowed down to 4 when the 
Tartans showed a burst of spectac­
ular playing.
TARTAN FLOORMEN WELL SUPPORTED 
ON WESTERN TRIP
- By “DOC” BURKE, Sports Editor J
Carnegie Tech’s courtiuen met a great many friends on their 
short trip to the Midwest during Christmas vacation.
At the Loyola game in the Chicago Coliseum the team was 
given unexpected support by many former Techites, among 
whom were Tom Coulter, Don Fouse, Mark Miller, Bob Bihleiy 
Bill Goldsmith, and Bill .Wright.
„Tom Coulter may be remembered as one of Carnegie’s 
greatest athletes. He still holds more school track records than 
any other one person. Tom was a member of the Canadian 
Olympic .track team in 1932. He also played football and boxed 
while in school.
Don Fouse played both varsity football and basketball dur­
ing his stay at Tech.*****
The game with Loypla was played before a crowd of almost 
7,000 as the first half of a double header. U. S. C. defeated De 
Paul in the second game.* * * * *
Before the game, Coach Lennie Sachs of Loyola told his 
players: “If the red-lieaded fellow with the glasses has the
ball, you don’t have to get within ten feet of him.” However, 
Sturgeon came through with a couple baskets at the right time 
to help give the Ramblers their first home defeat in; 29 starts. *****
“Red Randall” Burch’s family drove from Benton Harbor, 
Michigan, to see their favorite son in action. And lie came 
through in fine style, leading the Tartan scorers with 11 points. 
Incidentally Randall received a telegram before the .game from 
an old admirer, wishing him luck.
Red gave an all-time high in impromptu speeches when he 
was interviewed by Guy Savage on the “Man in the Street 
Broadcast” in front of the Chicago Theater. The program was 
carried over the Mutual Network.
Leagues
Citcom Clan and Tau Delta Phi, 
both undefeated in three frays, 
load the standings in their respec­
tive intramural basketball leagues. 
In the Independent League, Hen­
derson Hall, which also sports a 
clean slate in two games, brings 
up second position. Third place 
finds a three-way tie between the 
high-scoring Printers Devils, the 
fast Freshmen Engineer’s squad, 
and a dark horse Delta Sigma 
Club aggregation. A hot fight 
among these leaders is promised 
before the champions are crown­
ed in the Spring.
The PiKAs, who are running 
second to the Tau Delts in the 
Fraternity League, have two vic­
tories and no defeats. These two 
pacemakers are the only entries 
in their league showing a per­
centage higher than .500.
Bowling: and Foul Throwing: 
Planned
Entries for bowling and foul 
throwing should be in by Feb­
ruary 3. _ Foul throwing, under 
the chairmanship of Jim Lee, is 
a new activity this year and it is 
hoped that the entry list will be 
large. If enough interest is 
shown, it will undoubtedly be­
come one of the permanent sports 
on the intramural program.
All entry lists should be ad­
dressed to the Intramural Board, 
Box 109 in care of the sport the 
team is entering. On entry include 
name and phono number of man­
ager or captain and full name 
of each participant.
There has been some confusion 
about the playing of table tennis 
matches, .so the Intramural Board 
has set up the following defini­
tions: a contest consists of 3 out 
of 5 matches, 4 singles and one 
doubles; a match consists’ of 3 out 
of 5 games; a game consists of 
21 points.

While everyone else was on a 
train headed home for the holi­
day, the Skibo Skaters were in 
Cleveland gaining their first vic­
tory of the year against a strong 
Western Reserve sextet. The game 
was a closely fought one, and it 
wasn’t until midway through the 
overtime period that Ivan Siva- 
check drilled an unassisted shot 
past the Reserve goalie for the 
only and deciding goal of the 
game.
The boys put into Cleveland 
again last Tuesday to don their 
skates for the first time in more 
than two weeks and skate against 
the League Champs, John Car­
roll’s Blue Streaks. By the time 
Tech had regained their skating 
legs halfway through the first pe­
riod, Arsenault and his mates had 
scored three quick goals to build 
up a strong. lead. For the rest 
of the game the playing was very 
rough, and since Carroll was con­
tent to sit back and protect its 
lead by packing the defense, Tech 
had very little oportunity to score. 
It was in this lifeless tashion that 
the game came to a close.
Tough One to Lose
Last Wednesday night, Tech 
faced off against the Dukes for the 
second time this year, and the re­
sult was the best game between 
the teams in two years. It was 
an evenly fought battle all the way 
except for a fluke goal late in the 
third period, otherwise Tech 
might have won the game. The 
first period v as void of any scor­
ing or thrills, but in the second 
stanza, things broke lose in a 
hurry, in fact barely 30 seconds 
after the start, with a goal by 
Vance to give thé Dukes a 1-0 
lead. But the Tartans sent four 
men down the ice and the result 
was a goal by Wilson on an as­
sist from Ament that tied the 
'sore. For the balance of the pe- 
ricd the teams took turns scoring

New Tuition Rates for 1940-41
ByAnnounced By Administration
Declining Revenues
From Endowments 
Necessitate Rise
Lower Bond 
Interest Cuts 
Fund Income
Increased tuition fees for the 
1940-41 school year face Carnegie 
Tech evening students as the re­
sult of declining revenues from 
endowments, it was announced to­
day.
Basic tuition will be increased 
from $3.00 to $3.60 per unit per 
semester. In addition, the gen­
eral fee, which all students pay 
and which includes the activities 
fee will be raised to $6.00.
Scholarship budgets have been 
increased in proportion to the rise 
in tuition, and an addition will be 
made to funds, available for grants 
to' both evening and day students. 
The Student Loan Fund will also 
be increased.
Declining income from invested 
funds was blamed for the in­
crease. Like other institutions 
which depend in large measure on 
income from endowment for sup­
port, Carnegie has been forced to 
seek new sources of revenue if it 
is to maintain the efficiency of 
its work, President Robert E. Do­
herty said, in a statement re­
leased today.
“In years past” the statement 
continued, “Tech has received ap­
proximately half its revenue for 
educational purposes from endow­
ment investments. Tuition and 
fees accounted for the other half. 
During the difficult years of the 
depression since 1930, invested 
funds of all institutions and trusts 
have been experiencing a lower 
and lower average rate of re­
turn.”
Maturing and called bonds are 
aggravating the situations, since 
the bonds carried a high rate of 
interest, and must now be replaced 
with securities paying as low as 
three per cent. Consequently the 
average income rate is expected 
to continue to decline.
Carnegie Tech has postponed 
the increase longer than many en­
dowed institutions. The increase 
which went into effect this year 
was comparatively small, and was 
felt most in the College of En­
gineering.
Even with the increases an­
nounced to date, tuition at Car­
negie Tech are lower than those 
of many privately-supported in­
stitutions. • As a comparison, the 
statement compares the $180 per 
semester tuition with annual tu­
itions of $400 to $600 in effect at 
other endowed technical schools.
The new tuition increase af­
fects both day and evening stu­
dents. The administration pointed 
out that this is the first change 
that has been 'made in the day 
school basic charge for full-time 
students since 1927. For most ¦ 
full-time students the increase 
will amount to $30.00 per se­
mester.
Pen Points
Ed Nuss-
Amid the noise and Confusion 
of horns, whistles and bells, the 
cries of “Hapy New Year,” and 
the falling flakes of confetti, we 
bade adieu to 1939 and said “hel­
lo” to 1940. Each year, for as 
long as any of us can remember, 
we have been greeting each new 
year the same way. Few of us, 
however, can recall welcoming a 
year which holds such potent pos­
sibilities, for 1940 brings not only 
a new year, but it introduces a 
new decade of history.
As we stand on the brink of 
this new period, let us pause 
and review the past one. Begin­
ning with one of the worst de­
pressions recorded in history, and 
continuing through years • which 
witnessed the election and re- 
election of our president, the 
birth of the New Deal, the bloody 
war in Spain and China, and fi­
nally climaxed by the present 
madness in Europe, the past de­
cade gives a cross-section of a 
period seldom paralleled in this 
or any other lifetime.
During the past ten years in our 
own country we have been sub­
jected to the extremes of nature— 
floods, draught, famine and plen­
ty, as though nature herself were 
expressing her displeasure of the 
happenings of the world. Factories 
were idle, and men walked the 
streets, lost in the depths of des­
pair, while the soap-box orators 
talked of solving all our prob­
lems by overthrowing our present 
government and substituting one 
of the various forms of “isms.” 
In Europe, where one man can 
rule a nation, even the sacredness 
of the church was attacked. As 
the decade approached its end the 
war mongers in Europe could not 
restrain themselves and the world 
was once again plunged into war. 
The impetus it caused was enough 
to move business in this country 
away from dead center, and once 
again the factories hummed with 
activity. As the final curtain 
came down, one of the smallest 
successfully defending her free­
dom against unjustified attack of 
one of the world’s largest human 
democracies in the world was 
monopolies.

OFFICER
EDITORIALS
Dear Old Tech
That there is a vast difference 
between administrative methods 
at Carnegie and at other major 
schools has long been covertly 
acknowledged. It is becoming 
common knowledge at Tech now 
and many people are commenting 
that they are fortunate to be at­
tending a school where affairs are 
handled so justly and on a really 
co-operative basis. Here one 
finds the Golden Rule in actual 
application—hard and fast lines 
are sometimes bent just a little, if 
the circumstances surrounding the 
case seem to warrant some leni­
ency.
Conditions at Carnegie—and 
they are the direct opposite of 
conditions at some of the other 
large institutions in Pittsburgh— 
provide that if there is a course 
which is improperly presented, an 
instructor who is not prepared for 
presentation of his subject, or any 
other fault in the curriculum, the 
Administration is not only willing 
to listen to a just criticism but 
is anxious to hear it and to cor­
rect the difficulty. President Do­
herty and his “lieutenants” are 
glad to adjust anything that stands 
in the way of a bigger and belter 
Carnegie, arjd they consequently 
receive without malice all criti­
cism, adverse or otherwise. At 
least once a year administrative 
and department heads gather with
Evening Student Council repre­
sentatives for the express purpose 
of receiving such comments.
Usually the other schools in this 
city must hold their dances in a 
hotel or club ball-room. At Car­
negie Tech, Thistle Hall was built 
to fill this need. For very large 
crowds the Gymnasium is brought 
into use but somehow a spirit of 
coziness pervades Thistle. Groups 
from other schools invariably 
comment at the fortunate situa­
tion where even social functions 
are a part of the school scheme 
and are enhanced by the fact that 
faculty members are glad to sac­
rifice their precious evenings to 
chaperon the dances.
With all the facts in mind, is 
there any other major school in 
the country where students are 
given as much co-operation as 
here at Carnegie Tech? Even to 
Carnegie Union (New Alumni 
House) open for the convenience 
of groups who find it desirable to 
meet, all assistance has been giv­
en to both students and faculty. 
This house has real “home” at­
mosphere, presided over by a 
gracious hostess, not only to greet 
Tech people but groups from other 
schools are made to feel welcome 
here also.
Little more than a casual sur­
vey is required to see that the 
spirit of the noble Andrew Car­
negie remains here to guide the 
hands that now hold the reins.
Gala Holiday 
Affair Held 
By Engineers
Clies Walters’ Bund 
Popular With Crowd
Amid the gala pre-holiday at­
mosphere the College of Engineer­
ing held their annual Christmas 
Dance in the gymnasium.
The gymnasium was decorated 
in the most unusual manner ever 
used on the campus. Because of 
basketball season, it was impos­
sible to remove the bleachers from 
the floor. The committee solved 
the problem most satisfactorily by 
converting them into snow cov­
ered hillsides upon which ever­
greens were placed. There were 
lots of green holly wreaths, col­
ored lights, evergreens, and mis­
tletoe for those shy boys who 
needed some encouragement. 
Then, the good old crystal ball 
was hung in its usual position 
near the middle of the floor.
The music for the occasion was 
furnished by Ches Walters and 
his orchestra, who proved so 
popular at his last campus ap­
pearance that he was asked to re- 
| turn. The band features the 
smoother style of music, but they 
“swung” one often enough to 
satisfy these rabid devotees of 
“jive.”
The first two hundred girls 
who arrived .were given a cor­
sage. These were really of a dis­
tinctive type. Instead of the us­
ual make-up of cut flowers, they 
were made of Christmas greens 
and hemlock cones, and could be 
worn during the entire holiday 
season. All the fellows were giv­
en programs which were equally 
distinctive, and made a welcome 
addition to many girls’ souvenir 
chests.
The Black Cat room was open 
during the evening for those who 
required refreshments, and a ca­
pacity crowd was in attendance 
during, the evening.
The dance was held under the 
supervision of the officers of the 
College of Engineering — F. J. 
Young, President; R. Thomnson! 
Vice President; R. Hull, Secre­
tary and J. Fisher, Treasurer.
Monday Vs. Friday
Two of the newer organizations 
(unofficial) to spring up this sea­
son are Missouri’s Oh, Hell It’s 
Monday club, successor to their 
famous Thank God It’s Friday or­
ganization. The latter originated 
in Journalism School, but journal­
ists are spending their time now 
wondering why they should 
thank God it’s Friday when they 
have Saturday classes.

¦x * *
Bob Thompson 
Is New Officer 
Of Engineers
New Vice President 
Active On Council
Robert Bawn Thompson, popu­
lar young “jitterbug” of the cam­
pus, was elected to the office of 
Vice-President of the Engineering 
College in October.
This young man’s history is 
very interesting. He was born in 
Northern Ireland, in the city of 
Belfast, where he gained his early 
education. He came to this coun­
try in 1933 with his mother, his 
father having preceded them by 
several years. Since that time 
Wilkinsburg has been their home 
and in Wilkinsburg High School 
Bawn received his secondary 
training.
Soccer, the national sport of 
Ireland, claimed his attention un­
til an injury to his ankle during 
a game demanded his withdrawal 
from further participation.
He entered Carnegie Tech three 
years ago, spending one year in 
Industries. This is his second year 
in the College of Engineering^ 
where he is pursuing studies in 
the Metallurgical Engineering
course.
Bawn is employed in the Pur­
chasing Department of the Jones 
& Laughlin Steel Corporation. All 
of his ambition is centered in one 
thought—to get into the Jones & 
Laughlin Research and Develop­
ment Laboratory in Hazelwood, 
where, he avers, the finest steel 
in the world is developed.
He is well-fitted for the post 
of Assistant Social Chairman, to 
which post he was elected at the 
first meeting of Evening Student 
Council ih November, since his 
one hobby is dancing and listening 
to a variety of dance bands.' He 
has gained a wide knowledge of 
band styles and his friends con­
sider him a critic in this field.
Blonds, brunettes and titian- 
haired girls are „ his favorites—as 
long as they are beautiful. In 
other words, he loves them all if 
they have that one last qualifica­
tion. His heart is as yet his own, 
and his freedom seems to be held 
at a high price.
He is a member of two- even­
ing fraternities, Nu Sigma Alpha 
and Phi Pi Psi.

Nu Sigma Alpha, evening

Dancing was in order in the 
ballroom from 8:30 until midnight 
at which time a supper was serv­
ed to all brothers and friends. 
The Anniversary Dance has been 
an annual affair celebrated every 
January since the founding of 
this fraternal group. This event 
is in part a reunion for all for­
mer members of the group and 
gives them a chance to renew 
old friendships and acquaintances 
which have been broken by the 
ravages of time.
Chester Biscup, Preceptor of the 
Fraternity, was chairman of this 
most successful supper dance and 
was ably assisted by Harold Park, 
Ed MacDonald, and Steve Marcin- 
izyn,
Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity has 
always taken a prominent part 
in the development of the pro­
jects on the campus and has 
pledged itself to further the ac­
tivities of the Evening Student 
Council. Evening students who 
have shown interest in activities 
are pledged at some campus func­
tion. Membership in this organi­
zation does not affect the mem­
ber’s standing in any other or­
ganization.
Dances, dinners, stags and card 
parties have been interspersed in 
the activities schedule of this 
group. The next dance of the 
fraternity will be held March 30, 
1940.

Prof. Leeds Ends 
Long Service Here
(Continued from Page 1) 
he leaves. He plans to work on 
a hospital organization plan which 
he, a clergyman, two ‘doctors, and 
a lawyer conceived in the sum­
mer of 1938. The hospital would 
serve a region known as the cen­
tral Adirondacks with a popula­
tion of about 6,000 people in the 
winter and 20,000 in the summer. 
An unusual feature of the hospital 
plan is that of getting many of 
the people of the district as an­
nual dues paying members before 
attempting to obtain endowment 
funds from the wealthy people in 
the region.
Prof. Leeds has been head of 
Shops for several years and is also 
manager of the U. S. Army Gauge 
Laboratory at Carnegie. He was 
Carnegie’s first Treasurer of Ath­
letics and did much in this po­
sition to secure our present play­
ing fields and athletic facilities.

ter, will be held Saturday, Janu­
ary 13 in Thistle Hall. The af­

aminations.
Jimmy Earle’s orchestra will 
provide music in the delightful 
style that has made it one 'of the 
most popular local outfits. Previ­
ous Tech dances at which they 
performed have been exceptional­
ly successful. Their popularity is 
further attested to by the fact that 
they were selected as the number 
one band on the New Year’s “Pa­
rade of Bands,” over station 
WCAE. “Chuzzy” Ross, an at­
tractive and personable singer, 
will be featured with the band. 
Those who have seen her report 
that she will be a visual as well 
as vocal asset to the affair. •
The usual fee of one dollar per 
couple will be payable at the door. 
Lovely corsages will be distribut­
ed to the first two hundred to at­
tend. Dancing will commence at 
nine o’clock and continue ’till

All arrangements for the affair

tioned pair who are respectively

sistant Social Chairman of the Ev­
ening Student Council.

Students of the Drama Depart­
ment will present a new play en­
titled “The Lower Depths,” by

the drama department.
