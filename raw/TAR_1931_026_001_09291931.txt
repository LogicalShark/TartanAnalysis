VOL. XXVI, No. 1.CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PA.TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1931:
ELMER KENYON IS NEW HEAD OF DRAMA DEPARTMENT; FACULTY CHANGES FEW FOR COMING YEAR
Chester Wallace Remains; 
to Concentrate on 
Production
TWELVE APPOINTED
Clark M. Humphreys Gets 
Ahrens Professorship 
in Heating
Few changes will be made in'llic 
faculty of the Carnegie Institute 
o( Technology for the coming col­
lege session. Only twelve appoint­
ments have been made for this 
ycat- on the regular day faculty of 
the institution.
Chief among the new appointees 
is Elmer Kenyon of the Thea­
ter Guild of New York, who re­
turns to his native Pittsburgh to 
direct the Department of Drama 
at Tech. Chester Wallace, the far­
mer director, will remain as pro­
fessor of drama and playwriting. 
y'lMre new arrangement will afford 
Mr. Wallace more time for direc­
tion .and production.
Another appointment of impor­
tance is that of Clark M. Humph­
reys as assistant professor in charge 
of the Department of Heating and 
Ventilation. Mr. Humphreys will 
hold the Theodore Ahrens Pro­
fessorship which was established 
by the Standard Sanitary Manufac­
turing Company six years ago. Mr. 
Humphreys, a graduate of Ohio 
State University, has held a posi­
tion with the Ohio State Archi­
tects for the past six years. He 
will be assisted in his work at 
, Tech by Theodore F. Rockwell, a 
I graduate of the University of Min- 
1 nusola.
\ j Jn'j the Department of Architec- 
(' lure, one appointment was made., 
j Luther S. Lashmit, a graduate of

Wage Survey Is 
Favorable To 
Tech Graduates
Research is Conducted By 
John D. Beatty of 
Local Bureau
1 Aii interesting survey conducted 
tby John D. Beatty entitled the 
‘‘Relation Between an Engineering 
Education and Income" appeared 
/in volume 23, the September, 
'¦1931, issue of Industrial and En­
gineering Chemistry. Mr. Beat­
ty, secret'arjr of the Bureau of 
Recommendations, Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology, endeavored to 
determine how the salaries of en­
gineers compare with the salaries 
of men in other professions; what 
groups in the engineering profes­
sion receive the best salaries, and 
' how the salaries of the engineering 
graduates of Carnegie compare with 
the salaries of graduates from other 
engineering institutions.
| Results .show that the highest 
plaries have been received by the 
'graduates of the Metallurgical and 
Commercial Engineering depart­
ments and that the median yearly 
f alary of Carnegie men for the 
jirst ten years’ out of school was 
higher than the median salary of 
bther engineering graduates. The 
total income of Carnegie engineers 
/Compares favorably with the incomes 
iu members of other professions 
(Aver the same twenty-year period. 
Rirther estimates show that, only
31 or 4 per cent of the Carnegie 
alumni were unemployed at June, 
1931, while the percentages of the 
otal number of unemployed work- 
,¦'! in the United States varied 
pm 10 to 25 per cent.
Such a study was made possible 
t Carnegie by the system of cor- 
ispondcncc between the employ- 
lent office and the graduates which 
as been in effect since the found- 
ig of the institution in 1903. The 
ureau is especially anxious to hear 
om the men who have secured 
ibs this summer upon its recom- 
iendation. First-hand information

Freshman Cheerleaders 
To Try Out Tomorrow
All Freshmen who arc in­
terested in tryouts for cheer- 
leading are asked to report 
at the first practice on 
Wednesday, September 30, at 
4:30 in the gymnasium. This 
activity affords an opportun­
ity to earn a letter and to 
see all games both at home 
and abroad.
At the first home game on 
Saturday letters will be 
formed in the cheering sec­
tion. It is urged that those 
who ai'e interested be present 
at the first practice, because 
it is necessary to learn the 
letter formations for the 
Saturday game.
Regulations May 
Be Shortened By 
Council This Year
The Freshman Regulation pe­
riod this year will be shorter than 
ever before if the recommenda­
tion of last year’s Student Coun­
cil is acted upon favorably by the 
new body. It was proposed that 
the term, which begins today at 
noon, be concluded at the start of 
the Thanksgiving recess, whereas 
it has never before been shorter 
than one semester.
In compensation for the short­
ening plans were formed to make 
more intensive the enforcement of 
regulations during that period. W. 
A. Conway, who is chairman of 
the Regulations Committee, is 
making preparations for more 
orderly lin’d effective trials in both 
dormitories and colleges.
In addition to this recommen­
dation, Student Council also re­
moved from the regulations the 
provision preventing freshmen 
from speaking to members of the 
opposite sex while on the campus.
The ten regulations to which 
all the freshmen of Carnegie must 
conform arc as follows:
(1) ICnoWall the Carnegie songs 
and yells.
(2) March last in all parades, 
both on and off the. campus.
(3) Join in all college demon­
strations.
(‘I) Attend all assemblies.
(5) At all times offer scats to 
faculty visitors and upperclassmen 
at general assemblies and athletic 
contests.
(6) Give preference to upper­
classmen in the halls, on the 
stairs, and on the walks.

Material published in this year’s 
Puppet will show a marked im­
provement over that of former 
years. Not only -will the style be 
different, there bein^ more long 
articles and fewer short jokes, but 
the t^pe of humor used will under­
go a real/ change. It is the staff’s 
desire to put out one of the best 
magazines in its class, and judg­
ing from the first issue they will 
no' fall short from the jmarlc.
.This year the Puppet and Humor 
have arranged a supscription plan 
whereby both magazines may be

PROF. SQUITIERI 
MODELS HOUSES
Professor Louis Squitieri, of the 
Sculpture department, .has com­
pleted a model for a house project 
near Olympia Park in Mt. 'Wash­
ington in collaboration with the 
Buelil Foundation. Mr. Squitieri 
was aided by Carl Schelf, part 
time instructor of the Department 
of Agriculture.
The model of clay is three feet 
wide and five feet long. It is a 
plan for twenty-five buildings, hous­
ing one hundred and twenty-seven 
families in two, three and five fam­
ily dwellings. The buildings arc 
to be made of brick in plain de­
sign- with plaques of stone as a 
center of interest. The designs 
of the plaques will be symbols 
representing Pittsburgh, Washing­
ton and Duqucsnc.
Professor Squitieri and Mr. Schelf 
started work on the model in the 
Department of Sculpture early in 
July, worked through July, and 
completed it during the latter part 
of August. The^construction of 
the house project was started at

Faculty Members Return From
European Invasion During Summer
Thirteen Travelers Collect 
Interesting Tales and 
Souvenirs
By Roy L. Grant
Europe . has been definitely estab­
lished as the favorite vacation land 
of Carnegie faculty members for 
nearly a score of th6m turned pil­
grim during the past summer and 
invaded Belgium, France, Ital}', the 
Balkan countries, and the other 
numerous nations on the continent.
Most of them have returned bring­
ing souvenirs with them (with a 
tactful approach you may sec the 
souvenirs of those who- visited 
France and Germany), and arp now 
prepared for the winter’s w'ork. 
Among these arc Dean Green, Pro­
fessor Trinks, Professor Aston, who 
was accompanied by his wife and 
daughter, Professor and Mrs. Parisi, 
Professor Grapin, Professor Hitchens, 
Miss Frances King and Mrs. Ed­
monds.
A few left Europe apparently with 
much reluctance for; jhe^ are ¿till
arriving or have yet to arrive. Dr. 
Ross, who visited France and points 
of interest in Egypt,' will commence 
school a day late by arriving to­
morrow; while Dr. Krivobok re­
mained for a few days in Boston 
before finally deciding to return to 
Carnegie, arriving yesterday.'
Dean Green spent her European 
vacation in Paris and in the city of 
Grenoble, France, in the high Alps, 
where she enlisted in the preparatory 
department of the University of 
Grenoble for seven weeks. In her 
conversation class of six students— 
the maximum number allowed per 
instructor—she had a heterogeneous 
mixture of classmates, including one 
Hungarian, one Pole, one Rumanian, 
one American, and one Canadian. 
The principal articles of furniture at 
a classroom at Grenoble, Dean Green 
says, were two planks, one a seat 
and the other a desk, mutually 
shared by the six students, and a 
crude table for the instructor. An 
agreeable feature of attending school 
at the University of Gre'noble was a 
trip into the Alps each week end.

Freshman Registration is 
Twenty-four Less Than 
Last Year
609 FRESHMEN ENTER
Margaret Morrison College 
Figures Show Only 
Increase
Registration figures tip to four 
o’clock Saturday afternoon, Septem­
ber 26, show that the enrollment1' of 
freshmen this year is slightly under 
that of last year. The total number 
of freshmen regisered is 609. They 
wcre distributed as follows: In the 
Colleges of Engineering and Indus­
tries, 326; in the College of Fine 
Arts,-133, and in Margaret Morrisoii, 
150.
Compared with the enrollment of
1930, these figures mean that there 
is a decrease of 42 in the Colleges 
of Engineering and Industries, ft 
decrease of eleven, in the College. ota 
Fine Arts, and an »increase of 19' in 
Margaret Morrison. The total differ­
ence between the registration of this 
year and that of last year is 24, or 
633 freshmen in 1930, and 609 in
1931.
As far as the registration of up- 
pcr-classmcn is i concerned, Alan 
Bright, Registrar, believes that there, 
will be no material reduction in the 
enrollment for day . classes. Mr. 
Bright’s opinion is that in spite of. 
current financial difficulties, every 
sacrifice will be made to send the 
student to college when work is un­
available. In view of this fact, he 
says that the enrollment is likely to 
be the same.
Last week’s registration ¦ also in­
cluded an additional 68 students1 who 
arc upper-classmen. There were 35 
in the College of Industries, 9 in the 
College of Engineering, and 24 in 
the Carnegie Library School. "When 
the ,above students are taken into 
account, the total enrollment of last 
week was 677.
Y.W.C.A. Starts 
Work With Big 
Sister Program
Elizabeth Phillips is New 
President; Tea to 
Be Given
Elizabeth Phillips will be presi­
dent of the Y. W. C. A. for the 
ensuing year in the place of Janet 
McClelland, who was unable to 
return to school this fall. Miss 
Phillips is a senior in the Paint­
ing and Decorating department 
and a member of the Beta Pi 
sorority.
The big and little sister move­
ment is one of the Y. W. C. A.’s 
most important undertakings and 
in order to assure success for this 
year the chairman, Gertrude No­

Under the able tutalcge of Paul 
Allison, who is assisted by Tank 
Highbcrgcr and' John Karcis, the 
Freshman squad of 30 has simmered 
down to a dozen or morerplayers of 
particular promise on the gridiron.
The Plebes will open their four- 
game schedule with the Wash-JcfF 
Freshmen in the Carrfegie Bowl on 
Saturday morning. Pretty fair ma­
terial is on hand, and cither team 
has an even chance to cop the 
laurels.'
With eligibility still a question, 
the team will be picked from the 'fol­
lowing : Center, Moscrip; guards,
Merlo, Anderson and Spencer; 
tackles, Plummer and, Moore; ends, 
Goodridge and Berg; backfield, 
Mijim, Spisak, Tercbus, Carlson and 
Urban.
By George Myers
A crippled Carnegie team, minus 
the services of two' top notch line­
men, pried the lid off the 1931 sea­
son with a 25 to 0 win over the 
University of Buffalo team. Showing 
raggedncss in their play, the Plaid 
squad was only slightly impressive, 
and the game was relieved of flash 
and color with the exception of a 
few spots.
"Man Mountain” Croft,, the huge 
sophomore tacklc, and “Bunny” 
Burzio, stellar guard, were kept from 
entering the fracas on account o£ in­
eligibilities, and their last minute re­
moval caused Wally to furnish sub­
stitutions in the line.
Although each quarter brought a 
touchdown for the Plaid, the game 
was lacking in thrills and marked 
mainly by the failure of the Car­
negie offense to click. Ragged play 
ruined several advances under the 
shadow of the Bison’s goal post. The 
Tartan backfield ran around in live­
ly fashion, but they were unable to 
keep their stampede steady.
Army Scores 
The opening kick-off saw the 
Plaid carry the ball to the 40-yard 
line, and then lose it on downs. 
However, the Bisons showed no im­
pression of an offensive strength, 
and, after a series of punts, the 
Skibo squad was set in dead earnest 
for a score. Kavel got loose on a few 
beautiful end runs and ofT-tacklc 
plays, and finally put the ball on the 
Bull’s 25-yard line. Here Army broke 
away twice to cross the goal line, 
being called back in his first at­
tempt by an \ off-side play. Sample’s 
try for the extra point was blocked 
and the quarter ended 6 to 0 in 
favor of Carnegie.
Plaid Flashes Form 
At the beginning of the second 
half the Plaid showed a flash of 
their old power.- They kicked off to 
the Bisons and7 then held their op­
ponents intact. After getting pos­
session of a punt on their own 35- 
yard line, the Tartans leveled an 
attack. Kavel smacked center for 14 
yards, Dcugcr tossed a neat pass 
to Tony Ostrosky, and then George 
Kavel swung wide for a beautiful 
run around right ¦end and 36 yards 
to the goal. The remainder of the 
quarter was a scries of punts and 
loss of the ball on downs.
The Tartans scored their final 
tally in the fourth .quarter from two 
nice heaves from the hands of 
Beviveno. The first Ostrosky caught 
and carried to the 20-yard strip, 
and then Buck Ewing took the final 
one across the goal line.
Kavel Stars 
The best ball carrying , of the day 
was done by George Kavel who got 
through the line, off tackle, or 
a found the ends almost at will. Rag­
ged secondary interference prevented 
him more than once from getting 
loose for a touchdown.
Kavel averaged eight yards cvci-y 
time lie took the ball, his best effort 
being a run of 27-yards. Armentrout 
had an average of six yards, and 
Dcuger, carrying the ball on three 
‘‘Goose’’ plays, averaged 14 yards.
The remainder of the game was 
marked by constant substitution from 
the Skibo bench, and a volley of last 
minute passes that meant nothing.
W. & J. Looms Big 
Next Saturday brings Carnegie 
playing the opening home game at 
the Stadium against W. & J. A 
tough battle is expected and the out­
come is .somewhat in doubt. The 
game promises to be a scrap from 
beginning to end. Last year the 
Plaid crushed the Presidents in a 
big way, and there is but little 
doubt that Wash-Jeff wish to turn 
the tables next Saturda}'.
A
 PIPEFUL of good tobacco is dis­
tinctly a man’s smoke. The 
women (long may they wave!) have 
taken over most 
Si our masculine
M&H privileges. But 
pipe smoking still 
belongs to us.
A typical scenc at the recent Tartan Football Training Camp where Coaches Steffen and Waddell com­
bined the brain activities with those of the brawn to produce a well-groomed aggregation for the 1931 season.

The pipe is not for M men at

that the pipe offers die rarest pleasures 
a man could ask of his smoking.
When you smoke a pipe, be sure

Edgeworth is the

augmented by Mitchell, ^captain of 
the former Plcbe team, Allen, Wil­

tion this season.
Cross-country at Carnegie is quick­
ly gaining its well-deserved share 
of interest. In order to develop a 
capable squad it is necessary fon the 
runners to spend many afternoons 
of concentrated work in the paths 
of Schenley Park. A trip to New 
York awaits the “first eight” Varsity 
runners on Thanksgiving day for a 
meet with the New York University 
harriers. This also 'means attendance 
at the Carnegie football game, and 
any other amusements that may fall 
in the road of the runners.
The remaining meets on. the sched­
ule are home engagements. They -in­
clude Geneva, October 24; West­
minister, October 31; Pitt, Novem­
ber 7; West Virginia, November 14. 
The meets will be held at 11:30‘A. 
M. on the above Saturdays with the 
start and finish on Flagstaff hill.
Steffen and Waddell Bring 
Squad Along in 
Fine Shape
The Carnegie Football Training 
Camp opened officially in the Bowl 
this year 011 August 26. Although, 
for some time previous Managers 
Treon and Zcigler had their squad 
of assistants busy getting things in 
top shape before the thundering herd 
arrived. The first day was spent in 
outfitting the men and getting every­
one settled in the tents which were 
erected to house the squad for the 
training, period.
During the first practice Wally 
startled the Eastern part of the foot­
ball hemisphere with a scrimmage. 
The results were not forgotten for 
days to come and it seems most 
everyone was limping into' Trainer 
Bert Munhall with some ailment or 
other. Sore muscles and the various 
orders of “Charley horses” were evi­
dent. Many of the last year’s fresh­
men soon learned that life in a 
football training camp was anything 
but a bed of roses.
However, for the next week or 
two things slowed down somewhat 
Everyone rose at 7:15 a‘. m.,1 and 
breakfast was tschcduled for 7:30. 
Activity began at 10 o’clock with 
uniforms on the field; The morning 
practice included setting-up exercises 
under the notable Doc Marks. After 
this the regular practice was held 
under tljtf eyes of Wally Steffen, 
Bob - Waddell and A1 Irwin. Lunch 
was under the belt by 1 p. m., and 
then another rest followed until the 
afternoon session at 4 p. m. Dinner! 
was served at 7:30 p. 111., and so to 
bed at eleven.
Squad Takes Shape
The second and third weeks 
brought the team rounding into a 
somewhat 'definite form, although 
there was plenty of competition for 
tlic various positions. Linemen were 
plenty, but the backfield was a source 
of worry and anxiety for many. 
Scrimmages were held every Mon­
day, Thursday and Saturday, every 
man being thoroughly tested for his 
football ability.
The fourth week saw little let-up 
in the battle for positions, but the 
first team was fairly definite; Lewis, 
Stewart and Ostrosky at the ends; 
Flctchcr, Croft and Forsmen at 
tackles; Sample, Drcshar, Ivcbc and 
Burzio at the guards, and Ducanis, 
O’Toole and Jones at center. In the 
backfield, Captain Armentrout, Kavel, 
Pounccy, Dueger, Bcviviuo, Heinzer 
and Sayles were doing most of the 
work with keen competition.
Freshmen Squad to Begin 
Practice Next 
Week
Varsity cross - country activities 
will stage a formal opening Wednes­
day, September 30. Coach Guy Hal- 
ferty has called the meeting for 5 
p. m. in the Trophy Room. All 
former runners and any interested 
upper classmen are requested to at­
tend.
Freshman aspirants in this line of 
sport are urged to meet in the 
Trophy Room on ^Iondajr, October 5, 
at 5 p. m. Previous experience is 
not required.
Carnegie cross-country teams of 
the past have enjoyed certain - parts 
of the winning habit, but last year’s 
team proved to be a more or less 
disappointing exception. However, 
few men have been lost by gradua­
tion, so the remaining letter men, to­
gether with the. members of last 
year’s crack freshmen outfit, will 
form a comforting nucleus for the 
squad of the coming season.
Ralph Frank, Silver, and Krebs 
ran away with the coveted diploma 
last June, and their efforts will be 
grcatl}' missed this fall. Among the 
letter men ‘ preforming this season 
arc Captain Jess Price, two-time 
captain and holder of the present 
school course record, Ramsaj', nura-
Murray Giies Armentrout, captain 
of Steffen’s football combination for 
the coming season, is one of Pitts­
burgh’s few contributions to’ the 
Skibo line-up. His 18S pounds of 
driving power extend 6’ feet 2 
inches skyward. Army . entered the 
first-string role in his sophomore 
year and since that time he has 
been toting pigskins in Carnegie’s 
direction, regardless of many would- 
be tacklcrs.
The “Big Train” docs not confine 
his taftnt to the gridiron for he 
has proved himself an asset to the 
.basketball team, and also holds the 
hammer throw ..record for ..the ,track 
team. The notorious Army upheld 
the' dignity of his Printing Depart­
ment last Spring when lie ascended 
to the throne of Campus King via 
popular selection.
Here’s the smoke for 
mdn, a pipe and good 
tobacco.

At last—September has almost dis­
appeared from the calendar, I mean 
1931. calendar, and this brings us 
closer and closer to an eventful 
time in the lives of all night stu­
dents. I suppose you know what I 
mean, but if you don’t, or your 
memory is so short that you can’t 
recall the past year, I will let you in 
on the secret—night registration with 
all its attenuating circumstances—gee 
I’m glad I got that off my chest. 
This period is a most trying time 
for all of us, even those who are 
on the other side of *.hc tables. 
Every one heaves a sigh when it is 
over. You better get out before jd.l 
the classes are filled and there will 
be no more room. A tip to the wise 
—come early. .
. •. i v *******
I was. out on the campus just to 
look things over, and what do you 
suppose I' -encountered—believe it or 
not—but it$.true—tz(]0 teams of well 
fed yellow horses were grazing on 
the quadranglei They were sleek and 
in prime condition which indicated 
that they were well fed during the 
summer as we had a very heavy crop 
of corn, oats, etc. Noiv they arc 
stronger than ever with their yellow 
coats all ready to put up a bold 
front to the intruders. It would be 
a splendid idea if some one would 
devise a means of planting posies 
or something in this driveway just 
by way of beautifying the campus. 
A splendid idea, now don’t every 
body start a repression garden— 
there wouldn’t be room for the 
horses if we did.
.*******
I haven’t had time to get all the 
dope about the new things which 
have been installed during the holi­
days, but I have my eyes open and 
as soon as I get the lowdown, I’ll 
let you in on the secret. I did notice, 
.however, the elongation of one of 
the shops facing the quadrangle on 
the Industries side — skyward — it 
seems that this tnd suddenly be­
came unsightly after all these years 
and so to balance the architectural 
beauties of the campus the ad .iticn 
was made—just to beautify' the 
<"'"t)us 3’ou know. Then, too, I noticed 
¦M"'strong odor of newly painted 
' woodwork in the corridors of In- 
, dustrics which all goes to show that 
they did do something to old Car­
negie, during the summer.
Plaid Sports Comments
With the advent of fall comes the 
college' football season and Carnegie 
• is as much in evidence in this re­
spect as ever before. The Tartans 
have an attractive schedule that ¿s 
going to tax the players • to their 
utmost and call out all the strategy 
that Waddell and Steffen! can muster.
Very few of last year’s, varsity are 
available as graduation took several 
of the best linemen and ball toters 
. that have graced out institution for 
some time. Inability of a few to 
make the grade to return to school 
also has cut into the supply of first 
' class material. However, the coaches 
have been .blessed with the addition 
of several stellar players from last 
year’s freshman outfit-that will carry 
on in true Carnegie style.-
Football tickets for night students 
can be purchased on the three regis­
tration nights, October 6, 7. and 8 
at a price that represents a saving 
which will make it worth while 
for nigl^t students to purchase them.
The time is too distant to make 
any remarks concerning the winter 
athletics, basketball, boxing, wrestling, 
etc., but the Plaid will endeavor -to 
give first-hand information on these 
sports when the season is at hand.

It is with sincere regret the Plaid 
reports that James J. Lcindcckcr, 
President-clect of the Night- Student 
Council, has been ill 'for several 
months and the possibilities of his 
returning to school this fall are very 
remote. Air. Lcindcckcr was stricken 
with appendicitis early in June. 
After an operation and several 
weeks confinement in the hospital, 
he was removed to his home where 
he is still recuperating.

PARKING REGULATIONS
Rules to Be Observed and 
Obeyed
During the next couple of weeks 
the prospective night students will be 
reporting to the ^Administration office 
in preparation for registration in one 
of the various courses offered in the 
night terms, and it is at this time 
the Plaid wishes to stress the’ point 
of parking and the regulations on 
parking which are in force on the 
Campus. These regulations have been 
adopted as the best means 1 to safe­
guard all those who have occasion 
to use the campus. The rules which 
apply .are as follows:
No parking is permitted on the
Industries side of the drive paral­
leling Industries and Langcly Lab.
However, right angle to the curb 
parking is permitted on the Park 
side of this drive. Machines should 
be parked with the rear to the em­
bankment. They should also be park­
ed reasonably close together so that 
as large a. number as possible can 
be accommodated.
No parking is permitted on the
Quadrangle—nor between, barriers on 
this drive at any time. This rule 
must be observed.
No parking, is permitted on the
RUBBER STAMPS: It is recommended that each student pur­
chase a rubber name stamp like this specimen:
ALEXANDER, ARTHUR P.
Capital letters 3/16" in height. Secure the stamp, if possible, in 
advance of enrollment so that it can be used on the first regis­
tration blanks. A student signs his name about 350 times in 
official registration procedure in a four-year course. The stamp 
is also useful on laboratory reports and home work.One Line Stamps—50c Each—Mail Your Order

NIGHT REGISTRATION
It will soon be time for the night n 
students to register for the uext 
school year. The permit to register 
has been sent out to the students 
and a time set aside for each stu­
dent to register. These groups have 
been established in order to dis­
tribute the registration evenly and 
it is hoped that the returning stu­
dents will assist in relieving the 
congestion which is always in evi­
dence at registration time. The stu­
dents can materially aid in the regis­
tration by conforming to the regula­
tions established.
All the courses given at Carnegie 
arc the best obtainable anywhere and 
it is to the advantage oL each stu­
dent to return this fall in’ order fo 
complete the course he had previous­
ly registered for. No better oppor­
tunity is offered to anyone than, to 
register for some night course and 
then continue in the course until 
school closes in the spring. Many an 
advancement has been made possible
It is with regret that the Plaid 
announces the death of Frank La- 
Rosa during »the summer. Mr. La- 
Rosa was registered in the Night 
College of Fine Arts, the P. & D. 
Department. His many friends and 
the Plaid wish to take this oppor­
tunity. to express their sincere sym­
pathy to his family.

drive between the

Parking is permitted on both, sides 
of Woodlawn Avenue, and on both 
sides of Drive between Fine Arts 
Building and. the Gymnasium, Drive­
ways, however, are to be kept clear.
There must be no parking on Frew 
Street hill running up to Park Man­
sions. ANY CAR FOUND PARK­
ED ON THIS STREET WILL BE 
TOWED AWAY. Likewise, any car 
found parked over the yellow lines 
at the intcrscctioii of Woodlawn ave­
nue, Frew street, and the Park drive 
WILL ALSO BE TOWED AWAY.
No parking is permitted in front 
of the barrier at Margaret Morrison 
College.
By carefully observing these rules 
everyone will obtain a square deal 
and there will be no cause to com­
plain. It is hoped that the night stu­
dents will co-operate with the sciiool 
and the police department in their 
efforts to supply parking space. More 
stringent rules will have to be adopt­
ed if these are not complied with.

President’s Welcome
I am glad to have the opportunity which the editors of 
Carnegie Tartan have granted me to extend to you a word of 
welcome, and to offer my sincere good wishes for a success­
ful year at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Your en­
trance to college is probably the most important step that 
you have ever taken. I hope that your expectations and 
ambitions will be fully realized. We of the faculty feel that 
your success is our success, and that the reputation of Car­
negie grows in proportion to what its students accomplish. 
If you find difficulties in your work your instructors will be 
very glad, to help yoih I hope you Will feel that there is a 
spirit of friendliness here, and will make an effort to becoiric 
acquainted with the faculty. Please feel free to come to see 
me at any time to discuss your problems. Will you not 
do your share towards making this coming year the most 
successful in the history of Carnegie?
Thomas S. Baker, President.
Our New Dress
The Carnegie Tartan is starting on the second quarter 
of a century of its existence. During the first twenty-live 
years the paper has grown considerably in size and appear­
ance. This year we arc commemorating the start on a sec­
ond twenty-five years', by making numerous changes which 
we hope will make the paper more interesting from a typo­
graphical standpoint, as well as adding new features to at­
tract our readers.
The change in our banker appearing at the top of the 
lii'st page has been made with the hope of accentuating the 
fact that this is a paper portraying Carnegie's campus, and 
also to advertise the fine buildings which make up our 
campus. To Mr. Sterling of the Printing department we are 
indebted for considerable help and advice in designing this 
new banner.
Just a Word
To the Plcbes—The Tartan extends its welcome to the 
incoming students and wishes them luck on this most im­
portant adventure in education. The week of- concentrated 
effort to orientate the freshman has been concluded. The 
majority of newcofncrs are as yet quite bewildered and 
conscious of something which stamps them as a “green.” 
They need not feel discouraged, however, for they already 
have .the-foundation necessary for a member of,the Carnegie, 
clan. A conscientious program of study, sufficient initiative 
to secure friends, adaptability to our hospitable social life, 
and a development of class spirit under the freshman regula­
tions, are the requisites for the successful Carnegie man.
To the Sophs—The extent to which the freshmen will 
benefit by regulations is dependent upon the efficiency and 
interest displayed by the sophomores. No amount of brow­
beating will be beneficial to either'side. Rather a dignified 
maintenance of the rules with the proper moulding of'a new 
Carnegie man as the ¿bjective.
Remember with the period of regulations ending at 
Thanksgiving this year an intensive program is necessary.
NEWS FROM THE FILES
FACULTY MEMBERS RETURN
(Continued from Page One) 
Dean Green also visited at the In­
ternational Institute at Geneva and 
the Colonial Exposition in Paris, 
Professor Trinks visited Germany, 
Czechoslovakia, Luxe m b u r g, and 
France,, mainly for the purpose of 
studying the mechanical and furnace 
equipment of steel and glass works. 
In Paris he read the proofs of the 
sccond volume, of the French edition 
of his work on "Industrial Furnaccs" 
and remarks that it was "some job!” 
Over in Brno, Chechoslovakia, 
Professor Trinks inspected the pow- 
dcrcd-coal engines which are being 
manufactured under .the Pawlikam- 
sky patents by the Eiste Bruner. lie 
also visited a number of men who 
are to deliver papers before the Coal 
Conference this November.
Concerning his economical obser­
vations, Professor Trinks reports 
that in Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Lux­
emburg, and France industrial con­
ditions are fairly good, the mills 
running between sixty and seventy- 
five per cent of their capacity; in 
Germany, however, the employment 
is rather poor, the mills being down 
to about thirty per cent of their 
capacity, which is quite comparable 
to conditions in the United States.

(8) Freshmen- must not display 
any preparatory school insignia at 
any time while on the campus.
(9) All freshmen of the same 
sex must speak to all members of 
the same sex, including both upper­
classmen and freshmen,. while on

(10) All freshmen are required 
to wear the uniform identification 
badge at all times and in a con­

For the regulations for men, for

should memorize those provisions 
pertaining, to themselves.
WELCOME DANCE

vited. The -alumni are urged espe­
cially to help make the dance 
success by their presence.
Hello Carnegians!
The same old fence, just a new flock of buzzards 
on it. We’re glad to see everyone back and sorry for 
those who couldn't make it. Luck to them! We welcome 
the new and verdant mob of Plebes. • Looks like it 
would be quite a job for the Sophs to whip ’em into 
shape. Yas, suhl Here. is the scandal sheet. You 
make the dirt, we’ll sweep. Satisfaction guaranteed or 
purchased price cheerfully • refunded. Of course, the 
usual attempt will be made to remain anonymous 
‘cause heaven help us when we're discovered.* « * *
Classification of Insignia
Some( of the newcomers have made the natural 
mistake of thinking that the fellows wearing the 
funny .gob. hats with reptiles riding on them and the 
girls wearing those atrocious red skirts were Plcbes 
already in the grip' of those horrid regulations. No, 
gentle reader; those guys arc Dragons (tremble soitie- 
w.hat), the Senior honorary men/ and the girls so out- 
landislily dressed are Cwens (pronounced no one 
knows how), the Sophomore honorary women. Of 
course you could tell that the girls sporting Mortar 
Board emblems on their Facisti sweaters arc the 
Senior women who arc up and doing. The other im­
portant. organization on the campus, the Delta Skulls, 
Junior Men’s honorary, haven’t made enough money 
yet to purchase their cute little (links with nasty 
green skulls gracing them: There arc a few more
cults on the campus but you’ll learn about them soon, 
enough, especially the Sophomore Druids who 'think 
up trick things for the poor Plebes to do.* * * *
Ex-Editor’s Debut Delayed
Ex-Edi,tor-in-Chief :Jack\Boyle just couldn’t leave 
the dear old alma mater so is returning to dabble 
with a few classes and live the ljfe of a "college 
man.” His arrival has been .postponed somewhat by 
a little crackup from which lie emerged with a frac­
tured, patella, we arc sorry1 to hear. We can expect
a debut on crutches or in a wheel chair. Note: the 
patella is the knee cap.)* * * *
Caged
Our Jack Horning recently ..underwent a minor
operation (on his head) and in accordance with re­
cuperative measures must abstain from exposure to 
dark dank night air. 
Poor Jack -r- Little 
Jack Horner sat in 
a corner, watching 
the flight of Time, 
"Might ,as well to

said, just as the
clock struck nine.—

Plebe Crashes News
Freshman Samuel Dale Cooper crashed the Pitts­
burgh Sun Telegraph (for 'reference: Last Sunday’s
edition, Part 1. Page 14) with a 6 by 6 cut showing 
him "selecting” a dink. As if there was any sclcc- 
.tionl All me, how easy these newcomers get pub­
licity! A Senior would have to jump a bridge 
after a Math exam to rate his picture in the city 
news.
Pitt vs. Butterflies
Pitt Freshmen have been romping through our 
Schenley Park (our campus, by Handbook definition) 
scurrying after poor innocent butterflies. We have 
often thought things about the Pitt boys but never 
fancied that they could be reduced to butterfly chas­
ing. Perhaps if the bold hunters would conceal their 
bright orange dinks when sneaking up on a bevy of 
Anosia Plexippus or Papilio Turnus the aforemen­
tioned Anosia or PJexippus would be much less likely 
to take afright and lead the hunters such a merry 
chase over hill and dale. (We should talk about good 
looking dinks tho!)if * * *
Vagabond
Under the guise of a veteran hash lotcr from a 
New York restaurant, our genial Business Manager Ed 
St'diner, shipped before the mast of a Europe-bound 
liner as a waiter in the mess hall. Pie “did” western 
Europe on _a bicycle, sponging off the natives for me ?ls, 
sleeping in hay­
mows, and taking 
in all the sights that 
were free. The re­
port is that they 
have a pretty fair 
depression across 
the Big Pond but 
lack the excitement 
of bank failures be­
cause the people 
keep their hard earned francs, marks, lires, etc., in a 
sock in a hole in the wall. On the return trip Steiner’s 
disability as a waiter was uncovered and he was pro­
moted to dishwasher. Oui, some ; of the- stories he 
tells!
Plebes Cavort At Reception
At the Dean’s reception Mr, Tampa, magician, 
undid Saul Farbmann by discovering a supply of 
feminine unmentionables secreted in his sleeve. Saul 
is only a Freshman too! Tsk! Tsk!—Emerson Pres- 
scy lost a perfectly good dancing partner by falling 
for the old gag that she had to make a phone call,
A Mister Monroe was one of the victims of the hos­
tesses’ racket. One of the ravishing hostesses eased 
up to the above mentioned Freshman and sez coyly, 
"Would you like to dance?” As soon as he recovered 
sufficiently Mister Monroe breathed; "Yes, you bet!1 
The sly hostess, with a "hand is quicker than the 
eye’’ movement, produced one of the usual run of 
Fresh women and hurling her into the outstretched 
arms' of the gigolo quickly slunk away searching for 
another victim.—Gertrude Landis craftily suggested 
to Mister Grishaber that perhaps he could find some­
one else to dancc with. Mister Grishaber carefully 
surveyed the mob with his eyes shut and announced 
that lie’ .couldn’t find anyone else and dashed off 
with Gcrt again. Clever chap!—Frank Kulas vowed 
death and destruction to the agent who cut in on him 
but postponed the gory deed because lie didn’t want 
to spoil the reception with a scene.. My, how fierce 
these new men are!—No, Dean, we weren’t there. 
This dope came from one of our trusty spies;”
Cheerio!

No matter how green the fresh­

An Asset to College 
Students
Colhgo men and women,
accustomcd to regulating 
their own expenditures and 
planning, their own budgets 
are receiving valuable train­
ing in handling money that 
will prove beneficial in after­
life. In this connection, a 
bank account 'is an impor­
tant asset to people of col­
lege age. The Mellon Na­
tional Bank is always glad 
to receive the accounts of 
college students.
Mellon National Bank
He "got by" for years
^without a good pen
—but what a price he paid!
Behind the courteous consent, there 
frequently smolders an aversion to 
lending one’s pen. “Since ho borrowed 
mine, it. has never been the same,” is 
often said, but NOT of Parker Duo­
fold. For hero is i\ point no hand can 
distort. Yet it; writes as easily as you 
breathe—with amazing Prcssureless 
Touch. o
So bo careful not to borrow any 
other pen—avoid tho risk of becoming 
unpopular. Better yet, stop at the 
nearest, pen counter and pick up a 
Parker Duofold. Then you won’t cre­
ate ill will by borrowing. And you can
gain good will by lending graciously.
You’ll find other pens which are 
priced 50% higher than the Parker 
Duofold Jr. or Lady Duofold at $5 
yet with 22% to 69% less ink capacity. 
You won’t find any with Parker’s 
stylish streamlined shape, jewel-like 
color range, Invisible Filler, and Pat­
ented Clip, which holds the pen (or 
pencil) low and unexposed.

ing comparison of value that is winning 
new thousands to Parker every day.

TELEPHONE
Date with Home
O-fSFNFDt $ oi1 for Freshman! Now 
h-lltl you’re at college, you can al- 
. ways “go home by telephone.” 
Regularly, or whenever you like, give Mother 
and Dad a call.
Tonight, for instance, pay them a “voice visit.” 
Tell them how you're settling down- What a 
thrill they’ll have to hear your voice—and 
maybe you won’t enjoy it, too!
But, best of all, arrange to call home each 
week. That’s a joy they’ll look forward to as 
much as you.
FOR THE LOWEST COST 
AND GREATEST EASE
Set your “date” for after 8.30 P. M. and take ad­
vantage of the low Night Rates. (A dollar call is 
60c at night; a 50c call is 35c.)
By making, a date the folks will be at home. Thus 
you can make a Station to Station call rather than 
a more expensive Person to Person call.
Just give the operator your home telephone num­
ber. If you like, the charges can be reversed I
