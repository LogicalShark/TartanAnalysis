Students expose landlords
By MATT BUSHEY
Tartan Asst. News Editor
A couple who owns hundreds of apartments in the 
CMU and Pitt area is unfairly charging students for 
false damages, according to two CMU students and 
a number of Pitt students who have lodged com­
plaints.
One of the Pitt students is Karen Freeman, a fifth 
year pharmacy major at the University of Pitts­
burgh. She lived in a Louisa Street apartment for a 
year and experienced many problems with her land­
lords, Nick and Calliope Kavalieratos.
“She kept the majority of our security deposit,” 
said Freeman, referring to Calliope “Poppy” 
Kavalieratos, her landlord when she lived at Uni­
versity Apartments. “She charged us for stuff that 
was already broken.” According to Freeman, she 
was charged for damages she didn’t incur and for 
items which the landlords purchased for the apart­
ment but never gave to Freeman.
“I do not know a single person [who lived in the 
apartment building] that she did not rip off,” said 
Freeman.
Dustin Osborne, a sophomore at the University of 
Pittsburgh, was also charged for many things which 
he feels are not his responsibility. “She had my 
security deposit and she wanted extra,” said Osborne. 
According to Osborne, his charges included sham­
pooing the carpet, cleaning the walls, two mattress 
covers for one bed, and a hole in the couch which was 
there when he moved in. “It was just really terrible,”
he said.
“I know several other people who she took money 
from,” said Osborne, including one student who was 
charged $300 to paint one wall.
“The amounts are staggering,” said one CMU stu­
dent who wishes to remain anonymous. According to 
the student, others have been charged with bills in 
the range of $2,000 and $3,000. He believes the 
confession of judgement within the lease is “particu­
larly targeted at. students,” who like him, are not 
aware of the implications of the clause. “It is very 
likely that many other landlords are using it too,” he 
said.
Tony Miccarelli, a junior criminal justice major at 
the University of Pittsburgh, believes he got off easy. 
“We were one of the lucky ones,” he said. Miccarelli 
had only a portion of his security deposit withheld by 
the Kavalieratos. “Our parents scrubbed the place.... 
We left that place immaculate, and they charged us 
$60 for cleaning,” he said. “Everyone we know of got 
most of [the security deposit] taken.”
According to Miccarelli, different tenants are 
charged each year for the repair of the same things. 
Miccarelli remembers when he lived in the apart­
ment and the previous tenants came by to ask if 
things they had paid for had been fixed. “We said 
‘no.’”
Miccarelli believes they will continue to cheat stu­
dents unless some action is taken. “They [the ten­
ants] don’t try and fight it because they don’t know 
the proper channels,” said Miccarelli. “People don’t

Pitt Philosophy club bans gays, lesbians, and bisexuals
By NATHAN FULLERTON
Tartan News Editor
The University of Pittsburgh’s 
Philosophy Club has decided to 
deny membership to all gays, 
lesbians, and bisexuals in re­
sponse to Chancellor J. Dennis 
O’Connor’s recent refusal to 
eliminate Pitt’s ROTC program 
despite its discriminatory poli­
cies.
“This isn’t a protest, it isn’t 
symbolic. This is real,” says Phi­
losophy Club Vice President
Dave Snyder. “O’Connor has 
given us a license to discrimi­
nate.”
The policy met with no resis­
tance from other members of the 
Philosophy Club. “The question 
isn’t ‘why did we decide to ban 
homosexuals?’ The question is 
‘why do we have to have them?’ 
” said Snyder. “We had the best 
interests of the club at heart. 
Their political agenda is not con­
ducive to our group.”
“They may seem like frivolous 
reasons, but the DoD has a simi­
lar policy,” said Doug Eyer, 
President of the Philosophy 
Club. “It’s the same kind of policy 
they used to keep blacks out. It 
is stupid.”
“We don’t have to have good 
reasons,” said Snyder. “O’Con­
nor opened the window.... He’s a 
fool if he thought something like 
this wasn’t going to happen.” 
Pitt’s Student Government 
Board does not allow recognized 
organizations to discriminate. 
Jacob Brody, president pro- 
tempore of the board, has prom­
ised action against any student 
organization that discriminates. 
“It’s within our power to remove 
their funding and recognition. 
We’ll stand by our non-discrimi­
nation policy,” he said.
Brody, who opposes Chancel­
lor O’Connor’s decision to con­
tinue Pitt’s ROTC program, dis­
agrees with Snyder’s method of 
addressing this issue. “There are 
plenty of alternatives. We will 
not compromise our principles 
against discrimination.”
The University of Pittsburgh
Pre-Law Society, of which 
Snyder is president, is also con­
sidering such a ban, but there is 
much controversy within the 
group.
Carmen Cristini, the Pre-Law 
Club’s publicity secretary, is 
strongly opposed to the idea. “I 
do not want to have a club affili­
ated with this policy,” she said. 
“We’re here for law purposes.... 
[This is] basically a one-man 
initiative.”
“We have different opinions 
here,” said Pre-Law Society
Business Manager Chris Orie, 
who opposed the policy. “This 
thing is not finished.” Orie also 
said, “Student Affairs has made 
it abundantly clear that action 
will be taken if we go through 
with this policy.”
“No one has ever fought sexual 
orientation discrimination on 
this campus. I think it will be 
interesting to see what hap­
pens,” said Matthew Kittridge, 
business manager of BiGALA, 
Pitt’s gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
group.
CMU officials subpoenaed for trial
By JASON MCDONALD
Tartan Assistant News Editor
In a step toward a complete elec­
tronic library, the ultimate goal of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Project Mer- 
cury, the Library Information Sys­
tem II (LIS II) was officially intro­
duced on February 24. LIS II, de­
veloped as a part of Project Mer­
cury, is CMU’s local implementa­
tion of the Project Mercury Soft­
ware.
The goal of ProjectMercury is to 
provide users on-line access to 
entire publications, including 
graphics that were previously im­
possible to show. “This is the first 
step in enabling libraries across 
the world to talk to one another
and share information,” said 
Thomas Dopirak, technical di­
rector of Project Mercury.
Mercury differs from other 
computer-based library systems 
in that it is based on distributed 
computing — information is 
stored on several serversinstead 
of on a single mainframe. Ac­
cording to Vice President for 
Academic Services William 
Arms, there are definite advan­
tages to a distributed system. 
“Because the system is distrib­
uted,” he said, “we can use the 
most cost-effective equipment 
and have the potential for un­
limited growth.”
Other important advantages 
of LIS II and Mercury are the
use of standard formats and the 
addition of multiple user inter­
faces, which will allow users :to 
access the system from almost 
any computer on campus. The 
adherence to standard formats 
will make it easier for future 
systems to interface with Mer­
cury.
One of the important goals of 
LIS II is to gain acceptance for 
Mercury from the campus com­
munity through everyday use. 
However, it remains to be seen 
whether Mercury can pass this 
particular test. Complaints 
about speed, limitations of the 
system, and bugs in the system 
have appeared on several elec-

President Mehrabian was subpoenaed 
last week to appear before a magistrate 
for testimony today. He and four others 
received subpoenas last Thursday for the 
current court case against VincentEirene, 
Cassandra Geier, and Glenn Grodin.
The three were charged with defiant 
trespass after they were arrested at the 
Software Engineering Institute (SEI) on 
February 13 while protesting CMU’s al­
leged involvement with U.S. military 
during the Gulf War.
The demonstration marked the first 
anniversary of the bombing of the 
Ameriya shelter in Iraq. Bombs allegedly 
based on technology developed at SEI 
killed 317 people identified as civilians.
The defendants have pleaded not guilty, 
arguing the Necessity Defense, which 
allows an individual to commit a crime to 
prevent a greater crime. “[We used] civil 
disobedience as a way to point out the 
greater injustice,” said Eirene. If found 
guilty, Eirene and the others may have to 
serve up to 90 days in jail or pay fines up 
to $300.
Through testimony by Mehrabian, 
Druffel, Habermann, and Adams, Eirene 
hopes to firmly establish a link between 
CMU and the military. “We need to show 
we had the privilege [to protest] — that 
we have reason to believe there is a 
connection between SEI and the Persian 
Gulf War.”
On Thursday, Eirene and Grodin at­
tempted to deliver the subpoenas per­
sonally to all five recipients, despite a 
policy that all legal papers involving fac­
ulty or staff áre to be delivered through 
Campus Police. After attempts to locate 
the recipients failed, Eirene and Grodin 
were forced to deliver the subpoenas 
through LaPaglia, who accepted them on 
behalf of all parties.
The subpoenas have requested atten­
dance on Monday, but Eirene says that 
his previous attempts to subpoena high- 
ranking administrators have been 
“quashed by campus lawyers.” 
“University attorneys took measures 
to avoid [former president] Cyert’s hav­
ing to appear in court,” said LaPaglia. “It 
used to be the demonstration of the 
month, now it’s the demonstration of the

“I can’t see them using the necessity 
defense,” Said Director of Security James 
LaPaglia. “It will be interesting.”
The subpoenas were issued for 
Mehrabian and four others — LaPaglia; 
Larry Druffel, director of SEI; and Pro­
fessor Nico Habermann and Associate 
Dean for Research Duane Adams, both 
from the Department of Computer Sci­
ence.

House report urges a budget fix
WASHINGTON, March 5 (DJ) — 
House Democrats warned that the fed­
eral budget may be overwhelmed by an 
explosion of new borrowing and inter­
est payments in the 1990s. The re­
proach, however, suggests that efforts 
to balance the budget should be de­
ferred until the economy improves.
In a report accompanying the pro­
posed fiscal 1993 budget, the House 
Budget Committee said the rising tide 
of federal debt threatens to dampen 
long-term U.S. economic growth.
The Democratic budget, expected to 
be approved last Thursday, projects a 
deficit of $331.3 billion in fiscal 1993, 
which begins October 1, and provides 
for a total debt limit of $4,477 trillion.
In the coming year the U.S. is pro­
jected to spend $213.9 billion servicing 
its debt, the third largest government 
expenditure behind the Pentagon and 
Social Security.
By fiscal 1997, the debt limit is pro­
jected to reach $5,969 trillion.
“Unless we can reduce the deficit’s 
likely path, the federal budget could be 
on its way to a ‘debt explosion’ — a 
never-ending and self-reinforcing in­
crease in debt and interest payments,” 
the report says.
The report cites the accelerating 
growth of accumulated debt and inter­
est costs as a “vicious cycle.”
“The longer the cycle is allowed to 
continue, the more painful the steps 
needed to stop it,” the report says. “And 
lacking the political will to cut the 
buildup of the debt through lower spend­
ing and higher taxes, the only remedy 
is a rapid inflation to depreciate the 
outstanding debt.
“While this eventuality seems far­
fetched — it is hard to imagine the 
United States resorting to 
hyperinflation as a policy tool — this 
very problem has befallen other na­
tions whose financial integrity was at 
one time as unquestioned as this 
country’s,” the report says.
Despite the dark admonitions, the 
Budget Committee report insists that 
cutting the deficit now could under­
mine the modest economic recovery fore­
casted for this year.
The report says early in 1993, when 
economic growth is projected to be firmly 
established and the presidential elec­
tion is over, Congress and the White 
House should again put the deficit atop 
the political agenda.
Among the highest priorities, the re­
port says, will be curbing the growth of 
mandatory spending, including such 
programs as Medicare and Medicaid, 
which are the fastest growing accounts 
in the budget.
“In the meantime,” the report con­
cludes, “Congress, the President and 
the Federal Reserve must remain ex­
tremely alert to any new signs of a 
faltering recovery and be willing to act 
to alleviate the human misery and com­
munity disruption of a stagnant 
economy.”
U.S. and Russian officials 
discuss weapon control
MOSCOW, March 6 (AP) — A U.S. 
Senate delegation led by Armed 
Forces Committee Chairman Sam 
Nunn opened talks Friday on con­
verting Russian defense plants to ci­
vilian uses and dismantling the So­
viet nuclear arsenal.
The delegation is scheduled to meet 
senior government officials in Rus­
sia, Ukraine, and Belarus, three of 
the four republics currently in 
possesion of strategic nuclear weap­
ons.
Nunn, (D-Ga.), praised Ukraine’s 
pledge to transfer all of its nuclear 
weapons to Russia for dismantling by 
July. Ukraine aims to become a 
nuclear-free country.
Ideally, other members of the Com­
monwealth of Independent States will 
follow suit.
“It’s our understanding that
Ukraine has no intent of retaining 
nuclear weapons, and we are inter­
ested in how that disarmament is 
being carried out,” Nunn told report­
ers after arriving at Moscow’s 
Sheremetyevo Airport.
“We are very encouraged by the 
pledges that have been made by 
Ukraine.”
Nunn said the delegation also 
wants to work with republics to avoid 
proliferation of nuclear, chemical, 
and other high-technology weapons. 
He said the Senators were inter­
ested the very prevalent issue of how 
Commonwealth of Independent 
States members were centralizing 
control over their tactical and nuclear 
weapons.
Nunn said the delegation also has 
high hopes for encouraging democ­
racy and free-market reforms.
Azerbaijani rebellion flares
AGDAM, Azerbaijan, 
March 6 (AP) — Azerbaijan 
launched a fierce offensive 
against Armenian villages in 
the disputed region of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, seizing 
and burning a village not far 
from the site of an alleged 
massacre by Armenia last 
week, news reports said.
In the Azerbaijani capital 
of Baku, meanwhile, thou­
sands of protesters sur­
rounded the parliament, pre­
venting lawmakers from leav­
ing the building and demanding 
President Ayaz MutaliboVs res­
ignation, witnesses said.
The ITAR-Tass news agency, 
citing Armenian sources, said 
the Armenian village of Kaz- 
anchi was seized and burned 
overnight, with 27 people known 
killed and about 100 missing.
Other Armenian villages and 
towns were attacked in eastern
Nagorno-Karabakh, not far 
from the Azerbaijani town of 
Khodzhali, ITAR-Tass said. It 
was there that Azerbaijan said 
Armenia massacred at least
1,000 Azerbaijanis on Feb. 25.
There was no way to verify 
the number of dead or the size 
of the attacks in Nagorno- 
Karabakh, the mountainous 
enclave claimed by both Chris­
tian Armenia and Muslim 
Azerbaijan.
Court upholds abortion decision:Insurance coverage on abortions now restricted
Bush vetoes new MFN terms
ST. LOUIS, March 2 (AP) — A federal appeals 
court upheld a state law restricting insurance 
coverage for elective abortions. The 8th U.S. Cir­
cuit Court of Appeals struck down a decision by 
U.S. District Court in Kansas City that found the 
law an unconstitutional infringement of a woman’s 
right to an abortion.
The unanimous ruling concerns a 1983 state 
law barring elective abortion from routine health 
insurance policies issued in the state, allowing it 
only as an option at additional cost. This is a result 
of the already existing abortion controversy.
The law defined elective abortionas a procedure 
to end a pregnancy other than the body’s sponta­
neous abortion or to save the mother’s life.
The stated reasons for the law were reducing 
health insurance costs and guarding the interests
of consumers who object to indirectly helping pay 
for abortions through their own insurance premi­
ums.
The law was challenged by a woman identified 
as Jane Coe. She didn’t carry the additional abor­
tion coverage and when her insurance company 
refused to pay for the abortion, she sued on grounds 
that the Missouri insurance restriction was un­
constitutional.
The lower court ruled that since pregnancy is 
more costly than abortion, payment of the extra 
premium would actually subsidize child birth, not 
the other way around.
The appeals court found the woman had showed 
no evidence that insurance policies covering elec­
tive abortions are unavailable or prohibitively 
expensive.
WASHINGTON, March 2 (DJ) — President 
Bush vetoed, as promised, a bill that would have 
placed additional conditions on renewal of China’s 
most-favored-nation (MFN) status, which expires 
after July 3,1992.
In his veto message, Bush said that “conditional 
MFN status would severely damage the Western- 
oriented, modernizing elements in China, weaken 
Hong Kong, and strengthen opposition to democ­
racy and economic reform.”
The bill, passed by Congress last week, would 
have required Bush to certify that China made 
progress on respect for human rights, cooperation 
in arms control, and dropped trade barriers before 
renewing MFN status for another year.
'There is no doubt in my mind that if we present 
China’s leaders with an ultimatum on MFN, the 
result will be weakened ties to the West and 
further repression,” said Bush.
‘The end result will not be progress on human
rights, arms control, or trade. Anyone familiar 
with recent Chinese history can attest that the 
most brutal and protracted periods of repression 
took place precisely when China turned inward, 
against the world,” he wrote.
Bush’s veto likely won’t be overridden by Con­
gress since the MFN bill passed with less than a 
two-thirds majority required to force enactment 
over White House objections.
Bush cited several recent moves on human 
rights and weapons proliferation to justify his 
opposition to new trade curbs on Beijing.
“Recent agreements by the Chinese to protect 
U.S. intellectual property rights, to abide by the 
Missile Technology Control Regime Guidelines, 
to accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
by April, and to discuss our human rights con­
cerns — after years of stonewalling — are the 
clear achievements of my administration’s policy 
of comprehensive engagement,” Bush said.
Saudis favor plan to oust Saddam
NICOSIA, March 4 (AP) — A 
key Iraqi opposition leader said 
that Saudi officials have given a 
favorable response to a plan for 
toppling Iraqi leader Saddam 
Hussein, Tehran radio reported.
In Iraq, the defense minister 
urged the armed forces to “re­
main vigilant against traitors," 
a usual reference to Kurdish and 
Shiite Muslim factions which 
have been struggling to over­
throw the government since 
Iraq’s Gulf War defeat last year.
Ayatollah Mohammed al- 
Hakim, head of the opposition 
Supreme Assembly of the Is­
lamic Revolution of Iraq, said 
that while on a visit to Saudi 
Arabia last week, he presented 
a five-point plan to overthrow 
Saddam.
It drew “favorable promises 
about its implementation,” from 
both Saudi officials and Iraqi 
exiles, mainly army deserters, 
Tehran Radio quoted him as tell­
ing a news conference. He did 
not elaborate on the plan.
Asked if he would cooperate 
with an American scheme to 
overthrow Saddam, Hakim said, 
“Until now, no such plan been 
given to this assembly.”
Last month, officials in Wash­
ington said President Bush had 
authorized an increase in covert 
activity to topple Saddam. The 
disclosure coincided with a visit 
to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Is­
rael by Central Intelligence 
Agency director Robert Gates.
Hakim’s group is backed by 
Iran and Syria, which share long 
borders with Iraq.

Know your rights as a tenant
By PAUL PLATOSH
fartan Junior Staffwriter
Under Pennsylvania law, 
landlords have limited power to 
collect rents and to recover com­
pensation for damages. Under 
the right of Peaceful Possession, 
landlords can not harass a ten­
ant for overdue rent. The result 
is that they protect themselves 
through the lease.
Many leases contain clauses 
landlords add that give them 
special power when the tenant 
signs the lease. A1 Brannick, 
Carnegie Mellon University’s se­
nior vice president for legal af­
fairs, said, “Landlords have their 
problems, and they will try to 
protect themselves.” Often, stu­
dents who move off campus end 
up in disputes with their, land­
lords. These disputes can be 
avoided if the tenant thinks
things through and follows a few 
simple rules.
“The greatest problems occur 
because of lack of communica­
tion, of not comprehending [the 
tenant’s] rights and responsi­
bilities,” says Norma Shaw of 
the off-campus housing office. 
These items are outlined in the 
lease. When a tenant is moving 
into an apartment, he or she 
should fully understand the 
terms of the lease. According to 
Shaw, a good lease should have 
three things — printing in a size 
that you can read; only English, 
no Latin phrases; and language 
that is easy to understand.
“You should be able to figure 
out what [the lease] means,” 
Shaw said. Some leases contain 
a special clause, the confession 
of judgement. This clause en­
ables the landlord to receive com­
pensation for any damages to
the apartment under your ten­
ure without allowing you to dis­
pute the fees or defend yourself 
before the judgement against 
you is made. “I would tell you 
not to sign a lease with this 
clause in it,” Brannick said.
Security deposits are another 
bone of contention among ten­
ants and landlords. No matter 
how much you clean, the land­
lord is perfectly entitled to use 
that money to paint and clean 
the apartment. The best way to 
avoid these disputes is to ask 
the landlord what has been done 
to the apartment before you 
move in. This will give you a 
good idea what you will be 
charged for when you move out.
Another good thing to do is to 
take pictures of any damage that 
the apartment has, make sure 
the landlord is aware of them, 
and have the damages listed in-
dividually on the lease itself. 
“Certainly, a person movinginto 
an apartment ought to look it 
over with a fine tooth comb, and 
if any damages are present, both 
parties should be aware of them,” 
Brannick said.
Renting from a landlord who 
lives far away may be unwise, as 
it may lead to problems with 
maintainance and repairs. Also, 
tenants with roommates should 
be aware of the consequences if 
one roommate fails to make a 
rent payment.
All the landlord’s require­
ments should be plainly spelled 
out in the lease, and any tenant 
or prospective tenant who has 
trouble understanding his or her 
lease should seek legal counsel.
Brannick is considering hold­
ing a seminar on the legal as­
pects of off-campus housing 
sometime in the future.
Oakland landlords bilk unwary students
HOUSING PROBLEMS, from page 1
know their way around the 
courts.... The landlords in Oak­
land do, because they’re making 
their living off of it.”
The actions of the landlord are 
legal because of a clause in the 
lease signed by both parties 
known as a confession of judge­
ment, which gives the landlord 
the power to enforce his or her 
claim in court automatically, 
simply by filing 
the judgement 
with the
prothonotary’s of­
fice. The protho- 
notaryisthe clerk 
of the Common 
Pleas court of Al­
legheny County.
In some cases, 
landlords are able 
to charge dam­
ages without even 
proving that the 
damages exist.
“[A landlord] 
can walk in, 
present this [con­
fession of judge­
ment] to the pro- 
thonotary, and it 
gives the protho- 
notary the right to pass judge­
ment against this person,” said 
A1 Brannick, senior vice presi­
dent for Legal Affairs. “It works 
the same way as if [the landlord] 
had filed suit against him or 
her.”
Another CMU student is cur­
rently involved in legal proceed­
ings with the Kavalieratos in an 
attempt to recover money they 
retained upon the termination 
of his lease. The student, who 
wishes to remain anonymous, 
has also had his bank accounts 
frozen. He has already expended 
$230 through court and attor­
ney costs, has not received his 
security deposit, and his bank 
accounts remain frozen. “The 
legal proceedings are mon­
strous,” he says.
There’s a “very good chance 
this clause will exist in [current] 
leases,” says the student, who 
did not realize the implications 
of the lease he signed.
The Carnegie Mellon student 
received a list of damages from 
his landlord that was, he alleges, 
“blatantly crazy.” He has ap­
peared in district court numer­
ous times to argue for his money. 
However, according to the stu­
dent, the Kavalieratos ap­
proached the prothonotary with
the list of damages and the 
signed confession of judgement. 
A hearing was then held and a 
judgement passed without the 
defendant present. The student 
is in the process of revoking the 
judgement, but considers it “a 
hell of a procedure.”
According to Calliope 
Kavalieratos, “Landlords always 
get attacked by tenants.” Con­
cerning the. recent complaints
confession of judgement which 
fails to protect their rights.
Named as the defendants in 
the suit were Prothonotary John 
Joyce, Sheriff Eugene Coon, U.S. 
Lumber of Squirrel Hill, and 
Nick and Calliope Kavalieratos 
of Bloomfield.
Two CMU students contacted 
the off-campus housing office 
shortly after, concerning simi­
lar problems they had with the
made about her withholding of 
security deposits and damage 
claims, she said, “Maybe, just 
maybe, everything is false.”
Kavalieratos refused to com­
ment any further.
The Kavalieratos were re­
moved from the off-campus hous­
ing list two years ago when 
Norma Shaw, the community 
housing coordinator, read two 
articles in The Pittsburgh Press 
and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
on the lease being used by 
Kavalieratos. “I was very sur­
prised,” said Shaw. “I saw it in 
both the daily papers.”
According to the articles 
printed by the Post Gazette and 
the Press on September14,1989, 
the Neighborhood Legal Service 
Association (NLS) filed suit with 
the Common Pleas Court, claim­
ing that Pennsylvania court 
rules allow creditors to victim­
ize consumers and tenants by 
the use of a confession of judge­
ment.
Charlene Lewis, a 62-year-old 
cleaning woman, and Odessa 
Robinson, a 59-year-old 
homeowner, were involved in 
two cases described by the NLS 
lawsuit who are among “liter­
ally thousands” of low-income 
people who are affected by a
Kavalieratos. “These people had 
frozen their bank accounts,” said 
Shaw. “It was unconventional 
maybe, but it was entirely le­
gal.”
According to Shaw, 
Kavalieratos told her that she 
had gotten ripped off by stu­
dents so many times from dam­
ages that she decided to include 
the clause in her leases. “I can 
believe Poppy that these things 
are happening to her,” said 
Shaw.
However, Shaw believes stu­
dents should be able to trust the 
housing office as a reliable source 
of off-campus housing informa­
tion. “So I just removed it [from 
my list],” said Shaw. “They’re 
not going to be led to her through 
my list.”
In an off-campus housing com­
plaint form filed with the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh housing 
office in 1989, Julie Huddleston 
said “During our lease many 
needed repairs were not made... 
also, they withheld money from 
our security deposit for items 
that they claim they replace each 
year.
However, those items were not 
in the apartments as new or we 
bought them at [our] own cost.
They also denied re­
ceiving a key de­
posit, even though 
one tenant has a 
cancelled check 
with‘key deposit’ in 
the memo.”
Ingrid Mesa, Cat 
Borowski, and 
Chris and Joe 
Lodge also filed a 
complaint with the 
Pitt housing office. 
“We have taken her 
to court in an at­
tempt to get back 
our security depos­
its,” they said in the 
complaint. “They 
take advantage of 
tenants.”
“The tenant has 
a right to sue the landlord if the 
landlord claims damages that 
the tenant considers unfair,” said 
Brannick. According to 
Brannick, the tenant has thirty 
days to appeal the confession of 
judgement “to file an exemption 
to exempt property from the 
notice and at the same time seek 
a rule to show why the confes­
sion of judgement shouldn’t be 
open to provide defense.” 
Tenants have specific rights 
listed under the Pennsylvania 
Landlord and Tenant Act, said 
Brannick, and the court process 
to retrieve a tenant’s deposit is 
“not insurmountable.”
Brannick nonetheless advises 
against leases which contain a 
confession of judgement,- and 
advises students, “Don’t ever 
sign one of these.”
Commission task forces reviewed
By MIKE LIPPERT
Tartan Personnel Manager
On February 27, the Com­
mission on Undergraduate 
Education held its second 
general meeting of the year 
to announce newly initiated 
studies and programs, and 
review the midyear progress 
of its standing task forces.
Dr. Erwin Steinberg, vice 
provost for Undergraduate 
Education and Commission 
chair, opened the meeting by 
reporting a series of studies 
intended to give better un­
derstanding of Carnegie 
Mellon’s perceived strengths 
and weaknesses in under­
graduate education. Univer­
sity President Robert 
Mehrabian has commis­
sioned the firm Siegel and 
Gale to evaluate how CMU is 
perceived and valued by po­
tential applicants and other 
individuals outside the uni­
versity.
Additionally, University 
Planning has initiated two 
studies. The first, an analy­
sis of the University’s diffi­
culties with student reten­
tion, will survey all students 
who entered the University 
in the fall of1990 and left the 
following semester. The other 
study will place additional 
questions on this semester’s 
faculty course evaluations 
(FCE) about students’ per­
ceptions of the work load in 
order to provide more focus 
for possible studies of the
topic.
Student Affairs has begun 
to provide several outlets for 
students to discuss campus 
problems with faculty and 
administration, including the 
Gathering Storr program in 
conjunction with Student 
Senate and special student/ 
faculty lunches.
Steven Calvert, director of 
Alumni Relations, is continu­
ing to develop a university- 
wide alumni mentor pro­
gram.
Barbara Lazarus, associate 
provost for Academic 
Projects, and Lawrence 
Thacker, director of Interna­
tional Education, are work­
ing in conjunction with stu­
dents to improve the oppor­
tunities provided by the CMU 
Centre de Tours.
The English Department 
has already revised and in­
stalled a new freshman writ- 
' ing program. English profes­
sor Richard Young has pro­
posed a Writing Across the 
Curriculum (WAC) program, 
in which students and fac­
ulty are taught to use and 
develop English skills in their 
particular disciplines. Addi­
tionally, an electronic and/or 
walk-in Writing Center is 
under development in tan­
dem with the freshman writ­
ing and WAC programs to 
improve student writing.
Three new task forces were 
also announced: Technology 
in Support of Education,

Crime and Incident Report
2/21 THEFT, 11:29 am. Traf­
fic monitors reported that when 
they had left work the previous 
day, there were no parking 
meters missing from the Skibo 
lot. When they returned, two 
poles and the meters were gone. 
The value of the meters and the 
poles is estimated to be approxi­
mately $900. No other damage 
was reported.
2/21 PROPERTY DAMAGE,
8:31 pm. A complaint was re­
ported to Campus Police that a 
window was broken in Grey 
Matter, on the patio side. The 
window was ground level and 
approximately one foot by four 
feet. The person who broke the 
window was not seen, but the 
complainant did notice a group 
of skateboarders on the patio 
just before the incident. The re­
sponding officers covered the 
broken window with cardboard 
and tape and a maintenence re­
quest was submitted.
2/21 SUSPICIOUS PER­
SON, 9:14 pm. An anonymous 
complainant reported to Cam­
pus Police that there was an 
individual throwing rocks at 
Doherty Hall and acting crazy. 
The person was described as a 
middle-aged white male wear­
ing a tan jacket and black hat. 
He was last seen walking to­
ward Forbes Avenue. The man 
was stopped by two CMU offic­
ers. He told them that he was 
; cutting across campus from 
; Schenley Park to Forbes Avenue 
I when a young white male wear- 
! ing a green jacket called him a 
“fuckingfaggot,” and approached 
him. The man admitted that he 
threw a brick at the individual, 
but only because he was called a 
“faggot.” The individual has no 
CMU affiliation, and was re­
leased with a warning because 
the complainant was anony­
mous. A check of Doherty Hall 
revealed no exterior damage.
2/23 INCIDENT, 8:43 am. 
While on patrol, an officer no­
ticed a desktop phone that be­
longed to a CMU student’s room 
sitting on the student’s drafting 
table in the CFA 2nd floor stu­
dio. The phone had been spliced 
into the studio phone approxi­
mately 25 feet away. According 
to another student, the student 
had spliced the phone into the 
main phone so that he didn’t 
have to get up from his desk to 
answer the phone while he was 
working.
2/23 MEDICAL ESCORT,
9:10 am. A CMU student re­
quested transport to the hospi­
tal because of a swollen right 
knee. The student was mysti­
fied by the swelling, because he 
could recall nothing that would 
have caused such an injury. He 
was transported to Presbyterian 
Hospital.
2/23 INSTITUTIONAL 
VANDALISM, 4 pm. Complain­
ant reported that an unknown 
person or persons had spread 
what appeared to be human fe­
ces on the bulletin board just 
inside the entrance to Porter 
Hall, first floor. The ABM custo­
dial supervisor was notified for 
clean up.
2/24 CRIMINAL MIS­
CHIEF, 12:31 am. A complain­
ant entered the Campus Police 
station and said that he would 
like to file a report about dam­
age to his 1988 red Subaru five- 
door station wagon. He said he 
had left the vehicle at a parking 
meter on Frew Street Extension. 
When he returned to the ve­
hicle, both side-view mirrors 
were turned toward the vehicle, 
and the antenna was bent in a 
couple of circles. On attempting 
to adjust the driver’s side mir­
ror, he found that the hinge was 
broken. The victim suspected 
that the damage was done in 
retaliation for an altercation he 
had been involved in, as the vic­
tim had seen the suspect’s car 
near GSIA when he parked. The 
victim was advised to file a re­
port with the city and to see a 
magistrate about filing a com­
plaint against the suspect.
2/24 INSTITUTIONAL 
VANDALISM, 8:07 am. Park­
ing personnel reported that un­
known persons vandalized and 
stole parking meters located in 
the Skibo lot. The vandals ap­
parently used force to rock the 
meter and pole units loose from 
their cement bases. One double­
headed and one single-headed 
meter were stolen. Three double­
headed meters were pulled from 
the ground and were found lay­
ing near their original positions. 
The stolen meter heads were 
valued at $385 each. The coins 
from the meters had been re­
moved recently, so the amount 
in the meter banks was mini­
mal.
2/24 MEDICAL ESCORT,
8:30 am. A student working in 
Hunt Library began to feel light­
headed and dizzy. The next thing 
she remembered was waking up
sitting on the floor, where she 
had passed out. The student com­
plained of pain in her right shoul­
der. Medics were notified and 
she was transported to Central 
Medical Hospital.
2/24 MEDICAL, 11:21 am. 
While descending the steps of a 
trailer outside Porter Hall, a 
CMU student slipped and fell, 
injuring her left knee. When of­
ficers arrived, the student was 
sitting at a desk with her leg 
elevated and ice on it. The steps 
were wet with rain and mud and 
were tilted forward. The stu­
dent refused transportation to a 
medical facility.
2/24 THEFT, 2 pm. A CMU
student reported that someone 
removed his charcoal drawing, 
on display with other art pieces 
on the third floor of CFA. The 
drawing is black and white. It is 
approximately 6' x by 21/2" and 
is of a jacket with the arms cut 
off.
2/24 MEDICAL ESCORT*
8:04 pm. A CMU student re­
ported that he had accidently 
stepped on a nail that was pro­
truding from a piece of wood in 
the basement of his fraternity 
house. The nail penetrated the 
heel of his right tennis shoe and 
went into his foot. The victim 
was transported to Presbyterian 
Hospital. He later phoned and 
requested transport back to 
Presbyterian Hospital due to an 
allergic reaction to his medica­
tion.
2/26 THEFT, 11:27 am. The 
store manager of the Carnegie 
Shoppe reported to the CMU 
campus police that a black male, 
about 5' 9" with short hair, wear­
ing a dark jacket and carrying 
different colored papers in his 
hand, had just walked out of the 
store safe room. The store man­
ager ran from the customer 
counter to the safe room to see if 
anything was missing. She found 
$621 in cash missing. A descrip­
tion was put out to all CMU 
police units.
An officer noticed a person fit­
ting the description walking 
down Forbes Avenue toward 
South Craig Street. The officer 
stopped the man and asked him 
to return with him to the Carn­
egie Shoppe in Skibo Hall. The 
suspect willingly returned, and 
the store manager made a posi­
tive identification. The actor was 
arrested and searched. A pile of 
bills was found hidden under 
the passenger seat of the police

car where the suspect had been 
sitting.
2/26 UNKNOWN ODOR,
9:33 pm. Campus Police was 
notified of a burning odor in 
Mellon Institute. A check of the 
area revealed an unknown odor. 
Several labs on the same and 
other floors were clear of the 
odor. The complainant stated 
that a Rent-A-Kill truck had 
been seen at the loading dock. It 
was unknown if spraying was 
done in the building.
2/27 THEFT, 11:54 am. Acom- 
plainant reported that someone 
entered a room in Mellon Insti­
tute and removed a black and 
silver portable laminating ma­
chine. The machine has a label 
that reads “GBC” and is the prop­
erty of the super computer de­
partment. The estimated value 
of the machine is $200.
2/27 VEHICLE ACCIDENT,
12:37 pm. A vehicle struck a 
pole in front of the chain in the 
small Skibo lot. The pole was 
bent over and the lock was dam­
aged. The traffic monitor in­
formed the officer that he was 
able to straighten up the pole. 
The driver had a tough time 
getting his white Chevy van, 
belonging to Dunkin’ Donuts,
around another vehicle. He hit 
the left side of the pole, denting 
the van and leaving marks of 
yellow paint. No other damage 
was reported.
2/27 FIRE ALARM, 2:27 pm. 
A fire alarm was activated for a 
fraternity house. Responding 
units checked the area and found 
that toast had been burned. The 
master alarm would not reset at 
the time. The system was put on 
hold until the smoke dissipated.
2/27 MISSING PERSON,
9:25 pm. While on patrol through 
Doherty Grad House, an officer 
was stopped by a woman who 
was looking for her niece, a CMU 
student. The student’s mother 
had been trying to contact her 
all day, and asked her aunt to 
check on her, as she was taking 
medication. The officer and the 
student’s aunt and uncle checked 
her room, but did not locate her. 
The student’s RA was contacted, 
and reported that she had spo­
ken with the student on Wednes­
day and everything seemed fine. 
A note was left on the student’s 
door to contact Campus Police. 
At 10:40 pm, the student was 
located and told to contact her 
mother.
2/28 THEFT, 5:34 am. A pa­
trolling officer noticed a bag 0f 
bagels on the table by the bank­
ing machines in Skibo. At the 
same time, an ABM employee 
reported seeing a strange man 
in the kitchen of the Tartan Grill. 
The officer investigated and 
found a CMU student asleep on 
the stairs leading to the second 
floor of Skibo. There were ap­
proximately 2 1/2 bagels lying 
under his leg. Another officer 
was called, and he recognized 
the student as the same person 
he had dealt with earlier in the 
evening, and who had been ex­
tremely intoxicated at the time. 
His keys were taken from him, 
and a cab was called to take him 
home, but the cab company re­
fused to transport him because 
of his intoxicated state. Some 
fraternity brothers stated that 
they would take care of him.
When the student was asked 
why he had been in the Tartan 
Grill kitchen, he stated that he 
was very hungry and was look­
ing for something to eat. He was 
then transported home by the 
officers. The student was very 
cooperative and offered to pay 
for the bagels. An internal cita­
tion will be issued through Stu­
dent Affairs for the theft of the 
bagels.

Room roster goes on-line
The Housing Office has prepared an on-line 
. roster of room reservations for viewing by any 
student. The roster is a 90-page dorm by dorm 
listing of all spaces in the system. The file will be 
accessible for the next two weeks and will be
¦ updated once a day, usually by 10 am, with the 
-previous night’s reservation activity during Room 
Draw. The file, ~hc00/f92-dorm.rpt, can be ac­
cessed from any Andrew account.
U.S. Senate candidate to 
come to campus
Lynn Yeakel, the progressive candidate for 
the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, will be on 
campus on Monday, March 9, from noon to 1:30 
pm to meet with students and answer questions. 
The event, which will be held in the Graduate 
Student Coffee House, is open to all. Statements 
on Yeakel’s stands on the issues and her history 
of public service will be available at this time.
Architecture Department 
receives honorable mention
Carnegie Mellon’s Architecture Department 
received an honorable mention for its course 
sequence Design for Building Performance: An
¦ Integrative Approach at the fifth annual Educa­
tion Honors jury of the American Institute of
Architects (AIA). The AIA’s Education Honors jury 
reviews current courses in architectural education 
across the country to select the most innovative 
programs. The CMU course sequence is offered 
through the Center for Building Performance and 
Diagnostics in the Department of Architecture and 
is taught by professors Volker Hartkopf, Vivian 
Loftness, Ardeshir Mahdavi, and Stephen Lee.
Legislation allows parents to 
borrow from retirement funds
Congressman Frank Guarini (D-N.J.) recently 
introduced a bill in Congress (H.R. 4302) that 
would alter Internal Revenue Code to allow em­
ployees to borrow money from their employer-pro­
vided retirement plans at low interest rates to pay 
for their children’s higher education costs. Cur­
rently, employees can only take loans for higher 
education without penalty after age sixty. Interest 
rates are very high and the loan can only be for five 
years.
The legislation introduced by Guarini would al­
low individuals to access their savings at any age to 
pay for higher education. The repayment period 
would be extended from five to fifteen years and 
interest rates would be set at not less than one half 
of the prime rate. Guarini believes that his legisla­
tion will encourage more savings towards retire­
ment if individuals know that they can access their 
savings for higher education costs.

; gan, engineering and public 
policy; and University Cohesive- 
: ness, co-chaired by Patrick 
; Ohlin, a student in Literary and 
cultural studies, and Barbara 
! Anderson, drama.
Five of the 10 existing Com­
mission task forces presented 
their mid-year reports to the 
entire Commission for discus­
sion and possible feedback. How­
ever, not all of the task forces 
; were able to present their re- 
1 ports due to an exam scheduled 
'in the same room during the 
! campus free time.
! The task force on Cultures and 
' Languages recommended a pi- 
; lot program of three six-unit 
; mini-courses for next fall that 
1 will serve to initiate and/or sup- 
' port cultural programs across 
! campus. One mini will be a basic 
! course for 40 students which will 
.introduce them to issues and 
techniques of cultural analysis. 
Students enrolled in this intro- 
ductory course will then choose 
; one of two additional courses 
; which will explore and contrast
minority cultures in the United 
States or elsewhere in the world.
The second two minis are in­
tended to be flexible in their 
content so that additional top­
ics, such as comparisons of aca­
demic and business cultures 
across the world, can be explored 
from semester to semester.
The task force for Attention to 
Teaching and the Teaching Cen­
ter is exploring ways to expand 
the effectiveness of the Teach­
ing Center. The task force also 
expressed some difficulties in 
obtaining student input toward 
the adequacy and effectiveness 
of their teaching experiences on 
campus. Student Government 
President Hyun Shin promised 
to consult with Susan Ambrose, 
director of University Teaching, 
to set up student groups to help 
assess the adequacy of the Fac­
ulty Course Evaluations, the 
quality of teaching, and other 
areas of interest-to the task force.
The Metacurriculum task 
force announced a new program 
in the residence halls in con­
junction with Housing, Interna­
tional Affairs, and the Modem 
Languages department, which 
will designate particular floors
for international students and 
U.S. students interested in in­
ternational affairs, as well as 
“language floors” for students 
studying foreign languages. The 
task force is exploring ways to 
implement such programs with­
out isolating the students that 
participate in them.
The Honor Code task force 
reported that there appears to 
be little student interest in an 
honor code. Recognizing that 
most existing honor codes were 
established before World War
II, the task force is still explor­
ing whether or not an honor code 
is necessary and feasible for the 
campus. A greater concern of 
the task force, however, is the 
apparent lack of basic academic 
ethics among students.
The task force on Advising is 
currently writing the criteria for 
an advising award to parallel 
other recognitions of excellence 
in teaching on campus like the 
Ryan Teaching Award and the 
Doherty Education Award.
A complete report of the task 
forces’ mid-year updates is avail­
able at the Skibo Information 
Desk and the Circulation Desk

LIS-II moves CMU toward ‘complete electronic library’
MERCURY, from page 1
tronic bulletin boards.
While the problems may be 
small, SCS faculty member 
Roy Maxion doesn’t see them 
that way. In reference to the 
bugs he saw in LIS-II, Maxion 
said, “If LIS-II were an ex­
perimental system ... I could 
be more tolerant of this sort of 
thing, but experimental isn’t 
the way LIS-II is being repre­
sented.” --------------------------
However,
Brian Harri­
son, a member 
of the Project 
Mercury 
team, is more 
pleased with 
LIS-II. “There 
will be a really 
hot improve­
ment with re­
gards to
startup speed _________________
in the near
future,” he said. “And with 
regard to speed and functi ons, 
have you ever tried LIS-I and 
LIS-II side-by-side?”
Another important issue 
regarding LIS-II revolves 
around privacy. LIS-II logs 
information about users 
which is used for the research 
aspects of Project Mercury.
According to Maxion, this par­
ticular feature of LIS-II demands 
further review.
“Should the University pro­
vide statements of assurance to 
the effect that they will not use 
the search data in certain ways?” 
said Maxion in a post to an elec­
tronic bulletin board. “And who 
should determine what those 
ways, if any, are? Should the 
LIS system itself make an ex-

tem ...I could be more tolerant of

sented. ”

SCS faculty member
plicit statement to the user to 
the effect that his/her search 
session is being monitored and 
recorded? Should the user have 
the option of saying no?”
“As is the case with any large 
work in progress you wish to 
improve, you have to get feed­
back and statistics,” said 
Harrison. “You can’t blindly ad­
just how things work... with­
out knowing how it’s used. 
I’ve been told that it was sat­
isfactory with the provost; 
however, as is the case with 
any security issues, they can 
be circumvented by the de­
termined.”
Complaints aside, it seems

Audience Participation:
APhiO: The chairman of the 
election board is Erik Richard­
son. The election board is not 
doing the elections as an APhiO 
service project anymore.
Committee Reports:
Academic Affairs (Mike 
Tomblyn): We had a meeting 
today at 6 pm. We have gotten 
further on the Faculty Course 
Evaluations and we have a meet­
ing with Bill Elliot tomorrow 
about the issue. We also found 
out that pass/fail grades have 
been discussed before within 
faculty Senate and we are try­
ing to see if we can get a hold of 
transcripts of those meetings.
Campus Affairs (Erik 
Altmann): The CMDS task force 
has started communication with 
CMDS. They met with Roger 
Heydt and Greg Smith last week 
and will meet with them again 
next week. Last week’s meeting 
was together with the SDC food 
committee. The current topic is 
improvement ofvegetarian food. 
Contact Amy Potthast for de­
tails.
Jim, Tony, and I met with 
Dean Murphy and Tim Foster 
this afternoon about bike racks. 
With luck we’ll have about 50 to 
100 new spots for bikes by the 
end of the month. Three loca­
tions will get new racks in this 
phase: Wean Hall, the gym, and
the garage. The garage location 
is experimental. There will be 
lockers by the garage racks so 
people could lock helmets and 
seats. We hope this location will 
attract commuters. Once it’s in 
place we’ll publicize it, and we’ll 
see if it catches on.
Jim and Tony are meeting 
later this week to finish up de­
signs for structures to cover 
racks. They are also working on 
a survey to see what people want 
and what they would use if it 
were there. There is a question 
to see if more people would com­
mute if they had better access to 
showers and lockers to store 
daytime clothes. The survey is 
joint work with the Bike Club 
and Student Affairs.
Matt Shevach, Josh Knauer, 
Seth Halvaksz, myself, and oth­
ers met with Barb Kviz last week 
to talk about coordinating recy­
cling at the fraternities. There is 
a lot of interest, but the houses 
are doing things independently, 
and there is no liaison with Barb 
Kviz. Matt is going to talk to 
people at IFC to try to set up a 
recycling coordinator. Talk to 
him for details.
Funding and Recognition 
(Michael Loomis & Amy 
Blake): We met with GSO last 
Thursday. They requested to 
have half of the activities fee for 
graduate students as opposed to 
3 5 percent. They want us to look 
in to the number of graduate 
students versus the number of 
undergraduate students in any 
activity. Also sending out a sur­
vey of participation towards par­
ticipation in carnival.
Public Relations (Erik 
Larson): The new calendar is

President needs to 
listen to students
As the president of this Uni­
versity, Robert Mehrabian 
: speaks at Freshman Orientation 
each year. Unfortunately, stu- 
; dents rarely see him after that. 
We know that he is active with 
alumni, but does he really care 
about the current students at 
Carnegie Mellon?
With programs like the Com­
mission on Undergraduate Edu­
cation, Mehrabian claims to be 
concerned with the educational 
endeavors of students.
But on a day-to-day basis and 
at a personal level, it appears 
that he is just not interested. 
How hard would it be for 
Mehrabian to read his email or a 
few bboards every now and then? 
Yet he has his email forwarded 
to his secretary.
Students have no idea what 
Mehrabian does every day in his 
office on the sixth floor of Warner 
Hall, and we’ve seen no attempt 
on his part to fill us in.
An outstanding example of why 
students see Mehrabian as inac­
cessible is his failure to hold regu­
larly scheduled officehours. Once 
a semester is not acceptable. This 
projects an image of inaccessibil­
ity, even though he claims that
If you plan on moving off cam­
pus and leasing an apartment, 
watch out! There are unscrupu­
lous landlords who will take ad­
vantage of students. Before you 
sign any lease, make sure you 
know what you are getting into.
• Start your search for an apart­
ment at the off-campus housing 
office. Although the people there 
don’t recommend particular 
landlords, they take apartments 
owned by landlords that have a 
reputation for problems with stu­
dents off their lists of available 
apartments.
• Once you find a place you 
want to lease, take steps to pro­
tect your rights. Read the lease 
very carefully, including the fine 
print, which may not seem very 
important at first glance. It could 
be very important, however, if 
problems arise between you and 
your landlord, because signifi­
cant stipulations often appear in 
fine print.
• If you don’t understand any 
part of the lease, don’t sign it. 
Find someone who can explain 
the language and implications of 
the lease. A good resource on 
campus is the Legal Affairs De­
partment, which has weekly of­
fice hours for students. Legal 
Affairs offers free legal advice 
for CMU-related problems and 
can explain the lease you are 
about to sign. Don’t feel embar­
rassed about not understanding 
a lease. It is better to ask ques­
tions now and avoid problems 
later.
• Do not sign a lease or any 
other document that contains a 
confession of judgement clause. 
When you sign a document with 
this clause, you give up your right 
to present your case in court be­
fore a judgement is entered 
against you.
This would mean that your 
landlord could have your bank
this is not the case.
Students don’t feel they can 
call the president’s office to 
schedule an appointment, as his 
secretary suggests. How do we 
know that we won’t be shuffled 
off to Murphy or some other ad­
ministrator?
If a problem is important 
enough for a student to appeal 
directly to Mehrabian, he should 
see that student. In addition, 
why not schedule an office hour 
once a week or even once every 
two weeks? It’s not too much to 
ask that the president give stu­
dents an opportunity to get to 
know him on their terms.
It isn’t too much for students to 
ask to see the president of their 
university every now and then. 
Here’s a suggestion for Meh­
rabian: attend an occasional stu­
dent event and actually talk to 
the students. Try programs like 
Gathering Storr or Candlelight 
Dinners, in addition to Carnival 
and the International Festival.
Listen to what students have 
to say and experience some of 
the reality of CMU, instead of 
the lofty view you have right 
now from that corner office in 
Warner Hall.
accounts frozen and take posses­
sion of your car and other prop­
erty for any number of reasons 
without your even being present 
at a court hearing. If your par­
ents signed any documents, they 
too may have action taken 
against them. There have been 
several cases of landlords using 
this tactic against students. If 
you sign such an agreement, you 
risk having a judgement made 
against you, your credit record 
damaged, your bank accounts 
frozen, and your car and prop­
erty repossessed.
• When you do sign the lease 
make sure there is a clause that 
states that at the time you take 
possession of the apartment you 
and the landlord will go through 
the apartment together taking 
notes of damages that already 
exist.
Make note of the condition of 
everything from kitchen appli­
ances to carpeting. Take pictures, 
and have the landlord sign and 
date both the written list and the 
photos. This will help to make 
sure that you will not be charged 
for damages that were done be­
fore you occupied the apartment. 
If you have any other stipula­
tions you waiit in the lease, make 
sure they are added and initialed 
by you and the landlord.
• If you do encounter problems 
with a landlord, remember that 
you have specific legal rights 
under the Pennsylvania Land­
lord and Tenant Act. If you be­
lieve you are being wronged by 
your landlord, consult the Legal 
Affairs Department to find out 
what recourse you have.
These precautions can make 
sure that you are not taken ad­
vantage of by a landlord. Make 
sure you understand your lease 
and ask questions. Taking pre­
cautions now may save you a lot 
of aggravation later.
Commission requires stu­
dent participation
Editor:
With half of this 
semester behind us, I 
would like to take this 
opportunity to tell you 
about a few things 
taking place on campus.
Let me go ahead and start out with 
the Commission on Undergraduate 
Education. There are copies of different 
task forces’ progress reports available 
throughout the campus at different lo­
cations, including the Skibo Informa­
tion Desk, Hunt Library, and the E&S 
Library. Some of you may not quite 
realize the importance of the Commis­
sion.
What the Commission is doing, in 
essence, is navigating the future of the 
University’s undergraduate education. 
The recommendations that task forces 
propose and the actions that the Uni­
versity takes will forever change the 
way Carnegie Mellon educates its un­
dergraduates. Because oftheimmense 
impact that the Commission’s endeav­
ors can have, it is critical that we, the 
students, understand what is going on 
to ensure that our concerns and sugges­
tions are well represented.
I know all of us have a lot of other 
things to do, but please take a moment, 
pick up a copy, and read over the re­
ports. You will actually find them in­
teresting and quite informative.
Secondly, you may be interested to 
know that Student Government has 
newly created an Environmental Task 
Force. It will investigate various ways 
to increase environmental awareness 
and work to improve recycling and 
waste reduction. Josh Knauer will be 
chairing this initiative. If you are inter­
ested in getting involved with the task 
force, please contact Josh.
The following are Student Govern­
ment representatives overseeing other 
Student Government initiatives. Please 
direct any specific questions about each 
program to these individuals:
Student Mentor Program — Natalie 
Gesmond
Academic Planning Fair — Michael 
Ewedosh and Missy Van Royen
Gathering Storr (in conjuction with 
Student Affairs)—Rhonda Struminger
As always, if you have any questions 
or concerns, please do not hesitate to 
contact me at x5391 or on campus — 
mail your comments to Student Gov­
ernment President’s Box, Skibo. Take 
care.
P.S. Only two weeks until Spring 
Break!

Referendum results dis­
cussed by professor
Editor:
As a statistics 
teacher, it would be 
unconscionable to 
overlook an opportu­
nity to explain diffi­
culties involved in the recent referen­
dum. Additional impetus stems from 
some rude remarks on bulletin boards 
which indicate some people have mis­
understood my previous comments.
As The Tartan indicated [“Referen­
dum inconclusive: Senate upholds reso­
lution,” 2/24], I was approached by stu­
dent senators on both sides of the issue. 
Each party sought advice on drawing 
conclusions from the referendum. I 
apprised each that I had been ap­
proached by the other, and told each 
group the same things.
I was surprised that the central ques­
tion was whether more than 50% of the 
students wanted to rescind the resolu­
tion. It is not obvious that this is the 
appropriate question to ask — such 
considerations have played a negligible 
role in U.S. democracy. However, stipu­
lating the question, a practical solution 
is to perform a classical hypothesis test:
1. Randomly poll n students. Esti­
mate p, the proportion who favor re­
scission, byp = X/n for X the number of 
rescinders.
2. The null and alternative hypoth­
eses are
H0: p < .5 versus HA: p > .5.
We want to decide whether the data 
strongly suggest that more than 50 
percent of the campus favor rescission.
3. Select a, the probability of incor­
rectly deciding p > .5. The magnitude of 
a decreases as the need for certitude of 
correct rejection increases.
4. Calculate the test statistic
ts = 2n1/2(p - .5).
5. Compare the test statistic to a 
critical value. Reject the null hypoth­
esis if ts is larger than the 1 - ath 
percentile point from a standard nor­
mal distribution.
If one’s mother’s life depended on 
accuracy, one could avoid a hidden ap­
proximation by using the incomplete 
beta function to calculate the least a for 
which the data rejects the null.
However, as I told all inquirers, the 
above procedure is entirely inapplicable 
when the sample is not random. The 
referendum entailed massive response 
bias — those who cared were sure to 
vote, but the indifferent did not.
There is no statistical conclusion to 
be drawn from the numbers available. 
This is not the same as asserting that 
the results are statistically insignifi­
cant, an error into which some have 
fallen.

Studying abroad offers op­
portunities of a lifetime
Editor:
I am writing to you 
from CMU’s study 
abroad program in 
France, where I am 
one of eight students 
studying this semester at the CMU 
Centre de Tours. I know that the pro­
gram has been publicized in The Tar­
tan and elsewhere (we read The Tartan 
here in Tours), and I would like to add 
a few words of my own as one student 
who is there as you read this letter.
I could tell you that study abroad is a 
life-changing experience, but that 
sounds too much like what my teachers 
and professors told me, and frankly, 
that’s not why I came to Tours. I am 
here for two reasons: the opportunity 
was too good to pass up, and ever since 
I had studied French in high school I 
had wanted a chance to actually use it
and check out the people who spoke it. 
Ifit changes my life, so much the better; 
my life wasn’t anything incredible to 
begin with anyway.
I heard about the program and real­
ized that a chance this good wouldnever 
come again. After all, I get a family and 
a semester in a French university, all 
for the same -price as I pay to live and 
study on campus in scenic Pittsburgh. 
My parents were willing, so I went to 
some banks and found out how to go 
into debt to pay for some travelling, and 
went to a bookstore and got a book to 
brush up on my rusty French.
I got on the plane poor as any stu­
dent, and I realized that when the cabin 
attendants talked in French, I couldn’t 
tell the words apart. I studied that 
French book halfway across the Atlan­
tic Ocean, and when I landed in Paris I 
was scared, excited, and tired.
As far as speaking the language, I am 
now practically bilingual. I can con­
verse with any French-speaking per­
son on just about any subject, and by 
havingthe second language I have been 
able to speak to people from Algeria, 
Africa, Vietnam, Japan, and Germany, 
as well as with French people.
I have made plenty offriends in Tours, 
friends I will not want to part with at 
the end of this second semester. I have, 
for the first time in my life, made friends 
who don’t look at me and see a WASP 
Non-Gay Male. In the U. S., everyone is 
conditioned, no matter how hard they 
struggle, to look at you and see your 
race and sex before all else. The fact 
that I am American is interesting to my 
friends in Tours, but it is not impor­
tant; it only adds to my personal riches.
The reason I wrote this letter is to 
give you a good image of studying 
abroad. Some people will gripe all their 
lives, but I am having a great time here. 
Please, don’t believe everything you 
hear about your favorite foreign coun­
try, be it France, Senegal, Japan, or 
Brazil.
Don’t assume that you can’t do it; 
chances are that you just don’t have the 
information which makes it possible. 
Go now, while you are still a student, 
before you only have two weeks vaca­
tion a year. The International Educa­
tion Office is in your C-Book. And if you 
are thinking about going to France, 
definitely go and find out about the 
CMU Centre de Tours, because with­
out you, the program won’t be worth it 
(and besides, they need people).
No foreign experience can be more 
than what you make it. If you don’t go 
for it, you can kiss the opportunities 
goodbye.

Although I’m not a fan of mili­
tary operations, I would hate to 
see ROTC banned from campus. 
I’m quite sure that the program 
attracts good students who 
might choose to go elsewhere if a 
ROTC scholarship didn’t help 
them with the costs of this uni­
versity.
I suspect, too, that the aver­
age ROTC person has a perspec­
tive very different from my own, 
and I want to have the benefit of 
another perspective.
Unfortunately, that perspec­
tive comes at a price that Carn­
egie Mellon cannot pay. A school 
with a reputation for attracting 
bright people cannot afford to 
look dumb by being inconsis­
tent. The University permits 
gays and lesbians to enroll, but 
ROTC programs do not. If the 
University does not allow any 
discrimination by sexual orien­
tation in its admission policies, 
it cannot have ROTC.
This is a very unfortunate 
problem. The only solutionis for 
the Armed Forces to change their 
policy about allowing gays and 
lesbians in the military. Throw­
ing ROTC off our campus, of 
course, is something that we 
don’t want to do; nevertheless, 
we don’t have any choice.
We seem to have a clear-cut 
problem. So why has there been
so much discussion? Why is this 
such a divisive issue? My feeling

ertheless, they seem to feel that
The only solution is for the Armed

is that those of us who feel 
strongly that discrimination 
must end haven’t been very sen­
sitive to the plight of ROTC folks. 
These people don’t set the poli-
their personal characters are be­
ing attacked. This is the mes­
sage I think our fellow students 
in ROTC programs have per­
ceived:
Dear right-wing nutcases,
We know that you intransi­
gent neanderthals — oh, sorry, 
you’re too boneheaded for those 
words — you ignorant yahoos 
hate gays and lesbians. Well, 
that’s too bad, because we don’t 
like you and your program. We’ll 
show you a thing or two by throw- 
ingyour asses off campus. That’ll 
teach you to mess with us clear- 
thinking types. So there.
Vengefully,
The anti-discrimination group
I’m not quite sure how (or if) 
we’ve sent that message. The 
Senate resolution was worded 
fairly strongly and punitively, 
but it didn’t present the sort of

Present-day heroes 
face skeptical media
t\—
John Funge
With all of the problems that face us 
today, we need more than just help; we 
need heroes. Yet, where are today’s he­
roes? Where are those pacifying figures 
that represent an unconditional solution 
to the most menacing difficulties, the 
people we look up to, and aspire to be 
like? Where are they? They’re extinct. In 
many ways our society has restructured 
itself so as to make the concept of the 
hero obsolete. One of the specific influ­
ences that has largely contributed to the 
retirement of our heroes is our gloating 
mass media.
Mass media has become an incredible 
force in terms of swaying public opinion. 
No longer is anything deemed private. In 
attempts to offer what is to be inter­
preted as thorough news, coverage, mass 
media can often cross the line of good 
taste. As the media exposes everything, 
they not only show us our heroes “with 
their pants down,” but also give us com­
mentary on how well they pulled them 
down.
Examples of media execution of heroes 
are not hard to find. Perhaps the most 
glaring example of this is what hap­
pened to veterans due to media coverage 
of the Vietnam War. Also, the vast cover­
age of the Rodney King incident sure 
must have tarnished the heroic image of 
police in general.
Look at the very heroic George Wash­
ington. Of course, he lived in a time in 
which people could not turn on their 
televisions and witness him passing out
and vomiting. Pm sure our heroic opin­
ions of George Washington would change, 
if we were aware of his every move and 
exactly how he treated his slaves.
Another example of media massacre 
can be seen in the Father Bruce Ritter 
case that happened a couple of years ago. 
Here is a man who to many may have 
been seen as a hero for having founded 
the international charity organization 
Covenant House.
However, Ritter and much of the good 
he did were irreversibly ruined by in­
tense coverage of a far from cut and dried 
case involving sexual abuse and misap­
propriation of funds.
Well, one might argue that in a situa­
tion such as the Bruce Ritter case, he 
wasn’t truly a hero as was shown by the 
media. As a result, the media helped 
bring about justice. However, should 
bringing about justice be the roll of the 
media? Truly, it’s hard to say. Perhaps, in 
some cases, it would be better if the public 
were a little less informed.
Ironically just the opposite usually hap­
pens. Cases of indiscretion seem to at­
tract more news coverage than normal.
Not only does the media put extra at­
tention into stories that seem scandal­
ous, but it seems that the media goes out 
of its way in order to damage reputations. 
Let’s face it, heroes don’t sell.
People would much rather hear about 
the mishaps of those they look up to. 
Perhaps it is that we can rest our con­
sciences by witnessing the impropriety of 
the “great.”
Another facet involved with the extinc­
tion of heroes is the fact that contempo­
rary media-influenced ethics seem much 
less clearly defined than in past eras. It is

Financial aid system 
overhaul necessary
—
\ R. D. Quinn
Tuition and financial aid are two of 
the worst things that face college stu­
dents and their parents. Tuition is 
always going up and your financial aid 
never seems to be what you think you 
should be getting. The tuition and fi­
nancial aid philosophy of schools 
around the country must change, or 
both future students and the institu­
tions themselves will suffer.
The financial aid system in this coun­
try, in general, is one that is unfair and 
inadequate. If you get financial aid, 
you feel like you haven’t gotten enough, 
and if you don’t get any, you feel that 
you are on the short end of the stick. 
People who don’t get any financial aid 
should feel cheated because around 20 
percent of our tuition at CMU goes 
towards financial aid, which means 
that if you pay full tuition, you are not 
only supporting your education but 
other people’s, too.
This type of system is nothing short ' 
of wealth redistribution. If your par­
ents have saved any amount of money 
over the years before you starting at­
tending school, or have achieved a high 
income, they are expected to give up a 
large chunk of that money. Meanwhile, 
families that had the extra income to 
save and didn’t because of their spend­
ing choices also get your money. This 
is not to say there are not students who 
genuinely are in need of financial aid
and whose families have absolutely no 
opportunity to save or get ahead, but 
there are some people who will make 
financial choices to support a very high 
standard of living, instead of saving for 
the future.
In addition to being able to keep tu­
ition high because wealthier families 
have students attending universities, 
tuition is kept high by the government 
loan and grant programs. Private insti­
tutions can keep tuitions high, because 
they know they have a large source of 
financial aid through the government.
To top off all of this is the fact that 
middle- and upper-middle-income fami­
lies pay a large amount in taxes that 
support government programs and state 
schools. So, the small amount of finan­
cial aid that some students get is the 
money their parents already gave to the 
government. State schools have the 
same tuition for every student. If your 
family has an income of $200,000, you 
still pay the few thousand dollars for 
tuition, which is supported by middle- 
and upper-middle-class people.
The system that establishes need is 
also highly flawed. The basic data about 
every family is analyzed and out comes 
a number, that most likely has no rela­
tionship to the true financial picture of 
each family.
If parents have any kind of compli­
cated financial situation, the system 
has very limited means to deal with it.
The amount of financial aid awarded 
does not take into account the ability of 
a family to borrow money. At some 
point, banks will no longer lend you 
money, even if you might be able to

Student unfairly accused of making terroristic threats
Christian M.Restifo
When you hear the word “ter­
rorist,” what do you think? Does 
the image of some masked war­
rior for the Hezbollah holding 
an automatic weapon from the 
door of a hijacked plane come to 
mind? Or how about the scene of 
a member of the IRA planting a 
bomb in a busy train station in 
London? How about an architec­
ture student here at CMU who
writes a letter to President 
Mehrabian and encloses a shred­
ded copy of Carnegie Mellon 
Magazine?
I jokingly thought of starting 
this column using these images 
to play a game of “Which of these 
things is not like the other?” The 
truth is, it would be funny, in a 
sarcastic way, if the third situa­
tion were made up. The sober­
ing fact is that a student did 
such a thing, and she was 
charged with a terrorist act.
From what she tells me, she 
sent a hand-written letter to 
President Mehrabian, complain-
First, I used to be under the 
impression that the Counseling 
Center provided strict confidentiality

ing about the state of affairs on 
this campus. She said that if 
things didn’t change, students 
would start killing themselves 
and the people in the adminis­
tration. To show her anger, she 
included a shredded copy of Car­
negie Mellon Magazine. When I 
talked to her about this, she said
that she made no attempt to 
hide her identity, though she 
hadn’t signed her name. Accord­
ing to her, she had left enough 
clues as to who she is.
Well, I don’t know if Meh­
rabian ever actually received the 
letter. It was eventually handed 
to Security, and this student was
charged with some type of “ter­
roristic threat.” Even now, after 
all the meetings and discussions, 
she still does not know exactly 
what she did wrong. In fact, at 
the time of this writing, she has 
yet to see a letter formally charg­
ing her with breaking a rule.
I watched what happened to 
this poor woman, and I feel ex­
tremely sorry for her. She faces 
possible probation, suspension, 
or even expulsion. There was 
talk that she might have to un­
dergo counseling. To add insult 
to injury, she was told that if

these things.
The real causes are basically the tre­
mendous decline in purchasing power of 
the American worker and these Republi­
can policies of unregulated capitalism.
The decline in purchasing power of the 
American worker has resulted from the 
breaking of unions, pay cuts, transfer­
ence of American manufacturing jobs to 
third world countries, opposition to in­
creases in the minimum wage, transfer- 
ringtaxes from the wealthy to the middle 
class and poor, and the high cost of medi­
cal care and lack of insurance for many 
Workers.
This decline in purchasing power has 
translated into a lack of demand for 
expensive consumer items like houses 
and cars.
Now we have the sad and embarrass­
ing spectacle of our President traveling to 
foreign countries to find consumers with 
adequate purchasing power for our prod­
ucts when it is Republican policies that 
are largely responsible for the lack of 
demand in this country.
Finally, the Republicans tried unregu­
lated capitalism in the 1920s just as they 
have done in the 1980s.
The result in the 1920s was the Great 
Depression and presently the current re­
cession and the failure of the savings and 
loans.
Unregulated capitalism is as big a fail­
ure as centralized Stalinist type social­
ism.

A PERSON’S
Often times, students won­
der who they can speak to 
about campus issues. Stu­
dents regularly get referred to 
officials underneath Presi­
dent Mehrabian. However, the 
President is ultimately re­
sponsible for all the activities 
pertaining to Carnegie Mel­
lon. What do you think 
about improving accessi­
bility to President Mehra­
bian by scheduling weekly 
office hours?

Similarities unite all peoples
David Hunt
Nigger. Spic. Fag. Kike. Wop. Towel- 
head. Gook. Nerd. What do all of these 
y/ords have in common? The first an­
swer is obvious — hatred. These are 
words used to disparage people who we 
feel are in some way inferior, almost 
always because they are somehow dif­
ferent.
¦ To understand why people feel the 
need to use words like these, we need to 
Recognize a fundamental tendency of 
the human species — that of classifica­
tion. We love to organize things, and at 
the most basic level we organize people 
into two groups: US and THEM. This 
brings me to the other word that comes 
to my mind when I hear these terms 
used—that word is pride. We love to be 
proud of what we are, usually by com­
paring ourselves to others because they 
^re not us. THEY are lazy; THEY are 
ruining the country; THEY are cor­
rupting our children — as opposed to 
US, who are hard-working, patriotic, 
and moral. WE are proud to be <insert 
your group hero so WE claim some 
high ground over THEM.
; But behind that pride is fear — fear 
that WE may actually be just like 
'¡THEM. The thought that there may be 
similarities frightens us—and we gen­
erally hate what we fear.
To protect ourselves we erect artifi­
cial walls — Gay Pride, Black Pride, 
White Power, etc. We love to draw at­
tention to our differences — and it is 
this attention to what makes us differ­
ent rather than what makes Us similar 
that causes so much hatred in our soci­
ety. I'll confide in you: I used to be very 
prejudiced against blacks. Every time I 
saw a black, I’d think “nigger.” I be­
lieved every bad stereotype—until my 
first year at U. Mass, when two of my 
neighbors were black. The first semes­
ter, all I did was notice differences — 
they were loud, obnoxious, and had no 
consideration for anyone but the black 
fraternity pledges in the room yelling 
over the ear-shattering music. It was 
all I could do to keep from being violent.
On the first day of the second semes­
ter, I went over and told them some­
thing. I told them that I was an engi­
neering student, that I found it very 
difficult to study anywhere but in my 
room, and that their decibel output was 
interfering with my concentration. 
“Wow! An engineering student! We 
didn’t know... no problem!” That entire 
semester I had to ask them to quiet 
down once, and it stayed quiet. Instead 
of them only perceiving a white pain- 
in-the-ass, they saw a fellow student 
with a particular phobia about study­
ing outside his room. And I began to see 
two people who would respond to rea­
son, just like me! It was the recognition 
of our similarity which enabled me to 
start razing the walls of prejudice in my 
brain. That was the beginning of a long
and emotionally painful journey which 
has resulted in my eliminating more 
than 99 percent of my prejudices.
This is not to say that all differences 
should be ignored. If we had no differ­
ences the world would be a very dull 
place, but, all in all, the differences 
between ourselves and all others are 
far outweighed by our similarities. We 
should be judged on the basis of our 
individual differences, not any group- 
characteristic.
So the next time you feel like wearing 
a t-shirt or button that proclaims your 
differences from those around you, re­
member that you could be rubbing 
someone’s nose in their own insecuri­
ties. They might make an US versus 
THEM classification, and start to fear 
and hate you. It is one thing to wear a 
piece of clothing representing your na­
tional origins — quite another to bla­
tantly advertise “I am proud to be what­
ever!”
Instead, just know that you are dif­
ferent from others, and yet are similar 
to all. Don’t be black, or white, or 
straight, or gay, whatever. Simply be.
We are all humans, living on this 
planet, and all are a collective US. Let’s 
start by recognizing this — let’s work 
towards breaking down all these barri­
ers of difference and hatred that we’ve 
erected, and let’s star* by asking our­
selves, “How am I similar to this person 
who I think is so different?”

acter that our ROTC folks seem to 
have construed.
The responses to the resolution 
seemed very defensive. Many people 
were quick to point out ROTC’s value 
and its importance to our campus.
The resolution, though, has noth­
ing to do with the character of ROTC 
members or the value of the ROTC 
program. It is merely a statement on 
improper administrative policy.
I wish that this could have been 
made more clear to our ROTC stu­
dents and their supporters. The mes­
sage I would like them to have per­
ceived would be this:
Dear ROTC student,
We view the ROTC program as an 
integral part of the campus commu­
nity. Unfortunately, the ROTC policy 
against admitting gays and lesbians 
violates our University policies on fair­
ness and openness in admissions. To 
comply with our own policies, we may 
have to terminate our ROTC program. 
This won’t affect you, but it will affect 
the future of ROTC at Carnegie Mel­
lon. We hope that you will support us 
as we petition the Armed Forces to 
change its admission polities. We want 
ROTC to stay on campus, but we can­
not compromise our commitment to
fairness and equal treatment, and we 
hope that you, too, are as committed 
to these values as we are.
Regretfully,
The anti-discrimination group
We need unity in order to send a 
strongmessage to outsiders. The sup­
port of the ROTC members can give 
us this unity.
If oui' school’s administration does 
send some kind of message to Wash­
ington, I hope that the message is 
broadly supported by the student body. 
Any such communication should 
stress that we don’t want to lose our 
ROTC programs, but such a loss is 
inevitable unless policy changes are 
made.
Rather than attack such policies, 
we should stress our commitment to 
eliminating discrimination. Policy­
makers are more likely to adjust the 
rules, if they see the change as inevi­
table and non-threatening. If we at­
tack the policymakers, they’re more 
likely to dig in their heels.
A confrontational approach resulted 
in a 50-50 vote here on campus. I’m 
not hopeful that confrontation will 
help us in Washington.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 9 March 199211Universities lack equitable financial aid
UNIVERSITIES, from page 9
make the payments. I realize the enormous amount 
of work that financial aid offices have and that 
they can’t give individual attention to each family’s 
situation, but this is even more reason for a 
financial aid overhaul.
A new system needs to be created that is fair to 
everyone, encourages savings, and allows stu­
dents to be able to take a bigger role in paying for 
their own education.
The first part of my proposal for financial aid 
would be to abolish the system of tuition money 
supporting financial aid. Tuition levels then could 
be lowered across the board. Why should the 
universities be in the business of redistributing 
the wealth of one group to another?
Instead of giving grants to students as part of 
financial aid packages, as is currently done, the 
school should give some of that money as loans at 
low interest rates. Larger amounts of aid could 
then be given and the school would get the money 
back at some point in the future. A system like 
this would require students to have a decent QPA. 
Loans would be small when the student first 
enters school and would grow with each succes­
sive year in order to protect the base funding of the 
system.
State and federal governments should also de­
velop loan systems that students can borrow from, 
regardless of financial need. This would give fami­
lies that don’t have a large need a resource from 
which to borrow money. Also, students whose 
parents are not willing to provide financial sup­
port for education would be able to borrow money 
themselves.
The other half of the problem is tuition. Here at 
CMU, once again our tuition has been raised, but 
at least it is reasonable compared to the rate of 
inflation; however, over the last several years 
tuition has more than out-paced inflation. As 
tuition rises faster than income, more and more 
people will turn to state schools, both those who 
truly can’t afford to go to over-priced private
much of the tuition will go toward financial aid, 
undergraduate programs will be improved with 
the money, and Carnegie Mellon is “aid-blind” in 
admissions.
As I stated previously, it is a little less than fair 
to expect wealthier families to support the educa­
tion of other students by using tuition money for 
financial aid. The school stated when tuition in-
As tuition rises faster than income, more and more 
people will turn to state schools, both those who truly 
can’t afford to go to over-priced private institutions and

institutions and those who aren’t willing to pay 
the high-priced tuition.
People are beginning to realize that a quality 
education can be obtained for a lot less money. 
Some studies even suggest that there is abso­
lutely no difference between a state school and a 
private school. Families will no longer be willing 
to invest the kind of money that schools like CMU 
are asking.
Tuition needs to be kept at some reasonable 
level, rising in relation to inflation and personal 
incomes. Every time tuition is raised here at 
CMU, the same three statements are issued:Freedom of speech 
threatened by officials
FREEDOM, from page 9
such a thing occurred, she would 
have to sign a waiver that would 
allow the dean of students ac­
cess to those files on counseling.
The fact that such a thought 
even exists makes me sick. First, 
I used to be under the impres­
sion that the Counseling Center 
provided strict confidentiality to 
anyone who went there.
I hope that this is true, and 
that people in the administra­
tion aren’t into muscling stu­
dents into signing waivers. Sec­
ond, I thought people in the ad­
ministration were a little more 
human.
This student handled the situ­
ation rather well, all things con­
sidered. She contacted an ACLU 
lawyer in preparation for pos­
sible legal action, and her de­
partment called another lawyer 
to clarify the matter.
According to the second law­
yer, this woman did nothing 
wrong. Although she was ready 
to go to court on this one, I’m 
glad she was spared the trouble.
Of course, the way in which 
she was spared really irks me. 
She was put on disciplinary pro­
bation for a year.
When told this, she asked that 
when she received written noti­
fication, the letter would include 
what specific university viola­
tion she was being charged with. 
Apparently, she was kept in the 
dark about this one.
At one point, there was the 
possibility of a University Com­
mittee on Discipline meeting be­
ing held.
In such a case, two faculty 
members and two students 
would have reviewed the case 
and decided upon it. That 
wouldn’t mean squat, however, 
if the dean of students decided 
to override the decision, some­
thing the position allows. So
much for due process.
What would make this situa­
tion comical if it didn’t cause 
stress to this person would be 
the mere conjecture that what 
she did was something akin to a 
terroristic threat. The letter was 
handwritten, with clues as to 
who she was, along with a torn 
magazine. It was not some death 
threat made from newspaper 
clippings.
She didn’t enclose a dead rat 
in the letter or mail an analog 
alarm clock in a brown package. 
She simply made a statement. 
While her method may have been 
less than admirable or produc­
tive, calling the act threatening 
is like saying, “I wish Dave were 
dead,” is the same as attempt­
ing murder.

Some people in the adminis­
tration are reading this column 
right now, and I know they are 
steamed.
Therefore, let us lay out some 
common groundwork for the fa­
vor I am about to ask.
I wrote the previous material 
after talking to this woman 
about what happened. We are 
both confused as to a great many 
things that possibly went on, 
and we wish for some facts to be 
produced.

creases were announced last spring, that there 
are enough students who pay full tuition to com­
pensate for the increase. Parents who pay full 
tuition or a large percentage of tuition should be 
mad as hell over statements such as those. And, as 
far as improved undergraduate programs, I am 
sure that we all question what improvements 
have been made.
The last statement about CMU being "aid-blind,” 
or any university that makes that claim, is hardly 
telling the whole truth. Ifit states that it can raise 
tuition, because there are enough full-paying fami­
lies, then it must make sure that it doesn’t have
too many families with high financial need oi; 
there will not be enough resources to support! 
these students.
Maybe universities admit more non-financial" 
need students when it looks like money will bes 
tight, but the difference between that and not> 
admitting financial aid dependent students is- 
just semantics. If institutions haven’t limited3 
people entering with financial need, then surely 
as tuition rises and non-need students turn to’ 
state schools, that situation will change. CMU‘ 
also justifies raising tuition by saying financial 
aid meets assessed financial need. If the sam£ 
institution assesses the need and guarantees the! 
aid, there is obviously a slight conflict of interest!
Financial aid and tuition policies need to be£ 
changed and soon. A fair financial aid system will; 
make it possible for schools like CMU to have* 
students from all financial strata, both now anc| 
in the future.
It is in universities’ and colleges’ own bes£ 
interest to change, or face a decline in student; 
population, because people have turned to statei, 
schools.»a

12The Tartan » Carnegie Mellon » 9 March 1992Students’ diets lack nutritious food
itykfSrMjh-
* Abbv SchiAbby Schiff
Ah, to enjoy that rare, leisurely break­
fast at Tartan Grill: you’ve got your 
orange juice, bagel, with cream cheese, 
sizzlin’ slab of bacon, USA Today, and 
a creamy-custard donut. Now if you 
could only find a quiet table at which to 
sit down, stuff your face, read about the 
latest chapter in the riveting Tammy 
Wynette.-Hillary Clinton tiff, and relax 
momentarily, your day would seem a 
bit more manageable ... right? Not so 
fast, kid — some of the items on your 
tray have {gasp!) very little nutritional 
value.
While this fascinating little tidbit may 
not be much of a news flash to those 
diners who are so thoroughly disgusted 
with the Tartan Grill’s greasy offerings 
tfyat they have taken to munching on 
pages from the “Life” and “Money” sec­
tions of their newspapers during meal­
time, many happily oblivious Carnegie 
Mellon students have no idea what 
they’re eating when they consume the 
food with which Dining Service pro­
vides them. Nor do many of them want 
to, probably due to weak stomachs or 
an aversion to household pests.
But matters like that are of little 
consequence when a national event of 
great magnitude and importance is 
sweeping through the union.
For the benefit of anyone lucky enough 
not to have eaten in one of CMU’s 
dining facilities recently, March is Na­
tional Nutrition Month.
Someone at CMDS thought that this
event was newsworthy enough to tack 
up proclamation posters at the en­
trances to Salads Plus and Tartan Grill, 
implicitly alerting the weary masses 
who pass by en route to their respective 
eateries to get in on the fun!
Sadly, however, it is now several days 
into the month of March and I have 
observed few changes in my and my 
fellow students’ eating habits both in­
side and outside of CMDS facilities. 
Could it be that these zany, colorful, 
and strategically placed placards are 
simply pleading to stomachs numbed 
by years ofFrito andTwinkie consump­
tion?
I propose the opposite: that there are 
possible alternative explanations as to 
why most CMU students refuse to heed 
the pleas of this compelling nationwide 
campaign.
One possible explanation is that in 
matters concerning nutrition, Carnegie 
Mellon University students naturally 
distrust the institution that brought 
them french fries capable of destroying 
their gastro-intestinal systems.
Exactly why is Carnegie Mellon Din­
ing Service — famous for ruining what 
would otherwise be nutritious foods 
such as pasta and rice by drenching 
them in fatty oil (it keeps the stuff from 
sticking together) — calling attention 
to itself by advertising National Nutri­
tion Month?
Strange, indeed, that Tartan Grill, 
possibly second only to McDonald’s in 
the number of arteries clogged, is align­
ing itself with anything even remotely 
associated with improving healthy eat­
ing habits.
I’ll concede that Carnegie Mellon Din­
ing Service has improved and that new 
items like the Lean Burger are a step in
the right direction. I should mention 
that the aforementioned “lean” burger 
patty flunked my decidedly scientific 
“grease-o-rama test” rather spectacu­
larly.
Pressed gently between two paper
without missing a beat.
Carnegie Mellon University students 
who feast on chocolate frosted donuts 
are expected, similarly, to switch to 
more healthy fare without being al­
lowed so much as a couple of calorie-
Despite all these obstacles to National 
Nutrition Month’s success, I stubbornly 
believe that it can spur the switch to a 
healthier lifestyle, if we follow a few basic 
guidelines. Forget calories, fat grams, and 
all that vitamin mumbo-jumbo; just don’t eat 
anything that’s been dropped on the floor or 
into the garbage can.
napkins, it proceeded to deposit circu­
lar grease stains onto each one. This 
doesn’t mean that the burger isn’t leaner 
than Tartan’s normal one, but it might 
help explain why so many students are 
taking Carnegie Mellon Dining Ser­
vice’ sudden enthusiasm for nutritional 
vigilance with a grain of salt.
Another first question we must ask 
concerning the nutrition drive is: why 
now?
It’s somewhat odd that March was 
chosen as the period during which folks 
who normally sit around watching the 
Home Shopping Network twenty-four 
hours a day are supposed to put down 
the bag of fudge- 
covered Oreos and 
eagerly snatch up a 
few dozen tasty cel­
ery sticks instead
packed peanut butter cookies.
Perhaps, then, the reason why the 
student response to National Nutrition 
Month has been somewhat anemic is 
that the timing was way off.
Even if this dramatic behavior change 
were possible at any other time of the 
year, it is presently impossible: the 
months of March and April are a par­
ticularly volatile time in the lives of 
junk food addicts due to the influx of 
cheap Easter candy that typically fills 
the shelves of every drugstore this side 
of the Atlantic.
I’m not referring here to the cheap, 
hollow, wax-like and oily “choco-licious”
bunnies that sell at two for a dollar 
(these tasted great when we were kids, 
but then again, so did blue-flavored 
Kool-Aid).
My passions, and the main reason 
why National Nutrition Month’s ben­
efits are largely lost on me, are 
Cadbury’s sinful line of Easter Creme 
Eggs and Mini-Eggs.
After all, what good will a nutrition­
ally sound dinner at Tartan Grill do me 
if I rush over to Entropy afterwards for 
a luscious chocolate egg, complete with 
a gooey “yolk” that resembles sugary 
Elmer’s Glue? None whatsoever, I as­
sure you.
Despite all these obstacles to Na­
tional Nutrition Month’s success, I stub­
bornly believe that it can spur the switch 
to a healthier lifestyle, if we follow a 
few basic guidelines. Forget calories, 
fat grams, and all that vitamin mumbo- 
jumbo; just don’t eat anything that’s 
been dropped on the floor or into the 
garbage can.
Aside from that hard-and-fast rule, 
it’s advisable to reduce fat intake in 
order to insure that one doesn’t end up 
having to butter one’s self in order to 
get through the door of Skibo.
I suggest frozen yogurt instead of ice 
cream, with a pack or two of Mini-Eggs 
sprinkled on top. You never knew eat­
ing right could be so delicious.

WOULD-BE, from page 9
not possible for someone or some­
thing to please everyone, and 
one can be certain that everyone 
vfrill be exposed to it by our me­
dia. Words like “truth, justice, 
and the American way” seem 
ignorant in.light of today’s array 
of causes that a hero should fight 
for.
Since people are often not sure 
of what is right or wrong, they 
have a hard time identifying 
whom to look up to.
Well, so what that there is no 
such thing as a universal hero. 
It seems pretty obvious that one’s
hero is a very subjective thing. 
However, even individual he­
roes, such as parents or friends, 
have a harder time surviving 
today. The many unbelievable 
events that have been brought 
to us through the media have 
jaded us. As a result, most would 
consider the very concept of 
“hero” somewhat cheesy as they 
can easily pick out the negatives 
in everyone and everything.
The mass media possesses the 
rights of freedom of speech, ex­
pression, and press. However, 
with those rights comes a huge 
responsibility, because the me-
dia has an unrivaled ability to 
influence public opinion and 
morale. Yet, for whatever rea­
son, the media gravitates toward 
the negative. As a result, our 
heroes are gone, for the media 
will not make any concessions 
for unheroic, human behavior. I 
guess we’ll just have to get by on 
a juicy news story rather than 
have the help of heroes.

Men’s lacrosse charges into season
PRESS PASS
by Jason McDonald
My kingdom 
for a fast 
outfielder
Pittsburgh has a very funny 
way of showing it, but spring 
is here in full force. It wasn’t 
the people playing volleyball 
on the Cut, or the proliferation 
of shorts the last few days, 
though those were good clues. 
The first real sign of spring 
was a phone call I got this 
weekend — John Schano 
testing the depths of my 
interest in St. Louis Cardinal 
outfielder Milt Thompson.
That’s right. The Wasted 
Youth and Shattered Dreams 
Fantasy Baseball League is 
back, complete with all its 
ulcers and sleepless nights.
And even though my team is 
coming off its worst finish in 
the four-year history of the 
league (ninth in a ten-team 
league after three third-place 
finishes), I’m already begin­
ning to stockpile the Turns in 
expectation of a penant race.
For those of you who don’t 
dabble in fantasy baseball 
leagues, let me explain how 
they work. You “buy” a team of 
baseball players, and their 
real-life stats determine how 
your team does. You trade, 
replace injured players, and do 
all those other general man­
ager tasks for the sake of a few 
bucks and several tons of 
pride.'
It all sounds so innocent, but 
it often drives the participants 
to obscene lengths. How often 
does one get in a shouting 
match with close friends 
about the ethics of looting the 
last-place team for star play­
ers? How many people do you 
know that are proud to have 
stayed up for 59 straight hours 
to get the jump on his breth­
ren in the race to claim Frank 
Viola? You now know one — as 
irrational as that behavior 
seems, it will always be 
reasonable to me because it 
got me third place that year.
However, most of the effects 
of fantasy baseball are more 
subtle. I look at my notebooks 
from the past few years, and I 
wonder how I got any grades 
higher than a “D.” Instead of 
statistics notes, I can look back 
on a page of draft planning 
that listed my first five choices 
at each open roster spot. On 
the other hand, the page 
where I projected full-season 
numbers for my team probably 
did teach me some statistics.
You also start dreading the 
ring of the phone because it 
may be that deal that’s too 
I good to pass up (or at least will 
| take several hours to hash 
| out). You break out in a cold 
sweat every morning until you 
can look at the sports page.
Your mood for the day depends 
I entirely on how your pitchers 
| did the previous night. Ever 
try falling asleep at night after 
seeing an 11-2 score and not 
knowing how many of those 
runs belong to you? 
j The call of the baseball 
i sirens was tempting, but I was 
doing a good job fighting it. I
I hadn’t even bought the Bill 
Mazeroski baseball guide — 
the Bible of baseball maga­
zines, nor had I watched Peter 
! Mammons’ spring training 
Sports on ESPN. It was 
remakable restraint, really.
But along came Milt. Now 
*s time to get serious.

The CMU lacrosse club won 
its second game of the weekend 
this Sunday at 2 pm against 
Frostburg State University 14-
3. Both Saturday’s win against 
Washington and Jeffer-son Uni­
versity 18-4 and Sunday’s win 
were played on Tech Field. De­
spite numerous fouls by the 
Frostburg players and the over­
cast andincreasingly wetter and 
colder weather, the Tartans 
dominated the game and didn’t 
lose momentum.
The first period started with 
the face-off being taken by CMU, 
in white, who drove towards 
Frostburg’s (in red) goal but 
missed a shot on the goal. 
Frostburg drove three times to­
wards the CMU goal but failed 
to score and on the counterat­
tack number 22, fifth year archi­
tecture major Rob Kendall, 
scored the first of what would 
end up being four goals for him. 
Kendall scored again on a quick 
drive after a CMU throw-in when 
the Frostburg ball carrier was 
forced out-of-bounds. On a CMU 
counterattack after a deter­
mined Frostburg drive number 
37, doctoral physics student 
Bayard Johnson, scored despite 
an obvious slashing foul by the 
other side.
A series of back-and-forth 
drives between the two teams 
after the face-off resulted in a 
goal by number 11, senior me­
chanical engineeringmajorTodd 
Bredbenner. CMU took the face- 
off and drove for the Frostburg 
goal but was stopped by an 
offsides call by the referee. 
Frostburg took the ball back to­
wards the CMU goal but missed 
the shot. After an intensive pe­
riod around the goal, the ball 
was forced out and CMU sent it 
downfield on a long throw. The 
ball rolled out-of-bounds and 
Frostburg was on the offensive.
The Frostburg drive was 
stifled, and the ball was sent 
back downfield. CMU took con­
trol and drove towards the goal 
and a shot by Bredbenner only 
just missed the goal. Frostburg’s 
counter-drive also fell short due
!n•td o1Sh ShIdnt1Ituh1 s12nch AcT
to a ball loss and the ball switch­
ing hands. CMU’s drive shot at 
the goal but it was blocked by 
Frostburg s goalie, resulting in 
another back-and-forth set of 
drives ending with a determined 
CMU drive and another goal by 
Bredbenner, who would have 
three goals at the end of the 
game.
On the face-off, Frostburg was 
called for illegal procedure in 
the neutral zone and CMU took 
the ball but missed its first shot. 
On a pass seconds later, Kendall 
scored his third goal of the half 
to put the Tartans up 6-0. CMU 
was called for illegal procedure 
on the face-off, and Frostburg 
drove down the field.
With 45 seconds left in the 
period, Frostburg drove into 
CMU territory but a ball steal 
brought the ball back into 
Frostburg’s side of the field. The 
red goalie took the ball to half­
field but dropped it out-of- 
bounds and CMU took it back 
down the field for a score by 
number three, Eric Stonesiefer. 
With 20 seconds left in the pe­
riod, Frostburg was called for
F12-Sr IdShm1s n2tc !hcstTuhm t1hhntchol
Samuel Greenfield/Tartan Asst. Art Editor
illegal procedure on the face-off. 
CMU took control of the ball but 
lost it and Frostburg drove to­
wards the goal with 12 seconds 
left but failed to score.
Frostburg came out onto the 
field in the beginning of the sec­
ond period and out-scored CMU 
2-1 in the period. The face-off 
was taken by Frostburg but 
strong defensive play prevented 
a goal. After CMU took a time­
out in order to take back the 
momentum of the game, both 
teams drove back-and-forth in 
numerous attempts to score. 
CMU was able to stop the pat­
tern and keep the ball in the 
Frostburg territory with the help 
of an offsides call on the other 
team.
Frostburg came back with a 
lightning-fast drive down the 
field but failed to convert the 
push. The ball continued to move 
back-and-forth with a pushing 
foul by Frostburg keeping a long 
Tartan drive alive. The drive 
was for naught and Frostburg 
drove back, keeping the ball in 
the CMU goal area. When a

Tartans, Frostburg called a time­
out to regroup in order to try to 
make the most of its opportu­
nity. The attempt failed as strong 
defensive play and an intercep­
tion sent the ball back up the 
field, and another series of back- 
and-forth movement happened.
After a few drives the scoring 
occurred quickly. CMU’s num­
ber nine, Chris Wells, scored on 
a fast pass-dominated drive. The 
face-off was taken by Frostburg, 
which drove toward the CMU 
goal and scored. Frostburg re­
peated this move with a foul 
called on the Tartans during the 
drive. CMU took the face-off but 
was prevented from doing any­
thing with the ball by a deter­
mined defense, and the Tartans 
received another foul with only 
seconds left. The half ended with 
a score of 8-2 in favor of CMU.
The second half started off 
with strong CMU drives despite 
Frostburg’s attempts to continue 
its momentum. Another 
Frostburg pushing foul kept a 
Tartan drive alive but strong 
defense prevented a score. An­
other foul kept the ball in Tar­
tan hands. Frostburg scored;- 
again halfway through the pe­
riod.
CMU took the face-off but" 
failed to convert. Frostburg! 
movedbackup the field, but was’ 
stopped. Frostburg kept the ball1 
in the attack zone until the Tar-’ 
tans intercepted a pass and tried 
to drive down the field. The Tar­
tans took the ball down the field 
and kept it in the attack zone for 
a while.
Control kept the ball in CMU’sJ' 
hands and in the attack zone but' 
the team failed to score. 
Frostburg grabbed the ball and 
drove for the goal but failed to' 
score.
A missed pass let the Tartansi 
move the ball back up the field 
and number 80, John Seekings, ; 
scored a goal. After an out-of- 
bounds call and a time-out, 
Frostburg had the ball deep in 
CMU territory. An interception ’ 
by CMU sent the ball the lengtli 
of the field, but the period ended 
before anyone could convert.
The Tartans took the face-off 
of the new period on an illegal 
procedure call on Frostburg.' 
Their drive ended with a blocked 
shot by the Frostburg goalie and 
a field-spanning pass deep into 
CMU territory. CMU drove the 
ball back up the field and num­
ber 18, freshman H&SS student 
Travis Warren scored his first 
goal. The Tartans kept up the 
pressure over the next few min­
utes. A slashing foul was called 
on Frostburg and the Tartans 
kept up the attack with Seeking^ 
scoring his second goal on a 10* 
yard running shot. Frostburg 
took the face-off but CMU stole,, 
the ball and both teams drove, 
back-and-forth until Kendall 
scored his final goal.
The rest of the game saw both 
teams trying to score with quick 
drives. As rain fell and with sec­
onds left, Seekings scored the,; 
last goal to put CMU up 14-3.
CMU is 3-0 with wins this, 
weekend and last weekend’s win 
over Slippery Rock, 6-0. Coach 
Bill Elliot says, “[We were] good • 
in the first half, sloppy in the 
third period and better in the

to Pitt and looking good.”
Crew Team brings out 
oars for spring season
By TRACY HAYES
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
The Carnegie Mellon Crew 
Club started its on-water sea­
son training last Wednesday.
Since school started, the team 
has been in winter training — 
working on the ergometers (row­
ing machines) every morning at 
6:15, and running five miles ev­
ery Saturday. Some members 
even lift weights regularly.
“It’s not one’s strength, but 
rather one’s technique that wins 
the race,” says senior Sarah 
Gibby. It is very important to 
work on rowing form. Some 
members went to Princeton for 
indoor training January 11 and 
12.
At Princeton, the team worked 
on techniques in the tanks (in­
door, stationary boats to prac­
tice on).
The on-water season started 
Wednesday, and the team has 
one month to practice before the 
first meet, on April 4 at Johns 
Hopkins University in Balti­
more, Md.
The team will also attend the 
Govemer’s Cup in Charleston 
W.Va., April 11 and 12, and the 
Mid-American Collegiate Row­
ing Championships in Colum­
bus, May 2.
Gibby says the team is looking 
forward hopefully to qualifying 
for the Dad-Vail races in Phila­
delphia May 7-9.
To qualify the team must be
ranked in the top 12 of the 40 or ! 
50 teams that enter for each ! 
event.
Every year since the club was i 
formed in 1988, the team has 
sent crews to the Dad-Vail to 
compete in various events.
“The Carnegie Mellon Crew ' 
Club does respectably well for al: 
Division III school, compared', 
with other Division III schools, 
and some Carnegie Mellon crews* 
are even excellent,” says head-: 
coach Liz Winter.
Crew Club president, senior ; 
Opal Perry, said, “We’re looking ( 
forward to having the alumni/ ; 
graduate crew, the undergradu­
ate racing crew and our new’ j 
novices rowing this spring sea- i 
son.”
The only “home” meet this sea­
son will be a Carnegie Mellon, i 
Pitt, Duquesne, and West Vir- j 
ginia scrimmage.
Also at home are all the i 
fundraisers that the Crew Club ; 
has to keep the club alive.
Funding is low, and the team ! 
has to pay its coach and pay for ‘ 
materials for repairs—the team ! 
members do any repairs that j 
are needed themselves in order >' 
to save money.
Past fundraisers include ' 
Ergomania and a telephone 
drive to raise money from : 
alumni.
Next, the team is planning to 
sell t-shirts and sweatshirts “at 
Carnival and during some sunny 
spring days.”

14The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 9 March 1992
Women lose hope for NCAA title
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Assistant News Editor
The 1992 women’s basketball 
season that saw a 14-game win­
ning streak ended with a two- 
game losing streak that dropped 
the Tartans out of contention for 
an NCAA Division III tourna­
ment bid. The Tartans went into 
the University of Chicago game 
ranked third in the Mid-Atlan- 
tic Region and tied for the Uni­
versity Athletic Association lead, 
but the Maroons’ 52-45 upset 
victory and a season-ending 83- 
62 pounding at the hands of 
Washington University extin­
guished the post-season flame.
The Chicago game was one of 
the worst games of the year for 
both teams. The Tartans shot 
only .276 and commited 24 turn­
overs; the Maroons hit an even 
29 percent and turned the ball 
over 28 times.
Given those numbers, one 
wouldn’t be surprised to hear 
that the game was even most of 
the way. The Maroons opened
up two six-point leads in the 
first half, but the Tartans 
stormed back both times.
In fact, the Tartans went on a 
six-point run late in the period 
to tie the game at 20, but then 
went scoreless for the final four 
minutes. Chicago forward Tina 
Klawinski put the Maroons up 
22-20 with 2:35 left, and the 
teams traded misses until the 
half.
In the second half, the offense 
picked up a little: Chicago shot 
less, but shot .346 from the floor 
(as opposed to .250 in the first 
half). Carnegie Mellon had a 
better percentage and more 
shots from the floor, but Carn­
egie Mellon got fewer chances 
from the free throw line while 
Chicago received more.
With about 10 minutes left, 
Chicago opened the game up 
with an 11-2 run; with 5:47 left, 
the Tartans trailed 39-30. 
Sophomore Jeanine Megahan 
scored five of her game-high 14 
points in an 8-1 response that 
left the Tartans down by two
with three minutes left. 
Unfortuately, Carnegie Mellon 
could get no closer than three 
points and were unable to hit on 
two three-point opportunities in 
the final 30 seconds.
In addition to Megahan’s 14 
points, senior forward Amy 
Buxbaum added 10 and senior 
guard Katie Fahey scored seven. 
Buxbaum’slO rebounds was the 
team high, and Megahan added 
seven. Chicago forwards Kath­
leen Abbott and Tina Klawinski 
led the Maroons with 11 and 
nine points respectively.
Although the Tartans were 
still mathematically alive, post­
season action was highly un­
likely by the time Saturday’s 
game with the Washington Uni­
versity Bears rolled around.
Even with a Tartan win, Car­
negie Mellon would need help 
from Rochester (playing Emory) 
and Brandeis (playing Chicago) 
to have the tiebreakers for the 
conference’s automatic bid go in 
their favor. Unfortunately, the 
results of the other games be­
came a moot point as the Bears, 
with some help from the offi­
cials, rolled to a 21-point win.
Even though the Bears played 
a very good game, one has to 
wonder how much of a crimp it 
put in the Tartan game plan to 
give Washington 24 of 40 min­
utes in the bonus (including the 
final 15:30 of the game).
The numbers were more un­
even in the first half — Wash­
ington went to the line 16 times 
while the Tartans had four at­
tempts — as the officials called 
more Bear fouls in the second 
half after the game was out of 
reach.
But the officials didn’t beat 
the Tartans as badly as the Bears 
did. Washington guard Carolyn 
Royce’s five for seven perfor­
mance from three-point range 
(20 points overall) and 21 points 
from forward Michele Lewis did 
the bulk of the damage, but the 
team as a whole shot well.
At the half, the Tartans were 
down 40-28, but it looked as if 
they might still have a chance.
CMU men finish with loss
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Assistant News Editor
The men’s basketball team 
dropped both games of a two- 
game road trip to finish its 1991- 
92 season. The losses dropped 
the Tartans to an 8-14 overall 
record, as well as a 3-11 Univer­
sity Athletic Association mark.
Last Thursday’s game against 
the University of Chicago went 
right down to the wire. Sopho­
more guard Rony Johns nailed 
b^ck-to-back three-pointers, and 
spphomore forward Charlie 
Connors hit a free throw to tie 
the game at 67 with 1:25 left. 
Unfortunately for the Tartans, 
previously scoreless Chicago 
¦guard Matt Benz hit a three- 
pointer from the top of the key to 
ipiftt the Maroons ahead with 44 
Tjfflconds left. The Maroons were 
able to widen their lead at their 
free-throw line as the Tartans 
couldn’t get even in the final 30 
seconds.
The Tartans led by as much as 
five early in the contest, but went
c.Qld in the final five minutes of 
the half. Two Chicago baskets in 
the last two minutes tied the 
game at 31, proving the Ma­
roons had picked up a step since 
the Tartans pummeled them by 
26 in Pittsburgh.
Ultimately, CMU was done in 
by poor free throw shooting
(three of 11) and accurate Chi­
cago three-point marksmanship 
(seven of 11). The Tartans once 
again broke out on top, but an
11-3 Chicago run put the Ma­
roons up by seven with six min­
utes to play. CMU started a small 
run but were pushed back to 67— 
60 with four minutes left, setting 
up their final comeback.
Johns led the Tartans with 22 
points, including six three-point­
ers; sophomore Mike Hosni, the 
team’s overall leading scorer, 
added 18, and Connors scored
11 and led all players with seven 
rebounds. Three Maroons scored 
in double figures, led by senior 
forward Matt Krapf’s 18 points.
On Sunday, the results were 
no better for the Tartans as the 
Bears of Washington University 
downed the Tartans, 84-69. The 
Tartans stayed close early in the 
contest, but the Bears extended 
their lead to double digits early 
in the second half and only briefly 
looked back.
The Bears’ fortunes hinged 
largely on the performance of 
forward Charlie Borsheim. 
Borsheim scored eight points in 
the first half, but exploded for 17 
in the second half including six 
straight points. The Bears also 
capitalized on the absence of 
Connors from the lineup. When 
Connors, the Tartans’ top scorer 
and rebounder, sat with four
fouls at the 14-minute mark, the 
Bears opened up the game, 
which the Tartans had closed to 
within four. A 13-2 run in the 
final four minutes pushed the 
Washington lead as high as 19, 
but the Tartans scored a few 
late baskets to bring the final 
margin back down to 15 points.
Three Tartans ended the sea­
This was, after all, the team 
that had orchestrated two come­
back wins over the Bears last 
year. However, a 12—0 run early 
in the second half sent the Tar­
tans reeling, and a 12-2 run a 
few minutes later finished the 
job, leaving the Tartans down, 
69-37, with 10 minutes to play.
The Bears lead widened to 36 
at one point, but the Tartans 
situation evened out. In the fi­
nal 8:30 after the 36-point mar­
gin, the Tartans outscored 
Washington 23-8, but it was too 
little, too late.
Buxbaum led the Tartans with 
a season-high 25 points and 12 
rebounds. In addition, with her 
sixth point of the contest, Bux­
baum also became the third Tar­
tan player to score 1000 career 
points, ending her career with 
1,019. She joins Kathleen 
Segmiller (1978-82, 1,595 
points) and Lisa Lightner (1985- 
89, 1,346 points) in the thou­
sand-point club.
The Tartans end the season 
with a 18-6 record, as well as a
10-4 second-place mark in the 
UAA. In addition to her 1,019 
career points, Buxbaum also fin­
ished the season as the Tartans’ 
leading scorer (12.7 points per 
game) and rebounder (10.4 re­
bounds per game). Megahan, 
with 11.1 points per game, was 
the only other Tartan with a 
double-figure scoring average.

Saturday in the Strip
Pittsburgh’s Strip District: Doing It Right
By ANDREW COSENTINO
Tartan Staffwriter
It’s Saturday morning, you’ve 
heard some great things about 
Pittsburgh’s Strip District, and 
today you’re finally going, but 
take it from an experienced 
Strip-comber, you need a plan. 
With the right plan, Saturday in 
the Strip can mean hitting the 
hot spots of ethnic taste delights, 
wholesale novelties, and rich 
personalities on Penn Avenue. 
Random sampling, however, is 
just that — random. To experi­
ence the Strip and the best it has 
to offer not only requires a 
healthy appetite, but that you 
know where to look as well. It’s 
taken some time, but I’ve finally 
gotten working the Strip down 
to a science. Take my advice 
with you into the Strip along 
with some friends and an empty 
stomach, and do it right the first 
time.
Parking for the 
Top Banana
Get to the Strip by about eleven 
o’clock, and don’t try parking on 
the main street, Penn Avenue. 
You probably won’t find a spot. 
You’ll do much better to stay on 
Smallman Street (parallel to 
Penn) on your way into the Strip, 
until the intersection of Small­
man and 2fl.st Street. Take a 
right onto 21st, drive about 
________&_______________________
thirty yards, and park in the lot 
of the Acme Banana Company 
warehouse. It’s free, it’s close to 
Penn Avenue, and it presents 
much less of a threat to your car 
than does the hustle and bustle 
of the main street.
Jump-Start at 
La Prima
For those people whose Fri­
day nights are a time set apart 
for fun and numbness, getting 
to the Strip feeling less than 
fresh should not be a problem 
for long. Tucked away on the left 
of 21st Street after it crosses 
Penn Avenue is La Prima 
Espresso Company, the perfect 
remedy to a cranky demeanor. 
On the sidewalk directly out­
side the shop, Mirella plays her 
accordion while Giuseppi, the 
chestnut roaster, gathers hot 
chestnuts from atop his barbe­
cue, wrapping them in cones of 
newspaper for La Prima patrons. 
Espresso and cappuccino can be 
found at a few places on the 
Strip, but La Prima has by far 
the best coffees (cappuccino, 
espresso, mocha), plus sinfully 
good pastries and Focaccia- 
bread sandwiches baked by big 
Antonio Branduzzi in the back 
of the shop. On Saturday morn­
ings, La Prima is a true coffee 
subculture, a haven where loyal 
patrons retreat to cast aside the
irritants of the week and sooth 
their souls with hot, aromatic, 
liquid joy. So enjoy the qualities 
of the best coffee shop in the 
Strip, and throw owner and con­
versationalist Sam Patti a ciao 
when leaving. You’ll know and 
like him well by then. ________
Fueled Up and Ready
Filled with the warm glow and 
energy that can come only from 
La Prima’s magic beans, you’re 
now ready to turn the corner of 
21 st Street and step out into the 
carnival atmosphere of Penn 
Avenue. To fully enjoy your caf­
feine high, go a short distance 
up the left side of Penn and en­
ter the pandemonium of Penn­
sylvania Macaroni. On Satur­
days, the big store buzzes with 
shrewd buyers of Italian spe­
cialties sold in bulk quantities. 
As you’re walking through the 
first room, jockeying for passage 
into the back, be sure to notice 
the variety of purchaseable gar- 
lic-bulb formations, particularly 
the garlic-bulb wreaths. They’re 
worth seeing, and they keep 
away evil spirits.
After whetting my appetite at 
La Prima, Pennsylvania Maca­
roni’s hectic back room is always 
a difficult one for me; the grab­
bing smell of sharp imported 
cheeses being hacked from 
wheels and sold many pounds at
a time to scurrying customers, 
huge cans of marinated arti­
chokes and roasted peppers, and 
olives of every variety curing in 
bin after bin, waiting to be 
scooped out with mini-shovels. 
There have been times when in 
a frenzy, I’ve grabbed a piece of 
crusty bread and eaten my Penn 
Mac purchases on the sidewalk 
outside. I highly recommend the 
picnic approach.
Street Eats
Stay away from the numerous 
conventional shishkebab-type 
vendors. Pork on a stick is good, 
but it’s a dime a dozen and there’s 
much better street food to be 
eaten. In fact, just outside Penn 
Mac and up the street to the left 
is sidewalk vending at its best 
Street Smoky Sammy’s Barbe­
cue comes as close to delicacy 
status as barbecue gets. You 
can’t miss Sammy. He’s the big 
guy with Smoky Sammy over­
alls, a huge straw hat, and a 
meat cleaver in his hand. This is 
not a man from the hot dog school 
of street vending. Sammy’s a 
caterer who, with his wife Renie, 
trucks his huge spit to the Strip 
every Saturday to give whole 
chickens, legs of lamb, racks of 
ribs, and pork shanks a few 
basted spins over the fire. While 
halfway through a pork barbe­
cue laid out on a Kaiser, ask 
Sammy to give the 15-minute 
history lesson on his tangy Caro­
lina and Texas sauces, the ones 
that have people licking their 
paws like kittens every week­
end. (Pssst! Friends of Sammy's 
gets to sample his home-made 
wine.)
The Entertainer
Directly across the street from 
Sammy is another celebrity of 
the Strip — Sal Grecco. Sal has 
the distinction of being the fun­
niest and only sidewalk CD 
salesman in Pittsburgh. As a 
friend, I won’t comment on his 
selection, but his prices are ex­
cellent, provided you bargain 
with him in his imaginary office. 
Don’t miss Sal Grecco. His 
schtick for selling CDs is lounge 
act material (and that’s being 
kind).
Feinberg's: The Mother of 
all Novelty Stores
From Sal Grecco’s, cross the 
street again and walk up the left 
side until you reach Mike 
Feinberg’s (on your way, be sure 
to get a sample of homemade 
fudge from the sidewalk fudge 
vender). Feinberg’s is a large 
store filled with everything 
that’s fun. You can spend hours 
in Feinberg’s, just setting off the
thousands of little animal noise- • 
making, walking, flying, siren- j 
sounding, and jumping toys; 
packed onto the shelves. Andj 
don’t worry, it takes a hell of a! 
lot to get kicked out. Plus,! 
Feinberg’s has every silly souve- j 
nir imaginable, some of thernj 
twenty years old. You’ll love this j 
place and will discover new and! 
ridiculous novelties each time: 
you go.
Presto! It’s Time to 
Eat Again
All right, even if you can’t eat; 
anymore, take a left out of | 
Feinberg’s and head up to Presto-

Pitt professor reaches out to maximum security prisoners
Pugliano provides inmates at W. Penitentiary with education
By ORYADASNA
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Does everyone deserve an 
education? The prevailing re­
sponse in the United States is 
“Yes, of course, everyone de­
serves an education.” Who, 
exactly, does “everyone” en­
tail? Does “everyone” entail 
thieves? Drug dealers? Rap­
ists? Murderers?
However, the answer be­
longs to Fiore Pugliano, an 
English professor at the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh. The ro­
tund, 46-year-old third gen­
eration Italian is single and 
lives alone. His activities out­
side of work include reading 
novels, followingthe Academy 
Awards, and coordinating a 
program which allows resi­
dents of a maximum security 
prison to take college courses.
Fiore Pugliano is in charge 
of the Pitt Prison Program at 
the State Correctional Insti­
tution in Pittsburgh-other­
wise known as “Western Peni­
tentiary.” Through the pro­
gram, men serving a life sen­
tence for murder have the op­
portunity to take courses such 
as Introduction to Poetry, In­
troduction to English, and Sta­
tistics.
The program was first 
started in the late 1960s when 
a group of inmates wrote a 
letter to the Community Col­
lege of Allegheny County ask­
ing if any professors would 
teach a few courses at the 
prison. The response was posi­
tive: four CCAC courses were 
offered the next semester at 
the prisonby volunteers. Soon 
after, the University of Pitts­
burgh joined the program and 
continued it, even after the 
Community College of Allegh­
eny County dropped out in 
1981.
Two hundred men attend
classes at Oakland’s Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh cam­
pus. The Pitt Prison Pro­
gram enables the resi­
dents ofWestem Peniten­
tiary to take courses at 
the prison for credit to­
wards a bachelor’s, 
master’s, or even a PhD. 
Degrees are offered in the 
communications, En­
glish, psychology, 
economics,and public ad­
ministration majors.
Approximately 30 in­
structors are needed to 
teach the program each 
week. Even after the state 
discontinued significant 
funding for the program, 
Pugliano had no trouble 
finding, mostly through 
the university, volunteers 
to teach the program. 
"Once you teach a course 
out there,” Pugliano says, 
“you’re hooked. It’s the 
kind of teaching experi­
ence people read about in 
books but never get to 
have.”
Pugliano took over af­
ter the first faculty mem­
ber in charge of the pro­
gram left the university.
“I was asked because of 
my personality. I’m easy­
going. I can handle people, 
paperwork, with as much 
—uh—decorum and pa­
tience as possible.” And easygo­
ing he is -— his relaxed manner, 
coupled with his dedication to 
the program, has allowed him to 
continue the program as coordi­
nator since 1975.
A good dose of courage is also 
helpful. Aside from the the ideo­
logical gratifications and indi­
vidual satisfaction of teaching 
prisoners, there is the inevitable 
fear factor. There, is definitely 
something threatening about 
being locked in a maximum se­
curity prison and having one- 
on-one contact with men who 
have been incarcerated for mur­
der, assault, rape, and a host of 
other crimes.
Security is exceedingly strin­
gent at Western Penitentiary. 
“When you go in for the first 
time-the first few times-it is very 
intimidating.” The main door of 
the prison complexis locked from 
the inside each time a visitor 
enters. “You hear a grinding 
sound almost like a knob on a
vault to get you in. Most of the 
people I’ve met down there [at 
Western Penitentiary] have 
been surprisingly supportive, 
helpful. You hear all these hor­
ror stories about how they’re 
anti-program, but I’ve never had 
a problem at all.”
In this business, even with 
support, dedication and tenac­
ity are a must. Opposition to 
federal programs to educate 
criminals is strong. A signifi­
cant percentage of the 
public feels that indi­
viduals incarcerated for 
major crimes do not de­
serve the privilege of 
education. Pugliano’s 
objection to this argu- 
mentispractical: “What 
we put into education is 
a fraction of the cost to 
keep them in jail for a 
year—which would ac­
complish nothing.”
But the main reason 
Fiore Pugliano is so 
deeply involved in the 
Pitt Prison Program is 
ideological. “I think you 
teach prisoners for the 
same reason that you 
teach any students. Why 
do I teach anyone any­
thing? To teach knowl­
edge, so [the students] 
can use it however they 
want. I don’t see it as 
teaching criminals— 
they’re just students.” 
“Logic says these 
people are here in a 
maximum security pri­
son because they com­
mitted a very serious 
crime, but it never came 
into my mind that they 
were criminals. They’re 
just students that I 
teach. [Preconceptions of 
criminals] just don’t fit 
into the teacher-student 
equation.”
Indeed, the students’ status 
as major felons doesn’t faze 
Pugliano. In fact, he is quite 
adamant about destroyingpreju- 
dices towards students who are 
prisoners. “I have this basic be­
lief in people, their dignity, hu­
manity. We have this label of 
‘prisoner.’ We do terrible injus­
tices by usingthis label. It’s easy 
because people don’t have to deal 
with them [the prisoners] on 
other terms. The prisoners think 
‘I am a murderer, burglar, drug
dealer. People see me for my 
crime.’ It can be very debili­
tating.”
••••••••
Inside the classroom, then, 
the men’s criminal status 
takes a back seat to the course 
material. The students are 
“very involved in class par­
ticipation, class discussion. 
The discussions are very in­
volved, very animated. 
They’ve had many more ex­
periences and are willing to 
talk about the experiences.” 
Other instructors at West­
ern Penitentiary also find the 
students eager to learn. A 
former participant in Pug­
liano’s program and instruc­
tor of Freshman Composition 
and Fiction Writing at the 
prison, Tina Calabro, found 
“some enthusiastic students— 
tuned in, anxious to learn, to 
impress the teacher. Three- 
quarters ofthe students were 
motivated, especially with 
writing and self-expression. 
Some wanted to be published 
fiction writers.”
Although the students may 
be enthusiastic about receiv­
ing an education, their skills 
are not always stellar. “We 
have many more learning 
skills problems. They’re a lot 
more prevalent [here in 
prison].” Learning disabili­
ties, such as dyslexia, present 
obstacles to the students 
against reading and writing 
fluently.
When asked if these dis­
abilities are a problem which 
hinder the learning process, 
Pugliano replied, “No. I’ve 
had people who applied them­
selves and put the extra time 
and effort to develop the skills 
they’re lacking and do well in 
the end.”
“The biggest problem is 
people who lose heart. They

Get ready for Greek Sing
By STEFANTE MILLER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter 
& LAURA PALANKER
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Under the auspices of senior 
industrial management major 
Danielle Crail and junior politi­
cal science major Jason Bare- 
ford, Spring 1992’s Greek Sing 
Committee has the event well 
under way. Eighteen fraterni­
ties and sororities will partici­
pate in this Friday’s charity 
event, performing music to suit 
every taste, from Kappa Kappa 
Gamma’s Carmen to Kappa 
Sigma’s Saturday Night Live.
This year, new chair Crail for 
organizing the event had a diffi­
cult time getting the informa­
tion needed to get the show go­
ing. Although the general 
makeup of the show is the same 
as last year’s, Tom Andersen, 
last year’s assistant chair, said, 
“The past chair and this year’s 
chair didn’t work on the same 
wavelength for things like room 
reservation and deadline. 
Danielle basically had to tackle 
the whole thing.”
One thing that is different this 
year from past years is the tim­
ing of each act. In previous years, 
the participants were given one 
and a half minutes to set up the
sets, seven and a half minutes to 
perform and then one and a half 
minutes to take down their sets. 
This year, each group will have 
eleven minutes for the set-up, 
performance, and take-down, 
and will have to plan accord­
ingly. The old method created 
confusion between the timers 
and performers, Andersen said.
The assistant chair for corpo­
rate sponsorship is junior infor­
mation and decision systems 
major Jennifer Heid. This year’s 
sponsor is Magna Graphics on 
South Craig Street. Magna 
Graphics is printing the Greek 
Sing brochures, and will take 
about $500 off printing costs. In 
addition to the show schedule, 
the program will contain ads 
from local businesses. Each 
house is required to sell a mini­
mum of $150 of ads to cover 
program costs. The proceeds 
from the event itself will go to 
Pittsburgh Blood Bank to help 
pay for a machine that sepa­
rates blood from plasma.
Unfortunately, Delta Upsilon 
willnotparticipateinGreekSing 
this year. DU, which placed first 
in their division in both the 1990 
and 1991 competitions, will not 
comment on why it has opted 
not to sing. “Delta Upsilon will 
not participate in this year’s
Greek Sing due to many unfore­
seen circumstances,” said jun­
ior industrial management ma­
jor and DU brother Matthew 
Gile. Crail also refused to ex­
plain DU’S absence, saying that 
“[DU was] the biggest supporter 
through the whole thing and did 
all the mandatory parts ofGreek 
Sing, but can’t make the final 
show.”
Senior economics major Dou­
glas Borthwick, in charge of in­
viting the “celebrity judges,” has 
announced that the judges from 
CMU will be Christopher 
Josephs, professor of acting who 
also works with Pittsburgh Play­
house; and Saul Markowitz, as­
sistant director of public rela­
tions for CFA and his wife. 
Carolyn Violi, performer with 
Pittsburgh Playhouse; 
Roseanna Irwin, vocal coach; 
Winnie Flynn, productionist for 
Holiday Inn Hotels in Pitts­
burgh; JosephMacGoldrick, pro­
fessor of music at Point Park 
College, will also be a judge for 
the event.
Greek Sing will be on March 
13 at 7:30 pm at Soldiers and 
Sailors Memorial. Tickets go on 
sale today at Skibo Info Desk.

Disabilities Awareness Program 
creates understanding about handicaps
By MARNI BLAKE
Tartan Staffwriter
Most people take simple acts 
such as walking up stairs or 
talking with friends for 
granted, and in the course of a 
day most people do not con­
sider what their lives would be 
like if they couldn’t do these 
things because of an illness or 
disability.
But for the many disabled 
people on campus and else­
where, the current goal is to 
bridge the gap of understand­
ing between disabled people 
and the rest of society. Pity is 
not what disabled people want
— they simply look forward to 
when they may function with 
the same efficiency as “every­
one else.”
Jonathan Berger, a junior 
English major who is hearing 
impaired, saw the need for 
people to have a greater un­
derstanding about disabilities. 
The Disabilities Awareness 
Program on March 5 and 6 
was Berger’s idea of a way to 
give students at CMU a greater 
awareness of what it means to 
be disabled. Berger explained 
the purpose of the four-part 
program was “to get people to
understand,' so then they may 
apply their understanding to 
different situations with dis­
abled people.” The program also 
coincides with the recent pass­
ing of the American Disabilities 
Act, which prevents discrimina­
tion against the handicapped.
The first event of the program 
was an informal discussion held 
with CMU alumna DeeDee 
Fink(‘82) and several students. 
Fink, who lost the use of her legs 
in a car accident, led a friendly 
discussion which was very suc­
cessful in creating an atmo­
sphere in which everyone could 
comfortably communicate their 
concerns.
Friday’s Soup & Substance 
program was entitled “Beyond 
Attitude and Architecture: Over­
coming Physical and Psychologi­
cal Barriers.” Linda Dickerson 
(’81), a leading advocate of the 
American Disabilities Act 
(ADA), spoke aboutthe ADAand 
its effectiveness.
She believes that the main 
hindrance to the act’s effective­
ness is the public’s lack of knowl­
edge about issues facing disabled 
people. However, she believes 
that when more people become 
aware of disability issues, the 
ADA will be very successful in
integrating handicapped 
people further into main­
stream society.
Comedian Kathy Buckley 
performed as the final event 
in the program. Buckley is one 
of the first hearing-impaired 
comedians. Berger explained, 
“Although the main point of 
the program focused on seri­
ous aspects of handicaps, we 
wanted a comedy act because 
of its positive image. We don’t 
want people to feel sorry for 
us.”
A ramp design project dis­
play in Grey Matter, done by 
the Introduction to Architec­
ture class, accompanied the 
program’s events. The projects 
showed many ideas for wheel­
chair accommodation, includ­
ing ramps and other ways of 
increasing accessibility to 
Skibo, MMC, and CFA.
With the passage ofthe ADA 
as well as successful small 
community programs such as 
CMU’s, society is quickly be- 
comingmore aware ofthe prob­
lems that disabled people face. 
As for disabled people, they 
are gaining a new confidence 
because they are now being 
backed by society more than 
ever before.Ignore the rules of society — become a bounty hunter
Mrs. Harding, a resentful old 
woman who, after twenty years 
of teaching, has it up to HERE 
with first-graders, walks up to 
one of her little hooligans — 
who’s currently carving animals 
into his desk — and asks him, 
“So, Stephen... what doyou want 
to be when you grow up?” 
Stephen, who’s wearing a pa­
jama top instead of a t-shirt, 
because his grandmother is tak­
ing care of him while his parents 
are away, jerks his head up, mo­
mentarily forgetting about his 
animal masterpiece and eagerly 
answers, “A brain surgeon! Or a 
heart surgeon! Or maybe a 
teacher! Or maybe I’ll be a den­
tist! Or maybe a....”
Mrs. Harding smiles, know­
ing that she only has two more 
years of baby-sitting these brats 
until she can retire answers, 
/‘That’s nice Stephen. Now, run 
along and go play with the other 
children.”

In my book, choosing a job is 
up there with blindfolded 
chainsaw dental surgery. I re­
member when I was five and all 
that mattered to me when choos­
ing a job was the “funness” fac­
tor involved, which pretty much 
consisted of asking the question, 
“How much fun is involved with 
this job?” If the answer was ei­
ther “a lot” or “a ton,” then that
UFE, THE UNIVERSE, 
AND STEVE
by Stephen Glicker
was what I wanted to do for a 
living.
Today there’s so much to worry 
about—where’s the job located, 
how much does it pay, what’s 
the dress code like? Why can’t 
choosing a job be a simple pro­
cess?
“Hello, Mr. Glicker, I’m from 
the automatic job placement 
agency.”
“Hello.”
“Now according to my records, 
it says here that you’d like to 
either bealiontamerora water- 
ski instructor.”
“That’s right.”
“Well, there has recently been 
an opening in our Hawaii office 
and we’ve managed to arrange 
your new job — you’ll be teach­
ing lions how to water-ski.”
“Cool!”
Now wouldn’t that be a lot 
easier?
Of course, life doesn’t work 
that way. Life is hard and com­
plex and all that stuff. And along 
that line, jobs were never meant 
to be fun. A job is supposed to be 
work, and when is work funl
Over the years, I must have 
heard that statement a thou­
sand times, been told about the 
horrors of finding a fun job in 
“the real world,” and that you 
should take what you can get. 
After hearing this garbage for 
most of my life, you know what? 
I don’t care.
That’s right, I’ve had more 
than my share of “real life.” I’m 
tired of taking courses I don’t 
like, doing what I’m “supposed
to do,” and playing by the rules. 
So, I have decided to stop play­
ing by the rules. I don’t care 
what it takes, but my job is going 
to be fun.
Movie director, discjockey, as­
tronaut, TV anchorman ... jobs 
I’ve always wanted but been told 
by just about everyone I could 
never have. Jobs which are “too 
hard” to get. Jobs which are sim­
ply impossible for “someone like 
me.”
Well, I’m not listening any­
more. Maybe if I don’t play by 
the rules then the rules won’t 
apply to me.
Sure, you can call me foolish, 
you can even call me crazy, but 
over the last couple of months 
I’ve been thinking about my 
friend Kevin a lot.
Kevin was a friend of mine 
who graduated from Penn six 
years ago. After graduating, he 
received dozens of great job of­
fers, all jobs any “normal” per­
son would love to have, but Kevin 
turned them all down to pursue 
his lifelong dream ¦— to become 
a movie producer.
Everyone I knew laughed at 
him and called him crazy.
“What were the chances oihim 
becoming a movie producer?” 
they said.
“How many movie producers 
are there in the world to begin 
with? Fifty? One hundred, at 
most? What’s the chance that he 
would become a movie pro­
ducer?”
Even I, his friend, thought he 
was crazy.
But Kevin didn’t care. He just 
picked himself up, went to Hol­
lywood, got a job in the mailroom 
of some big movie company, and 
worked towards his dream.
It’s six years later, he’s the 
Executive Vice-President of Tri- 
Star Pictures, and he’s about to 
produce his first major motion 
picture. And he’s not even thirty 
yet.
And I called him crazy — I’m 
so ashamed.
But rather than dwell on the 
error of my ways, I’ve decided to 
follow in Kevin’s footsteps — to 
blaze my own path and write my 
own rules. I’m not going to work 
for some big corporation, push­
ing paper and pencils. No sir, 
I’m applying for fun jobs, jobs 
people would be envious of, jobs 
which are cool.
So far my list consists of Late
Night with David Letterman, 
MTV, Industrial Light and 
Magic, a Broadway press agency, 
and StarTrek. Sure, the chances 
of getting a job with most of 
these people are slim, but I have 
to try.
Sure, I’m crazy. Sure, I’m tak­
ing huge risks. Sure, I might 
end up without a job and penni­
less. Believe me, I’ve heard it
from everyone and from all di­
rections.
And I’ll be sure to repeat it to 
all my interviewers next week.

Cows create milk cartel to control prices
gy »k» RyOkq
far'tan Staffwriter
Imagine if gas cost somewhere 
between $1.99 and $2.19 per 
in.^The world would grind to 
a complete halt, wouldn’t it? In­
dustrial production would stop
at least slow to a snail’s pace, 
prices would increase beyond the 
reach of most consumers, and 
the economic systems of most 
industrial countries would 
crumble, implying that all aid 
by those countries to the Third 
\Vorld would dry up. This is un­
less, of course, one of the major 
economic and military world 
powers decides to do something 
about it. If that happened, ev­
erything would return to nor­
mal and all of our lives would go 
on quite nicely.
Now I realize that the price of 
a barrel of oil pretty much dic­
tates how much gasoline costs, 
but gas is concrete in most of our 
lives as opposedto a barrel of oil. 
No one really goes around with a 
barrel of crude oil strapped to 
the back of their car — I think. 
The point is that gasoline, fuel, 
is near and dear to the daily 
lives of most people |n America. 
The fact remains, however, that 
it is still one of the cheapest 
things an American consumer 
can buy.
To illustrate this point, let’s 
take an example of something 
that seems much more impor­
tant, on a direct biological con­
sumption level at least, and is 
much more expensive by the 
'gallon or any other size — milk. 
The last time I was in a grocery 
store, milk cost somewhere be­
tween $1.99 and $2.19 per gal­
lon. That’s almost a dollar more
DRAGGED, KICKING &
SCREAMING INTO...
by Bob Dixon
In terms of plain old home 
economics, it would be a lot 
cheaper to buy a gallon of gas 
and feed it to your kids than to 
do the same with a gallon of 
milk. What’s the problem with 
this?
Well, gasoline and petroleum 
products, in general, aren’t the 
best things for your digestive 
system, or any other biological 
system for that matter. This is 
especially true if you happen to 
be partially or entirely aquatic 
and live in any previously pris­
tine bay named after an English 
nobleman.
Milk is the thing you’re sup­
posed to drink for strong teeth 
and healthy bones. Gasoline is 
the stuff that makes the cars — 
which make the exhaust which 
depletes the ozone layer — run.
The house that Jack built with 
gasoline powered machines is 
about to get the roof melted off 
by ultraviolet rays. In a country 
that is supposedly trying to get 
healthy by jogging, working out, 
and aerobicizing, one of the 
things that supposed to be good 
for you (“Milk is good food”) and 
as wholesome as Mom and apple 
pie costs more than something 
that acts as a catalyst for global 
pollution.
Aside from the pollution as- think that supply and demand
pect, what about all those com­
mercials that say how good milk 
is? I’ll be the last one to believe 
advertising, especially advertis­
ing about anything you drink, 
and aside from beer commer­
cials giving you a good body and 
a hot sex partner, is there any­
thing that says it gives you some­
thing? All other beverages — 
including light beer — promise 
to take off three to seven hun­
dred pounds in three hours. Milk 
at least says it makes you 
healthier. What was the first 
drink you ever had? Milk — 
Mom’s or canned, one or the 
other.
It seems ridiculous that the 
United States government pays 
farmers not to produce extra 
crops but allows the products of 
the dairy industry — American 
products which require only lim­
ited shipping — to be more ex­
pensive than petroleum prod­
ucts purchased from halfway 
around the world from people 
we supposedly don’t like.
The shipping and handling 
alone for gas should send the 
prices through Jack’s ultravio­
let melted roof. And whatever 
happened to buying American 
products over imported? 
America has milk and oil — 
Texas, Alaska, and Louisiana 
folks. Isn’t it ironic to see a “Buy 
American” bumper sticker on a 
car running on Iranian oil and 
gas?
Now in talking to people about 
this column, the most common 
support for cheaper gasoline 
comes from the assertion that 
more of it is used. Economies of 
scale yield cheaper prices in the 
marketplace. Somehow, I don’t
should apply to things that you 
feed to babies and small chil­
dren to make them grow up into 
healthy, intelligent human be­
ings. And we all know that if the 
federal government of the United 
States of America wanted to, it 
could sufficiently manipulate the 
national economy to make milk 
seventy-five cents a gallon to­
morrow.
So what is the answer? Is there 
really a problem? Does anyone 
really care that it would be easier
for a family just above the pov­
erty line and not qualified for 
social welfare to buy a gallon of 
gas and poison themselves than 
to buy a gallon of milk and feed 
their kids? Should we wage war 
against cows if they don’t in­
crease production and lower 
costs? What would that accom­
plish but some spilled milk and 
increased prices in terms of 
cleanup and rebuilding udders?
I don’t know what the answer 
is. But I know there’s a problem
Ramsey Hong/Tartan Art staff 
when the use of an automobile is 
more valued than a healthy hu­
man being. Somewhere out 
there, there’s' an economist who 
does know the answer. We just 
have to find him and convince 
him that Mom, apple pie, and 
milk should not cost more than 
imported gas and oil.

By i&0A& R&LyV
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Macondo, located at 406 South 
Craig Street, parallels the 
world’s developing global out­
look. One of the main attrac­
tions of the Craig Street shops, 
Macondo offers a variety of in­
teresting and distinctive mer­
chandise that will entice most 
any shopper or browsing stu- 
mt.
Owned- by Bill Bollendorf, 
Macondo sells “fashion, folk art, 
jewelry, accessories, and gifts 
from America and around the 
world.” The store’s bright hand- 
painted sign beckons from the 
street level and is the first indi­
cator of Macondo’s friendly at­
mosphere, where every inch of 
wall and floor space is crammed 
¡with colorful hand-crafted 
clothes and artwork. Shopping 
at Macondo is an educational 
and cultural experience; every 
item has a tag telling at least 
what it is and where it was made. 
According to employee Tina 
Gelfand, the store sells pieces 
from Nepal, Mexico, Tibet, In­
donesia, India, Morocco, Malay­
sia, and Guatemala, to name a 
few. Much of the art comes from 
Haiti; the store, first located in 
Philadelphia and on the New 
Jersey shore, sold only Haitian 
items originally. Macondo has 
been at its present location since 
1979 and is now the only one in 
operation.
Macondo’s stock features 
great clothing for both sexes, as 
'veil as kids. Basics, like t-shirts, 
mock turtlenecks, shorts, and 
Pants, come in all sizes and col­
ors and at very reasonable prices 
(the most expensive tee-shirt 
costs $15).
Less mainstream items like 
batik shirts, leggings, Mexican 
Pullovers, Guatemalan patch­
work pants, cotton shoes, and 
satin pajama bottoms make up 
Macondo’s exclusive line of af­
fordable international fashion. 
The store’s accessories out­
shine the appeal of the clothes 
because of the huge selection 
andlow prices. Bags of brightly 
Woven cotton or leather, scarves 
from India, and hats are a few 
^ngs available to enhance your 
l°ok, but the biggest attraction 
Macondo’s line is the jewelry
selection. Earrings, bracelets, 
necklaces, rings, and hairpieces 
abound in a large case and all 
over the walls of the store as 
well. Made mostly from sterling 
silver, the pieces feature stones 
such as malachite, lapis, onyx, 
amethyst, and turquoise. Ear­
rings in particular come in all 
shapes and sizes, from tiny studs 
to huge hoops, with prices that 
are tough to beat. The selection 
of pendants, crystals,'and amu­
lets is equally good. It’s tough to 
look at the jewelry selection at 
this store and not find some­
thing appealing.
Not to be forgotten, the art for 
sale in the shop is incredible. 
Elaborately framed paintings 
and mirrors, masks of all sizes 
and colors, baskets, statuettes, 
and sculpture fill all the space 
not occupied by clothing, and 
everything is for sale, which 
gives the store a gallery quality. 
As with the clothing, each piece 
of art bears an explanatory tag. 
The masks, the most impressive 
and abundant items, are unique 
and range from $6 to $170, and 
make innovative gifts or room
5h1Ssuh1s •cu2- St ’SIc2-c Sh1
decorations. The art for sale in­
side Macondo is central to the 
atmosphere as well as the offer­
ings of the store.
According to Gelfand, the most 
popular items are Indian print

dn--12 T1rcj sth11t r1p1r c2 Vcutd xhSnm Vth11tl
shirts, all of the jewelry, belts, 
tapestries, and Afghani socks. 
The store also features rare 
items like elaborate shadow pup­
pets, African drums, and lava 
lamps to liven up the merchan­
dise selection and variety. So if 
you are looking for a new source 
of clothes and accessories, try 
Macondo, but beware — it' is 
very hard to “just browse” at 
this store.

Pugliano shares wisdom
PUGLIANO, from LI
have problems with the mate­
rial, and just give up and leave. 
We deal with it with patience 
and persistence. You’re not go­
ing to deal with these problems 
overnight.” Pugliano’s sheer 
dedication to the prisoners, sim­
ply because they are his stu­
dents, is evident in the confi­
dence he has in them. His belief 
in their abilities and refusal to 
give up on them despite difficul­
ties is a teacher’s pride in his or 
her students: Although the 
teacher knows the student will 
do well in the end, he or she 
knows it won’t happen without 
great time and effort on his or 
her part.
How successful is the pro­
gram? On a collective level, “The 
program ebbs and flows. Our 
peaks were three or four years 
ago. We’re not keeping as many 
students in the prison program
as we want. There’s lack of in­
terest, moving between prisons. 
It will come back.” Pugliano feels 
that although collective achieve- 
ments are important, the 
program’s most significant re­
wards are found on an individual 
level. “I’ve seen dramatic
T can see people right now 
who have accomplished things 
they never would have if it were 
not for this program. One of our 
students got his PhD in educa­
tion while still incarcerated. Af­
ter he got out, another student 
who got his degree in prison 
moved to Indiana and won an 
award for his work with the In­
diana penal system.”
Simply learning the material 
yourself is not enough. Passing 
on the legacy of acquiring knowl­
edge and teaching it to others is 
of supreme significance to 
Pugliano. “One of the special 
things that I will always remem­
ber is what the inmates do for 
their own program. The gradu­
ates keep their own math and 
English workshops for extra help

program. Their willingness to‘i 
give of themselves is very im ­
portant.”
After a couple of semesters 
one of the instructors, Tina Cala- 
bro, quit the program. Calabro 
said, “There was the element of- 
danger. There was the potential 
to be harmed. I guess the safety 
reasons overrode the desire to 
help. I was single and could take 
some chances. I can’t put my life 
in danger. I have responsibili­
ties now.”
Pugliano is not ready to give 
up any of his activities anytime 
soon. “Knowledge is important 
for anyone, anywhere, anytime.”

greatest responsibility of all.”Make time spent abroad what you want it to be

Tartan Staffwriter
I was asked to write this ar­
ticle several weeks ago, but I 
really wasn’t sure what I had to 
say, if anything at all. I knew 
that after being at Centre de 
Tours for only few weeks I 
wouldn’t have anything pro­
found to say about it, or at least 
nothing that many of you haven’t 
already heard from the students 
who returned from last fall. But 
now that I’ve been here two 
months, maybe I can come up 
with something worth reading.
I know that a lot has already 
been said about this program in 
The Tartan and the Student 
Union, by the Office of Interna­
tional Education, and by word of 
mouth, so I’m not trying to con­
vince anyone of the merits or 
faults of this program. I’m just 
going to tell you how things are 
and have been for me since I 
arrived in January. You can fig­
ure out for yourself whether or 
not you want to have anything 
to do with this program.
I got off the plane at Charles 
de Gaulle Airport near Paris 
early in the morning on January
6, not really knowing what to 
expect of France, of the program, 
or even of my ability to speak 
and to comprehend French.
I decided it was best to dive in 
head first, and it was too late to 
turn back. I met up with the 
other four CMU students in the 
new group (the three students 
who stayed in France from last 
semester were already in Tours) 
and we were picked up at the 
airport by the program director. 
The two-and-a-half-hour road 
trip from Paris to Tours was 
interesting, since we were just 
starting to get to know each other 
and comparing horror stories 
about what food each of us had 
been served on the airplane.
Both Helen McRae and 
Katherine Ragot had already 
been in France for a few weeks, 
traveling on their own, so they 
let the rest of us in on the cul­
tural quirks they had already 
picked up on, things like “don’t 
make eye contact with strang­
ers on the street, they’ll think 
you’re propositioning them” and 
“get ready for that Paris Metro, 
man, smells worse than the New 
York subway.”
Soon we arrived at the Carn­
egie Mellon villa in Tours where 
we take classes, cook a fewmeals, 
and just generally hang out when 
the stress of living in a foreign 
' country gets to be too much. The
DESIGN UNLIMITED
PRINSIGN
villa staff greeted us with hot 
chocolate and did its best to make 
us feel at home, but I know we 
were all thinking, “What have I 
gotten myself into, and what the 
hell are they saying? I can’t un­
derstand a word!”
Then we had a tour of the 
facilities, met the two French 
RAs who live in the villa, and sat 
around nervously waiting for 
each of our host families to ar­
rive and take us to our respec­
tive houses.
My host, Madame Geneviève 
de la Rousserie, picked me up 
and drove me to a spacious town 
house, almost in the center of 
town, showed me my room, and 
left me alone to unpack. I think 
that’s when I did the most think­
ing. It was really strange, mov­
ing into someone else’s house in 
a foreign country, not knowing 
what to do or say, and not under­
standing a good portion of what 
was said to me. Then jet lag set 
in and I took a long nap.
I woke up just before dinner 
time — around 8:30 pm — and 
ventured downstairs to meet the 
rest of the family. In addition to 
Monsieur and Madame de la 
Rousserie and five of their six 
children, an English army offi­
cer and French student live in 
the house. This makes for a lot of 
confusion at the dinner table, 
and for the first couple of weeks 
I couldn’t follow too much of the 
conversation.
I guess dinner went fairly well 
that first night, with me scoffing 
up beef bourgiugnon with a 
glazed look on my face, trying to 
follow the conversation but an­
swering with little more than a 
stupid “oui” or “non” every time 
someone asked me a question. 
But the food was really good, 
and the wine was plentiful, so I 
figured maybe everything would
be all right once I could deal 
with the language. I was right. 
After only a few weeks, I’m com­
fortable with my French family, 
and I’m comfortable with 
French, both speaking and un­
derstanding.
I should point out that many 
students came to this program 
with no prior French experience, 
and I think they’re happy that 
. they did it. You can be just as 
successful here without having 
studied French before as any­
one else.
The French appreciate any 
effort you make to speak their 
language, and I haven’t met any­
one who has begrudged any mis­
takes I’ve made. The generali­
zation that the French are rude, 
that they can see you’re an 
American from a mile away, and 
that they’ll speak to you in En­
glish no matter how hard you 
try to get them to speak to you in 
French, is a stereotype and 
prejudice in which I have yet to 
see the faintest trace of truth. 
Maybe a lot of people just mis­
read the levels of familiarities 
and reserve that the French ex­
hibit since they are somewhat 
different than those in America. 
After being here for two months, 
you get used to it, though.
There are still things I’m not 
used to about France. It doesn’t 
have all the convenience of the 
United States, like 24 hour con­
venience stores and restaurants, 
and most places are closed on 
Mondays and for two hours dur­
ing lunch.
But it’s really quite charming, 
especially going to a boulangerie 
each morning to buy a fresh ba­
guette, going to the fresh food 
markets for the day’s meals, 
strolling through the street 
sales, looking at clothes and flow­
ers and everything else they sell.

In some ways, France is as ro­
mantic and charming as cheesey 
romance novels make it sound. 
But it’s a lot like the states, too
— more than I thought it would 
be.
For one thing, most of the pop 
music here comes from the US 
or England. I don’t go to clubs 
too much, just because it’s so 
expensive, but when I do, it 
amazes me every time: I hear 
Nirvana, Michael Jackson, 
Depeche Mode, Madonna, New 
Kids on the Block, Donna Sum­
mer, Elvis, the Beatles, the 
Beach Boys, even the music from 
Grease.
I have yet to hear a French pop 
song in a dance club. But maybe 
that’s because French pop is 
pretty lousy. Anything dance- 
able is imported, and they im­
port all the crap, too. Some of the 
alternative and industrial stuff 
is missing, but otherwise France 
listens to the same thing 
America does, only three months 
late.
Movies are the same. They 
have every American movie 
here, usually dubbed in French 
but occasionally subtitled. Some 
of the hot ones out right now are 
JFK, Frankie and Johnny, and 
Fivel Down Under.
If all else fails, when you need 
that taste of Americana but can’t 
seem to find it, turn on the TV 
and you’re sure to find some 
American shows. Besides Dal­
las and Santa Barbara, there’s 
Cosby, and Who's the Boss, not 
to mention Charlie’s Angels, The 
Incredible Hulk and The Dukes 
of Hazard. France has been in­
vaded by American television.
I actually do take classes here, 
though they’re not really high 
on my list of priorities (since I 
decided that I am not in France 
to learn in the classroom). Right 
now they’re offering about seven 
or eight different classes, of 
which I’m taking four. Most of 
the books are available in the 
villa library, so book expenses 
are minimal, and the professors 
aren’t nearly as demanding as 
they are on the CMU campus. 
The European teaching style 
takes a little getting used to, 
otherwise, classes are okay. The 
computing facilities are another 
story.
Four Macintosh Classics are 
sufficient right now, since there 
are only eight of us here, but if 
they get the turnout they’re ex­
pecting for next semester, they 
will have to upgrade the clustere, 
both in terms of hardware and 
software. Especially email. It 
works, but it’s one hell of a pain 
to send, since all they’ve got is 
one IBM clone on Bitnet. They 
say they’re working on it, though. 
Otherwise, I’ve got no major com­
plaints about the facilities, and 
the staff usually does what they 
can to accommodate us.
My best advice to anyone con­
sidering this program (or any 
other, for that matter) is to look 
into it closely, know what you’re 
getting into, and then come with 
an open mind. If you make the 
best of it, if you take advantage 
of all the opportunities that ex­
ist here and don’t wallow in self- 
pity about what isn’t perfect, 
you will have the time of your
life. Take the program for what 
it is, take France for what is it, 
and make your time here what 
you want it to be. It’s all up to 
you. It’s too easy to sit in the. 
villa all day, chatting with the 
other Americans, cooking din­
ner in the kitchen, watching 
some TV, then going home and 
going to sleep. We all do it here 
sometimes, and we have a good 
time with each other. But I think 
that every one of us here real­
izes that there is so much more' 
than that, that if we don’t go out 
there and make the little time' 
we have here the best that it can 
be, then we might as well not 
have come in the first place.
The easiest way to meet other 
French students is to go to a cafe 
or bar, sit down with a drink, 
and strike up a conversation. Or 
you can just wander over to the 
University and meet people 
there. The trick is to take the 
first step. Most people are really 
receptive to that.
Coming to France is the best 
thing I have ever done because 
I’ve met new people and tried 
new things. I’ve changed as a 
person, my ideals have changed, 
my view of American culture 
has changed a lot, and I think 
I’m a better person for all of it. 
None of this is by virtue of the 
Carnegie Mellon Centre de 
Tours, of course, since I could be 
here through any program. But 
I highly advise anyone with the 
least bit of interest in studying 
abroad to look into a program. 
It’s well worth the effort and it’s 
something you’ll be able to look 
back on for the rest of your life.

Clayton offers view of Victorian excess
5y AARON JENKINS
1artan Asst. Diversions Editor
Clayton, the restored mansion •f Henry Clay Frick, is one of Pittsburgh’s more unique and elaborate sites to visit. Located ¦n Penn Avenue, the estate hares its six acres with he Frick irt Museum, the Playhouse/ Visitor’s Center, the Carriage louse, a greenhouse, and two mall private residences that lave been converted into admin- stration buildings.Henry Clay Frick and his wife, idelaide, purchased the land on yhich Clayton stands in 1881, nd paid a total of $75,000 for he land, the house that stood here, and the provisions for the louse to be refurbished.

worked on the project were from the Pittsburgh area.Upon entering the grounds, I was told to go to the Playhouse. It turns out that the Playhouse was a two story building that Henry Frick built for his chil­dren to play in. It originally consisted of a gymnasium, a darkroom, two bowling lanes, a living room, and a large general room. It has been converted into the Visitor’s Center and Mu­seum Gift Shop since then. The gift shop has the usual histori­cal postcards and books, in ad­dition to some old time arts- and-crafts knick-knacks. The

gift shop is also where you sign up to tour Clayton.Touring Clayton is the same as touring any other historical landmark: you pick up yourpamphlets, pay the fees, and go with the next tour that goes out. When I went, I was the only person in the tour, so I heard more about the history of the Fricks than most people would.You enter Clayton through an enclosed porch, which is ironi­cally the last place mentioned on the tour. The porch is pretty unexciting, except for a big wooden box (about 15 feet high, 10 feet across, and 8 feet deep)
carnival tunes — it actually sounded pretty good.The entry hall of Clayton is stunning. There are red velvet curtains covering the doorways, golden oak wood paneling on the walls, a stained glass window inlay with a (big) jewel, wall covers with inlaid mother-of- pearl, coffered ceilings, linen wall panels that look like pressed leather, parquet floors covered with red linen carpeting, and a big clock with incredibly intri­cate carvings to round out your first impressions of the room. There’s no way to describe the splendor of this first room; if it
sounds interesting, go see it.The parlor is next on the tour. Everything from the wall cover­ing to the furniture and carpet is red velvet (Adelaide Frick’s fa­vorite color). There is a beauti­ful wood grain piano in one cor­ner, a ceramic clock and match­ing candle holders from Tiffany’s, and a gilded wood ceil­ing. All of the furniture is on castors, so that an open space could be created in the room for what our guide called “audience participation events,” such as dances or music recitals.Next came the dining room. The architect who designed it wanted it to resemble a medi­eval castle, and it looked like he got what he wanted. All the wood is mahogany (includingthe table and 19 green velvet cushioned chairs). All of the hardware, in­cluding the grills over the win­dows and the handles on the cupboards, is silver. Fine china and crystal fill the sideboards, and the chandelier over the table was electrified by Westinghouse himself.The rest of the tour includes about ten more rooms, all of which have the richness and color described so far.In almost every room of Clayton there are incredible art­works, ranging from paintings to vases to silver hairbrushes with inlaid emeralds and sev­eral other kinds of excess. It was boggling to try to keep track of all the painters and sculptors;
there are literally dozens of them.Clayton is the only building that has an admission charge; you are free to wander the rest of the grounds in peace. The green­house is a miniaturized copy of Phipps Conservatory and is open to visitors most of the time. The carriage house contains five car­riages, one sleigh, and one auto­mobile, each one labeled with its use, its age, and so on. There are also signs on the wall that out­line transportation and travel over the years at Clayton.The Frick Art Museum is set off from the other buildings by a fence, so it was last on my explo: ration. The rotunda is without doubt the most interesting fea­ture there; the rest was over­shadowed by my recent tour of Clayton. The art museum houses Helen Frick’s personal art col­lection, and there are exhibi­tions as well as private collec­tions. Exhibitions come to the museum about once a month, and tours are available for them. Also, the museum is known for its concert series.It is an enjoyable hour or so spent touring Clayton and the grounds. If you have any inter­est in the history of Henry Clay Frick, or of Clayton itself, you have to see it for yourself.You’ll also get a taste of art, architecture, music, and a good idea about how the Pittsburgh rich lived in the early part of the 20th century.

The nicest thing to do on a •ainy afternoon is walk through i garden. Phipps Conservatory, ocated in Schenley Park right jehind Flagstaff Hill, is the inly place I enow of vhere you :an do this vithout get- -ing wet. bounded in .892, the ¡onserva- ory is Pitts- >urgh’s best iscape for myone who vants to ixperience something lifferent.Upon en- ering the nain room,•he Palm Dourt, the irst thing First sobrmnns.Sn

Al- eady, it is not hard to see why le conservatory became an his- pric landmark within the first ear of its existence.The Palm Court contains lants from all over the world, lduding Mexico, Upper Guinea, ladagascar, the Solomon Is- inds, India, Japan, West Af- ica, Brazil, and China.

Room houses a big surprise and proves that chocolate does grow on trees. The rather large seeds have a bitter almond-like taste (don’t ask how I know) and look like gourds. Also in the Fern Room is the world’s largest Chia pet. This one, which remotely resembles an anteater, stands about four and a half feet tall and five feet long.The Parterre de Broderie room, is, by far, the' prettiest room. It has a brick floor and the flowers and plants are ar­ranged symmetrically in ovals and circles. Not a thing is out of line.The Victoria Room is a big marshland, complete with a large “pool” of murky water that covers a large part of some of the plants growing there. In­side this pool, however, are two more Chia pets, only this time they were 10-foot feathered friends covered with ivy.Last but not least is the Desert Room, which is clearly the warmest room. The room is filled with all sorts of succulent plants, most of them cacti.But all of this was only on the
inside of the Conservatory.The Desert Room extends to an outdoor Japanese Courtyard Garden, complete with a little waterfall, which houses several bonsai trees. Bonsai — the art of cultivating and shaping dwarfed trees in ceramic con­tainers — is that obscure art that underwent resur­gence a few years ago when Pat Morita demon­strated his exper­tise in The Karate 
Kid.Also part of the conservatory is the Outdoor Gar­den. You’ll be greeted by a statue of Christo­pher Columbus before you walk up the black- topped path to the main gates. The Outdoor Garden is free of charge and opens in mid- March, when the flower show begins. Open from 9 am to dusk, it is the perfect setting for a romantic interlude when the sun’s reds and oranges fall on the greens of the tree- tops.This year’s show theme is “Plantasia,” as each exhibition room hosts a different mystical composition. One room even re­minded me of Alice in Wonder­
land with its 5-foot tall water­ing can. It might even have a little sign on it saying “drink me,” which I would have been tempted to do, feeling so small. “Plantasia” will be held at the Conservatory from March 21 through April 19, 9 am to 9 pm daily.Before you leave the magical gardens and enter reality again, be sure to find the bench on your way out that has inscribed in its seat:“Thank God for a garden Be it ever so small Thank God for the sunshine That comes flooding it all.” Phipps Conservatory is indeed a godsend, allowing all who en­ter a chance to escape from the everyday.
Sublime found in new space
By DANIEL FREY
Tartan Art Editor
Amidst the Pitt student apart­ments and the cluttered resi­dences to be found in the com­munity of Oakland there exists, in stark contrast to the neigh­borhood, a small and fairly unique art gallery. This gal­lery, noticeable by its large store­front windows, is an alternative art space organized by Carnegie Mellon students Carolla Zap (Sophomore, CFA) and Andi Rieber (Sopho­more, CFA). The space, one medium sized room and a cramped entrance area, is funded by a five hundred dollar SURG grant. The students use the upstairs of the house as their apartment, have a studio space for themselves, and offer a place for several local hands to practice. What is visible to the neigh­borhood is the chang­ing shows that are pre­sented in the art space.Presently showing in the alternative art space is an installation piece by German artist Bertrand Freiesleben, whom Zap and Reiber met in a New York cafe. His art was being shown in the city at the time. The work, en­titled “the sublime is inside,” is placed within the crampedfront entrance of the gallery, while the larger exhibition space is sealed off almost completely. The work is highly visible to any Oakland passersby and people are able to look through either the large display windows or enter the small space if they feel comfortable — even though there is virtually no room to walk around.Although the space is small, Freiesleben has managed to fill it with a large collection of ob­jects. The objects, although unconnected at first when taken as a whole, relay a complex nar­rative of images and metaphors. In the space there are items such as a briefcase that con­tains a Rubik’s Cube, two keys
that have been joined together, and a Bible. Hovering above this is a scale that is measuring sand and rose petals, and a fish­ing rod whose line is cast into the unknown. The Unknown is the room that has been sealed shut, partitioned with a wall that has scrawled on it in a polite graffitti “the sublime is inside”. Mounted on this partition is an empty hour glass, seven roses, and seven wax seals. Rose pet-
science and religion both search for an answer to the unknown. It is that search that the “sub­lime is inside” is all about. The piece is neither hopeful nor pes­simistic and tries to be objective about the struggles in the search for knowledge and understand­ing.The phrase “the sublime is in­side” echoes throughout the piece. Is “the sublime” in the room that is sealed off and hid-

als are spread across the floor, but the environment is controlled by the strands of barbed wire that cross through the space. The barbed wire, although threaten­ing, is plated in brass. Its golden shine denies its danger. The ele­ments in the room are not only beautiful (the colours of the roses and the golden barbed wire are extremely elegant) but they are also very challenging.In describing his work, the art­ist almost speaks of it as one would describe a narrative; each item has a significant meaning and is a metaphor for a concept or an idea. Infused in each is the artist’s understanding of the world and of mankind. The closed room seems to hide something, and almost every object is a mo­ment in our quest to find it —
den from our view? Is it the art piece itself with the viewer standing outside looking in? Or is it elsewhere — unknown? At the very core of this work is a playful mystery.Situated where it is, in the middle of an urban neighbor­hood, the audience the work re­ceives is broad — oftentimes skeptical—but forces itself upon people who may not usually get the opportunity to see much new and creative art. The alterna­tive art space found on Atwood Street is a wonderful chance for students to see work being cre­ated outside of the univerisity environment.The show “the sublime is hv- side” will be up for another two weeks. The display is a powerful work and well worth seeing.

Alcohol policymakers possess characteristics of mutants
I was such a devoted and seri­ous college student that I have credits from 37 schools, so I thinkI. know what I’m talking about when I say that this “no drink­ing on campus” stuff is just a 
little bit out of line, v One time, at the University of Arkansas, I was part of the '¡Gang of Seven” who drank 94 <;ases of Coors in one week with­out ever leaving the dorm room. Think aboutit. Besides the sheer stamina this took, we had to 
smell each other.' Another time, at Ole Miss, I was the runner-up in the an­nual Swill-and-Spill Kamikaze Mud Slide, where you skid your Jtott down a cattle chute while trying to pour, carry, and drink 
Si Tequila shooter, chased with an Old Milwaukee Tall Boy. I didn’t spill a drop. I would have won, but I temporarily lost my bearings and drank the tall Boy first and chased it with the Te­quila.I went to Cal State Chico one time and showed the student body how to mix more healthful drinks, like Jack Daniels and Diet Dr. Pepper. That’ll keep the body fat down, save room for i;he keg later.‘ So two things I really know &bout are a) college, and b) get­ting polluted in college, and so what I’d like to say first is we should remember to drink only in moderation. I was talking to my friend Hunter Thompson about this last week, and he re­minded me that crack cocaine clauses no permanent brain dam­
age, but you have to know when to say when. So I wanna be straight about that first of all. We’re talking social drinking here.- Next, let’s get down to the real nitty-gritty about why they have all these new federal laws tell-

ing colleges that, if they allow liquor on campus, they get all their money cut off.Listen up, Bozos: All those guys and gals in college are vot­
ing age. Why don’t you ask them to vote on it?Nobody would pass a law say­ing black people can’t do some­thing if they can’t even vote on whether or not they get to do it. Nobody would pass a law say­ing people over the age of 65 can’t drink, even though it’s probably more damaging to them than it is to people aged18 to 21. But this particular group of people gets trampled on more than any other single minority group we’ve got.So what’s really going on here? Why would we have a gerbil-brained law like this that restricts personal freedom and treats voters like pond scum?Because the lawmakers are 
old, and they just flat don’t like teenagers. They don’t like their hormones. They don’t like their wildness. They don’t like their lack of control. It’s almost as if our mothers ran the Congress these days. Mothers have al­
ways wanted to totally elimi­nate alcohol from campuses. But who always stepped in and re­stored freedom?Fathers.Aren’t any of these Congress­men fathers? Are they all trans­
vestites? Didn’t anybody read Hemingway or get drunk with his old man? When these people were 18, did they really believe that they were too stupid to make decisions about alcohol? I doubt it—because now they’re 62, and they don’trealize they’re too stu­pid to make decisions about re­
stricting alcohol.Give these people their liquor back. It’s their decision, not yours.Speaking of grotesquely de­formed mutants with too much power, “Basket Case III” is fi­nally here, and after ten years, the world’s most famous gnarly- squashed-octopus-Siamese- twin-in-a-basket can still chew neck with the best of them. As far as I know, Frank Henen- lotter, the writer and director of this series, is the only man mak­ing serious handicapped rights films today, but does he get any credit? In fact, Frank may be the only filmmaker who makes ev­ery single character retarded in one way or another, so that fi­nally you can’t tell the loonies from the bin.As everyone knows from the last movie, Duane went crazy after his girlfriend died, so he took a baseball bat to his mu­tant brother andsewedhim back 
on his body. Part Three begins with Duane in a strait-jacket, Belial refusing to come out of his basket, and all the other mem­bers of America’s most popular mutant family boarding a school bus to go down South and visit “Little Hal,” a 3,000 pound six­armed Jello mold with acne.I’m not kidding. You’ve gotta see this. But that’s not even the grossest thing in the movie. The grossest thing in the movie is the delivery of Belial’s 12 chil­dren, who come out of Eve (Mrs. Belial) on a 30-foot rope that

“A Consumer’s Republic: The Politics of Consumption in Postwar America’?
4 p.m.Tuesday, March 17 Adamson Wing, Baker Hall
Since World War II, Americans have defined their rights as citizens in terms of their equal access to the fruits of our postwar consumer society. African Americans, for example, not only defined “equality” in terms of political and labor force participation, but also as their economic right to consume in a free market. Dr. Cohen will discuss how consumption relations have shaped struggles over class, race and gender during the post-World War II era.
Lizabeth Cohen has been a professor of history at Carnegie Mellon since 1986 and author of the critically acclaimed book “Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919-1939.” She holds a doctorate in American history from the University of California, Berkeley, and is working on a book about postwar consumer society.

“This place has good ambi­ence.”! That was my first thought upon entering that place which all college students wish to visit at least once during their four (or five, or six, or seven, or... you get the picture) years at college. ¡The place of which I speak is a (restaurant. And not just any old Restaurant — a cheap restau­rant. A cheap restaurant that serves good food, i “A cheap restaurant that has good food!” you scream in disbe­lief. “I thought those two states were mutually exclusive!”| Well, take heart. They are not. gut what you may ask is the hame of this restaurant. It’s the Spaghetti Warehouse down in ¡Pittsburgh’s Strip District.

had for less than ten dollars.“Well, I can get that at Mickey D’s,” you might say.Oh, but Mickey D’s does not have the ambience and the charm of the Spaghetti Ware­house. I sat in a section of the restaurant that everyone should ask to be seated. The trolley car.
The trolley car? Yes, the trolley car. Let me explain.The Spaghetti Warehouse of­fers its customers a blast from the past. While enjoying your delicious, non-CMDS dinner, you can look around an<J find old advertisements for products no longer in existence, and for those we still use today. Take, for in-
stance, Coca-Cola. There’s an ad from when Coke really was the “real thing.” Not to mention the ads for Mellow Yellow and Squirt. Oh, the nostalgia.Well, it might have nice ambi­ence and the food might be good, but what exactly do they serve? Does the Spaghetti Warehouse serve spaghetti, or is that just a name used to mislead and con­fuse the general public?To answer these questions, I must confess that they do in­deed serve spaghetti, but they serve a variety of other Italian foods as well, including veal and
I cannot tell you about the lasagna, but I have heard from a reliable source that the veal is quite tasty; and I can tell you from my own experience that the spaghetti is definitely some­thing to write home about.There is one tiny drawback that I feel obligated to mention; Spaghetti Warehouse is located in the Strip District. It may be a little difficult to get there if you don’t have a car, so you need to know someone who does, or be good at hot-wiring. But if you fit into one of the three aforemen­tioned categories, or are an ad­venturesome soul who doesn’t mind taking public transporta­tion (well, I suppose you could take a cab), I suggest you check this place out whenever you get the chance. Your digestive sys­tem will be forever grateful and so will your wallet.

AH those who love to be number one say 'eye’
" The eighties were the decade of the Peacock. NBC dominated t&e ratings for years with hits like Cosby, The Golden Girls, 
Family Ties, and Night Court. Plus it received critical acclaim fgr sticking by lower-rated qual­ify programs like St. Elsewhere and Hill Street Blues. Its Thurs­day night lineup was unbeat­able, and the Top 10 was regu­larly filled with NBC shows. For the most part, the other net­works could only sit back in amazement and admit defeat.; But now it’s the nineties, and television has a new look. This season CBS has vaulted from tlrird to first place, while NBC will be lucky to finish in a weak second. ABC, as usual, is hang­ing in, and Fox, perennially the fourth network, is constantly growing.:In a season or two, NBC’s eighties domination will be long forgotten. In three or four years, Fox may be challenging one of the Big Three. Network televi­sion is in the middle of some big changes, largely the result of smart programming and good shows (and, at the other end of the spectrum, dumb program­ming and bad shows).The decisions the networks are making today will have a direct effect on their future happiness. What follows is a network-by- network analysis of the state of prime time television.: CBS is clearly the network to beat in 1992. This former hope­less basement dweller has climbed to the top with a combi­nation of special events (includ-
THE LAUGH TRACK

ing the World Series, Super­bowl, and Winter Olympics) and great shows.Monday night is the center­piece of CBS’s schedule. It boasts a very successful sitcom lineup that took years to build. Murphy 
Brown didn’t crack the Top 10 until its third season; Designing 
Women was an on-again, off- again performer for several years; and Evening Shade took a full season to catch on.This new-found success is due in part to the patience CBS has shown with quality programs. This same patience put NBC on the top in the eighties (remem­ber Cheers and Family Ties?). Right now, CBS is sticking by its Wednesday lineup of Davis 
Rules and Brooklyn Bridge, even though it hasn’t turned in im­pressive showings.The rest of the CBS schedule is a good mixture of news, drama, and reality counter-program­ming. On Friday and Saturday, however, CBS looks like a differ­ent network. A string of real losers has appeared on these two nights, with the most recent crop (including Scorch, Tequila and 
Bonetti, and Fish Police) quite stinky.
Scotch ‘1ST Soda unveils 
Carnival production, 2Stud
By MARY YEE
Tartan staffwriter
Scotch ‘N’ Soda’s largest un- dertakinginmanyyears, Jack!, will be presented during carni­val this year. The musical ex­plores society's enigmatic ob­session with violent crimes.There is a cast of 25, an or­chestra band of 11, and a pro­duction staff of about 40-50 people. There will be much ad­vertising for the production that is sure to pay off.
Jack! offers audiences new challenges. On the surface, 
Jack! looks like a mystery but upon deeper scrutiny, one will find that it is also a drama, comedy, and tragedy.The basic story of Jack! deals with a series of prostitute mur­ders that are very similar to the Jack the Ripper killings. There is a race against time throughout the production, as the police search frantically to find the murderer before any more gruesome crimes can be committed. Creator of Jack!, CMU psychology alumnus Jim Lane explained how he came up with the concept for the show.“I got the idea for the play
during a lunch with a friend to create a play about Jack the Ripper. I did a lot of research and found out that there were many plays about him. I sub­mitted my play to Scotch ‘N’ Soda and through the selection process, mine was chosen,” said Lane.It is the fascinating killer Jackthe Ripper that drew Lane to the idea.“Jackthe Ripper was not just your ordinary killer. He at­tracted massive media atten­tion from the press. Jack be­came a celebrity overnight. Think about the news today. What stories make top head­lines: crimes. It’s what the people want to know,” explained Lane. “I set the play in the present context to create a wider appeal to audiences to­day, so that they can relate to the plot. I also wanted to create a ‘dark’ mood about society’s fear, yet fascination with crime.”
Jack! will be performed start­ing April 9 during Carnival. With all of the interest society has in violence and crime, the show is bound to be a success. I know that I‘ll be there. Don’t miss it.
OUTLOOK: If it makes the right moves, CBS could stay on top for some time to come. Look for the Eye net to try to domi­nate another night by breaking up its Monday schedule. Last week Murphy Brown and De­
signing Women had special Wednesday night episodes. If the ratings for this experiment are good, Murphy could move to Wednesday, with Women taking Murphy's old Monday slot.It’s always risky to move a hit, but a successful switch would greatly strengthen CBS. 
Murphy Brown’s huge follow­ing will increase the ratings of the shows that precede and fol­low it. This move could give 
Brooklyn Bridge the boost it needs, as well as opening up two slots (Monday and Wednes­day at 9:30) where new hits can be bred.Also, CBS has picked up the NBC drama In the Heat of the 
Night for next season. This seems a perfect fit for CBS’s struggling Friday night sched­ule. Its older audience matches up well against ABC’s younger- skewing sitcoms. Possibly com­bined with Matlock, another drama cancelled by NBC, Heat could provide CBS with at least a strong second place showing on that night.ABC doesn’t have enough strength to be in first place, but it could carve out a good second place niche. Moving Full House from Friday to Tuesday this season proved to be a smart decision: ABC’s Tuesday lineup is currently the strongest in television.Unfortunately, other nights are not doing quite as well. Without Full House, the Fri­day schedule has seen its rat­ings slip. Dinosaurs didn’t turn out to be the powerhouse ev­eryone expected it to be on Wednesday, and the attempt to create a Saturday sitcom block has failed miserably (ABC con­sistently finishes fourth on that night). Finally, ABC has yet to find a successful drama, al­though it seems to be sticking by Civil Wars and Homefront.Given time, this schedule could grow stronger, but ABC is in danger of shooting itself in the foot with bone-headed pro­gramming decisions. Last week, Doogie Howser, the only consistent time period winner for ABC on Wednesday night, was moved to a lower-visibility time, 8:30, in order to make way for The Young Indiana 
Jones Chronicles. If Jones flops (and it sure looks like it will), 
ABC will have lost any momen- • turn it had on Wednesday.OUTLOOK: Anything but silly sitcoms would be a sur­prise. Still, by spreading out its strength, ABC can fix up some problem nights.
Dinosaurs, a pretty good show with a pretty small audience, will probably turnup on Friday or Saturday before the end of the season. In the fall, look for

Growing Pains, and Perfect 
Strangers should be leaving the air, as they are currently turn­ing in abysmal ratings on Satur­day.NBC is in big, big trouble. The Peacock network has been riding the coattails of its eighties hits for several years, but those days will soon be over. The Cosby 
Show, Night Court, and The 
Golden Girls all leave the air after this season (although some of the Girls will be back in a new series). Cheers will be around for at least one more year, but prob­ably not much longer.Things wouldn’t be so bad if NBC had any new shows strong enough to replace these hits. Unfortunately, with the excep­tion of The Fresh Prince of Bel- 
Air and Seinfeld, NBC’s sitcoms • are either old or incredibly me­diocre. Wings would die without 
Cheers as a lead-in, and Saturday’s Empty Nest-Nurses
lineup is downright embarrass­ing.To make things worse, NBC has hurt itself by canceling 
Matlock and losing In the Heat 
of the Night to CBS. Its once- strongTuesday lineup will soon only have one hit remaining: 
Law & Order.OUTLOOK: Bleak. A Differ­
ent World will probably take over Cosby’s slot, but The 
Sijnpsons provides more chal­lenging competition than JBa6es andDrexell’s Class. Wednesday and Thursday are the only nights NBC will have a chance to win this fall, and even those victories are iffy.NBC will essentially be start­ing from scratch, with lots of premieres and very few return­ing hits. For the next few sea­sons, it looks as though the pea­cock will be grounded — in the ratings cellar.Fox just keeps on getting stronger. Moving The Simpsons to Thursday was a risky change that has really paid off. Homer and family even beat an origi­nal Cosby Show for the first time two weeks ago. When
Cosby exits this fall, Fox has a; real chance to dominate the tim& period.
On Sunday, Married...with.. 
Children continues to turn in winning performances, as does< 
In Living Color. The rest of this young network’s shows aren't- hits in the classic sense, but theii- demographics are appealing tg advertisers. Beverly Hills 902lQ^ 
Parker Lewis Can’t Lose, Ro$ and even Herman’s Head con­sistently deliver the young view^ ers Fox strives for. And reality programs on Friday and Satur­day are popular and cheap to produce.OUTLOOK: Pretty rosy. In tl)e next few months, Fox plans to expand to a five-night schedule, (and eventually to all seveiE nights). New projects included 
90210 spinoff that has “hit” writ^ ten all over it.If Fox can finally find a good - companion for The Simpsons on: Thursday nights and continue : to premiere programs that chal-; lenge the status quo of the Big Three, this fourth network migh't’ not be in fourth for too much longer.

Thursday, March 12Breathless
Jean-Luc Godard’s 1959 film (written by Francois 
Truffaut) celebrates the American idea of the ro­
manticized gangster-hero in a French setting.
In this Bonnie and Clyde-esque film, Jean-Paul 
Belmondo is cast as a young French hood who 
models himself on the films of James Cagney and 
Humphrey Bogart. Into his life comes a beautiful 
American student, Jeanne Seberg, and, after 
Belmondo makes the mistake of stealing a car and 
shooting a cop, they get into trouble with the law. 
The film chronicles their run from the police through 
Paris and the French countryside.
This film, called “groundbreaking and influen­
tial,” is truly a masterpiece from Godard’s ouevre. 
Fans of Richard Gere may remember that he ap­
peared in a 1983 remake of this picture, and are 
urged to seek out the original Breathless, if only to 
see the original intent behind the film, as envi­
sioned by Godard and Truffaut, two of the masters 
of film.

Friday, March 13Goldfinger
Sean Connery is back in the greatest James Bond 
movie ever, Goldfinger. Bond is out to stop 
Goldfinger, the killer with the Midas touch, who’s 
out to rip off Fort Knox and destroy the free world 
while he’s at it. Sound good so far?
It gets better. All of the players are in this film; Q, 
M, Miss Moneypenny, Felix Leiter, and of course, 
Pussy Galore (guess who gets her?). Goldfinger is 
the ultimate bad guy, and Oddjob with his bowler 
hat is the ultimate bad guy’s side kick. Also, watch 
for Bond’s beautiful Aston Martin, loaded with all 
the gadgets you could ever want.
If you’ve only see George Lazenby or Roger Moore 
as James Bond, you’re in for a real treat. This is 
quite possibly Connery’s finest performance ever. 
The action is intense, from the pre-credit sequence 
to the final battle. This film is the best. Go see it, no 
matter what.

Saturday, March 14The Last Boy Scout
The Last Boy Scout is basically Lethal Weapon on 
steroids. Gunshots, explosions, death, and destruc­
tion are the prominent themes throughout the film, 
and it was even written by Shane Black, the writer 
of Lethal Weapon. And yeah — it is awesome!
Bruce Willis plays a down-and-out detective who 
teams up with an ex-NFL quarterback (Damon 
Wayans) in order to bring down a criminal organi­
zation that wants to legalize sports gambling. Luck­
ily, the plot is not the point of the movie; the action 
is. And the action does not fail to deliver.
You’ll love it. Go see it.
At 6, 8,10, midnight
Sunday, March 15The Morning After
An alcoholic ex-movie star, played by Jane Fonda, 
wakes up with a rather bloody, very dead man and 
no recollection of what happened the night before. 
Talk about a hangover. The Morning After is the 
suspenseful tale of Fonda’s attempt to escape the 
cops — and figure out who killed her one-riight 
stand. Did she do it? Was it the cat? Was there a 
motive? Is she next?
As Fonda battles these questions along with her 
alcoholism, The Morning After offers a harsh lesson 
on the evils of drinking and random sex. Jeff Bridges 
turns in a strong performance as an ex-cop who 
attempts to help her out.
In the tradition of films like Jagged Edge, this 
thriller will have you on the edge of your seat — and 
occasionally jumping off of it. Don’t forget to hide 
those butcher knives the next time you have a drink. 
And don’t forget to see The Morning After, ‘cause it’s 
well worth the dollar.

La Mancha comes alive in Pittsburgh
by MARY YEE
Tartan Staffwriter
The original production of Man 
of La Mancha opened at the ANTA Theatre in Washington Square in November, 1965, win­ning 5 Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Score, Best Director, and Best Scenic De­sign, as well as the New York Drama Critics’ Award for Best Musical. The play also intro­duced the song “The Impossible Dream,” which set the standards for future musicals. Man of La 
Mancha is the 12th longest run­ning show in Broadway history, with 2341 performances.Based on the life and works of Miguel de Cervantes, Man of La 
Mancha is a musical play about Cervantes’ greatest character, Don Quixote, who strives to at­tain the “impossible dream” while imprisoned in a Spanish Inquisition dungeon. While trapped in the dungeon, Cer­vantes tells his story of Don Quixote to the prisoners. His “impossible dream” is the age- old struggle of the conflict be­tween realism and idealism.Raul Julia, as Don Quixote, is fantastic. As a man who imag­ines himself a chivalous knight,
Quixote is larger than life. One cannot help falling in love with a man who sees everything as good and magical. For example, in a scene where Quixote and Sancho are confronted by gypsy thieves, Quixote insists that the thieves are really a tribe of charming people. Sancho tries to change his master’s mind, but it does not work, and they are robbed by the gypsies.Sheena Easton was wonder­ful as Aldonza. Not only does she sing well, her performance as the wild, rebellious prosti­tute earns her respect from the audience in her portrayal. As the play progresses, we watch as Aldonza reveals her sympa­thy, generosity, and caring loy­alty to the one man, Don Quixote, who makes her feel like a lady.Sancho, played by Tony Martinez, is splendid. Since first cast as Sancho in 1967, he has played the role in every major revival of the show, and recently celebrated his two thousandth performance as Quixote’s side­kick.There is no doubt that the magic of Man of La Mancha lies in its creation of a play within a play. The prisoners are cast as characters in the story of Don

Quixote, which Cervantes is tell­ing them. “There is a change from reality to imagination to convince these prisoners that fantasy can become reality,” Martinez comments.With its powerful message of
the conflict between idealism and realism and a couple of his­torical tidbits, Man of La 
Mancha is a play that you will 
always remember. It uplifts your spirits and'reminds you of the hope that keeps us all alive.Naked Lunch serves up bizarre storyline
By WASEEM HUSSAIN
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Director David Cronenberg’s latest concoction, Naked, Lunch, is a thought-provoking piece of work that has very little enter­tainment value. On a literal level, the story goes something like this: a repressed extermi­nator/writer, Bill Lee, played by 
Robocop Peter Weller, runs out of bug spray on a routine assign­ment for the bug agency. Why? Because he and his sultry wife have been secretly freebasing the stuff for that unimaginable high only insect killer can give!Thus the seed for one of the predominant themes in the film begins to surface, that of depen­dency and addiction. Lee is taken in by the cops for questioning, and that is where his life begins to get exponentially bizarre. At the station, Lee is left alone with a talking bug who draws Lee into the intricate world of Interzone, where he is told that his wife is a double agent and must be killed at once.Lee complies (kind of), and before he knows it, he has fled America and gone to Interzone, that despicable den of scum and villainy! A metaphor for steamy Algiers, Interzone becomes the setting for the rest of the film.From this point on, the plot loses all linearity. There’s some­thing about a maniacal con­spiracy and Interzone agent games. But more importantly, it

is from the trip to Interzone that our austere hero makes new friends. They come in all shapes, sizes, genders, and species, and are quite a colorful bunch.There are several ways to judge this film. The standard Hollywood glitz scale is one way. On that scale Naked Lunch would probably rate a resound­ing zero. So if you’re in the mood for a Happy Meal and that in­valuable “feel good” warmth, stay away. Stay far away. Or you could make a massive intel­lectual leap and try to see how well the film Naked Lunch com­pares to the controversial Wil­liam S. Burroughs novel by the same name. Or you could simply take this “artsy” flick at face value and judge it on those terms.So what’s the point of Naked 
Lunch: The Movie? There are a lot of different answers to this question. Cronenberg seems to focus on the dilemma of the writer as artist. Where will the magic words come from?Lee can only seem to attain that blissfiil unity with his work, with his innermost self, through his savage addictions. Only when he is in a hallucinatory
state does he seem to produce his best work.It’s a difficult message to sal­vage from the film because of the point of view of the story. It is told in a detached first person. Because the viewer is seeing the story through Lee’s eyes, the audience is just as disoriented about the reality of Lee’s life as he is. For Lee, any works that he produces are nonsensical logis­tical reports on the secret activi­ties of the conspirators in Interzone.It is only in one of the few. flashes of reality that we realize with Lee that he has been writ­ing a magnificent book called 
Naked Lunch all along. When friends show him pages from the manuscript, Lee confidently de­nies that he has ever seen or heard of the stuff, let alone writ­ten it. Only by breaking the con­strictive walls of ego can the artist access the hidden truths that go into creating a master­piece.The insect killer drug is cer­tainly one way in which one can attain this sense of unity, and thus the entire notion of drug use as a way to unification is a major theme in the film. But the other vehicle for unity, and the other major theme in the film, is sex.The act of writing is like sex, and so the typewriters that all the various writers in Interzone own literally come to represent their own sexuality. These gro­tesque machines come in all
shapes and genders, with unique, abrasive voices of their own.The typewriters are part of the outrageous metaphorical fireworks display that is the movie. Sex is a necessary emo­tional vehicle in Lee’s search for unity.
Naked Lunch may be a film about control, repression, and sacrifice. Or something com­pletely different. That’s part of the fun of Naked Lunch and other films like this. They are- brain teasers, canvasses that force you to paint your own pic­tures.Cronenberg, in an interview published in Rolling Stone a few weeks ago, says, “An entertainer gives you those good old songs that you want to hear. An artist wants to give you what you don’t know you want. Something you might know you want the next time, but you never knew you wanted before.”In other words, Cronenberg’s version of Naked Lunch is a tir­ing exercise in expanding your mind. Tiring is the key word.It is a film laden with food for thought, but difficult to chew, let alone digest. It is easy to gape at the impressive fireworks, or simply snooze at visually flat one-on-one dialogues, or easier still not to go at all.With all its unusual re- presentaions, Naked Lunch is the kind of film that you have to invest in if you’re going to get anything out of it.
Lords of Acid
Lust
kkkk
Hard-pounding, bass-driven techno, the' current staple of European dance music, is prolif­erating in the US, with new re­leases by popular acid house bands Lords of Acid and Quadrophonia.The Lords break the sound barrier with their album, Lust, on Caroline Records. Of the twelve tracks on the CD, only one, “Mixed Emotions,” is not a winner, but it comes close. The best tracks are the undeniably funny “I Must Increase My Bust,” the life story of a woman obsessed with the size of her breasts, and “Spacy Bitch,” a tune that opens with the haunt­ing sounds of a operatic female voice, which is quickly inter­rupted by an irate man, who screams at the “spacy bitch” of
the title to get “down on the floor.”Other winners, and there are plenty, include the hilariously sexual “I Sit on Acid,” the remix of which contains what may be the most interesting orgasm ever recorded for a dance track.The only reason I can see that would make you want to avoid this album is the intense,
