After a series of interviews over 
the summer, the presidential 
search committees have narrowed 
the choice to a “short list” of can­
didates.
The co-chairs of the student 
committee, junior Kishore Rao 
and senior Carlos Franco, report 
that students have hadmore than 
token participation in this por­
tion of the search, but refuse to
release the names of students who 
were involved in interviews.
The search for Carnegie Mel- 
lon’s seventh president is being 
conducted by three committees 
— a trustee committee, a faculty 
committee, and a student com­
mittee. A steering committee, 
which coordinatesthe search, was 
scheduled to meet yesterday at 
the College Club to map out a 
plan now that a “short list” of 
candidates has been agreed upon.

The first round consisted of visits nary discussions” rather than

trustees to potential candidates. No students participated in
these meetings. On June 19, the 
committees agreed on a “medium 
list” of candidates.
Over the last two months day­
long interviews were conducted 
with the candidates on this list. 
Trustees, faculty, and one or two 
students attended each of these 
interviews.

Tartan Contributing Editor
The estimated completion date of the new 304-bed east 
campus dormitory has been delayed until the beginning of 
next summer.
The dormitory had originally been scheduled for occu­
pancy this semester. In February the University announced 
that the dorm had been delayed and would not be included 
in the room draw for this academic year. At that time 
members of the administration said that they planned to 
finish one of the two wings and hold a mini room draw this 
semester for students who wished to move from other Uni­
versity-owned housing into the new dorm. According to 
Housing Director Anthony Martin, those plans have now 
been set aside.
The two wings of the dorm have been brought back to the 
same schedule so that they will be finished at the same 
time. Martin speculated that the move was made because

Walter resigns; Murphy takes helm at Student Affairs
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan News Editor
Former Ombudsman Michael 
C. Murphy has replaced Braden 
L. Walter as dean of Student Af­
fairs. Walter’s resignation and 
Murphy’s appointment were ef­
fective on June 1. Walter had 
spent eight years as dean.
“For me,” said Murphy, “this is 
where I want to be. This is the 
work that I want to do. It’s been 
great.”

special projects coordinator, was 
named associate dean of Student 
Affairs and acting dean. Murphy

goes over 
well despite 
poor retreat
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Students, counselors, and adminis­
trators agree that freshman orienta­
tion was a success as a whole this 
year, but seem dissatisfied with the 
retreat portion of the orientation.
Acting dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy said he was con­
cerned about the differences created 
by the “have’s and have not’s” that 
previously existed when part of the 
class went to camp and the other did 
not, so this year’s orientation differed 
from those of previous years in that 
the entire class went to camp.
On-campus orientation was more 
intensive than last year, relying not 
on experts but instead capitalizing on 
the strength of the counselors to cre­
ate a “student-to-student” atmos­
phere. On-campus orientation also 
tried to do more things with freshman 
parents.
Retreat, in turn, was far less struc­
tured; in general, freshmen were free 
to swim, boat, hike, or just enjoy get-
coordinator. Anne Witchner, for­
merly director of student activi­
ties, was named assistant dean of 
Student Affairs.
“It’s an acting appointment for 
a year,” said Murphy, “and there 
will need to be a determination by 
[Vice President for Enrollment] 
Bill Elliott [for a full-time ap­
pointment]. However, the inten­
tion is clear that this will be an 
acting appointment.”
Elliott told The Tartan that 
there has been some “deliberate 
talk” regarding a permanent ap­
pointment but that the decision 
required the department “give 
some time.”
“We had a freshman orienta-
tion to take care of, and obviously 
we wanted to get the semester off 
to a good start. The last thing 
anybody wanted to do was to 
divert time to a search [for a per­
manent dean].”
As to whether the permanent 
dean would be Murphy, Elliott 
refused to speculate. “It would be 
premature to judge.”
Murphy wouldn’t speculate 
about the future of the office of 
ombudsman either. “It would be 
unwise to try to define the om­
budsman position anew while 
we’re in essence defining Student 
Affairs anew. We will get the 
Student Affairs operation under­
way and as that begins to gel, and
we understand where perhaps 
there are gaps that an ombuds­
man would fill, then we’ll make a 
decision.
“I think the general consensus 
is that we probably will [need an 
ombudsman].”
Murphy also addressed the 
question of his other former of­
fice. “Most of the things I did as 
coordinator of special projects are 
.appropriately housed in this of­
fice [Student Affairs], and I think 
some of the things I did as om­
budsman are fairly placed here 
too.”
Elliott is also adopting a wait- 
and-see position regarding the

ting to know each other.
Orientation consisted of four days of 
on-campus orientation that included 
addresses by President Cyert, Murphy, 
and other campus leaders. Other on- 
campus activities included a student 
services fair, a parents and students 
barbecue, a counselor coffeehouse, 
explanation of campus services, aca­
demic department meetings, and spe­
cial interest events including things 
like religion, Greek life, ROTC, and 
personal fitness. There were also so­
cial events like a Clippership cruise, 
“The Flow” playing at a reggae dance, 
and several events planned in the 
dorms.
The bulk of on-campus orienta­
tion, however, was done in small 
discussion groups of twenty or 
thirty students led by an orienta­
tion counselor and a resident assis­
tant. The discussions were designed 
to help freshmen get to know each 
other, to make them think about 
social issues, and to make them 
realize their full potential.
Planning for this year’s orienta­
tion began late in the fall semester 
of 1988. Amy Ginther, assistant 
director of housing for residence 
life, was part of a group of people on 
campus that former Dean of Stu-

Although it has not yet been completed, the new 
parking garage on Forbes Avenue has been put into 
partial service.
A total of 390 parking permits have been allocated 
for the 360 spaces now available, according to Parking 
Coordinator Sylvia Austin. Austin said that the Uni­
versity intentionally over-books almost all its parking 
lots in order to make more efficient use of them.
The spaces now available represent about 60 per­
cent of the 630 spaces planned for the finished garage. 
It is not yet known when the remaining spaces will 
begin to become available.
Director of Auxiliary Services Oscar Mayer said that 
the interior of the garage has been completed. The 
gates and sprinkler system are functioning and the 
garage is being patrolled by security. However, ma­
sonry work remains to be done as the outside of the 
garage is made to look like the new dormitory.
A ten foot wall will also be added to the top floor 
according to Thomas Murphy, Carnegie Mellon’s di­
rector of construction. The delay in making all of the 
spaces available stems from the fact that the contrac­
tors working on the garage require interior space to set 
up their equipment. The 360 available spaces will be 
located in different places in the garage at different 
times as the work is completed.

Former CMU student Darrell Van Mastrigt, who is serving a 
life sentence for the February 8,1987 stabbing death of Jeanne 
Goldberg, a 20-year-old business management student at Robert 
Morris College, had his lawsuit against the victim’s mother, 
CMU, and Delta Tau Delta thrown out of Allegheny County 
Common Pleas Court last week.
The lawsuit alleged that the victim’s mother “didn’t raise her 
daughter properly because the daughter had been drinking and 
may or may not have smoked marijuana” just prior to her death, 
according to Common Pleas Court Judge Ralph J. Cappy. The 
suit asserted that such behavior led to her death.
The suit alleged that CMU and DTD contributed to her death 
by allowing underage students to consume alcoholic beverages 
and to use marijuana. The suit also named the student who led 
Van Mastrigt to the party where he met his victim.
“There’s simply nothing in common law or statutory law that 
recognizes allegations of the sort filed by Mastrigt as the basis for 
a lawsuit,” Cappy said. He called the allegations “absurd.”

Cassie Ruane, a second-year grad student in GSIA, is the 
winner of a national entrepreneurship competition called “Moot 
Corp.” Ruane won with her business plan for CustomWare, Inc., 
a firm which creates proprietary software systems for corporate 
training departments.
Besides producing training materials tailored to the specific 
needs of users, Ruane’s company coordinates training sessions 
for corporate trainers and provides support services to clients. In 
existence since 1988, CustomWare’s software products have 
successfully passed the preliminary tests of customers.
Ruane competed against finalists from Harvard, the Univer­
sity of Michigan, the University of Pennsylvania, Purdue, and 
the University of Texas at Austin. The competition is sponsored 
by the University of Texas at Austin and is designed to give 
student entrepreneurs from top business schools the chance to 
match their efforts against their peers.
Ruane came up with the idea for CustomWare in her entrepre­
neurship classes, basing it on her experience as a marketing rep­
resentative for IBM.
Ruane offered praise for her GSIA advisor, Jack Thorne, who 
is the Morganthaler Professor of Entrepreneurship at CMU and 
chairman of Pittsburgh’s Enterprise Corporation.

BEIJING (AP) — China is 
denying Amnesty International’s 
charges that authorities carried 
out secret executions and mass 
arrests following the military 
crackdown in June.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Li 
Zhaoxing, at a weekly briefing, 
also said U.S. sanctions had “in­
fringed upon China’s dignity” and 
that the U.S. must be held re­
sponsible for deteriorating ties 
between the countries.
Li said claims by Amnesty In­
ternational that a “wave of 
repression” in China followed the 
June 3-4 military attack on stu­
dent-led protesters “are entirely 
ungrounded and unreasonable.”
Amnesty said it had sent Pre­
mier Li Peng a telex message 
urging the Chinese government
to “stop using judicial killing as a 
political tool” and to release all 
“prisoners of conscience.”
A statement released by the 
human rights group’s headquar­
ters in London said at least 1,000 
people were killed in the military 
attack on Beijing. The govern­
ment has said about 200 died in 
the crackdown.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi­
dent Bush made formal the ex­
pected U.S. rejection of the new 
Panamanian government ap­
pointed by Gen. Manuel Antonio 
Noreiga and said he plans to 
tighten existing sanctions against 
that country.
Bush said in a statement that 
the administration will “continue 
to take other steps ... to deprive
the illegal regime of funds that 
belong to the Panamanian 
people.” He did not elaborate.
Bush said the U.S. ambassador 
to Panama, Arthur Davis, called 
back to Washington last May, 
won’t return to Panama and there 
will be no diplomatic contact with 
the new authorities in Panama.
The text came on the last day of 
President Eric Arturo Delvalle’s 
term. He was ousted by Noriega
18 months ago but has been rec­
ognized by the U.S. in exile.
Bush said the United States 
will continue to support self-de­
termination and democracy for 
Panama and “counter the threat 
posed by General Noreiga’s sup­
port for drug trafficking and other 
forms of subversion.”
“I am confident that other gov­
ernments which support human 
rights, democracy, and self-deter- 
mination, and which opppose drug 
trafficking will take similar meas­
ures,” Bush said.

WASHINGTON (D J) — Chair­
man Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) of 
the Senate Finance Committee is 
examining ways to reduce capital 
gains taxes, increasing the 
chances that such a cut could be 
enacted this year.
The senator said he intends to 
ask his tax-writing panel to de­
vise a bill that would raise federal 
revenues about $8 billion in fiscal
1990, which begins Oct. 1. That 
would be enough to meet deficit- 
reduction targets while extend­
ing several soon-to-expire tax 
breaks, including the credit for 
research and development expen­
ditures.
As part of the tax package, a cut 
in the capital gains tax “is one of 
those things we’ll have to take a 
look at.”

BOGOTA (AP) — The U.S. has 
ordered all dependents of its 
embassy staff to leave Colombia. 
The order was given due to fears 
of attacks by drug traffickers.
Separately, nighttime curfews 
were imposed in the cocaine traf­
ficking center of Medellin and an 
outlying town to discourage bomb­
ings, arson, and other attacks by 
cocaine traffickers stung by the 
severe anti-narcotics offensive.
U.S. Embassy spokesman Pe­
ter Samson said he could not give 
further details on the order con­
cerning embassy dependents.
Samson said he could not give 
the motive for the measure, but it 
was related to Colombia’s cam­
paign against drug traffickers and 
plans to extradite suspects to the 
United States. The extradition of 
reputed Medellin cartel finance 
chief Eduard Martinez Romero is 
considered imminent.

Student government...
Relations between former Stu­
dent Government President Andy 
Robitshek and Student Senate 
were often strained over separa­
tion of powers issues. Problems 
came to a head after Robitshek 
formed a student committee to 
aid in the search for a new Uni­
versity president without consult­
ing Senate. A power struggle 
ensued over the rights of the 
President and the checks and 
balances in the Student Govern­
ment constitution, and Robitshek 
vetoed several Senate-sponsored 
changes to the constitution which 
seemed to give the Senate more 
power.
The election to replace Ro­
bitshek started out as a four can­
didate affair, and dropped to two 
in the final week. The two candi­
dates, Mark Mittelhauser and 
Mike Ference, had similar plat­
forms in a campaign dominated 
by a referendum which would have 
turned 37 percent of Greek stu­
dent activities fee money over to 
the Greek Council. Both candi­
dates came out against the kick- 
back, but there was widespread 
belief on campus that Ference, a 
fraternity member, was much 
more sympathetic to Greek con­
cerns than Mittelhauser, an inde­
pendent. In the largest turnout in 
recent years, Mittelhauser over­
whelmingly defeated Ference.
Former President Robitshek 
had focused on the University 
Center near the end of his two- 
year stint, while Mittelhauser has 
stated that his administration will 
stress human relations and envi­
ronmental concerns. Relations 
between Mittelhauser, who was 
Senate’s Campus Affairs chair 
before his election, and Senate 
are expected to be better than his 
predecessor’s.
For many of you, your time at Carnegie Mellon 
has just begun. However, even though you were 
not here, many things were happening. While 
many of the stories The Tartan has covered in the
past are now confined to history, others will be 
back this year and in future years.
The Tartan presents this analysis of some of the 
major stories we have covered in recent years to
help new members of the campus community 
understand the ongoing issues, as well as refresh 
the memories of everyone else who spent their 
summer trying to forget Carnegie Mellon.
Construction...
The new dorm, football field, intramural fields, and parking 
garage, collectively known as the East Campus Project, will be 
completed in stages throughout the school year, missing the 
target completion date of August 1989. They form the first 
phase of the University’s Master Plan, which contains a new 
University Center, Performing Arts complex, and amphithea­
ter area.
The often-delayed University Center was intended to be the 
centerpiece of the plan, but a start date on construction is 
unknown. The latest delay was announced last semester and 
was attributed to a lack of funds; Carnegie Mellon will not start 
construction until it has raised $30 million for the new building. 
After the announcement, a coalition of student leaders was 
formed to organize a petition drive for the Center, which 
gathered over 2000 names in a little over a week. This summer, 
President Cyert formed a committee to evaluate the current 
situation. It will report to the Board of Trustees at their fall 
meeting.
The only pieces of construction completed last year were a 
new Physical Plant building in the Bureau of Mines complex 
and the Design/Build complex, a meeting-area built as an 
undergraduate architecture project, which is located across 
from the Fence. The new Physical Plant building was part of the 
Master Plan; Design/Build was a student-designed, funded, 
and built project, unrelated to the Master Plan.
CFA in turmoil...
New CFA Dean David Burgess joins a college which has 
made a lot of news recently. The college’s quadrennial Beaux 
Arts Ball was cancelled after concerns over the possibility of 
under-aged drinking forced the Ball from its traditional home 
of the College of Fine Arts building to Metropol, a nightclub in 
Pittsburgh’s Strip District. Student Affairs cited two reasons 
for the move: the previous Ball’s $50,000 damage to the CFA 
building, and large amounts of under-aged drinking.
The move off-campus was intended to allow the event to go 
on without the University assuming liability for problems. 
However, after extremely slow sales, the event was opened up 
to the entire campus instead of being restricted to CFA 
students, as originally planned, and was then cancelled. In all, 
less than fifty tickets were sold.
Two years ago, students protested when the glass program 
appeared to be on the verge of being eliminated. Recently the 
art department cancelled the program.
Carnegie Mellon Sports...
Despite the lack of outdoor athletic fields, several Carnegie 
Mellon teams had outstanding years.
The women’s basketball team had its most successful sea­
son in its history with a 20-6 record, a President’s Athletic 
Conference championship, and a trip to the NCAA MidEast 
regional playoffs.
The men’s cross-country team extended its NCAA record of 
consecutive dual meet victories to 100.
The men’s swimming team won its second PAC title and the 
men’s tennis team won its first title.
The men’s ultimate frisbee club, Mr. Yuk, also made it to the 
national collegiate championships. Mr. Yuk lost in the semi­
finals, finishing fourth.
Spirit won the men’s buggy competition for the third straight 
season, and the women’s buggy title for the second straight 
year.
The search for the next president...
Last year, President Cyert announced his intention to retire 
at the end of this academic year. Cyert has been president of 
Carnegie Mellon since 1972. Three search committees have 
been formed — one of trustees and a second of faculty mem­
bers. A student search committee reports to the faculty com­
mittee.
The search has already been narrowed from several hundred 
candidates to a handful.
Greek issues...
The fraternities and sororities survived the demise of the 
Inter-Fraternity Council, which was disbanded after the so­
rorities complained of a lack of representation last fall. The 
IFC has been replaced with a new governing body, the Greek 
Council, a looser confederation of the 14 fraternities and five 
sororities.
Greek concerns came back to the surface in the spring when 
a petition forced Student Senate to consider a referendum 
which would have given 37 percent of all Greek student 
activities fee money to the Greek Council. The referendum was 
supposed to be voted on at the same time as the student 
government president, but was delayed one week by Senate. 
The referendum, though, was never voted upon. The night 
before the vote was to be held, Greek Council decided to 
withdraw it after seeing considerable opposition.
Human relations ...
Charges of insensitivity to minority rights were heard 
several times throughout the year. The use of a sambo 
caricature on a calendar published by Student Affairs, and 
alleged discrimination by Campus Security while checking 
identification at the gymnasium and in stopping “suspicious” 
people, were two of several incidents cited.
A successful human relations conference was held last fall; 
more are being planned. Anew campus group, ONE, was also 
formed to promote human relations on campus.
Controversy over military research...
Ever since funds for the Software Engineering Insti­
tute were awarded to Carnegie Mellon by the Depart­
ment of Defense, it has caused controversy. A group of 
faculty members, led by Lincoln Wolfenstein, Jonathan 
Pressler, and Ravi Kannan, has come out against SEI and 
its research, as has a local activist, Vincent Eirene.
Opponents of SEI claim that the institute performs 
classified research, against the spirit of academia,and 
performs research that contributes to the Strategic De­
fense Initiative, known popularly as “Star Wars.”
SEI also has to worry about the effects of the Gramm- 
Rudman-Hollings budget reduction act. Senator Arlen 
Spector (R-Penn.) stepped into save SEI’s funding in the 
1989 budget, and may have to do the same for 1990.

Freshman orientation,mixed reception from students
continued from page 1
dent Affairs Braden Walter had 
called upon to assist in planning 
this year’s orientation. Ginther 
pointed out that since “there’s no 
‘Director of Orientation,’ it’s not 
just a one-office thing.” Commit­
tees, said Ginther, were formed 
from this group of people to dis­
cuss different aspects of orienta­
tion. It was from these discus­
sions that the ideas of small 
groups arose.
Murphy was appointed acting 
dean of Student Affairs on June 1, 
and he appointed Anne Witch­
ner, director of campus activities, 
as assistant dean of Student Af­
fairs. The two began to organize 
this year’s orientation.
“I was always involved with on- 
campus orientation,” Witchner 
said. She said she “always thought 
that we could do many of the 
things here with everyone that 
were done in the past for three or 
four hundred students [atcamp].”
Witchner contended that the 
on-campus program was success­
ful this year because of the com­
mitment of both the freshman
class and the counselors. “We had 
consistent participation in large 
numbers,” she said, citing the way 
this year’s counselors handled the 
change in their responsibilities.
The orientation staff that had 
been hired during the spring 
semester of1989 was composed of 
51 counselors and five head coun­
selors. The five head counselors
— Tanya Evanovich, Edwin 
Montgomery, Margaret O’Toole, 
John Silvestri, and C. J. Warner
— arrived on campus nine days 
early while the other counselors 
arrived three days early. “The 
head counselors really took over 
training,” said Witchner.
The four days of on-campus 
orientation concluded with an 
overnight retreat at the Heritage 
Reservation, a facility used by 
the local Boy Scout council. Heri­
tage is divided into three camps 
which are separated by a lake. To 
accommodate the entire freshman 
class, Carnegie Mellon used all 
three camps.
“Retreat was a disappointment. 
There were administrative prob­
lems for which I assume full re-
retreat get
sponsibility,” Murphy said. He 
described difficulties that arose 
“in getting people up there in time 
and from anticipating a level of 
service [at Heritage] that was 
incorrect.”
“We tried to do something dif­
ferent with retreat. With so much 
structure, we thought that the 
students mightenjoy twenty-four 
hours of unstructured ‘playtime.’ 
We learned that people need some 
degree of structure,” said Witch­
ner.
But poor organization may not 
have been the only problem at 
retreat. H&SS freshman Stephen 
Kang describes an incident that
continued from page 1
ombudsman. “We need to deter­
mine how much of the responsi­
bilities of the former ombudsman 
position were actually the repon- 
sibility of the Student Affairs of­
fice. I’ve heard estimates as high 
as eighty percent.”
Don Hale, Carnegie Mellon’s
occurred at one camp: “At night, 
some people went really wild. 
They ran around and pulled down 
about twenty tents.” According to 
Kang, the people whose tents were 
pulled down were forced to sleep 
in the cabins provided for the ori­
entation staff.
Kang went on to describe an­
other incident that occurred 
around a campfire where “there 
were no girls, so some of the guys 
got restless. They started yelling 
that [the male/female] ratio at 
CMU sucks,” he said. “Then they 
started throwing greasy potato 
chips and pretzels into the camp­
fire because they would explode
vice president for University Re­
lations, said of Murphy, “He’s a 
hell of a guy.” Hale gave his im­
pressions of Student Affairs un­
der Murphy: “I was very im­
pressed with the way freshman 
orientation went. Student Affairs’ 
enthusiasm and the organization 
that they brought to this year’s
after being in there a few seconds. 
Then someone threw in a butane 
lighter, which really exploded.” 
After the lighter exploded, said 
Kang, the group dispersed. Kang 
saw no counselors in the area at 
the time.
Problems aside, Murphy said 
the freshman class was “a really 
fun group of students who made 
camp fun. The counselors and RAs 
were unbelievable. Despite what 
were some unfortunate problems, 
there still existed a lot of enthusi­
asm.”
Murphy conceded that retreat 
was not the success it could have 
been. “I think we’re on the right
freshman orientation said to me 
that things are really going to be 
going quite well. That impressed 
me.
“I think that’s indicative of the 
way Mike goes about his job and 
the atmosphere that now exists 
in Student Affairs where the 
people are really enthusiastic
track, but we have to admit our 
failure. Retreat was a missed 
opportunity.”
Looking to the future, Murphy 
expressed hope that more stu­
dent organizations would take an 
active role in next year’s orienta­
tion. He mentioned a “mini-ac­
tivities fair” as a potential orien­
tation event in the future.
Student Affairs will soon be 
evaluating this year’s orientation. 
Shortly thereafter, planning will 
begin for next year’s program. 
Murphy said he hopes to hire next 
year’s counselors before the end 
of this semester, so that training 
may begin in the spring.
about doing the job.”
Hale also had nothing but posi­
tive things to say about former 
Dean Walter. “In the time I’ve 
been here I’ve had to work with 
Brad in any number of crisis situ­
ations and I have to say that in a 
crisis situation, Brad Walter wat 
an excellent person.”

4The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 6 September 1989
f"— mltmons Mnlssbn8U.tM 1u8Mul4x C.s4ltInos sIaC.8
By RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Staffuiriter
Shari Zoila lights up a cigarette 
and breathes a stream of smoke 
in a frustrated sigh. “I think it’s 
ridiculous that this is an art 
sphool, yet we don’t have any glass 
facilities or any access to those 
materials,” she said. “Most of the 
people I’ve talked to are just very 
upset about the whole thing.”
¦ As of last summer, all of the 
glassblowing facilities have been 
dismantled and removed from 
their former location in the base­
ment of Doherty Hall, with the 
atea being reclassified as non­
designated, or “unprogrammed” 
space.
Current plans are for the area 
to be open to all art students and 
faculty for studio work, installa­
tions, critiques, meetingB, and 
other related purposes.
"Over the course of the summer, 
students who had pre-registered 
for either 60-246 Sculpture I: 
Form and Surface, or 60-446 
Advanced Sculpture: Glass were 
sent letters indicating that those 
classes had been cancelled. “CMU 
has such a big art college located 
here, and it’s well known for its 
art program,” said freshman 
Industrial Design major Kris 
Brescoll, “you shouldn’t pull an 
art class. I could understand if I 
was at Rensselaer and somebody 
pulled glassblowing, but you don’t 
do that at CMU.”
Junior painting major Sarah 
Smith was one of those who got a 
letter telling her she would have 
to choose another course. “It was 
a unique thing to this university
“It was a unique thing to this university 
to have a glassblowing facility. It’s a 
shame E we wonder what’s next ”
E Junior Sarah Smith
to have a glassblowing facility, 
and we had a very good depart­
ment,” said Smith. “It’s a shame 
— we wonder what’s next.”
According to Art Department 
Head Bryan Rogers, the current 
circumstances are the result of a 
much older problem. “I came into 
an existing situation,” said Ro­
gers, who is serving his second 
year as head of the Art Depart­
ment. “Apparently there is a much 
longer history, and there are many 
different versions ofthathistory.”
A primary reason for the termi­
nation of the program is the ab­
sence of Catherine Mulcahy, the 
only teacher for the classes. Mul­
cahy was denied tenure two years 
ago, and was appealing the ruling 
last year. It was not until this 
summer that her request was 
rejected.
Rogers maintains that her fate 
was uncertain at the time the 
schedule of classes was printed 
last semester. “Everything was 
in limbo,” said Rogers.
Another major factor was en­
rollment. Only seven people pre­
registered for 60-246, and only 
two registered for 60-446. For 
comparison, the next lowest pre­
registration numbers in an art 
course was twelve, in both Paint­
ing I and II. “Somewhere around 
eight or nine is our cut-off point,”
said Rogers.
Though many students typi­
cally wait until the beginning of 
the semester to register for such 
courses, Rogers said thatfor some 
time now, registration in
glassblowing classes has been of 
a cyclical nature, and visibly de­
clining in recent years. It is for 
this reason that he said he had to 
examine the cost effectiveness of 
continuing the program.
Still, some students say they 
were planning on registering for 
one of the courses this semester. 
“I really wanted to take it,” said 
sophomore Charlie Castaneda. 
“I’m really upset that they did 
away with it.” Junior Steve Wilk­
inson said he was looking for­
ward to adding glassblowing to
his work. “I’m starting to get really 
frustrated,” said Wilkinson. “I en­
joy using a great deal of materi­
als, not just welding, not just 
ceramics. I really wanted to in­
corporate glass.”
Aside from cost and enrollment 
considerations, however, Rogers 
said the nature of glassblowing 
itself had raised some uncertainty 
among the faculty.
“There were questions about the 
viability of glass as an educational 
vehicle in an undergraduate pro­
gram,” said Rogers. In this re-
spect opinion is mixed, even 
among students, “I know there 
are a lot of people who are upset 
about it,” said senior sculpture 
major Simon Gatrall, “but I think 
there are a lot of new things that 
are happening that are more in­
teresting. Things are changing.” 
Rogers suggests that glass blow­
ing is better suited to graduate 
level study. “Glass requires a very 
highlyfocusedability in the craft. 
I think the undergraduate pro: 
gram can’t afford to be that highly 
focused.”
Garage goes on line as 
construction continues
continued from page 1
•Murphy said that the remain­
ing construction should take about 
fiye or six months. It is not clear 
when it will be completed because 
the construction may have to be 
halted around December because 
ofweather and resumed in March. 
However, in the event of a mild 
winter it is possible that the work 
might not have to be stopped at 
all.
IThe University has acquired a 
six-month temporary occupancy 
permit for the garage from the 
city. Mayer expects to have to 
renew the permit in February 
when it expires. The city will not 
issue a permanent occupancy 
permit until it has had an oppor­
tunity to inspect the final struc­
ture.
In addition to serving as a park­
ing facility, the garage will also
support 3500 grandstand seats 
and a two story press box for the 
new Tech Field on its South wall. 
There will be concession stands 
and restrooms below the seats. 
The basement of the garage will 
serve as storage space for physi­
cal plant. The grandstands and 
other facilities are scheduled to 
be finished long before the reno­
vation of Tech Field which is 
expected to be completed in May 
or June with the installation of 
the artificial turf.
The garage is being built with 
borrowed money and its cost is 
expected to slightly exceed the 
original estimate of $6.7 million 
according to Vice President for 
Business Affairs Frederick Ro­
gers. Rogers said the excess cost 
was not unusual for such projects 
and would not create a problem 
for the University.

A Dining Service employee 
crossing Forbes Avenue was 
struck by a westbound vehicle 
Tuesday afternoon.
Carnegie Mellon Campus Po­
lice would not release the names 
of either the driver or the victim, 
but The Tartan was able to learn 
that the victim, a female, was 
treated and released from Pres­
byterian University Hospital in 
Oakland.
According to Sgt. William Ricci 
of Campus Police, the woman was
crossing south on Forbes near 
Devon Road, which is just in froot 
of Beta Theta Pi. She stepped ifto 
the street in front of a bus or tnick 
that was stopped in the right h£nd 
lane.
As she crossed in front of the 
stopped vehicle, another :ar 
locked up its brakes and swerred 
from the right lane into the left 
lane to avoid hitting the stopped 
vehicle.
The car then struck the wonan 
with the right-side passenger 
door, before stoppingin the busies 
near the entrance io the Sklbo 
Parking Area.
Senior Gale King, who was 
standing on the Beta porch at the 
time of the incident, looked up 
when he heard the screech of tires, 
and saw “the woman turn [away] 
to brace herself. Then the side of 
the car hit her. She rolled about
10 feet, and then she stood up, 
walked over here to the sidewalk 
where she collapsed.”
“After [the driver of the car] 
ended up in the bushes, he was 
gunningthe accelerator—like he 
was trying to get the car to move. 
Then the exhaust backfired, the 
car stalled, and the guy got out of 
the car,” said to Jeff Byard, who
was talking with friends near the 
lamp post at Devon Road when he 
witnessed the woman being struck 
by the car.
“She got up almost instantly,”
Byard explained, “and began 
walking toward the side of the 
road. She collapsed on the [Beta] 
lawn.”
Both witnesses agreed that the 
car was traveling over the legal 
speed limit; however, city police 
did not charge or cite the driver 
with any violations.

Eirene protests liew military contracts, closed studio
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan News Editor
“Aw, what’re they protesting 
today?”
That’s what an anonymous 
passerby called back as she 
walked by a group of protestors 
holding a red banner in front of 
Doherty Hall: “Disarm Camegie- 
Mellon.”
Activist Vincent Eirene and a 
group of supporters held a dem­
onstration Tuesday to protest the 
expansion of military research 
and the removal of glassblowing 
from the Fine Arts curriculum. A 
warrant is out for his arrest, but 
Eirene was not arrested during or 
after the protest.
Eirene had been arrested Au­
gust 6 for a protest staged at the 
Software Engineering Institute 
to commemorate the anniversary 
of the atomic bombing of Hiro­
shima. Eirene was released 
shortly afterward because of 
prison overcrowding. He had 
failed to appear for his August 16 
trial and a warrant was issued for 
his arrest.
Eirene’s associate Kevin For­
sythe and some supporters ap­
peared in front of Doherty Hall 
around noon holding a banner 
which read “Disarm Camegie- 
Mellon.” Eirene was scheduled to 
appear at 12:30 to face arrest.
Carnegie Mellon doesn’t want attention 
brought to the Software Engineering 
Institute.
— SEI protestor Vincent Eirene
As time went on, Eirene began 
to voice doubt that he would be 
arrested, at least on campus. “At 
this point I don’t think they’ll 
arrest me. I think they’ll wait 
until the crowd dies down.” 
Eirene had made a similar
appearance on campus in Febru­
ary when another warrant was 
out for his arrest. “It’s like the 
last situation with the Valentine’s 
Day party. They don’t want at­
tention brought to the Software 
Engineering Institute.”
Students had little to say about 
the protest.
About the controversy concern- - 
ing military research on campus,- 
chemistry grad student Jeff, 
Hrkach spoke for his friends: “We. . 
haven’t thought about it.”
Junior Kristen Burgard re­
ferred to the embroilment over ¦ 
Eirene’s accusation of SEI and^ 
CMU research on nuclear ‘arms’:,7 
“Cut off their legs, too.”
As of Sunday evening, Eirene. „ 
had not been arrested.

Campus Police were on the setae 
as of about noon, but had leftby 
about 12:15.
The protestors passed out baf- 
lets entitled “While you were avay 
this summer...” to the crovd of 
students exiting their il:30 
classes. The leaflet regarjed a 
“contract from the Army coicera- 
ing a computer center that/vould 
involve several nuclear wapons 
systems.”“The University abbied 
clandestinely for this rilitary 
contract,” reads the leaflet,“which
students and faculty only learned 
about after an article appeared in 
The Pittsburgh Press. Also this 
summer, after prolonged debate, 
the glass studio was closed.” 
Eirene told The Tartan that he 
expected to get arrested by Cam­
pus Police when he appeared for 
the protest. Sgt. William Ricci of 
Campus Police would say only 
that “If he shows up, it’s our op­
tion [to arrest him].” By the time 
Eirene arrived, however, Cam­
pus Police had left the scene.

it as “a couple of handfuls.” On 
August 14 the steering commit­
tee narrowed the search to a “short 
list.”
Junior art major Ingrid 
Bromberg, a member of the stu­
dent committee, said the short 
list should contain three or four 
names. The full student commit­
tee was not told the names on the 
short list; members are either 
unsure or refuse to confirm if any 
student knows the composition of 
the list.
Students participating in these 
interviews were drawn from a pool 
of students who serve on the stu­
dent committee. Students on the
names of the students who served 
in this interview pool. When asked 
which students interviewed can­
didates, Bromberg said she was 
“not at liberty to say. They don’t 
want to have pressure applied-to 
students to release names [of 
candidates]. Already people I 
know have pressured me to re­
lease names.”
Explaining the need for strict 
confidentiality, graduate student 
Tamal Mukherjee said, “if any 
leaks take place, the first place 
they will look is the student com­
mittee and then students will be 
left out [of the rest of the search] 
entirely.”
Committee member Marc Ros-
the interviews were conducted in 
such strict confidentiality. “It’s 
discouraging that we all don’t get 
to know the information from the 
interviews. Some [committee 
members] know more than oth­
ers.... It’s hard for us to form opin­
ions when we don’t have the in­
formation,” said Roston.
According to Rao, decisions on 
the medium and short lists have 
been made by “a consensus ap­
proach among faculty and trus­
tees, and for the most part, stu­
dents. Then again, no difficult 
decisions have been made to date.” 
Rao reports the opinion of the 
students to the steering commit­
tee, of which he is a member.
mittee advises only the faculty 
committee and not the steering 
committee. Mukherjee “expect[s] 
the student consensus to be al­
most identical to the trustee and 
faculty opinions.”
“There’s really been an effort to 
involve the students at every step 
so far,” says co-chair Franco.
Roston disagrees. He thinks 
“that it has been unfortunate that 
our participation is less than 
hoped. Some of us are beginning 
to think that our role is largely 
symbolic.”
Originally, the student commit­
tee was commissioned only to 
write a “white paper” of student 
concerns, which will be presented
The student committee, however, 
lobbied to be more involved in the 
early stages of the interviewing. 
Apparently, the full student 
cotnmittee will not be allowed to 
interview candidates on the “short 
list” unless they are willing to 
announce publicly that they are 
candidates;
Based on, the information pro­
vided by the trustee and faculty 
seàrch committees, the steering 
committee vpll reduce the short

steering committee will then rec- 
ominend thai the Board of Trus­
teed approve that candidate.

The search began in January 
when Richard M. Cyert an­

after seventeen years as presi­

the price of the construction had 
gotten too high, saying, “I have 
had a sense over the last few 
months that there was a real 
danger of the project going se­
verely over budget.”
Frederick Rogers, Carnegie 
Mellon’s vice president for busi­
ness affairs, denied that financial 
concerns had delayed the dormi­
tory. He said that it became ap­
parent that neither wing of the 
dorm would be ready by January 
and therefore the decision was 
made that there was no reason to 
continue rushing one wing at a 
greater cost. The original esti­
mate for the dorm, including the 
400 seat, three area dining facil­
ity in the east wing, was $15 
million. Rogers said the estimate 
now stands at about $19 million. 
He said that the additional cost is 
not unusual for this type of proj­
ect and the University will be
able to pay back the money bor­
rowed to build the dorm without 
serious difficulties. Rogers char­
acterized the loss of a year’s worth 
of dorm fees as a problem but said 
that no serious policy changes, 
such as higher room rates, would 
be required to compensate for it.
According to University Archi­
tect Paul Tellers, the original plan
to have the dorm ready by this 
semester was an optimistic one.

Getting a full education
Another school year has begun, 
which means it’s time once again 
for something that’s becoming a 
bit of a tradition at The Tartan: 
our annual editorial intended to 
offer some wisdom on how to get 
through Carnegie Mellon and even 
like it.
Although the tuition bills may 
say otherwise, we feel that the 
real education you’re going to get 
here will not be taught by your 
professors. It will be taught by 
your fellow students.
Ten years from now, few of us 
will look back on fond memories of 
calculus lectures in Doherty Hall 
2210. But many of us will cherish 
our participation on the buggy 
team that finished 14th or remem­
ber fondly how we used to march 
in crooked lines in the Kiltie Band. 
We’re going to remember our 
friends and our laughter, not our 
notetaking, our papers, or our cri­
tiques.
Last Thursday, 82 organizations 
participated in the Activities Fair, 
an event which allowed students 
to sign up and get involved. And 
although the fair is over, just about 
every group on campus is still 
looking for members.
And whether you’re interested 
in WRCT, a Greek organization, 
or AIESE C, we at The Tartan urge 
you to take advantage of some 
opportunity to get involved with 
the non-academic side of Carne­
gie Mellon. “Get it While the get­
ting’s good,” goes the adage — 
wise words we’d all do well to 
heed.
Once this issue comes out and 
we at the paper breathe a collec­
tive sigh of relief, we’re going to 
carefully wrap up this editorial 
and put it in the box until next 
year. It’s a message that bears 
repeating.
Near-perfect orientation 
needed more organization
The verdict is in, and it rules 
favorably for this year’s freshman 
orientation. Against seemingly 
overwhelming odds, Acting Dean 
of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy and his band of orienta­
tion counselors managed to pull 
together a coherent program in 
just three months after former 
Dean Brad Walter’s departure 
earlier this summer.
Murphy restructured the pro­
gram to focus on smaller orienta­
tion groups and placed a retreat, 
previously known as camp, after 
the on-campus portion of orienta­
tion. The new structure provided 
greater opportunities for fresh­
men to participate in a more help­
ful and orienting program. Orien­
tation staff members and this 
year’s RAs deserve ample praise 
for making the restyled orienta­
tion a memorable success.
Unfortunately, the great success 
of the on-campus portion of orien­
tation was tempered somewhat

Architects should keep off the grass
by a poorly organized retreat. 
While many freshmen reported 
that they enjoyed camp, others 
felt it was mismanaged. Most 
attendees mentioned a lack of or­
ganization attributable to poor 
communications and a smaller- 
than-needed staff.
These concerns need to be exam­
ined further, and we hope that 
next year’s orientation retains all 
the good qualities of this year’s 
while addressing this year’s prob­
lems. This was the first year with 
a new program, new leadership, 
and a new location; there were 
bound to be some kinks in the 
system.
For now, we’d like to thank 
Murphy, Anne Witchner, Ron 
Campana, and the five head coun­
selors — Tanya Evanovich, Ed­
win Montgomery, Margaret 
O’Toole, John Silvestri, and C.J. 
Warner — for an orientation that 
was, on the whole, truly excep­
tional given the circumstances.
Editor:
I find myself in an awkward position 
with regard to the planned University 
Center. On the one hand, I heartily 
endorse the creation of major University 
facilities for enhancement of the “quality 
of life” at CMU. I believe the University 
suffers a great deal from a lack of high 
quality recreational and other non-aca­
demic facilities. On the other hand, I 
dislike intensely what has been planned 
for us by The Architects. This letter is an 
attempt to stimulate discussion.
I admit that I have great difficulty 
with much of what seems to be highly re­
garded in architectural circles. I’ve been 
to Fallingwater three times now with 
various visiting friends who expressed 
interest in seeing the architectural 
Masterpiece. Who am I to say such a
Letters to the Editor
thing, but I will — I think it’s a stupid 
building. I’m told the Kaufmans origi­
nally wanted tobuildahouse with a view 
of a beautiful waterfall. Frank Lloyd 
Wright, of course, knew better what his 
clients should want; the waterfall needed 
to be integrated into the house. This 
seems to be a common architectural 
theme — buildings pounce upon things 
of beauty so as to give them architectural 
definition.
This, it seems to me, is what is planned 
for the Cut. Presently, it is a wide open 
grassy area in the heart of the campus 
where people play barefoot frisbee, touch 
football, run, jump, catch, and smell
freshly mowed grass in the spring. “A- 
ha!,” say The Architects, “a place in need 
of architectural definition; we’ll wall it in 
with colonnades — long, skinny build­
ings of unimaginable use — but able to 
destroy a large open space.”
I say we should tell The Architects to 
implement their grand architectural 
visions elsewhere; we should keep our 
open grassy area as part of our recrea­
tional resources. We don’t need a health 
club for a University Center; we need 
high quality athletic and student organi­
zation facilities which impact as little as 
possible on a crowded campus which has 
managed, until now, to preserve some 
open, green space.

The following is an open letter from 
Student Government President Mark Mit- 
telhauser. —-Ed.
As President of the Student Govern­
ment, I would li£e to welcome everyone 
back to campus and extend a special 
welcome to the freshmen.
As you can see by looking around 
campus, much has happened over the 
summer. The East Campus Project, 
though behind schedule, is entering the 
final stages of construction. The new 
dormitory will most likely be included in 
April’s room draw, and the parking ga­
rage, already partially operational, 
should be finished before next semester, 
openingup approximately 300 additional 
spaces to the campus community. Also, 
one of the intramural fields will be ready 
for use in the spring, provided the grass 
takes hold. Another welcome change this 
year is the further renovation^of class­
rooms around the campus. Expect to find 
improved lighting, more carpeting, and 
desks that accommodate left-handed 
students.
The administration has seen many 
organizational changes, most notably in 
Student Affairs where Michael Murphy 
has been made Acting Dean while the 
search for Braden Walter’s replacement 
continues. In the interim, Murphy has a 
variety of promising activities planned 
for the fall, including Human Relations 
conferences and night time safety semi­
nars.
The most significant choice in the 
coming months, however, is the selec­
tion of Carnegie Mellon’s next president. 
Over the summer, the “long list” of can­
didates was shortened to a “medium list,” 
and the Student Search Committee inter­
viewed every prospective President. Now 
a “short list” has been determined and a 
final decision should be rendered by 
December. Up to this point, student input 
into the selection process has been excel­
lent. As the decision draws closer we can 
look forward to increased student input.
There are a lot of other things to look 
forward to in the coming year. The escort 
is going to run twenty-four hours a day, 
ensuring safe transport of students to 
and from campus at any hour of the day 
or night, the Health Center will expand 
its hours of operation to make health 
care more accessible to the CMU 
community, and a new, central bulletin 
board will be built in Grey Matter within 
the month to serve as the central source 
for information on student activities — 
Greek and non-Greek alike.
In spite of our recent progress, how­
ever, there is still much to be done. The 
most pressingissue when we left campus 
in May was funding for events sponsored 
by the Greek community that are open to 
the entire campus. This, and the ques­
tion of buggy funding are two important 
issues that must be resolved as soon as 
possible. We need to have extensive, open 
communication so that we can eliminate 
the underlying misunderstandings that 
created the situation and are contribut­
ing to the apparent rift between Greeks 
and non-Greeks on campus.
Another issue is student transporta­
tion. With more students living in the 
Squirrel Hill area, there is an increasing 
perception that a Squirrel Hill shuttle 
may be necessary. We are also on our 
way to establishing a Women’s Center, 
but questions remain about its location 
and the services it will provide. Finally, 
we are in the process of implementing a 
comprehensive recycling program at 
Carnegie Mellon. The planning is nearly 
complete, and all that remains is the 
step-by-step coordination.
Since both the Student Senate and 
myself will be addressing these concerns 
this year, I would like to clarify the 
relationship between the Student Sen­
ate and my position. We represent two 
branches of Student Government, the 
Senate being the legislative and the 
President forming the executive. While 
our overall goal—strong representation 
of student interests — is the same, our 
responsibilities and methods differ. My 
primary method for getting things done 
is to create external committees which 
address concerns in a direct, effective 
manner. You don’t need to run for an 
office to work on a presidential commit­
tee — just express your interest to my­
self or the committee’s Chair. I am now 
in the process of forming seven commit­
tees. Four of them are new: 
Environmental Concerns: This 
committee will work towards an envi­
ronmentally sound CMU by advocating 
policies like energy conservation, 
banning styrofoam from campus and 
using renewable resources. The student 
effort in coordinating a comprehensive 
university recycling effort will also be 
managed through this committee.
Diversity: This committee will have 
a daunting conceptual task: that of help­
ing us all to understand that the differ­
ences among us should bring us together 
and enrich our lives, not isolate us and 
create animosity. The committee will 
sponsor and plan events designed to il­
lustrate this point.
University Center: This committee 
will be the central source for student 
input into the construction of the pro­
posed University Center. It will work to 
keep students up-to-date with develop­
ments on this issue and it will actively 
solicit student opinions and student in­
volvement.
Student Involvement Committee: 
This is the “enthusiasm” committee of 
the former Student Government Presi­
dent, but with a greatly expanded focus. 
Not only will the committee publicize 
campus events, it will work to make sure 
that activities don’t all occur on the same 
night, with nothing to do for the rest of 
the week. In addition, the committee will 
work to attract more diverse audiences 
to campus events.
Three committees are continuing from 
previous years:
Senior Gift: This committee plans 
the gift that graduating seniors tradi- 
continued on page 8
Neighbors offer housing update
Editor:
As the neighbors mentioned promi­
nently in your recent article on the prob­
lem of overoccupancy in off-campus 
housing [“Neighbors’ groups complain 
over violations of 3-person rule,” 3/21], 
we wish to call attention to recent devel­
opments. The landlords and owners of 
the house at 5240 Forbes Avenue were 
summoned to Housing Court by the city 
of Pittsburgh on April 27,1989, and after 
extensive testimony presented by the 
city attorney, a fine of $10,000 was 
imposed upon them. Although the six 
students in residence at that address 
were subpoenaed and were in attendance,
they were not called to testify in view of 
the city’s evidence of overoccupancy.
It is our hope that this case will give 
fair warning to landlords, to realtors, 
and to students that the City’s Law De­
partment and the Squirrel Hill Urban 
Coalition intend to pursue violations of 
the Housing Code in order to preserve 
the quality of the neighborhood.
This experience has not been pleasant 
for any of the parties involved and we 
hope that we can put it all behind us and 
get on with the business of livinglawfully 
in harmony with one another.

Whoever said, “You can’t go 
home again” was lying. You can 
go home again, but once you’re 
there, you’ll just find that you 
want to leave.
I spent 48 hours at home this 
summer, enough time for me in 
middle-class suburban New 
York. As I grow older, I realize 
that home seemed more excit­
ing when I was younger simply 
because I didn’t know any bet­
ter. Now I do, as do most of my 
childhood friends. They’ve left 
home too.
One of them, in fact, has fol­
lowed me to Carnegie Mellon, 
even though he’s four years late. 
Bob and I went to high school 
together and both headed to 
college looking to become com­
puter engineers — he at Clark­
son, and me here. Now we find 
ourselves at GSIA.
I feel sorry for Bob. I’ve just 
spent a week trying to make the 
freshmen comfortable with our 
campus, but no one has done so 
for Bob and the other graduate 
students who have come here 
from other universities or in­
dustry.
I received a letter from him 
after he had found a place to 
live in Squirrel Hill. It had the 
typical questions, “Where do I 
go?” “What do I do on the week­
ends?” “Why is the ‘O’ so 
crowded?”
I’m sure that he’s not the only 
one with these questions. Let’s 
face it, this is not your typical
college, and Pittsburgh is not 
your average city. Do students 
at other schools purposefully go 
out into the cold at 6 am on 
weekends to push go-carts? Do 
people in other cities drink Iron 
City Beer?
We need a way of acclimating 
grad students into CMU soci­
ety. We may not be able to teach 
all of the old dogs new tricks, 
but we can at least let them 
know where Doherty Hall is.
It’s time for Carnegie Mellon 
to start an “Adopt a Graduate 
Student” campaign. Match a 
sophomore or junior up with 
each incoming grad to show him 
or her the ropes. Teach them 
that it is not cool to hang out in 
Grey Matter, that you should 
not sit on the Fence unless you 
plan on painting it, and that 
“pushers” are not automatically 
arrested here, but that pro­
testors are.
If undergrads don’t think it’s 
worth their time, remember 
this, your adopted grad student 
will more than likely be 21 (or 
much older), definitely a plus 
considering Pennsylvania’s 
current liquor laws.
And if any of you out there 
run into my friend Bob, please 
be easy on him. He’s just spent 
four years in upstate New York 
and thinks that Pittsburgh is 
an exciting place. Humor him 
for a while—he’ll learn better 
soon enough.

“And now taking the field, your 
2001 Pittsburgh Pirates!”
The stadium announcer had just 
finished introducing the team and 
the starting pitcher was making 
his warmup pitches when I saw 
the security guard approach the 
man in the seat next to me.
“I’jn going to have to arrest you, 
sir,’’said the guard. “Please follow 
me.”
“What are you taking about? I 
didn’t do anything,” the fan re­
plied,
“That’s just it, sir. You failed to 
remove your hat and salute the 
flag during the National Anthem. 
That is a violation of the National 
Symbols Statute of 1991. You also 
failed to sing the anthem, so I am
required to cite you under the 
Kespect for Patriotic Music Law 
1995.”
“He didn’t sing but he did move 
his lips,” I said, trying to sound 
helpfiil.
The security guard looked at 
me, apparently annoyed that I 
was interfering with his job. 
“Maybe the judge will let him off,” 
he said, “but for now I have to 
take him downstairs.”
“Who thinks up these stupid 
laws, anyway?” another fan yelled 
to the security guard.
“Many of them were proposed 
by Mr. Quayle back when he was 
vice president,” he replied.
“Oh, to hell with Quayle,” the 
fan shot back, “don’t he and those 
nitwits in congress have better 
things to do than pass stupid 
laws?”

wearing an NRA hat turned 
around. “I happen to support those 
laws,” he said. “And so do a lot of 
other patriotic Americans. I bring 
my kids to the ballpark and they 
shouldn’t have to listen to pinkos 
like you two make a mockery of 
our great institutions.” Turning 
to the security guard he said, “Why 
don’t you arrest this guy, too? 
He’s not allowed to talk about the 
president that way.”
“I’m afraid I can’t, sir,” the se­
curity guard replied. “The Chief 
Executive Respect Act of 1998, 
certifying the president as a na­
tional symbol, was struck down 
by the Supreme Court last year. 
However, it has been reintroduced 
as a constitutional amendment 
and is expected to be ratified by 
the end of this year.”
The security guard again asked 
the fan who had failed to remove
lawyer handy
his hat and sing along with the 
national anthem to come with 
him. The man looked to us for 
assistance but there was nothing 
more we could do. The man slowly 
followed the security guard down 
the aisle.
As they walked away, a woman 
in the row behind me leaned over 
and said, “These national sym­
bolism laws have gotten out of 
hand. I think I’m going to write a 
letter to the paper about this.”
“That’s a good idea,” I said, “but 
you’d better run the letter past 
your lawyer before you mail it. 
You’ve got to be careful these days 
to make sure that what you write 
is legal.”

CMU’s ultimate 
frisbee team places 
fourth in the nation
UT.ttor.lpyTs tyaTyt SNyk a SNp
By ROBIN HENSINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Saturday, the Men’s Cross- 
Country team extended its un­
beaten streak of dual-meet wins 
to reach a monumental 100th 
victory. This record is the best in 
the history of CMU.
The Tartans began their sea­
son on September 2 with a land­
slide victory against Duquesne 
University. CMU brought in the 
first eleven finishers with a score 
of 15-50 at Robert Morris College.
Leading the team in victory 
number 100 was senior Dave 
Supp, who ran an impressive race 
in 25:24. Supp, a reigning All- 
American in the 5K, shattered 
the course record by 20 seconds.
Runningin a pack close to Supp 
were teammates sophomore Russ 
Shorkey, senior Len O’Neal, and 
sophomore Jon Frieder. Head 
Coach Gary Meckley and co-cap­
tains Supp and O’Neal were 
impressed with Shorkey’s race as 
he finished an astonishing sec­
ond place in 25:43. O’Neal and 
Frieder also finished strong com­
ing in 3rd and 4th, respectively, 
in 25:54 and 25:55.
Following the leaders for CMU 
werejuniorDanHollandm26:19,
junior Gary Harrison in 26:37, 
senior Gary Meeker in 26:46, 
freshman Scott Phillips in 26:57, 
freshman Matt Stafford in 27:13, 
sophomore John Byrnes in 27:17, 
and sophomore Mike Damon in 
27:20. Damon finished only two 
seconds ahead of Baglio, the first 
Duquesne runner to cross the 
finish line.
Saturday’s meet was the first 
time the Tartans had ever run at 
Robert Morris. The course took 
them on grass, over pavement, 
through woods, and even up sev­
eral steps, but most of the run­
ners were pleased with the course. 
The hills were an asset to the 
team since many of the upper­
classmen runners were accus­
tomed to the hills on their home 
course in Schenley Park.
The Tartans have been unde­
feated since 1979 when they lost 
to Bethany College by one point. 
Along with the obvious talent of 
the CMU runners, their 100 con­
secutive wins can largely be at­
tributed to their Coach Meckley. 
Although the 100th victory was a 
milestone in the cross-country 
record, Meckley says “It’s just 
another day.” Since a few of the 
top seven runners will be gradu­
ating at the end of the year,

Mr. Yuk, Carnegie Mellon’s 
Ultimate Frisbee team, is now 
ranked number four in the na­
tion.
For the past several years 
the sport of ultimate frisbee 
has been steadily gaining 
popularity at schools all over 
the country. Carnegie Mellon 
University is no different.
Last May the team 
participated in the sixth 
annual Ultimate Players 
Association (UPA) National 
Collegiate Championships at 
University of North Carolina 
at Wilmington. This was the 
team members' fourth 
consecutive appearance in a 
national tournament.
After posting a healthy 14-4
regular season record, Mr. 
Yuk, lead by top players Greg 
Wolff, Ron Papanek, Darren 
Weidenman, and Sam 
Hendricks, finished fourth 
overall at the tournament. The 
highly skilled team bettered 
its previous years finish by 
three spots.
According to the UPA com­
puter rankings, which are 
independent from the playoffs, 
Carnegie Mellon was in the 
number seven spot.
The team pushed its way 
past many respectable 
opponents, including UNC at 
Wilmington, Princeton, and 
the US Naval Academy, only 
to fall to University of 
Pennsylvania in the semi­
finals.
No players were available 
for comment.
A member of Mr Yuk, Carnegie Mellon's Ultimate Frisbee Team that 
finished fourth in the nation, prepares for a pass.
Bart Giamatti died last week. 
He was 51 years old and, ac­
cording to Mr. Giamatti himself, 
(had the best job in the world.
He had been the commis­
sioner of baseball for only five 
months when he suffered a 
heart attack in his vacation 
home on Martha’s Vineyard.
His death came as a great shock 
|since he had always appeared 
so alive and in the news lately.
At least twice a week for the 
last three months, a picture or 
quote from Mr. Giamatti was in 
the paper or on TV in connec- 
r tion with the Pete Rose case.
Mr. Giamatti fought hard to 
“preserve the integrity of the 
game of baseball”—-the game 
which Mr. Giamatti loved, 
j This is not the time or place to 
! go into the specifics of the Rose 
incident. Mr. Giamatti banned 
the all-time hit leader from the 
game because, simply, Mr. Rose 
broke the cardinal rule of 
¡. baseball.
If Right or wrong, Mr. Giamatti 
did it, not for himself, not be­
cause he disliked Pete Rose, but 
because he wanted that which 
had aroused a passion in him 
his entire life, baseball, to 
continue to excite and influence 
kids and adults forever.
Even though he only had the 
job for five months, Mr. Gia­
matti proved early that he was 
right for it. He moved with swift 
; action on the Rose case and 
proved that he, like his prede­
cessor Peter Ueberroth, was an 
effective and firm administra­
tor. Above all, Mr. Giamatti 
possessed the one characteristic 
1 psential for the Commissioner’s 
job; he was a fan.
What a fortunate man he was. 
Can you imagine what a joy it 
must have been for him to go to 
work everyday knowing that he, 
* Eart, was actually running 
fmajor league baseball?
If only everybody could get a 
job dealing with something they 
have enjoyed their entire lives. 
But then, the world would be 
|filled with ballet dancers,
,,aremen, and baseball players. 
Then again, it might not be 
such a bad place after all.
Mr. Giamatti was the presi­
dent of Yale prior to becoming 
^baseball commissioner. I heard 
an interesting story about him 
over the summer from a gradu­
ate of Yale.
When this graduate was in 
his freshman year at Yale, his 
mother came to visit and was 
.shocked at how filthy the 
1 -athroom was in her son’s 
dormitory. She said she would 
call the president of the school 
and complain directly to him. 
That was the last the freshman 
heard about the incident.
A few years later, after he had 
graduated from Yale, that once 
young freshman with the filthy 
bathroom was at a formal 
dinner function in New York. 
tMr. Giamatti, still president of 
Yale, was seated at the digni­
tary’s table.
The cocky Yale graduate went 
°ver to Mr. Giamatti, intro­
duced himself and reminded the 
president of the bathroom 
¡incident. He then asked if his 
Bother did in fact call.
The president of Yale shook 
the graduate’s hand and said, 
"Michael, I remember that 
Phone call, and as I remember, 
We cleaned up your bathroom!”
He loved every job he had. He 
be remembered as a very 
fortunate and happy person.

Football starts season with a bust

By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Copy Manager
The football Tartans started the 
1989 season with a bust, losing 
11—10 to cross-town rival 
Duquesne. It was Duquesne’s 
first victory over CMU since 1981.
“We went out and beat our­
selves,” said Tartan halfback 
Dean Garofola. The Tartans 
turned the ball over four times, 
completed only six of fourteen 
passes, and three Tartan drives 
that started in Duke territory 
netted a total of three points.
Head Coach Rich Lackner 
summed the game up in four 
words, “we didn't play well.”
The game started with all the 
makings of a Tartan blowout. The 
Dukes’ first possession ended after 
three plays and a punt. Brad 
Williamson’s punt was touched 
down on the one after a twenty- 
yard roll.
Deep in their own end, the 
Tartans went to work. Runs by 
running back Scott Bamyak and 
quarterback Bill Snyder gave 
CMU some breathing room. Then, 
Snyder found flanker Mike 
Beresford open downfield with an 
electrifying pass which took the 
Tartans to midfield. From here, 
the backfield went back to work. 
Eight rushes later Dean Garofola 
found himself in the end zone, 
and the Tartans had a 7-0 lead.
Duquesne’s next drive gave 
CMU the only break it should 
have needed; however, like all of 
the other chances they received, 
the Tartans would not capitalize. 
On the first play from scrimmage, 
Duquesne quarterback fumbled 
the ball which was recovered by 
Ray Crothers on the Duke 19.
The Tartans didn't take 
advantage of the opportunity. On 
their first play, the normally sure- 
handedBamyakfumbled the ball
back over to Duquesne, ending 
the scoring threat.
The team could not get into 
sync afterwards. Two more first- 
half drives were stopped in Duke 
territory due to turnovers. 
Meanwhile, Duquesne was having 
offensive problems of its own, 
managing only a field goal in the 
first half.
The Tartans couldn’t get things 
going on their own, but Duquesne 
tried to help as best it could. 
Williamson shanked a punt which 
Barnyak was able to run back to 
the Duke 33. However, the 
Tartans could only move the ball 
anotherl2 yards and were forced 
to settle for a 38-yard Joe 
Schwerha field goal, and a 10-3 
lead going into the fourth quarter.
The fourth quarter proved 
deadly as the Duquesne offense 
came alive.The Dukes took the 
ball from midfield down to the

The Women’s Cross-Country 
team began their season by 
defeating Duquesne University 
21-35 Saturday at Robert Morris 
College.
The Tartans had a strong show­
ing on September 2 with the first 
two women finishing the race 
being from Carnegie Mellon; 
Leading the team on to victory 
was sophomore Carolyn Lowe 
coming in 19:35. Finishing sec-i 
ond was one of the Lady Tartan’s 
top runners, junior Kristin Bur- 
gard, who ran the race in 19:44.
The next fifteen places were 
taken alternatively between 
Duquesne and CMU. Duquesne’? 
first finisher, Bishop, came id! 
19:54. Following Bishop wa3 
CMU’s veteran runner, senior Sue 
Johnson who took fourth place iri 
20:09.
The first freshman to cross the 
finish line for CMU was Laura

Meckley stated that it is difficult 
to predict how long the team can 
continue its undefeated streak.
Meckley also said that he was 
not concerned with the streak at 
each meet, but with the potential 
of the team from year to year.
At times during the past eleven 
years, the undefeated streak was 
threatened when the coach chose
to rest his top runners for larger 
competitions and use his second 
team. The second team was al­
ways strong enough to keep the 
record alive. Meckley stated that 
the purpose of dual meets was “ to 
try different techniques.” 
According to O’Neal, “It was 
good to get the 100th win out of

Why play intramural sports? 
Last March 9 at the 41st an­
nual IM Night, several of the 
champions answered this ques­
tion. The response consisted of 
many positive answers.
The main reasons were that 
nearly everyone played Intra­
mural sports in order to re­
lieve the stress that builds up 
during classes, to take a break 
from studying, or to just get 
out and have a good time. One 
of the players from the 
Sudsuckers, last year’s cham­
pions in the majors of bowling 
and the minors in volleyball,
gave his reason for playing as the 
“only social activity that we have.” 
Robert Bowie, the most valu­
able player in Intramural foot­
ball and basketball, said that he 
played IM because he loves sports 
and didn’t have the time to invest 
in varsity athletics.
A vast majority of the Carnegie 
Mellon community shares this 
enthusiasm. Last year a cumula­
tive total 3,637 people partici­
pated in IM sports. In addition to 
the many students that played in 
the games, faculty and staff 
members also participated.
The top three teams in the final 
standings for all school points for 
last year were Spirit in first, 
Korean Student Association in
second and Sigma Alpha Epsi­
lon in third. The final standings 
consist of calculating which 
team won the most titles.
In addition to the various 
sports thathave their deadlines 
approaching, the Carnegie 
Mellon Triathlon has been 
moved to the fall. The triathlon 
will be held on September 30, 
the only weekend that the Car­
negie Mellon football teamisn’t 
scheduled to play. The triath­
lon will consist of a 400 yard 
swim, 10 miles on a bicycle and 
a 5K run.
For more information please 
contact Donna Morosky at 
x2213 or call the Intramural 
Office at x2214.

Tartan soccer team defeated in 
season opener at Brandéis
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Copy Manager
WALTHAM, Mass. — The soc­
cer Tartans opened the 1989 
season looking to improve upon 
last season’s 9-5-2 record. A 2-
0 loss to rival Brandeis Univer­
sity was a step in the wrong di­
rection, but the ingredients 
exist for a very successful sea­
son.
The Tartans will be looking 
to three-year letter winner 
EddiePark to lead them against 
both University Athletic Asso­
ciation and Presidents Athletic
Conference foes. Park was named 
to both the all-UAA and all-PAC 
squads last year and led the team 
with 33 points. He set two school 
records last year, most points and 
most goals in a game, by scoring 
four goals in a victory against 
Grove City.
Rob Schaeffer will be counted 
on to assist Park in scoring. 
Schaeffer was the team’s second- 
leading scorer last season with 28 
points. Anchoring the goal again 
will be Glen Hoogerwerf. Hooger- 
werf was a second-team All-PAC 
pick and had a 1.12 goals against 
ratio.
CMUs main competition will 
come from perennial PAC power 
Bethany College and UAA pre- 
season favorite Emory Univer­
sity. The team also will face its 
traditional rival, the University 
of Pittsburgh, at Pitt Stadium 
on October 11.
Due to the East Campus con- 
struction, the soccer Tartans will 
be forced to play home games at 
two off-campus sites. Mosthome 
games will be played at 
Shadyside Academy, while some 
will be at Sewickley Academy. 
Buses will be available from 
Skibo to take fans to the games.

The Tartan defense seemed to 
hold, stopping two consecutive 
pass plays, then sacking 
Duquesne quarterback Bill 
Marancel on the third, but a face- 
mask penalty against Chris Ba- 
louris on the sack gave the Dukes 
the chance they needed. Three 
plays later Marancel found Dan 
Krebbs in the end zone to make it 
a one point game. A gamble by 
going for the win paid off, with 
Marancel completing another 
pass to Krebbs for the two-point 
conversion, and an 11-10 win.
This week: The Tartans hope 
to turn things around against

rival Washington University. Last

The goal of the cross-country
season is to win the region which 
entitles them to go on to nation­
als. This year there is added diffi­
culty in making it to nationals 
because only the first place team 
at the region may run at nation­
als. In the past, the first two 
teams competed at nationals.

Due to injury, freshman Koni

in the first race of the season, but 
should be running next week.
Following Duquesne’s Butkus 
were sophomore Colleen Barkley 
in eighth place in 20:52 and 
freshman Tracy Howard in tenth 
place.
The team was a bit concerned 
with the difficulty of Robert
Morris’ course, which contains 
several turns and hills. There 
were also wooden steps along the 
course that seemed to slow down 
many runners.
Johnson stated that she was 
pleased with the trails through 
the woods, however the first mile 
was difficult due to the uphill 
path.
The outcome of the first meet of 
the season is always difficult to
predict since most of the women 
have not competed during the 
summer and the ability of the 
freshman is unknown. If their 
victory against Duquesne is an 
indication ofthe rest ofthe season 
the Lady Tartans should have a

¡Tartan Features Editor
Waiant to make a mark on the 
story of Carnegie Mellon? Since its 
nstruction in 1923, the Fence has 
¡rovided many students with an 
ective if momentary spotUght. The 
Fence ranks with Spring Carnival and 
puggy as an enduring and unique 
arnegie Mellon tradition.
Painting the Fence has specific 
'Written rules well-known to the 
asoned veteran. It must be painted 
in its entirety, and only at night, though 
a group can “reserve” the Fence by 
placing members on guard during any 
time of the day.
!¦ However, the task doesn’t stop with 
the actual painting; if a group of 
Painters leaves its handiwork before 
dawn, rivals might come and paint it 
ever with their own messages.
, To date, the layers of paint on the 
*ence span somewhere between three
and seven inches.
But why would otherwise rational 
people take so much trouble to paint the 
Fence? There seem to be several reasons. 
According to PatBeighley of Kappa Delta 
Rho, who has slept under the fence about 
“three or four times,” “It’s such an 
excellent medium for advertising — 
everyone sees it, and you can write 
whatever you want on it. You can express 
yourself freely.” He also says that the 
Fence can be an appropriate outlet for 
graffiti, and concludes that “It’s so much 
funit just has to be done,” probably in the 
spirit of earlier students who built and 
painted the Fence.
The early pioneers of Fence-painting, 
however, were seniors. The Fence, now 
open to all students, was originally 
designated the Senior Fence.
According to the Student Council 
minutes of September 27,1922, the total 
allotment to the construction of the Fence 
was $135; $75 for materials and $60 for 
labor. It was completed for Senior Week
ini 923.
Another “legend” maintains that the 
Fence served as a meeting place between 
female students of Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie College and males of Carnegie 
Tech. Though the University has since 
gone co-ed, the Fence area is still a 
popular meeting place, probably due to 
its fairly central location and its relaxed 
atmosphere.
But time has begun to wear on this 
sixty-six year old monument. Last year, 
a large chunk of Fence broke free from 
the rest. Fixing the Fence has been an 
ongoingprocess, according to Jim Walker 
of Physical Plant. He remembers at least 
two other times in the last eleven years 
that his department has performed 
repairs on the Fence.
The most recent repair called for the 
replacement of the deteriorating end 
section with one of wolmanized lumber, 
which was then anchored into the rest of 
the structure with concrete. Wolmanized 
lumber is lumber which has undergone
chemical treatment to withstand the 
elements; it is often used in the 
construction of decks and fence posts. 
Such lumber should last 30 years 
immersed in water. Walker hopes it will 
last 100 years on the Cut.
Further repair to the Fence, however, 
will be necessary in the future. Walker 
says that he found ants in the wood 
underthemanycoatsofpaint,butassures 
the campus that “We’ll replace it as it 
starts breaking loose.”
One question that plagues many 
students, however, is what happened to 
the section of original Fence that Physical 
Plant removed this summer. Walker 
reports that it is under lock and key for 
Michael Murphy’s office. Murphy, acting 
dean of student affairs, confirms this 
statement, saying that the fate of this 
piece of Carnegie Mellon history will be 
decided this semester, probably by 
Student Senate.
Several options have been proposed, 
the most popular being placing a piece in
Scotland Yard. As Murphy observes, 
however, “There’s probably not enough 
room in Scotland Yard to house the whole 
section,” so what to do with the remaining 
pieces is open to debate.
One suggestion is to make Fence pieces 
coated in polyurethane available to 
students or alumni, possibly at a fee 
earmarked to benefit the University 
Center construction fund, or possibly for 
free.
Whatever the final decision, however, 
the Fence remains an important piece of 
Carnegie Mellon mythology; both 
students and administration recognize 
its importance as a true Camgie Mellon 
tradition, worth the time and money of 
repair and preservation.
What do you think the University should 
do with the piece of Fence sitting in 
Physical Plant ? Fill out the questionaire 
on page L2 and send it in to The Tartan 
for our information poll. We will print 
the results in a future issue.

Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Are you having trouble 
finding a legal parking space 
on or even near campus? Well, 
you're not alone. The beginning 
of a new academic year, coupled 
with the absence of previously- 
available parking spaces in the 
Margaret Morrison lot, has 
enabled another parking 
crutich to hit Carnegie Mellon.
With the completion of the 
East Campus Project slowly 
approaching, the new parking 
garage will hopefully be 
completely operational in the 
near future.
As of today, over half of the 
garage is open. Three hundred 
andninty spaces are currently 
in use, as opposed to the over 
six hundred spaces that will 
be available after construction 
is finished.
Accordingto CMU’s parking 
coordinator, Silvia Austin, the 
new garage will not solve the 
parking crunch that has hit 
campus. With the East 
Campus Project, Carnegie 
Mellon has lost three of its 
parking lots to the new 
construction. The parking 
garage makes up for some of 
the lost spaces, but it won’t 
solve all of the problems.
This year, the Parking Office 
has given parking permits to 
only eight students. Three 
hundred additional students
are waiting for parking on a list 
maintained by the parking office. 
According to Austin, there is no 
way all of these students will get 
the parking they want.
The parking office also has two 
full-time employees who go 
around to the different parking 
lots and write tickets. With 
eighteen parking lots and over 
twenty three hundred parking 
spaces, they usually catch anyone 
who is parked in an illegal 
manner.
Steve Peters, a junior IS major, 
has had a car on campus for a 
couple of months each year. He 
didn’t apply for a permit because 
it costs too much money.
“Parking is incredibly lousy 
when the lots are closed,” says 
Peters, who brought his car to 
campus just so he could have the 
freedom to go anywhere anytime. 
So far, Peters has gotten two 
tickets, both from the Pittsburgh 
police. “It's worth the hassle,” 
Peters says about all of the 
parking problems that he faces 
everyday.
An anonymous senior in the 
physics department, who 
describes parking at Carnegie 
Mellon as “awful," doesn’t have a 
permit because he says it’s 
cheaper to get two or three tickets 
a month than to pay for a parking 
space. The cost of a parking space 
ranges from $24.44 to $65.66 per 
month depending on which 
parking lot the permit is for. He 
has received about eight tickets,
half of which he has paid. As far 
as finding a space goes, he stated 
that “I find sneaky little places all 
the time.”
A graduate student in the 
drama department, who also 
wishes to remain anonymous, has 
a car on campus to commute from 
her off campus apartment to 
classes. She stated that she didn’t 
have a parking permit and 
wouldn’t even try to get one 
because “I don’t have a chance so 
I won’t even try.” For two years 
she has received no parking 
tickets and has had no major 
problems in finding a parking 
space.
For the campus at large, 
however, parking remains a 
problem. On the chart to the right 
is a map detailing non-permit 
parking places within the general 
vicinity of the campus. The 
majority of these spaces are in 
residential areas. In addition to 
these spaces, there are many 
metered parking spaces in the 
Oakland area.
Several streets in the Oakland 
area have no parking on one half 
of the street, while the other side 
is metered or permit only parking.
So if you don't mind a five 
minute walk from your parking 
space to campus, then you 
shouldn'thave any trouble finding 
a legal space to park in. Just refer 
to the chart and double check that 
you are parked legally, and your 
parking problems will be over, if 
only for the time being.

ATTENTION H&SS SENIORS AND OTHERS DOING 
H&SS DOUBLE MAJORS OR MINORS
Imagine that someone offered you $13,000 and a year to study something that has interested 
you for a long time, that excites you a lot, and that would require travel abroad in one or more 
cultures different from your own. Would that interest you, and what would you do?
A IF©flIl(DWsMip can make this possible for you.
The College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University has become one of a 
select group of 55 schools who are eligible to nominate students for Thomas J. Watson Fellowships. 
The Watson Fellowship program seeks to enable college graduates of unusual promise to engage in

STUDENT
SENATE
On behalf of the Student Senate I would like to welcome everyone to campus, especially the members of the Class of’93. I would also like to take this opportunity to 
explain what the Senate does. The Student Senate and the Student Government President make up the Student Government of Carnegie Mellon. The duties of the 
Senate include: allocation of the student activities fee, advocation of student involvement in university decision making, and the resolution of student problems. To 
accomplish these tasks best, the Senate has the following standing committees:
Academic Affairs - This committee deals with all university academic policies and programs. Recent issues include: honor code, academic advising, university 
tenure policies.
Campus Affairs - This committee deals with university auxiliary services, university wide policies, and campus building projects. Recent issues include: 
recycling, extension of health service, and College of Fine Arts ventilation.
Funding and Recognition - This committee deals with the allocation of the Student Activities Fee. Also, F & R determines the status of all student 
organizations, as either funded, non-funded, or service.
Public Relations - This committee deads with the publication of Student Senate events and coordinates Senate involvement in campus events.
Rules - This committee deals with changes in the Student Government Constitution and the Carnegie Mellon Student Handbook. Recent issues include: the 
funding of political groups, the alcohol policy, and dorm storming policies.
In addition to this the Student Senate nominate students to university and faculty committees. As you can see the Student Senate deals with a wide variety of issues 
that effect the whole university. Therefore, I encourage all interested students to become involved in the Student Senate. The Senate meets on Tuesdays at 7:00 pm 
in the Wherrett Room and the Senate office is Room 59 in Skibo. So stop by or give us a call at X 2115. Once again, welcome to Carnegie Mellon and best of luck in the 
upcoming year.

Sorority rush exposes women to the Greek system, builds lasting friendships
By HOWDY EERCE
Tartan Editorin-Chief
Sophomore Laurie Wilkison 
says she sigiid up for this fall’s 
sorority rushor the same reasons 
as most othe rushees.
“I just siged up to meet some 
girls. That’s probably the same 
reason you! get from anybody 
you talk to.:
Wilkison just transferred to 
Carnegie Mllon University from 
Indiana Uriversity. She says she 
isn’t sure whether she will 
actually jon one of CMU’s five 
sororities.
“I don’t mow much about it at 
all,” she siys. “A few girls on the 
hall said they went through it, 
and they <nj oyed it, but they didn’t 
join a buse. That’s the only 
opinion 7ve gotten so far.”
Wilki;on may have more 
experience with sorority rush than 
many Gf her fellow rushees; she 
registered last year for rush at 
Indian*, but dropped out after 
only tW> rounds of parties.
This I week, she says, she’s 
looking forward to experiencing 
rush at a smaller school—a factor 
she hopes will allow her to get to 
knowmore sisters at each party 
instead of being “herded in and 
out” of every house as one of a 
large number of rushees.
If Wilkison has some idea what 
to expert during the four rounds 
of parties being held this week, 
she may be ahead of the game. 
According to Panhel Rush Chair 
Annalisa Ekbladh, sorority rush 
is a structured system designed 
to give every house an equal 
chance of attracting members.
But, says Ekbladh, that 
structure can often seem 
confusing to new rushees. She 
expects rushees to be a little
photo by Stephen Kang
Rush counselor Laura Buccl signs up a rushee at the Activities Fair held Thursday on the Mall. The rush 
counselors have the job of answering rushee questions and escourtingthe rushees to the rush parties. They 
must remain totally impartial, however; they are representatives of Panhel before representatives of their 
particular houses.
nervous and skeptical going into 
thefirst round ofparties tomorrow 
night.
“It is difficult, within a really 
structured time frame, to meet 
the girls and meet them enough 
so you know who they are,” 
Ekbladh says. “But by the end of 
rush, I think there is adequate 
time for everybody to get to know 
each other.”
Ekbladh’s advice for rushees is 
to “relax and let yourself come 
through.” She and other asters 
cite the number of friendships 
formed during rush as cne of 
rush’s greatest benefits; Ekbladh 
feels that those friendships 
continue long after rush ends, 
regardless of which houss the 
rushee chooses to pledge, f she
pledges at all.
“We like to say that even if you 
don’t pledge, rush is a good way to 
meet people. I think that’s 
accurate,” Ekbladh says.
Rush formally started last night 
with an all-Panhellenic social held 
in the Skibo Ballroom. Each 
rushee was introduced to her rush 
counselor — a sorority member 
who serves to counsel and advise 
the rushee, accordingto Ekbladh. 
In addition, none of the rushees 
know which house their rush 
counselor represents, so that they 
aren’t influenced by this factor in 
their choice of houses.
Tomorrow night, every rushee 
will attend a 25-minute theme 
party at each sorority. Friday, the 
rushees will each choose one
sorority to drop; they will then 
attend parties at each of the four 
remaining sororities they’re 
considering. Saturday, the process
is repeated, with rushees 
returning to only three houses.
According to Ekbladh, the 
themes of the first three rounds of 
parties serve as icebreakers. “It 
makes conversation a little 
easier,” she says. In previous 
years, houses have had beach 
parties, roaring ’20s parties, and 
Hard Rock Cafe parties.
To allow rushees to pick up 
invitations for each party, a “post 
office” is set up in Skibo Room 45. 
A rushee must receive an 
invitation from a house to return 
to that house the next night. In 
practice, each house gives every 
rushee an invitation to the second 
round of parties.
On Sunday, each rushee will 
return tohour-long“final parties” 
at only two houses. “The final 
party is where each sorority shows 
[the rushees] about its 
background andhistory,” Ekbladh 
says. Sisters are allowed to give 
rushees gifts during the final 
parties; traditional gifts, 
accordingto Ekbladh, are flowers 
or symbols of the sorority.
Sunday evening, the members 
of each house will meet to generate 
a bid list; meanwhile, rushees will
“preference” two houses. Greek 
Advisor Ron Campana, an alumni 
advisor from each house, and 
Ekbladh will compare the bid lists 
with each rushee’s preference to 
decide which bid each rushee will 
receive.
The rushees will return to 
Morrison’s Sunday night to pick 
up their bids; from there, they 
will go to pledge parties at their 
respective houses.
According to Ekbladh, few 
rushees do not receive bids. In 
fact, she says that only two 
rushees failed to “match” last year. 
Both had put down only one house 
on their preference list, a practice 
known as “suiciding” that 
Ekbladh counsels all rushees not 
to do.
When The Tartan went to press, 
125 women had registered for 
rush, a sign Ekbladh sees as 
optimistic: “I think that we’re 
getting a better reputation on 
campus. At least I hope we are.”
For her part, Wilkison is looking 
forward to rush at Carnegie 
Mellon. “I think it will be a good 
idea for me just to go through the 
different rounds of parties and 
see who I can meet,” she says.

By DAN BIDWA
Tartan Staffwriter
Classes have started, everyone’s 
just starting to get swamped with 
work, and it’s time to figure out 
how to blow off work. The best 
way to blow off work (and money) 
is by buying records, of course. 
(You can blow more money by 
buying CDs, but you risk being 
labeled as a yuppie snot, or just 
an outright idiot. Besides, you’ll 
feel pretty foolish when they self- 
destruct in seven years.)
Where to buy records? Well, the 
best record store in Pittsburgh 
used to be Jim’s Records, at 4526 
Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield, but 
he’s been on a downhill slide ever 
since he started getting CDs. He 
used to have two huge shelves of 
seven inches, as well as a sizeable 
batch of twelve inch wax, but the 
seven inches have been sold, and 
the amount of space devoted to 
vinyl decreases each week as the 
CD area increases. (It’s a self- 
fulfilling prophecy — store own­
ers hear that sales of LPs are 
dropping off, so they decide not to 
carry any more LPs, and, not
.Music Music Music 
In 
Review
surprisingly, they don’t sell any 
more LPs.)
Anyway, Jim’s still has a bunch 
of good wax, as well as the area’s 
best folk and reggae selections 
and a decent selection of fanzines 
and new seven inches. The easi­
est way to get there is by taking 
the CMU shuttle as far as it goes 
on Morewood and then walking 
the rest of the way (make a right 
at the end of Morewood, and then 
a left at Liberty Avenue.)
The other place to do some seri­
ous record shopping is at Eide’s 
Comics and Records. Eide’s 
opened up a Squirrel Hill store 
last year, but the good stuff is still 
atthedowntownstore. (The down­
town store’s general appearance 
is a lot more comfortable as well.) 
Downtown, Eide’s has a really 
huge selection of records that you
may never find any­
where else, both LPs 
and seven inches, as 
well as a bunch of 
used records, CDs, 
cassettes, tee shirts, 
magazines, and gen­
eral rock and roll 
paraphernalia Eide’s 
also has the area’s best metal 
section. In addition to music, 
Eide’s also carries comics and 
books, mostly science fiction and 
fantasy. The only bad part about 
the store is some of the people 
that work there, who can be real 
assholes, but aside from that, it’s 
a cool place to dig through. It’s at 
940 Penn Avenue—take any bus 
downtown and walk.
The Squirrel Hill Eide’s isn’t 
quite as much fun to poke around 
in, partially because ithasn’tbeen 
there for as long and therefore 
hasn’t developed the same atmos­
phere, and partially because it’s 
smaller. Normally, this wouldn’t 
necessarily be a bad thing, but 
the employees can be dicks, and 
the smaller space gets kind of 
oppressive. Still, it’s closer, at 
2713 Murray Avenue — walk up
Forbes to Murray, make a right, 
and keep walking. It’s a hike, but 
walking is the easiest way to get 
there, so just go sometime when 
the rest of Squirrel Hill is open so 
you'll have something to look at.
Besides Jim’s and Eide’s, there 
are a few other good record stores 
in Pittsburgh. For used records, 
Jerry’s Records, at 3710 Forbes
Avenue in Oakland, is the place, 
with way more records than you’ll 
have time to look through in one 
day. Really good and rare things 
appear there often, so repeated 
visits are a good idea. The Collec­
tor’s Twelve Inch is right across 
the street, and is worth at least 
one visit. Record Graveyard is 
closer, above Panther Hollow Inn
on the other side of the bridge, but 
usually doesn’t have quite as 
much good stuff.
National Record Mart and Oasis 
are corporate stooges. Go to a real 
store.

New Group presents Chekov’s Three 
Sisters; premiere of new translation
By MICHAEL SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Pittsburgh’s own New Group 
Theater is preparing for the pro­
duction oiThree Sisters, the Thea­
ter’s finale to a very successful 
seventh season. In fact, due to the 
significant increase in attendance 
throughout the season, Three Sis­
ters has been scheduled for an 
additional week of performances.
Sisters is a comedy written by 
Anton Chekhov and translated 
by Barry Paris. The play displays 
a multitude of emotions as it fol­
lows the lives of the three sisters,
played by Kathleen Donnelly, 
Barbara Meisel and Rosemary 
Mizerak. The director is Martin 
Giles.
Subtly entwined within this tale 
are the forces of what we com­
monly call “ordinary life.” Life 
itself is shown to be a mysterious 
struggle in which, somehow, we 
have all been selected to act as 
necessary participants. Together, 
love and rivalry, adultery, indif­
ference and despair, history and 
dreams, just a bit ofthe eccentric, 
all that is said and all that which 
is left unsaid, progress and the 
power of change are carefully
integrated into this story of three 
sisters and their acquaintances 
in a provincial Russian town.
Paris’ translation receives itsl 
professional premiere with the I 
New Group Theater as Three Sis-1 
ters enters production. The play 8 
will run September 7 through^ 
September 30. Performances £ 
given at the New Group Theater II 
which is located at 5118 Penn || 
Avenue, Bloomfield/Garfield 
Performance times are Thursday. 
Friday and Saturday evenings at|
8. Ticket price is $4.00.
For reservations or for more| 
information, call 361-2488.

Once again the Pittsburgh Play­
house Film Repertory offers a 
month jam-packed with a wide 
variety of entertaining films.
One of the highlights at the 
Playhouse this month is the 
Woody Allen Mini-Festival. It 
began this past Friday and con­
tinues through Thursday. Tonight 
the Playhouse will show Manhat­
tan, a comedy that provides a 
witty view of New York City life­
styles set to the music of Gersh­
win. Rated R, the film will be 
shown at 7 and 9 pm.
Showing on September 6 is 
Stardust Memories', rated R, it 
runs at 7 and 9 pm. Filmed in 
black and white, the film is a slow 
but intriguing look at a 
filmmaker’s world as it begins to 
close in on him.
Finally, Take the Money and 
Run will be shown on September
7. This story about an inept thief 
is rated PG and will run at 7 and 
9 pm.
Another highlight is the Pitts­
burgh premiere of Red Sorghum, 
a drama about a young woman 
whose life struggles parallel the 
political and social turbulence in 
China during the 1930s and 40s, 
when the Japanese invaded and 
occupied China.
Directed by Zhang Yimou, the
film was the winner of the Golden 
Bear at the 1988 Berlin Film 
Festival. Red Sorghum is in 
Mandarin with English subtitles, 
and runs from September 8-21, 
with showings every night at 7 
and 9 pm.
Running from September 22 to 
28 is Vincent: The Life and Death 
of Vincent Van Gogh. This 1989 
release was directed by Paul Cox. 
The film examines the French 
painter’s life as told through his 
letters to his brother Theo and his 
paintings from 1872-1890. The 
film is 99 minutes long and shows 
each night at 7 and 9 pm.
Single evening showings 
include Miss Firecracker on Sep­
tember 9, a film based on Beth 
Henley’s Broadway play about a 
woman who wants to win a 4th of 
July talent contest. Holly Hunter 
stars, a recent Oscar nominee for 
Broadcast News and a CMU 
Drama alumna. The film is rated 
PG and shows at 7:30 and 9:30 
pm.
Dr. Strangelove will be shown 
September 11, starring George C. 
Scott and Peter Sellers. This black 
comedy about The Bomb is often 
considered to be Sellers’ finest 
work. Showings are at 7:30 and 
9:30 pm.
Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? 
will be shown on September 14, 
starring Elizabeth Taylor and 
Richard Burton. Directedby Mike
Nichols, this controversial film 
(based on the play by Edward 
Albee) follows a couple involved 
in an all-night emotional blood­
letting session. The film will show 
at 7:30 and 9:45 pm.
On September 15 the Playhouse 
presents Roadhouse. Patrick 
Swayze fans should enj oy this film 
about a bar bouncer. Directed by 
Rowdy Herrington, Roadhouse is 
rated R and shows at 7:30 and 
9:30 pm.
September 17 brings Willy 
Wonka and the Chocolate Fac­
tory, a must for all ages. Gene 
Wilder stars in a delightful role

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 6 September 1989L9Drive-In queen makes action film
I Joe Bob Goes
For those of you who don’t live 
in Texas, this is the time of year 
when it gets so hot here that little 
pieces of the medulla oblongata 
flake off like dandruff and people 
start making speeches about how 
we need to stamp out these porno 
businesses, or build a new medi­
cal school in Lubbock, or put in a 
bid for the 1996 Olympics. And 
then they argue about it, and one 
of em kills the other one.
For a long time I didn’t know 
why this happened. But a few 
years back they commissioned a 
study called “Suburban Brain 
Damage: How to Recognize It, 
How to Prevent It,” and research­
ers found that swimming pools 
were the prime reason for half the 
crime in major Texas cities.
See, God didn’t intend for people 
in Texas to swim. Even though we 
have about 900 lakes, 899 of em 
were built by the Army Corps of 
Engineers. The only one God built 
is called Caddo Lake, smack dab 
on the Louisiana border, and it’s 
so swampy that if you try to swim 
in it, prehistoric species get lodged 
in your trunks. At the 899 Bull­
dozer Wonder lakes, the water’s 
so mucky that the alligator gar 
population has filed a class action 
I suit against the state. If you touch 
1 the water with your finger before 
I the age of six, you have to have an 
extra 94 vaccinations before you 
can start the first grade.
But then Texas figured out they 
could avoid alligators AND alli- 
1 gator gars if they would build 
r their own swimming pools.
God didn’t put any swimming 
pools here either. God put all the

swimming pools in California. But 
we imported some, and we even 
imported the redwood decks and 
the earth-colored tile in the shape 
of venereal diseases to put around 
the pools. And then people dug up 
their entire backyards and de­
stroyed a bunch of perfectly good 
St. Augustine grass, which is the 
only crop that’ll grow naturally in 
Texas, and they pumped a bunch 
of chlorine in there and they 
painted big maps of Texas on the 
bottom of the pool and then they 
said “Look! Water you can see 
through!” And all the neighbors 
came over to stare, and then they 
wanted pools, too.
So what happens now, about 
this time of year, is people have 
been staring out the window at 
their Texas-style chlorinated 
pools all summer and then look­
ing at one another and saying 
“Honey, it might get cool enough 
today to USE the thing.” And then 
ONE day, usually in late July, the 
temperature will dip down into 
the low 90’s, and the whole family 
will sprint out there carrying 
inflatable Dino the Dinosaurs, and 
they’ll lay their little white-bread 
bods down on the earth-colored 
VD tiles, and then they’ll notice 
that, even though they’ve only 
been out there two minutes, parts 
of their brains are dribbling down
onto the pavement 
and their skin looks 
like pecan waffle.
Fortunately, 
Texas hospitals are 
so used to dealing 
with this problem 
that they have spe­
cial ambulance codes. “We have a 
Richard Pryor on South Elm!“ Or, 
in the case of those who have 
actually baked both feet off their 
bodies, “Pillsbury Doughboy at 
313 Victor Street.” And thanks to 
modem surgical techniques, we 
are now able to save most human 
brains from a full meltdown, and 
all you have is a little permanent 
intelligence loss. And that’s the 
scientific explanation for Texas 
behavior in August.
And speaking of heat, Sybil 
Panning is back after a year’s 
absence from the drive-in screen. 
The former ripaway-bra queen is 
unveiling her new look in LA. 
Bounty, where she not only doesn’t 
rip off her bra, but she doesn’t 
even show any cleavage! This is 
the new gimme-the-machine-gun 
Action Sybil — leather jacket, 
boots, raked blonde curls spray­
ing out from her head like angel- 
hair pasta, and 17,000 rounds of 
ammo. And her target is...
Wings Hauser! Ever since Vice 
Squad, he’s the pure-dee mean­
est guy in the movies. And in this 
one he’s a painter-drug dealer/ 
murderer/mystic who likes to 
perform executions for the amuse­
ment of God. Remember the thing 
he does with the wire coat hang­
ers in Vice Squad? He does some­
thing even MEANER in LA.

The plot is about how a guy

A Clockwork Orange
Based on the Anthony Burgess novel and directed 
by Stanley Kubrick, this film is a must-see. The story 
centers around a young man whose main hobbies are 
beating people up, raping women, and listening to 
classical music. He goes along his merry little way, 
creating chaos all around him, until one day he gets 
caught by the police and is sent to jail.
After spending years in jail, he is given the option 
of participating in a sinister experiment which will 
allow him to be released immediately from jail. After 
he is through with treatment and is released, we 
witness how society gets its revenge on him. An 
excellent movie with an intriguing message and 
striking imagery.

Animal House
Unless you have been on a desertisland for the last 
ten years or so, you probably have seen this movie. To 
refresh your memory, the film is mostly about a 
fraternity and the wild parties they have on campus. 
One or two of the houses get out of hand, so the dean 
decides to kick them off campus. The brothers, in 
turn, decide to get even. Starring toga parties, keg 
parties, picking up women, stealing exams, 
sabotaging Homecoming, food fights, the famous 
“angel and devil” scene, putting a horse in the dean’s 
office, great music, and John Belushi. Come and find 
out how college was really meant to be.
At 6, 8, 10, 12. Rated R
Saturday, September 9 
Three Fugitives
Take the worst parts of Three Men and A Baby and 
Midnight Run and this is what you get. Martin Short 
is a down and out guy who unsuccessfully tries to rob 
banks for a living. Nick Nolte is an ex-con who just 
happens to run into Short while he’s fudging up a 
bank robbery. Somehow a baby gets thrown into the 
picture and before you know it they are all on the run. 
View with extreme caution.
At 6, 8,10,12. Rated PG
Sunday, September 10 
Sleeper
Continuing with the Sunday AB Woody Allen 
festival, Sleeper is probably Allen’s strangest movie. 
Allen plays Miles Monroe, a simple man who ran the 
Happy Carrot Health Food Store in Greenwich 
Village, went to St. Vincent’s Hospital for a minor 
operation, and woke up 200 years in the future. 
America is a police state, people have sex in a 
machine called the orgasmatron, and the 
underground wants Allen because he is the only 
person alive without an identification number. The 
plot gets even stranger as Allen is recruited to 
assassinate the nation’s dictator, known as The 
Leader, whom Allen discovers is nothing more than 
adisembodied nose. Great entertainment for a boring 
Sunday night.

In what will surely be the easiest test of your intellect this term, Apple invites you to try winning a free Apple* Macintosh® Plus personal computer merely by finding it in this drawing. 
We’ll even give you a hint: It’s not the table, the lamp, or the chair. Now you’re on your own. 
To register, look for contest details where Macintosh computers are sold on your campus. Oh, all right, we’ll give you a hint for that, too: Look at the bottom of this ad. But do it really, really fast. Because only one Macintosh is being given away on this campus, and it’s going to happen soon. Soon, as in right away Pronto. Quick-like. But hey, you can take a hint.éSomebody’s going to win a fee Macintosh.
Enter August 28th-September 15th
