Title IX, a section of the 
1972 Education Amendments, 
mandates that all educational 
institutions receiving federal 
funds treat male and female 
students equally. Although 
Title IX covers all aspects of 
higher education — every-
thing from coursework to ath-
letics — the national focus has 
recently shifted to Title IX in 
the context of sexual assault 
and relationship violence.
To that end, Carnegie Mel-
lon recently established the Of-
?ce of Title IX Initiatives. The 
goal of the Of?ce of Title IX Ini-
tiatives, according to part-time 
Interim Director of the of?ce 
and Title IX Coordinator Holly 
Hippensteel, is “gender equity 
broadly de?ned.”
As part-time interim direc-
tor, Hippensteel hopes to “re-
ally launch the of?ce [and] 
make it a resource that people 
are aware of around campus,” 
she told The Tartan. “We want 
to take a look at some existing 
structures that are currently 
there — how do we want to 
tweak those; how do we want 
to centralize that?”
The newly formed Of?ce 
has a space in West Wing 
102, where Hippensteel sits 
with alumna Jamie Edwards 
(DC ’07), assistant director of 
Title IX initiatives. Edwards 
graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon with a bachelor’s de-
gree in political science and 
history & public policy, and 
previously practiced law re-
lated to domestic violence 
and abuse in Pittsburgh and 
New Jersey.
The search is currently un-
derway for a full-time director 
of the new of?ce; although 
the university has not yet es-
tablished a timeline for the 
search, Hippensteel will hold 
the position part-time for a 
year. Hippensteel also works 
under the Department of Stu-
dent Affairs as a housefellow 
and assistant dean of Student 
Affairs.
The Of?ce of Title IX Ini-
tiatives is part of an ongoing 
?ght against sexual assault 
and relationship violence on 
campus, spurred by a lawsuit 
brought against the university 
by the American Civil Liber-
ties Union (ACLU) in Decem-
ber 2013 and the subsequent 
investigation of the univer-
sity by the U.S. Department 
University establishes new Of?ce of Title IX Initiatives

With the recent reopening 
of the Jared L. Cohon Univer-
sity Center’s (CUC) revamped 
athletics facilities comes 
many overdue state-of-the-art 
changes. The changes include 
drastically improved locker 
rooms, new pool ventilation, 
and more secure facilities, to 
name just a few. However, one 
change may not be as pleasant 
for many longtime patrons: 
the new towel purchasing and 
washing system. 
Previously, the CUC pro-
vided all guests with a free 
towel service that allowed 
for a carefree trip to the gym: 
In theory, one simply had to 
grab a fresh towel at the start 
of a workout, and toss it down 
the laundry chute upon con-
clusion. In actuality, many 
towels were being borrowed 
and never returned. 
Upon the reopening of the 
CUC, the towel service was 
discontinued, and as of Oct. 
1, patrons will be able to pur-
chase a towel for the year for 
a $25 fee, which can then be 
turned in for washing. In ad-
dition, the new towels will be 
larger and of much nicer qual-
ity than the old ones. 
When asked about the 
new changes, Assistant Direc-
tor of Athletics Sara Gaunter 
explained, “When we closed 
the facility in March, the ath-
letics administration — as 
we always do — and we de-
cided to implement the new 
service. Previously we were 
losing 12 to 15 dozen towels 
per month, which was not 
an ef?cient use of resources 
from an operations stand-
point. This inef?cient system 
had been running for at least 
the eleven years that I’ve been 
here.” Gaunter went on to tell 
The Tartan that the money 
being saved on towels will be 
used elsewhere in the recre-
ation department, for things

Driving past Bakery square on 
the way to Target, Carnegie Mel-
lon Students can spot a new con-
struction on Penn avenue. 
With Google’s Bakery 
Square campus ?anking 
either side now, it is hard 
to not notice the growth 
that Pittburgh is experi-
encing. Carnegie Mellon 
has long been a home 
to some of the bright-
est minds in computer 
science, so it should not 
come as a surprise that a 
corporation which prides 
itself in hiring the best 
and the brightest situates itself so 
close to a campus with this repu-
tation.
Google began its work in Pitts-
burgh in 2006 with a mere two 
engineers, according to its web-
site. After ?ve years, the Fortune 
500 company grew to the point 
where the move to its current 
location was the most logical 
decision. Now with an of?ce 
population greater “than the 
number of Spartans at Ther-
mopylae,” or in other words, 
300, expansion seems the logical 
step for developers in the area.
That is exactly the opportu-
nity the company Walnut Capital 
has invested in. Self-described on 
its website as “one of Pittsburgh’s 
largest and 
fastest grow-
ing real estate 
management, 
development 
and brokerage 
companies,” 
Walnut Cap-
ital further 
bolsters its 
growth with 
the Bak-
ery Square 
expansion currently under way.
Situated on Walnut street — a 
cultural and commercial bastion 
of Shadyside — Walnut Capital 
?nds itself near ?ourishing com-
panies like Duolingo, and those 
that are well established and in-
ternationally recognizable, like 
Rolex. With this cultural position, 
it is not surprising that Walnut 
Capital would invest in diversi-
fying an area by a company that 
prides itself in diversity: Google.
Diversity is exactly what Bak-
ery Square has. Walnut Capital’s 
own website lists the demo-
graphics of Bakery Square and 
its surrounding areas: just under 
338,000 residents live within a 
?ve mile radius of Google’s Bakery 
Square location. Bakery Square is 
a predominantly commercial real 
estate location, and for potential 
buyers, the client base is large. 
In 2010, “Over $131,700,000.00 
[were] spent on dining out & over 
$138,059,381.00 [were] spent 
on apparel service purchases in 
the neighboring communities,” 
according to Walnut Capital’s 
website.
Looking around the area, it 
should be clear that it is undergo-
ing gentri?cation. With popular 
student restaurant destinations 
such as Noodlehead just up the 
street and consumer locations 
like Home Depot and Target on 
its peripheries, Bakery Square 
stands as an icon to Pittsburgh’s 
technological growth. Accord-
ing to Walnut Capital’s statistics, 
“14.2 percent of Households [in 
the area] have a net worth of over 
$500,000.00,” and over 250,000 
employees work within ?ve miles 
of the site. Google acknowledges 
its reasoning for moving to the 
Bakery Square location in its 
online description of the Pitts-
burgh of?ces. The webpage says, 
“We have an especially deep re-
lationship with Carnegie Mellon 
(CMU), co-hosting seminars with 
the university, running shuttle 
buses to CMU for Googlers teach-
ing or participating in events on 
campus and hosting CMU stu-
dents in our of?ce a couple of 
times a month.”
With an expansion of the al-
ready large campus — housed in 
an old Nabisco factory, and in-
cluding a Kennywood roller coast-
er replica — Google and Carnegie 
Mellon can expect to positively 
develop their symbiotic intellec-
tual relationship. Carnegie Mel-
lon has continued to become more 
relevant in the modern techno-
logical age, and the school’s name 
can be heard on the radio and 
seen on the news nearly weekly. 
With Google’s campus so close, 
both the school and 
the company will 
bene?t from each 
other’s intellectual 
nourishment and 
ability to recruit 
pure talent.

Uber gives $5.5 million donation to CMU
CMU announces inaugural presidential scholarship and fellowship recipients
Last week, University 
President Subra Suresh an-
nounced the inaugural class 
of presidential scholarship 
and fellowship recipients. 
The scholarship and fellow-
ship recipients include 90 
undergraduate and 55 grad-
uate students, respectively, 
spread across Carnegie Mel-
lon’s seven colleges and 
schools.
The program, which 
Suresh began in 2014, is 
meant to attract and retain 
top talent to the university. 
Presidential scholarships 
give undergraduate students 
partial support for tuition 
and fees, while presidential 
fellowships give graduate 
students ?nancial security 
that allows them to focus on 
their research.
“This program addresses 
one of the most pressing 
challenges for CMU as we 
compete globally for the best 
students as well as attract 
and retain the faculty who 
mentor them,” Suresh said in 
a university press release.
The full list of scholars 
and fellows and more infor-
mation about the program 
is available online at http://

VIENNA — Last Wednesday, 
Jean-Claude Juncker, the 
president of the European 
Commission, proposed a 
plan to begin making a dent 
in the massive migrant prob-
lems that have been mak-
ing international headlines 
throughout the past month. 
Juncker called for each of 
the member countries to 
open their borders for a por-
tion of 160,000 immigrants. 
The plan was met with 
significant opposition from 
countries that would be ex-
pected to welcome a quota 
of refugees from Africa or 
the Middle East. In the past, 
the European Union has 
failed to agree to terms that 
give a quota for migrants. 
However, with the rise of 
international awareness of 
the problem and a stronger 
push for reform, a search for 
a compromise will continue. 
Germany announced on 
Sunday that the country 
had declared a nationwide 
border state of emergency. 
Interior minister Thomas de 
Mazière stated that the deci-
sion was “desperately neces-
sary” for the integrity of the 
German nation.

WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, 
U.S. president Barack Obama’s 
Iranian Nuclear Deal passed 
in Congress with 41 votes. The 
deal will now go to the Sen-
ate, where it is unclear what 
the fate of the deal will be and 
how Democrats will strategize 
to pass it.

SACRAMENTO — On 
Wednesday, the California 
state assembly passed a bill to 
allow terminally ill residents 
to ask their physicians to ad-
minister life-ending drugs. 
California Governor Jerry 
Brown will have the ?nal say 
on the bill. California has the 
opportunity to join Oregon, 
Washington, Montana, and 
Vermont in growing assisted 
suicide legislation, which 
is modeled after Oregon’s 
right-to-die law. This issue, 
which has been contested in 
California for nearly a quarter 
of a century, gained notoriety 
last year when brain cancer-
stricken Brittany Maynard 
moved to Oregon from Cali-
fornia to end her life.

Continuing the relation-
ship established earlier this 
year, Uber donated $5.5 mil-
lion to Carnegie Mellon last 
week. The gift will be used 
to hire a new faculty chair 
and three new fellowships in 
robotics.
“CMU’s research in com-
puter science and robotics 
has been groundbreaking 
and has made self-driving 
cars possible,” Uber CEO Tra-
vis Kalanick said in a univer-
sity press release. “While it’s 
still early days in our part-
nership, we’re excited about 
the potential to improve 
transportation — from safer 
cars to smarter cities — and 
pumped to be part of Pitts-
burgh’s growing innovation 
ecosystem.”
Uber and Carnegie Mel-
lon partnered in February, 
working together to create 
self-driving vehicles as Uber 
established a new research 
center in Pittsburgh. The 
partnership also includes 
additional investment in the 
university’s National Robot-
ics Engineering Center and 
surrounding technologies.
“Academia-industry part-
nerships play an important 
role in promoting our mutual 
missions of technological 
innovation and developing 
outstanding talent at all lev-
els,” said Carnegie Mellon 
President Subra Suresh in the 
press release. “We are grate-
ful for Uber’s support for the 
intellectual work at the heart 
of this activity.”

Carnegie Mellon Student 
Government is all over social 
media. The Facebook statuses 
showed up last week, pepper-
ing timelines in the Carnegie 
Mellon network with infor-
mation about the Undergrad-
uate Student Senate and its 
various subcommittees.
The Undergraduate Stu-
dent Senate is made up of 37 
voting members, and each 
one of them is responsible 
for not only representing the 
students from their academic 
college, but for joining one 
of six committees within the 
body. The committees —Aca-
demic Affairs, Business Af-
fairs, Campus Life, Communi-
cations, Finance, and Internal 
Development — are all a part 
of the larger mission of Sen-
ate: to improve the lives of 
students at Carnegie Mellon 
and the campus community 
as a whole, according to se-
nior social and decision sci-
ences major and Senate chair 
Julia Eddy. The committees 
are headed by senators who 
have been elected by their 
peers.
The heads of each commit-
tee are a part of the Executive 
Committee of Senate, which 
meets weekly to check in on 
the progress that each com-
mittee is making. While some 
of the committees overlap in 
their goals and projects, they 
all have a set of objectives that 
they aim to achieve within the 
semester and for longer term.
As the subcommittees kick 
off their year, most are work-
ing on projects that all serve 
one common purpose: mak-
ing life at Carnegie Mellon 
easier for the students who 
undertake it.
Campus Life
The Campus Life Commit-
tee is headed by junior sta-
tistics major Kruti Koppolu. 
“The goal of the [campus life] 
committee is to help students 
reach into the Pittsburgh 
community and get out of the 
Carnegie Mellon bubble,” said 
Koppolu. “We want them to 
enrich their CMU experience 
that way.”
Campus Life’s agenda fo-
cuses on elements of student 
life, such as mental health, 
housing, dining, and school 
spirit. The Campus Life com-
mittee was responsible for 
putting together the Strip 
District Crawl of January last 
year, an event that was such 
a huge success that they are 
planning to host a second it-
eration early next semester.
“Our approach to campus 
life is three tiered. We fo-
cus ?rst on how campus life 
impacts students, then how 
it impacts the campus as a 
whole, and ?nally, how we 
can reach out to Pittsburgh 
and engage with the commu-
nity here,” Koppolu said.
Along with the Strip Dis-
trict Crawl, Campus Life will 
be organizing a trip Down-
town to participate in Light 
Up Night, Pittsburgh’s cel-
ebration of the holiday season 
and a school spirit event dur-
ing Cèilidh weekend.
Overall, Koppolu said, 
the goal of the committee is 
to bridge divisions of school, 
wise and ethnicity by focusing 
on events that highlight Carn-
egie Mellon’s diversity. “Stu-
dents will come out to these 
events, meet new people, and 
?nd out more about CMU. 
Even if you’re a senior, there’s 
always something new to 
learn and getting involved on 
campus is a great way to help 
out. We want to make people 
aware that what they’re put-
ting into CMU will come back 
to them,” she said.
Academic Affairs
Chaired by sophomore 
computer science major Eric 
Zhu, the Academic Affairs 
Committee works to improve 
the academic aspect of life 
at Carnegie Mellon. One of 
their primary initiatives that 
will be launched this semester 
is the faculty-student lunch 
program, which provides free 
lunches to students and facul-
ty to encourage conversation 
and engagement.
The committee also fo-
cuses on how to hone in on 
the academic parts of campus 
life that may cause stress and 
brainstorms ways to decrease 
it. Zhu said that the commit-
tee has a few ideas for new 
projects and that they will 
continue to work on past ini-
tiatives to check in that they 
are still effective. Such efforts 
include mental health syl-
labus blurbs, professor talks, 
the Academic Relationships 
Code, and Student Spotlights.
Communications
The Communications 
Committee’s primary role, ac-
cording to junior economics 
and statistics double major 
and committee chair Srishti 
Jain, is to bridge the gap that 
exists between the student 
population and Senate. “Our 
goal is to make the student 
body aware of what we’re 
working on, how they can get 
involved, and also what ideas 
they have that we can crowd-
source from them and act on,” 
Jain said.
The committee is responsi-
ble for publicizing efforts and 
initiatives, such as the faculty-
student lunch program, for 
which they created designs, 
posters, and a website. Essen-
tially, it serves as the liaisons 
between the Senate and the 
students that Senate serves.
“Sometimes, Senate gets 
caught up working on all of 
the projects that they under-
take and forgets to tell stu-
dents what we’re doing for 
them. We work to make stu-
dents aware of what Senate 
can offer to them,” Jain said. 
They are working on social 
media updates, website refur-
bishment, and a plan for Sen-
ate week to that end.
“We just want to remind 
people that we exist and that 
we’re doing things,” Jain said. 
“Otherwise, what’s the point 
of all of the work that we do?”
Senate plans for fall semester
of Education’s Of?ce for Civil 
Rights (OCR).
Last semester, the OCR 
held a series of roundtables 
on Carnegie Mellon’s campus 
as part of the investigation. 
After the OCR’s roundtables, 
the Of?ce of Student Affairs 
held its own series of round-
table discussions, arranged 
by Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno. The round-
tables, targeted toward varied 
demographic groups in the 
university community, asked 
students how the university 
can best educate students and 
the surrounding community 
on the issues of sexual assault 
and relationship violence.
The university is also in 
the process of updating its 
Policy Against Sexual Ha-
rassment and Sexual Assault, 
and looking at the results of 
last semester’s survey on sex-
ual assault and relationship 
violence. The results of the 
survey, Casalegno wrote in an 
email to the student body, will 
be available later this fall.
The Of?ce of Title IX Ini-
tiatives is in charge of much 
of the sexual assault and rela-
tionship violence prevention 
training on campus — in-
cluding that given to resident 
assistants — community 
assistants, and members of 
Orientation staff. The Of?ce 
is working closely with Coor-
dinator of Gender Programs 
and Sexual Violence Preven-
tion Jess Klein, the Survivor 
Support Network (SSN), and 
student groups such as Got 
Consent? and Student Senate 
to increase outreach to and 
coordinate education for the 
university community about 
sexual assault and relation-
ship violence prevention.
“We have all these func-
tions and roles, like preven-
tion, education, support, and 
response,” Hippensteel said, 
“But there wasn’t a central of-
?ce that was really coordinat-
ing or facilitating the effort. 
There were good people do-
ing good work in lots of dif-
ferent pockets, but it wasn’t 
necessarily coordinated all 
out of one spot.
“I think it’s really impor-
tant to keep people aware, 
and keep it on people’s 
minds,” Hippensteel said. 
“And I think the more the 
community is aware of what’s 
happening, and the more that 
they know this is something 
for us all to be committed to, 
the better off we are.”
Students can reach out to 
the Of?ce for Title IX Initia-
tives by email at tix@andrew.

like hiring new instructors 
and purchasing new equip-
ment.
While there are many 
upsides to the new system, 
frequent CUC recreational 
swimmer and Professor of 
English Kristina Straub told 
The Tartan via email, “It’s 
hard for the university to 
do anything right on this 
one. People used to com-
plain all the time about 
how tiny and thin the tow-
els were; it’s amazing to me 
that anyone would want to 
steal one.”
Straub also admitted 
that while she herself is not 
negatively affected by the 
new system, families that 
bring their children to the 
pool for lessons might be. 
“It’s one thing to organize a 
towel for yourself, another 
to organize towels for a 
whole family,” she said. 
In addition, English in-
structor David Cerniglia 
noted the understated ef-
fect the policy will have “It 
seems unfair that they’re 
asking undergraduates 
who are already spending a 
lot of money to be here — 
on tuition, books, and food 
— to spend more money 
to rent a towel, especially 
when they’re trying to do 
something positive like ex-
ercise. We should be mak-
ing that easier.” 
On top of the economic 
advantages created by the 
new system, the school will 
be practicing more environ-
mentally conscious wash-
ing methods, due to the 
diminished amount of wa-
ter and laundry detergent 
needed to wash the towels. 
As parts of the country are 
ailing due to drought, de-
creasing laundry loads can 
only be a positive; the typi-
cal washing machine uses 
around forty gallons of wa-
ter per load. 
While Straub and Cerni-
glia bring up the inconve-
nient aspects of the new 
system, Gautner provides 
the counterargument. Yet 
only time will tell which ar-
guments — in conjunction 
with the improved envi-
ronmental footprint — will 
outweigh the others.

Middle Class continues to bene?t under Obama
DJAMENO NTOWE-FANKAM
Junior Staffwriter 
Amid the upcoming election sea-
son, where both politicians and “Av-
erage Joes” have focused their ener-
gy, President Obama has continued 
to battle against the largely Repub-
lican House of Representatives for 
the bene?t of Middle America. Last 
week, Obama issued an executive 
order ensuring that federal contrac-
tors offer a certain number of paid 
sick days.
The American federal govern-
ment has historically followed the 
mantra of trickle-down economics. 
It often utilizes this as an explana-
tion for pushing policies that mini-
mally interfere with everyday life. 
What politicians fail to realize is that 
these policies only have long-term 
bene?ts for a small percentage of 
the population.
For example: If the income tax is 
lowered, another tax will probably 
have to be raised. These are poli-
cies that give the appearance of the 
government working for the general 
welfare, but in actuality they show 
how stagnant America is as a nation.
Despite this lack of progress, 
America is changing for the better. 
Although Obama’s executive order 
will only apply to about 300,000 
individuals, it shows a shift toward 
targeting the right demographic and 
within the right time frame. The 
policies being enacted are moving 
away from a “free market,” in which 
oligarchs reign, and into a system in 
which people are starting to receive 
the assistance they need to move 
themselves up in society.
Under the Obama administra-
tion, new policies have allowed 
easier access to quality education, 
the growth of small businesses, and 
a plethora of other developing op-
portunities. The key to long-term 
bene?ts for the average American 
lifestyle is planning for the future. 
There is only a certain level of in?u-
ence any president can offer toward 
this goal. Therefore, it is the task of 
Congress to move away from their 
old policies and place the good of 
the nation over the good of their 
constituents.
A quote very pertinent to Amer-
ica’s political system is: “If you are 
not moving forward, you are moving 
backward.” During this upcoming 
presidential election, we will hope-
fully see an individual rise up and 
hold Congress more accountable for 
their lack of action in terms of pro-
gressing of America.
America used to be a superpower 
with every other country envious of 
its success. Eventually, America got 
complacent with where it was as a 
nation, giving other countries the 
opportunity to rise to and even sur-
pass its level. 
In essence, an unwillingness to 
change and progress is what has 
caused America to “move back-
ward.” With Obama’s executive 
order, the United States has ?nally 
started to move back to a competi-
tive level.

Sesame Street marries HBO, moves to “Capitalism Road”
CMU makes more progress with new Title IX Of?ce 
Alumna’s startup shows how to bene?t from CMU

“Under the Obama administration, new 
policies have allowed easier access to 
quality education, the growth of small 
businesses, and a plethora of other 
developing opportunities.” 
If you’re planning a trip to Sesame 
Street, you might want to double 
check the address. Last month, 
Sesame Workshop — the nonpro?t 
that has been producing the beloved 
children’s educational television 
program since 1969 — announced a 
new partnership with HBO.
When people hear “HBO,” they 
don’t usually think of brightly-col-
ored puppets and learning the al-
phabet. Nonetheless, starting next 
season, Sesame Street will ?nd a new 
home on the premium cable chan-
nel and its accompanying streaming 
service. It will also continue airing 
new episodes on PBS, but only after 
a nine-month wait period.
According to Sesame Workshop 
CEO Jeffrey D. Dunn in USA Today, 
the deal “provides Sesame Workshop 
with the critical funding it needs to 
be able to continue production of 
Sesame Street and secure its non-
pro?t mission of helping kids grow 
smarter, stronger and kinder; it gives 
HBO exclusive pay cable and SVOD 
access to the nation’s most important 
and historic educational program-
ming; and it allows Sesame Street 
to continue to air on PBS and reach 
all children, as it has for the past 45 
years.”
The massive funding and produc-
tion power HBO packs will mean that 
Sesame Street can produce twice its 
usual number of episodes, as well as 
a spin-off program and a brand new 
series. In turn, HBO gets its hands 
on one of the longest-running and 
most celebrated children’s shows of 
all time. On a practical level, the deal 
seems like a win-win for all parties.
However, the ideology behind 
the change leaves a lot to be desired. 
Sesame Street was created as an all-
access program for the bene?t of 
low-income families, who have a 
more dif?cult time providing their 
children with a quality formal edu-
cation. At $15 a month, HBO access 
would strain the budgets of this orig-
inal audience.
Even though PBS will air the epi-
sodes eventually, privileged children 
now have ?rst dibs, while less advan-
taged children must wait for their 
leftovers. The new paywall will en-
sure that the program is never again 
equal access across class lines.
Sesame Workshop has sacri?ced 
its principles in favor of the alluring 
glow of capitalism. Sesame Street has 
sold out, and while no one can be 
reasonably surprised, it still leaves a 
bitter taste in the mouth.
After a Title IX complaint in 2013, 
Carnegie Mellon University has been 
?ghting an uphill battle toward mak-
ing the school a safe and healthy en-
vironment in which to discuss gen-
der, sexuality, and equality.
The latest advancement in this 
ongoing campaign is the opening of 
a new of?ce called the Of?ce of Title 
IX Initiatives. 
The of?ce will work to de?ne 
gender equity at Carnegie Mellon, 
according to The Tartan’s interview 
with part-time Interim Director of 
the of?ce and Title IX Coordinator 
Holly Hippensteel.
According to its website, “The 
Of?ce of Title IX Initiatives is dedi-
cated to promoting gender equity at 
Carnegie Mellon University, which 
includes coordinating the Univer-
sity’s efforts to prevent and effec-
tively respond to all forms of sexual 
misconduct impacting community 
members, including sexual assault, 
sexual harassment, dating and do-
mestic violence, and stalking.”
The university has made tremen-
dous strides since the 2013 lawsuit, 
and efforts to that end should be 
lauded. 
The Tartan is proud of the steps 
that the university has taken, and 
the opening of the Of?ce of Title IX 
Initiatives is no exception. This of-
?ce is a key part of the learning pro-
cess — for both the university and its 
students — on what gender equity 
means at a modern day university, 
especially one as forward-thinking 
as Carnegie Mellon.
The real test, however, will come 
during the course of its ?rst year as 
the Of?ce works to spread the word 
about its creation and mission on 
campus. 
The Tartan hopes that the Of?ce 
will engage students and community 
members in meaningful conversa-
tions regarding gender equity and 
how it can be improved on campus.
This summer, the “research-based 
social innovation challenge” UpPrize 
announced that one recipient of 
their $200,000 runner-up prize was 
Marinus Analytics, a startup founded 
by Carnegie Mellon alumna Emily 
Kennedy (DC ‘12).
Marinus uses a software called 
Traf?c Jam to mine information 
online and ?nd patterns which aid 
in the detection and prosecution 
of sex traf?ckers. Currently more 
than 75 law enforcement agencies 
have employed the software, and it 
has helped to rescue 120 victims of 
traf?cking.
The project began as Kennedy’s 
senior honors thesis. She took her 
passion for ?nding a solution to hu-
man traf?cking to the Auton Lab 
in the Robotics Institute, which 
deals primarily with statistical data 
mining. Researchers there cre-
ate software to sift through large 
amounts of data, ?nd patterns, and 
implement real world solutions. 
In Kennedy’s case, they helped 
track advertisements for escorts and 
connected the perpetrators using 
information in them, such as phone 
numbers and locations.
This kind of interdisciplinary co-
operation is an underutilized bene?t 
of attending an advanced research 
institution like Carnegie Mellon. The 
typical Tartan experience tends not 
to extend beyond college boundar-
ies, except perhaps to satisfy unit re-
quirements. 
The university has so many re-
sources to offer us in terms of lab 
space, funding, networking, and 
extremely talented professors and 
peers. We only have access to them 
for four short years. It’s important to 
take advantage of every opportunity 
Carnegie Mellon can offer, not just 
within your own major or college.
Not only do these resources 
give us a once-in-a-lifetime chance 
to grow as students and individu-
als, they enable us to make lasting 
change in the world. Kennedy’s proj-
ect started as a personal passion. Be-
cause she reached out and took ad-
vantage of the university’s potential, 
it grew into a venture that is saving 
people’s lives. 
Now with their new funding, Ma-
rinus has the potential to expand 
into counterfeit traf?cking and ter-
rorism monitoring. 
Students should better acquaint 
themselves with the interdisciplin-
ary resources around them to better 
achieve their goals.

Corporate dollars beat student interest too often at CMU
Eunice Oh/Art Editor
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
Two weeks ago, Carnegie Mellon 
announced a $35 million dollar do-
nation from Tata Consultancy Servic-
es (TCS), a tech services ?rm based 
in Mumbai, India. 
The gift is the ?fth-largest in the 
university’s history, the largest do-
nation from outside of the United 
States, and the largest gift that the 
university has ever received from a 
corporation.
Securing funds and donations 
for Carnegie Mellon has been one of 
University President Subra Suresh’s 
most prominent agenda items since 
he took of?ce in November of 2013. 
Suresh has procured deals and gifts 
from a variety of sources, including 
companies like ridesharing company 
Uber — a ?ve-year-old company al-
ready worth more than $50 billion 
— and Legendary Entertainment, a 
production company founded and 
chaired by Carnegie Mellon trustee 
Thomas Tull.
Many of these donations are pro-
viding funding for the upcoming Tep-
per Quadrangle, an ongoing project 
that will turn what is now the More-
wood Gardens Parking Lot into a 
brand-new space for university-wide 
learning and collaboration. The proj-
ect was kicked off by a $67 million 
donation from David Tepper (GSIA 
’82), announced the same day as Dr. 
Suresh’s inauguration ceremony.
All of these donations are good 
for Carnegie Mellon’s national and 
international reputation, gradu-
ally bringing it closer to Ivy League 
schools like Yale University and Har-
vard University, the latter of which 
received a $400 million donation this 
summer — its largest ever — from 
money manager John Paulson. More 
money is rarely a bad thing: Carnegie 
Mellon, like many U.S. institutions of 
higher education in recent years, is 
chronically underfunded.
Many of the gifts that Carnegie 
Mellon has received since Suresh 
took of?ce, however, have come from 
?nancially powerful corporations 
built on ethically shaky foundations. 
TCS, for example, has recently come 
under ?re for exploiting U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor policies to replace U.S. 
workers with foreign-born employees 
on temporary H-1B visas.
While this is a nuanced and con-
tentious issue, TCS is playing into a 
?awed system by exploiting foreign-
born workers — many of them from 
India — as part of lucrative deals 
with American companies, who lay 
off thousands of American employ-
ees so that they can be replaced with 
relatively low-wage foreign workers. 
The recently laid-off employees 
are often forced to train their replace-
ments, who in turn are underpaid 
and overworked. The system bene?ts 
no one but the companies that engi-
neer the new contracts — companies 
like TCS.
Likewise, Uber has made a name 
for itself in its short history by strong-
arming local and national govern-
ments to assert its dominance. 
Whether or not you support the so-
called “sharing economy,” it’s unde-
niable that Uber’s business practices 
have been questionable at best.
Although Uber was of?cially le-
galized in Pittsburgh six months ago, 
the company had continued to op-
erate after a cease-and-desist order 
from the city’s Department of Trans-
portation. Uber has also aggressively 
infringed upon the business of its 
competitor, Lyft, and has recently 
been embroiled in a controversy after 
being faced with a class-action law-
suit from its drivers over their status 
as contractors, not employees.
It should have come as no sur-
prise, then, when Uber immediately 
poached around 40 of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s top roboticists from the National 
Robotics Engineering Center (NREC) 
after entering into a partnership with 
the university in February, intended 
to produce research on self-driving 
vehicles. Last week, Uber announced 
a $5.5 million donation to the univer-
sity, which many see as belated com-
pensation for the brain drain caused 
by the partnership.
Although the Uber-Carnegie Mel-
lon partnership was ostensibly for 
the purpose of furthering research 
on autonomous vehicles, it some-
times feels like even the architects of 
the deal themselves aren’t sure what 
the terms are.
Carnegie Mellon has marketed 
the recent partnership with TCS as 
an opportunity for students to work 
with the internationally known tech 
company and create lasting impact. 
“As global leaders, Carnegie Mellon 
and TCS have the intellectual power, 
creativity, institutional nimbleness, 
and global reach to capitalize on new 
opportunities and have a lasting im-
pact on society and industry through 
cutting-edge digital research and a 
long-term commitment to educa-
tion,” TCS CEO and Managing Direc-
tor Natarajan Chandrasekaran said 
in a university press release on the 
subject.
Still, it’s hard to see how the part-
nership will directly bene?t students. 
The university’s lack of ?scal trans-
parency makes it dif?cult to follow 
the money, and even more dif?cult to 
see how these donations improve the 
lives of Carnegie Mellon students. 
Suresh said, for example, at the uni-
versity event announcing the dona-
tion, that the money will go toward 
the expansion of the Forbes Avenue 
“innovation corridor,” part of the 
university’s planned expansion that 
remains wrapped in abstraction and 
hyperbole.
Although some of the money is 
going toward more immediate goals, 
like the endowment of presidential 
scholarships and building the bud-
ding new facilities of the Tepper 
Quadrangle, few of these projects 
have immediate, tangible impacts on 
student life. 
Often, Carnegie Mellon focuses 
more using high-minded, empty 
rhetoric to please corporate sponsors 
than focusing on the heart of the uni-
versity — its students. The university 
is also facing the problems inherent 
in corporate-academic partnerships 
and the clashing ideologies of free 
market-driven, globalized compa-
nies and the (theoretically) purely 
research-driven university. 
Can anyone really blame Uber, for 
example, for acting in its own best 
interest by offering higher salaries 
to Carnegie Mellon roboticists, many 
of whom are international leaders 
in their ?elds? Corporations have a 
vested interest in doing what’s best 
for their bottom line, while universi-
ties work toward intellectual goals, 
regardless of pro?t. These lines are 
becoming blurred, however, as Carn-
egie Mellon begins to more and more 
resemble the corporations that it 
feeds off of.
Although the size and frequency 
of donations to the university are an 
important metric on many best-of 
lists — notably the U.S. News and 
World Report’s well-respected uni-
versity rankings — it’s frustrating 
that Carnegie Mellon is focusing on 
garnering donations from compa-
nies, rather than focusing than the 
welfare of its constituents. Carnegie 
Mellon needs to build its reputation 
from the ground up by strengthening 
its academic programs and catering 
to those who pay to attend the uni-
versity: the students.
“Often, Carnegie Mellon focuses more on using high-minded, 
empty rhetoric to please corporate sponsors than focusing 
on the heart of the university — its students. The university 
is also facing the problems inherent in corporate-academic 
partnerships and the clashing ideologies of free market-driven, 
globalized companies and the (theoretically) purely research-
driven university.”

Why has it taken this long for the 
Obama administration to consider 
accepting more Syrian refugees?
The United States has only taken 
in 0.03 percent of the 4 million refu-
gees forced to ?ee from the crisis that 
began almost ?ve years ago in Syria, 
according to CNN. 
Since America has been a world 
leader in recognizing the moral re-
sponsibilities of refugee resettle-
ment, these numbers seem especially 
hypocritical.
Just this week, Obama stated that 
the United States would resettle be-
tween 5,000 and 8,000 refugees. 
The International Rescue Committee 
is requesting those numbers be in-
creased to 65,000. 
In response, National Security 
Council spokesman Peter Boogaard 
said, “It is important to note that 
the United States has provided over 
$4 billion in humanitarian assis-
tance since the Syrian crisis began, 
and over $1 billion in assistance this 
year,” according to CNN. However, 
it’s evident that the funding hasn’t 
been enough.
Most of the responsibility to help 
is being placed on the European 
Union, as demonstrated by media 
headlines such as “A European Disas-
ter” (Slate) and “E.U. Nations Urged 
to Accept 160,000 Migrants” (New 
York Times). Meanwhile, there hasn’t 
been enough pressure on the United 
States to act. The issue is our indiffer-
ence, which may have ?nally reached 
a pressure point with the heartbreak-
ing photos of refugees that have re-
cently been circulating the Internet.
Following World War II, refugee 
resettlement in the United States was 
de?ned by two issues: who to admit, 
and how many to admit. Refugees 
were expected to help themselves 
from the minute they were stepped 
into their new home. Gradually, 
America began to consider a more 
extensive process, which has be-
come increasingly complicated in 
the intervening years.
It appears that the United States 
is shying away from admitting more 
refugees because of the complexity of 
the resettlement process. However, 
leaving the crisis to the Europeans 
does not live up to the United States’ 
reputation as a world leader.
Refugee resettlement is a federal 
responsibility that calls for interna-
tional attention. 
It is a process that must be ?ex-
ible, due to the unique and speci?c 
needs that come with every crisis. 
America should consider clarifying 
quotas and even simplifying the re-
settlement policies.
The fact that it takes years for 
refugees to be approved for resettle-
ment is a sad excuse for inaction. If 
our leaders increase the number of 
refugees accepted, the United States 
can live up to its reputation of setting 
moral standards for the international 
community.
Minority identities aren’t costumes for white people to rent at no cost

Congratulations to Yi-Fen Chou 
for being featured in The Best Ameri-
can Poetry 2015, an annual anthol-
ogy edited by David Lehman and 
a rotating guest editor. Shame on 
Michael Derrick Hudson for using 
the pen name Yi-Fen Chou to get his 
work published.
It’s no secret that writers use pen 
names all the time. Lewis Carroll’s 
real name is Charles Lutwidge Dod-
son. George Eliot’s real name is Mary 
Ann Evans. Lemony Snicket, the au-
thor of the beloved children’s series A 
Series of Unfortunate Events? His real 
name is Daniel Handler.
As far as the more well-known 
nom de plumes go, it’s clear that they 
all aim for the same persona: a white 
male. White male names dominate 
literature. Anyone who doesn’t fall 
under that category is automatically 
stored away into their own subgenre. 
This writer is a woman; that writ-
er identi?es outside of the gender 
binary. But they are never just a nor-
mal writer.
Many people denied the privilege 
of being “normal” are constantly try-
ing to ?t themselves into a mold that 
Michael Derrick Hudson already 
?ts into. His work has already been 
featured in numerous other publica-
tions. His biography has its own page 
on the Poetry Foundation’s website. 
Yet he’s found that using a Chinese 
name has helped him “place” his 
work in publications. In this year’s 
Best American Poetry, Hudson re-
veals that the poem featured in the 
anthology was rejected 40 times 
under his real name, but only nine 
times under his pen name before 
Prairie Schooner selected it.
As much as I want to tear Hud-
son’s statistical reasoning and con-
clusion apart, that’s obviously not 
the bigger issue at hand. Hudson 
seems to think that the privilege of 
being a white male with a somewhat 
established presence in the poetry 
world isn’t enough. He felt the need 
to take advantage of what this year’s 
Best American Poetry’s guest editor, 
the famous Native American writer 
Sherman Alexie, calls “racial nepo-
tism.”
I’m not going to call out Sherman 
Alexie for his choice to include Hud-
son’s poem, even after discovering 
Hudson’s true identity. In fact, I re-
spect Alexie’s decision to pay slightly 
more attention to an Asian-named 
author. The only works written by 
Asian writers that I can recall see-
ing in a big-name bookstore are Lost 
Names by Richard Kim and Every-
thing I Never Told You by Celeste Ng. 
And even those, despite praise and 
merit, were buried behind copies of 
the latest James Patterson thriller.
To take on a name from a margin-
alized minority group and claim that 
it is to your advantage is offensive 
no matter which way you look at it. 
Asian names are constantly western-
ized in an attempt to make things 
easier for people who aren’t quite as 
comfortable with the way each con-
sonant rolls off their tongues.
Moreover, names are westernized 
in an attempt to somehow normal-
ize an Asian individual’s identity on 
paper. I’ve had the privilege of being 
given a Western ?rst name, but don’t 
think for a second that I’ve never 
thought of legally changing my sur-
name, or that I haven’t submitted 
work to publications under a West-
ern pen name.
It is refreshing, however, to see a 
nonwhite name credited to excellent 
work. And I know I’m not the only 
one who feels that way, consider-
ing that more and more people are 
clamoring to get their hands on good 
work by people of color.
In a world where minorities are 
constantly seeking representation 
and want their voices to be heard, 
someone accidentally gave the mic to 
a masked Hudson. He might be able 
to steal a name, but he’s never going 
to understand or want the problems 
that come with it.

In the race to put zero-emis-
sion vehicles on the road, plug-
in electric cars have dramati-
cally increased in popularity 
in recent years. Tesla Motors, 
along with other manufactur-
ers, has already found suc-
cess in bringing their “green” 
vehicles into the automotive 
market. Trailing behind plug-
in electric cars, however, is 
an alternative class of vehicle 
powered by hydrogen fuel cells. 
These vehicles offer many ben-
e?ts, including sourcing energy 
from both renewables and fos-
sil fuels, trumping combustion 
engines in terms of ef?ciency 
and leaving nothing in their 
tracks but a trail of water va-
por. Researchers from Carnegie 
Mellon, including Shawn Lit-
ster, a mechanical engineering 
and materials science and engi-
neering professor, have worked 
to set these vehicles on the road 
to widespread adoption.
The main focus of the team’s 
research is a type of hydrogen 
fuel cell called a polymer elec-
trolyte fuel cell (PEFC), which 
can power automobiles by cap-
turing energy from a reaction 
between hydrogen fuel and ox-
ygen gas. As the hydrogen fuel 
combines with oxygen from 
the atmosphere to form water, 
the ?ow of electrons between 
the two reactants generates the 
current used to drive the elec-
tric motors of the vehicle.
Although hydrogen fuel cell 
vehicles have been built and 
tested with promising results, 
taking these prototypes from 
the research phase to the deal-
ership is a much bigger chal-
lenge due to obstacles such as 
high production costs. The cur-
rent production cost of a fuel 
cell vehicle — nearly twice that 
of a vehicle using an internal 
combustion engine — greatly 
exceeds the price that even 
those with the deepest pock-
ets would willingly pay. The 
high cost of today’s hydrogen 
fuel cells is mostly due to the 
platinum catalyst needed for 
electron transport, the process 
that generates the electrical 
current to power the vehicle. 
Researchers believe that reduc-
ing the amount of platinum is 
the most ef?cient way to bring 
down the overall cost of the 
vehicle. Previous attempts to 
reduce the required mass of 
this precious metal have been 
generally unsuccessful. “The 
key to lowering the cost is to re-
duce the amount of platinum,” 
Litster said in a university press 
release. “But, as industry and 
researchers attempt to do this, 
they encounter a previously-
neglected resistance in the 
cathode that prevents further 
platinum reductions.” In this 
way, the main obstacle to re-
ducing fuel cell costs becomes 
understanding this resistance.
“This resistance causes a 
surprising amount of power 
loss, and its origin is not well 
understood,” Litster said in 
an interview with The Tartan. 
“Signi?cant research and de-
velopment efforts have been fo-
cused on trying to better under-
stand it in order to remedy the 
situation; however, the ?eld has 
been somewhat split between 
two hypotheses as to what is 
the cause of this resistance.”
According to Litster, the ?rst 
hypothesis focused on reduced 
oxygen permeability, and sub-
sequently reduced electron 
transfer, in the extremely thin, 
nanoscale polymer ?lms that 
cover the platinum catalyst. The 
other hypothesis questioned 
whether the electrolyte in the 
solution could be poisoning the 
platinum catalyst and reducing 
its ef?cacy, which could also 
lead to a decreased ?ow of elec-
tric current. This split became 
the focus of Litster’s research, 
which ultimately brought 
strong evidence against the ?rst 
of these hypotheses.
In order to determine which 
of these hypotheses was cor-
rect, Lister’s team began by 
separating the platinum cata-
lyst from the polymer ?lms and 
measuring the resistance asso-
ciated with polymers of various 
thicknesses. They determined 
that even using ?lms as thin 
as 30 nanometers did not dra-
matically affect transport prop-
erties. Because the ?lms did 
not impact resistances much, 
it’s likely that they aren’t the 
problem. This means that the 
second hypothesis is the more 
likely one. “The short term ef-
fect [of this research] is that 
oxygen transport resistance is 
not as much of a mystery any-
more,” said William Epting, a 
Carnegie Mellon PhD candi-
date in mechanical engineer-
ing who worked with Litster 
on his research. “Now that we 
have a better idea of where the 
resistance comes from, we can 
?gure out how to mitigate it by 
changing the way the electrode 
is made.” 
This discovery, published 
in the journal Langmuir, has 
shifted the focus of the research 
toward the second hypothesis, 
which involved the electrolyte 
solution. The researchers hope 
that by focusing on the reaction 
between the electrolyte and the 
platinum catalyst, they will be 
able to further understand the 
cause of the resistance and, 
therefore, help speed along the 
commercialization of fuel cell 
electric vehicles.

Several faculty members, 
students, and staff from Carn-
egie Mellon University at-
tended the World Economic 
Forum’s (WEF) Annual Meet-
ing of the New Champions in 
Dailan, China last week. The 
WEF is a Swiss nonpro?t foun-
dation that, according to their 
website, “engages political, 
business, academic and other 
leaders of society in collabora-
tive efforts to improve the state 
of the world.”
The WEF holds two confer-
ences each year, the Annual 
Meeting of the New Champions 
in Dailan, and the WEF Annual 
Meeting in Davos, Switzerland 
in January. According to the 
WEF’s mission statement, both 
conferences attract decision-
makers, experts and innova-
tors to “de?ne challenges, so-
lutions and actions, always in 
the spirit of global citizenship.” 
Carnegie Mellon University is 
one out of 25 universities in 
the world to attend this event, 
and one out of only 12 univer-
sities in the United States. An 
even more impressive feat is 
that Carnegie Mellon’s ?fteen 
person delegation — compris-
ing faculty members, students, 
and staff — is the largest del-
egation among all universities 
that attended the conference.
Delegates from Carnegie 
Mellon included leading re-
searchers in computer science, 
robotics, human computer in-
teraction, machine learning, 
and information systems, to 
name a few. “Carnegie Mellon 
is always on the cutting edge of 
technology innovation, partic-
ularly technologies that collab-
orate with people to address 
the most pressing challenges of 
our time, so the WEF meetings 
are natural venues in which to 
share our ideas and demon-
strate our technologies,” said 
Justine Cassell, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s associate vice provost of 
Technology Strategy and Im-
pact, in a university press re-
lease.

Human-like fossils discovered deep in South African cave 
In a paper published last 
Thursday in the journal eLife, 
scientists discussed fossils 
that belong to a past human 
ancestor which were recently 
discovered deep within a cave 
in South Africa. During the 
excavation, led by Lee Berger, 
a professor of anthropology 
at the University of Arkansas, 
partial skeletons of males and 
females, young and old in age, 
were discovered.
The species was named na-
ledi and was grouped in the 
genus Homo, which is the ge-
nus of modern humans. 
While scientists are not 
sure when Homo naledi ex-
isted in Africa, researchers 
believe it could have been up 
to three million years ago. In-
dividuals of this species have 
small, modern-looking teeth, 
humanlike feet, primitive-
looking ?ngers and a small 
braincase.
The fossils appeared to be 
located in a burial chamber, 
indicating that Homo naledi 
may have practiced ritual be-
haviors, a trait that is usually 
associated with later humans. 
Scientists believe that the un-
expected ?ndings may reveal 
more about the emergence of 
modern day humans, as well 
as spark the re-evaluation of 
what it means to be a human.

Smart immune cells allow neurons to heal themselves
Researchers at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina Es-
helman School of Pharmacy, 
located in Chapel Hill, have 
re-engineered immune cells 
that are capable of produc-
ing and distributing protein 
that can initiate the growth of 
damaged neurons.
White blood cells were 
genetically altered to create 
glial cell-derived neurotropic 
factor (GDNF). 
GDNF is related to the 
growth of nervous tissue and 
has been found to promote 
the healing of damaged neu-
rons. Studies have also shown 
that GDNF may be able to 
combat the progression Par-
kinson’s disease, a disorder 
that causes complications 
in bodily coordination and 
movement. Currently, no 
treatments exist to stop or re-
verse Parkinson’s disease.  
By using white blood 
cells, the treatment evades 
the body’s natural immune 
response, allowing the cells 
to travel into the brain and 
deliver the protective pro-
teins. In the near future, the 
scientists predict that their 
research will be incorporated 
into clinical practice.
Details of their ?ndings 
can be found in an online 
publication on PLOS ONE.

Recent clinical trial suggests new blood pressure standard
According to a recent press 
release from the National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Insti-
tute (NHLBI) in Bethesda, 
Maryland, scientists have 
found that further reducing 
patient’s systolic blood pres-
sure, the pressure from the 
contraction of the heart, under 
the currently recommended 
guideline may decrease the in-
cidents of heart attack, stroke 
and death.
In a study that started in 
2009, one group received 
drugs that lowered blood 
pressure to 140 millimeters of 
mercury, while another group 
received drugs that lowered 
blood pressure to 120 millime-
ters of mercury. 
Results showed that partic-
ipants in the lower blood pres-
sure group, when compared 
to the higher blood pressure 
group, were a third less likely 
to experience heart attacks 
and strokes. They also were 
nearly a quarter less likely to 
die. 
These statistics challenge 
clinical guidelines that healthy 
adults should have a blood 
pressure of less than 140 mil-
limeters of mercury.
In the coming months, the 
NHLBI scientists will be work-
ing on publishing the results of 
their study.

Killer Bees located in California are now migrating north
Since their arrival in Cali-
fornia in 1994, Africanized 
honeybees have migrated as 
far north as the state’s delta re-
gion, as reported by research-
ers from the University of Cali-
fornia, San Diego. During the 
1950s, imported African bees 
mated with local populations 
of European honey bees, in-
corporating African genes that 
have promoted the survival of 
the hybrid offspring. African-
ized bees have been found to 
possess advantages over non-
Africanized bees, including 
better resistance to disease 
and parasites.
First introduced in Texas, 
the Africanized bees have 
spread to many of the warm 
coastal regions in the United 
States. With the advent of 
higher temperatures from 
global warming, scientists pre-
dict that the bees will gradu-
ally move further north. Their 
highly aggressive nature, 
which gave them the name 
“killer” bees, has caused con-
cerns about the further migra-
tion of the Africanized bees. 
On the other hand, the advan-
tageous traits of the African-
ized bees have the potential to 
solve the issue of the diminish-
ing honey bee population that 
is posing a threat to food pro-
duction.

Study says burning all fossil fuels will melt all of Antarctica
A group of German, Amer-
ican and British scientists 
have found that burning all 
the world’s fossil fuels would 
lead to the complete melting 
of the Antarctic ice-sheet, re-
sulting in ocean water raising 
50 meters in height.
In their research, which is 
now published in the journal 
Science Advances, the scien-
tists used computer models 
to account for environmen-
tal conditions, including 
warming air and ocean 
temperatures. 
They were able to conclude 
that there are enough fossil 
fuels to melt all of Antarctica. 
If all of this was burned, land 
that is inhabited by a billion 
people could someday disap-
pear under water.
The scientists also investi-
gated the effect of restricting 
the increase in global warm-
ing to a two degrees celcius 
increase, which is the goal 
currently being aimed for by 
many nations. In this scenar-
io, countries would have time 
to adjust to the rising tide, 
which would then only in-
crease by a few meters in the 
next thousand years. How-
ever, if all the fossil fuels are 
burned, sea levels could rise 
up to 30 centimeters within a 
mere decade.

Latest models of Apple’s iPhone are released to public
Apple has unveiled its lat-
est models of the iPhone, in-
cluding the iPhone 6S as well 
as the iPhone 6S Plus. While 
the size and shape of the 
iPhones have stayed the same, 
the newer models are slightly 
heavier in weight compared 
to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 
Plus. The new phones also in-
clude sturdier glass and alu-
minum to prevent them from 
bending. 
Improvements in hard-
ware were prioritized over 
the development of design, 
resulting in the improvement 
of processing power in the up-
dated models.
One of the novel features 
of the upgrade is Apple’s 3D 
touch, which opens up menus 
of different options by recog-
nizing two different pressures 
of touch. For example, when a 
user opens an image, a lighter 
touch can display a preview 
of the image, while a heavier 
touch displays the image on a 
fullscreen. 
Other new features in-
clude a 12-megapixel cam-
era, and a rose gold colored 
iPhone.
During the past weekend, 
Apple has allowed the public 
to preorder the new phones.

CMU research team identi?es new tumor suppressing protein
RAGHUNANDAN AVULA

The human body functions 
through a combination of 
millions of molecular interac-
tions. In an effort to better un-
derstand the molecular inter-
actions of a tumor suppressing 
protein, PTEN, a team of 
researchers from Carnegie 
Mellon University built on a 
key structural insight to es-
tablish the structure of the 
protein. The team was led by 
Mathias Loesche and Frank 
Heinrich, two professors from 
the physics department at 
Carnegie Mellon University. 
They hope that highlighting 
aspects of the protein’s stabil-
ity and molecular interactions 
will enable other researchers 
to develop drugs to overcome 
the way the mutations in the 
protein could lead to the de-
velopment of cancer.
As part of a collaboration 
that began ?ve years ago, Loe-
sche and Heinrich were ap-
proached by Alonzo H. Ross, a 
professor of biochemistry and 
But even more impressive, is 
that CMU is sending the largest 
delegation of any university to the

molecular pharmacology at the 
University of Massachusetts 
Medical School, to help obtain 
structural data about PTEN in 
an effort to better understand 
its involvement in cancer. Prior 
to the beginning of this project, 
published research on PTEN 
had highlighted its important 
role as a tumor-suppressing 
protein. In a healthy individ-
ual, the normal form of the 
protein acts as an enzyme at 
the cell membrane and plays a 
role in a complex biochemical 
reaction that is involved with 
regulating the cell’s growth 
and ability to divide. Many 
cancers stem from the loss of 
this regulation, without which 
cancerous cells can grow and 
divide out of control to pro-
duce a cancerous mass of cells. 
In individuals affected with 
certain cancers, mutations in 
the gene-encoding PTEN cause 
PTEN to be formed incorrectly, 
hindering its ability to interact 
with other molecules and carry 
out the necessary chemical re-
actions.
However, despite this su-
per?cial understanding that 
PTEN plays a role in disease 
prevalence, little was known 
about the complex mecha-
nisms that mediate its inter-
actions. To better understand 
these interactions, scientists 
often attempt to uncover the 
structure of the molecules to 
visualize them at the molecu-
lar level and understand how 
structure mediates function.
“PTEN belongs to a group of 
partially disordered proteins, 
which means it is very dif?cult 
to crystallize,” Heinrich said. 
The ability to crystallize is 
necessary in order to utilize 
mass spectrometry to deter-
mine the orientation of the 
molecules that make up the 
protein in 3-D space. To over-
come this challenge, the team 
utilized small-angle-X-ray scat-
tering (SAXS), which scatters 
X-rays through a solution con-
taining the protein. Heinrich 
mentioned that this method 
is a much lower resolution ap-
proach than mass spectrom-
etry, but does not require the 
protein to be crystallized. He 
also emphasized that “SAXS 
doesn’t directly give a structure 
of the protein; instead you get 
an envelope of the protein and 
you must use computational 
tools to arrange the molecules 
that make up the protein inside 
the envelope.”
SAXS has been used previ-
ously to explore PTEN, but it 
was always assumed to exist 
alone, as a monomer in solu-
tion. After looking at the data, 
Heinrich and his team hypoth-
esized that PTEN exists in a di-
merized form, where two iden-
tical copies of the protein are 
attached together. With this 
insight, they used the compu-
tational tool Rosetta to simu-
late the protein structure and 
docking within the envelope 
provided by the SAXS data.
They found that in the di-
mers, the C-terminal tails of 
the proteins may bind the two 
protein subunits in a cross-wise 
fashion, increasing their stabil-
ity. Increased stability directly 
correlates to the protein’s abil-
ity to carry out reactions at the 
cell membrane.
The team also explored mu-
tated forms of the protein to 
better understand how these 
deviations from the norm can 
impact the protein’s ability to 
function and lead to cancer. 
They determined that the 
mutated form cannot create 
dimers and will remain as mo-
nomeric subunits in solution.
“It was important to note 
that the SAXS data was col-
lected from the protein in solu-
tion, whereas within a biologi-
cal system, it will be near the 
membrane,” Heinrich said. In 
the future, the research team 
wants to better understand 
how the protein acts speci?-
cally at the membrane.
These insights provided by 
the new solution structure can 
give other researchers points of 
interest to target in the protein 
when developing drugs that 
could recover the function of a 
mutated form. 
The structure the team has 
found contributed to the un-
derstanding of PTEN and the 
complex molecular interac-
tions in which it participates.

Photography is the process 
and the art of transcribing light. 
The modern discipline was ini-
tially born from the marriage 
between 19th-century chemis-
try concepts and ancient opti-
cal philosophy dating back to 
470 B.C.E.
The ?rst camera was called 
the “camera obscura,” or 
“darkened room” in Latin. This 
device could be as large as a 
free-standing room or a mid-
sized box; light would enter 
from a hole on one side and 
could be reproduced, upside-
down, on the other side. In this 
sense, it was more of a projec-
tor than a camera; in order to 
preserve the image, the artist 
would have to trace it onto a 
piece of paper.
In the early 1800s, chem-
istry was introduced into the 
world of photography when a 
potter named Thomas Wedge-
wood partnered with a chem-
ist named Humphry Davy to 
experiment with the camera 
obscura and silver nitrate. 
Their interest in silver nitrate 
came from earlier observations 
about silver compounds and 
their light-sensitive properties. 
In the 1770s, Jean Senebier, a 
Swiss botanist, had dis-
covered that by fo-
cusing light 
through     
a lens, the silver-darkening 
process could be sped up. This 
chemical knowledge, when 
put to use by Wedgewood 
and Davy, provided the basis 
for creating concrete photo-
graphs.
Wedgewood’s experiments 
were the ?rst known attempts 
at preserving the images of the 
camera obscura and earned 
him the title of the ?rst pho-
tographer. His experiments, 
however, were unsuccessful. 
The duo was able to project 
the images onto sheets treated 
with silver nitrate, but were 
unable to arrest the process 
and stop the silver from react-
ing to light. This resulted in the 
creation of an image, but even-
tually the entire sheet would 
be discolored.
In 1826, a French inventor 
named Joseph Niepce created 
a process called heliography, 
which produced images on 
glass or metal by using bitu-
men, a natural asphalt which 
hardened when exposed to the 
sun. After exposure, the metal 
plate would be cleaned 
with lavender oil so that 
only the hardened bitu-
men remained, resulting 
in an image. This pro-
cess created the ?rst 
surviving photograph, 
called “View from 
the Window at 
Le Gras.” This 
technique 
was the predecessor for more 
modern photographical pro-
cesses, such as the daguerreo-
type process.
In 1839, Louis Daguerre 
publicly announced the release 
of the daguerreotype, the ?rst 
commercial photographical 
process. The birth of modern 
photography is largely syn-
onymous with the birth of the 
daguerreotype. This process 
involved multiple chemical 
treatments of polished silver-
plated copper sheets, which 
made the surface light sensi-
tive. The surface could then be 
exposed in a camera for as little 
as a few seconds to produce an 
image. The surface was then 
chemically treated to remove 
its light sensitivity, and cov-
ered with glass for preser-
vation. Daguerreotypes 
created ethereal 
images which 
did not rest 
squarely on the metal plate but 
seemed to ?oat above it, giving 
the image an illusion of realism 
that isn’t found in more mod-
ern techniques. Daguerre’s 
process was widely popular 
until the 1860s, when new 
techniques superseded the 
daguerreotype in cost and ef?-
ciency. Film cameras eventual-
ly replaced the camera obscura 
as the medium of creation, but 
the heart behind the process — 
light focused onto a photosen-
sitive surface — was very 
much conserved.
In the modern 
day, photogra-
phy 
has 
become more  a technical art 
than a chemical one. Instead 
of ?lm, modern cameras use 
silicone chips with millions of 
light-sensitive diodes — small 
semiconductors that record 
information on a single pixel 
of the image. When the shutter 
opens, these diodes record the 
brightness they are exposed to 
and issue a charge correspond-
ing with the amount of 
light — a higher 
charge 
for highlights and a lower 
charge for shadows. These di-
odes function much like the 
rods within the human eye, 
recording only brightness, not 
color. Color is created in photo-
graphs via the red/green/blue 
(RGB) system, which overlays 
these colors to create a single 
colored image.
Photography has not only a 
rich past but a burgeoning fu-
ture; it is an art born of science 
and technology, and it is an art 
that will continue to develop 
within both disciplines.
HOW THINGS WORKHow Things Work: The evolution of modern photography
Topics discussed during the 
conference ranged from issues 
such as “What if machines 
outsmart us?” and “decoding 
cancer” to “What if scientists 
are the new chefs?” and “What 
if your mind could be read?” 
The Carnegie Mellon delega-
tion participated in a variety of 
these discussions touching on 
various topics including com-
puter science, machine learn-
ing, and robotics.
On the ?rst day of the con-
ference, Carnegie Mellon del-
egates presented an IdeasLab 
on “Machine Learning for 
Health.” In the session they 
discussed how machine learn-
ing can help predict neurode-
generative diseases, prevent 
epidemics, and aid individu-
als in the health industry such 
as doctors and health insur-
ers. Various Carnegie Mellon 
delegates participated in this 
discussion, including Andrew 
Moore, dean of the School 
of Computer Science; Jason 
Hong, an associate professor 
in the Human-Computer Inter-
action Institute; Tom Mitchell, 
head of the Machine Learning 
Department; Daniel Neill, an 
associate professor of informa-
tion systems; and Aarti Singh, 
an assistant professor of ma-
chine learning.
Carnegie Mellon also dem-
onstrated advancements in ro-
botics in a variety of presenta-
tions, such as in the exhibition 
“Meet the Robots,” organized 
by Cassell. In this exhibition, 
William Whittaker, a Carnegie 
Mellon professor of robotics, 
allowed participants of WEF 
to remotely drive Carnegie 
Mellon’s Andy Lunar Rover, 
which resides halfway across 
the world in West Mif?in, Pa. 
Ralph Hollis, another profes-
sor of robotics, showcased 
Ballbot, a robot that is similar 
in size and shape to a human, 
that moves while balanc-
ing atop a bowling-ball-sized 
sphere. 
Cassell also presented 
“virtual peers,” which are ani-
mated video characters that 
can hold a conversation with 
students, and have been used 
to aid autistic children and re-
search the use of vernacular in 
schools. 
Cassell, Whittaker, and 
Hollis also all participated in 
a discussion panel on “Robots 
without Borders,” which fo-
cused on the topic of optimiz-
ing the incorporation of ro-
botics into society to achieve 
societal improvements. Carn-
egie Mellon’s CREATE Lab 
also presented its Earth Time-
Lapse technology, which aims 
at visualizing massive data-
bases.
Many Carnegie Mellon 
faculty members were also 
recognized for their work at 
this event. Louis-Phillippe 
Morency, associate professor 
in Carnegie Mellon’s Language 
Technologies Institute was rec-
ognized as one of this year’s 
Young Scientists, a title given 
to leading contributors to sci-
ence, engineering, or tech-
nology under the age of 40. 
Carnegie Mellon spinoff Neon, 
which was co-founded by the 
head of the Department of 
Psychology Michael Tarr and 
CEO Sophie Lebrecht, was rec-
ognized as one of the world’s 
49 most promising technology 
pioneers.
Conferences such as the 
WEF’s Annual Meeting of the 
New Champions allow for 
leading researchers and in-
novators from around the 
world to share ideas and, 
hopefully, look toward an im-
proved future. Public confer-
ence sessions and discussions 
of this year’s annual meeting 
are posted on WEF’s of?cial 
website, and are available for 
streaming.

Colts and Cowboys lurk as possible Super Bowl crashers
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
Usually, the Super Bowl is 
won by one of the two or three 
teams that everyone expects 
to win the Super Bowl. Occa-
sionally, however, an under-
dog breaks through that ceil-
ing, like the Ravens in 2013 or 
the Giants in 2012.
This article takes two teams 
who are not part of the trium-
virate of Super Bowl favorites 
(the Packers, Seahawks, and 
Patriots) and makes the case 
for why they might be the sur-
prise team hoisting the Lom-
bardi this February in Santa 
Clara.
Indianapolis Colts
While many people see the 
Colts as a close second to the 
Patriots or even a favorite to 
win the AFC, betting markets 
still see the Patriots and even 
the likely declining Broncos as 
surer bets to reach Super Bowl 
Sunday. This underestimation 
is misguided.
The main reason is the 
Colts’ offseason. To start this 
offseason, the Colts had four 
problem spots. First, the run-
ning back group was an ab-
solute disaster, with Trent 
Richardson serving as the 
symbol of a group that failed 
to ever do much of anything. 
Second, the defensive line was 
weak, as outside linebacker 
Bjoern Werner failed to justify 
his second round draft slot. 
Third, Reggie Wayne’s depar-
ture left a huge hole for a re-
ceiver across from T.Y. Hilton. 
Finally, the offensive line was 
a mess, with tackle Gosder 
Cherlius simply not living up 
to his billing.
Other spots such as the sec-
ondary weren’t great Vontae 
Davis proved he was one of 
the league’s best cornerbacks 
last year, but one cornerback 
doesn’t make a secondary. 
General manager Ryan Grig-
son took those into account 
as well in free agency even 
though they weren’t disasters.
The Colts ?xed all of these 
problems. Former San Fran-
cisco running back Frank 
Gore, though no longer a star, 
is a competent running back 
who can add yards to the end 
of a play with his patience 
and cutting ability. Former 
Philadelphia outside line-
backer Trent Cole continued 
to play very well last year and 
will add a much needed extra 
weapon to replace the Colts’ 
long time star Robert Mathis. 
Former Texans wide receiver 
Andre Johnson brings Reggie 
Wayne’s experience and pos-
session receiving style while 
arguably being an improve-
ment talent wise. Former 
Philadelphia guard Todd Her-
remans has been great every 
year he has not been injured 
(as he was last season). He’ll 
help shore up the interior of a 
line that, for years, has looked 
like it was hired by the rest 
of the AFC South to get quar-
terback Andrew Luck killed. 
Safety Mike Adams and cor-
nerback Darius Butler could 
help shore up the secondary.
All of the offseason changes 
are reasons to think the team 
will improve, while not even 
mentioning that Luck is enter-
ing his fourth year. He still has 
plenty of room to grow, and he 
has gotten tangibly better with 
both his accuracy and decision 
making through each of his 
?rst three seasons. 
It seems extremely like-
ly that the Colts will waltz 
through their division. How-
ever, with the Broncos weak-
ened and the Patriots losing 
their secondary and starting 
three rookies on the offensive 
line, the Colts might face weak 
competition all the way to the 
Super Bowl. There’s no reason 
to exclude them from the dis-
cussion of who can take home 
the prize.
Dallas Cowboys
Last year the Cowboys had 
an incredible offense, driven 
by a powerful and skilled of-
fensive line. In their positions, 
Quarterback Tony Romo and 
wide receiver Dez Bryant 
were among the league’s best. 
While this team may miss run-
ning back DeMarco Murray, 
running backs rely on their 
offensive lines to break open 
holes. 
Murray was not considered 
a particularly good back until 
the Dallas offensive line went 
supernova two years ago. Re-
placing Murray with running 
backs Joseph Randle and Dar-
ren McFadden will likely work 
?ne.
The defensive side is more 
questionable, but it lacked 
talent last year, too. Rookie 
defensive end Randy Greg-
ory almost certainly would 
have been a high ?rst round 
pick if he wasn’t caught com-
mitting the apparently un-
forgivable crime of smoking 
pot. The return of linebacker 
Sean Lee adds more talent, 
and Defensive Coordinator 
Rod Marinelli has his sterling 
reputation for a reason. The 
Cowboys’ troubled defense 
last season was only slightly 
below average, and still made 
it within one play of the NFC 
Championship game. 
With an improvement on 
the defense and the offense 
continuing to hum, it’s pos-
sible the Cowboys can ?nally 
shed the endless ridicule of 
the last six seasons and grab 
Super Bowl 50.

Women’s volleyball team continues dominant campaign
IAN TANAYA
Asst. Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s volleyball team returned 
to campus for its home opener 
on Wednesday to face the St. 
Vincent College Bearcats. The 
Tartans got off to a quick 3–0 
start in the ?rst set, setting 
the tone early as they rallied 
to a 25–9 score and took the 
?rst set. The second set began 
with a ?ercely contested rally, 
the ball traveling over the net 
many times before ?nally fall-
ing in the Tartans’ favor. The 
Bearcats, undaunted by the 
Tartans’ early lead, continued 
to ?ght tooth and nail. Though 
the Tartans were at one point 
blowing away St. Vincent, the 
Bearcats caught up, eventually 
gaining an 18–17 lead.
The Tartans, however, 
proved to be resilient, refus-
ing to back down from their 
surging rivals. They were able 
to turn the tables and take the 
second set 25–20. From there, 
the Tartans continued to in-
crease their lead against St. 
Vincent, taking the third set 
25–10 and winning the match 
3–0. First–year outside hitter 
Sydney Bauer led the team 
with ?ve kills, and four other 
team members each notched 
four kills.
The Tartans have domi-
nated their competition so far, 
having won all seven of their 
games and lost only one set 
following their victory against 
the Bearcats. Offensively, the 
Tartans have proven to be very 
adept at earning kills. First–
year outside hitter and defen-
sive specialist Lauren Mueller, 
junior middle blocker Jackie 
Gibbons, and ?rst–year right–
side hitter Sarah Jurgens have 
accumulated the most kills 
for the team, etching 71, 61, 
and 59 kills respectively. Ju-
nior setter Emily Newton has 
played a huge role in helping 
set up the offense, marking 
215 assists. Defensively, they 
have recorded many digs that 
would have otherwise result-
ed in opposing scores; junior 
libero and defensive specialist 
Molly Higgins has led the way 
for the team with a whopping 
94 digs.
The Tartans’ efforts this 
season have already resulted 
in a few decorations. Both 
Higgins and Mueller were 
honored by the Eastern Con-
ference Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) following their strong 
season–opening perfor-
mances. Higgins was named 
Corvias ECAC South Region 
Libero of the Week, and Muel-
ler was named Corvias ECAC 
South Region Rookie of the 
Week. Head coach Kim Kelly 
earned her 450th career win 
and 200th win at Carnegie 
Mellon after the Tartans de-
feated Haverford en route to 
their victory at the Haver-
ford/Swarthmore Invitational 
Tournament.
The Tartans have gone on 
to win all four of their games 
at the Marcia French Memo-
rial Tournament. The Tartans 
?rst defeated Thiel College 
with a 3–0 victory, winning by 
25–15 in the ?rst set, 25–18 in 
the second, and 25–15 in the 
third. Gibbons led the Tar-
tans with 11 kills. The Tartans 
then beat Buffalo State 3–1, 
winning by 25–8, 25–17, and 
25–15 in the ?rst, second, and 
fourth sets and losing by 25-20 
in the third set. Bauer led the 
team with a season-high 13 
kills.
The Tartans next faced 
Franciscan University and 
came out with a 3–0 victory, 
winning by 25–12 in the ?rst 
set, 25–16 in the second, and 
25–22 in the third. The Tar-
tans’ ?nal game of the tourna-
ment was a 3–1 victory against 
Westminster College, winning 
by 25–8 in the ?rst set, losing 
by 25–23 in the second, win-
ning by 25–16 in the third, and 
winning 25–13 in the fourth.
The Tartans will return to 
action at the Days Inn Blue Jay 
Classic.

Quarterback Hearon begins senior year
IAN TANAYA
Asst. Sports Editor
Senior quarterback An-
drew Hearon prepares for 
his last football season with 
as much hope as ever for the 
team’s success. The civil en-
gineering major has found 
on the team a consistent, 
positive culture that has re-
mained as supportive as it 
was when he ?rst came onto 
campus unsure of what the 
future lay in store.
Sports have followed 
Hearon through his whole 
life. “I’ve always had a big 
interest in sports at an early 
age,” Hearon said, citing his 
involvement in ?ag football, 
basketball, and baseball since 
he was four years old. As he 
grew older, he settled on 
football as his sport of choice, 
becoming “pretty successful” 
as he got into high school. At 
the Metro Christian Academy 
in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Hearon 
led the team to the state 
semi?nals his junior and se-
nior year, and was named 
Gatorade Player of the Year 
in his senior year.
Turning his eyes toward 
college, Hearon wanted more 
than just a shot at athletic 
glory. “What was most impor-
tant was ?nding a good bal-
ance between an athletic pro-
gram I wanted to be in and an 
academic program I wanted 
to attend,” he said. Going to 
Carnegie Mellon gave him 
“a big change academically.” 
Much like many ?rst-years, 
he came onto campus with 
an unwavering vision for his 
future. “I wanted to major in 
engineering because I knew 
I was decent at math and sci-
ence,” he said.
As the years went by, how-
ever, Hearon learned a lot 
about what he really wanted 
to do with his future. “Col-
lege helped me decide engi-
neering’s not really what I 
want to do. When I’m done 
here, I’ll be entering the ?-
nancial industry.”
He advises those who 
are uncertain about going 
through with their intended 
major to seek out different 
avenues of interest since col-
lege is the ideal time in life 
to examine what they really 
want to do.
Though his academic life 
has taken a few twists and 
turns, Hearon has been able 
to rely on football to provide 
stability. “Football helped 
smooth out everything.” 
From his ?rst practice be-
fore orientation to his ?nal 
season, Hearon has made a 
large number of friends. “The 
people have really made this 
school special.” He has at-
tributed the constant positive 
atmosphere to the coach-
ing staff, allowing him to 
see the team differently yet 
recognize the team he ?rst 
joined as a ?rst-year. Hearon 
has emerged as a leader on 
and off the ?eld, and he has 
earned a few accolades, such 
as an All-UAA Honorable 
Mention for his performance 
last season.
As his playing career 
winds down, Hearon is con-
sidering coaching as a way to 
stay involved in the game. “I 
would like to get into coach-
ing at the high school level.” 
Although he knows that he 
won’t be able to play the 
game as much in the future, 
“football will never really 
leave.”
Women’s soccer shuts out Wheaton, remains undefeated this season

NISHANT RENIWAL
Staffwriter
Coming off a tough dou-
ble-overtime draw versus 
Ohio Northern in their home 
opener, the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team wanted 
to make a statement in the 
second game of their seven-
game long homestand. While 
the game might not have been 
a statement, a 1-0 win against 
No. 18 Wheaton College and a 
second straight shutout give 
credence to the team’s abil-
ity and sets the stage for im-
proved performances over the 
next few games.
The results mean that the 
Tartans improve their record 
on the season to 3-0-1 while 
their most recent opponents 
drop to 3-2. The still unde-
feated Tartans will hope that 
this early season form can 
provide cause for more cel-
ebration over the next few 
games for the home crowd.
The scoreline does not 
re?ect the dominance of 
the Tartans as the ?nishing 
touch or the ?nal ball was the 
only thing missing in several 
moves that could have ended 
up as goals.
After an edgy ?rst half in 
which neither team created 
much, a combination of ?rst-
year Kaili Bruch and sopho-
more Tori Iatarola created 
the ?rst goal of the season for 
mid?elder Iatarola.
Overall, the team had 
nine shots to their opponent’s 
three, while they had three 
shots on target to their oppo-
nent’s two. The goal resulted 
in much more open play and 
Wheaton’s only shot on goal 
of the second half also came 
late as they searched and 
pressed for an equalizer. 
Sophomore goalkeeper 
Sarah Mahler earned her sec-
ond shutout with some con?-
dent keeping and marshaling 
of her defense. She kept her 
composure for both shots on 
goal and earned a ?rst win as 
the Tartan’s goalkeeper.
Against their next op-
ponents, the Tartans will be 
looking to improve their play 
in the ?nal third in order to 
ensure more goals. Despite 
dominating this game from 
the off, had the 88th-minute 
shot by Sydney Sharkey of 
Wheaton been better and out 
of Mahler’s reach, they could 
have been staring at two dis-
appointing draws to begin the 
homestand.
More adventurous play 
with the ball and focused 
pressure off the ball will be 
required to generate complete 
performances. While this is 
all easier said than done, the 
team currently has a great 
combination of newcomers 
and experience to effectively 
maximize their chances of 
winning every game.
For their next game, the 
Tartans face Grove City on 
Friday, Sept. 18 at 7 p.m. The 
team will not only be hoping 
to continue their good run of 
form and remain undefeated, 
but also will hope to score 
some goals to provide the 
several fans that come out to 
watch them regularly a mem-
orable night.

Kanye brings drama to VMAs
Kanye West announces Presidential aspiration in speech
This year’s Video Music Awards were an 
overwhelmingly political event. From the get-go, 
various choices that the producers made this year 
were questionable or ill advised. Miley Cyrus as the 
host was one of the choices I did not agree with. She 
has never hosted a single awards show, nor does she 
have much experience with live television in front of 
such a large audience. Miley has also been known for 
her “interesting” choices. She unabashedly says and 
does things that are not well received in terms of tone, 
audience, or delivery.
When nominations were revealed, the VMAs were 
already causing controversy within the political realm 
by snubbing Nicki Minaj’s “Anaconda” video as a Video 
of the Year nominee. Minaj speculated via Twitter that if 
the video featured extremely thin women, then it would 
have most likely been nominated for the award. This 
prompted the only female nominated for Video of the 
Year (Taylor Swift for “Bad Blood”) to tweet back that 
maybe one of her spots was taken by one of the men. 
Swift made the argument about herself, rather than 
understanding that this is more about a system of racial 
inequality.
The misunderstanding — or as most media called it, 
feud — between the artists was cleared up once Taylor 
talked to Nicki and understood that the tweet wasn’t a 
deliberate stab at her. The media’s portrayal of this brief 
rift made it seem much worse than what it was, and 
news outlets were constantly flashing imagery that only 
furthered racial stereotypes and the idea of the “angry 
black woman” and making the white girl a victim. 
Reporters tended to use pictures of Nicki Minaj making 
faces, but pictures of Taylor in nice dresses. While these 
actions might not have been intentional, they clearly 
show a lack of racial consciousness and truly showcase 
the systemic aspect of racism in America.
On the night of the performance, Taylor Swift was able 
to redeem herself and show that she was not truly 
fighting with Nicki Minaj by making an appearance 
in Minaj’s opening number during the night. They 
poked fun at each other by closing that opening set 
with Swift’s “Bad Blood.” Later on, she was able to tell 
everyone that she’s over everything that has happened 
to her on the VMA stages by introducing Kanye West 
for his Video Vanguard Award. As almost everyone 
remembers, Kanye went on stage and said that Taylor 
did not deserve her award and that Beyonce should 
have won for her “Single Ladies” video a few years ago.
During Kanye’s 11-minute speech, he apologized 
for being disrespectful to certain artists in the past, 
because he’s always been pushing for the art. He went 
on to say that award shows are by definition awful for 
an artist’s mentality because they pit artists against 
each other rather than showing that all of them belong 
to the art. They decide which one is better when there 
is no such thing. He then went on to say the following 
powerful words: “I’m confident. I believe in myself. We 
the millennials, bro. This is a new mentality. We’re not 
gonna control our kids with brands. We not gonna teach 
low self-esteem and hate to our kids. We gonna teach 
our kids that they can be 
something. We gonna 
teach our kids that they 
can stand up for theyself! 
We gonna teach our kids 
to believe in themselves!” 
And he finished off his 
speech with something 
that has left the world 
speechless, and the media 
crying “rant”: Kanye West 
has decided to run in the 
2020 American Presidential 
elections.

Advice for awkward people
Hi, Josh
I’ve just entered into a 
new relationship, and I 
really need some advice. 
Before Joscelyn, I had a 
really strict routine. I used 
to wake up at 4 a.m., go 
on a run, lift, do my beauty 
routine, make breakfast, 
and do any work that 
spilled over from the 
previous day. 
Now, though, I wake up 
around 8 a.m. when she 
wakes up, and we hardly 
have enough time for eat 
breakfast because we 
both have 9 a.m. classes. 
I love her already, and 
I really love spending 
time with her, but I fear 
that by forgoing my 
established routine, I’m 
not being my best self. 
I miss gently exfoliating 
and moisturizing in the 
morning after a tough 
workout. I fear that my 
girlfriend’s presence 
is making me ugly and 
weak.
Sincerely, 
Undergoing Gross 
Lessening of Youth
Dear UGLY,
The honeymoon phase can 
often be an upset to one’s 
daily routine. It’s a change, 
a time of transition, allowing 
someone else to share 
your life. My advice is not to 
stress out about it. In time, 
maybe a week or two, you 
can get back to your routine 
and possibly bring Joscelyn 
along, or even adapt your 
routine to include her. Either 
way, you are going to be 
able to work out and beautify 
again, don’t worry. While we 
do often feel weak, significant 
others are there to give us 
strength when we need it 
most.
Cheers, 
Joshua Brown.

pillbox 09.14.15
This summer I found myself in a couple-week slump 
during which I was listening to a lot of Lana Del Rey. 
One of the best things about Lana Del Rey is that she 
can always be counted on to sound sad. Even Del Rey’s 
songs that are arguably semi-optimistic in content 
sound very sad, so you can always tune out the lyrics 
and just focus on how unhappy the melody makes your 
soul feel and wallow in self-pity for an hour or two. If 
you ?nd yourself listening to too much Lana Del Rey, it 
is always advisable to stand up, shake it off, and listen 
to “Lollipop” by Mika on repeat until you feel perkier. 
For those of us who see the positives of her permeating 
misery and long for the day when we can explore new 
facets of Lana Del Rey, we do not have long to wait. 
Lana Del Rey’s fourth studio album Honeymoon is set 
to be released this upcoming Friday, Sept. 18.
Four singles from the 14-track album have already 
been released. The single “Honeymoon” was released 
in mid-July to general appreciation, with a leading 
melodic string line characteristic of Del Rey’s earlier 
music. Contrary to some of these earlier numbers, the 
string line is sweeter and gentler, and there is less 
of her frequently-used, tortured-sounding synth line 
beneath it. Have no fear however: The song still has a 
wistful and melancholic tenor. It opens with the lyrics, 
“We both know it’s not fashionable to love me,” which 
is completely in accord with the self-deprecating, 
insecure, and romantic nature of Del Rey’s music.
The other pre-released singles from the album include 
the lead single “High By the Beach,” and promotional 
singles “Terrence Loves You” and “Music to Watch 
Boys To,” which were released progressively through 
the summer, the latter promotional single only a few 
days ago.
Del Rey is also notable for her combination of throaty, 
almost deadpan singing in her lower register and 
passionate falsetto melodic lines. If I had to determine 
the biggest difference in the songs so far released from 
Honeymoon, I would have to say that there seems to 
be more singing in Lana’s upper register, giving her 
songs a bit of a lighter feel. In general, while nuanced 
and often disciplined, Del Rey’s voice sounds a little 
less controlled and a little less produced in these 
singles. While there is still reverb on her voice, and 
they do not sound like acoustic songs at all, Del Rey 
seems to have taken a small departure from the extent 
of production on past songs. But believe me when I say 
that, given these songs, the sound and subject matter 
of Del Rey’s music has not changed much since 2014’s 
Ultraviolence. But that’s totally ?ne — Del Rey has a 
sound, and it’s working for her.
In addition to releasing her singles on YouTube, 
Spotify, and iTunes, Del Rey has released a music 
video for “High By the Beach” and has also released a 
small preview music video that features short musical 
clips of all the songs on the album. Revealed perhaps 
most obviously in Del Rey’s short ?lm “Tropico” is 
her passion for sensual allure grounded in historical 
events. A creature of the past, Del Rey’s music often 
re?ects common themes from history or religion. In 
“Tropico,” the story of Adam and Eve was a central 
theme. In her song “National Anthem,” Del Rey 
interpreted the lifestyle of a woman married to a 
politician in a weird re-enactment of President John 
F. Kennedy, with music video blending midcentury 
glamour and modern popular culture. In “High By the 
Beach,” Lana Del Rey wanders around a large and 
sparsely decorated beach house as a chopper ?oats 
outside the window with what looks like a paparazzo 
photographer trying to get a photo of her through the 
window. Del Rey frantically runs through the house, 
and the video culminates with her taking a large gun 
out of a guitar case and shooting down the chopper, 
desperately trying to live quietly and away from the 
limelight. The set and wardrobe in the video are simple 
with Del Rey’s face serene and placid to match. The 
video de?nitely continues the pattern of Del Rey’s 
effortless sensuality and drama.
Lana Del Rey’s life is intriguing to many, and most 
recently actor James Franco has come forward to 
announce that he is cowriting a book about Del Rey, a 
personal friend of his. In a Rolling Stone article about 
the upcoming book, Franco quoted Del Rey as saying, 
“Just write around me; it’s better if it’s not my own 
words. It’s almost better if you don’t get me exactly, 
but try.” This quote is so quintessentially Lana Del 
Rey, and is re?ected in her music. It is never quite 
clear if her songs and videos about love, temptation, 
celebrity, emotional upheavals, are about her own 
life experiences and desires, or if they are entirely a 
construct of the persona she wants to portray. Her 
music reveals personal demons but also evokes a sense 
of mystery and secretiveness. It is this emotional depth 
and complicated meaning that keeps us all coming 
back to Lana Del Rey for more of her soft yet desperate 
vocal timbre and dramatic story arcs.
While this album may not demonstrate an incredible 
level of artistic growth for Del Rey, the album, which 
is produced by Del Rey herself, might just in fact give 
listeners the most authentic portrayal of Del Rey’s 
artistic vision to date. Most importantly, the album 
still seems like an excellent option for a rainy, stressful 
day of homework and afternoons pondering the 
complications of messy relationships. This excellent 
emotional fodder will be available to the masses Friday, 
when Honeymoon is released.

Miller Gallery exhibit explores the art of sound
“Aftersound: Frequency, Attack, Return” focuses on aural stimulation in era of constant visual stimuli
The first floor of the Miller Gallery looks more like a 
19th-century science experiment than an art piece, 
and that’s why it serves as a perfect introduction to the 
gallery’s current exhibit “Aftersound: Frequency, Attack, 
Return.” “Helmholtz (DUO),” an installation piece by 
Stanford-based artist Paul De Marinis, is a demonstration 
of Helmholtz resonators. Candle flames are placed 
alongside large glass spheres that act as resonators for 
a low-frequency sound that can be heard thumping like 
a heartbeat in the darkened space. A spinning mirror 
behind the flame allows the viewer to see the flame 
dance and respond to the soundwaves. It sounds simple, 
but the space creates a certain sense of delicacy in 
watching a small flame tremble from a barely audible 
thud.
The concept of the aftersound is similar to that of the 
afterimage, in that one can continue to “hear” a sound 
after it is no longer being played. The exhibit is curated 
by School of Art Associate Professor Melissa Ragona 
and Margaret Cox and features work from artists across 
the country and the world. All of the pieces explore the 
nature of sound across mediums, such as combining 
sound with a visual medium, transforming it across 
mediums, or manipulating it through technological 
hardware. Many of the pieces are interactive, giving 
“Aftersound” visitors a more dynamic experience than a 
traditional gallery exhibition.
Each floor of the exhibit has its own distinct feel 
and aesthetic. The third floor explores sound along 
with both static and moving visuals, in which many 
pieces explore the transformation of sound waves into 
visual mediums. The second floor, on the other hand, 
resembles something like Steve Wozniak’s garage. 
Large, messy-looking technological installations explore 
the transformation and manipulation of sound using 
magnets and wires.
On the second floor, “IR Chorus,” by Pittsburgh-based 
artist and School of Music Assistant Professor Jesse 
Stiles displays candles placed around the perimeter 
edge of a table. Infrared sensors are positioned above 
the candles, converting the flickering flame to a varying 
voltage which in turn modulates a set of individually 
tuned digital oscillators. This creates a low electrical 
buzzing that can be heard coming through a speaker — 
an actual sound that is created by the flickering of the 
flame. This is an example of how “Aftersound” explores 
the transformation of sound across mediums.
The third floor has many pieces that explore the visual 
nature of sound. “Quotidian Review” by New York-based 
artist Matt Wellins is an interactive software piece that 
links sounds taken from the sound effects library of 
animation studio Hanna-Barbera, to psychedelic visual 
representations of mundane objects such as Coke bottles 
and briefcases freely floating in the digital space. Using 
a mouse, visitors can move the objects around and crash 
them into each other, generating the cartoon sound 
effects.
Curator Melissa Ragona shared her motivations over 
email for choosing sound as the theme for this fall’s 
Miller Gallery exhibit.
“For many years, I have studied the critical impact 
sound — as a medium — has had across the arts, 
i.e. in particular, I have explored the use of sound 
in experimental film, and more recently, how sound 
plays a role in contemporary art. I also teach a course 
entitled ‘NOISE: Toward a Critical Theory of Sound and 
Hearing’ in which I encourage students to deconstruct 
the ‘hegemony of vision,’ the deeply seated visual bias 
dominating Western thought and culture since the 
ancient Greeks. I am currently teaching NOISE within 
the School of Art and, together, we are attempting to 
construct a ‘critical theory of sound,’ foregrounding the 
ways in which we hear (casual, concentrated, distracted) 
as well as the contexts in which listening takes place, 
i.e. the social and historical conditions of reception that 
give meaning to what is heard. Many of the artists in 
our exhibition have often been featured prominently 
in my class readings and playlists, such as Maryanne 
Amacher, John Cage, Paul DeMarinis, Marina Rosenfeld, 
Cathy Berberian, György Ligeti, Karlheinz Stockhausen, 
and Iannis Xenakis. So, I’ve been wanting to curate an 
exhibition on sound for the Miller Gallery for quite some 
time now — to expand both my teaching and my own 
research.”
“Aftersound” will run in the Miller Gallery until Nov. 22. 
On Sept. 25 there will be an official opening reception 
from 6 to 8 p.m., which is free and open to the public 
and will see some of the artists in attendance discussing 
their work.

Complex, technological installations on the Miller 
Gallery’s second floor allow visitors to create their 
own auditory experiences via various manipulations on 
the art itself.

Campus is back into the swing of things, and the 
sheen of being back is just starting to wear off. Joyous 
campus reunions are being replaced by the typical 
late night of Carnegie Mellon homework, and you’re 
probably starting to remember (or just now learning) 
your favorite ways to pass time and put off the work.
Don’t fret though! A new school year also means a 
new lineup of television shows, and we’ve got the 
scoop on this year’s newbies and returning favorites 
— plus a couple of nostalgic throwbacks.
The Mindy Project — Sept. 15, Hulu
The former FOX comedy makes its Hulu debut 
on Tuesday. Episodes will still be released on a 
weekly schedule, but without the limitations of 
a time slot Mindy may just have the freedom she 
needs to ?ourish. This season: Dr. Mindy Lahiri 
tackles pregnancy and commitment with Dr. Daniel 
Castellano, but everyone knows OBGYNs make the 
worst patients.
Scream Queens — Sept. 22, FOX
The latest Ryan Murphy creation is a parody of classic 
‘80s horror ?lms. Focusing on a series of murders 
involving a sorority, this newest Murphy brainchild is 
sure to be ?lled with delightfully horrible situations, 
punctuated by an all-star cast: Lea Michele, Emma 
Roberts, Keke Palmer, Abigail Breslin, and Jamie Lee 
Curtis to name a few members. The already released 
opening credits point toward the sort of tongue-in-
cheek, genre focus Murphy has become known for — 
but don’t expect him to go easy on the gore.
Heroes Reborn — Sept. 24, NBC
In case you haven’t noticed, it is the era of reboots. 
While you are no doubt waiting with bated breath 
for Fuller House to hit Net?ix, for now you’ll have to 
do with this 13-episode continuation of the hit 2006 
series. Some original cast members are returning, 
but this new series focuses on Luke (Zachary Levi) as 
he searches for revenge after suffering a loss. While 
it doesn’t look like there’s a cheerleader to save this 
time around, there is a whole host of new characters, 
many with gifts that make them more than human.
Quantico — Sept. 27, ABC
Another year, another procedural drama with a 
twist. This time it’s Quantico, which focuses on the 
newest class of trainees at the FBI’s Quantico base. 
They’re super smart, super beautiful, and one of 
them is planning a massive terrorist attack. Expect 
a case-of-the-week structure with the added drama 
of national security. The creator, Joshua Safran, also 
executive produced Gossip Girl and Smash, so you 
should also expect some soapy romance and/or illicit 
relationships.
Madam Secretary — Oct. 4, CBS 
Among the many dysfunctional television 
relationships, there was one shining start last year: 
the stable and loving marriage between Secretary of 
State Elizabeth (Téa Leoni) and Dr. Henry McCord 
(Tim Daly). As beautiful as the marriage is, the show 
is even better. National security may be on the line, 
but somehow we still want to know more about the 
goings-on of the McCord household. This season: 
Madeleine Albright guest stars and Patina Miller (CFA 
’06) continues to make us proud.
American Horror Story: Hotel — Oct. 7, FX
Ryan Murphy’s other current show almost doesn’t 
need an introduction. This season of the horror 
anthology focuses on the Hotel Cortez and a series 
of murders that may be connected with it. Although 
Jessica Lange will sadly not be a part of this season, 
many other cast members are returning, including 
Matt Bomer (CFA ’00). Lady Gaga joins the cast as 
owner of the Hotel Cortez. Viewers have also been 
promised connections with past seasons, especially 
the ?rst (including an appearance by the murder 
house).
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend — Oct. 12, The CW
The trend that Glee started is still happening. Crazy 
Ex-Girlfriend is a musical-comedy series about 
Rebecca (Rachel Bloom) who moves across the 
country in pursuit of a boy who dumped her in high 
school. Don’t expect it to be life-changing, but don’t 
be surprised if it turns out to be pretty good. Things 
to watch for: random singing, a slight but signi?cant 
character shift for Rebecca, and a love triangle. It is 
the CW, after all.
Jane the Virgin — Oct. 12, The CW
Speaking of the CW, Jane the Virgin completely 
blew television away last season. An adaptation of 
a telenovela, Jane depicts a young woman (Golden 
Globe winner Gina Rodriguez) who is accidentally 
arti?cially inseminated. A crazy premise that only 
becomes more complicated, this show has the type of 
soul you don’t see much on television, and especially 
not on the CW. This season we pick up after Jane’s 
newborn son is kidnapped by the crime lord Sin 
Rostro. Watch for the heart, but get sucked in by the 
story.
Supergirl — Oct. 26, CBS
In the midst of the current superhero overload, the 
idea of a show focused on Supergirl may not seem 
overly exciting. But don’t rule this one out yet. From 
the looks of previews, CBS’ Supergirl is looking to 
be a simpler, more hero-focused show than others 
out there. Don’t expect crazy interweaving plotlines. 
Instead, the heart of this show seems to be in the idea 
of a hero itself. Melissa Benoist, of former Glee fame, 
stars as the titular heroine, and seems to have just the 
right amount of sugary sweetness to make her cover 
story believable.
For those nights you wish you were still a kid, Reading 
Rainbow and Mr. Rogers Neghborhood now have 
episodes available on Net?ix. We won’t judge you for 
watching if you don’t judge us. Plus, you might learn 
something.

movies
pillbox 09.14.157
This might be my favorite season for movies and, 
fortunately, it lasts about three months. The time 
when acclaimed directors submit their next projects 
to selection committees and world premieres of the 
next wave of Oscar contenders get their time in the 
sun. While films that dominate the Sundance Film 
Festival in January get their summer releases, the 
Toronto International Film Festival and the New York 
Film Festival have become the main stage for films 
holding a fall release, and those that get serious 
Oscar buzz come award season. Here’s a look at 
some smaller titles that may not be on your radar but 
have the right pieces in place to make a great night 
at the theater.
Beasts of No Nation
Cary Fukunaga (Jane Eyre, True Detective) writes 
and directs this war drama set in present-day West 
Africa. Starring Idris Alba as “Commandant”, a 
military general, this film actually focuses on Agu, 
a child who is forced to join a group of mercenaries 
after civil war tears his family apart.
Idris Elba has taken on a variety of roles that range 
all over the spectrum. That wouldn’t be special, 
except for the fact that he always kills it — every 
time. From the action-thriller No Good Deed, to the 
thrilling action of Pacific Rim, Elba brings his insane 
talent to every character he portrays. There’s no 
doubt he brings it again in Beasts of No Nation. Look 
for this one on Netflix and independent theaters 
starting Oct. 16.
Black Mass
The last time director Scott Cooper was in charge, 
we got Out of the Furnace; a gritty and well-acted 
?lm starring Christian Bale and Casey Af?eck. Now 
he’s bringing us Black Mass, starring Johnny Depp 
as infamous Boston-based mobster James “Whitey” 
Bulger. Taking place during the late 1970s, while 
Bulger acted as an informant for the FBI, Black Mass 
is shaping up to give Johnny Depp an opportunity to 
remind us why he is one of the best. Black Mass gets 
its theatrical release on Sept. 18.
Room
There is no hesitation in saying Brie Larson will 
eventually become “Academy Award Winner” Brie 
Larson. She has an outstanding, unsung talent to be 
the most authentic person on screen, and Room has the 
premise to convey that message loud and clear. “What 
if, when we were born, we were mature enough to be 
in awe of the world around us? To be stricken by its 
beauty? And what if we were able to experience it with 
the person we love most?” Larson plays Ma, a mother 
who, along with her 5-year-old son Jack (played by 
Jacob Tremblay), has been locked inside a shed, known 
as “Room”, for the last half-decade. Jack has only ever 
seen the inside of “Room”, and Ma must teach him 
about the world outside of it. The trailer is chillingly 
beautiful and I anticipate great performances from both 
Larson and Tremblay. Room hits limited theaters on 
Oct. 16, to be expanded nationwide on Nov. 6.
Sicario
Director Denis Villeneuve isn’t necessarily a household 
name, but movies such as Enemy and Prisoners 
immediately make my ears perk up. Now I hear he’s 
got Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro, and Josh Brolin in 
his next ?lm centered around the Mexican-American 
border. Blunt plays Kate Macer, an FBI agent tasked 
with preventing escalation of the war against drugs. 
Early showings at the Cannes and Toronto Film 
Festivals have started a hurricane of good-graces for 
all players involved. Mark your calendars for a limited 
release on Sept. 18 with a national expansion on Oct. 2.
These four ?lms will certainly get the blood ?owing. 
In case these don’t tickle your fancy, be sure to look 
into other interesting titles such as Trumbo, 99 Homes 
(Andrew Gar?eld, Michael Shannon), Mississippi Grind 
(Ryan Reynolds, Ben Mendolsohn), I Saw The Light 
(Tom Hiddleston, Elizabeth Olsen) and Spotlight (Mark 
Ruffalo, Michael Keaton).

This summer the Mad Max franchise ?nally saw it’s long-awaited fourth 
installment, starring Tom Hardy as Mad Max and Charlize Theron as 
Imperator Furiosa. Kidnapped by the War Boys as a blood bag, Max ends 
up strapped to the car of Nux, the War Boy using his blood, on the journey 
to Gas Town. The action begins when Furiosa and her armored rig veer off 
course, just as Joe, leader of the citadel, realizes that his breeder women 
are missing. With troops from the Citadel, Gas Town, and the Bullet Farm 
in hot pursuit, fully stacked with armories worth of ammunition and heavy 
metal guitar accompaniment, Max manages to escape from Nux. He joins 
forces with Furiosa to save the women and help them reach their destination 
while ?ghting off the violent attacks. Strap in for two hours of adrenaline, 
explosions, and heavy metal.

The hilarious story of a man and his teddy bear companion returned this

from Lori (unfortunately no Mila Kunis in this one), while Ted (Seth McFarlane) 
has married his girlfriend Tami-Lynn. With the marriage growing stale, they 
decide to adopt. The process then leads the State to determine that he 
is legally property, not a person. As a result, his marriage to Tami-Lynn is 
annulled and he loses his job. John suggests that they take his case to court, 
and they receive a pro-bono lawyer named Samantha (Amanda Seyfried). The 
rest of the movie follows the legal struggle to restore Ted’s personhood, while 
John and Samantha obviously fall in love.

As much as I’d like to believe I’m a cultured intellectual, 
mindless entertainment might just be my greatest 
weakness.
You know the drill. You’ve spent all week working your 
butt off, and Friday finally comes. The work hasn’t 
ended (does it ever?), but you have ten minutes or so 
to breathe. You’ve earned it. A movie is way too much 
commitment, and even an hour seems long to focus on 
one episode of a show. But 20 minutes of Friends? A 
YouTube video or two? That sounds perfect, right?
Wrong. That’s how they trap you. Next thing you know, 
you’re sitting pants-less in the dark covered in Tostitos 
crumbs, and you’ve literally run out of BuzzFeed videos 
to watch. You can actually feel brain soup leaking out 
of your ears. You’re distantly aware that you have class 
tomorrow, but the panic has been mostly drowned 
out by that dazed, icky, self-loathing feeling. You’ve 
transcended to a new plane of procrastination.
What is so darn addictive about #RELATABLE sketches, 
cats being cute, and strangers performing outlandish 
challenges? Well, I’ve decided to punish myself for this 
weekend by puzzling it out.
There’s a science to our stupid crap binges. For starters, 
length is key. The perfect YouTube video spans four 
to six minutes. It needs to be short enough to hold 
your probably short and divided attention. At the 
same time, it must be long enough that the process of 
clicking and loading and buffering feels worth it, and 
you don’t become aware that you have tumbled into a 
chain-clicking spiral. As you click, you must always be 
thinking: “Just one more, one more couldn’t hurt.”
Close cousins with length is cohesion. A quality 
editing job is half the battle won against your wrecked 
productivity. Editing cuts out any boring lag-time or 
unrelated tangents, so your attention doesn’t have a 
moment to waver. Through the entirety of the video, 
you should be laughing, “aww”-ing, about to laugh, 
or engaging in limited self-reflection (i.e. “Why don’t I 
have a cat?”; “Maybe I could pull off a faux hawk”; “How 
hard can it be to sneak a cat into my dorm?”). Editing 
turns a video into a bite-sized dopamine blast. Much 
like Tostitos, you can never have just one.
Now that we have the form locked down, let’s take 
a look at content. A video (at least one that doesn’t 
feature small, fluffy creatures) should satisfy at least 
one of two natural human compulsions: finding people 
who are “Just Like You” and gawking at those who 
are definitely not. I call this the relatable-voyeuristic 
spectrum, where the vast majority of popular videos find 
a home.
BuzzFeed has the spectrum down to a fine art. With 
the sheer scope and volume of its content, you can try 
on identities like hats. Right now, a playlist of “tall/
gay/Asian/awkward problems” is out there waiting for 
you. It won’t be long until your relate-ability standards 
dwindle. You’ll start clicking on things like “11 Startling 
Boob Confessions” because, hey — you have those.
Voyeurism is also a tempting beast. People like to watch 
other people do things that they can’t, don’t, won’t 
or shouldn’t do. While you probably wouldn’t want to 
go anywhere near surströmming (“The Stinkiest Food 
in the World”), people’s faces are pretty freaking rich 
when they get a whiff. And while no one will likely 
ever let you on the Wipeout set, it’s a hell of a lot of fun 
watching equally unfit people give it a try. Maybe you’d 
love to have a professional makeup artist transform you 
into Lady Gaga, but most of us just don’t have those 
kind of resources. Watching it online is the next best 
thing.
Addictive videos allow you to live vicariously through 
other people, and personality is critical. Sure, you’re 
alone in your room, not with any actual friends. But 
keep watching and the strangers in these videos 
will start to feel like friends. Vloggers get popular by 
inviting strangers to peer into a window at their usually 
glamorous, fun, and interesting lives. Even mass-
produced, common-denominator BuzzFeed lures in 
viewers with characters like “The Try Guys.” You’ll start 
thinking “oh, that guy’s got cool hair, he’s pretty funny” 
and end up thinking you might as well watch every 
video he’s ever been in.
Basically, trash entertainment is the slipperiest of 
slopes. There’s a fine line between a guilty pleasure and 
an actually self-destructive habit. I’m still walking the 
tightrope. I hope your balance is better than mine.

Once again the British have come. Once again they were 
great.
For those who don’t know, every year for the past 6 years 
or so — according to director/writer Hunter Allen — 
Scotch’n’Soda Theatre has hosted the illustrious Cambridge 
Footlights. The Footlights, a sketch comedy troupe from 
Cambridge University, start afresh each year with an entirely 
new cast and crew, as they have been doing since 1883. Past 
members include Peter Cooke, Eric Idle, Hugh Laurie, John 
Oliver, and many other famous funny Brits. Point is, they’re 
pretty cool.
This years show, “Love Handles,” had everything, from poop 
jokes to cowboys in love to some gossipy grapes. I attended 
the 10 p.m. show in McConomy Auditorium on Friday night, 
which was the second of two shows they performed that 
evening. While McConomy was not totally full, the show 
was a great experience for everyone involved. The actors 
played their parts well, and it was clear to the audience that 
they knew what they were doing. They moved together and 
performed as a cohesive unit.
Toward the beginning of the show they did a sketch in which 
one character had received another’s arms in a transplant, 
but all control remained in the original owner. One character 
moved their arms in relation to the other’s storyline. This 
scene only worked because of the intense connection the 
actors clearly had. It was rehearsed well and made to look 
thoroughly convincing.
From this they moved to a musical number centered around 
the forbidden but burning love between the outlaw and 
the sheriff, rif?ng off of the Brokeback Mountain trope we 
all know so well. This number, and subsequent musical 
numbers, shared the same sense of humor and wordplay 
utilized by Jermaine Clement and Bret McKenzie of HBO’s 
Flight of the Conchords. For those who like that kind of 
humor, which plays off of preconceived notions, hidden 
emotions, and whimsical wordplay, this would have done it. 
I’m pretty sure I cackled at the line, “I’m not into necrophilia, 
I just want to necro-feel your ass,” which was, arguably, the 
best line in the entire show.
In a later scene, the two men, Luke Summer and Archie 
Henderson-Cleland, are linked together gossiping away. It is 
revealed that the two are grapes hanging on the vine talking 
trash and collecting/telling secrets about their neighboring 
grapes. While this scene in and of itself was funny and had 
the audience laughing away, the most impressive part came 
at the end. The two leaned into an audience member and 
asked for a secret. When they hopped back up, they told the 
audience the secret. What was impressive, however, was 
that instead of simply repeating what the audience member 
had said or stating something previously scripted they 
improvised a secret in almost perfect unison. Now, anyone 
who has watched Saturday Night Live has seen two people 
try to simultaneously improvise a unison line — Kristen Wiig 
and Fred Armisen did it as Kath and Garth all the time — but 
what you may not have seen is it being done successfully. 
While Armisen and Wiig manage to entertain, it typically 
becomes a situation in which one of them comes up with 
the phrase and the other masterfully reads the direction of 
speech to create unison. Summer and Henderson-Cleland, 
however, actually managed to mentally tie in and appeared to 
create the line together in the moment, making it that much 
more entertaining.
Each actor was great at what they did. Summers has a 
great talent for accent, Henderson-Cleland moves like a 
praying mantis and matches Summers’ accent talent almost 
completely, Eleanor Colville fully committed to each moment 
utilizing body and speech beautifully, and Olivia Le Anderson 
has incredible control over her body. I later found out that she 
in fact studied ballet for many years, and thus her physicality 
is less surprising and still incredibly funny and impressive.
Ultimately it was clear that the Cambridge Footlights was a 
unit. These people have worked together for months at this 
point and have really learned how to play off of both each 
other and the audience. According to some members of cast 
and crew, the audience in each place is quite different. I’m 
sure some members of our campus community would be glad 
to know that we are the most heckle-y audience they’ve had 
so far. Well done.
In one of the ?nal scenes Summers, as an Australian 
chiropractor, plucks a volunteer from the audience to whom 
he offers an adjustment. At the 10 p.m. show I attended, the 
man they chose did about as much as he could to make sure 
he was funny. He was, by the way, but what made it great is 
that every time the audience member laid down incorrectly, 
or later straddled Summers in a new and different way, 
Summer played it off beautifully. He never broke character, 
he never got frustrated with the scene, he never even tried to 
speed the audience member along. He simply played further 
into it. His conviction and dedication to the scene and the 
space was expert, and made the event seem much more 
welcoming and open than many shows I have seen in the 
past. The fourth wall wasn’t broken because the fourth wall 
was never really there.
The entire night was a conversation between the audience 
and The Footlights, and we loved every minute of it. Every 
joke may not have landed, but every scene was funny and 
we spent the majority of the show laughing away. The man 
behind me giggled through the whole thing. I love having 
the Cambridge Footlights here every year, and every year 
they manage to exceed expectations. I sincerely hope they 
continue to stop in the years to come, and for those who 
missed this year don’t worry, they’ll be back in a mere 12 
months.

I don’t think I understood how a city could have 
a pace until I came to D.C.. There are millions of 
moving parts, and I feel like I’m constantly trying to 
catch up with them. The people I pass on the street 
seem so much more put together than I am, and not 
just because their business attire is magically intact 
when riding the metro in 90 degree heat. They’re 
smarter, more interesting, and more in control of 
their lives.
I’ve had office jobs before. I’ve had internships 
before. And yet my internship here is unlike anything 
I’ve ever done, because the work never actually 
stops. The office is constantly inundated with new 
information, and I’m only handling a tiny part of it. 
I’ll get more secure in the work over the course of the 
semester, but I don’t know if I’ll ever have the aura of 
confidence that radiates from my fellow metro riders. 
I have a few months to get a stronger feel for the city. 
I’ll come to understand the pace a little better with 
time.
Carnegie Mellon stress culture takes a different form 
here. Work-life balance in Pittsburgh revolves around 
campus events and social groups. Here, there is an 
overwhelming number of intellectual and cultural 
events every day, and I can never quite attend 
enough. I’m constantly impressed.
I went to a hearing and a briefing on the hill with 
interns from my office, which were both intimidating 
and incredibly official. The hearing discussed 
campus sexual assault policy, which felt important 
and relevant for all college students. I kept referring 
back to my Survivor Support Network (SSN) 
training. Then we sat in on the briefing about the 
Rethink Discipline initiative, which addressed the 
issue of disproportionate punishment for minority 
students and students with disabilities. It felt like 
an important issue that wasn’t getting enough 
attention, and yet people had devoted time and 
resources to it. Both events were full of people who 
cared about the issues and had done their research. I 
started to feel like experts were everywhere.
Politicians actively campaign against “Washington 
insiders” with every election cycle, characterizing 
their opponents as clueless or power-hungry. 
It’s easy to make fun of misguided legislation on 
healthcare made by non-doctors or on technology 
made by the tech-illiterate, but the truth is that 
policymakers make policy. They can’t have a 
background in medicine and agriculture and 
education — it’s the unelected people working 
in Washington who are advising, promoting, and 
crafting those policies. I met a former engineer who 
now serves on the professional staff for the House 
Armed Services Committee, specializing in nuclear 
weapons. Employees at federal agencies are doing 
the statistical analysis to support marginalized 
populations. These people are smart and invested in 
what they do, contrary to public opinion about D.C..
I’ve had so many new experiences since arriving 
here. They range from high-profile to small-scale, but 
they’ve all made me consider my own place in the 
city. On my lunch break last week, I walked to the 
lawn of the Capitol to hear Donald Trump and Ted 
Cruz refute the Iran Nuclear Deal. I’ve spent time in 
Smithsonians and got a library card from the Library 
of Congress. This weekend I saw a purportedly-
feminist play that did a great job talking about 
body image and shame, even though the narrative 
revolved around a man. I’ve also been to discussions 
and debates ranging from charter schools to the Iran 
deal. Each of these made me think critically and 
carefully, in a way that I’m not used to beyond the 
academic bubble.
It’s exhausting.
Understanding the pace of the city reaffirms the 
feeling that I won’t be able to catch up, but it’s still 
exciting to be here.
