INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION
Dr. Savage Sends Interesting Letter of his Trip.
Editor of the Tartan: —
At the request of the Directors, I beg to make 
the following brief report of my trip east in the in­
terest of the Carnegie Technical Schools.
About a month ago the Schools were invited to 
take out ' a Membership in the Intercollegiate Ath­
letic Association. This application was filled out, 
and I. was appointed as Director, to attend the meet­
ing and represent the Technical Schools, provided 
we were admitted to the Membership.
It is gratifying to report that we were received 
into full membership of this Association and I had 
the pleasure of attending a very interesting and 
instructive session.
Papers were presented by Captain Palmer E. 
Pierce, West Point, President, which gave a history 
of the origin, development and work of the Associa­
tion. The second paper on the programme was “A 
Chronicle of the Amateur Spirit,” by Professor R. 
Tait McKenzie. This paper was a very complete 
record of the athletic contests that were held two 
thousand or more years ago, and showed in a most 
interesting way that the problems we are dealing 
with at the present time, regarding amateurs and 
professionals and the classification of these men 
was much the same in those days as at present. The 
buying and training of athletes, the supporting of 
them, maintaining special training tables and regu­
lations governing athletes, the selection of officials, 
and the pernicious habit of buying off officials before 
the games seems to have been quite as prevalent 
in the old Greek days as they have been in the worse 
days of our~ American sport. ;
The third paper on the programme was “Confer­
ence, Direction and Control of Athletes in the Middle 
West,” by Professor Arthur G. Smith of the Univer­
sity of Iowa, and was especially interesting. It 
brought out the fact that the Middle West seems to 
have mastered the problem of Intercollegiate ath­
letics and have pretty well cleaned up the atmos­
phere in regard to student regulation. The colleges 
belonging to this conference have gotten entirely 
away from the vicious habits or customs of the past, 
and the students representing them are only such 
students as are actual working members of the col­
leges seeking a degree and an education. The pro­
fessional athlete and semi-professional athlete, who 
is maintained by the college and fed at training 
tables is a thing of the past, and the quality of the 
other teams have in no way diminished, but on the 
contrary seems to have improved by strict enforce­
ment of these regulations. This is quite in accord 
with my own feeling upon this subject, although 
often times difficult for the student to understand. 
There is no doubt whatsoever that, when strictly en­
forced, there are resulting ultimate improvements 
in the quality of the teams where every student in 
the institution has legitimate rights and privileges 
to make every team, provided he has sufficient skill.
The last paper of the morning, by the Rev. Charles 
F. Aked, who is the minister in what is known as 
the Rockefeller Church in New York, recently 
brought to this country by that church, gave one of 
the most interesting talks that I have ever listened 
to upon “Athletics as a Function in National Life.” 
The only regret that every member in that Associa­

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
tion expressed was that we did not have this sub­
ject in printed form, in order that we could repro­
duce it before our various college students. Dr. 
Aked spoke excellently and elegantly in favor of 
athletics, clean and pure and free from all profes­
sional taint. His speech was one of the best I have 
ever heard on the subject.
The afternoon session was taken up with business 
matters, reports of committees, etc. The most im­
portant report naturally was that of the Football 
Rules Committee, which seemed to demonstrate 
without question that the modern rules of football 
have very much lessened the danger in the game, 
and every investigation showed that there were 
fewer major injuries than ever before, although a 
singular fact developed, that there seemed to be 
just as many minor injuries. I believe that this can 
possibly be accounted for by tEè~ fact that more 
complete records and reports were made this year 
of major and minor injuries than ever before be­
cause of the great importance of the question of the 
effect of the new rules upon the future life of the 
game.
There were several other things taken into con­
sideration regarding the changing of the rules. The 
questions of coaching and the enforcing of the rules 
were raised, and the general judgment was that the 
rules would be very little changed for the coming 
year. The advantages of graduating faculty coach­
es were clearly shown, as was also the fact that the 
rules last year were not particularly well enforced 
in some respects, more especially that of the flying 
tackle. There seems to be a division of opinion as 
to the capacity of the officials, but leniency was ad­
vised on account of the complexity of the new rules.
This meeting was in continuous session from 10 
o’clock in the morning until 7 o’clock in the evening.
The next meeting of importance was the College 
Gymnasium Directors, which was held at Columbia 
University in the Faculty Club House.
This Association is probably the closest corpora­
tion of the college athletic, inasmuch as it is com­
posed only of men who have had at least three years 
experience in college work, and who are at the head 
of the various departments in other respective col­
leges. Membership, therefore, in this body is very 
much desired. The discussions here are not open to 
the public nor to the press, as they deal with the 
intercollegiate operations of the college gymnasiums 
and the special problems which have to do with the 
student health. It does not treat or deal with the 
athletic problems so called, but strictly with those 
larger and broader problems which make for great­
er and improved physical well being of the entire 
physical body, and the relation of the Physical Edu­
cation Department to the Educational System facul­
ty, trustees, etc.
Great strides have been made in this department 
since my membership in the Association expired, 
and the value of physical education to the student 
is being recognized more generally throughout the
educational world, as shown by the very important 
fact that almost all colleges are recognizing this 
work by not only requiring attendance upon it, but 
also giving credit for it in the diploma.
The Programme was as follows:
Friday, December 30th, 10.00 A. M:
Dr. John W. Bowler: “Air and Ventilation in Col­
lege.”
Dr. J. E. Raycroft: “The Bacteriology of Water in 
Swimming Pools.”
Dr. George L. Meylan: “Report of the Committee 
on Administration, Curriculum and Staff.
2.30 P. M.
Prof. A. Alonzo Stagg: President’s Address.
Dr. W. A. Lambeth: “Diet Dangers on Breaking
Training.
Dr. J. E. Raycroft: “Report of the Committee on
Construction and Material Equipment.”
6.30 P. M.
Dr. D. A. Sargent: “Physical Exercise as one of
the Factors in the Hygiene of College Life.”
Saturday, December 31st, 10.00 A. M.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey: “Report of the Committee
on Publication.”
Discussion: “The Social Diseases and College
Hygiene.”
Discussion: “The Hygienic Housing of College
Students.”
All these subjects were very freely discussed by 
the members present. The attendance being about 
35 colleges.
This meeting was called to order at 10 A. M. and 
was in continuous session until 12 o’clock at night.
The membership in these two societies settles 
once and for all the college rank of the Carnegie 
Technical Schools.
Yours very truly,
Dr. Watson L. Savage, 
Supervisor of Athletics.
WHITE FRIARS.
Call for Candidates.
The first call for candidates for the White Friars 
show to be put on in March or April, has been is­
sued. The trials will be held Thursday evening, 
January 12, 1911, at 8 P. M., in Room 104 of the 
Applied Industries building. Every man who wishes 
to become a part of this year’s production should be 
out at this first meeting. This includes men who 
are trying for positions in the cast, dancing-chorus 
or glee chorus.
There is no form of student activity which is more 
fascinating and pleasing than that which is formed 
through college dramatics. Every man can act or 
thinks he can act. The trials will go far towards 
showing him what he can really do. If you are at all 
interested in dramatics or stage-dancing and sing­
ing, do not fail to be on hand Thursday evening. 
It is a splendid opportunity to indulge in the pleas­

EXECUTIVE OFFICES SHIFTED TO FURNISH 
MORE SPACE.
The offices of the members of the Executive force 
have all been changed around, from the Director 
down, in order to give a better arrangement and 
furnish more room, which was badly needed, es­
pecially by those who have charge of the new build­
ing operations. The Director’s office was moved 
from Room 101, A. & J. Building, to Room 110 in the 
same building. By this change, Mr. Hamerschlag 
obtains a larger office in addition to a room being 
used for the draftsmen in charge of the new plans.
The Secretary’s office was moved from Room 117 
to the Director’s old office, while Mr. Tarbell moved 
into Room 111. A complete list of the changes is 
as follows:
The Director—From 101, A. & J., to 110 A. & J.
The Secretary, Mr. Field—From 117, A. & J., to 
101, A. & J.
The Registrar, Mr. Tarbell—From 115, A. & J., to 
111, A. & J.
The Bursar, Mr. Woodward—From 111, A. & J., to
1, A. & J.
The Supervisor of Equipment, Mr. Orbin—From
2, A. & J., to 117, A. & J.
The Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, Mr. 
Weidlein—From 1, A. & J;, to 2, A. & J.
M. I. T. WANTS $100,000.
That Much Needed from State to Keep the Institu­
tion on Its Feet.
Money affairs at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology are in a desperate state, so much so, 
according to reports in the Boston papers, that un­
less the incoming Legislature can be prevailed upon 
to provide a yearly grant of $100,000 for the Insti­
tute it will face a yearly deficit to that' amount.
President Maclaurin, of the Institute, points out 
that of the 1,500 students enrolled, 850 are residents 
of Massachusetts. The annual cost of their educa­
tion is about $390 each, or $470, including interest 
on permanent plant, making a total annual outlay of 
nearly $600,000. With each student paying a tuition 
fee of $250, there is a deficit of more than $30,000. 
He has figured that Massachusetts contributes to 
higher education only $38 per year for each $1,000,-
000 of its wealth. The only States which do less are 
Delaware, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Connecti­
cut. The movement to influence the Legislature to­
ward granting the $100,000 already has begun among 
the Tech men all over the State. The annual alumni 
dinner held on January 4th, gave the affair a big 
impetus.
We will all add our good wishes to the cause 
which is so just a one. May the M. I. T. obtain her 
$100,000 and go her way rejoicing.

Carnegie Technical Schools
A NEW COLUMN.
As a paper representing the Carnegie Technical 
Schools, The Tartan has endeavored to serve all de­
partments and divisions of the Schools impartially 
and efficiently. We have long felt that the space 
filled by the faculty or its representatives each week 
has been quite out of proportion to the position the 
faculty occupies in our school life. Towards rectify­
ing this to some degree, we have opened up “The 
Dean’s Column.” Dean Leete, Dean McGoodwin, 
Dean Connelly and Dean West have promised to 
contribute once each month. In this way we will 
be enabled to publish an interesting letter every 
week from a representative of the faculty. The 
Dean of a School has many and varied experiences. 
Some of them are interesting and well worth hear­
ing about. There are many things (both in School 
and out of School) which comes to his attention and 
which, if placed before the student, may help the 
student in doing this or that task or in making a 
certain decision or as a mere matter of current in­
formation and interest. We can promise our read­
ers a number of interesting papers during the year 
and commend a careful perusal of the same.
JUNIOR PROMENADE.
The Junior Prom Committee had hoped to have 
certain matters regarding the Prom decided at a 
class meeting last week but as the class could not 
conveniently convene during the latter part of the
week it had to submit to some delay. While the 
committee is resting on its oars it might be well to 
say something in the interim bearing upon the af­
fair. There is every indication that the class of 1912 
of the Applied Science and Design Schools is going 
to have an exceptionally fine Promenade. The pro­
grams from the standpoint of design and durability 
will be a decided improvement on any that have 
figured at previous Proms at these Schools.
They will be made by a Philadelphia firm and will 
have grayish brown leather covers on which will be 
the initials of the school in gold and in monogram 
form as well as the class numerals in gold.
The dances will be of sufficient number to fill up 
the allotted time given to the Prom.
Ladies who occupy enviable positions in Pitts­
burgh society will act as patronesses, which fact 
goes far in adding tone to the function.
The refreshment feature of the evening will take 
the form of a banquet, the menu being the same as 
that which figures at a banquet. Punch of a more 
or less mild form will be served between dances.
The orchestra procured for the occasion is the best 
that can be gotten in the city. It will be of six pieces.
CHANGES IN ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS.
There are two changes in the Entrance Require­
ments as they find expression in the new catalogue 
just issued. The first is found on page 49, and ap­
plies to the Schools of Applied Science and Design. 
It reads as follows:
“The certificate of the College Entrance Examina­
tion Board is also accepted for the subjects in which 
entrance examinations are required. Information 
concerning the times and places at which these ex­
aminations are held may be obtain'ed by addressing 
College Entrance Examination Board, Post Office 
Sub-Station 84, New York City.”
The second change applies to the Design require­
ments, and states that students may be admitted 
upon certificate from approved schools.
We note with much pleasure that the personal in­
terview is still required. We believe in this require­
ment and think that it should raise the personnel 
of the student-body to the highest possible level. •

THE TARTAN
To the Editor: —
It is often said that it is only the man who can do 
some one thing well that counts in a college com­
munity. The man who is “free from all faults ex­
cept that of having no merits” counts but little 
there as elsewhere. At the University of Wisconsin 
each member of the Senior class is expected to call 
upon two freshmen during the opening week of col­
lege, the purpose of the social attention being to 
discover in what line of student activity the new 
comers are particularly interested. This is an ex­
cellent custom which might possibly be helpful here, 
but the athlete of reputation, the skilled musician, 
the student who excels in any branch of student 
activity is soon unearthed in any event and is wel­
comed with open arms by all. It is the student 
without these distinguished and distinguishing 
qualifications that the writer has in mind. How may 
he make himself a part of the schools’ life by be­
coming in some modest way indlspensible to it?
Last fall, in the course of an address to Harvard 
freshmen, Dean Briggs said, “Work for the College 
and you will love it as you love scarcely anything 
else on earth; once seeing its real meaning you can­
not be base, you cannot even be lazy, you cannot 
forget that high ideals and high principles are the 
most practical things in life, because they and they 
alone overcome the world.” These few words seem 
to me to point out the way for the student who wish­
es to become an integral part of the School’s life. 
The road is one of service, service that involves 
sacrifice, and of loyalty to ideals. A student may 
be only carrying the light end of the bass drum in 
the college band, but he should be doing something 
which he believes to be of service to the Schools 
and his fellow students. Service, like mercy, “is- 
twice blest; it blesses him that gives and him that 
takes.’
There are few students who cannot find time to 
render some service. Studies must come first and 
should come first and schedules are exacting, but 
with concentration of effort and intelligent employ­
ment of leisure hours much may be done. A Rhodes 
scholar, a graduate of one of our best colleges where 
he had taken honors, stated after his June examin­
ations-—“Well, whether I make first or second honor
I have learned one thing that repays my three 
years at Oxford and that is how to work.” I think 
it is a just criticism of American college students 
that they depend too much upon what has been 
called ‘unconscious cerebration.’ We work too much 
at play and play too much at work.
Moreover, fhere is still a place in school life for 
the ‘mere scholar.’ The often repeated statement 
that the high stand man in college amounts to noth­
ing after the doors of his Alma Mater have closed 
upon him is not true, as has been shown by statis­
tics in more than one instance. The technical 
schools with their long hours and ultra utilitarian 
point of view ha/e not tended to develop the old 
fashioned scholar of the older academic institutions, 
but it is to be hoped that future developments in 
technical training will make this desirable result 
possible. The ‘mere scholar’, by holding up to a 
high standard of scholarship, renders most honor­
able service to his school.
There is one form of service which every student 
can perform. The older institutions have their 
great bodies of alumni, their local clubs, their dis­
trict scholarships, their long established reputations 
to attract students to their halls. The Carnegie Tech­
nical Schools have as yet but few alumni and the 
undergraduate students to depend upon. See to it 
that each student does what he can to bring to our 
doors desirable material—men and women whom 
we may help and who may be a credit to us in re­
turn. John H. Leete.
MHO CLUB.
The regular monthly meeting was held on Wed­
nesday evening, January 4, with the majority of the 
members and several visitors in attendance. The 
evening was largely taken up with a talk by Mr. W. 
N. Mueller, Superintendent of the Allegheny Uounty 
Light Co., and President of the Pittsburg Chapter 
of the E. E. I. His talk covered the financial side 
of electric lighting systems and was illustrated by 
cost charts prepared from actual observation taken 
from Pittsburg lighting systems. The subject of 
street lamps was first considered. The costs of 
maintenance and depreciation of various lamps, 
were compared and the main distinguishing points 
of one over the other with relation to their cost of 
operation were discussed. The subject of residence 
lighting circuits was then taken up at some length. 
Various forms of service were compared botn with 
regard to their operation and cost of installation and 
maintenance. In the course of the lecture many 
points and figures in central station operation were 
brought up and discussed. The lecture as a whol'e 
was instructive and was presented in an entertain­
ing' and convincing manner. The balance of the 
evening was occupied by a number of members of 
the Mandolin Club, who gave several selections 
which were well received by the Club members. The 
music added much to the enjoyment of the evening.
Freshman (bringing in some jokes)—I’ve got some 
peaches here.
Editor (after perusing them)—I guess we’ll can

Prof. Colette (translating from the German) — 
“There is a pessimistic saying of Schopenhauer’s

WESTING HO USE CLUB 23—TECH 19.
On Wednesday the ’Varsity basket ball team was 
defeated in its first game by the strong Westing- 
house Club of Wilkinsburg. This team is composed 
of ex-college stars, and Tech’s light ’Varsity played 
an excellent game against their older and more ex­
perienced opponents. The game was a close one 
throughout, the score at the end of the first half 
being 8—8. This half was played under A. A. U. 
rules, while the last half was governed by the Col­
legiate rules. Under the latter rules the greater 
weight of our opponents told, and they were able to 
win by a slight margin.
Moser and Du Barry were the individual stars of 
the game. Moser played a great floor game and 
caged the ball three times, while DuBarry, for Tech, 
guarded magnificently. J. Williams and Kimball 
shot sensational goals on long shots, and Mandeville 
caged one from a difficult angle. The game was 
cleanly played throughout, but it was rendered a 
trifle slow by the fact that a wild pass invariably 
went out of bounds. Dr. Flint, late of the Univer­
sity of Pennsylvania, refereed well. Line-up:

ALLEGHENY 34—TECH 22.
Tech put up a good game against the strong Alle­
gheny team and were only beaten after a hard strug- 
le. This is the first collegiate ame of the season and 
seems to indicate that Tech will be well represented 
during the coming season, as Allegheny has the fin­
est college team in Western Pennsylvania. Tech’s 
guards, Du Barry and J. Williams, put up feature
games, their guarding being superb. Keltz out­
played Hawk, the famous center of their last year’s 
team, getting two field goals to his opponents’ one, 
while he also did much better floor work. Jordan 
shot several pretty baskets.
For Allegheny, Captain Leffel played a very
strong game. He fed his forwards well and caged 
three beauties himself. Tech men will hardly see 
him in action when the Meadville collegians come 
here, as he is going to leave school at once. Nich- 
olls and Firestone also shot well. Line-up:
C. F. S. Allegheny.

Kilgore-R. Williams............F.............. Croasman-Mapes
Keltz ........................................C...................................... Hawk

Field goals—Keltz 2, Jordan 4, R. Williams, Nich-

Linburg. Foul goals—Keltz, 8 out of 15; Hawk, 6
GYMNASIUM NOTES.
The lockers are now ready for use in the gymna­
sium and will be assigned to those men who wish 
to use them. Owing to the lack of space, two men 
will be assigned to each locker. First year men, as 
their gymnasium classes are compulsory, will have 
the first chance to get lockers. The rental, up to 
July 1, will be one dollar, with a deposit of twenty- 
five cents for the key.
Two handball courts have been marked out upon 
the floor of the gymnasium, and it is expected that 
they will be used constantly by the devotees of this 
sport.
Mr. McCulloch wishes to state that, to the first 
year men, examinations and classes are compulsory; 
and that notice to attend either of these must be 
respected.
Head Coach Lightner says that the makeup of the 
’Varsity basketball team is as yet unsettled. He re­
quests that all men who have played basketball and 
who have not already come out for the team should 
do so at once.

'VARSITY BASKET BALL.
The ’Varsity basket ball team takes a short trip 
at the latter part of this week. Leaving Pittsburg 
on Friday morning, they play Bucknell at Lewisburg 
in the evening. Saturday night, they play the strong 
Harrisburg Collegians at Harrisburg. Following 
that game, the team will probably rest until the 20th, 
when the game with Pittsburg at the Duquesne Gar­
dens will be played. Pitt is in the same position as 
Tech, having revived the game after the lapse of a 
year. This will be one of the fastest games on the 
schedule, as Pitt has been showing up well in prac­
tice and Tech has every indication of having a good 
team. On the next night, Grove City plays at the 
Field House. This should also be a good game. Fol­
lowing this, the team will take a trip through Ohio, 
meeting Marietta, Denison, Ohio University, and 
Ceuerville College.
FOOT BALL TEAM RECEIVES SWEATERS.
Members of the 1910 foot ball team are wearing 
happy smiles and bright new sweaters. The sweat­
ers which are of light-weight, coat-cut pattern, are 
very pretty. The garments are white, with the plaid 
“C” on the left side. This is the first time in two 
years that the Athletic Association has granted 
sweaters to the men earning the ’Varsity letter. The 
fact that this year’s team is thus complimented is 
due in a large degree to the economical and effi­
cient manner in which Donald M. Scott managed the 
team.
APPLIED INDUSTRIES.
Industrials Win.
The Carnegie Tech Industrials defeated the Mho 
Club by the overwhelming score of 32. to 12. The 
game was played in the Field House, Friday, Jan. 6.
The score at the end of the first half was 24 to 6 
in the Industrials’ favor. The large score was due 
to the excellent team work and shooting of the In­
dustrials. Longmore was the Industrial star. Line­
up:

COLLEGE CHEERING.
President Lowell Oi Harvard has characterized 
college cheering as “barren, poor and meagre.” 
The Harvard Crimson, the university daily remarks 
editorially in part:
“In the last analysis these statements are true, 
but no one realizes better than President Lowell 
that the ideal he has in mind has never been reach­
ed. While organized cheering is far from perfect, 
stLl it seems to be the only method by which hun­
dreds of enthusiastic and care free supporters of a 
coliege team can give vent to their college enthusi­
asm and the spirit of loyalty, manliness and sports­
manship that is overflowing in them.
“As such organized cheering is a worthy and de­
sirable institution, but it sinks into the worst kind 
of sportsmanship when used only to drown out the 
signals of the opposing quarterback, or to rattle the 
other team when it is on the field. At recent inter­
collegiate contests this element has been brought 
forth most markedly, and it has been forgotten that 
the game should be won on the field, and not from 
the stands.
“It it, against this side of organized cheering that 
President Lowell, than whom no college president 
could be more heartily in sympathy with the stu­
dent, is in reality aiming, and the correctness of his 
conclusions cannot be denied, for under this arti­
ficial pressure, organized cheering does indeed lose 
its sincerity and justification.”
A “fratority,” the newest type of college organiza­
tion, is being formed at Indiana. The members are 
made up of both sexes, and its purpose is mainly of 
a social nature.

TUFT’S PROFESSOR VISITS TECH.
Charles H. Chase, Professor of Steam Engineering 
at Tuft’s, visited Tech on Tuesday and Wednesday 
of last week. Prof. Chase is the visiting member of 
the engineering faculty at Tuft’s for the years 1910- 
1911, and, in accordance with the annual custom, he 
is visiting the Engineering Schools in the various 
parts of the country with the view of obtaining sug-

CARNEGIE MECHANICAL SOCIETY.
On Saturday evening of January 14th, the Car­
negie Mechanical Society will meet and hear a lec­
ture onT the Automatic Air Brake.
Mr. F. H. Parke who is the resident engineer of 
the Westinghouse Air Brake Co., will deliver the 
address. The lecture will be along the same lines 
as the one he delivered at State College some time 
ago, being modified somewhat, eliminating that part 
bearing upon the evolution of the air brake. His 
speech will deal principally with the operation of 
the brake and the various functions of its acces­
sories. While a study of the air brake may not have 
a direct bearing upon the profession to be followed 
by most students at these schools it has an indirect 
bearing in that it gives one ideas that can be drawn 
upon and applied to various problems that arise, 
especially those upon the invention and design of 
automatic devices.
Hence from this standpoint and from the stand­
point of the benefit to be derived from the social 
feature of these meetings, the fellow who attends 
will be well repaid even "though he doesn’t get to 
see “her” on Saturday evening.

The year 1911 is very young yet and all have gone 
forth to battle with a song or a dirge in their hearts. 
Which ever it be, each one is bound to win—or lose. 
Sometimes those who lose in their great aim win 
gloriously in a seemingly small way. These few have 
taken time by the wayside to “help one fainting 
robin unto his nest again.” or “to cool one pain” or 
“to stop one heart from breaking.”
Make up your mind to be generous this year and 
cheat the litle “ego” out of a few choice bits which 
have hitherto been his prey. Give in when a sense­
less argument has reached the breaking point; 
step out when the winning of a contest which means 
only a fresh laurel wreath to you, may mean bread 
and butter to your opponent. Strive to weed out the 
things that last for a day and plant the seeds for 
eternity. You’ll lose nothing by giving away the 
largest, reddest apple and keeping the smaller one; 
but you’ll win the approbation and love of your 
friends and what is more of your heavenly Father.
