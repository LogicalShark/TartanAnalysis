By Jim Lytle
Final working plans for the new Student Activities Cen- 
e^a key unit in Carnegie Tech’s multi-million dollar devel- 
pment program, are nearing completion it has been an- 
ounced by Norman L. Rice, Dean of the College of Fine 
rts and Chairman of the Campus Design Committee. The
on tract for the building is ex-4----------------------—-------------------------
-cted to be let in May of this
ear.
The estimated cost of the new 
enter has been set at 2,300,000
dollars, and will be located on 
‘"The Cut” midway between the 
Forbes Avenue entrance and 
Margaret Morrison Street.
The new • two-story building 
will be built in a “U” around an 
open court. Its contemporary 
styling will be in keeping with 
the architecture of the other new 
buildings slated for construction.
Dr. G. K. Brown, Director of 
Student Personnel and Welfare, 
commenting on the Activities 
Center said, “It will provide a 
focal point for student life on 
campus.”
“Student activities” he contin­
ued “are an important part of the 
students’s education because they 
foster personal development and 
citizenship. All students need a
place where they may associate ! able *o be used as a small audi-
with each other, work together, 
and enjoy social affairs.”
The Activities Center will be 
home to a wide range of campus 
functions. There will be a com­
pletely equipped modern cafeteria 
which will replace the present 
Skibo, known to two generations 
of Carnegie students. There will 
also be a staff dining room, a 
lounge and a snack bar.
Plans call for a large ballroom 
for student dances, a game room 
and Faculty Club facilities. A 
“multi-purpose” room will be
torium or for numerous other 
meeting purposes.
There will be rooms to accom­
modate campus sorority meetings, 
student government functions, 
student publications, a student 
radio station and student religious 
organizations.
Off-street parking adjacent to 
the building is planned. The new 
Activities Center will be a unify­
ing asset to student life at Car­
negie Tech, but it will be partic­
ularly beneficial to the non-resi­
dent students.

Were you able to figure out the 
name of this year’s Scotch and 
Soda show?
The mystery signs that were 
posted all over campus for the 
past few weeks were all clues 
that said, “Set ’Em Up Again!” 
The bowling pins, shooting gal­
lery, fallen cards, and empty 
glasses on the bar were the give­
away symbols.
' “Set ’Em Up Again,” is some­
thing new in Scotch and Soda en­
tertainment. _ It is a “revuesical” 
which is half revue and half mus­
ical comedy.
Story
The story concerns two play- 
rights who have written plays 
which have flopped on Broadway. 
They decide to combine their tal­
ents and opposite styles to pro­
duce a top-notch hit.
Ethereal and earthy scenes are 
united to tell the story of a boy 
and girl from entirely different 
backgrounds who meet and fall in 
love. Family opposition to the af­
fair is so great that the lovers are 
forced to run away.
Musical Journey
They make a musical journey 
around the world and discover 
that no matter where they go, 
they encounter the girl’s guardian 
who is following them. Finally, in 
South America, the writers have 
the boy incite a revolution to elect 
the rich guardian president.
The couple, thinking that he is 
out of their way return to their 
hometown and manage to get 
married, although the end of the 
ceremony becomes quite hectic, 
thanks to the guardian’s return.
Colorful Sets
Although the basic plot of the 
story is boy meets girl and falls 
in love, the manner of presenta­
tion is new and exciting. The sets 
promise to be intriguing and 
colorful as only the theater-in- 
the-round can provide.
Student Congress
There will be a Student 
Congress meeting this after­
noon, January 14, at 4:30 in 
Porter Hall 100.
Sale of New Scot 
Calendar Issue

The Scot will make its- second 
appearance on campus this year 
with its calendar issue, featuring 
double-page pictures of twelve 
Tech co-eds.
It will go on sale next Wednes­
day, January 21, at noon in Skibo. 
Scot staff members state that if 
previous sales were any indica­
tion, this issue won’t last long, 
and they say, “Be sure to get 
your copy early.”

Tech Announces New 
High School Program
CIT announced in December that it will cooperate with 
the Pittsburgh public school system in a plan that will permit 
gple students in city high schools to undertake work in cer­
tain subjects, commensurate with their abilities.
At present, the program calls for Carnegie’s history and
English departments to cooperate* 
with the public school system in 
the designing of college-level 
courses in European history and 
English at Allderdice, Peabody, 
Perry, and South Hills High«
hools. It is expected that the 
ogram will eventually be ex­
panded to mathematics, biology, 
chemistry, and physics.
College Credit
The plan, known as the Ad­
vanced Placement Program, has 
been developed by the College 
Entrance Examination Board, 
principal testing organization for 
students seeking college entrance, 
mid has the endorsement of the 
Pittsburgh Board of Education.
Students enrolling in these care­
fully designed courses may, upon 
completion, be eligible to take ex­
aminations which the college of 
their choice will consider for 
credit.
More Electives
This does not mean that the 
Ime spent in college will neces­
sarily be shortened from the pres­
ent four years, but it does mean 
the student will have a chance to 
broaden his education because he 
will have more; time for elective
Bell Presenting 
Jazz Concert
The Charles Bell Contemporary 
Jazz Quartet will present the 
second in a series of concerts, 
Saturday, January 17, 8:15 p.m., 
at the Carnegie Lecture Hall.
The group was enthusiastically 
received by both the public and 
such noted critics as: John Nuss- 
baum (Sun Telegraph), Donald 
Steinfirs (Post-Gazette), and 
Frank Bolden (Courier), at the 
first concert of the series.
Group Members
Featured in the group are: 
Charles Bell, piano; Dick Hiller, 
bass, (junior at Carnegie Tech);
Chuck Leroy, Vibes; and Allen 
Blairman, drums, (Carnegie Tech 
graduate). Joe Negri, guitar, will 
appear as guest artist.
The progarm will consist chief­
ly of original compositions by Mr. 
Bell. It will also include his own 
arrangements of a trio of Gersh­
win tunes, and the music of Thel- 
onious Monk.
Featured Work
The featured work for the com­
ing concert will be a song-cycle 
entitled, “Chamber Music.” Mr. 
Bell has set to music for jazz 
quartet and mezzo-soprano, five 
poems from James Joyce’s book 
of poetry entitled “Chamber 
Music.” Kenna Copeland, a voice 
major in her senior year at Car­
negie Tech, will sing the solo 
mezzo-soprano part for this com­
position.
The quartet was formed early 
in the spring of 1958. They are 
developing themselves primarily 
for concert performances only. It 
is the aim of the group to pre­
sent to their audience a wide 
range of musical experience. They 
will concentrate solely on giving 
a program of good jazz only. The 
audience will hear new composi­
tions by Mr. Bell as well as orig­
inal treatment of tunes that have 
become known as jazz standards.
Jazz and Classical
Mr. Bell’s approach towards 
composition is for a synthesis be­
tween jazz and classical music. 
In general, the idea is not a new
one. There have been many jazz 
symphonies and concertos written 
using classical music in a “jazzed- 
up” form. The difference in Bell’s 
approach is in the treatment of 
thematic, harmonic and rhythmic 
ideas which, (more often then 
not) are of jazz origin.
He uses all of the compositional
technique and crafts that have 
been acquired through the study 
of the classics without sacrificing 
the basic spirit and mood of jazz. 
He believes that synthesis of this 
sort will provide a jazz form 
with a much wider emotional, 
intellectual, dramatic and poetic 
scope.

courses.
A main philosophy of the ad­
vanced placement program recog­
nizes that all students do not have 
jflfiuai abilities or interests. As 
the very slow student needs a 
slower pace than the average stu­
dent, so the very able student 
should be encouraged to proceed 
at a faster pace.
The program is thus an instru­
ment of cooperation which ex­
tends the educational opportuni­
ties to able ambitious students by 
coordinating effectively their work 
in secondary schools and colleges. 
iP Tech Enthusiastic
Carnegie Tech officials, Dr. Paul 
Ward, head, history, and Dr. Aus­
tin Wright, head, English; and 
Dr. Calvin E. Gross, superintend­
ent of the city schools, expressed 
the hope that as the program 
progresses, the various educational 
bodies concerned will be able* to 
cooperate more closely and more 
actively in the development of 
course content, teaching methods 
£nd materials, and in the inter­
change of teachers.
“This,” - said Dr. Gross, “is ex­
tremely important to insure that 
our advanced classes do not de­
generate into mere cram sessions. 
The emphasis must be on sound 
educational principles and not on 
the amassing of rote knowledge 
to pass a test.”
He emphasized that, “If care­
fully developed, the advanced 
placement program, can become 
a powerful force in strengthening 
our entire educational system 
which needs to be attuned to the 
space age and to keener competi­
tion than it has ever known be­
fore.”

Calculating Cal was interested in continuing to train 
his inquisitive engineering mind. He wanted to be sure 
he was with a progressive company which would invest

Maximum Mac enjoyed production problems. He 
wanted to join a company whose growth would be 
rapid during the next ten years thereby creating an 
abundance of production challenges. He wanted a 
company that would take full advantages of his pro­
duction know-how.
Gregarious George wanted to be part of a team.

Le Bal Masque
Francis Poulenc, born in France in 1899, was discouraged 
by his parents from pursuing a career in music. Fortunately, 
he did not heed advice, began composing while still in his 
teens, and is now considered one of the outstanding contem­
porary composers. A prolific writer, he has several hundred 
compositions to his credit, among which is Le Bal Masque, a 
secular cantata set to poems by Max Jacob. Le Bal Basque, 
written in 1932, is scored for oboe, clarinet, bassoon, cornet, 
violin, cello, percussion, piano, and baritone voice; and is a 
veritable musical carnival, leading the mind through a 
variety of musical experiences. Poulenc once said of it: “The 
Masked Ball is, for me, a sort of Carnival Nogentais, with 
sketches of several monsters seen, in my childhood, along 
the banks of the Marne.” The final section, Mon gilet quadrille 
(My Checkered Vest), is a portrait of Max Jacob. The music, 
as witty and ingeniously contrived as are the words, deserves 
a hearing. It has been recorded both by Westminster and by 
Esoteric. The words as translated are as follows:
1. Preambule et Air de Bravoure: Madam Crown Prin­
cess will not see the pretty picture, which one had made with 
the noseworms, because she has been buried with her first 
born at Naterre where she is buried. When a peasant of China 
wants fresh products, he goes to the printer, or to the lady 
next door. All the peasants of China had watched them to put 
little shoes on them, and they cut their feet. The Count 
d’Artois has gone on the roof to count the tiles and see thru 
the spyglass, if the moon is bigger than the finger. A steam­
boat and its cargo is rammed against the house. Let’s steal 
some goose grease, to make cannons.
2. Intermede.
3. Malvina: Now I hope to frighten you! Miss Malvina 
does not let her fan go since she is dead. Her pearl-grey glove 
is starred with gold . . . She twists herself like a gypsy waltz. 
She comes to die of love to your door. Near the rack where 
we put the walking stick . . . Let’s say she had died of dia­
betes, Died of the heavy perfume that weighted her neck. Oh! 
The honest creature so chaste and so little foolish, less greedy 
than greedy. She had thick blood was bachelor of arts and 
had charge of classes. It was with a top hat that one courted 
her. One would have had her in a raping manner . .. Malvina,

5. La Dame Aveugle: The blind woman whose eyes 
bleed chosses her words. Shfe never speaks to, anyone about 
her sufferings. She has hair like moss, she wears jewels and 
reddish stones. The fat and blind woman whose eyes bleed 
writes polite letters with margins and interspaces. She is 
careful of the pleats of her velvet dress, and she makes an 
effort to do more. And if I don’t mention handsome brother, 
that is because this young man is not looked well upon here 
for he gets drunk and has the blind one getting drunk who 
laughs, laughs then and bellows. Ah! the blind woman . . .
6. Finale: The limping mechanic of old cars, the hermit, 
alas, has gone back to his nest. Be my beard, by my beard, 
I’m too old for Paris. The angle of your houses hurt my 
ankles. My checkered vest, they say, an etruscan air and my 
brown hat doesn’t go well with my casuals. Attention, this 
(placard) that has been put on my door. In this lodging 
everything smells of dead goatskin.

By Rico Lebrun
An exhibition of pen and ink, 
wash, and chalk drawings by«
ico Lebrun is presently being 
lown in the Hewlett Gallery, 
College of Fine Arts. The exhibit 
will be on display through Jan­

Fellowship
In both 1936 and 1937,-Mr. Le­
brun received Guggenheim Fel­
lowships and during these years 
he taught drawing and mural 
painting at the Art Students 
League in New York. He moved€
 southern California the fol- 
wing year, where he taught at 
the Chouinard Art Institute in 
Los Angeles.
Following West Coast exhibi­
tions of his work and representa­
tion in the Museum of Modern 
Art’s exhibition^ “America 1942,” 
he became artist-in-residence at 
the Santa Barbara Museum of 
Art. In 1947, Mr. Lebrun became 
a member of the faculty of the 
Jepson Art Institute, Los Angeles. 
^ Mr. Lebrun’s work was among 
that of six artists selected to rep­
resent the United States at the 
Venice Biennale exhibition in 
1950. Two years later he receiv­
ed the Award of Merit of the 
American Academy of Arts and 
Letters. Following his year’s pro­
fessorship at Yale, he will be­
come painter-in-residence at the 
American Academy in Rome.
^ Themes
™ Mr. Lebrun’s drawings reflect 
religious and concentration camp 
themes, the environment of Mex­
ico, and studies of the old mas­
ters.
Commenting on his works, Mr. 
LeBrun said, “Composition is 
born out of the shocked heart. 
First a man, second a designer, 
I must at this point find out that 
pain has a geometry of its own. 
^>nce, they said I could draw 
™s a bird sings, possibly I still 
can.”
“But there came a time when 
the image of man was so defaced 
that bird songs did not seem 
enough. If I had to lose all my 
virtues as a passable draughts­
man for the sake of speaking tru­
ly about the unmanageable de­
sign of our condition, I would do 
so gladly. Talent is one thing, life 
another.”

job and keeps me hopping,” says Bill. “See for yourself.”
"8:30 a.m. With my test bureau fore-

"11:00 a.m. As soon as things are lined 
up at the office, I drive out to check on

Tartans Down Waynesburg; 
Bow To Titans, W&J, Gannon
Tartan courtmen faired poorly^
in their last four outings, just 
managing to take one from the 
somewhat undersized Waynesburg 
College. Previously to the Waynes­
burg contest, the Skibos dropped 
three straight to Westminster, 
W&J, and Gannon respectively.
Fresh from a trio of wins, the 
Tartans next faced the strong 
Titans from Westminster. All 
signs in the first half pointed to 
another Tech victory. The Skibos 
pulled away midway throught the 
first half, with the deadly shoot­
ing of guards Bill Soffa and Bob 
Hauser, gaining an eleven point 
lead (-22-11). At the recess, Tech 
advanced the lead to 15 points 
(36-21).
Titans Return
The Titans bounced back after 
the rest and began putting doubt 
into the spectators minds as to 
whether they were the same team 
that played the first half. Hitting 
six points in a row and outscoring 
our lax Tartans (21-7) in the 
ensuing five minutes, the Titans 
closed the gap to one point (43- 
42). The two teams traded baskets 
for the rest of the match until 
Titan forward Ron Minnie threw 
in the winning hoop for West­
minster (61-60).
Drawback
The main drawback for Tech in 
the Westminster game was their 
inability to move against the 
Titan zone defense in the second 
half. Passes were thrown away 
and the team had to take long 
outside shots in this contest.
This typified the hard breaks 
that Tech was to suffer that week 
for it was learned that Bill Soffa 
would miss the W&J game with a 
bad back.
Soffa Missed
The contest against W&J 
proved that Tech needed Soffa to 
win and that Hauser could not 
carry the load single-handedly 
(but he made a darn good at­
tempt).
Coach Cratsley threw in every­
one he had (even the Finalw in a 
vain effort to find replacement, 
but the best Tech could do was 
to trail by two points at the half 
30 to 28.
Hauser collected nine points 
during the period but on the 
whole Tech’s shooting was poor. 
W&J came back even stronger in 
the second half and broke away, 
at the mid-second half, by 7 
points 56-49. The Prexies con­
tinued their spree, winning 74 to 
62. Tech showed its lack of depth 
by the fact that nearly two-thirds 
of the points were by Komer (21) 
and Hauser (18).
Gannon
The Gannon Knights defeat was 
the biggest heart breaker of all. 
With neither team able to build 
up a lead of more than five points 
throughout the game, Tech found 
themselves trailing by one point,
64-63 with just 35 seconds left to 
go. Then a jump shot by Stan 
Skalka put the Tartans up by 
one with just seconds remaining
65-64. Another Skibo victory was 
in sight and would have been 
fact if not for an instance.
Gannon’s Roberts had the ball 
under his own basket, drove I 
around, shot and missed with the 
buzzer sounding, ending the game 
and an apparent victory for Tech [
(as was thought by some 300 
spectators). However, just previ­
ous to the buzzer and unseen by 
the spectators, the referee raised 
his hand signalling a Tartan foul. 
Roberts of Gannon shot and made 
both free throws to give the 
Knights the victory 66-65.
' Victory 
The Tartan hoopsters went to 
Waynesburg Wednesday quite 
peeved at the Westminster and
Gannon squeakers. They left quite 
contented, however, smothering 
Waynesburg under with an 82-49 
victory. Tech’s rally was led by 
Stan Skalsa who netted 27 points 
which is the individual Tech high 
this season. Tech never trailed in 
the match and led at half time 
42-26. They opened the spread to 
33 points at the finale 82-49.
The Skibos now stand at an 
even .500 mark with 4 wins and

The Tech W.A.A. beat the Pitt 
majors in volleyball. This wasn’t 
the only game won by this ambit­
ious group of girls—out of a total 
of six games, four were won and 
two lost.
Tech bowed to Chatham and Mt. 
Mercy at the beginning of the 
season, but came back to win the 
final four games from Chatham, 
Mt. Mercy, Pitt, .W.A.A. and the 
Pitt majors.
Members of the team were:

The Tech team counts this as 
one of the best seasons and are 
looking forward to an even better 
one next year.

To Save Time
To help reduce the amount of 
time spent by students in the reg­
istration area, the plan for pre­
payment of fees will be in effect 
for the Spring Semester 1958-59, 
All students may participate in Jhe 
plan except students in the Mi- 
lowing categories:
1. Students who will be carrying 
24 units or less.
2. Junior and Senior Painting and 
Design students.
Those students who are not ex­
cluded and who wish to partici­
pate in the plan will proceed as 
follows:
At any time during the period 
of January 12 through January^ 
students may stop at the Regis­
trar’s Office and make their pay­
ments. However, it must be un­
derstood that for dormitory stu­
dents, the dormitory fee must be 
paid at the same time.
It also should be understood 
that all students, whether parti­
cipating or not, must appear at 
the registration area the same as 
always to complete schedules and 
fill out IBM forms, but the mt- 
dents who have prepaid their fees 
will not be required to go to the 
Women’s Gym where the Cashier 
will be set up.

Last week intramural basket- I !^|U got underway, and from first 
1 glances, there appears to be 
I twelve better than average teams. 
I Since the members of last year’s 
I champs, the Rockets, graduated, I there will be new campus champs 
| this year.
There are two overloaded 
f leagues, the Long Shots and the 
| Set Shots. However, the Foul 
i Shot league should be dominated 
I by one team.
® Long Shot League
ATO “A” should win the Long 
| Shot league with its outstanding 
team work. However, the pressure 
| will be on last year’s runners-up 
I sin$e they have to meet two 
I strong contenders in a tall BTP 
’ team, and a rugged TKN aggre- 
| gate.
The Set Shot league finds three 
I equally strong teams opposing 
i each other. The favorite, TDP, 
% Ulould get more than a good fight 
| from both Sigma Nu and this 
I year’s football champs, the Met 
I Grads.
The Falcons, most likely suc- 
§ cessor to the Rockets’ title, may 
I have a bit of trouble in Phi Kap- 
j pa “B”; but, otherwise, will run 
I away with their league.
In the Hook Shot league, the 
I Englishmen will have very little 
I competition in SAE “A” and the 
* Htchitects; while in the Drive 
I Shot league, KS and DTD will 
P fight each other for first place.
All School Candidates
There appears to be eleven 
I candidates for the All-School 
I team. They are: Mike Flynn, “B”; 
I Jim Beisler and Boyd Doxtader, 
I both Englishmen; Ben Patz, Met 
I Grads; Rick Gesue, ATO “A”; 
I Jim Muth, TKN; Charley Betz, 
I |AE “A,” and Bennie Perlmutter, 
I *f>P.

semi-final with the Tau Delts. 
Bimbo Roth made many beautiful 
saves, but not enough as his Tau 
Delt team met defeat, 15-8, 15-6. 
Thomas, Reber, G. Wright, Gor­
don and Charles Betz seemed to 
be too strong for the presistent 
TDP team; however, the scores 
do not indicates the good struggle 
the Tau Delts made.
In the other semi-final game, 
ATO “A” proved to be too much 
for the Newman Club. Bieg and 
Garibaldi continued to play ex­
ceptionally well as they led their 
team to identical victories of 
15-11.
Champs A|,ain
The finals saw the first two 
seeded teams meet in the play­
off, SAE and ATO. On Thursday, 
SAE became champs of the cam­
pus for the third straight year by 
turning in scores of 15-3, 15-3. 
Thomas, Reber, Aust, G. Wright, 
Gordon, and Betz just couldn’t 
do wrong.
By watching the games, and 
comparing scores the top eight 
teams were in this order: (1)
SAE “A,” (2) ATO “A,” (3) TDP, 
(4) SN, (5) SAE “B,” (6) ATO 
“B,” (7) Newman Club, (8) the 
Physics Grads.
Top Players
The top six spikers were 
Reber, Aust, Beig. Maddrey, Ben­
nie Perlmutter, and Nix; the top
six setters, Thomas, G. Wright, 
Garibaldi, Gordon, P. Wright, and 
Roth.
Again, George Thomas looked 
like the most valuable player in 
the school due to his professional 
style of play; but he should re­
ceive competition from teammate 
Bob Reber for the honor.
Scholarships
UpperclSss scholarship ap­
plication forms are now avail­
able in AH 154. All scholar­
ship holders should submit ap­
plications even though their 
scholarships are subject to 
automatic renewal.

Tournament volleyball play 
gan Monday night before the 
Christmas vacation, with six 
trjrns playing in the round while 
tjH^e teams from the Ace League 
played off a tie for escond place. 
The tournament ended the Thurs­
day before holiday recess with 
SAE reigning as champs for the 
third straight year.
The playoff came about 'as a 
result of PiKA defeating TX on 
the final day before the start of 
tournament play by scores of 16- 
14, 13-15, 15-13. Therefore, on 
jnday the same two teams met 
liin, but this time TX won the 
set by scores of 15-11, 11-15, 15- 
12. Bob Patten and Dick Brand 
led TX, while Fred Heider was 
the lone stand-out for the PiKA’s.
Second Place
To determine the second place 
•winner, Theta Xi had to play an­
other gruelling match with SN 
immediately after they played the 
PiKA’s. This time the results 
'j|rp not as favorable for the 
Tmeta’s as they lost the set by 
I scores of 15-7, 5-15, 15-0. Jim 
I Flowers and Charley Maddrey 
| starred for SN; Patton and Brand 
I again for TX.
Due to a mistake in reported 
I scores, ATO “B” was in the tour- I nament instead of the Kappa Sigs. 
I The “B” team made a very im- 
¦ pressive showing in almost up- I setting a strong Tau Delt team, 
I l|-5, 12-15, 15-13.
Newman Team
Newman Club, the Cinderella 
I team, looked like the favorites
as they stomped the Physics 
Grads 15-4, 15-3. Bill Hughes’ 
spiking led the victors.
However, the most exciting and 
best played game of the first night 
of play was between ATO “A” 
and SAE “B”. Hard spiking by 
Ray Nix and Bob Miller, SAE 
“B” players, was matched by Tom 
Beig and Owen Johnson. Fred 
Baribaldi, ATO “A,” and Paul 
Wright, SAE, were, by far, the 
best of the night.
Fourth Game
The fourth first round game 
was played Wednesday between 
SAE “A” and SN. Although Sig­
ma Nu was the only team, thus 
far, to win one game from SAE, 
they were unfortunate enough to 
have .o face the defending 
champs again. In two games, 
George Thomas’ serves amounted 
to 14 points, while Gerry Wright’s 
and Bob Gordon’s sets were per­
fect for Bob Reber’s and Dick 
Aust’s spikes. The scores were 
15-5, 15-1.
Immediately after they finished 
one game, SAE had to play a
In a lecture given in the past year at Columbia 
University, Mr. Greenewalt outlined his views 
on the role of the individual in the organization. 
"The Du Pont Company’s success over the last 
150 years,” he pointed out, "has come about in 
large part through devoted allegiance to two 
major themes ...
"First, the realization that an enterprise will suc­
ceed only to the extent that all individuals as­
sociated with it can be encouraged to exercise 
their highest talents in their own particular way.
"Second, the provision of maximum incentives 
for achievement, particularly in associating 
the fortunes of the individual to that of the 
corporation.
"Men are not interchangeable parts, like pinion 
gears or carburetors. Individuals differ in ap­
proach and method, and, to perform to best 
advantage, they must never be fettered to ap­
proaches and methods not their own.”
"Conformity" obviously takes a back seat here. 
As Mr. Greenewalt comments, "We conform as 
is necessary to good manners, good relationships 
and the highest use of individual talent. And 
bear in mind that these are strictures on be­
havior, not on creative thought.”
If you find this kind of atmosphere challenging 
it will pay you to explore career opportunities 
with DuPont.

Edgar M. Hoover 
Appointed Director 
Of Economic Study
Three Pittsburgh organizations 
have joined forces to bring a top 
regional economist to the com­
munity to direct an economic 
study of the area and to teach in 
two Pittsburgh universities, as 
announced last week by the Pitts­
burgh Regional Planning Associa­
tion.
Dr. Edgar M. Hoover of Bel­
mont, Massachusetts has been ap­
pointed director of the regional 
economic study to be conducted 
by the Pittsburgh Regional Plan­
ning Association, professor of eco­
nomics at the University of Pitts­
burgh and lecturer in economics 
at the CIT Graduate School of In­
dustrial Administration. His ap­
pointment by the planning associa­
tion is effective February 1, 1959. 
Dr. Hoover is presently visiting 
professor of economics at Har­
vard University and associated 
with the New York Metropolitan 
Region Study.
Valuable Information
Commenting on the appointment 
of Dr. Hoover, William H. Rea, 
president of the Pittsburgh Re­
gional Planning Association said,
‘ We are extremely pleased that 
Dr. Hoover has agreed to under­
take this important project that 
should provide a wealth of valua­
ble economic information for the 
future development of this region.
“Dr. Hoover’s acceptance,” he 
continued, “marks a successful 
conclusion to the first phase of 
the noteworthy cooperative effort 
between representatives of Pitt, 
Tech, the Regional Industrial De­
velopment Corporation and the 
Pittsburgh Regional Planning As­
sociation which will be continued 
throughout the regional economic 
study.”
$400,000 in Grants
The 3-year, $400,000 compre­
hensive study of the economy of 
the Pittsburgh region which Dr. 
Hoover will direct has been made 
possible through a $200,000 grant 
from the Ford Foundation and a 
matching $200,000 grant from the 
Regional Industrial Development
Corporation. These grants were 
announced last September at the 
annual dinner meeting of the Al­
legheny Conference on Commu­
nity Development.
Dr. Hoover, 51, was born in 
Boise, Idaho. He received his un­
dergraduate and doctoral degrees 
from Harvard. Before returning 
there to teach, he was, successive­
ly, professor of economics at the 
University of Michigan, economist 
in the Office of Price Administra­
tion and the Office of Strategic 
Services, and staff member of the 
President’s Council of Economic 
Advisors, the Central Intelligence 
Agency and the Office of Popula­
tion Research at Princeton. He is 
the author of several books and 
articles in this field, including 
“The Location of Economic Activ­
ity.”
General Purposes
General purposes of the long- 
range economic study of the Pitts­
burgh region are: (1) To analyze 
the economy of the Pittsburgh re­
gion; to identify its principal de­
termining elements, especially for 
growth and orderly development; 
to provide a basis for anticipation 
of economic change and informed 
adjustment to it; and, through the 
development of a permanent pro­
cess or institution, regularly 
thereafter to “take the julse” of 
the region’s economy.
(2) To do this in such a way 
that it affords a model for other 
regional communities and so that 
it will relate to similar economic 
analyses, both at the national level 
and in other regions. (3) To ad­
vance the scientific study of re­
gional economics.
