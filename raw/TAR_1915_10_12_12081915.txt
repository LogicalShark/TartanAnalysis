Captain Hines Pleased With Showing.
With the first game of a hard sea­
son but a little over a month away the 
candidates for the ’Varsity “five” are 
rounding into excellent condition 
previous to the closely contested bat­
tles for the varsity positions. Many 
varied combinations are being tried 
by Coach “pro tern” McCullough and 
Captain Hines to find the five that 
work best together as well as the 
best individual skill and strength. The 
squad has been cut and re-divided 
into two squads with different prac­
tice periods to enable Coach McCul­
lough to more closely scrutinize the 
individual play.
For last week Finlay, star halfback 
of this season, has shown considerable 
promise and the qualities that made 
him prominent on the “field” are 
cropping out on the “floor.” Hines 
is ever improving and added to the 
work of former seasons we can ap­
preciate what that means. Henning 
also has added to his work and makes 
a good mate for “Pick.” Tumpane is 
going fast and furious on left forward 
and we look to him for considerable 
of the scoring for the coming season.

The organizations of the Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie School are plan­
ning a large Christmas fair. It has 
been decided to carry out all the 
details of dress, decorations, etc., ac­
cording to mediaeval English cus­
toms. The affair has been localized 
as the Christmas Festival of London- 
town, and will be held Thursday, De­
cember 16, 1915, both afternoon and 
evening, on the third floor of M. M. 
C. S. It is hoped a large number will 
attend, as an excellent opportunity 
will be given to see and purchase 
many of the wonderful things made 
by the students. After the expenses 
have been defrayed the proceeds will 
be given to Charity.
The committees have been at work 
now for some time and a consider­
able amount has been accomplished. 
All the organizations of the school 
will be represented and all taking 
part will be costumed. The decor­
ations will consist of Christmas trees 
and greens and tall, white electric 
candles, making the whole third floor 
a bower of evergreen and sweet 
smelling balsams. Each department 
will have a booth in which the articles 
made in that department will be for 
sale.
The guests will be led in a proces­
sion headed by the Glee Club singing 
Christmas carols, into the Recreation 
Hall when the Dramatic Club will 
present a mediaeval Christmas play.

In the Pittsburgh Press Meet held 
at Duquesne Garden, last Saturday, 
T. A. Griffin, of the P. A. A., suc­
ceeded in equalling the world’s record 
for the 60 yard dash on an indoor 
track. Second was S. Cramer, of In­
diana (6 ft.) with Lyons of Westing­
house Club (3 ft.) third. Griffin’s 
time was 0:6 2-5. Hemman, of Tech, 
took second in his trial heat, but was 
unable to even place in the finals of 
the 60 yard.
One of the feature events of the 
afternoon was the mile run. Quite 
a large number started the race but 
it didn’t take long for the string of 
runners to thin out and before the 
race was half over O. O. Rieser, run­
ning scratch, had taken a position 
among the first few men. H. L. Hird, 
of the P. A. A., (35 yds.) was in first 
place, Rieser, of Tech, second, and 
P. R. Griffins, Westinghouse Club, 
(25 yd.) third. Upon these three men 
the entire interest of the race was 
centered. H. L. Hird seemed to have 
quite a lead over his two followers 
and looked like a sure winner. Grif­
fins, however, closed up and took 
the lead in the last lap. On the home 
stretch, Hird seemed to be all in and 
Rieser passed him by an excellent 
sprint, just in time to cross the line 
second.
In the high jump, R. Haub, of Tech, 
with a 3-inch handicap, managed to 
garner first place by a jump of 6 feet, 
his actual jump being 5 feet 9 inches.

DORMITORY BANQUET.
William N. Espy, a senior mechani­
cal in the School of Applied Science, 
last week, had a narrow escape from 
a six weeks’ trip to Europe in com­
pany with Mr. Henry Ford, the noted 
Detroit peace advocate, and his party 
which sailed for Christiana and Nor­
way on the Oscar II last Saturday af­
ternoon. Mr. Espy had been dele­
gated by a committee of upper class 
officers from the three men’s schools 
to represent Carnegie Tech on the 
Ford peace ship. This election fol­
lowed after the receipt of a telegram 
from Mr. Ford to Director Hamer- 
schlag inviting the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology in conjunction with 
fifteen other leading colleges of the 
country to nominate a man to repre­
sent the school in this American 
peace mission which lately has caused 
so much comment the country over. 
But before the proceedings were 
closed, a telegram was received from 
Mr. Ford’s secretary virtually with­
drawing the invitation. It is gener­
ally felt that this change of front on 
the part of Mr. Ford’s representative 
was due to the fact that the Tech can­
didate was nominated and given his

NEW YORK CLUB SMOKER.
Lively Affair at Hotel Schenley.
On Friday evening, December 3, 
the Carnegie Tech Dorms’ Associa­
tion met in Green Room at the Hotel 
Schenley for their first of a series of 
general good times. Under the able 
leadership of President J. Guter, the 
brave dorm men forced under cover 
a plenteous Dutch lunch, consisting 
of consomme, weiners, potatoes, 
sauerkraut, rolls, olives, dill pickles, 
chow-chow, coffee, ice cream. There 
were many good stories passed from 
table to table and many Tech songs 
floated out to the ballroom. Through 
R. W. Cost, who is always willing 
to help the cause, the services of a 
fine quartette were obtained, consist­
ing of Messrs. Haedencamp and Bob­
by Vey, who were also on the job 
with that Hawaiian stuff. Bobby cer­
tainly can tickle a ukelele. Howard 
Hoffman was also there and told us

Good Program and Gastronomic 
Features.
Amid clouds of smoke, oceans of 
cider, and fields of doughnuts, the 
New York State Club sprang into ex­
istence at a smoker held in the Sci­
ence School Club Room last Satur- 
dav night.
The evening’s entertainment was 
started with a wrestling bout in which 
Alcorn received the decision over 
Lyons in two straight falls. Boak 
and Smullen then boxed a three-round 
^aw amid cheers from the spectators. 
The athletic events were concluded 
when Triesky and Wasson grappled 
ten minutes to a draw decision. Then 
followed a round of song and good 
fellowship such as only New York 
men know how to have.
After the evening’s enjoyment, the 
men got down to business and laid 
plans for the year. The following of­
ficers were elected: President, D. A.
Curtis, vice president, Jack Downes, 
secretary-treasurer, Leland Smith. 
Banquets will be held in various sec­
tions of the state during the Christ­
mas holidays, and a dance will be held

“UNCLE JOHN.”
One thought in particular entered 
our mind after attending the impres­
sive and expressive birthday dinner 
tendered Dr. Brashear two weeks 
ago. That was the infrequencv of his 
visits to us in comparison with for­
mer years.
One of the greatest treasures our 
memory will retain in future time will 
be those too few occasions when we 
have heard “Uncle John” talk or 
have had the honor of shaking him 
by the hand. It is not right that the 
entering class of this year and that 
of last should have had so few op­
portunities to learn to have that same 
affection for one of Tech’s greatest 
friends and the most lovable charac­
ter with whom students of Carnegie 
will ever come in contact.
We urge the deans and the direc­
tor that the privilege of knowing Dr. 
Brashear be not denied the lower 
classmen and that more opportunities 
be given for those informal talks 
which all that heard them so fondly 
remember. They are one of the priv­
ileges received here at Carnegie, 
which would be impossible elsewhere 
and we ask that every opportunity 
be taken to force a common meeting 
ground for Tech men and their most 
loved and honored friend.
WHERE IS YOUR SUPPORT?
Over at the Duquesne Garden last 
Saturday was held one of the largest 
indoor track meets that will be held 
this fall. Perhaps the meet wasn’t 
properly announced by the track man­
agerial staff but there must have been 
quite a number of fellows that knew 
about it. Nevertheless only two or 
three Tech men appeared on the scene. 
Not only at last Saturday’s meet but 
last year when we were racing against 
several big colleges about ten fellows 
.were out to watch, and the same way 
at all the other meets.
The Track Team is one of our most 
successful organizations. We are al­
most always victorious in track events. 
Now the thing is this, why should a 
track man go out and train all season 
from September to June, running ev­
ery afternoon and then get about one- 
fifth as much backing as a man that 
goes out for two months for another 
sport. True, the track man does not 
go out for personal glory. But never­
theless if he works constantly for 
Tech why shouldn’t Tech come out 
and show him some appreciation? The 
track men like all other individuals 
is only human and needs a little en­
couragement. It seems that Track, 
being a major sport, if anything, more 
successful than baseball, should be 
treated as such by the student body 
and that the students should turn out 
to watch the meets and encourage the 
men with rooting.

THE MAIL SYSTEM.
The following letter dwells on a 
factor which is of vital interest to the 
Dormitory students who, under pres­
ent conditions, are compelled to ob­
tain their mail from the school post 
office.
That the system is vogue there is 
far from satisfactory is evident. The 
window is frequently closed for long 
periods and there is no night or Sat­
urday afternoon service. It is evident 
that one over-worked boy cannot 
handle the post office and run errands 
at the same time. We hope that mat­
ters will be remedied before vacation 
time.
Editor, The Tartan.
To the dormitory man, the present 
system of mail delivery never was 
satisfactory, and of late there has 
been no improvement or even evi­
dence shown of attempts at improve­
ment.
Under the present method all dorm­
itory mail is delivered about three 
blocks away from the dormitories, 
and the time when such mail can be 
obtained is limited and decidedly ir­
regular. On school days the distance 
is of little disadvantage and the pres­
ent system would be quite satisfac­
tory were it possible for a fellow 
to obtain his mail when he happened 
to be near the post office.
But the time when most fellows are 
near the Central building, viz: during 
mail hours, the post office may or 
may not be open. In the morning 
and at night it never is, and noon it

WHO WILL COACH BASKET­
BALL? 
Mr. McCullough Assuming Duties At 
Present.
This is the question now when we 
see what a couple of seasons of con­
sistent coaching has done for the foot­
ball and realize that a little of the 
same would greatly raise the efficiency 
of the basketball team. With the 
formidable schedule that is before the 
team we realize that this new oppor­
tunity to enrich the traditions of Car­
negie Tech imposes the new obligation 
of developing the team to its highest 
possibilities. This can be done only 
by immediately deciding upon a coach 
who will use all his sklil, resourceful­
ness and personality towards this ulti­
mate end.
Mr. McCullough is attending to all 
these duties most satisfactorily at the 
present writing and would develop 
the team to this standard if he could 
discard some of his multitude of du­
ties in other fields about the school, 
with the certainty of being able to 
devote the necessary time and effort 
to the team. If he is able to do this 
it will be most satisfactory to all con­
cerned but if he is not it should be 
immediately determined and definite 
arrangements should be made imme­
diately as much can be done before 
the season begins and it is difficult 
for a new man to step in in the middle 
of the season.
We can’t think of any man better 
suited to the position and duties and 
hope that he can continue through the 
year and completely develop his sys­
tem of attack and defense that is sure 
to prove efficient and practical. But 
if this is not possible the school is 
under an obligation to produce a 
coach that the team may live up to 
the expectations aroused and add 
glory to the name of “Dear Old Tech” 
and the ’Varsity “C.”
ELECTRICAL PROSPERITY 
WEEK PARADE.
The Industries School turned out 
over a hundred strong to represent 
Tech in the Electrical Prosperity 
Week Parade on last Wednesday 
night. The Tech men had a prom­
inent position in the parade, being 
just behind the Jovians and in front 
of the Duquesne Light Co.’s section. 
The Tech display and representation 
was under the direction of the Avo 
Club, the members of which were out 
in full force. The members of the 
club showed their ingenuity in the 
construction of the large candle, kero­
sene can, Welsbach mantle, and in­
candescent lamp which formed the 
principal part of the Tech exhibit. The 
first three represented the forms of 
light which are passing out of exist­
ence, and to emphasize this two uni­
formed guards were stationed on each 
side of them, while a large placard told 
the public that they were being exiled, 
and another that they were down and 
out. Each of these three were made 
to seem more real or personified by 
having a man inside of them, and a 
face painted on the outside with a 
disgusted expression on it. After 
these came the incandescent lamp
mounted on a pole, and from the tip 
of the lamp streamers of colored rib­
bon extended, the ends of which were 
carried by as many men, giving it a 
May-pole effect.
Cheerleader, Jack Downs, was on 
the job, and every time the parade 
stopped, and sometimes when it didn’t 
stop, the fellows gave our yells so 
that they could be heard all over town. 
Lots of red and green fire was passed 
around so the Tech section was well 
illuminated while it lasted. The fel­
lows showed lots of spirit in turning 
out, and everybody that saw the par­
ade, and some that only heard it, found 
out what Tech men can do when they 
get a chance.
HENRY HORNBOSTEL, 
ARCHITECT.
An Apostle of the Joy of Living.
Vital interest in persons and events 
usually lend itself to some form of 
expression and the excuse for this 
paper is the interest the Design stu­
dent body has found in the courses of 
lectures, delivered by Mr. Hornbostel.
Like Bernard Shaw, he takes ter­
rible risks; he relies on the intelligence 
and discrimination of his audience.
We find him veiling with a smile 
some of the very grim facts, concern­
ing the beginning of a career, which 
all youths who aspire to “arrive” must 
face—if his auditor has wit enough to 
winnow the grain from the chaff, well 
and good, he finds the sound and sane 
advice of a man among men—a man 
who has “arrived”—who has earned 
the right to dictate to his profession 
and the public in general. He is, in a 
degree, iconoclastic so far as the old 
regimen of educational theories is 
concerned—but then he is construc­
tive also (how could he help it, being 
an architect?) for he builds up idols 
of his own fashioning and worships in 
“temples not made with hands.” One 
of these is the temple of the Imagina­
tion, and here we find him ruthlessly 
sacrificing at its shrine, as ardently as 
any heathen—“commercialism”—“edu­
cational movies”—“soup tickets” (dip­
lomas) and the like—and why? For­
sooth these things are not inspiring 
—they do not raise our feet from the 
clay—they do not cleare the blue— 
they keep the head down. And then 
stern necessity grips this devotee, 
and he snatches from the altar flame, 
Mathematics, and bows his head ack­
nowledging that before it, all men 
must make obeisance (if they would 
become architects).
In these lectures given before var­
ious groups of students on different 
subjects, we find him returning always 
to a central idea—“the stimulation of 
the imagination”—and when he is es­
timating value, this is the first test 
he applies to it as to its usefulness to 
the student. He considers this in­
valuable to the boy and girl and here

MAIL SYSTEM
Continued from Page 2 
is generally closed from 12:30 until 
1:00 or longer, which means that a 
fellow having a late lunch hour must 
wait around ten or fifteen minutes be­
fore getting his mail, or else make 
another trip to the Central building 
at some odd hour.
However, the real difficulty comes 
on Saturdays and other days when 
there is no school. If a fellow works 
he usually has to wait until the next 
school day for his mail or send some 
one else after it—a very unsatisfactory 
arrangement—and if he doesn’t have 
to work he usually must wait any­
where from a half hour up, by making 
one or more extra trips to the post 
office, or waiting there.
At present the outlook for the fel­
lows who will remain in Pittsburgh 
over Christmas and work, is not very 
encouraging, in the matter of receiv­
ing mail. It looks very much as 
though these men will be compelled 
to do without mail during the vaca­
tion.
The splution of the problem is not 
difficult and could be met satisfactor­
ily in several ways:
Lock boxes could be installed or 
some other arrangement made at the 
post office whereby mail can be ob­
tained at any time, or
Boxes could be placed in either of 
the Dormitory club rooms and all 
mail be delivered there by the regular 
postman serving Woodlawn avenue. 
This latter arrangement is the ideal 
one for all, as the natural place of de­
livering mail, according to the com­
mon practice of the United States 
Government, is at the place of resi­
dence—not a quarter of a mile or 
more away.
To the fellow away from home, es­
pecially for the first time, as is the 
case with fully half of the dormitory 
men, the letter from home is an im­
portant thing and any delay in receiv­
ing it, is decidedly annoying, to say 
the least.
Another thing about our postoffice 
that has often bothered many a dor­
mitory man concerns why it is that 
in order to mail a package of any 
kind, he must walk clear over to the 
Oakland station or Liberty Branch. 
Have we really got a postoffice 
branch after all? If so, why not have 
as competent clerks at our postoffice 
as at any station? Instead of hav­
ing youths wholly unmindful of their 
duties,, why not have a MAN there 
who would make it his business to 
give such service as one expects from 
Uncle Sam’s most important depart­
ment.
That the present arrangement is 
unsatisfactory in many ways can be 
vouched for by any of the 180 or so 
men who must depend on it for their 
mail, and it is to be hoped that the 
authorities who have it in their pow­
er to remedy conditions will really do 
something to better them. Whoever 
does so will surely have the heartiest 
thanks of every man in the dormi­
tories.

HOCKEY AND SWIMMING 
TEAM PROSPECTS.
Small Headway Made. Plans As Yet 
Incomplete.
Hockey Team prospects are not 
much brighter at the present time than 
they were at the previous announce­
ment. The Winter Garden has con­
ceded a little in price but still not 
enough to make the project a paying 
one for us. They still demand ten 
dollars per hour and gate receipts. 
However, rumor has it that the Du- 
quesne Garden ice rink may re-open 
and here another chance for the form­
ation of a team presents itself. More 
definite plans will be given in a later 
issue.
Just what developments will occur 
with regard to the Swimming Team 
it would be difficult to predict. The 
use of the P. A. A. tank and good 
material for the developing of a team 
are the all-important elements. Defi­
nite plans will, however, soon be 
known and will probably appear in 
the next issue.
REV. JAMES E. NORCROSS
ADDRESSES Y. M. C. A.
Great Treat To All Who Attended 
Meeting.
Last Sunday’s Y. M. C. A. meeting 
proved to be a real surprise and treat 
to those who attended. The Rev. 
James E. Norcross delivered an ad­
dress which held the undivided atten­
tion of a small but interested audience. 
Time and time again he brought forth 
the fact that we are living in the 
greatest of all countries during the 
greatest of all ages. The previous 
fifty years from the Civil War on has 
been an age of science and invention 
unequalled and a time in which the 
face of the world has undergone 
changes through many wars which 
have re-modeled the geography of 
many countries. The United States, 
and especially the west, he dwelt upon 
as unequalled. The great plains which 
were once considered as useless are 
now being irrigated and will eventu­
ally be the brightest spot in America. 
He termed the plains as “God’s Re­
serve Land.” But getting down to 
the real moral of his speech he gave 
this text, “To whosoever much is giv­
en, from the same, much shall be tak­
en away.” Then he stated that we 
should try our best to do what we 
always think right and to illustrate 
told a very interesting story which 
will always remain in the minds of 
those who heard it. He closed by 
adding that a man should never be 
afraid to admit that he was a Chris­
tian and never be ashamed of his re­
ligion.
Next Sunday’s meeting will be the 
most important one held as yet this 
year, in so far as the constitution and 
by-laws will have been completed by 
the committee appointed for that pur­
pose and it is emphatically necessary 
that as many as possible be there in 
order to have a fair discussion. The 
meeting will be held as usual in 104 
Applied Industries, at 3:15 P. M.

DRAMATIC CLUB HOLDS 
“TAPS DAY.”
Last Monday, about four o’clock, 
a procession found in the basement, 
headed by Miss Marion Pichel and 
Miss Marguerite Menges, who were 
costumed alike in military capes and 
caps. Gradually, as the girls went on, 
more and more followed, till the line 
was quite long indeed. Down one cor­
ridor and up -the other, the proces­
sion slowly made its way, gathering 
recruits. A huge dinner bell being 
rung lustily all the while, and an 
“orchestra” of comb players added 
greatly to the general noise and ex­
citement. Finally, the Recreation 
Hall was reached where a short busi­
ness meeting was held.
Miss Virginia Campbell gave sev­
eral readings which were clever and 
exceedingly well executed. Refresh­
ments in the form of hot chocolate 
and small cakes were served and after 
a social half hour the guests depart­
ed, having first signed a pledge to 
belong to the Dramatic Club and sup­
port it in its work.
REGULAR STUDENT ASSEMBLY
LECTURER IN COMMUNITY 
LIFE.
This week’s lecturer in Community 
Life was Mr. Henry Hornbostel, of 
the School of Design. The subject 
was “The Movies.” According to Mr. 
Hornbostel the movie is a distinct 
good in the community. It fires the
imagination of the child and enter­
tains the middle aged, besides being 
educational in character. Anything 
that stimulates the imagination is 
good for us, and for the child especial­
ly, because he overlooks certain parts 
which might be harmful but sees onl^ 
the adventurous side of it.
The lecture was most interesting 
and gave one an entirley new con­
ception of the use and magnitude of 
the movie. Mr. Hornbostel even 
prophesied within a comparatively 
short time the addition of speech and 
when this is accomplished a great 
stride will have been taken in the 
perfection of the movie business.
M. M. C. S. ALUMNAE TEA.
Dean Breed presided at the regular 
Tuesday Assembly. Several import­
ant announcements, with special em­
phasis on the rule regarding absences 
from class, either directly before or 
immediately after a holiday. Special 
permission must be obtained before 
the time in order not to be fined a 
certain amount for cutting.
Dean Breed also spoke briefly of 
the Carnegie Day exercises, mention­
ing these in particular to which the 
student body as a whole was not in­
vited. The talk closed with a thank- 
you” to those who did anything, how­
ever small, to make any of the enter­
tainment a success.
Miss Pichel made an announcement 
which applied especially tQ members 
of the Guild, but indirectly to all 
M. M. C. S. students. All girls who 
wish to serve lunch between the hours 
of eleven and two on Saturday, De­
cember 11, are requested to hand their 
names to Miss Pichel immediately. 
There are a series of lunches being 
held, one each day of that week, dif­
ferent clubs and organizations taking 
charge, directed by the Western 
Pennsylvania Federation of Women’s 
Clubs. An opportunity has thus been 
offered the Guild to take its place 
with other similar organizations of 
the city, and it is hoped enough girls 
will volunteer in order to make the 
affair a success.
On Saturday, December 4th, the 
Alumnae of the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School held their first tea 
of this year in Recreation Hall. Many 
of the graduates of former years were 
present and it afforded an excellent 
opportunity to renew old acquaint­
ances and greet former classmates. 
Under the leadership of Miss Stoner, 
old school songs were sung, thus 
bringing back more forcibly than ever 
the fact that all still belong to Car­
negie.
The hostess for the afternoon was 
Miss Margaret McQuiston, aided by 
Miss Hilda Reinhold, Miss Marion 
Lloyd, Miss Bess Kelly, Miss Eliza 
Dickey, Mrs. Reta Kempel Denslow, 
and Miss Sara Williams.
The committee is to be congratu­
lated on the excellent way in which 
they performed their duties, thus con­
tributing greatly to the success of the 
afternoon.

Miss Woodruff, who has already done 
a lot in order to make her work suc­
cessful.
INTER FRATERNITY DANCE.
Brilliant as may seem the success 
of Germany, none the less we find 
that the attitude of those present is 
that it has nothing on the success 
with which the Inter-Fraternity dance 
was given. This dance which was held 
at McDougall’s in East Liberty, was 
certainly a success in every sense 
of the word. The Fraternities repre­
sented on last Friday evening were: 
Sigma Tau, Sigma Rho, Beta Theta 
Epsilon, Xi Sigma Upsilon, Zeta 
Lambda Epsilon and the Woodlawn 
Club. All those members of National 
Fraternities who are now studying at 
Tech were also invited.
Each of the above Fraternities ap­
pointed one of their members to rep­
resent them on the committee. This 
committee was composed of the fol­
lowing men: George D. Lain, Karl
H. Fulton, Wallace H. Brown, Arthur 
C. Sprague, Raymond B. Bogardus, 
Andrew M. Stevenson, and Edward
B. Baker, chairman. Much credit 
must be given these men for the fine 
manner in which everything was ar­
ranged.
The programs were very well se­
lected, being in the form of card cas­
es of blue leather with the Tech seal. 
The inside pages were held by 
means of a blue and red cord, repre­
senting Design and Science schools. 
There were twenty-four dances with 
one long intermission, during which a 
nearby sweet shop did a rushing bus­
iness. Excellent and well chosen mu­
sic was furnished by Wm. F. Diehl’s 
orchestra of six pieces.
It was by far the best and most 
successful inter-fraternity dance ever 
given, and will be an annual affair. 
One hundred seventeen couples at­
tended and all expressed having a 
most wonderful time. Patronesses: 
Mrs. John H. Leete, Mrs. E. Ray­
mond Bosange, Mrs. Henry Hornbos­
tel, Mrs. Fred Crabtree, Mrs. Charles
B. Stanton, Mrs. Harry S. Hower, 
Mrs. Allan H. Willet, and Mrs. Al­
bert N. Heyl.
DELTA PHI JOINS WITH XI 
SIGMA.
On December second the former 
Delta Phi members wen; admitted to 
membership in the Xi Sigma Upsilon 
Fraternity. The following pledges 
were then received: J. E. Boler, E. S. 
Kelley, J. S. McFeaters, R. E. Mc­
Cracken, W. H. G. Norman, C. C. 
Wood.
J. Vick O’Brien and J. F. Hitchens 
were admitted to full active fellow­
ship as faculty members.

Special Men’s Dept.
Applied Industries
About 100 students together with 
The Avo Club of the Industries 
School took a prominent part in the 
street parade downtown last Wednes­
day evening, which was held in con­
nection with Electrical Prosperity 
Week.
With Cheerleader Downes present 
the spectators soon learned that Tech 
was right on the job and the next 
morning the newspapers made con­
siderable mention of the splendid 
showing made by the fellows.
At the Assembly Meeting at noon, 
on Wednesday, Mr. C. W. Ward, Supt. 
of the Duquesne Light Co.’s Labora­
tory, spoke to the students on the 
plans made for the parade, especially 
those of the Duquesne Light Co., 
which proved very interesting.
The parade, itself, was one of the 
most spectacular ever held in Pitts­
burgh and the members of The Avo 
Club deserve great credit for being 
there when there is a part to be taken 
in such an event.
Last Saturday morning in Room 104 
of the Industries School, The Pitts­
burgh District Arts Association and 
The State Vocational Department met 
for a general session, about 100 of the 
members being in attendance.
Dinner was served to them at noon 
in the Beanery. The afternoon was 
devoted to individual sessions of each 
of the four sections made up of the 
following: Industrial, Art, House­
hold Economy, and Music.
None of the men in school last year 
failed to express the joy occasioned 
last week when Maguire, formerly a 
student of the printing department, 
stopped off for a few days to renew 
acquaintances before proceeding to 
New York. Mac is traveling for the 
printing trade and his future is well 
taken care of if he continues his busi­
ness career with the same pep and 
life that he had while at Industries. 
The <Bagpipe, the Industries paper, 
first saw light under his guidance and 
its success can only be measured by 
the glad welcome it has had from the 
entire student body.
The Assembly is missing the vari­
ous Teachers’ classes. It is unfortu­
nate that this body has a period 
scheduled just during the time when 
the Assembly is in force, and al­
though direct recommendation has 
not been made to the authorities to 
rearrange the Teachers’ schedule, it 
would be in order to do so. We miss 
particularly such men as Schütz, Mer- 
ker, and the other strong students 
whose assistance is invaluable.
The New York State Club enjoyed 
a very pleasant smoker Saturday 
evening. The Empire State men 
from S. A. I. turned out strongly. 
Jack Downes, our cheerleader, suc- 
cedded to the vice presidency of the 
organization. Beck, Trieski, W. E. 
Murphy, Schiitz, Peters, and a num­
ber of others were present.
The Bagpipe is scheduled for an is­
sue before the holidays. Send your 
contributions to the Bagpipe box.
At the Assembly last Wednesday, 
a Social Committee was appointed to 
develop the social side of the Indus­
tries group. Brownie Liggett and 
Bill Baum are the men in charge and 
under their guidance we hope to start 
the ball rolling.
Some six weeks ago, Roth brought 
up the matter of students being un­
able to get other than fish at the 
Beanery on Fridays and, at the time, 
we were rather skeptical about re­
marking anything concerning that in 
these columns. However, the matter 
was again brought up at the last As­
sembly when Parker called the same 
subject to the attention of the stu­
dents. A motion was carried to re­
quest the commissary department to 
supply both fish and meat.
The Avo Club is to be credited for 
the splendid manner in which its 
members turned out to attend the 
Electric Prosperity Week parade. 
About one hundred men were in line 
and showed up well at the head.
We often wonder why,, in S. A. I., 
there is no club to bring together 
the students of the mechanical trades. 
Soon after the schools were built a 
very flourishing organization existed 
but which long before our time went 
the way of the extinct. Today, the 
electrical department students have 
their Avo Club, one of the strongest 
units of the schools; the Teachers’ 
Club, Night Drafting Club, the print­
ing department organization termed 
The Graphica, and one or two others. 
Neither the Building nor the Machine 
men have an organization whose in­
terest is common to their work and, 
as the time is ripe for creative work, 
it would indeed be well for interested 
and live-wired students to formulate 
some plans for a strong organization.
It may not be just to remark about 
the condition of our club room, but 
just what the trouble is that makes 
ours so undesirable is not easily lo­
cated. It is also the opinion of 
many of us that the location is high­
ly unsuited for the purpose it should 
set forth. The close proximity to 
the entrance makes the Club Room 
nothing more or less than a conven­
ient hang-out. Smoking in the halls 
is very prevalent, due directly to loca­
tion. Student merchants are permit­
ted to spread their wares all over in 
an unsightly manner. Insufficient 
chairs, tables, cuspidors, and practic­
ally everything which should be desir­
able for a club room is lacking. We 
are cramped entirely too much. For 
the enrollment of the Industries Stu­
dent body, a room thrice as large as 
the present one would hardly be am­
ple.
We recall last year the room off 
the hall leading to the printing de­
partment. It was larger than the one 
we now have. Two years ago we 
were given a little room which was 
taken away to provide for an exten­
sion to the Forge Department. Every 
year for the past three we have been 
shifted about. One well ventilated 
room, permanent, spacious and con­
venient, should be allowed the student 
body in which to congregate. Most 
of us are ashamed to enter what we 
term our “Club Room.”

TECH CHRISTMAS CARDS 
SELLING FAST.
The Tech Xmas cards are being 
disposed of at a rapid rate and up 
to last Saturday over 3500 had been 
sold. The cards are being sold for 
the benefit of The Graphica Scholar­
ship fund for a scholarship in the 
Department of Printing. The object 
is to raise $200; the scholarship to be 
given under competitive examination 
and the winner to be decided by a 
board, consisting of Mr. H. L. Gage, 
Dean Connelley and Mr. Alexander 
Hamilton, of Boston.
The cards were designed by Forest 
C. Crooks, a second-year Design 
School student. Mr. Crooks very 
kindly donated his services to the 
cause, thereby saving considerable ex­
pense to the printers. The cards are 
being printed by the students in the 
Department of Printing.
The sale of the Xmas cards has 
been so successful, that a series of 
Easter cards will be printed, the pro­
ceeds of these to be used, also, toward 
the scholarship.

Design School Notes
4••••
The Design School Senate has had 
a busy calendar closing the past week 
and has taken a number of questions 
upon the table. A number, a large 
number, of the underclass students 
are assuming the liberty of eating at 
Senior tables in the “Beanery.” The 
solutiort of this question was thor­
oughly discussed by the Senate mem­
bers and students of the dramatic and 
musical departments should take this 
matter to careful consideration as 
they have assumed more freedom in 
that regard than the representatives 
of any other department.
It is highly gratifying to know that 
the financial obligations assumed as 
a result of the charming Medieval 
Ball can be wholly covered by the 
Design student body together with 
the appropriation given by the school. 
It gives us a vivid example of what 
a little team work will do and what 
we may expect for future revels.
President Green called a special 
Sophomore class meeting last week. 
Business, which demanded the sup­
port of every member of the Sopho­
more class, was discussed but the at­
tendance was not gratifying. Why 
show plenty of “pep” at athletic 
games and matinees but neglect your 
own class meeting? Another special 
meeting has been scheduled for the 
near future and all must attend.
W. H. Eason has resumed studies 
after an attack of typhoid fever. As 
a student body and more particularly 
as classmates we welcome his return. 
“Eas” is one of the boys we can’t do 
without.
Carl Schmidt is still confined by the 
fever. He has been a faithful worker 
and it is with much regret that we 
learn that he cannot return immedi­
ately.
“Creatore “Spigle” led the “Draught­
ing Room Harmonica and Drum 
Corps at a concert last week. A large 
number of selections were artistically 
rendered, the program ending with C. 
C. Pribecks, “Charette Serenade.”
DRAMATIC DRIBBLES.
Since fencing was added to the cur­
riculum, things look bad for Mr. 
Ford’s peace ship around Design. 
Even the girls, who are not admitted 
to fencing classes, retreat to corners 
with wooden foils and while keeping 
one eye on Professor Proscut, they 
make uncertain parrys at unwary op­
ponents.
Students cast for Euripide’s “Hip- 
polytus” are heaving mental sights 
and digging in to put the last touches 
on their tragedy before presenting it 
to an innocent, comedy-loving pub­
lic. This pathetic tragedy following 
so fast upon the heels of “The Fol­
lies” is quite a blow to temperament.
By the way, the “Plebe” dramatic 
class ought to be about ready to pro­
duce “The Bracelet.” After a three- 
months’ rehearsal we expect big 
things.
Everybody in Tech smiled appro­
bation and especially Design girls
when Boston Cream Pie and pork 
chops appeared at the beanery De­
cember 1st.
Drama School entertained Maude 
Adams, Tuesday afternoon, with the 
production of “Tartuffe.” We sure 
appreciate Miss Adam’s visits and to 
prove it this year we gave her a 
lovely corsage of violets, each violet 
expressing our feeling for herself and 
her wonderful acting.
Direction for costume making in 
Social Service Lecture. Prof., “Be­
fore making costume, you must make 
up your mind to dye.”
(Later, taking handkerchief from his 
pocket to illustrate folding of Greek 
costume): “H’m, I must admit, this 
is a rather scanty Greek garment.”HENRY HORNBOSTEL
Continued from Page 2 
is where he finds true value in “mov­
ies,” (not “educational” movies) they 
stimulate the imagination by bringing 
youth into contact with all parts of 
the world, its peoples and their cus­
toms, thus opening up a large field 
for thought. They hold the secret of 
the education of the masses; they 
give them a colossal horizon and mean 
the education of the people at five 
cents per. Thus the “movie” stands 
for a general knowledge of the world 
to those \tho may not travel.
Mr. Hornbostel assumes that we 
are to have some joy out of life and 
says “that anything which inspires 
one to enjoy the beautiful things of 
life is artistic. Something of nature 
without catalogueing: music which we 
may simply enjoy without trying to 
analyze“—in brief, he does not feel 
that we must imbibe morals with ev­
ery draught of art, but takes it for 
granted that swine will always find 
mire wherein to wallow even if guard­
ed in a gilded sty; that as we find the 
gross in every walk of life, it is up 
to the individual whether or not he 
shall rise above the sordid which may 
be found everywhere and live in the 
vibrating light of splendid things or 
in the sombre shadows of doubtful 
pleasures.
Most people whose capacity to en­
joy is great have the same capacity 
for work and we believe Mr. Horn­
bostel is no exception to the rule. 
Also he suggests the surgeon who 
believes in vivisection because of its 
value to mankind; he might not de­
plore the upsetting of a few minor 
ethical notions if this disturbance 
proved a valuable stimulant to the ar­
tistic impulse.
The evident joy he gets out of just 
telling the students how he was asked 
to “fuss up” some of those awful 
bridges designed by “mere” engi­
neers, gives one a vague hint of the 
tremendous interest that he must have 
found in the actual doing of the task.
Someone has said, “You may have 
brains but can you prove it?” Our 
apostle has “made good’’ and Fate 
has been kind in that he lives to look 
upon his most enduring monument— 
the bridges of the Metropolis.
A Student.
Ohio Northern has voted to enter 
the conference believing that it will 
put them in better standing in ath­
letics.
Always Welcome — Riz La Croix
The man who rolls his favorite tohacco in Riz La 
Croix takes pride in the fact that he uses the best 
cigarette “papers” the world produces. And his ciga­
rettes have the fresh, mellow flavor and the rich fra­
grance of the tobacco, without a particle of “paper” 
taste or odor.
(Pronounced: REE-LAH-KROY)
FAMOUS CIGARETTE PAPERS
For a test — light two pieces of cigarette papers, Riz La Croix and some ordinary brand.
Note how much more freely and evenly Riz La Croix burns, with but a faint trace of gray ash —no charring, no odor.
It’s far easier to roll your own cigarettes in Riz La Croix, because it’s thin and light. And being made from pure flax linen,Riz La Croix is unusually strong and perfectly adhe­sive.
Cigarette paper is so small an item of ex­pense that every man can afford the best. Try Riz La Croix.

SCIENCE PLEBE SMOKER.
Science School Notes
SENIOR ELECTRICALS CLEAR 
TRACK.
Help P. R. Co. on Their Way to In­
spect Westinghouse Last 
F riday.
Somewhere between Wilkinsburg 
and East Pittsburgh last Friday af­
ternoon at about a quarter of one a 
big auto truck collided with a bakery 
wagon on the main line of the Pitts­
burgh Railways Company. So it hap­
pened that the Trafford City Special 
which was taking the Senior Electri­
cals out to see the Westinghouse 
Electric and Manufacturing Company 
were stopped on their way.
The truck looked like it was there 
for all day, but this was reckoning 
without a host (Senior Electricals), 
for Professors Dennison marshaled 
his seventeen, who simply took hold 
and obligingly pushed the five ton 
truck up the hill where it belonged. 
Just about the time the truck wasn’t 
going to start, someone wanted the 
chauffeur to take off the brake, but 
the driver assured us that “there were 
no brakes, that was the trouble,’ and 
the ’steen hundred loaves of bread, 
“never touched by human hands,” 
which decorated the surrounding acre 
bore witness that the driver told the 
truth.
Then after General Lee went out 
to get a few loaves after this arduous 
labor, Superintendent “Steve” and 
“Gunboat” of the P. R. Co. gave the 
word and all proceeded to the West­
inghouse.
It was here that we were reminded 
of last year’s Niagara trip for right 
away Professor Dennison started one 
of his walking marathons, which 
would be a credit to Thomas Payne 
Weston.
Of course the fifteen inch shells 
being made out there were supposed 
to be neither seen nor heard, but 
when one passed over the bridge, one 
had to look some place and if your 
eye happened to meet a bunch of big 
shells which looked more like war 
than anything you had ever seen, it 
was natural to wish to inspect the 
electrical equipment of this part 
rather closely; but the guides couldn’t 
be brought to this point of view. They 
don’t talk about this even in whispers 
out there.
The chief of the guides was A. D. 
Moore, one of last year’s electrical 
class; and then several other Tech 
men, among them Dodson, an old 
member of 1916 whose health broke 
down after about two years at Tech, 
were seen at various white collar jobs, 
with the exception of Wildberg, ’IS, 
who was down in the test floor in 
overalls and grimy hands, hard at it.
Half the style of a tailored suit is lost, unless the suit is kept perfectly clean and nicely pressed. We have cleaned and pressed so many ladies’ tailored suits that we have become ex­perts at it, and return your garments so nicely finished as to elicit praise from even the most critical. Send i your suit to us frequently. J. E. T. Shuman, 3911 Forbes St. Adv.
Annual Affair To Be Held in Carnegie 
Union.
The Plebe Class of the Science 
School will give their annual smoker 
to the upper classes Saturday even­
ing, December 11, in Carnegie Union.
Quite a number of novel features 
of entertainment will be giyen. The 
class has secured several reels of "good 
movies for the occasion. Boxing and 
wrestling of a good class is planned. 
In addition a Plebe quartette will ren­
der quite a few selections, as well as 
a number of burlesques on current 
events and athletics.
Those of the class musically in­
clined have banded together into an 
orchestra which will keep things mov­
ing the whole evening. Refreshments 
will be served from the ’’beanery” 
where they will be prepared.
The Plebe class will display for 
the first time their class banner which 
has been made at considerable ex­
pense.
It is the desire of the class that 
many of the upper classmen of the 
Science School are to be present. It 
remains with them to make the 
smoker a success as the Plebes are 
doing their best.
CRUCIBLE CLUB MEETING.
There will be a meeting of the Cru­
cible Club Thursday night, December 
9, in Room 218, at 8 P. M., when Dr. 
Aston, chief in charge of Corrosion 
Research, Bureau of Mines, will de­
liver his lecture on “The Corrosion 
of Metals.” This lecture was recent­
ly delivered before a large atidience 
at Pitt. Dr. Aston has a large lab­
oratory in our Science building where 
he has been carrying on his research 
work. The Sophomore Chemists, 
Metallurgists, and Miners are special­
ly invited to attend. There will be 
eats and smokes.
DORMITORY BANQUET

in his funny way how the old time 
square dances were conducted. Es­
pecial credit is due to the social com­
mittee, with Mr. Ammerman as chair­
man, who so ably arranged things 
that everything went through with­
out a hitch. “Steve” Bowen showed 
us that he can still tickle a piano, 
and Bobby Vey once more brought 
out his old Italian Dry Schlitz cello 
and ably assisted by Mr. Haeden- 
camp rendered a very nice medley. 
At about half past eleven after a fine 
selection from the quartette, the fel­
lows went back to the dorms all 
agreeing that they had had the best 
time ever. At the dorms there was 
an informal stag dance with Mr. Pohl- 
meyer’s Victrola as the orchestra.

No, Philburt, I am not a-arguing with you. 
Fm just a-telling you
—when you want a real smoke, get behind a pipeful of 
Tuxedo and watch all the big and little Worries that 
have been a-besieging you, evacuate their trenches 
and make a rushin’ advance to the rear. Those fragrant 
whiffs of “Tux” make them feel too joyful — no self- 
respecting Worry can stand for that.
The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette
The combination of the best smoking-tobacco leaf in the world and the best method ever discovered for refining and mellowing tobacco puts Tuxedo in a class by itself.
Kentucky’s ripest, mildest Burley leaf, when treated by the original “Tuxedo Process” loses every trace of bite — develops a wonderfully 
pleasing fragrance and flavor that are not found in any other tobacco.
No other manufacturer knows the “Tuxedo Process”; that’s why 
no imitator ever equals Tuxedo!

fîŒfyr ©arta«INVITATION TO PEACE MISSION
Continued from Page 1 
credentials from the student body 
rather than from the trustees and fac­
ulty. At least the same consequences 
followed in the instance of several 
schools where the faculty declined to 
act on the matter of sending a dele­
gate, referring it instead to the stu­
dent body and thus making the com­
mission of sentiment entirely a stu­
dent affair. The details of the inci­
dent are as follows:
On November 29th, Director Ham- 
erschlag received a telegram from Mr. 
Ford’s secretary in New York, invit­
ing a student from this institution to 
join with the representatives of fifteen 
other colleges to accompany him on 
his peace mission to Europe as his 
guest.
As the invitation was not of a na­
ture that could be acted upon by the 
trustees or faculty, and because the 
matter was largely a student one, it 
was referred to the upper class offi­
cers of the three men’s schools for 
action. These officers met on the 
evening of November 30th and after 
discussion voted to accept Mr. Ford’s 
invitation.
Mr. Ford’s secretary was informed 
that his request had not been acted 
on by the trustees or the faculty, but 
that the class officers representing the 
student body had nominated W. N. 
Espy, a senior Mechanical, as a can­
didate for the trip. In reply, the fol­
lowing telegram was received from 
New York:
“Mr. Henry Ford desires me to ex­
press to you his sincere appreciation 
of your very kind response to his re­
quest for a recommendation from 
your University, and to state that ow­
ing to the fact that the accommoda­
tions for students have been reduced 
and that a man has been selected from 
your part of the country, he will not 
be able to avail himself of your very 
kind offer. He trusts, however, that 
in view of the much greater need of 
peace work and the fight against mili­
tarism and military education here in 
America than abroad the situation will 
be materially benefited by the contin­
ued residence and activity of your 
nominee.” Signed, Sincerely yours, 
Louis P. Lochner, Secretary to Mr. 
Ford.BASKETBALL IN LIMELIGHT
Continued from Page 1 
been out regularly but expects to be 
in prime condition for the season and 
to give his competitors a hard run. 
Robertson, Curtis, Green, Slater, and 
Abrams are fighting hard for the for­
ward positions and show excellent 
promise as they all handle the ball 
well, are fast and good scrappers. 
Holzworth, Craig and Werking are 
the contestants for center and are 
going well. Many good men are 
fighting for the guard positions. Kelly, 
Fletcher, and Williams from the foot­
ball line make things very exciting 
when they are on the floor, but there 
are some new men who can make 
things equally interesting and they 
are being watched closely and will 
soon be brought before the public.
Practice is called for every day of 
the week and will soon show results.
The schedule is arranged and is the 
best that we have ever had and all 
that has to be done now is to develop 
the best team that ever ran on the 
“gym” floor to meet it and add to the 
laurels in the same manner as did 
the football team. We have again 
one big object and that is to beat 
“Pitt” and as we’ve been getting 
closer to it every time we expect to 
turn the trick that will effectually 
down our rival from the other hill. 
We’ll need your help, too, and we 
expect the gym to be packed as it 
never was before and the very walls 
to shake with the vehemence of yon*- 
cheering. Support this team as you 
did the other and watch the results— 
they will be most gratifying as well as 
profitable.
PRESS MEET AT THE GARDEN
Continued from Page 1 
Haub, a new man, displayed excellent 
form and appears to be another Jack 
King. Creighton, of Indiana Normal 
(4 in.), took second with Lott, P. A. 
A. (1 in.), third.
In the two-mile relay P. A. A. had 
very little trouble in defeating West- 
inghouse Club. P. A. A.’s first team 
came in ahead, with their second team 
second and Westinghouse last by over 
a lap.
Besides these events there were 
many junior events, all of which in­
spired great interest among the 
younger spectators.
BASKETBALL SCHEDULE
Continued from Page 1
There you are and now you see why 
the team is working so hard to put 
us on the map throughout this State, 
New York and the East. These games 
promise to be the most interesting 
that ever took place on the school 
floor and abroad. Special arrange­
ments for seating will be made to ac­
commodate the large crowds that are 
sure to be present at the home games. 
Before the Westinghouse and Pitt 
games the second or Freshman teams 
will play preliminaries. After the 
game there will be the usual “dancing” 
which will be made better than ever. 
So here you are and you realize you 
will have to get there early to get a 
seat.
The “Reserves” will have a separate 
schedule with the various leading 
high schools in the near vicinity and 
while the ’Varsity is touring New 
York the Reserves have a trip through 
this part of the State and Eastern 
Ohio. This experience is sure to de­
velop splendid ’Varsity material for 
the coming teams which must be al­
ways kept in mind.
This schedule lacks six games of be­
ing as long as last year’s but the 
games are with better schools and 
will be more nearly a possible one to 
allow the team to do its best at all 
times without being in danger of the 
hospital. Last year’s schedule was 
a difficult one, but as all things must 
be developed this year’s schedule is 
an advance along this line as future 
rchedules will show an advance over 
this one.
