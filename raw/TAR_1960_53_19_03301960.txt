Tech on Tuesday, March 22, narrowed the field of twelve 
nominees to: Bonnie Grove, repre-*

backed by the Tri-Delts; Cindy 
Scott, C tower’s sophomore nomi-

Grand March 
Meanwhile, ftnal plans for the 
Military Ball itself are nearing 
completion. The dance will get 
under way at 9 p.m. this Saturday 
night in the Georgian Room of the 
Hotel Webster Hall with the Bill 
^Roy Orchestra providing the 
music. At 11 p.m., the ceremonies 
for the crowning of the queen will 
start. The queen and her court 
will also receive at this time hon­
orary rank in the cadet regiment. 
Immediately after the coronation 
will be the Grand March. At the 
end of the March, the queen and 
her escort will lead off the danc­
ing, which will continue, with a 
^puse for a balloon drop at mid­
night, until 1 a.m.
Attendance Hinted 
Carnegie Tech’s ROTC students 
are reminded that attendance is 
not compulsory, but the severity 
of inspections for the next few 
weeks will hinge on attendance. 
Accordingly, tickets are still avail­
able from any Scabbard and Blade 
member.

Scotch And Soda’s 
Musical Director 
Is Dave Stock
Although music was Dave 
Stock’s hobby, his first year at 
Tech was spent in E & S as a 
physics major. He switched to 
music and is now a junior study­
ing composition. He is a commu­
ter and a veteran of Scotch ’n 
Soda shows.
In his freshman year, Dave 
worked at arranging. Then he 
branched out and became a trum­
peter, rehearsal pianist, copyist, 
and arranger.
When asked about “Pn the 
Rocks,” Dave replied, in the words 
of the late great Wolfgang Am- 
odeus Mozart, “It swings.” He 
commented on the 17 piece band, 
the chorus, and the orchestration, 
saying they were “the best in sev­
eral years.”
Review With Continuity
Although the show is a review 
and has no story line, it has con­
tinuity. Some sketches are parod­
ies, such as one. on a “famous man 
on campus.” Much of the music 
is jazz, although the music is so 
diverse that it could only be found 
on the Tech campus. Among the 
selections will be calypso, ballads, 
a take-off on rock ’n roll, and one 
on the beatnick world with poetry 
and jazz. Some unique instru­
ments will be used for interesting 
effects. Some of these are the re­
corder, an ancient version of the 
flute, and a flugelhorn — no, you 
read it correctly — as well as two 
bassoons.
Two unusual dances will be re­
presented, “the world’s only 
Chinese jazz ballet,” to quote Mr. 
Stock, and a Jewish frailach. The 
show will last approximately two 
hours, and the many people con­
nected with the show are re­
hearsing and arranging ever> 
night.

Sheets for activities points to­
ward activities keys and awards

Travel Office 
Gives Service
The purposes of the newly 
opened Carnegie Tech Travel Of­
fice is to provide faculty, staff and 
students with an on-campus res­
ervation service including: plane, 
ship, bus, and train tickets; rent- 
2sy2o service; hotel and resort res­
ervations; and charter arrange­
ments for group transportation. 
The office is in Administration 
Hall 239A and office hours are 
eow, 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Mon­
day through Friday. From 9:00 
2g,g Aw 3:00 p.m. daily, arrange 
ments can be made by phoning 
Mcg 1-4210. The on-campus tele­
phone extension is 206. Reserva­
tions and the services of Tech 
Travel are provided without 
charge except where long distance 
phone calls wo extraordinary Th—
penses are incurred. These will WT

Patterns Staff 
In Full Swing
Many students are helping to 
support the new Tech literary 
magazine, “Patterns.” The art and 
literary staff of the magazine are 
now sorting out the work of stu­
dents who have contributed writ­
ing or art work. They have re­
ceived a large quantity of poetry, 
some short stories, and three 
critical essays. However, they 
have gotten no photographs, and 
art work from only a few people. 
Although the last day that articles 
can be submitted is Sunday, April 
3, Leila Moore, the editor, says 
that they are still hoping to get 
more short stories, essays, photo­
graphs, and art work.
Small Sales
Patterns was originally to ap­
pear around Spring Carnival, but 
because of printing complications 
the date has been changed to the 
middle of May. Printing costs are 
high, and the magazine only has 
a budget of $1000. Since the staff 
has estimated that they will only 
be able to raise about $500 
through sales, it is likely that Pat­
terns will contain advertising in 
order to balance the rest of the 
costs. Sales so far are low; only 
100 copies have been sold. But 
they feel that most people will 
buy the magazine after it has been 
published.
Size Determined
Even though they have not con­
tracted a printer, the Patterns’ 
staff has decided upon the form of 
the magazine. It will be seven by 
ten inches in size and will be 
bound with a hard paper cover. 
There will be only one column 
per page, and the whole magazine 
will contain approximately 32 
pages.
Anyone still wishing to submit 
a work s!#ould send it to Box 363, 
CIT post office. It is necessary 
that we student* help support 
Patterns. For a long time Tech 
has needed a literary magazine.
Candidates For
Degrees
Candidates for degrees in June 
are reminded that the card re­
questing engrossing information 
for the diplomas must be re­
turned to the Registrar’s office at 
onee. This applies to both sen­
iors and graduate students.
Also, the $10 graduate fee is 
payable by April 1.

Beaux Arts Ball To Be Held 
At End of Fine Arts Week
It’s official! There will be a Beaux Arts Ball this year 
at the conclusion of the planned Fine Arts Week.
These functions will jointly represent the only all Fine 
Arts events of the school year. Some difficulty was encoun­
tered in scheduling the activities^ 
due to conflicting functions, but 
the final date for the Ball has been 
set at Saturday night, April 30, 
from 9 to 1 in the lobby and grand 
foyer of the Fine Arts building.
The week immediately preced­
ing the Ball will be set aside as 
Fine Arts Week. The purpose of 
this time is to inspire student in­
terest throughout Carnegie Tech 
via displays. Accordingly, Fine 
Arts students will set up displays 
all over the campus pointing up 
both the work they are doing and 
the excellent cultural opportuni­
ties within reach of all students.
Old Custom
Because it is an old custom for 
artists to have a ball following 
some great undertaking or ac­
complishment, Fine Arts - Week 
will end with the Beaux Arts 
Ball. This gala affair is ' the 
following some great undertaking 
or accomplishment, Fine Arts 
Week will end with the Beaux 
Arts Ball. This gala affair is the 
reincarnation of a yearly Beaux 
Arts Ball at Tech. The last was in 
’54 — The Bal Bleu — referring 
to its theme which was the color 
blue. This year, the theme is 
“Once Upon a Time.” a theme 
likely to inspire a variety of 
mythological and legendary cos­
tumes. The best male and female 
costumes will reign over the Ball 
as, respectively, King and Queen 
of Beaux Arts. Those without cos­
tume, masks, and makeup, includ­
ing faculty, will not be admitted.
In true Beauz Arts fashion, 
couples are to be discouraged at 
the Ball. However, a maximum of 
two tickets are available to each 
Fine Arts student to allow for 
those who prefer this distinction.
Students other than Fine Arts will 
be admitted, but only when paired 
with a Fine Arts student.
46Asian Images”
To Be the Next 
M. Falk Lecture
The Maurice Falk Lecture Ser­
ies on “International Relations” 
will present its next lecture pro­
gram, “Asian Images of America,” 
during the second week of April.
The guest speaker for this pro­
gram is Dr. Norman D. Palmer, 
professor of Political Science at 
the University of Pennsylvania. A 
noted authority on United States 
foreign relations, Dr, Palmer has 
traveled extensively in the Far 
East, has served as consultant to 
the Foreign Operations Admini­
stration, and since 1954, has acted 
as Coordinator of the University 
of Karachi Project, sponsored by 
the University of Pennsylvania.
The lectures will be presented 
on April 12, 13, and 14 in Porter 
Hall 100 at 2:00 p.m. Following 
each lecture there will be a semi­
nar held in AH 246A for all those 
interested. Dr. Palmer's three lec­
tures are entitled, in order of pre- 
sentation, “America Through 
Asian Eyes,” “The American Im­
pact on Asia,” and “The Asian 
Response, and Its Implications for 
United States Policy.”

the United Nations Children’s 
Fund, twenty per cent to the Na­
tional Scholarship Service and 
Fund for Negro Students, five per 
cent to the American Cancer So­
ciety.
I think really my function is 
just to remind you that this is 
Campus Chest time. Then I am 
done: 1 have reminded you. I 
don’t think you need to be ex­
horted to “Give ’till it hurts.” A 
better rule of thumb, perhaps, is 
to give ’till it feels good.
Magoo Frolic 
Open To All
The Film Arts Society, in an­
swer to many requests, is this 
week giving “the campus what it 
wants.” The society is sponsoring 
a festival of the best Mr. Mag«^ 
cartoons to be presented this Fri­
day and Saturday in Porter Hall 
100.
It became apparent to those in 
the society, through many written 
appeals, that a large number on 
the Tech campus wished to see the 
best works in contemporary ani­
mation: Mr. Magoo. Because the 
society could not devote on? of its 
regular sessions to such a program 
this year, it was decided that 
special program ’ be scheduled, 
open to the entire campus. Hence, 
this weekend will see two hilar­
ious evenings in Porter Hall 100 
devoted to the best Mr. Magoo 
cartoons ever made: a galaxy of 
highly amusing sophisticated and 
satirical humor, seldom seen on 
this campus at one time.
Award Winners
The program will feature Ma­
goo in many of the roles whi4J‘ 
won for him the Academy Award 
and many international honors. 
There are twelve in all; techni­
color greats in the world of the 
contemporary cartoon.
The special “Magoo” showings 
are in no way connected with the 
present series of the Film Arts 
Society. This is a special event of 
which the entire campus is invit­
ed. Admission is fifty cents and 
showings are in Porter Hall 
7:30 and 9:30 p.m. on April 1 and, 
2.

the pflay-offs the favorites were 
seeded. GSIA, KS, Englishmen, 
ATO in that order were given first 
round byes.
First Round:
In the upper bracket, with GSIA 
awaiting the winner, it was'SAE 
over BTP by 31-27 as Connell’s 9 
points for the losers were offset 
by Corell’s 11 for SAE. 
{sAmmediately following that 
¿¿mne the Falcons took on PKT 
and came out on the long end of a 
57-39 score. Grummer and Lud­
wig netted 19 and 18 points for 
the winners, while Pifer dropped 
in 18 po'nts in a losing cause. The 
Falcons found the Englishmen 
awaiting them in the quarterfinals.
In the lower bracket DTD fell 
before an always hustling TDP 
aggregation by 58-33. TDP’s depth 
jved too much as Perlemuter 
Hollander collected 13, Roth- 
enberg 12, and Wolf son and Yab- 
lon contributed 10 points to the 
cause. Thus the Tau Delts earned 
the right to advance against ATO.

and Bouxein with 14 and 9 points 
apiece. High-scoring Sharkey con­
tinued to pace PKA (as he had 
done all season), but his 15 point 
effort was not enough. SN could 
now deliver their surprise pack­
age to KS in the quarter-finals.
Quarter Finals
In the upper bracket the fancy- 
shooting Englishmen took the Fal­
cons to task by 68-42. With Tra- 
geser back to lead the attack with 
25 points the boys in green found 
a potent offense amply supported 
by Rolnik, Beisler and Phillips 
chipping in 13 points apiece. The 
Falcons, paced by Adams with 19 
and Ludwig with 12 tried to keep 
up but couldn’t cope with the 
high flying Englishmen. Down 25- 
23 at half-time the Falcons were 
outscored 13-4 in the third period 
and 30-15 in the final period.
Meanwhile, GSIA was having 
little trouble with SAE. With Patz 
dominating the boards and Benner 
and Corrigan handling the scor­
ing, GSIA rolled up a 27-11 half- 
time lead and coasted to the vic­
tory. Corrigan ended up with 12 
and Benner 11 to easily offset 
Corell’s 14 points for the losers.
In the lower bracket ATO, 
down 18-13 at half time, stormed 
back to down TDP 42-30 and ad­
vance to the semi-finals. The ag­
gressiveness and scoring punch 
of Poad and Valentine with 18 and 
10, respectively, proved too much 
for the Tau Delts, whose attack 
died in the second half.
The other lower bracket contest 
saw the first upset of the tourney 
as the much vaunted KS attack 
never got started and hustling SN 
rolled to a 39-33 win. KS led 16- 
12 at half time but saw this lead 
vanish and at the end it was near­
ly a matter of holding the ball 
and converting fouls for SN to 
preserve the victory.
Semifinals:
The semi-finals games on the 
big court proved to be real cliff- 
hangers. In the upper bracket, the 
underdog Englishmen fought down 
the wire to down GSIA by 32-32

on a foul shot in the closing sec­
onds. Tied at halftime 17-17 and 
down 28-27 at the end of the third 
period, the Englishmen held close 
as Beisler netted 13 and Roloik 
11 points. GSIA’s attack was built 
mainly around Petran with 17 
points on driving layups. The big 
future of the game, however, was 
the hustle of the Lineys to hold 
their own on the boards with tall­
er GSIA. Tim Wilson and A1 
Rolnik did a beautiful job on the 
boards and it was Rolnik who tied 
the game in those final seconds 
when he sank the clutch foul shot 
which won the game.
In the lower bracket ATO had 
to go 11 out to down SN 48-47 as 
Poad with 20 combined with 
Grebo’s 13 to offset Bouxein net­
ting 16 and Garrett with 14. ATO 
had to beat off SN rallies repeat­
edly as SN came back after from 
9-12 point deficits. At the end of 
the third period it was ATO by 
42-34 which is an indication of 
the way SN kept hanging on. The 
game featured some fancy shoot­
ing from both sides, mostly from 
the outside from whence the 
games’ top scorers were bambing 
the nets. Action tensed in the final 
seconds when SN had time for
final shot, but the five defense of 
ATO forced a long set which fell 
short. It sent ATO into Intra­
mural night against the English­
men for the championship.
Consolation Game:
The third place play-off sent a 
vengeful GSIA against a SN team 
that had used up all its gas and 
was playing without the services 
of high scoring Garrett. The de­
cision was never in doubt as GSIA 
led 39-8 at halftime and rolled to

Sigma Nu Wins Wrestling Title, 
ATO Finishes A Strong Second
On Monday, March 14, and Wednesday, March 16, the 
Sigma Nu wrestling team again showed their superiority in 
the intramural wrestling competition. Paced by veterans 
Charley Crowder and Skip Sprenkle, and newcomer, Marty 
Ackerman, they rolled up a respectable 28 points, which was 
10 more than their nearest rival, ATO. BTP was third with 
13 points and KS was close behind with 11. The matches went 
like this:
Lightweights
In the 130 lb. class, Ackerman 
(SN) and Paul Bosik (SN) who 
each gained first round byes, were 
matched against each other. Ack­
erman pinned his game opponent 
after one minute and sixteen sec­
onds had elapsed.
In the 140 lb. class, Bill Ander­
son, (BTP) pinnec1. Phil Myers, 
and Mike Aaron (BTP) pinned 
Bob Lindsay. In the final, Aaron 
pinned Anderson with 3 minutes,
28 seconds gone.
The hardest fought matches took 
place in the 150 lb. class where 
Charley Crowder (SN) outpointed 
Guy Mellick, 4 to 1, and Phil Metz 
(SAE) pinned Bob Nowak. The 
best match of the finals saw the 
experienced Crowder squeak past 
Metz, a promising freshman, by 
the score of 4 to 3.
Middleweights
The 160 lb. class saw Dick Dei 
(KS) outpoint Fred Klingener and 
Dave McCray (KS) pin Bob 
Brown. McCray won the final 
with a bye.
In the 165 lb. class final, How­
ard Steve’' (ATO), who pinned 
Ken Simonetta, pinned Lloyd Fa­
gan (SN). Fagan had outpointed 
Howie Waugh in the preliminary.
The 170 lb. class saw Gary Bell 
(ATO) outpoint Tom Summer- 
villte and John Weyer (ATO) pin 
Bob Coulson in the semifinals. 
In the final, Bell won by a pin 
after 1:26 had elapsed.
Heavyweights
In the 180 lb. class, Gary 
Schwerzler (SN) pinned Bill 
Kraynek and Ken Sutherland 
topped Bill Gilfillan. Sutherland, 
who put on a one-man show for 
Deljta Upsilon pinned Schwerzler 
with 3 minutes showing on the 
clock.
Finally, in the unlimited class, 
Sprenkle (SN) pinned Tony Smith 
and Ron Hurbanek (KS) pinned 
Don Menti. Then the burly Spren­
kle proceeded to pin Hurbanek. 
Except for a few consolation
matches, this concluded the action 
on the mats.
The team orders looked this 
way.

Tech All-Stars 
In Tournament
A team of all-school basketball 
players, mid- season selections, 
represented Tech in the St. Vin­
cent Invitational Intramural Tour­
nament on Saturday, March 12. 
Due to traveling circumstances, 
Tech was seeded so that their 
first game was a semi-final.
We lost this first game to St. 
Vincent to eliminate us from win­
ning the championship. Getting 
adjusted to the floor was the big 
problem the team faced. By half- 
time, everyone appeared relaxed; 
but we trailed by nine points. In 
the second half, a new team de­
fense was employed and the score 
was narrowed to a three-point 
deficit. With the score 36-30, in 
St. Vincent’s favor, and four min­
utes left in the game, the opposi­
tion got red-hot while we stood 
still. The final score was 56-40, 
and the only good thing we could 
speak of was Patz’s rebounding.

an easy victory. Maddrey netted

Championship:
An overflow crowd watched a 
thriller and saw’ a come-from-be- 
hind victory for the Englishmen 
over scrappy ATO. Down 24-14 at 
halftime the Englishmen were 
listless /hile ATO was sharp and 
smooth. Another upset seemed in 
the offing when at the end of the 
third period it was still ATO by 9 
at 33-24. Poad ana Valentine were 
running a smooth attack that at 
one time had a 13 point lead at 
33-20. However, in the final 8 
minutes it was all Trageser and 
the Englishmen. Trageser drove 
continually and converted the in­
evitable fouls with help from Rol­
nik, pumped life into the inspired 
Englishmen. The big tie came at 
40-40 and two field goals iced the 
game for the independents since 
ATO then converted a three point 
play. In the end it was Trageser 
with 19, Beisler and Rolnik with 
8 each, Phillips with 7 and Wilson
with 2 points for the winners. ®c 
ATO, Valentine netted 15, Poad 8, 
Debos 7, Grebos 6, Eisenhower 5, 
and Johnson had 2 points. It was 
a beautiful game, indicative of the 
type played by the accomplished, 
experienced basketball players on 
many teams 'n 1960.

For if you dig a modern filter cigarette 
It figures that it’s what’s up front that is the most 
Like pure Flavorsville, orbit stuff, and all that jazz;
And only Winston swings with 1 FILTER-BLENP] up front,
A real gone combo of golden, rich tobaccos 
Selected and processed like for filter smoking;
That’s why, dear cats or even squares, it’s understood
Winston tastes good like a cigarette should !
