FRESH AIR VS. GROUCH.
Four months are now beginning in 
which the average Student is prone 
to neglect his exercise.
The time is come when baseball, 
golf, tennis and football are virtually 
impossible leaving only hockey to sur­
vive among the more important out 
door sports. Even hockey is out of the 
question with those who do not skate, 
and for the most of us, exercise is now 
at an end until the thaws of April 
make it comfortable to exercise in the 
open.
Yet the abandonment of the sources 
of strength for almost one-half of the 
year is a serious mistake. No indoor 
exercise can equal in benefit muscular 
action in the open air.
There are few better forms of exer­
cise than walking, and walking is a 
possibility for every Tech man. There 
are four cardinal rules for getting re­
sults from it.
1. Walk fast. There is no profit 
whatever in slouching along.
2. Make the exercise regular. Two 
hours a day will accomplish wonders in 
keeping down doctor’s bills.
3. Dress for walking. Don’t wear 
an overcoat, for it impedes the legs. 
Don’t mind being a little chilly at the 
start of a "walk on a cold morning.
4. Breathe deeply. Every time you 
' take a big draught of air through your
nose and let it filter through your lungs 
you are getting for nothing the best 
medicine.
The students of Margaret Morrison 
School have formed a Perambulation 
Club: it may be possible for the male students to secure membership, I am 
not certain, however. This I do know, 
if the student body will take more ex­
ercise we can reduce that fast increas­
ing sick list to a minimum.
UNIQUE EXPERIMENT IN TECH­
NICAL EDUCATION*
•GO h-' t]r*‘ t.' • •• <
e.b cnl lit*, oilThe following article is an excerpt 
from one Which appeared recently in 
The Tron Trade Review.
At the University of Cincinnati an 
experiment is being made in the form 
of a co-operative course. Under this 
system, the students work alternate 
weeks in the shops of the city and at 
the University/ In mechanical en­
gineering for instance, the student 
works one week at the shop, the next 
at the university, and so on, his work 
in the shop being the regular ap­
prentice employment of every young 
man who intends to become a ma­
chinist. The course is six years in 
length, during which time all the sub­
jects taught in the regular four-year 
course ar^ given in an intensified form. 
At the end of this time the degree of 
mechanical, chemical or electrical en­
gineer is conferred, as the case may 
be.
The greatest advantage by far to the 
co-operative student arises from the 
fact that he is working almost continu­
ously with all sorts and conditions of 
men, from the laborer and the “handy­
man” to the superintendent and gen­
eral manager. It is to be expected that 
during this period of time he will learn 
a great deal about the mental attitude 
of the laborer toward the employer and 
about the position assumed by labor 
organizations toward the problem of 
production, to say nothing of the 
knowledge which he will obtain of the 
petty tricks, rivalries and jealousies 
which go to make up the social life 
of the average shop. Of all this the

TECH IS BADLY BEATEN.
Last Friday evening our boys ran 
up against a good thing in the collec­
tion of “old timers” and “has beens” 
(?) known as the Interscholastic Hock­
ey Team. The name is very mislead­
ing as only about one-half the team 
are at present attending school; but 
Dick Guy has ;seen fit to have it so 
called. Our friend, Reisfar, was in uni­
form for the Interscholastics but, hap­
pily, he did not play. Tech had two 
new men in the game, McCandless and 
Close, and neither of these men wrere 
able to do their best work owing to 
extreme nervousness. But Donehoo, 
whom everyone expected to play a star 
game, failed miserably at goal. It does 
not seem right to “knock” the mem­
bers of our team, who have done good 
work in the past, but, if they can not 
let certain things alone during the 
playing season, well—you know the 
rest.
The opposing team succeeded in 
landing four goals in eacu. half due 
to the speedy playing of their forwards* 
especially Bright and Robinson. Once 
in the second half Patterson attempted 
a grandstand play “all by his lone­
some” which resulted in a fluke. This 
was the only time that the Inter­
scholastics failed to use their team 
work. The game was rough as usual 
and Ahl and Overend were not far in 
the rear in this respect. Referee 
Smith apparently had no eyes'for their 
roughness, but Tech escaped him only 
once or twice. Dowling, Adams, Ma­
son and Charles played their usual star 
game, but were hampered by the poor 
work of the rest of the team. Per-

fcur-year student is practically ignor­
ant when he leaves college, and it has 
been the constant complaint of em­
ployers that college graduates are in 
no wise equipped to deal with that 
phase of shop management which con­cerns the employe.
It is believed that this system of edu­
cation will furnish to the manufacturer 
a man skilled both in theory and in 
practice, and free from defects concern 
ing which so much complaint is made. 
It is not held, of course, that this 
method of training will supply full 
•fledged engineers, aged 23 years, or 
there abouts, but it is believed that it 
will provide a better preparation, a 
stronger foundation, for the successful 
practice of engineering. The qualifica­
tions wThich the engineering graduate 
should possess will be more nearly ob­
tained. He will be just as thoroughly 
grounded in the fundamental prin­
ciples of science as he is under present 
conditions, but he will have greater 
facility in applying men to practical 
problems. He will be mucn more high­
ly specialized but not at the sacrifice 
of fundamentals. He will become fa­
miliar with business methods by con­
stant contact with business conditions, 
supplemented by class room instruc­
tion and practical talks on business 
law. He will obtain a knowledge of 
men in his gradual rise through the 
various departments of the co-opera- 
tion plants. The cultural part of his 
education will be planned to make him 
a man of good address and sympathies.And, finally, a combination of these 
conditions will teach him to do his best 
naturally and as a matter of course. 
It will start him on his life work with 
a symetrical and uniform* fundamental 
development of his engineering, his 
business and his social parts, a de­
velopment which will continue evenly 
and make him a skilled engineer, a 
safe business man, and a broadly 
tolerant and intelligent citizen.

PIONEER TECH SMOKER.
On last Saturday evening the mem­
bers of the Pioneer Tech Club tendered 
those students who reside at the Wood- 
lawn Cottage a smoker at the Pioneer 
Club House. The rooms were tastily 
decorated with college banners, con­
spicuous among which were the Car­
negie and Pioneer pennants. The or­
chestra rendered several numbers 
which were well received and later in the evening Messrs. Ketter and Field 
sang a duet which brought forth tre­
mendous applause.
The best of good fellowship prevail­
ed and many incidents of last year’s school life were exchanged.
At twelve o’clock the visitors gave a 
yell for Pioneer Tech and went home 
amid the cheers for Woodlawn Cot­tage.
---------o---------
TRADE SCHOOL.
Prof. Connelly, the busy head of the 
Trade Schools, intends there shall be 
more sociability between the students 
in his scattered sections and with that 
aim in view, he is having the various 
classes meet once a week in the as­
sembly room and discuss all sorts of 
topics most likely to reach the de­
sired result. If the men but realize 
the great benefit they can derive from 
such gatherings, Prof. Connelly’s wish 
will be more than fulfilled.
---------o---------
FACULTY RULING.
A student is expected to be present 
at all scheduled exercises.
A student who is irregular in at­
tendance will be warned by the Regis­
trar and four un-excused absences in­
curred after that warning will drop 
him from his class.
1910.
In last week’s issue of the Tartain, 
announcement was made of the con­
cert to be given by the Glee and Man­
dolin Clubs, in Carnegie Music Hall, on February 1st.
Here is a good opportunity for 1910, 
to show their appreciation for the hard 
work these clubs have done.
It takes no little escort to come out at times, other than school nights; and 
stay until 10 o’clock or ^1 o’clock, prac­
ticing, and getting in shape to give first 
class concerts, for no other cause than 
loyalty to our Alma Mater; and so it 
is up to all the students to come out 
and give the boys a good send off.
Tickets can be obtained from any 
member cf either the Glee or Mandolin 
Clubs.

At a meeting of the delegates of the 
Athletic Association held January 14, 
1907, the following officers and commit­
tees were elected to serve during the 
coming year:Chairman. Prof. Keller: vice chair­
man, Henderson. ’08 (Day); secretary,

Financial Committee—Tarn, ’10 (Ap­
plied Science, Night): Steen, (Applied 
Design. Day); Pobt. Parsons, ’08 (Ap­
plied Science, Day).
Mr. Bear, who had charge of the 
meeting during the absence of Pres. 
Krebbs, gave a fitting tribute to Freh- 
see, the retiring chairman of the Man­
agement Committee, as to the abilitv 
^isplaved in the managing: of the af­
fairs of the Association during the past 
year. Mr. Frehee has worked under 
difficulties, having scarcely auv avail­
able fund«. Without being able to get 
a line on his football candidates and no home grounds he arranged a football 
schedule which included games with 
some of the larger and more prominent tea'ns in this pectinn of the state.
Mr. Freheee and the rest of the com­
mittee deserve a vote of thanVs from 
each class for their untiring efforts to

that he lives so far away from school. 
He would be a valuable addition to the Dramatic Club.

ers. But, “it’s an ill wind that blows 
no one good,” so the druggists and doc­
tors should be duly grateful to our 
embryo poets.
A word to contributors to the Tar­
tan. Revise your work a little more 
carefully and you will perhaps under­
stand its non-appearance.
The ouality of matter submitted by 
the night classes should show a mark­
ed improvement with* the introduction 
of another English period.
1911 is particularly proud of the

He, Mr. C. E. Morrison, has been 
chosen to fill a position of trust and 
importance in the Athletic Association, 
and that he will fill it to the satisfac­
tion of all is the modest prophesy of 
his classmates.
“It” is to be found on Lonergan's 
upper lip. We all wondered why he was ashamed to stand in the hall sell­
ing Tartans.
The athletic committee of 1911 ought 
to remember her gridiron heroes by 
posting a notice that the following will 
be awarded numerals whether it goes 
any farther or not.
The social committee of ii>ll is not 
going to hold a dance in January as 
was “threatened” in a December issue 
of the Tartan. The iacilities, condi­tions and incidentally, the faculty, 
were found to be unfavorable.
Kirk, of 1911, drove a pin, of ordi­
nary length, into his thigh the other 
day and Hess said, “Turn around Kirk, 
and let me see if it didn’t come clear 
through.
January is surely the month for 
remnants. We have been getting all 
the odds and ends of 1906 weather ir­
respective of season or style.

A WILLING PUPIL.
Her poor Suitor did not discern That her gowns cost more than he’d 
earn.Said she, “How could you dress me?” 
He blushed and said, “Bless me! That’s something I think I could 
learn.” —Life.
“Like” Stanford of the Carnegie Tech School visited his parents during 
the Christmas holidays. [Copied from 
the Cambridge Springs Bugle.]
Last Friday afternoon the Mechani­
cals received quite a treat in the pat­
tern shop. Messrs. Phillips and Kohler 
gave a lecture on stresses of materials 
used in the construction of a buz 
[ wagon. The lecture was profusely il­lustrated by means of parts of machine 
i that have been tested by compression, 
tension, shock and telephone pole. The 
speakers have vast experience from which to draw conclusions and as a 
result the talk was very interesting 
. and destructive.
Although this is supposed to be a 
| poor boys’ school some of the fellows have parents who are slightly indul­
gent. We have heard of the formation 
of the Tech auto club with ‘!‘Honk” 
Phillips as president and H. P. Kohler 
as master mechanic. Charter members 
admitted free, and small families at 
j club rates.
Ask Prof. Trinks where the ends of 
the slider crank centroid lie. Mustn’t 
say the bad word.
Mr. Lowe (in Physics)—“What is 
meant by the latent heat of fusion of 
a substance?”Coursin—“Does that mean the latent 
heat of fusion of water, Mr. Lowe?”
Last ¡Saturday the bomb thrower 
showed up at school. His injured wing 
is dong well.
Prof. Trinks—“There is the same 
difference between the centroid and a 
circle as exists between a dog and an 
animal.”
Don’t forget February 1, at Carnegie Music Hall. The Glee Club are pre­
pared to give a concert that will make 
every Tech man feel proud of the or­ganization.------o------

Ever more shall bless.

When we from life shall part.

Here’s to all success.Then let us pledge in word and deed 
Our love for C. T. S.

THE CIVILS.
The Civils made a trip to the Home­
stead Steel Works on Saturday under the direction of Prof. Thayer. The time 
was spent principally in making de­
signs of bridges and roof trusses. It is the intention of the members of the 
faculty of the Civil Engineering Dept 
to continue these Saturday visits to. 
plants in and around Pittsburg, and test the students of their department 
in those things which have been point­
ed out.

PERSONALS.“GUEST” OF TECH.
Mr. Teddy Bear visited school last 
Tuesday. He had a large group of ad­
mirers and everyone played with “His 
Excellency”. The teachers especially 
enjoyed his visit. He even had an en­gagement with the “Civils” and we be­
lieve he spent a very pleasant day. Miss Munson, our sewing teacher, said, 
“This is the cunnin’est, fuzzy, frvizzy 
bear. I could just play with him all 
day.”
Don’t you envy him, boys?

C. H. and O. What, does that

horse and ox.
In Current Topics—Miss Harding: 
The Shah of Turkey is now dead.
Miss Law (reciting)—We hear that 
the Shah is in a worse condition than ever.
Miss Marks—The Greeks loved to be in the water.
Miss Harding—Not in the water, on 
it. I can’t imagine them all in swim­ming at once. Can you?
An egg which has been in the M. M. 
C. S. kitchen since .last April has been turned to stone. Mr. Sharp says it is 
not “putrified” but '‘petrified.”
In Economics, Prof. Willets drew a 
picture of an English Manor House. He 
was moving the grain crops from one 
place to another and one young lady 
asked: “What will you do when you come to the orchards?”
Mr. Sharp says, “When you buy 
meat you buy bones; when you buy 
land you buy stones,”
Miss. Baldwin (appearing in door of 
study room after a brief absence)—“Is this a game of cat and mice?”
Miss MerriH wants- to know why 
there are only women in heaven.
Miss Shaler is in doubt as to what 
is the correct thing to do when a man asks to marry her.
M'iss McKee to Miss Merriam—Oh 
Miss Merriam this compass just won't make a straight circle.
Many either forgot about the class 
meeting held last Monday or else they 
hadn’t enough interest in their elass 
to be present. No matter is brought 
before the class which is not of inter­
est to every one and the meetings are 
held ait such a time as will allow all 
to come. We surely want one first 
class organiaztion to be one to be 
remembered and this requires the in­
terest and support of the whole Mar­

The M. M. S. C. night division gave 
a skating party last Tuesday evening.
The Glee Club has been organized as the permanent M. M. S. C. Glee

we will soon become a creditable body.
You have often heard of persons be­
ing hoodooed by a black cat or a yel­low dog, but who ever heard of a 
score or more being placed under the mysterious ban by a black dog. This 
fate has surely befallen section “A”, 
for since the appearance of the black 
dog in the assembly room a few morn­
ings ago, six who failed to answer 
roll call were reported sick, and three 
of those present were unfit for active 
service, being disabled in one way or another. Prof. Keller has recommend­
ed the adoption of a yellow cat as a 
mascot to break thè charm.

THE DEBATING SOCIETY.
The Debating Society held its first 
regular meeting of the year, last Thurs­
day in room 201.
The debate upon the question: Re­
solved, “That student government is 
better than faculty government” was 
warmly contested. Chambers and Gray for the affirmative put forth some 
strong reasons for their side, and in 
spite of the able arguments presented 
by Henry and Hudson on the negative 
side, won by a vote of 21 to 16.
All the members took part in the 
discussion which followed the debate.
Mr. Hogen amused the members of 
the society with a humorous arid very 
realistic description of his feelings 
after smoking his first cigar.
Mr. Wagner has kindly consented to 
act as advisor to the society.
The following program Was announc­
ed for the next regular meeting, Jan. 
24: Resolved, “That President Roose­
velt should accept the nomination to 
succeed himself, provided the people 
so desire.” On the affirmative Linde- 
man and Walton; on the negative 
Reinicke and Van Horn.Mr. Ketter is also on the program 
for a talk “On the Pioneer Club.”
