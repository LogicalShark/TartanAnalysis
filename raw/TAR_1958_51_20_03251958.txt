Huge Crowd Sees Rockets 
<Take Basketball Championship
Steelers, IM All-Stars Thrill Teeliites
A standing-room-only crowd overflowed the gym last Friday night to witness an in­
tra-mural sports night that won’t be forgotten for some time. There was no let down in the 
excitement from the fencing at 7:00 to the final buzzer of the overtime basketball cham­
pionship thriller at 10:00, as the crowd was treated to more thrills than even the extensive
promotional campaign had pro- ?-----------------------— ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Raised. The throng, more than wit- 
ness most varsity basketball
games, included many faculty and 
administration members.
The earlier arrivals at 7:00 wit­
nessed some fancy fencing as 
coach Ed Kung stages the school 
championship in that sport. The 
winner was Gordon Smith who 
displayed excellent form in the 
fencing art.
Steelers
g Next the Pittsburgh Steelers 
exhibited some spectacular bask­
etball in whipping the I.M. All- 
Stars. Len Dawson, Ted Marchi- 
broda, and Fran Rogel, who had 
been All-State basketball per­
formers in high school sparked the 
Steelers in some fancy passing 
and skilled shooting that was too 
much for the Techites. Earl Mor- 
rall, John Reger, and George Tar- 
asovic rounded out the Steeler 
J'quad which displayed fine team­
work and some game-end thea­
trics.
Len Dawson, in pin-pointing 
some long fast-break passes, 
showed the skill that made him 
the nation’s leading passer and an 
All-American in 1956. Quarter­
back Marchibroda’s give-and-go 
assists and the powerful fullback 
Rogel’s outside shooting wowed

MMCC To Have 
Textile & Clothing 
Graduate School
Dr. Jules Labarthe, in accepting 
a position on the home economics 
faculty, did so not with the sole 
purpose of teaching, but also to 
J~ Establish a graduate school in tex­
tiles in Margaret Morrison. This 
school is planned to be opened a 
year from this coming fall. It will 
offer a masters degree in three 
fields: clothing, textiles, and tex­
tile education.
In addition to his work at Tech, 
Dr. Labarthe is consultant for 
Kaufmann’s and is working on a 
series of seminars for them. Also 
he is planning to do research 
* work on new products as they 
come onto the market. Through 
the courtesy of Tech he is spend­
ing several Fridays at Penn State 
University helping the PhD can­
didates start their thesis.
At present Dr. Labarthe is 
teaching a course for the junior 
and senior clothing majors, Tex­
tile Analysis. This course regular­
ly is scheduled for the second 
»semester juniors, however, last 
year there was no one available 
to teach it, thus the seniors must 
take it this year. He conducts both 
the lectures and the labs.
Dr. Labarthe is the chairman of 
the Technical Committee of Na­
tional Retail Merchants Associa­
tion. As chairman he went to 
Washington to encourage the pass­
ing of the committee’s drafted law 
for informative fiber identifica­
tion and labeling. This bill was 
not passed, however.
Tech Dramats 
To Present 
A nnual F estival
Carnegie Tech’s Annual Shake­
spearean Festival will be cele­
brated with the production of 
“Measure for Measure”, to be 
presented by the drama depart­
ment on March 29 to April 2, April 
10 to April 18, at the Fine Arts 
Theatre.
Charles Werner Moore, who 
brought us “Right You Are” earl­
ier this year, is directing the pro­
duction assisted by student direc­
tor Dick Block. The imaginative 
set was designed by Roland Lee, 
costumes by Charles Caine and 
lights effected by Tom Struthers. 
Robert Rose is the stage manager.
Park Comedy
“Measure for Measure” is one 
of Shakespeare’s famous “dark 
comedies”. It opens with serious, 
contemplative action and then 
whips into comedy that procures 
a happy ending. This shading of 
comedy and tragedy makes it a 
play of great variety and excite­
ment.
The presentation of a Shake­
spearean play is an annual event 
at our drama department. It is 
commemorative of William Shake­
speare’s birthday, and the tri­
umph of this playwright who was 
able to give form to man’s eternai 
problems.
The cast includes: Thomas Bei­
lin, Dominick Cascio, Tom Dennis, 
Muriel Eisenberg, Pamela Good­
en, Denise Huot, Patricia Hamil­
ton, Philip Jacobus, Jay Kobler, 
Karl Kraft, Lee Kurty, Joel Lev­
inson, Jerry Mickey, Jean Payn- 
ter, Jack Randall, Bert Rogal, 
Michael Stroka, Nicolas Worth,
Jack Brown, Marilyn Mooney. A 
score of freshman students com­
pose the company of extras.

Easter Assembly 
To Feature Choir, 
Reverend Norton
On Tuesday, April 1 at 11:30 
an Easter Assembly will be held 
in the Little Theater of Fine Arts. 
Included in the program, whose 
theme is “Easter, Symbol of Free­
dom,” will be a presentation by 
the combined choirs of Sigma 
Alpha Iota and Phi Mu Alpha 
Sinfonia of two songs, “O In An 
April Evening” and “God So Lov­
ed the World.” The group will be 
under the direction of Edward 
Byerly.
Another feature of the program 
will be an address by Reverend 
Mr. W. Scott Morton from Bell- 
field Presbyterian Church who 
will speak on the main theme of 
the assembly. Two student lead­
ers have been chosen to read 
Scripture and lead the invocation 
and prayers. They are Bob Sxed- 
burg and Bruce Wolf. Cassie Nied- 
zialek will be the organist for the 
assembly.
This program is another in the 
assembly program presentations. 
The Easter Assembly is under the 
supervision of the Student Chris­
tian Federation and is open to the 
Tech community.
Tech Carnival Theme 
Really “Tinted Tunes
“Tinted Tunes” is the official theme of the 1958 Spring 
Carnival Weekend. The confusion that arose in trying to con­
vey the meaning of the theme resulted in the announcement 
in last week’s Tartan of the idea (Color in Music) rather than 
the theme. In order to keep with^ — *
the carnival spirit, the theme,! fraternities battling it out
“Tinted Tunes,” has been of­
ficially defined as: “the humorous 
rendering of a song or songs with 
a color used as an adjective in the 
title.”
Carnival this year follows the 
program pattern of previous 
years: Thursday night the mid­
way opens, and fraternity booths 
are judged . . . Friday morning 
finds the campus cheering on the 
preliminary buggy races ... Fri­
day afternoon everyone will be 
gathering again ' for the long 
awaited announcement of the 
Queen at Call Day, and the offi­
cial opening of the weekend ac­
tivities . . . Immediately follow­
ing Call Day the faculty enter­
tains the students with their raw 
egg throw in front of Fine Arts, 
and the sororities. follow at the 
same location with their relays

Observations
Teller Is Wrong; US 
Must Trust USSR
By Richard Block
Many people have come up to me in the past week and 
told men that they have been enjoying my articles, that I am 
an idiot, that I couldn’t be more wrong, etc. I am happy to 
know, that people ,are reading the column but I wish that 
these people would write their protests in the form of letters 
so we could discuss them openly in the Tartan.
There was especial criticism of my treatment of 
Dr. Edward Teller. Dr. Teller is a status quo man.
. his prestige, his knowledge and the iron wall 
of secrecy which enables him to make statements 
which cannot easily be checked or refuted by critics 
outjide and often inside the government, gives this 
man a degree of influence in the area of policy 
formation which rivals that of any group . . .”
(from a lecture given by Dr. Harrison Brown, pro­
fessor of geochemistry at California Institute of 
Technology, worked in Manhattan Project). This 
influence combined with Dr. Teller’s abject refusal 
to admit even the slightest hope in dealing with 
the Soviet Union is discouraging. Dr. Teller claims

with pillows, and wallowing in 
the mud for a plank jousting 
trophy . . . Saturday night the 
festivities are concluded with the 
Carnival Ball in the Gym, and 
the awarding of the trophies. Dur­
ing all of these special events the 
Midway on the cut will be alive 
with colorful booths, games, rides, 
refreshment stands, a new special 
attraction, and all the gaiety and 
laughter that goes along with any 
carnival, and especially with 
Tech’s Carnival.
In order .to make this year’s 
Carnival a bigger and better one, 
there have been changes made 
and more careful consideration 
given many of the events. The 
Queen presentations, for instance, 
will have more emphasis.
Under the committee sponsored 
by student congress, the compet­
ing groups have had the opportun­
ity to decide the rules for their 
particular event, subject only to 
the approval of the Spring Carni­
val Committee. This has been an 
attempt to open Carnival plan­
ning to a larger portion of the 
student body, in hopes of encour­
aging more students to participate 
in this biggest of all Tech week­
ends.
Veterans* Club

Tech Guidance Bureau 
Helps Many Students
Carnegie Tech’s Bureau of Measurement and Guidance influences 
the life of each student in one way or another whether he realizes it 
or not.
The Bureau was organized over twenty years ago to help with the 
testing program for selecting students and to provide counseling for 
students who want to talk with a*-----------------------------------------------------
psychologist about their problems.
In recent years, the staff of the 
Bureau has administered fewer 
tests because the institution relies 
heavily on the College Board Ex­
aminations, but they continue to 
study the test scores each year to 
help the Director of Admissions 
determine the standards for ad­
mission and to help the Scholar­
ship Committee choose students 
for scholarships. Dr. Krug of the 
Bureau has also been experiment­
ing with other tests and even de­
signing new tests which he hopes 
will improve still further the se­
lection of students for the different 
colleges of the institution.
Nearly one out of every ten 
students takes advantage of the 
counseling services each year. Dr. 
Morgan, Head of the Bureau of 
Measurement and Guidance, says 
that the majority come on their
owqn initiative bei&use they want 
help in resolving some problem. 
Both Dr. Morgan and Mr. McCall, 
the two counselors in the Bureau, 
talk privately and confidentially 
with students on problems of any 
nature.
Students may want help in 
choosing a department or in im­
proving their study methods. 
Sometimes they want help because 
they can't get up in the morning 
or because they panic on examin­
ations. A good many students 
want to talk with a counselor 
about the problems which develop 
in getting along with their family 
or their friends.
Dr. Krug, Mr. McCall, and Dr. 
Morgan are also regular members 
of the department of psychology 
and education. They teach several 
courses each semester in addition 
to their duties in the Bureau.

A Campus-to-rCareer Case History
Roy Vaughn (left) discusses a central office power installation with Switchman R. F. Heider.
*
“I like (and get) ‘start-to-finish’ 
engineering assignments"
“When it comes to making a job inter­
esting, I think the assignments a man 
gets are more important than the size 
of the project he’s working on,” says 
Roy Vaughn of Illinois Bell Telephone 
Company. “I found that out soon after 
I graduated. My first job was with an 
organization where the projects were big. 
but the individual engineering assign­
ments lacked variety and scope.
“After this experience I looked over 
power engineering opportunities in a 
number of companies. I joined Illinois 
Bell because it promised the most inter­
esting and challenging work. That was 
three years ago. My work with IBT has 
everything that I was looking for.
“My job is to engineer the power re­
quirements for telephone central offices.
The wTork never gets routine. One job 
may be for a new building, the nett for 
expanding existing plant. And power 
needs vary tremendously from little rural 
dial offices serving a few hundred tele­
phones, to big metropolitan telephone 
plants serving hundreds of thousands.
“But what I like best is that I generally 
handle the job from start to finish. I de­
termine the operational and emergency 
power requirements of the facilities to 
be served, and order the equipment 
needed. And I’m usually on hand during 
installation to see the job through.
“Not only does this kind of engineer­
ing assignment keep work interesting, 
but I find it is helping me become a 
better manager. And that improves my 
chances for advancement.”

Technology in 1954 with a B.S. in E.E. degree. He is one

warding careers in the Bell Telephone Companies. Find

[continued, from page I] 
That the Russians can and will 
cheat. This is utter defeatism and 
representative of a kind of pessi­
mism which never accomplishes 
anything constructive.
Tests in Secret? — Nonsense
The AEC attempted a “silent” 
n^olear test last September. The 
device was detonated under­
ground, and it was small; truly 
“hidden.” The official AEC report, 
released March 6, stated that the 
shot was recorded at a maximum 
dislance of 250 miles, in Los Rn- 
geles. The report, later altered 
when the facts found their way to 
the old AEC, neglected to mention 
that the test was detected in Fair­
banks, Alaska (2300 miles from 
4 . testing area) and in Fayette, 
Arkansas (about 1250 miles) from 
the area). These recordings were 
validated by the Coast and Geo­
detic Survey at the Commerce De­
partment. Rome and Toronto also 
claimed detections but these were 
doubted. At any rate, the “secret” 
test was heard over 2000 miles 
away. Theoretically, of course, a 
test could be controlled and small 
enough so that it would create no 
^re effect than the bang of a cap 
tstel but it is doubtful that such 
explosions would be of much use 
in developing bombs. Dr. Teller is 
simply too reactionary and too 
subjective. These are poor quali­
ties when one is seeking progress 
and achievement and understand­
ing in a diverse world.
A School by 
Any Other Name
In the U.S. 180 days is an ideal 
maximum for operation. In the 
U.S.S.R. schools operate six days 
a week, ten months a year. In 
Russia there is reportedly one 
teaeher to 17 pupils, in America 
one to 27. Over ten per cent of 
the national income in the Soviet 
goes to education, while in our 
country three per cent would be a 
good guess. It takes us twelve 
years to go through what the So­
viets do in about ten. Soviet stu­
dents of high school are are in 
class seven hours a day and are 
expected to study an additional 
five hours. Twelve hours a day, 
six days a week, ten months a 
year.
You Gets What You Pays For
We all know the plight of the 
American teacher; his ill-clad 
wallet and his degrading social 
level. In some of our schools the 
teachers get less pay than the 
janitor; in many colleges the pres­
ident receives less pay than the 
football coach. Not in the Soviet 
Union!

ice, free education for his children 
and, in the case of particularly 
noteworthy work, paid vacations

he is allowed the time and at full 
pay. As important as anything 
else, he is looked up to and highly 
regarded. The sofccer coach does 
not receive higher pay than the 
Ph.D.’s.
Schools, Not Sputniks
The race is for schools, not 
sputniks. The Soviet accomplish­
ments in the field of education are 
far more frightening to us than 
the guided missiles. The former is 
the complete basis for the latter. 
A surface or superficial comeback 
will not sustain long if it is built 
upon a weak base.
“When I really feel gloomy I 
think that five years from now 
they (the Soviets) will be obvi­
ously superior to us in every area. 
But when I am optimistic I feel it 
will take ten years for them to 
achieve this position.” (Professor 
Jerome Wiesner, Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, in a talk 
before the Committee of Economic 
Development.)
Let's Learn from USSR
Our needs stand clearly before 
us. It is our responsibility to ful­
fill them or accept the conse­
quences full front. If, in the next 
ten years, the Soviet Union feels 
confident enough * to attempt to 
take the world it will be our fault 
as well as hers. No matter what 
heir next step will be, we share the 
guilt and the fault.
I want to make it clear that I 
hrave no love for the Soviet so­
ciety. I dislike it as intensely as I 
detest any totalitarian state. I do 
not defend its defects. But let’s 
face facts. And let’s never be 
scornful of knowledge gained from 
Russia. We can and should and 
MUST learn a great deal from 
her, and a great deal of high 
value. She has certainly learned a 
lot from us.
Rockets Edge ATO 
For R -Rail Crown
By Edward Blum
The 1958 Intramural Basketball campus champions are the 
Rockets! For the third straight year, the independent aggregate swept 
through its league competition into the finals. And also for the third 
straight, the Rockets displayed magnificent comeback with clutch 
playing that gave them another of the tall trophies. For ATO, the 
game was a heartbreaker, for they had rallied in the fourth quarter 
and taken the lead, only to see the game tied 41-41 at the end of 
regulation time, and to lose to the* ~~

ADVENTURE! EDUCATION!
Before some 2000 enthusiastic 
fans and faculty, ATO grabbed SoCCer CVOIVU 
an early lead. With John Dobrian 
and Rick Gesue leading the at­
tack they piled up a 6-0 advan­
tage, which was cut to 10-6 by the 
end of the quarter.
Second Period 
But in the second period, ATO 
lost the spark and their team play 
disintegrated. As the Rockets be­
gan to find the range and control 
the backboards, which were ATO’s 
exclusive property in the first 
quarter, the score began to turn.
Ken Ficery, Jim Knapp, and Jim 
Tragerser led the barrage for the 
Rockets, and loosened the tight 
ATO defense with their spectacu­
lar outside shooting. Jim Trager­
ser tallied 8 points in the first 
half; Ken Ficery scored 6, and 
Jim Knapp, the game’s eventual 
high scorer with 13 points, dropped 
in 4. At the half, the Rockets led 
ATO 21-19.
Then in the third period, ATO 
bounded back and regained the 
lead momentarily. With John Do­
brian, high man for ATO with 12 
pqipts, and Fred Garibaldi, third 
high on the team with 8 points, 
sparking the drive, they tied the 
score at 26-26, and then went 
ahead 28-26. The Rockets, who 
again were having trouble getting 
their shots to stay in the basket, 
stayed right with ATO, and, with 
a fast burst of scoring by Jim 
Knapp, Boyd Doxtader, and Jim 
Tragerser, they retook the lead at 
29-28, and extended it to 33-28 by 
the end of third period.
Final Frame
In the final frame, surely one of 
the most exciting in IM competi­
tion, Buff Atkinson and Dick Dar­
by, again aided by John Dobrian, 
stole the initiative from the Rock­
ets and brought the score to 33-31.
They hung desperately behind for 
five minutes, until, with less than 
three minutes remaining, they 
pulled to within one point of the 
defending champions at 40-39.
ATO controlled the rebounding, 
with the aid of Dick Darby and 
Frank Sobolewski, and main­
tained control of the ball through 
the next minute, but were unable 
to forge ahead until Buff Atkin­
son swished his third consecutive.
A long set shot that made the 
score 41-40, in favor of ATO. For 
a full minute, the Rockets played 
cautiously, waiting for the open­
ing that never came. Boyd Dox­
tader was foulde with 35 seconds 
remaining; he had two shots. He 
missed the first, amid loud groans 
from Rocket supporters, but drop­
ped in the second free throw for 
a 41-41 tie.

Mr. Birdy announced that 
when the weather permits, the 
soccer schedule, which should 
have begun last' Wednesday, 
March 19, will be played from the 
beginning. This means that the 
games schedule for March 19 will 
be played on the first nice day 
and the schedule will proceed 
from there; and it contradicts last 
week's notice that rained or snow- 
ed-out g^fnes will be played at 
the end of the season.
Soccer has produced one injury 
this season already. Dave Ren- 
shaw at ATO suffered a fracture 
with torn cartiledge and ligament 
in the knee during a practice 
scrimmage with KS in last Tues­
day’s mud.
Last year’s champions Beta Sig­
ma Rho lost a great deal of their 
team and are not expected to be 
as strong this year as in preeeed- 
ing years. Sigma Nu, runners up 
last year are strong this year and 
are one of the pre-season favor­
ites.
Kappa Sigma, ATO, and Pi 
Kappa Alpha are all strong again 
this year and can be counted on 
for some fine ball. A dark horse 
team is composed of a group of 
Indian students who have played 
a great deal of the sport previous­
ly. They will definitely be one of 
the teams to watch this year. All 
in all the soccer season shapes up 
as one which will provide some 
excellent games.
Both teams played cautiously 
during the three minute overtime, 
realizing- well how costly fouling 
could be. Dick Darby missed a 
free throw for ATO. Boyd Dox­
tader tallied on his with 1:05 re­
maining to give the Rockets a 42- 
41 lead. Rick Gesue hit the mark 
with a driving shot and was 
fouled. But he miss**d the foul 
shot. Rocket fans began to howl 
as the clock kept moving with 
their favorites trailing by one 
point. With less than 30 seconds 
left, Ken Ficery looped a long one- 
hand shot from behind the foul 
circle that swished through the 
net for two big Rocket points.
ATO played desperately to even 
the score, but they lost the pre­
cious ball with 15 seconds still 
ticking. The Rockets fanned out 
and passed the ball around the 
outside, carefully maintaining con­
trol, freezing the ball until the 
final buzzer sounded to give them 
a 44-43 victory, and their first con­
secutive IM basketball champion­
ship.

Experts Present 
Opinions On War 
With Soviet Union
All-out war with the Soviet 
Union is not probable in the near 
future, but the odds -would drop 
along with any decrease in Amer­
ica’s military strength. This is the 
collective opinion erf three dis­
tinguished Americans whose 
knowledge of the military and 
strategic aspects erf Soviet-U.S. 
relations is unsurpassed.
The three experts are Admiral 
Arleigh A. Burke, chief of naval 
operations; General Curtis E. Le- 
May, Air Force deputy chief of
staff; and Lewis L. Strauss, chair­
man of the Atomic Enery Com­
mission. Their opinions, offered in 
response to eight “$64,000 ques­
tions,” aappear in an article in the 
April Reader’s Digest.
Says General LeMay: Peace
can be a reality “just so long as 
the United States stays stronger 
than the Soviet Union.”
Admiral Burke agrees on the
need for strength, but implies that 
some relaxation of armaments 
may be possible if the time ever 
comes when “the Russians demon­
strate a real desire for peace.” 
Mr. Strauss believes that “last­
ing peace can be achieved only 
as a result of mutual, inspected, 
controlled disarmament and the 
eevntual reconciliation of conflict- 
ing objectives.”______________gr.

Basketball
At the half of the basketball 
final, won by the Rockets in a 
tense overtime battle, all the 
year’s I.M. trophies were given out 
by Bruce Bowen, President of the 
I.M. Managers’ Club, and Lowell 
Bassett, Vice-President of the I.M. 
Board.
Mr. Birdy, director of intra­
mural athletics, is to be congrat­
ulated for doing a terrific job and 
a huge amount of work in pre­
senting a perfect evening’s enter­
tainment. This was without a 
doubt the best I.M. Night Tech 
has ever seen. There was stand­
ing room only in the gym during 
the second half of the Steelers 
game and for the Rockets-ATO 
game. In addition to a good stu­
dent turnout, there were many 
faculty members present.
