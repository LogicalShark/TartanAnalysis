CMU enters joint venture with Apple
By ALBRECHT T. POWELL
Tartan Photography Editor
The college of Humanities and 
Social Sciences (H&SS) has 
named the Apple Macintosh II 
as its standard personal com­
puter and is suggesting that all 
freshmen enrolling in the fall of 
1989 purchase one.
The plan for the integration of 
computers into H&SS came 
about last year. Vice President 
for Academic Services William 
Arms was negotiating with 
Apple to get more Macintosh 
computers on campus and en­
courage more people to use per­
sonal computers. Apple asked 
Arms if there was a particular 
area in which they could concen­
trate their inputs. Arms imme-
diately suggested either H&SS 
or Fine Arts. After examining 
both, Arms discovered that 
Stephen Fienberg, dean of 
H&SS, was looking for ways to 
focus computing into programs 
in the college.
Apple donated 60 Mac II work­
stations and peripheral equip­
ment worth about $500,000 to 
the college. The computers will 
be used primarily for faculty 
members to develop educational 
software. Fienberg’s plan is to 
have one computer system that 
everyone can use. With the fac­
ulty working on the Mac II, and 
with students expected to either 
have one, or have access to one, 
it will be easier to provide edu­
cational media outside the class­
room to help further educate 
students and to more easily 
share information.
Arms stated that the Mac II 
was a natural choice. It was 
chosen primarily because it is 
“an attractive machine. It has a 
lot of personal power, it is pack­
aged so that you can plug it in, 
turn it on, and work with it, and 
Macintosh software is very popu­
lar.”
Fienberg foresees within the 
next two years a classroom 
highly integrated with the com­
puter, used as an educational 
tool. Currently, students use a 
variety of computational tools 
including Macintoshes, IBM PCs 
and various mainframe systems. 
Fienberg is trying to get away
from the present system and 
centralize computing around a 
college local area network (LAN) 
based on personal computers.
This would place in the hands 
of students most of the software 
they would need for their course- 
work. Much of this software 
would be purchased by the stu­
dents at a very reduced cost. 
“Take for example, and the de­
tails are not yet worked out, but 
a software package for about 
$100 containing a word proces­
sor, spread sheet, graphics pro­
gram, statistical programs, sev­
eral languages, communications 
software, to name a few.” Stu­
dents would then own these 
programs for their own use.
Fienberg states that existing
software is only the first step in 
the use of the computer. The 
H&SS faculty are intensively 
working to design coursework 
integrated with the computer, 
“...such things as HyperCard 
stacks for syllabuses, real time 
examples and problems, com­
puter demonstrations to make 
certain ideas clearer, and so on..
There are several classes that 
will immediately benefit from 
students having their own com­
puters. These include logic 
courses, which are primarily 
computer based, and program­
ming courses, such as LISP and 
Introduction to Pascal. Many 
such courses were restricted 
because the computing was done

Prompted by a toughened state law on 
underage drinking, the University has 
issued a new policy on the use of alcohol 
by students.
Both the law and the University policy 
follow on the heels of a Liquor Control 
Board raid on two Carnegie Mellon fra­
ternities last November. However, Vice 
President for Enrollment Bill Elliott 
says neither is a reaction to the raid in 
which 150 students were arrested on 
charges related to underage drinking. 
Elliott explained that the law is the 
result of what he sees as an increasing 
nationwide awareness of the dangers of 
alcohol over the past two or three years.
Under House Bill 668, which Gover­
nor Bob Casey signed into law on March 
25, underage drinking is a summary 
offense (similar to a traffic ticket) pun­
ishable by up to 90 days in jail and a 90 
day suspension of the offender’s driver’s 
license. For repeat offenders a $500 fine 
can be added and the driver’s license 
suspension can last up to one year.
Selling or furnishing alcohol to minors 
and misrepresenting one’s age in order 
to buy alcohol are now third degree mis­
demeanors. Both carry a maximum 
penalty of one year in jail in addition to 
fines. In the case of falsifying one’s age, 
the law also requires a 90 day driver’s 
license suspension for first time offend­
ers and a one year suspension for repeat 
offenders. In addition, magistrates are 
not allowed to give suspended sentences 
for either crime.
In order to assist students in comply­
ing with the law, the University has 
issued an alcohol policy which was sent 
to parents of students over the summer 
and will be distributed on campus in the 
near future. The two-page document 
• describes significant parts of the Penn­
sylvania law and establishes rules for 
the use of alcohol at student social 
events.
Under the policy, permission must be 
obtained from the Dean of Student Af­
fairs to serve alcohol in situations where 
students will be present. Before the ap­
proval will be given a Dean, department 
head, faculty member, or non-hourly 
employee of the University must take 
personal responsibility for making sure 
that students under 21 years old are not 
served.
The policy also requires that on-cam- 
pus events at which alcohol is served be 
held indoors and in private or semi-pri- 
vate areas. Organizers of the events must 
restrict publicity of the event to the Uni­
versity community and may not publi­
cize the fact that alcohol will be served. 
Students are reminded that Liquor 
Control Board licenses are required be­
fore one may charge money for alcohol.
The alcohol policy states that the Uni­
versity recognizes students’ right to pri­
vacy in their residential areas and sug­
gests that the University will not at­
tempt to exert control over students in 
these areas unless they cause damage or 
violate the rights of others. However, the 
policy points out that students are still 
responsible for obeying state law.
The techniques for enforcing the alco­
hol policy’s rules are still being devel­
oped. The policy itself states that stu­
dents who act irresponsibly will be sub­
ject to “severe disciplinary action begin­
ning with monetary sanctions up to and 
including suspension or expulsion.” A 
letter sent to parents along with the 
alcohol policy states that Campus Police 
will be allowed to issue citations to stu­
dents who violate the alcohol policy. The 
citations will carry fines between twenty 
and fifty dollars.
According to Elliott, the University is 
not attempting to take over primary 
responsibility for enforcing state law. 
Instead, he said that “We are basically 
trying to at least get in between our 
community and the law to the point in

Concern is mounting over the 
decrease in the number of Car­
negie Institute of Technology 
(CIT) applications for the fall 
1988 term.
There were 2295 applications 
received for this fall’s engineer­
ing class. This number is down 
almost 200 from last year’s mark.
Associate Director of Admis­
sions John Papinchak stated 
that CMU fell short of its target 
of350 CIT students. Of the 1204 
admitted, only 334 have chosen 
to attend Carnegie Mellon. Last 
year 320 students out of 1047 
accepted chose to attend CMU.
According to Papinchak, the 
decrease in engineering appli­
cations appears to be a national 
trend. He also states that Direc-

Though the East Campus 
construction project is run­
ning behind schedule, Uni­
versity officials still intend to 
have a new dormitory ready 
for occupancy by the fall of 
1989. “We’d like to make up 
time some way,” commented 
Associate Director of Campus 
Operations Oscar Mayer.
Some unplanned complica­
tions this summer have 
slowed down the construction, 
even though workers lost little 
time because of rain. One 
major complication was the 
discovery of a shelf of rock 
under the site for the new 
dormitory and dining facility, 
tore samples had indicated 
that caissons needed to se­
cure the building’s foundation 
would have to be placed 50 to
75 feet into the ground to reach 
a solid base. The discovery of the 
shelf forced a redesign of the 140 
caissons.
Double shifts of work may 
become necessary if there are 
further delays. At present con­
struction is not scheduled for
weekends or during early 
morning hours to control 
bothersome noise.

Carnegie Mellon and IBM have announced plans for the ex­
perimental deployment of a prototype nationwide computer 
file system based on the Andrew File System (AFS). The 
system will initially involve researchers only but is expected 
to be expanded to include the business community. Carnegie 
Mellon and IBM hope AFS will become an industry standard.

In early August Metallurgical Engineering and Materials 
Science professor Richard J. Fruehan became the first occu­
pant of the POSCO chair in Iron and Steelmaking. The chair 
is funded by a $1 million grant from the Pohang Steel 
Company of South Korea. Fruehan received his bachelor’s 
and doctor’s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and 
has been a member of the MEMS faculty since 1980.
New director of physical plant named
In June William G. Matthews, director of facilities for the 
Pittsburgh School District for the past five years, was ap­
pointed director of Physical Plant. Matthews has responsibil­
ity for Design and Construction, the Craft Maintenance 
Shops, Grounds and Transportation, and General Receiving 
and Housekeeping. Prior to joining the Pittsburgh School 
District, Matthews held several senior facilities management 
positions in the U.S. Navy.
Lazarus appointed Associate Dean
Associate Dean of Carnegie Mellon’s Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration Dr. Barbara Lazarus was ap­
pointed Associate Provost of Academic Projects on July 1. She 
will implement a new program of academic advising, estab­
lish new relationships between offices responsible for aca­
demic and career development, and assist the university’s 
Dean’s Council in expanding CMU’s international program.
Murphy accepts new positions
Michael Murphy has been selected as the new Student 
Ombudsman and Coordinator of Special Projects.
Murphy’s job is twofold. As ombudsman, he is responsible for 
dealing with student concerns and problems on a confidential 
basis. If someone doesn’t know where to turn, Murphy will 
direct them to the particular department or area to get the 
assistance they need. Even on more broad based issues such 
as the future of the campus, Murphy wants students to come 
and talk to him.
As coordinator of special projects, Murphy assists in the 
planning, programming, and implementation of campus wide 
projects. These range from athletics to student activities to 
faculty and student interaction.
Murphy has been associated with Carnegie Mellon for several 
years working as Assistant Director of Housing for Residence 
Life. See related story: University Living pg L2.

GENEVA (AP) — The U.N. 
secretary-general blamed dis­
agreements over an immediate 
troop withdrawal and a mari­
time cease-fire for stalling for­
mal Iran-lraq peace talks.
“We are trying to clear the first 
part (of a U.N. peace resolution) 
on an immediate cease-fire and 
a troop withdrawal without de­
lay. . . . The cease-fire at sea is 
part of the problem,” Secretary- 
General Javier Perez de Cuellar 
said.
Formal sessions between For­
eign Ministers Ali Akbar Ve- 
layati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of 
Iraq have been suspended since 
Aug. 26. Plans for a formal ses­
sion Monday, Aug. 29, were 
shelved without explanation.
Low-level talks with Iran and 
Iraq were continuing.
Aziz said last Monday, that it 
would be impossible to advance 
to other points until Iran agreed 
that the cease-fire extended over 
all Persian Gulf waters.
“It is a very difficult problem, 
and it cannot be expected that 
this will be resolved in a few 
days,” Perez de Cuellar said.

GDANSK, Poland (AP)—Ship­
yard and dock workers in 
Gdansk agreed to end their 
strike at the request of Lech 
Walesa, but striking coal min­
ers who began the current labor 
unrest demanded to meet with 
the Solidarity chairman.
In a meeting with Walesa yes­
terday, senior government offi­
cials promised talks on reinstat­
ing the banned free trade union 
movement and jointly solving 
the country’s social and economic 
problems. In exchange, the offi­
cials demanded an end to 
Poland’s most serious strike 
wave in seven years.
Walesa won agreement to end 
the strikes from workers at the 
Lenin shipyard and the sepa­
rate Repair shipyard as well as 
the Gdansk port after he went to 
all three facilities to deliver his 
appeal to the striking workers.
Seven other enterprises re­
mained on strike.
A Solidarity spokesman said 
workers at the July Manifesto 
mine in southern Poland said 
they would not end their occu­
pation strike until local issues of 
pay and work conditions are 
settled and until Lech Walesa 
visits the mine to explain his ap­
peal.

GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) — A 
Delta Air Lines 727 crashed on 
takeoff Wednesday at Dallas 
Fort-Worth Airport, officials 
said. The Boeing 727 en route to 
Salt Lake City went down in 
hazy sunshine, broke into two 
and burst into flames on a flat, 
grassy field near the runway. 
Many of the survivors climbed 
to safety through a blackened 
hole in the top of the cabin.
At least 96 passengers and crew
scrambled to safety through the 
shattered fuselage.
Nine deaths were confirmed 
following the crash, Delta 
spokesman Bill Berry said, and 
about 40 people were reported 
seriously injured.
A source involved in the Na­
tional Transportation Safety 
Board investigation said early 
indications were that the jettook 
an unusually long time to be­
come airborne, that it climbed to 
only about 80 feet, and that the 
left wing struck the runway first.
The Boeing 727 was powered 
by JT8D engines manufactured 
by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of 
United Technologies Corp.
David M. Long, a spokesman 
for Pratt & Whitney, said the 
company immediately sent two 
investigators to the crash site to 
assist with the investigation.
Long said it was a routine pol­
icy for the company to send its 
investigators to all crashes in 
which aircraft are powered by 
Pratt & Whitney engines.
He said it was “way too early” 
to speculate on the cause of the 
crash.
The JT8D received its certifi­
cation from the Federal Avia­
tion Administration in 1967 and 
about 10,000 are now in use.

Words from the Student Body President
Andy tells you where to take your
Freshman Camp is over, and 
Orientation is just a memory. 
Thank God — it’s about time. 
You were all starting to have a 
little too much fun there, and we 
were worried that you’d get the 
wrong idea.
Carnegie Mellon isn’t about fun. 
It’s no sleep. No social life. No 
time for anything youwanttodo, 
unless you really like lab reports 
and minitab.
But hey, don’t complain. You 
expected that. You could have 
gone to a less academically 
strenuous school, but no-o-o, you 
chose Carnegie Mellon.
But you also expected to have 
some fun. College is “the last 
step before you enter the real 
world... time to sow wild oats... 
time to blow off steam... time to 
grow up.” and a gazillion other 
cliches that the college catalogs 
and your parents told you.
Carnegie Mellon tries to 
smother that; and it will suc­
ceed, if you let it.
There are ways to fight back — 
the first was at last Thursday’s 
Activities Fair. In case you 
missed it, over 40 organizations 
were all competing for the same 
scarce resource. You.
With Dean Stephen Fienberg’s 
endorsement of Apple’s Macin­
tosh II and suggestion that all 
1989 Humanities and Social 
Sciences freshmen purchase one 
o^ the $3,000 machines, Carne­
gie Mellon is on the threshold of 
some exciting possibilities, pro­
vided that it enhances education 
rather than becomes a financial 
burden.
It’s hard not to be skeptical. For 
how many years has the admini­
stration promised to require all 
freshmen to buy their own com­
puters? For how many years has 
the administration promised to 
make all classes use the Andrew 
computer system? For how many 
years has the administration 
promised to activate the campus 
ethernet? It’s hard not to be 
skeptical.
But...
Computers can be used as 
powerful teaching aids, comple­
menting existing teaching meth­
ods and instructional materials, 
not replacing or forcing the rede­
sign of existing techniques.
The primary issue is whether
No matter what your interests, 
no matter what you have to con­
tribute, no matter what you are 
looking for, there is probably an 
organization on campus that can 
fill your needs.
From the Society for Creative 
Anachronism to GALA, WRCT 
to the Computer Club, there is a 
vast legion of diverse groups on 
campus that actually (can you 
believe it?) encourage fun. Ex­
pect it, even.
Check them out. The Activities 
Fair was last week, but most or­
ganizations welcome new mem­
bers year around.
We don’t mean to sound so cyni­
cal. We have fun at The Tartan
— a lot of it. It’s just that we’ve 
watched too many of our class­
mates go through the educational 
machine with nothing to show at 
the end but a transcript, a nasty 
disposition and bags etched per­
manently under their eyes.
The bottom line is making the 
most out of your four years here, 
and that requires augmenting 
your academics with social ac­
tivities. As Einstein once said, 
“Never let school interfere with 
your education.” Words we take 
to heart.
using computers is a more effec­
tive way to teach. Forcing stu­
dents to buy powerful worksta­
tions and forcing faculty mem­
bers to integrate their courses 
onto those computers will not 
automatically make a Carnegie 
Mellon education any better than 
it is now.
Another consideration is price. 
When compared to the cost of a 
Carnegie Mellon education, 
$3,000 might not seem like a lot 
of money. But, to a family com­
pletely strapped to pay the exist­
ing tuition, $3,000 might be the 
straw that breaks the camel’s 
back.
Dean Fienberg guarantees that 
no one will be denied a computer 
because of cost. But, unless some 
creative renting schemes are 
actually implemented or public 
clusters are expanded for stu­
dents who cannot afford to buy 
their own machines, Dean Fien­
berg will have a tough time keep­
ing his promise.
Overall, the move is a positive 
one... if the University keeps its 
promises.
Welcome back to a new year of con­
struction. Though it might be incon­
venient at the moment, mostoftheeast 
campus construction should be done by 
next year. Improvements have not just 
been at the construction site. If you 
went to classes last week, you probably 
saw that more classrooms have been 
carpeted and have new desks.
Andy Robitshek
The campus looks different now than 
it did three years ago. There have been 
many changes and things are assuredly 
looking better. An important change in 
making our university a more educa­
tional environment for everyone is the 
interaction of students and faculty out­
side of the classroom. Freshman Orien­
tation this year included an academic 
orientation to campus with additional 
contact with faculty members besides 
the classroom experience.
Although prices for books have gone 
up, the new increased discount of 15% 
on textbooks helps reduce that cost. We 
are continuing to work with the book 
store to try and be able to have them 
provide textbooks at cost for students 
in the next two years.
I want to welcome all of you back to 
the campus and to give a special wel­
come to our freshmen. As you can see by 
looking to the east, we have had a busy 
summer. The work is vigorously under­
way to build the new dormitory with 
new dining facilities, as well as a park­
ing garage and new athletic fields.
The loss of the football field has meant
President Richard M. Cyert
a problem for the football team, bothfor 
practice and for games. We have solved 
the practice problem by utilizing the 
Cut, as I am sure you have all noticed. 
We looked for other practice fields, but 
decided in favor of the Cut so that we 
could eliminate long bus rides for the 
players and enable them to continue to 
have more time for studying, as well as 
for practice. Since we will be playing 
our games at Mt. Lebanon, it will be a 
little less convenient to get to the games. 
We will, however, be running buses, 
and I hope that all of you will be able to 
attend and cheer the team. I was pleased 
to learn that the freshmen went to the 
game last Saturday and released 92 
balloons, symbolic of their 1992 gradu­
ation date. I think that idea was terri­
fic.
It is good to see the campus filled with 
students again. This campus was built 
for people like you, and it has a lonely 
feeling and appearance when there are 
only a few students here.
This year’s freshman are another out­
standing group of students. They come 
from all parts of the world, and all of 
them have had significant academic 
success in their school careers. The 
total registered is approximately 1,170, 
slightly above the number we aimed at,
1,150.
We had orientation for the new fac­
ulty as well as for the freshmen. I par­
ticipated in both orientations and was 
pleased to meet some of our new faculty
There are also other events and proj­
ects occurring on campus. A large ef­
fort is being put forth to get students 
involved in sporting events. Many 
people have complained about the lack 
of school spirit here, and for one of the 
first times, the administration has 
placed an effort in getting students 
involved in these events. There were 
seven busloads of fans who went to the 
first football game.
This year I will again be working with 
the Student Senate to coordinate the 
SACs (Student Advisory Councils — a 
group of students in a department who 
meet with the department head or other 
advisor) in all the departments. The 
departments will then be getting stu­
dent input on ideas and projects that 
they are working on. Problems in de­
partments will get solved before they 
get out of hand. If you do have a prob­
lem, you can try and get hold of the SAC 
in your department. At the same time, 
any of the Student Senators are avail­
able to help you.
I have been asked by many people 
about getting the Fence fixed, and yes, 
we are working on it. We are looking at 
a few different solutions to try and fix it 
as soon as possible. If you have any 
suggestions, please feel free to call me
and some of our freshmen. The aim of 
an orientation is to make new people 
better acquainted with the university 
and its physical surroundings, but more 
importantly, better acquainted with the 
philosophy and the thrust of the insti­
tution.
Carnegie Mellon remains dedicated 
to achieving excellence in our teaching 
and in our research. The two objectives 
are equally important and are the dis­
semination of knowledge and the crea­
tion of new knowledge. We have put an 
increasing emphasis on improving our 
teaching over the last five years, and 
we are making significant progress. I 
want Carnegie Mellon to be the best 
teaching university in the country and 
also the best research university in the 
country. We can accomplish this goal 
by emphasizing, more than most re­
search universities do, the importance 
of teaching. We have a large number of 
faculty who are dedicated to being out­
standing teachers and, with the help of 
the Teaching Center, we are improving 
both faculty and graduate students in 
their ability to teach. The Teaching 
Center, under Ted Fenton, is an essen­
tial part of this whole approach.
We are continuing to work hard on 
raising money, so that we con complete 
our building program. The fund drive 
is going well, and we are well on our 
way to attaining the $200 million that 
we are after. The difficulty is in getting 
the dollars in the form that we want. It 
is easier for us to get dollars for profes­
sorships and scholarships than it is for 
bricks and mortar. Fewer and fewer 
people are interested in buildings, but 
we are finding a number of people who 
are still interested in supporting that 
activity. I am devoting an increasingly 
larger proportion of my time to fund 
raising and have been doing so this 
summer. We will continue in this mode 
until we have completed the campaign 
and received the funds that we need for 
the new buildings that we wish to have.

improve our campus. These include! 
committees dealing with the retail’ 
stores, the Senior Banquet, faculty 
course evaluations, the tenure system,, 
and the Registrar’s Office. In addition,, 
I have reformed the Enthusiasm Com­

to talk to the students concerning the 
state of the University. I am pleased to 
have this opportunity, and I hope that 
all of you come to that talk when it is 
scheduled. It will give me a chance to 
speak about a variety of events under­

you a chance to ask a few questions.
I again extend a warm welcome back 
to the campus to all of you. It is great to 
have you back. I know this university is 
a place where we work hard. At the 
same time, however, I hope that it is a 
place where you can enjoy yourself. I 
wish you the best of luck for the coming 
semester and hope that I will have a 
chance to meet those of you whom I 
have not yet met. My best wishes for a 
great year.

Now that a new school year is under assignments that look as though y| 
way, we have an idea that’ll make both bribed a friend in art school. And1
you and your parents feel a bit more 
confident come finals time:
Get a Macintosh* computer to help 
with your homework.
Then you’ll never have to spend 
another all-nighter retyping a paper 
just to purge a few typos and dangling 
modifiers. You’ll be able to crank out
an amazing new program called 
HyperCard—which just happens 
to come packaged with every 
Macintosh—you can easily store, 
organize, and cross-reference rese 
notes to your heart’s content.

Macintoshes strongly urged 
for future H&SS students

on a special research computer. 
Other courses which will benefit 
include statistics, ethics, psy­
chology, and of course, writing.
Fienberg gave several power­
ful examples of what could be 
done with such computer inte­
gration. For example, the 1970 
U.S. Census is available on 
magnetic tape. To get a special­
ized report on a segment of the 
population costs thousands of 
dollars. The 1990 census, will be 
entirely contained on one or two 
compact discs. These are read­
able by computers, and students 
can use current real world data 
in their problem solving.
The Macintosh IIs will also be 
usable as Andrew workstations 
in the near future. Apple and 
the computer science depart­
ment is working to integrate 
Unix based software on the 
Macintosh. This should solve the 
several year old dilemma of what 
workstation to recommend stu­
dents use with the Andrew sys­
tem.
Fienberg stressed that the pur­
chase of this computer would be
“[Computers] are not 
required, just as text­
books are not required.” 
—Dean Fienberg
very advantageous and attrac­
tive to students. “They are not 
required, just as textbooks are 
not required. A student can 
borrow a friend’s textbook, or 
check one out of the library. 
Similarly, with the computer... 
but we do expect they have ac­
cess to one,” mentioned Fien­
berg.
Although costs have not been 
finalized, a discount of about 
40% is expected on the machines. 
That would bring the cost to the 
student down from $5,000 to 
about $3,000. This price will be 
available to all Carnegie Mellon 
students, not just to H&SS stu­
dents. Financial aid is working 
to integrate the cost of the ma­
chine into the students’ educa­
tional costs. “No one will be de­
prived of a computer because of 
cost,” added Fienberg.
Camagie Mellon is one of only 
about 100 schools nationwide 
that have a requirement or 
strong suggestion for the pur­
chase of a computer.
There are some problems that 
still need to be worked out. There 
will be a need for a new central­
ized printing network. The col­
lege will have to make sure fac­
ulty do convert coursework over 
to the computer. After all, if a 
professor has been teaching a 
class for several years with the 
same materials, what is the 
incentive of taking the time to 
convert it to computer applica­
tions? Fienberg replied to this 
last question that peer pressure 
will take care of a lot of that. 
Also, the department has hired 
several full-time programmers 
to help faculty with their com­
puter work.
Arms foresees computers be­
coming more of a dorm-room 
item. Perhaps even giving stu­
dents the option of “renting” a 
computer as part of their hous­
ing contract.
Fienberg summed the project 
up by saying, “We want to make 
life easier on the student, and 
the classroom experience more 
exciting, taking advantage of the 
power of computers.”
Construction begins on campus
a.UorU1uv p3.I 8l'u B
The construction work is co­
ordinated by Barton-Malow/ 
McAnallan, Carnegie 
Mellon’s construction man­
ager. The East Campus proj­
ect includes the constrtuction 
of a dormitory/residence hall, 
parking garage, a football 
field, and intramural fields.
Construction began in June 
when the stadium was de­
molished and earth was 
moved to prepare the founda­
tion for the dormitory.
In August, the Intramural 
Fields were paved over to re­
place the parking spaces that 
were lost by closing the long 
Skibo lot. Construction of a 
600-space parking garage at 
that site will begin soon.
Administrators have been 
working to convince CMU’s 
neighbors that the 600-foot 
long building will not ad­
versely affect the area. Local 
residents have expressed con­
cerns that the building will 
disrupt traffic on Forbes 
Avenue and Beeler Street. In 
addition, the aesthetics of the 
garage have raised concerns.
To alleviate the fears of the 
neighbors, Public Relations 
has produced a newsletter
called “Good Neighbors” for resi­
dents who live near the Univer­
sity. The July issue assures that 
the garage’s gates will not be 
near the street entrances.
The garage will be “one of the 
most attractive urban facades 
in Pittsburgh,” according to 
Meyer. The outside walls of the 
garage will be built in the same 
style as those in the College of 
Fine Arts.
The new Margaret Morrison 
lot will be used at least until 
next summer. Spring Carnival 
Chairman Dave Levy and Uni­
versity officials are considering 
holding next year’s Carnival on 
the lot.
When the garage is completed, 
the Margaret Morrison lot will 
be removed and the new IM fields 
will be built. The land will have 
to be graded to the proper level. 
Eventually, the IM fields will be 
lighted.
Though the total recreational 
area will be larger, the field will 
not be large enough for regula­
tion baseball. Two fields will 
have diamonds for softball. They 
will also be used for intramural 
football, soccer, and lacrosse.
Meyer stresses that the East 
Campus project “enables the 
University Center.” The project,
he contends, “is a logical set of 
circumstances [for which] the 
University Center is the driv­
ing force.”
The University Center will 
be built on the current site of 
Skibo and the Skibo parking 
lot. The new 412-seat dining 
facility will replace the food 
service lost when Skibo is tom 
down for the second phase of 
the construction.
The decision to build a new 
dormitory was the result of 
an agreement between the 
University and residents of 
Shadyside and Oakland. The 
University promised to dis­
continue housing students in 
those neighborhoods in 1989. 
The loss of housing in those 
areas required the building of 
a new facility.
The dormitory will also have 
the effect of unifying the Hill 
dorms. Student populations 
in north and south housing 
will be nearly evenly divided 
with the addition of the dorm. 
The residence hall is designed 
to house 302 students.
The construction plan also 
calls for a walkway to run 
along the new dorm as an 
access from the Hill to the 
Student Center.
New policy restricts use of alcohol
a.UorU1uv p3.I 8l'u B
time that the State Police don’t 
have to come in and do whatever 
they do when they find people 
that are breaking the law.”
One Resident Assistant who 
asked not to be named, felt the 
University was vague in in­
structing RAs about their re­
sponsibilities under the new 
policy. Furthermore, she ex-
plained that the only concrete 
restriction placed on her is that 
she can not plan activities which 
involve alcohol. She also said 
that as far as drinking in rooms 
is concerned, “As long as I don’t 
. . . see it, I’m not going to re­
spond.” She believes that other 
RAs will probably take a similar 
approach.
The fraternities are working
with the University and the LCB 
to develop procedures for par­
ties. Elliott said that fraternity 
houses are residential areas, 
whose occupants are entitled to 
the same privacy rights as occu­
pants of dorm rooms. However, 
he said that “If it [drinking at 
parties] is called to our atten­
tion, then obviously we’ve got to 
take the appropriate action.”

a.UorU1uv p3.I 8l'u B
tor of Admissions Mike Stieidel 
has meet with the engineering 
department heads in order to 
devise some strategies to attract 
engineering students.
One strategy that will be im­
plemented to attract more stu­
dents is a letter writing cam­
paign. According to Papinchak, 
CMU has never conducted a let­
ter writing campaign, but due to 
the decrease in the number of 
CIT applicants one will be con­
ducted for the next year.
The Admissions Office will 
begin sending students who have 
inquired into the engineering 
program letters explaining the 
different programs available. 
The civil engineering depart­
ment has gone as far as sending 
those who have inquired a video 
cassette that describes the pro­
gram.
Despite the decline in the 
number of engineering applica­
tions, the University saw an 
overall increase in the number 
of applications. The College of 
Fine Arts (CFA), the College of 
Humanities and Social Sciences, 
Mellon College of Science (MCS), 
and Industrial Management 
(IM) all posted gains.
Targets of 250 freshmen stu­
dents were exceeded in the CFA, 
H&SS, and MCS. IM exceeded 
its target of fifty freshmen.
When asked about the quality 
of the freshman class Papinchak 
stated, “They are as bright, if 
not brighter, than classes in the 
past four years.” Papinchak feels 
that it is getting harder to admit 
the freshman class every year 
because there is no real differ­
entiation between the clear ad­
mits and the clear rejects.

V8.Us.3uv hn n.13 7aor)rorus Suu
By ERIKA L. PETERSON
Tartan Managing Editor 
AB — Activities Board — 
those mysterious folks with the 
office upstairs in Skibo — just 
what are they up to this year? 
Will they be able to top last year’s 
tropical island complete-with- 
sand reggae dance? Will Donald 
Woods be as — well — contro­
versial as his gonzo counterpart 
Hunter S. Thompson? Perhaps 
not, but this semester’s AB 
schedule promises a good bit of 
much needed entertainment — 
something to fill up that copious 
free time...
AB Dance: My personal fa­
vorite, AB Dance will be bring­
ing us Blues with the “Uptown 
Rhythm Kings” and “The Grand­
sons of the Pioneers,” on Satur­
day, September 17 at 9 pm in the 
Ballroom. The next weekend, on 
Friday, September 23, same 
time, same place, is something 
called “Rock” with a band called 
“The Magnetics.” Can’t tell you 
much more—go check it out. On 
Friday, October 21, AB is bring­
ing back a CMU favorite — 
Reggae with “The Flow.”TheyVe 
played the Ballroom and DTD 
each at least once and are defi­
nitely worth the opportunity cost 
of an evening of studying eco­
nomics. There’s no time listed, 
and they say it’s going to be 
outdoors, so cold or rain will 
likely send them into the Gym, 
but it’ll be a good show in any 
case. Finally, on Saturday, Oc­
tober 29 at 8 pm, it’s big band 
with “The Tommy Dorsey Or­
chestra” in the Ballroom. Well 
thought of on the Big Band scene, 
this should be good if you liked 
George Gee last year.
AB Coffeehouse: Coffee­
house starts off the season this 
weekend, on Friday, September 
9 in the Wherrett Room with a 
reportedly hysterical comedy 
troupe, “Guilty Children.” I have 
it on good authority that they 
will indeed be funny, and as 
usual with a comedy Coffee­
house, get there early or you 
won’t get a seat. On Saturday, 
October 15, Coffeehouse is bring­
Steel Pulse will be up on Flagstaff Hill Sunday - it’s at 2
ing a real live hypnotist to the 
Ballroom at 8 pm. James Mapes, 
who played Coffehouse two years 
ago, is returning to campus. 
Could be interesting — I expect 
we’ll all walk out saying “I loved 
it. It was much better than 
CATS. I’m going to see it again 
and again.” Finally, AB lists that 
perennial favorite, the Airband 
competition, on Saturday, No­
vember 12 in the Ballroom. Ron 
Dari an will emcee as your friends 
contort their lips in a concerted 
effort to attain the width of Mick 
Jagger’s mouth.
AB Lectures: Two writers 
lecture this semester — on
Wednesday, October 26 at 8 pm 
in the Ballroom will be journal­
ist Donald Woods, friend ofSouth 
African anti-apartheid activist 
Stephen Biko, and author of Cry 
Freedom. This should be an in­
formative evening, especially for 
us insular, apathetic CMU stu­
dents — you might very well 
learn something. Next, on Tues­
day, November 15 at 7pm in the 
Ballroom, the author of the re­
cent bestseller Bonfire of the 
Vanities, the sixties counter­
culture classicTTie Electric Kool- 
AidAcid Test and the space-age 
historical The Right Stuff—Tom 
Wolfe — will speak. This is defi­
photo courtesy MCA Records
pm, so don’t be late
nitely one not to be missed — 
it’ll be packed too, so come early.
AB Concerts: Just one
listed, but it should be a blast. 
Reggae with rastamen Steel 
Pulse this Sunday, September
11 at 1pm on Flagstaff Hill, or 
the gym if it rains. They’ve been 
around since 1975, have several 
albums, and toured with INXS 
this summer. Sounds like a 
promising Sunday afternoon. At 
least, if it doesn’t rain.

ule changes of Activities Board

Last Temptation is here
By MICHAEL ROSE
Tartan Diversions Editor
Once in a while, in between 
all the sexploitation flicks, 
teens in lust and teens in 
trouble movies, and ridicu­
lous comedies comes a film 
with incredible social impact 
and artistic merit that doesn’t 
talk down to its audience or 
hold with old assumptions 
about what we believe. Only 
once in a while.
Once in a while there is a 
film like The Last Tempta­
tion Of Christ. It may not be 
for everybody, but it is a fas­
cinating exploration of the life 
and times of the most myste­
rious individual in history. 
It’s thought-provoking and 
sometimes disturbing. That’s 
what good filmmaking is all 
about.
The Last Temptation Of 
Christ is Martin Scorsese’s 
adaptation of the novel of the 
same name. The book consid­
ers Jesus in both his divine 
and human aspects, and deals 
primarily with the conflict of 
the martyr as he is tom be­
tween his human desires and 
the mandate of his godhood. 
It is not based on the gospels 
as such; rather, it takes a 
creative look at the story that 
they tell.
Last Temptation was origi­
nally scheduled for Novem­
ber release. However, due to 
the substantial controversy 
surrounding the film in pre­
release, it was de­
cided that it should 
be released early. Re­
ligious leaders de­
nounced the film and 
large crowds turned 
out to protest the 
limited opening. Time 
magazine’s cover of “Who was 
Jesus?” in August fueled the 
media hype. The film opened 
to sellout crowds on both sides 
of the police line.
In Pittsburgh, the film 
opened last week at the King’s 
Court theater in Oakland. 
Interestingly enough, as the
9 pm show began, only a 
handful of protesters turned 
out to admonish the audi­
ence members. At approxi­
mately 10:45 pm, however, 
large numbers of protesters 
appeared, just in time (it 
would seem) for the 11:00 
television news.
As a reviewer, I liked the 
film. From a rather informal 
audience poll, a good portion 
of those attending felt simi­
larly. The film stars Willem 
Dafoe as Jesus, Harvey 
Keitel as Judas, Harry Dean 
Stanton as Saul/Paul, Bar­
bara Hershey as Mary 
Magdalene, and David Bowie 
in a magnificent cameo as 
Pontius Pilate. All are spec­
tacular. Dafoe gives a won­
derful sense of the power he 
has but cannot fully under­
stand. Keitel is remarkably 
good as the betrayed be­
trayer, and as much as the ~ 
film hangs on Dafoe’s shoul­
ders, it is Judas and not Peter 
that is the rock on which Last 
Temptation is built.
The story itself is intrigu­
ing. The basic premise of both 
book and film is that Jesus 
was uncertain of himself and 
tormented by his divinity, by 
his very martyrdom. Most of 
the controversy has centered 
around a fifteen-minute fan­
tasy sequence that takes 
place as Jesus is being cruci­
fied. Jesus is seen within that 
sequence making love to 
Mary Magdalene, 
and is depicted with 
a wife and family in 
later life. This se­
quence is extraordi­
narily powerful, es­
pecially the encoun- ~ 
ter between Jesus 
and the convert Paul. Al­
though some people might 
have difficulty dealing with 
a sexual Jesus, if they were 
that sensitive they probably 
would have left the theater 
long before.
The film is long. Really

Autumn means different things 
to different people. Although you 
and I are in the midst of starting 
off the school year, in Hollywood 
the studios and the stars are 
gearing up for the fall releases. 
; The Tartan has received advance 
information on some upcoming 
films and we’d like to tell you 
about them so you can start 
planning those precious nights 
off-campus well in advance.
Walt Disney Pictures has been 
doing land-office business lately, 
especially under their Touch­
stone adult-oriented label. With 
such films as Big Business, Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit? and Good 
Morning, Vietnam in the sum­
mer movie market, Disney/ 
Touchstone is primed for a 
magnificent fall release sched­
ule. Watch next month for the
release of The Good Mother, a 
film directed by Leonard Nimoy 
and starring Diane Keaton. The 
drama, based on Sue Miller’s 
1986 novel of the same name, 
takes a close look at the social 
and emotional conflicts of single 
parenting in the 1980’s.
Disney also has plans for a 
brand new animated feature to 
be released in November. The 
film, Oliver & Company, is a 
retelling of Dickens’ Oliver Twist 
from the point of view of a ca­
nine cast of characters featur­
ing the voices of Cheech Marin, 
Billy Joel and Bette Midler. In 
December, Touchstone will be 
releasing two films; one tenta­
tively titled Fugitives, a comedy 
starring Martin Short and Nick 
Nolte, and Beaches, starring 
Bette Midler and Barbara 
Hershey. Beaches is directed by 
Garry Marshall and is based on

Director John Sayles>and writer Studs Terkel moonlight 
as journalists in Eight Men Out
the novel of the same name by 
Iris Ranier Dart. Mrs. Dart, a 
CMU alumna, is also the author 
of The Boys In The Mail Room.
Paramount Pictures hit it big 
this summer with Eddie Mur­
phy’s Coming To America, and 
current offerings include Jeff 
Bridges in Tucker. Coming this 
fall are four films, with the most 
eagerly awaited by far being the 
live concert film of Rock Band 
U2, entitled Rattle and Hum. 
The film, with footage from the 
band’s recent world tour, should 
be released in early October, with 
the accompanying double album 
arriving in stores sometime next 
week.
Also from Paramount are a pair 
of dramas and an offbeat com­
edy, all coming this fall. The 
Accused stars Jodie Foster as a 
rape victim and Kelly McGillis 
as her crusading lawyer, in a 
Jonathan Kaplan film. John 
Lithgo w, late of the Tony-award- 
winning play M. Butterfly, plays 
a Vietnam P.O.W. in Distant 
Thunder who tries to come to 
terms with his teenage son, 
played by Ra\ph(TheKarateKid) 
Macchio. Lastly, Paramount pre­
sents an oddball combination in 
The Experts, with John Travolta 
and Arye (Soul Man) Gross as 
American instructors in a So­
viet spy training school. Directed 
by Dave Thomas of SCTV, The 
Experts is sure to provide an in­
teresting surprise or two.
Tri-Star Pictures hasn’t been 
rocking the box office lately, so 
the hope is that some of their fall 
releases will spark excitement. 
Upcoming pictures include
Sweet Hearts Dance, a romantic 
comedy starring a wonderful 
ensemble cast of Don{Miami 
Vzce)Johnson, Susan(i3wZZ 
Durham)Sa.ra.ndon, 
Jeff{Something WiZcODaniels 
and Elizabeth(A6ow£ Last 
Night... )Perkins; Bat 21, a mili­
tary action-drama starring Gene 
Hackman as a downed pilot and 
Danny Glover as a helicopter 
jockey; High Spirits, a super­
natural comedy of ghosts and 
romance starring Steve Gutten- 
berg, Daryl Hannah and Peter 
O’Toole; and my personal favor­
ite high-concept film, Chances 
Are, starring Cybill Shepherd 
as the widowed mother of Mary 
StuartOSome Kind Of Wonder- 
/w/)Masterson and Robert 
Downey, Jr. as the reincarnation 
of her late husband. Only one 
problem, that being that 
Downey’s character is only 25 
and is the boyfriend of 
Masterson’s. It may sound a bit 
on the inane side, but these 
people (Downey and Shepherd) 
have some real chemistry going 
for them and they look 
mahvelous together.
Orion Pictures has had a few 
big releases this summer, nota­
bly Colors and Bull Durham, 
and they’re going strong with 
Married to the Mob in its first 
weeks in the theaters. By the 
end of September, we should 
have the premiere of Eight Men 
Out in Pittsburgh; and none too 
soon. This long-awaited adapta­
tion of the Elliot Asinof novel 
deals with the infamous 1919 
“Black Sox” who conspired to 
throw the World Series, and
photo courtesy Tri-Star Pictures
Cybill Shepherd and Robert Downey in Chances Are
stars John Cusack, Charlie 
Sheen and Christopher Lloyd. 
Also coming from Orion is Fare­
well To The King, ajungle drama 
set in World War II Borneo and 
starring Nick Nolte.
United Artists only has one 
major film up for release in the 
next two months, but it’s a
doozie. Betrayed is the Costa- 
Gavras film starring Debra 
Winger and Tom Berenger that 
takes a hard look at the ultrar­
ight terrorist movements in the 
heartland of America. This film 
is straight from the headlines 
and is loosely based on the case

Now that all the big studios 
are running out of indoor-bull- 
stuff junk to throw up on the 
screen, the rest of the summer 
belongs to pure dee solid drive- 
in releases. Here’s your complete 
A to Z Drive-In Guide to the 
Stuff I Can’t Wait to See. All 
these pictures are real. I didn’t 
make any of em up.
“Angel III: The Final Chap­
ter”: The original high-school- 
student-by-day, hooker-by-night 
is now 26 years old, living in 
$ew York, but goes back to El 
Lay to get involved with Rich­
ard “Shaft” Roundtree and try 
1» find her dead mother. A brand- 
tfew bimbo in this one.
' “Bimbo Barbeque”: The ad­
vertising for this sequel to 
“Assault of the Killer Bimbos” 
says it all: “Their Second Full 
Frontal Assault.”
“Bloodscape”: I’m quoting: “A 
boy goes our for pizza during his 
family’s housewarming in a 
suburban apartment block, only 
t6 find them gone when he re­
turns, victims of a deadly gang.” 
: “Bloodstone”: “The largest 
ruby in history. The deadliest 
Vrllain in the world. The clumsi­
est detective on earth. The 
smartest couple in India. The 
biggest adventure of the cen- 
tftry is about to begin...” I can’t 
wait.
2 “The Chair”: A con was fried 
in the electric chair 20 years ago 
by rioting prisoners, and now 
his ghost is back for revenge on 
the guard who refused to come 
to his aid. Starring James Coco.
“Deathblow“: The first file to 
team the immortal talents of 
Frank Stallone, Jerry Van 
Dyke,, and Howard Hughes’ life- 
lpnggirlfriend, Terry Moore. The 
jjlot: ‘'Victimized women take re­
venge on their attackers in a 
ijiost unusual way.”
! “Death Spa”: Some guys in 
Seattle tell me this is a puke-a- 
rama. The ad says: “You’ll sweat 
.b’lood.”! “Devil Woman”: The title role 
is played by Carrie Leigh, the 
scary lookin lipstick lizard who’s 
suing Hugh Hefner for kicking 
her out of the Playboy Mansion. 
The plot: “A young woman learns 
that her brother’s lover is the 
resurrected mother of the Anti­
christ.”
“Fire With Fire”: White-bread 
airhead college girls take a va­
cation to Mexico and get held 
hostage by a brutal and sadistic 
South America drug dealer 
(Oliver Reed) while waiting for 
Robert Vaughn to put on his 
Beatle boots and wind-breaker 
and come get em out.
“Flesh Eater”: Bill Hinzman,
the last guy to turn zombie in 
the classic “Night of the Living 
Dead,” in a rare screen appear­
ance. As the ad says, “He lived. 
He died. He’s back. And he’s 
hungry!”
“The Fly 2:The Insect Awak­
ens”: The good news is the best 
horror flick of the 80s will live 
again. The bad news: David 
Cronen­
berg, the •
batta.
“Pin”: A brotherN and sister 
who keep the memory of their 
ventriloquist father alive by 
keeping his dummy around.
“Piranha Women”: The ad 
says, “Don’t get them wet!”
“Purgatory”: “Arrested 7,000 
miles from home. Sentenced for 
a crime she did not commit. Carly 
mmmmmammmm Amold facesthe great chal-SIS: Joe-BobGoes p\t£
have any- • _ —. - »from the
thing to do * |0 TtlG DflVG"1!!! I prison called 
with it. • »Purgatory.”“Hallow- ••••••••••••••••••••• • Action. Star-
een IV’: They learned their les- ring Tanya “Sheena Queen of
son about sequels after “Hallow­
een III” turkeyed out, so Donald 
Pleasance is back, along with 
the original slasher, Michael 
Meyers. Still no Jamie Lee Cur­
tis, though.
“Howling IV’: “The original 
nightmare.” They refuse to quit.
“Hunted to Death”: You’ll be 
interested to know that it has 
“More passion that ‘The Godfa­
ther’! More Majesty than ‘Dr. 
Zhivago’! More epic war action 
than ‘Lawrence of Arabia’!” And 
it stars — who else — Michael 
Stamatakis and Catherine 
Koutrovis.
“I Married a Vampire”: The 
story of a small-town girl who 
goes to Boston to make it on her 
own, only to be cheated, 
swindled, ripped off by a reli­
gious cult, raped, and introduced 
to a 100-year-old vampire.
“Lurkers”: The story of a little 
girl, burned with an iron, who 
grows up to play the cello and be 
tormented by her dead mother. 
The critic for Variety, the trade 
paper, calls it “the terrifying 
story of a little girl forced to 
grow up with a mother who can’t 
act.”
“Man Eaters”: An anthropolo­
gist is shipwrecked on an island 
inhabited by beautiful cannibal 
women.“Midnight Movie Massacre”: 
Includes a scene where a 300- 
pound transvestite eats a space 
monster.
“The Order of the Black 
Eagle”: Action sequel “Unmask­
ing the Idol,” about a secret agent 
with a baboon sidekick who tries 
to stop an evil army from un­
freezing the body of Adolf Hitler 
and using stolen lasers to de­
stroy the world’s satellites.
“Phoenix — The Warrior”: 
After-the-nukes story about a 
world populated only by beauti­
ful “savage” women in Zebra skin 
loincloths, and their attempts to 
perpetuate the race with a sperm 
bank. Starring Persis Kham-
the Jungle” Roberts.
“Redneck Zombies”: “Tobacco 
Chewin’, Gut Chompin’, Canni­
bal Kinfolk from Hell!... Filmed 
in Entrail Vision.”
“Savage Beach”: Fourth in the 
“Malibu Express” breasts-and- 
machine-guns series, a tale of 
Hawaiian naval intelligence 
officers searching for $25 billion 
in gold hidden by the Japanese 
at the end of World War II. Star­
ring Dona “Yes, These Are Real” 
Speir.
“Sex Police”: “In 1995, when 
sex between unmarried persons 
is against the law, a rookie must 
save his teen-age brother and 
the world from the ruthless 
Sexual Authority.”
“Slime City”: Cult horror flick, 
rarely seen outside New York, 
about an apartment building full 
of monsters who need human 
bodies to contain their slime 
organs. The newspaper Variety 
has seen it and calls it “repul­
sive.”
“State Park”: “No one will be 
admitted after the bear steals 
the bulldozer.” By the director of
“Screwballs.”
“Terror Squad”: Adventure 
story about Libyan terrorists 
invading Kokomo, Indiana and 
occupying the local nuclear 
plant. Starring Chuck Connors.
“Uninvited”: Straight from 
the plot outline: “A Fugitive Wall 
Street arbitrageur finds there’s 
more to worry about than the 
SEC — a killer cat has found its 
way on board his luxury yacht.”
“Zombie Brigade”: Australian 
zombie picture about a small 
town that sells off the land the 
Vietnam vets are buried on so 
that a Japanese company can 
build a “Robotman” theme park.
In the meantime, everybody 
needs to check out “Phantasm
II,” which is the sequel it took 
Don Coscarelli nine years to 
make, and which has three flying 
silver balls instead of the one in 
the original flick, and a severed 
hand instead of a levitating 
severed finger. Otherwise, it’s 
the same deal—The Tall Man is 
back, taking corpses down to his 
mortuary and turning em into 
killer midget monks. We’ve got 
exploding houses, ESP, Crema­
torium Fu, a four-barreled 
sawed-off shotgun, Flam­
ethrower Fu, 10 nekkid breasts, 
dwarf tossing, embalming 
needles plunged through vari­
ous parts of various bodies, ear- 
lopping, forehead-drilling, wrist- 
hacking, bimbo-flinging, 
Grandma-bashing, devil sex, 
and the most terrifying scene 
I’ve ever witnessed — a per­
fectly decent 1971 Hemi Cuda 
flippin over, landing on its roof 
and bustin into flame. I cried for 
two hours. It’s AMAZING what 
they’ll let these stunt people do 
for the sake of a movie.
Four stars. Check it out twice.
Last Temptation “worth 
seeing” at King’s Court
continued from page 9
long. It runs about two hours 
and forty-five minutes but it 
seems longer. It is not boring
— the action is smooth — but 
there’s just a lot of ground to 
cover and Scorcese does it as 
well as he can. It is rated ‘R’ 
and is somewhat graphic — 
but in this case the justifica­
tion of on-screen violence is 
fairly evident; after all, it is a 
violent story with a violent 
conclusion. This is not Sun­
day school Christianity; the 
Jesus of Last Temptation 
fights and bleeds and gets dirt 
under his fingernails.
In the last analysis, 
whether or not you spend your 
$4.50 to see The Last Tempta­
tion Of Christ depends on you. 
It’s not blasphemy or heresy; 
nobody is going to wave a Bible
in your face and tell you your 
soul is condemned to hell if 
you see this movie. It is, in 
fact, an insightful, impas­
sioned and intriguing consid­
eration of what Jesus and his 
associates might have been 
like, and how he and they 
have passed down their influ­
ence over the past two thou­
sand years. If you aren’t afraid 
to open your eyes and see, 
and think, then go see Last 
Temptation. Find out for your­
self.
The Last Temptation Of 
Christ, directed by Martin 
Scorsese, starring Willem 
Dafoe, music by Peter Gab­
riel, playing at the King’s 
Court in Oakland at 6807

That’s the rundown; now

THIS WEEK IN DH2210
Thursday, September 8 
Jean de Florette
This film was hailed as “a cinematic masterpiece” in its 
theatrical release last year. It won seven of the French equiva­
lents of the Academy Awards and took Cannes by storm. The 
story of a simple French fanner and his battle against Nature 
and neighbors, Jean de Florette is possibly the best and cer­
tainly the most beautiful foreign film of the decade. The sequel,' 
Manon bf the Spring, shows next week.
At: 6, 8,10 pm
Friday, September 9 
Moonstruck
A romantic comedy in the old style, Moonstruck stars Cher 
and Nicolas Cage as star-crossed lovers in modern-day Brooklyn, 
victims of the lunacy that has afflicted lovers for centuries. 
Olympia Dukakis co-stars as Cher’s mother—she received the 
Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for the role. Take a friend.
At: 6, 8,10 pm, 12 midnight
Saturday, September 10
Dirty Dancing
Shimmy shimmy wama wama shake — how do you call your 
loverboy? The sleeper hit of last summer that inspired its very 
own concert tour, Dirty Dancing has spun off more sound­
tracks, themed more parties and caused more back injuries 
than any other movie in recent memory. Jennifer Grey and 
Patrick Swazye are kinda cute, and the music is fun. Wear 
comfy shoes.
At: 6, 8, 10 pm, 12 midnight
Sunday, September 11
Commando
Ahmold Iz Bahck! The inimitable Schwarzenegger fights 
terrorists, rescues his daughter, flexes his pecs, causes trouble 
in an airport, uses automatic weapons like Raid Ant & Roach 
Spray, utters the unforgettable line, “I like you, Scully. You’re 
funny. That’s why I’m going to kill you last..kills Scully by 
dropping him off a cliff — head first — and on the whole simply 
behaves like the cultural icon and upstanding citizen he is.

Running Man on the 17th (Saturday), Raw Deal on the 18th, 
and The Terminator on the 25th. He told us he’d be back.

Check out the Forbes 
Gallery: Art for fun’s saké
By JULIETTE BORDA
Tartan Staffwriter
Ever notice that little gray 
building on the corner of Marga­
ret Morrison Street and Forbes 
Avenue? If you’re not in the 
College of Fine Arts, you proba­
bly visit the Forbes Gallery about 
as often as a paintingmajorpulls 
an all-nighter at UCC. Some 
things Mom never told you: the 
Forbes gallery is not a club that 
requires dues fees, a funny hair­
cut or a special major in order to 
be admitted. It is an organiza­
tion funded by YOUR Student 
Activities Fee, that features 
student work paintings, draw­
ings, prints, sculpture, video, 
installations, poetry readings, 
and sometimes unusual combi­
nations of these categories.
The first floor of the building 
that now houses the gallery was 
the Woodlawn Pharmacy until 
1969, when a gallery for Carne­
gie Mellon students was estab­
lished. In 1976, it was named 
the Forbes Street Gallery. At 
that time, student exhibits 
usually followed themes: a 
glassblowing show, a freshman 
and sophomore show, and a stage 
design show were just a few. 
Today, shows during the fall 
semester are usually works by 
Junior level art majors, and 
seniors exhibit during the sec­
ond semester. The shows change 
weekly.
Tuesday night gallery open­
ings provide a pre-hump-day 
outlet and a very informal at­
mosphere (as well as complimen­
tary refreshments) for students 
(and the public) who are inter­
ested in seeing what student 
artists do all day. You’re still 
wondering what people do at the 
gallery openings — ritualistic 
chants? sacrificial offerings of 
art to the Gods? nude slam- 
dancing? Yes, a bit of each, in 
addition to admiring the stuff on 
the walls and mingling amongst 
old and new acquaintances. If 
you’re pressed for time on a 
Tuesday night, you may visit 
the gallery during the week. Ons 
of the advantages to dropping, 
by during the day is being able, 
to view the art from across the 
room without peering between 
heads and shoulders.
The Annual Alumni Show 
runs from September 6-21. The 
shared element in this show is 
the fact that all the artistes are 
Carnegie Mellon Graduates. The 
works on display run the gamut 
from drawing to sculpture and 
painting to fiber weavings. They 
are varied in media, size, an,4 
the artist’s intent. The show pro­
vides the opportunity to see 
directions that fourteen Carne­
gie Mellon graduates have cho­
sen to pursue — a welcomed 
change from the student work 
that is influenced primarily by 
its immediate surroundings. r
One of Carnegie Mellon’s 
best-kept secrets: The Forbes 
Gallery. Tuesday Night open­
ings are from 7 until 9 pm; hours 
are Tuesday through Saturday
11 am until 7 pm, Sunday 12 
until 5 pm.

Here comes Guilty Children
By AMANDA COHEN
Tàrtan Staffwriter
An improvisation troupe from 
Boston will be performing in the 
Wherrett Room this Friday. See 
them. If it’s the last thing you 
do, see them. They are Guilty 
Children, and they are the best 
thing to happen to improv com- 
|edy since The Second City, 
j The core of an improv group 
is, of course, the improvisation, 
and Guilty Children can put the 
best of them to shame. Their 
irk is super-improvisation: 
ter than a speeding one-liner 
:d more powerful than George 
¡Matter's Comedy Club. They 
highly physical and use every 
ich of the performing space, 
lether it be a three-by-six foot. 
iatform or a grand concert hall 
tge.
Like Chicago’s Second City, ’ 
ston’s Guilty Children now 
ive a home-based troupe and a 
»uring troupe. The original 
embers were assembled in the 
[1 of 1983 from a workshop 
«inducted by Phil Lebovits, who 
iirected the group while also 
participating as a guilty child.
[ nder Phil’s direction they 
toured all over the Northeast, 
and even for a video on MTV.
[ ut unlike Second City’s tour­
ing troupe, Guilty Children’s 
3 low is mainly composed of 
improvised scenes rather than 
3 d sketches that have been 
handed down through the gen­
erations.
In addition to the standard 
improv structures, the Children 
bave invented their own games,
the most impressive of which is 
their version of the game show 
Jeopardy. The audience yells out 
the answers, and the panel has 
to come up with the questions, 
with points going to the funniest 
instead of the most accurate. 
Too bad they don’t grade exams 
that way.
Another game has the entire 
group improvising scenes that 
give hints to make one member 
guess the names of items chosen 
while he was sequestered back­
stage. Picture one poor fellow 
trying to figure out “a rubber- 
handled spatula” from clues 
being improvised around him.
Guilty Children’s prepared 
sketch repertoire changes every 
year, but past gems have in­
cluded a group therapy session 
moderated by Dr. Seuss (com­
plete with narrator), Purple 
Dawn (Prince vs. a commie in­
vasion), and a song about the 
President called “Let’s Do the 
Ronnie” (“First you lean to the 
right, then you lean to the 
right...”). Maybe you had to be 
there.
But you can be there this Fri­
day. AB Coffeehouse is fortu­
nate enough to be hosting Guilty 
Children’s very first Pittsburgh 
appearance. So come see history 
being made. Come see comedy 
being made. Come see Guilty 
Children.
Guilty Children will be ap­
pearing on Friday, September 
9th in the Wherrett Room at 8 
pm. For further information call 
the Skibo Info Desk at.x2107 or

he average freshman’s journey to campus is a long 
one, made far longer by the tirade of college pointers 
offered by his protective parents. He arrives at Carnegie 
Mellon greeted by a plethora of overenthusiastic freshman 
counsellors, resident assistants, and confusing though occa­
sionally educational (if you know where to look) literature. 
Based on extensive research, the average freshman agenda has 
been determined to look somewhat like this:
»Arrive on campus.
• Stand in line at Kiltie trying to look nonchalant.
•Parents appear, nonchalance plans devastated.
• Search for the dorm with the “unique architectural style.”
«Arrive at Hamerschlag.
•Pick up keys.
•Console hysterical mother while father grabs a catalog, 
flipping to “Refund Policy.”
•Attempt to open room door.
•Fail.
•Get the right set of keys.
•Open room.
• Parents look in, father muttering something about “$17,000,” 
mother reaching for the can of Raid.
•Drive around for an hour looking for a parking space.
•Double park, unload car and U-Haul onto sidewalk.
•Visualize how impressive your 23” Hitatchi color console TV 
stereo entertainment center will look against those blue ce­
ment block walls.

By ALBRE CHT T. POWELL
Tartan Photography Editor 
Wearing two different hats, one 
of Student Ombudsman and the 
other as Coordinator of Special 
Projects, Michael Murphy—he 
prefers just plain Mike — has 
two primary goals: the first, to 
help students. The second, to 
help students.
Wait, you say, how can this be? 
As Student Ombudsman, he is a
“I assist students in using the system, and 
working within the system,” says Murphy.
person to turn to when you don’t 
know where to go. A first step in 
getting a problem solved, or a 
place to complain with unsatis­
factory results. As Coordinator 
of Special Projects, he works on 
projects designed to enhance the 
quality of life on campus. He is 
an administrator whose primary 
concern is for the student.
An ombudsman, according to 
American Heritage, is “a gov­
ernment official who investi­
gates citizen’s complaints 
against the government or its 
functionaries.” Murphy sees 
himself in a little less “techni­
cal” light. He’s just there to help 
students.
Whenever a student has a prob­
lem or concern, and doesn’t know 
where to turn, he can go to 
Murphy, who will point him in 
the right direction. If the stu­
dent has had some problems that 
were not rectified satisfactorily, 
Murphy can help.
“I assist students in using the 
system, and working within the 
system. It’s sort of the ‘How 
should I go about solving this,’ a 
game plan, if you will.” Any time
a student talks to Murphy, the 
conversation is strictly confiden­
tial. He can be reached at 268- 
2991.
Murphy’s other job, Coordina­
tor of Special Projects, is just as 
important. Currently, he is as­
sisting in over two dozen proj­
ects such as working with Bruce 
Gerson, Sports Information 
Director, and the athletics de­
partment for “On the Road in 
’88” — the 
Tartan foot­
ball team’s 
current 
theme. 
Murphy 
and Gerson 
are trying to 
help foster 
campus 
spirit and 
unity by ar- 
ranging 
transporta­
tion to and 
from the 
games, 
giveaways, 
prizes, and 
other sun­
dries to help 
get students 
to the
games.
Other 
projects in­
clude: work­
ing with 
faculty sen­
ate for
greater fac­
ulty and student interaction, 
developing a parents’ newslet­
ter of campus events and activi­
ties, working with Anne Witch- 
ner, the Director of Student 
Activities, on student leadership 
and development, creating a peer 
education net­
work committee 
on alcohol and 
drug education 
(known as 
CADE), and ad­
dressing the 
need for greater 
awareness with 
minority issues
— to name a 
few. “It’s sort of 
whatever comes 
along or what­
ever is needed,” 
says Murphy.
When asked about his views of 
Carnegie Mellon, he says, “I am 
amazed at the vitality and com­
mitment of the student body. 
And the faculty, for that matter. 
People here are struck with so 
much enthusiasm with all the 
change that’s going on, it’s 
amazing.”
Murphy goes on to say that he 
really appreciates how both 
students and faculty seem ori­
ented to suggest broad-based 
improvements, many of which 
will not affect them. Such things 
as quality of life issues are im­
portant. “Things take time. 
Many of the students who par­
ticipated on the Quality of Life 
student task force are no longer 
around, but their ideas and vi­
sions will be of advantage to 
future students.”
The position of ombudsman is 
a relatively new one at Carnegie 
Mellon. It was instituted last 
year as an experiment, and found 
to be successful. Dan Corbett, a 
then-part-time SUPA student, 
was appointed by President 
Cyert to address student needs. 
Corbett, who was actively in­
volved with the Quality of Stu­
dent Life task force, said that 
this type of position, “an admin­
istrator that students can really 
relate to,” was really needed on 
campus.
Corbett went on to say that 
students are perhaps the most 
important part of Carnegie 
Mellon, and they need a very 
clear cut inroad into the system. 
Murphy plans to continue much 
of the work Corbett began.
Murphy got his Bachelors 
degree in Economics from the 
University of Virginia, in 1981, 
received a masters in Counsel­
ing and Higher Education in 
1982, and came to Carnegie 
Mellon the same year.He worked 
until 1985 as Assistant Dean of 
Student Affairs and an Area 
Coordinator on the Hill (Murphy 
smiled, “The Hill—best place to 
be!”) He earned a Masters in 
Public Management from SUPA 
in 1985, and became Assistant

“It never really occurred to me 
to stay here....I’ve always moved 
around a lot,” he says. Murphy 
took his new position on July 1 
of this year. “One of the best 
things about the position is that 
a lot of it is determined by stu­
dents.” He was given no agenda 
of what direction to go. It was a 
“very open ended job descrip­
tion, with lots of opportunity,” 
he says.
When asked whether he felt 
this would be a long-term job, 
Murphy replied, “Well, I think 
that the position needs a long­
term commitment. You need 
someone who will see projects 
through. I like this place, both 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mel­
lon.”
“Besides, we [my wife Nancy, 
my cat Taylor, and I] just bought 
a house, and we really like it 
here. Yeah, I’ll be around for a 
while,” he smiles.
Counseling available to all
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Features Editor
“We’d like to let everyone 
know we’re here,” says Lorrie 
Rabin, the Director of Carne­
gie Mellon’s Counseling and 
Student Development Center. 
Judging by last year’s statis­
tics — 3000 hours of one-on- 
one counseling scheduled 
with 500 students served—it 
doesn’t look like Rabin has 
much to worry about.
The CSDC provides confi­
dential counseling for a 
number of problems ranging 
from eating disorders to diffi­
culties with boyfriends and 
girlfriends. Free counseling 
is available to any member of 
the CMU community.
In addition to one-on-one 
counseling, the CSDC offers 
workshops on topics such as 
^depression, stereotypes, and
stress management. Last 
year, these workshops 
reached about 2000 students.
Rabin stresses that the coun­
seling center is available to 
everyone."We’re widely used. 
We see problems ranging from 
very serious to the everyday.”
The newly-renovated center 
boasts two new faces. Glen 
Sherman, recently of the 
University of Pittsburgh, is a 
new senior staff consultant. 
The other new counselor is 
Ed Lilly, previously with 
Student Affairs. “Ed has a 
background in counseling and 
we’re very pleased to have 
him,” says Rabin.
To reach the counseling cen­
ter, which is located in the 
bottom of the E tower of 
Morewood Gardens, call ex­
tension 2922. A staff member 
is on call 24 hours a day. À

Murphy wanted a job with a

and applied at the last minute.

Food is a necessity. Unfor­
tunately, it is not always 
cheap, and often requires a 
bit of preparation and imagi­
nation, both 
of which can 
betime-con- 
s u m i ng .
CMU often 
requirestoo 
much time 
to comforta­
bly devote 
energy to 
food, so stu­
dents often 
trust to CMDS to take care of 
that for them.
Some brave souls who take 
suchmatters as food into their 
own hands, upon getting 
strapped for time, panic and 
rely on the five pre-prepared 
food groups: pizza, nachos, 
Chinese (subdivided into 
Takeout and Delivered), caf­
feine, and junk. Others rely 
on old standards, such as spa­
ghetti, which are cheap, quick,
and easy, but get boring after 
about a month.
While I can’t offer you some 
more time (hey, I’m a student, 
too!), I can take 
care of some of 
the imagina­
tion for you by 
offering cheap, 
easy, interest­
ing variations 
on those old 
standards. 
Spaghetti 
Let’s start 
with spaghetti, 
since it’s one of those nice things 
you dorm residents can cook in a 
hot pot without getting your RA 
mad.
Here’s a refresher on how to 
make spaghetti: Fill pot with 
water, add a bit of salt or oil to 
keep the spaghetti noodles from 
sticking to each other, and heat. 
When the water reaches a roll­
ing boil, put the noodles in (if 
you’re dealing with a hot pot, 
you may want to break them in
half) and leave them there until 
tender. Drain the water from 
the noodles. Rinse them with 
cold water to remove excess 
starch and stop them from cook­
ing. Heat sauce of your choice 
and pour over spaghetti.
A variation for those who like 
vegetables: Julienne (chop into 
matchstick-size pieces) carrots, 
zucchini, or the vegetables of 
your choice. Sautee lightly in 
olive oil (possibly difficult in a 
hot-pot) with basil, and oreg­
ano. Toss with spaghetti, a little 
more olive oil and parmesan 
cheese. A variation on this vari­
ation: if you have chicken left 
over from a previous lunch or 
dinner, julienne the leftovers and 
throw them in too.
Some more variations:
Mix your still-hot spaghetti (or 
other pasta shape) with grated 
cheese or cottage cheese.
Rinse the noodles until thor­
oughly cold, and toss them in a 
salad (or even just with toma­
toes and olives) with Italian
dressing.
Mix your spaghetti ( warm 
or cold) with flaked tuna fish, 
grated mozzarella or Swiss, 
tomatoes, and olive oil. 
Peanut Butter Cookies 
I think you get the idea. 
For dessert, you may even 
want to make these cookies, 
which are quick and easy 
and feature another low- 
prep standby: peanut butter.
• 1 cup peanut butter
•1 egg• 1 cup sugar
• 1 teaspoon vanilla 
Combine all the ingredi­
ents. Form into 1-inch di­
ameter balls. Flatten each 
ball with a fork (twice, to 
form a criss-cross pattern 
on the cookie) on an un­
greased cookie sheet. The 
oil ifi the peanut butter will 
keep them from sticking to 
the pan. Bake at 350 de­
grees for about 10 minutes.

AC addresses literacy
By DENISE A. TROLL
Special to The Tartan
This article¦ is the first of a 
series addressing the state of 
computer literacy at Carnegie 
Mellon. Future articles will dis­
cuss the long-term goals of Aca­
demic Computing’s Documenta­
tion and Training and present 
the typical student’s view of CMU 
computing systems.
Denise Troll is the Documenta­
tion and Training Coordinator 
for Academic Computing. —Ed.
Central computing at Carne­
gie Mellon is managed by Com­
puting Systems, a unit of the 
Academic Services Division. 
Computing Systems is composed 
of three departments: Academic 
Computing, Network Services & 
Data Communication, and 
Computing Systems. While the 
three departments share the 
responsibility for delivering 
computing services to the CMU 
campus, it is Academic Comput­
ing which is the primary liason 
between Computing Services 
and the user community.
Academic Computing took
steps over the summer to im­
prove and coordinate its docu­
mentation and training services.
Computer
literacy
first of a series
We hope to provide more up-to- 
date service, to better facilitate 
users’ understanding and access 
to this service, and to establish 
channels for user feedback so 
that we can continue to develop 
documentation and training that 
meet the needs of the campus 
community.
To be responsive to users’ 
needs, we must know what those 
needs are. In a general way it is 
clear that users want a stable 
system, easy-to-use software and 
hardware, printing and consult­
ing services, and up-to-date 
documentation and training

•Meet your roommate, check 
I out his stuff, begin to worry about

I paired up with a violent anar- 
I chist hacker who showers only

i you family. Discuss with mother

; For returning students, how- 
ever, campus looks decidedly 
; different. You already know the 
I secret formulas necessary to 
navigate the halls of Morewood 
j and Wean, the hideousness of 
; Skibo and Donner no longer
shock you, and your body has 
built up an immunity to CMDS 
food, making dinner a tolerable, 
if not exactly enjoyable experi­
ence. After discussing with your 
roommate all the items you will 
need to purchase to make your 
room one of the finest on cam­
pus, your activities probably look 
something like this:
•The Grand Slam Campus 
Social Tour. This involves visit­
ing every person you ever met in 
their room, office, apartment or 
fraternity and trying to assimi­
late, in a matter of hours, the 
aggregate activities of several 
dozen people over the course of 
the last three months.
•Gathering a large group of 
these people, and heading to­
ward Oakland or someone’s 
apartment to avoid eating at 
Kiltie for as long as possible. O’s 
fries are a definite must for those 
who have forgotten just how 
horrible it is possible to feel.
•Returning to your room late 
that night to remember just how 
much you don’t like your 
roommate’s boyfriend, and 
scheming a devious plan to lock 
them out at the next opportu­
nity.
•The Registrar. Returning to 
classes undoubtedly means the
odyssey to the registrar’s tent, 
your department, your adviser 
and back to the tent in order to 
drop and re-add the four classes 
for which the times changed and 
finally determining that the only 
way you’ll graduate is if you 
switch from Industrial Manage­
ment to Modern French.
• Class. Realizing that first day 
that the psychotic guy who lives 
down the hall is in five of your 
six classes, has switched to your 
major, and has decided he wants 
to go out with you. Run scream­
ing to you roommate in the grill 
at lunch and wonder why, on top 
of all this, that you’re actually 
eating a Tartan burger.
•Homework. Calculate your 
average monthly salary over the 
summer, the average cost of each 
class, your workload, and the 
minimum hours of sleep on 
which a person can survive, and 
determine that dropping out of 
school and working at the Giant 
Eagle would increase your qual­
ity of life significantly.
• Remembering that despite all 
that, you did manage to have a 
reasonably good time last year.
•Embarking on a plan to have 
an even better time this year by 
blowing off the first econ assign­
ment and going dancing instead.

Academic Computing hopes to increase literacy through documentation, training
a.UorU1uv p3.I 8l'u *^
However, the details about the 
specific academic computing 
that users are required to do 
and the needs that this require­
ment generates are more diffi­
cult to identify.
Documentation and Training 
staff members worked this 
summer to address the obvious 
general needs that users have 
with regard to computer educa­
tion. In addition, we feel that we 
have devised a way to learn more 
about these general needs and 
what specific academic comput­
ing needs exist in relation to 
documentation and training.
We see satisfying the basic 
needs for documentation and 
training about text editing, elec­
tronic mail, file transfer and 
printing as a first step, a short­
term goal. Satisfying the needs 
for documentation and training 
about specific online academic 
activities is a second step — a 
long-term goal — that we can­
not achieve until we know what 
such users want. This article 
discusses what we have done to 
achieve our short-term goal. The 
second part of this series will 
address what we are doing to 
achieve our long-term goal.
The short-term documentation 
objective is to provide up-to-date 
manuals, handouts, and online 
help for the centrally supported 
systems and software.
This summer the Documenta­
tion and Training staff recruited 
several student writers to help 
us keep up with the demand for 
up-to-date documents. These 
writers are helping revise obso­
lete documents and prepare new

student consultants working 
for Academic Computing, 
User Training Modules — 
“UTMs” for short — present 
the concepts and capabilities 
of different applications and 
procedures integral to com­
puting at Carnegie Mellon.
Examples of available 
UTMs are: Introduction to the 
VAX, Introduction to UNIX, 
The Andrew Help System,
help on utms for a current list 
of titles and filenames.
At the end of each UTM is an 
evaluation form asking users 
to rate the UTM itself and the 
“do-it-yourself’ approach to 
training. Users are also asked 
to comment on what “com-
ones. Three new manuals were 
completed this summer, and 
more are underway.
To better organize and control 
documentation, we have inven­
toried all of the hardcopy docu­
ments in the public clusters, and 
we are purchasing or producing 
documents that users requested. 
We have also made explicit ar­
rangements with the consult­
ants who work in the clusters to 
see that the bins of handouts are 
never empty, and to report hand­
outs that are no longer accurate. 
This fall we will be revising the 
handouts.
To facilitate users’ access to 
the documents, we have begun 
to put new or revised versions of 
locally-produced manuals and 
handouts on Andrew.
The short-term training objec­
tive is to provide the user com­
munity with basic instruction in 
the centrally-supported systems 
and popular software. Over the
Printing online documents
Academic Computing has 
begun to put new or revised 
versions of locally-produced 
manuals and handouts on An­
drew in the directory usr/lo­
cal/doc.
To access the documents, 
type the following in your 
typescript window: 
cd usr/local/doc 
Is
A listing of all the documents 
currently online will appear. 
The majority of these docu­
ments fall into two catego­
ries:
•Those documents with file­
names ending in “.PS” are 
postscript files, which means 
you can print them on any 
Andrew printer. Just type the 
command 
print -Tnative -Sprin-
tername file 
where printername is the 
name of the Andrew printer 
you wi sh to print on and file is 
the name of the postscript file, 
including the “.PS” suffix.
•Those documents with file­
names ending in “.doc” are EZ 
files. To print them, just type 
the command
ezprint file 
where file is the filename of 
the document, including the 
“.doc” suffix.
The only new manual that is 
not available in /usr/local/doc 
is “The VTJI User’s Guide,” 
which is too large and con­
tains too many pictures for 
users to print it conveniently. 
“The VUI User’s Guide” can 
be purchased in the CMU 
Computer Store.
summer, we organized our train­
ing program by designating 
trainers who meet regularly to 
discuss issues related to train­
ing, and by developing a promo­
tional agenda to advertise our
training ses- ___________
sions to three 
audiences: stu­
dents, faculty, 
and staff.
Student train­
ing will be adver­
tised on large posters in the 
clusters and across campus, on 
the “announce” bulletin board 
on Andrew, and in Cursor, Aca­
demic Computing’s monthly 
newsletter. We are also creating 
a training help file that lists the 
complete training schedule for 
the semester; you will soon be 
able to access this file by typing 
“help training” on Andrew or 
VAX-B.
A new training session entitled 
“How to Read Computer Docu­
mentation” will be offered this 
fall as part of Academic 
Computing’s efforts to coordi­
nate documentation and train-
ACADEMIC
COMPUTING
ing. Experience indicates that 
many users do not read the avail­
able documents, either because 
they do not know they are avail­
able, cannot find them, don’t 
know how to use them, or choose 
____________ to ask the con­
sultant or ad­
visor instead.
Although we 
will continue 
to develop the 
training pro­
gram, we know that, because of 
scheduling conflicts and a lack 
of resources, we cannot provide 
every user on campus with per­
sonal instruction. Therefore, 
users must turn to documenta­
tion for guidance. We are work­
ing to improve the documents 
and to train users how to locate 
and use them. We are currently 
working on the following proj­
ects:
°To solve the problem of users 
not knowing what documents 
are available where, we will be 
preparing an easy-to-use data­
base on Andrew to which all 
users will have access. Users

will be able to query the data­
base for documents on each of 
the supported systems and ap­
plications. When the documen­
tation component of the data­
base is completed, we plan to 
add information on training and 
consulting.
•To solve the problem of sched­
uling training sessions to meet 
the needs of 7000 users, we are 
exploring audiotape, videotape, 
interactive videodisk and online 
tutorials as alternative ap­
proaches to personal instruction. 
These avenues offer a time- and 
cost-effective method for users 
to proceed at their own pace.
•To encourage users to become 
stronger computer users and
hence independent of consult­
ants, we are starting a campaign 
to emphasize user initiative in 
achieving computer literacy. 
This campaign encompasses 
documentation, training and 
user feedback. Our first major 
step is to provide do-it-yourself 
training via hardcopy documents 
called User Training Modules 
(UTMs).
Much progress has been made 
this summer in accomplishing 
our short-term goals, but we 
know that there is much more 
work still to be done — particu­
larly in regard to specific aca­
demic uses of computing. Our 
long-term goal along these lines 
will be discussed next week.

It was a relatively bright 
and sunny Saturday after­
noon. A slight departure 
from the normal overcast 
grayness associated with a 
typical Pittsburgh day. But 
wh at th e h eck, wh en you’re 
up to your neck in early 
semester expenses like tui­
tion, books and food, any 
little hint that <cYes, it is a 
nice world” helps.
The game was already un­
der way. The football sea­
son opener. “Snyder passes 
to Barnyak. COMPLETE! 
The sophomore is off and 
running! He’s at the 15... 
the 10... the 5... TOUCH­
DOWN TARTANS!” the an­
nouncer boomed over the 
radio. “And that will bring 
these CMU fans to their 
feet. Yes sir! Both of those 
guys are having a whale of 
time at this, the first home 
game of the 1988 season!” I 
chuckled to myself as I lay 
in my bed after sleeping 
the morning away.
He continued, “And here’s 
the extra point attempt. 
And it’s GOOD! My oh my, 
those Tartan fans now have 
REALLY big smiles on 
their faces now...”
That is what I expected 
the first game to be like 
this year. I figured that 
since only a few people went 
to the football games on 
campus, who would possi­
bly attend a game out on 
the other side of the Fort 
Pitt Tunnels. To my sur­
prise and great satisfaction,
I was proven wrong. Out of 
an estimated 2,500 total 
attendance, about 1,800 
CMU fans went out to the 
game. Transportation was 
provided by the school in 
the form of six buses, each 
making two trips.
Sports Information Direc­
tor Bruce Gerson, the Pub­
lic Relations Department 
and the Athletic Depart­
ment worked hard all 
summer long to plan 
events, promotions and in­
crease overall “campus 
awareness” to help insure 
big crowds and good times 
for this year’s sporting 
events. Gerson admits 
however, that most of this 
energy is going into the 
football games.
“We’re not trying to slight 
the other sports,” Gerson 
said in an interview on the 
eve of the big game.
“When people come to the 
football games and get a 
program, they will see the 
other sports.” Every game 
program contains a profile 
of the other fall sports and 
their schedules.
Gerson commented, “I ex­
pect that we’ll see the larg­
est attendance of the sea­
son in this first weekend. If 
I’m wrong we can always 
get more buses.”
So, even with the Pirates 
over 7 games out of first 
place and no sight of an 
NBA team on the way for 
Pittsburgh, life is good at 
athletic fields all over the 
city where the Tartans are 
playing. So what if we do 
not really have a home field 
advantage, one can really 
see a lot of the city just 
going out to the games. Who 
knows, maybe you could get 
a job as a cabbie in your 
spare time come Spring.

The field was different for most, 
but the result was the same. In 
the season opener for both teams, 
three yards and a cloud of dust 
carried Carnegie Mellon to its 
first victory of the 1988 season, 
24-14 over cross-town rival 
Duquesne. The win was CMU’s 
seventh'straight victory over the 
Dukes.
The game also marked a home­
coming for Tartan Head Coach 
Rich Lackner who played at Mt. 
Lebanon in high school.
Three different running backs: 
Chris Hansen, Scott Barnyak, 
and Fran Bellante scored touch­
downs for Carnegie Mellon. The 
Tartans ran three times as often 
as they passed and cranked out 
twice as many yards on the 
ground on the way to the vic­
tory. This year’s money play is 
fullback left, a call CMU made 
many times. Left guard Russ 
Hann commented, “[The backs] 
know they can run behind us.”
The Tartans’ new surround­
ings did not seem to totally agree 
with them. Three starters were
forced out of the game due to 
injuries. In the first series, de­
fensive lineman Marvin Ger­
many was lost, followed by 
sophomore quarterback Billy 
Snyder and sophomore running 
back Robert Schmitt.
Coach Lackner refused to at­
tribute the problems to Mt. 
Lebanon’s artificial turf. “(Play­
ing on) turf doesn’t bother me, 
we’d better get used to it.” The 
effects of the injuries were less­
ened by the work of Carlos Ro­
driguez, Barnyak and others. 
Rodriguez is a role-player on the 
defensive line. “We may have 
three linemen, I consider Carlos 
as our ‘fourth,’ he can play any of 
the three positions,” said Lack­
ner.
Snyder may be out for the sea­
son due to torn ligaments in his 
left knee. A doctor’s report is 
pending. This came after a prom­
ising debut at starting quarter­
back. While in the game, the so­
phomore was nine of 15 for 98 
yards. This leaves the quarter­
back job open for either senior 
Laszlo Buda or freshman Steve

The Tartan Soccer team opened 
up the 1988 season last Sunday 
with Brandeis University. The 
team kept up the pace set by the 
football and cross-country teams 
by defeating the Brandeis 
Judges 2-1.
Brandeis jumped out to a quick 
lead in the game when Mike 
Novaria scored after 6:45 into 
the game.
Carnegie Mellon came back to 
tie the game with a Rob Schaef­
fer goal off of an assist from co­
captain Bob Stefanowicz. The 
half ended 1-1.
Off of an assist from Mike 
Ference at the 24:30 mark of the 
second half, Young Kang put the 
ball into the Brandeis net for the 
final and winning point of the 
game.
All-America Candidate Eddie 
Park tops a list of six returning 
lettermen for Carnegie Mellon 
this season. Park, voted team 
MVP as a sophomore last falll, 
led the Tartans with 11 goals 
and six assists and was voted 
first-team All-Region, first-team 
All-PAC for the second straight 
year, and first-team All-UAA.
While Park, a 1988 co-captain, 
highlights the offensive side of 
the ball for Carnegie Mellon, the 
Tartans are not without several 
defensive standouts. Defenders 
Chuck Shvanda and Bob
Stefanowicz, and goalkeeper 
Glen Hoogerwerf, a first team 
All-PAC and honorable mention 
All-UAA selection in 1987, are 
welcome sights for Head Coach 
Nick Gaudioso. Hoogerwerf 
ranked among the league lead­
ers with a 1.17 goals-against- 
average and led the PAC with 
seven shutouts last season.
In last Sunday’s game, Hooger­
werf had 10 saves against the 
Judges.
At the midfield position the 
Tartans return sophomores 
Chris Kasaback and Justin Piz- 
zella. Last year, Pizzella ac­
counted for three goals, two of 
which were game winners, and 
one assist, while Kasabach kept 
pace with a goal and five assists.
The Tartans also return de­
fender Mike Ference, midfielder/ 
defender Joe Schwerha and for­
ward Alan Stein.
The team will play all home 
games at Sewickley Academy.
Ironically, in a pre-season poll, 
the UAA coaches picked Bran­
deis to finish 4th overall and 
Carnegie Mellon 5th.
On the 7th, the team goes to 
play at Slippery Rock Univer­
sity beginning at 4:00 pm.
The next Tartan Soccer home 
game will be against New York 
University on the 11th. Buses 
will leave from Skibo Hall at 
12:15 pm to take fans out to 
Sewickley.

Under first-year head coach 
Julie Babler, the Tartan 
women’s tennis team is currently 
preparing for its upcoming 1988 
season which starts today with 
an away match against 
Duquesne University at 3:30 pm.
Losing two members to gradu­
ation, the Lady Tartans are 
hoping that their experience will 
make the difference this season. 
They hope to recapture the 
President’s Athletic Conference 
championship from Grove City 
College. Returning are Suzy Dot- 
tor, Beth Cavanaugh, Tracy 
Boyd, Alice Garver, Mary Beth 
Ashbaugh, and Sohee Chung.
After posting a 7-1 record last 
season, the women finished a 
close second place behind Grove 
City in the PAC championship. 
Cavanaugh, Amy Fibus, .and 
Boyd captured the numbers two, 
four and five singles titles, re­
spectively, while Dottor and Ca­
vanaugh teamed up to win the 
PAC doubles crown. CMU also 
placed fifth in the First Annual 
University Athletic Association 
Championships, as Boyd and 
Vibus captured the number three 
doubles spot.
“They look really good,” stated 
coach Babler. “They are really 
enthusiastic at practice, and we 
had a good turnout. Fourteen 
people tried out for the team. I 
was really pleased.”
Their first home match will'be 
the 15th, against Indiana Uni­
versity of Pennsylvania.

Sophomore Quarterback Billy Snyder scrambles from Duquesne’s Carl Burdin (72) amd Vinnie Vaccarello during 
the first quarter of Saturday’s season opening game at Mount Lebanon High School.
Patemo. Germany and Schmitt 
will both be back before mid­
season.
The winning touchdown came 
midway through the third quar­
ter. Duquesne’s Marc Vemer 
shanked a punt which set the 
Tartans up at mid-field. On 
second and 12, Snyder found 
Barnyak free to complete a 25 
yard pass. Three plays later the 
sophomore tailback punched the 
ball in from the eight yard line 
for the touchdown. A two point 
conversion put Carnegie Mellon 
on top, 17-7, to stay.
The Tartans added an insur­
ance score early in the fourth 
quarter. Flanker Mike Beresford 
returned another Vemer punt 
to the 50 to put the Tartans in 
business.
The Tartan offense seemed to 
stall in the final quarter, but the 
Dukes helped Carnegie Mellon 
out. On two consecutive plays, 
Duquesne was charged with
personal fouls, taking the Tar­
tans from the Duke 48 to the 13. 
From there, it was up to Bel­
lante and Barnyak to carry the 
ball. Bellante’s one yard dive 
pushed the Tartan lead to 24-7 
with 9:20 remaining.
Duquesne was able to close the 
gap to 24-14 afterwards with its 
own penalty-assisted drive. A 
Carnegie Mellon late hit 
brought the ball to the Tartan 
25, and two plays later the 
Dukes’ big gun, Sean
McDonough carried the ball in 
for the game’s final score.
From the onset, the game 
looked to be all Duquesne. In the 
first play from scrimmage, 
heavyweight Duke fullback 
Robert Grier broke for 26 yards 
to bring his team to the Carne­
gie Mellon 33. However, the drive 
stalled and kicker DougMcAuley 
missed a 42 yard field goal to 
end the scoring threat.
The Tartans were unable to
capitalize, or do much of any­
thing early on in the game. Three 
first quarter drives netted a loss 
of 19 yards and one first down. 
The Dukes could do no better 
until McDonough broke through 
the line for a 55 yard touchdown 
ramble midway through the 
second quarter. That would be 
the last big gain for the Dukes - 
the Tartan defense adjusted and 
as lineman Jason Dowdy noted, 
‘They couldn’t get off the line.”
The Duquesne score seemed to 
be the spark Carnegie Mellon 
needed. Schmitt’s 27 yard kick- 
off return brought the Tartans 
to their 42 yard line where the 
offense took over. Schmitt and 
Hansen took the offensive 
chores, rushing or receiving on
11 of the Tartans’ 13 plays on 
the scoring drive.
Hansen kept the drive alive 
with a two yard carry through 
the left side of the Tartan line on 
fourth down, and was soon fol­
lowed by Schmitt’s 19 yard scam­
per to the 10 yard line. Three 
plays later, Hansen ran the ball 
in and cut the gap to 7-6. ;
Three Duquesne plays anc} a 
punt gave Carnegie Mellon the 
ball with three minutes to go!at 
the Duke 31. The Tartans were 
able to bring the ball as close !as 
the nine before settling for a &4 
yard Jim Kelly field goal to make 
the score 9-7.
This Week: The Tartans 
travel this weekend to St. Louis 
to take on the Washington Uni­
versity Bears. Carnegie Mellon 
soundly defeated the Bears last 
season 35-0 in the final game at 
Tech Field. According to Wash­
ington Head Coach Ken Woody, 
the Bears’ offense is “built 
around big-play people.” How­
ever, their big-play back from 
last year, Don Polacek, gradu­
ated. The game will be broad­
cast on WRCT-FM (88.3) begin­
ning at 7:50 pm Saturday.

King Eider in free rolls last

buggy to beat.
By KARYN SILVA
Tartan Staff Writer
The 1988 Sweepstakes saw a 
first — a two-wheeled buggy 
broke the course record with an 
amazing time of 2:08.5. It came 
as the result of a great deal of 
time, energy, money and overall 
effort on the part of the brothers 
of Delta Upsilon Fraternity. Due 
to a chain of events that proved 
to be unfortunate for DU on the 
second day of racing, Spirit won 
the competition with yet another 
broken course record of 2:06.2.
However, the success of the 
two-wheel buggy sparked the 
concern of the Sweepstakes 
Safety Committee. According to 
Ron Campana of Student Af­
fairs, the committee recognized 
that there was now the poten­
tial for a lot of organizations 
who were looking for a “quick 
good time” to develop two­
wheeled buggies that were not 
at the same high standards as 
those of Delta Upsilon. The situ­
ation was viewed as potentially 
hazardous, since a major acci­
dent or injury could jeopardize
the future of the entire buggy 
program.
A two-wheeled buggy, which is 
defined as any buggy that inten­
tionally has less that three 
wheels touching the ground at 
any time while it is traveling 
around the buggy course, has 
certain inherent problems re­
lating to its stability. With this 
and the possible consequences 
in mind, the Sweepstakes Safety 
Committee met last May and 
made a decision.
The results of this meeting are 
that in the 1988-1989 school year 
no new two-wheel buggies will 
be permitted to participate in 
any Sweepstakes races or prac­
tices. DU will be allowed to race 
with their existing buggies and 
drivers, but will only be allowed 
to race alone during Sweep­
stakes. Between now and May 
of 1989, the Sweepstakes Advi­
sory Committee will try to regu­
late the safety and effects of two- 
wheel buggies. If they cannot be 
adequately regulated, all two- 
wheel buggies will-be banned 
and Delta Upsilon will only be
allowed to race two-wheel bug- c 
gies until their current drivers I 
graduate, provided that theyC 
race alone. t
Campana feels that the ruling c 
was a wise decision and he f 
stands behind the committee and i 
their efforts in trying to develop < 
safe rules for two-wheelers. 3 
Phil Tubesing, the 1988 Sweep­
stakes Safety Co-Chairman, is l 
glad that they didn’t outlaw two-1 
wheel buggies totally. He feels t 
that would be curbing technol- I 
ogy, as it is obvious that these 1 
things roll “wicked fast.” Tu- 1 
besing also agrees that there i 
need to be some sort of safety! 
rules implemented for these 
buggies due to the many things i 
that could happen in the case of i 
an accident. The only part of the < 
ruling that he objects to is that* 1 
two-wheel buggies have to run 1 
alone, which would deprive them < 
of the element of competition, i 
Sweepstakes 1989 will decide 
the fate of two-wheel buggies.’i 
They may become the wave of® 
the future or they may become'i 
obsolete. Only safety can tell.

The Tartan • Camegie Mellon • Wednesday, 7 September 1988Lll-
iUo3lI13lm 7oCmuoras" 7 'lIu oClo u)u3n.Uu alU 8mln
By JOSH RUBEN
Tartan Sports Editor 
So, here you are at Camegie 
Mellon and all you have been 
. dealing with are classes. You 
5 need something to get your mind 
ojit of the books for a while so 
that your brain won’t short cir- 
; cuit. Maybe your beginning to 
feel that “Freshman 15” weigh- 
] ing down on your mid-section, 
j Or, as is most often the case, 
you’re just plain bored.
. .Well don’t fret! As almost any 
I returning student to Camegie 
. Mellon knows, we have one of 
! the best programs any where for 
. beating those “CMU Class Room 
: Brought Down Boredom Blues.”
. It is the Intramural Program,
- affectionately known around 
, these parts as IM (eye-em).
, Due to the East Campus con-
5 struction, most IM fall sports, 
f including football, will be played 
> on Flagstaff Hill. The area will 
I be divided up into three fields 
, with one parallel to the street 
, and the other two above the 
street extending to Porter Hall.
. “The city has been very kind to 
us. We will be allowed to put 
f down chalk lines to mark off the 
; fields,” according to Director of 
Intramural Athletics, Earl J. 
Birdy.
The only drawback to this plan 
is that there will be no night 
games since Flagstaff Hill has 
no lighting facilities. To those 
people who enjoy playing under 
the lights, this may come as 
somewhat of a letdown.
Birdy points out however that, 
“We have three fields now 
whereas before we only had two. 
So scheduling will not be a prob­
lem. Games will be scheduled 
for 4:30,5:30 and 6:30, as long as 
there is sufficient light.” 
According to the construction 
schedule, games should resume 
on the IM fields (currently serv­
ing as a huge parking lot) by this 
time next year.
The IM program is one of the 
few shining jewels in the (often 
tarnished) crown of the Came­
gie Mellon Athletic Department. 
Whether you’re a jock or a brain; 
an athlete or a clutz, you can 
find a sport or game to partici­
pate in and enjoy. The program 
is open to all Camegie Mellon 
students, faculty and staff.
Last year, 9 activities (out of 
the 35 offered) set new Camegie 
Mellon Intramural Records in 
the number of teams competing
in each sport. Also, 13 sports set 
new records in terms of the total 
number of participants compet­
ing. Such sports included Touch 
Football which had 58 teams 
with 746 participants, and Vol­
leyball which had 67 teams ac­
counting for 668 players.
What seems to be the peren­
nial favorite is Basketball, which 
brought out 897 people, playing 
on 99 teams. In addition, the 
program saw an increase in the 
total number of women involved 
with IM sports, including the 
growth of the Women Only sport­
ing leagues.
Even with these numbers, 
Birdy wants to expand the pro­
gram even more. In an effort to 
do this, he will be conducting 
informal talks in the dorms 
around campus. The first one 
will be today at Morrison’s, lo­
cated in Margaret Morrison 
Plaza for the residents of Boss 
Hall, at 7:30 pm.
Mr. Birdy is probably one of 
the most enthusiastic and ener­
getic people on the Camegie 
Mellon staff. He is anxious to 
involve as many people as pos­
sible in the mental and physical 
benefits of participating in the 
IM program.
One of the most gratifying 
features of participating in IM, 
according to Birdy, is “The inter­
action among the students.” He 
adds, “Where else on campus 
can an English or Engineering 
Major get a chance to meet and 
interact with people from the 
Drama Department, for ex­
ample.”
“The fraternities and sorori­
ties are the most consistent or­
ganizations that provide teams 
and players, ” said Birdy. How­
ever, he added that a great deal 
of support has come from inde­
pendent teams (mainly from the 
dorms) in recent years.
Another feature ofthe program 
is that it is run by students from 
all parts of the campus commu­
nity. According to Birdy, “The 
Intramural Board was made up 
mainly of Greeks, but now it is 
mostly independents.”
Every week, the current team 
standings, upcoming events, and 
general IM news will be printed

By NATALIE HAWRYLUK
Assistant Sports Editor 
After advancing to the semi­
finals at the inaugural Univer­
sity Athletic Association Cham­
pionships and finishing fourth 
in the President’s Athletic Con­
ference last season, Head Coach 
Sue Flaherty is optimistic about 
the Lady Tartans’ 1988 season.
“We’ll be playing a lot of de­
fense,” says Flaherty, “as well 
as concentrating on good pass­
ing and serving. We’re working 
on being smart hitters rather 
than powerful hitters.”
The Lady Tartans will be play­
ing primarily a 5 -1 offense with 
junior Laurie Shumaker setting. 
Shumaker, the team’s second- 
leading setter last year behind 
Marianne Smith, recorded 36 
assists and 97 kills during the 
CMU’s campaign in 1987.
“Laurie [Shumaker] doesn’t 
have that much experience in 
the middle, but she is working 
hard,” commented Flaherty.
Five letterwinners return to 
the squad this season led by 
middle hitter/blocker Nicole 
Hanak, a second-team All-PAC 
selection last fall.
Hanak, a starting freshman, 
finished the 1987. season as 
CMU’s team leader with 112 
total blocks - 45 unassisted - and 
174 kills. She ranked fifth in the 
PAC with 1.32 blocks per game, 
and eighth in the league with
2.05 spiking aces per contest. 
Joining at the middle-hitter/ 
blocker position will be Diane 
Watson, a three-year letterwin- 
ner, who was third on the team 
with 104 kills and 83 blocks in 
‘87. The Lady Tartans will rely 
heavily upon Watson’s experi­
ence and leadership this season 
said Flaherty.
Other returnees include junior 
Kris Loh and sophomore Cindy 
Peperak.
New comers for CMU include; 
junior Lynn Truskie, sophomore^ 
Paula Madden and freshmen 
Colleen Duckett and Deborah 
Perry.
“This year, we’re further along 
at this point than we were at the 
same point last year,” said 
Flaherty. She attributed this to 
a pre-season conditioning camp 
for returning players.
The Lady Tartans begin their 
1988 campaign tomorrow night 
at 7:00 pm against Pitt- 
Johnstown and Carlow at Skibo; 
Gym. The annual Carnegie; 
Mellon volleyball tournament; 
will be this weekend, Septeni* 
ber 9th and 10th.

A single exam score may be more 
important than your hard »earned 
GPA.
Thousands of 
bright, otherwise 
eligible students 
are unfairly penal­
ized every year for 
being underprepared, 
for not knowing criti­
cal test-taking skills or 
for freezing up during the 
actual exam, thus concealing 
their true “aptitude.” You can 
overcome these problems if you 
know what kind of questions to 
expect, have learned proven 
test-taking strategies, and have 
practiced under simulated test 
conditions.
GAPS gives you the knowledge, 
confidence and the competitive edge 
you need to succeed on critical exams.3
