VOL. II, No. 27 PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 1908. TEN CENTS.
BASE BALL OUTLOOK
Now that the basketball season is over, we look 
forward to the prospects for a championship baseball 
as well as a track team. Since the various day 
classes voted in favor of starting school a half hour 
earlier, and cutting the dinner hour from an hour 
to a half hour, the manager of the baseball team has 
been hard at work scheduling mid-week games. Gw- 
ing to our grounds not being in good order, no home 
games will be played during the month of April. 
But after the first of May, only three games will be 
played on foreign fields during the remainder of the 
school year.
To make the season a successful one, we must 
have the support of the student body. It is the in­
tention of the baseball manager to give the students 
a series of ten or twelve games at home for the sum 
of two dollars. Tickets will be placed on sale in the 
store-room on Tuesday, April 7, and can be obtained 
from the manager, assistant manager, and captain 
of the team. Season tickets will be on sale through­
out the month of April, and no season ticket will be 
sold after the first game for less than two dollars.
During the past week the players have had some 
good practice, due to the warm weather.
Mr. Wolf, a former University of Pennsylvania 
player, who turned out a good team last year, has 
been chosen to coach the baseball candidates once 
more. He will be ably assisted by Ad. Gumbert, a 
former National League pitcher, who will coach the 
candidates for the position of pitcher.
Capt. Halferty is anxious that all candidates 
report for practice each evening at 4 r ’clock, or as 
early as possible. In view of the hard schedule, it 
will necessitate a strong combination of good players 
to successfully cope with the various school teams, 
with which games have been scheduled.
Mr. Wolf and Capt. Halferty have a difficult 
task before them m selecting a strong team with only 
one week’s practice. Many strong candidates have 
reported for practice, but we can not judge a player 
so early in the season.
One position that will be hard to fill is that of 
pitcher. Wills, who did the slab duty for the team 
last year, and was really the back-bone of the team, 
is not a candidate for the team, not being in school. 
Of the new cadidates we can not truly judge until 
they have participated in a championship game. 
Among the most promising cadidates for pitcher are 
Bragg, Disohner, Burnside and George. Any man 
from the night school who can find it convenient 
to come out for practice, should do so and give the 
captain and coach the opportunity to pick the strong­
est team available.
The following schedule will show that many 
strong teams are scheduled for games at home.
The boys will leave for Morgantown at 7 o’clock 
Saturday morning to play their first game. The 
team hopes to make a favorable impression.

4 —-------- THE TARTAN
§ NINETEEN TWELVE |
J. Le Roy Hoffman, Editor.
The regular monthly class meeting will be held 
Friday evening at the usual time and place. Every­
body out! Make this meeting beat the last one. 
Three or four matters of importance will be pre­
sented and discussed. Ask .President Helm regard­
ing them and be ready to give your opinion when 
called upon to do so, as quickly and as tersely as 
possible. Much time is sometimes lost in our class 
meetings by fellows who have something to say 
but generally take about five minutes to say “I think 
so,” or, “I want to kick,” or their equivalent. Every 
member of the class is pressed for his opinion and 
every member of the class has a night to give his 
opinion on any subject under consideration at a 
class meeting, and we hope no one will take, excep­
tion to the above remarks and stay away from the 
meeting, but the point is, if you want to “kick,” 
do so quickly.
1912 sees nothing commendable in the action of
1910 the evening of our visit to the girl’s school. 
From our point of view their action was nothing 
more nor less than a piece of “snobbery,” pure and 
simple. But 1912 does not feel a bit offended nor 
do they hold the least bit of a grudge against their 
brethren of ’10 as a result of the affair. ’12 realizes 
that there are occasions when their presence would 
be objectionable to ’10—it does not necessarily fol­
low that ’10 is in any way superior to ’12—hence, 
we did not get offended when greeted at the door 
with the expression, “1910 only.” The gentlemen 
of 1912, or rather, the class* of 1912 (they are all 
gentlemen) are not “butters-in,” and always make 
their exit when they realize they are not wanted. 
Of course 1910 realizes that there are occasions 
when their presence would be exceedingly objec­
tionable to their brethren of ’12 (we have no reason 
for believing they are of a different opinion), and, of 
course, being the gentlemen they appear to be, 
they would not treat the “kindergarten” with the 
same consideration that the “kindergarten” treated 
the “grandfathers” with on the evening of tihe above 
affair.
On behalf of the class, Rees Griffith has pre­
sented a Tech pennant to R. J. Swinbank, and will 
give one to Mr. Fuhs as soon as the Apprentices 
and Journeymen’s pennants are procurable at the 
store-room.
Baseball! Baseball! Baseball! Get busy, 
McCowen! Do something!
The banquet will be held in the near future; 
probably during the Easter vacation.
Section B has taken exceptions to an item which
appeared in these columns last week, while D------
well, D is keeping “mum.” The item ir question is 
the one referring to D being ahead in Mathematics. 
B claims they are champion Algebra and Trig swal­
lowers and the facts of the case seem to bear them
out in their contention. All right, B, please accept
my most humble apologies. Dig, A, G and D.
“The bone of contention” and the root of all 
evil (bad feeling)—woman. If you doubt it, just read 
the articles of A. F. S. and J. H. T. in the last two is­
sues of the Tartan.i V* v l' V •
‘ He kissed her on her ruby lips;
She nearly had a fit.
You see, it was her husband 
And she wasn’t used to it.”
“Yes, I know, but seeing is believing,” remarked 
Skeehan, as he walked over the bridge Monday 
evening.
“Not necessarily,” replied Crosby. “Take your­
self, for instance. Now, I see you quite often—in 
fact, every day—but as to believing you, why------.”
Crosby is still running.
At a canvas of the class made last week, twenty- 
two members of Section B pledged themselves to a 
banquet. Now, it is up to the other sections to make 
it twenty-four each. Whatever you do A, C, or D, 
don’t stop at the twenty-three mark!
Everyone is pleased with the picture of the class, 
which was recently taken for the Thistle, except 
those (some of them) who were noton it. Extremely 
sorry (?) we can’t have it taken again just for your 
sakes, fellows.

1912 BANQUET.
Plans and general information of our First An­
nual Banquet will be announced by the Social Com­
mittee at the regular class meeting Friday evening, 
April 3d. The class is to decide where the Banquet 
shall be held, who the speakers and guests are to be, 
and other details. As there is much business of 
general interest to be transacted at this meeting, 
the President requests all members to be IN the As­
sembly Room by 10.35 P. M., Friday evening, this 
week.

Raymond J. Rodgers, Editor.
The appearance of Mr. Weber’s name in connec­
tion with the note regarding King’s engagement in 
last week’s Tartan was the result of mischievous re­
arranging of the editor’s manuscripts by some out­
side and unknown party. Nevertheless we wish to 
offer an apology to 'Mr. Weber for this unintentional 
disrespect.
Thomas Pringle has ?ccepted a responsible po­
sition with a well-known architectural firm in 
Youngstown, Ohio, and leaves soon to take charge 
of their large office. Any concern is exceedingly for­
tunate in securing so able a man. But it is with 
deep regret we will see Tom leave us. He was the 
first massier elected by this school and has labored 
faithfully always. We hope the change will be for 
Tom’s advancement and extend to him our hearty 
good wishes for the future.
At last King finished that Sienna Pulpit drawing.
More men took the Class A Esquiesse on .Satur­
day than at any previous time in the history of this 
school. The final report on the last class B problems 
shows that Carnegie Tech is still holding up her re­
markable average. Out of 42 drawings submitted
36 received mention. The report on Class A has 
not yet been received.
On next Tuesdey, April 7, there will be held a 
second shindig. This will be given jointly with the 
Day men and the committee is working hard to 
make this the liveliest affair of the year.
We regret to hear Cocken leaves for Youngs­
town to accept a position there. (Summer would like 
to see you to put you wise, Cocken.) Also Louis 
Stevens goes to Canton with a well-known firm of 
that town. The class loses two popular men in 
these boys, but we wish them all kinds of success.
Mr. Campbell submitted a dandy design for the 
Cope Memorial prize competition and should surely

THE TARTAN
NINETEEN ELEVEN
k , A. F. Stamm, Editor.
The girls of the M. M. C. S. are indignant over 
a statement made by 1910 in the last issue of the 
Tartan. The remark in question reads as follows: 
“Some of the girls said, ‘One don’t feel at home 
with the second year men.’ ”
Their indignation, supplemented by the righteous 
wrath of their English teachers, should prove a val­
uable lesson to 1910, and it is to be hoped that when 
they attempt a quotation they will couch it in the ex­
act words of the speaker and not in the crude dialect 
to which they are accustomed.
1911’s modesty forbids her making any inquiry 
into the truth of the statement, but at flx*st glance 
the whole incident looms up as a transparent case 
of flattery (in 20th century lingo “jollying”) which 
the gullible recipients accepted as truth.
It is too bad that polite journalism forbids pro­
fanity; then 1910 might have given a little stronger 
tirade against the person who so very innocently 
incurred their displeasure. As it was, the intended 
sarcasm, which formed the vertabral portion of their 
effusions was lamentably weak in several places 
and quite incoherent in others.
By way of remark, the editor would like to 
state that the 1911 banquet mentioned in the 1910 
column last week escaped the notice of the Tartan, 
but where those who have not had one banquet have 
any right to criticize those who have held two, is 
quite beyond the comprehension of the latter.
? ? * ?
Gloetzner, of B-2, has been compelled to leave 
school for the season, as he aptly puts it, “I can’t 
live here and board in heaven.”
* * * *
It is a good thing that there are no more basket­
ball games on Friday evenings. The great loyalty 
of the night students forbids their studying even 
if they can’t attend the games.
A 1911 gallant was seen going home last Sunday 
evening at 10 o’clock. On being asked why he was 
headed in that direction at that early hour he said, 
“O, I was to meet ‘her’ after church at 8.45 P. M., 
and as the service was still in full blast at 9.30 I 
thought it time to move, or be arrested as a suspic­
ious character.”
* * * *
The violent antipathy of the rival editors of 
1910 and ’11 as shown by their respective columns 
in the Tartan, is quite at variance with their “Damon 
and Pythias” attitude when they meet in the cor­
ridors.

One of the men who is continually saying, “She 
said this,” or, “She said or did that,” was asked, 
“Well, who is SHE?” “Well, you know, fellows, 
there is only SHE for me, and that is HER,” he 
emphatically declared.* * * *
On Wednesday evening, April 8th, the regular 
meeting of the class of 1911 will be held in the As­
sembly Room. A good attendance is desired at th'~ 
meeting as it will be the last regular meeting of the 
school year of 1907-8.
There are several matters of vital importance 
to be taken up and there is a final report of the ban­
quet to be read. The class will no doubt be eager 
to learn what became of the funds raised and how 
the deficit incurred at the banquet was met.
The executive staff have shown the class all 
possible consideration and have passed several reg­
ular meetings rather than make the demand on the 
time of the men. But they urge as a personal favor 
a large turnout on the last meeting. The parliamen­
tary rigidity with which the meetings have been 
conducted heretofore, will be relaxed to such an ex­
tent that smoking will not only be permitted, but 
furnished. It will be a little informal smoker in­
volving no fees of any kind and will serve to 
strengthen the ties which bind those who have stood 
the rigors of two years of good hard work, and who 
will be proud under the blue and white of 1911 next 
year.
Don’t forget, bring your pipe and the social 
committee will bring the “makins” and stogies.
There will be no entertainment except the trans­
action of business and a discussion in a fitting man­
ner in which to close the school year. Shall it be a 
dance, or a private roller skating party, a natatorium 
party, theatre party or what? Your opinion is not 
only asked, but earnestly solicited.

A large attendance at the basket-ball game Fri­
day night, caused a small attendance in classes 
starting at 8:30. 1910 was among those present at
the game, and helped materially in the cheering.

McHose was a little late in leaving home for

course.* * * *

Thé actions of the Day' Juniors in regard to the 
publishing of the year book, has placed 1910 in a 
peculiar position. We agreed to co-operate with 
them, first, when they decided to make the publi­
cation a purely School of Applied Science and De­
sign one, and afterward when they decided, upon the 
suggestions of the Director, to make it an all-schools 
book; now we are told they have abandoned the 
work entirely.
1910 is heartily in favor of publishing the This­
tle, and, thinking it the best policy to act in har­
mony with the class having charge of the work, 
went ahead and even voted for what we thought 
was the sentiment of the Day Juniors.
Since the Juniors have given up the idea of 
publishing a book and 1910 has agreed to co-operate 
with them, places us in the position of favoring an 
all-schools year book, and at the same ime agreeing 
not to publish one.

Last Friday afternoon the members of the relay

the first of the elimination trials to determine the 
relay team which will go to Philadelphia on April 
25th. The heats were started at about 5 o’clock, 
and were run off in about ten minutes. Both Coach 
Thompson and Captain Dowling expressed them­
selves as highly pleased, both regarding the time 
and the large turnout of candidates. The track was 
rather rough, due to the rain and snow of the past 
winter, so fast time could not be expected.
The results were as follows:
1st heat—Dowling, Agnew, Koethen, McTighe.
2d heat—Charles, Hatcher, Wylie, Gray, McIn­

3d heat—Frampton, Slocum, Young, Rinehart,

period when the graduates of all prep schools are 
looking around for a place to continue their educa­

home town all about Carnegie Tech, point out the 
advantages of a technical education, set the pros­
pective student on the right track regarding the 
many newspaper accounts of the doings here, and 
you will have done a favor to your alma mater and

THE SPIRIT OF VANDALISM.
There seems, at present, to0 be * a lamentable 
spirit of vandalism abroad. This applies more par­
ticularly to the students of the day schools, though 
in a lesser degree, it is true of the night schools also. 
This spirit is reprehensible whether it takes the 
form oi target‘practice with modeling clay or parad­
ing under banners of the brand of paper affected 
by one of our schools on a recent occasion. While 
this spirit might result in good if kept up until the 
majority should be forced to put an end to it by eli­
minating the men to blame; it is to be hoped that 
the guilty parties will come to their senses before 
such action becomes necessary.
The whole matter hinges on whether the student 
body is willing to assume control of its own govern­
ment or not. At present, although according to 
catalogue announcement, the student body is self- 
governing, with Faculty advice, there is practic­
ally no semblance of discipline outside of class 
rooms. This state of affairs might be and probably 
is entirely satisfactory to the night schools where 
their time is so limited. It will have to come to 
an end at no distant time for the day schools, how­
ever. This fact is recognized by the Faculty and 
by some of the students, the fact that it was recog­
nized having resulted in a series of resolutions 
adopted and presented to the Applied Science stu­
dents. The Senior class adopted them after lengthy 
and acrimonious discussion, while the Junior class 
seemed to feel that if its provisions were not glit­
tering they could at least be called generalities and 
so referred them back to the committee without 
action, if any was taken, by the remaining class of 
Applied Science and by the other schools we are 
unable to state. Their action, if affirmative, would 
be to a large degree negative if all the classes who 
would be subject to its terms and upon whom would 
fall a portion of the burden of its enforcement, did 
not subscribe.
It behooves us then to check the vandals among 
us lest by their action we be forced into some system 
of government which would be onerous later on, 
although it might seem a necessity now. We are 
hopeful that these few words of warning will be suf­
ficient to stop baseball practice with light globes 
and the moving of entire blocks of lockers from their 
proper positions.

12THE TARTAN
PLEBES
The Mock Trial held on Wednesday evening
not only created interest here at Tech, but excited
our yellow-paged rivals downtown. One would have it 
that the school is a robbers’ den where it is neces­
sary to keep the handcuffs ever handy, and be able 
to form a police court at a moment’s notice. Not 
only were the news sheets of our own city agitated, 
but several New York ones had it all on the front 
page, 'me event, itself, however, deserved prominent 
mention. Beginning rather late it kept the hundred 
or so spectators interested to the finish.
Judge Martin handed his decisions around in a 
free and lavish way. It was with difficulty that a 
jury was secured, Scotty Henderson being one of 
the most difficult to persuade to serve.
The opening lawyers for prosecution and de­
fense, Poste and McIntyre, made noble efforts. The 
witnesses created excitement and it frequently be­
came necessary to call for order. Miss Gugenheimer 
(Snider) and Gibson, impersonating the young lady 
in the case, made the hits of the evening. The pris­
oner, Wasson, sat through the trial with a dejected 
attitude, handcuffed and guarded. After having been 
declared innocent, it came time to get the handcuffs 
off. While attempting to do this, the key was broken 
off short in the lock. The chain was removed in the 
machine shop, and the Oakland Police Station vis­
ited in hope of their being more versed in the work­
ings of such things than any of the memebrs of the 
party. Nothing doing.' Wasson went to bed with 
his wrist encircled by the steel band. Next morning 
a locksmith made a key and was able to remove 
it without any difficulty.? ? ? ?
It is with the deepest regret we announce that 
Mr. H. C. Wilson, better known as “St. Peter,” has 
left Tech. He intends taking the Forestry course 
next year at Purdue.

THE TARTANiâ
COMMERCIAL SLANG.
The following choice bit of American slang was 
culled from the advertising literature of the Dodge 
Co.:
The Finish of Plain Greasy Hanger or the Victim of 
Progress.
“Ease up, there, you long, lean lobster,” squealed 
old Plain Greasy Hanger to Turned Steel Shaft. “I 
haven't had my morning grog yet, and I’m as dry 
and hot as a Sahara sirocco.”
“Can’t do it, old man,” answered the shaft. “Old 
Receiving Pulley here has an awful hump on himself 
this morning; he’s turning me so fast I can’t see my 
coupling bolts, and he’s pulling the everlasting bend­
ing moments out of me. Say, Pulley, what makes 
you so strenuous to-day?”
“Aw, shut up, or I’ll slip a set screw on you. I 
have got troubles of my own,” growled the Pulley. 
“I heard the boss say yesterday that he was going 
to speed you up to increase the output, and last 
night they put up a new shaft across the way, with 
the slickest and most stylish hangers that ever came 
into this mill, and then mounted a big, wooden-faced 
fellow opposite me. My Crown! but that fellow has 
an awful delivery. I can hardly hold him, and he 
glares at me like ¡a Malay pirate if I let the belt slip 
a little.”
“Oh! Great Oil Trust,” groaned poor old Hanger; 
“I can’t stand this much longer.”
“'Say! what’s the matter with you all over here?” 
roared Double Leather Belt. “Independence Pulley 
on the other line says you are all a bunch of cheap 
skates, and that if you don’t quit your squealing and 
monkeying he will pull you all up by the roots.”
“Hello! is that you, Greasy?” rattled the Belt; 
“what’s eating you? No booze to-day, eh? You 
poor, helpless old slob. If you don’t get your daily 
dope you’re out of business. You always were a 
warm member, Greasy,” laughed the Belt, “but you’re 
a ‘has-been’ and you can’t travel in keen modern so­
ciety.
“Oh! Suffering Babbit,” gasped old Hanger 
again; “if I only had a high ball of Rockefeller xxx 
rye I might pull through.”
“Say, that new Capillary family on the other 
side have you all looking like tallow dips on an 
Electric Tower,” continued the Belt, who was a na­
tive of Texas; ‘‘.those Capillary brothers are certainly 
the smoothest that ever came down the pike. You 
ought to see them do your trick, Greasy. They do 
a “six months’ turn without the squirt of an oil can. 
How? By carrying their supplies right along with 
them. That’s how. Tanks full in the cellar, with 
syphon connections to every floor; one continuous 
Jag of joy without the headache or the torrid tank 
of to-morrow. !My Lacing, those boys are sincere 
and consistent drinkers.”
“Oh, chop it out, Cow Belly,” wheezed poor old 
Hanger; “I’m up against it, I know, and I can see 
my finish, so don’t rub it in. I’m almost gone—Oh! 
there goes my babbit. Good-bye, boys.”

BASKETBALL SEASON CLOSES.
On Friday evening the much-heralded basket­
ball game between Tech and Wup was fought out 
before the largest and noisest croWd of the season. 
The Wup team seems .to have gathered considerable 
strength since their last game and Bunny Eliott 
does not do such a great part 01 the playing. The 
game was as rough a contest ¡as we have seen and 
all the fouls were not called, either..Leety made a 
hit during the first half, by his throwing foul goals, 
but was not able to do as well when trying for the 
other basket in the second half. Bruce Lytle put up 
his usual consistent game and Buhl was generally 
there when needed. Captain Neudorfer was badly 
hampered by his shoulder which was still weak from 
the effects of dislocation suffered in the last Wup 
game. Johnson was substituted in the second half 
for Leety at the earnest request of the referee. 
The game was preceeded by a preliminary between 
the Wup freshmen and the Junior Electricals which 
was rather amusing to the spectators. Although 
our basketball team has not won every game this 
season, they have made some teams sit up and take 
notice, notably the great W. U. P. aggregation. 
Manager Steen deserves the ' thanks of the school 
for his intelligent labor in behalf of the team.

Love is a dolorific laceration of the cardiac sub­
organization induced by the proximity of the person 
affected, diversified by unparalleled coagmentation of 
heteronenious hallucination, and not uncommonly 
co-existant with a deterioration of the predilection 
for materialistic sustenance; and an aggrandizement 
of the impermance of torpescent or lethargic relax­
ation.—Ex.
The largest number of crew candidates in the 
history of rowing at Yale have gone into the spring 
practice this year. Twelve crews are out every day 
on the Quinnipiac river, under Coach Kennedy. Of 
these, five crews are candidates for the ’Varsity 
eight and four, the remainder being candidates for 
the freshman boat and class crews.

posed the team. Hussey is a Denver boy.

THE TARTAN15
In Dartmouth’s foot-ball schedule for this year 
just issued, the teams to be played are the same as 
last year, except that games with Princeton and Wil­
liams are again on the schedule. This necessitated 
the dropping of two smaller games from the schedule 
—the University -of Norwich and New Hampshire 
State.
Action designed for the prevention of what is 
known as the “summer base-ball evil” at Cornell, 
has been taken by the faculty of that institution. 
The rule as passed declares that a man who plays 
under an assumed name—for which there can be no 
justification—or who plays in a game at which an 
admission fee is charged, except as a member or 
representative of a school of college team, is conclu­
sively presumed to have violated the rule which de­
bars a man from athletics on the ground of receiv­
ing compensation.
Thfe faculty of Lehigh has recommended to the 
athletic committee that the number of games for 
each season in each department of athletics be lim­
ited as follows: Foot-ball, 8; basket-ball, 8; lacrosse, 
G; base-ball, 12; track, 4.
Cornell upper classmen have recently adopted 
a regulation which forbids freshmen to sit in a trol­
ley car when by so doing an upper classman would 
be obliged to stand.
An eligibility rule for members of athletic 
teams has at last been passed by the authorities of 
Carlisle. In future no professionals or four-year 
men will be allowed to play and this will put them 
on a better standing among the colleges than for­
merly because no restrictions of any kind have been 
placed on candidates for the teams of that institu­
tion.—Ex.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cor­
nell are rivals for the distinction of having the first 
formal course of electrical engineering in this coun­
try; both colleges graduated their first electrical en­
gineers in 1885.-
Harvard University is planning to extend its re­
lations with foreign universities whereby students 
may be exchanged without expense to either party to 
the agreement.
. The “Yale Alumni Weekly” calls attention to 
the recent tendency of appointing to the faculty a 
¡larger proportion of graduates of other colleges. 
The aim is to guard against too much “inbreeding!”
Seventy-three Princeton students have been 
dropped since the mid-year examinations. There is 
an increased number of failures in the Sophomore 
class of the A. B. department.
