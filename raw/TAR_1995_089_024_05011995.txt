he theme of Pioneers’ booth this year was “Ghostbusters." They 
*ere recently given third place in the Independent category.

In what has been described as 
an “oversight,” some trophies 
weren’t awarded to the appropri­
ate organizations at the Awards 
Ceremony during this year’s 
Spring Carnival.
Pioneers was awarded third 
place in the Independent Booth 
category, while Spirit once again 
earned first in the environmen­
tal category.
When the trophies were or­
dered, they could not find any 
written documentation on how 
many trophies are traditionally 
given out. “We never ordered 
three independent category tro­
phies,” said Rebecca Albrecht, the 
Midway chair, “we only ordered 
two.”
The committee could not find 
any evidence that showed that 
this was wrong. “No one ever re­
alized it until the day of the 
awards ceremony,” said Albrecht. 
Anne Witchner, the assistant 
dean of Student Affairs, pointed 
out that there were usually three
trophies. At the ceremony, Fringe 
was awarded first place for their 
“Roadrunner and Coyote” booth 
and the Asian Student Associa­
tion took second for their “Winnie 
the Pooh” booth.
Pioneers was named third later 
for their “Ghostbusters” booth.
in the Environmental Category. 
This is the category that is judged 
by the type of materials used and 
the “recyclability” of the booth. 
This is open to all of the booths, 
independent or Greek. At the 
awards ceremony, Sigma Nu was 
awarded first prize with their
“We were very willing to get a trophy 
for them [Pioneers] and make an 
announcement about it. ”
— Rebecca Albrecht, 
Midway Chair
“We didn’t want to announce it at 
the awards ceremony because we 
didn’t want to make that deci­
sion,” said Albrecht. “We were 
very willing to get a trophy for 
them and make an announcement 
about it.”
Members of Pioneers were un­
available for comment.
There was also some alteration
“Little Mermaid” booth. “Spirit 
[scored higher] than SigNu,” said 
Albrecht.
“On Saturday, Spirit was dis­
qualified for missing Midway 
watches,” she added.
Albrecht said there were ways 
to overturn a disqualification. 
“We gave every organization the 
opportunity to make up these
watches. [Spirit] was able to make 
up for their fines and disqualifi­
cation by showing up for extra 
clean-up on Saturday.
“We don’t have a clause any 
where that says once you’re dis­
qualified, you’re disqualified [for 
good],” said Albrecht.
Spirit will also receive a first 
place trophy in the Environmen­
tal Category.
The question is, what about Sig 
Nu?
“Sig Nu will keep their trophy,” 
Albrecht said, “Logistically I don’t 
know if we’re just going to name 
them [both] first place winners or 
what.” She added that both orga­
nizations had high scores.
Members of Spirit were un­
available for comment. Sig Nu 
could not be reached.
Albrecht praised both booths 
for being environmentally con­
scious. “Spirit really did a nice 
job.
“They used a lot of stuff before 
and were planning on re-using a 
lot of stuff,” she said. “Sigma Nu 
uses the same booth every year, 
so they also won.”

The Student Dormitory Council’s 
(SDC) proposed smoking policy was a 
hot topic at Wednesday night’s SDC
meeting, which included ----------------------
John Hannon, coordina­
tor for Residence Life, 
four smokers, several 
other observers, and 
SDC members in atten­
dance. After much delib­
eration on proposed 
changes, the policy was 
voted down.
The vote gave one in 
approval, six opposed, 
andnine abstentions, to- “ZZZZIZII^ 
taling 16 voters, al­
though there are 27 petitioned members 
in SDC.
Austin Shifrin, president of SDC, com­
mented on this lack of attendance, “While 
I’ll admit that this is not a large number
of people to be voting on such an issue, 
other people... are aware of how difficult 
it is to encourage participation. We are 
nearing finals.”
Beginning the debate on the smoking 
policy was Hannon, representing both

put together because we can change 
it, not because there was a great need 
for it.”
— Paul Krier, 
junior computer science major
Tim Foster, director of Residence Life, 
and Dave Potter, director of Housing, 
since neither could attend the meeting. 
Hannon said, “[I am 99 percent certain] 
that both Residence Life and Housing
deemed the policy unfeasible since stu­
dents had already signed their housing 
contracts. [My] recommendation would 
be to hold off.” Hannon’s remarks per­
tained to section IV.A of the proposed 
smoking policy which states, “This policy 
----------------------- will take affect on Au­
gust 1, 1995, unless 
deemed to be unfeasible 
by the Director of Hous­
ing.”
After further debate, 
Hannon made it clear 
that each person want­
ing to back out of his or 
her housing contract be­
cause of this policy, if 
implemented, would 
have to be considered.
The current smoking 
policy includes a fine of $25-$50 for

does not include as broad of an enforce­
ment or as tough of a Penalties section

Art installation set up 
in memory of Holocaust
By SUDHIR REDDY
Tartan Staffwriter
. On Tuesday, April 25, an art instal­
lation commemorating the Holocaust 
was set up off the walkway by the Cut. 
The installation, constructed by Ethan 
Yungerman, a freshman architecture 
student, and Jeremy Posner, a sopho­
more in production design, was among 
several events of the week which re­
membered Yom HaShoah, the Hebrew 
iterm for the “Day of the Holocaust.” 
i The installation presented faceless 
people wearing garments behind a 
barbed wire fence.
Yungerman said that the faceless 
people did not solely represent the 
Jews who perished in the Holocaust. 
“[The art installation] gives an obvi­
ous representation of someone behind 
the fence. It doesn’t have to be a Jew.
It could have been anyone in particu­
lar.” Initially Yungerman wanted to 
use the walkway between Hunt Li­
brary and the College of Fine Arts 
building as the location of the art in­
stallation, but he said that the idea 
was not feasible. “We couldn’t get per­
mission because the lawn was being 
re-sodded and there was electric wire 
running underneath it.”
However, Yungerman had two pri­
mary locations in mind and was able 
to get permission to use the walkway 
by the Cut.
Yungerman felt that the second lo­
cation was indeed better because there 
was more student traffic so more stu­
dents could see the exhibit.
The installation was funded by 
Hillel, the Jewish University Center 
located in Oakland. SHOAH (Students

On April 27, the Ms. Foundation spon­
sored Take Our Daughters to Work day, 
a national event which gives girls ages 
nine to 14 an opportunity to learn about 
the job world and other topics including 
education. Carnegie Mellon embraced 
the program for the second year in a row, 
hosting over 75 daughters from the fac­
ulty and staff. The program was a huge 
success compared to last year’s which 
only involved nine girls.
Carnegie Mellon’s program has been 
in the works since before this semester 
began. This year they broke down into 
three major sections: morning, in which 
the girls accompanied their hosts in their 
work places; a luncheon, in which Presi­
dent Robert Mehrabian and the former 
Mayor of Pittsburgh, Sophie Masloff, 
spoke; and an afternoon of various lec­
tures, demonstrations and talks.
The morning track included Fitness in 
the Gym with Donna Morosky, director 
of Fitness and Health. Morosky informed 
the girls about the importance of main­
taining a healthy body. Also in the morn­
ing, Liz Winter, head Crew coach, told 
girls how she went from being a corpo­
rate lawyer in London to being a coach in 
Pittsburgh.
Sarah Gabouer, a participant in the 
program, said that “it is really fun to see 
what college is like ... it is really differ­

ent than I thought it was like.” Ed 
Gabouer, from the Software Engineer­
ing institute, planned to make a day of 
it, “We will probably spend a little time 
at the Carnegie [Museum], and maybe 
walk around Pittsburgh a little bit.” 
Though Gabouer signed up too late for 
his daughter to be included in one of the 
tracks, he still planned for his daughter 
to have a full day.
At lunch, Melissa Cicozi, assistant 
department head for Design, introduced
President Mehrabian. Cicozi played a 
major role in the planning of the pro­
gram.
Mehrabian’s speech attempted to in­
spire girls to be the best they can be. He 
guaranteed, “If you do well in school, 
and you study, and you pay attention to 
your parents and your teachers, you can 
go to any school that you want in the 
world. If you want to come here, you can 
come here. All you need to do is be a good

Videotape may lead to unknown suspect
OKLAHOMA CITY, Okla., April 28 
—In a videotape taken just before the 
bombing in Oklahoma City, Timothy 
McVeigh’s missing Arizona license 
plate appears on the vehicle in a video­
tape. Authorities think that the ve­
hicle may have been driven by “John 
Doe 2” for his getaway.
TheFBIissearchingforlicenseplate 
number: LZC646. It was found on 
McVeigh’s yellow 1977 Mercury Mar­
quis about five days before the bomb­
ing. When McVeigh was stopped by a 
state trooper 75 minutes after the blast, 
the license plate was gone.
In the videotape the Ryder truck is 
pictured with another car. The car had 
the missing license plate. The Ryder 
truck is believed to have held the 4,800- 
pound bomb.
Investigators believe that this sec­
ond vehicle was the getaway car. It 
has yet to be recovered and might be in 
the possession of the third party not 
yet arrested.
A sketch of the third suspect may be 
released in a few days.
DuringMcVeigh’s preliminary hear­
ing on Thursday, John Hersley, an 
FBI agent, said that the agency was 
rushing to find the third suspect for 
fear he would strike again.
He went on to say that a witness saw 
McVeigh and another suspect speed 
out of the parking lot of the Alfred P. 
Murrah Federal Building just prior to 
the explosion.
McVeigh, 27, is the only person that 
has been charged so far for the April 
19 bombing. He is being held without 
bail until more evidence is recovered.
The death toll in the worst act of 
terrorism in U.S. history rose to 118 
Friday, including 15 children.
The search in the building was de­
layed after a slab of concrete fell and 
slid into the Social Security office and
day care center. The workers then 
worked to install orange nets around 
the edges of the open floors to prevent 
any debris from falling on a search 
team.
The bombing took place on the two- 
year anniversary of the fire that de­
stroyed the Branch Davidian com­
pound in Waco, Texas. McVeigh has 
been know to hold extreme right-wing 
views. An affidavit says he was upset 
by the conduct of the FBI in the Waco 
disaster.
About seven citizens from Waco vis­
ited the demolished federal building 
Friday morning. They brought three 
flower-covered crosses and claimed 
they now shared a common bond with 
Oklahoma City.
A hotel manager in Kingman, Ari­
zona, said that McVeigh stayed at his 
hotel from March 31 to April 12.
He was by himself and received no 
phone calls. The hotel was the Impe­
rial Hotel.
The manager said that a witness 
saw McVeigh in Oklahoma City on 
April 13.
The next day McVeigh checked into 
a Junction City, Kansas, hotel from 
where the - government believes he 
rented the truck.
Other leads included a crumbled 
business card from a military supply 
store in Antigo, Wisconsin. The card 
was found in the police car that took 
McVeigh to jail.
Investigators questioned the own­
ers of the store to determine whether 
or not they provided McVeigh with 
small explosive devices necessary for 
setting off the Oklahoma City explo­
sion.
Sources say that McVeigh had been 
in phone contact with the owners, Ed 
and Linda Paulsen, as early as nine 
months before the explosion.
President introduces anti-terrorism proposal
WASHINGTON, April 28 — In an 
attempt to prevent a repeat of the Okla­
homa City bombing, President Clinton 
urged Congress to pass his anti-terror- 
ism proposal.
Clinton presented his proposal on 
Wednesday, one week after the explo­
sion that killed over 100 people.
The President was pleased with the
cooperation he was receiving from both 
parties and hoped it would continue.
When he spoke before the Senate Ju­
diciary Committee, the director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis 
Freeh, warned that terrorism is con­
stantly changing.
He said the FBI should receive better 
tools to fight it.

Speaker plans to pass Medicare
WASHINGTON, April 28, (DJ) — 
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., prom­
ised action this year on stand-alone leg­
islation that will rescue the financially 
shaky Medicare program.
In an appearance on Capitol Hill, the 
speaker said he will attempt to keep the 
legislation separate from a major défi­
cit-réduction bill—“it’s not tied into the 
budget” — and will work to ensure that 
every “penny” of future Medicare sav­
ings goes to ensure the solvency of the 
system, not reduce the deficit.
“Our goal will be, by September, to 
bring in a bill that will save the Medi­
care system for a generation,” Gingrich 
said.
Gingrich released to reporters the text 
of a letter he is sending today to Presi­
dent Clinton requesting recommenda­
tions on how best to shore up Medicare, 
which provides 36 million elderly indi­
viduals with government subsidized 
health insurance.
The speaker chided Clinton for ignor­
ing a report prepared by the trustees of 
the Medicare trust fund urging quick 
action to rescue the system and asked 
that the recommendations be delivered 
to Congress “no later than May15,1995.”
“We believe there is no excuse to ig­
nore the problem of Medicare, a pro­
gram that will spend more than it takes 
in next year, and will be completely 
unable to pay benefits in seven years,” 
the letter says.
The House Budget Committee is con­
sidering seven-year cuts of more than 
$300 billion in Medicare, a level of re­
straint that will bring the annual growth 
of Medicare down from 10.5 percent to 
about 5 percent.
Gingrich’s promise of a stand alone 
bill will almost certainly complicate 
matters for Budget Chairman John 
Kasich, R-Ohio, who has envisioned a 
balanced-budget plan that incorporates 
the Medicare fix. It was unclear whether 
Gingrich intended to prevent Kasich 
from counting Medicare savings toward 
balancing the budget, but the speaker 
did indicate Medicare savings should be 
kept in a “separate box.”
Said the speaker, “Every penny should 
go to Medicare.”
For deficit hawks, such a marker raises 
alarms. In 1994, President Clinton prom­
ised big savings from health care re­
form. But in keeping the effort outside of 
deliberations on the overall budget, the 
focus on deficit-reduction eventually 
evaporated in favor of policy reforms.
For Gingrich, the initiative represents 
an attempt to take control of the Medi­
care debate on the eve of a White House 
conference on aging. Next week’s confer­
ence is expected to be a platform for 
administration opposition to major 
changes in Medicare.
In his letter, Gingrich reminded 
Clinton that the White House proposed 
$118 billion in Medicare cuts as part of 
health care reform. “The administrat­
ion has indicated its support for incre­
mental reform,” Gingrich wrote. “Do you 
continue to support these proposals?”
Gas leak causes major explosion
TAEGU, South Korea, April 28 — At 
least 103 were killed on Friday in South 
Korea when a leaking underground gas 
line exploded during morning rush hour. 
The victims included children on their 
way to school.
There were at least 160 people in­
jured, some seriously. Meanwhile many 
were stuck under debris from a subway 
station under construction
The area of the explosion was a well- 
traveled road that had been evacuated 
due to the construction. It was covered 
with large metal plates that were said to 
fly in the air like dominoes after the 
explosion.
Officials said 56 of the dead were stu­
dents in their early teens from the seven 
middle schools in the vicinity.
Witnesses associate the explosion with 
a nuclear bomb exploding.
In the SongNam Middle School nearby, 
36 students were killed and over a dozen 
were missing. Teachers read roll and 
wrote the names of the missing students 
on the blackboard as classmates cried. 
In the schoolyard, students could hear 
the cries of grief from the parents, who 
rushed to the school.
The cause of the explosion was a spark 
that came from the construction and 
ignitedthe gas that was coming from an 
open pipe. There were over 100 cars and 
buses that were engulfed in flames while 
some fell 30 feet into the exposed pit.
One subway construction worker, Suh 
Mankyo, was working when the explo­
sion occurred. He was thrown into the 
air. When he regained consciousness, 
his co-workers were trapped under 
beams fighting for their lives.
Russia to trade nuclear reactors
WASHINGTON, April 28 — Despite 
strong opposition from the United States, 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei 
Kozyrev said he saw no reason to stop a 
plan to sell Russian nuclear reactors to 
Iran. This showed that no headway was 
made in talks between the Russian Min­
ister and President Clinton and Secre­
tary of State Warren Christopher.
The United States says that the reac­
tors will aid Iran in building nuclear 
weapons. The issue is sure to come up in J 
the US-Russian summit set to take place 
next month in Moscow.
The Russian Minister said that the, 
reactors will be under surveillance from, j 
the United Nations’ nuclear'watchdog 
body, the International Atomic Energy , 
Agency.
The reactors that Russia plans on sell- i 
ing are the same light-water kind that.i 
the U.S. was going to sell to North Ko­
rea. Their fuel is harder to use for weap-1 
ons.
The State Department denied any 
similarity in the two deals. Washington: 
said that North Korea may have already,*: 
developed nuclear weapons while Iran 
is several years away. However, Iran, 
claims it will not attempt to make them.
The U.S. says that Iran is quickly, 
acquiring nuclear technology. And that, 
no state should cooperate with Iran in 
obtaining their goal.
An official in Russia has said that, 
there is a possibility that Russia will 
provide Iran with a bomb-grade nuclear 
fuel with the reactors. This has added to 
the U.S.’s concern. The official who said 
that, Russian atomic energy agency chief 
Viktor Mikhailov, may not be backed by 
the Moscow government. So that por­
tion of the deal could not come about.
Kozyrev did say there might be a 
chance for the Russians to stop the trade; 
however the State Department is not 
confident the deal will be halted.
Currently, U.S. officials are working 
on a summit statement where Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin and Clinton give 
their positions on Iran and discuss their 
differences.
Kozyrev played down the threat that 
the Congress might retaliate.
Clinton appoints FNM members
WASHINGTON, April 28, (DJ) - 
President Clinton announced his inten­
tion Friday to reappoint four members 
to the Federal National Mortgage Asso­
ciation Board of Directors (FNM).
The four members are: William Daley, 
a partner in the Chicago law firm of 
Mayer, Brown & Platt; Thomas Leonard, 
a partner in the Philadelphia law firm of 
Obermayer, Rebmann, Maxwell & 
Hippel; John Sasso, a Washington con­
sultant; Jose Villarreal, an attorney at 
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld’s

following Mehrabian, Masloff spoke 
cfhow she came up through the ranks to 
ijjecome the first woman mayor in Pitts­
burgh history.
Mehrabian said Masloff was extremely 
kelpful when he first became president 
cfCMU in 1988 and continued to be very 
helpful through his remaining six years 
! office.
Masloff spoke on, “how to succeed in 
|[ie public sector as a woman.” She told 
;about her family history.
Following her speech, Masloff, with 
e help of Mehrabian, took questions 
¡from the many girls who were brave 
enough to stand up and yell their ques­
tions out.
After having a catered lunch, the girls 
moved on to either the tracks they signed 
for, or they went back to work with 
their hosts.
The tracks consisted of five different
programs which led the girls to three or 
four different locations on campus in 
order to attend different presentations. 
These tours were led by a student host 
and a staff or faculty host.
Cicozi stated that “everybody was hav­
ing such a good time, it was just one of 
those rare events on campus where 
people were smiling 
and laughing, and the 
girls were excited.”
She said that this year 
the program was kept 
on campus so that 
those who were plan­
ning the program 
would be able to get a 
feel of what to do, and 
how people liked the 
idea.
Rowina Lynch, who works in the Stu­
dent Health Service, took her 14- year- 
old daughter and her friend tocome into 
work to observe what she does during 
the course of a day.
Lynch stated, “[It] is remarkable that 
they have had so much planning here, it 
is not just a haphazard day where [the
girls] are just stuck in an office... the fact ferent backgrounds were allowed to see 
that they have a sampling all of the their parents or hosts in a more profes-

next year, but we were afraid to be that 
big this year.” She also added that, 
though most had feared that these young 
girls would be intimidated and wouldn’t 
ask questions, “they were so brave, they 
were jumping up and raising their hands 
and asking questions.”
Through this program girls from dif-

When asked about 
what she thought of the 
program, 13-year-old 
Hartwig said, “It has 
been really fun ... we 
have learned a lot of 
stuff on the computer; 
in Administrative Com- 
—puting we saw a new 
screen.”
Overall, Hartwig was excited about 
the program.
For some girls, the end of the day 
brought the chance to make a newslet­
ters. This gave the girls experience in 
graphic design.
The girls chose the title, wrote the 
articles, decided which graphics to use,
and had a souvenir to take home with 
them.
Kyra Ketter, a 10-year-old, came up 
with the title for the newsletter. When 
asked how she felt about her title being 
chosen, Ketter said, “I was surprised 
because I thought it might be boring [as 
compared to] everybody else’s.”
Ketter though that it would be fun to 
participate in the program again next 
year.
With over 150 people having attended 
the afternoon lunch, the organizers of 
the day were extremely satisfied. Cicozi 
said, “I had people come up to me [at the 
end of the day] and shake my hand and 
say if you need help I would love to work 
on [the program] next year, and that 
was the best compliment of all.”
This year marks the third year the Ms. 
Foundation has sponsored the program, 
which spans the country. Last year over 
25 million adults participated in the 
program.
This year’s projections stated that 
there would be between 40 and 50 mil­
lion participants, with a wide variety of 
corporate sponsors.
SDC kills smoking policy in 1-6 vote
SMOKE, from page 1
as the proposed policy (sections 
E & HI).
Therefore, Brian Bluth, a 
freshman biology major and a 
petitionedmember of SDC, pro­
posed that sections II & III be 
included in the current policy, 
but this was not accepted by 
SDC.
Junior CS major Paul Krier 
said, “[It seemed as though the 
policy was] put together be­
cause we can change it, not 
because there was a great need 
for it,” referring to the CMU 
Student Handbook which spells 
out the right to modify the 
smoking policy in the dorms. 
Smokers in the room com­
plained that the proposed policy 
appeared all of a sudden and 
Shifrin, a sophomore psychol­
ogy major agreed, saying, “[It 
was a] pretty cohesive decision 
[by SDC] that the process was 
rushed.”
In addition, the smokers 
thought that this was a bad 
time to approach the students 
with such an important issue, 
with finals fast approaching.
! A represented smoker, jun­
ior English major Dan Zabell 
stated that “It’s time to get a 
definitive policy on smoking, 
but this policy would be going 
in the wrong direction.” He 
spoke of different dorms hav­
ing different restrictions on the 
possible “smoking lounges” as 
described in section I.B of the 
proposed policy.
This also touched on Krier’s 
comment that more people 
would be hurt by the policy than 
helped.
The smokers agreed that it 
would be unfair to pass the 
policy unless a smoking lounge 
was guaranteed beforehand, 
remarking on the issue of hav­
ing to smoke outside in the win­
ter.
In response to questions re­
garding how well-informed the 
campus community was on the 
proposed smoking policy, 
Shifrin said “[I] thought that 
our PR chair put in a great 
effort to notify the campus, 
some of the setbacks... are due 
to several of the executives ... 
being new to the positions we 
occupy.”
In the end, Shifrin said, 
“We’ve decided that [the Smok­
ing Policy] is an issue impor­
tant enough to research more 
thoroughly.”
An anonymous observer 
feared, “[I’d] like to see this 
issue not brushed under the 
table.” Hannon said that even 
though he could“not come down 
on one side or the other,” he 
thought it “good that SDC is 
raising this for a discussion.”
Crime and Incident Reports
4/23 LOUD NOISE, 1:51 am. 
Campus police received a call that 
there was loud noise and drink­
ing in Morewood Gardens. Two 
officers responded to the call and 
encountered four males in the 
hallway. There were beer bottles 
around them. The officers counted 
about eight to 10 of them. All four 
were identified as residents of 
Morewood. One of the four was 
holding an open can of beer in his 
hand when the police arrived. 
The officer advised the males that 
a report would be filed with Stu­
dent Affairs and appropriate ac­
tion would be taken later since 
the officers did not have any in­
ternal citations on their person to 
give the suspects.
4/23 LIQUORLAWS, 2:28 am. 
While two officers were working 
uniformed patrol in the frater­
nity quad, they spotted three 
males exiting one of the fraterni­
ties. Upon seeing the officers, the 
youths started to head back. One 
appeared to be hiding a bottle 
from the view of the officers. When 
the suspects went back in the 
house, the bottle was left on the 
porch. The officer had to call sev­
eral times before the suspects 
came out. The suspects were not 
in possession of the alcohol, but 
their breath reeked of it. Two of 
the men admitted that they had 
been drinking. The third suspect 
changed his story several times. 
He insisted that he was drinking 
root beer and the bottle the of­
ficer saw him put down was not
his. The officer looked at the bottle 
was labeled as a brewed malt 
beverages. He said that he wasn’t 
a student at CMU and was only 
visiting his brother in the frater­
nity house. The officer said that 
since he was an out-of-state resi­
dent, he would be placed under 
arrest and have a hearing before 
a magistrate. The man then ad­
mitted to being a CMU student. 
The officer told the three sus­
pects they would all receive in­
ternal citing through the Student 
Affairs office.
4/23 CARELESS DRIVING,
2:56 am. A vehicle raced out from 
between BuildingD andE, nearly 
striking a campus police vehicle. 
The vehicle drove up the Bureau 
of Mines road towards 
Hamerschlag Hall. The officers 
stopped the vehicle, which was 
being driven by a CMU student, 
in the back of Wean Hall. The 
driver claimed that he was learn­
ing how to drive a stick. When he 
stopped at a stop sign and then 
proceeded up a hill, he gave no 
sign in his driving of someone 
learning howto drive a stick. The 
driver was issued an internal ci­
tation.
4/24 HARASSMENT, 12:40 
pm. A fem ale working at the Wok 
n Roll register said that another 
female opened the donut window 
and took a donut without using 
the tissue and sniffed it.
The worker told the female that 
she must purchase the food since
it was unsanitary to place food up 
to your nose and smell it without 
tissue paper. The suspect then 
yelled that she should smash the 
donut in the worker’s face. She 
then calmed down and said she 
had a bad day.

HOLOCAUST, from page 1
piping to Organize Awareness about the Holo- 
t) was the student organization which spon­
sored the construction and the other events of the 
ffeek. ,
Yungerman hoped that the installation made 
students think about the Holocaust. “The basic 
theme was to try to reach as many students as 
isible.” Freshman Mark Johnson, H&SS unde­
clared, felt that the installation definitely made 
iim aware of the tragedy. “[The] memorial should 
^member other minorities (gypsies and homo­
sexuals) as well [as the Jews].”
1 Other events that occurred during the week 
jncluded a poetry reading on prejudice and Nazi 
containment, a 24-hour reading of the names of
those who perished in Nazi concentration camps, 
and a dramatic presentation. The presentation, a 
true story, was a short play about a Jewish girl who 
almost died at the hands of a Nazi classmate.
Junior directing major Daniella Topol, respon­
sible for the 24-hour reading, said that approxi­
mately 4,500 of the 12 million names were read. 
Johnson said he felt humbled by the event. “ [The] 
reading of the names was there in public view. [It] 
made the students think about it.”
Topol expressed her gratitude to the campus 
community for their support through the week. “I 
was really impressed by the collective group who 
organized everything. People on this campus cared 
a great deal and were active politically, and I hope 
they continue in that direction,” she said.
The following are articles as they appeared in The 
Tartan:
50 YEARS AGO —The Tartan reported, “Coin­
ciding with the actual arrival of spring, Carnegie 
Tech gaily celebrated its traditional Spring Carni­
val from the first note of music sounded by Brad 
Hunt and his orchestra at 8 pm Friday night, until 
the last fading strain by Joey Sims and his orches­
tra at 1 am, Sunday morning. Although the depar­
ture of a large part of the ASTP created some doubt 
as to its success, the remaining GI’s, the civilian 
students, and the faculty joined the weatherman to 
make Spring Carnival one of the most outstanding 
social events of the season. An estimated 245 
couples were present on Friday evening, and nearly 
300 couples on Saturday, the conditions on both 
nights reminiscent of President’s Birthday Balls in 
Washington, DC.”
30 YEARS AGO—“Mrs. AlanM. Scaifeandher 
family, Koppers Comm. Inc., and Pittsburgh Plate 
Glass Company have joined in the support of a 
recently announced community program to aid 
under-motivated children from [economically] dis­
advantaged areas to attend college,” reported The 
Tartan.
“The pilot program, a joint venture of Carnegie 
Institute of Technology and the Pittsburgh Public 
School system, was established last month as a 
result of a $106,000 grant from the Carnegie Cor­
poration. The new funds, $12,000 from Mrs. Scaife 
and her family, and $2,000 from both Koppers and 
Pittsburgh Plate Glass, will enable Tech to begin 
plans for the first summer of the program immedi­
ately.”
25 YEARS AGO — The Tartan reported, 
“Duquesne University has found itself in a finan­
cial crisis so grave that the school may be forced to 
close down after the first of July when it will run 
out of money.
“The University President, Father Henry J. 
McAnulty, feels that the only hope for a long-term 
solution to the financial problems will be an in­
crease in state and federal funds directed towards 
the school.”
5 YEARS AGO — “For those of you who antici­
pated a finals period wrought with all-nighters, 
Director of Dining Services James Gurley has good 
news: The Tartan Grill will be opening 24 hours a 
day during finals,” reported The Tartan. “ ‘We 
recognize the stress of final exams and realize that 
students need a place to blow off some steam 
during their all-nighters/ says Gurley, ‘After nor­
mal closing hours we’ll be offering a limited menu, 
with some of our cooked items, but not all.’ ”

In the article, “Student Senate breaks bylaws,” the budgets for PSFB and WRCT were stated to 
be $21,000 and $45,556, respectively. The correct amounts were $31,000 and $40,559, respectively. 
The sidebar that ran along with the article listed the complete budgets passed by Student Senate, 
not the subsidies.
In the column, “Republicans push ‘nauseating!/ ironic legislature,” Patrick Hunt was described 
as a freshman. He is a junior.
The sports article, “Tartan squads compete in UAA Championships: Men take third; Women 
place fourth,” it was reported that Jeffrey Jones and Zack Conly came in third and fourth, 
respectively, in the 110-meter hurdles. They finished second and third, respectively.
In the article, “Students perceive racial divisions to varying degrees,” it was said that the 
Admission counselor quoted was Alison Green. Her name is Alison Green Jenkins.

Thistles and Thorns
Thistles and Thorns is the 
yearly review by The Tartan 
which congratulates or criticizes 
students, organizations, and the 
administration.
Our first Thistle and Thom 
will go to “construction.” AThistle 
for the progress on the Univer­
sity Center. It’s coming up fast 
and looking good. But a Thom 
for not being able to cadi it Sltibo. 
We haven’t gotten that $20 mil­
lion check yet. A Thistle for the 
new lawn outside of CFA. The 
architects restored its original 
design and it looks great, but a 
Thorn for cutting down the trees 
that once were there. Another 
Thorn goes to anybody who has 
ever painted a tree.
Thistles go to Mark Hamlin, 
Director of Dining Services, who 
ever since he has started at CMU, 
has tried to find out what stu­
dents want from Dining Services, 
and actually has been making 
improvements. AThistle for veg­
etarian chili and all the other 
food prepared for vegetarians. 
But a Thorn for moving Wean 
Wok to the Student Center, and 
for its new name “Wok-N-Roll.”
Thistles to the Carnival Com­
mittee, and all of the organiza­
tions who constructed booths. 
Thistles to everyone who partici­
pated in buggy, and for the new 
pavement on the course. AThom 
to AB for their choice of Yo La 
Who? for Carnival.
A big batch of Thistles go to 
student organizations for the 
work they’ve done this year. 
Thistles to the organizers of 
“Take Our Daughters to Work,” 
SHOAH (Students Helping to 
Organize Awareness about the 
Holocaust) for sponsoring a pow­
erful and moving Holocaust Me­
morial, EMS for all of its quick 
responses this year (most re­
cently when AEPi’s booth col­
lapsed), Black History Month 
and the organizers of the cam­
pus events, Chelsea Marnell and 
her co-organizers for planning 
the rape vigil, CMU Outreach, 
the Role Models Program, the 
Women’s Center, and a Thistle 
for the Take Back the Night 
march. The Thom here goes to 
the Administration who leaves 
anything memorializing or 
celebratory up to the students. 
Another Thorn to the adminis­
tration for not having an ad­
equate AIDS policy. Finally, 
Thistles go to anyone who has 
ever participated in a student 
organization. They are impor­
tant and need your support.
A Thistle goes to the return of 
Scotland Yard and a Thistle for 
Declan McCullagh for helping 
make it happen. Thorns go to the 
responsible parties for the lack 
of a Graduate Student Coffee­
house this year.
A batch of Thoms must go to 
Student Senate. First, a Thom 
to Declan McCullagh who re­
signed from the Presidency after 
accusations of abuse, harass­
ment, and financial misconduct. 
A Thorn also goes to the bboard 
censorship committee that was 
hand-picked by Erwin Steinberg. 
The committee was not repre­
sentative of the student body and 
meetings were kept closed to 
people who were interested. 
Thorns also go to Senate for 
breaking bylaws and saying 
that’s the way things have to go 
sometimes. A Thistle here goes
to the six percent of the students 
who did take time to vote in this 
year’s Presidential election, and 
Thom to those of you didn’t care 
enough to even pass by the table. 
The Student Body can’t complain 
if it doesn’t try to fix it, but an 
additional Thom to the Senate 
PR committee for being guilty of 
the same thing.
Thistles also go to CMU athlet­
ics this year like Men’s and 
Women’s soccer, Football, Vol­
leyball, Cross-Country, Rugby, 
Bowling, Track, Tennis, and all 
the others. A Thorn to the pro­
fessional athletes who thought 
that a million or so dollars each 
year was not enough to support 
their families, so they went on 
strike.
Thistles also go to this year’s 
Greek Sing which brought in 
money to the Make-a-Wish Foun­
dation. A Thistle to Panhel for 
expanding the sorority system. 
And a separate Thistle to Zeta 
for fighting to make it happen— 
Congratulations. Thistles also to 
the new fraternity, Sig Ep, that 
will be arriving, and to Sig Tau 
for getting a house. AThorn goes 
to Pi Lam with the unfortunate 
death of a student. However, 
Thoms also go to all the fraterni­
ties who have had to send their 
brothers to the hospital because 
of alcohol poisoning this year.
Thoms go to the tragedy sur­
rounding the crash of USAir 
flight 427. A Thorn also to gang 
violence which took the life of 
one of our friends. And a Thom 
to the local Pittsburgh media 
which only seems to report on 
CMU when something awful 
happens.
Thoms go to apathy amongst 
students, the tuition hike that is 
forcing some students to trans­
fer, the low retention rate, and 
the nine people who abstained 
from voting on the SDC Smok­
ing Proposal.
Thistles go to faculty evalua­
tions and all the department 
heads and deans who read them 
and respond. Thistles also go to 
Tim Foster in Residence Life and 
Dave Potter in Housing for send­
ing out surveys on student satis­
faction and maintenance. 
Thistles also go the new room 
draw system which kept us up- 
to-date on what was available 
and made it a whole lot easier, 
but a Thom for mailing out course 
catalogues.
Thistles go to Dean Murphy 
(and his wonderful assistant 
deans) who are always visible 
and accessible. Thistles to all the 
college deans for listening. A 
Thom to President Mehrabian 
for not always listening. Thistles 
also to the many professors here 
who are dedicated to students 
not just their research. Thistles 
also to Anita Barkin and Health 
Services.
A Thistle this year must go to 
the weather. We can’t complain 
too much about the sun not shin­
ing in Pittsburgh, since we had a 
very mild one and several days 
over 70 degrees.
Our final Thistles go to our 
graduating seniors: Mahua 
Dutta, Sam Greenfield, Rich 
Lubell, Chad McDaniel, Abby 
Schiff, Andrew Sproule, Katie 
Swango, Jason Roth, Richard 
Smolen, and John Weber. Good 
luck and take care. We will miss 
you.

Letter to the Editor
Editor:
I would like to com­
ment on the column per­
taining to the voter turn­
out, [4/10, “Campus apa­
thy harms proper repre­
sentation”]. There are a 
few reasons why last year’s Spring elec­
tion was more successful than this year’s. 
One of the main reasons is simply due to 
the location of the voting booth. Last 
year, it was located in Skibo, which 
served not only as the student center, 
but also was a shuttle pick-up point and 
where Entropy was located. For this 
reason, people were always passing in 
and out of Skibo whether they were 
attending Carnival or not. This year, the 
booth was located on Midway, so it was 
not as accessible to students. Also, last 
year there was an added concern placed 
on the ballot. This issue, the +/- grading 
system, may have led people who would 
not have normally voted to do so. The 
hours in which the elections were held 
were also more limited this year, mak­
ing it less convenient for students to 
vote. Alpha Phi Omega, who normally 
runs the elections, had many responsi­
bilities to handle, which made it difficult 
to hold the elections for longer hours.
On a more positive note, although voter 
turnout for the Spring was only six per­
cent, it went up two percent from the 
Fall semester. I served as PR chair on 
Student Senate for both the Fall ’94 and 
Spring ’95 elections. As long as I remain 
PR chair, I will increase the voter turn­
out each semester by a significant 
amount. I already have plans that will 
better inform the student body as to 
what goes on in Student Senate. If any­
one has any ideas or comments on how to 
help publicize Student Senate please 
feel free to email me at eg2h.

F&R use budgets for own agendas
advance their own agendas.
While many of us decry the 
administration’s attempts to censor 
netnews, our peers seem to be abusing 
their power to chill speech in an even 
more powerful fashion. While previous 
editorials in The Tartan have attributed 
disinterest in student government to 
apathy, I would suggest that disgust 
plays just as large a role. When the 
government becomes the personal ve­
hicle for a few students and position 
statements are banned from the election 
table in a mostly write-in election, it is 
no wonder that CMU students don’t 
seem to care about student government.

Editor:
Your coverage of the 
senate budgeting pro­
cess in [4/ 24, “Student 
Senate breaks bylaws] 
misses the point. The 
student government did 
not follow the letter of their bylaws in 
the most recent round of budgeting, but 
it is more important that they did not 
follow the spirit of these bylaws either. 
According to those involved in the 
Women’s Center budgeting process, the 
Women’s Center was told that it would 
be more likely receive a larger portion of 
its budget request if it became more 
mainstream, removed all potentially of­
fensive posters from its window, and 
perhaps organized a party for the 
Panhellenic Council. If F&R committee 
members want the Women’s Center’s to 
follow new policies, they should join the 
Women’s Center collective and propose 
new ones. Instead,they are treating

The CMU Muslim 
Students’ Association 
is shocked by the bomb- 
ing of the Federal 
Building in Oklahoma 
City and we extend our condolences to 
the families of the victims. We are also 
dismayed by the subsequent nationwide 
anti-Muslim hysteria. The prejudice 
erupted into intimidation, threats, at­
tacks, and shootings against Muslim 
individuals and institutions. A Muslim 
woman in Oklahoma miscarried after a 
mob attacked her home. AnArab-Ameri-. 
can became a suspect merely because of 
his ethnicity and was humiliated by U.S. 
and European authorities. Muslims were 
prevented from offering prayers at a 
national memorial service for the bomb 
victims.
Once the alleged bombers were identi­
fied as patriotic Mid-Westerners, not 
“typical” Middle-Eastemers, there were 
no more calls for the wholesale “deporta­
tion” of these “fanatics” with “terrorist 
mindsets” nor proposals to declare Michi­
gan a terrorist state. The myth of the 
“terrible Muslim” is perpetuated in part 
by lobbies and terrorism “experts” with 
vested interests in maintainingU.S. sup­
port for the unjust status quo in the 
Middle East. In the wake of the Okla­
homa bombing, such commentators bra­
zenly implicated American Muslim or­
ganizations without any proof. They also 
advocate the Omnibus Counter-terror­
ism Bill which selectively undermines 
the civil liberties of anyone arbitrarily 
considered undesirable, most likely an 
Arab or Muslim.
Bigotry against other minority groups 
would not be tolerated. Scapegoating 
Muslims is possible because of wide­
spread ignorance about Islam: peace 
and submission to The One Merciful, 
Benevolent God alone. It requires good 
works, justice and patience in the tradi­
tion of God’s messengers including 
Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and finally 
Muhammad upon whom be peace. The 
Oklahoma episode exposes the extent of 
distrust towards Muslims and condemn­
ing an entire people for the actions of a 
few isn’t acceptable.

[4/21, “Student Senate breaks bylaws”
and “Senate ‘rule-bending’ invalidates
authority”]. I counted no less than eight 
errors. In the article: Merle Atkinson 
had corresponded with all funded orga­
nizations regarding their subsidies and 
F&R’s recommendations, not a few. I did 
not rule on the intent of Atkinson’s cor- • 
respondence, but put the point to the 
Senate as a whole, since I was unsure on 
how to proceed. A vote to override fiscal 
policy does not need to take place at least 
a week in advance; notice must be given 
at least a week in advance. This was 
‘ fulfilled many times throughout the se­
mester, and therefore an overriding of 
fiscal policy was not in violation of the 
bylaws. To my knowledge, The Student 
Union did not dispute the F&R 
Committee’s budget cuts; Lenny Young 
was aware of the cuts and contacted 
Atkinson to inform him about the situa­
tion with the printer. Young was very 
pleased with the result of the budget 
hearings when I spoke with him on the 
phone after the budget meeting. Teresa 
Leonardo was made aware by Emma; 
Gosden, then Student Body Treasurer,; 
that PSFB would be taking a significant 
cut this year — her shock was not at 
being uninformed, but that it was pre­
pared by the Treasurer (appropriate, 
due to its status as an arm of Student 
Government). At least two members of 
the PSFB had at least partial knowledge 
of the cuts — Doug Hudson and Anat 
Gal-Or, Senate’s members. WRCT’s fi­
nal budget was $40,559, not $45,556 as 
your article erroneously reports. In the 
editorial: Senate did not violate several 
of our bylaws surrounding the budget 
process: we overrode the fiscal 
policy(which I admit s not a sign of a 
strong fiscal policy). All funded organi­
zations received electronic mail, cam­
pus mail, and other notification — over 
60 organizations, certainly not a hand­
ful! More constituents sought me out 
during budget cuts than during any part 
of the year. Those who cared about the 
budgets were informed. Also, you im­
plied that Senate does not make in­
formed, unbiased decisions during the 
budget process. I didn’t see any “unpro­
fessional favoritism” taking place dur­
ing the hearings; I felt confident that if 
a Senator amended a budget, it was 
what s/he felt was best for their constitu­
ents. Finally, I would like to state that I 
realize that during my administration 
as Senate Chair, not everything went to 
plan — yes, bylaws were violated and 
fiscal policies were overridden. If I’ve let 
“the right thing” get in the way of the 
rules, and was incompetent, I apologize. 
It was never intentional, only negligent. 
Good luck to the Student Body, and to 
the Stud.ent Government, remember that 
you represent the students to the ad­
ministration, not the other way around.

Take Our Daughters to Work day enriches lives
faÀMt g.tldz
Michelle Hall
When I was a kid, I used to go to 
work with my mother all the time. 
She’s taught first grade for over 
25 years in West Virginia, and 
whenever my school would have 
a snow day or no classes, I would 
go to school with my mom. The 
older I got, the more responsibili­
ties she would allow me to as­
sume in her classroom, from grad­
ing papers to conducting reading 
groups. At the time, it seemed 
like a fun and unusual way to 
spend a day, almost like make- 
believe. Today, I am beginning to 
see how being allowed to see how 
my mother spends her days and 
the importance of her work to the
countless students that have 
passed through her classroom 
has had an impact on my life 
and helped shape who I am. 
Being present in her workplace, 
among other things, has guided 
and assisted me in growing up to 
be a woman who is independent, 
self-sufficient, and hardworking 
— a woman who knows what 
she wants and how to get it. This 
past Thursday, April 27, was 
the third annual Take Our 
Daughters to Work day at CMU 
and throughout the country. 
Take Our Daughters to Work 
was launched by the Ms. Foun­
dation in 1993 as a means of 
empowering adolescent girls, 
who often experience low self­
esteem and negative body im­
age, by allowingthem to witness 
the different roles women can 
play in the work force and the 
value of those roles. At CMU,
the girls spentthemorning“shad- 
owing” their hosts in the work 
environment, 
attended a 
luncheon 
where former

ternoon at­

including sit­
ting in on a

about a career

visiting the
Infant Motor Development Lab, 
and finding out how high resolu­
tion 3-D images are produced and
used. When I saw the girls walk­
ing around campus, I began to

think about all of the girls who 
have never had the chance to 
see what their parents do at
work, never had the chance to 
see women excelling in a career 
that wasn’t mother or housewife. 
Over 25 million girls participated 
in Take Our Daughters to Work 
last year, and estimates pre­
dicted at least that many this 
year. I feel like this one day has 
really enriched the lives of 25 
million girls who may otherwise 
never have had the chance to 
experience an event in which the 
focus of concern was them. Do I 
think something like this can 
make a difference? Maybe not a 
huge one, but every little bit 
helps, even if what helps is sim­
ply the fact that these girls will 
know that someone is taking an 
interest in them. Also, Take Our 
Daughters to Work helps to dis­
pel misconceptions adolescent 
girls may have about what kinds 
of things women do and can do in

Oklahoma City bombing makes statement on society
McVeigh cannot be linked to militias
James Stepanek
A heinous act was committed recently. 
A lunatic parked a truck full of explosives 
in front of a federal building in Oklahoma 
City and murdered over 100 people in the 
explosion. This is the most serious bomb­
ing in U.S. history and has provoked a 
massive public outcry. Of course, some 
politicians have decided to use this atroc­
ity for their own political gain.
The current suspect who has been ap­
prehended is Timothy McVeigh, an army 
veteran who has been linked, by the press, 
to the Michigan Militia. He was found by 
virtue of a view from a security camera in 
a neighboring building, which yielded a 
sketch. McVeigh was found already in jail 
after having been booked on traffic and 
weapons charges, including driving with­
out a license plate. McVeigh had a history 
of expressing anger over the Waco debacle 
and, in fact, had been kicked out of the 
Michigan Militia due to his extremist 
views. The bombing was on the second 
i anniversary of the burning of the Branch 
Davidian compound.
The press is climbing all over them- 
. selves to tie this loony to all manner of 
organizations so that we can spread the 
blame. They say he’s in militias, right- 
wing fringe groups, and white suprema­
cist organizations. They’re trotting out 
1 every catch phrase which they’ve made to 
describe the allegiance of a loon. How 
about we blame him? Did he have to be 
associated with anyone else? What ever 
. happened to individual responsibility?
Nah, blaming just one loon, or even a 
small group of loons just won’t satisfy. 
s> They need the government to find a bunch 
of evil ones to smash. The lack of some 
.' Middle Eastern country to blame has re- 
| suited in a wide net being cast to find a 
convenient group to tar with responsibil­
ity beyond those who actually did the act.
Bill Clinton has lashed out against “pur­
veyors of hate” and “anti-government ex­
tremists” and their “loud and angry 
voices,” which he alleges caused this 
incident. Aside from the obvious as­
sault on First Amendment rights, this 
is an unseemly political ploy to lay the 
blame for this on his detractors. This is 
also an extremely hypocritical act com­
ing from a figure who repeatedly lashed 
out against the Republicans for “starv­
ing the children” over the school lunch 
program changes when, in fact, the 
amount of spending was not being cut 
and was actually being increased (even 
more than in his own budget). The me­
dia fascination with characterizing the 
militia movement as an “extremist right- 
wing fringe group” is another way to 
place blame and create a boogy man.
The militia group in question, the 
Michigan Militia, not only denied re­
sponsibility for the act and denounced 
it loudly, but actually threw the alleged 
perpetrator out for his extreme views. 
It has also been reported that they in­
formed the FBI and BATF of the man’s 
extreme views and his experimentation 
with explosives months ago. The list of 
the man’s associates was provided by 
the Militia. Of course most of the media 
hasn’t bothered to tell you this, though 
it was reported on ABC news.
What is the media doing? Well, they’re 
doing exactly what they shouldn’t: 
they’re egging people on. Look at the 
Omnibus Anti-Terrorism Bill which is 
being rushed through Congress since 
this bombing. You may remember me 
complaining about the Bill of Rights 
violations in the 1994 Crime Act. Well, 
compared to this, that’s nothing. This 
new bill grants sweeping new police 
powers to federal agencies, many of 
which don’t give even a nod to constitu­
tional rights. You may feel that this is a 
worthwhile thing since it will prevent 
future terrorist acts. Well, ask yourself 
which is worse — a possibility of a 
random terrorist act or a police state? I 
think I’ll go with Benjamin Franklin on 
this one, “They that can give up an 
essential liberty to obtain a little tem­
porary safety deserve neither liberty 
nor safety.”

Militias represent violence in America
Matt Ball
It would be fairly easy to write off the 
Oklahoma City bombing and murders as 
the work of a single isolated madman or a 
small group of maniacs. Indeed, Timothy 
McVeigh, who claimed the Army implanted 
a computer chip in his buttocks, seems to 
fit the stereotype ofthe over-the-edge loner.
Yet behind the handful of homicidal 
psychopaths, one finds a festering cess­
pool of paranoia and weaponry in the form 
of militias and “patriots.” These deluded 
and heavily-armed white males have 
stated that the Oklahoma bombing was 
actually perpetrated by the federal gov­
ernment in order to turn public opinion 
against their paramilitary groups; one 
faction said the bombing was a “planned 
distraction” of their commemoration of 
the end to the Waco standoff. In addition 
to the conspiracy theory, one militia 
spokesman claimed to “understand” the 
motivation behind the bombing, and an­
other person said that the bombing “does 
help in a sense that Waco was not forgot­
ten.”
The militias would be laughable if there 
weren’t at least tens of thousands of mili­
tiamen obsessed with weaponry, military 
confrontation, and the apocalypse. Accord­
ing to their view of the world, the United 
States is going to be divided into nine 
zones, the partitions of which were re­
cently illustrated on the back of Kix cereal 
boxes. The “mark of the beast” from the 
Book of Revelations has been sighted in 
federal fiscal policy. The government is 
secretly building concentration camps (un­
der the guise of the Endangered Species 
Act) and will march citizens into ravines 
and machine-gun them. Martial law is 
going to be imposed, the country will be 
ruled by the ZOG (Zionist-Occupied Gov­
ernment), millions will be enslaved, and 
sometime in the next century, “America’s 
white population will perish.”
These militias are not isolated from the
rest of society. The day of the bombing, a 
member of the Michigan militia faxed a 
pro-gun Texas Congressman about the 
bombing. Instead of turning the fax over 
to law enforcement officials, the fax was 
given to the National Rifle Association. 
Indeed, the NRA, representing millions 
of members infatuated with deadly force, 
has been given to its own fiery rhetoric, 
taking out full-page ads denouncing the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fire­
arms for a “tyrannical record of miscon­
duct and abuse of power.” Gun shop owner 
Bob Glass’ reaction to the bombing was “a 
fear that Clinton and Reno will take ad­
vantage of the tragedy to restrict freedom 
and pass further crackdowns on weap­
ons.” His store is doing a brisk business in 
AK-47s and Uzis.
Glass needn’t worry. Shortly after the 
bombing, President Clinton was asked if 
America is a violent society. His telling 
answer, in part, was that “many people, 
including this President, like to hunt.”
Is it possible not to see the Oklahoma 
City tragedy as the most visible symptom 
of our society’s obsession with violence? 
When everyone was hell-bent on blaming 
foreigners for the Oklahoma massacre, 
the solution proposed was to bomb the 
host country: an eye for an eye, ignoring 
all the other innocents who would be 
killed, who have been killed. How quickly 
we forget our destruction of a bomb-shel- 
ter in Iraq, which killed scores of inno­
cent women and children just as the “cow­
ardly terror” in Oklahoma City.
What does it say when our reaction to 
someone merely being questioned regard­
ing the bombing is to chant, “Bring him 
out, kill the creep?” How safe can we feel 
when millions are spent protecting our 
“right” to buy more semi-automatic weap­
ons and hollow-point bullets, while other 
people march around with signs ordering 
“God said kill fags” ? What can we expect 
when violence — against nature, other 
animals, other nations, other Americans 
— is accepted and unquestioned until a 
brutal bombing buries babies?
Real security will not come with stricter 
laws, but with a repudiation of violence 
by each of us, in our attitudes and ac­
tions.

CMU Student takes bogus journey back to the future
CaQV-obCWn
The other night I decided to take a 
trip in my super-deluxe time machine 
just to innocently snoop around in the 
lives of future people. Where did 
I end up? Low and behold, on the 
first floor of Hunt Library near 
the LaserKopy Center sometime 
in the not too distant future.
The first thing that I saw was 
this girl on a videophone, who 
appeared to be on the verge of 
losing her temper. I snuck up 
within earshot of her, pretend­
ing to leaf through a copy of 
Cyberspace Weekly.
“It’s ridiculous,” she scolded,
“that when I call you people up to 
make a very simple request, you 
refuse to acknowledge its valid­
ity. It’s inconceivable that a uni­
versity of this stature has an 
SES [Student Emergency Ser­
vice, I later found out] with such 
deplorable customer service! In 
the past, when I would run out of 
paper for my laser printer, you 
Would most courteously deliver 
me some into the wee hours of 
the night. There was even the 
time when one of your people 
most graciously composed a term 
paper for me when my wrist was 
sprained from playing too much 
golf. Therefore, I simply don’t 
understand where this lack of compre­
hension stems from.”
Whoa! By this point I was really won­
dering what this SES could have possi­
bly done to get her so worked up.
' “Unreasonable! My request is unrea­
sonable, you say? Well haven’t YOU 
6ver had a cold and not had a Synthewipe 
handy?... What! You actually think I 
would stoop to the level of sniffing! I 
have my standards .... Of course I’m 
aware that there is a reposing room 
downstairs. I go to school here, you
know.... Oh, I get it. So you expect me to 
walk down there and get some 
Synthetowel! Are you crazy? That would 
entail my walking up and down one 
entire flight of stairs! ... Well, yes, it 
would increase my life span by 6.932 
seconds, but... but... the stress of not 
Christy Callahan being able to blow my nose has probably 
taken just as much time off my life 
expectancy even as we speak, if not 
considerably more ... Well, now, that’s 
not such a bad idea at all. Finally, I’ll get 
some use out of that seminar, even be-
... but I have this, uh, Kleenex here,” I 
replied, thrusting the crumpled white 
wad in her direction.
“Oh,” she sighed, with droopy, down­
cast eyes. ‘That’s too bad. Those things 
cause cancer, you know. They found 
that out ages ago.”
And after an excruciatingly long pause, 
she began: ‘You wouldn’t be able to 
perhaps get some Sythewipe for me or 
something, would you? There’s a repos­
ing room downstairs and a vending ma­
chine on the-second floor.”
fore I have to look for a job.”
Silence.
When I look up from my magazine, I 
see that the man on the videophone 
screen has quit gesticulating. And the 
girl, oh boy, she’s staring straight at me 
with eyes that could shatter a piece of 
glass 15.78 cm thick.
“Hi there, you wouldn’t happen to 
have a Synthewipe, on you, would ya?” 
she cooed, with a toothy, glistening 
smile..
“Uh, no, I don’t have a... Synthe... um
So that’s what she was after! She was 
trying to turn something that was es­
sentially her own fault in to my problem, 
but I cut her off at the pass.
“Well, I’d really like to help you out,” 
I feigned, “but I’m not really from here. 
Where I come from, it’s normal for people 
to carry around Kleenexes ... I mean, 
Synthewipes.”
“That’s what people used to do in the 
Dark Ages,” she snapped back. “Nobody 
actually thinks that far ahead nowa­
days. I don’t know what school you go to,
but on this campus, things are designed 
to make life as convenient and carefree 
as possible. You can buy anything and 
everything 24 hours a day, from 
toothspray to tampettes, and pay for it 
through your Andrew account.”
“But what about the Boy Scout motto, 
you know, ‘Be Prepared’ and all?” I re­
plied. “I mean, when you refuse to take 
responsibility for your personal needs, 
you cause an incredible amount of in­
convenience for other people.”
“What are these concepts of ‘Boy Scout’ 
and ‘other people’ that 
you’re referring to? Why 
do things like the SES 
exist, if not to cater to my 
needs, when I want, how 
I want? As long as I can 
get a job that pays well 
after I get out of this 
place, I’ll be happy. 
That’s what I’m paying 
$8,000,000,000 a year 
for!”
“How can you possibly 
afford to pay such a sum 
of money?!” I sputtered 
in amazement.
“Well, my parents send 
the money each semes­
ter via interactive televi­
sion. That way I don’t 
have to go home to visit. 
I just record a little video 
for them, show ’em what’s 
going on, and then they’re 
satisfied. They’re happy, 
and I’m happy. You just 
don’t get it, do ya?”
“You know, you’re 
right, I don’t get it at all. 
I thought coming to col­
lege was all about learn­
ing how to become a responsible and 
genuinely caring person. I never fath­
omed that greed and egotistical could 
wreak such havoc on this place. But I 
guess I was wrong.”
Post Script: As depressing as this 
scene is, just remember that things don’t 
have to turn out that way if we decide to 
make a change for the better, starting, 
oh, right about now.

the workplace. On Thursday, the 
girls saw women perform in a vari­
ety of careers, some that they prob­
ably never considered. April 27 was 
not only a day during which girls 
could experience a sense of support 
at a difficult time in their lives, but 
also a day during which they could 
expand their horizons and open 
their minds to the countless op­
tions available to them that may 
seem so far away and unattainable 
at the present. I think the 75 girls 
who participated and the 175 people 
who attended the luncheon, can at­
test to that.
When it comes down to it, I feel 
like Take Our Daughters to Work 
is the same kind of thingmy mother 
did for me, only on a grander scale. 
The enthusiasm and care shown by 
CMU’s organizers of the day was 
wonderful, and the willingness of 
female students to act as escorts for 
the girls during the afternoon cer­
tainly helped to make the day a 
success. I think everyone who 
helped make Take Our Daughters 
to Work Day 1995 a success de­
serves a standing ovation. Some 
people may question the effective­
ness of a program like Take Our 
Daughters to Work . After all, it is 
only one day. But I happen to think 
even one day can make a difference, 
and it’s certainly better than noth­
ing. It doesn’t try to solve all the 
problems experienced by young 
girls. I think we need more things 
like Take Our Daughters to Work. 
Believe me, to an adolescent girl 
who lacks self-confidence or per­
haps feels like many doors are closed 
to her, this program, and hopefully 
others like it, could be one step in 
taking control of a girl’s life and 
doing with it everything and any­
thing she may want; one step in the 
right direction.

Stereotyping people, organizations as 'good’ or ‘evil’ displays foolish, naive behavior
The Editor’s Notebook
! The Editor’s Notebook presents the individual 
opinions of the author only, and not necessarily the 
opinions of The Tartan or the Editorial Board.
. Nobody gives a damn about what happens on 
this campus. Students only care about blowing off 
classes and graduating to a high-paying job. Pro­
fessors without tenure just want to get tenure, and 
professors with tenure just care about research 
money. Administrators only care about making 
ihemselves look good, and staff members’ greatest 
concern is their next coffee break.
Of course, none of the previous paragraph is 
completely true.
Everyone sacrifices for this campus. The great­
est concern of students is helping other people on 
campus. Professors, regardless of tenure status, 
teach and research for the betterment of human­
ity. Administrators try to make this the best cam­
pus in the country and staff members give every­
thing they can to make Carnegie Mellon a better 
place.
Not every sentence in the previous paragraph is 
completely true, either.
Most, if not all, people on this campus would like 
to believe that there are “good” and “evil” people on 
this campus because we like to think there are 
people who are always “right” or “wrong.” How­
ever, there is not one organization which only does 
“good” or “evil.”
Let’s examine Student Government. Student Gov­
ernment has always and will continue to break 
their own rules on whim and pass questionable 
legislation. “Aha!” We say, “Student Government 
is evil and must be abolished.”
Let’s take another look at Student Government. 
Members of Student Government are not paid. 
They are infrequently praised, and some members
of Student Government have spent over 40 hours 
per week working for other students while taking 
a full schedule of classes. So is Student Govern­
ment “evil?”
Now let’s inspect the Activities Board (AB). They 
can spend their huge budget on anything they 
want to. They can bring in entertainment acts 
solely for their own pleasure and can pick and 
choose what movies are shown on campus. For 
most of the school year, they control campus enter­
tainment. It is easy for us to say, “AB is an evil 
group who never brings in entertainment for us.” 
However, there is another side to AB. The execu­
tive members of AB will frequently work long 
hours without pay to bring entertainment to the 
campus. Their work is incredibly stressful and 
they are also infrequently praised. Is “evil” really a 
good adjective to describe AB?
The administration of CMU is always a nice 
group to scorn. After all, not only wtil they censor 
student groups, but also they are driven to provide 
the most inconvenient construction and worst food. 
Depending on who you ask, they are dedicated to 
either eliminating or pampering the Greek system.
Certainly, we can say, “The administration is 
evil\”
However, before cursing the administration, we 
should take a second look. There are administra­
tors who put in over 60 hours per week solely to 
make all students’ lives better. There are admin­
istrators who really care what people think, and 
who place others above themselves. Those admin­
istrators realize that the purpose of CMU’s ad­
ministration is to make CMU a better place. Is the 
administration truly “evil?”
We can examine every group on this campus. 
We can study every student, professor, staff mem­
ber, and administrator. There is not one person or 
group on this campus that is solely “good” or “evil.” 
To believe otherwise is at best naive, and at worst 
foolish.
As the semester draws to a close, try to keep this 
in mind. Use the last week of classes to reevaluate 
those people who you have pigeonholed as “evil” 
and remember to give thanks to those people who 
you feel have done “good” deeds for campus.

New lease may ease financial problems for fraternities
Michael P. Foster
¦ After one and a half years of 
meetings, the Lease Negotiations 
Cbmmittee has finally proposed 
dn official draft to the University 
fbr approval. The committee, 
headed by David Potter, the di­
rector of Housing, and Michael 
poster, Delta Upsilon spring 
. president and former IFC house 
manager, set out to make vast 
improvements on an obviously 
ihadequate lease. The terms of 
the lease and the cost per year 
have been major causes of strain 
ihfraternity-University relations 
for the past couple of years.
! Problems with the soon to be 
outdated lease included lack of 
planned maintenance, costs cov­
ered/not covered by the lease, and 
lack of accountability for either 
party.
The continually increasing cost 
of the houses is the biggest prob­
lem facing the system. In just the 
past three years, the 
cost per house has 
risen from $84 thou­
sand to $105 thou­
sand dollars — a 25 
percent increase, or 
eight percent a year.
The average in­
crease for residence 
halls is between 
three to four percent 
a year. The reason 
for this increase can 
be attributed to the 
former lease and the 
lack of planning of 
the Housing Office 
in the 1980s (Dave 
Potter arrived in 
1992). Many frater­
nities have had 
problems dealing 
with the large in­
crease, and there­
fore are having difficulty staying 
afloat financially.
O ne imp ortant thing to remem­
ber is that the Fraternity System 
is closed — all lease money col­
lected returns to the fraternities 
in the form of services and debt 
retirement. None of this money is
manded no maintenance or gen­
eral upkeep of the houses. Also, 
no money was put into a capital
distributed outside of the system 
(i.e., residence halls, campus 
maintenance). During the early 
’80s the University and fraterni­
ties agreed upon a lease that de­
Francine Gemperle /Tartan Co-Art Editor
reserves to help offset future capi­
tal improvements. Around 1990, 
the conditions of the houses were 
so poor that the City of Pitts­
burgh required that the houses
either be brought up to code or be 
condemned.
A large scale project was en­
deavored in a cooperation of IFC 
and the University. Because 
there was no capital reserve bud­
get, a loan of over $1.8 million 
dollars was taken out at a fair 
market interest rate. This loan 
paid for new bathrooms, new 
kitchens, new roofs, new heating 
systems and wiring and new win­
dows for each house.
In order to repay this loan, 
and establish a capital reserve 
budget, the rate of rent increase 
was accelerated. Instead of the 
usual increase comparable to resi­
dence halls, increases of up to 13 
percent per year were imposed on 
the system. After much thought 
the rate was decreased to six per­
cent for the last two years, and 
for the fiscal year 1997 (school 
year ’96 —’97) it will be compa­
rable to residence halls.
This eye-opener called for a 
complete restructuring of the 
lease. The new lease has many 
practical and beneficial terms in 
it. Some of the changes in the 
lease have already been imple­
mented, such as a new sign-over 
process, better housekeeping ser­
vices provided, and reimburse­
ment on modest capital improve­
ments to individual houses.
Other terms include account­
ability for maintaining capital 
budgets, retiring debt and the 
elimination of the collection re­
serve.
Overall, the new lease holds 
the very best interests of the fra­
ternities in its terms. Over a dozen 
people worked on the current 
lease, of which two represented 
the University, two represented 
Greek alumni, and eight repre­
sented the undergraduate frater­
nities.
It is too early to tell whether or 
not the new lease will help those 
fraternities that, because of their 
fiscal problems, are facing dwin­
dling memberships and large 
bills.

Tartan Sports: Year in Review
Rugby Club defeats Eastern Region Champs in overtime
Andrew McDermott/1 artan h-notograpner
Lock Haven needed more than one man to bring down the Tartans in 
their matchup last Saturday afternoon.
By SUDHDR REDDY
Tartan Staff writer
The Carnegie Mellon Rugby 
team became the Division II 
Champions for Ohio, West Vir­
ginia, and Pennsylvania this past 
Saturday with a 22-17 sudden 
death overtime victory at the In­
tramural Field.
CMU, the Midwest Regional 
Champions, capped off an unde­
feated season with a victory over 
Lock Haven University, the East­
ern Regional Champions. Both 
teams won their respective con­
ference titles back during the fall 
season of 1994.
Senior John Crowley, president 
for the club, said, “It was a tough 
victory but it feels great to win.”
Playing against a tough defense 
and quick forwards, CMU was 
down two tries early in the con­
test.
The team made a dramatic 
comeback with three players scor­
ing for CMU, sophomore and cap­
tain Javier Rocha, fifth-year se­
nior Brad Lawrence, and captain 
Ed Hanna. CMU kept scoring and 
putting pressure on Lock Haven 
by using its faster and more agile 
backs.
A disadvantage which CMU 
faced against Lock Haven was its 
weakness in scrum downs. How­
ever, Crowley said that the team 
played good loose ball which was 
one of the keys to the CMU come­
back.
Earlier in the week, the team 
won the Hooligan Bowl over Indi­
ana University of Pennsylvania, 
Slippery Rock University (two 
Division I teams), and South 
Pittsburgh Men’s Club. The team 
defeated South Pitt (22-5), and 
IUP (15-0).
According to fifth-year senior 
Mike Keller, CMU was down in 
both games. “[We] were expected 
to lose big, but we came alive in 
the second half [after] a stale­
mate in the first half,” he said.
The Rugby team is a student- 
run organization, but is permit­
ted to play experienced Division I
schools. CMU usually has a ros­
ter of 20 to 24 players while most 
Division I schools have rosters of 
30 to 40 players. According to 
Crowley, the small size fits 
Carnegie Mellon because it builds 
team unity. Crowley credits the 
team’s exceptional stamina for 
its success. “Our 15 players are 
very quick and play hard. We 
have a lot of great athletes on the 
team.”
Keller also credited the play­
ers’ involvement for the success-' 
ful season. “Most of the players 
don’t have high school experience,' 
so they must learn the game and 
form a sense of cohesiveness.” .
Keller expressed enthusiasm 
over the team’s successful sea­
son. “There was general excite­
ment throughout the season, and 
I feel that success builds upon 
itself.”

Since almost all Carnegie Mellon 
teams have completed their seasons, the 
Tartan Sports staff had nothing better 
to do than to call for the instant replay 
and take a look back at the past year in 
Tartan sports.

Carnegie Mellon, who ranked as high 
as 15th in pre-season Division III polls, 
opened the season in fine fashion, trounc­
ing Franklin and Marshall, 35-0. They 
then fell to Allegheny, 37-22. The Tar­
tans won their next two games to im­
prove to 3-1, but then lost two in a row 
including a 35-26 decision to the Uni­
versity of Washington of St. Louis. The 
Tartans went on to win their remaining 
four games, including a season-ending 
50-8 victory over Case Western Reserve 
in the Academic Bowl, to end the season 
at 7-3 overall. They finished with a 
record of 3-1 in the UAA for a share of 
the championship.
Post-season honors abounded for the 
Tartans, who placed 20 players on All- 
UAA teams, including nine on the first 
unit. Leading the way was senior quar­
terback Chris Dee, who was named all­
conference for the second time. Dee fin­
ished as the Tartans’ second all-time 
leading passer with 4,991 yards. Other 
first-teamers included senior running 
back Jason Grusky, senior receiver Matt 
Neiss, junior tight end Aaron Neal, jun­
ior offensive guard Sean Keene, senior 
offensive tackle Kevin Keir, senior de­
fensive tackle Atkinson, junior defen­
sive back Rob Locke, and sophomore 
placekicker Todd Smith.
WOMEN’S SOCCER
The Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer 
team had a breakthrough seasoninl994, 
going 13-3-2 (4-1-1 in the UAA) and 
losing a chance at the UAA Champion­
ship on a penalty kick in their last game. 
The team finished ranked fifth in the 
Great Lakes region, and sophomore goal­
keeper Jill Weber earned first-team All- 
America honors.

Having picked up their first win in 
UAA competition in 1993, the team 
climbed steadily to the top of the stand­
ings in 1994, but a 2-1 loss to the Uni­
versity of Chicago in the last game of the
year cost them a chance at the title, and 
they settled for third place. The loss 
snapped a 10-game unbeaten streak, 
including nine wins and eight shutouts. 
The team had earlier rung up a five- 
game unbeaten streak.
Weber, a two-year starter, led the way 
in 1994 with a 0.67 goals-against aver­
age, all 13 wins, and 10.3 shutouts. On 
offense, junior forward Nicole Poisson 
led all scorers with 32 points, including 
a team-leading 13 goals and six assists. 
Sophomore Alyssa Newman also hit 
double-digits in goals with 10, finishing 
with 24 points, good for second on the 
team. Sophomore Mae Hogan, seniors 
Julie Paul and Christina Isaly, and fresh­
man Kim Umeda also hit double-figures 
in points.
MEN’S SOCCER
The men’s soccer program had a spec­
tacular year and acheived a long-sought- 
after goal, the NCAA playoffs. Their 
skills, team work, and speed brought

them a 13-3-2 overall record and a 5-1- 
1 UAA record. Early in the season, the 
Tartans tied eventual UAA champs 
Washington University. A late-season 
loss to Brandeis cost them the UAA title, 
but they kept their fourth-place ranking 
in the Mid-Atlantic Region to qualify for 
the playoffs. In the first round, they 
played Muhlenberg College to a 0-0 tie 
in 120 minutes of scoreless play before 
they lost 3—2 in a shootout.
Six players from the squad earned All- 
UAA honors. Senior forwards Alex 
Amezquita and Mike Brazinski received 
first-team honors. Freshman midfielders 
Jason Buelow and Akira Imai, senior 
midfielder Pat Lucignani, and senior 
goalkeeper Dan Warren earned second 
team honors. Buelow led the team in 
goals with 12 while Amezquita led the 
Tartans with 27 points off of nine goals 
and nine assists.
VOLLEYBALL
The women’s volleyball team had a 
disappointing season as it finished tied 
for seventh in the UAA Championship 
Tournament. The lone win came over 
the University of Chicago, 3-2. Patty 
Bruno, the Tartan middle-hitter, won 
an Honorable Mention All-UAA award.

The Tartans went 9-27 overall, and 1—

included a fourth place finish out of 10 
teams at the Gallaudet University Invi­
tational Tournament, where they ad­
vanced to the semifinals. The following 
weekend, the women traveled to the 
WestemMarylandNorth-South Classic 
and went 2-3.
CROSS-COUNTRY
The women’s team had a successful 
season, placing third at the UAA Cross- 
Country Championships. Junior Mel­
issa Baustert made first team All-UAA, 
with a time of 18:43 for the 5,000-meter 
course. Three women made second team 
All-UAA, as freshman Melissa Lott 
placed 11th, sophomore Becky Buchheit 
placed 12th, and junior Sangita Jinwala 
placed 13th. The women’s season began 
with a win over California University of 
Pennsylvania. They then placed second 
at the California Invitational, losing only 
to Slippery Rock, a top Division II team. 
Late in the season, the team took first at 
the Hiram Invitational, followed by a 
third place finish out of the 20 teams 
attending a meet at Dickinson College.
The men’s team placed fifth at the 
championships, with junior Matt Beam 
finishing 17th in a time of 25:53 for the 
8,000-meter course. Close behind him 
were junior Scott Moore, who placed 
20th, and sophomore Ron Polcawich, 
who placed 22nd. Earlier in the season, 
the men finished second in the Califor­
nia Invitational. The team then finished 
fifth of 20 teams at the Indiana Invita­
tional, defeating all other Division III 
teams, as well as several Division II 
teams. The harriers won the Hiram In­
vitational meet, with Moore leading the 
team with a 27:40 finish.
SWIMMING
The men’s swim team did extremely 
well this season, placing second at the 
UAA Championships, despite their lack 
of a diving team. Junior Matt Moe took 
first in the 200-yard breaststroke and 
set a school record time of 2:08.9. Moe 
also placed second in the 400-yard IM 
and fourth in the 500-yard freestyle, 
achieving national qualifying times in 
both events. Junior Geoff Waller took 
first in the 400-yard IM and 200-yard 
butterfly, also achieving national quali­
fying times. Junior George Schmidt 
placed third in the 200-yard butterfly 
and freshman J ake McGuire placed third 
in the 200-yard butterfly. The 800-yard
freestyle relay was also an exceptionally 
strong event, as McGuire, Waller, junior 
Mike Berty, and Moe placed second in a 
national qualifying time of7:00.82. CMU 
head coach Jim Cutrone and assistant 
Jon Kline earned Coaching Staff of the 
Year honors.
The women’s swim team placed sev­
enth at the championships, due to a 
younger and less experienced squad. 
Junior Rebecca Fruehan had yet an­
other extraordinary performance, win­
ning the 500-yard freestyle, 200-yard 
freestyle, and the 100-yard freestyle. 
She broke her own UAA record in the 
200-yard freestyle, and was named Co- 
Swimmer of the Meet. The 800-yard 
freestyle team offreshman JenDeFlippo, 
freshman Carly Cenedella, sophomore 
Christina Hagopian, and Fruehan came 
in second. School records were set in the 
400-yard medley relay by the team of 
DeFlippo, freshman Jen Supancic, 
Cenedella, and Fruehan, and in the 400- 
yard freestyle relay by the team of 
DeFlippo, Cenedella, Hagopian, and 
Fruehan.
The swimming teams were repre­
sented well at the Division III Swim­
ming Championships. Moe, Waller, and 
Fruehan earned All-American honors.

Piranhas may soon claim, ‘We’re number two!’
CBA team could win second-best basketball league
Below the Rim
by Darren Chiappetta
As we embark upon the final install­
ment of “Below The Rim,” I am filled with 
mixed emotions. Happy, because I don’t 
have to worry about having to write any 
more columns at the last minute. Sad, 
because ... well, I’m sure there’s some 
reason I should be sad, but I’m so busy 
watching all the NBA playoff games I 
can’t think of it.
• Anyway, I’ll (sniff!) miss having the 
chance to write for all of you wonderful 
people on a weekly basis, and I hope our 
paths cross again someday. I love you all, 
my friends!
Yeah. Anyway, for my final column, I 
thought I’d go for a little local flavor. As 
many of you probably know, the Pitts­
burgh Piranhas are currently playing in 
the Continental Basketball Association 
finals. Unfortunately, there are no more 
opportunities to catch the Piranhas in 
the Steel City this season, since the last
games of the finals will be played.on the 
road.
Last week, Piranhas’ first-year head 
coach Don Zierden talked about the team’s 
initial season in the ’Burgh.
“It’s been a fun first year, [especially] 
the last two months,” he said. “A lot of 
coaches don’t ever get to the finals. I’m 
really enjoying it.”
The Piranhas’ road to the finals has 
been a strange one. The team finished 
with a sub-.500 record at 27-29, and had 
one of the league’s lowest point totals 
(the CBA’s system of awarding each 
team three points for a vie-., 
tory and one point for each 
quarter won determines team 
standings).
In spite of the fact ^ 
that Pittsburgh fin­
ished in fifth-place in ^ 
the six-team American 
Conference in both 
record and points, they 
received a first-round bye in the 
playoffs, in part because two 
members of their division folded 
at mid-season. That left the Fort Wayne 
Fury as the Piranhas’ only competition 1 
in the Northern Division, and since Fort 
Wayne finished at 24-32 and 171.5 points, 
the Piranhas won the division title and a 
pass to the second round.
Head coach Don Zierden said that the 
departure of Hartford and Harrisburg 
wasn’t that big of a deal.
“I was actually kind of upset they 
folded,” he said. “We had six games left 
with both, and we’d played really well 
against them.”
After the bye, Pittsburgh dispatched 
the Rockford Lightning and Chicago Rock­
ers in rounds two and three to reach the 
finals against the Yakima Sun Kings. In 
so doing, the Piranhas became only the 
fifth team in the league’s 48-year history 
to make the finals in their first year in a 
new city. They won the Mideast Division 
title last year as the LaCrosse Cat­
birds.
0 In a league where turnover is a 
‘ \Sl term that refers to the composi­
tion of team rosters rather than a 
player’s ability to hold on 
to the ball, Zierden at­
tributes much of the 
team’s success to its 
relative stability.
Despite the fact that 
over 20 players have
0 shuffled in and out of Pitts­
burgh over the last five 
months, Zierden says he’s been, 
“really lucky. I’ve had loyal players — 
we’ve got six players (out of 10) playing in 
the finals that we had in training camp.” 
Zierden also credits the fans for helping 
the Piranhas reach such lofty heights. 
Indeed, of late, the team has drawn much 
better than their league-worst attendance 
average of just under 2,000fans per game, 
and in Game Four of the finals, played on
Friday night, the crowd was announced 
at over 4,200.
“I’m excited about the way the team 
has caught on in the city. The fans are 
starting to identify with the players. 
There’s a bright future here.”
Zierden also sees a bright future for 
the CBA. “As long as we keep our rela­
tionship with the NBA, we’ll be the sec­
ond-best league in the world. I really 
believe that.”
He applauds the recent decision by the 
league to remain at 14 teams next sea­
son, and sees Hartford and Harrisburg 
as victims of their own poor manage­
ment, not the CBA’s. “They were doomed 
to fail from the get-go,” he said, and 
pointed specifically to the poor organiza­
tion within the Harrisburg franchise. 
“They didn’t even name a head coach 
until a week before the season,” he said.
Right now though, Zierden has his 
mind set on only one goal — the CBA 
championship. “There are 10 players on 
this team, and I desperately want a ring 
for them,” he said. He’d also like to re­
ward team owner Robert Murphy, who 
hired the man with no prior professional 
head coaching experience before this sea­
son. “Mr. Murphy has been a great owner 
for me as a head coach,” he said. “He took 
a gamble on a rookie coach, and I hope to 
pay him some dividends.”

major.

team’s respect and record improved. For 
the first time, the CMU men’s team was 
seeded in the UAA tournament. Although 
they had hoped to accomplish more, the 
season with a fifth place finish.
Although the women’s team struggled 
tliis season, they have most of their start­
ers returning next season. Inexperience 
hurt the team but the young players 
learned throughout the season, and their 
experience will help strengthen next 
year’s team. Next year’s team will be 
losing the talent of Stephanie Kukura 
but will return everyone else — junior 
Namita Amin, freshman Shuana Quill, 
junior Miriam Huang, sophomore Michele 
Cook, and freshman Jackie Autieri. 
TRACK
The Carnegie Mellon men’s and 
women’s track and field teams enjoyed a 
successful year. The indoor UAA champi-
onships saw the

151 (72-79) which was three strokes 
better than the second place finisher.
The team also placed well in several 
tournaments in the course of the season. 
They finished third of nine teams early 
in the season at the Speidel Invitational, 
with junior Gregg Lassan, senior Josh 
Kenin, and junior Rick Rothranff all do­
ing extremely well. The team later placed 
10th of 15 teams amidst tough competi­

Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
The emotions ran high. It was a perfect spring 
night, a slight breeze was blowing, and major 
leaguers were taking the field for the first time 
since mid-August of 1994.
I wasn’t really sure how to feel or react. On a 
normal opening day, I would have been swept by 
the enthusiasm __________________________
and energy of a 
sold-out, opening 
day audience.
But being that 
this was no typical 
opening day, and 
this was definitely 
not a typical open­
ing day audience 
(barely 30,000 at 
Three Rivers Sta- 
dium), I wasn’t
sure whether to sing “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” 
or contribute to the barrage of Pirates pennants 
which were thrown out on the field in the fifth 
inning.
Welcome to Major League Baseball, 1995 style.
the bright side is that the fans have finally come to 
their senses and have started to show their disgust 
with the situation by staying away from the park.
I never thought there would come a day when I 
would advocate as little baseball as possible in the 
life of the average American. Unfortunately, I 
don’t have the willpower to stay away from the 
game. As for everybody else though, my advice is to 
stay away, and keep staying away as long as 
possible, for this is the only way to bring the game 
back to its true owners — the fans.
Let us not forget the fact that we make the 
players, managers and CEO’s who they are. With­
out us and our money, they would be nothing. Most 
of them don’t have a college diploma and would be 
bagginggroceries at the neighborhood Giant Eagle 
if it wasn’t for the $14 we spend per ticket and the 
$5 we spend for a warm, watered-down beer.
The tension that we face results from the con­
stant conflict between the love for the game and the 
hatred for the scum that play it. Our feelings for
____________________________ nine innings,
three outs, and 
90 feet remain 
the same, but 
they are tar­
nished by the 
greed of those 
who perform.
It is extremely 
vital that fans 
maintain their 
stance against 
the ballplayers

though, for it is the only way to pull them and all 
their cronies down from the pedestal which we 
have placed them on.
Eventually the game will return to normal, and 
hopefully it will return to us. Baseball is, and 
The game has reached an all-time low in terms of always will be, the national pastime. The phrase
both quality of play and fan support.
Balls are going everywhere but in the strike zone 
and in the glove. Objects not wrapped in leather 
are finding their way onto the playing field. The 
locals look more like their replacement predeces­
sors and the replacement umpires look more like 
clowns.
Is there a bright side to the ’95 season? Yes, and
“national” is the key, for it is important to remem­
ber that the game belongs to the country and not to 
a collection of spoiled millionaires.

ESPN acts hypocritically during draft coverage
Is there a draft in here?
by Vernon Harmon
It’s late April and for all of us football- 
starved NFL fans, that means it’s Draft 
time. Last weekend was the NFL’s 1995 
College Draft. ESPN and ESPN2 had 
yel-to-gavel coverage of the event. 
Unfortunately, they dropped the ball.
Yes, they were there for the entire 
event, and yes, they constantly rolled 
the picks across the bottom of the screen. 
However, after the first 30 or 40 picks it 
was impossible to follow the numbers 
scrolling across the bottom of the screen, 
especially since they kept interrupting 
the list to announce the current pick. 
This “current pick” was usually about 
two picks behind by the second day. 
They also rarely recapped the most re­
cent picks when they came back from 
commercial breaks so it seemed like we
the viewers just kept missing more and 
more.
The first round began rather well. Mel 
Kiper Jr., Chris Berman, and Joe 
Theismann recapped the picks regularly 
and elaborated on the player who was 
chosen. But then Warren Sapp, the 
former defensive tackle from the Uni­
versity of Miami, didn’t get picked. Ap­
parently this troubled the folks at ESPN, 
but I don’t know why. They had been 
reporting since Friday that Sapp had 
failed drug tests throughout his career 
at Miami. In the past, teams haven’t 
seemed to care too much about that kind 
of thing, but apparently more intelli­
gent attitudes have prevailed.
Teams with a serious need for defen­
sive linemen were passing over Sapp for 
either other linemen or other positions 
entirely. Sapp and his agent were sud­
denly all over ESPN crying and whining 
about how the media was circulating 
false rumors, and Sapp claimed he had 
never tested positive. Then Tampa Bay 
finally drafted him. And what happened? 
Sapp then admitted he had tested posi­
tive for marijuana — twice. ESPN con­
tinued to rerun the story ad nauseum for 
the next 36 hours at the expense of
quality draft coverage! Personally, I ap­
plaud the rest of the NFL for finally 
making a stand on drugs and players 
who do them. And I’d like to give ESPN 
a big raspberry for constantly rerunning 
the story and trying to make Sapp out to 
be some kind of victim. Hey, ESPN, he’s 
a big boy. He did drugs by choice. He lied 
about it to the entire NFL and everyone 
who was watching. He should pay the 
consequences, and I don’t mean only 
getting $5 million instead of $12 million! 
It’s about time somebody starting set­
ting a good example for our children — 
somebody like Ki-Jana Carter.
I saw Carter’s press conference after 
the Draft. He said he’s not concerned 
with signing a huge contract. He just 
wants to show what he can do and to be 
a role model. He was the number one 
overall pick last week in the draft, and 
this past week, he was in Happy Valley 
finishing his exams so that he could 
graduate with a marketing degree. Now 
that is the kind of example we need to 
see more of in the NFL ... or more ex­
actly, the kind of example our children 
need to see more often.
Vernon Harmon is very, very special to 
The Tartan.

In only a day, the ants have lifted their monuments to the firmament.
In only a day, the flying gnats have emerged from the water.
But who am I? I am called man. I am bent and heavy with inner organs.
The centipede lies curled, afraid of my shadow.
Today, i see furrows in the soil, and I think of farther:
His wide squat hands, his brown and pock-marked face.
His forearms caked in dirt; his body damp with sun.
I see him pouring mulch on the flower bed.
I wonder to which place he has been stolen.
I drop to my knees and sift through the grass.
I ask the fly, the spider and the termite. They ignore me; 
they avoid all use of the vernacular. They carry on, amused.
By my foot, a cicada emerges from some deeper womb.
It sits still, marking each minute with a scream.
I had seen father let the cicadas perch on his back as he pruned; 
he was their instrument, their navigator. (He guided all his children.) 
' But I also saw his casket. I saw it ablaze in the incinerator.
I saw his body collapse to a grain of ash.
I know his life is larger than this.
I wonder where he has really gone.
Today,
the spiders stalk, lifting their lanky legs, setting them down again.
On the rock by the trellis, the praying mantis sits and mediates.
By my foot, the cicada shudders and charges away.
But because I am man, I must wonder.

My father sent me shimmying 
up the only persimmon tree, 
in Purdon while he gathered 
memories and pecans.
I found a limb far above my father, 
surveyed the dirt road, the boarded-up 
general store, the one-room school, 
and the fields of corn and cotton.
His fingers arched 
from point to point to point, 
pausing long enough for him to explain 
the bedroom where he had slept,
the living room where he had listened to Dick Tracy, and Little Orphan Annie 
the creek where he had played Tarzan after school 
the fields where he had picked pounds of cotton
the water-filled cellar where he had crouched when Tornadoes threatened, 
and the tree that he had planted with his father on the day he joined 
the Air Force.
I imagine him twenty years ago,
selling this land,
his frame slender with concern,
the recession nibbling away at the bulk
he had gained in the Air Force,
and his cheeks tightened
as if he had bitten into an unripe persimmon.

The stained window built for her
In the cathedral of lovers
Was my heart purloined in white
Adorned in refractions bright
By Harry P. Watson III
A smile, yes, always a smile 
Was my heart returned awhile 
The look that sent kingdoms far 
Into whirl around my star
Horizon lifted its eye 
Sending through its sparkling lie 
To my creative passionate bent 
And my church light heaven sent
So I spent quite well my weeks 
Toiling away with flushed cheeks 
Spinning and running with joy 
The light rebuilt this boy
Sent out to fulfill my oath 
I foraged truth and luxury both 
All to present to my bride 
Whose face, aglow, could shake the tide
But imagine my surprise...
Slumber over, I arise 
To see my church bathed in broken glass 
And my bride a whorish, scoffing lass

As the end of the school year 
approaches once again, we re­
flect upon the events that 
made 1994-95 unique.

Campus reflects upon eventful year
really big hole — a hole repre­
senting the former Skibo, as con­
struction on the new University 
Center commenced. The absence 
of Skibo bound the incoming 
freshmen to gather for orienta­
tion under a big, muddy tent.
As the class of 1998 situated 
F themselves without a Skibo in 
which to congregate, most upper­
classmen quickly became used to 
its departure.
Several maj or issues rocked the 
CMU community this year. One 
controversy that rallied the cam­
pus to action concerned free 
speech and the censorship of sexu­
ally explicit bboards.
In response to the 
administration’s resolution to 
eliminate pornographic bboards 
from the Carnegie Mellon sys­
tem, members of the campus com­
munity assembled in front of 
Warner Hall on November 9, 
1994.
The rally, lasting an hour and 
15 minutes, included featured 
speakers and elicited national 
press coverage in Time maga­
zine.
Former student body president 
Declan McCullagh, charging the 
administration with violation of 
free speech, claimed that the re­
moval of the bboards would hinder 
“legitimate education” on topics 
such as safe sex and abstinence.
Meanwhile, as publicity for the 
LO.J. Simpson trial blasted into 
fche strato- sphere,
CMU nursed its own scandal in­
volving domestic violence.
McCullagh allegedly pushed 
Donna Riley, a graduate student 
in Engineering and Public Policy, 
down a flight of stairs during an 
argument, causing injury to both 
of her arms and her face.
As the events unfolded, Crys­
tal Trexel, a ’94 graduate of in­
dustrial management, also 
charged McCullagh with domes­
tic abuse.
These developments spurred a 
campus controversy which even­
tually led to McCullagh’s resig­
nation on February 17,1995. Also 
affecting this outcome were accu­
sations of financial misconduct 
on the part of the former presi­
dent.
Nevertheless, the repercus­
sions of this case were not wholly 
negative: “At least now I know 
who they are [the student gov­
ernment],” said Poorvi Shah, 
freshman biology and economics 
major.
1995 was also marked by the 
biannual Beaux Arts Ball, though 
its potential as a major CMU 
event went largely unrealized.
Most claimed that the ball’s 
theme, “The Inner Apple: An 
Epicurean Ecstasy Exposed,” was 
misleading, and that any type (or 
spelling) of ecstasy was experi­
enced by only few and far be­
tween.
Considering the bloated ticket 
prices of thè event, patrons were 
justified in their dissatisfaction, 
feeling that they did not get their 
$25 worth. Or maybe it was just 
the lack of the much-anticipated 
alcohol.
The Naval Building became a 
new home to the student organi­
zations this year, as construction 
on Skibo continued.
Students, in addition, were, 
obliged to wean themselves off of 
Vean Wok, as bad ventilation
forced the popular Chinese food 
stand from its traditional 
quarters.

Campus community 
stunned by deaths
By SHIRA FELDMAN 
& S. VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Staffwriters
Tragedy struck the CMU 
campus several times as the 
community mourned the 
loss of four of its students 
during the course of the 
year.
The sudden death of Jus­
tin Chambers, sophomore 
material science and engi­
neering student and brother 
of Pi Lambda Phi, occurred 
on Sunday, December 11, 
due to alcohol poisoning.
PiLam was evicted from 
its house as the result of 
Chambers’ death, although 
its charter was still kept 
intact. The vacated house 
will serve as home to Sigma 
Tau Gamma for the upcom­
ing year.
Another tragic loss suf­
fered by the community was 
the untimely death of Drew 
Ross, who died on October 
21 of an apparent suicide, 
senior computer science ma­
jor Ross was a design mi­
nor, a chair of the Activiies 
Boards concert, and a 
brother of Delta Tau Delta.
Joseph Gordon, a fresh-
man in H&SS, died of 
meningococcemia, a bacte­
rial form of meningitis, on 
September 30, 1994, after 
collapsing in his room 
around midnight.
The 17-year-old Gordon 
was a member of Spirit, 
CMAP, and the men’s soc­
cer team.
Devastation erupted on 
campus once again with the 
brutal murder of Javon 
Thompson, a freshman art 
major, on December 20.
Thompson was fatally 
shot in the chest and stom­
ach by a gang member while 
playing video games at a 
friend’s house.
Involved in the Carnegie 
Mellon Action Project, the
dent Center, just in time for the 
Chinese New Year, the Year of 
the Boar. (We can only hope, how­
ever, that Wok-n-Roll doesn’t 
serve General Tso’s Boar.)
In the “Things Falling Over” 
category, a physical plant van 
tumble d down a hill by the Physi­
cal Plant building this year.
The incident occurred as a red 
mule obstructed the driver’s view, 
causing him to fall down the hill. 
Along those same lines, Alpha 
Epsilon Pi’s booth collapsed dur­
ing Midway construction of this 
year’s Spring Carnival.
Three members of the frater­
nity were injured while trying to 
install the roof of the booth.
Meanwhile, the 6 o’clock news, 
having been informed that a 
“structure” collapsed, and believ­
ing it was a building, arrived to 
cover this mishap thoroughly.
Another disturbing occurrence 
transpired when two seniors de­
cided to shoot a BB gun out of 
their apartment window on 
Negley Avenue, hittingl2 people.
The students were arrested, 
and were charged with five counts 
of aggravated assault, five counts 
of reckless endangerment, and 
criminal conspiracy, according to 
The Tartan on November 24, 
1994.
This year's Sweepstakes com­
petition saw the Spirit women’s 
A team break their own record 
while the PiKA men defended 
their title. Yet the major victory 
was the newly developed conge­
nial attitude that pervaded the 
Awards ceremony.
The annual Greek Sing extrava­
ganza went off with a bang at the 
Soldiers and Sailor’s Memorial 
Hall this past March.
As the Greeks entertained us 
with 11 minute skits that mim­
icked bits and pieces of popular 
productions, they raised money 
for Pittsburgh’s Make-a-Wish 
Foundation, which benefits un­
fortunate children in the commu­
nity.
Greek Sing is the Greek 
community’s major philanthropic 
event of the year.
soon-to- 
ther had 
to abandon the
through his rising 
at CMU.
The four deaths left a dark 
cloud over the campus and 
the remainder of the semes­
ter as we tried to compre­
hend such unnecessary 
grief amongst us.
As we look to the coming 
year, we hope that we have 
learned from all of our ex­
periences, both the good and 
the bad. Perhaps we will 
realize that we became 
stronger as a community 
after dealing with such 
widespread grief during the 
’94-’95 school year.
The Year in Review
May 1: President Robert Mehrablan puts his seal of approval on 
the last beam of the new University Center.
April 8: Sig Nu women’s team pushes buggy at Sweepstakes.
February 17: Student Body President Declan McCullagh resigns.
February 11: CMU students get down at Beaux Arts Ball.
November 9: The CMU community unites to protest Internet 
censorship.

Old Man Donner bids adieu with dessert extravaganza
Old Man Donner
by Jason Roth
As we enter the second half of the last 
decade of a tired century .... No, no, I’m 
sorry, that’s the wrong Farewell Ad­
dress.
Avoid foreign entanglement.... Sorry. 
One last go.
Although I am no Teddy Roosevelt, I 
am a man with a plan, and it is no 
coincidence that this, my final column, 
will be all about the way to end a meal.
We have a variety of recipes, from 
clever additions to packaged cake mixes 
to an American Classic, made from 
scratch with love.
Classic Chocolate Frosting
2 squares (2 oz.) Baker’s chocolate
1 cup confectioner’s sugar
4 Tb (1/2 stick) butter
1 Tb hot water
That’s right. We’re topping that 
Duncan Hines masterpiece with a little 
bit of home — icing from scratch. First, 
however, a word about words: specifi­
cally, about icing and frosting, and 
whether there’s a difference.
Although a world authority on food, 
Old Man Dormer is no food snob, espe­
cially when it comes to baking, as Old 
Man Donner’s Mom did not bake. So, is 
there a difference between “icing” and 
“frosting”? Perhaps, but who cares?
Getting back to covering your cake, 
start by melting the chocolate and but­
ter separately; as in, use a saucepan for 
the butter and a microwave (low heat!) 
for the chocolate; careful not to bum the 
chocolate, or it grows grainy.
Anyway, combine the chocolate and 
butter, and mix in the sugar, stirring 
over low heat the entire time; you may 
want a whisk for this.
Although it seems like an enormous 
amount of sugar, it will all mix in and 
become a velvety-smooth mixture. Add 
just a touch of water to put a glaze on, 
and then spread over your oven-fresh 
yummy.
Obviously, this is best fresh, but, if 
covered well, it will remain simulta­
neously richer and lighter than any of 
those canisters of sludge Betty Crocker 
would have you ingest. Oy.
Pineapple-Upside-Down Cake
Generic Yellow Cake mix (and its in­
gredients)
regular can of crushed or sliced pine­
apple (your call) 
butter 
brown sugar 
maraschino cherries
Melt plenty o’ butter and coat the 
bottom of a lasagna pan with it; sprinkle 
on brown sugar until you’ve got a serious 
layer of the stuff (no clear spots, but 
don’t go crazy — if you can hide a party 
favor in the brown sugar, you’ve gone too 
far).
Here comes an essential point—when 
you drain the pineapples, save the juice. 
Again, cover the bottom of the pan with 
the pineapple (party tip — for next sum­
mer, why not add food coloring to your 
slices and make an Olympic flag on your 
cake?).
Now, mix up the cake, replacing the 
water with the juice (OK, some of you 
already figured that out, but just wipe 
those smug little grins off your faces; I 
write not for those who can cook, but for
those who need guidance. I assure you, 
there is more joy in my kitchen over one 
dorm resident who skips Ragu and makes 
his own than over 99 gourmets).
Obviously, if there’s not enough juice, 
fill ‘er up with ol’ ethyl. Anyway, make 
the mix, pour it in the pan, and bake as 
you normally would.
Here’s the key to the whole schmeer — 
you have to flip it while it’s still hot (!). 
Why? So that all that butter and juice 
seeps down into the cake and makes 
everything wonderful.
How to flip? Well, you’ve got to guess 
based on what’s on hand; theoretically 
you could make a big circle and just slap 
it down on the counter, but that’s a bit 
risky.
Whatever you choose, good luck and 
Godspeed.
The donor of this recipe, by the way, 
insists the cherries are vital, but no one 
ever proved the causal relationship be­
tween the cherry-less cake and that guy 
who died in Zelienople. Your call.
Choco-Mocha Frosting
2 cups whipped cream
8 oz. hot fudge sauce (like you’d buy in 
the store)
1 Tb Folger’s coffee (maybe other stuff 
would, work?)
Do you know how to make real whipped 
cream? Well, let me tell you, it’s pretty 
simple. Chill a big bowl in the freezer, 
then get some heavy/whipping cream, 
pour it in the bowl, add some 
confectioner’s sugar, and mix it until 
thick.
As many of you no doubt know, if you 
mix too long you get butter, so pay atten­
tion. For this recipe you want a fairly 
stiff mixture.
Heat the fudge and dissolve in the 
coffee until it’s smooth again and the 
whole kitchen smells wonderful (I hate 
coffee and I love this).
Wait for the fudge to cool down quite a 
bit, then fold in half the whipped cream 
(as in, don’t mix it like sugar in tea, but 
combine them so that they’re close be­
side one another).
This is what you use between the lay­
ers of your cake (did I mention the choco­
late cake? Make a chocolate layer cake 
to go with this).
You shouldn’t use all of it; now fold in 
the remaining whipped cream, so you 
have a lighter frosting for the rest of the 
cake.
This cake gets very tall and is very 
rich, but is soooo good. Man! This was 
my first real foray into the world of 
(slightly) different desserts, and it’s a 
good one.
Strawberry Shortcake
2 cups flour
1/4 cup sugar
1 Tb baking powder
4 Tb (1/2 stick) butter
Strawberries
This is my main dessert; what I love 
about it is that it’s a pleasant thing to do
— it takes less than an hour, start to 
finish, and rewards you with this won­
derful thing that is very versatile.
More on this later.
Start by mushing together the first 
four ingredients, cutting in the butter 
(adding it in a bit at a time), so you get 
smallish, flour-coated crumbs.
When you’re done you should have a 
fairly sticky dough; turn it onto a counter 
and knead until even, but not forever.
From here you have two choices: big 
shortcake or little shortcakes; either cut 
the dough and then bake, or put it in a 
cake pan and bake; regardless, we’re 
looking at 450 for about 10 minutes, or 
until the top goes golden brown. See how 
easy?
Now here’s where you have options. 
Do you have strawberries? Yes? Then
you can cut those up as you see fit, mafc 
some whipped cream, split th< 
shortbread in half (horizontally — it’; 
easy), and layer away; that’s your classic 
strawberry shortcake (works with othei 
fruits too, of course).
A cream-free option is to crumble tty 
cake, cut the berries, add the berrie; 
sprinkle sugar, and mix together sue) 
that the crumbs coat the berries.
Yum. Or, again, split your cake, slice 
your berries, and pour on heavy cream, 
unwipped (I just dreamt that word). 
Yow.
Finally, here’s the winter option 
double the sugar in the original recipe. 
Cut the dough in about 10 pieces; bakfc. 
Now, while piping hot, split them, melt 
some butter inside (like a biscuit), an! 
sprinkle in sugar and cinnamon — don't 
be shy.
And, for the coupe de grace (literally, 
cup of grace, a kind of French sewage 
product), dab just a touch of butter on 
top and sprinkle on more sugar for tha 
semi-glazed effect.
This is so good with mulled cider that 
it makes me wish it were winter again.
There are many other places to go (life 
butter mixed with cinnamon, and putin 
a depression at the center of each little 
cake); it’s such a simple recipe that yon 
should feel free to experiment.
And there you go.
I sure hope you’ve learned something 
from this column, if only that Kathie Lee 
is even more evil than one might sul- 
mise from her show.
Happy Moto ... urn, I bid you pea ... 
wait, I’ve got it:

Out Where?
by Eric Salzman
I have been to Kangaroo Island 
(off the coast of Adeleide) to see 
the ’roos and koalas. I have been 
to Tasmania to see the devils.
It took me a few months, but I 
finally got to see all of those ani­
mals for which Australia is fa­
mous.
Do you know what these ani­
mals do? They sleep. They sleep 
all day long.
They’re all nocturnal. What a 
disappointing experience it is to
fly halfway around the world to 
see a koala scratch its leg once 
every couple of hours.
Koalas, for all their cuteness 
and appeal, are very unfriendly, 
stressed creatures, but that is 
not the only way they resemble 
CMU students.
They also, like all of you, are 
not bears. They are marsupials, 
and believe me, if you are in Aus­
tralia, you had better know it.
While Warner Brothers pre­
sents an entertaining image of 
the Tasmanian devil, the crea­
tures actually keep their slobber­
ing to a minimum.
They are very cute, puppy-like 
animals. The only twirling I got 
to see them do was when they 
rolled over in their sleep.
And the kangaroos — these 
things are giant rats! The ones I 
met were friendly enough, though
they’ll steal your wallet if you 
give them the chance.
Still, when they do that hop­
ping thing that makes me think 
they belong at a Green Day con­
cert, they look like cheese-grov-
streets of Launceston, Tasmania, 
where I was accosted by a group 
of school girls wanting to know if 
I knew Keanu Reeves and what 
happens on upcoming episodes of 
Models, Inc.
And the kangaroos - these things are 
giant rats! The ones I met were friendly 
enough, though they’ll steal your wal­
let if you give them the chance.
eling, dirt-loving, ear-twitching, 
scampy overgrown rats!
Of course, not all of the wild 
animals in Australia travel on 
four legs.
Many of the two-legged crazed 
creatures can be found in the 
pubs, or apparently out on the
When I explained that I don’t 
watch Models, Inc., and that 
Keanu Reeves is not in the habit 
of frequenting Pittsburgh college 
campuses, they sadly moved on 
to other, less important subjects.
Subjects like—well, then, does 
Dylan get his money back?
This one I knew the answer to, 
but I didn’t have the heart to ruin 
it for them.
What about music?
We like Bon Jovi — they told 
me. At this point I had a little 
trouble standing; however, they 
soon added the names Nirvana 
and Pearl Jam (Green Day has 
yet to infiltrate mainstream Tas­
mania). Ooh — and Silverchair, 
we like them.
I had to have them explain that 
Silverchair is actually an Aus­
tralian band.
It is, in fact, the biggest band in 
the country these days, and its 
members are only 16.
Hmmm, at the age of 161 could 
... make spaghetti?
But enough about me.
Most of you are probably just 
about recovered from that Carni­
val hangover and are looking for­
ward to summer break.
I wish you luck on finals. Mine 
aren’t for a few weeks yet, so for 
now, the beach beckons.
Yup, it’s been a rough semes­
ter all right. But don’t worry about 
me — somehow I’ll manage.
Peace.
Eric Salzman is combing the land

he hopes that his friends are eat­

darn ‘roos steals his plane along

Net personality debates 
bboard censorship issue
Focused on the Internet
by Kenton Shaver
Recently, I talked to an alt.sex per­
sonality named Tanith who identified 
herself as a 19-year-old sophomore 
studying at a prestigious and expen­
sive university much like our own. 
She told me by way of further back­
ground that she is of mixed race and 
basically heterosexual.
,1 To familiarize her with our section,
| I gave her the WWW URL of the CMU 
: Censorship page. These are continued 
: excerpts from my interview with 
Tanith. The full text of the article is on 
. the WWW. Finger me for the location 
. to point your WWW browser. •
Do you think that some subjects 
should not be discussed and it sets 
a bad example to discuss them?
TANITH: Whoa! Talking sets a bad 
example? Then you shouldn’t talk 
about crime; you might encourage it.
, Don’t discuss the Holocaust; don’t want 
: it to happen again.
Also, I think ignorance causes a lot 
of problems. I recently researched 
BDSM for a paper. Many people con­
sider BDSM a violent, abusive, hor­
rible thing. However, in talking to
- people I realized that most people are 
. in healthy relationships and what they 
are doing is not horrible. Ignorance 
: causes more damage than anything I 
: can think of. Someone who is a 
i pedophile is one, regardless of whether 
he has read about it.
I want to continue to play the 
devil’s advocate in our discussion. 
Do you believe that what one has 
the power to express dictates what 
one does and thinks?
TANITH: Do you mean what I write 
. dictates what I do and think? No. I’ll 
go back to BDSM as an example. BDSM
has as part of its creed “safe, sane and 
consensual.” However, some BDSM 
porn has women who don’t consent. 
Why? Because it’s exciting to fanta­
size about.
However, these people would never 
actually do it in reality. Fantasy and 
reality are quite different. I may dream. 
about being six feet tall, but I’m never 
going to be that. This is not to say that 
if I post, for example, death threats, 
that something shouldn’t be done. Or 
sexually harass someone through 
email. I’ve gottenlots ofwannas [propo­
sitions], because I’m female and on the 
net. I get them from non-sex groups. 
Ahhh!
We have found the line, I think.
TANITH: What line?
The line between acceptable and 
unacceptable forms of personal 
expression.
TANITH: Ah, well it’s when some­
thing goes from discussion to solicita­
tion. I don’t mind discussing sexual 
issues. I do not want to be their sex 
kitten or a free porn generator. This is 
an extreme example you give, but what 
in your view constitutes net harass­
ment? Also, wannas are lame and an­
noying. If someone wannas me, I tell 
them I don’t wanna fuck, that I have a 
SO and to go away. This gets rid of 
most of them. Sexual harassment is 
when they won’t stop. When they start 
getting harassed is a case by case 
basis.
For instance, I’ve had a wanna turn 
into a friend. I’ve also had a case where
I helped someone and he was crazy. 
That crazy man got mad when I didn’t 
wanna fuck him. He started sending 
me several messages a day that were 
violent, personal and scary. He asked 
if I wanted to be doused with gasoline 
and set on fire. He kept on going. His 
post master wouldn’t do anything. I 
got a student there to file sexual ha­
rassment charges on my behalf.

May 5 “Fiesta de Primavera” to unite 
CMU campus community with free fun
By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Staffwriter
Have any of you glanced at your calen­
dars lately?
Go ahead, put that Advanced Calcu­
lus book down and check it out. The final 
week of classes is here!
On Friday, May 5, a number of organi­
zations are holding a huge party called 
the Fiesta de Primavera.
The event is a celebration of the last 
day of classes.
But wait, there’s more — the party 
and all it has to offer is free! Free as in
you don’t need a penny to attend!
Spring Carnival again? Not quite. The 
party begins at 3 pm and will utilize the 
entire Cut and Mall.
From 3 pm until 7 pm you can partici­
pate in Air Volley Ball and a Ball Crawl; 
you can also ride on Gravitron.
From 4 until 8 pm experience the thrill 
of Human Velcro. At 5 pm you and your 
pals can dance to the tunes of D J Luv.
By this time, you’re most likely going 
to be hungry, but there is no need to 
worry I assure you. Your days of college 
malnourishment will be over, at least
for a day. From 5:30 until 7 pm you can 
take advantage of a real live Barbecue 
and eat until you can eat no more. The 
food is free!
At 6 pm the Frampton Brothers will be 
performing. From 6 until 8 pm you can 
visit Casandra, who will dazzle you with 
her palm and Tarot card readings.
You can also be entertained be a num­
ber of wandering magicians, and you 
will have the opportunity to hop in a hot 
air balloon. The balloon will transport 
you to a higher dimension where the 
view of Pittsburgh is magnificent.
At 7:15 pm DJ Luv will be spinning 
some records 
again, and finally 
beginning at 8:30 
pm AB Movies will 
present Star Trek
- Generations and 
a repeat run of Pulp 
Fiction. And to 
think, all of this is 
for you.
Well, it’s not only 
for you. The party 
is open to all stu­
dents, faculty, 
staff, and family. 
But just think of 
how many people 
you’ll get to meet!
The event is be­
ing sponsored by a 
multitude of orga­
nizations including 
Student Activities, 
Student Affairs, 
Student Dormitory 
Council, AB Tech, 
AB Special Events, 
AB Movies, and the 
Alice Mensch/Tartan Artist Diversity Council. 
The groups have joined with the sole 
purpose of bringing the campus together 
in a relaxed environment.
Natalie Wochele, a freshman H&SS 
student who is helping to organize the 
event, said, “This party was not orga­
nized by only one group. A variety of 
people have contributed the ideas for 
this event to be possible. We thought a 
party would be a great way to end the 
school year. Plus, it will bring everyone 
together in a harmonious way.”
But, Wochele feels another important 
aspect of the party is that it will be a
l+CCHO.
tension reliever.
She said, “We are always so stressed 
out at this school. We are constantly 
working like machines. We deserve’to 
get to see people. We deserve a break!” 
Brian Curfman, a sophomore biology 
and psychology major who is the Special 
Developmental Issues intern in the Of­
fice of Student Affairs and one of the 
facilitators of the festival, feels the party 
will boost overall happiness on campus.
He said, “One of the underlying rea­
sons of the Fiesta de Primavera is to 
increase student happiness. Students 
tend to be the happiest during Carnival. 
The more big events that people have 
the chance to interact with each other 
the happier they they’ll be.”
Curfman also believes that students 
need a chance to relieve stress and to 
meet each other. “Students need the 
opportunity to relax after a stressful 
semester before they plunge into finals. 
This event will hopefully bring students 
out of the academic buildings and dorms 
and into each other’s lives, even if only 
for a night.”
The committee, which consists of ap­
proximately 12 students, feels certain 
that a large percentage of students will 
attend the event.
Lee Abernathy, chairman of AB Spe­
cial Events, said, “If people don’t go, 
they’re stupid! A lot of this stuff is being 
paid for by the activities fee. You might 
as well get your money’s worth. Many of 
the events were planned with students 
in mind. This is for the students.”
Anne Witchner from Student Activi­
ties also feels that is would be in the 
student body’s best interest to attend.
She said, “I think that students will 
enjoy this event. There is a lot to do and 
much to choose from. Students will not 
have to go too far out of their way to 
participate. I am anticipating a strong 
attendance. The students who have put 
this together have worked hard. The 
events are strong with a wide range of 
appeal. With the location, it will be hard 
to walk by without noticing that some­
thing is going on.”
In the case of inclement weather, the 
location and availability of events may 
change. Please check the posters in the 
Student Center and Doherty Hall for 
further details.
Administration and students differ on bulletin board censorship issue
,3-.By ALLEE KING
.jiTartan Staffwriter
r ''.K A few months ago, a rally was 
r* organized on campus around the 
decision made by the administra-
- tion to ban certain material on 
¿the bboards.
Since then, the administration
¿jhas been working on a proposal 
m that will spell out the logistics for 
¡^deciding what is or is not appro­
priate to have on the system.
_ A bboard committee was set up 
to mediate between the adminis­
tration, legal consultants and stu­
dents, and there was an open- 
forum meeting earlier in April at 
which the committee presented 
the administration’s proposal-in- 
process.
At the meeting, the Coalition 
for Academic Freedom of Expres­
sion (CAFE) presented a counter­
proposal that was aimed at pre­
venting the administration from 
carrying out their intention to 
censor what can be mounted on 
the Andrew system.
The administration drew up 
this proposal in reaction to what 
they feel to be a legal threat if it 
continues to have certain mate­
rial on the system which may 
violate the law, as well as the 
rights of those individuals that 
explicit or inappropriate mate­
rial may offend.
In the preamble of the proposed 
policy, the explanation reads: 
“Locally mounting data from ex­
ternal sources necessarily in­
volves making some judgments 
about allocation of local comput­
ing resources and overt decisions 
about selection of data to be 
mounted. In undertaking this 
work, the University exercises 
diligence to honor legal rights of 
others and legal obligations which 
it has. For instance, when mount­
ing licensed material, the univer­
sity honors the intellectual prop­
erty owners with proper licens­
ing and payment and by limiting 
access to members of the commu­
nity. Similarly, the university 
avoids carrying data which vio­
lates Federal and Pennsylvania 
law, such as obscenity.”
Under this new policy, all ma­
terial that is posted to the system 
will be evaluated, and a decision 
will be made according to the 
characteristics of the policy 
whether or not it is material that 
“conform[s] to the laws govern­
ing electronic information trans­
mission.”
The scope of the policy will af­
fect all computer resources owned 
and operated by the University, 
which includes services provided 
on the Andrew system, ECE, SCS, 
PSC, and SEI.
As the rally earlier in the year 
demonstrated, many members of 
the campus are against this 
policy, and in a larger sense, the 
concept of censorship in general.
In this light, CAFE wrote their 
counter-proposal based on the 
idea that censorship of the mate­
rial on the net is what violates 
individual rights, and not the 
material itself.
In their counter-proposal, they 
made it clear that the policy the 
administration wishes to enforce 
would give the administration the 
power to deny access of material 
that they as individuals may find 
explicit and obscene, but that the 
community has a right to by the 
First Amendment.
One of the policy clause states: 
“As such, the university may 
choose not to participate in, or 
facilitate the participation of oth­
ers in, activities that are deemed 
inconsistent with the university’s 
mission.”
CAFE counter-proposed that 
the policy states: “By analogy with 
the campus telephone network, 
Carnegie Mellon University will 
not limit the freedom ofindividual 
members of the community to 
use university operated equip­
ment, networks, or infrastruc­
tures to engage in lawful activi­
ties merely because those activi­
ties are of a type in which the 
majority of the university com­
munity would choose not to en-
Florence Taitel, a freshman 
chemical engineeringmajor, has 
followed the movements of this 
proposal, and has been very in­
volved in the counter-action that 
CAFE and other individuals on 
campus have been forming.
She feels that the action that 
the administration is taking is 
not necessary.
policy. “They have hooked in on 
feminist rhetoric to make it seem 
like they are protecting and work­
ing for betterment.”
Erwin Steinberg, vice provost 
for education, and head of the 
bboard committee, was asked 
about the committee’s stance on 
women’s issues: “I don’t think 
that we’re trying to prevent or 
promote violence against anyone. 
We’re just trying not to violate 
the Pennsylavia law.”
Material such as pornography
“It is highly unlikely that the 
university would actually be sued 
on the grounds of allowing “ob­
scene” material on the system. In 
fact, the odds are infinite­
simal,’’she said.
In addition, Taitel commented 
that a large part of those who are 
reacting against the admi­
nistration’s steps are the femi­
nists, who feel that the adminis­
tration is wrongfully using the 
conceptual protection of female 
rights to instill a repressing
Francine Gemperle/Tartan Art Coeditor
and erotica has been classified as 
offensive, obscene and endanger­
ing to women, and the banning 
thus far on the Net of 
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica and 
ail its derivative branches,-for 
example, was among the efforts 
by the administration to remove 
such material.
Taitel and other CAFE mem­
bers feel that eradicating the 
material from the system is not 
only a violation of the first amend­
ment, but a completely misdi­
rected attack on problems in the 
community.
“On so many levels it is absurd. 
What they are calling ‘safety’ is 
what is preventing a wider per­
spective. Being exposed to naked 
bodies and sexual texts is not 
what corrupts people’s minds. I 
was exposed to Playboy when I 
was four, and I think I have be­
come a well-rounded and produc­
tive person. Preventing people 
from having the access to this 
kind of material is not going to 
fight violence or rape ... the [ad­
ministration! is only fighting to 
make statements rather than to 
make changes.”
A lot of members of the commu­
nity also feel that on-line censor­
ship infringes their rights and is 
an unproductive action, although 
they have not been following the 
making of the policy.
“I only wish that the adminis­
tration would spend more time 
focusing on the fact that there is 
a lack of cultural integration and 
focus at this university instead of 
preventing communication in 
such repressing ways,” said 
Perrin Rowland, a freshman En­
glish major.
Taitel said, “The potential for 
communication here is being held 
back by moral dogma ... it is very 
unfortunate because CMU is set­
ting a precedent that a lot of other 
schools will follow.”
Between the two opposing 
sides, the administration says 
this is for both the protection of 
personal rights and legal pur­
poses.
They claim that the outcome of 
the situation is indeterminable 
at this point in time.
Steinberg said, “We’re not pre­
venting CMU students from hav­
ing access. We’re not storing it 
[the various bboards on the 
internet that contain informa­
tion that is considered porno­
graphic] on our servers, but ev­
eryone still has access to it on the 
internet.”
He stated that the administra­
tion is walking a very thin line 
between Pennsylvania law, which 
defines obsenities, and individual 
freedom/rights.
Steinberg explained that Penn­
sylvania law is based on a Su­
preme Court decision which stipu­
lates how laws should be framed.
He said that the bboard censor­
ship committee is trying to pre­
vent the school from being sued, 
not obstruct personal liberties.
Steinberg said, “We’re not pre­
venting anyone from publishing 
this material, and we’re not pre­
venting anyone from accessing 
it. Anyone who has taken CSW 
can understand the instructions 
for accessing the internet and get 
this material.”
Steinberg also stated that there 
is no way to get around defining 
what’s appropriate and inappro­
priate in this situation: “Some­
body has to make distinctions. 
How can you make decisions with­
out making distinctions? We [the 
bboard censorship committee] 
saw one picture of a zebra having 
intercourse with a woman. I don’t 
think that anyone would disagree 
that this violated the Pennsylva­
nia law.”
Taitel commented that when 
questioned about the policy, mem­
bers of the committee were un­
willing to directly respond to 
many of the criticisms and 
counter proposals made by CAFE. 
“They said that many of the points 
of the policy were still ‘up in the 
air,’ and yet they indicated that 
this was the last time we would 
be able to discuss it with them 
before everything was set.”
She feels that because of this, 
the administration benefits if the 
students will not be included in 
the final outcome.
Taitel said, “The administra­
tion’s actions are not oriented 
towards the students, but towards 
pleasing the parents and run­
ning this University like a corpo­
ration and not a school.”

Women unite against violence in D.C.
Cracking the Myth
by Suzanne Paddock 
& Amber Benezra 
—
On Sunday, April 9, while the CMU 
‘community was immersed in Carnival 
activities, hundreds of thousands of 
people rallied together in Washing­
ton, D.C., to stop violence against 
women. We were among the 250,000 
who attended the National Organiza­
tion for Women’s March for Women’s 
ives.
Beginning at noon, under a banner 
proclaiming, “We won’t go back,” end­
less lines of buses arrived from all over 
the country, dropping people off from 
as far away as Maine and Colorado. As 
thousands of men and women filtered 
down from the Washington Monument 
to the stage set up in front of the 
Capitol, we were struck by the magni­
tude of the rally.
Various speakers and bands ad­
dressed the critical issues American 
women are facing, encouraging us to 
stand in solidarity to: “Decry heart­
less plans at the national level for 
orphanages and other punitive mea­
sures in the guise of reforms that hurt 
women and their children, demand 
better enforcement of laws covering 
domestic violence, rape, and sexual 
harassment, denounce the continuing 
and escalating anti-abortion violence 
at women’s health centers, call for
protection of our health centers and shirts portray women who were at- 
stricter enforcement of existing laws in- tacked or abused because of their 
eluding the Freedom to Access Clinics sexual preference.
Entrance Act (FACE).” The Project was originally based on
One of the most powerful speakers of the Vietnam Memorial, which lists 
the day to us was Rev. Jesse Jackson. He the names of the 39,000 American 
reminded us that April 9 was the day 
Martin Luther King, Jr. was buried.
In a moment of reflection, Jackson 
asked everyone to join hands and re­
member. He proceeded to speak about 
King and his pursuits of equality for all 
people.
Jackson showed how feminism crosses 
the lines of gender equality as well as 
racial justice by stressing “the 
inextricableness” of the two issues.
Various speakers from all backgrounds 
showed the variety of feminist objec­
tives, and Jackson showed the related­
ness of all the issues, which helped to 
unify everyone at the rally.
Sponsored by groups such as: Appala­
chian Women’s Alliance, Rainbow Coa­
lition, United Farm Workers, Bigala, 
and NAJRAL, speakers addressed how 
women confront various forms of vio­
lence through welfare reduction, abor­
tion clinic terrorism, racial prejudice, 
domestic abuse, and discrimination 
against gays, lesbians, and bisexuals.
Another main focal point of the rally 
was the Clothesline Project, which was 
displayed across the National Mall.
Created to memorialize victims and 
survivors of violence, the Clothesline 
Project is made up of different colored t- 
shirts, decorated by or in memory of 
individuals who have experienced abuse.
White shirts symbolize women who 
have been killed by their abusers, tan/ will be enough to motivate people out

soldiers that died in the Vietnam War. 
Tragically, in the war against women, 
36,000 women are killed each year by 
husbands and lovers.
The Clothesline made it possible to 
see the secret pain, recovery, and em­
powerment of the thousands of women 
that encounter violence in this coun­
try.
The shirts were veiy personalized 
and moving—decorated with photos, 
drawings, and poems.
The intensity of the day was over­
whelming, and the emotions we felt 
traveled with us back to Pittsburgh. 
After being thrown back into the CMU 
lifestyle of endless nights in the clus­
ter and an infinite amount of work to 
do, it seems strange to believe that 
such an event as the NOW rally oc­
curred.
But the reality of it all is that we are 
not going to be at CMU forever, and 
one day hopefully our priorities will 
exceed academic and material suc­
cess. Other issues such as those we 
rallied for in Washington, D.C., will 
hopefully take prevalence in our lives 
so that such rallies are not necessary 
to stir people’s emotions and make 
them aware of the many problems 
people face.
Hopefully, the reality that things 
like violence against women still, exist
CMU increases efforts at 
harassment prevention
By TRICIA DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
In response to an article printed in 
February by The Tartan titled, “Facili­
ties Management harassment worries 
campus community,” [2/13/94], Dean of 
H&SS Peter Stearns, Head of English 
Department David Kaufer, Assistant 
Vice President for Human Resources at 
CMU Barbara Smith, Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael Murphy, and Director of 
Facilities Operations and Utilities Mar­
tin Altschul, have all expressed interest 
in increasing sexual harassment aware­
ness and prevention at CMU.
The administration has recently been 
concerned with preventing sexual ha­
rassment. In September, the University 
sent a policy with a cover letter from 
President Mehrabian and a pamphlet 
titled: “Sexual Harassment: A Commu­
nity Concern” to all faculty, staff, and 
students.
A Sexual Harassment Advisory Panel 
has existed at CMU, even before the 
article about sexual harassment on cam­
pus was printed. Smith has also made 
several administrative changes to ex­
pand sexual harassment awareness and 
prevention.
As numerous women came forward 
claiming harassment by a few Facilities 
Management Workers on campus, the 
University’s efforts at sexual harass­
ment education have increased. Al­
though this problem is not widespread, 
the fear of a few students sparked imme­
diate concern by the administration.
Smith said, “The Panel of Sexual Ha­
rassment Advisors was expanded and 
trained. The panel members meet on a 
quarterly basis to identify broad issues
and identify strategies to enhance cam­
pus awareness. We have completed 
awareness sessions for all staff supervi­
sors, approximately 450 supervisors, in- 
cludingthose in Facilities Management.”
“The sessions ran approximately three 
hours and covered the definition of ha­
rassment, the University policy and the 
law, the issue of intent versus impact 
and sexual harassment as an issue of 
power. Supervisory sessions include^, 
video and several case studies,” she said.
“We have also been presenting aware­
ness sessions for faculty in a number of 
departments and will continue to do so. 
These sessions run approximately an 
hour and focus on defining sexual ha­
rassment and the impact it has in an 
academic environment that is welcom­
ing to female students where mentoring 
relationships develop and the contribu­
tions of female students can be fully 
realized,” she added.
Although the supervisors of the Facili­
ties Management Workers have at­
tended sexual harassment sessions, the 
employees as a whole have not yet at­
tended sessions. According to Smith, a 
sexual harassment course is currently 
being planned for the Facilities Man­
agement Workers.
Smith said, “We have a program for 
building staff awareness which uses a 
different video, describes the University 
policy, support mechanisms such as the 
Panel of Sexual Harassment Advisors, 
and the grievance procedure. Cases are 
also used. This is the program that will 
be presented in Facilities.”
Smith is also collaborating with col­
leges to develop awareness sessions for 
graduate and undergraduate Teaching 
Assistants.
Student perceptions of Career Center change as office expands focus
By MICHELLE HALL
Tartan Staffwriter
The 1994 - 95 school year has 
been busy for the Career Center. 
In addition to the services they 
have always provided for students 
at CMU, the directors, counse­
lors, and assistants have spent 
(he past eight months research­
ing, planning, and launching new 
programs, several specifically for 
students in the Humanities and 
Fine Arts.
Leslie Kay, a junior double 
major in creative and professional 
writing, said, “Considering the 
quality of a CMU education, you 
would think the Career Center 
would be better equipped to pro­
vide graduates in the Humani­
ties with opportunities for em­
ployment suitable to their level 
of education. I think that the no­
tion that employers will not ac­
tively seek out graduates in the 
Humanities is simply absurd.”
This sentiment, held by many 
Humanities students, has been 
on the minds of Career Center 
administrators and is being ad­
dressed through outreach pro­
grams begun this past fall. John 
Michalenko, associate director of 
the Career Center, said, “Last 
summer we did a marketing 
search of companies who employ 
Humanities students and asked 
them to recruit on campus or pro­
vide us with job vacancies for our 
newsletters. This effort resulted 
in 90 new employers recruiting 
on campus and hundreds of job 
vacancies.”In addition to attract­
ing more employers, the Career 
Center has initiated local out­
reach through the Placement As­
sistant Program. This program 
involved contacting Humanities 
and Fine Arts departments to not 
only increase awareness of the 
resources available to their stu­
dents, but also to gather input as 
to what services are still needed.
Frank Jeffrey Sauri, one of two 
H&SS placement assistants at 
the Career Center, said: “Instead 
of trying to do one big thing that 
would help everyone a little bit, 
the Placement Assistant Program
reference sheets detailing the 
books in the Career Center li­
brary pertinent to each major, 
and reference sheets about 
resumes, interviews, and finding 
graduate schools, among other
allows us to customize smaller 
projects for each department and 
even major.”
Some of these projects include 
classroom visits to students in 
specific majors, bibliography-like
David Perry/ Tartan Photo Staff Manager 
things. These projects are appar­
ently only the beginning. De­
spite complaints from some of the 
campus community, there are 
students who have greatly ben­
efited from the services provided
by the Career Center. Andrew 
Weinstein, a senior computer sci­
ence major, made use of many of 
the resources which eventually 
resulted in a full-time job. “My 
interaction with the Career Cen­
ter has been very positive. The 
Resumé Express Kit, along with 
the cooperative Career Center 
employees, has proven to be very 
expeditious and well-organized,” 
he said.
In addition to on-campus re­
cruiting, Weinstein made use of 
the various reference materials 
on companies, resume advice and 
consulting, and the evaluations 
of plant-trip interviews.
With all of the new program­
ming and the continuance of pro­
grams instituted in previous 
years, the Career Center has had 
an exciting and successful year. 
“I think we’ve been really suc­
cessful in programming. Both 
graduate School Week in Sep­
tember and Career Week in Feb­
ruary were very successful. Our 
staff has increased, and we’ve 
been able to identify and pur­
chase additional resources for our 
library,” said Michalenko.
In addition to the new library 
resources, the Career Center 
brought in a computer program 
called “Discover,” intended to act 
as a career counseling tool. It has 
been a successful new endeavor.
“What I see our role as is edu­
cating and empowering the stu­
dents by sharing our resources so 
they can develop the skills to con­
duct their own searches. Those 
are the kinds of things you carry 
out of here and keep with you the 
rest of your life,” said Michalenko.
“You don’t have to be an engi­
neer to go to the Career Center. If 
you want help finding an intern­
ship or full-time position or gradu­
ate school, come in ... We recog­
nize Humanities students are 
worried, and we’re taking steps 
to change that,” said Sauri.
Unicom in the Libraries
New library management system
In early June, the University Libraries will replace the LS/2000 
collection management system with Unicom, developed by Sirsi 
Corporation. Software to access the new system will be distributed on 
campus, enabling faculty, staff and students to use Unicom from any 
computer on the Andrew network.
Like LS/2000, Unicom will include a library catalog that shows 
circulation status—that is, whether material is available in the libraries 
or checked out. Because it provides circulation information, the 
networked Unicom catalog will be an important catalog format for 
Carnegie Mellon users, augmenting the Library Catalog in LIS.
User empowerment
Unicom will also give you more control over your own library 
circulation activities and provide network access to several library 
services. With Unicorn's PIN-secured access you will be able to:
• Review your own borrowing record
• Review your own Hilary bill
• Put a hold on material that is checked out, in order to get it next
• Ask for material on interlibrary loan
• Request materials to be put on course reserve
• Recommend material for purchase by the libraries
• Notify the library that your address has changed
• Ask questions or comment about library services
• I—;—* r-----------—--------“
t *-----------------:----------*
In the next few weeks, more information about using Unicorn will 
be available in the libraries. The information will also be posted 
on the official.university-libraries bboard@andrew and on the 
libraries’ home page at http://www.library.cmu.edu.
Unicorn is the latest and most public aspect of Sirsi 
Corporation’s involvement with Carnegie Mellon’s library 
automation, on projects such as Kerberos authentication, user 
interface design, and image work, among others.

In a laddergram, the object is to transform the word on the top rung Into the word on the bottom rung In the least number of steps. During each step you must replace one letter in the previous word so that a new word is formed, but without changing the positions of the other letters. For example, we can change LEAD into GOLD in just three steps: LEAD. LOAD, GOAD. GOLD.

Vacation ’95 — Surviving the Summer
T>.* TV AHrNT WT ATT XX A TTQPXT ______________________________________________________.* __ _ __—By DAWN WALLHAUSEN
Tartan Staffwriter
When all the final projects are turned in, all the exams are done, 
all the seniors have graduated, a young person’s fancy turns to 
thoughts of ... summer. For those of you who, for one reason or 
another, find yourselves pressed to remain in sunny Pittsburgh over 
CMIJPs upcoming break, this one’s for you.
The following are some tips on how to get by in the ’Burgh over 
break on just a few bucks (note the alliteration a la “Old Man 
Donner”). It’s a veritable Survival of the Cheapest Guide to Our 
Town.
* One word: Sponge.
* Collect coffee cards.
* Max out your credit cards. It will be a few months before they 
come for you.
* Roll all of those pennies you’ve tossed in a drawer or a jar 
somewhere in your room. You’d be surprised at how long you can live 
off of spare change.
* Get a job. Get a couple of jobs. Attend some summer session 
classes and pretend to be on the roster.
Doing as much work as you’d be doing with two jobs and some 
classes, you’ll never see the light of day to know it’s summer anyhow. 
(This last statement assumes, of course, that any of us could tell the 
difference between summer in Pittsburgh and any other season in 
Pittsburgh to begin with. Hint: it might be somewhat less rainy than 
the rest of the year, or at least a little bit warmer.)
The other great thing about following this particular piece of 
advice is, not only will you be making money — you’ll be saving it, 
because you won’t have to spend it.
The drawback is ... you really won’t have time to spend it.
But seriously, folks. You want some practical tips on how to live 
cheaply and maybe even have some fun in the process? Okay.
* Eat out as little as possible. It’s invariably more expensive than 
dining in, and most of the time it’s not as healthy for you either.
* Eat lots of rice, pasta, and bread. Most grocery stores sell huge 
five ton bags of rice for, like, a dollar. You can live off of it all year. 
Grains are inexpensive and very filling—you won’t feel the need to 
eat as much of the really un-economical stuff.
* Fruits and veggies tend to be really reasonably priced, too — 
unless there are droughts in the growing region. Keep an eye out.
* Need clothes? Shop at Goodwill or the Salvation Army. I’m not 
kidding. If you look hard enough you can find really cool stuff there. 
“Mod” resale places like “Crimes of Fashion” work okay, too, but be 
cautious. They tend to be more purely cool and funky, but also a bit 
more expensive than the non-profit places.
* If you’re lucky enough to have a relative or friend who sews, ask 
them to make you something — or teach you how to do it yourself. 
Sometimes you can find great patterns in the dollar bins at sewing 
shops.
You can even make professional clothes if you get good enough, and 
they’ll be way cheaper than the $120 sportsjackets you’ll find in most 
regular stores.
Well, we’ve covered two of the basic necessities; food and clothing. 
As for the best way to shelter yourself cheaply, I refer to my very first
tip — sponge. Stay with a relative or with friends. In all truth, it’s 
tough to find good, economical housing in Pittsburgh. Some places 
will even charge you more if extra persons share in your living space.
But if you don’t mind sacrificing a bit of your privacy for a few 
months out of the year, sublet a place with some friends over the 
summer.
Now for the good stuff. I’ll refrain from mentioning some of the 
more obvious ways to have fun on a tight budget and tell you the 
following:
* Go to the “Cinema in the Parks” summer series of movies on 
Flagstaff Hill. It’s free to everyone, close by, and there are usually 
some really great films on the schedule. Pack up some pasta salad, 
some fresh fruit, a baguette and make a picnic of it.
* If you have a car, take your picnic to Hartwood Acres. During the
Franclne Gemperle/Tartan Art Co-Editor 
summer, they have a live outdoor Shakespeare Festival. Hartwood 
has an excellent troupe, the festival is also free, and, hey, it’s 
cultural!
* Hop a bus downtown. The Pittsburgh Symphony periodically 
holds performances in Point State Park. These performances also 
tend to be pretty excellent, they’re also free, and cultural too.
* The same bus that will take you to the symphony will take you 
to the Three Rivers Arts Festival. The festival provides all sorts of 
music, and entertainment — and the food’s not bad either.
So do some cool stuff if you’re stuck in the ’Burgh over summer. I 
know the school year makes it seem like there’s never anything cool 
to do here, but the upcoming season promises to prove you wrong if 
you’ll only let it. And, since most of this stuff will cost you very little, 
if anything, take advantage of it and have a great break.
Summer movies aim for plethora of audience genres
’Y GRETEL T. GAAL
Tartan Staffwriter
With summer just around the bend, 
I’m sure the biggest question on your 
mind is which movies are guaranteed to 
be the blockbusters of the season. Okay, 
maybe not, but summer movies are of­
ten the hottest tickets in town, and be­
fore you run out to spend your hard- 
earned cash, 
it’s best to do 
some prior 
planning. So, 
for those of 
you who can’t 
wait for the 
onslaught of 
premiere pic­
tures pre­
dicted for the 
summer of 
’95, here are a 
few sneak 
peeks.
One of the 
most talked- 
about upcom­
ing releases is 
Disney’s new-
Another highly anticipated movie is 
the second sequel to Batman, entitled 
Batman Forever. Featuring an all-star 
cast (Val Kilmer, replacing Michael 
Keaton, as the Caped Crusader, Chris 
O’Donnell as Robin, Tommy Lee Jones 
as Two-Face, Nicole Kidman as Dr. 
Chase Meridian, and Jim Carrey as The 
Riddler), this predicted blockbuster sup­
posedly takes a step away from the Gothic 
flavor created 
by former di­
rector Tim 
Burton. In the

Pocahontas, Disney’s summer feature release, looks 
like it will be huge in the wake of The Lion King.
est project, Pocahontas. After the major 
success of The Lion King last summer, 
audiences will surely flock to theaters to 
see this film, Disney’s 33rd full-length
direction. Also different in the movie 
is a larger Gotham City and more 
gadgets; this film used 70 sets — 10 
times more than were used inBairna/i
animated feature. Set in 1607, it is based Returns. New gadgets include every-
upon the romantic adventures of 
Pocahontas, a beautiful Native Ameri­
can, and Captain John Smith, an En­
glish settler, as legend has it, Pocahontas 
supposedly saved Smith’s life when her 
father tried to kill him (was it just be­
cause he gave her “fever?”). Unlike The 
Lion King, Pocahontas doesn’t have an 
all-star voice cast, but audiences will 
most likely recognize Mel Gibson speak­
ing the part of Smith. Although prom­
ised to be a combination of the historical 
and fantastical, the May issue of 
Movieline says “the story lacks the leave- 
’em-smiling happy ending one associ­
ates with this studio’s product.” In spite 
of this, I predict the Disney powerhouse 
will strike another blow with audiences 
this summer, and pack ’em in once again.
thing from Batbombs to Goo Guns to 
18-carat-gold handcuffs, guaranteed 
to please special-effect hounds. Of 
course, there are certain elements that 
just can’t be done away with in super­
hero movies; Kidman, naturally, plays 
Batman’s love interest, and the pres­
ence of not one, but two villains will 
surely add more spice than Danny 
DeVito’s Penguin did in the previous 
sequel. Ladies, you will surely enjoy 
this movie’s hunk potential, with 
Kilmer and O’Donnell looking amazing, 
even in tights. Watch for Carrey to steal 
the show, though; with his highly-ener- 
getic comic style, he’s a natural to play 
the Riddler. The entire movie seems 
appropriately cast; keep an eye out for a 
Drew Barrymore cameo in this film,
which I predict to be one of the top 
grossers this summer.
Action-adventure movies are often 
great summer fare as well. Bruce Willis 
reprises his role as John McClane in Die 
Hard With a Vengeance, the third film in 
the Die Hard series. Usually a one-man 
S.W.A.T. team, Willis is now teamed 
with a partner (a reluctant one, of course), 
played by Samuel L. Jackson (.Pulp Fic­
tion), and the villain in this film is Jer­
emy Irons, who fantastically voiced the 
part of Scar in The Lion King. Irons 
supposedly does well as the kind of bad 
guy we all love to hate, and the teaming 
of Willis and Jackson will undoubtedly 
add humor to what will surely be a 
profitable release for Fox;
There is always at least one big-bud- 
get picture every summer, and this year’s 
prime candidate looks to be Waterworld, 
a futuristic picture that’s set on an earth 
with no dry land, having fallen victim to 
global warming and melted polar ice 
caps which have left survivors clinging 
to life on floating, cities. Kevin Costner 
plays the solitary hope for the civiliza­
tion, and he must fight the wonderfully
emy Award-winningtechnical teams and 
production designers. Definitely guar­
anteed to have excellent special effects, 
this movie could 
be a hit if Costner 
still has enough 
star power left 
from the days of 
Dances With 
Wolves and The 
Bodyguard.

villainous Dennis Hopper (¦Speed) who 
leads a group of marauders known as

attempt to revitalize an apparently flag­
ging career (he’s coming off of three 
straight box office bombs); all the ele­
ments appear to be there, including Acad-
clearly a winner as a real-life thriller, 
and Hanks’ pure star power will most 
likely draw in the summer crowds and 
help this film 
find success in 
the upcoming 
months.

my opinion, always funny and he seems 
to have good on-screen chemistry with 
Winger. Also starring Joe Mantegna, I 
think this movie has a good chance, but 
might end up being a bigger hit on video 
than in the theaters.
Also promising summer releases: 
Braveheart, starring Mel Gibson as a 
Scottish hero in the 13th century, fight­
ing for freedom from a nasty English 
king; Mary Reilly, with Julia Roberts as 
the maid through whom we see the story

tale of Arthurian legend; Crimson Tide, 
with Denzel Washington and Gene Hack­

Reeves, who is better known 
for his looks than his acting 
ability, is the action star of the 
future, or if studio executives 
simply missed the bus.
Sure to be a hit is Apollo 13, 
starring two-time Oscar-win-

Gary Sinise (Lieutenant Dan

suspenseful, there’s also promise of a 
personal side to the story that had all of 
America as riveted as (although I would 
hope more than) O.J. for three days a 
quarter of a century ago. The story is

Movies don’t have to empty wallets
APRIL C. MOATE
fortan Staffwriter
So, you’re stuck here for the 
cummer and you’re looking for 
something to do? I was in the 
;ame boat last summer, and as 
jack would have it (good or bad, 
fm not sure yet), I will be here 
jgain, living on (ugh) campus. If 
you’ve been to Phipps Conserva­
tory and the Carnegie Museum, 
you’re sick of the Beehive, and 
you don’t have a car, one of the 
test chances for free fun happens 
0n Flagstaff Hill in Schenley 
park. Every Sunday and Wednes- 
Citiparks shows older and 
recent movies, for no charge.
If that’s not enough to get you 
over there, keep reading. On 
many nights, you can sit on the 
s before the movie starts and 
listen to a band or two. They 
perform on a small stage that you 
can see even now if you happen to 
be cutting across the park. What 
could be better than live music 
traveling in the breeze on a warm 
iummer night, especially when it 
precedes a good movie? It’s a 
great place to take a date or just 
to hang out with a bunch of your 
friends. Who knows? Maybe you 
might even meet someone new.
If you’re a “fly by the seat of 
your pants” kind of person, then 
you can feel free to show up empty- 
handed at the last minute. But if 
you’re one of those people who 
5 to plan a little ahead of 
time, there are certain things that 
you’ll want to take with you to 
maximize your enjoyment. One 
of the more basic items is a blan­
ket or a beach towel to sit on. You 
might also want to consider pack­
ing a cooler and having a little 
pre-show feast, or just some 
snacks to munch on during the 
movie. If you decide to show up 
early, try taking a frisbee or a 
football along to add to the for­
mula of a classic summer night.
If this still doesn’t appease you, 
and you’re one of those people 
who can only be truly happy with 
cushy seats and air-conditioning 
(heck, all of us succumb to it now 
and then), then do not fret. There 
are plenty of theaters in and 
around Pittsburgh where you can 
indulge yourself, for a price of 
course. Within walking distance, 
there’s the Oakland Beehive on
Forbes Avenue and there’s Manor 
theater and Squirrel Hill theater 
in Squirrel Hill. If you’re like me 
and you simply can’t sit in a the­
ater without having popcorn and 
pop (sorry, I still refuse to call it 
soda), then plan on spending 
around (don’t faint) 11 bucks a 
person.
If you’re lucky enough to have a 
car, or you can stomach getting 
on a PAT bus, then you’ll have an 
even greater range of choices. On 
the South Side (Sahth Side to you 
“Yinzers”), there’s the Rex The­
ater, which has been voted year 
after year by In Pittsburgh as 
Pittsburgh’s best theater. It’s 
clean and comfortable, and the 
sound system is great. The mu­
rals on the walls of Marilyn Mon­
roe and James Dean to indicate 
which bathroom is which, the 
neon lighting, and the outside 
ticket-selling booth create an 
atomosphere that is unique to 
any other theater in Pittsburgh.
Venturing even farther away 
from CMU might take you to, for 
example, any of the three Show­
case Cinemas. Showcase Cin­
emas East is in Monroeville (just 
before the mall), Showcase Cin­
emas North is in the North Hills 
(about ten minutes past Ross Park 
Mall), and Showcase Cinemas 
West is in Robinson Township 
(near IKEA). These theaters are 
my personal favorites. They’re 
glitzy, very commercialized, and 
they show lots of previews. Plus 
they have video games and those 
goofy instant photo booths if you 
get really bored. Still, you’re go­
ing to be forking out the big bucks. 
You’ll pay even more if you’re 
sucker for the Pick-a-Mix candy 
that they sell outside the doors 
(last I checked I think it was 
something like 20 bucks for half 
an ounce). If you happen to be 
going to dinner before the movie, 
make sure you check to see if the
restaurant sells discount movie 
tickets. Pizzaria Uno and 
Houlihan’s, to name a couple, 
sell them for $4.25 each when 
you buy a meal (saving you 
$2.25).
For something a little out of 
the ordinary, check out the 
Greater Pittsburgh Drive-In lo­
cated on the Lincoln Highway 
in East McKeesport. For five 
bucks a car, you can see two 
current movies back to back. 
Though the sound comes 
through AM radio, it’s still a 
cool place to hang out. There’s 
five theaters that you can pretty 
much see all at once, so if you 
get bored with one movie, you 
can just pull up to another one.
For those deficient in the cash 
flow area (I’ll go out on a limb 
and say most of us), but still 
craving the fake air, fake but­
ter, and big screen there’s al­
ways what I like to call ‘The 
Cheap Theaters.” I am speak­
ing, of course, of the Maxi-Saver 
Theatres located at the Cen­
tury Square Plaza and the Su­
per Saver Cinemas on 
McKnightRoad. Tickets go for 
around two dollars, but the 
movies are a few months old (or 
just really, really bad). Each 
has its own advantages: Maxi- 
Savers shows about twice as 
many movies as Super Savers, 
the tickets are fifty cents 
cheaper, and they give you free 
refills on large popcorn. Super 
Savers, however, is usually less 
crowded and has a much cooler 
atmosphere. The hallway you 
walk down to get to each of the 
theaters is like something from 
Star Wars.
Though I haven’t covered all 
of the theaters around (I’ve al­
ready gone way over my limit 
for article length), hopefully I’ve 
given you some ideas for cool 
summer fun.

Scotch ‘iV Soda closes year with Sun
By LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Editor-in-Chief 
& ANDREW SPROULE
Tartan Contributing Editor
Sun Country, written by John Biggs, sophomore 
SDS major, and directed by Anuj Vaidya, sopho­
more in H&SS, was Scotch ‘n’ Soda’s final produc­
tion of the year. The 
play was not as well 
executed as it could 
have been because 
Scotch ‘n’ Soda doesn’t 
have access to a proper 
facility in which to per­
form a play. However,
Biggs made the best of 
these less-than-ad- 
equate conditions and 
introduced a play which 
was unique and allur­
ing.
In a powerful story 
that deals with dreams 
and how we often limit 
ourselves from achiev­
ing them, this play ex­
amines the lives of four
curious; tempted by the lure of what seems to be a 
way out of this life. To Biggs’ credit, this depiction 
of life, although somber, was evocative.
There were many sensual moments in the play 
which fit perfectly into Biggs’ created underworld 
and Vaidya did a fine job of bringing these emo­
tions to life. In a scene where Maxine tries to get a 
“Piece” , Vaidya was able to let the scene get 
steamy. The in­
teraction be­
tween the two 
characters was 
erotic and was ex­
citing to see in 
such a closed en­
vironment. How­
ever, the scene 
turned somewhat 
romantic as the 
couple waltzed 
through the audi­
ence in the almost 
darkness, further 
adding to the in­
clusive atmo­
sphere of the set 
design. We also 
enjoyed the danc­
ing scene with Piece and the three dancers- Some 
parts of the choreography seemed awkward, but 
seeing such a bizarre and seductive scene in a play 
was refreshing. It was also neat to have live music 
on stage. The guitarist, Paul Tabachneck, played 
beautifully in the dancing scene and throughout 
which complemented the mood of the play.
Biggs and Vaidya utilized their space in the new 
Student Center Drill Deck by making the set of the 
play inclusive. The only thing which detracted

Slacker
Directed by Art Linkletter or Hubie Ledbetter or 
something, Slacker is about life with the undercur­
rent of society in Texas somewhere. And when we 
say undercurrent, spunk-monkey, we mean under­
current. There are women who sell Madonna’s 
placenta or something. There are people who are 
really into the J.F.K. assassination, and are writ­
ing lots of books on it, and generally getting para­
noid. There are things like people throwing stuff 
into a ravine and junk like that, and it’s pretty 
exciting, you know? In a slow, meandering kind of 
way.
I actually saw this movie once, so I can vouch for 
its interestingness. It’s a little slow at points, and 
it gets tedious, but then again, so do I. Enjoy!
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Star Trek — Generations
Well, (dork) this movie is about the starship Goat- 
face and its adventures in the great unknown. 
Starring (dork) the cast of Star Trek: The Next 
(dork) Generation as well as James Antigone Kirk 
played by William “I used to be an actor and now I 
write lots of really slow books that are kind of bad” 
Shatner, this movie is about generations of Star 
Trek-related stuff that has to do with (dork) people 
running around and doing very important things 
on-screen.
If you’re going to see this movie, you’ve probably 
already seen it once anyway, so nothing I say is 
going to help. So pull yourself out from under your 
bed long enough to mosey on down to DH2210 for 
some down-home movie action.
At 5, 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30 am.
Saturday, May 6
Disclosure
Demi Moore and Michael Douglas star in this 
movie about sexual harassment and fun computer 
stuff. Based on a novel by Michael “I like Yoghurt” 
Crichton, this movie is sort of like Oleanna, only 
Moore is the deceiving and underhanded harasser, 
and Douglas is the victimized harassee. It’s a sort 
of an interesting play on the whole idea, and I guess 
it’s pretty slick if you’re into that kind of stuff.
There are a lot of scenes with computers in it, and 
everybody likes computers, so see it with a friend. 
If you can’t find one, go make one and then go to 
Florida. Then maybe have a nice tuna melt and a 
little bit of seltzer. It’ll do your stomach good.
At 5, 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30am.

Comic books make great summer reading
COMIC BOOK CHRONICLES
By Jason Andracki
Well, here marks the end of another year of 
Comic Book Chronicles. I’m going to finish it 
off with the rest of the Top 10 summer reading 
list begun in a previous column [4/17/95 — 
Comic Book Chronicles].
Here’s the price guide so 
everyone can follow along:
$ — can be purchased for 
around cover price 
$$ — don’t buy it all at once 
$$$ — some single issues 
are in the double digits — try 
for a reprint or trade paper­
back
$$$$—wait for a reprint or 
trade paperback, unless you 
don’t feel like buying books 
next semester.
6. “Funeral for a Friend”
0Justice League America 
#70, Action Comics #’s 685,
686, Adventures of Super­
man #’s 498,499, Superman 
#’s 76,77, and Superman:
Man of Steel #’s 20, 21)
Easily the highlight of the Death and Return 
of Superman storylines, which is saying a lot.
It was interesting to see how Superman’s 
close friends, the citizens of Metropolis, and
even his enemies, reacted to his death. The 
covers were formatted in the same way and 
that gave it a more complete look.
$$ — trade paperback available
7. The Mighty Thor #’s 337 - 340 “Ballad 
of Beta Ray Bill”
Although his name is a bit silly, Beta Ray 
Bill, along with Walter Simonson, helped 
rejuvenate the dying Thor title. This story 
dispels the myth that Thor is the only one 
worthy to lift his hammer, Mjolinir. I think 
every writer at Marvel should read this too, 
to see what the good old days were like.
$$ — trade paperback available.
8. Excalibur #’s 1-70
All the storylines run together, so it’s hard 
to pick out one single standout 
chunk. This is the Alan Davis 
run on the title; avoid any­
thing after #70 as if it were 
radioactive poison.
$$$ — actually affordable, 
though. The first eight issues 
are the only pricey ones.
©DC Comics 
One of the highest-rated 
comic events was the 
funeral of Superman.
9. The Light and Darkness 
War (six-issue mini-series)
Ever wonder what Tom 
Veitch and Cam Kennedy did 
before Star Wars : Dark Em­
pire!? This limited series from 
Epic was the first pairing of 
these two. It’s top-notch fan­
tasy with somewhat of a 
Valhalla allusion. A disabled 
Vietnam vet is given his legs 
back only to fight in another war. Hard to 
find, but definitely worth the effort.
$ — it’s cheap, probably $10 for all six 
issues, depending on where you go.
10. “Kraven’s Last Hunt” {Web of Spi­
der-Man #’s 31,32, Amazing Spider-Man 
#’s 293,294, Spectacular Spider-Man #’s 
131,132)
Another top Spider-Man tale of my gen­
eration, with J.M. DeMatteis providing his 
patented spooky storytelling and Mike Zeck’s 
(third appearance in the Top 10) powerful 
pencils. Kraven hunts down Spidey and bur­
ies him alive. Probably not as good as the 
Stan Lee stuff, but like I said, one of the best 
of my time.
$$$$ — worth every penny, too. There is a 
hard cover trade paperback, but it’s hard to 
find.
Here are a few honorable mentions: all .'of 
John Byrne’s Next Men (pretty affordable, 
and trade paperback are available, too) are 
really excellent.
The Books of Magic limited series h&s 
great Neil Gaiman {Sandman) stuff plus! a 
different painter for each issue, and Spawn 
#’s 12 and 13 are Todd McFarlane’s best non- 
Spidey work.
That’s all for this year. Enjoy your sum­
mer! If you need to kill some time between 
finals, Mart Nodell, the creator of Green 
Lantern (before Hal Jordan wigged out) is 
appearing at Phantom of the Atticon Thurs­
day, May 11. Also, for the serious collectors, 
the Pittsburgh Comicon on May 12 to 14 at 
the Expo Mart in Monroeville.
Some top names are Marc Silvestri, Bemie 
Wrigtson, and Curt Swan. Email me for 
more information.
. This is the last time Jason Andracki will be 
labeled a sophomore professional writing 
major. His college career is half way over 
(cynic) and he’s depressed that this is his 
second to last summer vacation.
Golden Tso awarded
ANCIENT CHINESE 
SECRETS
By Ido Ben-Shachar 
and Aaron Weisberg
The semester is finally over, 
and that means it’s time to an­
nounce the winner of the coveted 
Golden Tso award. Let’s quickly 
recap what this award stands for. 
First, the restaurant receiving 
this honor has clearly demon­
strated proficiency and expertise 
in preparing General Tso’s 
chicken. Second, they have cute 
waitstaff. But, most importantly, 
each dish must be beautiful and 
delicious (the food, not the 
waitstaff).
Over the past semester, we’ve 
reviewed over 10 Ghinese restau­
rants. In addition to this, we have 
eaten at many more, and have 
the guts to prove it.
But the best restaurant by far, 
and winner of the coveted Golden 
Tso award, is (egg-roll please ...) 
China Palace in Shadyside!!! 
Time and time again, their Tsois 
by far the most superior, delec­
table, juicy, tangy, fresh, yummy, 
crispy on the outside, chicken on 
the inside, chicken we’ve found in 
all of Pittsburgh. We congratu­
late China Palace and are sure 
that they will continue in their 
tradition of excellence.
As we leave for the summer, we 
think it’s important to make sure 
everyone learned something this 
semester. So we’ve prepared a 
quiz to test your knowledge on 
American-Chinese cuisine.
If you’d like, you can send it in 
to be graded.
1. How many licks does it take 
to get to the chicken center of 
a General Tso’s chicken 
chunk?
a) one
b) two
c) three, three licks (chomp)
d) the world may never know
2. General Tso is:
a) the good guys’ orange car
SUMMER 
STORAGE
Pick-up 
Available 
471-1144
from Dukes of Hazzard
b) the guy buried in Grant’s 
tomb
c) dead
3. Tea makes you:
a) tired
b) nervous
c) piss
4. Number four was incred­
ibly stupid and has been cut.
5. Sweet and sour pork is
a) an ice-cream flavor
b) a manic-depressive pig
c) bad for your transmission
6. China Palace is:
a) The residence of Imperial 
and Empress chicken
b) The name of the new student 
center
c) Home of the Whopper
7. Yum Wok is:
a) disgusting
b) not a chain for a reason
c) a misnomer
d) all of the above
8. Shrimp chips are:
a) a type of shrimp
b) a type of chip
c) Styrofoam with a twist
9. Won Ton is:
a) the respective first names of 
Milli and Vanilli
b) a genetic experiment gone 
awry
c) two-thousand pounds
10. Most fortune cookie for­
tunes are written by:
a) Confucius
b) Nostradamus
c) The Psychic Friends Hotline
Good luck taking the above 
quiz. There aren’t necessarily any 
“right” answers, since almost all 
are wrong anyway.
Also, congratulations once 
again to China Palace. If it isn’t 
obvious by now, we give them five 
out of five Tso’s. This makes them, 
in our opinion, the best Chinese 
Restaurant in Pittsburgh.
As we head into summer, we 
can only imagine how much MSG 
we’re going to be taking in. We 
hope you can do the same and 
will join us again next semester.
Fortune of the summer: “Go 
wild and crazy with Chinese food.” 
And where are we going next 
time? Italian...

Keanu Reeves stars as a man on the run from a 
crime mob in the sci-fi thriller Johnny Mnemonic, 
due for release this summer.
Eclectic mix graces 
summer movie lineup
MOVIES, from page L9
one film to watch for is Sudden Death, a movie set in Pittsburgh I 
and starring everyone’s favorite pumped-up, Karate Kid-sized I 
star, Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Like Bruce Willis in Striking Distance, Van Damme finds 
himself caught 
up in the action 
and danger of 
our fine ’Burgh; 
this time, a 
group of terror­
ists plans to 
blow up the 
Civic Arena dur­
ing the seventh 
game of the 
Stanley Cup Fi­
nals (you may 
remember the 
open invitations 
in which people 
were encour­
aged to go down 
to the Arena to 
fill in the crowd 
scenes).
With the Penguins and Van Damme on the same screen, I’m 
sure to be in heaven, and I know other Pittsburgh dwellers will 
be curious to see how the city shapes up on the big screen. This
movie also stars 
Ross Malinger as 
Van Damme’s son; 
most will remem­
ber Malinger as 
Tom Hanks’ ador­
able match-mak­
ing son in the ro- 
mantic comedy 
Sleepless in Se­
attle.
While these are 
far from the only 
movies coming out 
this summer (and- J|L fall), they are ©Bob Marshak r ,some of che onesDrew Barrymore and Chns O'Donnell play love reCeivin£rthemost 
Interests in Mad Love, a romantic comedy attention from the 
about teenage romance. media and the
most anticipation from the general public. Though most of us 
don’t ha ve the cash flow to see all of these films, I would definitely 
suggest checking out at least a few if you have the time and 
money. I’m really looking ahead to the summer releases, consid­
ering the rather uneventful post-Oscar films in the theaters 
lately. Most of the film release dates are tentative at this point 
and subject to change, so keep an eye and ear open for previews 
and trailers. Have a great summer, and enjoy!

Trustees: U purchased 
by giant conglomerate
By JASON “KERWIN” TOJA
Natrat Minister of Propaganda
The Board of Trustees announced yesterday that the University has been purchased by Exxon.
The purchase price of CMU was said to be approximately $4.5 billion. It was unclear at press 
time how the price would be paid, although sources at the University indicated that the money
would be secretly transferred into the private, ------------------------------------------------------------
numbered Swiss*bank account that the Trust­
ees maintain.
Many members of the Carnegie Mellon commu­
nity said that they were stunned by the announce­
ment.
“I’m stunned,” said Reginald P. Firthwirthy, as­
sistant senior vice president in charge of thinking 
up long job descriptions, holding fancy tea parties, 
and requisitioning garbage bags. “I mean, sure,
Morton Thiokol or Grumman, I could see — even 
General Dynamics — but Exxon? Come on.”
Trustee Edward “Teddy” Scaife Mellon, chief ex­
ecutive officer and owner of the Greensburg, Penn, 
based Tribune-Astonisher newspaper, said that the 
Board carefully considered many things in deciding 
to sell the University, but in the end, it all came down 
to one thing.
“Money,” said Scaife Mellon. “Great big dripping 
gobs of it. Moolah moolah moolah. I’m talking big- 
time bribes, baby!”
Shirley Blimfark, a student senator and junior 
electrical engineering major [Ed. note: A female in 
CIT? No way! When’d they start admitting women?], 
said that she was “nauseated” by the sale.
“I puked in my Cheerios,” said Blimfark.
“What right does the Board of Trustees have to 
determine how the University is run?” said Blimfark.
“I mean, they've got some nerve! Here I am, paying 
$20,000 a year to come to this bung-hole of a school, 
and they go pull this shit! Oooh!”
Blimfark hinted that a strongly worded resolu­
tion may be written by Student Senate. “Boy, will 
they [the Board of Trustees] be sorry!”
Scaife Mellon said that the needs of students were 
on the minds of the trustees when they voted.
“It was hard to ignore them,” he said, “but we 
managed.”
“We’re the trustees,” he added. “We can do any­
thing we damn well please! And Firthwirthy’s butt 
will be the first one out the door, believe me.”
A spokesman for Exxon in Houston, Ifexas, said that 
he could not say for certain what the company’s plans for 
CMU will be.
“The first thing they’ll do is hire all of the students,” 
said Exxon’s Hyerd Moufpeas.
Of course, said Moufpeas, poor economic conditions will 
likely cause the company to lay all of the students off.
“With no students, I frankly see no need for a Student 
Senate,” Moufpeas said. “But, that’s up to our board of 
directors to decide.”
Graduate students all over campus said that this was 
another case in which the needs of graduate students were 
ignored.
“This is blatant out-and-out disrespect of grad stu­
dents,” one said. “Although, if Exxon was willing to hire 
us after we get our degrees, maybe a deal could be worked 
out...”
Vince “The iK? is Silent” Knoodle, the resident CMU 
throwback, said that he fully supports the purchase of 
the University by Exxon.
“Exxon brings a sensitivity to environmental issues to CMU 
that the current administration lacks,” said Knoodle, “and I'm 
not just saying that because they’re holding my family hostage. 
Ouch!”
Prez no stiff; witness sez...
Tricky Dick joins walking dead
YORBA LINDA, Calif., May 1 (EIEIO) — 
Richard Nixon rose from the dead here to­
day, less than a week after he was buried. 
Witnesses at the Richard Nixon Library 
and Birthplace reported seeing the fresh 
ground covering Nixon’s grave open and a 
hand flashing the “V for Victory” sign ex­
tend out of the hole. 
The ex-dead ex-President then stood up 
on top of his coffin and said “I am not a 
corpse!” his famous jowls flapping.
Nixon then climbed out of the grave and chat­
ted with astonished tourists, some of whom 
fainted dead away at the sight of the walking 
dead man.
Raymond Freezburg of Des Moines, Iowa, said 
that Nixon looked to be in remarkably good 
shape, except for the pasty color of his skin and 
numerous bullet-holes left when security 
guards at the library shot silver bullets at him.
“I told my wife, ‘Don’t look, Ethel!’ ” said Freezburg. 
“But it was too late. She’d already been driven mad, 
clawing her eyeballs plum out of her head. She was 
once mooned like that, too.”
Doctors say they are astonished that the 37th 
President was able to rise from the dead.
“I would have thought the embalming fluid would 
have killed him,” said Dr. Cyril Wecht, former Al­
legheny County coroner and a noted forensic patholo­
gist. “Of course, he’s made more comebacks than 
Dracula, so I guess it shouldn’t surprise me. You don’t 
suppose he is Dracula, do you?”
Wecht says that there is also precedent for people 
rising from the dead. “Jesus did, after all,” he said.
Nixon told assembled reporters at the scene not 
to discount his further political aspirations. “You 
won’t have Dick Nixon to stick in the ground any 
more,” he said.
Wecht says that if Nixon ever appears to die again, he 
recommends driving a wooden stake through his heart. 
“It couldn't hurt," says Wecht. “Only Nixon, that is.”
Late word from Seattle says that in a copy-cat move, former 
lead singer for Nirvana Kurt Cobain is also considering rising 
from the dead.

Rodham Clinton mulling run for top spot in exec?
By ERIC “ J. J.” DARKMAN
Natrat Deputy Minister of Propaganda
The White House continues to react with confusion and anxiety 
following First Lady Hillary Clinton’s announcement that she will 
seek the Republican nomination for President in 1996.
In an exclusive interview with The Natrat, Clinton explained 
that she feels she ought to be receiving the President’s paycheck 
since she is doing his job anyway. Current President Bill Clinton 
said, “I don’t know what kind of shot she has, but at least if she 
wins, nothing around here will change.”
It seems that everyone in both the
White House and Hollywood is just 
itchin’ to join one of the sides. As ex­
pected, Roseanne has joined Hillary’s 
team. Husband Tom Arnold offered his 
services to Bill but was dismissed af­
ter a dispute over a McDonald’s pickle. 
President Clinton offered no comment 
on the issue, but Arnold said “once it 
was already in my mouth I feel that it 
was kind of outta line to threaten me 
with another tax hike.”
Singer Barbara Streisand, well 
known for her political activism, has 
decided to increase the price of tickets 
for her concerts in order to help raise 
money for the “Hillary for President” 
organization. In a press conference 
Streisand addressed the current Presi­
dent to say “bite me, lick me honey! 
Now I’m playing D.C.” Clinton, misun-
derstanding Streisand’s intentions 
asked “what time?”
White House advisor George 
Snuffleupagus has decided to stick by 
his boss. In an attempt to damage 
Hillary Clinton with some of the prob­
lems that marred Bill Clinton’s cam­
paign, Stephanopoloponolous said “it 
really is true, she still hasn’t exhaled.” 
Other rumors about the First Lady 
now floating around the capital are that 
she likes to pick flowers and keeps the 
White House curtains drawn in order 
to avoid drafts.
Socks, unable to comment on the situa­
tion, chooses to rest in Vice-President A1 
Gore’s office where a lack of movement en­
sures that she will not be disturbed. Com­
pletely confused by recent incidents, 
Chelsea Clinton has gone to stay with in­
dependent candidate Ross Perot.
At Stupid Senate...Same crap, different day
By JASON “KERWIN” TO JA
Natrat Minister of Propaganda
Stupid Senate was up to its same old shit last week. Tuesday, Senate de­
cided to rewrite its bylaws to include a clause requiring all senators to swear 
their loyally to “the dark side.”
“No, I don’t have time to talk,” said Sena­
tor Money Sings, a fifth-year architect. “You 
guys interview me every week. It’s not like 
I don’t have a yearbook to put out.”
Actually, these Senate articles are death 
on a page. Really, just put the word, “Sen­
ate” in a headline, and people think, “Gee, 
I wonder what Calvin and Hobbes are up 
to?” Seriously. Unless the headline said, 
“Senate dissolved!”
The oath to Satan was suggested by 
Crystal Rexall, an IM senator and phar­
macy major.
“We did it mostly to freak out you guys,” 
said Rexall. “It worked, didn’t it?”
The amendment to the bylaws also 
freaked out the Society for Cramming 
Christianity Down People’s Throats. 
SCCDPT President Billy Ray Paradakas 
said that the group has considered asking 
God to send a plague locusts to the 
Whereat Room.
“It didn’t seem like it was worth it,” 
Paradakas said. “I mean, it’s in Skibo any­
way. How much worse could locusts be?” 
Paradakas said, instead, they are pray­
ing for the deaths of all Senators. In addi­
tion, they have asked God to send them a 
better acronym.
“This shows a complete lack of concern 
for the needs of graduate students,” said 
one grad student. “I mean, what if you don’t 
want to worship Satan? What if you’re just 
a pagan or a Druid? Grad students don’t 
have the time to make the sort of 
committment it takes to worship Lucifer.”
At this point, everyone stops reading 
Senate articles, especially Sings, Rexall, 
and that other guy, who read this far just 
to see how bad I misquoted them this week. 
Let me just say that the only reason The 
Natrat runs these stupid things is because:
a) Nothing ever happens at CMU. At 
least, nothing that we feel like cover­
ing, and
b) We’re in to them for like, $20,000, and 
we have to keep them happy by writing 
about them all the time.
We sell out to anyone. Want to run abor­
tion advertising? Call us! Tbbacco manufac­
turers always welcome! No morals? No 
problem! Hoo hoo hoc!
Hey! Get away from me! I don’t want a shot!

OOPS! A student was run over and killed last week while attempting to get to 
a class in Doherty Hall. Driver of the truck was Physical Plant Light-Bulb Chang­
ing Crew Foreman Skip "Robert" Toomalou, who suffered minor injuries when 
a donut lodged in his throat and coffee fell in his lap.
Floods consume campus
By DICK “TATER” SPROGGLE
Natrat Indoctrination Specialist
Thus it came to pass. On the 41st 
day, after 40 days and 40 nights of 
torrential rain, did He who must 
be obeyed, the honorable 
Mehrabian descend upon His 
loyal following. He spake thusly 
to two students from each college, 
"Lo, I have seen the pain that the 
rain in the plain has caused. Verily, 
have I considered closing down 
the university; however being that 
we are still able to attend classes 
with the aid of scuba equipment, 
let it be decreed that indeed we 
will succeed in keeping the school 
open."
"Whateth," the faithful spoke bale- 
fully unto Him. "For we are much 
wet and the ink does not stayeth 
upon our parchment while we taketh 
notes. While our pecs developeth 
nicely from swimming to class, we 
learn nothing," the faithful continued 
to whine.
Though the Big Cheese of Pittsburgh 
has movethed his people into the prom­
ised land of dryness and low stress liv­
ing, Mehrabian did not agree with his 
decision. "Beholdeth, if we spare the rod, 
we spoil the student. In My days, before
I was He, I was forced to eat hot coals 
and breathe water in order to just get into 
school."
After much discussion with the El­
ders, He decided that verily, the only way 
the university would closeth would be if 
many swarms of locusts descendeth on 
the school. In order to passifyeth the 
faithful He offered unto them His only 
son to come unto them and give of him­
self.
Lo then it came to pass that a member 
of the students-who-do-not-believe-in- 
anything-that-doesn't-benefit-them 
spake, "He only giveth to those who do 
not need as we need. We need His only 
son and His only daughter to pacify our 
needs."
Mehrabian responded thusly, "You 
hath disappointed me and I 
commandeth that a swarm of locusts 
descend upon you whiners." Thus it 
came to pass that the university shuteth 
down.
Ironic what?

me where), and social life (I have none, 
unless you count the imaginary naked 
girlfriend I’ve scanned on to my An­
drew screen.) Can you help me? —Des­
perate and Depressed
Dear Loser: Of course I can help 
you, stupid. It sounds like you’re hav­
ing serious problems. It’s important 
that you realize life can be hard some­
times, and we must find it within us 
to overcome these hardships.
How to do this? Writing a poem, 
drawing a picture, and writing a let­
ter are all—let’s face it—pretty lame- 
ass ways to make yourself feel better. 
Myself, I find it always helps to get 
piss-drunk. Getting loaded is without
a doubt the best way to solve your prob­
lems. For one thing, it’s cheap. For an­
other, it allows you to be cheap — an 
anonymous, beer goggling-induced 
sexual encounter makes for a sure-fire 
ego boost! Finally, when you wr.ke up 
the following morning, head pounding, 
stomach churning (whoops! Ha ha! 
Forgot to warn you about that grain 
alcohol punch, didn’t I?), and a mighty 
strange bedfellow by your side, voila! 
Your previous problems seem a lot less 
important now. Happiness and fulfill­
ment are once again within your grasp!
Like, The Answer Lady’s year and 
major are none of your fucking busi­
ness, and remember, The Answer Lady 
hates you.Cowabunga!

do? Your friend, :) —Dorkman
Dear Dork: Unpack your bags, my

population: YOU!
(And several thou­
sand other dorks who 
call Carnegie Mellon 
home.) Nowhere else 
in the world will you 
find such a high con­
centration of your own 
kind, so live it up! For 
maximum assimila­
tion, I suggest that 
you stop showering, 
gain 100 pounds, and 
become a total fashion 
nightmare. Comput­
ers are your new best 
friends, so customize 
your Andrew account 
with haste (scanned-in centerfolds of 
naked women suit the distinguished 
dork quite nicely!) Star Trek — watch 
it, worship it, live it! Mate with an 
equally dorky female person and watch 
both heads and stomachs turn as you 
kiss each other passionately in public 
places — what fun! Even better, fol-
low a normal female around and send 
her romantic email, or — dare I evèn 
mention it?—zephyrgrams! Take any 
reaction to mean she’s interested — 
even when she runs 
away, screaming 
and throwing pipe 
bombs behind her. 
Congratulations! 
Your transforma­
tion is now com­
plete!
Oh, and you 
think I’m “your 
friend”? Ha ha! I’d 
no sooner be your 
friend than I’d duct- 
tape myself naked 
to the glass parti­

my neck that says “I 
think geeks are très

Natrat Staffwrither
In an investigation by this 
Natrat reporter, it was revealed 
that vegetarian Tartan colum­
nist Matt Ball works for the 
American Beef Board.
Ball receives what one source de­
scribed as a “handsome” salary, as well 
as all the steak tartar he can eat, for 
various Beef Board projects, including 
a “Beefcakes of the Beef Industry” 
swimsuit calendar in which Ball, clad 
only in a leopardskin loincloth, strikes 
a seductive pose with a hanging side 
of raw meat. “I’m so hot I’m cookm’!” 
reads the caption beneath. “Have a 
barbecue today! Love, Mr. July, Matt 
Ball-licous.”
Other projects of Ball’s, according to 
the source, include a public relations 
campaign to replace the time-honored 
proverb “An apple a day keeps the doc­
tor away” with “Better eat steak today
— it keeps homos away.”
“The Beef Board doesn’t have no 
comment, see,” mumbled a company 
spokesperson who looked alarmingly 
like the kind of weirdo they show get­
ting arrested on the evening news as 
the anchor drones: “Here you see Earl
Skunkley being taken into custody ear­
lier tonight. He’s suspected of ... well, 
whatever it’s called when you put your 
wife and kids through the Vegematic 
and try to get rid of the evidence by 
saying that it’s ‘just some onion dip.’ ” 
Numerous attempts were made to 
contact Ball for comment; he was fi­
nally reached at a local burger joint, 
alternating between brandishing an 
electric cattle prod at the salad-eating 
customers and gnawing thoughtfully 
on a piece of what he termed “fun-to- 
chew gristle.” “Hey, I’m doing all 
a’yunz a favor,” he grunted. “When 
people start questioning red meat, it’s 
just a short step to atheism and homo­
sexuality ... hey! You with the French 
fries! Let’s talk’!”
So why the anti-meat columns in 
The Tartan? “Reverse psychology!” 
Ball bellowed. Then he laughed heart­
ily and spat blood onto the floor.
“Actually, it’s really just something
I do to amuse myself,” he said, “like 
kicking puppies into traffic and train­
ing my pet pit bulls to attack helpless 
kittens — you know, good old Ameri­
can fun!”
A book of Ball’s columns, entitled 
“Get a life—Meat Rules!” will be pub­
lished this fall. Ball is also working on 
his memoirs of organizing illegal cock­
fights in Mexico.
I can’t think of a headline
By MIKE DORKYO
The Chicago Tribune
I was sitting on my bar stool the 
other day when Slats Grobnik 
walked in.
“I just can’t stand it anymore,” 
Slats said.
“Stand what?” I asked.
“All this talk about stopping vio­
lence. In my day we never worried 
about violence. When you wanted 
something, you just went out and 
took it!”
“Like what, for example?”
“Like a date. If I wanted a date, 
I’d just walk up to a girl and say, 
‘Look her, you whiny tart. Be ready 
at 7 o’clock tonight or 111 bust out 
all your teeth.’ And she’d get the 
message.”
“But isn’t that uncivilized?” 
Slats guffawed. “Nah, that the 
liberals telling you that. President 
Hillary and the rest of them. That’s 
the code of the jungle.”
“Sounds pretty rough,” I said. 
“That’s what my wife said. So I 
shot her.”
“You shot her?”
“Yep. And buried her in the back­
yard.”
“You buried her in the backyard?” 
“TJh huh. First I chopped her up 
into little pieces, then I put the 
pieces into plastic bags, and buried 
her in different locations. Then I put
large heavy objects over top—con­
crete slabs, you name it.”
“You chopped her up into little 
pieces, put them into plastic...” 
“Are you going to repeat every­
thing I say?”
“Am I going to repeat everything 
you say?”
“Yeah.”
“I dunno.”
“Well, I just thought that I 
should tell someone this. Anyway, 
the bitch was lipping off to me. She 
had it coming.”
“Isn’t what you did illegal?” 
“Why? I’m a veteran. I pay my 
taxes. Not like these punks running 
around today. No, I fought in the 
big one, WWII!”
“That doesn’t give you the right 
to kill someone, does it?”
“Oh yeah, Mr. Bleeding-Heart 
Artsy Fartsy Pansy Wansy? Well, 
since I’m a fictional character that 
you live vicariously through, what

Lose Weight!
Actual documented assumptions
By HOPEA LOSEALooking for love in all the wrong places
French physicist, Dr. Roger Heydt, recently reported his earth- shatter­
ing discovery that will allow you to lose up to 50 pounds and 8 inches from your 
waist in just a matter of hours. "Its very complicated", stated Heydt. "The weight 
loss occurs on a molecular level, at an unbelievable rate. "Using time lapse pho­
tography, Natrat staffers were able to see the miracle weight loss. We witness the 
Dr. administering the treatment to a patient who went from a rather hefty 587 
pounds to only 53 pounds over the two and one half hour duration.
"I have been flooded with calls from all over the world", says Heydt "but 
because this is still in the experimental stages, my miracle treatment may not be 
available world wide for quite some time." Dr. Heydt refused to comment on the 
rumor that he has been contacted President Robert Mehrabian (Mario) of Camagee 
Mellun University to assist with the razing of Sklibo Hall. The only comment 
Heydt would make regarding the subject was accompanied by a rather sarcastic 
glare as he stated: "If science were capable of boundless feats such as that, the 
world would be a perfect place".
While on the subject of weight loss and the upcoming swimsuit season, we 
sent Natrat staffwritters out to see what your professors felt on the matter.
President Mehrabian felt that a complete double standard when dealing with 
university matters and bumbling and procrastination of much needed university 
affairs and funds gave him his sleek summer look.
Chief LaPaglia felt that restricting access to all academic buildings and mak­
ing life even worse for students rushing to finish that late night project kept him 
slim and trim.
The entire Student Senate was polled on the matter. 1/3 felt that completely 
lying to gain an office that they only want because it will look good on a resume 
is a great way to make sure that suit from last year will still fit. 5/11 of the senate 
was unavailable for comment. Three senators were still unaccounted for after the 
student-senate stag party. And the remaining senators were still being too pissy 
over the whole plus minus grading system to comment.
Finally, we felt we needed the Greek opinion, so we headed over to the frater­
nity quad early one Saturday morning. Strangely enough, we couldn't find a 
single conscious person for comment.
The Boy Dean stars in 
newest “art”
By RANDY BONES
Daily Natrat Writer
This week, a new movie from director Strip Lee opened in video 
stores and movie theatres all over town. A Dish Called Wanda, starring 
Delores Canyon and our very own Boy Dean, Michael Murphy, tells the story of 
a young man's adventures in an Italian restaurant. The first five minutes, featur­
ing The Boy Dean and the relative unknown, Louise "Tips" Galore were interest­
ing. Then, unfortunately the movie got uninteresting and I went to get a drink of 
water.
The plot was simple and direct in it's vibrant depiction of love and conversa­
tion in these hectic modern times. The action never let up except for brief patches 
of dialogue which allowed me to recover from the intensity, as it were. The Boy 
Dean and Canyon's "spagetti dance" was a favorite scene as well as the seltzer 
and whipped cream fight near the end. However, I felt guilty for watching some­
thing this good, but the guilt soon let up and all was right with the world. Ex­
cepting a few clinker lines delivered by The Boy Dean, his command of the screen 
was admirable. Making up for a lack of... stature, he kept the action fast a furious 
until they started talking again. Canyon gave a performance from the very bo­
som of her soul that reminded me why I watched movies in the first place.
Wanda is currently available in the "back rooms" of most video stores, but I'm 
sure it will become a classic. Lee is to this genre as to what vaseline is to the 
counter-culture set.

Suck back on this DoD
By LOLITA SHMITNatrat Investigative Reporter
DA BURGH, April 1 (Reuters) 
— The Software Engineering In­
stitute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon 
University (CMU) in Pittsburgh 
(Pgh) declared war on the Depart­
ment of Defense (DoD) yesterday.
SEI made the announcement 
yesterday following a nuclear 
strike on the Pentagon (5-gon) in 
Washington, D.C. (DC). Sources at 
the University told The West Home­
stead (Penn.) Shopper's Guide and 
Used Car Index that the adminis­
tration at SEI is "really cheesed 
off" that the DoD is investigating 
the University.
"Ungrateful bastards," said the 
source. "We made the DoD (De-
fense Department) everything it 
is today, and what thanks do we 
get? A subpeona! Besides, they 
never call, they never write, they 
never send flowers..."
The missiles were apparently 
launched from a missile silo un­
derneath Hamerschlag Hall on 
the CMU campus, and fired 
through the building's cupola. 
Extensive damage was done to 
the building.
In an unrelated story, fifteen 
electrical and computer engineer­
ing (ECE) students are reported 
missing at this time, although it 
is not clear if they are the same 
students reportedly seen clinging 
onto the nose cones of missiles 
streaking across the Oakland sky.

Just-left-of-middle hitter
The highlight of the women's volley­
ball season was the unexpected upset of 
the previously undefeated Bears of 
Washington University. But former star­
lets junior Danielle "I must have passed 
out" Walter and sophomore Courtney 
"totally" Booker paid no attention as 
they tapped the keg at the end of the 
bench.
The tides turned when sophomore 
hitter Patty "I brought all my knee pads, 
so I have them" Bruno ripped a line 
drive down the court and down her 
spandex. That shut the crowd up right 
away and confused freshman Evette 
"I'm sorry" Riverera. CMU won the 
match by a landslide, 15-0, and they 
didn't even have to resort to referee brib­
ery or sexual favors for the line judge.
In between games a reporter pulled 
sophomore Jen "I turned cool this year" 
Goetz aside to ask her a few questions. 
She replied, "I was hurt at practice to­
day."
The reporter asked, "Where you hurt 
physically or emotionally?" Goetz said, 
"Well, first my coach called me names, 
then she pushed me down and my shoes 
fell off."
Head coach Heather "hoser" 
Hollands is currently under harassment
charges, eh? She has been busy doing 
200 hours of community service. In her 
free time she dates high school guys as 
a cover to spy on recruits. It is rumored 
that she is secretly trying to join the six 
member, Wash U. assistant coaching 
staff because she has been spotted wear­
ing green and red bows in her hair. Her 
latest thrill however, is watching chariot 
races through Schenley and busting un­
derage drinkers during intense card 
games.
The reporter asked Jen "she was just 
a phase" New to reflect on the glorious, 
media coverage of her senior year.
"I'm da best. Let me show you my 
tools. I can run circles around those 
guys," New said.
New was perhaps the most clueless 
player to ever step, or rather, trip, on a 
volleyball court. She will be missed 
greatly, especially her Madonna tunes at 
the back of the bus on road trips and her 
ability to make feminine hygiene fly. 
Also, the team wishes New luck getting 
over her phobia of high ceilings, bun 
hugger uniforms, and locker room stalk­
ers.-
In preparation for the Fall season the 
team has set high goals. Sarah "ball be­
fore body" Pacocha vows never to over­
sleep again and to clean up her filthy 
mouth. Molly "tough guy" Brennan 
promises not to sleep with the next man­
ager in order to get a starting position. 
But, for those of you who are interested 
in managing the team, the position is 
open. Brennan will be conducting oral 
interviews this summer.
Come out and watch the games in the 
fall. You don't want to miss cute clucks 
playing with balls.

His team were supposed to qualify
