Student Senate impeaches Student Government President
By FRANK MICHELS
ByFRyA NKKMKRyAR ICHK ELMRSF
At Thursday’s Student Senate hear­
ing, Senate passed a proposal to begin 
impeachment proceedings for Student 
Government President Natalie 
Gesmond. The proposal passed by a vote 
ofl3-3-1. According to the Bylaws of 
the Student Body, the Student Govern­
ment President may be impeached by a 
two-thirds vote of Student Senate.
On March 30, Student Senate will 
begin impeachment hearings against 
Gesmond if three-fourths of Senate —
16 of the 21 Senators — are present. 
According to the bylaws, a three-fourths 
vote of the Senators present is required 
to remove the Student Government 
President from office.
Chair of Student Senate Greg 
Haverkamp, who proposed the impeach­
ment, said in an official post to 
assocs.student-senate, “The grounds for 
impeachment were lack of duty perfor­
mance, failing to uphold mandatory du­
ties, and violation of the Bylaws of the 
Student Body of Carnegie Mellon Uni­
versity.”
The bylaws say that the Student Gov­
ernment President has three duties: “At­
tend, or designate an alternate to at­
tend, all Student Senate meetings and 
Faculty Senate meetings as an ex-officio 
member; Post and keep weekly office 
hours at an on-campus and student- 
accessible location; Review any legisla­
tion passed by Student Senate within 72 
hours of passage.”
At the Student Senate meeting, 
Haverkamp said that Gesmond, who 
had frequently been absent from Senate 
meetings, failed to post and keep office 
hours, failed to return messages from 
him, and failed to create committees 
that were approved by Student Senate.
Last semester, Gesmond left the cam­
pus because of medical treatment for a 
serious blood disease that she has had 
for the last four years.
Haverkamp said that the Student 
Government President is required to 
attend all Student Senate, Faculty Sen­
ate, President’s Student Advisory Coun­
cil (PSAC), and University Student Af­
fairs Committee (USAC) meetings. 
Haverkamp said that since he is a mem­
ber of Student Senate and PSAC, he has 
not seen her at some meetings. He also
said that she has not attended Faculty 
Senate meetings, based on the minutes 
of each meeting.
Gesmond said that she does not al­
ways have a different report. She said, 
“The liability issue of SafeWalk has 
taken a lot of my time. Itisnotnecessary 
to say the same thing each week.” She 
also said that even when she does give a 
report, “I am rarely questioned about it 
and it seems that Senators are not al­
ways interested.”
Larson said, “Student Senate is out of 
touch with the student body. There is no 
logic behind disposing of her. This is a 
serious matter and should not [have 
been] brought up as a grievance.” 
Larson said that Senators have also 
failed to contact him. “Not once has 
anyone from Student Senate called me,” 
he said. “There was great disapproval 
when I gave reports for [Gesmond] as 
her alternate, yet I am second in com­
mand to her.”
“The main problem here Is the lack of com­
munication between Student Senate and 
Student Government.”
— Natalie Gesmond, 
Student Government President
Haverkamp said that Student Senate 
can not tolerate lack of performance. 
“Even if [Gesmond] does not have a 
report, she must have an alternate.” 
Haverkamp also said that the impeach­
ment was necessary. He said, “She has 
gotten little accomplished.... The Stu­
dent Mentor program is dying [and] the 
SafeWalk program is not hers. I feel she 
has not helped in the matter of 
SafeWalk.”
Gesmond disagreed. She said, “I was 
not elected to attend Student Senate 
meetings; I was elected to produce and 
attend to the students’ needs.... I feel I 
have done everything to attend to the 
students’ needs.”
Gesmond calls the impeachment pro­
posal a “publicity stunt at [her] expense 
to assert [Student Senate’s] impeach­
ment power.” She said that illness has 
been the reason that she has not been 
present at Senate meetings. She said, 
“When I’m in the hospital or away from 
campus, my health comes first.” 
Haverkamp said at the Senate meet­
ing that the impeachment will send a 
clear message to future Student Gov­
ernment Presidents. He said that some­
thing must come out from Student Gov­
ernment President and that the presi­
dent must make an effort to better the 
campus.
Gesmond’s Chief of Staff Erik Larson, 
who is second-in-command to Gesmond, 
calls the impeachment a “hypocrisy.”
MCS Senator Shawn Knight said at 
the meeting that sickness cannot be used 
as an excuse for not attending meetings. 
Knight said after the meeting, “Last 
semester, [Gesmond’s] illness took away 
from her the ability to take the time to 
[fulfill her duties]. In a high level posi­
tion, if you know you can’t do your job, 
you should resign. She did not.”
Knight also said that she has not made 
a noticeable effort to get a representa­
tive to Student Senate. “I felt [that her 
impeachment] was very important, and 
it was something worth discussing.” 
“Student Senate should have gotten 
the facts from me first. They did not let 
me explain my side of the story,” 
Gesmond said. “The fact that [Haver­
kamp] made the motion for impeach­
ment without previous discussion leads 
me to believe that he has been planning 
for this.”
“The main problem here is the lack of 
communication between Student Sen­
ate and Student Government,” said 
Gesmond. “I have often approached 
[Haverkamp] about closing the gap be­
tween Student Senate and Student Go v- 
emment.”
She said that she disagrees with 
Haverkamp’s comment that she has not 
talked to him. “He has never contacted 
me since he became Chair of Student 
Senate,” said Gesmond, “yet, I endorsed 
his election for Chair.”

GSO to boycott Colorado grad student conference
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
ByFRyA ICHK ELMRSF
On March 3, the Graduate Student 
Organization (GSO) decided 10-4-2 to 
boycott the National Association of 
Graduate and Professional Students 
(NAGPS) convention in Boul-

GSO, many other universities are also;

“People on this campus are really re­

“I feel that by not going, we’re 
sending a message to Colorado 
that we don’t support this amendment,” 
said GSO president Lara Wolfson.
“I think that everyone felt that the 
amendment was a bad thing. We will not 
support anything that smacks of big­
otry,” said Wolfson.
Amendment 2 to the Colorado State 
Constitution prohibits lesbian, gay, and 
bisexual people from claiming discrimi­

of voters in Colorado. According to a

awareness by doing more acting rather 
than reacting. I’m really surprised that 
more people weren’t interested in the 
amendment,” said Wolfson.
The boycott has been the subject of 
controversy on local CMU bboards, and 
the amendment in general is part of 
nationwide debate.
Other GSO officers were not available 
for comment.

CMU, Chatham College to test joint student Escort service
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
ByFRyA ICHK ELMRSF 
& FRANK MICHELS
ByFRyA NKKMKRyAR ICHK ELMRSF
According to a press release 
from Campus Police, CMU and 
Chatham College will test a con­
solidated Escort service that will 
serve students from both institu­
tions. The test will run from 
March 29 to May 15, and stu­
dents with IDs from either insti­
tution may ride both shuttles.
According to James LaPaglia, 
chief of Campus Police, the idea 
was bom of a discussion between 
University President Robert 
Mehrabian and Chatham Presi­
dent Esther Barazzone in Decem­
ber. “We think that this is the 
first step towards cooperative ef-
forts...notjustbetweenChatham 
and CMU but other institutions,” 
said LaPaglia.
Bill Donahue, director of Pub­
lic Safety at Chatham, said that 
the joint shuttle service “has been 
in the works since the beginning 
of the spring semester.” During 
the trial period, Donahue said, 
“[Chatham and CMU] will see 
how it will work out, and we’ll see 
if the service is being used.” The 
analysis will include time and 
availability, according to Dona­
hue, who said that if the trial run 
is successful, the shuttle will be­
gin in the beginning of the next 
fall semester.
A shuttle already runs between 
Chatham and the University of 
Pittsburgh.
Donahue said that escort driv­
ers will have to be trained in 
recognizing Chatham and Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh identifica­
tion cards.
“LaPaglia and I have been 
working on this very closely," he 
said. “There will be no additional 
costs.” He said that some of the 
issues that will be looked at in­
clude Chatham and CMU’s lim­
ited resources.
The Chatham Escort service 
runs evenings after 5 pm each 
day and is scheduled to stop at 
Skibo, William Pitt Union, Scaife 
Hall at the University of Pitts­
burgh, and Hillman Library in a 
circular route.
According to LaPaglia, CMU 
and Chatham are also consider­
ing sharing resources in other 
fields, such as athletics.

Judge sets no bail for new bombing arrest
NEWARK, NJ, March 12 (AP) — 
Thenewest suspectin the WorldTrade 
Center bombing was denied bail today 
by a federal magistrate after prosecu­
tors said he poses a substantial dan­
ger to society and has ties abroad.
U.S. Magistrate Dennis Cavanaugh 
ordered Nidal A. Ayyad, 25, held with- 
outbail pending removal toNewYork. 
It was not immediately clear when 
that would happen.
Cavanaugh disagreed with defense 
attorney Thomas Higgins’ contention 
that the evidence against his client 
was weak and sketchy.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark 
Matthews argued against any bail for 
Ayyad. “It’s hard to think of a defen­
dant who presents more of a danger 
than this defendant,” Matthews said.
Higgins argued for bail but said he 
would agree to an amount as high as 
$300,000, saying Ayyad’s relatives 
could pledge property to secure that 
amount.
He added that his client could be 
subjected to electronic home monitor­
ing to ensure against flight.
Higgins Baid Ayyad will remain in 
the Union County jail in Elizabeth, 
where federal prisoners in New Jersey 
are held, pending an indictment.
If the government wished to move 
him to New York in the meantime, a 
removal hearing would be required, 
he said.
Before today’s bail hearing, Higgins 
waived an identity hearing, which 
would have required the government 
to prove the defendant is who they say 
he is.
In arguing against bail, Matthews 
reiterated the links the government 
alleges between Ayyad and Moham­
med Salameh of Jersey City, who is 
being held without bail in New York 
on charges he rented the van used to 
bring a bomb into the basement of the 
World Trade Center.
Matthews also said Ayyad, a natu­
ralized American citizen of Palestin­
ian doscent, had traveled to his native 
Kuwait and to Jordan four times since 
coming to the United States in 1985 
and still has family ties in those coun­
tries.
Matthews said the timing of con­
tacts between Ayyad and Salameh 
including telephone calls and thoir 
rental of a car, were significant, com­
ing in the days just beforo the Febru­
ary 26 bombing.
Federal investigators have said
Ayyad and Salameh shared a bank 
account into which tens of thousands 
of dollars were wired from Germany. 
Ayyad is a chemical engineer now sus­
pended from his job with Allied Signal 
Inc., and Salameh allegedly was seen 
several times going into a Jersey City 
storage Bhed where explosives were 
later found.
“We know in that storage shed ex­
isted chemicals which FBI experts said 
were consistent with the bomb,” 
Matthews said.
Higgins Baid the government’s caBe 
against Ayyad is a “compilation of 
inferences piled on one another.”
He said the allegations that Salameh 
had Ayyad’s business card, rented a 
car with him, and made calls from a 
pay phone near the storage shed to 
Ayyad’s work telephone would prove 
nothing more than that they knew 
each other.
Higgins said the government has 
failed to show that those calls were of 
a“criminal,sinisternature,”and ques­
tioned whether Salameh ever actually 
got through to Ayyad at his work num­
ber.
“What the government has proved 
in this complaint is that Mr. Salameh 
and Mr. Ayyad knew each other,” 
Higgins said. “That’s about all.” He 
described his client as having an un­
blemished character.
Higgins said Ayyad worked his way 
through Rutgers University and took 
a $38,000job at Allied Signal immedi­
ately after graduating in 1991.
From that salary, Ayyad supports 
his mother, pregnant wife, and two 
brothers in a Maplewood home that he 
rents for $800 a month, Higgins said.
Salameh and Ayyad are charged 
with aiding in the February 26 bomb­
ing that killed at least five people and 
injured about 1,000.
A third suspect, Ibrahim Elga- 
browny, appeared in federal court in 
New York yesterday evening with civil 
rights attorney William Kunstler seek­
ing bail on charges that he punched 
FBI agents when they came March 4 
to search his Brooklyn, N.Y. apart­
ment. U.S. District Judge John E. 
Sprizzo said he would not reconsider 
another judge denying bail unless 
Kunstler brings new evidence.
The World Trade Center Hotel will 
be closed until the end of summer 
because of repairs to the outside area. 
The entire building should be open by 
April 1, sources said.
New Attorney 
General speaks 
on death penalty
WASHINGTON, March 10 (AP) — 
Attorney General-designate Janet Reno 
said that despite her opposition to capi­
tal punishment, she recognizes the duty 
of prosecutors to seek the death penalty 
for killers who are “totally contemptu­
ous of human life.”
“If the law requires it, if the procedure 
is right, you ask for it,” she said in her 
second day of testimony before the Sen­
ate Judiciary Committee. President Bill 
Clinton today joined other Democrats in 
praising the 54-year-old Miami 
prosecutor’s perform ance before the com­
mittee.
Reno appears headed for quick confir­
mation, accordingto sources. Democrats, 
who were dismayed by the Clinton 
administration’s stumbling search for 
an attorney general, have been all smiles 
over the Reno nomination.
Wary lest some unforeseen problems 
strike Clinton’s second nominee for at­
torney general, Democrats are trying to 
get it over with as quickly as possible. 
The difference this time is that Republi­
cans are joining in.
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the 
committee’s top Republican, told report­
ers it was possible the full Senate could 
confirm Reno this week. “We need her in 
there,” he said.
Federal court 
allows rejection 
of young jurors
SAN FRANCISCO, March 10 (DJ) — 
Prosecutors may block young adults from 
serving as jurors simply because of their 
age, a federal appeals court ruled.
A three-judge panel forthe U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San 
Francisco ruled that a prosecutor may 
exclude young adults from serving as 
jurors without violating their rights or 
the rights of young criminal defendants.
The issue of whether such exclusions 
violate the Constitution has been raised 
increasingly by defense attorneys since 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1986 
that a prosecutor improperly rejected 
jurors in order to systematically exclude 
blacks from the trial of a black defen­
dant. Since then, defense attorneys have 
argued that the so-called Batson deci­
sion should be extended to deny pros­
ecutors the right to bar young jurors 
from serving on the trials of young de­
fendants.
Defense attorneys contend that such 
exclusions violate the rights of young 
people to be treated like everyone else
and the rights of young defendants to a 
fair trial. Federal appeals courts in Bos­
ton and Chicago have rejected such ar­
guments.
The Ninth Circuit cited those federal 
appeals-court decisions in its ruling up­
holding the murder conviction of Wendell 
Pichay of Honolulu, saying “young adults 
do not constitute a cognizable group for 
purposes of an equal protection chal­
lenge to the composition of a ... jury.” 
Thomas Muehleck, assistant U.S. attor­
ney in Honolulu, said youth, along with 
poor education, unemployment, and lack 
of “world experience” were the reasons 
he rejected two jurors under the age of 
23 in the trial of Pichay, who was then 21 
years old.
Rustam A. Barbee, an assistant fed­
eral public defender in Honolulu, said 
young people deserved to be protected 
from systematic exclusion from juries 
because they are full-fledged citizens 
who “vote, pay taxes, and serve in the 
armed forces.” Barbee said his office has 
not decided whether to appeal.
The ruling is filed as ’ete nKe ­CALCii 
gM,pyol U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit, San Francisco, No. 91- 
10571.
Clinton includes 
‘dual use’ plan 
in military cuts
WASHINGTON, March 10 (AP)—The 
centerpiece of President Bill Clinton’s 
short-term plan for helping the economy 
adjust to military cutbacks is $550 mil­
lion to encourage Pentagon contractors 
to develop products that have civilian as 
well as defense uses.
The “dual-use” technology approach is 
part of a package of programs Clinton 
will outline tomorrow. The approximate 
$1.5 billion package will include money 
for communities hurt by military base or 
defense plant closings as well as funds to 
help workers displaced by defense cut­
backs. Clinton will formally unveil the 
package at a Westinghouse plant in 
Baltimore, White House spokesman 
George Stephanopoulos said.
The $1.5 billion was approved by Con­
gress last year but put on indefinite hold 
by the Bush administration. Clinton is 
freeing the money so it can be spent this 
year.
The money is one piece of a broader, 
long-term effort by Clinton to demilita­
rize the economy and end the overwhelm­
ing focus on military uses of technology 
that prevailed during the Cold War era.
Congress has tried for several years to 
increase the pace of this defense “con­
version” and to make the government 
more active in helping workers, compa­
nies, and communities plan adjustments 
before, rather than after, cuts are made.
But Republican administrations have 
argued it is not a proper use of tax 
dollars.
A cornerstone of the administration’s 
short-term approach to defense conver­
sion is the dual-use technology idea. It is 
intended to preserve the middle tier of 
the defense industry—those companies 
notamongthe surviving makers oflarge 
weapons systems that require a dedi­
cated industrial capacity.
The intent is to give medium-size and 
smaller companies the flexibility to move¦ 
more readily between military and com­
mercial work. This would make it easier 
to rebuild a large defense industry should 
the need ever arise.
Storm hits east 
coast, blamed 
for 67 deaths
WASHINGTON, March 14 (AP)—All 
major east coast airports from Boston to 
Atlanta are closed because of a fierce 
winter storm that’s being blamed for at 
least 67 deaths.
The storm hit Florida especially hard, 
causing power outages affecting nearly 
three million customers. Tornadoes 
ripped through 15 counties, winds of up 
to 109 miles per hour blasted the Keys, 
and the panhandle was belted with one 
foot of snow and coastal flooding spread 
along the Gulf beaches.
Airports in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, 
and Harrisburg were closed. Snowfall 
was reported from 18 to 36 inches. Gov­
ernors throughout states in the north­
east have all declared emergencies.
The Federal Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) is sending disaster spe­
cialists to assess damage in areas hurt 
by the storm. Experts have been dis­
patched to Florida as well as the mid- 
Atlantic and northeastern states most 
affected by heavy snowfall and high 
winds. Federal response plans are being 
activated in Massachusetts, Pennsylva­
nia, New Jersey, and Georgia.
President Bill Clinton told reporters 
at the White House that he has been 
discussing the government’s response to 
the storm, and that FEMA is in touch 
with officials in every involved state.
According to meteorological reports, 
the storm is the result of arctic air from 
Canada mixing with moist, warm air 
from the low-pressure system over the 
GulfofMexico, duetoa strongjetstream. 
The resulting storm is drawing more 
strength as it travels northward and 
encounters warm Atlantic waters.

Correction...
In last week’s story, “Senate to hold student organization 
budget hearings,” the UEA’s budget’s needs were 
mischaracterized. Its budget was for general operations. Also, 
the donation schedule for WRCT was misstated. The radio 
station has already received the first of its donations.
Futhermore, two subsidy proposals were misstated in the 
F&R budget packet referenced in the page 5 sidebar, “Budget 
Subsidies from F&R Committee Budget Packet." Amnesty 
International’s suggested subsidy should read $340, and Spirit’s 
subsidy should read $4793.

UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS WHERE 
PEOPLE ARE PUTTING 
TOO MANY RETIREMENT DOLLARS.
Every year, a lot of people make a 
huge mistake on their taxes.They 
don't take advantage of tax deferral and 
wind up sending Uncle Sam money they 
could be saving for retirement.
Fortunately, that's a mistake you can 
easily avoid with TIAA-CREF SRAs. 
SRAs not only ease your current tax- 
bite, they offer a remarkably easy way 
to build retirement income—especially 
for the "extras” that your regular pension 
and Social Security benefits may not 
cover. Because your contributions are 
made in before-tax dollars, you pay less 
taxes now. And since all earnings on 
your SRA are tax-deferred as well, the
money you don't send to Washington 
works even harder for you. Down the 
road, that can make a dramatic difference 
in your quality of life.
What else makes SRAs so special?
A range of allocation choices—from the 
guaranteed security of TIAA to the 
diversified investment accounts of 
CREF's variable annuity—all backed 
by the nation's number one retirement 
system.
Why write off the chance for a more 
rewarding retirement? Call today and 
learn more about how TIAA-CREF 
SRAs can help you enjoy many 
happy returns.
Benefit now from tax deferral. Call our SRA hotline 1 800-842-2733, ext. 8016.

7:46 am. A CMU student reported 
that three BB’s were fired at her 
apartment window during the

ficers observed a woman walking

pm. A CMU student called Cam­
pus Police after discovering that 
the skin around a cut on his foot
had turned green. The student 
had stepped on a piece of glass 
the previous day, treated the in­
jury and decided that there was 
no need for medical attention. He 
was taken to Presbyterian ER.
3/8 ARREST, 11:59 pm. Cam­
pus Police apprehended and ar­
rested a trespasser in Hunt Li­
brary who was seen rummaging

Gesmond said she has heard 
the accusations about not attend­
ing meetings from Student Sena­
tors. She said, “In every meeting, 
I have either sent an alternate or 
have obtained the minutes and 
reviewed them."
CIT Senator Rob Evans was 
one of the three Senators who 
voted against Gesmond's im­
peachment. He said that there is 
no purpose of removing her now 
because it leaves no time for the 
president to do anything. “I feel 
that a stunt is being pulled for 
Senate to gain more notoriety,” 
said Evans. “I will wait to see 
what she has to say.”
CFA Senator Michel Robe 
agreed. He said that the impeach­
ment occurs at an “inappropriate 
time.” “This is way too far into 
the year,” said Robe. He said that 
if Senate was to impeach Ges­
mond, they should have at the 
end of last semester or the begin­
ning of this semester.
CFA Senator Jim Albert also 
voted against the impeachment 
of the Student Government Presi­
dent. “I feel that the impeach­
ment process should be the last 
step when nothing else is work­
ing. There are more constructive 
things we can do before impeach-

ment.” Albert was disappointed 
with the results of the proposal 
because according to him, “[Stu­
dent Senate] never heard 
[Gesmond's] side of the story.” 
Haverkamp said that ho has 
been thinking about the impeach­
ment proposal for the last two 
weeks. “Last semester,” he said, 
“the Executive Committee dis­
cussed it but not very seriously.” 
He said that before the proposal, 
he had discussed the matter with 
Campus Affairs Committee Chair 
Burt Holzman and Funding & 
Recognition Chair Dave Martin. 
Haverkamp admitted that he had 
not contacted Gesmond about her 
impeachment.
Larson said, “It’s ironic that 
[Haverkamp] accuses [Gesmond] 
of violating bylaws, yet he has 
not validated petitions [for va­
cancies]. It seems that the presi­
dent has to follow the bylaws 
more closely than the chair of 
Student Senate.”
“Student Government does not
have a problem with helping stu­
dents, yet Student Senate can’t 
fill their own seats," Gesmond 
said. “I have felt a lot of frustra­
tion with cortnin Senators who 
aro inablo to be flexiblo.” 
“Senate does care what has 
happened,” said Haverkamp. “We 
want to make sure future [presi­
dents] are expected to perform.... 
We did not single out [Gesmond] 
just to show that we had some 
muscle.”
Haverkamp also said that next 
year’s Student Government 
Presidentneeds to know thatStu- 
dent Senate is watching. “The 
Student Government President 
should be the most respected per­
son on campus.”
According to the bylaws, the 
line of succession after Student 
Government President is the 
chair of Student Senate, followed 
by Senate’s committee chairs. 
Neither the chair of Student Sen­
ate nor the committee chairs was 
interested in the position.

FORUM
Senate impeachment 
of Gesmond necessary
On Thursday, Student Sen­
ate voted to impeach Student 
Government President Natalie 
Gesmond after a motion from 
Chair of Student Senate Greg 
Haverkamp.
We have seen little from 
Gesmond in terms of ideas or 
action, and agree with the im­
peachment. We encourage 
Senators to think hard about 
what Gesmond has and has not 
done prior to the removal pro­
cess. We also encourage con­
stituents to speak with their 
Senators and Gesmond about 
their feelings on the matter.
During the discussion of his 
motion, Haverkamp cited pre­
vious troubles contacting 
Gesmond. We hope that he did 
not allow past experience to in­
terfere with his responsibility 
to warn Gesmond that she would 
have to defend herself. He 
should make it known to his 
fellow Senators that he did not 
try to warn her.
However, Haverkamp also 
cited absence from Senate meet­
ings as a reason for impeach­
ment. Gesmond should have 
been at the meeting regardless 
of notification.
It would be responsible for 
Senate to attempt to work out 
its problems with Gesmond. 
This attempt should have been 
made by Senate as a whole, not
just the Chair, before impeach­
ment. It can still be attempted 
before removal is discussed. If, 
after discussion with Gesmond, 
Senate feels that she is not re­
sponding adequately, it could 
ask for her resignation before 
discussion of her removal. If she 
refuses, Senate can than vote 
on her removal based on more 
than a perception of negligence 
of duty.
Granted, there have been ex­
tenuating circumstances that 
made it difficult for Gesmond to 
fulfill all her requirements as 
set forth by the bylaws. How­
ever, the circumstances existed 
well before her campaign and 
election, and Gesmond should 
have considered them before she 
decided to run for Student Gov­
ernment President.
Gesmond has not fulfilled the 
duties of president and should 
be removed. It is important for 
the Student Government Presi­
dent to be visible and active in 
the primary student legislative 
body. Gesmond has not been. 
Senate sends with this impeach­
ment the message to the stu­
dent body that the president 
should produce ideas that im­
prove life for the students and a 
message to Gesmond that she 
has not fulfilled this require­
ment.
We concur.GSO justified in its 
boycott of Colorado
Last week, the Graduate Stu­
dent Organization (GSO) voted 
10-4-2 in favor of boycotting the 
National Association for Gradu­
ate & Professional Students 
(NAGPS) national meeting that 
is being held in Boulder, Colo­
rado. They cite Colorado 
Amendment 2, which prohibits 
the establishment of minority 
status for gays, lesbians, and 
bisexuals, as their reason for 
the boycott. By boycotting the 
meeting, GSO wishes to convey 
its disagreement with the legis­
lated discrimination ofColorado 
Amendment 2.
We agree with GSO’s position
on this matter. The passage of 
Amendment 2 is a reprehen­
sible, indefensible act that pro­
motes discrimination against a 
minority, and leaves the vic­
tims of discrimination no legal 
recourse. The fact that it will 
not be tolerated must be com­
municated clearly and quickly 
to Colorado’s lawmakers. The 
boycott is a proven method. It 
sends a message to other states 
considering similar legislation 
that this denial of rights will 
not be tolerated. We commend 
GSO for taking such a strong 
stand on this controversial is-
GSO’s boycott unjustified
[Ed. note: Below is a dissent­
ing opinion. The dissent is an 
opportunity for members of The 
Tartan’s Editorial Board to dis­
agree with the majority opinion 
stated in the above editorial. It 
is signed by the dissenting board 
members.]
While boycotting NAGPS in 
protest of Colorado Amendment 
2 might seem like a good idea, 
we feel that there are much more 
effective ways of demonstrat­
ing for gay, lesbian, and bisexual 
rights and against the amend­
ment.
We understand the philoso­
phy behind the boycott — not 
contributing economically to the 
state of Colorado until the 
amendment is repealed — but 
feel that other actions, both in

GSO protests national 
conference in Colorado

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
As president of 
Carnegie Mellon’s 
Graduate Student Or­
ganization (GSO), I 
want to explain to the 
campus community why CMU will not 
be represented at the National Associa­
tion of Graduate and Professional Stu­
dents (NAGPS) conference being held 
April 1- 4 in Boulder, Colorado.
In November, a majority of the voters 
of Colorado voted to add Amendment 2 
to their state constitution which prohib­
its lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals from 
making claims of discrimination. The 
passage of Amendment 2 has spawned a 
boycott of the state, which many confer­
ences (e.g. the U.S. Conference of May­
ors), cities (New York, Atlanta, Phila­
delphia, CR yi”l and celebrities (e.g. 
Whoopi Goldberg and Barbara Streis­
and) have joined. Despite the boycott, 
NAGPS decided to continue with the 
conference in Boulder; however, many 
universities are boycotting the NAGPS 
conference, and a teleconference is be­
ing arranged for those schools.
Following an hour discussion and nu­
merous bboard posts, the CMU GSO 
voted to boycott the NAGPS conference. 
In addition to having moral objections to 
attending the conference, many repre­
sentatives felt the GSO should set an 
example to the campus community: big­
otry against any group will not be toler­
ated.
This decision by GSO was reached
over a week ago; and the debate over it 
lasted several weeks. Despite this, how­
ever, it appears that The Tartan does 
not consider the Colorado amendment, 
the gay and lesbian community on this 
campus, or the actions of graduate stu­
dents to be a newsworthy issue. Both the 
GSO meeting on Wednesday, March 3, 
and the issue under discussion were 
well publicized, and I am appalled that 
The Tartan could so blatantly ignore 
such an important topic on this campus.
Our next meetingis Wednesday, April 
7.1 hope that The Tartan is enlightened 
enough by that time to consider the 
graduate students of this campus news­
worthy.

Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
I am writing to com­
plain about the poor 
service I experienced 
last Thursday with 
escort van. At approxi­
mately 10:15 pm, I called and made a 
request to be picked up at Hamerschlag 
Hall. The dispatcher requested my name 
and number, and I asked when I should 
expect a call. I was told they were ex­
pecting the driver in about 15 to 20 
minutes. Knowing that there is a bit of 
variability in the time, I waited until 
10:45 pm before I called again. I spoke 
with the same dispatcher, and he stated
he expected the driver in about 10 min­
utes.By 11 pm I was contemplating that 
I would have been home if I had started 
walking at 10:15 pm. I called at 11:05 
pm, and to my surprise I was talking to 
a new dispatcher who tells me that the 
van left five minutes ago. Needless to 
say, I was not pleased and very frus­
trated. He claimed that he didn’t know 
about my request and then shuffled a 
few papers and found my request. He 
asked if I still wanted to be picked up. In 
response I declined a pick-up as I de­
cided to take a taxi home; I could not 
wait any longer. Also I asked to whom I 
could register a complaint and was told 
to direct my complaint to you.
In the past I have used the escort van 
by both walking over to Skibo and re- 
questinga pick-up at Hamerschlag Hall. 
While I have experienced long wait times 
in the past, the suggestion last night 
that I wait even more time after the 
dispatcher had forgottenmy request was 
inexcusable. One would think thatwhen 
there is a change of dispatchers that 
requests for pick-up at other buildings 
(such as mine) would be forwarded to 
the new dispatcher. I took a taxi home 
which cost me $7, not something I would 
like to repeat because of someone else’s 
forgetfulness.

the state.
Go to Colorado and protest 
there, where it will make the 
news and make people think.
Work with people in cities like 
Denver and Aspen, where equal 
rights ordinances were already 
in effect, instead of punishing 
them economically.
GSO deserves a great deal of 
respect for making difficult de­
cision to stay away from the 
NAGPS meeting in Denver.
But we would prefer to see 
representatives attend and take 
a public stand at the site of the 
debate rather than just stay 
away.
Create a presence while the 
amendment is still in legisla­
tive limbo — this is no time for 
a boycott.

THETARTANAnti-choice tactics include murder
_______Jason A. Specland
For many years I have sup­
ported the effort to keep abortion 
a legal and safe alternative for 
those who desire to end an un­
wanted pregnancy. I wore the 
pins, attended a rally or two, but 
I never became very involved. 
Maybe I thought, “Hey, it’s legal 
now. Why bother?” Something 
took place though, last Wednes­
day in Pensacola, Florida, that 
has altered my opinion forever.
Dr. David Gunn provided ser­
vices at several abortion clinics 
in Alabama, Georgia, andFlorida. 
Last Wednesday, several mem­
bers of the anti-choice (I refuse to 
dignify them with such lofty 
names as “pro-life” or even “anti­
abortion”) group “Rescue Amer­
ica” were protesting outside one 
of these clinics. When Gunn got 
out of his car, one of the protest­
ers, Michael F. Griffin, shot him 
dead with a .38 caliber revolver.
For those who don’t know, since 
the Supreme Court’snKe ­yLC 
decision 25 years ago, abortion 
has been legal in this country. In 
other words, a man was brutally 
murdered for performing a legal 
activity in his own office. In my
opinion, this should be con­
demned by all members of this 
society.
Themostdisgustingpartofthis 
whole ordeal is not the shooting 
itself. There will always be fanat­
ics on any side of an issue who see 
fit to take the law into their own 
hands. The truly disgusting side 
of this story is the reaction of 
anti-choice groups around the 
nation. Randall Terry of Opera­
tion Rescue, as expected, con­
demned the killing as an “inap­
propriate, repulsive act.” The 
more telling opinions, however, 
come from local chapters of these 
large organizations and smaller 
anti-choice groups around the 
nation. One quote that sticks in 
my belly is one from Donald Spitz, 
an Operation Rescue field direc­
tor. “That abortionist was in the 
trade of bloodshed,” he said. “He 
reaped what he sowed. From 
God’s perspective, he deserved 
it.”
When I first read this story, I 
was, for a brief moment, relieved 
to know that the anti-choice 
groups might have a little bit of 
compassion and intelligence in 
this situation. “Rescue America,” 
it said, “is raising funds for the 
family... ” I was shocked when I 
found the rest of the sentence 
read, “... of Michael Griffin.” Ap­
parently, the anti-choicers believe 
they are above the law.
I then went on to read some of
the terrorist tactics used by some 
of these groups. I was aware of 
the intimidation and harassment 
perpetrated by these people out­
side of clinics, but, as it turns out, 
they do so much more. Gunn was 
featured in a “wanted” poster, 
distributed by Terry and Opera­
tion Rescue. This poster contained 
not only his photograph but also 
his phone number and other iden-
used.
A doctor in South Dakota was 
threatened in his own home by 
an armed man for performing 
abortions. Doctors who assist 
women in utilizing their right to 
choose abortion are now running 
frantic, purchasing bullet-proof 
vests and employing off-duty po­
lice officers and guard dogs.
The anti-choice movement has
They’re terrorists, trained in the art 
of harassment and intimidation, who 
will stop at nothing to overturn the 
law of the land and deny women their 
right to choose an abortion.
tification, apparently to facilitate 
harassment. Operation Rescue 
also has a 12-week training ses­
sion, instructing students to fol­
low doctors and patients home 
from abortion clinics, uncover 
personal information about their 
targets, and plan demonstrations 
in the workers’ neighborhoods.
That’s just the legal part, 
though. Harassment, by phone 
and through mail, is common. 
Two doctors at a family planning 
clinic in Melbourne, Florida, re­
signed after bomb and death 
threats. Chemical warfare, in 
which foul smelling chemicals are 
sprayed at abortion clinics, is also
takena dangerous new turn. They 
have proven in the past that they 
have no respect for property rights 
or the law of the land. Now, in not 
condemning Griffin immedi ately, 
they have shown that (ironically 
enough) they have no respect for 
human life, either.
They’ve lost the Supreme Court 
battle. Even the past 12 years of 
conservative nominations to the 
Supreme Court have failed to 
overturn vSC nKe ­yLCe A new 
conservative justice won’t come 
to the court for at least another 
four years, and probably much 
longer. By that time, vSC nKe ­yLC 
will be such a defended and long
standing precedent that even the 
most conservative justices on the 
Court will be loathe to overturn it 
entirely.
They’re also losing the congres­
sional battle. With a Democratic 
majority in the House and the 
Senate, both the Freedom of 
Choice Act and the Freedom of 
Access to Clinic Entrances Act 
will likely pass, making vSC nKe 
­yLC the law of the land.
Their only weapon now appears 
to be terrorism, both mental and 
physical, against those seeking 
to exercise their legal right to 
choose. A man has been killed for 
performing a legal service in the 
privacy of his office.
Perhaps Gunn hasn’t died in 
vain. Hopefully, moderate pro- 
choicers like myself will finally 
see what we’re up against. They’re 
not just chanting protesters any­
more. They’re terrorists, trained 
in the art of harassment and in­
timidation, who will stop at noth­
ing to overturn the law of the 
land and deny women their right 
to choose an abortion.
Maybe by exposing the true 
nature of the anti-choice move­
ment, Gunn’s death will allow 
the pro-choice movement to rally 
its support among the all-too si­
lent majority.

Christian M. Restifo
Two weeks ago, the Graduate Student 
Organization (GSO) voted 10 — 4 — 2 in 
favor of boycotting the National Associa­
tion of Graduate and Professional Stu­
dents (NAGPS) conference that will take 
place the first week of April in Colorado.
GSO’s reasoning for this decision is 
Amendment 2. This piece of legislature, 
supported by 53 percent of the voters in 
Colorado, would amend the state consti­
tution so that homosexuality could not be 
claimed as a minority status in such mat­
ters as civil rights and discrimination 
suits. I strongly support GSO and feel 
they have added their voice to a growing 
number of people who will not tolerate 
such bigotry. They’re showing their anger 
by boycotting Colorado.
These voices are not merely a few gradu­
ate student groups and universities. The 
American Public Health Association has 
decided not to hold a conference in Colo­
rado. Ziff-Davis Publishing Company, a 
subsidiary of ZiffNet Communications, 
has already slowed down on its planned 
movement of over one thousand employ­
ees from the east coast to Denver. The Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power 
even dropped Infinite Energy, a consult­
ing firm, because it is based in Colorado.
Several cities and many other organiza­
tions are cancelling or have canceled con­
ventions, relocations, and other plans be­
cause of Amendment 2. The estimated
damage, only $25 million, comprises only 
a small part of the $75 billion economy of 
the state. But all the pullouts and debates 
have business and civic leaders doing what 
they should have done from the beginning
— conduct an all-out effort to remove or 
change Amendment 2.
Amendment 2 was touted as a law that 
would prevent “special rights” such as 
quotas, affirmative action programs, etc. 
to gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. This 
seems harmless enough. I have been, and 
always will be, a strong, vocal opponent of 
such programs and laws. However, it’s 
one little sentence that makes Amend­
ment 2 dangerous. Basically, minority 
status cannot be claimed if you’re gay. In 
other words, if you’re fired, denied hous­
ing, or other such things because you’re
Quark, Inc., a computer software com­
pany, went one step further. It issued a 
notice to all of its 50 suppliers that if they 
did not show that they adopted non-dis­
crimination policies, they would be 
dropped. One company refused. Quark, 
Inc. no longer orders from it.
This boycott is having quite an effect. It 
has caused such discussion and contro­
versy that a possible solution has surfaced 
to this whole issue. Greg Walta, a lawyer 
in Colorado Springs, has come up with a 
proposed amendment that would prohibit 
“special rights” but still outlaw discrimi­
nation against gays, lesbians, and bisexu­
als.
As can be expected, the supporters of 
Amendment 2, namely Colorado for Fam­
ily Values (CFV), oppose it. It should come
If, in the larger scheme of things, we can show 
to all states that they will suffer the economic 
wrath of people who support equal rights, 
maybe voters will think twice.
gay, you have no legal recourse.
The actions taken by groups that in­
clude GSO may put an end to that. While 
the economic damage may be small, the 
taint to the state’s reputation stings the 
most. Business leaders, normally quiet on 
such public matters, are taking a stand. 
For example, several businesses have come 
together to form the Colorado Alliance for 
RestoringEquality(CARE). CARE’s main 
goal is the removal or change of Amend­
ment 2. Many companies are adopting 
non-discrimination policies that include 
sexual orientation.
as no surprise, however. Their opposition 
shows that despite their smoke-filled “no. 
special rights” campaign, they still seek to 
deny rights that we all should have.
Some people are opposed to the boycott. 
They argue that cities such as Denver and 
Aspen, which already had anti-discrimi­
nation laws, are being unfairly hurt. While 
I sympathize and believe that they yFC 
being hurt, I am still in support, of the 
boycott. The reason is that Colorado is 
only the beginning.
People in Arizona, California, Ohio, and 
Michigan are interested in using Amend­
ment 2 as a guide for legislation in their 
own states. The Traditional Values Coali­
tion currently has 30 states under review 
as potential breeding grouds for similarly 
bigoted and hate-filled groups. I’m sure 
they’ll have luck. Anthony Martin, a pos­
sible candidate for governor of Florida, 
thinks any boycott that would result would 
be good. “The boycott could be good for 
Florida, where we have population over­
growth,” he said. “And for health reasons, 
it may be good.” Martin said he was refer­
ring to gay men with AIDS.
These reasons are justification enough 
to maintain a boycott on Colorado. If, in 
the larger scheme of things, we can show 
to all states that they will suffer the eco­
nomic wrath of people who support equal 
rights, maybe voters will think twice. 
Maybe debate and discussion will help to 
amend the proposals so that they still 
provide equal rights. Maybe the mere in­
ternal friction within communities will 
provide a deterrent of such effect that 
proposals never even make it to the ballot.
As long as religious fanatics and igno­
rant bigots keep the push on, groups like 
GSO qGKR boycott their states, cities, and 
municipalities. Such treatment will force 
complacent voters to keep control out of 
the hands of such people.
And the results aren’t all that bad. Those 
companies that do willfully adopt non­
discrimination policies can tout them to 
outside businesses. It’s actually a strange 
twist if you think about it. Amendment 2, 
designed to prevent anti-discrimination 
laws, has actually forced companies to 
adopt them.

What do you think of 
Clinton’s plan?
“I think it’s a good idea be­
cause some people would rather 
work it than pay it out of their 
paycheck. They need some time 
to rest after college.”
“I think it’s an excellent idea, 
because people need to start 
thinking more about the com­
munity. I plan to teach for at 
least five years, give a little back 
to the community, especially the 
African-American community.”
“I think it's a good opportu­
nity for people who wouldn't 
have the resources. I also think 
it’s a good incentive to stay in 
college, because it promises a 
job in the future.”
“I think it’s a good idea be­
cause it allows just about any­
body to get aid for college. It 
gives you a chance to choose 
something you can use in a ca­
reer.”

“I wondered what he saw. I’ve been 
thinking about that. And I realized he 
was looking at my legs. He was looking 
at my thighs. He was looking at my ass. 
He was looking at my mouth, my 
ankles.... That’s all he saw.” — Maria

' Sexual harassment. The term is
- thrown around a lot these days but the 
¡meaning is still pretty unclear to most 
; people. Maybe Terry and Jennifer’s story 
-will help.
: Terry and Jennifer are students herfe 
at CMU. They have a co-worker, a man,
; who, by their standards, has been sexu­
ally harassing them. Terry called me 
•and asked me if I would write a story 
; about what was happening to her. I 
•agreed. This is what they had to say:

Terry (T): “It’s a feeling of powerless­
ness ... anger arises because I shouldn’t 
have to deal with this, especially at a 
workplace, but I don’t want this to be 
about just the workplace. I shouldn’t 
have to deal with it 
ever. I shouldn’t have 
to expect this type of 
behavior because I’m 
a woman. Another 
male was offended by 
it too.... I’m scared to 
see him on campus.
At night. It scares 
me, he has my phone 
number. To have 
those comments made to me by someone 
I don’t know that well, or trust, it’s 
scary. They [men] don’t understand the 
fear we live with every day. I felt in­
vaded.”

T: “Oh, not by him. But I know it’s 
going to happen again so many times.... 
He kept saying he couldn’t understand 
why I got so offended by it. It’s this 
feeling I get in my stomach. I just 
shouldn’t be treated as a sexual little 
chick.”

Jennifer (J): "When it happened to me 
it was an instant angry reaction. He was 
setting an example for the rest of the 
guys.... When I talked to him, he didn’t 
seem to understand the concept that it 
wasn’t a compliment. Powerless. He 
doesn’t give us any respect.”
T: “Oh yes, I’m a lesser human being 
because I don’t have a penis.”

J: “I guess he’s kinda pissed because 
he doesn’t understand why we’re mak­
ing a big deal out of nothing. Because he 
stopped doing it to me....”
What he actually did is relatively un­
important. Whether or not it was sexual 
harassment by le­
gal standards is not 
the point. What is 
the point is that too 
many men think 
that they can dis­
regard our feelings 
just because they 
have a few female 
friends who don’t 
mind being called 
“honey.” It’s like making a racist joke 
and then saying “Oh, it’s O.K., some of 
my best friends are black.”
What you have got to understand is 
that right now women are scared. We 
are in vulnerable positions. We know 
that every two of three women will be 
sexually assaulted at least once in their 
lifetime. We know that campuses are 
teeming with bad things just waiting to 
happen. So, if some of us are a little 
paranoid, well, who can blame us?
Powerless, invaded, scared. Do you 
have any right to make someone feel
these things? No. If what you say, either 
in passing or on a consistant basis, makes 
someone feel scared and intimidated 
then you are guilty of harassment. I 
think most men just don’t realize the 
feelings that they evoke with the things 
they say. Sexual inuendos, lustful looks, 
and names like “chick” and “honey” are 
all things that make us feel like less of a 
person. You may think they are no big 
deal but when you hear them every day 
all your life they do start to make you 
feel like less of a person. It’s these things 
that we have been taught to learn to live 
with that make it so hard to speak out 
when we are assaulted and raped or 
discriminated against. It’s these little 
things that make it so hard to get a 
rapist convicted. It’s these little things 
we are taught since childhood that make 
it so hard to get decent salaries and to 
not get ripped off at the mechanics. So, 
the next time you think about whistling 
at some chick walking by, just remem­
ber you are continuing the cycle of abuse 
and discrimination. With your under­
standing and consideration though, 
maybe it will get better.

Erik Witte
I’m still not done griping about 
the election. Only when you get 
two completely horrible candi­
dates for President can you wind 
'lip with a campaign as ugly and 
; deceitful as the one we just had. 
Bill Clinton won by distorting
• and misrepresenting economic 
^ facts, by lying, and by effectively 
; using the press’s blatant favorit­
ism. One could credit him for run- 
;ningan effective campaign. With 
a little help from a biased media, 
he successfully kept the discus­
sion away from his shady charac­
ter, his wife’s radical past and 
present, his marital infidelity, his 
I lack of foreign affairs experience
• (although he has won my support 
in this area), and the fact that
! Arkansas was in shambles. For- 
, tunately for Clinton, the election 
had nothing to do with him.
From the moment campaign- 
; ing really began, the only thing 
that determined whether or not 
; George Bush would continue as 
President or not was Bush him­
self. Unfortunately, the now ex- 
, President ran an incompetent 
campaign and just generally 
couldn’t force discussion onto his 
:strong points. An expert diplo­
mat and genius in foreign affairs, 
! Bush really was lacking when it 
came to being a good President.
; He broke his own pledge to not 
. raise taxes while compromising 
; with a Democratic Congress and
accomplished several things in 
the process. First, he turned what 
had been a minor economic slow­
down into a recession. Second, he 
turned his back on the Reagan 
policies that had created the long­
est and largest peacetime eco­
nomic expansion in our country’s 
history. Last, he virtually guar­
anteed that he would be a one- 
term President. Clinton knew 
this. All he had to do was not 
screw anything up.
Clinton’s handlers, however, 
must have felt that that was not
competitive, and that overall, 
they were being paid less than 
they had been, as compared to 
other industrial nations.
Too bad none of it is true. We 
lead the world in import pur­
chases and export sales. We have 
the highest per capita purchas­
ing power in the world by far — 
45 percent better than Germany, 
our closest competitor. We also 
have the healthiest economy in 
the world, better than both Ger­
many and Japan. In the third 
and fourth quarters of1992, both
Clinton and the Democrats would like 
you to believe that his economic plan 
is necessary. That way, he can take 
all the credit for the natural upturn of 
the economy.
enough. They decided that they 
should run a campaign focused 
on the economy alone since that 
was Bush’s main weakness. Un­
fortunately, the economy was not 
in bad shape. So they had to dis­
tort truths and blatantly lie to 
win. During the third quarter of 
1992, the economy grew at 3.4 
percent, and it continued at that 
rate through the fourth quarter. 
While this is modest, it is proof 
that the US economy, by far the 
strongest in the world, was re­
covering from the 1990 budget 
compromise.
Clinton based his campaign on 
a few main points, among them: 
he said that American industry 
couldn’t compete in world mar­
kets, that our workers weren’t
of their economies shrank, while 
ours expanded four percent.
Clinton’s statements about 
American productivity were also 
false. According to a McKinsey 
and Company study conducted 
with the stalwart Democrat 
economist Robert Solow, an MIT 
Nobel Laureate, the average an­
nual output of an American 
worker was $49,600 as compared 
to $44,200 in Germany, the next 
closest.
According to this study, there 
was only one main reason the 
United States has the strongest 
economy in the world—competi­
tion fostered by laissez-faire poli­
cies. You won’t see anyone sup­
porting these successful policies 
in Clinton’s administration. (As
his “soak the rich” tax increases 
show, Clinton despises anything 
and anyone successful.) He has 
filled his cabinet with big-gov- 
ernment regulators. Frederico 
Pena, the transportation secre­
tary, is opposed to airline and 
trucking deregulation. Laura 
Tyson, Clinton’s choice to head 
the Council of Economic Advi­
sors, will likely be the first per­
son to hold that job who is not 
fully in favor of free trade. The 
list goes on and on.
Clinton and the Democrats 
would like you to believe that his 
economic plan is necessary. That 
way, he can take all the credit for 
the natural upturn of the 
economy. The Presidency is a 
volatile position. The President 
gets the credit for everything good 
that happens during his or her 
administration, as well as taking 
the blame for everything that goes 
wrong.
When Clinton’s tax hikes and 
spending increases kill our 
economy, we can only hope he is 
still in office to take the blame.

So it always snows in Pitts­
burgh. I think that as a CMU 
student coming from the rainy 
.area of suburban Philadelphia, I 
have learned to deal with it.
: Saturday wasn't so bad. The 
only things we had to doal with 
being closed were Entropy, co-op, 
: and the art store. But this was all 
understandable. I mean, after all, 
there was a blizzard of some sort 
’ going on outside.
Then there was Sunday. After 
working my way towards The 
Tartan office, I was sort of look­
ing forward to getting a dough­
nut, some hot cocoa, and maybe 
some orange juice for breakfast
from Salads Plus. Ha! Little did I 
know that Dining Services would 
not open Salads Plus.
Considering the number of 
people on-campus, I fail to see 
how they planned on feeding us 
on whatever is left in Highlander’s 
“vault o’ food.” So what have we 
got left? No co-op, no Entropy, no 
art store, no Salads Plus, no Tar­
tan Grill, no Taco Bell (only the 
Corner oven was open), and of 
course, no library. Nah, I didn’t 
need to research artists for that 
project that I needed art supplies 
for anyway. Who needs it, right?
It’s not like we live in Califor­
nia and had just suddenly got a 
freak snowstorm that we weren’t 
prepared for. This is Pittsburgh. 
I think that campus services 
should worry a bit more about 
doing what they’re supposed to 
do: servo the campus. But it seems 
like the whole “services" part of 
their title seemed to go out the 
window just when it was going to 
be hard.
Of course, we’re going to have 
to deal with inconveniences when 
a blizzard hits. But the roads are 
clear, the sun is out, and stu­
dents are playing in the snow. So 
why are all the people who should 
be doingtheir jobs sitting at home, 
nice and comfy, with their stocked
up fridges, close-by stoves, and 
shovelled sidewalks? I certainly 
have no clue, because I had to 
trudge through two feet of snow, 
wait in a line for 10-15 minutes 
for soggy french toast, and mooch 
art supplies off friends so I could 
get my work done and keep my­
self functioning.

Academics need credit
Mw2CI-NoqE gb­s LRSF :
our desires for spoon-fed news. 
This disdain of intelligence and 
education strikes at more than 
ourtechnologicalleadership, al­
ready under heavy attack. It 
erodes the base of democracy 
itself!
Only an educated, thinking 
public can make well-informed 
decisions about the issues fac­
ing us today. Ignorance can far 
too easily be turned into fear 
and hatred. These emotions can 
be manipulated by those in 
power, or those who want power, 
to change behavior to their de­
sires. More than one dictator 
has started out by preying on 
the ignorance of his followers.
The bumper stickers are a ten­
tative first step to restoring 
pride in education and intelli­
gence, but we need more. Tele­
vise the Nobel Prize ceremony.
Have on-the-air recognition of 
outstanding students of all 
kinds, not 4GKR athletes. Fund 
advanced programs for gifted 
children, elevate excellence in 
academics as a goal that ex­
ceeds sports victories. And rec­
ognize teachers for what they 
are: custodians of tomorrow’s 
great men and women.
Learning is hard. Thought is 
hard. If straight-Astudents had 
the prestige currently reserved 
for sports players, there would 
be more students with straight 
As. Above all else, we must pass 
on to others that intelligence 
and education are not things to 
hide shamefully, but that they 
are the worthiest of attributes, 
surpassing gold medals, cham­
pionships, and fame.

SPORTS
Snowed in 
with ESPN
A blizzard last Saturday could only 
mean one thing. Pull up a couch, grab 
the remote, and prepare for an orgy of 
sports.
Thanks to cable television, there were;
* 15 college basketball games (March 
Madness!?)
* Penguins vs. Islanders hockey game
* Nets vs. Suns basketball game
* Marlins vs. Mets baseball game
* Florida vs. Miami college baseball
* PBA Bowling Tournament
* PGA Golf Tournament
* Figure Skating World Champion­
ships
* Swimming andDivingBiglOCham- 
pionships
No sooner had I put the TV Guide 
down, than I began to panic. At 1:30 pm, 
there would be five games going on at 
the same time. How can one choose be­
tween the Big East, the ACC, figure 
skating, swimming and diving, and the 
Marlins-Mets game? Five events, one 
TV. It was the end of the sportsworld as 
I knew it.
The VCR!! Yes, it would save my san­
ity. I could tape one program, but what 
about the other three?
I pounded on my neighbor’s door and 
pleaded for her television. Luckily, with­
out much of a straggle, she obliged. One 
sports related homicide averted.
I ran downstairs to confront the fam­
ily with two young children.
“Give me your television!” I demanded. 
The Teenage Mutant Ninj a Turtles were 
flyingacross theirTV screen eatingpizza.
“No, no Mommy. Don’t let that bad 
man take our TV away!” the children 
screamed, attacking me from all sides 
with their numchucks and karate kicks, 
but I would not be denied. Their TV was 
one of the missing pieces to my utopian 
puzzle, and I would have it.
I still needed one more set. In a flash, 
I remembered the little old seven-inch 
black and white in the closet, which the 
last tenants left behind. The picture was 
fuzzy, and the sound was a little shaky, 
but it had to do.
The four televisions and VCR were 
lined up in front of the couch. Every­
thing was hooked up and ready to go.
Now to prioritize my viewing sched­
ule. The black and white would get the 
figure skating, to be followed by the 
bowling and golf. That was easy. The 
Marlins—Mets game would be taped, to 
be viewed at halftime during the college 
basketball. The remote control would 
work wonders in speeding up the three- 
hour game.
The swimming and diving went on the 
12” color, the Big East on the 15'' color 
from next door, and the ACC matchup 
on the 24" color, which only minutes 
before had mutant turtles running 
through sewers on it.
I quickly moved the fridge into the 
living room within reach of the couch, 
and whipped up a big chocolate milk, got 
a bag of Oreos cookies, and prepared 
myself for sheer enjoyment.
At 1:30 pm, all five games were in 
progress.
The marathon had started. Twenty- 
three sports events. Then came the ter­
rible news. Five games were cancelled 
due to the storm, there was a 29 minute 
power outage delay at the ACC tourna­
ment, and the roof at Madison Square 
Garden began to leak on the basketball 
court.
After the cancellations, I was left with 
only 18 sports events.
"Could I survive?” Then I remembered 
the videotape I had of the Superbowl.
“Wouldn’t mind seeing that again.”
* • *
Sometime around midnight, I gave 
the TV back to the family whose chil­
dren had put up such a courageous battle 
earlier in the day.
The black and white TV blew up some­
time around 11:30 pm. The Superbowl 
tape was over and the VCR began eating 
it. Good thing!
Now it was down to two TVs, and six 
basketball games. Just what I needed to 
send me over the top into basketball 
°irvana.
Then it happened.
Dick Vitale’s head exploded....

Intramural basketball champs crowned
45th annual IM Night features GSIA, Beta Youngbloods, Fitty Rocks
By ERIC STRAUSS
ByFRyA NKKMKRyAR tTSFRK ELMRSF
Carnegie Mellon University’s Intra­
mural Department put on its own ver­
sion of “March Madness” on Thursday 
night: the 45th Annual Intramural 
Night. The evening's games saw cham­
pions declared in all three levels of IM 
basketball: minor, intermediate, and 
major leagues.
For a group of graduating Master of 
Science in Industrial Administration 
(MSIA) candidates, the evening proved 
to be their last hurrah. The graduate 
students who comprised the Graduate 
School of Industrial Administration 
(GSIA) team jumped out to a 17-8 lead 
in the first quarter of the major league 
championship, and cruised to a 53-41 
victory over a team of Alpha Tau Omega 
(ATO) fraternity brothers and alumni.
In the intermediate league title game, 
youth triumphed over experience, as the 
Beta Youngbloods, the freshmen of Beta 
Theta Pi fraternity, defeated the Rott­
weilers, an independent team comprised 
primarily of graduate students, 43-35. 
In the minor league contest, Beta was 
not so fortunate, as the independent 
Fitty Rocks crushed the Beta Dan Issel 
+6 team, 41-24.
After the minor and intermediate 
league games, Earl J. Birdy, the director 
of Intramurals, led a trophy presenta­
tion, where all the champions of IM 
sports to date received their awards. 
Other presenters included Birdy’s assis­
tant, Mike Mastroianni, IM President 
Ted “Buddy” Feitt, Women’s IM Presi­
dent Tricia Williams, and IM Vice-Presi­
dent Dave Ekem.
Following the presentation, the major 
league game got rolling and so did GSIA. 
They jumped out to a 6-1 lead before 
ATO’s senior guard Matt Onaitis drilled 
a three-pointer to cut the lead down to 
6-4. Russ Morrison of GSIA struck back, 
nailing a pair of treys to make the lead 
12—4, and the lead grew to 15-4 before 
ATO rallied near the end of the first 
quarter to make the score 17-8.
ATO hung tough, and the GSIA lead 
at half-time had been cut to 23-17. After 
GSIA got off to a sloppy start to the 
second half, ATO closed to 23-20, but 
never came any closer. The score was 
35-24 at the end of the third quarter, 
and when the GSIA defense held ATO 
without a point through the first half of
defend our title next season.”
One team that will be around to de­
fend its title next season is the Beta 
Youngbloods, the fall 1992 and spring 
1993 pledge classes of Beta Theta Pi. 
Ironically, it was the one member of the 
team who is not affiliated with the fra­
ternity who starred in the game. Fresh­
man Erik Thompson poured in 22 points, 
including two three-pointers and sev­
eral outstanding plays to lead Beta past 
the Rottweilers.
The Rottweilers had the early lead, 
going up 13-9 at the end of the first 
quarter, led by junior John Muza’s three 
three-point field goals, before Thomp­
son hit a trey of his own at the buzzer to 
cut the lead to 13-12.
Half-time saw a 19-19 tie, as Thomp­
son continued his fine play, and doctoral 
candidate Don Katcher got hot for the 
Rottweilers to spark their team effort. 
Katcher would finish with 16 points, but 
it was not going to be enough.
In the second half, Lee Anton drilled a 
three-pointer to open the half for the 
Youngbloods, andBeta finished the third 
quarter with a 27-25 edge.
They put the game out of reach in the 
fourth quarter, finally finishing the 
graduate students, as Beta rebounding 
and Thompson’s shooting, combinedwith 
a long dry spell by the Rottweilers, gave 
Beta a 16-10 fourth quarter edge, and

14 points. Dag Hammer had 10 points 
and Travis Brown had nine for GSIA 
while sophomore Matt Neiss led ATO 
with 17 points, and Onaittis finished 
with eight.
An IM Department press release cred­
ited Miller “for his great ability as a 
point guard, his scoring ability, and his 
continuous hustle on defense.”
Miller, who captained the team to vic- 
toiy in a national tournament of master’s 
degree candidate earlier this year, said 
teamwork was whatgave GSIA the win.
“The reason we won was even though 
we were not the best individuals, we 
played the best as a team,” he said.
“This makes two tournaments in a 
row we’ve won, so we went out as win­
ners. We’re all graduating in the spring, 
so unfortunately, we won’t be around to
the hard-fought 43-35 victory.
Anton and Keith Dickerson finished 
with seven points each for Beta, while 
Muza, who did not score after the first 
quarter, finished with nine points for 
the Rottweilers.
“My last game, I played terrible,” Th­
ompson said after the contest. “I was 
really worried. I practiced hard yester­
day, and I just hoped to play well. And, 
what do you know? It worked, and we 
won.”
“But it wasn’t just me. If it wasn’t for 
teamwork, we never would have won.”
The minor league final saw the inde­
pendent Fitty Rocks rout the Beta Dan 
Issel +6 team, 41-24, behind junior John 
Cain and junior Jim Kasperik, who 
scored eight points each.

10The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 15 March 1993Steinbrenner back to meddle with Yankees
By DARREN CHIAPPETTA
ByFRyA tRyffHFMRCF
Well, Yankee fans, he’s back. As of midnight on 
March 1, George Steinbrenner’s “lifetime ban” from 
baseball ended. What this means to you and me is 
that General von Steingrabber, as he is affection­
ately known in the New York metropolitan area, is 
back to run the Yankees. What this means for the 
Yankees remains to be seen. If Steinbrenner holds 
true to previous form, it could mean that this 
promising young team will be disrupted, be it by 
trades (anyone remember Steve Trout?) and 
signings of worthless free agents (anyone remem­
ber Ed Whitson?), or just by the general meddlings 
of The Boss.
Hopefully, though, Steinbrenner, who has not 
returned to his post as Managing General Partner, 
leaving the job to his son-in-law, Jge Molloy, has 
mellowed during his two year vacation and will let 
manager Buck Showalter run the team the way he 
wants to.
Unfortunately, things will probably not work out 
that way. Spring is the season where hope springs 
eternal, and here’s one Yankee fan who hopes 
Steinbrenner lays off.
The 1993 Yankees have one of the most promis­
ing teams in the American League (AL) East. 
Toronto will be near the top, as they are every year, 
and Milwaukee and Baltimore both have some fine 
young talent that will allow the Brewers and Ori­
oles to once again contend for the AL East title.
However, it looks as if the Yankees may have 
finally used the free agent market and the trade 
route to their advantage, acquiring pitchers Jimmy 
Key from the Toronto Blue Jays and Jim Abbott 
from the California Angels, perennial All-Star 
third baseman Wade Boggs from the Boston Red 
Sox, and talented right fielder Paul O’Neill from 
the Cincinnati Reds.
Key struggled at times last season, but he is an 
experienced pitcher who could help some of the 
younger players cope with the pressures of a pos­
sible stretch run.
Abbott is a quality pitcher (he finished third in 
the 1991 Cy Young voting) who was the victim of a 
lack of run support when he pitched for the Califor­
nia Angels. He has the potential to be a dominant 
left-handed starter, a commodity every team de­
sires. Combined with hard-throwing right-hander 
Melido Perez, who must finally find consistency in 
his control, and a pair of youngsters, Sam Millitello, 
who threw seven innings of one-hit ball in his first 
major league start last season and impressed many 
during his two month stay in the big leagues, and 
Bob Wickman, another flame-thrower who went 
6-1 in a two-month major league debut, the Yan­
kees have what looks to be a fairly solid starting 
rotation.
The only dilemma for Showalter is who to name 
as his fourth and fifth starters should either of the 
kids falter. That is a mess he hopes will be cleared 
up during spring training. With veteran Scott 
Sanderson cut loose after two seasons as the Yan­
kee ace, there are several candidates,including 
erratic Scott Kamieniecki, veteran Neal Heaton, 
and inexperienced rookies Sterling Hitchcock and 
Ed Martol, but it is just too soon to be able to make 
any kind of determination about that yet.
Offensively, the Yankees have the potential to be 
one of the best clubs in the American League. If 
Boggs and first baseman Don Mattingly play back 
to their form of the mid-1980s, when they battled 
one another for the American League batting title, 
and outfielder/designated hitter Danny Tartabull 
fights off the injuries that plague him every yearRamsey Hong/Tartan Art Editor
and regains his power stroke, the Yanks could be a 
force this year. Boggs had an off-year last year (it 
was the first time in his career that he did not hit 
above a .300 average) and Mattingly and Tartabull 
had injuries that nagged them throughout the 
season. Roberto Kelly, the Yankees’ very talented, 
but very inconsistent All-Star center fielder, is 
gone, traded for O’Neill, but this could finally be 
the year when Bemie Williams, whom the Pin­
stripes have been grooming to play center for three 
years now, steps in and plays to his potential. 
Williams is a ‘Punch and Judy’ hitter who will beat 
out 20-30 infield hits, and steal between 30-50 
bases a year, and play a good, sometimes spectacu­
lar, center field. If he hamasses his speed, he is the 
leadoff hitter the Yanks have been searching for 
since Rickey Henderson went back to the A’s.
Pat Kelly, another promising youngster, will try 
to regain his spot as the starter at second base. He 
is the ideal number two hitter (is fast, has some 
power, and can handle the bat well enough to go the 
other way and move the runner along) if he can cut 
down on his strikeouts. He is also an excellent, if 
inexperienced, defensive player.
At shortstop, the Bronx Bombers have a bit of a 
logjam, with sparkplug Andy Stankewicz, high- 
priced veteran Mike Gallego, utilityman Randy 
Velarde, powerful rookie Dave Silvestri, and new­
comer Spike Owen.
“Stanky,” as Stankewicz is affectionately known, 
won the hearts of the Yankee faithful last season 
with his hard-nosed style of play. Gallego, signed to 
a big-bucks free agent contract, was acquired from 
the A’s before last year, and was to start at short 
until getting injured during spring training, giving 
Stankewicz his chance.
Last season, with Pat Kelly injured for parts of 
the season, a three-man rotation of Stankewicz, 
Gallego, and Kelly played both second and short. 
Owen is an off-season pickup who was acquired for 
his extensive major league experience and defen­
sive prowess, while Silvestri, whom the Yankees 
have tried to convert to a third baseman and 
catcher, is a valuable asset as a homerun hitting 
middle infielder. Velarde brings versitility to short, 
third base, and the outfield, and is coming off his 
best season ever with the bat.
In the outfield, O’Neill brings post-season expe­
rience (with the Reds) and can help the Yankees in 
this respect. In addition, his cannon arm might 
help Yankee fans forget the departed Jesse Barfield. 
Veteran Matt Nokes will likely again be the start­
ing catcher, despite some severe defensive prob­
lems. He is good for 20^25 home runs and 70-80 
RBIs if he can mature and improve his defense. 
Steady Mike Stanley could add 10 homeruns as the 
backup catcher. He could also start in the event 
Nokes self-destructs.
The designated hitter (DH) situation is also a bit 
cloudy. Tartabull’s injuries have often restricted 
his play in left field, forcing him to the DH spot. 
Left-handed hitting Kevin Maas, who came up 
with a bang in 1991 before becoming too enamored 
of Yankee Stadium’s short right field porch, could 
be the choice there, or the spot could go to utilityman 
Jim Leyritz, a hustling malcontent with some pop 
in his bat.
The team that Showalter has assembled for the 
1993 season has all the potential to be a contender. 
Showalter, who in his rookie season was revered 
for his methods of handling players, is highly 
respected by his players and peers. He is a good 
tactician, who, given a fair shake by Steinbrenner, 
could be the man to bring the Yankees to their first 
World Series title since 1978. Here’s hoping 
Steinbrenner gives him a chance to do it.

This past Friday, despite foul 
weather and electronic difficul­
ties, students, faculty, friends, 
andfamily floodedto Soldiers and 
Sailors Memorial Hall to witness 
another spectacular presentation 
of Greek Sing — an event not 
only filled with music and fun but 
one which also benefits the 
greater Pittsburgh community 
through charitable donations to 
worthwhile causes.
This year, all Greek Sing pro­
ceeds will benefit the Pittsburgh 
AIDS Task Force (PATF), an or­
ganization formed in 1985 in re­
sponse to the need for informa­
tion and support for AIDS vic­
tims their friends, and families. 
For AIDS victims, PATF offers a 
buddy program, advocacy, and 
al services. PATF also offers 
fee HIV testing as well as out- 
reacJi and prevention programs, 
a speakers bureau, a resources 
library, and a newsletter to people 
not afflicted with the disease. Red 
fib^.ons were also sold as a 
fundraiser at Greek Sing for at­
tendants to show their support 
fprthis cause. Roy Argali ofPATF 
sppke briefly during the evening 
t? encourage AIDS awareness 
and urged the audience to join
him in supporting AIDS patients by 
wearing a red ribbon not only for Greek 
Sing but every day.
Greek Council and Greek Sing Chair 
Tara Phillips, a senior policy andman- 
agement major, assembled a commit­
tee of assistants to help with security, 
publicity, finances, and organizing 
weekly house meetings. “It’s a more 
organized approach than usual,” says 
Phillips, “and it makes everything run 
a bit more smoothly.” This was also 
the first year Greek Sing has had a 
central theme, “We’ve Got Rhythm”— 
which was used mainly for publicity 
and programming. “The theme didn’t 
limit organizations for choices, 
though,” said Phillips.
“We’ve GotRhythm” produced a wide 
variety of musical acts. First up was 
Delta Tau Delta with their rendition 
of “The Muppets.” Songs were taken 
from both the movie and television 
show and included such favorites as 
the “The Rainbow Connection” and 
“Moving Right Along.” Next came the 
brothers and little sisters of Pi Lambda 
Phi who presented “PiLam Un­
plugged.” Acts included were an acous­
tical version of Eric Clapton’s “Layla,” 
a spoof on the new Willie Nelson Taco 
Bell commercial, and a plug for “Dig­
nity” Beer.
Next up was Pi Kappa Alpha with 
their act entitled “Back to the Basics.” 
It consisted of eight brothers and

song by Foreigner. I thought to 
myself, “That’s not classic rock.
That song was popular when I 
was in high school.” And then it 
struck me, Foreigner has joined 
the ranks with the Lovin’ Spoon­
ful and Herman’s Hermits. “Eeek, 
I’m getting old. I better start get­
ting my cholesterol, body fat, and 
colon checked,” I thought. That 
plus the fact that I’m starting to 
fear that if I go too near water, 
I’m going to start affecting the 
tides.
The problem is, I don’t know 
exactly how to go about exercis­
ing. My history of exercise has 
never been promising. I think it’s 
genetic. My brother, Dave, in his 
never-ending quest to meet 
women in high school, joined the 
Y.M.C.A. His plan was to work
out everyday and change into a 
big-major-stud-muffin. Not want­
ing to rush it, the first day he just 
went in and played some basket­
ball. Apparently, fearing that he 
might have strained himself on 
his first day of hoops, he went in, 
after a couple ofweeks, and played 
another game of basketball. A 
year membership and he played 
basketball a few times. Now that’s 
commitment. That’s pretty typi­
cal of me. I joined a weight club, 
a whole year membership, and 
lifted a grand total of... one day. 
That was 150 dollars well spent. 
So, joining a spa is out and that 
leaves only a few other ways of 
exercising.

Mellon Institute’s secrets are unveiled
’Schlag’s Nose
ko "Fypyqe "Mkko
To start things off, I need to make a correction. 
Last week I miBcredited the question about the 
Tilted Square. Mike Voytko actually sent the ques­
tion. Sorry, Mike. Got a little mixed up. For this 
week, I’m going to talk about Mellon Institute, 
home of many bio majors and one of the coolest 
libraries in academia.
I first went to the institute as a freshman, de- 
liveringsomethingformy work-study job. Walking 
up those steps, I felt like a lawyer going in to court. 
In fact, I’ve heard that Edgar Snyder filmed some 
sort of commercial there on the steps and that a few 
movies have used the courthouse look for back­
grounds. I have heard quite a bit about the radio­
active nature of the bricks used for interior walls, 
and Frank Burkus, a chem m^jor, claims that 
there is thorium in the glaze used in the bricks. 
Rick Scanlon, biology major, says that he has
personally held a Geiger counter to the walls and 
gotten a reading. “It was very low, though,” said 
Scanlon, “so I’m not scared or anything." Burkus 
and Scanlon agreed that Mellon shouldn’t be shut 
down, at least until after they graduate.
The building originally housed the independent 
Mellon Institute, a product of Andrew and Rich­
ard B. Mellon’s money. It was built over six years, 
beginninginl931.Ifyou get a chance, wander on 
down and take a look around. Just go down 
Morewood to Fifth and hang a left. Follow Fifth 
past Mellon Bank and the Software Engineering 
Institute (SEI). The Greek temple-looking thing 
on the left is Mellon. It really is modeled after 
Greek architecture — the columns are a dead 
giveaway. The proportions are those of the 
Parthenon, and some details are inspired by the 
Temple of Athena on the Acropolis and the Temple 
of Sardis in Asia Minor. The architects for this 
building were Janssen & Cacken.
The building has quite a few labs and much 
more. In its nine stories (three of which are under­
ground), there are offices, libraries, as well as 
Mellon Auditorium on the ground floor. The audi­
torium itself has enough material for a column. 
The decor is decidedly Greek Revival and the 
place is just about the right size for recitals or 
readings.
The best part of Mellon, I think, is the outside.

I’ve seen many variations on run­
ning but no actual running. One 
of the variations I have seen, 
makes me believe that Hitler 
didn’t actually die and has be­
come a fitness instructor (body 
by Mein Führer, look good or die). 
I’m not kidding. There are run­
ners who start out running and 
then start doing this weird goose- 
step thing. They are either former 
SS officers or they are thinking of 
auditioning for the Rockettes.
Now I hope I don’t offend any­
one and if I do, that means you 
are probably one of the people 
that myself and many others are 
secretly laughingat. I am talking 
about, of course, RpC ,SAKRMTyRMSA
HyiOe Is there a reason for this? 
The only reason I can think of is 
that these people’s schedules are 
so busy that they have to choose 
between exercising and going to 
the bathroom. Apparently, exer­
cising wins out. They may be 
uncomfortable and people may 
be laughing at them but at least 
they’re in shape.
The only other option left to me 
is aerobics. They have classes 
right here at CMU. I’m not sure 
that I could do this. For one, I am 
so out of shape that the class 
would quickly change from an 
aerobics class to a bunch of people 
gathering every week to laugh at 
me. Another very good reason is 
there would be a whole class of in­
shape women in skimpy outfits. 
That would mean I would speijd 
the whole time blushing. With 
the concentration of women be­
ing so great, the blush would be 
so intense that all the blood in my 
body would end up in my face and 
I would die — or worse yet, faint. 
That leaves me doing aerobicsat 
home.
The guiding guru of home 
aerobics is Ms. “I’m-a-liberal- 
with-convictions-but-I-married- 
a-capitalist-swine-magnate- any­
way” Jane Fonda. As far as ypu 
know, I spoke with her about what 
it takes to stay in shape. “Well, it

Please see EXERCISE, page L3Dr. Ruth uses humor to teach
By CHRISTIAN RESTIFO
ByFRyA -SFGq ELMRSF
Last Monday night, Dr. Ruth 
Westheimer spoke in the Skibo 
Ballroom. Her talk, “Sexually 
Speaking,” was the climax to 
Sex Week. Afterwards, she par­
ticipated in an interview and 
spoke to a small group of stu­
dents.
Talking to Dr. Ruth is like 
talking to the stereotypical 
grandmother. She directs you to 
sit down next to her by tugging 
on your sleeve or patting the 
seat, and she puts her hand on 
your shoulder or your knee ev­
ery minute or so, as if to make 
sure you’re still paying atten­
tion.
Perhaps one of the most nag- 
gingquestions on people’s minds 
is just pSH she got started in 
such an interesting career. Be­
fore starting her road to fame, 
Dr. Ruth worked in the public 
sector. Unfortunately, her grant 
ran out and she had to seek 
employment. She then started
working for Planned Parenthood. 
It was 12 years ago that she 
started her radio show.
I asked Dr. Ruth why she felt 
she was so popular. She attrib­
uted her success to many factors 
such as the facts that she’s an 
older woman, very well trained, 
and capable of using humor.
“I also don’t wear a mini-skirt,” 
she said. “My accent and being 
short has not detracted.”
She also feels that her non- 
confrontational manner helps her 
get her message across.
“Part of my being successful is 
that I’m not a missionary,” she 
said.
Dr. Ruth maintains a strong 
standard when it comes to her 
shows and other media events 
that concern sex. For example, 
she will not debate and will “not 
do anything to shock.”
In short, she feels that debat­
ing accomplishes little.
“There is a fine line coneming 
sensationalism,” she said. Con­
cerning sex on TV, Dr. Ruth be­
lieves that there i s nothing wrong
with it. “I don’t mind the sex on 
TV,” she said. “What I do mindis 
the violence.” While parents 
should have some control, she 
has no problem with children see­
ing sex on TV.
I thought that after writing 
several books, hosting call-in TV 
and radio shows, and making 
countless appearances, Dr. Ruth 
would have one thing to point to 
as her greatest accomplishment 
of which she is most proud. Well, 
she did, but it wasn’t quite what 
I expected. “My grandson,” she 
said. “Before that, my daughter” 
Just like the proud grandmother, 
Dr. Ruth does not hesitate to talk 
about her daughter who has a 
PhD or her son who is working on 
his.
At the end, I asked Dr. Ruth 
how she most wanted to be re­
membered. “If I have prevented 
one unwanted pregnancy,” she 
said, “one case of AIDS, then I 
have done my job.” I’m not sure if 
she would be more proud of this 
or her first response: “As the b6st 
grandmother!”

UDC helps students fight back
By HEIDI HOOVER
ByFRyA cSARFMkGRMAh ELMRSF
Cases heard by the University Committee on 
Discipline (UDC) are shrouded in secrecy — ad­
ministrators will not even acknowledge that a case 
exists to someone not directly involved. This pro­
tects the confidentiality of those involved, but also 
tends to make the UDC seem mysterious and 
forbidding. Many are unaware of the procedures of 
the UDC, though they are public knowledge. Be­
cause the UDC is an important resource for stu­
dents in disciplinary situations, everyone should 
know how it works.
Pat Harned, an assistant to the dean of Student 
Affairs, is in charge of the UDC. She says the first 
• step is the report of the incident, which she receives 
from a student or from Campus Police. Cases do 
not automatically go to the UDC if they are re­
ported to Student Affairs, especially cases of sexual 
assault or sexual harassment. Any action taken is 
according to the wishes of the student making the 
. complaint. Harned then meets with the complain­
ant to find out the details of what happened. A 
UDC hearing is scheduled when there is a “gross 
violation of University policy, a disagreement be­
tween the complainant [person bringing the charges 
— either the University or a student] and the 
Respondent [the person against whom charges are 
being brought] on the facts of what happened, or 
when a student brings charges against another 
student,” says Harned. Harned then meets sepa­
rately with the complainant (if the complainant is 
a student) and the respondent and explains the 
.procedures of the UDC to them. She tells them 
about any witnesses she plans to bring, as well as 
who else will be there. This meeting usually hap­
pens about seven days before the hearing. Anyone 
who is being charged also receives any information 
, about the case that the board receives.
The hearing group is made up of four people — 
two students and two faculty members or adminis­
trators. Anne Witchner, the assistant dean of Stu­
dent Affairs and director of Student Activities, is 
the moderator for the hearings, and Harned is 
there as well.
The students are chosen from a pool of about 40 
people which includes members of Student Gov­
ernment and other student leaders. People are 
chosen randomly from this pool for each hearing 
and are not put in that hearing group if they know 
any of the students involved or already know about 
the case. Harned says Student Affairs does try to 
put a member of the Greek system in groups for 
Greek-related cases.
Complainants and respondents, says Harned, 
: may bring character references and witnesses to 
: the incident, and each may have a person as coun­
sel during the hearing. If one of the parties chooses 
to bring legal counsel, he or she must notify Harned, 
so the hearing group and the other party have the
opportunity to have a lawyer there.
UDC hearings are taped, so the tapes can be 
used to review the hearing in case of an appeal. At 
the beginning of the hearing, all of those present 
introduce themselves for the tape. Then the mod­
erator goes over the procedure to make sure every­
one understands it.
Next are the opening statements, when the 
complainant and the respondent tell their stories 
uninterrupted. The complainant also says why he 
or she chose to bring the charges.
The hearing group questions the complainant, 
then the respondent. After that come the conversa­
tional questions, when the hearing group asks any 
questions it still wants answered. The complain­
ant and respondent can ask questions of each other 
through the hearing group by asking the group to 
ask the questions.
Next, the hearing group questions any charac­
ter references or witnesses the complainant and 
respondent bring. The moderator will then ask 
repeatedly whether there are any more questions.
When all the questions have been answered, the 
complainant and the respondent give closing state­
ments. The complainant asks the board for what­
ever sanctions he or she thinks are necessary. The 
respondent also recommends sanctions for him- or 
herself.
The hearing group then deliberates and recom­
mends a course of action to Michael Murphy, the 
dean of Student Affairs. Murphy can accept the 
hearing group’s decision about the sanctions or 
review the hearing and change them. Each party 
will be notified in writing of the final decision.
If the complainant or respondent believes there 
was a significant mistake in the due process of the 
hearing, the sanctions were too mild or too harsh, 
the decision made was not supported by evidence, 
or new evidence has become available, making a 
new hearing necessary, he or she may appeal the 
decision of the UDC, according to the tRGLCAR 
PyALkSSOe
The appeal must be made within seven calendar 
days of receipt of the official decision. If the person 
is not satisfied with the outcome of the appeal, he 
or she may make a final appeal to the University 
President.
In order to prepare for a UDC hearing, Harned 
recommends that students bring counsel if they 
want it and write their opening and closing state­
ments ahead of time. If they have written material 
they want the hearing group to see ahead of time, 
they may submit it to be included in the group’s 
packets. They may also bring written material for 
the hearing group the day of the hearing, but they 
must bring enough copies for everyone in the group.
More details of the disciplinary system are out­
lined in Section VII of the 1992-93 tRGLCAR PyAL1

answers to specific questions by contacting the

As a matter of fact, I would 
suggest that as a way to be 
successful in any venture... ride 
your parents coattails,” she 
said. Well so that’s where I went 
wrong. I don’t need to exercise, 
I need new parents. That’s a
relief, now I can watch more T.V. 
and put off looking for new par­
ents until tomorrow. I think 
America as a whole could benefit 
from this advice — go out and get

Amtrak gives job to CMU senior design students
By TONYA RADO
ByFRyA cSTo tRyff
In response to the recently 
passed Americans with Dis­
abilities Act (ADA), a program 
designed to provide “disabled" 
persons the same access to pub­
lic facilities as “abled” persons, 
20 senior industrial design stu­
dents in interdisciplinary coop­
eration with graphic design and 
architecture students are re­
designing restrooms for all 
Amtrak railcars as a required 
semester-long degree project. 
Students will present their pro­
posed solutions to Amtrak in 
April.
The students have been di­
vided into six teams. Each will 
design and build full-scale mod­
els of restrooms which are easy 
to understand, accessible, and 
conform to the needs of every­
one, especially the specific 
needs of people with disabili­
ties.
There are currently 43 mil­
lion disabled Americans. “More 
and more, our definition of dis­
abled is growing to include not 
only blind people, those in 
wheelchairs, or with hearing 
impairments, but also the eld­
erly, mothers with children, and 
those who are temporarily dis­
abled with broken bones,” says
Michael Stratmann, associate 
professor of design and principal 
project investigator. “Our designs 
for Amtrak must accommodate 
as many people as possible.”
The project began in January, 
1993 when students first spoke 
with Cesar Vergara of Amtrak 
and inspected one of the railcars. 
They then began their analysis 
and ideation.
On March 3, they presented 
their ideas and concept decisions 
to Amtrak with drawings, scale 
models, and video tapes. Cur­
rently, the teams are construct­
ing their real size models, writ­
ing reports and preparing slides 
of their work for final presenta­
tions on April 28.
This is only the first project in 
the collaboration between the 
Design Department and Amtrak. 
The next assignment in the fall 
will be the design of an accessible 
dining and vending area.
Graphic design students pri­
marily work on the communica-
as well as other departments 
help to achieve their primary 
goal.
“Part of what makes this 
project unique,” says Stratr 
mann, “is that our students are 
being confronted with-the cons', 
cept of universal design, [ex* 
panding our conception of abili­
ties to incorporate features that 
make things easier to use]. Grab 
handles in a restroom, for ex­
ample, not only facilitate trans­
fer from wheelchair to toilet'; 
but also allow people to stabi'-' 
lize themselves in a moving 
train.”
Universal design is aimed to 
benefit human needs. “It is nol 
comparative with industrial 
design working for Whirlpool 
or IBM,” he said. “It focuses on 
the intelligent design of a very 
limited space, in addition to the 
actual design of products like 
sinks or paper towel dispens­
ers.”
Disability,explains Strat
tion and wayfinding aspects ofv mann, is not abnormality —j
the project. Professor Bruce 
Lindsey and Paul Rosenblatt 
(CMU Architectural Design Prac­
tice Center) and fifth year archi­
tecture students provide their 
perspective. A board of advisors 
from the Three Rivers Center for 
Independent Living and advisors 
from the Department of Design
ignorance is. The ADA is neces­
sary and effective. “Now,” he; 
says, “we have to bring the laws; 
and regulations much closer to 
people through design.” It has 
to be the partnership in an in­
clusive thought process between, 
the disabled, the designers ancl 
the manufacturers.
Questions about Mellon Institute are answered
’SCHLAG, from page 12
It’s hard to go by it without looking in wonder at the 
sheer mass of the place — it looks bomb proof. 
Modern buildings look like a good sneeze (or a 
bomb in the basement) could render them helpless.
Part of that feeling is the result of the use of the 
Parthenon proportions and the size of the columns 
that run all the way around. They are built of KMAhiC 
pieces of limestone 36 feet high and almost 5 feet 
wide, a ratio of seven-and-a-half to one, and weigh 
60 tons. Sixty tons times 62 columns is 3,720 tons, 
and that’s without capitals or bases.
The columns had to be rough cut and finished. 
Here’s, the crazy part — they built a lathe to finish 
them on! Imagine a machine that can hold a rect­
angular piece of limestone that weighs about 125
tons, spin it and carve off big chunks. That boggjes 
my imagination.
Even more amazing, none of the columns varies 
by more than 1/16th of an inch from any of the 
others. It took workmen about two hours to nut 
each one up, including the bases and tops. (
Once again I thank Professor Ted Fenton for tyie 
use of his manuscript for information and inspira­
tion. If you think any of the things I mention t^re 
worth looking into, give him a call. I know he bps 
more info about it. Make sure you pick up his bofjk 
when it comes out. ,

Lion Sleeps Tonight,” and “The 
Chain Gang.” Then came Delta 
Gamma with their version of 
“Gypsy” which was filled with 
complicated choreography and 
extravagant costumes.
The brothers and sisters of Al­
pha Epsilon Pi took the stage 
next for their rendering of “Jo­
seph and the Amazing Tech­
nicolor Dreamcoat.” Songs in­
cluded “Jacob and Sons,” “One 
More Angel in Heaven,” and the 
“Pharaoh’s Song.” Beta Theta Pi 
followed with a more serious pre­
sentation than past years with 
“The Pajama Game.” Kappa 
Kappa Gamma closed the first 
act with songs and dance from 
“Anything Goes.” Their presen­
tation included songs such as 
“Blow Gabriel” and “Anything 
Goes,” not to mention some tap 
dancing and great costumes.
Sigma Nu opened the second 
act with a short presentation of 
“King Tut” which followed in the 
steps of Steve Martin from tyR1
GFLyo IMhpR sMnCe Next, in a com­
bined effort, Kappa Alpha Theta 
and Phi Kappa Theta joined up to 
present “Beauty and the Beast.” 
The sets and costumes were first 
rate as was the energy and pre­
sentation of the Disney classic. 
“Prime Time Kappa Sigma” fol­
lowed with a funny spoof of cur­
rent television trends which in­
cluded bits from cpCCFKl BpC sSnC 
mSyRl BpC .GOCK SfPy<yFfil and a 
Madonna video.
Next the sisters of Delta Delta 
Delta presented a series of songs 
and dances from the musical 
cyRKl in full costume and make­
up.
Then Delta Upsilon returned 
to the competition after a one 
year hiatus with their rendition
“Barnum,” the 1980 musical 
about circus showman and pro­
moter P. T. Barnum. Sigma Tau 
Gamma took tp the stage next 
with “Damn Yankees,” a musical 
depicting the lives of baseball 
players. Next came “Newsies,” 
Kappa Delta Rho’s rendering of 
the Disney movie spotlighting the 
lives of New York newspaper boys 
at the turn of the century. Then 
came last year’s second place yvin- 
ners, the brothers and pledges of 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, who main­
tained a classy presence in!full 
tuxedos and top hats while mas­
tering their complicated choreog­
raphy to the tune of “Me and My 
Girl.” Songs included “The 
Lambeth Walk” and “Leaning on 
a Lamp Post,” with a solo by se­
nior social and decision sciences 
major Matt Miller. The evening 
came to a close with the reigning 
Greek Sing champions, Theta Xi 
who presented the “Best Little 
Whorehouse in Texas,” which fea­
tured brothers and pledges danc­
ing and singing in drag.
Unfortunately, for all the time 
and effort put into the program, 
the audio and electronic accom­
paniment provided by AB Tech 
were not up to par. Many groups, 
after performing, complained 
they could not hear the music 
and likewise, members of the 
audience found themselves 
straining to hear the acts up on 
stage.
AB Tech was also experiencing 
difficulties with the microphones. 
“We had a couple of technical 
problems last night with the 
michs,” says Peter Weiland, 
sophomore ECE major, of AB 
Tech. “We had two hand-held and 
two cordless body microphones, 
and they just started dying out 
one by one. We’re not sure why.” 
However, a few technical diffi­
culties did not prevent the par­
ticipants or the audience from 
witnessing yet another excellent 
performance of Greek Sing.

day night. The results were as

Faculty artwork showcased in Shadyside

burgh Center for the Arts hosted an sometimes it’s nice to just appreciate the 
opening reception for the Carnegie work, and not worry about the name but 
Mellon faculty art exhibit. This included in an exhibit like this, it just didn’t work, 
a variety of works from video and holo- People came here to see the faculty’s 
grams to painting and fish 
sculptures.
Students, exhibiting art­
ists, and friends braved the 
oncoming blizzard and 
made their way to the 
rather elaborate building 
on the corner of Shady and 
Fifth. If everyone else was 
like me, they were some­
what confused when they 
first walked in. After hang­
ing up your coat and inch­
ing your way through the 
groups of people, it was 
hard to tell which way to 
go to see the professors’ 
work. Since the Center car­
ries more than one exhibit 
at a time, you had to just 
sort of stand there for a 
few minutes, gape around, 
and hope that you were 
walkinginto the right area.
I needed a professor to 
point out to me that there 
were programs you needed 
to identify the work. The

without lots of searching and matching, minu m

part that didn’t make that aspect work, t i o n s ,

One of Bennett’s pieces titled “Land Site

textures made 
it difficult to not 
reach out and 
touch it. Next to 
that were two 
works by 
Rogers that 
looked like a network of tubes, colored 
light bulbs, and intersections that stood 
out from the wall and practically glowed 
in the gallery’s spotlights.
In the hallway con­
necting the two areas 
displaying work on the 
second floor was a hu- 
man-height-sized hand 
entitled “Monument To 
465 Americans: A Typi­
cal Week of Deaths By 
Gunfire In The United 
States.” This effective 
work by Joseph Man- 
nino looks like a nor­
mal, open palm from 
one direction, but on 
the back of the hand 
are names of465 people 
— all killed by gunfire. 
It makes you wonder 
about the power of one 
hand and what it can 
do to so many people, 
just by equipping it 
with a gun.
This hallway led to a 
small room where a few 
pieces were on display, 
one being former CFA Dean Lowry Bur­
gess’ sculpture titled “Infinite Hologram/ 
Infinite Form.” What looks like a small 
sculptured rock sits on top of a hologram 
that faintly resembles the features of a 
face. But the hologram is so vague that 
it ends up looking somewhat like a 
Rorshach inkblot test.

A lot of people seem to be dissatisfied with the ’A,yAAo Ü—6CAe
A new cartoon, unprecedented line of action figures, and the fact 
that Marvel Comics is now selling stock all point to some level of 
commercialization. But issue #300 of ’A,yAAo Ü—6CA was re­
leased this week, and I have to say that for me, the dream of 
Charles Xavier still lives on. The only team of comic book superhe­
roes who have ever fought prejudice is still alive, even in the wake 
of company executives who seem to have sold out.
The X-Men have always been one step ahead of their time. Long 
before advertisements and organizations had to be “politically 
correct,” a black woman, the mutant called Storm, was the leader 
of the X-Men, who also had a wheelchair-bound teacher, Professor 
X. Long before the cold war between the superpowers ended, a 
Russian man, Colossus, was accepted as a member of the nomi­
nally American team. And long before superheroes were portrayed 
with brains as well as brawn, Dr. Henry McCoy, a 
mutant genius known as The Beast, was a charter 
member of the X-Men.

The X-Men stories have also always been a bit 
prophetic when you compare it to other fiction.
Whoever dreamt up the Holodeck in the new Star 
Trek series must have previously seen the X-Men’s 
holographic training facility, called the Danger Room.
And Max Headroom’s “20 minutes into the future” 
world, dominated by television screens, is almost 
certainly reminiscent of the Mojoverse, where gov­
ernment officials are “programmers” and 
“schedulers.”
But what sets the X-Men apart for me is that their 
main enemy has always been one that I have also 
fought with my meager experience and skills. I can’t 
relate to megalomaniacal terrorists or uncontrolled 
robots or evil, green aliens. What I can relate to is 
normal people who close their minds when faced 
with something different. I have experienced preju­
dice and hatred, the very enemies that the X-Men 
have fought for 30 years.

The X-Men are mutants, human beings with ab­
normal genetic traits, or as is sometimes speculated, 
the next step in the evolution of human beings, 
homo-superior. Mutants have great strength, un­
usual abilities, and sometimes high ambitions at 
the expense of other people, just like “normal” hu­
man beings.
Some people in the Marvel Comics universe, mu­
tant and human aUke, believe that the two cannot 
co-exist. And some, like the X-Men, believe that 
everyone can exist in the same world.
I write this knowing full well that it’s impossible 
to compress 30 years of characterization, plotting, 
and excellent art into five or six paragraphs. And I 
can’t make people who have never heard of the X- 
Men like them instantly, nor can I make zealous 
fans of other comics appreciate the X-Men immedi­
ately. I would venture a guess that most comic book 
readers are looking for some form of escapism, 
something violent, something metaphysical, some­
thing magical.

Issue #300 is by no means the greatest story over told about the 
’A,yAAo Ü—6CAe But it does bring together, after months of 
foreshadowing, the fight between two opposing ideals. The X-Men, 
who believe that mutants and humans can co-exist on the same 
world together, go to France and battle the Acolytes, a group of 
fanatical mutants who believe the opposite, and therefore wish to 
exterminate all humans without any genetic mutant ability
(Flatscans, to invoke the slang).
And, contrary to all the hype and false advertising by comic 
guides and stores, Magneto, the old adversary and former mentor 
of the X-Men, does not return, or even make an appearance. 
Magneto supposedly died in X-Men volume two, issue #3, but 
comic book deaths tend not to be permanent. But we only see 
subtle hints suggesting that Magneto didn’t die.
John Romita Jr., returns for this issue to render his excellent 
art, and the story is written by Scott Lobdell.

The Trial
Directed by Orson Welles, The Trial is an adap­
tation of a Kafka novel (of the same name) about 
a man in a nameless country who is arrested for a 
crime that is never explained to him. In true 
Kafkaesque existentialist style, Welles never both­
ers letting us know where he is or what he was 
arrested for either.
Welles’ classic staging and direction make for 
quite an interesting overall effect.
If you really like desperate existentialist-type 
stuff, this film is probably just for you. If not, it’s 
probably worth going just to see Welles’ directing 
talent at work.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Due to spring break, there will be no movies 
shown on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday (March 19

cldth-printed photograph, contains an old camera 
that stands out from the wall and connects the piece’s 
theme of photography. Unfortunately, there were 
space restraints because of all the people walking up 
and down the stairs, so it wasn’t easy to view the piece 
for any longer than about 20 seconds.
There were only a few pieces downstairs; two of 
tiiem videos by John Sturgeon, titled “Narjcose: Video 
Documentation of Two Channel, Video Sculptural 
Installation,” and Luis Valdovino, titled “Tierra 
Niieva.” Again, given the limited space, it was hard 
for more than three people to watch itatonce,andthe 
murmur of the milling crowd was somewhat distract­
ing; however, from what I was able to see, both pieces 
were interesting and kind of quirky. Two paintings by 
Susanne Slavick, a lithograph by Patricia Bellan- 
GSlen, and an engraving by Joann Maier made up the 
rest of the first floor.
As an art student, I thought this exhibit was a good 
idea. It’s rare that art students get to see their 
instructor’s work, especially in the classroom. So 
there’s always that air of wonder as to what your 
instructor really does. Can they draw well? Can they 
sculpt well? Do you have any clue what their work’s 
about? Are they like that guy on PBS with the brillo 
pad head? You know, just those silly recurrent ques­
tions that pop up during a critique when they’re 
totally ripping you apart. You wonder if they’re actu­
ally worthy. So seeing their work on display shows 
you that, not only are they practicing artists, but 
they’re'also people who are working hard, just like the 
rest of us, to achieve something that they’ve always 
wanted to do.
. The exhibit will be open now through May 3 and is 
free and open to the public. The Pittsburgh Center of 
the Arts is located at 6300 Fifth Ave. in Shadyside.

Swoon
If you missed this film’s Pittsburgh premiere 
at the Filmmaker’s last month, you’ll want to 
make sure you catch it on campus this Thursday.
Directed by Tom Kalin, Swoon tells the story 
of Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb, two 
Jewish intellectuals who were made famous by 
lddnapping and murdering a 13-year-old boy in 
1924. Instead of focusing on the trial or the actual 
act, like previous films about the same subject, 
this film focuses instead on the way that the 
public saw these acts as being directly related to 
their homosexuality.
The film shows how the public saw their crimi­
nal acts as reinforcement for seeing the dangers 
of Judaism, intellectualism, and homosexuality, 
and how the lives of the two criminals were 
affected by their society and these prejudices.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Friday, April 2
Unforgiven
Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, 
Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor for this 
year’s Oscar awards, Unforgiven stars Clint 
Eastwood and Gene Hackman in a new Western 
film.
Eastwood (in an Oscar-nominated perfor­
mance) plays a cowboy who tries to lay down his 
gun but is tempted by a band of ruffians to 
become a hired assasin. It strips the veneer off 
the classic Western you’re all used to.
If you want to see Eastwood in a critically 
acclaimed performance, go spend the buck.
At 5:45, 8,10:15 pm and 12:30 am.
Saturday, April 3
Aladdin
Has the Pittsburgh weather gotten you down, 
are you depressed to be back from spring break, 
or are you just looking for a good laugh? Well, 
Aladdin is the movie for you.
The story is engaging; the animation is sharp 
and colorful; and Robin Williams who provides 
the voice of the Genie is maniacally hysterical. 
The music is catchy and fits in where it’s used. A 
grand show-stopper reminiscent of Beauty and 
the Beast’s “Be Our Guest,” “Friend Like Me,” 
allows Williams to do a few imitations (Arnold 
Schwartzenegger, Jack Nicholson, William F. 
Buckley, and Robert DeNiro — just to name a 
few), and amazingly, the animators are able to 
keep up with the wild shape-changing Genie.
So go see Aladdin at DH 2210. Where else are 
you going to see a magic carpet with its own 
personality?
At 5:15, 7, 8:45,10:30 pm and 12:15 am.
Sunday, April 4
Dynamo
Bruce Lee stars in this modern-setting kung 
fu film. Dynamo features plenty of what you 
watch kung fu for, bad dubbing, brilliant martial 
arts sequences, amazing sound effects, and, of 
course, the ever crucial revenge-based plot struc­
ture.
As this film is set in the late 1970s, you, the 
viewer, will have the added pleasure of watching 
Bruce “Enter the Dragon” Lee model all the most 
fashionable martial arts wear from that period, 
including some really cool retro-Adidasesque, 
sweat/jumpsuits, in fabulous primary colors.
The soundtrack is also amazing. So, if you’re 
looking for kung fu to satisfy as many of your 
senses as possible without actually getting hit, 
Dynamo is the film for you.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
