Vol. VI. No. 9 Carnegie Technical Schools, Pittsburgh, Pa. November 23, 1911
FOOTBALLERS WORK OVERTIME 
AT CLEVELAND.
Again hopelessly outweighed by 
their opponents, the Carnegie Tech 
eleven was worsted in the contest 
with Western Reserve, the final score 
being 15 to 0. Before a rooting section 
of a hundred faithful followers, head­
ed by the now famous Carnegie band, 
the members of the Varsity played 
their hearts out in the attempt to win 
their first Cleveland game.
In the first period our boys played 
rings around the home team. Then 
beef began to tell, and the ball was 
seldom out of our territory. Yet, as 
has been recorded in the histories of 
other games, the light Plaid line held 
best when the - goal was threatened.
A strong wind blew diagonally 
down and across the field, and made 
kicking of all kinds unreliable. The 
spasmodic gust also interfered with 
the handling of punts and forward 
passes, making it necessary to use 
straight football tactics. Dame For­
tune favored the Clevelanders on the 
open plays whenever the element of 
chance was able to enter. All of these 
contributed to our defeat, coupled 
with the style of play—one in which 
our light team could not shine.
Because of some misunderstanding, 
no timekeepers were provided for the 
first period, and the game ran almost 
30 minutes before the whistle blew. 
Time was taken out repeatedly by 
both teams, and, as a consequence, 
the game was continued until the ball 
could scarcely be seen. The game 
was ended with one minute to play.
Captain “Blinkey” Taylor, as usual, 
played the star game on the line, be­
ing closely seconded by Crawford, 
Ayres played well in the latter part 
of the game. The ends, Kesselman 
and McCully, were effective in smash­
ing up Reserve interference, but both 
were badly used up. Balsinger and 
Schmucker featured in. the backfield. 
while Atch and Lucas Were never fai 
behind. The two last named were 
handicapped by their lack of avoir­
dupois, or both would have made 
names for themselves, judging by 
their spirit.
The’ Tartan leader chose the goal 
that gave him the wind to his back. 
Hoagland kicked off to Atch on hisi 
15-yard mark, and the speedy half­
back returned 15 more before being 
downed. Schmucker booted 35 units, 
and the Plaid line held. Hoagland 
punted to McCully, the ball stopping 
on our 45 mark. Schmucker’s punt 
went only to Reserve’s 52 mark, and 
Waterworth stopped in the middle of 
the field, Hoagland’s kick was caught 
by the wind and blown out of bounds
on Carnegie’s 54 mark. Atch made a 
gain of 4 yards around end, and Lu­
cas, with the aid of superb interfer­
ence carried the ball 25 yards. Bal­
singer gained 3 feet, but Atch was 
thrown for a 5-yard loss. Schmucker 
punted to Hoagland on his 10 mark, 
and McCully got the big guard in 
his tracks. Hoagland’s punt was 
again caught by the wind and stopped 
30 yards from his goal. Balsinger 
failed to gain and Carnegie drew a 
five-yard penalty for off-side. 
Schmucker kicked to the 15 mark. Re­
serve failed to make first down on 
line bucks, and Hoagland kicked to 
Lucas on our 43 line. Schmucker 
punted out of bounds and Atch was 
closest to the ball when the referee 
pried the mass apart. Balsinger 
gained 4 units, but Spurney inter­
cepted a forward pass. He then 
gained 3 yards through the line, and** 
Snider made but one. Spurm-.y tried 
again and won 4 units, after which 
Hoagland kicked to his 47 line. A 
poor pass lost Carnegie the ball on 
our 52 yard line. Spurney and Snider 
then hammered our line for two first 
downs, Welch stopping Spurney 10 
yards from our goal. Snider cut the 
distance to one yard, and then car­
ried the ball over, but Reserve was 
off-side, and was penalized 5 yards. 
The whole Carnegie . team jammed 
together and Snider could not break 
through. The agony was over, for 
the ball went to Taylor’s men on his
5-yard line. Schmucker’s punt stop­
ped 25 yards from our goal, and Sni­
der gained 3 of them. The Reserve 
team was penalized 15 yards for hold­
ing. Spurney and Snider carried the 
ball to the 20 mark, and Hoagland 
attempted a field goal, but this failed. 
Schmucker punted 35 yards from the
25 line, then the referee decided to 
take a rest, and ended the quarter.
With timekeepers working, Spurney 
started the second period with a gain 
of 3 yards to his 53-yard line. Stroup 
started a no-good forward pass, and 
Hoagland kicked to Lucas on the 
Pittsburgh 17 line. Schmucker’s puni 
traveled 13 yards against the breeze. 
Snider made first down on two tries,! 
then Spurney got 10 yards around; 
end. This brought the ball 10 yards' 
from our goal, and again the line held. 
Hoagland tried to drop-kick over the 
cross-piece, but couldn’t, as Taylor 
was in the way. One of our men got 
the ball on our 20-yard line, and 
Schmucker and Hoagland exchanged 
punts. Schmucker kicked again and

CROSS COUNTRY RACE SATUR­
DAY.
The Annual Cross Country Race 
for the Championship of the Schools 
will be held this coming Saturday 
morning, November 25. This race has 
been eagerly awaited by the long dis­
tance runners of the Schools of Ap­
plied Design, Applied Science and Ap­
plied Industries, and it is expected 
that quite a number of men will toe 
the mark when the race starts. Last 
year some thirty athletes, clad in run­
ning clothes, ran over the three-mile 
course on ground which was covered 
with six inches of snow and ice. Every 
man displayed that indomitable Car­
negie Spirit and finished the face, ex- 
Captain Wait leading the crowd, with 
the other men bunched behind caus­
ing a number of exciting finishes.
The race will start promptly at ten 
o’clock from the Field House, and 
the men will finish at that point just 
as soon as they cover the three-mile 
course thru Schenley Park. Weather 
conditions permitting, a large num­
ber of students will be on hand to 
cheer the favorites from their respec­
tive schools as they cross the tape.-----------o-----------

OUR CALL TO RECESS.
“The people of this land having by 
long sanction and practice set apart 
toward the close of each passing year 
a day on which to cease from their 
labors and assemble for the purpose 
of giving praise to Him who is the 
author of those blessings they have 
enjoyed, it is my duty as Chief Exec­
utive to designate at this time the 
day for the fulfillment of this devout 
purpose.
“Our country has been favored sig­
nally in many ways. The round of 
the seasons has brought rich harvests. 
Our industries have thriven far be­
yond our domestic needs, the produc­
tion of our labor is finding daily en­
larged markets abroad. We have 
been free from the curses of pesti­
lence, of famine and of war. Our 
national counsels have furthered the 
cause of peace in other lands and the 
spirit of benevolence has brought us 
into closer touch with other peoples, 
to the strengthening of the bonds of 
fellowship and good will that link us 
to our comrades in the universal 
brotherhood of nations.
“Strong in the sense of our own 
right and inspired by as strong a sense 
of the rights of others, we live in 
peace and harmony with the world. 
Rich in the priceless possession and 
abundant resources wherewith the un­
stinted bounty of God had endowed 
us we are unselfishly glad when other 
peoples pass onward to prosperity 
and peace.
“That the great privileges we enjoy 
may continue and that each coming 
year may see our country more firmly 
established in the regard and esteem 
of our fellow-nations is the prayer 
that should arise in every thankful 
heart.
“Wherefore, I, William Howard 
Taft, President of the United States 
of America, designate Thursday, the 
thirtieth of November, next, as a day 
of thanksgiving and prayer, and I 
earnestly call upon my countrymen 
and upon all that dwell under the flag 
of our beloved country, then to meet 
in their accustomed places of worship 
to join in offering praise to Almighty 
God and devout thanks for the lov­
ing mercies He has given to us.
“In witness thereof I have hereunto 
set my hand, caused the seal of the 
United States to be affixed.
“Done at the city of Chicago, this 
thirtieth day of October, in the year 
of our Lord one thousand nine hun­
dred and eleven, and of the independ­
ence of the United States of America, 
the one hundred and thirty-sixth.
“By the President:
“P. C. KNOX,
“Secretary of State.”

It has become quite the fad lately, 
especially among the members of the 
Plebe class to change and deface care­
fully made notices and signs posted 
on the bulletin board. The ones who 
do these things seem to think it ex­
ceedingly funny, and forget that it re­
quires considerable time to make some 
of these notices. The latest offense 
is the changing of the wording and 
time of a Crucible Club meeting, and 
it is hoped by the upper classmen 
that the Plebes who resort to this 
child’s, play will soon grow up, and 
find better use for their time.
This edition edited by W. H. BUENTE
In the last issue of the Campus, the 
weekly publication of Allegheny Col­
lege, there appeared an editorial 
headed “Unsportsmanlike Conduct of 
Tech Men.” It is not our intention 
to here discuss this editorial in de­
tail or to enter into a controversy 
with the Campus concerning the ar­
ticle on the details of the game. Such 
action would be as foolish as useless- 
it being impossible to obtain an un­
biased opinion upon any of these 
points. What we do wish to say is 
this. We have every confidence that 
the attitude of the Carnegie' players 
and coaches was that of sportsmen. 
In fact, as stated by the Campus, that 
Tech was penalized only once to Al­
legheny’s seven times is in itself 
enough to prove that our team played 
a clean game, the kind of a game that 
true sportsmen should play. We 
know, and it can be proven by writ- j 
ing to the Central Board, that the 
statement made by the Campus con-1 
cerning the choosing of the officials 
is false. We know also that the kind 
of sportsmanship shown by Allegheny 
in the writing of this editorial would 
not be tolerated at Carnegie.
The Tartan Publishes the Fol­
lowing Letter From the Director 
as a Public Recognition of Faithful 
and Valuable Service, and Wishes 
to Add Its Appreciation.
To the Editors of the Tartan:
Gentlemen:—I would like to send 
a few words of appreciation, for pub­
lication in your paper, concerning the 
valuable service which has been ren­
dered by one of the students of this 
school in the trying and arduous posi­
tion of Treasurer of the Athletic As­
sociation. Mr. Frederick R. Coggswell 
entered upon the duties of this post 
when the treasurership meant a com­
plete readjustment of the previous ac­
counts of the Association while there 
existed a considerable deficit in avail­
able working funds and at a time 
when it seemed desirable to inaugur­
ate a new system of accounting and 
purchasing.
Through his efficient and splendid 
efforts the funds of the Association 
have been carefully safeguarded. Al­
though compelled to devote a large 
amount of his time to outside work 
while attending his classes he has 
made the sacrifice which was de­
manded for him in filling this post 
with distinction, and I want to take 
this opportunity to bring his services 
to the attention of the entire student- 
body. I wish there were some other 
way in which we could express our 
admiration of his services since I be­
lieve it to have demanded more of 
his time and more continued effort 
than is ordinarily given by even the 
members of the Varsity teams who 
compete for the honor of their insti­
tution.
Yours very truly,
Arthur Arton Hamerschlag.
RENSSELAER COMES SATUR­
DAY.
Next Saturday’s game with Rens­
selaer will be the last home game of 
the season, and the rooting section 
should be the best filled of the year. 
This is the first appearance of the i 
Troy, N. Y., team in this city, al­
though their hockey representatives 
have been seen here before. A large 
crowd is expected as Rensselaer 
alumni abound in this vicinity. The 
contest will start at 2:30 P. M. This 
is the only game of the season, for 
which extra price will be asked. The
The Programs for the Game Will Be 
Sold By the Athletic Asso­
ciation.
The Rensselaer-Tech game will un­
doubtedly be the best of the season, 
as well as the last game on the home 
grounds. Inasmuch as there is con­
siderable expense connected with this 
game the Athletic Association have 
decided to sell the programs. It is 
up to every student attending the 
game to purchase a program and thus 
contribute to the fund of the Athletic 
Association.

CRUCIBLE CLUB.
A well attended and enjoyable meet­
ing of the Crucible Club was held last 
Friday evening in Room 212, at which 
time announcement was made that 
the club had obtained permission from 
Dean Leete to use Room 406 as a 
club room. Other business of the 
evening was the election of Howard
G. Texter to fill the vacant office of 
secretary of the club.
Dr. James read an article on “The 
Co-operative System,” in which stu­
dents of Technical Schools are ex­
pected to spend part of their time 
as apprentices in practical manufac­
turing plants. This was followed by 
a very interesting discussion of the 
merits and faults of the system.
After this the “eats” were served, 
in which all present showed a livelj' 
interest.

NEWS ITEMS OF GENERAL 
INTEREST.
The Schools were inspected last 
Thursday by two notable groups of 
visitors. One was the Royal Commis­
sion on Industrial Training and Tech­

Next week a special committee of 
the Chamber of Commerce of Erie, 
Penna., will make a study of the

In some unexplainable manner, the 
T. A. C. news became very badly con­
fused and tangled up by the time it 
appeared in print in last week’s Tar­
tan. However, be that as it may; we 
wish to publish, for the benefit of 
members a correct list of the two
committees, which were appointed at 
the last meeting. The Initiation Com­
mittee consists of Roguere. Rudolph, 
M. Jones, Fitzgibbons, and Challinor. 
The Competition Committee consists 
of Gehron, McGlenn and Button.
The club is having its constitution 
printed in a convenient pocket form 
and expects to have copies on hand 
for distribution among the members, 
within a short time.

In the committee meeting, which 
preceded the musicale, November 4, 
plans for the Alumnae Booth at the

CARNEGIE TECH SONGS.
Owing to the demand for the Song 
Books printed last year, the musical 
clubs have obtained another lot. These 
books are now on sale in the store­
room for five cents a copy. As this 
is the only printed list of Tech songs, 
it is advisable that everyone secure a 
copy immediately.
On Friday evening, November 3, 
the Industry Plebes held a smoker in 
honor of the upper classmen. It was 
held in the “Beanery” and a most 
enjoyable time was had.
This is an innovation in the Indus­
try School, and it is hoped that the 
occasion may be celebrated annually 
as it serves to bind the student-body 
more firmly together in college spirit ! 
and good fellowship.
Shortly after eight o’clock, after all 
had been supplied with smokes in 
one form or another, a short musical 
program was given. After this the 
attention was taken up by a few box­
ing bouts. “English” Fagan and 
Brown mixed it up for three rounds. 
“Runt” James and Jones succeeded 
them in the ring, and the youngsters 
handled themselves well. Patterson 
and Price gave a scientific exhibition 
of boxing. The refreshments fol­
lowed. During the evening short 
talks were given by Mr. Nolan, Mr. 
Smith, Mr. Pfouts and Mr. Irwin.
Mr. Ted Heuber, president of the 
upper classmen, and Mr. Voelker, 
Plebe president, also gave short talks.

Crawford tackled Spurney on Re­
serve’s 50 mark. Four more punts 
were opened up and Backowski stop­
ped with the ball 30 yards from our 
goal. A forward pass, Stroup to Alle- 
mann, cut this distance in two. Spur­
ney gained 4 yards, then Stroup faked 
a forward pass and made the first 
touch-down. Schulman failed to kick 
goal.
Schmucker kicked off to the 5 mark, 
but Snider returned 20 yards. Hoag- 
land’s punt was blocked, and Kessel- 
man recovered on Reserve’s 20-yard 
line. Balsinger gained 3 yards, but 
Atch failed to gain. A forward pass 
Lucas to Kesselman, netted only 5 
yards, and the ball went to Reserve 
on downs. Hoagland kicked to our 
43-yard line. The half ended with 
the score: Western Reserve, 5; Car­
negie Tech, 0.
Evans appeared in Backowski’s 
place, and Hoagland kicked off. 
Schmucker punted in return to Re­
serve’s 20-yard line, from which place 
Spurney carried the ball 43 yards on 
three runs. Snider gained 6 more, 
then Schmucker upset all calculations 
by leaping into the air some — feet, 
more or less, and grabbing a forward 
pass. No one could stop him until 
he had gained 25 yards. Atch and 
Balsinger each made a small gain, and 
Schmucker’s kick was blocked. Spur­
ney failed to gain, but Carnegie was 
penalized for holding. A forward pass, 
Snider to Allemann, gained 7 yards 
to our 53 line. ¦ Snider cut it down 
10, but a forward pass reached the 
ground untouched, and Reserve was 
set back 10 units for holding. Hoag­
land kicked to Atch, and Schmucker 
returned to Stevens, who brought the 
ball back 22 yards to within 3 units 
of our goal. Stevens gained 1 yard, 
and Stroup was pushed over for a 
touchdown. Schulman again missed 
goal.
De Muth was sent in for Welch, 
and Schmucker kicked off, allowing 
the new guard to get his man for no 
gain on Reserve’s 23 line. Hoagland 
punted, and Schulman recovered the 
ball out of bounds on their 53 mark. 
Geraci replaced Allemann. Stroup 
gained 9 yards and Snider made first 
down. A forward pass failed just as 
the whistle ended the quarter. Score: 
Reserve, 10; Carnegie, 0.
The last period started with Re­
serve’s ball on second down on our 
47 Jine. Hoagland punted and Port- 
man recovered. Reserve was penal­
ized 15 yards for some offense. A for­
ward pass, Stroup to Hanley, gained 
but 1 yard, but Snider added 4. Stroup 
attempted a field goal, but didn’t come 
near. Schmucker’s punt was blocked 
and Reserve recovered the ball 15 
yards from our goal after a dispute. 
Knight started a forward pass to Ger­
aci that the latter -carried over the 
line. Knight failed to kick goal in the 
darkness. The referee decided to call 
the game with one minute to play.

It took men a long time to realize that a Dress Suit was not a luxury to be enjoyed only
by the man with seventy-five or more dollars to plank down to a custom tailor.
We are not decrying the custom tailor’s product, for it was he who set the standard for
us to follow, but the Dress Suit business is now commercialized till you can get as good Suits as-
any man needs at about half the old price.
Dress Suits have become an important feature of our clothing business, and they are fitted: 
as easily and satisfactorily as Sack Suits—made of fine Imported specially woven Worsteds, hand 
tailored thruout.
Prices—$38.00 and $48.00.

THE DAY DRAFTSMEN’S CLUB.
With a full attendance, the Drafts­
men’s Club held a very important 
meeting November 15, 1911.
The committee appointed to draft 
a suitable constitution and by-laws, 
reported at this meeting, and with but 
slight changes, their work was 
adopted.
As this was an important subject, 
taking more time than was expected; 
no other business was brought before 
the club.
Too Bad.
A noted sociologist tells the follow­
ing story of a woman in a Southern 
manufacturing town. Approaching her 
for statistics, he asked—“Madam, 
have you any children?”
“No,” she replied. “I have to work 
in the factory myself.”—Life.
