VARSITY WINS FROM PENN STATE; LOSES TO LEHIGH ANO LAFAYETTE
Good Batting With Excellent 
Team Work Gives Tech 
Superiority
FINAL SCORE IS 7 TO 6
For the first time in several years 
the Carnegie Tech team succeeded in 
removing a game from Penn State’s 
possession in a free hitting contest at 
Penn State, last Thursday. Osborne, 
appearing for the first time on the 
IPlaid nine, pitched a game which is 
an indication of great prowess in the 
future. Although the weather was 
•quite cool, he seemed to be handi­
capped very little. He held State 
scoreless and with only one hit until 
the fifth inning, when two hits were 
•secured, but no runs.
Penn State secured their first two 
runs in the sixth inning, when with 
two men out and one on first, Adams, 
a Pittsburgh boy playing first, came 
through with a hit which advanced the 
man on first and both were brought in 
by a succeeding hit. One more tally 
¦was added for State in the sixth by 
and error, and three more tacked on 
in the ninth.
In both fielding and- hitting Tech 
could not have been surpassed as they 
appeared at State College.
Doherty was first man up and came 
through with a hit, but the men fol­
lowing were unable to lift the ball out 
of the infield and were thrown out at 
first. A similar offense was committed 
the second inning -when Gano had a 
hit.
The third inning, however, saw the 
Plaid tossers getting their eyes on the 
ball and when the smoke blew away 
Tech had annexed a lead of two runs, 
to which they added five more in the 
sixth.
Hird was sent in in the seventh in­
ning to relieve Osborne after he had 
pitched two men out. The weather

After Victory Team Suffers 
Reverse Due to Over­
confidence
BOTH GAMES SLOW
The Liigh ball pitched by Johnson for 
Lehigh University seemed to be a bug­
bear to the Carnegie team on Friday. 
Fresh from a victory at State they 
were so eager to swat the ball that 
they were unable to resist the tempta­
tion of a swing and to wait them out. 
As a result tLie Tech nine was able to 
secure only four scattered hits, two 
of which were sent scampering into 
the lot by Yeager and left the score 
5-1.
Lyons seemed quite unable to fol­
low Johnson’s example for strike-outs 
and allowed several men to walk up 
to the sixth inning when Hird was 
sent in. but he likewise was unable to 
stop an onslaught from the South 
Bethlehem aggregation.
The Lafayette Game.
On Saturday the team was doomed 
to undergo even a worse drubbing, for 
Lafayette, who up to that^t-ime had 
played a very poor brand of basebaHr 
had an unusual day. Coupled with the 
fact that the team had made long 
jumps and the men were therefore 
tired, almost every man on "the team 
was nursing sore arms due to the ex­
tremely cold weather. The game was 
slow, many errors intervening to make 
the game uninteresting. The victors 
themselves played a brand of ball 
which on any other occasion would 
not have gotten away with anything 
but a defeat and everyone was any­
thing but sad when the game was 
ended.
DR. ATCHISON LECTURES AT WOMAN’S SCHOOL
Dr. Atchison, president of the 
Pennsylvania College for Women, 
lectured last Wednesday morning, at 
the M. M. C. S. on the people of thé 
Appalachian mountains—their homes, 
dialects, feud and customs, and the 
beauty and natural resources of the 
country. Dr. Atchison worked 
among these people for 20 years 
¦while establishing and building up a 
Woman’s College there and is there­
fore, very able to talk about them 
and their great needs—the greatest 
of which are, he says, education, so­
cial intercourse and sane religious 
ideas.
UPPER CLASS TO HOLD GET-TOGETHER DINNER
The members of the upper class 
of the Industrial School will hold a 
get-together dinner tomorrow (Thurs­
day) evening, at The Laurel. A good 
turnout is anticipated as this is the 
first affair of its kind to be held this 
year and will be followed at a later 
date, by the annual class banquet.
DIRECTOR LEETE SPEAKS AT JUNIOR BANQUET
The annual Junior Banquet of the 
School of Applied Science was held 
last Wednesday night, April 25, in 
the' Dutch room of the Fort Pitt 
Hotel. The entire class of 1918, or 
about 80 men, were present with 
their appetites and plenty of pep.
After an excellent dinner Presi­
dent Todd, acting as toastmaster 
welcomed back former Dean Leete, 
who spoke on “Tech’s Part in the 
War,” laying special emphasis upon 
the fact that Tech stood forth from 
among other colleges and universities 
as the ono college in which the de­
mand for military training came from 
the student body itself. He also point­
ed to the fine group of experts of our 
faculty wo could supply to Uncle 
Sam in case of actual need.
The program was as follows:

CENTRAL COUNCIL HAS FIRST MEETING; T. E. ORR NOW HEADS STUDENT BODY
Miss Willis Appointed Chair­
man of Committee to Or­
ganize Red Cross Auxili­
ary in Four Schools
QUALIFICATION DAY IS SET
Founder’s Day marked the estab­
lishment of our first all school stu­
dent government. Last Thursday 
afternoon the central council met and 
organized with Orr at their head as 
vice president. They decided to 
push the plan for a Red Cross aux­
iliary in the four schools. They set 
May 11 as Qualification Day. They 
recognized the present military af­
fairs committee as official and em­
powered to act for the student body. 
Finally the council authorized an 
assessment of five cents on every 
day student in order to meet the ex­
penses of organizing and running the 
council.
This first meeting of the council 
had been previously delayed, because

COMEDY COSTUMING AT DISGUISE REVEL
Many original and spectacular pos­
ters called together the fun-loving 
members of the School of Design on 
Thursday evening, April 26. From 
start to finish it was a glorious con­
glomeration of dancing and fun. It 
was a “Comedy Disguise Revel” and 
the comedy was there sure enough, 
but there did not seem to be much 
trouble about the disguise when it 
came to fixing up dances.
The revelers appeared in every­
thing from an ear-ring or long nose 
to a waiste basket creation of most 
brilliant colors. Between the mad 
frolics, flocking toward the over­
flowing bowl, one would see a maid 
of the sixties in pink with panta­
lettes trip gaily by^ with the “just 
now popular” United States Marine. 
They chatted gaily with the striking 
“Queen of Hearts,” who was accom­
panied by her attentive colored ser­
vant.
In the quiet of the balcony, was

FOUNDER'S HAV SPEECHES DEAL WITH GREAT WARPLANS COMPLETED FOR NIGHT SCHOOL SOIREE
America’s Debt to France 
Brought Home by the Sing­
ing of the Marseillaise
America’s debt to France was the 
keynote of the twenty-first Founder’s 
Day exercises at Carnegie Music 
Hall, last Thursday. The large audi­
ence, consisting of many people prom­
inent in Pittsburgh’s industries and 
professions, absorbed the spirit of the 
occasion, and applauded vigorously 
the frequent tributes that were paid 
to France in accordance with the 
proclamation of Governor Brumbaugh 
setting aside that day' as “the day 
when we should do honor to France.” 
The enthusiasm of the audience 
reached its highest pitch when Mad­
ame Esta Ferrabini, soprano of the 
Boston Opera Company, appeared on 
the stage dressed in a costume of 
Freuch flags, and sang “The Mar­
seillaise." This was but one of the 
many features on the program.
The principal address was deliv­
ered by George W. Perkins, former 
chairman of the Progressive National 
Committee. His subject was to have 
been “The Man and the Future,” but 
by request of the committee, this 
¦was changed to “Our Supreme Test.” 
Mr. Perkins discussed the serious 
food problem that is" now confronting 
our nation and suggested individual 
temperance in eating as one method 
of combatting the food shortage. Mr. 
Perkins, who for two years was J 
chairman of the New York State' 
Food Commission, said in part: “I do 
not think I am exaggerating in the 
least when I say that as the planting 
of our food crops goes in the next 
four or five weeks, so will the Euro­
pean war go.”
In his address on “Our Debt to 
France,” Mr. James M. Beck, who 
was assistant attorney general in 
President McKinley’s cabinet and 
who was in Europe during the early 
stages of the war, eulogized the spirit 
which prompted Lafayette and others 
to come to our aid during our days 
of trouble and emphasized the im­
portance of immediate American aid 
to France in this war. His sugges­
tion that at least a division of Ameri­
can volunteers should be sent to 
France under the leadership of Theo-

Novelty Dancing to be One 
of the Big Features 
At This Affair
RELAY TEAM RUNS SECOND TO COLGATE; HAUB THIRD IN OPEN HIGH JUMP
Preparations for the first “get- 
together” dance or “soiree” to be 
given by the night students of the 
four schools are rapidly nearing com­
pletion.
The clever posters announcing the 
event which appeared in each of the 
buildings last Tuesday evening were 
the work of night Design students, 
who are also planning some equally 
neat designs for the programs.
Tech spirit and democracy will be 
the order of the evening and the 
large crowd which has already 
planned to attend will be quickly 
put at its ease and intermingled with 
several Paul Jones dances early in 
the evening.
Quite a number of senior science 
men have already asked the commit­
tee to furnish them with partners 
and others who cannot dance will be 
on hand just to show tlieir Tech 
spirit and to prove that the grind 
of night work has not completely 
killed all their capacity for enjoy­
ment.
There will be quite a little “novelty* 
dancing.” Anyone doubting this 
need only watch some of the Indus-, 
tries and Science men in their fran­
tic endeavors to appear completely at 
their ease while struggling valiantly 
but unsuccessfully to avoid stepping 
all over their fair partner’s footgoar.
Good music has been promised 
from Nirella’s Orchestra and soino 
“perfectly safe” punch will be dis­
pensed in the usual quantities.
Students desiring to attend are 
urged to see their class presidents at 
once and secure their admission 
cards. The dance will be gratis to 
all night students and their partners, 
who need not necessarily be Tech 
students. All expense is to be car­
ried by a few students who have con­
tributed to a fund for this purpose.
No cards of admission will be 
given out after Friday evening, May 
4th.
The Margaret Morrison girls are 
making all arrangements for chap­
erones and expect to turn out In 
force themselves.
The dance Is to be Informal.
New Heads of Tartan Staff
PAUL H. ARMOR.
Last Thursday at a meeting of 
THE TARTAN staff, Paul H. Ar­
mour, sophomore in the Science 
school was appointed Editor-in-Chief, 
and Nelson P. Rice business manager 
for the ensuing year. Both of these 
men have been doing excellent work 
on the paper for the past year. There 
was some keen competition for the 
position of EditOr-in-Chief, and the 
question of picking the right man
NELSON P. RICE.
presented a difficult problem. It is 
regretable that in a competition of 
this sort that somebody has to lose.
Previous to this year it had been 
the custom to also choose the re­
mainder of the staff positions for the 
ensuing year. The editor, however, 
felt that it would be more satisfac­
tory and efficient for'the new editor 
to pick his staff, consequently it will 
be two weeks before an entirely new 
staff will go into operation.
FIRST YEAR NIGHT MEN PLAN BANQUET SATURDAY
The first year night class of the 
Science School will hold their first 
banquet at the Seventh Avenue Hotel 
Saturday evening, May 5th. Prep 
students as well as first year night 
men are eligible to attend. The com­
mittee in charge consists of Iiagel, 
Kilroy, Carter, Cunningham and Co­
hen.
M. M. C. S. NOMINATIONS FOR SENATE WEDNESDAY
At the assembly of May 2, the 
M. M. C. S. students will hold nomi­
nations for their Senate officers for 
next year—the elections taking place 
the following week. All class and 
activities officers will also be elected 
within the next few weeks.
PLEBE MEET STARTS BUT RAIN INTERRUPTS
The Plebes were only half suc­
cessful in defeating the hoodoo that 
has been following their track meet. 
After having been postponed twice, 
the meet was interrupted last Wed­
nesday by a . thunder storm. Six 
events had been run off, however, be­
fore the rain forced spectators and 
participants to seek shelter in the 
gymnasium. The summary of these 
events:

PITT DEFEATS VARSITY IN FIRST OF SERIES
Darlington Pitches Excellent 
Game But Receives 
Poor Support
GANO MAKES HOME RUN
In an exciting baseball game on 
Trees Stadium, before a large crowd, 
Pitt defeated Tech 5 to 2, aided with 
Tech errors and supplemented by Pitt 
hits. As usual In games between 
these two rivals, the breaks favored 
Pitt. The Skibos had simply no ox- 
cuse for losing, with the score 2 to 0 
in their favor at the end of the second 
and Darlington going strong on the 
mound. But two errors by Ivesner in 
the second, errors by Zehfuss and 
Darlington, three hits and a base on 
balls in the third and—Zing went the 
ball game.
Gano and Yeager featured for Tech. 
Gano’s mighty drive into left field in 
the second inning was good for four 
bases. Yeager playing middle field 
for Tech, laid on his back against the 
hillside and napped Sles’ long smash. 
Tech’s other run came In the first on 
Frledlander’s error and Withers’ sin­
gle, Doherty crossing the pan.
Darlington pitched a fine game and 
deserved to win, but six errors back 
of him spoiled his chances. I-Ie al­
lowed but two earned runs, struck

FORMER STUDENT AGAIN SINGS MIKADO ROLE
Miss Olive A. Sllngluff, who sang 
the role of Katisha in the produc­
tion of the opera, “Mikado,” in May 
of last year and at class night, will 
sing the same rolo in Columbia, Mo., 
on May 28. In addition she will di­
rect the entire cast and chorus for 
a week before the production. The 
cast is composed of girls from Chris­
tian College and men from Missouri 
State University. Miss Sllngluff Is 
supervisor of music in Hays Normal 
school, Kansas.
Last Saturday the Carnegie Tech 
relay team took second place in. its 
class, in the one mile relay at the 
Twenty-third Annual Relay Race Car­
nival, held under the auspices of the 
University of Pennsylvania at Frank­
lin Field, Philadelphia. E. I-Iaub rep­
resented Tech in the high jump 
which was open to all classes, and 
tied for third place in a field of over 
forty competitors, which represented 
such colleges as Pennsylvania, Penn 
State, Lafayette, Illinois, Dartmouth, 
Syracuse, Pitt and Lehigh, and in­
cidentally the winner, Larson, of 
Brigham Young, would undoubtedly 
have broken the world’s record in 
this event had it not been for the 
misfortune that the number on tho 
back of his shirt caught the cross 
bar, during his last leap.
The showing of the men at this 
meet was very good, particularly the 
work of I-Iaub in tho high jump. The 
one-mile relay raco in which Tech 
participated, started promptly at 
4:15 p. m. The collegos represented 
In this class were—Carnegie Tech, 
Ohio, Wosloyan, Lohlgh, Colgate, Vir­
ginia Military Institute, College City 
of New York, Lafayette and Rutgers.

SHINKLE HEADS NIGHT DRILL
At a mass meeting the past week it 
was unanimously decided to order uni­
forms for the students taking military 
drill. The reason for acting quickly 
was to avoid paying excessive prices 
for uniforms, which will be in effect 
everywhere when the government or­
ders become large. For seven dollars 
and a half ($7.50) each, regulation uni­
forms, blouse and shoos oinltlod, will 
bo purchased. Those students not ablt

It Is a distinct advantage for eac’ 
student to purchase Ills own outfit,

THE PAST YEAR
In our first editorial, at the beginning of the school year, we out­
lined our policy for the year which is now passing. We proposed to 
do all in our power to bring the four schools nearer together; we 
proposed and urged the adoption of an all-school government, and 
with the aid oi: the Seannachic Society this has now become a reality. 
However, this is our last editorial, for which reason we are going to 
say now what we will not have another chance to say. When we 
said Seannachic Society, we really meant Tom Orr, and Ii. B. Pearce. 
These are the men who really did the work. The Seannachic Society 
itself lias been a dead issue for at least the past two years, the work 
it has done has been negligible, the leadership particularly during 
the last year has been poor, and the all-scliool government takes away 
its very excuse for existence.
However, to come back to where we started, we feel that we 
have really done something toward bringing the four schools nearer 
together. It is, however, our sincere desire that the future years will 
do even more in this respect and that some day the Industries School 
will take a part in the Junior Prom. We not only hope this, but we 
really predict it.
Another one ol' our policies was to bring about a better system of 
school elections; we also believe that with the instalation of The 
Tarlan system of elections that this has been brought about.
We furthermore expressed a desire to aid in every way possible 
the Y. M. (!. A. movement; to this end we held lengthy correspon 
deuce, we interviewed secretaries and then with this information we 
went to the Y. M. A., with the suggestion to aid them.. After re­
pealed efforts to co-operate with them, and after never receiving 
even a sign of interest on their part, we gave up this task for a “bad 
job,” coming to the conclusion that this bunch meant well, and that’s 
about all. A Y. M. A. is a line tiling and is needed at Tech, but 
it will never be a success il! carried on the way it has been started
Wo have at all times done what wo considered would lie to the 
best interest ol! Tech. We feel we have succeeded and wc wish to 
thank the student body, the faculty, and the administration for the 
support and assistance they have at all times given us.
Oar last wish is: “May the Tech spirit always maintain ils pres­
ent high standard.”
THE RED CROSS BALL
There has been some misunderstanding concerning the Red Cro,ss 
Ball; and lest that lack oil knowledge should result in lack of support, 
wc shall go into particulars as given in the announcement of the Ball. 
It is a dance for the four classes of the four schools, to be given in 
the Music Iiall on Friday evening, May 11. It, is neither a formal nor 
a costume affair. The proceeds are to be devoted to the work of the 
Red Cross, and, if the Tech Auxiliary is organized in time, will form 
part of the funds of that society.
The cause is worthy of all the support which every man can offer.
THE CENTRAL COUNCIL
The Night Tech. Design Club met 
on Wednesday evening, April 25th, 
to complete the oganization of the 
club. There was a large attendance 
of the night students, and enthu­
siasm was the keynote of the even­
ing.
The office of publicity manager yet 
remained to be filled, and to this of­
fice Agnes K. O'Malley was unani­
mously elected. Two more commit­
tees were appointed, viz.: Tours and 
Social. The Tours Committee con­
sists of three students and the club 
instructor (the latter as yet to be se­
lected), who will exert their efforts 
in an endeavor to. seek out the most 
desirable places for the sketching 
work.
The Social Committee, with Miss 
B. Pengra as chairman, bids the club 
anticipate many good times in con­
nection with its work, as picnics, 
hikes, tennis parties, etc., are heing 
planned.
An important feature of Wednes­
day’s meeting was the adoption by 
the Club of a distinctive insignia, 
which is to be submitted to the De­
partment of Painting and Decoration 
for approval and adoption. The pur­
pose is to use this design on all. 
work of the night students, thus giv­
ing the night . work a recognition 
heretofore not accorded.
The spirit of goodfellowsliip that 
prevails throughout the club augurs 
well for its future success. The 
next meeting, which is to be on Wed­
nesday night, May 2, at nine o’clock 
sharp, promise to be the best at­
tended and most successful one so 
far. Every night student of the De­
partment of Painting and Decoration 
is expected to come and submit for 
consideration some new ideas for the 
welfare of the club.

RELAY TEAM RUNS
SECOND TO.COLGATE
INTER-SCHOOL MEET 
WON BY SCIENCE
The inauguration of the new all-schools council constitutes one 
of the most important events of the school year. Obscured as it is 
now by the general military enthusiasm, the event passed almost, un­
noticed ; hut nevertheless the council is already busy, and is actively 
working 011 many all-school matters which have been accumulatin 
for several years. For example, the council finds that Plebe Qualifica­
tion Day has been in past years an entirely haphazard affair. This 
year the council hopes to co-ordinate the efforts of each school, and 
particularly to provide some means by which the Margaret Morrison 
Plebcs may participate. Council hopes to lay down certain standard 
rules-for future Plebe Regulations, which rules can be adopted to 
suit the conditions in each school, and again particularly in the girls’ 
school. It is in just such ways as this that the council is of greatest 
value; it can standardize things throughout the four schools wherever 
standardization means efficiency.
A second question which will como before the council, and 
especially the committee on by-laws, is that of school elections. At 
the beginning of the school year each of the men's schools adopted 
The Tartan system of elections, and followed out that system faith­
fully for several months. Apparently, the interest then subsided; 
and when the novelty of the system had worn away, its provisions 
were disregarded by practically everyone except the Science School, 
and even by some classes there. When a system whose value is so 
clearly apparent has been legally adopted, it should be remembered. 
It is true that there has been some inconvenience owing to the fact 
that the school assemblies occur 011 the same day that The Tartan 
is published, but this difficulty is not insurmountable. The council 
i committee 011 by-laws should provide a uniform election code for 
- the four schools, and, above all, see that that code is obeved.\ „
The Science School, last Friday, 
won the Eighth Annual Inter-school 
Meet, the first to be run off on the 
new track. There was much good 
material brought to the front. Law­
son of Science and Lingenfelser of 
Industry, each winning two events 
and thereby making themselves the 
individual stars of the meet. The 
Relay race was run between Science 
and Industries, the Design School 
not having their full number of men. 
This was oasily the best race of the 
day not being decided until the last 
second; Obert of Science, just nosing 
out his opponent. Science scored 78 
points, Industry 30, and Design 18.

FOUNDER’S DAY SPEECHES
DEAL WITH GREAT WAR
(Continued from Page One) 
dore Roosevelt was greeted with en­
thusiastic applause.
Greetings were read- from “Uncle 
Andy” and messages of regret be­
cause of inability to attend, from 
such famous men as Arthur James 
Balfour, French ambassador Jusser- 
and, French Minister of War Vivi- 
anni, and General Joffre, all of whom 
are attending the war council at 
Washington.
Senor Dr. Porras, minister plenipo­
tentiary from Panama to the United 
States, who Avas. to bring a “greet­
ing from our Central American 
Ally,” was also unable to attend be­
cause of pressing business affairs in 
Washington. The organ had been 
draped with the flag of Panama, be­
sides. those of the United States,, 
Cuba, France and England, in his 
honor, and his absence was much .re­
gretted.
Among the notables present was 
Dr. John A. Brasliear, whose interest­
ing trip to the Orient was described 
in. recent issues of the “Tartan.” 
“Uncle John” stood for a short time 
before the statute of “Uncle Andy” 
in the foyer and greeted many of his 
friends as they entered.
Music was furnished by the or­
chestra of our school and by Charles 
Heirtroth, who played the organ. The 
meeting closed with “The Star 
Spangled Banner,” the orchestra and 
the organ playing together.
Col. Samuel Harden Church was 
the chairman. The invocation was 
delivered by Rev. Robert McGowan 
of the Bellefield Presbyterian Church.
In a. letter to The Tartan, Carl 
S. Peters now at Freemont, Ohio, 
writes that he is attempting to organ­
ize a Toledo Alumni Clan. There 
are three graduates near the city, 
Peters, Britscli, Design ’16, and 
Vernon, Industries ’15.

THREE ART EXHIBITIONS 
OPENED FOUNDER’S DAY
The Founder’s Day Exhibition at 
Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, which 
opened on April 26, is quite different 
in character from any other Found­
er's Day Exhibition presented by the 
Department of Fine Arts. It includes 
a collection of Early English Por­
traits and Landscapes lent by Mr. 
John H. McFadden of Philadelphia, a 
collection of Old English Colour 
Prints also lent by Mr. McFadden, 
and the recent accessions made by 
the Department of Fine Arts.
Mr. McFadden's collection is the 
most representative in America of 
the richest period of English art— 
that of the eighteenth century. We 
find in this collection every artist of 
proriiinence who painted during the 
period covered by the collection. It 
is strongest in the canvases of Con­
stable, Romney, and Raeburn. Gains­
borough is well represented by a 
landscape and a portrait. The other 
painters whose pictures aré included 
are: David Cox, John Crome, Sir 
John Watson Gordon, George Henry 
Harlow, William Hogarth. John Hopp- 
ner, . Sir. Thomas Lawrence. John 
Linnell, George Morland, Sir Joshua 
Reynolds, James Stark, George 
Stubbs, J. M. W. Turner, William 
Williams and Richard Wilson.
The recent accessions made by the ; 
Department of Fine Arts are too nu­
merous for individual mention. There 
are seven paintings in oil represent­
ing Henry Golden Dearth, Horatio 
Walker, and the late Alfred S. Wall 
of Pittsburgh. The accessions to the 
Print Department are most import­
ant. The engravings include prints 
by Mantegna, Schongauer, Durer, 
Mard Antonio Raimondi, and Nan- 
teuil. The etchings represent many 
periods and many schools. There 
are three prints by Van Dyck, a num­
ber of etchings by the Dutch artists 
of the seventeenth century, a. good 
representation of nineteenth century 
French artists including Millet, Jac- 
que, Bracquemond, Buhot, Legros, 
Lepere, and the unrivalled Meryon. 
Etchings by many modern masters 
are shown notably those of Whistler, 
Zorn, Bauer, Brangwyn, J. Andre 
Smith, James McBey, Max Slevogt, 
Emil Orlik, John Sloan, and John 
Marin. Lithographs by George Bel­
lows, Ludwig von Hoffman, Millet, 
Fantin-Latour, and Will Rotlienstein 
are also shown. Among the. eighty- 
three drawings we find many of un­
usual merit and interest. There is a 
group of fifty-eight drawings by Anton 
Mauve, the great Holland painter. 
These drawings represent Mauve’s 
life work in this field and constitute 
an extremely important and beauti­
ful collection interesting alike to the 
art lover and the art student. Seven 
of Joseph Pennell’s Alhambra series 
are included, two drawings . by 
Charles Shannon, two .by Maurice 
Sterne, three by Alfred S. Wall,; and 
single representations by Ernest 
Cole, Eugene Higgins, Winslow Hom­
er, Augustus John, John F. Kensett, 
John La Farge, William Rothenstein 
and. Alexander T. Steinlen. In the 
same room are eleven bronzes pur­
chased from the recent exhibition of 
American sculpture. Seventy-nine 
drawings representing Cathedral 
stained glass windows in France and 
England by Mr. Lawrence B. Saint 
are also shown. The Japanese prints 
on exhibition include some of the 
rmost famous works of Hiroshige, 
Hokusai, Kiyonaga and Utamaro. In 
the Balcony above the Hall of Sculp­
ture is installed the collection of six 
hundred and fifty-three Greek photo­
graphs.
The Founder’s- Day Exhibition 
which has ranked as a nationajly im­
portant art event for many years has 
maintained its prestige even though 
tiie troubled times since 1914, have 
not permitted the usual international 
exhibitions. Much credit to the suc­
cess of the present exhibition is due 
to the generosity of Mr. McFadden in 
lending his collection to Carnegie 
Institute. Furthermore the acces­
sions made by the * Department of 
Fine Arts are unusüal both in num­
ber and aesthetic interest. The 
Founder’s Day Exhibition will con­
tinue through June 15.

EDITOR’S NOTE:—This article 
was originally presented by Mr. Bra­

Department. Because of its excel­
lence, the editors asked permission to 
publish it, in order that the entire stu­
dent body might'read it and become 
more familiar with engineering as a 
profession.
Ross-Gould
_ MailingLisisSt. Louis
The selection by a student o£ such 
a subject as the status of tjie engineer 
(the importance of which need not be 
impressed), might properly appear 
rather presumptuous. The presenta­
tion'-o£ it would much more fittingly 
come from an engineer of wide experi­
ence. But in lieu of such experience 
I have consulted those of such famous 
engineers as Dr. J. A. L. Waddell, Dr. 
G. F. Swain, C. D. Marx, Ernest Mc­
Cullough, and others—men who might 
properly be classed as the aristocracy 
of the Engineering Profession. Hence 
the opinions expressed in the body of 
this paper will be understood to be 
those of these engineers.
The phrase, “status of the engineer,” 
may be interpreted to mean either the 
standing of the engineer as it appears 
to his fellow-citizens, or it may mean 
his standing as it would appear to an 
observer seeing facts as they are, 
without exaggeration, without diminu­
tion, without distortion. It is the well- 
known distinction between reputation 
and character. Reputation is the image 
of the man as he appears to those 
about him; character is the man him­
self. Either interpretation is of prime 
interest to the engineer. Both will be 
considered.
While engineering is certainly the 
oldest of all the professions, in that 
it dates back to the, time when the 
prehistoric man first "performed his 
simple constructions in stone and tim­
ber, it is really the youngest of the 
so-called learned professions. In the 
minds of the people at large it is not 
even yet well enough defined to he 
placed in the same class with Law, 
Divinity, and Medicine. To the
bucolic mind the land surveyor and 
the engineer are one, while the loco­
motive runner is looked upon as a 
rather higher type of engineer. To 
most people the name—engineer—ap­
plies to all men who operate steam or 
electric machinery- or who survey 
land, equally with those who locate 
and construct railroads, design 
bridges, water-works, sewers, and “di­
rect the great sources of power in na­
ture for the use and convenience of 
man.” An instrument man giving ele­
vations represents the typical engineer 
to the public far more definitely than 
would a sight of the cliief-engineer in 
his office.
This condition of affairs gives rise 
to the opinion prevalent throughout 
the ranks of the profession that the 
true status of the engineer is not rec­
ognized by those about him, that the 
work he has done and is doing in the 
world entitles him to a larger place 
in the public view than he has hitherto 
occupied and to a larger share-in the 
administrative work of the nation, 
state, local community, and of the 
great railway and industrial corpora­
tions.
What is then tne concensus of opin­
ion as to how the status of the en­
gineer may be improved? First is it 
possible to educate the public to an 
understanding of the qualifications of 
a real engineer? Can the people be 
taught to appreciate the services of 
competent engineers? This might be 
possible only through furnishing the 
public correct information as to -the 
abilities of able members of their pro­
fession. This work would be best car­
ried out by the national engineering 
societies.
To therman on .thevstreet the Ameri­
can Society of Civil Engineers, the 
American Society of Mechanical En­
gineers, the American Institute of 
Electrical Engineers, and the . Ameri­
can Institute of Mining Engineers are 
in the same class as the Master Car 
and Locomotive Painters’ Association, 
the American Foundrymen’s Associa­
tion, the Society of Automobile En­
gineers, etc.—the number of which is 
legion-. In view of this condition, it 
is the opinion of^tlie average engineer 
that the societies are not raising the 
standard of the profession in the es­
timation of the general public. They 
spend most of their time and money 
in doing honor to members who bave 
already won their spurs.
In order to give the public correct 
information it has been suggested that 
the national engineering societies 
maintain a Publicity Bureau for the 
distribution of the proper literature 
for the advancement of the profession. 
Capable press agents should reiterate 
and impress upon the public mind the 
importance of the engineers' work. It 
might appear as if such action would 
entail the loss of some dignity on the 
part of the societies, but if it tends to 
enhance the welfare of the profession 
in general, such slight loss would be 
more than repaid.
Further, the societies might make 
membership in them of increasing 
value by exerting themselves to direct 
public policy in economic questions 
along sound lines of development. The 
societies as a group might also co­
operate for the purpose of recom­
mending, deprecating or condoning 
legislation relating to the engineering 
profession.
At this point a few remarks on the 
licensing of engineers might be perti­
nent. It seems to be the opinion of 
the leading engineers that the license 
system would not eliminate the unfit. 
Tn their judgment an engineer is not 
evolved through a theoretical educa­
tion or through years of practice, but 
through a proper balance of both, and 
such knowledge can only be judged 
through actual performance. The 
cases of lawyers and doctors have al­
ways been cited as examples of the 
benefits of the license system. But 
such comparison is evidently unfair. 
There are no doubt proportionately as 
many incompetent and irresponsible 
persons among these two profes­
sions as there are incapable per­
sons calling themselves engineers. 
Doctor's mistakes lie "beneath the 
sod,” lawyer's failures are lost in the 
voluminous records of the higher 
courts, but the blunders of the self- 
styled engineer are neither buried 
nor hidden, and he must stand before 
the world convicted by the work of his 
own hands.
Another fruitful subject for discus­
sion in technical literature is the 
small compensation paid engineers 
for their services. Engineers like the 
rest of humanity desire fair if no.t lib­
eral remuneration. According to Prof. 
Swain the compensation of engineers 
is not as large as that of the doctors 
or lawyers, for the simple reason that 
the engineer does not appeal to senti­
ment which is so potent a factor in the 
other professions. Probably the most 
powerful emotions of the human being 
are fear, love, avarice and vanity. The 
law appeals to all of them; medicine 
appeals to fear and love; architecture 
appeals to vanity; engineering ap­
peals to none.
The remoteness of the benefit to be 
derived from a piece of engineering 
work makes its importance indistinct 
to the public vision. The design of a 
bridge is so far removed from its use 
in traffic that the public seldom con­
nects the engineer with commerce 
and human travel; the survey of a 
reservoir site is not vividly enough 
related to the growing of crops on an 
irrigation project or the use of water 
from a fawcet in the house, to make 
vivid in the mind of the public the use­
fulness of the engineer. Neither does 
the hazy concept of the part taken 
by the engineer in these enterprises 
permit the public to appreciate the 
amount of intelligence and labor de­
voted to the design and the survey. 
The public seldom searches deeply for 
facts, and it is impressed on the aver­
age only by obvious truths. This-is 
why the services of the engineer to hu­
manity are little understood and poor­
ly compensated. The engineer's only 
remedy for this trouble is to get the 
facts before the public through «a judic­
ious use of the press, of the- Bchool, 
and of literature, as already suggested.
On the other hand, engineers them­
selves are to a considerable extent re­
sponsible for this lamentable condi­
tion. Chief engineers of corporations 
endeavor to hire engineering help at 
the lowest possible wage, in order to 
make a record for economy; and there­
by enhance their own value in (lie 
eyes of their employers. To make 
this concrete I wiish to quote from 
the report of the Special Committee 
to investigate the conditions of employ­
ment and the compensation of civil 
engineers of the American Society of 
Civil Engineers issued in January of 
this year.
.“The underpaid ongineer does not 
always owe his failure to secure a sal­
ary commensurate with the import­
ance or difficulty of his work to the 
ignorance or lack of appreciation of 
laymen, but it not infrequently is the 
fault1 of his engineering superior in 
the organization of which lie is a part. 
The replies received by' the commit­
tee indicate that engineers in private., 
practice sometimes employ men of ex­
tensive experience, and presumably of 
good ability, at salaries which young 
graduates with little or 110 experience 
are able to command, but which are 
less, than those of an ordinary 
mechanic who has a labor organiza­
tion behind him.
should be the basis of all education, 
and a failure here is not compensated 
for by a smattering of many subjects. 
One of the prime faults in the Amer­
ican educational system is the crowd­
ing through of students in as many 
subjects as possible with the time at 
disposal.”
Prof. G. F. Swain of Harvard, rec­
ommends the following remedies for 
our present spstem. He first says, 
“The young man from our technical 
school should have passed through 
four years of the strictest mental, 
moral and physical discipline.” As re­
forms be suggests.
“(1.) The engineering schools 
should tr>f to secure a broader curri­
culum with more attention paid to 
fundamental principles and less atten­
tion to the technical details, which 
can be learned better in the field than 
in school.
“(2.) The use of proper English 
should be inculcated into the student 
both through the use of good text 
books and through the necessary 
courses in rhetoric.
“(3.) The minds of engineering stu­
dents should be broadened by the 
study of history, literature, logic, 
psychology, and other subjects which 
give a broad outlook upon life.”
Another eminent practicing engineer 
once said,
“No greater mistake was ever made 
tlian that which asserts that the engi­
neer does not need to be liberally edu­
cated. He who learns simply the 
practice of his day will soon be behind 
the times; he is a machine to be laid 
aside when a more profitable one is 
found. But he who has caught the 
spirit of growth is the one who makes 
precedents and determines the prac­
tice of his time. The latter only is 
able to solve old problems and new 
conditions; he only has the good judg­
ment necessary to know when to be 
exact and when not to be exact; and 
he only undestands that there is very 
much that books and formulas can 
not include.”
(To Be Continued Next Week)
“It may be urged that competition 
for engineering work is keen, bui the 
fact remains tbat employing engineers 
are sometimes disposed to pay their 
men less than their services are actu­
ally worth, a plain violation of engi­
neering .ethics.
“Perhaps there are too many en­
gineers, and your committee does not 
consider the general decrease in the 
registration at engineering schools a 
bad omen for the profession. There 
is a need for better engineers rather 
than for more engineers.”
There is at present an undercurrent 
of dissatisfaction among the profes­
sion with the system of engineering 
education employed. The engineering 
schools are operated too much on the 
principle enunciated by Mr. Grad- 
grind in Dickens’ novel “Hard Times." 
He said, “Facts alone are wanted in 
life, plant nothing else, and root out 
everything else.” The tendency of an 
engineering education is to produce a 
useful machine with no accomplish­
ments. The engineer is known as a 
silent, awkward, self-conscious individ­
ual, whose thoughts lie too deep for 
words. The utilitarianism of an en­
gineering education seems to be la­
mented on all sides. Prof. A. C. 
Humphreys, President of Steven's In­
stitute of Technology, said:

uniforms, the committee ordered them 
immediately, and it is expected that 
the various companies will appear at 
drill with uniforms and rifles in throe 
weeks.
It was the original intention of the 
school officers to form two battalions 
at Tech. Science school was to furnish 
four companies forming Battalion I, 
and Industries and Design were to fur­
nish two companies each, this form­
ing Battalion II. Ono hundred and 
thirty Design men pledged to appear 
at drill, but so far loss titan seventy 
have done so. This necessitates the 
omission of H Company of Battalion 
II. There are sufficient men in De­
sign to prevent this, and unless they 
appear in drill before Wednesday, the 
whole battalion ranks will have to be 
closed in. This will be done at Thurs­
day morning roll call. It Is Important 
therefore that Design men furnish 
their quota.
In General Orders No. 3, April 27, 
Capt. Meyers officially assumed com­
mand of the Tech Military organiza­
tion and outlined the nature of the 
drills. Battalions are Companies A, 
B, C, D and Battalion II, Companies 
E, F, G, H, will constitute the Tech 
regiment, and will report for' drill in 
Schenley park each morning at 8 
o’clock. On rainy mornings, the com­
pany will report at assembly in their 
respective schools where lectures of 
a military nature wil be given by army 
and school officers.
Last- Friday evening, the night 
Science men recruited forty students 
to organize for military drill. The 
night men will drill on the campus, 
Monday and Friday evenings, from 
7:30 to S:30. Lieut. Shinkle of the 
Reserve Corps, was elected adjutant 
and will assume charge of the drills, 
This action of the night men is con­
vincing proof that military drill is 
deemed necessary and wise by the 
majority of Tech students, either day 
or night.

CENTRAL COUNCIL
HAS FIRST MEETING
(Continued From Page One. 
the Industries School objected to that 
clause of the constitution which pro­
vides for an executive committee. 
Last Wednesday, however, the school 
ratified^ every other section but that 
one; so the Constlution is now offi­
cial but is without any provision for 
an executive committee. Also the 
council will for the present lack an 
official president, since it is too late 
to go through the rather elaborate 
system of electing a man for tills 
year, when it is already time to elect 
one for next year. Accordingly there 
was only a vice president chosen, and 
he will fill the office of president 
until the new election early in May.
The elections for that and the other 
offices resulted as follows:
Vice President ..................T. E. Orr
Secretary-treasurer ....M. E. Boyer
Recorder ....................J. R. Hoxworth
The matter of the Red Cross was 
presented to the council by Miss 
McCandlass, who is responsible for 
mucli of that work, already done in 
Margaret Morrison. She has been 
in communication with the National 
organization, and has all the neces­
sary data and application blanks 
ready. It will be necessary to organ­
ize with at least four officers before 
making application, and it was 
thought best to do this in the four 
schools, since that will give the or­
ganization more weight and it will 
enable the boys to help by contribut­
ing and soliciting. An organized 
auxiliary has the advantage that the 
supplies made will be kept here 
rather than be sent to some other 
depot. The committee appointed from 
the council to back the auxiliary is 
as follows: Miss Willis, chairman,
Williamson, Merker and Eaton.
In discussing qualification day, the 
council decided to have the Margaret 
Morrison School participate more, 
than has been done in other years; 
otherwise the affair will be as usual. 
Eaton was appointed to take charge. 
It. was decided to have a standing 
committee on plebe regulations, which 
will formulate certain general rules 
that can be adopted with some varia­
tion by "each of the four schools. That 
committee consists of Orr, chair­
man; Miss Pruyne, Hoxworth and 
Boyer.
The election of next year’s presi­
dent of the council was discussed 
and it was asked that the nomina­
tions be made by each school by May 
9. Williamson and Merker were ap­
pointed as a committe on by-laws. 
Monday at 4:20 was established as 
the regular meeting time, the next 
meeting being in two weeks.
The official roll of the council 
shows the following members: 
President M. M. C. S. Senate, Miss 
Pruyne.

Church, where valuable work was 
executed by the late John La Farge 
and Augustus St. Gaudens, and to 
many other buildings of note for 
their mural and ornamental decora­

Monnies, the renowned sculptor and 
painter, Mr. de Leftwitch Dodge and 
and Mr. Arthur Covey, painters and 
illustrators of well-known repute, 
each of whom gave us special talks 
and advice in their respective studios.
We were also very courteously re­
ceived by the following firms: 
French & Co., who have a wonderful 
collection of Tapestries and Antique 
Furniture, a suite of furniture of 
fourteen pieces formerly owned by 
the King of Belgium being shown 
that was worth $350,000; Baumgarten 
& Co., where we saw a large collec­
tion of very valuable antiques of 
every description; Altman & Co., 
where we had the pleasure of visit­
ing their studios in decoration— 
seeing some superb designs for petit- 
point tapestry, and also the crafts- 
women executing the same by hand, 
which was quite a revelation to us; 
and the inspection of the celebrated 
Tiffany Studios was also a great 
treat. We saw there the different 
methods of executing work for the 
many art activities embraced by this 
well-known firm of decorators.
We also wish to acknowledge the 
courtesy of the editors of the Maga­
zine published in the Buttericlc Build­
ing, who gave us an insight into how 
illustrating is conducted, and also at 
Scribner’s, where every attention was 
given to enlighten us as to the se­
crets of successfully illustrating; also 
at McCall's Magazine, and lastly in 
Philadelphia, at the Ladies’ Home 
Journal, where the beautiful glass 
Mosaic landscape designed by Max- 
field Parrish and executed by the 
Tiffany Studios was shown, as well 
as their collection of original draw­
ings of illustrations, and their meth­
ods of printing and sending out 
magazines to all parts.
