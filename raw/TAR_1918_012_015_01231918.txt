TASKS FOR THE UNFIT
A great deal o£ curiosity lias been 
expressed by the students as to what 
the new uniform will look like. As far 
as can be determined, it will be made 
similar to the regulation uniform with 
a few exceptions. For instance, in­
stead of the regular bronze military 
button containing the eagle, a button 
will bq substituted which has in­
scribed on it the - letters “C. I. T.” 
Major. Lyle also expressed his desire 
-of having spiral leggins, and Lieut. 
Mintner advised that military caps be 
procured instead of campaign hats, 
as they will be more serviceable. The 
uniform is to be made of khaki 
throughout and will cost about nine 
dollars at a minimum, as estimated 
by Dr. James, chairman of the com­
mittee of military affairs.
Major Lyle has announced lately 
that credit will be given for the work 
in military drill, three and one-lialf be­
ing given for a satisfactory completion 
of the course. Strict attendance is 
also required and six cuts will expel 
a man from school unless he can pro­
vide a reasonable excuse for absence. 
No one is exempt from the training 
and even the “physically unfit” will be 
given something to do, such as blow­
ing a bugle and many duties of a like 
nature which they can perform with­
out any inconvenience whatever.

PROF. M' CULLOUQH IS NEW FOOTBALL GAMES 
’HOST TO TAU BETA PI ADDED TO SCBEBULE
Tech’s Chapter of Tau Beta Pi was 
fortunate enough to be invited to hold 
one of its literary meetings at Profes­
sor McCullough’s home. The men 
certainly enjoyed the entertainment 
and the luncheon which Professor and 
Mrs. McCullough had for them, and 
are more than grateful.
The meeting itself was for the pur­
pose of hearing papers prepared in 
competition by the members initiated 
two weeks ago. The papers were 
judged by an alumni committee of the 
association, consisting of Prof. Mc­
Cullough, Prof. Hower and Mr. Sim- 
monds, and that written by E. L. Mur­
phy judged as the best. The topics 
were chosen from a list printed in The 
Bent, the quarterly magazine of Tau 
Beta Pi. Murphy, as well as Pugh 
and Konnerth, chose “A General Dis­
cussion of the Factors Necessary for 
Success in Engineering,” and among 
them pointed out that health, patience, 
a thorough foundation in the sciences, 
and a spirit of reverence are some of 
the prime requisites. Fulton and Ritts 
discussed. “An Engineer's Library,” 
with special reference to methods of 
indexing, so that information will be 
readily available. Todd and Armor 
wrote their idea is to “The Ideal Suc­
cess for an Engineer”; between this 
topic and the first, the meeting heard 
a great deal about success, but the pa­
pers really were interesting, and many 
of the ideas original.
EASFDORM NOW LATEST VICTIM OF QUARANTINE
Another quarantine is in effect at 
Tech, which marks the fourth time 
/that has happened within three 
months. East Dormitory is the unfor­
tunate one this time. A case of scar­
let fever was reported there last Sat­
urday and the dorm was consequently 
quarantined by the Board of Health 
at about 7 o’clock that evening. Many 
East Dorm men were at the big dor­
mitory smoker. Dr. Marks put them 
on their honor to go back, which they 
all did, after partaking of their share 
of the eats and after taking an ample 
supply of smokes with them. They 
had a smoker of their own then in 
their club room, which didn’t break 
up until about 11:30 that night.
These men will be in quarantine for 
eight days and their meals will be 
brought to them. Everything is being 
done to make the confinement of these 
men as pleasant as possible. There 
will be ample time for study, if noth­
ing else.
Graduate Athletic Manager Eyman 
announced the following football 
schedule last week:
Sept. 2S—Geneva at Tech Field.
Oct. 5—Westminster at Tech Field. 
Oct. 12—Lehigh at Tech Field.
Oct. 19—Bucknell at Tech Field.
Oct. 26—Cornell University at Ithaca, 
N. Y.
Nov. 2—Allegheny at Tech Field. 
Nov. 9—Open
Nov. 16—University of Pittsburgh at 
Forbes Field.
This is the stiffest schedule that has 
been offered for some seasons and 
with the loss of so many of last year’s 
varsity it will tax Coach Steffen's skill 
to the utmost to develop a machine to 
battle for the Plaid next season. 
Geneva, Lehigh and Bucknell have al­
ways maintained good gridiron teams 
in the past and are to be new oppo­
nents for Tech this year.
WEST1NGH0USE MEN 
INSTRUCTORS AT NIGHT
The departure of Mr. Van Dyck and 
later Mr. Howard and Mr. Porter for 
service with the Government left the 
Electrical Engineering Department 
with quite a load-on its shoulders, ne­
cessitating the complete attention of 
Profs. Wurtz, Work and Dennison to 
the day classes only. Fortunately 
for the night men, the E. E. depart­
ment was able to borrow three of the 
Westinghouse Electric engineers, 
Messrs. Lafoon, Smith and Witham, 
for the remainder of the term. As 
many of the night men are Westing- 
house men, this common bond is of 
special interest and value, as they are 
learning at first hand of the manufac­
turing practice and methods of other 
departments.

M. M. C. S.IREPRESENTED 
IN PATRIOTIC LEAGUE
The Girls’ Patriotic League of Amer­
ica is represented in M. M. C. S. by 
the S. O. S. Club. With a few excep­
tions, every girl in the school has 
joined and they are going to work to­
gether for the good of our soldiers, 
by sacrificing some definite pleasure 
and by doing better, the work they 
have already begun. Some girls are 
giving their sacrificed money to their 
unpaid Y. M. C. A. pledges, some to 
the work of the Y. W. C. A., some to 
the Red Cross, etc.
A large number of Margaret Mor­
rison girls were present at the meet­
ing in Syria Mosque on Sunday to hear 
Miss Margaret Slattery's address. This 
meeting was probably the biggest 
meeting for^just girls ever held in the 
history of Pittsburgh. The auditorium 
was crowded, and it was a very thrill 
ing moment when all joined hands and 
pledged unified efforts for the Ameri­
can flag. The keynote of Miss Slat­
tery’s . talk was that the American 
women should learn true democracy 
by co-operating in their efforts to do 
service for their country.
EVERYONE IN SCHOOL 
MUST BE VACCINATED
The Drama Department of Design is 
having a rather strenuous task to keep 
up with their schedule at present, ow­
ing to the fact that two plays are be­
ing produced here at Tech this week, 
aside from the taking of the Pageant, 
“The Drawing of the Sword,” to Camp 
Sherman, at Cliilicotlie, Ohio. The 
plays given in the Little Theater this 
week are Moliere’s “A Doctor in Spite 
of Himself,” Monday night, and Swin- 
burne.’s “Atalanta in Calydon,” on 
Wednesday, January 23. The former 
was given here last year, but has been 
revived for the purpose of showing it 
at Camp Sherman. The cast is as fol­
lows :

NIGHT SCIENCE SOCIAL 
COMES IN FEDRUARY
Dsncing and Other Entertain­
ment to be Provided at 
Schenley
On Saturday evening, February 16, 
at the Schenley Hotel will be held the 
First Annual Night Science Social un­
der the auspices of the second year 
class. This affair is a direct outcome 
of the Klanicht’s request that each 
Nite Science class give an affair L’or 
all the classes in order to promote 
the social spirit of Night Science. Be­
cause of the lack of time among the 
Night men, especially during school 
hours, they have little lime to mix. 
To do away with this condition, dif­
ferent affairs will be held during the 
year to enable the men to get togeth­
er. Inasmuch as all previous affairs 
have been stags, added interest is cen­
tered in this affair and a large turn­
out is expected.
The Social will be informal and the 
program will consist of a dance and 
general entertainment, which • feature 
is being worked out to provide amuse­
ment for the men who will not be 
dancing. An elaborate program is be­
ing arranged and this double enter­
tainment will insure everyone an en­
joyable evening. The committee of 
the second year class arranged most 
of the details during the Christmas 
vacation period in order to provide 
plenty of time for publicity; the final 
details will be complete within a few 
days. All classes are . urged to see 
their class officers about tickots as 
soon as possible in order to facilitate 
final arrangements. Every night man 
should try to be present and help 
make this affair a success.
PROGRAM OF CONCERTS’’ 
SCHEDULED FOR CLUBS
Last Sunday the Musical Clubs as­
sembled in the Breckon Studios and 
had another picture taken. The pic­
ture in December was not as good as 
expected, so that it was thought ad­
visable to have another taken. Sev­
eral men were unfortunate in being 
quarantined in the East Dormitory, 
and could not be in the picture.
The program of concerts for this 
season is fast being rounded into 
shape. Second Assistant Manager 
Treat returned from a trip on Sun­
day, and states that he had signed 
up two concerts with prospects of 
another being signed up shortly. These 
three concerts will constitute the trip 
to be taken between semesters on 
the dates February 6, 7, and 8.
The clubs have a concert scheduled 
for every Friday evening in March 
and part of April. The annual Home 
concert and dance, the biggest social 
event of the school year, excluding the 
Junior Prom, will be held Friday even­
ing, March 15.
Now that the clubs have something 
definite to work for, the two direc­
tors are working the men to the ut­
most. Several extra rehearsals will 
be held within the period before the 
trip is taken and the specialty num­
bers are under way already.
FOUR-QUARTER YEAR AUTHORIZES; CENTRAL SCHOOL TO BE FORMED
Director Hamerschlag has issued in­
structions that all members of the in­
stitute, including faculty, students, ! 
and employes, should be vaccinated, j 
excepting those who can show a cer- j 
tificate from their physician that they 
have been successfully vaccinated 
within four years.
In view of a prevalence of smallpox 
in Pittsburgh at the present time, this 
precautionary measure is taken now to 
avoid the possibility of the institution 
being compelled to suspend classes at 
a later date.
The services of the resident physi­
cians of the Institute’s Department of 
Student Health are available (without 
exjjense) to.members of the Institute. 
The resident physicians, Dr. Margaret 
A. Gould and Dr. Win. L. Marks, are 
in charge. Dr. Gould’s olilce hours are 
12:!30 nLo 1:30, on Tuesdays; 4:00 to 
5:00, on Wednesdays, and 12:30 to 
l:o0, on Fridays, in M. M. C. S. Dr. 
Marks’ office hours are 8:30 to 12:00,

PITT ADDS ANOTHER 
VICTORY TO HER LIST
Kofed Stars for Tech With 
Five Field Goals
Last Friday evening before an en­
thusiastic representation of Techitos, 
Pitt defeated '‘Tech for the eleventh 
consecutive time. Tech’s lone vic­
tory came in 1911, when Pitt was
downed by the score of 20-30. 
All indications pointed to a
close match at Trees’s Gym this 
year, and so it was, till Tech’s defense 
broke down in the last ten minutes.
A new line-up for each team set
them both at a disadvantage. Pearl- 
man of Pitt had been disqualified dur­
ing the week by Director Miller for 
playing on an outside team; so Nico­
las started at center. The rest of the 
Pitt, lineup remained intact; Penman 
and Levine at forward and McLaren 
and lflasterday at guard. Because 
L&Vlnson, who is awaiting his call for 
aviation, has dropped out of school, 
Coach McCulloch placed Kofeod at 
guard with Williams. I-Ioban was 
given a chance in “Doc” Doherty’s 
berth, with “Lofty” Abrams. “Gretz” 
is still on the job at con tor.
A minute or so after the start, a 
foul and a field goal for each team 
brought the score to 3-3. “Lefty” then 
made three more foiils count and after 
Penman had succeeded in dropping 
one in too, Tech followed up with a 
field goal, gaining an 8-4 load. Luck 
turned soon, however, and Pitt, be­
fore long, tied at 12-12. A double foul 
by Easterday gave “Lofty” an oppor­
tunity to neatly drop in two more foul 
shots, thus bringing our tally up to 14, 
where it stayed till the end of the first 
half. Throe fouls and three field goals

SOLDIERS ENJOY SMOKER 
GIVEN BY DORM MEN
Saturday night, January 20, in the 
Union, the big dorm smoker took 
place. In spite of the extreme cold, a 
large crowd of dormites were present 
to enjoy the program provided by 
Harry Gelliu. Smokes and eats were 
in abundance, as were smokers and 
eaters.
The men from the East Dorm were 
not permitted to stay, due to the quar­
antine of the East Dorm. They were' 
served, however, in the beannery, from 
where they carried their program to 
the East Dortl club room.
In the Union every one enjoyed a 
novel entertainment. The band played 
the Star-Spangled Banner and also the 
British National Anthem. The soldiers’ 
“quartet” rendered several snappy 
pieces. Movies, too, were on the pro­
gram. Scenes of Tech and a comic 
reel were shown.
Stone, of the Dorms, pulled some 
clever sleiglit-oMiand stunts, followed 
by Throckmorton with a ventriloquist 
act. He was assisted by a real dummy 
in place of our friend Shakespeare.
Henderson gave a talk on the Dar­
danelles campaign, followed by talks 
by Mr. Faust and Dean Mott. Stotz 
gave a clever monologue. Lieut. Smith 
and Sergt. McKay gave interesting 
talks, followed by the oats. Doughnuts 
and ice cream was served, lflveryone 
present heartily agreed that Obert and 
Gellin are responsible for a great time, 
and that the whole affair was carried 
off in fine stylo.
These Changes Decided Upon 
by Council to Increase 
Efficiency
EFFECTIVE IN JULY
By action of the Administrative 
Council, January 21, the Institute will 
conduct, its work on four quarter year 
basis, effective July 1. The question 
of the necessary readjustments in the 
curriculum and credits is being re­
ferred to the four faculties for inde­
pendent. action.
The creation of a Central School, 
with a faculty of General Studies, had 
been decided upon as a means of se 
curing greater administrative and e t 
ucational efficiency for the entire In 
stitution. It is probable that the fol 
lowing departments will be included! 
in the new faculty: Ma H
modern languages, English g 
economics, psychology, peda;|||||fn 
itary science and tactics, phyCjjj^ 
i cation and health. To it. will- ^

VOL.XI
W. & J. OPPOSES TECH 
IN GAMEJN SATURDAY
One of the hardest basket ball 
games of the season is to be staged 
next Saturday evening in the Tech 
Field House. The varsity will play 
W. & J., which was defeated by 
Geneva College last Friday, for the 
first time since 1894. This does not 
show that W. & J.’s chances against 
Tech are not very good this vear, how­
ever, especially considering the fact 
that West Virginia was beaten by Pitt
30-20, whereas W. & J. licked West 
Virginia to the tune of 33-9.
Byerly, the best player of the five, 
is putting in his third year at center. 
Post and Carroll are forwards. Car­
roll was left-end on_W. & J.'s football 
team this year and starred in the 
Geneva game. Tressel and Henry, 
who are holding the guard positions 
aré both football men. Henry is all- 
American tackle, while Tressel played 
right-end center this year.
Tech will most likely start off with 
Gretzler at center, Abrams and Doher­
ty or Hoban at forward, and Williams 
and Kofeod at guard. A preliminary 
game will be played by the Plebes 
against Vandergrift High starting 
promptly at 7:30. A hard battle is 
expected and all should be present to 
offer their best support.

MUSIC STUDENTS PLAY 
WELL ATHIRST CONCERT
The Department of Music (J. Vick 
O’Brien, director) gave Its Initial con­
cert of the season Sunday evening, 
January 20, In the theater of the 
School ol! Applied Design, before a 
large and appreciative audience.
The opening number, "Variations,” 
(Death and the Malden), from String 
Quartette In D minor, Fr. Schubert, 
was played with much delicacy and 
artistic feeling. The members of the 
quartet wore, Horaco 1. Brown, Dor- 
othoy Mannor, Roland Bellingham 
and Jean Wossner.
The group of piano numbers, Noc­
turne 10, Chopin, Etude in I'1 sharp, 
Arensky and Dobussy’s Arabusquo No.
I, wore most acceptably played by Miss 
Frances Levonson and gave the per­
former an opportunity to interpret 
contrasting moods. Her work was 
marked by clean technique and polso.
Miss Helen Wight made her debut 
at the organ, playing Gullmant's do- 
lightful little “Caprice,” which was 
well received.
Mr. Murtón Rosenthal played two 
Llstz numbers for piano, “Etude, D 
flat,” "Etude, F. minor.” He displayod 
an extraordinary technique, verging 
on the blzzare; however he got results 
and may evolve a style peculiar to him­
self in the future. The applause at­
tested public approval.
The “piece de resistance” (pro- 
plaimed by repeated recalls) was Max 
Bruch’s “Scotch Fantasie,” for Violin 
played by Mr. Horace I. Brown. The 
difficulties of this composition could 
hardly be appreciated by the audience 
because of the ease with which Mr. 
Brown surmounted them. The artistry 
•of the performance was unquestion­
able. It is always a delight to find 
Mi'T Brown's name on a program. His 
work is never erratic.
The closing number, “Hosanna,” by 
Paul Wachs, for organ, was given an 
interesting interpretation by Mr. 
Charles Gilson and called forth hearty 
applause. The program had enough 
variety to sustain interest and was a 
demonstration of the old saw, that 
“brevity is the soul of wit”—as every­
one went away wishing it had been 
longer and looking forward to the next 
program, which will be presented on 
Sunday evening, February 3.

RAPID PROGRESS BEING 
MADE IN RADIO COURSE
The course in Radio, established in 
the Industries School early in Decem­
ber, at the request of the U. S. Gov­
ernment, is progressing very rapidly, 
under the direction of Profs. Calden- 
wood, Dodds and Mr. Mayo. At pres­
ent there are three hundred and twen­
ty-live men enrolled in the course and 
that fact alone requires twelve special 
instructors for the department.
The course is primarily intended to 
prepare men for the Signal Corps; 
however, men enlisted in the Aviation 
Section are eligible, and by taking up 
this course before attending ground 
school much time is gained; as a re­
sult about seventy men enlisted in the 
Aviation Section are availing them 
selves of this opportunity.
The Continental Morse, or Interna­
tional Code is used. The equipment 
is the latest, of the most approved de­
sign. The beginners are taught to re­
ceive in groups by listening to the 
sound of the high frequency buzzer 
mounted on a special resonator. This 
device was originated by the instruc­
tors in charge of the course.
Three methods of instruction are 
employed in the beginners classes; the 
visual, the phonetic, and the synthetic 
methods. The first is the usual meth­
od and consists of learning the code 
from the card. In the second the stu­
dent receives his impressions entire­
ly by ear, single letters being sent un­
til the student masters the code. In 
the third method, the very first lesson 
is presented by sending complete 
words or groups of letters. The latter 
method was originated in this school 
and is proving very successful.
When a certain degree of proficiency 
is reached the student is taught the 
use of the key and is then placed at 
specially built tables, where a sep­
arate key and head receiver is pro­
vided. The tables are so wired that an 
instructor may send to all or to groups 
as he may choose, or two or more stu­
dents may be connected and send back 
and forth.
Students are promoted when they 
reach a speed of six words per minute, 
then at ten words, and fifteen words. 
When twenty words per minute in 
sending and receiving is reached, a 
certificate is given which is to be pre­
sented to the commanding officer of 
the cantonment to Avhich the draftee 
may be sent.
This will insure the favorable at­
tention of the commanding signal 
officer.
The Department of Psychology also 
assists in the conduct of the course, 
as they apply the preliminary mental 
tests; they also apply the latest meth­
ods in the classification and promotion 
of the students.
The actual instruction in sending 
and receiving is given by special in­
structors and skiled operators. More 
instructors and two new classes will 
be started this week, and a day class 
will begin work in a few days. In ad­
dition to telegraph practice, lectures 
and demonstrations covering elemen­
tary electricity and application to 
telegraphy will form part of the 
oourse.
TRACK WORK PROGRESSES 
UNDER DIFFICULTIES
Athletic prospects assumod a more 
definite aspect during the past week, 
but this Important branch of activ­
ity 1ms not completely emerged from 
the chaotic condition In which the war 
involved- It. Following the advice of 
Secretary of War Baker, Graduate 
Athletic Manager Eyman and the 
various managers are doing their ut­
most to schedule games and develop 
teams for the various sports. The ad­
vent of military training has de­
creased the time available for training 
the various athletic squads.
Coach Eyman and Captain Ellerton, 
of the track team, want all men inter­
ested in track to respond this week for 
the preliminary work-outs. They are 
especially anxious to meet any new 
men who have or think they might de­
velop some ability along these lines. 
The standard of athletic attainments 
for the season are lower than previous­
ly and it therefore offers an excellent 
opportunity for men to derive the 
benefits of athletic training. Men who 
desire to try out as assistant track 
managers are also requested to. re­
port. Remember the larger the squad 
the better opportunity we will have of 
turning out a strong team in the 
spring.
Origin of Dover's Powder.
"Dover’s powder,” an old-fashioned 
remedy still to be found at most drug­
gists’, is named after Captain Dover, a 
worthy of the seventeenth century. 
Captain Dover’s other claim to fame 
is that he rescued Alexander Selkirk, 
the castaway of the island of Juan 
Fernandez, and thus was instrumental 
in giving "Robinson Crusoe” to the 
world. Captain Dover practiced medi­
cine in an independent way—chiefly 
on his own men—and in this way came 
to concoct the powder which hoars Ills 
name.
IS HONORED BY SCIENTISTS
Electricity on Submarines.
All submarines are operated by elec­
tricity, as obviously they could not be 
operated by steam, when submerged. 
In addition to its use for propulsion, 
electricity Is utilized on submarines 
for lighting, for fans, for wireless com­
munications and to cook all meals for 
the crew.
Theodore William Richards, presi­
dent of the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science, was born 
in Germantown, Pa., on January 31, 
1868, and is the son of William T. Rich­
ards, a famous American painter of 
marine and landscapes, and Anna Mat- 
lack Richards, well known for her po­
etical writings.
Scientific societies at home and 
abroad have honored him with elec­
tions. In the United States he is a 
member of the American Academy of 
Arts and Sciences (1891), the Ameri­
can Philosophical society (1903) and 
since 1899 of the National Academy of 
Sciences. In 1914 he served the Amer­
ican Chemical society as its president, 
also he is an honorary member of the 
Chemists club of New York city. 
Among his honors abroad are foreign 
membership in the London Chemical 
society (1908) and honorary or corre­
sponding membership in the Royal In­
stitute of Great Britain (1906), the Royal Academy of Sweden (1907), and the 
Royal Berlin Academy of Sciences (1909). His membership in the American 
association is of comparatively recent date; for he joined it only at its Boston 
meeting in 1898, and a year later was made a fellow. At the New York meet­
ing last year his eminence in the domain of chemistry easily made him a 
worthy candidate for recognition and the association gladly conferred on him 
the greatest honor in its gift.—From the Scientific American.
STUDENT NOW IN NAVY 
WRITES OF HIS WORK
The following extracts from a letter 
written by a former Science, student, 
now in a Naval Training School, illus­
trate rather well the life which he is 
now enjoying:
"Since joining the Navy I have 
been spending 24 hours a day in the 
detention camp here at the station. 
It sounds bad—as though I had done 
something, but the Navy Department 
just took that for granted, after giv­
ing me the once over, and as a result 
I have been having everything inside 
and out examined, removed, or re­
placed. It is the good luck of every­
one joining the Navy to be ‘detented’ 
for three weeks, so that the real Navy 
life will be appreciated.
"The great bugaboo here is the ty­
phus inoculation—there are. three 
shots, and at the first performance, 
when everybody is nicely lined up and 
stripped, and the doctors begin the 
‘shooting,’ the poor dubs begin to drop 
as if they were being raked with ma­
chine gun fire. On the occasion of our 
first shot, one poor raw’-boned gook, 
about 6 feet 2 inches, and 180 pounds, 
did a spiral glide to the ‘deck,’ and 
then they started dropping right along 
the line. I thought, ‘That must be 
some shot to knock ’em out like that,’ 
but it wasn’t bad when I got it. In 
fact, the operation was over before I 
felt it. We had our last one today 
and, glory be, we leave here in a day 
or two and then begin to enjoy life 
again. A six-foot fence and 50 guards 
have kept us in this camp of 3,000 ‘de­
tented’ men, but we get liberty every 
day soon. There are nearly 30,000 
‘jackies’ in training here and it is just
like an army cantonment and a city. 
Barracks are electric lighted and 
steam heated and we have all the con­
veniences of home—(somewhat \con- 
densed. Chow is fine, real dairy but­
ter, sugar and cream in coffee, and all 
we need. There is a great bunch here.
“We had fire drill the other night. 
In the wee small hours a guard 
knocked us out of our warm ham­
mocks and yelled ‘Fire!—Form out­
side—Don't stop to dress!” Well, we 
did, but we didn’t go without dressing. 
It was 21 degrees below and a 60-mile 
gale was blowing off the lake—a bliz­
zard so bad a street light could not be 
seen 50 feet. Wow! Talk about cold! 
That bridge across the hollow is hot 
in winter beside that storm.”
SOLDIERS STUDYING 
AUTO MAINTENANCE
The soldiers at Tech are pursuing 
courses whose hours are much more 
exacting than those of the regular 
students. The group which is studying 
Automobile Operation and Mainten­
ance in the Industries School has 
eight full hours a day, six days a week. 
For the first five days the schedule is 
as follows: For half the men, Auto­
mobile Repairing from 8:30 to 11:30, 
for the other half, Elementary Elec­
tricity and Ignition Systems; for both 
groups a lecture either by Mr. Hep­
burn or Mr. Ambrose from 11:30 to 
12:30; mess from 12:30 to 1:30; Au­
tomobile Motor Laboratory from 1:30 
to 5:30. On Saturdays the schedule 
is the same except in the morning, 
when both squads have drawing for 
four hours.
SAVE WHEAT FOR OUR SOLDIERS—THEY 
MUST NOT SUFFER! USE CORN FLOUR
Two Wlieatless Days Each Week and One Wheatless 
Meal a Day Will Give Us 90,000,000 Bushels 
hor Our Own Boys and the Allies.
"All of our surplus wheat from the 
1917 crop has already gone to the al­
lies—or to the bottom of the sea. And 
there wasn’t enough to feed them if it 
had all reached its destination. There 
is dire distress among our fr.ends 
across the sea. Italy is today in a 
state of semi-starv'Hon and France 
and England are undergoing the 
severest privations. I aly’s defeat 
was largely due to lack of food and 
not to lack of skill in warfare or fight­
ing spirit among its pecp’.e. T e Rus­
sian collapse was chiefly the result of 
desperate hunger. To fail to supply 
the needed bread to England, France 
and Italy would be to invite more dis­
aster, and possibly complete defeat 
and ruin.”
Thus spoke Howard Heinz, Federal 
Food Administrator for Pennsylvania, 
in 'an appeal for ’ increased con­
servation of food by the American 
people with particular reference to 
wheat.
“We need -to save many things by 
self-denial and substitution,” said Mr. 
Heinz, "meat, fats and sugar, but the 
all-important thing for the next fewT 
months is wheat and more wheat.
"Our own boys are ‘over there’ 
now,” continued Mr. Heinz, "our own 
sons and brothers—to the number of 
some hundreds of thousands, and 
more are going every week. A col­
lapse or even a serious defeat en the 
allied front, through failure to sustain 
the man-power on the fighting line 
and behind it with sufficient food, 
would involve our own men in the 
general loss, as well as tho«e who 
have fought our battles for us for so 
long.
"Such a misfortune must n ver be 
allowed to befall us through the sel­
fish indulgence of those of us who are 
safely comfortable here at home We 
can save enough to meet the crisis. 
We must do it and we will.
"American patriotism is strong 
enough to measure up to all the de^
mands that may be made upon -us, 
much more to a demand that involves 
so little sacrifice as introducing two 
wheatless days per week and one 
wheatless meal per day. Many of us 
will volunteer even more. It is only 
a question of bringing home clearly to 
every individual mind a realization of 
the fact that it is the individual sav­
ing that will save the situation and 
that only the individual sav'ng can 
save it. What one person or one fam­
ily can save amounts to a little in 
itself, to be sure, but the aggregate 
amount of the little daily savings of a 
hundred million patriotic people is 
vast enough to meet our need.
“The American people as individu­
als must wake up to the situation as 
they have not waked up yet. The so­
lution of this food crisis is not up to 
the nation or the state or to any of­
ficials. It is not to be solved by the 
few or by your neighbors. It is a 
question for you, American Fathers, 
.Mothers, brothers, sisters, friends, o1 
the brave American boys who have 
gone forth to make the supreme sacri­
fice that you may continue to live in 
peace under free American institu 
tions—to you, every one individu 
ally.
“This means to the housewife, the 
cutting out on wheatiless days and at 
wheatless meals of white b^ead, rolls 
and pastry, including pies, also such 
foods as macaroni and spaghetti on 
the home table—the regular purchase 
of at least one-tliird and better, one 
half as much wheats flour as before 
from her grocer to this extent. It 
means using in place of, er in combi­
nation with, wheat flour, more corn 
meal and corn and barley flour, more 
rye, buckwheat and rice, more oat- 
meal and other cereal substitutes fo» 
wheat in the every day menu.
"May the response of Pennsylvania 
in this hour of grave danger £o ou" 
cause be immediate and generously 
worthy of our great State.”

can be served raw or cooked to please 
the most capricious palate. Like the 
onion, it provides the highly necessary 
mineral salts. And, like meat and

The jaboricello, or soap berry tree,

and has wide-spreading branches and 
immense quantities of fruit of the size

transparent yellowish skin and pulp

so saponaceous as to be used instead

Pain Gives Warning.
The nervous system is our life-sav­
ing service and every time a nerve 
aches or quivers In pain it is a bless­
ing in disguise. The first bit of tooth­
ache warns you that disease germs are 
attacking Its structure. An ache in the 
head is notice that something is wrong 
somewhere and not always is it in the 
head Itself. Pain is not nature’s meth­
od of punishment, it is her way of 
warning. When you feel pain don’t 
merely try to allay it, seek out its real 
cause and stop that.
Shopping Made Easy,
No longer must the married man

silks over the counters of the depart­

by standardization. Soon Henry will 
be able to order E-6785 and carry It 
home to Jane with the absolute cer­
tainty that there will be no come-back. 
The magic mechanism is the colorime­

MEMORIAL SERVICES 
HELD FOR PROF. ZELLER
A very touching and appropriate 
memorial service was held in the Lit­
tle Theater of the School of Applied 
Design on Tuesday* afternoon of last 
week for Professor August Zeller, of 
the Department of Sculpture. Profes­
sor Zeller was one of the oldest mem-
bers of the faculty, and universally 
well known and liked. His death came 
unexpectedly, and was a blow to the 
whole school, which united in mourn­
ing for him. A sculptured memorial 
stands in the Design foyer in his 
honor. The chief members of the 
faculty and administrative body of the 
school spoke at the services, and the 
following poem, written to him by 
Professor Long, was read:
TO A DEAD SCULPTOR 
Now this man so loved the cities 
of the sons of men
and all the detail and design of them— 
and all the fine brave ways of living 
and giving 
of the sons of mon— 
and their merriment and the good 
stories they tell— 
and he knew so much about beauty, too 
and the form and miraculous face of it 
and how to make it come warm 
from a piece of clay or a block of 
marble . . .
And when a man dies 
who has made beauty all his life 
he will go 011 making beauty— 
and naught can prevent him— 
and he will make beauty of a stranger 
kind
and a more intimate meaning . . .
So now when we say good-bye . 
to him for ever 
we know he will be safe— 
for if he loved the cities of earth 
he will love 110 less 
the incomparable City of Dreams 
he has gone away to inhabit— 
and the voices and the mirth of it 
and the stars and the size of it 
;\nd the details and disguise of it 
and the sudden sweet surprise of it— 
of that beautiful far-away City 
in the country of Dreams.

Government Lessons Reach 
Millions of the Boys and 
Girls in United States
“Machine Industry and community 
life are the special themes In the series 
of lessons on the war, recently issued 
by the United States bureau of educa­
tion, department of the Interior, and 
now being studied by a million or more 
school boys and girls of all grades 
throughout the nation.
- The bureau’s series of lessons on 
“Community and National Life,” as 
they were termed by President Wilson, 
in his original announcement to the 
schools, have now reached their third 
issue. Recent issues dealt with the 
organization of modern industrial life 
as compared with pioneer days, the ef­
fect of war on commerce in nitrate, 
the war and airplanes, production and 
wise consumption, and similar topics. 
The idea of teaching the principles of 
conservation underlying successful 
prosecution of the war originated with 
the food administration, but the plan 
has now been taken over by the bureau 
of education. Prof. Charles H. Judd 
of the University of Chicago, with the 
assistance of a corps of writers in the 
various fields, is preparing these gov­
ernment texts for the-pupils In the ele­
mentary and high schools.
Parents as well as pupils will be in­
terested in the lessons. The older high- 
scliool students will learn of the rise 
of the machine industry, from the day 
of the hand loom and the spinning 
jenny through the chances wrought 
by the Industrial -revolution, to the 
large-scale productions, world mar­
kets, and social problems of modern In­
dustry. The various elements of- cost 
In factory operating, education as en­
couraged by Industry, the contribution 
of the press, are also treated In the 
lesson for older pupils.

est sound.—Shakespeare.
When Fortune flatters, she does it 
to betray.—Syrus.
Syracuse: Preparations are being
made for the big Senior War Time 
Ball on Monday, January 21. Tickets 
are 011 sale at half price of last. year. 
Whether students will walk to the ball 
or not is a much discussed question 
about ‘the Hill. Chancellor Day has 
requested that, unless the weather is 
inclement, everybody walk to the ball. 
It was reported that the Hill women 
were going to hold a meeting to de­
cide one way or the other whether 
they would walk, but as yet they have 
done nothing about the matter. At 
any rate there are a great many stu­
dents who are planning to walk to the 
Gymnasium that- evening. Spectators 
will be admitted to the running track 
balcony for a small charge. There is 
a special inducement to spectators to 
attend the ball this year because of 
the fact that is will be one of the most 
unusual ever held. There will be 
many army and navy officers and en­
listed men, former students of the Uni­
versity, who will attend in uniform, 
110 other dress being allowed them.

NEW COURSES TO BE 
INSTALLED ATM.M.C.S.
On February G, a new night course 
will be started at M. M. C. S. The 
course will consist of a non-technlcal 
discussion of—
1. Functions and nutritive value of 
food.
2. Requirements of the individual 
from childhood to old age under, the 
varying conditions of activity.
3. Mow to plan meals that are both 
properly balanced and attractive.
How to make the money allow­
ance accomplish what it should.
This work is especially interesting 
to women conlrolling their own house­
holds, to child-welfare workers and to 
institutional workers. Tuition is free, 
but the charge for materials, is $2,00, 
payable the evening of registration. 
The course will continue for a period 
of twelve weeks and will be in charge 
of Miss Pope.
A course in occupational work will 
be begun in anticipation of a demand 
that will arise when disabled Ameri­
can soldiers begin to return from 
Europe. Women instructors will be 
needed in the arts and crafts, as ex­
perience lias already demonstrated 
that hand work in the hospitals Is an 
important factor in the recovery of 
patients, diverting, as it does, the 
I mind of the soldier from the horrors 
of the paBt and Ills present condition, 
as well as affording him the opportun­
ity to secure employment upon his re­
covery. In this course classes will be 
held once a week, Wednesday after­
noon, in weaving basketry, rope knit­
ting, wooden toys and rush bottoming 
chairs.
These new classes are the outgrowth 
of a preliminary class of fifty women 
which is now being given these sub­
jects during the first term under the 
instruction of Prof. Bessie Merrill.

Tech’s Plebes suffered an undeserv­
ed defeat in the preliminary game 
played at Tree's Gym last Friday. 
Bieber starred In the field but did not 
show up well on the foul line. After 
the game Captain Abrams and A1 
Slack measured up the field and found 
the foul line to be about one foot too 
far away from the basket. This may 
account for the Plebe’s poor foul 
shooting. * The contest was fast 
throughout and showed that Tech had 
a better team than. Pitt although the 
score did not.
Kelley played excellently for the 
Pitt Freshies at forward. The good 
work done by Breman and Mervis at 
guard deserves mention. An undesir­
able feature of the Panther yearljng’s 
playing, however, was their continual 
fouling, twenty-one fouls were called 
on them, four of which were single 
and one a double personal foul.
The lineup was as follows:
Pitt Freshmen. Tech Plebes.

PITTiADDS ANOTHER
VICTORY TO HER LIST
(Continued From Page One.)
boosted Pitt to the 21 mark.
Determined not to concede an inch 
the Tech five fought continuously dur­
ing the second half. “Vet” Williams 
failed to show his usual good passing, 
rRe about the middle of the period, he 
was replaced by Wire. Iioban suffered 
a pretty bad fail , early in the period 
but he stuck in the game till Coacli 
McCullough thought is advisable to 
substitute Doherty for him. Four sub 
stitutions were made by Pitt in the 
second period, so that the only Pitt 
man who really played the entire game 
was McLaren, who did excellent work 
at guard, holding "Lefty” to a single 
field goal.
Tech’s real find in the game was 
Ivofoed, who was Ginn's understudy at 
fullback this season. His total of five 
field goals aided materially in boost­
ing the score, as did also “Lefty” 
Abram’s excellent work on the foul 
line. Penman suceeded in scoring six 
field goals and twelve out of sixteen 
fouls. Levine deserves much credit

The production of “Atalanta in Caly- 
don” is an important one and will no 
doubt be repeated. The play, one of 
the most notable achievements in the 
poetry of the nineteenth century, is in 
the form of a Greek tragedy. For per­
formance, it is divided into two acts. 
The performance will begin promptly 
at 8:30, and after that hour no one 
can be admitted to the theater, as the 
effects of the play are such as ^yould 
he seriously interfered with by the 
seating of late comers.
The famous lyrics of the chorus are 
very familiar, especialy the first: 
“When the hounds of spring are on 
winter’s traces,” 
but the play, as a whole, is not so well 
known.
It deals with the strife over the 
spoils of the great Caledonian hunt, 
the love of Meleager for the Arcadian 
huntress, Atalanta, and the vengeance 
of the queen in burning the brand with 
which the Fates have bound up Me­
leager’s life. So far as is known, this 
is the first performance of the play to 
be given in America. The cast is:
Meleager............. Hubbard Kirkpatrick
Toxeus ...................... Theodore Viehman
Plexippus ............Alexander Buchanan
King......................................James Church
Chief Hunstman ...Bishop Dickenson
Herald........................
First Messenger .. 
Second Messenger
Atalanta...................
