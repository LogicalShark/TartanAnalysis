Last Thursday evening, thirty-five 
members of the Tech Mechanics Club 
assembled at The Laurel for their 
first “get-together” dinner of the pres­
ent semester. A most pleasing meal 
was served, after which President C. 
K. Koontz introduced Mr. F. J. Hart­
man as the toastmaster of the even­
ing. After a talk by Mr. Hartman, 
short talks were made by Hoxwortli, 
president of the Senior Class of the 
Industries School; J. L. Carroll, vice 
president of the Tech Mechanics Club; 
F. J. O’Brien, chairman of the Student 
Senate, together with Hoye, W. K. 
Williams, Stamy, Gandelot and 
Koontz. Professor Leeds also gave 
an interesting talk. A feature of th£ 
evening was the first appearance of 
the “Harmony Trio," made up of 
"Cupid” Young, Chas. Yost and “Ken­
ny” Williams, who rendered several 
selections. The affair came to a close 
by the singing of “America.”

Following the lead of the Trustees, and acting upon the resolutions 
adopted by the student assembly in the Music Hall last Wednesday, which 
requested the faculty to institute military training at Tech, the Administra­
tive council voted on Monday, March 26, “that on tho authorization of the 
Board of Trustees the Administrative council go on record as ready to en­
courage any form of voluntary organization designed for service to tho 
Government and that on the formation of such organization tho matter of 
the necessary arrangements Involved would be considered by the adminis­
tration and faculty.” In this same connection it was votod “that tho Ad­
ministrative council go on record as in favor of universal sorvice of some 
kind to aid the United States Government in the present emorgoncy. Such 
service to be not only of a military nature, but also to include industrial, 
scientific and sanitary activities, nursing and Red Cross Work for women, 
or any other form of service which seems desirable.”
The above action assures the students that the deslrod co-operation oL’ 
the Faculty will be forthcoming as soon as a permanont organization with 
a definite program in view, is formed.
The following committee was elected to assist voluntary organizations 
of students in the definite formulation of aiiy plans that they may proposo 
tor service to the Government.

T. E. Orr Presides Over Meet­
ing at Which Prominent 
Men Speak.—Resolution 
Adopted Unanimously
At the general assembly of the four 
schools held last Wednesday under 
the auspices of the Committee on Mili­
tary Affairs, the student body unani­
mously voted in favor of the system 
of military training recommended by 
the United States Government. Un­
der this system the students who 
«lected military training will be mem­
bers of the Reserve Officers Training 
Corps, but will be under no obliga­
tions to enlist. For two years they 
will have two hours per week of actual 
training in place of gym work, and 
two hours lecture. For the remaining 
two years they may specialize in 
some one branch of the service. Upon 
graduation the men who have taken 
this courso may try an examination 
which will admit them to the Reserve 
Officers Corps; then they are subject 
to call in case of need. This system 
will be installed under a regular army 
officers next year. BoL’ore then tem­
porary work may be begun under 
those members of tho faculties who 
have had military training,
Wednesdays meeting was presided 
over by T. E. Orr. Tho first speaker 
was Major Mehard, president of the 
Pittsburgh Military Training Associa­
tion, who explained tho need for tho 
adoption of some such systom. J. R. 
Flannery of the Chamber of Com­
merce, told of his experience in Bel­
gium, and mentioned tho work of tho 
Rod Cross In Pittsburgh. Profossor 
Ivollar explained his own work as 
school adjutant in connection with tho 
Intorcollogiato Intelligence Bureau. 
Finally Colonol S. II. Church complot- 
od tho list of speakers with a ringing 
talk on tho prosont international sit­
uation which threatens to involvo tho

Sovoral mombors of tho student 
body then addrossod tho mooting and

THE PREPAREDESS MOVEMENT
The letter from the Trustees to President Wilson, offering the 
services of the Institute to the Nation in its hour of need, places at 
the disposal of the Government all the material, equipment, labora­
tories, shops, etc., as well as the services of the operating staff.
The services of the students, however, are not specifically in­
cluded in the offer. The duties that we may undertake must be 
undertaken voluntarily by each member of the student body. Just 
what form his assistance may take, depends largely upon the train­
ing of the individual. If he be a chemist, his greatest service can 
be rendered to our people in the industrial field.
If he be a machinist, a forge or foundry man, perhaps his pri­
mary duty may require him to enter the factories, and push the pro­
duction of supplies with all his might. It he be an actor, it is pos­
sible that his greatest assistance may take the form of using his 
art to help relieve the mental and physical strain under which his 
co-workers will be laboring. - But in any case, the training in co­
ordination of mind and body, which invariably accompanies, to 
some degree at least, the courses of study in any department of our 
Institute, cannot fail to make a student of Tech better qualified to 
discharge his obligations to his country and his people than a person 
not so ¦trained.
The duty, therefore, of every Tech man and girl is obvious. 
We must select that field in •Which we can do the most, or permit 
ourselves to be selected by Government agencies which know better 
than we what service we can render best, and then work*as hard 
as our strength allows. To discover how we can help the Nation, 
to formulate plans for the immediate future, and to effect a per­
manent organization for the purpose of drill in military duties, a 
mass mooting has been called for tomorrow in Room 104 industries 
at 4:30 p. m. Every man who signed a card, at tho Preparedness 
Assembly Iasi; week, or since that time, is expected to be present. 
That means 800 men at least. At this meeting both the students 
nml members ol! the advisory committee ol! tho faculty will give 
their opinions, and a permanent organization will be formed to bc- 
,v;in military drill. Tho men back ol' the idea hope to have the ac­
tual drill under way the week following the Easter recess. Arms 
and equipment will come later in the year, if the expocted progress 
is made, but now

In spite of the inclement weather

Never in the history of the organiza­

shown.
After an appetizing and substantial 
meal, those present were favored with 
a short talk by Professor Aude. He 
spoke of "Preparedness,” and its rela­
tion to tlie school during the present 
crisis. President I-Iofstetter outlined 
plans for the future, suggesting the 
appointment of a committee to inves­
tigate a house for tho New York Club, 
and one also to arrange a smoker and 
a dance.
Although the club has not appeared 
to be prominent among school organi­
zations it is by no moans dead. Diir 
ing the Christmas holidays, banquets 
were hold in a half-dozen cities 
throughout tho state. The Buffalo del­

DEAN LEETE
With the coming of April 1st, John Hopkins Lecte severs his 
official connection with the Institute of Technology as an adminis­
trative officer. Since the time nine years ago, when he became 
Dean, the School of Applied Science has made such phenomenal 
strides that whereas it once was crowded along with the Design 
School in what is now the Industries group, it now occupies two of 
the largest groups upon tho campus and ranks among the two or 
three really great engineering schools in the AYestern Hemisphere. 
No small part of this achievement is due directly to the executive 
ability and downright hard work of the retiring Dean. It is with 
genuine regret that the Tartan sees Dean Leete go to the Library 
as Director. That the Library will benefit from his knowledge and 
experience, no less than has the School of Applied Science, goes 
without saying. The Tartan wishes him all good fortune in his new 
responsibility and hopes that at Science Sehool affairs he will still 
be a familiar figure.
THE RADIO PLANT
In the event of hostilities with foreign powers, the Institute is 
well- prepared to turn over to the Government one of the most 
powerful wireless stations in 1 lie country. Located as it is in the 
very heart of the stool and munitions district of Pittsburgh, pos­
sessed of almost unlimited power generated directly beneath it, 
this installation is capable of rendering very valuable service at any 
rimo and in (lie case of interfercnoo, cither by storm or human ac- 
tivity, witli tho usual modes of oommumcation by telephone or tele­
graph, ils use might become indispensable. The Radio Club has 
an excellent opportunity to help in the general scheme of getting 
the Nation ready, by training ils members to handle the apparatus 
with rapidity and precision.

Tho Dorm Bible Class enjoyed an 
interesting talk on the Christian Sol­
dier of Today by Mr. Ii. A. Calder- 
wood, of the electrical department of 
the Industries School. He is a man 
who believes in what he says and who 
has had a wide experience in Bible 
Class work. He was one of the pro­
moters of the present Y. M. C. A. 
movement that was started here last 
year.
Next Sunday afternoon there will 
be another interesting speaker. Come 
and see what these meetings are like. 
They are held every Sunday afternoon, 
right after dinner hour, at 2:15, in 
the West Dorm Club room

A most pleasant liouse-dance was 
enjoyed by the members of the Delta 
Epsilon Omega Fraternity last Satur­
day evening at the fraternity house, 
4 G00 Forbes street. The interior of 
the house was decorated for the occa­
sion and concealed behind a bower of 
palms and ferns the Bowen Orchestra. 
At a late hour refreshments were 
served, after which the dancing was 
resumed and lasted until midnight. 
The chaperons were Mr. and Mrs. 
Harry L. Gage and Mr. and Mrs. Har­

He then explained in detail the plant 
which he has installed for the Byers 
Co., and discussed some of the trouble 
which has arisen in the operation of 
such plants.
Mr. R.enkin was field engineer for 
the construction of a large blast fur­
nace and- steel works in India for 
eight years, and during part of this 
time was British magistrate with jur­
isdiction over ninety thousand na­
tives. He speaks three native lan­
guages and enjoys the distinction of 
being one of seven white men who 
have been taken into native tribes. 
Mr. Renkin gave a short talk upon his 
work in the jungle and his impres­
sions of the, natives, a subject which 
he is well qualified to discuss since 
for two years he and his wife were the 
only white persons in the colony.
The Society is very fortunate in se­
curing such a speaker, and everyone 
regretted that there was not sufficient 
time for other tales of adventure in 
the Far East.

Promptly at 11 o’clock Friday even­
ing, the Duquesne Orchestra -struck 
up a grand march, and some seventy 
New England men with their ladies 
skated onto the smooth ice. This 
opened the first New England skating 
party, which proved so successful that 
another event of the same kind is 
coming.
There were twelve numbers on the 
program, four of which were in the 
dark. From these the reporter was 
barred, so no further details are 
available. At intermission the sport 
of "cracking the whip” sent some of 
the'skaters to various corners of the 
rink only to return for another sendoff 
from the end of the line.
Tlie Duquense management merits 
the thanks of every N. E. man for 
their splendid co-operation to make 
the skating party a success. Their 
\ care for details and kindly assistance 
. can not be too well spoken of • by
’^od the party.

Mr. Cecil Sharpe, the great teacher 
of English Folk dancing, will be with 
the dramatic department this week. 
It is a great privilege to have this op­
portunity to study with Mr. Sharpe,* 
as he deserves all the credit of bring­
ing these folk dances with their orig- 
onal music before the public. It is his 
desire to keep the dances as nearly 
like the primitive dances of our an­
cestors as possible. He has visited 
among the peasants and fishermen of 
England, where he, has found, pre­
served with ancient customs and folk­
lore, many of the dances in their orig­
inal form.
Not long ago, he made a discovery 
here in the mountains of the Caro-, 
linas, a little group of people who had 
preserved for over two hundred years’ 
many of the folk dances of their an­
cestors.
Mr. B. Iden Payne is expected the 
last part of the week to select the 
cast and start rehearsals of "Rich­
ard II.”
On Wednesday evening of this week 
there will be a performance of Henrik 
Ibsen’s “Pillars of Society” for the 
students. Tickets may be obtained 
from Miss Bennett.

Immediately after the General As­
sembly in the Music Hall, last Wed­
nesday afternoon, the Sophomore 
Civils had a little assembly of their 
own in front of the Music Hall and 
then went on a swimming party. With 
them, as guests, went Professor C. B. 
Stanton, Mr. Offinger and Mr. Watson. 
After an enjoyable swim, the Civils 
took in a “movie” before having dinner 
at the Royal Restaurant. After eating, 
the party adjourned to the New Davis 
Theater, where they witnessed the 
show.
Mr. Offinger, the new gymnasium in­
structor, turned the swim into a 
fancy diving contest. As leader, in a 
game of “follow the leader,” he did 
the jack-knife dive, the swan uive, the 
backward dive, the twisting dive and 
many other difficult dives.— His fol­
lowers were equally proficient. How­
ard Roberts did the best standing-sit- 
ting-standing dive, while Jim Toler 
missed the board by an inch in the 
backward-front dive.
At the Royal, where the Civils en­
joyed a savory meal, Butts and Mills 
made a hit with a pretty waitress. The 
fair maiden smiled when she looked 
at Butts, but on looking at Mills she 
burst out laughing. After three min­
utes of this, she hid behind a counter 
until she was able to resume work, 
still blushing. Professor Stanton’s 
restraining influence was all that held 
Butts in check thereafter.
After dinner, the D^vis was next on 
the program and they adjourned 
thither. Here Butts burst out again 
with some attempts at music, but was 
promptly squelched by an usher. At 
11:15 the party broke up.

Unusual interest is being centered 
upon a decidedly new departure in the 
methods of securing positions for 
Tech graduates which is being tried 
out in the Commercial Engineering 
Department. The members of Dr. 
Blakey’s Course in Selling, and a num­
ber of other Commercials who ex­
pressed an interest in the movement 
have been the subjects of the exper­
iment and are awaiting the results 
with interest.
During the last two weeks every 
man has .been put through a series of 
tests designed to determine his native 
intellectual ability, his foresight and 
constructive imagination, the speed 
and system with which he does his 
work, his ability to do a certain type 
of synthetic reasoning, the general 
range of his interests, and his ability 
to judge men.
Aside from his general ability as 
estimated by these tests, it was1 
thought wise to have the efficiency of 
each man estimated by a number of 
employment experts who were actual­
ly engaged in this work in large or­
ganizations in Pittsburgh. According­
ly, sales managers and employment di­
rectors of the Western Electric Com­
pany, the Doubleday-I-Iill Company, 
and the Carnegie Steel Company, upon 
invitation, assembled at the School of 
Applied Science last Monday after­
noon, and each man was given a per­
sonal intervieAV by each of the offi­
cials.
Each interviewer had accessible the 
scholastic record of each student, his 
instructors’ estimates of his rating in 
various traits and a written applica­
tion blank on which the student stated 
among other things his schooling and 
his business experience during the 
last five years. He also made a writ­
ten statement of the reasons why ho 
thought that he could succeed in a sell­
ing position.
A bit of novelty was introduced into 
these interviews by the fact that each 
student had prepared beforehand a 
five-minute sales talk on a commodity 
of his own choosing, and that talk ho 
presented to the interviewer who in 
case acted as a possible buyer. The 
student could, however, if ho chose, 
support his written application for a 
position and “sell his services” in 
preference to selling some commodity. 
The interviewer then estimated the 
student’s possible future value to his 
selling organization, basing his judg 
menl upon a comparison with the 
members of his sales force with re­
spect to the number of qualities con 
sidered essential to a successful sales­
man.
The men’s ratings as estimated by 
the tests, and by the interviewers, 
their scholastic standing in their class, 
and other data of possible value to 
the prospective employer will be 
placed on file in the Commercial En­
gineering Department, and with the 
Bureau of Recommendations. On the 
basis of this data the men will be rec­
ommended for employment in posi­
tions which it is thought they will fill 
adequately and satisfactorily.

The sale of the 1917 Thistle closed 
last week with an official number of 
1,138 books sold. This was 138 in ex­
cess of the expectations of the board 
and as a result every member is wear­
ing a pleasant smile. Yet there is a 
hint at a worried expression there 
also. This results from the fact that 
there is still some promised material 
and pictures which have not yet been 
turned in. The negligent parties 
should give the matter their imme­
diate attention.
Since the sale of books has closed 
and the order has gone forward to the 
publisher, no more orders can be ac­
cepted by any agent. Any one who 
has neglected to order his copy and 
wishes to do so should see the sales- 
manager, R. T. Soule, at once.
All indications point to the fact that 
the 1917 Thistle is going to be one of 
the finest books that lias yet appeared 
under that title. The support which 
has been given by the student body In 
the large advance order for books, 
which far eclipses that of last year, 
has helped to make this possible. The 
wealth of material and special fea­
tures of the book have been previous­
ly elaborated on in these columns, and 
it only remains to say that Tech will 
be proud of the book when- it appears.

Introductory Remarks
In taking up the study of Infantry 
Drill Regulations it is important that 
the student should know something of 
the history and development of our 
present system, and a short sketch is 
therefore given of the growth of Amer­
ican tactics. This is valuable as a 
matter of history and should be care­
fully read.
These regulations, which are before 
you, are the official rules adopted by 
the War Department for the instruc­
tion of infantry troops in military tac­
tics. By tactics we mean the art of 
handling troops in the field. The 
term is often confused - with strategy, 
but there is a wide difference which 
must be learned by the student. 
Strategy is the art of bringing the 
enemy to battle on terms disadvanta­
geous to himself. Tactics includes 
those means by which the command­
ing officer moves his troops to accom­
plish the purposes of strategy. The 
terms are not in the least inter­
changeable. An officer may be a great 
strategist and a very ordinary tacti­
cian, while he may be a master of tac­
tics but know little of strategy.
Prior to the Revolutionary War, the 
military instruction which was re­
ceived by the colonial troops engaged 
in the various Indian wars, was de­
rived entirely from the English. Most 
of the colonists being English-speak­
ing people, it was but natural that 
their laws, customs, and usages 
should have come from the mother 
country Therefore, the first military 
tactics in tills country wore English. 
During the early part of the war of 
the Revolution the American troops 
were drilled by these same tactics. 
As the war. progressed, a great many 
soldiers of fortune came from Euro­
pean countries seeking employment 
in the American army. Among these 
was Baron do Steuben, who was au­
thorized in 177!) by the Continental 
Congress to prepare an abridgement 
of the Prussian tactics. This abridge­
ment was used by the United States 
Army until the commencement of the 
War of 1812, and by the militia until 
1820. In 1812 a vory Imperfect abridge­
ment of the French tactics of 1791, by 
General Alexander Smyth, was pub­
lished under the sanction of the War 
Department. In 1813 Lieutenant Col­
onel William Duano produced a hand­
book of Instruction for the squad and 
company, which was used to some ex­
tent in the army. In 1818 Congress 
requested the President to have pre 
pared for its approval a “military sys­
tem of discipline for the infantry of 
the army and the militia of the United 
States.” Tills resolution was not 
acted upon, owing to the occupation 
of the officers with field service, and 
during the War of 1812 tactical in­
struction was in a state of chaos, 
every officer practically being a law 
•unto himself. In 1814, General Scott 
used in the instruction of two bri­
gades a poor translation of MacDon­
ald’s French tactics which had been 
published in Boston by De Lacroix. 
This was the first introduction of the 
Fr,ench system in its entirety. With 
some modifications, it was adopted by 
the War Department, and is known as 
“the system of 1815.” It was used by 
the militia and was made compulsory 
in 1820. “The system of .1825” was 
adopted by a board consisting of Gen­
erals Scott, Brady, Fenwick, Thayer, 
and Worth. It was originally taken 
by the French from the Prussian sys­
tem of Frederick the Great, and was 
used throughout the Revolutionary 
and Napoleonic wars of France. Un­
der the authority of Congress, General 
Scott in 1834 prepared the adaptation 
of the Prussian system known by his 
name. The improvement in firearms 
finally compelled a change from the 
former movements of Scott, and 
Hardee’s translation of the French 
system for their Chasseurs a pied 
(Infantry) was adopted as far as the 
school of the battalion. From its pe­
culiar double-quick step, it was famil­
iarly known as the “Shanghai Drill." 
Casey's revision of Hardee's tactics 
was authorized during the Civil War, 
and continued in use until 1807, when 
General Upton, one of the ablest mil­
itary writers this country has over 
produced, revised the system and Up­
ton's tactics were adopted for use by 
the army and continued in use for a 
great many years. They were super­
seded by the Infantry Drill Regula­
tions, which were adopted in 1891, in 
which a great many changes were 
made. These were followed by the 
Regulations of 1904, which were again 
changed in 1911. These Drill Regula­
tions of 1911, with subsequent changes 
made by the War Department, consti-

tute the system of instruction now in 
use by the army and the militia. It 
will be observed from reading the 
above summary, that American tactics 
are largely derived from the Prussians 
with some French modifications. The 
most significant fact to be noted in 
examining the various regulations un­
der which the American Army has 
worked is the constant tendency on 
the part of the War Department 10 re­
duce military movements to their 
lowest terms, to avoid cumbersome 
and showy formations, and to teach 
the movements of troops in the sim­
plest possible form.
Lesson

On Monday evening, March 20, the 
Night Science men bade a regretful 
farewell to their dean.
Classes were dismissed at 8:30 and 
each hied himself to the Union Hall, 
where perhaps the biggest assembly of 
Night Science students of Carnegie 
Tech ever drawn together met to show 
Dr. Leel:e the honor and esteem in 
which they hold him.
While the students were assembling 
"Sklnk” pounded the keys and helped 
dispel the gloom that seemed to make 
the air a trifle heavy, and Mr. Mc- 
Michaels of the fourth year addressed 
his opening remarks to men, who, it 
was apparent, had decidod to make 
the dean’s memory of the evening a 
happy one.
"Mike,” who was responsible for 
most of the nrrangoinents, Is not alone 
a good organizer—he is an interesting 
talker. He was grateful to the student 
body for the support they gave him in 
making the meeting possible, and was 
gratified indeed at the collogo spirit 
which Is becoming so evidently one of 
the benefits night men are beginning 
to derive from their association with 
the schools, llo admired the mombors 
of the present flfth year class. They, 
more perhaps than any previous class, 
are showing how possible II. Is to cope 
with the "study" hurdles and at the 
same time get close together socially, 
and make brothers of follow students. 
He wished that all might emulate 
them. Referring to the newly or­
ganized fraternity, "Kloneeht,” ho ex­
horted the membership by showing in 
their efforts to further the Scope and 
achievements of the -night activities 
that "their heart is in the work.’’ He 
then called on the "man of the hour,” 
and Dean Leete, in his address to the 
night science students, drew the tie 
that binds us to him still closer. We 
Students ourselves know that we are 
losing one of our best friends, but 
what makes us almost happy in the 
loss is the conviction he planted in 
our minds by his earnestness that he, 
too, is losing friends. We are proud 
he looks on us in that light. He spoke 
with feeling of the regrets he felt at 
leaving "Dear Old Tech,” and traced 
briefly his connection with it. He 
gazed back wistfully, but with appar­
ent and justifiable pride, and pictured 
to us the years he spent in helping 
nurse the tender and precious baby. 
It is now only an eleven-year-old baby, 
but it is a prodigy of strength already 
felt throughout the entire country. 
The aims of the faculty body with re­
gard to the night school, he said, 
might be summed up as follows: First, 
to teach men to do better that which 
they could do best, and, second, to in­
spire the wish to do best of all men 
that which they could do best. He 
pointed out the common mistaken 
opinion that day students have an ad­
vantage ovor night students in that 
they have moro time to spend togotlior 
and consequently derive the beneflts 
of the "rubhlng-up" process. As he 
pointed out, the business world and 
the shop may offer a hard and at times 
painful training, but if tho article Is 
of tho right material, tho finished pro­
duct Is comparable with any.
in closing he thanked tho "Klanlcht” 
for their arrangements which gave 
him the opportunity to make his adieu 
to tho night students.
Prof. Stanton was the next speaker 
called on. We naturally associated 
him with things military, and he asked 
the men present to carefully consider 
their duty to their country in the pres­
ent national crisis. He knew that once
convinced of their duty there would 
be no lagging in its execution. He ad­
vised students who'decided on action 
to try for admission to the Officers' 
Reserve Corps, pointing out that only 
7,000 officer's are holding commissions 
where 50,000 are needed.
Mr. Shinkle in a felicitous speech, 
then presented Dean Leete on behalf 
of the Night Science School, with a 
leather upholstered arm chair, as a 
token of the very high respect and es­
teem in which they hold him, and in 
appreciation of the many kindnesses 
and of the consideration he has at all 
times shown the night science stu­
dents, individually and collectively. 
He hoped that the dean would have 
more hours of leisure to spend in rest­
ful ease In his new position than he 
had had in the one he leaves, and 
hoped that he might occasionally think 
of the time he had been connected 
with Carnegie Tech, and experience 
nothing but pleasure in the memory.
Dean Leete responded with a few 
graceful remarks, and thanked the 
men for their regard adding the wish 
that they might think of him as re-, 
dining easily in the chair presented 
him rather than as some might picture 
him, as in a hard uncomfortable office 
desk chair with his head wearily sup­
ported on the open leaves of a dic­
tionary.
Dean Mott on being called on for a 
few remarks, expressed himself as 
wishing only to be able to live up to 
the standard set by the retiring dean 
in the execution of his office. He 
pledged his good services to the night 
science men, hoping for their full- 
hearted co-operation and assuring 
them that his help and guidance would 
be at their continual service.
Several entertaining features were 
interspersed during the evening, 
which filled up the corners and made 
it without a doubt the biggest night 
Night Science has ever had.
McKee walked away with a pie-eat­
ing contest, and “Godbey” and “Kid 
Foster,” two fourth year rivals, set a 
hot pace in a three-round bout. Sev­
eral musical numbers were tendered, 
a duet by Tilton and Allen, and solos 
by the former, with Cramer accom­
panying.
Leans Leete and Mott then led an 
onslaught on cake, ice cream and 
coffee in the “Beanery” and judging 
from the vigorous attack the students 
made, I can confidently commend 
night science students to the recruit­
ing officers as being good fighting ma­
terial.
of 48 hours was held Friday and Sat­

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
Two very interesting “projects” 
wore finished Saturday night at twelve 
bells. The Class “B” plan problem 
was “A Stairway.” The solution of 
this problem was very difficult and de­
manded a good deal of stuGy. As a 
result some very satisfactory draw­
ings are submitted for judgment to 
the Beaux Arts Society next month.
Likewise, the "Order” problem was 
of the same caliber, so that some of 
tho boys had to do without their face 
massages the last week. Possibly a 
greater variety of “projects” than ever 
before wore presented for this coming 
judgment.
The Loeb prize preliminary sketch
(Continued From Page One.l 
tion the extraordinary opportunity 
which is now open to them. On my 
recommendation, the Secretary of 
War has removed all preliminary tests 
and formalities, so that now the ques­
tion of appointment will be solely de­
cided by a single competitive examina­
tion to be held during the week be­
ginning June 25, 1917.
2. The requirements are that the 
young men shall be (a) unmarried at 
the time of their examination and ap­
pointment; (b) between 21 and 29 
years of age; (c) graduates of ap­
proved technical schools, among which 
your institution is, of course, included.
3. The young men who are ap­
pointed to the Corps of Engineers 
will have exceptional opportunity for 
advancement and for important and 
interesting service. The work which 
they will be called upon to do as of­
ficers in the United States Army will 
include not only the military work 
which is necessary to enable them to 
function properly as part of the Army 
of the United States, but they will 
also have extensive civil engineering 
work in connection with the public 
works of the United States, including 
River and Harbor works, works of 
Flood Control, Municipal Engineering 
in the District of Columbia, and road 
work in certain National Parks and 
in Alaska. Their engineering experi­
ences will, therefore, be of the highest 
grade and will offer an opportunity 
for the exercise of the best talent.
4. For these reasons, it is hoped 
that some of your best graduates of 
this year in the engineering branches, 
including not only the civil engineers, 
but also graduates in electrical and 
mechanical engineering, will become 
candidates for these appointments. 
The number of vacancies which will 
be open on the first of July this year 
cannot be definitely stated until after 
the session of Congress, but there will 
be at least 50 vacancies and may be 
as many as 90. Under these condi­
tions, it is evident that properly qual­
ified young men should receive ap­
pointments.
5. I am enclosing a copy of the 
Orders of the War Department gov­
erning these appointments, copy of 
the examination which was held in 
August of last year, and application 
blank—of all of which I shall be glad 
to furnish further copies on request. 
I would invite especial attention to 
the fact that the paragraphs of Gen­
eral Orders 26, War Department, re­
lating to a preliminary civil service 
examination is not to be considered, 
for the reason that the Secretary of 
War, under authority of law, has au­
thorized the omission of this require­
ment.
Very respectfully,
W. M. BLACK, 
Brig. Gen., Chief of Engineers.
