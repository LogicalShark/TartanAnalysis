Legality Question Arises 
In SG Senate Elections
The Student Senate Rules Committee is meeting this 
week to decide the status of Dale Peschel, a late applicant 
for candidacy in the upcoming election for President of 
Student Government
Peschel, a junior mechanical 
engineering major, submitted 
his presidential nomination pet- 
i'ion several days after the 
March 14 deadline for petitions1. 
Ray Guydosh, chairman of the 
Rules Committee, says Peschel 
probably will not be recognized 
as an official candidate and 
probably won’t have his name 
printed on the ballots.
He might, however, be able 
to run as a write-in candidate. 
It is up to the Buies Committee 
to decide the legality of a write- 
in vote.
Elections will be held Tuest- 
day and Wednesday, April 4 and
5. Official candidates so far are 
Bob Albertson, Ron Haan, Rick 
Stafford, and Len Wanetik for 
president; and Bill Fallon, Tom 
Moore, ¡Bob Schulman, and Mike 
Smolens for vice-president.
For the second year in a 
row, there will be no elections 
for Senate representatives. 
Only 14 nominations were 
filed for the 25 Senate seats.
No further nominations will 
be acecpted this year. According 
to Guydosh, the Executive Coun­
cil of Student Government may 
decide to fill the empty seats by 
appointment. Also, there will 
probably be a freshman election 
next fall.
The 14 students who submit­
ted petitions for Senate have 
been automatically appointed. 
They are:
Men’s Dorans: Lawrence E. 
Anderson, Don Baer, and Gary 
Straus. (One empty seat.)
Women’s Dorms: Sandy 
Jones, Susan Plaks, and Jeanne 
Winaras. (One empty seat.)
Fraternities: Bill Benthall,

IDIOTIC APRIL FOOL'S ISSUE 
APRIL 5th, 1967
B. B. Mall, Assistant Treas­
urer, has announced that un­
dergraduates must pay ALL 
their fees at the Cashier’s Of­
fice by Monday, April 10.
Grad Council Expects 
Few Draft Problems
The Council of Graduate Schools in the United States has responded to Presi­
dent Johnson’s March 6 message to Congress concerning proposed changes in the present 
Selective Service Law. The Council's Statement is the following:
Panhel—CFP Conferences 
Propose All-Greek Council
The annual Greek Week meeting of the Council of 
Fraternity Presidents and Pan-Hellenic Council, held Tues­
day, March 14, resulted in plans to form an All-Greek 
Council, composed of Pan-Hel and CFP executive boards.
The decision came at the con­
clusion of the meeting, follow­
ing discussions concerning so­
cial regulations and activities; 
rush; and communications — 
both between Pan-Hel and CFP, 
and between the Greek system 
and the administration.
The new council, which will 
meet on a monthly basis, will 
go into effect when the new 
executive boards have been 
formed. The purpose of the all 
Greek Council is to strengthen 
the Greek system as a whole by 
cooperative measures of CFP 
and Pan-Hel, and to foster com­
munications and understanding 
between the sorority and frater­
nity stems.
Brown Attends 
Drug Workshop
George K. Brown, Dean of 
Student Affairs, and Earl R. 
Swank, Dean of Men, attended 
a Drug Education Workshop in 
Philadelphia March 12 through 
14. The program was sponsored 
by The National Associa­
tion of Student Personnel Ad­
ministrators in cooperation with 
the Food and Drug Administra­
tion.
The purpore of the conference 
was to present educational rep­
resentatives with information 
pro and con on drugs. Experts 
on drugs presented comparative 
problems of drug usuage and 
addiction on college campuses.
Vincent Newlis, professor of 
psychology at the University of 
Rochester, discussed, “The stu­
dent and the College Environ­
ment” Newlis himself has tried 
all the various drugs in exper­
imental conditions» to determine 
reactions, and psychological ef­
fects.
Dean Brown commented that, 
“the workshop was quite profit­
able and helpful.”
Witchner Becomes 
MDC President
A1 Witchner has been elected 
President of Men’s Dormitory 
Council. Walt Panko is new 
Vice-President of MDC, and Les 
Kania has been re-elected as 
Treasurer.
The new officers take over 
the first meeting after Easter, 
Thursday, March 30, at 4:30 pm 
in Welch Hall.
‘The Council of Graduate 
Schools is in constant contact 
with the American Council on 
Education, The Association of 
State Universities and Land 
Grant Colleges and other educa­
tion associations, and is pre­
pared to take such joint action 
as becomes necessary.
“In his message of March 6, 
President Johnson stated that he 
‘will welcome the public discus­
sion which the commission re­
port will surely stimulate and 
. . . will then take that Presi­
dential action which . .. will best 
serve the national interest.’
“The present selective service 
law expires at the end of the 
current fiscal year and is then 
subject to revision by the Con­
gress.
“As far as can be determ­
ined at the present time, the 
prevailing sentiment in the 
Congress (A) favors continua­
tion of educational defer­
ments; (B) favors induction 
by age groups, beginning at 
age 19; (C) opposes a lottery 
system.
The concern of graduate deans 
is directed at Johnson’s state­
ment that, “to correct the in­
qualities in the deferments of 
postgraduate students, I shall 
issue an executive order speci­
fying that no deferments for 
postgraduate study will be 
granted, except for those men 
pursuing medical and dental 
courses.”
Plans Bemain Normal
The Council believes that 
graduate students now in defer­
red status will not be affected 
at all; that deferments of pros­
pective graduate students will 
not be materially diminished; 
and that there will be no wholes 
sale induction of graduating sen­
iors: The Council thus advises 
graduate schools and students 
to preceed with their plans for 
the fall term in the “normal” 
manner.
Under present normal pro­
cedure for graduate defer­
ments. a senior should request 
the graduate school he is plan­
ning to attend to send Selec­
tive Service Form 103 to his 
local draft board. This form, 
stating that the senior has 
been accepted for fall enroll­
ment, should prevent reclass­
ification of the student until 
the student should again have 
his graduate school send Form 
103 to the local board stating 
that he is currently enrolled. 
Thereafter the student should 
see that Form 103 is sent to 
the local board at the begin­
ning and end of each academic 
year.
Under current guidelines, a 
student must rank in the upper 
quarter of his senior class or 
score 80 or higher on the Selec­
tive Service Exam in order to 
obtain graduate deferment. If 
the graduate deferment situa­
tion changes in any way, the 
Council will keep graduate 
schools and students informed.

A Vote
Against Cornet
Editor, the Tartan:
I would like to put my 2c in 
in regard to the somewhat tor­
rid, always exciting Cornet Dos­
sier. I feel qualified to do so on 
two counts: one, I worked on 
the station for two years, one 
of which I was the Head An­
nouncer and resigned because of 
Mr. Cornet; and two, I brought 
Mr. Cornet to the station ori­
ginally.
As a school not equipped with 
a visual aids or radio arts de­
partment Carnegie Tech decided 
to furnish its school with a radio 
station. The purpose of this sta­
tion was not to offer simulating 
programs or compete with any 
other stations. Oddly enough the 
programming had nothing to do 
with the station. The original 
purpose was this: a place where 
the engineering students could 
get “on the job” training in 
radio and electrical circuits, etc. 
It was set up for the reason 
that Mr. Cornet berates it-as a 
playground for engineers.
A radio station cannot exist 
without some sort of quality an­
nouncing. Like it or not, most 
students other than dramats do 
not have trained voices and in­
telligible speech. But drama stu­
dents do not have the free time 
to do all this work on the sta­
tion; therefore, someone should 
train the other students who 
work there. Mr. Cornet’s solu­
tion to this problem was very 
expedient — He did all the an­
nouncing (I retract that, he only 
did most of the announcing, as 
Head Announcer he let me 
speak every now and then).
As a program director Mr. 
Cornet was a failure. He got 
more talk shows on the air, but 
he did not broaden the listening 
audience. He spent a lot of 
money on acquiring a lot of new 
records, but they could have 
been taped at the Carnegie Li­
brary for nothing. The staff on 
WRCT did not get bigger when

Mr. Cornet took over, but smal­
ler. He was forced to take over 
three jobs rather than one, but 
why did these people resign in 
the first place?
In closing, I think that WRCT 
can do without people like Mr. 
Cornet who advocate a violent 
overthrow of the station. I furth­
er think that this campus can 
do without the boobs who pur­
sued the report and pretended 
to veto the budget. If WRCT 
is to improve, and indeed it must 
if it is to survive, the staff must 
grow, and the station must of­
fer unique programming. I for 
one, salute the engineers at 
WRCT who keep it going and on 
the air. I think the rest is up 
to us, the students who must 
give a vote of confidence to the 
station.

Where Was 
IM Coverage?
Editor, the Tartan:
This little letter is to inform 
you that there was an Intramur­
al Basketball Championship. A 
team called the E. J. Bruins be­
came the first independent fresh 
man basketball team ever to 
win the I. M. Championship. The 
Bruins beat PiKA 48-33 on the 
night of March 10, 1967 to be­
come champs. As I read the 
Tartan issue of March 15, I saw 
nothing concerning this game. 
Instead I saw pictures of the ex­
citing Tech Tartans!!!, a team 
that was lead by Jeff Kalin’s 
hook shot, Bay Burdett’s foul­
ing and Don Keefer’s outstand­
ing play. I have nothing against 
Tech Basketball, but the only 
thing good about it this year 
was Don Keefer’s fine play and 
the people who supported the 
team. On the final page of the 
newspaper we also saw a write­
up on IM foulshooting and, of 
all things, Jeff Ruben’s Bridge 
Column. Are you kidding — 
who’s Jeff Ruben?! I don’t want 
to complain, but I think my 
point has been brought out. I 
think it’s about time we have 
better coverage on IM sports, 
especially when something such 
as the E. J. Bruins occurs.

Freshman, Physics
Sports Page 
<Functionless>
The Tartatl "sports page” (Î 
Usé thé term loosely) has tot 
the past year been nearly func- 
tionless. The question everybody 
seems to be asking these days 
is not whether Mr. Sikon has 
the ability to be a competent 
sports editor, but why he hasn’t 
used any of it. A typical exam­
ple of this negligence has been 
the recent coverage of intra­
mural basketball. Basketball 
along with football provides the 
most excitement of the intra­
mural program. During this 
past month 48 teams consisting 
of 474 student athletes partici­
pated, reflecting considerable in­
terest. But yet during the last 
two weeks, when the most im­
portant playoff games were in 
progress, there was absolutely
no indication that IM basketball 
even existed. Since both the 
championship and consolation 
games constituted an all school 
event, with no fraternity parties 
allowed until after the games, 
where was our junior Howard 
Cosell and his cohorts in apa­
thy?
Briefly, the outcomes of the 
key games were: in the semi­
finals a tough E. J. Bruin squad 
led by all-school guard Dennis 
Kavchak jumped off to a quick 
16 point lead over BTP during 
the first half and coasted to a 
44-34 victory. In the second con­
test PKA, relying on the shoot­
ing of Dave Simons and a strong 
zone defense, defeated a talented 
Civil Hammers team, led by 
Mel Ramey, 47-34. On Intramur­
al Night in the consolation game, 
the Hammers built up an early 
lead over BTP and held on to 
win 60-49. In the championship 
game PKA and the Bruins play­
ed evenly for much of the game 
with the Bruins holding a slight 
30-29 lead at the start of the 
fourth quarter. Then PKA’s 
coldness, coupled with the E.J.’s 
hustling, enabled the Bruins to 
win 48-33.
Also not mentioned was Sig­
ma Nu’s wrestling victory as 
well as the fine individual per­
formance in the foul shooting 
competition of BSR’s Tom Mc- 
Enerney who sank 92/100 shots.
Let there be no mistake, there 
was plenty of room in the Tar­
tan for these articles. Last year 
when Mike Vargo was sports 
editor, all of the previous men­
tioned events were covered and 
action pictures included. Five 
large pictures of snowmen did 
not have to be added to fill in 
the unused space.
Our dear sports page also 
lacks in other areas besides the 
IM Review. Originally I was 
puzzled as to the significance of 
the title “The Foul Line,” which 
is the sports editor’s own little 
column to make sure we are all 
up on the “latest” news. I can 
think of no better adjective to 
use in describing his candid 
lines than the one he himself 
has used. The last edition of the 
Tartan can be used as a typical
example. Although my new 
friend did not regurgitate what 
Sport Magazine said two months 
ago, as he usually does, he sub­
mitted an article about our fine 
graduating seniors Don Keefer, 
Ray Burdett, and Jeff Kalin 
which should have been printed 
two weeks ago right before their 
last and most important game 
with Pitt. Although one would 
naturally infer from the article 
that Dick Eckhardt is a grad­
uating senior, this is inaccurate 
as he has one more year of eli­
gibility.
In order to make an interest­
ing column, Mr. Sikon should 
feel free to express his own 
opinion, or at least one that re­
flects a little original thinking or 
initiative. Rather than comment 
on the national sport scene, 
which is adequately covered by 
professional writers, he should 
limit himself to something he 
is qualified to discuss with 
authority. Something along this 
line might have been an inter­
view with Coach Fassinger, ask­
ing why Neil Houser was not 
used during the last four games 
of the season. Taking nothing 
away from Neil’s replacement, 
he is not nearly the ball player 
Houser is. The outcome of the 
Pitt game may have been com­
pletely different had Houser 
played. A bold attack on the 
coach’s decisions by the sports 
editor would have surely added 
some interest to his column if 
nothing else. This letter has al­
ready become grossly too long, 
so I’ll make no other complaints 
and wait quietly for the new 
regime to come into power.

April Showings Set
For Film Program
A new program of Under­
ground and Experimental 
films will be presented by x 
the Carnegie Tech Experi­
mental Film Group Tuesday 
and Wednesday, April 4 and 
5, at Porter Hall 100. Screen­
ings will be at 4:30, 7 and 
9:30 pm on Tuesday, April 
4, and 6, 8, and 10 pm on 
Wednesday, April 5. GradCo
sion is 75 cents.
Featured on the program will 
be George Kuchar’s Hold Me 
While I’m Naked, heralded in 
the April issiie of Playboy Mag­
azine in its feature story on 
Underground Movies, part of its 
regular series on the history of 
sex in the cinema.
Also included in the pro- § 
gram, and spotlighted in the 
same Playboy article, is Plas­
tic Haircut, a film by Robert 
Nelson, who created the wide- 
ly-acclaimed Oh Dem Water­
melons. Ed Emshwiller, one 
of the most successful and 
popular of the Underground 
film-makers, discussed at }) 
length in the Playboy article, 
will be represented by Trans­
formations.
A special feature of the pro­
gram will be a rare version of 
the classic film, Fall of the 
House of Usher, by Watson and 
Webber. The techniques used in 
this film in 1927, and in their 
later film, Lot in Sodom, are 
still being imitated today.
A number of other films will 
also be shown, including Bum- 
blebird, a satire on the White 
House by Pete Weiner, and 
Shoot the Actor, by Abramson 
and Frawley, a blood and guts )) 
mystery film, one of the few 
films of this genre to come out 
of the Underground. Shoot the 
Actor has received much critical 
praise at recent showings at two 
of the citadels of the Under­
ground movie movement, the 
Gate Theatre in New York and 
the Aardvark Cinamatheque in 
Chicago.

East was probably afraid to 
open due to the unfavorable 
vulnerability, and West conse­
quently never got a chance to 
bid his six - card spade suit. 
North-South were virtually un­
club ruff. Four spades is a cold 
contract for East and West, and 
five diamonds is down only one 
trick. Thus East’s bidding show­
ed a lack of heart which more 
than made up for his lack of 
hearts.
