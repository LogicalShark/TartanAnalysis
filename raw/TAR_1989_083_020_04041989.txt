In an effort to protest massive tray thefts from the 
Morewood dining facilities, Carnage Mellon Dining 
Dis-service employees built a shanty made entirely of 
trays on the Cut last week.
Morewood Dining Dis-services Director Myron 
Sherry said the move was a last ditch effort by CMDD 
to draw attention to rampant tray pilferage. Said 
Sherry, “We tried askingnicely, and we were ignored. 
We tried signs;-and they were stolen. We even tor­
tured a few students, but even that failed to solve the 
problem. We were willing to try anything.”
It was at this point, Sherry said, that CMDD em­
ployees took the cue from the Anti-Apartheid/Divest- 
ment protestors. “We saw from them what an effec­
tive method of protest shanty-building was,” said 
Sherry. Consequently, the group constructed a small 
shanty on the Cut between Skibop and Donut Hole.
The CMDD effort was doomed to fail, however, 
since the shanty was erected during spring break, 
limiting its exposure. “It was our understanding that 
spring break was next week,” said one employee.
The final death knell fell on the group’s efforts 
when tray shortages necesitated dissasembly of the 
shanty the next day. “What can I say?” said Sherry. 
“We needed the trays.”

Stupid Senate shuts down Natrat, charges editor Piercing
By DAWN OF THE DEADLY
Natrat Detracting Editor
Stupid Senate has locked The 
Natrat staff out of its suite of 
offices in response to accusations 
that Natrat Gossip Editor Louden 
Piercing has misused Natrat 
funds.
However, being complete bone- 
heads, the Senate forgot to dis­
connect The Natrat’s network 
connection, allowing this issue to 
be published from various Macin­
toshes around campus.
Piercing is charged with spend-
ing over $1100 on last semester’s 
board dinner at the Natrat Grill. 
He denied the charge, saying 
“That’s ridiculous. If we had eaten 
$1100 worth of Natrat Grill food 
we would have been barfing for 
weeks. Plus which, the money 
would have come back to us any­
way. We own the Natrat Grill. 
That’s why it has that name. We 
also own all the sports teams.
“In fact, we own most of this 
university. Dick Cyrat is paid out 
of my discretionary fund and the 
buildings aren’t really named 
after presidents of Carnage Tech,
Geeks request 37% 
activity fee kickback
By STU PID
Natrat Sycophant
An anonymous proposal, signed by 384 geeks, has been filed 
with Stupid Senate, requesting that it return 37 percent of the 
activities fees to geeks.
The proposal claims that since geeks to do not participate in any 
campus activities, they are entitled to at least 37 percent of their 
money back. The last known geek attempt to assimilate into CMU 
society occurred in 1983, before the release of Android.
Geek leaders claimed to be surprised by the announcement of 
the proposal. “It was supposed to be a secret!” wailed Greasy 
Goober, a senior Math-CS student.
Stupid Senate has expressed interest in the proposal. An ex­
change of the money for a guarantee not to leave Wean Hall has 
been greeted with enthusiam by several H&BestGuess Senators.
A Natrat source said, “Gee, if we could get rid of the geeks, I 
wouldn’t be embarrased to tell people I go to Carnage Mellon. No 
more Diskette Days, heck we might even be able to get some 
women to come here!”
“We own most of this university.... 
Face it, we own everything."

they’re named afterformerNatrat 
Gossip Editors. The newhundred- 
story obscene language studies 
building we’re working on is going 
to be named after me. Face it, we 
own everything; heh, heh, heh.” 
Piercing said that he thinks
Senate’s action actually hadnoth- 
ing to do with his use of Natrat 
funds. He traces the action to an 
ad the Natrat ran encouraging 
students to forgo high paying jobs 
and enter public service profes­
sions instead.
Former Lame Duck Student 
Government President Randy 
Robocop disputed the accusation, 
saying “We do feel that the ad 
was contrary to the principles of 
this institution but that’s not the 
reason for our action. Off the 
record [oops], we feel he is too 
loud to be Natrat Gossip Editor. 
We had a similar problem with 
[former Natrat Gossip Editor 
Russel] Egg-man. He was too 
short but he never spent a dime 
on anything so we weren’t ever 
able to nail him for misuse of 
funds.”
Multimillionaire Donald Trump succeeds in 
small-change Carnage Mellon takeover bid
By STU PID
Natrat Clone 
& STU PID 
Natrat Clone
After months of negotiations, 
multimillionaire, egotistical, 
self-righteous, half-witted, ar­
rogant, tacky, real-estate devel­
oper Donald Trump has bought 
Carnage Mellon University for 
a figure in excess of $1.98. The 
deal comes weeks after a Cush­
man Cart mechanics strike had 
crippled the overpriced Univer­
sity.
In a Pittsboro news confer­
ence Saturday, Trump an­
nounced the deal. “Carnage 
Mellon University isyet another 
fine American institution that 
will bear the Trump name. I am
pleased to add it to my toys.” 
Trump is the latest of many 
corporate raiders to buy large 
research universities since Black 
Monday. Carl Ichan started the 
trend by negotiating a leveraged 
buyout of Harvard University, 
followed by T. Boone Pickens’ stun­
ning battle to acquire Stanford.
According to Gladman Socks 
analyst Big Bucks, Big Bucks, No 
Whammies, Stop!, “Colleges are 
the perfect investment in today’s 
shaky economy. They require little 
or no maintenance, bring in large 
amounts of cash, and are easy 
ways to get co-eds otherwise un­
available to boring, self-centered 
yuppies.”
While Trump’s plans for Car­
nage Mellon are still hazy, a few 
facts were made available to the
public last week. For starters, the 
school will be renamed Trump 
University after remodeling this 
summer.
Trump intends to name his wife 
Ivana as the University’s new 
President. “She’ll get $1 a year 
salary and all of the textbooks she 
can buy,” quipped Trump. The 
salaiy would be a bargain for 
Trump, considering that his for- 
mer-model wife learned to read 
only last year.
Student leader reaction to the 
purchase was mostly negative. 
H&BestGuess Stupid Senator 
That Rube authored a strongly 
worded resolution claiming, “You 
didn’t tell us he was buying the 
University! You can’t do that! We 
get to choose the next President, 
and when we do, he’ll be a liberal!”

Carnage Mellon on Briefs
What the hell are you doing?
Why are you looking here for news? You idiot, we hork every­
thing in “Carnage Mellon on Briefs” from the PR Department. 
You could have read all this stuff last Friday in “The 8 1/2 by 11 
News,” available where better newspapers and magazines are 
sold on campus. Basically, all we do here at The Natrat is 
plagarize things anyway; this column exists only to fill space. 
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? We’re telling you, don’t 
read this. It’s a waste of your time. GO GET A LIFE, WOULD 
YA?
Penguins get their own month
Yesterday, Mayor Sophie Masloff declared April “Adopt-A- 
Penguin Month in Pittsburgh.” The promotion is an attempt to 
raise money for the much-needed renovation of the penguin 
exhibit at the Pittsburgh Zoo.
Look, we aren’t shittingyou — this is for real. Trailers promot­
ing the adoption of a penguin will be shown on Pittsburgh area 
Cinema World Screens. Included in the adoption package — 
which will run you $20 — will be a Cinema World movie pass, a 
Cameron Coca-Cola coupon, a free family visit to the Pittsburgh 
Zoo, and information on the adopted penguin. Adoption applica­
tions are available at all Cinema World theaters.
Honestly, this is not a joke. It’s for real.
This is the weekly headline about 
SEI protestor Vinnie Ernie
Well, not much happened in Vinnie’s life last week. No vigils, 
no protests, no press conferences, no arrests. Yawn. “Protesting 
SEI is tough work,” Vinnie told The Natrat. “I figure I deserve 
time off as much as any student.”
Vinnie did enjoy his spring break, however. He says that he 
“managed to tie up all those loose ends,” working in a trip to 
Giant Eagle and Rite-Aid between reading two books on the 
science of protesting: How to be a Nuisance — and Get Noticed 
and Personal Hygeine for the State-of-the-Art Protestor.
Shoot to Kill becomes real-life in Natrat Grill
Grad student takes out video aggression on bystanders
Oxyacetylene Welding Studies Student Quincy Quibble dodges behind a video game in front of the Natrat 
Grill Thursday. Quibble got fed up with Operation Wolf and went on a shooting spree, leaving two students 
injured and ten video games dead.

NATRAT GRILL, USA — A 
frustrated student, angered athis 
increasingly low scores on the 
Operation Wolf video game, en­
listed the help of an M-15 rocket 
launcher machine gun, held two 
students hostage and destroyed 
ten video games Thursday in front 
of the Natrat Grill.
Quincy Quibble, a fifth year 
Oxyacetylene Welding Studies 
graduate student, entered the 
video arcade at approximately 
3:45 pm with a stolen M-15.
Witnesses say that Quibble, 
with M-15 in hand, inserted a 
quarter into the machine, then 
proceeded to play the game with 
the actual machine gun rather 
than the simulated Uzi supplied 
by the game manufacturers.
After putting his foot through a 
pinball machine, Quibble grabbed 
two hostages, Alfred Unster and 
Genco Dominidambano, both 
Carnage Mellon students. 
Quibble grabbed the two, forced 
them under a pool table and held 
them at pool cuestick point, 
screaming, “Eight ball in the cor­
ner! Cue ball in the side!”
Carnage Mellon Alcohol Patrol 
arrived on the scene an hour later 
to ambush Quibble. Quibble pro­
ceeded to punch his fist through 
the Punch Out machine and de­
stroy nine other games.

The two hostages were freed

The Natrathas obtained a copy 
of the Presidential Search Com­
mittee’s list of candidates for 
President Cyrat’s successor.
The list of candidates was 
leaked to the press by Steev Stein­
berg, dean of H&BestGuess. “I 
didn’t know the list was secret," 
Steinberg said.
Upon learning that The Natrat 
was given the list, University 
Pervert The Angel Jordache was 
quick to make a statement: 
“Pleeeeeeeeease don’t print it," 
he whined.
The Natrat attempted to get 
further details from Steinberg, 
but he just kept repeating, “Sta­
tistics is neat.”
Here is the list of 10 names,

ment of each candidate’s qualifi­

Center to be funded by student fees
By BICYCLE SMARTS
Natrat Plagarizer
Dr. Ino Givadamn yesterday, in 
private press conference con­
sisting only of himself, revealed 
to the student body the latest in 
fundraising efforts for the new 
university center.
“Estimating a student popula­
tion of approximately 6,000,” said 
Givadamn, “We have determined 
that fifty million dollars could 
easily be raised by jacking up 
tuition another eight thousand
bucks per student.” When asked 
how students were supposed to 
come up with the large sums of 
money needed to meet such an 
extreme increase Givadamn said, 
“See Financial Ade.”
Making a quick run to the local 
“BigBird” Supermarket, we found 
“Financial Ade” between “Lemon 
Ade” and “Apple Cider.” Mrs. 
Meno Give-you-none of the Fi­
nancial Ade department had this 
to say: “Due to the unusually large 
sums of money that we are deal­
ing with, it seems more than just
a slightly remote chance to me 
that most of the students who are 
going to be applyingfor some form 
offinancial assistance in the 1989- 
90 scholastic term will, in fact, 
have greater difficulty in receiv­
ing any sort of money grants that 
were offered to them in the 1989- 
89 term since we are talkingabout 
such large sums of money.”
We asked Mrs. Give-you-none 
if she had any advice for students 
who are currently filling out their 
Financial Ade papers. She said, 
“Forget it.”

How to get the American Wig Express now.
Ann Miller had a frightening brush with disaster. During 
the Broadway run of Sugar Babies, a stray board 
with a nail through it fell and struck Ann Miller on the head.
The wig she was wearing saved her life. 
If it weren’t for that wig we may have lost one of the 
bastions of American Musical Theatre. She bought that 
wig with her American Wig Express Card. You can feel 
the same security that Ann Miller feels at this very moment 
through the American Wig Express Card. 
Call 1-800-BIG-W1GS now and ask for 
a student application. It may save your life.

Don’t Buy Wigs Without It.

into the times when 
Carnage-Mellon still had a hyphen

Ann Miller gets an outstanding welcome virtually

for just about every wig you’ll ever want.

Dick
He’s a good guy, so get off his back
So, Dick’s been taking a lot of 
shit for the University Center 
Complex lately and we at The 
Natrat don’t think he should take 
it any more. You know, we were 
sittin’ around bullshittin’ about 
'Dick and we decided that he’s a 
good guy and everybody should 
get off his back!
Dick says he’s been trying to 
raise money for the Complex, and, 
well, that’s good enough for us. 
You just gotta believe him...he’s 
Dick, he wouldn’t lie. So get offhis 
back.
Speaking of this whole damn 
Complex thing, we think it’s being 
blown way out of proportion. Dick’s 
right: we’re trying to solve social 
problems with nothing but expen­
sive buildings. And that bites.
Let’s bag the Complex, take the 
$500,000 Dick has raised for the 
Center in the last three years and 
dig a big duck pond in the Cut. It’s 
the perfect solution:
•It’s cheap.
•We already have the money 
and the land.
• It’ll make football practice more 
fun for the players and more en­
tertaining for everyone else. For­
get about computer disks — ev­
eryone will want to see the team 
practice in a duck pond.
•It’ll give P-Plant cheap fertil­
izer. Think of the money the uni­
versity will save if it doesn’t have 
• to go out and buy the shit it spreads 
around every spring and fall. Raise 
a few hundred ducks on the Cut 
and we’ll never have under-fertil­
ized grass on campus again.
•It’ll offer a stress-free nature 
getaway right on campus. Plant a 
few trees around that puppy and 
it’ll be better than Schenely Park 
with much less crime.
•It fits into the “back to nature” 
Master plan with its colonades 
and ravine. To hell with this hi- 
tech image—let’s turn Computer 
U. into Nature U. After all, we are 
living in a kinder, gentler nation. 
We think this duck pond will go a 
long way to making this a kinder, 
gentler university.
•It’ll offer new traditions. In­
stead of the old, boring traditions 
like the Beaux Arts Ball we can 
start new traditions like duck 
hunting after finals, the nude 
water Olympics, and hydroplane 
buggies. (Wait a minute, does that 
mean that all the frats would have 
to have three and four blade buggy- 
boats? That could be a problem.)
•It’ll unite a fragmented stu­
dent body. Students of all colors 
will come together to feed the 
ducks—it’ll be grreeeeaaaatttttt!!
You know, Dick’s fundraising 
really bites because he has been 
selling a building. We understand 
how tough itis to raise $35 million 
for a damn building where a bunch 
of spoiled, whiningbrats canhang 
out.
To hell with that: Dick, we know 
you’re a good guy, we’re here to 
help you push this duck pond — 
our cure-all solution — into a 
reality. You can count on The 
Natrat, just like the students of 
Carnage Mellon have been able to 
count on you.
Edye: Clearly the best candidate
She’s articulate. She’s a local 
celebrity. She gives good speech. 
And, she’s blond. What more do 
we need in a president?
We are talking, of course, about 
WPXI anchor Edye Tarbox, the 
obvious choice to replace Carnage 
Mellon President Dick “Lame- 
duck” Cyrat.
As crack Natrat Inside Trader 
Russel Egg-man reported on page

the other candidates at seducing 
donors, getting Channel 11 on

Natrat reader needs to get a life, dammit
Dear Natrat Forum:
My name is Earl and I’m an engineer­
ing student at a predominantly male 
college in the northeast. I never thought 
I’d be writing to the Natrat Forum: I 
always thought those letters were fake. 
But now, I’m a believer!
I was sitting in computer architecture 
class the other morning, fixing myself a 
cup of coffee with creamand sugar, when 
a girl walked in and satin front of me. I 
couldn’t believe it! She was about 5’ 8” 
with combed red hair and a calculator 
that just wouldn’t quit! Just the sight of 
her made me spill cream on my jeans!
Utter to the Emperor
I couldn’t take my eyes off of her for the 
entire class. Towards the end, the pro­
fessor asked for a calculation that I, in 
my limited experience, could not per­
form. But...oh...she knew what to do! 
Her fingers ran up and down her calcu­
lator, pausing now and then to caress 
certain key areas. Soon, the pace picked 
up, and she started pushing furiously!
I was breathing heavily and hoped no 
one next to me noticed my growing ex­
citement. Finally, after wh at seemed like 
hours, the answer came in a gush of 
digits. She arched her back and raised 
her voice, letting the entire class know 
she had achieved an answer!
After that, class was over. Imetherfor 
a minute outside, and we shared a ciga­
rette to relax. Unfortunately, I never 
sawher again. Maybe she was a transfer 
student. I don’t know. I just hope I’ll be 
able to write to you again sometime.

campus more often, and causing 
annual applications to rise. On 
the other hand, her appointment 
would mean Della Cruz as news 
anchor, more drool, and “Carnage

Everybody has faults. We at The 
Natrat want Edye.
Just think about what she would 
do for quality of life! To hell with

We urge the trustees to appoint 
Edye president of Carnage Mel­

I would like to complain about the 
actions of a very, large humanoid­
shaped thing at last semester’s Air

ternity’s performance, he threatened 
me, saying, “Shut up or I’ll bash your 
head in.”
Sincerely,

Editor:
I would like to clarify a comment 
made in an earlier letter. I did not tell 
Mr. Limped-Wristed Wimp to “Shut 
up or I’ll bash your head in.” I said, 
“Shut your anal-retentive orifice be­
fore I rip your head off and shit down
your throat.”
Since his letter was printed, I have 
since done so. Flowersmay’be sent to the 
Cyrat Funeral Home.

Editor:
I sat next to Limped-Wristed Wimp at 
Air Band. Mr. Loud, muscular, and in 
jail did indeed say “Shut up or I’ll bash 
your head in.” By the way, the funeral 
was very nice, thanks to all who sent the 
flowers.
Just wanted to let you know.

Who cares, who said to whom! I can’t 
believe that you didn’t even run a pic­

Editor:
I have been disgusted by the new wave 
of post neo-social deconstructivism that 
hasbeen proliferatingon campus. Speak­
ing pejoritively, this radical movement 
has inspired quite an aestheticized, neo- 
classicist movement throughout the 
plethora of social discourse communities 
and hamlets surrounding our area that 
could very well endanger anti-Foucauldi- 
anistic ideologies (pronounced with a 
short “i,” mind you). The changing pat­
terns and attitudinal preferences of 
heterosexual monogamy have reflected 
this increasingly pervasive school of
thought. Being the primordial, anal re­
tentive, essentialist, pre-post Joycian, 
neo-conservative that I am, this move­
ment has induced me to consider the 
political, socioeconomic, transhistorical 
ramifications inherent in such a bla­
tantly antidisestablishmentarianistic- 
ally transformation of cognitive thought. 
By reiterating this emergent ideology 
(short “i,” remember), the intrinsic anxi­
eties that we embody are subject to a cos­
mological metamorphosis, one where the 
seemingly conducive dichotomous rela­
tionship with this ignominous ideology 
(don’t forget that short “i,”) could be
fatalistically nihilistic. I was recently 
interpolated by a post-Brechtian, 
Althusserian, anti-Freudian, humanist 
colleague who attempted to impart upon 
me ideas of Marxist reform. When I 
overcame the initial perplexity of this 
oxymoronic ideology (short “i,” please), I 
was entirely disturbed. The apolitical 
ramifications should be quite obvious to 
the educated reader of this dissertation. 
Please, just say no to Foucault. Huzz- 
Pejoritively,

The best way to end abortion is to kill women
Abortion is evil. Abortion kills babies. 
Abortion does not contribute one cent to

anyone off of welfare. And Medicaid pays 
for it...I think.

baseball?
Yknow, I was sitting down in 
Atlanta last week in the back of a 
pickup truck, chewing a wad of 
Red Man (chewing tobacky for 
those ofyou who don’t know) when 
I realized that baseball season 
begins this week.
Although I am now cursed with 
season tickets to watch the At­
lanta Braves, I am a great base­
ball fan, having lived in each of 
the 23 major league cities at some 
point in my life.
Truth is, I bought the tickets so 
I could see all the other teams 
play. I don’t care who wins, I just 
want to see the guy at first base 
split his pants while stretching 
for the throw from the third base­
man.
Baseball is the world’s greatest 
game because it is the thinking 
man’s game. Any idiot can throw 
a ball through a hoop or block a 
400poundlinebacker(infactyou’d 
almost have to be an idiot), but 
you really have to have some­
thing upstairs to get somebody to 
pay you $3 million to stand on a 
pitcher’s mound in skin tight 
pants when it’s ninety degrees 
outside and spit.
Of course, I am the world’s 
greatest expert on baseball be­
cause, hey, I’m the world’s great- 
est expert on everything from 
teddy bears to opera to fine tropi­
cal cocktails served in coconut 
shells. Therefore, I am proud to 
present my predictions for the 
1989 major league baseball sea­
son. (This one’s for you Bubby.)
•Most likely to wake up in a 
strange bed — This one’s a tie 
between Steve “Daddy Garvey 
and Wade “Thanks a lot, bitch”
Garvey may become the first 
man to win the quadruple crown; 
leading the league in batting 
average, home runs, RBI, and 
babies.
•Most likely to fight Mike Ty­
son between games of a double- 
header — Darryl “Bite me, Her­
nandez” Strawberry.
•Most likely to sell his kids to 
pay off his gambling debts—Pete 
“How the hell did they steal my 
gambling signals” Rose.
•Most likely to be sick of the 
word “token” by the end of the 
season — New National League 
President Bill “Black” White.
•Most likely to buy a bankrupt 
corporation—Pete “I’m outahere” 
Ueberoth.
•Most likely to say something 
really stupid—Bob “I ain’t pitch­
ing with no dames behind the 
plate” Knepper.
•Most likely not to wear a cup 
behind the plate — Pam “Twitch 
and it’s a balk, Bob” Postma.
•Most likely to become a pro­
fessional landscaper when he 
retires—Roger “The mound’s not 
good enough for me to pitch on” 
Clemens.
•Most likely to have hell freeze 
over before they meet in the 
American League playoffs again 
—The Chicago “We shouda gone 
to St. Pete” White Sox and the 
Baltimore “We weren’t really 
trying ’till May” Orioles.
•Most likely to have hell freeze 
over before they meet in the Na­
tional League playoffs again — 
The San Diego “To hell with base­
ball, let’s go lie on the beach” 
Padres and the Chicago “Maybe 
we’ll do better at night” Cubs.
Well, that’s all for the predic­
tions. See you at the ballpark. I’ll 
be the one making love in the 
outfield during batting practice. 
Everyone else screws around out 
there, why shouldn’t I?
Baby throw added to list of spurts at CMU
By CARING PAVLOV
Natrat Groupie
Hundreds of cheering spec­
tators lined the walls of the 
Skibop Ballroom at 3 am last 
Sunday for the First Annual 
Baby Throwing Contest.
The contest was sponsored 
by Students Underwriting 
Child Killers (SUCK), a newly 
formed group which fosters 
Multiple Sclerosis in healthy 
youngchildren who are toopoor 
to afford MS by any other 
means. All proceeds from the 
contest will benefit SUCK
One anxious parent partici­
pant claimed, “SUCKhas given 
me the chance to give my kids 
a disease they otherwise would 
have never been able to have.”
Families with small children 
from all around the Pittsburgh 
area came to Skibop for the 
event. Dozens of eager parents 
were given the long-awaited 
opportunity to vent their an­
ger on their incessantly scream­
ing brats.
According to Mary-Beth 
Whitehead, organizer of this 
year’s Throwing, “the time of 
the contest was selected in the 
hopes of extracting those terri­
fying, terrorizing screams from 
the children, and therefore 
pumpingup the adrenalin flow 
of the parents. We saw some
pretty incredible results this 
year, and we think the timing 
had a lot to do with it.”
Each throw was judged in the 
following categories: distance, 
height, time of flight, and vol­
ume of the child’s scream.
The volume category proved to 
be the deciding factor for this 
year’s winner, Johnny “Boo Boo” 
Smith, who scored an impressive 
96 out of 100 points. Smith came 
back from behind, after grazing 
the ceiling on his first throw and 
thus falling short in the distance 
category. The second throw by 
his parents sent him an incred­
ible 200 feet out and 25 feet up 
and kept him in the air for 12 
seconds. His screech shattered 
three windows.
Smith expressed his excite­
ment over the victory with a 
shreiking “Waa wahah waaah!!” 
His parents agreed and added a 
bit about their strategy. “It’s all 
in the windup,” explained Boo 
Boo’s dad.
“A strong windup and a well- 
timed release are the key," added 
Boo Boo’s mom, who fired up the 
winning throw.
Dr. John Hardup, Carnage 
Mellon’s new and improved ath­
letic director, is looking into the 
possibility of turning the contest 
into a school tradition and, ulti­
mately, into a sport, “just like 
buggy.”

addition to his vocal chords, gave Boo Boo the title.

Chugging 
club attains 
varsity status
By LEATHER N. LACE
Spurts "Wench
As his first action as Carnage 
Mellon’s athletic director, Dr. 
John Hardup held a press confer­
ence sometime last week while 
we were all in Florida, and an­
nounced that the chugging club 
will compete on the varsity level 
next year while baseball and 
hockey will continue as clubs.
“The primary reason for my 
decision is the affordability of fa­
cilities and equipment,” stated 
Hardup. “We cannotaffordtohave 
a baseball diamond or a hockey 
rink on campus, but the campus 
pub and the fraternity houses 
provide ample space for the chug- 
gers to practice and compete.”
Head Coach Bad Falters agrees. 
“With the addition of the Dick 
Cyrat Drinking Arena [formerly 
the Pant and Holler Inn], team 
members no longer have to prac­
tice on their own time or off cam­
pus. Besides, we’ve always had a 
good crowd on h and for our Thurs­
day night meets.”
The team will be competing in 
the Presidents’ Alcoholic Confer­
ence (PAC) and the University 
Alcoholic Association (UAA).
Chugging competition includes 
individual and relay events for 
the novice as well as the consum­
mate consumer. Points are 
awarded for the quickest, most 
creative way to drink beer, and in 
some events, the amount of beer 
consumed. Penalties are given for 
spillage and other wasteful ac­
tions.
Team captains Bud Wiser and 
I.. C. “Icy” Lite are looking for­
ward to competing on the varsity 
level.
“It will bring beer drinking to a 
hew height here at CMU,” said 
Wiser.
The team’s next home meet will 
be a three-day event held over 
Spring Carnival weekend in the 
fraternity quad against team 
alumni from 1974.
“It’s a great way to start our 
summer training,” said Lite.Foto Blooz win NCAA Basketball Title
Seton Hall stunned by winless UM minors team
By DAWN OF THE DEADLY
Natrat Detracting Editor
SPRAYN, Wash. — In a semi-upset last night, 
the Natrat’s UM minor division basketball team, 
the Foto Blooz, defeated the Pirates of Seton Hall 
107-11 to win the 1989 NCAA Division I basket­
ball tournament.
The Foto Blooz, winless in their regular UM 
season, replaced theUniversity of Michigan Wol­
verines when it was discovered that the entire 
team had an Underwater Basketweaving exam 
Monday afternoon.
“It’s a real shame that we had to pull out of the 
tournament, but Prop 48 forces the guys to be stu­
dents first,” said Michigan coach Bill Fisted.
While cutting down the team’s first ever cham­
pionship net, Foto Blooz manager Schecky Green 
exclaimed “I’m going to have to change my under­
wear.”
Starting guard, center, and forward ’Los “The 
White Michael Jordan” Franko scored 105 points 
for the Blooz.
“I — I mean I didn’t do it—it — it was a team 
effort—/know, I had a lot of support from every­
one,” he commented.
The Foto Blooz’ two remaining points were 
scored by His Royal Highness Napoleon Barn­
yard, affectionately known as “The Little Big 
Man” who did a reverse slam dunk over the head 
of Seton Hall star Ramone Ramos.
“It was a bitchin’ play. Oh man, it was great,” 
stated Barnyard. “He bent over to tie his shoe­
lace, so I stepped on his back, he stood up, and I 
put the ball through the hoop as I was flying 
though the air.”
Since nobody at CMU cares who scored the 
points for Seton Hall, we won’t bother with their 
names.
The Foto Blooz hope the championship will 
inspire them to new heights next season. “With 
some luck, we might actually win a regular sea­
son game next year.”

Natrat Narcotics Distributor
The community was stunned 
today by the announcement from 
the Carnage Mellon Trauma 
Department that for the next two 
years the Department will pres­
ent every play, television show 
and movie ever made.
The policy was developed by 
the office of President Cyrat in 
response to lagging ticket sales 
for the Department’s standard 
fare of musicals and straight 
plays. Cyrat’s office issued a state­
ment that says, “If they want a 
new 600-seat theatre that badly, 
then let them pay for it.”
Trauma Mistress Jizz Alla- 
round and Trauma Bootlicker 
Gone Straighttohelli could not be 
reached for comment, but the pair 
were observed running around the 
campus tearing their hair out and 
yelling.
Some problems with the new 
performance schedule have yet to 
be resolved, including the diffi­
culty of holding hourly perform­
ances of the 12,278-year long work 
in the Kwesge Slimepit. The pro­
posed ticket price of $3 million 
has also raised some eyebrows, 
although the usual half-price 
student tickets will be available.
If all goes as planned, the first 
performances will take place in 
June. Student actors are excited 
about the prospect of losing all 
their vacation time for the next 
two years while working on the 
project. Freshman actress Chas­
tity Innocence said, “This is the 
kind of artistic challenge I was 
hoping for when I beat out every­
body and his kid sister in the 
auditions.”

Wait — get a grip, okay? It’s just a joke, alright? 
Nobody’s actually saying that Meatloaf actually gave 
birth to all these guys. That would be really messy. He’d 
have to take time off fromhis touring schedule. Besides, 
I think Steven Wright and Elvis Costello are older than
Meatloaf. Absolutely 
no possibility whatso­
ever. No chance. 
Nope. Uh-huh, baby.

ceivable. Without 
merit in fact. Uh...

Still...
What if we’re just a 
little bitmisinformed, 
okay? What if. ..now, 
I know this sounds 
crazy, but...what if 
Meatloafis actually... 
no, it can’t be... well... 
What if Meatloaf is actually the illegitimate daughter of 
Elvis Costello and Steven Wright!! And the Affordable 
Floors are the godparents! Yeah! That’s it! That’s the 
ticket! I knew it all along! The resemblance — it’s 
absolutely unmistakeable! Yeah!

Below: Trauma Mistress Jizz Allaround and Trauma Bootlicker Gone Straighttohelli caught at an indelicate 
moment. The two were informed of the planned production of Everything right before the photo was taken.
It’s too bizarre to be true but according to 
all reports, it is. It’s just too unbelievable, too 
far out... I’m sorry. I just can’t quite grasp it 
myself. It’s too big. The implications are too 
enormous. If this pans out, we’ll all be million- 
ares — no, wait, that’s not right. Calm down.
Get a grip. Breathe. Okay. That’s much 
better.
No, I still can’t deal. This is just too weird, 
okay? I mean, thisi&amajor National Enquirer 
kind of thing. We can’t print this! We’ll get our 
butts sued off. Well all go to jail. WE’RE ALL

I’ve been the recipient of some 
interestingcards and letters these 
past few weeks. Seems that the 
general public is justaching to be 
enlightened about a thing or two. 
Seeing how it is spring and all, I 
figured now would be as good a 
time as any to respond to the top 
few Questions People Ask Joe 
Blob So As To Disturb Him From 
His Contemplation Of How To 
Get Wanda Bodine To Acciden­
tally Fall Into A Small Peat Bog 
In The Middle Of Nowhere And 
Never Ever Come Out Agin. Here 
we go.
Numero Uno: By far, the most 
asked question of the month has 
been;
Joe Blob, can you tell us what 
“aardvarking” really means?
Yes.
Lemme rephrase that: Joe Blob, 
do tell us what “aardvarking” 
means.
Oh, okay. Basically what we got 
here is your average everday 
euphemism, which is when Jack 
passes away, and you say, “Jack 
over there got his insides et away 
by rabid killer verminous cock­
roaches.” Or maybe the other way 
round. Anyway, “aardvarking” is 
also a prime example of onomato­
poeia, which is when the word is 
writ like the thing sounds, as in 
“Jack was kablooied.”
“Aardvarking,” used as a verb, 
refers to when two people, usu­
ally aman and a woman (although 
it has been known to occur be­
tween a man and a bimbo), make 
a sound like an aardvark. (This 
sound is almost but not totally 
unlike the sound of somebody 
stepping on wet sushi.) We’re 
talking the Beast with Two Backs. 
We’re talking an intimate rela­
tion here. We’re talking about 
fornication, if you know what I 
mean and I think you do. That is 
what “aardvarking” means. Just 
for your information.
Numero Does:
Joe Blob, what is the definition 
of“Fu?"
You’d be surprised how often 
this comes up. “Fu,” of course, is 
an ancient Japanese word mean­
ing “to use on someone.” There­
fore, the phrase “Chainsaw Fu”
More smarm & drivel
By WHEEZING KNICKER
Natrat Mindless Peon
Commercials. They’re every­
where. These mindless bits of 
capatalistic drivel just make my 
stomach turn, y’know?
The worst commercials, though, 
are the ones that make these 
ndiculous assumptions about the 
world. Have you seen the latest 
Dummynose Pizza ads? That 
annoying little gnome the Noydis 
8'tting at this big console calling 
down rain, snow and sleet on a 
less deliveryperson. Now 
feally. The disturbing thing about 
ad is that it implies that the 
weather is controlled by Clayma- 
¦*on characters. Of course every- 
¦)°dy knows that the weather is 
strolled by the Badmissions 
pfice. (Ever notice how every 
sleazy Bag Weekend dawns clear, 
bright, and 30 degrees above 
¦formal?)
Even worse are the Cloors Lite 
¡s featuring the combination 
lar and laundromat.” Oh pu- 
eeze. Ever try to do your wash 
Nhile sloshed on that dishwater 
¦hey call beer? Right-o, buckeroo. 
™at’s worse is that they show 
>11 these sexy collegians bringing 
heir clothes to this joint. Face it,
folks — hotbodies do not patron­
ize these places. When was the 
lasttimeyou saw sexually attrac­
tive people doing their wash in 
public?
And while we’re on the subject, 
don’t these whiny TV sitcoms 
drive you up the wall? I mean 
really. Not enough sex and vio­
lence for my taste, I’ll tell you. 
Censors suck, in my opinion. And 
reruns — they bite the big 
Kahuna, if you ask me. The desig­
nated hitter, the instant replay 
rule, the Oscars, passive men, 
nonrepresentational art, prime­
time news, genital warts, the 
attrition of organized religion, 
fanaticism, tainted grapes, free 
agents, kidney beans, poodles, 
New Jersey, fat women, body odor, 
Barbara Bush’s jewelery, Pete 
Rose, nerve damage, sullen intro­
verts, English majors, Stupid 
Senate, extra-large Slurpees, bad 
horror flicks, runaway elephants, 
loose cannons, bassoon playing, 
and jock itch—they all could just 
slip off the face of the earth and I 
wouldn’t mind a smidgen.
New in the video stores this 
week: Who cares?

little bozo who mouths off at the 
slightest opportunity.

becomes “Chainsaws are used on ing the $1.98 movie here.
some poor sucker.” Another popu­
lar phrase is “Breast Fu;” this 
quite naturally translates as 
“Breasts are used on some aw­
fully lucky fellow.” The one pri­
mary exception to this rule is 
“Aardvarking Fu.” It’s not what 
you might think; this translates 
as “Aardvarks are used on some 
dreadfully confused individual.” 
Believe me, this is almost worse 
than you can imagine.
Numero Trio:
Joe Blob, what is the secret of 
your incredible attractiveness to 
women1?
I think y’all are operating un­
der a slight misconception here. 
Tom Cruise is incredibly attrac­
tive to women. Robert Redford is 
incredibly attractive to women. 
Dustin Hoffman is cute. What I 
possess is an animal magnetism. 
Not the same thing at all.
And finally, Numero Quat- 
trones:
Joe Blob, where do babies come 
from?
See Numero Uno, folks. Those 
aardvarks are extremely busy 
little creatures, ain’t they?
Speaking of rutting animals 
with absolutely no common sense, 
I finally got the chance to see that 
all-time classic no-holds-barred 
all-action no-plot all-aardvarking 
extra-fu top-notch flick, Invasion 
of The Samurai Sluts from Hell. 
This is the kind of movie that can 
curdle milk at twenty paces.
The basic plotis that there isn’t 
one. For scenery, these folks have 
about three different stock interi­
ors (bar, office, bedroom), and to 
sustain the illusion of continuity, 
the “Meanwhile...” outside se­
quences are pictures of crayon 
drawings of buildings. We’re talk-
The characters never say any­
thing that sounds even remotely 
like real dialogue. At one point, 
the head Samurai Slut turns to 
the camera and mouths “I didn’t 
write this.” Ninety percent of the 
lines are grunts and squeals, if 
you know what I mean and I’m 
sure you do. If the actors aren’t 
acting dumb, they’re aardvark­
ing. Kinda like Sly and Brigitte.
There’s a magnificent sequence 
in the film lasting about ten 
minutes where the two guys and 
the two bimbos fight it out in total 
darkness. Just a series of shots of
people taking martial arts poses 
and jumping though the air. The 
absolute highestrefinementofthe 
art.
Ten breasts. Bimbo with a 
mustache. (75 points on the Vomit 
Meter.) No-contact karate. Aard­
varking. Really weird aardvark­
ing. Silly wigs. Explicit aardvark­
ing. Double bimbo scene. Breast 
pummeling. Opening credit that 
reads “A John T. Bone Sleazy 
Low-Budget Production.” Span- 
dex underwear. Set decoration by 
Crayola. Neon Fu. Breast Fu. 
Samurai Slut Fu. Kung Fu. 
Leather Fu. Wonton Fu. Over­
coat Fu. Double Breast Fu. Black- 
light Fu. Drive-In Academy 
Awards for the whole cast, every 
single one of them, for having 
absolutely no personal dignity or 
sense of decorum whatsoever, and 
to the director, John T. Bone, for 
doing a lot of hard drugs as a 
child.
Four stars.
Joe Blob says he had to change 
his underwear. Twice. Check it 
out.
If you’ve ever seen Surf Nazis Must Die, then you know that Adolf and 
Eva will be aardvarking in a matter of minutes.
Natrat editor attempts world’s record smallest headline
I must apologize for my recent 
outbursts here in my column, 
but I have found that my per­
sonal life has, on several occa­
sions, taken journalistic prece­
dence over the cultural life and 
musical times of Pittsburgh in 
general and CMU in particular. 
Today, however, I have resolved 
to adhere to matters of artistic 
merit and significance; that is, I 
won’t bore you with my indeci- 
sionabout whether to stayatCMU 
for graduate school or whether to 
follow Sam Jones, conducting 
guru at large, and one time CMU 
faculty member, back to Rice 
University in Texas. I won’t de­
scribe for you the agony of trying 
to choose between a free ride at 
CMU and artistic integrity. I am 
not going to mention that even 
though I am in-like-Flynn here, I 
really ought to strive for some- 
thingbetter. I don’t know, I mean, 
my girlfriend Cheryl, whom I met 
at CMU(do I owe the university 
some debt of ethereal gratitude 
for that?), goes to school in the 
South, so there would be that 
added bonus to Rice...I'm sorry. I 
wasn’t going to do this. I was 
going to discuss the Brandenburg 
Concert! and theirrecent perform­
ance in Alumni Concert Hall.
On the 24th of March, a great 
event in the life of the Music 
Department came to pass; the 
culmination of months of work. 
We gave a performance in the 
round ofall six ofthe Brandenburg 
Concerti, each conducted by a 
different member of the depart­
ment, except that two of them 
were conducted by me. I played 
the harpsichord for part of the 
evening also. It was a wonderful
Romantic
Introspection
Nectar
eveningfor everyone present. The 
delicate harmonies of the music 
were offset by the informal at­
mosphere and my piano teacher 
congratulated me on my efforts to 
pull the evening together, which I 
did almost singlehandedly. I 
mean, I don’t mean to complain 
but the Music Department didn’t 
even call the University Caterers
until that afternoon. How am I 
supposed to work with these 
people? I can’t stay here for two 
more years of this ....Oh, to hell 
with this, I am not here in your 
newspaper to discuss the finer 
points of musical performance, or 
to sing the praises of our rich 
cultural surroundings. I mean, a 
person needs a release around
here. There’s all this stress inher­
ent in the program (if you think 
ECE is tough, you should try 
playing the piano all day...no one 
gives us the credit we deserve.) 
And my roommate comes in at all 
hours, with peculiar men tagging 
along behind him. And I miss my 
girlfriend. And I need some sleep. 
And I need some new strings for 
the harpsichord in my room. I 
mean, the best thing that’s hap­
pened to me lately is that they 
lowered the ceiling on the VISA 
Card! I’m sorry, I can’t deal with 
the added pressure of writing this 
column this week. My senior re­
cital is coming up on Carnival 
Weekend and my piano teacher is 
breathing down my neck. I have 
to go practice. Artistic integrity 
and I will return next week.

New to the Rogues’ Gallery this 
week is an exhibit of munitions 
art by Lefty and Bud. The artists 
use surplus explosives and other 
weapons from Vietnam to sym­
bolize life and death and sex and 
hope and hopelessness and peace 
and war and baseball with an 
occasional religious symbol 
thrown in for good measure. Ac­
cording to Lefty, “Everything’s 
phallic.”
Lefty specializes in grenade 
painting in which he places a 
bucket of paint in the middle of a 
room and drops in a live grenade. 
He says that his technique was 
inspiredby an aftemoonhe spent
lying in a manure covered field 
watching bees fly from flower to 
flower. “The connection was so 
obvious,” Lefty said, “I can’t be­
lieve I never saw it before.”
Bud has spent the past three 
years working on a single piece, a 
blank canvas sprayed with M-16 
fire titled “Love.” Bud said that 
the piece was very difficult be­
cause the bullet holes had to be 
placed just right to symbolize the
eternal struggle 
of dog against 
mailman. It took 
Bud 120 square 
yards of canvas 
and 150,000 
rounds of ammu­
nition to create 
the final work.
In a similar creation, Bud 
slaughtered a young child on a 
light blue bedsheet as a protest 
piece against acid rain.
The munitions art show will be 
open 24 hours a day in the hopes 
that someone will actually come 
in who’s not looking for the near­
est computer cluster.

Best blubber in the South
By JUICY DELMONACO
Natrat Features Creature
“Hooray for the gold cup of sperm oil, 
my heroes.” [Herman Melville’s Moby 
Dick]
Amid frantic cries of “Thar she blows!” 
a group of exceedingly strange Carnage 
Mellon University students kicked off 
their annual Spermfest celebration this 
week. Spermfest heralds the glories of 
the sperm whale and the long-gone days 
of whaling in the United States. At best, 
participants are called strange by out­
siders; at worst, heartless blubber butch­
ers.
In what is perhaps the most demand­
ing week in the semester for these stu­
dents, the participants dress as and live 
the livesof theirfavorite characters from 
whaling mythology. Since living these 
persona includes frequent rolling in fish 
oil and infrequent bathing, the Spermfest 
participants have been banned from 
attending classes this year for the sake 
of public health.
Undaunted, however, the preparations 
go on as usual. Says senior Hugh Fisher, 
“[Spermfest] is just a chance for a couple 
of the guys to get together for a little 
harmless fun around something we all 
enjoy...
“I’m Captain Ahab. See, I lost my leg to 
this giant white whale, and I’ve been 
looking for him ever since so I can blast 
the [long, unprintable string of exple­
tives] out of the water ...
“ButweSpermfesters don’t take things 
too seriously. Like I said, it’s all in good 
clean firn.”
To further the verisimilitude of the 
festivities, the whalers cram into several 
rooms on the bottom floor of“sh ip-shaped” 
Hamerhead Hall, where they have ar­
ranged for continual deliveiy of the fresh­
est frozen whale blubber in the city. 
They read excerpts from such seafaring 
greats as Melville’s Moby Dick and 
Hemmingway’s The Old Man and the 
Sea and swap tall tales at midnight. All 
in all, “a man’s week," in the words of 
computer science student Brian “Poop 
Deck” Decker.
The climax of the week, however, is the 
whaling trip on the Monongehela sched­
uled each year with Scrimshaw Ship 
Rentals. Spermfest coordinator Lester 
Rheen hopes for a good trip this year, 
especially after the disaster last year in
which an innocent bystander, a mini­
ature poodle, on a near-by ship was 
harpooned to death by an overzealous 
Spermfester.
Spermfest is not without its contro­
versy, however. As they threatened after

The Natrat • Carnage Mellon • 4 April 198911
Alcohol Patrol to review 
student detainments
By SHERLOCKIA JONES
Natrat Security Liaison
The Alcohol Patrol announced 
today its proposed pi an to further 
insure the safety of Carnage 
Mellon University students. It is
plan that has met with heated 
controversy within both the stu­
dent body and the administra­
tion.
In order to cease unnecessary 
detainment of Carnage Mellon 
students, the patrol iscallingfor 
mandatory tattooing of not only 
all current students but also all 
incoming freshmen and transfer 
students. They suggested plant­
ing a large “CMU” on everyone’s 
forehead. Naturally, then, cam­
pus alcohol patrol officers could 
discriminate, on inspection, stu­
dents from non-students and 
therefore know when they should 
stop someone wandering around 
the campus. Alumni would sport 
a giant strike mark through the
“CMU,” but would by this mark 
still be identifiable.
Opponents protest that anyone 
can have “CMU” tattooed on his 
or her forehead to baffle this plan. 
To this the patrol initially re­
sponded that a special low-level 
radioactive dye could be employed 
as the tattoo ingredient and all 
officers could carry around mini­
ature Geiger counters to separate 
the real students from the would- 
be criminals. After receiving sev­
eral threatening letters from the 
Coalition for University Rights, 
however, the patrol revised its 
position and suggested develop­
ing a secret CMU handshake for 
final confirmation. Officials are 
now meeting with the Greek 
Counsil to discuss the possibili­
ties.
When asked to comment on the 
recent proposals, President-On- 
The-Way-Out Dick Gyrat re­
sponded, “Thank God this is 
someone else’s problem!”
Alcohol Patrol Officers Dick Racy and Dudley Doogooder heatedly 
discuss secret handshakes versus madatory tattooing as solutions to 
the “suspicious person” dilemma on campus. Officer Rock Pounder 
looks on.

Campus terrorism: What are they after?
ByE. BEAVER PETERS
Natrat Pencil Pusher
Terrorist organizations, the 
hallmark of the violent Middle 
East, are now beginning to 
stamp on Carnage Mellon 
University. They are appear­
ing at an alarming rate in the 
present day. One such organi­
zation, The People’s Front of 
McKeesport (the PFM) invited 
me along on an afternoon’s ter­
roristic activities.
“Our purpose,” said Izzy “Mo- 
hammud” Finklestein, PFM 
leader and spiritual Czar, “is to 
educate the poor ignorant slobs 
at CMU about the problems 
and culture of McKeesport.” 
The PFM believes that only 
through violent acts can their 
goals of higher purpose be re­
alized.
The PFM’s first act of 
McKeesport Nationalism was 
to seize a local man’s laundry 
in protest of the new toad-sex- 
ing regulations passed by the 
imperialistic oppressors cf 
McKeesport. Later they took 
me to a cluster to witness them 
taking over all the free ma­
in recent years Carnage Mellon 
University has faced an 
increasingly more serious 
terrorist problem. Between the 
PFM, the Oreo jihad, and Crazy 
Ahmed’s Appolectic Avengers, 
terrorist groups have caused 
much damage and have even 
swayed many impressionable 
young CMU minds to their 
bloodthirsty ranks. The Alcohol 
Patrol is baffled in the face of 
this menace and plans to appeal 
to the National Guardians for 
help.
chines. “Forcing the students 
away from the computers will 
make them think about the an­
cient indians who once roamed 
free on the plains of McKeesport!” 
claimed enthusiastic fellow ter­
rorist Shirly Mashoshoinnii.
“These pathetic students must 
learn of the 10 percent student 
discount at the McKeesport K- 
Mart!” ranted part-time terrorist 
Raul “Sweatsock” Machismo as 
the small group of infiltrators set 
off all available Morewood fire 
alarms.
I was forced to watch the group 
in the beginning of the year eras­
ing the silhouette at the bottom of 
Architech’sleap. Destroying such 
a great old tradition is something 
only a band of heartless terrorists 
would do. They had planned to 
replace it with slogans such as, 
“Down with Freshman English!”, 
“Please pass the salt!”, and “Dean 
Fienburg has no nipples!” How­
ever, they were interrupted by 
liquid nitrogen bombs and have­
n’t been back since.
I was also privileged to witness 
an attempt by the PFM to destroy 
the fence with paint remover. The 
PFM gave no motive for their
actions; it was merely an act of 
senseless violence.
The PFM has also been re­
sponsible for the frequent 
breakdowns of the Mac ma­
chine in Skibo. “If these stu­
dents don’t spend their money 
in McKeesport, they don’t de­
serve to spend it at all!” 
screamed Finklestein. The 
PFM is on campus in force. 
They promised we would see 
more of the PFM in the future. 
Until then, keep a close watch 
on your laundry.
The PFM has competition 
from at least two other terror­
ist organizations at CMU: The 
Oreo Jihad and Crazy Ahmed’s 
Appoletic [sic] Avengers. I was 
unable to get an interview with 
the Oreo Jihad, but I was as­
sured they would be in contact 
with me. Crazy Ahmed’s fol­
lowers are now holed up in the 
basement of Doherty Hall, 
threatening to blow up the 
building with paint fumes from 
several open design studios.
The Alcohol Patrol was too 
busy meeting with the Greek 
Counsil to discuss secrethand- 
shakes to make a comment.

Natrat Asst. Features Creature
Last Thursday night, the first 
of a soon-to-be annual Geek Sing 
was held, with proceeds, which 
went well over two hundred dol­
lars, to go to research for the de- 
velopement of new and improved 
technology for the Android sys­
tem.
The night's entertainment 
started out with a number in the 
group competition. The Grey 
Matter Geeks performed their in­
terpretation of The Sound of 
Music. Unfortunately, the only 
thing that they brought down with 
their performance was the cur­
tain. This accident happened 
when one of The Grey Matter 
Geeks got tangled up in the cur­
tain and, in a moment of abject 
terror, ran off to the nearest per­
sonal computer.
After the AB crew repaired the 
curtain, the show continued. Next 
up was an independant group call­
ing themselves, Girls Can Be 
Geeks, Too. This group preformed 
Annie, which touched some people 
so deeply that some of them actu­
ally applauded. The female geeks’ 
show ended with Annie, played 
by Rotting Bananahead, singing 
Tomorrow. Doctors say that 
Bananahead’s voice will be fine in 
just a couple of weeks, which is 
much more than I can say for my 
ears.
The third group to perform cap­
tured first place with its musical 
interpretation of Advanced Dun­
geons and Dragons. Their show 
concluded with a warrior victori­
ously battling a dragon. How ex­
citing.
As to what they are going to do 
with the prize money, Eugene 
Fudpucker replied, “Buy some

Elmer Grossian, individual winner in the first Geek Sing competition,

shampoo and wash my hair.” After 
this comment, the rest of the group 
broke up into-fits of hysterical 
laughter. Finally, their group 
stoppped laughing and Eugene 
responded seriously to the ques­
tion, “We are going to buy the 
newest software packages for our 
computers.” For the next seven 
hours this loyal reporter listened 
patiently to the differences be­
tween the ten best personal com­
puters.
The next category up was for 
the solo performers. The first 
entry in this category was Melvin 
Poindexter. Melvin sung several 
cartoon themes such as Scooby 
Doo and The Jetsoris. He also 
came on stage dressed in a Scooby 
Doo costume. The only good thing 
about his act was that it ended.
Next up was Andrew The 
Worm’ Klonowski. He brought
his clarinet out and played three 
different Sousa marches. His 
playing was fine but I don’t think 
that Sousa meant for any of his 
pieces to be played as clarinet 
solos. After his act, I managed to 
talk with Andrew. I asked him 
how he felt about his perform­
ance. His response, “I think I did 
a good job, but I really don’t care 
if I’ve won or not. I’m just happy 
to be named after the best com­
puter system in the world.” 
Last but not least was the 
winner in the solo category. 
Elmer Grossian Ill’s act was 
unlike all the others. His act 
consisted of conductingan imagi­
nary orchestra through various 
pieces. After his first place vic­
tory, Elmer explained how he 
won, “That’s easy. I’m the only 
one who did not sing. I had to 
win.”
