PLAID IS OUT 
FOR REYENGE

VtiiCaCu
This Saturday night at the gym­
nasium, one of the best contested 
basketball games of the season is 
expected to take place. Carnegie will 
meet the fast going Allegheny Col­
lege five and judging from the game 
our boys have been putting up, a red- 
hot contest is expected. Allegheny 
has always been noted for her basket­
ball teams and this year’s is no excep­
tion to the rule. Her previous teams 
have beaten Yale, Syracuse, Pennsyl­
vania and teams of that caliber, while 
this year’s five have trimmed Niagara, 
Rochester, Ohio Wesleyan, and Grove 
City and as yet have not been defeat­
ed. They play Pitt on Friday night, 
so that it will give our boys a chance 
to see what they can expect in Satur­
day’s game.
Our boys have been going rather 
strong lately. The last two home 
games have resulted in victories for us 
and by good scores. We have demon­
strated that we have a good scoring 
combination and that we can play good 
basketball. It takes a mighty good 
team to beat either Gettysburg or 
Westinghouse. Gettysburg showed a 
strong combination (they beat Le­
high, 45 to 22 last Saturday, after Le­
high had beaten Pitt two nights pre­
vious) and we beat Gettysburg, and 
not because they played poorly but 
because we played extremely well. 
They played the same game against 
us that made the Pitt rooters feel their 
team was in for a sure defeat when

“Mi BUSINESS IS TO DO AS MUCH HOOD III 
IDE WORLD AS I (AH,” I SAYS
(From New York Herald.)
Mr. Carnegie was escorted to the 
witness stand directly after the com­
mission began its afternoon session, 
at ten minutes past two o’clock. Wide­
spread publicity given to his expected 
appearance had crowded the room to 
its capacity with an eager audience, 
a large proportion of which was com­
posed of socialists, single taxers and 
followers of the I. W. W. propaganda. 
Mr. Carnegie,” said Mr. Walsh affa- 
ably, as he mounted the dais. “Take the 
chair. The Laird of Skibo did so, and 
for a moment he scanned the faces of 
his audience, seated in close rows on 
the floor of the chamber, rather than 
those of his inquisitors. As the chair­
man framed his first streotyped ques­
tion, “What is your name?” Mr. Car­
negie rose and stood, leaning slightly 
forward, with his hands clasped to­
gether on the table.

“Of course there is no objection to 
your standing, if you prefer to do so, 
Mr. Carnegie,” said the chairman, 
courteously.
“I do prefer to stand,” said Mr. Car­
negie. “I am more accustomed to 
stand while talking, though I am no 
great orator.”
oc,ience .ot Won setu
Here the witness for the first time 
turned upon his auditors that magne­
tic smile which has made him famous. 
The socialists and the disciples of all 
the “isms” did not smile back. He 
had not yet won them. They were 
studying him with knitted brows, as 
entomologists might study some new 
species with which they had been 
brought into close contact for the first 
time. Clearly, Mr. Carnegie’s aud­
ience was not much in sympathy with 
him—not yet.
“What is your business?” asked Mr. 
Walsh.
“My business is to do as much good
in the world as I can; I have retired 
from all other business.”
The witness then said that, at the 
request of the commission, he had 
tried to reply to the questions they 
had sent to him, and, with their per­
mission, he would read his statement. 
Mr. Carnegie began to read in a clear 
tone, in which occasionally there was 
a quaver. He stood erect, holding his 
manuscript in the left hand, while he 
frequently used the right with which 
to score a forcible gesture, bringing 
down his closed first vigorously upon 
the small oak table in front of him 
when he wished to be especially em­
phatic.
Often he turned about and directly 
faced the throng who sat listening 
from the floor. Then, in some transi­
tion of thought, he would swing about 
and address himself to the semi-circle 
of inquisitors, whose eyes, for the 
most part, seemed to be riveted upon 
the ironmaster with a sort of tolerant 
curiosity.
nhu VPhnegie’y gtPtementu
Mr. Carnegie’s prepared statement, 
which bristled with anecdote and 
sparkled with humor, follows:—
“Mr. Chairman:—I have read with 
deep interest the testimony given be­
fore you by many millionaires, Messrs. 
Schiff, Belmont, Guggenheim, Per­
kins, Gary, and notably Miss Tarbell, 
who, though not a millionaire, cer­
tainly deserves to be; she seems to 
have a firm grasp upon the problem 
and proves herself one who studies 
the question and rightly appreciates 
the great progress made during her 
time. I agree with her statement, 
‘Sane publicity is the cure for most 
evils in American industrial life.’
“Last, but not least, the testimony 
on Friday of that unaccountable being, 
Henry Ford, who declares that he 
could make every convict in Sing Sing 
a competent, trustworthy laborer in 
the vineyard, I am not disposed to 
question anything that this prodigy 
asserts. Success to him! By all means 
let us give him a trial. His success 
here would be no more of a seeming 
miracle than his success with the Ford 
car.
“I never bought or sold shares on 
the Exchange; all my earnings were 
from manufacturing. If it were neces­
sary for me to return to that calling I 
should not consider the problem of 
labor as at all difficult. On the con-

Al WAGNER III 
CHARGE Of IEAM
‘It.Ug” et oVe og Frlge 
irCUeC.o.eu
Last Saturday, Carnegie’s basket­
ball team made its first appearance 
since the Wagners have taken charge. 
Al. Wagner and his more renowned 
brother “Honus” have had exclusive 
control since the Gettysburg game 
and they have been working hard and 
earnestly to whip our team into a 
winning five. It is quite too early to 
say what the new coach has accom­
plished because his system has not as 
yet been put to a fair test.
Al. Wagner, the new coach, is prob­
ably known more for his baseball abil­
ity than for his basketball accom­
plishments. He was a big league ball 
player some twenty years ago and it 
is said if there had been no Al., the 
world would never have known the 
wonderful “Honus,” because it was 
through the former’s influence that 
the famous shortstop- was prevailed 
upon to enter the national pastime. 
Al has had some experience in ama­
teur and semi-professional basketball 
but has never played the college game. 
He understands all the rudiments and 
should make a good coach. “Honus” 
has been assisting him lately and will 
continue to do so until March 6th, 
when the Pittsburgh Pirates depart 
for their spring training trip. The 
“German fleet” has become a prime 
favorite with the boys and all the men 
seem willing to work hard for him. 
The Wagners have our best wishes 
for a successful team.
While the new coach is entering 
upon his task with so much praise and 
glory, it is altogether fitting and 
proper that we say something about 
the man who is retiring, viz., Dr. 
Marks. “Doc” was forced to leave in 
a rather unfortunate period or when 
the team was in a losing streak. His 
other duties as resident physician 
were so pressing that the authorities 
deemed it necessary to relieve him of 
his athletic connections with all our 
teams. “Doc” was loathe to resign 
at that period and honestly expressed 
his opinion that the team would come 
around and win, as it has done. In 
justice to Dr. Marks, it must be said 
and said emphatically that he did not 
quit under fire. He is too big a man, 
and anybody that knows him will 
vouch for his good faith. He has giv­
en his services most cheerfully and 
without one single penny of remuner­
ation. Those who have worked under 
him can most appreciate his value as 
an earnest and conscientious teacher.

PITTSBURGH, PA., FEB. 11, 1915
Vol.Caro.g Ftl Vol.CarCu
Although delayed, our greetings to 
the new basket ball coaches are none 
the less cordial and sincere. A num­
ber of years ago, Andrew Carnegie 
founded, near Pittsburgh, the town 
which bears his name. In the course 
of time this town of Carnegie pro­
duced a pair of athletes whose prowess 
on the basketball floor and baseball 
field brought fame to their native vil­
lage. Now these two brothers, John 
(Honus) and Albert Wagner, have 
come to another kind of institution, 
founded by the same Andrew Car­
negie, for the sole purpose of plac­
ing that Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology on the intercollegiate basket 
ball and baseball maps. Their repu­
tations having preceded them, the 
Wagners need no introduction to the 
student body. The result of the first 
game under their tutelage gives us 
the greatest confidence in their teach­
ing ability.
FloeCl.res tF PtirerVgu
When the political reformer of to­
day attempts to offer a remedy for 
the corrupt condition of our city, 
state, or federal government, he fre­
quently points to the young educated 
classes as the hope for the future. 
With the increasing enrollments in 
the colleges and universities of the 
country and with the consequent in­
crease in the number of educated men, 
that hope might seem very bright, un­
til certain practices of the college un­
dergraduate are investigated. Then 
grave doubt arises whether the mod­
ern student will not aid rather than 
hinder political corruption.
One of the most popular political 
evils is grafting, consisting not only 
of financial bribery, but also of the 
exchange of favors among the de­
graded few who profit at the expense 
of the masses. This fault is too often 
evident in a modified form in many 
of the higher institutions of learning 
throughout the country. And Car­
negie is no exception to the rule. The 
beginning of another semester seems 
a fitting time to criticize and to dis­
close a practice which is exerting a 
harmful influence on the student life 
at Tech by the introduction of unde­
sirable political methods into the class 
and other school elections. The prac­
tice to which we refer is that of fra­
ternity politics—politics not in the 
dictionary sense of the science of 
government, but in the popular inter­
pretation of the science of grafting. 
The sort of grafting against which 
we inveigh is that of promising re­
wards such as appointments on com­
mittees, in return for votes. Some of 
the fraternities have in the past ap­
parently resorted to this “spoils” sys­
tem to insure the election of their 
own members. There was a time, and 
we hope there will soon again come 
the time when the election to a class 
office will be considered an honor, 
for every position loses its dignity 
when gained by the present methods 
of campaigning and caucusing. That 
the members of one fraternity should 
support for election their own brother 
may be understood, but that one fra­
ternity should barter and exchange 
votes with another fraternity in the 
effort, as is foolishly thought, to gain 
control over, or in a certain class, is 
beyond our comprehension. We have 
in mind a specific though unsuccess­
ful instance which occurred in one of 
the Senior class elections last fall, 
and we have good reason to believe 
this is not the only class in school 
guilty of a similar offense.
What can be the purpose of such 
methods? Surely the office-seeking 
individuals whether successful or not, 
must lose their self-respect, the con­
trol-seeking fraternity certainly low­
ers itself in the estimation of the 
other fraternities and students. Then 
why not eliminate the practice at Car­
negie? There is no better time to 
begin to do so than the present. In 
the class elections for the second se­
mester to be held shortly, let us for­
get party and fraternity lines and vote 
for the most competent officials. If 
the members of fraternities feel obli­
gated to support their own brothers, 
at least let them make no illegal at­
tempts to influence others in their se­
lections of candidates. When an offi­
cer will be thus elected he may con­
sider himself duly honored and in turn 
he should deem it his privilege to 
serve his fellows. Under these cir­
cumstances, the undergraduates of 
Carnegie will receive the training 
which will aid them to perform their 
duties as respectable and respected 
citizens of this country and to fulfill 
the hopes of the optimistic reformers.
PLAID OUT FOR REVENGE
Continued from Page 1
those two teams met. Another fea­
ture well worth comment is the fact 
that we discovered a foul shooter ly­
ing around who was waiting to be 
used. Levy’s record of ten our of 
eleven chances is a good one and it is 
hoped that he will be able to keep 
up the average set by his first trial 
from the foul line.
Another thing is that the Plaid will 
be out to avenge a previous defeat 
administered by the Methodists. Last 
year Allegheny gave us the worst 
drubbing a Tech team has ever re­
ceived. Our boys will be out to wipe 
out this defeat if it is in any way pos­
sible.
Under these conditions, it is not 
stretching matters too far to say that 
we have hope of a victory if the team 
can duplicate its last two perform­
ances, and there is every reason to be­
lieve that it can. So don’t forget and 
come out Saturday and help the team 
along. They need the encouragement. 
The band, which made such an aus­
picious showing last week at the game 
will be present again to liven up the 
affair. A dance w’ill follow the con­
test and a preliminary starting at 7:30 
between Tech Plebes and East Lib­
erty Academy, will precede the big 
game. Remember now, Saturday, Al­
legheny versus Tech in a real basket­
ball game. Talk up the game, fel­
lows, for we can gain a good deal of 
outside credit if we are able to beat 
the wonderful Allegheny team. Work 
up a little spirit and come out and 
root for the home team. Carnegie 
students can feel sure that Allegheny 
turns out to the man to support her 
team and that spirit has gone a long 
way to make her a great team. Imag­
ine it, Allegheny has been beaten but 
once on her home floor in twelve 
years. That speaks pretty well for 
her home support. Let’s show a lit­
tle of that pep., fellows. Let’s make 
our boys win that game.
AL WAGNER IN CHARGE

Two men on the present Varsity team 
owe practically all their basketball 
knowledge to “Doc’s” teachings. Dr. 
Marks is owed much credit for what 
he has done to develop our basketball 
team. His spirit and ideals were al­
ways of the highest and he truly re­
minds us of the expression: “He was 
a man and I shall not look upon his 
like again.” While the team welcomes 
the Wagners, it surely feels the loss of 
such a teacher and friend as Dr. 
Marks.

Active training for the coming track 
season has begun. With the first call 
for indoor men last Monday, the train­
ing season was formally opened and 
quite a few men are reporting at the 
gym. There are several indoor meets 
to be held hereabouts in which Tech 
will enter teams. So it behooves thore 
who have any track aspirations what­
ever to get out and commence actual 
training. Coach Dull will be at the 
gym every day after 4:30 to meet any 
men that have any track inclinations. 
We should have a large sized squa^1 
one of about fifty or seventy-five men. 
Track is one of the most healthful of 
our Varsity sports and requires the 
\east natural ability. Any man tha«. 
will come out and train and work ePhn­
estly is bound to make good in time. 
Furthermore, track requires the least 
of a man’s time because it is all in­
dividual work and not team play. A 
fellow can come out and do his little 
turn at any time of the day regard­
less of whether the other fellow is 
there to fill out the team. Now here 
is your chance, men, to take a little 
exercise that will put you in trim con­
dition to wrestle with your mental 
tasks. We want all the men out that 
we are possibly able to get, the more 
the merrier. This especially applies 
to the new men in school. Go over 
and meet Coach Dull and talk track 
with him. You will find him a mighty 
fine fellow, and one well worth having 
as an acquaintance.
There are two meets which Tech is 
naturally looking forward to at this 
time. The one is the indoor meet of 
March 13th, when a Tech quartet will 
oppose the Pitt relay team and the 
other is the Penn relays to be held in 
April. These are two events well 
worth preparing for. Their import­
ance cannot be emphasized too great­
ly. In order for us to accomplish 
anything, we must start to prepare and 
now is the time. Don’t put it off, 
fellows, but get out to the gym and 
start working. Any day at 4:30. 
Quarter-milers are especially needed 
for our relay team.

CARNEGIE BEFORE COMMISSION
Continued from Page 1
trary, I enjoyed conferences with our 
men. We had one rule—come what 
may, we would never think of running 
our works with new men. Able, sober, 
well behaved workmen such as ours 
were are not to be picked up on the 
streets, and we wished no others. We 
were very particular in regard to 
drinking—I am a total abstainer my­
self. First offense, men were excluded 
thirty days; second offense, sixty 
days; third offense, we parted com­
pany.
“We only had one serious disaster 
with labor," but that was terrible, in­
deed. I was coaching through the 
Scottish Highlands on my holiday and 
did not hear of the lamentable riot at 
Homestead until days after it oc­
curred. I wired at once that I would 
take the first steamer home, but was 
requested not to come. My chief 
partner, Mr. Phipps, in a letter to the 
New York Herald, January 31, 1904, 
explains it as follows:—
“‘Question:—It was stated that Mr. 
Carnegie acted in a cowardly manner 
in not returning to America from 
Scotland and being present when the 
strike was in progress at Homestead?’ 
Qcotey fhom tTe IehPl,u 
“‘Answer by Mr. Phipps:—When 
Mr. Carnegie heard of the truoble at 
Homestead he immediately wired that 
he would take the first ship for Amer­
ica, but his partners begged him not 
to appear, as they were of the opinion 
that the welfare of the company re­
quired that he would not be in this 
country at the time. Now mark this: 
—They all knew his extreme disposi­
tion to always grant the demands of 
labor, however unreasonable. I have 
never known of any one interested in 
the business to make any complaint 
about Mr. Carnegie’s absence at that 
time, but all partners rejoiced that 
they were permitted to manage the 
affair in their own way.’ ”
As Mr. Carnegie said, “Mark this,” 
and then read his quotation from the 
Herald" fie brought down his fist 
strongly. Every sign of weakness had 
now vanished from his delivery, as 
he went on:—-
“gome of tTe men Pt tTe wohky 
cPble, mev ‘Kin, nPytehv tell cy 
wTPt boc wPnt cy to ,o Pn, we 
will ,o it foh bocu’ rt wPy too 
lPteu”
As he spoke the words, “to late,” 
the ironmaster’s voice sank to a tragic 
whisper, and he continued:—“I sup­
posed from Mr. Phipps’ cable that all 
was settled and decided it best to con­
form to my partners’ wishes. My 
partners made a most generous offer 
to the workmen. The new Homestead 
rolling mills increased product sixty 
per cent over the old. The rollers 
were offered thirty per cent advance 
in wages, one-half of the total gain. 
I would not have done more.
“The error was in trying to start 
with new men, against our rule. But 
here again, I understand, the Gov­
ernor of the State, with troops at 
Pittsburgh, wished the law vindicated. 
With this exception we never had a 
grave disaster.
“One or two partners out of our
forty may, as Mr. Phipps states, some­
times consider me foolish ‘in always 
yielding to labor,’ while I am satis­
fied that for every dollar so spent we 
had indirectly ample and more than 
ample reward. Frankly I consider 
that folly was one of my best virtues.
‘‘Ihe workmen that we had, sober, 
well behaving men as they were and 
are today, are the most profitable of 
all, and many of them rose to per­
manent, high salaries, and not a few 
to partnership, of which we had not 
less than forty odd, who are organ­
ized today as the Carnegie Veterans 
and dine once a year in our home. 
They come from all parts of the land.
IomeyteP, gthike rnci,entu
“You might like to hear the follow­
ing incident connected with the Home­
stead strike:—
“The Governor of Pennsylvania I 
understand wished certain of our 
workers arrested for riot and bound 
over for trial. Consequently, some of 
these disappeared, among them the 
Burgess of Homestead. Some time 
afterward my friend, Professor Van 
Dyke, of Rutgers College, was ordered 
to California for his health. Upon his 
return he told me that he had met the 
ex-Burgess working as a laborer in a 
Mexican mine at Sonora. I asked him 
to offer McLuckie any help he might 
need, and upon his return to the West 
he did so.
“Meanwhile, McLuckie had got a 
position with the Sonora Railway, 
driving wells, and was succeeding ad­
mirably.

ylowv ePhneyt heyponye: — ‘eTPt

As the witness quoted this eulogy 
his features relaxed in a beaming 
smile and his eyes twinkled as he 
added:—“Those were words which I 
cherish. When I heard this I sug­
gested to my friend Van Dyke that 
it wouldn’t be a bad epitaph to grace 
one’s tombstone. If it ever did I hoped 
there would be no long blank between 
the d’s. Each letter should be put 
down to give McLuckie’s proper ex­
pression.
“When I talked to the Homestead 
rollers upon my return I told them 
my partners had offered liberal terms 
and I could not have offered more. 
One roller said:—‘Oh, Mr. Carnegie, 
it wasn’t a question of dollars! The 
boys would have let you kick them, 
and they wouldn’t let another man 
stroke their hair.’
“May I trouble you with one ex­
ample of the working of our system? 
Upon one of my visits to Pittsburgh 
I met the men who wished a confer­
ence. They asked that payments be 
made every two weeks instead of 
monthly, as the Pennsylvania Railroad 
employes were then paid.
“One named ‘Johnny’ Edwards, a 
clever workman and fine fellow, rose 
to state their case. He said that if 
they were paid semi-monthly it would 
be equal to a raise in their wages. He 
and his wife visited Pittsburgh the last 
Saturday in each month and bought 
a full month’s food supply, thereby

thereafter, and so it was.
“Then Edwards said:—‘There is an­
other unfair charge. The coal dealers 
here charge almost double for coal 
in small quantities.’
VoPl Pt WToleyPleu
“‘Indeed!’ I said. ‘Hereafter our 
workmen get their coal at the exact 
wholesale cost to us—not one cent 
of profit.’
“ ‘And,’ said Edwards, ‘we don’t 
want to be too troublesome, but every­
thing we buy here is far dearer than 
in Pittsburgh.’ ‘Well,’ I replied, ‘why 
not start a shop of your own. Rent 
one in Main street, and we shall pay 
the rent, organize and run it and 
charge our workmen just enough to 
pay your way.’ And this was done, 
but, sorry to say, the shop did not 
prove successful, as retailers reduced 
prices. A victory!
“You have here an illustration of the 
disadvantages workmen are often com­
pelled to bear. There was another 
feature. We offered our men six per 
cent upon all the savings left with us, 
payable on demand. And here let me 
congratulate Judge Gary and his 
board upon the greatest step yet tak­
en. When workmen were made share­
holders they were sold shares in the 
company upon a very liberal basis and 
guarded against loss.

Friday night, February the fifth, the 
class of 1916 gave its Junior Prom in 
the Recreation Hall of M. M. C. S. 
It was a most brilliant affair and 
showed that the Juniors can, when the 
occasion demands, do wonderful 
things. It wasr conducted, owing to 
wise management, very economically, 
and the money which otherwise might 
have been given to caterers and dec­
orators v^as used for materials, be­
cause the'girls themselves were will­
ing to work.
Following the custom of preceding 
classes, the Faculty and Seniors were 
the guests of the Juniors. In the re­
ceiving line were Miss Grace Sea- 
right, president of the class, Dean 
Breed, Miss Belleville, honorary mem­
ber of the Junior class, Miss Lyon, 
Miss Hinman, Miss Merrill, and Miss 
Dickey, Senior president.
The hall was profusely decorated 
with Southern smilax and hundreds of 
paper flowers. The smilax reached 
from light to light across the ceiling, 
in squares and diagonals, from which 
hung long stemmed poppies of un­
equal lengths. Smilax also covered 
the square pillars, while palms and 
potted plants formed an effective 
screen for the orchestra. The third 
floor corridor and hall was attractive­
ly furnished with willow chairs, rugs 
and cushions, providing both a com­
fortable and charming place to sit out 
dances, while shades on the electric 
lights cast a soft glow over the whole 
scene. In the dining room, small card 
tables were arranged for those who 
did not care to dance.
The programs carried out further 
the class colors of black and gold. 
Leather picture frames lined in yellow 
were for the men, while the girls re­
ceived card cases lined in the same 
color.
Supper was served at eleven-thirty 
in the Lunch Room, which looked 
quite festive and entirely different 
from its daily appearance. As one 
entered the room it presented a most 
attractive and charming scene. The 
counter was removed and the tables 
were arranged around the room. In
the center of each table was a basket 
filled with daffodils and fern; a yellow 
ribbon was tied on each handle. The 
only light was from the candles which 
had yellow shades, two being placed 
on each table. At every place was an 
orange basket filled with fruit salad 
and topped with a cherry. Sandwich­
es, cut in fancy shapes, and olives, 
completed the first course. Pineapple 
ice and frozen custard, fancy iced 
cakes, mints and coffee followed.
Dancing was resumed and ended at 
two o’clock with the usual wild scram­
ble to get out of the building before 
the lights went out.
Of course, every one realized, per­
haps the Juniors most of all, that it 
was the “very best Prom” ever given. 
It means a good bit to say that, con­
sidering that all the work was done 
by the girls themselves. How busy 
every one was for days beforehand, 
making flowers and candle shades, 
icing cakes and making mints, but yet 
all the girls agree it was worth the 
trouble. A great deal of credit must 
be given all the girls for helping on 
other committees besides their own, 
and for the general spirit of good will 
which prevailed. Perhaps the one de­
serving the most praise and thanks for 
such a successful result is Miss Sea- 
right, president of the class, who was 
everywhere at once, answering all 
questions cheerfully and tactfully, 
lending a hand wherever needed, in 
short, doing all that was possible to 
make things go quickly and smoothly. 
It is a trying time to be at the head of 
a class but Miss Searight certainly 
came out with flying colors. Miss 
Watson, social chairman of the class, 
and general chairman of the Prom 
committee, also worked hard and de­
serves a great deal of credit. In fact, 
all the girls of the class may be con­
gratulated for the good working spirit 
they manifested. The Juniors wish 
also to thank the Sophomores who 
kindly consented to come and help 
serve. Following is a list of the com­
mittees:
General—Miss Grace Searight, Miss 
Charlotte Watson, Miss Marion Pich- 
el, Miss Constance Stout, Miss Maude 
Sanford, Miss Hazel Thomas, Miss 
Lila Gilmore and Miss Sara Wolfe.
Refreshment—Miss Mary Ride, Miss 
Agnes Sharp, Miss Golda McClelland, 
Miss Grace Saxman, Miss Marion
Groth, Miss Ruth Keiser, and Miss 
Janet Shultz.
Decoration — Miss Pichel, Miss 
Thomas, Miss Mary Louise Irwin, 
Miss Ruth Pontius, Miss Myrtle Got- 
shall, and Miss Marguerite Menges.
Invitation—Miss Elizabeth Magill, 
Miss Mary Loomis, Miss Jane Rogers, 
and Miss Ellen Lewis.
Program and Music—Miss Kather­
ine Haag and Miss Margaret Macrum.

January 30th the Night Pfe^ Class 
held a splendid banquet at the Fort 
Pitt, some forty men being on hand 
to do justice to the splendid repast 
upon command of Prep president 
Jerkins and Master of Ceremonies 
Cox.
Dean Connelley and Mr. Van Dyke, 
vice president of the Real Estate 
Trust Company of Pittsburgh,- and 
Professor Morris were the speakers 
and their words went a long way 
toward making the banquet the suc­
cess it was. Following the speech- 
making, “Sox” Price entertained the 
group with his merry-making, songs 
and monologues, bringing the diners 
back to the happy side of life after 
the forceful and interesting speeches 
made by the after-dinner speakers. 
The affair lasted far into the early 
morning hours and much credit is due 
the Arrangements Committee for hav­
ing brought it to a successful close.
The Industries Bagpipe will un­
doubtedly be available before this edi­
tion of the Tartan. So many inquir­
ies have been made as to its next ap­
pearance that the editorial board is 
anticipating its original intentions by 
being ready for students a week ahead 
of the planned date of publication.
nhu Hepburn’s recent lecture in the 
Student Assembly on the Automobile 
went a long way toward giving many 
of us an insight into a subject which 
a large number think they know about 
and yet so few do. The lecture, to­
gether with the slides furnished an 
interesting and instructive talk.
Just another word of thanks to the 
Plebey from the Middle and Upper 
Classmen in appreciation of the ex­
cellent time shown them at the recent 
Smoker and Minstrel. The quality 
and dignity of the performance be­
speaks the general attitude of the up­
per classmen that this year’s Plebe 
class has men of the right stuff in it.
With the lettering of all rooms, there 
should be no difficulty of next year’s 
entering class in finding their destina­
tion unless some Middle men purpose­
ly heads them the wrong direction.
Inspection trips for the Upper men 
Phe over. It’s a suggestion that these 
students now “inspect” the school 
shops. Acquaintance is an invaluable 
Pyyet to one’s education.

On their recent inspection trip to 
Niagara Falls, the Senior and Junior 
Electricals met Fred L. Koethen, ’OS, 
Chemical, at the International Ache- 
son Graphite Company, where he is 
employed. Koethen, as a member of 
the charter class of Tech, has the 
distinction of being the first graduate, 
for alphabetic reasons, to receive a 
diploma from this school.

“All this reveals steady progress up­
ward and onward to the benefit of 
both labor and capital, which will some 
day rank as one, notwithstanding the 
hesitation to co-operate shown by 
some labor champions who are still 
extremists and do capitalists injustice, 
but this must steadily fade away.
“As I told the great audience at 
Homestead upon my first visit after 
the strike, we shall one day all recog­
nize capital, labor and business abil­
ity ai; a three-legged stool, each neces­
sary for the other, neither first, second 
nor third in rank—all equal. That is 
to be the solution of the problem of 
capital and labor.
“Lest my summing up may seem 
one sided, I will give a proof of my 
effort to hold the scales equal between 
capital and labor. Only once have I 
had experience of a determined effort 
to commit wrong upon the part of 
labor. It is true that the men at the 
Edgar Thomson blast furnaces sent 
in a written demand for an immediate 
advance of wages, which, if refused, 
would end in the furnaces being left 
unfilled.
“Upon receiving a telegram to this 
effect I took a night train from New 
York and got off at the works next 
morning. I found a long train of our 
empty box cars ready to house new 
workmen if necessary. I directed 
these to be pulled out of the yard and 
sent away, stating that there would be 
no strike, and notifying the leaders 
of each of the three different divisions 
of labor to appear as soon as prac­
ticable that I might consult with them. 
The leader of each department with 
one or two aids arrived. We assem­
bled in the committee room. I ad­
dressed the chairman of the commit­
tee of the converting; works first.
oyky oboct ogheementu
“ ‘Mr. Chairman, have we an agree­
ment with you?’
“The answer came, ‘You have, and 
you haven’t enough money to make 
us break it!’
“ ‘There speaks the true American 
workman,’ I exclaimed.
Addressing the rolling mill chair­
man, I asked the same question, and 
the reply was to the same effect. I 
then addressed Mr. Kelly, who had 
presented this demand.
“ ‘Mr. Kelly, have you an agree­
ment with our company?’
He said that an agreement was pre­
sented, and he had signed it and sup­
posed it was all right. Just then the 
irrepressible Captain Jones broke in:— 
‘Mr. Kelly, you know I read all of it 
to you.’
P ‘Silence, Captain, Mr. Kelly can 
speak for himself,’ I said. T receive 
many communications and documents, 
which I haven’t time to read. If they 
were of a formal nature, I have some­
times signed documents without giv­
ing them careful attention, but Mr. 
Kelly, I have always stood prepared 
to take the consequences, and I never 
broke contracts.

Mr. Carnegie paused, then he added, 
with a chuckle:—“And he went!”
The Laird of Skibo had the rapt 
attention of all his audience now as he 
went on:—“A little later some one 
who was coming in as they were pass­
ing out, and who had got in the 
crowd, said that a fine looking fellow 
had pushed across the hall and said to 
Kelly:—‘There is to be no damned

“There was no strike, and that is 
the best service I .ever rendered to 
American labor, so that although I 
was inclined to yield to labor I drew 
the line at contract breaking. This 
was the first time I had found labor 
ready to break a contract, and it was 
the last.
“We once proposed making a change 
in the distribution—not in the amount 
—of wages among the different de­
partments of the steel rail mills as new 
machinery was introduced. The con­
ferences were held in Pittsburgh. 
After several days’ consideration I had 
to leave for New York by the night 
train. The men in the mills asked by 
telegraph if r could meet them in our 
office in the afternoon. I answered, 
‘Yes.’ They came to the city and 
were seated in the board room. Mr. 
Edwards, who was again spokesman, 
began:—
“ ‘Mr. Carnegie, we agree that there 
is a sufficient sum proposed for our 
total work, but we think it is not wise­
ly divided. Now, Mr. Carnegie, you 
take my job’—
“ePkey .o nPn’y Jobu”
“ ‘Order, Mr. Edwards, order. Mr. 
Carnegie takes no man’s job.’

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
nlu Itl.BtgeCi gPCoKgu
The students of the School of Ap­
plied Design are singly benefited 
bv a series of lectures which Mr 
Henry Hornbostel has made of keen 
interest, particularly to the students 
of architecture. The beautiful theater 
of the Design Building was crowded 
with those eager to hear his latest 
talk upon the “Charm of Italian Archi­
tecture.” This talk was one of acute 
fascination, being accompanied b> 
lantern slides of numerous European 
palaces, chapels, villas and gardens. 
Mr. Hornbostel told how we, as 
Americans, have copied, in mock dig­
nity, the Italian art; with no realiza­
tion of its charm or power; culmina­
tion in an art which has some of its 
charm but none of its character. Mr. 
Hornbostel stated that it was primely 
essential for one to study the begin­
nings, the roots, of this Italian ren­
aissance which takes life in the period 
of mediaeval architecture and that in 
order to absorb the powerful charm 
of the Italian renaissance we must 
study its fore-runner—the mediaeval 
architecture.
This growth of the Italian renais­
sance marks a distinct epoch in the 
progress and development of art and 
architecture. It has given to the world 
a work which today is admired as one 
of the perfect masterpieces in archi­
tecture. In point of proportion and 
detail, it may be likened to an exact­
ly written score of music: criticism 
dissolves itself into admiration; and 
centuries have been unable to detect 
a flaw in this branch of the Italian 
renaissance.

The students of the department of 
drama produced “The King’s Thresh­
old,” by William Butler Yeats, in 
honor of the visit of Dr. Richard Bch­
ton, president of the Drama League 
of America, last Monday evening, 
February 1st, in Design Theatre. Dr. 
Burton was very much impressed by 
the work of the students and depart­
ment. It was a source of surprise to 
him to see such a well ,evelope, 
school.

The Dramatic Arts Department has 
for the past few weeks produced a 
play every Friday afternoon. It is 
to be a custom and aim is to give 
the students a broad experience and 
the outsiders a chance to see the work 
of our school. There are in prepara­
tion for these matinees two plays, 
“The Violin Maker of Cremona,” by 
Francis Coppee, and “Mariare,” by 
Robert Louis Stevenson and William

play, “Iphigenia in Tauris.” She was 
much impressed by the uncommon 
Greek play, and its wonderful presen­
tation. She said she had heard of the

not expect to see such a high develop­
ment. The cast was as follows:

Bb gcohe of 40 to 28u
After a rest of two weeks Carnegie 
met the Westinghouse Club last Sat­
urday night and by a strong fin­
ish won by the score of 40 to 
28. Westinghouse started the gams 
with a rush and, if anything, had a 
shade the better of Carnegie in the 
first half. But the playing of both 
teams was good and the score so close 
that the rooters were kept in a con­
stant state of uproar and worry as to 
the outcome. First one team would 
get a lead of a point or two and then 
the other, but never did one team hold 
a lead greater than two baskets. The 
final score of the first half was 15 to 
14, favor the Westinghouse Club.
Ju the second half WeJtingliouse 
seemed to tire, while Carnogie kept 
on at a fast pace and, slowly but sure­
ly, gained a large lead. Carnegie 
showed a vast improvement in this 
half, and played with a great amount 
of sn?p and ginger.
Westinghouse played a fast game, 
had good team work and guarded their 
men exceptionally well. Carnegie had 
a lot of speed and shot with accuracy. 
During the first half of the game their 
team work was not so good, but in 
the last half it was much better.
The star of the game was easily 
Levy, who did some of the best foul 
shooting seen this year. Steadily one 
after another he dropped the fouls in
10 times out of 11 chances.
Schiffer also put up a most aggres­
sive game and landed a total of five 
field goals.
Marcley, at left forward, played an 
excellent game for Westinghouse 
Club. He had a total of four baskets 
and twelve fouls, although his foul 
shooting was not up to that of Levy.
Fihyt IPlfu
Hines started the scoring by pop­
ping in a couple of fouls. Marcley 
also put in two and in addition shot 
a basket. Hines added a couple more 
fouls. Marcley made a foul. Shiffer 
shot two baskets in succession. Brown 
and Marcley caged a couple and then 
Schiffer put in another one. Levy put 
one in. Marcley scored another time 
for Westinghouse. He then shot a 
foul. Meredith, of Carnegie, put one 
in. Marcley finished the half by a 
couple of fouls. Score: Westing­
house 15, Carnegie 14.
gecon, IPlfu
Marcley tossed in a foul; then Levy 
tried his ability at foul shooting and 
landed three in a row for the Plaid. 
Hines widened Carnegie’s lead by 
tossing in a couple of field goals. Then 
Keeler caged one. Marcley shot one 
through the basket and Levy scored 
a point from the foul line. Levy then 
made a field goal. Meredith added 
another basket to Carnegie’s list. Levy 
and Marcley then tried their luck at 
the foul line and put in two a-piece. 
Levy came across with another basket. 
Marcley shot a foul. Harvey put one 
in. Levy once more tossed a foul in 
and Schiffer followed this up with a 
basket. Harvey then made his sec­
ond basket. Marcley and Levy both 
shot a foul. Schiffer caged another 
goal. Two fouls by Levy and a bas­
ket by Henning closed the scoring. 
Score: Carnegie, 40, Westinghouse 28.

Twenty-six Junior and Senior Elec­
trical Engineering students made the 
biennial inspection trip to Niagara 
Falls and points on the way last week 
accompanied by Professor Dennison 
of the Faculty.
Leaving on Sunday night for Erie 
and arriving back from the Falls at 
Thursday midnight, they spent over 
four days in the inspection of large 
engineering power and manufacturing 
plants. At Erie where they stopped 
over on Monday, February 1, the Gen­
eral Electric Co. acted as their hosts 
at a lunch in the company’s restaurant 
which was so good that the party 
missed the train that they had intend­
ed to take out of Erie, and even then 
they had to leave before the pie was 
brought in. They didn’t have to, 
1 hough, for they were compelled to 
wait half an hour for a car to get 
away from the plant.
At Buffalo the Virginia Street Sub­
station of the International Railways 
Co. was visited; and it was here that 
Benny Hantman, in his haste to learn 
all about storage batteries, fell down 
a dozen stairs, and then limped the 
rest of the week.
The trips at Niagara started out only 
an hour behind the scheduled time on 
Tuesday morning, and these led to 
both the American and Canadian 
plants of the Niagara Power Co. 
These plants for power generation 
near Niagara are probably the clean­
est and best housed plants in the 
world. Everything is done with an 
idea of increasing rather than decreas­
ing the scenic value of the place. On 
this day the International Atcheson 
Graphite and Carborundum Compan­
ies were visited, and souvenirs carried 
away from both. An Atcheson Graph­
ite pencil, a carborundum pocket hone 
in a leather case, and a carborundum 
stickpin were given to everybody.
On Wednesday the Ontario Power 
Company, the Hydro-Electric Com­
mission, the International Paper Com­
pany, and the Shredded Wheat Com­
pany were visited. At the last named 
place the interest was hardly electri­
cal; but rather a discussion of the 
superior charms of No. 24, or No. 126. 
The subjects of discussion seemed to 
appreciate it, for they requested that 
the boys “yell for us” which they did 
with a will. It was here, too, that 
the party was set down to a lunch of 
Shredded Wheat, bananas, sugar and 
cream, and to Triscuit, butter and 
cheese.
Throughout these visits, long walks 
through two feet of snow were com­
mon, and it was here that Professor 
Dennison distinguished himself as a 
speed walker, for the party was often 
trailing a half mile or so behind the 
leader. Almost all of the companies 
visited forbade the taking of any 
photographs in their buildings, but it 
seemed that the stricter the rule, the 
more photographs were taken away
from the plant.
The war is evident in Canada, for 
the border is well guarded with sol­
diers, and the surge tank of the On­
tario Power Co. serves as a lookout 
for several Tommy Atkinses. At the 
Hydro-Electric Power Commission, 
which is about half a mile or more in­
land, the place is thoroughly guarded; 
and it was some minutes before the 
credentials obtained entrance. Even 
then a guard of about half dozen of 
the patrol accompanied the party, but 
they proved more interesting than 
the plant to the inspectors, since a 
bigger crowd was questioning and lis­
tening to the tales of the patrol than 
to the engineering guide.
Niagara Falls is not as big as Pitts­
burgh, but it has a nickelodeon, a 
vaudeville show “just as good as the 
Grand”, and a roller skating rink. The 
nick gives tickets that may be used 
several times in one week, and the 
vaudeville has box seats that enable 
the chorus to sing to the handsome 
ones in the boxes quite easily, and it 
is some chorus according to Senior 
Electricals.
Of course there was the usual num­
ber of jokes and fun. On the way to 
Buffalo the choristers gave such selec­
tions as “Oh, My Love, Won’t You 
Please Pull Down That Curtain,” and 
“Somebody’s Coming to our House” 
for the benefit of an ostensibly bridal 
couple,—he was sleeping on her shoul­
der and she was carefully sheltering 
hi Ti,—with the result that the title, 
‘Classy Bum” was politely conferred 
on “Tilly.”
An important query which arose 
and which is left to each gentle reader 
to r.nswer from his own personal ex­
perience is: Does “Buff-et” mean
“Bar”? For information, see Bossart.
Then at Niagara Falls, Gumbart 
was particularly anxious to see the 
falls and got up at 4:30 instead of 
7:15, thanks to B. Hantman. That 
night at supper the page called Mr. 
Tilbrook in the middle of dinner, and 
reminded him so that the whole room 
could hear to be sure not to foget to 
shave before he went to bed. Next 
morning there was a mysterious 
shirt tail parade at 3:00 A. 
M., and about ten o’clock that 
morning all the available hats of 
the party were found impregnated 
with a specially strong brand of choice 
Limburger. In this D. L. Trautman’s 
new one suffered badly, and it was 
good for the perpetrator of this out­
rage that D. L. didn’t know who he 
was. A bottle of choice perfume used 
as a wash for the hat allowed its own­
er to wear it that afternoon.
So with a mixture of work and play 
that made a delightful week of the 
trip, the party arrived home full of 
knowledge of good and evil.

Some hundred and fifty students of 
the Science School gathered in the 
Beanery at the Central Building 
Wednesday night, February 3rd, and 
cut out bandages for the Red Cross 
Society. Old handkerchiefs, shirts,
and other unmentionables, were gath­
ered together and under the direction 
of the wives of the faculty, Mrs. Leete 
being chairman, some three thousand 
bandages were constructed. A light 
lunch was later served by the ladies 
with Mrs. Doyle as chairman of the 
committee.
The bandages will be pressed and 
shipped to the Red Cross Society at 
New York. There they will be steril­
ized and then sent abroad.

Apropos of some time securing a 
decent and suitable entrance to the 
Science Building, a gentleman visitor 
to the Institute recently approached

ence? I am accompanied by a lady 
and do not wish to enter by means 
of the basement.”

CARNEGIE BEFORE COMMISSION
Continued from Page 5 
stamping, and the victory was won. 
We shook hands, and I was off on the 
night train. Money is not the fore­
most or sole object of the better class 
of workmen. That play upon words 
with ‘Billy’ Edwards did the business.” 
Mr. Carnegie’s audience indulged in 
a ripple of appreciate laughter, for 
his own laughter was contagious. 
Then he grew serious and resumed:— 
“We began manufacturing with a 
capital of $7,500. My share I borrowed 
from a bank in Pittsburgh. When 
superintendent of the Pennsylvania 
Railroad I had seen a wooden bridge 
burn, blocking traffic for eight days, 
and I believed in iron bridges; the day 
of steel had not yet arrived. From 
this small beginning grew the Edgar 
Thomson Steel Works, the Homestead 
works, the Duquesne works, the blast 
furnaces and locomotive works at Al­
legheny, our gas wells in West Vir­
ginia, and the great ore fields we 
bought from Mr. Rockefeller.

“In 1888 I published an article in 
«the North American Review which 
was afterward christened ‘Gospel of 
Wealth’ bb Mr. Gladstone. He com­
mented upon it in The Nineteenth 
Century. It attracted attention and 
many answers were sent to this maga­
zine. I quote you the following ex­
tract from the ‘Gospel of Wealth’:— 
“eTe Phoblem of licT Pn, Poohu”
“ ‘Thus is the problem of rich and 
poor to be solved. The laws of accu­
mulation will be left free; the laws 
of distribution free. Individualism 
will continue, but the millionaire will 
be but a trustee for the poor, entrust­
ed for a season with a great part of
the increased wealth of the commun­
ity, but administering it for the com­
munity far better than it could or 
would have done for itself. The best 
minds will thus have reached a stage 
in the development of the race in
which it is clearly seen that there is
no mode of disposing of surplus 
wealth creditable to thoughtful and 
earnest men into whose hands it flows, 
save by using it year by year for the 
general good.
“ ‘This day always dawns. Men 
may die without incurring the pity of 
their fellows, still sharers in great 
business enterprises from which their 
capital cannot be or has not been with­
drawn, and which is left chiefly at 
death for public uses, yet the day is 
not far distant when the man who 
dies leaving behind him millions of 
available wealth, which were free for 
him to administer during life, will pass 
away “unwept, unhonored and un­
sung,” no matter to what use he leaves 
the dross which he cannot take with 
him. Of such as these thè public ver­
dict will then be:—“The man who 
dies thus rich dies disgraced.”
Will golve Phoblemu
“ ‘Such, in my opinion, is the true 
gospel concerning wealth, obedience
to which is destined some day to solve 
the problem of the rich and the poor 
and to bring peace on earth, among 
men good will.’ ”
Complying with the commission’s 
request, Mr. Carnegie next reviewed 
his benefactions, which, it appeared, 
aggregate $325,000,000. The witness 
continued:—
“In accordance with this doctrine, 
my first act upon retiring from busi­
ness was to give $5,000,000 to the 
workmen of the Carnegie Steel Com­
pany as a parting gift, $4,000,000 for 
pensions to the men and $1,000,000 to 
maintain the libraries and halls I had 
built for them. I was greatly pleased 
when later the United States Steel 
Corporation saw fit to duplicate my 
gift, adding $4,000,000 more to the fund 
for pensions. I have just read the fol­
lowing report of this joint fund with 
great satisfaction:—
“ ‘The fourth annual report of the 
United States Steel and Carnegie Pen­
sion Fund, made public today, shows 
that since January 1, 1911, when the 
fund was established, retired employes 
of the Steel Corporation have received 
in pensions $1,575,021.33. For the year
1914 the total disbursement from the 
pension fund amounted to $511,967.90, 
which was a gain of the previous year 
of $89,152.76, and a gain over 1912 of 
$89,152.76, and a gain of $230,510.53 
over the first year of the fund’s exist­
ence.
“ ‘The Pittsburgh district leads in 
the amount of money paid out to the 
aged and infirm former employes of 
the various subsidiary companies. To 
retired mill operatives in the Pitts­
burgh and Valley districts the sum of 
$222,656.33 was paid during the year, 
and to this may be added the sum paid 
to the coke workers in the fields ad­
jacent to Pittsburgh, which amounted 
to $59,995.66, making the total for the 
mills and mines in the district $283,- 
651.99.
“ ‘Pensioners in Cleveland and its 
vicinity received approximately $50,-
000. In the Chicago district the 
amount distributed to former mill 
workers was $30,157.86. In New Eng­
land retired employes of the Worces­
ter (Mass.) plants received $39,855.56.
“ ‘There are now 2,521 beneficiaries 
of the fund. During the year 612 pen­
sioners were added and 183 died. The 
average pensions of the cases added 
were $20.40 a month, the average age 
of the pensioners being 63.33 years 
and the average term of the service 
28.76 years. Under the rules of the 
fund not less than $12 nor more than 
$100 a month is paid.”
“The Hero Fund which I was privi­
leged to found has always interested 
me most deeply, perhaps because the 
idea came to me through personal ex­
perience. Mr. Taylor, who was for­
merly superintendent of a coal mine 
near Pittsburgh, heard that an acci­
dent had occurred and immediately 
drove to the mine and called for vol­
unteers to descend with him to the 
rescue of those below. A number 
promptly responded and many were 
seved, but Mr. Taylor, the volunteer 
hero, lost his life. Here was one of 
the true heroes of civilization, who 
save and serve their fellows. The 
heroes of barbarism wound and slay
theirs.
“I could not rest until I had found­
ed hero funds, with a total capital of 
$11,790,000. The report of the annual 
meeting held at Pittsburgh on January
20 shows awards given to forty heroes 
or their wives and families, with a 
total of 1,027 awards since the fund 
began operations. Every case is most 
carefully investigated. We require 
absolute certainty and proof given by 
witnesses. We want no bogus heroes. 
We find the Mayors and leading citi­
zens of all communities most anxious 
to aid us to obtain such proof.
“The Carnegie Institute of Pitts­
burgh, one of the greatest gifts I have 
made, has not been mentioned. It 
has cost so far $24,000,000 and has 
more than three thousand students, 
from forty-two States, 1,288 of whom 
are men from the industries, trying to 
improve their conditions.
“The fees are only nominal, aver­
aging $25 a year, which is one-fifth to 
one-tenth what is usually charged. The 
cheapest we know of elsewhere 
charges $150.
“During the last year the students 
of the institute have earned in their 
spare time a total of $291,589.62.
“Another feature would, I think, 
surprise you, Mr. Chairman. We have 
a women’s department, educating the 
young to become themselves edu­
cators of others. Each goes through 
a course of instruction, from dish­
washing and sweeping to housekeep­
er, and finally, playing the hostess for 
a term, receives her guests. Mrs. 
Carnegie and I always have luncheon 
with them, and I assure you we have 
the reception and attention of the 
genuine lady. Such distinguished for­
eign visitors as Baron d’Estournelle 
de Constant have been there and have 
not failed to express and publish their 
surprise and pleasure.
“Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of 
the commission, we invite you to at­
tend our next annual meeting, at the 
end of April. The President of the 
United States, when president of 
Princeton University, once made the 
opening address and has given a con­
ditional promise to open the next exer­
cises should conditions permit. I beg 
you to come and insure yon proper 
accommodations in Pittsburgh. We 
will show you everything as it is for 
the year round and let you judge for 
yourself.
“Some were at first apprehensive 
that our workmen would not favor the 
technology schools, which teach young 
men advanced modes of workmanship. 
These fears, however, have proved 
groundless.

“After retiring from business I soon 
found that the widows of friends who 
passed away were sorely troubled how 
best to secure the safety of funds left 
to them. I volunteered to accept the 
money of one widow, giving her my 
note for the amount and agreeing to 
pay six per cent a year. The relief 
she felt was so surprising that I con­
tinued doing this as other dear friends 
passed away until the number of de­
positors has now reached 148, with a 
total of $3,137,394.20 in deposits.
“I do not know of any service to 
widows which brings such relief. It 
relieves the widow of doubt about the 
security of the fund upon which she is 
able to live in comfort. Of course, the 
deposits and security are regularly ex­
amined by a representatives of the 
State Department of Banking. Six 
per cent is a higher rate than banks 
would pay, but I feel quite justified in 
being liberal.
“I confess to being greatly surprised 
to learn within the last few days that 
I have no less than 481 pensioners 
upon my list, receiving a total of 
$214,954.56 a year.
“These pensions are continued to 
the widows. This fund also has been 
kept secret hitherto, but your call for 
statement of all foundations seems to 
embrace this.

“The complete statement up to the 
close of last year shows that the total 
of our foundations and gifts amount 
to $324,657,399. The work still goes 
bravely on, thanks to the wise manage­
ment of the able and willing trustees, 
and also of the employes, who often 
assure me that it is labor in which they 
delight. I am indeed a most fortunate 
man and think myself in nothing else 
so happy as in a soul remembering my 
dear friends, to whom I owe so much.
“Gentlemen, we have six founda­
tions, but I understand that three only 
of these have been called upon to an­
swer questions. If at any time you 
wish to call the heads of the other 
foundations, or ask further questions, 
they will be most happy to respond. 
We have nothing to conceal.”
