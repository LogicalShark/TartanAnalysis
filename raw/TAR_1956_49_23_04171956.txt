Dr. Jones Retires; 
QT To Feel Loss
Carnegie Tech’s Vice President DrT Webster N. Jones has an­
nounced his retirement, effective at the end of the present school 
yar. He will join the Pittsburgh Plate Glass organization as Ad- 
visei of Professional Selection and Training, a position which will
afford him the opportunity for#------------——-------------------------------------

fr. Webster Newton Jones
Tech’s Retiring Vice Fresident
Tech since 1932, when he was ap­
pointed Director of the College of 
Engineering and Science. In his 
24 years here, he has played such 
an important part in the growth 
and progress of Tech that he has 
become known as one of the fore- 
^**st educators in America.
Many things which we now 
take for granted were first pro­
posed by him and put into effect 
through his efforts. Dr. Jones is 
one of the leading exponents of 
the Carnegie Plan, and he was 
instrumental in the replacement 
of shop courses with a more well- 
rounded curriculum.

New Rush Idea 
Devised By CFP
At the CFP meeting last Mon­
day, the main item of business 
was approval of next fall’s Rush 
Week schedule. An innovation of 
this new schedule is the proposed 
tours for rushees, which will be 
held on Thursday and Friday of 
Rush Week. Rushing will official­
ly begin on a Wednesday, as usual. 
At the smoker on Wednesday 
night, the rushees will sign up 
for the tours of all the fraternity 
houses. During the tours, each 
group of 15 or 20 rushees will 
spend approximately a half-hour 
at each house. What activity will 
occupy this time is up to the in­
dividual fraternities.
It was suggested that this sys­
tem could replace the signature 
card used for the past several 
yeai's, by making those who par­
ticipate in a tour automatically 
eligible for pledging. Those not 
on a tour would still be required 
to get a card filled out.
Other inter-fraternity business 
was virtually negligible. Officers 
for the coming semester term will 
be elected at the next meeting.

Tartan Tourney
On Saturday, April 21, the De­
bate Club of Carnegie Tech will 
hold its annual invitational de­
bating tournament here on cam­
pus. This will be the sixth an­
nual Tartan Debate Tournament 
with approximately 15 to 20 teams 
participating. These teams from 
schools throughout the eastern 
part of the United States will be 
•debating the national topic: “Re­
solved that the non-agrieultural 
industries of the United States 
guarantee their employees an an­
nual wage.”
Registration for the tournament 
is at 8:30 a.m. in Porter Hall 100 
and afterwards there will be four 
rounds of orthodox style debates. 
Guests are welcome to sit in on 
any debate if they so desire.
Tournaments Unique
The Tartan tournaments are 
unique among debate tourna­
ments in their method of proced­
ure. Pairings between teams are 
made initally at random. For the 
second round, pairings are made 
according to results of the previ­
ous round (i.e. winners meet win­
ners.) The procedure is the same 
for the third and fourth round.

Cooper Union Unique 
The Cooper Union is a remark­
able college in several ways. For 
one, there is no tuition charged for 
any of the academic programs of­
fered, including engineering, fine 
arts,« and an extensive adult edu­
cation program. This necessitates 
extreme selectivity in the choice 
of students, and those accepted are 
of a higher caliber than students 
in almost all other American col­
leges and universities.
Only 25 students are accepted in 
each of the four engineering de-
by Debate Club president, Jack partments each year. The total en- 
Belkin, in the Blue Room of More- j rollment of the institution is about 
wood Gardens. The trophies to be 650 day and 750 evening students, 
presented are on display in the The no tuition policy is made pos-

Once again it is spring and 
young man’s fancy lightly turns to 
thoughts of pushing buggies up 
hills at midnight, practicing bal­

all good men come to the aid of 
their fraternity.
This year there are 19 entries 
in the Sweepstakes, commonly 
known as the buggy race. The 
committee expressed regret that 
there are no independent entries

This week’s problem is taken 
from the Math Mirror of Spring 
1955. It is one in which the use of 
complex numbers is helpful, but 
it lends itself to a geometric solu­
tion.m
Problem: Prove that the prod­
uct of the lengths of the lines con­
necting all of the vertices with 
each other of a regular polygon 
of n sides inscribed in a circle of 
radius is equal to one.
Solution to the snow problem: 
dx/dt equals k/t—T) where T 
equals starting time. This equation 
has the general solution x equals 
k ln(t—T).
Letting s equal time at 3 o’clock 
and using the fact that the plow 
travelled twice as far during^ the 
second hour as during the first: 
2k(ln(2 + s—T)—ln(l + s—T)) 
equals k(ln(l + s—T)—ln(s—T)). 
Upon simplification this yields a 
cubic equation in which the cubic 
terms cancel and s—T may be 
solved for. Result: s—T equals 
—1 + root 5 all over 2, which 
equals .618.
The snow started at 2:23.

Architect Chosen 
To Design New 
Carnegie Union
By Bob Jack
Plans for Tech’s new Union are 
progressing rapidly. The campus 
design committee and the auxil­
iary service committee have re­
ceived the consultants’ report and 
made their recommendations to 
the president.
The consultant, Porter Butts of 
University of Wisconsin, express­
ed considerable satisfaction with 
the large response to the ques­
tionnaire submitted last semester 
to the students. Over 40 percent 
of Tech’s students returned the 
forms, giving the consultant a 
good picture of our needs here at 
Tech. Mr. Butts’ report will be of 
considerable value in helping the 
planners to avoid the pitfalls 
other schools have encountered 
in building their unions.
Designer Tech Graduate
The Board of Trustees has se­
lected the Pittsburgh architectur­
al firm of Ingham, Boyd, and Pratt 
to design the building. Mr. Pratt 
is an alumnus of Tech who grad­
uated in 1930. Ingham, Boyd, and 
Pratt were commissioned to do the 
job on the basis of interviews and 
the record they have made for 
themselves in the design of public 
schools, college buildings, and hos­
pitals.
The new Union will provide 
65,000 square feet of floor space, 
about one-third of which will 
be occupied by food service, 
replacing Skibo completely. Other 
large areas will consist of a ball­
room, auditorium, and party room. 
Parking is also one of the prob­
lems connected with the new Un­
ion and improved parking facili­
ties will be one of its features. 
Even at the set cost, one and three 
quarter million, there will be 
some limitations to the functions 
of the buildings; however, it is 
being designed with the possibil­
ity of future additions in mind.
The landscape architect for the 
project has also been selected. He 
is Mr. Ralph Griswold, former 
head of Pittsburgh parks. Mr. 
Griswold is currently engaged in 
restoring the Agara, the ancient 
meeting place at the foot of the 
Acropolis in Athens.
P.C.W., now Chatham College, 
is the second oldest women’s col­
lege in the United States.

Needed: Dean of Students
Dr. Graham’s loss will leave 
Tech without a dean of students 
for the second time in two years. 
He succeeded Ben E. David in this 
position last summer, having pre­
viously been assistant dean in the 
College of Engineering and Sci­
ence.

motes scholarship, better rela­
tions for all women on this cam­
pus, dignified publication of sor­
ority events, and in general, it es­
tablishes laws which the local 
sororities are expected to follow. 
During this year, Panhel has 
sponsored the fall and spring rush­
ing open houses, the Christmas 
Party for freshmen woman, the 
rushing assembly and question 
box, co-sponsorship of Greek 
Sing, the annual Panhel formal, 
and such philanthropic projects 
as Red Cross drives and provid­
ing entertainment for neighboring 
hospitals. *
The main project now under 
consideration is revising the pres­
ent rushing system, which is un­
satisfactory to both rushees and 
actives. Plans are now being made 
for this new system which will 
be submitted to the sororities for 
approval, and if passed, will be 
put into effect for the 1956-1957 
school year.
Dr. Graham studied civil engi­
neering at Ohio State and Prince­
ton Universities, and earned his 
D.Sc. degree from Carnegie Tech. 
He was associated with Bethlehem 
Steel from 1940 to 1942, when he 
entered the army corps of engi­
neers. He was honored for his 
service during the entire Italian 
campaign, and was a major at the 
time of his discharge in 1945. In 
1946, he joined the faculty of the 
Tech civil engineering department.
Becomes Assistant Dean
Since then, his rise has been 
rapid. In 1947, he was promoted to 
assistant professor of civil en­
gineering, and he became assist­
ant to the dean in the College of 
E & S a year later. He later ad­
vanced to assistant dean and as­
sociate professor of civil engineer­
ing.
In 1953, the Pittsburgh Cham­
ber of Commerce selected Dr. Gra­
ham as one of the 100 outstanding 
young men of this city. He is a 
member of several professional so­
cieties, and has served as president 
of the Pittsburgh chapter of the 
National Society of Professional 
Engineers.
His new position will be one of 
great prestige, but his departure 
from Carnegie Tech will be deep­
ly felt by those who have known 
and worked with him.

[Continued from page 1] 
Montana was Harold Urey, who 
has since won a Nobel Prize.
Willing Counselor
At Tech he has been a willing 
counselor to innumerable stu­
dents. He also has handled all 
‘selective service problems of the 
school, including students, faculty, 
and non-academic personnel.
Dr. Jones is a person of nation­
wide repute, and as such, he is 
constantly beleaguered by re­
quests to serve on committees 
and for speaking engagements. 
One of the more important com­
mittees on which he presently is
serving is the Pennsylvania State 
Advisory Committee on Scientific, 
Engineering, and Specialized Per­
sonnel, which guides selective 
service on the choice of men 
working or studying in these 
fields.
For the past three years, he has 
served as chairman of the scho­
larship committee for Pittsburgh 
Plate Glass and one of its subsi- 
dairies. His new job wil entail 
somewhat similar duties on a 
larger scale.
Many, Many Activities
Dr.' Jones has served on the 
ECPD, the engineering schools’ 
accrediting body, since its incep­
tion in 1932. He is a past president 
of the AICHE, the Harvard
Chemical Association, and the En­
gineers Society of Western Penn­
sylvania. The national and local 
civic, social and honorary or­
ganizations in which he particip­
ates are far too numerous to 
enumerate.
• His colorful career has been 
similar to a Horatio Alger success 
story. He was born and raised in 
a small mining town in Missouri. 
His parents were Welsh and he 
was the youngest of seven chil­
dren. At the age of 12, he helped 
to earn his support by working in 
the coal mines at 50 cents for a 
ten hour day.
Several Degrees
After his graduation from high 
school, he felt he should go to 
work, but his mother persuaded 
him to go on to college. He was 
graduated from the University of 
Missouri in chemistry, and one 
year later earned his Master’s de­
gree. He has since added a Ph.D. 
from Harvard, a D. Eng. from 
Stevens Institute of Technology, 
and a L.L.D. from Norwich Univ­
ersity.
Dr. Jones taught chemistry at 
Maine, Missouri, Montana, and 
Purdue Universities, and even 
spent one year at Radcliffe Col­
lege, prior to his service 4n World 
War I. After the war, he joined 
the Goodrich company, where he 
remained until returning to edu­
cation in 1932. He led the College 
of E & S for 21 years, first as 
Director and later Dean. In 1953, 
he was appointed vice president 
in charge of industrial and gov­
ernment relations. In ' this posi­
tion, he has shown his deep in­
terest in Tech by bettering our 
relations with industry.
Loves Carnegie Tech
A hard worker for his school, 
Dr. Jones has taken only two va­
cations in 24 years. He feels very 
grateful for the two secretaries 
who have helped him keep things 
straight, first Mrs. Jean Duffin, 
and now Miss Ricky Murray.
Although Dr. Jones is enthusi­
astic about his new job with the 
glass company, he has become so 
closely involved with Carnegie 
Tech that his influence will al­
ways be felt. He said “I owe 
Carnegie Tech a deep debt of 
gratitude for affording me the op­
portunity to pursue my objec­
tives, and the principal objective 
is to make men out of boys.”

most things in life, is % push and

lished a new record of 2 minutes, 
26 seconds, breaking their own 
record of 2 minutes 28 seconds. 
There is much speculation on 
whether or not it is physically 
possible to better this record. At 
any rate 19 buggies will be try­
ing.
Plank Jousting
Plank * jousting will be held 
near the Carnegie Union at 2:00 
on Saturday, May 5. Kappa Sigs, 
who won last year’s competition 
through a combination of ballet 
technique and soft sneakers and, 
the rumor goes, through certain 
prehensile anatomical endow­
ments, have been in training for 
a repeat victory this year.
Meanwhile, faculty members 
have been surreptiously practic­
ing long pitches down Porter Hall 
in preparation for the annual egg- 
throwing contest. The psychology 
department set a new record of 
103 feet 4.50 inches last year. 
There is no limit to the number 
of entries from each department 
and all entries should be register­
ed in Morewood Gardens 2C6 by 
April 25.
FLASH
(This report of dubious authenti­
city was received recently via the 
Carnegie Technical.)
It was announced by the ad­
ministration today that due to lack 
of funds all plans for the new 
Student Union have been can­
celled. Dr. Warner emphasized 
that this is only a postponement 
and that the plans will again be 
discussed before 1965. Meanwhile 
a new survey will be undertaken 
to determine the necessary fea­
tures of the proposed Union. Funds 
that have already been allocated 
for the building will be used to 
subsidize the coffee cliche at Skibo.
Playhouse
Pittsburgh Playhouse Director 
Frederick Burleigh has announced 
complete casting for the annual 
Spring Musical Revue, “What’s 
The Rush?”, which will open its 
run at the Craft Avenue Theater 
on Saturday, April 14.
Principal roles in the revue will 
be acted by William Glennon, 
Eleanor Bruno, Robert Parks, Jo­
sephine Chianese, and Raymond 
Bevilasqua. Eleanor Bruno was 
graduated from Carnegie Tech last 
spring, and Ray Bevilacqua is a 
senior in Tech’s drama depart­
ment. Leading singing roles will 
feature John Smolko, Velma 
Carey, and Angela Romeo. Other 
singers include Robert Castle, 
Frank Harkins, Diane Lawrence, 
William Phillips, Joy Lynne Sica, 
and John Driscoll.
The dancing chorus, which is 
headed by John Smolko, Janice 
Norris and Gene Ray, includes 
Larry Berger, George Bornyek, 
Carol Weaver, Donn Gibson, Vyla 
Hudson, John Mullen, Jean My­
ers, Dick Ormay, Donna Jean 
Parker, and Joan Erdeljac.
Charles Strouse composed the 
music and Lee Adams has written j 
the lyrics .and sketches with addi­
tional lyrics and sketches by Mike 
Stewart. Felisa Conde is staging 
the musical numbers and creating 
the choreography and James Reed 
Lawlor is the musical director. 
Frederick Burleigh is directing the 
comedy sketches as well as pro­
ducing the entire production.
Fabric Fashion Show
The twenty - seventh annual 
Carnegie Tech-Katvfmann Fabric 
Fashion Show preparations are m 
full swing again this year.' The 
date is Saturday afternoon, April 
28 at 2:30. The show is planned 
by the senior professional cloth­
ing projects class in the depart­
ment of home economics in co­
operation with Kaufmann’s de­
partment store .
The fabrics are supplied by 
Kaufmann’s and garments are 
made and modeled by the junior 
and senior clothing students. These 
designs may be originals, adapta­
tions, or an interesting way of 
using fabric in a commercial pat­
tern.
This year an added feature will 
be a scene of coats and suits con­
structed by the junior home eco­

THE MANY LOVES 
OF THORWALD DOCKSTADER
When .Thorwald Dockstader—sophomore, epicure, and sports­
man-first took up smoking, he did not simply choose the first 
brand of cigarettes that came to hand. No, indeed! He did what 
any sophomore, epicure, and sportsman would do: he sampled 
several brands and then picked the gentlest, tastiest, most 
thumpingly, wondrously, unfailingly pleasing of all — Philip 
Morris, of corris!
Similarly, when Thorwald Dockstader took up girls, he did 
not simply select the first one who came along. No,- indeed! 
Thorwald sampled. He took out several likely girls and then he 
compared their charms and then he made his choice.
His first date was with an English lit major named Elizabeth 
Barrett Grish, a wisp of a girl with luminous eyes and a soul 
that shimmered with a pale, unearthly beauty. Trippingly, 
trippingly, she walked with Thorwald upon the beach and sat 
with him behind a windward dune and listened to a sea shell 
and sighed sweetly and took out a little gold pencil and a little 
morocco notebook and wrote a little poem:
I will lie upon the shore,
I will be a dreamer.
I will feel the sea once more 
Pounding on my femur.
Thorwald’s second date was with a physical ed major named 
Peaches Glendower, a broth of a girl with a ready smile and a 
size 18 neck. She took Thorwald down to the cinder track where 
they jogged around thirty or forty times to open up the pores.
<>'40 times to open, up the,
Then they played four games of squash, six sets of tennis, 36 
holes of golf, nine innings of one-o-cat, four periods of rugger, 
^ six chukkers of lacrosse, and a mile and a quarter of leap frog. 
Then they worked out for a few hours on the parallel bars, the 
flying rings, and the bongo board, and then went ten rounds 
with the eight-ounce gloves. Then they had heaping bowls of 
bran and whey, exchanged a manly handshake, and went home 
to their respective whirlpool baths.
Thorwald’s final date was with a golden-haired, crcamy-browed, 
green-eyed, red-lipped, full-calved girl named Totsi McEstway. 
Totsi was not majoring in anything. As she often said, “Gee 
whillikers, what’s college for anyhow - to fill your head full of 
M morbid old facts, or to discover the shining essence that is
VOL.49
Totsi stalled the evening with Thorwald at a luxurious res­
taurant where she consumed her own weight in Cornfeh rock 
hen. From there they went to a de luxe movie palace where Totsi 
had popcorn witfi butter and a bag of chocolate covered raisins 
— also with butter. Then they went to a costly ballroom and 
cha-cha’d till dawn, tipping the band wildly all the while. Then 
they went to a Chinese restaurant where Totsi, unable to deci­
pher the large and baffling menu, solved her problem by order­
ing one of everything. Then Thorwald took her to the women’s 
dorm, boosted her in the window, and went downtown to wait 
#for the Morris Plan office to open.
While waiting, Thorwald thought over all of his girls and 
came to a decision. “It is clear,” said Thorwald, “that I am not 
yet ready for girls.” “It is equally clear,” he continued, “that 
a man needs a gentle companion, and who,” he asked, “will be 
my gentle companion?” “Why, PHILIP MORRIS, of corris,” 
he answered. “Philip Morris will be my tender comrade, my 
solace and my strength, my friend in adversity, my shelter in 
vicissitude, my boon and bosom buddy,” and, so saying, Thor­
wald lit a PHILIP MORRIS and was content. ©Max ghulman, 1956
j. The maker» of Philip Morris, who bring you this column every 
Aeek, hope that Thorwald will soon find the girl of his dreams, and 
that they will make beautiful smoke rings together—with Philip Morris, 
of corris!

Pa*e 4—CARNEGIE TARTAN—Tuesday, April 17, 1956
The Proposed Student Constitution
Open Letter To Students— <
Six weeks ago Mortar Board and Omicron Delta Kappa presented 
to Student Council a proposal for a revision of student government 
on this campus. Also given to Council were the comments and sug­
gestions of the third Leaders Conference—a meeting whose job it was 
to evaluate the document.
From this proposal and these comments and suggestions, the 
Constitution Committee of Student Council has written the constitu­
tion for a new student government which is contained in this Tartan. 
Student Council wishes to thank Diane Farrington, its vice president, 
who served as chairman of this committee, and Cissie Rafferty, Ron 
Draper, Mr. Fenton and Mr. Houghteling, who served on the com­
mittee.
A document as comprehensive as this, covering so many facets of 
campus life, inevitably will not satisfy everyone. To those who will 
quarrel with the detail, we offer the following: the framers of this 
constitution, realizing that they were neither experts on govern­
ment nor prophets, have made the governmental structure flexible 
enough to change readily if the test of time proves certain constitu­
tional provisions unworkable, burdensome, inadequate, etc.
To those who will quarrel with the theory (principle of three 
branch government, membership, etc.) we can only say that the 
effort to set up the essential framework was a conscientious one; 
that other systems were considered; that the system chosen seemed 
to be the most workable and effective of the plans considered. Of 
these people we also ask patience: let the government function for a 
while; it is difficult to predict a priori just how effective it will be, 
but it is certain that changes can be made once data on the behavior 
of the system in operation is available.
The new government is designed to be a strong centralized govern­
ment whose powers are separated into three branches. The present 
Student Council in practice is no more than one organization among 
many on this campus. Its functions are mainly regulatory. It is 
lawmaker, executor, and judge and, as a result of this overlap, 
performs none of these tasks particularly well.
If student government is to be of any use on a college campus, it 
must be a kind of super-organization, aiding, coordinating, sponsor­
ing, and controlling the activities of the other organizations and the 
student body, as well as providing necessary services for these groups. 
(I suppose one might call this the “federal” system of government).
In this government, legislative power is given to a body directly 
representative of the student body; executive power is given to exist­
ing student organizations so chosen that their present authority 
extends into every phase of student activity on the campus; judi­
cial power is given to a supreme court and to the existing student 
courts.
Come And Discuss
Discussion of this constitution will begin at the regular Student 
Council meeting to be held on Wednesday. April 18, at 4:30 p.m. in 
Porter Hall 100. The student body is urged to attend and discuss the 
document with the Student Council members. Plans for further open 
sessions of Council to discuss the constitution will also be made at 
Wednesday’s meeting. When discussion is completed, and necessary 
'revisions arising out of the discussion made, the finished document 
will be submitted to a vote of Student Council. If it is approved, it 
will go to a ratification assembly of the student body. If it is 
passed by this assembly, it will become effective, subject to the OK 
of the Executive Board of Carnegie Institute of Technology.
I emphasize that Student Council urges students to read and 
discuss the new constitution and to come to the Student Council 
meeting Wednesday to present their views on the proposed new 
government.
Sincerely yours,
Edward Feigenbaum 
Student Council President.

Don’t Cringe
The reason for an unseasonably large 
Tartan this week is obviously due to that 
huge document splattered all over pages four, 
five, seven and twelve. Anyone who has got­
ten this far without at least glancing over 
the Student Council constitution had better 
prepare for a shock if he feels the urge to 
look at it now, for its mere length seems over­
whelming.
This is material evidence of the work 
that has been done by ODK and Mortar 
Board during the past few months. Actu­
ally, when all of the legal reduncancies are 
overlooked, the constitution isn’t so fore­

Energetic Spoons
The rate of silverware turnover in Skibo is indeed one 
oi the seven wonders of Carnegie Tech. Just a few months 
ago, something like 50 dozen teaspoons were added to the 
ever diminishing collection, and last week teaspoons were at 
a premium. People were observed looking forlornly at the 
empty spoon trays, and then stirring coffee with everything 
from forks to pica sticks.
Perhaps a new recipe calling for the inclusion of tea­
spoons has been devised by the Skibo cooks, or perhaps the 
patrons find the spoons more palatable than the food, but 
most likely the spoons have developed a habit of sneaking 
out in coat pockets, shoes, slide rules cases, sleeves, etc.
This is what used to happen to pepper shakers in Skibo; 
that’s why they are so hard to find now. This is also what 
has happened to many salt shakers in the Morewood dining 
room. All of these implements have escaped the eating 
areas and have never been replaced.
The solution rests on both the cafeterias and their patrons. 
The cafeterias could probably make a less feeble effort to 
keep such supplies on hand. The patrons could also probably 
prevent the spoons and shakers from gaining their freedom. 
Or perhaps tuition should be increased per student by an 
amount sufficient to cover the cost of one set of silverware 
and shakers per year.
The Loivdotvn
This is an explanation which should have been appended 
as an editor’s note to the letter in last week’s issue entitled 
“Buy A Thistle.” For anyone acquainted with the facts, Mr. 
Burke must have seemed a bit over-enthusiastic in his ex­
cessive praise for the new Thistle publisher, due to the fact 
that Mr. Burke is a paid employee of the Taylor Publishing 
Company and no doubt was instrumental in landing the 
Thistle for his employer. This, however, should not detract 
from the main thought—the Thistle needs more customers.

Scot Not A Scot
As a matter of pure clarification concern­
ing our sister publication, the Scot, we will 
attempt here to explain the facts of the situa­
tion which has arisen. No, the Scot wasn’t 
banned from the campus. Yes, Scot publica­
tions, Incorporated will put out another issue 
this year, but it won’t be recognizable as a 
Scot. It will be entirely literary in nature 
and will be called Expression.
No, the staff didn’t chicken out, but they 
felt there would be insufficient time this year 
to gather another conglomoration of stuff 
comparable to that in the Hiss-Poo. There­
fore, since there was to be a literary maga­
zine anyhow, it was decided to publish it 
using the Scot’s advertising contracts.
Notas De Un Oyente
By Luis de la Macorra
We must remember that from now on Uncle 
Mash wants us to say hello to him everytime we 
meet him on campus. All this develops from the 
fact that he wants to know everyone, and then 
these hellos will become automatic. Freshmen be­
ware! Don’t let this guy become too friendly with 
you. I personally would not advise it. But don’t 
ignore him either, he might get too lonesome . . .
* * *
The activities key committee has already been 
set up; this fact might prove of interest to the 
juniors and seniors who would like to get some 
due recognition for their work in extra curricular 
activities. The closing date for turning petitions in 
to the Dean of Men’s office has been set on April
27. The keys will be awarded during Call Day in 
Spring Carnival.
* * *
WRCT, with the help of the public relations 
office has been trying to get a spot in ‘Monitor.’ 
The idea is that on Saturday afternoon of Spring 
Carnival, ‘Monitor’ would have a spot dedicated 
to Carnegie Tech. They have been planning to 
include intereviews with the driver of the winning 
buggy and with the people that help build it. They 
have also planned to include a couple of songs 
from Scotch and Soda, and maybe intereviews with 
people from the cast. If the whole idea comes 
through it will prove of interest since ‘Monitor’ is 
transmitted across the nation. I sincerely wish the 
people in charge the best of luck.
* * *
I don’t understand why some people love to 
destroy property that is not their own, in this case 
I should say steal because that is what happened. 
In the first case; two days after S ’n S put up 
some pictures on the Skibo bulletin board two of 
these pictures disappeared. It is not what the pic­
tures might cost, it is the principle of the whole 
matter. Those pictures are completely irreplacable. 
If the persons that took them, or should I say 
stole them, wanted them so badly, they could at 
least contact some one from S ’n S and a copy 
might have been made for them. In the second 
case two weeks after A Phi O had performed a 
service for our community by setting signs on the 
campus lawns, 95% of these signs had been stolen. 
Tell me sincerely, is A Phi O going to wait until 
a saturation point is reached and everybody on
Inquiring Reporter-
Cheating
NEW YORK^-Cheaters outnumber non-cheaters 
today in most United States colleges and high 
schools according to the April issue of McCall’s 
magazine.
The magazine placed the blame on students* 
parents, and teachers alike but placed special em- ^ 
phasis on adults who cut ethical corners, thereby 
setting a bad example fox' their children.
Overemphasis has been placed on the importance 
of marks. Such high value is placed on grades 
that a student will use any means to get an A or
B. In the struggle to get a good grade, the student 
loses sight of the real goals of education. In nine 
cases out of ten, the pressure for good grades, with 
all its attendant bribing and bullying by parents, 
comes from home, not school.
“Cheating is a national problem, not confined ^ 
to any one area of the country, any one type »of 
neighborhood, any one type of school,” McCall’s 
reports. “It involves youngsters from good families 
as well as bad, graduate students as well as first- 
year high-schoolers.”
Mere copying of someone’s homework has be­
come so routine that most students do not even 
consider it cheating. Many teachers no longer grade 
homework, knowing that much of it has been 
copied.
Cheating today has all the aspects of cloak and | 
dagger work, with such cases on record as that of 
the two Illinois high school seniors who posed as 
gas meter inspectors to gain entrance to a pro­
fessor’s home; or the countless cases of students, 
both college and high school, breaking into file 
rooms to steal forthcoming examination.s.
“Honor systems—used in ten per cent of the 
nation’s colleges and less than one per cent of its 
high schools—are not proof against it*” the maga­
zine explains, “as witness the fact that 93 cadets, 
the cream of the football squad, were caught cheat- * 
ing at West Point a few years.ago, and 109 students 
were caught at the University of Florida.”
The clue as to how the majority of students 
surveyed felt is to be found in scores of unsolicited 
comments like:
“How else are you supposed to get ahead?”
“It’s okay if you get away with it.”
“It can’t be so bad when everyone I know does
it.”
McCall’s comments: “Couldn’t the time and ef­
fort teachers now spend trying to outwit cheaters 
be far better used in an all-out attack on the roots 
of the problem?”* * *
By Sally Day
The Inquiring Reporter this week asked several 
undergraduates how serious they think the cheat­
ing problem is at Tech.
John Berkencamp, sophomore, EE—I don’t think 
that there is much cheating on tests because of the 
fact that you do not get a chance to cheat. How­
ever, I do think it is present in regard to lab » 
reports.
Jan Renshaw, junior, MMCC science—The great­
est advantages from cheating are only temporary, 
because eventually, one regrets not having acquired 
knowledge on his own. Cheating makes one too 
dependent upon others; he avoids the opportunities 
to develop his abilities and resourcefulness.
Nick Nicholas, sophomore, physics—I do not 
think that there is much extreme cheating on this
Andy Wonders . . .
. » . When the students that get low grades 
will mature. They sometimes childishly bemoan 
the existence of “curve-breakers” hoping in some 
way these workers cause them to get low grades.
. . . Why all the big donations are going to 
Pitt these days.

Cheating—
[Continued from page 6] 
campus. There is cheating, but it 
is not a problem. Primarily, peo­
ple copy homework and lab re­
ports. The reason for this is that 
everyone wants to get good grades, 
and there is so much pressure 
that they cheat.
«•““Charlie Glotz” — You must 
cheat sometimes to keep from 
being cheated. Some guys are 
cheating and getting good grades; 
if you do not, you are going to 
suffer on your own grade.
Dick Urbanowski, sophomore, 
ChemE—I don’t thing that cheat­
ing is too prevalent on tests. Some­
times it isn’t possible, for the 
school makes it this way.
Cathy Engle, freshman, MMCC 
«fcemistry—I do not relieve that 
cheating on tests happens too 
often. However, on homework it 
is a different story. Cheating'does 
not help a person to learn.
Nancy Tresky, sophomore, secre­
tarial—Most students realize that 
cheating does not help them learn 
anything. The only way a person 
can really learn a subject is by 
doing research in it themselves. 
When people do cheat, I think 
iL'at the reason is because they 
cannot get the work or because 
they feel that it doesn’t make any 
difference in their comprehension 
of the subject—for example, “busy 
work.”
Barbara Clark, senior, dramatics
« 1 think that cheating happens 
primarily at exam time. In a pro­
fessional school, we do not seem 
to run into it as much as in other 
spools. However, I think it is 
Jfidre prevalent in your acada- 
demic subjects. Also, there is not 
too much opportunity to cheat.
Over The 
Skibo Table
By Marshall R. Pihl
This reporter went to visit 
Scotch and Soda Sunday to see 
ikhat happens in the gym every 
night and day of the week. Before 
I went, I knew as little as every­
body else who has heard the 
weird combination of hammer
blows, squeaky pulleys, slap- 
happy paint brushts, and the 
screams of distraught directors 
filling the air every day outside 
the gym.
Now, mind you, it was Sunday 
. . . a day of rest and “Let’s-do- 
it-tomorrowism” for the rest of 
the campus . . . but at the gym 
there were no less than 24 people 
working feverishly to get “Head 
Over Heels” on the road. There 
was a reminder on the wall which 
warned: “Only 15 more days until 
openfhg.”
The rehearsal I caught was of 
Shirley Mendonca doing “The 
Misty Night” ... or something 
like that ... a song that she 
wrote and is singing in the show. 
As they worked there in the cen­
ter of Thistle Hall; dancers, busi­
ness people, costume workers, 
writers and a certain Tartan re­
porter provided a distracting buzz.
The spirit is high over the gym, 
optimism rides herd, and this re­
porter is panting to see the show.* * *
You will note, my friend, that 
there was a pleasant omission in 
the TARTAN last week. Namely, 
it was the lack of a “Notas De Un 
Oyente,” by Luis “Wetback” De 
La Macorra. I’m told that the 
omission was the result of a dis­
covery that Luis is, in reality 
Vasco De Gamma Von Rietchlag- 
gen, an undercover agent for the 
Mexican Fascist Youth Move­
ment. But Editor Bob Russell, be­
ing a tolerant, liberal, under­
standing gentlemen, has decided 
to continue printing Mr. Macor­
ra’s homespun propaganda.* * *
Under the Table: The New
York State Tax office in Albany 
is used to receiving an occasional 
shirt along with tax returns. But, 
this year, the bureau received five 
white buttons. Along with the 
buttons came this note: “The but­
tons you can have. The shirt 1 
need.”

Down Under: An Aborigine
died in New Zealand. His death 
would have gone unnoticed if it 
were not for the fact that he was 
110 years old, left several hund­
red children, grand-children and 
great-grandchildren, and wore 
out four wives,

Golf, Tennis Teams 
Preparing For Season
Golf Matches 
Begin On Friday
The golf bug has been stimu­
lated by the few warm sunny 
spring days we’ve had. The links- 
men have blown the dust off their 
clubs and are returning to their 
favorite pastime — chasing that 
disobedient little white pill. Try­
outs for this year’s Tech squad 
were held last week Tuesday and 
Friday on the Alcoma Country 
Club course. On the basis of these 
qualifying rounds and playoffs to­
day, the team will be cut to seven 
men, six regulars plus one alter­
nate.
This spring’s matches begin on 
Friday, April 20, when the team 
plays West Virginia here, and con­
tinue through May 18, when they 
close the season against W. & J. 
This year’s foes also include Pitt, 
Geneva, Duquesne, Westminster, 
Grove City, as well as all district 
teams in the Invitational Tourna­
ment at Meadville. Coach Rogers 
indicates that Pitt, West Virginia, 
and W. & J., in that order, are our 
three strongest opponents.
Promising- Freshmen
When asked about the outlook 
for the season, Mr. Rogers em­
phasized the dependence of the 
team’s success on certain “if 
clauses.” Several bad breaks have 
hampered the squad’s develop­
ment: the illness of Tom Schorr, 
Marty Fertal’s torn cartilage, and 
the scholastic probation of prom­
ising sophomore Venturella. Tom 
Schorr, a returning letterman and 
“number 2” man last year, was 
expected to lead this year’s team 
[Continued on page 9J
Promising Season 
Seen For Tennis
Teen’s tennis team is preparing 
for its opener against Duquesne 
this Saturday with the Tartan 
starting lineup still unsure. The 
squad is looking forward to an 
even more successful season than 
last year’s fine 5-3 record, since 
only Jim Miller, Tech’s big gun 
last year, is missing from the 1955 
varsity sextet.
The strong quintet of returning 
lettermen, Dussair, Glaser, Na- 
worski, Rowley, and Schaul, are 
jockying for high position for this 
Saturday’s home match. Fresh­
man Joe Smeets is tentatively 
picked for the one open spot on 
the squad on the basis of his per­
formance last fall in the varsity 
tournament, but he is facing 
strong competition from Wickham 
and others. The second match is 
at Grove City on April 25.
Moses Well Liked
The team is preparing for the 
coming season under the able 
tutelage of Coach Frann Moses. 
No coach is better liked by his 
athletes. His mild-mannered lead­
ership and long experience with 
the game have enabled him to 
keep producing good teams from 
more than a generation and a half 
of Tech students.
Mr. Moses began as freshman 
tennis „coach 36 years ago. When 
the high schools in this area stop­
ped playing college freshmen, the 
frosh squad was dropped, and he 
took over as varsity coach.
He still has that urge to get out 
there and swing his racquet with 
his boys, but since a heart attack 
five years ago, he has been forced 
to concentrate his athletic activi­
ties on his golf game.

Trackmen Bow To Tough
i •Slippery Rock, 77y2~53y2
Worst Dual-Meet Defeat In Six Years For Thinclads
The Tech thinclads in their first track meet of the season todays
did not look like the teams of the past five seasons who won 33 
of 34 dual meets. After losing the final meet in ’55 the Skibos’ 
bid to start a new winning streak was delayed by a powerful Slippery 
Rock contingent. ?----------------------------------------------------------
The Rockets handed the thin­
clads their worst dual meet thump­
ing in the last six years by a score 
of 77%-53^ on Saturday after­
noon.
Coach Carman’s men captured 
six firsts of the 15 events, four of 
which were in the track events.
Arnie Olds, a former Tech distance 
man who just returned from the 
Army, was the bright spot in 
Tech’s attack as he won the two- 
mile relay with a half-lap lead 
over the nearest Slippery Rock 
runner. Swaney and Suggs fin­
ished 1-2 for Tech in the 440 and 
also ran on the winning mile relay 
team. Cramer and Heinecke com­
pleted the winning mile relay 
team.
Two Freshmen Win
Two Skibo freshmen lived up to 
their high pre-season ratings by 
taking firsts in the half-mile and 
pole vault. Carl Templin, a fresh­
man pole vaulter from Mount Leb­
anon, cleared the bar at 10'6" to 
win that event for Tech, while Bill 
Whitman, who lettered on the 
cross country team this past fall, 
lead the half milers across the 
finish line. The thinclads’ other 
first was won by Joe Frick with 
a sparkling 171' javelin throw.
The standouts for Slippery Rock 
were Fennell, who won the 100 
and 220 yard sprints, and Palum­
bo, winner of the high jump and 
broad jump.

sett, and Goetz. The second quar­
ter was a great performance as 
Adams, Goetz, and Cassett contrib­
uted heavily to put the Rockets 
to a comforatble 26-19 lead at 
halftime. The Dukes seemed un­
nerved and unable to work 
smoothly in the first half, and 
were clearly outplayed by the 
R^kets.' Three timely buckets by 
Goetz gave the Rockets their larg­
est lead at the end of the third 
quarter.
The Dukes were also having 
trouble stopping the drives of Ace 
Adams, and fouled him repeatedly. 
Duquesne seemed to be fading out 
of contention toward the end of 
the second, but the scoring of some 
subs kept them alive. The Du- 
qnesne coach must have fired his 
til’m to great heights during the 
intermission before the final quar­
ter, for they came back to per­
form like their immortal Sihugo

EXTRA
In 1952 the Tartan staff threat­
ened to sweep the sweepstakes
with their buggy expected to ex­
ceed'150 m.p.h. because of an in­
novation which came as a result
of a trip to Saturn.
In order to be more loyal to 
CIT, the Tartan staff was report­
ed to be drilling holes in the 
handles of the pushmobile so that 
the wind whistling through the
holes would play “Fight for the 
Glory of Carnegie”. . . .
FJ1HE development of a new airplane such as the Crusader, the World’s Fastest 
Navy Fighter, cannot be credited to any one engineer. Each engineer, how­
ever, is invaluable because this truly new high-performance airplane is only the 
final result of the creative thought and teamwork of a large number of engineers.
The individual ideas of each engineer are most 
important. In aircraft design, the time lag between 
discovery and the utilization of knowledge is 
extremely short, shorter perhaps than in any other 
major industry. The solutions to the most stimu­
lating problems which arise in the industry are 
frequently dependent upon the daily utilization of 
new ideas and new knowledge.
The graduating engineer considering his first 
career decision may choose whether he will enter 
this field of work — the design of airplanes and 
missiles — that progresses hand in hand with new 
discoveries in all facets of science and engineering, 
or choose a less aggressive industry. Of course, it 
follows logically that greater and more rapid ad­
vancement opportunities lie in a field that does not 
stagnate, in a field that is bounded by the creative 
imagination of man alone. At Chance Vought, air­
craft design draws capable engineers to positions 
of greater responsibility in developing new ideas 
and supervising the additional technical manpower 
needed to “practicalize” the ideas. Starting sala­
ries are commensurate with education and expe­
rience for particular specialization and are also 
competitive with other industries as well as 
other companies. Advancement, as one would
expect, is based upon demonstrated performance, 
not seniority.
The future of the aircraft industry is equal to, if 
not brighter than, that of other industries. The 
complexity of modern aircraft and missiles, the 
investigation of new fields of knowledge as air­
craft fly higher and faster, the possibilities of 
man’s further use of science and engineering for 
conquest of the air in the second half of the 20th 
century, all emphasize the challenge and oppor­
tunity to the young graduate.
We urge the graduating engineer to investigate 
these opportunities at Chance Vought. He will 
find a stable, 38-year-old aircraft designer and 
builder with young ideas, a designer and builder 
noted for advancing the state-of-the-art of air­
craft and guided missile design. He will discover 
that Chance Vought offers career opportunities, 
not merely impressive titles, and that he will 
join an engineering organization that thinks 
and operates as a team rather than as a random 
collection of individual engineers.
We have the usual fringe benefits including an ex­
cellent graduate study program, group insurance, 
retirement income plan, paid vacation, sick leave, 
moving allowance, and numerous paid holidays.
We invite you to discuss your opportunities at Chance Vought ivith

It is ^¿ways gratifying to hear 
of a student who has climbed one 
more step to her goal. Miss Lela 
^Iortimer is in this group, since 
she recently received an honor­
able mention award in the art 
contest held by Fisher Scientific 
Company of Pittsburgh. Miss Mor­
timer is a clerk in the warehouse 
department and is a student in 
Mr. Wilson’s evening design class. 
There were 26 paintings and de­
signs exhibited by the workers 
and judged by Mr. Eric Hulmer 
of University of Pittsburgh fine 
Wrts department. Dr. Hulmer stat­
ed that the painting was a “re­
markably realistic picture of a 
Schenley Park lake.” Miss Mortim­
er’s photo appeared on the front 
page of the plant’s publication 
and showed her receiving her 
award. Congratulations and best 
wishes for continued success,

April 8, 1956, by members oi the 
Newman Club. Guests were 30 
boys and girls from St. Paul’s 
Orphanage with Miss Alice Mc­

The children entertained with 
songs and dances and then Mr. 
William J. Kurstedt showed seven 
or eight cartoons which everyone 
enjoyed. Ice cream, milk, and 
cookies were served, and each 
child received an Easter basket 
filled with toys and candies.
Miss Dolores Neff did a good 
job of getting a variety of toyS 
and candies for each youngster. 
Mrs. Emily Muhic made scapu­
