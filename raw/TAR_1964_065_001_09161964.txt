Wednesday, September 16, 1964 — CARNEGIE TARTAN — Fase 5
'EdäS©rials
An Unscheduled Event
After .a battery of receptions, convocations, dances, meet­
ings, and psychological tests, the Glass of 1968 will begin its 
first day of classes today. Orientation week is just about over; 
yet one perennial activity is yet to come, if it hasn’t already 
^ presented itself.
It’s called an “open-end forum,” and its usually conduct­
ed by one certain type of Carnegie Tech student. It’s easy
to locate him. His lair is just about anywherë . : : a table
in the Skibo snack bar, the counter at the corner drugstore, 
or in any of the dormitory lounges. .
His style is eloquent; notably in front of his personal
band of followers.
His topics of discussion? They vary from the hopeless 
«red tape snafus with which he is confronted each time he 
deals with his department of study, to the.merciless, way in 
which the administration disposes of aid, financial or other­
wise, to-our football team.
His picture of Carnegie Tech is the only gospel, and he 
finds no better devil to preach against than the so-called 
propaganda dished out by the administration during Orien­
tation Week.
By nature his evangelical work is directed to the fresh- 
£ men, the new students on campus, since the upperclassmen 
are either strongly set in their beliefs or are better informed 
. than this self-styléd healer.
The freshmen always listen, partly out of curiosity, often 
out of fear, that they, have been “put on” by officials in Ad­
ministration Hall or by uppërclass mentors.
But the freshmen ought to listen to him, for. they can 
claim a very influential portion of the Carnegie Tech com­
munity. They should listen to him out of consideration, yes, 
because all have a right to be heard. But, they should realis- i tically scrutinize him as a soapbox orator, because in actual­
ity, this is the only platform on which he speaks — his own.
He bemoans parking meters. But 'does he drive to 
school? He lashes out at the trivial reasons given by the Fine 
Arts Council when a student is dropped? But is he con- 
sciencious in his work? Or is he even in Fine Arts? He 
derides Student Congress. But has he ever attended a meet­
ing?
He is free to criticize everything, as we all are. But it’s 
he represents nothing.V
Freshmen are advised to meet this breed- of student. 
They may grow to admire him. Or they may risk his jibes 
by embracing a phase of Carnegie Tech existence and sup­
porting it in word and deed.
Whatever the members of the Class of 1968 decide, it 
will be an important decision.
It may very well mean the difference between a bright 
and successful future here and a bleak and frustrating one.
Infiltrators
Several ingenious freshmen, in an obvious attempt to 
blend in with the upperclasses, intentionally left their 
“dinks” in their rooms, purchased Carnegie Tech sweatshirts, 
and strolled around as if part of the pack. They were im­
mediately spotted as freshmen. Know why?
Who wears. Carnegie Tech sweatshirts? And brand 
new ones at that?

men:'and women of-well above 
average ability, at both the un­
dergraduate and graduate levels. 
We also have a mission to con­
tribute to new knowledge, new 
ideas, new artistic modes of ex­
pression 'through research, and 
other creative scholarly work 
that is done by the faculty and 
by our students.
My second item: our objec- . 
tive for you. in >a nutshell — 
to give you a liberal, profes­
sional education.
What does this mean? It means, 
first of all, a core of liberal, stud 
ies for everyone, so that you un 
derstand our history, our culture, 
the traditions of our free society, 
and the meaning of individual 
freedom, so you have .a chance 
to understand and tackle the so- 
sial, economic, political, and hu­
man aspects of your own pro' 
fessional problems.
Professional Preparation 
Important, of course, above all 
is the preparation of all students 
for a profession that is to do 
something useful in our society.
These two-aims of a good, basic 
liberal education and a fine edu­
cation for a profession to do 
something useful in society are 
not mutually exclusive goals. We 
aim to give all of you a thorough 
understanding of basic principles 
and values and ideas and some 
experience in applying all of 
these, all this basic understanding 
to the solution of problems and 
situations which are new to you. 
We hope to develop in yon 
the habit of learning some­
thing from each experience. 
We hope to convince you ab­
solutely that your formal edu­
cation here at Carnegie Tech is 
but preparation for a whole 
lifetime of education for if you 
do not continue your educa­
tion. mostly by self-education, 
you'll become obsolete.
Professor Stelson, head of our 
civil engineering department, has 
estimated that an engineer will 
become obsolete in ten years if 
lie doesn’t spend some ten to 
twenty per cent of his time af­
ter graduation in further educa­
tion. I think, if you think about 
it you can also believe me, that 
you can become outmoded and 
obsolete as an architect, as a 
painter, musician, actor, or writ­
er too, if >ou do not keep abreast 
of and experiment with new ideas, 
new forms, new inodes of expres­
sion in all of the arts.
My third item: why do some 
students fail at Carnegie Tech? 
At Carnegie Tech, it certainly 
is not from lack of ability.
No one is admitted to Carnegie 
Tech who could not, other things 
being proper, make a success of 
his career. Our study of this leads 
me to a quite firm conclusion that 
primary reasons for failure at 
Carnegie Tech, (and I might say 
that we have a better finishing
percentage than a great many in 
most institutions. More of you, a 
higher percentage of you, will 
graduate in four years than in 
most institutions), are two:
First one, lack of motivation; 
and second, lack of control or 
obtaining the art of self-disci­
pline. =
Motivation and Discipline
can teil you with some as­
surance that a student of aver­
age ability, academically or in the 
way of talent in the arts, can de­
velop . into an excellent scholar 
and have a very successful career 
E he. or .she is properly moti- 
ated and‘if you learn .the .skill 
of disciplining yourself. If you 
have, these, character, traits, you 
can do a first rate job as a scholar 
here - at Carnegie Tech, and you 
can also take ah active part. in.
’ . extracurricular .activities, 
I’d say, including finter-collegiate 
and intramural .athletics.
Item four: how can you make
¦ the most of your opportunities?
I think the answer is pretty 
obvious.-You should have defi­
nite goals toward which you 
are highly motivated. And then 
you should discipline yourself 
in the planning and use of 
your time and energy toward 
attaining those goals. If you 
can do this you have become 
.. skilled in the art of self-dis­
cipline. You can lay out your 
week, dccide what you want 
to do and you'll stick to it. 
You’ll do what you know you 
ought to do.
Item five: the importance of 
paying proper attention to dr 
and social behavior. We don’t 
want, at Carnegie Tech, the ad 
ministration to be stuffy about 
this but I do want to assure you 
that we do not consider girls that 
wear skirts as being- queer. And 
we don’t consider men who wear 
a tie and a jacket as being queer.
I think some of you have seen 
the artists in Greenwich Village 
and other artist colonies dressed 
in a bizarre fashion or exhibit­
ing unusual behavior may have 
the idea that if you copy them 
you’ll be a more creative, suc­
cessful artist — the more un­
conventional y.o u are in your 
dress and behavior.
I think I could make a good 
case for the fact that some of 
our most creative, most success­
ful alumni from the Fine Arts 
College have been quite conven­
tional in their dress and be­
havior.
In like manner, I’d like to say 
to the entering engineering stu­
dents that you shouldn’t be de­
ceived by pictures of engineers on 
construction jobs in Alaska or 
any other place. That this 
shouldn’t lead you to the assump­
tion that ycu’ll be a better en­
gineer if you go without a tie or 
a jacket, or if you wear a dirty 
shirt or if you don’t shave or if 
you don’t take care to have mud 
rather than polish on your shoes.
Our Professor Schmertz in av- j 
chitecture, who I think retires 
this year, has a delightful sense 
of humor and maybe you have 
already heard him or you will 
hear him sing some of the bal­
lads that he composes. He’s been 
a member of our campus deisign 
committee, and some couple years 
back when we were in the midst 
of building new buildings and 
plans for still additional buildings, 
he came up with this statement 
one day. He said- — he didn’t 
say, Mr. President — he said 
“Jake, Carnegie Tech is gelling 
to be a very classy place.”
I think probably those of us 
who have been here a long time

Classes Opened 
On Jewish Holiday
Editor, the Tartan:
Today is. the first day of classes 
at Carnegie Tech. It is also Yom 
Kippur, as stated on the official 
college calendar and known by all 
Jewish students.
Yom Kippur, “the day of atone­
ment/’ is the most important of all 
Jewish holidays. Synagogue Serv­
ices are' attended during “most of 
the day and there is fasting' from 
dawn.to sundown!
And at Carnegie Tech Jews 
must sacrifice a first day of classes 
and assignments in order to uphold 
the traiditions of their religion.
. Upperclassmen recognize how 
much subject matter may be cov­
ered in one class period. They 
know the’ disadvantage of coming 
to class unprepared for the next 
lesson. Freshmen don’t know what 
to expect during their first day of 
college classes. They don’t want 
to start school “on the wrong foot” 
and yet. . . their religion . . . their 
parents . . . their conscience . . • 
They have to choose. .
At a school where religious ac­
tivity is encouraged, should not 
religious tradition be respected?
Since the holiday did fall bn 
such an early date and the school 
does have a sizeable Jewish popu­
lation, the administration might 
have delayed the first day of 
classes to September 17-, Students 
could have' registered on Tuesday 
and Wednesday. Special provi­
sions are made at other schools, 
Syracuse University, for example.
I wonder why there was such a 
lack of sympathy and respect 
shown here at Tech. An admin­
istration should be aware of the 
effects which, its decisions have on 
public rellations and on the stu­
dent body. I feel that they used 
very poor taste in beginning 
classes in such an important holi­
day. In future years they should 
study the matter more carefully.
Name withheld
think Bob Schmertz is right and 
that probably as classy as Car­
negie Tech has now become that 
real beatniks don’t really look in 
place here.
I think that you should re­
member that you represent Car­
negie Tech to our neighbors, 
around the campus and also out 
of town and I hope you will 
not do things that will bring 
harm to the relatively good rep­
utation at least that Carnegie 
Tech has worked very hard to 
earn in this community.
We like to let our students 
manage their own affairs to the 
extent that they will tak respon­
sibility for protecting the good 
name of Carnegie Tech. But I 
think when students behave in 
a manner that jeopardizes our 
good relation with the community, 
with the parents of your students, 
with our alumni, that then we 
have to step in and meet our 
basic responsibility which of 
course couldn’t give away to any­
body even if we wanted to.
Set Good Example 
I suggest that in dress and be­
havior that you endeavor to set 
a good example to the upper­
classmen at Carnegie Tech. You 
have to remember that at least 
the seniors started here when 
Carnegie Tech was not as classy 
a place as it is today.
I hope you’ll be friendly ©n 
the campus and that when other 
people, including the president, 
pass you and say “Good morn­
ing” that you’ll respond. 
Respeet Property 
I’d like to say a word next 
about the importance of respect­
ing Carnegie Tech property and 
the property and rights of your 
fellow students. Carnegie Tech. 
has spent a lot of money in the 
last decade to provide excellent 
facilities, I think, for your edu­
cation, for your recreation, for 
your living, and for your social 
life. I think we’ve provided —* 
we’re beginning to provide —• a 
beautiful campus: I hope that

pus. The first three-year class 
(we had a three year curriculum 
in those days) graduated in 1908. 
Mr. Carnegie, the founder, the 
man responsible for our original 
building and our original endow 
ment, visited the’ campus five 
times before. he died. The last 
time was in October of 1914, just 
before World War I. Mr. Carnegie 
died in August of 1919.
I’m the fourth Carnegie Tech 
president. We seem to hang on 
for a long time at Carnegie Tech. 
Where the average tenure of col­
lege presidents in America is 
somewhere around five or six 
years, here we had the first pres­
ident, Hammerschlag, from 1903 
to 1922, 19 years.. Dr. Thomas 
Baker followed him for fourteen 
years, from 1922 to 1936. Dr. Rob­
ert Dougherty followed Baker as 
the third president from 1936 to 
1950. I became president in 1950. 
1 came to Carnegie Tech in 1926 
as a young instructor in physical 
chemistry, so ihis is my 39th year 
at Carnegie Tech and my 15th 
year as president.
We .haye portraits of the first 
three presidents in what we call 
the Highlander Room, in Skibo. 
This is the room, some-of you al­
ready visited it, as they sat at 
Carnegie Tech where they hang 
the presidents. I understand that 
I’ll-.be hung there in a few 
months.
Carnegie Tech is a good, sound 
institution — it holds a tremend­
ous amount of good will among 
the people who can continue to 
help it in the future.
Not Less Than Good
have made the estimate to 
our trustees and to a lot of other 
people that today Carnegie Tech 
is not less' than good in any ac­
tivity that it undertakes; in other 
words, every curriculum that we 
offer — it is really front-rank in 
ight kind of leadership in the 
quite a number; that with the
next ten years» Carnegie Tech c«in 
become really front-rank.in e\<.i> 
field to which it is devoted.
You camé to a first rate insti­
tution with a good faculty, you’ll 
undoubtedly have' your troubles, 
your frustrations, but I hope you 
will determine to make a success 
of your college career.
I wish you the very best of 
luck and I admonish . you very 
strongly not to let things get 
fouled up. If you have troubles, 
if you have difficulties, if you find 
things are getting so complicated 
that you really think you under­
stand the problem, I hope that 
you will do something about it. I 
hope you’ll see someone —- one of 
your professors, someone in Dean 
Brown’s division, or if you can’t 
get satisfaction from any of these 
people, that are supposed to do 
this kind of a job, come and see 
the president.

Tartans Recruit 19; 
Predict A Good Year
By Seott MeCcrmieh
Head coach Joe Gasparella has accomplished something 
that no Tech coach has done in a number of years. He has 
recruited a large number of freshman football players. By 
selling himself and Carnegie’s academic program, Coach 
Gasparella enlisted nineteen freshmen who reported early
to football camp for practice. It*---------------------------------------------------------
js also expected that when the 
season begins, about twenty more 
men will report to the practice 
field.
This should help solve the Tar­
tan's biggest problem of the past 
few seasons — lack of depth. Car« 
negie lost several games last year 
in the last quarter when the four­
teen of fifteen regulars became 
tired and just couldn’t match the 
opposition’s two or three platoons;
Things should be different this 
year.
Fourth Quarter Difference
The quality of the personnel 
•will be the same. The - difference;
•will come iri the fourth 'quarter 
when the Tartans still have their 
wind.
Coach Gasparella’s pro-style 
offense will be run by senior cap­
tain Paul Wisniewski, who alter­
nated at quarterback last year 
with Terry Heckler. At fUliback 
will be hard-running (Smoky 
Merrill who looked very impres­
sive at the inter-squad scrimmage 
on Saturday. This is Smoky’s 
third year at the fullback slot and 
with sophomore Dave Gilchrest at 
the running halfback position, the 
Tartans should have a good inside 
running game. The outside run­
ning will not be as good as last 
year with the graduation of 
speedy A1 Abies, Carnegie’s lead­
ing ground gainer and Most Val­
uable Player. But Merrill and 
Gilchrest, with two freshmen,
Chuck Zak and John Barth, 
should be enough to keep any de­
fense honest.
Passing Game Improved
Carnegie’s passing game will be 
improved. “Whiz” Wisniewski is 
a good passer, and he will have 
six good targets to throw to. The 
split end will be Captain Dave 
D’Appolonia, who has held down 
this position for three years. The 
tight end position will be handled 
by either Bill Coleman, George
Metz, or George McGeary. All 
three are first year men, and all 
three are big. Basketball coach 
Mel Cratsley may squirm a bit 
watching Metz and McGeary, two 
of his forwards, playing football; 
but Joe Gasparella won’t be both­
ered one bit.
The flankerback will probably 
be veteran Jim Black. Behind 
him and. D’^ppolonia will 
frestiman Nick Lynam.
The offensive line will be 
bigger this year, but it will lack 
experience. Heading the list will 
be captain Pete Mangarella at 
tackle, a veteran who will be 
going both ways, as he did last 
year. At the other tackle spot will 
be freshman - Chuck Herron, an 
all-state high school lineman 
from Michigan.1 Backing up these 
two will be Glenn DeRusha, a 
fast lineman from XJniontown’s 
fine team, and Bill Dengler.
Add Depth
At the guards» Coach Gaspe- 
rella. will have a lot of depth 
even with the loss of Ed Patula 
for the first two games with sev­
eral cracked ribs. Jack Love is 
back at one guard spot and the 
other starter will probably be 
freshman Chuck Kandzxolka. Pete 
Baier has been moved from 
tackle to guard this year, and 
with Bob Schaffer and freshman 
George Vajada, there will be 
quite a bit to choose from.
The starting center will prob­
ably be Jim Huckleberry, an all­
stater from Lancaster, Pa. Back­
ing him up will be a letterman, 
Dave Heil. •
Defense Is Question Mark
Again this year, defense will be 
the big “IF.” With so many fresh­
men playing, Coach Gasparella 
has concentrated primarily on of­
fense, figuring that you have to 
score to win ball games.
D’Appolonia and Coleman will 
probably handle the end positions
Jack and Jill - Cue and Cusbion
Pocket DiHiords For Ladies and Gentlemen
while Mangarella and DeRusha 
will start at tackle. The lineback- 
ing chores will be taken on by
Gilchrest, Huckleberry, Heil, and 
Love.
Pass Defense 
Last year’s Achilles Heel was 
the secondary, and this year’s 
doesn’t seem much better. Two 
freshmen, Barth, and Ken Giene, 
are teaming up with Smoky Mer­
rill on pass defense. They won’t 
be very strong at the beginning 
of the season, but they should im­
prove with each game. It didn’t 
take thé opposition olng to find 
the holes in the secondary last 
year, and this year they will be 
looking in the same place.
A |L.ot of Passing
The Tartans will be an exciting 
team to watch. The football will 
be up in the air more often than 
not, since Carnegie’s strength wili 
be their aerial game, and their 
weakness will be pass defense.
With so many freshmen figur­
ing in the Tartan’s football plans^ 
there will no doubt be a lot of' 
mistakes made at the beginning 
of the season, especially against 
veteran teams like Westminster. 
But as the season progressés, the 
freshmen and other new players 
will mature, and so will the team. 
This is a building year for Tech, 
but none the less, it should be a 
better year.
Good Job of Recruiting 
Coach Joe Gasparella has done 
a great job of recruiting freshmen 
players and this recruiting will 
pay off in a few more victories 
than last year's lone win over 
Franklin and Marshall. F. and M. 
should fall again, as should W. 
and J. and quite possibly Wooster 
and Case Tech.
The opener this Saturday with 
the Westminster Titans will be 
a tough one, but the Tartans al­
ways play well against Westmin­
ster. A victory this Saturday 
would be quite an upset but it has 
happened before.

The- intramural athletic program at Carnegie Tech is 
designed to give the student ample opportunity to participate 
in his favorite sport at a high level of competition. At the
same time it gives the fraterni-^------7---------^-------:-------------------------------
ties, the rest of the student body.
and the graduate students a bat­
tle. ground upon which to com­
pete for trophies and - MVP 
awards. As the incoming fresh­
men will soon discover, campus 
interest in this program runs un­
usually high, and championship 
contests are frequently played to 
standing-room-only crowds.
The man responsible ior the 
behind the. scenes action in this 
program is Eugene L. Boyer; Di­
rector Intramural Athletics. He is 
assisted by an Intramural Board, 
whose membership rotates each 
year, and by the Manager’s Club; 
which is composed of one repre­
sentative from each team.
The major sport on the fall 
program' is t o u'c h football, al­
though tennis, co-rec volleyball, 
soccer, and table tennis draw an 
unusually large number of par­
ticipants; Teams may be entered 
in the -program by. fraternities, 
graduate students, commuters, de­
partments, dorms, clubs and any 
other group interested in partici­
pating in a highly - competitive 
athletic program. For those who 
are interested in having a little 
relaxation and fun at the same 
time, each major sport usually 
has a -jag league in which the 
emphasis is a little more on the 
lighter side rather than on win­
ning.
There is very little involved 
in forming a team. Just get up 
enough men to form a team, get
• an entry blank from the intra­
mural office, and you’re in busi­
ness. The entry fee for dormi­
tory residents is paid by Domi 
Council.
Freshmen interested in more 
details of Tech's intramural pro­
gram may contact Mr. Boyer at 
his oflice on the first floor • of 
the gym. With the tremendous 
interest displayed in the program 
last year, I.M. officials this year 
are preparing for the largest pro- 
Cnm in the hi"tory of the school.

Lettermen Chosen To Perform 
At Homecoming Week-End Concert
Firebug Flees 
Blaze At Dorm
by Joe Califf -
Residents of Donner Hall. saw 
an arsonist escaping, up the hill 
behind the dormitory following an 
explosion at 10:40 p.m. Friday. 
Below, a pile of gasoline-soaked 
refuse was dicovered on the track 
in flames.
The pile had been placed there 
for a bonfire to be used in the pep 
rally that night. The rally was not 
held at the field because of bad 
weather and a Pittsburgh ordi­
nance' against fires.
The fire was extinguished by the 
Ideal fire department. Security 
Police were unable to catch the 
person believed to have started 
the fire.
Tech Registers 
846 Freshmen
by Marilyn Fox
Eight hundred and forty-six 
freshmen have registered for the 
fall semester of 1964.
^ According to Mr. Kenneth Wen­
ger, Dean of Admissions, approx­
imately 75 per cent of them are 
from the eastern states. Many 
new students are from California, 
Arizona and Wyoming.
There are 401 freshmen regis­
tered in Science, 240 in Fine 
Arts, 194 in Margaret Morrison, 
and 11 in Industrial Management, 
^ according to William L. Rogers, 
Registrar.
In the freshman class, there are 
about a dozen National Merit 
Scholars and ten George Westing- 
house Scholars.
Few students are in Engineer­
ing and Science with SAT scores 
below 500 (verbal) or below 600 
(math), according to Wenger. Of 
® the new E & S students, 95 per 
cent graduated from the top 1/5 
of their high school classes.
Need Of Administrator
Stifles Drama Center
Plans for construction of the proposed Dramatic Arts 
Center have been brought to a temporary standstill due to 
the lack of an administrative head for the Department of 
Drama.
The former head of the depart­
ment, Dr. Robert Corrigan, had 
resigned last spring. He is . now 
a professor at New York Uni­
versity and editor of Nation Mag­
azine. Professor Earl Gister is 
the acting head of the drama 
department.
As a result, problems in build­
ing design, space, programming 
and future adaptability are yet 
to be resolved.
' One million dollars of the nec­
essary three and a half million 
dollars has already been obtained 
for the building.
The former plan was to re­
quest bids at the end of Feb­
ruary, but it is doubtful that this 
can be accomplished.
. The Dramatic Arts Building is 
the last project slated for com­
pletion under the Carnegie Ex­
pansion Program begun in 1957.
Freshmen Stage Rebellion;
Traditions Test Futile
by Evan M. Melhado
Carnegie Tech freshmen staged a rebellion against the 
Traditions Test which was held at 11 a.m. Saturday morning 
in Skibo Gym.
The first sign of discontent oc­
curred at 6 a.m. Saturday when 
a small group of freshmen paint­
ed the senior fence. They wrote: 
“Violets are blue, Roses are red, 
Forget the Traditions Test, Stay 
in bed/’
Scimitars, the proctors of the 
test, had taken precautionary steps 
to prevent a freshman uprising. 
The test was held indoors at 
Skibo Gym to prevent freshmen 
from building a bonfire with the 
tests. This was done last year.
Scimitars also sneaked the tests 
into the gym through the back 
door to prevent their being in­
tercepted and destroyed enroute.
The freshmen filed orderly in­
to the gym and took their places
on the floor. A few, however, 
stomped their feet and felled as 
the tests were passed out.
After the exams were dis­
tributed, one freshman jumped 
up and blew a whistle. This was 
the signal. Everything broke into 
chaos as the freshmen began to 
tear and scatter the tests.
Scimitars steered the rebelling 
freshmen out of the building to 
prevent damage to the gym equip­
ment. They also made one at­
tempt to retaliate by throwing a 
freshman into Westinghouse Pond. 
This failed.
Following the rebellion, which 
lasted about forty-five minutes, a 
group of freshmen gathered at the 
senior fence.
Perlis Named 
To Committee
by Jane Schoenfcld
Dr. Alan Perlis, Professor of 
Mathematics and director of the 
computation center at Carnegie 
Tech, has been appointed to serve 
on a committee for automatic lan­
guage processing. The appoint­
ment came through the National 
Academy of Sciences’ National 
Research Council.
Serving with Dr. John R. Pierce 
of the Bell Telephone laborator­
ies, Dr. Perlis will work with 
linguists, mathematicians, and 
computer specialists to study the 
application of electronic compu­
ters in the automatic processing 
of language data. In addition, he 
will be concerned with the me­
chanical translation of foreign 
languages, automatic abstracting, 
indexing and scanning of foreign 
language texts, and -developing 
equipment for photo composition.

Editorials
Longer Library Hours Needed
A student is here at Carnegie Tech for any number of 
reasons; but we will optimistically assume that he is here 
primarily for ah education.
He who seeks higher education must be willing to devote 
his efforts, his time, his concern to knowledge, to study, to 
thought. Given such a student — and we have many here 
at Tech — it is the responsibility of a college to provide 
him with every opportunity to learn. This is, indeed, a fun­
damental purpose of a university. _
It is the library which should function as the central 
core of any college which honestly strives to fulfull this 
purpose. .
Where else can a student go for the materials and for 
the solitude necessary for his studies? The ‘wealth of infor­
mation available at the Hunt Library enables students to 
prepare themselves adequately for any academic course, for 
any lecture or discussion. This is not, however, the only 
function of a library. -
Instruction and class discussion are vitally important in 
the search for knowledge, but educators and psychologists 
will attest to the fact that independent discovery is also one 
of the most meaningful elements in the learning process. And 
the place where the student should be able to pursue his own 
academic interests, his own ideas, the answers to his own 
questions, should be the library. The facilities are there.
The’crucial issue is, are the facilities there when the 
student needs them?
The answer is, unfortunately, NO.
According to the present schedule, the Hunt Library is 
opened week-days from 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturday, 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. and Sunday, 2 to 10 p.m. These hours are only ade­
quate when one wishes to complete short assignments, or 
plans some quick studying during free hours.
But these hours do not provide amply study time for the 
student whose schedule requires that intensive work be done 
in the morning before classes, or as most often happens, in 
the evening.
The plight of the evening school student must also be 
' considered. He needs the library when his classes are over, 
often at 9 or 10 at night.
A proposed schedule, one which would comply with the 
needs of such students, is as follows: Monday through Friday 
from 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and 
Sunday, 2 to 10 p;m.
The early week-day hours would enable many students 
to put in some solid work- before classes begin: those two 
hours from 7:30 to 9:30 could be invaluable to a students 
whose schedule begins at 9:30 and is full throughout the day. 
An extension of the opening hour was instituted last year 
with which students proved their interest in early studying. 
(Just look around the Reserve Room at 8:15 in the morning.)
The benefits of longer evening hours need not be enum­
erated. Students study long after 9 p.m. Why shouldn’t study 
facilities accommodate them?
The time for change is now, before the school year rou­
tine is irrevocably established, and the search begins for a 
place to study when the time for studying is right!

and even the government of

to be clarified.

Politics
Goldwater Theory Seen 
To Need Glorification
1»; James Fanepinift
Two of the drawbacks in studying Conservatism is the 
lack of a concrete definition and the general misunderstand­
ing of the term. Senator Goldwater, the GOP candidate for 
for President, points out in "The^ } : : ~ 7
Conscience of a Conservative” 
that many people, even some pro­
fessing the conservative point of 
view, have a mistaken notion of 
Conservatism.
This fact deems necessary the 
study of not only Senator Gold­
water’s views, but those of con­
servative thinkers bafore him. To 
reach this end, I will draw on the 
writings of other conservatives 
and try to present a “composite” 
view of Conservatism.
First of all, one must under­
stand the . nature of man in or­
der to adapt a political phil­
osophy which will serve him best.
Man is basically an evil 
creature, and his wickedness 
and irrationality must be held 
in chcck by the restraints of 
an orderly society. To attain 
this society, an aristocracy 
ust rule the people,, beeping 
in mind that ¿quality is sec­
ondary to liberty.
The rights of man must be 
earned — even the inalienable 
rights òf the Constitution — by 
the performance of certain du­
ties. “Service, effort, obedience, 
cultivation of virtue, self- 
straint,” all are the price, of 
rights according to Rossiter.
To conservatives, the solu­
tion to problems is not pur­
poseful reform, but reliance on 
the simple, instinctive acts of 
traditionalism and preservation.
Education — family, church, 
and school — is stressed as 
the main way in which chil­
dren can be' shaped into civi­
lized men. This outside influ­
ence upon man is the “only” 
way in which man's vices can 
be brought under control.
The conservative also arrives 
at desired views of man, society, 
and government. A good man 
self-disciplined, reverent, prudent, 
patrotic, and contented. A good 
society is orderly, united, equal, 
stable, secure, harmonious, and 
changes only when absolutely 
necessary. A good government is 
dignified, legitimate, just, con­
stitutional, hierarchal, a ri'd has 
limited powers. Conservatism is 
all this: a temperment, a mood, 
a philosophy, and a tradition.
Senator's Goldwater’s ideas 
on Conservatism are much the 
same as the previous conser­
vatives, but one important dif­
ference exists. According to 
Senator Goldwater, in . VThe 
Conscience of a Conservative,"
Conservatism, takes into ac­
count the wholeness of man’s 
nature. It accounts for both the 
spiritual and material sides of 
man's nature. Realizing both of 
these extremes, allows the con­
servative .to rationalize the 
presence of both individuality 
and equality.
The mortal side of man’s soul 
establishes his uniqueness while 
all men have an equal chance 
for spiritual immortality. Sena­
tor Goldwatèr states that “man’s 
development, in both its spirit­
ual and material aspects, is not 
something that can be directed 
by outside forces.” This shines 
through as the major premise of 
Goldwater’s argument.
From this can be extended that 
man is solely responsible for 
both his spiritual and material 
needs. This is radically different 
from the reliance of other con­
servatives on education to di­
rect man from virtue to freedom.
Individual freedom will be his 
primary goal, or in his own 
words, “politics as the art of 
achieving the maximum amount 
of freedom for individuals
This is the primary goal of 
Conservatism; however, à con­
flict arises due to his view of 
the nature of man.
Senator Goldwater’s com­
plete denial of the influence 
of outside forces upon man
the Presidency but also; other un­
acceptable conservative beliefs. 
Probably the biggest is the be­
lief that “this is the best of all 
possible worlds,” as Clinton Bos- 
siter phrases, it, and the general 
contention to leave well enough 
alone.
In Voltaire’s “Candide," Can- 
dide’s naive belief that this is 
the best of all possible worlds is 
satirically destroyed. The conclu-, 
sion one comes to is that many 
evils are avoidable, especially 
those caused by ignorance and 
fanaticism, and that change is 
a means to this end.
T h i s contradiction of con­
servative belief, that a dynamic 
society cannot be. treated in a 
static manner, is the major 
. reason why Senator Goldwa­
ter’s theories will not solve the 
problems which our society 
faces.
Dems Hit On Policy
Of Nat’l Values By GOP
by Robert J. Fritz
Depending upon whether you are left wing, right wing, 
or no wing at all, you might describe Barry Goldwater as 
a nuclear madmanj-the savior of our country, or a fool. But 
regardless of who you are, the» 
best description of him is con­
tained in the r word “protest,” a 
protest that was fated to occur 
the day the New Deal' replaced 
Herbert Hoover.
It is easy to. look with some 
nostalgia upon the past—upon the 
heroic pioneer, alone with his 
family in a savage wilderness, and 
the self-sufficient craftsman who 
forged our nation with his brains, 
his hands, and his initiative. Then 
there used to be a certain solemn 
patriotism, on days like the Fourth 
of July, and the flag which was 
resolutely respected, if not liked, 
everywhere on the globe.
Now there are those who fear 
that all our old values have disin­
tegrated,, that “our lives, our for­
tunes, and our sacred honor” are 
in danger of being subjugated by 
a very real form of dictatorship, 
an increasingly complex federal 
government which threatens to 
extend its hand into every facet 
of our lives.
The most vocal of these is 
Barry Goldwater, and his voice 
is chiefly protest. He speaks 
copiously about the so-called 
issues of Viet Nam, Cuba» nu­
clear weapons, and the like. But 
these are only transient issues.
There are two more meaningful 
issues: Must our national values 
change with our technology, and 
should they? The conservatives 
answer, “no,” to both questions, 
and this is the essence of the pro­
test that is Goldwater.
Just how effective this protest 
will be is somewhat question­
able. Unfortunately the “real” 
issues will not play much of a 
part in deciding the election, as 
the Senator’s unpopular image 
alone is enough to ensure his 
defeat in November.
It is becoming ever more ap­
parent that the conservatives, in 
choosing their champion, have by­
passed all the best knights, to 
choose instead the one with the 
loudest voice.
And Lyndon Johnson is a for­
midable foe indeed. His prom­
ises of prosperity go out to all 
men. To the farmer he is the 
drawling log-cabin bom Texas 
rancher. The union worker s>ees 
him as one of the original new 
dealers, and to the businessman 
he shows his kindly paternalis­
tic side.
The Johnson dream is of an 
affluent society in which every­
one is contented and all work to­
gether, and while he has been 
called conservative (among other 
things), he believes that the fed­
eral government is the best agent 
to bring this society about.
Ignoring the conservatives, he 
sees no governmental threat to de­
mocracy, our way of life, -or any­
thing else. Since assuming office 
last November Johnson has been 
extremely effective at getting what 
he wants. In these ten short 
months his popularity has in­
creased to a higher level than that 
of any other president in modem 
history. A Johnson victory is al­
most a foregone conclusion.
Now we are faced with a para­
dox. The. very man who es­
pouses conservatism the most, 
and has finally given the voters 
“a choice, not an echo,” has, by 
his somewhat irresponsible 
statements, his continually 
changing views, and his vote on 
the Civil Rights Bill, among 
other things, doomed the chances 
of conservatism in 1964. Pessim­
ists among conservatives, and 
optimists among liberals, have 
predicted that it will never be 
an issue again. But this Is hard 
to believe.
Our nation has undeniably 
moved toward the left in recent 
years, whether for -better or for 
worse. This has given rise to con­
servatism.
If Johnson wins in 1964, the pro­
test will continue, with or without 
Goldwater. Eventually a conser­
vative with the political cunning 
of Lyndon Johnson will run for 
President. That. election will de­
cide the fate of mankind for a long 
time.

‘Student Government
Is A Catalyst For Action?
by Joseph G, Sandulli 
Chairman of Student Congress 
Is anybody going home for Thanksgiving vacation this 
year? Don't take it for granted; last year the school scheduled 
classes for the Friday following this Thanksgiving. Through 
-negotiation and even promise of a student demonstration, 
Student Congress convinced thç administration to rè-instatè 
Friday after Thanksgiving as a*-----—----------'
- vacation. With a record of this 
kind of action, Student Congress 
attacks another year.
I am pleased to begin this^year 
with a crew of dynamic enthu­
siastic committee heads who will 
actually carry out the doings of 
Congress. Already Dick Elder has 
raised the freshmen to a higher 
^ degree of orientation than ever 
before. We expect “dinks” still 
to be fashionable at Christmas 
time. Dick is, of course, the Ori­
entation Committee Chairman of 
Congress; he has had complete 
responsibility for planning and 
carrying out every orientation 
event following Freshman Camp.
Establish Flans 
At our first Congress meeting 
•on September , 30, we will , begin 
^feto establish plans for this year’s 
action. Mike Gross and Bab Fritz 
of General Campus Committee 
will present their ideas on a new 
school calendar which /would al­
low . us to finish first semester 
by Christmas and second semes­
ter by early May. They will soon 
begin to negotiate for this cal­
endar change.
Our Assembly Committee 
headed by Joe Bowman with its 
new $4,000 'budget (an increase 
of $3,000 over last year) has al­
ready lined up Drew Pearson who 
will analyze the coming presi­
dential election. - Joe is still de­
bating whether he can safely 
bring Ross Barnett to Carnegie 
Tech.^--_
Favorite Project
Of all the new projects, my 
favorite is the idea of our writ­
ing a “Course Critique”: - effec­
tively a course catalogue writ­
ten by the students; Modeled af­
ter such a book published at 
Yale, its intent would be . to de­
scribe courses as the students see 
them; to help students find a 
course and prof better suited to 
their needs; not just to criticize. 
No more people taking “Analysis” 
and expecting a course in psy­
chiatry.
In an attempt to see that Con­
gress more fairly represents the 
student body, our new Elections 
Committee chairman, Dick Lon- 
dergan will be examining the

gress so that all student opinions 
can be heard more easily. Dick 
may also help run a mock elec­

depending upon how active young

Skibo For Students
Elissa Parker and Tom Johnson 
have some marvelous plans for 
making Skibo more cozy, more 
social. They will begin negotia­
tions for ' turning Skibo into a 
place .where one can bring a 
date, and even dance. They want 
more of the space there turned 
back over to the students.
And, of course, there will be 
the things we take for granted 
from Student Congress like Homer 
coming and Spring Carnival. 
Keith . Pierce will be • doing his 
most important work in this next 
month before Homecoming, for 
which he will be completely re-
We try to think creatively and 
to improve continually the status 
of the student on this campus, in 
addition to maintaining all the 
basic necessities of life like big 
weekends and vacations. To per­
ceive what you consider as an 
improvement on campus we must 
maintain good communication 
with the ¡entire student body.
Meetings Open 
If you have an inspiration, con­
tact me and then come to the
next Congress meeting; I will see 
that your idea .is considered. Our 
first meeting is open to everyone 
on campus* Just come to watch, 
or fill out a sheet requesting work 
with one of the .committees. Stu­
dent Congress is no miracle cure 
for your problems^ -
If you have a problem, sign 
up for Congress, and YOU will 
solve the problem. Congress is 
the catalyst for action with its 
budget of $4,200 and its organi­

have the enthusiasm and ability 
to accomplish things.,

S P OR T S
Opener Sees Tech Plummet
Under Mighty Westminister, 39-0
by Ron Bidula
In spite of new uniforms and several new faces in the
lineup for CIT last Saturday at Tech Field, it was the same
old story as far as the football fortunes of Carnegie Tech 
are concerned. The Westminster Titans soundly thrashed the 
Tartans to the tune of 39-0. ? "
Tech simply couldn’t cope with 
the unusual depth in the Titans1 
offensive arid defensive lines.
Tech!s experienced backfield could 
not consistently jell to produce
the long gainers necessary if the
wide-open offense displayed by 
the Techites was to prevail.
- Tech won the toss and elect­
ed to open np their offense on 
their first plays from . scrim­
mage. After D’Appolonia cov­
ered a short kick on his own 
33» Wisniewski tested right 
guard for a short gain before he 
pitched out to Gilchrist around 
right end for four yards and 
then tossed a long but errant 
bomb downfield trying to hit 
D’Appolonia, who had eluded 
the speedy Titan secondary.
Tech was then forced to punt 
from their, 38.
CIT contained the ' cautious 
Titan offense for the moment, 
however, and Westminster punted 
to the Tech 32, where freshman 
Dick Bell gathered in the slip­
pery pigskin and fought his way 
back to the 38. Then the Tech 
offense caught fire for the mo­
ment.
After £n incomplete pass and 
a short gain on a cross-buck by 
fullback Dick Merrill, Wis 
faked to his fullback and threw 
a screen pass to ' sophomore 
halfback, Gilchrist, who scam­
pered 32 yards around left end 
to the enemy's 98. Dave was 
shaken up by a hard tackle, 
however, and was replaced in 
the backfield by frosh John 
Barth.
-The Titans quickly ended any 
hopes for -a quick Tech score, 
however, as they stopped Barth 
for a loss after a pitchout from 
Wis, and then forced the harried 
quarterback to overthrow 
targets twice. On fourth down 
they stopped a Statue of Liberty 
Play for no gain.
Westminster took over with 
8:23 left in the first quarter and 
politely fumbled the ball right 
back to the Tartans on the WM 
38, but Tech still could not 
come up with a score. After 
two pitchouts and a fullback 
plunge over right tackle left 
CIT still short of a first down,
Wis called for a quickie but­
tonhook, but he threw behind 
his receiver and WM took over 
on downs.
After again forcing a Titan 
punt to the CIT 44, Tech mounted 
a sustained drive toward the 
Titan goal line with the hard 
running of Dick Merrill and the 
sure hands of halfback Jim Black 
and D’Appolonia. This threat was 
stymied though when Titan Bob 
Scarazzo intercepted a Wis pass 
on his own 5 and returned it to 
the WM 31. With about a minute 
left in the quarter, that was the 
ballgame as far as the Tech fans 
were concerned.
On the next play Smitty Cor­
nell circled left end to the CIT 
27. The Titans pounded the CIT 
guard and tackle positions until 
Harry James plunged over from 
one yard out with 14:05 left in 
tha second period. The PAT was 
good and the Titans led 7-0.
(Then, after Westminster quick­ly forced Tech to punt to the WM
21, John Bailey, Titan halfback 
from Pittsburgh Schenley, quick­ly cut over left tackle* and outran 
4&e hapless CIT ss.epjidary. for a
Titan score at 11:22. The PAT 
was short, and Tech was now 
trailing 13-0.
Tech returned the kickoff to 
its 38 and gained a first down 
with the hard running of frosh 
Barth. Wis was Shaken up on 
the * next play and freshman 
Tom Hubka took over. Three 
plays later a Gilchrist punt was 
blocked and recovered by WM 
on the CIT 31.
The Titans quickly passed to 
the Tech 5, but the rugged Tech 
forward wall held for four downs, 
only- to see Wis fumble the ball 
back to the enemy oh the next 
play. Bailey quickly scored again 
and WM led 19-0 at 4:18 after the 
PAT failed. Neither team could 
mount a drive in the last four 
minutes of the half as they ex­
changed punts.
The rainsoaked crowd was 
entertained at halftime by the 
Scottish Highland dancing of 
freshman Sarah Jane Erskine 
. and the frosh-soph tug-of-war. 
The weak-kneed freshmen had 
to enlist the aid of the South 
goal post to win their struggle 
and attempted to become the 
first in the bistory of the grid­
iron sport to tear down a goal­
post at'halftime. The sober- 
headed sophomores prevailed, 
though.
CIT kicked off to open the sec­
ond half and WM returned to 
.their 30. On the first play from 
scrimmage Gig Armstrong scoot­
ed around the CIT left end for 
70 quick yards and another Titan 
score at 14:11. The PAT was off 
to the right and CIT was now 
down 25-0.
Tech blockers could no long­
er hold back the onrusliing
Titan defensemen. Gilchrist 
punted on fourth and twenty- 
nine at the CIT 3 and WM re­
turned to the Tech 38. Tech 
fans took heart two plays later 
as Dick Merrill stole a Titan 
aerial on his own 33 and 
hustled all the way to the WM 
30. Two plays later, however, 
Gary Hughes snatched a Wis­
niewski pass on his 30 and ran 
all the way to paydirt for the 
fifth Westminster TD. This time 
the PAT was good" and CIT
trained 32-0 at 7:26.
The Titans again forced Tech to 
punt after only three short run­
ning gains and then ground out
the yardage from their 40 to­
wards the CIT end zone with
halfbacks Haug and Smargiasso 
carrfing the load. As the third 
quarter ended, however, soph 
guard Pete Gair covered a WM 
fumble at the CIT 14. Two plays 
later defensive end Ray Cebula 
plucked a Hubka aerial from the 
hands of a frustrated Tech re­
ceiver and scored the sixth Titan 
TD. WM again split the uprights 
and now led' 39-0 with about 
fourteen minutes left in the 
“game.”
The two teams went through 
the motions as the slick 'field 
and first game mistakes by both 
teams prevented any prolonged 
drive. The Titans continually 
smeared Tech runners for loss­
es as Coach Gasparella was 
now experimenting with an all- 
freshman backfield.
The gloom was thick in the CIT 
lockerroom after the game. Tech 
fans are hoping their discouraged 
gladiators will bounce back 
against Wooster next Saturday.

Frosh Turn 
Tug Into Win
by Bruce Gelio
Tech freshmen won the right to 
remove their “dinks” as. they out- 
pulled the sophomores in the tra­
ditional tug of war last Saturday 
afternoon on the Tech field.
Having successfully revolted 
against the traditions test in the 
morning, the freshmen set out to 
make a clean sweep of the class 
conflict. During half time of the 
Tech-Westminster' football game,' 
the sides gathered at each end of 
the rope, the frosh pulling toward 
the south goalpost.
Making headway from the 
start, the frosh used a new tactic, 
pulling the rope around the up­
right of the goalpost. Both the post 
and the sophomore team gave in, 
with the freshmen, holding the 
dubious title of victors.
1926-Big Year
by .Howard WeissThe 1926 powerhouse team, 
under Coach “Wally” Seffen, 
started off favorably with a 
47-0 romp over Adrian. Then 
we lost a htartbreaker to 
arch-rivals Washington & Jef­
ferson with a score of 17-6, 
but we came back to beat Pitt
14-0 and Detroit 7-0 for the 
city championship.
Powerful N.Y.U. edged us 
6-0 but we rebounded with 
52-0 afid 20-0 victories over 
Juniata and West Virginia, re­
spectively.
Then came the final game of 
the season. The 1925 Rose. 
Bowl winner, N-otre Dame, 
unbeaten in eleven matches 
and coached by Knute Rockne, 
was our foe.
The outcome was the biggest 
upset in football history! The 
Tartans humbled “The Fight­
ing Irish” 19-0.

New Power System Prevents
Future Campus Blackouts
by Michael W.. Vargo
A new electrical power system is being installed at 
.Carnegie Tech which will eliminate the possibility of an­
other blackout like the one of last April 17.
The entire, campus, with the*---------------------------------------------------------
exception of Morewood Gardens
and the fraternity complex, had 
been without electrical power for 
a weekend.
The new system, .to be com­
pleted at the end of November, 
will cost a quarter of a million 
dollars. It will consist of two 
®main circuits running to all the 
buildings on campus; there will 
be a regular A. C. circuit and 
one fail-safe circuit for emergen­
cies.
The main power distribution 
center in Machinery Hall will 
handle an input of 4,160 volts. 
Each circuit will carry 400 amps; 
almost hree times the capacity of 
the old circuits.
new switching manhole, full 
of high-power lines, has been dug 
behind the Fine Arts building. 
The electrical company has ad­
vised all students against explor­
ing and tampering therein.
Since last year’s cave-in of the 
concrete electrical power circuit, 
Tech has been operating on a 
temporary power supply. This 
has been housed in a makeshift 
wooden conduit beside Engineer­
ing Hail.

Kiltie Marching Band Performs
by Cindy Morse
The Fine Arts Department lacks sufficient funds to cover 
their original plans for the proposed Dramatic Arts Center, 
it was stated last Friday by Norman Rice, dean of the 
?College of Fine Arts.
At present he administration is 
working to bring the building to 
a cost the university can support.
According to Rice there is an 
“ambitious scheme” underway to 
meet these needs. However, no 
time table has been set.
Dean Rice added, “we don't 
suffer from lack of leadership in 
the department.” He indicated 
that although each new depart­
ment head comes with new ideas, 
it doesn’t change the plans eatn 
time. (This was in reference to 
last week’s statement that lue 
plans, were stifled because. of a 
need for a permanent administra­
tor,)
The former head of the Drama 
Department, Dr. Robert Corrigan, 
is now a professor at New York 
University and drama critic for 
Nation magazine, not editor, as 
was earlier reported.
The Fine Arts program at Car­
negie Tech _ has been recognized 
by officials as outstanding, but 
crowded.
“The program is better than 
the space?permite,”: cited Rice;
The need for space is the pri­
mary objective in building a new 
Dramatic Arts Center. There is 
inadequate storage space. This 
forces the Department of . Drama 
to destroy sets after they have1 
been used, for there is no place to 
keep them. '
The shop space is limited and 
the sets must be constructed on 
stage, creating another problem.
There is also a great need for a 
separate theater for music, due to 
the fact that while the sets are 
under construction, the stage can 
not be used for other perform­
ances.
All these deficiencies are hoped 
to be rectified upon the future 
completion of the Dramatic Arts 
Center.

The 72-piece Kiltie Marching Band made its debut Sat­
urday during half-time at the' Tech-Wooster football game.
The first theme was the New York World's Fair. The 
band presented marching .forma-* 1
tions showing the New York ele­
vator and Swiss skyride.
The half-time pageant was ar­
ranged by Edward Maddon, who 
was affiliated with Boston College 
and had formerly arranged for 
such jazz artists'.as Stan Kenton 
and Buddy Morrow.
Dr. Richard E. Strange, band 
director, prepares the format and 
formations for halftime shows.
Student Congress allocations, 
which finance the arrangements, 
are sufficient his year to provide 
a different show for each home 
game.
'The October 3 game with Case 
Tech will be an invitational band 
day, in which the Kilties will be 
joined by bands from Case Tech,
North Hills, and Wilkifisburg
High Schools for a specialty of 
massed brass sections.
At he Homecoming Game with 
Grove City, he halftime show will 
honor the Freshman Homecoming 
Queen.
The Kilties will travel to Lan­
caster, October 24, on an invita­
tion by Franklin & Marshall to 
play for their Homecoming week­
end.
The following week, a pageant 
based on the forthcoming elec­
tions will be presented for the 
Tech-Denison contest.
At the .last game, in which we 
play the University of Rochester, 
the pageant will honor , the state 
of Pennsylvania, the city of Pitts­
burgh and Carnegie Tech.

Woo9ter football game.
They are Roberta Wesolak, 
Cheryl Speare, and. Marsha Mall, 
all freshman; Jeanie Garaux and 
Mimi Eakins, juniors, and Barbara 
Johnson, a senior.
Twenty-one had competed for 
the team.
Cheers Sought
The Carnegie Tech Cheerlead­
ers are seeking suggestions for 
new cheers this season.
In the past, Carnegie Tech 
cheers have been dubbed old- 
fashioned, high-schoolish, or lack­
ing in “pep.” The cheerleaders 
feel that Carnegie Tech’s student 
body with their many “astute 
and original ideas" may be able 
to help them formulate new 
cheers.
Anyone with suggestions can 
drop them in suggestion boxes in 
Skibo and Administration Hall.

Editorials
However much ¿the .quality ©f a Tech .education is 
stressed, Carnegie jnxtsl also fulfil] American expectations oi 
jquaaffiby in its teaching progj-ams.
With these ..demands ®i gnantity on a31 educations] in-, 
ftitutions, schools must overcome the scheduling problems 
quantity carries -with it. Csjnogie administrators must or­
ganize daily and weekly -class sdhediales -as wel! as plan a 
saMsfactoiy y.eafily calendar i/o .suit coHege standards.
On both scheduling levels, Tech has satisfied the require­
ments, but tihe Carnegie Calendar «fioes not represent the best [ 
possible effort for the .year’s planning.
The ealendai' kad remained essentially mic-hanged in 
major areas £or ±00 long. WMLe Pitt and many other col-: 
leges and ¡universities laaye gone to trimester plans, others 
have gone to .a quarters system, and Pennsylvania and others; 
have just shuiSed their two semesters around somewhat,! 
Tech lias .done nothing.
It is mot necessary for Tech t® adopt the radical tri­
mester 4>r quarters system—indeed it -would be a mistake 
"to do so bow. Many oi She mstitutlons on these mew systems: 
are dissatisfied with the results and are trying to succeed m 
an area already strevna with discontent and foolishness.
Pennsylvania is not dissatisfied with these .sliuffled two 
semester programs ihey initiated a few years .ago in their 
“Penn S" Calendar.. Briefly., tibeir -system is characterized 
fey:
1. Almost complete pre-registration with final details 
arranged on the Tuesdays after Labor Day.
2. Tbs first term begins on the Wednesday after l.abor 
Day..
3. Class itime is slightly lengthened.
4." 'Hie term is fourteen weeks long and ends on about 
December 23,
5. There are no .extensive finals and the Christmas 
vacation is the semester break and is therefore slight­
ly longer.
6. After the break, the second term begins and continues
for sixteen weeks, untS! early May.
To establish their calendar, Pennsylvania violated the 
requirements of the engineering council {the E.P.C.D.) — 
with a fourteen week first term. Accredited engineering 
schools must have fifteen week terms. They put a heavy 
strain on registration in one day as well as cramming an 
entire term between Labor Day and Christmas with no 
major breaks. They eliminated finals, which many courses 
relied on, and ihey moved classes further into the early 
September ¿ays.
In all .of these areas Pennsylvania was causing har,d 
feelings by changing and Tech would faee these same argu­
ments if a plan similar to the “Penn B” Calendar were 
adopted. But Penn’s positive arguments outweighed their 
reservations as do similar reasons for Tech’s considering a 
change,
1. The fifteen week requirement of the EPCD was 
bridged by Penn’s arguments that their second term com­
pensated for the deficiency. This, with slightly longer class 
hours and their belief that very few classes really would 
suffer in quality or quantity of education, negated the 
council’s threat to them.
2. Penn freed Christmas vacations of the apprehension 
of coming finals in courses they were disconnected from at 
home. It made the recess a freer period and more of a vaca­
tion, while allowing administration much more time to plan 
and prepare for a new term.
3. Classes did not drag into warm weather when other 
college students were already out and on the labor market 
for summer jobs. Even the earlier start did not hurt them 
for Labor Day always had been a natural stepping point for 
summer work and yacations.
4. Penn eliminated finals which had been as much en­
durance trials as those ending each Tech term.
Tech can adopt these same arguments and although 
they are by no means open and shut, they provide a starting 
point for students, faculty, and administration consideration. 
The changes might allow time for two hour finals and vaca­
tions might be altered for an acceptable plan. Freshmen 
Orientation might be set the week before Labor Day with 
little hardship, otherwise the better opportunities for 
summer jobs, the freer Christmas vacation, and the compact­
ness of the plans would be easily applied to the Tech needs..
A few years ago, the faculty Calendar Committee under 
Dean Brown, made an extensive survey of the Calendar 
and decided the current plan v/as as good as any. Their 
survey might have missed the “Penn B” proposal and it did 
miss the student opinions on the subject completely. Now, 
the General Campus Committee of the Student Congress is 
beginning a study of the Calendar proposals. They have am­
munition on both sides and with a thorough study, starting 
at the Student Congress meeting, they can decide on a work­
able and acceptable solution to Tech’s calendar.
The Calendar for 1965-66 is already passed, but it is not 
too soon to look at 1966-67, the junior year for the new 
freshmen.

Editor, The Tartan:

port- Lyndon Baines Johnson, s 
•candidate of contradictions? John- 
son ran on two very different plat­
forms in 1960—The National Dem­
ocratic Platform and the State 
Democratic Platform of Texas.
His National Democratic Plat- 
zorm .called for further centraliza­
tion £>f the Federal Government; 
•at the BsLme time he xan for the 
Texas Senate on a state platform 
Hhat denounced “the growing and 
Tnpnarn^ concentration of power 
in the .central government.”

~hiiR .state program condemned 
medicare .as a “socialistic propo­
sal.'”
Johnson promised school ..deseg­
regation in the 19.60 national cam­
paign while at the same time he 
•promised to protect the wishes of 
the people of local school districts 
in t3ae opei «tion of their schools.
Whilp Johnson was a member 
of the House and Senate between 
1942 and i960, lie voted against 
.outlawing the poll tax 12 times. 
Now be supports the new enti- 
poli tax amendement.
The 1.960 National Democratic 
platform favored sit-in demonstra­
tions. 333s state senate platform 
favored "enforcement of laws de­
signed lo protect private property 
from physical occupation.”
On November 27, 1.963, he said: 
“ We have talked long enough in 
this country about equal rights. 
It is time now to write the next 
chapter and to write it in the 
book >of law,” But the Texas Ob- 
server .quoted him as saying; ^Tfais 
civil rights pr.qgram . ... is 2 farce 
and a -sham—an .effort to set up a 
police state in the guise of liberty. 
I .am opposed „ to that program. I 
fought it in Congress. I am op­
posed to the anti-lynching bill be- 
.cause the federal government has 
no more business enacting a lav/ 
against one form of murder than 
.another/'
It is .obvious that Lyndon Baines 
J.ohnsoD is running on a platform 
of hypocrisy.

To Whoever was responsible for 
the front-page article about Fresh­
man Camp (September 16):
For shame! How could you al­
low such a shameful article to be 
printed? Where is your pride in 
doing a good job?
To begin with, how could you 
ignore giving recognition to the 
co-chairman of Freshman Camp, 
April Soule? How could you be 
so thoughtless?
Second- how could you be so in­
accurate with detail? Dramats Did 
NOT put on the skits. The coun­
selors did! And the counselors did 
not just POSE questions to be dis­
cussed, but worked hard and long 
on an exceptional intellectual and 
enlightening program. And the 
counselors did not TRY to arouse 
spirit, like it was a dying animal 
Your sentence seemed to negate 
the fun at Camp. And for further 
reference, there in only ONE 
Scoltie Dog.
Third, may I say, in the most 
polite words that I can, that the 
choice of picture under the title 
of the article was indeed damning 
I doubt whether Mr. McCabe's 
speech or any other facet of Camp 
could have bored anyone. Maybe 
someone on your staff a
strange sense of humor.
Fourth, the whole tone of the 
article would make a reader, un-

Politics
Liberalism: Compared
Explained, And Applied
by James Panepinto
Liberalism. like Conservatism, is misunderstood by 
many Americans.
To shed light on this point, I recently took a survey in 
downtown Pittsburgh and acquired the following results:
Q. Do Liberals eventually want
to abolish established churches? 
A. Seven said “no,” 11 said “yes.”
Q. Do liberals generally advo­
cate more reforms than Conserva­
tives? A. Ten said “no.” eight said 
i‘yes.“
Q. Is the ultimate goal of Lib­
eralism to produce a Socialist 
state? A. Four said J‘no,” 14 said 
‘‘yes ”
These and other questions were 
asked to both male and female 
adults on the comer of Smithfield 
and Forbes Street in downtown 
Pittsburgh. This survey had its 
limitations, but I think cne can 
safely generalize that many have 
mistaken notions about Liberal­
ism.
To understand Liberalism as a 
political philosophy, one should 
first comprehend the liberal’s 
view of the nature~of man.
Liberalism, unlike Conserva­
tism, does not view man as a 
wicked, essentially irrational 
creature in need of many re­
straints, but rather as an ignor­
ant, rational being in need of 
knowledge. Liberalism, as an 
attitude toward life,' is more 
skeptical, experimental, ration­
al, and free than Conservatism 
Instead of binding the individ­
ual with he restraints of so­
ciety, church, and tradition, be ‘ 
is set free to increase his sum 
of knowledge and to strive for 
enlightenment in order to cre­
ate a good society.
Basically then, ihe Liberal 
wants progress. Only by his own 
efforts can man create himself a 
beter life on earth.
Concerning government J. 
Schapiro. in “Liberalism: Its
Meaning and History.” points out 
that *‘in the liberal view, the chief 
end oi government is to uphold 
the liberty, equality, and security 
of all citizens/’ This government 
has to be dynamic according to 
the way in which Liberalism is 
defined. Progress will be achieved 
in this government through re­
forms. However, these reforms 
are not the product of extremism.
The liberal temper blends 
•idealism with practical consid­
eration. Ideals are to serve as
guides to ultimate ends. These 
are to be attained, not all at 
once but one by one, cautious­
ly, moderately, yet continuous- 
ly, Time, place and history de­
termine the pace as well as the 
method of progress. As Scha­
piro points out, the liberal way 
is the way of the “inevitability 
of gradualness” in the progress 
of mankind.
It is the general consensus cf 
the public that President Johnson 
is a liberal. However, one may 
ask how President Lyndon John­
son fits into the picture of Lib­
eralism that has been described.
President Johnson has made 
his reputation in politics as an 
adjuster of conflicting political 
viewpoints and pressures, and 
as a manipulator of people to 
gain his objectives in politics. 
The President was an ardent 
New Dealer, whose first job in 
federal service was as head of a 
youth organization in the 
thirties.
The record indicates that Presi­
dent Johnson shifts views on par­
ticular issues. He had opposed a 
federal civil-rights law before 
and yet he literally carried the 
recent bill through Congress. His 
views on union power have also 
been extremely variant.
For the most part, President 
Johnson believes federal policies 
and programs have been success­
ful and should continue to ex­
pand.
It is clear that President 
Johnson isn’t a “clear-cut” lib­
eral, or at least he keeps this 
part of himself extremely well- 
concealed. He expounds no lib­
eral theories and hi« methods of 
accomplishing his goals are not 
liberaL However, it appears 
that many of his goals are with 
liberal intentions (civil-rights. 
anti-poverty bill, foreign aid)* 
even though they appear hidden.
It appears to me that he best 
way to describe President John­
son is as an aggressive, shrewd 
politician who will manipulate 
enough progressive legislation 
through Congress to enable him­
self to be elected in the Novem­
ber election.

Willie Mosconi coming Sunday, Oct. 25th
at non-existent straws to clinch 
his argument.
The article correctly quotes 
Senator Goldwater as saying tbat 
“man’s development, in both its 
spiritual and material aspects, is 
not something that can be di­
rected by outside forces.” Pane­
pinto then says that "Goldwater’s 
complete denial of the influence 
of outside forces upon man erases 
such institutions as schools, 
churches; labor unions, and even 
the government of our society.” 
At this point, the author says 
that Senator Goldwater’s theory 
“tends to collapse.” But the ar­
gument is fallacious. The various 
institutions are NOT outside for­
ces, but simply instruments of 
man to better provide for his own 
development. Goldwater’s theory 
doesn’t collapse at all.
The article also implies that 
the “conservative” belief of many 
people living in different genera­
tions are Goldwater’s beliefs. For 
example, he- implies that Gold­
water approves of the idea that 
“an aristocracy must rule the 
people.” The Senator has never 
even suggested this. He believes 
in limited power and has stated 
that power corrupts.
Panepinto also suggests that 
Goldwater agrees that “this is 
the best of all possible worlds,” 
and that he therefore says it is 
best to “leave well enough alone.” 
This is again wrong. Goldwater 
is not willing to “leave well 
enough alone, but wants to “ap­
ply established truths to the prob­
lems of the contemporary world.” 
He holds that we must and do 
have certain inviolable principles 
which should govern solutions to 
the problems of a changing “so­
cial, economic, and political land­
scape.”

Fly-Catching Becomes New Fad
by Sue Attinson
Fly-catching is Carnegie Tech’s newest athletic pursuit. 
Armed with bottles, screens, boxes, and nets, the biology 
students of M-19 have spent several days at the garbage 
dumps of Skibo and Morewood
They are collecting flies for labo­
ratory experimentaion.
They’ve discovered that fly- 
catching requires great dexterity, 
keen eye-sight and rapid eye- 
hand coordination. Maneuverabil­
ity between the pails is also 
portant.
Some use the “temptation" 
method of fly-catching. They fill 
jars with jam and liver and leave 
them at the garbage dump over­
night. Others attempt to capture 
an alighting fly with cup and 
cardboard.
The best method, however, ap­
pears to be the “open-fisted” ap­
proach. According to students, 
one fly-catcher has captured six 
flies a session using this method.
A descriptive source reports 
that ,smy arm hangs limp; then I 
suddenly reach up and grab.”
The biology students supply

Others have converted boxes 
into screened fly rooms; some 
have built airy-screened cages.
One student applied carpentry 
techniques and built a ply-wood 
house with two doorways and in­
terior shelving. These homes and 
their occupants are kept in the 
MMCC biology laboratory.
Students complain that fly- 
catching is difficult but that trans- 
ferral of flies from their tempo­
rary to their permanent quarters 
is even more trying.
There may be many captive 
flies in the biology lab, the stu­
dents report, but here are many 
more that didn’t quite make it.

Early Tartan Threat Squashed; 
Scots Gain Final Glory, 27-0
I by Ron Bidula
\ Carnegie Tech and the College of Wooster inauguratedf an all Scottish gridiron rivalry last Saturday at Tech Field
¦ with the Scots from Ohio Blanking the Tartans 27-0. The
[' Woosterites scored all their points^-------------------------------------------------------
slipped, trying to gather Wis’s 
pass. Wooster defensive end Bruce 
Vandersall intercepted the aerial 
.apd outran the CIT pursuers for 
and eighty-five yard TD at 6:50: 
The conversion was good and 
Wooster lead 7- 0.
The bouncing kick-off eluded 
the Tech front line and Jim 
Black covered it on his own 6. 
Tech quickly moved to the 20 
with Wis sneaking for two, hand­
ing off to Gilchrist for 4, and 
then passing to Jim Black at the 
sideline. Wooster stiffened at the 
25. Merrill was stopped for no 
gain on the next play. On the 
second and third downs Wis was 
dropped twice for long losses 
when he couldn’t spot his re­
ceivers quickly enough. Gilchrist 
then kicked short to the CIT 32.
Scot halfback Jeff Zom was 
dropped for a five yard loss be­
fore freshman halfback Mike Gor­
don took a pitchout and burst 
through the Tech secondary for 
a thirty-seven yard TD at 2:36. 
The PAT was good and the Tar­
tans trailed 14-0.
Tech started rolling again af­
ter Meriill fought his way back 
to the 44 on the kick-off. Two 
consecutive first downs brought 
the ball to the Scot 30 from 
where two plays later Wis hit 
Jim Black on the 18. Jim couldn’t 
hold on to the elusive pigskin,
in the first half for their second 
win of this year.
The cookie crumbled in favor 
of the Tartans at the outset when 
Wooster fumbled Jack Love’s 
opening kick-off and junior Bill 
Dengler recovered for Tech at 
the Scot 29. Afte*; a five yard 
penalty against Wooster, Wis 
niewski pitched to Dave Gilchrist 
who circled right aid for six 
ife yards and a first down at the 18. 
The Scots then stopped Dick Mer- 
ril for no gain, but were off-side 
on the next play when Wis was 
smeared going back to pass. On 
the 13, Wis threw a screen to Zak 
for a short gain before Wooster 
shot off-side again on the next 
play. The penalty gave CIT a 
first down on the enemy 6.
Tech appeared TD-bound as 
Zak plunged to the 3, but the 
rugged Wooster defense stopped 
Gilchrist twice for no gain and 
knocked a desperation fourth pass 
out of the hands of Jim Black at 
the goal line. The Scots took 
over with 10:21 left.
.Interceptions Kill Drives 
Wooster punted after three 
plays netted only three yards, and 
once again the Tartans appeared 
headed toward paydirt. After two 
running plays moved the ball to 
the Wooster 37, Wis hit senior 
end, Bill Coleman, at the 23. 
Tech fans groaned on the next 
play, however, as Jim Black

however, and defender Jeff Zorn 
stole the ball and returned it to 
the 21 as. the quarter ended.
Wooster wasted no time as. the 
second quarter began. After mov­
ing on the ground to their own 
40, Rod Dingle scooted around 
left end all the way for a sixty 
yard score. The kick split the up'- 
rights and the score was now 
21-0 at 14:03.
A rout seemed to be in the 
making after the kick-off as Wis 
fumbled the snap on first down 
and Wooster again had the ball 
at the Tech 34. Coach Gasparella’s 
defense stiffened, however, and 
CIT took over four plays later 
at their 28.
Tech couldn’t come up with the 
big play. After Merill and Gianni 
twice moved the sticks, the Scots 
stiffened and took over on. downs 
at their 40. Wooster then moved 
60 yards in eight plays for their 
fourth TD. The drive was cli­
maxed by a fifteen yard Poling 
to Dingle aerial at 5:19 in the 
coffin comer, for. the sophomore 
halfback’s second score of the day. 
The kick seemed good, but a 
penalty moved the ball to the 
7, from where the kick failed. 
Wooster now lead 27-0. ..
Game Slows
Neither team could .mount an 
offensive, in the last five minutes 
of the half: CIT shuffled its, quar­
terbacks, but neither Hubka or 
Wis could come up with the long 
bomb.
Kiltie bands from, both schools 
highlighted the halftime activi~ 
ties. The yellow and black Mac­
Leod Plaid provided an interest­
ing contrast to the red and black 
Carnegie Plaid. Bagpipers from 
the two bands' tickled the ear­
drums of the spectators during 
the show and the CIT cheerlead­
ers performed their ever-present 
cartwheels.
The second half was a\ defen­
sive duel with neither team able 
to score. Wooster intercepted an 
errant Tech pass on the third 
play of the half but couldn’t, move 
consistently. After the two teams 
traded units, Wooster moved to 
the CIT 38 with some hard run­
ning by senior fullback Walt 
Blaich, but the Tech defense 
forced the Scots to kick short to 
the CIT 16. On the next play 
Chuck Zak came up with the best 
Tech run of the day as he bursted 
through the Scot secondary for 21 
yards to the Tech 37. Zak and 
Gilchrist then carried the ball on 
short runs to the enemy 46. Wis 
then threw to RayMtz at the 38 
for the third consecutive Tech 
first down, and Dick Merrill broke 
through the middle of the line 
for ten yards. On the next play 
he gathered in a Wianiewski pass 
at the 15 for another first down.
Then the drive fizzled. After 
a run, an incomplete pass, and a 
bootleg left 'Tech still "short of a 
FD, Wis was-smeared in his back- 
field at the Wooster 20. The Scots 
took over with 1:20 left in the 
third period.
CIT forced, a Wooster punt as 
the last period began. Freshman 
Dick Bell followed some hard 
blocking from his own 40 to the 
Wooster 38 on the return. Tech 
quickly moved to the Wooster 11 
on a long gainer by Merrill. 
Wooster took over at. 12:20.
Tech forced Wooster to punt 
twice in the next three minutes 
and resorted to the long pass in 
a. vain attempt to dent the score­
board at least once. In attempting 
to punt a third time from Shis 
40, Blaich was dropped by Ray 
Metz and Tech had the ball at 
the Scot 44. Hubka moved the 
Tartans to the 10 before the last 
Tech offensive bogged down at
3:46. The Scots took over and 
ran out the clock.
The game was one of complete, 
frustration for CIT. At least four 
Tech drives deep into Wooster 
territory were stopped short, of 
the goal line as the Scot defense 
toughened in these key situations. 
Tech ran eighty-two plays to 
Wooster’s forty-five and won a 
moral victory in the statistics. 
The only statistic that really 
counted, though, was the one on 
the scoreboard.
Tech had nothing to be 
ashamed of, and needs only to 
balance its air and ground , at­
tacks to win. One encouraging 
factor is the fine student support 
being given the team at home.
Tech plays its third home game 
of the season against another 
Ohio team, Case Tech of Cleve­
land, next Saturday afternoon at 
Tech Field.

Favorites Still Good 
In IM Football Play
by Scot McCormick 
Intramural football has begun 
again, and the perrennial football 
powers should be back on top 
once again. ATO, the Grads, and 
BTP are the favorites., along with 
SAE and SN.
ATO in the Eagles League 
Alpha Tau Omega is the favorite 
‘to take first place in the Eagles 
‘League, but they will have to fight 
off GSIA “Gold” to take it. The 
ATO’s lost quarterback Steve 
Foels via graduation, but they 
have a fine replacement in junior 
Bud Higginbotham. Gerry Unger, 
Tom Kline and Frank Oliver will 
help make ATO tough for anyone 
to beat.
The only team that may be able 
to swing it for the league cham­
pionship is QSIA. They have a 
few holdovers from last year’s 
unbeatable Grad Eagles, who, 
fortunately for the undergrads, 
broke up for this year’s football 
season. Included in these hold­
overs is Joe Lees, possibly the 
best defensive half iri the school.
“Blacks” Top Grid Team 
The top Grad team this year 
will - be GSIA “Black,” who 
should coast to their league chafih- 
pionship. The only fight in this 
league will be between DU and 
BSR for second place.
The GTad Nods, another good 
graduate team,, will have a lot of 
trouble pushing BTP out of first 
place in the Steelers League. 
With QB Lee Collins returning, 
the Beta’s will be a strong con­
tender. But he Nods, paced by 
Don Shockey, will not go down 
easily.
SAE-SN to Dogfight 
The closest battle for a league 
championship will be in the 
Giants League where SAE and 
SN will stage a dogfight for first. 
When they play each other near 
the end of October, the game will 
be a duel between quarterbacks

negie Tech who is interested

If there are any sleepers this 
year, they would be the Finks in 
the Steelers League, Tau Delt in 
the Eagles, or the Cellar Dwellers 
in the Giants League.
The Cellar Dwellers are thè 
first respectable freshman team to 
come along in quite a while. They 
hit hard, but their lack of ex­
perience will probably keep them 
out of the playoffs, especially 
with SN and SAE in their league.
There are no odds on favorites 
this year like-the ATO’s and the 
Grad Eagles were last year, es­
pecially 'since the Grads have 
finally broken up. There should 
be quite a fight for the champion­
ship, and the I. M. football trophy 
could end -up on just about any­
one’s shelf.
