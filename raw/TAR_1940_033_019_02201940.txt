Math Group Meets 
Every Two Weeks
To learn more about mathe­
matics than they can get in the 
classroom a group of students or­
ganized a Mathematics Club on 
campus last week.
Starting March 1 the group will 
meet on alternate Fridays to hear 
one of the members speak on a 
specific phase of mathematics 
(subjects to be announced in ad­
vance).
Although the present member­
ship includes only a few students 
in addition to those in the De­
partment of Mathematics, others- 
who are interested are requested 
to attend the first meeting.
Louis Sacks,. Instructor in 
Mathematics, will speak on “Ana­
lytic Projective Geometry” at the 
first meeting. In the last issue 
of the TARTAN Mr. Sacks, who 
is also treasurer of the group, was 
incorrectly listed as Harry Sacks.
1 Students are invited to attend
any particular meetings which 
may interest them if they do not 
care to join. _________

to go into rehearsal immediately. The call for any person want­
ing to act in the skits will go out in the next two weeks, and any
person, including all non-dramats, are asked to answer this call.
The chorus call will go out about the same time, and any person, 
to quote Shirley Brown, the dance director of the club, “who 
isn’t bashful, and would like to dance, especially boys over six 
feet, should definitely try out for the chorus.”

Tuesday forty-two songs were 
submitted to the Executive Board. 
Of these the following 12 are still 
up for consideration in the final

“No More Marriages” Is “Gay Play About Gay 
People;” Production Keeps Comedy Mood
By Ruth Brodie
It requires a great deal of 
bravery for an amateur play­
wright to present a comedy to 
the public. When an audience 
sees a tragedy-or any non-comic 
piece—it says, “Yes. That’s very 
good. Considering, of course, that 
the author is so young, etc.” But 
no audience will stop to give the 
benefit of any doubt when it is 
called upon to laugh. No More 
Marriages can be judged on its 
own merits. And, according to the 
way Tech audiences are receiving 
it, it is doing very well that way.
Not Simply Farce 
It must not be implied, how­
ever, that No More Marriages is 
roaring farce with nothing to hold 
it together but laygh lines. It 
has a well-constructed plot. Deal­
ing with the marital difficulties of 
an actor and his wife, the play
brought about by the interference 
of various friends, pseudo-friends, 
and servants. The characters are 
believable; unlike many comedy 
characterizations, they are not 
just types, they are really people. 
Unusual people, it is true, but 
genuine.
Mood Is Retained
On the whole, the production 
is a good one. It is done gayly, 
with the light quality the script 
demands, but never does the fun 
go overboard. Happily, the actors 
air seem to realize that they are 
playing high comedy and not bur­
lesque. Cort Steen’s set is very 
much in keeping with the mood 
of the show.
There are one or two piddling 
little things, that should be men­
tioned, I think, if only as sugges­
tions to Mr. Hunt for what they’re 
worth to him. In keeping with all
takes us through the complications I’ve said about this being defnite-
ly high comedy, I think something 
should be done about the very 
beginning of the first act. ¦ It 
starts you out with the feeling 
that it’s nothing but two people 
wise-cracking at. each other, and I 
think a toning down of some of 
the gags in that part would help 
establish the real character of the 
show sooner.
Show Needs Cutting 
Another thing, an audience is 
apt to get the impression that 
some of the more serious dialogue 
(particularly in the third act) has 
just been thrown in. Perhaps a 
little judicious cutting would cure 
that; there are several places 
that will be helped by cutting. 
These are trifling objections, 
though, and I think that No More 
Marriages will provide one of the 
most pleasant evenings you have 
spent in the theater in a long 
time.
Tech ROTC

Reputation
Junior, Senior 
Courses Show 
Big Registration
According to information re­
ceived by Lt. Col. Oscar O. ICuentz, 
head of the Military Department, 
the R. O. T. C. Engineer Unit at 
Carnegie has a greater percentage 
of its total enrollment in the ad­
vanced course (juniors and sen­
iors) than any other institution 
in the United States maintaining 
an Engineer Unit. This fact re­
flects on the popularity of advanc­
ed course training at Carnegie. 
Twenty-seven per cent of the en­
gineering students here are en­
rolled, in the junior and senior 
years, while the percentage for 
Engineer Units throughout the na­
tion averages fifteen per cent.
Carnegie Supplies Officers
Carnegie has contributed a total 
of 503 officers, to the Engineer 
Reserve. This total is surpassed 
by but three institutions, two of 
which maintain a male enrollment 
of approximately twice that of 
C. I. T.
Forty-five Juniors from C. I. T. 
completed the Engineer Camp 
last summer, this attendance was 
exceeded only by Alabama Poly­
technic, Ohio State University, 
University of Illinois, and from 
Texas A and M., all of them 
institutions with comparatively 
lax-ge enrollments.
Enrollment Surpassed
This year is the first year that 
the second semester enrollment in 
the advanced course has surpass­
ed that of the first semester. 
Usually one or more students 
withdraw from school for scho­
lastic or financial reasons, but this 
year the return to school of mem­
bers who had previously with­
drawn created an increase of one 
student in the semester’s enroll­
ment over that of the preceding 
semester.
Annual Initiation 
Of APO Brings 
Twelve, Into Fold
Carnegie’s chapter of Alpha Phi 
Omega, National Service Frater­
nity, held its annual initiation last 
Friday at 5 p. m.
Alpha Phi Omega was organ­
ized by a group of college men 
at Lafayette University, all former 
Boy Scouts, for the furtherance 
of Scout principles in college life. 
Its members at Carnegie try to 
be of service to' the school by ori- 
'enting freshmen, supplying a map 
of the campus, marking trees and 
by performing other helpful acts.
The ceremony was held in the 
Commons’ Annex and was fol­
lowed by a banquet in honor of 
the new brothers. Those initiat- 
Philip J. Smith ’43; Arthur E. 
Uber Jr. ’43; H. Marshall Mallory

Dean of Women 
Goes to St. Louis 
For Convention
Yesterday Dean Mary W. Green 
left for St. Louis to attend a con­
vention of the National Associa­
tion of Deans of Women. The 
meeting will be held at the Stat- 
ler Hotel and will last from Tues­
day, February 20 through Friday, 
February 23.
The group is composed of ad­
visors and deans from various 
schools. Because of its size, it is 
to be divided into sections made 
up of deans from colleges and 
universities, from teachers’ col­
leges, qnd from high schools and 
prep schools.
The convention program in­
cludes a variety of subjects. There 
will be discussions on extra-cur- 
ricular supervision, student resi-r- 
dence as an educational unit, ad­
visability of a dean’s teaching in 
addition to her regular duties, and 
many other topics of equal im­
portance.

ONE OF THE GIRLS
FLOSSIE CRAIGHEAD
Page the marriage course: Ac-' 
cording to the twenty-seven male 
members of a psychology class at 
Arizona State Teachers College, 
they wanted a wife to be enter­
taining, friendly, beautiful, cheer­
ful, considerate, helpful, honest, 
and intelligent, in that order. The 
list was compiled as a part of a 
detailed questionnire. The mar­
riage course at Tech has been 
gathering similar lists from the 
students here, both male and fe­
male, but we don’t have the re­
sults yet. Maybe next week. In­
cidentally, the Arizona boys se­
lected Priscilla Lane as the em­
bodiment of these traits.
We salute the spirit and the 
idea of the investigation of Stu­
dent Council into expenditures. A 
healthy curiosity is a good char­
acteristic, even though it may 
sometimes be a dangerous one. 
But while we’re investigating, let’s 
look at a few more things. Let’s
then to go after it. Getting along 
with other people and being help­
ful takes practice—just like danc­
ing, doing math or anything else.
After each interview note for 
yourself your own plus and minus 
qualities in that particular inter­
view. Study the results from your 
own point of view. Discover 
whether you got your point across.
Remember that it takes more 
than a B. S. .degree to put your­
self over in a fifteen minute inter­
view.
see, first of all, that all organiza­
tions are being investigated with 
the same thoroughness. Let’s see 
whether the class honoraries de­
serve the concessions they/ enjoy. 
Let’s see whether intercollegiate 
sports interest students to the ex­
tent of what they cost. Lot’s see 
whether we can root up a little 
of the dishonesty when students 
betray a position of trust. It 
would be more than a little hard 
on the neck of any person, stu­
dent or faculty member, who 
tried.

Tecli Student Hears Intimate Facts 
Of Carnegie’s Life While at Home
By Leonard Cliotiner
Horace Greeley told the young 
:man who was seeking his fortune 
•to go west. My advice to you 
"who are seeking information about 
Andrew Carnegie is to go home. 
I know; I went home and learned 
more about the real Andrew Car­
negie than I have learned in my 
five months as a student here.
This is how it happened. Our 
next door neighbor, who is Scotch, 
asked me how I liked going to 
Pitt. In exactly three seconds I 
let it be known to her and ev­
eryone else within hearing dis­
tance that I was going to Car­
negie Tech, that I liked the school 
a lot, and for her not to mistake 
Tech for Pitt under any condi­
tion. (You see, I have already 
acquired the TRUE Tech spirit.)
“You know of course,” she said, 
“That I knew old Andy.”
Now just who she meant by old 
Andy .didn’t quite strike me, but 
when I perceived that she meant 
our benefactor, I replied that I 
never guessed that she had been 
so honored.
“My yes,” she started again,
with that typical Scotch brogue, 
“I remember him well. You see 
we were tenant farmers of his on 
Skee-bo Castle.”
“Sky-bo Castle,” I interrupted. 
“No, no, a true Scotchman would 
throw a fit if he heard it called 
Sky-bo. (Cheerleaders and song­
sters please note.)
“What did Mr. Carnegie look 
like?” I asked.
“Oh, he was a wee man with a 
wee white beard,” she x-eplied. “He 
would bring presents ax-ound to 
the tenants and sometimes he 
would set for a cup o’ tea. His 
lady, who was vexra sweet would 
hae a cup, too. His daughter liked 
the castle verra much. I believe 
she max'ried a young Edinboro 
lawyer and spends most of her 
days at the castle. Yes, old Andy 
was a verra kind man.
“Well, I must be getting on to 
supper, young man. Jock raises 
a fuss when his potatoes are cold, 
you know.”
So I repeat, if you want to learn 
something interesting about An­
drew Carnegie—Go home young 
man, go home.

Facility Adviser’sWote Is 
Basis of Final Tartan "Call”
From time to time the Tartan has issued “calls” for stu­
dents who may be interested in the kind of experience that 
work on the Tartan staff can give them. The following note 
from Professor Leo T. Lawler, Tartan Faculty Adviser, ade­
quately tells the story:
Editor, the Tartan:
Since the twice-a-week publication of the Tartan 
will probably entail nearl}* double the amount of work 
previously necessary iu getting out the Tartan, it seems 
to me that there would be additional opportunities for 
students interested in publication work—such as writ­
ing, circulation, advertising, and the like. The oppor­
tunities, of course, have always been present, but prob­
ably never to the extent to which they are now. May I 
suggest, therefore, that you appeal to the students to 
take advantage of this'development ? It ought to be of 
especial interest to first and second year students and to 
all those, who have had previous experience in publica­
tion work. A satisfactory response, moreover, will go 
far toward making your new venture a success.
Sincerely,
LEO T. LAWLER.
"We noted at one time that there is “an initial period of 
strangeness” associated with any new activity that may prevent 
some people from “coming out” for it. This is particularly true 
with the Tartan. There is a certain amount to learn before you 
can press a typewriter key, or sell an ad. But students who 
may be interested in our work will find that we bend over back­
wards to help them get a foothold. Of course, our geniality does 
not extend to the point of serving cocktails in the office, but we 
will put you to work. x
Tuesday late afternoon or evening, Wednesday afternoon, 
Friday afternoon and evening—these are the times during 
which our editorial staff is at work. If you are interested in 
editorial work see the editor; sports, see the Sports editor; Busi­
ness, see the Business Manager. There are also openings on the 
staff for students in the Printing, or Painting and Design de­
partments. Their work will consist of advertising layout and 
design, copywriting, and actual advertising production.
The Tartan needs active, intelligent workers to make its 
semi-weekly publication schedule a financial and editorial suc­
cess. The experience is valuable, the opportunity is here . . . 
and it knocks for the last time this year.

FLORENCE CRAIGHEAD
Vivacious—that’s Flossie Craig- 
head. She enjoys all sports—par- 
tiiularly swimming and skiing. 
That’s probably why she’s presi­
dent of W. A. A.
Her activities are many. She 
was a member of Owens, an hono­
rary Cadet officer—now she’s a 
member of Mortar Board, Social 
Chairman of Gamma Phi Sigma 
and a Scotch and Soda Club mem­
ber. Remember Whistler’s moth­
er in last year’s Carnival show? 
That was Flossie.
She was elected the most out­
standing senior woman in the De­
partment of Costume Economics in 
a recent “Scottie” feature. Flos­
sie would like to do department 
store work after graduation, but 
she definitely (and she’s really 
quite emphatic about it) does not 
want to teach.
Gabbing—so she says—is her 
main fault. She loves to talk-— 
about anything.
Another fault—eating too many 
ice cream cones. She doesn’t drink 
or smoke—but she hates to be 
called wholesome.
People who look bored annoy 
her. She also dislikes the un­
friendliness on campus. “People 
who go to the same school and see 
each other day after day should 
speak to each other.”

?--------------------PiKAs Notch 
Fifth Victory:; 
The la Xi Wins
The Citcom Clan just about 
sewed up the title in the Indepen­
dent League by downing their 
nearest competitors, the Freshman 
Engineers by a 19-9 count, on 
Wednesday night. Both squads 
featured defensive play, making 
field goals almost as rare as snow­
balls in August.
Dick Ruthrauff, the Clan’s big 
gun, again led the scoring, with 
eight points, closely followed by 
Paul Loveday who tossed in six 
markers. Neat guarding by Bill 
Jamison and John Hieghts of the 
Clan kept Johnny Pratt, Frosli 
flash, down, to one lone basket.
The Architects racked up their 
first victory by trimming the 
AIChE squad, 34-24. Dave Jaco- 
vac, loser’s forward turned in nine 
points to lead both teams in the 
scoring department.
Thursday night found the Theta 
Xi men taking on the Betas and 
the red hot PiKAs tackling the 
ATOs in Fraternity League frays.
The TX squad had little trouble 
with the Squirrel Hillers, beating 
them by a 30-8 count. Dick “Eight 
Ball” Walker starred for the win­
ners, tossing in seven field goals 
and two foul shots for a total of 
16 points. The best the Betas 
could do against the close/Theta 
Xi guarding was to register four

goals during the contest.
Forging into the league lead, 
the men from Morewood ran up a 
record total of points to snow un­
der the ATOs to the tune of GO- 
12. The victors used no less than 
ten players in the triumph, with 
Dick Yardumian accounting for
14 markers and Ward Duchene 
totaling ten. This was the PiKA’s 
fifth victory in as many league 
frays.
Cy I-Ierre, Art Klein, and Buck 
Jones, big three of the DU’s of­
fense, accounted for 15, 13 and 10 
points respectively in their squad’s 
40-21 victory over the Delt ag­
gregation. The fray started peace­
fully enough with both teams 
matching basket for basket, the 
score at half-time standing at 11-
9. In the second period the story 
was different; the DUs began 
pouring them in from all angles, 
running up 29 markers in the de­
luge of field goals.

BASKETBALL GRABS THE SPOTLIGHT
— By Zach Hirsch --
With Johnny Burke somewhere between Lancaster, Pa., 
and Pittsburgh as a result of his participation in the Tech-F. F 
M. basketball game, the column has changed hands for this issue.
It is interesting to note what Claire Bee, coach of the peren­
nially good L. I. U. basketball five, said on the radio last week. 
He named the -five top basketball teams in the country placing 
them as (1) N. Y. U., (2) Southern California, (3) Purdue, (4) 
Duquesne, and (5) Colorado. Since that statement was released 
by Coach Bee, Purdue, although tied for the lead in the Big Ten 
Conference, was beaten by two points by the co-leader, Indiana, 
which also has topped Duquesne. Colorado, too, has been 
beaten. I wonder where Indiana, and such teams as Villanova 
and little heard-of Panzer, which beat N. Y. U. with the same 
squad they have this year, are ranked.
# # s * #
While on the subject of basketball, let’s turn to the intra­
mural leagues for a minute. The following boys have really 
been standing out in the games so far this year: Dick Ruth­
rauff, track and soccer star, of the Citcom Clan; Cy Herre and 
Buck Jones of the DU’s, Walt Stull from Scobell, Henderson 
Hall’s HaJlerough, and Rankin, Yardumium, and Patterson 
for the PiKA’s. The other teams in the league had better 
watch these boys carefully.

Sport Shots From Here and There
The Skibo swimmers sure came through in winning style in
their meet with Reserve on Friday. Out of the seven individual 
events and two relays, the Tartans won all of the seven and 
one of the relays. But what is more interesting, is that in the 
individual events, Tech natators won only two of the second 
and third places in the events. They piled up enough first 
places, to take a 44-31 win however.
It is interesting to notice that Jack Sherer, Rip Collins, 
and Jim Egan of the Pitt squad were all declared ineligible for 
further basketball games because they failed to make the qual­
ity points required of athletes . . . Rube Stark and Red 
Burch are still in the top five in the city for average points per 
game . . . The fencing team is trying to make sure that they 
get their pictures in the Thistle, and would like letters next 
year if their proposed intercollegiate schedule goes through . . . 
The Tau Delts and the Beta Sigs are leading- in the intramural 
-table tennis contests. Both squads have beaten other teams by 
a 5 to 0 score . . . Beginning next week in the Tartan sports 
pages, stories will be carried about all of the “little-known” 
coaches on the campus . . . People don’t seem to be taking 
advantage of the facilities in Thistle Hall for table tennis, bad­
minton, etc. . . . Why not try?

Beat Tech
Rube Learls Scoring 
With 27 Points 
In Two Contests
Tech’s basketball team went 
eastward to meet Temple’s five 
and the Franklin and Marshall 
quintet, and in both cases went 
down to defeat. On Friday, tlie 
Owls triumphed by a 60 to 38 
margin, while on the next night 
the boys from F. & M. took over 
the Skibos by 34 to 29.
Although the Tartans scored 
first, the Owl quintet began to reel 
off- score after score, and prove 
that their close margin of defeat 
by N. Y. U. was not a mistake. 
Tech managed to tie the score up 
at 13-13, but then they were lost. 
The home team, breaking fast for 
lay up shots, pulled far out ahead 
to set up a 35 to 21 lead. In the 
second half, the Owls really turn­
ed the Plaid to rout and wound 
up at 60 to 38.
Captain Rube Stark was high 
scorer in the game with 17 points 
to his credit, and the following 
night again led in the Tech scor­
ing column by piling up ten mark­
ers.
The team swept ahead of the 
Diplomats in the first half and 
built up an 18 to 12 lead after 
the first two quarters. Then, pos­
sibly because of the hard game 
the night before, the Skibo de­
fense absolutely collapsed and 
the F. & M. team went ahead to 
take a decision of 34 to 29 by 
sooring 11 points in each of the 
last two quarters.

Skibo Skaters 
Battle Dukes
In ah attempt to avenge last 
Tuesday’s shellacking at the hands 
of the high-scoring Duquesne 
hockey squad, the Tartan sextet 
will take to the ice Thursday 
evening at the Gardens. The 
Skibos will be out to stop Hill- 
topper.Bill Vance who has been 
the spearhead of the Duke offense 
all season.
Although the Dukes started four 
wings in the last game with Tech, 
it is unlikely that this combination 
will appear again Thursday. With 
the Carnegie scoring combination 
of Burleigh, Schilawske, and Wil­
son in top shape, the Bluffites will 
have to present a strong back-line. 
A loss would mean a serious blow 
to the Hilltoppers’ bid for con­
ference championship. Last night 
the Tartans battled" Western Re­
serve at the Gardens.
Tecli Defeats 
Reserve, Case
Boehmig Stars In 
Tartan Victories
Carnegie Tech swimmers made 
•a clean sweep of their Ohio in­
vasion by defeating both Western 
^Reserve and Case at Cleveland. 
Led by Bob Boehmig, the Skibo 
splashers defeated Western Be- 
.serve 44-31 on Friday night. The 
visiting Tartans won eight out of 
nine events, losing only the 400- 
;yard relay. Boemig won the 440- 
yard free style event and anchored 
the 300-yard medley relay team 
fo victory. Hirch won the 220- 
.yard free style, Lockhead won the 
50-yard free style, and Vance 
took the 100-yard free style. The 
140-yard backstroke was won by 
Molvie, the 200-yard breast­
stroke was taken by Anthony, and 
Patterson and Lewis placed first 
-and second in the diving event for 
Tech.
Again capturing eight out of 
nine first places, Tech defeated 
¦the Case tankers 53-22 on Satur­
day afternoon, the 50-yard free 
style being the only event lost. 
Tech won both the 300-yard med­
ley and the 440-yard relay, and 
placed second and third in the 
diving. Hirsch won the 220-yard 
free style, Lockhead won the 100- 
yard free style, and Hirsch also 
won the 440-yard free style. The 
150-yard backstroke event was 
won by Mol vie for Tech and the 
200-yard breast stroke was taken 
by Anthony. The Tartan mermen 
should be congratulated for the 
two victories won at Cleveland.

Facuity Plans 
To Collaborate
On Suggestions
One of the many fine things 
about the Carnegie Evening Col­
lege is the liberal attitude of the 
Faculty towards student criticisms 
and suggestions. The student coun­
cil has established a very effective 
system for obtaining and present­
ing to the faculty these sugges­
tions. Realizing that individual 
expression would be rather weak 
and ineffectual the council has 
requested that students discuss 
their problems with their college 
officers. This serves to center 
all the information in the hands 
of one body, namely the -Evening 
Student Council, and the faculty 
has agreed to take under advise­
ment anything which council may 
bring up.
Each year the council and the 
faculty meet at a dinner for the 
purpose of discussing the various 
problems which have come up in 
the preceding school year. At this 
time the faculty also announces 
its plans for improving the cur­
riculum, so that council may con­
vey these plans to the student 
body.
In the past this arrangement 
has proved to be a very effective 
means of informing the Faculty of 
student opinion.
Any student who may have a 
suggestion to offer is asked to 
either get in touch with his col­
lege officers or if this is not con­
venient to write a letter to the 
editor of the Carnegie Plaid. While 
ho definite date for the dinner has 
yet been set it will in all probabil­
ity take place early in the spring.
Phi Nu Holds 
Card Party
Annual Gathering 
Draws Crowd
Phi Nu Fraternity held one of 
its card parties in the Carnegie 
Union last Saturday evening, Feb­
ruary 10. About thirty-five couples 
of the group turned out for the 
affair and spent an enjoyable ev­
ening swapping stories and re­
newing old friendships.
While some of the boys were 
busy with their pipes and stories, 
the remainder of the group 
brought out the card tables. There 
were games of bridge, 500, and 
bingo played during the evening, 
and prizes were offered to the best 
players in each group.
No party can be complete with­
out food so the committee made 
sure that there would be plenty 
to eat. When the group decided 
that it was time to devote some 
time to that happy pastime, there 
were sandwiches, cake, and ice 
cream in amounts large enough to 
satisfy the heartiest appetite.
Russell Lahr and Bill Haas were 
co-chairmen of the affair, and 
a great deal of credit should be 
given them for the smooth man­
ner with which the party was 
handled.
It was announced during the 
evening that Fred Werling, a 
member of the fraternity, and his 
wife who were married on Febru­
ary 4, were celebrating their wed­
ding. The group wished the young 
couple much success in their new 
career, and as the curfew hour ap­
proached, prepared to leave for 
their homes.

Band and. Time 
Already Selected 
By Social Chairman
In 1924 Evening Student Coun­
cil inaugurated its first Washing­
ton’s Birthday Dance and during 
the last sixteen years, this event 
has become the next oldest tradi­
tion on the Carnegie campus. The 
popularity of this dance increases 
each year, and early reports fore­
cast this as one of the finest to 
be held.
One of the outstanding features 
of this dance is the colorful deco­
rations used, which are always in 
keeping with the patriotic spirit 
chat is associated with this cele­
brated occasion.
In previous years the dance was 
held on the anniversary 'of the 
Father of Our Country, but since 
February 22 is not a school holi­
day, Saturday, March 2 has been 
chosen as the date.
The committee, headed by So­
cial Chairman Frank Young, has 
been working to make this oc­
casion prove most entertaining and 
satisfying to all of the many en­
thusiastic participants.
Following much thought and 
consideration, Clyde Knight’s 
popular band was chosen to sup­
ply the chief element for the 
dance. This orchestra has ap­
peared on the campus before and 
has always been accepted very 
favorably by the evening group.

Call a Cop !
One of these fine evenings, some 
one—maybe one oi your class­
mates—is going to come driving 
up around the curve from Schen- 
ley Park and meet his Maker, 
right there in Frew Street, be­
tween the traffic buttons and the 
curb. Our hero will come buzzing 
’round the bend, and too late he 
will see that cars are parked 
double where no cars at all are 
supposed to park.
Everybody will cluck sympa­
thetically, say that it’s too bad, 
ask if there was insurance, and 
conjecture that he had been drink­
ing. The blame will be fixed— 
probably on some innocent by­
stander. But We know where the 
blame should go, don’t we?

Some students will object to in­
terference with their personal 
parking wishes, true enough. Nev­
ertheless, for the safety of stu­
dents and other motorists who use 
Frew Street, there must be closer 
regulation of parking procedure. 
Carnegie Tech’s traffic problem 
is a serious one under even the 
closest supervision, and the park­
ing restrictions have been sadly 
neglected of late.
Purely Mathematical
Many trick reasons for the con- 
'gestion on registration nights have 
been advanced. They range all 
the way from the fact that only 
two bookkeeping machines are in 
operation to the supposition that 
faculty members must be a cross 
between a Solomon and a train 
dispatcher to answer the questions 
that students ask. Most of the 
explanations sound like hashish 
dreams, but the one that is rarely 
advanced sounds most plausible. It 
involves the fairly simple mathe­
matics necessary to determine the 
job that fee clerks are asked to 
do.
Most of the congestion occurs 
at the tables where fees are en­
tered on the cards and totaled. 
Four persons do the job. This 
year they wrote fees and totaled 
costs for well over 2,000 students. 
Registration was to be accom­
plished in six hours, so that the 
clerks were expected to handle 
333 students evefry hour or 83 
students per clerk every hour. In 
other words, each clerk was sup­
posed to write fees, check tuition 
rates and credits in the catalogue 
when necessary, answer questions, 
toial the fees, and still pass one 
student every 45 seconds! (Ac­
tually, registration was extended 
half an hour each night and the 
clerks averaged only one student 
every 50 seconds.)
Maybe another fee clerk or two 
would clear up the congestion.
Who Wants ‘Longies’ ?
Romance, apparently, has rear­
ed its pretty head again. Is the 
call for formal dresses at Car­
negie Tech dances to be taken as 
a blow struck against the gym­
nastics of swing?
Prior to the Valentine Dance, 
longies got a boost on the grounds 
that they made for a more sen­
timental atmosphere at a dance. 
Are we to understand that senti­
ment conies only in long skirts?
The chief danger in the move­
ment, as we see it, is that should 
the custom of “going formal” gain 
headway, the dances will lose the 
charming informality that has 
characterized them. We like the 
present custom better. How, if 
the girl had to wear a formal, 
could we decide at 8:30 that we 
would go to the dance at nine?

Once again we take off our hat 
and bow to the College of Indus­
tries for the fine dance which 
they held in Thitle Hall last Sat­
urday evening.
This group has always been 
known for the excellence of their 
dances. They have brought some 
of the district’s best bands to the 
campus. Among these were 
Charles Pallas, who has dropped 
his band to devote all his time 
to his KDKA work, Benny Bur­
ton, Bill LeRoy, and A1 Fremont 
who, through no fault of the 
school officers failed to give the 
music expected of him. Decora­
tions and corsages are always 
good, and give evidence of much 
thought and planning by the of­
ficers.
Student support for the dances 
sponsored by this group has al­
ways been good, which proves 
that it does pay to bring them the 
best if you want their support. 
Despite the fact that these are 
free dances, I would venture to 
say that they come very near be­
ing financial successes.
We all know that Industries has 
the largest registration on the 
campus and is the richest in dol­
lars and cents, but we also know 
that the entire student group has 
shared in the benefits. The spot­
lights which are so much a part 
of our dances were purchased by 
this group and donated to Coun­
cil.
Vocational students have one 
more dance scheduled for the 
year, and it is rumored that the 
officers are planning to make it 
one which will long be remem­
bered by everyone. So let’s ex­
tend thanks to the College of In­
dustries for their fine dances in 
the past and extend to them best 
wishes for continued success in 
the future.

Ioli Reelected 
Vice President 
Of Art School
Cesidio F. Ioli, popularly 
known as “Sil” to his many 
friends, is Vice-President of the 
Evening College of Fine Arts. This 
tall, curly-haired young fellow 
with the broad smile, hails from 
the East Liberty section of Pitts­
burgh. He is always the least 
talkative of any group, this silent 
attitude leading to his being 
termed “mystery man of the Cam­
pus.”
Sil was graduated from Central 
Catholic High School in 1934 and 
he entered the Evening Arts 
School the same year. He is study­
ing architecture and expects to 
receive his certificate in June, but 
plans to return to Carnegie Tech 
in the fall as usual, although it is 
probable that he will not enroll 
in the Arts School.
fie is employed by his father 
who is a cement contractor. Sil 
likes all types of contracting, but 
is especially interested in the 
construction of houses and plans 
to specialize in this field at some 
time in. the future.

—are spent gainfully, arranging 
the scrap-book which he has been 
filling for years with interesting 
items of information clipped from 
current newspapers or magazines. 
This information has many times 
proved valuable to him.
Although he did not participate 
in sports in high school, he has 
always been an interested spec­
tator at football and baseball 
games, as well as at tennis and 
golf matches.
He likes to dance and is enthusi­
astic about the Glen Gray style 
of dance music. Despite his fond­
ness for popular music, he ex­
presses preference for classical and 
semi-classical numbers, and Pad­
erewski and Stokowski are his 
ideals.
He is a member of Nu Sigma 
Alpha fraternity.

Night Students 
Will Receive 
Plaid By Mail
Through sleet or snow, fog or 
hail your mailman will deliver 
your copy of the Carnegie Plaid 
to your door commencing with the 
next issue. The United States 
Government has once more been 
entrusted with the monumental 
task of delivering the news of the 
Evening Carnegie campus to the 
student body.
The present system of distribut­
ing the paper by means of stands 
in the halls has not proved as ef­
fective as it was hoped it would. 
Many students were unfamiliar 
with the system or found that no 
papers were on the stand. At the 
last meeting of council the mem­
bers voted to resume the practice 
of mailing the papers.
Only the copy, now distributed 
on Tuesday, which contains the 
Plaid will be mailed.

I bet Ronny Shofi! went to see 
“Gone With the Wind” just to 
see the habitat of his new girl 
friend from the deep deep south— 
And she has quite an appropriate 
name—Elizabeth.
My goodness did you ever see 
so much snow? Seen last Wednes­
day night on our campus, girl dig­
ging boy’s car out of a colossal 
drift on a Valentine date—Must 
have been love . . . And speak­
ing of lucky people who missed 
the snow, Johnnie Deklewa so­
journing in Saint Augustine, Flori­
da. We received a postal.
Not only does Eddie Ziontz go 
in for higher education in Indus­
tries, but he also enjoys higher 
altitudes—He can be often seen 
flying high above the county air­
port adding up solo hours. High 
altitudes don’t make you dizzy do 
they or is that natural?
Pun of the week:—(and pray 
that the printer doesn’t misprint 
it as he did with that Indian 
thing) What is another name for 
ground hog? Sausage!
And speaking of absences—we 
have noticed that Berthella Kleck­
ner has been absent many of these 
week ends—she prefers the State 
College campus to our own.
We have seen del Cimmuto at­
tending the broadcasts of Musical 
Americana on Thursday evenings.
Mrs. Ward had a lovely exhibit 
in the Garden Center competition 
last Tuesday afternoon.
