Senate examines Greek funding
By MICHELLE W. CHAO
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
In an attempt to gauge student 
opinion on the funding of exclu­
sive organizations, Student 
Senate’s Committee on Execu­
tive Organizations (CEO) held 
two Town Meetings last week. 
These meetings allowed students 
to debate whether organizations
like fraternities, sororities, and 
honor societies should be allo­
cated money from Activities Fee 
funding. Reactions were predict­
ably mixed.
“Overall, I think the Town 
Meetings helped us figure out that 
the path we’ve been taking at the 
CEO has been one the campus 
community supports, and I think 
they helped us a lot,” said Charles
Anthe, ajunior electrical and com­
puter engineering (ECE) major 
who is 1m the CEO. “The entire 
issue of funding is a very divisive 
one on this campus, and it has 
gotten a lot of people very moti­
vated on separate sides. But I 
think that by separating the ar­
eas where Activities Fee money 
goes, and setting very specific 
guidelines on what types of activi­

ties should be funded and those 
which shouldn’t, I think we can 
make a funding policy which not 
only satisfies both sides, but actu­
ally fundamentally improves the 
amount of campus involvement 
and social atmosphere here at 
CMU.” Anthe said that although 
he is not a spokesperson for the 
CEO, he thought that this seemed 
to be the conclusion that commit­
tee members were reaching.
The proposal to extend Activi­
ties Fee monies to exclusive orga­
nizations stemmed from a Senate 
review of this year’s fiscal policy. 
The committee reviewing the 
policy suggested changes for next 
year’s policy, including a recom­
mendation that Senate open de­
bate on whether or not to fund 
exclusive organizations. The most 
recent proposals would have al­
lowed Greek organizations to re­
ceive funding for Booth and Buggy.
Some students are convinced 
that there is no need for extra 
money for the exclusive organi­
zations. “I don’t believe that we 
should give them any money,” 
said a junior ECE major who 
wished to remain anonymous. 
“The money that we (the student 
body) pay the University should

Driving Research Center turns on simulator’s ignition
By RYAN D. SCHILLING
Tartan Assistant News Editor
With plans to tackle the colli­
sion problem on American high­
ways, the Carnegie Mellon Re­
search Institute (CMRI) an­
nounced Thursday that it has es­
tablished a Driving Research 
Center (DRC) that will research 
and develop applied technologies 
for driving safety.
“The idea of the Driving Re­
search Center at CMU is to see if 
we can reduce the number of ac­
cidents on the road,” said Dr. 
Alberto Guzman, director of the 
Applied Advanced Technologies 
Group [AATG] and associate di­
rector of the CMRI.
The Center’s research will fo­
cus on heavy trucking. To assist 
its studies, the Center has pur­
chased a customized, full-motion 
truck-driving simulator. The unit, 
to be called the Carnegie Mellon
TruckSim, will assist research­
ers in studying driver fatigue and 
training and vehicle interface. It 
can be programmed to simulate a 
limitless number of situations, 
emergency or otherwise.
“The economic growth of the 
nation is going to require more 
and more trucks on the road,” 
said Guzman during a briefing 
session last Wednesday. “That 
means more drivers. We need to 
train those drivers.”
AATG members hope that 
their research will decrease the 
number and severity of accidents 
in the United States: Currently, 
there are an estimated 43,900 
fatalities and 2.3 million inju­
ries on American roads annu­
ally. “When you think about driv­
ing, it’s a very complex function,” 
Guzman said. “We are human, 
and when we drive, we make 
mistakes. And mistakes lead 
to accidents.”
The American Automobile As­
sociation has cited driver fatigue 
as a factor in 41 to 59 percent of 
all heavy truck accidents. Based 
on these statistics, the Center 
plans to experiment with on­
board sensors that could provide 
drivers with a warning about po­
tential hazards. Using the simu­
lator, researchers can observe 
how their human subjects react 
to situations while fatigued and 
incorporate their observations 
into the on-board sensors.
“It’s clear that you can train 
someone’s reactions,” said Rich­
ard Grace, manager of the DRC. 
Grace hopes that the research 
done at the Center will allow 
trucking companies to train driv­
ers in as rigorous a fashion as 
today’s airplane pilots. “We’re 
very excited about [TruckSim]; 
the trucking industry is very in­
terested in this,” he said.

The Activities Board Carnival 
Committee has selected Jon Spen­
cer Blues Explosion to perform 
on Saturday April 18 for Spring 
Carnival. The decision was made 
in early March, but the deal has 
yet to be finalized.
“We have a lot of logistics to 
deal with before we know perfor­
mance times and other things 
like that,” said Joe Chellman, 
member of the Activities Board 
and junior psychology major. 
Timothy Warneck, Concert Com- 
mitte chairman and junior elec­
trical and computer engineering 
(ECE) major said that the con­
tract is still being negotiated but 
he is almost certain that the band 
will be playing.
The Concert Committee con­
sidered several other bands, re­
searching over 20 that were in 
their budget range and extend­
ing offers to six bands. “The key 
factor in our selection process
was availability of the bands,” 
Warneck said. He also said that 
the Committee has been work­
ing diligently since the begin­
ning of the second semester to 
book a band that would please 
the campus community. “My 
committee is a wide group of 
people with a great deal of differ­
ent interests. I feel they repre­
sent the interests of CMU stu­
dents well,” Warneck said.
The committee solicited input 
from non-committee members in 
making its decision. Warneck 
expressed some disappointment 
at not having attained a more 
well-known band but stated that 
the committee had done the best 
it could with the resources it had 
and that the committee as a whole 
is pleased with the choice.
Jon Spencer teamed up with 
guitarist Judah Bauer and drum­
mer Russell Simins in 1990 to 
create the Jon Spencer Blues Ex­
plosion, releasing the band’s self­
titled debut two years later. Since

U.N. inspectors find no 
banned weapons in Iraq
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - U.N. weap­
ons inspectors who completed the first 
inspections of Saddam Hussein’s 
palaces left Iraq on Saturday after 
failing to find any new evidence of 
banned materials.
They found no sign that Saddam 
was using the compounds to make 
chemical or biological weapons, 
said Roger Hill, the mission’s chief 
site inspector.
The inspectors had not expected to 
find anything incriminating at the 
palaces, which Iraq knew in advance 
would be searched. U.N. monitors had 
stressed repeatedly that they wanted 
to set a precedent of entering sites 
that Iraq had long said were off-limits.
That has been accomplished, said 
the mission’s leader, Charles Duelfer, 
who added, “We were able to conduct 
all the activities that we wanted.”
He did not rule out more detailed 
inspections in the future.
The mission was the first real test of 
a February 23 accord between Iraq 
and the United Nations that defused a 
potential military confrontation over 
the palaces, which Saddam had re­
fused to open to U.N. inspectors, citing 
national sovereignty.
About 50 arms monitors headed 
Saturday for the Iraqi air base of 
Habaniya, about 40 miles west of 
Baghdad, to fly to Bahrain. Twenty 
diplomats who joined them for the 
palace inspections — a requirement of 
the U.N. agreement — also left.
Hill said the diplomats had not hin­
dered the inspectors’ work. “We did all 
the things we normally do,” said Hill, 
who described the mission as a survey 
and not an exhaustive search.
Until inspectors confirm that Iraq 
has eliminated all its long-range mis­
siles and chemical, biological, and 
nuclear programs, the Security Coun­
cil will not lift economic sanctions 
imposed after Iraq’s 1990 invasion 
of Kuwait.
The United Nations made an ex­
ception to the sanctions in the oil- 
for-food program that allows Iraq to 
sell small amounts of oil to buy es­
sential supplies.
But a U.N. official said Saturday 
that Iraq is awarding food and 
humanitarian contracts in return 
for political support, and risks buy­
ing inferior goods with the limited 
money it has.
Antonio Monteiro, chairman of the 
U.N. Sanctions Committee, said Iraq 
should focus on getting “better 
contracts and those that serve the 
people better.”
Monteiro, whose committee evalu­
ates all contracts that Iraq awards for 
the goods, said he has warned Iraq 
about the political favoritism but did 
not say how he could stop it.
Last week, Iraqi Trade Minister 
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said pub­
licly that Iraq will continue to favor 
countries that support it politically.
In an interview with the Australian 
Broadcasting Corp. on Monday, Saleh 
warned that Iraq will reduce dairy 
and wheat imports from Australia if it 
does not withdraw its 200 soldiers 
from the Persian Gulf.
Russia, which is leading world ef­
forts to have the sanctions eased, has 
emerged as Iraq’s main trade partner, 
winning contracts worth $257 million 
this year. France, another sympathetic 
countiy, is second with contracts worth 
$110 million.
Meanwhile, U.S. exports to Iraq are 
declining and Britain has none. They 
have taken the hardest line in support 
of the U.N. inspectors who are search­
ing Iraq for evidence of biological and 
chemical weapons.
The oil-for-food program allowed 
Iraq to export $2 billion worth of oil 
every six months beginning in Janu­
ary 1997. The committee raised the 
limit to $5.2 billion for the phase that 
could begin in June.
Companies make 
fools of Americans
NEW YORK (AP) - Corporate April 
Fools’ Day pranks ran rampant last Tues­
day, as companies ranging from Burger 
King to Comedy Central played jokes on 
the unsuspecting American public.
Comedy Central was swamped by com­
plaints from “South Park” viewers after 
the network failed to reveal the father of 
Cartman as promised.
The April Fools’ idea was intended to 
poke fun at the concept of cliffhanger 
television. The joke wasn’t funny to the 
estimated 1,800 people who called or 
sent emails after the scatological car­
toon left them hanging Wednesday night.
“There were a lot of people who were 
crankier than we expected. But we still 
think it’s a good joke,” spokesman Tony 
Fox said.
The cable station promises — if you 
believe them this time — that Cartman’s 
dad will be revealed in May.
And no, PBS really isn’t plotting to 
take over Time Warner.
For anyone startled by Tuesday’s an­
nouncement, the Public Broadcasting 
System issued a clarification hours later 
explaining that its plan to lasso America’s 
largest media corporation was just a joke.
In that followup release, PBS apolo­
gized “for any misunderstanding.” Both 
were transmitted to news outlets via AP 
Express, a transmission service used to 
deliver non-Associated Press press re­
leases and other material.
Interviewed Wednesday afternoon, 
PBS director of corporate communica­
tions Stu Kantor took full responsibility 
(or was it proud credit?) for the ruse.
He said it was'he who composed the 
original statement, which explained 
PBS’ intention to raise “a hefty 11-fig- 
ure” purchase price through on-air 
pledge appeals. It invited Time Warner 
executives Gerald Levin and Ted Turner 
“to apply for positions in the new com­
pany.”
Kantor said the scheme had the full 
support of Ervin S. Duggan, PBS’ presi­
dent and chief executive officer. Lend­
ing support to this claim, Duggan was 
quoted in the phony release promising 
that PBS’ 349 member stations would
“get to pick which piece of Time Warner 
they will each control.”
The usually sober-minded PBS was 
just trying to “bring a smile or two to 
people’s faces,” Kantor explained. “I have 
heard from reporters, and people within 
public television and PBS, and they 
thought this was a hoot.”
But now that the idea has been 
broached, is PBS really ready to aban­
don a Time Warner buyout?
“Our doors are open to anyone with 
the resources or keen insight to help us 
follow through,” Kantor quipped.
And left-handed burger eaters would 
no longer be left out, if Burger King’s 
intentions hadn’t been humorous.
Burger King announced that it was to 
unwrap a left-handed Whopper that will 
look just like its regular burger, but will 
be made to fit more comfortably in the 
left hand.
The new Whopper was introduced in a 
full-page ad in Tuesday’s USA Today.
Burger King, in an estimate printed in 
the ad, claimed more than 32 million 
left-handed Americans could benefit 
from the reduced spillage effect of the 
southpaw sandwich.
Clinton pressures 
tobacco industry
WASHINGTON (AP) - President 
Clinton is stepping up pressure on ciga­
rette makers to go along with a tough 
Senate bill to protect children from the 
“cruel and deadly lure of smoking.”
For the third time this year, he took 
his case to the airwaves, using his weekly 
radio address today to argue once more 
that the tobacco industry should not be 
doing business with American kids.
“Reducing youth smoking must be 
everybody’s bottom line,” the president 
said. “We’re not trying to put the tobacco 
companies out of business. We want to 
put them out of the business of selling 
cigarettes to kids.”
Clinton’s comments today closed out a 
topsy-turvy week of action and threats on 
Capitol Hill, where the Senate Commerce 
Committee approved legislation that 
would cost tobacco companies $506 billion 
over 25 years, increase cigarette prices by 
$1.10 per pack by 2003, and force changes 
in cigarette advertising practices.
The bill, retooled right up until its 
unveiling and ultimately approved 19- 
1, is much tougher on the industry than 
the proposed settlement negotiated with 
40 state attorneys general last June. 
Once the politically popular bill cleared 
its first hurdle Wednesday, tobacco com­
panies balked and warned that the added 
costs could bankrupt thé industry.
Even as Clinton offered assurances to­
day that he didn’t want to see them put 
wholly out of business, he made clear 
that he and like-minded lawmakers hold 
the upper hand. “This week’s progress in 
the Senate shows that we have real mo­
mentum in both parties” to stop tobacco 
companies from selling to minors and to 
protect them from the “cruel and deadly 
lure of smoking,” he said.
U.N. urges end 
to death penalty
GENEVA (AP) - The U.N. Commis­
sion on Human Rights on Friday urged 
abolition of the death penalty globally, 
while one of its top investigators criti­
cized executions in the United States.
The United States joined 13 other coun­
tries in opposing the death penalty reso­
lution at the annual session of the 53- 
member commission in Geneva. Twenty- 
six countries voted in favor, and 12 gov­
ernments abstained.
George Moose, U.S. Ambassador to 
the United Nations in Geneva, said the 
United States could not support the reso­
lution because a majority of states had 
chosen to keep the death penalty.
However, the United States respected 
the decisions of many countries to abol­
ish the death penalty, he said.
Also Friday, a top U.N. investigator 
said the way the death penalty is ap­
plied in the. United States violates sev­
eral international treaties.
Waly Bacre Ndiaye, a Senegalese ex­
pert on executions who visited death 
rows in the United States, said the use of 
the death penalty “seems to continue to 
be marked by arbitrariness.”
He said race, ethnic origin, and eco­
nomic status are key to determining 
who is put to death — as is politics, 
especially during election campaigns.
Nidiaye issued a report to the commis­
sion just before it passed the resolution.Microphone will accompany next mission to Mars’ polar ice cap
BERKELEY, California (AP) - 
You’ve seen the pictures of the 
red and rocky surface of the pla­
net Mars. Now get ready for 
the soundtrack.
Scientists at the University of 
California, Berkeley, have de­
signed a microphone that will ride 
along on NASA’s Mars Polar 
Landing mission in 1999.
The goal: a space sound-bite — 
perhaps the hiss of the wind or 
the crackle of an electrical dis­
charge — that could speak vol­
umes about the Red Planet. 
They’re not sure exactly what they 
will hear.
“We certainly don’t expect to 
hear little green men or any kind 
of life crawling around but in the 
idea of having our ears open just 
like we’ve had our eyes open, you 
don’t know what you’ll hear in
terms of natural sounds,” said 
Louis Friedman, executive direc­
tor of the Planetary Society, which 
is funding the project.
“We’re adding a whole new 
sense ... now we’re going to have 
hearing and I think that’s going 
to make it more of a world for us 
to try to understand and enjoy,” 
he said.
The Planetary Society, 100,000 
members strong and dedicated to 
exploring the solar system and 
searching for extraterrestrial life, 
was founded by the late Carl 
Sagan, Friedman, and space sci­
entist Bruce Murray.
Sagan, a Cornell University as­
tronomer whose PBS series Cos­
mos in 1980 made him a celeb­
rity, wrote to NASA in 1996 sug­
gesting that they mike a Mars 
mission.
“Even if only a few minutes of 
Martian sounds are recorded from 
this first experiment, the public 
interest will be high, and the op­
portunity for scientific explora­
tion real,” wrote Sagan, who died 
later that year.
The microphone was developed 
for the society by University of 
California at Berkeley scientists 
Janet Luhmann, Dave Curtis and 
Greg Delory.
Getting the microphone on 
board, the Mars Polar Lander 
where space is at a premium 
was a tough sell. But officials 
wére won over when a Russian 
team agreed to incorporate 
the microphone into its lidar 
instrument already approved for 
the mission.
The lidar, a form of laser that 
will scan the atmosphere for
dust and aerosols, will be the 
first Russian instrument to fly 
aboard a U.S. planetary mis­
sion. The instrument was built 
by the Russian Space Research 
Institute. The collaboration 
stems from the “Mars To­
gether” agreement signed in 
1994 by Vice President A1 Gore 
and Russian Prime Minister 
Victor Chernomyrdin.
The Mars Polar Lander will be 
launched in January 1999 and 
is supposed to land in December 
near an ice-sheathed Martian 
polar cap. Using a robotic 
arm, the probe will dig up soil 
and study its chemical and 
mineral features.
The Mars microphone was con­
structed of largely off-the-shelf 
parts, including a microphone 
similar to those used in hearing
aids. Friedman estimated that 
the total cost of the project is 
under $100,000.
The thumbnail-sized micro­
phone is in a device that weighs 
less than 50 grams and uses 
about one-tenth of a watt in 
power, said UC Berkeley space 
physicist Delory.
The mike can be triggered ran­
domly by naturally occurring 
sounds, or can be programmed to 
listen to specific lander actions, 
such as when the robotic arm 
digs in the soil.
If all goes well, the microphone 
will eventually send back sound 
in short bursts of 10 seconds 
or so.
“The mike itself seems pretty 
rugged,” he said. “We learned 
what its limits were. You can 
drop it, you can shake it, you can
kick it around. You can’t dip it in 
alcohol, we found out, and you 
can’t bake it too hot.”
Last summer, the Mars Path­
finder and its little rover, So­
journer, electrified the nation 
with pictures and chemical analy­
ses of Mars. Sojourner rolled 
about300 feet and took more than 
500 pictures before the lander 
lost contact with Earth in Octo­
ber. The lander snapped more 
than 16,000 images.
Friedman hopes that the 
sounds of Mars will also find 
an audience.
“Mars is a fascinating world,” 
he said. “Mars is the place where 
we will determine our future as a 
multiplanetary species. If we 
don’t settle there, it’s probably 
pretty gloomy we (will) settle 
anywhere else.”

50 YEARS AGO, April 6,1948
— Student Council’s constitution 
was under the scrutiny by five 
council members who were respon­
sible for preparing recommenda­
tions for revisions to the general 
Student Council body. The consti­
tution, which hadn’t been revised 
in three years, should have been 
subject to revision every two years, 
according to committee chair Bill 
Johns. Some of the considered 
changes included provision 
for preferential voting and 
allowing an outside organization 
to assist Student Council in 
conducting elections.
25 YEARS AGO, April 10,1973
— The CMU Activities Board was 
to try for the third time to stage a 
concert featuring Focus. The con­
cert originally was to be held on 
March 21, but was postponed a 
day to allow the band to tape a
performance for television. The 
concert was pushed back to March 
22, but the band didn’t show, leav­
ing an auditorium of anxious lis­
teners disappointed, and the Ac­
tivities Board lost $3047. The di­
rector of the Activities Board, 
dazed by the band’s lack of com­
mitment, was unsure if the band 
would actually show up for the 
re:rescheduled performance on 
April 12.
10 YEARS AGO, March 22, 
1988 — The Carnegie Mellon 
Health Center conducted a cam­
pus-wide immunization for 
measles after two cases of the 
disease were confirmed the pre­
vious week before. The immuni­
zation cost the state health de­
partment an estimated $100,000. 
Residents in Donner Hall, where 
the afflicted students lived, were 
immunized first.
FIVE YEARS AGO, April 5, 
1993 — The student body presi­
dent, Natalie Gesmond, resigned 
from her position at a Student 
Senate meeting before the gov­
erning body could begin impeach­
ment hearings for her. The pro­
ceedings were to begin because of 
Gesmond’s alleged lack of duty 
performance and violation of the 
bylaws of the Student Body.
However, Gesmond, in her letter 
to Senate, stated that she was not 
resigning due to her impeachment, 
but instead because of “the petti­
ness and irresponsible actions of 
Student Senate.” She claimed that 
the reason for her not being able to 
attend her mandatoy meetings was 
that she had been hospitalized. 
However, Senators did not believe 
this to be a valid excuse. One said, 
“If Gesmond knew she would not 
be able to attend meetings, she 
should have resigned before.”
ONE YEAR AGO, April 7,1997
— The College of Fine Arts, can­
celed its traditional biennial 
Beaux Arts Ball. Administrative 
approval for the event was needed 
eight weeks in advance due to its 
magnitude —. something the com­
mittee was not aware of. Even 
though the ball was completely 
organized — with DJs, comedi­
ans, and other performing artists 
scheduled to appear — there was 
not enough time to seek approval. 
The ball had to be cancelled.
Students expressed disappoint­
ment towards the turn of events, 
but the committee assured the 
campus community that the ball 
would be held in 1998. However, 
it was not organized this year, 
and the future of the Beaux Arts 
Ball is in doubt.

and sororities are gender-exclu­
sive organizations, some students 
argue that this should prevent
them from receiving funding, 
since it has historically been con­
sidered a violation of the State­
ment of Assurances.
A senator who wished to re­
main anonymous pointed out 
that funded recognition was dif­
ferent from non-funded recogni­
tion — which exclusive organi­
zations currently have, so 
they can use campus 
spaces — and the impor­
tance of maintaining this 
distinction. “I can’t say 
how the committee’s 
findings will be received, 
only that they will be 
taken seriously. But I get the 
feeling that it doesn’t have over­
whelming support,” said the 
senator. “Recognition is also not 
allowed by current policy, as it 
enables organizations to ask 
for special allocations and such, 
despite being non-funded. 
This is one of the reasons that 
Senate doesn’t recognize exclu­
sive organizations.”

Crime and Incident Report
The English Dept, presents the first 
Carol Brown undergraduate lecture:
3/19 MEDICAL, 10:55 pm - A 
student who was bicycling along 
the sidewalk near West Wing fell 
when his chain slipped a gear. 
His forehead struck the curb, 
causing a 1/2 inch gash and mi­
nor scrapes on his right elbow 
and knee. Student EMS re­
sponded and applied gauze to his 
forehead. The victim was then 
transported to Presbyterian Hos­
pital by Campus Police.
3/20 VANDALISM, 10:18 am
— A staff member’s car was 
parked behind Smith Hall. When 
he was returned to his car to go 
home, he saw that someone had 
used their finger to write in the 
grime covering her rear fender 
the words, “Wash me, [name de­
leted].” The next day he noticed 
that the clear coat finish on his 
car had been scratched by the 
writing, so he contacted Campus 
Police about the damage.
3/20 CREDIT CARD FRAUD,
3:10 pm — A CMU student re­
ceived her bank statement from. 
National City Bank. On it she 
saw two ATM withdrawals total­
ing $350 that she did not make. 
She felt the bank may have made 
a mistake, so she went there to 
clear it up. The teller informed 
her that the transactions were 
indeed made with the student’s 
ATM card and personal identifi­
cation number [PIN].
When the student said that she 
did not make the withdrawals, 
the teller brought up pictures 
taken by the ATM of the person 
making the withdrawal. The stu­
dent instantly recognized the per­
petrator as a hallmate and friend 
of hers.
Later that day she contacted 
Campus Police about the inci­
dent, and an officer responded to 
her More wood Gardens residence. 
She told the officer that her 
“friend” had been with her on 
several occasions when she had 
used her ATM card. She believed 
that her friend watched her enter 
her PIN and then used it without 
her knowledge. The officer ad­
vised her not to confront her 
friend, but instead let a Campus 
Police detective do the follow-up.
3/22 MEDICAL, 12:36 am - A 
student stubbed his left big toe on 
a bed frame in his Resnik Hall 
residence. The toe nail had been 
almost completely pulled off his 
toe. Campus Police provided 
transportation to University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center after 
EMS bandaged his toe.
3/23 THEFT, 10:17 pm - A 
complainant contacted Campus 
Police to report the vandalism of 
a Doherty Hall soda machine. 
Someone had poured a salt solu­
tion into the money slot, causing 
the machine to dispense over two 
cases of soda. An “out of order” 
sign was placed on the machine 
until repairs could be made.
3/23 FAKE ID & FORGERY,
6:27 pm — On March 5, a Cam­
pus Police detective received a 
letter and photographs from York
Bank. The photographs were of 
someone who had cashed a forged 
check at the bank. The detective 
showed the photos to other offic­
ers, two of whom recognized the 
person in the pictures as a CMU 
student who has a history with 
Campus Police.
On March 23, the student had 
to attend a hearing concerning 
the fake identification that had 
allowed him to cash the checks 
and that Campus Police had con­
fiscated in February. He was 
found guilty and fined $100 plus 
$34.50 in court costs. Later that 
day, the CMU detective contacted 
the York Bank loss prevention 
representative to inform him of 
the day’s proceedings. The repre­
sentative told him that because 
of the amount of the forged check, 
the bank would not be prosecut­
ing the student for forgery.
3/25 THEFT, 7:20 am - An 
officer was stopped by the man­
ager of the Main Street Market in 
Wean Hall. He informed the of­
ficer that over the night, some­
one had taken 30 beverages from 
an unlocked cooler, an unsecured 
microwave from behind the 
counter, and a case of potato chips 
that was sitting atop the micro­
wave. The total value of the sto­
len goods was $184.
The manager also informed the 
officer that this was the second 
theft in the past few weeks, and 
that both thefts occurred on a 
night when CPS cleaned behind 
the counter. He explained that 
his crews clean the floor daily, 
but when the floors need a good 
cleaning, he rolls up the mats, 
indicating to CPS that they need 
to clean the floors. The manager 
stated that he would contact 
someone in Dining Services about 
the incident.
3/25 MEDICAL CALL, 9:20 
am — While on bike patrol, a 
CMU officer encountered a non­
affiliate and his mother outside 
of Tech Garage. The boy was cry­
ing, bleeding from his mouth, and 
being comforted by his mother. 
The woman requested that CMU 
EMS be notified to take a look at 
her son. She stated that he had 
had oral surgery the week before 
and had accidentally walked into 
a wall, triggering the bleeding. 
EMS provided the boy with an ice 
pack, and the woman then drove 
him to their family dentist.
3/27 INCIDENT, 11:00 am - 
A Hamerschlag House Resident 
Assistant phoned Campus Police, 
saying that he had been given a 
bag of what appeared to be mari­
juana. One of his resident’s girl­
friends had found the bag in the 
women’s restroom in the resi­
dence hall. An officer responded 
to the RA’s room, took the bag, 
and conducted a narcotics ID sys­
tem test which proved negative. 
The substance was disposed of by 
the officer.

AB selects top Carnival band
Committee expects an explosive performance
BAND, from page 1
then, the band has released a 
total of four albums, each 
achieving more popularity 
than its predecessor. With 
their 1993 release Extra Width, 
Jon Spencer Blues Explosion 
finally earned recognition from 
MTV, receiving coverage of 
their video for “Afro” on 120 
Minutes. Orange followed in 
1994, and their latest album, 
Now I Got Worry, was released 
by Capitol Records in 1996.
Jon Spencer Blues Explosion 
is actually post-modern “anti­
rock” with a 70s’ flare rather 
than typical blues. Erica Vogel,
a sophomore english major ac­
quainted with the band’s music, 
describes their sound as being 
influenced by old Blues artists 
rather than being strictly Blues. 
The band acknowledges that the 
Rolling Stones have been a strong 
influence on its musical style.
“They kick ass,” said Vogel. I 
love them. I’m very happy that 
they are coming to Carnival.”
Upon hearing of the 
committee’s selection, students 
were either very excited or indif­
ferent because of unfamiliarity 
with the band. “Woohoo!” ex­
claimed April Dupont, sophomore 
ethics, history, and public policy
major. “Now, who are they?”
“[The band will be] a nice 
contrast to the two more jazzy 
groups that we already booked,” 
said junior computer science 
major Evan Bernstein.
The other Carnival groups 
are Galactic and Charlie 
Hunter & Pound for Pound, 
both of which will perform dur­
ing the daytime on April 18.
“I’m expecting it to a be d ay of 
the best music that AB has 
brought to this campus in a 
long time,” said Bernstein.
[Ed. note: Erica Vogel is a 
Tartan Junior Staffwriter.]

home at the time. Ratnakar added 
that he did not know the location 
from which his son had been trans­
ported to the hospital, nor any of 
the circumstances surrounding his 
being in the North Hills.
Bipin’s brother, Dilip, a senior 
mechanical engineering major, 
said he first learned something

after one of his classes. Dilip re­
ceived an email message from his 
roommate that his father had

Simulation drives researchers wild
Michelle Unger/Tartan Photo Staff
Students test drive the l-Sim driving simulator that CMU researchers will use to study driving accidents.
last Thursday. “It probably won’t 
kick in until I get back to my 
normal routine.”
“It was totally unexpected. 
Everyone’s a wreck right now 
because he was our best friend,” 
said Wayne Cha-Fong, a sopho­
more industrial management 
(IM) major who lived across the 
hall from Bipin.
Cha-Fong and other friends of 
Bipin describe him as a very funny 
person. “He had kind of this abil­
ity of making anyone laugh,” said 
Benjamin Lyon, a freshman elec­
trical and computer engineering 
(ECE) major, while standing on 
the sidewalk covered with mes­
sages to Bipin.
Lyon said he did not buy into 
the rumors of suicide circulating 
around the campus. “I saw him 
pretty late the night before [his 
death]. Everything seemed com­
pletely fine.... [Suicide] is not 
impossible, but it’s not the going 
theory [among his friends].” '
Mujumdar’s funeral was held 
last Saturday morning at the 
Beinhauer funeral home.
SIMULATOR, from page 1
TruckSim has been designed 
by Carnegie Mellon and I-Sim 
Corporation, a leading developer 
and manufacturer of driver simu­
lation equipment. The simulator, 
which will include an actual 
Freightliner truck cab, is cur­
rently under construction at the 
company’s facilities in Utah.
Last Thursday and Friday, stu­
dents had the opportunity to test 
I-Sim’s technology near the Uni­
versity Center loading dock. 
Those who test-drove the Ford 
Ranger cab were subjected to the 
full range of elements while oth­
ers were able to participate in a 
simulated police car chase in 
which the driver attempted to 
apprehend a reckless driver.
Some students had problems 
driving the simulator. “It was 
pretty cool, but my big problem 
was that it didn’t feel like you 
were moving quickly. I thought I 
was doing maybe 50, but when I 
looked down at the spedometer I 
saw that I was going 110,” said 
sophomore electrical and comput­
er engineering major Bemie Behn.
“You knew they were messing 
with you,” said Lia Rozmiarek, a 
sophomore professional writing
major, referring to the fact that 
the controller of the simulator 
would often take control of other 
vehicles on the virtual road and 
swerve them into your car.
Susan Redmond, one of the tech­
nicians who was runningthe simu­
lator on Friday, said that I-Sim’s 
products have the potential to 
train new drivers of all sorts of 
vehicles — from police cars to 
ambulances to garbage trucks.
The Center, according to Dr. 
Gerard Mayer, Senior Advisor for 
Business and Development at the 
AATG, hopes to reduce 10 percent 
of fatalities in Pennsylvania.
Corrections/Clarifications...
In Issue 20, the article titled “Vandal ruins exhibit” states that the involved CFA professors 
wished to meet together with the dean of CFA to prepare a statement before providing a response. 
However, the Wats:on? vandalism story was covered in two separate Tartan articles, one of which 
the professors commented for. The Tartan assumed that the comments were only intended for the 
article “Students hope to expose stereotypical attitudes.” The comments should have been cited 
in both articles.
Also, in the Issue 20 article, “Student art exhibits connect disciplines,” the sculpture pictured that 
is based on Utopia was created by Ricardo Miranda. The architectural structure was built by 
students Eric Malo and Helena Broad. Rachel Matthews did not participate in the exhibit.

Dining options should 
cater to student needs
Many students who remained 
on campus during spring break 
experienced a problem that the 
CMU community has faced for 
some time now — the limitations 
of dining options and hours. It is 
common for many food vendors to 
be closed concurrently during the 
academic year, especially during 
evenings and weekends. This 
problem cannot be overlooked any 
longer. Steps need to be taken to 
improve Dining Services at CMU.
There was a time when CMU 
had two major dining areas: High­
lander and Pipers’ Cafe. Their 
locations were convenient for both 
residents of the Hill and residents 
of Suite Side, with Highlander 
located in West Wing and Pipers 
situated on the ground floor of 
Morewood Gardens. But then the 
UC food court opened and Pipers 
was closed. Dining Services’ as­
sumption that the UC food ven­
dors would compensate for the 
absence of Pipers was an errone­
ous one — the ambiance, service, 
hours, and menus that the two 
establishments provided served 
the campus more effectively than 
the current combination of High­
lander and UC food vendors.
Add to this the fluctuating hours 
of operation of UC food vendors 
and the result is an inadequate 
amount of dining options as well 
as unreasonable hours. One prob­
lem with eating mainly at the 
UC, is that places like Pipers 
provided a better social atmo­
sphere while at the same time 
giving students the option to eat 
healthier, well-balanced meals. To
a lesser degree, Highlander still 
provides these things, but 
without the ambiance and 
well-rounded a la carte menu 
of Pipers.
But it seems now that High­
lander is on its way out as well, 
since it has been announced that 
the dining area will be closed this 
summer. If the reason for the clo­
sure, as well as the shortened UC 
food vendor hours, is primarily 
financial, better money manage­
ment on the part of Dining Ser­
vices is in order. Currently, there 
is no official Director of Dining 
and Hospitality Services. When 
someone new takes over this posi­
tion, these issues must be ad­
dressed appropriately.
If it is determined that there is 
no way to expand on-campus eat­
eries or operating hours, then 
Dining Services should explore 
the option of allowing students to 
use their meal plan money off- 
campus. While students have 
heard about the plans to expand 
Campus Xpress to off-campus es­
tablishments, they are still wait­
ing to see when this change will 
happen and how it will affect 
them. Dining Services is suppos­
edly in the process of expanding 
options, and students would ben­
efit from periodic updates.
Dining Services has seen many 
changes in the past few years, 
from contractor takeovers to new 
facilities. But the one element that 
Dining Services seems to over­
look consistently is its effective­
ness in serving its customers, pri­
marily, the students.
TAs need improved evaluation system
Last month, the Eberly Center 
for Teaching Excellence presented 
an exceptional idea to the Gradu­
ate Student Association (GSA) — 
restructuring teaching assistant 
(TA) evaluations. As of now, the 
generic Faculty Course Evalua­
tions (FCE) are the primary way 
in which students are asked for 
feedback about all aspects of the 
course, including TAs. However, 
this one document does not offer 
enough opportunity to give ad­
equate information concerning 
one of the more important as­
pects of a course — the TA.
The improvement of the quality 
of recitations and extra help from 
TAs depends primarily on stu­
dent feedback. Therefore, restruc­
turing the evaluations to allow 
for specific improvements on TA 
performance is necessary.
Through recitations and office 
hours, TAs are there to offer more 
personal and specialized instruc­
tion, clearing up what a professor 
may have lectured to a room of 
200 students. Without qualified 
TAs, this important aspect of uni­
versity learning is lost. However, 
most of the time, TAs are teach­
ing for the first time and may not 
know the best ways to communi­
cate to a group of students. Al­
though graduate student TAs usu­
ally know more before they assist 
a course, most undergraduate TAs 
do not have the advantage of ad­
vanced field experience. There­
fore, formal student feedback is 
vital to the TA as well as the

Letter to
Editor:
Being an alum of 
CMU, I was very 
pleased to see that thethe Editor CMUObjectivistClub
was able to bring the renowned Objec- 
tivist philosopher Andrew Bernstein to 
CMU. I was also happily surprised to see 
The Tartan doing a story on the event 
[“Club brings Objectivist philosophy to 
CMU community,” 3/16/98].
However, I was disappointed at the 
hostile nature of the questions Dr. 
Bernstein had to endure. I was espe­
cially disturbed to hear students attack­
ing Andrew Carnegie. They must have 
forgotten that it was Mr. Carnegie who 
made their education at CMU possible 
and was also largely responsible for the 
growth of Pittsburgh. To damn Carnegie 
and to defend Mother Teresa, a woman 
who believed that without the poor, 
morality would be impossible, is intel­
lectually dishonest.
Dr. Bernstein presented Ayn Rand’s 
identification of the nature of human 
life and what it requires to flourish. I

“making a mockery of Irish culture” on 
St. Patrick’s Day, [“American celebra­

yet he doesn’t seem to have much aware­
ness of how this day is celebrated in 
Ireland. St. Patrick’s Day is a celebra­
tion of Ireland and being Irish, not sim­
ply “a day honoring a saint” and more 
akin to Independence Day in the U.S. in 
that sense.
Rather than dedicating the day to “re­
flections with the family and maybe go- Gail LaPaglia
ing to Mass,” it is marked by parades, 
fireworks, and revelry. It is misleading 
to claim that one is “insulting an entire 
nation by running around with green 
beer and leprechaun socks” when nei­
ther of these practices would be uncom­
mon in Dublin on March 17. The spirit of 
an occasion such as this is to welcome 
any and all who wish to get involved.
I find it ironic the Irish need folks such 
as Mr. Brindle to provide our conscience 
while we run around insulting ourselves 
on our national holiday.

student. In addition, setting 
a minimum proficiency level 
based on the evaluations will 
motivate the TAs to take the forms 
more seriously.
Currently, there are a few pro­
fessors who distribute their own 
TA evaluations in their courses. 
This action should be commended, 
yet the initiative of these profes­
sors proves the inefficiency of us­
ing the current FCEs to evaluate 
TAs. Hopefully, these new evalu­
ations will be used as a Univer- 
sity-wide resource so that all 
courses benefit, not just the few 
who already use this method.
One aspect that the Eberly Cen­
ter should consider for their pro­
posal is when the evaluations 
should be distributed. For FCEs, 
evaluating the course at the end 
of the term may be a great way to 
get complete feedback for the next 
semester. Although most faculty 
members stay put, TAs do not 
necessarily teach again. For indi­
vidual TAs to work as effectively 
as possible, their evaluations 
should be distributed before the 
midpoint of the course to allow for 
improvement to begin within that 
same semester.
The restructuring of TA evalua­
tions to allow for more specific and 
effective feedback is a movement 
that has been needed for quite a 
while. The University depart­
ments and administration should 
embrace this opportunity to im­
prove upon one of the more impor­
tant aspects of student learning.
Arkansas shootings reflect blindness

that has surrounded the 
middle school murders in 
Jonesboro, Arkansas on 
March 23 — which were com­
mitted by an 11-year-old and 
a 13-year-old — I have yet to 
see any discussion among 
the experts about what these 
killers could have been 
thinking at the time they - 
committed the act. 4
It may be true that at 
this point any discus­
sion of this would only be 
speculation, since no one 
from the media has 
talked with the boys. But 
even without much “evi- ¦ 
dence,” an earnest attempt 
at understanding what 
these children might have 
been going through at the 
time the trigger was pulled 
might be a useful imagina­
tive exercise.
The question that popped 
into my mind — and, I would 
imagine, everyone else’s — 
when news of this tragedy 
first broke was “How could 
this have happened?” This 
is an important question for 
us to try to answer.
But the media — and per­
haps we ourselves — have 
approached this question 
from the outside-in rather 
than the inside-out. All the 
discussion I’ve seen skirts 
the real issue. We ask if vio­
lence in the media is to blame, 
as if these kids were monkey- 
seeing, monkey-doing the 
whole way, caught in some 
tragic cultural pantomime. 
We implicate law enforce­
ment, saying we should have 
paid attention to the warn­
ing signs to begin with.
One police officer said this 
incident was a sign that we 
needed to be more watchful 
in the future, so we could 
weed out and “separate” 
problematic members of
events leading up to the mur­
ders — the stealing of the guns 
and the van, the threats made 
the day before, the pulling of 
the fire alarm — but invari­
ably in the retelling of the 
murders themselves, the kill­
ers disappear. Focus shifts 
solely to the victims, and the 
bullets seem to come from an 
inhuman source.
Of course, attention should 
be given to the victims. But if 
we don’t try to imagine what 
was going on in the kil-
“Why [these two children] made the 
decision they did, willfully and within 
themselves, should be the central 
question we are puzzling over. ”

Both of these explanations of the moment and what made

be pretty obvious: that these 
murders were carried out not 
only against human beings 
but also by human beings.
These children decided to 
do what they did; they might 
have just as easily not de­
cided to do it. Why they made 
the decision they did, will­
fully and within themselves, 
should be the central ques­
tion we are puzzling over.
I have read articles and 
seen countless television pro­
grams that attempt to nar­
rate the act. All of them talk 
at great length about the
So let’s attempt to speculate 
a little here. You’re one of these 
boys. You’ve done all the plan­
ning, stolen all the guns and 
ammo and hunting knives, and 
pulled the fire alarm. You wait 
outside and see the children 
filing out at a comfortable dis­
tance, 50 yards away. What 
makes the pulling of that trig­
ger bearable?
The only explanation I can 
think of is that, in a sense, 
these children did not see the 
people at which they were 
shooting. Had they recognized 
in their targets at that mo­
ment something akin to them­
selves, had they recognized in 
themselves the potential for 
being exposed to the same type 
of horror they were about to 
inflict, I don’t believe they could 
have gone through with pull­
ing the trigger.
Their interests were not in 
killing people, but in blindly 
killing. They fell in love with 
an idea.
They did not merely prepare 
to commit an efficient murder
— they stole far more guns than 
they needed, for one thing — 
but to complete the image 
these children were creat­
ing in their minds.
It is important to note that 
the blindness of these chil­
dren was voluntary. It is the 
same voluntary blindness
¦ adults often adopt in war, 
abstracting the faces of the en­
emy to such a point that shoot­
ing at them is tantamount to 
target practice.
Why these children chose not 
to see the humanity of their 
targets in this case is uncer­
tain, but I think we can all 
guess how it happened.
It’s always easier to catego­
rize, to make abstract, and yes, 
to “separate,” than it is to un­
derstand. How much more com­
fortable is it, for instance, to 
think of these killers as mon­
sters or robots than 11- or 13- 
year-olds, as all of us once were? 
In a sense, we as adults are 
guilty of the same voluntary 
blindness these children are 
guilty of.

Tobacco cutdown bill leaves writers inflamed
Regulations impede civil liberties
OPEN FORUM
by Lorelei Laird
Smoking kills you.
I’m assuming that this is not news to 
you. Even the tobacco companies, much 
as they try to deny it, know it by now. 
Congress certainly knows it, and they’ve 
been falling all over themselves trying 
to balance big-money tobacco interests 
with the interests of powerful cancer 
lobbyists and their own urge to posture 
about “protecting the children.” The bill 
that Arizona’s Senator McCain recently 
introduced is just the latest example. 
Purporting to fight the evils of underage 
smoking, this bill would add a whopping 
$1.10 in taxes to each pack of cigarettes 
in the next five years, using the profits to 
pay for reform programs and subsidize 
tobacco farmers. It will also fine tobacco 
companies large sums of money if teen­
age smoking levels do not drop 60 per­
cent in the next 10 years.
The crimes against the free market in 
this bill are so numerous and obvious 
that I’m surprised a Republican proposed 
it. To begin with, the idea of taxing to­
bacco companies on the basis of other 
people’s actions is ludicrous. Not that 
they probably couldn’t afford it, but it’s 
wrong to hold people responsible for ac­
tions over which they have little control. 
There’s really no clear way tobacco com­
panies can stop teenagers from smoking, 
short of going out of business. Individual 
smokers make the decision to smoke; R. 
J. Reynolds doesn’t round up gaggles of 
13-year-olds and hold them captive until 
they’ve each smoked a pack of Marlboros.
There is a tendency among liberals 
and conservatives alike to villanize Big 
Tobacco, as if these companies are merely 
profitable fronts through which Old 
Scratch himself works to kill and cor­
rupt the innocent. Sure, smoking is bad, 
but that’s not a reason to charge tobacco 
companies for every unfavorable effect 
of smoking, regardless of whether they’re 
directly responsible.
And then there’s the issue of the gov­
ernment policing morality. The logic be­
hind this bill seems to be that since smok­
ing is bad, let’s get the smokers, and if we 
make it burdensome enough for them to
continue their nasty habit, they’ll stop. 
Being anti-smoking is in vogue right now 
in Washington. But what if, suddenly, 
Washington decides that being anti-Is­
lam is fashionable? Or anti-potato, or anti­
dog ownership? If it’s okay for the govern­
ment to police some of our habits just 
because they’re harmful, what’s to stop it 
from policing any habit it decides it doesn’t 
like? The entire state of California, more 
or less, is already non-smoking. If we don’t 
protect our civil liberties, even those we 
don’t necessarily agree with, it will let the 
government think it can take more and 
more of them away.
Last, but far from least, this bill places 
an undue burden on smokers themselves. 
These people 
don’t smoke be­
cause they think 
it’s going to im­
prove their eye­
sight — they’re 
addicted, and as 
long as they can 
afford to buy ciga­
rettes, they’re go­
ing to. Why 
should they have 
to bear the finan­
cial burden of 
government anti- 
tobacco pro­
grams, many of 
which they will 
never use? It’s a little like lending afriend 
your baseball and finding out that he 
broke a window with it — now, not only is 
your baseball lost, but you have to pay for 
the window. Again, this is a clear case of 
holding people responsible for something 
over which they have no control, and that’s 
no less wrong just because these people 
happen to be smokers.
The most-cited difference between the 
United States and many other countries 
is our guaranteed civil liberties. Any his­
tory student worth his or her salt cer­
tainly knows better than to believe that 
that’s been true in every case, but that’s 
all the more reason to correct ourselves 
by not doing anything to damage what 
civil liberties we do enjoy. The principle 
at stake here is not the value of smoking, 
but rather the right to do so. Every per­
son should be able to make decisions for 
himself or herself, regardless of whether 
they’re wise decisions.

OPEN FORUM
by Abhay Agrawal
A battle is raging with the tobacco in­
dustry on one side and the U. S. Senate, 
the state of Minnesota, insurance com­
panies, and numerous others on the 
other side.
The issue of freedom of tobacco use is 
complex. Any fifth grader 
knows that smoking is 
harmful to the health. It 
is well-known through 
countless studies that 
smoking causes lung can­
cer, cardiovascular dis­
eases, respiratory dis­
eases, and a myriad of 
other illnesses. The Cen­
ter for Disease Control 
(CDC) reports that 
400,000 Americans die 
each year due to smok­
ing cigarettes.
It is reasonable to argue 
that tobacco companies 
Mohd Zekri Ismail/Tartan Junior Staff cannotbeheldresponsible 
for the various ailments that people suffer 
from smoking cigarettes, since they 
make the conscious decision of smoking 
and choose to ignore the dangers of 
doing so.
However, the issue is not quite as 
simple as that. For one, cigarettes con­
tain nicotine, which is a stimulant and, 
most importantly, is addictive. This is 
what makes smoking a habit and makes 
it difficultfor people to quit smoking once 
they have started. The addictive effects 
of nicotine are exploited by the industry, 
and used by it to increase the sale of 
cigarettes. Nicotine has harmful effects 
on the body. In that respect, it is just like 
one of the illegal narcotic drugs such as 
cocaine or heroine. Therefore, we should 
have a ban on nicotine also.
Cigarette companies also target young 
children and hook them on- smoking. 
These companies entice young people, 
who are at an susceptible stage of their 
lives and are perhaps not mature enough 
to decide rationally the possible conse­
quences of their actions.
The debate between individuals’ free 
will to smoke and the dangers of addic­
tion make for a complex issue. The McCain 
bill, which has now been passed to the full 
Senate, imposes harsher restrictions on 
the tobaccco industry than the bill passed 
last June. But, once again the bill pro­
poses to make the industry pay $516 
billion over 25 years and forces it to re­
duce the incidence of youth smoking with 
the threat of further fines. The bill fails to 
drive the knife to the heart. If the govern­
ment is really concerned about the haz­
ards of tobacco on the people, it shouldn't 
stop at simply fining the industry. It needs 
to do a complete ban on tobacco. Half­
hearted measures like this one speak of 
nothing but hypocrisy.
The state of Minnesota and Blue Cross- 
Blue Shield of Minnesota are seeking 
$1.77 billion in actual damages and bil­
lions more in punitive sanctions against 
companies to recover taxpayers’ money 
spent to treat illnesses they claim were 
caused by cigarette smoking. On March 
27, the Minnesota Supreme Court or­
dered the release of 3^,000 documents on 
industry trade secrets that would throw 
light on the tobacco industry’s critical 
marketing strategies.
What is going to happen after the in­
dustry pays and releases the documents? 
They will still be allowed to sell ciga­
rettes. They can still rake in the millions 
they did before. The government is taking 
a very hypocritical stance — they’re ask­
ing the industry to pay up, and then 
allowing them to continue selling ciga­
rettes. This doesn’t seem right.
Almost one year ago, a so-called “land­
mark” settlement was made that would 
end 40 state lawsuits and would require 
the tobacco companies to pay $368 bil­
lion over 25 years and curb their mar­
keting practices. The only thing that is 
landmark about this settlement is its 
hypocrisy.
The government needs to make up its 
mind. If it thinks cigarettes are bad, then 
it should ban them totally. If it thinks 
cigarettes are okay, then it should leave 
the companies alone.
Curbing marketing strategies and al­
lowing the companies to produce ciga­
rettes is a waste. People will still die of 
smoking-related illnesses. Taxpayers’ 
money will still go into smoking related 
health care. And, after some years, we’ll 
come back to the same situation, when 
the companies get sued again and the 
cycle of hypocrisy continues.

I am a bisexual. I do not apolo­

Last Friday night, I, along with 
‘ my boyfriend and many friends 
from my floor and around cam­
pus, was dancing the night 
away at a really kickin’ party
hosted by the Delta Tau Delta 
(DTD) fraternity.
I have always enjoyed my time 
at this particular fraternity, and 
in fact, I have considered pledg­
ing there many times. I like the 
music, the atmosphere, and, 
above all, the people whom I have 
met at this fraternity. All-of this 
came to an end last Friday night 
when, during a party that was 
truly one of the best I have seen 
on campus, I was asked, along 
with my boyfriend, to leave the 
fraternity because the two of us 
together might cause a “fight” or 
“situation.” A representative of 
this fraternity approached both 
of us and simply said, “You two 
are leaving now.” If we did not
leave, we were made to believe 
there would be trouble. We were 
then escorted to the back door 
and left the party without being 
allowed to voice our concerns for 
what was happening to us. My 
boyfriend and I were not forcing 
our sexuality upon him, and, since 
we were dancing with a female 
friend between us, we were not 
showing an offensive amount of 
affection towards each other.
I would like to ask the CMU 
community why it is so bad that 
I am deeply in love with another 
man. I will face discrimination 
throughout my life — I under­
stand this fact and accept it as a 
sad commentary on human na-

SHOOTING, from page 6
And while usually the act re­
sulting from this blindness is 
less severe than murder, the 
sum result of each of these small 
internal murders is an Ameri­
can culture that is danger­
ously unwilling to understand, 
and consequently unable to cul­
tivate, an understanding in 
its youth.
The media, along with the 
rest of us, is focusing a power­
ful lens on this event, but blur­
ring it at just the right mo­
ments to soften the edges. We
have to ask ourselves what we 
are afraid of and why we find 
unbearable the proposition that 
this horrible act was com­
mitted by human beings with 
minds and even hearts of 
their own.
If we don’t even try to 
grapple with such questions, 
what are we but the blind lead­

they say I am a sinner and loving

different groups of people have 
been discriminated against dur­
ing different periods of history. 
There were the early Christians, 
the Protestants, the Jews, and 
now, it seems, the homosexuals.
that they remember that one of (I do not mean to state that some 
the most important parts of their of these other groups are not 
religion is the factthat “Thou shalt discriminated against still.) I do

It is God's job to judge 
me for my actions, not 
society’s. Granted all of 
this, I ask, is the love I 
feel for the man sitting 
next to me any different 
from the love others feel 
for their girlfriend or boyfriend?
Being asked to leave the frater­
nity last weekend is the first time 
I have ever been discriminated 
against for my sexuality in my 
life. It is because of this that I am 
distressed. I understand that my 
choice of lifestyle is not welcomed 
by much of America. But at CMU, 
I have found many administra­
tors and students who are under­
standing of who I am, and I truly 
thank them for that. In fact, I

not, nor will I ever apologize for 
who I am as a person: I love my 
boyfriend, and I make no apo­
logies for showing affection 
towards him in public.
The important issue here is 
solely that during a really great 
party at DTD, two guests were 
asked to leave solely on the basis 
of their sexual orientation. That 
is wrong; it is immoral and so­
cially irresponsible. I was not 
asking, and do not ask, for your 
guarantee that, if the members of approval of my lifestyle; I merely
DTD were to meet me as a per­
son, they would not care about 
my sexual orientation. I would 
like to say that they may dis­
like me because I am a mega­
lomaniac, conceited, and just 
plain arrogant — but not because 
I am gay.
Almost anyone who has stud­
ied world history has learned that
ask for tolerance of my lifestyle. 
Which is, at the very least, what 
you can grant me.
The important fact is that we 
are all endowed by our various 
creators with certain character­
istics and attributes, and for me 
one of them happens to be that I 
am bisexual. This is something 
that I cannot change, nor do I
wish to. I merely ask that people 
accept my lifestyle choice and 
understand it. I do not ask that 
they endorse it. In fact, I under­
stand their reservations about 
my choice. But even that does 
not give an individual the 
right to discriminate against an­
other person on the basis of reli-
_____ gion, race, color, creed,
ethnic origin, or sex­
ual orientation.
Please understand 
that people do not choose 
who they are — they do 
not pick some of their 
most vital characteris­
tics. These are factors that, de­
velop either genetically or 
through their upbringing. Given 
this fact, it is inexcusable that 
this society allows discrimina­
tion on any basis to exist. I will 
close with my favorite quote. 
John Foster Dulles, former Sec­
retary of State, once said that: 
“Freedom and duty go hand in 
hand, and if the free do not ac­
cept the duty of social responsi­
bility, they will not long remain 
free.” We as a society must tol­
erate each other if we are to 
move upward for the good of 
humanity. Otherwise, we can 
only falter in our leadership and 
in our society.

Religious faithful find fulfillment
Jeff Thibert
I’m sure that you couldn’t help 
but notice the word “JESUS” em­
blazoned on the Fence this past 
week, along with the friendly 
bunch camped out there, pray­
ing, singing Christian songs, and 
generally causing a lot of people 
to stare at them.
Hopefully, you’ve been able to 
put the pieces together (with the 
help of the 20 million flyers 
around campus) and real­
ize that this sudden interest in 
Jesus is due to this week being 
Jesus Week.
Some people don’t seem en­
tirely comfortable with this week- 
long celebration of the Christian 
Son of God, however. They seem 
to see the Fence people as fanat­
ics who are a little bit too into 
this whole Christian thing. So 
they hurry past, staring, but try­
ing to avoid eye contact, lest they 
be accosted by those crazy Chris­
tians. Then, later on, they talk to 
their friends and laugh at these 
“Jesus freaks.”
Laugh at them all you want — 
I think these people have it down. 
I think we could learn quite a bit 
from them, even if we don’t apply 
it in quite the same manner. Fol­
lowing their example, we could 
probably lead much happier, 
more fulfilling lives.
Of course, I’m not saying that 
we all should become devout 
Christians — although this might 
be perfectly valid for some of us. 
I do claim, however, that some 
sort of religious faith is a great 
help in making it through the 
many tribulations of college life.
Just watching the Jesus Week 
crew, I imagine that almost any-

Planning to Attend Law School
from
U.S.News & World Report
Dear Student:
DON'T YOU JUST HATE TO BE GRADED? Well, by their shrill protests about U.S.News & World Report law school 
rankings, so do most of the deans of the law schools you are considering. However, as a law school graduate with both a 
J.D. and a LL.M. degree, I can tell you that these same deans will subject you to rigorous grading. You will be required 
to endure lectures from tenured professors who have not changed their class notes since the Battle of Hastings. Then, 
after attending class for a full semester, you will be given one exam to determine your grade. One exam, one semester, 
one grade. One roll of the dice to measure your performance.
At U.S.News & World Report we are far more equitable (to use a legal term). We have a multi-faceted, multi­
dimensional, sophisticated ranking system developed and evolved over many years to give you guidance on what 
may be one of your largest financial investments and certainly one of the most important choices for your career in 
law and perhaps beyond. While our law school rankings should not be the only criteria in your choice of a law 
school, they should certainly be an important part of the analysis.
Get your copy of U.S.News & World Report's Best Graduate Schools guide on newsstands now. Or, to make it easier for 
you to see the book that 164 law school deans would prefer you not see (notwithstanding their commitment to the First 
Amendment), call l-800-836'6397 (ask for extension 5105) and I will arrange for a copy of the book to be sent directly 
to you at SI off the newsstand price.* This will also ensure that you have a copy of these important rankings because, as 
a result of publicity surrounding the deans’ determination to have you ignore the rankings, they arc a very hot item.
These law school rankings are a small part of our philosophy of News You Can Use': information we bring you in each 
issue of the magazine to help you manage your life.
Good luck in law school and good luck on making the right choice.
Kindest Regards.

to realize that what really is im­
portant to him is his religion — 
his Jesus — and that will allow 
him to rise above the bad grade 
without sinking too low.
A person without some sort of 
underlying faith might notbe able 
to gain this kind of perspective 
and might elevate the calculus 
test to a far higher position than 
it truly deserves.
For another example, let’s say 
that a Weeker has to face the loss 
of a loved one. He would see this 
person as moving on to greater 
things — ascending to a higher 
plane, in a way. In the Christian 
mind, Heaven (where the Weeker 
would hopefully think his loved 
one was going) is a far better 
place than anywhere on this 
Earth. Heaven is where we are 
liberated from the worldly con­
straints of our bodies and allowed 
to live freely as a human soul.
It’d be hard not to be happy for 
a loved one who was going to such 
a glorious place. The Weeker 
could celebrate the life the per­
son had, the good they did, and 
the joy they must now be experi­
encing with God.
Of course, this isn’t to say that 
the Weekers don’t feel any emo­
tions for very long. It’s not to say 
that doing badly on the calculus 
test wouldn’t affect them at all or 
that they wouldn’t grieve for loved 
ones. I think, however, that their 
far-reaching perspective on 
things could very easily allow 
them to take the seeming­
ly bad situations and see the sil­
ver linings.
So maybe they’d feel badly 
about the calculus test, but their 
faith would allow them to realize 
that failing one test is not the end 
of the world and to see that they 
could definitely take steps to im­
prove their performance on the 
next test. They wouldn’t simply 
mope and not do anything about 
it — same with the grieving for 
the loved one. They would be sad 
for a while, no doubt, but they 
could turn that sadness into joy. 
Plus, it might make them appre­
ciate the people who are still with 
them even more.
I think it’s this ability to turn 
bad things into good that makes 
it so important to have “faith in 
something bigger.” The “some­
thing bigger” doesn’t have to be 
Jesus, and it doesn’t necessarily 
even have to be a God. It could be 
any consistent element of a 
person’s life.
It might be any element that a 
person can use as a boost when 
the waves of life crash against 
him and that can give him per­
spective and allow him to feel 
grief or sadness while always 
maintaining an underlying con­
tentment — a vision that 
everything’s going to be all right. 
So have respect for the Jesus 
Weekers, and draw some inspi­
ration from them. They may not 
be doing it your way, but they’ve 
certainly found one way to go — 
maybe you should look for the 
one that suits you best.
Jeff Thibert is a freshman ma­
joring in Cognitive Science. He 
asks politely for responsible re­
plies to his column from across 
the religious spectrum: Satanists, 
atheists, and devout monotheists 
and polytheists alike. Finally, he’d 
like to thank the Weekers for be­
ing faithful.

Carnegie Mellon sheds some light on campus security
There's no reason to be in the dark about campus security. A team of Carnegie Mellon police officers, security guards, and housing and student life staff members work to keep students, faculty, staff 
and visitors informed and safe on the campus and adjacent areas. These professionals are concerned with the safety and welfare of the campus community and are best able to answer questions 
about campus security.
Crime rates are based on the numbers and categories of crime, divided by the university’s total number of students and 
employees. Figures are per one thousand headcount.

'The number of rapes reported to Campus Police does not reflect the incidents of sexual assault on our campus, a crime that 
is historically underreported. The U.S. Department of Education, in a study published in 1997, reported .8 reports of forcible 
sex offenses per ten thousand enrollment in private 4-year institutions. The Carnegie Mellon Sexual Assault Advisory Group 
continually works to educate and protect the campus community. For the past three years, the sexual assault advisors 
received the following number of inquiries:
1995-3
1996- 10
1997-5
"Both crimes were reported as acquaintance rapes and cleared by Campus Police.
How safe are the neighborhoods surrounding our campus?
In order to better understand the statistics concerning crime, Carnegie Mellon exceeds the federal 
campus, but also in the surrounding neighborhoods.

The men’s team closed a strong 
day with a dominating perfor­
mance in the 5000 meter race. 
The team placed runners 
Kreichbaum, Meyer, and Oldham 
in first, second, and third place.
For the remainder of the 
month the focus of the team will 
be on preparing for the UAA 
championships.
“With the first meet of the sea­

You look to have a solid perfor­

many of us did.” said Donner. 
“With one or two solid races be­

little things to prepare for the 
conference meet in Atlanta at the 
end of the season.”

the addition of Randy Meyers, and sub-

mondbacks) for the booby prize.
I’m running out of space. Here’s the 
rundown of the rest:
AL CENTRAL
1) Indians — Run away champs.
2) White Sox — Default.
3) Tigers — Gettin’ better... Not good, 
but better.
4) Royals — Cool stadium.
5) Twins — Ain’t worth the ink.
AL WEST
1) Mariners — This may be Griffey/ 
Buhner/Martinez’s year.
2) Angels — Barring a second half 
stroke (which is always a possiblity), 
Anaheim should challenge Seattle.
3) Rangers — Despite Wetteland and 
Burkett, pitching will be scary. Not a 
good thing to rely on Pudge and Gonzelez 
in the run-happy West.
4) A’s — Rickey’s back — again. Is that 
a good thing?
There you have it — the world ac­
cording to me. For my pick for the 
World Champion, I refer you to inte­
rior decorator Gus Fredd, who played 
some minor league ball for the Angels 
a decade ago.
“Unless the Yankees come together or 
the Orioles fall apart, the Braves will 
take the Series, and everything will be 
all right,” said Fredd.
To reiterate, Atlanta, Houston, and 
Colorado will win their respecitve divi­
sions and wild card St.Louis will round 
out National League playoff partici­
pants; while Baltimore, Cleveland, 
Seattle, and New York (as the wild 
card) should represent the AL. The 
WorldSeries will come down to a Yan- 
kees-Braves rematch, and the Braves 
will avenge the losses of the previous 
World Championshp meeting to ofFically 
take their place as the dominant team 
of the ’90s.

as simple as developing the right

season. The teams have anticipated the 
outdoor season, in part because they 
have a track at which to practice, unlike 
the indoor season where they have no 
facilities in which to train.
“At CMU the big difference between 
indoor track and outdoor track is that 
we have an outdoor track; we don’t 
have an indoor track. You wouldn’t 
expect a swim team to do well if they 
didn’t have a pool to train in,” said 
junior Kristo Kreichbaum.
The team will only have a month to 
get up to speed for the UAA Champion­
ships in Atlanta. In the time between 
now and then, they will look to im­
prove and earn qualifiers for the Na­
tional Championships.
Seniors Maureen McGranaghan and 
Melissa Lott earned the team’s first pro­
visional qualifiers when they finished 
one and two in the 10,000 meter race.
“I’m very happy with my race. It’s 
the first time I’ve run the 10k, and I 
was a little concerned about maintain­
ing that pace for so long,” said 
McGranaghan. She was also able to 
qualify for the national indoor champi­
onships earlier this. year.
The men’s team was able to place two 
runners high in the standings of the 
10,000 meter event as well. Junior 
Joshua Donner ran 32:15 to place sec­
ond. Senior Brian Ingram ran close be­

“The wind and cold played a big factor.

The Alley Oop
by Chris Cannon
It’s common practice in the 
NBA for bad teams to tank the 
second half of the season to try 
for a better draft position. Some 
organizations, like this year’s 
Denver Nuggets (nine wins, 65 
losses and counting), sacrifice 
the whole season before it starts. 
I say stop beating around the 
bush, if you’re going-to rebuild 
do it right: kill all of your play­
ers. Well not all of your players, 
but at least half the roster.
No, on third thought, kill ev­
erybody but your high school 
star. When he’s away meeting 
with his probation officer, feed 
the rest of them rat poison for 
the pregame meal. A cautious 
general manager would prob­
ably want to arrange a bus or 
plane crash, just to be sure the 
players don’t survive. You think 
I’m kidding, but making a con­
tender out of a cellar-dweller 
can be just this easy. How? Two 
words: disaster draft.
According to the NBA, in case 
of an accident and at least five 
of the team’s roster is left dead 
or dismembered, the league 
will hold an emergency “disas­
ter draft.” Each team can pro­
tect five players and the disas­
ter-stricken team can select 
from the rest. Additionally, 
only one player can be drafted 
off each team.
- In order to avoid offending 
any fans out there take a fic­
tional NBA team, say the Al­
buquerque Ass Triggers, and • 
maim or murder three quar­
ters of the squad: eight play­
ers. It sounds like we’ve just 
cashed in the team for a bunch 
of bench warmers. But all the 
top teams teams have at least 
one player that would start for 
nearly anyone else. Better yet 
the Ass Triggers could nab a 
starter, since GMs would have 
to prepare for the future by 
protecting a young bench 
contributer. What players 
could our fictional club expect 
to grab?
If the Lakers protect Kobe 
Bryant, Albuquerque gets Rick 
Fox or Robert Horry. The Wiz­
ards would be forced to give up 
Tracy Murray, their best 
shooter, or 7’7” giant Gheorge 
Muresan (who hasn’t played a 
game this year anyway). The 
Hawks lose former starter 
Christian Laettner, the Bulls 
are in a similar bind with Luc 
Longley, and we’ll rob the 
Sixers, Suns, and Pacers of 
young guards or key big-men. 
The Nets’ Chris Gatling, per­
haps the league’s best true 
sixth man, completes the Ass 
Trigger bench.
Add this crew to the players 
that didn’t fall to the axe (or what­
ever weapon you used) and this 
represents a rare, solid 12-man 
rotation. But wait — don’t kill 
your players just yet. There are 
added bonuses. This hand-picked 
cast of players isn’t going to per­
form well at first, there’s going to 
be bad chemistry, egos clashing,

The event featured 23 teams from the

very well competing against the bigger

“The meet is rapidly becoming one of

The Strike Zone
by Brian Smith
Sit back, young and old alike, 
and prepare for the 1998 Major 
League Baseball season. Let me, 
your trusted guide and baseball 
aficionado, take you on a voyage 
that will bring you from the birth 
of the Diamondback and Devil 
Ray to the triumph of the usual 
suspects in October. La­
dies and gentlemen, boys 
and girls, you are enter­
ing The Strike Zone.
Do not think that these 
predictions come straight 
from yours truly, how­
ever. I have spent count­
less hours and many 
sleepless nights poring 
over mounds of data so 
that you, the reader, may 
be better-informed about 
the year ahead. This way, 
when Jose Canseco is 
called in to play first base 
and a double play 
grounder knocks him 
senseless, you can say,
“Damn, that Strike Zone 
boy is good!”
My sources ranged from 
the bizarre to the down­
right dumb. Never-mind 
that ESPN’s Peter 
Gammons predicted that 
the Orioles’ relief pitch­
ing would finally come 
around and the team 
would be a legitimate con­
tender when the leaves 
begin to turn — Ian Kwaissar, 
who works in the Baskin Robbins 
in Ross Park Mall, said, “I think 
they will start off strong, then 
fizzle, then pick it up, then fade, 
then surge forward, and finally 
crash.” Ian went on to add, “The 
Royals and the Brewers could 
take it all if the young’uns pro­
duce.” Ian appeared somewhat 
dazed and distracted throughout 
the interview.
Nevertheless, here are the re­
sults of extensive guessing, ridicu­
lous dialogue, and many a night 
around the magic crystal ball. 
NL EAST
1) Braves — Stand back, /all. 
I’m going out on a limb here. There 
is simply no way the Braves can
lose this division — short of Ted 
Turner trading the Starting Rota­
tion of the Millennium for Johnny 
Cash and a player to be named 
later. Despite off-season shuffling 
of the infield and the loss of Kenny 
Lofton, Atlanta should coast into 
the post-season.
2) Expos — Never underesti­
mate the power of Phillipe Alou. 
Montreal has by far the best farm 
system of any small market team 
and has been a thorn in the 
Braves’ side throughout its de­
cade of dominance. While a wild 
card may be as realistic as Bob 
Dole making an appearance on 
Jerry Springer, the Expos may 
turn some heads in 1998.
not that they are bad, but more 
that — well, they’re the Mets. 
Enough said.
5) Phillies — The hopes of the 
Phillies hinge on memories of a 
good second half last season and 
the improbable comeback plans 
of Lenny Dykstra. Hopes and 
dreams don’t win games, though. 
NL CENTRAL
1) Astros — This is the year for 
Bagwell to shine. While this is 
possibly the most competitive di­
vision in baseball, Houston will 
squeak away with the pennant if 
their pitching holds up and the 
team can avoid injuries.
2) Cardinals — Definitely one 
of the best second-place teams
3) Marlins — Yet again — 
manager power. Just as Jim 
Leyland was getting settled into 
an environment that pays mil­
lions for a .230 batting average, 
Wayne Huizenga decided that it 
is better to make money than 
win. He proceeded to trade away 
much of the team’s talent, and 
hence, chances of a World Series 
repeat are none. Leyland still has 
people like Gary Sheffield, Bobby 
Bonilla, and Charles Johnson to 
work with, however, so if pitch­
ing can hold out (why are you 
laughing?), the Marlins may end 
up winning more than they lose.
4) Mets— Continuing on the 
managerial theme, Bobby Val­
entine will be fired by July. It’s
James Mojonnier/Tartan Art Co-Editor
in baseball, Mark McGuire 
should flourish, and St. Louis 
will be a serious contender for a 
wild card bid.
3) Pirates — The team is essen­
tially intact and, with a lot of 
luck, can only improve on last 
year’s relatively strong showing. 
Definitely the best team that a 
little money can buy — after all, 
would you rather have the Pi­
rates or Greg Maddux?
4) Cubs — This will be a very 
close fourth place, but even the 
addition of proven winners like 
JeffBlauser, Mickey Morandini, 
and Rod Beck will not be able to 
pull the Cubs out of the depths 
of mediocrity.
5) Brewers — What do you get
when you take an average-at-best 
team with iffy pitching from the 
American League and put it in 
the National League? Abadteam.
6) Reds — The Big Red Machine 
has been sputtering for a while 
now and will continue to spin its 
wheels near the bottom of the di­
vision for the bulk of the season. 
NL WEST
1) Rockies — The loss of Andres 
Galarraga may hurt, but Colo­
rado got help where they most 
needed it in the form of starting 
pitcher Daryl Kile. They should 
win a tight race in the West.
2) Dodgers — Wonder-hair Bey 
Mike Piazza won’t be able to get 
his team over the hump but will
give the Rockies a run 
for their money and will 
compete with the Cardi­
nals et al for the wild 
card spot.
3) Padres — This is 
where my personal 
preferences and unrea­
sonable hopes set in — 
I like San Diego and I 
dislike the Giants. Go 
Tony go....
4) Giants — It’s not 
like they are really that 
bad, it’s just that some­
one has be take fourth 
place in this close divi­
sion. I’m picking them 
here by default but 
wouldn’t be surprised if 
the Giants steal third 
or even second place in 
the West.
5). Diamondbacks — 
Big Matt Williams is a 
big waste of money. As 
much as I love the guy, 
he just isn’t producing 
nowadays. Save a few 
journeymen, including 
perpetual prospect
Andy Benes, the Diamondbacks 
are a team of no-names and may 
challenge the record for the most 
losses in a season.
ALEAST
1) Orioles — Some may argue 
the Yankees are hands down the 
best team in the East. However, 
you must plan for some injuries 
(David Cone) and the New York 
factor (see also: New York Rang­
ers). Baltimore has an extremely 
solid roster, with the only ques­
tion mark being the Bullpen.
2) Yankees — It should be a 
good race, but for reasons delin­
eated above, New York should be 
concentrating on the wild card. If 
the Yankees do make it to the

to Carver, 
the school is 
not like an aver­
age preschool or kin­
dergarten, since a lot of 
emphasis is placed on stu­
dents working independently, . 
incorporating art into the lessons, 
and developing strong cognitive skills.
“I remember playing all the time and 
taking naps [in preschool]. These kids 
are making big projects about dinosaurs 
and foreign cultures,” said Mutchler, 
who recently helped the children com­
plete their written descriptions of the 
dinosaur dioramas they created. “They 
are just learning to explore the world 
around them. Their imaginations are 
amazing,” he said.
Several CMU students work with the 
children at the school in different ca­
pacities, as interns, researchers, volun­
teers, or work-study students. Gener­
ally, these students spend their time at 
the school assisting the teachers with 
the day’s activities, whether they are 
supervising and playing with the kids
on the 
playground,
helping them use the school’s comput­
ers, or reading them stories and teach­
ing them songs.
“I have developed an informal rela­
tionship with [the kids], as opposed to a 
student-teacher relationship,” said 
Mutchler, who, like many other stu­
dents who work there, described the 
strong bonds he has built with the chil­
dren by working with them and becom­
ing their friend.

school also offers an extended evening 
program for six students. The program

Psychological research has 
shown that low self-esteem is a 
common problem for girls aged 
9 through 15. While the reasons 
for this period of low self-image 
vary, the Take Our Daughters 
To Work (TODTW) program is a 
way for these girls to explore 
different careers which in turn 
helps them to discover what 
makes their own personalities 
unique and wonderful. Carnegie 
Mellon will hold its sixth an­
nual Take Our Daughters to 
Work Day on Thursday, April 
23. Organizers hope to expose 
local young women to the differ­
ent fields and occupations that 
exist in an academic commu­
nity such as CMU.
“[T.QDTW] raises conscious­
ness that there is something 
that happens to girls between 9 
and 15 and that it is an impor­
tant issue,” said Brenda Gra­
ham, principal software engi­
neer for Academic Computing 
and Information Systems and 
one of the first organizers of the 
event. “There are some girls who 
are confident at 9 years old but 
end up hating themselves when 
they’re 13.... [TODTW] gives 
these girls positive messages 
and assures them that they’re 
bright enough, cute enough,
and all-around swell enough 
to succeed.”
The Ms. Foundation for 
Women started TODTW in 1993; 
CMU’s recognition of the day 
started then as well, although 
then it was organized through 
the Career Center.
“[The first year], Karen 
Litzinger (of the Career Center) 
held a luncheon for those who 
brought their daughters to work 
with them,” said Graham. “But. 
the Career Center really didn’t 
have the budget or the manpower 
to make it happen.”
So in 1994, individual depart­
ments and schools such as Com­
puter Science began hosting 
events for daughters, but there 
was no University-wide pro­
gram, according to Garrett 
Pelton, senior research pro­
grammer in the Robotics Insti­
tute and TODTW coordinator.
Starting in 1995, however, the 
event began to grow because of 
funding from the office of the 
President and an increased vol­
unteer base. This year’s program 
includes eight different tracks 
(groups of presentations) that 
the girls can attend to get infor­
mation about different career 
fields. It also includes a lun­
cheon with keynote speaker 
Maggie Forbes, director of the 
Pittsburgh Children’s Museum, 
as well as a. morning of
watching parents or guard­
ians during their everyday 
work routines.
“This is the first year that 
we’ve actually had a totally 
female group of presenters, 
which is wonderful because it 
provides so many role models 
for the girls,” said Jill Diskin, 
this year’s TODTW Day orga­
nizer and manager of the Em­
ployment and Employee Re­
lations department in Human 
Resources. “We’re expecting 
as many if not more [girls] 
than last year. We’ve planned 
an extra track this year be­
cause last year some of them 
were overbooked.”
TODTW Day at CMU-has 
been met with questions, ac­
cording to Graham. She has 
noticed that some people who 
are skeptical about funding 
such an event, since the pro­
gram doesn’t include boys. 
But, she said, when people 
realize TODTW Day is a to­
tally voluntary program and 
not a campus-wide career day, 
they understand the reasons 
for funding.
“If volunteers would set up 
another day strictly for boys, it 
would happen too. IJd be all for 
that,” said Graham.
According to her, the 
President’s office only funds

You’ve probably griped to a 
friend recently about your heavy 
courseload, or maybe that you’re 
bored with what Pittsburgh has 
to offer. Then maybe you flipped 
on a TV or opened a newspaper 
and read about a conflict halfway 
across the world and thought, 
“Wow, those people could use a 
break a lot more than me.”
A group called the Irish Po­
litical Prisoners Children’s Holi­
day (IPPCH) does just that — 
gives a break to children in a 
difficult situation by bringing 
them to Pittsburgh for a month 
and exposing them to new cul­
tural surroundings.
Each child is brought over at the 
cost of IPPCH and. stays with a 
host family, doing activities with 
the rest of the children here on 
holiday throughout the month they 
stay. In addition to Pittsburgh, the 
program operates in regions in­
cluding Massachusetts, New 
Jersey, and New York.
Margaret Brindle, pro­
fessor of business ad- gr 
ministration, and 
her family became 
involved in the program • ' 
through her son. Having 
studied Gaelic for several years 
and gained interest in the prob­
lems in Northern Ireland, he
brought the program to her atten­
tion. She and her family hosted a
10-year-old girl named Shawna 
for a month last summer.
The point of the program, said 
Brindle, is to get the kids out of 
the sometimes warlike atmo­
sphere in Northern Ireland, 
where Land Rovers patrol the 
streets and policemen stand in 
the schools. The children brought 
here on holiday are those of po­
litical prisoners, or those who 
have parents who have been killed 
in the conflict, because they are 
often stigmatized by their peers 
and may have had their houses 
raided by soldiers.
“It gives me perspective on life; 
it’s so easy to get wrapped up in 
our own lives,” she said. “They’re 
really fun kids ... very active and 
... full of joy.”
Such à holiday serves a dual 
purpose, however. Besides
getting out of a difficult situation 
for a month in the summer, the 
kids are exposed to a different 
culture and have opportunities 
to do and see different things 
than they are used to. Shawna 
was involved in many of the same 
activities as Brindle’s children.
In fact, Brindle said, one of the 
real advantages of the program 
to the host family is that the 
cultural exchange is on both sides. 
Her kids, who range from ages 10 
to 18, got to hear about a com­
pletely different lifestyle. Shawna 
danced almost constantly and 
also taught them some Gaelic.
Having a child in the house 
who was afraid of police because 
they raided her house made her 
family really aware of the tur-

They were engaged. Then one day, by 
the Legos, everyone heard the horrible 
news: They were going to break up. 
Later that day on the playground, one 
friend pleaded, “But you can’t break up, 
you’ve been together so long. You’re sup­
posed to get married.”
Incidents like this have reminded jun­
ior Matt Mutchler, a psychology major 
and intern at the Children’s School, about 
the amazing social interactions, rela­
tionships, and imaginations of the 
preschoolers he works with each week.
The Children’s School, located in Mar­
garet Morrison, holds preschool and kin­
dergarten classes. The school exists as a 
laboratory for the Carnegie Mellon psy­
chology department — its primary mis­
sion is to assist faculty research, al­
though much of the research is con­
ducted by undergraduates who develop 
their research methods and techniques.
“The Children’s School is helping to 
train those who lead the future, both the 
young children who go there and those 
students who work there,” said Dr. 
Sharon Carver, director of the Children’s 
School and adjunct associate professor 
of psychology.

Even though he is only 28, Patrick 
Combs has already achieved a level of 
success that most people do not reach 
until later in their career. But Combs is 
not a genius and does not have any. 
superpowers. To most people, he looks 
like an ordinary human, just like any 
one of the CMU students who came to 
Rangos Hall last Monday to listen to 
him. His message was that it does not 
take genius to be successful, only intern­
ships, persistence, and his book.
Combs’s visit was part of a national 
tour of college campuses sponsored by 
Visa. His talk, “Major in Success,” ex­
plained how to make college easier, 
beat the system, and get a very cool 
job. Many of the principles he spoke 
about are from his book of the same 
name, which was handed out free to 
the students in attendance.
One of Combs’s main points was that 
going to a good college and getting good 
grades are not enough. He did not realize 
this until his sophomore year at San 
Francisco State University, when 
Deborah Lowe, the professor to whom his 
book is dedicated, taught him a very 
important lesson about what is really 
important in preparing for a good career.
“What [Lowel said changed my entire 
life,” said Combs. “She told me, ‘Patrick, 
the most important work you do in col­
lege is never assigned.’ ”
His presentation reflected Lowe’s 
ideas. He only used the word “career,” 
not job, to refer to what college students 
are working toward, because, he said, 
“job” stands for “Just Over Broke.”
“You don’t want to work all this time to 
be ‘Just Over Broke’; you want to work 
hard so you can get a career in some­
thing you truly enjoy,” said Combs.
While there are many ways to improve 
your chances of having a great career 
after graduation, Combs strongly be­
lieves that the three most important are 
internships, leadership in campus clubs, 
and computer skills. Using these three 
fundamentals alone, he narrowed a field 
of potential interview candidates for a 
ficticious job — the entire audience — 
down to only 18 students.
Internships were the most important 
aspect and the greatest limiting factor 
in evaluating the field. “Don’t even think 
of graduating without an internship,” 
said Combs. “Three internships sets 
yourselfupforagoodjob.... With four or 
five internships, you start to get the 
jobs that make you look like you’re 
walking on water.”
He recommended several places to 
look for internships. He explained that 
the Career Center and department 
heads can lead an interested student in 
the right direction.
Combs also introduced another method 
of getting an internship: the informa­
tional interview. In this type of inter­
view, interested students simply call or 
visit a professional working in the field in 
which they’re interested. In many cases, 
he said, these interviews have resulted in 
the student landing an internship, or 
even a full-time career, simply because 
they showed initiative and enthusiasm.
“Nothing is harder to do than an infor­
mational, interview, but nothing is bet­
ter,” said Combs.
He also encouraged everyone to get a 
leadership role in a campus club, pointing 
out that such a role has benefits beyond 
the obvious ones of responsibility and lead­
ership. “Surround yourself with positive 
people,” he said. “You’ll hear all of their 
stories, and they will motivate you.” 
Finally, he discussed the importance 
of computer skills in the workplace; typi­
cally, he said, people who possess them 
earn 15 percent more.
After his talk, Combs stayed to sign 
his book. About 30 students remained in 
Rangos to ask him personal questions. 
Many of them found him eager to help.
“[It wasn’t] an infomercial. [He came] 
out as someone who’s actually done 
these things,” said Louis Cohen, a 
sophomore industrial management 
major. “The real-world presentation 
makes a lot of difference.”
The Career Center will be showing 
the video of Combs’s presentation 
throughout the month of April. Attend­
ing students will receive a free copy of 
Major in Success while they last. Inter­
ested students can email Ron 
Delfine in the Career Center at

Showing his true colors.
Professor climbs mountains, plays organs
By KEVIN BABBITT
Tartan Features Editor
Physics professor Hugh Young is one 
of the few faculty members with a di­
ploma hanging on the wall of his office: 
only people in the medical professions do 
that, he says. What one might not expect, 
however, is that the diploma is a 
bachelor’s degree in music, not in phys­
ics. He plays the organ and has recently 
returned from a recital tour in Spain, 
where he had the opportunity to play 
instruments that were hundreds of years 
old in Spanish cathedrals.
Young came to CMU as a freshman in 
1948 and has been here ever since, as an 
undergraduate, a graduate student, and 
a faculty member. He is also an avid fan 
of mountain climbing, and he will be 
using climbing as a metaphor for life 
when he delivers his installment in the 
Last Lecture series this Wednesday.
The Tartan: So what will your Last 
Lecture be about?
Hugh Young: The premise of the Last 
Lecture series is to answer the question, 
“What would a faculty member say to 
his students if it was his last chance?” 
The topic of the lecture is not necessarily 
in his field of expertise, but rather is 
about life in general.
I’ve done a certain amount of moun­
taineering, and when talking about 
mountaineering, the question of why 
people do it immediately arises. For me, 
the answer is to set challenges for 
yourself and then test yourself to see if 
you can meet those challenges — 
doingyour best to meet whatever chal­
lenge you set.
On any major mountain, you’re really 
sticking your neck out; bad weather and 
accidents happen. It’s a big risk.
Brian smitn/1 artan sports uo-baitor 
Hugh Young compares the challenges of life to those associated with mountaineering.
TT: Why do you do it? What do you get 
out of climbing?
HY: It’s a physical challenge; I like to 
prove to myself I can do it. And, of course, 
the view from the top is spectacular.
Climbing is also a team effort; when 
you’re climbing on a steep face, your 
team climbs one person at a time, pro­
tecting each other on the way up. If you 
don’t do your job, then the person that 
you’re protecting might die, and so 
interdependence is crucial. It builds a 
kind of bond among members of a team 
and is a very satisfying and enriching 
kind of thing.
TT: Let’s talk a little about your re­
cital tour in Spain. How did you get 
started playing the organ?
HY: My mother was a piano teacher, so 
I started piano at a very early age. I began 
playing organ in high school, and thought 
about going into music professionally, but 
decided — in hindsight, correctly — that I 
had better do something else.
After being on the faculty here for about 
15 years, I went back to school and got my 
Bachelor’s degree in organ, exactly 20 
years after I had received my bachelor’s 
degree in physics. I played in several recit­
als and was also the assistant organist at 
St. Paul’s Cathedral for four years.
TT: How did you get on the tour?
HY: I knew someone at the University of 
Michigan: Marilyn Mason, who’s the head 
of the organ department and is also known 
internationally as a professor of organ.
She organizes tours in Europe with recit­
als, and this year the trip was to Spain.
We visited Malaga, Cordoba, Sevilla, 
Toledo, and Segovia and had recitals in 
cathedrals in Malaga, Cordoba, and 
Segovia. These instruments were built 
between 1700 and 1750 and are very 
different from those made today. The 
repertoire that can be played on these 
instruments is very limited, but some 
music sounds much better.
They have very colorful sounds — loud 
trumpet stops — fiery, not very subtle, 
but fun to play. You sort of have the 
feeling like you’re driving a Ferrari.
But the trip wasn’t all organ music; we 
did some sightseeing as well. I like Spain 
a lot, and it was avery enjoyable trip. A lot 
of the people who played were profes­
sional organists, and so I could sort of 
pretend I was a professional organist, too.
TT: How else have you applied the 
principle of doing the best you can, no 
matter what it is, to your life?
HY: When I was an undergraduate, I 
wasn’t content to just pass courses; I 
wanted the best grades I could possibly 
get. If a professor complimented me on a 
term paper, I lit up like a Christmas tree.
I’ve integrated this philosophy into 
my writing as well; I’ve written several 
introductory-level college textbooks, and 
have always striven to write something 
really well-done, not just something easy 
to do or something that will sell well.
It has also applied to the “Mr. Fix-It” 
projects I do around the house. I feel I 
do a better job at some of these things 
than some professionals. Of course, it 
takes me four times as long, but the end 
result is worth it!
It was something my mother really 
emphasized when I was young: Don’t do 
anything half-assed; it’s not worth it. No 
matter what it is, do it as well as you can.

last Wednesday as part of Lambda Sigma’s “Kilt for Cancer” fundraiser.

Show combines fashion with dance numbers
By EMILY LANDES
Tartan Staffwriter
The program for Enigma, the annual 
Spirit fashion show, promised “a night 
of excitement and high fashion right 
here in the Rangos Ballroom.” Many 
students, both current and prospective, 
felt that Spirit not only achieved, but 
actually exceeded the promises they 
made last Saturday.
“I loved the show. It was a lot better 
than I expected,” said audience member 
Reza Sadeghi, a sophomore industrial 
management major. “The music gave 
the show a lot of energy. It made me 
want to groove.”
A combination of many different mu­
sical styles was used to produce the 
show. The casual and business portions 
featured rap music, R&B singers crooned 
as intimate nightwear and formalwear 
was modeled, and more electronically- 
influenced beats accompanied the 
clubwear and leather sections. At first 
glance, the use of music to provoke a 
certain mood can be attributed to Geoff 
Jarrett, who was the DJ for the show. 
However, Jarrett, a freshman architec­
ture major, is quick to place credit else­
where. “The models picked out the songs; 
I just put it together,” he said.
Music also played an important role 
in the three dance numbers inter­
spersed throughout the show. These 
acts were first added to give the mod­
els a chance to change between scenes, 
but Maurice Parent, a freshman busi­
ness administration major and chore­
ographer of the first dance, “Phenom­
enon,” saw the performances as more 
than just a stallingtechnique. “It made 
Enigma more than just a fashion show 
but a true event,” he said.
Humor also helped to flesh out the 
show. From rip-off pants in the intimate 
nightwear section to the Afro wig worn 
by one clubwear model and the fake 
fangs worn by the female leather mod­
els, a sense of fun was a constant through­
out the show.
“Humor was. a necessity to keep the 
audience’s attention and to show we 
aren’t professional, that this is a real- 
life type of show,” said Nicole Ayala, a 
sophomore information and decision 
systems major and member of Spirit’s 
Special Events Committee.
The models weren’t the only ones who 
added an air of levity to Enigma. Many

students felt that Master of Ceremonies 
Diondre Johnson, a sophomore civil and 
environmental engineering major, was 
an essential component to keeping the 
show light and entertaining. During the
show, Johnson engaged the crowd in a 
chorus of “If You’re Ugly and You Know 
It,” gave his rendition ofMichael Jackson’s 
“Man in the Mirror,” and questioned the 
numerous “shout-outs” to Ohio.
While most of the audience seemed to 
enjoy the show, Enigma was especially 
targeted at prospective minority students 
who were attending as part of their Sleep- 
ingBag Weekend. Many of the baggers at 
the show appeared concerned about a 
lack of minority students at CMU.
Ayala said that Enigma was produced 
in an attempt to address such concerns. 
“The priority in organizing the show is the 
baggers,” she said. <cWe’re trying to show 
them that CMU is a top academic school, 
but it can also provide an atmosphere for 
learning, socializing, and growing.”
Mavis Burks, a prospective student 
from Erie, Pennsylvania, said that he 
would like to join Spirit. “[They] pre­
sented such a positive image of them­
selves,” he said. Justin Flowers, a pro­
spective student from Voorhees, N.J., 
also said that he would most likely be­
come involved in the organization.
These testimonials are the best com­
pliments that Enigma chair and coordi­
nator Cindy Henry could have hoped for. 
“Spirit is redefining its role by trying to 
look past cultural differences to bring 
the community together,” the sophomore 
chemistry major said. “I think there is a 
new Spirit, and it’s alive and kicking.”Student assistants form bonds with young people

Kelly Sheridan, a sophomore psychol­
ogy major and volunteer at the school, 
has been working on cooking and the 
alphabet with the children in the pro­
gram. They have been working through
the alphabet, each time making some­
thing that starts with the next letter. “I 
was amazed by what they could do in the 
kitchen,” she said. “They improved so 
much going from A to Z.”
Keeping the program small has also 
made it more successful for the students 
and the children. “I’ve gotten to know 
each individual child, and each indi­
vidual child has gotten to know me,” 
said Sheridan.
According to Carver, there are many 
advantages to having CMU students 
work with the children. “Students bring 
a diversity of talents and interests to 
the school that the teachers may not 
have to offer,” she said. Some students 
speak foreign languages which they
can teach the children, while others 
bring talents in music and drama to 
the children.
“The classrooms offer direct experi­
ence for the students toward their pro­
fessions,” said Carver. “This is one of 
Carnegie Mellon’s strengths — provid­
ing practical experiences for students, 
putting the theory into practice.”
According to Carver, about half of the 
students who help are psychology ma­
jors, but the other half come from varied 
disciplines, gaining experience working 
with children in other capacities: as pe­
diatricians, therapists, and lawyers, and 
as parents, aunts, or uncles. “We are 
training them to be responsible adults in 
a society that values children,” she said.

Alumni Association honors four seniors for service
By SHEILA FLANAGAN
Tartan Staffwriter
The summer before your freshman 
year at Carnegie Mellon, you probably 
received a copy of The Word and found 
yourself amazed by the number of extra­
curricular activities CMTJ has to offer. 
You probably paged through the book 
excitedly, checking off the clubs you 
hoped to join once you arrived on cam­
pus, only to be faced with a harsh reality 
when you began your first semester of 
classes: regular involvement in extra­
curricular activities is no easy feat when 
combined with the amount of academic 
work at CMU. However, students like 
Gregory Acton, Jennifer Gray, Brenadine 
Humphrey, and Christina Lopez, who 
will be receiving the Student Service 
Award on May 14, proved that they 
weren’t phased by this reality during 
their four years at CMU.
Instead, these students became lead­
ers in various activities while still achiev­
ing above average grades.
Lopez, a senior psychology major who 
describes her service work as something 
she needs to do to survive, chose to 
dedicate a great deal of her time to roles
such as head orientation counselor, 
sexual assault advisor, and selection 
chair for Mortar Board.
“I have learned a great deal in my 
classes, but it has been my extracurricu­
lar activities and the people I have met 
through doing them that have taught 
me the most important life lessons,” said 
Lopez. “My college experience would 
have been totally different had I focused 
solely on academics.”
The Student Service Award was es­
tablished in February 1992 by the 
Alumni Association Executive Board 
(AAEB) and the Student Alumni Rela­
tions Council (SARC). The award is 
designed to strengthen the ties be­
tween the student body and Alumni 
Association and to recognize seniors 
who have provided outstanding ser­
vice to CMU and the surrounding com­
munity while maintaining a high level 
of academic achievement.
According to Rebecca Florey, assis­
tant director of Alumni Relations, this 
year’s recipients were selected from a 
pool of 17 nominees representing 16 
departments and all of the colleges within 
CMU. The students were nominated by 
their peers in the junior and senior
classes, faculty, staff, and alumni. These 
nominations involved a listing of the 
nominees’ community service and ex­
tracurricular activities, along with op­
tional supporting letters describing the 
nominees’ service in more detail.
same goal: to improve the community 
around her.
“There’s nothing I enjoy more than 
seeing someone smile and knowing that 
I had some part in creating that smile,” 
she said.
“I think the most rewarding thing about ser­
vice work... is to have someone come up to 
you and say that you’ve made a difference in 
their life.”
— Christina Lopez, senior psychology major
“[Those who were selected] had an 
amazing amount of community ser­
vice.... they were clearly dedicated to 
serving their peers and groups in the 
area,” said Florey.
Gray, a senior English major, has held 
various roles in Alpha Phi Omega, in­
cluding president. She is currently the 
chair of Student Senate, assistant secu­
rity chair for the Spring Carnival Com­
mittee, and treasurer of KGB. She ap­
proaches her leadership roles with the
The recipients of the Student Ser­
vice Award were chosen by a commit­
tee consisting of members of the AAEB 
and SARC. The members of this com­
mittee used a rating scale to evaluate 
the nominees’ grades, community ser­
vice, and extracurricular activities. 
Those with the top four scores at the 
end of this process were selected to 
receive the award.
Acton, Gray, Humphrey, and Lopez 
will be recognized at a brunch on May
14, where each student will receive a 
plaque signed by the President of the 
Alumni Association. The plaques will be 
presented by the president of SARC and 
the assistant vice-president and direc­
tor of alumni relations. Jared Cohon, 
president of CMU, will serve as the key­
note speaker at this brunch, which will 
also feature the presentation of the Se­
nior Leadership Award to about 60 
graduating seniors.
For some recipients, their dedica­
tion to community service will not end 
after they graduate from CMU. Gray 
will remain involved in scouting and 
hopes to work in soup kitchens or with 
food and clothing drives. Lopez has 
been taking sign language classes at 
the University of Pittsburgh and hopes 
to work with members of the deaf com­
munity in the future.
“I think the most rewarding thing 
about service work is seeing just one 
person who has benefited from your 
work.... the best feeling is to have some­
one come up to you and say that you’ve 
made a difference in their life,” said 
Lopez. “I’m addicted to that feeling [and] 
that’s why I think I’ll be doing service 
work for the rest of my life.”

Why is it that superheroes always seem so com­
fortable in those crazy costumes they wear? I 
don’t know about you, but I don’t relish the idea of 
having to wear full-body spandex. Plus, with a super­
hero’s active lifesytle, your generic crimefighting cos­
tume is going to take a lot of damage on the job. I 
wonder if Superman ever had to take a time-out to fix 
a tear in his tights. Hey, it could happen.

You mg?Ca
“One thing I really would like to see is that you show where you are on each waitlist on the main 
course registration listing for you. There’s no real way to find out.”
lH C?Ca
Now OLR will tell you that you are in “x” position out of “n” on the waitlist 
(i.e., 9 of 15).
You mg?Ca
“I think you should take all the pretty graphics off, because when 1,200 people are hitting one Web 
page at once, they’re not really going to appreciate all the pretty pictures.”
lH C?Ca
To speed things up during registration week, OLR will use the text-only version. The graphics 
version will return, with a choice to select the text-only version, after the initial registration week.
You mg?Ca
“I would like to check the enrollment status of certain courses before it is my day, as a sophomore, 
to register.”
lH C?Ca
Great idea! Now you can access Course Information On-Line at http://www.cmu.edu/hub/—a new 
feature coming to the HUB Web site. You can determine if you have the prereqs to get into a 
course, view by department all courses and their prereqs, view the current status of a course, by 
section, with displays for expected class size and up-to-date meeting times, building, room and 
instructor. It will not display wait list information nor whether there is a seat for you in the class.
You mg?Ca
“I really wish that the system told me which prerequisites I was missing instead of simply saying ‘you 
don’t have everything you need.’”
lH C?Ca
The new Course Information On-Line featured on the HUB Web site provides a listing of prereqs. 
You can even use a “what-if” prereq checker to determine if you meet the specific prereqs for 
a course.
You mg?Ca
“Overall it was pretty easy, however this damn prereq thing is driving me nuts. I need to register for 
a section to complete my major. The system tells me I have to have another course, but my professor 
waived this course for me when I registered for another course earlier on.”
lH C?Ca
Now academic departments will be adding prerequisite waivers to the system, so OLR will know if 
a student has had a prerequisite waived. In addition OLR will not require graduate students to be 
checked for prereqs, since most grads have done their undergrad course work elsewhere.
You mg?Ca
“When I have a full schedule, how can I add a course without first dropping a course to 
make room?”
lH C?Ca
Now during the add/drop period (after the assigned registration days), you’ll be able to try adding 
a course, without having to drop a course to make room for the add. Like section switching, course 
switch will retain the seat in the “dropped” course until the “add” course has been successful.
for fall registration April 20-24 
See next week’s Tartan for your fall OLR user’s guide.
YOU LIVED THROUGH IT...
Despite our best-laid plans 
last semester, there was an 
unforeseen system outage 
that occurred between Day 
Two and Day Three. The 
result: OLR worked as 
planned for seniors and 
juniors, but sophomores and 
freshmen suffered through 
two days of hell.
iekHj Uk?62m 1-8 7g?Ca
...BEFORE THE OUTAGE...
“The performance is great. This is the fastest and easiest registration cycle 
I ever went through.”
— a senior
“This thing KICKS SOO MUCH ASSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!. well deserved
applause for whomever designed, created and implemented this OLR.
It absolutely rules.”
— a senior
“On-line registration is so COOL! I’m currently taking a leave-of-absence 
from CMU for fall-97 semester to work as an intern ... in San Jose,
Calif. On-line registration allows me to register classes for spring-98 
semester from the West Coast.”
— a senior
“On-line registration is a great idea. I had been waiting in lines for the 
past four years. Now, I’m registering for classes from my home in 
Squirrel Hill. No, I had no problems.”
— a senior
“It is a really good thing. Sure beats waltzing around campus and 
standing in lines.”
— a junior
“OLR is excellent, I had no problems registering!”
— a grad student
...AFTER THE OUTAGE...
“Overall I think it is a good system but there are definite problems.
The response time was agonizingly slow all of 11/19.”
— a sophomore
“The ‘Ferrari of registration systems,’ my ass.”
— a sophomore
“Performance on OLR was better than I had expected, given the problems 
encountered last week. 1 logged on at about 7:45 this morning and it took me 
approximately 2 hours to register. Many people began at 6 a.m. and are still 
working almost 5 hours later. Everyone I know has skipped classes today to 
register — somewhat ironic, no? I think that within the next few semesters, 
OLR will become the easiest and most efficient means of registration.”
— a freshman
“The system worked slow, but it seems to be a good system. Next 
year if some of the glitches are fixed it should be a good way 
of registering.”
— a freshman

Organic diets supplement nutritious lifestyles, ethical beliefs on campus
By BECCA FRIBUSH
Tartan Forum Editor
Upon finding themselves in a 
24-hour restaurant south of the 
Mason-Dixon line, most people 
would, succumb to their baser in-
in West Virginia, yet at CMU 
and in Pittsburgh, vegans like 
Wang, and others who follow 
health-conscious diets, make up 
a small, but significant part of 
the community.
On campus, CMU Vegetarians 
stincts and order a plateful of has meetings featuring potluck
fried chicken. Or perhaps a slice 
.of freshly baked pie topped with 
ice cream. Not Andrew Wang.
The senior computer science 
jmaj or and active member of CMU 
Vegetarians was at a Shone/s 
restaurant in West Virginia once.
meals every two months and 
runs two or three other activi­
ties a semester.
Vegetarians don’t eat any 
meat. Vegans go farther and also 
cut all other animal products,
was drawn to the health ben­
efits of eating in such a struc­
tured and nutritious way.
“My dad started [following a 
similar dietl because he had can­
cer,” she said. “He said it made 
him feel really good and healthy. 
I asked if he would let me go [to 
a doctor who specializes in de­
signing such eating plans] too, 
so I did.”
Vegetarians and vegans also 
stress health as one benefit of 
doing without animal products.
“Vegetarianism is about health — the 
health of your body or, if you will, the 
health of your soul
— Dan Denlinger 
East End Co-op
;“I ordered some peas, which were 
the only thing on the menu that 
were vegan — I thought,” he said. 
“And when it came, it had bits of 
meat ground up in it. I said ‘I’m a 
vegan. Ijust want something veg­
etarian.’ And [the waitress] kind 
of stared at me in disbelief, say­
ing, "We don’t get many of your 
kind around here.’ ”
That may be the case over there
such as milk and eggs, out of “[Since becoming a vegan, I’m]
better, faster, stronger, able 
to do more things,” said Mark 
Dambacher, who works as 
staff for the School of Com­
puter Science.
“It has made me less sus­
ceptible to sinus infections, 
bacterial infections, [and] 
colds,” saidDambacher’s wife 
Naomi, who is also staff in 
Computer Science. Both 
Dambachers are involved in 
CMU Vegetarians.
But, for many who make the 
decision to start and maintain 
vegetable-based diets, a strong 
moral component is also at work. 
By not eating meat, they’re choos­
ing not to take part in the killing 
of animals for food. The belief 
that eating eggs, dairy products, 
and other foods derived from ani­
mals equals exploitation of ani­
mals, and is therefore ethically
their diets. Then there are those 
like sophomore mechanical en­
gineering major Rebecca 
Bauman, who haven’t entirely 
given up animal products, but 
share the vegetarian’s focus on 
eating healthfully and natu­
rally. Bauman follows a spe­
cially-designed diet which fo­
cuses on avoiding processed or 
chemically altered foods. She
wrong, drives many of those who 
become vegans. “I wanted to be 
made of serene, peaceful plants 
rather than killed animals,” said 
freshman electrical and computer 
engineering major Evin 
Robertson, another member of 
CMU Vegetarians, on why he 
adopted a vegan diet.
For some vegetarians, concerns 
about physical well-being and 
moral justice are intertwined. 
‘Vegetarianism is about health 
— the health of your body or, if 
you will, the health of your soul,” 
said Dan Denlinger, the perish­
able/frozen/supplement buyer for 
the East End Co-op in Point 
Breeze, which stocks foods that 
are friendly to vegetarians and 
other health-conscious eaters.
Many members of the CMU 
community who follow such diets 
shop at East End, which carries 
such vegetarian and vegan 
staples as organic produce, non­
dairy beverages, and whole grain 
foods, as well as some free-range 
and organic meats.
Still, the right kinds of foods 
aren’t always as accessible as 
they could be. “It’s sometimes 
hard to find food that’s good 
within my vegan restrictions,” 
said Mark Dambacher.
“Since I’m on campus, I can’t 
find places that’ll serve stuff I 
can eat. Sometimes that’s a real 
pain in the butt,” said Bauman.
All art this page Mark Adato/Tartan Art Co-Editor
Cooking meals oneself is one 
way to get around this problem. 
“When you prepare your own food, 
you get what you want,” said 
sophomore psychology major and 
vegetarian Lisa Bigelow. “Or at 
least what you’ve got time for.”
And cooking without some of 
the less healthy foods out there 
can yield some unexpected ad­
vantages. According to Naomi 
Dambacher, “It takes... less time 
to wash the dishes, as they are 
not greasy.”

CMU stops to smell 
the aromatherapy
By ELLEN BELDNER
Tartan News Editor
Chances are, the steel ’n’ industry town of Pittsburgh isn’t 
the first thing that pops up when you think of yoga, Feng Shui, 
acupuncture, or aromatherapy. But as non-traditional wellness 
practices grow in popularity across the United States, it is 
inevitable that they spread to Pittsburgh and to members of the 
CMU community.
At last week’s Pittsburgh Health Expo, held at the D. L. Lawrence 
Convention Center, scores of local alternative health practitioners touted 
everything from tarot decks to full-spectrum phototherapy lamps in an 
attempt to increase public knowledge of alternative health techniques 
and practices.
Alternative health practices aren’t restricted to fringe practitio­
ners who eat organic food and walk around with crystals 
clicking in their pockets, however. For example, many 
Carnegie Mellon students and faculty pratcice non- 
Westem forms of exercise, such as aikido — a martial 
art that emphasizes the development of harmony 
and spiritual peace — and yoga, the Hindi medi­
tation that both helps Hindi practitioners to­
wards enlightenment and gives non-Hindus a 
means of relaxation, stretching, and meditation.
More informally, CMU students frequently 
give each other back rubs and neck rubs as 
they study and listen to lectures. Massage 
can relieve the pain of tension headaches — 
the most common type of headache, caused 
by a tightening of the neck muscles which 
ithen pull on the facial muscles around the 
hairline. Proponents of massage also 
maintain that the discipline stimulates 
circulation and helps to eliminate toxins 
from the lymph system.
And practically everyone at CMU has 
been touched by the “winter blues” at 
some point during Pennsylvania’s long, 
gray winters. Seasonal Affective Disorder 
,(SAD), a mild depressive condition caused 
by decreased light during the winter months 
that affects almost 20 percent of the popu­
lation can cause irritability, decreased con­
centration, weight gain, a reduction in sex 
drives, and. decreased creativity. Doctors 
and therapists are now suggesting that treat­
ment with full-spectrum lights can alleviate 
the negative effects of light deprivation and 
.prevent SAD.
Apart from the non-traditional physical rem­
edies and activities that are available to CMU stu­
dents, spirituality and mood-enhancing remedies 
abound in many different forms, such as aromatherapy 
— the use of essential oils to improve mood — tarot readings, 
and Feng Shui, a Chinese philosophy that is used to promote 
environmental harmony and balance.
So grab those crystals and burn some incense — alternative health 
has arrived and it’s grabbing its place in Western treatment practices.
health
By ELIZABETH CURRID
Tartan Staffwriter
Recent trends in alternative health can involve 
the use of essential plant oils to combat health 
ailments that are traditionally cured using man- 
made drugs. Methods such as aromatherapy and other 
herbal remedies are replacing synthetic medications. 
Can we believe that natural herbs can aid health 
problems as effectively as highly researched and ac­
claimed man-made drugs? “In general, there is a certain 
degree of power of mind over matter that can help cure 
illness,” said Jenny Good, a fifth-year scholar.
Good was part of a mini-course on alternative health 
offered at Carnegie Mellon, originally created by 
Denise Soultanian,. Many different facets of alter­
native health were discussed, structured around 
the topics of massage, aromatherapy, and the 
healing theories surrounding them.
One of the most notable topics cropping 
up in the recent fascination with natural 
healing is aromatherapy. As Good and 
her classmates studied, aromatherapy 
is essentially the use of plant oils to 
better one’s overall health. You can 
find aromatherapy products on any 
street in Pittsburgh, from a small 
herbal boutique to the beauty section 
of Giant Eagle. This ever-growing 
treatment utilizes the ability of herbal 
scents and plant oils to dictate mood 
and well being. The effects of 
aromatherapy are attained through 
herbal baths, teas, oils, and eating 
foods which contain these oils.
Oils are derived from the leaves, 
flowers, seeds, roots, and barks of 
plants and then transformed into 
aromatic “potions” which can be 
coupled with a massage or bath or 
inhaled. The essential oils in turn 
can produce moods of relaxation, 
calm, energy, or other positive feel­
ings. Peppermint, one common ex­
ample, is used to ease an upset stom­
ach, chamomile aids in relaxation, 
and Ginseng produces energy.
Above and beyond soothing baths, 
teas, and energy boosters, alternative 
medicine claims to be the cure for much 
more critical health ailments. From ane­
mia to multiple sclerosis to drug withdrawal, 
herbs attempt to heal without the aid of syn­
thetic pharmaceutical drugs.
Like the many common drugstores in Pitts­
burgh, where traditional prescriptions or over-the- 
counter remedies can be found, there are numerous

Museum features Rusyn culture
By LISETTE MILLER-DEXON

In a city like Pittsburgh where cul­
tural identity is worn proudly, it is 
unusual that one of its most recog­
nized figures, Andy Warhol, is not im­
mediately associated with his cultural 
background. History may have ne-

Music of the Carpathio-Rusyn people was part of a celebration of 
Andy Warhol’s cultural heritage last Saturday.
Sokolowski and Program Coordinator 
Maritza Mosquera, welcomed guests to 
the first annual Extravaganza.
The museum and the Carpatho-Rusyn 
Society collaborated for the first time to 
create the event. The Carpatho-Rusyn 
region is located in mountains shared by 
Slovakia, Poland, and the Ukraine. Pitts­
burgh holds the largest population of 
the region’s immigrants in the United 
States. Warhol’s father immigrated in 
1913 during the 
40-year period 
from 1880 to 1920 
when half the 
region’s popula­
tion came to the 
United States. In 
1921 his mother 
. followed, and it is 
from her that 
Warhol gained 
his strong cul­
tural ties.
A slide show 
hosted by John 
Righetti, presi­
dent of the 
Carpatho-Rusyn 
Society, intro­
duced the viewer 
to the Eastern Eu­
ropean Moun­
tains that are
glected to notice, but on Saturday, the 
Andy Warhol Museum and the 
Carpatho-Rusyn Society held its first 
celebration of Warhol’s Carpatho- 
Rusyn origins.
The Carpatho-Rusyn Easter Egg Ex­
travaganza began with an ensemble of 
cultural displays including traditional 
dance, music, and song. Opening re­
marks, given by Museum Director Tom
home to villages reminiscent of what one 
might expect to find before the modern­
ization of the 20th century. Images of 
traditional dance events, woodcarvings, 
highly decorative clothing, and religious 
icons were accompanied by music from 
the region. The images provided a view of 
a landscape that contained rolling moun­
tains and small villages that nestled up 
to forests’ edges. At its heart, the slide
show presented the intimacy found by a 
pilgrim who has come to find his origins 
and is confronted by a familiar feeling. 
The honesty of the slide show belied the 
draw of the photographer to images and 
objects of cultural significance.
The afternoon schedule included vari­
ous events occurring throughout the mu­
seum. Individuals were free to move from 
one thing to the next at their own pace and 
focus on individual aspects of the culture 
that were shown. Traditional storytelling. 
in both Rusyn and English offered a sense 
of the values esteemed by the people of the 
region and their language. Egg-painting 
was featured in another area of the mu­
seum. Traditional designs and techniques 
were demonstrated, and the religious sig­
nificance of the eggs was explained. Work­
shops were set up for children and adults 
to try their hand at egg-painting and reli­
gious icon-making.
The music of the region was well- 
represented by a number of performances 
held throughout the day. Instruments 
such as the cimbalom and the accordion 
accompanied choir groups and soloists. 
Multiple generations of Rusyns listened 
and sang along to songs that have re­
mained virtually unchanged since they 
were brought to America.
Closing events re focused on Andy 
Warhol’s heritage. Ray Herbehick of Uni­
versity of Dayton gave a lecture on the 
presence of religion in Warhol’s achieve­
ments. He presented his views on Warhol’s 
display of cultural influence in his art.
The collaborative effort between the 
Society and the museum was an over­
whelming success. The Carpatho- 
Rusyn heritage and beliefs were ex­
plained and effectively displayed so 
that a person previously unfamiliar 
with them could leave well-informed.
Herbal remedies aid health ailments

vendors offering herbal treatments. 
Cloud Nine, on St. Lawrence Avenue, 
and Golden Seal, on Murray Avenue, 
are two local vendors. Also, you can join 
The Herb Society of America to get up­
dates on concoctions and effective plant 
extracts.
A case in point is the widely acclaimed 
herb St. John’s Wart, made from a root, 
usually in the form of a pill. St. John’s 
Wort is one of the most popular herbs 
used to combat common illnesses. The 
root contains hypericin, a compound that
helps support the nervous system. 
Deemed the natural prozac, alternative 
health claims it as a treatment for de­
pression patients. It has also been found 
to inhibit the growth of HIV and AIDS in 
animals. Some claim it is a crucial ele­
ment in maintaining overall well-being.
Another prevalent herb in alterna­
tive health is Ginkgo biloba. Usually 
combined with other herbs, this herb 
is a recent popular alternative to tak­
ing hormones during menopause. 
Widely used in China, Ginkgo is also 
effective in repairing brain damage
and improving memory and concen­
tration. The U.S. market has tapped 
into Ginkgo as a popular treatment for 
PMS, and even as an attempt to treat 
Alzheimer’s disease.
Perhaps placing stock in some herbal 
remedies is merely the catalyst for the 
mind to triumph over health ailments, 
while easing the body and spirit. “I think 
a lot of philosophy on alternative medi­
cine boils down to a person recognizing 
that there are real possibilities out there 
besides the Western scientific medi­
cines,” said Good.
Slapstick enhances comedy’s brilliance

this complex, very physical act.
The third act, while still very funny,

production values — the actors’ tim­
ing remains right on, the physical
ByALEXLEWIN
Tartan Staffwriter
Dying is easy. Comedy is hard.
Which makes Noises Off that much 
more impressive.
The play, which opened last Friday gags are still funny. But playwright 
at University of Pittsburgh’s Stephen Michael Frayn has pretty much 
Foster Memorial Theatre, is a 
farce of the highest order. In Act I, 
we see a rehearsal for a cliched 
British sex comedy, entitled Noth­
ing On. The actors keep inter­
rupting the rehearsal to ask ques­
tions about motivation, or to 
search for a missing contact lens 
or search for a missing actor. All 
this with less than 24 hours until 
the opening performance.
Act II probably represents the 
funniest half-hour of my life 
(though I grant my life has not 
been an especially funny one).
The set has been turned around, 
and we watch the actors back­
stage during the opening perfor­
mance. By this point, individual 
conflicts have been set up — the 
director is sleeping with one of 
his actresses and cheating on her courtesy Pitt Drama
with the stage manager; two of Noises 0ff is a comedic Pla* within a P|a*- 
the actors, Garry and Dotty, are hav- dropped the personal conflicts he 
ing a romantic spat; and the company’s 
elder statesman, Selsdon Mowbray, 
keeps disappearing and missing his 
entrances in favor of a tall drink.
In this act, all the angst and passion 
of these, and other, conflicts come out.
Dotty ties Garry’s shoelaces together 
before one of his entrances; we hear 
him go crashing down the stairs on 
stage a minute later. Two of the ac­
tors, each of whom has to make a quick 
costume change, accidentally tie their 
costumes together before stumbling 
out on stage. Another actor trips on 
the box that controls the lighting and 
turns off the house lights.
There is so much going on in this 
scene, so many people angry at so 
many others for so many reasons, that
worked so hard to set up in Acts I and 
II. In the third act, the stage is turned 
back around, and we see a later per­
formance ofNothing On, and of course, ; 
it is completely screwed up. But be- . 
cause we’re not backstage, we don’t 
know why. We don’t know who is mad 
at whom and how it affects the action 
on stage. The great, bombshell at the 
end of Act II — the stage manager’s 
revelation that she is pregnant with 
the director’s child — is never ad-> 
dressed again.
But in the end, watching the actors 
foul everything up is funn}1- enough to 
make us forgive the narrative gaps. In 
comedy you have to keep topping your­
self, you have to keep being funnier 
than you were with the last joke. And 
you can’t keep up with more than half Michael Frayn knows how to do just . 
of it, and you really don’t need to. Just that — luckily he’s got Coleman and a 
watching how they take stabs at each terrific cast of actors to bring his farce : 
other, and how completely they screw perfectly to life, 
up their play, is enough to keep you
laughing from start to finish. Director Noises Off is playing through April 
W. Stephen Coleman and the entire 19. For more information call624-PLAY.;
Interactive art project creates emotional links for participants
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Contributing Editor
Their abstract uses the key­
words telepresence, remote love, 
and surrogate self. Their artwork 
; features remote booths and “para- 
¦ dise in a can,” And yes, their ex­
hibit featured nude avatars. But 
the most important aspect the 
The Centre for Metahuman Ex­
ploration displayed at their re­
ception last Saturday was a mind- 
stimulating experience.
Project Paradise, the thesis ex- 
hibition for MFA students Peter
Coppin and Alexi Morrissey, con­
sists of two elements: isolation 
booths and a hidden remote envi­
ronment. The two booths each 
contain a video monitor and a 
phone. “People are culturally ha­
bituated their entire life to im­
mediately pick up a [ringing] tele­
phone,” said Coppin.
The enivorment is Paradise, a 
closed room filled with foliage, 
video cameras, and two human 
models: Adam and Eve each 
hooked up to a robotic arm. When 
a participant enters the booth, 
the phone rings. Answering the

phone turns on the monitor. Us­
ers then push the buttons on the 
touch-tone phone to send signals 
to the robotic arm, moving it so 
that remote hands can pet Adam 
or Eve. The idea is that the ava­
tars act as first person emotional 
sensors to the user back in the 
booth — that this emotional con­
nection will augment the techni­
cal sensory input. A crowd of 
about 100 tested the theory. For 
some, the exhibit worked. Oth­
ers had capricious concerns 
about the technical or sexual 
aspects of the show. But for all 
involved, it definitely evoked an 
emotional response.
“I think the weirdest thing is 
I’m over here and they’re over 
there, but it feels like we’re in the 
same room,” said Tori Gardner, 
first-year art major. “When you’re 
in the booth, you don’t think about 
[the distance].”
“It’s just kind ofjolting that you 
have control over another person’s 
hand in such an intimate situa­
tion,” said Maryiln Goodrich, a 
Boston-based painter and 
Morrissey’s mother.
“It was kinky,” said Rich Pell, a 
senior art major. “I think there 
needs to be a cool-down room. I’m 
glad there’s not alcohol here.” 
“It was better than online 
porn, not as good as the real 
thing,” said Jeremy Kreigel, a 
senior art major. Kreigel 
thought that the exhibit was a 
step towards the artists’ goal. “I 
think what we have here is as­
sisted telepresence.”
“It was frustrating,” said 
Adam Guilkis, also a senior art 
major. “You’ve got this antici­
pation, you see what’s happen­
ing, you know what’s going on, 
but it’s not there. So the result 
is tele-frustration.” Guilkis sug­
gested a more intuitive method 
of control, like a glove that could

control the arm.
Kreigel and Guilkis did not like 
the fact that after answering the 
phone, the exhibit doesn’t pro­
vide audio communication with 
the avatars.
“After reflecting on my expe­
rience, it occured to me that 
this person could be an exten­
sion of me,” said Koichi 
Delaney-Karell, senior civil 
engineering major. “I had no 
idea there was going to be a 
naked woman inside. If it wasn’t 
something people are so leery 
of, I could have been like ‘Oh, 
this could be really deep.’ ”
“It was like a power trip kind of 
thing,” said “Adam,” sophomore 
art major Terry Young. ‘You 
don’t think of it as being objecti­
fied [when using the robot].”
“It’s emotionally wearing be­
cause you’re acting the whole 
time,” said ‘Eve,’ first-year art 
major Lauren Lamonica.
“An hour and a half is a long 
time to be in love,” said Young. 
Coppin and Morrissey will get 
more reactions when they take 
the exhibition to SIGRAPH ’98 in 
Florida this summer.
“We’re going to take our data, 
we’re going to record it, then see 
what we can do with it,” said 
Coppin. The Centre hopes to 
eventually adapt the system for 
a wider appeal. “That’s the main 
thing, to apply it to the Internet 
or TV. We don’t have immersive 
environments that help us gain 
physical sensations,” Coppin
said. But the artists think they’re 
in the right place to create sue]? 
a system.
“It requires a place like CMU 
that has people like [Robotics 
Institute head] Red Whittaker 
and [School of Art head] Bryan 
Rodgers ... who have the ability 
to merge previously unmergeel 
systems in order to create some­
thing new,” Morrissey said.
“Being around those types of 
people is fundamental to ou£ 
existence.”
The Centre for Metahuman 
Exploration will hold a lecture 
April 9, 12-2pm, performances 
Api'il 11 and 18, l—3pm, and the 
exhibt will be open until April 30. 
937 Gallery is located downtown

There are two types of 
rockabilly in this world: the mel­
low, slow-as-Kentucky-molasses 
kind and the high-octane formula 
bom of stock car races and am­
phetamines. The Amazing Royal 
Crowns are like a souped-up ver­
sion of the latter, blowing the 
doors off of your stereo from the 
word go.
Who: The Amazing
F imI R°yal Cr°wnsjjBSrajH What: The Amazing 
R°YalCrowns 
^IA ComPany: Velvel
The Amazing Royal Crowns, 
who take their name from a can 
of hair grease, are a swinging 
quartet composed of vocals, gee- 
tar, stringbass, and drums. Their 
self-titled disc pushes the bound­
ary between rockabilly and punk 
through 14 tracks inspired by 
Tennessee whiskey, fried chicken, 
and demolition derbies.
Foremost, the Crowns are an 
incredibly fun band. They tug the 
dancing fool out of even the least 
foolish of you people. I, being not 
in the least part foolish, was 
caught shaking it like a countri­
fied swinger on numerous occa­
sions. Even if you hate all things 
country, The Amazing Royal 
Crowns get their greasy 
punkabilly licks under your skin.
Music-wise, these 
guys are tight. Johnny 
“The GoloneF Maguire 
uses his Gretsch guitar 
to lay the heart of the 
songs, plucking a 
twangy sound from that 
thang. Overlay that 
with the jumping slaps 
of Jack “The Swinger”
Hanlon’s upright 
double bass for added 
groove, and the non­
stop hop-til-you-drop 
drum barrage from 
Judd Williams, and you 
have that crazy sound 
that has all the kids 
dancing. And as the fin­
ishing touch; Jason 
“King” Kendall pro­
vides the vocal presence 
that spurs more sing- 
alongs than a camp fire, 
s’mores, and all the versions of 
“Kumbaya” in the world.
The Crowns pull out every 
trick in the book for their al­
bum. On the second track, “Do 
the Devil,” they throw in a horn 
section for kicks. It gives the 
song a brassy, thick feel, mak­
ing it an unnatural fusion of 
“Peter Gunn” and “DuelingBan­
jos.” The song also became the 
video that won best video at the 
1997 Boston Music Awards.
Most, of the lyrics in the songs 
aren’t heavy-duty brain-bending 
issues of love and life, but that

Maguire, and Jack Hanlon) play a mean guitar stomp on their debut album.
goes with The Crowns’ ethic of 
good times. If you want poetry, 
try Walt Whitman. If you want 
catchy choruses that you can 
scream along to in between shots 
of liquor, I do'believe we’ve found 
the right band for you.
The one song without words 
(known as an “instrumental” in 
the business), “Gretschy,” leaps 
and roars even without King 
Kendall’s help. It’s a eight-cylin­
der guitar expedition down a dark 
and lonely country highway with 
the pedal to the metal. “Gretsch/’ 
is reminiscent of every chase scene
in any movie or television show, 
especially the part in the Dukes of 
Hazzard when them Duke boys 
jump the General Lee over the 
requisite ravine or river bed.
For a bunch of good-old-boys 
playing in a musical genre born 
in the ’50s, The Crowns sound 
remarkably up-to-date. While 
they borrow the twang and the 
shuffle, the flair and the hopped- 
up-on-goofballs mentality is all 
’90s. So there’s no need to fear if 
you hate the sung-through-the- 
nose style of Garth Brooks; these 
guys most definitely rock.

holiday fun whileL O S TIN S PA C E
When Will Robinson isn't busy looking for danger, he can usually be found 
looking for Easter eggs. Though this makes sense on Easter Sunday when kids 
across the universe are looking for those elusive colored eggs, it doesn't seem to 
make sense on other days of the year. Actually, it does. Just because the Easter 
Beagle collects the still-hidden eggs on Earth, he doesn't have the time to re­
trieve ones scattered on distant planets. That's where little Willy comes in. He 
has the honor of collecting all of the remaining Easter eggs. Plus, he gets the 
luxury of eating all of the eggs he can. When you are stuck with eating Ora­
tions all of the time, scrambled eggs 
with a cherry on top are very ap­
petizing. In fact, there are many 
other ways to eat eggs, like 
egg Jell-O or egg fig 
newtons. Look for 
these recipes at a the- 
ater near you.

Easter Break is just around the comer and that means that it Is 
time again to wait for the vaunted Easter Beagle to come deliver all 
that is promised. Mr. Vox isn’t talking about candied hearts because 
frankly, that's the wrong holiday. Mr. Vox just wants to get his share 
of Easter Eggs because it seems that no one else will give him any­
thing, not even Santa Claus. But that's okay. Mr. Vtox has already turned 
to a life of crime and looks forward to robbing a convenience store 
near you.
