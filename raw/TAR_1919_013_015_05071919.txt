DEAN BREED SPEAKS AT M. M. ASSEMBLY
The assembly held in M. M. on 
¡Wednesday, April 20, was really an in­
formal address to the students by 
Dean Breed. The Dean announced 
that many prominent men will be 
asked to speak, later in the quarter, 
-if the attendance at the next two as­
semblies warrants it. The assembly 
taf May 7 wlil be a student assembly, 
tthat of May 14 will be an address by 
fDr. Goldenson, of the Rodef Shalom 
Temple.
Next, the Dean spoke of the suc­
cess of the night students in every 
way and of their spirit and efficiency, 
and how they had been, organized into 
self-governing clubs by Marguerite 
Spilman.
Dean Breed finished her address by 
telling the students that M. M. now 
las two gold stars. The first of these 
s for Miss Harriet Ellis, a graduate 
3f the first graduating class of Mar­
garet Morrison, 10 years ago. Miss 
Ellis had worked her way through 
college, and in 1909 started some tea- 
ooms in Cincinnati. Long before the 
United States entered the war, she 
ivent over as a relief worker. Later 
¡he joined the American Red Cross 
anteen Service. It was while she 
vas engaged in this work, that she 
ied, as a result of overwork and the 
hardships she endured. Margaret 
Morrison’s second gold star is for 
Iiss Marie Belleville, of class 1909, 
rlio not only came to M. M. as a pupil, 
ul. as a teacher as well. She left in 
916, to go into war work with the 
I. W. C. A. She .died this winter in 
hina, where she had been doing mis- 
ionary work. Dean Breed closed her 
ddress by saying how great was the 
:riof felt by all who knew this sweet, 
¡ympathetic and kind nature.

Tartan Staff Girls 
Have Fudge Party
Fudge and Printer’s Ink may seem a. 
queer combination, but to the Mar­
garet Morrison girls nothing is im­
possible. And when out of those girls 
you pick The Tartan Staff, you have 
the superlative of good times. (Was 
this written by a member of the 
Staff?) Several times during the year 
these girls have decided that all work 
wasn't a bit of fun, so they attempted 
to relieve the monotony.
This time the digression was in the 
form of a fudge party held ta the 
home of one of the girls. (Censored!) 
Did you ever have exactly all the 
fudge (the kind mother used to make) 
you wanted? Well, you would have 
had' this time. The only thing that 
marred the pleasure of the party for 
these five girls, was the fact that in­
digestion followed. .(Censored!) We 
feel sure that if the entire school had 
known that such a thing would take 
place, there would have been a loud 
clamoring for Tartan positions.
This is not the only affair The 
Tartan girls have had. Earlier in the 
year Helen Young entertained the 
“young editors” at her home. These | 
accomplished (?) writers are evidently 
accomplished fun makers and fudge ! 
makers as well. .
THE COMMITTEE THAT 
WELCOMES THEM HOME
&
TENNIS DANCE SUCCESSFUL
About 100 couples attended Tech's 
irst tennis dance Saturday evening 
ind enjoyed as fine an 'all school 
lance as has been held in the Union
ii his season. Music was furnished 
y McNemry’s Orchestra, and the 
ancing lasted from S:30 to 12 
j’clock. Punch, of a grade unusual 
it athletic dances, was served, indi­
cting that the management desired 
lfto show the students a good time as 
1 veil as to provide funds for the 
r inancing of a first class tennis sched­
ule.
The students were honored by the 
presence of Colonel Brooks, coach 
ri6f the tennis team, who acted as 
haperon.
Another tennis dance is to be held 
ate in May, from all reports, prom­
ts to be even better than the one
leld Saturday.
The committee in charge of the en­
tertainment of the "Tech” men with 
the 15th Engineers was appointed 
yesterday. by Dr. Arthur Arton Ham- 
erschlag, President of the Carnegie In- 
stil.ute of Technology, who returned 
from New York. The committee is 
lieadied by Dr. Thomas Stockton 
Baker, Secretary of the Institute; I 
Arthur W. Tarbell, Dean of Men; j 
Fred J. Hartman, Assistant Registrar; i 
W. Frank Hitchens, of the Department | 
of Agriculture; Jay L. O'Hara, of; 
the Engineering Department, and j 
Captain Henry J. McCorkle, of the j 
Bureau of Recommendations.
While in New York, Dr. Hamer-1 
schlag welcomed the 15th on the pier. 
Major Archbold, Captain Duff, ‘‘Sun- J 
ny” Kesner, all were in the pink of 
condition and eager to get home. It J 
is now strictly up to the military a:u-1 
thorities as to when the boys will be 
demobilized, and all “Tech" is keyed 
up waiting for the signal to break 
loose, for “Tech” takes a personal 
pride in the 15th, owing to the num­
ber of “Tech” men in (the outfit The 
student body has become aroused, and 
both faculty and student body will be 
in line, side by side, f to stage the 
greatest celebration ever known in the 
history of “Tech.” It is next to im­
possible to check up all the old “Tech” 
men in this famous regiment of fight­
ers, but “Tech” has resorted to every 
human means to make the roster as 
complete as possible. It is believed 
demobilization will be completed be­
fore May 9, the date of the Fourteenth 
Annual Home Concert of the Tech 
Musical Clubs, as all “Tech” is anx­
ious that the fighters shall be properly 
serenaded. So far, about 50 names 
are on the roster of the 15th, who have I 
been identified as ‘Tech” men, and; 
every day “Tech” graduates and I 
alumni are phoning in the names of j 
others.---------------------------
HOME CONCERT PROGRAM
Famous Alumni Quartet to Appear—Signor Scalzo to Play
Fricla}'; evening at 8:15 sharp the Carnegie Tech Musical Clubs 
will appear for the fourteenth time before the Pittsburgh public 
ancl the student body at Carnegie Music Hall.
Those who heard last year’s concert will be surprised to hear that 
this year’s clubs have planned to surpass it in all respects. Under 
the expert direction oil Mr. Crawford and Signor Scalzo, the clubs 
have reached a high degree of perfection. The program will appeal 
to everyone, composed, as it is, of both popular and classical music. 
One of the most interesting features oli the program will be the 
appearance of the famous Lyric Quartet. This quartet is composed 
of Tech alumni of the 1913 class and is well known throughout the 
c.ountry. The members oI: the quartet are R. and'E., Hodgdon, R. 
M. Crawford, the director of the Glee Club, and R. R. Rose. This 
organization met with such remarkable success while with I he Mu­
sical Clubs that it toured the country as a professional organization. 
It was broken up by the war, but is now reunited and will appear 
at this year’s Home Concert for the first time since before the war.
Another feature will be a unique specialty devised by Mi*. Craw­
ford. The details of this feature are being kept secret. And then 
there is the string quartet composed of Messrs. Balaurie, Sweeny, 
Faville and Eller ton. These boys are masters of jazz and you will 
have a hard time keeping your feet; still when they once, begin. The 
clubs are fortunate in having J. A. ‘Willard as a reader, who has met 
with singular success throughout the season. Mr. Willard is the 
winner'of the gold medal for his readings in the Western Pennsylva­
nia Interscholastic Literary Contest ol! 1917.
Two numbers 01: the program have been written by Tech men. 
Mr. A. Vcscial, whose march is one of the features of the Mandolin 
Club is a student of the Design Night School. Mr. Weninger, of the 
Glee Club, is the composer of the “Alma Mater,” which is the closing 
number.
After the concert there will be a dance in the Syria. Mosque 
which will be the fitting conclusion to the biggest event ol! the .year.
KHAKI COLLEGE CHEMISTS REORGANIZED
,The man who probably started the 
movement that was responsible for 
the founding of the various schools 
across the sea for the education of 
soldiers was Colonel Day.
When invalided back of the lines 
his restive spirit longed for action. 
As he could not return to the firing 
line, he turned his attention to the j 
betterment of the condition of the 
soldier. He found many men in the 
ranks who had laid down their books 
and studies to enter the army, he 
found many whose outlook on life had 
been stripped clear and who for the 
first time realized the force of educa­
tion and learning. So Colonel Day 
founded the first “Khaki College” 
among his own men and became the 
first president of this institution. For­
mer professors and instructors were 
drawn from the ranks, and the former 
students picked up the tangled 
threads of education where they-had I 
been laid down. Arrangements were 
made with the universities at home to j
French Cripple 
Thanks M. M.
A letter came to M. M. D. recently, 
which every Margaret Morrison girl 
was proud to receive. It came from 
the little French girl whose leg was 
shot off by a Gorman bomb, and who 
was furnished with an artificial limb 
by the girls of M. M. D.
A free translation follows:
Dear American Friends:
I am sending you this lottor today, 
which I hope will give you all pleas­
ure. It is to thank you for your kind­
ness In giving me this wonderful .sur­
prise. I would have thanked you 
sooner, but did not know your address.

Fund for French Wounded gavo mo

One of the clubs that has started up 
again since the close of the, war Is 
the Chemist’s Club of the Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology. This club, 
which has 75 members, is recruited 
from the three upper classes of Tech, 
as the Freshmen are not eligible to 
membership. It was organized four \ 
years ago with the ostensible purpose1 
of promoting a better understanding 
among the chemists graduating from 
the Institute, and at regular intervals 
has prominent men in the chemical 
world appear before the club and make 
addresses on live subjects. The mov­
ing spirit in the club is David A. 
Nemser of Hartford, Conn., whose pic­
ture appears at. the extreme right of 
the four front men. Mr. Nemser, who 
is president of the club, is a graduate 
of Hartford Pligh School, 1915, and is 
a Senior in Science and Chemistry. 
Standing to the left of Mr. Nemser is 
Professor Howard C. Griffin of the.

the School of Chemistry and one of 
the best known men of his line in the

WESTMINSTER GAME AGAIN POSTPONED
The baseball situation at Tech has 
been rather backward, due partly to 
hard luck among the players and 
partly to a conspiracy on the part of 
Jupiter Pluvlus. Several of the best 
players have been kept out of the 
game, some with injuries physlcull; 
'and some with scholastic injuries 
that, must be cured before they can 
return. G'odden, one of the catchers, 
•made a quick throw before warming 
up early in the season and has had 
a sore arm ever since. Luviue, an­
other. catcher, lias- had a scholastic 
embargo on himself for a week.
The game due to bo played with 
Westminster has been postponed 
twice while the Bethany game has 
been cancelled due to internal trou­
bles at. Bethany. The Westminster 
game is to be played on Friday, May
16. For the balance of the season 
Tech will take on some of Mie best 
teams in this heck of the woods. 'On 
Thursday the team plays the Lebanon 
Valley team. On May 9 they meet 
the Bethlohem Steel Company’s crack 
team away from home and on- the 
following day they clash with Lehigh 
University. Both these teams are 
snappy clean hitters and dandy 
fielders and will make Tech stop live­
ly. On May 17 the Tech-Bethany 
fracas is again scheduled while on 
the 21st Tech will cross bat-s with 
the Ohio Wesleyan University, one 
of the best college teams In the sis­
ter state. From O. W. U., Tech 
heads back to Indiana Normal and 
lino up against this dangerous outfit 
on May 24. They then como back to 
Pittsburgh In time to moot Musk­
ingum on May 29. While at home.

M. M. NIGHT STUDENTS HOLD LIVELY BANQUET
The Night School (Muh Students of 
Margaret Morrison, of whom there are 
over 350, and for whom school ,1s as 
much a. recreation as a work, were 
given a hamiuet by the Western Penn, 
sylvan la League of Women Workers, 
on Tuesday, April 21), In the Margaret 
Morrison Building. The principles of 
the League are self-goyornmont, self- 
support and non-soctiirlanlsm.
A dellclouA supper was served at 
6:30, where In addition to the many 
songs and cheers, the girls wo'ro ad­
dressed by the following speakers: 
Miss Iloblnspn, who was toast- 
mlstress’; Miss Ida Allorton, who Is 
the State president of the League; 
Mrs. Pollock, president of the National 
League of Women Workers; President; 
Ilamerschlag and Doan Brood. The 
speeches wore much appreciated by 
the largo audience, Doan Breed's 
statement that "You are self-support­
ing, If, whon you lose your Job, you are 
up against II," won a responsive echo 
In the hearts of all present.
MR. ROBERT CRAWFORD
Mr. Crawford, the director of the 
Glee Club, graduated from the School 
of Applied Science in 1913. lie was 
a member of the Glee Club and of 
the Varsity Quartet during his four 
years In college. Me was the popular 
'bariitono as well as manager and 
president.
It was during his term as presi­
dent. ol” the clubs, that, the informal 
second half program was Introduced. 
After graduation ho and the other 
members of the quai'teL formed tiio 
famous Lyric CJuartet and Loured the 
Middle West.
It is this spirit of unselfish sacri­
fice on the part of the alumni to 
come and direct the clubs, that 
should encourage every undergrade 
uate to better effort.
WHAT OTHERS SAY 
FOR MUSICAL CLUBS
The most flattering reporls have 
been reaching Manager Faville of the 
Munsical Clubs since their return from 
their trip. That the concerts were 
great successes is shown by the 
write-ups that the local papers of 
New Castle, Warren and Youngs­
town have devoted to the clubs, The 
clubs met with enthusiastic recep­
tions In every town they visited and 
the different towns visited by the 
clubs vied with one another in pro­
viding entertainment for the mem­
bers of the aggregation. The clubs 
were guests at large dances after 
the concerts in Warren and Youngs­
town. Elaboate plans for a dance 
and entertainment In Now Castle 
were spoiled by a heavy rainstorm, 
but the,good times in Warren and 
Voungstown made up for the loss. 
At each city, the members were en­
tertained at. private homes and the 
cordial reception tendered them will 
long be remembered by everyone In. 
tli clubs. As If I heir hospitality was 
not enough, all the cities promised

THE HOME CONCERT
The home concert is a performance that no real “Tccli man” 
will care to miss. Precedents of performance and attendance have 
been set in former years and it is the policy of the clubs to surpass 
the results thus', far attained.
The clubs oil last year labored under the difficulties caused by 
the cogencies caused by the war. TJie clubs this year- have not been 
thus annoyed, and the result is a club of a standard of excellence 
unsurpassed'.
The sale of tickets has been high, the fraternities doing excep­
tionally well for clubs, Y>. L. E. leading with 68.
You will regret it if you fail to come.
CONSIDERATION AT LEAST
The students of the School of Applied Industries presented their 
case to the “Triumvirate” that are “applying” P. T. This cele­
brated trio heard I lie students’ objections and admitted them but at 
the same time never even went to the trouble of appearing, before 
the students and explaining why their claims could not be realised.
.A. .student has a mind. .A. college is a place to develop it, and a 
college that tramples upon a student’s right to freedom ol! thought as 
guilty ol! hindering and not stimulating mental development and 
thereby misses the real purpose for its existence.
THISTLE POSTERS
The various posters around school stimulating interest in the 
Thistle, are nutde, hi every‘one knows, by the various departments of 
.Design School, Those posters entitle the maker lo credit in his 
scholastic record for that work. All these posters are yet unercditod.
This then is the point, Three ol! these posters have walked away. 
It is not the value ol’ the poster that the makers regret, it is the fact 
(Iml they have not received credit for them. Therefore, since you 
Would hate to have a notebook “stolen” or a paper taken that it 
took you hours to prepare, return the posters. It is only honorable 
lo do so. At least nsM fair I
A GOOD EXAMPLE
Friday one ol’ the seniors-—-a prominent man around school and 
a member of (lie Student. Activities Board, walked across the grass 
in front of Science School. Very truly indeed, this was a good exam­
ple to other students. It was not the damage done to the grass* but 
how about what others think? Think this over, Senior!
Show your appreciation of the 15th, by buying, as well as shout­
ing NOTES OF VICTORY. The man who can earn or save enough 
money to buy a bond, and doesn't, isn’t much better than the man 
who doesn't turn out to weloeem the engineers.
See to it that Tech goes further over its Victory Bond quota 
than any other college.
A free thinker over at Margaret Morrison wants to know, when is 
a holiday not a holiday? The answer of course is, when one has to 
make it up.on Saturday.
Editorials take up lots of useful room.

Official Announcements
The Carnegie Institute of Technology is concerned with teaching

they try their skill with the Pitts­
burgh Collegians pn June 5 and two 
days later stack up against Penn 
State at'State College. Three days 
later they repeat the performance 
at the same place. Their last home 
game is with Indiana Nomal on 
June 14 and then close their season 
011 June 21 in .a clash with the strong 
Wilkinsburg Club at Willdnsbprg.
Tho Tech schedule'lias been ideal­
ly arranged with a view to giving 
the Kilties some much needed ex­
perience as they are .largely young­
sters and a year hence should more 
than hold their own with any of the 
college or semi-pro teams'in the Cen­
tral States.
The gods have been extremely kind 
in providing I-lonus Wagner for the 
guidance of the Tech baseball des­
tinies as the “Old Veteran” has 
many times demonstrated he was far 
from a. has-been and the cold base­
ball brains 'he showed in the Tech- 
Duke game was largely responsible 
for the Tech win. Hoiius sent the 
veteran, Captain Gretzler to the out­
field where his long legs and calcu­
lating eye cut off several dangerous 
situations. McCaw, an unknown 
youngster, was sent to the mound. 
The result speaks for itself. Tech 
won by 5 to 3. McCaw, the young 
ster, fanned fourteen Duke batsmen, 
gave but two passes and allowed 
only five hits, three of which were 
decidedly scratchy.
Taken all in all, the Techs, have 
had only one opportunity to show 
what they could dp, but have been 
absorbing “inside baseball” from 
the “wiliest old fox” in the game 
and not only do the prospects for the 
balance of the season look exceeding­
ly bright, but the rainbow of promise 
for next year’s team indicates that 
I-Ionus is building up a piachine that, 
will be well nigh unbeatable.*

that the wind blew the glass out of 
the motorman’s cab, so they had to

The motorman attempted to pass a

Greek, French, Agriculture, Gas En­

highly successful career both in vau­

One day recently a dilapidated, apa­

Syracuse Medical college and offered 
to sell his body cheap, adding that he 
was out of work and almost discour­
aged. "You’re almost discouraged, are 
you?” rejoined the superintendent, who 
always tried to change the determina­

man, If you sold your body to us the 
first chance our students got they’d 
take the heart out of.you entirely!”

One of the most interesting photo­

been booked for showing at. the Now 
Million Dollar Grand throughout next 
week, starting Monday morning, May
12. It is Anita Stewart’s new silent - 
drama, "Mary Regan,” made fom 
Leroy Scott’s magazimj stories of 
which Mary Regan was the principal 
character. The picture is a thrilling 
tale of the cafe, police and high so­
ciety circles of New York, related 
with an almost unequalled quality of 
mystery, romance and the elements 
of surprise. The picture has been 
provided with an excellent cast, and 
an effort has been made to have 
costumes and settings super-fine.
