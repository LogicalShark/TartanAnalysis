A building like this is the best 
monument of what the twentieth cen­
tury has accomplished. The really 
important part of the history of a na­
tion is the development of its ideals 
and standards. The specific things 
that it does are important not so 
much for their own sake, but for the 
sake of the evidence they give as to 
the trend of a nation’s thought. It 
is not the magnitude of the individual 
battles which makes a war worth 
reading about. It is the ideas under 
which the war is conducted and the 
constitutional principles for which it 
is fought. It is not the census figures 
which decide whether a nation is 
great or small. It is the industrial 
methods and educational ideas which 
these census figures indicate. And in 
like manner it is not the buildings 
and machines and railroads and mines 
which constitute the important part 
of the history of the engineering pro­
fession. A book might give a good 
description of a thousand of these 
great engineering works, and yet fail 
of being in any sense a true history 
of engineering progress. The thought 
of the successive builders and the in­
fluence of that thought upon the con­
duct and ideals of other men are the 
things that we really care about. The 
story of the concrete achievements 
that have dazzled the eye of the 
world is the unimportant and super­
ficial part of the history. The real 
thing for which we care, the thing 
that helps us to understand the past

On last Monday evening Prof. 
Trinlts delivered a lecture on “Smoke 
Consumption’’ before the Pittsburg 
Board of Trade. His remarks were 
preceded by those of Mr. Shallen- 
berger, who showed some of the 
methods of gauging the denseness of 
smoke, and other methods of han­
dling the proposition.
In introducing Prof. Trinks the 
presiding officer called attention to the 
fact that home talent was not good 
enough, so the officials of the Tech 
Schools turned to Germany for the 
best teachers.
Prof. Trinks remarked at the be­
ginning of his talk that he had had 
very little experience in the actual 
firing of boilers, as he had served as 
a fireman only a short time, but that 
he had read a great number of re­
ports of tests of boilers where good 
combustion had been the object.
He then showed by means of a 
common oil lamp, how the flame gets 
smoky if enough hot air is not sup­
plied, and how it smokes also if too 
much cold air is allowed access to the 
flame. •'
Prof. Trinks then mentioned this 
application in connection with hand 
fired boilers where the fireman throwrs 
on a lot of green coal and enough air 
is not aupplied, thus making a lot of 
smoke.
He then mentioned two methods of 
preventing this excessive smoke—one 
by heaping the coal up in the center 
and allowing the air to flow over the 
flame until it is heated, and another 
by allowing the air to be admitted in

great quantities just as the coal is 
thrown into the furnace. Prof. Trinks 
then spoke of mechanical stokers and 
recommended them very highly as 
good smoke preventers when rightly 
adjusted.
In speaking of systems, he men­
tioned that of Hamburg as being 
the most nearly ideal of any to the 
best of his knowledge. In this sys­
tem an inspector, who is an engineer, 
and two assistants are hired by a 
society for the prevention of smoke 
and for good furnace operationT These 
men are paid by the furnace and 
boiler owners, and make complete 
tests with scientific instruments and 
methods to obtain the best results.
Prof. Trinks recommended this sys­
tem as being the best for Pittsburg, 
and in closing made a slight reference 
to the government fuel testing plant 
which ft is desired to have located at 
Pittsburg. ______0______

Dear Aunt Hannah:
I was daubed up with shoe polish 
and oily soot on Saturday. I managed 
to wash off the polish but the grease 
still sticks. Please tell me how to 
remove it in your next issue, as the 
dirt is very noticeable when I wear 
my dark suit.—Silvernail.

FRATERNITIES.
The following article taken from the 
Rose Technic may be of interest to our 
readers in as much as it explains a (be­
fore and after taking) estimate of 
fraternities.
“With the advent of another fra­
ternity at Rose during the past month, 
this phase of our school activity seems 
to be worthy of some thought.
In 1891, when there were no fra­
ternities at Rose, the editor of The 
Technic saw fit to write the following:
“Purdue, Butler, Franklin, Hanover. 
De Pauro, Indiana University and 
Wabash each possess one phase of col­
lege life unknown to us, in the char­
acter of factional strife constantly main­
tained and aggravated by Greek letter 
fraternities. In their undertakings, 
literary, social, or athletic, the influence 
of this evil, as we term it, is felt. In 
the selection of representatives for, 
oratorical contests, in class elections, 
in arrangements for social pleasures, 
and the organization of baseball and 
football teams, it invariably enters to 
the detriment of all best interests. 
Casual observances by our ball men 
while on their several trips makes, it 
evident that we have an advantage in 
being free from Greek letter influence. 
Our students work as one body for the 
success of their projects, allowing no 
factional issue to enter as a germ of 
annihilation, while elsewhere fraternity 
supremacy is the first element to be 
considered and the success of an under­
taking secon.d.
Now, sixteen years from the date of
the above, there are six fraternities at 
Rose, and they have been conducted in 
such a way that the forebodings of the 
editor do not seem to have been justi­
fied. but his view of the matter is 
quoted, as it contains one of the most 
legitimate objections against this kind 
of organization.
The college fraternity, when rightly 
conducted, is an efficient instrument for 
the fostering of close personal friend­
ship, for the teaching of a charitable 
attitude toward the weaknesses of 
others and for the development of the 
fraternal feeling toward one’s neigh­
bors. When the activities of a frater­
nity are confined to these, its legitimate 
lines, as an organization it hardly 
seems open to criticism. The fact of 
the existence of an organization, how­
ever, makes a fraternity peculiarly fitted 
for use as a political tool, and under 
the leadership of an energetic and am­
bitious man or set of men, an active 
and consolidated minority may practi­
cally control class and school politics. 
I11 fact, we believe that it is not infre­
quent in some of the larger colleges 
for the various fraternities to divide the 
posts of honor, as far as they may be 
controlled by election, among them­
selves, to the exclusion of non-frater­
nity men. This kind of fraternity ac­
tivity is mischievous and to be con­
demned.
In looking over the names of the 
men who have been officers of our va­
rious organizations for the current 
year \we find that fraternity men are 
holding about 55 per cent, of these posi­
tions of responsibility, while all the fra­
ternity together include only about 3^ 
per cent, of the students in the school. 
This is probably to be largely explained 
by the natural desire of fraternities to 
count the school leaders among their 
members^-but whether this is the whole 
explanation or not,“it becomes the duty 
of those fraternity men who are in of­
fice to conduct the affairs of their re­
spective organizations so actively and 
wisely that no one will doubt that they 
obtained the offices because of their 
special qualifications for them and not 
because of membership in a fraternity. 
In the election of officers of a society 
the best man for the place should be 
sought for, regardless of fraternity af­
filiations or lack of affiliations, and any 
departure from this rule places upon 
the elected person the obligation of 
filling the position as well as the best 
man might have filled it.

PROM. NOTES.
Someone is reported to have asked 
Miss Connors to the Prom, but she 
actually had the nerve to turn him down.
We expect that Barber and Thurston 
had a close race for the honor of being 
home latest in the morning. Garber’s 
time was 5:27 and Thurston’s was 5:31.
Maggie Murphy was well represented 
at the Prom, but there still remained a 
few who might have but didn’t.
It’s a pity that such a good looking 
fellow as “Dicky” Bryce should go alone. 
He said he didn’t know any girls.
One Junior was heard to remark on 
Monday morning, “I wish we could have 
another one next month.”

THE PROFESSIONAL IDEALS OF 
THE TWENTIETH CENTRY.
(Continued from page 1.)
and inspires us with hope for the fu­
ture, is the story of the men who did 
the things—their struggles and their 
discoveries, their trials and their suc­
cesses.
The men who did more than any­
thing else to make the nineteenth 
century different from the other cen­
turies that went before it were its 
engineers. Down to the close of the 
eighteenth century the thinking of 
the country was dominated by its 
theologians, its jurists, and its phy­
sicians. These were by tradition the 
learned professions; the callings in 
which profound thought was needed; 
the occupations where successful men 
were venerated for their brains. It 
was reserved for the nineteenth cen­
tury to recognize the dominance of 
abstract thought in a new field—the 
field of constructive effort—and to re­
vere the trained scientific expert for 
what he had done in these lines. En­
gineering which a hundred years ago 
was but a subordinate branch of the 
military art, has become in the years 
which have since elapsed, a dominant 
factor 'in the intelligent practice of 
every art where power is to be ap­
plied with economy and intelligence.
A building like this is therefore the 
symbol of all that is most distinctive 
in the thought of the century that has 
gone by. A hundred years ago we 
might have had a building in honor 
of theologians or of lawyers or of 
physicians; but one that symbolized 
the achievements of the engineer was 
beyond man’s dreams, because the 
world at large had neither felt, the 
need of his work, nor dreamed how 
soon it would be seeking his leader­
ship. .
I have spoken of this building as a 
monument; but that is after all not 
the proper word. A monument im­
plies that a man is dead, or at any- 
rate that he has so nearly reached 
the limit of his growth that he might
just as well be dead. Looked at in 
this way, the engineering profession 
wants no monument. It has not yet 
reached the limit of its growth. It 
has not come to the time when a 
complacent survey of the past will 
take the place of the toilsome plan­
ning for the future. Not a headstone 
do we want, but a milestone—a point 
at which our measurement of what 
has been already done, serves as an 
inspiration for the journey yet to be 
traversed. We may take this oppor­
tunity for a brief review of what has 
been done in engineering and other 
allied professions; but the engineer 
who is worthy of his calling will value 
that review most highly, if it is made 
a means of calling his attention to 
that which yet remains to be done.
A hundred years ago there was a 
sharp separation ‘-between scientific 
theory and commercial practice. 
There was not a great deal of science 
anyway, outside of mathematics and 
astronomy; and what there was, was 
underrated by men of affairs. In those 
days when a man said he was prac­
tical it meant that he was not theo­
retical; that he didn’t know science, 
and didn’t want to know it, and didn’t 
want to have any man around that 
did know it. The men of that day 
trusted to two guides; inherited prej­
udice, and individual experience. The 
more enlightened among them used 
experience to correct prejudice; the 
rank and file of them used experience 
to reinforce prejudice; and that was 
about all the difference. The value 
of generalizations, except in religion 
and in statecraft, and in some few 
branches of medicine, was not rec­
ognized by anybody.
The great element of progress in 
the nineteenth century has been the 
recognition on the part of mankind 
in general, of the value of scientific 
generalizations in every department 
of human conduct. Our science has 
lecome sounder, our understanding 
of its applications clearer, and the 
public has recognized that scientific 
conduct of a business means the suo- 
stitution of universal experience.

learned with difficulty and applied 
with toil, for the narrower range of 
individual experience which was at 
the disposal of the so-called practical 
men of fifty or a hundred years ago. 
Of this change the engineer is the 
representative and the leader. He it 
is that makes physical science in its 
various lines applicable to the com­
plex problems of construction and de­
velopment. He it is who has paved 
the way for the recognition of the 
technologist, and the expert in every 
line of human industry. He it is who 
has shown how mathematics, instead 
of being an abstract discipline, remote 
from everyday human affairs may be­
come the means of applying truths for 
a long time remote and undiscovered, 
to the everyday affairs of the world 
in which we live. Not the buildings 
that you have built, gentlemen; not 
the railroads that you have planned; 
not the machines that you have in­
vented, represent your greatest 
achievement. Yours is the proud 
boast of having in one brief century 
established science as the arbiter of 
the material affairs of mankind, and 
of having enforced her worship upon 
a world once reluctant, but now glo­
riously admiring. * * * *

pleted for a dance to be given in the 
new school on the twenty-first of June 
by the students of the Margaret Mor­
rison School.
All girls are requested to see Miss 
Smith about the course they have de­

party held in the Commons last 
Wednesday. Every one was in good 
spirits for quite a while, but the lark 
did not have quite such a happy end­
ing.
Although we did not have the 
pleasure of a trip to the mines, we 
heard quite an interesting account of 
the day’s happenings instead of strug­
gling with angles. We also saw some 
of the coal, accidentally brought home.
One of our beloved faculty left us 
in the lurch on Friday afternoon. We 
watched her start on her walk, with 
longing eyes, but this did not help 
much.

W. U. P. VS. TECH.
The Carnegie Technical School’s 
track team will make her bow next 
Saturday when the dual meet with 
the Western University of Pennsyl­
vania takes place. The men have 
been training hard, and although they 
have been handicapped somewhat by 
the lack of a fit place to practice, the 
team may be relied upon to give a 
good account of itself.
Current reports have it that the 
W. U. P. camp boasts that Tech will 
not carry away a first place, yet 
judging from the time made in the 
W. U. P. vs. W. & J., we should take 
nearly every event. It is necessary 
that every Tech man should present 
himself at the park ready to support 
his team with Tech cheers until the 
last man in the last race has crossed 
the tape; and if the boys receive this 
necessary support from the school 
Tech will be a winner. The entries:
100-yard—Urling, Dowling, Werner, 
Silvernail.
220-yard—Urling, Dowling, Charles, 
Werner, Silvernail.
440-yard—Dowling, Bell, Charles, 
Silvernail.
880-yard—Beeken, Brown, Knight.
Mile—Thomson, Hudson, Brown, 
Beeken, Knight.
120-yard hurdle—Dowling, Dornber- 
ger.
220-yard hurdle—Urling, Dowling, 
Dornberger.
Hammer—Urling, Sprengle, Kohler.
Shot—Urling, Sprengle, Kohler.
Discus—Urling, Sprengle, Williams.
High jump—Griffith, Hatch.
Broad jump—Griffith, Hatch, Urling.
