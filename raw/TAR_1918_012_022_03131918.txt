HOME CONCERT 
MUSIC HALL 
THURSDAY-MAR. 21
The Carnegie Reserve Officers’ 
Training College was formally inau­
gurated last Monday morning at the 
first Military Assembly of Tech stu­
dents in Carnegie Music Hall. The 
Assembly was held iu honor of Colonel 
John C. W. Brooks, who has been sent 
by the government to supervise the 
R. 0. T. C. activities at C. I. T.
^.In the first address of the day, Presi­
dent Hamerschlag, who was the chair­
man of the assembly, warmly welcom­
ed Colonel Brooks and offered him the 
hearty co-operation of the students 
and the institute authorities during 
his presence at Tech.
Colonel Brooks was hindered in his 
response by a very sore throat, which 
forced him to abbreviate his address. 
He expressed his deep appreciation of 
the welcome accorded him on his ar­
rival in Pittsburgh. The colonel urged 
that all present should exert their 
utmost effort in defeating the purpose 
of the German spy system that is en­
meshing the country, and lauded the 
wonderful American unity that the 
war has effected.
Major Hillard Lyle, the command­
ant ot the student military forces at 
Tech, spoke next and described the 
advantages afforded by an R. O. T. C. 
to the students within its scope, and 
dwelt upon the ideals that guide the 
institute authorities and the military 
officials who supervise the training 
college.
The principal address of the morn­
ing was delivered by Captain Ray­
mond Thibaud, of the French Artil­
lery, who has come to this country 
on furlough, as a member of the 
French Military Mission. Captain Thi­
baud has seen service at the Marne, 
Verdun, Yser, the Aisne, and in other 
important engagements of this war. 
He spoke of the service that the 
French government has rendered the 
Allies, of the industries that are be­
ing promoted in France, and of the

GUESTS RAILROADED 
THROUGH MELLON HALL
Mellon Hall was transformed into a 
railroad station Saturday evening to 
furnish a novel setting for an informal 
house dance. After wraps and bag­
gage were checked, the evening was 
auspiciously started by a grand march 
led by Miss Charlotte Miller and Lew 
Welch. In the course of the evening 
a Quick Lunch was provided for the 
weary travelers. In spite of the 
weather, the girls heralded the advent 
of spring by appearing in light sum­
mer dresses. The attendance was 
ample and pleasing, including Marie 
Sommer and Callie Hunter, represent­
atives from ForbeS Hall and Fifth 
Avenue Hall. Hans Muller furnished 
the music for dancing.
In keeping with the setting, the role 
of ticket-chopper "was admirably filled 
by Miss Grace Rupert. For one of the 
“specials,” she furnished the girls 
with passes to various states. The 
men obtained tickets to the capital 
cities and those who remembered their 
geography had no difficulty in finding 
the state in which he belonged and 
dancing with the holder of the ticket.
The plan in operation is to have 
every girl in the dormitory active on 
one house entertainment committee 
during the year. Three more social 
events are scheduled for the remainder 
of the school year and the success of 
this one as an experiment augurs well 
for those to come. The committee in 
charge consisted of Anna Benscoter, 
chairman, assisted by Grace Rupert, 
Lulu Fuller, Helen Hollman, Isabella 
Greenberger, Blanche Morey, Virginia 
Stark, Ruth Quick and Mabel Aler- 
ander.
GIRLS NOMINATE FOR 
QUEEN OF THE MAY
After a long winter's rest the Mar­
garet Morrison Atheltic Association is 
showing signs of life. At a.meeting on 
Thursday, plans were discussed for a 
May-Day Festival, to take place on the 
lawn of Mellon Hall. During the meet­
ing, several girls were nominated for 
the character of May Queen. Miss 
Florence Bechtel, president of the Stu­
dent Senate; Miss Ida Richter, presi-

COL. BROOKS IS TRUE 
TYPE OF MILITARY MAN
Tech has been indeed fortunate in 
having Colonel John C. Brooks as the 
head of the military department. 
Colonel Brooks is inherently a mili­
tary man. His family has been excep­
tionally active in military work. His 
father was an admiral in the 
United States Navy during 
the Civil War, during which he 
fought under Admiral Farragut. Ad­
miral Brooks was present at the cap­
ture of Mobile, New Orleans and 
Vicksburg, and fought in many other 
important naval engagements.
The Colonel's uncle, on his mother’s 
side, was kiljed in action in the Mex­
ican War. And on both sides, Colonel 
Brooks’ ancestors fought in the Revo­
lutionary War. 1-Ie has a brother on 
the fighting line in France, a Captain 
in the Engineers.
The Colonel himself fought in the 
Spanish-American War and in the 
Philippine Insurrection. He graduat­
ed from West Point in 1885, having 
been sent there to represent the Erie 
district,¿Pennsylvania. Colonel Brooks 
is therefore, a representation of Penn­
sylvania in the army.
The Colonel stated that he was 
agreeably surprised and impressed by 
the advancement already accomplish­
ed at Tech under Major Lyle. He said 
that the aptitude and energy shown 
by the students, would, if continued, 
insure the success of the course.
M.M. FACULTY ENTERTAIN 
IN HONOR OF R. 0. T. C.
On Friday afternoon, March, 8, from
4 to 6 o’clock the dean and members 
of the Margaret Morrison faculty en­
tertained in honor of the Reserve 
Officers’ Training College with tea 
and dance in Recreation Hall. Guests 
included the faculty of the Institute 
and their wives. Among the guests 
of lionor were Col. John F. C. Brooks, 
Maj. Hilliard Lyle, Capt. and Mrs. H. 
Huston, and a group of lieutenants. In 
the receiving line were Mrs. A. A. 
Hamerschlag, Dean Mary Bidwell 
Breed, Mrs. Irene Farnham Conrad, 
Mrs. W. Freeman Galpin, Mrs. Adah 
Hopkins Aimie, Mrs. Eva L. Salisbury 
and Mrs. Charles Watkins. The affair 
was planned by the committee on pub­
lic occasions which consists of Mrs. 
Elizabeth Vermoicken, chairman; 
Miss Kate Gordon, Miss Elizabeth 
Demarest, Miss Clara Shaw, Miss 
Alice Hyde, Miss Theodora Briggs, 
Miss Ethel Ernst, Miss Honora Eng­
lish, Ira Gerard, W. Freeman Galpin, 
and Harold Lang.
MR. LA MARCA
Mr. N. E. La Marca, the director of 
the Glee Club, was born in Scanno, 
Province Aquila, Italy, on March 20, 
1891. He came to ! New York at the 
age of eleven, and obtained his edu­
cation in various schools in this coun­
try. After studying the language of 
the United States for several years, 
Mr. La Marca began the study of ad­
vanced music under the tutorship of 
C. R. Newman of Pittsburgh. While 
studying under Mr. Newman, Mr. La 
Marca was soloist in the Bellefield 
Presbyterian Church of our own dis­
trict. He then was engaged as tenor 
soloist in the Emanuel Episcopal 
Church until just recently, when, he 
transferred to the Methodist Protest­
ant Church in the East End.
In addition to his choral and solo 
work, Mr. La Marca has appeared in 
numerous operas and oratorios 
throughout the country. The following 
are some of the clippings taken from 
places where he has appeared: 
Cumberland (Md) News, “Mr. La 
Marca, a young Pittsburgh tenor, 
makes a distinct hit as tenor soloist 
at the Maryland Theatre.”
Mechanicsburg (Ohio) News, “Mr. 
La Marca is the owner of a most dra­
matic voice and uses it In a very skill­
ful manner.”
Mr. La Marca will sing "La donna 
e Mobile,” from Rigoletto at the Home 
Concert. His rich dramatic voice, 
coupled with his splendid personality, 
has won many friends for him in the 
numerous operas, oratorios and re­
citals in which he has participated 
throughout the country. It will pay 
you to hear him, so come to the 
Home Concert on the twenty-first.
It. is most gratifying to the manage-« 
ment of the Musical Clubs to know 
that the time Is near at hand whon 
the clubs will again appear beforo the 
Pittsburgh public and the Tech stu­
dent body, in their thirteenth annual 
Home Concert in the Carnegie Music 
I-Iall, and will entertain at their an­
nual dance in the Hotel Schenley, on 
Thursday evening, March 21, 1918.
This function is of such a nature, 
though foreign to Plebes and new­
comers at Tech, it has developed into 
an event long looked for from the 
early days of the school year. Not 
only do the upper classmen and 
friends who have graced the Music 
I-Iall by their presence in previous 
years look forward to this evening, 
but the incoming Plebes, who are 
seeking the traditions of their Alma 
Mater, glean the vaoious periodicals 
and handbooks for information of the 
big Musical Club’s event of the year.
The clubs, from every point of view, 
have developed materially since the 
initial tryouts in October. The suc­
cess has been due to the painstaking 
and untiring effort of the two Direc­
tors, Mr. La Marca and Signor Scalzo. 
These men this year have produced a 
program for the Home Concert that 
could replace the offering of any other 
large combined musical club in the 
country. Many times have the mem­
bers been changed and re-changed so 
that the whole would co-ordinate with 
the exceptional ideas of the Directors 
on Concert work.
The officers of the musical clubs 
are:
J. F. Sweeney, President.
R. W. Cost, Vice President.
F. A. Faville, Manager.
O. M. Olsen, Assistant Manager.
G. Ellerton, Jr., Publicity Manager.
C. L. Yost, Stage Manager.
T. R. Hinckley, Librarian of the 
Glee Club.

WELCOME IS EXTENDED 
TO MANY ENLISTED MEN
At a meeting of the enlisted men 
at Tech last Saturday night In the 
Union, a warm greeting was extended 
to all men taking war courses at 
Tech. This meeting was the first of 
a series to be held for the enlisted 
men In which “movies” and short ad­
dresses will be Included.
At last Saturday’s meeting, H. A. 
McConaughey, recently from Russia, 
spoke to the men. Colonel Samuel II. 
gliurch, chairman of the Board of 
Trustees, also addressed the men.
Prof. Richard Knotts sang several 
solos and led the patriotic singing. 
Dean Bossange extended to the sol­
diers the use of the Union for recrea­
tion.
RED CROSS BECOMING 
EVEN MORE ACTIVE
At a special Red Cross Assembly at 
M. M. C. S., on Friday, the 8th, Doan 
Breed spoke concerning the present 
situation of tho war. She told of the 
German conquest of Russia, and of tho 
critical and dangerous condition of 
Japan.
Mrs. Hamerschlag, chairman of the 
Tech Red Cross Auxiliary, spoko of 
the reorganization of the Auxiliary, 
and of a plan to havo every girl In tho 
school do Rod Cross work at definite 
hours and days each week.
Lieut. McKelvey, director of tho 
Women's Work of the Pittsburgh 
Chapter of the American Red Cross 
made an appeal to tho girls to do their 
best to keep tho war on tho other side, 
and told a little of the great work that 
the Red Cross is doing. The member­
ship in Allegheny County has grown 
in one and one-half years from 300 to
300,000. She explained that great dif­
ficulty is encountered in adapting 
American standards to the work in 
Europe. For this reason directions 
have to be changed, to fit our work to 
European needs.
Lieut. McKelvey strongly urged the 
girls to stop the criticism of the Red 
Cross, which is part of the German 
propaganda, and to go to those in 
authority with criticism. In ending 
her talk, Lieut. McKelvey read a poem 
which expressed the thought of her 
entire talk. Its thought was: Are
you satisfied to be doing your bit, 
while others are doing their all?
EIGHTH ANNUAL DANCE 
TO FOLLOW CONCERT
Thursday evening, March 21, will be 
the date of the Eighth Annual Dance 
of the Carnegie Musical Clubs at the 
Hotel Schenley. Every year the stu­
dent body looks forward to this dance 
after the concert, as it. is tho only 
formal dance to which the entire stu­
dent body is eligible. Any person pur­
chasing two $1.50 or two $1.00 lickets 
for the Home Concert Is entitled to at­
tend the dance, by payment of an ad­
ditional dollar. Dance Lickets must be 
procured at the Rox Office, which will 
be located In the Carnegie Union, on 
the third iloor of the Central Building, 
when - the exchange tickets are 
changed for reserved scats. Only one 
hundred and fifty dance tickets will 
be sold. The music, an orchestra of 
five pieces, will include some ot the 
best local players obtainable and will 
be under the supervision of Signor 
Scalzo.
Tech defeated Pitt 39 to 37 Friday 
night. In one of the most thrilling 
and best played games ever staged in 
the Tech Gymn, our team by sheer grit 
and light outplayed their heavier op­
ponents in every way. The game was 
hard fought from start to finish and at 
the end of the regular periods, the 
score was tied and it required an ad­
ditional four minutes of play to de­
cide the contest.
Tech made a good start in the first 
half. A couple of field goals and sev­
eral fouls shot by Doherty gave them 
a slight lead which they gradually in­
creased until at the end of the half 
the score stood at 24-14 in favor of 
Tech.
The team came back with fight ifiid 
determination in the second half; but 
their lightness and the lack of ade­
quate training conditions enabled 
their huskier opponents to slowly 
crawl up and then to lead them by 
two points, with but ono minute of 
playing time remaining. At this point 
the entire team braced and fought 
with their last ounce of strength. It. 
somod that fato was against them for 
shots rolled around tho edge of the 
basket only to drop put. With but a 
few seconds of time remaining Iloban 
tossed a pretty basket through tho 
hoop which tied tho score. The whis­
tle blow Immediately, the scoro stand- 
lug at. 36*80.
Both teams oxortod thomselvos to 
the utmost in tho extra period, but 
neither was able to cage the ball from 
the lloor. Ponman shot ono foul for 
Pitt but Jimmy Doherty hold his norvo 
and shot threo fouls under these most 
strenuous circumstances. Tho final 
scoro was thus 3!) to 37 in favor of 
Toch.
So woll did tho entlro toam play 
that It Is hardly fair to omit commend­
ing any of the men. Captain Grotz- 
lor was all over the floor, guarding and 
passing. lie also shot one Hold goal. 
Jimmy Doherty exhibited his usual

SENIOR CLASS BANQUET 
WILL BE HELD MABCH 23
Homo talont will be tho main foa- 
luro of the Class Banquet of tho Sci­
ence SonlorS. It Is slated for the 
twenty-third at the Colonial Annox 
Hotel, 7 p. m. The C. A. II. Is at Sixth 
(Foderal) street and Porin avenue.
All former members of the Illus­
trious Class tire eligible and are 
urged to attend, but they must get 
their names and consideration to W. 
V. Wolfo, Eaton, Pugh, or Arnold be­
foro the twenty-first, for, like good 
engineers, we are going to bo exact 
and there will be no standing room.
All seniors are drafted for this oc­
casion—110 exemptions or alibis—not 
even for speakers. And by the way— 
the single guest is coming for the pur­
pose of playing the piano. All other 
entertainment must come from the 
’18ers, for the hotel assures us that 
It cannot countenance any Oriental 
dancers, Hulas, Sirens or even cabaret 
intermissions. Other vaudeville in 
these days is insipid.
Incidentally, the menu is around the 
H grade in class. Other details will 
appear later.
AN ORDNANCE COURSE 
WILL BE GIVEN AT TECH
Another war course will soon be 
added to those now being given at 
Carnegie Tech. It is to provide special 
training for Engineers of Test and is 
to be under the superivslon of the Ord­
nance Department at Washington.
There will be from twenty to thir­
ty men in the first group to be sent 
here. No chemists will be included in 
this group, which will consist entirely 
of men who are to receive training 
as Engineers of Test. These will re­
port ror training to Lieutenant I. T. 
Hook In Carnegie Union Monday 
morning, March 18. They will bo col­
lege trained men, and tho work given 
them will bo plannod on a six weeks’ 
basis. The experience gained In 
training these men will be used as a 
foundation for training subsequent 
groups.
The object of this work is to give 
special technical training to men who 
are to represent the government in

TO AVOID MISUNDERSTANDING
It lias come to our attention that the editorial in last week’s 
Tartan suggesting a student officers’ conference might be badly mis­
construed, especially by one who is not familiar with the work at 
Tech. Doubtless the suggestion which that editorial contained should 
have been made in person to the Commandant and not through the 
medium of the paper; but since it has already been published, it is 
up to us to see that it is not misunderstood.
Briefly, the article suggested a student officers’ conference, and 
cited instances which seemed to form valid reasons for the holding of 
such a conference. Those reasons were of necessity criticisms, and 
of that criticism wc want to say the following things: First, while 
it is always presumptuous to criticize a superior of any sort, and more 
than presumptuous in a military organization, still this criticism of 
student officers was meant to be helpful; wherever it has appeared as 
destructive criticism to anyone, wc are sorry and assure him it was 
not intended so. Second, in no ease was there intended any criticism 
of the military authorities themselves, and no single word of the ar­
ticle was meant to refer to them except where names were definitely 
mentioned.
It has been suggested that the article in question was fault-find­
ing; it dealt with the defects in a new organization without mention­
ing the many things which serve to more than balance the other side 
of the ledger. There is no dissention in the student body. There is 
probably no other school in the country which has accomplished so 
much whore there was so little to start with. If The-Tartan failed 
to mention these results, it was only because we thought that our 
attitude on the matter was too well understood to be misconstrued, 
especially after the excitement which was raised earlier in the year 
by our consistent support of physical training and military training 
at Tech.
SUMMER ORDERS FOR ENLISTED ENGINEERING STUDENTS
Many oil! the Mngineering students who are enlisted in the Engi­
neers ’ Reserve Corps have made inquiries concerning what is to be 
expected of them during the summer period. The administration has 
taken up the matter with the Office of the Chief of Engineers, War 
[Department, and has been informed that students enlisted in the 
Engineer Enlisted llcsclve Corps arc required to submit a monthly 
report during the summer months, that this is the only tiling that is 
required ot' them by the Office of the Chief of Engineers.

DESIGN PLEBES HOSTS 
AT FIRST MILITARY BALL
The Design Plebes entertained their 
friends, the upperclassmen, in the De­
sign Foyer last Friday. The occasion 
was the first Military Ball ever given 
at Tech. Dancing started at about 
ten; at eleven during the intermis­
sion, Stotz and Perkins produced sev­
eral clever stunts. Perkins surprised 
everyone by displaying talent hereto­
fore concealed.
Dancing was resumed at twelve. 
The Foyer was decorated with flags, 
to carry out the military atmosphere 
and most of the men were in uniform. 
Riehl’s orchestra furnished the music. 
The whole Design Plebe class are to 
be congratulated upon the success of 
the First Military Ball, and the com­
mittee deserve special mention. The 
committee consisted of Miss Bralim, 
Miss Ferguson, Miss Liebert, Miss 
Hood, Mr. Pergins and Mr. Dircks.

NORTHFIELD PROGRAM
At the Y. W. C. A. meeting held 
Thursday evening, March 7, in the 
M. M. C. S. recreation hall, “Cliff” 
Barbour, secretary of Pitt Y. M. C. A., 
outlined the Northfield program. 1-Ie 
told of the inauguration of this plan 
at a conference held at Northfield, 
January 3 and 4, by 200,000 students 
of the United States and Canada, for 
the purpose of engaging in the consid­
eration of Christian ideals in regard 
to the world war. Since that assem­
bly, many schools have more than 95 
per cent of their student bodies en­
gaged in some form of Bible study. 
Mount Holyoke has every girl enlisted 
in this work. Pitt has every frater-

nity but one giving one night each 
week to supervised Bible study. Mr. 
Barbour suggested the following sub­
jects for study. The Life of Christ; 
2. Christian ideals as related to the 
world war; 3. Christian ideals as fac­
tors in democracy. What will Tech 
do with this program? Mrs. Ham er­
schlag. was an honor guest of the As­
sociation. She very briefly told of 
the plans being formulated to carry 
on Red Cross work more effectively.
Miss Browning will be in charge of 
the Y. W. C. A. meeting next week. 
Dr. Lowe will tell of his experience 
as a missionary in Africa.

parts p:ayed by the different allied 
nations in this war. He also describ­
ed the wonderful work undertaken by 
America since her entrance into the 
war and related conditions at Camp 
Upton, Long Island, where he has 
been engaged in jvork concerning the 
War Mission.
“Our Red Cross Unit” was describ­
ed by Mrs. Hamerschlag, who spoke 
of the work done by the organization. 
The Red Cross is to give a dance in 
the near future and Mrs. Hamerschlag, 
who is at the head of the unit, urged 
that everyone connected in any way 
with Carnegie Tech give his best ef­
fort toward the suecess of the affair.
A very pleasing solo, “When the 
Boys Come Home,” was sung by Miss 
Anna Laura Johnston Cree, a well- 
known Pittsburgh soprano. The song 
was very appropriate and was receiv­
ed with marked appreciation by the 
audience. .
The khaki-clad students presented 
an inspiring sight when they marched 
to the hall, with the student band, led 
by Mr. Sullivan, at the head of the 
line, which contained also the enlisted 
men, who are taking the intensive 
courses at Tech. Music was furnish­
ed by the band during the program.
An odd coincidence occurred during 
the meeting. The audience sang “Keep 
the Home Fires Burning,” under thn 
leadership of Mr. Robert J. McDowell, 
who asked for the repetition of the 
chorus several times. Those present 
shared Mr. McDowell’s spirit and re­
sponded with enthusiasm. That after­
noon news was published of the death 
of Mrs. Ford, the author of the song, 
who was killed, with her son, during 
a bombardment of a town in France.
(Continued From Page One.) 
high standard of playing and kept Mc­
Laren trailing after him at all times. 
He shot three Held goals and twenty- 
three out of twenty-eight attempts at 
foul goals. His exhibition on the foul 
line in the extra period was as line a 
piece of work as has ever been seen 
in the Tech Gymn. I-Ioban played a 
brilliant tloor game and also caged two 
field goals, 0110 of which tied the 
score in the last few seconds of play. 
Cosgrove shot two field goals and 
played a fast guarding game, as did 
Wire.
For Pitt Levine starred, shooting 
five field goals and covering the floor 
nicely. Robinson at center for the 
Panthers also played a nice game. but. 
more than met his match in Gretzler.
The game is an excellent example of 
the manner in which the proper kind 
of support can bolster up the lighting 
spirit and playing of a team, if the 
team had received this same support 
thruout the season, Some of the games 
might have been transferred from the 
lost to the won column.
The lineup:
Tech—39. Pitt—37.
Hoban ......................F.................... Penman

Substitutions—Leet for Wire, Wolf

23 out of 2S. Referee—Slack and C. 
Daugherty.
In the preliminary game before the 
Pitt-Tech Varsity fracas, the Pitt 
freshmen overwhelmed the Tech 
Plebes by the score of 54 to 25. So 
strong was the defense of the Panther 
Cubs that the Plebes did not have the 
opportunity to break through and 
manifest usual excellent team play. 
Kelly at forward for Pitt was the chief 
unsolvablo problem for the Plebes. 
This gentleman broke through time 
after time and dribbled up to the bas­
ket. and caged the spheroid with un­
erring accuracy.
Lot it. be said for the Plebes that 
they were minus the services of some 
of their best men, but nevertheless 
they havo not staged as poor an exhi­
bition previously during this season. 
Their usual well coordinated play was 
shown only on a few very widely 
scattered occasions.
Lynn played fairly well at center, 
but McCrory was so much larger than 
he, that Pitt had little trouble in get­
ting the tip off and putting 'their sig­
nals Into play. Hamman who played 
part of tlio game at forward was in no 
condition for the game, because of Ills 
shoulder which was badly Injured In 
the Penn Stato gamo.

A SUGGESTIONHave You Seen the Neiv Gillettes
Specially Designed for the Fighting Man?
rpHESE models were designed by members of tho 
-1 Gillette Organization who have seen service with' 
the Colors and know what the soldier is up against.
Hundreds of officers and men are buying them—the U. S. Service Set in metal case, and the new Khaki- 
covered sets for Uncle Sam's soldiers and officers.
The Gillette is the one razor for the man who is do­
ing things—the one razor with world-wide use and 
reputation.
When a man wants new Blades he can get them at 
any Post Exchange or Y. M. C. A. Hut — here in 
America or Overseas.
Our Paris Office carries stocks—is constantly sup­
plying the American' Expeditionary Forces. Gillette

Colonel Brooks made a statement 
Saturday which clear« up the uniform 
situation to a large extent. Dress uni­
forms will not be provided this semes­
ter. The government makes an ap­
propriation for each student’s uni­
form, but a certain kind of uniform 
must be provided and there is a good 
deal of red tape to be gone through 
with. Owing to the fact that the time 
before the summer vacation is so 
short it has been deemed wisest to 
wait until next fall to get the dress 
uniforms. At that time each student 
will have a cotton khaki suit for drill, 
and a serge dress uniform. Until then 
the only uniform worn will be the 
cotton khaki which the students now 
have. When trench digging begins, 
the men will wear overalls similar to 
those worn by the soldiers when work­
ing around machinery.
In all probability we shall soon be 
drilling with real rifles. Major Lyle 
was in New York several days last 
week, and he succeeded in placing a 
requisition with the War Department 
for both rifles and machine guns. 
Major Lyle had also intended to go 
to West Point for a few days in order 
to study the plan of organization in 
operation there, hut was forced to re­
turn to Pittsburgh by a severe attack 
of tonsilitis.
Colonel Brooks stated that ’ before 
long all the students of the institute 
will drill at the same hour. This is 
impossible just at present, as the stu­
dents need more individual attention 
than would then be possible, but just 
as soon as the students have become 
proficient enough all the companies 
will turn out for drill at the same 
hour. Colonel Brooks expressed him­
self as being quite satisfied with the 
progress being made by the students 
and said that they are doing even bet­
ter than he had expected.

On February 28 the night students, 
of the department of dramatic arts, 
School of Applied' Design, presented a 
triple bill, embracing K. S. Goodwin’s 
"Dancing Dolls,” Colin Clements' 
"Just Women,” and Zona Gales’ 
"Neighbors.” The theatre was filled 
with an enthusiastic and responsive 
audience.
“Dancing Dolls” has become part of 
the annual diet in this department, be­
ing a study in “tempo” and, hereto­
fore, it has always been the dullest 
of the dull, but this cast got under 
it and lifted it out of the mediocre, 
making it worthy of a place on the 
program of this department. Its suc­
cess was largely due to the very ex­
cellent .work of John C. Cox as 
“Gilles” who had the necessary 
“nerve” and got where he was going 
without loss of time or interest. His 
diction was notably good and his inter­
pretation spirited. Kenneth Thomp­
son made a properly gloomy “Maz- 
zetin” and Thomas McSteen gave a 
good account of himself as "Buffo.” 
Elizabeth Gordon’s "Clementina” was 
very amusing. Alma Lotz was inter­
esting as “Margot” and “Finetta” was 
very acceptably played by Catherine 
Lepper. John Hammond as the “Not­
ary” completed the cast.
As "Just Women” is to have anoth­
er performance it will be reviewed 
later with the other "Tech” plays, 
which will be on the same bill.
‘Neighbors" was the most finished 
performance on the evening’s bill, 
Taking all things into consideration, 
Miss Mae Sweeney’s "Miss Diantha 
Able” was a very clever characteriza­
tion which her former work has earn­
ed. Miss Blanche Levy’s "Miss El­
mira -Moran” was a very interesting 
interpretation of an entirely new role 
for Miss Levy. It’s success proves 
her versatility. Kenneth Thompsan as 
"Peter,” played a straight forward 
role, which made it one of the best 
things he has done.
Miss Marguerite Carnegie’s “Inez” 
was interesting because of itsinatural- 
ness.
Special mention should be made of 
the work of Miss Goldie Abrams as 
“Miss Trot,” Avliose great interest in 
life is the elimination of “Buffalo 
Bugs.”
Heretofore her work has been great­
ly hampered by faulty diction, but this 
performance demonstrated her ability 
to overcome the objectionable accent 
of which scarcely a vestige remains 
and gave her work the finish which 
her histrionic ability deserves.
Thomas White’s “Ezra,” was suffi­
ciently violent and brusque. Marietta 
Callahan as “Grandma” did what was 
possible with this doleful role.
Anne Cochrane_as “Miss Carrie Els- 
wortli” completed the cast and called 
out all the sympathy of the audience. 
The night students seem to have very 
promising material among their num­
bers.
