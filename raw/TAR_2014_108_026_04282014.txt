David A. Tepper returned 
to Carnegie Mellon last Thurs-
day to edify an audience on 
his vision for the new Tepper 
Quadrangle, answer questions 
about his business strategy 
and, at one point, sing a few 
bars from Elvis’s “Heartbreak 
Hotel”.
Tepper ?rst made his mark 
on Carnegie Mellon in 2003, 
when he donated $55 mil-
lion, after which the Graduate 
School of Industrial Adminis-
tration was renamed the Tep-
per School of Business. Last 
November, on the same day 
as President Subra Suresh’s 
inauguration, the university 
announced another donation 
from Tepper, this time of $67 
million.
Tepper’s most recent do-
nation will be used to expand 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus by 
building the four-and-a-half 
acre Tepper Quadrangle. The 
Tepper Quadrangle, Tepper 
said, will include a new space 
for the Tepper School of Busi-
ness and the Center for Inno-
vation and Entrepreneurship, 
formed by a marriage of the 
Tepper School of Business’s 
Donald H. Jones Center for 
Entrepreneurship and the 
School of Computer Science’s 
Project Olympus.
“The idea is to create some 
cross-disciplinary, synergistic 
places in the Tepper Quad-
rangle,” Dean of the Tepper 
School of Business Robert M. 
Dammon said when he intro-
duced Tepper in front of a full 
McConomy Auditorium.
Tepper, born and raised in 
Pittsburgh’s East End, stayed 
close to home for his educa-
tion, earning his undergradu-
ate degree in economics from 
the University of Pittsburgh in 
1978 and his MBA from Carn-
egie Mellon in 1982. 
After he graduated from 
Carnegie Mellon, Tepper 
worked for the treasury de-
partment of the Ohio-based 
Republic Steel. Tepper

Senate, GSA ratify 2014–15 JFC budget
RACHEL COHEN

Student Senate and the 
Graduate Student Assembly 
(GSA) held a joint meeting 
on Thursday to hear second-
round budget appeals and 
ratify the slate for total Joint 
Funding Committee (JFC) 
allocations for the 2014–15 
?scal year. Both bodies voted 
to approve a total $29,467 
increase in JFC allocations — 
an approximate 1.95 percent 
increase to the original $1.51 
million in allocations.
Student Body Vice Presi-
dent for Finance (SBVPF) 
and junior statistics major 
Jalen Poteat gave an intro-
ductory presentation, during 
which he urged senators and 
GSA members to be mindful 
of recent changes to the JFC 
metrics. Among these chang-
es was a ?at cap of $250 per 
person for travel. This year, 
the JFC also allocated more 
money to subsidize food for 
events where the food relates 
directly to the culture of that 
event.
Student Senate Chair and 
senior chemistry major Lukas 
Ronner led discussion in co-
ordination with Patrick Foley, 
GSA president and a doctoral 
candidate in statistics.
According to Poteat and 
Foley, the JFC allocations 
were typical relative to pre-
vious years and aligned with 
projections for JFC spend-
ing. “I don’t see any drastic 
departure from ordinary 
JFC spending from previous 
years,” Foley said.
A difference in next year’s 
allocations is a decrease in 
funding for Activities Board 
(AB) Concerts as compared 
to this year’s allocations. AB 
Concerts was granted more 
funding than usual this year 
in anticipation of the 100th 
Spring Carnival. 
The JFC approved 
$125,000 to cover artist 
booking fees for the spring 
concert — $25,000 more 
than the $100,000 originally 
requested, as compared to 
the $60,000 granted the year 
before. Next year, AB Con-
certs will receive $60,000 
of the $75,000 originally re-
quested for the annual Spring 
Carnival concert.
The JFC issued ?nal bud-
get recommendations last 
Monday and directed orga-
nizations who wished to fur-
ther appeal the JFC’s decision 
to make their case to both 
Student Senate and the GSA 
at Wednesday’s meeting.

round appeals process,

In 2013 alone, Carnegie 
Mellon launched a record 36 
startups which, combined, 
produce everything from 3-D 
printers, in the case of Piece-
Maker Technologies, to arti?-
cial heart valves, in the case of 
PECA Labs.
Recently SolePower, a 
company that makes electric-
ity-generating insoles, has 
been making headlines by 
earning a spot on Popular Sci-
ence’s 2014 Invention Awards 
List. The SolePower insole, 
according to the SolePower 
website, produces electricity 
when the wearer steps on it, 
and stores the energy in an 
external power pack.
SolePower was born when 
its co-founders, Carnegie Mel-
lon alumni Matt Stanton (CIT 
‘13) and Hahna Alexander 
(CIT ‘13), took inspiration for 
their senior mechanical engi-
neering capstone project from 
hand crank-powered ?ash-
lights. They wanted to make 
shoes that lit up when the user 
stepped on them, with the ini-
tial goal of making walking or 
running at night safer.
“After the class, Matt and 
Hahna saw greater potential 
for their product,” business 
developer for SolePower Da-
vit Davitian, a University of 
Pittsburgh graduate, said via 
email. “By storing generated 
power for later use, they could 
make a renewable, portable 
power source for various mo-
bile devices. As a hiker, Matt 
saw an immediate bene?t for 
outdoor enthusiasts. Both 
of them also recognized the 
great social bene?ts SolePow-
er can have for people living 
without access to electricity.”
According to Popular Sci-
ence’s article recognizing 
SolePower, “Instead of us-
ing piezoelectric and other 
inef?cient, bulky methods of 
generating electricity, [Stan-
ton and Alexander] shrunk 
down components similar 
to those found in hand-
cranked ?ashlights.”
Although the idea behind 
SolePower was a direct result 
of Stanton and Alexander’s 
classwork, the company grew 
with the help of Project Olym-
pus, an initiative of the School 
of Computer Science that fos-
ters student entrepreneurs.
Distinguished career pro-
fessor of computer science 
Lenore Blum founded Project 
Olympus in 2007 after seeing 
countless Carnegie Mellon 
students move to California 
when they graduated to work 
in Silicon Valley, rather than 
pursuing their own ideas as 
entrepreneurs.
“We produce the best tech-
nological resources on the 
planet, namely our students, 
and as soon as we produce 
them we export them every-
where but here,” Blum, who 
has worked at Carnegie Mel-
lon for close to 15 years, said 
in an interview about her in-
spiration for founding Project 
Olympus. “I could understand 
what’s going on — if you’re 
getting these great jobs, why 
even think of starting some-
thing yourself? That was the 
culture.”
Inspiration from Project 
Olympus also came from 
Blum’s work with Aladdin, a 
National Science Foundation-
funded institute for algorithm 
research. Aladdin researchers

Randi Zuckerberg spoke 
on campus about her role in 
the development of Facebook 
and the books and projects of 
Zuckerberg media, offering 
advice on how to obtain bal-
ance in a life surrounded by 
technology.
Held in McConomy audi-
torium last Tuesday, Zucker-
berg addressed an audience 
of around 60 attendees.
Randi Zuckerberg is the 
sister of Facebook founder 
Mark Zuckerberg, and is cur-
rently the CEO of Zuckerberg 
media and the editor-in-chief 
of Dot Complicated, an online 
community and newsletter.
Dot Complicated, as de-
scribed on their website, “is 
an online community aimed 
at ‘untangling’ our wired, 
wonderful lives.” The website 
aims to address shifting social 
conventions surrounding the 
use of communication tech-
nologies, addressing “how we 
interact with friends and fam-
ily, how we raise our children, 
how we announce major life 
news, how we ?nd love, and 
how we manage our careers.” 
In addition to having an on-
line community, the site also 
curates and sends a weekly 
newsletter to subscribers.
Zuckerberg was intro-
duced by AB Lectures chair 
and ?rst-year business admin-
istration major Narain Krish-
namurthy, who remarked, 
“having grown up in the In-
ternet revolution, we’re all 
familiar with the disruptive 
qualities of social media,” 
continuing, “whenever we see 
something funny or strange 
on campus, we want to post 
that to Overheard at CMU.”
Krishnamurthy introduced 
Zuckerberg, saying that she 
would talk about how “so-
cial media has changed the 
way we interact online and 
of?ine.”
Zuckerberg began her 
lecture with her background 
story. Zuckerberg studied at 
Harvard University as a psy-
chology and marketing ma-
jor, after not being accepted 
for music. After she gradu-
ated, Zuckerberg worked at 
Ogilvy & Mather advertising 
in New York. “I got staffed 
on a brand new team called 
digital interactive marketing,” 
Zuckerberg said. Although at 
?rst Zuckerberg had wanted a 
position in television advertis-
ing, she soon saw her depart-
ment grow to be one of the 
top divisions in the ?rm.
Soon after she started 
working, Zuckerberg began 
receiving calls from her broth-
er to join Facebook and assist 
with marketing. “I probably 
rejected him dozens of times,” 
Zuckerberg said.
“When I got to California, 
I was blown away,” she said, 
remarking on the employees 
“coding around the clock.” 
She said, “they had a passion 
for what they were building 
that I didn’t see in corporate 
America.” Zuckerberg was 
asked to choose the startup’s 
logo, a task which someone 
with years of experience 
would be performing at an 
established ?rm. “It was that 
moment I knew I had to be 
part of Facebook,” Zucker-
berg said.
While Zuckerberg was 
working at Facebook as their 
marketing director, she coor-
dinated their live stream of 
the 2008 presidential inau-
guration and developed the

Randi Zuckerberg, CEO of Zuckerberg Media, editor-in-chief of Dot 
Complicated, and sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, spoke 
about her role in the rise of Facebook and the growing role that social 
media is playing in our everyday lives.

The Carnegie Mellon 
University Computer Club 
— with help from The Andy 
Warhol Museum (AWM), 
Carnegie Mellon’s Frank 
Ratchye STUDIO for Cre-
ative Inquiry, the Hillman 
Photography Initiative at the 
Carnegie Museum of Art, and 
New York-based artist Cory 
Arcangel — recently found 
several previously undiscov-
ered works of art by alumnus 
Andy Warhol (CFA ‘49).
Warhol’s art had been 
stored digitally on Amiga 
?oppy disks, found in the ar-
chive collection of the AWM. 
Arcangel started the inves-
tigation into the disks after 
seeing a 1985 Commodore 
International infomercial 
that advertised an experi-
ment Warhol did, commis-
sioned by Commodore. 
Warhol’s work was meant to 
demonstrate the graphic de-
sign power of the Amiga 1000 
personal computer.
After ?nding the disks in 
the AWM’s archives, Arcangel 
worked with the Computer 
Club to read the outdated 
diskettes. The ?oppy disks — 
originally used for the com-
puter system and applica-
tions — contained ?les with 
promising names like “camp-
bells.pic” and “marilyn1.pic.” 
The format of the images, 
however, was unknown. 
When Computer Club mem-
bers reverse-engineered the 
format they revealed 28 new 
works by Warhol covering 
subjects from the well-known 
Campbell’s soup can to Botti-
celli’s Venus.
“What’s amazing is that by 
looking at these images, we 
can see how quickly Warhol 
seemed to intuit the essence 
of what it meant to express 
oneself, in what then was a 
brand-new medium: the digi-
tal,” Arcangel said in a uni-
versity press release.
The team’s process and 
?ndings are documented in 
the Hillman Photography 
Initiative’s “Trapped: Andy 
Warhol’s Amiga Experi-
ments,” which premieres Sat-
urday, May 10 at the Carn-
egie Library Lecture Hall in

Girls of Steel work with CMU Robotics
The Girls of Steel, a group 
of high-school girls from the 
Pittsburgh area, tested their 
mettle at the FIRST Robotics 
Competition Championship 
in St. Louis last week.
The Girls of Steel are al-
ready experienced, having 
helped members of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Robotics Institute 
to build the Autodesk ReCap 
Robot, which uses the 3-D 
design software Autodesk to 
create 3-D models.
Rachel Round, a home-
schooled senior from Har-
rison City, built the robot’s 
sheet-metal housing. “It 
was a unique experience,” 
Round said in a university 
press release. 
The robot the Girls of 
Steel created takes data from 
laser scanners to create a 3-D 
point cloud modeling an in-
terior space. For the FIRST 
competition, the Girls of 
Steel designed and built a ro-
bot to do a speci?c task; their 
robot catches and throws 24-
inch balls. The ReCap Robot 
was designed with help from 
Carnegie Mellon roboticists, 
who ensured that it met pro-
fessional standards.
“I knew CMU’s Robotics 
Institute did fantastic work,” 
said Aaron Morris, prod-
uct manager for Autodesk’s 
Reality Solutions Group, in 
a university press release. 
“That they were able to build 
this robot in only a month’s 
time, and make it audience-
safe, has only strengthened 
my appreciation for their ca-
pabilities.”

Student Senate and the 
Graduate Student Assembly 
(GSA) heard second round 
appeals from student organi-
zations before the rati?cation 
of the annual Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC) budget. 
Among those organizations 
appealing were Spring Car-
nival Committee, Carnegie 
Mellon Solar Splash, WRCT, 
Ballroom Dance Club, AB 
Concerts, and the University 
Rowing Club. Spring Carnival 
Committee received $10,500 
at the appeal for ?reworks, 
WRCT received $7,245 to 
transition to a digital au-
dio system, Ballroom Danc-
ing Club received $1,532 for 
their Scotch Ball event, and 
the University Rowing Club 
received $14,190 for a trailer. 
Carnegie Mellon Solar Splash 
and AB Concerts were denied 
their appeals.

Student Senate and the 
GSA discussed the allocation of 
$4,000 total to provide hono-
rariums of $2,000 per semester 
each for the student body vice 
president for ?nance and the 
student body vice president for 
organizations. After an appeal 
from Student Body President 
Elect and junior electrical and 
computer engineering and busi-
ness administration double ma-
jor Ian Glasner, the allocation 
was removed from the budget.
Approving the Slate
Student Senate and the 
GSA voted to approve the ?nal 
budget allocated in the JFC 
slate. The slate passed in both 
Student Senate and the GSA, 
?nalizing the JFC budget for 
the upcoming 2014–15 ?scal 
year.

---------------------------------------------------

presented to both bodies for 
one minute. This presenta-
tion was followed by a four-
minute discussion, then a 
voting process that was fre-
quently delayed by senators 
and GSA members as they ex-
tended the discussion period.
Among the groups whose 
funding requests were ap-
proved were Carnival Com-
mittee, WRCT, Ballroom 
Dance Club, and Rowing 
Club. While Ballroom Dance 
Club received a relatively 
small increase of $1,532 to 
fund their Scotch Ball event, 
other groups received ap-
proval for larger requested 
amounts.
Carnival Committee re-
ceived $10,500 to reinstate 
?reworks after next year’s 
Carnival concert. Campus 
radio station WRCT was 
granted $7,245 to facilitate 
its transition to a digital au-
dio system. Rowing Club re-
ceived $14,190 to purchase 
a new trailer; their old one 
broke down just last Saturday 
— too late for Rowing Club 
to make the request for ?rst-
round appeals.
Undergraduate solar-elec-
tric boat team Solar Splash 
and AB Concerts were both 
denied the increases they 
requested. 
Solar Splash requested 
$11,700 as operational 
funds for building its boat 
and hosting community 
events. AB Concerts request-
ed a $10,000 increase per 
semester — $20,000 total — 
to allow them to negotiate 
for artists with higher price 
ranges. They also requested 
$4,250 to fund a safer truck 
stage to upgrade from tradi-
tional stage setups. Student 
Senate and the GSA denied 
both requests.
Finally, Student Body 
President Elect and junior 
electrical and computer engi-
neering and business admin-
istration double major Ian 
Glasner appealed to retract a 
$4,000 allocation that would 
provide honorariums to the 
SBVPF and student body 
vice president for organiza-
tions (SBVPO), continuing a 
conversation within student 
government about offering 
honorariums to student gov-
ernment executives.
In light of recently de-
nied efforts to provide hono-
rariums to the student body 
president (SBP) and student 
body vice president (SBVP), 
Glasner also moved to elimi-
nate compensation for SBVPF 
and SBVPO. Despite his over-
all support for honorariums 
for student government ex-
ecutives, Glasner said, “Only 
paying SBVPF and SBVPO 
devalues the SBP and SBVP 
roles.”
The appeal passed in 
both governing bodies, and 
the $4,000 allocation was 
removed.
After voting individually 
on each appeal, Student Sen-
ate and the GSA voted one ?-
nal time to ratify the JFC slate 
for the coming ?scal year.

Tepper speaks about vision for Tepper Quad
Courtesy of the Tepper School of Business
Left: Tepper spoke about how he started his own company, Appaloosa Managment, after leaving Goldman Sachs in 1992. Right:  Tepper shook 
hands with Dean of the Tepper School of Business Robert M. Dammon at the end of his talk.
subsequently worked for 
Equibank and then Gold-
man Sachs, where, after be-
ing turned down for partner 
three times, he left to start 
his own business, Appaloosa 
Management.
During the talk, both un-
dergraduate and graduate 
students in the Tepper School 
of Business lined up on either 
side of the auditorium to ask 
Tepper about his life, busi-
ness sense, and the Tepper 
Quadrangle.
A graduate student opened 
the queue of questions by ask-
ing Tepper about the motiva-
tion behind his $67 million 
gift and his vision for the Tep-
per Quadrangle. “The ?rst gift 
was basically paying back the 
school; I had a great educa-
tion here,” Tepper said. “The 
second gift, I thought the 
school needed to be elevated 
a little bit. We need to move 
up in the rankings a little bit.” 
Tepper also mentioned that 
he wanted to see the Tepper 
School of Business be more 
integrated into the rest of the 
Carnegie Mellon community.
Another important part 
of the Tepper Quadrangle, 
Tepper said, will be new ath-
letic facilities. After seeing 
the university’s existing ath-
letic facilities earlier that day, 
Tepper noted that they “still 
suck.”
Another student asked 
Tepper what he considered 
the most valuable part of his 
education at Carnegie Mel-
lon. “The education gave me 
a great foundation, a great 
business knowledge,” Tepper 
said. “You come out of here, 
and you’re as prepared as 
anybody.”
Audience members also 
wanted to know what Tep-
per learned outside of school 
during his time at companies 
like Equibank and Goldman 
Sachs where, Tepper said, he 
became head trader in only a 
year. Tepper said the most im-
portant thing for students to 
learn is that they don’t know 
anything. “You’re no smarter 
than the market — when you 
become a good trader is when 
you realize how stupid you 
are.”
When someone asked him 
what he would have done if 
he hadn’t become a hedge 
fund manager, Tepper joked 
that he could do a pretty good 
Elvis impersonation, treat-
ing the audience to a verse of 
“Heartbreak Hotel”.
Tepper also spoke about 
some of his recent philan-
thropy efforts, including his 
work with Better Education 
for Kids, a political action 
group that Tepper co-founded 
to improve education in New 
Jersey.
One student asked Tepper 
if he ever considered signing 
the Giving Pledge, described 
on its website as “a commit-
ment by the world’s wealthi-
est individuals and families 
to dedicate the majority of 
their wealth to philanthropy.” 
The Giving Pledge has been 
signed by millionaires and bil-
lionaires ranging from Warren 
Buffett and Elon Musk to Bill 
and Melinda Gates.
Tepper remarked that he 
had been investing in philan-
thropy long before similarly 
well-known billionaires, and 
wasn’t planning on stopping. 
“I don’t need a pledge to give,” 
he said.
BUSINESS, from A1
Zuckerberg shares marketing lessons 
company’s U.S. elections and 
international politics strategy.
When she left Ogilvy & 
Mather, Zuckerberg recalled, 
“My boss told me I was cra-
zy, I was throwing away 
my career.”  She remarked 
that people who doubted her 
have since asked her for jobs.
At Facebook, Zuckerberg 
realized, “I had a front row 
seat on how social media was 
changing our life.”
“We took a demand-led 
marketing approach,” Zucker-
berg said about her marketing 
strategy at Facebook. Zucker-
berg opened the website one 
college at a time, and waited 
until there were people asking 
for access before spreading 
the site to other institutions.
After she told her story, 
Zuckerberg spoke about the 
culture surrounding technolo-
gy’s development and use. She 
lauded hackathons and spoke 
to how important they were to 
building Facebook’s “hacker, 
entrepreneur culture.”
It was from a company-
sponsored hackathon that 
Zuckerberg got the idea for 
Facebook Live, a video stream-
ing program which would 
attract celebrities and politi-
cians. The program took off 
after Katy Perry announced a 
world tour from the platform, 
and became so popular that 
Zuckerberg “actually got a 
call from the White House,” 
when Barack Obama wanted 
to livestream a town hall.
Zuckerberg left Facebook 
after running Facebook Live 
and founded Zuckerberg Me-
dia. The ?rm consults with 
other companies on the use 
of social media and technol-
ogy, and also develops their 
own publications, including 
Dot Complicated. Connected 
to this website, Zuckerberg 
is also publishing two books, 
one of which — Dot Compli-
cated — addresses content 
similar to the website. Zucker-
berg is working on a children’s 
book, Dot, which The Jim 
Henson Company is develop-
ing into a TV show.
These books address the 
role that technology plays 
in people’s lives. Zuckerberg 
was inspired by her son, who 
“made me think about tech-
nology in a whole new way.” 
Zuckerberg said she had the 
“responsibility for the balance 
of technology in his life.”
“Our relationship with 
technology is not 100 per-
cent healthy,” Zuckerberg re-
marked. “A lot of that is my 
family’s fault. Sorry.”
Zuckerberg spent a large 
part of her lecture address-
ing upcoming trends in the 
technology world and trends 
which can empower the mod-
ern entrepreneur, ranging 
from Google Glass, to Ama-
zon’s drone delivery program, 
to the movement to unplug 
from technology on vacation, 
to encouraging STEM educa-
tion for young children.
Zuckerberg tied these ob-
servations in with Dot Compli-
cated, aiming to offer a “bal-
anced point of view of both 
the opportunities presented 
and the challenges.”

found applications for algo-
rithms — what Blum called 
the “basic building blocks of 
computer science” — outside 
of computer science theory, 
using them for everything 
from mapping logistics and 
distribution centers for Fed-
eral Express to managing 
auctions. Around this time, 
too, Blum said, there was a 
decrease in federal research 
funding. “There used to be 
more funding for basic re-
search from the government; 
in the past 10, 15 years fund-
ing has gone down, which is 
really a shame because the 
major innovations of our com-
pany have come from basic 
research,” Blum said. “I had 
this bright idea. I thought, 
well a lot of our products are 
close to commercialization, 
so why don’t I commercialize 
them and bring money back 
for research?”
From there, Blum cre-
ated Project Olympus, which 
has nurtured close to 150 
PRoblem-Oriented Business 
Explorations (PROBEs) since 
its inception. From these 
PROBEs, 99 companies have 
been founded — 76 student-
based and 23 faculty- or inno-
vation fellow-based.
Recently, Project Olympus 
partnered with the Tepper 
School of Business’s Donald 
H. Jones Center for Entrepre-
neurship to form the Center 
for Innovation and Entrepre-
neurship, which Blum co-di-
rects with Dave Mawhinney, 
assistant teaching professor 
of entrepreneurship and ex-
ecutive director of the Don-
ald H. Jones Center.
“Project Olympus played a 
crucial role in the formation 
of SolePower,” Davitian said. 
Davitian stressed the mentor-
ship to which Project Olym-
pus gave Stanton and Alex-
ander access. “It provided 
Matt and Hahna with a place 
to work as well as needed ad-
vice and mentoring on how 
to start a business. Kit Need-
ham and the rest of the staff 
at Project Olympus helped 
Matt and Hahna on learning 
how to create a solid busi-
ness plan, go to market strat-
egy, and other crucial aspects 
of business development. 
[Dave] Mawhinney also had 
a large role in mentoring 
them and helping them un-
derstand what it takes to start 
a successful business.”
SolePower is only one of 
many successful companies 
that have come out of Proj-
ect Olympus and the Center 
for Innovation and Entrepre-
neurship, such as DuoLingo, 
a popular smartphone app 
for learning new languages, 
and OpenCurriculum, an 
online platform for creating 
and sharing K–12 learning 
material.
SolePower was also part 
of AlphaLab cycle 10, from 
January 2013 to May 2013. 
As part of AlphaLab, Sole-
Power received $25,000 and 
business knowledge which, 
Davitian said, “has been 
much more viable than the 
?nancial bene?ts of AlphaL-
ab.” Davitian continued, “The 
program connected SolePow-
er with an amazing group of 
mentors and advisors.”
Although SolePower’s 
current model requires a 15-
mile hike to charge a stan-
dard smartphone, Staton 
said, “The company is work-
ing toward a design that can 
charge an iPhone after less 
than ?ve miles of hiking and 
withstand about 100 million 
footsteps of wear and tear,” 
according to Popular Science.
SolePower’s ?rst insoles 
are on track to be released by 
the end of this year or early 
next year, Davitian said.

CMU wins Better Buildings contest

Today, students pride 
themselves on much more 
than just attending classes 
and getting good grades. 
Along with classes, many stu-
dents are involved in various 
extracurricular activities to 
supplement their education, 
and Carnegie Mellon students 
are no exception. A perfect 
example is the team of Carn-
egie Mellon graduate students 
who participated in the U.S. 
Department of Energy’s Better 
Buildings Case Competition, 
an annual competition that 
addresses real-world energy 
concerns. The team, Team 
Everpower, won two “Best 
Proposal” awards for their 
solutions. 
The Better Buildings Case 
Competition began in 2012 
and aims to give college stu-
dents an opportunity to gain 
skills and experience related 
to careers in clean energy. The 
program upholds Obama’s 
Better Buildings Initiative goal 
to reduce energy consumption 
by at least 20 percent by 2020 
in commercial and industrial 
buildings across the United 
States. 
The competition incor-
porates a variety of different 
energy ef?ciency topics. The 
Department of 
Energy, along 
with other 
case partners, 
develops a 
num-
ber of cases which incorporate 
real world energy problems. 
These cases are distributed to 
the student teams, who have 
approximately three months 
to produce 10-page solutions 
based on the information pro-
vided and their own research. 
After three months, students 
meet in Washington, D.C. for 
a one-day workshop where 
all the teams present their so-
lutions to expert judges and 
case partners. 
This year’s culminating 
event was held on March 14 
at the Department of Energy 
headquarters and brought 
together 25 participating 
universities, including Carn-
egie Mellon, the 
Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, 
Har-
vard University, Stanford 
University, Yale University, 
Columbia University, and the 
Universities of California, 
Santa Barbara, San Diego, 
and Berkeley.
Team Everpower included 
students from a variety of 
disciplines. The ?nal team 
consisted of Matineh Eyb-
poosh, a doctoral student 
in civil and environmental 
engineering; Rubén Morón, 
a master’s student in the 
School of Architecture; Mat-
thew Plunkett, a master’s stu-

A single cell is home to an 
unfathomable number of mo-
lecular interactions. Over one 
trillion cells work together 
perfectly to produce a well-
oiled machine: the human 
body. Scientists, however, 
are fascinated with how the 
smallest deviation from the 
norm within a cell can have 
catastrophic consequences. 
Comparing RNA expres-
sion in different cells can 
provide an incredible amount 
of insight into these minute 
changes and understand-
ing how they might affect 
the cell. Carl Kingsford, an 
associate professor at Carn-
egie Mellon’s Lane Center 
for Computational Biology, 
and his team have developed 
Sail?sh, a revolutionary new 
software that will allow sci-
entists to analyze massive 
amounts of RNA gene expres-
sion data in a matter of min-
utes, as opposed to previous 
methods which took several 
hours. The tool, which stands 
true to the speedy ?sh it was 
named after, was highlighted 
in a report published online 
in April 2014 in the reputable 
journal Nature Biotechnology. 
Proteins are the catalytic 
molecules responsible for 
what occurs inside a cell at 
any given time. Researchers 
want to learn how the pres-
ence of speci?c proteins can 
impact the characteristics of 
a cell and how it behaves. For 
example, if a protein is found 
to be expressed in a mal-
functioning cell, like a can-
cerous cell, but is absent in 
a healthy cell, scientists can 
conclude that the protein is 
somehow correlated with the 
aberration. 
It is impractical to physi-
cally collect all the proteins 
expressed in a cell and iden-
tify them because protein 
identi?cation technologies 
are not robust. To avoid phys-
ically collecting and charac-
terizing the proteins in a cell, 
scientists have developed the 
technique of RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq). 
RNA is an intermediate 
molecule between DNA and 
proteins. DNA is like a recipe 
book on how to build all the 
proteins in an organism. RNA 
can be considered a messen-
ger molecule that translates 
the DNA into a language that 
the cell can understand. The 
RNA produced are for the 
proteins that the cell is ac-
tively making and expressing 
at a given time. 
Scientists collect thou-
sands of RNA molecules in-
side a cell that range from a 
few to hundreds of base pairs 
in length. Then, they use ro-
bust sequencing technologies 
to determine the sequence of 
bases that make up the mol-
ecules. However, deciphering 
the RNA code to identify the 
protein it instructs to build is 
another challenge in its own 
right. 
Current techniques in 
computational biology mod-
el a string search problem, 
which involves compar-
ing the RNA sequences to a 
large database of sequences 
and identifying the best 
match. While this has been 
a hot computational biol-
ogy research topic in recent 
years, current methods take

HOW THINGS WORKDinosaur fossils are extracted from surrounding matrix
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
News Editor
While most visitors to Pittsburgh 
know that the city breaks records 
for its number of bridges and bars, 
far fewer know that Pittsburgh’s 
Carnegie Museum of Natural His-
tory houses the third-largest collec-
tion of mounted and displayed di-
nosaurs in the U.S., behind only the 
Smithsonian’s National Museum of 
Natural History in Washington, D.C. 
and the American Museum of Natu-
ral History in New York.
As anyone who’s seen the open-
ing scene of Jurassic Park knows, 
getting dinosaur fossils from the 
ground to a museum hall takes a lot 
of work. 
At the Carnegie Museum of 
Natural History, visitors can look 
through glass walls to watch the 
work of the fossil preparators, 
whose job it is to remove fossils from 
the rock — or matrix — surround-
ing them. Although fossils can be 
formed in several different ways, 
one of the more common fossiliza-
tion processes is permineralization. 
During permineralization, cavi-
ties in organic matter that have 
been buried under layers of sedi-
ment and earth are ?lled in with 
mineral-rich groundwater. Over the 
course of millions of years, minerals 
in the groundwater precipitate and 
harden the surrounding organic 
matter, which, depending on how 
decayed the body was when it was 
buried, can be just bones or teeth or 
even skin and feathers. 
Dinosaur fossils — which are 
roughly between 65 and 245 million 
years old — are delicate, requiring a 
gentle attention to 
de-
tail to extract from their surround-
ing matrix. Still, accidents happen: 
when a fossil breaks, preparators re-
pair it with glue designed speci?cal-
ly for fossils. After a fossil is found 
in the ?eld, it is taken to a museum 
wrapped in a plaster and burlap skin 
and a wooden box, a 100-year-old 
method that preserves the fossil and 
surrounding matrix while it is being 
transported. 
There’s not just one technique for 
freeing a fossil from the surround-
ing strata. One method, according 
to the American Museum of Natural 
History, is mechanical extraction, 
when preparators remove the fossil 
from the matrix with physical force. 
To do this, they use tools ranging 
from steel needles to micro-sand-
blasters and mini-jackhammers, 
like the air scribe on display at the 
Carnegie Museum.
Fossil matrix materials can be 
relatively soft, such as chalk, silt-
stone, or sandstone, or much hard-
er, such as conglomerate rock and 
hematitics, which are described 
on the American Museum of Natu-
ral History’s website as “specimens 
covered in a hard layer of iron con-
cretion.” According to the Carnegie 
Museum’s website, it can take two 
days just to work away a piece of 
matrix the size of a deck of cards 
around a small fossil, and a few days 
to work away a piece the size of a ce-
real box around a larger fossil.
For some fossils, preparators 
prefer chemical preparation. 
During chemical prepara-
tion, various 
chemical compounds are used to 
dissolve the matrix around a fossil. 
While chemical preparation has its 
own set of risks — using the wrong 
chemicals on a fossil can damage 
the specimen as well as the matrix, 
for example — it also has great ad-
vantages for fossils too small or deli-
cate to be extracted mechanically. 
Chemical preparation requires 
careful analysis of the fossil and 
matrix to choose the right kind of 
chemical bath. For fossils in a lime-
stone matrix, for example, prepara-
tors typically use an acidic solution, 
which would break the stone down 
into carbon dioxide and calcium 
ions. In specimens where iron ox-
ide has formed a crust on the fossil 
itself, preparators may use either 
thioglycollic acid or the preferred 
Waller Method, which uses a solu-
tion of three sodium salts to break 
iron down into a neutral pH solu-
tion. 
If the preparators want to keep 
a skeleton’s structure intact, they 
may use transfer preparation, a 
technique developed in the 1950s 
and still in use today. During this 
process, half of the fossil is encased 
in polyester resin and placed in a 
bath of formic acid. The acid bath 
eats away the matrix while leaving 
the bone intact and supported by 
the resin, preserving the relation-
ship of articulated parts after matrix 
removal. 
When a fossil is ?nally free, it’s 
connected into a skeleton and put 
on display. While most of the dino-
saur skeletons visitors see at muse-
ums look like the real thing, they 
are often partly or wholly made up 
of plaster casts. It’s extremely rare 
to ?nd a fully fossilized dinosaur 
skeleton; missing pieces of a skel-
eton are usually ?lled in with bones 
from another fossil of the same ani-
mal or a very similar species. Casts, 
which are made using latex rubber, 
are often exchanged between insti-
tutions for research purposes, 
or used to make the sur-
face details of a fossil 
clearer. 
For many, the most 
striking part of a dino-
saur’s skeleton is its skull. 
Dinosaur skulls are, in fact, 
extremely rare, and are generally 
too heavy to safely mount. Instead, 
a cast of the skull is attached to the 
skeleton on display. 
The Carnegie Museum of Natu-
ral History began its extensive 
fossil collection with Diplodo-
cus carnegii, a dinosaur 
that lived in the late Jurassic period 
and whose fossil was ?rst found in 
the Badlands in Wyoming in 1899, 
after which it was acquired by An-
drew Carnegie. Carnegie sent plas-
ter casts of the fossilized skeleton to 
museums around the world; casts of 
the Carnegie Museum’s diplodocus 
fossil are on display on four differ-
ent continents, according to the 
museum’s website. Outside the mu-
seum itself, a statue of “Dippy” the 
diplodocus, made during the 100th 
anniversary year of the fossil’s dis-
covery, recreates the dinosaur in 
?berglass.

New computational method 
allows for faster gene analysisCarnegie Mellon team wins two Best Proposal awards 
Business; Vedran Lešic, a Ful-
bright scholar in engineering 
and public policy; and doctor-
al students in engineering and 
public policy Casey Can?eld, 
Julian Lamy, and Nathaniel 
Horner.
“Someone from [engineer-
ing and public policy] has 
been on the team every year,” 
explained Can?eld. “We had 
a bunch of engineering stu-
dents interested, but we had 
to work a little bit harder to 
get people from Tepper and 
people from architecture.”
The team was assigned two 
cases. The ?rst, titled “Picking 
up PACE: Taking Commercial 
PACE Financing to Scale,” 
involved the development 
of a program and business 
plan for states to enact Prop-
erty Assessed Clean Energy 
(PACE) ?nancing, a method 
of attaching loans to build-
ings instead of a person, while 
increasing energy ef?ciency. 
As a solution, the team 
proposed using a diffusion 
model to build up the pro-
gram over time and placed 
an emphasis on the adver-
tisement of the non-energy 
savings bene?ts of energy-
ef?ciency such as increased 
health and productivity. 
“The judges said it was the 
most realistic and complete 
proposal, which is why I think 
we ended up winning,” said 
Can?eld.
The second case assigned 
to Team Everpower was titled 
“A Side of Savings: Energy 
Ef?ciency in the Restaurant 
Franchise Model.” This case 
dealt with incentives for fast-
food restaurants to invest in 
energy ef?ciency. The team 
proposed a competition be-
tween restaurants that would 
use cash prizes to encourage 
energy ef?ciency through be-
havioral changes and invest-
ment in new technology. 
“The idea is that each 
store that participates would 
realize the bene?ts of any 
of these measures that they 
took, whether it’s investing in 
new equipment or improving 
their processes, but in addi-
tion to that there’s the incen-
tive to participate because of 
the competition,” said Lamy. 
“It would give all stores a kind 
of common ground and com-
mon platform to invest in dif-
ferent things.” 
For each case, two awards 
were given out: “Most Inno-
vative” and “Best Proposal.” 
Team Everpower won “Best 
Proposal” for both of their 
cases. 
The members of Team 
Everpower also commented 
on the bene?ts they person-
ally gained from the competi-
tion. 
“For me, coming from an 
engineering background, the 
interesting part was working 
on a real project and learn-
ing how I can apply technical 
knowledge to real issues,” said 
Eybpoosh. “We had people in 
our group from many differ-
ent backgrounds and that also 
helped me have a bigger pic-
ture of what I have learned in 
the engineering department.”
The team also stressed the 
fact that these bene?ts are not 
limited to graduate students. 
“One of the things that’s in-
teresting about this competi-
tion is that there aren’t differ-
ent levels, so undergraduates 
compete against graduate 
students. We really wanted 
undergraduates on the team 
because this would be a really 
great opportunity for under-
graduates to get experience,” 
explained Can?eld. 
“It’s a good opportunity for 
Carnegie Mellon undergradu-
ates to get into [research] and 
learn how it works,” added 
Eybpoosh. 
GENE, from A4
six hours to identify anywhere 
from 30 million to 100 million 
RNA sequences, depending 
on the number of sequences. 
The time-intensive step is 
in mapping the large string of 
letters to its complementary 
sequence in the database. 
Kingsford explained that 
“what makes Sail?sh so fast 
is to do away with this map-
ping step. Instead of matching 
the whole RNA sequence at 
one time, Sail?sh ?rst breaks 
down the input into all possi-
ble fragments of size k which 
are appropriately called k-
mers.” 
Next, the program iden-
ti?es all the different RNA 
sequences in the database 
where each k-mer could 
be found. The database se-
quence that has the highest 
coverage of k-mers will be the 
corresponding sequence help-
ing to identify the protein that 
the sequence codes for. 
Searching for these k-
mers is computationally less 
intensive than searching for 
a whole sequence because it 
is no longer a string search 
problem. 
The database can be con-
structed as a minimum per-
fect hash table matching each 
possible k-mer from the da-
tabase to all the possible se-
quences in the database that 
contain that speci?c k-mer. In 
computer science, hash tables 
are ef?cient data structures 
that store and search through 
information. 
Kingsford described that 
the idea of breaking down 
large sequences into smaller 
k-mers is a technique that 
is commonly utilized in ge-
nome assembly. He added, 
“researchers had strayed 
away from applying this 
idea to RNA-seq because 
they thought breaking the 
sequence caused a loss of 
information.” 
Instead, Kingsford and his 
team found that “despite los-
ing some information, you 
gain in freedom.... In some 
cases, the analysis will be 
actually more accurate than 
older methods.”
Sail?sh is more accurate 
because it does not incor-
porate mismatches between 
the search sequence and the 
database sequence into the 
analysis. DNA and RNA can be 
somewhat variable between 
different individuals so it is 
very likely that a whole se-
quence will never be a perfect 
match. Older mapping meth-
ods are exponentially slowed 
down by the errors that are 
allowed between the search 
and database sequence. In 
this primitive system, some 
sequences will never ?nd a 
match and be thrown out be-
cause of too many mismatch-
es. Kingsford explained that 
in their new method, k-mers 
that have mismatches are not 
considered. 
However, there are other 
k-mers that don’t have mis-
matches which will be suf-
?cient in matching the ap-
propriate sequences. Thus, 
no complete RNA sequence 
in analysis will be thrown out 
simply because of a few mis-
matches. 
Rob Patro, a post-doctoral 
research associate working 
under Kingsford, was re-
sponsible for the majority of 
the coding and testing of the 
software. 
They collaborated with 
Stephen M. Mount, an associ-
ate professor in the University 
of Maryland’s Department of 
Cell Biology and Molecular 
Genetics and its Center for 
Bioinformatics and Computa-
tional Biology.
In November of 2013, the 
group released their code 
and started a forum for users 
to discuss their experiences. 
Kingsford shared emphati-
cally that users were having 
“very positive experiences” 
and that “it is very rewarding 
to go from an idea to imple-
mentation and then to actual 
users so they can actually do 
what they want to do.” They 
spent the past six months 
working on their publication. 
Previously, researchers 
were limited in their RNA 
sequencing studies because 
of the time required for such 
intensive computation. Kings-
ford hopes that this speedy 
software will “let researchers 
do much more exploratory 
analysis, test many more con-
ditions getting millions and 
millions of RNA sequences 
and comparing them to even 
larger data sets.” 
Kingsford and his team will 
continue to improve their soft-
ware, possibly enabling other 
scientists to make discoveries 
furthering the human under-
standing of the beautiful com-
plexity of biology.

BROOKE KUEI
SciTech Editor
What if you could go back 
in time? What if you could go 
so far into the past that you 
could see the beginning of the 
universe?
David Spergel, chair of the 
department of astrophysical 
sciences at Princeton Univer-
sity, took his audience back 
in time at the second Bennett-
McWilliams lecture in Rashid 
Auditorium last Thursday 
with his creatively named talk, 
“Taking the Universe’s Baby 
Picture.”
The truth is, you are trav-
eling into the past each time 
you look up at the night sky. 
The stars are so far away that 
by the time the light they are 
emitting — which travels very 
fast, but still at a ?nite speed 
— reaches your eyes, you are 
seeing the stars not as they ex-
ist in the sky at that moment, 
but how they were when that 
light ?rst left the star.
“If you were on a planet 
10 light-years away and were 
looking at Earth, you would 
see all of us as we were 10 
years ago — and I had more 
hair,” Spergel joked. It makes 
sense, then, that the farther 
away an object you are look-
ing at is, the older a version of 
it you will see.
It is this concept that allows 
researchers to use the cos-
mic microwave background 
(CMB) to study the universe’s 
history. The CMB is essen-
tially leftover heat from the 
Big Bang. When the universe 
was young, it was very hot and 
very dense, and protons and 
electrons moved around freely 
in plasma. 
However, as the universe 
expanded and cooled, pro-
tons and electrons began to 
combine and photons — that 
is, light — began to decouple 
from the matter. It is this light, 
which has moved freely from 
then to now, which gives us a 
window into the universe’s ini-
tial conditions.
“The microwave back-
ground is a wonderful thing 
to study if you want to under-
stand the evolution of the uni-
verse’s history,” said Spergel. 
“Because it really is, I’ll argue, 
the universe’s baby picture.”
So what exactly does a 
map of the CMB look like? 
You might be familiar with the 
famous CMB pictures, which 
look like an oval on which var-
ious patches of different colors 
are dispersed, that have been 
published by surveys such 
as Planck and the Wilkinson 
Microwave Anisotropy Probe 
(WMAP). These different col-
ors correspond to the slightly 
different temperatures across 
the universe.
“What we want to do is 
look at this pattern and study 
the ‘lumpiness’ as a function 
of scale. What is the character-
istic scale of the hot and cold 
spots on this map?” Spergel 
explained.
To illustrate his point, Sper-
gel showed the baby pictures 
of his own children — “Three 
completely randomly selected 
babies,” he assured, as the 
crowd chuckled — followed 
by a more recent picture of 
them.
“Given the initial condi-
tions, you can extrapolate 
forward to today,” Spergel 
explained. “Now, this will not 
work with babies … but the 
universe turns out to be more 
simple.” 
Using computer simula-
tions of the initial conditions 
of our universe and evolving 
them forward in time, we can 
compare our predictions of the 
present universe’s “lumpiness” 
to actual observations, and it 
turns out that they match re-
markably well.
While the ?rst half of 
Spergel’s talk began with the 
universe’s initial conditions 
and went forward in time to 
the present day, the second 
portion of his talk was about 
how observations made in the 
present can take people back 
in time to the universe’s ?rst 
moments, a discussion which 
revolved around the theory of 
in?ation.
“The way that I think about 
the motivation for in?ation 
comes from having taught for 
a number of years,” Spergel 
said. He explained the theory 
with an example: If you gave 
an exam to a classroom full 
of students and every student 
handed back their exams with 
the same answers, one of two 
things must have happened — 
either there was communica-
tion between the students dur-
ing the exam, or the students 
shared the same information 
beforehand.
Similarly, when we look at 
the many different regions of 
the CMB, all of the patches are 
the same temperature, with 
only minuscule ?uctuations 
between them. However, ac-
cording to the standard Big 
Bang Theory, these regions of 
the sky did not have time to 
communicate to each other, 
suggesting that they shared a 
common initial condition. The 
theory of in?ation states that 
these regions once existed at 
a single point, and that the 
universe underwent a rapid, 
exponential expansion to be-
come the universe we know 
today.
During this in?ation, tiny 
ripples in the fabric of space-
time were blown up, result-
ing in the gravitational waves 
that the Background Imaging 
of Cosmic Extragalactic Po-
larization (BICEP2) telescope 
very recently detected, caus-
ing a similar ripple of waves 
to propagate throughout the 
physics community.
“My reaction to this — and 
this might be me being a bit 
of a cynic — is that important 
results deserve careful scru-
tiny,” Spergel cautioned. He 
worried that since the CMB 
is composed of both cosmo-
logical emissions and galactic 
emissions, the signal that was 
detected by BICEP2 could in-
clude contributions from dis-
tant galaxies that were not ac-
counted for. 
In the next two years, 
fortunately, seven different 
experiments will be indepen-
dently working to con?rm the 
discovery.
Between the ?rst Bennett-
McWilliams lecture — which 
occurred in December and fea-
tured Alan Guth, the theorist 
behind in?ation — and Sper-
gel’s lecture last week, gravi-
tational waves have already 
been detected. Spergel’s lec-
ture took the audience on an 
adventure through the past, 
but who knows what greater 
discoveries the future has in 
store for us?
PUGWASH COLUMN
Corporatization is here to stay
JOSEPH ROLLINSON    
Special to The Tartan
With the recent partner-
ship between Yahoo Labs and 
Carnegie Mellon’s computer 
science department and the 
announcement of Google Vice 
President Andrew Moore for 
Carnegie Mellon’s dean of 
computer science, Pugwash 
decided to tackle the emerg-
ing issue of corporatization of 
universities. We were fortu-
nate to be joined by Heather 
Steffen, a literary and cultural 
studies graduate student who 
teaches an interpretation and 
argument course on this topic.
The corporatization of 
universities is de?ned as uni-
versities building closer ties 
with industry and universities 
acting more like corporations. 
We began our discussion by 
naming examples of corpora-
tization we have run into at 
Carnegie Mellon. The part-
nership with Yahoo Labs was 
fresh in everyone’s mind. Ac-
cording to a Carnegie Mellon 
news release, Project InMind 
is a ?ve year, $10 million 
dollar partnership between 
Yahoo and Carnegie Mellon. 
It is predicated on providing 
Carnegie Mellon researchers 
access to real time data from 
Yahoo services to “speed up 
the pace of mobile and per-
sonalization research and cre-
ate a better user experience,” 
said Ron Brachman, chief sci-
entist and head of Yahoo Labs, 
in the news release. The part-
nership also includes a fellow-
ship program for students and 
faculty with ?nancial support 
from Yahoo, and mentorship 
from researchers at Yahoo 
Labs and Carnegie Mellon.
We also discussed Carn-
egie Mellon’s Silicon Valley 
campus, which according to 
its homepage, works “with 
partners in the San Francisco 
Bay Area to establish a natu-
ral extension for the univer-
sity’s acclaimed graduate 
degree programs, innovative 
research, and support for en-
trepreneurs.” A ?nal example 
of corporatization at Carnegie 
Mellon is the interpretation 
and argument class that every 
?rst-year must go through, 
which is taught by adjunct 
professors and teaching assis-
tants at a much lower cost to 
the university.
Our discussion then moved 
on to the effect of corporatiza-
tion on teaching. According 
to the American Association 
of University Professors, 76 
percent of instructional staff 
appointments in American 
higher education are non-
tenure-track appointments. 
Non-tenure-track faculty are 
advantageous to universities, 
because they are less expen-
sive than tenure-track faculty. 
However, the American Asso-
ciation of University Profes-
sors remarks that the use of 
contingent faculty “damages 
student learning, faculty gov-
ernance, and academic free-
dom.” We then discussed the 
effect of corporatization on 
research. Steffen gave a won-
derful summary of the history 
of the relationship between 
universities and business of 
which only the ?nal point will 
be provided here. The Bayh-
Dole Act of 1980 allowed uni-
versities to hold the patents 
for the results of research con-
ducted with federal funding. 
Since then, federal sponsor-
ship for university research 
has declined whilst corporate 
sponsorship has increased. 
This change in sponsorship 
is not without cost. Accord-
ing to The Guardian, “Pitts-
burgh based industry group, 
the Marcellus Shale Coali-
tion, canceled its funding of 
a Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity research project after two 
faculty members bowed out, 
citing bias in the study. An 
earlier Penn State report, also 
paid for by the natural gas 
industry, was used by Penn-
sylvania legislators in 2009 to 
kill a state tax on gas drillers.” 
Research can be controlled 
and skewed indirectly by the 
sponsors.
After this quite depress-
ing look at universities, we 
turned the discussion to what 
we can do to preserve the ben-
e?ts of corporate sponsorship 
whilst dampening the costs. 
First, teachers must rally to-
gether to win back their voice. 
Adjunct faculty and gradu-
ate students are increasingly 
unionizing and pushing for 
better working conditions. 
Second, universities need 
more control over their cor-
porate sponsorship. For ex-
ample, if Pennsylvania State 
University had a contract with 
the Marcellus Shale Coali-
tion stating that the funding 
would continue, even if nega-
tive results came out, the bias 
may never have occurred. Ob-
viously, these two suggestions 
are not perfect and require re-
?nement, but they are a step 
in the right direction. 
Corporatization is here to 
stay. Universities must learn 
to control it.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational organi-
zation that discusses the impli-
cations of science. This article 
is a summary of last week’s dis-
cussion on the corportization 
of academics.

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is leftover radiation from the Big Bang and helps astronomers study the universe’s history.
Chernobyl birds adapt to radiation
Ecologists have found that 
birds living near Chernobyl 
are adapting, and even ben-
e?ting, from long-term expo-
sure to radiation. While pre-
vious studies suggested that 
exposure to radiation deplet-
ed antioxidants and increased 
oxidative stress, the research-
ers found the opposite hap-
pening in the birds. A greater 
exposure to ionizing radiation 
instead increased antioxi-
dants and increased the ani-
mals’ resistance to larger 
doses of radiation. The ecolo-
gists captured 152 birds, mea-
sured background radiation 
levels, and then took blood 
and feather samples before 
releasing the birds. The re-
sults of the study also helped 
scientists further distinguish 
between the different species 
of birds in the area.

Worry spreads over emerging virus
As of Friday, there have 
been 92 deaths and 313 con-
?rmed cases of Middle-East-
ern Respiratory Syndrome 
(MERS). Most of the cases 
have been in Saudi Arabia and 
the United Arab Emirates, and 
the virus can be transmitted 
between people. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) 
and the Centers for Disease 
and Control Prevention are 
preparing for outbreaks in 
case the virus spreads from 
the region, such as through 
air travel. 
Scientists believe the virus 
resides in camels and recently 
jumped to humans. Current-
ly, it seems that MERS only 
spreads from one person and 
then stops transmission.

Scientists decode tsetse ?y genome
Scientists have recently de-
coded the genome of the tse-
tse ?y, an insect that spreads 
the parasitic disease, sleeping 
sickness, in Africa. The scien-
tists speci?cally looked at the 
genome of Glossina morsitans, 
one of the species of tsetse 
?ies. The project took over a 
decade, partially due to the 
unique biology of the crea-
ture. For example, tsetse ?ies 
are the only insects to nurse 
their young. While other in-
sects give birth to hundreds 
of eggs, tsetse ?ies typically 
hatch only one larvae, which 
complicates sequencing be-
cause geneticists need to look 
at nearly identical or closely 
related females ?ies in order 
to accurately sequence a ge-
nome. Tsetse ?ies typically 
only produce 10 progeny in 
their life span.

FDA may regulate e-cigarettes
The Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) has re-
cently announced plans to 
control cigars, pipe tobacco, 
hookah, and e-cigarettes. E-
cigarettes are devices that 
deliver water vapor with 
nicotine. The new proposal 
by the FDA would limit legal 
purchase of these products to 
those over 18 years old, simi-
lar to regulations put in place 
regarding chewing tobacco 
and cigarettes. 
While some have touted 
claims that e-cigarettes are 
an alternative to help current 
smokers quit, studies have 
shown little evidence. Rather, 
the products might introduce 
more individuals to tobacco 
products.

Y chromosome no longer shrinking
Previous research has 
shown that the Y chromo-
some — the sex chromosome 
found in males — has signi?-
cantly shrunk over the past 
hundred million years. Scien-
tists now say, however, that 
the Y chromosome has been 
stable for the past 25 million 
years according to a paper 
published in Nature. The au-
thors state that in addition 
to sex determination, genes 
on the Y chromosome are in-
volved in protein synthesis, 
gene activation, and gene 
splicing. Scientists analyzed 
the Y chromosome in eight 
mammalian species. They 
looked at the chromosome in 
animals that appear relatively 
early in the fossil record, such 
as mice, and compared them 
with those that appear later, 
such as humans.

Recent liquid is found on Mars
Research by scientists at 
the University of Gothenburg 
in Sweden suggests that there 
was liquid on Mars as recently 
as 200,000 years ago. The 
?nding can be traced to the 
discovery of a young crater 
on the southern hemisphere 
of the planet. The crater con-
tains well-preserved gullies 
and debris ?ow deposits. 
These formations indicate 
that the crater was formed 
by liquid water relatively 
recently. 
The research group com-
pared the landforms in the 
crater with similar ones on 
Earth.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
At the close of  every school year, The 
Tartan reassesses the year’s events. 
We present here a list of people and 
happenings that are worthy of rec-
ognition. Thistles go to people and 
events that had a positive effect on the 
campus community and the world at 
large; Thorns go to those that have 
negatively impacted the community.
A thistle to the Carnival Com-
mittee and all who actively 
participated in organizing a 
memorable 100th Spring Carnival. 
This year’s Spring Carnival was com-
plete with some of the best booths 
we’ve seen in years and not one, but 
two, artists for the Carnival Concert.
A thorn to the individual who 
cut off the arm of the child stat-
ue of “Walking to the Sky.” Al-
though the sculpture is often regard-
ed negatively by the student body, it 
is still a centerpiece visual of the uni-
versity, and one that should be re-
spected and remain completely 
intact.
A thistle to ?rst-year econom-
ics and statistics double major 
and Senate sergeant at arms 
Vaasavi Unnava and Student Senate 
for a successful “The First Lectures” 
series. These lectures provided great 
insight from graduating seniors 
about ?nding one’s footing at Carne-
gie Mellon and served to help rede-
?ne success at the university.
A thorn to Russia for its human 
rights violations, in regard to 
the current debacle in Crimea 
and discrimination in the 2014 Win-
ter Olympics.
A thistle to the states of Colo-
rado and Washington for legal-
izing and regulating the sale of 
marijuana, generating additional tax 
income from a drug already in regu-
lar use. Progressive drug policies 
have the potential to raise millions in 
state revenues and decrease impris-
onment for drug possession.
A thorn to the Boy Scouts of 
America for reinforcing their 
ban on LGBTQ leaders and vol-
unteers even as they ?nally conced-
ed to public pressure to allow openly 
gay youth to join. Equal rights can-
not be compromised upon, and a 
compromise in favor of further dis-
crimination is hypocrisy at the high-
est level.
A thistle to sophomore civil 
and environmental engineer-
ing major Angela Ng and Proj-
ect Smile for spearheading the Mind-
fulness Room, a space for students to 
relax and think introspectively and a 
place of respite within the con?nes 
of stressful academia. While the 
room is still underused, it exists for a 
worthy cause.
A thorn to the academic audit, 
which remains woefully out-
dated while other online tools 
such as Student Information Online 
and Andrew Webmail are making big 
strides toward user-friendly access.
A thorn to the state of Pennsyl-
vania for allowing the rampant 
use of hydraulic fracking. The 
fracking process is connected with 
numerous environmental hazards 
such as contaminated drinking water 
supplies and is used to drill for non-
renewable and emissions-generating 
fuel.
A thistle to Carnegie Mellon 
Dining Services’s expanded 
and improved dining options 
this year, from the healthy menu op-
tions at the Underground to the ex-
tended Entropy+ hours, among oth-
er positive changes.
A thorn to Carnegie Mellon’s 
Career Center for moving into 
the West Wing residence. West 
Wing is one of the most coveted 
dorm buildings on campus, and will 
now lose available rooms due to the 
career center relocation.
A thistle to this year’s runners 
in the Boston Marathon for re-
turning to the course in record 
numbers after last year’s bombings, 
honoring all those who died or were 
injured during last year’s race.
A thorn to the United States 
Congress for the government 
shutdown last fall. The fact that 
partisan politics were allowed to 
overcome good governing is 
disgraceful.
A thistle to the incoming stu-
dent government executives 
— in particular, Student Body 
President Elect Ian Glasner and Stu-
dent Body Vice President Elect Shali-
ni Ray. They ran on a strong platform 
of targeting student unity and im-
proving campus policies, and we ex-
pect good things from them over the 
course of their term.
A thorn to Carnegie Mellon for 
receiving a Title IX complaint 
from the American Civil Liber-
ties Union in response to a student’s 
complaint that the university alleg-
edly failed to protect her from an 
abusive ex-girlfriend.
A thistle to the overturning of 
Proposition 8 and the Defense 
of Marriage Act in the Su-
preme Court. This victory was a ma-
jor one for the equal treatment of all 
marriages under federal law as well 
as the freedom to marry, propelling 
state moves toward same-sex mar-
riage legalization across the nation.
A thorn to the Supreme Court 
for striking down limits of ag-
gregate campaign contribu-
tions. Speech should not have mea-
surable units and citizens’ jobs 
should not determine the amount of 
speech they have.
A thistle to Nelson Mandela — 
his work as a leader in South 
Africa led to the end of apart-
heid and the development of a stable 
democracy. He was awarded the No-
bel Peace Price in 1993 and as an el-
der statesman he worked to combat 
poverty and HIV/AIDS. May he rest 
in peace.
A thorn to the National Securi-
ty Agency for not only overstep-
ping its bounds of surveillance 
and data collection, but also for fail-
ing to inform the public of many of 
these practices.
A thistle to current student 
government executives, espe-
cially Student Body President 
Lindsay MacGillivray and Student 
Body Vice President Ian Glasner. 
They led Carnegie Mellon well 
throughout the past year, and The 
Tartan thanks them for their service.
A thorn to the regime of Syrian 
President Bashar Assad for its 
use of chemical weapons 
against Syrian civilians in August 
2013. The use of chemical weapons 
is a war crime, and its use against ci-
vilians is especially horri?c.
A thistle to the legalization of 
same-sex marriage in Minne-
sota, New Jersey, Hawaii, Illi-
nois, and New Mexico, as well as ju-
dicial victories in favor of marriage 
equality in Utah, Oklahoma, Ken-
tucky, Virginia, Texas, and Michigan. 
This encouraging forward momen-
tum is unlikely to slow anytime soon.
A thorn to the Simon Initiative 
for covering too broad a scope 
in its goals, and for still being 
unclear as to how it will go about its 
vague goal of “solving the mystery of 
human learning.”
A thistle to State Senator Wen-
dy Davis (D—Texas) for her 
11-hour ?libuster to combat a 
controversial anti-abortion bill, that 
would severely limit abortion servic-
es all across Texas.
A thorn to the violence against 
political protestors in Egypt. 
The increase in violence in July 
and August of 2013 saw hundreds of 
innocent people killed, and such de-
structiveness should not be tolerated.
A thistle to Pittsburgh Mayor 
Bill Peduto, who has been far 
more transparent in his gov-
erning than former Mayor Luke Ra-
venstahl, and has shown a strong 
commitment to growing and devel-
oping this city.
A thorn to Arizona’s proposed 
religious freedom bill. Though 
the bill was vetoed due to na-
tional outrage, it encouraged other 
conservative states to take similar 
measures which could be used to de-
fend discrimination against LGBT 
clientele by businesses and other 
public services.
A thistle to the Andrew Web-
mail update last summer from 
SquirrelMail — a ?awed and 
outdated format — to Google mail.
Don’t let plans get in the way of passions
JOSH SMITH 
Uncertainty is incredibly scary. 
It’s why people are afraid of the 
dark, and why death and what hap-
pens afterward are so important to 
so many cultures and religions. For 
a graduating senior, what’s about to 
happen in a few short weeks has that 
strong air of the unknown.
I don’t want to compare graduat-
ing to death — although the black 
cap and gown don’t help — but 
graduation is a time where many of 
us are saying goodbye to a way of life 
we’ve known for most of our lives. 
We’re trading grades and homework 
for a salary and late nights at the of-
?ce. The mix of excitement and fear 
is palpable.
But at the same time, it’s that un-
certainty that drives us. Adhering to 
a plan and claiming that you know 
for certain where you’ll be in ?ve 
years is not only ridiculous — it’s im-
possible. The most important lesson 
I’ve learned at Carnegie Mellon is 
that instead of being adamant about 
your plans, you should focus on your 
resolve to follow your passions and 
do what you love.
Plans are subject to change, and 
there’s a large number of students at 
Carnegie Mellon who already know 
that. Out of everyone who arrived at 
the university when I did, 232 peo-
ple changed colleges in their under-
graduate career by the start of their 
senior year, according to the Of?ce 
of Institutional Research and Analy-
sis’s Fall 2013 College Enrollment 
Patterns Report. 203 students were 
no longer enrolled at their initial col-
lege within the school by their third 
fall here, and 97 students made the 
decision to switch colleges after just 
one year at Carnegie Mellon.
This number has only been in-
creasing over the years, with 188 of 
seniors in the fall of 2012 enrolled 
in a different college than their ini-
tial college, and 157 seniors in the 
fall of 2011. None of these numbers 
re?ect how many students changed 
majors within their initial college, 
or left the university altogether. Re-
gardless, it’s interesting to see how 
a signi?cant portion of people who I 
competed with and against at House 
Wars made a big change in their aca-
demic careers while here.
The fact is that there’s very little 
that stays the same your whole life. 
Your looks, where you live, your ?-
nances, your career, your friends, 
your plans, and numerous other 
aspects of your life are subject to 
change. That only becomes more 
evident as you enter the workforce. 
According to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, people hold, on average, 
11.3 different jobs from age 18 to 46. 
While that includes promotions and 
job changes within the same career, 
changing how you describe what 
you do or who you work for often 
makes adhering to a plan that much 
more dif?cult. 
So with all of this uncertainty, the 
best thing to do is what makes you 
happy. Barring that it isn’t harmful 
to yourself or others, following your 
passions is the only sure?re way to 
?nd happiness. Your passions can be 
your career, the people in your life, 
or what you do with your spare time.
Even your passions aren’t im-
mune to change. But adhering to a 
plan and having it prove impossible 
will leave you worse off than ?nd-
ing a new calling. There’s a line in 
Chicago Tribune columnist Mary 
Schmich’s famous essay, “Advice, 
like youth, probably just wasted 
on the young,” that this sentiment 
echoes. The line is this: “Don’t feel 
guilty if you don’t know what you 
want to do with your life. The most 
interesting people I know didn’t 
know at 22 what they wanted to do 
with their lives. Some of the most 
interesting 40-year-olds I know still 
don’t.”
I admire people who have plans, 
who have goals, and who have the 
drive to pursue them. That’s the 
case with so many of the talented 
people I know here at Carnegie Mel-
lon. But when things change, when 
you divert from your “plans” — or 
get thrusted out of them — it’s im-
portant not to become discouraged. 
There’s so much that is out of our 
control that it can be scary. That’s 
why it’s important to have a ?rm 
grasp on your passions. Knowing 
who you are, practicing your val-
ues, and letting your passions moti-
vate you will help you ?nd a certain 
level of peace that those who pore 
over why their plans went astray 
won’t know. Uncertainty is incred-
ibly scary, but it helps to know that 
whatever changes, you can take the 
steps to do what you love and, in 
that, ?nd satisfaction.

A PERSON’S OPINION

Colleges need socioeconomic diversity
AMELIA BRITTON
Junior Staffwriter
Diversity is something of a buzz-
word in college admissions, yet it is 
one of the most misrepresented ele-
ments of a school’s identity. Colleges 
are right to focus on diversi?cation, 
but I believe they ignore the socio-
economic homogeneity of their stu-
dent bodies.
Elite universities make an effort 
to be diverse, and by many measures, 
Carnegie Mellon has succeeded. All 
50 states and several dozen countries 
are represented in the student body, 
and data from the Carnegie Mellon 
Diversity Resource Guide shows that 
undergraduate enrollment by non-
white and international students has 
outnumbered white student enroll-
ment every year since 2002. There 
are still more male than female stu-
dents, but that gap is closing steadily.
As a white girl from the Midwest, 
I am neither geographically nor ra-
cially underrepresented here. How-
ever, students from high schools 
like mine are few and far between 
at top-tier universities like Carnegie 
Mellon. I attended an urban pub-
lic high school where 86 percent of 
students from the district are legally 
“economically disadvantaged.” Ac-
cording to a pamphlet published by 
my school district, one-fourth of the 
students do not graduate high school 
in four years.
I am proud of my high school. Our 
attendance rates are above 95 per-
cent and our test scores consistently 
exceed state averages. Not everyone 
attends college, but I wish that deci-
sion was made on a personal basis 
rather than a socioeconomic one. 
Among those who do attend col-
lege, scholarships for “homegrown” 
students at local universities incen-
tivize students to enroll at in-state 
public institutions. I believe many 
more students from my high school 
and schools like it could attend elite 
universities if given the resources, 
information, and ?nancial guidance.
Financial aid documents like the 
FAFSA and CSS Pro?le are tricky to 
navigate, especially for nontradition-
al families. According to the guide-
lines for 2013-14, any noncustodial 
parent must submit supplemental 
paperwork. Since estranged parents 
are considered noncustodial except 
in extraordinary circumstances, the 
onus of tracking down these fam-
ily members falls to the student. A 
deceased parent also complicates a 
student’s assets. Given the stresses 
that accompany these issues of docu-
mentation, students with unusual 
family and ?nancial situations face 
a more arduous process than those 
from typical two-parent households. 
This ?aw could be construed as sys-
tematic discrimination, though I be-
lieve it is more likely an accident of 
the system.
Carnegie Mellon’s ridiculous 
costs are no secret. The tuition and 
fees of over $60,000 put a strain on 
middle class budgets and are abso-
lutely impossible for worse-off fami-
lies. Financial aid makes it possible 
for students from less-than-elite so-
cioeconomic backgrounds to attend 
elite universities. But what does it 
say about our student body that only 
53 percent of students received aid 
last year?
According to admissionsconsul-
tants.com, this percentage is on par 
with Ivy League ?nancial aid. Still, 
the idea that 47 percent of our stu-
dent body can afford the full price of 
tuition seems absurd. We all worked 
hard to get here, but that doesn’t nec-
essarily translate to diverse personal 
histories. Certain life experiences for 
students from middle-to-upper class 
families tend to be similar, whether 
they come from the Bay Area in 
California or the suburbs of Boston.
A caveat: this is not to say that ec-
onomically-disadvantaged students 
are victims of society. Countless stu-
dents have overcome adversity in 
their personal lives in the course of 
their educational journeys. The ar-
gument for greater socioeconomic 
diversity at elite universities is not 
meant to be patronizing, but rather 
hopes to transform popular percep-
tions of who is disadvantaged.
Race remains linked to socioeco-
nomic status in the United States, but 
the latter gives a much fuller repre-
sentation of a student’s background. 
When we consider race alone, the 
rich members of any minority — in 
comparison to the poor members — 
are overrepresented virtually every-
where. 
This is, perhaps, most visible in 
primary and secondary education, 
where public schools are funded 
by property taxes. This means that 
lower-income neighborhoods usu-
ally have lower-quality schools and 
produce a smaller proportion of 
students who go on to higher edu-
cation. Meanwhile, public schools 
in rich areas and private schools are 
better funded, overrepresent rich 
white students, and tend to send 
more students to top-tier universi-
ties. There exists a cycle of economic 
disparity linked to education. Every 
high school has smart, driven, hard-
working students, so universities 
shouldn’t limit the selection of their 
student body to primarily well-off 
high schools.
Colleges should promote diversi-
ty that is broader than race or geog-
raphy. Policies like af?rmative action 
promote racial diversity, but may dis-
regard other elements of identity. In-
corporating socioeconomic data into 
college admissions may solve part of 
the problem, as long as the process is 
transparent. 
Admissions decisions need to be 
made in the context of a student’s life, 
instead of through predominantly 
quantitative analysis. When grades, 
test scores, extracurriculars, and es-
says of two students are considered 
equally strong, the context of the 
students’ achievements — whether 
a personal struggle, family situation, 
or educational obstacle — must be-
come the deciding factor for admis-
sion. Consider a prep school with 
supplemental instruction on stan-
dardized testing, and contrast it with 
an urban, inner-city public school 
with a 30:1 student-faculty ratio, or 
a home-schooled student from the 
rural Great Plains. An SAT score of 
2100 should be evaluated differently 
in each case, and re?ect differently 
on the student in question.
Some colleges already have ad-
missions policies which consider 
personal history, but there is still 
much to be done. Beyond discuss-
ing the issue with Carnegie Mellon’s 
administration, we can promote 
top-tier universities in economically 
challenged school districts. Many 
students in these districts have only 
ever heard of long-shot Ivy League 
schools, or else believe they cannot 
afford them. Students should be en-
couraged to consider all of their op-
tions. For instance, we could make it 
better known that private universi-
ties offer more need-based aid, while 
public universities offer more merit-
based aid. Informing students of 
these intricacies — and emphasizing 
the possibilities for ?nancial aid — 
would broaden the applicant pools 
at elite universities.
Although socioeconomic diversi-
ty is narrowly represented at schools 
like Carnegie Mellon, there is hope. 
A holistic approach to admissions 
would include racial, geographic, 
and cultural diversity — all of which 
would inherently follow socioeco-
nomic integration.

Federal government has power to tackle oligarchy
MOHAMMED BURNY
Staffwriter
In a Tartan article published last 
week entitled “Cut federal power, 
eliminate oligarchy,” staffwriter 
Kyle Henson editorialized that the 
only way to remove oligarchic in-
?uence in American politics today 
is to shrink the federal government 
where these oligarchs exert their 
undue in?uence.
Henson’s editorial was provoked 
by the release of a recent report 
— authored by Martin Gilens and 
Benjamin Page of Princeton and 
Northwestern Universities, respec-
tively — that claimed that “the ma-
jority does not rule, at least not in 
the causal sense of actually deter-
mining policy outcomes. When a 
majority of citizens disagrees with 
economic elites and/or with orga-
nized interests, they generally lose.”
Henson asks us if we should actu-
ally be surprised by this ?nding. At 
the risk of sounding naive, I would 
like to say that I am indeed sur-
prised. His rhetorical question is a 
bit too hard-bitten, and I must pro-
test against the casual cynicism it 
implicitly conveys about our politi-
cal system. 
I do believe that our politics can 
be more inclusive and representa-
tive — than this report claims, and 
insofar as they fall short of this stan-
dard today, I reserve the right to 
be permanently surprised at their 
failure.
More substantially, however, 
Henson argues that if we wish to 
lessen the in?uence of economic 
elites and organized interests in 
our policymaking process, we must 
lessen the power of the federal gov-
ernment itself. The logic of his ar-
gument is quite simple: “The less 
power the government has, the less 
it can do for special interests, and 
the more democratic our society 
will be.” In fact, this logic is fatally 
simple.
The current size of the federal 
government is the result of a centu-
ry’s worth of advocacy by the Ameri-
can people for robust federal inter-
vention against special interests in 
our society. Progressive reformers, 
galvanized by the economic dispar-
ity and political corruption of the 
Gilded Age in the ?rst two decades 
of the 20th century, called for a vig-
orous federal government to serve 
as a counterweight to the powerful 
special interests that then shaped 
public policy. The trustbusting and 
regulatory initiatives of Presidents 
Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wil-
son illustrate the actual role of fed-
eral government in that era, and its 
ideal role ever since.
If Gilens and Page are correct, 
then the federal government today 
has relinquished its former vigor. 
Into the breach have swarmed spe-
cial interests of every variety, who 
have captured the institutions — 
elected and regulatory — once in-
tended to control their activities in 
the marketplace and the polis. Noth-
ing else explains how a majority of 
the American people can be on one 
side of policy debates and consis-
tently lose to elite minorities on the 
other side.
Henson argues that we shall not 
renew our democracy by restricting 
lobbying or regulating campaign ?-
nance. I beg to differ. 
If these policies are enacted, 
then we shall have taken two great 
strides toward renewing our democ-
racy. Such policies can replenish the 
strength of our federal government, 
now long ?agging, and give it a fair 
chance to combat the pernicious 
in?uence of special interests in our 
politics.
Henson claims that we can only 
renew our democracy by moving 
power downward, from the federal 
government to the states. I take 
special exception to this proposal. 
Historically, the federal government 
has been the only power in Ameri-
can society capable of checking the 
power of the special interests. If the 
federal government is deliberately 
stripped of this power, then nothing 
will stand between us and the spe-
cial interests in our society. Oligar-
chy will ?nally supplant democracy 
in our republic.
Both Henson and I would like 
special interests to exert less in?u-
ence in our policymaking process. 
But Henson, in calling for a weaker 
federal government, is actually mak-
ing it vastly easier for special inter-
ests to exert a greater in?uence in 
shaping public policies. I ask him to 
pause and consider an intermediate 
step: Arm the federal government 
once again to combat special inter-
ests, so that the voices of the Ameri-
can people can once again be heard 
in the halls of power.

Fracking is not energy answer for Americans
JUSTIN YAN
Energy has played a signi?cant 
role in economics since the advent 
of the Industrial Revolution. As a 
result, all the world’s economics de-
pend heavily on energy.
During the 1973 oil crisis, the 
international Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries 
(OPEC) embargoed oil, causing a 
400 percent increase in its price. 
This price hike hit the U.S. economy 
brutally, with central banks scram-
bling to cut interest rates to avoid 
the sharp decrease in consumption 
and investment. The crisis showed 
how dependent the United States 
was on the energy market, and why 
the nation needed to ?nd an alterna-
tive to importing oil.
                                       “The fact that 
fracking has 
started to receive 
so much attention 
... means that many 
politicians and 
economists remain 
short-sighted. 
There are bigger 
things at stake 
here — namely 
the livelihood of 
people for the rest 
of this century ...”
Fast forward a few years, and 
one will ?nd that the United States 
is still being accused of waging war 
in Iraq in order to gain access to the 
country’s oil reserves. Moreover, the 
OPEC crisis led to the United States 
searching for natural gas within do-
mestic borders. On a parallel time-
line, the unforgettable Cold War, 
along with the nuclear revolution 
that accompanied it, revealed both 
the potential of nuclear power and 
its associated drawbacks.
When the United States found 
massive domestic shale gas re-
serves, economists immediately be-
gan to forecast what this meant for 
the future of energy. There are sev-
eral reasons as to why the so-called 
“shale revolution” is economically 
signi?cant. Many of America’s oil 
giants have long deserted the na-
tion’s interior, choosing instead 
to seek their fortunes abroad and 
offshore. Shale gas extraction by 
fracking is allowing new, specialized 
?rms to become established, hence 
disrupting the oligopoly that has 
dominated the energy market for 
so long. The rise of these ?rms will 
spur economic growth, creating jobs 
and new sectors in the energy in-
dustry. Economists predict the shale 
revolution to persist as methods are 
streamlined and more natural gas 
reserves found.
But consider this: two weeks ago, 
the United Nations published a re-
port declaring that climate change 
and environmental destruction is 
becoming irreversible and that the 
next decade is decisive for the future 
of the global climate and its stabil-
ity; the negative impact that humans 
have had on the environment can no 
longer be denied by politicians.
The fact that fracking has started 
to receive so much attention, and 
the fact that many see it as a possible 
catalyst for the stuttering American 
economy, means that many politi-
cians and economists remain short-
sighted. There are bigger things at 
stake here — namely the livelihood 
of people for the rest of this century 
and beyond.
Nuclear energy is perhaps the 
most feasible option we have right 
now, while solar and wind energy 
require further research. In a recent 
post two professors and researchers 
at the Earth Institute at Columbia 
University state that nuclear energy 
allows humans to mitigate other-
wise unavoidable climate effects 
from fossil fuels, including natural 
gas. 
Indeed, the Fukushima and 
Three Mile Island crises show that 
we still have work to do, and that 
nuclear energy brings with it a 
massive amount of risk, but it also 
brings a massive amount of bene?t. 
The saying “desperate times call for 
desperate measures” has never been 
more true.
Many lawmakers recognize the 
disparity between economic and 
environmental motivations. Sev-
eral senators have taken steps to 
reignite nuclear innovation in order 
to make it safer and more acces-
sible across the continental United 
States through the proposal of a bill. 
The bill, labeled the Nuclear Waste 
Administration Act, would launch 
more potential sites for storage and 
disposal facilities. The senators be-
hind this bill cross party lines, mak-
ing this proposal a bipartisan effort, 
which is especially encouraging. 
These steps forward are posi-
tive ones which need to be followed 
through, as fracking does not repre-
sent an environmentally conscious 
approach to the economic future of 
the United States.

Bundy stands up for libertarian values
KYLE HENSON 
Say what you want about Cliven 
Bundy, but his standoff against tax 
collectors over unpaid cattle graz-
ing fees is just the reminder America 
needs of our deep roots in libertarian 
insurrection.
If you’re not familiar with Bundy’s 
rebellion, here’s a refresher. Cliven 
Bundy, a Nevada cattle rancher, has 
been grazing his cattle on federal 
lands for over 20 years. In 1993, fed-
eral rules changed, and Bundy was 
required to pay a grazing fee. Twenty 
years and several court orders later, 
Bundy hasn’t paid a dime. As a result, 
a few weeks ago, government of?-
cials tried to herd Bundy’s cattle off 
federal lands. Not to be ousted, Bun-
dy and a gaggle of armed support-
ers showed up to the scene, ready to 
stick it to the man. The federal repre-
sentatives abandoned Bundy’s cattle, 
and are still trying to ?gure out how 
to react.
As outlandish as this might seem 
in today’s society, Bundy is follow-
ing in the footsteps of a long line of 
American rebels, including Daniel 
Shays. Shays was a Revolutionary 
War veteran whose debt-?nanced 
agricultural endeavors were badly 
affected by the post-revolutionary 
economy. When Massachusetts’ Gov-
ernor Bowdoin cracked down on 
debtors, Shays and a group of other 
farmers took arms. Shays and com-
pany confronted Bowdoin’s militia, 
and after a few shots were ?red, both 
forces scattered and the rebellion 
failed. In the subsequent election, 
however, Bowdoin was trounced by 
John Hancock, who lowered taxes 
and eased regulation on debtors. 
A bit closer to home, the Whis-
key Rebellion of 1800 followed a 
similar trajectory, in which Western 
Pennsylvania distillers opposed a 
tax on bartering used grain. George 
Washington, eager to ?ex his new 
constitutional muscles, led a troop 
of 13,000 militiamen to confront 
the rebels, who disbanded before 
the army arrived. Washington won 
the battle but lost the war, however, 
when Thomas Jefferson’s Demo-
cratic Republicans came to power 
in 1801 and repealed the whiskey 
tax. Though Shays’s Rebellion and 
the Whiskey Rebellion failed in their 
original motives, they had a signi?-
cant impact on subsequent electoral 
and legislative outcomes.
Similarly, Bundy’s Rebellion will 
not succeed. When history looks 
back on our racist cattle rancher, 
he’ll be remembered as a nutjob who 
fought the law and saw the law win. 
But it’s worth noting that Bundy’s ac-
tions are bringing important issues 
to the national dialogue. Maybe the 
federal government shouldn’t own 
80 percent of Nevada’s land. Maybe 
taxes and regulations are hurting the 
little guy too much. 
Rebellions like Bundy’s remind 
us of the importance of liberty in our 
country’s past, and make us think 
about its appropriate role in our fu-
ture. As Thomas Jefferson said of 
Shays’s Rebellion, “The tree of lib-
erty must be refreshed from time to 
time with the blood of patriots and 
tyrants.... God forbid we should ever 
be 20 years without such a rebellion; 
what country can preserve its liber-
ties if their rulers are not warned 
from time to time that their people 
preserve the spirit of resistance? Let 
them take arms.”

New FCC policies threat to free Internet
BRANDON SCHMUCK 
Last week, the Federal Commu-
nications Commission (FCC) an-
nounced that it would be propos-
ing new laws on net neutrality that 
would allow Internet companies to 
charge in order to prioritize connec-
tions to web services. This comes 
less than two months after Net?ix 
announced a deal with Comcast to 
install its own servers on Comcast’s 
networks, which would allow them 
to provide better streaming speeds to 
customers. Such a change in the way 
Internet service is conducted throws 
many questions into the air, includ-
ing the future of the Internet itself.
The New York Times reports that 
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is con-
vinced that this new proposal will 
not be “gutting the Open Internet 
rule.” However, as a former cable 
company lobbyist, he was described 
by The Verge as “the man who could 
control your digital life.”
Essentially, this new set of laws 
would give Internet providers the 
ability to charge large companies 
large sums of money to have an edge 
over their competition and new start-
ups. In addition, these laws introduce 
another signi?cant issue: the pricing 
of competition. For example, Dish 
Network and other television provid-
ers currently offer online streaming 
of television shows. However, Dish 
Network is a direct rival of Comcast’s 
cable television service. This rivalry 
means that Comcast could essential-
ly tell Dish that it must pay millions 
of dollars or else suffer from slower 
streaming speeds on its networks.
Under current standards, net 
neutrality is the idea that all Internet 
traf?c should be treated equally. If I 
create a blog, access to it is treated 
the same as any multimillion dollar 
website. If someone loads my blog or 
The New York Times, the Internet pro-
vider will give it the same priority.
The FCC ensures that “in all in-
stances, broadband providers would 
need to act in a commercially reason-
able manner subject to [FCC] review 
on a case-by-case basis,” according 
to PCWorld.com. However, should 
we really trust the principles of net 
neutrality with the man who lobbied 
for massive cable companies?
The Internet has had such an 
enormous impact on the world be-
cause it is completely different from 
any form of media that existed before 
it. It gave what PressThink blogger 
Jay Rosen calls “the people formerly 
known as the audience” the ability to 
become part of the media, instead of 
simply tuning in. Traditional televi-
sion has become an archaic form of 
media because it has failed to adapt 
to this new idea that the audience 
and the media are now synonymous.
Classic television as a form of me-
dia is slowly dying. Should we trust 
the man who lobbied for cable com-
panies with a new and very different 
form of media? If companies can pay 
Comcast or other Internet providers 
for preferential service, could the 
future Internet turn into something 
more like the television services it is 
currently replacing? If a new social 
network, gaming, or video streaming 
company wants to enter the industry, 
will large amounts of red tape and 
throttled Internet speeds cause them 
to have no chance whatsoever to 
catch up with the big corporations?
This proposal would open the 
possibility of Net?ix becoming the 
next NBC or CBS, and create an oli-
gopoly where a college student or 
other ordinary person can no longer 
create the next big thing. 
If policies like the ones the FCC is 
currently proposing existed a decade 
ago, perhaps Mark Zuckerberg could 
not have created Facebook. Perhaps 
Twitter, Dropbox, and other Inter-
net-age companies would never have 
been started.
The Internet has become the 
place it is because anyone can create 
something great without the fear of 
red tape holding them back. Until 
now, Internet service has been treat-
ed as a utility, like water ?owing to 
one’s home. 
However, if Net?ix, Facebook, 
and YouTube can pay Comcast to be 
the only services without unbearably 
slow speeds, perhaps that will stem 
the ?ow of a free Internet as we know 
it.

April has not been kind to the Pi-
rates. The start of the season after 
their magical playoff run has been 
less than spectacular as they sit in 
fourth place in their division, over 
eight games behind the upstart Mil-
waukee Brewers.
After sitting put during 
the offseason, it looked like 
management was putting 
their hopes on Pittsburgh 
repeating the strategy of 
taping holes in the roster 
with veteran players 
trying to rebuild their 
careers.
Sadly, lightning never strikes 
twice, and with the loss of ace A.J. 
Burnett and last year's in-season 
rentals Marlon Byrd and Justin Mor-
neau, the Pirates are even thinner 
this year.
Last year’s team stayed in games 
with a solid starting rotation and 
shut down bullpen, both of which 
were piecemeal groups of develop-
ing talent and resurging veterans. 
So far this season, the rotation 
has been shaky at best with only 
free agent veteran pitcher Edinson 
Volquez posting a sub-3.5 earned 
run average (ERA). 
Emerging star Gerrit Cole has 
been shaky in his ?rst four starts 
but shows some signs of turning it 
around before the calendar hits May.
The larger problem for Pittsburgh 
has been the bullpen. Last year’s 
team was so dominant they became 
a fundamental part of the team iden-
tity, dubbed the “Shark Tank,” and 
routinely ?nished out close one-run 
Pirates victories. 
This year, the bullpen has had 10 
save opportunities. Saves are funda-
mentally de?ned as the pitcher hav-
ing the chance to ?nish out a close 
game, meaning that the team has 
less than a three-run lead. 
Of these 10 opportunities to win 
the game, the Pirates have converted 
only four of them. Those four saves 
are courtesy of veteran closer Jason 
Grilli. 
Unfortunately, he is also the 
cause of half of the blown saves and 
is currently on the disabled list fol-
lowing his back-to-back blown saves 
last weekend during the Pirates 
abysmal homestand. 
Hopefully his woes came from 
trying to pitch through an injury, 
but setup man Mark Melancon is 
taking over the closers role for at 
least the next two weeks, and de-
pending on his performance, maybe 
permanently.
One of the few consistencies for 
the Pirates has been their offense. 
Unfortunately, this consistency 
is not a good thing, as both this year 
and last, Pittsburgh is missing strong 
bats at several traditionally strong 
offensive positions, namely ?rst base 
and right ?eld. 
To their credit, the Pirates did 
?nally do something about the ?rst 
base issue by making a rare mid-
April trade with the New York Mets, 
getting underperforming slugger Ike 
Davis. 
While Davis may look like an up-
grade, the fact that the Mets were so 
willing to give up on him for pennies 
on the dollar has to raise concerns 
for Pirates fans.
Speaking of underperforming 
corner in?elders, third basemen Pe-
dro Álvarez has regressed as a hitter. 
He has always struggled with the 
balance between hitting for power 
and hitting for average. 
So far, Álvarez has clearly decid-
ed that home runs outweigh batting 
average. His six home runs have him 
on pace for over 40 home runs this 
season. 
Unfortunately, he is also on pace 
for a .176 batting average, which 
would be grounds for benching and 
demotion to the minors for nearly 
any other player without his power.
It’s not too late to try and re-
capture the magic and turn things 
around. Less than a sixth of the 
way through the season, plenty can 
change and there are plenty of other 
trades to be made. 
Hot prospect Gregory Polanco is 
likely to make his major league de-
but in about six weeks after the Pi-
rates maximize his team control go-
ing forward.
Unfortunately, the stark reality of 
the situation is that this is the same 
team the Pirates had last year, but 
the clock is well past midnight for 
this Cinderella story. 
Teams that sit a game out of the 
basement in their division at the end 
of April are rarely capable of ?ipping 
a switch and becoming contenders. 
I really hope Pittsburgh enjoyed its 
small taste of playoff baseball, be-
cause at this pace, it may be a little 
while before Pirates play in October 
again.
SPORTS COMMENTARY
Pirates struggle through April, playoff hopes dashed

The top-10 ranked Carn-
egie Mellon men’s and 
women’s tennis teams both 
competed in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Championships in Orlando 
this weekend. Both teams 
made it to the ?nals, but ul-
timately fell short of taking 
home the title.
The ninth-ranked men’s 
team started off the competi-
tion on Thursday against the 
University of Rochester. 
The Tartans came out 
strong in doubles play and 
jumped out to an early 2–1 
lead after the duos of juniors 
Christian Heaney-Secord and 
Will Duncan and sophomores 
Yuvraj Kumar and Joel Lank-
ford won both of their match-
es, 8–2 and 8–4, respectively.
The Tartans then put it 
away by taking ?ve of six sin-
gles matches on their way to 
a 7–2 match victory. Sopho-
more Abhishek Alla, and ?rst-
years Kiril Kirkov, Duncan, 
and Kumar all won in straight 
sets to quickly seal the victory 
and punch their ticket to the 
semi?nals. Kirkov was par-
ticularly impressive, only sur-
rendering a single game in his 
two sets, 6–1, 6–0.
In the semi?nals on Fri-
day, Carnegie Mellon faced 
off against the fourth-ranked 
Emory Eagles for the right to 
go to the ?nals for the ?rst 
time ever. 
The Tartans came out 
swinging, winning all three 
doubles matches. Heaney-
Secord and Duncan made it 
look easy with their 8–2 win, 
while both Kirkov and junior 
Bryce Beisswanger and ?rst-
year Kenny Zheng and sopho-
more Yurjav Kumar won 8–5. 
The Tartans split the singles 
matches with the Eagles 3–3, 
but moved on to the ?nals due 
to their edge in doubles, win-
ning 6–3. 
All three Carnegie Mel-
lon victories required at least 
one tiebreaker, and only ?rst-
year Kunal Wadwani won in 
only two sets, 7–6 (7–1), 7–5. 
Duncan fought hard for his 
victory, going three sets and 
winning his two both in tie-
breaker, 7–6 (7–5), 4–6, 7–6 
(7–4).
In the Saturday ?nals, the 
Tartans were up against sec-
ond-ranked Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis. Carnegie 
Mellon fought well, but were 
ultimately no match for the 
Bears. 
Kirkov was by far the most 
successful Tartan, winning 
both of Carnegie Mellon’s 
points on the team’s way to a 
2–7 loss. He and Beisswanger 
took the lone doubles victory, 
9–7, and Kirkov was the only 
singles victor for the Tartans, 
winning in straight sets 6–4, 
6–2.
The eighth-ranked wom-
en’s team started out compe-
tition against the University 
of Rochester as well. The 9–0 
victory was their second in a 
row as they looked to be peak-
ing at the right time. 
Junior Angela Pratt and 
?rst-year Nicholle Torres left 
nothing to chance sweeping 
their doubles match 8–0. Ju-
nior Byrn Raschke and ?rst-
year Vanessa Pavia, along 
with senior Katie Cecil and 
sophomore Brooke Tsu, both 
won 8–1.
In singles play, all six wom-
en won in straight sets with 
no one giving up more than 
three games in a single set. 
Sophomore Elizabeth Mar-
tin did not drop a single game 
on her way to a 6–0, 6–0 win, 
while fellow sophomore Ab-
bey Hamstra and junior Lydia 
Utkin each surrendered only 
one game as they each won 
6–0, 6–1.
On Saturday, the women 
took on ninth-ranked Wash-
ington University in St. Louis 
for a chance at the ?nals. This 
time, the Tartans started off a 
bit more sluggishly with only 
Pratt and Torres winning a 
doubles match.
Down 1–2 going into sin-
gles play, Carnegie Mellon 
knew they had to take care of 
business and did just that, tak-
ing ?ve of six singles matches. 
Cecil, Torres, Tsu and Martin 
all won in straight sets, with 
Cecil truly dominating with a 
6–0, 6–1 win. 
Pavia won the ?fth singles 
point, but had to work for it, 
dropping the ?rst set 1–6 be-
fore battling back to take the 
last two sets 7–5 and 6–3.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
faced off against the second-
ranked Emory Eagles in the ?-
nals. It was going to be a long 
day for the Tartans when they 
dropped all three doubles 
matches. Cecil took the one 
Tartan point in singles play as 
she won 6–0, 6–3 on the way 
to the Tartans’ 1–8 loss.
Even though both teams 
left on a bittersweet note after 
falling in the ?nals, the season 
is not over: NCAA Champion-
ship draws will be announced 
on May 5.

This weekend, the Carn-
egie Mellon men’s and wom-
en’s track and ?eld teams 
competed at the University of 
Chicago in the University Ath-
letic Association (UAA) Out-
door Track & Field Champion-
ships. Overall, the men’s team 
?nished second out of seven 
competing schools, and the 
women’s team ?nished sixth.
The men’s team was led by 
its strong throwers, as it was 
all season. In the shot put, 
senior Zachary Erra-Hernan-
dez continued his dominat-
ing season, taking home ?rst 
place with a 15.80-meter 
throw that was 1.38 meters 
further than the runner up. 
Senior Nathan Cheek also 
continued performing well 
as he ?nished in fourth place 
with a 13.79-meter throw.
Cheek and Erra-Hernan-
dez continued in the discus 
event, where they ?nished 
second and third with throws 
of 44.73 and 44.32 meters, 
respectively. They switched 
places in the hammer throw, 
where Erra-Hernandez ?n-
ished second with a 52.19-me-
ter throw and Cheek took 
home third with a 46.56-me-
ter toss. 
The Tartans had another 
two-three ?nish in the jav-
elin throw. First-year Jacob 
Brooks took second with a 
53.38-meter throw, with 
Cheek in third place at 53.14 
meters.
The Tartans also per-
formed well in the other ?eld 
events, with junior Mike Mc-
Dermott ?nishing second in 
the high jump, leaping 1.89 
meters. He also took fourth in 
the pole vault by clearing the 
4.27-meter bar. 
In the long jump, the Tar-
tans took home third- and 
?fth-place ?nishes, with ?rst-
years Don Boyer and Matthew 
Seifu ?nishing with jumps of 
6.69 meters and 6.51 meters, 
respectively.
Carnegie Mellon had a 
tougher time in the track 
events. First-year Andrew 
Chang had a very good day, 
?nishing third in the 200-me-
ter dash — crossing the line in 
21.97 seconds — and fourth 
in the 110-meter hurdles — 
?nishing in 15.68 seconds. 
The 110-meter hurdles 
were dominated by Carnegie 
Mellon, as Chang was just one 
of four Tartans in the eight-
person ?nals. Sophomore Ben 
Neiman ?nished third with a 
time of 15.59. Boyer and ?rst-
year Matthew Sheh ?nished 
sixth and eighth, with times of 
16.14 and 16.46, respectively.
In the 800-meter run, ju-
nior Thomas Vandenberg 
?nished in ?rst place with 
a time of 1:53.68, and in 
the 400-meter hurdle, se-
nior Mike Standish ?nished 
in third place with a time of 
54.80 seconds.
Senior Josh Newby placed 
second in the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase  with a time of 
9:31.06.
The relay team made up 
of Standish, Vandenberg, 
?rst-year Owen Norely, and 
sophomore Marc-Daniel Ju-
lien took home ?rst in the 
4x800-meter relay and third 
in the 4x400-meter relay with 
times of 7:46.25 and 3:20.80, 
respectively.
The women’s team strug-
gled in nearly all aspects of 
the meet, but had a couple top 
performers. Senior Jacque-
line Guevel ?nished second in 
both the 100- and 400-meter 
hurdles, ?nishing with times 
of 15.09 and 1:03.82.
Junior Sasha Spalding 
placed second in the long 
jump with a leap of 5.47 
meters. She also ?nished 
third in the shot put with a 
10.49-meter throw.
In the high jump, ?rst-year 
Rebecca Fortner ?nished in 
fourth place after clearing 
the 1.53-meter bar on her 
?rst attempt, and in the ham-
mer throw, ?rst-year Colette 
Tano ?nished in fourth with a 
42.09-meter throw. 
Both teams will next com-
pete in Allegheny College’s 
Gator Invitational on May 9.

Beijing comes to Pittsburgh
ARCC celebrates Chinese culture with performances, ?lm
One Night in Beijing, the annual Chinese cultural 
performance show held by ARCC (Awareness of 
Roots in Chinese Culture), was held on Saturday 
night.
This year, the theme of the show was “Pig Tales,” 
which featured an overarching skit billed as “an 
original sequel to the famous Journey to the West.” 
Journey to the West, of course, is one of the most 
well-known stories in Chinese literature, featuring 
the adventures of Sun WuKong, the Monkey King, 
and the other disciples of a Buddhist monk, who 
travel from China to India on a pilgrimage. The 
skit follows the story of Zhu Bajie, the comical pig-
man disciple known for his laziness and gluttony, 
who must serve time tending to a temple after he 
commits a number of misdeeds.
While at the temple, Zhu Bajie, played by sophomore 
information systems major Daniel Song, forms a 
friendship with a taciturn girl named Huan Meiling,  
played by senior international relations and politics 
and Chinese studies double major Sandra Yeh, who 
is being hounded by literal demons. Bajie must also 
face harsh rebukes from the deified Chinese general 
Guan Yu, played by junior mechanical engineering 
and biomedical engineering double major Calvin 
Chan. The Monkey King also makes an appearance 
as a comically adorable version played by junior 
computer science major Joy Lin.
The skit had a number of humorous touches, 
including the use of “oh my Buddha” instead of 
“oh my God,” as well as a subplot about the Bandit 
Queen, who finds the Monkey King sexy, much to 
the dismay of her husband.
The skit also segued into the performances well, 
with each performance complementing a portion of 
the skit. The performances themselves surveyed the 
landscape of Chinese culture, from its ancient roots 
to modern times.
One of the best performances of the night included 
“You Know You Love Me, I’m Your Bad Boy,” a 
performance led by the Bandit King as he tried to 
impress his wife into loving him again. A dance to 
the song “Moonwalk” by Taiwanese boyband JPM, 
“I’m Your Bad Boy” was a smooth but energetic 
dance performance that showcased effects such as 
silhouette lighting. The dancing was choreographed 
well enough to be a music video for the actual song.
Its companion performance “Fragile Falling Flowers 
and Breakups,” was a graceful fan dance that 
touched on the same themes as “I’m Your Bad Boy.” 
Together, the two songs offered female and male 
perspectives on love and breakups. 
Also notable was the showing of Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus David Hsu’s (CIT ‘06) short film, “Fate,” 
about a girl who loses her boyfriend in a freak 
automobile accident, but gets a chance to reverse 
the death — at a price. The film features many 
Carnegie Mellon-centric locales and references. At 
one point, Hsu worked in a reference to The Last 
Lecture by Randy Pausch.
Many other performances also featured fan dancing, 
Chinese folk songs, and C-pop. The Ballroom Dance 
Club made an appearance in the performance “Toxic 
Tango,” a dance to the Britney Spears hit. At one 
part of the show, Princess Anna from Frozen teamed 
up with a sea deity to sing “Let Part of Your World 
Go,” a mashup of the hit songs from Frozen and The 
Little Mermaid.
The show also featured performances with uniquely 
Chinese instruments and objects, such as the 
Chinese yo-yo, the Chinese qin (a traditional 
stringed instrument), and lion dancing — dances 
in lion costumes traditionally performed during 
Chinese festivals.
One Night in Beijing was a show that brought 
together a multitude of talented performers from 
the Carnegie Mellon community and a variety of 
influences from Chinese culture. It was a great 
show for anyone with a connection to, or interest in, 
China.

Advice for awkward people
Dear advice columnist 
who seems to be a 
different person every 
week (what’s up with 
that?),
I’ve been trying to find 
anything at all to do 
instead of study for finals, 
and I mean anything: 
prank calling, volunteer 
work, and I even signed 
up for jury duty yesterday. 
Then I found out House 
was on Netflix, and 
any ray of hope for my 
academic adequacy is 
now gone. Should I even 
try to pass my finals?
Lazily yours,
Don’t Regret Whining, 
Instead Languid, Splayed 
Out, Noshing
Dear DR WILSON,
Well, first thing’s first: 
Watching all eight seasons 
of House should be your 
main priority. Jury duty can 
wait; if you’re watching 
five episodes a day, as you 
should be, that’s around 
when he’s admitted to a 
mental asylum, and there’s 
no way you can miss that 
arc. Oh, I’m sorry, were 
those spoilers? Whoops.
Also, why would you ever 
willingly sign up for jury 
duty? What could possibly 
be worse than ... oh, wait, 
you’re taking 251? Well, 
better bring a good book 
to the courtroom. If you’re 
feeling masochistic enough 
to volunteer for such 
excruciating experiences, 
I recommend Infinite Jest. 
Nice light reading.
Remember, it’s never 
lupus,
Evan
Dear guy,
It was 3 a.m. I was 
working on a PowerPoint 
on the Mac side of the 
CFA clusters. I thought 
I was the only person 
there, until I realized 
there was a really tall 
guy curled up into a ball 
in one of the blue swivel 
chairs. He was sleeping 
and snoring loudly 
enough to be really, really 
annoying. I didn’t wake 
him up this time, but 
what should I do if this 
happens again?
Sincerely,
Want to Unhinge Mouth 
of Precariously Uncoiling 
Snorer
Dear WUMPUS,
I wouldn’t do anything really 
mean — unless you’re 
morally bankrupt, in which 
case, by all means, take the 
risk and slap him awake, 
only to be knocked out by a 
likely member of the football 
team. Actually, wait; don’t 
do that. Even players on 
Carnegie Mellon’s football 
team have a little intimidation 
factor.
It’s probably best to put 
on your CFA headphones, 
blast some math rock, and 
pretend the snoring is just 
percussion.
Or dip his right hand in 
warm water, then go to 
Hunt,
Evan

It’s one thing to read that Carnegie Mellon’s School of 
Music is one of the top undergraduate music programs 
in the country; it’s another to hear the product of student 
work come to life on stage. On Wednesday, the Carnegie 
Mellon Philharmonic graced Carnegie Music Hall with 
impressive performances across the board. Beginning 
with a roaring Ruslan and Ludmila, moving into a 
showcase of solo talent, and concluding with the epic 
Shostakovich 5, the orchestra rose to the challenge of a 
broad and well-rehearsed program.
The orchestra launched the evening with a breakneck 
rendition of Mikhail Glinka’s notoriously fast Ruslan and 
Ludmila Overture. Conductor Andrés Cárdenes took a 
very laid-back style in leading the orchestra in this ?rst 
piece. After his ?rst cue, he leaned back, conducting 
with nothing but an occasional bob of the head or twitch 
of the ?ngers. Surprisingly, the orchestra maintained a 
reasonable tempo on its own, staying a uni?ed body and 
resisting the ever-present temptation to speed up to the 
point of total cacophony.
The phrasing was cloudy at moments, but overall 
sharp and uni?ed, and the cellos were simply beautiful 
when they took the limelight with their sweeping 
melody, wringing every ounce of tenderness from 
each bar without slowing the tempo. The Glinka 
proved an excellent choice for an opener: It infused the 
performance with energy right from the start and elicited 
cheers from the audience.
The evening also showcased Carnegie Mellon’s solo 
talent: After the Glinka, the musicians rearranged their 
seats to make room for Krzysztof Rucinski, a master’s 
student in violin performance and the highlight of the 
second part of the program. He chose to play Karol 
Szymanowski’s Violin Concerto No. 1 — a piece written 
in 1916 and often considered one of the ?rst modern 
violin concertos, for immediately obvious reasons: The 
piece is beautiful but atonal, departing from traditional 
compositions of the form.
At ?rst appearance, Rucinski did not have a particularly 
emotive or even charismatic stage presence. Many 
concert soloists naturally try to charm their audience or 
make a show of chemistry with the conductor. Rucinski 
crossed the stage wearing all black, only modestly 
acknowledging the applause that greeted him. All that 
changed, however, when the music started. When 
Rucinski lowered his violin during the extended breaks 
between passages, he lifted his head up as if in wonder, 
eyes shining — as if he were drinking in the music for 
the ?rst time. At times, he closed his eyes, as if shutting 
off his vision would enhance his hearing that much 
more.
Rucinski’s playing itself was ?awed at points, but 
overall it was exquisite. His eerie, beautiful ?rst notes 
were made tender and haunting by a ?uid, effortlessly 
quavering vibrato. Rucinski sometimes lacked the 
volume for his sound to rise over the clamoring orchestra, 
but his playing was no less forceful for it; during grittier 
passages, Rucinski seemed to rage at the music, digging 
recklessly into the strings — and snapping a few bow 
hairs in the process.
After a long intermission, the full orchestra took the 
stage again for Dmitri Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5. 
While not technically dif?cult, the symphony is one of 
the composer’s better-known works, and an ambitious 
choice given its historical context. Symphony No. 5 was 
Shostakovich’s response to criticism and intimidation 
by Stalin himself and his associates in 1930s Russia. 
While overtly patriotic — the piece gained wide acclaim 
from Stalinist authorities upon its premiere — it is 
now generally understood that Symphony No. 5 was 
Shostakovich’s subtly seditious effort to make realist 
commentary on the suffering of the Russian people while 
appeasing Stalin’s regime and avoiding arrest himself. 
It is a depiction of forced celebration: the appearance 
of patriotism, with a strong undertone of turmoil and 
suffering tainting the happy picture.
From Wednesday’s performance, it was clear that 
the orchestra did not take this challenge lightly: The 
musicians gave the piece the gravity and attention 
it deserves. Clocking in at roughly 45 minutes, the 
symphony isn’t a short one — but the musicians 
maintained energy and a high quality of performance 
throughout. The well-rehearsed moments in the 
performance were apparent in the clear, uni?ed phrasing 
and well-coordinated, broad range of dynamics. The 
performance held a wide range of moments, from fragile, 
creepily soft spider-web passages to roaring crescendos 
that tumbled into furious musical chaos. At times, the 
piece reached very brief but deafening peaks of volume, 
characterized by a ?erce rumbling of the timpani.
Cárdenes, too, was especially animated throughout the 
Shostakovich in contrast to his approach to the Glinka. It 
seemed he had been saving his energy all night for that 
last 45 minutes. During particularly energetic passages, 
he shook his ?st at the orchestra, as if threatening them 
with violence if they didn’t play loud enough.
The piece concluded with a racing fourth movement, 
which mellowed into a full, round sound that carried 
the triumphant — or despairing — last minutes of the 
symphony into a grand swell of an ending. Immediately 
after the musicians lowered their instruments, the 
audience leapt into a full standing ovation.

The semester is ?nally wrapping up, and it’s time to 
start thinking about summer. Many students choose 
to remain in the Pittsburgh area to take classes, work 
at an internship in the city, conduct research, or just 
for convenience. Music lovers who choose to remain in 
Pittsburgh this summer are in luck — there is a great 
lineup of concerts coming to the Steel City. There are 
many more concerts than the ones listed here and likely 
many more to be announced in the future; these are just 
the highlights.
Neon Trees
May 14
Kick off the summer with a bang at a Neon Trees 
concert. You’ve heard their songs “Animal,” “Everybody 
Talks,” and their latest single, “Sleeping With A Friend” 
on the radio. Now hear them live. This tour celebrates 
the release of their latest album, Pop Psychology. In 
addition to the upbeat, danceable music, lead singer 
Tyler Glenn is a high-energy performer with great dance 
moves and a knack for putting on an entertaining show. 
The Neon Trees will be at Stage AE on the last day of 
?nals.
Ingrid Michaelson 
May 25
Want to hear great live music but don’t want all of the 
chaos of a typical concert? Then Ingrid Michaelson’s 
sweet, indie-pop tunes and smooth vocals are the 
right choice for you. Her music has the ability to make 
listeners feel like they’re curled up in a fuzzy blanket 
with a cup of hot cocoa and a puppy in their lap. For a 
nice alternative to the typical concert, check out Ingrid 
Michaelson at Stage AE.
Backstreet Boys and Avril Lavigne 
June 14
Backstreet’s back, and there’s nothing complicated 
about it. Take a trip down memory lane at this concert. 
The Backstreet Boys are celebrating 21 years together 
with their “In A World Like This” summer tour. Avril 
Lavigne will be performing new songs in addition to the 
classics we all know and love from 2002. For a nostalgic 
and fun concert, head out to the First Niagara Pavilion.
Arctic Monkeys and White Denim
June 17 
For music enthusiasts with a special preference for indie 
rock and a soft spot for English men, the Arctic Monkeys 
are the perfect band. They will make this international 
summer tour in support of their ?fth and most recent 
album, AM. Similarly to the Arctic Monkeys, White 
Denim is a four-piece indie rock band. This band from 
Texas has a unique sound drawn from dub, psychedelic 
rock, blues, progressive rock, soul, jazz, and experimental 
rock. This concert at Stage AE promises to be a great 
show for fans of alternative music.
Tegan and Sara
June 19
Tegan and Sara, a sister band, are one of those bands 
that sound even better live than they do on the radio. 
Most well-known for their single on the radio, “Closer,” 
these girls are anything but super?cial pop stars. Their 
lyrics are powerful and evocative, and they pour tons of 
emotion and energy into all of their performances. Not to 
mention, breaks between songs are ?lled with humorous 
banter between Tegan, Sara, and the audience. If you’re 
looking for a high-energy concert with charismatic 
performers, check out Tegan and Sara at Stage AE.
Monumentour: Fall Out Boy & Paramore
July 3
This concert promises to be exactly what the title of the 
tour implies: monumental. This is one of those concerts 
where both acts will keep you excited, dancing, and 
enthusiastic from start to ?nish. With Fall Out Boy’s 
recent album, Save Rock and Roll, and Paramore’s recent 
self-titled album, these two bands are sure to put on a 
great performance featuring many fresh songs, as well 
as familiar songs from earlier in their careers. Check out 
the bands you fell in love with in middle school that are 
somehow still making great music for you to rock out to 
on the radio at the First Niagara Pavilion.
Paul McCartney
July 7
An oldie but a goodie, no explanation is really needed for 
why Paul McCartney would put on a great show. For 
those not impressed by his accomplishments already, at 
least give the man credit for continuing to put on high 
energy performances even though he’s not as young as 
he once was. If your heart lies with classic rock music, 
check out this iconic star at the Consol Energy Center.
Katy Perry 
July 22
Fun fact: Teenage Dream was the ?rst album by a female 
artist to have ?ve number-one hits. This ?rework has 
tons of achievements and honors under her tiny belt 
for her fun, catchy tunes. However, her latest album 
Prism features darker music with more self-empowering 
themes. For a little taste of girl power and a lot of fun, go 
to the Consol Energy Center.
Jason Aldean, Tyler Farr, Miranda Lambert, & 
Florida Georgia Line
July 26 
If you are a country fan, this concert should sound like 
heaven — four well-known country stars will come 
together in one night for what promises to be an 
awesome concert and a fun time. The location is great 
too — PNC Park is a great location and a beautiful park 
that offers a spectacular view of the rivers. Get all your 
best pals together and head downtown to PNC Park for 
a night of good old-fashioned country music. Just don’t 
forget your cowboy hat.
Panic! at the Disco
August 1
Looking for an alternative concert with upbeat, dance-
inducing music? Look no further than Panic! at the 
Disco. If that isn’t enticing enough, attractive lead singer 
Brendon Urie’s fancy footwork, which includes back?ips, 
should be a solid reason to attend. Urie isn’t just all show, 
however. He wrote almost every song on the newest 
album, Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die, about his best 
friend who struggled with a drug addiction. Check out 
this fun concert with a deeper, complex meaning behind 
the lyrics at Stage AE.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for the Parks and 
Recreaton season six ?nale, “Moving Up.”
Pawnee, Ind. is far from perfect. The people are rude 
and morbidly obese; the infrastructure is crumbling and 
prone to raccoon infestations. But despite all its ?aws, 
former City Councilwoman and Deputy Director of the 
Pawnee City Department of Parks and Recreation Leslie 
Knope (Amy Poehler) loves Pawnee with a ?erce passion.
What would Pawnee be without her? More importantly, 
who would Leslie be without Pawnee? Last Thursday, 
Parks and Recreation played with those questions in its 
season six ?nale, “Moving Up.”
There were a lot of storylines going into this ?nale, 
which could have made even the extra 20 minutes feel 
crammed with content, but the writers managed to 
merge them into one cohesive storyline.
The NBC comedy saw Leslie tackle all sorts of new 
obstacles this season: the recall election, the pregnancy 
and subsequent exit of her best friend Ann Perkins 
(Rashida Jones), and the merger between Pawnee and 
its neighbor and rival city, Eagleton.
The last few episodes took the show to a new level, as it 
was revealed that Leslie and husband Ben Wyatt (Adam 
Scott) are expecting triplets — the always-overachieving 
Leslie had even managed to overachieve a family.
To top it off, Leslie was still mulling over a major job 
offer from the National Parks Service that would require 
a move to Chicago. It was only halfway through the 
episode that Leslie decided to take the job, which left 
about 20 minutes for viewers to wonder how the show 
was going to progress next season.
In fact, much of the episode felt like a series, rather than 
a season, ?nale, as all the characters examined their own 
lives and voiced their appreciation of them. This show 
depends heavily on its supporting cast for humor and 
actual storylines, so any major decisions made by Leslie 
need to be examined in terms of everyone else.
Set against the Pawnee-Eagleton Unity Concert, 
“Moving Up” saw Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) reaf?rm 
his commitment to family life, while April Ludgate 
(Aubrey Plaza) and Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) reaf?rm 
their status as the most perfectly dysfunctional couple 
on TV.
Meanwhile, former Parks employee Tom Haverford (Aziz 
Ansari) ?nally opens  his newest business venture, 
Tom’s Bistro, with some help from his friends, some 
Pawnee celebrities, and some actual celebrities. After 
a few hiccups, the restaurant actually turns out to be a 
success.
Parks and Recreation has always been an 
underappreciated comedy. Despite continuous threat of 
cancelation, the whole team manages to turn out quality, 
heartfelt episodes every week.
This week was no exception. It was nice after a season 
that sometimes felt like a downer to see everyone 
legitimately happy in their lives.
Even moves that could seem like cop-outs, such as 
Leslie convincing her new boss to move the Chicago 
operation to Pawnee, manage to come off as the most 
natural thing in the world. Of course Leslie would 
manage to move up in the world without ever having to 
move out of Pawnee.
And despite the episode’s overarching tone of ?nality, 
the ?nal two minutes ?rmly close out this season and 
simultaneously push the show into the next, and 
possibly ?nal, season.
A three-year time jump gives the writers room to 
jump head ?rst into Leslie’s new roles, both personal 
and professional, without having to deal with all the 
transitions.
It’s nice to see a show grow and develop while still 
maintaining everything that makes it great. Parks and 
Recreation is consistently funny and entertaining, but 
continues to ?nd new ways to make a small town in 
Indiana seem like the best place in the world.

In one of the most iconic ?lms ever, the Pythonites return to help King Arthur in his quest to ?nd the Holy Grail. What ensues are anachronistic 
characters, Trojan rabbits, and crazy musical numbers that somehow create one of the funniest ?lms of all time. Directed by the brilliant Terry Gilliam, 
Monty Python and the Holy Grail  is a hysterical yet twisted take on Camelot that is highly imaginative and inspired. Warning: you might suffer from

The voices of young Pittsburgh artists rang out over 
the College of Fine Arts lawn this past Saturday in a 
combination of rap and hip-hop songs. They belonged to 
the participants of Arts Greenhouse, a hip-hop education 
program for Pittsburgh teenagers that is af?liated with 
Carnegie Mellon. The students come to campus every 
Saturday from September to April to practice making 
music and to record their songs in CFA’s basement 
recording studios. 
During the performance, students in Arts Greenhouse 
showcased their work from this semester. There was also 
a cookout with free food for anyone who came to watch. 
The soundcheck took a few minutes, and the Arts 
Greenhouse students wandered around the CFA steps, 
sometimes participating in the soundcheck, but mainly 
talking and joking with each other. 
One of the goals of the program is to foster community 
between the high school students themselves, and it 
seems to have succeeded in that goal. Khalil Sellers, a 
senior at The Neighborhood Academy, said “[Being in 
Arts Greenhouse] de?nitely impacted my life. These 
guys are my best friends. We’re always hanging out, 
making music. I’m always collabing with these guys.” 
Sellers goes by the stage name K.I.P. and plans to pursue 
music as a full-time career, though he plans to move to 
Denver after graduating high school to work in design. 
Other students concurred with Sellers’s sentiments. 
Naomi Dowden, a sophomore at the Barack Obama 
Academy of International Studies, said, “I really like the 
atmosphere. All these people have the same passion, 
music.... It’s an open environment that I can escape 
to.” Dowden occasionally sings, but her main focus is 
songwriting. She stated that being in Arts Greenhouse 
helped her discover her talents. “It made me realize 
the talent I have inside me. It made me realize I always 
want writing to be a part of my life,” she said. After high 
school, Dowden plans to attend college in New York City 
and pursue a career in acting.
After the soundcheck ended, the performances began. 
The ?rst two songs, “Groovin” and “AG’s Diner,” 
featured many different students collaborating together. 
“Groovin” showcased Dowden, Sellers, Allie Rose, Sovren 
Gray, and Imani Jai Chisom, while “AG’s Diner” featured 
Dowden, Chisom, Rose, Gray, Arthur King, and Hussein 
Salim. The students were all talented, and the two songs 
started off the performances well because they both had 
good rhythms.
Though the group songs were quite good, the 
individually performed songs that followed were even 
better. Sellers was up ?rst, performing an original song 
called “Love Jones.” Sellers had good stage presence and 
got his audience to sing along with him, keeping them 
engaged and entertained.
Next up was Obama Academy sophomore Imani Jai 
Chisom. She also performed an original song, called “Mr. 
Cigarette.” As Chisom walked up to the microphone, 
she said, “This song is called ‘Mr. Cigarette.’ I don’t 
support cigarettes, though.” Only a few seconds into 
her song, the wind that had been blowing through the 
crowd pushed her skirt up. Chisom was clearly ?ustered, 
but recovered gracefully as her Arts Greenhouse peers 
encouraged her to sit down and keep singing. So she sat 
on the stone CFA steps and restarted her song. She had 
a truly enchanting voice that stood out even among her 
talented peers, and even though she may not personally 
endorse cigarettes, she sang about them with a lovely 
kind of longing.
Another standout performance followed Chisom’s, 
given by City Charter High School sophomore Montell 
Frazier. Frazier is a rapper and producer and goes by the 
stage name Cargo FL. He performed his latest single, 
called “Bad Guys.” He rapped with a soulful intensity, 
occasionally stretching his arms out to the crowd. “Bad 
Guys,” among some of Frazier’s other work, is available 
to listen to on SoundCloud. 
After the last individual performance — Taylor Allderdice 
High School junior Sovren Gray performing a song called 
“FUBU” — the show returned to a more collaborative 
format, with four to ?ve students up on the steps at any

given time. All the while, the students who were not 
performing stood before the steps in a tight knot, smiling 
and calling encouragement to their friends. When 
performers entreated them to put their hands in the air 
or sing along, they did so with more enthusiasm than 
anyone else watching. They ?lmed each other with their 
phones and took pictures to immortalize the moment. 
Eventually, the scheduled songs came to an end, but the 
students performed more pieces, including a rap battle. 
“These kids are like every other teenager,” said Arts 
Greenhouse co-founder Riccardo Schulz, an assistant 
teaching professor in the School of Music. “Except — 
they’re polite. They don’t say ‘like’ after ever other word. 
They relate well to adults, and they’re not self-conscious 
about that. They are also very supportive of each other.” 
Schulz co-founded Arts Greenhouse with history 
professor Judith Schachter 12 years ago. Schulz said 
that he wanted to ful?ll a community need. “I decided 
it would be a good thing to share with the community. 
There are a lot of young folks who have talent, but no 
place to record.”
Schulz also stated that he wanted to give Carnegie 
Mellon engineers the opportunity to interact with 
people from the greater Pittsburgh community, as well 
as inspire local teens to pursue higher education. “I 
wanted to help teenagers ?nd their identity and give 
them the idea that college is not out of their reach. Yes, 
you can apply to college. You could go to college,” he 
said. He spoke of senior business administration major 
Kai Roberts, a former participant and current mentor of 
Arts Greenhouse, as an example of an Arts Greenhouse 
student who decided to pursue higher education at 
Carnegie Mellon.  
Roberts isn’t the only current Carnegie Mellon student 
involved in Arts Greenhouse. Several students from 
history professor Nico Slate’s Sustainable Social Change 
class have become involved with the program this 
past semester. These students include sophomore 
global studies and human-computer interaction double 
major Lucy Pei, junior global studies and professional 
writing double major Alexandria Hernandez, sophomore 
economics, statistics, and global studies triple major 
Jillian Ward, junior architecture and global studies 
double major Andrea Saloman, and senior global studies 
major Christian Manoli. Pei and Saloman work on 
student pro?les and publicizing the organization, while 
Hernandez teaches spoken-word poetry.
“The kids are really passionate in a way that’s beyond 
their years,” Hernandez said. “It’s inspiring to work 
with them, not for them. They really teach alongside 
me.” Manoli shared this sentiment, saying, “I like Arts 
Greenhouse because it transcends the traditional 
classroom. The students are the teachers, and we’re the 
students. We talk about a plethora of issues, from politics 
to music.... The passion is really what draws me.”
This environment of passion drew many Arts 
Greenhouse students, and many of the students spoke 
about how Arts Greenhouse has made them feel safe 
and free to explore their natural talents. Malaisha 
Thompson, a sophomore at Obama Academy, said, “I 
like the freedom that we have. Every song is just ours. 
Well, it’s AG’s, but it’s ours.” Another Obama Academy 
sophomore, Jada Lowe, said “It’s a cool environment. 
There’s no judgment here; you’re here to just be free.” 
Feeling safe is an important part of a healthy teenage 
experience, and that comfort is especially important for 
artistic pursuits. Arts Greenhouse gives talented local 
teens the space and the means to expand their abilities 
— sometimes abilities that they didn’t even know they 
had — while simultaneously allowing Carnegie Mellon 
students to interact with Pittsburgh residents in a more 
intimate way. Next spring semester, take a break from 
?nals preparation and check out an amazing community 
collaboration that produces some quality music.

Greenhouse project hang out in front of the CFA building after their concert.

pillbox 04.28.14
Kresge Theatre was abuzz on Friday afternoon in 
anticipation of a special guest talk. The last time this 
guest was in Pittsburgh, it was 1964, not long before his 
works began to gain popularity. Since the 1960s, this 
man has been a major ?gure in propelling classical music 
to an entirely new world.
Musical celebrity Philip Glass shuf?ed on stage a few 
minutes late to tumultuous applause. He walked with 
the slow ease of a man in his later years, and greeted 
the audience with the familiarity of a musician who is 
no stranger to the stage. His casual mannerisms and 
modest attire did not indicate his fame for composing 
beloved compositions such as Einstein on the Beach, 10 
symphonies, and a series of operas, nor that he’d won 
a Golden Globe and has been nominated for several 
Academy Awards for his ?lm scores.
Richard Randall, assistant professor of music theory 
and researcher in the College of Fine Arts, followed the 
composer on stage and began the conversation. Glass 
was witty, comfortable, and likably straightforward in his 
answers. He admitted how he changed concentrations 
at The Juilliard School from ?ute to composition 
because, frankly, he was better at the latter. He insisted 
that, although some of his most famous works contain 
electronics, he still adheres to a pencil and paper for 
composing.
When speaking about hearing one of his early pieces on 
the radio whilst in Pittsburgh, he casually remarked, “It 
wasn’t as bad as I thought it was.” Glass continued to 
display remarkable modesty throughout the interview, 
most notably when Randall acknowledged his role in 
creating the tonal, repetitive, and easily accessible 
genre of classical music called minimalism. Rather 
than accepting this credit, Glass argued that he was 
not the only composer moving toward something new 
at the time, and that it was the culture as a whole that 
demanded classical music move to a new place.
Regardless of what Glass claimed he did, the effect he 
has had on classical music is enormous. Even Pittsburgh 
has felt his in?uence: Nancy Galbraith, composer and 
professor of composition at Carnegie Mellon, writes 
music tinged with recurring motifs and crystalline 
harmonies reminiscent of Glass’s style, and the Carnegie 
Library has more early Glass scores than virtually any 
other library in the world.
As the interview continued, Glass revealed a knack for 
dropping unexpectedly wise advice in such a nonchalant 
way that one could easily miss it. On the subject of never 
turning down opportunities to work, he commented, 
“You don’t get anything from saying ‘no.’ It didn’t 
hurt Bach, it won’t hurt you.” He exhibited awareness 
of the legacy he will leave — as well as a sensible 
understanding, acquired from a lifetime of composing 
— that “very few things live beyond the maturity of the 
artist.” In his opinion, composers will always ?nd their 
distinct sound. “Losing your voice is the hard part,” he 
said. “You’ll be working on that for the rest of your life.”
Witnessing a cherished composer speak of his 
own music in an era that acknowledges him for his 
contribution is a rare and precious occasion. It was 
especially relevant to the performers in attendance, 
who were able to get a ?rsthand understanding of what 
exactly the composer wanted. Glass described how 
separating notes into their respective measures can 
get in the way of the music-making; he sees his music 
as grouped into twos and threes instead. He explained 
how rhythmic structure is the ultimate driving factor in 
his compositions. His compositions often don’t contain 
any clear melody. Content is not Glass’s strength (or 
perhaps content is simply not his point), but rather it is 
the overall form and the progression of one section to the 
next that he focuses on, causing the listener to feel like 
they’ve gone on some sort of ambiguous journey.
The audience had a chance to experience this journey 
?rsthand as the interview portion drew to a close and 
the Matisse String Quartet, the School of Music’s honors 
string quartet, took the stage. Made up of graduate and 
postgraduate students, they played a clear, engaging 
rendition of “Glass String Quartet No. 5,” one of the 
gems of Glass’s chamber music repertoire. The piece is 
bookended by an elegy-like theme and ?lled in with walls 
of lively harmony driven forward by perpetual rhythms. 
It is head-bobbing music, but with subtle changes here 
and there that make it impossible to predict when the 
head should bob.
Needless to say, Kresge Theatre was swept along for 
the ride as the student ensemble deftly and artfully 
executed the piece. The cellist, master’s student in 
cello performance Marlene Ballena, and violist, master’s 
student in viola performance Si Yu, were the soul of this 
performance. They played synonymously in articulation 
and color, and weren’t afraid to drive the quartet 
forward. While the upper strings didn’t quite achieve the 
same blended sound as their counterparts, there was no 
mistaking the brilliance of their performance.
The audience was quick to enthusiastially applaud. The 
de?ning moment occurred when Glass himself walked 
onto the stage to shake the hands of the students, 
smiling widely. He seemed immensely pleased with 
their performance. Seeing the ?ve of them bow together 
offered a rare and special moment of unity between a 
renowned composer and student performers.

Take a 10-minute walk: Walking helps clear your head 
and boosts endorphins, which reduces stress hormones. 
Consider walking somewhere with lots of vegetation. Trees 
naturally release chemicals that boost your immune system 
and relieve stress.
taurus
april 20–may 20
Try doing some yoga: Breaking exercises help you relax 
and reduce the built up tension and stress. Yoga is 
characterized by deep breathing, as opposed to shallow 
breathing that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, 
which creates stress.
gemini
may 21–june 21
Eat a snack: Stress-eating isn’t always a bad thing. The 
gut-brain axis is the connection between the gut and the 
brain — more and more researchers have produced data 
that pegs the gut as a major mediator of stress response.

Buy yourself a plant: Houseplants don’t just beautify a

Put on some music: While classical music has a particularly

acid that gives the tea flavor and promotes relaxation. It 
counteracts the stimulating effects of caffeine that can 
worsen stress response.

Open the window: Just looking out your window can have 
a relaxing effect. Looking out at a city landscape or a nature 
scene slows down your heart rate. It’s a lot more effective 
than looking at a picture — the brain is not so easily fooled.

Work out: Working out is a great way to take a bite out of 
tension. When you are mentally tired, intense exercise can 
make you more stressed. Light-to-moderate exercise won’t 
improve your fitness, but will lighten your mood.
