CMU students arrested
By EDWARD HAYES
Con.Fe stintF fSpr -«.nVi
William Motley, a Senior 
Civil Engineering student, and 
’SS Hester, a Junior Mechani­
cal Engineer, two CMU stu­
dents, were placed under cus­
todial arrest last Sunday night 
for disorderly conduct and ob­
structing traffic at the inter­
section of Forbes and 
Morewood Avenues.
Two Campus officers were 
patrolling the fraternity quad 
when they spotted the suspects 
in front of the quad shouting 
jbscenities at each other. The 
officers warned the two to calm 
town. The men responded with 
jirther obscenities at the offic­
ers.
Motley allegedly chased 
Hester and then started fight­
ing with him. The brawl spilled 
rat into the middle of Forbes.
Traffic was obstructed during the 
melee.
The officers once again at­
tempted to break up the fight. 
“The students refused to stop for 
Campus Police,” said Jim 
LaPaglia, Chief of Campus Po­
lice. The suspects then allegedly 
ran on to the Cut where the offic­
ers arrested the students and 
brought them downtown.
Motley and Hester declined to 
comment on the situation. Both 
men are members of Spirit, and 
the group’s Vice President, Xavier 
Cain, feared that there may have 
been some other motivation be­
hind the arrest. “It upset a lot of 
people,” he said, “It’s a consider­
ation that the whole campus 
should worry about.”
LaPaglia disputed any claim 
that the arrest was racially bi­
ased, “The outcome of this inci­
dent was solely the responsibil­
ity of the students.”
He went on to say, “Under 
similar circumstances, stu­
dents have been arrested re­
gardless of race.”
Cain said that Motley and 
Hester were upset about the 
arrest and felt a misjustice was 
made. “Our organization sup­
ports them [and hopes they] 
get justice.” LaPaglia main­
tains the fault lies with the two 
students, “Whenever we have a 
student or nonstudents refus­
ing to stop we have to take 
them into custody,” he said, 
“The last thing we want to do is 
arrest students. Our purpose is 
to provide safety and security 
for students.”
Motley and Hester were re­
leased on bonds later that 
evening. They face a prelimi­
nary hearing October 4 before 
the district magistrate. The stu­
dents are both 21 and will be 
tried as adults.
Freshman dies of meningococcemia
By EDWARD HAYES

Joseph Gordon, 17, a freshman 
H&SS student, died Friday af­
ternoon at Montefiore Hospital 
of meningococcemia, a bacteria 
of meningitis.
Gordon collapsed in his 
Morewood Gardens room around 
midnight, Thursday night and 
was immediately rushed to 
Montefiore. His head was swol­
len and he was placed in critical 
condition.
Gordon had gone to Health Ser­
vices earlier that day complain­
ing of nausea, diarrhea and head­
aches. “He had no fever, no rash, 
just a very mild headache,” said 
Anita Barkin, Director of Health 
Services. “He felt better when he 
left. He started to deteriorate later

that evening,” said Barkin.
When Gordon was taken to the 
hospital, his parents were quickly 
informed. His father flew in from 
Margate, Florida to be with his 
son.
Early Friday afternoon, memo­
randums by Barkin were posted 
all over campus to warn students 
about the infection. Soon after, 
came Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy’s letter inform­
ing the student body that Gordon 
had died that afternoon in the 
presence of his father and close 
friends.
Gordon was a member of Spirit 
and the men’s soccer team. “He 
was a person I respected and ad­
mired,” said Xavier Cain, vice 
president of Spirit, “We never 
really got a chance to watch him 
grow.” Nick Gaudioso, the men’s 
soccer coach had similar feelings, 
“He was a great kid,” he said, “He 
wasn’t your average [17] year old. 
He was a really good student and 
went to every practice.”

narily by the Carnegie Institute of 
echnology, but will include features 
°r the whole campus community to 
njoy.
Roberts Hall will ultimately house 
he work that is going on in the de- 
wtments °f Material Science and 
¡ngineering, Electrical and Computer 
®gineering, and Chemical Engineer­
's that center on Electronic Materi- 
s and their application,” said 
When Director, Dean of CIT.
R e University has hired the archi- 
1 cture firm of Payett Associates, Inc. 
Jut of Boston, and project and design 
"jlans have been developing for two 
Fars. The building will be located 
'rectly behind Hammerschlag Hall
1 ’,vill be built into the steep hill.
Roberts Hall (named for the primary 
donor, CIT alumnus George A. Roberts) 
will be 72,000 square feet with five floors 
and is expected to open in the Spring of 
1996.
Three floors will be used as labs and 
office space, the bottom floor for receiv­
ing facilities, and the top floor a multi­
purpose auditorium. This addition to 
the building comes at a time when there 
is a “real need for large rooms here,” said 
Paul Tellers, the University Architect. 
This auditorium will be fully equipped 
with audiovisuals equipment, and will 
seat 150 people.
When the building opens it “will have 
three and half floors,” said Director. 
“During the initial phase of construction 
only about two and a half floors will be 
complete. The remainder of the building 
will have to be completed after addi­
tional funds have been raised.”
Director said that the first group of 
occupants “will primarily be those who’s 
interests focus in the data storage area." 
Their concentration is in applications 
such as: focusing on magnetic and mag­
neto-optic materials and applications. 
The building will also house the Data 
Storage Systems Center, which is one of 
the two National Science Engineering 
Research Centers that CMU has. Direc­
tor said that “there are about 20 such 
NSF Engineering Research Centers in 
the country and we are the only univer­
sity to have two of them.”
Roberts Hallis very similar to some­
thing that original Carnegie Tech Ar­
chitect Henry Hombostal might have 
designed. Because Roberts Hall is 
behind CMUs primary building, Tell­
ers said the architects were “very care­
ful in its design.” They wanted to 
“make it relate to its environment.” 
Roberts Hall will be made of concrete 
because of its location on the steep 
slope. Concrete, said Tellers, is “an 
economical way to structure the build­
ing.”
All Americans with Disabilities Act 
rules will be followed and the building 
will be fully accessible to handicapped 
persons. One of the main features of 
the building will be its accessibility to 
Hammerschlag and Scaife Halls. Rob­
erts will have a bridge connection to 
Hammerschlag over the road to con­
nect with Hammerschlag’s Clean 
Room. There will also be a new and 
improved road and pedestrian con­
nections to Scaife.
Some have questioned the move to 
build Roberts literally on a cliff. But 
as Tellers said there are “very few 
sites left on an urban campus without 
taking up green space.” Also, Roberts’ 
location is near ClT, their adminis­
tration and offices, and their profes­
sors and instructors.
Behind Hamiherschlag is also the

‘The Yard’ results come in
By MAX CHOTTSTER
stintF OPF.Vi 0nt""pi.nSi
According to new Director of Dining 
Services Mark Hamlin, Dining Services 
is “moving ahead with the plans” to 
reopen Scotland Yard.
A planning meeting was held on Mon­
day September 26, at which members of 
GSL, SDC, and Student Government 
were present. One item on the agenda 
was Scotland Yard. The results of the 
survey which were taken at the Septem­
ber 22 students’ meeting were presented 
by student body president Declan 
McCullagh.
The survey of approximately 90 stu­
dents indicates that students prefer op­
erating hours of 6 PM to 2 AM. Morewood 
was definitely the preferred location, 
gaining 77 of the 90 votes. Only 9 stu­
dents polled prefer to have the Yard be 
all smoking, while 26 prefer nonsmok­
ing, 39 prefer a mix of the two, and 15 do 
not care. Somewhat surprisingly, 29 
freshman and 32 sophomores were 
present at the students; meeting, com­
pared to 17 juniors and 6 seniors. The 
survey indicated that students are very
concerned about the Yard’s hours of op­
eration, atmosphere, and food quality, 
and less concerned about the size and 
location of the Yard.
Freshman Jessica Connoly, a Fresh­
man, H&SS student, feels that the food 
is the most important thing about the 
Yard. “Yougethungry when other places 
are closed, so it’s nice to have someplace 
to go eat.”
Mike Wall,a freshman math student, 
disagrees. “That’s what made the whole 
thing before, the atmosphere. That’s 
what brought students in.”
According to Hamlin, there will be a 
“food committee”, under whose jurisdic­
tion planning for Scotland Yard will fall. 
The committee will be coordinated by 
Michael Rosenthal, chairman of the SDC 
dining committee.
Rosenthal is in the process of forming 
a special Scotland Yard committee. The 
date of reopening, the menu, and the 
decoration have not been decided upon. 
These details will be left up to the stu­
dents. There will be “a lot of informa­
tional meetings and surveys so we find 
out what students want in Scotland 
Yard,” Rosenthal stated.

Five people killed in 
Haitian peace rally
JACMEL, Haiti, September 30 (D J)
— Under the protection of U.S. sol­
diers, life in Haiti, has been changing 
by the day.
In the rest of the country, as in this 
rundown seacoast town, where the 
vast majority of Haitians support 
President Aristide and his policy for 
change.
Haitians have been breathing more 
freely. Many have been coming out of 
the shadows, demonstrating and cel­
ebrating, no longer fearing the hated 
military.
But even with thousands of U.S. 
troops nearby, life is dangerous. Yes­
terday, as pro-democracy demonstra­
tors marched through the capital to 
celebrate the reinstatement of Evans 
Paul, the mayor of Port-au-Prince, a 
grenade was tlirown into a crowd.
At least five people were killed, and 
more than 40 were wounded. Eyewit­
nesses to the incident, which occurred 
next to some of the city’s worst slums, 
say U.S. troops looking for the perpe­
trators shot open the metal door of a 
warehouse and dragged out one man. 
Three men eventually were detained. 
Haitians at the scene said those de­
tained were Haitian military and plain 
clothes police officers.
After the incident, ragged slum 
dwellers looted the warehouse, which 
held building materials and which 
they said belongs to Col. Michel 
Francois, the head of the Port-au- 
Prince police.
After ignoring the looting, U.S. mili­
tary police finally intervened after 
the crowd broke into a neighboring 
auto-repair shop.
Death toll reaches 900
TURKU, Finland (Sept. 29) — Sal­
vage workers tried using sophisticated 
electronic equipment to search the Bal­
tic Sea for the wreck of the Estonia. 
There was little success Thursday, as 
the death toll from the ferry disaster 
topped 900.
The violent waters were problems for 
the investigators who had hoped for a 
chance to use a highly-sophisticated ro­
bot to examine the wreck and locate 
bodies.
Also, because of the upcoming winter, 
any attempts to raise the ship up will 
have to be postponed until next year, 
according to Finnish news.
On Thursday, bodies were still bob­
bing to the surface of the wind-whipped 
waters. The heavy seas drove back sal­
vage workers who were trying to locate 
the vessel that capsized and sank in a 
storm on Wednesday.
Helicopters and ships from Finland 
and Sweden continued to crisscross the 
area where the Estonia sank. Rescuers 
weren’t expecting to find any more sur­
vivors of one of the world’s worst mari­
time disasters. The water temperature 
was 46 degrees.
Investigations began Thursday into 
the cause of the disaster, which killed at 
least 909 people, according to the latest 
provisional figures.
Another 140 people were confirmed 
rescued. The number of people on board 
is still uncertain. The police did say
Thursday that they received an updated 
list from Estonian authorities that raised 
the number on board to 1,047. After a 
brief ceremony Thursday, 41 bodies were 
removed from a makeshift morgue on 
the island of Uto. The unknown bodies 
were then put on a ferry for the main­
land, where they were to be taken to 
Helsinki for identification.
An Estonian-led board of inquiry was 
expected to focus on the seals on the 
ship’s front door. A surviving ship’s en­
gineer said water began pouring through 
the door about a half hour before the 
ferry went down.
“We will try first by robot to identify 
the problems,” said rescue director Raimo 
Tiilikainen, at the operation’s headquar­
ters in Turku.
“After an analysis and the investiga­
tion, we hope to draw up a picture of 
what happened.”
Salvage workers may try to eventu­
ally raise the ferry from the bottom of 
the sea.“There are very strong pressures 
to raise it, for investigation purposes 
and human interest because of victims’ 
families,” said Pentti Partanen, the di­
rector of rescue services at the Finnish 
Interior Ministry.
The 515-foot Estonia was on a voyage 
from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, 
Sweden, at the time of the disaster.
Due to the extreme exposure and cold 
water identifying the victims has been 
difficult.
House approves 
Fair Trade bill
WASHINGTON, September 30 (DJ)
— The House Friday approved a wa- 
tered-down version of the Fair Trade in 
Financial Services bill, but the measure’s 
future is much less certain in the Sen­
ate. The House bill would give U.S. offi­
cials leverage to pry open closed foreign 
banking markets. But the bill, the Na- • 
tional Treatment Banking Act, does not 
cover the securities and insurance in­
dustries as its predecessor, the Fair. 
Trade bill, did. The National Treatment 
Banking Act would allow U.S. banking 
regulators to take action against foreign 
firms whose countries were found to be 
discriminating against U.S. banks. Be­
cause the bill deals only with banking, it 
avoids the jurisdictional disputes from 
the House Ways and Means Committee 
that sank the Fair Trade bill. It is not 
clear whether the Senate, with little 
time remaining this legislative session, 
will be able to take up the National 
Treatment bill. A Senate banking com­
mittee spokesman said no hearings have 
been scheduled on the bill. The bill is 
targeted mostly at countries in Asia and 
Latin America that didn’t agree to terms 
on financial services in talks on the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Train safety laws 
go to Congress
WASHINGTON, September 30 (DJ)
— The federal government will attempt 
within three years to enact tougher 
crash-protection regulations on train 
cars that carry passengers, Federal Rail­
road Administrator Jolene Molitoris 
said. She told Dow Jones that the first 
phase of the regulations would apply to 
high-speed trains, such as the 26 trains 
Amtrak plans to purchase for its north-, 
east corridor routes. The regulations' 
would be based largely on research that 
Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Ad­
ministration conducted to help set the 
bid specifications for those trains. 
Molitoris and Deputy Transportation 
Secretary Mortimer Downey, speaking 
after a U.S. Rail Summit here, said the 
regulations might produce rail cars that 
have stronger ends, “crush zones” to 
absorb impact from crashes, more pad-, 
ding on the backs of seats, and airline- 
style luggage racks to prevent loose bags 
from flying out of place. They said the 
rules probably would be modeled after 
car-safety rules, which specify the maxi­
mum impact on passengers in crashes of 
a certain speed, but would allow the 
manufacturer to decide how to achieve
that amount of protection. Also, the regu­
lations would apply to commuter-rail 
systems, some of which might not have 
the same safety expertise as Amtrak, 
Downey said. The Federal Railroad Ad­
ministration has also agreed to pay for a 
new test of “positive train control” tech- 
. nology, which would give computers 
greater control over train movements. 
Railroads are testing the technology as 
a way to avoid collisions.Troops return 
from Rwanda
KAMPALA, Uganda, September 30 
(DJ) — An American relief operation 
launched two months ago to ease the 
humanitarian disaster in Rwanda ended 
today with the withdrawal of the last 
American troops. U.S. Embassy officials 
in Kampala said the Americans turned 
over what was left of the operation to the 
United Nations and ended the mission 
without ceremony. “They came quickly 
and almost unannounced and they have 
left in the same way,” said Judith 
Gutterman, a spokeswoman for the em­
bassy.
At the height of the operation, 2,592 
American troops were in East Africa to 
help with an emergency airlift of relief 
supplies for 1.2 million Rwandan refu­
gees who fled into Zaire in July. The 
mission later was extended to include 
relief flights to the Rwandan capital, 
Kigali
American troops were also deployed 
at Entebbe, 22 miles southeast of 
Kampala, and in Goma, Zaire. 
Gutterman said she had no information 
on how many troops were in the last
• American contingent that left on the 
lone 'C-130 transport plane.
Businessmen 
sue record co.
LOS ANGELES, September 30 (DJ) 
—Lots of entrepreneurs worry that cozy 
relationships between big corporations 
. and their established distributors may 
be squeezing them out of valuable busi­
ness. Yesterday, Rick Smith and Shep 
Alster did more than fret.
The two businessmen filed suit in a 
Los Angeles state court accusing five of 
the nation’s biggest record companies of 
locking them out of a potentially lucra­
tive comer of the music trade: market­
ing the industry’s slow-selling merchan­
dise at a discount.
The suit charges units of Sony Corp., 
Thorn, EMI, PLC, Bertelsmann AG, 
Philips Electronics NV and Matsushita 
. Electric Industrial Co., and two major 
buyers of the discounted merchandise
with antitrust violations, racketeerii 
and defamation. The defendants either*
declined to comment or deniedany
wrongdoing. The discounted products 
are known as “cutouts”—compact dis^ 
and tapes that a record company decides 
aren’t selling well enough to peddle 
through its normal distribution chan, 
nels.
These items are “cut out” of the 
company’s catalogue of products and sold 
at a severely reduced price to a buyer 
that specializes in such merchandise, 
According to the entrepreneurs’ suitj 
the record companies have granted the 
cutout buyers “de facto and/or secret 
exclusive sales rights” in return for 
“bribes and kickbacks.”
The suit, filed by the entrepreneurs' 
wholesale distribution firm, Smith Alste;
& Co., seeks over $75 million in dam. 
ages.
It doesn’t provide additional details on 
the alleged payments.
Gifts denied to 
politicians
WASHINGTON, September 30 (
— The House, in a bid to damp public 
discontent with Congress, approved leg, 
islation banning gifts from lobbyists and 
recreational junkets financed by special 
interests.
By a 306-112 vote, Democratic lead­
ers overcame fierce opposition from Re- 
publicans and some of their own rank 
and file to approve the lobby-reform 
measure. The legislation still must be 
approved by the Senate before reaching 
President Clinton’s desk, but it is ex­
pected to pass there as well in view of it* 
wide public appeal. In a separate elec, 
tion-eve attempt at political reform 
House and Senate Democrats announce! 
a long-elusive agreement to revamp cam 
paign-finance laws by limiting candi 
dates’ spending and contributions from 
political action committees.
The outlook for final passage of cam 
paign reform remains dim, however 
since Democrats must overcome a Sen 
ate Republican filibuster and delaying 
tactics in the dwindling days of the ses 
sion. The measure would sharply ex 
pand the number of people required t<

Computing vice president resigns
By HEATHER ZINDLE
stintF OPF.Vi 0nt"" Li.nSi
On Thursday, September 22 William 
Anns, Vice President of Computing Ser­
vices met with President Robert 
Mehrabian and announced his resigna­
tion effective at the end of this calendar 
year.
Computing Services, 
according to Arms, “is ~ 
responsible for every­
thing on campus that 
does not get taken care 
of by someone else.”
It oversees central 
computing, clusters, the 
network, electronic mail, 
the Andrew system, 
print services, user sup­
port, the help center, the
computer store, com- _____________
puter repair, and the 
telephone system.
William Arms came to Carnegie 
Mellon in 1985, in a time of great change 
for computing. In the past, Carnegie 
Mellon had six large time share comput­
ers. The workstation was essentially a 
monitor and a keyboard, all work was 
conducted on one of these main comput­
ers. There was a move in the computing 
world to replace these terminals with 
personal computers.
The Andrew project was one of the
first to do so. That was just underway 
when Arms came to Carnegie Mellon.
The Athena project at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and the Andrew 
project at Carnegie Mellon were the first 
two systems that, according to Arms 
“worked out how to use large numbers of 
personal computers. The problems arise 
deal with developing a system that en-
“...After almost ten years at 
Carnegie Mellon, he sees an oppor­
tunity to do something different.”
- Dr. Paul Christiano 
Provost
ables all the computers on the network 
to work together as a team.”
Arms oversaw the Mercury project, 
which was implemented in 1991. This 
project developed the Library Informa­
tion System. It allows students to access 
information from their personal com­
puters on the network.
Carnegie Mellon also became the first 
university to have a high speed network, 
all under the direction of Arms.
Dr. Paul Christiano, the Provost said 
that Arms “did a wonderful job, imple­
menting the campus network, and main­
taining computer services.
He said “we are all very sorry to see 
him leave, but I understand why, be­
cause after almost ten years at Carnegie 
Mellon, he sees an opportunity to do 
something different.”
Arms has accepted a posi- 
tion with the Corporation 
for National Research Ini­
tiatives in Washington to 
work on projects having to 
do with digital libraries.
He feels proud of the 
changes in the world of com­
puting and the part that 
Carnegie Mellon has played, 
but feels that after almost 
ten years it is simply time to 
move on. However, he be- 
¦HMHn lieves Computing Services 
today is a “strong organiza­
tion,” and he wishes everyone well in the 
future.
The search for a replacement has not 
yet begun, but Christiano will begin to 
form a search committee, which he is 
thinking of heading himself. Arms came 
to Carnegie Mellon in a time of great

Pitt pulls article on 
same-sex marriage
By DECLAN McCULLAGH
stintF 0SF.Vi 0nt""pi.nSi
When Ken Hall and his partner 
shared marriage vows and exchanged 
gold rings in the University of 
Pittsburgh’s Heinz Memorial Chapel 
last month, they had no idea that their 
simple ceremony would cause the 
school to yank an article describing 
that ceremony from a campus news­
paper and enrage members of the 
University’s Board of Trustees.
Most marriages don’t raise eyebrows, 
but Hall’s partner was a man.
An article reporting the first same- 
sex marriage to be held at the school 
was scheduled to be published in the 
September 15 issue of the University 
Times, a newspaper published bi­
weekly by the department of univer­
sity relations.
Leon Haley, the publisher and vice- 
chancellor for student and public af­
fairs, pulled the article from the pa­
per. Haley says he removed the article 
from the paper because “we have a 
policy on private events at Heinz 
Chapel [such as] memorial services” 
that prohibits the paper from covering
them.
Some members of the Pitt commu­
nity say the marriage should have 
been covered and Haley’s decision was 
censorship.
“I think that Haley pulled it because 
he was afraid of the controversy and 
wanted to appease trustees who were 
upset. The University wants to keep 
the issue quiet,” says Sascha Layos, a 
Pitt staff member. Layos is a former 
president of Pitt BiGALA and a mem­
ber of the Lesbian Avengers, a queer- 
rights activist group.
The editor of the University Times, 
Nancy Brown, says, “I was ordered not 
to report a story that I prepared. It’s 
the first time in 15 years that this has 
happened.”
The University of Pittsburgh allows 
people affiliated with the school to use 
Heinz Chapel for religious ceremonies 
if an ordained religious official pre­
sides. Since Hall is a Pitt alumnus and 
the school has a policy prohibiting 
discrimination because of sexual ori­
entation, he was allowed to use the 
chapel for a marriage ceremony. The 
State of Pennsylvania, however, does 
not recognize same-sex marriages.
H&SS student dies
TRAGEDY, from page 1
student shocks a lot of people. “I 
think the death of someone so 
young can be tough for someone 
who is the same age.”, said Anne 
Shields, Associate Dean of Stu- 
1 dent Affairs “It wouldn’t surprise 
me at all if students need or de­
sired to talk it through.” Dean 
Murphy has said that counselors 
will be available at the Health 
Center 24 hours a day until Sun­
day.
Murphy was very upset with 
Gordon’s death. “When anyone 
dies it is sad, when a young per­
son dies it is especially sad,” he 
said, “It is not something you 
anticipate.”
No formal memorial service has 
been scheduled although Murphy 
said there will be an on-campus 
service next week in accordance 
'with the familys wishes.
Gordon leaves behind a mother, 
a father a younger brother and 
many people who were shocked 
and dismayed by the sudden loss 
of someone who was not on cam­
pus long.
“When a 17 year old dies this 
I quickly from an infectious dis­
ease its been difficult,” com­
mented Barkin.

9/28 SUSPICIOUS PERSON,
2:33 am. A Guard radioed that he 
*was watching a suspicious per­
son who had been inside the 
MargaretMorrisonPlaza 
Laundromat. The person was a 
white male in his twenties. After 
he stood around in the doorway of 
k the Laundromat, he began to walk 
on to the IM field towards the 
Tech Garage. The male was then 
stopped by officers in the stands 
°f Gesling Stadium. The male 
verbally identified himself and 
1 claimed he carried no identifica­
tion and that he was homeless. 
As the male was opening his coat, 
an officer saw that he had two 
black lace brassieres stuffed un­
der his arm. The males claimed 
.that his girlfriend had given him 
the brassieres but he did not know 
her phone number.
The male was taken to the Cam- 
Pus Police station but was first
Meningococcemia: 
the infection
Friday afternoon, Freshman 
H&SS student, Joseph Morgan 
died of meningococcemia at 
Montefiore Hospital.
The meningococcemia is a bac­
terium that collects in the nose 
and throat of many people during 
the late winter and early spring. 
In some people the bacteria can 
invade the bloodstream and pro­
duce sever, systemic illness char­
acterized by high fever and spon­
taneous bleeding below the skin, 
which resembles purple dots.
“It’s a very serious infection,” 
said Anita Barkin, Director of 
Health Services. The infection is 
transferred through direct con­
tact with respiratory secretion 
(saliva).
Kissing or drinking from the 
same glass will transmit the bac­
teria. “It’s a hard disease to con­
tract because of the method of 
transmission,” said Jamie Ma­
son, a Junior IM student and 
Operating Manager of EMS.
The Health Center has begun 
to give oral medication, to people 
who they feel are in danger of 
getting the disease. “We have 
screened over200 and have [given 
oral medication to] over 100,” said 
Barkin. As of press time, these 
numbers have increased to 400 
and 200 respectively.
The oral medication is taken 
twice a day for two days.
It is recommended to use an 
alternate form of birth control 
and not to wear contact lenses 
while on the medication.
Students who fear they may 
have contracted the infection are 
urged to report to Health Ser­
vices as soon as possible for a 
physical.

burgh. Popular belief has it that 
Hombostal built Carnegie Tech 
in the shape of a ship, but there 
is no historical or even geo­
graphical evidence to prove that 
to be the case. Still, the prow 
remains a popular attraction. It 
will, therefore, be relocated to 
the roof of Roberts Hall and look 
out onto Oakland. This will make 
the prow more visible from the 
exterior. The Pittsburgh History 
and Landmark Foundation ob­
jected to Roberts location be­
cause it will block part of 
Hammerschlag which is one of 
the most important landmarks 
in the city of Pittsburgh. But 
Roberts will not take away any 
of the exterior view of 
Hammerschlag because it will 
be started alongside the cliff. 
The famous tower where all of
Tech’s power used to be gener­
ated will still be completely vis­
ible. The project was just ap­
proved by City Planning on the 
27th of September and now even 
further plans for construction can 
be made. Tellers’ office works out 
requirements, budgets, and 
serves as consultants on all uni­
versity projects. Although the 
building was not designed by lo­
cal architects, local engineers and 
contractors will be employed for 
the construction stage. Construc­
tion of Roberts will not effect stu­
dent life the way the demolition 
of Skibo has.
Minor adjustments will be 
made but because construction is 
going on away from most activ­
ity, occupants of Scaife, 
Hammerschlag and Wean will 
bear the grunt of the construc­
tion noise and chaos.

Bookstore prices high compared to others
BOOKS, from page 1
burgh area (besides CMU) sells 
this book for $61.35. That leaves 
a $13.20 difference.
A representative at Wadsworth 
Inc, the publisher of the Calculus 
book, said that Carnegie Mellon’s 
suggested list price is $70.95. 
However, they receive a 33.3per- 
cent discount. That means stu­
dents pay $3.60 more than the 
list price, which is more than the 
25 percent markup.
In doing the math, you’ll find 
that in subtracting the discount 
from the list price, CMU pays 
$47.32 per book.
A 25 percent markup on $47.32 
is $63.10. That leaves Carnegie 
Mellon making a profit of $11.45 
per book.
According to information given 
by Stacer, CMU purchased 
around 639 of these textbooks. 
That works out to a profit of 
$7,316.55.
Figure this is inflated due to 
used textbooks and students buy­
ing from friends. This $7,000 is 
over and above the 25 percent 
markup profit.
When figured out, the book­
store makes $17,399.97 just on 
one run of a Calculus textbook. 
(This figure comes from price paid 
by student, $74.55, minus price 
paid by the Textbook store, 
$47.32, multiplied by number of 
textbooks purchased, 639.)
The closest comparison book­
store in the area, who asked to 
remain anonymous, pays $46.00

patted down. On his person there 
was a folding knife, and a page 
from a women’s underwear cata­
log. The male was identified by a 
phone by a friend. Campus Police 
checked and found that the male 
was not wanted and did not have 
any priors.
9/29 THEFT OF SERVICES,
8:18 am. An employee of the CMU 
Laundry Department reported a 
theft of services. An employee 
was not sure how access was be­
ing gained. There is a barrel key 
access panel on the side and the 
top panel is secured by a spring 
system. The advantage of this 
access is that the timer can be 
turned by hand, which eliminates 
the need for tokens. These inci­
dents have been happening in 
almost all the dorm areas. Three 
notes were found with broken 
access boxes. Two said “Merry
Christmas—The Laundry Aveng­
ers.” The third said, “Courtesy of 
the Laundry Avengers.”
9/29 VIOLATION OF UNI­
VERSITY RULES, 10:58 PM. 
Campus Police received a report 
of two people shooting a BB gun 
on the second floor of Scobell Hall. 
Officers responded tot he scene 
and found that a newspaper had 
been set up as a target. The paper 
was full of BB holes. The area 
was checked but no one fitting 
the description given by the caller 
was found.

They sell the textbook to the 
students at a price of $61.35. They 
are making $15.35 on each text­
book.
This is $11.88 less than CMU 
makes. The interesting thing, 
however, is that the comparison

jStudents need better 
access to computing
j President Mehrabian once ad- 
! dressed the Freshman class an­
nouncing that there were more 
| computers at CMU than there 
| were students. So why are CMU 
| students having problems find- 
} ing computers? The problem lies 
| mainly with access and avail­
ability to computer clusters 
I around campus. Several of them 
j arenotforstudentuseandmany 
, of them are used for classes, 
j Cluster hours are a problem.
; Margaret Morrison clusteris the 
j only “primary” cluster on cam- 
! pus that stays open 24 hours a 
rday, seven days a week. And 
j even it doesn’t seem to be open 
j Sunday mornings. Morewood 
i Gardens keeps the same hours 
I when classes are in session but 
Sits cluster only has eight Mac 
j computers. The Hunt cluster is 
¡larger, and more accessible;
| therefore, they should keep bet- 
| ter hours. Clusters like Cyert 
lHall also keep unreasonable 
hours. Cyert is closed on week­
ends, with Sunday being one of 
the most productive work days 
for CMU students.
Reservations are also a prob­
lem. Some students that meet 
in the clusters for class spend 25 
I minutes listening to a lecture 
instead of working on comput­
ers. We understand that some 
classes need to be taught on 
computers, but professors 
should be more courteous and 
1 courteous in reserving time in a 
j cluster.
j With as much money as we 
! pay to attend CMU, the univer- 
i sity should be providing more
options. Each academic build­
ing should have clusters avail­
able to all students. Because of 
CSW classes, you can forget 
about Baker 140 until second 
semester. If you’ve ever tried to 
get into a Baker Hall cluster, 
you’ll notice that most CSW 
classes only taking up half a 
cluster — but you can’t use the 
available computers.
All dorms on campus should 
provide some computer assis­
tance. Morewood Gardens is the 
largest dorm on campus, and 
there are not enough computers 
in its cluster to accommodate 
even one floor of residents.
Perhaps more training and 
hiring of C-Cons would also help 
the situation. Some, when they 
open a cluster, arrive up to 30 
minutes late. C-Cons should also 
be more aware of what’s occur­
ring in their cluster. If students 
are standing around waiting for 
a computer while others are 
playing games, C-Cons should 
be more helpful in removing 
those students from computers.
The one advantage we can find 
is the ability to reserve a com­
puter, but those reservation 
times should be posted on each 
computer so that you don’t sit 
down, begin a project only to 
have someone come over 10 min­
utes later with a reservation.
If CMU continues to spend our 
tuition dollars and our presi­
dent advertises our wonderful 
and abundant computer re­
sources, the university needs to 
look into this serious problem of 
accessibility.
Give more attention to 
recycling on campus
We are living in an environ­
mentally conscious society. 
People are concerned with the 
depletion of the ozone layer, 
deforestation and recycling. It’s 
in this last area where CMU 
lacks drive.
During the removal of Skibo, 
the university hired a construc­
tion company which recycled a 
maj ority of the materials—such 
as copper pipes, glass, and bath­
room fixtures. This was a posi­
tive effort to not waste usable 
materials. If the university could 
undertake that project, why 
can’t they start a campus-wide 
recycling program?
If CMU is going to promote 
itself as an environmentally con­
scious university, it should pro­
vide more recycling bins on cam­
pus, such as in dorms, eating 
areas, the Student Center and 
other campus buildings. 
Granted residence halls like 
Mudge and Donner posses recy­
cling bins, but do all the other 
dormitories have them as well? 
And those that do are not emp­
tied enough.
The recy cling containers in the 
dorms only include glass (some­
times) and cans, there is no place 
for plastic or newspaper, and 
often white paper is overlooked. 
Considering the number of 
newspapers distributed on this 
campus — and the number of 
plastic soda bottles sold by En­
tropy and Dining Services—we 
see this as a poor oversight on
Letters to the Editor

the part of the university.
As a contribution to the cam­
pus the Student Environmen­
tal Action Coalition (SEAC) 
sponsors a newspaper recycling 
drive once every semester. We 
commend SEAC for their efforts, 
but it’s not their responsibility 
to have these drives; it is the 
university’s.
The university is not com­
pletely incompetent when it 
comes to recycling, they do pro­
vide places to recycle white pa­
per near every copy machine 
and printer on campus. But 
what about placing them in 
dorms, in general public spaces, 
in mail rooms, or outside of class­
rooms? More recyclable white 
paper is thrown out than should 
be — the university should re­
solve this problem.
The university does provide 
places for cans and glass on cam­
pus, although there should be 
more. Some here are confusing. 
Signs on the wall read “Plastic 
Only” while on the canister it 
reads, “Cans Only.” To prevent 
confusion, the university could 
provide a color coding system. 
Each color could represent a 
classification ofrecyclables. For 
instance, blue is cans, red is 
plastics and so forth.
The recycling program should 
be simple with separate bins, 
and, above all, they should be 
emptied frequently. This solu­
tion would prevent wasting 
recyclables.

Last month, Stu­
dent Senate gave 
Alumni Relations 
$2,500 to pay for a 
Student-Alumni 
Homecoming Picnic that was designed 
to encourage interaction between stu­
dents and alumni. Unfortunately, the 
lunch that student activities fee money 
helped pay for on Saturday turned out to 
be neither a student-alumni event nor a 
picnic.
Because of a strong chance of rain in 
the morning, the Office of Special Events 
and Dining Services — who ran the 
picnic — decided to feed only alumni in 
the tent and send students to eat by 
themselves in Morewood Gardens and 
the Highlander cafeteria.
The administration offices involved in 
planning the Homecoming Picnic should 
have consulted students before making 
these contingency plans. They could have 
moved part of the picnic into the lobby of 
the College of Fine Arts building. Or 
they could have served both students 
and alums until the tent was full and 
then sent everyone else to Highlander 
and Morewood. At least that would have 
ensured that students could meet with 
alumni over lunch — which was the 
original purpose of the picnic, after all.
For many students, the Student- 
Alumni Homecoming Picnic turned out 
to be a waste of our activities fee money 
andawasteofour time. The administra­
tion must do a better job of planning 
events like this in the future.

Editor:
As the Student 
Alumni Relations 
Council (SARC) 
communications 
secretary,I feel com­
pelled to respond to last week’s editorial 
[“Special allocation fund not meant for 
picnics,” 9/26] and its indirect and direct 
criticism of SARC.
In your editorial, you maintain that 
the Homecoming Picnic “...exists mainly 
for the benefit of alumni in conjunction 
with their other Homecoming activities.” 
This is simply not true. Last year the 
picnic fed 1,252 students and 300 alumni. 
The alumni paid for themselves so the 
allotted activities fee money does not 
fund “...a large food service picnic on the 
Mall for alumni.”
coming Picnic does “.. .enrich student life 
on campus and provide memorable ex­
periences...” When I was a freshman 
(before I was even involved in SARC), I 
got my first “Class of 95” button at the 
Homecoming Picnic and last year I re­
member watching one of my friends eat 
a candied apple for the first time. These 
events are not earth-shattering, but they 
have enriched my life and created many 
pleasant memories. SARC is trying to 
build Homecoming and improve the qual­
ity of life in conjunction with the Alumni 
House, Residence Life, and Student Ac­
tivities. In addition to the Homecoming 
Picnic, we are sponsoring such events as 
the “Highlander Games” and the “Con­
cert Under the Stars” to provide stu­
dents with an opportunity to get in­
volved in Homecoming.
You are correct in realizing that not all 
of the 7000 students who contribute to 
the activities fee will participate in this 
year’s Homecoming Picnic. However, 
that is their choice. Do you think that 
funding five new student organizations 
with the $2500 is going to benefit all 
7000 students? What about the funds 
that go to Carnival or WRCT? Not every 
student would want their money to go to 
these causes. A picnic is one of the most 
universal things students can enjoy on 
campus.
I believe that you are misinterpreting 
the Senate by-laws when you argue that 
the activities fee should not be used to 
pay for food at this picnic. I think the 
particular by-law in question refers to a 
situation where an organization spends 
money allotted from the activities fee on 
food or travel that is exclusive to the 
organization. That is not the case with 
SARC; SARC is merely acting as an 
administrator for this money and it is 
the entire student body that will benefit.
In closing, I would like to suggest that 
in the future you attempt to verify your 
facts before issuing both editorials and 
articles. A simple check on the atten­
dance at past Homecoming Picnics might 
have given you a whole different per­
spective. You wrongly identified SARC 
as the Student Alumni Relations Com­
mittee instead of the Student Alumni 
Relations Council and you misspelled 
both Shelley Brozenick’s and Paula 
DiGioia’s names. In my opinion, these 
errors help diminish the credibility of 
both your editorial and your article.

Letter to 
the Editor
Unlike you, I believe that the Home- James Stepanek [“Guns protect inno­
cent, prevent crime,” 9/12] lacked rea- ! 
soning and common sense. But more 
importantly, it implied to all readers 
that guns are the only option of. self- 
defense.
Stepanek claimed it rational for a 90- 
pound girl to buy a gun in order to 4 
defend herself from a 250-pound male 
attacker.
But what about practical? In the event 
that this situation occurred, I doubt any 
female or male of a considerable weight 
disadvantage would be able to unzip 
their backpack/jacket, get their gun, re­
lease the safety on the gun, and aim it, 
while all the time trying to fight off the 
attacker.In fact, I’d put my money on the 280- 
pound male being able to successfully 
pry the gun away from the 90-pound 
victim before he/she even had a chance 
to use it. And what if the attacker also 
had a gun? Then it wouldn’t really mat­
ter how much he weighed if he was the 
one to pull the trigger first.
The scary part is, in today’s society, 
robberies or attacks could happen any­
where or anytime; on a date, jogging 
through Frick Park, or even at the su­
permarket. We cannot be expected to 
carry a gun 100 percent of the time, even 
though it may seem necessary.
It is for those times that I have no 
choice but to put my faith in the police. 
Unlike Stepanek, I believe that the po­
lice are there to protect us. Whether it is 
the police officers patrolling the “O” in 
Oakland on Saturday nights, or the CMU 4 
cops walking around Baker Hall at 9 
pm, they are indeed a contributing fac­
tor to our safety.
Firearms are certainly not the “only 
rational means of self-defense.” There 
are additional methods that must be i 
considered. As a female who has lived in 
an urban area all my life, I think there is 
a lot to be said for prevention — about 
playing it smart, using your head, and 
avoiding potentially dangerous situa­
tions altogether.
Stepanek was right about only one 
point in his column, and that is that 
“criminals have generally more to gain 
and much less to lose from ignoring 
laws.”
Seeing that Stepanek believes this, I fi 
cannot understand his apathy towards 
preventative measures. Owning a fire­
arm with intentions to shoot perpetra­
tors is not preventative. It is only a 
band-aid solution to the larger problem 
at hand.
Stepanek, you are sorely misdirecting 
your efforts by writing columns that 
only proclaim the value of owning a gun 
or the benefits of the NRA.
If you’re going to write articles for a 
college newspaper, you should consider 
your audience more carefully, and real­
ize that in order to prevent crime, you 
have to do a lot more than simply buy a 
gun.

Simplicity exists only in naive minds

BdB father-in-law sat with my daugh- 
,r on his lap. “Now who would want to 
bort this?”
Wouldn’t it be nice to live in such a 
¡rople world?
Roman Catholic priest Davit Trosch 
efends violence against those who per- 
irm abortions as justifiable in the fol- 
iwing manner: “If a person with a 
hotgun happened upon the scene of 
lassive butchering of innocent chil­
dren, and failed to act with deadly force, 
g quickly as possible, he would be 
3niraitting a grave offense against 
iod.”
Indeed.
It is hard to argue with this logic, for, 
be existence of God aside, the best 
eople have always taken the side of 
ie weakest against their oppressors, 
tis certainly true that a witness to the 
illing of innocents who does not act to 
top this killing is complicit in their
Responsibility figures prominently in free society
deaths.
Why is it, then, that most in the pro-life 
movement have attempted to distance 
themselves from those who kill abortion 
doctors? It cannot be said that being “pro­
life” is inherently non-violent, for there 
are few who are pacifists to the point 
of denying the right to self-defense. 
Given that the pro-life people claim to 
speak on behalf of those who are un­
able to defend themselves, let alone 
take part in non-violent protest, act­
ing on their behalf is more noble than 
acting on one’s own behalf.
Then why the unease with shooting 
doctors—taking the life of a “killer” to 
save the life of an innocent?
Perhaps most people have a hard 
time actually equating an abortion 
clinic with a Nazi concentration camp. 
Some would say that this is because 
the baby is out of sight and not as 
identifiable as the Jews and Gypsies. The 
pro-life people, like my father-in-law, would 
like us all to believe that, from the moment 
of conception onward, a smaller and ethi­
cally equal version of my healthy daughter 
exists within the woman’s womb.
It is understandable that they choose to 
believe this, for it simplifies their outlook to
a world of black and white not requiring 
any thought or debate. Yet when this view 
is taken to its inevitable conclusion — 
that, as with slavery and the Nazi Holo­
caust, a war is required to end the slaugh-
Chrls Ravin/Tartan Artist
ter of “innocents” — the squeamishness of 
most “pro-lifers” reveals the weakness in 
their simplified view of morality and re­
production.
Take the case of RU-486. This is consid­
ered to be abortion, “another way of killing 
babies.” Killing babies? This drug pre­
vents the blastocyst — an undifferenti­
ated, microscopic, hollow sphere of cells — 
from implanting in the woman’s uterus. Is 
the doctor who prescribes this medicine the 
moral equivalent of Josef Mengela? Is a 
woman who is raped and takes RU-486 a 
murderer? Surely not. The “death” 
of a fertilized egg is by no stretch of 
the imagination equivalent to shoot­
ing a doctor point-blank in the face.
The “pro-life” movement is, in gen­
eral, populated with passionate but 
naïve people who blindly believe the 
simplistic doctrines they have been 
taught. From the term “pro-life,” it 
seems they would spend at least as 
much time protesting (and even fight­
ing) for the lives of the innocent 
children dying in Rwanda, Bosnia, 
etc.
If they were truly moral, they 
would not pay someone to breed and 
butcher a fellow sentient being 
merely for a fleeting taste of flesh.
If they were truly pro-life, they would 
work to enlighten the world of grey, instead 
of shooting blindly into its black.

Whatever happened to respon­
sibility? Wasn’t that what we 
ounded this country on? I know 
ou’re going to say “No, it was 
nmded on the spirit of individual 
•eedom.” Yes, but this was based 
on a true understanding of free- 
lorn, not what passes for it these 
days. Freedom is not simply do­
ling what you want. That’s anar- 
iy. Freedom is being respon­
se for what you do.
This means that you can do 
things, but you have to be respon- 
ible for the consequences of your 
ictions. That is the principle by 
hich the US system of govern­
ment is meant to function. This is 
why we have the concept of “inno- 
ent until proven guilty,” and 
frown upon prior restraint. This 
ystem assumes that sane adults 
ire responsible for themselves
and are capable of handling their 
own affairs without encroaching 
on the rights of others.
Since I’ve mentioned them, I’d 
better define rights. Rights are 
merely opportunities to exercise 
one’s freedoms. In other words, 
they offer an opportunity to be 
responsible for yourself.
This does not include acts 
which impinge upon others’ op­
portunities. One does not have a 
right to medical care, but one 
does have a right to go get it for 
oneself. To have a right to medi­
cal care, you have to inform a 
doctor that he is an indentured 
servant at a rate you determine, 
or confiscate someone’s property 
to pay for the service. One has a 
right to property, but one does 
not have a right to others’ prop­
erty.
Our world these days has 
clouded these simple matters to 
the extent that people now have a 
“right” to welfare, a “right” to 
medical care, a “right” not to be 
offended, and even a “right” to a 
good job. Rights have become
some kind of claim by which 
people grab all manner of goodies 
for themselves.
Once we had a right to life, a 
right to free speech, a right to be 
free from unreasonable seizures 
without compensation (which in­
cluded in spirit a right to prop­
erty, but sadly the fact that the
ment grants no rights. The Bill of 
Rights recognizes rights which 
are assumed to be inviolate, and 
proscribes the government from 
infringing these rights. These 
rights are yours, given the pres­
ence of the government or not. 
These are the natural rights of 
which John Locke spoke. Reli-
Freedom is not simply doing what you 
want That's anarchy.
Constitution didn’t properly enu­
merate this right has certainly 
cost us), a right to own weapons 
for self defense, a right to free­
dom of religion, and a right to 
local government not intruded 
upon by the Federal government. 
This is just some of what’s listed 
in the Bill of Rights.
Of course people nowadays ac­
tually have the gall to claim that 
rights are granted by the govern­
ment. They say the Bill of Rights 
gives you these rights. This is 
absolutely wrong. The govem-
gious people will claim these are 
God-given rights. Being an athe­
ist myself, I say that they are 
rights inherent in human beings.
Instead of these principled in­
terpretations of government, we 
have what Bill Clinton advocates: 
“What can the government do for 
me?” This is not the credo of an 
American, this is the credo of 
cattle. They wait for the farmer 
to feed them, to water them, and 
to take care of them. They’re com­
fortable. Do you just want to be 
comfortable? Or did you come to
Carnegie Mellon to be better than 
that? I assume you want to strive 
and succeed, to be challenged and 
overcome, or you wouldn’t be 
wasting so much of someone’s 
money and bearing so much grief 
from the workload.
If people understood that free­
dom is responsibility, not just 
doing what they like, we’d be bet­
ter off. We wouldn’t have welfare 
mothers producing huge broods 
of children. We wouldn’t have 
children abandoned by their fa­
thers and left to grow up without 
any sense of responsibility. We 
wouldn’t have people defending 
criminals by saying their past 
excuses them. We wouldn’t have 
a dependent class expecting hand­
outs as a way of life. We wouldn’t 
have Clinton and company in 
charge of the highest office in the 
country trying to expand the 
fiefdom of the government.

Two Sundays ago, I didn’t get home
until well past midnight. As I traveled 
about my room doing all those things you do 
when you’ve been away all day, I ended up 
at the waste basket.
While my standing in front of a waste 
basket at two in the morning in a dark room 
may seem insignificant, I would like to 
point out that the wastebasket was right in 
front of the window.
Outside of the window was something 
incredibly bright. As you may expect, it was 
the moon. Only, I don’t remember the moon 
ever looking quite like that. It was magnifi­
cently large and bright. The sky was clear 
and even a few stars could be seen to comple­
ment our planet’s favorite natural satellite.
I was so taken aback by the sight that I
just stood there and stared for about five 
or ten minutes. I was afraid that the moon 
may never look like that again, so I whipped 
out a video camera and got some footage.
The next night, out of curiosity, I checked 
on the moon again. It was still there, of 
course. What was even more amazing to 
me was that it looked the same. There was 
still an awesome presence to this thing. 
So, the next day, I anxiously sought out 
the moon for the third time to discover 
that it still looked incredible.
Then I began to wonder: does the moon 
always look like that? Was it just that I 
had never noticed before? What a depress­
ing thought this would be.
Have I really been so busy all semester
that I haven’t even had a chance to look at 
the moon?
How terrible.
I just wanted to make sure that this 
doesn’t happen to anyone else. I know that 
we all have papers to write, books to read, 
problem sets to do, and thermonuclear dy­
namics to contemplate, but really, folks, if 
it gets to the point where we’re all too busy 
to take an occasional glance at the moon, I 
start to wonder: what’s the point?
Do your homework, have your parties, 
take a job ... fine. Just every now and then, 
give yourself a few minutes to go outside 
and look at the moon. Otherwise, how will 
we know it’s still there?

Homecoming proves disastrous for Tartans
gy JOHN WEBER
stintF 0nt""pi.nSi
Saturday was Homecoming for 
.he Tartans, who hosted the 
Jnited States Merchant Marine 
Academy. It was the first meet- 
ng between the two teams. The 
Mariners surprised the Tartans 
ind were able to pull off a 30-22 
1psetinfrontof2,731 onlookers. 
As they have done a lot this 
ieason, the Tartans allowed their 
ipponent to score first. After a 
,00d punt return by Brian 
Simpson, the Mariners found 
¡hemselves in great field position 
on their first offensive posses- 
¡ion. With just over 11 minutes 
eft in the first quarter, Mariners 
juarterback Brian Clark hit 
Kevin Feighery on an 18-yard 
,ass to give the Mariners the 
¡arly 7-0 lead.
The next bit of bad news for the 
Tartans came only about seven 
minutes later when senior quar­
terback Chris Dee was pulled 
from the game. He had been hav­
ing lower back pain all week, and 
after three possessions decided 
;hat he could not continue. Jun­
ior David Soltysik took over for 
;he Tartans at quarterback and 
mmediately had troubles. On his 
;hird play after entering the 
game, he was sacked for a six- 
•yard loss and in the process 
fumbled the ball away to the 
Mariners. The Mariners ended 
ip getting a 29-yard field goal out 
of the drive from kicker Mike 
O’Connell to extend their lead to 
LO—0 over the Tartans. This time 
^though, the Tartans answered the 
Mariner’s scoring drive quickly, 
<vith one of their own.
Sophomore Buck Neel returned 
¡he kickoff 33 yards to the 
Carnegie Mellon 44 yard line 
where the Tartans went right to 
¡work. Soltysik found senior Jim 
; Filicko downfield for a 21-yard 
jain and then sophomore Mike
Mathias scampered 35 yards for 
the Tartans’ first score. This cut 
the lead to 10-7 in favor of the 
Mariners.
But the Mariners came right 
back. Running back Corey 
Marker led the attack with a
emy a six-point lead, 20-14.
The second half started off as 
slow as the first half had. With 
just over nine minutes left in the 
third quarter the Tartans punted 
to the Mariners’ Simpson, who 
returned the kick 55 yards all the

couple of nice rushes, and Clark 
completed two big gainers to keep 
the drive alive. With about nine 
minutes left in the first half Clark 
found Feighery for an 18-yard 
touchdown pass to give the Mari­
ners a 10-point lead, 17-7. 
Carnegie Mellon’s next drive was 
then stopped by the Mariners’ 
leading tackier, Ty Bachmann, 
who intercepted a Soltysik pass 
with only 4:41 left in the first 
half.
But the Tartans weren’t done 
yet. On a second and 10 play 
Clark went back to pass and threw 
it right into the hands of senior 
lineman Merle Atkinson who 
promptly returned it 42 yards for 
the Tartan score. This made the 
score 17-14 in favor of the Mari­
ners. But the Mariners’ next drive 
covered 67 yards in seven plays 
to set up another field goal. 
O’Connell’s 24 yard field goal with 
only 40 seconds left in the half 
gave the Merchant Marine Acad­
way down to the Tartans’ seven 
yard line. After the Tartan de­
fense held, O’Connell kicked his 
third field goal of the afternoon, 
this one from 24 yards away, to 
give the Mariners a 23-14 lead. 
On the next possession, the Tar­
tans drove all the way down to 
the Mariners’ 12-yard line, but 
were stopped by the Mariners 
defense on fourth and one yard to 
go. It was all downhill from there.
The next score wasn’t until the 
fourth quarter and it was by the 
Mariners. On third and nine to 
go, Clark threw a 42-yard bomb 
to receiver Scott Volkert, which 
put the ball on the Tartans’ 19 
yard line. Then Marker ran the 
ball all the way down to the four 
yard line on the next play. And 
sure enough, a few plays later, 
Marker ran it in from the one 
yard line to give the Mariners a 
very large 30-14 lead. The Tar­
tans weren’t done yet, though. 
Soltysik led the Tartans down
the field with short quick passes, 
and with just over four minutes 
left in the game, he found Filicko 
in the end zone for a nine-yard 
touchdown pass. Soltysik then 
hit his tight end a few seconds 
later to give the Tartans two more 
points on the scoreboard. This 
cut the Mariners’ lead to 30-22, 
but it wasn’t enough. The Mari­
ners were able to run out the 
clock and win the game 30-22.
After the game defensive coor­
dinator Terry Bodnar said that 
he “was very impressed with the 
Merchant Marines.” He felt that 
the Mariners had very good wide 
receivers and one of the best quar­
terbacks that the Tartans have 
had to face this season. He also 
said that “Marker was a very 
good back” and that because 
Marker was able to run as well as 
he did, the Tartans were unable 
to get much of a rush on Clark, 
which helped the Mariners’ pass­
ing game. Bodnar also said, how­
ever, that he didn’t “think they 
punched us off the ball,” and he 
also felt that injuries definitely 
hurt the Tartans’ cause. Even 
Atkinson, who made the long 42- 
yard interception return, was 
playing injured. Bodnar also told 
me that he has not been satisfied 
with the play of the special teams 
these last two weeks. “Last week 
we were not pleased with the 
kickoffs, this week it was kickoffs 
and punts.” He promised that the 
Tartans would use this upcom­
ing bye week to work on their 
special teams play.
Finally, Bodnar said what he 
thought of his two comerbacks, 
sophomore Nathan Morgan and 
junior Robert Locke, who have 
been so effective this season. He 
told me that “overall the second­
ary has played very well this 
year,” and that Morgan and Locke 
were the best two comers he had 
ever coached. He also said not to 
forget sophomore Albie Fletcher
who backs up Morgan and Locke 
at comerback.
The Mariners finished the game 
with 177 yards rushing while the 
Tartans were only able to get 80 
yards on the ground. The Mari­
ners held the ball for almost 34 
minutes and finished the game 
with 309 total yards. Marker was 
the Mariners’ leading rusher with 
133 yards on 33 carries and one 
touchdown. Clark was 8 for 17 on 
the afternoon with one intercep­
tion and two touchdown passes. 
O’Connell finished the game with 
three field goals and Simpson fin­
ished the game with four punt 
returns for 107 yards.
The Tartans’ leading rusher 
was Mathias with 65 yards and a 
touchdown; Grusky was second 
with 32 yards. Dee only attempted 
four passes and completed one 
before he left the game in the first
quarter. Soltysik finished the 
game with 11 completions on 20 
attempts for 137 yards and a 
touchdown. He was also sacked 
three times by the Mariners. 
Filicko was the top receiver with 
55 yards on three catches, while 
Mathias had 46 yards on three 
catches. Finally, sophomore 
punter Frank Triggiani finished 
the game with seven punts for a 
total of 255 yards, an average of 
36.4 yards a punt.
Next Saturday the Tartans 
have a bye week. The Tartans 
will play their first UAA game 
against Washington University 
in St. Louis on Saturday, October 
15. Kickoff will be at 1:30pm cen­
tral time. Saturday, October 22, 
is the Tartans’ next home game. 
Kickoff for that game against the 
University of Chicago will be 
1:30pm.

Ex-IM Director enjoys retirement
By JASON TOGYER
utintF 0nt""pi.nSi
Earl J. Birdy pauses. He’s sitting in 
the living room of his West Mifflin home, 
and talking, about his years as a NCAA 
¿Division I football referee.
“I don’t think I ever had a job that I 
•eally didn’t enjoy,” Birdy says. “And I 
•eally enjoyed working at Carnegie 
;Mellon. I never had a day when I woke 
up and didn’t want to go to Carnegie 
[Mellon. I’d wake up and say, ‘Oh, I can’t 
ait to get to Carnegie Mellon.’ ”
Birdy, a 43-year veteran faculty mem­
ber at CMU, whose career at the Univer­
sity spanned four school 
presidents and included 
stints as a physical educa- 
¿on instructor, chairman of 
he Faculty Club, College 
Club, and Day Care com­
mittees, and 26 years as the 
intramural director, an­
nounced his retirement in 
¡July. Birdy says he’ll miss 
working with students, fac­
ulty, and staff.
“I really enjoyed it. In fact,
[ was there for so long that I 
got to know a lot of people on 
fcmpus,” he says. Birdy be- 
ame somewhat famous 
wound the Athletic Depart­
ment for having a sign on 
ns door that said “Please 
:°me in. I can help.”
‘Students were just amazed,” he re- 
Mls. “They’d come in, and I’d say, ‘What 
may I do to help?’ and they’d say, Wait 
i minute. You’re going to help me?’ And
* didn’t have the answer, I’d find one 
)ut- Even if they just needed to see the 
athletic director, I’d give them direc­
ts to his office. I really enjoyed it. It 
Was fun, it was a fun job.”
Birdy says he enjoyed interacting with 
s students. “I’d see you walking down 
' e Cut, and I’d say, ‘Hey, how’d your 
1 am do last night?’ or ‘How many points 
you score last night?’ The minor- 
eague [IM] basketball games used an 
°ur clock, and I’d come in the next 
Corning and they’d say the core was 8-
6, and I’d say ‘8-6?’ But they dyed shirts, 
and ran around, and they thought they 
were having a great time.”
“I’m not sorry that I spent my life at 
Carnegie Mellon,” he says. “Carnegie 
Mellon has been very good to me, and I 
always did my best for Carnegie Mellon. 
I don’t have any complaints.”
Birdy retired to spend more time with 
his wife, four grown children, and his 
five-year-old grandson, Jeffrey Klein. 
He left of his own accord, he emphasizes. 
“I’m on a two year leave of absence from 
the University,” he says, “and at the end 
of that two years, I will retire.”
Jason Togyer/Tartan staffwriter 
Eari Birdy stands by a photo of himself as an official.
Earned seven varsity letters
“I’m strictly Pittsburgh,” Birdy begins. 
“I spent the first 14 years of my life in 
Hazelwood. When I was 14 years old, we 
moved to the E ast End. I went to Peabody 
High School. I was very active in sports; 
I earned seven varsity letters: two in 
football, two in basketball, one in soccer, 
one in volleyball, and one in track. I was 
a miler in track.”
Birdy earned his letter for varsity vol­
leyball the year Peabody won the state 
championship. “We won the state cham­
pionship in 1944, we beat Homestead 
High up in Altoona.”
Then came World War II. “I joined the
United States Marine Corps in January 
1945,” he says. “My class graduated in 
June of ’45 and when my class gradu­
ated, I was overseas, sitting in the har­
bor in Guam. My mother received my 
high school diploma.” Birdy had already 
earned enough college preparatory cred­
its to graduate by the time he left Peabody 
in January, and received extra credits 
for enlisting in the armed forces. “All my 
friends were going into the Army and 
Navy, and I wanted to be different, so I 
went into the Marine Corps,” he says. “I 
was 145 pounds of Marine.” He smiles.
“When I was discharged from the 
Marine Corps, I came home and started 
to attend Slippery Rock [University],” 
Birdy says. “I started in January of1947, 
and at Slippery Rock I received a very 
serious knee injury, I had some cartilage 
removed, and that kind of ended my 
athletic career.”
He was playing varsity football when 
he hurt his knee. “Back in those days I 
was.a quarterback, and we wore these 
big, long cleats. I used to stick those big, 
long cleats in the ground and try to turn. 
In high school I received my initial in­
jury, and when I got to college it just got 
worse.”
Birdy says that it hurt to know he 
wouldn’t be able to play organized sports 
again. “To see all your buddies out there 
playing, and you’re sitting in the stands, 
oh mtFT that hurt,” he says.
’Burgh winter sparked CMU job
“I graduated from Slippery Rock in 
January of 1951, and teaching jobs were 
very difficult to find,” he says. “I was 
placed on the permanent substitute list 
with the city of Pittsburgh at Overbrook 
School on [State] Route 51 [Saw Mill 
Run Boulevard].
“I heard that there would be a vacancy 
at Carnegie [Tech]. So I put my applica­
tion in for the job, but they had just hired 
someone for that position,” he remem­
bers. “Well, that was the year we had the 
big snow, and the person they hired was 
from North Carolina, and at the end of 
that school year, he went back to North

Volleyball proves punchless at conference round-robin
By CARTER M. YANG
stintF OPF.Vi 0nt""pi.nSi
“It was a hellish weekend,” said 
women’s volleyball head coach Heather 
Hollands about the September 24-26 
University AthleticAssociationRound 
Robin Tournament at Emory Univer­
sity. Senior co-captain Molly Brennan 
insisted a week before the tournament 
that the Tartans just needed to find 
"that extra ‘oomph.’ " Judging from 
; the final scores, they didn’t find it at 
Emory.
At the UAA Round Robin, each of 
the conference’s eight teams plays ev­
ery other team once. The results de­
termine how the teams are seeded for 
the UAA Championships. The Tar­
tans went 0-7, winning only three of 
24 games played, and will be seeded 
eighth in the October 28-29 champi­
onships at Washington University in 
St. Louis.
On day one of the tournament, the 
Tartans lost 3-1 {13-15,11-15,15-8,
6-15)to Brandeis University, and 3-0 
(8-15,4—15,7-15) to the University of 
Rochester. On day two, they lost 3-0 
(6-15. 13-15, 7-15) to Case Western 
Reserve University, 3-1 (0-15,15-12,
4-15,4-15) to Emory University, and 
3-0 (0-15, 4-15,10-15) to Washing­
ton University in St. Louis. And on 
day three, the team lost 3-0 (2-15,7- 
15,4-15) to the University of Chicago, 
and 3-1 (15-13, 8-15,1-15, 5-15) to 
New York University.
The Tartans ran a 6-2 formation, 
with two setters and three hitters, 
always setting from the back court. 
Their fast and well-balanced offense, 
with emphasis on quick sets and cross­
ing patterns to disguise the hitter, 
was noticeably improved. They were 
also amuch tougher serving team than 
they had been at their previous tour­
nament at Marietta. “Our offense was 
there,” insisted Brennan, “We put the 
ball down against every team.”
Hollands admitted that the team’s 
performance at Emory was, in some 
ways, a disappointment. “We expected
to beat Brandeis and Case [Western 
Reserve], and to be more competitive 
against Emory,” she said, “I thought 
the matches would be a lot closer.” 
According to Hollands, the team was 
undone by som ething that has plagued 
them all season: inconsistency. “We 
allowed strings of points to occur,” she 
explained, “We’d start strong and then 
lapse or we’d let the other team get 
ahead early and then have to play 
‘catch-up.’ ”
But the Tartans are not discour­
aged. “Of course it would be nice to 
have a lot more wiiis on the board,” 
Hollands admits, “but [the players] 
learned who they are as a team and 
they’re not the team that loses 15-1. 
They know what it takes to win and 
they’re more determined than ever.”
Hollands cites her players’ lack of 
height and competitive playing prior 
to collegiate play as key weaknesses, 
but insists that the quality of her play­
ers both as athletes and as individuals 
is veiy high. “Their unity, determina­
tion, and strength of character make 
up for what they lack in size and expe­
rience.”
The Tartans showed that strength 
of character in their match against 
Washington. After losing the first two 
games 15-0 and 15-4, the Tartans 
battled back in the third game, taking 
and holding the lead for several points 
and scoring a total of 10 times against 
the. three-time defending champions. 
Although the game showed up as a 
defeat in the final standings, Hollands 
insists that it was a moral victory.
“In the beginning,” she explains, “the 
team didn’t believe they could com­
pete against the national champs.... It 
would have been really easy for them 
to roll over, but they fought back at 
every chance. I’m really proud of 
them.” The Tartans were the first of 
only three teams to score double digits 
against Washington.
“We felt like we were right in there,” 
said senior co-captain Carolyn 
Skarada, “We didn’t come out of there

10The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 3 October 1994
Women's soccer claims first in UAA
By ANU J GUPTA
stintF 0nt""pi.nSi
This past week, the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team continued it’s sea­
son in fine form as it took two games 
from tough opponents, Seton Hill Col­
lege and Emory University.
The Seton Hill matchup was Wednes­
day evening. The Tartan women were in 
control as they shut out the tough NAIA 
team by a score of 3-0. Goals were scored 
by sophomore Mae Hogan, who had two
on direct kicks, and one by freshman 
Kim Umeda.
Saturday was the real highlight of the 
week, though, as the Tartans capped off 
a successful homecoming weekend with 
a win against UAA rival Emory Univer­
sity, 1-0.
The game was an extremely well- 
fought contest throughout, but in over­
time, the Tartans managed to squeeze 
one by the tight Emory defense as fresh­
man Lauren deRosset scored on a cross­
ing pass from senior Christinia Isaly.
According to head coach Julie Shackford, 
“a lot of people thought Christina’s pass 
was going to go out of bounds, so Lauren 
deserves a lot of credit for getting to the 
ball.”
According to Shackford, though, the 
key to the game lay in the fact that “we 
took their key people out of the game 
early.” She described the game as largely 
“a defensive battle, and a lot of play in 
the midfield areas.”
The game was probably the most im­
portant of the season up to this point,
due to the fact that 
both teams were unde­
feated in the UAA, and 
the winner would thus 
be in the first place. It 
also improved the Tar­
tans’ overall record to 
6-2-1, and has given 
them hopes of again re­
taining a position in 
the Great Lakes re­
gional rankings — a 
position they had lost.

Men’s soccer overcomes tragedy, posts win

The men’s varsity soccer team had an 
extremely successful week, winning all 
three of its games, including two big 
match-ups against UAA rivals. How­
ever, they also suffered their greatest 
loss of the year. Teammate Joseph Gor­
don was hospitalized Thursday with 
meningococcemia. He died the following
day. Gordon was a well liked player, and 
his death left the team stunned. “He was 
such a nice kid,” said head coach Nick 
Gaudioso. “He was a bright kid... it’s a 
tough thing.”
“It was such a sudden thing,” said 
senior midfielder Pat Lucignani. “We’re 
just devastated by it.”
In memory of Gordon, the team wore 
black ribbons on the front of their jer­
seys when they defeated Emory Univer­
sity 2-0. After an intense, but scoreless, 
first half, CMU really started to pres­
sure Emory’s defense. Senior forward 
Michael Brazinski got the first goal for 
the Tartans with a shot to the lower left 
comer of the net from 30 yards out. 
CMU’s second goal came from senior 
forward Alex Amezquita off a corner 
kick by senior midfielder Vince Russell. 
Amezquita’s shot deflected off an Emory 
defender. Senior goalkeeper Dan War­
ren tallied the shutout.
“Everyone played 100 percent. I can 
honestly say that this is the first game 
where all 11 players played to the best of 
their ability,” said Lucignani.
Friday evening, the Tartans hosted 
the Violets of New York University, a 
tough UAA opponent. The Tartans came 
out of this UAA game with a 3-2 over­
time victory. The offensive star of the 
game was freshman midfielder Jason
Buelow, who had his first hat trick.
In the second half of overtime,. 
Brazinski sent a ball through to Buelow 
who squeezed it in.
“It was a great effort with the lineup 
that we had,” said Brazinski. “Both teams 
played very well. It just came down to 
who wanted it more.”
Tuesday night, hosted Waynesburg 
College. The Tartans wallopedi 
Waynesburg 6-0.
Veteran administrator reminisces about career
BIRDY, from page 9 
Carolina!
“Well, they had a vacancy, so I 
was interviewed during the sum­
mer of 1951 and I was hired as a 
instructor in physical education.”
At that time, says Birdy, all 
students except for drama ma­
jors were required to take two 
years of phys ed. “Also, each stu­
dent, before he or she graduated, 
had to swim 50 yards,” he says. 
“That’s two lengths of the pool. So 
I taught physical education and 
swimming.
“I loved it. I love teaching, and 
I love teaching swimming. I initi­
ated the swimming program over 
there that they use now... I taught 
the water safety course and the 
lifeguard course, not only at CMU, 
but at other pools.”
Became last faculty member 
in Athletic Department
“Back then,” says Birdy, “you 
worked three years as an instruc­
tor, and the University had the 
decision to let you go or move you 
up to assistant professor. You 
were given two three-year con­
tracts as an assistant professor. 
At the end of that time the Uni­
versity had the chance to let you 
go or make you an associate pro­
fessor.
“When I came up for associate 
professor, the academic teachers 
did not want the physical educa­
tion teachers to have the same 
titles, so I they created a new 
title, and I was made a ‘senior 
physical educator,”’ he remem­
bers wryly. “But I received all the 
benefits of a faculty member, and 
when I left Carnegie Mellon, I 
was the last person in the depart­
ment to have tenure and faculty 
status. The rest of the depart­
ment is staff.”
Birdy received his tenure in 
1961. “One year they forgot that 
I had been there three years, so I 
had another year as an instruc­
tor,” he says.
He continued to teach phys ed 
classes, including swimming, 
handball, racquetball, weight 
training, volleyball, water safety, 
and lifeguard training, and says 
he was disappointed when the 
requirement was cut back, and 
then eliminated altogether.
He particularly likes to train 
lifeguards. “I not only taught 
them safety, but I also taught
them about maintenance, filtra­
tion systems, and management 
— how to treat guards, making 
up schedules. I felt I had a good 
background in aquatics,” he says, 
noting that he is president and 
executive director of the Western 
Pennsylvania Country Club 
Swimming Pool Association. The 
involvement in the group (which 
includes 23 country clubs), he 
explains, stems from his 39 years 
as pool director for St. Clair Coun­
try Club, south of Pittsburgh.
“I’m not a job hopper,” he 
laughs.
Birdy also held the roles of di­
rector of athletics, head of physi­
cal education, and head of aquat­
ics at St. Edmund’s Academy in 
Squirrel Hill. “I used to go up 
there in the afternoon when my 
classes were completed at 
Carnegie Mellon,” he says. “I also 
coached soccer, baseball, basket­
ball, cross-country, and track. I 
was only there 24 years.”
Made name in intramurals
“In addition to my duties as 
swimming instructor, I took over 
the intramural program from 
1955 to 1957,” he says. Then, he 
left IM for 11 years. “In 1968 Mr. 
Boyer [the then-director of IM] 
went up to Slippery Rock and I 
took over the IM program again 
and stayed.”
“There weren’t too many 
changes between 1957 and 1968,” 
he recalls. “But when I took over 
in 1968,1 emphasized more par­
ticipation. I put a lot of time and 
effort into trying to get more 
people to participate in the pro­
gram. Over the last 10 years, I 
really put a lot of effort into get­
ting females involved in the pro­
gram.
“In 1968 we maybe had 25 or 30 
basketball teams. No women’s 
leagues at all. Today we have 101 
teams. In the last two years over 
70 percent of the male student 
body participated in at least one 
IM sport.”
Birdy thinks that a number of 
things enabled the IM program 
to explode during his tenure 
there. “We were treated very 
kindly by The Tartan,” he says, 
with the newspaper printing sta­
tistics, scores, and standings. 
“Everybody likes to see their 
name in print,” he chuckles.
“WRCT was very kind to the
IM program as well,” says Birdy. 
For a time, he was the host of “A 
Busload of Sports,” a weekly pro­
gram about IM on WRCT, spon­
sored by Homestead’s DeBolt- 
Somerset Bus Company. In addi­
tion, he says the station has been 
very cooperative in publicizing 
IM results and standings during 
sports broadcasts.

halls all night!”
“Every year I’d dress up in a 
different outfit. One year I was a 
lifeguard, another year I was a 
golfer, and people seemed to en­
joy that,” he says. “They’d put me 
on the schedule right after lunch 
time, when everybody was half 
asleep, and I’d come in and perk 
them up.”
The only thing that might limit

helped the program was his in­
volvement in freshman orienta­
tion. “My assistant and I would 
go in and talk to the freshmen,” 
he says. “I finally wormed my 
way in to talk to the freshmen 
about how easy it was to partici­
pate in the intramural program. 
I would talk at orientation, then 
I would talk to the RAs about the 
advantages of getting their stu­
dents to play IM.
“They could help me by getting 
students to participate in the IM 
program, and I could help them 
by getting students off of their 
floors, out of the dorms, out of the 
sororities and fraternities, and 
get them out and make them so 
tired that when they got back, 
they wouldn’t run around the
participation, says Birdy, is the 
size of CMU’s athletic facilities. 
“I think that the program’s satu­
rated. I don’t know if they’re go­
ing to handle more teams,” he 
says. “We have the same number 
of [basketball] courts now [five] 
as when we started. I’d have guys 
come to me and say they wanted 
practice time for their team, and 
I’d say, Tou want to p2tn“U Birdy 
hopes that the facilities being 
included in the new University 
Center will help to alleviate that 
problem.
“Another thing we did to in­
crease participation was to break 
the major sports up into four 
leagues,” he says. “We had the 
major leagues, which was good 
ball. Intermediate was fair. Mi­
nors was "PFW Some of the guys 
didn’t have too much athletic abil­
ity, but they had a lot of fun. And 
that’s what intramurals is all 
about is having fun. And last but 
not least, but probably most im­
portantly, is the women’s league.”
Worked with college foot­
ball greats
“For 25 years I officiated major 
college football,” says Birdy, who 
was inducted into the Western 
Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame 
for his work as a head linesman 
in the NCAA.
“They say that everyone has 
their 15 minutes of glory in their 
life,” Birdy begins. “I think my 15 
minutes of glory came in 1978. 
Pitt was playing West Virginia at 
Pitt Stadium, and Tony Dorsett 
was running the ball. He got tack­
led, and the kid from West Vir­
ginia piled on. Dorsett got up, 
and at first I had [a] 15 yard 
[penalty] on the kid from West 
Virginia.
“Dorsett got up, and hit the 
young man from West Virginia 
with the ball. Now I had 15 yards 
on Tony Dorsett. Well, the boy 
from West Virginia pushed 
Dorsett, and now I had 30 on 
West Virginia and 15 on Tony 
Dorsett.
“So Dorsett swings at the kid’s 
head, misses and hits him in the 
chest. Now I put another 15 on 
number 33 [Dorsett], tF« sVFB 
cVirSnn .r n2iVpF VPn V" n2S etmSW 
So Tony Dorsett’s senior year,
the last minute and 15 seconds ol, 
his final game at Pitt Stadium, 
he sat on the bench!
“Now when he punched the kid, 
the West Virginia team came rac­
ing across the field, and a big 
fight broke out. And I got knocked, 
on the seat of my pants. I lost my 
hat and my whistle. A very good 
friend of mine, Paul Bates, who 
works in the NFL now, came over 
and dragged me out of the fight 
by the back of my collar. So when 
they finally got everything 
straightened out and the f 
stopped, I went over to Johnny 
Majors. I said ‘Coach Majors, 
number 33 is gone for the day.’
“And Majors said, ‘Earl, I don't 
blame him.’ I said, ‘Coach, I’m 
not blaming anyone, but Dorsett 
is out,’ and so I probably became 
the only person ever to throw 
Tony Dorsett out of a football 
game!”
“I had an incident with Ed 
Marinaro, who [later] became a 
big TV star,” he says. “Now, 
Marinaro was playing up at 
Cornell, and they had the stu­
dent body left and right [on the 
field], so he ran his favorite play 
along the sidelines, looking fora 
hole, and got tackled. Now they 
had a little crest along the side of 
the field, so he sort of rolled down 
in the gutter and the tackier rolled 
on top of him. And he took the ball 
and just dunked it on the boy who 
tackled him.
“So later in the game, there 
was a pass thrown in the

Top-notch receivers don’t mean wins
Before the season started there were a

caught the ball, the defender tripped and fell 
backwards on the receiver,’- Birdy says.
“Well; 1 gave them the touchdown, but Ed 
Marinaro was upset that this kid fell on his 
teammate. So he came over and said to me 'Did 
you see that?’ and X said yes, I saw that, and he 
said ‘Aren’t you going to call it?’ and I said, ‘i t was 
accidental,’ and he said “What? You saw that and 
you aren’t going to call it?’
“I said, “No, and for anotherthing, you're in the

night before, so I would have ray bag packed, and 
drive right out to the airport and fly to wherever 
the game was.”
The only dark period during his career with the 
NCAA came duringa Harvard-Yale football game 
in 1972, when he was caught in the middle of a 
play .“I broke two bones in my left leg and dislo­
cated my elbow,” he recalls. “They said it was the 
worst injury in the history of Harvard football, 
and that I might never be able to run again. Two 
years later, I was working the Orange Bowl!" 
Birdy continued to teach while he convalesced.
Loved Tech’s glory days
Birdy particularly liked the days whenCamegie 
Tech was a local sports power-house. “I loved 
when we played big time basketball,” he says. 
“We had to collect the tickets at the home games, 
a«d they used to line up four abreast all the way 
out the door, down the steps, and up the street. 
1 lie crowds in that gym were unbelievable. They’d 
put risers up to the stage, people would be stand- 
mg all around the floor, and sitting up on the 
rafters. We played West Virginia, Penn State, 
Pitt, Duquesne —• that was big-time basketball!
“We were playing Pitt one night, and not only 
did we have to collect tickets, but we had to act as 
ushers and help with crowd control. Something 
happened up near the stage right underneath 
the basket, and a big fight broke out.
This big Pitt player came running down and 
«'anted to. participate in the fight and I got 
between this Pitt player and the people skir­
mishing and ordered him to return to the bench. 
Well; it turned out to be Mike Ditka. He was a big 
kid. He was a better football player than a bas­
ketball player, but he was their ‘hammer.’ If they 
wanted to clear people out of the way, they’d put 
in big Mike!
“I saw some great basketball players here. ‘Hot 
Rod’ Huntley, from West Virginia, was one. 
Carnegie Tech beat West Virginia at West Vir­
ginia, and that was a rare occasion! We backed 
the bus right up to the locker room doors. We 
didn’t dare walk out into the parking lot!
“They had some good football teams,” he says. 
“They used to play their home games at Forbes 
Field and the Kiltie Band would march down 
from the campus. They had about 120 peoplein 
that band, and they would march out onto the 
field in formation.
“It was fantastic. They were breathtaking. 
They’d open those iron gates out in centerfield, 
and they'd play the bagpipes while they marched 
in real slowly. Once the last member got inside, 
they'd close the gate, and they'd start playing 
real fast, and everyone would go nuts!”
Tech’s days camé to an end when the adminis­
tration discontinued athletic scholarships as part 
of a major change in philosophy, says Birdy. “I 
think it all had to do with scholarships. Years 
ago, they had athletic scholarships, and when 
they did away with scholarships we couldn’t 
compete,” he says. ‘They thought it would take 
too much away from their academic program.”
Retired to spend time with family
“My wife has been retired for two years now,” 
says Birdy. “She taught physical education at 
Steel Valley High School [in Munhall], While 
we’re physically fit, and still able to travel, we 
want to do that, and spend a little more time with 
[grandson] Jeffrey Gordon Klein!”
Birdy says that for most of his professional life, 
he’s been on the move. “I’d teach my classes at 
Carnegie Mellon, run up to St. Edmund’s, go 
home and eat dinner, and then go back to school 
to oversee the night program.”
Shirley Birdy says that her husband’s busy life 
took a toll on the family. “I always say that I 
raised the four children,” she says, amused.
“No, we had some interesting times, and the 
children got to have some interesting trips 
through football.”
“They all loved to go to Penn State,” Earl Birdy 
says. Td say, ‘Where do you want to go?’, and the 
answer would be ‘Penn State.’ ”
“We all enjoyed his officiating,” says Shirley 
Birdy . “Although we didn’t like his being away so 
tnueh. But there’s a price to pay for everything.” 
Birdy says he’s still as busy as ever. “Every day. 
seems like Saturday. People ask me, ‘How do you 
findretirement? Aren’t you boredyet?’, andlsay, 
'I’ve been so busy I haven’t really had time to ^et 
bored!’ I’ve got a ‘honeydew’ list — ‘Honey, do 
this,’ and ‘Honey, do that...’ “
“Don’t you believe that,” Shirley Birdy cor­
rects.

feeling like losers. ... We earned 
theirrespect and they know we’re

The Tartans don’t plan to make 
any major changes in response to 
theirperformanceatEmory. “Not 
looking at the scores,” Hollands 
said, “you’d think that we won. 
We have spirit, energy, and a 
strong work ethic. By working 
hard at every point, every ball, 
eventually those things will turn 
into wins.”
The Tartans’ match against 
Chatham College Wednesday 
night gave truth to Hollands’ 
words. In their last home match 
of the season, the Tartans swept 
a seemingly mismatched 
Chatham team 3-0 (15-1,15-1, 
15-3), outscoring them by a mar­
gin of 9-1. “We showed a lot of 
class,” said Skarada, “We got our 
plays down, gave everyone some 
playing time, and stayed at our 
level of play.”
“We really needed a good solid 
win,” added Hollands.
As for the rest ofthe season, the 
2-12 Tartans have two very spe­
cific objectives in mind. “Our 
goal for the season is to finish at 
.500 — to win as many as we 
lose,” explained Hollands, “Our 
goal for the UAA [championships] 
is to finish sixth. I think that’s 
definitely attainable.” Skarada is 
more optimistic. “We finished in 
6th place last season. We can 
definitely get 5th or 4th place 
this year,” she said. Fellow co­
captain Brennan insisted, “We’re 
going to take what we’ve learned

lumni tell of years gone by at CMU
Coming from a hellish high school, 
jprnegie Mellon was a haven for me 
d other bright students,” said Rich- 
'd Schall, a graduate of the class of 
969, as he reminisces of his college 
ays during this year’s Homecoming 
sstivities. An environment of intel- 
Jctually stimulating peers was only 
natural due to the integration of “three 
pltures” that still exist today: the 
Qgineering and science community, 
le c°llege of fine arts, and the liberal 
rts. While it did take effort on the 
art of the individual, Scholl feels that 
*ose who were able to experience all 
J*ee received the most from what 
'MU had to offer. He found that it 
as this interaction amongst peers 
*at gave CMU the reputation that it 
as Providing a “first-class educa- 
l0n— the students set this high stan- 
themselves, expecting as much
from each other as from themselves.”
Another graduate of ’69, Denise A. 
Schiller, found that “the environment 
stimulated independent thinkers dur­
ing a time of change. Carnegie Mellon 
was representative of the ’60s in that 
the three separate sects of the school 
lead to a non-cohesive student popula­
tion.” This was evident in the lack of 
spirit usually associated with big col­
lege events such as football games. 
Also typical of the period was drug 
use, which had grown to enormous 
proportions , especially in the the lib­
eral arts scene at CMU.
“You could go into Skibo and get 
almost anything you wanted,” recalls 
Scholl. “During grad school in New 
York, I would be commonly asked for 
various substances by many, upon 
hearing of my connection with 
Carnegie.” The same held true for al­
cohol.” — Schiller fails to remember 
any alcohol regulation on campus by 
police or other authorities, regardless 
of school policy. “As far as [substance
abuse] goes,” said Scholl, “there were 
three other divisions in the area: 
greek life, off campus (the predomi­
nant drug location) and dorm life, 
which meant no life.”
From the female point of view, 
Schiller never physically felt the 
dearth of women on campus; “the 
ratio was 3:1 —just right, I think.” 
Yet both she and Christina Von Saal 
Kuo, a fellow HSS ’69 graduate, rec­
ollect the rigid manner in which 
females were controlled during the 
early ’60s. “In loco parentes, they 
called it,” laughs Von Saal Kuo, 
“meaning in house parents.” House 
mothers would make weekly room 
checks — no messy dorm competi­
tions here — and 10 pm curfews. 
The women were subjected to re­
view by a disiplinary board when­
ever thes£ rules were violated. 
Schiller said, “I was always up for 
review 27 minutes after 10.” Judg­
ing from the laughter they express 
as they remember such events, it
couldn’t have been all bad. Not for Ms.
. Von Saal Kuo at least. “I loved it. I had 
a date every night.”
As for the academics, Scholl found 
that the engineers received creden­
tials, while the liberal arts students 
got an education. “In many Computer 
Science classes students were given a 
computer and told to have at it, while 
today they are walked through the 
programming. There was a lot of learn­
ing going on, but very little teaching.” 
During the last five years Scholl has 
seen the quality of education increase 
rapidly, due largely in part to efforts 
by President Mehrabian. “The changes 
he has brought about have greatly 
strengthened the undergraduate pro­
grams at CMU.” As a Carnegie Mellon 
graduate, Scholl finds that the men­
tion of the school causes intimidation 
amongst his peers. While its gradu­
ates aren’t always the forerunners and 
the policy makers, they are without a 
doubt in his mind, the movers and the 
shakers.
Retrospective glances back at 1969
On May 13 Dr. Wald, a professor at Harvard, spoke 
at the “March 4 Movement,” which was held at M.I.T., 
against nuclear weapons. The speech was mostly con­
cerned with the fact that graduating students feared 
for their lives, living under the Vietnam War, and in 
constant fear of nuclear weapons. He concluded by 
saying, “It has become one world, a world for all men. 
It is only such a world that now can offer us life and the 
chance to go on.”
In a news conference on October 5, President Richard 
Nixon said that he considered the students’ protests 
practically irrelevant compared to the national prob­
lems. He also said that, “As far as that kind of activity 
[protests on campus] is concerned, we expect it. How­
ever, under no circumstances will I be affected whatso­
ever by it.”
From October 14 to 15, a moratorium and march was 
held in protest of the Vietnam war. An estimated 
12,000 people marched in Pittsburgh, holding hands 
and singing “Give Peace a Chance” and “Down by the 
Riverside.”
Racial prejudice and bigotry were still very domi­
nant in 1969, even at CMU. In the year of’69-’70,5E of 
Morewood Gardens was an all Afro-American floor. 
This was a result of the program named Carnegie 
Mellon Action Program (CMAP), whose purpose was to 
integrate Afro-Americans into the university. Dean 
Shwank, then head of student affairs, said that the all 
black floor was created to encourage the new CMAP 
students academically and socially. None of the stu­
dents requested an all black floor, and none of them
knew it existed until they moved in.
Another example of the presence of and fight against 
racial discrimination had its climax late that Septem­
ber. Approximately 200 students, faculty, and con­
struction workers held a peaceful demonstration in 
front of construction taking place on campus.
The demonstration was in support of the Black 
Construction Coalition (BCC), which accused the uni­
versity of being discriminatory in its choice of con­
struction workers.
As a result of the demonstration, CMU President 
Stever addressed 1500 students, and said that while 
blocking construction was not the right way for the 
students to use their voice, he did not know exactly 
what the right way was.
Do we dare bring up drugs in 1969? Well, on Sep­
tember 19, Deputy Attorney General Richard G. 
Kleindienst, of the Nixon administration, announced 
that the U.S. was going to try to raise marijuana 
prices by a crack down on drug trafficking and “greater 
flexibility in prosecution” of drugs.
There is little doubt that 1969 was a year for change 
at Carnegie Mellon as it was a year for change all over 
the country. Much of what took place on campus went 
towards liberalizing the policies students now find 
themselves living with.
Many like to compare the sixties and the nineties, 
saying that the sixties was the age of student activism 
and the nineties is the age of student apathy. Perhaps 
in 25 years, this very space will tell all about what 
CMU’s current student body is doing now.

Do you remember Woodstock? How about Woodstock 
54? Well, if not, then that probably means you had a 
ood time. At any rate, Woodstock ’94 came this year 
ecause it is the 25th anniversary of Woodstock ’69. 
lus year is also the 25th anniversary of the ’69 
[omecoming. For the alumni of’69, and for the hippies 
n campus, this is a look back at 1969, and the goings- 
n around campus and around the world.
The first major activity on the CMU campus in the 
rear of1969 occured when the Male Dormitory Council 
ilong with the Association of Women Students pro- 
wsed that there be co-educational dorms by rooms, as 
ipposed to by wing or tower.
Since there are now co-educational rooms in 
lorewood, I think it is safe to assume this proposal
The Vietnam War was on everybody’s mind in early 
¡9. Students were being snatched from universities 
cross the nation, despite Nixon’s continuing promises 
, cut the draft.
On April 5,1969, a march for peace occurred in 30 
tates and included over 50,000 people. This was the 
irst march after Nixon’s term began, and was cer- 
ainly not the last. For example, a peace rally was held 
the Cut on Tuesday, May 6. Music accompanied 
ipeakers discussing draft resistance and the Vietnam 
Var. One speaker, Ed Fuller, told the graduating class 
if’69 that “We are tools, but we should not be.”

Female condom offers 
alternative for safe sex
By SHANNON GEBNEY
stintF 0nt""pi.nSi
As men and women of the ‘90s, most of us are 
aware of the dangers of unprotected sex. In fact, 
many of us can list the plethora of protective 
products that are available to sexually active 
couples verbatim.
We’ve all heard of birth control pills, (male) 
condoms, sponges, and diaphragms. However, 
most of us do not know that a new form of birth 
control entered the market in August.
This new-form of sexual protection is termed 
The Reality Female
“Women need a new option 
they can use to take care of 
themselves. ”
—Dr. Mary Ann Leeper
Condom, and its 
presence has been 
hailed as both revo­
lutionary and con­
troversial.
The Reality con­
dom functions by 
covering the cervix 
and the lines to the 
vaginal canal, thus 
preventing skin touching skin.
Its purpose is to reduce the risk of transfer of 
bacteria, sperm, and virus during intercourse. It 
is made of polyurethane, a durable, but thin 
material, which its proponents claim is 40 per­
cent stronger than its (male) latex condom coun­
terpart.
The device consists of a disposable barrier which 
is open on one end and closed on the other. It has 
two flexible rings: one is placed outside the va­
gina after insertion, and the other is used to 
insert the device and keep it steady over the 
cervix. The condom covers the labia and the 
bottom of the penis during sexual intercourse.
Reality comes in its package prelubricated, is 
disposable, and must be used for only one sexual 
act.
The product received approval from the FDA in 
May of last year. Under a six-month pregnancy 
study Reality yielded a 12.4 percent failure rate 
(incidence of pregnancy) among U.S. women, 
including product and user failure. This percent­
age was significantly reduced (2.6 percent) when 
the product was inserted correctly, with every 
sexual act.
Clinical studies also found the rate of breaks 
and tears for Reality at .2 percent-.8 percent.
These tests also found Reality’s sheath to be very 
capable in preventing the access of HIV, and 
other STDs like hepatitis B, the smallest known 
STD virus.
Wisconsin Pharmacal Company Inc., Reality’s 
manufacturer, posits the product’s benefits as: it jor drug store chains.
is the only device controlled by the women that 
protects against STDs, as well as unintended 
pregnancies; it does not interrupt the sex act, 
because erection is not necessary for use; it is 
made of polyurethane, which is unlikely to tear 
and does not produce allergic reactions to latex 
that afflict some people; and it is the only 
female condom obtainable in this country.
Proponents ofthe product assert that Reality’s 
presence on the market is forefront, particu­
larly now, when women are the fastest group of 
people infected with HIV.
“Women need a new option they can use to 
take care of them­
selves, particularly 
when the man can’t 
— or won’t wear a 
latex male con­
dom,” said Dr. 
Mary Ann Lee-per, 
president and CEO 
of the Female 
Health Company. 
However, in our
own campus community, as well as in commu­
nities across the country, Reality’s presence is 
not always viewed in such a positive light.
“It’s not a bad idea. I just don’t understand 
why protection always has to be the job of the 
woman,” said Laima Bashir, a freshman in 
H&SS.
“From all the tests I’ve read, it seems like it’s 
not as effective (as other forms of birth control), 
because it’s more likely to slip. I probably 
wouldn’t use one, for that reason,” said Davi 
Peraino, a sophomore H&SS student.
“Guys would just weasel out of more respon­
sibility,” said Perrin Roland, an H&SS fresh­
man. It is interesting to note that men were far 
more optimistic than women about the product. 
This may well provide support for the above 
claim of misplaced accountability.
“Guys tend to be more irresponsible because 
their not gonna have the child... so it’s better to 
give responsibility to the women,” said Michael 
Gartland, an H&SS junior.
“I think it’s definitely a good idea. Women 
should have the opportunity to protect them­
selves. If we can make the technology work for 
both genders, why not?” said Justin Maguire, a 
junior in industrial design.
Whatever your views, Reality is here to stay. 
Its retail price is $8.99 for a box of three, and 
$16.99 for a box of six. Reality is sold nation 
wide at independent pharmacies and grocery 
stores, many supermarket chains, and all ma-

We’ll begin this week’s column 
with a little discussion on censor­
ship and editorial control. First 
of all, my last column featured an 
error, in which the MBP was ex­
plicated by the meddling editor 
as a mashed baked potato (not as 
a microwaved one); however, the 
recipe then called for said MBP to 
be chopped, no doubt confusing 
many.
Furthermore, as some of you no 
doubt recall, the final paragraphs 
of this column were severely 
mangled several weeks ago. Now 
I, like many writers, such as the 
good Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, 
am often forced to phone in my 
weekly contribution from loca­
tions all over the globe.
There’s no telling where I might 
be, whether tracking down a revo­
lutionary recipe, saving the day 
in an oppressed Caribbean coun­
try with a new potato dish, or 
getting to the ugly truth behind 
the world’s pepper barons (vir­
tual potentates in their realms, 
capable at a moment’s whim of 
choking off the supply of this vi­
tal substance).
It was under these circum­
stances that the grammatical 
problems that must have so dis­
turbed my faithful readers arose. 
Originally my explanation for
said events appeared as part of 
my last column; however, 
editorship was unwilling to ac­
cept responsibility in this matter 
and therefore suppressed my dis­
cussion in hopes of whitewashing 
the entire issue, depending on 
the public’s notoriously short 
memory to allow the incident to 
fade into the past, going so far as 
to withold last week’s column. 
My readership, however, not be­
ing of the typical, callow sort, will 
not stand for such tyranny over 
freedom and honesty in public 
address.
This paragraph stands as testi­
mony to the power of yVH 4V4P’. 
(not the fluff piece at the back of 
this rag, but the overwhelming 
opinion of the 2V. 4V’’V. — the 
people).
Now that the civics lesson is 
over, let’s get cooking. You’ll need 
a good, stiff-backed knife for this 
week’s recipes.
Sauteed Summer Squash
Hurry to the store to get your 
yellow summer squash and the 
very last of the Vidalia onions. 
You’ll want to slice the squash 
very thinly (kind of tiresome, but 
worthwhile) and chop the onion 
coarsely (a fair amount if you 
secure the Vidalia; if not, skimp, 
as the flavor will be overpower­
ing).
Melt butter in a large frying 
pan (if you have it) and add the 
squash and onion on med-lo or 
low heat. Pepper heavily (of 
course), and stir occasionally un­
til the squash is translucent to 
the edges: it should have no 
crunch at all.
Be patient. I often add butter

fights for the animals
during the cooking. But that’s it 
— super simple. I’ve also done 
the recipe with zucchini, but it’s 
less sweet. A source close to the 
writer has described this dish as 
“my favorite thing in the world,” 
but try it and judge for yourself.
Sliced Potato, Tomato & co.
MBP, onion, garlic, tomato, 
oregano, basil
This recipe comes to Old Man 
Donner courtesy of Jesse P. 
Katrencik, in whose opinion it 
was a screwup, but we’ll see for 
ourselves.
This is prepared much like last 
week’s potato dish which, in turn, 
began much like my spaghetti 
sauce recipe: sauté chopped on­
ion and minced garlic in olive oil, 
adding tons of spices.
Now add thinly sliced potato 
(you can do this w/out microwav­
ing first, but it takes forever to 
cook thoroughly; however, it’s 
better sliced raw, so ‘wave it only 
three minutes or so) and, once it 
begins to become well browned, 
add the chopped tomato.
This time allow the mixture to 
cook on low (covered if you’ve a lid 
big enough) for awhile, until it 
becomes a somewhat mushy, al­
most casserole-looking dish. In 
fact, you could even stick it in the 
oven, sprinkled with parmesan, 
until you got a bit of a crust to it. 
Mmmm ... like a Dove bar, but 
cheese and potatoes, not choco­
late and ice cream: Munchy- 
squishy ... Oh, yeah — and pep­
pery. As if n2tnbr a surprise.^

“Cut it out or we’ll shut you 
down.” That’s the message Cap­
tain Paul Watson- and the Sea 
Shepherd Conservation Society 
are sending out with their daring 
campaigns to protect marine 
wildlifeto illegal whalers . Since 
its founding in 1977, the Sea 
Shepherd Society has been in­
volved in ramming and sinking 
ships of several illegal whaling 
vessels.
The tactics of • 
the Society have 
been criticized by 
many as radical 
and violent. “I al­
ways find this 
somewhat laugh­
able,” Watson 
says smiling, “I 
can’t think of a 
single person 
who has been in­
jured or killed by 
an environmen­
talist, but the me­
dia perception is 
that we are vil­
lainous, terror­
ists and crimi­
nals.”
Watson de­
scribes his tactics as “agressive 
nonviolent.” They use such comi­
cal weapons as a pie cannon, 
which they use to shoot pie filling 
at whaling ships. They also use 
stink bombs, water cannons, 
paint ball guns, and buteric acid 
bombs delivered by model air­
planes to the decks of whaling 
ships. They also have civil war 
cannons on board, which are not 
used to actually fire projectiles 
but which make quite a loud and 
effective show.
In 1975, Watson lead a 
Greenpeace campaign to save 
whales. “I had come up with this 
idea that we could actually inter­
vene and protect the whales by 
putting our own bodies between 
the harpoons and thè whales.” 
And that’s exactly what they did.
“For the first 20 minutes while 
we were blocking that harpoon, I 
really felt it would work, and it 
was an incredible moment. I 
looked behind me and there was 
a 150 foot steel ship that was 
bearing down on us at 20 knots. 
In front of us, only 15 feet in front 
of us, was a magnificent pod of 
sperm whales, eight of them, and 
they were fleeing for their lives. 
Every time the harpooner moved 
his harpoon cannon, we moved 
our boat in front of his harpoon, 
and the Russian captain came 
down the catwalk, walked up to 
the harpooner, yelled something 
in his ear, turned to us, brought 
his finger across his throat, and 
then walked back to the bridge... 
The next time that the whales 
went up in a swell, as did the 
ship, and we descended into a 
trough, we heard this horrendous 
explosion, and 150 pound gre­
nade roared over our heads and 
impacted into the back side of one 
of the whales, and the whale 
screamed.”
The first whale they hit was a 
female. They always hit the fe-

dominant bull whale will attack 
to defend the other females. 
Watson and his crew had been 
warned that the bull whale would 
attack the smallest target to de­
fend the other females. In this 
case, the smallest target was 
Watson’s boat.
“I saw this one whale rise up
male first in a pod of sperm pouring down on us and I coulc 
whales, because they know the reach up and touch its six incl
teeth that were right there. ys’
I looked up into this eye, an eye 
the size of my fist, and what I saw 
there was understanding, that 
the whale understood what we 
were trying to do, because the 
easiest thing for the whale to do 
at that point was to come forwari] 
and crush us or seize us in d•_ 
and dive, and it was with a great jaws, and it did neither. Instead, 
deal of anxiety that we sat there it very slowly slid back into the 
in this little rubber boat, waiting water, eye-to>eye contact all the

From that point 
on, Watson 
determined 
dedicate his life ti 
protecting the 
whales. In 1977 
he left Green­

son that his activi-

kind of organization. The vision­
aries were being forced out and 
the organization was being taken

whale throw himself out of the 
water, hurl himself straight at

him with a harpoon ... and this

Now there were two whales

its eye. It saw us, and it dove 
again.
This time we could see it headed

Undergrad publishes piece 
on Pittsburgh ghost stories
By ANGELA MALLOY
stintF Crr.rntFn fSpr -«.nVi
In the little bit of spare time that CMU 
students are allotted during the week 
we usually:
a) try and have fun
b) participate in extra-curricular ac­
tivities or
c) write books.
While I was doing a and b, Beth 
Trapani, a creative writing major 
with second semester sophomore 
status, was writing a book entitled 
]2Vrn 0nVi.Sr V" /.nnr­Pie2 tF« C’J
’Se2SFB aVPFnBW Trapani’s book was 
published in August and sales have 
been good enough that a reprint has 
been ordered.
But it all started back in summer 
of ’93. “I was doing morning drive 
news at the radio station WEEU in 
Reading, Pa,” said Trapani. Charlie 
Adams, the station’s “morning guy” 
was the author of 13 books on ghost 
stories, legends, and folklore. 
Trapani and Adams developed a good 
rapport while working together and 
soon Trapani offered to help Adams 
research a book in the works. Adams’ 
books were unique in that each book 
published included stories specific 
to a certain region like liis books 
at4S YtB ]2Vrn 0nVi.Sr and gSeJ
SF«r V" gVFe lSto2 1r’tF«W
The two continued to discuss the 
possibility of working together and as 
Trapani said, “Pittsburgh had nothing 
like this.”
From there they decided to develop a 
book on the topic. Trapani began to help 
with the research of the book, then she 
was helping Adams write the book, and 
soon, she was doing all of it on her own.
But writing a book on ghosts involves 
more then just you and your typewriter. 
Trapani had to do some investigation
and said she “went through an informal 
ghost hunting apprenticeship.” Adams 
takes tours out in Berks County near 
Halloween and points out places ru­
mored to be haunted.
She began her research in Pittsburgh 
in the fall of’93. Trapani decided to try 
and get the book finished by the Spring 
of’94 and the best way to do that was to 
go into it full force. She took Spring

Beth Trapani, CMU undergrad, took a semester 
off to finish a book about Pittsburgh ghost stories
semester off from CMU and instead spent 
her time writing, researching, and in­
terning in the Public Relations Depart­
ment of the Greater Pittsburgh Conven­
tion and Visitors Bureau.
Trapani continued to consult Adams 
during the writing process. She said 
“after working with Charlie at the radio 
station I was very confident that with 
his support we could do this together.” 
Within the actual text, Adams provided
an introduction and “editorial direction,” 
said Trapani. On the cover, Adams’name 
does appear under Trapani’s to, as she 
said, “give it a little bit of background.”
Trapani began her search for the 
strange and unusual with newspaper 
articles that appeared around Hallow­
een.
There are several popular ghost sto­
ries passed by word of mouth around the 
city about such sites as the Pitts­
burgh Playhouse, Millvale Church, 
the steel mills, and Chatham Col­
lege.
Some of these older or more famous 
tales “were written many times 
throughout the years, and it was in­
teresting to see how the story evolved 
over time,” said Trapani. But it was 
not just a matter of re-printing old 
newspaper articles. Trapani said “ev­
ery story you will read, I made con­
tact with someone.” Although there 
are books published about supernatu­
ral stories, and too many special tele­
vision programs, Trapani said, “what 
makes [her book] unique is it’s a book 
of Pittsburgh ghost stories.”
Now, it’s really only when you are 
having success that you plan for an 
event like a sequel and so far “sales 
are excellent,” said Trapani. The 
Waldenbooks store in Monroeville 
sold 125 copies of Trapani’s book in a 
week. The original printing was 5,000 
copies, and a second is on its way.
Trapani said ]2Vrn 0nVi.Sr is “not in­
tended to be a ponderous piece of litera­
ture. It’s just a book of ghost stories.” 
What would please her is if parents 
picked up a copy and read it to their kids 
on a dark and eerie Halloween night. 
But she is even more flexible. She 
wouldn’t mind if her book became an 
“Uncle John’s bathroom reader.’’Trapani 
said, “I’m pleased to be in the bathrooms 
of Pittsburgh.”
Gender seminars 
educate campus
By ALLIE KING
stintF Crr.rntFn IStnPiSr aVR-«.nVi
Although as college students we may 
not be too keyed in on the global news 
(or the national news for that matter), 
there are events and seminars on cam­
pus, or nearby, offering many oppor­
tunities for discussion about the is­
sues that we face now, and those that 
we will face after leaving.
The University of the 21 st Century: 
A focus on Gender (U2C1), is a series 
of brown-bag luncheon seminars avail­
able to everyone from Pitt and CMU, 
providing an opportunity for students 
and faculty from both schools to ex­
plore together the changes and chal­
lenges faced by the Universities in the 
future.
U2C1, as well as another series cel­
ebrating graduate students of color, 
was startedby Barabara Lazarus, the 
Associate Provost for Academic 
Projects, with her staff in the Special 
Projects office of CMU, and Mary Lou 
Soff, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts 
and Sciences Office of Graduate stu­
dents at Pitt. The series evolved from 
last year’s Women Speaker Series 
which was also sponsored in conjunc­
tion with Pitt, making this year the 
second presentation of the U2C1. 
The series targets topics such as the 
intersection of race and gender, and 
how computer science became 
gendered male. The seminars use a 
published article as a starting point 
for an open discussion about the issue 
at hand. The articles are available at 
the Reserve desk at Hunt Library, or 
at the Special Projects Office in 
Warner Hall 419.
This past Thursday, the first of the 
U2C1 series was held in the CMU 
Student Activities Center. The topic
was “Faculty of the 21st Century: 
Will Tenure Survive?” The hour-long 
discussion focused on tenure in uni­
versities, and how it coexists with 
gender problems.
According to the National Science 
Foundation’s “Indicators of Science 
and Mathematics Education, 1992”, 
in all fields, women hold about 30 
percent of full-time instructional fac­
ulty positions, but only 2 percent in 
engineering, and less than 10 per­
cent in natural sciences. Only 18 
percent of women scientists and engi­
neers at four-year institutions are 
full professors compared with 46 per­
cent of the men.
The next discussion will be led by 
Carla Smith, associate dean of fac­
ulty of arts and sciences, and Philip 
Smith, associate professor and chair 
of English (both of Pitt), who will 
explore the assumptions and impli­
cations of privelege in institutions of 
higher education. The published ar­
ticle they will be using is entitled 
“White Privelege: Unpacking the In­
visible Knapsack.” The discussion will 
be held on October 27, at noon, in 
Pitt’s Babcock Room on the 40th floor 
of the Cathedral of Learning.
After October 27, the seminars will 
occur through April: “From Ida to 
Gameboy: How Computer Science 
Became Gendered Male,” (Thurs. De­
cember 1, at noon, in the Student 
Activities Center of CMU), “The Acad­
emy as a Gendered Institution” 
(Thurs. Jan. 26, at noon in the CMU 
Student Activities Center, room 210), 
“Do the Sciences Have a Gender” 
(Pitt’s Babcock Room), and “Desegre­
gation or Empowerment: the Impact 
of ‘Exclusive’ Events in the 
Academy”(CMU Student Activities 
Center).
Messy dorm rooms may 
yield prizes for pigstyes
By SUSAN WATSON
stintF OPF.Vi 0nt""pi.nSi
College students are not known 
for keeping particularly neat liv­
ing habits, especially when con­
sidering their dorm rooms. Of 
course, it’s great to not have Mom 
and Dad nagging us on a daily 
basis to make our beds and to 
remove our clothes from the floor 
that hasn’t been vacuumed for 
days.
Face it, when it 
comes to cleanli­
ness, college stu­
dents tend to be re­
versing the evolu­
tionary process.
Within the short 
month that we’ve 
been at school we 
have grown accus­
tomed to the inches 
of dust that have ac­
cumulated on every 
stationary object in 
our happy college 
homes. Just when 
we thought it couldn’t get any 
• better, Milton Bradley created a 
competition entitled Milton 
Bradley’s Pass the Pigs Search­
ing for the Biggest Campus Pig­
sty.
The competition, which Milton 
Bradley hopes to sponsor on a 
yearly basis, is the perfect chance 
for college students who main­
tain extremely unkempt rooms 
to win a number of prizes.
That’s right — you can win re­
ally cool prizes for your slovenly 
habits just by sending a picture 
of your trashed room and a brief
nal entries. They hope to get a 
large number of applications from 
students from all over the coun­
try based on the attention the 
board game Pass the Pigs has 
been getting, primarily from col-(MUITOIH IÎM

A winner will be selected from 
each of the 50 states as well as a

The 50 national winners will

each receive Pass the Pigs game, 
t-shirts and other prizes. The 
grand prize winner of the contest 
will receive $1,000, a professional 
room cleaning, an on campus 
party for 100 of his or her closest 
friends and acquaintances, and a 
Milton Bradley prize pack.
Milton Bradley is looking for a 
wide range of diverse and origi-
executive at Milton Bradley and 
a spokeswoman for the contest 
explained, “Because Pass the Pigs 
is targeted to college students 
and they are excited about the 
game, we feel that 
the Campus Pigsty 
Competition will be 
a huge success. We 
have received a 
great deal of appli­
cations and are look­
ing forward to re­
ceiving more.”
To participate in 
the Milton Bradley 
Pigsty Search, send 
a 4" x 6" photo and a 
brief description of 
why you feel you are 
proud of your “pig­
sty.” Contestants 
must also have a resident advisor 
sign their application so to be 
sure that no damage has been 
added to the room on purpose. 
Entries must be postmarked no 
later than November 1 to:

it is “an enforcement organiza­

We knew that there were a 
Jot of laws and regulations in 
international waters that were 
there but really didn’t mean 
anything, because nobody was 
enforcing them, and that’s what
we set out to enforce.”
Watson and his Society have 
many enemies. Few people are 
ready to accept his tactics. He 
has been called a radical, mili­
tant, terrorist, criminal, and pi­
rate, but this matters little to 
Watson.
“We’re not out here to win any 
popularity contests. We’re here 
to piss people off. We’re here to
say things people don’t want to 
hear, and we’re here to take 
actions that people don’t want 
to see being taken, to rock the 
boat, to make waves.”
“We live on a river of time,” 
Watson explains. '
“What happens up that river 
affects us today, and what we 
do today affects all the chil­
dren tomorrow.”

Laddergrams
by Mark Kantrowitz
In a laddergram, the object 
is to transform the word 
on the top rung into the 
word on the bottom rung 
in the least number of 
steps. During each step 
you must replace one 
letter in the previous word 
so that a new word is 
formed, but without 
changing the positions of 
the other letters. For 
example, we can change 
LEAD into GOLD in just 
three steps: LEAD, LOAD, 
GOAD, GOLD.

PARTNERSHIP FOR A DRUG-FREE AMERICA
YOU’RE LOOKING AT TWO 
COMPLETELY OPPOSITE, FUNDAMENTALLY 
DIFFERENT WAYS TO INVEST IN STOCKS. 
WE RECOMMEND BOTH.
Introducing the CREF Growth Account and the CREF Equity Index Account.
Whether you want a fund that 
selects specific stocks or one that 
covers the market, we're on the same page. 
Our new CREF Growth and CREF 
Equity Index Accounts use two distinct 
strategies for investing in the stock mar­
ket, but both aim to provide what every 
smart investor looks for: long-term 
growth that outpaces inflation.*
The CREF Growth Account searches 
for individual companies that are 
poised for superior growth. In contrast, 
the Equity Index Account looks for more 
diversification, with a portfolio encom­
passing almost the entire range of U.S. 
stock investments. It will invest in stocks
in the Russell 3000®,** a broad index of 
U.S. stocks.
Like our CREF Stock Account, which 
combines active, indexed, and foreign 
investing, and our Global Equities 
Account, which actively seeks opportuni­
ties worldwide, the new funds are managed 
by experienced investment professionals. 
They’ re the same experts who have helped 
make TIAA-CREF the largest pension 
system in the U.S., managing over $130 
billion in assets.
To find out more about our new stock 
funds, and building your portfolio with 
TIAA-CREF, just call 1 800-842-2776.

mance is solid, menacing because of his 
quick shifts between the comic and thé 
serious.
In the New York production four years 
ago, director Michael Greif said that his
gun. Treadwell’s objective, as she noted 
in the script, was to capture the “brassy 
sound” and repetitiveness of city speech.
Virtually lost in obscurity, Sophie The dialogue is similar to that of David
eadwell’s 1928 expressionist play Mamet's, but Treadwell does not see it
Xo2.Ft’ (ma kee NAHL) has seen ma- as a poetic device, nor is it crafted to any design team envisioned the nine epi-
¦evival attempts in New York in other end beyond that of showingus that sodes of the play as nine prisons for

arnegie Mellon’s Kresge theater. The characters in Treadwell’s drama Sara Chazen took a similar approach
Yto2.Ft’ was directed by graduate are not designated by name; they are in the staging in Kresge. In the first
episode, Young Woman 
is trapped downstage 
by her co-workers or in 
George H Jones’s office. 
Except for episodes five 
and six, when she 
meets a Man (Patrick 
Wilson), Chazen’s 
picturization is accu­
rate.
However it is clearly 
Young Woman’s choice 
to go with Man (a role 
originated in 1928 by a 
young Clark Gable) and 
to sleep with him. That 
she cries for pity in epi­
sode two and then com­
mits adultery by choice 
makes it impossible to 
have any sympathy for 
her character. That she 
cries for freedom and 
has it for two episodes 
makes it impossible to 
believe that she really 
is trapped.
Miss Sentman makes 
the only choice possible: 
Young Woman is not only uneducated, 
but neurotic. She is from the beginning, 
in the way she threatens her mother, 
and this leaves her character nowhere to 
go, no struggle, no obstacle to overcome.
She is a tragic heroine with many 
tragic flaws—but she is not even heroic.
Women’s right to vote was ratified 
only eight years prior to the premiere of 
Yto2.Ft’W Treadwell intended for her 
play to have a feminist message. In her 
various roles through the nine episodes, 
Young Woman is alienated from the 
roles imposed on her by patriarchal soci­
ety: daughter, wife, patient, mother, 
lover, defendant, Christian.
Treadwell specifies in the stage direc­
tions that the doctors are to write in 
Latin. The strategy of her defense law­
yer is to portray her squarely within 
accepted female boundaries: she is a 
“good wife” with a “happy marriage.” 
The male-dominated court views a 
“happy marriage” as one in which there 
are no quarrels.
The male lawyers construct Young
Woman’s story for 
her: “You meant your 
husband’s r.«S of the 
bed, didn’t you?”
In the last episode, 
a male priest domi­
nates the final mo­
ments of Young 
Woman’s life. Similar 
to Mamet’s A’StFFtT 
the female character 
articulates her frus­
tration with an ab­
stract system that 
doesn’t speak to her 
at all (from Ginger 
Strand’s “Treadwell’s 
Neologism: Yto2.FJ
t’,” Theatre Journal 
44,1992). Like the fe­
male character in 
A’StFFtT Young Woman is told by soci­
ety that she’s crazy, she’s late, she’s 
“gotta get married.” However, in 1928 
there is no “group” to which Young 
Woman can turn for support.
But today for a woman to be trapped 
as Young Woman is, to be denied educa­
tion and “opportunity” to the extent that 
she is in Yto2.Ft’T is unheard of. We see 
that everything that happens to Young 
Woman is her own fault. The Kresge
Ruth Snyder recovers after giving birth.
The Kresge production dragged pain­
fully during the precarious set changes 
which sometime took over two minutes 
of stage time. The New York production 
was called a “blinding, pounding perfor­
mance” by Edith Oliver of s2S fSp 
7Vi9SiT but I bet she would have pre­
ferred that to the slow tedium in Kresge.
To further the play’s message of the 
industrial forces at work, the set changes 
needed to be a choreographed, precision
foe court scene in Machinal: Ruth Snyder, played by Kristin Sentman, is tried and convicted of 
nurdering her husband. Machinal is based on the true-llfe Snyder-Gray murder case of the 1920s when, 
for the first time in history, a woman was executed by electrocution.
itudent Sara Chazen in partial fulfill- 
\ent of the requirements for the degree 
Master of Fine Arts, and it was one of 
the strongest MFA projects in quite some 
^e. Yto2.Ft’ is not an easy script. It is 
ased on the widely publicized Snyder- 
Jray murder case of the 1920s: a woman, 
ith Snyder, is tried and convicted of 
urdering her husband — and for the 
•sttime in American history, a woman 
executed by electrocution. The play is 
¡o about alienation and dehumaniza- 
jion in a technological age.
'echnology was certainly a design el- 
lent: the huge set contained an eleva- 
jr, an airport-style conveyer belt, a mass 
|fmachinery underneath the floor, and 
silhouette of interlocking gears on the 
ickdrop behind the set. In the opening 
ine we see characters at an office do- 
Ig mechanized, repetitive tasks: filing, 
iyping, answering phones. The action is 
ipported by Treadwell’s dialogue; char­
ters speak in staccato words and 
)hrases — rapid-fire language that 
iunds as if it were fired from a machine
anonymous city dwellers.
The main character is noted in the 
script simply as “Young Woman,” por­
trayed with intense emotion by Kristin 
Sentman.
Miss Sentman, as the victim of all this 
technology, is mesmerizing to watch; 
the minute beat work ofY oung Woman’s 
monologues reveal scattered, random 
thought in the fractured language of a 
technological era; we follow breathlessly 
as her mind reels from one thought to 
another: . . — somebody — some­
thing — no rest — must rest—no rest
— must rest — no rest — late today — 
yesterday—before — late — subway— 
air — pressing — bodies — pressing — 
bodies — trembling — air — stop — air
— late —job — no job — fired — late — 
alarm clock — alarm clock — alarm 
clock — hurry — . . ..”
Young Woman decides — or is forced
— to marry George H. Jones (Christian 
Borle), a repulsive man with “fat hands.” 
Though Borle’s character is one-sided, 
as are all the characters, his perfor-

production was stylistically done in the 
’20s; we are reminded through the cos­
tumes and music. But it is impossible for 
a modem audience to understand the 
repression of women at that time.
More than simply too dated, 
Treadwell’s play is only half complete. 
“A woman who is trapped” does not make 
a play; rather, we get a display of ma­
chinery, caricatures, and suffering: a 
designer’s dream, a director’s nightmare.
machine unto themselves, with a back­
ground of city noise just as the gears on 
the silhouette were a background to the 
play.
The final lines are a succint summa­
tion. Young Woman cries out for “Some­
body! Somebod—’’ when her voice is cut 
off. The final “y” — or “why” — is left 
unspoken, unanswered. It is the riddle 
of this play that perhaps no production 
will ever be able to adequately solve.

Since their debut e.p. a2iVF.o

changes, from the rock feel of

]iSSFH ending last at the acous­
tic chunk of sound that is CPnVJ
mtn.o IVi s2S /SV4’SW For each 
time they have made a change, 
it has never affected their suc­
cess. Everybody knows “It’s the 
End of the World As We Know It 
(And I Feel Fine)” (or at least a 
few lines of it, anyway), and MTV 
junkies have thrilled to the pop 
hits like “Stand,” “Losing. My 
Religion,” and “Everybody 
Hurts.” The sound seemed to be 
progressing inwardly, however, 
and the band was losing its hard 
edge. That was then.
YVFrnSi takes every bit of re­
straint ever felt by each of the 
members of the Athens quartet, 
every ounce of hard rock power 
repressed for the last nine al­
bums, every nasty solo that 
never got through the process­
ing for fear of inaccessibility, 
and lets it all out like a flooding 
dam. But there’s no stopping 
this flood; for all 12 numbers, 
the fabled team of Berry/Buck/ 
Mills/Stipe rock us like they’ve 
never rocked us before. From
the first overdriven strains of 
“What’s the Frequency, Ken­
neth?,” R.E.M. rides waves of dis­
tortion into a sea of electric wind 
and turmoil. The mellowest song, 
“Strange Frequencies,” sounds 
like someone put “Everybody

“I’m not your King of Comedy/

R.E.M.’s sound has changed yet again with Monster.

“I Don’t Sleep, I Dream” borrows 
a progression from “Losing My 
Religion,” digressing to give the 
listener a soulful, funky falsetto 
in the refrain. “King of Comedy” 
puts a flange effect on Michael 
Stipe’s vocals to create a sound 
that Flood would have proudly 
produced, with a female vocalist
took a little bit of getting used to 
(the change is a shock) — was 
really quite a good effort at 
grunging up the quickly fading 
image of R.E.M., and a large step 
in the right direction for them. 
They have used their 10th album 
to rebirth themselves, and we can 
only hope that they continue to 
develop in this manner.

Kite gives glimpse of 
revolutionary China
By WLADIMER LABEIKOVSKY
stintF 0nt""pi.nSi
At the beginning of 77ie l’PS !.nS we see a shot 
of (appropriately enough) a blue kite against the 
sky, drifting, like the soul of a child, through the 
wind and the trees. That’s the main theme of s2S 
l’PS !.nST a film by Tian Zhuangzhuang. Al­
though it is set against the epic background of a 
country that seems to be in perennial revolution, 
it is most of all, the epic of a single boy growing 
in an environment filled with both fear and 
comfort.
The portrayal of China’s witch-hunt during 
the ’50s and '60s on the bri nk of the so called 
Cultural Revolution, got this film banned in 
China, and now Zhuangzhuang can’t make any­
more films there.
The film is not essentially political or subver­
sive, but the sincerity that is embedded on the 
story seemed to be enough for the government. 
The film is said to be based on the experiences of 
Zhuangzhuang and his friends during this pe­
riod, as he said: ‘The stories in the film are 
real....”
The film is divided in three segments, corre­
sponding with the three “fathers" ( dad, uncle and 
stepfather) that young Tietou goes through dur­
ing the film. They also roughly correspond with 
the different types of “witches” that get chased in 
the span of 12 years during China’s Great Leap 
Forward. First, you must be a good communist 
and a good comrade, afterwards you must be a 
good revolutionary, and later on you must be a 
really good revolutionary because if not, you get 
sent to labor camp — or worse — to jail.
This is a time where if you go to the restroom 
at the wrong time during a meeting, you can be 
accused of being a rightist. This is a time where 
becoming member of the Party is a cherished 
goal in life.
Curiously enough, this setting of forced com­
munal fear and fanatism is presented against 
Tietou’s small community. They live around a 
courtyard where neighbors are always eager to 
help each other and share what they have, 
without really needing Party members blaring 
their lungs out along the streets. One thing that 
the film shows is how simple living together can 
be, and how short-lived it becomes when polities 
or the military (more often both) try (and suc­
ceed) to impose their system.
However, one ofthe best things about this film 
is that all its political comments are not thrown 
at the viewer, but rather form a rather second­
ary background. Zhuangzhuang is more inter­
ested in presenting the story of the child and his 
family. He does this by filling it with small 
details that create an odd sense of intimacy, as 
if there were spirits around the people in the 
story. At various times during the film, if we 
listen closely we can hear a strange (but subtle) 
sound, like a voice that cannot speak. And in 
most indoors scenes, Zhuangzhuang pans the 
camera around the characters in a way that is 
more like faint caresses than camera movement.
He wants to tell not the story of a country but 
of.its people. Too bad some don’t let him.

Shop, haggle in Strip
aiP.r.Fb .F n2S blPie2
by Christina Farrell
If you find the produce at Giant 
Eagle inadequate, do your shop­
ping at the Strip District. Not 
only are you able to get some 
great specialty food, but you’ll 
find that each store in the 
Strip District has its own 
unique personality.
My first stop was the USA 
Gourmet where I bought an 
assortment of delicious past­
ries to eat while shopping.
Later on, I stopped into an­
other great bakery, 
Napoleon’s. As I was walking 
in, the man behind me ex­
plained to his kids, “People 
come from all over the city for 
this bakery.”
Judging from the long lines be­
hind the counter, he was abso­
lutely right. It’s easy to see why 
from the wide selection of bread 
lining the shelves.
The Strip District is one of the 
best places in the city to find 
authentic Italian food. Two great 
examples are Jimmy and Nino 
Sunseri Co. and The Pennsylva­
nia Macaroni Co. Inc.
The Sunseri Bros, have been 
located in the Strip District since
1902. The smell of fresh pizza 
from an outside stand drew us 
toward the store. There was also 
a variety of pastries — including 
canoli — and Italian cookies.
To make your own Italian mas­
terpieces, The Pennsylvania 
Macaroni Co. Inc. has everything 
you’ll need. There are five gallon 
buckets filled to the brim with 
olives and a counter stacked high 
with cheese wheels. No matter

If you feel the need for vegeta­
tion in your life, step into Jungle 
City. They have every kind of 
plant from cacti to potted trees. 
Even if you aren’t in the market 
for plants, it’s worth stopping in 
just to see the bonsai trees.
But, if you are planning on 
starting your own bonsai garden, 
be aware that the starters begin 
at $50 and older trees can cost
into the hundreds.For a chang< 
of pace, I paid a visit to “The 
Party King,” Mike Feinberg. The 
shelves rose to the ceiling and 
were filled from top to bottom 
with every party supply imagin- 
able. Although my purpose in 
stopping was to pick up some 
Halloween decorations, I, al 
with the employees, spent most 
of my time just playing with the 
toys. My last stop was Wholey’s 
Fish Market, which did not have 
quite the same alluring aroma as 
the bakeries, but is a well-known 
Pittsburgh trademark offerings 
not only seafood, but fresh pro­
duce, as well.
If you’re looking for fresh food, 
flowers, authentic Asian, Italian 
or other hard-to-find foods check 
out the Strip.
If you’re not after bulk food, 
take an afternoon visit and 
sample the food from the street 
vendors: tasty and cheap ($l-$2 
per serving).
The streets are also lined with 
booths of unique jewelry, im-: 
ported goods, and a variety of 
other great stuff to bargain over. 
Most prices accommodate a col­
lege student’s budget, especially 
if you’re a talented haggler.

stintFWLame art, writing result again from Image with Hellshock
aVm.o lVV9 a2iVF.o’Sr
by Jason Andracki
Lately it seems to be rather trendy in 
the comic book world to bash Image 
Comics. Both John Byrne (OV2F lBiFSbr 
fSHn YSF, lt­S8 and Peter David Z1FJ
oiS«.­’S &P’9TC5PtnFtF8 have publicly 
criticized Image for various reasons. I 
figure I’m in good company when I say 
that Image’s latest offerine&S’’r2Vo9 #2 
is one of the worst books of the year. Sure 
it’s only two issues old (actually one and 
half since the premier issue only had a 
16 page story, pinups, and a failed story 
that was printed anyway) but it’s only a 
four issue limited series (unless sales 
are good, then it will become an ongoing 
series) so we’re half way through it, and 
it’s fair to judge it now.
I honestly went into this with an open 
mind (I anticipated the book actually) 
even though Jae Lee, the creator of 
&S’’r2Vo9T drove me away from Marvel’s
ftmVi with his scratchy, unclear art­
work. After all his work (both words and 
pictures) on the L.’«aWCWsWr si.’VeBT 
was quite commendable.
The concept for the book was very 
appealing; an angel impregnates a young 
girl, gets damned to Hell, son is born, 
has powers but is pretty messed up men­
tally, probably fights father for life of his 
mother. Although not a cheery story, it 
reeked of originality so it found its way 
into my bag, both issues plus an ashcan 
(black and white copy) too.
The first target of my barrage shall be 
the art. First off, Jae Lee drove me away 
from one title already with his bleak art. 
He’s the brother of Jim Lee. Although 
his storytelling is around the same level 
as Jim, regretfully comparing Jae’s art 
to Jim’s is like comparing lSty.r tF« 
lPnn2St« to z: Y.FPnSrW Sure Mike 
Mignola (&S’’­VBT ciW cVVm tF« ciW 
0nitFeSRWsiteS«B tF« sVimSFn) covers 
his art in shadow but you can still com­
prehend what’s happening.
With Jae Lee however, you have to 
stare at each panel, not to enjoy the 
detail, but to try and decipher what’s 
happening since the art is so drab, shad­
owy, and rough. Actually most of the 
ashcan and the failed half of story from 
issue one, is in black and white which

actually makes the art 
more understandable. 
So, perhaps the prob­
lem doesn’t lie with Lee 
but actually with the 
colorist Jose Villar- 
rubia.
Now on to the writ­
ing. Although the con­
cept is great, something 
has happened to 
&S’’r2Vo9 from develop­
ment to the first two 
issues. Since it’s only a 
four issue limited series, 
it seems Lee is trying to 
cram in too much and in 
turn, he’s not explain­
ing enough of any of the 
stories he’s attempting 
to tell.
There are four sub­
plots (everything is a 
subplot because Lee 
hasn’t shown what the 
main story is yet) that 
have yet to go anywhere 
with the series being 
halfway over. As far as 
characterization goes... 
well, we do know the 
names ofthe characters.
What I think we have here is Image’s 
attempt to leech onto the popularity of 
DC’s Vertigo line Z0tF«mtFT &S’’­’tqSiT 
CF.mt’ YtFT etc.) much the way they 
earlier tried with the failed cti9Si 1mJ
teSW
This is a shame because the concept of | 
&S’’r2Vo9 is a good one, but Jae Lee is) 
floundering with it. Perhaps he should 
take a cue from his brother and turn thej 
characters over to someone-more skilled 
in this pseudo-horror genre like Garth' 
Ennis Z&S’’­’tqSi8 or, it gives me chills 
just to think of it, J.M. DeMatteis Zl’VV«D< 
C st’ST YVVFr2t«Vp8 and be satisfied 
with “created by Jae Lee.”
Well, since it’s only two more issues 
long, I’m going to stick with &S’’r2Vo9 
(besides, Bill Sienkiewicz Z0nitB sVtrnJ
Sir8 is doing a pinup for issue three). 
Maybe Lee will straighten out his 
storytelling abilities and provide us with 
the story his idea deserves.

probably all you or I have heard through a few obscure numbers, 
of him. And I don’t expect that to hamming it up with Ringo Starr 
change. and Merle Haggard on a few, and
leaves the listener a little more 
relaxed and mildly annoyed at 
the lack of substance.
A few songs stand out as pleas­
ant and very listenable. “Dancin’ 
On Daddy’s Shoes” has a nice 
swing to it and describes the nos­
talgic image of a country dance. 
“Truckin’ 101” is a song about 
leaving your blues at home and 
going out on the road. “I’m Crazy 
’Bout My Baby” is a ditty about a 
girl.
Note, once again, the lack of 
substance, but sometimes that’s 
nice. And who better to sing about 
fluff than the soothing Leon Red­
bone. As Redbone says in “Dancin’ 
on Daddy’s Shoes”: “There’s noth­
ing else I’d rather do/ Than sit 
around and talk to you/ and remi­
nisce about a simpler time.” 
That’s exactly what he does.
A good album to relax to, the 
whole thing conjures up sitting 
on a porch with a snifter of brandy 
and watching the sun go down 
and hearing the crickets come 
out. However, those halcyon days 
seem to be gone and Redbone has 
little to say or sing about modern 
culture.
And again, this fact isn’t that 
poignant and shouldn’t interfere 
with listening pleasure. 
Redbone’s L2.rn’.Fe .F n2S L.F« 
is a delightful and slow walk 
through the old South that only

A Clockwork Orange
Directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1971, A Clockwork 
Orange examines the love and courage of a group of 
young people who are forced to survive by kicking 
the yarbles of old, stinking, vonny drunks. Based on 
a novel by Anthony Burgess, Kubrick’s work is 
violent and has many adult themes. So hide your 
eyes at the dirty parts.
Starring a bunch of English actors who are prob­
ably doing children’s programs right now, the pace is 
fast and the fists, boots and plots are flying. Thank­
fully, the language in the film has been mostly 
translated from the Slavik-based slang of Burgess’ 
novel and is easy to understand and fairly enjoyable. 
Not a good date movie unless you and your par 
amour are into S&M.
At 5, 7:30,10pm, and 12:30 am.

Reality Bites
Yes, Viriginia, reality does bite. And Winona Ryder 
and a bunch of other artsy people want to tell you 
about it. This film is a documentary on Generation 
Xers in their own habitat.
With a plot straight out of the ’80s, this teen angst 
movie characterizes our generation as a sad parrot of 
old popular culture and is very similar to some 
French movies. It also stars Ethan Hawke and Ben 
Stiller and has a funky ass soundrack that’ll get your 
booty moving, as it were. Two thumbs up.

Flintstones

produced, badly animated feature film directed by 
Steven Speilberg (or Speilrock). Starring Rick 
Moranis and John Goodman, this film is all about 
Barney Rubble and Fred Flinstone and all then- 
wacky adventures. And when I say adventures, I 
mean adventures. Big adventures.
Things happen, like Fred’s mother-in-law showing 
up. And Fred driving a car with his feet. We’re 
talking fun. I’m sure you’ll have a nice time if you see 
it, and I’m sure you’ll enjoy it. However, just consider

movie unless you and your par amour are into S&M.

Evil Dead
Consider the title, then ask yourself what this 
movie is about. It’s about evil dead. It was directed 
by Sam Raimi and is about evil dead demons taking 
¡over people’s bodies and then having them hack up 
other people. No plot twists, no love interests, just 
evil dead.
A modern horror classic, Evil Dead is the epitome 
of low budget slasher films. Though you won’t find 
'high drama, you’ll find plenty of blood and guts, and 
just a taste of delicious comedy. However, it’s not a 
good date movie unless you and your par amour are 
into S&M.

'F.nS« 0ntnS V" Cm­.tFoS 11T a compilation from moonshine 
music, shows the dynamic changes of electronic music within 
the past few years. Electronic music has reached beyond the 
dance-oriented music of techno and house, music. Unfortu­
nately, this particular collection of “ambient" electronic music 
belongs in a record store, not in anyone’s personal CD player.
Despite a few good tracks, the overall tone of the album 
actually put me to sleep. In fact, it was difficult to find the 
enjoyable songs because I was normally asleep after the first 
track.
Although ambient music strives to create a distinctive atmo­
sphere, the album lacked the intensity of techno or house music. 
Unfortunately, a listener dreadfully longs for that intensity 
because of the utter ennui that most of the album creates. After 
a song begins an initial progression is introduced yet, never 
abandoned. Monotony overwhelms the listener and suggests 
the much more entertaining world of sleep as an escape route.
Yet, there are a few good tracks on the album. To be more 
precise, 3 tracks actually engage the listener and open a path­
way to another world within the mind.
The second song, ‘•My Friend" by One Dove, follows the 
creative ingenuity that has made One Dove a dance hall favor­
ite. The use of Asian-like sounds combined with a gentle flowing 
and occasionally intertwined with semi-transcendental vocals. 
The experimental sound keeps the track from slipping into the 
same monotonous rythm that plagues most of the album.
Similarly, the fourth song on the album. “Salt Talk” by 
Sargasso Sea creates a vivid image of a relaxing visit to the sea.
. Furthermore, the surprising samples of seagulls actually takes 
the listener to the sea. Additionally, the sixth track, “Attached" 
by Orbital, highlights the very best of ambient electronic music. 
The drum machines provide a rich and very danceable beat with 
several changes and overdubs. Synthesizers gently build and 
then vary a fluid groove. Orbital somehow manages to show 
what ambient music can be and how it should be done.
Overall, 'F.nS« 0ntnS V" Cm­.SFoS 11 seems to highlight the 
boring aspects of electronic music. If you feel compelled to 
sample good electronic music, buy the Orbital CD or the One 
Dove CD. Don’t even bother to waste your time with this CD. If 
you want relaxing music to sleep by, try something in the 
classical section; at least then you won't be bored to sleep but 
relaxed into dreams.

(as in s2S lStrn V" 7Poot I’tnr Vi 
s2Sm°8W This usually results in 
growing to monstrous propor­
tions. It could also, however, re­
sult in just plain anti-social be­
havior.
Second, a human or animal 
could be exposed to toxic wastes 
(as in sVH.o CySFeSi or sSSFteS 
YPntFn f.F[t sPin’Sr8W Oddly 
enough, this seems to instill in 
the affected a desire to pursue 
truth, justice, and the American 
way.
Third, the mutation could be 
caused by a gentic experiment 
gone awry. This is the case in 
/.it2Ft 11D s2S 04tpF.FeW This 
usually leads to lots and lots of 
carnage.
Then, there are those who be­
come mutants through other sci­
entific mishaps, as in s2S I’B and 
l’VV«IiSt9W This means carnage, 
as well, but good things happen 
unintentionally.
Last but certainly not least, we 
have those who are mutants for 
no apparent reason, as in 
04VV9.SrW
Now that we understand what 
can cause mutations, and what 
can happen, let’s look at some 
textbook examples:
Atomic Blast Mutants
The best example in this cat­
egory is s2S lStrn V" 7Poot I’tnrW 
Tor Johnson (/’tF f.FS "iVm 
APnSi 04toS8 is caught in an
atomic blast and transformed into 
the hideous Beast of Yucca Flats 
(it basically looks like Tor Johnson 
with severe bums on his head). 
His mutation-influenced actions 
include murder and kidnapping.
The best thing about this film 
is that there is no real dialogue in 
it: all of the interactions between 
characters were either narrated 
(“Jim decides to parachute in”) or 
added in post-production (When­
ever someone speaks, their mouth 
is conveniently hidden or they 
themselves are off-camera). It 
makes for a really surrealistic 
film.
Genetic Experiments 
Gone Awry
The most shocking thing about 
/.it2Ft 11 isn’t the story, but the 
story behind it, in a manner of 
speaking. It was directed by 
James Cameron (sSim.FtnVi), 
and it stars Lance Henriksen 
ZC’.SFr8W I was really surprised 
that either of them were con­
nected with this film, but I guess
lStrn V" 7Poot I’tnr

you have to start somewhere.
The plot: It seems that some 
brilliant Military Think Tank 
Geneticist thought that pirahna 
would make a good weapon.
So, they tamper with their 
genes, and manage to create 
pirahna that have developed 
lungs and can fly through the air. 
Your tax dollars at work!
I had heard that the original 
/.it2Ft film had been made as a 
parody of OtprW
If this is the case, then /.it2Ft 
11 truly succeeds. It’s absolutely 
hysterical to see fish jump out of 
the water and go right for the 
jugular.
Basically, the movie is full of 
lots of really funny scenes of 
pirahna breaking windows, tak­
ing down tourists, and killing 
divers. The climactic beach scence 
is an absolute bad film classic.
Scientific, Not Genetic
Next up is l’VV« IiSt9T which 
features a mutant — well, we’ll 
get to that in a mutant ... err, 
minute. Sorry about that.
This movie really reminded me 
of /’tF f.FS "iVm APnSi 04toS, 
because of the smoking Criswell- 
ish narrator who pops up from 
time to time to share with us his 
commentary. Sometimes, he even 
says something that relates to 
the movie.
It’s the story of a Vietnam vet, 
biker, and Elvis look-a-like named 
Herschel (unfortunately, they 
don’t play up the fact that he 
looks like Elvis, but he does, es­
pecially in sunglasses). Hershcel 
is back from the war because he 
was severly burned on both arms. 
As a result, he’s taking a lot of 
pain-killers. Herschel soon gets 
into a bad crowd of recreational 
drugusers and becomes addicted.
Herschel gets a job working at 
the local turkey farm, and this is 
when the movie really gets good: 
because working at the farm are 
two mysterious white lab-coated 
scientists. They work in a small 
laboratory (about half the size of 
a standard double-occupancy 
dorm room) that consists of a desk, 
two chairs, and some chemistry 
gear. They make a deal with 
Herschel: they’ll pay him extra 
cash if he eats the turkey that 
they’re treating with this secret 
formula, to insure that it still 
tastes okay.
Well, we can see what’s going 
to happen before anyone else can. 
Herschel eats the turkey and 
passes out. When he wakes up, 
it’s evening. He goes home to his 
girlfriend, who is horrified to 
learn that Herschel is now — t 
nPi9SBR2St«S« mPntFn°
Herschel, however, is still a 
junkie. So, he goes out at night, 
finds some fellow junkies, strings 
them up by their feet, cuts their 
throats, and drinks their blood to 
get a fix!
There are lots of good scenes of 
the turkey-headed Herschel cup­
ping his hands to his beak to 
drink their blood.
The most irritating thing is that 
they used ONE scream for all of 
the victims; they just loop it over 
and over a few times. Sometimes 
it fits with where the actress was 
screaming, sometimes it doesn’t. 
But hey, that’s life (or death, in 
this case).
My advice to you is to stop the 
tape BEFORE the ending. Stop 
the tape after Herschel collapses 
in the field (after defeeting the 
drug lord — no, that’s not a typo, 
that’s a pun).
Just Plain Mutants!
I don’t know what I like more 
about 04VV9.SrD the stupid 
plotline or the title. The plot, in a 
nutshell: a group of friends de­
cides to go up to this abandoned 
house to have a party (how origi­
nal). Of course, they didn’t count 
on the Spookies!
The Spookies are a varied bunch 
of mutants, from weird lizard 
creatures to a giant black widow 
spiderwoman and a hook-handed 
monkey-type.
This movie is a typical formula 
horror movie: the old house, a 
ouija board, skeletons in the closet 
(literally), mysterious disappear­
ances: the list goes on. In fact, it’s 
really almost just a movie made 
from pieces of other, much better 
films (the possession scene re­
minded me of John Carpenter’s 
/i.FoS V" cti9FSrr8W The best part 
of this movie is the fun you can 
have at its expense: for example, 
when the kid sees the package 
toward the beginning of the film, 
yell out “It’s a human head!” (es­
pecially if there are others watch­
ing it with you).
I have really not even skimmed 
the surface of the proverbial gene 
pool with this column; there are 
so many possible avenues to ex­
plore! But, I hope that you have 
learned a little bit about mutants 
and why we love them so.
Next Week: The movies that 
even I can’t watch in their en­
tirety!
lStrn V" 7Poot I’tnrD 2 bombs 
— Nice hair, Tor.
/.it2Ft 11D 2 bombs — What 
would you use to catch a flying 
pirahna, a rod and reel or a lasso?
l’VV« IiSt9D 1 bomb — Gives 
new meaning to “You are what 
you eat.”
04VV9.SrD 3 bombs — The best 
part is that the annoying charac­
ters die, too.
