Wednesday, February 12, the Car­
negie basketball team dropped their 
sccond game to Washington and Jef­
ferson 36-24. The final score proved 
to be a surprise to the Plaid sup­
porters for the Presidents had a 
hard time nosing out the Tartans in 
the contest at Little Washington in 
which W. & J. had the services of 
Stew Wilson, star center. The men­
tal strain connected with examina­
tions as well as the week off dur­
ing this period no doubt played an 
important part in the defeat.
The visitors started with a rush, 
piling up a lead of nine points be­
fore the Carnegie quintet could find 
the basket. At this stage of the 
game the Tartans started their usual 
comeback and were successful in do­
ing better than holding the visitors 
even for the remainder of the first 
half which ended with W. & J.
leading 16-11. The Presidents con­
tinued their fast pace during the scc­
ond half and were in possession of 
the lead at all times. Hamilton of 
Washington and Jefferson was high 
point scorer of the evening while 
Webster was high man for the Tar­
tans. Dutch Eyth played an excel­
lent passing game during the, entire
contest, but was unfortunate in his
attempts to score.

English Actor Will 
Speak Tonight For 
Y.M. And W.H.A.
Carnegie Tech students, espe­
cially those interested in dramatics, 
will find much enjoyment in the 
program of “Dramatic Interludes” 
this evening when the Y. M. and 
W. H. A. presents V. L. Granville, 
distinguished English actor, as the 
eighth speaker of this season’s 
lecture series. The lecture will be 
given in the Morris Kaufmann Me­
morial Auditorium, 115 South Belle- 
field avenue.
Appearing in costume and make­
up, the noted British dramatist will 
give a presentation of the prin­
cipal characters from the drama 
of all time. In the short space of 
one evening Granville will present 
a cross-section of the universal 
theater from the very beginning of 
dramatic art to our own time.
Drawing upon his capacities as 
soldier, saint, hero and villain, 
Granville passes from one great 
character to the next with the ease 
and dexterity of practised per­
former.
Opening with selections from 
Sophocles and Plautus, Granville 
will offer vivid impersonations of 
Faustus from Marlowe’s, “The 
Tragical History of Dr. Faustus,” 
and of Richard III, and Falstaff 
from Shakespeare. Then passing to 
the realm of the more modern 
playwrights, he will portray the 
memorable role of Mrs. Malaprop 
from Sheridan's play, “The Rivals;” 
Fedya from Tolstoi’s; “The Living 
Corpse;” selections from Francois 
Villon, the great French poet; 
Cyrano de Bergerac from the pen 
of Rostand, and finally Svcngali 
from George du Maurier’s "Trilby.” 
Each of these characters the lec­
turer will realistically present in 
their own particular setting.
Tickets for the Granville per­
formance, as well as for the lec­
tures of Claude G. Bowers and 
Tom Sheyhill, to follow, may be 
secured at the information desk in 
the lobby of the Y. M. and W. H. 
A. ‘ on Bellefield avenue.

Mining=Technology 
Offers Fellowships
The Michigan College of Mining 
and Technology is offering for the 
academic year of 1930-1931 twelve 
graduate fellowships carrying sti­
pends of $1,200 each. Holders of 
these fellowships will be engaged 
in the study of various problems 
in connection with the general re­
search program of the college for 
which the State of- Michigan has 
provided the sum of $50,000 for 
the ciming year. This program 
deals with the iron and copper 
resources of Northern Michigan 
and with their utilization. Appro­
priate parts of this research pro­
gram arc conducted in co-operation 
with mining companies, the'U. S. 
Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the 
Carnegie Institute Department of 
Terrestrial Magnetism.
Each fellowship will carry full 
exemption from all fees except the 
regular matriculation and diploma 
fees. The fellowships are open to 
college graduates who have a 
Bachelor of Science degree or its 
equivalent and who arc qualified to 
undertake research in chemistry, 
geology, geophysics, electrical en­
gineering, metallurgy, mining or ore 
dressing.
Fellows will register as graduate 
students at the Michigan College 
of Mining and Technology and will 
become candidates for the degree 
of Master of Science. Their studies 
will be directed by the head of the 
department in which they are ma­
joring, but the greater portion of 
their time will be devoted to re­

Scarlet Mask Orchestra From 
Ohio State is Attrac­

NO CORSAGES WORN
Frat. Banners Decorate Two 
Sumptous Ball­
rooms
The annual Interfraternity For­
mal, probably the most brilliant so­
cial event of the year, will be held 
this Friday night ¡11 the ballroom of the Schenley Hotel.
Because of its proximity to all of 
the Carnegie fraternity houses and 
splendor of its ballroom, the Schen- 
ley Hotel is undoubtedly well suit­
ed to the occasion. The decora­
tions of the magnificent ballroom 
can hardly be improved upon, but 
the lavish display of the fraternity 
banners and colors should lend an 
appropriate atmosphere to the dance.
The “Scarlet Mask” orchestra, 
one of the finest college groups of 
artists in the* United States, will 
excursion from Ohio State Uni­
versity especially, for the event, led 
by Dick Wolf, a very versatile 
musician with a reputation of be­
ing able to play any instrument in 
the world, this brilliant group of 
syncopators will honor tliQ occasion 
with its presence and assure the 
Forn1!al's success. Dick Wolf has 
been for tjir'ec years the leader of 
his orchestra, which has frequently 
played at the well-known Castl6 
Farms pf Cincinnati, Ohio.
Dancing will begin at 10 p. rn. 
and will continue until 2 a. in., 
while the refreshments will be ten­
dered from 11 o’clock to "2 o'clock', 
The orchestra will play continuousr 
ly for those who wish to dance 
while the refreshments are being served.
Following the custom initiated 
last year the Formal committee 
has announced that no corsages 
will be worn by I lie girls, SiucOi 
this was met .with approval last 
year, a llowerless formal is consid­
ered a prudent innovation.
Anticipating a record attendance 
of over -100 because of the promi­
nence of the "Scarlet Mask" or­
chestra and the significance of the 
affair, both ballrooms on the main 
iloor of the Schenley Hotel arc in

New Cement And 
Concrete Lab Now 
Complete For Use
The recent completion of the 
Cement and Concrete Testing Lab­
oratory, which is now ready for 
use during the second semester, 
marks the culmination of a scries 
of improvements in Engineering 
Hall. This Laboratory, a sub-divi­
sion of the Material Lab., is un­
der the direction of Professor-Mc­
Cullough and will be used for. the 
express- purpose of curing and test­
ing ' samples of cement and con­
crete. Its contsruction was made 
entirely by the Institute and was 
begun several months ago.
Because of the contemplated 
erection of the wind tunnel in the 
old Materials Laboratory in Ma­
chinery Hall, the basement of En­
gineering Hall was selected as the 
new location for the Materials • Lab 
which was constructed during -the 
previous summer and used through­
out the first semester as a course 
of study for the Sophomore Civil 
Engineers. The Lab is equipped 
with a variety of machines' and 
apparatus for testing the physical 
properties of all kinds of build­
ing materials such as cast iron, 
steel, stone, cement, brick, and 
timber. These are determined by 
tension, compression, torsion, hard­
ness, impact, and abrasion tests.
For a laboratory of its kind, it 
is very thoroughly equipped with 
extensometers, deflectometers, com- 
pi essometers. Tyler sieves, and 
recording thermometers so that 
both high and lo(v temperature 
tests may be accurately performed.
A short laboratory course in the 
design and control of concrete 
mixtures will be offered the latter, 
part of this month by the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology to archi­
tects, engineers and contractors. 
The course will be conducted by 
Frof. J. M. Daniels of the depart­
ment of civil engineering.
The course will include and sup­
plement the material presented in

Grand Central Palace, New York 
Motion pictures of the football 
team, taken during the past season.,

Bccausc plans for the March 20 
meeting have already been made, 
no meeting is being planned for 
March 1, in co-operation with the 
Pittsburgh Varsity Clan meeting 
being held in Pittsburgh on that 
date. The Clan, however, heartily 
indorses the idea of having an 
"Across the Continent Clan Day.” 
Washington Clan
W. D. Hall, who is now located 
in Washington with the United 
Typothetae of America, writes’that 
he and several other Tech gradu­
ates l<?cated with the Typothetae 
are interested in getting the Car­
negie Tech people in Washington 
re-organized. Will anyone inter­
ested in a clan organization in 
Washington get in touch with Mr. 
Hall at Fourteenth and K streets, 
—orthwest? There are quite a 
number of alumni located in this 
city, surely enough to have a fine 
clan organized, but nothing has 
been done for a year or more and 
we should like to hear from the 
Washington Clan once again.

Bickley may be remembered as 
the. man, who invented the moving 
electric light sign board which 
spells words that travel across the 
sign. For a number of years he 
built houses both in the east and 
on the west coast, but he says 
that the bottom has dropped out 
of the house market. Therefore, 
he went back to his old love, 
mccbanical engineering, and design­
ed a machine for sorting beans, 
lie was in Pittsburgh in connec­
tion with the sale of these ma­
chines to The Heinz Food Prod­
ucts Company. Bicklcy’s machine 
sorts beans by color and also picks 
out the stones. The machine sorts 
two beans per second, whereas the 
fastest working girl has only been 
able to sort one bean every two 
seconds. Furthermore, the machine 
,tnalcfes. no mistakes, whereas a girl 
will, make a grab for a stone and 
pick out, a bean instead. As some 
wag said, "bean sorter nice t,o

On Horseshoe Lake near Oklahoma City, In 
a businesslike, compact building, 8 7,000 horses 
(figuratively speaking) arc stabled . nearly 
three for every family in Oklahoma Gity. For 
with the completion of a new unit of the Okla­
homa Gas & Electric Company’s power sta­
tion at this point, the total generating capacity 
was raised from 46,930 to 87,130 horsepower.
To keep these “horses” up to full working 
condition, and do it cheaply as possible, is no 
small job. Just the water required is 86,400,- 
000 gallons daily, the equivalent of eight days’ 
supply for Oklahoma City.
The new generating unit was made necessary 
by the expansion of industrial activity through­
out Oklahoma and particularly by the in­
creased use of electric power by the oil industry'. 
For it, improved valves, fittings, and piping, 
so vital to efficient and economical power 
production, were supplied by Crane Co. Thus 
in these modern times does progress in one 
industry bring progress in another. ‘
No matter what branch of engineering you 
enter after graduation, you are likely to find 
Crane piping materials essential tools of your 
profession. In the Crane book, “Pioneering in 
Science,” is told the story of Crane research in 
metallurgy, with important scicntific data and high 
pressure and temperature curves. A copy will 
be valuable for reference. Let us send you one.

A SECTION OF THE TARTAN 
DEVOTED TO THE 
NIGHT STUDENTS
PRESIDENTDIDJA NOTICETenacity
Tenacity is inborn in man anti 
reveals itself in his life for good or 
evil indifferently. The conservatism 
of man, the clinging to' the cust6tns 
of the past, and the hugging of 
possessions is one aspect of this 
characteristic. But hcroic men do not 
exhibit tenacity in this narrow* fash­
ion, rather they hold wealth and 
power and life itself as pawns to 
be freely risked in a play of grand 
proportions.
The will to live, the- tenacious 
clinging to life is the first require­
ment for man's continued .existence; 
The universe presents to ma*- a face 
whose aspect is inscrutable and in­
different at best and terribly un­
friendly at worst. Yet by persistent 
cfTort man has strengthened His hold 
upon life and pushed back the un­
friendly elements of nature. Even 
now man peers ihto a future in 
which his intelligence will have sub­
jected the brute forces about him 
and made his mind master over all 
other forms of matter.
In man this, will to live rises far 
above the tenacious clinging to ex­
istence which all orders of life dis­
play. It is more than mere shrink­
ing from death. It reveals itself 
rather as a hcroic and stoical cour­
age which can .never be defeated. 
It results not from a reasoning pro­
cess but it is a part of man’s life 
dower which is in his blood and 
will never permit him to be cowed. 
No matter how severe the blow of 
fate which may fell a man, this 
impulse remains within him. The 
joy and zest of life may depart 
from him and his existence . become 
a futility which inevitably terminates 
in death, yet if this inner force can 
be stirred by any means the man 
will rise to his feet and continue 
the struggle almost' as though lie 
had never been struck down.
We may sec on all sides of us 
men who struggle under immense 
economic and physical handicap:?, yet 
who will not succumb to the buf­
feting of fate. Great numbers of 
such men go down to destruction slill 
struggling with their destiny. We 
call them failures and say they arc 
defeated. But. such men arc more 
hcroic in their defeat than most suc­
cessful men are ii| victory. No man 
who exerts his will to the end is 
defeated.
This resolute , front) .g IN life is 
finely expressed by Mathew Arnold 
in a few of his verses.

With the advent of the new semes­
ter the Plaid wishes to make the 
following announcement.
All night students who, when regis­
tering, pay the student activities fee, 
are entitled to receive the Tartan, 
free through the mail. This Carnegie 
Weekly contains the Plaid news on 
page three. This is the section of the 
Tartan devoted to the night students:
The Plaid, hopes that all night stu­
dents who are entitled to receive 
this publication through the mail arc 
receiving it. If there arc' any' night 
students not getting the paper, they 
are requested to send their names to 
the Plaid, room 12 Industries Build­
ing, Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
stating this fact, and an investigation 
will be made to ascertain why the 
paper is not delivered. With the 
large enrollment, and the consequent 
large mailing list, it will be readily 
seen that an oversight will occur, 
and the only way we have of ascer­
taining this fact is for the night 
students to acquaint us of the cir­
cumstances.
All students attending night school,' 
however, arc not entitled to receive 
the paper throught the mail, unless 
they subscribe for it. In this class 
attention is callcd to the “Faculty 
Privilege students” and those graduate 
Degree Students, who pay no activi­
ties fee. If in doubt as to whether 
or not you arc entitled tq, get . the 
Tartan through the mail, consult your 
registration card, and see if you are 
credited with the Activities Fee..
Night Electrical SmokerEverything is in readiness for the 
doors to open upon the most elab­
orate dance of the Night Students* 
social calendar this Saturday eve­
ning. The Washington’s Birthday 
dance of the Night Student Coun­
cil will be held at that time in the 
auditorium of the Men’s Gymnasi­
um and from the advance sale of 
tickets it looks like a capacity 
crowd will be present.
If you by chance have forgotten, 
it is not too late we hope, to date 
up the one and only for this glor­
ious affair. Better give her a call 
now and set your mind to rest, for 
if you miss this dance you will 
never forgive yourself for your lack 
of interest in the social activities 
of your school.
The Venetian Scrcnadcrs have 
been obtained for this dance and 
this band of musicians ccrtainly 
know their harmony. This orches­
tra has never played on the Cam­
pus before, but on several occasions 
they have provided the music at 
fraternity and other social func­
tions for Carnegie as well as for 
Pitt. Those who have heard them 
speak highly of their ability.
Of course, the dance would not 
be complete without the minuet. 
This attraction will be staged with 
appropriate background and music 
by four couplcs who are night 
students. The danccrs will be in 
costumes in keeping with the occa­
sion. This feature has become a 
tradition with the Washington’s 
Birthday Dance and this year it 
promises to be more attractive 
than ever before.
The. committee,. under the direc­
tion of William Hoddcr and Ed­
ward McDonald, have been work­
ing continuously for the past week 
preparing decorations and other 
unique features to. make this the 
most succcssful dance ever spon­
sored by the' Night Student Coun­
cil. Everything will be prepared” 
and ready. The only other .re­
quirement for your complete enjoy­
ment of the evening will be your 
presence. Get your ticket from 
one of the salesmen or pay . at the 
do,or, but in any event be there 
and. we guarantee you that Febru­
ary 22’ 1930, will be an. evening 
that you will not forget for some 
time to conic.
The Seventh Annual Smoker of 
the Electrical Equipment and Con­
struction Department of the Col­
lege of Industries will be held Fri­
day evening, February 21, in the 
Union.
The committee under the direc­
tion of Mr. F. C. Ashe, has been 
working for the past month arrang­
ing for the affair. On the pro­
gram is scheduled a timely talk 
by Mr. Alexander of the Transmis­
sion Department of the Bell Tele-; 
phone Co. His subject will be 
"Television.” Mr. Pfouts will be 
there also to tell us a few stories, 
and wc hope he will include his 
now famous “Dog” story. Use-, 
ful favors are included as well as 
smokes and eats. And these are 
well worth the' price of admission.
The smokers have always been 
a succcss and they need no intro­
duction to the older electrical stu­
dents. The first year men should 
follow the example o„f the older 
students and turn out for this ar- 
fair. Classes in the Electrical De­
partments will be cxcuscd early to 
enable all to attend.
Remember—the time is February 
21, at S:30 p. m. The place is the 
Union. The price of admission is 
75 cents, with a chance to win a 
fin$ door prize.
Strange there were others who 
.also noticed the lack of towels in 
the wash rooms as could be seen 
in the last issue of the Plaid. They 
say that this is a coincidence, but I 
say it is a reality. I was greatly 
surprised to notice that there was 
an abundance of towels during the 
past week, which all goes to’ show 
that if you don’t see something, 
the best plan is to ask for it; 
maybe you will get it, and maybe 
you won't. We got it, and thanks.
Speaking of getting what you ask 
for. I-would like to know what be­
came of that interesting column 
.“What the Night Arts are Read­
ings” I hope the’ writer has not 
desist'ecj 'for good, because I really 
did find time to read this column 
at the expense of losing my name 
and reputation , for idleness. I 
know -there arc others, too, who 
enjoyed them, so let’s have more 
of them.
I ran.bled into the newly modern­
ized room in Industries- where the 
students- can sit down for qurct 
study and relaxation during the 
periods between classes. While 
there, I noticed a little sign calling 
the students’ attention to the fact 
‘'at' the periodicals were to be re­
turned to the racks when they were 
through, with them. I also noticcd 
'that they were furnished smoking 
stands; think of it, smoking stands 
for their comfort, and they were 
requested to make use of them. 
It does- seem to me that it should 
hardly bc‘ necessary to call the at­
tention of the students to these 
little courtesies due for favors re­
ceived, but one glance after 10:30 
p. m, convinced me that some peo­

Found time to attend the Night

have a good time, well you can 
just bet I did. This makes me 
want to be present at the next af­
fair. Speaking of the next affair 
brings me to the Washington’s 
Birthday dance which is scheduled 
for February 22. Strange this 
.should fall on the same day as 
Washington’s Birthday. 'Wonder- 
why this is? Maybe there is a holi­

MOKING a pipe is like flying 
an airplane—you really ought 
to know how, if you’re hoping to 
enjoy it much.
Pipe technique can be pickcd up ' through experience, or it can be 
learned outright. Master it now, 
to relish your pipes! " ”
Rule One for Pipc-smoldng is 
' "Find your tobacco.”
Rule One stops some beginners. 
They look here. They search. ;f

Rule Two is .. but \yould you

For the benefit of the new students 
who have registered this year, the 
Plaid takes pleasure in presenting 
Mr. James H. Sansonctti, President 
of the Night Student Council.
MrN Sansonctti is registered in the 
College of Fine Arts, and is a stu­
dent in the Department of Architec­
ture. He is an ^-relent student, and 
always willing to lend a helping hand 
wherever he can. He has spent sev­
eral yfcars on the Campus at night 
and knows TER-- what a night student 
has to put up with.
As the President of the Night 
Student Council lie is anxious to 
serve the night students, and will 
wclcomc any suggestions for the bet­
terment of our causc.' ct the long contention cease!

Young Man of Manhattan (?) by 
Katherine Brush is more to ny

A Farewell to Arms (Scribner’s) 
by Ernest Hemingway is written 
in his best style, which is saying 
plenty! It’s about the war, but 
how! Totally absorbing and powerful­
ly written.
YVhitcoaks:. of Jalna -.(Little,

This may be good, but, “I ain’t 
saying.” Read it for yourself, I 
may have overlooked the inner 
significance but be that as it may, 
I found it uninteresting.
Scoop (Littic, Brown) is by J.

a newspaper story that really scams 
real, having a sincerity these books 
usually! just attempt. Recommended.

That Night Arts dance held on 
the eighth turned out to be one 
grand succcss. Believe you me,, 
all that was said about how good 
it was to be came true and then 
some. The Red Pepper orchestra 
ccrtainly lived up to its name. I 
doubt whether wc have ever 
had a better orchestra at any of 
our dances. When that gang play­
ed "Crying for the Carolinas” 
your feet j.ust couldn’t keep still. 
And the refreshments I Were 
they good! Ask some one.
Of course, the Council will mod­
estly admit their dances arc all 
as good as this one was. Maybe 
it was the soft lights, or that toc- 
tickli’ng music, or those hit-thc-spot 
refreshments — whatever it was, 
there was that indefinable some­
thing that seemed to set this dance 
apart. And, let me tell you, it led 
this dance dear to the top of the 
list, for it was the most glorious 
affair ever sponsored by the Night 
Arts. The officers of the Night 
Arts arc to be congratulated, for 
it is through their untiring efforts 
and the co-operation of the student 
body that our danCcs arc such suc­
cessful affairs.

The recent play, “The Three

was said to be very entertain­

only a few of the night students 
had the opportunity of viewing any 
of the performances. Tickcts seemed 
to be all exhausted when applica­
tion was made fcr them. It seems 
th-.t tickcts for the various functions

Perhaps, someday a sclicmc will be

NEW TRAFFIC SIGNALWilP lot thn Ediowortti oomof V 1Night architccts have just com­
pleted another chcrrcttc, and what 
a mad time it was. They had less 
time for this problem' than pre­
viously, and consequently every 
night student had to do double 
time in order to have the problem 
fully rendered at the sound of the 
gong at zero hour.
An early perusal of the different 
solutions of the problem indicated 
that the work was up to previous 
efforts of this group of students, 
and they should come through with 
their customary number of success­
ful grades.
Y.’c arc told at last that a Traffic 
Signal will be installed at the junc­
tion of Morcwood avenue and Forbes 
street. This should be good news to 
all those students who use this
entrance to the school. Now wc will 
be given an even break to get" across 
the street. It is a wonder that there 
has not been a serious accidcnt at
this point befor" now. Wc hope
that this addition will shortly be
placcd in operation.
A plan which calls for a scries 
of weekly visits to different frater­
nity houses by faculty members 
for the purpose of coming in con­
tact with undergraduates has been 
approved by a large number of 
fraternit’es at the .University of 
Michigan.

Thanks For The Towels
It is a pleasure to note that the 
pica for more paper towels during 
the nigh: sessions has been answered, 
and that there appear? to be a sup­
ply on hand. We don’t know who. 
is responsible, this is not important, 
but wc are glad that we have them, 
and this is important.
A littl • caution Would, however, not 
be out of place, an-’ that .is let every 
one try to use the towels within rea­
son. They are there for a purpose, 
and that is to dry your hands.

Frontiers of telephony 
old and new
Yesterday the natural course of tele­
phone expansion was to penetrate the 
nation’s frontiers, building new lines and 
adding new subscribers.
Today finds many new “frontiers” for 
telephone expansion — among them the 
homes of present subscribers. Upstairs 
and downstairs,wherever needed,additional
telephones are being installed. People are 
learning that there is added utility in 
convenient communication.
This new field of activity was conceived 
by commercial development men of the 
Bell System. Just.another example of foi> 
ward planning to make telephone service 
more valuable.

Printing News
The Committee on Education, of 
the . United Typothetae of America, 
is sponsoring a movement to estab­
lish a "Typothetae Technical Li­
brary” at the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology. The members of the 
Committee have already donated 
sufficient funds to purchase a num­
ber of important books on print­
ing which are to serve as the nu­
cleus for the permanent collection.
The Department of Printing is 
preparing two circulars which arc 
to be used in connection with 
“Father and Son Week,” which is 
being promoted by the United 
Typothetae of America. These 
pamphlets, which are to be dis­
tributed at printers’ meetings and 
in public schools during the week 
beginning February 17, have been 
.vrittch by G. Frederick Kalkhoff 
and Professor. Gustafson, and are 
entitled respectively, "Printers, 
Yesterday and Today” and "The 
Importahce of the Printing' In­
dustry in the United States.” These 
pamphlets were printed by the 
class in Printing Production.
The Department of Printing lias 
completed the printing of a hand­
some booklet by W. Arthur Cole, 
fermer Honorary president of the 
American • Institute of Graphic 
Arts, on the "Influence of Fine 
Printing.” Three hundred copies' 
of this publication are being dis­
tributed to friends of the Depart­
ment of Printing and of the Lab­
oratory Press, which collaborated 
with the Department in the plan­
ning of the' typography of this 
booklet.
The annual Father and Son 
Week promoted by the United 
Typothetae of America will be 
held in printing centers of the 
United States and Canada this 
week. Its purpose is" to interest 
the sons of master printers in 
their father’s business, and to en­
courage them to seek the very 
best possible training for the fu­
ture . management of those busi­
nesses.
Attractive Paintings Now 
Decorate t(Y,y Club Room
Two attractive paintings, one a 
large picture representing a scene 
in Naples and the other a smaller 
one depicting a scene in Rome, 
have recently been added to the 
Y. M. 1 C. A. room in Industries 
Building. Given to the “Y" by 
Professor Wurts, former head of 
the Electrical Engineering Depart 
ment and present chairman of the 
Welfare Committee, these two pic­
torial decorations are to be fol­
lowed by other improvements in 
the appearance of the room. A 
10-foot table, to be designed by 
Professor Ashe of the Art School 
and to be built by the Carpentry 
Shop, will be added along with a 
magazine rack, curtains, and a rug. 
A daily newspaper is to be placed 
at the disposal of the students.
Rejuvenated Skibo 
Makes Campus Debut
Skibo has undergone its Renais­
sance, a period of transformation 
and rejuvenation in which all the 
undesirable features of the erst­
while "dive” have been covered up 
or removed from the scene of ac­
tion. As the proprietress, Mrs. Gil­
bert, proudly announced, ' the place 
looks different to everyone and the 
first few days the customers en­
tered with open-eyed wonder at the 
strange sight. No more were the 
grcasjr-topped tables, the general 
atmosphere of male disorder; no 
more the litter of ancient cigarct 
butts, O’Hcnry Avrappers and apple 
seeds that lurked in every corner. 
In its place the astonished cus­
tomers viewed a model shop, clean 
and shining, with brightl}r colored 
chintz curtains, "bought expressly 
to please the Dramat’s S3rnthctic 
sense of color.” A radio docs its 
bit in cheering up the blue Mon­
day morning and beside it is the 
oli! cash register, respondant in its 
new coat of gilt. On the top 
shelves, reminiscent of by-gone 
days, are rows of silver-tipped bot­
tles of varying sizes, containing 
nothing more intoxicating than 
White Rock or Canada Dry. The-
smiling “barmaid” is none other 
than Mrs. Gilbert, who aims to 
please and who has been doing 
considerable target practice pre­
vious to her advent to the campus; 
Three, meals; - a day arc dished out, 
the- food being placed on a new 
aluminum tray whose shiny sur­
face reflects one's image. Wc saw 
the kitchen where the menu origi­
nates and agreed with the delivery­
man’s enthusiastic approbation of 
the immaculate appearance.
The regular stock has been con­
tinued, with the addition of aspirin 
tablets and pocket combs to the 
list which already included such 
necessary items as handkerchiefs 
and shaving cream. The first day's 
receipts amounted to the grand 
total of $2;. to date the the total 
income from hungry Maggie 
Murphs is about $92 a day which 
portends big things for our campus 
ex-junk shop in the future. Wc 
couldn't, learn just what percentage 
of Carnegie’s population subsists 
on Skibo.s fare, but there have 
been no recent casualties noised 
about, so let’s give the new. Skibo 
a welcome hand and sample its 
wares.
Favors to Be Given Out
Fearful of the confusion that re­
sulted last year when favors -where 
attempted to be distributed while the 
Interfraternity Dance was at its 
height, the committee has decided 
this 3'ear "to present the favors at 
the door. Since the gifts, which arc 
indeed a feature of the event, have 
been sccurerd at a cost somewhat 
greater than in previous years from 
the IiooverrSmith Company, a nation­
ally ktlown jewelry concern of Phila-r 
dclphia, it is assurred. that the ladies 
will be highly pleased. In selecting 
the favors the committee has remem­
bered to choose such gratuities that 
would be appropriate but at the same 
time not bulky nor burdensome.

Air Points
The first airplane to be con­
structed with Carnegie students 
acting in the capacity of aero­
nautical engineers has been com­
pleted and flown at Franklin, Pa 
This plane, of the biplane type, 
but embodying new. principles of 
design, has been constructed by 
the Joy Manufacturing Company,' 
With five juniors from Carnegie 
making the stress analysis. These 
men, G. F. Langraf, M. J. Frank. 
J. H. Dodge, J. F. Sprigg and 
F. B. Stclcn, have been working: 
for several, months carrying this 
co-operative work during their 
spare time. -
The new plane, will be flown to 
Bettis Field soon for the official 
tryout. It represents the first at­
tempt of this company to enter 
the field of aviation as previously 
the company was concerned , with 
the manufacture of machinery for 
coal mining.*¦ * * *
The wind tunnel in the basement 
of Machinery Hall is rapidly near­
ing completion; the propeller and 
motor have been installed, nearly 
all the outside- woodwork finished 
and the inside veneer applied. This 
summer the wind tunnel will be 
operated' by several students who 
plan to make the necessary research 
for the succcssful operation of the 
tunnel.* * * *
Progress on the air glider being 
built by a group of students at

MUSIC NOTES
Opera,- in 'more than small tid-hits 
and trite arias of Toreador fame, 
came to the Theater of Fine Arts 
last Sunday evening in the person of 
Gounod's Faust. Anyone who mis­
sed hearing the worthy clTorts of the 
performers, missed a work that, de­
spite the lack of business' and cos­
tume, was full of fire at times, and 
hardly ever allowed the enthusiasm 
of the hearers to drop below that of 
the singers. An excerpt from such 
a work is apt to stale in rehearsal 
and remain stale f'r the performance, 
this under the hand of less than rn 
artist. But, register our surprise and 
peace of mind when wc heard the 
quartette rise above its rehearsals 
and show its true ability.
The piano concerto in A Minor, 
Op. 16, by Grieg was very ably 
handled by Catherine Keppcl with 
Sclmar Jansen at the second piano. 
Miss "cppcl bore the burden of the 
work and it set well upon her 
shoulders, or should wc say fingers. 
A brilliance that was brittle only 
once was hers. At all other times 
it was sparkling like many faceted 
stones against the black velvet drapery. 
Seldom have wc seen such grace at 
a piano, and wc don’t mean lofty 
elbow movement,, wc said grace, ably 
carricd out in the performance, 
thought, ' execution and grace, all 
synonomius. -The girl can handle herself. No
nifct in the “Y" Club room Satur­
day morning and discussed plans 
for reorganization of such a club, i * * * *

concerning the progress of aviation 
and the aeronautical engineering 
courses at Carnegie will be pub­

at the registrar’s office.
footlights will ever blind her, even 
momentarily. She puts one so much 
at case. She’s at case herself. Grieg 
is so lovely and warm even in his, 
sharp contrasts and Miss Keppcl can 
be congratulated on her reading, 
especially for the color and nuance 
in the second movement.
The Faust wa\ well done as we’ve 
said before. A metallic quality could 
be discerned at times, but thlit can 
be-forgivcn on the score of tin- 
tempered singers. The Frcrieh ,diction 
here and then was a hit moth eaten 
but it was a foreign language and 
therefore worthy of consideration not 
due one’s own tongue.
The singers knuv what they were- 
doing and-did it. An amazing amount 
of stage presence can be admired 
and we want to congratulate the 
quartette as a group upon the,master­
ful way they performed Sunday night. 
Marguerita (Miss Alberta J-rvinc): 
needs no comment as she improved 
even as the program continued. Lack 
of space forbids anymore comment 
than the above.
Just a word about the Pittsburgh 
S. mphony concert, Sunday night, 
Feb. 9, and the ensuing complimentary 
jouralistfc praises. For a musician, 
-i wever community-minded,; (patron­
ize your naborhood druggist and all 
that sort of thing) to blaspheme the 
orchestras of New York, Philadelphia, 
Boston and Chicago by breaking 
down and admitting that the Home 
Town Symphony did a program that 
would tax the ability of any one of 
these, is too far a cry from a trust­
ing, Vivid imagination to grim reality. 
Hreeskin is a violinist and does a 
nice job at the Penn. We wonder 
if . lie can be forgiven for dinning 
Respighi in our ears' again after 
Toscanini drew .the New York 
Philharmonic through it: here last year. 
Ernest Lunt had a Corner on our 
compliments, and why. not? He did 
two worthy numbers, worthily, name­
ly, Palmgrcn’s "Sorrow" and the 
“Hallelujah,” to Brccskin’s one, the 
“Prometheus” overture.

A shakedown test, a rescue, 
' and a hundred thrills
A
 SCORE of carefree Coast Guard 
sailors, and with them a Westing- 
house man from the Boston Office, 
headed in a “bum boat” for the cutter 
Chelan peacefully at anchor in the 
harbor of Hamilton, Bermuda Islands;
It had been an exciting shakedown 
test-cruise. The Westinghouse turbine 
generator, motor and condensers had 
functioned perfectly, the sea had yield­
ed up its bag of tricks, the Bermudas 
had fascinated every soul. And soon 
they would be bound for home.
But fate held new experiences in store. 
Five hundred miles off the Azores, the 
Newport,New York State training ship, 
had lost her propeller. The Chelan was 
called to the rescue. And with her, of 
course, went the Westinghouse man.

BACK AGAIN, after our little vacation, and with us we 
bring tidings of great joy. That basketball jinx that has been 
following our Tartans since the beginning of the season has 
been banished. The time, the place and the victims were: Last 
Saturday evening, the Carnegie Gymnasium, and the Nittany 
Lions of Penn State, in their respective order. The score was 
23-11, showing a decisive victory. Following those two losses 
to Thiel and W. & J., this win helps materially to boost Car­
negie’s chances for a more impressive closing of the current
3eason. - .The State game marked the return of Ralph Merten to his 
old center position. Ralph was decidedly “on,” being the high 
scorer of the evening, with three field goals and two fouls to 
his credit. Captain Nease and Jimmy Leonard continued to 
show that same brand of play which has marked them as stars 
in the preceding games. Now, if they and their teammates 
maintain their stride, things look more roSy for the coming 
games.The State game was the last appearance of the team on 
their home floor until February 25, when the stubborn Pitt out­
fit will journey over for the finale of that three-game series. The 
Tartans begin their road engagements tomorrow night when 
they meet Uncle Sam’s West Point Cadets in the Army gym. 
Then come the college of the City of New York and New York 
University on Friday and Saturday evenings. After the Pitt 
game on the twenty-fifth, the boys will wind up their season 
with the Geneva quintet, at home, on March 1. All this means 
that the season is nearly over—just three games away and two 
at home, and the ’29-’30 season will'be history.* * * *
WS WERE SOMEWHAT STARTLED the other day 
when we opened a local news sheet and perceived the following 
caption glaring out at us, “HARVARD TEAM WALLOPS
TECH.” Wondering when athletic relations had been opened
with those gentlemen of the broad’ “a,” we became interested. 
Upon investigation, we found that Harvard and Tech were 
merely two of the teams in the Sons of Italy Bowling League. 
And, if you’re still interested, Cornell gave West Virginia three 
"decisive beatings” and Pitt “slapped” W. & J. to “cop three.”* * * *
THE PLEBES CAME THROUGH with two more wins, 
one over Pitt Junior College of Johnstown, 32-16, and one over 
Bill Amos’ Wash-Jeff Freshmen, 36-15. Our boys showed their 
distinct superiority in both games, the work of Smith, Burns 
and Fergus being outstanding.° * * * *
BACK AGAIN TO FOOTBALL, with the announcement 
that the Annual Varsity Clan and Pittsburgh Clan Luncheon 
will be held on Saturday, March 1, at Mr. Eppley’s William 
Penn Hotel. The time is 1:00 p:_ m. The same evening, at 
7:00 p. m., Mr. Lanahan will give his party for the football men 
at the Pittsburgh Field Club. The luncheon is of special interest 
to all Carnegie-ites, as the football captain for 1930 will be 
named by • the coaches during the course of the affair. This 
method of selecting a leader has caused no little comment, its 
adoption by several of the major colleges being testimony as to 
its .Worth. It was by this method that Eddie Baker was se­
lected as the leader of Pitt’s 1930 team. If the hullabaloo raised 
most schools relative to fraternity politics, etc., under the sys­
tem of election by the players themselves, is any indication, the 
new idea might well be incorporated into the athletic govern­
ing pact of the schools^in question.
THE SWIMMERS HAVE COMMENCED their splashing 
«since we were with you last On last Wednesday, the Varsity aquators bowed to Pitt, 39-23. On Saturday, the Plebes lost 
81-8, to the University School of Cleveland. These meets do not form an impressive start for the swimming season, but before the next meet, Coach Risedroph will have had nearly a week of practice in which to remedy the faults of the first meets.

SCOTCHMEN BREAK
(Continued from Page One) 
ball until the visitors came down the 
floor to break it up. When this 
happened, one or to Skibos would 
cut for the basket and a two pointer 
usually' resulted.
Carnegie obtained an early lead 
when Merten dropped in a field goal. 
This one was followed by another 
two pointer by Leonard. Penn State 
tied the count a minute later, but 
this was the only field goal that 
the vi pi tors were able to obtain in 
the opening frame. On the other 
hand, the Carnegie team was at top 
form, ¿.¡voting, faking and passing 
with deadly accuracy they had but 
little difficulty in penetrating State's 
defense. The first half ended with 
the Tartans ahead 13o. The second 
half was a duplicate of the first, and 
during this period Carnegie scored 
three field goals to the visitor's two, 
while the fouls were evenly dis­
tributed.
The contest was by far the most 
interesting to watch of the entire 
season and too much credit cannot
be. given to the coach and the mem­
bers of the , squad. The diminutive 
Leonard again proved his worth as 
a dependable floor man, but to point 
out one individual star would not 
be fair to the others, for every man 
is an important cog’ in the machine. 
With the team at last in its winning 
stride, many supporters expect 'the 
Skibos to return from their Eastern 
invasion' with additional scalps.

Plebe Cagers Top Pitt Junior Quint 
In State Prelim
The Plebes scored an impressive 
win over the Pitt Junior college 
live of Johnstown Friday in the 
the preliminary to the Penn State 
game when they downed the visi­
tors '32-16. The Plebes got away 
to an early start and were in the 
lead for all but two minutes of the 
game.
In the first minute of play the Tar­
tans scored two field goals and John­
stown called time out. The Plebes 
added a foul to bring the score to 
5-0 but the Pitt boys found them­
selves and brought the score to 
5-4 by sinking two fouls and a 
field goal, From this point 'he 
teams battled on fairly even terms 
until the last five minutes of the 
half when the Plebes spurted to 
gain a decisive edge, the score at 
half time being 20-10. .
In the second half the Junior 
college lads came back with their 
men shifted to new positions. This 
old trick caused the Plebes to let 
Ditteio get loose for his third bas­
ket of the evening and a foul a 
minute latter brought the count to 
20-13 but this was as close as the 
visitors were able to come for the 
rest of the evening. The Plebes 
began to use the new slow break­
ing offense which the varsity also 
employed latter in the evening and 
soon broadened the gap between 
the teams and the final score being 
32-16.
Smith v held scoring honors for 
the evening sinking six field gdals. 
He also played a bang up floor 
•game and was the main cog in the 
Plebe combination. Not far be­
hind, however, were Fergus and 
Siegal whose spectacular guarding 
and all around play was responsible 
f r holding the visitors in check. 
Dittello was the bright light for 
the Johnstown lads and it was 
mainly thrqugh his individual ef­
forts that the Pitt team kept in the 
running during the early stages of 
the game. His dribbling and shoot­
ing were unusually fine and were 
responsible for more than half his 
teams points.

The Carnegie Plebes repeated 
their early season victory over the 
Wash.-Jeff. five, Tuesday, when they 
handed the Little Presidents the 
sfiiall end of 36-15 score. The 
Plebes got an early lead and Coach 
Bill Amos’ lads were unable to 
overtake them at any stage of the 
battle.
The game opened lather, slowly 
with both teams sounding out their 
opponents. The Plebes were first

before the Red and Black found 
themselves. Then for a brief spell
‘All About the Big Scotch Swimming Party,’ 
Free Admission to Everyone, Friday at 4:30
Freshman Sandy McTavish want­
ed to get a chance in the swim­
ming meet, for he had learned that 
one of the big events was the 
FREE style. He was badly dis­
appointed to learn that nothing 
was being given away except ex­
citement. And next Friday after­
noon there will be plenty of that 
let loose when Franklin and Mar­
shall will try to drown the Plaid 
swimmers. Excitement is one of 
those things there will be nothing 
else but, for Tech has decided to 
show the Philadelphians just how;, 
swimming should be done. Rumor 
has it that some of the boys are 
dieting on cork dust, with water- 
wings for desert. All seriousness 
aside, though, extra quantities of 
soap arc being ordered that all the 
speed boys may be well lathered 
up and so slip through the watei 
with a minimum of friction. To 
those who have not attended any 
of the swimming meets we would 
like to say that they are losing 
one of the thrills of a lifetime, for 
there is actually more hollering 
and excitement to the square inch 
than in the best taxi cab riot East 
Liberty has yet staged.
Friday afternoon will afford the 
first opportunity for ardent follow­
ers to sec, hear, and fell our var­
sity swimmirig team in competitive 
action. A dual meet is scheduled 
with Franklin and Marshall to be­
gin at 4:30. Admission will be 
free, and an option of shower or 
no shower is given with each scat 
in the first and second rows. As 
an added attraction, the Plebes will 
swim against Allderdice High.
For about the first time the 
Scotchmen will swim against a 
dark horse, or -should we say a 
dark fish. This situation prevails 
because this will be our first meet 
with Franklin and Marshall. As 
Homer would have said, had he only known about it,
'/With their strength unknown 
And victories unsung,
This meet will be 
An interesting one.
Why don’t you come 
And give support,
For that’s the way 
To win this sport.”
Pitt played host to our team on 
February 12, and made a fair job 
of it, too. When the mist cleared 
away we found ourselves on the 
small end of a 39 to 23 score. 
Taking this into account and the 
general trend of past years, then 
extrapolation shows that the time 
is rapidly approaching when Tech’s 
swimmers will be kicking water in 
Pitt’s face.
Basler is our nomination for Car­
negie’s Hall of Fame. In the re­
cent Ifitt meet Jack took first place 
in the diving, another Scotchman’s 
free-style. Such a victory in his line 
is considered on a par with our 
proverbial touchdown against Pitt. 
Schafer and Edwards are supplying 
thrills galore in the dash events. 
The former was just nosed out of 
first place on two occasions against 
Pitt. In the same meet Captain 
Sangster all but copped first place 
the breast stroke, and we’ll see 
him hahg up a number of red rib­
bons before the season is over. 
The Pitt score shows that Coach 
Risendorph is getting the best re­
sults in recent years. More power 
to him!
The Plebes found going tough 
against the University School of 
Cleveland last Saturday. Thev 
managed to get only eight of the 
59 points. It is only fair to say 
that the freshmen were without 
their full strength. Jerge swam the 
feature race, just missing first 
place by a margin in the 200 yard 
free-style. He accounted for one 
more point in the diving event. 
Franke, Bardzil, Goldberg and 
Coulter each landed third place in 
their events.
the Washingtons played above their 
heads and the score at the end of 
die quarter was 8-7 with the Plaid 
still out in front. From this point 
the Plebes held the visitors entirely 
at their mercy ancl at half time 
PINGN leading 16-9.
During the opening minutes of 
the second half- the Pelebs bunchcd 
a number of baskets on beautifully 
executed plays and brought the 
score to 26-11. From this point 
the Plebes- were content to. hold 
their opponents in check and the 
final score was 36-15.
The game was extremely rough 
throughout and both teams scored 
a number of . .points.. from free 
throws. Much credit is due to Buck 
Snyder for the fine manner in 
which he handled this game which 
started out more like a free for all 
brawl than a basketball game.
Burns was the outstanding per­
former for the Plaid being all over 
the floor -nd scoring two field 
goals and seven out of twelve free 
throws. Fergus and Smith scored 
three field goals apiece to share 
second honors in scoring. W & J 
was held well in check only scor­
ing three field goals for the entire 
game.

Hogan’s inauguration of a new style of play brought home the bacon for Carnegie last Saturday night. Naturally we would rather have Coach “Buzz’s” squad win all of their contests but win or lose, we’re for Hogan.
BASKETBALL
There are only two weeks more 
before the basketball tournament, 
which is scheduled for the first 
week in March. It is very im­
portant that every player attend 
all practices this week, for at the 
end of the week the list of- the 
class squads will be posted. Only 
those women who find their names 
on this list, which will be piaced 
on the W. A. A. boards in M. M. 
C. C, and in the gym hall, and on 
the bulletins in the Arts College 
arc to report at the regular prac­
tice hours next week.
The purpose of this new pro­
cedure is to enable the different 
classes to organize their teams and 
to play a few practice ..games with 
each other in preparation for the 
tournament of the following week.
The names of the players with 
the number of practices each has 
attended, and the number of prac­
tices that arc required for squad 
eligibility are to be found on the 
bulletin board in the gym. As the 
list is complete, anyone not find­
ing her name there and who be­
lieves herself eligible should report 
at once to Harriet Hanna, the 
manager.
Tuxedo has come into populrr 
favor as class attire at Georgic 
Tech since one of the professors 
there asserted that he showed 
partialitj' to well-dressed students 
when giving out the grades.

'AATHLETICS
PROGRESS!
In looking back over the old 
semester perhaps the casual observ­
er will not see any striking accom­
plishments In the field of women’* 
athletics here at Carnegie, but the 
accomplishments arc there just the 
same.
At the beginning of the school 
year, the W. A. A. Board held its 
Play Day for Freshmen. From the 
Play Day, which was such a sue-, 
cess that the Board should like to 
establish it as a permanent fca 
ture of its activities, there followed 
a series of^ similar successful under­
takings.
The spirit and interest in ath­
letics among Carnegie women has 
shown marked advance in the past 
few years, but last semester the 
progress was even more noticeable 
than ever before. Because all the 
managers, of the past as well as 
current sports, have, worked .very 
hard to create greater interest in 
their particular sports, they, have 
been able to make the .satisfactory 
report that Carnegie women, arc 
responding admirably. The old cry 
for team members is .unnecessary, 
for now there are more . than 
enough candidates.
As a result of this very impor 
tant increase in interest of our 
women athletes, the W. A. A. has 
added another sport to its sched­
ule. As hockey, which has not 
been an organized sport at Car 
ncgie for a long time, is Dccbming 
more and more popular throughout 
the country, a hockey manager was 
again placed on the , Board last 
spring. The new sport, wnich was 
installed as a mipor sport, closed 
a satisfactory 'season that promi?' 
cd a successful future’ in which 
hockey will no doubt assume its 
rightful position as a very valuable 
major sport.
Although it is commendable to 
open a new sport season, it is~ even 
more commendable to close fen old 
one, especially if the old one hap­
pens to be tennis. For the first 
time for several years, the women s 
double's tennis tournament was 
completed in spite of bad weather 
and the usual difficulties.
The bowling season opened last 
fall for the first time with bowling 
as a major sport. The senior team 
ended a brilliant career by retaining 
their four-year title to. the climi: 
pionship and receiving their cup at 
the W. A. À. Awards Party tba;
formally closed the fall sports
season.
The winter sports season open­
ed with swimming, basketball and 
rifle, sports which are still in 
progress. The coaches, who are 
also the managers, are to be con­
gratulated for the remarkable im­
provement in the skill and attend­
ance of the participants in these 
sports. Botji Susan Knorr, swim­
ming manager, and Harriet Hanna, 
basketball manager, are doing ex­
cellent work; and Floy Sample, al­
though only a Sophomore, has 
proved her capacity aà manager of 
the very difficult sport of rifle.
Every sports season has shown 
a great improvement in spirit and 
attendance over those of other 
years, and it is hoped each year 
will add something more to the ad­
vancement of women's athletics on our campus.
Now that exams arc jver the 
basketball and swimming, candir 
dates may resume practice and prer 
pare themselves for the approach­
ing tournaments, which will close 
the winter sports season.

These Shocking Foreigners
It is not an uncommon experience to read foreign dis­
patches in daily newspapers describing the dramatic reactions 
of students towards a new political policy. Because we our­
selves are "students” the word catches our attention readily, 
and we usually read the entire article with interest.
Sòme of us arc frankly shocked at the means that foreign 
students adopt to show their' displeasure for a certain political 
act. We read how they parade streets, engage in physicial com­
bats, and even end up in the court room. Somehow, the thought 
disturbs the average student, especially when he considers the 
placidity with which he reacts to political moves in the United 
States. He rationalizes by concluding that foreign students arc, 
after all, more hot blooded and therefore, cannot help' becomin 
excited.
That, however, is only rationalization of the sort that the 
lazy,,indifferent person practices every day. The blood pressure 
of a student has nothing to do with the interest he takes in his 
country’s affairs. The Japanese and the Chinese are thought to 
be some of the most stoical people in the world, yet, almost 
every day we read some item that links up the Japanese and 
Chinese student with some issue of their governments.
It is, of course, ridiculous to imagine American students 
shouting curses in front of the White House, or parading the 
streets of Syracuse because they were against prohibition.
The United States government is satisfactory enough to 
discourage any demonstration against it. But the present situa­
tion among the majority of students is ridiculous, The average 
American student knows little or nothing about the affairs of 
his own government, let alone those of other governments.
He lets his attention dwell for a few moments on the largest 
headlines of a newspaper, and then turns to the sports page, the 
comic strip, or the fashion column. Fortunately, there, are sev­
eral students who arc not in this class. There is also the pos­
sibility that the average student will forget his mental inertia 
and Jake an interest in those things which arc of real concern 
<.o him.—Syracuse,
Playing With Peace
While the various world powers arc haggling, arguing, fight­
ing and scrapping at the London conference in a noble if some­
what. too ambitious fourth or fifth attempt to make future wars 
absolutely impossible, it is to1 be noted 'that the national incomc 
is still being expended in the interests of (he War God Mars 
and to the joy of those who use his playthings. All this dicker­
ing and quarreling as Id whether or not the primary nations 
shall have only Ifi capital ships or !I8 capital ships or 23 capital 
ships is pure peace publicity and bunk.
, .j’Jj'ach nation has entered the London conference, not be­
cause it wants to, but because the people of that nation wisli 
il) at everything possible shall be clone in the interests of world 
peace. The same pages of our daily newspapers which announce 
in glaring headlines that some' agreement is about to be reached 
at London also disclose that a division of the United States fleet 
will carry on quite extensive maneuvers in the Atlantic and the 
Caribbean. The same page also announces that the navy de­
partment has obtained an appropriatici of $25,000 to conduct 
tests in an endeavor to produce air ships that will equal the 220- 
niilc' planes now possessed by Britain.
What does all this peace business mean? What arc all these 
pacts and agreements for? Evidently the world wants ancl talks 
about peace, but is not ready for it. No doubt, if it can be ob­
tained cheaply and with no. loss of., prestige by a nation, it is 
certainly desired. Why should we‘think Peace in London and 
play at war in the Caribbean?—Lehigh. '

Prom afterthoughts! Well, the 
boys made a little money, much to 
everyone's surprise, and the affair 
was a decided success . . . The com­
mittee will all probably blossom 
forth in camel-hair coats before the 
year is out . . . Mr. Katz and his 
much heralded band were among 
those missing . . . They were sup­
posed to have put on a John Gil- 
bcrt-Jhn Tully affair the day before 
. . . F’unny they were on the radio 
from Washington the same night 
though . . . Anyway, Wcedc Meyer 
proved an able substitute . . .
Lots of famous people were there 
. . . The editor-in-chief of the Tar­
tan . . . Manager Dodo VVright, 
diminutive executive of the football 
team . . . The Debonair Charley 
Sclsam, minus his spats . . . Anne

president of Industries Senate . .
W. Robely Pfouts, Senior Builder 
extraordinary . . . Fact is, the whole 
place wfas infested with those lads 
. . . Jack Kerr, George Wright, 
Lou Buran, Joe Forminchclla, and 
several others . . . Oh, yes, Master 
Sigmund Holvcrstott, editor of the 
Puppet . . . Bob Galbrcath and his 
Battlc-ax . . . President of Thcta 
Tau was absent, but the vice presi­
dent, Henry Lloyd Bunker, Jr., was 
on hand . . . Howard Harpster, 
All-American quarter-back was kick­
ing around . . . Pansy Murdoch 
with the one and only , . . Tank 
Highbcrgcr, Ted Rosenzwcig, Pete 
Flanagan; John ICarcis, Andy Ycr- 
ina, J-Iow'ard Stauffer, Logan Web­
ster, George Nease, Wayne High. 
Art Weiss, and many other of our 
athletes, all as handsome as ever 
. . . Jimmy Traa surely looked 
handsome leading the affair with 
Miss McNary by his side ... Of 
course, Fred Sangstcr, president of 
our austere Student Council was in 
evidence . . . He kicked our girl 
early in the evening, and she’s still 
puffed up about it . . . Doris Mather 
was there, sans goldfish . 
Johnny Barnes with Betty Hoffman 
and her bass voice were tripping 
gaily about ... Of course, Dave 
Genter was on hand, also the 
smooth looking Clint Wcitzcl . . . 
Lots of others were there, too, but 
the thing happened so long ago 
that we’ve forgotten everybody . 
Jack Boyle is happy, though, the 
affair was, a paying proposition. *****
Random shots and r a n d o m 
thoughts. Anyone who has listened 
in on the Fleischman Yeast Hour 
has heard Rudy Vallcc tell us about 
the great fraternity of which lie 
happens to be a member, and has 
heard their song "Violets." Witl 
Rudy Vallcc and David Harold 
Eldredge Genter both wearing the 
pin, that fraternity surely is fon 
lunate. Some people have all the 
ludc. Imagine getting paid for the 
privilege of sitting beside Janet 
McClelland and Virginia Morgan. 
All this fell to Charley Donahoe, 
the well-known Senior Mechanical 
with the cute black hair, during 
registration. Tea dances are funny 
things. Any plcbc girl there is 
lucky if she gets ton feet with the 
same partner. Wait until she I: 
comes a Junior. She’ll stay and 
stay ami stay. We are about to 
reveal an identity. The president 
of Thcta Tau is none other than 
Henry Russell Loxtcrman, who i 
leaving tomorrow night for Welles­
ley.' lie’s giving, the girls up there 
a rare treat for lie’ll he at the 
Senior Prom. At the W. & J. 
basketball game, one of our fair 
plebes asked us if we didn’t think 
Dutch was an "Eyth" boy. The 
remains, were carried out imme­
diately. .
Cluck! Cluck!
INTERFRATERNITY FORMAL
(Continued from page 1) 
rqadincss, decorated with the ban­
ners and insignias of the various 
fraternities «on the campus.
Other than the elimination of 
the grand march the general pro­
gram for the evening will be simi­
lar to those of previous years, 
which have been so pleasurable to 
those in attendance. Many of the 
fraternities will continue the cele­
bration with breakfast parties at the 
individual houses. These parties 
have always been popular and well 
attended by the dancers.
In order to assure the financial 
success of the Intcrfraternity For­
mal, each fraternity has been given 
tickets equal in number to two- 
thirds of the membership and one- 
lialf the number of pledges. In 
each fraternity those tickets which 
are not sold will be bought by 
that respective fraternity. Usually 
the chapters encounter little diffi­
culty in disposing of their tickets, 
but it is hoped, by thus explaining 
the conditions, that disputes will be 
avoided this year. This method of 
distribution relieves the committee 
of the serious responsibility of sell­
ing and disposing of the tickets.
Alumni who anticipate attending 
the Formal may obtain their tick­
ets from any of the fraternitic 
they wish.
The committee which has worked 
so hard to make this year’s Inter 
fraternity Formal a succcss consist 
of t he following students: Joe
Herbst", chairman, Beta Thcta Pi 
Vincent Broomhali, Beta Thcta Pi; 
Bud Murray, Sigma Nu; Janie: 
Ashwcll, Delta Tau Delta, and 
William Bryant, Sigma Nu.
The chaperons for the evening 
arc: Dean Tarbcll, Dean Teeble, 
MY. 'and Mrs. Work, Mr. and Mrs. 
H-." S. -Hower, and Mr. and Mrs. 
Clayter.

‘Carnegie Drama Dept. Is Finest 
In America”, Says Otis Skinner
"The finest school of dramatic 
art in America” is the phrase that 
Otis Skinner, nationally known ac­
tor, used ,in describing the Drama 
Department at the Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology during a cur­
tain speech on February 7 at the 
Nixon Theatre while appearing in 
‘‘Papa Juan,” according to Mr.' 
Frank C. Harper’s column in the 
Pittsburgh Press.
Mr. Skinner, according to Mr. 
Harper, expressed his appreciation 
at the reception given his play and 
the general high regard accorded 
high-class drama in Pittsburgh. 
The actor commented on the fact 
that three graduates of the school 
were appearing that week in Pitts­
burgh. Naming the men lie con­
tinued:
"But tills is, after all, no sur­
prise,‘for you have here in Pitts­
burgh at the Carnegie Institute'of 
Technology, the finest school of 
dramatic art in America, and the 
quality of the work done in that 
school is attested by these young 
men and many others now playing 
in important dramatic produc­
tions.”
The three men named by Mr. 
Skinner were Hardie Albright, who 
appeared with Mr. Skinner in 
"Papa Juan"; Robert: Allen, known
during his student days as Robert 
Pike, who appeared with Fritz 
Leibcr in Shakespearean repertoire 
at the Alvin, and Henry Wads­
worth, the Joe Wadsworth of col­
lege da^ys, juvenile of the George 
Sharp Players.
The appearance of the three Car­
negie students created' wide com­
ment in the local press. One Writ­
er commented on the circumstan­
ces that the three actors mention­
ed all appeared several years ago 
in a production of "Hamlet” in the 
Little Theatre.
Albright was with the company 
of Eva La Gallicnnc for a year, 
and with George Arliss' ‘in "The 
Merchant of Venice” for four 
months’. More recently* lie has ap­
peared' with "Anne Forrest in 
"Gang War.”
Besides his work on the stage 
Joe Wadsworth has made two 
talking motion pictures, “Apple­
sauce,” which will soon be shown 
in Pittsburgh and "Slightly Scar­
let" in which Clive Brook is star­
red. He also appeared in "The 
Lady Lies" and "Flight.”
For two ' seasons Robert Allen 
has* played with' the Chicago Civic 
Shakespeare Society, Appearing, in 
almost every male' role written by 
Shakespeare.
20th Annual Exhibit 
Of Associated Artists
Of the three hundred seventy-nine 
works in the Twentieth Annaul Ex­
hibition of the Associated Artists of 
Pittsburgh, being held in, the Car­
negie Institute Galleries from Feb­
ruary 13 to ‘March 33, two hundred 
and five, are the productions of the 
faculty, students, and alumni of Ciir^ 
ncgic’s College of Fine Arts. The 
works of nine instructors, six pres-, 
cut .students, and fifty-five former 
students were, accepted by the com­
mittee, and won five of the possible 
ten prizes and honors.
“These statistics demonstrate the. 
growth and advancement of the 
school,” commented Professor Readio 
of the Arts faculty, “The percentage; 
of ‘Carnegie Tech’ work in the ex-, 
hibition has been increasing steadily 
from year to year. Last, year about 
50 % of the accepted works were 
‘Carnegie Tech’ productions. This 
year over half are by our students, 
former students, and instructors.”
The Carnegie Institute prize was 
awarded ,to Raymond S. Simboli, of 
the Painting and Decoration faculty, 
for a group of four oil paintings, 
the most interesting of which is prob­
ably Selp-Portrait. The Art Society 
of Pittsburrgh prize for the -best- 
portrait was awarded to Esther Topp, 
also of the Arts faculty, for her 
Beatrice' Rober, and exceedingly in­
teresting study of a little girl, a real 
one, hot glorified. And Samuel Rosen­
berg, another faculty member, won
the Euphcmia Bakcwcll prize for the 
best figure painting with The Gold 
Gown—the portrait of a girl whose 
golden, gowns adds a • bit of gold to- 
all of her surroundings. Vincent 
N.esbert and, Samuel Baer Filncr, 
former' studeqfs here, won first and 
second honors, respectively.
IT he present students who arc suc­
cessful in being represented in the 
exhibition arc Armando del Cimmuto, 
Katherine Dickey, Frank-R. Murray, 
Betty Powell, Alfred D. Reid, and 
Harry Schcuck.'
Among the outstanding paintings 
of the exhibition is A. J. Kostcllow’s 
Man With Guitar, which is present­
ed in an unusually forceful manner. 
Norwood MacGilvary, another Arts 
.instructor, has several portraits also 
done.. powerfully but with a clear, 
light-colored forccfujness, quite differ­
ent .from Mr. Kostcllow’s darker, 
more sombre force. Then there is 
Raymond S. Simboli’s Noon Hour, 
another example of vigorous force, 
but a third kind, not so definable. 
Another forceful painting is The 
Limited of Roy Hilton, a former 
Carnegie student. The prominent part 
of this painting« is the huge, silent 
concrete arches over which the 
“Limited” rushfcs. Two colored draw­
ings of Pittsburgh, Industrial Night 
by Hilda E. Vollkommer, a former 
student; and Night by Everett 
Warner, of the faculty, also attract 
through their powerful presentation.
. Mountains and hills are inspiringly 
painted* by Pittsburghers, who cer­
tainly should know them well. Moun­
tain Ranch by Wilfred A.'Readio is 
a sunshiny picture of steep western
THE FLY AND THE FLYWHEEL
A Fly lit on a Flywheel -and was startled when he found That the Flywheel was mechanically -going round and round.So he held his legs akimbo,, chuckling airly with glee,"Why, the thing that makes thc'Fywhcel go is obviously Me!”
The Fly lie rode the Flywheel for a little hour or so,And lie lui/zed in his excitement as lie murmured, "Watch it go!” ‘Pray, what other Fly could gQt a wheel a-spinning like a top? "But if I should leave this Flywheel it would obviously stop.”
The Fly retained tenaciously his airy little notion,Till by-and-by lie felt himself grow dizzy with the motion.So lie tumbled, but he. noticed as he lit upon the floor,That the wheel was going, obviously, faster than before.
O little Fly, O naughty, Fly, ’tis. piteous to feelThat your legs arc not the motor power that spins the awful’wheel;And it’s certainly a shocking and.-embarrassing surprisekYhcn a fact like this grows obvious to college students as Well as Flics.

Y. M. & Y. W. H. A. Entertains
This Thursday, February 20, at 
4:30 p. m., the Y. M. and Y. W. H. 
A. will entertain the students of 
Carnegie Tech and the University of 
Pittsburgh at the "Y" building on 
Bcllcficld avenue.
A program has been planned which 
will include readings by Gladys 
Schmit of Pitt and piano selections 
by James Miller of Carnegie Tech. 
All students from both Pitt and Car­
negie arc invited to attend.
Intercollegiate Clips
According to a report made by 
Dr. J. C. Austin of Colgate, the 
students of the University of Vi­
enna have many customs which 
would appear very strange in this 
country. Dueling is an essential 
qualification of a fraternity man. 
The students, lie claims, are scar­
red and bandaged as a result of 
their dueling contests, and honor 
is given the men who receive long, 
ugly scars.
The typical fraternity man never 
studies at the university, but spends 
his time loafing in the various buf­
fets and drinking places. Those 
who attend classes are forever 
eating; in the classrooms, when 
walking through the corridors, and 
usually the black brief cases which 
they carry contain only sandwiches.
Compulsory attendance at class 
is unheard of. A class for which 
two hundred had registered was 
put in a room seating only/ one 
hundred and ten. This did not 
crowd them since the average at­
tendance was only sixty, and the 
number present sometimes dropped 
to twenty-five.
Although the professors meet 
their classes in swallow-tail coats, 
the students are very slovenly. 
Even those with money apparently 
have no concern about their ap­
pearance. The women of Vienna, 
famed for their beauty, are not" 
beautiful at all, according to Dr. 
Austin, who claims that their shab­
by clothes and 'carebess appearance 
is revolting to one brought up in 
the more strict American culture.* * *
Perhaps our readers will pardon 
.us for a minute that we may com 
mend Marquette University for the 
excellence of its paper, The Trib­
une, "Sold on its Merits as a 
Newspaper." We only regret that 
we found nothing in it to crib.* * *
Girls at William and Mary Col­
lege cannot have dates unless they 
arc over 80—in their studies, of 
course. And the Michigan State 
News informs us that girls over 
80 get few dates. ’S good thing 
for girls in Oak Hall we don’t have 
that rule at Carnegie.

Some advice to those who have 
flunked. After all, dpn’t be so cut 
up about it. Others have flunked 
with ^ou. Many have flunked in 
the past; many more will flunk in 
the future; the profs will see .to 
that. Perhaps you can reschedule 
the course this .semester. If not, 
there’s summer school. Pittsburgh 
is delightfully dirty in hot, sticky 
summer weather. Or a fifth year. 
Perhaps the Grill will have im­
proved by then. As to those F’s
and R’s that are bothering you 
now, don’t take too seriously the 
razzing the fraternity gave you, or 
your girl’s interest, or the pleasure 
of your parents. Yes, yes, of 
course, the exam was too long to 
finish, everyone knows that it’s a 
rotten course, you had only omitted 
to hand in three assignments, the 
prof’s a terrible guy—hardboiled as 
hardboiled—and if they’d only make 
the courses interesting you could 
pass them all. Well, perhaps you 
won’t pass it next time, cither. 
Meanwhile, did you telephone home 
the news and reverse the charges? 
It was a good time to ask for a 
little extra to spend on books, 
wasn t it—the kind of books that 
arc pretty and go to danccs. Or 
perhaps you sent a telegram col­
lect. Be happy about it anyway. 
If you are reading this the chanccs 
are that you aren’t like those men 
who could spell "referee” or worse 
still “referrer” with their grades, 
and who were kicked out. As the 
immortal bard of Avon couldn’t 
have written, some are born to re­
ceive F’s and R’s. some manage 
to receive F’s and R’s, some have 
F’s and R’s thrust upon them. 
Back again to our labors. For an­
other semester we have to listen 
to the -prattle of the profs.
