CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PA.FAR TAN
Yale Adds 
To Tech Staff
Professor Elliott Dunlap Smith, 
Master of Saybrook College and 
Professor of Economics at Yale 
University, has been appointed 
provost and Maurice Falk Profes­
sor of Social ¡Relations at Carne­
gie Institute of Technology. As 
Provost, Professor Smith will be 
the general education officer at 
C. I. T., reporting to the President.
One of his important duties dur­
ing his previous year on campus 
was serving as Chairman of a 
Joint Subcommittee of the Col­
lege of Engineering and Science, 
of the Division of Humanistic and 
Social Studies, and of the Social 
Relations Program Committee. 
This committee had the respon­
sibility of preparing a plan of de­
velopment for the Social Rela­
tions program of the College of 
Engineering and Science.
A native of Chicago, Professor 
Smith received the A. B. degree 
from Harvard in 1913, the LL. B. 
degree in 1916, and an honorary 
M. A. degree from Yale in 1928. 
He began practicing law in Chi­
cago in 1916, and was then with 
the Council of National Defense 
in Washington during the First 
World War.
He was Personnel Manager of 
the Dennison Manufacturing 
Company, Framingham, Massa­
chusetts, from 1919 to 1928, also 
serving as Lecturer in Social 
Ethics at Harvard in 1926 and 
1927. Since 1928, Professor Smith 
has been Professor of Industrial 
Relations and Master of Saybrook 
College at Yale. During the past 
war, he was Director of Yale’s 
Committee on Student Prepara­
tion for War Service, which was 
responsible for the readjustment 
of undergraduate education for 
War.
Professor Smith is a trustee of 
several educational institutions. 
For many years he has been 
Chairman of the Advisory Com­
mittee on Industrial Relations of 
the National Industrial Confer­
ence Board. He is the author of 
Psychology for Executives, of 
Technology and Labor, and co­
author of Union-Management Co­
operation in the ‘Stretchout’ and 
has contributed numerous articles 
on industrial and educational sub­
jects to professional journals.
Professor Smith’s principal in­
terest, and the one which caused 
him to come to Tech, is the devel­
opment of professional education 
which is focused, not upon full­
ness of data and techniques, but 
upon helping the student to de­
velop while in college the power 
to think and to learn for himself 
as he matures in his profession, 
and to grow as a well-rounded in­
dividual and citizen.
Beaux Arts Ball 
Tickets on Sale
Tickets for the ultra-novel 
Beaux Arts Ball are to go on 
sale this week in the College of 
Fine Arts with two representa­
tives of each department selling 
them for $3.60 per person. The 
'ball is generally considered to be 
stag, but married couples will be 
admitted for the price of two 
tickets. Sales are restricted to 
students, faculty, and alumni of 
the College of Fine Arts.
This, the first Beaux Arts Ball 
since the spring of 1938, is the 
post-war revival of traditional 
costume balls which were held 
almost every year from 1915 on. 
The last one had as its theme 
the ancient Aztec culture, while 
in contrast this year’s will center 
around surrealism.
The music will be provided by 
Maurice Spitalny, one of Pitts­
burgh’s (best known orchestras,

Notice
All students interested in 
alleviating the crowding, in 
Skibo between the hours of 
11:30 and 1:30 each day are 
requested to get in touch with 
Mrs. Chew, Assistant Con­
troller, through interschool 
mail. Several jobs that can be 
filled by students are availa­
ble. Applicants must have 
two free hours.
Bridge Contest 
Winners Will Get 
New York Trip
An all-expense trip to New York 
and a week-end in the Ritz Carle- 
ton—that is what two lucky and 
skillful college bridge players are 
going to enjoy on April 26 and 27, 
when they will compete in the na­
tional finals of the Intercollegiate 
Bridge Tournament in Gotham 
town.
Entries from Skibo-practiced 
Tech duos who are masters at the 
art of regular duplicate contract 
are being passed to the local spon­
sor, Delta Skull, and chairman, 
Dick Storm, with the deadline set 
at Tuesday noon. Any two per­
sons may enter the tournament— 
two women, or a mixed pair—the 
only restriction being that all con­
testants must be undergraduates.
The local elimination will be 
held in the Union on a date to be 
announced later on the school bul­
letin boards. The field will be 
pared *to two tables and an alter­
nate couple or five couples in all. 
The final campus elimination will 
be under the direction of the In­
tercollegiate Bridge Tournament 
Committee, and the details of the 
play will be forwarded to them. 
After tabulating the play of all 
teams in Pennsylvania, the com­
mittee will select three pairs of re­
gional winners; and they will re­
ceive that coveted trip to New 
York for the finals.
The tournament was inaugurat­
ed in 1940 to stimulate the play­
ing of bridge' among college stu­
dents. The war halted the tour­
nament for several years, but it 
has now been resumed with 
Kansas State University, the last 
winner, being invited to defend 
its crown. Cornell, Brown, Penn­
sylvania, Dartmouth, Colgate, 
MIT, Hobart, and many other 
leading schools have entered in 
this year’s competition.

Rev. Thompson 
Given Plaque
At chapel on Tuesday, March 12, 
The Reverend Hugh Thompson 
Kerr was presented a plaque in 
recognition of the great spiritual 
work he has carried on at and 
near this campus. The plaque was 
presented to Rev. Kerr by Presi­
dent Doherty, who, upon receiv­
ing it from Prof. Dennison, pre­
sented it in behalf of the student 
branch of the Y.M.C.A.
The plaque was a framed copy 
of a resolution passed by the stu­
dent branch of the Y.M.C.A. It 
was presented to Reverend Kerr 
on the occasion of his recent re­
tirement as pastor of the Shady- 
side Presbyterian Church, where, 
as a nearby pastor, he has min­
istered to the spiritual needs of 
the students of Carnegie Tech. He 
was also one of those who were 
instrumental in the formation of 
the student chapter of the Y.M.C.
A. and helped activate the religious 
group known as Teknon.
Doctor Kerr, now President of 
the Alliance of Reformed Churches 
of the United States, recently re­
turned from a tour of Europe; and 
in his address in chapel, he told 
of the spiritual needs of the peo­
ples of the war-torn countries. He 
tried to impress upon the small 
gioup that attended the under­
standing which we must have of 
the spiritual breakdown of these 
people. He gave those who were 
fortunate enough to hear him a 
lot to think about.
The Chapel Choir sang “Hear, 
Lord our God” by Tschaikovsky 
and was directed by Millicent Hay. 
Ruth Bowser was the organist.
The entire text of the resolution 
is as follows:

AN EXPRESSION OF 
APPRECIATION

selor, and true friend, Dr. Hugh 
Thompson Kerr, has recently re­
tired from the ministry of the 
Shadyside Presbyterian Church,

Student Government Is One 
Of Oldest Traditions at Tech
Since Student Council is such 
a large and important organiza­
tion, many wonder just how it 
came into existence. From the 
first, the authorities at Tech rec­
ognized the fact that the students 
themselves should regulate the 
extra-curricular affairs as much as 
possible. Action was taken almost 
immediately for the second year, 
1906-1907, a Board of Student 
Activities was set up with a joint 
membership of faculty and stu­
dents. It supervised many of our 
early organizations such as the 
weekly paper, yearbook, orches­
tra, band, glee club, and several 
technical societies. To finance 
these organizations just mention­
ed, this body had the fund secur­
ed from the first activity fee of 
five dollars per student which was 
charged in 1909.
To control the governmental 
section of student life involving 
the election of Senate and class 
officers, as well as the manage­
ment of matters that required 
joint action of the entire student 
body, Student Council was form­
ed in 1917.
In 1923, the Board of Student 
Activities was merged with the 
Student Council. Thus the lead­ers of the Council and the treas-
The annual Soph Hop, sponsored jointly by Cwens and 
Scimitar, was held in the Men’s Gym on Saturday night from 
9 to 1. Bill LeRoy’s band provided the music, and Roger 
Borneman’s Decorations Committee provided the green-tinted 
atmosphere which was in keeping with the theme of the 
Shamrock Sham—so named in honor of old St. Pat. A.P.O.
furnished refreshments as usual
ury of the Board of Activities 
were brought together, producing 
Student Council. It ranked, then 
as now, as the senior governing 
body, and at that time was com­
posed of twenty voting and ten 
non-voting members, represent­
ing all groups, and elected to 
serve for one year.
The grant of powers extended 
to the Council included jurisdic­
tion over all day student activities 
and organizations, responsibility

Party To Be Held 
For Dr. Doherty
A party celebrating the tenth 
anniversary of the arrival of Pres­
ident and Mrs. Robert Doherty at 
C.I.T. will be held at the Univer­
sity Club on April fifth. In addi­
tion to the faculty, fifty guests are 
expected. Among these will be 
Mayor David L. Lawrence, the 
members of the Board of Trustees, 
and various other political, indus­
trial, and business leaders from 
this area. Professor Joseph B. 
Rosenbach is the Chairman of the 
Ticket Committee, and Max Ilan- 
num is in charge of the Publicity 
Committee.
War Department 
Makes Award To 
Dr. R. Coleman
Doctor Raymond W. Coleman, 
Associate Professor of Manage­
ment Engineering, has been 
awarded a War Department cita­
tion Jor his work while in service 
as a Lieutenant Colonel in the In­
formation and Education Division 
of the United States Army. The 
citation was made by Lieutenant 
General J. Lawton Collins, the 
Army’s Director of Information. 
Colonel Coleman’s assignment 
was to devise educational proced­
ures under field conditions, which 
methods were later adopted for 
use in other theaters.
General Collins’ citation states: 
“From 30 April 1945 to 19 Novem­
ber 1945 you made a major con­
tribution to the establishment and 
development in the field of the 
Army’s off-duty educational pro­
gram. As a result of your intelli­
gence and professional compe­
tence, and your devotion to the 
mission of this Division, educa­
tion opportunities of all kinds 
were made available to millions 
of service personnel. In carrying 
out this assignment, you estab­
lished relationships with com­
manding officers and devised pro­
cedures which were of value not 
only to the educational program, 
but to other aspects of the Infor­
mation and Education program 
and which set a standard of ex­
cellence worthy of high commen­
dation.”
Doctor Coleman received his
B. A. and M. A. from the Univer­
sity of Washington, and his Ph. D. 
from the University of Pittsburgh. 
Before coming to Carnegie Tech 
in 1929 as Assistant Professor of 
Management Engineering, he in­
structed in accounting at Oregon 
State College, The University of 
Michigan, and Detroit City Col­
lege. He returned to Tech thijs 
semester after three and a half 
years in service to resume his post 
as Associate Professor,

in the Black Cat, and fraternities 
added something extra to the 
evening with a little singing of 
their own when the band went 
out for intermission.
Tro turnout-for this dance was 
goou and the spirit seemed better 
than usual. Everyone was a little 
less formal than previously and 
seemed Lc enjoy himself thorough­
ly. V nen the dance floor proved 
too slippery during the early part 
of the evening, a number of the 
couples promptly moved away 
from the center of the floor to 
the rougher (and darker) areas on 
the sidelines. Toward the end of 
the dance, the orchestra began to 
ease up on its fast numbers and 
gave out with some slow and 
danceable tunes—played the way 
the composers wrote them.
At about one o’clock, the danc­
ers called it an evening and left 
in jam-packed cars and v/hatever 
part of Pittsburgh’s public trans­
portation system was still operat­
ing for such nightspots as the city 
has to offer—from Gammons in 
East Liberty to The Cottage near 
the airport. All agreed that Pat 
Baum, Cwen president and Arnie 
Christenson, social chairman of 
Scimitar, gave us one of the best 
informals the year will see.

All independent commuters, 
whether members of Citcom Clan

Editor’s Armchair
Don’t Let Down Now
People have very short memories. Last year at this time 
there was a World War going on. All the students on campus 
were aware of the pressure of the great struggle. They wanted 
to do all they could to aid in their country’s battle to secure a 
successful end of the conflict; they wanted to do all they could 
to make it easier for their brothers and their friends who were 
fighting the war. So they gave willingly to the United War 
Fund and to the Red Cross and to any other organization 
which promised to make life a little easier for the men in 
uniform. Now that the war is over, they have forgotten. They 
have forgotten the men who are still in service in Europe and 
Japan who are fighting the peace for them. They have 
forgotten that they owe something to the veterans who are 
no longer fighting their battles for them. They no longer 
contribute to the organizations that need their money to 
furnish aid and comfort to the men who fought the war.
The uses to which the money gathered by the Red Cross 
will be put this year may not seem nearly so dramatic as those 
for which last year’s funds were spent, but they are just as 
important. The majority of the funds collected by the organ­
ization this year will be used to make the lives of Americans 
in uniform overseas more endurable — to furnish recreation 
centers for them and to facilitate communication between 
them and their relatives at home. Much of the money given 
to the Red Cross will be used to alleviate the distress of men 
still in veterans’ hospitals. A large amount of it will be used to 
aid veterans in their adjustment to civilian life. The men 
who are giving years of their lives to secure world peace and 
the men who have already given years of their lives to end 
World War should not be forgotten. The organization which 
promises to make their existence a little easier should be 
supported.
The annual campus Red Cross drive is now in progress. 
Contributions have not come anywhere near reaching the 
established goal. We can all afford to part with a couple of 
dimes for the defense of our future. Let’s remember to give to 
the Red Cross.
To Dorm Students
A couple of centuries ago, the men who live in the dormi­
tories of CIT became very bitter about the fact that they do 
not obtain a combined room and board rate as do the dormi­
tory women on campus. Several committees of dormitory men 
discussed the problem with the administration, and the pe­
cuniary difficulties of the inhabitants of Scobel, Welch, and 
Henderson were discussed in this column. At first the adminis­
tration showed no sign of doing anything about the problem. 
Later, when they heard that Men’s Dorm Council was being 
reactivated, they promised to handle the difficulty through 
the elected dormitory representatives. Dormitory Council has 
now been active for at least six weeks, and nothing has as yet 
been done to solve the food problem.
The situation as it stood last semester remains essentially 
the same. Men are still being required to pay higher labora­
tory fees than Carnegie women. Men are still paying more 
for their rooms and their food than are Tech women. Veterans’ 
pay checks are still coming in late and extra money is still 
hard for all the dorm men to find.
A few months ago we would have demanded that the ad­
ministration do something to alleviate the sad plight of the 
dormitory men, but now we know better. We know that the 
men who run the place will do very little about anything until 
the students build large fires under them. Therefore, we 
suggest that if the dorm students really want and need to 
save money they are now spending on food, they should send 
their Dorm Council representatives to the Administration to 
demand that action be taken.

1945-46 was called to order at

VET’S COMPLAINT
It wasn’t so long ago that an 
ex-Tech student in service was 
standing at ease on a hot, dusty 
drill field, located 20 miles out­
side of an inhospitable Southern 
town. The happy thought of the 
recently passed G.I. Bill of Rights 
occurred to him and he rolled its 
provisions over his lips like drops 
of Napoleon-vitage brandy.
“Tuition paid in full—no more 
book expenses and lab fees—six­
ty-five a month to spend—
“Platoon, attention!” The ser­
geant from New York froze him 
back to the position of a soldier. 
“Youse guys is a buncha Sad 
Sacks.” There was more of this 
coming and the private left Tech 
for the more pertinent question 01 
the Infantry Drill Regulations.
In the years that passed, the 
private ducked 88’s on the ground, 
watched them burst nearby as 
flack, and sweated out Washing 
Machine Charlie. Then—unbeliev­
ably—peace! It was 85 points and 
home and out and home again. 
Not long afterwards, a newly 
made civilian climbed into a day 
coach and settled back happily 
for the ride to the fountainhead 
of his best dreams—school. The 
quiet atmosphere of learning, col­
lege dances, good old days of 
fun. There wasn’t much to worry 
about, for he had enough money 
saved from his discharge pay to 
tide him over until those G.I. 
checks arrived. The fraternity 
house was saving a room for him 
and Tech was laying out the wel­
come home mat in style.
The first day of school dawned 
in a hurry—and it started to turn 
those rose-colored dreams gray 
and then black.
“Since you have had this work 
last semester, we won’t review 
it. Applying the methods of in­
tegration to this area—” 
“Integration?”
“That’s a silly question. You 
should know that from freshman 
Chemistry.”
“But it’s been four years.” 
“Look it up, man—look it up.” 
“G.I.’s shouldn’t be sent to 
Tech—send them to state schools 
—thè government is sending 
them. And that idea of continuing 
the trimester — harrrumph! I 
haven’t had a decent vacation in 
years!”
“I don’t know much about this 
course—the regular instructor is 
teaching one of those new-fangl- 
ed versions of it—you see I’m 
really an English instructor, but 
—er, uh—if a ten pound block 
falls—oh yes, there won’t be any 
books for about six weeks—now 
about that block. Let’s see—!” 
Professor, I rfem’t »ive a dartin
about your vacation. I don’t care 
if you didn’t teach this subject 
before. I want an education. I 
know that I’m not a good student 
now and that ten are welling to 
replace me—but I’m asking you 
to forget this line of bull you’ve 
been handing out and start teach­
ing to the veterans. Review past 
work as much as you can. Collect 
my homework, correct it, and re­
turn it so that I can see what 
I’ve done wrong, Put some more 
effort into this course. For this 
semester and maybe another one,
I need some help.
A veteran is no one special. He 
is just a fellow who happened to 
be too healthy or who maybe 
wanted to help Uncle Sam a bit, 
what with a war and such. But 
you promised us an education— 
a good one—when we got back. 
Now we are back and we’re call­
ing your hand. Let’s see what 
you’ve got.
(Veteran’s name withheld 
on request.)
ON DORM COUNCIL
Two weeks ago, the “End Man 
on the Senior Fence” registered 
several complaints on the unjust 
punishment of two dorm students 
by dorm council. Not being famil­
iar with the facts of the case, I 
am avoiding any issue with his 
statements. However, his accusa­
tions do reveal the existing weak­
ness in the present form of student 
government. Student government 
at Tech by way of dorm coun­
cils, student councils, etc. is a very 
feeble and limited form of self- 
government.
Previous to enrolling at Car­
negie Tech, I spent two years at a 
Liberal Arts College which is one 
of the few colleges which prides 
itself in its student government. 
Its honor system is widely known 
as one of the outstandingly suc­
cessful honor systems in the coun­
try. Having been indoctrinated in­
to the principles of such a system, 
Carnegie Tech’s student govern­
ment strikes me as out-dated and 
highly restricted. However, before
I go further, I should mention the 
differences in schools. Tech is a 
larger, co-education institutional 
located in a city where a large 
number of students commute. S. B. 
is a small women’s college located 
in the country with the majority 
of students living in dorms. As a 
result of these differences one stu­
dent government cannot be suc­
cessfully transplanted into another 
school. Nevertheless, I shall com­
pare principles and practices for 
what they are worth.
At S. B. student government is 
an integral part of every student’s 
life. From the days he registers, a freshman is continually exposed
Harry Thor, and Aubrey Caplan.
The Intercollegiate Bridge 
Tournament will be handled by 
Delta Skull.
Mr. Straka proposed that the 
committee chairmen submit a list 
of the policies concerning their 
committees for the incoming Stu­
dent Council.
The meeting was adjourned at 
6:10 P. M.
Respectfully submitted,
Barbara Irwin, 
Secretary.
Employment
Have you considered your sum­
mer vacation at a camp? If camp­
ing life appeals to you, have you 
considered acting as a counselor 
at one of the many summer camps 
in operation throughout the coun­
try? Many requests have come 
to the Student Employment Of­
fice asking for both men and 
women to act as counselors at 
various camps. There is a special 
need for people in the following 
fields:
Dietetics
Sports
Dramatics
Handcrafts
Art
This is a healthy enjoyable way 
to spend your summer profitably. 
If interested, you may obtain 
specific information from Mrs. 
Kreigline, Ind. 155-A.
to its principles and eventually 
inherits an active pride in its suc­
cess. For the first six weeks, mem­
bers of the student government in­
struct small groups of Freshmen 
on the rules of the school and 
the principles of the honor sys­
tem. A handbook published by the 
students is the Freshman’s text­
book and bible. After six weeks 
the Frosh are given an -exam. If 
they flunk this exam, they are 
auomatically campused until they 
pass.
Main points of this system which 
is so thoroughly imbued into en­
tering students are:
The Honor systems require that 
every student is on his honor to 
report all violations of student 
regulations, particularly his own. 
A violation of this trust is a far 
more serious offense than the 
breaking of any rule. Student 
pressure has made the honor sys­
tem. It is respected and obeyed. 
Furthermore it works.
As for the rules and regula­
tions themselves, they are drawn 
up by the students and enforced 
by the students. The administra­
tion and faculty act only in ad­
visory capacity on revision of 
regulations and severe punish­
ments. There are no dictators. 
Dorms are run by the students 
without interference or assistance 
from the housemothers. Students 
learn about democratic govern­
ment by practicing democratic 
government. College students are 
certainly old enough to be en­
trusted with their new own self- 
government. I’ve seen it done. It 
can work and to the benefit of all 
concerned.
At Tech the students take no 
real interest in their self-govern­
ment; they not only fail to sup­
port their dorm council and dorm 
regulations but they actually op­
pose them. Such a situation causes 
resentment and misunderstand­
ings. A self-government without 
the co-operation of its members is 
a worthless organization and often 
more harmful than useful.

Dr. Mehl Gives 
Lecture Tour
Dr. Robert Franklin Mehl, Di­
rector of the Metals Research Lab- 
ratory and Head of the Depart­
ment of Metallurgical Engineering 
of Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy, was sent by Coordinator of 
Inter-American Affairs, Mr. Nel­
son A. Rockefeller, to give a ser­
ies of lectures on metallurgy in 
the city of San Paulo, Brazil, fre­
quently described as the Pitts­
burgh of South America. On ar­
riving in San Paulo, he organized 
a course in metallurgy in iron and 
steel, both production metallurgy 
and the treating and use of steel, 
presenting it to a group of one 
hundred and fifty industrialists. 
During his stay in Brazil, Dr. 
Mehl assisted in the organization 
of the first Brazilian Metallurgical 
Society known as the “Associacao 
Brasileira de Metais.” This society 
had its first meeting during his 
stay, and he delivered the inaug­
ural address entitled The Historic 
Development of Metallurgy. The 
lectures which Dr. Mehl gave on 
the metallurgy of iron and steel 
have been translated into Portu­
gese and published in a book in 
Brazil. It is called Metalurgia Do 
Ferro E Do Aco. During his last 
week there, Dr. Mehl was in­
formed toy the President of the 
University of San Paulo and the 
President of The School of En­
gineering that he had been award­
ed the honorary degree of “doc­
tor! honoris causas” in view of 
the many scientific papers he had 
published and the services he had 
rendered the school.
C.W.C.A. Tea Dance 
Proves Unsuccessful
Last Wednesday afternoon, 
March 13, the Carnegie Women’s 
Christian Association held a tea 
dance in Thistle Hall for the bene­
fit of the World Student Service 
Fund. Students danced to the 
tunes of name bands, on records 
of course.
One hundred people attended 
the dance, but unfortunately the 
women outnumbered the men. 
The dance was not regarded, by 
the women at least, as a social 
success.
The proceeds from the dance 
will go to the World Student Serv­
ice Fund. The Service Fund is an 
organization of students in Amer­
ica and Great Britain which raises 
money to help other students in 
countries that were devastated by 
the war.

CIT Professors 
Speak on Art
“The Enjoyment of the Arts,” a 
series of illustrated lectures spon­
sored by the Isaac Seder Educa­
tional Center, will be presented on 
seven Mondays from March 18 
through May 13 at 8:15 at the Y.

Ex-Techite4Robbie’ Robison 
Returns to Teach Art Here
Robert S. Rotoison, a Tech 
graduate and ex-G. 1. is back at 
Tech, tout this time as an instruc­
tor. He is teaching drawing to 
other ex-G. I.’s who either met 
him when he was with the U. S. 
Army in Europe or saw his name 
in Stars and Stripes, the Army 
newspaper.
“Robie” served in the E. T. O. 
as a “T-5” with divisional head­
quarters in the 99th Infantry Di­
vision. The 99th or Checkerboard 
Division is famed as one of the 
two divisions in the Ardennes. 
They also were active at the 
Rhine Bridgehead break-through 
During his army career, “Robie” 
contributed regularly to the Stars 
and Stripes in form of long fact­
ual articles, “on the spot” 
sketches, and cartoons. Following 
“V-E” day he helped to organize 
an educational program for the 
99th Division and later was trans­
ferred to Shrivenham American University in England where he 
taught drawing and commercial 
art to American G. I.’s. Several 
of the students in his classes here
at Tech are former members of 
his old class at Shrivenham.
A few years back, “Robie” 
wrote and illustrated a pseudo­
child’s toook, Little Alfie. The 
story of the book was set to 
music by Albert Coats, conductor 
of the London Philharmonic Or­
chestra. While “Robie” was in 
London, he was given the honor 
and thrill of hearing the music 
played.
“Robie” was a graduate of Fine 
Arts in the class of 1930. While 
at Tech, he was a member of Phi 
Kappa Phi, Tau Sigma Delta, and 
Pi Delta Epsilon. He was art ed­
itor of the Thistle and the Pup- 
pett (forerunner of the Scottie), 
and also contributed some work 
to the Tartan. After graduation 
and previous to his Army career 
he worked in New York doing 
book illustrations and advertis­
ing. Back in civilian life again, he 
has continued where he left off 
and has added teaching to his 
work in advertising and book il­
lustrations. He has recently mar­
ried, and has somehow managed

A.P.O. Holds 
Formal Initiation
On Friday, March 15th at 7:30
A. P. O. Scouting Honorary, held 
its formal initiation at the Carne­
gie Union. Those initiated were 
Robert Teasdale, Vincent Benya, 
Karl Weber, Daniel Wallace, 
Chen Choa Foo, Marty Colnes, 
Don Koenig, Howard Rest, John 
Seward, Bill Doherty, and Fred­
rick Sorenson.
Present were Dr. Gregg and 
Kent Shaffer. After the ceremony 
there was a refreshment period 
and the boys sang. Afterward they 
went to the freshman dance!
(it’s still a secret and he won’t 
tell how) to find a house. Pitts­
burgh doesn’t bother “Robie” one 
bit (he’s used to it) and he enjoys 
his teaching at Tech too.
Dr. Work announced recently he 
expects to have a representative 
of the Veterans’ Administration at 
the Veterans’ Center soon, for two 
days a week. The V A man will 
be able to handle business which 
formerly required a trip to the 
downtown offices.
In the past many difficulties 
have arisen from lack of closer 
liaison between the administration 
here and the Regional Office of the
V A. In one instance, a veteran’s 
application for education was lost. 
After attending classes for some 
time, he was asked to fill out an­
other which was dated as of that 
date by the Regional Office. This 
meant a difference of two months 
subsistence and the tuition and ex­
penses for the same period.
Which brings up another matter 
still awaiting adjustment: had the 
veteran in question been a former 
officer, payment of tuition and 
subsistence could have been made 
retroactive to the date on which 
he entered school. This would 
have been true for the tuition even 
though he had been on terminal 
leave. Payment of enlisted men’s 
expenses and subsistence begins 
on the date their case is accepted 
by the V A.
Terminal Furlough?—A bill has 
been sponsored in congress to give
Urban League 
Op ens Drive
The campaign of the Urban 
League of Pittsburgh opened on 
March 10 with a youth conference 
at the Chatham YWCA at 3:00 
P. M. This year’s campaign, like 
the other yearly campaigns, is de­
signed to bring before the public 
the fact that Negroes, as Ameri­
cans, have equal rights to jobs 
which their skills and ability mer­
it, and is aimed specifically at Ne­
gro youth. The Urban League 
will emphasize with industrial 
and business people that his in­
dustry and business will be more 
successful if he hires the people 
who can do his job best, regard­
less of racial or religious origin.
Previous to the official opening, 
Dr. Alphonse Heningburg, In­
structor in Education at New York 
University and Director of Edu­
cation Services for the National 
Urban League, will hold a press 
conference. Dr. Heningburg is 
concerned with educating the 
American people regarding prob­
lems of race relations and techni­
ques for dealing with them.
On March 17, at 4:00 P. M., the 
campaign will close with a mass 
meeting at Schenley High School 
which is open to the public. At 
this meeting, Harold A. Lett, who 
has recruited Negro workers and 
has spent three years as director 
of the Division of Negro Welfare 
and Statistics, Department of La­
bor, will speak on the subject, 
Job Opportunities Without Regard 
to Race, Creed, Color, or National 
Origin.
During the entire week, infor­
mal conferences will be held 
with young people and employ­
ers throughout Pittsburgh. It is 
hoped that this campaign will 
serve to bring before the public 
the intensive fight that the League 
has always put forth to prove that 
American minorities are Ameri­
cans still and deserve every eco­
nomic opportunity which America 
can offer.
terminal furloughs to enlisted men 
who have had less than thirty 
days’ furlough for each year of 
service. These would be made 
retroactive.
Chocolate Words—General Her- 
shey said, “A veteran is entitled 
to his old job back, period.” 
According to the Scripps-Howard 
newspapers, the Supreme Court 
probably will soon be called on to 
make a decision on whether or not 
a veteran can displace a man with 
more seniority than he. Some­
times even after a veteran is given 
seniority for his service time, he 
does not have more than the man 
who would give up a job to make 
way for him. Two Federal Dis­
trict courts have ruled for senior­
ity and two for the veteran. A 
Circuit court has given the prefer­
ence to the veteran.
Section Eight Again—While all 
this is going on, the only legisla­
tion giving job rights to veterans 
will expire in May. Job rights 
are provided by Section 8 of the 
Selective Service Act which states 
that a person who left a job to en­
ter the armed forces is entitled to 
the same, or one of “like seniority, 
status, and pay.”
Veterans may now join the 
Tecvets by going to the Veterans 
Center and asking for Miss June 
Bicht.
Former Tech students who re­
turned from the service were al­
lowed to take the old Physics 
course, E-81, under Instructor 
Rafelli, part time Architecture 
student. Now they’re wondering 
about the privilege of it all. So 
far they don’t even have texts.
Harry Thor became the father 
of a Miss Norma Jean Thor last 
Friday evening. Mrs. Thor is do­
ing nicely, thank you.
Frosh Give Show 
At Stag Dance
On Friday night, March 15, the 
Freshman Class of Margaret Mor­
rison held a dance in Thistle Hall 
for the freshmen from the three 
schools. The Maggie Murphs act­
ed as hostesses and made sure 
that all the fellows met the girls. 
The climax of the evening was 
the entertainment, “M.C’d.” by 
Joan J^r-aunston, Gloria Bergman 
sang Lmbraceable You, accom­
panied by Jeanne Fisehman at the 
piano. She also sang several en­
cores, including Chain Store 
Daisy. Then Jane Knoer and Dot- 
tie Petroni played Malaguena and 
another number in duet form. 
Joel Bigelman led the whole 
group in an Allouptte and Bob 
Schoenberger gave out with some 
of his really solid boogie that set 
-everyone’s feet tapping. Finally, 
Marian Armstrong, Virginia Row­
ley, and Sylvia Davis, accom­
panied by Dottie Petroni, sang 
Mood Indigo, Smoke Gets in Your 
Eyes, and Summertime in three 
part harmony. After the enter­
tainment there was more dancing 
until one o’clock. Everyone had 
a very enjoyable evening.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MARCH 19, 1946
Presenting Chestt e Mailman. 
Tech’s Most Longed-For Male
Yes, there he is, coming around 
the corner! I hope he has a letter 
for me. Just one, that’s all I ask! 
These familiar remarks can be 
heard every morning and after­
noon in any of the dormitories on 
campus when “Chester” appears 
on the scene. In his slate-blue 
uniform, he has become a tradi­
tional campus figure, loved by 
everyone.
Chester’s full name is Maurice 
B. Chester. When asked about his 
family, he quaintly remarked, “I 
have one wife and five children.” 
Although he has been in the em­
ploy of the government for twen­
ty-seven years, he has been carry­
ing mail for only seventeen years! 
Not only does he have to get up 
at 5 a. m. to start work at 6, but 
he also has to work until 3:30 
p. m. He really likes it though, so 
he says, for “I come in contact 
with so many pretty girls.” Since 
he is so tired after work, he has 
no particular hobbies but sim­
ply likes to “sit down and enjoy 
life.”
When it comes to personality, 
Chester has so much that it radi­
ates from him. Besides just say­
ing “hello,” he also calls you by 
name, so marvelous a memory 
does he have. Oh, wait a minute— 
he used to get very angry when 
the Delt cocker spaniel, Cindy 
Belle, saw him coming, because 
Cindy definitely didn’t like him. 
In fact, when Chester would go 
to the door of the Delt house, he 
would open it slowly and quietly, 
peek in and look around. If he 
didn’t see Cindy, he would rush 
over to the table, throw down 
the mail, and rush out again. 
Many were the times though that 
he was slightly tattered about the 
legs.
Often you can’t get your mail 
from Chester when he first comes 
to the dorm, especially if he hasn’t
Music Honorary 
Holds Meeting
The Carnegie Tech Chapter of 
Phi Mu Alpha, national men’s 
Music honorary, is being reactiv­
ated. A preliminary organization­
al meeting was held in the 
Union on March 11, and another 
meeting will be held on March 25 
in the Union. All former members 
of the CIT chapter are extended 
an invitation to attend. The meet­
ing will convene at 9 P. M., and 
will be followed by refreshments.
Students in the Music Depart­
ment and those who participate in 
the activities of the Glee Club 
and the Kiltie Band are eligible 
for membership.
There are chapters of Phi Mu 
Alpha on 90 campuses throughout 
the nation, for it is the leading 
men’s music honorary in the Unit­
ed States.
The Carnegie Alpha Omega 
Chapter is definitely in the pro­
cess of reactivation, since new 
members will be taken in soon.
Science Club Meets
On March 13, the Science Club 
held a dinner meeting in the pri­
vate dining room of Skibo. After 
the dinner, all of the girls who 
were employed last summer gave 
an account of what type of work 
they had done; most had done 
laboratory work of some sort.
Following this, some of the 
members went to see “The Mer­
chant of Yonkers” in the Fine Arts 
Theater.
The meeting was very well at­
tended. Dr. Harold L. Lang, head 
of the Science Dept., Mrs. Lang, 
Dr. Miller and Miss Douglas of the 
Chemistry Dept., Mrs. Hood and 
Miss Tuttle of the Biology Dept., 
and about twenty members of the 
club were present.

finished reading your post cards 
and the return addresses on your 
letters. Imagine, he can even re­
member from whom you get your 
regular mail.
There was one particularly fun­
ny incident which he related to 
me; however, it didn’t happen in 
the dorm. One day he gave a long 
official-looking letter to a woman 
who said, “I could just kiss you 
for bringing this to me.” Backing 
away, Chester asked, “Why the 
sudden emotion?” She joyously 
replied, “This is my final divorce 
decree.”
Far from modest, Chester him­
self admits that he is the “best 
little carrier that the dorms ever 
had.” We all think so too.
Young Musician 
Appears Tonight
Two of the most remarkable 
young talents of the present time, 
Lorin Maazel, conductor, and 
Patricia Travers, violinist, will ap­
pear with the Pittsburgh Sym­
phony Orchestra in its next con­
cert in the Tuesday evening series 
on March 19 at Syria Mosque. 
Lorin Maazel will conduct a num­
ber of excellent classical and semi- 
classical pieces, including Sibelius’ 
“Valse Triste” and a selection 
from Gershwin’s “Of Thee I Sing.” 
Miss Travers will play a violin 
concerto with the Orchestra.
Lorin Maazel, who has had a 
sensational success, will be just 16 
years old this month. He has 
graduated from Peabody High 
School in this city and plans to go 
to college this fall at both Tech 
and Pitt. It will not be his first 
visit to our school as a student, 
for he studied musical theory un­
der Dr. O’Brien, formerly a mem­
ber of the music department.
Young Lorin’s first major feat 
was conducting the NBC Sympho­
ny Orchestra in New York at the 
age of 11. Later he conducted the 
Pittsburgh Symphony and was 
thrilled when his teacher, Associ­
ate Conductor Vladimir Bakalein- 
ikoff of that organization, played 
first viola under his direction. Now 
a robust young man of five and a 
half feet in height, with brown 
eyes and dark hair, he has expand­
ed his field of endeavor to include 
violin playing (he will give a vio­
lin concert in Pittsburgh on April 
30) and has written a song which 
will be introduced over the air by 
John Charles Thomas. If these 
past performances are any indica­
tion, the March 19th program at 
the Syria Mosque should be a com­
plete success.
Notice
Thursday evening at 7:30 
there will be a combined 
meeting of the senior and 
freshman Y-Cabinets. All men 
students interested in Y work 
and desiring to affiliate with 
the Y-Cabinet are asked to at­
tend. This will be an organiza­
tional meeting for the fresh­
man Cabinet.
Hoffman Elected 
Bagpiper Editor
Residents of the dormitory sys­
tem of C.I.T. met last Thursday 
evening at 7 p. m. in the Union 
to select the staff of the Dorm 
Bagpiper. Since he has been very 
active in the reorganization and 
promotion of the paper, Everett 
“Tut” Hoffman was unanimously 
elected to the position of Editor- 
in-chief. Others elected to staff 
positions were: Managing Editor, 
Anna Jane Zimmerman; News 
Editor, Dick Storm; and Business 
Manager, John Fockler. These 
members of the staff met to choose 
the remaining members who are: 
Women’s Editor, Eleanor Alex­
ander; Circulation Manager, De- 
lores DeFiore; and Sports Editor, 
Dick Heckman. The staff is very 
fortunate to have the services of 
such top-notch photographers as 
Dick Bock, Jere Kiser, and Bob 
Robinson.
Of the fifty odd students who 
were present at this meeting, by 
far the major portion were resi­
dents of the women’s dormitories. 
What happened, fellows? Plans 
were made for the first publica­
tion of the Bagpiper which will 
be on or about Wednesday, April 
10. Copy deadline will be Friday, 
April 6 at five P. M. Assignment 
sheets will be posted in promi­
nent places on campus, and each 
of the dormitories will be repre­
sented by one or more members 
who will report items of interest. 
Individual contributions will be 
made by other students in the 
form of feature articles and there 
will be a portion of the paper de­
voted to the social activities of 
the dorm residents.
There will be another short 
meeting Thursday at 7 p. m. in 
the Union of all of those who 
were present at the meeting last 
Thursday.
Red Cross Drive 
Reaches MiddPoint
The 1946 Red Cross Fund cam­
paign reached the half way mark 
last Friday. Slow but steady 
progress has been reported 
throughout Allegheny County. 
Exact figures as to the progress of 
the drive here at C.I.T. are not 
available. From the display of 
Red Cross flags being worn by the 
students, it is a good guess that 
C.I.T. is doing its part and that 
we have not forgotten the peace­
time role of the Red Cross. If you 
have not yet made your donation, 
do not wait for the Mortar Board 
solicitors to approach you. Go to 
the Cashier’s Office and help C.I.T. 
make a good showing in this drive.
Tri-Delts Hold Tea
T r i - Delts, National Women’s 
fraternity, gave a tea on Sunday, 
March 17, for their alumnae and 
for the presidents of all other 
women’s fraternities on campus.
The purpose of the affair was 
to create good fellowship among 
the women’s fraternities. From the 
looks of the crowd which attend­
ed, the tea was quite successful.

By B. J. Kreimer
Well, we’ve been talking and 
talking about spring and now its 
here (perhaps we’re pessimistic, 
but we’ve got our fingers crossed). 
With Spring, the campus comes to 
life and we look forward to such 
things as the Beaux Arts Ball and 
Spring Carnival.
The D. G.’s celebrated Found­
ers’ Day Friday, March 15, with 
a banquet at the University Club 
which was followed by a semi- 
formal dance.
Before the Soph Hop Saturday, 
the S. A. E.’s had a cocktail party 
for their dates at the house.
Sunday afternoon the Tri Delts 
gave a Tea at the Union for their 
alumnae, advisors, and the Prési­
dents of the various sororities on 
campus.
In the forgotten souls depart­
ment we have the Phi Kapps who 
gave a Tea Dance Tuesday, March 
12, at the house. They had a huge 
cake with Chi Omega written on 
it in honor of their guests. Friday 
night the Phi Kapps had a house 
dance.
Also in the forgotten depart­
ment, the Tau Delts had a stag 
party last Saturday night.
After the Soph Hop, the Tau 
Delts went “en masse” to The 
Cottage, a small road house on 
Saw Mill Run Blvd. where they 
literally took over the joint.
The Kappas were aides at an 
Alumnae Bridge Saturday after­
noon at the Schenley Hotel.
Friday night the Delts had a 
house party and before the dance 
Saturday they had a dinner for 
the brothers and their dates.
The Theta’s elected officers at 
their last meeting. They are Pres­
ident, Mary Jane Horridge; Vice 
President, Joanne Hipp; Treasur­
er, Jean Boltey; and Correspond­
ing Secretary, Janet Murray. Con­
gratulations.
Monday the Pitt and Tech 
Theta’s will gather at the Pitt 
house to meet the new district pres­
ident, Mrs. Carlisle. She will visit 
the Tech campus some time during 
the week.
Friday night found the Chi O’s 
attending a street car party. The 
car left from the cut at 8:30. All 
the girls packed box lunches for
their dates and the sorority sup­
plied cokes. The car took the 
Washington route through Mt. 
Lebanon and passed through 
downtown. In the way of enter­
tainment, the girls had a portable 
radio, and they sang Chi O songs. 
Mr. and Mrs. Igo acted as chaper­
ons. Naturally a good time was 
had by all.
Tech Drama Dept. 
One of the Rest
Since the Carnegie Tech drama 
school is one of the best and the 
best known drama schools in the 
country we feel that you on cam­
pus who are always making jokes 
about the poor dramats might like 
to learn something about this de­
partment.
The Tech Drama Department 
was one of the first schools to con­
fer the Bachelor of Arts degree in 
Dramatic Art. Students in this 
department normally total approx­
imately 120 but now exceed this 
number considerably, including the 
Evening School students and the 
graduate students. For the first 
and second years, the schedules 
are generally the same. At the 
beginning of the Junior year, an 
option in Acting, Play-writing, 
Producing, or Directing must be 
named and followed to completion.
Units are given for rehearsals, 
productions, and actual work in 
the presentation of the plays. It 
is through this practice that the 
necessary experience in the spe­
cific option is obtained. A studio 
theatre is located in the rear of 
the Skibo and it is in this theatre 
that many of the students acquire 
their proficient technique.
An average of one play each 
month is presented in the “Little 
Theatre” by these students. The 
“Merchant of Yonkers” is the cur­
rent production commencing 
March 12. There will be eight 
performances. The play for April 
will be “Dona Rosita,” a poetic 
comedy; and for May, a Gilbert 
and Sullivan operetta entitled 
“Trial by Jury.”

News From 
Here & There
The students at the University 
of Texas have formed an Air Co­
op Service, with shares to finance 
it being sold among the student 
body at $100 each. It’s members, 
mostly Air Corps Veterans, but 
including a few faculty members, 
will receive the benefits of low 
cost flying, pilot instruction, char­
ter service, and ground crew 
training. The profits, if any, will 
be distributed to stock holders. 
Three small Taylor Craft planes 
will comprise the co-op’s original 
equipment with more to be added 
later.
The Hoya of the University of 
Georgetown does a little lobbying 
in its current issue for the new 
exchange student bills before Con­
gress. The American soldier, en­
gaged in the decidedly unsocial 
business of war and seeing the 
peoples of neighboring countries 
at their worst, built up a vast res­
ervoir of hatred for the peoples 
of foreign countries and came 
home with nothing that could be 
mistaken for love for these peo­
ple. This paper expresses the hope 
that the Bloom Bill, which would 
extend exchange scholarships to 
Europeans similar to those now 
given to Latin Americans, and 
the Fulbright Bill, which proposes 
to liquidate our assets abroad by 
exchanging them for foreign uni­
versity scholarships for American 
students, will be approved by 
Congress. They would do much to 
alleviate these war inspired mis­
understandings which are threat­
ening world peace.
Bold face announcement on the 
top of the front page of the Grove 
City Collegian: “Delinquent Re­
ports on March 12.” The editor ap­
parently believes in letting his 
readers have it straight.
Too Sad Department: 176 prom­
inent American educators and 
professional men of German and 
Austrian extraction have asked 
President Truman to formulate 
and implement immediate plans 
for the relief of starvation condi­
tions in Germany and Austria. 
They state that to attempt to con­
vert Germany into a harmless ag­
ricultural nation would result in 
the necessity of feeding and polic­
ing the Germans or allowing them 
to starve to death. Widespread 
devastation, loss of agricultural 
areas, and an influx of refugees 
have converted these countries in­
to “a vast derelict, human slum.” 
Six prominent University of Chi­
cago faculty members, including 
Chancellor Hutchins, and Man­
hattan Project expert -Dr. Harold 
C. Urey, are supporting this.
Fraternity men will be happy 
to know that someone has finally 
praised them as a force for good. 
Dr. Wilbur N. Cramblet, president 
of Bethany , W. Va., College, 
opines that the college fraternity 
has become an integral part of the 
educational system. They have 
ceased worrying so much about 
the operation of rooming houses, 
a heavy social schedule, and the
ginning practice. The coach saw 
a face he didn’t recognize and in­
quired the player’s name. “Scan- 
agjorvizuschinwitz,” sir,” was the 
answer. The mentor turned to 
his assistants and said, “put him 
on the first team, boys.”
I’d sure like to see the news­
reels of the Bowling Green-Rhode 
Island State ball game in Madison 
Square Garden the other night 
just to see that shot of Caverly’s. 
The Islanders trailed by two 
points with just seconds remain­
ing when the sharp-shooting for­
ward comes up with a 55-foot 
heave that drops through the hoop 
to send the game into overtime. 
R. I. finally came out on the long 
end of a 82-79 score, a new high 
for total points scored in a Gar­
den game.
“Sporty” Wiernacz seems to 
have but one joke in his reper­
toire these days. When one meets 
him anywhere, the Welch pride 
and joy almost invariably comes 
up with, “Can I have an ice-cream 
cone, daddy?” “Shut up and drink 
your beer!” “But, daddy — ” 
“Shup up and wipe the foam off 
your mouth”
And then there was Mike Evans 
who came to the conclusion that, 
no matter what kind of society 
we have, people are essential.
They tell me they need three 
more lines so I’ll gas off (like a 
friend of mine always does). 
Joke! “Who was that lady I seen 
you with last night?” “That was 
no lady. That was my brother. He 
just walks that way.”
Clarence Overend, Director of 
Athletics, has announced the Car­
negie Tech football schedule for 
the coming year. Bill Donohoe’s 
charges will face a seven-game 
schedule, beginning October 12 
and terminating November 23. 
Move Over, Frankie 
At the same time, Mr. Overend 
announced that the Tartans would 
play their home games at Forbes 
Field during 1946. Bill Benswan- 
ger’s back yard will be no strange
battling for campus honors and 
fancied prestige. Today, college 
executives endorse the fraternity 
system and request their coopera«- 
tion in the school’s affairs. “The 
recognition of the obligation of 
the group in the total life of the 
college will bring new opportuni­
ties to the American college fra­
ternity,” concludes Dr. Cramblet.
W.A.A. Girls •

This Thursday evening, the 
W. A. A. basketball team plays 
the P. C. W. team in the Women’s 
Gym at 8 o’clock. Arrangements 
are being made for a game with 
Duquesne to be played in the near 
future. The basketball season will 
close with this match and will 
shortly be replaced by outdoor 
sports.
Reminder to W. A. A. girls ex­
pecting awards: Hand in your 
names with the numbers of points 
and hours already earned. This 
is necessary in order to distribute 
the honors due.

thing is done in a hurry. The 
last attempt is being made to

The absence of last week’s 
round-up did not indicate a lack 
of intramural news, but rather an 
unscheduled vacation on the part 
of the intramural reporter. The 
last two weeks have seen plenty 
of action with bowling more than 
half over and basketball in the 
play-off stage.
The Beta’s, paced by the fast 
scoring team of Frank and Grab, 
walked away with the League II 
basketball title by dropping the 
Tau Delts and SAE’s in one-two 
order. The SAE’s found all hopes 
for a league championship lost 
when the Beta’s turned on the 
heat in the final game of the sea­
son to win 39-23.
Other games in the same league 
saw the Tau Delts whip class 
section 7-B 35-24, and the Delts 
slaughter the Dorm Combine 
61-22. Bob Harlow was the big 
gun for the Delts as he rang the 
bell with 18 field goals and a cou­
ple of fouls for the season’s high 
score of 38 points.
League I was a mess. In the 
first place, an Intramural Board 
ruling cost the Phi Kaps every 
game they had won while using 
an ineligible man. With the Phi 
Kaps knocked from the top of 
the column to a berth on the 
level of the P.B.A. it turned into 
a wide open race for the play-off 
with the Beta’s. But with a vic­
tory over the T.N.T.’s to their 
credit the PiKA’s looked like the 
best bet on the floor.
The TX’s were the team that 
upset the PiKA applecart. In 
tightest battle of the season the 
PiKA’s found themselves on the 
short end of a 39-38 score and 
on a par with-both the TX’s and 
T.N.T.’s for first place. Nettleton 
led the TX attack with fifteen 
points while Armour, the PiKA’s 
wonder boy, chalked up an even 
20.
It took a sharp-shooter named 
Katselas to set the league back 
in order again. With 21 points 
in one game and 25 in another he 
paced the T.N.T.’s into the post 
season play-off with the PiKA’s 
and a chance to meet the Beta’s in 
tonight’s Championship Game. 
The T.N.T. victims were the Phi 
Kaps to the tune of 51-20 and 
the TX’s by a decisive 57-17 
count.
The remaining games showed 
the independent P.B.A.’s dropping 
four in a row on forfeits to the 
PiKA’s, T.N.T.’s, and Phi Kaps, 
and Scobell Hall, Scobell nosing 
out the TX’s 27-25 after losing to 
the DU’s in a 33-26 ballgame, and 
the PiKA’s using Armour’s 18 
points to beat the DU’s 38-30.

After an off-week the Craig St. 
Alleys were busy again as the 
twelve teams continued to battle 
for the Intramural Bowling tro­
phy. SAE with the help of the 
DU’s overtook Scobell Hall in 
League I, while the Beta Sigs 
continued to enjoy their su­
premacy in the other half of the 
competition. With one week of 
bowling left it looks likely that 
the SAE’s and Scobell will have 
to meet in a post-season match 
as only the upset of the season 
would cause either team to drop 
even one of next week’s games.
The Beta Sigs made a clean 
sweep of the PiKA’s and added 
three more points in their win 
column, while elsewhere in the 
same league the TX’s took two 
out of three from Welch Hall, and 
the Delts made a similar show­
ing against the Citcom Clan. In
League I the SAE’s captured 
three from the Phi Kaps, the Tau 
Delts whitewashed the Zeta’s, and 
the DU’s eked out a two point 
victory from Scobell Hall to put 
the SAE’s up on an even level 
with the league leaders.

Soccer is scheduled to get un­

and the SAE’s meet the PiKA’s

A recent meeting of Intramural 
Managers Club resulted in a de­
cision to rewrite the organiza­
tion’s constitution and the elec­
tion of the following officers: 
President—A1 Schindler, Vice- 
President—Dave Berry, Secre­
tary—Ken Whitmoyer.
“C” Club Plans 
Reorganization
Several of the lettermen of Car­
negie Tech are interested in reor­
ganizing the old “C” Club which 
was reduced to nothing by the 
lack of sports at Tech during the 
war. Chief among the functions 
of the club are helping with pep 
rallys, and in general, creating 
and promoting interest in all the 
interschool sports in which Tech 
is active. The club will be effec­
tive in publicizing the football 
team and will conduct the rallies 
preceding each game. This should 
help dissipate the general 
langour of the Tech students 
which has been overly evident 
during the present school year.
In order to determine how 
many men are interested in join­
ing such an organization, Cloyd 
Mellott has arranged a meeting of 
all the lettermen in room 106 of 
the Fine Arts Building at 4:30 
P. M., Thursday, March 21. If suf­
ficient interest is shown, these 
men will plan a Spring Banquet. 
This was formerly another of the 
functions of the organization and 
was always well attended. Ath­
letic Director Clarence Overend 
is in full support of this move­
ment and is attempting to find the 
old constitution of the old club to 
provide a basis for the reorgan­
ization of the club.

Council History
[continued from page I] 
for the expenditure and account­
ing of the fund obtained from the 
fifteen dollar activity fee which 
each student paid, the setting up 
of the annual calendar for social 
events, the supervision of fresh­
man regulations, and similar du­
ties which can be administered 
with more harmony and effective­
ness by a responsible student 
group than by any faculty com­
mittee. With the fund secured 
from the activity fee, Council 
made annual appropriations to 
campus organizations and assum­
ed profits or deficits if the budget 
of the group was not in harmony 
with its expenses.
In approving the constitution of 
the Council in 1923, the Adminis­
tration reserved the right to re­
view, and to annul if necessary, 
any action taken by the Council 
that, in the judgment of the Exe­
cutive Board, was not in accord 
with the best interests of the in­
stitution. That no such reversal 
had yet taken place in 1935 is an 
interesting commentary on the 
quality of student government 
than can be secured when fac­
ulty and undergraduates work to­
gether understandingly.
When the Council was first or­
ganized, however, its work lagged 
at the beginning of each college 
year because of the turn-over in 
its personnel, those familiar with 
its policies and machinery having 
graduated the preceding June. 
This, and other weaknesses large­
ly due to the annual change in 
student officers were corrected in 
1926 by the appointment of an ex­
ecutive secretary who was to 
serve on a long term basis. How­
ever, this office was suspended 
in 1940.
The war led to a major change 
in Student Council. In May of 
1943, the control of all student 
campus activities not of intercol­
legiate nature was given over to 
the Army Civilian Activities Com­
mittee (A. C. A. C.). The under­
standing was that it should cease 
to function when C.I.T. resumed 
formal operation on a pre-war 
basis. 3*31
Thus in June, 1945, Student 
Council again became the gov­
erning body. It is now made up of 
one voting member from each col­
lege for every one hundred full­
time undergraduate students en­
rolled in that college. There are 
also two assistant secretaries 
from Margaret Morrison, one rep­
resentative from the College of 
Engineering, and one representa­
tive from the College of Fine Arts 
(all non-voting).
The present Student Council 
has control and jurisdiction over 
all student organizations in Tech 
and all extra-curricular, non- 
athletic student activities. It rec­
ommends to the Executive Board 
each year its detailed annual 
budget, supervises all drives for 
funds for special purposes, auth­
orizes all student social functions 
and rallies held in the Gym­
nasium and in Thistle Hall, and 
fosters school spirit, customs, and 
traditions.
This year Student Council has 
been extremely active. Not only 
has it reinstated freshman regula- 
ut it revised the men’s 
stem. Its various commit- 
e succeeded in re-estab- 
he tea dance and the stag 
11 dances held in pre- 
s. It has held freshman 
mixers to permit the students to 
get acquainted and such large an­
nual dances as the Winter Carni­
val (Sno-BaU) and the Autumn 
Frolic. All in all, Student Coun­
cil has done a wonderful job and 
should be regarded by the stu­
dents and the faculty as an effi­
cient, responsible body.

Chemical Engineering students 
can look forward to additions and 
changes in their field of study here 
at C.I.T. These changes will come 
from wartime developments in the 
production of synthetic rubber, 
aviation gasoline, and the extrac­
tion of U-235 and plutonium. 
Doctors McCabe and Monrad con­
tributed to the research work in 
the chemical treatment of charcoal 
for gasmask canisters and the de­
velopment of synthetic rubber re­
spectively. The Pittsburgh Press 
will soon run articles covering the 
contributions of the C.I.T. faculty 
and graduates to wartime re­
search. Graduate students will 
soon have better facilities as Dr. 
Bruel’s laboratory has been turned 
over to the Chemical Engineering 
Department.

Chester Biscup 
Pres, of Eve. 
Student Council
Performing his duties as Presi­
dent of Evening Student Council 
is only one of the many versatili­
ties of Chester J. Biscup. From 
the very first year of his registra­
tion in the evening courses at 
Tech, he has taken an active part 
in all of the extra-curricular ac­
tivities. His early years were
spent in the College of Industries 
where he was pursuing a course in 
Electrical Equipment and Con­
struction under Professor Ashe. 
He finished this course and then 
decided to continue along the lines 
of Electrical Engineering, and so 
registered for more subjects on the 
campus. While taking part in 
these various extra-curricular ac­
tivities, Chet was honored by his 
election to various student offices 
consisting of President of Indus­
tries, President of Engineering, 
Secretary of Student Council, and 
his present position as President 
of Evening Student Council. He 
was also awarded the' scholarship 
of the Evening College of Indus­
tries.
Chet is a member of three fra­
ternities on the campus. He is a 
member of Pi Delta Epsilon, Past- 
president of Nu Sigma Alpha, and 
a charter member and first Presi­
dent of Sigma Delta Phi. He was 
elected President of Evening Stu­
dent Council in 1944; and since he 
handled the job so capably, it was 
only natural that he should be re­
elected in 1945. It was under his 
leadership and guidance that the 
old constitution was revised and 
modernized to form our present 
constitution.
We are fortunate that Chet de­
cided to leave his home town of 
Buffalo, N. Y.; because it was 
definitely our gain when he came 
to Pittsburgh and Carnegie Tech. 
He still holds some allegiance to 
Buffalo and is always glad to ex­
pound by the hour on its many 
merits; but deep in his heart, he 
must admit that Pittsburgh has 
its good points. Chet is a likable 
fellow who always greets you with 
a cheerful smile that brings lights 
to his blue eyes. His pleasant per­
sonality and his ability to get 
along with people account for his 
many friends.
Banquet Tickets
Tickets are now on sale for the 
Engineers’ Banquet to be held in 
the Roosevelt Hotel, April 27. Full 
course dinner, entertainment, 
souvenirs, what more could you 
want for $3.00? Additional tickets 
may be obtained from Frank 
Mihelich and Mr. McKelway. Be 
sure and obtain yours early be­
cause they go like hotcakes. This 
is really the affair of the year. 
(The engineers tell us.) And may­
be you will win the door prize. I 
wonder if they give away one of 
those lovely entertainers as this 
prize. Don’t forget to see Frank 
or Mr. McKelway for that ticket.

When a friend recently retorted, 
“Well, of what good is the OPA, 
anyway?”, I was nonplussed for 
an answer. The more I thought it 
over, the more deeply was I con­
fused. So I took my problem 
home and gave it some deep 
thought. The next day, while 
walking up Fifth Avenue, looking 
into windows but seeing nothing,
I bumped smack into a beautiful 
blonde. I was so startled that I 
almost forgot to excuse myself. 
And, then, believe it or not, right 
there in front of a ladies’ dress 
shop window, the answer dawned 
upon me.
I looked not at the blonde but 
into the window wherein there 
was on display a lovely, scanty, 
two-piece lady’s bathing attire. 
My mind raced back a few years 
to the time when I was positive 
that they surely could not abbre­
viate the suits anymore and still 
be within the law. And then my 
mind shifted to the OPA. Now I 
was beginning to see the light 
shining far down at the end of 
that long, narrow, dark corridor; 
my mind went racing up into that 
dark shaft striving towards the 
light. And like a starshell burst­
ing overhead, the answer came. 
If there were no OPA, there would 
be no ceiling prices on any com­
mercial article, including clothing 
materials. And if the prices on 
bathing suit material were to go 
sky high, where do you think the 
ladies’ bathing suits would go? 
The manufacturers simply could 
not afford to put as much material 
into the bathing suits and where 
would that leave us?
Perhaps we should feel con­
tented that the OPA restricts only 
the ceiling prices of the suit and 
leaves the rest to the ladies’ 
whims. As one wag put it, “The 
women—paradoxical as it seems— 
pay more and more to wear less 
and less in order to show more 
and more.
Eve. Students’ Letter 
To the Plaid Editor
Dear Editor:
It was with shock and disap­
pointment that we read your arti­
cle notifying evening school stu­
dents of the abrupt end of our so­
cial activities here at Tech. Al­
though we realize that our attend­
ance has been poor, we hereby 
plead for another'chance.
Defense No. 1—The past social 
activities have been unsuccessful 
mainly because of unpleasant 
weather. - Therefore students 
found it difficult to “get here.” 
Now that spring is on its way and 
“a young man’s fancy turns to 
thoughts of love” is reason enough 
to assume that the Tech lads and 
lassies would naturally look for­
ward to social events.
Defense No. 2—Why, oh why! 
must all the activities be on that 
precious Saturday evening? There 
are six other nights in the week, 
five of them school nights. An­
other suggestion here is to have 
some informal gathering or hop 
at a reasonable time on the night 
which the most classes meet. This 
will eliminate unnecessary travel­
ing to and from the campus. After 
going through the grind at class, 
a refreshing coke followed by the 
limbering of the muscles in a 
tango would be just the ticket. Is 
there any way in which we could 
use the Evening School study room 
as a source of publicity for Eve­
ning School events? Is it possi­
ble to have some representative 
make the rounds of all classes an­
nouncing parties, etc? Wouldn’t 
this instill new interest?
Aw, c’mon, Ed! How about it? 
We’ll try! Just you wait and see. 
Just give us another chance . . . 
how about a dance?
A discontented group,
Yoo Hoo! you back there. Come 
out from behind that 8 Ball and 
roll out with the dirt. We is just 
dyin’ to hear from ya! You’re the 
only one who can keep us jivin’ 
hepcats hittin’ on all cylinders. 
What’s that? You say the latest 
nick-name of a famous P. & D. 
student is “Gravel Gertie”? They 
can’t do that. Perk up, Gert! 
Things can’t be that bad. Made a 
new acquaintance since I last ap­
peared before you Co-Eds and 
Collegiates ... his name is A1 
. . . That’s all you have to know. 
If this has aroused any interest, 
drop in on Intro. Psych, class some 
Friday nite and say, “Joe sent me” 
. . . EXIT!!! Before I get kicked 
out, would like to mention I saw 
Rosemary strolling down the 
“Cut” with him . . . Why didn’t 
somebody tell me this column was 
censored? The Ed. certainly gives 
this write-up the onceover . . . 
To get down to business, Lee, 
“The Oreat Primavera” certainly 
keeps a certain class supplied with 
Life Savers. Wonder what the 
subtle mood behind .her actions 
could be? . . . Anybody know 
where I can 'pick Up J. Mercer’s 
interpretation of “Personality”? 
That’s as hard to get as butter is 
scarce. Incidentally, if you get 
jelly with your bread in the Skibo, 
don’t ask any questions! The less 
said the better . . . Just where 
has Betty Cohi£y.,been hiding her­
self lately? Ttiis goes for Olive 
Baumgardner too . . . Hm! Wish 
I could find out his name . . . 
you know who? The tall black­
haired, good-looking fellow who 
sits across from me in the library 
every Friday night? If you de­
cide to disclose this heavily guard­
ed secret, address the 8-Ball editor 
care of this paper . . . Hm! this 
may prove to be interesting . . . 
Guess what the wind blew in! 
Fred Vichich . . . none other.
Haven’t seen him since the Johns­
town Flood. Let’s see! I’m sure 
it was close to the turn of the cen­
tury. The Gay nineties would be 
more like it, wouldn’t it, Fred old 
man? . . . Better wind this up 
now while I can still walk out of 
here alive.
Dr. Johnston 
New Tech Prof.
One of the newest additions to 
the roster of C.I.T.’s Evening 
School instructors is Dr. William 
Johnston who teaches E81 A & B 
every Friday evening. Dr. John­
ston had no definite plans to teach 
at Tech until he came here one 
evening with a friend who was
registering for evening classes. 
While his friend was enrolling, 
Bill (as he likes to be called) 
talked with "Professor Prine and 
asked him to put his name on the 
list of possible instructors in the 
Evening School. Not long after 
this meeting Dr. Johnston was of­
fered a position teaching one night 
a week. He accepted the offer and 
now claims there is nothing like 
teaching and wouldn’t give it up 
for anything.
Dr. Johnston took his under­
graduate work at Davidson Col­
lege, North Carolina, where he 
majored in Mathematics, Physics, 
and Chemistry. He was a mem­
ber of the college football team 
and enjoyed the work so much 
that he planned to coach when lie 
finished college. As a member of 
the All-Southern Team in 1939, he 
left an impressive record behind at 
Davidson with his football abili­
ties. It wasn’t until he was 
awarded a Du Pont Fellowship 
that his present career as physicist 
took precedence over coaching. 
From Davidson he went to the 
University of Virginia to finish 
work on his doctor’s degree and 
teach physics for three yeafs.
While attending Davidson, Bill 
and his brother were very ambi­
tious and they had many and nu­
merous plots for making money so 
as to defray the expenses of col­
lege life. They sold radios, acted 
as agents for the sale.of tailor- 
made clothes, operated a boarding­
house, sold flowers for college 
dances, and basketball equipment 
to fraternities. During the sum­
mer, they conducted a Swap Shop. 
This shop was operated on the 
basis that they would buy any ar­
ticle their clients didn’t want at 
the owner’s price and then resell 
it. The articles were resold at a 
cost plus 10% so as to make a 
little profit. Both of them joking­
ly insist that the government got 
the idea from their Swap Shop.
Dr. Johnston’s father was a 
Presbyterian Minister at Leesburg, 
Florida. In his father’s church he 
sang in the choir and played the 
organ, a forerunner of his hobby 
of collecting classical records and 
enthusiasm for the symphony. 
Along the more strenuous lines, he 
likes to ski. He claims skiing on 
one ski (quite by accident, of 
course) is no easy task and was 
amazed when he survived with no 
broken bones. Accidents in sports 
seem to follow him as he tells the 
story of how he and a friend were 
in a paddle boat on the Mononga- 
hela River. The boat overturned 
and it required an hour to reach 
the shore. *
Even though his home was in 
Florida, he is no stranger to Pitts­
burgh. His mother’s home was in 
Wilkinsburg, and his grandfather 
managed a brick and stone quarry 
here. In 1922 he visited relations 
in Pittsburgh for about a year, 
and really likes the city, he says. 
The one thing he does miss most, 
though, is the Florida sun.
Dr. Johnston liked his high- 
school days and the activities 
which accompanied campus at­
tendance. He was editor of the 
school paper and dirt column, and 
he won the State Championship 
when he wrote 80 words a minute.

8THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MARCH 19, 1946
Critical TemperatureBeaux Arts
The Merchant of Yonkers is one 
of those plays that you will either 
like very much, or not care for at 
all. We personally incline to the 
former opinion — we loved it! 
After thinking it over carefully 
we have come to the conclusion 
that we enjoyed this show more 
than any other for a long time— 
Fashion in fact. Such a sweeping 
statement makes it imperative to 
add that we are thinking of it 
from the standpoint of pure en­
joyment; some other shows, es­
pecially As You Like It, were bet­
ter as all-round productions, but 
while they were enjoyable too, it 
was in a different way than The 
Merchant of Yoi\kers.
The comparison with Fashion is 
obvious, and undoubtedly suggest­
ed itself to everyone who saw 
both plays. There is a superficial 
resemblance in spirit and in pace 
(and several of the actors were 
in both shows), but also a funda­
mental difference: whereas Fash­
ion w as a satire on the problems 
of the day, The Merchant of Yon­
kers is concerned with universal 
problems, and makes its point 
without satire. Mr. Wilder mixes 
moralizing with just plain fun so 
skillfully that you find them 
equally delightful. His dialogue is 
dotted with adorable little epi­
grams (“Money’s like manure, 
which isn’t worth anything until 
it’s spread about encouraging 
young things to grow.” “Every­
body would eavesdrop once in a 
while, I always say. There’s noth­
ing like eavesdropping to show 
you that the world outside your 
head is different from the world 
inside your head.”) and at least 
once in every act one of the char­
acters takes time out to give the 
audience some good advice. These 
philosophical homilies present food 
for thought, but they are given in 
such an engaging manner that one 
does not have the feeling of being 
preached at.
The actual story of the play is 
interesting, but occasionally a lit­
tle silly or far-fetched. It is con­
cerned with a rich merchant, his 
niece, his clerks, and a striking 
woman who was a friend of his 
late wife. All of them go to New 
York separately, the merchant to 
seek a bride, the niece to marry 
an artist of whom her uncle dis­
approves, the clerks for some ad­
venture, and the friend to “ar­
range” things. Complications arise 
when the clerks, who are in New 
York without permission anyhow, 
accidentally meet the merchant’s 
intended, and one of them falls 
in love with her. From this point 
on, glorious confusion reigns, com­
plete with mistaken identity and 
several cases of intoxication. The 
outcome is apparent quite early in 
the play, but it really makes no 
difference, as the plot is merely 
the framework on which Mr. 
Wilder drapes the more important 
elements of his play—philosophy, 
humor, and character analyses.
We liked the play so much that 
we thought it a privilege rather 
than a task to see both casts. We 
have often felt that it was unfair 
to mention only one cast in our 
reviews, but what with deadlines 
and all it has seldom been possi­
ble to see both casts before writ­
ing our column of opinion. Now 
we have no such excuse, and we 
find how difficult it is to evaluate 
different interpretations of the 
same role, either by themselves or 
in comparison. One cannot help 
feeling slightly prejudiced against 
the second cast one sees (unless 
the actors strive to be identical, 
which is not particularly desira­
ble), for the first cast has already 
fixed its own interpretation of the 
characters in one’s mind. We 
shall, however, try to be as fair 
as we can.
Correction
Richard Emerson Williams’ 
name was unfortunately omitted 
in the February 26 article Asso­
ciated Artists Exhibit Awards 
Many Techites Prizes. Williams 
won a top money prize of $400 — 
the Harvey Gaul Prize.
The name of Dorothy King, 
who did What Does It Profit 
Man, wai also omitted.
On the whole, the acting in 
both casts, in major and minor 
parts alike, was very, very good. 
There were differences of inter­
pretation in almost all parts, and 
in most cases we thought them 
equally good, but in a few in­
stances one seemed to us more 
what the author intended than the 
other. The players who were 
single-cast were extremely good. 
We think everyone will agree 
with us that our colleague Boyd 
Stine (“Casey”), in a part that 
seemed written especially for him, 
unquestionably stole the show. He 
romped through the part of the 
younger clerk with good humor 
and without overacting, an excel­
lent combination. Carl Betz was 
dashing as the harassed artist who 
begins to doubt whether beauty is 
a satisfactory substitute for intel­
ligence. We thought Mr. Betz was 
better the first time; by Friday 
night he seemed to be getting a 
little bored with the proceedings 
and occasionally stepped out of 
character, but when he remem­
bered, he showed that it is possi­
ble to do a lot with a role that 
might easily become stereotyped. 
In passing we must not forget 
Thomas O’Malley’s wonderful di­
alectal cabman, and Daniel Franks 
and Louis Knaak as waiters.
Together in the title role were 
Parker Meyers and Vincent 
Checco; Mr. Checco, playing with 
more restraint, seemed the more 
skillful actor, but both perform­
ances were good. Melchior Stack, 
the philosophic bum, was played 
in an entirely different spirit by 
David Crantz from that of Roger 
Brann; the gravity of the latter 
seemed to us to add more to the 
power of the. characterizations of 
this enigmatic figure than the re­
pressed mirth of the former. Mr. 
Crantz, however, put a lot more 
into the long speech in the third 
act than did Mr. Brann. The most 
memorable character in the play, 
Mrs. Levi, was excellently done 
by Ruth Guberman and Joan 
Bower. In our opinion Miss Gu- 
berman’s performance was the 
more forceful, for she played with 
greater sincerity. Perhaps in this 
case we were influenced by hav­
ing seen her fust. (The second 
time around it occurred to us what 
an excellent part this would be 
for Rita Sheinman, a graduate of 
last year, whom most of you re­
member in such plays as The Way 
of the World and The Old Maid.)
Both Wilford Thunhurst and 
Ernest Motyl made the part of the 
older clerk simple and appealing; 
the main difference in their inter­
pretations was that Mr. Motyl’s 
Cornelius was an older, more ma­
ture man than Mr. Thunhurst’s. 
We were not particularly impress­
ed with the idea of pitching 
Ermengarde’s voice so unaturally 
high; -Mary Gibson bore up under 
the strain fairly well, but it be­
came very difficult to understand 
Marie Minnemeyer. Gerry Jedd’s 
Mrs. Molloy had more of the live­
liness and pep inherent in this 
personage than did Caroline

Cook’s. Lucy Seibert enlivened her 
portrayal of Minnie Fay, the as­
sistant milliner, with a most 
amusing dialect, and it was partly 
through that that she outshone 
her double, June Shannon. Miss 
Shannon’s performance was quite 
competent, however, as were 
those of both the Misses Van Huy- 
sen, and the other actors who 
have not been mentioned.
The Merchant of Yonkers is a 
serious play; it has a “message”. 
But it is not a heavy play. There 
is a lot of simple, good humor in 
it, and it is all-in-all an enjoyable 
experience.
One Lone Girl Dramat 
Lost Amid 21 Wolves
Sirkka Tuomi, a Finnish lass in 
the Dramatic class, has to work 
all day surrounded by men. This 
she enjoys immensely because 
these 21 men are all so nice.
Sirkka was born in Minnesota 
and moved several times, by way 
of Massachusetts and Ohio, event­
ually calling Baltimore, Maryland, 
her home.
She was a student at the Pea­
body Music Conservatory’s dra­
matic department for six years. 
Acting runs in her family, for both 
her parents are active members of 
the Little Theatre of Baltimore. 
She has spent several of her sum­
mers in Summer Stock.
During the war, she served in 
the Women’s Army Corps as a 
Signal Corps stenographer, spend­
ing 18 months in England and 
France. While in Paris, she man­
aged to see Katherine Cornell and 
Brian Ahern playing in “The Bar­
retts of Wimpole Street” and also 
“Love in Idleness” with Lynn Fon­
taine and Alfred Lunt. Her trav­
els were a great pleasure to her, 
and she enjoyed the opportunity 
of meeting different people.
She is now studying acting in 
the Tech Drama Department. This 
blond-haired gray-eyed girl is the 
only girl in a section of 22 Fresh­
man Veterans in the Drama De­
partment. She really enjoys her 
work and says the boys in the sec­
tion are all really swell. That is 
the only section for her, she says.
Phi Kappa Phi 
Holds Campaign
The main project of the Car­
negie chapter of Phi Kappa Phi at 
the present time is raising money 
for the Roscoe M. Ihrig and Leo 
T. Lawler Memorial Scholarship. 
The goal of this drive, which was 
started in April, 1945, is $10,000. 
Up to this time, $5,000 has been 
raised, and the chapter hopes to 
complete its campaign by June 
30, 1946, as each dollar will bring 
Carnegie twice the amount in 1946 
under an arrangement with the 
Carnegie Corporation.
The income from the fund will 
be used for three awards for the 
Senior year; one in the College 
of Fine Arts, one in the College of 
Engineering, and one in Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College. They 
will be presented to the student 
showing greatest promise of at­
taining the ideals of Phi Kappa 
Phi in scholarship and character. 
The fund is being raised by con­
tributions from the members of 
the Carnegie chapter. Anyone who 
wishes to contribute to it should 
send their money to Miss Jeanne 
C. Hartman, secretary of the or­
ganization.
The members of Phi Kappa Phi 
are elected from the student body, 
alumnae, and faculty of Carnegie 
Tech. There are 750 members in 
the Carnegie chapter. At the
