Shown above is Captain Mike Simcic as he skirts right end in last Saturday’s 
game against Case. Simcic’s all-around play was a definite factor in the victory. 
Moving in to block on the run is Quarterback Quent Holtz.
Tartans Win Fifth Game, 
Upset Case Tech, 36-27; 
Simcic, Wilson Stand Out
Before a homecoming crowd of over 7,000 the Carnegie Tartans downed a highly 
favored Case eleven for their fifth victory of the season. The 36-27 win kept the Skibos 
undefeated record intact.
The entire CIT squad made a great showing but Nick Simcic, Fritz Wilson, Arne 
Oberg, Quent Holtz, and Walt Selavko were outstanding. Wilson caught three touch­
down passes, and Simcic caught a fourth. Ob erg smashed over for the fifth, and Gil Dissen 
kicked a field goal to round out the Tartan scoring.
VOL. 44—No. 7PITTSBURGH, PA.TUESDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1950
Dr. Richard Becker
Joins Tech Faculty 
* * *
New Physicist 
Will Be Added 
To Faculty
Dr. Richard Becker, one of the 
i world’s foremost theoretical phys­
icists, is on his way to the United 
States to join the faculty of Car­
negie, President J. C. Warner an­
nounced today.
Dr. Becker, professor of theoret­
ical physics at the University of 
Goettinger, Germany, has been 
appointed a visiting professor of 
physics at Carnegie, where he will 
take part in a program of re­
search in magnetism and low tem­
perature phenomena.
Dr. Becker is an internationally 
recognized authority in these 
fields. His book, “Ferromagnet­
ismus,” published in 1939, is one 
of the leading reference works on 
magnetism. ,
He is also known for his work 
in the fields of atomic physics, low 
temperature physics and plastic 
properties of solid bodies. During 
the last war, Dr. Becker worked 
on highly abstract problems in 
theoretical physics and did not 
take an active part in the German 
war effort.
The project on magnetism at 
Carnegie is being conducted under 
the joint sponsorship of the school, 
the U.S. Office of Naval Research, 
and several Pittsburgh industries.
Dr. Becker will also serve as a 
theoretical consultant on the pro­
gram of research in low tempera­
ture physics at Carnegie, and will 
lead a series of seminars on statis­
tical mechanics with emphasis on 
the application to low temperature 
physics.

Campus Near Normal 
After Big HC Weekend
53 Hundred Alumni And Delegates
Celebrate Carnegie’s Anniversary
By Nancy Sitler
Life on the Carnegie campus is again returning to normal after 
a strenuous, but eventful, weekend. Some 4,000 alumni and 1,300 
delegates from all parts of the continent joined with the faculty and 
students in celebrating'Carnegie’s fiftieth anniversary and its annual
alumni Homecoming. ?---------  *---------------  —;—:

office as the fourth president of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
on the first day of this activity 
packed weekend. A luncheon for 
the official delegates followed the 
inaugural ceremony.
Frosh Win Competition 
The Carnegie Day program Fri­
day afternoon featured the calls 
of seven honoraries on campus 
and recognition of other student 
honors. Highlighting this program 
was the coronation of Doris Plohr 
as freshman queen by President 
Warner. Marjorie Ruttle and Mar­
ilyn Porter were her two attend­
ants.
The new queen cheered the 
freshman team on to a 4 to 0 vic­
tory over the sophomores in a rug­
ged game of Fastern’s E’en on the 
Cut Saturday while Julie Cosen - 
tino, last year’s queen, staunchly 
stood by her team. Fastern’s E’en 
is a Scottish game similar to 
slaughter ball in which both teams 
strive to push a big ball over a line 
from opposite sides.
Included in the activities of 
Homecoming was the dedication of 
two new structures on campus. 
One was the major addition onto 
Engineering and Science Hall, and 
the othter was a dining and recrea­
tion wii\g onto the school’s seven- 
story, 1.8 million dollar women’s 
dormitory.
DU’s Triumph 
Delta Upsilon triumphed over 
other fraternity pledges in the 
pledge cheer competition at the 
huge pep rally last Friday night. 
The DU’s gave the winning cheer 
at the football game after receiv­
ing the award at the half.
The cup for the best Home­
coming decoration went to the Al­
pha Xau Omega fraternity. Delta 
Upsilon copped second prize. The 
winning decoration consisted of a 
chorus line of six girls dancing on 
a stage. The display was titled the 
“Golden Follies.”
In addition to inspecting the 
various departmental open houses 
and Morewood Gardens, the pub- 
| lie got its first look at a new pe- 
, troleum research laboratory estab-

Pan-Hel Dance
The Pan Hellenic dance will 
be held on November 18 in 
the Schenley hotel ballroom. 
The formal affair is held an­
nually for the benefit of the 
Pan Hellenic scholarship fund. 
Jane Connor, president of Pan 
Hel, and Hilda Chotinner, 
dance chairman, have an­
nounced that music will be 
provided by Frankie Marvin. 
Tickets are $2.50, and it is re­
quested that there be no 
flowers.
Variety Show Starts 
Solicitation Campaign 
For Worthy Charities
After many weeks of planning, 
Carnegie Tech’s Campus Chest is 
ready to roll. Opening with a var­
iety show in the Little Theater at 
11:30 today, the Chest will con­
tinue the campaign for the $4500 
student goal on November 1, 2, 
and 3.
Despite many difficulties in the 
plans for the show, the Chest 
Committee pulled a few aces out | 
of the hole to make an entertain- j 
ing 45 minutes. Dramat Jerry Ter- j 
heyden will MC the show.
Starke Drischell and Peggy Duff 
will add their inimitable touches 
to the program. Phil Flad’s magic 
act and Ralph Drischell and Regis 
Cejrowski's comedy wrestling skit j 
will amaze and amuse the audi- j 
ence. As no CIT show is complete ; 
without the pipers, they’ll also be 
on hand.
Solicitations will be made some- ; 
what differently from last year, j 
Those living in the dorms, More- 1 
wood, and in the fraternities will 
be contacted on Monday and Tues­
day nights. On Wednesday, Thurs- \ 
day, and Friday, the commuters j 
will be contacted at the beginning ; 
of the lecture classes. Those pre- i 
viously solicited will not have to 1 
fill out envelopes.
Give once and give for all in 
the only charity campaign of the 
year. Let’s put our quota “over 
the top.”
Fumbled Opener
The Skibos got off to a bad start 
as they fumbled the opening kick- 
off on their own 35. An exchange 
of punts followed before the Rid­
ers rolled to four consecutive first 
downs and a score, Don Zalimeni 
doing the honors. The extra point 
was no good.
Within three minutes, however, 
the Plaid took the lead. A pass 
netted a first down; then Simcic 
took a flip-out from Holtz and 
passed 50 yards to Fritz Wilson 
for the initial Carnegie score, and 
Dissen put his team ahead, 7-6, 
by making the extra point.
Theiling intercepted a pass to 
set up the second tally for Case. 
On the first play of the second 
quarter Zalimen scored his sec­
ond TD on a pass, putting the vis­
itors ahead 13-7.

Carnegie Day Events 
Paced By Coronation
“It will be a greater weekend than ever before; Carnegie Day 
is only the beginning!” Bill Dorn, master of ceremonies, announced 
at Carnegie Day on Friday afternoon.
From the minute when the Kiltie Band sounded the “Wings of
Victory March until the balloons*listed in the Carnegie Day pro-March until the 
floated to the floor of the gym­
nasium, the program moved swift­
ly.
Queen Coronation
The highlight of Carnegie Day 
was the coronation of the fresh­
man Homecoming queen, Doris 
Plohr. The queen’s attendants, 
Margery Ruttle and Marilyn Por­
ter, stood by as President Warner 
placed a crown of roses on Doris’ 
head.
Awards were also an important 
feature of the program. Sigma Al­
pha Epsilon won the fraternity 
scholarship cup. For the third con­
secutive year, Delta Delta Deltk 
capped the Pan Hellenic scholar­
ship, and now the sorority retains 
permanent possession of the tro­
phy.
Honoraries Call
Patricia Miller received the
1 gram.
As part of the program, seven 
i organizations called a total of 113 
! students to their ranks. Alpha Phi 
j Omega called 20 men, and Pi Delta

Editorials—
Over The Top
This week, the Campus Chest opens its annual drive 
for contributions among students and faculty at Carnegie 
Tech. Organized last year due to the conditions of charit­
able organizations coming on the campus one right after 
another to “hit” the student for funds, the Campus Chest 
is a student organization under the control of Student Coun­
cil. It makes it possible for students to give once through­
out the year and at the same time give to seven separate 
charitable organizations.
This year’s Campus Chest committee has worked long: and 
hard to determine which charities should be included, and also, 
just how much would be needed from each student to put the 
drive over the top. This year’s estimate is lower than what was 
needed last year, so students will have a chance to put their 
money to work in one thing that hasn't gone up in price.
A carton of cigarettes or one weekly trip down to the 
Greek's is very little for each student to give up once a year 
so that others, not so fortunate, may live. When the Campus 
Chest representative contacts you during the remainder of 
this week, don’t hesitate to dig down deep and help put 
this year’s drive over the top!
"(,oo<l Luck, Jake!’’
A little mite from the “Land 'O Goshen” stepped into 
the presidency of Carnegie Institute of Technology last week, 
and as one of the speakers at the Inauguration ceremonies 
so ably put it, “Everything’s Jake now.”
At the risk of paraphrasing anymore, the .Tartan would 
like to extend a warm welcome and sincere good wishes for a 
successful administration to John Cristian Warner the fourth 
president of Carnegie Institute of Technology.
If there is anything that can be predicted about Dr. War­
ner’s administration, we feel sure that it could be the al­
most certain strengthening of student-administration rela­
tionships. The new president has a commanding personality, 
and a way of dealing with people, whether students, faculty 
or administrative members, that is sure to make him a cam­
pus favorite.
A Good Sign
We hope that the recent entry of Dorm Council into the 
Homecoming Decoration competition is a sign of more spirit in 
school affairs from the dorms. Once a very powerful group, the 
Dorms have had a tough time reorganizing since the war, but 
seem to be started on the upcome one« again.
During the past few years, through frugal management, 
Dorm Council has amassed probably the largest treasury of 
any organization on campus. With 'such financial backing, 
the Dorms could probably successfully underwrite a large 
fall dance with a name band. From the petition that was 
printed in last week’s Tartan, it seems that the only thing 
necessary to make a dance go over on Carnegie’s campus 
is a name band.
Calling VAC
The opportunity really presented itSelf yesterday for a 
victory rally to honor Carnegie Tech’s undefeated team. 
The students certainly would not have been out of order 
in celebrating something that has not happened on this cam­
pus in more than two decades, that being an undefeated 
football team following homecoming. The only thing that 
the campus seems to he in dire need of now is a well-organiz­
ed group of campus leaders.

Great English Comedy 
Coming To The iNixon
Sir John Vanbrugh’s restoration 
comedy, “The Relapse, or Virtue 
in Danger”, long identified as one 
of the great comic masterpieces 
in the English language, which 
will be seen at the Nixon for one 
week only starting Monday night, 
Nov. 6, is being presented in 
Pittsburgh prior to its New York 
debut.
First produced at London’s 
Drury Lane Theatre in 1696, “The 
Relapse” had its most notable re­
vival at the Phoenix Theatre in 
London in 1948. There it ran for 
almost a year, hailed by the Lon­
don critics'as “a masterpiece of 
wit”, “a riotous and bawdy com­
edy”, “the best comedy in Lon­
don.”
That its American production 
may be noteworthy, the Theatre 
Guild has brought over star Cyril 
Ritchard and his wrife Madge El­
liott to play the roles they filled 
at the Phoenix revival; Mr. Ritch­
ard also will be director of the 
play.
Others in the cast will be John
Emery, Ruth Matteson, Murray 
; Matheson, Phillipa Nevins, and the 
Brattle Theatre Company. Albert 
Marre and Robert O’Hearn, both 
of the Brattle Theatre, serve as 
associate director, scene and cos­
tume director respectively.
The plot of “The Relapse” is con­
cerned with the outrageous phil- 
anderings of wayward wives and 
errant husbands, of ardent heir­
esses and outlandish fops. It boils 
with crooks and impersonators 
and adventurers, with distressed 
ladies caught in dalliance. It is an 
hilarious caricature of the follies, 
foibles, and manners of the gentry 
in the late 17th century in Lon­
don. /
When Richard Brinsley Sheri­
dan put the play on at the Drury 
Lane he deleted many of its more 
juicy episodes, lest he outrage the 
prudish. If one may judge from 
the Philadelphia Bulletin, which 
covered its enjoyment there last 
week and termed it “A Bawdy 
Riot” the deletions have been re­
stored.

Kiltie Band Trip To Westminster 
Getting Council Sponsorship
Aiming for increased school spirit, Carnegie Student Council 
sought at their meeting last week a means of sending the' CIT band 
to the Westminster game. Because of financial conditions a school sup­
ported trip is not planned.
However, Council will attempt*---------------------------------------------.------
to make practical a student spon- the cost supported by student con-sored journey.
Although the Issue was not 
brought to a vote, Councilmen 
seemed to favor the plan. Heavy 
expenses, amounting to over half 
of the organization’s annual al­
lotment, made the scheduling of 
the New Wilmington trip impos­
sible.
Two methods were suggested 
for the operation of the project. 
The first is the use of private au­
tomobiles to carry the band mem­
bers to the game. The other in­
volves the chartering of buses,
tributions. If it appears that either 
of these will be practical, further 
action will be taken.
A1 Moore’s suggested project to 
provide improved publicity for 
all school events has hit the skids 
financially. His proposal was the 
erection, at the end of the Cut 
and in Skibo, bulletin boards of 
the type placed at the entrance to 
the gym, which announces coming 
sports events. But since prices on 
such equipment are prohibitive, 
possibilities of a more economical 
solution will be sought.
4Y’ Schedules 
Fall Retreat
The annual fall retreat spon­
sored by the Y cabinet will be 
held this year at Cook’s Forest 
from November 10 through 12. The 
cost for the weekend, including 
meals, transportation and lodging, 
will be five dollars. See Mr. Rollin 
Davis or any YM or YWCA mem­
ber for details.
Principal speaker at the retreat 
will be Dr. Orr, head of the West­
ern Theological Seminary. He will 
discuss Phillip Wylie’s new book, 
“Opus 21.”

INQUIRING REPORTER
Campus Change Noted 
By Returning A lumni
Carnegie alumni headlined campus news during Homecoming 
weekend. People, old and not so old, dashed across the Cut in and out 
of buildings. “What did those alumni think of as they looked at 
the campus?” the inquiring reporter asked.

Carnegie Tech Upsets Case; 
Remain In Unbeaten Ranks
Roughriders Unable To Stop Plaid 
Aerial Attack In Homecoming Game
[Continued, from page 1] 
the ball on an interception by Hon. 
A pass to Zalimeni was good for 
a first down, but a 15 yard hold' 
ing penalty stalled the drive in 
its early stages. The Plaid took 
over on downs when a fourth 
down pass was not enough.
Simcic hit off tackle for 18. 
When two plays failed to make a 
first down, Holtz lateraled to Sim­
cic who passed to Wilson for the 
necessary yardage. The drive 
continued as Holtz passed to Nick 
who was tripped-up on the one. 
Oberg smashed over for the TD 
to knot the score at 13 all.
Ahead At Half 
Case could do nothing with the 
kick-off and punted. The Tartans 
also bogged down and punted; the 
receiver fumbled and Oberg re­
covered on the 48. Holtz again 
spotted Simcic and passed to Nick 
who ran the remainder of the 45 
yards for a score. Dissen's kick 
w>as good and the Tartans lead at 
halftime 20-13.
The Rough Riders took the sec­
ond half kick-off and marched 
deep into Plaid territory before 
the defense ground it to a halt, 
and the Plaid took over on downs. 
After an exchange of punts the 
ball was on the Tartan 24 with 
CIT in possession. Holtz lateraled 
to Simcic, who passed tt> Wilson 
for a 76 yard tally.
Dissen Kicks Goal 
Four pass completions enabled 
Case to drive to CIT’s two from 
where a line smash was good for 
six points, and brought the Brown 
and White to within seven points, 
27-20.
Oberg took their kick and re­
turned it 25 yards to the 47. From 
there drives by Simcic and a pass 
from Holtz to Fougere made it 
possible for Dissen to kick a 25 
yard field goal.
Behind 10 points, Case took to 
the air, but the passer was rushed 
so unmercifuly that he fumbled 
and the Plaid recovered. Oberg 
drove for two first downs to the
Skibo Runners 
Lose To Case; 
Meet Titans
Carnegie Tech’s cross country 
team lost its second meet of the 
season last Saturday morning, fall­
ing before an outstanding group 
oi runners from Case Tech, 15-40. 
The visiting Roughriders swept 
the first five places of the dual 
meet.
Although the Skibo harriers ran 
well, posting times slightly bet­ter than they did at this point in the season last year, they were no 
match for the speedsters from 
Cleveland. Tartan coach Guy Hal- 
ferty rated the Case aggregation as 
“one of tjife best teams we ever 
ran against”.
Douglas was the leading Plaid 
runner, finishing in sixth place. 
Following him across the finish 
line were Carmen, seventh, Coo­
per, eighth, Bloom, ninth, and 
Stackhouse, tenth.
In an attempt to regain the vic­
tory trail, the Tartan runners will 
entertain the Titans of Westmin­
ster this Saturday. With a present 
record of two wins and two de­
feats, the Skibos are still in a 
position to post a winning season.

4; from there Holtz passed to Wil­
son who caught the ball in the 
end zone for his tnird score.
Fumble Exchange
Case fumbled the kick-off and 
Selavko recovered; the Tartans 
immediately fumbled themselves, 
and Vickerman recovered. Cifelli 
passed for a first down, but had 
his second attempt intercepted by 
Milligan of the Plaid on his six. 
The Skibos were penalized to the 
one for holding and were forced 
to punt.
The Tartans again gained pos­
session of the ball as Pakan in­
tercepted, but were unable to move 
the pigskin and punted. The vis­
itors then began a concentrated 
aerial atack which terminated in 
a score with less than 10 seconds 
left. The final score read 36-27.
HC Victory
Carnegie Tech’s victory over 
Case last Saturday was signifi­
cant in more ways than that it 
kept the Plaid undefeated in 
five games played so far dur­
ing the 1950 season. It marked 
the first time since 1939 that 
the Tartans had defeated their 
opponent in a Carnegie home­
coming game.
In addition, for the first time 
since 1928 the Skibos have 
gone through their homecom­
ing battle and remained unde­
feated.
Carnegie nowr boasts a five 
game winning streak with 
three games remaining to be 
played. W & J, Lehigh, and 
Westminster, in that order, are 
the Skibo’s remaining foes.
In past weeks Carnegie has 
even been mentioned in the 
sportsw’riters’ compilations of 
the best teams in the country.

ATO, Delts Battle For Kiltie League Lead;
Eight Teams Play For School Championship
Several league winners were decided during last week’s intra­
mural football play. Theta Xi captured the Tartan League title by 
defeating a stubborn Beta Sigma Rho team, 23-22. The Beta Sigs 
scored 13 points in the final quarter to throw a scare into the TX six.
The Kappa Sigs virtually clinch-4—-----------------------------------------------
ed the Skibo League championship 
by defeating the Senior Chem. E's, 
47-8. Kappa 'Sigs jumped off to a 6-1 lead in the first quarter and 
were never in danger thereafter.
Delts Hold Lead 
In a Scottie League feature, the 
Phi Kaps came from behind in the 
third quarter to defeat a surpris­
ing “The Greatest” team, 31-17. 
Fleischman led the Phi Kap scor­
ing with four touchdowns, while 
Francheschi paced “The Greatest” 
with two TD’s.
The Delts remained in the run­
ning for the Kiltie League title 
by defeating the PiKA’s, 17-8. 
Bishop, Pyle, and Braun tallied 
for the Delts while Noble scored 
the single PiKA five-pointer.
“Greatest” Win First 
In other Tartan League encoun­
ters, Emanon defeated Citcom, 34-

crush the Architects, 44-4. The 
Greatest registered their first win 
of the season, as forfeit, over the 
Sad Sacks, 1-0.
In a Skibo League battle, the

The W&J-Tech football rivalry

the Prexies were on hand to make

they walloped CIT by the score oi 
34-0.

Tartan Lineman Of The Week Carnegie Tech Soccer Squad
This week the Tartan has se­
lected end Fritz Wilson as its 
Lineman of the Week, in the most 
impressive CIT victory of the cur­
rent season, Wilson scored three 
of the touchdowns and his line 
play aided in the accumulation of 
the other scores.
In the first period of the game 
Wilson made one of the most spec­
tacular catches of the year, out- 
racing the Case secondary to snag 
a Simcic pass on the-Jifteen-yard 
line for the first Skibo touchdown.
At the beginning of the second 
half, the Simcic-Wilson combina­
tion again clicked for a touch­
down that netted 76 yards.
Throughout the entire game 
Wilson was outstanding mainly on 
offense, although he played well 
on the few occasions in which he 
was in on defense.

Suffers Third Straight Loss
The Carnegie Tech soccer squad was handed its third consecu­
tive loss when the men of Slippery Rock defeated the game Skibo 
squad at the Slippery Rock field. This defeat makes the third straight 
time this season that the Tartan booters have lost by the score of 3-1.
¦ In a hard played game, Slippery 
Rock jumped off to a 1-0 first 
quarter lead on a goal by Buckey. 
In the second quarter Fred Rich­

fought back to tie the score. Dur­
ing the third quarter, however, 
the roof fell in on the Tartans as 
Giles and Guza scored the final 
goals of the game for Slippery 
Rock.

feats, Coach O’Connor still nour­
ishes hopes for a .500 season. The

New Patterns

By Kiltie Band
Carnegie Tech’s Kiltie Band* in­
augurated a novel plan to call at­
tention to the various departments 
at the school. By means of forma­
tions at all the football games, 
which in some manner describe 
the work of the departments, the 
band is pointing with pride to the 
various fields of endeavor offered 
by the school.
At this point in the season the 
band has saluted the P&D, chemi­
cal and electrical engineering de­
partments, and at the Homecom­
ing game with Case all the En­
gineering departments were hon­
ored. More formations of this 
type will be presented at future 
games.
The colorful parades which the 
Kilties present at all the football 
games form only one segment of 
the band’s activities. It played at 
the official opening of Pittsburgh’s 
Community Chest drive and is 
now preparing for their fall con­
cert.
The sale of the “Songs of Car­
negie” record albums hit a high 
peak over the Homecoming week­
end. For those Students who at 
this late date have not yet pur­
chased their album, they are still 
available at the bookstore.

Presented at Carnegie Day Exercises
Scholarship Trophy 
Awarded To Tri Delts
Cup Retained By Tri Delts Through 
Three I ear High Factor Rating
At last Friday’s Carnegie day exercises Delta Delta Delta sorority 
was presented with the Pan Hellenie Scholarship Cup for the third 
straight year. This achievement entitles them to retire the cup per­
manently.
The cup award, sponsored by the 
Pittsburgh Panhellenic Associa­
tion, was presented to the sorority 
by Miss Duella Stranahan, schol­
arship chairman of the associa­
tion.
Awarded annually to the soror­
ity with the highest factor for the 
preceding term, the cup has been 
on the Carnegie campus for only 
the past three years. Before na­
tional sororities were established 
at CIT, the award was made to 
Pitt sororities only, but recently 
the Pan Hellenic organization has 
extended a trophy to Carnegie 
also.
After being awarded the cup for 
three successive years, the win­
ning sorority may retire the cup.
Otherwise the sorority may keep 
the cup only for the current school 
year.
Term averages for the three 
highest ranking sororities for the 
past school year are as follows:
Delta Delta Delta, 2.734; Chi 
Omega, 2.682; and Alpha Epsilon 
Phi, 2.678.

AndViews For Contributions
. . . This is one Friday evening 
that the Plaid had a session even
though there wasn't any Evening 
School. The motto that now hangs 
from our Plaid office wall is, The
Editorials—
A Memorable Weekend
The past week end has been a memorable one in the 
history of Carnegie Institute of Technology, and to the 
evening students who attended the various activities it 
meant something fine; it meant their opportunity to ex­
press unbounded pride, pride in the fact that they are a 
part of a school whose entire momentum is geared forward. 
On the surface at times it appears that the evening students’ 
interests center only on the classroom, but this «is not so, 
for when the occasion arises, he too loves to show-off his 
school to his family and friends.
The evening students have not at all times in the past 
agreed entirely with the school policies, but they are not back­
wards in admitting that Carnegie Tech has maintained its 
place among the great schools of our country, and they de­
sire to help keep their school at the top. "
The evening students have always insisted that the 
various organizations on the evening school campus. Evening 
Student Council, the Plaid, the fraternities, the sorority, 
cooperate with the school’s administration in maintaining the 
principles that are synonymous with the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology.
. . . LeRoy Rowland, member of 
Evening Council, has been initi­
ated into the Silver Arrow Fra­
ternity, an Honorary Scouting 
Fraternity. LeRoy is another 
evening student who some how or 
other always finds time to do 
things for others, and still attend 
Evening School.
. . . We have just been informed 
that Cecelia Zellner, a former 
staunch Council worker, and Plaid 
Editor was recently married. Ce­
cilia is now Mrs. William Squiller, 
and we on the Plaid staff wish her 
the best of everything.
... a loyal supporter of Evening 
School Activities, Bob Hirsh, set 
a fine example again when he 
i bought ticket number one for the 
Thanksgiving Dance to be held 
Sat. evening, Nov. 25.
. . . Dick Gomrick insists that we 
petition Evening Student Council 
demanding another square dance 
immediately. He had a grand 
time at the last one and claims 
that it was the best Tech dance he 
ever attended.
. . . George Schussler and Robert 
Ellstrom former Plaid Editors, and 
George Bogovich were called by 
Pi Delta Epsilon, the National 
Journalistic Honorary at the call 
day ceremonies held as part of 
the home coming celebrations.
Drive Starts Wednesday, Nov. 1;•/
Students Take Collection In Class
An appeal to the evening students for contributions of any 
| kind, by a Campus organization, happens only once during a school 
year. This is a call for contributions to the “Campus Chest,” and is 
the evening students opportunity of helping his school realize its 
goal in community welfare con-*
tributions.
The organizers of the “Campus 
Chest” realized that since almost 
all of the evening students are 
! employed by Industry during the 
: day they already have been ap- , 
proached for contributions by . 
. their respective employers, but i 
j they also felt that the evening stu­
dents would want to contribute to 
the drive as a group.
The drive will start Wed., No- j 
verhber 1, and continue until Fri., ' 
November 3. Volunteer evening 
students will stop into your class 
rooms during these evenings and 
ask for your contributions. Please 
do not refuse them. No matter how 
small your contribution it will 
help to swell the resultant sum 
from Evening School.
Some of the groups that will re­
ceive aid from your contributions 
are: Boys clubs, Aid to the Aged, 
Community Centers, and Visiting 
Nurses. One other group which 
may interest you is the World Stu­
dent Service Fund. The money ac-
dents who are financially unable 
to continue their studies.
Thus since this is the only occa­
sion that will arise this year for 
the evening students to contribute 
as a body to a worthy cause, lets 
make our share to the drive a one 
worthy of Evening School.

It rides more smoothly
Take one ride and you'll agree Chevrolet 
is the smoothest riding car in its field. It’s 
the only low-priced car combining the 
famous Unitized Knee-Action Ride and 
airplane-type shock absorbers all around.
It drives more easily
Enjoy finest no-shift driving with Power- 
glide Automatic Transmission* and 105- 
h.p. engine—or finest standard driving 
with standard engine and Synchro-Mesh 
Transmission—at lowest cost.
It operates more economically
Chevrolet’s famous Valve-in-Head En­
gine, exclusive to Chevrolet in its price 
range, brings you an outstanding combi­
nation of thrills and thrift, plus proved 
dependability, year after year.
It lasts longer, too
Many Chevrolets are performing depend­
ably after ten, fifteen or twenty years of 
service. That's one reason why there are 
over a million more Chevrolets on the 
road than any other make.
It’s better looking all around
Outstanding good looks accompany the 
outstanding performance of Chevrolet 
cars—only low-priced car with Body by 
Fisher—and most beautiful in its field, 
according to a recent public survey.
It gives more for less throughout
Only Chevrolet offers so many perform­
ance, comfort and safety features of 
highest-priced cars at the lowest prices 
and with such low cost of operation and 
upkeep. Come in and see it nowl
*Combination of Powerglide Automatic Transmission and 105-h.p. Engine optional on De Luxe models at extra cost.
your "Best "Buy—by A// Ocfc/s
The Fleetline De Luxe 2-Door Sedcm
between the evening students and 
Council was the factor which 
made this first affair of the year 
the success that it was. Of course 
the nature of the dance to some 
extent can be accounted for the 
friendliness displayed by all the 
dancers present, but a great deal 
of credit should be given to 
genial Si Braley, who is indeed a 
master of instructing and calling 
square dance figures.
The dancers began squaring-off 
at 9:00 p. m. and in a very short 
time. Thistle Hall became a place 
of laughing and chattering 
dancers. For variety Si added a 
few of the better known folk 
dances to keep the dancers happy. 
During the occasional intermis­
sions the dancers treked to the 
Black Cat Lounge, for cool re­
freshments.
There is an old adage to the 
effect that, “A satisfied customer 
is the best advertisement.” If 
this is true then the, social activi­
ties on the evening school campus 
will have many added salesmen.
THROW AWAYNICOTINE
When the Filter in Medico 
Pipes or Cigarette Holders 
turns brown, throw it 
away with the nicotine, 
tars, juices and flakes 
it has trapped. Insert 
a fresh Filter to get 
cooler, cleaner, 
dryer, purer 
smoking!

Henry Louis M. Durand of Paris, 
France, is attending Carnegie Tech 
under the terms of a Rotary Foun­
dation Fellowship awarded to him 
last June by Rotary International, 
world-wide service organization.
One of 85 outstanding students 
to be awarded fellowships for ad­
vanced study abroad, he is study­
ing theoretical and experimental 
physics, in preparation for a 
teaching career.
Mr. Durand was born in Istan­
bul, Turkey, 22 years ago. He took 
courses simultaneously at the Uni­
versity of Paris and the National 
School of Mines in Paris. He re­
ceived the degree of Licence d’en- 
seignment (the equivalent of an 
American master’s) from the Fac­
ulty of Sciences of the University.
Despite his heavy academic 
schedule, Mr. Durand maintained 
a high scholastic standing. His 
extracurricular activities included 
swimming on the normal school 
team, and social work in connec­
tion with the establishment of a 
recreation center near Paris for 
laborers from North Africa.

sored him as a Fellowship candi­
