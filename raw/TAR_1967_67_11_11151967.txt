Hutchins Speaks in Assembly 
On Principle of Ideal University
Dr. Robert M. Hutchins, Pres­
ident of the Fund for the Re- 
fs public, Inc. and the Center for 
the Study of Democratic Insti­
tutions, eulogized Carnegie Tech 
at the Tuesday morning assem­
bly. Dr. Hutchins urged other 
Technical schools to folow suit, 
to dissolve as autonomous en­
gineering schools; to unite the 
(i great disciplines f humanities 
and science in the form of the 
liberal arts university.
Science, the search for under­
standing, has become a search 
for power—Big Science, under 
persuasion of money and propa­
ganda has turned our technolo- 
| gical schools and universities in­
to instruments of industry. In 
these schools, the search for un­
derstanding has been usurped, 
says Dr. Hutchins. There has 
been an enlistment of scientists 
in a national quest for prestige 
and power, under the pressure 
to keep ahead of the Russians.” 
The role of the professor has 
^ changed so drastically as to 
have made him the organizer 
and merchant of the work of 
others. Science and technology 
are thus being exploited for 
purposes of power to threaten 
the human race.
This unrestricted pursuit of 
power, warns Hutchins has his- 
!* torically proved suicidal, not 
merely murderous. He suggests: 
Stamp out engineering schools 
and let us redefine and revital­
ize the concept of liberal educa­
tion in our universities.
We must not blame scientists, 
but the individual scientist must 
be freed for pure rather than 
applied scientific research. The 
scientist must deny a concept 
of moral neutrality even to the 
point of refusing to make him­
self useful to research involving 
the development of instruments 
for human anihilation.
Directing Technology
How can technology be direct­
ed to enhance rather than des­
troy human life?
Dr. Hutchins listed a five point 
program which he believes is 
indispensable to our society for 
survival: In order to subject 
technology to human control, we 
must:
1. redefine and restore liberal 
education.
2. redefine and restore the lib­
eral arts university.

Ideal University Define
Based on the principal of un­

would be a rather small self-

Open House Begins 
Panhellenic Rush ’67
Panhellenic Council will spon­
sor an Open House on Sunday, 
November 19, 1967.
(1) These parties will be held 
in the fraternity duplexes and 
will begin with an assembly in 
Skibo Wherrett Room at 1:00.
(2) Any girl who is or may 
be interested in pledging a soror­
ity first semester Must Attend 
this function. However, to at­
tend this function a girl must 
have attained at least a 2.0 or 
better during any grading per­
iod prior to this function (this 
includes mid-term grades). 
Therefore only those who have 
attained at least a 2.0 are eli­
gible to rush and pledge first 
semester. There will be a sim­
ilar set of parties second semes­
ter for those who did not meet 
this requirement first semester. 
The required attire is dresses 
and heels.
Price Increase 
Possible In Grill
Chairman of Student Food 
Management Council, Tony 
Lawrence, announced at the re­
cent meeting last Tuesday dl­
l-67) that those using the snack 
bar in Skibo may have to pay 
a higher price for food, “if they 
do not begin clearing their tab­
les of trash like they are sup­
posed to.” The mess caused by 
students leaving trash on tables 
is becoming an alarming and in­
creasing problems. “When we 
placed small signs on tables 
asking people to bus their own 
trash, they were destroyed and 
ignored.” The only way to keep 
the grill cleaner is to have a 
staff member, full-time, const­
antly clearing tables and noth­
ing else. Though no definite 
prices were mentioned specific­
ally, Lawrence did state that: 
“Prices on some items would be 
raised $.05 in order to pay for 
this extra employee, and coffee 
would be the first to go, in all 
probability, up to $.10 and $.15.
The TARTAN and STUDENT 
FOOD MANAGEMENT COUN­
CIL urges all students, faculty 
and staff that use the snack 
bar to dump all disposable trash 
into the paper bags both up­
stairs and downstairs so that a 
price increase will not be nec­
essary.
Heinz Award Oilers 
Study Abroad Funds
The Vira I. Heinz Award, es­
tablished at Carnegie-Mellon last 
year, annually enables a wom­
an student to travel abroad be­
tween her junior and senior 
years. The purpose of this $1,-
000 award “is to have an articu­
late and perceptive young wom­
an gain first-hand knowledge of 
the international understanding 
and share her experience with 
other members of the college 
community upon her return for 
her senior year.” The first grant 
was awarded last year to Liese 
Hess, a history major in Mar­
garet Morrison, who used the 
money to spend her summer 
traveling in Germany, Austria, 
Denmark, and England.
Her trip began June 15 when 
she flew from New York to 
Frankford, Germany, on a stu­
dent group flight. She spent the 
first week in West Germany vis­
iting relatives. Then she travel­
ed to Berlin for five days where 
she had the opportunity to cross 
the border into the eastern sec­
tor. Visiting East Berlin, de­
serted but for Russian soldiers 
carrying bayonets and tourists 
wandering around empty streets, 
proved to be a fascinating ex­
perience, according to Liese. Af­
ter seeing Berlin she spent five 
days in Copenhagen and then 
ten in London “a more exciting 
city even than New York.”
The major part of the sum­
mer, however, Liese spent at the 
University of Vienna summer 
school located on Lake St. Wolf­
gang near Saltzburg. There she 
took three courses — Advanced 
German, 19th and 20th Century 
Austrian Literature, and Aus­
trian Painting from the Middle 
Ages to the Present — all of 
which were in German.
By being in an atmosphere 
with Austrians and Eastern Eur­
opeans, she learned a great deal 
in addition to what was taught 
in class. The school also spon­
sored several one day excur­
sions to Saltzburg and the sur­
rounding areas, plus a four day 
weekend in Vienna. After six 
weeks of studying Liese return­
ed to the U.S. with a “hectic and 
wonderful summer behind her.”
Applications for the Heinz 
Award are now available in the 
Financial Aid Office, 21 C War­
ner Hall. The application in­
cludes sections on itinerary, bud­
get, courses of study, and rea­
sons for desiring to participate 
in the program. Financial aid 
need not be a criterion. How­
ever, if it becomes a factor, the 
applicant should discuss the sit­
uation with the director of Fi­
nancial Aid.
Junior women interested in 
being considered for this award 
must submit an application to 
the Financial Aid Office by Jan.
5, 1968. A winner and three al­
ternates will be selected and an­
nounced on Feb. 1, 1968.

This summer will mark the 
initiation of a project never be­
fore attempted at our school. 
Fifteen to 20 C-MU students 
will be selected to travel to Min­
danao State University in the 
Philippines, to take part in a 
cross - cultural experience with 
the students of MSU. By tutor­
ing in high school and college 
level math and English and by 
sharing skills in music and the 
fine arts, and by joining in ex­
tracurricular projects, our stu­
dents will better understand the 
problems of a developing coun­
try, as well as contribute to the 
social well-being of that college 
community.
The Philippines Project, spon­
sored by the Campus YMCA 
will also include visits and orien­
tation in Manila, Hong Kong 
and Tokyo. Students and fac­
ulty who might be interested in 
fnther details of this project 
are invited to attend an assem­
bly on Mindanao, to be held at 
4:30 pm Thursday, Nov. 16, in 
room 40, Skibo.
Mindanoa State University is 
a young school, organized in 
1962 to provide an educational, 
social, and cultural center for 
the area comprising the islands 
of Mindanoa, Sulu, and Pala­
wan. The Mindanoa region has 
a great amount of natural re­
sources, which are just beginn­
ing to be tapped and there is a 
great potential for the develop

R.J. Cameron Grant 
For Foreign Study
The Financial Aid Office has 
announced that the Selection 
Committee for the R. J. Camer­
on Grant for Foreign Study is 
now ready to receive credentials 
from applicants. The procedure 
is as follows: “Each applicant 
shall during the fall semester of 
his senior year prepare a pros­
pectus showing his plan for 
study abroad and the arrange­
ments he has already made to 
implement those plans. He must 
notify the Committee on Finan­
cial Aid as soon as he has been 
accepted for study at the Uni­
versity of his choice. With his 
prospectus should be submitted 
a transcript of his grades, a let­
ter of recommendation from his 
department head, a photograph, 
and a biographical sketch. These 
application materials should be 
presented at the office of the 
Committee on Financial Aid and 
addressed to the Mr. and Mrs. 
R. J. Cameron Grant Selection 
Committee by Feb. 1 of the ap­
plicant’s senior year.”
The purpose of the award is 
to allow the student to partici­
pate more fully in his new en­
vironment without regard to fi­
nancial stress. It is hoped that 
he will use this freedom to in­
vestigate, and hence form an un­
derstanding of, the significant

velopments taking place outside

learning in this region. Game- 
gie-Mellon University is part of 
a 15 school consortium, funded 
by the Ford Foundation, that 
is providing assistance to the 
educational pursuits of Minda­
noa.
Because Mindanoa is a young 
university, it has many prob­
lems to be met before it can 
provide a truly top grade edu­
cation for its students. Facilities 
are limited, and there is a short­
age of experienced faculty. It is 
felt by the Y Philippine’s Com­
mittee that there is much a 
group of Tech students can 
learn, and much they can con­
tribute through participation in 
this experiment at Mindaoa, The 
project is conceived on a “com­
munity development” model, 
C-MU students work on proj­
ects already developed by our 
Filipino counterparts.
Students who apply to the 
project will be expected to par­
ticipate in its planning and at­
tend an orientation program. 
The orientation will take place 
in the Spring semester, with six 
to eight weekly meetings deal­
ing with aspects of the project 
and Philippine life, included will 
be a weekend training work­
shop. Costs are expected to ex­
ceed $1,000 per person, of which 
each individual will be expect­
ed to cover at least $500. Funds 
to defer the cost of the project 
will be provided by the YMCA 
of Pittsburgh and C-MU. Some 
scholarship aid may be avail­
able.
The assembly at 4:30 pm on 
Thursday will feature Mr. and 
Mrs. Scheirer, former Peace 
Corps volunteers at MSU. They 
will show slides of Mindanoa 
and discuss problems and con­
ditions on the MSU campus. Ber­
nard Dobroski, chairman of the 
Philippines Project, and Tom 
Huff, director of the Campus Y, 
will provide additional informa­
tion on details of the project 
and answer questions. If you 
are unable to attend this meet­
ing, further information can be 
obtained from room 57 in Skibo.

EDITORIAL
A—7—Lh CIo.K ELL s2HvH CI
This past week, the American Foreign Policy Forum generated 
quite a bit of activity opposing the use of napalm in Vietnam.
The members of the American Foreign Policy Forum were 
arguing that the use of napalm is bad while seeming to ignore the 
fact that war itself is bad. And there in lies our basic disagree­
ment with the AFPF. Napalm isn’t bad because it is used in 
war. War is bad because it uses things like napalm.
That is the point which should be at issue. War is destruc­
tive. Whatever the weapons or causes, war kills.
We feel, that, in taking the stand it has, the AFPF has con­
fused a cause with an effect, has prostituted the ideals of an anti­
war campaign. (Note: In this editorial, anti-war means just that. 
It does not mean anti-Vietnamese war unless specifically referred 
to as such.)
War seems to be something by which human beings are fas­
cinated until they are faced with the reality of war.
The United States today seems to be sporting a mentality 
reflecting some of that fascination, in addition to several oither 
maladies. It seems our society is undergoing that period when 
its flaws are coming to the surface. American society has become 
prosperous, and yet is so uneasy in its prosperity. Although a 
majority of this country’s citizens live rather well, there is a 
question as to the workability of a system which allows squalor 
to exist only a few miles from “the great society.”
We have as the foundation for our government some of the 
most beautiful statements of individual and group rights ever 
created, and yet we are just getting around to granting a large 
minority of the people the most basic of those rights.
Americans, on the whole, are unwilling to give up material 
gains and creature comforts for espoused causes. There is a men­
tality rampant in the country which will yell, “Burn, baby burn,” 
protesting oppression, and then turn to the “oppressors” to re­
built the cities. There are arguments for state’s rights in Con­
gress, but heaven help the Congressman who tries to reduce fed­
eral aid to state’s.
These are all, as well as Vietnam, symptoms of maladies 
which guide the actions of the country. It is that mentality which 
must be attacked, not this war in particular as opposed to the 
war in Detroit or the war in Watts. By concentrating on the Viet­
nam campaign, the AFPF is losing sight of the broader view that 
war, in itself, is horrid.
There have been several cases in history when men have 
come forward to argue for the broader truths rather than con­
centrating on specific problems. For example, Christ was an ac­
tivist. He openly confronted the Pharisses on the steps of the tem­
ple, but he did not sit down in the middle of the temple and say, 
“I shall sit here until you drag me away. And I know you’ll drag 
me away.”
In our opinion, the AFPF, on the other hand, does not ac­
tively campaign for its beliefs. Their activity is confined on the 
most part to setting up literature tables and napalm dances. But 
these activities do not seem to be “going out among the people.” 
If the members of the AFPF were to conduct a door to door, peo­
ple to people campaign across this city, then, perhaps, the would 
be fulfilling a need.
By coming into a college community where they are assured

of success rather than going out into the world where they may 
be spat upon for their views, kicked by little old ladies, or oppress­
ed in general, the AFPF is not facing reality. To be against the 
war in Vietnam on the college campus is an acceptable thing. 
But the AFPF seems to be saying is “please give me the resurrec­
tion without the crucifiction,”
If the Forum chooses to ignore all of the above comment on 
the basic truths of society and upholds its anti-napalm track, then 
we must upbraid them for being even more insincere and having 
less conviction that we thought at first. If napalm is bad, then 
why have we heard no protests against the Egyptian government’s 
use of napalm against civilians in Yemen? In that case which was 
documented by the International Red Cross, napalm runs were 
made specifically against civilian, non-military targets. The napalm 
killed no one. It was not supposed to. It was used as a standard 
military method to overcome the morale of the civilian popula­
tion.
If the AFPF asserts that it, indeed, has the goal of ending 
war, why have they chosen napalm to demonstrate against over 
the Russian orbital bombing system? Napalm cannot hold a can­
dle to an orbital nuclear device, whose chief function would be 
mass destruction without regard to your social position or draft 
status.
If the AFPF defense is that they are only concerned with 
American’s actions, then they suffer from the same afflictions as 
the old “American First” groups did, and from which the Far 
Right suffers now. Instead of considering humanity as a whole, 
they are considering the American subsection of humanity. In­
stead of considering the human condition, they are considering 
the American human condition. This view, by the fact of its sheer 
partisanship, accomplishes nothing.
In order to accomplish something positive, we feel education 
is necessary. Not mere practical skills, but philosophy, thought, log­
ic, and sensitvity training—education designed to make the in­
dividual aware of his role in society. Not American society, but hu­
man society. Ideally, we could develop the kind of man who would 
be outraged by the fact that his government would defeat a rat 
control bill, the total cost of which equalled one hour’s fighting in 
Vietnam, as by the use of jellied gasoline to main civilian popula­
tions.
We must not be anti-war, or anti-prejudice, or anti-anything. 
We must develop a positive attitude toward ourselves and other 
men. We must, each of us, take a look at the human condition and 
try to understand it.
Thought may not be as much fun as a march. Striving to real­
ize the ideals of peaceful existence by education may not be as 
immediately fulfilling as picketing, but in the long run it will be 
necessary for those who would change the nature of our society, 
to replace the present system of thought with a new set of ideals. 
If nobody is thinking, we shall be unprepared to function.
And so, we advise the American Foreign Policy Forum to look 
at its goals—its reasons for existence—and then its activities. We 
feel that they will find a wide gap. We suggest that the Forum, 
and all other interested parties, set up a reading section in the 
library, not on the war in Vietnam, but on human thought and 
its pursuit.
By doing that, we may be able to affect a few college minds. 
By going out into the communities—reaching the people in any 
way possible—talking for humanity and not against anything— 
we may be able to reach a few more people.
And maybe, someday, if we really believe in ourselves, we 
may be able to convince other people to believe in us. Then war 
will become a silly exercise in applied stupidity, and people will 
know other people care.
It is worth a try.
Letters to the Editor 
Student Wife Feels 
Aid is Unfair
Editor, The Tartan:
While I am not a student at 
C-MU, I am the wife of a stu­
dent. I have become so angry 
with C-MU’s Financial Aid Po­
licy that a letter of rebuttal to 
that policy is in order.
A married student’s financial 
need is based upon his father’s 
annual income, because 1. It is 
fair; 2. It is not “normal” for a 
20-year-old boy to be married— 
two statements which deserve 
more discussion. To whom is it 
fair? His father who must be 
responsible then for tuition pay­
ments? His wife who goes with­
out (snow tires and boots) so 
they have enough for rent, food 
and other such luxuries? The 
student who must endure the 
insult of his family? The direc­
tor of financial aid would not 
answer these direct questions; 
he only would jcomment that it 
is unfair to unmarried students 
if married students are judged 
differently.
Then he toild me my husband 
(20) is not normal because he is 
married. This should delight 
C-MU as none of their students 
are “normal.” High IQ’s are not 
“normal”; great artistic talent 
is not “normal,” yet C-MU wel­
comes these qualities. They 
should also recognize and wel­
come a mature student whose
3.0 factor qualifies him for a 
scholarship. His married status 
should be ridiculed; nor his 
pride trampled by a policy as 
archaic as the Pennsylvania con­
stitution, but harder to change.
Very truly yours,

Student Finds 
Atmosphere Stifling
Editor, The Tartan:
Ever since early this morn­
ing when I was going to my 
8:30 class, I have found it in­
creasingly difficult and less en­
joyable to breathe. Even by 8
a.m., the chimney on top of ma­
chinery hall was well on its 
way to clogging up the air with 
dense, black, smoke.
And it continued. By 3:30 pm 
it was impossible to see the hill 
across the river and extremely 
difficult to discerne the Pitt Ca­
thedral. But still the smoke con­
tinued in what seemed to be a 
relentless battle against the at­
mosphere in favor of hydrogen 
sulfide and nauseation.
I am not sure what they were 
burning, but I am sure that this 
is the first time this year that 
such thick, copius, fumes have 
been emitted from the chimney. 
If it would be possible to limit 
such burnings to a smaH part of 
the day or during the night, I

Dedicated to the principle of 
understanding, the true liberal

would be held up to criticism by 
the others, wThere science would

disciplines.
International rule of law rath­
er than competition of nations 
is the means Dr. Hutchins ad­
vocated for directing science and 
technology toward the common 
good of the race. His concern 
for liberal education in our 
country has involved him with 
this vital issue of the moment. 
Stop the war immediately and 
turn to the vital issues of sur­

a solemn audience with some 
strong points to contemplate.

Culture Worth 
Fighting For
Editor, The Tartan:
Reference Mr. Rutans letter 
to the editor of 1 Nov., 1967.
All rational people fear war 
and its consequences. However, 
many people are willing to fight 
and die for what they believe in.
The American form of repre­
sentative government and the 
American way of life are as 
much a part of our culture as 
our artifacts and works of art. 
Are we to give up our freedom 
and way of life in order to save 
part of our culture? This would 
be penny wise and pound fool­
ish. I think that all of our cul­
ture is worth fighting for.
Freedom as v\* know it in the 
United States does exist under 
the Communist governments of 
Russia and China.

“Mime” Helping 
Peace Cause?
Editor, The Tartan:
Wihen our President, our gen­
erals or our officials display the 
superficial nature of their think­
ing and the irresponsible char­
acter of their decisions, my in­
born abhorrence of violence and 
my disapproval of our Vietnam 
policy is reinforced. But when 
the opponents of the war show 
an even greater lack of respon­
sibility, of good taste, of ration­
al thinking and of constructive 
ideas, then I must say that, he- 
las, my confidence in the peace 
movement is weakened.
This is what happened to me 
last night (Nov. 5) while I 
watched the performance of the 
San Francisco Mimes, who were 
insulting the memory of Gol­
doni with their adaptation of L’Amant Militaire.
The memory of Goldni was not 
the only victim of the Mimes’ 
lack of tact and of taste. As an 
Italian antifascist, I was upset 
at hearing “Bandiera Rossa” 
(“Red Flag," an old revolution­
ary song) sung with a slow, 
wrong cadence; the Jews were 
insulted by hearing the Jewish 
accent (I was told) from the 
lips of the dislikable figure of 
Pantalone, the traditional Vene­
tian mask of middle-class man, 
whom the Mimes had tranform- 
ed into a Shylock; the Catholics 
were insulted by seeing the 
Pope in heaven played by a pret­
ty girl in papal robes perched 
on a ladder; people of good 
taste were insulted by a vulgar­
ity which did not even have the 
compensation of being sexy; 
and finally the American liber­
als were insulted by seeing their 
principles distorted and made in­
effective by a bunch of youngs­
ters who had nothing construc­
tive to offer.
Do the San Francisco Mimes 
really believe that they are help­

Dean Should Refuse 
AFPF Request
Editor, The Tartan:
The American Foreign Policy 
Forum’s request of Dean Brown 
for a grant of $2,900 is objection­
able for two reasons. First it is 
contrary to the established po­
licy of the two existing campus 
political organizations, Young 
Republicans and Young Ameri­
cans for Freedom, of not re­
questing subsidy by students 
not supporting the oi'ganizations. 
The rationale for this practice 
is that it is improper to request 
people to finance the propaga­
tion of political opinions con­
trary to their own.
Since the requested $2,900 
dollars would be obtained from 
student activities fees, it would 
amount to a subsidy by the stu­
dent body. That the AFPF does 
not represent the viewpoint of 
the majority of C-MU students 
was evidenced by demonstration 
at the Penn Theatre last fall at 
which the American Foreign Po­
licy Forum members chanted, 
“Hubert Humphrey, LBJ, how 
many kids did you kill today?”
The most serious objection to 
the request, however, is the 
manner in which it was made. 
Pressuring the administration 
rather than petitioning Student 
Congress is an insult to the stu­
dent body and a denial of legiti­
mate student power. The right 
to allot or deny funds to student 
groups rest with the student 
body, through their elected rep­
resentatives in Student Con­
gress.

Gatherings Make 
Skibo Difficult
Editor, The Tartan:
It is becoming extremely dif­
ficult to tolerate Skibo. If one 
wishes to enjoy our student cen­
ter he must first adjust to the 
presence of various sorts. I ask 
you; how can Skibo present an 
area of relaxation and enjoy­
ment when one must contend 
with throngs of engineers, 
groups of Maggie Murphs, 
crowds of Dramats, swarms of 
P and D’s, hippies, gatherings of 
professors and graduate stu­
dents (even those Mudge peo­
ple), members of the Adminis­
tration, huge woman’s clubs 
meetings, guest speakers, com­
puter rats, “upward bound” 
teenagers, musicians, green men, 
food service personnel — men, 
women, and children. This has 
got to stop.

Bergson Examines 
USSR Inefficiency
In the second of a series of 
Fairless Memorial lectures, Dr. 
Abram Bergson states that Mos- 
cow-style socialism is less effi­
cient than capitalism and sug­
gests that the reasons include 
over-centralization in industry 
and bureaucratic political con­
trols in management, together 
with a distorted price system.
In his speech entitled “Sources 
of Inefficiency,” these flaws 
are often more elusive and 
sometimes less critical than 
critics of the Soviet economy 
generally believe .
Pointing to the Soviet use of 
piece-work by factory workers 
as a method to spur efficiency, 
the Harvard professor noted 
that piece-work “has often been 
employed where it is technologi­
cally inappropriate” and that 
“the worker, understandably, 
has tended to limit his exertions 
in periods preceding an anti­
cipated review of output norms.”
Russian taxes on labor efforts 
also tend to impair efficiency 
in the economic system, Dr. 
Bergson said. “The precise way 
in which this occurs is not al­
ways fully understood, but the 
essential point is evident and 
this suffices here.”
The desire of the Russian la­
borer to serve his country has 
been, historically, a factor in 
the USSR’s labor effort, But, 
Dr. Bergson noted, “the reser­
voir of socialist idealism on 
which the government has thus 
been able to draw, by all ac­
counts, was at a peak in early 
years. The war apart, it has 
dwindled ever since.”
Management Limits Goals
On the managment side, Dr. 
Bergson said that the formula­
tion of target goals is determ­
ined through negotiations be­
tween government agencies and 
industral management. Almost 
inevitably, the Harvard scholar 
noted, “the management, whose 
success is judged by and who 
receives bonuses in proportion 
to the degree of fulfillment of 
targets, seeks to limit these 
goals so that fulfillment will be 
easier. The management is also 
frequently reluctant to overful­
fill targets,” since overfulfill­
ment could create pressure from 
above for still higher goals in 
the future.
Another inefficiency factor, 
Dr. Bergson said, lies In Rus­
sia’s emphasis on gross output. 
Thus, despite special controls, 
“managers find it in order to 
sacrifice quality for quantity.” 
He added:
“It is still surprising to learn 
that among products examined 
in the first half of 1962 by in­
spectors of the Ministry of 
Trade of the Russian Republic,
33 percent of clothing articles, 
25 percent of knitwear, and 33 
percent of leather shoes had to 
be rejected or reclassified in a 
lower quality category; and that 
among clothing and knitwear 
articles inspected by the Minis­
try of Trade of the Ukraine dur­
ing 1963, 20 percent to 25 per­
cent had to be condemned as 
defective.”
Also, he continued, because of 
uncertainties in supplies, “man­
agers board scarce materials, 
thereby bceome still scarcer, so 
that it is not at all unknown 
for enterprises to be holding se­
veral years’ supply of one or 
another critically - short mater­
ial.”
The role of superior agencies 
in fulfilling functions that are
performed by the market in 
capaitalistic economies is still 
another factor of inefficiency, 
Dr. Bergson said. “How ineffi­
cient have superior agencies 
been? If we may judge at all 
from observed behavioral pat­
terns, surely to an imposing de­
gree,” he said, but added, 
“though no doubt still not quite 
as much as some of the more 
vigorous critics have contend­
ed.”
In his overall view of Russias’ 
economy, Dr. Bergson concludes 
that evidence on the sources of 
inefficiency “tends to be quali­
tative . . . but the resultant 
waste manifestly could be siza­
ble.”
Dr. Bergson is the fifth Fair- 
less lecturer at Camegie-Mellon 
University. The annual lecture 
series, sponsored by the Uni­
versity’s Graduate School of In­
dustrial Administration, is held 
as a memorial to Benjamin F. 
Fairless, former chairman of 
United States Steel Corporation.

Anti Napalm Dance 
Held Here
The American Foreign Policy 
Forum held a dance-rally last 
Thursday afternoon in Skibo to 
focus campus attention upon 
America’s use of Napalm in the 
Vietnam conflict. This dance-ral­
ly culminated a week of prepa­
ration for the Dow Chemical 
Company campus interview held 
on Thursday in Skibo.
In addition to AFPF policy 
statements distributed to the 
general student body, letters had 
been individually sent to each 
chem. E. and grad student, ex­
plaining Dow’s present involve­
ment in the production of Na­
palm and herbiolds for use in 
Vietnam.
The dance-rally consisted of 
the Reynolds Blues Band play­
ing in the Skibo lobby, flanked 
by two immense banners which 
presented AFPF’s argument 
against the ati-civilian use of 
napalm, and a throng of curious 
onlookers.
The Post Gazette representa­
tive expressed amazement at 
the form of the rally asking 
when are the pickets and beat­
niks going to show up? Lynda 
Vogel, a member of the AFPF 
executive committee explained 
that “We merely wished to draw 
thè student’s attention to this 
issue without resorting to the 
violence typically awaiting Dow 
representatives.”
Dow’s recruiters later stated 
their gratitude for this unusual 
anti-napalm presentation. In an 
interview granted to two AFPF 
members offered to have a com­
pany public-relations representa­
tive visit the campus to explain 
Dow’s moral position on this 
conflict to a small selected group 
of students and faculty. “As 
long as the Carnegie students 
are showing such a responsible 
attitude towards this issue we 
would be willing to talk it over 
with them.” Such an interview 
has not been granted for other 
campuses, and may represent 
another step towards serious 
discussion of individual support 
at the Vietnam conflict,” said 
Frank Marra, of AFPF. Dow 
according to the recruiters is 
afraid to send a representative 
to a campus to address a ma­
jor, open student assembly, be­
cause of the various undesirable 
types of attention which would 
be drawn to an “official Dow 
debate.” “Such interview has 
not been granted for other cam­
puses and may represent anoth­
er step towards serious discus­
sion of support of the Vietnam 
conflict,” said Frann Marra, of 
AFPF.
Whatsit like to work for a giant?
Depends on the giant. If the 
giant happens to be Ford Motor 
Company, it can be a distinct 
advantage. See your placement 
director and make an appoint­
ment to see the man from Ford 
when he visits your campus. 
We could grow bigger together.

Some people get experience in a job.
Other people get older. There’s a big difference. And it all depends on where you work, and with whom you work. You can start some place that has all the proper systems engineering creden­tials — significant contracts, modern physical plant, and the usual fringe benefits — and find yourself a couple of years later, just a couple of years behind.
Or, you can come to a place like MITRE and get experi­ence. And grow. We have the credentials, of course. (We happen to think they’re the best.) But we have something more. An attitude. We want you to get the best systems experience in the business. We want to share what we know with you, want you to absorb it as fast as you can. The quicker you grasp things, the quicker things get done.
The more experience you get, the faster you grow.

THERE ARE NO BAD TEACHERS; 
THERE ARE ONLY BAD STUDENTS
The academic year has only just begun and already 
one thing is clear: you’re not ready for college.
What, then, should you do? Should you throw up your 
hands and quit? I say no! I say you must attack, grapple, 
cope! I say America did not become the world’s leader in 
motel construction and kidney transplants by running 
away from a fight!
To the question then: You say you’re not ready for col­
lege. You’re too green, too naive. You lack maturity.
Okay, the answer is simple: get mature. How? Well 
sir, to achieve maturity you need two things:
a) a probing mind;
b) a vest.
A probing mind will be quickly yours if you’ll remem­
ber that education consists not of answers but of ques­
tions. Blindly accepting information and dumbly 
memorizing data is high school stuff. In college you don’t 
just accept. You dispute, you push, you pry, you chal­
lenge. If, for instance, your physics prof says, “E equals 
me squared,” don’t just write it down. Say to the prof, 
“Why?”
This will show him two things:
a) Your mind is a keen, thrusting instrument.
b) You are in the wrong major.
Ask questions, questions, and more questions. That is 
the essence of maturity, the heart and liver of education. 
Nothing will more quickly convince the teachers that you 
are of college calibre. And the tougher your questions, 
the better. Come to class with queries that dart and flash, 
that make unexpected sallies into uncharted territory. 
Ask things which have never been asked before, like 
“How tall was Nietzsche?” and “Did the Minotaur have 
ticks? If so, were they immortal?” and “How often did 
Pitt the Elder shave?”
(Incidentally, you may never know the complete an­
swer to Pitt the Elder’s shaving habits, but of one thing 
you can be positive: no matter how often he shaved and 
no matter what blades he used, he never enjoyed the 
shaving comfort that you do. I am assuming, of course, 
that you use Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades, a 
logical assumption to make when one is addressing col­
lege men—which is to say men of perspicacity, discrimi­
nation, wit, taste, cognizance, and shrewdness—for 
Personna is a blade to please the perspicacious, delight 
the discriminating, win the witty, tickle the tasteful, 
coddle the cognizer, and shave the shrewd.
(I bring up Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades be­
cause the makers of Personna Super Stainless Steel 
Blades pay me to write this column, and they are in­
clined to sulk if I omit to mention their product. I would 
not like to see them unhappy, the makers of Personna, 
for they are fine ruddy men, fond of morris dancing and 
home brewed root beer, and they make a blade that 
shaves closely and cleanly, nicklessly and hacklessly, and 
is sharp and gleaming and durable and available both in 
double-edge style and Injector style.
(And from these same bounteous blademakers comes 
Burma-Shave, regular or menthol, a lather that out- 
lathers other lathers, brother. So if you’d rather lather 
better, and soak your whiskers wetter, Burma-Shave’s 
your answer.)
But I digress. We have now solved the problem of 
maturity. In subsequent columns we’ll take up other is­
sues, equally burning. Since 1953 when this column first 
started running in your campus paper, we’ve tackled 
such thorny questions as “Can a student of 19 find hap­
piness with an economics professor of 90 ?” and “Should 
capital punishment for pledges be abolished?” and “Are 
room-mates sanitary?” Be assured that in this, our 14th 
year, we will not be less bold.

President and Board of
Directors 
Dow Chemical Company 
Midland, Michigan
Dear Sirs:
I understand that the Dow 
Chemical Corporation supplies 
Napalm and herbicides to the 
Department of Defense for use 
in Vietnam; further, I under­
stand that these weapons are 
being used in such a fashion 
as to:
1. Bum and maim ten civ­
ilians for every enemy killed.
2. Cause long-term debilita­
tion of the civilian population 
through contamination of food 
and water supplies.
I also remind you that the 
Treaty of London and the Nu­
remberg War Trials place the 
guilt for these civilian deaths 
on your hands as well as the 
military’s.
Not wishing to share in f his 
guilt by my silence, I call upon 
you to cease the manufacture 
of weapons of genocide and re­
emphasize the production of 
consumer goods.

“Sure it’s my first year with B&W, but I’ve been too 
busy to think about that. I’ve been working in my field 
all along, and the training sort of blends right in.”
If Randy Trost sounds like a B&W booster, you 
should hear what his supervisor says about him.
We’re looking for aggressive, talented young engi­
neers like Randy. We want you if you want significant 
responsibility from the start. In fact, we need more 
engineers than ever before. That’s because we’re grow­
ing faster. Sales were $560 million last year. Up 17 
per cent.
That’s how it’s been from the beginning. We started
out making steam generation equipment. That led to 
atomic power stations, nuclear marine propulsion 
equipment, refractories, specialty steel, machine tools, 
computers, and closed-circuit TV. (And we still make 
the best boiler in America.)
If you’d like to talk with Randy Trost about B&W, 
call him collect at our facility in Lynchburg, Virginia, 
AC 703 846-7371.
In the meantime, be on the lookout for the B&W 
recruiter when he visits your campus.

ANTHONE REVIEW
Now Is The Time For All Good Men 
—a show for different drummers
by Tony Lawrence
“If a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps 
it ds because he hears a different drummer; let him then step to 
the music which he hears, however, measured or far away.” The 
above selection by Thoreau, sums up a brand new off-Broadway 
musical called Now Is the Time for All Good Men. I first heard an 
early version of the show last October when its authors Gretchen 
Cryer (book and lyrics) and Nancy Ford (music) came to Tech 
to perform it for the Drama Department as if it were being shown 
to potential investors. It had an appealing bright lift to it and, 
through it was too soon to tell of its commercial value, made a 
favorable impression.
Last week I chanced to see it in the produced form. It now 
has a brilliant set by Holly Haas, fine lighting by Carol Rubinstein, 
a great cast and should be seen. The show would be an excellent 
choice to see during Thanksgiving vacation for those Who will 
be in New York.
The plot, rare for off-Broadway musicals, is well constructed 
and meaningful. A young, free-thinking school teacher, fresh from 
a Vietnam court martiail, comes to Bloomdale, Ind., to take a job in 
the local high school. The townspeople are bigoted, conservative, 
suspicious and, as it turns out, terribly vicious. He proceeds to 
teach some pretty modem things to these kids and spread around 
some far too liberal thoughts, like civil disobedience and ‘To thine 
ownself be true,” etc., etc. In addition, he falls in love with a 
naive, young, music teacher and proceeds to try and educate her 
as well. She, at first, seems anxious but later finds herself con­
fused and ambivolent about this bright, young man.
In the end he is accused of being a communist, because of 
disloyalty to the good old USA and is run out of town; leaving 
the town and its folks as ignorant as when he came.
What Nancy Ford, Gretchen Cryer and director Word Baker 
have created is somewhat of a convention with a unique individ­
ualistic quality. We’ve all heard of towns like Bloomdale and the 
people in them. Yet there is an emotional involvement one feels 
from this show. The characters are real and in some cases horrify­
ing believable.
Aside from its delightful aspects, the show evokes a certain 
shock and disgust. One continually asks, “How could these people 
be so stupid?”
David Cryer, as the school teacher, is magnificent. Letting the 
text come through and playing with great simplicity, he holds the 
stage exceedingly well. Sally Niven, as the music teacher, is equal­
ly fine. An intelligent stroke of casting makes her not the typical, 
pretty, young thing, but a specific, realistic, interesting, character. 
Their scenes and duets together are beautifully done and poignant. 
They both sing very well.
Giving unusually good support are David Sabin, Judy Frank, 
Anne Kaye and Regina Lynn. Miss Frank generates much excite­
ment and goes through her paces in a dazzling manner. Steven 
Skiles is obviously a gifted, young man. He appeared, however, 
to be slightly inconsistent at the performance caught. His con­
tribution, however, to “A Star on the Monument” was tops.
Settings by Holly Hass remarkably imaginative and apropos 
to the production. The balance and color employed by Miss Haas 
are a tremendous asset to the overall result, as is her use of slide 
projections.
Word Baker’s direction has an unequalled palish and skill. 
Utilizing the total theatre for effect was never strained or false. 
His staging and movement is superb to say nothing of the excit­
ing way in which the revolving stage and upstage black streamer 
curtain are brought into play.
Musical director Stephen Lawrence, Hal Gaylar on bass and 
percussionist Danny Epstein are all first rate.
Now Is the Time for All Good Men is playing at the Theatre 
De Lys in Greenwich Village at 121 Christopher Street. It may 
be seen nightly, except Monday, with a Sunday matinee at 3.
To reiterate, it is a show that should be seen by all and is 
excellent fare.

Gridiron Record Ends at 4-4-0
by Ed Dolbow
A devastating offense and a sturdy defense enabled' the Carnegie »MeilonTartans 
to build a 49-0 lead in the first half and coast to a 56-16 win over Washington and 
Jefferson at the Tech bowl last Saturday. The victory in the season finale allowed the 
Tartans to finish with a 4-4 log.

though the Tartans are losing 
sortie key personnel, most of the 
team is intact and next year the 
ehsb coaid have a very good 
season.
After the opening kickoff the 
teams exchanged punts before 
the Tartans mounted a drive 
from their own 31. A pass in­
terference call on one of W&J’s 
defensive backs moved the ball 
to the 34 of the Presidents. Zak 
ran for eight followed by an off­
side penalty which put the ball 
on the 20. From there Hubka 
ran for 15 and then circled the

end for the TD. The extra point 
attempt was blocked.
On the next drive Ken Ba- 
torski intercepted a W&J pass 
on the Tech 38. After several 
running plays Hubka hit Tony 
Bugel for a 25 yard gain to the 
30. Batorski then caught a swing 
pass and ran for the touchdown. 
Tony Bugel made a diving catch 
slanting over the middle for a 
two point conversion to make 
the score 14-0.
On the next series of downs 
the Presidents tried for a first 
on their own 42 but the runner 
was tackled for a five yard loss 
leaving the Tartans in excellent 
field position. A pass to Bell and
a run by Ghetto left the ball 
on the 24 followed by another 
interference call in the endzone 
which put the ball on the one. 
The quarter ended after two un­
successful plunges into the mid­
dle of the line.
The opening minute of the 
second period left everyone on 
the field and in the stands 
breathless. On the first play 
from scrimmage Zak went off 
right tackle to score with Cher- 
ney converting. After the kick- 
off Ghetto came up with a fum­
ble recovery on the 20 after a 
mad scramble to get the foot­
ball. Chemey got free to catch 
another TD pass from Hubka. 
The next time W&J got the 
ball Gene Giamelli and Dennis 
Weakland cracked quarterback 
Rick Mason to cause a bobble 
in the hand-off. Again Ghetto 
was there as he stole the ball 
allowing the Tartans to take 
over on the 26. On first down 
Dick Bell made an over the 
shoulder catch in the endzone 
for the third touchdown in 43 
seconds. Cherney boomed 
through another kick to make 
the difference 35-0.
After the ensuing kick-off the 
Presidents made a first down 
but Bill Halsted pilfered a pass 
on the 46 and Tech took over 
again. Ghetto caught a swing 
pass running it down to the 
14. After a nine yard loss Ba­
torski faked a run through cen­
ter and caught a quick pass 
over the middle running it in for

the score. Chemey’s kick made 
it 42-0.
The Presidents returned the 
kick-off to the 23 but they were 
forced to punt. A roughing the 
kicker penalty gave them a 
first down on the 48 but once 
again the Tartans forced a fum­
ble with Zak recovering on the 
29. A pass was completed to 
Bugel on the 15 followed by a 
10 yard run and an unnecessary 
roughness penalty on W&J. 
With the ball on the two Bugel 
came up with another great 
catch for the touchdown. Giar- 
nelli kicked the point and the 
score stood at 49-0. It was the 
fifth touchdown pass thrown by 
Hubka to tie his record of the 
week before. The first half end­
ed with W&J forced to punt 
due to a 14 yard loss on a blitz 
by Zak.
Giamelli kicked off to open 
the second half. The presidents 
notched a first down but once 
again Charlie Zak was there as 
he grabbed a pass on the 34. 
Joe Chemey went up between 
three defenders to catch a pass 
and ran it to the 10. Zak made 
the TD on another Hubka pass 
as Hubka established a new 
school record of six touchdown 
passes in a single game. This 
touchdown and Garnelli’s extra 
point kick ended the scoring for 
the Tartans but it certainly 
didn’t end the excitement.
W&J was finally able to score 
on the next series of downs 
mostly on the running of Gary 
Gentile who made two long 
gains to move the ball to the 
Tech 26. Mason rolled twice, 
first to the 18 and then to the 
one. Gentile slanted off-tackle 
and Mason ran for two. The 
score now stood at 56-9. After 
an exchange of the football 
which included a fumble recov­
ery by Helsted the Presidents 
moved the ball to the Carnegie 
18 and Gentile ran the end for 
the TD. Mason hit George Such- 
ko for the two point conversion. 
This ended the scoring in the 
game, 5-16.
A rough game had been play­
ed all afternoon with several 
punches being thrown and on 
the next kick-off a melee en­
sued between the two teams 
next to the Tartan bench. The

the Tartans the ball. Again the 
Presidents got a fumble but this 
time it was Joe Funkhead inter­
cepting for Carnegie. Hubka, who 
had sat out most of the second 
half finally returned for one 
play in which he was thrown 
out for punching an opposing 
player. He was soon followed 
by John Slatowsky who got in­
to a fight with a defensive line­
man. The game ended with Bill 
Scatteragia pilfering a pass and 
almost breaking loose for the 
TD. It was the sixth interception 
for the Tartan secondary. Ma­
son was 6-19 so the Tartans 
caught as many passes as the 
W&J receivers. Hubka was 13 
for 18 for 223 yards to have
a fine day to end his career.
When Hubka was taken out 
in the third period he was only 
two short of the national small 
college record for TD passes in a 
single game set in 1963. Al­
though his shoulder was injured 
it would have been a great way 
to end his career and the sea­
son with such a record. The fans 
showed more enthusiasm than 
they have all year calling for 
Hubka’s return to the lineup 
throughout the fourth period. 
Dick Bell is leaving, too, after 
having set game, season, and 
career records for receptions and 
yardage and also career and 
season records for TD catches. 
Charlie Zak wil be missed for 
his fine play at the outside line­
backer position and hard hitting 
football. DeRusha has been a

FOOTBALL FOR SHUT-INS
At next Saturday’s football game while you are sitting 
in your choice student’s seat behind the end zone, won’t 
you pause and give a thought to football’s greatest and, 
alas, most neglected name? I refer, of course, to Champert 
Sigafoos.
Champert Sigafoos (1714-1928) started life humbly on 
a farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both 
named Walter, were bean-gleaners, and Champert became 
a bean-gleaner too. But he tired of the work and went to 
Montana where he got a job with a logging firm. Here the 
erstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. After 
a month he went to North Dakota where he tended the 
furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted to 
Texas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to 
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then 
to Kentucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat- 
toter). Then to Long Island where he dressed poultry 
(duck-plucker). Then to Alaska where he drove a delivery 
van for a bakery (bread-sledder). Then to Minnesota 
where he cut up frozen lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Nevada 
where he determined the odds in a gambling house (dice- 
pricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera 
lenses together (Zeiss-splicer).
Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tan­
nery, beating pig hides until they were soft and supple 
(hog-fiogger). Here occurred the event that changed not 
only Champert’s life, but all of ours.
Next door to Champert’s hog-floggery was a mooring 
mast for dirigibles. In flew a dirigible one day, piloted by 
a girl named Graffa von Zeppelin. Champert watched 
Graffa descend from the dirigible, and his heart turned 
over, and he knew love. Though Graffa’s beauty was not 
quite perfect—one of her legs was shorter than the other 
(blimp-gimper)— she was nonetheless ravishing, what 
with her tawny hair and her eyes of Lake Louise blue and 
her marvelously articulated haunches. Champert, smitten, 
ran quickly back to the hog-floggery to plan the wooing.
To begin with, naturally, he would give Graffa a pres­
ent. This presented problems, for hog-flogging, as we all 
know, is a signally underpaid profession. Still, thought 
Champert, if he had no money, there were two things he 
did have: ingenuity and pigskin.
So he selected several high grade pelts and stitched 
them together and blew air into them and made for Graffa 
a perfectly darling little replica of a dirigible. “She will 
love this,” said he confidently to himself and proceeded to 
make ready to call on Graffa.
First, of course, he shaved with Personna Super Stain­
less Steel Blades. And wouldn’t you? If you were looking 
to impress a girl, if you wanted jowls as smooth as ivory, 
dewlaps like damask, a chin strokable, cheeks fondlesome, 
upper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that 
whisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and 
nicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly? Would you not, 
in short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style 
and double-edge style? Of course you would.
Another Tech love-in gets underway.

So Champert, his face a study in epidermal elegance, rushed next door with his little pigskin dirigible. But Graffa, alas, had run off, alas, with a bush pilot who spe­cialized in dropping limes to scurvy-ridden Eskimo vil­lages (fruit-chuter).
Champert, enraged, started kicking his little pigskin blimp all over the place. And who should walk by just then but Jim Thorpe, Knute Rockne, Walter Camp, and Pete Rozelle!
They walked silently, heads down, four discouraged men. For weeks they had been trying to invent football, but they couldn’t seem to find the right kind of ball. They tried everything—hockey pucks, badminton birds, bowling balls, quoits—but nothing worked. Now seeing Champert kicking his pigskin spheroid, their faces lit up and as one man they hollered “Eureka!” The rest is history.
