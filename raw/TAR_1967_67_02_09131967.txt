Volume 67 — Number 2.Wednesday, September 13, 1967Andrew Carnegie’s Daughter Approves Of Institute MergerDean Brown States Stand vs. Discrimination Policy Neither To Condone Nor Hunt
by E. W. Seley
"There is nothing we do around 
here that 4s approved by every­
one,” remarked H. Guyford Stev­
er, president of Carnegie-Mellon 
University, in response to stu­
dent reaction to the renaming of 
their alma mater. Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology was offi­
cially dubbed Carnegie-Mellon 
University as of August, 1967, 
marking the affiliation of the 
two institutes.
Original proposals for the re- 
titling of the university in the 
Spring of 1966 included the com­
bination of the Carnegie and 
Mellon family name«. An an­
nouncement to the University 
community following the end of 
the 1966-67 school year stated 
that officials of Carnegie Tech 
had resolved any question of 
the renaming of the university.
What would Andrew Carne­
gie think of the academic and 
physical advances made since 
the founding of the universi­
ty? In answer to this Inquiry,
Mrs. Carnegie Miller, daugh­
ter of the school's founder, 
sent the following letter to 
President Stever before June 
graduation, 1967:
Dear Mr. Stever,
Thanks to your thoughtful­
ness in writing beforehand, we 
were able to think of you all 
on this unique Commencement 
Day.
I am so happy the merger be­
tween Carnegie Technical Col­
lege and the Mellon Institute is 
now an established fact. The 
words of Mr. Paul Mellon in 
announcing this are very fine 
and touched me deeply.
Your founder would share our 
pleasure today. He would be 
glad that the honored name of 
Mellon and all it stands for is 
joined with what he started in 
Pittsburgh many years ago as 
the Carnegie Technical School 
and the Margaret Morrison 
School. He would also be quick 
(Continued on Page 2)
The administration of Carne­
gie-Mellon University made clear 
its position of discrimination 
and the relationship between 
the school and student organiza­
tions.
In a strongly-worded state­
ment, the text of which follows, 
George K. Brown, Dean of the 
Division of Student Affairs, put 
forth what in his words was “a 
necessary step” in clearing up 
questions in student minds con­
cerning these policies.
“This document is to be taken 
seriously,” said Dean Brown, 
“for we mean to enforce it as 
strictly as possible.”
The administration will wel­
come reports of violations of 
this policy, and promises to act 
fairly and swiftly. It will not, 
however, conduct a “witch hunt.” 
Violations are to be reported to 
Dean Brown or other officials of 
the Division of Students Affairs 
for resolution.
To All Members 
of the University:
ESP Shown, Debunked In One Hour
Professor Darryl Bern con­
verted skeptics to believers in 
Extra Sensory Perception (ESP) 
and then reconverted them to 
skeptics.
Bern, an associate professor 
of psychology at CMU, cau­
tioned freshmen to regard as 
yet unproven these phenomena 
which are not tested for re­
liability. Hi« demonstration of 
ESP apparently had shown 
his powers of mental tele­
pathy, but he urged freshmen 
to control all experimental 
conditions and to repeat the 
experiments before the results 
are accepted as valid.
Concluding the freshmen ori­
entation program which began 
Sept. 8, Bern offered five in­
stances where facts were trans­
mitted to him by freshmen vol­
unteers apparently via ESP.
? Darcy Sheldon placed six 
articles in a shoe box. Bern told 
the audience what those articles 
were.
? The names of Andrew Beal 
and George List were selected 
at random from a stack of IBM 
identification cards. Bern told 
them their birthdates; zipcodes; 
fathers’ names; alma mater and 
occupations; mothers' maiden 
names and alma mater; and ex­
tra curricular interests.
? Three students who can 
sightread music were asked to 
concentrate on the notes of a 
hymn, the number of which had 
been drawn at random. Bern 
transcribed their thoughts to 
the music of Hymn 265.
? Five volunteers were given 
envelopes containing either 
blank paper or $20. Bern in­
structed them to exchange en­
velopes as often as they wished 
among their own and Bern's 
which was placed in front of a 
book. The owner of the $20 at 
the end of the exchanges would 
keep the money. Bern pocketed 
the money.
? Jane Rosenthal was asked 
to conceal herself behind a pil­
lar and to draw an object. Both 
Bern and Miss Rosenthal drew 
a house with four windows and 
with smoke blowing westerly 
from the chimney.
Bern concluded his demonstra­
tion by pointing out that scien­
tists have not accepted fully 
the results of tests which indi­
cate ESP’s existence beyond
chance.
Proponents of ESP, Bern said, 
are quick to cite apparent suc­
cesses. However, they do not 
mention these tests which fail.
In addition to neglecting to 
cite failures, proponents neith­
er control all variables in the 
experiment nor repeat the 
tests to prove reliability.
The policy statement regard­
ing student organizations which 
follows represents the desire of 
Carnegie-Mellon to make clear 
its philosophy and feelings in 
this area. This policy statement 
is not intended to be just a piece 
of paper which can be read and 
then filed or forgotten. It is the 
desire and intent of the Univer­
sity to enforce the policy as 
actively and effectively as possi­
ble. The cooperation of all stu­
dents, faculty, and staff is neces­
sary to accomplish effective en­
forcement. Thus, I urgently re­
quest that any violation of the 
policy be reported to my office.
Part II in no way is intended 
to interfere with the continued 
association Carnegie-Mellon has 
long had with with fraternity 
and sorority groups. It is design­
ed, however, to open direct lines 
of communication between mem­
bers of this academic commun­
ity and all organizations to pro­
vide a clearer understanding of 
our mutual responsibilities.
George K. Brown, Dean 
Division of Student Affairs
POLICY REGARDING 
STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS
I. Discriminatory Practices
Carnegie-Mellon University will 
not permit any student or other 
organizations to operate on cam­
pus with either by affiliation
with a national organization or 
by its own constitutions, by-laws, 
or established selection proce­
dure or practice, discriminates 
against racial, ethnic, or religi­
ous groups in the selection of 
its members.
n. The Relationship Between 
the University and 
Its Organizations
Social and professional organi­
zations, including student social 
groups such as fraternities and 
sororities, exist at Camegie-Mel- 
lon with the consent of the Uni­
versity. They exist because of 
the value which we feel they 
provide to the academic com­
munity. Carnegie-Mellon cannot 
assign sole responsibility for re­
viewing the operation or the 
practices of such organizations 
to any group exterior to the 
campus. The primary responsi­
bility for reviewing the activ­
ities and practices of campus 
groups has been assigned by 
the University to its Division of 
Student Affairs.
No student organization or 
chapter of a national organiza­
tion may exist on the campus 
without the ability of its officers 
to report directly to the admin­
istrative officers of the Univer­
sity on matters properly con­
cerned with University policy. 
The5 responsibility for these 
must remain with the Univer­
sity.
Kiltie Band Auditions-Friday
Thus, Bern said it was pos- _ . A l i •
sible to rig tests, such as using DCttUl tO lOUY Ft« I^UUCTClctlC^ChicClgO
false lids on containers. Theon
scientific mind must scrutinize 
fully method and results. Un­
accountable data should be clas­
sified as “unproven; a bizarre 
explanation, such as ESP, should 
not be concocted to explain 
them, Bern said.
Stever Welcomes 
Returning Students
During the fall, the March­
ing Band will present half-time 
shows at home football games, 
and will also travel to one 
“away” game. While member­
ship in the Concert Band is open 
to all men and women, member­
ship in the Marching Band is 
restricted to men.
The Bagpipe Corps is an im­
portant part of the Marching 
Band during the football sea­
son. During the concert season, 
it performs as a separate or­
ganization. Instruction and use 
of the instruments are available 
to the student at no cost, wheth­
er he has had previous experi­
ence with the bagpipes or not.
It is a pleasure to welcome 
all you returning students back 
to the campus at the start of 
another academic year. I hope 
you had a good summer, and 
I am glad that you are here 
again.
This is not just “another 
year;” it is, rather, a special 
year because it is the first one
for Carnegie-Mellon University. 
On June 8 I wrote a letter to 
all students giving some of the 
background for the change of 
name and outlining the major 
aims of the new University.
Now you have a busy year 
ahead, and so do the members 
of the faculty and the adminis­
tration. You have the job of go­
ing forward on the basis of your 
previous experiences here to 
make further progress on your 
own educational plans and per­
sonal development. We have the 
job of going forward on the 
basis of the existing strengths 
to make the most of the op­
portunities in the new University 
status. And as both of us work 
toward these ends, what we do 
well can and will be mutually 
beneficial.
Best wishes to all of you for 
a great year in 1967-68.
H. Guyford Stever 
July 20, 1967
Auditions for the Kiltie 
Marching and Concert Band will 
be held Fri., Sept. 15 at 4:30 in 
Exhibition Hall, College of Fine 
Arts. Auditions are open to men 
and women in all departments. 
There are openings in all sec­
tions of the band. Instruments 
will be provided if you do not 
have your own.
The Symphony Band, is one 
of the most highly regarded 
college concert bands in the 
country. For the past two years 
the Kiltie Band has given con­
cents in New York in Town HalL 
With a swirl of oolors and 
the skirl of bagpipes, the Car­
negie Tech Kiltie Symphony 
Band made its New York de­
but last night at Town HalL
... The band quickly settled 
down to an evening of solid 
music-maning. They perform­
ed with spirit . . . good inton­
ation remarkable flexibility 
... (with) rich senoritftes and 
and an impressive range of 
dynamic shadings.”
Robert Sherman— 
Hie New York Times
In addition to the annual con­
certs in Pittsburgh’s Carnegie 
Music Hall and the “Pops” con­
certs on campus, the Band will 
peform at many high schools in 
the Pittsburgh area and will 
make two extended tours. The 
winter tour will be to Ft. Laud­
erdale, Florida, and the Spring 
tour will be to Chicaso.

The Name Game
On June 5, 1967, Paul Mellon announced that we had a sur­
prising new name. Much sentiment has been voiced by the stu­
dent body opposing the name change. The Tartan, as the campus 
newspaper, should, we feel take interest in this development from 
a unique point of view.
As students, many of us feel that the change was done in poor 
style. Commencement was the wrong time and Paul Mellon was 
the wrong person, if the administration desired to keep cool heads 
prevailing amongst the student body. In addition, we feel that 
the reasons for the name change are mostly financial in nature 
and would like to see a chain of Carnegie-Mellon Banks open up 
across the city.
But as journalists, we must be quite a bit more analytical. 
There were reasons for making the announcement at commence­
ment. The name does recognize the family which has been, by 
and large, supporting several of the departments on campus.
However, we must ask several things of the administration. 
We should like to see this school carry out the implications of 
university status. We hope this will not be merely a semantic and 
financial change, but a change in attitude as well.
With expanded financial resources, the school will be able 
to begin construction of several sorely needed buildings (Tartan, 
May 17, 1967). As well, we hope there will be sincere course de­
velopment on the undergraduate as well as graduate level. This 
area has been sorely overlooked in the past, with most of our em­
phasis going to research and graduate studies.
In addition, we feel that the administration should think about 
expanding and improving the living quarters and Skibo. More- 
wood Gardens has needed a coat of paint for years, and the men’s 
dorms—nail of them—need quite a bat of work.
The Mid-Atlantic Council on Accreditation states that a uni­
versity will be given accreditation upon an “examination by the 
faculty, trustees, and administration of the institution in which 
they shall give reasons for the existence of the institution, shall 
examine the needs and achievements of the institution, and shall 
state plans for strengthening resources and increasing effective­
ness.”
The Tartan hopes that the administration of Carnegie-Mellon 
University, in considering us a changed institution and a new 
entity, will adhere closely to the requirements of the Committee 
on Accreditation.
Price Was Right
Many returning students were surprised to learn that L. E. 
Price, Director of Food Services since June of last year, had moved 
to another college.
Mr. Price was unique. He was totally dedicated to and respon­
sible for the development of,, a student-oriented food service pro­
gram at this institution. He went to great lengths to accomplish 
this end, including establishment of a dynamic Student Food 
Management Council, the development of a six week cyclical menu 
for students by students, and, most of all, a solid organization 
giving roughly 100 students jobs in positions ranging from waiters 
to * ushers < managers in policy making positions.
Those of us who were privileged to work with him here were 
sorry to see him go. We wish him luck in his new position as Di­
rector of Food Services at Luther College in Decora, Iowa.
Mr. Price trained a capable replacement in Steve W. Bucko. 
He has, thus far, carried out Mr. Price’s ideals, by expanding the 
number and nature of jobs available to students in the Food Serv­
ice Department. He has also instituted a bonus and incentive plan 
for student labor. The Tartan welcomes Mr. Bucko to the posi­
tion vacated by Mr. Price. We feel he will do a good job in keep­
ing this truly a Student Food Service.

Merger...
(Continued from Page 1)
to appreciate that the combined 
strength of this merger into 
Carnegie-Mellon University will 
provide much greater opportun­
ities for the ever increasing 
number of students from all 
over the world.
I can hear my father say as 
he did so often, "AH is well, 
since all grows better.” His op­
timism was unquenchable.
With every best wish to Car­
negie - Mellon University and 
kind regards to you.
Sincerely yours, 
Mrs. Carnegie Miller

The results of the merger with 
Mellon Instiute constitute ex­
pansion in research in the engi­
neering and science fields, and a 
continuation of endowment of 
the Fine Arts College and Grad­
uate School of Industrial Ad­
ministration. In addition, a co­
educational liberal arts college 
joins the ranks of the universi­
ty campus. “No thought of 
changing Scottish traditions that 
have grown-up around campus 
exists,” commented Robert J. 
Kibbey, Vice President for Plan­
ning.
Students returning to Carne­
gie-Mellon University and fresh­
men entering academic areas in 
the community should “start to 
build and be part of the univer­
sity,” stated President Stever, 
“for a name is incidental — the 
work is good no matter what 
the name is.”

DALE PESCHEL 
President, Student Senate
Certainly, by now the first freshman class of Carnegie-Mellon 
University must be over-welcomed. However, it is only right for 
the President of Student Government to add a welcome as well 
The class of 71 represents a new era in the history and tradi­
tion of this school. And, if the segment that went to Freshmen 
Camp is a representation of all the freshmen, this class has the 
promise of meeting all the challegenges that lay ahead.
Hopefully, interested freshmen got some idea of Student 
Government at the Activities Fair on Monday. Still we want to 
encourage all interested students to participate in Student Gov­
ernment. There are numerous positions still open on committees— 
for more specific information, either Tom Moore or Dale Peschel 
can be helpful.
So far work is progressing everywhere. Homecoming plans 
are rapidly becoming reality, and Mike Smolens, Homecoming 
chairman, has indicated that some exciting entertainment has al­
ready been scheduled. The Academic Affairs Committee is being 
chosen, with three members needed from Student Govememnt 
and one from the Fine Arts Student Council.
All things considered, the year ahead looks very good.
Deferment Request Playboy Editor to 
Deadline - October 1 Discuss New Morality
Colonel William C. Grimm 
from the Pennsylvania Head­
quarters of the Selective Service 
System has accepted Carnegie 
Mellon's invitation to visit the 
campus to speak at a meeting 
of all male students. This meet­
ing will be held on Sept 19th 
at assembly period, 11:30 a.m., 
in the gymnasium. Colonel 
Grimm will explain the new 
regulations in the amended Se­
lective Service law which went 
into effect July 1, 1967, concern­
ing students.
There are several changes
from the regulations used last
year which make important
differences In obtaining stu­
dent deferment:
(1) It is now the student’s 
responsibility to request student 
deferment. The school can no 
longer do so. SSS Form 104 to 
be used for this purpose is 
available in the Selective Service 
office, .Warner Hall 211. This 
form must be on file with each 
local board by Oct. 1st to qualify 
a registrant for student defer­
ment and should be sent direct­
ly to the local board. The school 
will certify only enollment as a 
full-time student as soon as 
possible after registration.
(2) Rank in class is no longer 
a factor in determining student 
status, nor is the grade on the 
Selective Service Qualification 
Test.
(3) An undergraduate student 
who is making satisfactory pro 
gress as defined by the school 
is eligible for deferment so long 
as he remains a full-time student 
until he receives his first degree 
or becomes 24 years of age, 
whichever status is reached 
first. At that time his Selective 
Service number will be placed 
in the prime age group.
It is our understanding that 
deferment for graduate students 
who have been accepted for the 
coming academic year or who 
have already begun a graduate 
program will be given a 2-S 
classification for the academic 
year 1967-68 for 12 months. Be­
yond this transitional year there 
is no assurance that graduate 
study will continue to be de­
ferred except in fields consider­
ed necessary to the national 
health, saietly and interest as
Anson Mount, senior editor of 
Playboy magazine and chief as­
sistant to Hugh Hefner, will 
talk Monday, Sept 18, at 4:30 
pm in the Skibo Ballroom. He 
will discuss "The New Moral­
ity.” The event is open to all 
students, faculty, and members 
of the Carnegie community. 
Participating in the discussion 
will be Dr. Richard Rubenstein, 
chaplain to Jewish students; 
Pastor Charles Carlson of the 
Lutheran University Center, and 
one of the Fathers of the Uni­
versity Oratory. The program 
will be sponsored by Carnegie's 
Office of Religious Affairs and 
the B’nai B’rlth Hillel Founda­
tion of Pittsburgh.
Mr. Mount's special interest is 
Playboy's relations with the 
churches and the clergy. He has 
done special studies at the The­
ological School of the Universi­
ty of the South to become fami­
liar with religious issues.
Mr. Mount will also appear 
on Sunday, Sept. 17, at the Hillel 
Brunch in the Faculty Dining 
Room, Skibo, at 11 am, when he 
will talk on "Playboy Magazine 
—the Church and the Synago­
gue.” That evening he will ap­
pear at the “Crumbling Wall" 
coffee house, 4515 Forbes Aven 
at 9:30 p.m.
A free brochure describing all 
of the programs is available at 
the Playhouse School office, lo­
cated at Craft Ave. at Hamlet 
St., Pittsburgh, Pa. 15213, or 
may be secured by calling 621-

lective Service.
Col. Grimm has stated that 
he is happy to have this oppor­
tunity to present Selective Ser­
vice matters relating to the ap­
plication of the new regulations 
to all college students. There 
will be a period during the 
meeting when students may ask 
him direct questions. This will 
be an important chance to get 
authentic information of concern 
to every male student at Car­
negie Mellon University.

Anthone ReviewA Summer of Cinema
Student Featured In Teen Magazine
. . by .. 
TONY LAWRENCE
Spending the summer out in 
tinsel town I was fortunate to 
be able to see an interesting as 
sortment of films. Some of them 
have not as yet come to Pitts­
burgh but in most cases will 
arrive shortly. Though these are 
capsule reviews, some of the 
films will be reviewed in length 
at a later date:
In the Heat of the Night: 
Basically a good film concerning 
cooperation in a mutual effort 
by small town, bigot sheriff Bill 
Gillespie (Rod Steiger) and Ne­
gro homicide expert Virgil 
Tubbs (Sidney Poiter). Aside 
from some overworked shots of 
sweat, flies on food, etc., the 
film comes off well. Norman 
(The Russians Are-Coming) Jew­
ison directed. Walter Mirisch 
produced. Screenplay is by Stir­
ling Silliphant
You Only Live Twice: The 
latest, and possibly the greatest, 
of the Bond flicks. Connery is 
on hand as Bond and does a ca­
pable job. Donald Pleasance is 
used to good advantage as Blo- 
feld. Lewis Gilbert’s direction is 
exciting and the pace is good. 
John Barry’s score is beautiful.
Eight cm the Lam: A film to 
be missed at any cost. Aside 
from a funny scene with Jona­
than Winters, the film is a taste­
less, vulgar waste.
The Way West: A good adapt­
ation of A. B. Guthrie’s Pulitzer- 
prize winning novel. Director 
Andrew McLaglen handled the 
actors well with Kirk Douglas, 
Robert Mitchum, and Richard 
Widmark all doing very good 
things with their assignments. 
Adequate support is supplied by 
Sally Field, Stubby Kaye, and 
Lola Albright. Harold Hecht pro­
duced.
To Sir with Love: A rather 
evasive film about slum children 
in East End London. Sidney 
Poitier, however, gives a stun­
ning performance as the teach­
er who tries to tame these slobs. 
James Clavell, who wrote, pro­
duced, and directed, has given 
the film a sappy, maudldn ending 
that ruins a potentially good 
script
Enter Laughing: One of the
all time great comedies pro­
duced by Carl Reiner and Jo­
seph Stein. Directed by Carl 
Reiner with a screenplay by 
Stein and Reiner. Based on the 
play by Joseph Stein; adapted 
from a novel by Carl Reiner. 
The story of Reiner’s entry into 
show business as a very young 
man, the picture should go right 
to the top of everyones must-see 
list. Jose Ferrer, Shelly Win­
ters, Elaine May, and Jack Gil­
ford evoke unbelievably convul­
sive laughter to say nothing of 
Reni Santoni, who plays Rein­
er with such magnificence that 
one can assume he will be a ma­
jor important star shortly.
The Bobo: A harmless film di­
rected by Robert Piarrish and 
produced by Elliott Kastner and 
Jerry Gershwin. The plot is in­
tricate, yet inconsistent. Peter 
Sellers is sort of funny; Britt 
Ekland is beautiful; and Ros- 
sano is handsome in his brief 
appearance. Don’t go out of your 
way to see it, but you might go 
out of your way to hear Fran­
cis (A Man and a Woman) Lai's 
score which is one of the best 
around.
The Thin Line: A Japanese 
film with sub-titles about a man 
who accidentally kills his mis­
tress (the wife of his best 
friend) and then must lie to his 
own wife about the murder. Fi
nally confessing, he is at first 
reassured and later alarmed to 
find that his wife thinks and 
worries much more about her 
family, their children, than she 
does about him. So much so that 
when he threatens to break-up 
the family by confessing to the 
police, she poisons him. Few 
laughs, painfully labored direc­
tion by Mikio Naruse but good 
performances by Keiju Kobay- 
ashi, Michiyo Aratama, Tatsuya 
Mihashi, and Mitsuko Kusabue.
Luv: One wonders why this 
film was made at all. Jack Lem­
mon is atrocious; Peter Falk 
makes a fairly hopeless attempt. 
Maybe they made it just to re­
inforce the feel that Elaine May 
is one of the funniest and most 
talented actresses around. If 
so, then that’s enough.
The Whispers: This picture 
will probably go down as one 
of the all time great master­
pieces. Run, don’t walk to see 
it Bryan Forbes has directed 
with great force yet marvelous 
subtlety. Edith Evans gives one 
of the finest performances ever 
put on film. Her total creation 
of the character is devastating, 
shocking and of such magnitude 
that when it is over you realize 
that greatness has been showed. 
Eric Portman is also superb as 
her unreliable husband. This 
film will be reviewed in length 
at a later time.
Hells Angels on Wheels: Noth­
ing outstanding to recommend 
it except some brilliant photog­
raphy by Leslie Kovacs and an 
exceptional score by Stu Phill­
ips Made on a very low budget, 
this work has obvious integrity 
in it though the audience appeal 
would seem limited.
King of Hearts: Alan Bates is 
good, but the film isn’t nearly 
as good as it should be and if 
made right could have become a 
classic. There is one of the most 
beautiful women I’ve ever seen 
who is the romantic interest in 
the film. Her name is Genevieve 
Bujold. Philippe De Broca’s di­
rection is alright for the most 
part yet there are some fine mo­
ments that are greatly moving.
Bonnie and Clyde: A startling 
film that will join The Whisper­
ers (though they are nothing 
alike) as a masterpiece. Warren 
Beatty not only plays Clyde but 
has produced the film as well. 
Faye Duneway portrays Bonnie 
and the two of them go around 
the country robbing banks and 
in the course of the picture mur­
der 18 people. Just a hackneyed 
crime film one might say. Well 
there is such perfection in all 
aspects of the production that it 
is draining on the psyche and 
though provoking to the mind, 
much in the same way The 
Pawnbroker was. Fabulous sup­
porting performances by Mich­
ael J. Pollard, Gene Hackman, 
and Estelle Parsons only add to 
its dazzling quality. Arthur 
Penn’s direction is flawlessly 
artistic.
Up the Down Staircase: Peo­
ple tend to like this picture as 
well as they should. Perhaps the 
reason is that it so simple, so 
skilled and so real that it hurts 
to see dt and concede to it. San­
dy Dennis plays Sylvia Barrett 
just as Bel Kaufman wrote her, 
and all of her mannerisms seem 
right at home. Patrick Bedford 
plays Paul Barringer. Though 
at first he seemed terribly mis- 
cast in retrospect, he was great. 
Eileen Heckart, Ruth White, 
Roy Poole, and Sorrell Booke 
all understand their parts and
Elayne Heilveil, a sophomore 
Drama student, is being featured 
in a special two page spread in 
the September issue of Seven­
teen Magazine.
Using combinations of make­
up and hair-dos to find her 
“look-of-looks,” Elayne is fea­
tured modeling the mod look, 
the romantic look, the pixie 
look, the sporty look, the glam­
our girl look, and the sophisti­
cated look.
Elayne is a graduate of New 
York’s High School of Perform­

tains of Pennsylvania.
were fine assets. Producer Alan 
J. Pakula and director Robert 
Mulligan (the team that did To 
Kill a Mockingbird) have used 
much the same taste and intelli­
gence with this film. It should 
be seen.
A word to the wise: Film Arts 
Society is one of the most en­
joyable events of the year. Aside 
from presenting unusual and 
hard-to-get films, the society of­
fers 28 films for $6. Some of 
the highlights of this semesters 
showings are: Shane, a Bill of 
Divorcement (Katherine Hep­
burn’s first picture and John 
Barrymore’s greatest perform­
ance), A Night at the Opera, La 
Strada, The Horse’s Mouth with 
Alex Guinness, Gold Diggers of 
1933, the original Phantom of 
the Opera, and Thirty-nine Steps.

From the Sideline
PRELUDE
Camegie-Mellon University now offers to its student body a 
diversified curriculum in the Arts, Sciences, and Liberal Arts. Such 
an institution should be able to attract more athletes of high cali­
ber to play varsity sports.
The reason for the poor performance in the past of var­
sity teams is the University’s financial aid policy. This policy 
is summed up by President Stever who in a speech before the 
Carnegie Admissions Council said: . . We are most desirous
that our varsity teams win a fair share of their games in 
competition with other schools whose academic standards and 
athletic programs are similar to ours.
“Carnegie has no scholarship for athletes only. We may offer 
financial assistance for athletic purposes, provided, that the aca­
demic qualifications of the applicant are acceptable. In making 
a decision on financial aid the factors considered are: academic 
achievements, recommendations of the school, need, extracurri­
cular activities including athletics, and alumni interviews . .
The University’s financial aid policy should be expanded to 
include aid to athletes without considering need. Athletic scholar­
ships should be used to encourage promising high school athletes 
to come here. Academic qualifications should be used as criterion 
for determining the amount of the aid to the athletes.• • • * *
Freshmen wishing to become members of the sports staff 
should drop a note to the Tartan office in room 50, Skibo.
