War Abolishd—Peace Enthroned.
Is this, the most terrible, most de­
structive and most uncalled for of 
wars to be the last between civilized 
nations? It certainly should be and 
can easily be made so, and the world 
thus cleared of its greatest crime. Ar­
bitration tribunals have already pro­
nounced righteous judgment in no less 
than six hundred and twenty-seven 
cases, and not one has been chal­
lenged. Four of the nations now en­
gaged in war have resorted to arbi­
tration before the Hague Tribunal 
for settlement of their disputes: 
France six times, Britain five, Ger­
many three, Russia two, and the 
United States three times. One of 
these disputes involved no less than 
twelve, another six nations, and the 
verdicts of the Tribunal were accepted 
without demur! When such peaceful 
settlement of international disputes is 
already within reach, why should not 
the nations named, inviting others to 
co-operate, agree that future differ­
ences shall be settled peacefully as 
these were? They could go a step 
further, if necessary, and resolve that 
nations refusing to accept such peace­
ful settlement shall resort to war at 
their peril, since Arbitration had be­
come the guardian angel of World 
Peace!
The five nations named, Britain, 
France, Germany, Russia and the 
United States, or substitutes for any 
of the five which may decline to act, 
have only to agree that disputes aris­
ing between any of the nations shall 
be thus arbitrated and, behold, blessed 
peace ascends the throne; men cease 
to act like savage beasts, killing each 
other, and we have before us—War 
abolished, Peace enthroned.
We have a World Supreme Court 
in the Hague Tribunal, which has been 
in successful operation for fifteen 
years. It was summoned by the pres­
ent Russian Czar, to whom the world 
owes an unpayable debt. He desired 
the powers “to devise, if possible, a 
means to put an end to the incessant 
armaments, and to seek a means of 
warding off the calamities threatening 
the whole world.” Twenty-six nations 
responded to this first call; to his 
second call no less than forty-four at­
tended. May it be his privilege soon 
to call the third Congress and thus, 
perhaps, perform the greatest service 
ever permitted to man.
Surely, after an armistice is estab-

F. E. Foster ’08 Named for the 
Position
The Ninth Annual Convention of 
the National College Athletic Asso­
ciation was held at La Salle Hotel, 
Chicago, December 29th, and there 
were present representatives of 
schools and colleges from all parts 
of the United States.
Director of Athletics, McCulloch, 
attended as official representative of 
Tech and Coach Steffen and the writ­
er were present unofficially and for 
the primary purpose of meeting the 
delegates and closing, if possible, the 
much delayed foot ball schedule.
The Convention was divided into 
three sessions, morning, afternoon 
and evening. The first session was 
given over to the reading of papers, 
the second session to the reports of 
committees and the third or evening 
session to a general discussion of the 
papers read in the morning. It was 
the morning and evening sessions 
that developed the real interest of the 
convention. A paper by Professor C. 
W. Savage of Oberlin College on 
“The Professional vs. the Educational 
in Athletics” had the effect of throw­
ing a bomb shell into the conference. 
He characterized football in our 
American colleges as commercialized 
and professional and asked how it was 
possible to expect a professional sport 
to turn out amateur sportsmen. He 
severely censured the sensational ad­
vertising that comes to the young col­
lege athlete, referred humorously to 
the space that was given in the press 
to the turning of an ankle of the star 
half-back and to the anxious public 
awaiting the news of the rumored in­
jury of this or that player, and the 
importing of old graduates to teach 
the young hopeful how to lengthen 
his punt one or two yards, and he de­
nounced the system of highly paid 
professional coaches, charging that 
the game was more a business or 
profession than a pastime. He main­
tained that the system of graduate- 
managers has gone far to commer­
cialize the sport. These men whose 
duty it was to increase gate receipts 
and to place the sport on a more 
profitable basis were fast causing the 
side show to obscure the main show.
He had no panacea for our athletic 
ills, but by way of suggestion offered 
the iritra-mural athletic idea as a sub­
stitute. He pointed out the advantages
Basketball Team Hopes to Open Sea­
son With a Victory.
Fred. E. Foster, Science *08 has 
been elected graduate manager at 
Tech. Foster played on the football 
team in ’06 and ’07 being the cap­
tain of the ’06 team the first team that 
represented the Plaid on the gridiron. 
He is also the man who started the 
Tartan and the Thistle, beside being 
the organizer of the White Friars, a 
dramatic organization which has late­
ly been displaced by the drama course 
in the Design School. Foster also 
prides himself in that he was the man 
to lead the first Tech cheer which 
was given at a hockey game between 
Tech and Yale many years ago, that 
is, in comparison with the memory 
the present student body. It can eas­
ily be seen that Foster devoted much 
of his time while a student to other 
activities besides his studies. He 
surely put as much into the school 
as he got out of it and the honor con­
ferred upon him by the election as 
graduate manager is a just reward for 
his services. Foster is a typical Tech 
man, a good fellow and a hard and 
conscientious worker; he is well able 
to bear all the responsibility that may 
be placed upon him. Prior to this 
year, he was connected with the 
Southern Pacific R. R. of Mexico in 
the capacity of superintendent.
As graduate manager, Foster will 
have three functions to perform; he 
will arrange the schedules for all our 
teams; he will have control of the 
student’s activities, and he will be 
publicity man for different things that 
come up around the school. At pres­
ent, he has been working on a foot­
ball schedule for the coming year, and 
recently attended the Western Con­
ference at Chicago. At this confer­
ence we were offered games with 
Notre Dame and University of Wis­
consin. Prior to this, we received 
bids from Purdue, Cornell, Penn 
State, Colgate, Johns Hopkins, Case, 
and West Virginia. How many of 
these teams will be met, cannot be 
said at this period. Cornell was anx­
ious to play us and offered three dates 
but the matter was closed before a 
graduate manager was elected. Cor­
nell has filled her schedule now and 
we will hardly play them in 1915. Ne­
gotiations have been practically clos­
ed to play Pitt and Western Reserve 
of Cleveland. It is hoped to bring
This Friday night at Trees gym­
nasium, Carnegie’s basketball team 
will meet the floor artists represent­
ing our ancient and time-honored 
rivals from the other side of the hill, 
Pitt. This game will open the sea­
son for both teams. Little is known 
of the comparative strength of the 
two fives. To say that a hard-fought 
contest is expected is putting it mild­
ly. Ever since Tech sprung up, there 
has been a considerable amount of 
rivalry between the two institutions, 
and this rivalry gives vent to itself 
in the most strenuous form when rep­
resentatives of the two schools meet 
in any kind of an athletic contest. 
Our boys would consider a season 
in any line of sport a success if they 
would triumph decisively over Pitt, 
even though they should lose every 
other contest in the schedule.
Pitt has been enjoying an undue 
amount of success over us lately and 
they have been gloating in the fact, 
judging from a publication printed re­
cently in one of our daily newspapers. 
One thing that must be said to their 
advantage is that in this article they 
give us an undeniable amount of 
credit for the good contest our little 
sturdy and fighting football team 
gave their “big league” aggregation. 
With this contest we believe “the 
worm has begun to turn.” We can­
not help thinking of the old adage 
that it is a long lane that has no turn­
ing.
Coach Marks has said that we 
are going to win Friday night. He 
expects such a result. We hope that 
the team that represents the Plaid 
will not disappoint him, and with a 
few breaks of the game coming in our 
direction we ought to win. With 
such a good prospect for a victory 
in sight, the student body should un­
doubtedly support the team to the 
man. Our students have gained much 
credit for the showing they made last 
November and comments have been 
passed by several authorities that it 
was the best cheering and rooting 
ever done by any student body in 
Pittsburgh. The effect on the team 
of this support clearly evidenced it­
self by the result of the contest. We 
have something to uphold now. We 
must show Pitt that we have the true 
spirit and that the student exhibition 
at the football game was not a spon-

PITTSBURGH, PA., JAN. 7, 1915
THE HONOR SYSTEM.
It is fast becoming an annual cus­
tom to comment on the Honor Sys­
tem and as long as such systems are 
proposed, we believe there should be 
discussion. The scheme suggested 
for the approval of the 1915 Science 
class is, we are told, not very differ­
ent from the one tried with little suc­
cess two years ago. The committee 
which drafted the code of regulations 
undertook their duty with the best 
intentions so that no criticism is to 
be made of them, but rather of the 
general idea of any so-called “honor 
system.” If after careful considera­
tion, it is deemed advisable for the 
Seniors to govern themselves by a 
stated set of rules, let the proposed 
system be shorn of its undesirable 
features and let a “self-government” 
instead of an “honor system” be 
adopted.
The expression, “honor system” is 
one which we have always resented 
because it implies the necessity of a 
penalty to persuade or compel stu­
dents to act honestly. He who be­
haves properly solely from fear of 
punishment is not honorable. The 
adoption of an “honor system” 
would infer, in our opinion, that 
those persons affected by it required 
some sort of regulation to force them 
to act honestly. This attitude seems 
very insulting. Personally we have 
the greatest faith in the large major­
ity of Carnegie undergraduates. We 
believe them to be gentlemen who are 
honorable as a matter of principle, 
and who will always act uprightly 
whether they are being watched or 
not. Toward the small number who 
are known to “crib”, we take a very 
selfish stand and for them we have 
the greatest contempt. They harm 
only themselves in addition to losing 
the respect of their classmates.
Furthermore, there arise in our 
mind questions like these: Are Sen­
iors the only ones expected to be 
honest? Should not the entire stu­
dent body be placed on the “honor 
system?” If there is to be an “honor 
system” it should apply to all classes; 
if there is to be a “self government” 
system it need be applicable to none 
others than Seniors.
It is a coincidence that an editorial 
on the same subject should appear 
just at this time in another college 
paper, the Grove City “Collegian,” of 
December 12. It is very much to the 
point and we quote it because it is 
in accord with our own views:
Honor System? Well no, Grove 
City College does not have a form­
ally organized honor system—but it 
does have upright men and women 
who face the examination period, (as 
all other tests in life) fairly and 
squarely. Great sacrifice is being 
made in the homes of many of us 
that we may have the greatest advan­
tage offered to the present generation 
of young men and women—a College 
education; a firm and reliable founda­
tion on which to build our lives.
We are governed by that honor sys­
tem that rules and shapes the destiny 
of all mankind—fairness with one’s 
self and with one’s brothers. He who 
holds dear his own self respect and 
the respect of his fellow students 
could never cheat; for to do so would 
be to place a weak stone in a solid 
foundation—a stone that would some 
day be the cause of a downfall.
It is hardly the duty of our instruc­
tors to police us. Further than that, 
our cheating could have no personal 
effect upon them except that they 
cannot help but pity one whose self 
respect can sink so low. What a mis­
take we make in thinking we are “put­
ting one over on them.”
“This first of all—to thine own self 
be true
And it must follow as the night the 
day,
Thou canst not then be false to any
man.”
DISCUSSION?
The preceding editorial represents 
merely the opinion of the editor. 
Many others, both faculty members 
and students will disagree with it and 
rightfully so if they have the ability 
to think for themselves. It is there­
fore suggested that a general discus­
sion be carried on publicly through 
The Tartan columns for the purpose 
of settling once and for all time, the 
question of the Honor System at Car­
negie.
A QUALITY PUBLICATION.
Jan. 5, 1915.
Editor of the TARTAN:
In the issue of the TARTAN for 
October 22, 1914, you published a let­
ter from me, in which I endeavored 
to interest all those connected with 
the schools in a technical publication. 
The original plan was subjected to 
considerable criticism, some of which 
was expressed through the columns of 
the TARTAN; and many valuable 
suggestions were offered to make the
proposed plan practical. By far the 
most encouragement was received 
from Mr. L. E. Griswold ’13, repre­
senting the Publication Committee of 
the Alumni Association, who are will­
ing to co-operate with the faculty 
and undergraduates to put out a 
creditable periodical, and who have 
promised to take care of the financial 
part of the proposition at the start.
The modified plans of the proposed 
publication have been worked out by 
several students and members of the 
faculty, and are as follows:
Title.
The proposed publication is to be 
known as
THE CARNEGIE JOURNAL 
Of Art, Science, and Engineering.
Published by the Faculty, Alumni, 
and Students of the Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology, Pittsburgh; is­
sued quarterly: in October, January, 
March, and June.
An All-School Activity.
The relation existing between the 
four schools comprising the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology is rather pe­
culiar. To a person connected with 
any one of the four schools the other 
three schools are almost foreign to 
him, while to the outside world these 
same four different schools are all 
known under the same name, and the 
reputation of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology is also the reputation 
of any particular school. Manifestly, 
it is to the interest of all schools to 
work together in showing the outside 
world the quality of the work that is 
being done here. It will also serve 
to acquaint the student of any one 
school with the work of the other 
schools, and to stimulate a closer re­
lation between the alumni and the un­
dergraduates.
Each Subject Treated Separately.
In order that the quarterly be of 
permanent value and of more than 
local interest, it was suggested that 
each issue be devoted to one class of 
subjects exclusively. For the present 
purpose the work of the Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology may be divided 
into the following three classes:
1. Engineering, representing the 
interests of all Departments in the 
School of Applied Science and of ths 
various Departments in the School 
of Applied Industry which are related 
to engineeirng, may be properly called 
subdivisions of the regular engineer­
ing courses, and of the Department 
of Architectural Engineering of the 
School of Applied Design.
2. Art, representing the interests 
of all departments of the School of 
Applied Design, Arts and Crafts de­
partment of the M. M. C. S., and the 
Department of Printing of the School 
of Applied Industry.
3. Science, representing the inter­
ests of the Departments of Physics, 
Mathematics, Theoretical Chemistry, 
Biology, Economics, etc., of the four 
schools.
Controlled by Faculty and Alumni.
The Carnegie Journal of Art, Sci­
ence, and Engineering, is not strictly 
a student activity, and therefore it 
was suggested that it be not made sub­
ject to the control of the various stu­
dent committees. The management, 
financing, and editorial policy is to
be determined and controlled by the 
Faculty and Alumni. Indeed, it is the 
duty of the Alumni to guard and to 
promote the reputation of our Alma 
Mater, while the Faculty can best di­
rect the work to that end. The edi­
torial staff is to be composed of mem­
bers of the Faculty and Alumni, with 
the exception of the Assistant Edi­
tor, who is to be a member of one 
of the two upper classes, and be ap­
pointed by the faculty and approved 
by the students.
In order to keep a more complete 
record of all scholastic activities, it is 
recommended that the secretaries of 
the various technical student societies 
make arrangements to send in to the 
editor stenographic report of all im­
portant addresses delivered before 
their respective societies by promi- 
nest engineers and scientists.
First Issue March, 1915.
The first issue of the Carnegie 
Journal of Art, Science, and Engineer­
ing will be out before March 1, 1915, 
and will be an Engineering number. 
Any further suggestions that help to 
make it a model number will be ap­
preciated. It is expected that a lib­
eral amount of contributions will be 
received before that time. The June 
issue will be an Art Number and the 
October issue will be a Science Num­
ber. Advance contributions for these 
numbers are solicited.

OUR MERCHANT MARINE.
It is gratifying to know there are 
some men at Carnegie who are inter­
ested in affairs outside their mere 
scholastic sphere. The question of our 
merchant marine deals with “one of 
the really big problems before our cab­
inet today and deserves some careful 
attention,” in the opinion of the 
writer, who is a Design School stu­
dent. He has secured much essential 
information through a representative 
in Washington and has embodied it 
in his article:
President Wilson says “our past 
policy of stunting the growth of our 
merchant marine has been a gross 
error.”
Every year the importance of ex­
tending our foreign trade is now real­
ized by manufacturers with greater 
force. Many factories at the present 
day are caused to curtail their output 
or remain idle because of the lack of 
marine transportation, and the foreign 
lands of a well-balanced merchant ma­
rine can readily discount local and 
domestic business.
Today we find ourselves in an 
alarming situation because we have 
stunted the natural growth of our 
merchant marine. Our foreign trade 
today is almost totally under the con­
trol of foreign nations, and we are 
entirely dependent upon subsidized 
foreign ships to handle our export 
trade.
Now that the present European War 
has called home those ships formerly 
under our subsidy, we are left alone 
without an adequate merchant ma­
rine to carry our plentiful supply of 
farm produce or of manufactured

“A SCHOOL OF THE THEATRE 
ARTS.”
Article by Prof. Stevens.
The November issue of The Drama, 
a quarterly publication relating as the 
title implies, to dramatic topics, con­
tains an interesting article by Prof. 
Thomas Wood Stevens, of the De­
sign School on the subject, “A School 
of the Theatre Arts.” It is quoted at 
length because it gives a very clear 
explanation of the work and aims of 
the dramatic course established at 
Tech last February.
“We were not, to put it quite blunt­
ly, concerned with whether a student 
should become an actor or not; we 
were concerned that he receive a se­
vere four years’ training; that he know 
the drama, its history, its literature, 
in a measure its technic, and perhaps 
that he have some hint of its social 
implications; and we thought it read­
ily possible to teach him many of the 
related crafts. With these premises 
the course was planned. It owes 
much to the broad taste and technical 
knowledge of the late Dean, Charles 
Russell Hewlett, and much to the ad­
vice of many men in and out of the 
theatre; actors, dramatists, critics, 
managers, and mere (but education­
ally shrewd) professors.
“During the first three years the 
curriculum allows the student little 
time to consider any high degree of 
personal specialization. He spends 
part of his first year in learning cor­
rect diction, a matter which, begin­
ning with severe and continued exer­
cise in reading, does not by any means 
end with the hours formally given 
over to it. He also begins drawing 
in the art school, and before the year 
is over applies this training to the 
sketching and tracing which are in­
separable from the work in the his­
tory of costume, and in elementary 
scene painting. Dancing is required 
throughout the course, the work be­
ing done not on the stage but in the 
great music room. French is required 
and some study of German, both lead­
ing as rapidly as possible to conver­
sation and the reading of plays.
“In a lecture course, the student is 
required to consider the history of 
the theatre, treating of its growth as 
an institution, its architectural and 
technical equipment at different peri­
ods, and the various methods and cus­
toms of play production in the past; 
all this is supplemental to the more 
extensive survey of dramatic litera­
ture, to which he must give a fair 
share of his reading time for two 
years.
“Historical surveys of painting and 
sculpture, of architecture, of furniture 
and decoration are all required, and 
all related in some measure to model 
making and scene painting. The girls 
substitute work in costuming for 
scene painting, but they do not forego 
the survey courses on that account.
“With all this, the student must 
still give most of his time to the re­
hearsal and production of plays, for, 
no matter what his ultimate intention 
may be, he must come to see a play 
as a thing of movement and emotion, 
of sound and picture, rather than as 
so many pages printed in a book.
“During his first months of work 
he deals mainly in short parts and 
short plays; then in Shakespeare, 
with a production, at least occasion­
ally, of a Greek play. At this writ­
ing (October) Iphigenia in Tauris is 
well forward. But because it was 
possible for us to avail ourselves, just 
at this time, of the services of Mr. 
Padraic Colum, and because we be­
lieved that the direct touch of the 
work of the Irish theatre would be 
profitable to the students, we are 
postponing Euripides for a few weeks, 
and putting on Mr. Colum’s play, ‘The 
Betrayal,’ along with Synge’s ‘The 
Shadow of the Glen,’ and Yeat’s mag­
nificent trumpetry of the poet, ‘The 
King’s Threshold.’
“This illustrates one of our favor­
ite theories about instruction in act­
ing, the plan of the visiting director, 
or guest master. We believe that 
great good may accrue to the student 
from working, for limited periods, 
under the instruction of different men, 
actors, dramatists or directors. When 
this is done, the visiting instructor 
has full swing, and matters of cos­
tume, scenery, lighting and business 
are all undertaken by the students in 
accordance with his wishes. The pro­
duction of ‘Two Gentlemen of Vero­
na,’ with which the theatre opened 
its doors, was thus in charge of Mr. 
Donald Robertson. We have found 
that in this plan we have the sympa­
thetic interest of some of the most 
able men in the theatre, and the stu­
dents look forward to these visits 
with the keenest interest.
“Productions of plays of modern 
life are to follow the drill in older 
and more formal manners. No set 
rule underlies the choice of plays; we 
do the work which seems likely to 
help, in the doing, the greater num­
ber of students engaged. We look 
forward to giving performances of 
plays written by our own students 
from time to time, as part of the reg­
ular work of those who take the 
course in dramatic composition. If 
the student can write a practicable 
play, surely his fellows should be 
ready to paint him a set and act in 
it, and through this he should get 
some view of his product other than 
that of the multitudinous unacted 
playwright who is convinced that the 
world conspires against him.
“In the fourth year of the course 
we plan to relax a little the severity 
of our requirements, to permit more 
daring experiment, to allow some 
personal specialization. We do not 
know what the student will make 
himself through and after this course 
—actor, writer, critic, manager, scene 
painter. We are not vitally concerned 
with the question, having before us 
the task of sending him out a trained 
man or woman, with an expanded and 
stimulated sense of resource, and 
some orderly knowledge of the back­
ground of his craft.”

goods. Who now suffers mostly from 
this unstable marine policy? It is not 
the shipper, nor the importer, nor the 
manufacturer, as one would assume, 
but it is the farmer, and now the 
farmer of the middle and western 
states, who has always opposed the 
free development and nursing of our 
own merchant marine, realizes that 
he is vitally interested in the American 
merchant marine. The foreign na­
tions now engaged in warfare have 
withdrawn their ships from our sub­
sidy, substituting older, slower and 
more inferior vessels to carry our 
trade, resulting in an increase of 
freight rates from coast to coast and 
in a vast shortage of even subsidized 
ships suitable for the transportation 
of our cotton and farm products.
Then, too, consider our navy. A 
navy large enough to cover the At­
lantic itself is useless unless accom­
panied by an adequate merchant ma­
rine to carry supplies, such as food, 
coal, and men. It falls little short of 
criminal stupidity to build a perfect 
navy and, at the same time, neglect a 
merchant marine.
It is very gratifying, however, to 
note that the present administration 
is eager to take the required steps to 
advance and aid the growth of our 
merchant marine.

new members present.
Plans were discussed for the ac­
quirement and installation of the pro­
posed 5 K.W. wireless set. Permis­
sion has practically been assured for 
placing the antennal from Machinery 
Hall tower to Chimney of the Insti­
tute Power House. Mr. Kaufman has 
offered to loan the Club for the pres­
ent his expensive receiving set, and 
the Pittsburgh Transformer Co. has 
kindly donated a transformer case for 
the 10 K.W. transformer which has 
already been constructed by the Club. 
This transformer will shortly be test­
ed out in the electric laboratory.

THE WESTERN COLLEGE FOR 
WOMEN.
Oxford, Ohio, like Cambridge, Mas­
sachusetts, has a name associated with 
academic distinction and has attain­
ed some academic distinction of its 
own. It is the seat of Miami Uni­
versity and two colleges for women— 
Oxford College and the Western Col­
lege for Women. This quiet village 
was the scene of an academic func­
tion of consequence on November 4, 
when President Boyd, of the Western 
College, was inaugurated. Repre­
sentatives of some sixty colleges and 
universities were in attendance, in­
cluding delegates from four well- 
known Eastern colleges for women— 
Smith, Wells, Mount Holyoke, and 
Bryn Mawr. President Boyd comes 
to his new position from the Ohio 
State University, where he was Dean 
of the Schoool of Education.
The Western College was built in 
1855, and was modeled on the lines of 
Mount Holyoke. A number of its 
faculty have come from the mother 
college, among whom should be men­
tioned its able Dean, Dr. Mary Saw­
yer, who has served faithfully for over 
twenty-five years. The first Presi­
dent of Wellesley College was called 
from the faculty of the Western Col­
lege.
Perhaps the most distinctive and in­
teresting fact about what the Wes­
tern College is doing at present has 
nothing to do with teaching at all. 
This college for women is maintain­
ing what is called a “composition fel­
lowship.” This includes a farm-house 
studio and a charming home in the 
college which is put to the use of the 
holder of this fellowship, one of Am­
erica’s most eminent composers, Ed­
gar Stillman Kelley. This is done for 
the purpose, not of having Mr. Kel­
ley teach music (though he does teach 
once a week at the Cincinnati Con­
servatory), but for the sole purpose 
of enabling him to compose.
We do not know anything that quite 
parallels this in America. There are, 
of course, research fellowships to en­
able scholars to carry on investiga­
tions and to contribute to the world’s 
store of knowledge; but we do not 
happen to know of any other case 
where an American college has estab­
lished a fellowship for the purpose of 
enabling its holder to contribute to 
the world’s store of art. Since Mr. 
Kelley has been at the Western Col­
lege, he has composed his “New Eng­
land Symphony.” This alone is 
enough to justify the experiment, for 
it is one of the few notable contribu­
tions of America to the world’s musi­
cal treasury. It ought already to have 
been widely performed in this coun­
try. It has been performed once here, 
huf. its notable hearing, perhaps, wa<= 
that which was accorded to it in Ger­
many. It is an anomalous condition 
which allows the performance of all 
sorts of experimental and ephemeral 
work of European composers and 
which renders the performance of an 
American work largely a matter of 
personal influence. Fortunately, there 
is a prospect that Mr. Kelley’s sym­
phony will have a wide hearing. In 
addition to the symphony, Mr. Kel­
ley has written a number of other 
compositions as well as his book on 
“Chopin, the Composer.”
We commend to other colleges this 
plan of endowing composers. Un­
questionably the musical literature of 
America was impoverished by the un­
reasonable burdens placed upon Mac- 
Dowell. Unquestionably other com­
posers have felt themselves cramped 
in this country because, while there 
is a great amount of money devoted 
to the performance of music, little is 
given for the encouragement of its 
composition. The Western College 
for Women ought to be proud of its 
distinction.
Outlook.
GRADUATE MANAGER IS ELECTED
Continued from Page 1 
the latter to Pittsburgh. We will play 
Pitt on the same date that they were 
played last year. The big game has 
not been closed yet. It will no doubt 
be a surprise to all, when we say that 
Tech in trying to bring the Univer­
sity of Pennsylvania here for a game. 
If we get them it will be quite a thing 
for us, as Pitt is also negotiating for 
a date. These are some of the teams 
that we will probably play next year. 
It is quite a change over the Waynes- 
burg, Geneva, Grove City, Bethany 
schedule. It will give our team a 
schedule in accordance to our stand­
ing as an institution of learning. 
While many may think we will be 
biting off more than we can chew, 
the plan of arranging a schedule with 
the above teams is althogether in ac­
cord with Coach Steffen’s idea as he 
has been consulted and feels that he 
could handle such a situation. What 
he has done this year gives us a lot 
of faith in his opinion.
ALUMNI DAY IN SCIENCE 
SCHOOL.
Scholarships and Football Sweaters 
Awarded.
The general lecture period of the 
week before vacation was turned over 
to the Alumni Association. Several 
prominent alumni addressed the stu­
dents and two scholarship awards 
were made. Mr. McCorkle, president 
of the Alumni Association, had charge 
of the meeting and introduced in turn 
“Winks” Dowling, Edmund Boots, 
Fred Foster, Alan Bright, “Jimmy” 
Knapp and F. R. Cogswell. All of 
these graduates urged the develop­
ment of a Tech spirit both in and out 
of school.
Mr. Bright awarded two scholar­
ships to juniors in behalf of the 
Alumni Association. When the mer­
its of the respective candidates were 
considered, it was found necessary to 
depart from the original intention and 
to split the scholarship between Wil­
liam Espy, of the Science School, and 
Karl Britsch, of the Design School.
D. L. Trautmann and K. S. Henning, 
both of the Science School, received 
honorable mention.
Mr. Knapp presented for his class 
of 1912 a scholarship, which will be 
a permanent one hereafter. Sen­
iors only were eligible and the
honor fell to Harry D. Balsinger, 
president of the 1915 class, with spe­
cial mention for Welch, Sheldon and 
Penterman.
Mr. McCulloch then presented the 
football sweaters to the members of 
the team who won their letters dur­
ing the past season, describing each 
man as follows:
Shining Light—Fletcher.
Ideal man—Welch.
One who made good—Marshall.
Little Fellow—Holzworth.
Center of attraction—Hellstrom.
Back of the center of attraction— 
Kesner.
Succeeded after a number of tries— 
Levy.
Captain of the Scrubs—Hautmann.
An ideal man—Balsinger.
Hard worker—Boileau.
Happy apples—Applegate.
“Anybody here seen—Kelly.”
A Belgian hero — Ex-Capt. Mc- 
Caughey.
Scratched gravel—“Villian” Parke.
Put the “Pep” in “Pepper”—Frank 
Rownds.
Best ever—Capt.-elect Lauer.
The new custom of giving blankets 
to the senior members of the team 
was instituted, the following men re­
ceiving them: Hautman, Levy,
Welch, Balsinger, McCaughey, 
Rownd, Kreider.
“Curly” Lauer closed the meeting 
with his first official appearance as 
next year’s football captain, when in 
a lengthy speech, he declared, “We 
must beat Pitt next year. That’s all 
we have to live for.”
“All right on behind there?” called 
the conductor from the front of the 
car.
“Hold on,” cried a shrill feminine 
voice, “wait till I get my clothes on.” 
All the passengers craned their 
necks expectantly. A small boy with 
a basket of laundry struggled aboard.

APPLIED INDUSTRIES
TEACHERS’ COURSE BANQUET.
Friday, December 18th, the German 
Club on Craft avenue witnessed a 
most successful Teachers’ Course Ban­
quet. At eight-thirty song started 
the ball of mirth rolling, only to be 
sharply halted by the announcement 
of a ready “Dutch Supper.” The 
room selected resembled a German 
“rathskeller,” and when Dean Con­
nelly entered he must have felt a 
trifle out of place. As is his habit, he 
served us food for thought in his talk 
on National Action and Controversy 
Relating to Industrial Education. 
Then Mr. Hartman deeply interested 
us with his “apres dinner” on the 
“Relation of the Industrial Worker 
to the Industrial Teacher.” We are 
indeed glad to have Mr. Hartman ex­
press his views; we only regret that 
he is so modest. The regular busi­
ness meeting was next called to or­
der, in which a monthly smoker or 
banquet was decided upon. The Lit­
erary Society then elected the follow­
ing officers:
President—F. A. Finlay.
Vice President—R. K. Merker.
Secretary-Treasurer—A. H. Shutz.
Critic—James Herb.
The evening closed after some 
songs and cheers, affecting the much 
desired union among members of the 
Teachers’ Course.
DEAN CONNELLEY HONORED.
During the recent gathering of the 
Pennsylvania State Educational As­
sociation at Harrisburg, Dean Con- 
nelley was elected a member of the 
Executive Committee of the Associa­
tion. This is a much coveted honor 
in the organization. The committee 
consists of five representative edu­
cators of the State and controls the 
administrative work of this large edu­
cational organization.
NIGHT DRAFTSMAN’S CLUB 
SMOKER.
The annual smoker of the Night 
Draftman’s Club, School of Applied 
Industries, held on Friday evening, 
December 18th, was the largest stu­
dent affair ever held at the Institute. 
Over 400 students gathered in Central 
Building for this occasion and thor­
oughly enjoyed the events of the even­
ing.
The program opened with an en­
thusiastic address by Dean Connelley. 
Then six interesting boxing bouts 
were staged, which were as clever ex­
hibitions of the fistic art as could be 
offered. Movies, songs and eats were 
all included in the program. Through 
the courtesy of the Wm. Wrigley, Jr., 
Company of Chicago, 300 packages of 
Doublemint were distributed gratis 
and the jaws of all worked overtime.
The evening was in charge of J. A. 
Stein, president of the club, and a com­
mittee consisting of Messrs. Schulte, 
Stack and Kenny.
GREETINGS FROM CARNEGIE
Continued from Page 1 
lished between the nations now un­
fortunately at war, the majority of en­
lightened people in all civilized lands 
will realize that permanent world 
peace would be Earth’s greatest bless­
ing and is entirely practicable through 
a union of a very few powerful na­
tions pledged to maintain it, and in­
viting all other civilized lands to be­
come members thereof, each nation 
contributing to the cost of such union 
ni proportion to its population and 
wealth. As nations accepted peaceful 
arbitration, armies and navies would 
rapidly fade away because no longer 
necessary, and the prophecy would 
soon be fulfilled that “men shall learn 
war no more.” The Brotherhood of 
Man would then have arrived, and 
life on this Earth flash forth glimpses 
of Heaven.
Meanwhile let us pity and forgive 
those who urge increased armaments, 
for “they know not what they do.” 
“Preparation for war”, by one nation 
invariably leads to “preparation 
against war” by the nations alarmed 
or endangered, and armies and navies 
find no limit to their expansion—as 
has been amply proven. “For what 
can war but endless war still breed?” 
asked Milton, poet and prophet, three 
centuries ago, and to this no answer 
has ever been or can be given! Let 
our motto, therefore, be “Preparation 
for World Peace,” strong in the faith 
that under this holy banner there can 
be no such word as fail.
ANDREW CARNEGIE.
PROF. TRINKS TO LECTURE.
“Two Thousand Years of Machin­
ery” is the subject of an illustrated 
lecture to be given by Prof. Willi­
bald Trinks at the Lyceum Theater 
Sunday, January 10, at 2:00 p. m. The 
lantern slides, the evolution of ma­
chinery. There will be no charge for 
admission.

days.
Director Hamerschlag has recently 
received a very early edition of Cic­
ero’s Orations from Mr. James H. 
Johnston of the firm of J. A. John­
ston, of Liberty avenue.
The boy was going away to school, 
full of high hopes.
“I shall make the football team and 
color two pipes the first year!” he 
said bravely.
His mother kissed him and wept. 
His father wrung his hands in silence.
They were too full for speech then. 
But, however, when he was gone, and 
they were calmer, they both talked 
of him, and prayed his ambition might 
not carry him beyond his strength.
Fond Mother: “Jane, has Johnny
came home from school yet?”
Jane: “I think so. I haven’t seen
him yet. But the cat’s hiding under 
the stove.”

The supreme success of successes, 
“Peg O’ My Heart,” with Elsa Ryan 
fresh from the world’s record of 700 
performances, will be the attraction 
at the Alvin following “Too Many 
Cooks.”
The story of Peg, so remarkably 
narrated by J. Hartley Manners, con­
cerns Peg, the daughter of an aristo­
cratic English woman, and who has 
married an Irish-Socialist, against the 
wishes of her family. At the birth 
of Peg, the mother passes away and 
the child is reared by the father. She 
is simple, natural and impulsive and 
when she is transplanted into the af­
fected, surface living family, the 
Chichesters, relatives of her mother, 
there are complications of all sorts. 
Peg’s rich uncle had made her his 
heiress and according to his will she 
is to be educated and brought up in 
England. The Chichesters are act­
ing as her guardians, and while this 
hurts their pride, the remuneration 
which they are to receive is at the 
time greatly acceptable. She is as 
much out of her element as the ever- 
existing “square peg in the round 
hole.” The harshness with which Peg 
is treated, the misunderstandings, 
makes the little alien eager to quit 
the house in which she has been ill 
treated, but she weathers the storm 
clouds and ends by becoming engaged 
to a Prince Charming, a nobleman 
with riches as well, and the play ends 
on Tom Moore’s text “Oh, there is 
nothing half so sweet in life as love’s 
young dream.

ANNUAL CONVENTION
Continued from Page 1 
that would surely come from caus­
ing it to be compulsory upon all stu­
dents of an institution to take part 
in some form of athletics and receive 
the same training as is now confined 
to the favored few upon the varsity 
squads. This he said would not alto­
gether do away with the inter-colle­
giate game, but a different spirit 
would govern the contests. Under 
such a system one college would be 
t\. n guest of the other, admission to 
the games would be by invitation, 
both institutions would declare a holi­
day and the faculty and students of 
the visiting college would be the 
guests of the faculty and students of 
the home college. Athletics under 
such an order would have to be en­
dowed and should be endowed, but 
the game into which foot ball is now 
degenerated, a mere popular specta­
cle commercialized and professional­
ized, where gate receipts, advertising 
and publicity are prime factors, would 
cease to exist. Colleges should “dis­
arm” and the educational replace the 
professional in athletics.
Mr. W. Houston Lillard of Philips 
Academy, Andover read a paper on 
the “Andover Plan”. The idea is to 
bring the students down out of the 
bleachers and onto the playing field. 
It is not different in any great de­
gree from the plan suggested by Pro­
fessor Savage in the preceding paper, 
and is really the intra-mural idea. Mr. 
Lillard read statistics of sports at An­
dover and showed that a very large 
percentage of the student body had 
taken part in some form of athletics 
during the past year. The highly 
paid coach had been replaced by vol­
unteer faculty and graduate coaches 
who taught all the under graduates 
the fundamentals of some game. In­
ter-school games are not eliminated, 
but schedules are shortened and var­
sity teams are organized only a few 
days before the inter-school contests, 
and the players are selected from the 
various other teams representing dor­
mitories, classes and streets. He 
mentioned that although Andover 
had suffered from its rival, Exeter, 
the past two years this could in no 
way be attributed to a fault in the 
Andover system. He showed that 
the Exeter team by reason of its 
foot ball material would have been 
victorious over Andover with any 
other system. Last season the Exe­
ter team out-weighed the Harvard 
and Yale teams.
Following Mr. Lillard, Head Coach 
Percy D. Haughton of Harvard 
delivered an off-hand address on the 
“Mental Training in Foot Ball.” Mr. 
Haughton brought a message to the 
Convention from a number of grid­
iron immortals, who have become 
successful in the business world. They 
sung the game’s praises and made the 
claim that the training they received 
upon the foot ball field had in a larg­
er measure, made for their later suc­
cess. Then the class room work. He 
pointed out, that the day had passed 
for the foot ball player, who was only 
heavy from his chin down; what was 
wanted in to-days foot ball, was the
man who also had weight from his 
chin up. He stated that foot ball in 
his opinion taught the very necessary 
lessons of preparedness, coolness, 
nerve, punctuality, and obedience. His 
talk although impromptu served in a 
way to combat the ideas advanced by 
the pervious speakers and was well 
received.
The afternoon session which cov­
ered the reports of various commit­
tees was of little interest save in a 
general way. The recommendations 
of the committee on changes in the 
foot ball rules were few and the com­
mittee on foot ball fatalities reported 
that but one player had met death 
as a direct result of the game.
The evening session was given over 
almost entirely to the discussion of 
the intra-mural idea and disclosed the 
fact that the tendency of the modern 
college is to take this matter ser­
iously.
Coach Steffen was active during the 
conference upon the matter of the 
1915 Football Schedule, and his wide 
acquaintanceship and popularity 
among the representatives, helped in 
a very large measure toward solving 
the problem. He is an optimist, 
when you mention 1915 Football at 
Tech and predicts some things, the 
realization of which, should make all 
Tech men glad. He was keen for 
news from Tech, and asked that the 
writer say “Hello!” to every Tech 
man for him.
Fred. E. Foster.
CARNEGIE TO MEET PITT
Coniinued from Page 1 
taneous outbreak, but was a typical 
demonstration of the Tech spirit. We 
want every loyal student to remem­
ber that there is going to be a game 
with Pitt Friday night, and that he 
is going to be present to do his share 
to put the contest on the right side 
of the ledger for Tech.
Pitt expects a big turnout from 
their student body and we expect the 
same from ours. Let’s work up a 
little spirit for this game, fellows; 
talk about the contest and get the 
other fellows interested. We must 
win and start the 1915 athletic year 
in the right direction. Don’t forget 
at Trees gmynasium, Center avenue 
and Aliquippa street, Friday night at 
8 p. m. Forget her for this night and 
be a real sport and come out and sup­
port the team.
There will be a preliminary game 
to the big contest, Tech Plebes meet­
ing the Pitt Freshmen. It might be 
said that on the last meeting between 
these two teams, the 1915 Science 
Plebes won an 18-15 victory; so there 
is one contest Pitt did not win in 
addition to several others that Tech 
has won in track and baseball. The 
two Tech teams will probably be 
picked from the following men: Hines, 
Douthett, Meredith, Henning, Levy, 
Curtis, Marshall, Holzworth, Fisher, 
Kelly, Hobbs, Slater, Green, Sea- 
graves, Kreider, Kesner, and Fletcher. 
Hines will probably lead the team in 
place of Tumpane, who has with­
drawn.
Saturday night, January 9th, at our
gymnasium, Tech will meet Geneva 
College in the first home game. There 
will be a dance following the con­
test and Manager Boyer is preparing 
to handle a large crowd. Geneva will 
bring back to us two old Tech favor­
ites, Metheny and Park, both of whom 
did so much for us athletically while 
here at Tech. Everyone who ever 
saw these men perform know what 
the above statement means. It will 
be Parks’ last time to oppose us at 
Tech, and we should not forget to re­
mind him Saturday that his efforts 
while under our banner were appre­
ciated. Last year’s games with Ge­
neva were both close, Tech being re­
turned the winner in each case. We 
hope and expect the game will start 
promptly at 8:15.
MR. JANSON PLAYS IN 
CONCERT.
On Wednesday evening, December 
30, in Carnegie Music Hall, a concert 
was given by the Musicians’ Club of 
Pittsburgh in honor of the Music 
Teachers’ National Association. The 
soloists were Hougard Nielson, tenor; 
Theodore Rentz, violinist, and Wil­
liam H. Oetting, organist. The pian­
ists included Dallmeyer Russell, Sel- 
mar Janson and Carl Whitmer. The 
Saudek Ensemble also participated in 
the program.
Mr. Janson is a member of the 
faculty of the Department of Music of 
the Design School. With Theodore 
Rentz, violinist, and Domenico Capu- 
to, clarinetist, he played Mason’s 
“Pastoral.” The song “A Little Flow­
er”, sung by Mr. Nielson, was com­
posed by Mr. Janson.
ALUMNI NOTES.
S. A. Scholl, Jr., Mining, ’10, vis­
ited here during the holidays. He is 
now a junior in mining engineering 
at Columbia University, with the op­
portunity of going to the Russian oil 
fields after graduation.
D. D. Mitchell, ’13, former editor-in- 
chief of The Tartan, stopped over in 
Pittsburgh a few days last week on 
his way to the Pacific coast, where he 
is being sent on government work.
The Mahoning and Shenango Val­
ley Chapter of the Alumni Associa­

FOR5First Social Function of Science Third 
Year Class a Success.
On Tuesday evening before the 
Christmas vacation, December 15, 
Carnegie Union on the top floor of 
the Central Building staged an infor­
mal dance given by the Science Jun­
iors in preparation for their Prom. 
The expectations of its promoters 
were realized, for several of the Jun­
iors made their first try at the new 
dances on this occasion. The attend­
ance of nearly forty couples shows, 
too, that all the class needs toward a 
strong social life is a start.
The committee in charge with Hines 
as chairman arranged to have the 
lights on until after twelve o’clock, 
considerably later than the regular 
“lights out” time. This committee 
deserves the thanks of all Juniors for 
the music and other arrangements 
which they made, having only the 
small assessment of fifty cents a 
couple to work with.
When forty Juniors will venture 
out on a night below zero with their 
fair ones and then all wish for some 
more, it seems that the time is ripe 
for “some more”.
AND THEY DID MEASURE 
LIGHTS.
And it came to pass that as the days 
progressed there was urgent need to 
go forth and measure lights.
And the most high and supreme 
“Prof.” did say:
“Go to and choose from among thy- 
selves seven tried and trusty ones that 
they may go forth in the dead of the 
night to do this work.”
Even as he had commanded, so was 
it done, and seven were chosen from 
these same Junior Electricals, and the 
names of these valiant ones were: 
“M. Le Due de Khakiackh”, “Etk”,
“Deak”, “Bossie”, “Hilarious”, “Hand­
some Artur” and “Wohlgie”.
And on the evening of the first day 
they, everyone, did convene and did 
get themselves ready for the fray.
And right so did they depart and 
come to the bridge, and the wind 
roared with anger that these sturdy 
ones should dare his might, and blew 
with renewed vigor.
Even so they proceeded and came 
upon a quiet lane, by name, Mawhin- 
ney, and did essay to measure there­
on.
But the wind was keen and while 
two did manipulate the wagon, sun­
dry others did execute certain evolu­
tions on the snow mantled earth that 
caused many to pause astounded, 
thinking it was an exhibition of a new 
dance or such like.
And many seeing M. le Due did 
wonder at the audacity of certain men 
in certain places whereby such as this 
was allowed to roam about untram­
meled by their espionage.
And so they progressed ever onward 
until they did arrive at the crossroads, 
which same in common parlance is 
Bayard and Dithridge.
And “Etts” being as it were en­
thused with his work, did wish to 
measure the lights on an auto, thereby 
almost causing the wrecking of all 
plans.
Right so did they proceed up this 
road called Dithridge until they, from 
sheer fatigue, stopped at the house of 
joy whereupon all proceeded to induce 
some warmth in their pedals.
After a sojourn here of a few (?) 
minutes, the valiant seven did proceed 
to the exponent of the modern illumi­
nation in the “Bellefield Apartments.”
Because of the fact that “Deak” had 
picked up a straw lid on the way up 
and was wearing it, the warder of the 
gate refused the seven admittance, 
proposing in its stead to call up the 
keeper to take charge of M. le Due 
and of “Deak”.
This being not in the plans, they did 
suddenly depart to the “Boulevard” 
where after sundry adventures and 
episodes they did proceed home.
And M. le Due de Khakiakh did sol­
emnly swear that never again would 
he tempt the gods as they had re­
warded his earnest efforts (?) by a 
frost bite in the feet.
And except for the above they ar­
rived safely home well content with 
their achievements.
SENIOR-PLEBE SMOKER.
The Plebe class of the Applied Sci­
ence School gave a very enjoyable 
smoker in honor of the Senior class 
on Thursday evening, December 18th, 
in the Carnegie Union. The Senior 
Plebe smoker is fast becoming a tra­
dition, and as such lived up to the 
success which it scored in former 
years.
The evening’s entertainment opened 
with a grand march, the Seniors act­
ing as the gentler sect. Upon the 
conclusion of the grand march a 
very informal stag dance took place. 
Possibly according to Noah Web­
ster’s “Bridge Dictionary” it should 
properly have been termed a “rough 
house,” but, however that may b$ 
everybody greatly enjoyed it, and 
called for several encores.
Singing of popular, and school 
songs followed, after which many at­
tractive forms of entertainment were 
exhibited, the most interesting of 
which were the paper fights. Paper 
fights may not sound dangerous, or 
interesting, but my, you should just 
see one. It is in fact the next best 
thing to a good old fashioned prize 
fight.
The beanery then furnished the 
next entertainment in the shape of 
a very inviting buffet supper. After 
the supper had concluded, President 
Martel extended a few words of wel­
come to the Seniors, thanking them 
for the attitude and attention they 
had accorded the class. Short 
speeches, and a few new and very in­
teresting new stories were then given 
by Balsinger, Sheldon, Rauh, Hant- 
man, Cunningham, and Cline, of the 
Senior class. Following this a short 
vaudeville program by “Socks” Price 
concluded the evening’s entertain­
ment.

RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS 
in the
ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT 
STATION 
University of Illinois 
Urbana-Champaign, Illinois.
To extend and strengthen the field 
of its graduate work in engineering, 
the University of Illinois has since 
1907 maintained ten Research Fellow­
ships in the Engineering Experiment 
Station. These fellowships, for each 
of which there is an annual stipend 
of $500.00, are open to graduates of 
approved American and foreign uni­
versities and technical schools. Ap­
pointments to these fellowships are 
made and must be accepted for two 
consecutive collegiate years, at the 
expiration of which period, if all re­
quirements have been met, the Mas­
ter’s degree will be granted. Not 
more than half of the time of the Re­
search Fellows is required in connec­
tion with the work of the department 
to which they are assigned, the re­
mainder of the time being available 
for graduate study.
Nominations to fellowships, accom­
panied by assignments to special de­
partments of the Engineering Experi­
ment Station, are made from appli­
cations received by the Director of 
the Station each year not later than 
the first day of February. These nom­
inations are made within the month 
of February by the Station Staff, sub­
ject to the approval of the Faculty of 
the Graduate School and the Presi­
dent of the University. Appointments 
are made in March, and they take ef­
fect the first day of the following Sep­
tember. Vacancies may be filled by 
similar nominations and appointments
at other times.
Nominations to these fellowships 
are based upon the character, schol­
astic attainments, and promise of suc­
cess in the principal line of study or 
research to which the candidate pro­
poses to devote himself. Preference 
is given those applicants who have 
had some practical Engineering ex­
perience following their undergradu­
ate work.
The Engineering Experiment Sta­
tion, an organization within the Col­
lege of Engineering, was established 
in 1903 for the purpose of carrying 
on investigations in the various 
branches of engineering, and for the 
study of problems of importance to 
engineers and to the manufacturing 
and industrial interests of the State. 
Research work may be undertaken in 
architecture, architectural engineering, 
chemistry, civil engineering, electrical 
engineering, mechanical engineering, 
mining engineering, municipal and 
sanitary engineering, physics, railway 
engineering, and in theoretical and ap­
plied mechanics.
The work of the Station is closely 
related to that of the College of En­
gineering, and the Heads of Depart­
ments in the College constitute the 
administrative Station Staff. Investi­
gations are carried on by the mem­
bers of the staff and other members 
of the instructional force of the Col­
lege of Engineering, by special in­
vestigators employed by the Station, 
and by the Research Fellows.

THE GRAND.
High lights of vaudeville and musi­
cal comedy will be touched all through 
the program in the Grand Opera 
House next week beginning Monday 
afternoon, January 11. B. A. Rolfe, 
who has produced many musical com­
edies, will present “The Bride Shop”, 
an operetta by Fred De Gressac. It 
is in one act—this dashing story of 
the bride who jilted an excitable and 
jealous baron—and is told with a co­
hesive coherency and consistency of 
plot action worthy of a full-fledged 
opera or musical comedy. Besides, 
it has a cast of thirteen splendid play­
ers, including Andrew Tombes and 
Lola Wentworth. Mr. Rolfe has com­
posed the music and admirably suited 
the score to the book, while Charles 
McKenna has added a lyrical embroid­
ery that is wittily brilliant. Remem­
bering the delights of Ye Colonial 
Septet, “The Arcadians”, “The Lead­
ing Lady”, The Rolfonians and The 
Courtiers one must therefore regard 
the coming of “The Bride Shop” as an 
event of theatrical, musical and so­
cial importance. So, too, is the en­
gagement of Miss Fanny Brice, the 
spirited comedienne of the Ziegfeld 
“Follies”. Miss Brice is a character 
comedienne with a wonderfully flex­
ible and resilient voice. She has se­
cured a group of exclusive songs 
which she is using this season in most 
effective manner. They depart from 
the conventional paths both of song- 
writing and song interpretation, for
