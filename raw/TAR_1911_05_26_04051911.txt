PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1911No. 25
RECEPTION FOR MR. CARNEGIE
Carnegie Music Hall, April 27th, at 8 P. M.
Mr Carnegie has expressed his intention of visiting 
Pittsburgh the last week in April and has also ex­
pressed the desire that he might at that time have 
the opportunity of meeting and coming into a more 
personal contact with the student body than he has 
had on either of his previous visits. Mr. Carnegie 
will be the guest of the Alumni Association for a part 
of his stay here and it is at present the intention of 
those in charge to hold some sort of a reception for 
the Founder, at which he will have his desired op­
portunity to see the student body together. The 
exact nature the reception will take has not yet 
been fully decided upon. There are two general 
plans proposed: first, that a mass meeting be held 
at which Mr. Carnegie be present; second, that Mr. 
Carnegie walk through the buildings and see the 
students at work. The Tartan most decidedly favors 
the first mentioned plan. First, we feel that it would 
be considerably less strain on Mr. Carnegie than the 
walking through the buildings and, second, because 
by having a huge mass meeting Mr. Carnegie can 
meet and see more of the students than he other wise 
could. In connection with the arrangements, the 
Tartan makes the following suggstions:
That the entire student body together with the 
members of the Faculty and Alumni Association as­
semble in Carnegie Music Hall, the Glee and Choral 
Clubs being grouped together in the front of the Hall, 
That an address of welcome and appreciation be 
made by the President of the Alumni Association 
and that at the same time a set of resolutions signed
by every member of the student body be given to 
Mr. Carnegie.
That Mr. Carnegie be asked to make a short ad­
dress.
That the Glee and Choral Clubs together with the 
students sing a few selected songs and the reception 
then be declared over, all remaining standing until 
Mr. Carnegie and his party have left the hall.
It seems to us that the simpler the affair is made, 
the better it will be. We do not think that Mr. Car­
negie should be called upon to go through the try­
ing ordeal of a long reception and the arduous task 
of shaking the hands of two thousand or so persons. 
In suggesting that a set of resolutions signed by each 
and every student be given we feel that such a gift 
would be perhaps the most pleasing way in which 
we could show the Founder our gratitude for his 
benevolences. We believe that such a mark of our 
love and respect would be more appropriate than any 
other one thing it is within our power to do. This 
would then become one of his historical documents 
with the names always coupled with the early days 
of this institution.
In regard to the seating arrangements, we would 
suggest that a certain section be set aside for the 
members of the Faculty and of the Alumni and that 
the balance of the house be thrown open to the stud­
ent body at large.
Also that at about ten minutes before the time set 
for the arrival of Mr. Carnegie any seats remaining 
in the second balcony be opened to such parents of the

students as might desire to attend. It also seems 
to us, we might here well remark, that every student 
is duty bound to attend this reception and if the en­
tire student body does as it should there,will be no 
seats remaining.
The date now set for the reception by Mr. Carnegie 
is Thursday, April 27th, at 8 o'clock in the evening. 
Let every student remember the date, keep it free, 
and attend this reception.
STUDENT SENATE IN POLITICS
What a factor a student senate might become in 
our school life is shown by recent happenings in 
Ohio Wesleyan and Case Tech. The senate of Ohio 
Wesleyan wrote the Case Senate requesting that 
a petition, signed by the teaching staff and student 
body of Case, be sent to the Ohio Legislature, for 
the defeat of section 4867 of Senate Bill 65 which 
would disfranchise all students who came into Ohio 
or a county thereof for the purpose merely of at­
tending school, academy, college, university or other 
institution of learning. Such a petition is now about 
ready for the Ohio Legislature.
Here is a matter of vital importance to Ohio col­
lege men which will be dealth with by them thru 
the medium of their senates.
P. R. R. ESTABLISHES AN APPRENTICE SCHOOL
The Pennsylvania Railroad Company has recently 
established a school for apprentices at its shops in 
Altoona, Pa. Co-operation being had with the engi­
neering School of Pennsylvania State Callege. The 
object is to make the apprentices in the company’s 
shops better artisans by giving to them a knowledge 
of the fundamentals of mathematics, mechanics and 
drawing.
The field thus entered by this big railroad is a 
large one and one which has grown rapidly of late. 
This growth comes only with the feeling of the need 
for training of this sort and the pioneers in the field 
have been followed with avidity. The work offered 
in most of these schools has in view the training of 
men for a particular line of work, as is the case 
with the P. R. R., and the courses offered are not 
therefore, as broad as those offered in the School of 
Applied Industries.
PROF. JAMES APPOINTED MEMBER OF 
COMMITTEE
Prof J. H. James, head of the Chemical Engin­
eering departmènt has been appointed a member of 
the organizing committee for the 8th International 
Congress of Applied Chemistry, which will be held 
in Washington and New York City, September 4-13, 
1912, under the patronage of the President of the 
United States. The last congress was held in Lon­
don.
ANNOUNCEMENT CONCERNING THE OBTAIN­
ING OF TICKETS FOR THE RECEPTION
Announcement has been made elsewhere in this is­
sue, that Mr. Carnegie wishes to meet and address 
the students en masse during his visit to Pittsburgh 
for the Founder’s Day exercises.
The time for this gathering to greet Mr. and Mrs. 
Carnegie has been set for 8 o’clock Thursday even­
ing, April 27th, and the place will be the Carnegie 
Music Hall in the Institute.
The entire orchestra floor and the first balcony 
will be reserved for students, and the second balcony 
for the parents or friends of the students.
A program for the event is now being arranged; 
it will be printed in the Tartan that is issued on 
April 19th.
A ticket will be required for entrance. These 
tickets can now be obtained by applying in person 
or by letter at the Registrar’s Office, Room 115 of 
the Industries Building. It is planned to give each 
student three tickets, one for himself and two for 
parents or friends, but this method of distribution 
will depend upon the number of students who apply.
As the number of tickets to be issued for parents 
will be affected by the number of students who sig­
nify their intention of being present, it is therefore 
requested that applications be made at once. The 
work of the committee on seating arrangements 
will thus be greatly facilitated.
ARCHITECTS DISPORT THEMSELVES
One day last week the architects decided, with 
characteristic abandonment, that they needed a rest 
together with a little excitement. Perhaps singing 
“Jungletown” so much the previous week had worn 
them out. But be that as it was, they found in two 
of their members lambs willing to be lead to the 
slaughter for the comon good. It was decided by the 
committee in charge to have a real live wrestling 
bout. They did. The morning was spent in mak' 
ing the poor lambs indulged in “work out” tactics, 
while their managers and seconds issued bulletins, 
and made bets on the side.
At 2.30 both the goat and the ba ba declared them­
selves confident of victory, to be down to weight, 
the whole party then departing for the gym. Much 
noise, much fight. The goat won after a prolonged 
(purposely) struggle and the customary statements 
were issued. The architects departed on their weary 
way refreshed.
PROMINENT VISITORS OF THE WEEK
Among the visitors at the Institution last week 
were President- Drinker of Lehigh University, Mr. 
W. E. Bragdon, instructor at the University of Chi­
cago, Dr. Steitz, Exchange Professor at Chicago, 
from Prussian University, and Dr. H. H. Kendall of 
the Harvard Medical School.

DIRECTOR HAMERSCHLAG SPEAKS TO IN­
DUSTRY
“Choosing a Vocation” His Subject
Last Monday morning Director Hamerschlag 
spoke to the students of Applied Industries, taking 
for his subject, “The Choosing of a Vocation.” The 
Director said in part:
“No moment is so important in the life of a stu­
dent as that in which he finally selects his vocation. 
There is also no other event that the Faculty views 
with more eagerness and concern than this selection. 
The whole of the first year’s work is done with the 
thought that the student needs an opportunity to 
look into the various vocational and professional 
fields before making up his mind which one offers 
the greatest appeal.
“Three influences are of the most importance in 
the selection, first, and the least important, hered­
ity; second, of slightly more importance, his envi­
ronment before entering the schools and third, his 
love for and interest in certain subjects which are 
either taught or explained to him during the early 
period of his school life. This last ought to have 
the greatest effect because it comes after the first 
two have had a chance to influence the final selec­
tion.
“There is no particular advantage in one career 
over another in so far as possible success and com­
pensation is concerned, as a matter of fact, profes­
sions are poorer paid than most industrial positions 
of importance. The great captains of industries in 
our present day have reaped a larger financial re­
ward than is likely to fall to the lot of any profes­
sional men. Therefore, the student ought to con­
sciously forget the rate per day in seeking to find 
that field of work which offers him the most satis­
factory outlook from the standpoint of his interest. 
Choose that career in that field which you love most. 
Master your subject while mastering yourself. Teach 
yourself to carry more than the burden which is ex­
pected of you and you need have no hesitation in 
looking forward to a fruitful career.
“Do not think that only through education such as 
is given in our schools and colleges can a man rise. 
The three leading citizens of Pittsburgh never stud­
ied in a college. They are: Dr. John A. Brashear, 
Mr. George Westinghouse and Mr. William McCon- 
way.
“Do not think that you need a college training to 
get social recognition or power, or influence in your 
community. All of these come to every man irre­
spective of his vocation or profession if he has the 
quality. I do not know how I can emphasize suf­
ficiently the importance of your individual develop­
ment along the lines of greatest charm and inter­
est to you. It is your only chance to satisfactorily 
solve for yourselves the great problem of useful citi­
zenship. Try for yourselves to meet the demand
which is a part of the spirit of the times when em­
ployers must have capable assistants.
“The specifications you must fill can also be 
grouped under three heads:
First: Ability to work with other men.
Second: Ginger.
Third: Experience.
“The first equips a man to do things for himself as 
well as to handle other men; the scond is a combi­
nation physical and mental and is the chief antago­
nist of the microbe of laziness. The third is what we 
in school call knowledge and when dignified by the 
title “experience,” means a kind of wisdom which has 
been put into practical use by its possessor.”
MANAGER SCOTT HELD UP
On last Friday afternoon a bunch of the huskiest 
men in the schools were seen climbing the three 
flights of stairs to the Junior Chemical laboratory. 
They walked on padded feet and spoke with bated 
breath, and Sherlocko was heard to observe that 
foul deeds were about to be done. Whereupon, Dr. 
Watso murttered, “Strange.”
A stern summons was beaten upon the sacred por­
tal. Seven-foot Brown thrust his scholastic dome 
through a narrow aperture and in a voice of thunder 
inquired, “Was ist?” The chief villain demanded 
the immediate presence of one Donald M. Scott, 
once manager of a foot ball team, and the victim 
was led trembling forth.
He was at once surrounded by the besieging 
force and inflicted with a speech by one Thos. Eng- 
strom, master of ceremonies, and finally presented 
with a handsome seal ring. From Mr. Engstrom’s 
speech it was gathered that the foot ball squad of 
the past season had secured the ring as a token of 
appreciation of the manner in which “Scotty” had 
mananged the team and its affairs, and as a sign 
of their good-will, presented it to him with wishes 
for the best that an engineer’s life can provide. The 
orator was backed by Captains Hatcher and Tay- 
lor and ^ large part of the squad.
Manager Scott responded in short and rather 
breathless speech that covered all that could be 
said under the circumstances. After a general ses­
sion of handshaking, the conspirators departed with­
out attempting to cover their trails.
Plans are now under discussion for the con- * 
4j struction of a building which will be devoted 4j 
to student quarters, with an Assembly Room, * 
t etc. It is possible that accommodations can * 
4| be made for the different student activities.
4* Any suggestions which those concerned have 4* 
% in mind in regard to necessary space to be de- | 
voted to such uses should be made to the Sec- J 
retary’s office at an early moment. 4*

FIRST GAME OF BASE BALL SATURDAY
The first game of the base ball season will be 
played on Tech field on Saturday afternoon, April
8, between the new ’Varsity and the Alumni teams. 
The undergraduate team has not yet been selected, 
but a good part of the squad will probably be given 
trials.
The Alumni nine is captained by Bruce Lytle, who 
commanded the ’Varsity in 1907. Halferty, captain 
in ’08 and Coldren, the chief of ’09 and ’10, will also 
be seen in the line-up. The whole team will be made 
up of all the stars of the past five seasons who are 
within reach of the caii issued by the grads, and 
the hopefuls of the new season will have an ex­
cellent opportunity to measure up with speedy men.
The men named by Captain Lytle as probable 
players on the Alumni team, are:
Mason or Barclay, catcher; Hammond, pitcher; 
Leety, first base; Lytle, second base; Ilnhauser, 
short-stop; Coldren, third base; Halferty, left field;
Coach McCulloch will have a heavy job selecting 
nine men to represent the students from the sixty 
men now on the squad, but it is hoped that a few 
days of out-door practice this week will weed out 
the weak ones.
The alumni intend coming to the game in a body, 
and it is up to the students to turn out en masse and 
out-root the departed ones. Student tickets will be 
honored at the gate without extra charge, and the 
excuse, “Broke,” will not go.
During next week the new nine will invade Mor­
gantown and play two games with the University of 
West Virginia on Friday and Saturday.

TRACK SCHEDULE
May 6—Inter-School Meet, Tech Field.
May 13—Dual Meet with West Virginia, Tech Field. 
May 20—Pitt Inter-Collegiate Meet, Schenley Oval. 
June 3—Western Penna. Inter-Collegiate Meet, 
Grove City.
Manager McCorkle announces the above schedule 
for the track season. The first event will be of the 
greatest interest to the students, as it gives vent to 
the athletic rivalry between the three men’s schools. 
In order to make it of interest to the high schools 
and prep schools of this district, and to their follow­
ers, an innovation in the way of an inter-prep school 
meet has been arranged. If successful, this will be 
made an annual affair.
The Inter-Collegiate meets held on Schenley Oval 
by the University of Pittsburg have always had 
special interest for Tech athletes in the past, and 
this year’s will be no exception according to re­
ports from Pitt.
The Inter-Collegiate Western Pennsylvania Meet 
at Grove City will be the great event of the season 
and the team will concentrate on winning the cham­
pionship this year.
Out-door work will be taken up regularly as soon 
as the field dries. A new cinder path has been laid 
and everything is in readiness for the track enthu- 
asts.
THOUGHTFUL GIRL
The young man was calling on the girl. He didn’t

He wanted to call again the next night, but hardly

“I’d like to come up again,” he said, when he was 
ready to go home. “How about next week some 
time?”
A look of disappointment came over her face. 
“Next week?” she said. “Why, isn’t that—er—well, 
I’ll tell you what to do; you come up tomorrow 
night and we’ll decide which night next week you 
may call.—Detroit Times.

There will be no issue of the Tartan next week 
on account, of the vacations then being held.
The cover design is the work of Miss Mildred F. 
Taber of the School of Applied Design and it received 
fourth place in the recent competition.
Prof. Mott has just returned from a pleasant and 
interesting trip to the “Panama Canal Zone.” A full 
account of his journey will appear in our next issue.
The Senior statistics are once more held up owing 
to the inability of the Senior Class to reach decisions 
upon certain points. It is thought that by the end of 
the week the returns will be complete and they will
be published in the first issue of the Tartan after 
spring recess.
The Tartan takes great pleasure in announcing 
the appointment of Mr.C. E. Moss of the School of 
Applied Design to the Editorial Staff. Mr. Moss 
has from time to time contributed his well known 
cartoons to the Tartan and will from now on make 
these a weekly feature.
The last two of the Thursday morning lectures 
given to Science men have been marked with such 
discourtesy to the speakers of the morning that the 
Tartan feels that it must call attention to the oc- 
curances. The men who have so kindly offered to 
come and speak before the students are doing so 
without any renumeration and come as guests of 
the institution. They come, moreover, at a personal 
sacrifice of time which is no inconsiderable item 
to men of their position and prominence. To them 
is due all the courtesy and consideration that can 
be shown.
The discourtesy has been most plainly shown by 
talking, working, and the reading of papers and 
books. It has also been noticed that by far the great­
er part of these annoyances come from members of 
the Plebe Class. Dean Leete has already announced 
that he would accept the excuse of any man who 
did not care to attend these lectures on account of 
having work to do. For those other men who have 
persisted in making themselves a nuisance to those 
around them and in showing discourtesy to the in­
stitutions guests, the Tartan would recommend that 
either they be kept away from the lectures alto­
gether or that they be made to conduct themselves 
as gentlemen and Tech men.

AN UNFORTUNATE EXAMPLE
To a young man who stood smoking a cigar the 
other day there approached the elderly and imper­
tinent reformer of immemorial legend.
“How many cigars do you smoke a day?” asked 
the meddler.
“Three,” answered the youth, as patiently as he 
could.
“How much do you pay for them?”
“Ten cents,” confessed the young man.
“Don’t you know, sir,” continued the sage, “that 
u you would save that money, by the time you are as 
old as I am you could own that big building over the 
way ?”
“Do you own it?” inquired the smoker.
“No.”
“Well, I do,” said the young man.—Tobacco 
Leaves.

THE TARTAN »
April 3, 1911.
To the Editor:—Education as it stands today, is 
of such a varied nature, and is so extensive and so 
readily accessible, that we are very apt to lose sight 
of the fundamental principles of this art. With 
the opportunity for receiving an education placed 
within the greater proportion of men and women 
of this age, and with the wonderful desire mani­
fested by so large a percentage of persons to acquire 
an education, it is but natural that the primary ob­
jects of all educational functions should be shifted 
to a remote background in the consideration of the 
plans and purposes of those who desire to be taught 
and, in many cases, of those who desire to teach. 
It might be well, therefore, for us to pause for a 
minute in the busy rush for learning and attainment 
to inquire briefly into what our educations should 
first enable us to do and what should be the under­
lying principle of all educational programs.
First of all, education is individualization,—the 
development of the units which together comprise 
the world’s people. Educators aim to bring out of 
every student the best that is within his mental ca­
pacities, and at the same time, they attempt, so to 
mould his character and his inclinations that the 
educated man will conduct and deport himself in the 
application of his trained abilities in such a manner 
as to make his presence and his skill desired in the 
general social and communal life of his day and sur­
roundings. But this feature of the educational plan 
is but an incidental one, as compared to the greater 
problem which underlies the aim of real educators. 
The trouble too often is that both teachers and 
students conceive this development of the individual 
to be the sum and substance of all that education 
should accomplish. Students particularly form opin­
ions very frequently that their whole aim in educa­
tional pursuits should be to train their individual 
faculties and develop their own abilities without re­
gard to the relation of these features to the rest of 
the world, or so much of it as they are required to 
come into contact with in their daily lives. True 
education, however, aims to associate the units of 
the social and intellectual sphere with the collective 
body.
No education today serves its entire purpose if 
if fails to consider the collective life of the com­
munity. No system of training and culture can hope 
to succeed ultimately where stress is not laid upon 
relative values. The social, economic and industrial 
life of today is of a highly complex nature. True 
education is that which trains men and women to 
take their places in the world’s work so as to enable 
them to act THROUGH and WITH, not AGAINST, 
society and its organization. Co-operation among its 
citizens is the source of strength unto a nation, and 
no citizen can co-operate with his fellows whose edu­
cation has not equipped him to do so. It is this co­
operative and relative value of education that I de­
sire to emphasize.
From the day our boys and girls enter the public 
school until the time they graduate as young men 
and young women from technical schools and uni­
versities, the principles must always be kept before 
them that they are being educated, not so much to 
make bright men and women of themselves, as to 
enable them to take their proper places in the col­
lective mass known as the world’s people.
This aim can be accomplished to a great extent in 
school life by adding to the theoretical propounding 
of the doctrine such practical applications of it as 
the formation and maintenance of clubs, societies, 
and school organizations in general. The suggestive­
ness of the collective idea here, whether it be in the 
common desire to promote the standing of the par­
ticular club with which the student is affiliated, or in 
the unselfish habits nurtured by the union of grow­
ing pupils in the formation of such societies, will 
gradually impress upon the minds of the students 
the fact that this world is not a mere multitude of 
units, but a collective mass of men and women 
striving for a common end, the betterment of condi­
tions in general and the upliftment, of the world as a 
whole.
Of course, it is true that no collective body can 
rise higher than the sum total of its individuals in 
capacity, attainment and calibre, and for this rea­
son we should so aim to prepare ourselves that the 
standard of the whole should not be lowered because 
of .the fact that we are parts of it.
Some of us will naturally be leaders of men; but, 
all of us, by bearing in mind the ultimate purposes 
of our educational facilities and striving to carry 
them into effect,, may fit ourselves to become sol­
diers in the ranks,—soldiers of the kind that the 
world will respect.
This endeavor to unite in working out our common 
destiny, in an institution such as ours, founded on 
principles of the noblest democracy and attended 
with the incidents which these principles imply, 
should appeal to every one of us. We should feel 
the responsibility which is ours in the accomplish- 
mement of our acknowledged purposes, and with 
this assumption of responsibility should come to 
the realization that our education must train us to 
the standards of the collective social and industrial 
body, and that any movement within our school 
which tends to develop this characteristic and to 
prepare us to appreciate the relative values of our 
acquired attainments should receive our approval 
and support. Every organization, which may help 
to develop along proper dines the co-operative idea, 
should appeal to us in a way that must address itself 
to men and women who have learned to realize the 
duty of each individual so to mould his thoughts and 
habits as best to serve the common welfare and am­
bitions of the social body.

10THE TARTAN
PROF. HORNBOSTEL LECTURES
Last Thursday, Mr. Hornbostel, Dean of the school 
of Applied Design talked to the Applied Science 
School on Yucatan, where he and a college friend 
had a “skylark” on a 10 day vacation trip from New 
York.
Mr. Hornbostel was punctually late for the lecture, 
but through force of habit, the waiting students, 
who were acquainted with Mr. Hornbostel’s attitude 
with regard to punctuality, took no notice of the fact. 
Mr. Wurts, who acted as toastmaster, appeared to be 
unused to the delay and felt under the necessity of 
making several sallies in search of the speaker be­
fore capturing that elusive and fun producing indi­
vidual. Mr. Hornbostel unfortunately did not ad­
vance any excuse for being absent hence was marked 
absent of Mr. Wurts.
With regard to the kind of architecture existing 
in Yucatan, Mr. Hornbostel said that a diet of cocoa- 
nut water and eggs of various kinds was good for the 
health, also that he had given this lecture 18 times, 
17 gratis and one for $50. He said that he would not 
charge his hearers, which generous statement was re­
ceived with considerable applause and merriment.
Needless to say throughout the lecture, Mr. Horn­
bostel was very successsful in keeping his hearers 
out of a somnolent state and in great good humor 
by his really witty remarks. His talk was, unquest­
ionably, throughly enjoyed my all.
Mr. Hornbostel would have willingly continued 
his lecture beyond the allotted time but upon the 
suggestion of Mr. Wurts, who besides being toast­
master acter as timekeeper, kindly offered to continue 
his talk some other time. It is to be hoped that his 
offer will be accepted.
CARNEGIE MECHANICAL SOCIETY MEETING
Last Saturday evening the Carnegie Mechanical 
Society met and heard a lecture by Mr. S. A. Bockins, 
of the Elliott Company, on “Mechanical Cleaning 
versus Chemical Cleaning of Boilers.” Mr. Bockins 
exhibited a number of interesting samples of boiler 
tube scale formation. He also had with him several 
types of boiler tube cleaners of which he explained 
the workings.
After his talk Mr. Brockins gave a very interesting 
demonstration of boiler tube cleaning in the Mechan­
ical Laboratory. The boiler tube experimented upon 
was 4 inches in diameter and about 6 feet in length 
and was a sample of a tube taken from a water tube 
boiler.
It had a very hard scale formation inside to the 
depth of about % inch. The type of cleaner used 
was what is known as the Clyclone, it being air 
driven.
This cleaner revolves at about 5000 revolutions per 
minute with an air pressure of about 50 lbs per square 
inch and actuates a hammer which raps the scale 
off very effectively.
Mr. Hobbs, when informri that ihe machine’s
maximum speed was 8000 revolutions per minute, 
became instantly from Missouri and insisted on test­
ing speed of the machine.
Unfortunately for the Sophomore Mechanicals, 
“the gol darned thing” went so fast that it “bust” the 
tachometer and instantly played havoc with the 
breakage fees of these gentlemen.
In the business session of the meeting Mr. Barch- 
field of the club room committee gave an estimate 
on the cost of furnishing the club room, also a list 
of the furniture to be used for same. It appears that 
the Society is going to have a nice club room.
Refreshments were served by the local purvey­
ors, Messrs. Stearns and Bigelow, assisted by the 
sub-purveyors, Messrs. Wright, Schweitzer and Ful­
mer of the Sophomore class.
A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION
In Mr. Leo Weil’s Micawber-Heep like denuncia­
tion of Mayor Magee, made recently, he mentioned 
that a prominent detective had been in the city late­
ly for a day on business, who made the startling 
statement to him that he had never seen such a 
large number of ruffianly-looking people, whose faces 
are in every rogues’ gallery, as he saw on the streets 
of Pittsburgh.
It is very unfortunate for the city’s reputation 
that the Junior Mechanicals were downtown taking 
in the sights the very day this detective was making 
iris observation, because he, no doubt, must have 
seen these gentlemen and naturally and justifiably 
based his above conclusions on the ruffiianly ap­
pearance of these gentlemen.
However, be that as it may, the Tartan would like 
to take this opportunity to vindicate Pittsburgh by 
announcing to the public that of those in this 
junior Mechanical conglomeration of iniquity who 
are most likely to come under the above category:
Mr. “Lefty” Manker is from Tarentum.
Mr. James K. Lamoree is from New Castle.
Mr. Frank Dalas is from Los Angeles.
Mr. Harry Holiday is from Norwalk...
Mr. Riedle is from Buffalo.
Mr. Kelly Walker is from Sewickley.
Mr. Alfred Ormston is from Oil City.
By some twist of the election an old negro had 
been elected to the office of justice of the peace in 
a little backwoods‘district in Tennessee. His first 
case happened to be one in which the defendant 
asked for a trial by jury. When the testimony 
was all in, the lawyers waited for the judge to give 
his instructions to the jury. The new justice seemed 
embarrassed. Finally one of the lawyers whispered 
to him that it was time to charge the jury. He web- 
stered one hand in front of his coat, calhouned his 
voice, and said:
“Gent’m’n ob de jury, sence dis am a putty small 
case, Ah’ll on’y charge yo’ a dollah ’n’ a half apiece.”

This School has been granted their Spring Vaca­
tion a week earlier than the other schools due to 
the fact that next week is Class “B” Charrette. The 
current problems “A Town Hall” and “Peristyle with 
Porch and Porticos” being due Monday, April 17th.
The fourth Class “A” project of this school year 
was forwarded to the Society of Beaux Arts Arch­
itects for exhibition and judgment, for last Monday, 
March 27th. The subject of the projet was “A Thea­
tre” and proved to be a very interesting as well as 
a practical problem. The students with the criticism 
of the professors turned out some excellent results 
at the judgment.
The Archaeology Problem “A Chapel Screen” in 
the Gothic style was also submitted with the Class 
“A.” There were ten complete drawings for the 
Class “A” Projet and also ten Archaeology problems.
Programmes for the fifth Class “A” preliminary 
sketch, “A Stock Exchange” and the Class “B” Es- 
quisse-Esquisse “A Riding School” were given out 
Saturday, April 1st at 2 p. m., and rendered the 
same day at 11 p. m.
The Official Report of the last Class “B” judgment 
held by the Society of Beaux Arts Architects has 
been received and is given below:

SCHOLASTIC RANKING OF ATHLETICS.
Statistics on the scholarships of the members of 
the varsity athletic teams at Princeton indicate that 
the scholastic ranking of athletes is practically the 
same as that of the undergraduate body as a whole; 
in other words, that membersship on a varsity team 
neither improves or lowers the average of scholar­
ship.
The members of the tennis team make the best 
showing, followed by track, hockey, baseball, foot­
ball and golf, in the order named. The average of all 
of this group is 3.32 which is a little about the aver­
age for the entire student body.

Mr. Pfouts. Lord of the Patterns, has a huge store 
of philosophic sayings. Here are a few of them:
“Things that come to those who wait are the 
things that no one else wants.”
“A fellow who loves work for work’s sake generally 
is abnormally inmaginative.”
“Ring out the bells for the chap who frankly dis­
likes work but who nevertheless works his head off 
with a song in his heart because it is a part of the 
game.”
“You may be able to give a good invitation of a 
man thinking but can you deliver the goods.”
A sharp thrust—This is a quotation from a Con­
necticut woman’s diary, dated 1790: “We had roast 
pork for dinner; and Dr. S., who carved, held up a 
rib on his fork and said: ‘Here, ladies, is what Moth­

from very much the same kind of critter.’ ”—The
