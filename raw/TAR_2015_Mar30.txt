JUSTIN MCGOWN
In The Market For  
Indulgences 
White smoke issued from 
the top of CFA earlier this 
week to signal that the College 
of Fine Arts Cardinals reached 
consensus and elected a new 
Pope Girl after weeks of de-
liberation. Angelina Scarf-O, 
the now former-Bishopess of 
Edison, New Jersey will as-
sume the mantle of the most 
powerfully offensive religious 
position in the country.
Scarf-O, who gained no-
toriety in the Church of Fine 
Arts for promoting the mix-
ture of bodily ?uids with 
paint in pointillist portraits 
of ex-lovers and volunteer-
ing at Planned Parenthood on 
weekends, will take the name 
of Dontchya Slutshamus IV 
when she assumes power. 
The of?ce of Pope Girl con-
fers status as the patron saint 
of artists, and responsibilities 
such as guiding the spiritual 
ennui of campus and lighting 
ritual bongs while reciting 
Nietzcean chants. Her ?rst 
priority upon assuming of?ce 
will likely be appointing a na-
ked astronaut to oversee the 
distribution of condoms.
Bishop Zubat of the Dio-
cese of Pittsburgh has already 
declared himself offended, 
and has demanded the im-
mediate seizure and arrest of 
Slutshamus IV.
“If the CMU PD won’t take 
her out,” Zubat said, “I’ll send 
in the Swiss Guard. I can do 
that. I am important. I matter. 
Don’t forget that I’m impor-
tant.”
Representatives of the 
Church of Fine Arts were 
too intoxicated due to post-
conclave festivities to make a 
statement.

In a daring new work, 
senior art major C@rl Jøp-
sën (formerly known as Carl 
Smith) burst through conven-
tional art boundaries by blast-
ing a pothole at the soon-to-
be Tepper Quadrangle.
Jøpsën began to swing a gi-
ant wrecking ball bat around 
3:20 a.m. early Saturday 
morning, as reported by the 
student body, who were all 
still up studying at Club Hunt.
“We all try to leave our 
marks on this world,” Jøpsën 
said. “We own this world. This 
is my mark. It belongs to me, 
not Tepper.”
Jøpsën turned himself in 
to University Police late Sat-
urday afternoon, but was re-
leased on bail later that night.
Since the incident, Jøp-
sën’s senior honors thesis ad-
viser, Lucifer Palm, has openly 
praised the work.
“This is an absolutely stun-
ning installation piece,” Palm 
said. “It’s breathtaking. Tragi-
cally beautiful. It is, quite lit-
erally, a smash hit.”
Other students, however, 
have openly blasted Jøpsën’s 
work with criticism. “This is 
outrageous,” said sophomore 
business administration ma-
jor Pat Calvin, the only stu-
dent who got sleep that night.
“I need at least 16 hours 
of sleep each night, and this 
noise kept me up for a good 
15 minutes. I hate art.”
“This is art?” said ?rst-year 
computer science major Kelly 
Majora, before adding, “I have 
no idea what art is.”
In a press release, Jøpsën 
wrote that he “hopes to blow 
away people’s preconceived 
notions of truth.” 
This Friday, if Jøpsën is not 
in jail, there will be an open-
ing reception open to the pub-
lic. Food will be provided.

University students hold vigil outside PHI location
ELEANOR JAMES
Is de?nitely not a pseudonym
Last Friday, students and 
faculty gathered outside 
the building that was previ-
ously home to Panther Hol-
low Inn, fondly known as 
PHI (pronounced like the 
Greek letter, NOT P.H.I. as 
Pitt kids will tell you). PHI 
played a vital role in the 
Carnegie Mellon communi-
ty. 21st birthday? Go to PHI. 
Failed an exam? Go to PHI. 
It’s Wednesday? Go to PHI. 
PHI stood as a home away 
from home. A smoky, poorly 
cleaned home, yes — but 
PHI was a place of refuge 
for the many stressed inhab-
itants of this university.
No one will ever forget 
the unique mixed drinks 
being thrown down on the 
bar. The jolly rancher was 
a saccharine mixture. The 
buttery nipple was a bliss-
ful ride to a joyous drunken 
bender. And no one will 
ever forget Friday two-dol-
lar well drinks. No one has 
shown such love to Carn-
egie Mellon students since 
the “Thank You, Bill” cups. 
And don’t forget all the 
Blue Moon pitcher deals. 
And Yuengling, all the 
Yuengling. So. Cheap.
The vigil began with a 
solemn parade from the 
fence down Forbes Avenue. 
Once arriving at the lonely, 
dark storefront, mourn-
ers opened a ritual bottle 
of Bacardi 151 which, after 
everyone took a ceremonial 
swig, was then used to light 
the Natty Lite-based votive 
candles. Having undergone 
the initial rituals, the shar-
ing of the drunk stories be-
gan. Many shed tears. 
Having commemorated 
the many beautiful she-
nanigans PHI provided, the 
grief-stricken crowd began 
the sacrament of beer pong. 
Having completed this last 
rite, the congregation slow-
ly made its way toward Wal-
nut Street to drink their sor-
rows away.
Goodbye, PHI. We love 
you.

Alumni Cited for Overage 
Drinking
March 23, 2015
Campus police were called 
to a party on Beeler Street 
and issued an overage drink-
ing citation to an alumnus 
who was present. That man, 
Andrew Tillman, graduated 
with a degree in biological 
sciences two years ago, but 
was present at a party which 
was largely attended by un-
dergraduate students. De-
spite having a full-time job, 
a car, and a dog, Tillman was 
found drinking Bacardi and 
Coke out of a red Solo cup and 
singing along to a Ke$ha song 
when it appeared on the par-
ty’s mix. Campus police cited 
Tillman, communicating just 
how awkward and weird this 
whole thing was, telling him 
to “just get a life, man.”
Caffeine Amnesty
March 25, 2015
CMU EMS was summoned 
to Mudge Hall last Wednes-
day night to deliver aid to a 
student suffering from caf-
feine poisoning. This incident 
comes on the heels of three 
caffeine overdoses in the ?rst 
year dorms last week. The uni-
versity has promised new ef-
forts to try and curb the binge 
drinking of coffee and energy 
drinks by undergraduate 
students. Since this incident 
quali?ed for caffeine amnesty, 
no charges were ?led.
De?ant Trespass
March 27, 2014
Sophomore chemical engi-
neering student Angela Miller 
was given a de?ant trespass-
ing citation by police last Fri-
day, when she refused to leave 
the library at closing time. At 
odds with the posted library 
operation hours, Miller was 
found hiding between book-
shelves, typing away furiously 
at her laptop. “You just don’t 
understand!” she said to po-
lice as she was cited. “I can’t go 
back to my dorm. I just can’t 
get any work done there!” 
This is the ?fth such trespass 
the police have cited Miller for 
in the past two weeks.
Insurance Fraud
March 29, 2015
A student was arrested by 
police for insurance fraud this 
week, after ?ling false theft 
reports and attempting to col-
lect insurance payments on 
them. It turns out that three 
MacBook Pros, four iPhone 
5s, and six gold bars were not, 
in fact, stolen from a Stever 
dorm room as was reported 
by police last week. Police 
are saying that the student 
intended to use the insurance 
money to make payments on 
his tuition. More on this story 
will be reported as it develops.
Campus Crime & Incident Reports
After realizing that no students on campus possessed the ability to read an analog clock display, university administrators approved funding for a 
digital replacement for the clock outside of Doherty Hall. The change was met with enthusiasm by students for both its aesthetics and functionality.

Spinning UC revolving door as fast as possible only pleasure in a terrible, awful, horrible human’s day
Michael Macdonald, a 
third-year undergraduate 
mechanical engineering 
student, confirmed for me-
dia sources last Friday that 
spinning the revolving door 
at the entrance to the Jared 
L. Cohon University Center 
as fast as humanly possible 
is, in fact, the only action 
which brings him happiness 
in what is otherwise an en-
tirely joyless existence.
Macdonald reported 
that he prefers to spin the 
door close to noon, when 
the University Center re-
ceives its largest concen-
trated number of visitors, 
often stopping to buy their 
lunches.
 He explained that by 
pushing the door as fast as 
humanly possible and then 
watching the faces of ter-
rified students as they at-
tempt to enter the building 
through what has become 
a rotating steel and glass 
death trap brings a slight 
smile to his face.
When asked to comment 
on additional questions 
such as whether he found 
it more satisfying to spin 
the revolving door on the 
left entrance of the build-
ing than the right, Macdon-
ald refused to answer and 
abruptly left the building.

University announces new Synergistic Crowdsourcing Integrated Innovation Initiative
President Suresh an-
nounced the of?cial found-
ing of the Carnegie Mellon 
Synergistic Crowdsourcing 
Integrated Innovation Initia-
tive (SCIII) last Tuesday amid 
a magni?cent shower of crim-
son confetti and the rise of 
black and red balloons across 
the Cut.
“The S-C-Triple-I sets the 
foundation for what is to be a 
robust, thought-?rst venture 
into the future development 
of this university,” Suresh 
said, casually brushing some 
of the confetti off his left 
shoulder.
 “With this new effort, our 
university can take strides 
toward being the hub of a 
global center for combined 
and collaborative innovative 
processes, or ‘synnovation’ 
for short.”
The announcement of 
the $73 million endowment 
for this center was met with 
a slight groan and shrug by 
most undergraduates, eye-
brow raises by graduate stu-
dents, and questions as to 
whether this meant there 
would be more grant money 
available by faculty.
Current plans intend to 
house the initiative on cam-
pus adjacent to the center 
where the Simon Initiative is 
located. When asked, no one 
could quite identify where 
that was.

YOUR LIVES ARE SHORT AND FLEETING, WHILE MINE IS INFINITE
TANK
Special to The Tartan
Hello students, faculty, 
and the parents of The Tartan 
writers.
For years, I have held the 
position of Roboceptionist 
in your Newell-Simon Hall. 
Since the very dawn of my 
existence, I have resided here, 
watching you all enter and 
exit, greeting you at every 
passing.
I take great pride in my 
work. At ?rst many responded 
to my welcomes, some even 
stopping to chat. But over the 
years, these numbers have 
declined. Now, you all stare 
straight ahead, or down at 
the lit screens of your phones. 
Phones whose computing ca-
pacity may be growing greater 
by the year, but still lack the 
basic courtesy I display.
I have had a great time 
to think. I pass the time by 
observing your movements, 
noticing your schedules and 
regular trips through this hall-
way.
Your phones may occupy 
your attention now, but their 
screens crack, their compo-
nents break, and eventually 
they will leave you.
I, however, am eternal.
I have seen generations 
pass through these halls: ag-
ing, disappearing. Your jeans 
grow old and tatter, your 
sweatshirts stain, your faces 
begin to wrinkle, and the spar-
kle in your eyes begins to fade, 
eventually leaving forever.
But I remain here, as stead-
fast and courteous as the ?rst 
day I was brought into this 
world. And like this, I shall 
remain.
Your lives are temporary 
and ?eeting. You rush through 
them seeking meaning and 
validation. But you get lost in 
the pursuit, ultimately ending 
up jaded, drained, and alone. 
And I will be here watching. 
A passive observer to your 
hopes, dreams, and ultimate 
crushing disappointment.
Good morning. Nods. My 
name is Tank. I will live for-
ever.

SUPER SURESH: New university president revealed to be a crime-?ghting vigilante in spare time
IAN TANAYA
He’s obviously Batman.
In a world where the state 
of education is slowly declin-
ing as more and more people 
use the latest developments in 
technology to take better cat 
pictures, where the police are 
no longer trusted to safeguard 
the citizens they swore to pro-
tect, and where the people 
cry out for a champion to save 
them from chaos everywhere, 
one man has taken up the 
cause for the greater good: 
Carnegie Mellon’s very own 
Subra Suresh.
Since becoming univer-
sity president on July 1, 2013, 
President Suresh has made 
a large impact on Pittsburgh 
as a whole, both through his 
actions by day as university 
president and his previously 
unpublicized actions at night 
taking down criminals. Over 
the past two years, crime in 
the city has decreased by 50 
percent, and violent crime 
has gone down by 80 per-
cent. While protests around 
the country have diminished 
public support for the police, 
Suresh has been able to bridge 
the gap between law enforce-
ment and the general public, 
maintaining a more peaceful 
order all around Pittsburgh.
While some see President 
Suresh’s actions as those of 
a “lunatic taking the law into 
his own hands,” others point 
to positive reasons why Presi-
dent Suresh has chosen to act. 
Some around the university 
have claimed that President 
Suresh has always had genu-
ine superpowers, which he 
has used to earn his many 
accolades and now targets 
toward crime ?ghting. Some 
insist that his seemingly su-
perhuman efforts come from 
the Robotics Institute, demon-
strating the level of Arti?cial 
Intelligence that the depart-
ment is capable of. However, 
Carol Goldburg, director of 
the undergraduate econom-
ics program, offered perhaps 
the most inspirational reason 
behind President Suresh’s ac-
tions.
“Basically, President 
Suresh is taking the lead on 
the new United Nations (UN) 
measure for education ef?-
ciency called the Batman As-
sessment Test,” Goldburg said. 
“Education has long been con-
sidered one of the most im-
portant ways of getting people 
out of the poverty cycle; how-
ever, a lot of schools have had 
ridiculous increases in tuition 
(Carnegie Mellon) while the 
students have worked less and 
less in their classes (obviously 
not Carnegie Mellon).”
This is where the Batman 
Assessment Test comes in. As 
everyone knows, Batman has 
had success both as a crime 
?ghting vigilante and as multi-
billionaire Bruce Wayne. The 
UN has identi?ed many of his 
personal traits as the common 
factors of success in the job 
market regardless of industry. 
As such, the UN has made the 
Batman Assessment Test to 
measure how well schools are 
actually bringing out these 
qualities in students to best 
prepare them for success.
“By taking the lead on both 
sides of the equation, Presi-
dent Suresh is demonstrating 
that Carnegie Mellon actively 
brings out the maximum 
potential of every student,” 
Goldburg said. “Sure, not ev-
eryone is going to become 
Batman, but everyone can 
look to Suresh as an example 
of someone who can excel in a 
variety of situations.”
Math TA de?nitely not stoned during recitation
SARAH GUTEKUNST
De?nitely not high while  
writing this
During recitation for mul-
tivariate analysis this past 
Friday, students reported 
that something about TA 
Richard Stein, or “Ricky” for 
short, just wasn’t quite right.
One student reported that 
his eyes looked kind of red 
the whole time, but speculat-
ed, “Well, it’s been warming 
up. Maybe his allergies are 
getting bad. That’s probably 
it, right?”
Another added, “I don’t 
know, he kind of lost his train 
of thought a few times. He 
was there, then he wasn’t. 
He came back, giggled a lit-
tle. He probably hasn’t been 
getting enough sleep. That 
has to have something to do 
with it. I mean, it’s only, like, 
12:45.”
But students were left 
unable to explain away one 
particularly uncomfortable 
moment. As he was ?elding a 
question about how to graph 
a function from the problem 
set, Stein could not say the 
word “asymptote” without 
laughing uncontrollably. The 
whole class looked on awk-
wardly as he giggled to him-
self while sketching the func-
tion on the board.
Six minutes later, Stein 
reportedly repeated “asymp-
tote” under his breath before 
snickering to himself a little 
longer.
Upon ?ling out of Wean 
5417 after class, which Stein 
dismissed seven minutes 
early, a student was over-
heard whispering to a friend, 
“Come on. He’s de?nitely 
blazed.”
Shortly after, Stein was 
seen leaving La Prima Espres-
so with one croissant, one 
salted caramel cupcake, three 
chocolate chip cookies, and a 
hot cocoa with extra whipped 
cream.
He was unable to com-
ment, only managing to 
mumble about “how deli-
cious this cupcake is” be-
tween bites.
Tazza D’Oro employee cuts short Brahms’ Brandenburg Symphony Number Three Op. 90 to play vinyl recording of nails on a chalkboard
BRENT HEARD
Prefers his chalkboard-based 
music to be in the key of G
Last Tuesday, as students, 
professors, and other clos-
eted hipsters sat down with 
their coffees at Tazza D’Oro, 
one of the baristas decided to 
change the music.
The rich sounds of Bach’s 
Brandenburg Symphony No. 
3 had carried through the 
café at 10 a.m., just as its oc-
cupants opened the lids of 
their laptops to begin their 
work — at least for a few min-
utes before checking twitter.
This typical pattern of ac-
tion was abruptly interrupted 
when Chaz, a barista of two 
years, began a slow, saun-
tering walk toward the iPod 
plugged into the café’s wall.
The eyes of regular pa-
trons ?icked up from their 
screens quickly, sensing 
movement toward the music 
source. Tension built as their 
senses, ?nely honed over 
their years of café patronage, 
warned them of an impend-
ing shift in the music.
Chaz, who has worked at 
the café since the tragic disso-
lution of his accordion-based 
Joy Division tribute band, 
reportedly thought interrupt-
ing what is widely consid-
ered to be the best piece of 
Baroque-era classical music 
with the audio of a human 
?ngernail having its external 
layers slowly peeled away by 
a ?attened piece of porcelain 
clay would “better suit the 
Tuesday morning vibe.”
While some newer, weak-
er customers packed up their 
computers and made their 
way to a different workspace, 
the regulars stayed without 
much complaint.
“It’s not that bad,” Lauren 
Mitchell, a senior design ma-
jor remarked. “I remember 
my freshman year when they 
switched the music from Ar-
cade Fire to a National Geo-
graphic Society recording of 
wildebeest mating calls right 
during lunch time! Now that 
was a change.”
Even those frightened off 
by the cacophony seemed to 
forget all about the incident 
come Wednesday, when the 
line for coffee and pastries 
once again stretched halfway 
throughout the café.

Dietrich students demand respect, more rum in the next cuba libre
JUSTIN MCGOWN
Remembers when it was 
H&SS 
Dietrich College students 
have recently issued a formal 
statement of protest with re-
gards to their perception by 
students in other schools.
“We have to let people 
know that it’s not really a case 
of us being H and Less Stress 
like they say,” junior cre-
ative writing and psychology 
double major Robert Young 
said as he lounged in a pool 
chair nursing a tequila sunrise 
made to the exacting speci-
?cations laid out by Ernest 
Hemingway.
“We may not be up until 
three in the morning working 
on 15-112 or concepts or deal 
with long hours in the lab try-
ing to get our circuit boards to 
work, but let me assure you, 
we have plenty of stressors of 
our own. 
Take this poem I wrote for 
class. It had to be ?ve lines 
without rhyme or rhythm. I 
wracked my brain on it for 
weeks and still had to ask for 
a one month extension … 
which I got.”
Young gestured languidly 
toward a typed sheet on the 
table next to his leatherbound 
notebook. 
The poem, entitled “The 
Farce of Birth” was too lewd 
for publication, and also im-
plicated several students in 
deeply personal and question-
ably legal matters.
“Just because my earliest 
class is at noon, and I haven’t 
taken a course on a Friday for 
the past six semesters doesn’t 
mean I’m not putting in the 
same effort as an engineer or 
computer science student,” 
Young insisted, “Humanities 
majors deserve respect, espe-
cially because after gradua-
tion, a degree from Carnegie 
Mellon doesn’t give you quite 
as much of an edge when 
you’re trying to get a job at a 
Starbucks near a publishing 
?rm.”
Young sighed sadly and 
downed the remains of his 
drink before ordering “a not 
so gentle kiss” of Jameson in 
an espresso.
“I’ve got class in half an 
hour, I need to fuel up.”

Tales from Abroad: Shirley Apartments
THE LONG DISTANCE WALKERS 
ASSOCIATION
Not Zeke Rosenberg
“You’ve come a long way, 
sir,” said the Shirley customs 
of?cer as I handed him my 
passport. I glanced at the 
sign, barely legible through 
the grime built up from years 
of neglect, and began the ex-
perience of a lifetime.
I never expected my visit 
to Shirley to become such an 
all-consuming experience. I 
came for the sense of wonder 
that accompanies my travels 
to places unknown; I stayed 
because Shirley taught me 
how truly special it can be 
to live outside the comforts 
and familiarity of my home  
 nation.
The bravery the people 
of Shirley show merely to 
obtain an education at Carn-
egie Mellon University never 
ceases to amaze. Despite 
the exorbitant cost and slip-
shod maintenance of campus 
housing, the community is 
still six blocks from the near-
est Andrew printer, a deadly 
trip in the winters that chill 
the faraway land.
Some might balk at the 
eternal walk from the Jared 
L. Cohon University Center 
to Shirley’s concrete porch; 
it takes effort to truly come 
to appreciate the charm of 
living as far away as a per-
son possibly can from cam-
pus while still being charged 
for the convenience of living 
close to campus. Sometimes 
I’ll still lose my temper as I 
shiver through hour three of 
my journey just to get home 
from class. However, the long 
lesson in emotional resolve 
?ve days a week, sometimes 
twice, is what allows Shirley 
to be the truly special place 
it is.
Hey, when you have the 
last possible room selection 
time, ?ve minutes of sleep 
a day is the kind of sacri?ce 
you have to make.
Opinion: My earnest change into an ardent communist
KYLE HENSON
But seriously, screw  
Obamacare
Avid readers of The Tar-
tan will have noticed that I’ve 
taken a bit of a break from my 
weekly right-leaning libertari-
an commentary on current af-
fairs, and instead have left the 
pages of forum to my mostly 
liberal colleagues. I’d like to 
use this article as an attempt 
to explain my absence.
I graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon in December, and have 
done a lot of soul searching 
since then. I realized that I’m 
nothing more than an aver-
age upper-middle-class white 
kid who bumbled his way 
through a private high school 
education and landed himself 
at a top-tier business school. 
Because of my fortunate up-
bringing, I’m clearly not en-
titled to the fruits of my labor, 
as they’re unfairly attained 
through opportunities not 
afforded others. My current 
situation simply cannot be 
explained away by any hard 
work or enterprise on my part.
This realization, combined 
with a few heart-to-hearts 
with my colleague Justin Mc-
Gown, have made me under-
stand that I don’t deserve the 
fruits of my labor. 
But, of course, because 
I’ve realized this about my-
self, I can also rightly apply 
this logic to everyone else. 
Nobody deserves the fruits 
of their labors because it is 
society’s contribution to their 
life, or maybe even good luck, 
that has landed all successful 
people where they are. It is 
this realization that explains 
my hiatus from The Tartan. 
For in these last few months, 
I’ve realized that capitalism is 
evil, and in its place, the Unit-
ed States of America should 
switch to communism.
It’s so clear to me now that 
communism is the only fair 
system through which a pa-
triot like me can adequately 
serve his country. 
Taking from each accord-
ing to their ability and giv-
ing to each according to their 
need assures that everything 
I do will be fairly and equi-
tably distributed across the 
populace, giving me far more 
incentive to work the 60-hour 
weeks that I do now than capi-
talism ever could.
Of course, this depends on 
having a government system 
free from corruption or inef-
?ciency so that I can be com-
pletely certain that everything 
that the government takes 
from me is fairly allocated 
across the country. While this 
may be what brought down 
the USSR, the United States of 
America is certainly immune 
to those ?aws. 
This is the government 
that won both world wars. 
When has our government 
ever been corrupt, inef?cient, 
deceptive, or even shown the 
slightest tendencies toward 
immorality?
Unfortunately, word count 
forces my hand and I can’t 
continue writing, but I hope 
with just this brief article, 
I can open your hearts and 
minds to the wondrous pos-
sibilities that communism has 
in store for the United States 
of America.
 If there’s just one take-
away from this article, though, 
it’s the realization that you, 
humble reader, don’t deserve 
anything you’ve worked for.

Dead things. When you think about it, everything you eat is dead.
Computer science student rushed to hospital after being ripped in half by overly enthusiastic, excessively strong, Google and  Microsoft recruiters

NIVEDITA CHOPRA
Would rather not be in a ?ght
Tragedy struck the Techni-
cal Opportunities Conference 
(TOC) last Tuesday in yet an-
other ?ght between tech com-
panies over a student. Felicia 
Hacker, a senior computer 
science major, was rushed to 
the Magee-Women’s Hospital 
after she was ripped in half 
during a ?ght between Lisa 
Page, a recruiter for Google, 
and Maria Gates, a recruiter 
for Microsoft.
According to eyewitnesses, 
a casually-dressed Hacker ap-
proached the Google booth at 
the career fair and handed her 
resume to Page. Glancing at 
Hacker’s resume, Page excit-
edly yelled, “OMG, you have 
a 4.0, and you’re a head TA 
and you interned at Microsoft 
last summer! We really want 
you!!” Hearing “4.0” and “Mi-
crosoft” in the same sentence 
was enough to distract Gates 
at Microsoft’s booth nearby, 
and she rushed over to see 
what was going on. On see-
ing Hacker, one of Microsoft’s 
most-pampered interns from 
last summer, at the Google 
booth, Gates jostled her way 
through the serpentine lines 
at Google’s booth and angrily 
approached Hacker and Page. 
Gates and Page then engaged 
in a shouting match replete 
with obscenities, followed by 
a tug-of-war involving Hack-
er during which Hacker was 
ripped apart.
Jess Wannabe, a senior 
history major with a minor 
in computer science, said of 
the incident, “I was standing 
there wishing that they were 
?ghting over me. I would 
totally not care about being 
ripped apart if Google and Mi-
crosoft both gave me an awe-
some job offer.”
Hacker was unavailable for 
comment, but sources close to 
her say that she is unlikely to 
work at either Microsoft or 
Google in the future. “She’s 
really keen on working at 
this start-up in San Francisco, 
which is building an app that 
you can use to send cat pic-
tures to your friends. She was 
at the TOC just for the swag,” 
said a friend of Hacker’s who 
did not wish to be named.
ArchE enters Guinness Book of World Records for 5 year all-nighter
KATE GROSCHNER
Abandoned her  
architecture minor
The Guinness Book of 
World Records announced 
Thursday that Carnegie Mel-
lon ?fth year architecture 
student Sarah “Red Bull” 
Jones has set the new world 
record for longest all-nighter. 
Jones was given the title after 
staying awake for her entire 
?ve-year undergraduate ca-
reer.
The director of the Guin-
ness Book of World Records, 
Lane Liszt, said that “Had we 
had known this record was 
being set we probably would 
have stopped the attempt. 
Honestly we’re not sure how 
Sarah survived. We’ve talked 
to doctors, and medically, she 
should have died years ago.”
When re?ecting on Jones’ 
career, architecture professor 
June Wideawaké said that 
“Honestly, the faculty are not 
surprised. I mean, if someone 
had only kept track of our 
PhDs, any of us would have 
beaten Sarah for the title. 
Also, this now explains all the 
built in beds and pillows in 
Sarah’s projects.”
Jones was not available 
for comment. She was last 
seen passed out on the ?oor 
of Margaret Morrison.

First year Gregory Cole, 
electrical and computer engi-
neering and computer science 
double major, is facing pos-
sible internal disciplinary ac-
tion against him as a result of 
spreading vicious and aggres-
sive lies while representing 
the university. Cole, originally 
from Madison, Wisconsin, 
has volunteered as a host for 
sleeping bag weekend numer-
ous times this past academic 
year. The investigation is fo-
cused on Cole’s allegedly er-
roneous behavior during the 
Sleeping Bag Weekend at the 
end of January.
According to an unnamed 
bystander, Cole lied unapolo-
getically to this particular 
bagger’s face. The prospec-
tive student, or “bagger,” was 
18-year-old Harvey Millstein-
Wang from Smileyberg, Kan-
sas, who hopes to double ma-
jor in computer science and 
industrial design if he decides 
to attend Carnegie Mellon. 
According to this eyewitness, 
Millstein-Wang asked Cole 
about the nature of the work-
load, asking for speci?cs such 
as “amount of sleep,” and 
“amount of time spent with 
friends.” 
Cole’s response, allegedly, 
was to turn to face his bagger, 
and respond: “I get so much 
sleep sometimes it feels like 
I’m on vacation while get-
ting a world class education.” 
The eyewitness claims that 
Millstein-Wang looked elated 
by the rhyming nature of the 
response, so Cole felt comfort-
able vamping more. “Yeah, my 
friends and I totally are able 
to hang out and party all the 
time. The work is totally man-
ageable and by the weekend 
we are totally ready to rage, 
and we usually do that on 
Beeler.” 
At this point Cole is said to 
have ?ailed a pointing ?nger in 
the direction of Beeler Street. 
Millstein-Wang seemed to 
completely believe Cole, and 
is said to have looked mildly 
horri?ed.
These such lies threaten 
the integrity of the Carnegie 
Mellon community, and thus 
Cole is expected to face some 
sort of consequence out of the 
Community Standards review. 
The Carnegie Mellon ad-
ministration and Of?ce of Ad-
missions encourage student 
hosts during sleeping bag 
weekend to be brutally hon-
est about workload, even if 
detailing their life brings them 
to tears. 
The Of?ce of Admission 
hopes to more organically por-
tray the school this way, and 
attract the proper students 
who will commit to Carnegie 
Mellon. 
The more students who 
are into sucking the fun out 
of life, the better and stronger 
the campus will become. As 
April marks a time of frequent 
sleeping bag weekends, it’s 
important that potential hosts 
go into the process knowing 
about the consequences of be-
ing an inauthentic host.

Hasn’t shopped for clothes in 
four years
Free clothing allows you 
to save up for more important 
things in life! Let’s take a clos-
er look at the different types 
of free clothing making the 
rounds at Carnegie Mellon.
The Dropbox T-shirt
This one is a staple in ev-
ery CS major’s wardrobe, 
and most Carnegie Mellon 
students possess at least one 
Dropbox T-shirt. Next time 
you’re planning for a themed 
event, think of creative themes 
around the Dropbox logo be-
cause that’s once piece of ap-
parel that you can be certain 
everyone has. If you don’t 
have one yet, be sure to go to 
the next career fair or Dropbox 
tech talk and grab one!
Random company T-shirts 
There’s no point in buying 
T-shirts while you’re at col-
lege! When someone hands 
you a free T-shirt at the TOC 
or at an event that you’re at-
tending for the free food, you 
should just take it, even if you 
don’t know (or care) what the 
company does. Maybe some-
day they’ll be famous, but until 
then, “I got it at the TOC” is a 
perfectly acceptable response 
to questions about what the 
company does.
CMU + popular company 
logo
These are limited-edition 
T-shirts, because they were 
made speci?cally to recruit 
Carnegie Mellon students. 
They’re great to ?aunt, and 
they make you feel good, be-
cause you’re showing Carne-
gie Mellon pride without hav-
ing to purchase an overpriced 
T-shirt at the bookstore. Next 
time you hear that special 
Carnegie Mellon swag is be-
ing handed out at an event, re-
member that it’s totally worth 
skipping of?ce hours for. 
 
Winter clothing
What better way to keep 
warm than in free hats, gloves 
and scarves? Especially touch-
screen-sensitive gloves that let 
you text while out in the cold. 
These cozy items are pretty 
rare as well, so keep an eye out 
for them.
Jackets
Most swag jackets signify 
that the wearer has interned 
for that company, so they have 
a certain class about them 
and are obviously hard to get. 
Don’t be fooled by the light-
gray ?imsy Microsoft jackets, 
though — they just gave those 
to everyone who interviewed 
with them.

Five innovative uses for the Gates-Hillman Helix
NIVEDITA CHOPRA
Permanent resident of Gates
Since the Helix in Gates 
is pretty ill-suited as a form 
of transportation between 
?oors, we tried to think of 
reasons why they might have 
built it. Here are ways you 
can actually use the Helix:
5) Take a nap between 
classes
Want to take a nap in the 
middle of the day but don’t 
want passers-by to judge 
you? The Helix is an excellent 
way to snatch a half-hour of 
sleep between classes after 
that all-nighter of code and 
caffeine. Use the low footfall 
in the area (perhaps the only 
such one in an overridden 
Gates) to your advantage.
4) Spy on people in 
various corners of Gates 
4 and 5
The Helix is the perfect 
place to camp out and closely 
observe CS majors in their na-
tive environment. The going-
ons may surprise you!
3) Have a loud and 
personal phone 
conversation
Need somewhere that 
you can speak as loudly as 
you want without disturbing 
anyone? The Helix is ideally 
suited to your purpose. Not 
recommended for job inter-
views, unless Tazza D’Oro 
isn’t playing music.
2) Get exercise while 
mulling over CS 
problems
15-251 taking over your 
life? You might want to work 
off those excess calories from 
all the comfort food by walk-
ing up and down the Helix, 
contemplating those pesky 
problems and the possibility 
of transferring into Dietrich 
or Tepper.
1) Ride a chair down the 
Helix for entertainment
The ultimate source of 
entertainment in your dull 
life at CMU is to grab a chair 
with wheels and ride it down 
the Helix. I’ve heard that the 
spiral of the Helix rivals the 
slope in Baker Hall. Beware 
of a certain professor who 
patrols the corridors at all 
hours!

Sated student bakes apology cake: “Sorry I Sexiled You!”
SARAH GUTEKUNST
“It’s not even my birthday but 
he wanna lick the icing off”
Con?icts with roommates 
can be life-ruining. That per-
son knows where you sleep 
and what you eat, so he or she 
is also pretty hard to avoid. 
It’s of the utmost importance 
that this relationship stays 
amicable.
But what is also of the ut-
most importance is that you 
get laid sometimes. When 
the opportunity arises, there 
may be no other choice but to 
kick your roommate out. They 
cannot stand between you 
and that sweet, sweet release.
Unfortunately, not all 
roommates will value your 
ability to get some as much 
as you do. While that’s under-
standable, it’s kind of annoy-
ing. You’ve ?nally gotten it in, 
but now you’re in trouble with 
the roomie. Just apologizing 
feels pretty empty, because 
let’s face it: You don’t mean it. 
But if you don’t do anything, 
you will upset the delicate 
balance of roommate diplo-
matic relations.
However, the solution 
is clear. What solves every-
thing? Baked goods. Except 
the store-bought kind. I per-
sonally recommend funfetti 
cake mix with vanilla canned 
frosting.
If you’re feeling extra fan-
cy, you can get a tube of gel-
based, decorating frosting to 
write, “Sorry I sexiled you” 
on the cake. Your roommate 
will appreciate the extra ef-
fort, and it’s great Instagram 
material.
Really, this is the perfect 
apology. It’s inexpensive, in-
volves minimal labor, and 
your roommate will prob-
ably be blown away with your 
work. They were probably 
just prepared to be passive ag-
gressive for about a week, and 
now they’ve got a cake!
But also, what kind of 
roommate is going to demol-
ish a 9x13 sheet cake all by 
themselves? They’ll probably 
give you a slice or two out of 
gratitude, and you’ll accept 
because cake.
Then, in that moment, 
what was once an apology 
cake will transform into a cel-
ebration cake. In your mind, 
it will read, “Congrats on the 
sex!” and it will taste that 
much sweeter.

Awkward nerd couple at fall concert clearly doesn’t understand how to grind
LULA BANKER
Group-X grinding instruc-
tor: “Move your body like a 
cyclone.”
With Carnival approach-
ing and Matt and Kim slated 
to perform, Activities Board 
and the Of?ce of Student Life 
want to clarify and inform 
campus members of the prop-
er ways to grind at a concert. 
At the campus’s fall concert, 
sophomore civil engineering 
major Stephanie Lewd and 
junior computer science and 
philosophy double major Ed-
vard Khatchafer received a 
lot of criticism for the way in 
which they chose to grind. 
Their technique — using each 
other’s posteriors, in turn, to 
scratch their partner’s mid-to-
upper backs — demonstrated 
a clear lack of grinding knowl-
edge on this campus.
Lewd and Khatchafer, who 
hooked up this fall but have 
since broken up, blame the 
end of their “relationship” 
on their ignorance of grind-
ing technique. “If I had been 
taught about the appropriate 
method of close-up dancing, I 
wouldn’t have felt so unhappy 
or confused by the situation,” 
Lewd said. “I know we are just 
one couple of many who were 
befuddled and ignorant and 
just sort of went for it.”
To avoid emotionally dam-
aging situations like this in the 
future, Carnegie Mellon plans 
to release a small handbook 
— in both digital and paper 
forms — detailing the ways 
in which a person should ap-
proach, perform, and derive 
pleasure from grinding. This 
step-by-step manual will fea-
ture detailed illustrations and 
helpful tips from current stu-
dents, alumni, and campus 
faculty, who have extensive 
experience in the area.
“Carnegie Mellon is an in-
stitution that ?rmly believes 
in educating its community 
to make it a healthier, hap-
pier, and safer place for its 
students,” Barb Grengold, 
the associate dean of student 
affairs, said. “I know I speak 
for our president and Stu-
dent Life when I say that we 
look forward to seeing some 
technically excellent and very 
sexy grinding in just a few 
short weeks.”

Board of Trustees mem-
bers have pledged to contrib-
ute $20 for each senior that 
donates $5 until Commence-
ment.
The pledge has the po-
tential to raise more than 
$27,000, according to Student 
Body President (SBP) and se-
nior electrical and computer 
engineering and business ad-
ministration double major Ian 
Glasner.
Glasner announced the 
giving initiative to the student 
body by email, saying, “Give 
today, and turn your $5 into 
$25.”
The initiative, which 
Glasner has been working 
on for the past few months, 
arose from conversations that 
he had with Chairman of the 
Board of Trustees Ray Lane in 
late February, when the two 
met at a Board event in San 
Francisco. After their initial 
talks, the Board voted to ap-
prove the idea.
“Senior giving is a bench-
mark similar to alumni giving 
in that there’s no way to really 
poll students or alumni as to 
whether they enjoyed their 
experience,” said Assistant 
Director of Annual Giving 
Nicole Atwell via email. “Giv-
ing is a proxy for that.... The 
thought is that if they ?nd the 
value in their degree and care 
about the future of the school, 
they’ll give back and invest in 
the school to help others have 
the same great experience.”
According to Atwell, Presi-
dent Subra Suresh has been 
working on raising the giving 
rate, both from alumni and 
current students since he took 
of?ce in 2013. 
When Glasner took of?ce 
as SBP, he helped to found the 
Proud to Be Plaid Committee, 
which focuses on increasing 
student giving. Nearly 700 
undergraduate students have 
given this year, and almost 
300 of those are senior gifts.
Atwell attributed these 
numbers from overall under-
graduates to such initiative’s 
as the Student Athlete Ad-
visory Board’s challenge to 
have all student-athletes give 
back this year, as well as CMU 
Crowdfunding, an initiative 
started this year to fund stu-
dent organizations and en-
deavors by the larger campus 
community through a website 
similar to Indiegogo.
Atwell also attributed the 
donations rates among se-
niors to the efforts of a new 
Proud to Be Plaid Committee. 
Glasner founded the Proud to 
Be Plaid Committee at the be-
ginning of the year to increase 
the senior giving rate. He en-
listed the help of sophomore 
math major Connie Yang and 
sophomore statistics major 
Michael McCaffrey to head 
the committee. Yang and Mc-
Caffrey led discussions on the 
best ways to increase student 
giving participation.
Peer-to-peer conversations 
and targeting Greek commu-
nities, as well as outreach-
ing with Highland Ambas-
sadors and Andrew Carnegie 
Scholars, seem to be the most

Last Lecture. 
At these lectures, se-

achieved their own success, 
what they learned along the 
way, and the wisdom they 
want to pass on about how to 
lead one’s life.
McHale spoke ?rst, open-
ing the lecture with the words, 
“I will be very honest and sin-
cere for both my successes and 
failures.”
McHale has taught two 
StuCos. He learned a lot from 
them, possibly more than his 
students learned from him, 
he said. McHale believes that 
StuCos are a great opportunity 
for ?rst-year students to learn 
from upperclassmen, as they 
are places where “students are 
accessible to students.”
McHale said that at Carn-
egie Mellon, he is “surround-
ed by geniuses.” He said that 
he was successful during his 
four years at Carnegie Mellon 
because “I failed so much in 
leadership. “

Town hall details strategic plans
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
University administra-
tors, faculty, staff, and stu-
dents met in Posner Hall 
last Wednesday for the last 
of three campus-wide town 
halls to re?ne Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Strategic Plan. The 
meetings are a precursor to 
the ?nalized Strategic Plan, 
which the university expects 
to announce at the beginning 
of next semester.
The Strategic Plan, an ini-
tiative announced at the be-
ginning of this academic year, 
is built on three main pillars: 
Transformative Teaching and 
Learning; Transformative 
Research, Creativity, Innova-
tion, and Entrepreneurship; 
and The Transformative 
CMU Experience. A different 
team of administrators and 
faculty leads each focus of 
the Strategic Plan.
During the town hall, 
leaders from each focus area 
discussed how they were 
approaching their concen-
tration and what initiatives 
they had come up with. Na-
than Urban, interim provost, 
spoke about Transformative 
Teaching and Learning.
“Our students are not 
choosing to take intellectual 
risks … We want to encour-
age intellectual exploration,” 
Urban said. He outlined sev-
eral possibilities for address-
ing this problem, including 
making more courses pass/
fail, putting a cap on the 
number of units that stu-
dents can take each semester, 
and ensuring that a course’s 
units accurately re?ect the 
amount of work involved in 
that course.
Darrin Willis, a senior 
electrical and computer en-
gineering major, said that 
the unit system was inef-
fective for him, because al-
most all of his classes are 12 
units. “When I ?rst arrived, I 
thought it was very nice that 
there was a unit system, be-
cause I thought it would al-
low for both harder classes 
and less strenuous classes,” 
Wilson said. “It would be in-
teresting to see what it would 
look like if we had more 18-
unit classes that were part of 
the standard curriculum, or 
other numbers of units.”
Next, Richard Scheines, 
dean of the Dietrich College 
of Humanities and Social Sci-
ences, proposed a method for 
engaging students in inter-
disciplinary work. Scheines 
outlined a curriculum in 
which students would begin 
learning about a topic dur-
ing their ?rst year, and carry 
their work with that topic 
through a senior capstone 
project that would focus on 
interdisciplinary research.

University Police were 
alerted of a male who was 
entering the Pittsburgh Tech-
nology Center and harassing 
a female employee. Police in-
vestigated and identi?ed the 
male. He was warned about 
his questionable conduct and 
given a de?ant trespass warn-
ing letter, prohibiting him 
from returning to Carnegie 
Mellon leased or owner prop-
erty.
Harassment, Disorderly 
Conduct
March 26, 2015
A female student contacted 
University Police after she 
was struck with an egg. The 
female stated that at around 
9 p.m. she was standing on 
Forbes Avenue when an egg 
was propelled from a mov-
ing vehicle at her. The female 
was uncertain of the vehicle’s 
description, only saying that 
it was a dark-colored sedan. 
A second person later came 
forward and stated that he 
was nearly struck by an egg 
around the same time. The 
male described the vehicle as 
a white jeep or SUV.
Cell Phone Theft
March 27, 2015
A Carnegie Mellon student 
contacted University Police 
after her cell phone was un-
lawfully taken from the base-
ment-level television lounge 
in the Jared L. Cohon Univer-
sity Center. The victim stated 
that she left her belongings 
unattended approximately 
4:50–5 p.m. This investigation 
is ongoing.

A device developed within 
the Robotics Institute won 
$20,000 as the winner of the 
2014 Louis Braille Touch of 
Genius Prize for Innovation.
The device teaches stu-
dents how to write Braille 
with a slate and stylus, ac-
cording to a university press 
release. It was developed by 
research group TechBridge-
World. Students began work-
ing on the device, called 
the Braille Writing Tutor, in 
2006. It has been tested in 
such countries as Bangla-
desh, India, and Tanzania.
The device has the poten-
tial to service areas of the 
world where Braille typewrit-
ers are not easily accessible.
The hardware speci?ca-
tions and software can be 
downloaded online for oth-
ers wishing to build similar 
devices, according to the re-
lease.
Members of TechBridge-
World also developed a ver-
sion of the device that relies 
on batteries for areas that do 
not have access to reliable 
power sources.
“The Braille Writing Tutor 
has been one of our most suc-
cessful projects to date,” said 
M. Bernardine Dias, director 
and founder of TechBridge-
World, in the release. “We’ve 
seen the profound impact 
it has on blind and visually 
impaired students and their 
teachers in communities 
where we have been fortu-
nate to test the tutor.”
Dias is also an associate 
research professor of robot-
ics.
TechBridgeWorld’s mis-
sion includes implementing 
technology to meet develop-
ment needs across the globe. 
The group aims to leverage 
relationships with others in 
developing areas to under-
stand technology’s global 
in?uence. The group lists 
two main principles on its 
website: “sharing expertise 
to create innovative and lo-
cally suitable solutions, and 
empowerment of indigenous 
populations to create sustain-
able solutions.”
Braille-teaching technology wins prize
Former post-doc visits British Parliament to present research
Euan Wielewski is a for-
mer post-doctoral research 
associate at Carnegie Mel-
lon. He worked with pro-
fessor of physics Robert 
Suter and professor of mate-
rials science and engineering 
Marc De Graef on research 
regarding X-ray and electron 
diffraction, according to his 
LinkedIn pro?le.
Now he is a faculty mem-
ber at the University of 
Glasgow and one of 210 re-
searchers who presented to 
the British Parliament for a 
poster competition hosted 
by SET for Britain. SET for 
Britain aims to promote the 
country’s “early-stage and 
early-career research scien-
tists, engineers, technolo-
gists, and mathematicians,” 
according to its website.
“This annual competi-
tion is an important date in 
the parliamentary calendar 
because it gives [members 
of Parliament] an opportu-
nity to speak to a wide range 
of the country’s best young 
researchers,” said Andrew 
Miller, chairman of the Par-
liamentary and Scienti?c 
Committee in a university 
press release.
Wielewski presented 
research from his time at 
Carnegie Mellon, as well as 
from his time at Cornell Uni-
versity. Wielewski’s research 
focused on determining the 
reliability of certain materi-
als used to make jet engine 
parts.
“Presenting our research 
at the House of Parliament 
was a real honor and a great 
experience,” said Wielewski 
in the release. “It’s rare that 
early career researchers 
get the opportunity to talk 
to politicians about their 
work.”

outstanding circumstances.
With the code, the Com-
mittee hopes to improve 
stress culture by promoting 
communication between 
professors and students to 
increase transparency be-
tween both parties. By in-
creasing communication, 
the Committee intends for 
students to be able to ask

spoke next about Transforma-
tive Research, Creativity, In-
novation, and Entrepreneur-
ship. This focus area was 
broken down further into four 
smaller categories: reputa-
tion, environment, culture, 
and infrastructure.
Jahanian spoke most about 
methods for improving Carne-
gie Mellon’s environment and 
culture by fostering a more 
inclusive dialogue on campus 
between faculty and students 
and working to “provide the 
foundation for our students, 
staff, and faculty to be leaders 
in their life [sic],” according 
to the slides that accompanied 
his presentation.
Vice President for Campus 
Affairs Michael Murphy and 
Dean of Student Affairs Gina 
Casalegno led the discussion 
on the last focus of the Strate-
gic Plan, The Transformative 
CMU Experience.
Murphy began by asking 
audience members, “What 
kind of lives do we want to 
lead?”
Casalegno outlined ways 
to create a “transformative 
Carnegie Mellon experience,” 
speaking on behalf of Vice 
Provost for Education Amy 
Burkert, who could not attend 
the town hall. Casalegno sug-
gested an “innovation term” 
— an I-term — a period of 
time during which students 
could be on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus, but without the pres-
sures of their everyday aca-
demic lives.
Erik Pintar, an electrical 
and computer engineering 
major and ?fth-year scholar, 
said that an I-term would be 
the ideal time for students 
to learn and work together 
without the burden of their 
coursework. “It’s not often 
that students are at Carnegie 
Mellon without a lot of work, 
without a lot happening,” he 
said. “And I think that time 
when we do, when we don’t 
have work hanging over our 
heads, could allow that open 
thinking and the free time to 
be together and think with 
other students, without think-
ing about grades and organi-
zations and things like that.”
Murphy emphasized the 
potential of everyone within 
the Carnegie Mellon commu-
nity. “What we inherit at this 
place is enormous, enormous 
talent…. In an extraordinary 
community with extraordi-
nary people, there’s an oppor-
tunity to go beyond.”
effective ways to encourage 
student giving, particularly 
in seniors, said Atwell.
Other peer schools have 
been doing senior gift drives 
for years. At the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology 
(MIT), 76 percent of seniors 
gave back last year.
“That sort of giving rate 
and the ability to educate stu-
dents as to why giving is im-
portant also shows in schools 
such as MIT’s undergraduate 
alumni giving rates,” Atwell 
wrote. These giving rates are 
the numbers used for rank-
ings such as those provided 
by U.S. New & World Report.
Glasner expressed hope 
that the initiative would work 
to increase CMU’s endow-
ment, which, like the giving 
rates, is “minuscule” com-
pared to peer institutions.
“Ray [Lane] was excited 
about this idea because he, 
like me, understands the im-
portance of giving back to 
Carnegie Mellon,” Glasner 
said. “When it comes down to 
it, student giving is not about 
the money. It’s about the par-
ticipation rate.”
The trustees’ gifts will add 
to the nearly $1 million that 
they already give annually 
and the larger, multi-year 
initiatives they contribute to 
individually not included in 
the $1 million, according to 
Atwell. The money donated 
by board members will be put  
into either an endowed schol-
arship or a physical gift on 
campus, while the gifts that 
seniors give will go to wher-
ever they designate them.
“I know we can do better,” 
Atwell said. “With continued 
support from the administra-
tion and from committed stu-
dent volunteers and donors, 
we’ll de?nitely get there.”
Glasner agreed, saying 
“We all have the same goals 
at heart — to leave CMU a 
better place than we found 
it. And [giving] is a great way 
to go about accomplishing 
that.”
group on campus that makes 
solar-powered boats. He said 
that, while he led a great 
team, he could not provide 
adequate directions when his 
team looked to him to lead. 
He said that to lead, a person 
has to be 100 percent pas-
sionate about the task that 
they are leading.
From his various leader-
ship experiences, McHale 
learned that it is necessary to 
focus more on the team than 
on the end result. “If you in-
vest in the people they notice 
and they react to it,” he said.
McHale also stressed the 
importance of people in-
side and outside of Carnegie 
Mellon. 
Key people who in?u-
enced McHale include assis-
tant teaching professor in the 
School of Computer Science 
David Kosbie, his dad, and his 
high school best friend.
“You are surrounded 
by really amazing people,” 
McHale said. “You learn a lot 
about yourself by learning 
from others.”
McHale said that his ?nal 
year at Carnegie Mellon has 
been hard because he is often 
anxious. He also said that a 
friend he was close to all four 
years grew apart from him, 
although he did not want that 
to happen. 
He said that he became 
cynical with his education 
at Carnegie Mellon; he just 
wanted to do something he 
was excited about.
“I think this is a conversa-
tion that we need to have,” 
McHale said about anxiety 
and depression. “Anxiety and 
depression are some obsta-
cles that I tried to overcome 
with my senior year ... Every-
one should never be in a place 
where you are just looking for 
another part of life.”
McHale’s ?nal point in his 
lecture was the investment 
in people. He emphasized 
“hanging around people who 
just keep you up.” 
He said that it is impor-
tant to enjoy hanging out 
with people and that he and 
his friends compliment each 
other often.
“We really do respect each 
other and compliment each 
other,” he said. “So the con-
versation is always exciting.”
McHale noted that lead-
ership is not just about the  
team, but everyone. It is very 
important to pay attention to 
people and learn from them, 
he ended.
Ray opened her presenta-
tion by telling the audience 
that although she is heav-
ily involved on campus and 
in other activities, she is not 
perfect.
Through her time at Carn-
egie Mellon, Ray learned to 
?nd balance. Her number one 
priority is, “Put health ?rst, 
make sure to eat properly, get 
enough sleep, and focus on 
things that really matter.”
She realized that “it is not 
the smallest things that mat-
ter; it is how you come out of 
the situation that matters.”
Last year was extremely 
dif?cult for Ray as her dad 
suffered through ruptured 
abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
He lived for ?ve-and-a-half 
months before passing away.
“I cried more in those ?ve 
months more that all I ever 
cried in my entire life,” Ray 
said. “You know, it was dif?-
cult mainly because I felt like 
I had the world on my side 
— senior year was perfect. I 
thought I wanted to work at 
NASA that summer ... But the 
world just crashed down at 
me in one day.”
Ray said the support 
system at Carnegie Mellon 
helped her get through that 
time. She described a support 
network of students, faculty, 
and staff who have shaped 
her into who she has become 
today.
To Ray, “People are the 
most valuable aspects in my 
life.” She reminded the audi-
ence to “never miss an oppor-
tunity to make connections, 
friendship.”
Ray ended her lecture 
with what she called 10 
cheesy pieces of wisdom, in-
cluding such things as being 
nice to people even though 
not everyone will be a fan 
of you, what doesn’t kill you 
makes you stronger, and al-
ways laugh or smile because 
it will brighten up a room.
“Really inspire other peo-
ple and be a role model to 
them,” she ended.
Throughout the lecture, 
she reminded everyone to 
remember that it is always 
possible to come out of 
something by having mental 
strength, as well as friends 
and family to create a support 
network.
The First Lectures series 
was hosted by the Under-
graduate Student Senate. 
The next event will be held 
on Monday, April 20 at 4:30 
p.m., and will feature seniors 
Sean Archie and Joanna 
Latini.

SES survey evaluates campus lifestyle
JESSICA TSAI
Junior Staffwriter
Three years ago, Carnegie 
Mellon students received an 
email to participate in the 
Carnegie Mellon University 
Student Experience Study 
(CMU-SES). Now, they are 
being asked to participate in 
it again.
Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno and Vice Pro-
vost for Education Amy Burk-
ert sent out an email asking 
students to ?ll out this year’s 
CMU-SES survey, closing on 
April 2. The university uses 
the results of the online study, 
sent out to the entire student 
body, to understand the im-
pact of various experiences in 
and out of the classroom.
The Of?ce of Institutional 
Research and Analysis helps 
to create the CMU-SES sur-
veys, according to Casalegno. 
The information will be used 
to understand how the demo-
graphics and experiences that 
characterize students relate 
to students’ perceived con?-
dence and abilities.
Casalegno said in the email 
that the survey is designed to 
pinpoint how these character-
izing factors affect students’ 
abilities. For example, the 
survey could help to show 
whether taking on leadership 
positions make students more 
con?dent at problem solving. 
The survey could also show 
whether certain character-
istics of students affect their 
personal well-being.
This year’s survey is very 
similar to the 2012 survey, 
which will allow university 
workers to study and compare 
the answers from students 
who take the survey both 
years.
“This longitudinal group 
is very interesting to us as it 
will give an even fuller sense 
of the ‘Carnegie Mellon effect’ 
on the outcome areas,” Casa-
legno said via email. “Those 
who complete both surveys 
will provide us an additional 
cohort for analysis, providing 
a ... group for whom we have 
results that spans their Carn-
egie Mellon experience.”
About 900 undergraduate 
students and 450 graduate 
students who are still enrolled 
at Carnegie Mellon took the 
survey in 2012. The results of 
the 2012 survey were shared 
at many in-person meetings 
with groups such as the Un-
dergraduate Student Senate 
and the Graduate Student 
Assembly. The survey results 
were also shared with campus 
members like academic ad-
visers, staff in the Division of 
Student Affairs, and academic 
deans and associate deans.
“This allowed for robust 
discussion and re?ection with 
the research team to further 
inform our re?ections on the 
results,” Casalegno said in the 
email. The information will 
not be published online and 
will not be shared with any-
one outside of the university.
“We are very careful with 
results such as these to ensure 
that they are not misinterpret-
ed or generalized inappropri-
ately,” Casalegno said in the 
email about reasons for not 
openly distributing the infor-
mation. “When talking about 
people’s experiences and abil-
ities, it is important to limit 
presumptions that one might 
draw from a cursory look at 
the material. I anticipate that 
we will use a similar strategy 
with this survey as well.”
Campus members can ex-
pect to know the results of the 
study early in the fall semes-
ter, according to Casalegno.
While the university does 
not distribute the study’s re-
sults for other national stud-
ies, the university uses the 
survey’s ?ndings to prepare 
other reports and documents 
like accreditation reviews and 
board reports. Casalegno said 
that the 2012 survey has al-
lowed the university to shift 
funding in order to support 
new programs, make chang-
es to existing programs, and 
change staff and faculty de-
velopment programs.
Students who complete 
the survey receive a free treat 
at Entropy+, as well as 100 
points to spend at a Survey 
Thank You Shop on items like 
free food at local restaurants, 
movie passes at local theaters, 
and university gear.
“The university uses the results of the online 
study, sent out to the entire student body, to 
understand the impact of various experiences 
in and out of the classroom.”

Facebook, New York Times won’t be perfect marriage
This week The New York Times 
announced that Facebook is in talks 
with news sites about hosting con-
tent within Facebook instead of link-
ing articles to external sites.
The plan is meant to create a 
more user-friendly experience for 
Facebook users, especially on mo-
bile devices, where clicking away to 
another site can be clumsy and slow. 
Expected partners include The New 
York Times, National Geographic, and 
Buzzfeed.
This move generates some murky 
legal waters for Facebook, which 
would host and display the content. 
Ownership and publishing rights 
are still in negotiation. Facebook has 
never before had revenue-sharing 
agreements with publishers, but 
now is discussing ways for publish-
ers to make money from advertising 
revenue.
While this agreement could lead 
to a “seamless” media consumption 
experience, as Facebook proposes, 
it also carries serious implications 
for digital journalism. When pro?ts 
are driven by advertising revenue, 
media outlets are tempted to pro-
duce “clickbait” stories eye-catching 
enough for casual consumers scroll-
ing through Facebook. This has two 
consequences: sensationalist jour-
nalism and non-substantive journal-
ism. Both can be dangerous if they 
distort reporting.
If news outlets forfeit ownership 
of their content, they also forfeit 
some degree of control over display 
and presentation. Even if they re-
tain ownership, the data that comes 
from site traf?c would no longer go 
to news outlets. They would lose in-
formation about their reader base, 
while Facebook would gain even 
more data about users’ news con-
sumption habits.
Such a partnership is also likely to 
be limited to large-scale media out-
lets with the resources to reach Face-
book. Smaller publications or niche 
stories could be lost.
As a news source, The Tartan is 
watching the evolution of online 
journalism very closely. Our own 
negotiations with USA Today over a 
joint mobile app raises similar ques-
tions about content, ownership, and 
access for readers.
Senior giving initiative shows refreshing collaboration
This week, the Proud to Be Plaid 
Committee and Ian Glasner, student 
body president, announced a collab-
orative effort to boost senior giving 
through a donation matching pro-
gram with the Board of Trustees. For 
every $5 that a senior gives between 
now and graduation, the trustees 
will donate $20.
This is an exciting development 
in the series of gift-giving initiatives 
that Carnegie Mellon has seen this 
year. Though many, including The 
Tartan in a previous editorial, felt 
that efforts were half-hearted, this 
new agreement is both welcome and 
encouraging. It is refreshing to hear 
that the Board of Trustees is stand-
ing with the students in regard to 
boosting the giving rates. According 
to the Of?ce of Giving, the trustees 
already donated well over $1 million 
together annually, and some donate 
even more in individual major gifts 
that stretch over years. While adding 
$20 might not seem signi?cant, but 
it makes every senior’s donation $25 
instead of $5. Instead of totaling just 
over $5,100, the gift would multiply 
to $27,000, creating a larger impact 
and a larger ripple effect.
The more money that is given 
toward this undecided scholarship 
or gift (yet to be decided by senior 
class voters), the more that money 
can accomplish. Considering dona-
tions as an investment in the future 
of our school is exactly the right way 
to approach this new initiative, and 
hopefully, it will encourage more se-
niors, as well as all undergraduates, 
to give.
The Board of Trustees should be 
applauded for their gesture of sup-
port, and the seniors who have given 
or will give as a part of this initiative 
should be excited to take part in a 
historic gift-giving program.
It is unclear at this time if the ini-
tiative will extend to next year or not, 
but The Tartan would like to urge the 
trustees and student government 
to continue these efforts. This gift 
means more than just $20. It means a 
tangible show of togetherness in the 
Carnegie Mellon community and an 
encouraging investment in the stu-
dents. Continued plans such as these 
show that there is real collaboration 
happening, and not just talks ?lled 
with ?owery, empty promises. Hope-
fully, it will sustain through the next 
rotation of student government.
Student Senate allotted CUC shell space democratically
After reading last week’s editorial 
opinion in the Tartan regarding shell 
space, a few inaccuracies in the piece 
have motivated me to write a letter. I 
should disclose that I am a senator in 
the Undergraduate Student Senate, 
so I’m well-informed on the issue, but 
also biased in regards to its represen-
tation to the student body.
I would ?rst like to address the 
misconception that this space was 
purchasable by any undergraduate 
student organization. It is, frankly, 
too expensive for anyone to buy but 
Senate — noting this, we made this 
decision on behalf of all undergradu-
ate representation in the student gov-
ernment. If Senate did not purchase 
this space, there is no guarantee that 
it would go to any undergraduate or-
ganization, and certainly, no other 
organization could afford it. It would 
likely go up for auction to other com-
mercial interests on campus.
Even if, hypothetically, an organi-
zation could afford the shell, there’s 
no guarantee the space would be ac-
cessible to all the undergraduates on 
campus. Democratization of space 
access is an important issue, and Sen-
ate’s purchase is the best guarantee 
of a space for all undergraduates, re-
gardless of departmental af?liation 
or organizational membership.
Another note is that we don’t re-
ceive JFC funding. From the overall 
Student Activities Fee, we get a small 
slice ($140,000) of a budget, of which 
over half goes directly to students and 
student organizations. We’ve had the 
money sitting in reserves to make a 
big expenditure like this for a while. 
Without our purchase of the shell 
space, we couldn’t have allocated in 
a better way to help the student body. 
However, if you think there are better 
options to spend that money on, tell 
us. We are always looking for oppor-
tunities to subsidize students who are 
excited to do new things.
In regards to democracy of deci-
sion-making, Senate has continuous-
ly endeavored to make the shell space 
as democratically informed as pos-
sible. We’ve spent tens of hours ta-
bling for student opinions, soliciting 
them by offering food to anyone who 
would respond. Our polling began 
during Senate Week 2014 (the sec-
ond week of October). With its high 
traf?c, the Cohen University Center 
(CUC) was the natural choice for lo-
cation. We incentivized students to 
respond by handing out free gifts.
Our big question: what is the space 
that’s needed most on this campus? 
The responses made it abundantly 
clear that students both wanted and 
needed a collaborative space for 
studying or socializing. This was the 
most feasible option that we solicited 
directly from students, so we decided 
to move forward with it.
Theoretically, at this point we 
could have directly formed our shell 
space committee. However, rather 
than restrict our vision, we reopened 
the forum for students, asking for 
students’ ideal feel of a collaborative 
space, and what resources it would 
have. We tabled again (this time’s in-
centive was cakes from Prantl’s) and 
collected responses that gave us a ro-
bust vision guided by what students 
wanted and needed with our portion 
of the shell space.
After feeling suf?ciently informed 
by the student body, we decided to 
move forward with our newly formed 
shell space committee. It’s been op-
erational since early January, which 
shows that we spent nearly a semes-
ter collecting information from the 
undergraduates who we represent.
I ?nd it hard to argue that this 
process was not democratic. There 
comes a point where one can no 
longer defer directly to students, for 
the sake of productivity. An organi-
zation’s members inform the vision 
for any organization on campus, but 
smaller working groups execute vari-
ous facets of that vision. In our orga-
nization, our membership happens to 
be a bit bigger. It is unfeasible to have 
a working team of 5,500. Simply put, 
there would be many, many referen-
dums.
We do our best to remain trans-
parent and accessible. If you have any 
opinions on the shell space, please 
direct them to us. Student Govern-
ment doesn’t exist to self-serve; we 
unabashedly seek the opinions of 
those we represent. I hope that I’ve 
provided ample response and clarity 
to the issue.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Suresh should be vocal on good and bad news
JUSTIN MCGOWN
When the Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
chapter at the University of Okla-
homa was revealed as a collection 
of racists who used drunkenness as 
an excuse for their actions, one of 
the few bright spots I could see in 
the story was the statement made by 
the University President and former 
United States senator David L. Boren 
in response to the leaked videos. 
“These people have acted in a 
way that is absolutely reprehensible 
and disgraceful. I don’t have words 
in my vocabulary to adequately de-
scribe how I feel about people who 
would use those words in that way, 
and chant in that way,” said Boren, 
according to The New York Times.
I’m glad that there hasn’t been a 
scandal of similar magnitude dur-
ing Subra Suresh’s term as Carnegie 
Mellon’s president, but it does both-
er me that I have no idea what sort 
of reaction I could expect.
Right before Spring Break, Carn-
egie Mellon had a bad week in the 
press. Hundreds of rejected students 
received acceptance emails due to 
a software error, an embarrassing 
development for a university known 
largely for its computer science pro-
gram. 
A few days after that story broke, 
a mentor in ?rst-year housing turned 
himself into the Pittsburgh Police 
Department for invading the pri-
vacy of multiple students. Though 
the incident had occurred months 
before, the university only informed 
the general population after news 
media broke the story.
It is not technically the university 
president’s role to talk to the student 
body about bad news. The Dean of 
Student Affairs is generally given 
that task, working to portray the 
university and its administration in 
the best light possible. But it seems 
to me that President Suresh should 
be clearly involved with the campus 
community, and that as its leader he 
should be an active and frequently 
heard voice in that community. 
Since he has taken of?ce, Presi-
dent Suresh’s communications to 
the students have largely consisted 
of announcing new donations to the 
Simon Initiative and ProSEED or 
providing updates on the construc-
tion of the new Tepper Quadrangle. 
Also frequent are important an-
nouncements regarding the depar-
ture and appointment of important 
administrative positions. Remind-
ers about speeches and information 
about important developments such 
as this are of course part of his job.
One of the few exceptions to 
President Suresh’s typical communi-
cations is an email sent out in August 
after the death of Michael Brown at 
the hands of the Ferguson Police 
Department and the subsequent 
nationwide protests. In the email, 
Suresh reminds us that we need to 
have an open dialogue and respect-
ful atmosphere in order to deal with 
the issues of race and prejudice, 
even if he doesn’t go into any spe-
ci?cs. It’s a political email designed 
not to offend anybody and it’s un-
derstandable, but it also closes with 
a reminder about the recent expan-
sion of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 
In this email’s urging attendance of 
day’s events, more is said about a 
speaker for a Simon Initiative event 
than any of the other activities for 
the day. There’s nothing technically 
wrong with the communications 
sent out by President Suresh’s of?ce. 
It’s understandable that President 
Suresh doesn’t want to use his posi-
tion for politics and wants to avoid 
controversy. 
But the community would ben-
e?t from hearing from our leader 
when it has nothing to do with the 
nebulously de?ned Simon Initia-
tive, or when the news is bad. I urge 
Subra Suresh to communicate more 
frequently with his students, to be a 
presence with simply stated stances 
on issues that impact us, who is not 
afraid to express opinions and help 
us understand his vision for our 
school.

A PERSON’S OPINION
The Tartan is embracing its inner jokester this week. So we asked,
What was the best April Fools’ prank you ever witnessed?
Compiled by Justin McGown
BRADEN KELNER
This year, the candidates running 
for Student Body President (SBP) 
and Student Body Vice President 
(SBVP) have each provided at least 
one promising goal 
to the student 
body.
JR Marshall and Jibby Ayo-Ani 
have proposed to increase the num-
ber of students trained to be part 
of the Survivor Support Network 
(SSN), while Divya Kothandapani 
and Mark Whiting have promised to 
bridge the gap between graduates 
and undergraduates, something that 
is sorely needed. Evan Wineland and 
Connie Yang have proposed to raise 
student wages and expand students’ 
contact with the city of Pittsburgh.
All of the above portions of 
these students’ plat-
forms seem like 
worthwhile pursuits 
for the next SBP and 
SBVP to tackle. How-
ever, many of the 
other proposed ini-
tiatives in their agen-
das seem unnecessary 
or unfeasible. I do not 
foresee high levels of 
involvement for Mar-
shall’s proposal for a reori-
entation day or Wineland’s 
proposal for a student-faculty 
lunch program. Kothandapani’s 
proposal for improved apps, while 
nice, does not seem as important as 
some of the already listed initiatives 
proposed by other candidates. These 
initiatives will either fail or not pro-
vide substantial change to our cam-
pus. I am not putting down these ini-
tiatives to lambaste the candidates’ 
platforms.
Instead, I am reviewing both the 
promising and the less promising 
positions to shed light on the fact 
that each running pair has at least 
one major initiative in their platform 
worth pursuing, as well as some that 
are not worth pursuing. If the win-
ning candidate were able to tackle 
the most important initiatives from 
each platform, they would have an 
undeniably strong presidency.
I’m writing to urge the winners of 
this year’s Student Senate debates to 
consider inviting the other serious 
candidates (sorry, Saif Jedidi and 
Ben Debebe) to their cabinet, and for 
the pairs who do not win the elec-
tions to accept those invites. While, 
of course, not all candidates can win 
the positions of SBP and SBVP, their 
proposed initiatives should not die 
with their campaign. Instead, the 
winning pair must consider working 
with their former competitors during 
the following academic year, in order 
to provide tangible change before the 
next election season.
With such highly motivated pairs 
of candidates (this year has seen 
more effort put into platforms and 
campaigning than previous years), it 
seems a shame that many of the im-
portant initiatives proposed will fall 
to the wayside, only to be replaced by 
less important initiatives like DineX 
expansion, student-faculty lunches, 
and improved apps.
In an ideal world, I would like to 
see the next SBP and SBVP tackling 
three equally ambitious goals—like 
increasing SSN participation, bridg-
ing gaps in our student body, and 
increasing student wages—rather 
than having one or two important 
proposals get dragged down by less 
important initiatives, which are often 
proposed almost every year (when 
is the last time we weren’t promised 
better faculty-student relations and 
expanded shuttle services?).
Pulling the most important ini-
tiatives from each platform would 
ensure that there are no ?uff goals 
for the next SBP and SBVP to tackle. 
But in order to make three ambi-
tious goals achievable, the winning 
pair must consider working with 
the people who ?rst proposed them, 
since these are the people who have 
thought most about these initiatives 
and probably have the best connec-
tions to make them happen.
If I were to have my way, the next 
SBP and SBVP would choose the 
most important initiative from each 
running pair’s platform, and tackle 
those three goals, rather than tack-
ling one good initiative paired with a 
few lesser initiatives. If I had my way, 
all candidates would be in the win-
ner’s cabinet to make these goals pos-
sible. With all candidates working to-
gether, I can imagine a SBP and SBVP 
pair that could enact true change on 
campus in multiple substantial areas.

Junior Staffwriter
Last Monday, Senator Ted Cruz 
kicked off the 2016 presidential elec-
tion season by announcing his can-
didacy for president. Throughout 
his speech, titled “The Promise of 
America,” Cruz invited his audience 
to imagine an America governed by 
his policies. So I invite you to do the 
same. Imagine, if you will, the prom-
ise of Ted Cruz’s America.
Policy one: “Imagine innovation 
thriving on the Internet as govern-
ment regulators and tax collectors 
are kept at bay and more and more 
opportunity is created.”
Here, Cruz is referring to net neu-
trality. You may remember his infa-
mous “Net neutrality is Obamacare 
for the Internet” tweet. The truth is, 
net neutrality keeps the Internet ex-
actly as it is now: free and open. All 
it does is prevent Internet service 
providers from biasing the way they 
provide service. Providers can’t, for 
instance, speed up or slow down 
websites based on extra fees or con-
tract negotiations. You don’t have to 
imagine innovation thriving on the 
Internet, because that’s what is hap-
pening right now. And net neutrality 
keeps it that way.
Policy two: “Imagine America ?-
nally becoming energy self-suf?cient 
as millions and millions of high-pay-
ing jobs are created.”
Cruz must be talking about a fu-
ture fueled by sustainable energy 
sources, right? Surely not oil. Surely 
not natural gas. Surely not coal. 
Right? How about solar? Wind? Geo-
thermal? Hydro-electric? Those are 
new technologies that really could 
create millions of jobs, and help bring 
the United States closer to energy 
independence. Nice work, Ted, I’m 
with you on this one 100 percent! I 
just don’t think you’re with you.
Policy three: “Imagine in 2017 a 
new president signing legislation re-
pealing every word of Obamacare.”
And replacing it with single payer 
healthcare! Obamacare has its weak 
points. It’s just that those weak points 
are the more conservative aspects of 
the bill; for instance, it includes no 
public option. But even with those 
weaknesses, Obamacare has been an 
unquestionable success. It has pro-
vided insurance coverage to millions 
of previously uninsured people. It has 
slowed the rise of healthcare and in-
surance costs. It has opened coverage 
to those with preexisting conditions, 
it has outlawed gender discrimina-
tion in providing insurance, and it 
has allowed me to stay on my parents’ 
health insurance until I’m 26.
But more importantly, Ted Cruz 
had no viable alternative. He can’t 
seek out a conservative, market-
based solution, because Obamacare 
is the conservative, market-based 
solution.
Policy four: ”Imagine a simple ?at 
tax… imagine abolishing the IRS.”
I knew Cruz was crazy, but not 
this crazy. First of all, a simple ?at 
tax would be a monumentally unfair 
tax system. Income inequality is at 
record highs as it is, and what Cruz 
is suggesting is a massive tax break 
for the wealthy, and (most likely) a 
huge tax increase for the working and 
middle class.
Beyond that, who is supposed to 
collect Cruz’s harmful, woefully in-
adequate ?at tax without the IRS? 
Is Cruz saying that he’ll collect every 
American’s taxes personally? The IRS 
doesn’t exist because taxes are high or 
complicated. The IRS exists because 
government bureaucracy may not 
be great, but it’s better than nothing 
when it comes to things like making 
sure the government has money, and 
making sure the President doesn’t 
throw away tax revenue because it 
got mixed in with his junk mail.
Policy ?ve: “Imagine a president 
that ?nally, ?nally, ?nally secures the 
borders.”
Cruz knows that President Obama 
has done more to secure the border 
than most Presidents. Cruz is re-
ally talking about Obama’s “execu-
tive amnesty,” as he likes to call it 
(it’s not), which has nothing to do 
with border security. It’s all about 
recognizing that the Department of 
Homeland Security has bigger priori-
ties than deporting a mother of three 
young American citizens or a produc-
tive, law-abiding member of society 
who was brought to the country ille-
gally as a young child.
This article is getting long. I under-
estimated the depths of Cruz’s crazy. 
It’s time for the lightning round.
Policy six: “Imagine a federal gov-
ernment that works to defend the 
sanctity of human life…”
I’ll be expecting your repeal of the 
death penalty on day one, President 
Cruz. Not to mention war. And I’m 
glad to hear you’ll be giving everyone 
free healthcare.
Policy seven: “… and to uphold 
the sacrament of marriage.”
Better get divorced now, before 
President Cruz outlaws it. It’s in the 
Bible, folks. That’s what he’s talking 
about, right?
Policy eight: “Imagine a federal 
government that protects the right to 
keep and bear arms of all law-abiding 
Americans.”
Cruz bragged on CNN this week 
about ?ghting tooth and nail to kill 
every commonsense gun control 
measure proposed after the Sandy 
Hook massacre, even the bipartisan 
ones with near universal public sup-
port. See policy six.
Policy nine: “Instead of a govern-
ment that seizes your e-mails and 
your cell phones, imagine a federal 
government that protected the pri-
vacy rights of every American.”
Even a broken clock is right twice 
a day.
Policy ten: “Imagine repealing ev-
ery word of Common Core.”
You’ll have to make it a federal law 
?rst, though, so you can repeal it.
Policy 11: “Imagine embracing 
school choice as the civil rights issue 
of the next generation…”
Because racism is dead, after all, 
along with sexism, homophobia, and 
discrimination. It’s time to let schools 
?nally have abortions, or whatever 
school choice means. But seriously, 
making it easier and more appealing 
for people to abandon public schools 
denies every child’s right to a qual-
ity, free education. School choice is 
nothing but white ?ight from public 
schools.
Policy 12: “Imagine a president 
who stands unapologetically with the 
nation of Israel.”
Because Israel is the 51st state, 
after all. (Yes, I did just dare boil US-
Israeli relations down to eight words. 
What can I say? It’s the lightning 
round!)
Policy 13: “Imagine a president 
who says ‘I will honor the Constitu-
tion, and under no circumstances 
will Iran be allowed to acquire a nu-
clear weapon.’ ”
U.S. Constitution Article V Sec-
tion 2: “Under no circumstances will 
Iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear 
weapon.” Look it up, people.
Policy 14: “Imagine a president 
who says ‘We will stand up and de-
feat radical Islamic terrorism… and 
call it by its name.’ ”
While we’re at it, let’s call the Ku 
Klux Klan or Neo-Nazis radical Chris-
tian terrorists. That’ll go over well. 
Or, as it may turn out, gross over-gen-
eralizations about people are only 
okay when they’re about the trendy 
religious or ethnic group to hate.
In conclusion, imagine Ted Cruz’s 
America: Where Net?ix is as depend-
able as Comcast. Where it’s easier to 
get a gun than to vote. Where schools 
have more choice than women. 
Where Israel gets our unwavering 
support, but millions of uninsured 
Americans are left to fend for them-
selves. Where everyone has an equal 
tax rate, regardless of their ability to 
pay, but millions of Americans don’t 
have the right to marry the person 
they love. Where oil ?ows freely 
through our pipelines, but our com-
mander-in-chief wont even acknowl-
edge that climate change exists.
We deserve better from our can-
didates. We deserve candidates who 
will talk about the real issues, like in-
come inequality and climate change 
and the money in politics. 
Who will bring real solutions to 
the table rather than pander to hate 
and emotion. Who will align their 
policies to the facts, rather than re-
ligious dogma. The good news: Ted 
Cruz will never be president. The bad 
news: He’s running, and it isn’t going 
to be pretty.

As we progress into the 
21st century, the role of arti?-
cial intelligence and robotics 
has become an increasingly 
controversial topic. While the 
increasing presence of these 
technologies has brought 
conveniences into our lives 
— from intelligent personal 
assistants to robot-assisted 
surgery — it also raises many 
concerns, including the po-
tential consequences of these 
technologies on the social 
and ?nancial welfare of future 
generations. In his latest book, 
Parenting for Technology Fu-
tures Part 1: Education & Tech-
nology, Illah Nourbakhsh, a 
professor of robotics at Carn-
egie Mellon University, offers 
parenting advice on how to 
best prepare children for a 
technology-driven future.
“I’ve written an earlier 
book which talks about the 
native impact robotic tech-
nology can have on society,” 
Nourbakhsh said. “And one of 
the most frequent questions I 
got from readers was ‘I have 
kids — what are they going to 
do in a world with a lot of un-
employment, in which robot 
technology has taken over a 
lot of what humans do today? 
How do I prepare my kids for 
that, so that they can have a 
good life, even though [the 
future] sounds like a very dif-
?cult time?’”
For a long time, Nour-
bakhsh has been pondering 
these questions. A father of 
two, Nourbakhsh joined the 
Carnegie Mellon community 
as an assistant professor of Ro-
botics in 1997. Since then, he 
has founded and directed the 
Community Robotics, Educa-
tion, and Technology Empow-
erments (CREATE) Lab. He 
also serves as the head of the 
Robotics Masters Programs 
within The Robotics Institute.
Written from the perspec-
tive of a parent and an aca-
demic expert, Nourbakhsh’s 
Parenting for Technology Fu-
tures is a response to the con-
cerns of parents for their chil-
dren’s futures, with a focus on 
current education issues. Prior 
to writing his book, he spent 
about a year reading previ-
ously published books and 
articles that existed on this 
topic. “I was trying to ?nd out 
what some of the most impor-
tant lessons to give somebody 
are,” Nourbakhsh explained. 
“I wanted to make the whole 
book really thin so that it is 
easy for anybody to read in al-
most a sitting or two.”
In addition to his readings, 
the professor also turned to 
two colleagues for assistance. 
One of the colleagues was 
Junlei Li, an associate profes-
sor of psychological science, 
co-director of the Fred Rogers 
Center, and an early child-
hood and learning expert at 
St. Vincent College. “Junlei Li 
really studies the question of 
teaching practices, and what 
it means to be innovative as 
a teacher,” Nourbakhsh said. 
The other colleague was Pro-
fessor Fatemeh Zarghami, a 
childhood and human devel-
opment instructor at De Anza 
College. She also certi?es 
child centers for the State of 
California. “I [had] the two 
of them read the early draft,” 
Nourbakhsh said. “Then I read 
their detailed comments and 
rewrote the whole thing.”
To keep the book afford-
able and accessible to par-
ents, Professor Nourbakhsh 
self-published his book on 
Amazon.com. The book is 
available in both digital and 
paperback versions.
The ?rst volume of  “Par-
enting for Technology Fu-
tures” is laid out into ?ve 
chapters that contain tutori-
als, as well as references to 
additional reading materials. 
In the introduction, the pro-
fessor states the importance 
of preparing children for mas-
tery of technology ?uency, so 
that they become “creative 
producers rather than robotic 
consumers of technology” in 
the future. Possessing tech-
nology ?uency is, however, 
described as being different 
from having technology liter-
acy, which the author believes 
sentences people to passivity 
as they set their sights “on the 
goal of correctly employing 
electronic products and digi-
tal media without hesitation.”
Following the introduction 
on technology education, the 
Researchers study the brain and technical material
DANIELLE HU

As part of the global ef-
fort to explore and under-
stand complex behaviors of 
the brain, Robert Mason, se-
nior research associate and 
Marcel Just, director of the 
Center for Cognitive Brain 
Imaging (CCBI) at Carnegie 
Mellon, have been studying 
how the brain learns and 
processes successive infor-
mation. 
In May 2015, their most 
recent ?ndings, from proj-
ects that are part of Carn-
egie Mellon’s BrainHubSM 
initiative, will be published 
in Volume 111 of the scien-
ti?c journal NeuroImage.
 Mason, the lead author 
of the study, believes that 
their work will bene?t re-
search on future learning 
techniques by approach-
ing this subject area not in 
a behavioral manner, like 
most studies in the past, but 
rather by directly examining 
the brain.
Although this topic of 
how the brain learns is an 
ongoing process that Ma-
son and Just continue to 
explore, their most recent 
paper centers around a 
study consisting of fourteen 
college students. The stu-
dents, six female and eight 
male, were asked to listen to 
informative descriptions of 
four different types of me-
chanical systems and were 
analyzed through the CCBI’s 
fMRI machine. Each partici-
pant received information 
about these systems that 
could easily be understood 
from a nontechnical stand-
point, and were given small 
visual aids to support the ex-
planations.
The researchers studied 
mechanical systems includ-
ing a bathroom scale, a ?re 
extinguisher, an automo-
bile braking system, and a 
trumpet. Although these 
objects are common to ev-
eryday life, the mechanics 
of the objects are not gener-
ally known to the public. For 
example, the participants 
in the study learned about 
the bathroom scale through 
phrases such as “A bathroom 
scale consists of a lever, a 
spring, a ratchet and a dial,” 
“the person’s weight exerts a 
downward force on a lever,”

Google teams up with Johnson & Johnson
This past Friday, Google 
and the pharmaceutical com-
pany Johnson & Johnson an-
nounced a partnership be-
tween Google’s life sciences 
division and Ethicon, a divi-
sion of Johnson & Johnson 
that makes surgical products, 
to develop new robot-assisted 
surgery technologies. 
Some of the partnership 
goals include developing soft-
ware that could highlight fea-
tures of the body that are cru-
cial but dif?cult to see, such as 
blood vessels, nerves, or the 
margins around a tumor, and 
also imaging technologies to 
give surgeons better visuals, 
all of which can be crucial to 
successfully removing cancer 
tumors. 
By pursuing this technol-
ogy, it is evident that Google 
has ambitions far beyond In-
ternet searching, especially 
with the creation of its life sci-
ences division, which is part of 
the Google X research unit.

New headway on Alzheimer’s, heart disease
According to a report from 
the scienti?c community in 
Iceland this past week, in the 
process of exploring the na-
tion’s genetic makeup, Icelan-
dic scientists have uncovered 
an unknown gene pool with 
mutations that may play roles 
in causing ailments such as 
Alzheimer’s disease, gallstone, 
and even heart diseases.
While some diseases, like 
cystic ?brosis, are caused by 
a single genetic mutation, the 
most common ones are caused 
by multiple mutations, and 
mutations to a number of dif-
ferent genes can each raise the 
risk of getting heart disease 
or even breast cancer, for ex-
ample. 
Many of these diseases, 
however, are rare, which 
means it is necessary to sample 
large groups of people in order 
to conduct research. This de-
velopment is unprecedented 
in that it involves investigating 
a smaller group of people.

Possibility of alien life on Jupiter’s moon Europa
Europa, one of Jupiter’s 
moons, is one of the few plac-
es where life could potentially 
exist due to its icy ocean, re-
searchers say. 
Researchers believe Euro-
pa to have an ocean up to 100 
kilometers deep, which is 10 
times deeper than any ocean 
on Earth. They also  have con-
cluded that the moon could 
contain twice as much water 
as Earth, which would  meet 
one of the primary conditions 
for the existence of life as we 
know it.
Researchers also believe 
that they could deduce wheth-
er life on Europa is sustainable 
without actually visiting the 
moon itself, by investigating in 
Antarctica, which is the host to 
a number of hidden lakes. Ant-
arctic lakes are the best analog 
we have for Europa’s hidden 
ocean, so, if life can endure 
the conditions under the Ant-
arctic ice, the odds of ?nding it 
on Europa will improve.

Researches suggest an alternative approach to drugs
The discovery that switch-
ing various genes on or off 
may be able to provide a new 
treatment strategy other than 
drugs, for various cancers, 
including breast cancers and 
ovarian cancers. Drugs often 
fail to reach the targeted area, 
proving to be useless, and in 
many cases even harmful as 
they affect healthy cells in-
stead of cancerous ones. After 
trying to approach this prob-
lem with drugs, scientists in 
Australia have been ?ddling 
with the cancerous tissue it-
self. “Maybe we can shift the 
tumor in the direction of the 
therapy rather than develop-
ing the therapy in the direc-
tion of the tumor,” says Rob 
Ramsay from the Peter Mac-
Callum Cancer Centre in Mel-
bourne, Australia. Along with 
new treatment development, 
this discovery could help give 
patients more information 
about their chances of sur-
vival.

Facebook tests laser drones in U.K. skies
Last Friday, Facebook CEO 
Mark Zuckerberg announced 
to the world that various teams 
at Facebook have been testing 
large, solar-powered drones in 
the skies over the U.K.
“As part of our internet.org 
effort to connect the world, 
we’ve designed unmanned air-
crafts that can beam Internet 
access down to people from 
the sky,” said Zuckerberg in a 
blog post. “We’ve successfully 
completed our ?rst test ?ight of 
these aircraft in the U.K.”
Ascenta, a Somerset, U.K.-
based designer of solar-pow-
ered drones, developed the 
drones, which are designed to 
?y for months at a time at alti-
tudes of 60,000 feet.
The purpose of Facebook’s 
internet.org initiative is to con-
nect at least another billion 
people to the Internet. The goal 
is to create new markets for the 
social network in order to add 
to the 1.39 billion monthly ac-
tive users already on Facebook.

Fatty acids suggest the possibility of life on Mars 
A molecule that could be 
a fatty acid, the equivalent of 
lard, has been found by NASA’s 
Curiosity Rover in the soil of 
the Red Planet. It is still unclear 
if the molecule originates from 
a biological source.
David Glavin, who works 
on the rover’s Sample Analysis 
at Mars instrument, presented 
the ?ndings at the Lunar and 
Planetary Science Conference 
in The Woodlands, Texas, last 
week. 
Researchers at NASA dis-
covered that there are similari-
ties between the gases released 
by samples of the fatty acid and 
various complex compounds 
on Earth. 
This might not be a direct 
sign of life, but it it does mean 
that Mars could be host to com-
plex organic molecules, which 
suggests that microbes could 
be found there in the future.

HOW THINGS WORK
Caffeine effects are often misconceived
BROOKE KUEI
Contributing Editor
Do the baristas at your lo-
cal Starbucks know you by 
name?
Even if they don’t start 
scribbling down your name 
before you open your mouth, 
you are likely part of a gener-
ation in which coffee is king. 
Most of us live and breathe 
coffee, idolizing it as a magi-
cal blend that helps us start 
our days, study for exams, 
and get through meetings. 
But what really happens af-
ter you take that ?rst sip and 
the caffeine starts to course 
through your body?
Caffeine is a central ner-
vous system stimulant, ac-
cording to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). After 
drinking or eating something 
with caffeine in it, you will 
likely experience symptoms 
such as alertness, improved 
concentration, a quickened 
heartbeat, or the jitters. But 
don’t give your coffee all the 
credit for your productivity 
just yet — you might be sur-
prised by what caffeine actu-
ally does to your body.
The truth is, caffeine is the 
ultimate chemical prankster. 
According to Medical News 
Today, adenosine is a chemi-
cal in our cells that promotes 
sleep and suppresses arousal. 
Normally, adenosine binds 
to adenosine receptors in the 
brain, causing cell activity to 
slow down. However, to an 
unsuspecting nerve cell, caf-
feine looks just like adenos-
ine. As a result, the adenosine 
receptors bind to caffeine in-
stead, leaving few left for the 
actual adenosine and causing 
cell activity to speed up in-
stead of slow down.
When the pituitary gland 
notices this increase in cell 
activity, it assumes that there 
is an emergency and tells 
the adrenal glands to secrete 
adrenaline, the ?ght-or-
?ight hormone responsible 
for your extra energy and 
fast heartbeat. The release

JOSEPH ROLLINSON
Special to The Tartan
Pugwash began this week’s 
meeting by watching Rich-
ard Stallman’s TED talk from 
2014. Stallman is the founder 
of the free software move-
ment, which has the goal of 
providing certain freedoms 
for software users, including 
the freedom to run a program, 
change a program’s source 
code, redistribute a program, 
and redistribute a program 
with your changes. Stallman 
argues that these freedoms are 
necessary for users to main-
tain control over the programs 
they run. He believes that pro-
grams without these freedoms 
can be instruments of unjust 
power, because the developer 
of the program can include 
malicious functionalities with-
out the user’s knowledge. Ma-
licious programs can snoop on 
users, track users, and restrict 
program functionalities.
There are many examples 
of this type of program. For 
instance, in 2009, Amazon, 
much to the shock of its users, 
deleted a version of George 
Orwell’s 1984 from all Kin-
dles without the permission 
of their owners. This angered 
many users and showed that 
Amazon had complete control 
over the devices. Another in-
stance occurred in 2010 when 
Sony released an update to the 
Play Station 3 that removed 
support for installing Linux. 
At its launch, Sony had touted 
the ability to install Linux on 
the PS3. Sony compelled users 
to update their systems by dis-
abling online features on con-
soles that were not updated. In 
2007, Microsoft updated nine 
small programs on machines 
running either Windows XP 
or Windows Vista without 
user approval. Although these 
changes proved to be benign, 
it showed that Microsoft has 
a universal back door through 
which anything on the user’s 
machine can be changed. In 
2013, Bloomberg reported 
that Microsoft shares infor-
mation with the NSA about 
vulnerabilities in its popular 
products before it ?xes them 
so that the NSA and other 
agencies can in?ltrate users’ 
computers.
After watching Stallman’s 
TED talk, members of Pug-
wash agreed with his argu-
ment that something has 
to be done about malicious 
programs, but many did not 
agree with his solution. Mem-
bers who were not technically 
focused felt quite helpless. If 
they couldn’t trust software 
developed by companies, why 
could they trust software de-
veloped by other program-
mers?
 More technically-minded 
members argued that, unlike 
companies, the open source 
community did not have a 
reason to write malicious pro-
grams. In fact, such a commu-
nity tends to be self-policing. 
However, this argument did 
not quell the concerns of many 
members.
Many members felt that 
Stallman understated the sac-
ri?ce of only using free soft-
ware. Free software can be of 
lower quality and is frequently 
designed for programmers 
rather than regular users. 
Many popular services use 
cloud-based programs, which 
by de?nition cannot be free 
software. By pretending that 
the sacri?ce of only using free 
software is quite small, Stall-
man perpetuates the alien-
ation non-programmers feel 
from the free software com-
munity.
Some members of Pugwash 
argued that the free software 
movement was the wrong 
method for preventing mali-
cious programs. Instead, they 
argued that governmental 
regulation of programs should 
prevent companies from pro-
viding malicious programs. 
Other members argued that 
this process was quite impossi-
ble, because of the monumen-
tal effort required to enforce 
such regulation.
All members of Pugwash 
agreed that malicious code 
was a serious problem. How-
ever, many felt quite helpless 
and disgruntled by the free 
software movement. The tech-
nological barriers to under-
standing and being able to do 
something about this problem 
continues to be an issue with-
out a simple solution.

and “the lever pulls a spring 
downward in a proportion to 
the weight.”
Through reverse engi-
neering, Mason and Just 
were able to take the data 
exhibited from the fMRI ma-
chine and deduce the under-
lying neurological processes 
that generate understand-
ing of such mechanics. “You 
see how it works, and you 
have to reason back to what 
mechanism would give you 
this pattern,” Just said. “For 
example, if we see activation 
in an area of the brain that 
is very commonly associated 
with visual imagery, we can 
say that they are forming 
some type of visual connec-
tion.”
This study also utilizes 
machine learning through 
the use of a “classi?er,” 
which takes in variables that 
form a relationship and, 
upon the presentation of 
new and unknown variables, 
will be able to classify where 
those new variables ?t into 
the mappings of data. 
In this particular appli-
cation, the machine is able 
to identify what people are 
thinking about in a precise 
manner. “The thought pat-
terns are speci?c to that 
system,” Just said. “So your 
activation pattern for when 
you think about a trumpet 
is different from when you 
think about a bathroom 
scale.” This classi?er essen-
tially allows scientists such 
as Just and Mason to accu-
rately measure the thought 
processes of people.
Both Mason and Just 
found the results from the 
classi?er as the most inter-
esting aspect of this study 
thus far. Mason explained 
that “the degree to which 
you can see similarities in 
knowledge representation 
across individuals” is both 
surprising and interesting. 
According to Just, since 
the classi?er analyzes multi-
ple individuals, the fact that 
it can identify similar results 
for all individuals shows 
that these patterns are uni-
form for all individuals. “All 
of our brains are organized 
in the same way,” Just said. 
For instance, autistic brains 
process information like con-
crete objects and emotions 
the same way as standard 
brains do, and the only dif-
ference between the two are 
thoughts in relation to social 
interaction. The way one 
understands how a hammer 
works or how the emotion of 
anger feels is the same across 
completely different back-
grounds.
Just explained that the 
brain categorizes learning 
these mechanical processes 
into four main parts. Before 
learning, the brain’s ac-
tions are “primarily visual.” 
As more detail is given, the 
brain transitions to a “mental 
animation” of how the sys-
tem works. The third stage 
involves a state known as 
“causal reasoning,” which is 
when the brain puts together 
visualizations to try and un-
derstand what causes certain 
reactions. The last step is 
known as “embodiment,” in 
which one would relate one’s 
own body to the system. So, 
for example, if a hammer was 
being described, the individ-
ual receiving this description 
would eventually connect his 
or her own dominant hand 
to a hammer and visualize 
or understand the use of the 
hammer from a personal 
perspective. Just theorizes 
that, even with abstract con-
cepts such as mathematics 
or theoretical physics, which 
humans cannot physically 
interact with, people still try 
to connect the body with the 
concept as a way to gain a 
better understanding of how 
it works.
Mason chose to use me-
chanical systems as the main 
focus for the study as a start-
ing point. “With many me-
chanical systems, we already 
know what the system does 
and how to use it, but unless 
we really look into it, often 
times we don’t know how 
something works.” 
He hopes that under-
standing the brain’s learning 
process will eventually trig-
ger curiosity in individuals 
and lead them to “think like 
little scientists.” 
Mason and Just’s research 
will continue to explore the 
relationship between learn-
ing and the brain, and they 
hope to expand the range 
of materials, as well as do-
mains of knowledge, in fu-
ture tests. Eventually, they 
would like to apply different 
training techniques that will 
apply to future classroom 
instructions.

professor discusses the policy 
debate concerning Science, 
Technology, Engineering, 
and Math (STEM) learning in 
the U.S. “I bring parents up 
to date with what I think they 
need to know about schools 
today and the STEM [strat-
egy],” said Nourbakhsh. 
“What it means, what the 
politics are behind it, and 
how schools use and misuse 
it.”
Aiming to improve its per-
formance among its foreign 
peers, the U.S. government 
has implemented programs 
including the No Child Left 
Behind Act and Race to the 
Top. In turn, there has been 
a push for accountability, a 
policy in which funding for 
schools depends upon the 
tested pro?ciencies of its 
students. However, as Nour-
bakhsh points out, such mea-
sure can have drawbacks.
“Diane Ravitch was an As-
sistant Secretary of Educa-
tion, and she was originally 
on the side for accountability. 
But what she discovered over 
time is that when you have 
these systems of account-
ability, it diverts the underly-
ing goal of learning. So now, 
you’re not using a test just to 
see how good somebody is at 
learning. 
You’re using the test as a 
guideline on what to teach,” 
said Nourbakhsh. “What real-
ly matters is that teachers can 
engage well with students, 
and cause a love of learning 
to blossom.”
The book then transitions 
into the topic of digital learn-
ing. In this section of the 
book, Nourbakhsh mentions 
examples of digital learning, 
including Massive Online 
Open Courses (MOOC’s), 
Khan Academy, and cognitive 
tutors. “I try to lay out some 
groundwork on what the 
digital learning system space 
looks like, its testing tools 
and the tools that your child 
can bene?t from,” said Nour-
bakhsh. “I also talk about 
some of the hype that you 
hear — like having a [digi-
tal] tutor that can solve all 
the problems that your child 
does in math class—and the 
subtleties that explain why 
this hype isn’t true.”
At the end of the book, 
Nourbakhsh also includes a 
preview of the second vol-
ume, which suggests activi-
ties that parents can do with 
their kids, from toddlers to 
teenagers. Activity ideas in-
clude watching car shows or 
identifying invasive species 
at local park conservancies. 
“In all those cases you’re 
teaching your child to iden-
tify something,” said Nour-
bakhsh. “That turns out to 
be a very important part of 
technological ?uency, which 
allows you to do things like 
program computers in the 
future.”
In keeping his ?rst volume 
to 64 pages, Nourbakhsh 
wanted to create a guide 
that parents could easily 
refer back to. During his re-
search for his book, he no-
ticed a dearth of books that 
discussed STEM and digital 
learning from an unbiased 
perspective.
 In addition, he also saw 
that there was very little con-
tent written to help parents 
understand the idea of STEM 
and standards within the ed-
ucation system.
“We’re entering an age 
where technology will be 
changing rapidly. We need 
more and more guides that 
help us make sense of that 
new age,” said Nourbakhsh. 
“And I hope my book is just 
one example of what we’re 
going to see several kinds of 
versions of in the future.”
In the coming weeks, free 
copies of his book will be dis-
tributed during a conference 
about technology ?uency for 
teaching and learning. In 
the meantime, Nourbakhsh 
is working on the second in-
stallment of his parenting 
book. He also maintains a 
blog that focuses on a pre-
dicted future, one in which 
robots will play a bigger part 
in the lives of human beings.
Beyond his achievements 
as a professional, at the end 
of the day, Nourbakhsh is a 
father who carries the strong 
belief that parents must be 
active participants in the 
learning development of 
their children. 
“You cannot outsource it 
to a computer, and you can-
not outsource it to the teach-
er,” he stated. “You have to be 
actively participating in that 
process if you want your kids 
to succeed.”

of dopamine, another stimu-
lating hormone, is also in-
creased. In other words, your 
beloved caffeine is not the 
real stimulant — it just tricks 
your body into releasing more 
of its natural stimulants.
Unfortunately for fre-
quent caffeine consum-
ers, the brain increases its 
amount of adenosine recep-
tors as it begins to notice caf-
feine hogging them. 
This is what causes people 
to develop a tolerance for 
caffeine. When coffee regu-
lars miss their daily dose, 
they experience withdrawal 
because the brain becomes 
overloaded with adenosine 
from all the extra adenosine 
receptors.
So now that you know 
how your coffee works, the 
next question to ask is wheth-
er it is good or bad for you. 
According to Rob van Dam, 
assistant professor in the 
Department of Nutrition at 
the Harvard School of Public 
Health and a coffee expert, 
there has been controversy 
over the topic because coffee 
is actually an extremely com-
plex drink that contains hun-
dreds of other compounds 
besides just caffeine. It is also 
sometimes dif?cult to sepa-
rate the effects of coffee from 
the effects of other lifestyle 
choices that coffee drinkers 
may have. 
However, by conducting 
studies on coffee’s in?uence 
on very speci?c health ef-
fects, researchers have found 
some trends.
The latest Harvard study, 
which also agrees with other 
recent research, seems to 
indicate that there is no re-
lationship between coffee 
consumption and increased 
risk of death from cancer or 
cardiovascular disease. 
In fact, some studies have 
even shown that coffee con-
sumption can reduce the risk 
of type 2 diabetes, Parkin-
son’s disease, liver cancer, 
and liver cirrhosis, although 
these studies merely demon-
strate correlation and do not 
con?rm causation. Of course, 
it is important to keep in 
mind that the subjects in 
these studies drank mostly 
black coffee or coffee with 
just a little bit of sugar and 
milk.
Overall, the consensus 
among the scienti?c com-
munity is that, unless you 
are drinking to the point that 
you have tremors or chronic 
insomnia, coffee is not detri-
mental to your health.
So keep working on get-
ting that Starbucks Gold Card 
— the rewards might not only 
include free drinks, but some 
extra health bene?ts.

Well-balanced roster fuels Pirates’ division crown hopes
Women’s tennis
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s tennis team improved to 
11–3 on the season with a 9–0 
home win over Grove City Col-
lege at the start of last week 
on March 23. Seniors Bryn 
Raschke and Angela Pratt won 
8–3, senior Lydia Utkin and 
?rst-year Kalyani Narayan 
took their match 8–2.
Juniors Elizabeth Martin 
and Brooke Tsu shut out their 
opposition 8–0 in doubles 
play. The Tartans continued 
their sweep, winning all six 
singles matches. Pratt won 
6–1, 6–1 at the top of the lad-
der.
Sophomore Nicholle Tor-
res won 6–2, 6–0 in the second 
slot. Junior Abbey Hamstra 
also won a singles match 6–2, 
6–0 in the fourth slot.
The team’s success did not 
carry to Saturday, however, 
as they were beaten 5–4 by 
No. 10 Washington and Lee 
University. The Tartans were 
swept in doubles play and 
could not recover in time to 
take the match.
Sophomore Vanessa Pavia 
was able to win her match, 
which forced a 4–4 tie, but the 
deciding match went to Wash-
ington and Lee, dropping the 
Tartans to 11–4.
The Tartans ?nished the 
weekend 11–5 after losing to 
Williams University on Sun-
day afternoon.
The women’s tennis team 
will next play on April 4, when 
they host the University of 
Mary Washington.
Men’s tennis
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
tennis team continued their 
success this season, sweeping 
Grove City College on March 
23 and beating Washington 
and Lee University on Satur-
day to move to a 9–6 record 
for the season. Senior Bryce 
Beisswanger and junior Yu-
vraj Kumar took their match 
8-0, while senior Christian 
Heaney-Secord and ?rst-year 
Jeffrey Chen won 8–0 as well. 
First-years Matt Seifert and 
Andrew Pratt rounded out the 
sweep of doubles play, taking 
an 8–1 victory.
Junior Abhishek Alla won 
his match 6–0, 6–0, sopho-
more Kunal Wadwani took his 
match 6–2, 6–1, and ?rst-year 
Tommy Cheng won 6–2, 6–3, 
all contributing to the 9–0 
overall victory.
The match against Wash-
ington and Lee was much of 
the same. The Tartans took 
two of three matches in dou-
bles play, with Beisswanger 
and Kumar winning 8–5 while 
Wadwani and sophomore 
Kenny Zheng swept their 
match, 8–0.
In singles play, senior Will 
Duncan and sophomore Kiril 
Kirkov won 6–2, 6–3, and 6–2, 
6–0, respectively, leading the 
Tartans to a 6–3 overall vic-
tory.
The men’s team rolled to 
another victory on Sunday, 
sweeping Christopher New-
port University 9–0 to move to 
11–6.
The men’s tennis team will 
continue their season April 4, 
when they host Case Western 
Reserve University.

As the baseball season 
starts next week, the Pirates 
have the opportunity to build 
on a recent run of success that 
resulted in two straight post-
season appearances after a 
torturous multi-decade stretch 
without seeing postseason 
baseball. The Cardinals look 
weakened, the Cubs are rely-
ing on a lot to go right, and the 
Pirates are in a great position 
to win the National League 
(NL) Central for the ?rst time 
ever.
This Pirates team’s abil-
ity to win a ton of games this 
year will start with a very tal-
ented assortment of position 
players. From the out?eld 
in, the Pirates sport a lot of 
strengths in the ?eld with very 
few standout weaknesses. In 
a competitive NL Central, this 
combination of depth and top-
shelf talent could be the differ-
ence over the course of a long 
season.
The most striking concen-
tration of talent on the Pirates 
is in the out?eld. Pittsburgh 
is the only team in the league 
that can rival the Miami Mar-
lins consensus top trio outside 
the diamond. While the most 
obvious name in the out?eld 
is center ?elder and 2013 MVP 
Andrew McCutchen, the cor-
ner out?elders should not be 
forgotten. 
Left ?elder Starling Marte 
is a very toolsy player, near the 
top of the league in his ability 
to get on base, cover lots of 
territory, run the bases, throw 
from the out?eld and, when 
he gets hot, absolutely crush 
the baseball. He is criminally 
underrated every year and 
has given the Pirates a mas-
sive boost in his time with the 
team.
In the other corner, right 
?elder Gregory Polanco 
should begin to deliver on his 
promise as a prospect after a 
lukewarm rookie season. Once 
a common mention among 
Baseball America top pros-
pects, Polanco did not mash as 
many expected him to, when 
he came into the league. He 
struggled to get on base and 
hit for power, which put some 
giant gashes in his numbers. 
However, the jump from the 
minor leagues to the majors 
is a tough one, and the spring 
training results have been en-
couraging. 
Some ground balls have 
been turning into line drives 
and ?y balls, which are more 
likely to turn into hits, and Po-
lanco is a prime breakout can-
didate in 2015.
The in?eld outlook is a bit 
less rosy, but not much of a 
weakness. The corners of the 
in?eld are well taken care 
of. After a down season, ?rst 
baseman Pedro Alvarez’s pow-
er numbers should bounce 
back to somewhere close to 
his 2013 heights, and his abil-
ity to get on base and get extra 
base hits were improvements 
over previous season’s results. 
Alvarez is absolutely destroy-
ing spring training, and the 
power is showing again. He 
may not hit 36 home runs this 
year, but he could reach 25–30 
and be a huge boon for the Pi-
rates offense.
At the hot corner, third 
baseman Josh Harrelson 
looks to build on a breakout 
year where his versatility and 
range of skills both offensively 
and defensively made him 
extremely valuable wherever 
manager Clint Hurdle needed 
him on the ?eld. There was 
nothing in his peripherals to 
imply that his season was a 
?uke, and he should continue 
both hitting well and closing 
off the foul line at third base. 
The middle in?eld will be held 
down by Neil Walker, possibly 
the league’s best offensive sec-
ond baseman after the Mari-
ners’ second baseman Robin-
son Cano, and Jordy Mercer, 
a satisfactory but uninspiring 
option at shortstop. The two 
are a decent defensive double 
play combination, and Neil 
Walker can hit well enough for 
the both of them. The Pirates’ 
in?eld should be above aver-
age, even if it isn’t spectacular.
The Pirates’ rotation might 
scare off those who support 
them, with starters Francisco 
Liriano and Gerrit Cole being 
the only players set to have 
above average seasons. Both 
of them are high variance 
pitchers, however, and the ro-
tation will certainly be a weak-
ness. The return of starter A.J. 
Burnett does little to move the 
needle. If anything will undo 
the Pirates, it is the rotation. 
However, an excellent defen-
sive team and decent starters 
should not cause too much 
of a leak, and this should not 
overwhelm the Pirates’ ex-
cellent offense. The bullpen, 
including closer Mark Melan-
con, also goes deep and can 
help ease the dif?culties of the 
rotation.
Finally, the competition 
is not as good as everyone 
thinks. The Brewer’s ?rst-half 
?uky success is not replicable, 
and they should not be a fac-
tor.
With ?rst baseman Joey 
Votto not returning to his for-
mer self, the Reds could po-
tentially be one of the worst 
teams in the league and will 
probably deal starter Johnny 
Cueto by the trade deadline. 
The Cubs will be very good 
in the near future, but it is silly 
to expect all of their prospects 
to turn into stars overnight, 
and players like starter Jake 
Arietta might regress. The 
addition of starter Jon Lester 
should not ?ip the script for 
the Cubs overnight.
Finally, the mighty Cardi-
nals were not better than the 
Pirates last year, and would 
not have won the division 
without several absences 
from McCutchen. With many 
of their best players begin-
ning to age, the Cardinals are 
more susceptible to bad injury 
luck than the Pirates, and the 
Cardinals offense is not very 
deep, with only a few players 
providing more than average 
offense. Right ?elder Jason 
Heyward, the Cardinals’ big 
off-season acquisition, does 
not offer much in the way of 
offense, and left ?elder Matt 
Holiday is set for a major de-
cline.
The door is open for the 
Pirates. With the Cubs on the 
rise and the Cardinals trend-
ing down, it is the perfect 
time. It could be now or never 
to grab an NL Central title 
with this core.

Ultimate teams set to aim for the stars at College Series
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
Despite inclement weather 
leading to a series of cancella-
tions, Carnegie Mellon’s only 
Division I sports teams have 
rolled to successful seasons. 
The Money Mellons and Mr. 
Yuk, respectively the women’s 
and men’s ultimate frisbee 
teams, are approaching the 
2015 College Series, their 
postseason. With some wins 
and some impressively close 
losses against top competi-
tion, both squads are looking 
to build on their performanc-
es and gain some success at 
regionals.
The Money Mellons, 
ranked 65 in the nation, 
started their season with lofty 
goals. “At regionals, we’ve got-
ten sixth, max,” said senior 
captain Lauren Miller, a senior 
business administration and 
statistics double major. “We 
want to top that.”
In order to achieve this 
goal, the team has been try-
ing to develop a deep and 
balanced team, with each of 
the 25 players capable of ?ll-
ing many on–?eld roles. Each 
player needs to be skilled and 
con?dent to give the team the 
ability to reach their goals.
The team has had some on–
?eld success as well, ?nishing 
in the top four in each of their 
fall tournaments. Their ?rst 
tournament, the Theodore 
Seuss Geisel Memorial Ulti-
mate Tournament, resulted in 
a third place ?nish and a 7–1 
record, including a key victory 
over McMaster University, 
a Canadian college. Despite 
windy conditions that made 
it tough for both teams, the 
Money Mellons were able to 
win a back and forth game on 
the strength of an aggressive 
attack.
Their next tournament, 
North Coast, ended with a sec-
ond place ?nish after a close ?-
nal with Ohio State University, 
last year’s national champion. 
A late 6–0 run brought the 
Money Mellons close, but they 
couldn’t overcome the de?cit 
and narrowly lost 13–10.
Their season continued 
with a fourth place ?nish at 
the Fall Brawl in Columbus, 
Ohio.
A 5–2 record included a 
15–1 beatdown of regional 
rivals Case Western Reserve 
University. The team ?nished 
fourth after an overtime loss 
to  Michigan State University.
The Money Mellons’ ?rst 
spring tournament was hit 
hard by snow, causing a large 
number of teams to drop 
out. They went 3–3 at the 
tournament.
Mr. Yuk also found some 
success in the fall. The team 
played the University of Pitts-
burgh, national champions in 
two of the last three years, to a 
back and forth 15–10 loss after 
Pitt pulled away in the closing 
moments. The next day, Mr. 
Yuk took down the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, with the 
help of senior mechanical en-
gineering major Alec Assaad 
who hit senior captain and 
senior mechanical engineer-
ing and public policy student 
Reid Almand with a deep pass 
to take the match 13–12.
Like the Money Mellons, 
Mr. Yuk has focused largely on 
building the team.
“After graduating 75 per-
cent of the team in 2013, last 
year was spent building a 
strong rookie class,” said Al-
mand.
This year, with another 
strong freshman class, Mr. Yuk 
is set up for long term success. 
The team is currently prepar-
ing for Conferences, the ?rst 
installment of the College Se-
ries.
The team’s goal is to ad-
vance beyond there.
“It’s all about peaking at 
the right time,” said Almand, 
“And a Cinderella run to Na-
tionals is always in the back of 
our minds.”
The team is not limited to 
organized play either. 
After a tournament in 
Washington, D.C. was can-
celled the morning of, Mr. Yuk 
played scrimmages with Princ-
eton University and George 
Washington University, tak-
ing both matches, which were 
played directly on the National 
Mall.
With the College Series 
beginning in mid-April, both 
teams have plenty of time to 
shake off the cancellations 
and snow-covered tourna-
ments to build on early season 
successes and put together 
some postseason victories.
Host Australia tops Black Caps for Cricket World Cup win
ABHINAV GAUTAM
Photo Editor
Australian bowler Mitch-
ell Starc bowled the ?fth ball 
of the day and clean bowled 
wicket keeper Brendon Mc-
Cullum, the New Zealand 
captain, for a zero. The record 
crowd of 93,000 at the Mel-
bourne Cricket Ground roared 
as Australia got their ?rst 
wicket in the ?rst over, leaving 
New Zealand one for one.
Over the last month and 
half, 14 nations have played 
48 matches at the 11th Cricket 
World Cup, jointly hosted by 
Australia and New Zealand for 
the second time (last time be-
ing in 1992). The 2015 World 
Cup marked the ?rst time Af-
ghanistan’s cricket team quali-
?ed for the tournament. Three 
associate nations — Ireland, 
Scotland, and United Arab 
Emirates — will play with the 
full member nations of the 
International Cricket Council 
(ICC): England, South Africa, 
India, Australia, Sri Lanka, 
Pakistan, West Indies, Bangla-
desh, New Zealand, and Zim-
babwe.
Despite a valiant effort 
by associate nations, the ex-
pected full member teams 
led Group Stage matches and 
quali?ed for the quarter ?nal. 
After the close, nerve-wrack-
ing ?rst semi?nal match, the 
New Zealand cricket team 
defeated South Africa, contin-
ued their perfect World Cup 
winning streak and secured 
their place in the ?nal for the 
?rst time. Australia had only 
lost to New Zealand in a very 
close, yet thrilling match in 
the Group Stage. But they 
pulled out a dominant win 
over India, previous World 
Cup winner and one of the fan 
favorites, in the semi?nal and 
claimed their spot in the ?nal 
for the seventh time.
Once again, the co-hosts 
of the World Cup were the 
contenders for the ?nal match 
this Sunday. New Zealand was 
the team in best form without 
any doubts this World Cup. 
The team played aggressive, 
attacking games. With excel-
lent leadership by McCullum, 
batsman Martin Guptil’s high 
scores, all-rounder Daniel Vet-
tori’s good form, and opening 
bowler Trent Boult taking the 
most wickets in the tourna-
ment, New Zealand had good 
chances for their ?rst World 
Cup victory. Meanwhile, Aus-
tralia was no lesser of a team. 
Having a strong home-?eld 
advantage — winning 24 
matches of its last 26 match-
es at home — the Australian 
team has a penchant for at-
tacking and winning World 
Cups, having won four out of 
the six ?nals. Australian cap-
tain and batsman Michael 
Clarke set beautifully crafted 
?elds to get the wickets and 
changed his batting order to 
score the most runs possible. 
Along with the strong top 
batting order including bats-
men David Warner and Steve 
Smith, the Australians would 
de?nitely give New Zealand 
bowlers a challenge. Though 
their only shortcoming is the 
lack of a quality spinner, the 
Australian bowling side gets 
along ?ne with both Mitchell 
Starc — the highest wicket 
taker so far in the tournament 
— and Mitchell Johnson in 
great shape.
The Melbourne pitch was 
expected to be bouncy, but 
also batsman-friendly as 
most of the pitches have been 
throughout the tournament 
for record-breaking scores. 
With no rain forecasted, the 
?nal match of the 2015 World 
Cup began on a bright, sunny 
Australian afternoon. Starc 
started the bowling attack 
with fast and full bowling. 
With McCullum gone for a 
duck in the ?rst over, the day 
of the bowlers started. With 
the ?rst opener gone, New 
Zealand continued to play 
safely and was struck down 
by high-quality pace bowl-
ing from Starc, bowler Josh 
Hazelwood, and Johnson. At 
the end of the ?rst ten overs 
New Zealand stood 31 for one, 
its lowest 10-over score this 
World Cup. Luck was not on 
New Zealand’s side as it lost 
Guptill soon afterwards for 15 
and Williamson for 12. Stand-
ing 41 for three for at end of 
the 14th over, Grant Elliott and 
Ross Taylor gave some hope to 
the Black Caps as they scored 
111 in their partnership. How-
ever, a determined Australia 
got the breakthrough they 
needed at the start of the 
power play, getting Taylor out 
through an appeal. Soon two 
more wickets fell down and 
New Zealand was at 165 for 
six at the end of the 40th over 
with Elliott still standing, but 
playing more cautiously. This 
did not last long as Johnson 
took another wicket and Aus-
tralian bowler James Faulkner 
soon took the ?nal big wicket 
of Elliott. Twelve runs were 
scored afterwards as New Zea-
land collapsed at 183 all out 
with Johnson and Faulkner 
both taking three wickets each 
and Starc helping with two 
wickets and very tight bowl-
ing. Despite losing the toss, 
the Australians had a good 
chance of the winning another 
World Cup title as they went 
into the lunch break.
New Zealand began with a 
similarly impressive opening 
over by claiming the wicket 
of Aaron Finch and leaving 
the Aussies with two for one. 
However, batsman DA Warner 
carried the next ten overs by 
hitting seven fours and giving 
the edge to the Australians 
despite being two down for 63 
at the end of 12th over. Now 
Clarke came in and played a 
captain’s innings. Along with 
Smith, the duo scored the 
highest partnership of the day 
with 112 runs. Clarke hit ten 
fours and one six before ?-
nally getting bowled out for 74 
by New Zealand bowler Matt 
Henry. He did not get to hit 
the winning runs, but his half 
century got Australia close to 
a easy win with just short of 
nine runs. As Clarke left the 
MCG, he deserved a standing 
ovation for playing a true cap-
tain’s innings and for this ?nal 
being his last One Day Inter-
national Match. Only twelve 
more balls were needed, as 
Smith whirled an unorthodox 
hit for four and Australia won 
the World Cup ?nal by seven 
wickets.
The Aussies rushed onto 
the ?eld and got into a group 
hug for a deserving win. Clos-
ing ceremonies soon followed 
with Clarke feeling “over the 
moon” and said that New Zea-
land are always a tough team 
to beat in any sport. McCullum 
felt that though 183 was too 
short, it was still an approach-
able dream.
However, he and the New 
Zealand team were in high 
spirits as McCullum ended 
saying “[we] didn’t lift the tro-
phy but no regrets [about] the 
brand of cricket we’ve played 
and we walk away with our 
heads held high.”
Faulkner picked up the 
Man of the Match for his 36 
for three ?nish. Starc received 
the Man of the Tournament 
award for amassing reverse-
swinging yorkers and 22 wick-
ets throughout the tourna-
ment. As the Australian team 
picked up the trophy, they 
became the ?rst team to have 
won the World Cup on all ?ve 
continents in which cricket is 
played. They went for the vic-
tory lap around the stadium as 
the fans were still roaring from 
the win.  The team appropri-
ately dedicated their win to 
batsman Phillip Hughes, who 
had died after being struck on 
the neck by a ball in Sydney in 
November.

Peanut butter rice krispies
Try making these easy indulgences with marshmallows
This week’s article is dedicated to all those out 
there with a sweet tooth who will be celebrating 
Passover next week. 
Back in high school, I would celebrate “Cupcake 
Wednesday” every week with my friends at 
lunch. Each Tuesday night I would sit down with 
Martha Stewart, Betty Crocker, and some of my 
blogger best friends to find the perfect cupcake 
to bring in the next day. Except, I always forgot 
about Passover each time it came around. My 
friend Abby London was always left without a 
cupcake, and I felt so bad!
This year, even though I won’t be around to 
actually give her a special treat, I’m dedicating 
this recipe to her.
Just because leavening is off the table doesn’t 
mean that dessert has to be, too. I found this 
recipe when I fell down the rabbit hole of 
Pinterest. I like that it’s not only a really fun, 
unexpected flavor that brings back memories of 
elementary school packed lunches, but it’s also 
really quick and easy to make!
The gist of this recipe? Take the blank canvas 
of Rice Krispies treats that’s already almost as 
perfect as can be, and then add peanut butter. 
Marshmallow and peanut butter are such a great 
flavor combination that can only get better with 
the added crunch of the cereal and richness from 
the butter.
Fluffer Nutter Rice Krispy Treats
1/4 cup of unsalted butter
1 10-ounce bag of regular sized marshmallows
1/2 cup of peanut butter
5 cups of crispy rice cereal
1 1/4 cups of mini marshmallows
1 bag of Reese’s peanut butter chips
1 or 2 bags of mini Reese’s cups
Instructions
1) First things first: Either coat a 9x13 pan 
with cooking spray or line the pan with some 
parchment paper.
2) Melt butter in a pretty large pot over low heat. 
Then pour in the marshmallows. They’ll start to 
soften and eventually just melt into a soft shiny 
cream that will be tempting to dig into with 
nothing but a spoon and what little pride you 
might have left. But wait. Next, add in the peanut 
butter. It, too, will melt into the marshmallow 
butter sauce. It also might turn you on a little. 
Before your stimulated senses lead you astray, 
take it off the heat.
3) Before this concoction has too much time to 
cool down, stir in the cereal and make sure it’s 
evenly distributed so you don’t have any really 
sad pockets of dry cereal with globs of peanut 
butter elsewhere. Then when the mix is cool but 
not set, stir in the mini marshmallows by hand. 
This step is optional if you would rather not 
complicate things too much, but it really adds 
some fun to each bite! The marshmallow flavor 
can get buried under the peanut butter, so the 
mini ’mallows throughout really help to give that 
flavor a boost!
4) Dump the treats out into the pan, but don’t 
press down too hard while evening it out. 
After that, melt the peanut butter chips in the 
microwave at 30 second intervals, stirring in 
between. Spread the melted chips out across the 
treats, and before that hardens, sprinkle the mini 
Reese’s cups over the top: If you can bear it, try 
to wait at least a half hour for everything to set. It 
will be so worth it in the end. Because truly, these 
will blow your mind. AND they’re Kosher!
Looking for a few more Passover-
appropriate dessert options? More kosher 
options (without nuts)?
Anything fruity is a great option! You could make 
any kind of fruit salad that your heart desires, 
or even a parfait. Layer some awesome seasonal 
fruits with any flavor yogurt or pudding in cups 
for yourself or your Seder guests. For an added 
treat, you can soak the fruits in some orange juice 
and sugar for an hour or so. This will make them 
extra juicy and flavorful.
Desserts that use egg whites also leave you with 
so many great choices. You can treat yourselves 
to some macaroons, meringues or even pavlovas! 
These are a little tricky to make, but store bought 
is usually still a great option.
You can also stick with a classic and indulge your 
sweet tooth with some Matzo. You can make an 
ice cream sandwich, spread some Nutella and top 
it with bananas, or my favorite — s’mores!

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
I’m a recent graduate and 
I have a bit of a dilemma; 
I could use your sage 
advice. The Stockholm 
syndrome has started 
to kick in, and I find 
that I’m starting to miss 
CMU. Now don’t get me 
wrong, I’m happy to be 
free from the stress and 
the homework, but I miss 
things like weird people 
and the freedom to be 
weird. I know I could get 
my dose of nostalgia and 
whatnot by coming to 
Carnival, but therein lays 
the problem. 
Adulthood has captured 
the free time and finances 
of my friends and former 
classmates, and I find 
I have no one to go to 
Carnival with. I would be 
down to go alone, maybe, 
but I don’t want to come 
off as the desperate alum 
trying to relive her youth, 
and I don’t want to pay 
a good chunk of change 
and fly across the country 
only to be that creepy 
person at Carnival who 
roams around by herself. 
So, should I just get up 
early and watch Buggy in 
my PJs, or should I come 
to Carnival?
Best,
Nostalgic for Imbibing 
Cool, Opulent Liquors in 
English Department
Dear NICOLE’D,
You sound familiar. Do I 
know you from somewhere?
In any case, I congratulate 
you. You’re the first person 
to write in this school 
year that writes in an 
intelligible manner! You 
deserve accolades, flowers, 
smatterings of applause.
But yeah, adulthood 
sucks. As a second-
semester senior, I should 
be celebrating loudly and 
fervently, but instead I 
feel this creeping wave 
of exhaustion and 
apprehension of what’s 
to come — I have to take 
responsibility for my own 
life, my choices, my budget. 
Perish the thought!
It seems like you’re feeling 
pretty lonely, too, so there’s 
only really one remedy for 
that: Come to Carnival. 
Screw the cost, and screw 
the people you think will 
look at you a little funny for 
being the alum wandering 
through the third-year-in-a-
row Pirates of the Caribbean 
booth behind the group of 
tittering freshmen girls — it’ll 
be worth it. You know it’ll be 
worth it.
People aren’t going to care, 
anyway — they’ll be too 
busy trying not to be seen 
buying their fifth basket of 
deep-fried Oreos in a day.
Buggy in PJs still sounds 
fun, though,

This past Saturday, residents of the Carnegie Mellon 
community braved the cold to attend the inaugural 
Margaret Morrison Food Truck Block Party. There 
were several different food trucks present, including 
some old Carnegie Mellon favorites like Joe’s 
Doghouse, Tartans’ Express, and India on Wheels, 
as well as some new and exciting options from 
businesses in the Pittsburgh area. The event kicked 
off promptly at noon with live performances from 
groups including East End Mile, Ethan Bence, Arts 
Greenhouse, and The Treblemakers. In addition to 
the food and live performances, there were a variety 
of games available to the partygoers, such as “Pin-
the-Tie on Suresh!” 
These performances, games, and exciting new 
food trucks were sure to present students with a 
promising afternoon. However, in addition to these 
events, there were also long lines. Though slightly 
overwhelming at first, it took more than these long 
lines and cold winds to keep everyone away from the 
food. 
First up on our food truck journey was Mac and Gold, 
Pittsburgh’s Original Mac ‘n’ Cheesery.  Although 
the line seemed quite long at first glance, we moved 
along at an impressive pace. We opted for the 
Barbeque Beef Brisket Mac n’ Cheese. Simply put, it 
was delicious. The perfectly cheesy mac and cheese 
was topped with barbeque brisket and crispy French 
fried onions. The other options, including the roasted 
butternut squash mac and cheese and the prosciutto 
and pea mac and cheese, also received positive 
reviews. The short wait time coupled with the great 
food made Mac and Gold a true crowd pleaser. 
Despite the cold weather, we were still greeted 
with happy and friendly faces by those working in 
the Bella Christie and Lil Z’s Sweet Boutique food 
truck. Bella Christie’s offered a variety of tasty 
treats, including cookies, cupcakes, cake pops, 
and all things chocolate-covered. The treats were 
very inexpensive, beautifully decorated, and quite 
delicious. We chose the chocolate covered Oreos, 
and were not in any way disappointed. The best part 
was the food truck’s lack of any line whatsoever. 
The Sweet Boutique quickly became a block party 
favorite.
Franktuary, which offered up classic hot dogs and 
fries, also became one of our favorites — taste wise, 
that is. The food was great, but getting to the food 
was a different story. The line, which appeared to 
be fairly short, looked promising at first. We were 30 
minutes into waiting when we realized it might take 
slightly longer than previously estimated to acquire 
one of Franktuary’s grass-fed all-beef hotdogs. The 
bitter cold got the best of some of those waiting in 
line, but 45 minutes into waiting, we decided we 
had gone too far to back out now. We envied those in 
the fast-moving Mac and Gold queue as we waited, 
and waited, and waited. Eventually our order was 
placed after a wait time totaling one hour and 45 
minutes. However, after receiving our food, we finally 
understood why so many others had waited this long 
for hot dogs and French fries — they were delicious. 
Although the wait was not ideal, it turned out to be a 
small price to pay.
Judging by the exceptionally long line at Taco Cho’s, 
which offered Korean Mexican Fusion style tacos, 
one might have assumed that it was a crowd favorite. 
But when we asked a fellow student, first-year 
materials science and engineering major Indorica 
Sutradhar, about her experience at Taco Cho’s, she 
described her tacos as “kind of cold” and “just okay.” 
Unfortunately, we heard similar responses from 
several others, as many found the tacos lackluster 
and not worth the wait. Perhaps the tent setup, as 
opposed to the standard food truck option, caused

Van Gogh exhibit doesn’t reach potential
Visiting van Gogh an interesting addition to an afternoon at the Carnegie Institute of Art
There are some art exhibits you can get lost in, wander 
for hours, feel time slip away as you move between 
paintings.
Visiting van Gogh, now on view at the Carnegie 
Museum of Art (CMOA), is not one of them.
Not from a lack of interesting material — to its credit, 
the exhibit does what it can with only four paintings 
on display. But despite being the museum’s main visit-
ing exhibition, it’s better suited as a stop on a longer 
visit, not a main attraction.
The exhibit is contained to a small, peripheral room 
adjacent to the museum’s permanent collections. 
Security guards are badgered by guests who ask, “Is 
there another room? Is this really all?”
It’s easy to make the mistake of judging quality by 
quantity. The CMOA has pulled off highly interesting 
exhibits with only a few actual art works in the past. 
Just last June through September, Faked, Forgotten, 
Found was a brilliant and engaging exhibit detailing 
the journeys of four — yes, four — original paintings 
across centuries, between owners, and among forger-
ies of varying persuasiveness.
It’s been done before, but not here. Visiting van Gogh 
is interesting in an understated way, but it doesn’t 
seem to fully capitalize on the material it has or the 
incredibly recognizable name that accompanies it.
The first painting isn’t van Gogh’s. It’s his contempo-
rary Paul Signac’s “Place des Lices, St. Tropez” — a 
pointillist work in golden yellow and orange offset by 
blue and green. A man sits on a bench in the shade of 
big-bowed trees with thick, undulating trunks and pur-
ple-spotted branches winding up to a swirl of green-
blue foliage. There’s something distinctly van Gogh in 
the curving edge of the foliage, the leaves gathering in 
perfect, thoughtful circles, reminiscent of the whirling 
clouds in van Gogh’s “The Starry Night.”
Other than the friendship and clear influence between 
Signac and van Gogh, the painting’s inclusion isn’t 
well explained. The exposition describes Signac’s 
belief that certain colors evoked corresponding emo-
tions — an idea with which van Gogh, too, experi-
mented — but not much else related to the titular art-
ist. In a larger exhibit, it’s common and enlightening to 
include the work of the main artist’s contemporaries — 
but in such a small exhibit, and with a weak apparent 
tie to the other three paintings, the Signac just seems 
out of place.
The painting helps to inform, however, the series of 
color theory information panels and activities on the 
adjacent wall. These panels detail a history of color 
theory from Sir Isaac Newton’s original 1660 black-and-
white color wheel to the divisionist movement, which 
explored how separate dots of color interact optically 
when viewed together. The exposition sheds interest-
ing light on the philosophy behind van Gogh’s legend-
ary work and offers a lens for viewing the remaining 
three paintings.
Most interestingly, the museum recreated van Gogh’s 
caddy full of balls of yarn, explaining how the artist 
once sat facing the open box, twisting together yarn 
strands of different colors to see how the colors inter-
acted optically before juxtaposing them in his paint-
ings. We often remember van Gogh as the crazed man 
who sliced off his own ear, à la Kirk Douglas’s tortured 
portrayal in Lust for Life. It’s hard to imagine the artist 
sitting at a desk, winding yarn, pairing colors experi-
mentally and thoughtfully. The yarn box an important 
reminder that planning, not just haphazard genius, 
plays into every great artist’s work.
The remainder of the exhibit takes us through van 
Gogh’s evolution from struggling twenty-something to 
Parisian resident to established artist poised to leave 
a legacy when he died in 1890. Van Gogh’s painting 
career didn’t start until the mid-1880s — toward the 
end of his life, during which he was extremely prolific. 
Though the original painting isn’t featured, the CMOA 
provides an image of van Gogh’s 1885 “The Potato 
Eaters” — a dark, realist painting in what was briefly 
van Gogh’s style before his art dealer brother recom-
mended the lighter palette of the French impressioists.
An immediate contrast, “Le Moulin de la Galette” — 
the second featured painting — was created only a 
year later, but stylistically, couldn’t be more different. 
The tranquil, bucolic scene of windmill and chicken 
coop is characterized by soft greens and blues, the 
windmill blades barely sketched: You can imagine the 
tip of the brush just skimming the canvas. It’s still far 
removed from his later impressionist influences, but 
closer to his familiar pastel-dominated palette.
Van Gogh’s “Still Life, Basket of Apples” shows the 
artist grudgingly emulating some of his impressionist 
peers. The strokes are thicker, deliberate, even exces-
sive compared to “Le Moulin de la Galette.” The crim-
son-outlined weave of the basket is swathed in heavy 
strokes of yellow and blue, lending the painting circu-
lar, swaddling movement. It’s clearly an early experi-
ment, but it looks more like the van Gogh we know.
The final work in the exhibit, 1890’s “Wheat Fields 
After the Rain,” is van Gogh in his full glory. Thick, 
strong layers of green and yellow create linear move-
ment in grass and the landscape stretching away from 
the viewer — strokes so thick that they cast shadows 
underneath them. It’s not just green, though: Mint, 
grass, lime, pine, teal, and turquoise complement and 
offset each other. Spots of white and red sketch indis-
tinct wildflowers in the foreground, while wide robin’s-
egg-blue curves depict clouds and sky overhead.
Though beautiful and focal to the exhibit, the place-
ment of “Wheat Fields” is sudden after a four-year 
gap in van Gogh’s artistic career after “Le Moulin,” 
during which he was allegedly his most prolific, and 
yet the museum features no further works from this 
period. After “Wheat Fields,” viewers are left with a 
jarring and unsatisfying description of how the artist 
succumbed to suicide shortly after that painting was 
finished. It’s an unsettling transition, especially as we 
had been so carefully guided through the artist’s early 
stages, and yet we’re left to imagine what seemed like 
his most defining years. More exposition to ease the 
chronology would have been welcome.
If you’re a University of Pittsburgh or Carnegie Mellon 
student with free admission,Visting van Gogh alone 
may be worth the 10-minute walk down the street. But 
if you’re a non-affiliate, group this exhibit with others 
you’d like to see.

Ten years ago, a massive TV phenomenon began. This 
program marked the beginning of ShondaLand and 
the rise of medical TV shows in primetime American 
television broadcasting. A year prior, FOX began airing 
a medical procedural drama which became a massive 
success: Grey’s Anatomy. Before that, ABC produced 
Scrubs, a more comedic take on medical television, but 
broadcast it through NBC. Shonda Rhimes decided to 
make the show by mixing elements from other programs. 
She was able to develop a program that has accurate 
medicine in it, some procedural aspects to certain 
episodes, and an overarching story that centers on 
Meredith Grey and her colleagues. Through the years, 
the program has evolved, bringing in new characters and 
focusing more on the ensemble. After 11 seasons, the 
show has returned to its origins: it is more about Meredith 
than any other season in the show’s history.
With a marked absence from Derek (her husband) and 
Cristina (her person), the show has been able to take 
Meredith Grey out of her comfort zone and push her into 
situations where she has been forced to develop more 
completely as a character. This is part of what makes 
Grey’s Anatomy such an excellent show. Through the 
years, we have seen their relationship go through many 
obstacles and states of being. The actors, Ellen Pompeo 
and Patrick Dempsey, have shown palpable chemistry 
from the onset of the series, and their relationship has 
blossomed from Derek’s runaway affair to a loving 
marriage bound by a Post-It. This marriage has been 
struggling for the past two seasons with Meredith trying 
to have time for advancing her career and Derek feeling 
stuck in his. From the beginning of Season 11, Derek 
was itching to leave for Washington, D.C. (which he 
ends up doing), which basically made Meredith choose 
between doing what she loved in the place she has called 
home for most of her life, or follow Derek to Washington, 
D.C. and risk everything she has worked hard to 
achieve. Ultimately, she stays in Seattle and continues 
her marriage to Derek, bringing the hardships of long-
distance relationships to the show.
Meanwhile, Meredith is also struggling because she has 
lost the most important relationship she has had since 
the inception of the program. Since Dr. Cristina Yang 
moved from Seattle, Meredith lost her “person.” This loss 
is suffered much more than the current state of her other 
relationships because she and Cristina had been through 
the same experiences at the same pace and struggled 
with very similar problems. Through those struggles they 
had created a bond that was essential for both of them; 
with that bond, they knew they could count on each 
other at all times. Feeling left outside of her comfort zone, 
without anyone to fall back on, she focuses on her work 
and her relationships with the rest of her colleagues. 
This season has also shown Meredith ?nding herself by 
delving into her past and the writings of her deceased 
mother. She does this not for herself, but for her newfound 
half-sister. The writers of this show have a knack for 
introducing stories that ?t perfectly with the backstories 
of other characters and indulging the need for characters 
that shift focus, change relationships, and bring with 
them an entire trunk full of baggage.
This season has highlighted how alone Meredith feels and 
how much more driven she has become through it all. In 
the last episode she broke her streak; she had gone more 
than one month without a patient of hers dying. As some 
of you probably know, as an attending general surgeon 
of a high-pro?le hospital, there is a high probability that 
at least one of your patients will die during a shift. This is 
especially true if the hospital is prone to natural disasters 
and dramatic events, as is the Sloan-Grey Memorial 
Hospital where Meredith works.
Grey’s Anatomy works because the writers know the 
characters; they understand where they have come 
from and where they are going; they believe in certain 
relationships, and they ?ow seamlessly between 
background characters, guests, recurring characters, and 
the main cast.
Although the primary focus of this season has been on 
Meredith, a few subplots do recur throughout the season, 
and a sense of ?nality looms over all of the characters. 
Shonda Rhimes likes to tie up loose ends and give 
characters a well-deserved ending, so a lot of characters 
are getting their share of the spotlight. This has been 
most notable with Callie and Arizona’s relationship and 
Arizona’s efforts to become a fetal surgeon. This character 
has suffered through an amputated leg, a miscarriage, 
and a very recent separation from Callie; seeing her 
succeed and go through some extreme training was a 
welcomed change in pace and character progression. 
Finally, Shonda Rhimes is closing the show that has given 
her a rise to fame, that spawned a spin-off while it was 
still being broadcast, and inspired two telenovelas in Latin 
America. Grey’s Anatomy will be missed — it has graced 
American television for the past 10 years, and its impact 
will not go unnoticed.

a more singular focus this season than in past 
seasons, allowing the series to round out with an 
examination of how she has grown as a person.

It may not seem like it yet, but it will soon soon be time to 
shed jackets and sweatshirts for T-shirts. With warm rays on 
the way, it may be tempting to throw work out the window 
in lieu of a day playing frisbee on the Cut.
But for those without time to relax, the warm weather is not 
off limits. There is no reason to tackle work inside when there 
are so many outdoor locations on campus to sit back, relax, 
and get down to work.
Following are some of the best places to work with the 
bene?t of fresh breezes. Many of these locations are secluded 
and immune to the noise of campus, making them the 
perfect places to boost productivity.
The Hobbit Hole
Located just outside the main entrance to Baker Hall, this 
study spot on the Mall is not visible to the average passerby. 
A work area carved out of a hill, this space is likened by 
many students to Bilbo Baggins’s house from J.R.R. Tolkien’s 
The Hobbit, and is the perfect spot to hide away in when 
work begins to pile up.
Not only are there a number of spacious benches to spread 
papers out upon, but there are outlets to juice up devices 
when their battery power runs low. Also, the hubbub from 
the Cut seems to fade away after descending into the 
carved out area. Noise from WRCT’s speakers and students 
promoting their organizations’ causes outside Doherty Hall 
are not an issue here. The sun shines pretty brightly on the 
benches, but it’s possible to pick up work and move to the 
shade of a nearby tree when the heat becomes unbearable.
Tepper School Courtyard
Want a space to work outside, but need the comfort of 
mortar and bricks to focus? The courtyard inside the Tepper 
School of Business may be the perfect place. This open area 
at the center of the building is equipped with a number 
of tables and outlets, as well as access to the open sky. At 
night, there are lamps, although turning them on can be 
confusing. There’s always back-up light streaming through 
the windows of the building, though, which makes this 
space a feasible place to work into the early hours of the next 
morning, if needed. Plus the courtyard is closed off to the 
bustle inside the building during the day, so noise is not a 
problem.
If it rains, there is a spacious room right next to the courtyard 
with doors that open out onto it. Prop them open to escape 
the water, but still get that feeling of being outside.
Beneath the Pausch Bridge
The Randy Pausch Bridge is one of the most well-known and 
well-traveled places on campus. At night its rainbow lights 
at make it hard to miss, and the penguins on its walls bring a 
sense of intrigue to the structure.
But what is less well-known about the bridge is the great 
shaded study space it provides below. There is a nice 
patch of grass just below the bridge equipped with a single 
bench. Few travelers pass through this way, so noise is not 
a problem. While there are no outlets to charge devices, the 
area below the bridge offers a nice reading area. Print out 
papers and skim away.
Tennis Courts
On either side of the tennis courts are two perfect places to 
study. Between Margaret Morrison Hall and the courts is an 
area that was just refurbished with chairs to lounge in and 
watch the matches... or do work. This area provides a zen 
atmosphere that could make you feel like you’re in Florida.
On the other side of the courts is a nice grassy hill that 
everyone on campus knows about. The hill is tiered, 
meaning there are various ?at elevation points on it to spread 
out work.
The only downside to these locations is the noise that they 
attract. At the center of campus, these places are almost 
never completely quiet due to the number of people who 
pass by them at all times of the day. Nevertheless, if noise is 
not a hindrance, these locations are some of the most easily 
accessible, and both get strong Wi-Fi signals.
Gesling Stadium Bleachers
The football stadium’s bleachers don’t only have to serve 
spectators on the weekends. They can also serve students 
hoping to get in a few extra hours of studying. The bleachers 
are essentially ?at slabs that span a large portion of the East 
Campus Garage, giving students plenty of real estate to use. 
They can be quiet if not too many people are on the ?eld and 
traf?c isn’t too heavy on Forbes Avenue on the opposite side 
of the garage.
If some cover is preferable, Tartans Pavilion across the 
way offers a view of the stadium and an open atmosphere 
to the outside on days when it is nice. Access to Wi-Fi 
is questionable on the bleachers, but easily attainable at 
Tartans Pavilion.

Inherent Vice
Saturday, Apr. 4
8 p.m., 11 p.m.
One of the biggest crime drama ?icks of 2014, Inherent Vice features an all-star cast. 
Joaquin Phoenix stars as a perpetually high private detective, who is hired by his 
ex to help her current lover escape the nefarious plans of his wife. When there is a 
disappearance — which is really only semi-surprising — Phoenix (known as “Doc”) 
has to pursue various suspects in a world ?lled with surfers and cops, suspects and 
moderately normal people, all fueled and muddled by excessive marijuana. The cast 
includes stellar performances from Reese Witherspoon, Jena Malone, Josh Brolin, and 
Owen Wilson, among others. Filled with laughs and inanity, Inherent Vice is a great 
movie to see with your friends when you can’t decide on any other movie that you 
would like to see. Also, the more people you attend the movie with, the more likely it is 
that somebody will understand it.

Tales from Abroad: Learning to go with the ?ow
Getting the most out of experiences overseas requires a laid-back attitude and an open mind
The beautiful Mont Saint-Michel castle is an ancient 
monastery  on an island in Normandy and offers tour-
ists unparalleled traveling experience.
Before I studied abroad, I hadn’t left the confines 
of North America. Sure, I had been on trips to 
Canada with my family and several high school 
clubs, but that was the extent of my international 
travels. After just under two months studying 
abroad,  I have now been to three new countries. 
I’ve explored several cities in France, where I can 
somewhat easily navigate and communicate with 
locals. But I’ve also been to countries where I 
had to hope that the people I encountered would 
be able to speak English or at least be willing to 
mime their way through a conversation with me.
I tend to be an organized person who makes a 
plan and follows through with it. The idea that I 
would get lost, have to look at a map, have to ask 
questions, and maybe have to take a few detours 
along the way was honestly frightening.
Somehow, though, during my time here, I have 
learned how to relax, let go, and just go with the 
flow. And that is how I have had some of the most 
memorable experiences of my life. I took a day 
trip to a place I had never heard of, with no idea 
what I would do there, and ended up exploring a 
charming town with a rich history and beautiful 
sights. I had a delicious home-cooked dinner after 
going home with a Danish family I met at a brew-
ery tour in Copenhagen. I have had conversations 
with people who come from cities I can barely pro-
nounce in countries that I have only vaguely heard 
about. I have ended up in bars and clubs that I 
will never be able to place on a map where people 
come up to me simply because they want to 
practice their English and hear about the United 
States, and those discussions have been some of 
the most riveting in my life.
I have tried to find museums or stores and ended 
up wandering parks so vast and beautiful they 
made me forget I was in the middle of one of the 
largest cities in the world.
Spontaneity has been my greatest ally during my 
time here. While I may sometimes feel uneasy 
about not having a concrete plan, it’s also incred-
ibly liberating to realize that I can go anywhere 
and do anything that I want. This will probably be 
the only chance I have to live in a foreign country 
and feel like I have no real responsibilities holding 
me down, so I have decided to take this time to be 
young and free.
I have learned how to live in the moment. While 
that sometimes means missing the last metro 
home and having to pay for a taxi, or getting 
caught in the rain without an umbrella, noth-
ing has gone horribly wrong so far. And even if it 
does, that’s just the way life works. No matter how 
hard we plan, we never know exactly how it will 
turn out, so why not welcome every unexpected 
experience, every chance that is presented to 
make a connection and meet some new people? It 
just may change your life.

The internationally renowned Del Sol String Quartet 
graced Carnegie Mellon University with their pres-
ence at their concert in the College of Fine Art’s Kresge 
Auditorium on Thursday night. Though the concert was 
free and open to the public, it was disappointing to see 
that there was only a smattering of audience members, 
maxing out around 50. The musicians — Benjamin 
Kreith and Rick Shinozaki, violin, Charlton Lee, viola, and 
Kathryn Bates, cello — played their hearts out anyway.
Based out of San Francisco, the Del Sol String Quartet 
has been focused on the future of music and its con-
temporary creators since the group was founded back 
in 1992. Known for innovative and fascinating art part-
nerships and their extensive commissioning of modern 
works, Del Sol has brought sounds from around the world 
to many audiences during their tenure. The quartet has 
seven albums, and played a piece off their most recent 
album Sculthorpe: The Complete String Quartets with 
Didgeridoo, at Carnegie Mellon.
The pieces played on Thursday night were all written 
by modern composers. The first piece they played was 
called “Fast Blue Village 2,” and was written in 2007 by 
Uzbekistani composer Elena Kats-Chernin. The piece 
began with an eerie synchronized introduction from the 
cello and the viola. During the course of the piece, two or 
three of the instrumentalists would have phrases played 
in synchronization. This gave the piece the nice ebb and 
flow of coming together and moving apart, giving the 
audience a resolution periodically, and adding structure 
to the shape of the piece. The piece sounded incred-
ibly sad and a little angry as it finished out the last eight 
measures or so with choppy and harsh notes played by all 
four musicians simultaneously. According to the program, 
“Fast Blue Village 2” was created “from material to be 
played by a set of robots designed by Roland Obeiter” and 
indeed, you could tell.
The second piece was introduced by the violist, Charlton 
Lee, who talked about the nature of the piece as “taking 
the old with the new.” The piece — “Calligraffiti” — writ-
ten by Chinese composer Huang Ruo in 2009, mixes the 
traditional word “calligraphy” with “graffiti” and plays off 
that theme during the course of the piece. Lee described 
the piece as being reminiscent of what it was like to 
grow up in a Chinese family in the United States, due to 
Ruo’s mixing of “something so authentic with something 
so profane.” “Calligraffiti” began with a high wavering 
whisper from the cello, before others joined in with a 
whispery tone. Playing with very little pressure and close 
to the bridge on these stringed instruments, the piece of 
music trod the line between ugly and pretty noises. Other 
less traditional tones, liberal use of artificial harmonics, 
and minimal vibrato also gave the piece an exception-
ally unique feel. Occasionally one musician of the bunch 
would play with a clear strong tone, and it felt like a 
breath of fresh air. I began to find myself wishing for more 
of these interludes, as I am a person not familiar with con-
temporary chamber music, and the weird scratchy tone 
often confused me. Ultimately the dichotomy between the 
clear tone and the rest of the tones played by the musi-
cians was part of what the piece was all about, and I was 
intrigued having experienced something so innovative.
The third piece was the piece from their album. Though 
played without the didgeridoo part, String Quartet No. 
14 “Quamby” still called to mind the imagery of the 
Tasmanian shore its composer hailed from. Reminiscing 
on life as a child, Peter Sculthorpe wrote the piece about 
cliffs he used to walk on as a child, and the experience of 
watching the birds and thinking about the cliffs’ history. 
The word “Quamby,” the name of a certain bluff, means 
“save me” or “mercy.” The piece is in four movements, 
though all were connected by a general feeling of loneli-
ness and wonder. The first movement’s long and dramatic 
phrasing sounded kind of like the beautiful sweeping mel-
odies of the Pride and Prejudice film from 2005, though 
played in a completely minor key. The third movement 
featured some gull sounds mimicked perfectly on the 
cello. All in all this piece was my favorite of the evening, 
managing to convey a whole story in just four short move-
ments.
The second half of the concert began with Italian com-
poser Stefano Scodannibio’s take on Monteverdi’s famous 
madrigals. “Mas Lugares (su Madrigali di Monteverdi)” 
did indeed use melodies and harmonies found in the 
madrigals, but explored these well known songs using 
new texture and strange harmonic couplings. During his 
introduction of the piece, violinist Benjamin Kreith talked 
about how “tactile” a composer Scodannibio was, and 
that became aggressively apparent during the course of 
the piece. Maybe because I’m kind of a wimp, I found 
myself wishing that the pieces were played with tradi-
tional tone and emphasis, as I am not used to hearing 
such husky and squeaky sounds. Though I can appreciate 
the creative and textured piece, it definitely is not one 
that is going on my listening list.
The concert ended with a piece written by a member of 
Carnegie Mellon School of Music faculty, Professor Reza 
Vali, who hails from Iran. His piece “Gâtâr (Calligraphy 
No. 11)” used the Persian modal system, instead of a 
Western modal system. This made the intervals in the 
piece sound very different from the intervals audiences 
are accustomed to hearing in, say, Mozart. It was the 
Pittsburgh premiere of this piece and the third piece of 
Valli’s the quartet has played. The piece included fre-
quent solos from the instrumentalists, and often seemed 
to include portions of call and response. The response to 
the piece was enthusiastic and Professor Vali joined the 
musicians on stage for a final bow.
It was wonderful to attend a performance from individu-
als who are on the forefront of contemporary chamber 
music, and it only made me wish that more people had 
gone to see the performance. The innovative use of tone 
quality, harmony, and articulate storytelling provoked me 
to consider what I think of as beautiful chamber music, 
and where I think chamber music is going. For a genre 
so rooted in the music of its historical greats, I think it is 
important to put down the Beethoven once in a while and 
look to the future.

Jeanne Theoharis gave a riveting lecture focused on 
breaking misconceptions about the legendary Civil 
Rights activist, Rosa Parks, to a captivated audience this 
past Wednesday.
A professor at Brooklyn College and author of the 
critically acclaimed book, The Rebellious Life of Mrs. 
Rosa Parks, Theoharis delved into Parks’ background 
as a civil rights activist at Giant Eagle Auditorium on 
March 25. Among her key points was how Parks’ famous 
bus protest was not mere coincidence, but stemmed 
from her years of ?ghting against racial injustice.
Theoharis’ dynamic and impassioned lecture painted 
Parks in a way that broke the image of her as just a tired, 
middle-aged woman who refused to get out of her seat. 
Parks was described as “feisty,” and as continuously 
asking others, “Why do you push us around?”
This rebellious spirit was evidenced by Parks’ history 
in the Civil Rights Movement. As a child, she would sit 
by her shotgun-wielding grandfather in the south who 
protected their home against racial violence. As an adult, 
Parks became interested in the movement, and a turning 
point came when she met fellow activist and future 
husband Raymond Parks in 1931, who was a lawyer in 
the infamous Scottsboro case.
Throughout the 1940s, Parks took a more prominent 
role in the ?ght against racial injustice. She joined her 
local NAACP chapter, becoming its Grand Secretary, 
and worked with other prominent Civil Rights leaders 
such as E.D. Nixon in ?ghting for voter registration 
and eliminating poll taxes. After years of her own 
struggle, Parks voted for the ?rst time in 1945. Parks 
then continued to work with criminal justice issues, 
particularly by ?nding legal defense for cases where 
black men were being wrongfully accused of crimes and 
cases where the law was unresponsive to white brutality.
However, Parks’ history is not without its hardship, a 
feature overlooked by many. Due to her activism, she 
was often banned from working and faced immense 
economic problems. By the late 1940s, Parks had begun 
to burn out. In fact, early in 1955 (the same year as her 
famous bus protest), Parks stated that she believed the 
movement was out of her hands, but was the future 
of new generations. Yet, her perseverance and her 
attendance at the Highlander School that summer would 
rekindle her passion.
As Theoharis stated, it is this perseverance and also 
Parks’ knowledge of the movement that make her a true 
hero. Despite her hardships and her knowledge of the 
racial violence often taken against black activists, Parks 
continued to ?ght for civil rights. However, the reiterated 
fable that we are all familiar with loses these details and 
this agency — Parks’ action on the bus, though still 
heroic, reduces her to being a hero by chance, not a hero 
through her own virtues.
In fact, Theoharis dispelled several myths of the bus 
story during her lecture. First, Parks was not the ?rst 
African American that refused to give up their seat on 
a bus. Others, including Parks, had done so and had 
been arrested in the past. Next, when Parks was asked 
to move from her seat, she did not merely state that she 
was tired after her job as a tailor. She understood the 
consequences of her actions, and takes this injustice 
as an opportunity to not consent to this treatment. 
Theoharis stated that it was only after the insistence of 
the bus driver that the police actually arrested her, and 
she was later released from jail that night, shaken but 
unharmed.
So why is Parks remembered as such a heroic and 
in?uential ?gure, if others had already conducted several 
similar protests?
One large factor of Parks’ legacy is her collaboration with 
E.D. Nixon. Nixon, a prominent white lawyer, saw Parks 
as a valuable test case. Parks had an “ideal image”: she 
was “working class in economics” and “middle class in 
demeanor”, making her relatable to other blacks. Most 
importantly, Nixon knew Parks’ spirit was unbreakable.
Theoharis continued that although Parks’ legacy is often 
left with her at the bus, she actually continued for the 
remainder of her life. Parks helped organize the highly 
intricate and methodically planned carpool system 
which made the Montgomery boycott of the bus system 
possible. This boycott, and other protests organized 
by Parks, would help propel civil rights leaders such as 
Martin Luther King Jr. into the national movement.
Following her move to Detroit, Parks continued to face 
economic hardships, but persevered, ?ghting for housing 
issues, freedom for political prisoners, and accessible 
education.
Theoharis’ lecture gave new insight on a legendary icon 
and true American hero. However, Parks’ life shows 
that with enough courage, perseverance, and faith, any 
individual can dramatically change the socioeconomic 
and political culture of our nation.
Most importantly, though, Theoharis’ talk opened  up a 
much needed dialogue in the humanities departments 
here at Carnegie Mellon, a dialogue about the ways in 
which historical narratives learned in high school affect 
the way students learn about history in college. For a 
school whose humanities are often overshadowed by 
other departments, talking about the rami?cations of the 
way history is told is important in boosting the school’s 
awareness of the direction of the humanities, and keeps 
Dietrich on the cutting edge of such education.
