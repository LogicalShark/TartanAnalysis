“Lift every voice and 
sing, ‘til earth and heaven 
ring, ring with the harmo-
nies of Liberty,” chimed the 
audience, led by senior dra-
ma major Tsilala Graham-
Haynes in Rangos Hall in 
the University Center last 
Monday afternoon.
The song, “Lift Every 
Voice and Sing,” considered 
by many to be the national 
anthem of African-Ameri-
cans, was used to kick off 
the keynote address by dis-
tinguished service professor 
of social and decision sci-
ence and public policy and 
management Dr. Jendayi E. 
Frazer that concluded the 
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
program.
Carnegie Mellon cel-
ebrated Martin Luther King, 
Jr.’s birthday with classes 
in the morning and perfor-
mances and speeches about 
diversity and remembering 
King in the afternoon.
The address featured 
two student speakers. Se-
nior electrical and comput-
er engineering major Vijay 
Jayaram delineated King 
as “a man who catalyzed a 
movement,” “a doer,” and 
a “drum major for change.” 
Jayaram also focused on

CHRIS GALVIN
Staffwriter
In the January 2014 issue 
of Dining Dish, Housing and 
Dining Services announced 
two important changes to 
the healthy food options on 
campus: extended hours at 
Evgefstos and new healthy 
menu options available at The 
Underground.
Evgefstos features vegan 
and vegetarian options not 
available elsewhere on cam-
pus. The eatery, however, was 
not open for dinner during the 
fall semester, and was only 
open until 4 p.m. Monday 
through Friday.
During Dining Services 
Advisory Council (DSAC) 
meetings, members of Un-
dergraduate Student Senate 
brought attention to the pop-
ularity of Evgefstos and the 
demand for extended hours. 
Dining Services responded to 
the feedback by extending the 
location’s hours until 8 p.m. 
Monday through Friday.
“Meeting the needs of our 
vegetarian populations is an 
ongoing priority area in cam-
pus dining since [Evgefstos] 
opened in 2006” wrote Paula 
Martin, University Health Ser-
vices’s registered dietitian, in 
an email.
Students have respond-
ed positively to the change 
and seem to appreciate the 
increase in healthy dinner 
options.
“I am neither vegan or 
vegetarian, but I think it’s a 
healthy option, and I am in-
terested in eating healthy,” 
said Ade Odutayo, a master’s 
student in the Tepper School 
of Business.
“I think [the new hours] 
are better, [and provide] more 
options,” said senior mechani-
cal engineering major Krys-
tina Calfo. “I usually go to 
Resnik, but now I can come 
here instead.”
Dining Services is continu-
ing to try to expand healthy 
and vegetarian options on 
campus by working with ven-
dor partners to offer more 
vegetarian and vegan dishes 
at various dining locations.
“The past three years have 
included the addition of sev-
eral new dining locations and 
seriously improved menus,” 
wrote student body vice presi-
dent and junior electrical and 
computer engineering ma-
jor Ian Glasner, in an email. 
“The food on campus is much 
healthier than it ever has 
been.”
The change in The Under-
ground menu was also in-
spired by student opinions at 
DSAC meetings.
“Based on student feed-
back, Dining Services col-
laborated with our vending 
partner at The Underground 
to offer more healthy choices 
for students, besides the very 
popular traditional late night 
fare,” wrote Pascal Petter, di-
rector of Dining Services, in 
an email. “Although students

The 2014 Winter Olympics, 
which begin on Friday, Feb. 7, 
will take place in Sochi, Rus-
sia. Russia has made waves 
internationally with its harsh 
anti-gay policies and laws; 
recently, Russia’s lower house 
of parliament overwhelmingly 
approved a law banning the 
distribution of information 
about homosexuality to chil-
dren, according to an article 
from CBS news online.
Although President of Rus-
sia Vladimir Putin has prom-
ised that the Winter Olympics 
in Sochi will be discrimina-
tion-free in response to back-
lash about the law, many 
Americans are worried about 
gay rights in Russia and gay 
American Olympic athletes.
A host of companies spon-
sors the Olympic Games, in-
cluding Coca-Cola, McDon-
alds, General Electric, Proctor 
and Gamble, and Visa.
John Moriarty, a sopho-
more directing major, along 
with Jeff Kasinoff, a junior 
at Wesleyan University, 
co-founded Anything But 
Coke, a campaign to boy-
cott Coca-Cola products to 
convince Coca-Cola to pull 
its sponsorship of the Sochi 
Olympics.
“Anything But Coke is an 
online campaign that I start-
ed because of the atrocities 
happening to gay citizens in 
Russia,” Moriarty said. “Hate 
groups across the country 
have spiraled out of control. 
For example, a group called 
Occupy Pedophilia has been 
kidnapping activists and gay 
teens and torturing them and 
putting videos of the torture 
online, and the government 
hasn’t been doing anything 
about it. Some of the lead-
ers have spoken and said that 
[Occupy Pedophilia] is doing a 
service for the nation; they’re 
basically pouring lighter ?uid 
over the situation.”
Moriarty hopes to send a 
message to Coca-Cola, and 
other Olympics sponsors, by 
drinking anything but Coca-
Cola and pouring out the 
company’s products in public 
protests.
Last Sunday, Moriarty and 
about twenty others poured 
out Coca-Cola products — 
none of which they bought 
— at the intersection of More-
wood and Forbes Avenues. 
Similar protests are slated in 
the coming weeks at other 
universities and high schools 
across the country. The next 
protest takes place next week 
at Wesleyan University. After 
that, protests will take place at 
schools such as Boston Univer-
sity and St. Michael’s College 
in Colchester, Vt.
Garrett Eucker, a sopho-
more vocal performance ma-
jor, thinks that the campaign 
is trying to send an important 
message, but might be doing it 
in the wrong way. “I think it’s 
misleading, saying that people 
should be blaming Coca-Cola 
strictly because Coca-Cola is 
not supporting [LGBT rights] 
when it’s really Russia violat-
ing civil rights and Coca-Cola 
is supporting the Olympics, 
not Russia,” Eucker said. Eu-
cker does agree that if Coca-
Cola pulled their sponsorship 
from the Olympics, it would 
send an important message to 
Russia.
“Coca-Cola is not the vil-
lain. But they do have the 
power to make real change,” 
Moriarty wrote in an email to 
The Tartan. “This issue is com-
plicated but it doesn’t mean 
it’s not black and white. We 
cannot support corporations 
who put pro?t before human 
rights. No matter who is suf-
fering.”

Last year, about 100 Carn-
egie Mellon faculty sat down 
to decide what Carnegie 
Mellon does best. The list 
was narrowed down to eight 
discreet categories that have 
become the eight concentra-
tions available in the Integra-
tive Design, Arts, and Tech-
nology Network (IDeATe) 
program.
In this program, students 
from any academic back-
ground can choose from one 
of eight interdisciplinary 
concentrations, which in-
clude: animation and special 
effects, entrepreneurship 
for creative industries, game 
design, intelligent environ-
ment, learning media, media 
design, physical computing, 
and sound design.
The IDeATe program is 
headed by Thanassis Rikakis, 
vice provost for design, arts, 
and technology, and project 
manager Kelly Delaney. “If 
you decide that one of these 
areas is of interest to you, you 
go to your advisor and you 
say, ‘hey, you know I think I 
might be interested in doing 
some interdisciplinary kind 
of work,’ ” said Rikakis. “Then 
during your sophomore year 
you have to pass a portal 
course, and once you pass 
the portal course you have to 
take two courses within the 
list of concentrations.”
The list of concentrations 
came from a think tank of 
Carnegie Mellon’s faculty,” 
Rikakis said. “We had a 
one-year process for this, so 
we brought together some 
working teams from across 
all the colleges — about a 
hundred people — and they 
came up with the eight ar-
eas of strength that we have 
at CMU, and a list of courses. 
We have very good represen-
tation from all the colleges; 
that was the consensus out-
come.”
Rikakis wanted the con-
centrations to have a low 
barrier of entry, so the portal 
courses, which are prereq-
uisites to the concentration 
courses, are open to students 
of any major. Portal courses 
include collaborative, inter-
disciplinary courses, such as 
Introduction to Computing 
for Creative Practitioners and 
Introduction to Media Syn-
thesis and Analysis.
The portal courses are 
designed to help ease stu-
dents from disciplinary back-
grounds into interdisciplin-
ary work. Introduction to 
Media and Synthesis Analy-
sis, for example, is described 
on the IDeATe website as 
“an introduction to basic 
principles for the creation of 
digitally mediated content, 
aimed towards students from 
science and engineering dis-
ciplines who have limited 
exposure to content analysis 
and authoring.” The course 
will have three modules: the 
narrative module, the visual 
synthesis module, and the 
sound synthesis module. All 
students in the course will 
complete an additional mod-
ule — the critical analysis 
module — and then choose 
two of the three remaining 
modules.
By the end of the course, 
according to the IDeATe web-
site, students will be able to

Recently, Carnegie Mellon 
researchers in the depart-
ment of psychology used a 
sensory integration model to 
better understand how the 
brain contextualizes what 
it sees and senses, a process 
called priming. Scientists 
have been frustrated by prim-
ing for years as they try to un-
derstand how it functions.
Professor of psychology 
Roberta Klatzky, and assis-
tant professor of psychology 
J. David Creswell published 
a study in Perspectives on 
Psychological Science using 
a well-established human 
perception theory to explain 
how and why priming works, 
and why it can be such an un-
predictable process. Klatzky 
and Creswell adapted an ex-
isting model of inter-sensory 
perception to describe how 
the multiple senses contrib-
ute to the brain’s overarch-
ing impression of the world 
around it.
“We began to think about 
social priming as just another 
way that our senses interact,” 
said Klatzky in a university 
press release.
“Our approach is to under-
stand how the basic processes 
work, in order to account for 
the inconsistencies,” Klatzky 
said in the press release. 
“Because, as scientists, 
once you understand the 
underlying causes, you are 
gifted with control over when 
effects occur and when they 
don’t,” she continued.
Klatzky and Cresswell’s 
model posits that each sense 
gathers information through 
a separate channel. 
This information is then 
collated in the brain, and the 
results of each sense are com-
bined to give the perceptual 
truth. 
When someone stirs a mug 
of coffee with a metal spoon, 
for example, and hears the 
spoon clank on the cup, they 
can deduce that the mug is 
made of a hard material.
CMU researchers begin to understand the nature of unconscious priming
CMU and Georgetown researchers ?nd new results about mandatory disclosure
Advisers — like doctors, 
lawyers, and accountants 
— face con?icts of interest 
(COIs) when they have a 
personal stake in the matter 
on which they are advising. 
Typically, COI disclosure is 
mandatory in order to pro-
tect consumers from biased 
advice. Past studies have 
shown, however, that even 
mandatory disclosure does 
not protect consumers from 
biased advice.
New research from Carne-
gie Mellon Herbert A. Simon 
Professor of Economics and 
Psychology George Loewen-
stein and Georgetown Uni-
versity assistant professor of 
business ethics Sunita Sah 
looks at situations in which 
advisers can choose whether 
or not they have COIs, such 
as doctors who are offered 
gifts from pharmaceutical 
companies. Loewenstein and 
Shah’s work, published in 
Psychological Science, found 
that, although the results of 
previous studies hold, when 
advisers have a choice about 
COIs, mandatory disclosure 
convinces them to choose 
against the COI so that they 
have nothing to disclose.
“Prior research has cast 
doubt as to the effectiveness 
of disclosure for managing 
con?icts of interest, particu-
larly when consumers have 
the burden of interpreting 
and reacting to the informa-
tion,” said Shah, lead author 
of the study, in a university 
press release. “Our ?ndings 
suggest that disclosure can 
become a successful inter-
vention to managing some 
con?icts of interest if it 
motivates professionals or 
providers to avoid such con-
?icts.”
“Disclosure doesn’t seem 
to be much good when con-
?icts are unavoidable, but it 
does seem to help when ad-
visers have a choice about 
whether to subject them-
selves to con?icts,” said 
Loewenstein in the press re-
lease. “A nice feature of dis-
closure is that it is, in effect, 
‘self-calibrating.’ Doctors, 
for example, are unlikely 
to ?nd it worth it to accept 
small gifts such as pens or 
calendars if the gifts are go-
ing to be disclosed. Although 
larger gifts would be more 
tempting, doctors are likely 
to be deterred from accept-
ing them because disclosure 
of large gifts would be more 
damaging to their reputa-
tions.”

particularly the concept of 
moral education. He cited 
Martin Luther King, Jr.’s fa-
mous quote ?rst published in 
the Morehouse College Stu-
dent Newspaper, The Maroon 
Tiger, in 1947: “The function 
of education is to teach one to 
think intensively and to think 
critically. Intelligence plus 
character — that is the true 
goal of education.”
Jayarum emphasized the 
importance of education to 
“understand the human con-
dition before we are able to 
break boundaries.”
Following Jayarum, junior 
civil engineering major Mil-
lard McElwee spoke of his 
personal experience of being 
a “part of King’s dream.” Al-
though he said that his experi-
ences at Carnegie Mellon have 
shown that “true innovation 
comes from a variety of per-
spectives,” he also spoke of 
the need for there to be “more 
progress until [his own] nar-
rative is the norm.” McElwee 
said that the best way to re-
member King is to persistently 
put the ?ght for equality at the 
top of our agendas.
The two student speakers 
set the tone for Frazer’s key-
note, “Leading with Courage 
and Conviction.” In addition 
to her appointments in the 
Heinz College’s School of Pub-
lic Policy and the department 
of social and decision scienc-
es, Frazer is also the Director 
of Carnegie Mellon’s Center 
for International Policy and 
Innovation. She was sworn 
in as the ?rst female U.S. am-
bassador to South Africa in 
2004 and is widely credited 
for designing the Bush admin-
istration’s policies for ending 
the wars in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Sierra 
Leone, Liberia, and Burundi. 
Frazer was also instrumental 
in establishing many of the 
Bush administration’s initia-
tives in Africa.
Frazer’s speech called for 
a transformation of leader-
ship, to return to a “purpose 
greater than self.” She de?ned 
courage as the “willingness 
to persevere, deriving from 
moral strength.” Frazer spoke 
of the process of turning faith 
into conviction into leader-
ship. She drew examples from 
the lives of King, Nelson Man-
dela, and Mahatma Gandhi 
as leaders who led with cour-
age and conviction, but also 
a willingness to compromise 
and change tactics when nec-
essary.
Frazer discussed how we 
as citizens have moved away 
from the true actions against 
injustice, now settling for sim-
ply clicking the Change.org 
button instead of mobilizing a 
movement as King did. She re-
ferred to Harriet Tubman, who 
led slaves out of the South, as 
her personal inspiration, an 
epitome of action and leading 
with courage and conviction.
Student responses to the 
keynote address were over-
whelmingly positive; most 
students found Frazer to be 
both intriguing and inspiring.
“I really like how she ap-
plied Dr. King’s values and be-
liefs to today’s society, and liv-
ing life with a purpose and a 
vision,” said sophomore mate-
rials science and engineering 
and biomedical engineering 
double major Shreya Munjal.
“[Frazer] challenged [us] 
to look at the world from a 
different perspective,” said 
junior chemistry major Kevin 
Hunter. 
“She urged us to strive to-
ward a better future for our-
selves and those around us 
while holding true to our own 
ideals.”
Student speeches call for leadership
From CELEBRATION, A1
Lower calorie options offered on campus
can still order a cheeseburger 
or chicken ?ngers, they now 
have healthier alternatives to 
select from.”
The new menu items in-
clude more gluten-free op-
tions and egg beaters avail-
able for breakfast, as well as 
seven sandwiches, two salads, 
and one specialty item — 
blackened salmon ?let. The 
Underground has also started 
to use whole-grain bread for 
the majority of sandwiches. 
In addition to these changes, 
The Underground has imple-
mented a three-week rotating 
menu cycle that offers meal 
options under 500 calories.
“This cycle menu was 
launched as we learned from 
students that a similar menu 
offered at the Exchange, our 
highest volume dining loca-
tion, was extremely popular,” 
wrote Petter in the email. “We 
shared this with our vendor 
partner at The Underground 
and the concept was emulated 
with positive results thus far.”
“Under 500 calories is 
healthy by the Underground’s 
standards,” Calfo said.
Other changes to improve 
healthy food options include 
fresh produce in Entropy+, a 
new noodle bowl concept for 
the Marketplace in the Univer-
sity Center, and grilled salmon 
available at The Exchange.
“We have to balance be-
tween offering our students 
variety and balance while also 
catering to taste preference,” 
wrote Martin. “The key here is 
‘we offer’ and it is up to each 
individual student to ‘decide’ 
which menu items to choose 
and this is where the nutrition 
education and health pro-
motion piece comes into the 
equation.”
University Health Services 
also contributes to improving 
students’ diets on campus by 
providing services to promote 
healthy eating and lifestyles.
“We offer peer education 
programs, individual nutri-
tion counseling and education 
sessions, screening for disor-
dered eating, and established 
the dinning icon program 
to assist vendors with menu 
planning that includes health-
focused dining offerings” said 
Martin.
Housing and Dining Ser-
vices has even more changes 
planned for the remainder of 
the semester, including premi-
um dinners and theme nights 
in Schatz Dining Room, bento 
box lunches available from 
Worlds of Flavor, culinary 
showcase events, farmers’ 
markets, additional gluten-
free items, and Halal options.
“I think we could do more 
for people with food aller-
gies,” wrote Glasner in the 
email. “However, this is a dif?-
cult problem to solve because 
allergies vary greatly from 
person to person.”
For the upcoming fall se-
mester, students can expect a 
nutrition app that will allow 
students to check nutritional 
values on any menu item from 
their mobile device, as well 
as more dining locations with 
revised hours of operation to 
re?ect student demand.
“As the demand for healthy 
food continues to grow on 
campus, I have no doubt that 
CMU administration will con-
tinue to provide the quality of 
food students prefer,” wrote 
Glasner. “I am working closely 
with Pascal Petter, the direc-
tor of dining services, to make 
sure students have access to 
healthy food if they want it.”
“We will continue to col-
laborate with students and 
campus departments to evolve 
the program based on cam-
pus needs and trends within 
the campus dining industry,” 
wrote Petter in the email. “As 
a matter of fact, I am currently 
developing a dining master 
plan and would welcome any 
suggestions or ideas that can 
help me make better informed 
decisions.” Students can con-
tact Petter by going to his of-

‘Anything But Coke’ protests on Forbes
American companies to 
sponsor the 2014 Winter 
Olympics; according to the 
FAQ on Coca-Cola’s website, 
the company is the longest 
continuous sponsor of the 
Olympics.
“We are a business and 
our role as of?cial soft drinks 
provider enables us to show-
case the range of drinks we 
offer and sell these at the 
Olympics and Paralympic 
games,” the FAQ continues. 
“We recognize that attitudes 
to sponsorship have changed 
and we want to understand 
more about the social value 
our sponsorship brings. This 
is why we have been work-
ing with independent think 
tank demos to create a new 
model of sponsorship evalua-
tion that looks to quantify the 
social impact of sponsorship 
activity.”
Moriarty draws parallels 
between his and Kasinoff’s 
campaign and anti-Coca-Cola 
protests in the 1990s. 
“This is not a campaign 
that hasn’t had a history of 
success in terms of boycotting 
Coca-Cola speci?cally,” Mori-
arty said. “In 1990 there was 
a series of protests at univer-
sities across the country that 
led to Coca-Cola disinveste-
ing in South Africa, and be-
cause they are a corporation 
that has so much in?uence 
politically and culturally, it 
pressured South Africa to re-
think their politics concern-
ing race.”
Moriarty also noted that 
the United States as a nation 
has boycotted the Olympic 
Games before. “We boycotted 
the Olympics as a nation in 
Moscow in the 1980s due to 
their civil rights violations. By 
not doing it now we are say-
ing that these violations don’t 
justify it.”
Although the U.S. is send-
ing gay athletes to the Olym-
pics, Moriarty says that this 
isn’t enough. “In 1936, Coca-
Cola sponsored the Olympics 
in Berlin, Germany, at a time 
when they were making their 
?rst anti-semitic laws saying 
that only Aryans could com-
pete. We sent Jewish athletes 
in — some even won the gold 
— but they didn’t respond to 
the symbol because it isn’t 
enough. We need to give dic-
tators ?nancial incentive to 
pull out, just as we are giving 
Coca-Cola ?nancial incentive 
to pull out.”
Moriarty, along with Ka-
sinoff and the president of 
ALLIES, Carnegie Mellon’s 
LGBT support club, are meet-
ing with a representative 
from Coca-Cola next week. 
“We have low expectations 
for the meeting, but hopefully 
from that meeting we can 
meet with someone higher up 
to see what they can do,” Mo-
riarty said. “It’s a great sign 
because it means that they’re 
listening, and they’re hearing 
our voice, and we have made 
some in?uence — just 20 peo-
ple pouring out coke.”

On Jan. 10, Carnegie Mel-
lon Emergency Medical Ser-
vices (CMU EMS), after ten 
years of tossing the idea back 
and forth, was able to obtain 
their very own CMU EMS car. 
Former logistics director and 
current supervisor Evan Fin-
kelstein said that the car al-
lows them to transport equip-
ment to any point on campus, 
making arriving at a call much 
more ef?cient.
Current logistics director 
and supervisor Blaise Lough-
man said, “The idea’s been 
around for ten years, but it 
started to make headway 
last year.”
Former operations direc-
tor and alumnus Tim Bach 
and Finklestein were the main 
proponents of acquiring the 
car. They wrote an in-depth 
proposal to University Health 
Services (UHS) in which they 
compared the time that they 
could arrive at a scene of an 
emergency with and without 
a car. Additionally, they com-
pared themselves to peer insti-
tutions such as Duke Univer-
sity and Columbia University, 
which both have cars and am-
bulances as part of their EMS 
programs.

ing UHS that a CMU EMS 
car would be a bene?cial

CMU EMS student staff calls experiences ‘rewarding’
“demonstrate the ability to 
think critically across several 
theoretical paradigms” and 
“articulate the relationship be-
tween Art/Design practice and 
theory.”
Computing for Creative 
Practitioners, on the other 
hand, is housed in the depart-
ment of computer science and 
is meant for visual and liberal 
arts students looking to do 
more interdisciplinary work. 
The IDeATe website describes 
the course as “an introduction 
to fundamental computing 
principles and programming 
techniques for creative cul-
tural practices, with special 
consideration to applications 
in music, design, and the vi-
sual arts.”
“You can do these from any 
major,” Rikakis said. “The por-
tal courses are set up so that 
you can ?nd the best concen-
tration from the outside, and 
all the courses within the con-
centration are set up to be col-
laborative courses, so the in-
structors are expecting people 
from different backgrounds to 
work on things together.”
If a student working toward 
a concentration is particularly 
engaged in the program, he or 
she can take two more courses 
— in addition to the four re-
quired for the concentration 
— to make it a minor.
Rikakis stipulated that 
the main difference between 
choosing a concentration and 
a minor centers around double 
counting restrictions.
“If you’re doing a minor 
you can’t do that — you’d have 
to do some courses that don’t 
count toward your major,” 
Rikakis said. “We’re trying to 
keep the bar very low, so you 
can start it as a concentration 
and if you like it, you can make 
it your minor.”
The IDeATe courses were 
developed by existing Carn-
egie Mellon faculty, many who 
will go on to teach the courses 
they develop. Because many 
faculty are busy within their 
disciplines, however, Carnegie 
Mellon will also be taking on 
new faculty in the fall to teach 
the new courses.
“All of the courses are being 
developed by faculty from the 
working groups, but because 
many of the [faculty] are very 
busy teaching disciplinary 
courses and stuff like that, 
we are also hiring some new 
faculty,” Rikakis said. “We’re 
bringing in a number of new 
faculty to teach in this space 
along with existing faculty, 
but they’re all being developed 
by expert faculty we already 
have here.”
The IDeATe program will 
also be accompanied by the 
repurposing of a Carnegie 
Mellon building on the cor-
ner of South Craig Street and 
Forbes Avenue. According to 
Rikakis, the new collabora-
tive, interdisciplinary building 
will be open 24 hours a day 
to anyone participating in the 
IDeATe program. The building 
will have a variety of spaces 
for everything from physical 
prototyping to media editing.
IDeATe project manager 
Kelly Delaney urges students 
who are interested in par-
ticipating in IDeATe to con-
tact their advisors and talk 
about registering for the por-
tal courses this coming Fall 
semester.

investment, Bach and Finkel-
stein were able to make their 
plans a reality. Though techni-
cally owned by UHS, the car 
is authorized to be driven by 
only CMU EMS crew chiefs, 
who have to be speci?cally li-
censed to drive such vehicles. 
The CMU EMS Ford car is 
equipped with backboards, 
medical equipment, and au-
dio devices that connect to 
the University of Pittsburgh 
Medical Center (UPMC), the 
Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, 
University Police, and CMU 
EMS’s home base in Doherty 
Apartments.
The next step for CMU 
EMS, according to Loughman, 
is to acquire a golf cart to more 
ef?ciently transport equip-
ment within the campus.
CMU EMS is one of the 
most recognizable organiza-
tions on campus, with their 
24/7 on-call staf?ng and di-
rect support of Pittsburgh 
Emergency Medical Services 
and University Police. With 
its 25 current members, CMU 
EMS is required to be on watch 
24/7, meaning that most 
members must work multiple 
shifts each week. The mem-
bers comprise a wide variety 
of people, such as senior com-
puter science major, executive 
director, and medical member 
Jeff Cooper, who will work at 
Google when he graduates 
in the spring. When asked 
why he became part of CMU 
EMS, he said that he “found a 
group of people that were also 
passionate about something 
big, like saving lives. It’s high 
stress, but it’s so rewarding.”
In 2011, CMU EMS saved a 
faculty member from cardiac 
arrest.
“When we see the faculty 
member, and she sees us in 
our uniform, she feels very 
thankful to us. It’s a great feel-
ing,” Cooper said.
The achievements of CMU 
EMS have received acclaim 
from various medical institu-
tions in the area that vouched 
for CMU EMS’s response time 
— in many cases, if CMU EMS 
did not arrive as quickly as 
they did, the injured person 
may have died. Many of the 
events that CMU EMS respond 
to daily are generally not high 
emergency, but include inju-
ries, intoxication, faintness, 
and allergy responses.
CMU EMS typically re-
ceives many more calls during 
the weekend. During Spring 
Carnival, CMU EMS doubles 
and sometimes even triples 
the staff that is available on-
call, with different groups des-
ignated on midway, campus, 
and other areas relative to 
campus where CMU students 
may hang out during Carnival.
Recently, CMU EMS has ex-
perienced funding shortages. 
Loughman responded to 
a case in which he needed an 
EpiPen. 
He used the $60 pen to 
treat life-threatening allergic 
reactions, paid for by himself. 
Nonetheless, according to 
Loughman, adequate funding 
for CMU EMS is never a prob-
lem when lives can be saved 
and when people stay hungry 
to serve their campus in the 
biggest way they can.

Medicine and medical tech-
nology have long been areas 
of public interest due to their 
clear societal bene?ts. Recent 
technological advancements 
have encouraged medical 
advancements, particularly 
in the ?elds of orthotics and 
prosthetics. Studies by Carn-
egie Mellon researcher Yong-
Lae Park suggest that soft, 
bio-inspired orthotic devices 
could aid in the rehabilitation 
of foot and ankle disorders.
Park, currently an assistant 
professor in the Robotics Insti-
tute and the School of Com-
puter Science at Carnegie Mel-
lon, conducted the research 
while a postdoctoral research-
er at Harvard’s Wyss Institute 
for Biologically Inspired En-
gineering with chief technol-
ogy of?cer at BioSensics LLC, 
Bor-rong Chen and assistant 
professor at the University of 
Southern California Viterbi 
School of Engineering, Nés-
tor O. Pérez-Arancibia. The 
team looked at the advantages 
of using a soft orthotic device 
based on the anatomy of the 
lower leg for rehabilitation of 
foot and ankle disorders.
Park explained that the 
idea for the device arose from 
the realization that the de-
vice needed to be different 
from traditional exoskeletons, 
which are rigid structures 
used for rehabilitation. 
“The advantage of a tra-
ditional exoskeleton is that 
all the joints are really well 
de?ned and you can transmit 
forces more accurately,” Park 
said. “But the limitations are 
that it is bulky and it de?nes 
your motions. You cannot de-
?ne your motion by yourself.”
Exoskeleton devices gen-
erally limit motion to one-di-
mension despite the fact that 
natural ankles are capable 
of three-dimensional motion. 
The soft, bio-inspired device 
that Park and his fellow re-
searchers developed mimics 
the four main muscles in the 
lower leg that contribute to 
the movement of the ankle. 
By modeling the device after 
the anatomy of the lower leg 
and utilizing a soft design, the 
team produced a device that 
allows for more natural mo-
tion. 
“It is impossible to copy all 
the muscles,” Park admitted. 
“As an engineer, we can sim-
plify the identi?cation. We can 
make the device compact and 
simple but still give active as-
sistance.”
The development of a soft, 
bio-inspired orthotic has the 
potential to spark huge devel-
opments in the future. Park 
explained that while there 
have recently been many stag-
gering developments in the 
?eld of prosthetics, very little 
has changed in the ?eld of 
orthotics. Braces are gener-
ally the same and tend to keep 
joints in ?xed angles or posi-
tions. “By doing this research, 
I think we can get more atten-
tion from society and more in-
terest in this area, which will 
give us more leverage to sup-
port the advancement of the 
?eld,” Park said.
Park also sees this research 
having an in?uence on the in-
tegration of robotics into ev-
ery day human life. 
“Today we use robots to 
help people, but they are not 
really an interactive part of 
our world. In the future I see 
robots as part of our daily 
life,” Park said. “In that sense, 
soft robots will have a large 
impact. This technology al-
lows us to make robots soft so 
they can be closer to the hu-
man body and to human life.”
Despite the promising re-
sults of the research, how-
ever, there is still a long way 
to go. Park explained that the 
soft design, as opposed to the 
more traditional exoskeleton 
design, poses some problems. 
For example, it is much harder 
to de?ne and transmit force in 
the soft design because, com-
pared to traditional braces, 
the device is much more de-
pendent on the user. 
Since the force must travel 
through the skin and muscle 
to reach the bone, force trans-
mission and control are also 
more dif?cult. “This is very 
early staging of the prototype 
and design,” Park said. “The 
device itself cannot be practi-
cal immediately.”
An unconventional ap-
proach to orthotics, using 
soft robotics for rehabilitation 
purposes has the potential to 
greatly impact many ?elds of 
study. This research not only 
paves the way for new ad-
vances in medical treatment, 
but may also shed light on the 
steps that need to be taken in 
order to more effectively in-
tegrate robots into our daily 
lives.

Old rover ?nds new evidence of water on Mars
Continuing the search for 
life on the red planet, the 
Mars rover Opportunity, part 
of NASA’s Mars Exploration 
Rover Mission, has produced 
new ?ndings that suggest life 
on Mars was once possible. 
The rover found evidence 
that a giant crater is likely to 
have once contained water 
that was just right for micro-
bial life; it wasn’t too acidic 
or salty. Even though the 
rover has long outlived its ex-

Scientists use waves to predict earthquakes 
Scientists at Stanford 
University and MIT are now 
using waves as a model to 
understand how a future 
earthquake will impact Cali-
fornia. Instead of focusing 
on when the next earthquake 
will hit, researchers are now 
trying to study the way that 
the earthquake will shake the 
ground and anything on top 
of it. Waves have always been 
understood to create seismic 
?elds in the same manner 
that earthquakes do. How-
ever, they produce such little 
force that they were always 
considered noise. Now, with 
this reassessment, scientists 
have made predictions that 
the next earthquake to hit 
California could be a big one.

If you were to go back in 
history and meet with the ex-
plorers and navigators of yes-
teryear, they would probably 
be wielding — at least one 
— magnetic compass. Whip 
out your compass app on your 
smartphone, and they’d prob-
ably be ?abbergasted — well, 
with that and your time ma-
chine. But how has the com-
pass worked to help everyone 
from ancient Chinese seafar-
ers to today’s Boy Scouts of 
America? And how exactly 
does that timeworn technol-
ogy work in your iPhone?
First, we’ll go over the mag-
netic compass. This trustwor-
thy piece of equipment has 
been around since 200 BCE, 
according to William Lowrie, 
a professor emeritus at ETH 
Zurich. Navigators started us-
ing this compass regularly on 
land and sea closer to 1000 
CE, in present-day China. The 
standard magnetic compass 
of the 20th century is made 
up of a magnetized needle in 
its heart with a face showing 
cardinal directions — north, 
south, east, and west. The 
needle is mounted on a sur-
face with low friction so that 
it can easily turn; if held ?at, 
one end of the needle will 
point toward magnetic north 
and one to magnetic south.
The compass is able to de-
termine north and south due 
to the magnet’s interaction 
with the Earth’s magnetic 
?eld. The cause of the mag-
netic ?eld is not completely 
known, but geologists have 
made hypotheses regarding 
the phenomenon by analyz-
ing the layers of the Earth. 
The Earth is made up of an 
outer crust, followed by the 
upper mantle, the inner man-
tle, the outer core, and then 
?nally the inner core at the 
very center. The inner core 
is made up mostly of mol-
ten iron, but the very center 
of the inner core is under so 
much pressure that the iron 
becomes solid, according to 
howstuffworks.com. It is be-
lieved that the rotation of the 
Earth and the immense heat 
from the core cause the iron to 
move in a rotational pattern. 
This rotational pattern may 
be the source of the magnetic 
?eld that we see on Earth. The 
?eld produced is very weak, 
however, which is why the 
needle on the compass needs 
to be very lightweight and on 
a surface with minimal fric-
tion.
As expected with any tech-
nology created over two mil-
lenniums ago, the compass 
has its issues. First, it has to 
be completely level to work 
— making it rather dif?cult 
to use on something like an 
airplane. Also, a magnetic 
compass can take a long time 
to correct itself. Another con-
fusing thing is that the mag-
netic north pole is actually the 
geographical south pole (and 
vice-versa).
So if the traditional nee-
dle compass works because 
of a small magnet, how do 
the compass apps in phones 
work? As it turns out, the 
smartphones do have a small 
magnetometer, which can 
measure the Earth’s mag-
netic ?eld. This information 
is combined with an accelera-
tor inside the phone. The ac-
celerator gets information re-
garding the phone’s position 
in space. It is able to pinpoint 
the phone’s position from 
solid-state sensors within the 
phone that can measure their 
tilt and movement. The infor-
mation provided by these de-
vices means that the compass 
app can display cardinal direc-
tions no matter which orienta-
tion the phone is in, according 
to the algorithmic software 
development company Sensor 
Platforms.
Whether using a 200 BCE  
compass or the compass app 
on the iPhone 5S, the Earth’s 
magnetic ?eld is the key to 
having reliable directions. 
Now, if only Apple could de-
velop a moral compass app.

Solar Splash takes the next big step
BROOKE KUEI
SciTech Editor
In a small, cluttered room 
in the basement of the East 
Campus Garage, magic is hap-
pening. Nathaniel Krasnoff, 
senior mechanical engineer-
ing major and the president 
of the Carnegie Mellon Solar 
Splash team, spends hours 
working alongside his dedi-
cated teammates, including 
senior mechanical engineer 
KJ Lee, to build an impressive, 
solar-powered boat that will 
race in two European compe-
titions during the upcoming 
summer.
According to the of?cial 
website, Solar Splash is “an 
international intercollegiate 
solar/electric boat regatta” 
sponsored by the Institute 
of Electrical and Electron-
ics Engineers (IEEE) Power 
Electronics Society. The main 
events that the competition 
consists of include the sla-
lom, endurance, and sprint. 
The slalom event is a test of 
maneuverability in which the 
boat must navigate around 
several buoys. In the endur-
ance event, the boat has two 
hours to complete as many 
laps as possible around a pre-
determined loop with energy 
provided by a combination 
of solar panels and lead-acid 
batteries. The sprint is exactly 
as it sounds — a test of speed 
across a much shorter course.
Carnegie Mellon’s Solar 
Splash has competed con-
sistently in the of?cial Solar 
Splash competition every year, 
with the exception of last year. 
This year, however, the team 
is back with renewed vigor 
and even higher aspirations 
than before: The team will be 
competing in the DONG En-
ergy Solar Challenge, a solar 
boat competition that will be 
held in the Netherlands this 
June. The team has also been 
invited to participate in the in-
augural Monaco Solar Grand 
Prix in July.
Krasnoff joked that the So-
lar Splash team was always 
seen as second to buggy at 
Carnegie Mellon. “So for us, 
always being the second child 
and now competing on be-
half of the United States is a 
big step. We are honored and 
humbled and excited.”
The Solar Splash team cur-
rently consists of 40 members, 
although a main 10-member 
group is the core of the team. 
The team consists of members 
from various different aca-
demic backgrounds, including 
“So for us, always being the 
second child and now competing 
on behalf of the United States is 
a big step. We are honored and 
humbled and excited.”

mechanical engineering and 
electrical and computer en-
gineering, and works in spe-
cialized groups, such as hull, 
propulsion, and electrical — 
each with its own vice presi-
dent. Their work space is split 
between Bramer House and 
the East Campus Garage 
basement.
Krasnoff made a point of 
remarking that their new hull 
vice president, freshman Sha-
rina Lall, is a biology major, 
although her experience with 
Solar Splash has actually 
made her consider switching 
into the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology (CIT). Their 
electrical vice president, 
sophomore Thomas Eliot, 
was originally a mechanical 
engineer but changed his ma-
jor to electrical and computer 
engineering after his experi-
ence with Solar Splash. Their 
new propulsion head, fresh-
man Kira Fujibayashi, is an 
economics major who is in 
the process of switching into 
mechanical engineering.
“People do really get excit-
ed about what they’re learn-
ing here,” Krasnoff said. The 
process of learning how to 
build an electric solar-pow-
ered boat is entirely different 
than how students learn in 
the classroom. In fact, when 
the team was younger, they 
essentially had to start from 
square one. 
“We had no idea how to 
build a boat,” Krasnoff admit-
ted. “We had no money, we 
were kicked out of our space 
behind Hamburg Hall, and 
we had no members. Now we 
have enough money for this 
new amazing adventure, two 
spaces, and 40 members.”
The actual process of 
building the boat begins with 
a boat design software called 
Michlet. One can set a series 
of parameters, such as how 
fast the boat needs to go or 
how long it needs to be, and 
Michlet, an evolutionary soft-
ware, will run hundreds of 
iterations until an optimized 
model is created. After this 
process, molds are made by 
Advanced Pattern Works, an 
independently owned and 
operated model-making ser-
vice. Carnegie Mellon Solar 
Splash has many sponsors, 
including Constellation En-
ergy, CIT, the Steinbrenner 
Institute for Environmental 
Education and Research, the 
Richard King Mellon Founda-
tion Institute, and Lockheed 
Martin.
“When we ?rst came, re-
ally, there was nothing. No 
one knew anything,” Lee 
said. “But you learn. You fail 
and you learn, and now we’re 
entering an international 
competition, and it’s a big 
change. It’s been two years 
in the making, so it’s almost 
like a movie.” With the in-
tellect and dedication that 
the members of Solar Splash 
have shown in past years, this 
summer’s European com-
petitions are sure to be this 
movie’s happy ending.

vices and gadgets are becom-
ing increasingly prevalent in 
people’s everyday lives. What 
if, however, all this technol-
ogy that we have become so 
reliant on fails?
On Dec. 17, 2013, Target 
announced that payment in-
formation was stolen from 40 
million customers. Since then, 
this prediction has grown to 
as high as 110 million custom-
ers. By installing software on 
the point-of-sale (POS) sys-
tems, the hackers were able to 
steal credit card information, 
names, addresses, and other 
personal information of Tar-
get customers. Customers and 
the media immediately placed 
the blame on Target for negli-
gence of their cyber security 
systems. 
The issue of system failure 
is not unique to Target — simi-
lar headlines have appeared 
before, including in the case 
of Toyota’s recall due to break 
failure in 2010. How do we 
deal with these breakdowns 
of the technology we put so 
much trust in? Who do we 
hold liable?
In the case of the Tar-
get breach, it was instantly 
concluded that the company 
was at fault. They must have 
been careless in making their 
purchase of their hardware. 
On the other hand, if the tech-
nology is faulty, surely the 
manufacturers are the ones at 
fault. The POS systems were 
overridden by open source 
software; the makers cer-
tainly should have predicted 
this would happen. There are 
three important points that 
must be made in order to 
prove liability.
First, did someone get 
hurt? It must be proven that 
there was some cost to a per-
son or property as a result of 
the mistake. In the case of 
Target, releasing information 
about customers’ information 
subjects them to unauthor-
ized charges to their bank ac-
counts or identity theft. 
Second, did the company 
make its best effort to under-
stand the risk? If the company 
was negligent by ignoring the 
risk and not taking the pre-
cautions to prevent it, then it 
is dif?cult for them to claim 
innocence. 
To prove Target guilty of 
negligence, it must ?rst be 
proven that they did not take 
care to optimize their security 
and were not aware of the hole 
in their system. Third, did the 
user get enough information? 
If there is any potential risk of 
using a product, the consumer 
must be made aware of the 
possibility.
A ?nal point to be consid-
ered is the legislation behind 
the technology’s production 
and use. For example, the 
United States government 
is notorious in the world 
of pharmaceuticals for ex-
tremely strict regulations. 
Because of these restrictions, 
people are less likely to suf-
fer from incorrectly adminis-
tered or unknowingly harmful 
medication. 
What if the structure that 
the United States puts on 
pharmaceutical regulations 
were replicated for technol-
ogy? If the government put 
more stress on reducing the 
risk of inventions before they 
are released to the public, we 
could stop more malicious 
technology failures.
However, with this system, 
there is potential to sti?e inno-
vation. The U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Servic-
es reported in 2010 that 40-60 
percent of clinical trials for 
products regulated by the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) are tested outside 
the country. 
With lower standards for 
drug administration, it is 
easier to test and understand 
the product. Research and de-
velopment becomes harder to 
conduct under strict rules and 
regulations.
Looking into the future, 
this burst in technological de-
velopment does not appear to 
be slowing. It is up to us to ?nd 
the balance in responsibility 
in order to prevent disasters 
while preserving innovation. 
Understanding the subtle-
ties of liability and research 
and development legislation 
can help us make informed 
decisions about the technol-
ogy that has become a perma-
nent ?xture in our everyday 
lives.
Pugwash is a non-advocacy, 
educational organization that 
meets on a weekly basis to dis-
cuss the implications of science, 
technology, and medicine in so-
ciety. This is a summary of last 
week’s discussion on technology 
and liability.

Overview of recent discoveries at CMU
BROOKE KUEI
SciTech Editor
Carnegie Mellon’s re-
searchers are constantly 
making new discoveries in 
various ?elds of science. 
Here are summaries of 
some recent ?ndings that 
you might have missed. 
 
Using cuttle?sh ink as 
novel battery materials
Researchers: Assistant pro-
fessor of materials science 
and biomedical engineering 
Christopher Bettinger and as-
sociate professor of materials 
science and engineering and 
engineering and public policy 
Jay Whitacre.
Discovery: Cuttle?sh are a 
type of marine animal closely 
related to squid, octopuses, 
and nautiluses. Though they 
seem to be an unlikely choice 
of study for a pair of scien-
tists who work with batter-
ies, Bettinger and Whitacre 
have discovered that the ink 
from cuttle?sh “provides the 
perfect chemistry and nano-
structure to power tiny elec-
tronic devices,” according to 
a university press release. In 
particular, cuttle?sh will be 
useful in applications that 
are performed close to sen-
sitive living tissue, such as 
for edible medical devices. 
The reason why cuttle?sh 
ink is such an effective elec-
trode material is that the 
melanin pigments in the ink 
exhibit charge storage ca-
pacities that are higher than 
those of synthetic melanin. 
 
New developments in hy-
dropower generation
Researcher: Professor of 
electrical and computer en-
gineering Diana Marculescu.
Discovery: Hydropower — 
power that comes from the 
energy of moving water — 
is generally implemented in 
places where a lot of energy 
can be harnessed at once, 
such as at sites of large dams 
or water turbines. However, 
Marculescu is developing 
a way to make hydropower 
more ef?cient by generat-
ing smaller amounts of elec-
tricity in a larger amount of 
places. By using a process 
called hydrokinetic power ex-
traction, Marculescu and her 
team will be able to harness 
small amounts of kinetic en-
ergy from multiple different 
water locations in a way that 
is both cheaper and more en-
vironmentally friendly than 
conventional hydropower 
methods. 
 
Measuring the universe 
to 1 percent accuracy
Researchers: Assistant 
professor of physics Shirley 
Ho and postdoctoral fellow 
of physics Mariana Vargas-
Magaña.
Discovery: In astronomy, 
a standard ruler is an astro-
nomical object that has a 
known size. By combining 
this known size with the mea-
sured angular diameter of the 
object in the sky, its distance 
from the observer can be de-
termined. The Sloan Digital 
Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) — 
which Ho and Vargas-Maga-
ña are members of — uses 
baryon acoustic oscillations 
(BAO) — imprints of sound 
waves from the early uni-
verse that can be observed to-
day in the distribution of gal-
axies — as a standard ruler. 
Ho and Vargas-Magaña mea-
sured BAO in parallel and 
perpendicular directions to 
gain a better understanding 
of the standard ruler, helping 
SDSS-III measure the scale of 
the universe to an accuracy of 
1 percent.

Bagless Entropy+ smart move for a greener campus
Entropy+ is of?cially going ba-
gless. Starting next month, the 
campus convenience store plans to 
drastically reduce their use of plastic 
bags. No longer will students be able 
to carry out their purchases in plastic 
bags. Instead, they will be encour-
aged to use their backpacks, purses, 
or other reusable bags for transport. 
To ease the transition, Entropy+ will 
be selling inexpensive, recyclable 
tote bags.
The Tartan applauds Carnegie 
Mellon — and one of its most fre-
quented locales on campus — for 
continuing to take steps towards en-
vironmental ef?ciency.
Non-biodegradable and crude 
oil-guzzling plastic bags are a ma-
jor source of pollution and are dev-
astating to marine life worldwide, 
according to livestrong.com. Many 
city, state, and national governments 
are taking action to tax or outright 
ban plastic bag use, and it is highly 
encouraging to see Carnegie Mellon 
following this trend.
With this environmentally-friend-
ly initiative, Carnegie Mellon dem-
onstrates its willingness to be active 
in pursuing change. Cutting out 
plastic bags places service to the en-
vironment before mere convenience, 
which is exactly the kind of prioritiz-
ing people everywhere need to do 
to protect and preserve our environ-
mental health and integrity.
However, it is important to note 
that any step in the right direction 
cannot be followed by complacency. 
As a university known for innova-
tion, Carnegie Mellon must contin-
ue to progress in its environmental 
standards. Whether it be large-scale 
movements such as improving facili-
ties with more LEED certi?cations or 
transitioning towards clean energy, 
or small-scale movements such as 
offering incentives for students to 
reduce the prevalence of plastic wa-
ter bottles, The Tartan encourages 
Carnegie Mellon to continue setting 
an example for what a green college 
campus should be.
Last Monday, the Carnegie Mel-
lon campus community celebrated 
the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
with eight events planned through-
out the day. Together, the events, co-
ordinated by Student Affairs, made 
for a satisfying lineup of activities 
to engage the campus community in 
discussing diversity. Students read 
their work at the “15th Anniver-
sary Celebration for the MLK Writ-
ing Awards”, and President Subra 
Suresh made an appearance during 
a listening tour on diversity.
It was good to see Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Student Affairs invested in pro-
viding quality, educational events 
for students and faculty alike to at-
tend. However, these and similar 
events nationwide sometimes fail to 
truly explore and evaluate the depth 
of Dr. King’s legacy.
As Americans, we sometimes for-
get the deeply radical nature of Dr. 
King’s work. This is partially due to 
the dif?culty of acknowledging how 
blatantly and overtly racist our so-
ciety was even a few short decades 
ago, especially given that racism still 
exists today. 
Though re?ecting on Dr. King’s 
more straightforward inspirational 
messages is easier than evaluating 
the whole of his passionate and revo-
lutionary work, it does a disservice 
to a great American leader.
Dr. King’s impact extends far be-
yond his famous “I Have a Dream” 
speech, and it certainly extends be-
yond some idyllic version of color-
blindness, which is too often used 
as a crutch to avoid discussing race 
in America today. Dr. King utterly 
remolded the way American society 
works. He and other leaders of the 
Civil Rights Movement ended the 
absolute terror of living as a black 
American, especially in the South. 
For the ?rst time in American his-
tory, mainstream culture was made 
accountable for the way it treated 
black Americans and all Americans 
of color.
It is easy to slip into the rhetoric 
that paints Dr. King as a passive lead-
er, especially because he was such a 
passionate proponent of nonviolent 
tactics. However, Dr. King’s work was 
a radical example against thoroughly 
overwhelming odds of resistance to-
wards injustice, a fact which should 
be re?ected in MLK celebrations at 
Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere.
MLK day fails to encompass leader’s radical legacy
CMU must inspire improvements in online education
Last week, Carnegie Mellon 
President Subra Suresh was invited 
to the White House along with a 
group of college presidents selected 
by President Obama for a workshop 
on expanding access to university 
education. One of the major topics in 
education associated with Carnegie 
Mellon is online learning, particu-
larly our Open Learning Initiative 
(OLI).
The OLI is described on its of?cial 
website as “a grant-funded group” 
which aims to “create high-quality 
courses and contribute original 
research to improve learning and 
transform higher education.”
As Carnegie Mellon is consid-
ered one of the leaders in online 
education, it should strive to make 
signi?cant improvements in online 
learning. 
Despite the potential inherent in 
online learning, its effectiveness has 
been brought into question in recent 
years. For Carnegie Mellon to make 
the most of its position at the fore-
front of online learning, it needs to 
acknowledge the existing ?aws of 
this technology and pursue improve-
ments to the online learning process.
The OLI offers many free, in-
dependent learning courses, with 
the aim of providing students easy 
access to academic course mate-
rial and immediate feedback mecha-
nisms. However, Managing Director 
of Guided Learning Strategies Dr. 
Frank L. Greenagel states that “de-
velopers don’t seem to be aware of 
how people learn, for they continue 
to use mostly ?awed models,” and 
that “effective e-learning experi-
ences for complex competencies are 
rarely scalable.”
In an academic paper titled “Com-
paring the Effectiveness of Class-
room and Online Learning: Teaching 
Research Methods” Anna Ya Ni of 
California State University San Ber-
nardino reports that of the classes 
evaluated “two of the online classes 
have higher failure rates as com-
pared to face-to-face classes [and] 
ten percent of students failed in on-
line classes, whereas only 4 percent 
did in classroom sessions among the 
six classes under study.” 
It also added that “the results in-
dicate that failure rate is consistently 
higher in online research methods 
classes no matter who teaches the 
class: 8 percent of students fail in on-
line class as compared to 3 percent in 
face-to-face class in general.”
Learning is not limited to informa-
tion retention and test performance, 
but also includes improvement as a 
person. Online education may lack 
the social interaction and connection 
with professors and classmates nec-
essary to attain this kind of holistic 
learning.
If Carnegie Mellon is to be recog-
nized for pioneering a novel kind of 
education, it needs to acknowledge 
that education’s shortcomings. Ad-
ditionally, it needs to be responsible 
in how it uses and presents new tech-
nology, and strive to provide com-
prehensive improvement.
Internet addiction can be fought with reality focus  
JUSTIN YAN
In Daxing, a suburb of Beijing, 
there is a curious building that is 
called a rehabilitation center. It is 
quite literally used to treat Internet 
addiction.
The facility is meant to be a so-
lution for Internet junkies, whose 
population has risen dramatically 
thanks to the widespread availabili-
ty of cheaper Internet and the popu-
larity of online games, such as World 
of Warcraft and League of Legends.
According to The New York Times, 
the facility in Daxing boasts a 70 
percent success rate. What does this 
treatment include? Well, it’s much 
like military school summer camp. 
Students are kept in dorms, guard-
ed by adults. They abide by a strict 
schedule of physical activity and 
careful diets. Some are even peri-
odically put on medication. On the 
whole, the camp is designed for pa-
tients to strengthen their bonds with 
reality.
In this day and age, Internet us-
age is everywhere. But at what point 
does Internet use cross into addic-
tion that requires psychiatric help? 
It’s a very thin line that is somewhat 
arbitrary. Internet addiction camps 
exist to help Internet junkies recon-
nect, not to a laptop, but to life. Life 
outside the computer is something 
that educators need to start address-
ing. There are skills, values, and 
traditions to be sought outside of an 
LCD monitor, like physical activity, 
social interaction, and books — clas-
sic elementary school values that 
can be lost if computers are used in a 
casual fashion in education systems.
Imagine this: a student visits Uni-
versity Health Services. They don’t 
know anyone there, and they’re 
waiting for a doctor. Five minutes 
pass. What do they do? They pull 
out their phone and browse Face-
book, their email, sports scores, and 
so on. They go on the web. Does this 
cell phone usage count as Internet 
addiction, or rather the more scien-
ti?c name, Internet Addiction Disor-
der (IAD)?
Where’s the line between Inter-
net use and Internet addiction? Ac-
cording to a CNN interview with 
Dr. Charles O’Brien, a psychology 
professor at the University of Penn-
sylvania, any withdrawal anxiety or 
stress as a result of lack of Internet 
use can be considered IAD. In the 
end, adults need to make sure that 
children use the computer in mod-
eration to avoid addiction.
So who usually suffers from IAD? 
Mainly, it’s people who obsessively 
play the aforementioned online 
games. In fact, many popular games 
are played on a professional level 
and include perks like sponsorships 
and television deals. Along with 
China, South Korea is considered 
to be at the forefront of treatment, 
especially because it deals with such 
high levels of both amateur and 
professional gaming. According to 
CNN, 8 percent of South Koreans be-
tween the ages of nine and 39, and 
14 percent of those between the ages 
of nine and 12, suffer from IAD. Vid-
eo games are becoming ingrained in 
the culture of South Korea and, as a 
result, it encourages Korea’s young-
er generation to start playing at an 
early age. Gaming gives children 
stimulation and determination, but 
there’s a point where children play 
too often and become too engaged. 
This addiction is why they need to 
learn in the classroom that the com-
puter is a tool, not something to be 
dependent on.
If IAD is a real thing, how can it 
be stopped? The only reason IAD is 
a legitimate problem is that in coun-
tries like the United States, it is too 
simple to access the Internet. In fact, 
according to the Department of Ed-
ucation, nearly 97 percent of public 
schools in the nation have at least 
one computer per classroom. This 
number makes it so much easier for 
children to learn through multime-
dia teaching methods.
On the other hand, ease of access 
makes it very easy for kids to start 
playing online games. The reason 
IAD has boot camps in both China 
and South Korea is that these coun-
tries have high labor force partici-
pation. Since it is pretty normal for 
both parents to work high-intensity 
jobs, children’s Internet use often 
goes unregulated.
Perhaps introducing technology 
at a higher level of education might 
be a solution, for the United States, 
China, and Korea. The reason these 
rehabilitation centers work is that 
they force children to exert them-
selves in physical activity and other 
actions that don’t rely on technol-
ogy.
So, why shouldn’t schools em-
phasize physical education, such as 
competitive sports? If children don’t 
want to participate in sports, then 
schools should start special inter-
est clubs that involve the arts. Not 
only would this emphasis lead to a 
healthier youth, it would also steer 
children away from addictive gam-
ing and toward more productive 
activities. Technology is most de?-
nitely a blessing, but society cannot 
let it hamper the development of our 
younger generation.

A PERSON’S OPINION

The Tartan is impressed by the massive amounts of snowfall this week. So we asked,
What are you doing to avoid the cold?
Obamacare fails to help the uninsured
KYLE HENSON
The White House recently re-
leased statistics claiming that just 
about 3 million people have signed 
up for health insurance plans through 
either the federal healthcare.gov 
or the state exchanges. While these 
statistics sounds like good news for 
Obamacare on the surface, Aetna 
CEO Mark Bertolini tells a different 
story.
According to a recent interview 
on CNBC, Bertolini estimates that 
about 70 percent of enrollees in Aet-
na plans have paid their ?rst month’s 
premium, which activates the cover-
age that they have chosen. 
More harrowing, however, is the 
fact that only 11 percent of people 
who signed up for Aetna health in-
surance plans were previously un-
insured. Eighty-nine percent of en-
rollees had their coverage canceled 
because of Obamacare and were 
forced into the exchanges as a result. 
This fact is consistent with a study by 
The Wall Street Journal that was also 
recently published.
Extrapolated throughout the 
whole industry, these facts reveal 
that of the 3 million people who 
have enrolled in private insurance, 
just 231,000 of them are uninsured 
people who will actually receive in-
surance because of Obamacare.
Proponents of the law will tell 
you that this statistic is not sym-
bolic of the whole program because 
Obamacare also expanded Medicaid, 
which actually pays for the health-
care of lower-income Americans. 
Supporters will tell you that upwards 
of 4 million people have enrolled in 
Medicaid since Oct. 1 in the states 
that undertook the Medicaid expan-
sion. Don’t believe them.
Medicaid determines eligibility 
based on income, and since incomes 
change all the time, people are con-
stantly moving in and out of Med-
icaid. Senior elections analyst Sean 
Trende of political news website 
realclearpolitics.com estimates that 
only 190,000 people actually en-
rolled in Medicaid as a result of the 
Obamacare expansion in October 
and November. Add an additional 
95,000 for December, and we get 
an estimated number of people who 
were uninsured before Obamacare 
and who will now receive coverage 
as a result of Obamacare. That num-
ber is 516,000 people, which is 1 per-
cent of America’s former uninsured 
and 0.1 percent of all Americans.
Since the open enrollment period 
is halfway through, it’s fair to double 
these numbers and — to be gener-
ous — double them again just to ac-
count for any estimation errors. That 
number comes out to about 0.4 per-
cent of the population. Imagine that, 
if Obamacare were around for ?ve 
years, it ?nally reached an equilib-
rium of people who it is able to help 
out, with enrollments remaining 
constant each year. That’s 2 percent 
of Americans and only 20 percent of 
the uninsured.
Even with these incredibly gener-
ous estimates, Obamacare will likely 
only help 20 percent of the unin-
sured receive coverage. Getting cov-
erage for the uninsured was the en-
tire point of the Affordable Care Act. 
The government upended the insur-
ance industry, canceled plans that 
had happy customers, cost people 
access to their doctors, removed top 
hospitals from plans, increased pre-
miums, forced companies to stop of-
fering part-time workers healthcare, 
and cut full-time workers’ hours to 
part-time. All for what?
At the very best, 80 percent of 
those uninsured now will continue 
to be uninsured. A program with 
a 20 percent success rate is a failed 
program by any standard. Do you get 
surgery from a doctor who succeeds 
20 percent of the time? Absolutely 
not. Obamacare is not working and 
will not work. It won’t do what it’s 
designed to do, and more than help-
ing the lower class, it will make the 
middle class suffer.
People in the middle class gener-
ally make healthy lifestyle choices 
and only need catastrophic cover-
age, which is real insurance in case 
of serious illness or injury — just as 
car insurance only covers accidents 
and not routine maintenance. 
As a result of Obamacare, the 
middle class saw their plans get can-
celed, so they had to buy more ex-
pensive plans to cover services they 
don’t need. The poor are eligible for 
subsidies and the wealthy can afford 
to pay more. Middle class Americans 
have no choice but to pay more for 
healthcare.
Obamacare’s effect on middle 
class Americans is just the most re-
cent drop in the bucket of reasons 
Obamacare should be repealed. The 
GOP summit is ending soon, and 
we’ll just have to wait to see what 
policy solutions they propose to ac-
tually help the uninsured without 
upending one-sixth of the United 
States economy.

Buffer zones essential for reproductive rights
CHLOE THOMPSON
The Supreme Court is currently 
deliberating on a case challenging 
the 2007 Massachusetts law that 
mandates a buffer zone of 35 feet 
around clinics that provide abor-
tions, according to The Boston Globe. 
Anti-abortion protesters maintain 
that the law violates their First 
Amendment right to free speech, 
while healthcare providers and 
members of Planned Parenthood 
argue that the law is essential to 
providing patients with safe and re-
liable healthcare.
The Supreme Court should ab-
solutely uphold the buffer zone law, 
because restricting where people 
can voice their opinions does not 
violate First Amendment rights, as 
long as there are other readily avail-
able venues to do so. 
The buffer zone extends 35 feet, 
which is roughly the length of a 
school bus, and protesters can air 
their views just over the painted line 
that designates the area. Outside 
the buffer zone, people can do and 
say whatever they want.
More importantly, the Supreme 
Court should uphold the law be-
cause people have a right to access 
medical care without being afraid.
The lynchpin of the anti-abortion 
case is that keeping protesters off 
a certain strip of sidewalk violates 
their right to free speech. However, 
the idea of protest-free zones is 
hardly unprecedented. The Supreme 
Court itself has a buffer zone on its 
entire plaza that prohibits picket-
ing, demonstrations, and vigils, ac-
cording to The Boston Globe. Massa-
chusetts institutes a 150-foot buffer 
zone around polling centers on Elec-
tion Day. In these cases, protesters 
or private citizens can express their 
views freely, as long as they stay out-
side of these designated areas.
In the case of abortion clinics, the 
buffer zone is 35 feet, which takes 
the average person around seven 
seconds to walk, according to NPR. 
This space hardly prevents protest-
ers from sharing their views, and 
gives patients a modicum of protec-
tion from demonstrators.
The anti-abortion protesters in 
this case argue that they merely 
wish to have calm and quiet conver-
sations with the people approaching 
the clinics. The principal petitioner 
in the case, Eleanor McCullen, ar-
gues that, “It’s America. I should be 
able to walk and talk gently, loving-
ly, anywhere with anybody,” accord-
ing to NPR. 
If all protesters approached pa-
tients civilly and calmly, then the 
circumstances of the case would be 
different, but the reality is that the 
space surrounding clinics is often 
chaotic, and sometimes violent.
McCullen was an ingenious 
choice for lead plaintiff in this case. 
She is a 77-year-old woman, clearly 
motivated by her religious beliefs, 
and so clearly not a threat to anyone. 
But not all abortion protesters 
have such a kindly visage. Massa-
chusetts Attorney General Martha 
Coakley points out that there is an 
issue of safety on a daily basis at 
these clinics, with patients often be-
ing verbally and physically harassed, 
according to NPR.
Abortion is a legal medical ser-
vice in the United States, and citi-
zens absolutely do not have the 
right or power to determine which 
legal services other people can 
have. Women have the right to ac-
cessible medical care without being 
screamed at or harassed, and with-
out fearing for their own safety.

MPAA must place innovation above unnecessary interrogation
BRANDON SCHMUCK
“They wanted to know who I am, 
where I live, where I work, how much 
I’m making, how many computers 
I have at home, why am I recording 
the movie, who am I going to give the 
recording to, why don’t I just give up 
the guy up the chain, ’cause they are 
not interested in me. Over and over 
and over again.”
This statement was made by the 
man who identi?es himself as TU, a 
man yanked from an AMC movie the-
ater in Columbus, Ohio for wearing 
his Google Glass, which contained 
his prescription lenses. For some odd 
reason, the Motion Picture Associa-
tion of America (MPAA) had been in 
an ordinary Ohio theater at 10 p.m. 
and caught him in the villainous act 
of wearing glasses to improve his 
vision.
The man was held for three and a 
half hours and excessively questioned 
about recording a movie with his 
Google Glass, which had been turned 
off at the time. Strangely enough, 
the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security — an organization created 
to ?ght terrorism — teamed up with 
the MPAA to investigate a potential 
movie piracy incident.
As wearables become mainstream 
over the next few years, the MPAA 
cannot have the right to violate the 
privacy of citizens and waste hours 
of their lives each time they wear 
Google Glasses in a theater. Consid-
ering the inconvenience it caused 
him, TU should be compensated be-
yond the two free movies that the 
MPAA chose to give him as an apol-
ogy for three-and-a-half hours of 
interrogation.
Although the MPAA claimed that 
the interview was completely volun-
tary, TU states that he was threat-
ened with “bad things” happening 
to him if he did not go through with 
it. In truth, it was voluntary — just 
as voluntary as the letters sent out 
to college students by the Record-
ing Industry Association of America 
(RIAA) demanding $3,000 worth of 
voluntary settlements.
Trade organizations, such as the 
MPAA and Recording Industry Asso-
ciation of America (RIAA), have be-
come entirely too powerful, ruining 
the lives of hundreds by over-exag-
gerating cases of piracy and suing ev-
eryday citizens for all that they have. 
These organizations have created an 
atmosphere in which people cannot 
even wear their prescription glasses 
to a movie theater.
Piracy is wrong, as it threatens the 
livelihood of actors, directors, musi-
cians, and developers. However, the 
?ve-year sentence and $250,000 ?ne 
for copyright infringement cited at 
the beginning of each movie is just 
ludicrous. It appears even more ri-
diculous when compared to the aver-
age time served by convicted rapists, 
which is less than six years.
In other words, current laws treat 
movie recording as nearly on par 
with sexual assault. While piracy 
is obviously a problem, it has been 
elevated to the level in which an in-
nocent man has been pulled from a 
theater by federal agents simply for 
wearing smart prescription glasses.
The MPAA should look into work-
ing with companies to ensure that 
people cannot use Google Glass in 
theaters to record movies. Perhaps 
meeting with Google and adding a 
feature to their product that turns off 
video recording in theaters would be 
a better solution. This feature could 
be easily implemented by a Bluetooth 
signal if Google integrated the tech-
nology into its system. This feature 
would be relatively cheap, prevent 
the interrogation of innocent civil-
ians, and more effectively prevent 
piracy.
The United States must reform its 
copyright laws to ensure that similar 
incidents do not occur in the future. 
It must require the MPAA to have suf-
?cient evidence against someone be-
fore ruining an ordinary movie night. 
In addition, it must force the MPAA 
to create new and innovative mea-
sures to prevent piracy, instead of in-
stilling fear in the public and giving 
copyright infringers an assaulter’s 
sentence.

ZEKE ROSENBERG
Junior Staffwriter
The Major League Baseball 
(MLB) organization has a les-
son to relearn. As MLB com-
missioner Bud Selig goes on 
a farewell tour to congratu-
late himself as the man who 
wiped performance-enhanc-
ing drugs (PEDs) from the 
world of baseball, the MLB is 
covered in the blood of New 
York Yankees third baseman 
Alex Rodriguez’s (A-Rod) 
baseball legacy, a mark that, 
years from now, will still look 
more sinister than any other 
PED scandal.
By now, the decision is 
well-known. Rodriguez will be 
suspended for 162 games and 
any potential playoff games. It 
is the longest PED suspension 
in baseball history, extend-
ing almost 60 games longer 
than the 105-game suspension 
handed to former Kansas City 
Royals in?elder Miguel Tejada 
for amphetamine use in 2013.
 The only real surprise, 
however, was that A-Rod did 
not receive the full 211-game 
sentence he was initially given. 
Selig found his last scapegoat 
for PEDs in Rodriguez and was 
above nothing in trying to nail 
down a massive suspension.
The years 2012 and 2013 
were embarrassing for base-
ball’s ?ght against PEDs. Af-
ter Milwaukee Brewer right 
?elder Ryan Braun was one 
of the ?rst players caught by 
the MLB’s testing system, the 
positive test was scrapped 
when it was found there was 
a sample collection mistake in 
arbitration. 
As the testing program 
once again proved to be inef-
fective, the MLB expanded 
its suspension policy beyond 
merely failing a drug test, to 
requiring proof that a player 
took PEDs. This plan has led to 
the MLB ?nding exactly zero 
players using PEDs.
Uncovering the recent 
Biogenesis scandal, in which 
several MLB athletes received 
PEDs from Florida anti-aging 
clinic Biogenesis of America, 
was not the genius work of the 
MLB. A former employee of 
the Biogenesis clinic released 
information to the media 
about the PED abuse. 
The names of the players 
were released, and this proof 
led to 50-game suspensions for 
all involved with two excep-
tions. Braun took a 65-game 
suspension that had a lot to do 
with his ?rst failed test, and 
then there was A-Rod, who 
promised to take this ?ght to 
arbitration and beyond. A-Rod 
has already admitted to using 
PEDs once in his career, but 
that was in the early 2000s 
and he was not suspended 
then. The listing of A-Rod in 
the Biogenesis scandal started 
an ugly, public war between A-
Rod and the MLB.
The initial 211-game sus-
pension levied on A-Rod was 
absurd. It seemed to be inten-
tionally two times longer than 
the longest–ever PED suspen-
sion. Arbitration was able to 
reduce the suspension to a 
similarly unreasonable 162 
games. 
Each separate PED contrib-
uted a loss of 50 games for the 
?rst offense, and an additional 
12 games — as well as playoff 
games — for obstruction. An 
entire season-long suspension 
for A-Rod was considered a 
huge win for the MLB over the 
players union, and Selig made 
sure everyone knew it.
The commissioner is set to 
retire after this season, so this 
?nal blow to PEDs was Selig’s 
swan song. It’s too bad he had 
to drag the union through the 
mud to do it. The MLB paid up-
wards of $125,000 for access 
to A-Rod’s medical records 
and put a witness on payroll. 
A-Rod lost 12 games and the 
playoffs for trying to pay the 
same person to tell his side of 
the story. 
Later, it turned out that A-
Rod’s attempted bribe might 
have been a billing error, but 
that is not the problem in this 
case. Both sides attempted to 
take the battle to the court of 
public opinion.
This public battle is where 
the MLB gets really ugly and 
shows a darker side of the 
spectacle. Strategic leaks and 
media reports by the MLB, 
designed to destroy A-Rod’s 
public image, forced the Major 
League Baseball Players Asso-
ciation (MLPBA) to suspend 
their defense of A-Rod, in or-
der to remain in the public’s 
favor. 
The MLB muscling the 
MLBPA out of the way takes 
the only defense the players 
have against the league com-
pletely out of the picture.
The actions of the MLB, 
such as stealing documents 
and compensating their star 
witness, Bosch, are not only 
questionable, but eerily remi-
niscent of the past.
 Twenty years removed 
from a players strike, it ap-
pears the league has forgot-
ten the animosity that once 
existed between players and 
owners in the MLB, and un-
dermining the MLBPA might 
bring that attitude back. Selig 
attempted to pass a CBA with a 
salary cap and no arbitration, 
preventing the MLBPA from 
actually defending its players.
 What the MLB did recently 
is not identical, but is quite 
similar to what happened in 
1994. 
By pulling the rug out from 
under the MLBPA in arbitra-
tion for A-Rod’s suspension, 
the MLB showed it will sink to 
deep depths in order to get its 
way and make sure the MLBPA 
has to publicly agree or risk 
falling out of favor and losing 
legal power and leverage.
 This action would shift the 
power from the players back 
to the league and bring base-
ball back to a time not long 
ago when four work stoppages 
happened in less than 25 years 
— a large number for such a 
highly paid position.
A-Rod broke the rules and 
the players established a pun-
ishment for what happens 
when someone breaks the 
rules. He should have gotten 
that suspension. 
The 162 games plus play-
offs handed to him shows that 
the MLB would rather take 
down its targets than respect 
the unions designed to protect 
them.  
The relationship between 
the players and owners cannot 
deteriorate once again due to 
the MLB’s power to outmuscle 
the MLBPA in arbitration, for 
fear of another period of work 
stoppages and off-?eld issues 
ruining baseball.
 This case is also interest-
ing when the government’s 
adherence to the law is con-
sidered. The MLB is a heavily 
publicly subsidized organiza-
tion. There’s no reason a gov-
ernment–subsidized organi-
zation should be able to push 
around the union in ways that 
go directly against the spirit of 
labor laws in this nation.
As a Yankee fan, I look 
forward to $25 million being 
taken off the payroll and hope-
fully spent on pitching rather 
than a player who was past his 
prime and struck out nearly 
every at bat. 
Baseball fans can only 
hope that the sport’s haunting 
past never rears its ugly head 
again. The lack of physical evi-
dence that the MLB presented 
shows that it simply lacks the 
capability to catch players 
breaking the rules. 
This inability is not an ex-
cuse to break the rules or to try 
and nail down faces of base-
ball scandals, and that kind 
of scapegoating should never 
have happened.
When Selig pretends to 
have taken PEDs out of base-
ball, he can also pat himself 
on the back for taking the 
trust between the players and 
the league out of baseball — 
again.

Both the men’s and the 
women’s basketball teams lost 
to the University of Chicago in 
two very different games.
The women’s basketball 
team had a hard time holding 
the ?oor against the University 
of Chicago Maroons, who took 
the lead ?ve minutes in and 
never surrendered it. The Tar-
tans had a tough time execut-
ing on offense, and only made 
36 percent of their shots as op-
posed to their season average 
of 44 percent. After jumping 
out to a 5–2 lead, Carnegie 
Mellon surrendered three la-
yups and a three pointer in 
a 9–2 run, and that was the 
?nal lead of the night. Excel-
lent free-throw shooting from 
Chicago contributed to a ?rst 
half that the Tartans  could not 
recover from. By the break, 
the Maroons led 47–29. The 
second half went better, but 
it was not enough to mount a 
comeback against Chicago. 
The win came in spite of 
continued stellar play from 
?rst-year forward, Lisa Mur-
phy. She put up 22 points 
while shooting very well from 
the free throw line (10–13) 
and hounded both the offen-
sive and defensive glass, ?n-
ishing with 14 rebounds. Ju-
nior guard Gabrielle West also 
had a great second half after 
a shaky ?rst half. She scored 
12 points, all from distance, 
in the second half alone. They 
were two bright spots in what 
turned into a brutal, 88–69 
loss, continuing the team’s 
up-and-down performance in 
conference play.
The men’s basketball team 
was more successful, but ulti-
mately did not fare better after 
taking a 65–64 loss in a nail 
biter. 
A rough start in which 
Carnegie Mellon shot 1–10 
from the ?oor allowed Chica-
go to get off to a 14–3 lead as 
the game began, but that was 
the ?rst in what seemed like 
an endless series of runs.
The teams traded runs un-
til, by the break, the Maroons 
had jumped out to a 37–31 
advantage. The second half 
was similar. Runs of 9–2 and 
8–0 eventually put the Tartans 
ahead of the Maroons 54–53 
for their ?rst lead of the night 
with just over seven minutes 
remaining.
 The lead was extended to 
?ve and, with four minutes 
left, the Tartans had their larg-
est lead of the night. The lead 
held until the Maroon’s junior 
guard Royce Muskeyvalley hit 
a dagger to give the Maroons 
the 65–64 advantage with 1.4 
seconds remaining. Senior 
guard Rashaun Riley’s answer 
was just too long and the Tar-
tans came away with a loss.
Senior guard Christian 
Manoli hit the turnaround 
jumper to give Carnegie Mel-
lon its ?rst lead of the night 
and continued his shooting 
streak, scoring 23 points and 
leading the charge for a Carn-
egie Mellon team that very 
nearly came away with a con-
ference win. 
On Sunday evening, the 
teams took the court at home 
against the Washington Uni-
versity Bears. Both teams suf-
fered losses. 
The women’s team lost 71–
63 to the Bears, who are cur-
rently the number two team 
in their section, and the men’s 
team lost 94–81 to the eighth 
ranked men’s team.
 Both teams have had a 
tough time in conference play 
and look to right the ship next 
Friday when they host the 
New York University men’s 
and women’s teams at 8 p.m.

A large portion of America 
will watch football for the ?rst 
time all season next Sunday as 
Superbowl XLVIII airs. Never 
fear, uninformed viewer — 
The Tartan is here to make 
sure you have at least some 
idea about what is happening. 
 
The Football
The game features the Se-
attle Seahawks against the 
Denver Broncos. Both ?nished 
with the top seed in their re-
spective conferences and had 
home ?eld advantage through 
the playoffs up until this point.
The Seahawks are a pri-
marily defensive team. Led by 
their hard-hitting secondary, 
the Seahawks are a suffocat-
ing team that embodies the 
defense-wins-championships 
mentality. Pro-Bowl Seahawks 
cornerback Richard Sher-
man became the face of the 
team last week when he was 
interviewed right after the Se-
ahawks’ win over their rivals, 
the San Francisco 49ers.
Sherman shouted: “I’m the 
best corner in the game! When 
you try me with a sorry re-
ceiver like Crabtree, that’s the 
result you gonna get! Don’t 
you ever talk about me.” This 
interview came on the heels 
of Sherman de?ecting a po-
tentially game-winning touch-
down pass aimed at 49ers re-
ceiver Michael Crabtree for a 
game-clinching interception.
Sherman’s play and antics 
have further overshadowed 
the consistent, yet unimpres-
sive play of the Seahawks of-
fense. Led by running back 
Marshawn “Beast Mode” 
Lynch, the Seahawks consis-
tently pound the football, fo-
cusing on ball control more 
than long touchdown throws. 
Second-year quarterback Rus-
sell Wilson has not put up the 
gaudy numbers of his draft 
class peers Indianapolis Colts 
quarterback Andrew Luck and 
Washington Redskins quar-
terback Robert Griffen III. 
Instead, he acts as more of a 
protector of the football, wait-
ing for the right moment to 
burst out with a long play by 
improvising with his legs and 
accurate arm.
The one ace in the hole for 
the Seahawks is the return of 
wide receiver Percy Harvin. 
Acquired from the Minnesota 
Vikings for a ?rst-round pick 
this past offseason, Harvin has 
seen very limited playing time 
since sustaining a variety of 
injuries over the course of the 
season. However, his speed 
remains unmatched in the 
league, so expect to see Harvin 
running all over the ?eld on 
Sunday trying to make things 
dif?cult for the Broncos.
The Broncos are the perfect 
foil for the Seahawks, relying 
heavily on their high-?ying of-
fense for most of their wins. 
Quarterback Peyton Manning 
had the greatest statistical sea-
son of any passer in NFL histo-
ry, setting the record for most 
touchdowns and most pass-
ing yardage. With a variety of 
weapons — all-pro wideouts 
Demarius Thomas, Erin Deck-
er, and Wes Welker, along with 
breakout star, tight end Julius 
Thomas — it is nearly impos-
sible to fully cover all of Man-
ning’s targets on any given 
play. When combined with 
the two-headed running game 
of running back Knowshon 
Moreno and rookie running 
back Montee Ball, containing 
the Denver offense is no easy 
task.
On the defensive side of 
the ball, the Broncos still have 
a top-10 unit more than ca-
pable of stopping the pass and 
the run. Large defensive tackle 
Terrance “Pot Roast” Knighton 
looks to play a large role in 
containing Lynch and forcing 
Wilson to beat the Broncos 
with his arm and not his run-
ning ability. The loss of all-
pro linebacker Von Miller to 
a torn ACL has certainly hurt 
the squad, but backup Danny 
Trevathan has done a tremen-
dous job ?lling in for him. 
 
The Halftime Show
The Super Bowl halftime 
show is a huge guarantee for 
media exposure, which is why 
superstar artists are willing to 
perform for little to no pay. 
This year Grammy Award-win-
ner Bruno Mars was tapped to 
perform in front of the world’s 
largest television audience. 
We can look forward to huge 
sets and visual effects as Mars 
sings with guest performers 
Red Hot Chili Peppers.
The biggest point of in-
trigue surrounding the half-
time show, other than the 
set list, will be the impact of 
the weather. With the Super 
Bowl being hosted in an open-

in the beginning of Febru-
ary, there is no guarantee of 
good weather and a possibil-
ity of freezing temperatures

both traditionally perform

their adaptation to the cold 
will be interesting to watch. 
 
The Ads
The ?nal piece of the Su-
per Bowl viewing experience 
is the ads. With a 30-second 
advertisement spot costing 
around $4 million, advertis-
ers go out of their way to make 
sure they have an impact and 
stay with their audience. In 
the past, some of the best ad-
vertisements have been from 
Doritos, which uses fan sub-
missions with a million-dollar 
prize for the winners, and 
beer companies who fully un-
derstand who their primary 
demographic is.
But not all Super Bowl 
advertising has to cost a lot 
of money. During last year’s 
power outage, Oreo tweeted a 
picture referencing the black-
out. This tweet went viral as 
people wanted to share the 
humorous and timely picture 
with friends and family. This 
tweet was marked as one of 
the most successful social 
marketing images of the year, 
and gained as much, if not 
more, exposure from the Su-
per Bowl than the companies 
that paid millions of dollars 
for 30 seconds of air time. 
 
The Prop Bets

Her tells touching love story
Spike Jonze ?lm celebrates the challenges of connection
In the not-too-distant future, operating systems have 
surpassed human intelligence, and the only place 
left to buy clothes from is American Apparel. That 
is the world that Her drops viewers in. Directed by 
Spike Jonze, this movie was recently nominated for 
the Academy Award for Best Picture. 
The film follows Theodore Twombly, played by 
Joaquin Phoenix, a divorced man struggling with 
loneliness who sees an advertisement for an 
artificially intelligent operating system and decides 
to buy it. He then meets his operating system, 
Samantha, played by Scarlett Johansson, and their 
relationship begins to form and grow in interesting 
ways.
Her is an incredible science fiction film — and 
a fantastic film in general — because it not only 
portrays a realistic vision of the future and the 
issues that society will have to face, but because it 
also explores the ever-present struggles of human 
nature.
After viewing many movie trailers and commercials 
for the film, it’s easy to imagine the emotional depth 
that the film aims for. However, one thing that may 
catch viewers off-guard is just how funny Her is. 
Sometimes subtle, often vulgar, occasionally deep; 
all of these varied comedic moments strike the right 
notes with perfect timing within the film, making 
sure Her does not become too heavy and keeping 
it believable. After remembering that the movie is 
directed by Spike Jonze — who has collaborated 
with the likes of the team behind Jackass — it’s 
easy to see where the film gets its sense of humor.
Another aspect of the film that works well is its 
portrayal of the not-too-distant future. Filmed in 
Los Angeles and Shanghai, the urban setting 
creates great parallels between the large population 
density and the loneliness felt by the various 
characters throughout the movie. There’s this 
distance between how busy and populated future 
Los Angeles is and how the characters — especially 
Theodore — cope with their struggles in connecting 
with individuals and society as a whole. The film 
utilizes this great aesthetic as well, creating a future 
that isn’t drenched in chrome, but instead full of life.
While the film is phenomenal, the ways in which 
Jonze handles some of the secondary characters 
is problematic. Olivia Wilde’s character feels fairly 
single-note and doesn’t have much screen time, 
which is unfortunate due to what she represents in 
Theodore’s emotional progression throughout the 
film. 
Additionally, Chris Pratt’s performance as Paul, 
Theodore’s boss, received very little billing in the 
film’s promotion. He provides quite a few 
laughs and an interesting perspective on Theodore 
and Samantha’s relationship, though.
However, those faults are easily overshadowed by 
the main performances. The relationship between 
Theodore and Samantha feels authentic, and it 
grows and develops with the added issues that arise 
from Samantha being an operating system. 
Theodore and Samantha both have to deal with 
loneliness, love, expressing their emotions, and 
learning how to connect with others. Ultimately, 
this is what Her is about: How the ability to connect 
with and open up to someone is one of the scariest, 
and most rewarding, parts of life. How we open 
up to others as a society may change over time — 
whether it’s through handwritten love letters or a 
string of emojis — but ultimately those connections 
can lead to the deepest feelings and experiences.
As a film, Her certainly deserves its recent award 
nominations. It’s visually enticing, with great 
performances that provoke a lot of thought. A 
definite contender for Best Picture, it is a fantastic 
film that explores interesting concepts while staying 
true to human nature.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Matt and Ryan,
I live off campus, so I 
have a long trek to class 
everyday. With this polar 
vortex and the snow, 
I’m getting really tired 
of Pittsburgh weather. 
But all this misery gave 
me an idea. I heard that 
the organizers of the 
Olympics in Sochi were 
importing snow in order 
to have enough. I think 
Pittsburgh should start 
exporting it and Carmegie 
Mellon’s the perfect 
place to figure out how to 
make this happen. With 
all the engineers, and the 
business kids, I think the 
student body could make 
a killing.
Innovative Cold 
Engineering, Pittsburgh 
Grade Hielo
Dear ICE-PGH,
We also heard that the 
Sochi organizers were 
stockpiling snow, however 
you have beat us to the 
punch when it comes to 
monetizing Pittsburgh’s 
current predicament. 
Ryan has done some 
calculations regarding the 
melting rate of snow and 
Matt thinks we should 
leverage Amazon’s fleet 
of drones. We are still 
coordinating the no-drone 
rules in New Jersey, but 
the no-fly zone over Serbia 
was lifted last decade, 
therefore socio-politically 
we should be okay. What’s 
that? We only have two 
weeks to get 710,000 
cubic meters of snow 
nearly 6000 miles?
CMU students don’t sleep 
anyway,
Ryan and Matt
Dear Matt and Ryan,
Within the past few 
weeks, all that I seem to 
hear about is that new 
movie Frozen. Everyone 
is obsessed with the 
movie, the songs, and the 
parodies. It never ends! 
I’m really confused and 
frankly, kind of annoyed. 
What’s the big deal? It’s 
that chick from Wicked in 
an animated movie about 
snow. As if I want to see 
more of that these days. 
Sure, maybe if I had a 
snowman and reindeer 
to hang out with, I’d sing 
about how I can pop 
snow out of my fingers 
too. But I don’t, so I’m 
not interested. Can you 
shed some light on this? 
What’s the big deal about 
this movie?
Convinced Otherwise L. 
D. HEARTED
Dear COLDHEARTED,
We hear you, and we 
get you. Despite nearly 
everyone’s obsession 
with this film, we are not 
convinced. Don’t get us 
wrong — it looks cute as 
a button. But the fact that 
our Twitter feeds have 
become one long page 
of lyrics about dancing 
around in the cold is just 
plain obnoxious. We wish 
we could explain it better. 
Really, we do. The best we 
can offer is to check out 
this new song we heard 
the other day called “Let 
It Go.”
Hang in there, you cold-
hearted human, you,
Ryan and Matt

There was the year that skinny jeans came into style. 
Leggings also reentered the fashion world a few years 
ago, followed by circle scarves and combat boots. All of 
these trends seemed strange when they ?rst appeared 
until nearly everyone began wearing them; that 
generally happens with trends. Now fashion followers are 
wondering what the year 2014 will bring.
It’s too early to predict what styles from the past will 
reappear, which new trends will emerge, and which ones 
will come to an end. If the trends from the Spring 2014 
New York Fashion Week (Sept. 5  - 12) are anything to go 
by, certain trends are set to take the stage. Though most 
people tend to wait for fashion trends to make their mark 
before deciding to follow them, here is a sneak peek into 
this year’s fashion forecast for all you trendsetters out 
there.
One trend that has been in style for the past year or so 
is the menswear-inspired trend, and this trend seems to 
be a major one for spring 2014. White shirts and button 
downs were all over the runways at Fashion Week. With 
2014 comes a new twist on these types of shirts in the 
form of contrasting details, such as leather accents or 
small studs on the collar and cuffs.
Contrasting collar shirts seem like a trend that will not 
last for long, so ?nd one at an inexpensive store like 
Forever 21, rather than investing in one that will cost 
more. To carry this trend into any wardrobe, wear it as a 
statement piece with jeans and boots on casual days, or 
dress it up with a skirt and heels.
Another menswear trend, wide-leg trousers, is also 
making its way into spring 2014. Though most fashion 
experts say that wide-leg trousers will work on any 
body type, these types of pants are un?attering on most 
people. Certain wide-leg trousers are ?attering for many 
people, though, like the bohemian, billowy type found at 
Brandy Melville or Free People.
While it’s too cold to wear them now, the summery wide-
legged trousers look great on anyone with a top that is 
?tted or cropped. These pants are comfortable as well, 
and it is possible for one to get a lot of wear out of them 
once it starts warming up outside.
As it’s still below-freezing outside on most days, it 
might be more applicable to focus on trends ?t for colder 
weather, such as sweaters and jackets.
While sweaters are always good for the transition 
between winter and spring, certain styles are making 
a comeback this season. The emphasis on pop art 
during Fashion Week explains the bright colors and 
large graphics on the sweaters found at stores such as 
Topshop. Their sweaters also feature some of the other 
major trends for spring 2014, which include the furry or 
fuzzy texture, as well as athletic-inspired clothing with 
thick-striped sleeves reminiscent of sports jerseys. These 
sweaters may not be for everyone, but they can be worn 
with dark jeans and combat boots for an edgy look.
As winter turns to spring, it may be time to start 
considering what jacket to wear for spring. Boxy jackets, 
or ones that are cropped, reappeared on the runway and 
are replacing the commonly worn moto jackets, which 
are inspired by biker jackets. Even if these jackets do not 
stay in style for a long time, it is highly likely that they 
will come back.
Bomber jackets are another style that have gone in and 
out of style and are currently back in for this season. 
Either of these types of jacket can be worn with a skirt or 
dress to balance out the toughness.
Some ?nal trends for spring 2014 to take note of are 
metallic items of clothing, the micro-pleat, 3-D details, 
and pale pink. Each of these was seen in different 
clothes on the runway, and can easily be incorporated 
into anyone’s personal style.
As for the metallic trend, wearing a sweater in a metallic 
color, such as the matte gold one on popular online 
shopping destination tobi.com, is a bolder choice. 
The safer option would be a regular top with metallic 
detailing, which can be found at most stores.
Micro-pleated skirts were a major trend for last summer 
and could be found in every color at Urban Out?tters. 
They look great paired with graphic muscle tanks for a 
laid-back look.
Three-dimensional details include anything from sequins 
to beads or any other embellishment and instantly 
glamorize tops and dresses. Pale pink will be everywhere 
this season, but make sure to layer it with something 
edgy to avoid looking childish.
It may be that none of these trends will make their mark 
in 2014. Someone may invent something novel which 
will remain in style for a few years. While the year of 
the poncho is thankfully over and will not return, every 
season brings with it new challenges and possibilities in 
fashion. Wait for the spring 2014 trends to play out, or be 
one of the ?rst to try them!

opera
pillbox 01.27.145
L’etoile gives students a night at the opera
CMU School of Music production of the classic French opera transports audience to past
There is only one word to describe Carnegie Mellon 
School of Music’s production of their most recent opera: 
fabulous. Flamboyant personalities came together with 
terri?c costume design to form a bizarre rendition of 
Emmanuel Chabrier’s L’etoile. Stage director Gregory 
Lehane fully transported the audience to 1877 France.
L’etoile, which literally translates to “The Star,” tells the 
story of Lazuli, a poor peddler who falls in love with a 
princess, Laoula, who is destined to be married to the 
king, Ouf. When Lazuli denounces the king and slaps 
him, Ouf orders Lazuli dead, but his royal astrologer 
explains that with Lazuli’s death, the king’s death 
follows closely. Through a series of dramatic events, 
Lazuli ends up marrying Laoula, only to appear dead 
shortly after, having apparently been shot by of?cials. 
When Lazuli reappears alive after swimming in a lake, 
Ouf is so overwhelmed that he gives his blessing for 
Lazuli and Laoula to live happily together — a rare happy 
ending for an opera.
At typical opera houses, the audience’s hair tends to be 
gray. Many have expressed worry that the listeners of 
opera are slowly dying out. One look at the Philip Chosky 
Theater in Purnell Center for the Arts would tell anyone 
otherwise. Students from all different backgrounds came
together to watch the production. For some, opera is a 
way of life; they live and breathe the music. But that’s 
not true for everyone. L’etoile was many people’s ?rst 
experience with opera, such as freshman computer 
science major William Howard Matchen. “L’etoile was 
a thrill!” said Matchen. “Hearing the orchestra while 
watching the colorfully-costumed actors interact in 
dialogue, song, and dance is an experience that will 
surely bring me back to the theater.”
Because L’etoile was originally written in French, the 
singing was all done in French with English supertitles 
to make it more understandable. To learn the French 
words, senior vocal performance major Olivia Vadnais 
(Lazuli) recommended sitting down with a dictionary to 
translate all the text. The dialogue, however, was spoken 
in English, creating an interesting mix of languages in 
the performance.
The students in the School of Music were pleasantly 
surprised by the decision to perform this classic opera, 
said Vadnais. She explained that with young voices, it 
is often dif?cult to ?nd an opera suitable for the cast, so 
they often must resort to contemporary operas.
The Carnegie Mellon voice majors were cast as early as 
last May. L’etoile is double-cast with some principal roles  
changing on a Thursday/Saturday and Friday/Sunday 
schedule. The cast included Vadnais and master’s 
student Courtney Elvira Lazuli, junior Joanna Latini 
and junior Stephanie Ramos singing Laoula, and senior 
Nigel Rowe and junior John Teresi singing Ouf. Between 
May and November, they worked on becoming familiar 
with their roles, learning their lines, and practicing their 
French, according to freshman vocal performance major 
and chorus cast member Guillaume Poudrier.
For some, like Rowe who has been performing in operas 
since high school, the characterization was natural. “I 
saw Ouf in a way that’s not entirely different from the 
way I see myself, as a person,” said Rowe. “He’s pretty 
?amboyant, very high energy, and that suits me.”
For others, however, it was more dif?cult. Vadnais, who 
performed in last year’s Into the Woods, had to step into 
the role of a male for the ?rst time, and that took quite 
a bit of practice. “I actually had my boyfriend observe 
and he’d tell me, ‘No, you need to do this with your hips’ 
or ‘Boys never move their hands like that,’ but it was 
de?nitely weird,” she said.
Since November, they have been rehearsing every day, 
perfecting both their voices and their interactions with 
one another and the audience, said Poudrier. Despite 
popular belief, opera singers are responsible for much 
more than singing; they also have to put on an act. 
In this aspect, the School of Music was incredibly 
successful, with every member of the cast performing 
brilliantly.
However, it’s not only the cast that makes up an opera. 
Master’s drama student Daniel Tyler Mathews, the 
team’s costume designer, produced radical pieces that, 
in some dramatic way, gave meaning to the atmosphere 
of L’etoile. “His costumes are perfect for the show,” said 
Rowe. “It’s kind of like walking into a French cabaret at 
the time when the opera was written.” The costumes 
also added a sense of good humor to the show, helping to 
make it the lighthearted, happy opera that it was written 
to be.
Overall, the piece was colorful, tasteful, and wonderfully 
performed. The amount of hard work put into the 
performance was evident, but the amount of fun the 
cast had was also clear. “The stressful moments never 
outweigh the fun I have on stage,” said Rowe. “We just 
have a dynamic on stage where it’s just really fun to be 
on stage with them.” Rowe is unsure of his future plans, 
but he’s happy to have gotten the chance to perform in 
L’etoile this semester.

Subzero temperatures and icy wind chills make it easy 
to contract a case of the winter blues, especially for 
students from states with warmer climates. For Carnegie 
Mellon students, however, a tropical solace is right in 
their backyard. Phipps Conservatory and Botanical 
Gardens currently has its “Orchid and Tropical Bonsai 
Show” on display, offering a warm and colorful reprieve 
from Pittsburgh’s winter weather.
The display starts in the Palm Court, the ?rst room 
that welcomes guests upon entering the botanical 
gardens, and stretches into the two adjacent rooms. The 
Serpentine Room features the conservatory’s tropical 
bonsai collection, and the Sunken Garden displays the 
conservatory’s orchids, which are on display especially 
for this show.
The Orchid Room, a fan favorite according to staff at 
Phipps, features the conservatory’s year-round orchid 
display, and is also incorporated into this show. The 
Orchid Room features glass pieces from regional artists 
Jenn Figg and Matthew McCormack as well. The pieces 
complement the plant life and add to the enchanting feel 
of the room.
The orchids featured in the show offer a colorful, lively, 
and fragrant contrast to the bleak colors of winter 
outside. According to a press release by Phipps, over 
25,000 species of orchids exist in the world, and the 
conservatory features hundreds of them. The Barbara 
Trisherman Slipper Orchid Collection, which was 
“curated to be one of the world’s de?nitive slipper orchid 
resources,” according to the press release, is just one of 
Phipps’s many orchid collections featured in this display.
The tropical bonsai collection features a variety of the 
small Japanese trees that are grown to look old — from 
the typical upright tree to slanted trees, and even a tree 
that grows tiny oranges. Guests receive a pebble upon 
entering the conservatory and can vote for their favorite 
bonsai tree by placing the pebble in a glass jar in front 
of their preferred tree. The tree with the most pebbles 
at the end of the show will be featured on social media, 
according to a Phipps employee.
While viewers can ?nd a splash of color in the orchid 
display, tropical bonsai are “said to give those who 
practice the art a sense of well-being,” according to the 
Phipps press release.
Those interested in starting their own orchid or bonsai 
collections can attend public programs on the cultivation 
and care of the plants on select Saturdays and Sundays 
at 1:30 p.m. in the Tropical Forest Conservatory. The 
classes are included in the price of admission, which, 
for Carnegie Mellon students, is free. Throughout the 
year, Phipps’s adult education program also offers bonsai 
classes on a variety of topics for experienced and novice 
gardeners alike.
Take a break from studying this winter and instead 
enjoy a warm escape from chilly Pittsburgh weather at 
Phipps. The “Orchid and Tropical Bonsai Show” is on 
display until March 9 and is open daily 9:30 a.m. – 5 p.m. 
Saturday through Thursday and 9:30 a.m. – 10 p.m. on 
Fridays.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for “The Desert”, 
the midseason ?nale of The Mindy Project.
TV thrives on sexual tension. It’s just a fact. Sometimes, 
shows drag it out, season after season, using will-they-
won’t-they plots to keep viewers interested. Other times, 
show runners will jump right in after a few seasons and 
try to play the series off of new relationships between 
characters.
The Mindy Project is, thankfully, the latter. At the end of 
last Tuesday’s midseason ?nale, titled “The Desert”, the 
FOX comedy brought together its protagonist, Mindy 
Lahiri (creator and writer Mindy Kaling) and Danny 
Castellano (Chris Messina) in a passionate embrace.
The catch? Mindy had just sent a letter to her very 
recently ex-boyfriend Cliff (Glenn Howerton) explaining 
her desire to make things work. And back in New York, 
Cliff realized his desire to do the same.
For viewers, that moment was a welcome surprise after a 
season of build-up between the pair. In fact, the episode 
showed them together as friends for the majority of 
screen time, and even the most casual viewer could see 
how well they knew and cared for each other.
Show creators are wary of these situations, in which 
main characters that previously showed strong romantic 
tension act on their feelings, because they fear losing 
what made that relationship compelling. A well-known 
example is the 1980s show Moonlighting, which saw a 
signi?cant drop in ratings and cancellation in the season 
following such action on the part of its main characters.
The issue facing The Mindy Project now is whether 
or not Kaling can keep up that same tension-?lled 
relationship after such a huge event.
Currently in its second season, the show has seen a 
huge improvement over the ?rst, which was ?lled with 
potential, but weighed down by extraneous characters 
and situations that seemed forced.
Instead, viewers saw the formation of a true ensemble 
cast this season as the staff of a gynecology practice 
worked and interfered with each other’s lives. Each 
character seemed weird until another one outdid them.
Within the ?rst few minutes of “The Desert”, it’d be 
easy to write Mindy off as insane, after she takes dating 
advice from Gone With the Wind and references Amanda 
Knox as “foxy-knoxy.”
But back in New York, only a few minutes later, nurse 
Morgan Tookers (Ike Barinholtz) is locked in the practice 
bathroom, and the reactions of the rest of the of?ce staff 
may make viewers rethink Mindy’s status as the resident 
weirdo.
Sadly, ratings have not been kind to this gem, but 
perhaps the simultaneously satisfying and unsatisfying 
ending to “The Desert” will bring in more viewers 
looking to see where Kaling takes the fallout. If not, then 
TV is in danger of losing not only a comedy full of quality 
humor, but one full of the heart and meaning that is 
missing elsewhere on television.
Mindy Lahiri is both relatable and distanced by her 
crazy antics; viewers can sympathize with her everyday 
problems but also laugh at the way she deals with 
life. They can write off her dreams of a life lived like a 
romantic comedy, but at the same time wish right along 
with her. Mindy is both everyone and no one.
If you’re not watching, you should be. Don’t be turned off 
by a shaky ?rst season or fear of the Moonlighting curse. 
The Mindy Project is a prime example of comedy that’s 
about more than just being funny.

When kids go into Litwak’s Arcade, they play the ever popular Fix-It Felix game, in 
which a villain named Wreck-It Ralph destroys a building, yet Fix-It Felix is always 
around to save the day. However, when the arcade closes, the characters come 
to life and have dreams of their own. Ralph (played by John C. Reilly) is tired of 
being the villain and aspires to be a hero. In order to prove to himself that he is 
more than just the overlooked bad guy, Ralph decides to journey into the arcade 
universe in order to search for the perfect game where he can ?nally save the day. 
Ralph may seem like a ruthless and gargantuan villain, but Reilly gives him an 
affectionate and sensitive side that makes it easy for the audience to root for him. 
Wreck-It Ralph brings the classic Disney element of wonder and brings new twists 
and laughs as viewers live in the arcade games rather than just play them.

V for Vendetta
Friday, Jan. 31
8 p.m.
Set in a dark futuristic version of Britain, V for Vendetta is a cult classic full of 
stylized action and provocative questions. In the totalitarian regime of Britain, the 
government has become corrupt and abusive. When young and innocent Evey 
Hammond (played by Natalie Portman) is about to be attacked by secret police, 
she is saved by a masked vigilante who goes by the name V (played by Hugo 
Weaving). V is not only a hero, but also a symbol of hope and rebellion against 
the tyrannical regime. With Evey by his side, V sets out to create a revolution to 
destroy the totalitarian government. V for Vendetta is more than just an action 
thriller; it is a piece of great science ?ction which challenges us to question the 
philosophy and politics of our own world.

For those who fought the arctic temperatures that waved 
down through the streets in shivering gusts of wind 
to attend The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s ?rst Gallery 
Crawl of 2014, it was de?nitely worth the numbed 
extremities. This event occurs every quarter and is a 
great opportunity to sample all that the Cultural District 
has to offer. These offerings range from premieres of 
new art collections and lectures to an incredibly graceful 
performance of ?re dancing. Whether you’re looking 
to acquire a new piece for your collection, or just want 
to wander around and strike up a few words with the 
woman selling her artisanal teas, the Gallery Crawl truly 
has something for everyone.
Seeing as there are far too many events for one to 
realistically see everything — especially in a low of 0°F 
— here are a few great excerpts from the evening.
Structures of Time and Space
Friday saw the two ?oors of the Wood Street Galleries 
premiering artist Erwin Redl’s “Structures of Time and 
Space.” The two pieces that are exhibited, “Twists 
and Turns” and “Speed Shift,” differ greatly in terms of 
aesthetics and feel.
“Twists and Turns” is installed in the darkened second 
?oor and features red and purple lasers shot through 
small squares of glass hanging from the ceiling. The 
effect is very space-like, with the lights bouncing around 
the room in a kind of organized chaos. The exhibit is one 
that commands silence and forces all attention on taking 
in the space. Looking up at the ceiling feels more like 
staring at the night sky and seeing a million tiny galaxies 
whizzing by.
“Speed Shift,” on the third ?oor, gives off a much 
different feel than “Twists and Turns.” While one can 
hear another person’s thoughts at “Twists and Turns,” 
Friday saw the third ?oor abuzz with attendees talking 
and ordering drinks. The room is brightly lit and painted 
a jarring white. The installation is comprised of multiple 
rows of lights that wrap around the room and ?ash on 
and off, giving the impression of a slow movement 
inching its way around the perimeter. Compared to 
“Twists and Turns,” “Speed Shift” is much simpler and 
doesn’t feel as inspired as its counterpart. As a whole, 
the room feels as if it’s a discarded set from a 1950’s 
science ?ction B movie.
Life and Death of the Igloo
The 707 Penn Gallery continued its previously-
open exhibit, “Life and Death of the Igloo” by David 
Aschkenas. The collection documents the tearing down 
of the old Pittsburgh Civic Arena — reverently referred 
to as the “Igloo” by Pittsburghers. The images, while 
documenting destruction, are ?lled with enormous heart.
The pictures clearly communicate the fact that the Civic 
Arena wasn’t merely a structure that was torn down, 
but an entire history now only alive in memory. The ?rst 
picture in the collection is a crudely drawn sign on a seat 
near the ?oor of the empty arena that reads, “Thanks 
For The Memories.” An image of workmen folding up 
a banner that reads “Pittsburgh Penguins, Stanley Cup 
Champions 1991-92” feels like thousands of voices 
whispering, “I remember that.”
The gallery being as small as it is, it is also easy to 
hear the voices of other attendees. Walking around 
and gazing at the pictures of piled twisted metal that 
once held thousands of exhilarated fans, small tidbits of 
conversation can be plucked out of the air. This Friday, 
one man and the woman behind the bar struck up a 
conversation about all the concerts they’d seen at the 
Civic Arena back in the day, with words such as “I saw 
Led Zeppelin there on their ?rst major tour.”
Steel Town Fire
On the corner of 7th Street and Penn Avenue at the 
outdoor Agnes R. Katz Plaza, before a large fountain with 
rivers of still ice cascading down the sides, the Steel 
Town Fire performance group set down their ?aming 
paint can to give three performances over the course of 
the night. Given the hazardous nature of dancing with 
open ?ame, the group performed with a kind of graceful 
recklessness that disregarded the frigid air and had 
onlookers tapping each other on the shoulder to share 
their astonishment.
Never stopping their ?uid movement, the performers 
passed one continuous ?ame from object to object, 
which included swords and poi.  
The performance was broken into segments marked 
by changing songs. The group’s soundtrack varied 
from chill drum and bass tracks to music that sounded 
incredibly raw. Some songs allowed the movements of 
the performers to appear as graceful as those of ballet 
dancers, while others forced a kind of raw energy that 
made one feel as if they were watching an old-world 
ritual. The group’s attire, which included small amounts 
of body jewelry and henna face tattoos, also added to the 
ritualistic aesthetic.
Downtown Gallery Crawl offers attendees a sampling of Pittsburgh’s cultural scene
         Despite the frigid temperatures, this quarterly event provided a wide variety of events and premieres that re?ected the best of the city and its people
“Speed Shift”, from the Structures of Time and Space 
series of light instillations by artist Erwin Redl, used 
slowly flashing lights to create an impression of 
motion wrapping around the room.

Night Market
This pop-up indoor market offered a number of different 
things to those who walked in the door. The room felt 
as if it was lit by candlelight, with a single strand of 
white Christmas lights nailed up at haphazard intervals 
stretching around the room.
The front of the room was set up with cafe-style tables 
and chairs facing a performance from a female singer 
and guitarist. She played gentle renditions of covers 
such as Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” and Bon Iver’s 
“Skinny Love” as well as a few well-written original 
songs, and perfectly embodied the kind of casual, 
friendly, and serene atmosphere of the Night Market.
The Night Market had a wide variety of items for sale. 
The ?rst table that greeted visitors was occupied by 
rows and rows of glassware in vibrant colors, while 
the last one showcased Irish cultural items, such as 
pendants and wool driving caps, and was curated by the 
Irish Festival association. 
In between was everything from Pittsburgh-inspired 
T-shirts from the web store DeadBuryDead to boxes 
over?owing with shining silver jewelry and sculptures of 
robots made from assorted pieces of junk metal.
Visitors could easily wander around the market, 
examining the pottery and sharing words. In addition to 
the arts and craft items, vendors sold food items, such as 
sandwiches. Local Pittsburgh roasters Zeke’s Coffee sold 
cups of their exceptional coffee for $1.50. Having roamed 
from event to event in the cold night, it was a wonderful 
experience to sit down with a cup of coffee at a table, 
listen to the serene sound of the live music, and simply 
enjoy the oasis of warmth that the Night Market offered 
to the Gallery Crawl.
Even though it shot right through one’s bones, the 
cold of the night also brought a sense of warmth. After 
braving the distance from building to building, there was 
always a sense of welcome at every door when one could 
unzip their coat and take in a new experience. Seeing 
as the next one will be in warm weather, this quarterly 
event isn’t to be missed.
Top Right: The first floor window of the Renaissance Hotel on Sixth Street is now the temporary home to the 
Lonely Robot, a series of public art installations by artist Toby Atticus Fraley, as he travels the country.
Above: Hosted by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, the Night Market offered visitors everything from 
Pittsburgh-centric artwork to music and conversation.
Left: Performing three times over the course of the night in Agnes R. Katz Plaza, Steel Town Fire wowed audi-
ences with their graceful dancing that incorporated flaming objects.

A year is a long time to keep anyone waiting, let alone a 
rabid fan base hungry for a promised new album. Now, 
after multiple vague seasonal deadlines, bluestep artist 
Gramatik’s new album, The Age of Reason is ?nally here 
and delivers on the implicit promises made during the 
long delay. Bluestep is a combination of American blues 
and dubstep with extensive hip-hop, jazz, and swing 
in?uence as well.
The Age of Reason is very indicative of the new sound 
Gramatik has been exploring over his past few releases, 
especially 2012’s #digitalfreedom. The album opener 
and collaboration with ESKOBARS, “Brave Men,” 
features Gramatik’s biggest drop, with a bottom that 
goes right through the ?oor. While not indicative of the 
whole album’s sound — it certainly stands out due to its 
heaviness — it nonetheless makes a statement with its 
opening placement. This is Gramatik’s sound now: Like 
it or listen to something else.
Despite the move away from natural sounding samples 
to a more dub-inspired sound, there are many great 
things to be found in Gramatik’s new direction. The 
biggest bene?t has to be the increased prominence of 
guitar-playing. Live, Gramatik teams up with a guitarist, 
and the addition gives his performances a human energy 
that is often lacking in electronic acts.
On “Torture,” the stomping track that Gramatik has been 
opening up his live performances with since the summer 
festival circuit, collaborator Eric Krasno channels the 
ghosts of every blues guitarist who ever worked their 
?ngers to the bone searching for that one perfect riff. 
Not to be outdone, the drums on Gramatik’s backing 
track sound more like they’re out of a metal, rather than 
an electronic hip-hop, song, and they punch right in the 
gut.
Other tracks that stand out include the funky 
“Obviously,” a collaboration with Exmag and male pop-
vocal duo Cherub, and the jazzy-yet-heavy “You Don’t 
Understand.” “Pardon My French” has an extremely 
danceable and disco-like feel to it, which is interesting 
to hear coming from the artist who helped make a name 
for himself by creating a blissful hip-hop remix of Led 
Zeppelin’s classic “Stairway to Heaven.” 
The Age of Reason’s best moment comes at the very end 
with the groovy “It’s Just a Ride.” Featuring a calm duel 
of synthesizers and guitar in the beginning, the song 
then shifts into a rough guitar riff before ?nally dropping 
into a steady beat that incorporates all the previous 
elements of the song instead of exploding them off into a 
wall of bass. While his full-on remix of Bassnectar’s 
“Dubuasca” — a track Gramatik played live to great 
acclaim this past summer — was blocked from being 
released, “It’s Just a Ride” uses many components 
of it, especially the wispy and ethereal vocals in the 
background.
Being a strong and outspoken supporter of net neutrality 
and open-access to information, Gramatik releases all 
of his music online for free — often using Facebook and 
Twitter to share the link to his entire discography on 
torrent website The Pirate Bay. His songs can be found 
for download in many places on the net, including his 
website gramatik.net as well as thissongissick.com and 
bittorrent.com.

Gramatik delivers on long-awaited album
The Age of Reason combines numerous in?uences to create a unique and killer sound
During his live performances, Gramatik teams up with a guitarist to give his shows a uniquely human feel 
compared to other electronic/hip-hop acts.
