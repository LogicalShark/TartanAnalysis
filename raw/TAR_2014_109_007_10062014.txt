Norris speaks about race in America

CHELSEA DICKSON
Junior Staffwriter
“America’s conversation on 
race has only just begun,” said 
NPR correspondent Michele 
Norris during a talk on racial 
diversity last Wednesday at 
the Carnegie Music Hall. The 
lecture, titled “Eavesdrop-
ping on America’s Conversa-
tion On Race,” proved more 
than an exercise in listening, 
and rather an invitation to 
an open dialogue on race in 
America. Hosted by the Carn-
egie Museum of Natural His-
tory, the event was held in 
tandem with the museum’s 
new exhibit “Race: Are We So 
Different?”
Michele Norris began host-
ing NPR’s All Things Consid-
ered after working for news 
outlets such as The Washing-
ton Post, the Chicago Tribune, 
and the Los Angeles Times, 
eventually winning both an 
Emmy and Peabody Award for 
her coverage of the Sept. 11 
terror attacks in conjunction 
with ABC News.
In 2006, Norris was in-
spired by the term “post-racial” 
to explore the real conversa-
tions Americans were having 
about race. Today, Norris di-
rects her social experiment, 
“The Race Card Project.” 
People from America and 
elsewhere may send in their 
six-word stories about their 
experiences with race to the 
“Project.” More often than 
not, Norris ?nds people are 
eager to share many of their 
anecdotes.
At her lecture on Wednes-
day, Norris shared some of the 
accounts she’s heard while 
directing “The Race Card 
Project.” 
Once, a woman revealed 
she had saved an invitation to 
a lynching that was sent to her 
father. In a more intimate mo-
ment, Norris recalled learning 
that her own father had been 
shot in Birmingham, Alabama 
after serving in WWII. While 
still in uniform, her father 
attempted to enter a center 
where he was taking a class 
on the Constitution but was 
stopped by a police of?cer. A 
scuf?e ensued, and the of?cer 
attempted to shoot her father. 
Luckily, he escaped with only 
a ?esh wound.
Norris’ father, however, 
never told her about this ex-
perience. Instead, she said, 
he decided “to pass on ambi-
tion” to his children rather 
than a history of violence and 
oppression.
For Norris, these small mo-
ments of racial tension add up 
to create a person’s “wealth.” 
Norris proposed a new de?ni-
tion of wealth in relation to 
race. America’s “wealth” of 
diversity comes from these 
small ways we experience 
race, Norris said.
She said that although 
sometimes people’s words 
might sound harsh or off-
putting, their curiosity to 
talk about race and diversity 
should be encouraged. Norris 
ended the lecture by reading 
some of the six-word “Race 
Card” stories she found funny

Donut Dash raises money for Live Like Lou
Kevin Zheng/Junior Photographer
Donut Dash began with enthusiasm on Sunday morning as contestants ran a mile, ate some donuts, and ran another mile. 
LAURA SCHERB
Operations Manager
Over 500 students, faculty, 
and community members 
participated in the sixth an-
nual Donut Dash on Sunday, a 
yearly event held by the broth-
ers of Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
(SAE).
Junior cognitive science 
major June Hammer Walitzer 
took ?rst place in the women’s 
singles division, and unde-
clared Mellon College of Sci-
ence ?rst-year Joey Pickens 
took ?rst in the men’s singles 
division and overall with a 
time of 12:36.
For the past ?ve years, the 
Donut Dash looked much like 
those held by other organiza-
tions around the country: run, 
eat some donuts, run more, 
and try not to puke. But this 
year’s Dash was transformed, 
thanks to a makeover from 
senior cognitive science and 
human-computer interaction 
double major Jeff Mich.
“Whenever anyone asks 
me what the difference is be-
tween this year’s Dash and 
last year’s, I cut them off,” 
Mich said. “We’re doing ev-
erything differently. We’ve 
rebuilt the event from the 
foundation.”
To make that dream a real-
ity, Mich worked with coordi-
nator of Greek leadership and 
SAE chapter adviser Emily 
Cunningham.
“Last year, I was really 
taken aback by the quirkiness 
of the chapter and the event,” 
Cunningham said. “It’s weird, 
it’s so weird, but it’s so them. 
I love seeing their passion and 
how they can make this goofy 
thing so great, so I wanted to 
help make it a reality.”
Though in the past the 
event raised money for the 
Children’s Hospital, a char-
ity with which Mich said the 
fraternity had a great rela-
tionship, this year, the money 
raised at the event is going to 
Live Like Lou, a Pittsburgh-
based organization that is 
focused not only on funding 
research to ?nd a cure for 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS) or Lou Gehrig’s disease, 
but on helping patients and 
their families by providing 
support and care to create a 
community for those affected 
by the disease.

Andy Awards honor outstanding staff
CHRIS GALVIN
Staffwriter
“Today we honor Carnegie 
Mellon’s best-kept secret: our 
incredible staff. Simply the 
?nest, most hardest working, 
and most dedicated staff in 
the world,” said Cohon Uni-
versity Center Administrator 
Stanley Krowitz at the 20th 
annual Andy Awards.
The Andy Awards, held on 
Sept. 30, honor faculty and 
staff from all over campus 
for outstanding performance 
and contributions to the cam-
pus community.
The ceremony began with 
a speech from President Sub-
ra Suresh that emphasized 
the importance of the behind-
the-scenes work that the uni-
versity’s staff performs.
“[The staff members] are 
the unsung heroes of the en-
terprise,” Suresh said. “That’s 
why I personally believe that 
something like the Andy 
Awards are so critical.”
Suresh also stressed the 
value of the university staff’s 
creative contributions, no 
matter their size.
“What people don’t realize 
is that innovations ... happen 
every day. Very small innova-
tions, from a practical sense, 
can be much more impact-
ful,” Suresh said. “We put a 
man on the moon before we 
put wheels on the suitcase.”
The ?rst awards for Years 
of Service were presented by 
Pattye Stragar, staff council 
chair and ?tness operations 
manager in the department 
of athletics.
“Win or lose, you repre-
sent the best that the staff has 
to offer,” Stragar said. “Your 
contributions are an example 
for all staff who work day in 
and day out to contribute to 
the campus community.”
Sixteen staff members 
were recognized for 30 years 
of service, nine for 35 years, 
and three for 40 years. Chuck 
Gitzen, storeroom manager 
for the physics department, 
was recognized for 45 years 
of service, and Joe Rudman, 
a scienti?c project adminis-
trator also in the physics de-
partment, was recognized for 
55 years of service.
Next, Everett Tademy, 
assistant vice president for 
diversity and equal opportu-
nity services, presented the 
Andy Award for Outstanding 
Dedication.
“These nominees have a 
can-do attitude and consis-
tently do whatever it takes to

Hillman donates $5 million to university
BRIAN TRIMBOLI 
News Editor
Last week, the university 
announced that Henry Hill-
man donated $5 million to 
Carnegie Mellon’s nascent 
BrainHub initiative.
Hillman, referred to in a 
campus-wide email as a “re-
nowned Pittsburgh philan-
thropist,” has donated funds 
to Carnegie Mellon in the past 
to support the construction of 
the Hillman Center for Future-
Generation Technologies.
“The Hillman gift will pro-
vide new endowment funds 
to help support presidential 
graduate fellowships in areas 
broadly connected to brain 
research,” the email said. “It 
will also provide seed grants, 
through CMU’s ProSEED pro-
gram, for innovative research 
projects that will connect fac-
ulty from disciplines across 
CMU.”
The Henry L. Hillman 
Foundation, according to its 
website, is “dedicated to im-
proving the quality of life in 
Pittsburgh and southwestern 
Pennsylvania.” Hillman in-
herited much of his money 
from his grandfather, a Pitts-
burgh steel tycoon and the 
founder of the Pittsburgh 
Coke & Chemical Company, 
according to Business Insider.
“Understanding how the 
brain works is among the 
great challenges of the 21st 
century, with results that 
promise to improve human 
health and well-being in 
dramatic ways,” said Presi-
dent Subra Suresh in a press 
release. “Carnegie Mellon 
can make a unique and dis-
tinctive contribution to this 
global effort by bringing 
together our strengths in 
neurobiology, computation, 
data sciences, human learn-
ing and behavioral science 
to create urgently needed re-
search frameworks, tools and 
technologies, and by working 
in close concert with the net-
work of BrainHub universi-
ties around the world.”
Carnegie Mellon launched 
the BrainHub initiative in 
late August; the initiative in-
cludes plans to expand Carn-
egie Mellon’s brain research 
in several different ways.
As part of the initiative, 
according to the initial press 
release on the subject, the 
university plans to hire 10 or 
more faculty specializing in 
brain research across vari-
ous departments and ?elds. 
BrainHub will focus on devel-
oping better tools to measure 
neuron activity in the brain 
and computational methods 
for analyzing brain activity to 
understand the link between 
activity in the brain and the 
body’s behavior. Hillman is 
one of many sources of fund-
ing for BrainHub. According 
to the press release on Brai-
nHub, Carnegie Mellon has 
secured $75 million in initial 
commitments from organi-
zations like the R.K. Mellon 
Foundation; Dietrich Foun-
dation;  Kris Gopalakrishnan, 
co-founder of business con-
sulting company Infosys; and 
others.
“The gift will help support 
the training of the next gen-
eration of brain researchers 
on a global scale,” the uni-
versity press release says. “As 
part of BrainHub, Carnegie 
Mellon scientists will work 
with university partners from 
China, India and the United 
Kingdom, and the Hillman 
gift will be matched with 
other sources of support for 
BrainHub.”
BrainHub is meant to pave 
the way for new methods 
of measuring and analyzing 
brain activity, as Carnegie 
Mellon scientists work with 
other top brain researchers.
Some of BrainHub’s global 
partners include the Univer-
sity of Warwick, which has 
expertise in the ?eld of digi-
tal health; Sun Yat-sen Uni-
versity, whose medical school 
is clinically experienced with 
autism and Alzheimer’s; 
Oxford University and its 
International Brain Mechan-
ics and Trauma Lab; and the 
Indian Institute of Science, 
which has its own brain re-
search center.

Mary Shaw, the Alan J. 
Perlis university professor of 
computer science at Carnegie 
Mellon, has been selected by 
President Barack Obama to 
receive the National Medal of 
Technology and Innovation, 
the nation’s highest honor 
in recognizing technological 
achievements.
“Building the reliable 
software systems that are 
the bedrock of commerce 
and communication today 
would not be possible with-
out the engineering princi-
ples for large-scale software 
architecture pioneered by 
Mary and her colleagues at 
Carnegie Mellon,” said Carn-
egie Mellon President Subra 
Suresh in a university press 
release.
“Her hard work as a soft-
ware engineer and educator 
has made CMU a leader in 
the ?eld. This national recog-
nition for her contributions 
to technology and society is 
richly deserved, and all of us 
at CMU join in congratulat-
ing her,” Suresh continued.
Shaw has been a part of 
the School of Computer Sci-
ence faculty since 1971 and 
has done pioneering work in 
the ?eld of software architec-
ture (the large-scale struc-
ture of software systems).
Shaw was one of eight re-
cipients of the National Med-
al of Technology and Innova-
tion this year, accompanying 
ten new recipients of the Na-
tional Medal of Science.
Shaw and the rest of the 
award recipients will receive 
their medals at a White House 
ceremony later this year.
“CMU and the city of Pitts-
burgh are so lucky to have had 
Mary living and working here 
over the years,” said Andrew 
W. Moore, dean of the School 
of Computer Science, in a 
university press release. “The 
discipline of computer sci-
ence on campus and around 
the world grew through her; 
her in?uence is exerted every 
day through the thousands of 
in?uential leaders in the soft-
ware industry who have been 
trained here.”

CMU leads NSF project on learning, data
Carnegie Mellon profes-
sor of human-computer in-
teraction and psychology 
Kenneth Koedinger will lead 
a $5 million early implemen-
tation project sponsored by 
the National Science Foun-
dation (NSF) to mine vast 
amounts of educational data 
and create a large, distrib-
uted infrastructure called 
LearnSphere.
“We’ve seen the power 
that data has to improve 
performance in many ?elds, 
from medicine to movie rec-
ommendations,” Koedinger 
said in a university press 
release. “Educational data 
holds the same potential to 
guide the development of 
courses that enhance learn-
ing. Gathering more of this 
data also promises to give us 
a deeper understanding of 
the learning process.”
Researchers for the initia-
tive will help course instruc-
tors improve teaching meth-
ods by looking at the data 
generated by interactive tu-
toring systems, educational 
games, and massive open 
online courses (MOOCs).
LearnSphere received one 
of 14 data-driven research 
awards given by the NSF, 
totaling more than $31 mil-
lion, as part of the Data In-
frastructure Building Blocks 
(DIBBS) program.
“NSF has an ambitious 
vision for advancing scien-
ti?c frontiers through an 
enabling and collaborative 
data infrastructure,” said 
Irene Qualters, NSF divi-
sion director for advanced 
cyberinfrastructure, in the 
press release. “We are par-
ticularly pleased that this 
year’s DIBBs awards include 
this CMU-led project to 
build on the NSF-sponsored 
Pittsburgh Science of Learn-
ing Center’s DataShop re-
pository for educational re-
searchers.”
LearnSphere also ties into 
the university’s Simon Initia-
tive, which aims to use data 
and technology to improve 
how students learn. The Si-
mon DataLab was launched 
last year with the goal of 
making student-teacher in-
teraction data more acces-
sible to instructors. The new 
infrastructure being created 
as part of LearnSphere aims 
to further improve on this 
effort.

Director of Athletics, Physi-
cal Education and Recreation 
Joshua Centor provided a re-
port on the state of university 
athletics and the Jared L. Co-
hon University Center (CUC) 
expansion, highlighting that 
there were 70 student athletes 
with a 4.0 QPA last fall and 
58 with a perfect QPA in the 
spring. Overall, the student 
athlete QPA statistics are on 
par with those of the rest of 
the campus community, and 
109 athletes received the dis-
tinction of “All American” last 
year.
There are currently 18 
varsity sports. The most re-
cent addition is women’s golf. 
There is approximately the 
same number of club athletes 
as varsity athletes. One recent 
change is that club coaches are 
now being paid by the univer-
sity as employees, with their 
salaries coming through the 
athletics department. Centor 
also discussed plans for reno-
vating Skibo Gymnasium and  
putting  a new athletic facil-
ity in the CUC, expected to be 
completed in 2016.
Committee update: Senate Week
For Senate Week, student 
representatives will be giving 
out Senate-branded merchan-
dise to interested students and 
selling T-shirts for ?ve dollars 
to the campus community.
Senate members will be ta-
bling outside of Merson Court-
yard 10 a.m.–2 p.m., Oct. 6–10 
and will be encouraging stu-
dents to “like” the Student Sen-
ate Facebook page as well as 
?ll out surveys regarding stress 
culture, the use of activity fees, 
the possibility of a smoke-free 
campus, and sexual assault 
policies.

or thought-provoking: “It’s 
a non-issue when aliens ar-
rive,” “What ever happened to 
midnight basketball?,” “I am 
Asian, not a genius,” “Ghetto’s 
a place, not an adjective”, 
“Hated for being a white cop,” 
“Delicious ambiguity: the per-
manent in-betweener,” and 
“Still more work to be done” 
to name a few.
Norris’ own six-word sto-
ry? “Fooled them all, not done 
yet.”
Many Carnegie Mellon 
community members who at-
tended the lecture hope that 
projects like “The Race Card 
Project” inspire more campus 
dialogue on race. 
For Assistant Director in 
the Of?ce of the Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Shernell Smith, 
conversations about diversity 
strengthen the Carnegie Mel-
lon community: “Food, fes-
tivals, and fairs only get you 
so far,” Smith said. “With the 
unanswered questions in the 
room — or the elephant in the 
room — these kinds of dia-
logues allow for us to dig a lit-
tle bit deeper and really have 
those meaningful exchanges 
with one another. Because 
those meaningful relation-
ships are about collabora-
tion.... As President Subresh 
said earlier this week, ‘Diver-
sity inspires innovation.’ And 
Carnegie Mellon is ?lled with 
innovation.”
“She really included a lot 
of multicultural issues; she hit 
on Asian ethnicities, Hispanic 
ethnicities, blacks, whites. I 
even like how she mentioned 
how whites are sometimes 
underprivileged because of 
the inability to say certain 
things that colored people 
can,” sophomore English ma-
jor Melanie Diaz said.
For others, the lecture 
sparked some more critical 
thoughts on Carnegie Mel-
lon’s relationship with race.
“CMU has a huge problem 
in that we not only devalue 
the humanities, but we pre-
tend that science and tech-
nology are these holy grails 
of objectivity, when science 
and technology, in both edu-
cation and application, both 
have a huge history of racism 
and sexism,” junior chem-
istry and creative writing 
double major Sophie Zucker 
said. “How can we call sci-
ence and technology today 
not racist and sexist when 
60 years ago we were saying 
that racial differences indi-
cated intelligence?”
Others found the lecture’s 
tone fresh and hopeful.
“It wasn’t just ‘let’s ac-
knowledge that race issues 
are alive,’ ” said the secre-
tary of the Black Graduate 
Students Organization and 
mechanical engineering doc-
toral candidate Nateé John-
son. “It was also ‘Hey, let’s be 
comfortable in our own skin 
while recognizing that it’s 
not that different from some-
one else’s.’ We are naturally 
curious beings. We’re evolved 
to notice differences.… We 
don’t have to let stereotypes 
dictate how we treat people, 
or how we perceive people 
are treating us. This race con-
versation doesn’t have to be 
abrasive.”
Norris talks about racism in U.S.

Neil Alexander, the found-
er of Live Like Lou, spoke at 
the end of the event, saying 
he was impressed with this 
year’s Donut Dash.
“Six months ago, we re-
ceived a phone call from SAE 
asking if they could work with 
us for Donut Dash ... which 
we thought was just about 
the best idea we’ve ever heard 
in our entire lives. This is an 
impressive group of young 
men,” Alexander said.
According to Mich, the 
change was spurred on when 
the house’s alumni adviser, 
Bob Dax, was diagnosed with 
ALS last year. Knowing that 
the disease is fast-paced, the 
brothers decided to honor 
Dax by dedicating their annu-
al fall charity to Live Like Lou.
“I’ve seen ?rsthand how in-
valuable Dax is to the house. 
He is the reason that we are 
still on campus, the reason 
that our house is ?lled with as 
many great guys and strong 
leaders as we are. Somebody 
needed to step up to show him 
how much he means to us,” 
Mich said.
“[Dax] is truly the example 
of the SAE True Gentleman,” 
Alexander said at the event.
In 2013, roughly 64 people 
were responsible for the 
majority of the fraternity’s 
$22,000 funding.
“We could do better; we 
could do so much better. 
That’s not a sustainable ef-
fort, and it’s not fair to our 
donors. They were investing 
in us, and it was our responsi-
bility to show them what that 
money could do — not only 
on a college campus, but in a 
community,” Mich said.
Cunningham was im-
pressed with the fraternity’s 
efforts and organization, 
saying, “Their passion, drive, 
and emotion that has gone 
into making this happen says 
a lot about these men and 
how deeply they understand 
brotherhood and what that 
means. They are truly in-
credible men who have truly 
pushed the boundaries and 
made things happen, and I 
don’t know how they’ve made 
as many things happen as 
they have.”
The fraternity raised 
$100,510.68, the largest sum 
raised by any organization on 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus, 
including collective events 
such as Greek Sing.
“[We] wanted to show this 
campus what it really means 
to fundraise. We care about 
this cause, and even though 
we don’t participate in a ton 
of stuff around campus, this 
is something that we’ve built 
a strong, growing foundation 
for. We don’t do things that 
don’t have a lasting impact. 
We’re setting the expecta-
tions for next year’s leaders,” 
Mich said.
According to Cunning-
ham, the event has become so 
large that it caught the atten-
tion of Nigel Travis, the chief 
executive of?cer of Dunkin’ 
Donuts, who called the frater-
nity last week to thank them 
for placing the largest order 
ever — 9,000 donuts. Dax, 
who attended the event, said 
that he was blown away by 
the fraternity’s efforts.
“I’m overwhelmed. I can’t 
say enough. I never expected 
anything like this, especially 
compared to last year. This is 
mind-bogglingly amazing,” 
Dax said.
Though Mich does not 
hold an of?cial leadership 
role in the fraternity, he said 
he was determined to make 
Donut Dash a major event 
on campus by “putting the 
amount of work that was re-
quired and having a desire to 
do things for the event.”
As project manager for the 
event, Mich was responsible 
for the growth of the event: 
the food trucks (Mac & Gold 
and Franktuary), the live mu-
sic from WISH 99.7, the donut 
decorating station, the com-
munity connections, and the 
corporate sponsorships, rang-
ing from People’s Natural Gas 
to The Brew Gentlemen Beer 
Company.
Cunningham said that she 
did not do much at all, but 
rather served as an adviser to 
help the men.
“It’s so rewarding to see 
that so many men are working 
together to make things hap-
pen,” Cunningham said. “You 
don’t see that delegation very 
often, but that is truly what 
fraternity is and should be: to 
give others leadership oppor-
tunities and to work together 
and to be wholly invested in 
this as a chapter event.”
“I believe that any work 
that I do, personal or aca-
demic, I try to get the most 
out of it,” Mich said. “That 
sort of started with [David] 
Kosbie’s class, when the ?-
nal project was about doing 
something real and in?uen-
tial instead of just making a 
great game. Whenever I’m 
faced with a problem, I want 
the solution to be the most 
bene?cial to me and the com-
munity. Donut Dash was the 
perfect ?t.”

der to accomplish their goals,” 
Tademy said of the winners. 
“Like Randy Pausch, they run 
through walls.”
The Outstanding Dedica-
tion Award was given to Git-
zen. The Andy Awards web-
site says of Gitzen, “Day in 
and day out, [Chuck] just gets 
the job done, no matter what 
it is. In everything he does, 
Chuck is committed to doing 
a quality job.”
The Andy Award for Out-
standing Commitment to 
Students was presented by 
Dean of Student Affairs Gina 
Casalegno.
“[The nominees] surpass 
their duties of their job de-
scription and understand 
the immediate as well as 
underlying needs of our stu-
dents” said Casalegno. “Staff 
at this institution express an 
investment in learning about 
the whole student, through 
understanding students’ val-
ues, their ambitions, their 
aspirations, and what mo-
tivates them to learn and 
contribute to the broader 
community.”
The award was given to 
Rubab Jafry O’Connor (HNZ 
‘05), an academic adviser in 
the Tepper School of Business.
Mary Ann Blair, director of 
information security, present-
ed the award for Outstanding 
Innovation.
“As individuals, teams, and 
community members, people 
in this room continually in-
vent and adapt,” Blair said.
The award was given to 
Treshea Wade (HNZ ’14), the 
sole nominee and assistant 
director of alumni relations in 
the Tepper School of Business.
“An incredibly hard work-
er, [Wade] has earned a 
reputation for her imagina-
tion, creativity and innova-
tive ideas especially related to 
online communication with 
alumni and social media” ac-
cording to the Andy Awards 
website.
The Andy Award for 
Outstanding Culture was 
awarded to Diane Stidle, the 
graduate programs manager 
in the School of Computer 
Science’s Machine Learn-
ing Department. According 
to the Andy Awards Website, 
the award for Outstanding 
Culture recognizes those who 
“foster a balanced and inclu-
sive workplace” and “bring 
out the best in each individual 
and organization.”
Vice President for Cam-
pus Affairs Michael Murphy 
presented the Andy Award 
for Outstanding University 
Citizenship.
“The Andy Award for Out-
standing University Citizen-
ship honors those who have 
made important contributions 
that bene?t the entire univer-
sity community,” Murphy said. 
“These individuals have com-
mitted their time and energy 
to working with others to im-
prove and enhance Carnegie 
Mellon as a whole.”
The Outstanding Univer-
sity Citizenship award went 
to Rudman. According to the 
Andy Awards website, “Over 
the years, the name Joe Rud-
man has been synonymous 
with caring and commit-
ment.... He makes people 
around him better than they 
would have been, and he nev-
er gives up on those in whom 
he believes.”
The last award was for 
Outstanding Community 
Contributions, and was pre-
sented by Krowitz.
“Nominees for the Andy 
Award for Outstanding Com-
munity Contributions are 
those individuals who tire-
lessly devote themselves to 
enhancing the living, learn-
ing and working experience 
of the campus community,” 
Krowitz said. “Through their 
words and actions, they go 
above and beyond every sin-
gle day in every single way.”
The award was given to 
Leon “Pete” Smith and Wil-
liam Taylor of the Leonard 
Gelfand Center for Service 
Learning and Outreach Driv-
ers Team. Smith and Taylor 
drive the buses used for edu-
cation outreach by campus 
members.
“I’m so excited; it’s won-
derful. I’m so thankful that 
they recognized what we do,” 
Taylor said. “My mother said 
if you do something, do it 
good, and that’s all I can do.”

Feinberg studies electrical interactions of heart muscles
CLAIRE GIANAKAS
Staffwriter
Heart disease is a wide-
spread af?iction that affects 
millions of people across the 
world. 
According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, over 600,000 people 
die from sudden cardiac death 
per year. Due to this over-
whelming prevalence, billions 
of dollars are spent each year 
on cardiac research.
Adam Feinberg, assistant 
professor of materials science 
and biomedical engineer-
ing at Carnegie Mellon, re-
cently received a three-year 
$750,000 grant from the 
Human Frontier Science Pro-
gram for research on cellular 
synchronization in the heart.
The research is a collabo-
ration between Feinberg and 
Peter van der Meer, a cardiol-
ogy professor at the University 
of Groningen in the Nether-
lands. The grant, which was 
speci?cally intended to fund 
international collaboration, 
will be split between the two 
researchers. 
Feinberg’s research team 
also includes John Szyman-
ski and Quentin Jallerat, bio-
medical engineering Ph.D. 
students at Carnegie Mellon 
University.
In order for the heart to 
function properly, there must 
be synchronized electrical 
signals between the heart 
muscle cells, which are called 
cardiomyocytes. 
With proper synchroniza-
tion, the heart experiences 
strong contractions, which 
result in proper blood ?ow; 
improper synchronization 
results in decreased blood 
?ow, which can be fatal.
The team will use mechan-
ical biosensors developed by 
Feinberg’s research group 
to measure the mechanical 
interactions between cardio-
myocytes and determine how 
this mechanical interaction 
affects their electrical connec-
tions. The biosensors can be 
integrated into bioengineered 
heart tissue, where they mea-
sure mechanical stress and 
strain. 
As the cells pull on each 
other, they stretch the sensors, 
which quantify how the cells 
physically interact.
“We’re trying to under-
stand how the mechanical 
connections of cardiomyo-
cytes have to be formed in 
order for the cells to form 
electrical connections,” Fein-
berg explained. “Every time 
the heart beats, the muscle 
cells contract and pull on each 
other. We want to know how 
these mechanical connections 
form the foundation for elec-
trical connections.”
Through the collabora-
tion with van der Meer, the 
research team can take mouse 
embryonic stem cells, which 
can be turned into cardiomyo-
cytes, and alter the genes that 
allow for the mechanical cou-
pling of cells.
“Van der Meer can remove 
genes that are responsible 
for the proteins that control 
the mechanical couplings 
between cells,” said Fein-
berg. “He can develop these 
stem cells where we can turn

Sweat-eating bacteria could be cure for acne
In a study presented at the 
American Society for Microbi-
ology Conference on Bene?-
cial Microbes in Washington, 
D.C., two groups of volunteers 
were asked to apply a topical 
cream on their skin. 
The experimental group’s 
cream contained ammonia-
oxidizing bacteria (AOB), 
which digest ammonia — a 
large component of sweat.
In comparison with the 
control group, the experimen-
tal group showed signi?cant 
improvements after three 
weeks. Additionally, volun-
teers who applied more of 
the bacteria experienced even 
greater improvements.
The experimental group 
did not experience any side 
effects associated with the 
treatment. AOB may be the 
solution to the Food and Drug 
Administration’s warnings of 
the rare but life-threatening 
side effects of current acne 
products, which contain active 
ingredients benzoyl peroxide 
and salicylic acid. More stud-
ies will be conducted to con-
?rm the results of AOB.

Canada opens ?rst large-scale carbon capture plant
Last Wednesday, Canada 
launched the world’s ?rst at-
tempt at a large-scale carbon 
capture and storage plant. 
Located in Estevan, Saskatch-
ewan, the Boundary Dam coal 
plant took ?ve years and $1.4 
billion to modify for the proj-
ect. As it captures its emis-
sions, most of the extracted 
carbon dioxide will be stored 
underground, while some of 
it will be piped to nearby oil 
?elds to be used for oil recov-
ery. Cenovus Energy, one of 
Canada’s largest oil and gas 
companies, has already agreed 
to purchase the recovered car-
bon. The expected annual cap-
ture of this project is estimated 
to be the equivalent of taking 
250,000 cars off the road.
Skeptics of the agreement 
have argued that the public 
should focus on alternative 
energy needs, including wind 
and solar power. 
Ultimately, the project will 
be a test to see whether reduc-
ing greenhouse gas emissions 
through the usage of capture 
technology is economical-
ly viable.

First domestic case of Ebola con?rmed in Dallas hospital
After tests were run on 
samples taken from a patient 
in Dallas’s Texas Health Pres-
byterian Hospital, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) con?rmed the 
?rst case of Ebola diagnosed in 
the U.S. It is believed that the 
patient may have contracted 
the virus while visitng rela-
tives in Liberia.
Short for Ebola hemor-
rhagic fever, Ebola is a disease 
that arises from a viral infec-
tion. Ebola is only contagious 
if the person exhibits any 
symptoms, including vomit-
ing and diarrhea. The Dallas 
patient was reported to have 
symptoms several days after 
?ying from West Africa to the 
U.S. Efforts are being made to 
monitor individuals who have 
recently been in contact with 
the patient, including a group 
of school-aged children.
While the case has brought 
about public concern, CDC Di-
rector Tom Frieden expressed 
his con?dence that the virus 
will quickly be stopped in its 
tracks.

Student discovers method to study water on Mars
Kellie Wall, a senior at 
Washington State University 
(WSU), studied the potential 
effects of water on crystal for-
mation in basalt, a dark volca-
nic rock found in much of east-
ern Washington and Oregon.
Through her collaboration 
with other researchers, Wall 
established a way to measure 
the texture of volcanic rock, 
which utilizes an index called 
“groundmass crystallinity.”
On WSU’s campus, Wall 
used an X-ray diffraction ma-
chine to analyze rock sam-
ples from the various regions 
around the world. She then 
made comparisons with volca-
nic rock observations made by 
the rover Curiosity on Mars’s 
Gale Crater, which also used 
an X-ray diffractometer.
While her results indicate 
that the samples of Mars vol-
canic rock did not erupt with 
water, Wall’s method may 
prove to be useful in the ongo-
ing search for life outside of 
Earth. 
Wall’s research has 
been published in Nature 
Communications.

New drug-delivery capsule may replace injections
On average, a patient 
would prefer taking a drug 
orally rather than receiving 
an injection. However, many 
drugs cannot be administered 
as a pill due to the pill’s poten-
tial to breakdown in the diges-
tive system.
Researchers at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technolo-
gy and Massachusetts General 
Hospital are working to solve 
that issue. 
They have designed a novel 
drug capsule, which is covered 
in a layer of tiny needles. After 
a capsule is swallowed, the 
needles are designed to attach 
to the lining of the stomach 
and inject the drug into the 
system. 
Through animal studies, 
the method has proved more 
ef?cient than typical skin in-
jections and did not result in 
adverse side effects. 
In the future, the team 
intends to ?nd additional 
techniques for enhancing the 
effectiveness of the drug-de-
livery capsule and hopes to di-
minish safety concerns about 
the needles.

Backdoors to smartphones could be dangerous
While Apple and Google 
have toughened the encryp-
tion of their smartphones, 
the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation (FBI) has been mak-
ing numerous complaints in 
response. On Thursday, FBI 
Director James B. Comey 
criticized the giant tech com-
panies for making it harder 
for law enforcement of?cials 
to access information stored 
on a device. Police say such 
searches are essential to solve 
a wide range of serious crimes, 
such as murder and terrorist 
attacks.
Unfortunately, while cre-
ating a backdoor for law en-
forcement could help the FBI 
solve more crimes, these back-
doors are not possible without 
making new vulnerabilities in 
the device.
In the meantime, law 
enforcement have publicly 
urged companies to leave such 
backdoors embedded in their 
devices.

PUGWASH COLUMNReddit photo scandal sparks debate on website self-regulation
JOSEPH ROLLINSON
Special to The Tartan
During the celebrity 
phone hacking scandal, a 
small community on Reddit 
was the main aggregator of 
stolen photographs. Many 
called for Reddit to remove 
the material and close the 
community. In response, 
Reddit released a statement 
titled “EVERY MAN IS RE-
SPONSILBLE FOR HIS OWN 
SOUL,” in which the com-
pany described itself as a 
government rather than just 
a “company running a web-
site,’’ with the distinguishing 
factor being that a govern-
ment “exercises restraint in 
the usage of its powers.” Pug-
wash decided to tackle this is-
sue by discussing whether or 
not online communities can 
self-regulate.
Reddit is an entertain-
ment and news community-
based website. Anyone can 
start a community, called a 
subreddit, which has its own 
page and followers. Subred-
dits are moderated by mem-
bers of the subreddit, rather 
than employees of Reddit. In 
other words, they are self-
regulated. Popular subred-
dits include music, pictures, 
gaming, and movies. The 
employees of Reddit do not 
remove content unless re-
quired by law to do so. This 
means that many unpleasant 
communities also call Reddit 
their home.
From the start, everyone 
at Pugwash agreed that those 
responsible for acquiring and 
sharing the celebrity photo-
graphs were in the wrong. 
They had done something 
that was not only probably 
illegal, but also ethically un-
sound. However, some ar-
gued that although online 
communities that self-regu-
late can host unpleasant com-
munities, they are also home 
to important discussions 
on issues such as the Stop

HOW THINGS WORKFridge cooling process is complex
ADITHYA VENKATESAN
Junior Staffwriter
As you grab your next 
drink or meal from that trusty 
little fridge you keep in your 
room, you might want to 
know a little more about what 
exactly is going on in there 
to make sure your food stays 
cold and fresh. 
Surprisingly, it’s a lot more 
complicated than you may 
think. For example, how do 
we get so much cold air to be 
in the fridge, without there 
being any in the fridge origi-
nally? How do we keep every-
thing so compact? To under-
stand how a fridge works, we 
should ?rst look at the cooling 
process involved.
The cooling process ne-
cessitates combining a 
few components to exploit 
the properties of different 
states of matter. According 
to howstuffworks.com, the 
fridge has a compressor or a 
pump that condenses the re-
frigerant gas, known as cool-
ant. As a result, temperature 
and pressure of the coolant 
increases. Coolant is then 
pushed onto coils that are lo-
cated outside of the refrigera-
tor. 
Here, the heat that was 
just gained from the com-
pressing process is released 
through cooling ?ns, allow-
ing the coolant to condense 
back into a liquid. The liquid 
is then funneled into an ex-
pansion valve. Essentially, the 
high-pressure liquid from the 
coils is suddenly pushed into 
a low pressure area, which 
causes the temperature of this 
area to drop signi?cantly to a 
lower temperature than in the 
fridge. Some of the refriger-
ant immediately evaporates 
while the rest expands. Con-
sequently, the temperature 
of the refrigerant absorbs the 
heat from the fridge, cooling 
the fridge’s air. It also evapo-
rates to a gas, which sucks 
heat and energy from the 
surrounding air, cooling the 
fridge even more. After its 
journey through the fridge, 
the coolant returns to the 
compressor in order to restart 
its cycle.
As you can tell, the cool-
ant plays a crucial role in the 
cooling process. But what is 
the refrigerant? The coolant 
depends on the type of refrig-
erator being considered. For 
example, most modern refrig-
erators use 1,1,1,2-tetra?uo-
roethane (HFC-134a), which 
is not toxic to humans and 
does not deplete the ozone 
layer. Before this coolant was 
used, however, ammonia 
was widely used. Ammonia, 
though useful, is extremely 
toxic to people, making leaks 
hazardous to anyone in the 
vicinity. Although they have 
been mostly phased out, many 
large industrial refrigerators 
still use ammonia. After am-
monia came chloro?uorocar-
bons (CFCs), which are non-
toxic to humans. However, 
this coolant is harmful to the 
ozone layer.
Although most refrigera-
tors have a common cooling 
process, there are a few non-
standard refrigerators such 
as gas, propane, electric, and 
even solar fridges. The gas 
and propane fridges have a 
similar cooling process to that 
of a standard refrigerator, but 
are unique in their lack of 
both moving parts and elec-
tricity. They use ammonia and 
hydrogen gas in combination 
with the heat produced by the 
burning of gas or propane in 
order to cool the contents of 
the fridge. 
As the water and ammonia 
mixture reaches the boiling 
point, it begins to follow the 
same process as the standard 
fridge, with the heat from 
the gas or propane acting as 
the electricity to power the 
compressor. 
Electric and solar fridges 
are also very similar, using 
something called the Peltier 
effect to generate a difference 
in temperature. Essentially, it 
creates a temperature differ-
ence by applying voltage be-
tween two points. The colder 
side is placed in the fridge, 
while the hotter is placed 
outside.
There are many different 
types of refrigerators, but 
they all follow a very similar 
principle for cooling.
Most standard ones use a 
refrigerant that can essential-
ly take heat from the inside 
of the fridge and push it out. 
With the constant creation of 
different types of refrigera-
tors, we’ll probably soon see a 
wider variety of ways to ful?ll 
this goal.
Online Piracy Act (SOPA), net 
neutrality, mass surveillance, 
and the Comcast and Time 
Warner Cable merger. If these 
companies did regulate, then 
important discussions may be 
censored.
Another important issue 
was the difference between 
hosting and linking content. 
Reddit does not host content; 
instead, it links to content 
hosted on other servers. We 
did not resolve whether or 
not there is a clear difference 
between hosting and link-
ing to content, although we 
did agree that those who link 
to content are not without 
blame.
Throughout the discus-
sion, we used physical analo-
gies to better understand what 
was happening. For example, 
one member described Reddit 
as being like an organization 
that opens a park in which 
anyone can do whatever they 
want. In this analogy, it would 
seem strange to blame the 
organization for what people 
do inside the park. Instead, 
it would seem logical that 
we should blame the people 
themselves.
We then moved our dis-
cussion from bad commu-
nities on Reddit to bullying 
on Twitter. One could argue 
that Reddit is quite easy to 
moderate due to the central-
ized communities. Twitter, 
on the other hand, is much 
more decentralized and thus 
impossible to moderate. Bul-
lying is rampant on Twitter. 
For example, Anita Sarkees-
ian, a feminist, was the target 
of a cyber mob who attacked 
her through social media out-
lets, including Twitter. The 
attacks, although only online, 
were incredibly painful and 
violent, and the perpetrators 
went unpunished. Sarkees-
ian is not a special case. Many 
people, not only the rich and 
famous, are cyberbullied, and 
rarely is anything done in re-
sponse. Those at the meeting 
agreed that this was a seri-
ous issue but did not have any 
suggestions on how to solve it.
The meeting ended with a 
poll where we asked whether 
or not Reddit should have re-
moved the content when they 
were asked to. A vast majority 
said that Reddit should have 
removed the content, but in-
terestingly the entire group 
agreed that Reddit should not 
have removed the content be-
fore they were asked to.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational organi-
zation that discusses the impli-
cations of science. This article 
is a summary of last week’s 
discussion on whether or not 
online communities can self-
regulate.
PUGWASH COLUMNRegulation of communities online has pros and cons
However, while scientists 
are beginning to understand 
many of the mechanisms 
behind neurons, much of 
neuroscience still remains a 
mystery. 
Nathan Urban, interim 
provost and the Dr. Frederick 
A. Schwertz distinguished 
professor of life sciences, and 
Robert Kass, professor in the 
statistics department and ma-
chine learning department, 
have recently received a Na-
tional Science Foundation 
(NSF) grant of $930,000 to 
support their statistical neu-
roscience and biological re-
search on understanding how 
neurons encode information. 
The research is part of Brain-
Hub, a neuroscience research 
initiative at Carnegie Mellon 
that brings together scientists 
from the ?elds of biology, 
cognitive psychology, com-
puter science, statistics, and 
engineering.
According to the Urban 
Lab website, the lab “work[s] 
in the areas of cell and synap-
tic physiology, computational 
neuroscience ... and on the 
understanding of mecha-
nisms of synchronous oscilla-
tions in networks of neurons.” 
The brain contains billions of 
neurons that communicate 
with each other via synapses, 
but no two neurons are the 
same. 
By studying the way that 
individual neurons react to 
stimuli, Urban Lab found that 
different neurons react to the 
same stimuli differently.
“For a long time, we didn’t 
realize the signi?cance of the 
differences between neurons. 
We thought it was just noise,” 
Urban said in a university 
press release. “But the subtle 
nuances play a crucial role in 
brain function. Understand-
ing the biology behind this 
could have a tremendous im-
pact on our understanding 
of how the brain computes 
information.”
However, Urban’s work 
alone is not enough to ex-
plain the complex processes 
involved in how our brains 
compute information. 
The NSF grant involves 
a collaboration between the 
Carnegie Mellon researchers 
and a group led by Alon Korn-
green of Bar-Ilan University in 
Israel. 
The biophysical tech-
niques developed by Korn-
green will be employed to 
create extremely comprehen-
sive computational models 
of the biological mechanisms 
responsible for neuronal 
activity. 
The two teams will com-
bine this data with the infor-
mation collected by Urban 
and Kass, which connect 
neural activity to neural 
computation. 
“Research into the bio-
physical and statistical analy-
sis of neurons has been run-
ning in parallel paths,” Kass 
said in a university press 
release. 
Fitting together the pieces 
of data collected by the in-
ternational team and the 
Carnegie Mellon research-
ers has the potential to solve 
the puzzle of the role neuron

BrainHub, which was just 
launched this summer, seeks 
to elucidate the structure and 
activity of the brain by com-
bining the efforts of various 
disciplines not just within 
Carnegie Mellon, but around 
the world. 
BrainHub’s website 
states, “Taking a global ap-
proach to understanding the 
brain, CMU, with its partners 
around the world, is uniquely 
quali?ed for tackling this sort 
of highly interdisciplinary 
research.” 
The brain consists of a 
complex network of neurons; 
it will take a network of re-
searchers around the world to 
understand it.

different genes off and back 
on in the same cell without 
killing it, so we can turn these 
mechanical adhesions on and 
off and see how that disrupts 
electrical connections.”
Feinberg also commented 
on the interdisciplinary na-
ture of the research: “Typi-
cally when a biologist or even 
a physician thinks about a 
certain disease, they don’t re-
ally think about mechanical 
forces, but these forces are 
directly tied to the way things 
work.”
Due to the combination 
of engineering and biology 
within the research, the team 
sees a variety of possible 
applications for the research.
The main application of 
the research is insight into ar-
rhythmia. 
Arrhythmia can be de?ned 
as a problem with the rate 
or rhythm of the heartbeat, 
which corresponds to electri-
cal dysfunction of the heart. 
Most arrhythmias are benign, 
yet some can be severely dam-
aging or even fatal.
“The research will give 
us more information about 
the underlying mechanisms 
of arrhythmia,” Feinberg 
explained. “It won’t address 
all cases, but it can give us 
some insight into cases where 
the mechanical coupling of 
cells underlies the arrhyth-
mia.”
The research could also po-
tentially impact the treatment 
of many diseases associated 
with arrhythmia that occur in 
the elderly. 
“If we know the cause of 
the arrhythmia, then we can 
potentially develop therapeu-
tics,” Feinberg said. “It could 
be a small molecule drug that 
we give someone to alter the 
mechanical connection be-
tween cells, or if gene therapy 
is a reality in the future, then 
we can potentially address it 
that way.”
Feinberg also mentioned 
that the research could have 
applications aside from treat-
ing arrhythmia. 
“The ability to create these 
sensors allows us to do live 
real time tracking of mechani-
cal strain and stress in these 
living tissues as they grow 
and develop,” he said. “That 
will help us try to understand 
what some of the forces in-
volved in the formation of 
different kinds of tissue struc-
ture are during embryonic 
development.”

Climate change is a hot-button 
topic, as it should be, with bitter 
divisions over its impact and impli-
cations for the future. With all the 
media buzz, it’s easy to dismiss it as 
clickbait and journalistic hyperbole. 
However, global warming is still 
an exceedingly serious issue, and 
should be treated as such.
The European Space Agency re-
leased a report just last week from 
the GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-
State Ocean Circulation Explorer), 
detailing its ?ndings on how the 
loss of ice from Western Antarctica 
between 2009 and 2012 has caused 
a dip in the gravitational ?eld in the 
region. Dips in gravity aren’t abnor-
mal, but usually those dips take place 
slowly, over thousands of years, ac-
cording to Discovery News.
While scientists do not yet know 
the direct impact such rapid changes 
in gravity will have, the fact remains: 
Climate change is now altering the 
way fundamental laws of our planet 
work, laws that have governed our 
environment for millions of years.
According to a Stanford Univer-
sity study funded by the National 
Science Foundation, climate change 
is causing unprecedented drought 
in California. Scienti?c American 
predicts that the desert climate of 
the Sahara will begin pushing north-
ward; southern Europe is already ex-
periencing intense droughts. Wheth-
er or not people want to accept 
climate change as a problem, it is.
It’s important to separate political 
ideology from scienti?c fact. There is 
no question that climate change is a 
rapidly escalating problem. To deny 
this fact is, simply put, scienti?cally 
misguided. Of course, it is easy to 
become overwhelmed by the sheer 
size of the problem, to feel lost in the 
crush of dire circumstance. 
However, people should not look 
at every newly found environmental 
crisis as another sign that the world 
is coming to an end. Instead, people 
should look at each new piece of 
information as a personal call to ac-
tion, an impetus to change the way 
we look at, and interact with, the en-
vironmental world.
Climate change continues to be serious issue

California just experienced a 
wave of progressive legislation 
signed into law last week, brie?y 
becoming a stronghold of legislative 
ef?ciency while most of the coun-
try’s governments are stuck in grid-
lock. Governor Jerry Brown has now 
signed bills into law that address 
sexual consent on college campuses, 
eliminate the “gay panic” defense in 
cases of LGBTQ hate crimes, and ban 
single-use plastic bags.
With growing discussion and de-
bate regarding sexual assault on col-
lege campuses, the “Yes Means Yes” 
law is the ?rst of its kind to be passed 
by a state, de?ning consent as “af-
?rmative, conscious, and voluntary 
agreement” and requiring colleges 
to provide sexual assault victims 
with con?dential report opportuni-
ties, counseling, and access to an 
advocate. The provision of these  
resources is tied to state funding for 
student ?nancial aid.
In addition to the passing of this 
af?rmative consent law, California 
passed a law eliminating the “gay 
panic” and “trans panic” defenses 
which have been used in court cas-
es to reduce sentences. Previously, 
these defenses have been used in as-
sault cases against gay or transgen-
der people to claim that the assail-
ant was too shocked by discovering 
the victim was transgender or gay 
to be held fully responsible for their  
actions. 
Thankfully, homophobic and 
transphobic defenses will no longer 
be accepted in California, a standard 
other states should certainly adopt.
In terms of environmental issues, 
this recent display of legislative ac-
tion has also banned the distribution 
of single-use plastic bags by grocery 
stores and pharmacies, and imple-
ments a 10-cent charge for plastic 
or compostable bags. Liquor stores 
and convenience stores will be af-
fected by this ban in one year, and 
the 10-cent charge can only be used 
by stores to cover costs associated 
with complying with this new law. 
Plastic bags are a signi?cant contrib-
utor to environmental damage, and 
this move should help curb the dev-
astating ecological impacts of their 
overuse.
While much of the country is fac-
ing a painfully unproductive legisla-
tive season, California has become 
a small beacon of hope in success-
fully passing a number of progressive 
pieces of legislation. 
We can only hope that other 
states, and our federal government, 
will take similar steps in the near  
future.

Ebola not a widespread threat to Americans
On Sept. 30, a man in Texas who 
had recently traveled to Liberia was 
diagnosed with the ?rst documented 
case of Ebola in the United States, 
heightening previous worries about 
the disease that erupted after ebola-
infected missionaries were ?own 
home from West Africa this summer.
However, in a country with a 
well-established healthcare system 
and access to basic sanitary neces-
sities, there is little need to worry 
that the appearance of the disease in 
America could become a widespread 
epidemic. 
Unlike Liberia and other West 
African nations, the United States 
has measures in place to prevent the 
rapid spread of a disease like Ebola. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), for example, can 
identify and monitor people who 
came into contact with the Texan 
to ensure that the disease does not 
spread further than already infected 
individuals.
Additionally, the disease is not 
airborne; it can only be spread 
through direct contact with bodily 
?uids from infected individuals. 
Once a person is identi?ed as having 
Ebola, it is easy for the CDC and doc-
tors to contain the patient and, effec-
tively, the disease. The disease can 
also be killed by cleaners and other 
sanitizers.
Ebola has become widespread in 
other nations because of a lack of 
similar, already-established response 
networks like the CDC and America’s 
vast hospital network, as well as lim-
ited access to sanitizing products. 
Without these resources, it is dif?-
cult for people  to treat those infected  
in a sanitary way that will not infect 
caregivers and, in turn, those they 
interact with.
While the spread of Ebola is a 
true concern in other nations with 
less developed healthcare systems, 
the spread of the disease in America 
is something that should be of rela-
tively little concern to citizens. This 
is especially true when one considers 
that the likelihood of being killed by 
food poisoning or partying too hard 
is greater than the likelihood of dy-
ing from Ebola in America, according 
to Newsweek. So don’t sweat Ebola, 
fellow Americans — at least for now.
It quietly slipped by, unnoticed, 
lost in the turmoil of the ISIS crisis 
— the 50th anniversary of President 
Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty” 
speech. Fifty years ago, Johnson ver-
bally recognized the problem of cy-
clical poverty and, in addition to giv-
ing the issue national attention, he 
started several means-tested welfare 
programs designed to turn what he 
called “taxeaters” into “taxpayers.” 
In other words, the War on Poverty 
was supposed to help people achieve 
self-sustenance, welfare programs 
would eventually be phased out, 
and prosperity would be achieved.
Since the war on poverty started, 
America has spent $22 trillion on 
means-tested welfare programs in 
constant 2012 dollars. Yet we’ve 
made minimal progress. When LBJ 
left of?ce in 1969, the poverty rate 
sat at about 13 percent; Now it’s 15 
percent.
It seems impossible that we can 
spend $22 trillion over 50 years and 
still have 15 percent of the country 
living in poverty. That’s because it 
actually is impossible. According 
to a recent Heritage Foundation re-
port, 75 percent of those deemed to 
be living in poverty have a car. Thir-
ty one percent of the impoverished 
have two cars, two-thirds have cable 
TV, more than half have video game 
systems, and 40 percent have wide-
screen LCD TVs.
When we think about poverty, 
we think about not having enough 
food to feed a family or sustain one’s 
own health. We think about home-
lessness and the kind of material 
deprivation that nobody in a coun-
try as wealthy as the United States 
should have to face. Turns out, only 
two percent of those in poverty are 
homeless, and, according to the 
Department of Agriculture, impov-
erished children and upper-middle 
class children have an identical in-
take of protein and vitamins. The 
overwhelming majority of those in 
poverty reported that they were not 
hungry for a single day during the 
prior year.
Though there are people in this 
country who do face the type of ma-
terial deprivation we associate with 
poverty, the problem isn’t as wide-
spread as we think — the 15 per-
cent ?gure is certainly misleading. 
That $22 trillion that we’ve spent 
on eradicating poverty has actually 
just bolstered the lifestyles of those 
with yearly earnings that place them 
in the impoverished income bracket.
If that’s a decision that we want 
to make, then that’s one thing, but 
such raw wealth redistribution 
seems to intuitively run counter to 
the American ethos. As LBJ origi-
nally described the War on Poverty, 
the goal was to turn “taxeaters” into 
“taxpayers.” By that measure, the 
War on Poverty has failed miserably. 
We have a nearly identical percent-
age of the country in the impover-
ished income bracket, and welfare 
spending in chained 2012 dollars is 
now 20 times what it was when LBJ 
left of?ce.
Fortunately, we already spend a 
lot of money on these means-tested 
welfare programs. Rather than gut-
ting the programs or looking for 
more funding, all we have to do to 
?x this issue is restructure the ad-
ministration of these resources. That 
way they can help people become 
self-suf?cient. There are all kinds of 
plausible ideas for welfare programs 
out there, many of which are now 
suggesting that local governments 
would be best equipped to handle 
the war on poverty, as they’re inti-
mately familiar with the problems of 
their constituents.
To re?ect this at a policy level, 
the federal government would re-
structure means-tested welfare 
spending as a state grant. States 
that opt in would be given the fed-
eral money that would have gone 
toward traditional means-tested 
welfare programs. The states would 
then experiment and see which anti-
poverty measures work best. 
Similar plans have been sug-
gested in the past, and while they 
haven’t been perfect, they still came 
close to achieving the original aims 
of the War on Poverty. In order to 
actually lift people up into true, 
self-ordained prosperity, we need to 
restructure federally appointed wel-
fare spending. Hopefully the 50th 
anniversary of the War on Poverty 
will give us cause to re?ect on the 
past and commit to positive change 
for the future.

A PERSON’S OPINION
October 6, 2014 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A9
Compiled by Kevin Zheng
The Tartan was grossed out, yet amazed by this weekend’s Donut Dash. So we asked,
Which baked good would you want a lifetime supply of?
For the last few years, Hong Kong 
has readied itself for the ongoing 
debate and protests that have raged 
through the city’s business district of 
Central.
Occupy Central, a movement 
dedicated to civil disobedience and 
organized by professors, lawyers 
and members of the clergy, was al-
ready hyped up last summer. Many 
writers and witnesses have refer-
enced the Tiananmen Massacre and 
the tragedy that unfolded during 
China’s last large civil disobedience 
occupation. However, it is important 
to note that while the possibility of 
a crackdown is not negligible, Chi-
na faces a unique set of constraints 
from the international community 
that limits its hand. Last time, China 
was in the midst of its “dark ages,” 
not the economic juggernaut it is 
today.
A sudden change in tactic on the 
part of the Hong Kong government 
reveals the new approach being 
implemented by Beijing and Hong 
Kong. A week ago, video footage 
of crackdowns on violent protest-
ers showed tear gas canisters being 
hurled into large crowds. As a Hong 
Kong resident myself, it never would 
have crossed my mind that extreme 
political unrest reminiscent of the 
Arab Spring was occurring in Hong 
Kong.
It is important for people to know 
about the events unfolding in Hong 
Kong, a city that has long served as 
the bridge from Eastern to Western 
worlds. While the bulk of China’s 
population lives below or on the 
poverty line, Hong Kong’s citizens 
enjoy a much higher standard of life, 
equal to that of the United Kingdom 
or Iceland. 
Additionally, the future of the 
small territory offers valuable in-
sight into the future of China. The 
way in which China reacts in the 
coming weeks, apart from its expect-
ed condemnation of the protests, 
will give hints of China’s long term 
political future. 
As a student from Hong Kong, 
I am often asked what Hong Kong 
actually is. Is it an independent city-
state like Singapore? I always reply 
with “it’s part of China, but Hong 
Kong keeps a separate government.”
This is of?cially called the one-
country, two-systems government 
as outlined in the Basic Law, the de 
facto constitution of Hong Kong. 
The Basic Law was written when 
Hong Kong transitioned from British 
colony to reclaimed special adminis-
trative region of China. As a result 
of this history, Hong Kong was once 
a prized possession of both Britain 
and China. It served as the gateway 
for the Chinese to sell their goods 
and for the British to gain access to 
the lucrative, emergent markets in 
China. However, the rise of Shang-
hai as China’s own ?nancial hub in 
the last decade or so has dimmed 
Hong Kong’s importance. While 
Hong Kong remains a major city that 
many corporations focus their oper-
ations on, it is not as indispensable 
as it used to be.
The Basic Law also guaranteed 
Hong Kong a large amount of au-
tonomy in affairs not concerned 
with national defense or foreign di-
plomacy. This autonomy formerly 
meant that Hong Kong would be 
able to hold its own elections in 
2017. Each citizen would receive 
one vote, and candidates would be 
nominated from Hong Kong by the 
Hong Kong people. This was the vi-
sion many Hong Kong citizens had 
harbored. However, the Chinese 
government disagrees, and released 
a statement over the summer say-
ing it would only allow Hong Kong 
elections under the condition that 
the candidates be approved by the 
mainland. Clearly, “universal suf-
frage” isn’t very universal in the Chi-
nese government’s vision.
Hong Kong has prized itself on 
being Asia’s “World City.” Although 
competition may have diminished 
the city in terms of economic might, 
it remains a pearl that has been long 
prized by both Eastern and West-
ern cultures. As a result, it prides 
itself on being Asia’s best place to 
live, work, or do business. It has ac-
complished this all under the one-
country, two-systems rule. Many 
people recognize this and are proud 
of this fact, and consequently, eco-
nomic progress for them also means 
political progress — speci?cally, 
democratization.
Many critics in Hong Kong and 
China point out that Hong Kong al-
ready enjoys a high degree of auton-
omy and should not be complaining. 
But changes in China’s hierarchy, 
as well as their plan to “allow” uni-
versal suffrage point to the fact that 
Hong Kong may be going backward 
in terms of political organization. 
Xi Jinping, China’s new presi-
dent, has been shown to be a strong, 
decisive leader and is very much fo-
cused on a consolidated, executive 
of?ce in China. His quick movement 
to dismantle the corrupted elite of-
?ces in China, as demonstrated by 
the capture of Zhou Yongkang over 
the summer, paints a picture of a 
powerful and determined leader. 
Recognizing this, the people of 
Hong Kong fear that the elements 
that made Hong Kong so dynamic 
may soon disappear, especially as 
China tightens its grip around the 
city. 
Going forward may be a tall or-
der, but in the eyes of Hong Kong 
citizens, the Umbrella Revolution is 
the only thing stopping them from 
sliding back down.

How often do you ?nd yourself 
asking for a plastic bag at Entropy+? 
Does the fee of a few cents change 
your mind about using plastic bags? 
Taxes need to hit a certain pain level 
to actually change behavior and since 
taxes do not always call for immediate 
action, statewide bans on plastic bags 
may be necessary. Last week, Califor-
nia became the ?rst state to ban plas-
tic bags  of?cially — a model for other 
states.
Over the past few years, a hand-
ful of local and city governments 
have been successful in implement-
ing a plastic bag tax or even a ban on 
plastic shopping bags altogether. San 
Francisco was the ?rst major city to 
ban plastic bags in 2007. 
This ban led other local govern-
ments to follow its model. Seattle, 
for example, prohibits retail stores 
from providing customers with sin-
gle-use plastic carry-out shopping 
bags. Retail stores are allowed to 
provide any size recyclable paper or 
reusable bags, but they must charge 
5 cents for paper carry-out bags of a 
large enough size.
Increasingly, more local govern-
ments have been following these 
examples, but there has not been a 
statewide ban on plastic bags until 
now. The California ban will go into 
effect from 2015 through 2016. This 
statewide ban should be a powerful 
way to push people to use fewer plas-
tic bags and encourage them to use 
reusable ones.
Environmental activists have 
pushed for plastic bag bans for years, 
as these bags create mountains of 
trash that are dif?cult to recycle. In 
addition, plastic bag manufactur-
ers use energy and nonrenewable 
resources like oil. The use of plastic 
bags isn’t the only problem; their cre-
ation also harms the environment.
However, it has been dif?cult to 
pass a statewide ban because plastic 
bags are cheaper for businesses to 
use than paper bags. According to 
Cathy Browne, a general manager 
at a California plastic bag manufac-
turer, the banning of plastic bags will 
lead to layoffs in companies such as 
hers. 
In response, Democratic Califor-
nia governor Jerry Brown stated that 
the ban will be “closing the loop on 
the plastic waste stream, all while 
maintaining — and growing — Cali-
fornia jobs.”
Even within the community of en-
vironmentalists, there are disagree-
ments on the ban of plastic bags. 
There are people who oppose ban-
ning plastic bags and suggest that a 
tax is the better alternative. 
One of the main arguments 
against the ban is that plastic bags 
are very low in priority when all en-
vironmental issues are considered. 
Nevertheless, encouraging small, 
environmentally positive changes 
is a step. It may or may not make a 
giant impact right away, but it is, in 
fact, a step.
For those cities that do not have 
plastic bag bans, it is not dif?cult to 
make the more environmentally-

Microsoft has always been a risk 
taker with its products, often releasing 
them to the market before they have 
been properly readied.
We have seen this time and time 
again with Windows Vista, the Sur-
face line of products, and most re-
cent prominent instance, Windows 
8. After the Windows Vista disaster, 
Windows 7 came in to save the day. 
After several iterations of its Surface 
tablet, the new 12-inch Surface ar-
rived as the product that Microsoft 
should have been producing all 
along. Windows 10 answers the com-
plaints about Windows 8, an operat-
ing system that could not even man-
age to achieve a 15 percent adoption 
rate among Windows users.
As the market moved toward 
mobile devices, Microsoft became 
well aware that it needed to become 
more touchscreen friendly or die. 
However, releasing Windows 8 as 
a response to this trend was much 
too radical, plaguing mouse and 
keyboard users with large tiles and 
hidden menus that were clearly not 
optimal for their peripherals.
However, with Windows 10, Mi-
crosoft may have ?nally hit the nail on 
the head with its dream of “One Prod-
uct Family, One Platform, and One 
Store.” They appear to have ?nally 
created an operating system that tai-
lors to touchscreen users, while not 
throwing desktop users aside.
First and foremost, they have 
restored the coveted Start Menu. 
Nearly 20 years after its creation, it 
is ?nally making its return and, with 
it, Microsoft is ?nally doing what it 
should have done all along. Instead 
of plaguing desktop users with a gi-
ant fullscreen view of their tiles, a 
much more user-friendly start menu 
— complete with a resizable dy-
namic tile menu — greets new and 
returning Windows users.
For desktop users, full-screen 
“modern” apps can now be run in re-
sizable windows, along with legacy 
Windows 7 applications. Microsoft 
has not forgotten about the desk-
top, and the company is now adding 
loads of features, including a smart-
er snap and an updated command 
prompt and desktop search.
However, Microsoft has equally 
considered touchscreen users. For 
devices without physical keyboards, 
users will still be greeted by a mod-
ern user interface (UI), optimized 
for touchscreen. More impressively, 
when they attach to a keyboard with 
the new “continuum” feature, the 
desktop — along with more mouse- 
and keyboard-friendly UI features — 
will take the screen.
With Windows 10, Microsoft 
will also add universal apps to the 
Windows Store, which will run 
on all Windows 10 devices, every-
thing from mobile to computer to 
television-connected media devices.
While its implementation was 
overly radical, Windows 8 and simi-
lar progressive ideas will help Mi-
crosoft continue to generate in order 
to remain prominent in the market. 
However, while progressive ideas 
are imperative, Microsoft must make 
sure that it is not too radical in imple-
mentation. Windows 10 should be a 
major improvement to Windows 8, 
restoring functionality to traditional 
users, while continuing to bring 
touchscreen and mobile users into 
the future.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Staffwriter
At the beginning of the 
semester, I predicted that 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
would signi?cantly improve 
from their under .500 record 
last season and that the New 
Orleans Saints had a chance 
at becoming Super Bowl 
winners. 
After one quarter of the 
2014 NFL season, the jury is 
still out, but these two teams 
have faltered enough to lose 
their spots. Here is a break-
down of what went wrong and 
who takes their places:
Tampa Bay Buccaneers
The Buccaneers’ struggles 
are not particularly hard to 
explain. Quarterback Josh 
McCown has been less “per-
fect stopgap” than just bad. 
Tampa ?gured that much of 
McCown’s success in Chicago 
last season could be attributed 
to a receiving corps that tow-
ered over opponents, giving 
him throwing lanes over most 
NFL cornerbacks. 
The Bucs replicated that 
group with wide receivers 
Vincent Jackson and Mike 
Evans. Neither of these play-
ers has lacked for production 
this year; the offense’s strug-
gles fall largely on McCown’s 
shoulders. 
Chicago Bears head coach 
Marc Trestman installed a 
very successful offensive sys-
tem that got a performance 
from McCown unlike any 
previously seen in his lengthy 
NFL career. With the Bucs, 
McCown went back to being 
a replacement-level backup, 
throwing interceptions on six 
percent of his passes, double 
the NFL average this season. 
He even managed to fumble 
and throw an interception on 
the same play.
Unfortunately, a thumb in-
jury ended McCown’s season 
earlier than head coach Lovie 
Smith could during week 
three. Backup Mike Glennon 
has been better, but there are 
problems besides McCown.
The defense has been ter-
rible. The league might have 
passed Smith by. The cover 
two defense he employs looks 
unimaginative, and quarter-
backs are thwarting it with 
ease. Even with defensive 
tackle Gerald McCoy and de-
fensive end Michael Johnson 
missing time, the performance 
is inexcusable. 
Safety Dashon Goldson 
and cornerback Alterraun 
Verner have both been huge 
disappointments after mul-
tiple successful years. Weak-
side linebacker Lavonte David 
has been pedestrian, a far cry 
from his planet-eating peak 
last season. 
Teams are passing on the 
Bucs with ease and then run-
ning through empty boxes 
as the defense adjusts. This 
team’s strength from last year 
— the unit that dragged it 
to the lofty ranks of 4–12 — 
looks like it might be a disaster 
heading into the year.
Even so, there is cause for 
hope. The Bucs should have 
won week two, when a 10-sec-
ond runoff stemming from 
a player’s injury prevented 
them from attempting a game-
winning ?eld goal. 
However, Glennon is only a 
slight upgrade over McCown, 
and Smith’s scheme looks 
aged out. The Bucs were thor-
oughly outplayed in a week 
four victory, and this team is 
bad.
Dallas Cowboys
The Cowboys should take 
this spot. As an 8–8 team last 
season with a salary cap deba-
cle, no one expected the Cow-
boys to be good this year. 
The team was punchless 
except for a strong passing of-
fense, and quarterback Tony 
Romo had sustained another 
serious back injury. They had 
nothing left.
The improvement started 
on the offensive side of the 
ball. The Cowboys’ biggest 
problem last year was game 
management. Romo was 
forced to pass down?eld with 
huge leads. This led to shoddy 
route running by a team that 
had taken its foot off the gas 
pedal, and these broken routes 
led to late-game interceptions.
This year, the Cowboys 
have ?nally discovered that 
they are allowed to run the 
ball. The team has a great 
offensive line, and running 
back DeMarco Murray has im-
proved massively every year. 
He is football’s best running 
back through four weeks, and 
it isn’t particularly close. This 
performance is allowing the 
Cowboys to keep their defense 
off the ?eld, retain leads, and 
play winning football. 
Even though Romo’s back 
injury has turned him from 
a great passer into an erratic 
mess, that is mitigated by the 
overhaul in play calls. 
In a game where running 
the ball is usually a bad idea, 
the Cowboys are constructed 
in a way that it is bene?cial, 
and they ?nally noticed.
The defense has somehow 
been passable as well, with 
castoffs like middle linebacker 
Rolando McClain and defen-
sive tackle Henry Melton per-
forming admirably. Through 
four weeks, the team ranks 
slightly below average by 
Football Outsider’s Defensive 
Value Over Average (DVOA) 
and outside of the emergence 
of cornerback Orlando Scan-
drick, there is not really much 
of note. After last year’s de-
fensive horror show, slightly 
below average and nothing of 
note is much better. 
The combination of that 
and a humming offense has 
the Cowboys sitting pretty at 
3–1 and in a position to maybe 
break their seemingly endless 
streak of 8–8 seasons.
New Orleans Saints
The New Orleans Saints 
have gotten off to an awful 
1–3 start. After the team had 
a great offense and pass de-
fense last year, it seemed like 
they would return that combi-
nation and free safety Jairus 
Byrd would be an improve-
ment over Roman Harper, 
a human manifestation of 
blown coverages.
The offense has been play-
ing well. Its numbers are 
de?ated by a series of rush-
ing teams shortening games 
against the Saints, but they’re 
putting huge numbers on the 
board week after week any-
way. Offenses also tend to play 
worse when behind, as risks 
necessary for comebacks lead 
to turnovers.
The defense, on the other 
hand, has been horrible. Out-
side linebacker Junior Galette 
and defensive end Cameron 
Jordan have not been the ter-
rifying duo many expected. 
Furthermore, the sixth-ranked 
pass defense from last season 
has blown coverage after cov-
erage in the secondary.
It starts with Byrd. It seems 
like former Bills defensive co-
ordinator knew how to maxi-
mize Byrd’s skills in Buffalo, 
as Byrd has looked completely 
lost in Rob Ryan’s system in 
New Orleans. He is consis-
tently blowing coverages and 
wandering aimlessly through 
the defensive back?eld. Fur-
ther, he has now been placed 
on injured reserve with a torn 
lateral meniscus ligament. 
Across from corner Keenan 
Lewis, the other corner slots 
have been a nightmare, with 
number two receivers wreak-
ing havoc on the hapless duo 
of Corey White and Patrick 
Robinson. The Saints have 
glaring holes, and they’re eas-
ily exploitable. 
That doesn’t cut it for 
a team once named a title 
contender.
Cincinnati Bengals
The team initially slated 
to take the Saints’ spot in the 
contenders column during my 
initial predictions, however, 
was the Cincinnati Bengals. 
They’re 3–0 with the bye af-
ter four weeks, and they’ve 
looked incredible. 
The team is largely the 
same as last year’s successful 
team, with a very stout pass 
rush and solid secondary, but 
there are three key changes.
First, cornerback Leon 
Hall’s return has made the 
secondary terrifying. He has 
snuffed out passing plays and 
dominated great passing of-
fenses like the Atlanta Falcons 
and the Baltimore Ravens. 
Second, running back Gio Ber-
nard is a true star. He’s been 
unstoppable over the Bengals’ 
three games in both receiving 
and running. Third, quarter-
back Andy Dalton is respond-
ing to his contract extension in 
the best possible way. He was 
actually a good quarterback 
when not under pressure, 
but he turned into a quiver-
ing mess when the rush broke 
through, despite Cincy’s excel-
lent offensive line.
This season? He’s actu-
ally been pretty solid beating 
the rush. Bernard has thrust 
him into a caretaker role, but 
Dalton is improving the team 
rather than hurting it this sea-
son. That could be huge going 
forward. 
If they keep this up, ex-
pect a more in-depth break-
down of the NFL’s fourth true 
contender.
After Sunday’s early after-
noon games, nothing much 
changed.
The Saints and Buccaneers 
played each other, putting on 
a sloppy performance plagued 
by turnovers, drops, and lazy 
defense.  The ?nal score saw 
New Orleans win in overtime 
after running back Khiry Rob-
inson ran for a touchdown.
New Orleans Saints quar-
terback Drew Brees was un-
characteristically inconsistent 
when trying to push the ball.  
He threw three interceptions, 
including one on a poten-
tially game-winning drive 
for New Orleans to close out 
regulation.
Mike Glennon played about 
as well as Brees, which is way 
more than the Bucs could have 
hoped for, but neither played a 
particularly good game.
Both defenses faltered, as 
the scoreboard was spinning 
for most of the game.
The Cowboys pulled out an 
overtime win over the Hous-
ton Texans, leaning on De-
Marco Murray for 136 yards.  
Romo improved on his previ-
ously erratic performances 
and completed close to 70 per-
cent of his passes, including 
touchdowns to wide receiv-
ers Dez Bryant and Terrence 
Williams.
The Bengals played later in  
the day against the New Eng-
land Patriots.
NFL preseason predictions: the quarter season review
“[DeMarco Murray] is football’s 
best running back through four 
weeks and it isn’t particularly 
close.  This performance is 
allowing the Cowboys to keep 
their defense off the ?eld, retain 
leads, and play winning football.”
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team started 
their University Athletic As-
sociation (UAA) schedule on 
Saturday when they traveled 
to Chicago to face off against 
the University of Chicago Ma-
roons. The two teams each 
came into the game with six 
wins and looked even.
The play on the ?eld con-
?rmed that, as the two sides 
tied 0–0 after 20 minutes 
of extra play. Even the box 
scores looked even, with each 
team tallying nine shots.
The heated contest result-
ed in multiple fouls for both 
team, 20 for the Tartans and 
12 for the Maroons, plus sev-
eral yellow cards. After only 
one card in the ?rst half, be-
longing to Chicago, the teams 
combined for four yellows 
in the second half and three 
more in overtime. The cards 
were not just limited to play-
ers, as the entire Carnegie 
Mellon team received a yel-
low in the 70th minute.
Senior goalkeeper Jacob 
Rice recorded his ?rst shutout 
of the season. Rice and the 
Tartans play next on Saturday 
at home against Washington 
in their second UAA match.
Women’s Soccer
The No. 4-ranked Carn-
egie Mellon women’s soccer 
team continued their unde-
feated season as they traveled 
to No. 12-ranked University of 
Chicago to open UAA play.  
     Sophomore forward Megan 
Bartoshuk opened up a lead 
early with a goal, her second 
of the season. Bartoshuk’s 
goal in the 11th minute came 
off of a cross to the six yard 
box by senior forward Savina 
Reid.
Discontent with only a 
1–0 lead, the Tartans quickly 
scored again in the 22nd 
minute with ?rst-year Keely 
Jelinek’s ?rst goal of the sea-
son. This time the goal was 
set up off of a corner kick by 
senior Lauren Simicich.
After playing defensively 
for the rest of the match, the 
Maroons ?nally got on the 
board with a goal in the 83rd 
minute. However, this was 
too little too late, as Carnegie 
Mellon won 2–1.
The Tartans will to push 
to 10–0–0 on Saturday when 
they host the No. 1-ranked 
University of St. Louis.
Volleyball
Traveling to Atlanta, the 
Carnegie Mellon volleyball 
team opened UAA play with 
their ?rst round robin match, 
facing off against Roches-
ter, Case Western, and host 
Emory over the course of the 
weekend.
In their ?rst Saturday 
match, the Tartans played 
Rochester and quickly dis-
posed of their foe, winning 
easily in straight sets. Roches-
ter kept the ?rst set competi-
tive, 25–20, before falling off 
and losing the last two 25–13 
and 25–9.
Senior right setter Ali 
Celentano and ?rst-year mid-
dle blocker Eliza Donohue 
led the team with seven kills 
apiece, while sophomore de-
fensive setter Molly Higgins 
had a team high 13 digs. 
In the second match of the 
afternoon, Carnegie Mellon 
faced off against rival Case 
Western. This match was a bit 
tougher for the Tartans, but 
they ultimately prevailed 3–1.
After losing the ?rst two 
sets 25–19 and 25–21, Case 
Western battled back and took 
the third set 25–21 before the 
Tartans squashed any hopes 
of a comeback with a 25–13 
fourth set victory. Celentano 
again led the team in with 18 
kills, along with sophomore 
middle blocker Jackie Gib-
bons and ?rst-year outside 
hitter Heather Holton, who 
scored 16 and 13 kills, respec-
tively. This gave them three 
Tartans with double-digit 
kills. Higgins again played 
great defense, recording 22 
digs, while sophomore setter 
and outside opposite Emily 
Newton had a match high 37 
assists.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
played host Emory. Carnegie 
Mellon came out strong and 
took the ?rst two sets 27–25 
and 25–19 before dropping 
three straight sets for their 
?rst loss of the weekend, 
18–25, 16–25, 4–15. Celen-
tano and Holton led the team 
with kills in the loss with 12 
and 11, respectively, while 
Higgins and sophomore Ivana 
Vlahovic led the team in digs 
with 14 and 10, respectively.
The Tartans next play at 
the Ithaca Tournament on Fri-
day and Saturday.

The Carnegie Mellon foot-
ball team wrapped up an un-
defeated home stand against 
Westminster on Saturday to 
pull their record for the season 
to an even 2–2. After a slow of-
fensive start, Carnegie Mellon 
rode a solid performance by 
their defense and Westminster 
mistakes to an exciting 27–24 
win.
The ?rst half opened with 
traded punts, and neither team 
was able to establish much of a 
start offensively. On Westmin-
ster’s second offensive drive, 
junior outside linebacker Nico 
Comsa jumped a route near 
the Carnegie Mellon sideline 
and returned an interception 
24 yards for a touchdown, set-
ting the tone for a very good 
defensive half for Carnegie 
Mellon. Westminster had one 
threatening drive in the ?rst 
half, but senior defensive 
tackle Johnathan Tanner burst 
into the back?eld and stripped 
the ball, recovering the fumble 
and ending Westminster’s pos-
session at Carnegie Mellon’s 
four-yard line. Outside of that 
drive, Westminster managed 
less than 90 yards of offense in 
the entire half. Due to both the 
swarming defense from Carn-
egie Mellon and a missed 45-
yard ?eld goal, Westminster 
was unable to get more than a 
?eld goal on the board in the 
?rst half. The Carnegie Mellon 
offense had trouble moving 
the ball as well, and the defen-
sive score accounted for their 
lone points of the ?rst half.
The second half went much 
differently. Westminster’s ?rst 
drive of the half went 78 yards 
for a touchdown. The ensu-
ing extra point attempt failed, 
but still gave Westminster a 
9–7 lead that they would keep 
until Carnegie Mellon pulled 
ahead on a ?eld goal several 
minutes later.
The game sped up from 
that point. Westminster scored 
a touchdown on a pass to the 
corner of the endzone that 
split the Carnegie Mellon sec-
ondary. For the two-point con-
version attempt, Westminster 
lined up their offensive line all 
the way on the left side of the 
?eld, but the throw came over 
the middle and put Carnegie 
Mellon in a seven-point hole 
with 3:40 left in the third. 
Carnegie Mellon answered 
with a great kick return by 
?rst-year running back Sam 
Benger, setting Carnegie Mel-
lon up at the Westminster 
21. Sophomore running back 
Zach Cree carried the ball 
across the goal line to capital-
ize on the excellent ?eld posi-
tion and tied the game at 17.
After a series of traded 
punts, Westminster broke the 
deadlock with just over ?ve 
minutes left in the contest 
with a touchdown pass. Carn-
egie Mellon answered by go-
ing to the hurry-up offense, 
but the drive stalled on the 
Westminster 36-yard line af-
ter a turnover on downs. The 
defense remained stout, how-
ever, and forced Westminster 
into a three-and-out on the 
following drive, getting Carn-
egie Mellon the ball back with 
just under three minutes left 
on the clock.
Hearon completed three 
consecutive passes and scram-
bled to set Carnegie Mellon 
up on the Westminster 25-
yard line, where he delivered 
a strike to ?rst-year wide re-
ceiver John Prather in the 
endzone. The pass was bro-
ken up by a blatant defensive 
pass interference penalty, set-
ting up Carnegie Mellon with 
the ball on the one yard-line. 
Hearon then completed the 
touchdown pass to senior tight 
end Hayden Cardiff. The extra 
point was good, and the game 
was tied at 21 with 43 seconds 
remaining.
Westminster’s attempt at a 
game-winning drive got off to 
a quick start with two straight 
completed passes going out of 
bounds and setting up West-
minster at their own 41-yard 
line, not too far off from ?eld 
goal range. The third pass, 
however, ?oated through the 
air and landed directly in the 
hands of junior cornerback 
Ryan Aitken, setting up Carne-
gie Mellon with excellent ?eld 
position but only 19 seconds 
to try and push the ball for a 
game-winning score.
Carnegie Mellon’s game-
winning drive did not start 
well. A dropped pass, a short 
run, and a sack set Carnegie 
Mellon up with one second 
left on the clock. The hail 
mary pass was foiled when 
Westminster got into the back-
?eld and took down Hearon 
for a sack to force overtime, 
but a facemask penalty gave 
Carnegie Mellon 15 yards and 
one untimed down to ?nish 
the game. After initially send-
ing the offense onto the ?eld, 
?rst-year kicker Tyler Kohman 
came out to attempt a 50-yard 
?eld goal to give Carnegie 
Mellon the win.
The kick cut through the 
wind and rain to bounce off 
the cross bar and through, giv-
ing Carnegie Mellon a 27–24 
win.
The kick came on the heels 
of Kohman winning the Presi-
dent’s Athletic Association 
Special Teams Player of the 
Week for his excellent punting 
against Geneva College.
The ?eld goal was the lon-
gest in Carnegie Mellon 
history.
After winning two nail bit-
ers at home, Carnegie Mellon 
football will attempt to keep 
the momentum going when 
it travels to West Virginia to 
face Bethany College next 
Saturday.

Men’s and women’s tennis win all three weekend matches

Senior Staffwriter
This weekend, the Carne-
gie Mellon men’s and women’s 
tennis teams both played at 
home at the indoor facility in 
Monroeville.
On Friday, the women’s 
team took on Oberlin College 
as it returned to the duel for-
mat after last playing in an in-
dividual format. 
The Tartans quickly opened 
up a 3–0 lead in the doubles 
competition with the pairings 
of sophomore Vanessa Pavia 
and ?rst-year Katie Lai, along 
with ?rst-years Stacy Chang 
and Cori Sidell both winning 
their matches 8–2. 
Seniors Bryn Raschke and 
Angela Pratt had a bit more 
trouble in the ?rst doubles 
spot, needing to go to the tie-
breaker before ?nally winning 
9–8(7–3).
Carnegie Mellon kept roll-
ing in singles play, going a 
combined 5–1 with sopho-
more Nicholle Torres, ?rst-
year Kalyani Narayan, Chang, 
and Sidell all winning in 
straight sets. 
Chang and Sidell were par-
ticularly impressive, they each 
only dropped one point each 
set as they both won 6–1, 6–1.
This marked the end of the 
season for the Tartans, who 
will compete next in February.
The men’s team played 
host to Oberlin and Ohio Wes-
leyan on Saturday. 
In the afternoon against 
Wesleyan, the Tartans came 
out strong, sweeping the dou-
bles play. 
Senior Bryce Beisswanger 
and junior Yuvraj Kumar won 
8–1 in the number one spot 
while senior Will Duncan and 
sophomore Jack Kasbeer, 
along with sophomores Kunal 
Wadwani and Kenny Zheng, 
won easily, 8–2 and 8–3, 
respectively.
The Tartans kept the good 
times going in the singles 
matches, with all six men tak-
ing their matches in straight 
sets. Junior Abishek Alla and 
?rst-year Tommy Cheng, were 
the most dominant, each win-
ning their sets 6–1, 6–1.
At night, Carnegie Mellon 
hosted Oberlin and kept the 
same momentum from earlier, 
sweeping both doubles and 
singles again. 
Sophomore Kiril Kirkov 
and Wadwani won their 
match 8–3, while Beisswanger 
and Kumar struggled a bit 
more, ?nishing 7–4. Kasbeer 
and Duncan needed the tie-
breaker 9–7.
In singles, while it was still 
a straight sweep, it took a bit 
more effort; multiple play-
ers needed tiebreakers to win 
their matches.
Alla and Cheng again won 
in straight sets, and were 
matched in that feat by Zheng, 
who had the best play, win-
ning 6–2, 6–0.
Carnegie Mellon will com-
pete next on Sunday when 
they host Amherst.

A deliciously delectable dessert
This recipe will make sure you always go out with a bang
The idea of dessert is billed as an afterthought 
— “oh and by the way here’s some cake” — and 
actually is anything but. It’s impressive to make an 
elaborate dinner, don’t get me wrong. But the true 
measure of becoming a chef, a true cook, worthy of 
the jealousy of your peers and the envy of your exes, 
is literally being able to put the icing on the cake 
and serve them a dessert.
By this time in our lives, no longer are chocolate 
chips and brownies considered to be the measure 
of success. Instead we turn to other desserts, more 
sophisticated, more complicated, more daring. We 
turn to soufflés.
Chocolate Caramel Soufflé
This is the kind of recipe that you only stumble 
upon every few years. The kind that redefines 
what decadence means to you. The kind that will 
make you realize that you are, without a doubt, the 
classiest, most talented chef in this kitchen. It’s rich, 
it’s smooth, and it’s damn impressive. Have at it.
1/3 cup of sugar, plus at least another 1/4 cup for 
sprinkling
1 tablespoon of butter, melted
1/2 cup of chocolate (this can be fancy, expensive 
European chocolate or plain old Nestlé chips)
3 egg yolks
6 egg whites (I know, I know, extra egg yolks)
Caramel sauce
Note: To really and truly make soufflés, you must 
have ramekins (four to six). These are tiny, ceramic 
dishes that will yield the most beautiful, airy soufflés 
you have ever seen. You owe it to yourself to have a 
set anyway, so just suck it up and buy some.
1) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
 
2) Time to coat the ramekins: Swab them with 
butter, then put some sugar inside of them and 
shake them around to cover them entirely in both 
butter and sugar. I know it seems stupid, but 
actually, it’s not. The mix will guarantee that the 
soufflés rise evenly and smoothly, thus creating 
perfect soufflés.
3) Melt your chocolate. Do not do this by sticking 
it in a microwave. Instead, try a double boiler 
technique: Start by boiling some water in a pan. Put 
the chocolate into a glass bowl, then hold the bowl 
above the boiling water until the chocolate starts to 
melt. From there, stir until the chocolate is liquidy 
and smooth.
4) Remove the chocolate from the heat and then stir 
in the egg yolks. Set aside.
5) Beat the egg whites in a mixer until they start to 
form peaks (a fancy way of saying that their texture 
starts to change). This will literally feel like it is 
taking forever. Just stay calm. Start adding the 1/3 
cup of sugar slowly, a little bit at a time, until stiff 
peaks are formed. This will look like meringue. 
6) Pour the chocolate mixture slowly into the egg 
whites. Fold it in gently. 
7) Distribute the mixture among the ramekins. 
Before you bake them, run your finger over the edge. 
They’ll rise better if you smooth out the top.
 
8) Bake them for about 25 minutes, or until they’ve 
risen but are still wiggly in the center.
9) Let them cool, then take a spoon and carve a little 
out of the center. Pour some caramel sauce into the 
center and then put the cap back on. 
10) Consume, then die of self-appreciation.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
One of my best friends 
plays Chaser on the 
university’s Quidditch 
team, but only because 
she didn’t make Snitch 
last year. She’s been 
training nonstop — 
literally every day since 
then, she’s been painting 
herself gold and running 
laps around the football 
field in her underwear 
— tryouts are next week 
so she’s been having me 
time her laps and pelt her 
with dodge balls — does 
the Snitch even get pelted 
during real games?
But she’s not going to 
get the position — she 
runs like a wounded 
hippogriff, and I can’t 
count on two hands and 
feet the number of times 
I’ve scored headshots. 
How do I let her down 
slow and make sure she 
doesn’t go about the 
same training regimen (or 
worse) this year?
Miserably,
Mostly Offish and 
Reclusive, Except 
Obliging Friends and 
Associates, Regretting 
Ever Disclosing Will to 
Assist Lucy with Life’s 
Fierce Aspiration to run 
Naked
Dear MORE OF A 
REDWALL FAN,
Oh, you won’t be able to 
do both. Let her down slow 
and discourage her from 
trying again, I mean. From 
personal experience, avid (a 
mild adjective, considering 
their vehemence) Harry 
Potter fans, particularly 
those who go so far as to 
act out events from the 
books, like Quidditch players 
or LARPing cosplayers, 
have tendencies toward the 
stubborn and the dramatic.
If you value your time and 
sanity, I’d skip going easy 
on her and jump straight to 
telling her flat-out that she’s 
slow as balls and that she 
should stick to spending 
Saturdays failing to solve 
New York Times crosswords.
RIP Brian Jacques 
(pronounced “Jakes,” 
apparently),
Evan Kahn
 
Dear Evan,
I always leave my dishes 
in the sink to do later, 
but then I forget to wash 
them, so my roommates 
get mad at me. But I 
really don’t want to do the 
dishes. Help?
Lazily yours,
Sometimes Consume 
Unpretentious Meals But, 
Under Constraints, Kip 
Ere Tidying
Dear SCUM BUCKET,
Just make it look like you’ve 
washed your plates and 
water glasses. Silverware is 
easy — just swipe your fork 
with a soapy sponge once, 
and you’re fine. The trick is 
to put in absolutely no effort.
I hope my roommates 
don’t think I do this…

Seven Guitars sounds like a painfully literal band name, 
but in this context it’s the School of Drama’s ?rst main-
stage production of the season.
Seven Guitars is a relevant and hyperlocal choice for 
this audience: It’s written by Pittsburgh-born playwright 
August Wilson and takes place in the Hill District circa 
1948. The crew wastes no opportunity in capitalizing on 
the setting: The exceptional scenic design is fastidiously 
detailed, as School of Drama patrons have grown 
accustomed to seeing.
According to the program, the setting is “the backyard 
of 1727 Bedford Avenue,” but the scenic design crew 
ran wild with this barebones description. The setup is 
distinctly 3-D, featuring small, convincingly textured 
brick apartment buildings jutting out onto the stage. 
An herb garden packed with soil stretches toward 
the audience, and moss grows in the breaks between 
squares of concrete. A clothesline dips between 
buildings — sheer garments hanging by clothespins 
— illuminated from behind by the suggestion of a 
perpetually glowing distant sun.
As a caveat, the production is exceptionally long: 
Including the intermission, the performance clocks in 
at nearly three hours. If you’re viewing an 8 p.m. show, 
don’t count on being anywhere else until 11 p.m. or later.
In that respect, the producers might have done more to 
condense the play into a stage-suitable production. The 
scenes are not extraordinary in number, but they are 
long, featuring interchanges of rambling and seemingly 
trivial dialogue between characters. Seven Guitars 
is considered to be August Wilson’s ultimate artistic 
catharsis, and the characters’ mundane ruminations, 
while sometimes tiresome to watch, are important for 
developing characters and setting a historical time and 
place. But the shocking moments of the play — isolated 
spurts of violence — are set so far apart from each other 
that they lose some of their impact. An abridged version 
might have made for a more powerful production.
That said, protracted as they were, the actors’ 
performances were particularly outstanding, surpassing 
the School of Drama’s already high standard for student 
performance. The seven actors rose to the demands 
of incessant, expressive, dialect-heavy and quickly 
delivered dialogue, rarely appearing to falter.
Perhaps the performance of highest note is that of 
senior acting major Mitchell Edwards, who plays Floyd 
Barton. Floyd is an energetic, dreamy, sometimes 
violent character who grapples with his lot as a poor 
black musician on the cusp of a possible record deal 
in Chicago. Edwards seamlessly portrays both Floyd’s 
uncontainable energy and cheer and his moments of 
explosive frustration. 
His female companion and foil is reserved, skeptical 
Vera (played by senior acting major Johari Mackey), who 
?nds comfort in menial, domestic tasks and constantly 
questions her loyalty to the historically unfaithful Floyd. 
Mackey conveys Vera’s more private nature but also 
delivers her character’s rare but stunning passionate 
outbursts in a quavering, but strong voice. Despite 
the shaky state of their characters’ relationship, the 
actors have an easy chemistry: Floyd is cheerful and 
affectionate, while Vera is more likely to brush him aside 
— impatient but quietly fond — while gardening or 
cooking.
Other performances are not to be overlooked, 
however. Each character has his or her moment in the 
spotlight, although some may be brief. Senior musical 
theatre major Harron Alexander as railing, distanced, 
unpredictable Hedley dreams aloud about being a 
“big man” with a carrying, lilting Creole accent. Senior 
musical theatre major Veladya Chapman is perfectly 
hysterical, mothering, and no-nonsense as Louise. And 
though she makes a late entrance, senior musical theatre 
major Alexis Floyd playing Louise’s niece Ruby makes 
her presence known, with her piercing voice, big-booty 
walk, and surprising emotional complexity. More minor 
characters Canewell (senior musical theatre major Jean 
Floradin) and Red Carter (senior musical theatre major 
Erron Crawford) are similarly dynamic, their portrayals 
?uid and colorful despite their supporting roles.
It’s important to note that the seven-person cast is 
entirely non-white. Though the audience isn’t privy 
to casting decisions or the pool from which actors are 
selected, it is a notable choice, especially considering 
that the program ruminates on colorblind casting. 
The cast works seamlessly together and spares us the 
suspension of disbelief involved in ?tting a white actor 
into a non-white role.
Another surprising but important quality to all the actors 
is vocal talent. Vocal music is an integral component to 
Seven Guitars: The play begins and ends in song, and 
we hear every character’s voice, however brie?y, at one 
point or another. It’s used as a vehicle for the emotional 
content of signi?cant scenes. At the play’s beginning, 
Louise breaks the ice with a jokey, improvised tune. 
Later, Floyd offers a chilling, thought-stirring solo seated 
with his suddenly solemn friends. Hedley ends the play 
with a heartbreaking, voice-cracking repetition of a folk 
tune.
Seven Guitars is one of the best displays of sheer student 
skill you’ll see on the School of Drama stage, and it’s 
thought provoking to boot. Just be sure to bring a snack 
and a friend to supplement the long ?rst act.

Hot Licks
Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes
Well, let’s hope he ?nally got it out of his system.
Thom Yorke’s solo work and work with Atoms for Peace 
(which you could call another Yorke solo project) have 
always reminded me of creators that came out of warp 
records in the late ’90s.
Being a long time Radiohead fanboy, I have a love/hate 
relationship with Yorke’s solo work — in that I love it on 
its own but hate its in?uence on Radiohead’s more recent 
albums.
Yorke’s new album Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes makes 
me think the sound that Yorke has been chasing ever 
since Kid A has ?nally come to life. Odd time signatures 
complemented by atmospheric and spacious vocal 
melodies dominate the album.
If you’re a fan of Bonoboo, ambient Aphex twin, or even 
SBTRKT, I would give this album a listen.

Bliss doesn’t live up to its name
School of Drama production suffers from a confusing plot
After feeling trapped in a kaleidoscope at Studio 
205 during one of the School of Drama’s productions 
last year, I was a little apprehensive about going 
to another show in which technology would be 
so heavily featured. I took comfort in the fact that 
it would be in the Rauh Theatre of Purnell — a 
quick getaway should I want to escape during 
intermission.
Unfortunately, Bliss had no intermission.
This play is about Rein, an engineer who invents a 
time-travel machine and accidentally teleports from 
Moscow in the 20th century to Moscow in the 23rd 
century with a geriatric apartment supervisor and 
a kleptomaniac. They end up in a classless, utopian 
society called Bliss, but conflict still arises as the trio 
of main characters explore the new world.
There are many achievements worth mentioning in 
this production. For one, it was a fairly successful 
attempt at comedy, a genre the School of Drama 
historically hasn’t explored too often. As always, 
the cast was incredibly talented; senior musical 
theatre major Annie Yokom (Bunsha) was especially 
delightful to watch.
The costumes demonstrated a stunning attention to 
detail that brought characters to life, and the dial-
inspired stage design was a powerful, yet subtle, 
allusion to the theme of time. The choices to switch 
the genders of the characters and to integrate cast 
members into the physical setting were bold and 
effective.
Most importantly, though, there was a refined use 
of technology. Instead of distracting from or being 
the foundation of the show, the use of projections 
— with the exception of a few scattered instances 
that felt slightly forced — served to enhance the 
production by bringing the setting into the future.
Unfortunately, none of these redeeming factors could 
make up for the fact that, whether lost in translation 
from the page to the stage or butchered by cuts, 
the plot was an unbearable jumble. One minute, the 
audience watched pickpocket Miloslavskaya recite 
poetry for a party; the next, it suffered through a 
garbled scene of drunken tomfoolery. Transitions 
were completely lacking, which left performers 
charging through scenes as if they were walking 
through a swamp, focused only on getting out.
In his playbill note, junior dramaturg Jordan 
Sucher emphasizes the “machinery of society” as 
a construct in the play; however, while there are 
symbols of a totalitarian regime (e.g. everyone wore 
white in the future, and movements, including 
greetings and kisses, were rigidly defined) 
everywhere, the atmosphere created was anything 
but. Again, the mess of a plot made it impossible to 
enjoy the show.
Bliss began with the illusions of time and choice 
resonating as clear themes meant to criticize 
philosophies that “encourage people to follow 
blindly without thinking for themselves and without 
justifying their own actions,” as Sucher says in the 
program, and had all the right components to be 
successful. But as a result of the inherently poor 
script, it disintegrated into a mind-numbingly vapid 
romance that made no substantial commentary on 
past, present, or future society and only offered true 
bliss when it ended.

pillbox 10.06.14
While I’ve written about celebrity fashion multiple times, 
I usually write about being inspired by stars’ styles in 
general, rather than their speci?c pieces of clothing. 
Sometimes, however, stars wear out?ts that are so lovely 
that we just have to copy them. Not all of us can buy the 
exact same clothes as celebrities, so the best thing we 
can do is ?nd out?ts that are really similar. Luckily for us, 
most stores copy styles similar to what celebrities wear, 
so it isn’t dif?cult to imitate their styles. Here are a few 
ideas for how to get some popular celebrities’ styles for 
less!
Here’s a jacket worn by Emma Watson, who has recently 
gained a lot of attention for making a speech about 
gender equality for the UN General Assembly as a UN 
Ambassador.
The out?ts that she makes using this jacket are typical 
of Watson’s polished and classic, yet somewhat edgy, 
style. For instance, she has paired a similar jacket with 
a simple black skirt from the brand Theory, a cashmere 
sweater from the brand Equipment, black tights, and 
short black boots from the brand 3.1 Phillip Lim. She has 
used the black leather jacket as the statement piece of 
her out?t, along with a simple gold pendant necklace. 
While the brand of Watson’s leather jacket is unknown, a 
jacket with a similar ?t and belt can be found at Topshop 
for $136. A gray sweater or a nice blouse can be bought 
anywhere, such as H&M or Forever 21. And the same 
goes for a black mini skirt, since this is a basic piece that 
most stores should carry. As for black boots, 3.1 Phillip 
Lim ones that Watson wears are approximately $525, 
but Lucky Brand’s ‘Bartalino’ Stud Embossed Leather 
Booties are only $99.95 and are about the same.
Another notable celebrity who has been relatively
scandal-free and known for her incredible style is Blake 
Lively. She’s best known for being one of the stars on 
Gossip Girl, but is currently better known for her interest 
in fashion and lifestyle. Her style on a day-to-day basis 
can be described as Bohemian-chic, and is illustrated by 
the out?t to the right.
This out?t can be dressed up or dressed down, and
like Emma Watson’s out?t, can be copied with just a 
few basics. The loose-?tted white T-shirt can be found 
anywhere, but the pants are the statement piece of the 
out?t. Grab yourself a pair of printed pants from Free 
People, such as the Star Crossed Crop Pant for $98. Pair 
these pieces with a pair of black ballet ?ats to dress the 
out?t down or black heels to dress it up, and you’re good 
to go!
Although the Kardashians are pretty unpopular among 
most people, one of the younger members of the family, 
Kendall Jenner, is well known for her fashion. She has 
modeled in Fashion Weeks around the world, has her 
own fashion line with her sister Kylie, and sometimes 
appears in the well-known TV show Keeping Up with 
the Kardashians. Jenner’s style is also very simple and 
polished. 
Jenner has a classic black leather jacket; ou can ?nd 
a similar one from Topshop for only $110, which is 
relatively less than what Jenner’s original would cost. A 
?tted gray T-shirt and dark skinny jeans can complete 
the look, but the main pieces in her out?t are the shoes. 
She has worn printed ballet ?ats that add interest to her 
out?t, as well as 3.1 Phillip Lim calf hair ?ats, which are 
approximately $142. Compare that to the BP ‘Moveover’ 
Pointy Toe ?at from Nordstrom for only $59.95, which 
looks exactly the same, and you could get this look for 
much less.
As you can see, most celebrity styles consist of basic 
pieces that can be found anywhere, with one statement 
piece for which a cheaper copy is easily accessible. For 
this reason, copying a celebrity’s style is a great way
to spice up your wardrobe without spending too much, 
since you probably have basic pieces. Just buying one 
new item of clothing can create a whole new look.

Gone Girl opens with the back of a blond head being 
caressed by a man’s hands. The head obviously belongs 
to a beautiful and elegant woman, resting on the chest of 
her loving and doting husband. Suddenly, the husband’s 
(Ben Af?eck’s) thoughts are introduced via voice-over: 
“What are you thinking? How are you feeling? What have 
we done to each other?” These fundamental questions 
will undoubtedly haunt the rest of the ?lm.
He keeps caressing the golden strands of his wife’s hair, 
as his thoughts turn darker: “I imagine cracking open 
her head, unspooling her brain, trying to get answers.” 
His wife (Rosamund Pike) turns to him with a look of 
concern, almost as if she has heard his thoughts as 
the screen fades to black and the unraveling of their 
marriage begins.
Based on Gillian Flynn’s novel, Gone Girl is about a wife 
who goes missing in the midst of a troubled marriage. 
The premise seems simple and intriguing, but Flynn 
dives into a story of dark complexity that’s drenched in 
tension and suspense —so much so that the novel has 
spent over 79 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller 
list and has sold over 6 million copies. So when a ?lm 
adaptation was announced with director David Fincher 
(Fight Club, The Social Network) aboard, many people 
were not only aware of the plot twists that the movie 
entails, but also held a certain set of expectations.
In short: The ?lm de?nitely holds up. With the screenplay 
adapted by Gillian Flynn herself, the ?lm is loyal to the 
plot of the novel while offering a deliciously slick account 
of a marriage gone horribly wrong as Nick Dunne 
(Af?eck) ?nds his Missouri McMansion in carefully 
crafted disarray as his wife, Amy Elliot Dunne (Pike), is 
nowhere to be found. The ?lm immediately alternates 
between the contradictory narratives of Nick and Amy, 
as Nick struggles to adjust to the national attention of his 
case while Amy details their tenuous marriage through 
her diary entries.
Fincher exhibits a superb craft in ?lmmaking. The 
?lm is slick and suspenseful, carefully building up in 
moments when we don’t know who’s guilty of what. The 
restrained ambience of the ?lm heightens the audience’s 
fear that some characters are not as good as they seem, 
as they meticulously mask their more depraved selves 
from the public.
Fincher and Flynn understand and show that Gone Girl is 
more than a murder mystery. It presents a distorted view that 
crushes the overly idyllic and abstract idea of marriage.
Of course, marriage is hard, hard work. In marriage, 
you are annoyed with or may even resent your spouse, 
but spouses have to learn to work and even ?ght 
productively. 
Through the ups and downs, husband and wife will be 
able to make it work and love each other even more as 
they get to know each other more. Marriage turns many 
spouses into better people; for Nick and Amy Dunne, 
that’s not the case. The more they resent each other, 
the less they realize they know each other. Gone Girl 
dissects the marriage of two inherently sel?sh people 
and, despite whether they are inherently good or evil, 
they were meant for each other.
‘Til death do they part.

If you’re into seeing a movie about monkeys taking over the world, then 
I ?gure you would let a toddler cut your hair or learn English from So?a 
Vergara. But such a seemingly laughable premise as that seen in Dawn 
of the Planet of the Apes can always be redeemed with an unfathomable 
amount of CGI. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes’s apes fall between 2001: 
A Space Odyssey chimps and Curious George — meaning the monkeys 
in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes are so realistically unreal the viewer 
may not be able to connect to the apes, which lengthens the already 
time-consuming movie. However, with that said, the movie is able to 
maintain the appearance of a thought-out and organized symphony of 
moving parts. In conjunction with the actors, the apes turn out to deliver 
great performances, interacting with humans and a post-apocalyptic 
setting. As a follow up to the reboot of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, 
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a solid ?lm worth seeing that will make 
you leave McConomy saying, “Yeah, they’ll make a third one.”
Dawn of the Planet of the ApesCaptain America: The Winter Soldier
Saturday, Oct. 11
8, 11 p.m.
Continuing this week’s theme of sequels, Captain America: The Winter 
Soldier is playing this Saturday. Three words: action, drama, and muscles. 
Unlike the ?rst movie (and most sequels out now), this movie jumps ahead 
almost 70 years into the future. It starts out kind of where The Avengers left 
off, but that does not automatically exclude people who have not seen the 
epic movie involving most of Marvel’s popular superheroes. (Sorry Green 
Lantern’s Ryan Reynolds, you didn’t make the cut.) This shield-toting 
superhero sequel doesn’t require the viewer to have seen the original. 
Many new characters (and bromances) are introduced, as well as old 
recognizable characters. Like any Marvel superhero movie, the action is

VIA, the world-renowned multimedia music festival, 
once again returned to Pittsburgh last week, ?lling every 
nook and cranny of the city with music, experimental 
art, and other events from Oct. 1–5. The festival, which 
has been a staple of the Pittsburgh cultural calendar 
since 2010, expanded to include a simultaneous event in 
Chicago this year, demonstrating the success VIA has 
had in its hometown.
Venues across the city hosted events, so it was virtually 
impossible to hit every event, unless you are one of 
the many Carnegie Mellon students who seem to have 
a time-turner. We at Pillbox threw our lot in with the 
following events, and found out a couple of things, such 
as crowds of hipsters are incredibly boring and there’s no 
bloodlust like video game bloodlust. We also heard some 
music — some of it good, some of it not so good — and 
have decided to share our experiences so those of you 
who couldn’t attend the festival can do so vicariously 
through our carefully crafted words.
Real Estate — Wednesday
In the world of indie surf pop, VIA headliner Real Estate 
is one of the rising stars. Performing their headlining 
set on the festival’s opening night on Wednesday at the 
Altar Bar, the band proved their growing skills as a live 
act.
Each release since 2009’s self-titled Real Estate has built 
upon their growing momentum. On the heels of their 
most recent album, Atlas, Real Estate has grown into an 
independent headliner, taking top slots at the Pitchfork 
Music Festival and, it goes without saying, the VIA 
Festival, among others. The effect of the group’s growing 
popularity could be felt in the room — newer songs such 
as “Talking Backwards” and “It’s Real” were some of the 
few moments when the largely stoic crowd began to lose 
themselves. But that’s okay, because Real Estate isn’t a 
band that inspires passion, but relaxation.
To attend a Real Estate show is to go under hypnosis; 
the soft and bright guitars ?oat gently above the rolling 
sea of grooving bass and steady, controlled drums. 
Singer Martin Courtney’s vocals, cloaked in a warm 
blanket of reverb, sound like distant echoes of thoughts 
shouting from the back of your brain.
Songs like the meandering “Green Aisles” and the 
wistful, lazy jaunt “Beach Comber” felt like a pleasant 
dream performed live. In fact, the rowdiest the crowd 
got all night was after the band left the stage. The entire 
room erupted in impassioned cheers for the band to 
return, violently eager for the mellow vibes to be brought 
back.
If there’s one thing to be said about Real Estate’s fan 
base, it’s that they’re a pretty homogenous bunch. 
Walking into their show, a visitor couldn’t help but shield 
their eyes from the oppressive sameness of a room full 
of people in their mid- to late 20s. The men wore beards 
and vintage zip-up hoodies, and the women’s earrings 
dangled against their necks, their glasses had frames 
that stretched above their eyebrows.
Having come from the same ?ve-mile radius as the band 
members, Real Estate has always been a group close 
to my heart. Ever since hearing the name whispered 
around Ridgewood, N.J. coffeehouses, each new height 
of success they reach serves as a little reminder that 
even if you think you come from nowhere, that doesn’t 
mean you can’t be someone. I’ve said it before and I’ll 
say it again; Real Estate sounds like how it feels to grow 
up in New Jersey. And that’s what made the show a little 
personal. For an hour and ?fteen minutes, it was nice to 
feel like I was back home in Jersey — except without all 
the fear and loathing that comes with living there.
Liturgy, Deafheaven — Thursday
Let me preface this by saying that I have nothing against 
the metal genre — as a young guitar player, I marveled 
at the intricate song structures and lightning-fast ?nger 
work of virtuosos such as Metallica’s Kirk Hammet and 
Slayer’s Kerry King. Is Rob Zombie’s Greatest Hits CD in 
my car? Yes it is. Does it get played? Only at maximum 
volume.
That all being said, Thursday night’s performances at 
the Rex Theater from black metal bands Liturgy and 
Deafheaven just didn’t do much for me. The bands 
(seemingly) performed well, but the sounds of each 
individual instrument just blended into a disorienting 
cacophony. There was no way to distinguish what each 
player (except the drummer) was playing, so I found 
myself unable to establish a connection with the music.
Liturgy’s songs all sounded like a great crescendo that 
never opened up into anything — the music never felt 
like it was allowed to run free. You know how at the 
end of a concert, a band will start making noise on 
their instruments and they’ll hold it and hold it, and 
VIA multimedia music festival returns to the Burgh
Internationally renowned festival ?lls Pittsburgh with music, music nerds, and crazy media

metal, played a headlining set at the Rex Theater in 
Southside on Thursday as part of the VIA Festival.

the tension will rise, until they ?nally all stop at the 
same time? Well Liturgy sounded like that moment, just 
stretched for an entire set.
Deafheaven, known for their brand of melodic 
deathmetal which has helped garner them a decent 
amount of attention and critical respect in musical 
circles far-removed from typical metal heads, gave a bit 
more to chew on. Their use of visuals was particularly 
striking; psychedelic illustrations and animations 
?ashed on a series of disjointed screens behind them, 
often moving in near-perfect time to the music. Lead 
singer George Clarke was energetic and engaged with 
the crowd well. There were also some very peaceful 
moments during songs when the rest of the band would 
drop out and guitarist Kerry McCoy would play some 
very beautiful and melodic guitar interludes bathed in 
lush reverb. But these moments were always followed by 
a sudden assault of screaming and distortion, like biting 
your tongue while chewing on a piece of sweet candy.
All would’ve been well and good if the atmosphere had 
been a more physical one. But Deafheaven and Liturgy 
are deathmetal for the Pitchfork-reading, Brooklyn-
pilgrimaging crowd. This was perhaps the only place one 
would be able to see tattooed biker girls wearing KISS 
Army denim jackets adorned with pentagrams standing 
next to pencil-thin hipsters wearing stiff collared shirts 
and precisely-trimmed beards — and almost none of them 
were moving. Given a recent hand injury, I was expecting 
to have to stand in the back, away from the ?ailing limbs 
and outpouring energy common at performances of 
aggressive music. Instead, I was in the thick of the crowd, 
and the circulation cut off from having my hand tucked 
into my armpit caused the only pain.
VIA Music Conference — Friday
Friday saw the VIA Music Conference, hosted in the 
CFA Studio for Creative Inquiry, arrive on Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. The entire day was stacked with 
lectures and demonstrations of electronic equipment, 
such as Ableton Live. The day concluded with an audio 
visual performance by Richard Devine and Hector 
Llanquin.
Michael Johnsen opened the performance with a set 
of his electronic music. Johnsen got his start working 
in ?lms before leaving to build his own electronics. A 
large, friendly-looking man in Ben Franklin spectacles, 
he sat on the stage surrounded by a mess of wires and 
gadgets that resembled the ?oor of a budding computer 
engineer’s bedroom.
The sounds that emitted from his performance were 
interesting — a mix of watery bass and clicks, whistles, 
and scratches. There didn’t seem to be any discernible 
pattern, but Johnsen’s deliberate movements certainly 
suggested otherwise. At times the sounds were 
engaging, but often the cacophony sounded like a 
chainsaw revving in a slaughterhouse where all the 
animals know exactly what’s in store for them.
In my opinion, the main event did not fare much better.
Llanquin’s visuals were certainly striking — his surrealist 
landscapes of geometric shapes and patterns were very 
well rendered, and successfully created a sense that one 
was ?oating through another world. The Chilean artist 
has worked with multiple formats, including movies and 
video games, and this varied in?uence was certainly 
apparent.
Devine prefaced his audio performance 
with an admission that he had encountered 
a host of technical dif?culties, including 
some broken equipment, prior to the 
performance. “If something catches on ?re, 
well, that’s the end of the performance,” he 
joked.
Devine’s sounds weren’t much different 
from Johnsen’s in terms of aesthetic. 
Industrial and angry screeches emitted 
from the speakers with an eardrum busting 
ferocity. It was hard to feel anything but 
discomfort listening to them, and I couldn’t 
help but wonder whether the music was 
really the result of Satan possessing an old 
Windows 95 machine.

Union Trust Building — Saturday
VIA culminated at the Union Trust Building on Saturday 
night, Oct. 4. The event’s theme was audiovisual 
experiences in the modern world, with an art exhibit 
on the ?rst ?oor showcasing various technologies, and 
the club below, featuring acts performing accompanied 
by visual displays. The performances ranged from local 
independent acts to a welcome host of LGBTQ rappers.
The audiovisual experience began with the art gallery 
on the ?rst ?oor, where two video games, showcased 
on large projection screens, were available to play. The 
?rst game, called Dog Park, allowed four players — each 
playing a roughly 3-D animated dog in a park — to 
simply kill the other dogs. The players’ virtual avatars 
joyously ripped each other apart, the blood and the 
gore of the display contrasting with the low-resolution 
graphics ripped straight from a Wii game, numbers 
popping out of the dogs’ heads as they feasted on 
each other. Players of the game seemed remarkably 
invested, whooping when they managed to knock down 
another dog and maul its defenseless form. Thinking 
back to all the hundreds of faceless human avatars I’ve 
killed in games like Halo or Call of Duty, I became fairly 
unsettled by the display and turned my attention to the 
other game on display—a charming four-player indie-
looking game with simple cartoonish graphics where 
the objective was to cooperate to use an onscreen avatar 
(imagine Catdog, except with human torsos at either 
end) to wrap themselves around a red ball. Both teams 
of two used their own avatars, and the video game 
did a good job of displaying the medium’s power as a 
social accelerator. Completely random strangers were 
laughing and cooperating as they had to work together 
to maneuver their avatar around the ball while fending 
off the other team. It seemed that the exhibit served to 
showcase both the negative and positive potential of the 
gaming medium.
Other art exhibits were also on the ground ?oor of the 
Union Trust Building — all ?tting within the theme 
of digital art. One such exhibit was an audiovisual 
movie consisting of YouTube clips. The clips were 
all extremely surreal, the “weird part” of YouTube for 
those unfortunate enough to be familiar with the term. 
Intriguing at ?rst, each individual clip went on for far too 
long and the exhibit got rather old after a while. Another 
rather interesting exhibit worked within the new ?eld 
of augmented reality. Visitors aimed an iPad camera 
at certain VIA posters arranged around the room and 
saw a 3-D graphic pop up. The graphics were very low 
resolution and looked ripped from a video game circa 
2001, but the exhibit succeeded in its goal to show an 
indication of what could be. The graphics moved and 
had a variety of effects, and perhaps more amazing, 
they even changed their pro?le if looked at from 
different angles, behaving like real objects. With new 
technologies such as Google Glass and Oculus Rift all 
slowly becoming realities, the augmented reality that the 
exhibit’s makers put on display may not be that far away.
The main attractions of the festival were, of course, the 
musical acts in the basement. A host of independent 
artists performed on two stages, with an array of screens 
displaying accompanying visuals. The visual displays 
rarely had anything to do with the acts and didn’t really 
contribute to the experience. In fact, the additional light 
from the display worked against the enjoyment of the 
concerts, as it was already too bright in the basement 
even without the gigantic displays. 
In any case, the acts themselves varied in quality. The 
array of LGBTQ rap performances unfortunately fell 
?at. Between muddy mixing, poor ?ow, and beats that 
weren’t particularly enjoyable (or danceable in any way), 
the performances were sub-par.
Other artists, however, did a commendable job.
Independent act Blue Hawaii, for example, was 
particularly enjoyable. Lead singer Raphaelle Standell-
Preston’s beautiful voice and impressive mixing and 
looping, worked to create a well-rounded set even 
though the underlying beats were rather boring. There 
were stretches when the set dragged, but to Blue 
Hawaii’s credit, they did a good job of mixing up the 
?ow and the sound of their performance. The energy of 
the crowd itself was rather sporadic. For every person 
tangibly contributing to the energy of the ?eld, there 
were many more just standing around, which sort of 
dampened the experience.
Overall, the event was fairly enjoyable. Some of the art 
exhibits, the virtual reality exhibit in particular, were 
cool to experience. The acts themselves were hit and 
miss, but if the festival comes around again, Pittsburgh 
citizens should consider going just for the sheer volume 
and diversity of acts.Zebra Katz performed with visuals from Kevin 
Ramser at Saturday’s event.
