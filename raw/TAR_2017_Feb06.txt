Carnegie Mellon annu-
ally awards the Dickinson 
Prize in Science to “individu-
als in the United States who 
make outstanding contribu-
tions to science.” This year’s 
award, which includes both 
a medal and a cash prize, 
went to Chad A. Mirkin, 
director of the International 
Institute for Nanotechnology 
and the George B. Rathmann 
Professor of Chemistry at 
Northwestern University.
Mirkin has been the 
recipient of over a hun-
dred national and interna-
tional honors and is one of 
fewer than 20 individuals 
who have been elected to 
all three National Science 
academies — the National 
Academy of Sciences, the 
National Academy of Engi-
neering, and the Institute of 
Medicine. He has also played 
a role in creating science 
policy during the Obama ad-
ministration, as he served as 
a member of the President’s 
Council of Advisors on 
Science & Technology. He is 
one of the top cited chemists 
in the world, with over 670 
publications and nearly 300 
patents to his name. He is 
also the founding editor of 
Small, a journal dedicated to 
nanotechnology.
Mirkin accepted the 
Dickinson award on Feb. 
2 and gave a lecture titled

On Tuesday, Jan. 31, Dr. 
John Silvanus Wilson Jr., 
president of Morehouse 
College, the ?rst privately-
established liberal arts college 
dedicated to the education 
of African-American males 
in the country, gave a lecture 
titled “Toward the Beloved 
Community.”
Wilson has dedicated more 
than 25 years to achieving 
a more socially conscious 
education. He started his 
education career serving at 
the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology  and George 
Washington University. He 
also served as the president of 
the Greater Boston Morehouse 
College Alumni Association 
(GBMCAA).
An educator, scholar, 
consultant, and strategist, 
Wilson has served in many 
other organizations such as 
Historically Black Colleges 
and Universities (HBCUs) and 
United Negro College Fund’s 
Institute for Capacity Build-
ing. Prior to being the presi-
dent for Morehouse College, 
President Barack Obama ap-
pointed Wilson to serve as the 
executive director of the White 
House Initiative on HBCUs, 
a position Wilson held since 
2009. With his great abilities 
and efforts, Wilson has made 
great achievements for the 
universities and organizations 
with his vision.
Wilson’s lecture was based 
on a recent article he wrote for 
The Huf?ngton Post, where he 
talked about how Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. changed from 
the 1963 “I have a dream” 
King, which references his 
famous speech delivered in 
front of the Lincoln Memorial 
Re?ecting Pond, to the more 
“angry King,” as witnessed in 
his 1967 speech at New York 
City’s Riverside Church. This  
version of Dr. King said “we 
need a reconstruction of the 
entire society; a revolution of 
values,” and proclaimed that 
“America is much, much sicker 
than I realized when I ?rst be-
gan working in 1955,” due to 
its falling democracy, both so-
cially and economically. Wil-
son’s lecture focused on the 
reasons behind King’s change.
Wilson believes that, in 
2017, everyone in the United 
States has a lot more to learn 
from the wiser and more mea-
sured “angry King”— the King 
who said “we as a nation must 
undergo a radical revolution 
of values.”
Wilson believes that a 
lot of factors from 1963 and 
1967 contributed to this shift 
in King, and believes that the 
factors which caused his shift 
are very similar to today’s 
situation.
He talked about three 
big lessons which could be 
learned from King in 1967.
The ?rst is the necessity of 
moral intelligence, which is 
the socially responsible intel-
ligence. According to King, 
education should equip stu-
dents to do good as they do 
well for themselves. The sec-
ond is aspiration intelligence. 
As King said, it’s a mistake to 
choose chaos rather than com-
munity as our future, and we 
need to have intelligence in 
our aspiration. According to 
King, education is the way 
out of this mistake, the way to 
increase people’s moral and 
aspirational intelligence. The 
third is capital intelligence and 
its importance in education 
and many other institutions.
Chelsea N. Jones, currently 
a master’s student in public 
policy and management at 
the Heinz College, was the 
student speaker this year 
accompanying Dr. Wilson. 
Her talk was about how “you 
do not have to be a radical to 
make a radical difference.” 
She believes that “the best 
way for us to unify is to lis-
ten. Not just to hear, but 
to understand.”

On Thursday Feb. 2, John 
Fabian Witt, the speaker at 
the sixth annual Thomas M. 
Kerr Jr. lecture, discussed 
the subject of American 
Freedom. Witt is the Duffy 
Class of 1960 Professor of 
Law at Yale Law School and 
author of award-winning 
book, Lincoln’s Code: The 
Laws of War in American 
History and has worked at 
Columbia University, the 
University of Texas at Aus-
tin, and also received his ed-
ucation at Yale University, 
where he currently works.
Witt visited Carnegie 
Mellon University as part 
of the Phi Beta Kappa Vis-
iting Scholars program. 
Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 
1776, is the nation’s most 
prestigious academic honor 
society. Its goal is to support 
education in the liberal arts 
and sciences, recognize aca-
demic excellence, and en-
gender freedom of thought.
The title of Witt’s lecture 
was “The Switch: The 
Twentieth-Century Rein-
vention of American Free-
dom.” Over the course of 
his speech, he took the au-
dience back in time to the 
early 20th century, to a time 
where the First Amendment 
of the Constitution did not 
carry the same weight as it 
does today. He would go on 
to discuss the course of hu-
man rights, how they would 
change, and what lessons 
we can learn from the past 
to apply to the present 
and future.
He started his lecture 
by recounting the election 
of President Warren G. 
Harding in 1920. Harding 
was an unlikely choice for 
the Republican party since 
there seemed to be more 
experienced people that the 
party could have chosen as 
nominee. However, due to 
some political maneuver-
ing, he ended up with the 
nomination and ran against 
James Cox. This election 
had implications for the na-
tion since it demonstrated a 
turn from traditional values 
and “second raters” were 
able to win elections.
At the same time, there 
were many riots and labor 
strikes going on around the 
country. One famous failure 
occurred here in Pittsburgh, 
in which the Pennsylvania 
state militia arrived to quell 
hostilities. The Strike, as it 
became to be known, is a 
telling moment in Ameri-
can history, Witt explained, 
as it demonstrated how the 
human collective now ral-
lied around what Witt calls 
“un-reassured politics.”
“Un-reassured politics” 
refers to the newspapers 
back then. Witt stated that 
they were “systematically 
misleading their readers.” 
He drew a connection from 
the lack of responsibility 
in the 1920s to the modern 
era, in which there have 
been many accusations lev-
ied against modern news 
sites for extreme bias. 
He urged the audience to 
consider their news sources,

Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority’s boil-water order cuts off campus waterPeter Cooke, head of the School of Drama, is named Member of the Order of Australia
Professor Peter Cooke, 
head of the Carnegie Mellon 
University School of Drama, 
was named a Member of 
the Order of Australia in the 
Australia Day Honors List on 
Jan. 26.
The Order of Australia 
was established by Queen 
Elizabeth II in 1975, with 
membership being bestowed 
upon Australian citizens as 
recognition of achievements 
or meritorious service. Pro-
fessor Cooke will receive this 
honor at a ceremony in Syd-
ney in May.
According to a Carnegie 
Mellon press release, Pro-
fessor Cooke has over thirty 
years of international ex-
perience as a theater prac-
titioner, administrator, and 
educator. He has expressed 
his honor and joy at receiv-
ing such a prestigious award 
for his “signi?cant service to 
the performing arts, and ed-
ucation, as an academic and 
administrator, particularly 
theatre and dance.”
President Suresh has 
congratulated Professor 
Cooke on his award, stat-
ing that Professor Cooke’s 
professional and leadership 
activities have had a pro-
found impact on the School 
of Drama and Carnegie 
Mellon. Dan Martin, dean of 
the College of Fine Arts, has 
also extended his congratu-
lations to Professor Cooke, 
lauding him as one of the 
best heads of the school he’s 
known in his nearly 25 years 
at Carnegie Mellon, as well 
as crediting his leadership 
for solidifying the School of 
Drama’s position as the lead-
ing theater education center 
in the United States.

Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabi-

Government. 
Carnegie Mellon’s pro-
pensity for empathy is 
always highlighted at times 
of drastic change. Trump’s 
new immigration policy pos-
es a lot of changes to Carne-
gie Mellon students. Trump’s 
executive order, released on 
Jan. 27, limited immigration 
from seven majority-Muslim 
countries for 90 days from 
the date of the order, as well 
as suspended the United 
States Refugee Admissions 
Program. This was preceded 
by an executive order issued 
on Jan. 25 to begin construc-
tion on the wall between the 
U.S. and Mexico which Don-
ald Trump promised during 
his campaign under the simi-
lar pretense of national secu-
rity. This act of speci?cally 
addressing different types of 
immigrants within his orders 
as threats to our nation’s 
safety, paired with increased 
immigration regulation and 
surveillance, has left many 
unsure of their permanence 
or state of welcome in the 
United States.
Carnegie Mellon’s re-
sponse to this, as always, has 
taken a very thoughtful ap-
proach of constructive con-
versation and sharing of ex-
periences. Across the board, 
very few places on campus 
have kept quiet about the 
changes in our country. 
From faculty to staff to stu-
dents, the Carnegie Mellon 
community is coming 
together to make sure that 
the signi?cance of these 
immigration changes is not 
left understated. President 
Suresh publicly declared 
a stance of support for im-
migrants and the Mechani-
cal Engineering depart-
ment hosted a town hall on 
immigration.
In terms of related talks, 
Counseling and Psychologi-
cal Services (CaPS) hosted 
an event on Sunday, Feb. 5 
for students affected by these 
executive orders to provide a 
place for discussion and sup-
port. My Facebook feed has 
been ?ooded with insightful 
articles and phone numbers 
of representatives you can 
call to voice your opinion. 
There are so many places on 
campus to speak about your 
ideas on these new actions 
and so many places to listen 
to students who may feel 
personally affected by these 
changes.
So where does the 
Student Body President’s 
Cabinet lie in this? We stand 
?rmly in support of the right 
of every student to get an ed-
ucation and to feel safe in the 
space they’re in. We hope to 
act upon this by continuing 
to support the free exchange 
of ideas, like at Pizza and 
Conversations. However, if 
you have any ideas on events 
you want to see hosted, you 
can always stop by of?ce 
hours on Thursdays or con-
tact anyone on Cabinet. In 
case you have any questions 
about the event or how CaPS 
intersects with these execu-
tive orders, you can always 
email outreach-at-caps@an-
drew.cmu.edu.
On Jan. 31, the Pittsburgh 
Water and Sewer Author-
ity (PWSA) issued a precau-
tionary ?ush and boil order 
for drinking water supplies 
across much of the city. 
The PWSA found low 
levels of free chlorine in the 
drinking water at a single 
location near the Highland 
Park. The advisory was thus 
issued as a precaution.
This order resulted in all 
water fountains on Carn-
egie Mellon’s campus being 
shut off. Students living in 
dormitories, such as Fair-
fax Apertment, The High-
land Aprtment, Shady Oak 
Apartments, Neville Apart-
ments, and Webster Hall 
were affected on the ?rst 
day of this advisory. By the 
second day, all dormitories 
were affected.
The university secured 
nearly 20,000 bottles of 
water to distribute to the 
campus community due to 
expectations that the boil-
water order would continue 
for several days, according 
to a university press release.
Yet by Feb. 2, the PWSA 
lifted the boil water order 
and declared that there was 
no longer a potential risk to 
the drinking water supply, 
though the university has 
advised students to let taps 
run for two minutes before 
drinking the water and re-
suming normal procedures 
as a precaution.
On Feb. 4, Carnegie Mellon’s Chinese Students and Scholars Association hosted its annual Chinese New Year Gala which included a family dinner, performances, and booths to allow students to fully experience Chinese culture.

February 6, 2017 « The Tartan thetartan.org/news » A3
Things Matter” at Carnegie 
Mellon, which was followed 
by a reception.
According to Mirkin, a 
nanoscale object is defined 
as an object which has at 
least one dimension — 
length, width, or height — 
that is between one and 100 
nanometers.
The lecture started with 
an introduction to the his-
tory of nanotechnology. A 
historical use of nanoparti-
cles was in the stained-glass 
windows that adorned many 
historical buildings, even 
though people didn’t know 
that at the time these build-
ings were being designed 
and built. Mirkin then delved 
into the modern period of 
nanotechnology expansion 
and research. While it is dif-
ficult to pinpoint an exact 
start to this modern period, 
Mirkin pointed to a lecture by 
Richard Feynman at the Cal-
ifornia Institute of Technol-
ogy called “Plenty of Room 
at the Bottom”, in which 
Feynman hypothesized that 
we may be able to arrange 
atoms in exactly the way 
we want in the future, and 
a nanotechnology research 
initiative spearheaded 
by then-president Clin-
ton in 2000, as catalysts 
for the growth in interest 
in nanotechnology in 
the past few decades.
Mirkin emphasized that 
nanoscale objects can have 
very different properties 
from their macroscale coun-
terparts. An example of a 
property that changes with 
size (and shape) is Rayleigh 
scattering — the scatter-
ing of light by the particles 
themselves. He showed a 
slide comparing the scatter-
ing colors of different gold 
and silver nano particles. For 
example, gold spheres at the 
scale of 100 nanometers cor-
respond to a yellow-orange 
color while gold spheres at 
around 50 nanometers cor-
respond to a light green col-
or. This is why stained-glass 
windows could maintain 
their bright hues over cen-
turies without degradation, 
unlike most paints.
He also mentioned 
various technologies that 
are needed in order to ma-
nipulate objects on a small-
er-than microscopic scale. 
These include the scanning 
electron microscope, the 
transmission electron mi-
croscope, and the scanning 
tunneling microscope.
The atomic force 
microscope is used in dip-pen 
nanolithography, the tech-
nique of using a microscopic 
tip — which could be made of 
different materials, such as 
rubber or harder spring-like 
materials — to print patterns 
using different kinds of 
“inks” on various solid sub-
strates. Mirkin played a 
major role in developing 
the technique of dip-pen 
nanolithography, eventually 
expanding it to a printing 
method containing tens of 
thousand of tips. There are 
wide-ranging applications 
because this technology al-
lows the manipulation of 
different substrates (such 
as biosensors) at the submi-
croscopic scale. Thus, this 
nanolithography method 
was recognized by National 
Geographic as one of the 100 
discoveries that changed the 
world.
Mirkin emphasized the 
theme of applying nano-
technology in biology and 
medicine. He mentioned 
Verigene, a test developed 
by one of his companies that 
looks for gene abnormal-
ity or infection in a patient’s 
blood and allows better di-
agnosis, reduces cost, and 
lessens the prescriptions of 
needless antibiotics, which 
can cause antibiotic resis-
tance. It reads the DNA of a 
patient and through this in-
formation can detect genetic 
mutations and sensitivity to 
different drugs. In addition, 
his group played a major role 
in developing spherical nu-
cleic acids, which are nucleic 
acids “wrapped” around 
an inorganic nanoscale 
core. This allows them to 
penetrate cells and take 
measures on them while 
they are alive, opening up 
the possibilities of personal-
ized treatment or medicine.
There are still many 
challenges for expanding 
this combination of medi-
cine and nanotechnology, 
mostly because humans are 
living beings with unique 
chemical environments. “De-
veloping and understanding 
how new types of drugs can 
work in living systems is not 
a trivial process, and it re-
quires a lot of refining and 
a lot of experiments,” said 
Mirkin in an interview with 
The Tartan.
However, despite the 
challenges, Mirkin sees a lot 
of potential for the field of 
nanotechnology in the fu-
ture. “I think nanotechnolo-
gy is the answer to two major 
unmet medical needs—one 
is the ability to get DNA and 
RNA-based drugs into organs 
where you can flip genetic 
switches and correct disease, 
and where you can harness a 
patient’s immune system to 
create new types of cancer 
vaccines,” said Mirkin.
Perhaps the smallest 
technologies available to 
us is the next “big thing” 
in terms of making prog-
ress with some of the 
most challenging areas for 
medical researchers today.
John Fabian Witt discusses the reinterpretation of free speech
Chad A. Mirkin highlights the importance and scienti?c applications of nanoparticles
and consider whether we are 
making better choices now 
than almost 100 years ago.
Witt then went on to 
discuss the four most im-
portant domains of social 
life which reinterpreted how 
we use free speech. Accord-
ing to him, these are the 
arts, the work done on free 
speech by the American Civ-
il Liberties Union (ACLU), 
labor movements, and the 
actions by the state.
An example of the arts 
influencing free speech are 
plays and movies that, by 
modern terms, would be 
deemed racist. However, in 
one anecdote Witt shared, 
he explained that one movie 
which was boycotted for its 
racism was written by a man 
who would eventually lead 
the NAACP. So was it within 
his power to write it, or was 
it a violation of free speech 
to ban the movie?
The ACLU changed our 
interpretation of what free 
speech means. Before this 
era, you could be jailed for 
saying the wrong thing, an 
idea that goes against the 
grain of our modern values. 
By fighting against things 
such as the Espionage Act, 
which incriminated people 
that spoke against the war 
effort, they changed the 
meaning of free speech to 
what we identify it as today.
Labor movements were 
also useful in the change of 
the 1920s. Both public and 
private strikes were com-
mon in this era, and were 
one of the defining charac-
teristics of this generation.
Finally, the actions and 
attitudes of the federal gov-
ernment also influenced 
this change, which Witt 
titles “the switch.” With a 
newfound desire to increase 
the rights of its population, 
actions such as the Scopes 
Trial increased “civil lib-
erties,” a term that began 
its usage around this era. 
Thus, a new era of consti-
tutional interpretation was 
born.
At the end of his speech, 
Witt asked the audience to 
consider how we can use 
the lessons of the past in 
the present. He urged us 
to think critically about 
our rights and how people 
fought to protect them, and 
elaborate upon them.

How to make the most of EncompassCMU after the fair ends  
JADE CROCKEM
Publisher
EncompassCMU is ?nally 
here. For some, it’s the ?rst of 
many job fairs in their college 
career, and for others, it’s 
their fourth or ?fth job fair 
this semester alone. This is the 
time for you to get your foot in 
the door and get your résumé 
into the hands of an actual 
person instead of just blindly 
submitting it on Handshake. 
EncompassCMU may be where 
your work begins, but your job 
is far from over if you hope to 
land an internship from any of 
the companies present.
Follow Up Interviews
Some of you may end up 
leaving EncompassCMU with 
an interview from a company 
you spoke to. It is important 
that you ?nd out as much 
information as possible about 
a company before interviewing 
with them. You may have 
gotten away with only knowing 
the name of the company and 
what their main business is 
at the job fair, but that is not 
enough information for you to 
make a lasting impression at 
an interview. Companies want 
to see that you’re interested 
and knowledgeable about 
their company. Take a little 
extra time to do a bit more 
research about the speci?c 
department you would like 
to work in at their company. 
If something about how the 
company operates is unclear 
to you, take note of it and at 
the end of the interview when 
the interviewer asks “do you 
have any questions,” you’ll be 
prepared.
Make sure to also ask about 
the company culture and 
views to ensure that this is the 
company for you. You don’t 
want to end up spending an 
entire summer at a company 
that has an environment that 
doesn’t ?t you well. Internships 
are important in ?guring out 
what you want to spend your 
years after Carnegie Mellon 
doing, and interviews are an 
integral part of that step.
Recruiters 
receive a lot 
of résumés at 
job fairs, but 
by contacting 
someone after 
the initial 
meeting, you 
can ensure that 
your name will 
stand out and 
your résumé 
will end up in 
the right hands.
Contact Recruiters
If someone gives you a busi-
ness card, make sure to send 
them a follow up email to dis-
cuss job opportunities. Recruit-
ers receive a lot of résumés at 
job fairs, but by contacting 
someone after the initial meet-
ing, you can ensure that your 
name will stand out and your 
résumé will end up in the right 
hands. 
Career fairs are all about 
giving your résumé the person-
ality that you can’t always put 
on paper, and making the ef-
fort to contact a recruiter after 
meeting them shows them that 
you are persistent and passion-
ate about their company.
Some recruiters will tell you 
to also apply online after you 
speak to them at Encompass-
CMU. This can increase your 
chances of your résumé being 
seen and now they’ll be able 
to match your name and face. 
If a recruiter is telling you this, 
it is because they want to make 
sure that your résumé ends up 
in their database, so make sure 
that you do so before the end of 
the day.
Make a Spreadsheet
Applying, interviewing, and 
speaking to companies at job 
fairs can get exhausting. It’s 
hard to keep track of who you 
have and haven’t talked to be-
fore. Try keeping a spreadsheet 
of all the companies you’ve 
been in contact with. 
Make sure to update your 
spreadsheet after job fairs to 
re?ect who you’ve met and in-
terviewed with. 
This can also help keep you 
on track for who to reach out to 
with follow-up questions if you 
keep the company’s contact in-
formation in the spreadsheet 
as well. 
Keep detailed notes of what 
the job would entail in your 
spreadsheet so that you know 
which companies to contact 
based on your interests.
Don’t Give Up
For some people, all it 
takes is one job fair or one 
interview to ?nd a job, but for 
most others, it could take 10 
job fairs, 20 interviews and 
almost 100 online applications. 
Everyone’s job search process 
is not the same. You could 
end up applying to almost 50 
companies before you even get 
the chance to do an interview. 
Don’t feel discouraged if 
EncompassCMU leaves you 
empty-handed. It takes more 
than just one job fair to make 
or break your future career. 
Persistence is key! So make 
sure to get out there and give 
EncompassCMU your all.

paring for EncompassCMU vis-

Make the most of your time at EncompassCMU this week 
BRADEN KELNER
Special to The Tartan
University career fairs 
can sometimes seem like 
madhouses, with hundreds of 
employers visiting each day 
and an even greater number 
of students passing through. 
Nevertheless, it’s important 
to remain collected and 
professional when presenting 
yourself to the people who 
will hopefully soon be hiring 
you for a full-time position or 
summer internship. Here are 
?ve things you should be sure 
to bring to EncompassCMU 
to make sure you strike the 
perfect ?rst impression.
The right attire
Looking like you know 
what you’re doing is half the 
battle at a career fair. To make 
your attire re?ect the con?-
dence employers want to see 
in candidates, stick to a formal 
dress code.
For men, wear a business 
suit with a solid shirt or one 
that has a clean pattern. Tuck 
in your shirt, and wear a belt 
even if you don’t need one. 
Don’t forget a tie and a pair of 
black or brown shoes to ?nish 
off your look. 
For women, wear a suit or 
a skirt with a suit jacket. Pair 
neutral colors with black or 
gray, and wear ?ats or profes-
sional heels to complement the 
out?t. Both men and women 
should take the time to iron 
out wrinkles in your pants 
and shirt and to brush off any 
smudges that may be lingering 
on your jacket. As for hygiene, 
make sure your hair is cleaned 
up — cut and combed — and 
you look as if you got more 
than your fair share of sleep 
the night before, even if you 
haven’t.
Lists of companies to visit
Before attending the 
fair, visit the Career and 
Professional Development 
Center’s career fair webpages 
to view the companies coming 
to campus. 
Research companies that 
interest you and make a list of 
the ones that seem to be good 
?ts. 
For the companies you’re 
head over heels for, consider 
spicing up your résumé and 
making unique copies, rather 
than a general résumé, to fo-
cus on the qualities you know 
those companies are looking 
for. 
Hand your general résumé 
out to the companies you’re 
less interested in, but would 
still be happy to work for. 
By researching companies 
beforehand, you’re sure to 
make a better impression with 
recruiters. 
Knowing a company’s work 
and how you can speci?cally 
help the company will de?nite-
ly make you stand out from the 
rest of the pack.
A portfolio for résumés
Have a handful of résumés, 
but don’t know what to do with 
them? Take a trip to the Uni-
versity Bookstore to pick up a 
portfolio. 
These ?rm folders for your 
papers will round out your 
professional look. Not only do 
they look sleek, but they also 
ensure that you won’t suffer 
any résumé snafus, like drop-
ping all your papers or acci-
dentally handing a recruiter 
a unique résumé intended for 
another company.
Portfolios are easy to tuck 
under your arm and walk with, 
and they also add to your air of 
professionalism while giving 
you something to do with your 
hands. 
These handy folders allow 
you to organize your résumés, 
and a list of references and 
samples of your work if your 
?eld typically requires those 
elements.
A water bottle and food
Career fairs can become 
packed and hectic. To give 
yourself some relief in your 
multiple layers of clothing, 
bring a water bottle. Take a 
drink of cool water if you’re 
feeling hot or overwhelmed. 
Staying hydrated will ensure 
that you are focused before 
you visit the companies that 
potentially hold your dream 
jobs. Before the fair, also make 
sure to eat. Sometimes, you 
may ?nd yourself waiting in 
unexpectedly long lines, which 
could cut into time allotted for 
lunch after the fair. Even if the 
fair isn’t crowded, it’s always 
better to be over-rather than 
underprepared.
The right attitude
Remember that you’re at 
the career fair to land a job 
or internship. Act that way. 
Approach all recruiters as if 
you want nothing more than to 
work for their company. Greet 
them enthusiastically and 
shake their hand ?rmly.
Show them what quali?es 
you for a position at their 
company through an already 
prepared speech, but be sure 
to be ?exible in what you’ve 
prepared if the recruiter 
has other plans for your 
conversation. Be ready to 
answer some tough questions, 
and don’t break a sweat if you’re 
not able to adequately answer 
one. Answer it to the best of 
your ability and get ready for 
the next question.  Ask the 
recruiter some questions to 
show your interest and ensure 
that a position at the business is 
something you want to pursue. 
Thank the recruiter at the end 
of your conversation and follow 
up with an email after.

It’s never too early to ?nd your dream job at EncompassCMU
NIVEDITA CHOPRA
Special to the Tartan
If you walk into the 
Cohon Center Tuesday and 
Wednesday while taking 
the warmer route to class, 
you may feel out of place 
amongst an exceptionally 
well-dressed crowd, the likes 
of which are rarely seen on 
campus outside of the Tepper 
School of Business. It’s that 
time of year again: various 
companies are here this week 
for EncompassCMU, the 
semester’s largest career fair. 
The fair will take place 
in the Wiegand Gymnasium 
from 10 a.m.–12:45 p.m. for 
internship opportunities and 
2 p.m.–5:45 p.m for full-time 
positions, although students 
are welcome to attend either 
session if they have class con-
?icts. If you’re a ?rst-year or 
sophomore, chances are that 
you’re not going. Perhaps you 
intended to go, but are now 
having second thoughts given 
the number of jobs that go to 
upperclass students. 
On the other hand, you may 
be going, but mainly for the 
swag — free stuff, for the un-
initiated. Here are some better 
reasons to go to Encompass-
CMU as an underclassman.
Nothing to lose
Take a moment to sit 
back and think about your 
dream job. I bet there will 
be at least one company at 
EncompassCMU where you can 
get that job, or do something 
related that’s equally exciting. 
This semester’s 
EncompassCMU is one of the 
few events at which you’ll have 
absolutely nothing to lose by 
talking to recruiters. 
Your passion may even 
impress them enough to land 
you that dream summer job! 
You’ll never know if you don’t 
take the plunge.
Prep for future fairs
If you’re ?rmly convinced 
that there’s no way that the 
company of your choice will 
hire a freshman or sophomore, 
here’s a more practical reason 
to go to EncompassCMU. 
Going to EncompassCMU 
this year is good preparation 
for your following years at 
Carnegie Mellon. Attending 
this semester will allow you 
to feel what it’s like, so that 
you know what to expect 
as an upperclass student. 
Simply walk up to the 
company that you’re eyeing 
for a job in the future, and 
chat with the recruiter. Ask 
about the company’s required 
quali?cations and interview 
process, so that you know 
what they’re looking for and 
can be better prepared for the 
following year, when you’re in 
the running for a job.
Small booths are hiring
While you’re at it, check out 
some of the smaller booths that 
none of the upperclassmen are 
going to. Chatting with the 
recruiters there is less stressful 
— sometimes even fun — 
and can de?nitely boost your 
con?dence. And remember, 
they’re hiring too. So if they 
offer any opportunities you’re 
interested in, go for it! The 
odds of getting that job are 
substantially higher and the 
company probably pays more 
than traditional summer 
employers. So, hunt out your 
nicest formal clothes and be 
prepared to join the crowd of 
well-dressed students. Draft a 
quick résumé — or update an 
already existing one — and 
print out a few copies. Make a 
name tag, dress nicely, and get 
ready to go.

Trump’s border policies threaten nation’s foundation
SYDNEY ROSLIN
Two weeks ago, much of the 
country was up in arms when White 
House senior advisor Kellyanne 
Conway spoke about “alternative 
facts” being used to describe the 
crowd size at President Trump’s in-
auguration. Her blatant acknowl-
edgment of the inaccurate state-
ments used and accepted by the 
Trump administration made the 
rest of the country wonder what 
else in Trump’s rhetoric had been 
made up. Now, some Twitter users 
are attempting to call out President 
Trump by tweeting factual state-
ments about scienti?c and environ-
mental issues.
These accounts, includ-
ing @AltNatParkSer (“The Unof-
?cial #Resistance team of the U.S. 
National Park Service”), @Rogue-
NOAA (“Research on our climate, 
oceans, and marine life should be 
subjected to peer, not political, re-
view”), and @NASAGoneRogue 
(“NASA Employees taking a stand”), 
have begun tweeting messages about 
atmospheric conditions, scienti?c 
theories, and climate change. Many 
of them have speci?cally called out 
President Trump, warning him and 
his administration about the dan-
gers of ignoring climate change and 
other environmental issues.
These accounts popped up fol-
lowing an incident over the week-
end of Trump’s inauguration in 
which the National Parks Service 
retweeted a message on their of?-
cial Twitter account from The New 
York Times reporter Binyamin Ap-
pelbaum that negatively compared 
crowd sizes at Trump’s inauguration 
to Barack Obama’s. After seeing the 
retweet, the Trump administration 
asked the Interior Department to 
cease using Twitter for that week-
end. The retweet has since been 
taken down, and the agency later re-
ported that the Twitter ban came out 
of a concern that the account had 
been hacked, as the agency does not 
typically share crowd size estimates.
Following the temporary ban, 
the of?cial Twitter account of Bad-
lands National Park wrote several 
unauthorized tweets af?rming cli-
mate change research. “Today, the 
amount of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere is higher than at any 
time in the last 650,000 years. #cli-
mate” one tweet said, followed by 
“The pre-industrial concentration 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
was 280 parts per million (ppm). As 
of December 2016, 404.93 ppm.” 
The tweets were later deleted, but 
the message was quickly taken up 
by the rogue Twitter user behind 
@AltNatParkSer, and the many oth-
er rogue accounts that followed suit.
On one hand, these rogue ac-
counts are a fantastic example of 
the power of social media to allow 
for freedom of speech. It is no secret 
that the Trump administration does 
not believe in man-made climate 
change. President Trump’s nominee 
to head the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, Scott Pruitt, has said on 
record that the effect of humans on 
climate change is “subject to more 
debate.” He also had a major role 
in suing the Obama administration 
over its climate and environmental 
rules. Indeed, scientists across the 
country are worried that the new 
administration will not ?ght for so-
lutions, or even recognize the prob-
lem. So where the of?cial environ-
mental agencies of the United States 
government aren’t allowed to step in 
and establish what the research the 
administration refuses to accept, it 
is good to have private citizens make 
people aware.
However, there is a danger in 
the rogue accounts that is similar 
to the danger that we faced dur-
ing the election in regards to fake 
news sources. These Twitter ac-
counts are essentially that — fake 
news sources. They are unveri?ed 
accounts mimicking of?cial govern-
ment agencies with facts and sta-
tistics that, to the average person, 
seem credible. While it is true that 
anyone could look at the Twitter bio 
of these accounts to see that they 
are unof?cial, a quick scroll through 
a news feed wouldn’t tell a Twitter 
user whether or not the account can 
be trusted.
These accounts are indicative of a 
larger issue  — people are angry that 
the Trump administration seems to 
ignore what is proved science on 
the subject of climate change. The 
‘Rogue’ government tweets demonstrate free speech

On Jan. 27, 2017, President Donald 
Trump signed Executive Order: Pro-
tecting the Nation from Foreign Ter-
rorist Entry into the United States, 
which prohibits citizens and refu-
gees from seven majority-Muslim 
countries from traveling and emmi-
grating to the United States. The or-
der has enforced a 90-day ban on all 
entry into the U.S. for those coming 
from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Su-
dan, Syria, and Yemen. Travelers try-
ing to enter the United States from 
these countries have faced inde?-
nite airport detainment, and at least 
60,000 visas have been revoked. U.S. 
citizens and dual-citizens from one 
of the seven banned countries will 
be admitted on a case-by-case basis.
There has also been a restructur-
ing of the United States’ refugee pro-
gram. Despite the United States’ ref-
ugee vetting system being one of the 
strictest in the world, Trump believes 
there is more the government should 
be doing. The entire refugee admis-
sions system has been entirely shut 
down for 120 days, and the Syrian 
refugee program has been suspend-
ed inde?nitely. Religion has become 
the basis for the admission of refu-
gees, with an emphasis on admit-
ting refugees who are of a minority 
faith in their country. The order has 
forced many already-admitted refu-
gees into an uncomfortable limbo, 
making them unsure of the future of 
their place here.
Before analyzing the obvious 
moral wrongdoings of this executive 
order, let’s ?rst discuss the illegiti-
macy of its institution. In 1962, Ex-
ecutive Order 11303 was signed to 
dictate and standardize how further 
orders should be prepared, ?led, and 
published. Order 11303 states that 
any proposed order must be signed 
by the Director of the Of?ce of Man-
agement and Budget (OMB) and by 
the Justice Department. Both the 
Justice Department and the OMB 
denied to respond when asked if 
Trump’s order had been through this 
process. Whether or not you agree 
with the order, it should be at the 
very least concerning that the Trump 
administration has seemingly no in-
terest in behaving in accordance 
with precedent.
The executive order has widely 
been referred to as a “Muslim 
Ban,” and has received sup-
port from members of the 
Republican party, includ-
ing Vice President 
Mike Pence and 
House Speaker 
Paul Ryan. 
Unsurprisingly 
and deserv-
ingly, the order 
has also re-
ceived a lot of 
backlash. Sev-
eral lawsuits 
have emerged 
and countless 
protests have been ?lling airports 
around the nation. Former Act-
ing Attorney General Sally Yates, 
who has since been ?red for her 
opposition, believes the ban is un-
constitutional because it targets a 
particular religion. However, the 
Trump administration has made its 
attempts to discourage the idea that 
the executive order is a ban against 
Muslims.
It is admittedly hard to believe 
that the administration does not 
equate Islam with terror when the 
seven countries included in the ban 
are all countries where the majority 
religion is Islam. However, many are 
wondering why, if Trump’s goal is to 
prevent terrorism, countries whose 
citizens have committed acts of ter-
ror against the United States have 
not been included in the ban. It is 
also dif?cult to view this as anything 
other than a Muslim ban when the 
executive order has barred Syrian 
refugees, but will make exceptions 
for Christian refugees.
The executive order does not use 
the word “Muslim” in its language, 
but Trump’s statements tell a dif-
ferent story. In 2015, Trump stated 
that the United States should imple-
ment a “complete shutdown of Mus-
lims,” and ban them from entering 
the country because “most Muslims 
protect terrorists.” These claims 
are dangerously untrue. In 2016, 
Trump stated he does not intend to 
distinguish between radical Islam 
and peaceful followers because “you 
don’t know who is who.” Some time 
later he claimed that Muslims are 
trying to “take over our children 
and convince them how wonderful 
ISIS is.” This was yet another grossly 
incorrect and offensive statement 
by the then-president-elect. When 
asked by a reporter in December, fol-
lowing his recent election, if he still 
believed in creating a Muslim reg-
istry, he responded, “you know my 
plans.”
If you weigh the rhetoric of the or-
der with the astoundingly offensive 
and misleading comments made by 
Trump, it is clear that the goal of his 
administration is not as well-inten-
tioned as the administration would 
like us to believe.
The order is 
not the only 
border-control measure that the ad-
ministration is working on. Trump 
has voiced his plans for a wall that 
will span the length of the southern 
border of the United States. It’s ob-
vious that this measure targets one 
group of people.
Whether or not you support the 
wall is irrelevant in understanding 
that Trump has misled the Ameri-
can people countless times. Trump 
has convinced supporters of the wall 
that it will stop illegal immigration at 
our borders. There are several ?aws 
with this logic. Firstly, analysts from 
the Department of Defense believe 
the majority of illegal immigration 
is done via air travel. Secondly, visa-
overstayers make up a vast majority 
of illegal immigrants, not those who 
illegally cross the border. Thirdly, 
illegal immigration in states who 
share a border with Mexico is declin-
ing, while it has been increasing in 
more distant states like Washington, 
Pennsylvania, Virginia, and others.
Trump maintains that the wall 
should cost $8 billion, but experts 
from MIT agree that a much more 
realistic price tag is anywhere be-
tween $25 and $40 billion. There is 
a signi?cant lack of funding for the 
construction of more secure fencing, 
let alone a wall of this size. Trump 
has also misled supporters into be-
lieving that he could force Mexico 
into paying for the wall. Realistically, 
money for this project would have to 
come from U.S. taxpayers or a tax on 
imports. Large border projects have 
been attempted before. In a report 
from the Department of Homeland 
Security, it is estimated that the gov-
ernment has wasted $69 million in 
taxpayer dollars trying to build bor-
der walls, proving that the wall is 
both geographically irrelevant and 
an economic disaster.
Let’s pretend that the border 
wall is economically feasible and 
that Trump’s true goal is to protect 
U.S. citizens. This does not make up 
for the immorality of his plans. The 
United States was founded on the 
idea that anyone, of any religion, 
should be free and safe from perse-
cution. The Statue of Liberty reads: 
“Give me your tired, your poor, your 
huddled masses yearning to breathe 
free.” President Trump’s plans for 
our nation’s borders has turned 
away the tired and the 
poor. They have turned 
away those yearn-
ing to breathe 
free. There is 
beauty in diver-
sity. Our diver-
sity can make 
us a strong, 
compassionate 
nation if we give 
those around us 
the chance to live a 
free and prosperous 
life, a life that every-
one on this Earth is 
entitled to.

Presidents’ use of executive orders abuses original intentions
Fighting fascism with ‘niceness’ is idealistic, ineffective
Lisa Qian/Staff Artist
Diane Lee/Staff Artist
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
Last week, I made a terrible mis-
take: I engaged in a political debate 
on Facebook. My opponent was a fam-
ily friend with a familiar and increas-
ingly frustrating argument. Basically, 
she expressed her unhappiness with 
how polarized and angry everyone 
has gotten since the election, and 
argued that everyone should just try 
to get along and “choose love.” I ar-
gued that was a load of unproductive, 
idealistic crap. Don’t get me wrong. 
This family friend is a perfectly nice 
person with good intentions. But in 
these strange and terrifying times, 
“niceness” is exactly what I’ve got a 
problem with.
Niceness is valuable in ordinary 
circumstances. You could even say 
it’s the glue that keeps civil society 
together. Saying “please” and “thank 
you,” smiling at the appropriate 
times, and making pleasant small 
talk allow people to calmly navigate 
their days without killing each other.
However, little more than a week 
of T****’s reign has proved that these 
are far from ordinary circumstances. 
My personal worst-case scenario for 
the next four years is the rise of a 
global far-right neo-fascist state. If 
you think such fears are overblown, 
consider the Holocaust Museum’s 
new sign for “The Early Warning 
Signs of Fascism,” which went viral 
over the weekend.
Let’s do a brief run-through. 
“Powerful and continuing nation-
alism” – check, see every ugly red 
hat reading “Make America Great 
Again.” “Disdain for human rights,” 
“identi?cation of enemies as a unify-
ing force,” “obsession with national 
security,” “religion and government 
intertwined” – check, check, check, 
check, see the Muslim Ban. “Cor-
porate power protected” – check, 
T****’s countless violations of con-
?ict of interest laws. “Disdain for in-
tellectuals and the arts” – Hamilton, 
SNL, need I go on? “Obsession with 
crime and punishment” – have you 
read his Twitter? “Rampant crony-
ism and corruption” – have you seen 
his inner circle? “Rampant sexism” 
– well, that’s just par for the course 
among right-wingers. Is this starting 
to feel ominous yet? The only signs 
T**** hasn’t explicitly hit are “Labor 
power suppressed” and “supremacy 
of the military,” but keep your eyes 
peeled for the legalization of running 
over protesters and the Trumpian 
Gestapo.
In extraordinary circumstances, 
the true colors of niceness are re-
vealed. The daughter of a Holocaust 
survivor said it best: “Nice people 
made the best Nazis. Or so I have 
been told. My mother was born in 
Munich in 1934, and spent her child-
hood in Nazi Germany surrounded 
by nice people who refused to make 
waves. When things got ugly, the 
people my mother lived alongside 
chose not to focus on ‘politics,’ in-
stead busying themselves with hap-
pier things. They were lovely, kind 
people who turned their heads as 
their neighbors were dragged away.”
It turns out that niceness is 
a lesser virtue, shallow and sel?sh, 
where as true compassion and kind-
ness are deep. While the dominant 
goal of niceness is to avoid con?ict, 
the purpose of kindness is to actually 
help others. While niceness keeps 
a careful distance from the world’s 
problems, kindness gets its hands 
dirty. Unlike kindness, niceness is ut-
terly useless in the face of real evil.
Take the example of punching Na-
zis, which recently threw liberal dis-
course into a frenzy. Punching Nazis 
is de?nitely not nice. But it is some-
thing more important than nice: 
useful. After alt-right (read: 
Neo-Nazi) leader Rich-
ard Spencer got 
punched on live 
TV, he stated 
that he was 
now wary of 
leaving his 
house for fear of 
a repeat occurrence. Punch 
a Nazi, and he becomes a 
little more afraid of airing his 
disgusting views.
If you don’t believe me, 
take it from Spencer him-
self: “We have to get serious 
about security… or we can’t 
have a public movement and 
without a public movement 
we can’t win.” Hitler himself 
expressed a similar sentiment: 
“Only one danger could have 
jeopardized [the rise of Nazi 
Germany]… if our adversar-
ies… had from the ?rst 
day annihilated with 
the utmost brutality 
the nucleus of our 
new movement.”
Nazis like Spencer want niceness. 
They want nice people to nod politely 
as they debate the merits of a “peace-
ful ethnic cleansing.” They want nice 
people not to call them out in inter-
views, and they de?nitely want inter-
views. The more traditional and far-
reaching the news source, the better. 
They want to turn the most abhor-
rent brand of white supremacy into a 
pleasant, respectable topic of debate.
Punching Nazis, while not nice, 
cuts into their hopes of achieving all 
this. Yes, free speech is vital and must 
be protected now more than ever. 
However, there is a fundamental dif-
ference between allowing Nazis to 
speak without legal punishment and 
allowing Nazis to speak on NPR. The 
former is a right granted to Ameri-
cans with even the most revolting 
views. The latter brings those revolt-
ing views into the average American 
living room. The latter legitimizes 
Nazism, normalizes Nazism, and 
yes, advertises Nazism. Punching 
Nazis doesn’t deprive them of free 
speech, but it does push them and 
their “views” back into the shadows 
of deplorability – where they belong.
Like my family friend on Face-
book, you may now want to quote 
Martin Luther King, Jr.: the liberal 
icon of paci?sm. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. would never consider violence an 
acceptable political strategy. Martin 
Luther King would be nice. If you’re 
invoking MLK to invalidate militant 
anti-fascism, there’s a good chance 
MLK would place you in the category 
“white moderate.” He had some ?rm 
words for white moderates, and I will 
also urge all “nice” liberals to listen.
“I have almost reached the regret-
table conclusion that the Negro’s 
great stumbling block in the stride 
toward freedom is not the White 
Citizen’s Council-er or the Ku Klux 
Klanner, but the white moderate who 
is more devoted to “order” than to 
justice; who prefers a negative peace 
which is the absence of tension to a 
positive peace which is the presence 
of justice; who constantly says “I 
agree with you in the goal you seek, 
but I can’t agree with your methods 
of direct action,” wrote King in a 
1963 letter from Birmingham Jail. 
“Shallow understanding from people 
of goodwill is more frustrating than 
absolute misunderstanding from 
people of ill will. Lukewarm accep-
tance is much more bewildering than 
outright rejection.”
I will never advocate violence, 
but I do believe that this nation, 
democracy, and the world 
are in crisis. I believe 
that Nazis 
and fascists will continue to take the 
T**** presidency as an opportunity 
to gain power. While liberals and 
white moderates are occupied trying 
to bring these people to the table of 
discussion and compromise, I believe 
they will continue to charge forward, 
trampling human rights — and hu-
man lives — in their wake. The 
stakes are too high for niceness. We 
all must take a bold stand and choose 
kindness — active and forceful kind-
ness — instead.
If we want to prevent the worst-
case scenario, all liberals should 
abandon “niceness” as a political 
stance. Instead of niceness, refuse 
Neo-Nazis the courtesy of a legiti-
mate public platform. Instead of 
niceness, persuade those in your net-
work to take full advantage of their 
democratic rights (protest, contact 
your representatives, express your 
dissent). Instead of niceness, choose 
instead to loudly and repeatedly re-
ject all omens of fascism. Resist now. 
Not tomorrow, not at midterms, not 
when T****’s policies inevitably 
strike you personally, but now. Resist 
now and fascism won’t win.

The countless headlines last week 
have left a number of Americans 
questioning the lack of limits on 
authority that has been granted to 
presidents through executive orders. 
This fear is justi?able, as the idea of 
any individual having the power to 
make such orders is both frighten-
ing and a risk to the welfare of this 
nation. However, this is nothing new 
and is something that should have 
been considered long be-
fore the election of Presi-
dent Trump.
With Trump’s im-
migration order, we 
saw just how damag-
ing this kind of policy 
can be to the nation if 
left unchecked. Is this 
newfound concern a 
result of recent times, 
or something that has 
been left unchecked 
throughout the his-
tory of our nation?
Executive orders 
date to the beginning 
of this nation and 
originate from Article 
II of the Constitution, 
through which the 
president is granted 
“executive power.” It 
directs presidents to 
“take care that the 
laws be faithfully 
executed.” This 
does not give the presi-
dent the authority to create 
new laws or allocate new funding 
from the treasury. It simply allows 
them to use laws and funding that al-
ready exist to carry out actions.
As controversial as they may be, 
most executive orders simply enforce 
ignored laws that have existed for 
years. Trump’s wall order did not 
allocate new funding to the build-
ing of a wall. It simply directed the 
Department of Homeland Security 
to use existing funding to expand the 
physical barriers at the border. Some-
thing as signi?cant as a border fence 
that costs billions must go through 
Congress for legitimacy. The Secure 
Fence Act of 2006, which called for 
700 miles of physical barriers on the 
border, did just this.
A look at the change in the way 
executive orders have been used 
throughout history still brings 
uneasiness. The ?rst 17 presidents 
each signed fewer than eighty 
executive orders, with most signing 
far fewer than that. In the entirety of 
George Washington’s presidency, he 
signed only eight executive orders 
according to The American Presi-
dency Project. In the ?rst week of 
Trump’s presidency, he signed seven. 
A comparison between the executive 
orders of the ?rst and second halves 
of American presidents has shown 
just how much their role has expand-
ed in American politics throughout 
history. George W. Bush penned 291 
orders and Barack 
Obama, 276. 
This is nowhere near the 
record of 3,721 signed by Franklin D. 
Roosevelt.
With such a high number of ex-
ecutive orders, sometimes the line 
between an order that creates a 
new law and an order that utilizes 
existing laws is not always clear. 
Take for instance, Franklin D. Roos-
evelt’s Executive Order 9066, which 
imprisoned hundreds of thousands 
of Japanese-Americans in one of 
the most controversial decisions of 
American history. If one man can 
make the decision to unjustly impris-
on hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
can citizens through executive order, 
it becomes clear that executive order 
grants the president far more power 
than interpreting and enforcing 
existing laws. The power to revoke 
legal residency and visas without any 
justi?cation or legislative approval 
whatsoever has also now gone be-
yond just enforcing existing laws.
While the power granted by them 
is unsettling, executive orders have 
also shaped U.S. history. Both the 
Louisiana Purchase and the Eman-
cipation Proclamation were a result 
of executive orders from Thomas 
Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, 
respectively. More recently, the 
Deferred Action for Childhood Ar-
rivals has granted amnesty to hun-
dreds of thousands of immigrants 
who have called America home 
since childhood. Executive or-
ders can be used for good but 
their potential for destruction is 
large enough (as we saw with 
Roosevelt and are now seeing 
with Trump) that we should 
not let them go unchecked; 
there must be some limit 
placed on them.
With over 14,000 ex-
ecutive orders signed 
into action, it’s clear 
that whether or not 
we like it, executive 
orders have been a ma-
jor part of American his-
tory. With President Trump, 
Americans are now being awak-
ened to the possible negativities of 
granting such power to one individu-
al. With both the executive and leg-
islative branches being controlled by 
the same party, the potential power 
that Trump could have through if ex-
ecutive orders are left unchecked is 
troubling. However, as we saw with a 
federal judge’s order to halt Trump’s 
immigration policy for visa holders, 
there is a limit on executive orders 
and as long as we remain cautious 
and wary of the possibilities, we can 
prevent the next generation of Amer-
ican internment camps.

Scientists de?antly tweet facts
Bannon is prejudiced, un?t for Security Council
owners of these rogue accounts 
are aiming to educate the public. 
However, by marketing themselves 
as unof?cial accounts of of?cial 
organizations, they run the risk 
of being lumped in with the fake 
news sources from both the left 
and right that plagued the election 
season.
The fake accounts also play into 
the echo chamber issue that faces 
many social media users. Whereas 
the @AltNatlParkSer gathered 
14,000 followers on Twitter, the 
people who choose to follow a 
clearly liberal account like this are 
more likely to be people whose be-
liefs line up with a liberal Twitter 
account. When we have accounts 
like these that saturate news feeds 
rather than people relying on of-
?cial accounts and news sources, 
the conversation with the other 
side of the argument becomes 
more and more biased and further 
away from resolution.
It is wonderful that these facts 
are being put on the internet, 
for the public to see. However, 
it would be even better if these 
accounts could stand on their own, 
and not claim to be af?liated with 
government agencies in a way that 
will perpetuate the problem of 
fake news.
These are vital conversations 
to be having, especially as the 
environmental conditions of our 
country and our planet worsen ex-
ponentially. These conversations, 
however, need the backing of cred-
ible sources and veri?ed facts. We 
can’t ?ght biased rhetoric with 
potentially biased rhetoric — we 
need to ?ght it with indisputable 
facts and hard evidence coming 
from trusted places.
For the Twitter users who come 
across these rogue tweets, I en-
courage you to read them, take 
them with a grain of salt, and use 
them as a springboard to research 
environmental issues with infor-
mation from of?cial agencies and 
news sources. Spread this vital in-
formation, but do it with solid facts 
from credible places.

Last week, President Donald 
Trump added his controversial chief 
strategist, Steve Bannon, to the Prin-
cipals Committee of the National 
Security Council, the main advisory 
body within the White House that 
helps to plan and execute the presi-
dent’s foreign policy. At the same 
time, the president removed the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence from the 
Principals Committee. This move, 
the latest in a series of mounting 
controversies surrounding Bannon, 
is outrageous and dangerous for 
three reasons. First, Bannon’s hateful 
and bigoted record makes him un?t 
to objectively advise the president 
on matters of national security and 
foreign policy. Second, Bannon lacks 
any experience or quali?cations in 
foreign policy that would make him 
?t to serve in this capacity. Finally, 
Bannon’s explicitly political role 
within the Trump administration, 
coupled with the purging of apo-
litical of?cials like the Joint Chiefs, 
implies that Trump’s foreign policy 
decisions will be guided by political 
expedience, rather than national in-
terest or security.
Bannon should not 
advise President 
Trump on 
issues of national security because 
his history of personal prejudice 
renders him incapable of making 
objective decisions in foreign affairs. 
Before joining Trump’s campaign, 
Bannon was the Chairman of Breit-
bart, a far-right political website with 
white-nationalist ties and a history 
of racist and sexist articles. Bannon 
also has his own history of making 
anti-immigrant, Islamophobic, anti-
semitic, and misogynistic statements. 
Truthfully, these views make him 
un?t to serve in the White House 
in any capacity, because Bannon’s 
in?uential role within the Trump 
administration gives him a powerful 
national platform to push for regres-
sive domestic policy changes that 
will harm immigrants, women, and 
religious and ethnic minorities in the 
United States.
But Bannon now has a platform 
from which he can export his extreme 
and dangerous ideology to the entire 
world. The president depends on the 
National Security Council to review 
the intelligence that the government 
gathers and to make decisions about 
how to protect the United States 
from foreign threats. This requires 
that members of the Principals Com-
mittee objectively assess the infor-
mation they are provided, so the 
committee can create practical and 
well-grounded recommendations to 
the president. How can Bannon be 
trusted to objectively assess intelli-
gence from a majority-Muslim 
nation given his well-documented 
history of anti-Muslim sentiment? 
Likewise, how can Bannon be trusted 
to provide level-headed council on 
Israel, when he criticized his daugh-
ters’ school because of their Jewish 
classmates? Bannon’s worldview is 
clouded by prejudice, and that makes 
our nation less safe.
Bannon has no experience in for-
eign policy or national security. It’s 
striking that the president chose to 
remove from the National Security 
Council some of the nation’s fore-
most experts on military strategy and 
intelligence, namely, the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and the Director of National 
Experience. Each of these public ser-
vants has decades of experience in 
assessing threats to national secu-
rity and helping to shape the nation’s 
foreign policy and military strategy. 
Some argue that Bannon’s past mili-
tary service is experience enough. 
However, Bannon only served for 
seven years, and he left the Navy 
over thirty years ago. Moreover, he 
was an of?cer charged with execut-
ing military strategy, not a strategist 
helping to shape it. Bannon’s role on 
the National Security Council is one 
normally reserved for generals.
Trump’s decision to reorganize 
the National Security Council is un-
acceptable because it sends a clear 
message that the White House in-
tends to politicize the nation’s ap-
proach to security. Bannon’s role 
in the White House is as its chief 
political strategist. In other words, 
it’s his task to shape the administra-
tion’s message and public image. 
While the political strategists of 
previous administrations, such as 
Karl Rove and David Axelrod, have 
been informed on the National Secu-
rity Council’s deliberations, neither 
sat on the Principals Committee or 
shaped the actual policies it created. 
By removing apolitical actors like the 
Joint Chiefs and replacing them with 
Bannon, Trump clearly plans to put 
his political image over the nation’s 
security. Protecting national security, 
setting military strategy, and shap-
ing foreign policy all require hard 
choices, including decisions that 
might be unpopular with the public, 
who don’t have access to the classi-
?ed information that contours the 
realities of such situations. As chief 
political strategist, Bannon’s role isn’t 
to make tough, unpopular decisions, 
but, in fact, to do just the opposite. 
Trump has demonstrated that he 
intends to put political expedience 
over national security, and that is un-
acceptable. He must remove Bannon 
and reinstate the Joint Chiefs and the 
Director of National Intelligence.
While Congress doesn’t have the 
authority to remove Bannon from 
the White House entirely, they do 
have the power to reverse Trump’s 
decision regarding the National 
Security Council if he refuses to do 
so. Congress created the National 
Security Council with the 1947 
National Security Act. That act des-
ignates several “statutory attend-
ees” who are required by law to be 
included in its deliberations, includ-
ing the Vice President, Secretary 
of State, and Secretary of Defense. 
Congress should amend the act to in-
clude the Joint Chiefs and the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence as statu-
tory attendees. In addition, Congress 
should amend the National Security 
Act to stipulate that no member of 
the president’s administration with 
an explicitly political role, such as 
the chief strategist, can be installed 
onto the Principals Committee. Steve 
Bannon, because of his prejudice, 
inexperience, and politicized role 
in the Trump Administration, 
makes the United States less 
safe. Congress must act to 
remove him from the Na-
tional Security Council if 
Trump refuses to do it 
himself.

Democrats must rethink trade positions or risk losing supporters
ARKA ROY
Junior Staffwriter
It has only been a few months 
since the Democratic Party lost the 
election, and it seems like they have 
already started to forget one of the 
primary causes of their failure: trade. 
Liberal institutions such as The New 
York Times have taken advantage of 
the fact that the Trump administra-
tion adopted anti-trade policies to 
undermine a legitimate position. 
They have grouped exiting the Trans-
Paci?c Partnership (TPP) as part of 
the larger xenophobic narrative that 
has caused the Muslim ban and the 
funding of a wall on the border with 
Mexico.
Ever since Trump ended the 
deal, it has been decried as yet 
another political blunder by the in-
experienced administration as well 
as a complete upheaval of one of 
Barack Obama’s trademark policies. 
However, this brand of reporting cre-
ates the impression that, since Trump 
opposes a policy that Obama enthu-
siastically supported, Trump must 
be implementing a foolish policy. By 
adopting this course of action, the 
liberal elite risk further alienating 
their blue-collar electorate whose 
abandonment of the party resulted in 
Trump’s ascendancy.
In the primaries, the Bernie Sand-
ers candidacy revealed the deep 
division in the Democratic Party 
between skilled white-collar elites 
and blue-collar working people that 
had lost their jobs due to prior trade 
agreements. Hillary Clinton’s past 
endorsement of the North Ameri-
can Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) 
and her support of the TPP hurt her 
in the primaries and during the gen-
eral election as Trump continuously 
attacked her for her pro-trade stance.
Many liberals and their economic 
experts dismiss anti-trade posi-
tions as the same brand of mindless 
populism that led to the election of 
Trump, and believe that his support-
ers are inspired by the xenophobic 
forces behind anti-immigration poli-
cies. These fallacious arguments are 
designed to invalidate the anti-trade 
forces within the democratic 
party by associating them 
with Trump.
Before accepting this 
false association, one must 
consider that progressive 
icons such as Senators Ber-
nie Sanders and Elizabeth 
Warren have vehemently op-
posed the TPP, and with good 
reason. Though the TPP has 
received support from Barack 
Obama and other prominent Demo-
crats, they represent the neoliberal 
wing of the party that blindly pro-
motes free markets with no limita-
tions. Proponents of this deal claim, 
as with all other trade deals, that this 
would greatly bene?t the American 
economy.
When NAFTA was rati?ed by 
Congress, it was promoted as a deal 
that would immensely improve the 
American economy. Yet in retrospect, 
experts agree that it improved the 
GDP by less than 0.5 percent. At the 
same time, workers in highly paid 
manufacturing positions lost their 
jobs, because the products they were 
making could be created with lower 
costs in Mexico’s low wage economic 
environment. This greatly in?uenced 
the manufacturing-based indus-
tries in states such as Pennsylvania, 
Michigan, and Ohio. Not only were 
old jobs lost, but new manufactur-
ing jobs that otherwise would have 
been created in America were in-
stead created in Mexico, as that led 
to companies incurring lower costs of 
production. By not adding to Amer-
ica’s manufacturing jobs, this indi-
rectly harmed many members of the 
workforce.
While NAFTA harmed the manu-
facturing sector of the American 
economy, the TPP threatened to 
undermine the very sovereignty 
of all governments involved in the 
deal, and their ability to protect 
their citizens.
Through the investor-state dis-
pute settlement (ISDS) provisions, 
foreign companies could sue gov-
ernments for enacting policies that 
harm their pro?ts. Essentially, if a 
Japanese company deemed an Amer-
ican environmental regula-
tion harmful to its pro?ts or a 
drug safety standard to be too 
costly to abide by, they could 
sue the American government 
for the loss of pro?t.
These disputes are settled 
by private arbitration pan-
els composed largely 
of unelected cor-
porate lawyers who 
are not accountable to anyone. The 
settlements reached by these panels 
could force governments to abandon 
a regulatory law that would protect 
or improve the lives of its citizens. 
The TPP would undermine the power 
of governments involved in the deal 
and lead to companies dictating how 
countries are governed. By suing 
governments for large sums of mon-
ey they cannot afford, corporations 
could have controlled which regu-
latory statutes a country can estab-
lish. As a result, foreign corporations 
would gain an unprecedented level of 
in?uence over governments.
Recent media attacks on the anti-
trade stance have not addressed any 
of these concerns, but have been 
aimed to convince the public that 
trade deals have become the victim 
of the same brand of populism and 
xenophobia that caused Brexit and 
the election of Trump. However, peo-
ple oppose these deals because they 
have never been designed to help 
the American worker, or even the 
American government. Instead, their 
purpose was to advance the cause of 
the lobbyists who helped write the 
agreement in complete secrecy. Con-
tinuing to pursue this strategy would 
not only be harmful for working class 
people, but for the democratic party 
itself.
Democrats have always been on 
the side of labor and working people, 
yet in this election the party lost due 
to its failure to secure those votes. 
The last time the Democratic party 
lost in the states of Pennsylvania 
and Michigan was back during the 
Reagan-Bush Era. As trade became 
such a large issue in this election cy-
cle, the people of these states could 
not support a candidate who spent 
her entire career championing these 
trade policies.
To move forward, Democrats need 
to adopt a united stance on trade. 
They can no longer blindly promote 
and defend their neoliberal ideology 
and expect the electorate to accept 
it. That strategy worked before since 
no candidate on either side opposed 
corporate-friendly trade deals.
With the rise of authoritarian 
populists and general anti-trade, iso-
lationist attitudes around the world, 
Democrats ?nally have an incentive 
to correct their stance on trade. In 
general, trade deals with the right 
parameters and negotiated by both 
corporations and labor have the po-
tential to be bene?cial for all par-
ties involved. Deals such as the TPP 
however, were created with no trans-
parency to the public and advisory 
boards composed of lobbyists from 
large corporations advising nego-
tiators from each of the countries. A 
deal drafted by corporate lobbyists is 
bound to re?ect the interests of those 
same corporations. The party should 
not denounce trade but rather en-
dorse fair trade deals that represent 
a balance of interests between cor-
porations as well as labor. If it fails to 
do so, they risk further dividing the 
Democratic party amongst socioeco-
nomic lines, which could spur the 
destruction of the Democratic party.

Scott Institute to host talk on energy, water, smart cities
The relationship between 
sustainable urbanization, 
energy and water runs 
deep, and one cannot be 
discussed without invoking 
the others. A sustainable 
city is one that considers 
its intake of resources and 
expulsion of waste with 
respect to the environment; 
a smart city is one that uses 
technology to achieve this 
description. At the forefront 
of energy and sustainability 
research is the Wilton E. 
Scott Institute of Energy at 
Carnegie Mellon, which will 
be hosting an event on Feb. 16 
called Building a Smart and 
Resilient City: The Energy-
Water Nexus. A part of a larger 
program called Resilient 
Pittsburgh, this event aims to 
highlight the interconnection 
between energy and water.
The keynote speaker is the 
deputy director of the Energy 
Institute and professor at the 
University of Texas, Dr. Mi-
chael Webber. Webber has 
been instrumental in promot-
ing the energy-water discus-
sion. His book “Thirst for 
Power: Energy, Water, and Hu-
man Survival” highlights the 
intimate relationship between 
those two resources. Webber 
will speak for about half an 
hour. The event includes six 
other panelists whose roles 
range from mayor to CEO.
Anna Siefken, the Scott In-
stitute associate director for 
innovation and strategic part-
nerships, is central to the plan-
ning for this event. Siefken 
stressed the synergy between 
energy and many other aspects 
of a sustainable city: “Energy 
and infrastructure, energy 
and transportation; they are 
all interconnected things, but 
the energy that powers them is 
an important aspect.” She also 
emphasized that the 
Scott Institute’s role 
“is to be a voice and 
connect people with 
information.” 
This event does just that, 
providing the Carnegie Mellon 
community with access 
to the great minds at the 
forefront of urban planning, 
energy production and water 
conservation.
This event also gears stu-
dents towards thinking about 
energy’s role in their future 
?elds of work. Siefken wants 
“students  who leave to know 
that there’s a role for them 
and that sustainability, in any 
position they have, can have 
an impact.” Carnegie Mellon 
complements its rounded 
education with events like 
this.
The Scott Institute, and 
Carnegie Mellon as a whole, 
has supported Pittsburgh’s 
drive for sustainability. “There 
is a partnership between the 
university community and 
the city of Pittsburgh,” says 
Siefken. In fact, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s efforts to transform Pitts-
burgh into a smart city have 
already began to take effect, 
and can be seen in projects like 
Metro21 and Traf?c21.
Pittsburgh may serve as 
an example of the promise 
American cities have to trans-
form their energy and water 
demands for a safer environ-
ment. Tracey Greenstein of 
Fobres describes Pittsburgh as 
“a hub for sustainable design, 
green technology” and “a shin-
ing example for how the rest of 
the country should operate.” 
By uniting several leaders in 
the ?eld of energy, this event 
initializes that process.
Organizers of the Energy-
Water Nexus event expect 
to accommodate about 400 
guests for an hour and a half. 
Half the spaces are already 
gone, so all those interested 
should quickly register on its 
Eventbrite page. This talk is 
an ample opportunity for stu-
dents to understand the roles 
energy and water play.
Doomsday Clock moved minutes closer to midnight
The Bulletin of the Atomic 
Scientists just moved the 
Doomsday Clock two minutes 
and 30 seconds to midnight. 
Reasons for the decision in-
clude increased nuclear  pro-
liferation, climate change, a 
rise in nationalism worldwide, 
the randomness of the Trump 
administration and, to a lesser 
extent, regular disregard for 
scienti?c opinion and fact. 
This is the closest the clock 
has been to midnight since 
1953, when the ?rst hydrogen 
bombs were being tested.
The Doomsday Clock is a 
symbolic representation of 
mankind’s proximity to an-
nihilation, with 12 a.m. being 
the apocalyptic hour. In 1945, 
scientists invented the clock 
after witnessing the immense 
devastation atomic bombs 
unleashed on Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, seeing that human-
ity possessed the technology 
to destroy cities in a matter of 
seconds.

Snapchat ?les for $3 billion IPO, ?nally goes public
The latest social network 
to cause a frenzy, Snapchat, 
has just ?led for an initial 
public offering (IPO) worth 
$3 billion. Perhaps the most 
expensive IPO ever, its value 
surpasses that of Facebook’s 
and Google’s at the times of 
their IPOs. This pricey IPO 
comes at no shock, as the 
founders of the media sharing 
juggernaut evaluate the app at 
$25 billion.
Snapchat and its unique 
take on how people share 
photos, ?lters, video, texts and 
their daily lives launched it 
to the top of the social media 
bubble. So much so that other 
apps, such as Instagram, 
copied the  successful formula.
An IPO is a company’s ?rst 
sale of stock to the public, 
turning it from a private ?rm 
to a public one. Selling stock 
allows a company to generate 
stock by issuing dept or equity, 
and several tech companies 
eventual do so.

Trump’s Twitter found to be insecure by hackers
Donald Trump’s Twitter 
account, which he uses 
incessantly, is incredibly 
unprotected, especially since 
he is currently the President 
of the United States. He still 
uses a phone running an 
Android operating system. 
Donald Trump’s account 
has been hacked before, but 
that was before he became 
the leader of the free world. 
Should hackers gain access to 
his account, they could ma-
nipulate stock markets and 
foreign policy to their bene?t, 
as Trump’s tweet usually do.
Although Twitter does not 
offer special protection for 
politicians, it does provide 
users with the option of two-
factor authentication before 
access to their accounts is 
granted. Trump does not 
employ any of these measures. 
When attempting to login to 
the page, hackers even noted 
that the page is registered 
with a Gmail account.

The Milky Way is being pushed by unseen forces
The Milky Way is being 
pushed through the universe 
by an unseen force. Scientists 
published a paper last year 
detailing what is known as 
the dipole repeller effect and 
its effect on the motion of our 
home galaxy; this is a push-
like phenomenon exerted by 
large expanses of emptiness 
in space. On the other end of 
the push is a pull from a large 
group of galaxies 75 million 
light-years away called the 
Shapely Attractor.
The researchers created a 
3D map of the ?ow of galaxies 
in our region of space. They 
found that galaxies ?ow in 
gravitational streams like wa-
ter running downhill, repelled 
by regions of empty space 
and attracted by areas with 
denser matter. This repeller 
force adds to the Milky Way’s 
velocity of about two million 
kilometers per hour, which 
was caused by the expansion 
of the universe.

Last year is hottest year on record for third time in a row
2016 is now the hottest year 
on record. This has happened 
consecutively for the last three 
years and 16 times since the 
beginning of the millennium. 
The Earth’s temperature has 
steadily increased throughout 
the 20th century, but warming 
accelerated in the 1980s.
The climate scientists 
that conducted this research 
concluded that about 75 
percent of the increased glob-
al temperature is due to hu-
man activity. They surmised 
that such heating has less 
than one in a million chance 
of happening had human ac-
tivity been taken out of the 
equation. Evidence of climate 
change has shown itself in 
several forms, including more 
frequent extreme weather 
and the reduction of arctic ice 
that occurs at a rate of 13.3 
percent per decade. Scientists 
expect warmth records to be 
continually broken for the 
foreseeable future.

2020 Olympic medals to be made from old phones
For the 2020 Olympics, 
Japan will make medals with 
old phones. The public will 
be asked to donate their old 
phones in order to amass two 
tons of gold, silver and bronze 
for the 5,000 medals. The 
Olympic committee cited the 
limited amount of resources 
in Japan and on the planet as 
their reason for the idea; they 
also wish to create awareness 
about recycling.
Olympic medals are 
traditionally made from metal 
obtained from mines. Japan, 
however, does not have the 
luxury of having resource 
deposits below its territory. 
It will place boxes in local of-
?ces and telecoms around the 
country, where citizens can 
drop their unused electronics. 
Phones contain small amounts 
of the rare metals such as 
those needed for the medals, 
which will be obtained using 
re?ning and chemical separa-
tion methods.

Carnegie Mellon is 
establising itself in the tech 
startup world. With futuristic 
research occurring in all of its 
departments, the university 
presents its students with 
virtually unlimited resources 
to create the country’s most 
innovative technological com-
panies. Concurrently, the city 
of Pittsburgh is morphing into 
an innovation and tech hub, 
ripe for new business. Thus, 
it is unsurprising that Rough 
Draft Ventures, General 
Catalyst’s student-led pro-
gram that backs founders at 
the university level, has taken 
notice of the area’s promise 
and turned its attention to 
Carnegie Mellon and its start-
ups.
Rough Draft was found-
ed in 2013 by then-senior 
at Harvard University Peter 
Boyce II, who aimed to bridge 
the gap between funding and 
college startups. The program 
was a welcome twist to the 
business. It relates to and 
understands its college-level 
entrepreneurs effortlessly, 
because the program itself 
is student-led. A team of stu-
dents comprised of individu-
als from a variety of back-
grounds and schools meets 
once a week to hear student 
founder pitches and to make 
recommendations for backing 
highest potential companies. 
Moreover, it views its 
youthful team, not as a limi-
tation, but as an asset. On its 
website, the program proudly 
describes itself as “the next 
generation of founders” 
and “a student team, build-
ing and empowering the 
largest network of student 
founders” across universities. 
Business Insider’s Julie Bort 
labelled it “a new kind of VC,” 
acknowledging the novelty 
of the young and vibrant 
student-led program. 
Rough Draft has rapidly 
made a name for itself by 
backing companies such 
as developer tool company 
AppHub out of MIT, and 
travel company Freebird out 
of  Harvard Business School, 
creating almost 600 jobs in 
a matter of years. With an 
established presence at other 
prestigious schools, Rough 
Draft’s next stop is, under-
standably, Carnegie Mellon.
Leading the program’s 
move to Pittsburgh is Carnegie 
Mellon junior Akshay 
Goradia, an information 
systems and human-computer 
interaction major who joined 
the Rough Draft team in 2016. 
Before becoming a member 
of the student team, Goradia 
pitched the move to Carnegie 
Mellon’s budding startup 
?eld. “Pittsburgh has a rich 
density of entrepreneurship 
and Carnegie Mellon 
has a uniquely strong 
entrepreneurial ecosystem, 
so I made that proposal,” 
said Goradia in an exclusive 
interview with The Tartan. 
 
Indeed, Goradia correctly 
describes Carnegie Mellon as 
a melting pot of technology 
and startups, so much so 
that Rough Draft has already 
backed their ?rst CMU 
company. 101 Edu, Inc. is an 
educational platform founded 
by chemical engineering Ph.D. 
student Justin Weinberg. 
Already in use at six east coast 
and midwestern universities, 
101 Edu is “reimagining the 
college STEM [science, tech-
nology, engineering and 
math] classroom with active 
learning,” as is stated on its 
homepage. Also displayed 
on its website are instructors 
and students alike beaming 
about the practicality the 
app has introduced into their 
chemistry courses. Nothing 
more could epitomize Rough 
Draft’s ethos, which is to 
“provide much more than just 
capital to emerging student-
led startups.” as stated by 
Goradia. 
Early capital can be helpful 
for young companies that are 
testing their product and look-
ing to take it to the next level. 
Beyond capital, Rough Draft’s 
ability to connect with fellow 
student founders, as well as 
gain support from mentors, 
proves immeasurably helpful 
for early success. 
Boyce is joined by Natalie 
Bartlett and Denali Tietjen 
who work with the student-
led ventures to provide access 
to resources such as service 
providers, mentorship around 
launching a product or fund-
raising, as well as connecting 
the teams to mentors with ex-
pertise. 
VCs are a pivotal difference 
between success and failure. 
They are the metaphorical 
nudge young businesses need 
to stand on their feet, and that 
is why Rough Draft’s arrival at 
Carnegie Mellon only means 
lucrative growth for the start-
ups going forward.

The source of energy once 
promised to the rid the earth 
of air-borne pollutants — 
while providing cheap fuel for 
an inde?nite period of time 
— lost support from both the 
public and private spheres. Is 
our current skepticism toward 
nuclear ?ssion justi?ed? Or 
are we ignoring what may be 
the solution to the global en-
ergy crisis?
A nuclear energy 
renaissance was not long 
ago, as in the early 2010s 
support for nuclear power 
had expanded across the 
world. However, in the wake 
of Fukushima, plans to con-
struct nuclear power plants 
were abandoned in almost 
every country. Earthquakes 
such as the one which caused 
the 2011 Japanese tsunami 
are a fact of life, and it may 
not be possible to construct 
an entirely quake-proof pow-
er plant.
Yet, the damage to 
Fukushima in 2011 occurred 
mostly because of a tsunami, 
not an earthquake. Further-
more, certain areas of the 
world experience signi?cantly 
less seismic activity than oth-
ers. For example, building 
nuclear reactors in the east 
coast of the United States 
is, on the whole, safe from 
these types of geological 
events. Nonetheless, the 
rapid increase in hydraulic 
fracturing may be triggering 
earthquakes in previously 
geologically placid areas.
Even given the rare — 
yet potentially catastrophic 
— risks of ?ssion reactors, 
nuclear power may be signi?-
cantly safer than fossil fuels 
in the long run. So, why does 
the public have so much fear 
towards an economically and 
environmentally viable fuel? 
Part of the reason could be 
miscommunication between 
scientists and the public. 
Nuclear power has been rep-
resented as a dangerous fuel 
for decades, and the media 
has fomented resentment 
towards the energy source 
in society. Perhaps scientists 
who support nuclear power 
need to communicate with 
the public directly, and to 
explain that nuclear plants 
are not as dangerous as the 
public opinion implies.
Carbon-free and cheap 
nuclear ?ssion without 
accidents still presents a 
currently unsolved dilemma: 
the storing of nuclear waste. 
As of now, we currently 
enclose nuclear waste in 
materials that will hold them 
for potentially thousands 
of years, and bury these 
materials deep within the 
earth. Do we trust these 
methods for protecting us 
from the nuclear waste? Is the 
consequence for these casings 
cracking — thereby leaking 
the waste into groundwater 
— too dire to justify the risks? 
We do not have any economi-
cal clean alternatives at this 
moment. Perhaps storing 
nuclear waste is a small price 
to pay for a clean atmosphere.
While our nation is 
not currently pushing 
the construction of new 
reactors, nuclear research 
has experienced its own 
renaissance in recent years. 
New types of reactors are 
under development, some 
of which may alleviate the 
drawbacks of contemporary 
nuclear plants. For example, 
pebble bed and traveling 
wave reactors may ameliorate 
safety concerns surrounding 
20th century reactor designs.
And then there are Small 
Modular Reactors (SMRs). 
While nuclear power provides 
cheap energy over a long 
period of time — due to the 
high energy density of the 
fuel — the startup cost of 
building a full sized plant is 
too high for most companies 
to shell out. SMRs are smaller 
reactors that can be built for a 
signi?cantly smaller up-front 
cost than traditional nuclear 
power plants. While still in 
development, these reactors 
could be implemented across 
the country for a relatively 
low construction cost, each 
providing cheap energy to 
neighborhoods rather than 
cities. But such technology 
raises another concern: do 
we truly wish to have a small 
nuclear reactor as a neighbor?
Nuclear power remains 
a very dif?cult subject. The 
general disregard of nuclear 
power as a dangerous and 
infeasible source of power 
seems to be misguided, and 
nuclear energy — particularly 
with the advent of modern 
reactor designs — is a solution 
worth serious consideration. 
As scientists, we must commu-
nicate the true complexities of 
nuclear power to the populace 
so that we, the citizens, can 
rationally decide if it is time 
to make amends with the all-
powerful atom.
What happened to nuclear power?

Researchers at the Salk 
Institute for Biological 
Studies have created human-
pig hybrid embryos by insert-
ing human stem cells into 
existing pig embryos. The 
human cells not only sur-
vived the implantation, but 
grew and began to develop 
into tissues in vivo — an im-
portant step toward growing 
human organs inside animals 
to provide much-needed 
transplants.
The researchers, led by Dr. 
Jun Wu, intended to discover 
whether human cells could 
survive in a gestating animal 
embryo. The human cells 
used for this experiment were 
induced pleuripotent stem 
cells — adult human cells that 
have been genetically altered 
to have the characteristics of 
embryonic stem cells. The 
stem cells were inserted into 
pig and cow embryos, all of 
which survived the insertion 
process. Next, the altered pig 
embryos were implanted into 
pigs and allowed to incubate. 
The human cells successfully 
incorporated themselves into 
the developing embryos with 
modestly low rejection rates, 
and had begun to develop 
into specialized tissues when 
the test was terminated at 
four weeks into gestation.
Growing 
human organs 
inside animals 
could alleviate 
the need for 
human donors.
This is the latest in a se-
ries of experiments produc-
ing interspecies chimeras 
— organisms with DNA 
from more than one species. 
One well-known procedure 
in this ?eld involves breed-
ing mice that lack pancre-
ases. Rat stem cells are then 
used to grow rat pancreases 
inside the mice. The Salk 
researchers recreated this 
experiment at the embryonic 
stage as a precursor to 
their pig experiment, us-
ing rat stem cells to grow 
pancreases, hearts, and eyes 
inside mouse embryos. The 
rat stem cells also contrib-
uted to the development of 
the mouse gallbladders — an 
interesting ?nding, as rats do 
not have gallbladders. The rat 
components did not appear 
to signi?cantly impact the 
health or lifespan of the mice 
in the experiment, which is 
positive news for scientists 
hoping to explore the medical 
implications of this study.
Research on interspecies 
chimeras has great medical 
signi?cance because it could 
lead to a reliable supply 
of transplantable human 
organs. 
Over 100,000 Americans 
are currently waiting to 
receive donated organs, a 
number that has increased 
dramatically over the past 
few decades as transplants 
have become safer and more 
reliable. Unfortunately, the 
number of organ donors 
has remained relatively 
unchanged. Growing human 
organs inside animals 
could alleviate the need for 
human donors — and if the 
incubated organs were grown 
from the stem cells of the 
intended recipient, it could 
signi?cantly lower the risk of 
transplant rejection as well.
Considerations 
like these raise 
questions of 
animal rights 
and “violation 
of the order of 
nature.”
- Göran Hermerén
Medical Ethicist
Studies on chimeras are 
fraught with ethical concerns. 
Though human-animal chi-
meras have been used for 
medical research for decades 
without issue, these earlier 
chimeras were created by in-
serting human cells late in 
the animal’s development, 
when most or all tissue func-
tions have already been 
determined. When human 
cells are incorporated into 
an embryo, as in many recent 
studies, the researchers have 
considerably less control over 
what happens to those cells, 
or what they develop into. 
Ethicists are concerned 
that human genes may end 
up in the animal’s brain 
cells or gametes, leading to 
heightened sentience and 
intelligence, or the possibility 
of producing offspring. Con-
siderations like these raise 
questions of animal rights 
and “violation of the order of 
nature,” according to medical 
ethicist Göran Hermerén.
Because of these ethical 
complications, the National 
Institute of Health (NIH) 
temporarily halted funding 
for human-animal chimera 
research in 2015. (The Salk 
Institute chimera research 
was privately funded.) 
Carrie Wolinetz, the NIH’s 
associate director for science 
policy, asserts that chimera 
research will be encouraged 
to continue when there is 
“an appropriate oversight 
system so we can make sure 
it is proceeding responsibly.” 
However, it is unclear what 
“ethical responsibility” means 
for this kind of research.
The Salk research did 
not violate any current ethi-
cal guidelines, but it will be 
necessary to reevaluate such 
guidelines in light of the 
enormous bene?t this re-
search could bring to patients 
in need.

HOW THINGS WORK
Water puri?cation and PWSA
With a simple turn of a 
handle, you have access to 
clean water. And, as resi-
dents of Pittsburgh have dis-
covered in the past week, the 
cleanliness of water dramati-
cally affects one’s quality of 
life.
Access to clean water is 
vital for the survival of in-
dividuals and communities. 
In July 2010, the United 
Nations General Assembly 
acknowledged the human 
right to water and sanitation 
through Resolution 64/292. 
In Nov. 2002, the United 
Nations Committee on Eco-
nomic, Social, and Cultural 
Rights adopted General 
Comment No. 15, in which 
Article I.1 states: “The hu-
man right to water is indis-
pensable for leading a life in 
human dignity. It is a prereq-
uisite for the realization of 
other human rights.” 
By some accounts, efforts 
to obtain clean drinking wa-
ter date back even prior to 
the discovery of fire. Ancient 
people relied on taste to tell 
if water was clean, which is 
actually not a viable method. 
In one of the earliest docu-
mentations dating back to 
the 15th century, archaeolo-
gists found Sanskrit writings 
in ancient Egyptian tombs 
depicting water treatment. 
In the Sus’ruta Samhita, 
from 2000 BCE, there are 
a number of different wa-
ter treatment methods de-
scribed, including boiling 
and heating water, filtering 
through gravel and sand, 
and dipping hot iron into it. 
In terms of water 
distribution, the earliest ac-
count of piping dates back 
to 3000 BCE, with Mesopo-
tamia’s baked clay pipes, 
China’s bamboo pipes and 
Egypt’s copper sheets that 
were hammered into cylin-
ders, all of which were used 
to transport water. In 400 
BCE, Rome’s aqueduct sys-
tem carried water through-
out the entire city.
Pittsburgh as a city was 
established a little more 
recently than Rome, in 1816. 
Before the public water sup-
ply began in 1802 with the 
digging of four 47-foot wells, 
residents relied on river wa-
ter. As the population grew, 
it became necessary to ex-
pand the water distribu-
tion, and the city built sev-
eral pumping stations that 
pumped water directly from 
the rivers with no purifica-
tion. By the end of the 19th 
century, however, the river 
water had become too con-
taminated and scientists had 
found evidence that drink-
ing impure water could neg-
atively affect health through 
waterborne diseases such as 
cholera and typhoid fever.
Thus, by 1905, con-
struction began on plants 
that implemented slow 
sand filtration (SSF). SSF 
is a technique in which 
contaminated freshwater 
(river water, in Pittsburgh’s 
case) flows into a reservoir 
and through a layer of sand, 
where it is both physically 
filtered and biologically 
treated to remove pathogens 
and sediments. 
The key difference be-
tween SSF and rapid sand 
filtration (RSF), apart from 
the speed at which the wa-
ter is filtered, is the fact that 
SSF is primarily biological 
while RSP is primarily physi-
cal. In SSF, a microbial com-
munity known as the “sch-
mutzdecke” is established on 
the top layer of sand, causing 
the top layer to be biologi-
cally active. These predatory 
bacteria, which generally 
come from the source water, 
feed on microbes from the 
water that pass through the 
SSF, which is particularly ef-
fective in removing bacteria, 
viruses and heavy metals, 
but is not effective in remov-
ing chemicals. 
In 1911, the city began us-
ing chlorine as an additional 
disinfectant. Chlorination of 
water is the most commonly 
used method of killing mi-
croorganisms in freshwater. 
According to the Center 
for Disease Control and 
Prevention, chlorine levels 
of up to four milligrams per 
liter are considered safe in 
drinking water. 
At this level, chlorine is 
effective against pathogenic 
bacteria, but not strong 
enough to kill all viruses, 
cysts and worms. However, 
combined with filtration, it 
is effective at disinfecting 
water supplies. 
By the second half of the 
20th century, the SSF system 
had aged and an upgrade to 
the water purification system 
occurred in two stages. First, 
a clarifier pretreatment 
station was constructed in 
1962 to chemically treat 
freshwater and remove iron, 
manganese, tastes, odors, 
and colors from the water 
before it reached filtration. 
Second, the SSF stations 
were replaced with RSF sta-
tions in 1969.
In 1984, the Pitts-
burgh Water and Sewage 
Authority (PWSA) was 
officially formed, taking 
charge of maintenance 
and construction of all 
water distribution systems 
in Pittsburgh. According 
to their website, PWSA’s 
vision is “to provide water 
and wastewater services 
that meet or exceed all 
regulations and customer 
expectations at the lowest 
possible cost.”
Last week, on Jan. 31, 
the Pittsburgh Water and 
Sewage Authority issued 
a precautionary flush and 
boil water advisory for resi-
dents of Pittsburgh. When 
testing near a Highland 
Park water filtration plant, 
some tests showed that 
the treated drinking water 
had levels of chlorine that 
were below regulation of 
the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Environment (DEP); 
there was a risk that the 
treated drinking water still 
contained microorganisms. 
Later that day, the 
PWSA issued another state-
ment saying they took the 
Highland Park plant out of 
service and added chlorine 
to the water to maintain DEP 
regulations.
On Feb. 2, the PWSA lifted 
the precautionary flush 
and boil water advisory, 
confirming that there was 
no longer a risk to the drink-
ing water supply. Although 
the entire affair only took 
place over the course of a 
few days, it brings a sharp 
reminder that access to clean 
water is as much a privilege 
as it is a right.

Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team faced sixth-
ranked Washington University 
on the road Friday night in St. 
Louis, Missouri. The Tartans 
fell 93–80 to the Bears and are 
now 10–9 overall and 4–4 in 
the University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA).
Senior Jack Serbin hit the 
game’s opening bucket with a 
jumper off the glass and the 
Tartans later held an 11–10 
lead after a fastbreak layup by 
junior Ryan Maha with 14:08 
showing on the clock. Four 
minutes later, the Tartans 
trailed 17–16 after a driving 
layup by ?rst-year Colin Mc-
Neil.
The Bears then scored sev-
en straight and after two free 
throws by McNeil, watched as 
a three-pointer went through 
the net at the shot clock buzz-
er to push their lead to 26–18.
The lead grew to 16 points 
by the end of the half with 
the Bears scoring the ?nal 
?ve points following a pair of 
free throws by senior James 
Ormond.
The Tartans shot 40.7 per-
cent from the ?eld but sur-
rendered 65.4 percent to the 
Bears on the defensive end for 
the half.
McNeil led the Tartans 
with 10 points at the break as 
Serbin and senior Chris Shkil 
were each saddled with foul 
trouble and held to four points 
apiece.
An 8–2 run for the Tartans 
to start the second half cut 
the de?cit to 10 points after a 
three-pointer by Maha from 
the top of the key.
The Tartans pulled to with-
in six points three times with 
half the period still to play but 
the Bears methodically ran 
their lead back to 13 on two 
shots from the foul line with 
6:12 left to go.
A jumper by Serbin with 
one minute to play saw the 
Tartans trail 87–80 but four 
free throws sandwiched a 
layup and the Bears went on 
for the 93–80 home victory.
Serbin led ?ve players in 
double ?gures with 18 points 
while Maha dropped in 15 
points. Shkil followed with 13 
points, as McNeil ?nished with 
12 and ?rst-year Zach How-
arth scored 11. Serbin and 
Shkil each pulled down eight 
rebounds.
The Bears were led by 
Andrew Sanders who ?n-
ished with 26 points and 10 
rebounds. Kevin Kucera re-
corded a double–double with 
10 points and 10 assists while 
Matt Highsmith contributed 
18 points off the bench.
The Tartans will next face 
Brandeis University at home 
on Friday, Feb. 10.
Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s basketball team traveled 
to St. Louis, Missouri, to face 
the Washington University 
Bears on Friday, Feb. 3. The 
Bears, ranked ninth in the 
nation by D3hoops.com, de-
fended their home court with 
a 79–69 victory over the 20th-
ranked Tartans. The Tartans 
are now 15–4 overall and 4–4 
in the UAA.
Senior Lisa Murphy led the 
Tartans with her 14th double–
double of the season with 21 
points and 12 rebounds. First-
year Makayla Filiere scored 15 
points for the Tartans while 
senior Jackie Hudepohl re-
bounded from a scoreless ?rst 
half to tally 12 points for the 
game.
The Tartans trailed 22–19 
at the end of the ?rst period, as 
Murphy led with nine points. 
The Bears hit ?ve shots from 
behind the arc and grabbed 
twice as many rebounds, in-
cluding six on the offensive 
end to record seven second–
chance points.
The Bears opened the 
second quarter with a three–
pointer, and built a 30–19 lead 
before Murphy converted a 
layup off a feed to the post by 
Hudepohl with 6:47 showing 
on the clock.
Another 2:42 ticked off the 
clock before the Tartans scored 
again on a put–back layup by 
?rst-year Laurel Pereira. The 
Bears built an 18-point lead up 
until that basket and went on 
to lead 45–27 at the break.
The Tartans, who shot 53.8 
percent in the ?rst quarter, 
dropped to 35.7 percent for 
the half, while the Bears con-
nected on 46.3 percent of their 
attempts.
Four three-pointers by the 
Tartans in the third quarter 
helped the visitors cut the de?-
cit to 10 points but a four-point 
run to close the quarter gave 
the Bears a 59–45 advantage.
Back-to-back three-
pointers by Filiere brought the 
Tartans back within 10 points, 
73–63, with 3:36 to play. 
Following a Bear turnover, 
Hudepohl drained a baseline 
jumper to make the de?cit 
eight but the Bears responded 
with two buckets inside and 
went on for the 79–69 win.
The Tartans will next play 
Brandeis University on Friday, 
Feb. 10.

Mary St. John aims for spot in swimming championshipMike Rozenvasser ready to ?nish rookie season strong
IAN TANAYA
Sports Editor
“Whatever work I put in, I 
get out directly.”
This is how junior math-
ematical sciences major Mary 
St. John describes why she 
has stuck with swimming 
since she was ?rst drawn to 
the sport at age three. It de-
?nes her involvement in the 
Carnegie Mellon Swimming 
and Diving team, putting her 
utmost effort into preparation 
for her races and cheering 
on her teammates when the 
matches are over. It equally 
applies to her efforts in the 
classroom, preparing for a 
career she believes will help 
make a considerable impact.
St. John readily admits 
that she’s the type of person 
who has always been in the 
world of sports, owing this to 
the in?uence of her brother 
and her father. Always look-
ing up to her brother, she took 
up swimming and was imme-
diately drawn to the fact that 
she was in full control of how 
far she could go in a mostly 
individual sport with a team 
aspect. While St. John took 
up other sports including ?eld 
hockey, soccer, and diving, 
she ultimately chose to stick 
with swimming. “I’m de?nite-
ly a stronger swimmer,” she 
said when asked if she had 
considered diving at Carnegie 
Mellon. “It was a stretch to 
think about doing both. Be-
sides, practices con?ict, so I 
understand why I couldn’t.”
When asked about why she 
was drawn to Carnegie Mel-
lon, St. John emphasized the 
desire for balance in her life. 
“I wanted a school that was in 
a city so there would be other 
things to do outside of cam-
pus. Pittsburgh was a good 
balance, and Carnegie Mellon 
had a good balance between 
strong academics and a swim 
program I wanted.” She also 
mentioned her interest in 
the School of Drama, saying 
she was “excited to see what 
shows they could put on.”
It’s also extremely clear 
that her passion and deter-
mination has driven her in 
day-to-day life. “We have 
5:30 practice. I pack food for 
before and after. Snacks are 
key. They get me through 
practice and academics.” Her 
daily routine lays the founda-
tion for her performances at 
meets, and the results show. 
In the 2015–16 season, St. 
John ?nished ?rst on the team 
in the 200-yard butter?y, 200-
yard Individual Medley, and 
400-yard IM, making the All-
University Athletic Associa-
tion (UAA) third team for the 
butter?y.
Her proudest accomplish-
ment with the sport comes 
from her performance in the 
2016 UAA Championships. 
Though she did not perform 
to her expectations on the 
?rst two days, she persevered 
and ended up ?nishing in ?rst 
for the 200-yard butter?y. “I 
think it was really important 
to ?nish strong.”
Thinking about the future, 
St. John mentioned wanting 
to go into data science and 
speci?cally for the govern-
ment. “My grandfather was 
an aeronautical engineer for 
NASA, which seemed cool to 
me even though I didn’t want 
to be an engineer. I want to 
make a big impact with sta-
tistical analysis, not just make 
people money.”
For now, St. John is 
focused on the upcoming 
UAA Championships. “I hope 
to swim really fast and get in-
vited to nationals.”
St. John will next swim 
with the Tartan women at 
the UAA Championships from 
Wednesday, Feb. 8 to Satur-
day, Feb. 11.

Plaidie Daddies become Tartan fantasy league champs
IAN TANAYA
Sports Editor
Here we are with the ?nal 
recap of the Tartan II’s ?rst 
season of fantasy football. 
Previously, Editor-in-Chief 
India Price’s Plaidie Daddies 
upset Zeke Rosenberg’s heav-
ily favored DeMarco DePolo to 
make it to the fantasy cham-
pionships while my Dream-
land Warriors came back from 
behind to squeak past Publish-
er Jade Crockem’s Mr. Rodg-
ers’ Neighborhood.
In the end, the Plaidie 
Daddies defeated my Dream-
land Warriors 202–200 to 
become our league champi-
ons. After all, how could a 
team with a name like that not 
win?
I remember way back in 
Week 4 when Price told me 
that she just planned on let-
ting the roster she drafted 
just go at it without making 
any changes, despite having a 
kicker who didn’t play and a 
defense that frequently scored 
negative points. I encouraged 
her to make changes since 
growth is essential in fan-
tasy football. I lost that week 
107–104, a precursor to Price’s 
championship run. 
Though I had built up 
a 117–98 lead in Week 16 
thanks to New Orleans Saints 
quarterback Drew Brees, Buf-
falo Bills running back LeSean 
McCoy, and New York Giants 
wide receiver Beckham, it just 
wasn’t enough. Bills quarter-
back Tyrod Taylor, Atlanta Fal-
cons kicker Matt Bryant, and 
New England Patriots running 
back LeGarrette Blount kept 
her team a?oat and within a 
realistic chance of making a 
comeback.
My team collapsed in Week 
17 courtesy of an injury to Mc-
Coy, a de?ated Oakland team 
that left Oakland Raiders run-
ning back Murray no room to 
run, and my impatience with 
Arizona Cardinals wide re-
ceiver Fitzgerald, who scored 
15 points when I put in Bears 
wide receiver Alshon Jeffery 
and got two on the board in-
stead. Brees and New York 
Jets running back Bilal Powell 
were the only two players on 
my team who scored double 
digits, compared to four play-
ers on Price’s team.
While Brees’ last drive 
against the Falcons gave me 
a 10-point lead heading into 
the ?nal game between the 
Packers and Lions, three late 
passes to Detroit tight end Eric 
Ebron sealed the victory for 
the Plaidie Daddies.
Congratulations to Price. 
And f*** you, Zach Ertz. You 
do nothing for me before I 
cut you and pick up Tenne-
see Titans tight end Delanie 
Walker, and now you score 38 
points against me. Ugh.
In a third-place match that 
could have easily been the 
?nal, Crockem’s team man-
aged to overcome Rosenberg 
in a matchup that was close 
from start to ?nish. In Week 
16, Rosenberg’s DeMarco 
DePolo escaped with a slim 
127–124 lead. His wide re-
ceivers were critical to his 
success as Green Bay Packers 
wide receiver Jordy Nelson 
scored 36 points, Pittsburgh 
Steelers wide receiver Antonio 
Brown earned 25, and Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers wide receiver 
Mike Evans totaled 22. The 
lone miscue Rosenberg made 
was his decision to start the 
Bills defense, a move which 
made him four points worse 
off than not having any de-
fense at all.
For Crockem, Packers quar-
terback Aaron Rodgers and 
Dallas Cowboys running back 
Ezekiel Elliot helped keep her 
team within striking distance 
of DeMarco DePolo, essen-
tially setting up Week 17 as a 
winner take all matchup.
The Bills defense that 
scored -4 points in Week 16 
came back to haunt Rosenberg 
in Week 17. Crockem emerged 
victorious after tallying 124 
points compared to Rosen-
berg’s 117.
The three players in Mr. 
Rodgers’ Neighborhood who 
scored three points or fewer 
were more than balanced out 
by standout performances 
from Rodgers, Saints wide 
receiver Michael Thomas, and 
Packers wide receiver Devante 
Adams.
While Patriots wide receiv-
er Julian Edelman and Falcons 
quarterback Matt Ryan kept 
Rosenberg in contention, the 
goose egg from the Bills de-
fense could not make up for 
the negative output the previ-
ous week, which turned out 
to be the difference in this ex-
tremely tight matchup.
In a league and game where 
Pillbox Co-Editor Sinead Foley 
has no idea what is going on, 
she still managed to ?nish in 
?fth place after overcoming 
a 100–90 de?cit against Lay-
out Manager Abhishek Tayal’s 
Loquacious Losers.
Without much to play for, 
both teams settled for the play-
ers they had set previously, re-
sulting in three zero point per-
formances across the teams. 
Still, Tayal looked like he 
might have had the edge con-
sidering the performances of 
Steelers running back Le’Veon 
Bell, Kansas City Chiefs quar-
terback Alex Smith, and Gi-
ants wide receiver Sterling 
Shepard. However, Cardinals 
running back David Johnson 
and San Diego Chargers tight 
end Antonio Gates kept Foley’s 
team a?oat heading into the 
last week of play.
Not switching up the roster 
ended up proving to be more 
costly for Tayal than Foley, as 
he had three players put up 
zero points compared to only 
Dolphins quarterback Ryan 
Tannehill on Foley’s team.
The high scoring players 
Tayal had were on teams that 
wanted to rest their stars for 
the playoffs, resulting in a 
98–73 score that put Foley in 
the ?nal spot of the top half of 
the league.
Despite its name, Alex 
Wood’s extremely trash team 
wasn’t actually that bad, just 
not given enough home run 
hitters from the waiver wire to 
keep its strong post draft sta-
tus. Despite the losses the team 
had this year, Wood clearly 
dominated Lula Beresford’s 
rookie team.
In Week 16, the extreme-
ly trash team outscored 
Beresford’s team 145–67. 
Wood received great perfor-
mances from Chiefs tight end 
Travis Kelce, Cowboys wide 
receiver Dez Bryant, and 
Saints running back Mark In-
gram while Beresford started 
two injured players who to-
taled zero points.
Without any outstand-
ing performances to keep her 
team a?oat, she found herself 
in a 78-point hole.
Despite a sizable reversal 
of fortune that gave Beresford 
116 points in Week 17 com-
pared to Wood’s 81, it wasn’t 
nearly enough to overcome 
the previous week’s de?cit.
Wood’s team had several 
players resting for the ac-
tual playoffs while Beresford 
called on Patriots quarterback 
Tom Brady, Steelers running 
back DeAngelo Williams, and 
Minnesota Vikings tight end 
Kyle Rudolph.
Finishing in eighth place is 
certainly not fun, but that’s to 
be expected from a ?rst time 
player with less knowledge 
of the game than the compe-
tition (not everyone can be 
India and Jade). Finishing in 
seventh place despite a deep 
knowledge of football, how-
ever, must be frustrating for 
Wood, who will hopefully 
have better luck the next time 
he takes part in fantasy.
This was a statement game 
for Sarah Gutekunst, one to 
prove that her team was not 
so bad that it would fall below 
Foley’s second, less observed 
team. McManus’s Anus won 
in convincing fashion, start-
ing with a 115–75 result in 
Week 16. Seattle Seahawks 
quarterback Russell Wilson 
led the team with 33 points, 
and three other players on her 
roster scored double digits. 
By contrast, Titans quarter-
back Marcus Mariota left his 
game injured, and the Denver 
Broncos defense yielded -4 
points.
The ?nal week of play 
closely resembled Week 16: 
Gutekunst scored 110 points 
compared to Foley’s 77.
Carolina Panthers wide 
receiver Kelvin Benjamin, 
Cleveland Browns wide re-
ceiver Terrelle Pryor, Browns 
tight end Gary Barnidge, and 
the Philadelphia Eagles de-
fense gave good performanc-
es, while three players gave 
Foley zero points.
Strangely, Broncos kicker 
Brandon McManus sat on the 
bench during this matchup, 
despite being the inspiration 
for the team name and being 
Gutekunst’s favorite player 
last year. Evidently, she’s 
chosen to move on from him, 
which makes sense given her 
team’s close to dead last ?nish.
If you ever decide to play 
fantasy again Sarah, I de?-
nitely wish you better luck 
than you had this year. At least 
you’ve got The Bachelor.

After placing fourth in the 
national Intercollegiate Ten-
nis Association (ITA) Oracle 
Cup last fall as the ?rst ?rst-
year from Carnegie Mellon to 
play in the tournament, Mike 
Rozenvasser is gearing up for 
the second half of his impres-
sive rookie season.
From Haworth, N.J., 
Rozenvasser’s tennis career 
began at a young age, when 
his grandfather put a racket in 
his hand and taught him how 
to play. He also followed his 
brother’s footsteps and played 
soccer up until his ?rst year 
of high school, when he had 
to choose between tennis and 
soccer.
“You don’t depend on 
your team – it’s an individual 
sport,” he said about why 
he chose tennis over soccer. 
“When you win, it’s the best 
feeling because you did it all 
by yourself, but when you 
lose, you did it all by yourself 
too. It’s all based on yourself 
and depends on how hard you 
want to work to succeed.”
Playing tennis at a colle-
giate level was never in ques-
tion. “Giving it up in college 
would not even be plausible,” 
he said. Carnegie Mellon is 
the perfect ?t for him. The 
coaches were very inviting 
during his visit to campus, 
and the players all said, “This 
place is awesome.” He could 
have played at a Division I 
school, but there, tennis is 
?rst and then academics. “Ac-
ademics are more important 
[to me] than sports.”
In Rozenvasser’s ?rst year 
at Carnegie Mellon it has been 
challenging to balance aca-
demics and tennis. “It’s a lot 
harder than high school,” he 
said, emphasizing the impor-
tance of time management. 
He is an Economics major, 
with both his parents and his 
brother in the ?nance ?eld. 
While he isn’t positive on 
what career track he wants to 
pursue, he plans on working 
in the business industry. 
But tennis is still what he’s 
concentrating on. He plans 
to “keep on playing for four 
years,” but hasn’t thought 
about continuing out of 
college.
Though he intends on play-
ing in some tournaments over 
the summer for fun, he wants 
to focus on things other than 
tennis after he graduates. “I’ll 
keep on playing, but nothing 
too serious.”
Off the court, Rozenvasser 
likes to go to the gym. “I like 
being physically active. If 
you’re physically healthy, 
you can be healthy in other 
aspects of your life,” he said. 
However, his mental tough-
ness comes ?rst when he’s 
playing tennis. “Mental and 
physical, they go hand in 
hand,” he said. “The more I’m 
in physical shape, the more 
con?dent I am.” But when 
he’s on the court, he’s always 
in his head. “I’m always yell-
ing ‘Come on! Come on!’ I can 
be down Love-40, and it keeps 
me motivated and pumped 
up. There’s always a way to 
win.”
Though he prefers playing 
singles, doubles has grown on 
him at his time at Carnegie 
Mellon. “I’ve started playing 
with Kenny Zheng, a senior, a 
big mentor. Winning together 
is super fun, and the energy 
goes up through the roof.”
Though his ultimate goal 
is to win an NCAA Champi-
onship with the team and 
individually, Rozenvasser is 
excited for the indoor sea-
son moving forward. Though 
the men’s tennis team didn’t 
start off the way they wanted, 
he feels they can come back, 
and that they have the talent 
and the strong work ethic to 
succeed. 
The Tartans will continue 
their season this Saturday, 
Feb. 11, against Walsh Univer-
sity and St. Francis University.

3Advice for Awkward People: Superbowl blues

---------------------------------------------------

Jade Crockem | PublisherAdvice for Awkward People
On the price we pay for free snacks 
Dear Jade,
I did it. I made it through Super Bowl Sunday. 
It took a lot of guac shoved forcefully into my 
mouth to avoid making conversation, but I made it 
through with my social status relatively intact and 
a new reputation as a chapion guac eater. Alas, it 
doesn’t really matter. The relentless sports season 
calendar marches on, and I’ll be facing baseball 
season soon enough. (shudders)
See, the thing is, I am absolutely hopeless when 
it comes to sports. Football, soccer, basketball, 
hockey … you name it, I don’t get it. I’ve had 
the rules explained a hundred times. I still have 
absolutely no idea what’s going on on the field. I 
can’t even spot the ball 90 percent of the time. 
Friends ask me out to sports bars to “watch the 
game.” (What game? What sport are they even 
talking about? What is the code that clues me in to 
which game is “the” game?) The boyfriend wants 
to stay in on Sunday to watch football. And then 
there are the dreaded high holy days of sports: 
the Stanley Cup, the World Series, and the Super 
Bowl. Sports are suddenly everywhere in my life! 
This is the kind of thing I came to Carnegie Mellon 
to avoid! How do I fake my way through these 
social events? I don’t want people to know I don’t 
know what’s going on and feel like they need to 
teach me for the thousandth time, or, worse, think 
I’m bored and not invite me next time. I love the 
chips and dip too much for that!
Please teach me how to be a pretend sports fan.
Sincerely,
Sadly People Overly React to Sports
Dear SPORTS,
First of all I’d like to say: CELEBRITY SHOT! I’m 
standing in for Sarah this week, but I’m sure I’ll be 
able to help you out. I understand your troubles. It 
can be hard to be out of the loop when everyone 
seems to be fluent in a lingo that you have no idea 
about (pretty much me whenever someone talks 
about baseball). But, there are ways to overcome 
these troubles!
My boyfriend experienced a similar issue. 
Everyone would ask him about football and to 
deter attention, he used to say that his favorite 
team was the arguably most hated team in the 
NFL, the Cleveland Browns. After a while, he 
started to acquire an actual interest in this team. It 
did kind of backfire in his case, because he ended 
up being an actual fan of the actual worst team 
in the NFL, but I think that’s the whole reason it 
worked. He picked the worst team and so no one 
ever wanted to talk to him about football.
Try finding an unpopular team from each sport, 
and when you say that’s your team, everyone will 
be so filled with disgust that they’ll never ask you 
about sports again! They’ll still invite you to watch 
parties because they’ll be able to see that you 
clearly have an interest in sports.
But you should also maybe try giving sports an 
honest try. My dad always said that one good 
thing about sports is that they could make an 
awkward conversation a lot less awkward. Say 
you see a recruiter at EncompassCMU wearing 
a Steelers hat. Mention their performance this 
season and you’ve already got an icebreaker! 
For some reason, people think that other people 
who like the same sports teams as them must be 
good people, so the recruiter will automatically 
think you’re trustworthy and have a good sense 
of judgment.
Sports can also be genuinely fun to engage in 
if you love smack talk and making fun of other 
people’s opinions. I’d really give it a try sometime 
because you might be surprised how exciting you 
find sports when you end up rooting for a team 
that you’ve invested a lot of years in.
Love,
Jade Crockem

Exploring Lawrenceville and Greek cuisine  
A Friday night out with friends in the city is always 
a good time, especially if you decide to explore 
an area you’ve never visited before. My friends 
and I did just that when we ventured over to the 
hip neighborhood of Lawrenceville, which is not 
too far from campus, just a short ride on a 54 from 
Craig St. The place is very easy to get around, 
with little cafés here and there, along with a few 
vintage stores and cool hangout spots. My friends 
and I were looking for a place to get dinner when 
we stumbled upon a Greek restaurant called 
Pastitsio. It was a small place, but with a classy 
and comfortable setup. Friends and couples were 
sat at the tables around to us, all socializing and 
having a good time. The entire restaurant gave off 
a good vibe.
When our very cordial waiter came to give us 
our menus, he went through all of the meals in 
each category of the menu to describe their flavor 
and how everything was cooked. I specifically 
appreciated having the option of choosing 
between the lunch or dinner versions of each meal, 
the only difference being the prices, and option 
to order two sides instead of one for the dinner 
portion. After the waiter finished showing us our 
meal options, my friends and I carefully selected 
our order, which took only 15 minutes to reach us.
First came the appetizers: hummus and pita bread, 
Greek meatballs, and spanakopita. My friends 
and I really enjoyed the hummus, which had this 
meaty texture to it that paired deliciously with the 
warm pita bread. The meatballs were actually 
complimentary for the restaurant’s happy hour, 
and were served with tzatziki sauce along with 
another spicy sauce. The spanakopita, however, 
was probably our favorite appetizer — small 
squares of spinach and feta cheese wrapped in 
flaky phyllo dough. The combination of the fresh 
and tangy, along with some herbs mixed in, went 
so well together. 
When my friends and I got to our main courses, 
we were just as satisfied with the taste and 
presentation. A few of us ordered the lamb 
souvlakia, marinated pieces of lamb and rice, 
while others ordered the roasted vegetable pita 
and pastitsio, a sweet casserole made with beef 
and noodles. Everything was presented nicely 
on white glass plates and the vibrant colors of 
the ingredients in each dish made the entire 
presentation very pleasing to look at.
All of our meals were seasoned perfectly and 
tasted very unique. Some of them had lightly salty 
and sour flavors. Even the water tasted great (I 
think they put mint or something similar in it). Not 
to mention, we were told that all the food was 
made with the freshest ingredients. My friends 
and I all enjoyed the entire experience of eating 
at Pastitsio, where we were able to both explore 
more of a food culture and catch up with each 
other at the same time.

Piada Italian Street Food
Finally, a new option in Oakland
Piada Italian Street Food, which opened on Forbes 
Avenue on Jan. 16, is surrounded by many dif-
ferent restaurants, ranging from Pittsburgh icon 
Primanti Bros. to the ubiquitous McDonald’s. 
Originally from Ohio, this is the chain’s first 
Pennsylvanian establishment, with other expan-
sions in Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, Kentucky, 
and Texas. Walking into the restaurant there is 
an immediate contemporary feel, with a minimal-
ist black and white palette, metal accents, and 
dim lighting that screams young and modern. The 
space is divided into sections with three different 
types of seating: bar style, high table, and classic 
table. The wide mirrors, white-painted brick walls, 
and large photography posters create an atmo-
sphere of stylish sophistication that lures in the hip 
college crowd but also attracts the families look-
ing for a trendy night out at a place that’s neither 
fancy nor fast-food.
Seeking to stand out in the sea of Italian restau-
rants, Piada Italian Street Food has created a 
casual, Italian, “Chipotle-style” restaurant, with 
an assembly line where customers can watch their 
food being made. Though the line is long during 
the dinner rush hour, it’s swift, and customers are 
served quickly. Piada Italian Street Food offers 
a variety of grill items to choose from to add to 
entrées, such as chicken, calamari, salmon, and 
vegetables. With the assembly line, we can see 
exactly what we’re ordering. The servers are 
friendly and efficient, answering questions about 
both the restaurant and the food itself. Sticking to 
a healthier menu, Piada Italian Street Food special-
izes in piada, an Italian flatbread originating from 
the Romagna region in northern Italy. They also 
offer a variety of pastas, salads, soups, and sides.
The Farm Club Tasca is delicious. A piada flat-
bread sandwich concoction, it’s made with fried 
chicken and pancetta topped with sliced avocado, 
fresh bruschetta tomatoes, arugula, and lemon 
basil dressing that contrasts the sweet and spicy 
pickles and spicy balsamic aioli. At the first taste, 
the diversity of ingredients explodes into different 
flavors. “I’m a fan,” a friend said.
The Basil Pesto Pasta, topped with a large grass-
fed meatball, is also very good. The angel hair 
pasta itself is of high quality, the fresh basil pesto 
fragrant and savory, and the sundried tomatoes 
simultaneously sweet and spicy. The meatball is 
tender, its distinct sweet taste setting it apart from 
the standard store-bought meatball. However, with 
both parmesan alfredo and freshly grated parme-
san, the cheese takes away from the basil pesto 
and the collective taste of the pasta, and could be 
a little less creamy.
The Chef’s Favorite Piada, however, is a slight dis-
appointment. Though the rolled flatbread contains 
romaine lettuce, sweet and spicy peppers, mozza-
rella, and fresh parmesan, the spicy diavolo sauce 
overpowers everything else. With too much sauce, 
the entrée is on the saltier side and becomes one-
dimensional, a far cry from the many balanced 
flavors of the Farm Club Tasca.
Overall, the food is good and made with fresh 
ingredients, resulting in a relatively authentic 
Italian palette. Though some dishes are not per-
fect, the visual aesthetic and the design of the 
restaurant really help to create a welcoming space 
for all different types of customers. Piada Italian 
Street Food has the perfect location in Oakland, at 
the heart the University of Pittsburgh and neighbor-
ing Carnegie Mellon. While seated, I noticed that 
nearly everyone else in the restaurant was also a 
student, coming in after their last class of the day, 
ready for a nice meal and to catch up with friends. 
Beyond the novelty of a new restaurant near 
campus, Piada Italian Street Food succeeds in an 
aspect of dining beyond the food itself. It has cre-
ated a space for people to relax, hang out, and 
enjoy their food in peace.

Lohri Festival 
A magnificent fire and the spirit of centuries 
of tradition come together at the Punjabi folk 
festival entitled Lohri. Traditionally, Lohri is 
celebrated around the time of the Winter 
Solstice, and brings with it warmth to pull 
Northern Indians through the rest of the bit-
ter winter cold. The lighting of the bonfire 
symbolizes the promise of longer days to 
come, and makes the celebration an ideal time 
for families and friends to come together.
OM, the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain spirituality 
group on campus, spends a night every 
January giving students at Carnegie Mellon 
the opportunity to engage in the warmth that 
is Lohri. This year, the celebration was held 
on Friday, Feb. 3, behind Stever House on 
Morewood Avenue.
To raise awareness and advertise the event, 
OM hosted a photo contest, where participants 
were challenged to snap “Pics with Punjabis” 
around campus. Punjabis themselves were not 
allowed to participate, except as the Punjabi of 
another in a selfie, but prizes were distributed 
for both the non-Punjabis with the most selfies, 
and the most captured Punjabi on campus.
During a typical Lohri celebration in India, 
items are thrown into a bonfire. Most often this 
includes snacks made from sesame seeds and 
jaggery, called “chikki,” and a variation made 
with peanuts, that my own mother has dubbed 
“Indian peanut brittle.” These foods are known 
to bring warmth to the body, and the sweet 
jaggery that holds it together gives all of its 
consumers a little kick of much-needed energy. 
With the progression of more modern celebra-
tions of the festival, the list of items has extend-
ed to include popcorn, peanuts, puffed rice, 
and what ever else will keep the fire roaring.
To bring a relatable edge to the Carnegie 
Mellon celebration of Lohri, OM provided 
snacks to roast in the fire, along with the items 
meant for tossing. The result was a gathering 
of people in search of a warm fire and great 
snacks, mixed in with those on campus who 
were far away from their families, but celebrat-
ing with them in spirit.
It is inclusive campus events like this that I 
find to be truly inspiring. Bringing flair and 
accessibility to complement what is always a 
fun and energetic celebration, these events 
make learning about the many cultures we 
have here on campus an enjoyable and seam-
less experience. With the dark of the night 
and the chill of the winter, the fire symbolized 
something more this past Friday night, behind 
Stever. It symbolized togetherness, in a time 
where we may have not expected it, but sure 
were glad to have it.
Fighting off the cold with fire and friends

Oscar season is here and cinephiles across 
the globe are placing their bets on 
which movies will win. This year my 
money was riding on La La Land 
(because Hollywood loves 
movies about Hollywood), or 
Manchester by the Sea, because 
most movies that win have to be about 
some really sad story of hardship and 
struggle. But still, even after all my careful 
analysis my bet was as well thought out as 
that of a drunk gambler placing all his money 
on number 31 at the roulette table. Next year 
though, my bets will be on point, because 
last week I had the opportunity to visit the 
Sundance Film Festival. 
The Sundance Film Festival is the great-
est predictor of Oscar buzz, not to mention 
the largest independent film festival in 
the United States. 
Here’s the 
catch: Movies 
that come out at 
Sundance this year 
will be considered 
at the 2018 Oscars (I 
know, it’s a little confus-
ing). While Manchester 
by the Sea, premiered 
at Sundance last year, La 
La Land director Damien 
Chazelle’s previous movie 
Whiplash, which won three 
Oscars, premiered at Sundance in 
2014. Over the past 39 years, the 
festival has given us countless phe-
nomenal movies and has provided a 
platform to launch the careers of many 
favorite directors such as Paul Thomas 
Anderson, Wes Anderson, The Coen 
Brothers, Christopher Nolan, and Quentin 
Tarantino — who was preent at 

---------------------------------------------------

the festival this year for the 25th anniversary screen-
ing of the Reservoir Dogs.
I had the opportunity to attend this screening with a 
few friends and fellow students, including first-year 
art major Coco Allred, sophomore humanities and 
arts BHA Brian Bizier, sophomore Dietrich student 
Danielle Geimer, senior statistics major Suvrath 
Penmetcha, and senior Human-Computer Interaction 
major and president of the Carnegie Mellon Film 
Club, Max Harlynking. 
In Harlynking’s words, “Getting to see Michael 
Madsen watch himself play Mr. Blonde in Reservoir 
Dogs 25 years later, with Quentin in the room, was 
just incredible. You don’t forget something like that.” 
The experience was, all-in-all, surreal and indicative 
of the amazing things you get the opportunity to wit-
ness at the Sundance Film Festival. When I narrated 
this story to Carnegie Mellon English Professor, Jeff 
Hinkelman, and the one stop for discussing all things 
film on campus, he prodded, “Yes, yes I get it, you 
saw Tarantino. But did you watch anything good?” 
Well yes, I did.
I watched eleven feature films, the short program 
award winners, and had an incredible eye-opening 
virtual reality (VR) experience. The feature films 
screened were Axolotyl Overkill, Where is Kyra?, 
XX, Machines, Free and Easy, Nile Hilton Incident, 
Roxanne Roxanne, Golden Exits, The Incredible 
Jessica James, My Happy Family, and Call Me By 
Your Name.
Axolotyl Overkill is a German film about a teenager 
who deals with her mother’s death, and her 
unsupervised escapades, such as falling in love with 
a much older woman. The story is about her journey 
to discover who she is and how she goes about 
living the rest of her life, all the while drinking, 
smoking, taking drugs, and partying with her crazy 
movie star friend. It is shot beautifully through the 
urban landscape of Berlin, and the changes in acts 
are depicted through surreal dance sequences. The 
film won the special jury award for cinematography. 
I would recommend looking up “axolotyl” before 
seeing the film if you want the best experience.
Machines was the only Indian film to premiere 
at the festival this year. It won the World 
Documentary Special Jury Award for Excellence in 
Cinematography. In it, director Rahul Jain takes us 
inside one of the textile mills in India. What starts as 
a depiction of the machinery and workings of the 
factory becomes a story of the plight of laborers 
and the apathy of the owners.
One of the best movies I watched at the festival this 
year was definitely the Nile Hilton Incident. It won 
the Grand Jury Prize in the World Cinema Dramatic 
category. The film is about a corrupt cop in Cairo 
at the start of the Arab spring, who is investigating 
the murder of a singer who was in a secret relation-
ship with one of the most powerful businessmen 
in Cairo. This movie had everything I ever want 
from any movie: a true depiction of corruption and 
greed, placed in a historical setting, with just enough 
intrigue, romance, drama, and thrill. In my mind, it is 
the only contemporary movie to come close to being 
as good as Casablanca.
Roxanne Roxanne was another amazing film, which 
follows the early life and struggles of hip-hop legend 
Roxanne Shante, who is played by none other than 
2016 Carnegie Mellon University Drama graduate 
Chante Adams, who went on to win the Sundance 
Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Performance 
for her role in the film.
Call Me by Your Name was the last movie that I 
watched at the festival and was one that honestly 
surprised me the most. The story is about a teenager 
falling in love with an older man visiting his father at 
his Italian summer home. It’s just that — even the par-
ents are okay with it. There is no homophobia. It is 
just a story of two men (well, a boy and a man) fall-
ing in love, and it is sexy, refreshing, and wonderful.
The Short Program Award winners, on the other 
hand, were disappointing. The shorts were good, 
no doubt, but I didn’t quite enjoy them as much as 
some of the other things I saw at the festival. One 
short did, however, stand out. And so we put gold-
fish in the pool was the name of this film, which 
won the Short Film Grand Jury Prize. The film is a 
Japanese story about four ‘bored’ (you’ll hear that 
word a lot in the movie) girls in middle school who 
place 400 goldfish in their school’s swimming pool. 
If that doesn’t sound interesting enough, let me tell 
you that watching the film reminded me of the time 
I watched my first French New Wave film. It is the 
feeling that this is how movies should be shot. It feels 
amazing, it feels right, and at the same time it feels 
completely novel.
The VR installations were something that I was, at 
first, a little skeptical about, but they blew my mind. 
“Life of Us” was one installation that particularly 
stood out. The way it works is you ‘play’ it with a 
partner — in my case, I played it with Penmetcha 
— and you and your partner enter different rooms. 
In these rooms you wear a headset, put on head-
phones and they hand you controllers. You are then 
taken through human evolution, from protozoa to 
tadpole, to dinosaurs, apes, humans and on to the 
next stage, robots. 
The experience was amazing. At each stage of the 
evolution, you become the creature, which means 
that if you looked down and about you could see 
your body, and if you looked around, you could see 
the world as it was at that time. I screamed through-
out this experience. The worst part is that once 
you’re done with the experience, they screen the 
version that you played so that everyone can see 
what you did and hear how much you screamed. 
It was definitely a very unique experience and her-
alds the great new technology that is coming in the 
future.
Other than watching amazing things and freezing to 
near death (the festival is held in Park City, Utah in 
January), there are many other things that you can 
do at Sundance. For many in the industry it is one 
of the best networking events of the year. You will 
often see people exchanging business cards on the 
streets, in busses, during movies, and at many of the 
networking events and parties. 
As a student, (or for anyone under 25), you can 
buy the Student Ignite Package and get access to 
15 screenings, various installations, and special 
Ignite events. I went to two of these events. The 
first was How Films Can Change the World, which 
was a panel of documentary filmmakers followed 
by a workshop where you work with other people 
to come up with a release idea for a hypothetical 
film. The second was the Festival Filmmaker Speed 
Dating, where you meet with many of the festivals 
filmmakers. There was also the Celebrate Sundance 
Ignite event, which I wasn’t able to attend, where 
Major Lazer was also in attendance. These events 
are a great opportunity to not only meet other 
young filmmakers but also spend some time with, 
and garner wisdom from, many of the festival 
filmmakers.
All in all, Sundance was an unbelievably incredible 
experience and I’m really happy that I got to do it 
with a group of amazing people. A huge shoutout 
to Carnegie Mellon University Film Club for making 
this trip possible. Hopefully, going into next year’s 
Oscar season, I will be better informed.
Now that I have made you jealous by telling you 
stories about all the amazing things I watched, I’m 
going to devote this last bit to telling you about how 
you can watch some of the amazing things we saw 
at the festival. Coming out on Amazon are The Big 
Sick, and Landline and coming out on Netflix are 
I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore and 
The Incredible Jessica James. I hope that you too 
will feel inspired to skip school and run away to 
Sundance next year.

The Power and the Soul is the annual Frame gal-
lery show focused on identity, intersectionality, and 
diversity, on view Jan. 27–Feb. 16. This exhibit 
offers an important and illuminating look at some 
of the Carnegie Mellon School of Art’s most prolific 
artists, whose presented artworks reflect the aura 
of the community’s sentiments towards the political 
climate and recent elections. Some of the works 
illustrate the artists’ personal experiences with 
the effect of politics infiltrating their lives, such as 
sophomore art major Aldy Lawantara’s “Childhood 
Memories of the Indonesian Genocide.” Other 
works are direct polemics of current political contro-
versies, such as junior art major Andrew Edwards’ 
“Help me be Heard,” a screen print criticizing the 
Dakota Access Pipeline project.
The show included two discussion events, where 
curators Maya Kaisth, a senior art major, Kasem 
Kydd, a junior also majoring in art, and Daniel 
See Yongxin, a Bachelor of Humanities and Art 
sophomore, monitored the conversations and ques-
tions visitors had regarding the artists’ creative 
practices, the development of their works, and the 
thought processes of combining personal and politi-
cal elements. The discussion embodied a free-form 
structure, where the artists present could choose to 
talk about their work while visitors were invited to 
provide commentaries. Anyone could open up dis-
cussions about race and inequality.
I had the pleasure of attending one of these dis-
cussions in the Frame. It started with Kydd, who 
introduced his work “The First Black Men on the 
Moon.” Originally a video for multi-monitors meant 
to imitate a triptych (a quintessential framework of 
art predominantly found in religious Renaissance 
and Gothic creations), “The First Black Men on the 
Moon” explores the historical context, and attempts 
to rewrite historical narratives of the past, present, 
and future. The piece is a digital lineage of video-
making, unbound to the traditions of what the craft 
originally means. Inside the three channel video 
monitors, Kydd plays multiple characters and how 
they interact on a lunar landscape. He explores 
what the impacts are like for that particular event, 
how the black men interact in these spaces and 
what those interactions mean, and how culturally 
relevant they are now.
Calm and introspective, Kydd narrated the creative 
and interpretive choices that effectively symbolize 
his struggle with manhood, mental rigidity, and 
race. His focus tunneled toward certain spaces, like 
sports. He uses his work as escapist spaces where 
he leaves the physical world and where he can pre-
tend to be a basketball player, a dream he always 
had as a child growing up with black basketball 
role models.
What I initially believed would become an emotion-
ally charged discussion filled with tension turned 
out to be quiet and courteous, with many attendees 
lost in speechless contemplation. Artists seated 
around the circle shifted quietly, perhaps reflecting 
on the societal bounds that trap them, the possibili-
ties they couldn’t achieve. One commentator stated 
how peculiar it is that young black men are recre-
ated in sports games much more than science fic-
tion games or fantasy games, so the limit of imagi-
nativeness is constrained. It seems that black men 
are trapped within the limits of choosing between 
being represented as a rapper or an athlete. Kydd 
nodded in agreement.
This was the pace for the next hour and a half. 
Artists sat in a circle patiently waiting their turn. 
Each artist humbly described their pieces, fol-
lowed by a moments of silence. Kaisth, poised on 
her bench seat, provided commentary that filled 
the pockets of silence, provoking the artists to 
elaborate on their experiences and artistic choices. 
When faced with a new description around the 
circle, her eyes would light up, attentive and obser-
vant. On one occasion, Bachelor of Humanities 
and Arts sophomore Chloe Desaulles described her 
data visualization piece, a submission-based feed 
that provided a platform for opinions to be protect-
ed in complete anonymity. Kaisth, impressed with its 
interactive qualities and shouldering the responsibil-
ity of sustaining the conversation, commented on 
the work quite like a critique. “It would be really 
interesting for you to have it in different geographi-
cal locations, because here... at [Carnegie Mellon], 
people seem to feel the same way even though 
there are a few outliers.”
The conversation became more lively when an art-
ist expressed her conflict between being a maker 
and an activist. “It’s a hard balance of an issue, 
and there is so much guilt associated with it,” she 
said, questioning the usefulness of her work and 
struggling with allocating her time to both her craft 
and student activism. Many agreed on the dif-
ficulty of fulfilling that dual role. Kydd, who had 
slowly become more outspoken during the session, 
remarked thoughtfully how necessary it is “to real-
ize the importance of the work you’re making 
and the roles it can have in the future, to harness 
that power onto yourself. [I] think it’s super neces-
sary to... realize you can be both simultaneously.” 
Everyone else nodded.
Excellently curated, Power and the Soul successfully 
chronicles the emotional turmoil many individuals 
experienced regarding the “pain we have seen, 
heard and felt within our communities, and America 
as a whole,” as the currators promised in the 
exhibit’s description.  
Interactive and inclusive, the show is a step forward 
in providing a platform for necessary conversations 
about the human condition amidst a polarized era.

MonsterSNOW
CONES
Sarah 
Gutekunst
Contributing 
Editor
No matter how old I get, 
snow days still feel like 
a sort of everyday magic 
— especially now that 
they’re fewer and further 
in between. Waking up 
to a phone call or email 
bearing the good news, I’m 
11 again, squealing with 
excitement. No work, and 
I don’t even have to feel 
guilty!
In the snow day state of 
mind, there’s nothing to 
worry about. The world only 
extends as far as you want it 
to. Maybe it’s only as far as 
the window where you sit in 
your pajamas, mesmerized 
by each falling flake, or 
trying to catch glimpses of 
your neighbors to make sure 
there’s still life out there. 
Or maybe you take to the 
couch and turn on a movie 
to extend the world a little 
further, maybe the whole 
way to Platform 9 ¾ or even 
a wormhole to another 
dimension.
On these days, time feels 
stolen, like a personal 
day you didn’t ask for 
but offered up by Mother 
Nature who, with her 
maternal intuition, sensed 
you could use the time 
off. She gives us all the 
permission to forget what 
may come tomorrow and 
thoroughly enjoy today. This 
really is magical.
But what’s a magic show 
without a little popcorn? It 
may be too late to drive to 
the grocery store to pick 
up extra special snow day 
snackies, leaving you with 
only what you already have 
at your disposal. But I’m 
willing to bet you at least 
have sugar, milk, and vanilla 
extract floating around 
your kitchen, maybe some 
powdered drink mix or a 
little booze, too.
Lace up your snow boots 
and zip up your puffiest 
coat. The only missing 
ingredient? Snow! Because 
the whole day already feels 
a few degrees away from 
reality, the perfect snack to 
celebrate the magic takes 
advantage of the bounty 
that Mother Nature has 
bestowed. It’s like reaping 
the day’s harvest of whimsy. 
There’s almost a silliness to 
enjoying a cold snack on 
a cold day. Wrapped up in 
pajamas and blankets, next 
to the radiator, you’re safe 
from the cold snap of the 
outside air. If you close your 
eyes while you cool down 
with a fresh snowy snow 
cone, you can almost picture 
the poolside cabana you 
could be lying in. Still, from 
your room, the world grows 
a little larger once again.
The best part, though, 
is the treasure hunt for a 
bowlful of perfectly clean, 
untouched, and un-peed-
upon snow. Later in the day 
this can be a fun challenge. 
Each serving requires about 
four cups of snow, packed 
as hard as you can.
Vanilla Snow Cone
The classic.
• 4 cups of snow
• 1 teaspoon of vanilla 
extract
• ¼ cup of sugar
• ½ cup of milk
Combine ingredients 
and stir.
Kool-Aid Snow Cone
The nostalgic.
• 4 cups of snow
• 4 tablespoons of pre 
sweetened Kool-Aid mix
Combine and stir. If 
you have the Kool-Aid 
packets that do not come 
presweetened, add two 
tablespoons of sugar.
Frozen Margarita
Snow at the beach.
• 4 cups of snow
• 5 ounces of tequila
• 2 ½ ounces of triple 
sec
• ½ cup of lime juice
• ¼ cup of simple syrup 
(heat ¼ cup each of 
sugar and water)
Mix ingredients until 
chilled. Pour over a 
glass of packed snow.
Frozen Irish Coffee
This one’s for Mommy.
• 4 cups of snow
• 1 teaspoon of vanilla 
extract
• ¼ cup of sugar
• ¼ cup of coffee
• ¼ cup of Irish cream
Combine all the ingre-
dients and stir.
Maple Snow Candy
Bonus treat.
• Sheet tray full of snow
• ½ cup of pure maple 
syrup
Boil maple syrup until 
a thermometer reads 
255 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Slowly pour the maple 
syrup in strips onto 
the tray of snow. It will 
instantly harden into a 
chewy candy.
