DU to appeal ruling
By KARL BARNHART
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
Despite rolling the second fastest time in 
buggy history last year, Delta Upsilon might 
not be able to compete in Sweepstakes this year 
because of a ruling handed down by the Sweep­
stakes Committee last week.
Citing safety reasons, Sweepstakes Chair 
Chris Hansen told a meeting of buggy chairmen 
last Monday that he had decided to ban two­
wheeled buggies from competition this year.
“This ruling allows [the Sweepstakes Com­
mittee] to concentrate on what we’re supposed 
to be doing. We’re supposed to be running an 
event as safely as we possibly can,” said Hansen.
DU, whose two-wheeled buggy King Eider 
held the course record at 2:08.5 for a few hours 
last year, has built only two-wheeled buggies 
for the past five years. Now, with spring freerolls 
less than three weeks away, DU will not be able 
to design and build another buggy in time for 
Sweepstakes and will not roll unless Hansen’s 
decision is reversed, according to DU’s buggy 
chairman Dave Smith.
“We might be able to buy a three-wheeler, or 
we could maybe design a three-wheeler by about 
spring break — but we haven’t explored either 
of these possibilities yet,” said Smith.
Other buggy organizations, including Spirit' 
and Pi Kappa Alpha, believe that DU can build 
a three-wheeled buggy by race day.
Hansen’s ruling follows five years of debate 
about the safety of two-wheeled buggies. Last 
May, after King Eider crashed on the second 
day of Sweepstakes, the Sweepstakes Commit­
tee wrote seven rules which banned any new

Pittsburgh mayoral

By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
The first debate of the 1989 
Pittsburgh mayoral campaign 
was held January 29 to discuss 
the topic of “New Business and 
Economic Development in Pitts­
burgh.”
The debate, described by 
Moderator Herb Stein as more 
of “an organized press confer­
ence” than a debate, was at­
tended by four of the top five 
democratic candidates: City 
Controller Tom Flaherty, At­
torney Byrd Brown, State Rep­
resentative Tom Murphy, and 
County Controller Frank Luc- 
chino.
The fifth candidate, Interim 
Mayor Sophie Masloff, was 
invited to the debate but chose 
not to come. .Masloff has said 
that she is willing to debate but 
not until March 22, the last day 
to withdraw from the May 16

will not be clear who is running 
until that time. Her opponents 
have criticized her for being 
unwilling to debate sooner.
In contrast to the debates of 
last year’s presidential election, 
the mayoral debate showed 
more similarities than differ­
ences between the candidates. 
The candidates agreed that 
Pittsburgh needs an entertain­

Students stand outside Warner Hall in the freezing rain Friday 
morning. They were protesting the administration’s cancellation of 
the Beaux Arts Ball.
The Beaux Arts Ball, a bash 
traditionally held every four 
years and open only to students 
in the College of Fine Arts, has 
been cancelled by the admini­
stration approximately one 
month before it was scheduled to 
occur.
In a memo distributed on Janu- 
ary 30 to the Beaux Arts Ball 
Committee, Dean of Student 
Affairs Brad Walter cited the 
reasons for the cancellation as 
being “the management of alco­
hol and drugs,” and described 
the ball as “an uncontrollable 
event.”
Walter’s announcement 
brought strong reactions around 
the campus. At 8 am on Friday, a

demonstration was held outside

students came to protest, chant­

Anthony Rothberg, a sopho­

ment that appeared representa­
tive of many of the demonstra­
tors’ feelings. “It’s a shame that 
schools like CIT and MCS get so

Jen Saffron, also a sophomore CFA 
student, claimed that “the University 
cops out on CFA too many times. If it’s 
an issue of money, I think we shell out 
enough bucks to cover this event.”

The Carnegie Mellon Action Project 
(CMAP) celebrated its twentieth anni­
versary on Saturday. The program was 
held at Skibo in a Faculty Dining Room 
filled with staff, students, and alumni 
of the organization.
The evening opened with a welcome 
given by the assistant director of CMAP, 
Tywanta Walton, followed by a short 
benediction.
CMU President Dr. Richard Cyert 
delivered a speech which was based on 
“celebrating the worth and dignity of 
human beings.” Cyert began his pres­
entation by recalling days in which CMU 
was almost exclusively white, and 
minority students were not welcomed. 
He mentioned an incident concerning 
two CMU faculty members who were 
unable to bring a Japanese faculty 
member to a swimming pool.
Cyert also discussed the environment 
surrounding Pittsburgh that existed 
before CMAP. Although people made 
an effort to educate others,-prejudice 
remained. According to Cyert, at CMU, 
“we’ve learned t6 judge the worth of 
people based- on factors other than 
color..,.. The one aim of this University 
is to improve the human condition all 
over the world.”
Cyert applauded CMAP for bringing 
in a diversity of societies and resources, 
and stated, “I hope we can continue to 
expand the number of black students 
and faculty members here.” He ended 
his speech by stressing that intellec­
tual ability is the only criteria for en-

should glorify and celebrate and work

Erroll R. Davis, Jr., the main speaker 
at the banquet, graduated from CMU 
with a degree in electrical engineering 
in 1965, Davis is currently the Presi­
dent and CEO of Wisconsin Power and 
Light Company and is the highest 
ranking Black executive in corporate 
America.
In 1988, Davis was named Black En­
gineer of the Year by U.S. Black Engi­
neer. In July Davis, will serve on CMU’s
Board of Trustees.
In his presentation, Davis revealed 
that he had “mixed emotions about 
coming back to CMU.” He began by 
recalling life when he entered the Uni­
versity: Tuition was $400 per semes­
ter and the challenges presented to 
him were “formidable and more than 
anticipated.”
Davis felt that CMU had changed 
tremendously, noting that Carnegie

more supportive. Davis gave several

President Cyert has formed a committee to look at the work 
environment and the family support system on campus. Profes­
sor Lee Sproull of the department of Social and Decision Sci­
ences will chair the committee.
In a memo to the committee, Cyert cited an increase in the 
number of families in the CMU community with a single parent
- or with both parents working outside the home. Cyert asked for 
guidance in developing policies that will better meet the needs 
, of the campus community.
, One of Cyert’s ideas is to take a survey of the people on campus 
to determine some of the problems in the university work 
. environment and to elicit suggestions for improvement.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — 
President P.W. Botha, who is 
recovering from a stroke suffered 
two weeks ago, resigned Thurs­
day as the leader of the governing 
National Party, the government 
said.
There was no immediate indi­
cation if Botha had any plans to 
step down as president. Doctors 
said Thursday that Botha would 
need at least another month be­
fore he could consider returning 
to work.
Botha was replaced as party 
leader by National Education 
Minister F.W. de Klerk, who is 
considered one of the leading 
candidates to succeed Botha as 
president.
Botha became party leader in 
1978 at the same time he was 
elected prime minister. He be­
came president in 1984 under a 
new constitution that abolished 
the post of prime minister.

ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) — 
The number two army com­
mander seized power Friday in a 
coup that ousted President Al­
fredo Stroessner, the longest rul­
ing leader in the Western Hemi­
sphere, official radio said.
Gen. Andres Rodriguez, com-
mander of the powerful First 
Army Corps and a close associate 
of Stroessner, said in a radio 
broadcast that Paraguay’s com- 
mander-in-chief for 34 years had 
surrendered.
The announcement came after 
hours of gunfights and cannon 
fire between rebels backed by 
tanks and mortars and forces loyal 
to Stoessner.
There was no word of casual­
ties.
The rebellion follows a dispute 
within the ruling Colorado Party 
between a militant pro-Stroess- 
ner faction and traditionalists who 
wanted to distance the 100-year- 
old party from the authoritarian 
general.
Stroessner, 76, had been the 
absolute ruler of this landlocked 
South American country since 
1954.

BEIJING (AP) — The Chinese

Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev 
to China, signaling an end to a 30- 
year breach in direct contacts 
between leaders of the two coun­
tries.
The Foreign Ministry said in a 
statement that Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen had extended the 
invitation to his Soviet counter­
part, Eduard Shevardnadze, and 
Shevardnadze had “accepted the
invitation and expressed his grati­
tude.”
No date for the visit was given. 
Qian said on Friday that Shevard­
nadze would announce the date 
at a news conference Saturday, 
before he leaves China for Paki­
stan.
The visit is widely expected to 
take place this spring.
Gorbachev will be the first 
Soviet General Secretary to visit 
China since Nikita Khrushchev

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) — 
A lone hijacker seized control of a 
Colombian airliner with 116 pas­
sengers and six crew members 
aboard, authorities said, and 
surrendered after the plane 
landed in Costa Rica.
The Ace airline Boeing 727 was 
commandeered at about 11 am 
after taking off from San Andres 
Island, Colombia, en route to the 
city of Medellin, the Civil Aero­
nautics Department of Colombia 
said.
Officials in Colombia said the 
plane’s pilot, Capt. Jaime Perez, 
reported the hijacker had a con­
tainer that apparently was filled 
with gasoline.
The pilot was quoted as saying 
the man threatened to spill the 
liquid over a passenger and set it
afire.
The hijacker turned himself in 
to authorities after the plane 
landed in Costa Rica at about 
noon on Tuesday, control tower 
officials said at the airport north 
of the Costa Rican capital.
Public Security Director Her. 
nan Garron said the hijacker 
apparently acted alone. He said it 
was not known if the hijacker 
made any demands.

WASHINGTON (DJ) — The 
Bush administration is consider­

Kuwait a total of more than 500 of 
its most modem tanks and pro­
viding the United Arab Emirates 
with 40 F-18 jet fighters.
The possible sales, which could 
lead to a clash with Israel’s sup­

cluded last month in a list the ad­
ministration is required to sub­
mit to law makers detailing pos­
sible foreign military transactions 
for the coming year, according to 
people familiar with the list.
In addition, a cover letter noted 
that Saudi Arabia is considering 
a major purchase of aircraft to 
replace its aging F-5 jet fighters. 
Among the options would be the 
purchase of U.S.-made F-16 or F- 
18 fighters.
Such a sale would set off a major 
battle with Congress. However, 
the State Department said it 
doesn’t anticipate such a sale this

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — 
President Bush sent Nicaragua a 
telegram saying that he was
“willing to work for peace,” Nica­
raguan President Daniel Ortega 
said on Thursday.
Ortega said in a live television 
interview that he had sent a let­
ter of congratulations to Bush on 
the occasion of Bush’s inaugura­
tion, and that Bush had sent him 
a telegram in response “in which 
he said he was willing to work for 
peace.”
In the letter, Ortega said, he 
had reminded Bush of the time 
they shook hands at the inaugu­
ration of Brazilian President Jose 
Sarney, when Bush was still vice- 
president, and how “all the lead­
ers of the world had applauded 
this unanimously.”
In a press conference following
the interview, Ortega said that 
“the conditions are not yet ripe for 
a direct dialogue” between the 
U.S. and Nicaragua.
Ortega did not say whether he 
would meet with Vice-President 
Dan Quayle as they both attended 
ceremonies last week surround­
ing Friday’s inauguration of 
Venezuelan President-Elect Car; 
los Andres Perez.
Ortega didn’t specify what con­
ditions Nicaragua seeks or when 
exactly a reply could be expected 
from him.

fbe revised and all favored a “com­
muter” tax on people who live 
.elsewhere but work in Pittsburgh. 
They agreed, however, that such 
•a tax would be politically impos­
sible.
One of the most significant 
.areas of disagreement between 
,the candidates was over the pre­
vailing wage bill passed by City 
.Council last year and vetoed by 
-•'Masloff. The bill would have re­
quired the city to pay prevailing 
:union wages to people employed 
in publicly funded construction 
.projects.
Flaherty was the only candi­
date who said he would have 
signed the bill as mayor. He 
pointed out that federal and state 
laws calling for prevailing wages 
give municipalities the mandate 
to enforce them.
Lucchino favors the idea of 
prevailing wages but said, “The 
city can not be everything to eve­
rybody. There are state and fed­
eral laws that can be enforced. 
Let them be enforced. Let the city 
fnot continue to perpetuate this 
idea that it’s difficult to do busi­
ness in Western Pennsylvania...”
Brown and Murphy opposed the 
bill because they said it would 
have inhibited economic develop­
ment. Brown argued that “With 
respect to the kind of construc­
tion that the [City Council! objec­
tors were concerned with, that is, 
small neighborhood development, 
I don’t think prevailing rates 
should be mandated. We must do 
whatever we can, regardless of 
vested interests, to make certain 
that we can have some form of 
economic development at least 
begin in our neighborhoods.” 
Murphy added that “The origi­
nal prevailing wage laws drafted 
by council would have done some­
thing that really hasn’t existed in 
the city and would have undercut 
the ability for us to develop small 
scale neighborhood housing and 
some other projects, such as a 
brewery, innovation center, and 
others.”
One of the questions raised early 
in the debate was how the recent 
U.S. Supreme Court ruling in­
validating a Richmond, Virginia 
affirmative action law would ef­
fect affirmative action programs 
in Pittsburgh. All four candidates 
expressed their support for the 
idea of helping minorities advance 
economically.
Murphy said he would encour­
age and help people start busi­
nesses. Lucchino and Flaherty 
stood on their records of helping
—The Democratic mayoral candidatesR
Byrd Brown, the only one of the five candi­
dates who has not held elective office, has 
been an attorney in Pittsburgh since 1956. He 
is the chair of the Disciplinary Board of the 
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and a former 
head of the Pittsburgh branch of the NAACP.
Tom Flaherty, 38, has been a state legislator 
and a member of City Council. Since 1984 he 
has been the city controller. He lost a bid for the 
Democratic mayoral nomination in 1985.
Tom Murphy has worked with many private 
sector community groups and is currently a 
state representative. He is credited with creat­
ing the Ben Franklin Partnership, an organiza­
tion that coordinates cooperation between the 
government and private industry.
Frank Lucchino, 49, was a districtjustice for 
Allegheny County in the early seventies and 
also served on City Council. He has been 
Allegheny County controller since 1979. He 
ran for mayor previously in 1977.
Sophie Masloff, 71, is the incumbent mayor. She took office when 
former mayor Richard Caliguiri died last May. Masloff was a member 
of City Council for 12 years before becoming mayor. She is considered 
the front runner, although she did not attend last Sunday’s debate.photos by Phil Heil
minorities in the past. Lucchino 
commented that the issues are 
sensitivity and finding minority 
applicants, saying, “We [the 
county controller’s office] have a 
minority employment much 
higher than what the average is 
of the county population — al­
most twice as much — without 
ever having to deal with quotas.” 
Brown, the only black candi­
date for mayor, said that “What
we have in terms of city and county 
government is totally unaccept­
able.” However, he thinks that 
the Richmond case will not ham­
per future affirmative action 
programs in Pittsburgh. He ex­
plained that “The case basically 
says that if there is an affirmative 
finding of past discrimination 
then [an affirmative action law] 
will pass constitutional muster. I 
don’t think there is any doubt
that in the city of Pittsburgh there 
has been past discrimination.” 
The mayoral debate was held at 
the Center for Entrepreneurial 
Development (CED) in East Lib­
erty. The CED is an organization 
which helps entrepreneurs get 
started in new businesses. It was 
founded in 1971 by Carnegie 
Mellon faculty members. One of 
the panelists for the debate was 
School of Urban and Public Af­
fairs professor Ben Fischer.
The debate was broadcast live 
on radio and rebroadcast five 
times by Pittsburgh Cable TV 
between January 29 and Febru­
ary 5. It was also scheduled to be 
shown by WNEU-TV (channel 63).
Because of the party’s registra­
tion advantage, most people agree 
that the winner of the Democratic 
primary will win the general elec­
tion in November.

p spring,” said CMU President 
•chard Cyert in his speech on 
January 18.
^cording to Director of Uni- 
Lersity Planning Patrick Keating, 
sale of the Center is in the 
avy’s best interest because Navy
officials have already been look­
ing to consolidate the reserves in 
Pittsburgh and McKeesport in a 
different location.
After the purchase of the build­
ing, the Navy would most likely 
rent space in the building from 
Carnegie Mellon until it can relo­
cate. Short term plans for the 
naval building include either 
using it for classrooms and offices 
or for expanding the physical 
plant.
CMU has approached both the 
Naval Reserves and the Naval 
Facilities Command about pur­
chasing the Center. The Navy 
authorized an appraisal of the 
building, but has not yet re- 
• sponded to efforts for a meeting 
between the two parties to nego­
tiate the transaction.
“Within the next six to nine 
months we hope to be able to 
reach an agreement which will 
turn into a sales contract,” 
Keating said.
He also explained that any 
contract will have to be approved 
by congressional legislation in 
order to take effect.

Administration plans renovations in chemistry labs
By ERIC W. LEULIETTE
: Tartan Contributing Editor
The Department of Chemistry is de­
veloping a plan to renovate its four 
" Doherty Hall undergraduate teaching 
laboratories. In January, L.P. Perfido 
' Associates, which conducted a prelimi- 
nary study of the project, estimated that 
the new facilities will cost between $6 
and $8.5 million.
Last year, the Middle States Accredi­
tation review was critical of the condi­
tion of undergraduate laboratory facili­
ties. The chemistry labs were last reno­
vated in the early 1960s. Mellon College 
of Science Dean Robert Sekerka formed
a committee of chemistry faculty to plan 
the improvements, according to Assis­
tant MCS Dean Betty Maurer.
The renovation serves a dual purpose. 
It will improve the safety of the labs by 
adding equipment such as exhaust hoods. 
More importantly, it will improve under­
graduate teaching.
“There is a nationwide crisis in stu­
dents entering the physical sciences,” 
says Director of Undergraduate Labora­
tories Karen Stump. “A way to address 
this problem is to strengthen laboratory 
education.”
The initial study determined that the 
renovation can be completed with the 
existing space in Doherty. The next step
in the project is the selection of the archi­
tectural and engineering firms which 
will complete a detailed planning study 
of the work.
The Perfido Associates study suggested 
that work be completed in three phases, 
so that no more than one major lab would 
be out of commission at once. In the first 
phase, the freshman lab on the first floor 
of Doherty would be renovated. The 
organic lab would be renovated in the 
second phase, and both the synthetic 
chemistry and physical chemistry labs 
in the third.
The freshman lab is used by 300 to 350 
students a year. A chemical engineering 
research lab, near the freshman lab, is
currently being renovated in an unre­
lated project.
“It’s safe to assume that a large propor­
tion of the funds [for the renovations] 
will come from outside the University,” 
says Stump. Manager of Foundation Re­
lations John A. Selter has supported the 
renovations and encouraged fund rais­
ing from corporations and foundations.
Associate Professor Terry Collins 
stresses the priority laboratory experi­
ence holds in education. “Chemistry is 
an experimental science.... It is hollow 
without experiments.”
One of the members of the committee 
which oversees the project, Collins sees 
the renovations in a broader context of
improving chemistry education at all 
levels. He says that only 30 percent of 
freshman who intend to major in chem­
istry actually complete a degree in the 
discipline.
Collins is promoting an Institute for 
Teaching Experimental Chemistry which 
he hopes Carnegie Mellon will establish. 
The institute would develop innovative 
teaching laboratory projects. These labs 
would be for both college and high school 
levels.
By establishing continuity between 
high school and college chemistry and 
providing relevant and interesting ex­
periments, Collins hopes the institute 
will help re-enthuse the science.

DU’s two-wheeled buggies

DU to roll its two-wheelers for 
one more year, providing the same 
drivers drove the same buggies.
According to these rules, how­
ever, DU was only permitted to 
roll alone, both in the prelimi­
nary and final races. Meanwhile, 
the Sweepstakes Advisory Com­
mittee — a group of alumni to

However, over the summer,
* DU’s King Eider was stolen from

j with only its “B” buggy, Horned 
Screamer. So that DU could roll 
its best buggy, Witchner told DU’s 
brothers in November that they 
could build a new King Eider as 
long as the new buggy exactly

George Bush has stated, both 
in campaign rhetoric and in post- 
electoral press conferences, that 
he wants to be the “education 
president.” Although Bush’s in­
dentions for elementary and sec­
ondary school programs are fairly 
clear, it seems that his policies 
will have little effect on higher 
¡education.
By retaining Ronald Reagan’s 
last Secretary of Education, Lauro 
!F. Cavazos, Bush has maintained
policy connection with the prior 
¡administration.
Although a fine educator and 
administrator, Cavazos is not a 
reformer in any sense of the word. 
He has not spoken at any length 
on college curricular issues, nor 
has he read Allan Bloom’s contro­
versial indictment of American
Senate to nominate academic reps tonight
tion yet.
All along, DU has contended 
that its buggies are safe despite 
never completing Sweepstakes. 
“If I didn’t think it were safe, I 
wouldn’t drive it,” said Smith, who 
has driven Horned Screamer for 
the past two years.
Lou Conley, a three-year mem­
ber of the alumni safety commit­
tee and a Westinghouse mechani­
cal engineer, disagreed with 
Smith. “Personally, I think two­
wheeled buggies should have been 
banned long ago. I think that two- 
wheelers are more dangerous 
than three- or four-wheelers and 
there is no reason to increase the 
danger inherent with buggy.” 
Specifically, Conley said that 
two-wheelers are unsafe for three 
reasons:
•They are statically unstable, 
meaning they fall over when not 
moving;
•They fall over on the course if 
they are bumped by another 
buggy; and
•They fall from, a height, riding 
higher on the course than most 
other buggies.
The decision to ban two-wheel-

ers was not unanimous. “I think it
sucks. The decision was made at 
the end of last semester to allow 
them to roll, so [the Sweepstakes 
Committee] should have made 
rules to allow that,” said Beta 
Buggy Chairman Roy Guy.
On the other hand, Pika Buggy 
Chairman Mike Smith agreed 
with Hansen: “I think this is the ’ 
right decision. If they decided to 
outlaw two-wheeled buggies next 
year, why roll the dice again?”
Hansen said that his decision is 
final and can only be overturned 
by President Richard Cyert.'
“My big concern with the whole 
deal is this: excluding last year, 
the rules have been that two- 
wheelers roll by themselves. If a 
two wheeled-buggy is so unsafe 
that it has to roll by itself, then it 
shouldn’t roll at all. You’re either 
safe or you’re not,” said Hansen.
DU said it would appeal this 
decision.

higher education, The Closing of 
the American Mind, according to 
one profile. Although Cavazos has 
expressed an interest in the fi­
nancial problems colleges and stu­
dents face, his focus is clearly not 
on the tough issues of American 
higher education.
According to Carnegie Mellon’s 
Associate Director of Financial 
Aid Linda Anderson, Cavazos sent 
out a letter to financial aid profes­
sionals asking for ideas and opin­
ions on the problem of student 
loan defaults. It is an admirable 
initiative, but it shows that Ca­
vazos and the Bush Administra­
tion are more interested in finan­
cial issues than purely educa­
tional ones.
Another example of the new 
administration’s focus on finan-
cial issues can be seen in one of 
Bush’s campaign promises about 
college education. He proposed to 
encourage parents to save for their 
children’s tuition through “college 
savings bonds,” which would al­
low parents to accumulate inter­
est tax-free.
Because of federal budget con­
straints Bush can offer few new 
programs which would address 
rising college costs. The new presi­
dent cannot afford to spend much 
money on higher education ini­
tiatives, so his administration is 
likely to continue proposing pro­
grams which don’t cost money or 
give tax breaks.
Problems in higher education 
which will face the Bush Admini­
stration are teacher shortages, 
declining international competi­
tiveness* and a lack of scientifi­
cally and technically trained pro­
fessionals. Without a higher pro­
file Secretary of Education, like 
Reagan’s William Bennett (who
preceded Cavazos in that posi­
tion), progress in these areas will 
be difficult.

Compromise committee formed.
-grdx-dsWm .crn uAyW a
steering committee, pending con­
firmation by the trustees.
The committee is the result of a 
compromise resolution passed by 
Senate last week after an original 
resolution was vetoed by Ro- 
bitshek. The compromise was 
tentatively worked out last Sun­
day night at a two hour and fifty 
minute emergency meeting called 
by Senate Chair Glenn Kornbrek; 
Tuesday’s resolution was written 
by GSIA’s Stew Levine and intro­
duced by H&SS’s Matt Ruben.
The only difference between last 
Sunday’s compromise and Tues­
day’s resolution is the absence of 
a Senate representative on the 
committee. After the compromise 
resolution was introduced, Lev­
ine called for an amendment 
removing the lone Senator.
Both Levine’s amendment and 
the resolution passed Senate af­
ter little debate, and Robitshek 
promised Tuesday he would not 
veto the resolution.
Four students who served on 
Robitshek’s original committee 
will not be asked to sit on the new 
committee. They are Adam Gold­
smith of AB, Karl Barnhart from 
The Tartan, Senator Jeff 
Rosenblum, and original Chair 
Kishore Rao. The original com­
mittee met once, on January 23.
Students interested in becom­
ing academic representatives on 
the new committee should appear 
at tonight’s Student Senate meet­
ing in the Wherrett Room at 7:00.

CFA students protest cancellation of Beaux Arts Ball

ment it was to be on cam­
pus and dry, and all of a 
sudden it came out of the 
blue, and they [Student 
Affairs] let me know that 
this wasn’t enough, and it 
was cancelled.”
However, Lambert ad­
mitted that “students tend -------
to think that‘dry’means to 
bring your own alcohol,” and “no 
faculty member is going to want 
to chaperone a huge group of 
people for an entire night.”
Due to the large number of fac­
tors involved, a number of op­
tions for the Beaux Arts Ball are 
available.
Walter indicated in the memo 
sent to the ball committee that 
“the University is willing to con­
sider alternatives.” He added, 
however, that he “wasn’t sure if 
an off-campus ball would be a 
University event.”
Despite this, Norman Larson, 
the fifth-year architecture student 
who organized Friday’s protest, 
stated that he’d “rather have it 
off-campus than not at all,” and 
“[the planning committee] would 
like to get Walter to consider it.” 
Holding the event off-campus,
“A Beaux Arts Ball as 
we know It is some­
thing we can’t discuss.” 
R Dean Walter
however, brings its own concerns, 
one of which is drinking and driv­
ing.
A comparison between 
the Beaux Arts Ball and the 
recent MCS/CIT Winter 
Ball has arisen repeatedly. 
Larson said that “they did 
serve alcohol at the MCS/ 
CIT Ball.” Walter could not 
confirm or deny Larson’s as- 
sertion.
Holding an event on-cam- 
pus involving alcohol, whether
brings to mind the incident with 
the Liquor Control Board that oc­
curred at the fraternities last year 
that resulted in the arrest of over 
130 CMU students. Walter illus­
trated this fear by outlining a 
possible scenario for the ball: 
“Imagine twenty buses pullingup 
in front of CFA that night.”
CFA students are claiming the 
Beaux Arts Ball isn’t dead yet. 
Lambert indicated that “there is 
a meeting this coming Monday
[yesterday] to discuss the ball 
although he didn’t know where 
the meeting was being held or 
exactly who was involved. Of the 
student standpoint, Lambert 
stressed that “the ball’s in our 
court, and we have to scramble t<j 
get it back.”
At the very least, major changes 
will be necessary. “A Beaux Arts 
Ball as we know it is somethin 
we can’t discuss,” Walter told Th(

key points of advice to CMU stu­
dents: to master the basics, keep 
all options open, take advantage 
of opportunities, and to acknowl­
edge that “in spite of what Mr. 
Sinatra claims—you’re not going 
to do it your way.”
Davis stressed that the most 
difficult thing he has done in his 
lifetime was “to get out of CMU.” 
In his conclusion, Davis noted that 
“life is a mixture of success and 
failure ... the education you re­
ceive here will prepare you for the 
challenge of tomorrow.” After his 
speech, Davis held a question and 
answer period.
CMAP was originally estab­
lished in 1968 to provide a sup­
port system for minority students 
and to aid in their recruitment to 
CMU as well as their graduation 
from CMU. The director of CMAP 
is Gloria P. Hill. CMAP has grown 
into a large campus organization 
and holds a variety of activities. 
In addition to serving as a center 
for minority students to relax, 
CMAP hosts a five-week pre-col­

An anonymous proposal asking 
for a 37 percent reimbursement of 
Greek activities fee money to the 
Council of Fraternity Presidents 
and Panhel is being considered by 
members of the Greek system.
The activities fee — $40 per 
student per semester — is con­
trolled by Student Senate and 
allocated to student organizations 
which meet certain membership 
requirements. Specifically, funded 
organizations must not discrimi­
nate on any basis, including sex.
Clearly, since most Greek or­
ganizations don’t meet this re­
quirement, their events are not 
usually funded from the activities 
fee, except for ones which are open 
to all students such as Kappa Al­
pha Theta’s Mr. Fraternity and 
the Watermelon Bash.
Additionally, the proposal con­
tends that most Greeks are not 
involved in non-Greek organiza­
tions, so they only benefit from 
the activities fee through “cam­
pus films, lectures, and Spring 
Carnival events.”
The proposal likens Greeks to 
graduate students. In 1981, the 
Graduate Student Organization 
petitioned the Board of Trustees 
so that it could control 37 percent 
of graduate activities fees to be 
used at GSO’s discretion. Just like 
the proposal’s author argues now, 
GSO argued that graduates gen­
erally weren’t involved in under­
graduate organizations.
And, like the graduates then, 
the Greeks have some serious 
problems with their proposal now.
First, we at The Tartan ques­
tion the wisdom behind a pro­
posal that would further splinter 
an already segmented campus. If 
the proposal is approved, the
For 20 years, the Carnegie 
Mellon Action Project has fought 
to recruit and then support — 
both academically and socially — 
the University’s minority 
students. From a five-week, pre­
enrollment program to academic 
tracking to tutoring to job 
placement, CMAP works with its 
students throughout their entire 
academic careers.
To mark its anniversary, CMAP 
held an anniversary celebration 
for its students, alumni, faculty, 
and staff last Saturday in the 
Faculty Dining Room. Attended 
by over 100 people, the banquet
campus’ largest divisions — 
Greek, non-Greek, graduate, and 
undergraduate—would be finan­
cially as well as socially mandated.
Next, while fewer Greeks are 
involved in non-Greek organiza­
tions by definition, the Greek com­
munity is by no means separate 
from the rest of campus. Consider 
organizations like theStudent Un­
ion, WRCT, The Tartan, and AB: 
these four organizations receive a 
large part of Senate’s funds and 
the whole campus—regardless of 
social affiliation — benefits from 
their services. Why should the 
Greeks not bear their part of these 
costs?
This makes us wonder why the 
author of the proposal is really 
asking for such a large payback. 
The proposal says that “it was 
written to help eliminate the cur­
rent ‘pissed-off feeling felt by 
many of us Greeks about the fact 
that several thousand dollars of 
our activities fee is being given to 
independent buggy organiza­
tions.”
If Greeks are upset about money 
being allocated to build buggies, 
they should talk to their Senate 
representatives instead of restruc­
turing the entire funding process.
Finally, if this proposal were 
approved, how long would be be­
fore the activity monies were 
funnelled to the Greeks’ social 
budgets? GSO controls nearly 
$60,000 which it spends on noth­
ing but parties. That’s a worri­
some precedent.
Considering these points, we 
cannot support this proposal. 
While we are sensitive to the 
Greeks’ situation, we wonder if 
this isn’t a case of fixin’ what ain’t 
broke.

Unfortunately, the program’s job 
isn’t any easier now than it was in

uphill battle.

I read with interest and enjoyment the 
feature article dealing with the noctur­
nal tour and early occupancy of our new 
dorms [“Student spends first night in 
new dorm,” 1/24].
Since Physical Plant is responsible for 
the construction, the article also caused 
considerable concern for the safety of our 
overnight guest and any others inspired 
to take an unauthorized tour. A con­
struction site is a hazardous place, even 
in normal daylight working hours.

Recently while reading through some 
old Tartans, I came upon the recent ATO/ 
Airband letters [“ATO Defends Airband. 
Behavior” 1/24; “Airband critic answers 
ATO’s comments” 1/31]. In case you’ve 
forgotten, Kevin Barney had written to 
The Tartan to complain about ATO’s 
actions during Airband. An ATO brother 
responded in the next issue, and Kevin 
followed with an apology. Reading these 
letters made me think of the statistics 
recitation I recently attended. Several 
ATO brothers sat behind me, including 
Peter Papagianakis, the author of ATO’s 
defense in The Tartan. The group was 
talking loudly and continued to do so 
after the recitation had started. Because 
of their noise, I couldn’t hear the TA, but 
I waited a few minutes hoping they would 
quiet down on their own. No doubt this
Editor:
I was employed by General Motors in 
1983. The company was already in 
trouble, but my managers did not seri­
ously consider suggestions to changing 
the ways they were conducting business. 
Consequently, GM hit some extremely 
hard times a few years later, from which 
they have yet to recover.
My managers’ attitudes back in 1983 
are very similar to the attitudes of GSIA’s 
administration. Particularly bothersome 
are statements like “It is not by any 
means (seen as) a damaging blow by me.” 
(Dean Baybars’ response to the recent 
Business Week article ranking business 
schools).
It is true that the method of surveying 
BW used was not scientific, but the ar­
ticle will influence the public’s percep­
tion of GSIA in a negative manner. And 
any marketing student knows that when 
you are trying to sell something, it is the 
perceived value that is important, not 
the true value. Perhaps the BW article 
ought to bother Dean Baybars more than 
it does.
Why does GSIA’s administration drag 
its feet whenever suggestions to improve 
the MSIA program are made?. Why were 
decisions to form student committees to 
review the MSIA curriculum and to place 
stronger emphasis on quality teaching 
standards not made until the BW article 
appeared (though students have been 
making these suggestions for years)?
There are many problems at GSIA but 
the administration seems slow to re­
spond. The school is plagued with profes­
sors who have little instructional skill. 
The MSIA curriculum does not have 
much synergy among its courses; rather, 
it seems like a large, directionless vol-

injury will be avoided by the craftsmen

any of us on the campus would want is to 
have a student injured who couldn’t resist 
saying, “I slept there, too.”

injury, the University has instituted site

as well. When the several minutes had 
passed and they showed no sign of stop­
ping, I turned to them and said, “Would 
you mind keeping it down? I’m trying to 
listen to the recitation.”
There was a sudden silence quickly 
followed by a low stream of curses aimed 
in my direction. I turned around to face 
Papagianakis, the source of the offend­
ing remarks and asked him what was 
wrong. He said, “F*cking a**hole, you 
could have been more polite about it, 
Peking jerk.” I turned back to the recita­
tion, but Papagianakis’ indignation con­
tinued for some time. While my request 
wasn’t exemplatory of Miss Manners, it 
certainly didn’t equal the rudeness of 
their original actions or ofPapagianakis’ 
comments.

ume of material. With the group work 
emphasis of the MSIA program, it is 
impossible to schedule space for meet­
ings — a quality of life issue ignored 
when the decision was made to increase 
the size of the student body before extra 
facilities were created. My high school 
could have done a better job of admini­
stering the Management Game than 
GSIA did. (It is interesting to note that 
an “unscientific” method similar to that 
used by BW to rank business schools is 
used to assign grades for the Manage­
ment Game). Our alumni base is so weak 
that it is almost nonexistent—the latest 
annual fund raising drive at GSIA 
managed to come up with less than 
$300,000 in 6 months (whereas millions 
of dollars were raised in the same time 
periodby Northwestern). The school does 
not market itself well — not many out­
side of GSIA seem to know that the 
school is strong in numerous areas be­
sides manufacturing.
With so many problems, why did GSIA’s 
administration wait to take action until 
a magazine publicized our weaknesses? 
Why didn’t they listen to their students 
when these issues were raised years 
earlier? Had the administration re­
sponded to these issues when students 
brought them up, they could have been 
dealt within the private forum of the
security during the non-working hours! 
To keep the campus up to date on the 
project, Physical Plant would be glad to 
provide The Tartan with progress pho­
tos or a brief weekly bulletin updating 
our progress and problems with the 
construction.
We are open to other suggestions on 
ways that we can help the campus com­
munity keep better informed about onr 
work on this project.

he wrote,
“My final question is directed to Keuin 
Barney. Why couldn’t you simply ap­
proach and kindly ask my brothers to 
keep it down while Ron Darian was doing 
his performance ? MY brothers would havi 
gladly cooperated without, and I empha­
size, without, any further developments' 
Why indeed didn’t Kevin ask your 
brothers to keep it down during a rowdy 
event when you can’t even control your­
self in a stats recitation? I don’t know 
who you think you are, Peter Pa­
pagianakis, but the rest of the Univer­
sity doesn’t have to put up with this kind 
of behavior.
Kevin Barney, you extended your 
apology far too soon.

school. Instead, our dirty laundry is aired 
in public to the detriment of students, 
faculty, and GSIA’s reputation. The 
administration is behaving just as the 
management of GM did before GM’s big 
trouble started.
Just as the business environment for 
companies became more competitive, the 
competition for the top ranks for busi­
ness schools is also becoming more com­
petitive. Doing research is not enough 
for a top ten ranking. Excellent teaching 
standards, a coherent curriculum (re­
viewed annually by faculty and students), 
a strong alumni base, and a well mar­
keted public image (stressing academic 
specialties ) will be the minimum require­
ments for a good business school.
The administration of GSIA has been 
so unresponsive in the past that I won­
der if they are capable of managing oui 
school to a top rank amidst increased 
competition from other schools. I dont 
know a single student in my class that 
feels that the administration is doing! 
good job. If the administration doesnt 
miraculously improve their managerial 
skills, GSIA may join the unenviable 
ranks of organizations such as General 
Motors.

KW.. tAcxcr
Friday, January 20, 1989 
marked a sad day for American 
politics. I say that not because 
George Bush was inaugurated but 
because former President Reagan 
left office.
Anytime a president who has 
achieved a 63% popularity rating 
for eight years of service leaves, it 
is sad. Reagan managed to pull 
the highest popularity in the last 
30 years—one that many Ameri­
cans will not soon forget. I hope 
you didn’t cry too much when 
1 Ronald Reagan flew off into the 
Californian sunset.
Seeing Reagan go was some­
thing like watching your grand­
father move away. Since most of 
us grew up under Reagan, we 
have come to expect his conserva­
tive presence. Like him or not, 
you must admit he possessed a 
certain optimism, charisma, and 
conviction that few presidents 
have ever had.
Just as a person begins to un­
derstand, respect, and appreciate 
his grandfather as he grows up, I 
now admire Ronald Reagan more
now than I did at the beginning of 
his presidency.
I didn’t know much about Re­
agan in 1980—and I really didn’t 
care to. The left-leaning media 
influenced my decisions then more 
than I realized. With only NBC, 
ABC, and CBS to inform me, I 
was completely unaware of the 
one-sided view of the election I 
was receiving. Young, naive, and 
liberal-moderate, I supported the 
third party independent John 
Anderson. Boy, was I ever naive!
In 1984,1 changed to a moder­
ate-conservative. This change was 
caused as a consequence of be­
coming a social conservative. I 
became pro-capital punishment, 
pro-school prayer, and anti-abor- 
tion. Agreeing with Reagan on 
these issues, I had no reserva­
tions about voting for him.
Since 1984, I have completed 
my ideological transformation by 
adopting conservative positions 
on economic and foreign policy is­
sues. Why the shift to a hard-line 
right-wing ideology? The answer 
is simple: liberalism.
That’s right. The liberalism in 
America was largely responsible 
for my change. When I saw how 
harmful liberal policies are for 
America, I turned to the time-
“I didn't know Ronald Reagan in 
1980 R and I really didn't care to.
The left-leaning media influenced my 
decisions then more than I realized. 
With only NBC, ABC, and CBS to in­
form me, I was ... unaware of the one­
sided view... I was receiving.”
tested values of conservatism. 
Now I can truly appreciate hav­
ing had an avowed, outspoken 
conservative in the White House.
I do, however, disagree with a 
few things that have happened 
under Reagan’s presidency. The 
Iran-Contra scandal, astrological 
advisors, and a greatly increased 
budget and national deficit top 
the list.
On the other hand, there is 
much to be thankful for. I appre­
ciate a stronger national defense.
I appreciate supply-side economic 
policies which call for lower taxa­
tion. I appreciate inflation and 
unemployment rates that are 
below six percent. I appreciate a 
conservative Supreme Court that
understands it should interpret 
laws and not make them. I appre­
ciate a government that is slow­
ing in its growth and in regula­
tory power. I appreciate improved 
relations with the Soviet Union. I 
appreciate the largest peace-time 
economic build-up in United 
States history. And, perhaps most 
of all, I appreciate the long-stand­
ing peace our great nation enjoys.
Instead of giving our genera­
tion a war to be drafted into, 
Ronald Reagan gave us jobs to 
graduate into. That is the Reagan 
legacy which we can all appreci­
ate, and for that we thank him.

"YOU WERE WITH MR. REAGAN'S PAKTY?
Chair takes exception to editorial’s comments
Editor:
Hello, my name is Glenn 
Kornbrek. I am a fifth year archi­
tecture student and have served 
on the Carnegie Mellon Student 
Senate for four years. When I’m 
not out castrating Student Gov­
ernment Presidents, I serve as 
chair of the Student Senate. I am 
writing this letter in response to 
the “Forum” editorial printed in 
last week’s Tartan [“Senate’s Busy 
Week” 1/31].
Most people work on the basic 
assumption that something writ­
ten in a newspaper is factual, 
accurate, and professional. It is 
truly unfortunate that the edito­
rial written last week by editor- 
in-chief Barnhart, and supported 
by the editorial board, met none 
of these criteria. In this editorial, 
Mr. Barnhart accuses me of eve­
rything from constitutional im­
propriety to incompetence to a 
general lack of personality.
The first issue Mr. Barnhart 
raises is that President 
Robitshek’s Presidential Search 
Student Sub-Committee is an 
“external” committee. The com­
mittee is “external” in the sense 
that it is not affiliated with any 
other organization, but in terms 
of precedent and current usage,
this is no external committee. The 
purpose of a Presidential Exter­
nal Committee is to look into a 
particular issue, or to provide 
assistance to the Student Gov­
ernment President in accomplish­
ing his goals. The problem with 
calling the Presidential Search 
Committee an “external commit­
tee” is that it implies that this 
committee reports directly to 
President Robitshek and that the 
committee has only the power to 
do exactly what he asks. A cur­
rent example of a current exter­
nal committee is the Enthusiasm 
Committee.
The Presidential Search Stu­
dent Sub-Committee was in­
tended be free to pursue its rec­
ommendations with complete 
autonomy and answer only to the 
student body which they repre­
sent. To call this an “external 
committee” is to imply that the 
members of the committee are 
representatives of President Ro­
bitshek, not representatives of the 
student body. This is why I stated 
that in the traditional sense of 
the term, this is not an external 
committee.
Another constitutional issue 
Mr. Barnhart raises is that the 
Chair of Student Senate has no
•WxxWcw xr xMW Fm-xrc­­­­­­­
explicit right to call “special 
meetings.” Mr. Barnhart, please 
do not be absurd. If one continued 
this line of argument to its ridicu­
lous conclusion one could say that 
the Chair has no explicit right to 
call even a “regular meeting” of 
Senate. The Constitution does not 
give anyone the explicit right to 
call “regular meetings.” Would 
Mr. Barnhart have the Student 
Senate never meet at all? The fact 
of the matter is that both of these 
roles are implicitly given to the 
Student Senate Chair. The job of 
Chair includes: calling meetings, 
setting agenda, setting dates for 
Student Senate elections, presid­
ing over meetings, and deciding 
issues of parliamentary proce­
dure. The very idea that the Stu­
dent Government President, 
leader of the executive branch, 
would have more authority over 
calling special meetings of the 
Student Senate, the legislative 
branch, than the Chair of Stu­
dent Senate, leader of the legisla­
tive branch, is simply illogical. 
Furthermore, at the beginning of 
Sunday’s “special meeting” I
clearly stated that if anyone had 
a problem with my decision to call 
this meeting, that s/he should 
motion to appeal the decision of 
the Chair. There was no motion to 
appeal my decision.
I will now address Mr. 
Barnhart’s characterization of me 
as incompetent. The point was 
made in both writing and cartoon 
form that I had did not run the 
“special meeting” with an iron 
fist and that parliamentary pro­
cedure was not strictly adhered 
to. That was precisely the point, 
Mr. Barnhart. To quote Alice 
Sturgis, an authority on parlia- 
liamentary procedure: “Informal 
discussion often brings under­
standing and agreement and 
makes evident how the motion 
should be worded.” The Sunday 
meeting produced a compromise 
which, as you may know by now, 
passed smoothly through the 
“regular meeting” this past Tues­
day. Mr. Barnhart further im­
plies that it is somehow my fault 
that the Resolution which passed 
at the January 24th “regular 
meeting” was not perfect, and that 
a few freshman members did not 
fully understand how to propose 
amendments. The Chair of Sen­
ate cannot move motions, second
motions, amend motions, or read 
minds. None of the freshman 
members asked any questions 
when the motion was passed. 
When I learned that a number of 
members were unsure of what 
was voted on and did not fully 
understand all aspects of Parlia­
mentary Procedure, I immedi­
ately scheduled a one-hour ses­
sion on Parliamentary Procedure 
at the Senate Retreat just three 
days later.
Finally, I would like to address 
Mr. Barnhart’s statement indi­
cating I lack a strong personality.
I would like to point out that not 
only is this statement rude and 
untrue, it is character defama­
tion. Further, it seems peculiar to 
me, that considering that Mr. 
Barnhart has never met me, that 
[sic] he would be able to make 
such a statement at all. It is un­
fortunate that once a slanderous 
statement such as this is stated 
in a public forum it is nearly im­
possible to retract, and there is 
forever created a cloud over the 
victim’s head. As I said earlier, 
most people assume that newspa­
pers don’t lie.

Editor:
When Student Senators are 
irresponsible, uninformed, incom­
petent, or use our position for 
personal benefit we can be re­
moved. Perhaps there should be a 
similar system for the student 
newspaper editors. Last week’s 
Forum, with Karl Barnhart’s 
“scathing” editorial [“Senate’s 
busy week” 1/31] and Dave Levy’s 
[“Robitshek is just doing his job” 
1/31] and Jonathan Levy’s [“Trust 
your student reps.. .”1/31] follow- 
up punches, painted a grossly in­
accurate picture ofthe events sur­
rounding the debate over the 
Student Presidential Search 
Subcommittee.
Last Sunday’s emergency meet­
ing of the Student Senate accom­
plished more for Senate, and more 
importantly for CMU students, 
than perhaps any other Senate 
meeting in recent memory. For 
the first time, Senate as a whole, 
along with Student Government 
President Andrew Robitshek, sat 
down and discussed an issue until 
We arrived at a solution everyone 
could live with. Mr. Barnhart took 
Pains to criticize this solution, 
Putting mocking quotes around 
the word compromise. Mr. 
Barnhart, there is nothing wrong 
with a compromise. It signifies 
that opposing parties have used 
their respective brains to achieve 
a rational, workable solution in a 
flexible, non-antagonistic man- 
ner- In addition, this “compro­
mise” was identical to the final 
resolution that passed in Senate
last Tuesday by a vote of 24-3, 
with a guarantee of no veto from 
Robitshek. We are lucky enough 
to have in Glenn Kornbrek a Chair 
of Senate who had the courage to 
be unorthodox and foster an at­
mosphere of conciliation. All The 
Tartan sees, however, is red. You 
were out for blood, Mr. Barnhart, 
and you drew it; in doing so, you 
and the five other Tartan staffers 
at the meeting completely missed 
the point: the meeting worked, 
Mr. Barnhart. Isn’t that what 
we’re all supposed to want?
As far as the actual occurrence 
of the meeting, you claim that it 
should never have happened. 
Kornbrek supposedly did not have 
the authority to call it. Think 
about the logic behind prohibit­
ing the Chair of a body from call­
ing its meetings, Mr. Barnhart. 
This is analogous to the United 
States Congress not being able to 
meet unless President Bush gave 
them permission to do so. In 
addition, no one would dare tell a 
Senate Committee Chair that s/ 
he has no right to call committee 
meetings, even though that right 
is not explicitly stated in the 
constitution. This logic follows 
with respect to the Senate as a 
whole and its Chair.
Next you claim that “unbelieva­
bly, Senate didn’t even talk to the 
President before calling its ‘emer­
gency meeting.” In fact, Robitshek 
was the first person called and 
the fifth one reached in reference 
to the meeting. Had he objected to 
the meeting or refused to attend,
the meeting would never have 
occurred. His hands were not tied 
by anyone or anything, save his 
conscience. Also, Matthew Ruben, 
the original resolution’s sponsor, 
called Robitshek no less than five 
times in the three days before the 
original resolution was intro­
duced. He asked Robitshek to 
come to the meeting, and when 
Robitshek declined, Ruben read 
him the entire document over the 
telephone. Mr. Robitshek liter­
ally said nothing on the subject. 
Mr. Robitshek, on the other hand, 
notified no one outside of the 
Search Subcommittee of the 
committee’s formation until it was 
a fait accompli. The student popu­
lation at large did not find out 
about the Committee until The 
Tartan printed a story on it. At 
At this time, all members of the 
committee had already been cho­
sen. Now, who was not communi­
cating with whom? You use our 
slogan, “Working together we get 
things done” to mock the sup­
posed lack of communication with 
Robitshek, when in reality work­
ing together as we did on Sunday 
was the only way that anything 
got done.
You fail to realize, Mr. 
Barnhart, that the goal of the 
original Senate resolution was 
increased communication. We felt 
that the choosing of this commit­
tee was too important to the fu­
ture of this University to allow it 
to remain solely in the hands of 
thë Student Government Presi­
dent and a few organizations.
What we wanted from the sub­
committee was the opportunity 
for any interested student to have 
a chance to be on this committee. 
This is precisely what the origi­
nal resolution accomplished, and 
thankfully what the final one 
retained. To call either resolution 
weak in light ofthe previous state­
ment is to imply that student 
involvement is in itself a weak 
concept. Hopefully, you’ll have to 
answer to the student body for 
that, Mr. Barnhart.
You chastise us for “castrating” 
Mr. Robitshek. Ironically itis you, 
Mr. Barnhart, not we, who do him 
a disservice. All three Forum 
articles harp on the fact that 
Robitshek has the exclusive right 
to create external committees. 
Whether he does ornot, whatThe 
Tartan’s argument boils down to 
is that Robitshek was justified in 
creating the committee because 
he had the power to do so. You 
claim, in short, that he did it 
because he could. We feel differ­
ently. Mr. Robitshek was search­
ing for a way to accommodate the 
students he represents. We, also 
being student representatives, 
disagreed with his method and 
suggested a new one via a resolu­
tion. Robitshek could have ignored 
us; he could have pulled rank and 
proceeded with the original com­
mittee. Instead, he saw that many 
students were unhappy and was 
willing to help remedy the situ­
ation. You criticize Senate for 
infringing on Robitshek’s author­
ity. However, no one forced him to
give in to some of our wishes — he 
did it himself. Thus, you, Mr. 
Barnhart, unwittingly portray 
him as weak for compromising; 
you, Mr. Barnhart, have castrated 
the Student Government Presi­
dent. Heaven help him.
Finally, Mr. Barnhart, the eth­
ics behind your reasons for writ­
ing the editorial seem flimsy. 
Consider: the Tartan member of 
the Committee was included in 
neither the initial nor the final 
resolution drafted by Senate; Karl 
Barnhart was the person the 
Tartan nominated. One can eas­
ily view your bitch-and-moan 
editorial is a bad case of prima 
donna sour grapes. It is a shame 
that you cannot refute that claim 
with any sort of proof, Mr. 
Barnhart, because when you go 
down, The Tartan goes down with 
you. That burden, Mr. Barnhart, 
is one that each of us is glad s/he 
does not have to bear.
We stand by our resolution, and 
we stand by the principle of full 
and open student involvement in 
University issues.

Editor’s Reply:
The Tartan’s editorial is 
the official opinion of the 
Editorial Board as a whole
— 25 people, not just one. 
Columns are the opinions 
of the individual authors.
The point ofthe editorial 
was that the meeting was 
poorly run and did not 
facilitate compromise; the 
compromise was reached 
after a 15-minute intermis­
sion was called, during 
which the few key players 
—including Dean Lois Cox
— ironed out their dif­
ferences. The rest of Senate 
simply followed behind. 
The intermission, by the 
way, was suggested by a 
Senator, not by Kornbrek.
Also, the five Chairs ne­
glected to explain that the 
reason Robitshek “de­
clined” to appear at the 
regularly scheduled Sen­
ate meeting was because 
he had to attend class. And, 
in fact, he did object to the 
“emergency” meeting.
In addition, if the five 
Chairs think the search 
committee is “too important 
... to remain solely in the 
hands ofthe Student Gov­
ernment President,” are thè 
Supreme Court and Execu­
tive Cabinet too important 
to be left in the hands ofthe 
President of the United, 
States? Both Robitshek 
and the U.S. president are 
empowered by their respec­
tive constitutions to make, 
appointments. As students, 
we elected Robitshek for' 
two terms and should be 
confident in his abilities\ 
and actions; we should not', 
undermine them.
Finally, Senate’s con­
stitution explicitly gives the 
President the right to call a 
special meeting. If the' 
Chair also had such power,. 
the constitution would state 
so; it doesn’t. Are all un­
stated powers implicitly', 
given to the Chairman?, 
And, in fact, the Senate 
constitution does give the 
Chair the explicit right to 
“decide ... the time and 
place of [a regular] meet­
ing.”
The Forum pages have a ' 
single purpose: to present 
the opinions of anyone who 
wishes to express them. You 
cannot criticize opinions 
other than by disagreeing 
with them.
The Tartan unequivo­
cally stands behind its ' 
editorial.

SportspeakMen’s team extends winning streak
Balance IM
We here at CMU are very for­
tunate to have such a strong 
intramural program. A student 
or group of students can take off 
for an hour and play almost 
anything. The IM department 
provides a source of rest and re­
laxation for the entire campus 
community. However, as is 
often the case with any good 
thing, a few “bad apples” are 
ruining a good thing for all.
At one time, Greeks domi­
nated the IM rosters. However, 
in the last few years, 
[GD]Independents have been 
swelling the IM ranks. I do not 
mean to say that IM has degen­
erated down to a competition 
between the Greeks and the 
! [GDJIndependents. This is far 
: from accurate. Instead, the 
. large number of teams has 
caused many groups (Greek and 
others) to “load up” the lower 
divisions. This undermines the 
; whole idea of the program.
! Almost every sport has three 
' divisions: Major, Intermediate,
, and Minor. Each team has the 
: option to be in any one of these, 
i Since the Minor division hap- 
; pens to be the easiest in terms 
; of competition, most teams 
; choose to play in Minors.
The upper divisions of Inter- 
; mediates and Majors are for 
! those teams who want the 
! really tough competition. Five 
! guys who live in the same dorm 
' and don’t get a chance to play
- that often are not that likely to
1 sign up for Majors. Even less 
¡ likely to sign up for the upper 
¡ divisions is a group not all that 
‘ familiar with the game in the 
! first place. A little fun and exer- 
! cise — these are the reasons 
! why people play IM, and why
* they play Minors.
; There’s nothing wrong with 
; this. Competition is important.
! The saying, “sports build char- 
! acter” is somewhat of a cliché,
! but it is often accurate.
! Large groups have a lot of 
' people in them who all want to 
¡ play in a particular sport. Most 
; people don’t want to be on a 
; team with 12 others — a person 
¡ would have less of an opportu- 
! nity to play, if at all. Therefore, 
most groups have three or more 
teams representing them. They 
then put one team (or more) in 
each of the divisions.
This would be just fine except 
that, in order to insure a playoff 
spot, the best teams are often 
placed in the Minors division. 
This is when the problems 
start. A true Minors team is im­
mediately knocked out of the 
running by a team that should 
be placed in one of the upper 
divisions.
This may seem a petty gripe, 
but the idea is not just that it 
deprives certain players from 
competition on their own level, 
but such situations can be dan­
gerous. Competition can be a 
powerful motivator. A stronger 
team can take its toll on a 
weaker, less experienced team. 
¡This is especially evident in the 
contact sports. Unnecessary 
[roughness is rampant in such 
uneven” games.
The problem does not lie 
¡ within the IM Department; it 
can’t determine if a team truly 
belongs in a certain division.
But pressure should be put on 
¡those teams, as witnessed by 
! the referees, that visibly belong 
¡ln a higher division.
Sportsmanship should be the 
Primary goal of any IM player 
and team, not simply the desire 
to win.

Tartan Contributing Editor
There’s nothing like the bottom 
of the President’s Athletic Con­
ference to change your fortunes. 
The Tartan (7-11, 5-2 PAC) win 
streak is now up to four games, 
and the men are one game behind 
conference leader Grove City.
The latest victims were cellar- 
dwellers Bethany and Hiram. 
Carnegie Mellon coasted to its 92- 
77 victory over the hapless Bi- 
sons, but barely survived Tim 
Tallbacka, Mark Phelps and the 
Hiram Terriers. The Tartans 
scored 10 unanswered points in 
the final 63 seconds for a stun­
ning 70-69 come-from-behind 
victory.
After three straight laughers, 
CMU quickly found itself in a 
game against the Terriers. The 
Hiram offense has changed little 
since the days of Rod Swartz and 
his 32 points per game average— 
“shoot ’em high and long.”
Hiram’s bombers came out fir­
ing, hitting six first-half three- 
pointers, building a lead as big as
11 points after a 13-3 run late in 
the half. The Tartans narrowed 
the gap, and trailed at the half, 
38-33.
Neither team made a move until 
midway through the second half. 
Then suddenly, the Terriers made 
their move. Four unanswered 
buckets, three from three-point 
range, swelled the Hiram lead to 
65-49.
The game was far from over. 
CMU got the next eight points to 
cut the Terrier lead in half and
the Hiram offense collapsed. The 
Tartan defense denied them any 
shots and poor free throw shoot­
ing kept them from icing the game.
And then for the second time 
this season, a miracle comeback 
occurred. Robert Sechan hit a 
three-pointer to bring Carnegie 
Mellon within seven with 63 sec­
onds to go. Nineteen seconds later, 
the freshman had another two 
points and the Hiram lead was 
down to five.
On the inbound, Hiram’s fresh­
man center Terry Peterson was 
fouled. He missed the front end of 
the one-and-one and the Tartans 
got the ball back. With 19 seconds 
to go, Gary Breauninger hit an­
other three-pointer, and the score 
stood at 69-67. Again Peterson 
was fouled, again he missed the 
free-throw; eight seconds were 
left.
The Tartans brought the ball 
up for the final shot, looking for 
designated three-point shooter 
Sechan. As time ran out, Breaun­
inger found senior co-captain 
Darryl Long instead. Long’s three- 
point shot hit with one second to 
go, and CMU won, 70-69.
The week’s earlier game lacked 
the drama of the Hiram contest. 
Against Bethany, Carnegie Mel­
lon played on cruise control and 
never looked back.
For the third straight contest, 
the team jumped out to an early 
double digit lead, shutting out 
the Bisons 11-0 over the first three 
minutes. The Bisons closed within 
two on three-pointers by Bill 
Gallagher and Chris Geruschat, 
but the Tartans quickly regained
control and led 44-31 at the half.
The second half almost seemed 
like an afterthought. Carnegie 
Mellon built its biggest lead of the 
season, 22 points with solid shoot­
ing from both the floor and the 
free-throw line. By the time it 
was over, the team shot a blister­
ing 82 percent from the charity 
stripe, and cruised to a 92-77 
victory.
Next Week: Things get more 
difficult for the Tartans as they 
travel to Cleveland and St. Louis 
for key conference games in both 
the PAC and the University Ath­
letic Association (UAA).
Wednesday, it’s a rematch with 
John Carroll. The Blue Streaks 
defeated the Tartans 76-62 in 
their PAC opener at Skibo Gym, 
behind freshman Matt Zappitelli’s 
23 points.
John Carroll is a game behind 
CMU in the PAC race, and is 
shooting for its fourth consecu­
tive PAC title in its final season of 
conference competition.
Saturday, the Tartans return 
to the Washington University 
field house in St. Louis to the 
sight of last season’s worst de­
feat. BehindAll-American Kevin 
Suiter and Academic All-Ameri- 
can Paul Jackson, the Bears 
pummeled CMU, 81-46.
Two and. a half weeks ago, 
Washington edged the Tartans 
59-57 when Carnegie Mellon hit a 
9 for 24 cold spell in the second 
half.
Both games will be on WRCT 
(88.3 FM). Wednesday’s game will 
begin at 7:00 pm, and Saturday’s 
at 8:30 pm.
Women’s PAC record goes to 8-0

The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
basketball team received a scare 
last week, but preserved their re­
gional ranking with two Presi­
dents’ Athletic Conference (PAC)
victories, 61-59 over Bethany Col­
lege and 67-56 over Hiram Col­
lege. The two wins move the Lady 
Tartans to an impressive 15-4 (8-
0 PAC) record, and will preserve 
their Mid-Atlantic regional rank­
ing. Carnegie Mellon has won

Men’s track team prepares 
indoors for outdoor season
By LEN O’NEAL
Tartan Staffwriter
With two indoor meets behind 
them, it’s sufficient to say that 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s track 
team is definitely “back on track.” 
Although it’s early in the season, 
and the team has been competing 
against a majority of Division I 
and II schools at the meets, there 
have been several bright spots.
After competing in an open meet 
at Robert Morris University on 
Sunday, January 29, the team 
travelled to Slippery Rock Uni­
versity last Saturday for another 
meet against Walsh College, 
Robert Morris, California Univer­
sity of PA and Wooster College. In 
an open meet, there is no winning 
team; competitors vie for individ­
ual honors.
In the distance events, junior 
Dave Supp picked up right where 
he left off from his excellent cross­
country season. Supp finished 
second in the mile with a time of 
4:28, and came back later to win 
the 1000 yard dash. Finishing 
behind Supp, garnering fourth 
place in both events was one of 
the Tartans’ many talented fresh­
men, Jonathan Frieder.
In the 600 yard dash, junior 
Len O’Neal raced to a sixth place 
finish in a time of 1:19, while 
senior Pat Noll and freshmen 
Mike Damon and Russ Shorkey 
all had sub-ten minute perform­
ances in the two mile event.
With the addition of Chris 
Cyrus, a freshman from Cleve­
land, Ohio, the sprinting area of
the track squad has acquired a 
big boost. Cyrus raced to fine 
performances in the 55, 300, and 
400 yard dashes. Right behind 
Cyrus were sophomore Jeff Illian 
and freshman Jeff Paliama. 
Paliama is also expected to add 
some strength to the team in the 
jumping events.
“The team is quite talented, 
despite its size, but we’re always 
looking for more people to join the 
team. It will only make us a bet­
ter team,” remarked a member.
The Tartans are using the in­
door meets primarily to get them­
selves ready for the University 
Athletic Association Indoor 
Championships to be held at the 
University of Chicago (March 3- 
4) and to prepare themselves for 
the upcoming outdoor season.

11 games. The Lady Tartans are 
third in the region, with the top 
four teams going to the NCAA 
playoffs in March.
Against Hiram last Saturday, 
the Lady Tartans played a very 
typical 1988-89 game: take a big 
lead and coast to an easy win. 
Carnegie Mellon exploded in the 
second half, extending their 33- 
28 half-time lead to 54-31 with 10 
minutes left in the game. Lisa 
Smith returned to the lineup by 
scoring 13 points. She was out for 
a game with bruised ribs. Amy 
Buxbaum also had 13 points and 
added 10 rebounds to pace CMU.
“It felt good to win. We haven’t 
had a good game in the last five 
games,” said Buxbaum. “Coming 
back and starting classes put us 
down a little bit, but now we’re 
getting back into the groove.”
Lisa Lightner had 11 points for 
the Lady Tartans, and 10 points 
were put in by Heather O’Donnell.
Hiram’s Rhonda Prisby led the 
Terriers with 14 points and added
11 rebounds to the Hiram effort. 
Dawn Martin and Michelle Drum­
mond each added 12 points and
11 rebounds, and Alisa Kemp 
canned 11 for Hiram.

Women yr 1-1 for the week...
Men’s swim team 
stays undefeated
By JOEY LYNN MONACO
Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Swim Teams faced off against Slippery 
Rock and John Carroll (JCU) this week and walked away with 
three out of four possible wins.
Three swimmers set new school records. At Tuesday’s meet, 
Glynis Frost broke the 500 yd. freestyle record with a time of 
5:35.15, only to break it again at Saturday’s meet (5:31.73). She 
also set a new record in the 1000 yd. freestyle (11:29.17). Jo 
Wollschlaeger set a new record in the 200 yd. individual medley 
(IM), finishing it in 2:18.99. Wollschlaeger also set new pool 
records in the 200yd. IM (2:18.99), the 200yd. butterfly (2:13.94), 
and the 200 yd. breaststroke (2:34.39). For the men, Brian Zim­
merman set a new record for the 500 yd. freestyle.
Saturday’s meet was a challenge for the women, who beat JCU, 
124-110. Triple winners for the women’s team were Frost in the 
200yd. freestyle (11:29.17), the 200yd. IM(2:05.23), and the 500 
yd. freestyle, and Wollschlaeger in the 400 yd. medley relay, the 
200yd. butterfly (2:20.35), and the 200yd. breaststroke (2:36.76). 
Other notable performances included Debbie “Mad Dog” Mad­
sen, who came from three lengths behind to take second in the 
200 yd. butterfly, and Tiffany Pickering, who, despite illness, 
took third in the 500 yd. freestyle.
“It was a terrific win for our women. Both coaches thought the 
meet would be dead even,” said Coach Jim Perkins. “Due to us 
swimming exceptionally well, we won.”
The men’s team also swam well, beating JCU 135-97. Zimmer­
man was a triple winner—in the 500 yd. freestyle (4:50.48), the 
50 yd. freestyle (23.36), and the medley relay. Pat Hensler, in the 
words of a teammate, “swims anything.” His versatility aided the 
men in their victory in the medley relay and the 400 yd. freestyle. 
The victory puts the men’s team at 6-0.
Last Tuesday’s meet against Slippery Rock, however, came 
close to being their first loss. The final score for the men was 103- 
102; the battle raged down to the last race. According to swimmer 
Hal Levine, “We weren’t supposed to win it going in ... [but] our 
emotion managed to carry us over the top.” Levine contributes a 
good part of the win to Perkins’ ability to juggle the starting 
lineup at the last minute to the best advantage of the team. The 
women lost 72-127, despite several outstanding performances.
The divers also performed well this week. They practice at Pitt 
because they cannot dive at home, but many team members feel 
that the diving program is coming together. Against John Car­
roll, diver Jody James took first place in the regular dives and 
second in the optional dives. Diver Ward Eldred mentioned that 
the team will begin learning three meter dives in the remaining 
weeks of meets. They expect a “real hard workout in the next 
couple of weeks,” and plan to do well in the University Athletic 
Association and the Presidents’ Athletic Conference champion­
ships in the weeks ahead.
The swim teams face Grove City on Saturday, February 11 at 
home. The men anticipate a difficult meet, but they consider the 
“home advantage” to be a deciding factor. The women should 
have an easier match; the seven member Grove City women’s 
team is only in its first year.

The Carnegie Mellon hockey 
club’s playoff hopes were set back 
with a heartbreaking 3-2 loss to 
Allegheny last Saturday. How­
ever, Sunday’s win against last- 
place West Virginia (WVU) 
brought them one step closer to 
one of the four playoff spots. With 
three league games to play in the 
Western Pennsylvania Club 
Hockey Association, the Tartans 
find themselves in the unenvi­
able position of having to win all 
of their remaining contests to 
guarantee a playoff berth.
Sophomore co-captain Denny 
Frey was disappointed with the 
hard luck loss, but noted that his
team was “missing a lot of play­
ers.” The poor attendance left the 
Tartans with only one line intact 
for the entire game, which con­
tributed to their inability to put 
the puck in the net. Despite goals 
by freshmen Jan-Marc Feather- 
ston and Ed Kilduff, CMU was 
left on the short end of the score 
as Allegheny scored three breaka­
way goals. Frey praised the play 
of freshman goalie Dave Sealfon. 
“He was magnificent in the net.”
Sunday’s game against the 
Mountaineers put CMU back into 
the thick of things. Five goals by 
freshman Dave Pfalzgraf paced 
the Tartans to an easy 7-4 win.
Carnegie Mellon jumped out to 
an early 3-0 lead in the first pe­
riod on two goals by Pfalzgraf and
one by Kilduff. CMU added a 
fourth goal by Todd Henderson 
and ended the period leading 4-2.
Within the first two minutes of 
the second period, the score was 
tied 4-4 on two power play goals 
by WVU. Pfalzgraf replied with 
two more goals in the second and 
one in the third period to finish 
out the scoring. A fight in front of 
the WVU net ended the game.
The win puts the club at 5-2-2, 
a record which is second to only 
Pitt, who is in first place at 9-0.
The Tartans’ big test comes 
Wednesday when they face off 
against Pitt for the second time 
this season. CMU suffered a tough 
loss the first time around, but 
Frey feels the team is more than 
capable of beating the Panthers.
Women remain undefeated in PAC
grdx-dsWm .crn uAyW aa
Against Bethany (4-14, 1-6 
; PAC), CMU played very slug- 
I gishly, and had to come from be- 
! hind to avoid an upset at Skibo 
! Gym last Wednesday.
In the first half, Carnegie Mel- 
; Ion shot only 30 percent (11/37) 
; from the field, and turned the ball 
; over 12 times. The tri-captains 
! kept CMU in the game in the first 
, half; Aimee Reber and Lightner 
each had nine points, and Beth 
• Virgin had 10 rebounds to set the 
; pace. At halftime, the score stood 
1 at 32-30 in favor of Bethany.
The second half saw much of 
the same from the Lady Tartans, 
who found themselves down by as 
many as six points 10 minutes 
into the half. Carnegie Mellon 
turned up the heat and led by six 
after a Lightner 3-pointer with 
3:25 to go.
With CMU leading 61-57, 
Bethany’s Della Trower scored 
with :04 remaining. Bethany 
forced a jump ball after CMU in­
bounded the ball, but the posses­
sion arrow favored the Tartans, 
who held on to win, 61-59.
The Lady Tartans were led by
Lightner’s 16 points, Tricia 
Chorgo’s 10 points, and Virgin’s 
10 points and 17 rebounds. Lori 
Bowersock led all scorers with 20 
points, and Shanley Reeves scored 
16 for Bethany.
This week: Carnegie Mellon 
has a big home game with fourth 
place John Carroll at Skibo Gym 
on Tuesday, February 7, starting 
at 7:00 pm. The team travels to 
St. Louis this weekend to square 
off against Washington Univer­
sity. Winning both games could 
virtually lock up a play-off berth 
for the Lady Tartans.
Pi Alpha Delta and Sig Tau pick 
up wins in Minors IM basketball
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Staffwriter
The IM basketball season con­
tinued last Thursday with con­
tests in the Minors division. Pi 
Alpha Delta (PAD) defeated Chess 
Club, 58-27, and Sigma Tau 
Gamma A (STG) slipped past 
Proud Pete, 22-20.
In the first period, PAD showed 
the Chess Club that it was not 
going to be beaten. At the end of 
the first quarter, PAD was up by 
the score of 14-6. The Chess Club 
tried to make a comeback in the 
second period with the help of 
Jim White, the team’s high scorer 
with seventeen points, but was 
unsuccessful and ended the half 
down by 11 points.
During the second half of the 
game, the Chess Club fell apart. 
It managed to score only eight 
points for the rest of the game. 
The club’s defense was no better 
as PAD scored 28 points. Basic 
errors, such as having to call out 
to a teammate twice before any­
one came back to receive the ball
as it was thrown in, hurt the Chess 
Club’s chance for a victory.
The high scorer for PAD was 
Matt Davis, who had 22 points. 
The win keeps PAD undefeated 
at 2-0. This was Chess Club’s first 
basketball game of the season.
In other action, STG met Proud 
Pete in a game that had a hard 
time getting off the ground. In the 
first period, it took a combined 
total of ten shots at the basket 
before anyone scored. Proud Pete 
took an early 4-0 lead. In the final 
seconds of the first period, STG 
scored on its fourteenth attempt 
at a basket. The first period closed 
with Proud Pete up, 5-2.
In the second quarter, Proud 
Pete scored only one point off of a 
foul shot. Late in the period, STG 
scored its second basket, knock­
ing the Proud Pete lead to two. 
When the period ended, a total of 
three points had been scored, and 
Proud Pete led 6-4. At the half, 
Proud Pete was shooting 20 per­
cent from the floor, while STG 
made 8.3 percent of its shots.
During halftime, something

happened on the STG bench. The 
team came out for the third pe­
riod of play a different team. STG 
shot six for fourteen from the field, 
improving its shooting percent­
age from an embarrassing 8.3 
percent to an astounding 42.8 
percent. Proud Pete was three for 
eight during the third period. At 
the end of the third period, STG 
led for the first time by a score of 
16-11.
Proud Pete turned the game 
around in the fourth period, scor­
ing nine straight points and re­
taking the lead, 20-16. After that 
point, STG shut down Proud 
Pete’s scoring. STG scored the 
final points of the game to win by 
a narrow two-point margin, 22- 
20. Both teams are now 1-1.
Both teams had their own prob­
lems. Proud Pete was consistently 
being called for violating the three 
second rule in the key. STG’s 
problem was shooting. The team 
was having difficulty making foul 
shots, but STG corrected its mis­
take before Proud Pete, so it 
claimed the victory.

The Carnegie Mellon Women’s 
Track season has officially be­
gun. The team has two indoor 
meets under its belt, having 
competed at Robert Morris and 
Slippery Rock in past weeks.
The first open meet took place 
at Robert Morris College against 
California University of PA, Pitt 
and Robert Morris. On the indi­
vidual level, the Tartans fared 
well against their competitors. Re­
turning for CMU are distance 
runners Sue Johnson, Kristin
Burgard, and Sue Sparks and 
sprinters Jody Burig, Julia 
Wright, and Charsetta Grant.
The majority of the team gave 
outstanding performances. Bur­
gard ran the 1500 meter in 5:22 
minutes, and Lois Roska had a 
time of 2:34 in the 800 meter.
Last week at Slippery Rock Uni­
versity, the women gained some 
valuable experience, running 
against schools like Pitt, Walsh, 
California University of PA, 
Robert Morris, and Wooster.
Sparks took fourth place in the 
two mile run with a time of 13:32. 
Wright took first place in the 60
yard hurdles (10.4 seconds).
The strength of the team is 
improving because the women are 
approaching these open meets 
with the idea of increasing their 
speed and endurance.
Johnson, who placed sixth in 
the mile with a time of 5:46, 
remarked that “we are a very 
competitive team, yet our down­
fall lies in the lack of numbers ..., 
especially the field events. To win 
a track and field championship, 
you must have strength in both.”
The next indoor meet for the 
team will be on February 19 at 
Robert Morris.

February is pitiless, and it is boring. That parade of red numerals on its 
page adds up to zero: birthdays of politicians, a holiday for rodents, what 
kind of celebrations are those? The only bubble in the flat champagne of 
February is Valentine's Day. It was no accident that our ancestors pinned 
Valentine's Day on February's shirt: he or she lucky enough to have a 
lover in frigid, antsy February has cause for celebration, indeed.
Except to the extent that it "tints the buds and swells the leaves within," 
February is as useless as the extra r in its name. It behaves like an ob­
stacle, a wedge of slush and mud and ennui, holding both progress and 
contentment at bay.
James Joyce was born in February, as was Charles Dickens and Victor 
Hugo, which goes to show that writers are poor at beginnings, although 
worse at knowing when to stop.

The BJgpsing
The day Naomi told her lover that she was 
pregnant, he went for a five mile run in the snow 
wearing shorts. She’d purposely sprung the news on him 
in the middle of the spinach souffle knowing he was 
going to choke on it. Any other way would have drawn 
nothing more than an astonished stare, and she wasn't 
about to stumble through a conversation with herself. 
Instead, she made him cough a little before he fled from 
the table in search of his sneakers.
She’d only told him because she thought he’d 
get suspicious when she started wearing tent-like tee 
shirts with huge arrows printed on them, arrows stabbing 
at her stomach and announcing BABY or PRECIOUS 
CARGO. She’d expected him to fly from the apartment 
as he had. wrapping a bandana around his round, little 
head, muttering something about discussing this later 
after he got some fresh air.
So. she helped herself to a dish of lemon jello 
and waited for him to come back in from the snow. She 
slurped on the spoon and stalked around the apartment 
kicking socks under chairs out of sight.
After Naomi had dropped the news of her 
pregnancy and Sal had returned to her with cold, soggy 
feet and a runny nose, he remarked that his fiance wasn't 
going to like this at all. Sherrie, his bride to be. was at 
home just then, probably picking out pretty invitations 
and pricing caterers. What was he going to say?
“Honey. I’m going to be a father.” Be sure to get that 
radiant glow in his eye?
"How could this happen?" he groaned.
“You mean, you don't know ?" She scraped 
cold souffle into a trash can.
“You’re not planning on having this taken care 
of. are you?" he asked.
“Taken care of?" She stopped so that she 
could stare at him.
“An abortion." he replied. She almost ex­
pected him to spell the word out for her. Maybe pull one 
of those second grade flash cards from his pocket: u-b- 
o-r-t-i-o-n. Use that word in a sentence.
"I can’t do that." she answered. “Catholics 
don’t do that. You should know we don’t. Sal."
"1 thought Catholics didn't screw around 
before they got married, either." It was the boldest thing 
she'd ever heard him say. and all she could think was 
that the shock of this was truly starting to affect him.
"Come on Sal, I’m not that Catholic." She 
smirked and blew a long finger of smoke into his face. 
She prided herself on the ability to clean bakeware and 
smoke a Camel at the same time. He glared and said 
he’d have to marry her.
"What makes you think I'm keeping it?" she 
drawled. "I certainly wouldn’t kill it. but I’m not about 
to keep it, either."
"I can’t believe you. You have to marry me.” 
She could see him already planning to have Sherrie’s 
ring enlarged a few sizes to fit her finger.
"What do you want from me, Sal? I don’t love 
you. You don't love me. And little white kids are in 
high demand these days." She ran the glass baking pan 
under a stream of steaming water.
He just stood there seriously hoping she’d 
bum her hands or drop the pan so it would shatter all 
over the floor, but she just slouched calmly against the 
sink and finished scrubbing the dish.
Naomi lived alone in a cramped, little apart­
ment in Queens. Five days a week, she sold what she 
called "funky" clothes from a tiny shop in the Village. 
Having grown up in suburbia, she was doing some­
thing she’d always dreamed about, only now it seemed 
much less glamorous. The place was dark and every­
thing looked old and dusty. The middle-aged owner 
had seen her mass of curly, dark hair and hired her 
right away. She was tall and solid, not skinny, yet 
somehow cat-like with huge green eyes that she lined 
Cleopatra-style. thick bands of black curling up at the 
edges of the lids. He thought she would draw custom­
ers and sometimes she did. She'd seen Sal one day 
touching a silky teddy trimmed with fake leopard fur.
He was fascinated by the thing, and she 
couldn't help saying. “You Tar/an?' instead of her 
usual, "Do you need any help?”
He flushed and sputtered something aboi: a
fiance.
"She Jane?" She was on a roll.
"No." he stammered, his milky eye.-, pleading 
with her.
"Oh. I’m sorry," she finished. "It's these long 
days. I gel carried away sometimes."
"This realy isn’t Sherrie's style, any way." he 
offered shoving it back onto the rack with the others.
"No? It looks great on. though." His eyes 
darted from ther floor to her face and then dropped to 
the strings of beads swinging from her loose, faded 
shirt. She thought how much he looked like a little, 
dark monkey and smiled at him. He glanced back, 
grinned and suddenly realized that he was clutching at 
the rack of lingerie behind him.

This global warming thing is keeping me up at night. Where is 
February's slush, its gray, its tragic images of death? Instead, 
we're stuck with sunny days and mild temperatures. Naturalism 
is well past, not only as a literal ideology, but as a technological 
concept. Mother Nature has handed her maternal reigns to 
Mama Industry, and the writers have to work overtime on new 
images for February.
I will not bark to you like some street side vendor of 'The 
Miracle Cure' that this issue is the cure-all, the panacea for 
society in the sweaty grasp of industry and business. I will, 
however, argue that attention to aspects of life rather than a life 
of business could only help slow our wanton pursuit of a hotter 
planet. Read and live. Become concerned with something real, 
fiction, rather than with illusory material wealth. Drink down 
our champagne offered you in this flat and lifeless month. 
Cheers...

Charlie, the driver <>l the 7.J5 ;un Inns to llhensheig. 
handles the steering wheel like he is literally making love to a 
300-pound woman. He lets out a long yawn, signalling his 
relief that his morning run is over. His next cup of eolfee will 
he a welcome sight, as it signifies his escape from the patrons 
of his bus. Charlie wishes that lie hadn't gotten Kandy started, 
and now his high-pitched, excited voice is an icepick being 
driven into his ears.
"I believe Alan's story. The Lord comes to us in 
many ways. If you cover your face and peer between the 
spaces Ixiween your lingers. God is there. If you look out 
the corner of your eye. God is there. If you look through the 
eye of a needle, then God will look hack at you. God is eve­
rywhere. A miracle has happened 011 this day. I 111. yesterday. 
And if God can he a burning hush, then he can certainly lie an 
airplane." says Randy.
"Jcez-us Christ. Kandy. I'm not talking about God 
here. Now all his buddies say that Little Jinx was twisted 
when he supposedly saw that plane crash. And no one else 
there heard anything. I just think lie's made a lool out of 
himself, and it's right there in the paper. Hveryone's talking 
about it."
There is no response. Charlie looks up in his mirror 
to see Kandy with his palms pressed together in prayer. 11 is 
eyes are closed an he mutters softly to himself Charlie shakes 
his head, and does a wide turn into the garage. I le sees Alan, 
his replacement, through the glass windows of the radio 
room. Alan stuffs the remainder of his breakfast chili dog into 
his mouth and walks out to the bus.
Alan is not looking forward to driving this morn­
ing. He pauses fora moment and reaches in his shirt pocket 
for snuff, but realizing he is going to he driving puls it back.
He shakes his head, trying to get his brain to settle back into 
its socket.
"Morning. Charlie.“
"Morning. Alan.'
"You look tired." says Alan sheepishly, detecting 
the growing smile on Charlie's face.
"Yeah, it was a tough morning. You know, all those 
airplanes dropping out of the sky. The roads are a mess.
Alan says nothing and takes over the driver's seat. 
He looks back to see the usual group that comes in from 
Hhensberg anti transfer into town, he reaches back and tries
•¡Good morning. Alan. " says l.ois.
Hello. Alan." says Charlene.

about his head.
"Well, are you all still asleep? Good morning! " he
booms.
"I li. Alan!" says Timmy.
Kandy says nothing.
"Morning. Little Jinx." says Carl. 'I low's your dad?"
This was Carl's standard greeting, always reminding 
him that he knew his lather. Liny Jenkins, or Jinx to his 
friends. I li.s father was the manager of the Transit Authority. 
Like him. Alan was boisterous, short, and heavy—keeping 
more to his stomach than he kept to himself.
lie's all right. Carl, but lie's been awful grumpy 
ever since the doctor made him quit smoking. I louml a pack 
of Chesterfields in his car the other day. I broke them all in 
half, and put them back in the box. I le about hail a lit when 
we left for lunch, pulling out all them broken cigarettes.
Alan braced himself for the Inquisition Carl was 
more likely to know about the incident than any ol them, and 
he would probably start the ball rolling. / should ban* slaved 
home, thought Alan, releasing the emergency brake. The bus 
lurched out into the streets. The morning sun reflected oil the 
icy road, so he reach-ed into his jacket mil put 011 his shades.
"Carl." says Lois, "thanks for letting me see your 
paper. Anti I listen t to that Kicky Nelson tape >011 made me.

"You're welcome. Lois. Say. him tlitl your sister's

"She's just fine. I'm going up to Pittsburgh this 
weekend to see her. They say she can be out in a week.
I ain't never been to Pittsburgh." pipes in Charlene.
"That's nice. Charlene." says Lois, anti goes back to 
reading the newspaper.
l.ois is win}! to see it. he thinks. Right on the in­
side of the front page was his picture, how could they miss it?

"I ley. look at this says Lois.
Alan let out his breath. She had probably found 
the article, and now they could let him have it and be done 
with it.
¦Reverend Feeney passed away. I le was such a

Come on. (juit Jiichint’ ami/ml. Alan wanted to say.
"Such a pity. Lois puts on the headphones of her 
walkman. The tinny strains of "Travelling Man" ride above the 
rumbling of the engine. The song has a plaintive anti distant 
quality, as if the sing-er is hoarse. “Shit, my batteries are about

And as each one gets oil. Alan looks to them for a sign of 
disapproval. Inn one by one. he is met with looks of ulter 
benevolence. Timmy anti Charlene, each offering sintcrest 
farewells, depart at Wood Street. Carl, offering his regards to 
Alan's father, smiles as he gets off in front of the hospitals.
Lois hurries off. but pauses al the steps to thank him for the 
ride.
Randy was the only one left. I le sat still, his eyes 
closed. One hand prcss-ctl the metal post in front of him. as if 
he were performing a faith healing, the other tightly clutched 
his batman lunch box.
Your slop. Randy."
Kandy's eyes snapped open. I le walketl stiffly to 
the front ol the bus. and then pausing in front of Alan, he 
turns 011 his heels to lace him.
I believe."’ says Randy. I le pivots again, and sieps 
01110 the curb. Alan watches him as he moves past the Si. 
Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, the placard outside giving 
limes lor Hpi-phany services.
Generous tears fill Alan's eyes. I le had never fell 
like (hat himself toward any man. but he knew such a feeling 
must be love. I le imagines dial he sees Charlie, the driver of 
the 7:1S am bus to Hhensherg. in the partial darkness, hassling 
old folks for proof ol their age. so that they tlitl not get their 
senior citizen's discount. Other forms were near. I lis soul

bus people. I le is conscious of. but cannot apprehend, their 
monotonous and trivial existence. I lis own identity is lading 
into the grey netherworld of television reruns anti howling 
scores: the world in which these bus people live.
A few light laps against the windshield make him 
turn. It has begun to snow, and the small warmth provided by 
the morning sunlight has disappeared in the absence of its 
source. The lime has come for him to set out on his journey 
garage-warti. Yes. the newspapers were wrong, but snow is 
general over Johnsiow11. li is falling w ells over the pilled 
roadways, the rows of houses, the empty sieel mills. It is 
falling, too. over the l.igonier Mountain, where Alan had. will)

about a wreck-etl airplane llial had gone loo far. I lis soul 
swoons slowly, as souls are apt to do. as he hears the snow 
falling, like the descent of a coin dropped into a farcbox. 
upon the drivers and the bus people.
I le reconsiders. No. the feeling he experiences is 
his stomach combatting the chili dog that he had for breakfast. 
Alan belches loutlh anil breaks into a chorus of "Travelling 
Man" as he drives back 10 1 he gaiage. loudly enough so that it

mg Sleep
Biting the flesh
inside my cheek, I pain
not to smile. I would have you undress
in silence. I would feel you looking
straight on my controlled face,
hot eyelids trembling
to their own pull, the pain 
of curiosity. Are you looking 
at me? Do your hands tremble 
with an aftershock of guilt? Facing 
an innocent undressed, 
fighting a penchant for fleshy
cherub cheeks. Or will you bend your face 
to the crook of my knee, the whitest flesh 
exposed to the gray air. Looking 
to tickle, a form of pain, 
sadistic laughter trembling 
between your teeth undressed
in a hard smile. I tremble, 
and still will not open my face 
your gray, soft flesh 
drifting, undressed.
This feac is not a pain.
It's a frierxj looking \
for a soft pillow to hide his face 
in. I would cry, tremble 
with you. Offer firm flesh 
to your apparition Undressed.
Toss aside the garments that pain 
m^shoulders, not lookipg
wherejhey may land. IMdr ess 
my mannequin shell. Wooden flesh, 
splintering away all the pains 
I've taken to avoid looking 
at your face.1 }
Eyes thrown <3pen, trembling
ft ronly for an instantjvince of pain undressed.
I look harder and harder for your facd,' . 
squinting, trembling as the sheet falls froramy flesh.

A beautiful story 
A lakeside retreat 
A modern hollow 
A purchase
Frozen water, 
a refreshing memory of life 
a perfect reflection, a flawless surface 
so smooth it could cut a diamond
Stuck In this interior I call out. With nothing to do 
except to be. To walk, think; to breath, eat. I'm locked in 
an odd prison, caged by trees and the lack of ideology.
I am only human and can only recognize air earth fire and water.
w
All of this hidden in a closet, the ether of technological time 
kept separate from what is now natural, an idealized commodity.
And as I look ahead down the path or across the lake or even to this 
unique sky, the inevitable new nature of someone else's future chills my skin

The flashlight set beside our hips cast 
light onto our chins, cheeks,

A Carnegie Mellon art professor has sparked 
an unusual controversy on ihe campus. Kath­
leen Mulcahy. the school's only glass instruc­
tor. was denied tenure last'March. and some 
students believe it is a sign of worse to come 
for the sculpture major.
More than two dozen art siudcnis spent 
Wednesday morning and afternoon protesting 
on ihe lawn of ihe College of Fine Arts. Begin­
ning at 6 am and contii’-'no rvery half hour
namely lhat glass would not be offered after 
Mulcahy. who has (aught glass at CMU for 11 
years, leaves.

for a sculpture professor. The college had

Without tnk’”

|y LOS FRANCO
'artcm Features Editor
Almost a year after the 
mtroversy involving 
le glass blowing pro- 
ram and glass profes- 
lr Kathleen Mulcahy’s 
!nure, the glass part of 
;ulpture remains an 
>tion for students, 
^cording to Webster’s 
ictionary, tenure is “the 
atus of holding one’s 
3sition on a permanent 
‘sis, granted to teach- 
S! civil personnel, etc.
1 the fulfillment of 
•ecifxed requirements.”
Tenure is status granted 
to faculty who fulfill 
requirements and are 
approved by their de­
partments that allows a 
faculty member to es­
tablish a permanent 
position.
Mulcahy’s tenure 
came up for review in 
March of 1987 and was 
denied, and though she 
still has not been 
granted tenure, she 
remains at Carnegie 
Mellon teaching glass.
According to senior 
drawing and sculpture 
major Robin Garber “All
the students (in her 
class) have written her 
letter of recommenda­
tion,” yet she still hasn’t 
been granted tenure.
Garber exclaimed that 
“If she (Mulcahy) stays, 
the program will con­
tinue: if she goes....”
Dean of CFA Akram 
Midani has stated that 
the glass program will 
continue indefinitely, 
according to Garber.
With the naming of 
Bryan Rogers as the art 
department head, Gar- 
her stated that she “feels 
positive about glass ...
more people are taking 
sculpture.” She feels 
that Garber, a sculptor, 
will be pro-sculpture 
and therefore pro-glass.
“At other programs, 
profs are interested in 
their own work, but 
Kathleen teaches by 
example and directly,” 
stated Garber.
According to Steffany 
Hannan, a junior art 
major, “glass is an ex­
cellent class, and Kath­
leen is an excellent prof.”
There is currently a 
debate as to whether 
glass is art or a craft.
Both Hannan and Gar­
ber feel that it is art.
Hannan feels that 
there is a craft element 
to glass blowing but 
states, “I would have to 
say it’s art. Anyone could 
make a sphere. But to 
make it look good, there 
is that art sense. ” 
Hannan went on to say 
that in reference to 
making glass spheres 
that Kathleen says 
“you’re using your 
breath, you’re giving of 
yourself to form this 
sphere.”
Last year on Wednes­
day, March 2, a protest 
took place held which 
involved more than two 
dozen art students.
The students pounded 
on two barrels sus­
pended over the CFA 
lawn every half hour 
starting at 6 am. Leaf­
lets were handed out by 
other students. Mulcahy 
has taught glass for 12 
years at Carnegie Mel­
lon. The protest was 
held by students who 
feared that after Mul­
cahy left the glass pro­
gram would be cut by 
the administration.

Presidential candidates reviewed in depth
I am often astounded at the 
way a modern, enlightened insti- 
¦ tution such as CMU handles the 
many obstacles that come its way. 
The most notable example of this 
is without a doubt the way the 
administration has chosen to elect 
the person who will fill the very 
large, gaping maw that will be 
left in the administration after 
,the departure of President Cyert.
The biggest surprise was the 
letter from the Registrar’s Office 
which I received soon after Cyert 
anouhced his retirement. It ex­
plained that there was a large 
gaping maw left in the admini­
stration and that my help was 
needed in order to fill it.
I soon rejected their job offer; I 
have a full course load, after all, 
but I did agree to have a look at 
some of the people to whom they 
áre offering the presidenc}' and to 
provide them with some much 
needed feedback.
I suppose that their first candi­
date is my favorite, I definitely 
think that Steve Winwood would 
make a fine president.
Not only does he have a bouncy 
optimism about him which would 
make him refreshing as a Chief 
Executive, but also a sense of style 
which I admire greatly.
After sixteen years of grey flan­
nel suits, I would definitely revel 
in watching a long-haired Win- 
wood clad in baggy pants deliver­
ing the State of the University, 
address to a conga beat and back­
ing vocals by Chaka Khan while 
dozens of scantily clad dancing 
girls carouse about him.
There would be some drawbacks 
to a Winwood, for example, he 
does have a busy touring and re- 
, cording schedule which includes 
releasing ten more solo albums 
within the next year.
Unfortunately, maintaining his 
status as rock and roll’s most over­
played musician would not be the
be the only drawback to Win- 
wood’s tenure at Warner Hall.
I think that his fund raising 
style would hinder the image of 
the school, after all, who wants to 
see their alma mater featured in
a Michelob commercial?
My doubts about President 
Winwood brought me to the next 
candidate, Lyndon LaRouche.
In running for the presidency 
of the U. S. four times in a row, 
LaRouche has definitely shown 
the dogged persistence that is 
necessary in a candidate.
LaRouche is also well known 
for his ceaseless efforts in main­
taining his credit afloat; an abil­
ity which would most certainly be 
a boon to this school, given our in­
finite fund raising needs.
Yes, a LaRouche presidency 
might be just what the Mellon 
needs, if it were not for his pen­
chant toward seeing conspiracies 
wherever he looks. I think that 
the workings of the University 
would most certainly be hindered 
if LaRouche woke up one morn­
ing and decided that Nobel Prize 
Laureate Herb Simon was in­
volved with British Prime Minis­
ter Margaret Thatcher and Na-

in the choices listed above. For 
example, although “Rin-Tin-Tin” 
definitely falls into the category 
of “cute” I personally don’t be­
lieve that he has any business 
running a major university, even 
if he was a member of the mili­
tary.
I feel the same way about invit­
ing Ronald Reagan to run the 
school, since I have already out­
lined my aversion toward having 
members of the living dead run­
ning CMU. (Oh, come on, even I 
had to get one last jab in there 
before it becomes too late.)
My pick for the next president 
is, of course, Dwight Schultz. Who 
is Schultz, you may ask.
Well, Schultz is that lovable 
character actor who won the 
hearts of millions starring as the 
. nutty, gun crazy lieutenant 
“Howling Mad” Murdock in the 
now deceased TV series The A- 
Team.
Among the greatest of his as­
sets I would certainly include the 
fact that his ability to deal with 
the likes of Mr. T and George Pep- 
pard has prepared Schultz to 
handle the various corporate 
heads who often donate funds to 
the University.
Furthermore, I believe that 
having been a regular character 
in TheA-Team has not only freed 
Schultz from any acting jobs he 
may receive in the future, giving 
him ample time to run Carnegie 
Mellon, but has also prepared 
him to deliver any speech to any 
group of people without any con­
cern as to the quality or validity of 
the words.
In short, mark my words and 
remember the name of Schultz — 
he may be signing your financial 
aid checks any time soon.

Kissinger in running a drug 
smuggling ring out of the Social

ment.
Indeed, the effect of such a 
paranoid mind might spell doom 
for the Social and Decision Sci­
ences department, and we would 
not want that, would we?
Candidate number three was 
an interesting choice, but not one 
which I consider wise. After all,
Andrew Carnegie has been dead 
for over half a century.
While the concept of bringing 
old Andrew back from the dead to 
spearhead the school which he 
began makes him the sentimen­
tal favorite. I definitely think that 
having to have a seance every 
time some alumni group decides 
to invite the president of their 
alma mater to one of their lunch­
eons would be unreasonable.
Of course, there is one salient 
virtue to having Carnegie as our 
new president and that is of course 
his fund raising ability. I’m sure 
that I am not alone in declaring 
that if the undead body of Andrew 
Carnegie showed up at my bed­
side in the middle of the night, 
asking me for a donation I would 
not hesitate in giving him any 
sum of money he asked for.
If there is one message that I 
want the presidential selection 
committee to hear loud and dear 
it is that no, I do not want Pat 
Sajak as president of the Univer­
sity.
I don’t care if his new talk show 
has a refreshing wit to it which 
brings something fresh to the 
wasteland which is late night 
television. I don’t care if he brings

Dear Zazz:
At the end of a business lunch, 
is it proper for a woman to put 
on lipstick at the table?
I think women 
who do this are 
taken less seri­
ously by associ­
ates, male or 
female. I always 
excuse myself 
and freshen up in 
the restroom.
Well, a col­
league of mine 
argues that 
there’s nothing 
wrong with putting on lipstick. 
I hope you agree with me or else 
I’m lunchmeat.

While you shouldn’t attempt

lunch, there’s nothing wrong

Dear E.H.:

Over time, ferret took on the' 
meaning: “to drive out; expel.” 
A person was called a ferret if;

Dear Zazz:

CMU Computer Store
Academic Computing/Carnegie Mellon University 
January 27, 1989
The staff of the CMU Computer Store and PC Repair want to express our sincere thanks to those of 
you who answered our survey. We received a lot of helpful feedback and hope to use it to develop an 
improved image and improved services for our customers.
Our overall rating was slightly above average. We hope to do even better in the future. There are a 
few areas that we would like to address specifically:
1 )Pickup and Delivery
Several departments requested a pickup and delivery service for both the Store and 
Repair. This service already exists for departments. There is a minimal charge of $5.00 per 
system (or account number if there is no system being delivered) each way. Just call the Store 
or Repair to request this service. Unfortunately, we cannot offer this service off campus or to 
dormitory residents.
2)Extended Hours
We have had several.requests for extended hours. We attempted to satisfy these 
requests by offering extended hours of operation at the beginning and end of each semester. 
However, we have decided to institute a semester long plan. We will be open until 6:30 p.m. 
every Monday during spring semester beginning with February 13. If this program is well 
received, we will plan to offer Monday evening hours during the fall semester also.
3 JCustomer Service
We are very concerned that we did not receive an excellent rating in customer service. 
Apparently, our service has been uneven. We will be focusing on improving our level of 
courteousness and friendliness over the next semester and hope you will soon see us achieve 
our goal of excellence.
4 )Product Knowledge
Our staff, both Store and Repair, attempts to constantly stay aware of new products and 
the uses for these products. We attend product and maintenance training as often as is 
practical. It is our goal to be familiar with all the products the Store carries to the degree that 
we can make reasonable comparisons between products, configure systems appropriately and 
repair products quickly and accurately.
5)Pricing
We are pleased to see that those of you who responded felt our pricing was above 
average in most cases. Of course, we can be most competitive in products that we sell in 
volume.
Please let us know if you have any specific suggestions. We want to provide the services you need. 
Call us, send mail (campus or to ps00@andrew), or drop a note in our suggestion box. You may 
direct your comments to Dottie Walsh, Store Manager, or Jeff Wagner, Repair Manager, if you wish. 
We really appreciate your input.
A few of you offered to speak with us regarding your comments. You should receive a telephone call 
soon to follow up on your offer.
Again, thank you for your time. We will continue to strive for improvement. Your comments and 
suggestions help us to do that.

lusLb!Carnegie Mellon developing robot for Mars
uMrxr k2 Fc-EA 3WxWcwrd 
Robotic» researcher Red Whittaker scales scaffoWding to reach 
xMW elbow of an experimental robot arm.
By ERIKA L. PETERSON
Tartan Darkroom Manager
Giant steps are what you take
— walking on ... Mars. In the 
depths of Panther Hollow, housed 
in the renovated Bureau of Mines 
power plant, is Red Whittaker, 
head of a team of researchers de­
veloping an automated robot 
which will someday explore the 
surface of the Red Planet.
At forty, Whittaker is already a 
leading name in the robotics field. 
His robots cleaned up after the 
Three Mile Island nuclear disas­
ter, and he is currently involved 
in several other leading-edge 
robotics projects at CMU.
Whittaker’s team is a diverse 
cooperative group including 
graduate students and research­
ers from Computer Engineering, 
Computer Science, Electrical En­
gineering, Mechanical Engineer­
ing, and, of course Robotics. “This 
is really focused around the mis­
sion, technology, and equipment,” 
commented Whittaker about the 
team; “It’s not a personal mat­
ter.”
Whittaker emphasized the col­
laborative nature of the project, 
explaining that members of the
team participate in work outside 
of their narrowly-defined fields, 
thus encouraging a close-knit 
group.
Whittaker hopes to have a 
completed prototype built by the 
end of 1989. Once the unit has 
been built, the next two years will 
be spent developing the sensory 
and movement hardware and soft­
ware. The robot would then be 
ready to go to Mars.
The eventual product of the 
groups cooperation, at a total, 
relatively inexpensive, estimated 
cost of approximately $5 million, 
is a robot nicknamed AMBLER 
—Autonomous, Mobile, Explora­
tion Robot.
AMBLER will resemble a spi­
der with six legs rotating around 
a central core, each able to bend 
horizontally at the shoulder, ver­
tically at the elbow, and telescope 
for longer or shorter arm lengths. 
This mechanism will allow 
AMBLER to walk along the 
planet’s surface, balancing itself 
effectively on rough, slanted, or 
soft terrain.
The central core of the machine 
will house the computational 
equipment necessary for naviga­
tion, a small nuclear battery
supplying about one kilowatt of 
power — equal to the energy pro­
duced by 250 food calories per 
second — and various drills and 
probes for taking measurements 
of the planet’s soil, rocks, and 
other geological and mineralogi- 
cal assessments.
Because only a limited payload 
will be able to return from Mars 
to Earth, AMBLER will be 
equipped to make a number of 
scientific studies onboard. The 
unit itself will also remain on the 
surface of Mars.
With the help of AMBLER, 
space scientists hope to determine 
the mineralogical content of 
Martian soil, whether life is or 
was ever present on the planet, 
the amount of water present now 
and in the past, and the geologi­
cal factors which helped shape 
Martian geography and terrain.
This information will help sci­
entists gain a better understand­
ing of the forces which shaped our 
own planet. It will also aid scien­
tists involved in future Mars mis­
sions aimed at mining or coloni­
zation.
AMBLER could also have ter­
restrial uses including reconnais­
sance and agricultural missions
in areas with particuarly rough 
terrain or soft soil where wheeled 
vehicles are unusable. These types 
of areas constitute about a third 
of the Earth’s land.
Because of the distance from 
Earth to Mars, communication 
between humans and AMBLER 
would take approximately 30 
minutes, thus rendering remote 
operation of the robot impossible. 
AMBLER, then, must be almost 
completely self-sufficient, plotting 
its own course, checking the sta­
bility of the soil, predicting pos­
sible problems, and getting itself 
out of trouble situations.
AMBLER will make use of a 
system of lasers to take in visual 
information from its surrounding 
area. This information will then 
be translated into a set of maps 
showing not only distances, but 
also the texture of the surround­
ing terrain and obstacles.
This information would then by 
analyzed to determine the next 
movement. Because of the six 
legged structure, the movement 
of one leg would never jeopardize 
the stability of the entire unit, so 
steps could be retraced if the ter­
rain became unsafe or impass­
able.
SDC will sponsor “Challenge”
By MICHAEL SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Student Dorm Council (SDC) 
[will hold its first “Bigger and Bet­
ter” Challenge on February 18.
The “Bigger and Better” Chal­
lenge is a contest where each team 
will be given a paperclip and then 
¡sent out into the Pittsburgh area 
¡to trade their paperclip for some­
thing “Bigger and Better.”
The teams that return with the 
biggest, best and most unusual 
items win prizes.
To participate, each team will
need approximately 4-5 members. 
It is strongly suggested that the 
team have access to a car. (Please 
note: each car will be considered 
a separate team but you can have 
more than one team per floor or 
organization.)
The teams will also need a 
paperclip (provided by SDC). 
Floor teams and teams from 
campus organizations are wel­
come to participate.
The Challenge will start and 
end at the Morewood Rec Room 
on Saturday, February 18.
The teams will have between
and 5 pm to find the biggest, best, 
or most unusual deal they can. 
The winners will receive T-shirts 
as well as prizes being supplied 
by Domino’s Pizza.
To sign your team up for the 
“Bigger and Better” Challenge, 
call Amy Shali, the SDC Program­
ming Chair, at x4707 and leave a 
message.
Make sure to include your name, 
your extension, your floor or or­
ganization and the number of 
people on your team.
One more thing — don’t start 
talking ’til after the beep!

Meow! Cats comes to Heinz Hall
By STEPHANIE REEDY
Tartan Staffwriter
Andrew Lloyd Webber's award- 
winning feline musical Cain will 
return to Heinz Hall for its second 
showing in Pittsburgh on Febru­
ary 21. and will play until March 
5. If this is a show you want to see, 
and believe me, it is. be advised to 
buy your tickets now; the last pro­
duction ofCo/.s-that came to Pitts­
burgh sold out the 65.000 seats 
availiable in just two days.
Pittsburgh isn't the only city to 
so wi I lingly receive what has been 
called “the musical of the eight­
ies:" it was originally produced in 
London in 1981, and is still enjoy­
ing a great success at the New 
London Theatre. The show opened 
on Broadway at the Winter Gar­
den Theatre in 1982 to sold-out
crowds, and swept through the 
Tony Awards that year by taking- 
home seven of its own, including 
Best Musical. Cats continues to 
play to capacity crowds even now, 
seven years after its opening.
The show takes place on a stage 
that has been transformed into a 
cat’s paradise: a garbage dump 
with everything from cereal boxes 
to Coca-Cola bottles and rubber 
tires scaled to a cat’s eye view. The 
costumes (created by John Napier) 
and the movements of the dancers 
transform real people into illu- 
sionary cats. The lighting of the 
stage and the actors fulfill the illu­
sion by creating a fantasy world of 
light, sound, and movement that 
is not easily forgettable.
. Cats was created primarily by 
Andrew Lloyd Webber (composer, 
known also for Jesus Christ, Su­
perstar and The Phantom of the 
Opera), whose fondness as a child 
for T.S. Eliot’s poems from Old 
Possum’s Book of Practical Cats 
resulted in his creation of Cats’ 
score as an adult, using the words 
of the poems for lyrics. With the 
help of Valerie Eliot (wife of the 
late T.S., who brought Webber 
some unpublished material of her 
husband’s), along with the col­
laboration of director Trevor Nunn 
and associate producer/choreog­
rapher Gillian Lynne, Cats be­
came one of the most extravagant 
musicals of all time.
Tickets are availiable from $20 
- $37, and may be purchased at 
the Heinz Hall Box Office or any 
Kaufmann’s or Horne’s ticket 
outlet. To charge tickets by phone 
call TicketCharge at 392-4900.

Sloppy work from Woods and Downev...True Believer runs cold
By DRUE MILLER
Tartan Copy Manager
; Legal movies are a tough lot to 
review. Either they’re riveting, 
suspenseful dramas, and thus 
likened to Jagged Edge, or they’re 
dead-end stories full of last-min­
ute miracles, and thus contrasted 
to Jagged Edge. Either way, most 
of them lose out in box-office 
rbulette — most courtroom sce­
narios are either about boring
real-life subjects (civil suits, prod­
uct liability) or such horrific situ­
ations (mass murder, gang rape) 
that the audience rushes home to 
install extra locks on the doors 
and is unable to sleep for the next 
week. Add to that the prolifera­
tion of TV courtrooms (People’s 
Court, The Judge, Divorce Court, 
LA Law), and there’s no reason to 
leave the house at all.
True Believer is the latest ven­
ture into this glutted field —just
another log on the fires of Holly­
wood justice. It has the makings 
of a legitimate contender: a once- 
great lawyer reduced to getting 
drug dealers out of tight spots, a 
tight-lipped snarling bear of a DA 
(who, of course, doesn’t count the 
lawyer among his friends), and a 
young, street smart Korean, 
imprisoned eight years ago for a 
murder he didn’t commit. And all 
against the turbulent backdrop of 
NYC’s Lower East Side. Looks 
like a clear-cut case of the faulty 
American legal system riddled 
with racism, eh? An open-and- 
shut case that could solve itself, 
right?
Well, no. The prisoner’s mother 
visits Attorney Eddie Dodd 
(James Woods) in hopes of freeing 
her son from Sing-Sing, where of 
all things, he’s just killed a man. 
Out of self-defense, of course, a 
fellow prisoner and member of 
the notorious Aryan Front had it 
in for him and jumped him in the 
prison chapel. Dodd, however, 
decides to tackle the original 
charge — the murder of a gang 
member in Chinatown eight years 
ago—and reopens the case. Much 
to our dismay, though, Dodd 
spends most of his time following 
what seem to be tangential points 
and marginal leads. The miracles 
don’t happen until much, much 
later in the movie, and when they 
do, they’re just too unlikely for 
the audience to believe.
Coincidentally (or perhaps not), 
Dodd takes this case shortly after 
Roger Baron (Robert Downey, Jr.) 
shows up. Still wet behind the 
ears, Baron is just off the train 
from law school and wants to be 
Dodd’s assistant in his fight for 
truth, justice and (you know the 
rest). It takes Baron quite a while 
to realize the Dodd of his case 
books isn’t the one he’s clerking 
for now. Baron’s idolatry gives 
him a boost, but how much we’re

Irish rockers U2, seen here discussing the showing of their film, U2: Rattle and Hum, later this month 
at the Pittsburgh Playhouse.
Pgh. Playhouse shows Feb. films
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
This month the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse has another marvel­
ous lineup of films to offer the 
discriminating taste. They are 
providing a well-balanced combi­
nation of comedy and drama.
Showing February 8 is The 
Color Purple, Steven Spielberg’s 
masterpiece. Whoopi Goldberg 
stars in her Oscar nominated role 
as a poor black woman living in 
Georgia. The film also stars 
Margaret Avery, Danny Glover, 
and Oprah Winfrey, another 
Oscar nominee. This is an excel­
lent film — bring your tissues. 
Rated PG-13, the movie will be 
shown at 7:30 only.
A Fish Called Wanda will be 
shown on the 11th. Monty Py­
thon’s John Cleese hit it big in 
1988 with this hilarious comedy. 
He stars as a London barrister 
who unwittingly falls prey to 
thieves. Also starring are Jamie 
Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline, and 
. Michael Palin, who is also of
Monty Python fame. Don’t miss 
this one! Rated R, the film will be 
shown at 7:30, 9:30, and 11:30.
Valentine’s Day brings an ap­
propriate fairy tale/love story, The 
Princess Bride. Based on William 
Goldman’s novel and directed by 
Rob Reiner, the film boasts 
princes, monsters, swashbuckling 
heroes, and a cast that includes 
Mandy Patinkin and Christopher 
Guest. The movie is filled with 
more romance than comedy, but 
it’s worth seeing, even if only for 
Billy Crystal’s very funny cameo. 
Rated PG-13, the movie runs at 
7:30 and 9:30.
On February 16th the Play­
house will show Tampopo, a film 
about a Tokyo diner owner and 
her search for the perfect noodle 
recipe. Tampopo finds two men to 
help her, and they in turn recruit 
others. Also throughout the film 
are bits about food and how it 
affects people. According to all 
accounts, this is a marvelous, 
funny film. No rating, showing at 
7:30 and 9:40.
U2 : Rattle and Hum will be
shown on the 17th. This is the 
first concert film of the Irish rock- 
band, filmed on their 1987 tour- 
The movie combines songs with 
interviews of the band members.: 
Definitely a must see for die-hard: 
fans willing to sit through about, 
100 minutes of this stuff. If that’s, 
not for you, you might want to 
skip this one. Rated PG-13, show­
ing at 7:30, 9:30, and 11:30.
The 18th brings The Unbear­
able Lightness of Being. Directed 
by Philip Kaufman, starring 
Daniel Day-Lewis and Juliette, 
Binoche, the film is an adaptation 
of Milan Kundera’s novel. It deals - 
with the re-awakening of polite* 
cal and sexual freedom in Czecho; 
Slovakia in 1968. This is a won" 
derful film, and it sold out both 
shows in Doherty 2210 two weeks, 
ago. Take time out to see it. Rated. 
R, showing at special times: 7:00. 
and 10:00.
Any Marx Brothers fans out 
there? The Playhouse will pi’eS11 
ent a double bill on the 20th.

The terrible horror: “My daddy was a sperm bank”
A few weeks ago I was telling 
you about the Bodine sisters, 
Wanda and Doreen, and how they 
no longer marry the men they 
choose to bred with. They’ve had 
nine babies in the last ten 
years and all of em are 
named Bodine, except 
little Raul. We thought it 
would be cruel to name a 
Spanish baby Bodine, so 
he’s named Raul Bodino.
Bnt when I was writing 
about it, I thought this was 
a^NEW THING, invented by the 
Bodine sisters so they could treat 
men like old dirty dishrags, score 
some sperm from us, and then 
Hoist our hineys into the street 
before we know what we’ve 
hatched. All these women are 
PANICKED about their goldurn 
biological clock turning their fal­
lopian tubes into a pumpkin. 
''Anyhow, some friends of mine 
out in California have been send­
ing me these articles about the 
“lesbian baby boom.” Maybe 
you’re not familiar with the les­
bian baby boom. At first I thought 
it was true what we’ve thought all 
along: people in California came 
here from another planet, and all 
the people born there since World 
War II are space-alien science 
experiments that divide like 
amoebas. Either that or else all 
these lesbians have been having 
a lot of sex with one another and 
trying REAL hard.
But it turns out that the lezzies 
ate showing up at the sperm bank 
and saying “Gimme one of them 
test tubes with some of that icky 
stuff in it that MEN have.” And 
then they get em a lesbo sex part­
ner to frizz up her hair like Anne
Murray, and when the little frog- 
faced booger is born, he’ll never 
know the difference. They can 
name him something like “Jere­
miah” - nope, too sexist - how
about “Noah”?-nope, they’d laugh 
at him when he goes to Montes- 
sori School - I’ve got it! Jessie! 
Could be a boy. Could be a girl. 
The perfect name for the kid who’s 
gonna wake up one day and think 
“You know, there seem to be way 
too many sets of pantyhose around 
this house.”
This stuffis great, though. Soon 
as I heard about it, I ran over to 
Le Bodine to tell Wanda that all 
she needs is Artificial Spermati- 
zation. “You know,” I told her, 
“it’s like they do with race horses. 
You want Secretariat’s genes? The 
vet takes some of them Secretar­
iat genes, sticks em in a hypo, and 
then he makes sure they get to 
their destination. Eleven months 
later, Secretariat doesn’t know 
WHICH ONE belongs to him. It’s 
the exact same thing with hu­
mans, only you need to start you 
out on a strong lesbian relation­
ship in order to give the resulting 
Bodine child a strong and suppor­
tive environment.”
“I don’t need a lesbian,” she 
said, “I got Doreen around the 
house all day.”
“Doreen doesn’t count. Your own 
sister? That would be perverted!”
“Oh,” Wanda said.
Speaking of terrorist threats.

est Rambo III npoff of the year so

• J. Christian Ingvordsen, 
J who writes, produces, di- 
, rects, stars, and shoots off

natic about this stuff that 
every patch on the Russky 
uniforms has to be absolutely cor­
rect, and every shoulder-launched 
bazooka has to lurch the proper 
distance each time he blows the 
head off an Afghan rebel. Chris­
tian plays the same Oliver North- 
type guy he played in the movie 
Covert Action, only this time he 
has to sneak behind the Iron 
Curtain, machine-gun some Rus­
sians, survive KGB torture, es­
cape from a Gulag prison, become 
a hero to the Afghan freedom fight­
ers, save a beautiful French 
woman from the brutal Colonel 
Kochev, liberate a village full of 
Middle Eastern families that looks 
suspiciously like Mesa Verde, 
Colorado, survive the desert, win 
a snowmobile chase, kill some 
Russkies with an AK-47 assault 
rife, attack a Russian tank col­

diers with only two guys to help, 
make his way alone back to the 
United States, sneak onto the 
property of the director of the 
CIA, hold a gun at his head, and 
hitchhike home.

three important events by faculty 
and student ensembles. Cuarteto 
Latinoamericano plays the third 
in their series tonight, 
Opera/Music Theater 
Workshop presents scenes 
from Sondheim and Rogers
& Hammerstein on Satur­
day, and the Philharmonic 
and Concert Choir give a 
joint concert on Sunday.
All events are free and open to the 
public.
Brothers Saul, Aron and Alvaro 
Bitran and Javier Montiel make 
up the Cuarteto Latinoamericano, 
formed several years ago in Mex­
ico and now in residence at Car­
negie Mellon. Their free concert 
takes place in the auditorium of 
Mellon Institute (Bellefield en­
trance) at 8 pm tonight. On the 
program are two twentieth cen­
tury quartets, by Julian Orbon 
and Leonardo Balada (also on the 
faculty here), as well as the cele­
brated Beethoven Quartet Op. 132 
in A minor. The ensemble is 
known for its performances of
many of the new masterpieces of 
the twentieth century as well as 
for fresh, revelatory readings of 
more standard works. Their De­
cember concert was such a thrill-

not certain. Certainly, Dodd was 
quite capable of doing foolish 
things, like reopening a case on 
sketchy testimony and a gut feel­
ing, long before Baron showed up.
Eddie Dodd isn’t the sort of 
person you immediately sympa­
thize with; after all, he is “defend­
ing scum,” as so many in the movie 
are quick to point out. But Dodd 
isn’t the type for whom your 
sympathy grows, either. Blame it 
on Reagan and Bush: in these 
frying times of just saying “No” 
and Willie Horton horror stories, 
the same people who voted George 
and Dan into office can’t be ex­
pected to sympathize with a bona- 
fide Liberal, an attorney who not 
Qnlygeis drug dealers off the hook 
Gander the guise of protecting their 
civil liberties against government 
intrusion, while blatantly skirt­
ing the issues of possession and 
consumption) but furthers their 
careers by actually accepting 
drugs for personal usage. Mercy. 
Qood thing this movie didn’t come 
out last year — Dodd would have 
made a wonderful prop for the 
Bush campaign.
Sarcasm aside, Dodd’s charac­
ter really does fall flat on his 
sneering face much of the time. 
He seems to lack a sense of jus­
tice, at times appearing as though 
he really is in it only for his own 
gain. The few remembrances of 
his glory days are laughably 
unconvincing: so he protested in 
the 60s. So he made the headlines 
as a cut-throat champion of civil 
rights 20 years ago (cleverly illus­
trated by a few yellowed articles 
tacked up on the wall). Big deal. 
We can’t see any of that in him, 
and can’t avoid questioning 
whether it ever was there or not. 
All that remains of Eddie Dodd, 
(alleged) champion of the under­
dog, is a phony-looking pony tail 
and courtroom theatrics (As he 
iiddresses’ the jury, if you can call 
it that, Dodd is a dead-ringer for 
Morton Downey Jr.). His perform­
ance grabs its share of attention, 
but what we’re ultimately left with 
less a thought-provoking or 
spine-tingling thrill and more like 
toild indigestion.
Robert Downey, Jr.’s perform­
ance does little to arouse our 
sympathies either. But unlike 
^odd, Roger Baron does not leave 
|Us with the uncomfortable quea- 
|Siness of not knowing how we
• Simply, we don’t feel for him,
a fresh-faced L-school grad, 
straight out of the Midwest and 
looking more like Jimmy Olsen 
than a fan of Dodd’s. Downey’s 
portrayal is surprisingly insipid 
for a character so central to the 
plot.
Sadly, the most convincing 
characters are the odd-lot assort­
ment of criminals, convicts, and 
neo-Nazis. We don’t like them, 
but at the same time are relieved 
at finding characters we can pin 
down our feelings for. Collectively, 
they have more depth and real­
ism than any the main charac­
ters. Even Shu Kai Kim, the 
wrongly jailed man (played by 
Yuji Okumoto), doesn’t seem to 
care whether he gets out or not; 
not that he’s given up on his fate, 
because it seems as though he 
didn’t care much to begin with.
Besides weak characters, this 
movie is also peppered with inex­
plicable events. Somewhere
amidst the requisite chases and 
cover-ups of even more heinous 
crimes, Baron’s naivete disap­
pears. Poof, and it’s suddenly 
gone. We don’t know when or why 
this happens and don’t credit Dodd 
(or anyone else) for this transfor­
mation. Also, the initial. scene 
between Dodd and Kitty Greer 
(Margaret Colin), a private inves­
tigator whom he connives into 
helping out on the case, would 
lead us to believe they were once 
lovers, or want to be lovers, or will 
someday be lovers. But nothing 
ever happens with this potential 
sub-plot, which is a shame be­
cause Dodd could certainly use 
some emotional depth. The ten­
sion vanishes along with Baron’s 
innocence, and Kitty is reduced to 
being just another fixture in 
Dodd’s crusade. In fact, the rela­
tionship between them is strictly 
business from then on, without so 
much as a hint of a friendship.
Is there anything good to be 
found in True Believer? The mu­
sic is largely forgettable, a weak 
imitation ofBlood Simple's haunt­
ing piano score. The cinematog­
raphy has its moments, especially 
with an intriguing set of black & 
white flashbacks to the original 
crime. And, if you find Amster­
dam Avenue particularly appeal­
ing, you’ll see plenty of it as well. 
Some non-descript bars, a clut­
tered office, a chase through a 
plumbing supply house filled with 
ex-cons — most of the scenery is 
gritty, yet mundane. Realize, of 
course, thathaditbeen anyflash- 
ier, we might not have noticed the 
characters at all.
True Believer is a haphazard 
retelling of an interesting, al­
though overtold, tale. Surely the 
script deserved better.
True Believer, starring James 
Woods and Robert Downey, Jr., 
opens soon at a theatre near you.

Page, music director of the Choir, 
and will consist of two works. To 
open the half, Heidi Skok will be

Xala
' Senegalese filmmaker Ousmane Sembene’s vi­
cious satire of modern Africa was heavily censored in 
his native country. The hero of the film is a self- 
satisfied black businessman who is unexpectedly 
¿truck down by the xala, a curse that renders its 
victim impotent. His hilarious and pointed search for 
a cure speaks as a metaphor for the African depend­
ence on Western white technology and bureaucracy. 
This is one of the rare films that can effectively 
entertain and instruct simultaneously. In French 
with English subtitles.

Friday, February 10 Bull Durham
Understand one thing—baseball is not a sport. It 
is a religion. With that in mind, go see this movie. One 
of the funniest and best films of 1988, Bull Durham 
stars Kevin Costner as Crash Davis, a veteran minor- 
league catcher signed to the bottom-rung Durham, 
N.C. Bulls. His job is to put the polish on a major 
pitching talent with the common sense of an eight 
year-old (Tim Robbins). Add to this combination the 
presence of Annie (Susan Sarandon), an older but 
sexy ballpark (and ballplayer) groupie, and you have 
movie dynamite. This film is incredibly sexy and 
hysterically funny, and best of all it’s Baseball, with 
a capital ‘B.’ Best bet of the weekend, with one 
possible exception (see below.) Get there early.
At 6, 8, 10, 12 Rated R
Saturday, February 11 
Big Business
If one Lily Tomlin and one Bette Midler just aren’t 
enough for you, maybe you should seek therapy. 
Touchstone’s Big Business is the story of two sets of 
sisters, rich/poor and city/country, that were mixed 
up at birth (unbeknownst to all, natch.) Give the devil 
his due, these ladies carry this film all the way to the 
bank. The twin scenes are convincing and funny 
(although that shouldn’t surprise anybody; remem­
ber, these are the people who brought us The Parent 
Trap) and the rest of the film is bearable. It did well 
at the box office, but...eh. Go dancing instead.
At 6, 8, 10, 12 Rated PG

Casablanca
I said there might be an exception to the best bet 
of the weekend, didn’t I? We’re talking Bogie and 
Bergman and Claude Rains (Claude RAINS!!! Claude 
Rains is in this movie) and Sydney Greenstreet and 
Peter Lorre and “There’s a plane, and you’re getting 
on it,” and “Play it, Sam.” (Bogie never says “Play it 
again, Sam;” that’s a common misquote.) We’re talk­
ing about Rick’s Café Américain, for Heaven’s sake. 
We’re talking about “As Time Goes By;” what we have 
hère is a classic, extra-classic, double super-classic 
movie. I know — I know for a fact that there are some 
people who haven’t yet seen this film. Both of you, get 
with the program. Casablanca is one of the top ten 
films of all time.

Tartan Staffwriter
Now it’s a sad but true fact that 
a lot of people at CMU own a TV 
set but don’t have the time to 
watch it much. However, a lot of 
people on campus do own VCR’s 
and make the time to watch 
movies. This column will 
review new as well as old 
movies, each week, that are 
now available on video cas­
sette, in order to help you in 
selecting films. Your time, 
after all, is valuable.
The first movie up to bat is 
a regular CMU video 
tradition, Highlander. This 
great flick died a quick death 
in the theaters, but has been 
reincarnated though the wonder­
ful world of video.
The story centers around Con­
nor MacLeod (Christopher Lam­
bert), a pretty average guy except 
for the small fact that he is im­
mortal. Now life would be perfect 
for MacLeod except that he is not 
the only immortal running 
around; in point of fact there are 
several of these guys that have 
been running all over the world 
for the last few centuries. On top 
of that, there is one small glitch; 
they are not completely immor­
tal. If one of them gets his head 
lopped off, he will die. Eventu­
ally, when only a few immortals 
have their heads still attached, 
those few remaining will have an 
uncontrollable urge to attend the 
climactic “last gathering.” This is 
where the immortals engage in a 
duel to the death, for “there can 
be only one [immortal].” The last 
one alive will receive an incred­
ible gift of some sort and carry on 
with his life.
This movie explodes for almost 
two hours. The battles are waged 
with ancient broadswords that are 
sharp enough to cut titanium but 
end up hitting water pipes and 
electrical circuits more than 
people’s throats. Sean Connery 
plays Ramirez, a 2,437 year-old 
Egyptian who shows up in 16th-

century Scotland to train young 
MacLeod against the monstrous 
Kurgan (Clancy Brown). Kurgan 
is not the type of guy you bring 
home to visit your parents—he is 
the sort of person who snuffs out 
the candles in church and wears 
safety pins IN his neck.
Connery is only in the movie for
a brief period of time, which is a 
real shame, for his short appear­
ance brings dash and style to the 
film.
The movie continues as 
MacLeod meets Brenda (Roxanne 
Hart), a cop who just happens to 
be the author of A Metallurgical 
History of Ancient Sword Making 
and who, in turn, becomes very 
interested in MacLeod’s broad­
sword. The movie finally makes 
its way to the big fight scene be­
tween Kurgan and MacLeod. This 
fight scene is wonderfully done 
and is like watching a duel during 
the Fourth of July.
The movie does not have much 
humor, but my hat is off to the 
policeman who looks at a decapi­
tated corpse and asks his supe­
rior, “What do you think was the 
cause of death?” The music is 
excellent (performed by Queen) 
as is the photography. Go out and 
rent this movie; it is probably 
impossible to go through four 
years at CMU without watching 
it at least once.
The next movie that we have is 
a little-known but incredible film, 
House of Games. This movie was 
not released completely nation­
wide and as a result was shown in 
very few theaters.
The films stars Lindsay Crouse 
as Margaret Ford, a psychiatrist
who specializes in addictive be­
havior. One of her patients is a 
compulsive gambler who fears he 
will be killed over a bad debt. 
Ford becomes rather interested 
in this debt and decides to face 
the gambler who is terrorizing 
her client. She walks through 
smoky night streets until she 
reaches the House of Games, 
the gambling den. Here she 
confronts the gambler Mike 
(Joe Mantegna), and demands 
that her client’s marker be de­
stroyed. This is where the 
movie starts to get really ex­
citing.
Mike tells Ford that he has 
never heard anything like this 
before but will make her a 
deal. All she has to do is help 
him fleece a high-roller Texan in 
a big-stakes poker game. If she 
does this, he pledges to destroy 
the marker, so she cooperates. 
From this point on in the movie 
you can’t tell who is being conned
— Ford, Mike, or even you.
The plotting is diabolical and
impeccable, and I will not spoil.it 
by telling you any more of the 
story. This film is fascinating to 
watch as it takes you into the 
world of crooked gamblers, swin­
dlers and confidence men. Just 
sit back and watch the movie and 
get ready to hit the rewind but­
ton, for sometimes you might not 
believe what you just saw.
If you have seen other types, of 
con movies such as The Sting or 
The Hustler, let’s just say that 
this one blows them out of the 
water. The only movie that comes 
to mind that might be compa­
rable is Sleuth. I highly recom­
mend this movie and being fully 
wide awake and attentive while 
viewing it. By the way, House.of 
Games is available at the Infor­
mation Technology center in the 
basement of Hunt Library; you 
can’t take the film out of the cen­
ter, but you can bring a friend a^d 
watch it there. Hey, it’s free.

Playhouse shows films
grdx-dsWm .crn uAyW •T
Duck Soup. The first is about a 
missing painting; the second is a 
satire on war. Showing at 7:30 
only.
The Gods Must Be Crazy runs 
on the 22nd. A film about Bush­
men — not your idea of a good 
time? Well, guess how wrong you 
are. Gods is a very funny film that 
centers around a man traveling 
through South Africa who encoun­
ters the Bushmen. Directed by 
Jamie Uys and rated PG, Gods 
will be shown at 7:30 and 9:30.
Can’t get enough of Monty Py­
thon this month? See Life of Brian 
on the 24th. Starring the whole 
Python clan, the film centers 
around a man whose life parallels 
that of Jesus Christ’s. In my opin­
ion, this is the funniest of the 
Python films. Brian was directed 
by Terry Jones. Rated R, at 7:30, 
9:30, and 11:30.
Imagine: John Lennon will be 
shown on the 25th. The documen­
tary is narrated by John Lennoii 
and provides footage of John and 
Yoko. Also included are clips of 
unpublished music. Rated R, the 
film will run at 7:30, 9:30, and 
11:30.
In a marvelous way to wrap up 
the month, the Playhouse will 
show the Oscar winnning Best 
Film of 1984, Amadeus, on the 
28th. F. Murray Abraham, who 
won the Best Actor Oscar, stars 
as Sallieri, the composer who 
admires and at the same time 
resents the genius of Mozart. Tom 
Hulce, also nominated for Best 
Actor, portrays Mozart brilliantly. 
Rated PG, Amadeus will be shown 
at 7:30 only.
Admission at the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse is $3.00. It is located at

logic is no object...

By DAN BIDWA
Tartan Staffwriter
Now that February is here and 
•' Showing January just how winter 
is supposed to act, it’s time 
"to honor the New Year by 
jumping to a few conclusions.
(Like this introduction, for 
example.) Remember, logic 
•is-no object.
Rod Stewart has purged 
himself of any rock-and-roll- 
¦ hèss that he used to possess 
back in his Small Faces days, 
and he’s proven it with his new 
cover of The Who’s “Pinball Wiz­
ard.” Elton John wishes that he 
^ad the technology to make a cover 
this sappy. Really, this retro-re- 
tread-remaking has gone much 
too far, and has to stop soon, or 
there will be gunplay and I won’t 
be held responsible. (Actually, 
1 fhat’s not such a bad idea, just as 
long as the battle takes Tiffany 
and Kylie McNougat too.)
In the never-ending vigil 
against Beatles defamation, Mi­
chael Jackson has taken bold 
Strides against the enemy by forc­
ing SST to recall Das Damen’s 
Marshmallow Conspiracy EP. It
appears that “A Song For Michael 
Jackson To Sing” was not appre­
ciated by the Great Gloved One, 
or his lawyers. Anyway, this is 
how collector items are created,
Music nCt0F nCt0F 
ad 
gWs0Wr
so grab it while you can. (The 
same thing happened a while ago 
with the JAMMS and Abba’s 
lawyers, and the LP is really 
expensive now.)
The Danzig show last Wednes­
day was reportedly a hot affair, 
although still not worth the $14.00 
it cost at the door.
Incidently, if you picked up the 
reissue of the Misfits’ classic Walk 
Among Us LP and wondered what 
all the fuss was about, there’s a 
reason. It seems that, in this digi­
tal age, those in charge decided 
that the original version of the 
album wasn’t clear enough, so 
they mucked about with the voice
and the drums and all the rest. I 
guess they figured out a way to 
mix out most of the energy as 
well, because it’s pretty dry stuff. 
Luckily, the reissue of the Misfits’ 
Die Die My Darling EP seems 
to be un-messed-with. Pick it 
up first, and find out why the 
Misfits got so huge (besides 
the popularity of their skull 
graphic).
Upcoming stuff: Sacred 
Reich is going to be at the 
Banana Thursday. They do a 
cover of Black Sabbath’s “War 
Pigs” on their latest Surf Nicara­
gua EP, and it’s a surprisingly 
descriptive choice.
DJ Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince 
will be at the A. J. Palumbo Cen­
ter next Saturday, along with 
Tone Loc. I don’t know much about 
rap, but I like Jazzy Jeff, who 
flows a bit more cleverly than 
most. Tone Loc is well-known for 
his version of “Wild Thing.” I don’t 
talk about anyone who covers 
“Wild Thing.”
Far-Off-And-Upcoming stuff: 
Wolfgang Press at Metropol, and 
Eek-A-Mouse at Graffiti. Stay 
tuned.
Special
Interest
Houses
The Housing Office is now accepting applications from groups of students 
who would like to be considered for residency in one of the Four Special Interest 
Houses.
Each Special Interest House is a 4-bedroom, 8-person apartment in the 
Margaret Morrison residence complex. In order to be eligible for consideration as 
a Special Interest House, a student group must have at least eight members, and 
one or two alternates if at all possible.
The specific goal of the Housing Office in providing the Special Interest 
Houses is to encourage situations where the living environment compliments the 
learning opportunities of the residents involved and where specific educational 
goals outlined by the member-residents are understood and enhanced.
If more than four groups of students submit applications for these Special 
Interest Houses, a decision will be based on comparison of the educational goals 
presented and the liklihood of serious educational benefit being derived from 
residency in this type of living situation.
Application forms are available in the Housing Office and must be filled out 
and returned by February 14, 1989.
Forbes features sound & fury
By JULIETTE BORDA
Special to the Tartan
A show of sculptures and 
drawings by Robin Gar­
ber and Troy Lambert 
will open tomorrow at the 
Forbes Gallery.
Both seniors’ works 
deal with themes of the 
body as a container and 
life cycles. Robin is par­
ticularly interested in 
what happens after a life 
cycle on earth is completed—is 
a life’s replacement something 
tangible (the idea of reincarna­
tion), or could it be something 
as intangible as light or sound? 
Robin speculates the latter, with 
sculptures that employ sound 
and different applications of 
light. She has experimented
with neon and fiber optics, and 
will present an installation of 
forty-two candle-like pieces which 
are illuminated with light bulbs.
Troy is interested in ritualistic 
subject matter as well—his sculp­
tures and drawings, however, are 
not primarily concerned with 
what happens after life. Rather, 
his work expresses how the 
human form can be viewed as a 
container. Vessels play a large 
role in his work; they can be par­
alleled in meaning with the body 
as a container, even though the 
body and vessel are completely 
different forms.
Troy layers plastics, 
wax, and fiber with a 
chicken wire frame to 
create his sculptures.; 
Robin will show sculp­
tures in cast as well as 
blown glass; she will 
also show objects which 
have been “reincar­
nated” in the gallery 
setting.
Robin and Troy will host a 
closing reception on Saturday 
night from 7-9 pm at the Forbes 
Gallery, 5200 Forbes Ave. All 
are welcome to attend.
Juliette Borda is the publicity 
director of the Forbes Gallery.

PtAn-O2 A..A-c' xAEWw rd 
dW: nWAd-dy -d Cousins
By MICHAEL SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
Cousins is a hilarious new 
romantic comedy from Paramount 
Pictures Corporation starring Ted 
Danson and Isabella Rossellini. 
In this film, CMU alumnus Dan­
son and Blue Velvet's Rossellini 
create a cinematic magic that is 
all their own.
Danson is Larry Kozinski, a 
ballroom dance instructor. He has 
a beautiful wife, Tish, and a teen­
age son from a previous marriage, 
Mitch. Larry and Tish are con­
tent with life with each other, but 
they really aren’t that happy.
Rossellini is Maria Hardy. Her 
husband, Tom, is an unfaithful 
low-life who’s been sleeping with 
half the women in town. We learn 
to truly despise this man before 
the picture is through. She has a 
six-year-old daughter, Chloe.
The movie begins with the 
wedding of Larry’s uncle Phil to 
Maria’s mother, Edie. Cousins 
now by marriage, Larry and Maria 
finally meet after the wedding 
reception. All of the other guests 
have gone and Tish and Tom are 
nowhere to be found. The cousins 
talk and become instant friends. 
Larry is a dance instructor who 
loves children. Maria is a legal 
secretary who loves her little girl. 
They both believe that Tom and 
Tish are having an affair (seems 
only natural).
Together, Maria and Larry will 
develop a beautiful friendship that 
truly endears them to the audi- 
énce. They fall head over heels in 
love with one another, but refuse 
to become anything more than 
friends. Neither is really very am­
bitious when it comes to careers 
or money, but both love a beauti­
ful day, children, and pleasing 
other people.
It doesn’t take long for Tish and 
Tom to become jealous, certain 
' that Larry and Maria are having 
an affair. Maria convinces Tish 
that is isn’t true, but Tom is still 
insanely jealous.
The wedding business is in full 
swing as Larry and Tom come to 
grips at the reception of some 
other cousins. Tom falls face first 
into the wedding cake and knocks
himself unconscious. It is then 
that Maria decides that it would 
be best for all concerned if she and 
Larry ended their friendship — 
too many people were getting hurt.
Months pass quickly as we see 
Maria with the Christmas tur­
key, Larry walking along the 
streets gazing into decorated win­
dows, Maria putting the Christ­
mas decorations back into their 
boxes. As we watch the detached 
pair, it easy to see that they miss 
one another.
By this time, Tish has moved 
out. Tough luck, Larry. Tish goes 
on to advance her career and Larry 
is left to think about Maria.
Near the end of the movie; 
another wedding. Uncle Phil has 
passed on and Maria’s mother, 
Edie, has been wooed by Larry’s 
dad. Larry and Maria are both at 
the wedding as well as Tish and 
Tom. Tish says her good-byes and 
wishes Larry good luck, then 
Larry goes to talk to Maria. Will 
they ever get together? Think 
happy ending, movie-goers.
Cousins was inspired by the 
1975 hit French film Cousin, Cous- 
ine. It was written and directed 
by Jean-Charles Tacchella and is 
one of the highest grossing for­
eign films of all-time as well as an 
Academy Award nominee.
Unlike many other love stories, 
Cousins portrays the effects that 
Larry and Maria’s newfound love 
has on their families. In reality, 
when people fall in love, they touch 
the lives of many, not just one 
another.
The characters in Cousins were 
created by Stephen Metcalfe, who 
wrote the American adaptation. 
He wanted them to display the 
perspective of contemporary 
America. Even the extras for this 
film were cast carefully, as we see 
them over and over again at the 
many weddings in the film.
Cousins is a movie I can recom­
mend — it’s heartwarming and 
touching; easily worth the price 
of admission.
Cousins is scheduled to open in 
Pittsburgh on Friday, February 
10, just in time for St. Valentine's 
Day. Check local listings for times 
and venues.

PITTSBURGH — City Theatre 
is currently presenting the East 
Coast premiere of Steven Dietz’s 
unique rock “concertplay,” Paint­
ing it Red, the third offering of the 
1988-89 season. Dietz directs the 
production, which opened on 
January 25 and runs through Feb­
ruary 19.
Painting it Red is an unusual 
combination of live rock concert, 
sophisticated romantic comedy, 
and searing, insightful commen­
tary on the state of modern rela­
tionships. The electric rhythms 
of an onstage rock band serve to 
punctuate the story of Liz who, 
after the breakup of a three-year 
romance, finds herself suddenly 
and unwillingly thrust into the 
painful and confusing singles 
scenes of the’80s. The play weaves 
back and forth between hard-driv­
ing rock songs and the offbeat 
characters that populate Liz’s life 
as she works through the process 
of healing her broken heart.
Steven Dietz has worked as a 
playwright and director in Min­
neapolis for eightyears. His plays 
God’s Country, Ten November, 
Foolin' Around With Infinity, 
More Fun Than Bowling, Burn­
ing Desire, Wanderlust, and 
Random Acts. He directed the 
world premiere of Kevin Kling’s

In a program entitled “You Must 
Change Your Life,” German ac­
tress Dietlinde Turban Maazel 
will be reading a selection of poems 
by Rainer Maria Rilke. Ms. 
Maazel will be accompanied by 
the Mendelssohn Chamber Cho­
rus conducted by Robert Page.
Rilke is regarded by many as 
one of the most important mod­
ern poets because of his precise, 
lyrical style and his use of sym­
bolic imagery and spiritual re­
flections. His works provided the 
inspiration for the critically ac­
claimed film Wings of Desire, 
which was released last year and 
appeared at the Pittsburgh Play­
house last October [uWings of 
angels on the streets of Berlin,” 
10/4/88]. He characterizes death 
as a transformation of life into an 
invisible reality. To him, life and
death form a unified whole which 
he praises as a cosmic experience.
The reading will take place on 
February 8 at 8:00 pm in the 
Carnegie Lecture Hall. Admission 
is $5.00 for students and $9.00 for 
adults. Tickets are available at 
TIX locations and at the Interna­
tional Poetry Forum’s office, lo­
cated in Webster Hall, Oakland. 
Visa, Mastercard, and 
Kaufmann’s charges are accepted 
at 621-9893.

Drummer Peter Erskine and 
saxophonist Brandon Fields have 
each released new records dem­
onstrating different sides of jazz.
Erskine’s Motion Poet is the 
better of the two. Erskine and his 
many guest artists stay within 
the limits of traditional jazz, play­
ing arrangements mostly for large 
groups and soloists.
The album features songs by 
six different writers, but the ones 
that work the best, “Erskoman” 
and “Not a Word,” are both Er 
skine originals. On those tracks, 
the talents of his guest soloists 
are used extremely well.
Fields’ album The Traveler 
takes the opposite approach. It is 
dedicated to showcasing Fields’' I 
increasing talents on saxophone; 
While his sound is indeed good; 
his choice of music leaves some-' 
thing to be desired. Fields’ style1 
lies somewhere between Branford.1; 
Marsalis and David Sanborn.
Listening to Fields is very easy 
to do. He does not challenge the 
listener to keep up with his play-!; 
ing nor does he attempt anything! 
out of his range.
All in all, both are good jazz 
albums. Neither are must havesjl 
or even must tapes, for your col-jl 
lections, but they will provide soli™
21A for Quicksilver Stage — a 
theatre he co-founded in Minnea­
polis. He also directed the pre­
miere productions of Jon Klein’s 
TBone n'Weasel and John Olive’s 
Voice of the Prairie. His most 
recent writing includes Happen­
stance, which he directed at the 
Guthrie Lab in Minneapolis. 
Dietz’s writings about the the­
atre have appeared in American 
Theatre Magazine, Callboard, 
and the Los Angeles Times.
Painting it Red is the result of a 
collaboration between Dietz and 
members of the Twin Cities rock 
group Rue Nouveau. Dietz wrote 
the script, composer Gary Rue 
wrote the music and singer/lyri­
cist/actress Leslie Ball wrote the 
lyrics and played the central role 
of Liz. The play was given work­
shop production at the Actors 
Theatre of St. Paul, after which it 
was produced in full at Quicksil­
ver Stage Company and Berkeley 
Repertory Theater. In City The­
atre’s production Leslie Ball will 
reprise her critically acclaimed 
role of Liz.
Curtain time for Painting it Red 
is 8 pm Wednesday, Thursday 
and Friday, 6 and 9 pm Saturday, 
and a 2 pm matinee on Sunday.
