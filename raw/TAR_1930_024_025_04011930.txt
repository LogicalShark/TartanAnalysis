DELTA UPSILON IS 
VICTOR IN ANNUAL 
FRAT-DORM SWIM
Forbes Street House Wins 
Second Leg on the 
Silver Trophy
Collins Is High Scorer
Kountz of Phi Psi Lowers 
Meet Record in the 
Breast Stroke
Carnegie’s museum of fine water 
constituted the grounds for the sixth 
annual Inter-Mural liquid battle 
which decided the possession of the 
swimming cup. Delta Upsilon fra­
ternity paid the yearly rent in the 
form-of a keenly contested victory 
over the various teams on the cam­
pus. . This gives them two legs on 
the cup with a promise of permanent 
possession when winning the third. 
This year’s meet showed a decided 
improvement over those of previous 
years. The races were fast and close, 
and more than a dozen teams were 
entered. The shouts of about 200 
people added to the air of excite­
ment.
Second placc was taken by Kappa 
Sigma, and third by Delta Tau Delta. 
Collins was high point scorer with 
firsts in the 25-yard and 100-yard 
free styles, and lie assisted the 
D U’s in winning the relay. Kountz, 
of Phi Kappa Psi, succeeded in 
lowering the intra-mural record for 
the fOO-yard breast stroke by eleven 
seconds. The D U’s took four firsts, 
while the Kappa Sig’s .took half as 
many.
Under Head Judge Moses, the vars­
ity swimmers acted as time keepers. 
Coached Riscdorph manned the guns, 
while Manager Butz tiok care of 
the clerical end. It can be said that 
the following scores arc directly 
propoiiional to the time and efforts 
that each fraternity put forth on this 
sport. So for next year lie prepared. 
Delta Upsilon, 30^1; Kappa Sigma, 
24; Delta Tau Delta, 9; Delta Phi 
Delta, 5/; Phi Kappa Psi, 5, and 
others also swam.
Aviation Club Open 
Meeting to Feature 
Government Movies
Next Wednesday, April 2, the 
Aviation Club- will hold an open 
meeting, featured by movies and 
interesting talks. As in the past 
there will be government reels on 
topics allied with aviation.
A portion of the evening has. 
been reserved for open discussion 
on the papers given at the Pitts­
burgh Aeronautics meeting recentlj'-. 
A limited number of copies of 
these papers will be available at 
the meeting from George Land- 
graf.
Saturday, March 22, an inspec­
tion trip sponsored by the Avia­
tion Club was made to the Fokker 
Aircraft Company at Glendale, W- 
Va. The entire sophomore class in 
Aeronautical Engineering made the 
trip by bus, leaving at 7 in the 
morning and returning late in the 
afternoon.
Other inspection trips in the 
near future will be to the Good­
year Zeppelin hangar at Akron, O., 
on April 22, and an overnight trip 
to the various airplane factories at 
Buffalo later in the spring. Plans 
for the trip to Akron are for the 
Junior Aeronautical Engineers and 
any others interested to make the 
journey by bus at a round-trip fare 
of about $5. .
Puppet Staff Issues 
Three More Numbers
The Puppet staff is planning to 
put out three more issues of the 
magazine before the end of the 
school year. A Spring issue, a 
Track issue, and a Commencement 
issue will be edited in the order 
named.
The last two issues of the Pup­
pet represent the work of next 
year’s staff. Although the work 
was somew’hat supervised by the 
old staff, the new' writers were 
given an opportunity to gain ex­
perience which is sure to prove 
valuable later. They were able, too, 
to show' what they could do.
The Alumni number of the Pup­
pet is out now and shows well for 
the .work of the new: staff,
'‘Resolved, That Art School Girls 
Are Cattier Than Maggie Murphs
“Resolved, that the Art School 
Girls are Cattier Than. Maggie 
Murphs,” is the title of the debate 
to be held c^-officio by the M. 
M. Debating Club. Contrary to 
tradition, there will be no set time 
or placc for the debate, nor will it 
be limited to two speakers. Lit­
erally, this debate will never take 
place—in fact, it never was pro­
posed by the organization 'with 
w'hich it is here affiliated—but then 
this is All Fools’ Day and the dis­
pute is wholly in keeping. The 
fight, begun ’wray back in medieval 
times, has never come to a definite 
head, but it will probably continue 
smouldering till the bitter end. 
One architect settled it by declar­
ing that "there is no cattiest group 
on campus—they all come under 
that category—all the superlatives
automatically reducing themselves 
to absolute zero, which is. all the 
whole sex amounts to anyway.” 
Mud-slinging aside, we consider 
the proposed points of debate by 
the affirmative; Jennie Plumpdoodle 
and Ada Corn represent the semi­
nary for affiliated females across 
the street from Arts. These two, 
representating women’s high pre­
rogatives, affirmatively declare that 
"Arts girls are cattier than Mag­
gie Murphs.” Both Miss Plump­
doodle and her Corn-y colleague 
talk together, but we were able 
to ascertain bits of argument from 
their dialogue concerto:
. "Arts school is co-education 
(stated Miss Plumpdoodle primly) 
and is it any wonder the girls arc 
so cajty? The mere presence of a

Exhibit Of Paintings For Public Schools Now At Institute
Pictures Donated By One 
Hundred Friends of 
Pittsburgh Art
A group of paintings, given to 
the public schools by the One Hun­
dred Friends of Pittsburgh Art, is 
being exhibited at the Carnegie In­
stitute. The exhibition opened 
March 18 and will continue through 
June 1. The collection is said to be 
the finest owned by aii3r public 
school system in the United States.
The One Hundred Friends of 
Pittsburgh Art was organized in 
1916 to establish an annual fund 
of $1,000 to be used for the pur­
chase of paintings from the annual 
exhibition of the Associated Artists 
of Pittsburgh.
Each year the paintings pur­
chased by the One Hundred Friends 
arc show'll at exhibitions in the 
public schools of the city. There 
are now 63 paintings by 45 local 
artists. Artists represented in the 
One Hundred Friends of Pittsburgh

Change of Address
Alumni and Night students are 
kindly requested to report any 
change of address to the Cir­
culation Manager of the Tartan.
Traffic Light Will 
Be Erected At Cut
As a result of agitation by the 
school and students, a traffic light 
will be installed by the city at the 
entrance to the Cut on Forbes 
and MoreAvood.
Mr. Orbin, of the Purchasing De­
partment for the school, received 
notice of this fact in a letter writ­
ten March 19 by Burton Alarsh, 
City Traffic Engineer. In this let­
ter, Mr. Marsh stated that the city 
expects to advertise within the next 
two weeks for bids on a contract 
which will include the signalizing 
of this intersection.
Men’s Glee Club Will

The Men’s Glee Club and Band 
will present a program in the audi­
torium of the South Hills High 
school under the auspices of Troop 
213 of the Boy Scouts of America, 
Friday evening, April 4. All the

ing to make the conccrt a financial 
success.
The program will include a chalk 
talk by Bill McDcrmott, a piano 
accordion solo by Alan Bcvcrstock,

Mid-Year Rushing Of New Freshmen 
Now In Progress
Rushing Regulations to 
Strictly Enforced At 
This Time
Be
Second Semester Rushing season 
began last Saturday morning at 
10:30. All rules and regulations of 
the game of rushing must be strict­
ly observed. Fines will be im­
posed on misbehaving fraternities 
as has been done in the past wdicn 
some of the rules have been dis­
obeyed. Second semester rushing 
regulations state that, the season 
shall last for two weeks from 10:30 
Saturday morning, March 29, until 
1 o’clock Sunday morning, April 
13, after which there- will be a 
brief period of utter silence until
10 o’clock when the rushces arc 
permitted to return of their own 
volition to the fraternities to which 
they wish to pledge themselves. 
These laws governing rushing w'crc 
adopted for second semester rush­
ing season at the last meeting of 
the Intcr-Fratcrriity Council.
At ‘the last meeting of the Intcr- 
Frate'rnity Council, plans wrcre pre­
sented for the formation of a new 
council, but no definite action was 
taken because the presentation for 
reorganization must first be dis­
cussed by the members of the var­
ious fraternities on the campus in 
their different meetings so as to 
obtain the opinions of the fra­
ternity men on the plan. Accord­
ing to the proposal, the Inter- 
Fraternity Counoil will consist of 
the presidents of all the fraternities 
wrho will hold their meeting every 
other week at one of the Greek 
Domiciles, instead of the weekly 
meeting held Saturday mornings in 
the "Y” office. This method of 
,meeting will be somewdiat like that 
used by the honorary fraternities 
at the present, except that when the 
council has a meeting, it will start 
w'ith dinner.
Jessie Stephen 
British Labor Leader 
Will Speak Today
"You sec our Scots girls arc par­
ticularly strong for getting the full 
w'orth of their pence and pound.” 
With a twinkle in her eye the big 
boned Scotswoman thus explained her 
entrance into the labor movement 
w'ith her organization of the first 
domestic workers’ union in Great 
Britain. ITersclf a domestic w’orker 
from the time she left school at an 
early age, Jessie Stephen drew from 
long hours and grinding toil the les­
son that onl}r by co-operation and 
united action could the “humble and 
toiling” gain some measure of jus­
tice and the good life. A member 
o' the Socialist Party at the age of 
sixteen, a trade union officer at 
seventeen, Miss Stephen has been 
continuously active in the labor 
movement from the time of its most 
modest beginnings until today when 
it rules by consent the British Com­
monwealth.
Miss Stephen, who is a member 
of the London County Council, is 
rather reluctant to talk about herself. 
She has been so completely identi­
fied with the labor movement that 
therein lies the center of her intcr-

Carola Goya Takes 
Cornelia Skinners 
Place Tonight
Miss Skinner Very III
Famous Spanish Dancer Se­
cured At Last 
Moment
Owing to a sudden indisposition 
on the part of Cornelia Otis Skin­
ner, who w'as to be the presenta­
tion .of the Women's Scholastic Or­
ganization this evening in Carnegie 
Music Hall, her engagement -has 
been cancelled and Carola Goya, 
famous Spanish danccr has been sCf- 
cured as a substitute.
Miss Goya offers a program o'f 
Spanish danccs in all their native 
beauty. Each of her numbers cx- 
ccpt certain ones of her own crea­
tion to the music of modern Span­
ish composers, is a classical flam­
enca, or folk dance, whose steps 
and rhythm have been familiar in 
Spain for generations. In costume, 
in form and in mood,- Miss Goya’s 
danccs reflect the life, the tradi­
tions and the art of the Iberian 
Peninsula. She has been having ^ 
remarkable success in London! 
New Y'ork and other cities. ' Í
Each Spanish province and cit>» 
has danccs entirely its ow?n, and 
those on Miss Goya’s programs 
are peculiarly characteristic of the, 
section to which they arc native— 
the wild Jota of Aragon, the whirl­
ing and playful Asturiana of As-; 
turia, the stately Fandanguillo ~ oY 
Malaga, the courtly Espania Mia 
of Castile, and various fiery and 
langorous danccs of Andalucía, such 
as the Bulerias-Del Rocia, the 
Alcgrias-Solca, the Tango Trianera, 
the Tango Giralda, the Farruca 
Divina, Del Sacro Monte, De La 
Vega Granadina and Andalucía 
Gitana.
The Andalucian danccs are strict­
ly of the gypsy and Flamenca 
types—danccs which may be said 
to have sprung from the hot, ro­
mantic soil and radiant, moonlight 
of Southern Spain.

Mr. Harte Cooke To Lecture On “Diesel Engines” In Union
Diesel Type of Oil Burning 
Engine Being Adapted 
For Aircraft
“Diesel Engines” will be the gen­
eral subject of Hartc Cooke’s pub­
lic. lectures to he ¦ delivered in! thp. 
Union, 8:30 p. m. on Wednesday, 
April .2, and Thursday, April 3. 
Under this general title lie will 
discuss on Wednesday "The Diesel 
Engine and Its Use for Central 
Stations and Industrial Power,” and 
on Thursday, "The Diesel Engine 
for Use in Transportation in Ma­
rine Service and on the Railways" 
will be discussed.
Mr. Cooke is a Mechanical En­
gineer for McIntosh and Seymour 
Corporation, Auburn, N. Y*» He 
has w'orked with this corporation 
since 1892 in the development first,- 
of steam engines and, since 1913 
of, Diesel engines. He is a mem­
ber of the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers,, the Society 
of Naval Architects and Marine 
Engineers, and the Society of Auto­
motive Engineers.
Diesel engines arc the most econ­
omical type of engine for aircraft 
but as yet arc only in the experi­
mental stage in that field because 
of their great, weight. They are 
becoming more and more prominent 
in transportation, especially in ma­
rine and in oil-electric engines for 
railwa}rs. This fact together with 
the fact that Mr. Cooke has been 
engaged in the development and 
building of them for some jrears 
should increase the interest • in 
these l’cctures. No cards of ad­
mission are required; cvcrjronc is 
invited.

Forbes Hall, arranged the dinner 
and will act as hostess.
The drive for subscriptions for

Envious Maggie Murphs Onlookers 
As Dramats Develop Temperament
Room 150, Arts, harbored three 
pianos, a tom-tom, and several 
premature wrestling contests. The 
piano and the tom-tom were still, 
but an embryo repetition >pf the 
Dempsey-Carpentier encounter wras 
being enacted in the middle of the 
room. On the sides of. the arena

suits . . . And although the set­
ting may sound like the musical 
comedy. interpretation of “Kid 
Boots,” in reality it was the as­

ing up for their Eurythmics class 
This sort of thing, almost unknown 
to the Maggie Murphs across the 
way or to the Engineers down the 
alley, “is a pre-requisite for a dra­
matic career. “It,” asserts Miss 
Doris Portman, the instructor, “is 
excellent training in developing
poise of body and rhythm of move­
ment." Her brisk "Open the win­
dows, children,” congregated them 
in the ccnter of the long room, 
and the class officially began.
To the accompaniment of "piano 
forte,” they promenaded around the 
room, single file, doing all manner 
of variations of tlie walking pace, 
from the Prussian Goose Step to 
their version—“Tiptoe On The 
Floor Boards!” with laudatory 
gusto antt abandon. The music 
took on a livelier swing and they 
sub-divided each beat into Wo and 
three steps, skipping down the 
floor in perfect rhythm—or, in 
some cases, lumbering along, at a 
break-neck thudding pace. Now

Coming Fight
As a result of the recent elections 
in Margaret Morrison Carnegie . Col- 
¦fcgr;—the new' PrcstdciTT'ff^tlTc'~M'ar- 
garct Morrison Senate is Martha Lou 
Clark, ’31. The Vicc-Prcsidcnt and 
Secretary clcctcd at the same time are 
Grace Borgcrding, ’31, and Jane

ber of the Household Economics De­
partment, .while the other two officers 
are students in Secretarial Studies 
and Social Work, respectively.
The rcccnt nominations for Presi­

greatest number of nominees exists 
in the School of Engineering, where 
L. M. Baugh, Frank Mueller, Mar­
vin Fox, A. C. Redding an.i I-I. R. 
Wcitzcl were named. In the school of 
Industries, P. R. Magnuson and B.
G. Zcihcr have been nominated, Leo 
Daschbach, Lathr.m .Flanagan, Willi­
bald Ryshanek, and Ii. Allen Todd 
arc the nominees in Arts School.

membered by many students this 
syncopating master of music sup­
plied the tunes for a number of 
•the football danccs in the Union 
last fall, and the airplane show a' 
Motor Square Garden last month. 
If the plans of the dance com­
mittee, composed of Benny,. Auld, 
Henry Bunker, Robert R. Gal-

James Ashwell Appointed 
General Chairman of 
Carnival
The Carnegie Spring Carnival ,j>lan 
passed by the Student Council, has 
been approved by the Executive 
•Board and the officers and commit­
tee heads arc now working on the 
details of the program. After the 
general plan wras approved by the 
Student Council a student vote w-as 
taken in which 1435 day students, 
well oyer half of the enrollment, 
pledged, to support the idea. With 
this promise of a substantial backing 
for the projcct the Committee on 
Student Activities presented the plan 
with their approval for the considera^ 
tion and final stamp of approval of 
the Executive Board.
The Executive Board, on the 
recommendation of the Committee on 
Student Activities, voted that the 
petition of the Student Council for a 
Spring Carnival be granted. This 
action permits the Council to hold 
a two-day Spring Carnival on Fri­
day and Saturday, May 9 and 10, 
on the understanding that plans con­
cerning the nature and control of the 
several events ar». satisfactory to the 
Committee on Student Activities and 
that the Committee and the Council 
assume responsibility for proper super­
vision of the program.
James B. Ashwell was appointed 
General Chairman by Frederick
Sangstcr, President of the Student 
Council. The ’following appointments 
were made by Mr. Ashwell and ap­
proved by the Student Council:

Atik Your Little Brother—He Knowo
Peep, Peep and Desdemona
Conspire to Seduce Bluefish
Synopsis o£ Previous Installments: 
Just why Dcsdamona Dc Vorie in­
sisted on working nobody but herself 
knew. For she was beautiful beyond 
description and had had regiments 
of admirers ever since she riiade her 
debut. Her father was H. T. Du 
,Vorie and by that we mean the II. 
T. Dc Vorie of llte Dc Vorics.. But 
the social life began to pall so 
Dcsdamona took a secretarial course 
and secured a position. In the law 
office where she. workn there is u 
young attorney, Byron Bluefish, who 
is exceedingly handsome but tragical­
ly poor. Dcsdamona and Byron >vere 
instantaneously and simultaneously at­
tracted to cach other. Dcsdamona is 
making an' effort to prevent Byron 
.from knowing v‘ >, she really is as 
she is afraid that their love life will 
be ruined if he ever gains this 
knowledge. Byron wants to. marry 
Dcsdamona but he has the responsi­
bility of his aged great uncle in 
Abyssinia to whom he sends half of 
his earnings. ».
Love Flame Lives On
Naturally, this is an impediment to 
the union of the happy lovers but the 
flame of ‘their love continues to burn 
in spite of the fact that it cannot be 
fed with the fuel of luxury. One 
night Byron and Dcsdamona go for 
a ride into the country and after 
they arc about forty-five kilometres 
from the city, Byron’s motor stalls 
and upon examination he discovers 
that about fifty per cent of his 
motor is shot to—, well, anyway, 
it was in pretty bad shape. The 
hour is well past midnight and there 
is no possible way of returning to 
town. An old farmhouse will offer 
them shelter but only from the stormy 
elements, not from the tongues of 
the gossips.' They arc certainly in 
a quandary as to what to do. NOW 
GO ON WITH THE STORY I
Rastus and Razor
"Rastas, is you all rievch gonna 
get ready? You knows this is the 
night the daughters of Bathsheba has 
thcah annual-jubilee,’'
"Ah’s coming’, honey, Ah’s coming. 
Wher’ did you all put that razah—
the one fo’ social puhposcs. That 
low life Mose may be there an^ Ah 
ain't fogot what happened at the las’, 
annual jubilee of the daughtahs of 
Bathsheba.”
"Rastas, if you all don’’hurry, All’s 
goin’ without you. You knows all’s 
the sociable committee."
From across the street come the 
sounds of the Marine Band, and the 
tune of' “Over There” is wafted into 
the spring air. Excitement in every- 
vyhsre, for is not this the night when 
Cblonel Florian Howitzer of the 
257 !4 tli returns from his glorious 
war career to be greeted by the 
proud and smiling faces of his 
friends and other fellow citizens of 
Apex, North Dakota.
Receives Ovation
At exactly the appointed hour, the 
train pulls in, he steps to the plat­
form and receives the ovation which 
lie undeniably deserves. Only one 
thing spoils the atmosphere of com­
plete pride and joy. Evry onu is 
wondering whether Florian has for- 
gotten Little Camille Pumphandlc, the 
girl he left behind. One noticus 
him searching the crowd. Hurrah, he 
has not forgotten her, for surely his 
expression could not be mistaken for 
that of anyone buf. an impatient lover. 
Little does lie know that at this mo­
ment, Camille of the fair curls is 
pining away in her little white bed, 
going into a decline with rapidity 
Will lie be able to get to her iti 
time to save the delicate thread. of. 
her life which the fates arc haggling 
over?
Desert Sun Passes Out
And now, the desert sun. is set­
ting, a purple glow is radiated over 
the sands of the Sahara. All is 
quiet, all is tranquil. Chief Awah 
takes his docile bride for whose hand 
he has fought these many months 
and carries her into his ancestral 
tent, according to a long established 
custom of the .desert. The moon too 
is happy and smiles with paternal 
benevolence on the happy lovers as 
they smile qt each. other.

the I’lumpdoodle and Corn variety. 
Here is the gist of her spccch, 
minus a few of its most expressive 
profanities, plus a bit more gram­
matical construction. It is the swan 
song of any hope that friendliness 
might occur between the two wide­

HANG IT? OR WORSE
It is really an enjoyable experience 
to be hung. This complar t observa­
tion is emitted by our ever-shock­
ing or charetting architects at their 
annual spring spasm of the blasphemy 
of Arts last name.
An ominous tablet marks the gates 
of Arts School's midget myscum of 
Architectural purgatory. “An exhibit,” 
it reads, "of the vain attempts of 
Architectural students under the sul­
phurous compulsion of Messrs. S. & 
tt. at the kind condescension of lads 
who forsook their penny pitching and 
self-serenading for easel and char­
coal.
Lead on I O Virgil, I loath this 
Charon guy.
Taken all in one shot, as Purga­
tory should be, the show is as de­
generate as might be expected of such 
puerile talent. (() Its roll of names 
is a parade of shallow wits and artis­
tic conceit. Mitchell, Worland, Flana­
gan, Geer, McKcever, Rudick, Swcm, 
Richards, and Montgomery arc ag­
gravated. cases.The antichambcr recks of horses 
necks and sideshow freaks (its weird 
anatomy.)Here is the. only gracious glimmer 
in’ the whole hole. As Architects 
they should stick to their own line. 
Here we sec one or two hopeful 
glorifications of the American Cathe­
dral of Learning. Drawings, made 
a year ago, {ire as true as to­
morrow's photo and one attempt 
might even be termed visionary. The 
only guy that believes in the Pitt 
pike pole sells roofing.
Diving into the inner depths we 
catch them in their deceit. To aug­
ment their boast, they have set up 
examples of former talent. A whole­
sale bluff are the drawings of Carr, 
Hamilton, McKinney, Tierney, Wild, 
Covert, Wisman, Ross’ and Kirby, 
all graduates. But no avail. The 
strategem is not improved by further 
stain of inferiority.A few outstandingly imbecilic 
drawings are worth mention. If we 
could do anything like Robertson’s 
Test drawing, we would quit report­
ing and register in. Arts. Jones W. 
Glynn has a viscious looking I-Icander- 
thal grapplcr in brown crayon and 
W..B. O’Neal has a redman caught 
in'the act.—a la Boston Tea Parly. 
In their own classes there arc none 
lower than T. Frasier Smith's figures 
or sprightlier than Tom Pratt’s 
action sketches. Sherwood, Kisling, 
Montgomery and Ralston arc in 
there with enteur bushej.
And so about ti e cell. Cast, Com­
position, Action-skctch, and Life 
drawipg qf hitherto inconnuc, who 
should have been hung long ago.
"You stuclc-;up Maggie Murphs 
have no right to label us • 'catty’— 
you don’t even give us a break, 
and when you learn that a girl is 
an Art student, she is automatically 
condemned; you say, 'Oh, well,

Here the debate proper ended, 
and the free-for-all began, and 
none too soon wc left the speci­
mens of America's young- worn- 
enhood. busily engaged in proving 
the ancient maxim that "Might 
Makes Right;”
Center Graft
One of the most sensational ex­
poses in the history of the Car­
negie Institute of Technology is 
the discovery of a clearing house 
pool that is being conducted from 
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house at 
4915 Forbes street, under the spe­
cial direction of that financial gen­
ius, David Harold Eldredgc Gentcr. 
It is'.alleged that this is one of,, the 
largest, if not the largest, of the 
pools in operation in the city.
It seems that the expose was 
made when Dean Tarbcll became 
suspicious because of the many 
letters that lie was receiving from 
parents of students who had been 
demanding increased allowances. 
Disguised as an employe of the 
American Reduction Company, Mr. 
Tarbell entered the residence of 
the brotherhood and found Mr. 
Genter giving filial instructions to 
the pledges whom - he uses as 
bookies.
'In interview, Mr. Genter main­
tained his usual Coolidgian silence 
and refused at first to make any 
statement. He was finally induced, 
however, to give a very brief no­
tice to the press. It is as follows: 
“The original purpose of the for­
mation of the pool was based on 
purely philanthropic and altruistic 
motives. Being prompted by the 
splendid work of the Women’s 
Scholarship Organization wc wish­
ed to aid in the noble cause of 
furnishing extra funds to needy 
students. Well acquainted as wc 
are with the average financial sta­
tus of the Carnegie Tech student,- 
we attempted to aid the student 
body iit' obtaining what is some­
times vulgarly termed ‘easy money. 
The results of the proposition have 
not been precisely a fulfillment of 
the original purposes, but it has 
at least aided that part of the stu­
dent body affiliated with the glori­
ous brotherhood of Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon. In] conclusion, let' me 
state, that never in our most wild 
imaginings did we hope for such 
an astounding and breath-taking 
outcome.”'
Fisher’s actually gets up and walks 
away.
Rumor has it that there arc two 
trade journals/ on the local campus, 
the Phi Psi .house organ, known to 
you as the Puppet, and' the Beta 
Bugle, called the Tartan. There is 
also a rumor to the effect that these 
two'fraternities aroi going: to Me' the

Household Hints
Jello is very tasty and chewy 
when silver polish, sasparillo, chew­
ing gum and whole marshmallows 
arc added. It is advisable to use 
the wrong ends of the spoons or 
to use knives when eating this as 
a dessert, but no implements arc 
needed when this is served as soup.
Very good sandwiches can be 
made by chopping up old rubber 
or leather soles, nuts, pickles, and 
carrots and spreading very thin 
ever a slice of stale bread. At 
Carnegie Tech Grill, where these 
sandwiches originated and where 
millions of old shoes are used daily 
to make such sandwiches, which 
arc either callcd Tutti Fruitti, 
T ropical or some other undescrib­
ing name, the students simply gob­
ble them down whole; it being im­
possible to chew them with any 
relish or mustard.
The A. S. M. E., Specialists on 
how best to serve your home-cook­
ed meals, have decided that the 
proper way to serve soup, is in 
glasses with straws, while spaghetti 
should be served on spools, furnish­
ing scissors for cutting, if neces­
sary. This’ society for improve­
ment of household methods, has. 
also stated that cooking is greatly 
aided if celluloid pots and pahs
are used, while it is a great help 
at the table to use rubber forks 
and paper knives.
Many housewives have found it 
much more convenient to keep an 
axe in the kitchen table drawer, in­
stead of several dozen useful can 
openers. The can openers can be 
used for one purpose only, whereas 
the axe has many different uses. 
The axe comes in handy to open 
cans, chop ice, open gin bottles, 
and chase the ice man away when 
he gets too troublesome. The axe 
may also be used to chop up meat 
and other tough and resisting kitch­
en material
If your mechanical ice box gives 
you any trouble, draw out the 
crank case, empty the radiator, pull 
out the floor boards, and use it 
for a clothes cupboard or otherwise. 
Then, the furnace or cake box can 
be used as a refrigerator by simply 
caljing on the ice man.- If he is 
not at home, leave your calling 
card' and he will return your visit 
promptly.
For any advice on household 
duties,, address your questions to 
Dean Mary Watson Green, in care 
of t-his sno.ozcpaper and maybe. I 
can dissolve your problems in dish­
water.

‘-By ARTHUR SCATTERBRAIN“
Spend six hours driving through 
the beauteous expenses of Schenlcy 
Park, and find that, in comparison, 
the labyrinth of Crete was as straight 
as a run in a stocking. This won­
derful Park's motto is, "Never go in 
one mile where you can go in ten."
•„Twenty, feet south-east of this spot 
is one of the finest hunting grounds 
in the world. In about that many 
jumps you are at the towering Mar­
garet Morrison woods. There you 
find one of the world’s few remain­
ing natural game preserves, wild birds, 
all kinds of deer, and close by, 
streams of fish.
This summer one piece bathing suits 
will supplant entirely the old two 
piece outfits, according to the Dant- 
zen Knitting Company. Their slogan 
for the coming season, is “Don’t sell 
this country shorts.”
Twenty years ago Bob Rinaker be­
gan life as a barefoot boy; today he 
lias fifteen men working for him. 
He is pledge .master of Delta Tau

more men like John Barrymore.
Major Stanton, the wise and ef­
ficient member of our Civil Engine­
ering Department, has only recently 
returned from a trip to the depths 
of darkest Chicago. The Major made 
the trip accompanied only by a rattle­
trap automobile and a pair of 
knickers. As long as this country 
has men who will wear knickers to 
Chicago, we have little to fear. 3rave 
Major Stanton!
Scientists have figured it out that, 
in 1,000,000,000 years, the sun will 
be as cold as a pretty plebc at a 
tea dance. When such a condition 
comes to pass, everything pretty and 
beautiful will shrivel up and wither 
away. Then you and I will hunt and 
fish for each other in order to live, 
and each individual will develop an 
attitude of pessimism equal only to 
that of Sparky McGowan. What arc 
you doing tc keep the sun warm?
The Dragons, our noble and very 
efficient Senior honorary, are doing

In a recent visit over vast anJ ex­

tried to slake his thirst by attempting 
to purchase a glass of' milk at a

the • Mexican waitress understand 
what was wanted, our noble Puppet 
editor drew a picture of a cow on 
a picce of paper and was rewarded 
with tickets for a bullfight. Mr. 
Holvcrstott should know better than

Prof. Follows, recently returned 
from a visit to thy Riyerlevy-Rankliu 
Packing Company, reports that r c 
hundred pigs arc slaughtered there 
every day except . Sundays. And 
not only docs this horrible state of 
affairs exist, but, after the slaughter, 
every hair is shaved off the animals 
and they are hung up, with no 
-covering, in an ice cold room. Put 
yourselves in their place, perturbed

an ice cold room, all bare-naked?
While away on his journey, our 
noble Englishman, who has lived in 
this country' for four years, and is 
still English, won the hot dog eat­
ing contest, leading the entire Senbr

Only recently, President Baker cele­
brated his one-hundred-fifth birthday. 
It is at this tender age that the 
thinking facilities of the average in­
dividual are functioning properly.
‘ President Baker says that his long 
life is due to the fact that he is

If the average business man would 
follow his advice, the work of our

much easier.
Foolish Americans pay twenty-five 
iollars to see two of our brutish 
nanhood fight for some ten odd 
minutes. When we think of this, 
we all begin to wonder why we go 
to college. The only thing is, most 
of us are little bitsy monkeys, while 
the prize fighters are great big goril­
las. That is why Emery Homer 
Sutch, the haberdasher, is reading 
so many Tarzan books.
Doris Mather, campus fashion ex­

two pets Roy and Emma, and is 
going to start a society whicti is to 
be known as the "Society for Pro­

fact that the goldfish might fail ic

Miss AbbotSenior Civil
Found Brutally 
Murdered
Miss Fussy Abbot, mistress of 
the Carnegie Tech practice house, 
was found murdered in her boudoir 
this' morning by Bill Milliron, archi­
tect, of 5035 Forbes street. Coron­
er (cowboy) Jack Horning declared 
that Miss Abbot had been dead 
about two hours before she was 
found.
Dcteclive-Inspector Bob Boyd 
told reporters that a motive for the 
crime had not, as yet, bceji un­
covered by t*he police.- “We have 
hit on several clues,” said Boyd, 
but have nothing for publication. 
Right now everyone is suspected.” 
Fussy’s death was a distinct sur­
prise to the members of the House­
hold ’ Economics department with 
whom she is very popular. "I just 
can’t believe it,” said Rosemary 
Barr when told of the tragedy. 
“Fussy, I mean Miss Abbot, was 
one of my dearest friends.” Mary 
Hall, when told of the incident, 
fainted in the arms of Mr. Milliron 
who was still around.
Andy Yerina, chairman of the 
Student Council Investigation Com- 
mittee was non-communicativc 
when interviewed in his office this 
morning. “I’ll start an investiga­
tion,” he said. “If there is anything 
to be gotten out of this I’ll get it,’’ 
was his terse comment.
Miss Abbot, who has been at 
Carnegie too long, was very popu­
lar with all who knew her. She
had a reputation of being very
liberal with the girls who worked 
for her and was known for her
willingness- to allow them to go 
out on dates whenever they desired. 
“She was so kind, so good-natured,
-------!” said Isobel Sheppard. “I
just know we will miss her.”

the house at the time has not, as
Gets Job
There was jubilation in the offices 
of the Civil Engineering Department 
when it was announced that at last 
a Senior Civil had been offered a 
job.
Just what the job was or who 
the extremely fortunate student is, 
could not be learned, for Professors 
McCullough, Stanton, Evans, Daniels, 
Thomas, and Davis immediately went 
out on a spree to celebrate the 
blessed, event.
Dame Rumor lias it that the ingcn- 
ous Civil who obtained the offer in­
terviewed his prospective employer 
disgusted as a Builder. This was 
easily done since he smeared his 
face with soot before he entered the 
Conference Room. He cautiously ap­
proached the employment agent and 
sweetly sang, “Here am I.” The 
employment agent was so bewitched 
by the beautiful tenor of the Civil 
that -lie swayed to and fro to the 
rhythm and purred. Taking advantage 
of the agent’s weakened condition, 
the civil crooned: “You want engine­
ers that are civil, don't you?” Not 
•realizing what the nefarious student 
meant, the agent said, “Yes.” And 
that, dear children, is how a Civil 
finally got a job.

GOOD NEWS OF 
GOOD TIMES!
Prosperity is returning; it is amongst us; in fact it is here! Who can refute these random bits of evidence gathered irrationally and un­
thinkingly from nowhere'
1. The revival of the Carne­
gie Carnival has the most promis­
ing industry in East Liberty work­
ing twenty-four hours a day. Bar­
rels, corks, yeast and bottles are 
all selling at a premium in antici­
pation of the student needs.

school the other day in a taxi cab!
3. Spring is coming — another 
Scotchman threw out his Christ­

4. Another senior Civil got a

5. Then again the coming of spring heralds the opening of Schenlcy Park and what could be better evidence of good times ahead?
FLEEING MEMBERS TRACKED TO LAIR
1,00 Barrels Mash Destroyed
’lceing from shots .fired by United 
States prohibition agents, three alleged 
members of the 'lortar Board were 
trapped in a private dining room of 
the Club Alabam where they' con­
fessed to operating the still shown 
above at their cottage, Sky High. 
After, a fierce battle with the agents 
in which the polic? had to subdue 
them with their' blackjacks, the fol­
lowing women were arrested; Har­
riet Hanna, alias “Slooey the Dip," 
age 41; Isabel Sheppard, age 11 
months; and Helen Whitchill, alkis 
“Second-story Sue,” age 9.
The police obtained the tip through 
the chairman of the Catr.nus Purity 
League, S. Laurclle Holverstott, who 
became suspicious at the actions of 
Cora Lee Hcnk, age 6, at the Wom­
en’s Junior Prom. Madame Hcnk, 
who in addition to being a member 
of Mortar, is a Black Bottom dan­
cer of note, was secti entering the 
Prom wearing a silk high hat and 
two alleged male Drama students 
on either arm. As she approached 
the reception line, she opened up a 
bottle of sloe gin and poured it 
down the back of Dean Green’s 
decollete gown. With a horrified 
shriek, brave Laurelle dashed'to the 
rescue and by use of brute strength 
wrung a confession from the alleged 
drunk Madame Henk.
When this information had been 
communicated to the police, they 
dashed to the Mortar Board hang­
out “Sky High” on the Butler Pike 
where they found an immense still 
and 1,000 barrels of mash. The 
women operating the still escaped by 
sliding down a rain-spout and csc::.i- 
ing in a Fordson tractogj The 
police pursued them to the Club 
Alabam on Wylie avenue where they 
were holding a bake sale and a tea 
dance.
Confronted by the confession of 
Madame Hcnk, the women broke 
down and admitted their guilt, po­
lice say. They confessed that they 
were a part of a nation-wide boot­
leg ring and had enrolled in Car­
negie Tech in order to conceal their 
operations. They admitted that they 
had been selling liquor on the campus 
and gave out a list of Faculty 
members who were .their customers. 
They testified that the only depart­
ment which did not purchase their 
liquor was the Chemistry department, 
giving the reason that the 'chemists 
made home brew in Organic Lab.
As a result of this exposure, the 
entire campus is aroused, since there 
is no' liquor supply. now available.

the committee.

more funds.”

self.”
"What plans did you make to get 
the money?"
“Wc came to the conclusion that 
we could make some quick cash 
through Bake Sales!"
“How much did you make on 
your first sale?"
"After the treasure;* took her 
rake-off we had a profit of $3.79.

. The august body of the Carnegie 
Campus, the Student Council, wa: 
supposed to meet at 7:30 last Tues­
day. As usual very few were there 
at that time, but .by 7:40 most of 
the members had straggled in 
ready to conduct the importan 
business of the evening. Mr. San 
ster, president of the Council, had 
not yet come; he was down in the 
“Y” office receiving his last min­
ute schedule of procedure from Mr. 
Davis: As soon as he. arrived, he
requested the roll call; after this 
had been completed he began with 
the business, but a clamor arose 
from the . male chorus. Mr. Sang- 
ster peered at them inquiringly, 
Mr. Ashwell, spokesman for the 
occupiers of the arm chairs—the 
women were seated in the straight 
backed, uncomfortable chairs on 
the other side of the room—asked 
in • his suave, soothing voice, if :i 
quorum was present. Mr. Sahgste: 
looked annoyed and flustered, but 
managed to ask his left-hand worn 
an, Miss Montgomery, if business 
could proceed. Upon being assur­
ed that a quorum was present, th 
president cleared his throat and in 
formed his spell-bound listeners 
that matters of vast importance 
had to be decided.
Just as he was beginning to ex 
plain matters to the best of hi, 
ability, Ken Owens, chairman of 
the Budget Committee, appeared in 
the doorway. Immediately .the 
members of the budget committee 
arose and filed otit sedately—all 
except Mr, Tomer, who walked 
naturally. A few minutes later 
(Continued on Page Six)
Much interest has been manifested 
here on the campus and elsewhere in 
the recent announcement by the 
Board of Trustees that $100,000 had 
been voted for the equipping of a com­
bined smoking and barroom in Mar- 
gcrct Morrison College. The need 
for such a room, long felt by the 
girls, is finally to be met in a truly 
regal fashion.
This $100,000 appropriation has en­
abled the girls to go ahead with 
tentative plans for the heretofore 
visionary den. They hope to locate 
the room on the first floor where 
the obsolete Bi 'ogy Lab is now 
situated. The space available will 
admit of a twenty foot bar, besides 
providing room for ample sofas and 
lounges. Storage barrels with indi­
vidual taps and distinctive steins and 
glasses are to be features of the 
bar. The installation of any and all 
modern inventions for the further- 
ence of the art of scientific and in­
telligent cocktail mixing will be seen 
to by the girls. In fact, this new 
smoking salpn and barroom will serve 
th- double purpose of a lounging 
room and a laboratory where students 
may practice the exact arts of'non­
chalant tobaccp consumption and dex­
trous mixing of spirituous drinks.
The present smoking cupboard, 
which has' been in use for over a 
hundred and fifty days, has proved 
extremely inadequate. Lack of modern 
facilities and comforts has seriously 
retarded the ' progress of the large 
groups which meet there daily. A 
noticeable scarcity of safety matches 
and Turkish gold-tipped cigarets has 
hampered them co Hulcrably. Further­
more they have been forced into the 
very lamentable habit of covering 
the holes in the rugs by rather un­
even ably distributed ashes. As for 
the chairs, they are not what thcv 
might he, since all efforts to have 
them repaired and repain' ' at inter­
vals by recalcitrant freshmen have 
merely resulte' in the appearance of 
hybrid signs which invite the weary 
to squat crosslcgged in the corners 
or suffer damaging consequences to 
the ensemble.
The most undesirable condition 
which Margaret Morrison, girls hayc 
had to endure is the absence of any

facilities for liquid refreshment what­
soever. The present deplorable situa­
tion reached a climax recently during 
the contest sponsored by the Inter­
national Association of Wine Tasters, 
when not a single Carnegie girl was 
able to qualify for the finals. The 
embarrassment and dismay of the 
faculty was intense, and resulted in 
their whole-hearted support of the 
present project. In additior, the heads 
of the departments of science and 
household arts are conferring upon 
the proposed program for a course 
in. Liquor Mixtures. Such a course 
is thought necessary and advisable 
to be added to the existing' cur­
riculum, in order that the situation 
just mentioned may be -prevented 
from recurring. They have encoun­
tered some opposition, which was to 
be expected, from the men, who ob­

Six students and eight faculty 
members were injured during a 
three-hour riot:, which took place 
when the faculty tried to break up 
the Volstead Enforcement meeting, , 
held in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
fraternity house last night. The 
faculty, armed with the liquor bot­
tles which they had emptied earlier 
in the evening, swooped down on 
the unsuspecting students jusL at 
the time that Tank Wighberger, na­
tionally known prohibition l’cad'cr, 
was addressing his followers.
The following faculty members 
and students were injured:
Mary Green, aged 17—Honolulu (head injuries).
Art Shires Tarbell; aged 8—Mc­

Charles Selsam, aged 18—(water

Frankie Foote, aged 21—(broken

Carol Reese, no age—(brokcrt

As the faculty horde advanced 
upon the house, the outraged stu­
dents grabbed what little furniture 
there was available and, despite 
the brave efforts of Barto Griffisa 
artd Lizzie Dcmarcst, the faculty 
was repulsecl. The hero of the 
hour was Roily Davis, faculty Y* 
M. C. A. leader who, through su­
perhuman efforts, picked Tank 
Highberger, leader of the anti- 
booze force, right off the ground 
and tossed him over onto the 
Sigma Nu front porch. At this 
juncture, Lcn Schnupp and Don, 
Lovewell were forced to yank the 
infuriated Y. M. C. A. man off 
Highbcrgcr’s back.

Order of Steins, and former side­
kick of Willie the Kaiser, lias an­
nounced his engagement to a well-

during which time lie palmed him­
self off as Fritz, the gardener. Von 
Corshenhausen was extremely reti­
cent about his fiancee- as well as 
his disguise as a gardener, although 
he intimated that, he was collecting 
collegiate dope for Der Kaiser.
When interviewed, Von Corshy 
stated that lie first scraped an 
acquaintance with his fiancee while 
scraping snow off the pavements 
between M, M. and the practkc 
house. Von stated that their brief 
acquaintance rapidly ripened into 
something beautiful, a tender and 
beautiful amour. He explained that 
the idyll has had as beautiful a 
setting as any of the comparable 
affairs of history. Helen of Troy 
may have had Sparta, and Sappho 
( her Lesbos, Cleopatra the Nile, and 
Guinevere, Camelot, but -Von Cor- •

Never in the sex life of Carnegie 
ha:; such a peak been attained.
A honeymoon is being planned 
by the couple, a tour of all thq 
most famous trysting places of his­
tory. In France they will visit the 
Gardens of Versailles where in the 
days of Antoimiettc powdered wig 
brushed against powdered wig; in 
Vienna they will stroll down the 
boulevards where in pre-war days 
gilded women rode to the opera 
escorted by sartorially perfect 
gentleman; to Madrid where dark­
eyed, red-lipped ladies of the cvcn- 
in have been serenaded by fascinat­
ing matadors ever since the begin­
ning of time; and lastly to Venice 
where they will leisurely float down 
the canal, with only the musical 
call of the gondoliers to interrupt 
their hushed murmurings.
After this romantic and eventful 
tour the young lovers will be at 
home to their friends and . well- 
wishers at the Hotel Strand.............

CORRECT MANNERS
By
Mrs. Cornclie Bookman
Dear Mrs. Bockman—
The other day some member of a 
fraternity far, far up on . Forbes 
street informed us that it was not 
proper for the members of our 
brotherhood to lounge on the front 
porch in’ shirt sleeves or sweaters 
after six p. m. e.i week days, and 
any time on Sundays. Now Mrs. 
Bockman, some of our boys have 
never heard of this new ruling, and 
we would like to know whither we 
were being taken for a ride, or not.
ricasc let us know about this as 
soon as you possibly can, for warm 
weather is about here and it is going 
to be a .vital question with us and 
that bunch up on the hill.
Sincerely,
The Sig Alph- Gang.
Dear Sig Alphs—
It is most certainly appropriate for 
you to lounge on" your own front 
porch in whatever garb you may 
choose. Don’t let those chaps 
on the hill tell you what to do. And 
by the way, did you know that Pitt 
beat California on the coast last 
fall?
Yonrs for shirt sleeves,
Mrs. Bockman.
Dear .Mrs. Bockman—
Out here at dear old Carnegie 
Tech we have a group of big shots, 
composed of our great, big, bad, 
bold athletes who have formed the 
Double ‘O’- club. Our big delight is 
to gather around the entrance to the 
Field house and gaz2 inten'tl;* at the 
fair maids of Carnegie as they piss 
in review. Our leader is a boy by .the 
name of Chuck Miller, who in addi­
tion to being the longest gazer, has a 
voice that can be heard all oyer the 
campus.
Recently we- were told that this 
ancient and honorable custom of ours 
was quite annoying to the opposite 
sex, but w.c can’t see how the ad­
miring •glances of such heroes.as our­
selves could be < '.jnoxious to any of 
the ' clinging, vines on our campus. 
Won’t you 'please • let us know how 
true this •criticism is?
S’long, '
Tlie Brave Athletes of Carnegie.
Dear Double ‘O’ Club—
I was .very glad to hear from you 
concerning this matter, for some of 
the girls from Maggi.c Murph told 
me that they were so very grateful 
to you boys for this little considera­
tion] of yours that they were going 
to present all of you with beautiful 
broadcloth rompers. Mr. Miller is 
going to receive a pair, with silk 
ribbons on the sides for his addi­
tional vocal efforts.
Yolirs,
Mrs. Bockman.
Dear .Mrs. Bockman—
Tire other day a policeman stopped 
me on the boulevard and told me
that I was to appear in court for
speeding. Now, Mrs. Bockman, 1 
was only doing sixty miles an hour, 
so I called him a dumb flat-foot, 
and lie socked me with a club lie
carried. Well, after that, I called

To provide telephone service of na­
tional scope, to manage and develop 
properties valued at more than three and 
three-quarter billion dollars, to maintain an 
organization of more than 400,000 people 
at highest efficiency — such work spurs 
the creative thought of men of the high­
est calibre.
Within the Bell System many have 
achieved outstanding success. Their work
is not only in pure science and engineering, 
but in organization and management, in 
salesmanship, financial administration, eco­
nomics and the many other fields vital to 
the growth of so great an enterprise.
Because of these men the Bell System is 
able to furnish the best all-around telephone 
service in the world. A progressive policy 
puts at their disposal every aid that a great

The appointment of Sigmundj 
Laurcilc Holvcrs'.ott to the office of 
president of the campus Purity 
League has 1/fccn announced by For- 
tunatus Arthus Franzcn, faculty ad­
visor of the League. This office 
which is the mo’st sought after posi­
tion on the campus, was awarded to 
Laurclie as the result of his fire 
work as "under-cover” man for the 
purity League. As Mr. Franzer. 
laid, Laurellc is the finest example 
af pure youth, high ideals, and 
whiskey detector on the campus and 
lliat there was no -doubt that the 
ixistcnce of whisky on the campus 
vould vanish through the cndcavcrs 
)f Sigmund Laurellc.Sigmund Laurellc is well-known on 
the campus as the editor of the 
Puppet, alleged humorous monthly. 
With his customary virtue and -vigor, 
Sigmund Laurellc has constantly kept 
the Puppet free from suggest.ve 
stories and the usual black-jacking 
of fraternities which has been the 
policy of former editors, with tuc 
result that the entire Puppet (loth 
Pages) is full of nothing but |ood. 
clean fun.Sigmund Laurellc was born iv The 
hills of Kentucky with a silver spoon 
irom Gammon’s in his mouti and 
was such a precocious baby that on 
the day of his birth, he enchanted 
the neighbors by singing, “Why was 
I born ?’’ He first attended the ex­
clusive school at Morganza and later 
attended Huntington where he was 
awarded a scholarship for his prize 
biography, “Henry Bunker, Jr., the 
Boy Ideal.”With his customary good judgment, 
lie chose Carnegie as his Alma Mam­
my and came here determined to 
make Carnegie students pure and 
virtuous like himself. His success 
here is so well-known that there is 
no need to relate it in these columns.
When asked what lie thought of 
Carnegie women, Laurclie said with 
his usual quaint humor, ‘ Check and 
double check.” He added that liis 
greatest ambition was to make Lhc 
Puppet into a literary magazine with 
a page devoted to hymns and the 
rest'of the book filled with eulogies 
of the members of Phi Kappa- Psi 
fraternity, the club and home for iged and decrepit Exchange Editors.
COMMITTEE POISONED
(Continued from Page Three)
"Betty said she could make a 
poison in Chem Lab that killed 
rats in twenty-four hours. She 
said we could canvas the town and 
rid Pittsburgh of rats."
“Did you?”"No, Nancy Newman, another 
officer, said she had a better plan, 
so we tried it. It worked wonder­
fully for nine months. We had 
a bake sale and doped Bye cents 
worth of fudge with, the rat poison 
and placed this on a separate plate,”
"Who made the fudge?”
"Miss . Glcndon, the M. M. C. C. 
cooking professor."
"Did she put the poison in the 
candy?""No. • Her. candy always tastes 
that way so we decided to put the 
poison in it without her knowing 
iboul. our plan.”
The" president then described how 
they perfected their plans. The 
first batch of poisoVi candy was 
bought by Miles Kolb,. a dramatic 
student. Secretary Steele then 
hastened to the Long Life Insur­
ance and took out a $1,000 policy 
on said Miles Kolb. Being a dra­
matic student, Kolb did. not pass 
away until three days later and the 
committee cashed in on their first 
policy. This was so successful that 
v» was repeated about every month 
for six months. Every experiment 
was more successful than the pre­
ceding one until last month’s bake 
»ale.Secretary Called As Witness
Attorney Foote, asked Lieberman 
to take the witness' stand. The 
court adjourned for five minutes 
while the prim treasurer powdered 
her nose, manicured her nails, and 
replaced the much worn coat of 
lipstick. Court resumed as Lieber­
man crossed her legs and declared 
herself ready.
"Miss Lieberman, you are Treas­
urer of the Women’s Scholarship 
Organization, are you not?"
“I am."
"Did you or did you not have a 
date at the Win. Penn Hotel on 
February 10?"
.“I did."
"Did you pay the admission 
charge with a $15 bill?”
Defense Attorney Lippert ' ob­
jected.
Judge Munhall sustained the ob­
jection declaring the question ir- 
revelant.
Lieberman was on the stand for 
twenty minutes. . She seemed to 
enjoy every minute of it. She ad­
mitted paying her’ tuition and buy­
ing a roadster with the money obtained 
from the ^insurance policies but 
stated that the other officers re­
ceived1 plenty of sugar for .them­
selves.
• Suspicion was first directed 
towards,- the committee following 
the last sale. .Some unexplainable 
accident, the plates was taken out 
for the wrong pers.om After-.-¿the 
customary three days during which 
the patient showed no signs of 
kicking off, the committee began 
to worry. They were sure some 
of the candy was poisoned and 
were afraid that perhaps they them­
selves had partaken,-of the doped 
pieces.
Dective. Horn-in of the Burnt 
Detective Agency was the next 
witness.
“Were you hired by thè Life 
Long Insurance Company to in­
vestigate thè numerous 3 day.cash- 
ins?"
“Yes."
"What did you discover, if any­
thing?"
"I found that the policies were 
always- taken out on the day of the 
Bake Sales an^ money collected 
three days later.”
Horn-in - then told how. lie had 
managed to buy some of the doped 
candy. He took the candy to Dr. 
James, of C. I. T.'s Chemistry De­
partment.
Dr. James, on being called to the 
stand,, testi’ficd that the candy con­
tained paris . green, bichloride of
mercury, and Moreline’s beer suffi­
cient to kill a liorsc in two days 
or a college student in three days.
The State concluded its case and 
the defense had very little to say.
After deliberating exactly four 
minutes the jury returned a verdict 
of guilty and recommended that 
Judge, Munhall ..show no leniency 
to the instigators of the dastardly 
crimes.
Judge- Munhall sentenced; Ander­
son, Steele,. Lieberman, and New­
man immediately.
“You four women are examples 
•of a very dangerous clique that is 
a constant terror.to the innocent 
people of the nation. For .this 
reasoii, I- shall show' no leniency

It was down in Risedorph’s pool room, in the water in the gym, 
Oh, the races were run as usual, and a goodly crowd was

On the right stood Joe McHusus, his eyes had a goofy look,
He was bound to win the next race, or be pulled out by the hook. 
But the odds were all against him, for he swam like a cannon ball; 
So the Kappa Kegs were lucky, to get any points at all.
Oh, the D. U.’s were successful, in taking away the cup,
But the final score showed only, that they were six points up. 
Seven men took to the water, only six of them did NIP2n back;

Miss 
Found Brutally
Murdered
Miss Fussy Abbot, mistress of 
the Carnegie Tech practice house, 
was found murdered in her boudoir 
this morning by Bill Milliron, archi­
tect, of 5035 Forbes street. Coron­
er (cowboy) Jack Horning declared 
that Miss Abbot had been dead 
about two hours before she was 
found.
Dctectivc-Inspcctor Bob Boyd 
told reporters that a motive for the 
crime had not, as yet,' been un­
covered by the police. "We have 
hit on several clues,” said Boyd, 
“but have nothing for publication. 
Right‘ now everyone ,is suspected.”
Fussy’s death was a distinct sur­
prise to the members of the House­
hold Economics department with 
whom she is very popular. “I just 
can’t believe it,” said Rosemary 
Barr when told of the tragedy. 
“Fussy, I mean Miss Abbot, was 
one of my dearest friends.” Mary 
Hall, when told of the incident, 
fainted in the arms of Mr. Milliron 
who was still around.
Andy Yerina, chairman of the 
Student Council Investigation Com- 
m i 11 e e was non-communicativc 
when interviewed in his office this 
morning. “I’ll start an investiga­
tion,” he said. “If there is anything 
to be gotten out of this I’ll get it,” 
\Vas his terse comment.
Miss Abbot, who has been at 
Carnegie too long, was very popu­
lar with all who knew her. She 
had a reputation of being very 
liberal with the girls who worked 
for her and was known for .her 
willingness to allow them to go 
out on dates whenever they desired. 
“She was so kind, so good-natured,
so--------!” said Isobel Sheppard. “I
just know we will miss her.”

a Senior Civil had been offered a

Just what the job was or who 
the extremely fortunate student is, 
could not be learned, for Professors 
McCullough, Stanton, Evans, Daniels, 
Thomas, and Davis immediately went 
out on a spree to celebrate the 
blessed event.
Dame Rumor has it that the iugcn- 
ous Civil who obtained the offer in­
terviewed his prospective employer 
disgusted as a Builder. This was 
easily done .since lie smeared his 
face with soot before lie entered the 
Conference Room. He cautiously ap­
proached the employment agent and 
sweetly sang, “Here am I.” The 
employment agent was so bewitched 
by the beautiful 'tenor of the Civil 
that he swayed to and fro to the 
rhythm and purred. Taking advantage 
of ’the agent’s weakened condition, 
the civil crooned: “You want engine­
ers that are ciyil, don’t you?’’ Not 
realizing what the nefarious student 
meant, the agent said, “Yes.” And 
that, dear children, is how a Civil 
finally got a job.

1,00 Barrels Mash Destroyed
'lccing from shots fired by United 
States prohibition agents, thrce alleged 
members of the Mortar Board were 
trapped in a private dining room of 
the Club Alabam where they con­
fessed to operating the still shown 
above at their cotta'ge, Sky High: 
After a fierce battle with the agents 
in which the polic: had to subdue 
them with their blackjacks, the fol­
lowing women were arrested: Har­
riet Hanna, alias “Sloocy the Dip,” 
age 41; Isabel Sheppard, age 11 
months; and Helen Whitehill, alias 
“Second-story Sue,” age 9.
The police obtained the tip through 
the chairman of the Campus Putfit.v 
League, S. Laurelle Holvcrstott, who 
became suspicious at the actions of 
Cora Lee Henk, age 6, at the Wom­
en’s Junior Prom. Madame Henk, 
who in addition to being a member 
of Mortar, is a Black Bottom dan­
cer of note, -Was seen entering the 
Prom wearing a silk high hat and 
two alleged male Drama students 
on cither arm. As she approached 
the reception line, she opened up a 
bottle of sloe gin arid poured it 
down the back of Dean Green’s 
decolletto gown. With a horrified 
shriek, brave Laurelle dashed to the 
rescue and by use of brute strength 
wrung ,a confession from the alleged 
drunk Madame Henk.
When this information had been 
communicated to the police, they 
dashed to the Mortar Board hang­
out “Sky' High” on the Butler Pike 
where they found an immense still 
and 1,000 barrels of mash. The 
women operating the still- escaped by 
sliding down a rain-spout and esc";»- 
itig in a Fordson tractor. The. 
police pursued them to the Club 
Alabam, on -Wylie avenue where they 
were holding a bake sale and a tea 
dance.
Confronted by the confession of 
Madame Henk, the women broke 
down and admitted their guilt,- po­
lice say. They confessed that they 
were a part of a nation-wide boot­
leg ring and had enrolled in Car­
negie Tech in order to conceal their 
operations. They admitted that thev 
had been selling liquor bn the campus 
and gave out a list of^ Faculty 
members who were their ‘customers. 
They testified that the only' depart­
ment which did not purchase their 
liquor was the Chemistry department, 
giving the reason that the chemists 
made home brew in Organic Lab.
As a result of this exposure, the 
entire campus is aroused, since there 
is no liquor supply now available.

The august body of the Carnegie. 
Campus, the Student Council, was 
¦supposed to meet at 7:30 last Tues­
day. As usual very few were there 
at that time, but by 7:40 most of 
the members had straggled in,

“Y” office receiving his last min­
ute schedule of procedure from Mr. 
Davis. As soon as he arrived, he 
requested the roll call; after this 
had been completed he began with 
the business, but a clamor arosi 
from tiie male chorus. Mr. Sang- 
ster peered at them inquiringly. 
Mr. Ashwell, spokesman for the 
occupiers of the arm chairs—the 
women were seated in the straight 
backed, uncomfortable chairs 
the other side of the room—asked 
in his suave, soothing voice, if 
quorum was present. Mr. Sangster 
looked annoyed and flustered, but 
managed to ask his left-hand wom­
an, Miss Montgomery» if business 
could proceed. Upon, being assur­
ed that a quorum was present, the 
president cleared his throat and in­
formed his . 'spell-bound .listeners 
that matters- of vast importance 
had to be decided.
Just as lie was beginning to ex­
plain matters to the best of * lii.s 
ability1-, Ken Owens, chairman of 
the Budget Committee, appeared in 
the doorway. Immediately the 
members of the budget committee 
arose and filed out sedately—all 
except Mr. Tomer, . who walked 
naturally. A few_ minutes later

Much- interest has been manifested 
here on the campus and elsewhere in 
the recent announcement by the 
Board of Trustees that $100,000 had 
been voted for the equipping of a :ora- 
bincd smoking and barroom in Mar- 
geret Morrison Collcge. The need 
for such a room,, long felt by the 
girls, is finally to be met in. a truly 
regal" fashion.
This $100,000 appropriation has en­
abled the girls to go ahead with 
tentative plans for the heretofore 
visionary den. They hope to locate 
the room bn the first floor where 
the obsolete B; ’o£y Lab is now 
situated. The space available will 
admit of a twenty foot bar, besides 
providing room for ample sofas and 
lounges. Storage barrels with indi­
vidual taps and distinctive steins and 
glasses are to be features of the 
bar. The installation of any and all 
modern inventions for the further- 
ence of the art of scientific and in­
telligent cocktail mixing will be seen 
to by the girls. In fact, this new 
smoking salon and barroom will serve 
th~ double purpose of- a lounging 
room and a laboratory where students 
may practice the exact arts of non­
chalant tobacco consumption and dex­
trous mixing of spirituous drinks.
The present smoking cupboard, 
which has been in use for over a 
hundred and fifty dayl, has proved 
extremely inadequate. Lack of modern 
facilities and comforts has seriously 
retarded the progress of the large 
groups whiclr meet there daily. A 
noticcablc scarcity of safety matches 
and Turkish gold-tipped cigarets has 
hampered them co siderably. Further­
more they have been forced into the 
very lamentable habit of covering 
the holes in the rugs by rather un- 
cvcnablv distributed ashes. As for 
the chairs, they arc not what they 
might be, sincc all efforts to have 
them repaired and rcpain- ' at inter­
vals by recalcitrant freshmen have 
merely rcsultc' in the appearance of 
hybrid signs which invite the weary 
to Squat crosslegged in the corners 
or suffer damaging ^consequences to 
the ensemble.
The most undesirable condition 
which Margaret Morrison girls -have 
had to endure is the absence of any

facilities for liquid refreshment what­
soever. The present deplorable situa­
tion rcachcd a climax recently during 
the contest sponsored by. the Inter- 
natipnal Association of Wine Tasters, 
when not a single Carriegie girl was 
able to qualify for the finals. The 
embarrassment and dismay of the 
faculty was intense, and resulted in 
their whole-hearted support of the 
present project. In addition, the heads 
of the departments of science and 
household arts are conferring upon 
the proposed program for a course 
in Liquor Mixtures. Such a course 
is thought necessary and advisable 
to be added to the existing cur­
riculum, in order that the situation 
just mentioned may • be prevented 
from recurring. They have encoun­
tered some opposition, which was to 
be expected, from the men, who ob­
ject to discrimination in favor of the

Injured List Incomplete
Six students and eight faculty 
members were injured during a 
three-hour riot, which took place 
when the faculty tried to break up 
the Volstead- Enforcement meeting, 
held in the Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
fraternity house last night. The 
faculty, armed with the liquor bot­
tles which they had emptied earlier 
in the evening, swooped down on 
the unsuspecting students just at 
the time that Tank PJighberger, na­
tionally known prohibition leader, 
was addressing his followers.
The following faculty members 
and students were injured:
Mary Green, aged 17—Honolulu 
(head injuries).
Art Shires Tarbell, aged 8—Mc­
Kees Rocks (minor cuts).
Barto Griffiss, aged 92—Home­
stead (fractured ribs).
Lizzie Demarest (no age available), 
Wylie avenue (distemper).
Roscoc Ilirig, aged 24-rNo home 
(mumps).
Gwcnnic Kieblc, aged 7—Oalc- 
mont (sprained ankle).
Chet Wallaqc, aged 82—Soho 
(burns).
Stocky Baker, aged 14—Canal street (colic).
¦ Charles Wangcman, aged 6 months 
—(dyspepsia).
David Tomer, aged 32—(frac­
tured skulls).
Ann McKee, aged 11—(sprained 
thumb).
Charles Selsam, aged 18—(water, 
on the knee).
Frankie Foote, aged 21—(broken 
neck).
Carol Reese, no age—(broken 
heart).
As the- faculty horde advanced 
upon the house, the outraged stu­
dents grabbed what little furniture 
there was available and, despite 
the brave efforts of Barto Griffiss 
and Lizzie ¦ Demarest, the faculty; 
was repulsed. The hero of the 
hour was Roily Davis, faculty Y„ 
M. C. A. leader who, through su­
perhuman efforts, picked Tank 
Highbergcr, leader of the anti­
booze force, right off the ground 
and tossed him over onto the 
Sigma Nu front porch. At this 
juncture, Len Schnupp and Don 
Lovewell were forced to yank the 
infuriated Y. M. C. A. man off 
Highberger’s back.

Frederick Von Corshenhausen
To Wed Fair Maggie Muffin
Oakland (L. P.) Tuesday — The 
Right Honorable Frederick Von 
Corshenhausen, Knight of the Ob­
long Table, Member of the Royal 
Order of Stems, and former side­
kick of Willie the- Kaiser, has an­
nounced his engagement to a well- 
known M. M. professor. Von Cor­
shenhausen has worked on the Car­
negie Campus for the last’ten years, 
during which time he palmed him­
self off as Fritz, the gardener. Von 
Corshenhausen was extremely reti­
cent about his fiancee as well as 
his disguise as a gardener, although 
he intimated that lie was collecting 
collegiate dope for Dcr Kaiser.
When interviewed, Von Corshy 
stated that he first scraped an 
acquaintance with his, fiancee while 
scraping snow off the. pavements 
between M. M. and the practice 
house/ Von stated that, their brief 
acquaintance rapidly ripened into 
something beautiful, a tender and 
beautiful amour. He explained that 
the idyll has had as beautiful a 
setting as any of the comparable 
affairs of history. Helen of Troy 
may have had Sparta, and Sappho 
her Lesbos, Cleopatra the Nile, and 
Guinevere, Cameloty -but Von Cor-
shenhausen wooed his a ii amour a ta 
in our own beloved Scheniey Park. 
Neptune heard the old, old story 
once again, but this time in 
language more touching, more real­
istically tender than ever before. 
Never in the séx life of Cariiegia 
bar, such a peak been attained.
A honeymoon is being planned 
by the couple, a tour of all tha 
most famous trysting places of his­
tory. In France they will visit tha 
Gardens of Versailles where in the 
days of Antoinncttc powdered wig 
brushed against powdered wig; in 
Vienna they will ' stroll down the 
boulevards where in pre-war days 
gilded women rode to the opera 
cscortcd by sartorially perfect 
gentleman; to Madrid where dark- 
eyed, red-lipped ladies of the cvcn- 
in have been serenaded by fascinat­
ing matadors ever sincc the begin­
ning of time; and lastly to Venicc 
where they will leisurely float down 
the canal, with only the musical 
call of the gondoliers to interrupt 
their hushed murmurings.
After this romantic and eventful 
tour the j'oung lovers will be at 
home, to their friends and well- 
wishers at the Hotel- Strand.- -

"I did.”
"Did you pay the. admission 
charge with a $15 bill?"
Defense Attorney Lippcrt ob­
jected.
Judge Munhall »sustained the ob­
jection declaring the question ir- 
revclant.
Lieberman was on the stand for 
twenty minutes. She seemed to 
enjoy every minute of it. ' She ad­
mitted paying her tuition and buy­
ing a roadster with the money obtained 
from the insurance policies but 
stated th¡it the other officers re­
ceived plenty of sugar for them­
selves.
) Suspicion was first direct c d 
towards the committee following 
the. last sale. Some unexplainable 
accident, the plates was taken out 
for the wrong person. After the 
customary three days during which 
the patient showed no signs, of 
kicking off, the committee began 
to worry. They were sure 'some 
of the candy was poisoned and 
wore afraid that perhaps they them­
selves had partaken of the doped 
pieces.
Bcctivc Horn-in of the Burnt 
Dctective Agency was the next 
witness.
“Were yon hired by the Life 
Long Insurance Company to in­
vest ¡gale the numerous .1 day cash- 
ns?"
" Yes."
“What did you discover, if any­
thing?1'
“I found that the policies were 
always taken out on the day of the 
Bake Sales and money collected 
three days later."
Horn-in then told how, he had 
managed to buy some of the doped 
candy. He took the candy to Dr.' 
James, of C. I. T,'s Chemistry De­
partment.
Dr. James, on'neing. called to the 
stand, testified that the candy con­
tained paris green, bichloride of
mercury, and Morclinc’s beer suffi­
cient to kill a horse in two days 
or a college student in three days.
The State concluded its case and 
the defense had very little to say.
After deliberating exactly four 
minutes the jury returned a verdict 
of g*uilty and recommended that 
Judge Munhall show no leniency 
to the instigators of the dastardly 
crimes.
Judge Munhall sentenced Ander­
son, Steele, Lieberman, and New­
man immediately.
"You four women arc examples 
of a very dangerous clique that is 
a constant terror to the innocent 
people of the nation. For this 
reason, I shall show no leniency 
towards, you and the court hereby 
sentences each of you to the choice 
oC a $5,000 fine and two years at

CORRECT MANNERS
By
Mr». Cornclie Bookman
Dear Mrs. Bockman—.
The other day some member of a 
fraternity far, far up on Forbes 
street informed us that it was n6t 
proper for the members of our 
brotherhood to lounge on the front 
porch in shirt sleeves or sweaters 
after six p. m. t.i week days, and 
any time on Sundays. Now Mrs. 
Bockman,' some of our boys have 
never heard of this new ruling, and 
we would like to know whether we 
were being taken* for a ride or not.
1'lcasc let us know about this as 
soon as you possibly can, for warm 
weather is about here and it is going 
to be a vital question with us an.J 
that bunch up on the hill.
Sincerely,
The Sig Alph Gang.
Dear Sig Alphs—
It is most certainly appropriate for 
you to lounge on your own front 
porch in whatever garb you may 
choose. Don’t let those chaps 
on the hill tell you what to do. And 
by the way, did ;ou know that Pitt 
beat California on the coast last 
fall?
Yours for shirt sleeves,
Mrs. Bockman.
Dear Mrs. Bockman—
Out here at dear old Carnegie 
Tech we have a group of big shots, 
composed of our great, big, bad, 
bold athletes who have formed the 
Double 'O' club. Our big delight is 
to gather around the entrance to the 
Field house and gazn intentl;- at the 
fair maids of Carnegie as they pass 
in review. Our leader is a boy by the 
name of Chuck Miller, who in addi­
tion to being the longest gazer, lias a 
voice that can be heard all over the 
campus.
Recently we were told that this 
ancient.and honorable custom of ours 
was quite annoying to the opposite 
sex, but we can’t see bow ilvi ad­
miring glances of such heroes as our* 
selves could be • bno'xious to any of 
the clinging vines on our campus. 
Won’t you please let us know how' 
true this criticism is?
S’long,
The Brave Athletes of Carnegie.
Dear Double ‘O’ Club—
1 was very glad to hear froni you 
concerning this matter, for some of 
the girls from Maggie Murpli told 
me that they were ’so very grateful 
to you boys, for this little considera­
tion of yoi\rs that they were going 
to present all of you with beautiful 
broadcloth rompers. Mr. Miller is 
going to receive a pair with silk 
ribbons on the sides for his addi­
tional vocal, efforts.'
Yours,
Mrs. Bockman.
Pear Mrs. Bockman—
The other day a policeman stopped 
me on the boulevard and told' me
that 1 was to appear in court for
speeding. Now, Mrs. Bockman, 1 
was only doing sixty miles, an hour, 
so I called him a dumb' llat-foot, 
and lie socked me with a club he
carried. Well, after that, I called 
him a lot of names, and after I
finished I don't remember., what liap- 
p'cncd, but 1 came to iii the Pres­
byterian hospital.
Please, Mrs.- Bockman, tell me why 
he did what he did. ‘
Yours, in vthe hospital,
Gco:gc Ncasc.

It was down in Riscdorph’s pool room, in the water in the gym, 
Oh, the races were run as usual, and a goodly crowd was 
there;
On the right stood Joe McHusus, his eyes, had a goofy look,
He was bound to win the next race, or be pulled out by the hook. 
But the odds were all against him, for lie swam like a cannon ball; 
So the Kappa Kegs were lucky, to get any points at all.
Oh; the D. U.’s were successful, in faking away the cup,
But the final, score showed only, that they were six points up. 
Seven men took to the water, only six of them did come back;
If anybody happens to ask you, just,tell ’em he had a camel’s pack.

visor of the League. This officc 
which is the most sought after posi­
tion on the campus, was awarded to 
Laurclie as the result of his fine 
work as "under-cover” man for the 
Purity League. As Mr. Franzcn 
laid, Laurellc is the finest example 
;>f pure youth, high ideals, and 
whiskey detector on the campus and 
that there was no doubt that the 
ixisicnce of whisky on the campus 
vould vanish through the endeavors 
)f Sigmund Laurelle.Sigmund Laurelle is well-known on 
the campus as the editor of the 
Puppet, alleged humorous monthly. 
With his customary virtue and vigor, 
Sigmund Laurellc has constantly kept 
the Puppet free from suggestvc 
stories and the usual black-jacking 
of fraternities which has been the 
policy of former editors, with wc. 
result that the entire Puppet (loth 
Pages) is full of nothing but good, 
glean fun.Sigmund Laurellc was born i.> rhc 
hills of Kentucky with a stiver spoon 
from Gammon’s in his mouti and 
was such a precocious baby that on 
the day of his birth, he enchanted 
the neighbors by singing, "Why was

clusive school at Morganza and latei 
attended Huntington where he was 
awarded a scholarship for Ins prize

Imre is so well-known that there is 
no need to relate it in these columns.
When asked what he thought of 
Carnegie women, Laurellc said with 
his usual quaint humor, "Check and

greatest ambition was to make I’le

"Betty said she could make a 
poison in Cliem Lab that killed 
ruts in twenty-four hours. She 
said we could canvas the town and 
rid Pittsburgh of rats."
"Did you?""No, Nancy Newman, another 
officer, said she had a belter plan, 
so we tried it. Jt worked wonder­
fully for nine months. We had 
u bake, sale and doped live cents 
worth of fudge with, the rat poison 
and placed this mi a separate plate."
"Who made I lie fudge?"
"Mias Glcndon, the M. M. C. C. 
cooking professor.”"Did she put the poison in the 
candy?""No. Her candy always tastes 
that way so we dccided to put the 
poison in it without her knowing 
jiboul; our plan.”The president then described how 
they perfcctcd their plans. The 
first batch of poison candy was 
bought by Miles Kolb, a dramatic 
student. Secretary Stcclc then 
hastened to the Long Life Insur­
ance and took out a $1,000 policy 
on said Miles Kolb. Being a dra­
matic student, Kolb did. not pass 
Kway until three days later and the

to relish your pipes!
Rule One for Pipe-smoking is 
“Find your tobacco.”
Rule One stops some beginners. 
They look here. They search 
there. They hunt ... we must

means Edgeworth I
Rule Two is . . but would you

To provide' telephone service of na­
tional scope, to manage and develop 
properties valued at more than three and 
three-quarter billion dollars, to maintain an 
organization of more than 400,000 people 
at highest efficiency — such work spurs 
the creative thought of men of the high­
est calibre.
Within the Bell System many have 
achieved outstanding success. Their work
is not only in pure science and engineering, 
but in organization and management, in 
salesmanship, financial administration, eco­
nomics and the many other fields vital to 
the growth of so great an enterprise.
Because of these men the Bell System is 
able to furnish the best all-around telephone 
service in the world. A progressive policy

the Cartoon Dance of the Night

After listening to the weeping 
and gnashing of teeth emanating 
from’ many of the night students’ 
•real. or fancied wrongs, it seems 
^thi\t vt|\erc is ; one general "gripe.”
Tlie basis of. this offending de­
tail is. hot localized. -lit fact it is 
so 'democratic that it ;docsn\ care, 
what school it attacks. The qotaii 
referred .to, is -the relation between 
the professors .and,v:thc.student».
It has been nqt.iced, that this 
iiuestion becomes general towards 
the end | of the / school year when 
everyone's, nerves and feelings arc 
on a ragged edge. The student 
wonders why a subject cannot be 
put across', without the wealth of 
slams . and sarcasms with which 
some of the instructor^ are wont 
to embellish their1 work—-and 
the professors wonder "how could 
anyone be so dumb?" as the aver­age student.
..When one' stops to consider the 
qu,cstionK, the fault cannot be placed 
so ;easy. We must admit that a 
professor ;is‘ entitled to due r'espcct, 
and tins respect falls to a danger­
ous minimum about this time. The 
student, too, in a number of cases, 
carries the higli-schoql notion that 
leads to a "chip on the shoulder" 
•latitude,. resulting, ;iii ,a »larked cool­
ness in the instructor’s feelings 
toward said student. '
Until the condition, obtains where 
all are willing to meet halfway and 
strike! a happy 'medium, that' does 
not; admit of ' either • irittevnization 
or open war, but rather a business­
like basis, it seems that the con­
troversy is apt to continue "adlin- 
itum." However, we do think that 
much more will be gained on both 
sides, if less criticism and sarcasm 
is practiced.—H. E. M.
Booklets To Include Night Students..
This year the commencement an­
nouncement booklets will contain a 
list of the night school students who 
arc graduating and also those who 
are to reçoive certificates. These 
booklets may be used in place of 
the regular commencement announce­
ments.
On Tuesday, Thursday and Friday 
of this week and /Tuesday, April 8, 
of next week between 7:00 and 
S:30 p. m. there will be salesman 
in the hall of the first floor of j 
Administration Hall who will take 
orders for the booklets. Samples of 
the announcei cuts will also be on 
dièplay. The booklets may be had in 
two styles ; a black leather covered 
booklet with gold C, priced at SO 
¿ents, or a white cardboard covered 
booklet tied with the Carnegie Colors 
at 25 cents. The announcements 
must be paid for when ordered.
Included in these booklets will be 
a night school section which will 
include a complete lis.t of the night 
school graduates and those who will 
receive ccrtfficatc. ; the s liors of-all 
four colleges, several attractive views 
of the campus buildings and the en­
tire program of commencement week.
This type of commencement an­
nouncement is v y attractive and 
in addition to its usual use, forms a 
means of keeping the names of the 
members of your class and a pro­
gram of the events of commencement

NITE ARTS CARTOON DANCE,
Well, we’re getting closer to the 
finish now. It will seem rather 
strange to have a lot o£ time on 
our hands during those long summer 
evenings. Although just at this writ­
ing, summer seems far, far away 
with the whistling of the March 
breeze in our ears. We notice a new 
tennis court down among, the daisies 
below the Engineering school. Prob­
ably getting ready for the summer 
"Racketeers.” Heard the gentle notes 
of the lute from the Arts Building 
the other night, (maybe it was a 
sax). Sounded like the "Last Chord," 
they have been hunting that for 
some time. All of which goes to 
prove that all is’ not drab that is 
technical.
By the way, what is that part of a 
wall directly behind the Art School? 
A fund should be started to com­
plete the building. Perhaps Henry 
Ford would buy it. Saw' an article -in 
the paper relative to the placing of 
a stop light at Morewoo I and Forbes. 
Just an “idle thought" (apologies) 
while climbing a pole to get ‘ out of 
the way of a modern Juggernaut 
(may have been a Fierce Sparro\v) 
at this place. Well Ivm going to quit 
—-see you again.
K.F.R.
A letter came to me recently 
which read, in part: . . After all,
there are old undying books which 
are just as interesting and, since] 
you seem to think that is what stu­
dents wish to read, just as "sexy” 
as any modern novr’ . . . Why, then, 
don’t you review some of those? To 
say the least the idea would be in­
teresting and novel. It would re­
new attention to the better books 
and give them, the students, a 
chance to get acquainted with 
books that some of- them have 
never even heard about—.” Now, 
that you’ve read that, read it again 
while I think awhile.
It’s a hard job, kids. This col-1 
umn is primarily a column for new! 
books regardless of their worth. 
Anyway, in retaliation, new books 
aren’t as bad as this reader seems 
to think. Time -out. Next week 
instead of the Book Review this 
column will contain a compilation 
of what these weary eyejs con­
sider the ten best books oflast 
year and the early part of this. 
What slavery to get that‘.review 
prepared! Many a weary mile have 
these old legs tottered through 
rain, sleet, snow’, aye, even through 
downtown traffic, tired armsxlutch- 
ing a precious bundle of books 
sometime among which was a gem 
to be added to the collection—- 
“Ten Best!" My feeble heart pal­
pitated to the (Hey, you! Wake 
up! Editor’s note.) Yes,' yes;: 
coming, Mr. McDonald, yezzir. 
Where was I? Oh, yes. Well, on­ward. ------------
Just to be flip, if the old books 
haVc only the recommendation that 
they are just as interesting why 
go back to the past for current 
reading? The reader himself makes 
the comparison “just as interest­
ing.” So, why not read the. new 
ones? Seriously though, I’m going 
to leave it up to the readers of 
this column. If there is to be a 
battle about old and new books— 
I hereby proclaim myself neutral 
and await further results.

Pinchot and Prohibition
Not only are Carnegie class elections in the immediate 
offing, but Pennsylvania’s political pot is brewing with increas- 
ing ferocity, comparable in every detail, but on a more imposing, 
if not more successful scale. With the primary battle little 
more than a month distant, Gifford Pinchot is waging a com­
mendable battle for the position he so ably filled from- 1922 to 
1926In a personal interview last Sunday, Pinchot painstakingly 
outlined the more sturdy planks in an admirable platform. On 
no. problem would he “hedge,” but stated his views with great 
sincerity. An enemy of the present system of coal and iron 
police, he believes wholeheartedly in the eighteenth amendment 
and intends to complete the good work he started in 1922 in 
the re-organization of the publi-c utilities and public service de­
partments. ‘It was evident that he deemed the problem of coal and 
iron police, as it is at present administered, a viscious mis­
carriage of law and order. Citing the excellent supervision 
prevalent during his regime, he, advocates several reformations. 
Coal and iron police should be trained by the state who would 
select capable candidates; companies desiring such employees 
would apply to Harrisburg for them, paying the State for their 
services, who would in turn pay the police. _ Under this plan, 
the present thugs and gunmen would be eliminated, the men 
would be better trained and would be totally under state juris­
diction. , r • 1 • 1As regards prohibition, Pinchot was equally firm in his be­
lief that the eighteenth amendment should be upheld as it is 
now stated in the statutes of our nation. Although he is power­
less to act on the issue, since it is a question of national scope, 
he becomes admirable in his stand. At no . time does he try to
straddle the fence in order to obtain votes.
•He proposes a better organized civil service, with definite ed­
ucational requirements necessary for certain positions. lie is 
a bitter enemy of the public utilities extortion which is at pres­
ent so prevalent. With his election, bus, electric, water, and 
other companies would be required to dro.p to their previous 
rates.Pinchot graduated from Yale in 1S89, and was the first 
American student to practice forestry as a profession._ Always 
a picturesque figure in national, as well as state politics, it is
exceedingly interesting to witness hi's present fight. lie may
npt succeed in scuttling the Vare-Grundy ship with Mellon at 
the helm, but it is a perfect setting to test which is the more 
powerful—the common people who have much to gain, or the 
powerful public utility and commercial combinations. L.
April Fool Supplement
Practically every college in the country devotes each year 
one .issue of their paper to blatant idiocity and gross untruths. 
With this, the April 1st supplement, the Carnegie Tartan follows 
suit after years of conservatism ¿nd staid journalism. Pages one 
and six are devoted to authentic news while the inside pages con­
tain nonsense touched with satire, a little truth, 3nd much that is 
exceedingly untrue. In no article is offense meant; it was written 
purely in fun and it is the earnest desire of the staff that it be 
taken, wholeheartedly .as such. Perhaps in some places good may be 
done,, as student opinion can-frequently be stated jokingly where 
it would be undesirable to treat it seriously. However, we, the 
editorial staff, hope that the campus will sympathize, excuse and 
possibly derive some amusement from our chronic attack of journal- 
itis. L.

ENVIOUS MAGGIE MURPHS

'¦result being that of a miniature 
Boy Scout pace!
Then they all lay down on the 
floor, in continuance of their “set- 
ling-up exercises,” looking—as they 
lay strctched out—like twenty-four 
indiscriminate little pollywogs, each 
with a movable pair of arms and 
legs attached. These appendages 
were continually being jiggled up 
and down by their respective own­
ers, and made to assume the most 
.amazing positions. Any refuter of 
Darwinism could be immediately 
converted by the sight of these 
prone bipeds; indeed, his conver­
sion might even go so far as to 
claim man’s relationship to the 
minute protozoan multitudes, rath­
er than their later tree-climbing 
descendant»! Here and there a dis­
turbing element in the form of a 
long, boney foot was wobbed dis­
mally about in direct variance with 
the indicated rhythm, and a deep 
masculine voice, attached to the 
opposite end of the framework 
holding the Disturbing Elements, 
muttered indistinguishable invec­
tives upon the sportive dance. At 
the scissors kick, one of the most 
difficult of its kind, the knockkneed 
one in the class was peerless in 
his amusing struggles to maintain 
perfect equilibrium. He, however, 
reversed his position, and was 
shining light when an exercise— 
somewhat like the inverted bicycle 
ride of Metropolitan Tower fame— 
was announced and rhythmically 
tom-tommed. One or two year's 
hence, perhaps, the displayer of 
these queer antics may be the John 
Barrymore of the Little Theater— 
the enunciator and disperser of 
Shakespearean blank verse. Were

The Yes”—“No” controversy 
rages here in all its fervor, the vio­
lence of ^ the assertions or denials 
varying in pitch all tlie way from 
a high B flat to a low-down F at 
the other end. The “Yes” group, 
bending low, sibilantly murmurs 
yes —unbending a little, “yes”— 
with still more insistence, the body 
bent at an obtuse angle, “YES.” 
And so on, ad infinitum, until the 
body is erect; the “YES” has risen 
Jrom a siihpl.e statement to a start­
ling yell of cheerleader propor­
tions, with the arms flung back 
for further emphasis. But they 
find their equals in the “No” group 
who confront them, liostilely de­
fiant, and meet their shout with a 
resounding battle cry, “NO-O-O.” 
J hen, retreating a few steps, they 
drooped visible, and the “No” fal­
tered and diminished 'in Vcflumc. 
This was repeated several, times’ 
intil the body was abjectly crouch­
ing on the floor, with only the 
slightest of negative responses, is­
suing forth . . . The whole purpose 
of course, is to balance the lower­
ing and raising of the voice in in­
tensity and volume, keeping it 
equalized in its ascents and de­
scents as much, as possible. The 
“no” coming down is-far more dif­
ficult, and, whereas the, second 
group liad seemed to be dominated 
h}' the first, in reality they had 
unconsciously dropped their voices 
more than a whole pitch, although 
still maintaining their belligerent 
attitude. All this provides excel­
lent training for future argumen­
tation, and many of the household 
disputes may hinge on, or be at­
tributed to the existence of sucli 
curythmics. Also, - anyone who 
dares accuse a. Dramat of tempera­
ment docs so unfairly. Who 
wouldn’t develop it after spending 
the greater part of an hour shout­
ing meaningless monosyllables to 
an opposing host in bathing suits?
At a commanding chord, they 
sprang into line again, each little 
pollywog. resolving itself into a hu­
man turnstile, sinuously revolving 
as it steps along—wonderful train­
ing for those who change their vo­
cation in favor of balancing trays 
of baked apples and scrambled 
eggs in Child’s! Then, to close the 
hour, they skip around again, dou­
ble-quick time, their bare feet pat­
tering on the smooth floor—for the 
most part being perfect specimens 
for advertising companies, Pepso- 
dent, Pep, and Ivory Soap 
That this sort of training develops 
poise is undoubtedly true, for we 
could see signs of it before our 
eye’s. But we are satisfied now, 
we know how the Dramats “got 
that way” and we sympathize most 
heartily, at the same time being 
just a bit envious that our aca­
demic course docs not soar to such 
aesthetic heights, taking us along with it!
Belieüe It Or Not!Thistledown Exposes Page From 
Absent-Minded Professor’s Diary
Monday. Forgot the number of 
the room, so failed to arrive in 
time for my eight-thirty class. I’m 
never sure whether it’s room 125, 
251, 215, etc. When I came home 
for breakfast at nine-thirty, discov­
ered I had missed another class
at that hour because I was con­
fusing Wednesday and Thursday.
Tuesday. Forgot to put on one 
of my socks when I dressed, which 
made my class of girls smile, in 
spite of the fact that they’re quite
used to me. Left the wrong bun­
dle at the Chinaman’s, so found 
myself trying to lecture, front my 
wife’s illegible laundry list.
Wednesday. Met the Dean on 
the Cut. He accused me of being 
that idiotic Thistledown. Said lie 
was sure Thistledown was me, be­
cause Thistledown had a habit of 
forgetting to be funny.
Thursday. Got to class ten min­
utes late, and found no one there. 
I didn’t care, but I hate to see 
such forgetfulness in the younger 
generation. Thought I had forgot­
ten to pay for my lunch at the 
Grill, and then remembered that 1 
had forgotten to cat lunch.
Friday. Had announced an exam, 
but forgot to make an examination, 
and then forgot to leave it to be 
mimeographed, and then forgot to 
bring it to class. Forget what else 
I forgot,
Saturday. Came to class feeling 
somewhat dumb, so intended to 
give the boys an adjourn. Forgot 
that a class which meets on Tues 
day and Thursday, twice a week, 
doesn’t meet three, times.
rimday. Very windy, day. Got 
out my Macchi-67 for a little flight 
but forgot, to land before I discov­
ered I was almost out of gas. 
That’s all.

With the advent of the Chicago 
Symphony, Monday night in its sec­
ond concert here this year, it seems 
only fitting and proper for this scribe 
to chronicle, in the absence of worth­
ier material, a concert by the same 
group, with* Jascha Heifetz, soloist, 
heard in Chicago, Friday afternoon, 
March 14.
Jascha Iieifetz, the remarkably 
gifted violin virtuoso, made his ap­
pearance as soloist after an absence 
of some seven years and strengthened 
the high opinion of Chicago^ music 
lovers and professionals, regarding- 
his transcendental artistic talents anti 
accomplishments. f
He chose the D major concerto 
for violin by Brahms for his ex­
hibition piece, and lie interpreted this 
r asterpicce of violin music and 
symphonic work with his well known 
flawless technical rendition, with 
characteristic tonal beauty and with 
refinement of art, and both as to 
accent and. musical style the per­
formance was one that might be 
recorded as one of the finest in the 
annals of violin music.
The program arranged by Frederick 
Stock included a symphony in C 
minor by Saint-Saëns. A composi­
tion, somewhat free in style and 
form, in two divisions, which had 
great melodic interest, which showed 
the composer as a musician of rc: 
source as to treatment of thematic 
material, and which also disclosed an 
orchestral palette in which many in­
struments were added to the regu­
lar symphonic ’orchestration. These 
included extra wood winds and 
brasses, three kettle drums, organ, 
piano (four hands), triangle, cym­
bals, bass drum, besides the regular 
strings.
The orchestra performed the sym­
phony with warm tonal colors and 
with several well placed sonorous 
climaxes, and Mr. Stock, at times, 
read into to score more musical sub­
stance than the themes indicated.
The orchestra performed also a 
new symphonic composition, “Grey 
Galloway” by John Blackwood ' Me- 
Ewen. (D’ y’ no’ ken ’tis a .bur-r-ry 
Scotch mon what wrote it?) .This 
work, captioned “A Border Ballad,” 
is a rousing good rhythmical piece in­
spired by Scottish atmosphere and 
tunes and proved a brilliant number. 
Richard Strauss’ “Serenade for Wind 
Instruments” opened the program in 
a novel manner, the eleven perform-: 
ers all disclosing their individual 
talents in this unusual instrumental 
work.
Witness the absence of any ex­
traneous actions, and any visible 
signs of emotion and feeling and 
admire Heifetz’ customary aloofness. 
He interpreted the three movements 
of the concerto in genuine virtuoso 
fashion and received the enthusiastic 
applause of t!.e audience. The 
orchestra, under the direction of Mr. 
Stock (the toast of the town), gave 
him a marvelously sympathetic and 
artistic accompaniment.

(Continued from Page Three) 
they filed in again, looking quite 
pleased with themselves—they had 
decided to object to all the budg­
ets they had received.
In the meantime, President Satig- 
stcr had proceeded. By listening 
carefully one could hear him dis­
tinctly in spite of the constant 
squeaking of the chairs. The chicf 
topic of discussion was Dr. Baker. 
Owing to the fact that he had 
disobeyed the parking rules, the 
Executive Committee had referred 
the matter to Council. Should Dr. 
Baker be retained as president, or 
had his actions so disgraced Car­
negie that his resignation should 
be requested? ,
Evidently the Dragons had met 
the night before because Ycrina 
and Ashwell exchanged glances, 
shook hands, and Jimmy rose tc: 
his feet and began:
Mr. Ashwell: I believe that un­
der the circumstances Mr. Baker's 
rcsignatnon should be requested. 
His actions have been decidedly 
detrimental to the good name of 
Carnegie. Besides, I don’t like the 
pictures in his office. ,
Mr. Miiyne: (Council's almost
silent, but influential member) : I
don't agree with you—“Doa" Bakci 
should be allowed to park his car 
anywhere—I like the color. H 
can put it all over the place—so 
long as it doesn't interfere with 
my mining.
Mr. Bunker: I think Dr. Baker
should resign. I don’t know just 
exactly why—but I object to tlv 
principle of the thing.
Mr. Ycrina: I agree with Mr.
Bunker and Mr. Ashwell. You 
see------
Miss. Morgan (interrupting): You 
men needn't think you can run 
things like this. Just because Mr. 
Ycrina was unable to get Council’s 
consent to be made president in 
place of Dr. Baker he thinks lie 
can get the Dragons to control 
this meeting. Doesn’t he realize that 
it’s against the policy of the Council?
Mr. Owens: Speaking from a fi­
nancial point of view, as chairman 
of the budget committee, I believe 
we should request—in fact, demand 
—Dr. Baker’s resignation. This 
year we have been trying to cut 
down expenses here on Council— 
that last request of Dr. Baker’s for 
50 cents more a month is too 
much.
Mr. Connelly: It’s true we must
cut down expenses, but the ex­
pense of breaking our contract 
with Mr. Baker would cost more— 
I refuse to sign any requisitions. 
I’ll not keep even the office hours 
I do now.
Mr. Sangster (in a weak voice- 
an unusual thing): Gentlemen!
Gentlemen! Do I hear a motion?
The Dragons, with one accord: 
“We move Dr. Baker resign.”
Mr. Sangster: All in favor-----
Mr. Ashwell (sweetly): Has the 
motion been seconded, Mr. Presi­
dent?
Mr. Sangster (stammering): Do 
I hear a second to the motion?
Dead Silence!
Mr. Becker (the silent Dragon 
partner): I second the motion.
Mr. Yerina (hurriedly): Question
Mr. Sangster: All in favor oi 
demanding Dr. Baker’s resignation 
give their consent in the usual 
manner.
All the Dragons except Dick 
Dcvcrell responded immediately 
Spcing his hesitation the other 
seven Dragons, including the impar­
tial president, fixed stern glassy 
eyes upon him. Dick, muttering 
something about disliking Doc, Ba­
ker's evening studs, hastily gave his vote.
The opposing vote was then 
called for—the ones who were stil 
awake hastily poked some of the

snore.
The meeting adjourned — the 
Dragons choosing swords and pis­
tols at fifty paces.
It was discovered later that the 
Faculty Executive Committee had 
decided to retain Dr. Baker in their 
meeting two hours before the 
Council met.
I sat beside each other last spring 
at a final examination in the Gym, 
in which unpleasant situation we 
suffered together for almost two 
hours, I thank you for all your 
civiljfics ever since, in recognizing 
me and speaking to me whenever 
you meet inc. But the other day 
you stopped to talk with me in the 
Park, when I was walking with the 
prettiest co-ed—at least so 1 think 
her—in Carnegie, She did not like 
your looks, and said she wondered 
what strange fellows I was ac­
quainted with. Dear Cardo, she 
might immediately reject my at­
tentions for those of that foppish 
dramat, Tom Ranlwcll, if she 
should suspect we were friends; 
therefore I earnestly beg you in 
the future to pay. no attention 
whatever to, Your appreciative 
reader, John Fearfemmc.
Dear Cardo: I am entirely con­
vinced of the truth of what you 
said to me- when you found me 
alone in my room the other night 
after the dance. You told me then 
of the silly way I was in, but you 
told me in such a way that I 
realized you like me, otherwise I 
should not be obeying your re­
quest to let you know my thought! 
so frankly as I do now. I know 
the co-ed on whom I am spending 
so much time and money, because 
of whom I am flunking my- courses, 
is all that you said of her; but the 
triflcr has something in .her so 
undcsigning and harmless, that her 
disastrous effect on me disappears 
in the light of her innocent inten­
tions. I keep the promise I made 
you in writing you the state of my 
mind after your kind warnings; 
and 1 will endeavor to get the bi t­
ter of the fondness that makes me 
so much her admirer, that 1 feel 
slightly ashamed to pretend myself 
yours, ,,T. D.

(Continued from Page Three) 
The most severely injured mem­
ber of the facllty was President 
Baker, who was hit over the head 
with a pint bottle by Frank Harri- 
erschlag, another student dry lead­
er. Baker was taken away by the 
.policc, and put cm the thirty-fifth 
story of the Cathedral of Learning, 
where lie will undoubtedly be safe 
for several years.
Both sides were resting today, 
until their leaders recover from 
their injuries. The student body 
in general is mobilizing forces,'pre­
paring for the next meeting, which 
is to be held tomorrow at the Beta 
T'-eta Pi house, where Koulter 
Ziegler will serve tea. Leaders 
of each side refused to commit 
themselves as to future action, and 
it is hard to tell just what the final 
result will he.

Old Man River roared down from the 
Nqrth ; ; ; washed away miles of puny 
man-made levees . . . turned a peaceful 
countryside into an inland sea. Down the 
angry swirling river in cockle-shell skiffs 
—up again in powerful government steam­
ers—hundreds of miles through desolate 
inundated areas went McGraw-Hill edi­
tors. Thousands of engineers and business 
men expected the facts and McGraw-Hill 
editors got them—first hand. Not the 
human-interest story of thrilling rescues 
and homeless tots but the deeper signifi­
cance of the river’s rampage on transporta­
tion, industry, buying power and business. 
Whatever the story . .. wherever it breaks 
... if it is'of interest to industry or business
you will find a McGraw-Hill editor cover­
ing it. In the recesses of scientific labora­
tories, in the inner offices of business, iu 
the outposts of the engineering world, you 
will find these men searching for facts, 
anticipating the trend of new develop­
