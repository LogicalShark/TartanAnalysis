Mr. Merchant, there are over two 
thousand students at Carnegie Tech 
who are spending money every day. 
Do they know who you are and what 
you have to sell? Are you talking 
with them through the advertising 
columns of The Tartan? Better make 
arrangements for space if you want 
your share of Tech money. If you 
want to “get in the game,” write to

PITTSBURG, PA., WEDNESDAY, JUNE 9, 1909TEN CENTS
COMMENCEMENT INFORMATION
Invitations and tickets for the Commencement 
Exercises will be given out on Wednesday, June 
9th, from 9 to 12 A. M., at Dean Leete’s Office, to 
Applied Science students, at Dean McGoodwin's of­
fice to Applied Design students, and at Dean Smith’s 
office for the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School. 
All Night Students and the Day Industrials will re­
ceive theirs by mail.
Members of the Senior Class will each receive five 
invitations and 10 tickets. Additional invitations 
may be secured at the rate of five cents each.
Each under class man, night or day, of the four 
schools will receive one invitation and two tickets. 
The two tickets may be given to parents or friends, 
as no tickets will be required of our students.
Students of the Schools of Applied Science, Ap­
plied Design and Apprentices and Journeymen are 
to assemble at the Schools at 9.45 o’clock Wednes­
day morning, June 16th, and march in procession to 
the hall, where seats will be reserved for them. In 
case of rain the march will be omitted, students to 
assemble in the basement of the Institute.
Students of the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School are to assemble in the Orchestra Rehearsal 
Room of the Institute at 10 o’clock promptly.
In order that all classes, night and day, may be 
fully represented on this important occasion, every 
student is expected to arrange to be present, if pos­
sible.
After the Commencement Exercises a luncheon 
will be served at the University Club for the Alumni,
Faculty and members of the Graduating Classes 
and parents. Tickets for the luncheon, at 75c each, 
may be secured at the store room up to 10 A. M. 
Wednesday, and at the box office of the Institute 
after the exercises.
COMMENCEMENT DAY SPEAKER.
The commencement day speaker, as - previously 
announced, will be Dr. Maclaurin, the newly in­
ducted President of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. There is a coincidence in the fact that 
Dr. Maclaurin follows Dr. Woodward as our com­
mencement speaker. Both of them left the chair of 
Mathematical Physics at Columbia to accept execu­
tive positions at the head of large institutions, Dr. 
Woodward the Presidency of the Carnegie Institu­
tion and Dr. Maclaurin that of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology.
Dr. Maclaurin was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, 
and spent his early boyhood in New Zealand. He 
returned to England to complete his preliminary 
education and entered the University of Cambridge 
in 1892. He took the degrees of Bachelor of Arts 
and Master of Arts at Cambridge, the former in 
1895 and the latter in 1896.
During the years 1896 and 1897 he spent ten 
months in the United States and Canada, devoting 
himself to study and to visiting educational insti­
tutions of all classes, spending much time at McGill, 
Toronto and Leland Stanford Universities.'

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
Returning to England at the end of his American 
trip, he re-entered Cambridge University, this time 
to study law, and was awarded the McMahon Law 
Studentship, the most highly valued of its kind in 
the university. He became a member, at this time, 
of the Honorable Society of Lincoln's Inn, London. 
During this period he spent six months, on a leave 
of absence, in studying in Genmany.
In 1S98 he was awarded the Yorke Prize by the 
University of Cambridge for his thesis on “The 
Title to Realty,” a difficult and important topic in 
British law. The thesis was published in English 
and French, and received world-wide comment from 
the highest legal authorities. Of it the Law Quar­
terly says, “It gives promise of a real school of legal 
history which may flourish and bear fruit, notwith­
standing the general apathy of the profession toward 
everything not of obvious utility in practice.” Pro­
fessor Maclaurin has, therefore, gained the two 
most coveted prizes of Cambridge University, in 
two absolutely different and distinct branches of 
learning—mathematics and law.
In 1898 he was appointed Professor of Mathemat­
ics in Wellington, where the University of New 
Zealand is located, and soon afterward became a 
trustee of the university. In this position he took 
an active part in the organization of technological 
education in the colony. In 1903 he was made Dean 
of the Faculty of Law in the University of New 
Zealand, which office he held for four years.
In the fall of 1907 he was invited to take the 
chair of Mathematical Physics in Columbia Univer­
sity in New York City, which had been previously 
occupied by Dr. Robert S. Woodward, now President 
of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. A year 
later he was placed in charge of the Department of 
Physics at Columbia University.
In 1898 the degree of Doctor of Science was con­
ferred upon Professor Maclaurin by Cambridge Uni­
versity, in recognition of his researches in pure 
science; and he was again honored, in 1904, by that 
university with the degree of Doctor of Laws, for 
his achievements in the study of law.
Professor Maclaurin has written, in addition to 
his theses, a large number of scientific papers of a 
high order dealing with various mathematical and 
physical topics. In a recent number of the Revue 
Scientifique he has an article on "Higher Technical 
Education in the United States,” in which the Mas­
sachusetts Institute of Technology is described as 
the typical American technological institution. 
Among other things he says in this article, “One
may well question the wisdom of the policy com­
mon in American colleges and universities of sep­
arating, or attempting to separate, “culture” from 
science and technology. The usual practice is to 
devote earliest part of a student’s life to so-called 
culture, and postpone his scientific and technical 
training to a later stage. This artificial arrange­
ment is thoroughly irrational; for, if any separation 
be really required, it would seem more reasonable 
first to train the young mind thoroughly in scien­
tific methods and leave the assimilation of real cul­
ture to a later period, when he has a broader out­
look and a ¡better knowledge of men and affairs.”
It will be seen from these statements that Pro­
fessor Maclaurin is familiar with the educational 
system of England, Germany, France, Australia, 
Canada, and the United States; that he has made 
a reputation for himself not only in scientific re­
search and teaching, but also in legal investigation; 
and that he has had much experience as an educa­
tional administrator. He is known by scientific 
men all over the world; and his associates in edu­
cational, scientific, and legal work in England, New 
Zealand, and New York concur in testifying to his 
high qualities as a man, a scholar, and an educator.

The Senior Household Arts Class visited the 
Home of the “57” last Wednesday morning. Miss 
Bradt and Miss Nickerson chaperoned the party. 
After registering in the reception room, we were 
taken in charge by an eloquent guide, who recited 
the history of the work from 1869 to the present 
day, ending by introducing us to each of the “57.” 
Another guide then took us through the spotless, 
up-to-date staibles, where the beautiful black horses 
live. Here everything is done by electricity from 
feeding to harnessing and currying. The horses 
are certainly more fortuate than most men, hav­
ing both a private Turkish bath and a roof garden 
connected with their residence.
We were next taken to the box factory and can 
making department, where everything is done by 
machinery. ¡But of course our interest centered in 
the kitchens whence came such delightful odors. 
Here were many hundreds of girls working quietly 
and swiftly, preparing, packing, and wrapping the 
various food products. Everything about these de­

partments was spotless and shining even to the 
floors. Surely there can be no cleaner spot in 
Pittsburg!
Perhaps the most impressing feature was the 
amount of thought and care exhibited for the health, 
comfort and happiness of the employees. ¡Locker 
and dressing rooms, a swimming pool, gymnasium, 
dining room, picture gallery, circulating library, roof 
garden, hospital and lecture hall all contribute to 
their welfare. There are pictures and mottoes and 
beautiful sentiments everywhere one turns.
After completing our tour of inspection we were 
taken to a dining room and served with—well, not 
all of the “57” varieties, but at least a dozen of them. 
Strange to say, no one had any appetite for lunch­
eon when we came away, and we all agreed to rec­
ommend and use only Heinz products hereafter.
Friday morning Assembly was a memorable oc­
casion, being the last day of school for the Seniors. 
The Plebes sang for us the songs they have been 
practicing with Miss Stoner, and in return we sang 
(or tried to sing) our “Farewell, Alma Mater.” 
Then everybody wept to the piano accompaniment.
The Household Arts division of the Senior Class 
will have a closing ceremony in the House, Monday, 
June 14th, at a quarter before two o’clock. All
members of the Faculty, Seniors and Juniors, are
invited to be present.
Miss Smith gave a tea Friday afternoon to the 
members of the Faculty and the Senior class. Every 
one had a delightful time but steadfastly refused 
to say farewell. No more farewells for us after the 
attempt of the morning!
Programs for the Senior Ball can be had at the 
office Thursday morning.
The Junior Class will entertain the graduating 
class at a tea in the gymnasium Saturday afternoon.
The Beta Phi’s were entertained last Saturday by
the C. H. K. There will be a tea this week at the
home of the C. D. H. A.
Friday afternoon the Dramatic Club presented a 
little play entitled “After the Game.” It came just at 
the right time, dispelling the sadness of the parting 
hour with genuine hearty laughter and enabling 
the Seniois to depart with smiles instead of tears. 
The girls looked very charming in their pretty 
gowns and played their parts well. The cast was 
as follows:
Nan ....................................................................Alta Beymer
Jack .........................................................Kitty McMullen
Bess .............................................................Elizabeth Kelly
Polly ..............................................................Nancy Herron

THE LAND OF REGRET.
Mountains, covered with dilapidated ruins, rose 
loftily on the le:ft. At their foot a little stream ran 
wailing and moaning down to the sea. As far as 
the eye could see on the left, was an extensive 
sandy plain, dotted with innumerable broken and 
jagged boulders. On one of these rocks sat a wrin­
kled old man sorting over some queer looking ob­
jects in a large brown sack. He was small and 
stooiped, with long gray hair and beard. Over his 
e'pare shoulders was hung a torn and tattered old 
cloak. Beside him on the sand lay a dull, rusty 
scythe.
Advancing toward this ancient man, I thus ad­
dressed him: “Pray, Father, what barren place is 
this and who art thou?”
Raising his venerable head, he gazed dreamily to­
ward the hills. “Yon hills,” he sighed mournfully, 
“are called the Heights of Ambition, covered with 
the ruins of the Air Castles of Youth. These plains," 
he said, pointing with his bony hand to the left, “are 
the Sands of Sorrow, weighed down by the Rocks 
of Remorse. And these,’’ indicating the objecs in 
the sack, “are Broken Hearts and Friendships, which
I mend and cast into yon Stream of Sorrow, to be 
carried down to the Sea of Forgetfulness.” Picking 
up his heavy burden and scythe, he turned away 
and sighed again, “I am Father Time.”

Miss Munson’s marriage tooji place yesterday.

The program for Senior Class Day contains a 
great number of clever original songs.
The registrar's office reports an unusually large 
entrance and examination list for the new Plebe 
class.
TECH NIGHT.
On June 15th, the Glee Club and the Pittsburg 
Festival Orchestra will hold a joint concert at Hotel 
Schenley lawn.. The numbers sung by the Glee 
Club will all be new and the grounds ought to be 
packed. This will be the last concert of the year 
and the schools should be largely represented. It 
is desired to make June the fifteenth a Tech Night 
for the students of the different schools to get to­
gether and liven things up. Everyone, therefore, 
who has any interest in the schools, turn out and
help make Tech Night a success. Come and let
people know that we are not asleep; come alone 
or bring your friends with you and let them go away 
with the impression that Tech is a good old school
after all. In short come and induce all your friends
to do the same. Tickets can be had at the store 
room or from any member of the Glee Club.

This week’s issue is the last one for the present 
editorial staff and the final issue of the year will 
come out next week under the direction of next 
year’s Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Nicols.
The past year has, we believe, been productive of 
more interest in the school paper than had been in 
evidence in either of the two former years of its 
existence. We take this opportunity of bespeaking 
for Mr. Nicols and his assistants still more help and 
interest than has been displayed so far. The work 
of conducting a school paper will be found to be of 
some benefit to the individual interested in it even if 
it is not so in a financial way. All underclassmen 
who are interested should endeavor to do some 
work toward making the school paper better. They 
may do so with the assurance that their work will 
be appreciated and also if it is good enough to war­
rant it, they may ultimately be one of the associate 
editors, at least, if not the position as Editor-in-Chief.
Everybody out for the Faculty base-ball game 
Friday afternoon! The annual affair will be pulled 
off next Friday and everybody, at least all who have 
enough credits to graduate should be out to see what 
happens.
On only one occasion has the school been able 
to make any showing against the Faculty and that 
was in the year when the team was composed of ex­
perts on every game but base-ball. This year the 
Senior class seems to have a little better material 
to pick from, but to date has not practiced very 
consistently. We all hope that in spite of this handi­
cap there will be something doing next Friday. Just 
think of the rooting possibilities if we could knock
Mr. Leete out of the box. Wagner’s glory would 
suffer in comparison with that of the man who could 
accomplish this feat. All come out and remembering 
the warnings you have received about cuts and the 
deferred grades handed in help to retaliate.
WHITE FRIARS’ DINNER.
The White Friars closed the season with a small 
and informal dinner and burlesque of this year's 
show Monday night. Commencing at a late hour, 
and coming at a time when many of the men were 
preparing for examinations, the attendance was not 
as large as was expected. The affair began at the 
Hotel Grand, and later adjourned to Piatt’s, where 
most of the burlesque was given by different mem­
bers of the company. It was announced that Eric- 
son, Brown, James, Fleming, Keally, and Oliver 
had been selected for undergraduate membership, 
to be voted in later.
§ PLEBE CLASS |

Pollock (in Spelling match)—Denial—d-e-n-a-i-1.
Prof. Knox—The sixth problem is getatable.
For Sunday excursions, see Dr. James.
Hittner (in class meeting)—It has been first and

Nechamkin (in debate)—You can go to some place

Every selection from “There was a pig in the par­

Silverman (speaking of course)—‘What are you

Osborne—A vacation.
Notice—Terrible accident in Physics Lab. Kaul 
swallowed some mercury. It is too bad that he 
could not obtain a stronger liquor.
Is it true that' the Plebes are holding all night 
sessions in Mr. Tombaugh’s apartments in the cel­
lar?
It is with great regret that we fomally announce 
the departure of Mr. Gamble from our midst. Mr. 
Gamble was immensely popular here, and the class 
has surely sustained a great loss.

R. T. Crane of Chicago, on account of his remarks

* The Seattle papers have a vivid account of the 
eleven-inning ball game played here between the 
Cubs and Pittsburgh. Some of the fellows who tried 
to stay to the finish and then eat, shave and inves­
tigate the shirt stud situation before the White 
Friars’ performance that evening, could probably 
supply a few details.

The papers of Seattle, Washington, of Sunday, the 
30th, tell of the eleven inning ball game President 
Taft attended'in Pittsburg. We guess that some of 
the fellows who attended the evening show given 
by the White Friars minus a shave can tell some­
thing about it, too.

Reports from Washington regarding the lengthy 
cruise recently completed by the United States 
steamer “Cheyenne," in which oil was used as fuel, 
are to the effect that the vessel was able to steam 
faster than with coal, and that her steaming radius 
of 1,500 miles, which was her limit when burning 
coal, has been increased by the use of oil to 2,300 
miles.
The Ambrose Channel entrance to New York har­
bor, which, when completed, will be 2,000 feet wide 
and 40 feet in depth, has now been excavated 
throughout its whole length for a width of 1,000 feet. 
It will take about two years and a half to finish the 
whole work. The completed portion has shown none 
of that tendency to silt up which was predicted, and 
it seems likely that the scouring action of the tides 
will serve to keep the channel permanently clear of 
shoals.

that the company have now equipped the most impor­
tant division of their road, between Blue Island and 
Rock Island, consisting of 165 miles of double track, 
with dispatchers’ telephones.

the Portland Architectural Club were returned last 
week. The Archaeology problem, “A Design for a 
Bishop’s Tomb,” by Markley, was photographed, and 
reproduced in the catalog.
IN REGARD TO THE TEST FENCE.
A great many who have noticed the number of 
panels removed from the test fence have assumed 
that all the samples removed had failed in the test, 
This is not entirely so as of the forty or fifty sam­
ples removed only about ten have failed to with­
stand the test so far. The first panels used were 
of three varieties, white pine, yellow pine and 
spruce. It has been decided to discontinue the use 
of any but white pine panels. When the panels 
were removed they were examined by committees 
representative of the Scientific section of the 
Paint Manufacturers’ Association and of the Carnegie 
Technical schools and those failing were removed 
while the others will be replaced to undergo further 
tests.

An informal farewell banquet is to be given at 
Michigan in honor of ex-President Angell. Prepara­
tions are being made for 1,300 guests.
The system of building embankments, by running 
trains of loaded cars on rails hung from a' suspen­
sion cable above the line of the embankment, is being 
used with great success, notably on a long and high 
embankment on the Lake Hopatcong cut-off of the 
Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railway. Two 
cables are strung from a fixed tb a movable tower, 
and suspenders from the cables are attached to the 
floor beams of a portable track, which is carried 
forward ahead of the completed embankment a suf­
ficient distance to allow a train of dump cars to be 
run upon it and emptied through it. The new 
method is more speedy and costs less than the old 
system of building a trestle and burying it in the 
embankment.
The auxiliary survey yacht “Carnegie,” which is 
being built at the Tebo Yacht Company’s yard, South 
Brooklyn, is making good progress. The hull is in 
frame, the deck beams in place, and about one-half of 
the ceiling and planking is done. It is expected that 
the launching will take place during the last week in 
May, and that the yacht will be completed about the 
Fourth of July. Immediately after her trial trip she 
will start for Hudson’s Bay, and commence to make 
a series of magnetic observations along the proposed 
route of a new steamship line from Churchill to 
Liverpool. In the autumn, after her return to this 
city, her bottom will be sheathed with yellow metal, 
and she will then be ready for her cruise in southern 
waters in 1910. The yacht is 155% feet in length 
over all, and is built of strictly non-magnetic ma­
terials.
