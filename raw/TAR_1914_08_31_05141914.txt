The announcement of the changes 
and new plans for next year, and of 
the arrangements for this year’s pic­
nic and commencement were made by 
Director Hamerschlag at the Mass 
Meeting of all the students of the four 
schools on Thursday, May 7, in the 
Design School Theatre.
Like the week before, the hall was 
packed to the limit, so that a number 
of M. M. C. S. girls led by Miss Ston­
er took places on the stage with the 
Director.
The change of the school hours from 
9:00-5:00 to 8:30-4:30 was announced 
for next year. Its purpose is to give 
the students a longer time for recrea­
tion in the afternoon. This change 
of time, and also the arrangements to 
have by next year a student restaurant 
which shall be only self sustaining and 
not profit-making, was made at the 
solicitation of Professor Edmund Es- 
querre, head of the Department of 
Student Health.
One of the features of the new res­
taurant, which is to be on one floor of 
the new central building now going 
up, will be the division of the students 
into classes according to weight, for 
the purpose of proper dieting. The 
management will be controlled by the 
food experts in the faculty of the 
schools, and a special effort will be 
made to have the girls of M. ÎL C. S. 
and Design patronize the restaurant.
The commencement functions this 
year are to be the most elaborate ever 
held here. Everything will take place 
between Friday, June 12th, and Tues­
day, June 16th, inclusive. The sched­
ule follows:
Friday, June 12th—Classes end. 
Saturday, June 13th—Alumni and Sen­
ior Banquets and other Alumni func­
tions.
Sunday, June 14th — Baccalaureate 
Sermon in Design Theatre.
Monday A. M., June 15th-—Baseball 
and other games.
Monday P. M., June 15th—Open Air 
Festival or Pageant with Supper on 
the Campus, followed by Lantern 
Light Band Concert.
Tuesday A. M., June 16th—Parade of 
Alumni, Faculty and Students until 
Commencement at 10:00 A. M.— 
Carnegie Music Hall.
Tuesday Afternoon, June 16th—Rest. 
Tuesday Night, June 16th — Com­
mencement Dance.

On a field covered with mud, Carne­
gie clearly demonstrated its superior­
ity over Westminster in track last 
Saturday afternoon by winning the 
annual dual meet by the rather one­
sided score of 81 tr 45. Considering 
the condition of the groands, seveial 
of the races were run in good time, 
but no new marks could be made. 
Again it remained for a visitor to be 
the individual star. G. Vincent of 
Westminster carried oft* the honor 
with two first in the shot put and dis­
cus throw, a second in the hammer 
throw and a third in the broad jump, 
for a total of fourteen points. Al­
though no Tech man is credited with 
as large a score, Hemmann, Clair, and 
Campbell were bunched together with 
counts of ten, nine, and eight in the 
order named.
The Plaid representatives present­
ed several new faces. Kirk was fin­
ally persuaded to forego baseball to 
compete on the cinder path. In his 
initial appearance, he demonstrated 
his ability by taking second places in 
the hundred-yard dash and pole vault. 
x\fter a year’s absence from the team 
ex-captain Criswell of the bssket-ball 
five, signalized his return by tieing 
for first place with Carson of West­
minster in the high jump. Blumen- 
thal, a senior of the Industry School, 
and Meredith, the former Central 
High School runner, were tried out 
in the hurdles. Blumenthal made the 
better showing by scoring in both 
events, while Meredith’s chance in 
each race were unfortunately de­
stroyed when he stumbled. Marks 
ran for the first time this season, and 
exhibited good form in winning sec­
ond place in the 220-yard, and third 
place in the 100-yard dash. Kuhman, 
a Plebe was third in the 220-yard 
dash.
Tech won nine of the fourteen 
events and failed to place in only one, 
while Westminster was whitewashed 
in five. Coach Dull’s distance run­
ners and sprinters furnished the most 
consistent work. The former display­
ed lots of spirit and planned to run 
so that each would secure the requir­
ed number of points for a letter. Has- 
elton ran the best race of the aftei- 
noon in the half-mile, winning in the 
fast time of 2:08 2-5. Finlay gave a 
good account of himself by following 
Haselton to the tape. Dunseith plow­
ed through the mud to an easy vic­
tory in the quarter mile. Patterson, 
who finished third, was nosed out at
DR. BRASHEAfi 
LECTURES ON (OLOR
the finish. In the field events, the 
points were evenlr divided between 
the two schools. Clair -won the ham­
mer throw, but could gain only sec­
ond place in the discus and third in 
the shot. Adams showed marked im­
provement with the hammer, and made 
the second best toss with the shot. 
Westminster had no entries in the 
pole vault, permitting Wright, Kirk, 
and Vierheller to divide the points 
in the order named.
After waiting a. year to break thfc 
tie with Central Hish School which 
resulted from the last Carnegie in­
terscholastic track meet, Greensburg 
High School outclassed its old rival 
and led the field in Saturday’s events, 
winning the cup for the team 
prize. Central High’s showing was 
on the other hand disappointing. Lev­
inson its old stand-by was its only 
hope, and he kept his school in the 
running by scoring 10 of the 13 points 
credited to it. Greensburg’s victory 
was hard fought and well earned. 
Monongahela, McKeesport and Se- 
wickley each scored three firsts to 
two for the winners, but the latter 
was fortunate in obtaining more sec­
ond places. Peabody had the record 
of placing in the largest number of 
events, counting in 8 out of 13. 
Greensburg won the meet with 23 
points, McKeesport was second with 
20, Sewickley third with 18; Monon­
gahela, fourth with 17; Peabody, fifth 
with 14; Central, sixth with 13; Shady- 
side, seventh with 12; Wilkinsburg, 
eighth with 10; Allegheny and Cleve­
land tied for ninth with 7; and South 
tenth with 2 points.
Wolf, of McKeesport High School, 
carried off the individual honors by 
winning the two hurdle races and tak­
ing third in the discus throw, scoring 
in all 12 points. He was followed by 
Hill, of Monongahela, and Levinson, 
of Central, both of whom made 10 
points. The Monongahela runner, 
however, was, in the opinion of the 
Tartan reporter, the best of the prep 
school contestants. He won the half 
mile in 5:15 and then the mile in 4:55- 
1-5, a time better than that made by 
the college men. This latter feature 
was repeated several times. Wolf, of 
McKeesport, ran both hurdle races 
faster than the Westminster and Car­
negie hurdlers, w'hile Deman, of 
Greensburg covered the quarter mile 
4-5 of a second quicker than the col­
legiate runners. The one-mile relay

ADDRESSES STUDENTS IN 
DESIGN THEATRE.
Dr. John A. Brashear, gave a most 
interesting and instructive lecture to 
the students of Carnegie last Thurs­
day afternoon in the Design Theatre. 
He was assisted by Prof. Harry S. 
Hower of the Science School.
“Uncle John” was introduced by
H. B. Pearce, president of the Tech 
Studio Club, under whose auspices the 
lecture was held. Mr. Brashear ex­
pressed his appreciation of the stu­
dents in their desire to have him lec­
ture to them1 on this interesting sub­
ject. He told of his experience and 
interest in the school from the time it 
“was in embryo” till the present. He 
is one of the three left who served on 
the original committee of the Insti­
tute of Technology. The other two 
being Mr. McConway and Mr. Schwab. 
Below is given a brief synopsis of the 
lecture.
Dr. Brashear expressed his regret 
that artists did not know more about 
the reasons and results for color and 
color effects. Several instances in 
which artists had painted from nature 
and failed to carry color impressions, 
all through the lack of knowledge up­
on color; were related by him. He 
insisted and proved that color did not 
exist outside the eye. He explained 
fully the effect of the different light 
rays upon the retina and translation 
to the brain.
The spectrum was thrown upon the 
screen, told the causes of the different 
colors and that there existed in that 
spectrum about two million tints. 
“Uncle John” explained in an intense­
ly interesting fashion the superiority 
of the weaker sex in selection tints 
and color values. The results of the 
strains in glass, both harmful and un­
harmful in lens, were shown. He is 
now polishing in his laboratory in 
this city one of the most perfect pieces 
of glass in the world.
The difference between pigment 
colors and colors due to refraction 
were shown by reference to nature. 
Mr. Brashear exhibited a plate of high­
ly polished silver on which about one 
hundred thousand groves had been cut 
with a diamond. The refraction of 
light and color was beautiful. The 
laboratory in Pittsburgh has made 
three such plates in the past twenty- 
five years, the one shown being one 
although imperfect. They are used in 
astronomy to analyze the various gases

COMMENCEMENT DANCE.
As was announced at the mass 
meeting last week, the Council has 
decided to hold a Commencement 
Dance this year on the night of the 
16th of June. Owing to a certain am­
biguity in the remarks of the Direc­
tor, most of the students interpreted 
his meaning to be that this dance 
would be open to all students at the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology. 
However, this was not the impres­
sion that he wished to give, the Coun­
cil having decided that this dance 
should be limited to graduates of the 
four schools, alumni and faculty. The 
Monday afternoon festivities, in 
which there is to be a competition 
for a special banner, on the other 
hand, is open to under-classmen from 
all the schools.
The purpose of this Commence­
ment Dance is to bring the graduat­
ing classes of the four schools to­
gether on one of the few occasions 
where they have the opportunity to 
meet socially. It is hoped thereby 
to have a large function, one which 
can be made impressive enough to 
truly represent the standing of the 
Institute.
SENIOR BALL.
But the question comes up as to 
whether this Commencement Dance 
ought to supersede the Annual Senior 
Ball given by the Seniors of the 
Schools of Applied Design and Sci­
ence. In the past, this Senior Ball 
has not been open to Seniors in the 
Industries School, solely, we believe, 
for the reason that there exists a dif­
ference in aims and an inequal­
ity in scholastic standing be­
tween the men in that school 
on the one hand, and the men 
in the Science and Design Schools 
on the other hand. No one can deny 
that this scholastic inequality still ex­
ists, and for that reason we hold that 
the Senior Ball, given by men who 
will graduate with degrees of Bache­
lor of Arts and Bachelor of Science, 
should not be open to Seniors from 
the Industries School.
It has been argued, and quite truly, 
that heretofore the Senior Ball has 
not been a remarkable success. This 
was due, mainly, to financial reasons. 
But this year the Design School, 
which is available for the Commence­
ment Dance above mentioned, would 
without doubt be available for the 
Senior Ball. Thus the financial dif­
ficulty would be greatly lessened, and 
with this trouble solved, there seems 
to us no apparent reason why the af­
fair should not be decidedly success­
ful.
The occasions on which the De­
sign and Science Schools are brought 
together are entirely too few. We 
believe that there should be a strong 
bond of fellowship between the stu­
dents in these two schools, due to 
their common scholastic aims, and we 
heartily welcome all functions which 
will tend to unite these schools.
THE 1914 THISTLE.
The Junior Class and the Thistle 
Board are to be congratulated upon 
the recent appearance of the 1914 
Thistle, in many ways a most inter­
esting and meritorious year-book.
However,—and we do not say this 
in the way of condemnation, but 
merely as a frank statement of our 
opinion and as a suggestion for next 
year’s Board—there were a great 
many more errors, typographical, 
grammatical, and rhetorical, than 
should be present in a college year­
book. More than any other school 
publication, the year-book should set 
a standard of excellence along these 
lines.
The trouble this year seems to have 
been due to hasty proofing. In mak­
ing this statement, we are reminded 
somewhat of those well-known glass- 
domiciled people. However, the sys­
tem used by The Tartan in its en­
deavor to furnish the latest possible 
news to the student body, limits the 
time available for proof-reading, and 
errors unavoidably creep in; whereas 
in the case of The Thistle there is a 
great deal more time available for 
this part of the work.
For next year’s Board we might 
make a few suggestions which may 
or may not be valuable. In the first 
place, so many different class his­
tories become a little monotonous in 
the reading. Perhaps this difficulty 
can be solved by the new Board. The 
Grinds could be made decidedly more 
interesting. There are any number 
of laughable incidents which occur 
around the schools that never get into 
the Thistle. And this, by the way, 
is not a reflection on the Boards so 
much as it is one on the students, who 
feel so little interest in their year­
book that the Grind Boxes are al­
most invariably empty when the 
Thistle editor comes around to open 
them. It is to be hoped that the stu­
dents as a body will take more inter­
est in the publications next year. 
Above all, we hope that the new 
Board will prevent unnecessary and 
displeasing typographical and gram­
matical errors. It will only require a 
little more time and attention to make 
the year-book, in so far as it repre­
sents what we might term the liter­
ary tone of the students, a book to 
be proud of, rather than something to 
be explained.
COST OF ATHLETICS.
The report of the National Colle­
giate Athletic Association, which 
deals with the cost of athletics in 
American colleges, has recently been 
issued. The report shows that the 
150 institutions represented in the as­
sociation spend $2,000,000 annually on 
athletics and that 90 per cent of this 
amount is spent on the Varsity teams.
Harvard heads the list with $160,000 
per year spent on its Varsity teams, 
with an individual cost of $400 per 
man; Cornell follows with an expend­
iture of $75,000; Wisconsin, $45,000; 
Minnesota, $30,000; California, $35,- 
000; and Columbia only $15,000. This 
last figure is accounted for by the 
fact that Columbia does not put out 
a football team and also indicates 
that football is the largest item in 
the annual budget.
The recent report has again called 
forth criticism1 of college athletics on 
the score that they benefit only the 
select few who win places on the 
Varsity teams. The report further 
strengthens this position by pointing 
out that only one-tenth of the total 
expenditure is for those branches of 
athletics, such as tennis, gymnasium, 
etc., which are participated in by a 
large portion of the student body. All 
efforts, it is argued, are expended on 
the physical development of the 
picked few and the rest of the col­
lege must shift for itself.
But, isn’t this the wrong point of 
view? Colleges are not established 
to develop the physical man and 
should not concern itself about each 
man’s daily exercise. The exercise 
that each student thinks necessary 
for his welfare should be taken at 
his own initiative. To be sure, the 
college should provide facilities for 
this and it does provide gymnasiums, 
courts, links and the like. By the 
nature of things these are maintained 
at a lower cost than is a football 
team. And thus the student body 
can be provided with first-class means 
of exercise at a great deal smaller 
cost than can similar football or base­
ball training be acquired.
But if this is the case, it is said, 
why have Varsity teams at all? The 
answer to this is found in the fact 
that there is no other force in college 
affairs which is so apt to create a 
spirit of loyalty and devotion to the 
institution as a lively interest in in­
tercollegiate athletics. And this is a 
spirit necessary to the welfare of the 
college.—College Topics (University

FRATERNITIES COMPLETE 
THEIR RUSHING RULES.
The Following is an Account of the 
Rushing Rules Adopted at the 
University of Texas.
The work of revising the freshman 
rushing rules was concluded by the 
Interfraternity Council after a two 
days’ session. The principal changes 
made were to prohibit a freshman 
from visiting a fraternity house or a 
fraternity man’s room, and to pro­
hibit a fraternity man from visiting 
a freshman’s room, except under cer­
tain named conditions, and to compel 
all fraternity men now rooming with 
freshmen to change their rooming 
places within the next ten days.
Infringements Condemned. 
Pan-Hellenic also adopted a reso­
lution condemning the action of any 
fraternity that breaks any of the rules 
passed.
The rules passed are as follows:
An amendment to the rule forbid­
ding fraternity men from rooming 
with freshmen:
From this date no fraternity man 
shall move into the same room with 
a freshman, and any fraternity man 
now rooming with a man ineligible 
under the existing faculty rules shall 
move within ten days, unless the fra­
ternity shall pledge itself not to bid 
that man. These rules shall not ap­
ply to brothers of active men in chap­
ters.
No fraternity man may visit a 
freshman’s rooms, even where both 
are in the same rooming house.
No fraternity man shall allow a 
freshman to come to his room, ex­
cept where both fraternity and non­
fraternity men are rooming in the 
same house; then only may he visit 
provided no other brother of the fra­
ternity man is present, except those 
rooming in said house.
No fraternity man shall permit a 
freshman to come upon its premises, 
except at the time provided for in the 
rushing rules.
The term “freshman” shall include 
all men ineligible under the existing 
faculty rules.
All other rules are in force except 
as in conflict with this.
The rules and amendments passed 
at the first day’s session are as fol­
lows:
The changes and additions to the 
existing rules were as follows:
Article 1 of Rule 1, under the title 
“Rushing” shall be construed to 
mean:
“That it is a violation of these rules 
for any fraternity man, or group of 
men in the name of the fraternity, to 
accompany, regardless of the person on 
whom the expense falls, or whether 
there be any expense, any non-frater- 
nity man who is not eligible to mem­
bership in a fraternity under the ex­
isting rules of the faculty, to dinners, 
lunches, picnics, dances or to the the­
atre, or on automobile or buggy rides.
“But it shall be within the meaning 
of these rules that it is permissible 
for fraternity men to accompany a 
non-fraternity man not eligible to
membership in a fraternity under the 
existing faculty rules to athletic con­
tests only, provided that said non­
fraternity man pays his own expense 
and only his own expense to such en­
tertainment; but it shall be permitted 
that a fraternity man may pay for 
picture shows, car fare and soft 
drinks.
Penalty.
All past offenses are wiped out, and 
it shall be the duty of the Pan-Hellenic 
Council to investigate all cases of al­
leged violations of the above rules, 
and in case a fraternity shall be con­
victed of a violation, that fraternity 
shall not be allowed to bid, pledge or 
initiate the freshman concerning 
whom the violation occurs; and, in 
addition, the name of such fraternity, 
the specific charge upon which it was 
convicted—not to include the fresh­
man’s name—and the nature of the 
penalty shall be made public through 
the columns of The Daily Texan, and 
a copy thereof be sent to the freshman 
concerned.
It shall be a defense to a prose­
cution for a violation of these rules 
if the fraternity concerned can show 
to the satisfaction of the Pan-Hellenic 
Council that the entertainment alleged 
to be in violation was entirely dissas- 
sociated with any activity of the fra­
ternity or others in its interest.
It shall also be considered a, com­
plete defense if the fraternity con­
cerned will bind itself never to bid 
the non-fraternity man involved.
Limitation shall be a defense nine­
ty days after the offense.
All present rules are in full force, 
except as changed by the above con­
struction and amendments.
Resolutions.
The resolution condemning the ac­
tion of any fraternity that breaks any 
of these rules reads as follows: 
Whereas, rumors have come to the 
notice of the Interfraternity Council 
of alleged violations of the Pan-Hel­
lenic rules governing rushing; and, 
Whereas, violation of the rushing 
rules is not only unfair to the fresh­
men involved and the other fraterni­
ties interested, but is in violation of a 
solemn conpact among the fraterni­
ties, but, whereas, sufficient evidence 
has not been produced to justify the 
conviction of any specific fraternity, 
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Interfraternity 
Council strongly condemns any fra­
ternity that has been violating any of 
said rules, and hereby puts the stamp 
of its disapproval upon such viola* 
tion, and in the future will strictly en­
force all of said rules.
Be it further
Resolved, That this attitude be 
give the widest publicity practicable, 
both in the columns of the Daily 
Texan and by individual circulation.

In the Center of the Iroquois Block
A lecture of a very practical nature 
was given to the Students of the 
School of Applied Industries by Mr. 
Phyllis of the National Tube Co. The 
title of the lecture was, “From Iron 
Ore to Finished Pipe.” It was illus­
trated with a few reels of motion pic­
tures which showed every process 
through which 'the ore had to go be­
fore it becomes finished pipe.
Before the lecture a short business 
session was held at which it was de­
cided to give up the idea of having 
a minstrel show for the benefit of the 
club room1 and to hold a musical con­
cert and dance instead. The Club 
Room Committee was appointed to 
arrange the affair and to report at the 
next meeting. It was also decided that 
the present mail box in the lower hall 
of the Industries School was a men­
ace rather than a benefit and Presi­
dent Price appointed J. H. Clark and

PHYSICAL TRAINING DEMON­
STRATION.
The students of M. M. C. S. and 
of the Dramatic Department of the 
Design School, gave their annual 
physical training exhibition in the 
gymnasium of M. M. C. S., Tuesday 
and Wednesday nights, May 5th and 
6th.
The program1 was opened by the 
Sophomore Class in "Swedish Days 
Order, followed by the Plebes in 
three exercises. First, heavy exer­
cises on bar and ropes. Second, Re­
lay, over box, and last, seven jumps, 
a Norwegian Folk Dance.
A number of dances were then giv­
en, the first an Aesthetic Dance by 
the Sophomore Class, next the Dance 
of the Flowers by the Misses Knapp, 
Harbison, Pond and Bowman. This 
was followed by the Swedish Weav­
ing Dance, given by the Plebe Class, 
also My Lady Cullen and Hunsden 
House, English F"olk Dances.
The students of the Dramatic 
School then gave Tarantella which 
was followed by the Sophomores 
demonstrating the Harlequin Dance 
and the students of the Night School 
in a Dutch Dance.
The “Humoresque” a Greek Dance, 
was next on the program', at the com­
pletion of which Miss Helen Harbi­
son gave an Egyptian Dance that had 
been arranged by Miss Stoner.
Miss Stoner and Miss Eastman 
then danced the “Neopolitan Taran­
tella.”
The men of the Dramatic School 
then gave Flamborough, an English 
Folk Dance.
The program was completed by a 
Basket Ball game. On Tuesday even­
ing the Plebes and Juniors played, 
ending with the score 2-1 in favor of 
the Plebes. The winners played the 
Sophomore team on Wednesday and 
lost by the same score.
Great credit should be given to 
Miss Stoner and Miss Eastman, 
through whose efforts such a polished 
program was possible.
M. M. C. S. DRAMATIC CLUB. 
PRESENTS “THE FAR­
AWAY PRINCESS.” 
GLEE CLUB GIVES 
CONCERT.
The Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School Dramatic Club presented on 
Friday evening, May 8, 1914, “The 
Far-Away Princess” and a Concert by 
the Glee Club, in the Design School 
Theatre.
The Concert, which was given first, 
consisted of the Glee Club rendering, 
“Roses Everywhere, Miss Anna O. 
Bromley then sang “Laddie,” The 
Musical Club then sang “O Lovely 
Night” by J. Offenbach and “Dixie’s 
Land” by Dan D. Emmet.
The next number on the program 
was “Summer Wind” which was sung 
by Miss Mary L. Williams.
A quartette composed of Misses
Millicent Leech, Ethel Fey, Leonora 
Henecker, and Anna H. Bromley 
sang “Annie Laurie.”
The final number was composed of 
“Ashes of Roses” and “Drink to me 
only with Thine Eyes” in which the 
whole Glee Club participated.
The Glee Club has been far this 
year under the direction of Mr. Mc­
Dowell and all praise should be given 
to him for the splendid work of the 
Glee Club.
The play followed the concert and 
started by Miss Lena Williams sing­
ing, Victor Herbert’s “The Princess 
of Far Away.”
The story opens in an inn situated 
above a watering place in central Ger­
many. It is a comedy which is group­
ed around the action of The Princess 
Van Geldan, Frank Van Halldorf 
and a student Fritz Strubel. All of 
which characters were remarkably 
well portrayed.
The Cast consisted of:

KARPARETOFF SPEAKS TO 
ELECTRICALS.
Karapetoff, Professor of Electrical 
Engineering for the last eight years 
at Cornell, and author of several text 
books on electrical engineering, spoke 
to the Electrical Engineering stu­
dents in Room 11, Machinery Hall, on 
last Tuesday at 11:00 A. M. The hall 
was filled to hear the speaker, who, 
though a Russian by birth, has a 
wonderful command of English. His 
subject was “Some Simple Transient 
Phenomena.” He said in part: “Any 
sudden change in the load of a trans­
mission line gives rise to Transient 
Phenomena. Breakdowns and fail­
ures of apparatus are most often due 
to transients.
“It isn’t possible in one however, 
to enumerate the transient phenom­
ena which have been treated in our 
literature, but what is of interest to 
us is that one stationary condition of 
load changes to another through a 
transient, of transition change. 
Broadly speaking, transient phenom­
ena are caused by the change of one 
form of energy into another, the 
stored energy in a circuit is changed 
increased or put back into the gener­
ator and the rate of dissipation of 
heat is changed.
“The danger in transients lies in 
the stored energy which may give out 
too rapidly and damage the insula­
tion. You get a transient in its most 
dangerous form' in a circuit with in­
ductance, capacity and the inevitable 
resistance.

“Take the short circuit in alternat­
ors; that’s an interesting study, if you 
don’t have to pay the bill. Then there 
is the study of transformers; and also 
the transient term in the revolving 
magnetic field.
“In all kinds of electric phenomena 
in transmission lines; the propagation 
of waves as in wireless, the question 
of impulse, for instance, a discharge 
of lightning, the study of discharges 
where the insulation of a cable is 
damaged, and finally all kinds of rec­
tification phenomena are transients. 
Those of you who wish to go into 
the matter will find enough to keep 
you busy for several days and per­
haps more.
“The engineer who just knows 
what an apparatus does is not the 
best kind. The leader in his profes­
sion wants to predict what will hap­
pen before it does, and then say, ‘I 
told you so.’
“Dr. Steinmetz wrote a great book 
on transients without differential 
equations, after engineers could not 
understand his first work. This book 
was a failure, because it was harder 
to read than the other. He would say 
‘Evidently this leads to the final re­
sult; and the word evidently or self- 
evidently didn’t help to understand it. 
Suppose you were asked to write a 
book on alternating currents without 
trigonometry. Wouldn’t it be better 
to teach simple trigonometry first, 
and then have the reader understand 
it?
“Thirty years ago an electrical en­
gineer knew little about trigonome­
try, but it was all direct current then. 
It was a luxury to know the difference 
between sine and cosine. There was 
no need for it then. But now you 
will need differential equations for aL 
ternating currents in the coming 
years. Learn how to integrate ones 
of not over the second order. Then 
you can solve a great number of en­
gineering problems.”
WHAT’S IN A NAME.
In the register of students for the 
present year, recently issued, are many 
names that may be applied in the Eng­
lish language to other than the indi­
viduals wearing them. A punster 
could work many a combination from 
the list with little strain on originality. 
The statistician would first be curious 
to count the number of our common 
surnames.
We find that the famous family of 
Smith is represented in the Institute 
by 28 members, leading all the com-
GOOD
CLOTHESCHEAPER
Clothiers, Tailors,
Hatters, Furnishers
504-506 Federal Street, N. S.
mon families that we know so well. 
Millers come next with 26 representa­
tives, beating out the Joneses by six. 
Wilson is another popular cognomen, 
being repeated 15 times.
Leading the oddities is the name 
Andrew Carnegie as a Plebe in the 
school which his namesake founded. 
Another peculiar fact is that there is a 
Cain enrolled in the same class with 
an Abel. Nationalities are well repre­
sented with an English, a French, a 
Welch and several Scotts. Then a 
variety of occupations is presented 
with a Gardner, a Baker, Tanner, 
Cooper, Weaver, Cook, Sadler, Mason 
and Mercer. Also, we have a Dean, 
a King, a Noble, a Knight, and a 
Bishop; a Fisher and a Hunter; and 
a Gaylord.
There are several plain Woods, be­
sides Ashe, Oakes, Beech, and Holly. 
With them go a Trunk, Moss, Stone, 
Budd and Bush. Summer and Winters 
are represented, as well as Fogg and 
Frost. There is a Hill and Hills, a 
Field, a Marsh, and Towns.
Animals there are galore, with Wolf, 
Fox, Buck, Hare, and a Bull. Savage 
may be put in the same list.
Of course, the usual colors are there, 
with Black, White, Brown, Gray, and 
Green. Other qualities are expressed 
by Little, Long, Wise, Harsh, and 
Holy.
First names are numerous, being 
John, Henry, Roy, Thomas, James, 
Otto, Karl and Harry.
It is seldom that a Work and a 
Shirk are together, but there are also 
a Se,i and a Hoard. Other oddities 
are a North and a West, a Carr and a 
Barrow, a Shaver, a Poorman, a Hood, 
a Finger, a Stein, a Moon, a Walker, 
and a Trotter, and a Minor.

CARNEGIE VERSUS PITT IN 
TRACK DUAL MEET TO­
MORROW AFTERNOON.
Carnegie and Pitt will resume rela­
tions in track tomorrow afternoon at 
3:30 o’clock on Schenley Oval After 
an interim of two years, the wearers 
of the Plaid will meet the Blue and 
Gold adherents in a dual conflict, the 
first of its kind since 1909. Going 
back in history, it is found that three 
dual meets have been held between the 
rival institutions. Beginning in 1907, 
Pitt was victorious two consecutive 
times, while Tech won the third con­
test. The result of tomorrow’s meet 
will, therefore, either even up matters 
or give Pitt the advantage.
Tech’s chances are rather doubtful, 
according to the “dope.” Our oppon­
ents’s advantage in the sprints will be 
balanced by our supremacy in the dis­
tance races. Unless the goddess of 
fortune in the habit of a professor will 
smile upon King, he will be ineligible 
and from present indications our 
chances in the hurdles are as rosy as 
King’s opportunity to compete. Pitt 
will likely place first and second in the 
broad jump; while the high jump will 
be nearly even. With King, Tech 
would be assured of this event. Pitt 
has the shade in the pole vault, but 
we should get second and third places. 
The weight events promise to be close 
and upon them, the result of the meet 
may depend.
At any rate, an exciting struggle is 
certain. So few opportunities are af­
forded the students to witness the 
track men in action, that they should 
make a special effort to go to the oval 
in a body, if possible, tomorrow after­
noon. The team this year is a good 
one, and deserves and needs student 
encuragement.
THE ALVIN.
The large attendance with which the 
Aborn English Grand Opera Com­
pany began its season at the Alvin 
Theatre, has not only continued, but 
has increased. The stay of the Aborn 
forces at the Alvin is sure to be a 
greater success than either of their 
two former engagements there.
The eight performances of the third 
week, beginning next Monday night, 
May 18th, will be given to Gounod’s 
masterpiece, “Faust” one of the most 
inspiring and richly melodious works 
of the entire grand opera list. With 
it is a beautiful story, taken from the 
Marguerite episode of Goethe’s great 
drama of “Faust,” its many pictorial 
possibilities, and its wonderful score 
including much immortal gems as the 
Flower Song, the Calf of Gold, Val­
entine’s ode to his sister, the Jewel 
Song, Faust’s solo and his dust with 
Marguerite in the Garden scene, the 
splendid Soldiers’ Chorus, the Ker- 
messe, the Trison Trio, the Holy
Angles and others. “Faust” is ever
one of the most admired of operas
of all times and countries.

Picnic, and Other Announcements
Continued from Page 1
The definite arrangements for this 
series of events wiTl be taken care of 
by a committee of twelve, equally 
divided among students, faculty and 
wives of faculty members. Thursday 
afternoon at her home, Mrs. Hamer- 
schlag, as temporary chairman, or­
ganized this committee, which con­
sists of Mesdames J. H. Leete, Ed­
mund Esquerre, H. A. Calderwood, 
Ralph Holmes, from the wives of the 
faculty; Miss M. E. Belleville, Pro­
fessors W. E. Mott, Harold Geoghe- 
gan, C. C. Leeds of the faculty; and 
of the students, Miss Estelle S. Broad- 
head, M. M. C. S.; A. H. McGill, A. S.;
G. A. Ebeling, A. D., and Philip H. 
More, A. I. This committee has au­
thority to prepare a plan for these 
commencement functions, and the sum 
of two hundred dollars exclusive of 
that realized from the sale of com­
mencement dance tickets has been set 
aside for their use.
Director Hamerschlag himself of­
fers a banner to the class or organi­
zation, exclusive of Seniors, giving the 
best showing in some dramatic event, 
pageant, or the like on Monday after­
noon of Commencement Week.
The picnic is scheduled for Wednes­
day, May 20, at Camp Louise Car­
negie. All classes will be suspended 
in the afternoon and a private train 
will leave Shadyside for Glencairn at 
1:30 P. M. Students may buy at the 
schools a round trip ticket from 
Shadyside for fifty cents, which means 
that the Institute pays the difference 
between this and the regular fare, 
about eighty cents. Supper is to be 
brought along and after it is eaten 
Mr. McCulloch will give a perform­
ance with his all-star circus.
THE GRAND
May Festival Week at the Grand 
Opera House and the last but one of 
the current vaudeville season begins 
on Monday afternoon, May 18. Mr. 
Harry Davis is planning to make this 
an occasion that will long be remem­
bered and one which will send the 
standard of refined vaudeville to an 
even higher plane than it has attain­
ed in the past at this justly popular 
place of divertisement. Vernal gar­
lands will bedeck the theatre, trans­
forming foyers and lobbies into the 
atmosphere of the conservatory.
It is interesting to note that among 
these attractions Mr. Davis has se­
cured John Hyams and Leila McIn­
tyre in “The Quakeress,” a one-act 
musical comedy written by William 
Collier, and Herbert Hall Winslow. 
Mr. Hyman and Miss McIntyre have 
but recently returned from their star­
ring tour in the musical comedy, “The 
Girl of My Dreams,” and also “When 
the Boys Are Away.”
The eleven other attractions which 
will comprise the completed bill will 
be chiefly acts that have never be­
fore been offered on the stage at the 
Grand. No detailed announcement is 
yet forthcoming, but in a few days the 
entire roster of the bill will be an­
nounced.
Dr. Brashear Lectures on Color
Continued from Page 1 
surrounding the planets.
“Uncle John” recommended the soap 
bubble as an inducer of sleep. His ex­
periments certainly proved his recom­
mendation. The beauty in soap bub­
bles and effects on them by colored 
lights were astonishing. Dr. Brashear 
it may be noted is an expert in the 
art of blowing them.
Sunsets were explained as well as 
variations in colors due to the cancella­
tion of different light rays by the dust 
particles which grow thicker in the at­
mosphere as it approaches the earth. 
A very difficult experiment was per­
formed by Prof. Hower, showing a 
representation of the setting sun, by 
chemical reaction and light.
Color photography was illustrated 
and examples thrown upon the screen. 
Some wonderful slides of natural 
flowers placed between glass were 
shown. These slides were prepared 
by Mr. Heeren of Pittsburgh and this 
was the first time they were shown in 
public. Complimentary colors were 
explained and illustrated by means of 
slides. Color effects by passing an 
electric current through colored glass 
and various gases was also shown.
Dr. Brashear saved the most inter­
esting and astounding experiment un­
til the last. He produced a light from 
which the color rays were absent and 
showed the result if such light existed 
at all times. The flowers and' flags 
upon the stage lost their color and 
were turned black; everything lost its 
beauty and charm.
In closing Dr. Brashear said in part, 
“The world may be just as you have 
seen it if you do not take the light 
and love of your life and scatter it 
abroad to your fellowman. Take what 
you have into your work, making re­
sults better. You may not be a per­
son like Mr. Carnegie,” he continued, 
“but you can make the world sweeter 
by living in it.”
The appreciation of the students 
cannot be expressed for Dr. Brashear 
and his lecture, which yielded such 
great results and inspirations to those 
present. The theatre was filled to its 
capacity. The stage was tastefully 
arranged and decorated by flowers. 
This is the first of a series of lectures 
to be given by the Tech Studio Club.
The old system of using a heated 
iron and dirty cloth presses the grime 
and dirt into your garments. Our 
sanitary machine steams it all out, and

CARNEGIE LOSES TO GROVE 
CITY.
Lack of hitting ability sent the 
Plaid nine to defeat again to the tune 
of 7-0, played by Grove City on the 
latter’s field, Saturday, May 9. Glenn 
allowed but three hits which were 
well distributed, and walked but one 
man, so that chances for scoring were 
worse than slim for Tech. Frye 
walked two men in his two innings 
of pitching, and allowed three hits in 
the second, one of which was a home 
run by Thorn who drove in three 
men before him. Ryan finished the 
game, striking out five men, and al­
lowing six hits which resulted in 
three more runs for Grove City.

Worse Than a Blow.
Sometimes one can hurt another’s 
feelings worse by a slight action than 
by any number of words. There is an 
example of this in the young married 
woman who went home to her mother 
and sobbingly declared she just 
couldn’t be happy with her husband 
again.
“I wouldn’t have minded it so much, 
mother,” she sobbed, “if Charlie had 
answered me back when I scolded 
him, bu—bu—but he did something 
worse!” t
Her mother was duly shocked at 
this.
“Mercy, my dear child,” she ex­
claimed. “He struck you, then?”
“No, worse than that mother!” and 
the young wife sobbed afresh.
“Tell me at once!” indignantly de­
manded her mother.
“He—he just yawned.”

DRAFTSMAN CLUB BANQUET.
The fifth annual banquet of the 
Night Draftsman Club, School of Ap­
plied Industries, was held at the Mo- 
nongahela Hotel on Thursday even­
ing, May 7th. The attendance was 
small, but this was more than made up 
by the excellent spirit displayed. The 
speakers were Dean Connelley and F. 
J. Hartman, R. F. Crom, ’13, acted 
as toastmaster. The officers of the 
organization are W. E. iNoble, presi­
dent; A. J. Glynn, vice president; J. L. 
Mooney, secretary, and Herbert Mc­
Kee, treasurer. Among the members 
present were Messrs. Schulte, Linhart, 
Papp, Hoffman, Byrne, Linaman, Eck- 
man, Kenny, Wall, and Watkins.
SPEAKS AT MOTHER’S DAY 
MEETING.
Dean Connelley was one of the 
speakers at the Mother’s Day celebra­
tion held on Sunday afternoon, May 
10th, at Memorial Hall under the au­
spices of the Allegheny County Moth­
er’s Pension League. He showed the 
advantage to be gained by sending 
children to the public schools rather 
than to orphanages and urged the en­
dorsement of the Mother’s Pension 
plan as a means of holding more chil­
dren in the public schools. The Dean 
is a trustee of the Pension League.
Andrew D. White, ex-president of 
Cornell University, said in regard to 
cigaret smoking: “I never knew a
student to smoke cigarets who did 
not disappoint expectations, or to use 
our expressive vernacular, “kinder 
peter out.” I have watched this class 
of men for thirty years, and cannot 
recall an exception to this rule. Cig­
aret smoking seems not only to weak­
en the young man’s body, but to un­
dermine his will and to weaken his 
ambition. In colleges having a large 
percentage of these futile personages 
they too often give the student tone; 
they set the fashion, the fashion of 
over-expenditure of carelessness as to 
the real aim of glory of college life.” 
—The Cornell Sun, January 13, 1914.

“Watt-hour you doing there?” asked 
the boss.
“Eatin’ currents,” replied the ap­
prentice shamefacedly. “Anode you’d

“Wire you insulate this morning, 
anyway?” demanded the boy’s boss.
“Leyden bed.”
“Wouldn’t that jar you! Can’t your 
relashunts get you up mornings?”
“Amperently not.”
“Fuse going to do that every day

BASEBALL GAME THIS AFTER­
NOON.
Carnegie Nine To Play Muskingum.
This afternoon at 3:30 o’clock, the 
Muskingum College nine will cross 
bats with the Varsity on Tech Field. 
At this early stage of the season, little 
has been learned about our opponents. 
The showing of the Plaid team has 
not been up to the standard of its nat­
ural ability. Taken individually, each 
player is capable of successfully hold­
ing down his present position. A lit­
tle more team work, hitting ability and 
confidence are needed to smoothen 
the rough spots in the machinery and 
to put it in good working condition.
Two games are scheduled for this 
week. In addition to the one today, 
another will be played Saturday with 
Allegheny at Meadville. Tech was 
victorious in both contests against the 
Alleghenians last season and hopes to 
land another victory over them. Hines 
and Urquhart who have done practi­
cally no work at all this year, are the 
probable selections for mound duty in 
the games this afternoon and Satur­
day.
Most of the classes will be over be­
fore game time, and, therefore, a large 
crowd of students should be in the 
stands. Unless you must hurry home 
to study tomorrow’s lessons, your ex­
cuse for absence will be a poor one.
CARTOONISTS TAKE AN 
INSPECTION TRIP.
The Cartoonists Club of the Design 
School were taken upon an inspection 
trip through the plant of the Chronicle 
Telegraph and Gazette Times last 
Wednesday night, May 6th. Mr. 
Charles J. Taylor accompanied them. 
They were shown through the entire 
plant, explained the process of mak­
ing cuts, from the time the picture 
left the artist or the photograph was 
finished until it was finished as a cut. 
Wm. Nees, a former student of De­
sign School, now with the newspapers, 
acted as guide to the party. This in­
spection is the first of a series of such 
to be made in the near future.
Some Soot.
The sootfall in the famous city of 
Pittsburgh varies from 595 to 1950 
tons per square mile per annum. If 
ground up with oil this would afford 
enough black paint to give a double 
coat of from 17 to 57 square miles of 
surface. Figure out for yourself the 
value of the conservation of resources 
if this paint were to be redeemed and 
also the number of B.t.u.’s going to 
waste annually.—The Tech.
The Cost of Athletics.
Surprising as it may seen, statistics 
show that during the last ten months 
of 1913 and the first two or more 
months of 1914 one billion dollars were 
used to further athletics in American 
colleges.

as usual, proved the most exciting 
race. Greensburg won this event 
mainly through the efforts of its an­
chor man. Monongahela was leading 
at the end of the third quarter due to 
a remarkable sprint by its little star, 
Hill. But Deman, the lanky Greens­
burg youth, was not to be denied, and 
deserves credit for running two such 
splendid quarter miles in one after­
noon.
Taken as a whole, the meet was the 
most successful ever held under Tech’s 
auspices, the weather alone marred 
the performances and caused the 
small attendance. The track manage­
ment is to be praised for handling the 
meet in so satisfactory a manner.

Section B of the Science Plebes 
have a crack team. That is under­
stood when they defeated the Soph. 
Electricals last Monday afternoon at 
3:00 p. m., Northumberland field, to 
the tune of 7-3.
The “stonewall” electrical infield 
put up their customary good game, 
but their sluggers were helpless be­
fore Darlington, who had 14 strike 
outs. The Plebes hit when hits were 
needed, and ran the bases well.
This Plebe team is perhaps the first 
to represent their class. They will 
play the Pitt Freshmen, and Fifth 
Avenue High. The latter game is 
next Monday afternoon, probably at 
Northumberland field, one square up 
Forbes from Wroodlawn.

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi­
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom' 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re­
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.

EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS.
The exhibition of Hungarian, Bo­
hemian, and Austrian graphic arts 
now in progress at the Carnegie In­
stitute is one of the most interesting 
of the many graphic arts exhibitions 
held under the auspices of the De­
partment of Fine Arts. There are 
368 numbers in the collection com­
prising a variety of media-etching, 
lithography, pen and ink drawings, 
aquatints, water color, woodcut, and 
a process closely allied to woodcut 
termed linoleum cut.
Among the notable artists in the 
Hungarian section are: Mariska Au­
gustin; Bardosz, who displays a keen 
sense of humor in his “Disputation”; 
Fejervary, who has several porcelain 
decorations redolent of Bakst; Sando 
Nagy, one of the founders of the So­
ciety of Hungarian Graphic Arts; 
Jules Pascin, who is represented by 
work decidedly individual in concep­
tion; and Josef Rippl-Ronai, a versa­
tile and skillful artist. Ronai’s work 
is given considerable prominence in 
Mr. Martin Birnbaum’s introduction 
to the catalogue.
Jettmar and Klemm of the Bohem­
ian section are well-known to Ameri­
cans by reason of reproductions of 
their works in Die Kunst fur Alle and 
Die Graphischen Kunst. Orlik is a 
cosmopolite in his choice of subjects. 
He is familiar with almost every cor­
ner of Europe and is now planning a 
trip to America. Bromse, appeals by 
his weird visions of death which are 
fascinating in their horror. Svabin- 
sky’s work has been received favora­
bly by all the critics.
The Austrian section contains the 
large etching “Joachin Quartet” by 
Schmutzer. This plate is fully 48x33 
inches. Oscar Laske depicts the 
movement of crowds with extraordi­
nary skill in his “Noah’s Ark.” To 
those who like the safe and sane in 
art, the six charming etchings of Wil­
helm Unger’s will appeal. While the 
curious will, no doubt, be satisfied by 
the modern tendencies of Melzer and 
Kokoschka.
This exhibition, on the whole, 
should appeal to students from1 its so­
cial as well as artistic standpoint; for 
the artistic work of these countries 
reflects the aesthetic feelings of the 
people. This exhibition will be in­
stalled in the Department of Fine 
Arts on the second floor, in Gallery 
H—better known as the Hall of 
Bronzes, until June first.
JUNIOR METALLURGISTS 
SWIMMING PARTY.
Tuesday afternoon, May 5th, and 
again Tuesday afternoon, May 12th, 
the Junior Metallurgists and their 
friends held a most successful aquatic 
play in the Oakland Nat. Under the 
leadership of C. T. Patterson, a spe­
cial course in swimming has been 
started, and any friend of the Junior 
Metallurgists may receive lessons by 
taking Tuesday afternoon off and 
joining this class.
CONFERENCE OF STUDENT 
EDITORS AT UNIVERSITY 
OF PITTSBURGH.
The Friday afternoon session was 
given over to general discussions 
opened by the editors of the college 
and high school papers of the Mid­
dle Atlantic Association. In the ab­
sence of a representative from Juniata 
College, Mr. Baerd, Secretary of the 
Alumni Association of the University 
of Pittsburgh, gave a talk on gather­
ing Alumni news. Mr. Williams, head 
of the School of Journalism, at the 
University of Pittsburgh, and Dr. 
Bleyer, Director of the Department 
of Journalism at Wisconsin, gave 
many valuable suggestions.
On Saturday morning, a meeting 
was held for general discussions of 
business questions relating to college 
papers.
The value of a college education 
and the practical experience gained 
on college publications were dis­
cussed by the Student Editors’ Con­
ference at the University of Pitts­
burgh last night. E. J. Stackpole, of 
the Harrisburg Telegraph, and Dr. 
Willard G. Bleyer, of the Department 
of Journalism of the University of 
Wisconsin, were the principal speak­
ers.
The nose for news and adaptibility 
to the work, which Mr. Stackpole 
called the inherent qualities of the 
successful newspaper worker are of 
paramount importance and without 
them the university training will avail 
little, he said.
Among other things, Mr. Stackpole 
said:
“In our day it is becoming more and 
more apparent that the newspaper is 
the light that is penetrating the dark­
ness of superstition and ignorance, 
and next to the Bible is proving the 
greatest factor in promoting the hap­
piness and general welfare of the peo­
ple. It is diffusing knowledge in all 
the walks of life and none is so poor 
as to be outside the pale of its béné­
ficient influence.”
That college papers when properly 
conducted furnish excellent prelimin­
ary training for newspaper work was 
pointed out by Dr. Bleyer.
“Methods of obtaining and handling 
advertising can be learned by the col­
lege student interested in the busi­
ness side of newspaper making if col­
lege papers are conducted in a busi­
ness-like manner,” he said.
COMMENCEMENT DANCES
