Obama, Romney throw down in presidential debate

With Election Day less than 
a month away, candidates are 
making a hard push to sway 
voters and inform constituents 
of their plat-
forms. 
Presi-
dent 
Barack 
Obama 
and his 
Republi-
can chal-
lenger, 
former Massachusetts Gov-
ernor Mitt Romney, verbally 
sparred at Colorado’s Den-
ver University for the ?rst 
2012 Presidential Debate on 
Wednesday. Jim Lehrer, a 
journalist from PBS, moder-
ated. A massive number of 
Americans viewed the debate; 
according to Nielsen ratings, 
over 67 million people nation-
wide tuned in.
Meanwhile, about 1,500 
miles away, Carnegie Mel-
lon students ?ocked 
to McConomy 
Auditorium to watch. Al-
though concerns like student 
loans were not discussed, 
the candidates nevertheless 
delved into various pressing 
issues facing the nation.
Romney 
came into 
the de-
bate with 
lower ex-
pectations 
from viewers. 
Trailing in most 
swing states, ac-
cording to vari-
ous polls, Romney 
was not favored to be 
a stronger debater than 
Obama; a CNN/ORC poll 
showed that 59 percent of 
likely voters felt Obama would 
have the stronger debate, 
compared to just 34 percent 
for Romney. However, he sur-
prised many with a strong, ag-
gressive, and determined per-
formance that kept Obama on 
the defensive.
Regarding the economy, 
Romney assured middle-class 
voters that he would reduce 
tax rates for them without in-
creasing the de?cit or decreas-
ing tax rates for the wealthy. 
In a comical moment, Romney 
remarked — in front of Lehrer 
— “I’m sorry, Jim, I’m going 
to stop the subsidy to PBS. I’m 
going to stop other things. I 
like PBS, I love Big Bird.”
Romney also repeatedly 
denied the President’s claim 
that he had a $5 trillion tax cut 
in his plan. Obama responded 
by accusing his challenger of 
suddenly changing his mind, 
saying that “now, ?ve weeks 
before the election, [Rom-
ney’s] plan is ‘never mind.’ ”
Romney said that he plans 
on repealing Dodd-Frank, a 
bill signed into law in 2010, 
because he feels it is negative-
ly impacting mortgages and 
small banks while unfairly fa-
voring certain groups as being 
“too big to fail.”
His plan to repeal Obam-
acare — a law signed in 2010 
to overhaul the American 
health system — was also 
made clear. Regarding both 
plans, Romney said that he 
would repeal the previous 
laws and replace them with 
other statutes that would re-
tain the positive aspects of 
Dodd-Frank and Obamacare.
After hearing his challeng-
er’s proclamations, Obama 
responded by questioning 
Romney on his lack of details 
about which parts of the bills 
he wished to keep or replace. 
Obama also questioned why 
he would want Obamacare to 
be repealed, considering the 
fact that it was written using 
the health care plan Romney 
signed into law while gover-
nor of Massachusetts. 
Romney responded to this 
oft-repeated criticism 
by saying that while 
the Massachusetts 
health care plan 
made sense in a 
state situation, it 
should not be a 
federal law that 
applies to ev-
ery state in 
the nation; 
he reasoned 
that health 
care should be 
determined on a 
state-by-state basis.
The two candidates did 
both agree about education 
needing to be excellent; how-
ever, this did not stop either 
from throwing barbs. Obama 
frequently stated that while

Since 1950, the Alumni As-
sociation has organized the 
annual Alumni Awards cer-
emony to honor the contribu-
tions of distinguished gradu-
ates, faculty, and students. 
Approximately 300 people at-
tended this year’s ceremony, 
held on Friday in Rangos Hall.
Vice President for Univer-
sity Advancement, Alumni 
Relations, and Annual Giving 
Andy Shaindlin; Alumni Asso-
ciation President Antoinette 
Ungaretti; and University 
President Jared Cohon intro-
duced the honorees and spoke 
brie?y about the alumni asso-
ciation and awards ceremony.
“This event is something I 
look forward to every year,” 
Cohon said. “It’s the one mo-
ment each year when we 
pause to celebrate all our 
alumni and what the alumni 
mean to this institution. These 
are remarkable people.”
The ?rst awards were Stu-
dent Service Awards, given 
to Meg Hayes (HSS ’11, HNZ 
’12) and current senior policy 
and management and statis-
tics double major Sonia Siok. 
This award recognizes current 
students’ service to the uni-
versity community and sur-
rounding Pittsburgh commu-
nity. Siok is a mentor through 
her position of house council 
president and her member-
ship in Amnesty International 
and Student Government.
“Seeing these students 
grow and learn has been and 
will continue to be one of the 
greatest rewards of my stu-
dent service,” Siok said.
The Honorary Award was 
given to Dean of University 
Libraries Gloriana St. Clair. 
This award is rarely given out 
and recognizes the honoree’s 
unwavering support to the 
university, student body, and 
community.
St. Clair was named an 
Honorary Alumna for her 
work with the Million Book 
Project, Carnegie Mellon’s 
Osher Lifelong Learning Insti-
tute, and more.
“The quality of instruction 
here over the last 14 years has 
been awesome,” St. Clair said. 
“I’ve learned so much from 
my colleagues and students. 
I learned to think globally, 
use duct tape, and be tough. I 
learned to inspire others, cre-
ate change, be ready to reposi-
tion, tell your story, and that 
olives aren’t just for martinis.”
Recent Alumni Awards 
were given to Sam Franklin 
(HNZ ’07) and Jordan Ja-
mieson Green (CIT ’03). This 
award recognizes profession-
al accomplishment or service 
to the university by those who 
have graduated within the 
last 10 years. 
Green is an assistant pro-
fessor of biomedical engineer-
ing at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity and a co-founder of Johns 
Hopkins’ Translational Tissue 
Engineering Center. 
“Carnegie Mellon built 
such a strong foundation on 
the professional and personal 
side,” Green remarked. “I met 
my future wife in Calc 3-D. I 
can’t imagine where I would 
be in my life without Carnegie 
Mellon.”

General Stanley McChrys-
tal, four-star general of the 
U.S. Army and former com-
mander of U.S. and interna-
tional forces in Afghanistan, 
focused on relationships in 
terms of achieving strategic 
objectives during his lecture 
at Carnegie Mellon last Fri-
day.
McChrystal presented to 
an audience of around 400 
Carnegie Mellon students, 
faculty, parents, and alumni 
in McConomy Auditorium.
By taking a philosophical 
approach toward strategic is-
sues, McChrystal employed 
both military and personal 
examples during his presen-
tation as a means of offering 
applicable advice to his audi-
ence.
He pointed out that, dur-
ing war, military generals 
tend to lose sight of relation-
ships while focusing on cer-
tain strategic military objec-
tives.
“In Afghanistan, what I 
think we did to a great de-
gree was try to drive around 
the people,” McChrystal said. 
“We tried to focus on the en-
emy, focus on the Taliban, fo-
cus on Al Qaeda. [However], 
if we ignore the relationships 
with the people at individual, 
organizational, or national 
levels, [we] miss the point.”
“Relationships are the 
strategic intermediate objec-
tive. They are not a byproduct 
of getting something done; 
they are a way to get some-
thing done,” he added.
McChrystal applied his 
experience seeking and main-
taining relationships to the 
battle?eld, explaining that 
relationships with civilians 
played a crucial role during 
his tenure as a general.
“Relationships were not 
between me and the soldiers 
that I had grown up with; I 
needed relationships with 
kids, females, bearded elders 
who had a different culture 
— and I had to build real rela-
tionships, not just super?cial 
transactional [ones],” he said.
McChrystal believes that 
focusing on relationships 
with civilians during war can 
keep ethical groundings in 
check.
Concerning the inevitable 
deaths of civilians during 
war, McChrystal said, “I think 
that ethics are more impor-
tant during war than [dur-
ing] any other time because 
you have things going on that 
put people at risk, and so your 
own ethical foundation needs 
to be extraordinarily strong. 
People do get hurt in war, 
and unfortunately, a lot of the 
time it’s civilians — but what 
we can never do is let loose of 
our ethical moorings.”
The general added that 
listening is the key factor to 
sound relationships.
“If you never listen, you’ll 
be surprised, [because peo-
ple] stop talking to you and 
you don’t know why,” he said. 
“It’s extraordinarily impor-
tant to have a relationship 
and listen, whether you agree 
with them or not. It’s better to 
have a relationship that you 
disagree with so that you’ll 
have something to fall back 
on when complications oc-
cur.”
Shifting gears to cite a per-
sonal anecdote, McChrystal 
referenced his relationship 
with his son to show how 
building bonds helped to 
achieve his goal.
Despite his son’s rebellious 
haircut choices and lack of 
educational drive, McChrys-
tal said that during his son’s 
high school and college years, 
he tried to focus on their rela-
tionship instead of their dis-
agreements.
“We maintained this close 
relationship because I ?gured 
that with time, he would turn 
out all right at some point, 
which is of course what hap-
pened,” he said.
McChrystal’s son is cur-
rently a counter-terrorist ana-
lyst. “If we had broken the 
relationship earlier at some 
point, I don’t think any of 
that would have happened,” 
McChrystal said. “[The rela-
tionship] is the essential en-
abler.”
McChrystal also pushed 
the importance of relation-
ships on a larger scale, using 
the fall of America’s GDP and 
the subsequent decline in U.S. 
global economic prevalence 
as an example. 
He explained that this 
downfall should not be a hin-
drance, but rather a reminder 
that it is becoming increas-
ingly more important to build

Lecture Preview
Anthony Wasserman, a 
professor of software man-
agement practice at Carn-
egie Mellon’s Silicon Valley 
campus, has been awarded 
the Distinguished Educator 
Award from the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics En-
gineers (IEEE).
Wasserman — who is a 
fellow of the Association of 
Computing Machinery, a life 
fellow of the IEEE, and a di-
rector of the Open Source Ini-
tiative — has spent time both 
in academia and industry. He 
served as the founder and 
CEO of Interactive Develop-
ment Environments, and led 
engineering for a dot com 
start-up company in the ’90s.
“I’m very pleased to re-
ceive this award because it’s 
always an honor to be rec-
ognized by one’s peers. It’s 
particularly rewarding to 
see innovative course and 
curriculum ideas widely ad-
opted. I’m very proud of the 
programs I have helped to de-
velop here at CMU,” Wasser-
man said in a university press 
release.
“Teaching graduate stu-
dents requires staying cur-
rent on rapidly changing 
software technology and 
identifying what topics will 
be valuable to them in their 
long careers,” he said. “My 
courses change every time I 
teach them.”

Carnegie Mellon comput-
er scientists and library staff, 
led by Dean of University Li-
braries, Gloriana St. Clair, 
have received a grant from 
the Institute of Museum and 
Library Services to develop 
Olive, an archiving system for 
the preservation of execut-
able content.
The project was endorsed 
by U.S. Representative Mike 
Doyle (D-Pa.), who wrote, as 
quoted in a university press 
release, “[Olive] seeks to 
address a pressing and ever-
growing need to preserve and 
maintain, through a revolu-
tionary new type of archival 
system, executable content in 
its original form.”
“Preserving these schol-
arly products of computer 
science research and making 
them accessible for future 
researchers has tremendous 
relevance for ensuring the 
accurate and reliable history 
of intellectual property to re-
solve issues of licensing and 
security constraints. For this 
reason, I believe the project 
will yield important bene?ts 
for government and indus-
try,” he added.
The ?rst content that Ol-
ive will preserve includes  
test cases such as deprecated 
and hardware-intensive gam-
ing software, executable aca-
demic research articles, and 
educational software such as 
the 1994 Great American His-
tory Machine.

During World War I, Amer-
ica held 46 percent of the 
world’s gross domestic prod-
uct. According to McChrystal, 
by 2030, that percentage of 
U.S. GDP will have sunk to 
22.8 percent. He said that this 
regression “doesn’t mean that 
we won’t be a great country 
anymore, it just means that 
we won’t be the only impor-
tant country anymore.”
“Instead of one world 
leader, we now have groups 
of world leaders of which we 
must be credible and legiti-
mate members,” he said.
McChrystal highlighted 
empathy and self-discipline 
as traits that display good 
command. He said, “If you 
can’t put yourself in some-
body else’s position, it’s really 
hard to lead people. It’s hard 
to convince them that you’re 
thinking about them.”
McChrystal’s lecture was 
sponsored by Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Center for International 
Relations and Politics (CIRP) 
and the Humanities Scholars 
Program.
Kiron Skinner, associ-
ate professor of social and 
decision sciences and direc-
tor of CIRP, said, “I thought 
that [the most salient point 
of McChrystal’s lecture] was 
that he focused on people, 
because a lot of time when 
we think about war it’s about 
bombs and bullets and killing 
people and breaking things, 
but he really talked about the 
role that people play in heal-
ing nations and overcoming 
con?ict. For a four-star [gen-
eral] to make that kind of 
argument was extremely pro-
found, and I think it will af-
fect many of our students who 
are thinking about a career in 
national security.”
Students responded posi-
tively to McChrystal’s talk, 
saying that they enjoyed re-
ceiving a different kind of 
perspective on military strate-
gies.
Sophomore international 
relations and politics major 
Jamison Howell said, “When 
you meet with a lot of politi-
cal leaders it’s always great to 
know where they are coming 
from, and you don’t really get 
that from military personnel. 
However, [McChrystal’s lec-
ture] showed that they are 
very compassionate, very un-
derstanding, and there’s a lot 
that goes into [warfare] — it’s 
a much more complex system, 
and I loved being able to hear 
about that.”
First-year international re-
lations major Ariel Lee said, “I 
liked that McChrystal brought 
to our attention the fact that 
we have to look beyond the 
military’s immediate strategic 
goals toward the relationships 
we build with other people. 
When we attack other coun-
tries, it becomes a very imper-
sonal thing because we’re not 
putting American civilians at 
risk, but we can’t lose sight 
that our enemies are actual 
people as well.”
McChrystal resigned from 
his position as commander 
of U.S. forces in Afghanistan 
after he was quoted in a 2010 
Rolling Stone article criticiz-
ing the Obama administra-
tion. He retired from his po-
sition as U.S. general shortly 
thereafter, and he currently 
teaches a course on leader-
ship at Yale University.

pride and energy of students 
and faculty. It’s that passion 
that gets you up at 4 a.m. to 
push buggies up a hill and 
also what makes you want to 
bring something back to the 
university community.”
Five Alumni Achievement 
Awards were given to Dara 
Birnbaum (CFA ’69), Kevin 
Dowling (MCS ’83, SCS ’94, 
’97), H. Scott Matthews (CIT 
’92, TSB ’96, ’99), Paul Rizzo 
(CIT ’63, ’64, ’66), and Ken-
neth Russell (CIT ’64). This 
award recognizes accomplish-
ments and leadership in the 
honoree’s ?eld.
Birnbaum is a renowned 
feminist artist whose work ex-
plores gender roles. “Running 
across both boys and girls in 
the architecture school today 
really made me feel like the 
school had grown,” Birnbaum 
said. She was the only female 
student in her architecture 
class of 1969.
Dowling was the ?rst em-
ployee at Carnegie Mellon’s 
Robotics Institute, and helped 
to build NASA’s mobile robots 
and the ?rst self-driving car. 
He is now vice president for 
research and development at 
MC10, a company that devel-
ops electronic systems, and 
serves on Carnegie Mellon’s 
School of Computer Science 
advisory board.
“My wife and I both gradu-
ated from Carnegie Mellon, 
and we have a kid here now,” 
he said. “We bleed plaid.”
Russell is a professor emer-
itus of metallurgy and nuclear 
engineering at the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, 
and mentored several stu-
dents who later became Carn-
egie Mellon faculty members.
“It’s really, really reward-
ing to receive more from a 
school that’s already given 
me so much,” Russell said. 
“I started looking around for 
more education, and most of 
my engineer buddies were 
working night degrees at 
Carnegie.... I came to Carn-
egie after being accepted at 
three other places and never 
regretted it.”
Three alumni — Margaret 
Johnston (MCS ’72), John 
Shaffner (CFA ’76), and Joe 
Stewart (CFA ’77) — received 
Distinguished Achievement 
Awards. The award recogniz-
es longevity and consistency 
of accomplishment over one’s 
professional lifetime and is 
not awarded every year.
Johnston is a senior pro-
gram of?cer managing tu-
berculosis vaccine and HIV 
research funding for the Bill 
& Melinda Gates Foundation. 
For over 20 years, she worked 
for the National Institutes of 
Health and the National In-
stitute of Allergy and Infec-
tious Diseases, and became a 
global leader in HIV vaccine 
research.
“Very little that I’ve ac-
complished has been as an 
individual, but as a team,” she 
said. “There are hundreds of 
people who have helped me 
do what I do.”
Shaffner and Stewart are 
award winning television pro-
duction designers and have 
used their ?rm, Production 
Design by Shaffner/Stewart, 
to help School of Drama stu-
dents make connections in 
the entertainment industry. 
They have worked on proj-
ects such as The Big Bang The-
ory and The Ellen DeGeneres 
Show. Shaffner and Stew-
art have won seven Emmy 
Awards and an Art Directors 
Guild Award.
Cohon closed the ceremo-
ny with a short speech on the 
importance of alumni to the 
university. 
“These alumni are living, 
breathing manifestations and 
representations of what Carn-
egie Mellon is all about,” he 
said. “It shows us the power 
of our values and the power of 
this institution.”

The Mayur South Asian 
Student Alliance (Mayur 
SASA), along with the Muslim 
Student Alliance and OM, cel-
ebrated both Diwali, a Hindu 
holiday, and Eid al-Adha, a 
Muslim holiday, in Wiegand 
Gymnasium on Thursday. 
The actual date of this year’s 
Diwali is Nov. 13, while Eid 
al-Adha is on Oct. 26. Accord-
ing to Sanjana Padmanabhan, 
?rst-year chemical engineer-
ing major and ?rst-year rep-
resentative in Mayur SASA, 
“We’re combining [Diwali] 
with Eid because it’s around 
the same time.”
“Diwali is the festival of 
lights,” said Meghna Raghu-
nathan, junior design major 
and president of Mayur SASA. 
“It’s a religious celebration ... 
of Rama bringing Sita back 
from Sri Lanka to India.”
Sruti Modekurty, a ?rst-
year electrical and computer 
engineering major who at-
tended the event, went into 
further detail about the sig-
ni?cance of Diwali for Hin-
dus. “Diwali celebrates the re-
turn of a king who was forced 
into exile by his stepmother,” 
Modekurty said. “The king’s 
name is Rama, and he was in 
exile in the forest for 14 years, 
so everyone in his home town 
celebrated his return.... Di-
wali celebrates the return of 
him from exile and him taking 
over, becoming king again.”
Modekurty also described 
how Diwali is traditionally 
celebrated: “We decorate our 
front lawn with tea lights. 
And then sometimes we put 
up Christmas lights around 
our house, and we usually 
make sweets and dress up and 
stuff. And sometimes we set 
off ?recrackers.”
Amulya Uppala, a ?rst-
year computer science major, 
shared how she celebrated 
Diwali at home. “There’s a 
lot of food, a lot [of ?recrack-
ers]. That’s the main part.... 
Basically, you have so many 
different types of ?recrackers, 
you play with them the entire 
night.” Appropriately, Wie-
gand Gymnasium was strung 
with Christmas lights and 
decorated by electric tea can-
dles spread across the ?oor.
Eid al-Adha is an Islamic 
celebration of sacri?ce. Iman 
Mazloum, a ?rst-year inter-
national relations and poli-
tics major and member of the 
Muslim Students Association, 
explained the religious his-
tory of Eid. When Abraham 
was told to sacri?ce his son, 
Ishmael, “Abraham closed 
his eyes and struck down his 
blade, and when he opened 
his eyes, in the place of his 
son was a sheep,” she said. 
Mazloum explained that Eid 
usually involves “a charity of 
normally a sheep to those in 
need.”
The Diwali/Eid celebra-
tion kicked off with South 
Indian food catered by a lo-
cal restaurant; a variety of 
booths around the room had 
games, henna tattoos, face 
painting, and other activities. 
The Mayur SASA and Muslim 
Students Association also had 
their own tables. Halfway into 
the event, the performances 
began, opened by the ?rst 
prayer of the Quran, led by 
Mazloum, and another prayer 
led by the members of OM, an 
organization that describes 
itself as “an independent, 
nonsectarian forum for the 
education and promotion of 
Indian cultural heritage” on 
its website.
Following the prayers 
were exhibitions from Carn-
egie Mellon’s South Asian 
dance teams, including Carn-
egie Mellon Raasta — a dance 
team that practices the West 
Indian folk dance garba-raas 
— and Carnegie Mellon’s of-
?cial Bhangra team.
Teja Shah, a senior bio-
medical and mechanical 
engineering major, did a 
solo dance routine as well. 
There was also a perfor-
mance by Neel Kadkarni, a 
junior business administra-
tion major, who sang songs 
by a renowned Indian singer, 
Mohammed Ra?. Kadkarni 
was assisted by Tejavir Singh 
Rekhi, a ?rst-year art major, 
on the tabla. The last per-
formance of the event was 
by members of the executive 
board of Mayur SASA, who all 
danced to an Indian remix of 
PSY’s “Gangnam Style.”
Although Diwali and Eid 
al-Adha are still upcoming, 
the celebration in Wiegand 
Gymnasium captured the 
spirit of the holidays for Cèi-
lidh Weekend. As Padmanab-
han said, it was a great time 
“just to bring everyone to-
gether.”

he has supported increasing 
spending on the public school 
system, Romney would cut 
funds to such schools while 
attempting to lower the na-
tion’s de?cit. Romney denied 
these claims. He noted that 
while he was the governor of 
the state, Massachusetts had 
the top public school system 
in the nation.
He remarked, “You’re en-
titled, President, as the presi-
dent, to your own airplane 
and your own house, but not 
to your own facts.... I’m not 
going to cut education fund-
ing.” Regarding Obama’s edu-
cation program, Race to the 
Top, Romney conceded that 
he agreed with “some” of its 
ideas, but again, he did not 
provide speci?cs.
Following the debate, 
many felt Romney had fared 
better. A CNN/ORC poll con-
ducted immediately after 
the debate showed that 67 
percent of Americans felt 
Romney was stronger, com-
pared to only 25 percent for 
Obama. Romney appeared re-
laxed and more poised, while 
Obama maintained a defen-
sive, serious, and professional 
tone.
There was also no men-
tion of Romney’s infamous 47 
percent comments, in which 
he claimed the President’s 
supporters are dependent 
on the government and wel-
fare. Evidently, many felt the 
President’s cautious, “safe” 
debating strategy was not as 
effective as Romney’s more 
aggressive approach.
Carnegie Mellon students 
who watched the debate in 
McConomy took away differ-
ent opinions.
Ben Burgess, a ?rst-year 
music major, said, “The de-
bate was well done in the 
sense that both candidates 
were prepared to debate. 
They were both prepared for 
each other, and I respect that. 
I do think that Romney ended 
up being on offense [more] 
than Obama was, making 
points that Obama could not 
respond to well.”
Aaron Zhang, a junior 
electrical and computer engi-
neering major, said, “I think 
[Obama and Romney] have 
the same opinions, but just 
want to disagree with each 
other.”
Whether or not the debate 
will have a lasting effect on 
voters’ decisions is still un-
clear. “It would appear that 
Romney put forth stronger, 
more deliberate points, but 
I still didn’t like the way that 
he went to such lengths to 
enforce his views on the de-
bate,” Burgess said. “I’m not 
convinced Romney’s the can-
didate for us, so for now I’ll 
stick with Obama.”
However, a recent Ras-
mussen poll has shown that 
in Ohio, Romney now has 
a 51–48 percent advantage 
over the President among vot-
ers who are de?nitely voting, 
and that following the debate, 
among individuals nation-
wide who are certain to vote, 
50 percent said they would 
vote for Obama while 49 per-
cent supported Romney.
Make sure to tune in to the 
vice presidential debate on 
Thursday, and the town hall-
style presidential debate next 
Tuesday.

Pittsburgh-based space 
robotics company Astrobotic 
Technology, Inc. rolled out 
the ?rst prototype of its lunar 
ice prospecting robot, Polaris, 
in the Gates Center at its ?rst 
of?cial public unveiling.
As a part of the Cèilidh 
Weekend festivities, the Lunar 
Robot Open House brought 
students, staff, family, and 
alumni around a stage that 
held Polaris as William “Red” 
Whittaker spoke about the 
rover. A Robotics Institute 
professor and Astrobotic’s 
CEO, Whittaker described 
the goal of Polaris: to explore 
the vast underground water 
and gas resources discovered 
as ice on the Moon two years 
ago.
Polaris, equipped with a 
drill and other prospecting 
equipment, can answer ques-
tions about the gas that satel-
lite data cannot. “What is it, 
what is it made of, where is 
it, what is its concentration, 
can you extract it, can you use 
it?” Whittaker said. “[Polaris] 
changes everything.”
Answering these questions 
could have a large impact on 
the future of space explora-
tion. “This polar ice, when 
utilized, can transform the 
whole direction of space ex-
ploration,” Whittaker said. 
“Because see, if you could re-
fuel after leaving the Earth, 
you can go anywhere.” But to 
learn how to use this extrater-
restrial gas to fuel travel be-
yond our current limits, Whit-
taker explained we must ?rst 
travel to the Moon.
And this will be dif?cult, 
he said, because the rover will 
be completely autonomous. 
Without radio GPS and re-
mote control, the robot will 
have to compare its surround-
ings to satellite images of the 
Moon’s surface to determine 
its location. It will have to see 
and maneuver around rocks 
larger than 15 centimeters —
or roughly the size of a bowl-
ing ball — that could obstruct 
its path. Perhaps the most 
dif?cult challenge is how the 
solar-powered Polaris would 
balance operating in areas 
that not only have ice, but also 
sunlight.
In October 2015, Astro-
botic plans to send Polaris to a 
carefully chosen location near 
the Moon’s northern pole. 
Like the Earth, the Moon’s 
region with the most frozen 
resources is also its coldest 
and darkest: the poles. The 
rover must utilize complex al-
gorithms to predict when and 
where shadows will fall as it 
travels the surface and as the 
Moon changes positions. For 
the mission to be a success, 
the rover needs to detect both 
ice and sunlight.
Polaris also needs to be 
able to successfully land, and 
to achieve this, Astrobotic is 
also developing a high-preci-
sion lander. Once the lander 
and its payload near the de-
sired region of the Moon’s 
surface, it will slow down and 
hover for about four days be-
fore it decides where to land 
and make its slow descent.
In addition to accuracy, 
the lander will also boast 
versatility. Kevin Peterson, a 
Ph.D. student in robotics who 
has worked on the project 
for two years, explained the 
many features of the lander’s 
design.
“... this lander is designed 
for this rover, [but also] for 
the smaller rover and for car-
rying payloads underneath. 
We can go without a rover 
all together, as long as we are 
within our mass constraints, 
which are fairly large, actual-
ly,” Peterson said. “That lets us 
design one lander and then go 
out and ?nd a payload.” This 
will allow the company, which 
is already receiving $1 million 
a year from NASA alone, to 
easily commercialize its land-
er to other Moon-goers.
“The company’s goal is not 
to win the X PRIZE; it is to 
commercialize space,” Aaron 
Acton said, referring to the 
Google Lunar X PRIZE, the 
largest contest of its kind in 
history. Acton has been work-
ing on the project for more 
than three years, ever since he 
began his master’s in mechan-
ical engineering. “As part of 
that goal, to win the X PRIZE, 
would be great,” he added.
According to Google’s X 
PRIZE website, “A total of $30 
million in prizes are available 
to the ?rst privately funded 
teams to safely land a robot on 
the surface of the Moon, have 
that robot travel 500 meters 
over the lunar surface, and 
send video, images, and data 
back to the Earth.”
Astrobotic was founded 
shortly after the announce-
ment of the contest in 2008, 
and is determined to compete 
with 26 other groups. With its 
team of over a dozen Carnegie 
Mellon students and alumni, 
the company is preparing to 
move to a new location so that 
it can expand its research and 
operations.

Glasses come in all shapes 
and sizes, and so do the eyes 
using them. Despite their di-
versity, all human eyes work 
in relatively the same fashion; 
so what exactly is happening 
inside a set of eyes that need 
glasses?
To answer this question, 
it’s necessary to explain how 
the eye views an image. As 
light reaches the eye, it ?rst 
passes through the cornea — 
the clear tissue at the front 
of the eye — and enters the 
eye through the pupil. Next, 
it passes through the lens, 
which is behind the pupil, 
and ?nally reaches the retina 
at the back of the eye.
In a perfectly-functioning 
eye, the lens and the cornea 
refract, bending light rays 
and focusing them on the 
retina. Due to this refraction, 
the image appears inverted 
on the retina, so it must be 
adjusted by the brain.
Light from images is fo-
cused on the center of the 
retina. There are a number of 
vision problems that prevent 
this, however, and they make 
wearing glasses necessary. 
These vision problems — 
known as refractive errors — 
are myopia, hyperopia, astig-
matisms, and presbyopia.
Myopia, or nearsighted-
ness, means the eyeball is 
longer than normal so the 
retina is too far back. In this 
case, the eye is too long for 
the lens and cornea to prop-
erly focus. As a result, instead 
of reaching the retina, light 
from images is focused in 
front of the retina. According 
to the American Optometric 
Association, nearly 30 per-
cent of the U.S. population 
is affected by myopia, and 
growing evidence shows that 
the condition is in?uenced by 
visual stress.
Nearsightedness can be 
treated with glasses or con-
tacts with convex-shaped 
lenses. Convex lenses cause 
light to scatter, and it must be 
converged again by the lens of 
the eye. This shifts the focal 
point of the eye back, so that 
the image is focused on the 
retina instead of in front of it.
On the other hand, people 
with hyperopia, or farsight-
edness, have shorter eye-
balls; their retinas are too far 
forward, resulting in images 
being focused behind the cor-
nea. Farsighted individuals 
can view distant objects with 
relative ease, but struggle to 
see nearby objects. Hyperopia 
can be corrected by glasses or 
contacts with concave lenses, 
which cause light to be re-
fracted toward the center. As 
a result, the focal point of the 
eye’s lens is pushed forward 
so the image is focused on the 
retina rather than behind it.
Myopia and hyperopia 
may be accompanied by astig-
matisms, which occur when 
an individual’s cornea has an 
irregular shape, causing light 
from images to refract in dif-
ferent directions rather than 
at one focal point on the ret-
ina. As a result, astigmatisms 
usually blur images.
They can be treated with 
eyeglasses that have spheri-
cal lenses, which compensate 
for the irregular shape of the 
cornea and prevent light from 
being refracted in different 
directions. They can be also 
be corrected with orthokera-
tology, which involves wear-
ing specially-designed, rigid 
contact lenses that slowly ad-
just the shape of the cornea so 
it bends light correctly.
Presbyopia is caused by 
age rather than eye struc-
ture. In order to properly fo-
cus light, the lens of the eye 
needs to be able to widen and 
compress. However, around 
age 40, the lens of the eye 
begins to harden and lose 
its ?exibility. As a result, the 
eye has dif?culty bringing 
both near and far images into 
focus.
Presbyopia can be cor-
rected with bifocal lenses, 
which can focus on distant 
images throughout the lens 
and on near images at the 
bottom of the lens. It can also 
be addressed with specially 
designed contact lenses that 
either have a reading and dis-
tance prescription for each 
eye, or have a reading pre-
scription for one eye and a 
distance prescription for the 
other.
Myopia, hyperopia, pres-
byopia, and astigmatisms can 
also be treated with LASIK 
eye surgery. The principle be-
hind LASIK is to apply a laser 
beam to the cornea to remove 
enough of the corneal tissue 
to reshape the eye as needed, 
which involves cutting open 
and pulsating a laser on the 
cornea until enough of the 
tissue is removed.

HOW THINGS WORK
 BROOKE KUEI
Junior Staffwriter
“Museum people and soft-
ware engineers speak radi-
cally different languages and 
basically do not choose to 
spend time with one another,” 
said Marc Donner, engineer-
ing director for Google’s New 
York City of?ce, during a lec-
ture last Thursday in Rashid 
Auditorium. His Google Art 
Project aims to bridge the gap 
between the computer world 
and the art world.
Donner, a Carnegie Mel-
lon alumnus, entertained 
the idea of a digital art mu-
seum in 2007: “Already we 
see things happening in the 
library world that should be 
causing excitement in the 
museum world,” Donner 
wrote in a blog post, refer-
ring to how traditional library 
shelves are being replaced by 
scanned images of books on 
a server on the internet. He 
admitted that art is more dif-
?cult to capture digitally than 
are books.
“But rendering the appear-
ance of a surface under arbi-
trary illumination and viewed 
from any distance or angle is 
well within the reach of most 
of the graphics engines incor-
porated into modern desktop 
and laptop computers,” Don-
ner said. “The technology is 
available now to deliver many 
of the experiences we seek 
from ?ne art objects over the 
internet.”
Fast-forward to Donner’s 
lecture: After telling the sto-
ry of Caravaggio, an Italian 
artist who was rediscovered 
around World War I after be-
ing forgotten when he died 
in 1610, Donner asked, “Are 
there any other great artists 
that we don’t know that have 
been forgotten by art histo-
rians and scholars and the 
public, buried in collections 
somewhere? Who believes 
there are no more?”
No one in the audience 
raised their hands. “And 
that’s why we need a digital 
museum,” Donner said.
The digital museum, Don-
ner explained, was no easy 
feat. Google had the tech-
nology and the manpower to 
bring such an idea to life, but 
it needed to convince muse-
ums that the internet was not 
simply a channel for market-
ing, and that Google wasn’t 
just in it for the money — it 
was interested in expanding 
the appreciation for art.
After brainstorming, the 
company decided to use the 
same concept behind the 
Street View feature in Google 
Maps to produce virtual tours 
of museums.
The project’s ?rst big 
break came when an employ-
ee in Google’s Madrid of?ce 
used her connections with 
the Prado museum and per-
suaded it to let Google put 14 
of its masterpieces online via 
Google Earth.
“We took a lot of pictures 
and pieced them together 
to try to make them various 
kinds of squares so you can 
do the arbitrary zooming that 
Google Earth can do,” Donner 
said. “It was tremendously 
expensive, but it made a huge 
splash in the art community.”
Donner said that an art 
historian at the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York City, 
who had been discussing 
the idea of a digital museum 
with Google during this time, 
was impressed. “She said she 
was able to see things in that 
painting that she had never 
seen before,” Donner said. 
This was a turning point in 
the project: Once the Mu-
seum of Modern Art wanted 
to be a part of it, so did other 
notable museums, such as the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Last February, the Google 
Art Project of?cially launched. 
Donner explained that the 
participating museums not 
only saw their website traf-
?c increase, but the number 
of visitors — both return-
ing customers and new art 
enthusiasts. Google had 
achieved its goal of using the 
internet to expand the art 
community.
Today, there are 151 mu-
seums and over 30,000 works 
of art on the Google Art Proj-
ect. It currently allows users 
to take tours through muse-
ums, examine works of art in 
great detail, and chat about 
art pieces via Google Hang-
out. As for the future, Google 
is working on implementing 
Google Goggles, which will 
allow users to take a picture 
of a painting in a museum 
and immediately be present-
ed with facts about it.
While the Google Art Proj-
ect can be used as an educa-
tional tool, “It’s still not good 
enough to be a research tool,” 
Donner said. “But it’s begin-
ning to show some promise in 
a lot of ways in which muse-
ums are trying to reach out to 
society at large.”

Urban coyotes pose problems for city dwellers
Scientists have located the 
smallest known coyote ter-
ritory ?ve miles away from 
Chicago’s O’Hare airport. 
The team said that the coy-
ote community has thrived in 
an area about one third of a 
square mile for six years.
“That’s an indication that 
they don’t have to go far to 
?nd food and water,” said 
Stan Gehrt, an associate pro-
fessor of environment and 
natural resources at Ohio 
State University who has 
tracked the coyotes around 
Chicago for 12 years. 
Some researchers are 
worried that the advent of 
coyote communities in cities 
may have larger classes of 
carnivores following suit.

New development made in quantum cryptography
Researchers from the Uni-

homa State University, and 
the University of Houston cre-
ated a new method of quan-
tum cryptography that uses 
photons to code messages to 
increase data security.
Pramode Verma, a Uni-
versity of Oklahoma electri-
cal and computer engineer-
ing professor, explained that 
programs using current cryp-
tography techniques become 
susceptible to attacks that can 
recover sensitive information 
as they become larger.
The unpredictable nature 
of photons ensures that hack-
ers can’t access information 
used to transmit sensitive

Paleontologist reveals new dinosaur species
University of Chicago pa-
leontologist Paul Sereno has 
recently published his ?nd-
ings of a dinosaur species he 
discovered in South Africa. 
The dinosaur is called 
Pegomastax africanus — or 
“thick jaw from Africa” — 
and it roamed the Earth be-
tween 100 million and 200 
million years ago. The one-
foot tall animal’s size, frills, 
and tooth structure have led 
some to label it a cross be-
tween a bird, a vampire, and 
a porcupine.
Sereno explained that he 
had actually uncovered the 
species back in 1983, but

Scientists turn on world’s fastest radio telescope 
Scientists in Murchison, 
Australia, have powered on 
the world’s fastest radio tele-
scope, dubbed the Australia 
Square Kilometre Array Path-
?nder (ASKAP), to help sur-
vey the universe and map out 
black holes.
“Radio waves tell us 
unique things about the 
cosmos, about the gas from 
which stars were formed, and 
about exotic objects, pulsars 
and quasars, that really push 
the boundaries of our knowl-
edge of the physical laws 
in the universe,” said Brian 
Boyle, director of the project.
The ASKAP is located in an 
area roughly the size of Costa 
Rica with a total population 
of 120 people, as man-made 
radio signals would nega-
tively impact the telescope’s 
effectiveness.

Facebook announces 1 billionth member  
Facebook, the world’s 
largest social network, an-
nounced last week that it had 
surpassed the one billion ac-
tive users mark. This achieve-
ment places Facebook among 
the fastest-growing websites 
in history.
In spite of this success, the 
company has been struggling 
to remain ?nancially competi-
tive. After Facebook’s initial 
public offering in May, its 
stock price fell to as low as 53 
percent of its original value 
last month, and has not fully 
recovered. Following inves-
tors’ cries to ?nd alternative 
sources of revenue, the com-
pany has recently turned to 
asking its users to pay to pro-
mote important posts, photos, 
and status updates.

Doctors improve detection of rare genetic disorders 
Doctors and researchers 
at Children’s Mercy Hospitals 
and Clinics in Kansas City, 
Mo., have created software 
that can analyze the DNA of 
newborn babies and detect 
rare genetic disorders early. 
This new technique brings 
the time spent diagnosing 
these disorders from potential 
weeks or months down to just 
two days. Speedy diagnoses 
lead to speedy treatments, 
which can make the differ-
ence between life and death 
in the early phases of an in-
fant’s life.
“This is the biggest break-
through in this technology for 
clinical applications we have 
seen in a few years,” said Da-
vid Dimmock, a geneticist not 
involved in the study.

This year, the Career and Profes-
sional Development Center took a 
step in the right direction by sending 
out emails to Dietrich College stu-
dents informing them of companies 
recruiting students majoring in the 
humanities. 
The recruiters will be looking for 
talent at the Employment Opportu-
nities Conference (EOC) on Thurs-
day and the WestPACS job fair in 
Monroeville next Wednesday. How-
ever, these emails also reveal that 
the Career and Professional Devel-
opment Center needs to do more to 
help students majoring in the liberal 
arts ?nd jobs after college. 
The vast majority of the 34 compa-
nies looking for Dietrich undergrad-
uates at the EOC are only looking 
for economics, information systems, 
and “consulting” majors. And while 
there are plenty of opportunities for 
majors other than these at the West-
PACS job fair, most students will be 
unable to make it to Monroeville for 
the Wednesday afternoon event in 
the middle of midterms. 
Instead, the Career and Profes-
sional Development Center needs to 
take an active role in ?nding oppor-
tunities for Dietrich students. One 
way it can do this is by making space 
in the EOC for some of the compa-
nies at WestPACS recruiting for the 
humanities: Currently, none of the 
22 companies at WestPACS that are 
recruiting writing, journalism, com-
munications, or public relations ma-
jors will be present at the EOC. These 
companies include some big names 
such as UPMC, Panera Bread, and 
Prudential. 
These companies have recruited 
at Carnegie Mellon in the past. The 
Career and Professional Develop-
ment Center should have made more 
of an effort to have them at this 
year’s EOC, if only so that humani-
ties majors don’t have to make the 
trek off campus while engineering 
and technical majors have compa-
nies brought to them.
Carnegie Mellon is not usually as-
sociated with the humanities and so-
cial sciences. Our past employment 
statistics and career fairs re?ect this 
fact. However, by accepting William 
Dietrich’s gift last year and naming 
a college after him, the school made 
a commitment to the humanities 
and social sciences, a commitment 
to make Carnegie Mellon a leader 
in those areas with the $265 million 
gift from the late industrialist. 
The Career and Professional De-
velopment Center should honor this 
by striving to provide Dietrich majors 
with as many, if not more, opportu-
nities for employment than those 
that students might ?nd in Monro-
eville or anywhere else.
Postponement of voter ID law is righteous decision
Dietrich students need greater opportunities at EOC
Cèilidh needs better promotion, student awareness
We said it last year, and we’ll say 
it again: Cèilidh weekend needs to be 
better advertised.
The Homecoming-International 
Festival-Family Weekend extrava-
ganza made its debut last fall and, as 
noted by our Editorial Board’s review 
of the event last year, it was in des-
perate need of more cohesive brand-
ing and aggressive marketing. 
This year’s Cèilidh Weekend 
seems to have fallen even farther be-
hind on making its presence known 
ahead of time. Last year, signs an-
nouncing the weekend-long event 
could be found around the Univer-
sity Center and across the Cut. This 
year, minimal signage was on dis-
play, making it hard for students — 
especially ?rst-years — to become 
aware of the festivities.
The event coordinators seem to 
have continued to market Cèilidh 
via social networking — a great tool 
for spreading information if used 
successfully. 
Unfortunately, this strategy didn’t 
work this year. With 116 “likes” on 
its Facebook page, Cèilidh Weekend 
2012 didn’t get the exposure it need-
ed. There needs to be a greater level 
of public awareness of the event be-
fore social media can be used effec-
tively to promote it. 
Furthermore, the only link the 
Facebook page has to more infor-
mation takes the user to last year’s 
schedule of events. This obscures the 
information vital to the hoped for 
success of Cèilidh 2012.
If Cèilidh is truly going to be a suc-
cess for students and alumni alike, 
it must be promoted to the student 
body more effectively. It must mar-
ket itself as a fall version of Spring 
Carnival: Align it with fall break to 
give students a breather and time to 
enjoy the events and their families, 
include more student-run events, 
and ruthlessly promote it to the stu-
dent body.
Often students feel unaware of 
Cèilidh Weekend, and when they are, 
they are stressed because they don’t 
have the time to enjoy the events. If 
the coordinators want students to 
participate in Cèilidh Weekend and 
establish it as a lasting tradition, we 
must be given the information and 
time to do so.

The Commonwealth Court of 
Pennsylvania halted the implemen-
tation of a new voter ID law in the 
midst of a lawsuit.
Judge Robert Simpson ruled on 
Tuesday to block the new measure 
from coming into effect before the 
2012 election, citing concerns about 
unfairly excluding legally eligible 
voters from casting their ballots in 
November.
The voter ID law, which would 
require voters to present state-issued 
photo IDs in order to cast their bal-
lots, was accused of voter disenfran-
chisement for poor minorities and 
the elderly.
Halting this measure is an excel-
lent move by Judge Simpson, chal-
lenging the implementation of harsh 
standards intended to address a 
problem that doesn’t exist. Evidence 
of voter fraud in Pennsylvania has 
been scant at best, with state of?cials 
stating in a stipulation in July that 
there have been “no investigations or 
prosecutions of in-person voter fraud 
in Pennsylvania.” 
Contrast this with the estimated 
1.36 million Pennsylvania residents 
that do not possess a valid photo ID, 
according to University of Washing-
ton associate professor Matt A. Bar-
reto in an article on Philly.com, and 
the problem becomes evident. These 
individuals would be put through a 
time-consuming bureaucratic pro-
cess if they wished to vote in the up-
coming presidential election.
The groups most likely affected 
by voter ID laws are inner-city mi-
norities and the elderly. These de-
mographics may have dif?culty pro-
ducing a birth certi?cate for their 
identi?cation or getting transporta-
tion to a DMV in order to have their 
identity veri?ed. In addition, mem-
bers of these groups may not have 
the means or know-how to complete 
the bureaucratic application process 
for a state ID.
While voter fraud is a serious is-
sue, the implementation of a new, 
complex voter ID system despite 
little to no recorded cases of fraud 
seems unnecessarily punitive, espe-
cially with the presidential election 
next month.
Preventing voter fraud is a noble 
goal, but it doesn’t require the im-
mediate attention of Pennsylvania 
legislators. 
Should an improved voter ID 
system be put into place, it should 
be announced prior to, not during, 
an election year, and should have 
more helpful mechanisms for indi-
viduals who need their identi?cation 
veri?ed.
Economy must be top issue for young voters
KYLE HENSON
The overwhelming sentiment 
among my peers when I talk about 
this election is as follows: “Well, I’m 
disappointed in Obama, but I just 
couldn’t bring myself to vote for a 
Republican.” 
When asked why, they will al-
most always reply, “Well I just can’t 
vote for someone who’s against gay 
marriage and pro-life.”
Are we really that naive? I’m a 
strong libertarian. I think the gov-
ernment shouldn’t be able to tell you 
what to do with your money, and I 
also think the government shouldn’t 
be able to tell you what to do with 
your body or who you can marry. 
Your right to swing your ?st ends 
where my nose begins. But the view 
of most young voters is currently the 
status quo, and it takes absolutely 
no leadership, conviction, audac-
ity, or skill for a politician to take a 
stance for or against either of those 
two issues. They’re not changing 
and everyone knows it.
We supported President Barack 
Obama when he was against gay 
marriage in 2008. Only recently did 
he change his personal support, but 
he never changed his of?cial view. 
Obama and Republican presiden-
tial candidate Mitt Romney in fact 
share the same view on the issue. 
Both want to leave it to the states to 
decide if same-sex couples can get 
married. That’s the status quo. Re-
gardless of who holds the Oval Of-
?ce come January, gay marriage at 
the federal level will be unchanged. 
Obama is pro-choice, Romney is 
pro-life. It’ll take a constitutional 
amendment to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
If you as a voter have any faith in 
the belligerent, bicameral mess that 
is our legislative branch of govern-
ment to garner enough support to 
pass a constitutional amendment, 
and then that three-fourths of the 
state legislatures will ratify such 
an amendment, then you’re a bet-
ter person than I. The only thing 
Congress has done that I can re-
member in recent history is declare 
pizza a vegetable.
It’s really easy for Obama to 
go on some talk show and tell the 
world that he is for gay marriage. He 
doesn’t have to push for it in Con-
gress, and he hasn’t made a big deal 
about it since. Similarly, Romney 
being pro-life takes absolutely noth-
ing. He just has to say it. That’s it.
It takes no strength to adopt a 
meaningless stance that does ab-
solutely nothing for the American 
people because the status quo on so-
cial issues isn’t changing. You don’t 
see Romney red-faced on the stump, 
touting the injustices of abortion. 
The election is about the economy. 
And guess what? According to the 
Associated Press, 53.6 percent of 
college graduates can’t get good 
jobs.
Are we as young voters really 
naive enough to make any other is-
sue more important then that one 
fact? If you can’t pay for an abortion 
or your same-sex wedding, it’s not 
going to happen whether it’s legal 
or not.
When we graduate from college, 
we’ll be entering either Romney’s 
economy or Obama’s. Four years of 
Obama’s economy has left half of 
our predecessors jobless or under-
employed. For the sake of your own 
future, wake up and give the other 
guy a chance.

A PERSON’S OPINION

Romney’s victory over Obama is debatable
LUKE MASA
Junior Staffwriter
In what some consider a shock-
ing turn of events, the media at large 
seems to have declared former Mas-
sachusetts Governor and current Re-
publican presidential candidate Mitt 
Romney the winner of last Wednes-
day’s presidential debate.
The debate itself was the ?rst of 
three between Romney and Presi-
dent Barack Obama in these last 
weeks leading up to the November 
election. 
Obama, after his stunning perfor-
mances in the 2008 debates and with 
his general charismatic demeanor, 
was predicted to win the debate. Yet 
Romney had already proven himself 
in battles of rhetoric, winning many 
of the debates in the Republican pri-
maries earlier this year.
So how exactly did Romney win? 
After all, his body language sug-
gested an odd mix of confusion and 
smugness every time the president 
spoke, and he continued to not reveal 
any part of the grand plan he’s been 
talking about this election cycle, oth-
er than the fact that he can assure us 
good things will be a part of it. 
Much of the sentiment online 
was outrage at Romney’s apparent 
desire to “?re” Big Bird; that is, to 
cut the funding for PBS, which airs 
the beloved children’s education 
show Sesame Street. He claimed he 
had nothing against the giant yel-
low fowl, but already the meme has 
spread like wild?re and will no doubt 
continue to grow at least through No-
vember.
Romney also should have been 
weakened when Obama laid bare 
Romney’s idea for a Medicare vouch-
er system before the audience. This 
alone should have scored Obama big 
points, but it wasn’t nearly as effec-
tive as it should have been because 
of his lack of aggression during the 
debate.
There are many reasons why 
Romney was declared the winner of 
this debate by the masses. It could be 
the case that the president had little 
time to prepare, being the leader of 
the free world and all. Romney threw 
out quite a few zingers and was 
therefore perceived to be sharper and 
more aggressive during the debate.
It could also be the case that 
moderator Jim Lehrer let Romney 
talk over him and wrestle control of 
the evening away. This point is de-
batable, though, as Lehrer was not 
forceful with either candidate, and 
the president appeared to talk over 
Lehrer quite often himself. 
Finally, and perhaps most unlike-
ly, there is a rather conspiratorially 
minded conjecture making its rounds 
online that Obama was playing a lit-
tle “rope-a-dope” with Romney, lull-
ing him into a false sense of security 
by letting him win this round, but 
planning on coming out swinging 
next time. 
To me, this seems like a silly ex-
cuse. Why would Obama — by all ac-
counts a usually con?dent, competi-
tive guy — lose if he could help it? It 
seems more likely that he was caught 
off-guard this time rather than hav-
ing some sort of Machiavellian game 
in store.
Regardless of the potential rea-
sons the Democrats could give, the 
media has spoken. 
Romney has won round one. But 
don’t count the president out just yet: 
He has a much better gauge on what 
he’s up against and he learns from his 
mistakes. He can be less abstract and 
more passionate when the situation 
calls for it, and it seems more likely 
now that he will go on a full offen-
sive, pulling no punches while mov-
ing forward.
With round one behind us, the 
election seems closer than ever. 
It’s politics in action, and I, for one, 
could not be more excited. Let the 
best man win.
Artifact ownership  is an issue
LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVEStudent body executive emphasizes election
Fellow Tartans, 
As Tuesday, Oct. 9, marks the ?-
nal day for individuals to register to 
vote in the state of Pennsylvania, Will 
Weiner and I wanted to take a mo-
ment to thank the Carnegie Mellon 
community for its continued enthu-
siasm surrounding the election and 
to remind you of the importance of 
remaining politically informed and 
involved up until the Nov. 6 election 
date. 
First and foremost, we have been 
so incredibly pleased by the amount 
of young people who registered to 
vote within the past few months. 
Representatives from Student Gov-
ernment as well as several other or-
ganizations from both the Carnegie 
Mellon community and the greater 
Pittsburgh area have worked incred-
ibly hard to vocalize the importance 
of voting and urge members of our 
community to register. Together, we 
have collected boxes upon boxes of 
voter registrations, and we are proud 
of the student body’s efforts to get in-
volved.
Secondly, Will and I were also de-
lighted by the turnout at our screen-
ing of this past week’s U.S. Presiden-
tial Debate. 
A total of 378 individuals stopped 
by McConomy Auditorium to watch 
the debate. 
Being able to witness the reac-
tions of the audience during the de-
bate made for a truly interactive and 
entertaining night, and we enjoyed 
hearing the thoughts and reactions of 
those students who stayed afterwards 
to discuss the debate and re?ect on 
each candidate’s performance. 
While we have witnessed great 
enthusiasm surrounding this year’s 
elections so far, we want to make 
sure to maintain said enthusiasm up 
until Election Day. 
Will and I would like to use this 
space to encourage members of our 
community to stay informed by keep-
ing up with election news and con-
tinue efforts to stay politically active 
on campus — whether it be through 
an organization, events, or merely 
friendly conversations. 
By Oct. 15, we will have informa-
tion on cmu.edu/stugov detailing lo-
cal candidates and issues to help you 
become more informed about key lo-
cal issues.
Furthermore, we wanted to re-
mind students that while we will 
be holding Debate Watching Par-
ties for the remaining two presi-
dential debates (information about 
these events will be postered 
around campus and announced 
through our Facebook page, 
www.facebook.com/cmusbp), there 
are many other informative election-
related events occurring both in our 
area and on national broadcasts. 
While we will not be showing the 
vice presidential or local debates, we 
strongly encourage you all to tune 
in or attend. If you have any ques-
tions regarding voting, ways to get 
involved on or off campus, or any-
thing else, feel free to reach out to us 
either through of?ce hours (which 
will be held on Tuesday, Oct. 9, 
from 4:30–5:30 p.m.) or by email at 
sbp@andrew.cmu.

IKEA catalog contributes to culture of oppression
WILLIAM PARK
Junior Staffwriter
This summer, Sarah Attar became 
the ?rst Saudi Arabian woman to 
participate in the Olympic games. 
The BBC reported that in 2015, Sau-
di Arabian women will be allowed to 
vote in municipal elections for the 
?rst time.
In a country where culture has 
dictated women’s dependency on 
men, this shows progress in the right 
direction. That’s why it’s unfortunate 
that one Swedish-based company has 
reminded us of Saudi Arabia’s mi-
sogynist past and pervading gender 
inequality.
In the Saudi Arabian version of 
the latest IKEA catalog, women have 
been completely airbrushed out of it. 
From a feminist perspective, it’s easy 
to bemoan the male-dominated cul-
ture that prevents women from ap-
pearing in furniture advertisements. 
In the 21st century, it is a shame that 
there is a country where women can-
not travel or work without the per-
mission of a male guardian.
But what role does IKEA play in 
this gender discussion? It is, after all, 
just trying to sell furniture. Whether 
IKEA is directly responsible for these 
changes is unknown. According to a 
report in the Los Angeles Times, IKEA 
has since issued the following state-
ment, “We should have reacted to the 
exclusion of women from the Saudi 
Arabian version of the catalog since 
it does not align with the IKEA group 
values.”
On paper, this statement was po-
litically correct, but in perspective, it 
was unnecessary. Major companies 
broadcast different advertisements 
in countries with different cultural 
norms. IKEA was correct in its inten-
tion to respect Saudi Arabian values, 
but unfortunately, it overplayed the 
cultural sensitivity card.
To photograph a woman in a 
compromising and risque position 
in Saudi Arabia is unacceptable. 
However, femininity isn’t so greatly 
suppressed that women cannot be 
presented in a respectful manner. For 
IKEA to assume the worst was a bla-
tant offense to the steps being made 
toward gender equality. Women now 
work alongside men, and women will 
continue to ?nd employment with in-
creased educational opportunities.
In an age where information be-
tween people of con?icting ideolo-
gies can be easily shared, it will be 
impossible for Saudi Arabia to keep 
women tied down forever. These 
forces are already in action.
In the meantime, we must real-
ize that the beliefs that have justi?ed 
the oppression of women in the past 
will not change overnight. But, as the 
catalog demonstrated, to completely 
ignore the presence of women in do-
mestic lives is not an act of respect, 
but an exaggeration of a cultural 
rigidity that is slowly beginning to 
crumble.

According to Philly.com, last 
month, the University of Pennsyl-
vania Museum of Archaeology and 
Anthropology lent Turkey 24 arti-
facts from ancient Troy — inde?-
nitely. This move by the museum 
was due to Turkey’s aggressive 
campaign to retrieve artifacts that 
originated in its region.
Both the Museum of Fine Arts 
in Boston and the Pergamon Mu-
seum in Berlin have returned ar-
tifacts. Of?cials of the Pergamon 
claim they did so under the threat 
of Turkey blocking further archae-
ological projects. 
Last year, Turkish of?cials told 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
in New York that if certain artifacts 
were not returned, all exchange of 
artifacts from Turkey would stop. 
Museum of?cials from all over the 
world were not happy with this 
declaration.
Artifacts are a very important 
part of any nation’s cultural con-
sciousness. It is understandable 
that Turkey wants them back. 
However, the country’s of?cials 
might want to go about retrieving 
these treasures a little more gently. 
While blackmail has its merits, it is 
not known for smoothing interna-
tional relations.
The dilemma of deciding where 
an artifact should be displayed 
may seem inconsequential to 
Americans, or even to people who 
live in an area with a history of po-
litical and ethnic stability. Stability 
— ethnic or otherwise — has been 
in short supply for much of the 
Anatolian Peninsula’s history.
Turkey claims it only wants to 
recover looted objects — objects 
that should rightfully be in their 
countries of origin, as some of?-
cials say. As Murat Suslu, director-
general of cultural heritage and 
museums in Turkey, told The New 
York Times last week, “If you come 
to my house and you steal precious 
objects from me, do I not have a 
right to get them back?” 
But, as the president of the 
Prussian Cultural Heritage Foun-
dation Hermann Parzinger also 
pointed out to The New York 
Times, “[Turkey] should be careful 
about making moral claims when 
their museums are full of looted 
treasures.”
Parzinger is right to point out 
this discrepancy in Turkey’s policy. 
Many museums have stolen arti-
facts, because stealing the trea-
sures of a conquered nation was 
the norm until after World War II. 
Artifacts were consequently scat-
tered all over the world; archae-
ologists, historians, and museum 
of?cials have had enormous trou-
ble determining where artifacts 
belong. 
The question of where arti-
facts should reside is a murky one, 
which is why the international 
community has a myriad of differ-
ent protocols on how to deal with 
artifacts, ancient and otherwise. 
But Turkey’s campaign has the 
potential to upset this delicate bal-
ance that museum of?cials have 
worked for decades to maintain.

After its disappointing 
?rst loss of the season against 
Washington University of St. 
Louis, the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team came 
back this Saturday to win 2–1 
over the University of Chica-
go Maroons.
This game puts the team’s 
total record at 7–1–2 for the 
season.
The game was score-
less for the ?rst half, as both 
teams put up strong defens-
es. The Tartans and Maroons 
combined for 13 attempted 
shots in the ?rst half, but 
none that would test either 
goalie.
The Tartans’ strong of-
fense was led by sophomore 
forward Savina Reid. At the 
57-minute mark, Reid — as-
sisted by ?rst-year forward 
Louisa Pendergast — kicked 
the ball past Maroons ?rst-
year goalie Jacinda Reid to 
put the Tartans on the board. 
Soon after, Reid scored again 
with an assist from junior de-
fender Brittany Couture. This 
goal marked her fourth of the 
season.
The Tartans kept their 
two-goal lead until the 
87-minute mark, when Ma-
roons forward Natalia Jo-
vanovic scored a goal. The 
Tartans fought hard during 
the ?nal three minutes of the 
game and were able to with-
stand University of Chicago’s 
pressure.
Carnegie Mellon will have 
a busy week with two home 
games, as the women’s soc-
cer team takes on University 
of Rochester Friday at 5 p.m. 
and Case Western Reserve 
University Sunday at 11 a.m. 
The Tartans look to redeem 
last season’s loss to the Case 
Western Spartans, who beat 
the Tartans 2–0.
“It feels so good to get 
our ?rst UAA win. We really 
played together as a team and 
worked well to get the win. I 
have con?dence going into 
our games,” senior mid?elder 
Stephanie Hare said.
Women’s soccer defeats Maroons
Crew competes at Regatta

The No. 4-ranked men’s 
soccer team started University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
conference play. Last Sunday 
the team defeated the visiting 
Washington University of St. 
Louis Bears, and on Saturday 
tied with the University of 
Chicago Maroons. The team’s 
record is 8–1–1 overall and 
1–0–1 in the UAA.
In the 1–0 victory against 
the Bears, the winning goal 
was assisted by a free kick 
from senior Ben Bryant to ju-
nior Max Tassano, who tipped 
a header into the left corner 
of the goal. Tartan defense, 
including central defenders 
Alex Abedian and Jakob Ro-
hwer and outside backs Bran-
don Peck and Bryant, deterred 
the Bears from not only scor-
ing, but shooting as well — 
the Bears had only three shots 
throughout the game.
When the Tartans faced 
its second UAA opponent, 
the University of Chicago Ma-
roons, the game resulted in a 
double overtime draw. The 
Maroons were leading the 
game 2–0 throughout most 
of the second half, until ju-
nior mid?elder Chris Wysocki 
scored his ?rst goal of the sea-
son, changing the score to 2–1 
with 22 minutes remaining in 
the game.
Bryant tied the game with 
1:46 remaining by scoring the 
second goal for Carnegie Mel-
lon, which resulted from a vol-
ley from the top of the 18-yard 
box to the corner of the goal.
“The goal was one of the 
best goals I’ve scored in my 
life,” Bryant said. “It was a vol-
ley out of the air with my left 
foot, and once it went in we all 
felt a sense of relief.”
Early in the ?rst overtime, 
Bryant had a shot blocked, 
and near the 95-minute mark, 
a header by junior defender 
Cole Christensen was too wide 
for completion. In the second 
overtime the Tartans did not 
take any shots, but the Ma-
roons were able to grab two. 
The ?rst of shot was too wide; 
the other was saved by junior 
goalkeeper Christopher Mad-
den with less than two min-
utes to go.
The Tartans continue to 
compete in the UAA, and will 
face University of Rochester at 
home on Friday at 7:30 p.m.
Men’s tennis has rough day
Men’s soccer comes from behind to win

The Carnegie Mellon club 
rowing team participated in 
the Head of the Ohio Regatta 
in Downtown on Saturday. 
Colleges from all over the 
country, in addition to lo-
cal high school students and 
adults, competed on the Ohio 
River.
“It was exciting to race 
along downtown Pittsburgh,” 
junior Lauren Ruoff said.
It was a celebration of the 
crew club’s 25th anniversary, 
and many alumni traveled 
back to Pittsburgh to support 
the club and participate in 
the races.
The men’s lightweight four 
placed second and took home 
a silver medal in the event. 
The team was led by sopho-
more coxswain Jenna Krug, 
and consisted of sophomore 
Sam Winslow, junior Damien 
Engels, senior Brendan White, 
and senior Dmitriy Yakubov.
The men’s eight boat, led 
by junior coxswain Rand 
Burzese, ?nished ?fth out of 
16 boats. Rowers included 
juniors Luke Diorio-Toth and 
Joe Guihan, senior Faiz Abba-
si, sophomore Bryan Phippps, 
senior Alex Shie, Yakubov, 
Winslow, and Engels.
The women’s lightweight 
four, commanded by junior 
coxswain Isaac Jones, took 
third place in the event due 
to the hard efforts of sopho-
more Julia Embody, ?rst-year 
Kelsey Simpson, and juniors 
Katy Basore and Jinie Haytko.
“The water was really 
choppy, but I think that was 
almost a good thing because it 
made us really focus on row-
ing with our best form, so that 
downstream where the water 
was calmer, we were able to 
row even better,” junior Karl 
DeStefano said.
The Tartans’ next race will 
be the Head of the Occoquan 
in Sandy Run, Va., on Nov. 
3–4.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s tennis team left campus 
on Sept. 28 for the annual, 
weekend-long ITA Southeast 
Regional Championships, 
hosted by the University of 
Mary Washington. Histori-
cally, the Tartans have been 
able to send some players to 
nationals. This year, the Tar-
tans broke that trend.
Top-seeded senior Duke 
Miller fell to No. 9-seeded 
Erik Lim of Johns Hopkins 
University in three sets, 2–6, 
6–4, and 6–3, in the round 
of 16. First-year and No. 
9-seeded Abhishek Alla made 
it all the way to quarter?nals 
before losing to No. 1-seeded 
Andy Hersh of Johns Hop-
kins University, 6–2 and 6–0. 
Hersh had also defeated Tar-
tan ?rst-year Yuvraj Kumar in 
the round of 16.
No. 9-seeded sophomore 
Christian Heaney-Secord 
sailed to the round of 16 be-
fore being defeated by the No. 
5-seeded Ben Hwang of Johns 
Hopkins University.
Miller and sophomore 
William Duncan went into 
the doubles draw as the 
No. 1 seeds. Miller and Dun-
can made a run to the semi?-
nals before they were upset by 
No. 4-seeded Hersh and Jeff 
Kamei from Johns Hopkins, 
8–5.
Carnegie Mellon had many 
quarter?nal ?nishers. The 
No. 5-seeded team was a new 
look for Carnegie Mellon as 
Heaney-Secord and ?rst-year 
Kosuke Hasegawa paired up 
for the ?rst time.
The duo fell to the 
No. 2-seeded team of Evan 
Chalres and Donato Rizzolo 
from the University of Mary 
Washington, 8–5.
Another new team for the 
Tartans was tandem of Alla 
and sophomore Bryce Beiss-
wanger.
Unseeded Alla and Beiss-
wanger defeated the No. 
3-seeded duo of Will MacAr-
thur and Ross Silverberg of 
Franklin and Marshall Col-
lege in the ?rst round and 
then moved on to have a swift 
second-round win over Alex 
Haley and Michael Milanov of 
Shenandoah University, 8–1. 
However, the new pair fell to 
the No. 5-seeded duo of Tan-
ner Brown and Erik Lim of 
Johns Hopkins University in a 
close 9–7 pro set, taking it set 
to a tie-breaking game.
“We learned a lot about 
ourselves over the weekend,” 
said head coach Andrew Gi-
rard. “We learned that we are 
capable of some great things 
this season, but also discov-
ered some areas we need 
to improve in if we want to 
compete for a national cham-
pionship next spring. This 
is de?nitely the most depth 
we’ve had in both singles 
and doubles in a long time, 
maybe ever. I’m looking for-
ward to putting all of our tal-
ents together in a dual match 
format.”

Tartan volleyball struggles at UAA Round Robin No. 1
SARA GUO
Junior Staffwriter
The Tartan volleyball team 
traveled to the University of 
Chicago Sept. 29 and 30 to 
play in the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Round 
Robin No. 1.
“It wasn’t really a great 
weekend, but that’s expected 
with [the] UAA,” sophomore 
right side hitter Ali Celentano 
said. “A lot of the teams are 
top, nationally ranked teams, 
and we started out with two 
of the top teams in the confer-
ence.”
Their ?rst match was 
against host University of Chi-
cago, ranked No. 14, which 
swept the Tartans 3–0 (25–
14, 25–16, 29–27). Celentano 
had seven kills, and junior 
outside hitter Senna Parsa 
had six kills and two block as-
sists. Junior libero Ali Nichols 
led the team with 13 digs.
“I was most proud of how 
we played in the third set 
against Chicago,” junior setter 
Emily Wright said. “We gave a 
good showing and Chicago 
did not win easily. The game 
could have gone either way.”
The team’s next match was 
against sixth-ranked Emory 
University Eagles. The Tartans 
fell to the Eagles 3–0 in three 
quick games (25–10, 25–13, 
25–18). Celentano collected 
10 kills, and ?rst-year setter 
Emily Lawlis had 14 assists.
“We need to buckle down 
on our serve receive,” head 
coach Kim Kelly said. “[Em-
ory] ran quite a few serves 
off of us in one segment, and 
we just couldn’t recover from 
that. They ran a very fast of-
fense, and we have to catch up 
to that offense.”
The Tartans faced New 
York University for its ?nal 
match of the Round Robin No. 
1. Although Carnegie Mellon 
won the ?rst game (25–18), 
New York University won the 
overall match 3–1 (25–22, 
25–15, 25–17). Parsa tal-
lied 11 kills, 11 digs, and two 
block assists, while Nichols 
led the defense with 21 digs.
“This past weekend did not 
go how we would have liked,” 
Wright said. “However, it was 
de?nitely an eye opener for 
us, and it taught us a lot about 
how we function as a team. 
Luckily we have two more 
weeks to work hard and pre-
pare for our next UAA tourna-
ment.”
Carnegie Mellon will host 
the UAA Round Robin No. 2 
this weekend, where the Tar-
tans will play the University of 
Rochester, Case Western Re-
serve University, Washington 
University in St. Louis, and 
Brandeis University.

Tartan football the victor at Cancer Awareness Game
ADAM GRUBER
Sports Co-Editor
The Tartans won the Cin-
dy Lackner Memorial Foot-
ball Game 41–21. 
Football fans dressed in 
pink to honor the late wife of 
head coach Rick Lackner and 
to support ?nding a cure for 
breast cancer at the team’s 
home game against the Deni-
son University Big Red on 
Saturday.
“It was great to be able 
to dedicate this game to 
coach’s wife and come with a 
win,” senior cornerback Sam 
Thompson said.
Junior quarterback Rob 
Kalkstein had a fantastic 
game, completing 10 of his 
14 passes for 186 yards and a 
touchdown.
While most of Kalkstein’s 
passes were pinpoint accu-
rate, a few of them required 
dif?cult catches from his 
receivers, including a 41-
yard completion to junior 
receiver Tim Kikta at the end 
of the third period. Kikta ran 
a corner route and beat his 
defender, but the throw was 
off line. Kikta adjusted and 
caught the ball just a couple 
inches off the ground before 
diving onto the turf.
Kikta had just two recep-
tions in the game, but both 
had big gains as he recorded 
a total of 96 receiving yards.
Senior running back Pat-
rick Blanks was dominant 
in the running game, car-
rying the ball 14 times for a 
whopping 155 yards, aver-
aging 11.1 yards per carry. 
He found the end zone three 
times in the game. Junior 
running back Michael Tren-
talange added a touchdown 
of his own.
Statistically, the two of-
fenses performed evenly. The 
Tartans’ 427 yards of total of-
fense was almost matched by 
the Big Red’s 394 yards.
The difference in this 
game was ball security. The 
Tartans committed zero 
turnovers, recovering their 
only fumble of the game. 
However, Denison University 
threw two interceptions and 
fumbled the football three 
times, losing possession on 
two of them. The Big Red also 
lost the ball on downs twice, 
while the Tartans converted 
two fourth down plays for the 
?rst.
“Our defense gave up a lot 
of yards, so forcing turnovers 
was critical to stopping the 
Big Red offense,” Thompson 
said.
Junior inside linebacker 
Akwasi Brefo led the Tartans’ 
defense with nine tackles. Ju-
nior safeties Jack Butler and 
Alex Basinski added seven 
tackles each. The Tartans’ 
defensive line gave Denison 
senior quarterback Max Pau-
lus a headache, sacking him 
six times. Kalkstein was well-
protected in this game; he 
was only sacked once.
The 5–1 Tartans will face 
the Ohio Wesleyan University 
Battling Bishops next Satur-
day at home. Kickoff is at 1 
p.m. at Gesling Stadium.

The Carnegie Mellon golf 
team ?nished another tour-
nament in the top ?ve. On 
Sept. 29 and 30, the Tartans 
traveled to the Cedarbrook 
Golf Course in Belle Vernon, 
Penn. The Vulcan Invitation-
al was hosted by California 
University of Pennsylvania, a 
Division-II school.
The Tartans managed to 
stay in the zone for two days 
and ?nished ?fth out of 16 
teams.
The Vulcan Invitational 
was a three-round tourna-
ment. Each of the ?ve com-
peting Tartans completed all 
three rounds, and the four 
best scores were used to cal-
culate the ?nal score for the 
round. Junior Ian Bangor, 
sophomore Cameron Low, 
?rst-year Ben DuCarme, 
sophomore Justin Fischler, 
and junior Grant Strimel 
competed for Carnegie Mel-
lon.
In the ?rst round, the Tar-
tans’ best score was 69 from 
Bangor and DuCarme. Ban-
gor had the lowest score of 
any of his teammates across 
all three rounds; in the sec-
ond round, he shot another 
69 and completed the third 
round with a 73, for a grand 
total of 211 for all three 
rounds.
Low had the next best to-
tal of 224, shooting rounds of 
72, 75, and 77, respectively.
“Future goals de?nitely 
include making it to nation-
als as a team. I de?nitely 
believe in the team we have 
this year to make it there. 
We have shown this fall sea-
son so far that we can put up 
the necessary scores to make 
it to nationals, and we have 
the talent to go very far,” Low 
said. “It’s just a matter of us 
playing consistently well 
throughout this year. We are 
a young team, so if we cannot 
make it to nationals this year, 
next year looks very promis-
ing.”
The Tartans will host the 
Carnegie Mellon Fall Invita-
tional at Longue Vue Country 
Club Thursday morning.

ATHLETE PROFILE
Ali Celentano leads volleyball offensive
SARA GUO
Junior Staffwriter
Sophomore right side hit-
ter Ali Celentano currently 
leads the volleyball team with 
a total of 218 kills and an aver-
age of 3.03 kills per game. She 
also has the highest hitting 
percentage on the team with 
.278.
Her success on the court 
began when she was a fresh-
man in high school.
“There was a new high 
school [volleyball] team, so 
I decided I was just going to 
try out even though I’d never 
played before,” Celentano 
said. “People said, ‘You’re tall 
so you should try to play vol-
leyball.’ So I did, and the high 
school coach convinced me to 
play club, and then from there 
I just fell in love with it.”
Her passion for volley-
ball is evident on the court. 
Sometimes she arrives early to 
practice to set up the nets and 
get in extra repetitions. Head 
coach Kim Kelly acknowl-
edges and appreciates Celen-
tano’s work ethic.
“She works hard,” Kelly 
said. “Any time she feels like 
she has to improve on some-
thing, she’s asked me to come 
in early, she’s asked me to stay 
late. She wants to be the best 
that she can possibly be, and I 
love that.”
Celentano also brings a 
positive attitude to the team, 
and Kelly believes a positive 
outlook is essential to over-
coming obstacles in the sport.
“She always has a smile no 
matter what,” Kelly said. “Ali 
is very positive out there. That 
helps a lot, because if we have 
a player who is down on her-
self, she looks to Ali and sees 
that smile to bring her up.”
Junior setter Emily Wright 
also notices Celentano’s in-
credible presence on the court 
and positive in?uence on the 
team.
“Ali’s biggest strength 
is de?nitely her attitude,” 
Wright said. “She brings ev-
eryone up with her and is al-
ways a positive inspiration. 
She’s a hard worker; she never 
complains and always has a 
good attitude. Most impor-
tantly, I know she will always 
get a good hit off of whatever 
set I give her. She’s a very 
adaptable player.”
Although Celentano does 
not lead her teammates vo-
cally, she leads by example. 
She knows what her role is on 
the team and tries to always 
execute it well.
“I’m not a big speaker or 
talker,” Celentano said. “I 
try to lead the team by get-
ting that kill when we need 
it. I don’t often have the right 
thing to say, so I just do what 
needs to be done.”
Celentano was named 
the Eastern College Athletic 
Conference South Volleyball 
Athlete of the Week after her 
performance in the Carnegie 
Mellon Invitational, which 
took place Sept. 14-15. During 
that weekend, Celentano hit 
.875 against the University of 
Pittsburgh at Greensburg and 
collected 17 kills against El-
mira College.
“She just had a fantastic 
week,” Kelly said. “She was 
picked out of hundreds of 
volleyball players to get that 
honor. She deserved it, there’s 
no doubt about it. She worked 
her tail off that week.”
She will be looked at to 
lead on offense as the Tartans 
continue UAA Round Robin 
play next weekend.
Celentano excels both 
on and off the court. She is 
majoring in business admin-
istration, but she is working 
toward becoming a doctor 
someday. 
“She is such a determined 
young woman,” Kelly said. 
“She is going to be very suc-
cessful in whatever she de-
cides to do.”

The women’s tennis team 
dominated Oberlin College 
on Friday, winning eight of 
its nine matches. Luckily, the 
weather channel was wrong 
and the rain held off. The 
day proved to be the perfect 
weather for tennis; it was 70 
degrees and partly cloudy by 
the time the Tartans took to 
the court. Carnegie Mellon 
won all six singles matches 
and took two of the three 
doubles matches at the team’s 
last match of the fall season.
Senior Alex Tapak and 
sophomore Lydia Utkin held 
?rst-years Ariana Abayomi 
and Erin Johnson of Oberlin 
scoreless, winning 8–0 at No. 
3 doubles. Sophomores Chel-
sea Motie and Bryn Raschke 
followed that victory up with 
an 8–3 win at No. 1 doubles. 
Motie also won Carnegie Mel-
lon’s ?rst singles match in two 
sets  6–0, 6–2 at No. 3 singles.
Sophomore Angela Pratt 
won her match in two sets  
6–2, 6–4 at No. 5 singles. Ut-
kin won at No. 6 singles 6–4, 
6–2.
“It was great to ?nish the 
season with a solid win. We 
played really well as a team 
and our result was evidence 
of it,” Utkin said.
The Tartans were, for 
the most part, unchallenged 
by Oberlin. Very few of the 
matches were close, and only 
one match went to a third set. 
The doubles matches were 
all pro-sets, with the Tartans 
winning two of them handily.
The lost pro-set was at the 
hands of the Oberlin duo, 
junior Brenna Sheldon and 
senior Preeya Shah. They 
defeated Pratt and ?rst-year 
Brooke Tsu, 8–4.
The other singles victors 
included ?rst-years Abbey 
Hamstra and Elizabeth Mar-
tin. Junior Katie Cecil also 
won her singles match at No. 
1 singles, 7–6 and 6–2.
“Oberlin came out strong 
on Friday and I was really 
happy with how everyone 
stayed mentally tough to end 
our fall season on a good note. 
Hopefully it will carry over 
into the spring season,” Cecil 
said.
 In singles matches, Shel-
don was the only potential ad-
versary to the Tartans’ victory, 
as her match against Martin 
went into three sets, with 
Martin eventually winning.
“I’m really excited about 
yesterday’s results, but also 
disappointed that yesterday 
was the last match of the fall 
season,” Martin said. “I can’t 
wait for the spring season!”
The women’s tennis sea-
son will begin again in the 
spring semester.

Hunt exhibit mesmerizes
Portraits of a Garden explores tradition of ?orilegium
For most people, plants are simply part of the 
background of everyday life. But for certain artists, 
there is a whole other realm among arched petals 
and verdant leaves.
The exhibit Portraits of a Garden, a collection of 
botanical illustrations from the Brooklyn Botanical 
Gardens (BBG) Florilegium, provides an intimate 
glimpse into the entrancing world of flora. The Hunt 
Institute for Botanical Documentation, located on the 
fifth floor of Hunt Library, has been home to works 
from over 48 American botanical artists on loan from 
the BBG’s permanent collection, along with never-
before-exhibited historical volumes from the Hunt 
Institute’s own collection.
The BBG is one of the few botanical gardens that 
houses a florilegium, a compilation of handcrafted 
illustrations of the plants kept there. The florilegium 
is a tradition that dates back centuries: The height 
of its popularity was in the 17th century, when rare 
and exotic plants discovered on global expeditions 
were first introduced to European gardens. The 
wealthy owners of these gardens would then 
commission artists to produce illustrations of the 
plants they had collected.
Recently, modern botanical gardens have revived 
interest in florilegium, especially in the case of 
rare or endangered plants. Lugene Bruno, the 
curator of art for the Hunt Institute, emphasized the 
importance of such practices: “These plants could 
disappear any number of years from now. We need 
to keep records of what plants are being grown for 
hortological and medicinal reasons.”
Portraits of a Garden displays illustrations of only 
some of the several thousand plants that reside in 
the BBG, but even this small sampling of flowers, 
ferns, and trees is incredibly diverse. The exhibit 
showcases plants from all around the world, in 
a variety of colors and shapes. Among them are 
ferns that resemble the tail feathers of an ostrich 
and plants that look like they belong in a surrealist 
painting rather than in the real world.
Equally as fascinating as the subject matter is the 
artistic talent behind the florilegium. The sheer 
technical brilliance of the works is staggering. 
Whether in vibrant watercolor, crisp lines of ink, or 
careful strokes of pencil, each of the pieces not only 
painstakingly recreates each vein and fiber of its 
subject, but also radiates an inherent personality 
that the artist bestows upon them. For instance, 
Carol Hamilton’s triptych of an apricot branch 
conveys a zen-like sense of serenity, while Margaret 
Farr’s cherry blossoms idyllically float in everlasting 
spring.
“These artists are calling attention to the plant, 
their history, and how they’re used,” Bruno said of 
the artists. “They’re getting people to pay closer 
attention to the world around them.” Truly, the 
power of the exhibit lies not only in its ability to 
introduce its audience to a whole new world, but 
also to imbue them with a sense of appreciation for 
the world already around them.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I’ve been playing the 
whole interview game 
for weeks now, and I’m 
exhausted. “What did 
you do at your job last 
summer?” “What exactly 
are you willing to do for 
this job, if you catch my 
drift?” “Can I get your 
personal number?” These 
recruiters are really 
aggressive, and flying off 
to all these interviews 
is leaving me seriously 
jetlagged! What can I do?
Thanks,

Dear JOB HUNTED,
You don’t have a problem, 
you’re just bragging. “Boo 
hoo, so many companies 
want to hire me. Whatever 
will I do?” Give me a break. 
You don’t have to take 
these interviews — you like 
the attention. Go ahead 
and enjoy it while you can, 
but don’t go rubbing it in 
everyone else’s faces.
If these interviews are 
really so taxing for you, 
then actually start turning 
them down. It’s college 
applications all over again 
— keep interviewing with 
your top choices, but keep 
a couple of safeties in your 
back pocket in case you get 
rejected. Or do what I did 
and just apply to one place. 
You’ll probably be fine. Or 
living back home with your 
parents.
No one likes your first-
world problem,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
That guy who wrote the 
other letter sucks. I’ve 
had my résumé out there 
for months, and I haven’t 
had any bites. I would 
kill to be hounded by 
recruiters. What can I do 
to get some interviews 
going?

Dear REJECTED,
Glad to hear you have an 
actual problem, unlike that 
other jerk. He’s like the 
hot chick at the party, and 
you’re the quiet girl in the 
corner at the beginning 
of every ’80s high school 
comedy. You need the same 
solution: makeover montage! 
Just pop in your earbuds, 
assemble your ’80s pop 
music playlist, and head over 
to the Career Center. They 
are actually paid to get you 
a job.
But remember that jobs 
are like trains: At the end of 
the night, you gotta hop on 
the last one coming by. We 
can’t all work for Google. 
Be grateful for whatever 
work you can get, because 
there are people out there 
with families to support that 
would love a job. Don’t turn 
down a job because it’s not 
“good enough.” If it pays, it’s 
good.
Your parents don’t want 
you back home either,
Patrick Hoskins

When one thinks of Tim Burton, a few things come to 
mind: Dark themes, stop motion animation, and Johnny 
Depp. Burton’s newest ?lm — released last month — 
brings two of those to the screen, but leaves Depp at 
home.
  
Frankenweenie is the story of a boy and his dog, with a 
monster-movie twist. The ?lm opens with the shockingly 
normal Frankenstein family watching a short ?lm young 
Victor has made starring his dog Sparky, who saves the 
day from a monster attacking the town. His parents are 
impressed, but they worry Victor’s introverted nature 
will have a negative effect on his development. They 
make him join a baseball league so he will interact with 
his peers. However, after Victor hits an unlikely home 
run, Sparky is tragically struck by a car while chasing 
the home run ball. Victor is inconsolable, until he 
learns about the wonderful effects of electricity on the 
nervous system from his science teacher at New Holland 
Elementary.
In many ways, Frankenweenie is a homage to the 
monster-movie genre. The town of New Holland, 
complete with a Hollywood-esque sign and an old 
fashioned wooden windmill, is home to a number of freak 
lightning strikes and strange characters. The girl next 
door is named Elsa Van Helsing, and a few of Victor’s 
classmates look like Frankenstein, a hunchback, and 
Wednesday Addams. Burton even gives Elsa’s dog a 
hairdo that would make the bride of Frankenstein proud. 
These sorts of references take Frankenweenie beyond 
the genre of a children’s movie and make it enjoyable for 
a wider audience.
While Frankenweenie succeeds as a source of 
entertainment, there are implications at several stages of 
the movie about the ethics of scienti?c experimentation 
and the state of science education. For example, after 
it has come to light that Victor reanimated Sparky, the 
parents of the New Holland community rise up against 
Mr. Rzykruski, the children’s science teacher. When he 
is allowed to defend himself, Mr. Rzykruski condemns 
the parents for being ignorant of science and writing it 
off as magic just because they do not understand how 
it works. This is a one-off encounter of the theme of 
education that could have played a much larger role in 
the resolution of the story.
Frankenweenie is an adaptation of an earlier project 
Burton did for Disney, but it was reworked into his 
trademark stop motion animation style. In terms 
of the animation, Burton’s reputation for excellent 
cinematography holds true for Frankenweenie, the ?rst 
black-and-white feature ?lm to be released in IMAX. 
Although some scenes could have been enhanced with 
3-D technology, there is no point at which it seems 
essential to the story. It is easy to see Burton’s love of 
tall, skinny characters in all of his works, as the actual 
animation in Frankenweenie bears a strong resemblance 
to that of Corpse Bride.
The humorous references to iconic monster movies 
as well as the emotional content of the story work 
together wonderfully to add another classic to Burton’s 
?lmography.

Looper, released in theaters Sept. 28, does the seemingly 
impossible: It sidesteps the usual problems of time 
travel movies and focuses instead on character. Directed 
by Rian Johnson, the ?lm uses time travel as a tool 
throughout the story.
The ?lm is set in the year 2044, when economic collapse 
has led to a wave of organized crime. Joe Simmons, 
played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a member of a group 
of killers called “loopers,” which uses time travel to target 
its victims. The futuristic science ?ction tale follows 
Simmons as he tries to track down his older self, played 
by Bruce Willis.
The movie handles time travel, dicey in the best of 
circumstances, with grace and humor. Instead of trying 
to explain the mechanics of something impossible, 
Johnson merely has the characters gloss over the ?ner 
points. This choice allows the audience to focus on the 
story and characters instead of getting bogged down by 
the nitty-gritty details of time travel theory; this is where 
Johnson shines in the movie.
Johnson shows real strength as a writer and director 
through his characters, especially through Simmons. 
Simmons is a romantically misunderstood hero; he is 
the type of character that Hollywood rarely laughs at, 
but Johnson isn’t afraid to portray him as endearingly 
incompetent. At one point, Simmons’ older self knocks 
out his younger self with a comically weak punch. 
Simmons is also rescued by a ?ve-year-old twice.
Johnson’s light portrayal of Simmons is as amusing 
as it is refreshing, and this actually helps the time 
travel angle. Simmons is not the same as his older self; 
although they are the same person, older Simmons is 
more experienced than is his younger self. Younger 
Simmons’ occasional incompetency helps show that 
time travel has created two people who share the same 
memories, but that they are not the same person.
However, some of Johnson’s other characters lack 
the same freshness. Speci?cally, most of his female 
characters — there are only three in the entire movie — 
are stilted and unrealistic. Among them are a showgirl/
prostitute and older Simmons’ wife, who looks entirely 
too young to be making out with Willis, and who literally 
never speaks.
The third is Sara, played by Emily Blunt. Of the three, 
Blunt’s character is the most well-developed. Sara’s 
relationship with younger Simmons is reasonably 
well-articulated, though the sexual relationship that 
inevitably develops has almost no real basis. Johnson 
leans on the typical Hollywood expectation that the 
beautiful boy and the beautiful girl, having been within 
10 feet of each other, will obviously have sex. Given the 
strength of characterization of Simmons and his older 
self, this use of cliché is disappointing.
Although these problems of character have a negative 
impact on the plot, the movie is fantastically well done 
overall. Time travel is a storytelling tool, not a major focus 
of the movie, and the two main characters are fresh and 
interesting. Johnson takes a complex and convoluted 
story and tells it in a simple and extremely entertaining 
way.

The Rivals proves that humor is timeless
School of Drama production amuses audiences with centuries-old slapstick, wordplay
Wordplay, slapstick, intricate costumes, a great cast — 
the School of Drama’s current production, The Rivals, 
has a lot to offer audiences. Although the show was 
written in 1775 and is set in Bath, England, the audience 
is still able to follow the story and appreciate the jokes 
scattered throughout the dialogue.
The show follows the dramatic Lydia Languish, played 
by senior acting major Ginna Le Vine, on her quest for 
love and marriage. Plot twists involving the pursuit of 
love plague all members of the cast, as The Rivals is full 
of deceit, intense emotion, and confusion at every turn.
Wordplay is one of the funniest parts of the show, easily 
causing the audience to forget that the play was written 
over 200 years ago. The old Mrs. Malaprop, played 
by senior acting major Alexandra Spieth, is obsessed 
with proper speech, yet incorrectly uses sophisticated 
words throughout the play. Her use of “pineapple” for 
“pinnacle” and “perpendicular” for “particular” kept the 
audience in stitches.
The show is also full of slapstick. In one scene, Mrs. 
Malaprop repeatedly strikes Lydia on the head when the 
older woman is particularly annoyed with the younger 
lady’s insolence. Bob Acres, played by senior musical 
theater major Joseph Maddox, also provides a lot of 
comic relief through his constant threats of violence, 
which included punching the air, gnashing his teeth, 
and working himself into an excited frenzy. “The Fag,” 
played by senior acting major Jacob Tischler, receives 
constant physical and emotional abuse from his master 
and others, providing some good laughs.
“I am delighted to come to Carnegie Mellon University 
to direct one of my favorite plays,” director Annie Tyson 
said in a university press release. “It is almost a perfect 
play in that it has a real balance of witty high comedy 
with a slightly darker underbelly.” Tyson, a visiting 
director, actor, and teacher from England, also performed 
in the play in the 1980s and was a visiting lecturer at 
Carnegie Mellon from 2005 to 2007.
The cast of the show worked well together. The romantic 
connection between Julia Melville, played by senior 
acting major Grace Rao, and Faulkland, played by senior 
musical theater major Jon Jorgenson, provides a nice 
dynamic in contrast to Lydia’s unending drama. The 
show also includes monologues in which actors directly 
address the audience. These longer, individual moments 
allow the actors to express their interpretations of the 
characters and to showcase their talents.
The costumes in the show are intricate, from the 
hairpieces and jewelry to the shoes that each actor 
wears. In an article on the School of Drama’s website, 
associate professor of costume production Brian 
Russman commented on the authenticity of the 
female costumes. He noted that the school’s costume 
production students “are making the dresses from the 
skin out, which includes the proper undergarments for 
the period like corsets, petticoats, and the appropriate 
wigs, as well as the trims on the dresses that fashionable 
ladies of the time would have worn.”
Such attention to detail added to the atmosphere 
created onstage, especially since very few props were 
used — never much more than a table, a chair or two, 
and a tray with drinks. The costumes evoked a sense of 
period for the audience. Lydia’s costume, in particular, 
complemented her ditsy demeanor — it was frilly, pink, 
and topped off with pearls and a head of curls.
The show’s program includes plenty of useful 
information about the period in which the play was 
written, as well as insights that make the play even 
funnier. Mrs. Malaprop’s name is a play on a French 
phrase mal à propos, which translates to “out of place” 
or “inappropriate” — ?tting, considering her continued 
misuse of words. Bob Acres’ name is a reference to the 
land, since he is the only character to come from the 
country and is presumed to be of a lower class than his 
fellow men.
Audience reactions to the show were positive. Laughter 
could be heard throughout the show in response to Mrs. 
Malaprop’s misuse of words, Bob Acres’ frenzies about 
getting into a ?ght, and Lydia’s shrieking and shouting. 
The combination of different overlapping plot lines 
culminates in an ending that ties up all the loose ends 
and gives the audience resolution about what happens 
next for all of the characters. Another nice touch to the 
very end of the play is a period-style dance that the 
entire cast performs together.
Although the play runs over three hours long, it is well 
worth making time to see and is sure to provide plenty 
of laughs.

The halls were alive with the sound of music for two 
hours on Saturday night, as students and their families 
were swept up by A CaPittsburgh.
Organized by the all-female a cappella group 
Counterpoint, the event is an annual charity concert 
that channels the musical talent of collegiate a cappella 
groups toward a good cause. All six of Carnegie Mellon’s 
on-campus groups — Soundbytes, Deewane, The 
Originals, Joyful Noise, Treblemakers, and Counterpoint 
— performed, and this year they were joined by C Flat 
Run, a group from the University of Pittsburgh.
The event has been a staple of the Cèilidh Weekend 
celebrations since 2008, according to Counterpoint 
president Ellen Obenshain, a senior civil engineering 
major. “Counterpoint always organizes the event, and 
this year, since I was president, it was my job. Maggie 
Bignell was a huge help as well,” Obenshain said. “It’s 
easy to have this event during the Cèilidh celebration 
because ?rst of all, it’s a great event for families, and 
secondly, it’s easy to schedule because so much else is 
already happening.”
According to Maggie Bignell, junior design major and 
Counterpoint’s public relations chair, the event normally 
has a theme and one charity, but this year, three 
organizations bene?ted.
“The theme this year is ‘Music is Universal,’ ” Obenshain 
said. “We decided on three different charities to donate 
the proceeds to instead of just one.” The three charities 
this year were Playing For Change Foundation, Mr. 
Holland’s Opus Fund, and Sonic Peacemakers. These 
charities each emphasize music in a different way and 
location, according to Obenshain.
The concert was spirited and fun — the perfect event 
for families who were visiting and for students catcalling 
their friends onstage. Rangos Hall was packed for the 
event, with students standing along the rear and sides 
of the room. After a phenomenal opening of a Sara 
Bareilles medley performed by Counterpoint, Soundbytes 
took the stage to whirl through a set that exhibited 
an incredible amount of soul and some intense female 
solos. The power and lung capacity with which the 
Soundbytes sang — or, more aptly, belted — was beyond 
imagination, setting the bar high for the rest of the 
performers.
The second group was the all-male, South Asian group 
Deewane. Starting off with a remix of One Direction’s 
“What Makes You Beautiful” and then redeeming 
themselves in the eyes of hipsters with a remix of 
Coldplay’s “Fix You,” the group showcased once again 
its aptitude and ?air for blending not only songs, but also 
cultures. The songs were appropriately energizing and 
calming, and the pitches were positively heavenly.
Following Deewane was University of Pittsburgh’s C Flat 
Run, whose highlight piece was “Little Lion Man” by 
Mumford and Sons. The piece was adapted ?awlessly, 
and the soloist’s reedy voice suited the song perfectly.
After an intermission, The Originals took the stage to 
wild catcalls and cheering. Staying true to their motto 
of featuring anything that they can make sound good, 
The Originals did indeed rock their blue ties in Ellie 
Goulding’s “Lights.”
Joyful Noise followed The Originals with a witty intro 
and three songs that took the audience on a spiritual 
journey: Katy Perry’s “Wide Awake” expressed a sense of 
brokenness, while the next two evoked joy and salvation. 
The group possessed an incredible amount of energy 
and passion for its mission, which was evident to the 
audience.
The Treblemakers were as energetic as ever, ?nishing 
their set with fun.’s recent No. 1 song “Some Nights.” 
The rendition was enthusiastic and soulful, emulating 
the pure joy of singing to share a story with the world.
Wrapping up the wonderful evening was Counterpoint, 
taking the stage once again to perform its set, which 
rang with emotion and happiness. Each of the groups 
put on a performance that represented its identity as a 
group and appealed to the crowd. 
Overall, the event was a smashing success, showcasing 
the creativity and raw talent of the campus not only to  
parents and visitors, but to the student body as well. 
In an environment where it’s easy to get caught up in 
studying and forget about the incredible talent of our 
peers, A CaPittsburgh was a lovely evening of refreshing 
reminders of the genius of our fellow Carnegie Mellon 
students. The fact that it was all for a good cause only 
added a shining, philanthropic vibe to the perfect 
evening.

Musical phrases danced across Kresge Theatre shortly 
before the Carnegie Mellon Wind Ensemble was 
scheduled to start, as a few performers squeezed in 
one last round of warm-ups while the audience slowly 
?lled the seats. Presented in conjunction with Cèilidh 
Weekend, the concert drew many students and their 
families last Saturday afternoon.
The concert was conducted by both George Vosburgh, 
artist lecturer in the School of Music and principal 
trumpet for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO), 
and Thomas Thompson, an associate teaching professor 
in the School of Music and co-principal clarinetist for the 
PSO.
As opposed to the standard orchestra attire of dark 
colors, the musicians sported bright pastels and radiant 
smiles as they took their places on stage. With about 
30 performers — less than half the size of a regular 
symphony orchestra — the wind ensemble certainly had 
expectations to live up to, expectations that it met as 
the concert unfolded.
The ensemble opened with composer Arnold 
Schoenberg’s “Fanfare on Motifs” from Die Gurrelieder, 
a cantata (a vocal composition involving instrumental 
accompaniment) conducted by Vosburgh. It started 
off light and catchy before it rose with a formidable 
crescendo, which made this an appropriate, attention-
grabbing opening piece that drew the audience in right 
from the beginning.
When the performers reshuf?ed to move into composer 
Charles Gounod’s Petite Symphonie, the baton was 
passed to Thompson. Petite Symphonie began on a 
somber and melodious note with its ?rst movement 
“Adagio,” before jumping into an animated “Allegro” 
movement.
The three other movements of Gounod’s nonet (a 
composition for an ensemble of nine musicians) for 
winds offered a pleasant variety of interwoven tones and 
moods, especially with its upbeat, waltz-like “Finale.” 
The harmony of the ?ute, clarinet, horn, and bassoon 
was mesmerizing.
As there was no intermission, Vosburgh took the stage 
once more, and this time, the group was noticeably 
smaller. Nevertheless, there was undoubtedly no 
change in ardor and passion as the performers launched 
into composer Robert Kurka’s The Good Soldier Schweik 
Suite. The opera on which the suite is based is set 
during World War I, when a soldier named Schweik is 
arrested for making innocuous political remarks, but is 
deemed mentally unstable and sent to an insane asylum. 
His stay is short-lived, and he volunteers for duty in 
the army, where he is passed from of?cial to of?cial. 
Eventually sent to the front, he wanders off while on 
patrol. With a storyline as rich as this, it was no wonder 
that the piece was intense.
The perfectly apt closing piece was composer Ralph 
Vaughan Williams’ Sea Songs. The musicians ?lled the 
stage as the spotlight fell on Thompson once more. Sea 
Songs, with merry melodies and an animated tempo, 
certainly left the audience feeling happy and satis?ed 
as they ?led into the Alumni Concert Hall across Kresge 
Theatre for a reception, where an array of desserts and 
drinks was served.
With pieces so pertinent to a relaxing and beautiful 
weekend, it would not be surprising that everyone 
left the Carnegie Mellon Wind Ensemble concert on a 
blissful note.

It’s hard to describe the VIA Music & New Media 
Festival without leaving out something important. Sure, 
it’s about dance parties, DJs, and visual art, but it’s also 
about collaboration, experimentation, and community 
involvement. With a week of interactive exhibits, 
concerts, and lectures, VIA is an energy and a driving 
force that is changing the city’s musical landscape.
This year was the third annual VIA Festival, going 
from last Monday and into Saturday night in various 
locations around Pittsburgh. VIA is a Pittsburgh-based, 
volunteer-run electronic music collective. It started 
its annual festival in 2010, and has since brought over 
100 musicians and 60 visual artists to the city. Over 
the summer, VIA opened its own venue at 6119 Penn 
Ave., where it has been hosting shows and creating a 
stronger presence in the community.
The VIA Festival is different from your average 
electronic music festival. According to its website, 
“VIA’s ‘Festival As Laboratory’ approach highlights 
the intersection of cutting-edge music and new media 
art through collaborative performances, installations, 
mobile projects, lectures and workshops.” Throughout 
the festival, DJs and producers are paired with visual 
artists to create unique performances. The result is an 
experience that concert-goers will not forget.
This year’s festival featured a few changes from previous 
ones. The ?rst major change was location. While still 
primarily held in East Liberty, this year’s shows were 
held at both the new 6119 space and at the abandoned 
PNC Bank building at 6000 Penn Ave. The former PNC 
building proved to be an excellent site for the festival: 
The overwhelming size of the building allowed for a 
large stage, massive dance ?oor, and full bar, making it a 
suitable counterpoint to the smaller space at 6119.
The building was out?tted with an excellent audio 
and visual system, including seven projectors that 
highlighted the visual art throughout the shows. 
Another major change — perhaps the most notable 
— was that it lasted all week, not just the weekend. 
This change allowed more time for workshops, smaller 
concerts, and interactive art exhibits.
The festival kicked off on Monday with an exhibition 
at Fe Gallery, in which 10 different artists used 3-D 
computer graphics software to create experimental 
artworks. Other interactive events included a lecture 
about the history of avant-garde cinema with Jonathan 
Walley (an associate professor of cinema at Denison 
University) and Melissa Ragona (Carnegie Mellon 
associate professor of visual culture and critical theory 
in the School of Art).
Other attractions included a demonstration of juke 
and footwork, an extremely fast dance style that grew 
out of Chicago; a Data Garden exhibit at the Center 
for PostNatural History that focused on plant-based 
generative music; and a workshop at community art 
space Assemble that featured crash courses in various 
visual programming languages.
Perhaps the most interesting interactive event was 
the pop-up arcade held at the Deeplocal studio 
space at 6101 Penn Ave. The arcade was presented 
by Babycastles, a New York City-based video game 
collective. On Friday, festival-goers were invited to 
come to the space to learn how to make their own 
fully-functioning games from low-budget materials. 
On Saturday, the arcade was open for business, 
featuring original games by Babycastles and other 
artists. Carnegie Mellon alumni Tim Sherman (CFA 
’12) and Caitlin Boyle (CFA ’12) were among those that 
created games. Their games were both housed in old 
arcade game machines, creating an authentic arcade 
experience through relatively simple games.
VIA also featured a number of performance artists 
this year — including robotcowboy, Erica Gressman, 
and Mikey McParlane — who all performed at 6119 on 
Saturday. Robotcowboy is Dan Wilcox’s performance art 
piece that combines musical performance and wearable 
computers. Wilcox, a master’s student in the School of 
Art, calls it “Human-Computer Performance.” Gressman 
and McParlane, a Carnegie Mellon alumnus (BHA ’08), 
are both performance artists based in Chicago.
Another unique event at the festival was Wednesday’s 
live rescoring of the classic French surrealist ?lm La 
Vampire Nue. The ?lm, created by Jean Rollin and 
released in 1970, examines a suicide cult led by a 
mysterious ?gure and is considered one of the most 
visually stunning erotic horror ?lms of all time. At 
the event, U.K.-based electronic musicians Demdike 
Stare rescored the ?lm live at Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ 
Melwood Screening Room. The new music ?t in 
seamlessly and creating an eerie effect.

art, interactive exhibitions, and ?lm events, its primary 
focus was still on the audiovisual performances. Starting 
on Tuesday, each night of the festival featured a diverse 
and impressive lineup of musicians and visual artists.
Tuesday’s show at The Andy Warhol Museum featured 
Los Angeles-based singer and multi-instrumentalist 
Julia Holter. Holter’s music is a hauntingly powerful 
combination of indie electronic music and modern 
composition, and her show captured the audience’s 
attention. Pittsburgh-based band The Garment District 
opened for Holter with its synth-driven ambient rock. 
The visuals for the night — provided by video artists 
Ryan Emmett, Keith Tassick, and Albert Birney —
primarily featured found footage that ?t perfectly with 
the music.
Thursday’s show opened with Toronto-based artist 
SlowPitch, who performed an impressive, yet sparse, 
set at 6119. His set never quite picked up, making him a 
perfect opener for the more dance-oriented groups that 
followed. 
SlowPitch’s set was live; he was making the music as 
he went along, not just DJing records. “It’s all about your 
energy out there,” he said at one point during his show. 
“I’m making this up on the ?y.”
The night continued with Poirier, a DJ and producer 
based in Montreal. Despite shaky transitions, his set 
was one of the best of the night, featuring a jungle vibe 
with tropical bass sounds. Poirier got people dancing 
and helped pave the way for New York City-based 
rapper Le1f. If Poirier got people dancing, Le1f really 
got the audience moving. Known for being outwardly 
gay and challenging the traditionally homophobic rap 
genre, Le1f’s music and performance style are socially 
conscious without being didactic. His stage presence 
and skillful live rapping engaged the audience in a high-
energy performance.
On Friday, New York City-based queer pop group SSION 
performed at the former PNC building. Led by singer 
Cody Critcheloe, SSION put on what was perhaps the 
most energetic and engaging show of the whole festival. 
Critcheloe’s stage presence paired with the group’s 
high-energy and highly danceable music made for an 
unforgettable show. Scott Andrews, a visual artist and 
master’s student in the College of Fine Arts, provided the 
visuals for SSION’s set, a mashup of queer symbolism 
that added to the wonderfully chaotic environment.
SSION also appeared at Carnegie Mellon’s own Skibo 
Cafe on Friday night for a special live-taping talk show.  
The event, hosted by AB Lectures, featured SSION and 
local queer celebrity host Alaska Thunderfuck.
Later on Friday night, Pittsburgh’s own Girl Talk made 
a surprise visit to the festival. Instead of performing 
his usual mashup-style set, he performed a short 
experimental noise set that was almost entirely 
comprised of bass sounds. The set was disorienting 
and confusing, with strobe lights ?ashing, Girl Talk 
out?tted in a Steeler’s jersey and helmet, and two 
masked girls throwing Arby’s roast beef sandwiches 
into the audience. Despite the general weirdness of the 
set, it was without a doubt a testament to the type of 
environment VIA creates. There are few outlets for this 
type of set, but it ?t into VIA’s lineup seamlessly.
This feeling of experimentation pervaded the week’s 
performances and activities, proving that VIA is, indeed, 
much more than a music festival. It’s an event for 
artists and concert-goers to fully immerse themselves 
in music and art without fear of rejection. The audience 
is welcoming, the artists engaging, and the week truly 
memorable.
As Holter said at her performance Tuesday night, 
perhaps most accurately summing up the entire festival: 
“I like you guys.... It’s good vibes.”

Scotch’n’Soda held its ?fth annual Charity Cabaret, 
charmingly named Sips of Scotch, in Rangos Hall 
last Friday night. They raised $1,400 from ticket 
sales, and proceeds went to the Alumni Theater 
Company, a non-pro?t organization that provides 
the opportunity for Pittsburgh youth to participate 
in the performing arts.
Will Weiner, president of Scotch’n’Soda and a senior 
economics and statistics and decision science 
double major, said that the theater group is working 
on forming a lasting relationship with the Alumni 
Theater Company, since its mission is “something 
[we] really identify with.”
Whereas many cabaret-style shows can become 
monotonous presenting act after act, Sips of Scotch 
succeeded in keeping the audience engaged from 
beginning to end. Each performer had something 
different to offer, which positively contributed to 
the show as a whole. Performances included “All 
For You” from Seussical The Musical, sung by 
sophomore decision science major Jessie Benenson; 
“Gethsemane” from Jesus Christ Superstar, sung by 
sophomore voice major Ethan Crystal; and “Gimme 
Gimme” from Thoroughly Modern Millie, sung by 
sophomore voice major Joanna Latini.
“It was actually kind of like a shotgun process,” 
said Cory Williams, a Sips of Scotch performer and 
junior information systems major, describing how 
the show was put together. Despite only having a 
couple of weeks between auditions and the show, 
as well as an extremely limited rehearsal schedule, 
the students managed to put on an excellent 
performance. The audience members praised the 
show for its variety; every performer was present 
on the stage at some point during the night. From 
dark humor to lighthearted romance and from the 
outrageously goofy to the passionately dramatic, the 
acts did well to demonstrate the theatrical and vocal 
diversity of the performers.
“Eric [Dietz], the music director, would coach them 
on their songs, and make them a little better than 
they brought them to the auditions,” said Stephen 
Murphy, the energetic accompanist of the night and 
a sophomore double majoring in piano and music 
composition. Dietz, a senior music composition 
major, organized the opening and ?nal group 
numbers, which presented amazing harmonies and 
vocal talent. Dietz was pleased with the performers, 
and said, “They did a really wonderful job.”
A group of ?ve students from the Alumni Theater 
Company opened the second act, performing 
“Seasons of Love” from Rent with impressive talent. 
The company puts a large emphasis on representing 
the lives of the youth through their shows, and also 
encourages student-written work. According to 
its website, the organization will be performing an 
original work, which opens next Friday, titled, Why 
Don’t You Come Around My Way?
Nigel Rowe, a junior voice major and Sips of Scotch 
performer, said, “It’s always a lot of fun working 
with Scotch’n’Soda,” due to the relaxed atmosphere 
and camaraderie among members. It was apparent 
through the performances that the students were 
enjoying themselves, which transferred to the 
enjoyment of the audience. Scotch’n’Soda did 
well to kick off its 75th anniversary year with this 
musical performance.
