Varsity Make It Five Straight.
Hines entered his name on the roll 
of fame by pitching the Varsity to 
victory against Mt. Union last Satur­
day on the home field. He allowed 
but three hits and gave only one base 
on balls. Our players had no trouble 
in hitting the two Mt. Union pitch­
ers at will, and scored eight runs to 
their opponents’ two. The home 
team also gave Hines excellent sup­
port, and ran the bases well. The 
only error for the Plaid players re­
sulted in the second of the two runs 
of their opponents, but did not en­
danger the game.
Among those hitting was Capt. 
Gearhart, who garnered a two-bagger 
and two singles in four times up. He 
also set the example in the field, 
and by two brilliant performances 
broke down line drives that were 
meant for extra bases and threw the 
hitters out at first.
Wilson starred for the visitors at 
the bat. The first time up he drove 
the ball to the scoreboard and made 
the round of the bases. Fortunately 
for us, the bases were empty. In 
the third inning, after Slabaugh had 
walked, then stolen second, Wilson 
drove to deep right for two bases, 
scoring Slabaugh with the second 
run.
McClure robbed Lain of an almost 
sure three-base hit by picking a long 
fly from the side of the middle field 
bluff in the fourth. He also made a 
difficult catch of Brine’s long fly in 
the third, and stopped a possible run.
Mt. Union took the lead in the first 
on Wilson’s home run, and increased 
it to 2-0 in the third. Thereafter, un­
til the eighth, but three men in each 
session faced Hines. Buxton got on 
base in that inning on a single over 
short, but was left at first. In the 
ninth, the batsmen went down one- 
two-three.
We started our scoring in the 
fourth. Vail opened by popping up 
to McMurray. Lobert received a base 
on balls and stole second. He took 
third on a passed ball before Lain 
flied out to McClure, and scored on 
another while Gearhart was at bat. 
Geary ended by missing three.
Moorhead opened our half of the 
fourth by singling over short, and 
stole second. Brine popped up a fly 
to Wilson and Hines fouled out to 
Slabaugh. Hall hit a hot grounder to 
Buxton, who dropped the pill, and 
Moorhead went to third, with Tiny 
safe at first. Brine stole second and

First of Its Kind Held in This Part 
of the Country.
On Friday afternoon, May 9, the 
first conference of editors of stu­
dent papers was held at the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh. Not only were 
the university and college papers rep­
resented at this conference but many 
high school papers as well. This is 
a notable beginning of what should 
develop into one of the most impor­
tant conferences held in Western 
Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio.
The first session was opened by Mr. 
T. R. Williams, Instructor in Jour­
nalism, at the University of. Pitts­
burgh, who presided at the afternoon 
meeting. In the absence of Chan­
cellor S. B. McCormick, Dr. J. T. 
Holdsworth, Dean of the School of 
Economics, delivered the Address of 
Welcome, placing the University at 
the service of the delegates. The re­
mainder of the afternoon was taken 
up by discussion upon various topics 
relative to University and College 
papers. The several topics were 
opened by the Editors-in-Chief of the 
various papers represented and then 
discussed generally. Mr. Williams 
gave some very excellent suggestions 
in regards to “Some Don’ts for Stu­
dent Editors.” The discussion of 
‘What Shall be the Policy of Col­
lege Newspapers?” was opened by F. 
C. Bunting, Editor-in-Chief of “The 
Dickinsonian.” “Some General Rules 
for Writing for Student Newspapers,” 
by Donald D. Mitchell, was the third 
topic that came up for discussion.
The afternoon meeting was closed 
after a few remarks by Dr. Talcott 
Williams of the Pulitzer School of 
Journalism, Columbia University.
At the evening session, Dr. Wil­
liams and Don C. Seitz, general man­
ager of the New York “World,” de­
livered addresses upon phases of mod­
ern journalism. The theme taken by 
Mr. Seitz was “The Newspaper as 
a Business.”
“I know of no other business,” said 
he, “that requires more careful, pains­
taking, exacting work, the kind that 
admits of no sitting down. News-
Continued on page 6.
It is the intention of the Director 
to farm a large part of the land at 
Camp Louise Carnegie, and lower the 
cost of living in Pittsburgh and the 
vicinity by putting the products in 
the local markets. With this end in 
view a large amount of the tillable 
land has already been put under cul­
tivation. The director thinks that 
the land in this section of the coun­
try, if farmed scientifically, can be 
made to yield as bountiful crops as 
that of any other section. The only 
drawback is the scarcity of labor.
Experiments on the scientific breed­
ing of sheep are now being conducted. 
A herd of sixty sheep have been pur­
chased and those of this herd that 
produce twins, triplets, etc., ad in­
finitum, at one breeding, will be sep­
arated from the rest. Out of the 
present herd, about twenty have pro­
duced twins. It is hoped that by 
this method a race of sheep will be 
produced that will double or triple 
the present number of lambs bred 
per sheep.
The season at the camp commences 
with the school picnic on Saturday, 
May 24th. There will be camping 
parties of students on the farm all 
summer until the opening of school 
in the fall. It is the intention of 
some of the girls from the Margaret 
Morrison School to camp out for the 
first two weeks after the close of 
school.
Portable bungalows are now being 
constructed in sections in the car­
penter shop. These will house the 
students working on the farm dur­
ing the summer, as well as the sur­
veyors and football squad in the fall.
A scientific sewerage system will 
be installed by the civil and sanitary 
engineers during the summer. This 
will materially add to the comforts 
of the mansion house.
TRACK MEET WITH ALLE­
GHENY.
Though several inter-school meets 
have been held, the regular inter­
collegiate track season will open Sat-

COMMENCEMENT DAY CHANGED 
At a meeting of the executive committee on Tuesday 
afternoon, the date of Commencement was changed from 
Friday, June 20, to TUESDAY, June 17. This will necessi­
tate the changing of all Commencement plans. All those 
having charge of such plans will see Secretary Fields at once.
Hits Total 23 for Both Sides.
The Varsity out-hit Grove City on 
Wednesday, May 7, on Leeds Field, 
and won, 12-8. The game was fea­
tured by the hitting of both teams, 
but the home boys played better ball 
and won both in the field and at 
the bat. The Grove City boys scored 
four runs in the first inning and 
threw a scare into the Carnegie team 
that braced them up for the remain­
der of the game.
Hoerr pitched the entire game for 
the Varsity, and, after the first few 
minutes, held the game well in hand. 
He wound up the terrible first by 
striking out the last two men, and 
made eight others fan the air later 
in the contest. Patterson started on 
the mound for the visitors, and lasted 
four innings, then was sent to the 
outfield to make way for Glenn. The 
latter was not able to stop the bat­
ting spree, and seven more hits were 
registered, netting four runs in as 
many innings.
The game was started by Thorn 
flying out to Kreider. Hazelwood 
lifted a clean single over Brine’s head, 
and went to second when Lain failed 
to gather in a pitched ball. Connelly 
drew four wide ones and went to first, 
Patterson singled over first, Hazel­
wood scoring when Gearhart threw 
low. Veach scored Connelly and Pat­
terson on a clean double to left mid­
dle, and was brought in by a single 
to right by Allen. Gant and Allison 
missed three good ones each and 
were called out, ending the inning 
with four runs to the visitors’ credit.
Hall grounded out, Hazelwood to 
Allison, Allison fielded Kirk’s bunt 
alone, beating the speed king to the 
bag. Hazelwood juggled Gearhart’s 
grounder, and the captain landed 
safely. Vail waited for a pass, ad­
vancing Geary. Lain proved a good 
clean-up man by hitting for three 
bases past Veach in left, Kreider’s 
slow grounder .was fielded by the 
pitcher.
The Varsity tied up the score in 
the second, after Grove City had been 
retired. Moorhead was given a base 
on balls. Brine’s fly was caught by 
Thorn. Hoerr sacrificed, Hazelwood 
to Allison, and Moorhead scored 
when Hall doubled to right. Hall 
scored the tying run on Kirk’s sin­
gle, but Kirk was caught trying to 
stretch the hit into a two-bagger, 
Veach to Connelly.
Two more runs in the third, and

W. P. BAIRD EXONERATED
The Tartan wishes to congratulate Mr. 
Wilbur P. Baird on his complete acquittal 
and exoneration of the charge entered 
against him by a citizen of the city.
It is deplorable that the Pittsburgh 
newspapers exaggerate and make false 
statements, without first investigating the 
case. It is hoped that they will give as 
much prominence to Mr. Baird’s exoner­
ation as they did the charge made against 
him.
THE THISTLE.
The Thistle for 1913 made its in­
itial bow to the public last Friday 
evening. This year’s book contains 
several new features in make-up and 
composition which differentiate it 
from The Thistle of old, but which, 
on the whole, mark a step forward 
in the history of our year-book.
The leather cover, to begin with, 
is a great improvement. The run­
ning of the small pictures of student 
life and things interesting around 
Carnegie, add much to the value of 
The Thistle as a souvenir of student 
days. The cuts are not as good as 
they might be, or as those in some 
of The Thistles of the past, and 
some of the text might have been 
eliminated or toned down without 
harm. But taken as a whole, this 
year’s Thistle is a credit to the Board, 
who deserve the thanks of the Jun­
ior Class and congratulation from the 
whole institution. The best way to 
show that the efforts made by the 
Board are appreciated is for every 
student to purchase a 1913 Thistle.
GET THE SAFETY HABIT.
Last evening there was held in the 
Carnegie Music Hall an entertain­
ment on Safety, Sanitation and Wel­
fare, under the auspices of the Car­
negie Steel Company. It consisted 
of moving pictures and stereopticon 
views of the methods and means be­
ing taken to preserve human life and 
limb by the company, together with 
what is known as welfare work. This 
side of works management is a com­
ing one and one which those who 
graduate in time are certain to come 
in contact with at some time during 
their careers. It is to the credit of 
the steel company that they thus 
realize the importance of the work 
and take such steps to advance the 
cause, and in so doing they should 
have the co-operation of all.
When you come to think of it, 
could not some of these principles 
be applied by the individual students 
here? The shops and laboratories at 
Carnegie are beautifully equipped and 
it is only by exercising the utmost 
stupidity and thoughtlessness that 
one can come to harm. Once or twice 
a year, however, some student suc­
ceeds in so doing, and is slightly 
hurt. The other day, for example, 
a student threw on the power so sud­
denly that he blew the fuse and 
burned his hand very slightly. The 
burn was nothing, but the main cir­
cuit breaker in the power house was 
thrown out and all the power shut 
off, all due to the carelessness and 
thoughtlessness of the student. He 
suffered silghtly and all the other 
students using power were forced to 
wait until the power was again turned 
on. So get the safety habit. Be 
careful, not because you can seriously 
harm yourself, but because you may 
cause others delay and inconvenience. 
Get the safety habit and get the 
thoughtful habit. It pays.
AN INSPIRING COMMENCE­
MENT.
The commencement exercises in 
most of the colleges and schools of 
the country have not yet been held; 
but at Hampton Institute, this an­
nual event has already taken place. 
That great school, located near Hamp­
ton, Virginia, was founded by Gen­
eral Armstrong for the education of 
Indian and negro boys and girls. The 
graduating exercises of these students 
are deserving of the most favorable 
comment and invoke the highest com­
mendation upon those who partici­
pate in them. The following article 
is taken from an account in “The 
Outlook,” written by a representative 
who was present at the recent gradu­
ation held in the latter part of April.
A perennial inspiration is this 
Hampton Commencement. It is a 
living refutation of the idea that the 
artist, the humanitarian, and the prac­
tical man of business can find no 
ground of common understanding. 
Something of its appeal can be sug­
gested by the remarks of two recent
visitors seeing for the first time the 
graduation exercises of the Institute. 
On the platform a young colored 
man, deft-fingered and clear and dis­
tinct of speech, was delivering his 
“thesis.” For readers unfamiliar with 
Hampton’s methods who may be puz­
zled to know what fingers have to do 
with a thesis, it should be added that 
the young man was at the same time 
constructing and describing the frame 
of a model hip roof. “Oh,” said one 
visitor, “if Wendell Phillips could see 
this!” “Yes,” replied his friend, “and 
if John Ruskin could be here with 
him!” The thesis completed, it was 
at once put to practical test by be­
ing jumped on by the author and his 
collaborator. It is to be questioned 
how many academic orations could 
stand the equivalent of this drastic 
putting-to-the-proof. Other candi­
dates for diplomas, accompanying 
their action with a running commen­
tary at once interesting and concise, 
showed how to make a bed, cook 
oatmeal, and lay a brick wall. But, 
after all, the skill they displayed was 
of secondary interest to the spirit 
with which they worked. It is truly 
hard to realize all that Hampton has 
accomplished in the fifty-five years 
of its existence. Like the embodi­
ment of all ideals, the onlooker sees 
the accomplished fact» and very lit­
tle of the struggle that has brought 
that fact into concrete existence. 
Something of the magnitude of Hamp­
ton’s heroic undertaking is brought 
home to the visitor when he turns 
from such a Commencement program 
as we have described to listen to the 
organ-like chorus of over half a thou­
sand negro men and women lifted in 
the sweeping measures of the old 
freedom song:
‘Before I’d be a slave 
I’d be lying in my grave 
And go to my Lord and be free!’”
THE NEW HANDBOOKS.
The Seannachie Society is to be 
congratulated as well as thanked for 
the publication of the handbooks 
which have recently been distributed. 
The book is neatly gotten up and 
well edited, and contains an abund­
ance of information that is inter­
esting to every student. It is simi­
lar to “The Freshman Bible” of other 
schools, so called because it is of 
particular value to first year men, 
who, during the days of their ver­
dancy, cherish it as a true friend. It 
will be to the Plebes, a source of 
knowledge and it will enlighten them 
in the ways of Carnegie Tech.
CONFERENCE OF STUDENT 
EDITORS.
The value of a conference of stu­
dent editors, such as was held at the 
University of Pittsburgh last week, 
cannot be overestimated. When a 
body like that gets together and dis­
cusses their varied experiences, every­
body is bound to be benefited. The 
management of a college paper, the 
method of obtaining news, the ar­
rangement of the news in a suitable
manner—all these points furnish diffi­
culties. Their solution is different 
in each university, yet the experience 
of one editor is quite likely to help 
another. So it was at last week’s 
conference. Every man present re­
ceived some assistance from the sug­
gestions of others, almost every man 
himself gave some valued suggestion. 
And the remarks of Mr. Williams, of 
the Press, coming from a man of wide 
experience and invaluable training, 
were greatly appreciated. We should 
like to see this conference made an 
annual event. This year was the first 
time such an assembly had been plan­
ned, but we hope now that the move­
ment has been started that it will be 
continued every year.
I WONDER WHY.
It has been observed by a member 
of the Faculty connected with the 
school for seven years, that among 
the graduates, the number of “brides” 
from the Costume Economics De­
partment is twice that of any other 
department. The moral is obvious.
TRACK MEET WITH ALLEGHENY
Continued from page 1.
urday with the Allegheny dual meet. 
The strength of the Alleghenians is 
unknown, but judging from previous 
comparative records, and from the 
form Tech has shown in practice, 
Capt. Crawford and his men should 
be able to capture a majority of the 
points. Each team will be limited to 
three entrants in any event. The meet 
will start promptly at one o’clock, in 
order to have plenty of time for the 
field events. The Plaid team will 
again endeavor to maintain the 
school’s championship record and, 
therefore deserves the patronage of 
the entire student body. The team 
will consist of a large number of new 
men, who will be representing Tech 
for the first time in their school ca­
reers. The following are the entrants 
from which three men will be selected 
for each event:
100-yard dash: Marks, Kirk, Mayer,
C. Crawford, Rauh.
220-yard dash: Marks, Kirk, Mayer, 
Rauh, Dunseith.

THE TARTAN3
TECH ARCHITECTURAL STU­
DENT WINS HONORS
T. J. Raguerre Will Compete in the 
Final Competition for the 
Paris Prize.
Carnegie Tech, for the second time 
since the founding of the course in 
architecture has a student competing 
in the Paris Prize Finals. W. H. 
King, the first man bringing such 
honor to the school a number of 
years ago, is succeeded by T. J. Ra­
guerre, who, it is hoped by all, will 
outdistance King’s record of second 
place, and make a reality of the slo­
gan, “On to Paris.” The program 
for the problems came out Saturday, 
May 3rd, in New York, where Mr. 
Raguerre took the sketch. He will 
work on his drawing in the Design 
School until the three weeks preced­
ing the rendu, July 14th, which re­
maining time must be put on the 
problem in New York City. The 
congratulations of every Techite for 
“Rag’s” previous record are second 
only to our best wishes for the suc­
cess of the future.
CALL HIM—FRIAR.
In a previous issue of The Tartan 
it has been stated that the “White 
Friars” will not put on their annual 
production until early in the fall. 
This action was taken at the last 
meeting of the club and was approved 
by the faculty. The great interest 
which the student body has in the 
club is shown each year by the sup­
port which the productions are given. 
It was also recently proven by the 
free will donations of the faculty and 
students. We regret that the officers 
have not as yet complied with the 
request for a statement of the club’s 
financial condition, but feel certain 
that this matter will be arranged at 
the year-end meeting which will soon 
be held. The fact that the new the­
atre will be completed in time for 
the next production assures us that 
the Friars are not a thing of the 
past.
When the club was originally or­
ganized, the members were granted 
the title of Friar. This practice 
should be carried out among the 
students. If your chum is a member, 
address him as Friar and see how it 
tickles him. This practice will nat­
urally keep up the enthusiasm till 
the fall term opens and then,—well 
leave it to the Friars to deliver the 
goods. I would suggest that a list 
of the members of the club be pub­
lished in the next issue of The Tar­
tan.

three sets were required to determine 
the winner. Beeken was the only Tech 
player to win in the single events, 
while Duff and Douthett formed a 
winning pair in doubles. Kiskaddon 
did the best playing for Grove City, 
being victorious in both singles and 
doubles. The scores were as fol­
lows: Singles—Beeken, Tech, de­
feated Green, Grove City, 8-6, 6-2; 
Hanna, Grove City, defeated Dou­
thett, Tech, 1-6, 6-0, 64; Kiskaddon,

6-3, 4-6, 6-2; Acher, Grove City, de­
feated Duff, Tech, 6-2, 6-2. Doubles— 
Douthett and Duff, Tech, won from 
Acher and Hanna, Grove City, 6-3, 
8-10, 6-1; Kiskaddon and Green,
Grove City, won from Beeken and 
Miller, Tech, 7-5, 4-6, 8-6.
Manager Beeken has arranged an 
extensive tennis schedule, consisting 
of the following six matches. Through 
the courtesy of the University Club, 
the three home contests will be played 
on the club’s courts at the corner of 
Grant Boulevard and Forbes street.

VARSITY PLAYS PENN STATE.
Biggest Game of Year.
The most important baseball game 
of the season is scheduled for Satur­
day with Penn State. The State nine 
is a strong combination, and is well 
rated among the eastern colleges. 
Tech met State very early last sea­
son and lost a close game by a 4-3 
score. This year the game was ad­
vanced on the schedule, thus giving 
Tech an opportunity to be in better 
condition. Whether it wins or loses, 
the team should make a creditable 
showing. The players will leave at 
noon Friday and remain at Bellefonte 
over night. Any student desiring to 
accompany the team may receive team 
rates, which will be posted by Man­
ager Grotefiend during the week. The 
team will return Sunday morning.
On Saturday afternoon, the scrubs 
will play the Duquesne University 
Reserves on the latter’s grounds.

4THE TARTAN
M. M. C. S.
RETURNS FROM THE GLEE 
CLUB CONCERT.
To put it mildly, it went off with 
a flourish. Everyone was on needles 
and pins to know how successful the 
concert would be this year. Espe­
cially that hard-working manager, 
Estelle Brodhead. Well, anyone and 
everyone who was there can most 
enthusiastically say that Estelle need 
not to have' worried, for it was most 
successful. Mr. McDowell certainly 
deserves much credit, for the way that 
he trained the voices, for they cer­
tainly showed the result of most ex­
cellent, patient, and intelligent train­
ing. Of course, we can not say that 
he did not have at least some good 
material to work on, for the audience 
could distinguish more than one good 
voice; but then it is not an easy task 
to train many voices to sing well 
together, even though they might be 
extraordinarily good ones.
The solo work of Miss Williams de­
serves special recommendation. She 
sang, “Oh Dry Those Tears,” with 
a feeling such as could not easily be 
ignored by her audience, and that 
little Japanese enchore, which we all 
like so much, was also appreciated.
Last, but not least, by any means, 
was the dancing, which Miss Stoner 
executed with her usual wonderful 
ability. The first dance, the Lotus 
Dream, which was danced last year 
at the Kirmess, was especially sweet 
and pretty. The arrangement is most 
excellent in itself, and it was carried 
most creditably by the girls who took 
part. The costumes were very pleas­
ing and added that attractiveness 
which is most pleasing. Then there 
was the irresistible Chaminade in the 
second half of the program. This 
dance of the “Water Sprites” was ar­
ranged entirely by Miss Stoner, and 
danced by Miss Stoner and Miss East­
man. They both surely deserve spe­
cial congratulations on the execution 
of this dance. The costumes, how­
ever, in this one were also an in­
tegral part of it, and Miss Ernst, the 
designer, is to be highly commended.
All in all the concert was a grand 
success, to say nothing of the dance 
afterward, at which only those who 
took part in the concert were allowed 
to attend. The program was just 
long enough to leave a good taste in 
one’s mouth.
For the benefit of those who could

DRAFTSMAN’S CLUB BANQUET.
The Spirit of Tech was certainly 
rampant on last Friday evening, upon 
the occasion of the third annual ban­
quet of the Draftsman’s Club of the 
Night School of Applied Industries, 
held at the Monongahela House. The 
committee in charge left nothing un­
touched to make the event mem­
orable in the history of the organiza­
tion. The banquet hall was taste­
fully decorated with Tech pennants, 
streamers, flowers and palms; the 
menu was highly unique; and each 
guest was presented with a dandy 
stanascro pipe. But best of all was 
the crowd of good fellows who graced 
the festive board, everyone of whom 
responded to a toast in the most 
happy vein.
B. J. Patterson, Jr., acted as toast­
master for the evening and his in­
troductory address was a masterpiece 
by way of an exposition of what Tech 
stood for, to one like himself, who 
was about to graduate. E. F. Nash, 
the newly elected president of the 
club, gave the “official welcome” in 
nice style. Dean Connelley was 
greeted with real enthusiasm, and his 
speech ably radiated the spirit of 
the affair. The Dean, in turn, intro­
duced Burd J. Patterson, Sr., Secre­
tary of the Pittsburgh Civil Service 
Commission, and the guest of honor. 
Mr. Patterson brought out the op­
portunity in Pittsburgh for techni­
cally trained man, especially in the 
very near future, and paid a glowing 
tribute to the work of the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, especially in 
regards to the high calibre of its 
graduates. Fred J. Hartman, assist­
ant to the Dean, spoke on the Per­
sonification of Tech Spirit, and James
D. Smith, graduate of the University 
of Pennsylvania, also spoke along the 
same line. Clever speeches were also 
made by the various members of 
the club—many of them being maiden 
attempts, others from Seniors full 
of regret to leave school life and spe­
cial mention is due to R. F. Crom 
and ex-president McCausland for their 
after-dinner efforts.

CONCERT AT BEAVER.
One of the last concerts of the 
closing year was given at Christ 
Church, Beaver, Pa., on Thursday, 
May 1st. The men left Union Sta­
tion at 5:35 p. m. and shortly after 
their arrival at that city they were 
treated to a sumptuous dinner.
The clubs were warmly received, 
although this was their initial appear­
ance there. This speaks well for 
the management on account of its 
rapidly gaining publicity.
The train was boarded at 11 p. m. 
and the boys reached Pittsburgh at 
11:50 p. m.
CLUBS PLEASE AT EAST LIB­
ERTY Y. M. C. A.
A full house greeted the Musical 
Clubs at the East Liberty branch 
Y. M. C. A., on Saturday night, May
3. Many notable critics in musical 
circles'were present. The concert was 
very well rendered and delighted a 
large and enthusiastic audience. Tech 
folk was in evidence as the audience 
rose during the singing of the Alma 
Mater. One or more concerts will 
close a most successful season.

NOTES FROM MACHINERY HALL 
Mesta Engine Under Repairs
Up to the present the Mesta en­
gine being installed in the power 
house has proved a rather recalci­
trant servant. At least it has proved 
that, like all well designed engines, 
it refuses to run until all its parts are 
in perfect adjustment.
The engine was completely set up 
for the first time about the first of 
April, and after the usual adjustments 
was run with a light load. After a 
while ominous knockings made them­
selves apparent, which gradually in­
creased in intensity during the run­
ning test.
The cylinder was dissected and it 
was found that the lubrication had 
been imperfect, due to the use of a 
wrong kind of oil and that conse­
quently the piston had scraped the 
walls of the cylinder. The latter was 
therefore sent back to the shop for 
hasty repairs as the engine was 
needed for inspection night.
After Herculean efforts on the part 
of the erectors the engine was ready 
to help in carrying the extra load. 
This it did, the failure of the lights 
in the early part of the evening being 
due to the low steam pressure, while 
another boiler was being put in.
The engine requires a pressure of 
150 pounds in order to fully exert 
itself.
But once more it was found that 
there were defects. This time it was 
the fault of the piston head which 
had not been repaired owing to lack 
of time. Now both piston head and 
cylinder are at the shops and Prof. 
Trinks hopes that the Mesta will soon 
be able to relieve the over-worked 
Ball engine, which now carries the, 
total load of the schools. The West- 
inghouse gas engine is not in run­
ning condition as yet, as parts of 
the engine have to be replaced.
The new engine is doubly protected 
against excessive speed by a cut-off 
attached to the governor and by an 
electric release on the throttle valve. 
When one realizes that the linear 
speed of the 16-foot fly wheel is one 
hundred feet per second, over a mile 
a minute, it will be perceived that ex­
tra precautions are necessary in or­
der to prevent disintegration.
A De Saval water turbine has just 
been purchased and added to the 
power house equipment. The large 
cooling tank north of Machinery Hall 
is also completed.
Work is being rushed on all parts 
of Machinery Hall. The framework 
for the tower has not yet arrived and 
this retards the completion of the 
iron work. The outer walls will prob­
ably be finished by the first of June, 
which will give the students an idea 
of the appearance of the structure 
when completed.
The old system of using a heated 
iron and dirty cloth presFf*s the grime 
and dirt into your garments. Our » 
sanitary machine steams it all out, and 
removes permanently the dirt, pers­
piration, odor and grime. See Shu­
man the Dry Cleaner, 3911 Forbes

ATHLETICS.
Plans are now under way for an 
inter-fraternity track meet to be held 
in the near future. Such a meet 
should be very* closely contested as 
the material is rather evenly divided. 
It is hoped that a cup will be offered 
after the manner of the Tech and 
Mott cups.
Several of the fraternities should 
be able to turn out good baseball 
teams, and it is probable that several 
inter-fraternity games will be ar­
ranged. V

EDITORS

paper men must be always alert and 
watchful, prepared to give the best 
that is in them.”
In speaking of “Journalism as a 
Profession,” Dr. Williams said the 
profession of Journalism can 
only come from a profes­
sional education, and that, as 
the law is more systematically taught 
today in the schools than when law 
students studied in the offices of an 
attorney preceptor, so the profession 
of journalism is being successfully 
taught in the schools.
The last meeting of the conference 
was held on Saturday morning. This 
session was mainly for the business 
managers of the papers.

two in the fourth made the game safe 
for the home team, but they scored 
once more in the fifth and three times 
in the sixth, when Glenn opposed 
them.
Grove City added three to their 
score in the seventh inning. Hazel­
wood, first up, singled to middle and 
stole second. Connelly hit to left 
for one base, sending Hazelwood to 
third, and then stole a base. Pat­
terson singled to left, and Hazelwood 
and Connelly scored. Moorhead 
missed Veach’s grounder, and Patter­
son scored while Veach was being 
thrown out at second, Kirk to Gear­
hart. Glenn was an easy out, Brine 
to Moorhead. Gant walked, but 
was left, as Allison flied out to Moor­
head.
Hall and Kirk each had three hits, 
but Capt. Gearhart was not credited 
with a bingle, although on base four 
times on errors by the opposing in­
field. Vail made a sensation by drop­
ping a fly -in the third inning, the
first performance of the kind by him 
on record. The score:
