What’s New in Dining? Chartwells’ planSkinner leaves for State Department 
WILSON EKERN
Copy Manager
Kiron Skinner, the 
founding director of the 
Carnegie Mellon Institute 
for Politics and Strategy 
and Taube Professor of 
International Relations 
and Politics, started her 
new role as a senior pol-
icy adviser to Secretary 
of State Mike Pompeo on 
Sept. 4. Skinner was addi-
tionally appointed as the 
State Department’s new 
Director of Policy Plan-
ning.
According to the State 
Department website, the 
Policy Planning of?ce is 
responsible for “striking 
a ?ne line between [the] 
day-to-day requirements 
of diplomacy and the de-
velopment of long term, 
strategic plans.” This role, 
therefore, makes Skinner 
one of the people shaping 
United States foreign poli-
cy, and includes the power 
to “bring constructive, dis-
senting, or alternate views 
on... foreign policy issues 
to the Secretary of State.” 
The power of Skinner’s new 
role was acknowledged by 
Carnegie Mellon president 
Farnam Jahanian, who 
said of Skinner's appoint-
ment that “being called to 
serve the nation...exempli-
?es the growing role CMU 
faculty play in shaping the 
policy and research agenda 
at the national level.”
The ?nal shape of 
that policy and research 
agenda remains to be seen, 
however. According to the 
right-wing blog Breitbart 
News, “a person close to 
Skinner described her as 
a ‘Trump loyalist’ who is 
not going to deviate from 
Trump’s ‘America First’ 
agenda,” while in a state-
ment given to Breitbart 
News, Skinner said that 
“[effectively implement-
ing] President Trump’s 
America First vision means 
thinking through the 
President’s ideas and good 
instincts with the serious-
ness that they deserve.” 
These ideas range from the 
separation and detention 
of families seeking asylum 
to an expansive wall on 
the southern border of the 
United States.
Skinner has worked 
with conservative politi-
cians in the past, serving on 
various boards and politi-
cal campaigns for George 
W. Bush, Newt Gingrich, 
and Mitt Romney, as well 
as President Trump’s 
transition team in 2016. 
Skinner’s new role in 
Washington, D.C. follows 
those of former Carnegie 
Mellon Chief Technol-
ogy Of?cer Jeff Boleng, 
who left Carnegie Mel-
lon in April 2018, and 
Robert Behler, former 
Chief Operating Of?cer 
and deputy director of 
the Software Engineering 
Institute, who left in Dec. 
2017, both for positions 
in the Department of De-
fense.
Students in the Institute 
for Politics and Strategy 
had their own takes on 
Skinner’s appointment. 
Eoin Wilson-Manion, a 
second-year International 
Relations and Politics ma-
jor, said that it is “hard 
for me to get behind any-
thing about the Trump 
administration,” but that 
he “[does] think, on a sur-
face level at least, that it 
is good for CMU to have 
people [representing it] 
in the real world.” This is 
especially true given the 
enormous Department of 
Defense contracts, such 
as a $732 million dollar, 5 
year award to the Software 
Engineering Institute in 
2017, or an $80 million dol-
lar award to the Advanced 
Robotics Manufacturing 
Group, an initiative led 
by Carnegie Mellon. Ac-
cording to the Carnegie 
Mellon’s 2016 annual ?-
nancial report, sponsored 
projects like these account 
for 33.3 percent of the op-
erating revenue, totaling 
almost 400 million dollars.
Trevor Lazar, a second-
year International Rela-
tions and Politics major 
who worked as a research 
associate for Skinner’s 
International Relations de-
partment, said he “greatly 
respect[s] her knack for 
quality research and the 
strength of her convic-
tions.” When asked about 
Carnegie Mellon President 
Farnam Jahanian’s com-
ments about the grow-
ing in?uence of Carnegie 
Mellon faculty over 
national policy, Lazar said 
that he thinks “CMU faculty 
bring a unique perspective 
to policy grounded in re-
search and science that is 
unique to the ?eld. I believe 
this will be an important, 
fresh perspective on the 
national level.” Lazar and 
Wilson-Manion both com-
mented on how important 
diverse ideological per-
spectives are in the Inter-
national Relations and Pol-
itics department, and it will 
be interesting to see the im-
pact such an experienced, 
competent person like 
Kiron Skinner can make in 
such an in?uential role.

On May 15, Carnegie 
Mellon students received 
an email from Dean of 
Students Gina Casalegno, 
announcing the school’s 
new primary dining ven-
dor: Chartwells Higher 
Education. This change 
came at the end of a 
nine-year contract with 
CulinArt Group, a name 
that had become as fa-
miliar to upperclassmen 
as the Cut or the Black 
Chairs. 
In addition to the new 
vendor, the announcement 
promised renovations at 
numerous dining loca-
tions, more flexible meal 
plans, two new dining 
locations in the Tepper 
Quadrangle, and further 
investments in sustain-
ability. On July 1, just 
six weeks after the email 
was sent, the contract 
officially began.
With class in session 
and dining locations full, 
the changes are appar-
ent. Pure, a new dining 
concept located in the 
Tepper Quandrangle, of-
fers a variety of meals 
free of growth hormones, 
artificial flavoring, and 
antibiotics. The focus, 
said Director of Dining 
Services Pascal Petter, is 
on health and wellness. 
“Our strategic plan, and 
the university strategic 
plan,” he said, “is to pro-
vide facilities that are 
engaging, social, and pro-
vide healthy options for 
students.”

Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity’s Andrew Moore, Dean 
of the School of Computer 
Science (SCS), announced 
that he would be stepping 
down from his position 
on Aug. 28, after serving 
as Dean since 2014. Dean 
Moore will pursue “a new 
professional opportunity,” 
as told in a Carnegie Mellon 
University press release, 
after ?nishing the calendar 
year as Dean.
Carnegie Mellon Presi-
dent Farnam Jahanian 
spoke high praises of 
Moore’s tenure, saying 
“Andrew Moore has been 
passionate about the im-
pact of technology on so-
ciety and a leader in the 
way technology enhances 
people’s lives. At this pivot-
al time for both the School 
of Computer Science and 
Carnegie Mellon, we will 
make sure the momentum 
he built will continue.”
Moore has been with 
Carnegie Mellon University 
since 1993, when he joined 
the faculty as a professor 
of computer science and 
robotics. In 2006, he took 
over as director of Google 
Pittsburgh for the opening 
of their Pittsburgh campus. 
His last four years have 
been spent as the ?fth Dean 
of SCS.
In an interview with 
The Tartan, Dean Moore 
expressed his satisfaction 
at the increased diversity 
of the department, saying 
“SCS has the capability 
of moving the needle on 
increased participation in 
computer science under-
grad degree by underrep-
resented minorities from 
around the U.S.”
Under Moore’s tenure, 
the School of Computer 
Science’s incoming classes 
reached gender parity for 
the last three years in a 
row, as well as growing to 
211 students this year from 
just 139 students in 2014.
On the issue of things he 
wished he could have seen 
achieved, Moore said that 
the department “worked 
on a bunch of things but I 
never really got started on 
the central issues of [the] 
ultra-important question 
of the quality of life for 
our graduate students. 
Many useful steps forward 
happened, but we never got 
around to making it a major 
annual focus for SCS as it 
deserves to be.”
That being said, since 
Moore took over as dean, 
the graduate and under-
graduate computer science 
programs have remained 
some of the very top ranked 
in the world.
In response to the new 
“President’s Task Force on 
Campus Climate,” estab-
lished in the wake of two 
SCS faculty resigning this 
August after alledging pro-
fessional harassment and 
sexism Moore told The 
Tartan that “campus cli-
mate issues around gender 
harassment, bullying, and 
unintentional-but-damag-
ing unconscious bias are a 
really serious issue.”
He went on to specify 
that this goes beyond sexual 
harassment, for which 
“well de?ned protocols 
are in place,” to something 
known as “professional 
sexism — one example is 
the phenomenon described 
in the title of the Atlantic 
article: ‘Pushy Is Used to 
Describe Women Twice as 
Often as Men.’”
As for whether Carnegie 
Mellon is better or worse 
than other places in this 
regard, Moore is unsure, 
but he does state that he 
knows “everyone on cam-
pus wants us to be signi?-
cantly better, not middle of 
the pack.”
Dean Moore’s career has 
been an interesting mix of 
both academic and private 
sector work, with profes-
sorship at Carnegie Mel-
lon University, directing 
Google Pittsburgh, be-
ing the Vice President of 
Engineering at Google 
Commerce, to his current 
position of dean.
Moore told The Tartan 
that he learned a lot work-
ing in industry, speci?-
cally a heightened sense of 
urgency, but he also adds 
that “one of the biggest 
things in my role as Dean 
is getting to know my stu-
dents and realizing that 
the middle of the century 
is probably in good hands.”
Referring to his future 
employment opportunity, 
Moore quipped to The 
Tartan that if he “dropped 
even the slightest hint, 
there would be black heli-
copters circling the campus 
within minutes.”
At the risk of being overly 
speculative, The New York 
Times, in an article on the 
future Amazon headquar-
ters, raised the question 
“could the dean of Carnegie 
Mellon University’s School 
of Computer Science 
be resigning to run a 
Pittsburgh HQ2?” The 
Tartan has no further infor-
mation on this connection, 
but regardless, Moore’s 
future likely sees a salient 
assignment.
In the Carnegie Mellon 
press release on his 
resignation, Moore stated 
“I want to express my deep-
est thanks to the amazing 
students, faculty and staff 
of SCS,” continuing, “this 
school is extremely strong 
and remains a thought-
leader in computer science 
and robotics. With the 
technological changes now 
facing mankind, the world 
has never needed a strong 
SCS more than it does 
today.”

Special to The Tartan 
Student Senate will 
be holding vacancy elec-
tions on Sept. 13 at 5 
p.m. in the the Cohon 
Center Danforth room. 
The Senate is a great way 
to get involved in student 
government and have a 
positive impact on your 
college as well as the 
university as a whole.
The different com-
mittees that senators 
can serve on impact 
academics, campus life, 
business, and many 
other important areas 
at Carnegie Mellon. As 
a senator, you represent 
your college, and every 
senator gets an equal say 
and equal vote at weekly 
Senate meetings. The col-
leges that currently have 
vacancies are the College 
of Fine Arts (1), Dietrich 
College (2), Tepper 
School of Business (1), 
and Mellon College of 
Science (2).
If you are interested in 
running for senator, you 
need to have a petition of 
25 signatures from mem-
bers of your own college. 
For vacancy elections, 
you will need a signed 
physical petition, instead 
of the online petitions 
for standard elections. 
The PDF for the petition 
can be found at: https://
www.cmu.edu/stugov/
senate/student-senate-
vacancy-election-petition.
pdf. Once you fill out the 
petition, you may submit 
it to mailbox number 46 
at the Cohon Center, or to 
any member of the Senate 
Executive Committee.
For candidates who 
have submitted petitions 
by Sept. 13, they can come 
before the senate and give 
a speech detailing why 
they want to be on Senate, 
as well as their suitabil-
ity for representing their 
college. Following these 
speeches, the existing 
senators will vote for the 
candidates they feel ?t best 
in the vacant seats. For 
those who don’t get elected 
into these vacancies, the 
senate also offers the po-
sition of Member At Large 
(MAL). MALs receive the 
same amount of in?uence 
and speaking power dur-
ing Senate meetings, but 
have more ?exibility in 
terms of attendance policy 
and required hours than 
regular senators. Those 
running for a MAL position 
will have to submit a ?lled 
petition and follow the 
same procedures as those 
running for senator.

DIVIDED DEMOCRACY
in the Age of Social Media
Sunstein’s lecture will focus on how, as the Internet grows more sophisticated, it is creating 
new threats to democracy. Social media companies—such as Facebook—can sort us ever 
more e?ciently into groups of the like-minded, creating echo chambers that amplify our 
views. It's no accident that on some occasions, people of di?erent political views cannot 
even understand each other. Sunstein will describe how the online world creates "cyber-
cascades," exploits "con?rmation bias" and assists "polarization entrepreneurs." And he 
will explain why online fragmentation endangers the shared conversations, experiences 
and understandings that are the lifeblood of democracy. In response, Sunstein will propose 
practical and legal changes to make the internet friendlier to democratic deliberation.

Underground in 
Morewood Gardens 
embody the kind 
of thinking Petter 
expressed. The 
Underground features 
an entirely new floor 
plan with more space, 
an open kitchen envi-
ronment, and improved 
lighting. Though the 
stage and the dingy 
lighting of yesteryear 
are gone, classic menu 
items such as the PB 
Banana Crunch are still 
available. 
The La Prima stand 
in the Wean Lobby has 
been updated to a full 
counter with walled 
seating and line space 
that doesn’t interfere 
with foot traffic in the 
highly-congested area. 
The popular vendor is 
currently trying to se-
cure a local contract 
to provide vegan and 
vegetarian Grab n’ Go 
options.
Stephanie’s in the 
Mellon Institute has 
been converted to an 
autonomous 24-hour 
snack bar named Market 
C. “Knowing the gradu-
ate students who work 
in Mellon, we wanted 
to provide a convenient 
location that also has 
fresh food,” said Petter, 
noting the challenging 
hours required of those 
students and the diffi-
culties of staffing a lo-
cation to accommodate 
those hours. Market C is 
located on the 4th floor 
of the Mellon Institute, 
and is completely auto-
mated; customers check 
out at a kiosk. 
The Cohon Center 
dining cluster has been 
given a sleek gray paint 
scheme, with new con-
cepts Bibimbap (serv-
ing Korean rice bowls), 
Bowl Life (a noodle 
bar), and Realwich (a 
sandwich bar serving 
meats free of nitrates). 
The vegetarian and 
vegan Evgefstos has 
been rebranded as 
Roots, serving an up-
dated menu of grain 
bowls, superfood bowls, 
and hot entrees. The 
City Grill is now the 
Back Bar Grill, serving 
familiar burgers and 
fries as well as new veg-
etarian options.
Also new in the 
Cohon Center are feed-
back kiosks, featuring 
touchscreen interfaces 
where students and 
visitors can quickly rate 
their dining experi-
ence. These stations are 
subtle, but they indi-
cate an important shift 
in the culture of Dining 
Services. “We’re look-
ing to have students be 
engaged with our din-
ing program,” said Mr. 
Petter, “and to have 
input, quite honestly.”
In a proactive effort 
to improve the dining 
experience at Carnegie 
Mellon (Niche.com 
gave campus food a 
C+), Dining Services 
is opening its doors to 
students, offering a 
number of ways to get 
involved.
One exciting 
proposal penned by 
Chartwells is a rotating 
retail concept in which 
students get to vote on 
a particular cuisine for 
each semester. In this 
proposal, Chartwells 
chooses the most popu-
lar choice and develops 
a menu, to be offered 
for the duration of a 
semester.
Teaching Kitchen, 
another new project, 
will be starting this 
fall, offering chef-
led student cook-
ing classes in Schatz 
dining room. Dining 
Marketing Coordinator, 
Nutrition Educator 
and Dietitian Jessica 
Tones said that for 
these classes, simpler 
is better. “Most people 
want to learn to cook 
something that they 
would actually make 
again,.. ” explained 
the veteran cooking 
instructor. “Teaching 
someone how to make 
a vinaigrette can launch 
them into being able 
to make a wide variety 
of dishes.” Teaching 
Kitchen will happen on 
a pop-up basis, posted 
on Dining’s new events 
page AndyEATS, and 
will also be available for 
student organizations 
and group events.
In addition to 
student input on food, 
Dining Services plans 
to team up with stu-
dents to take on sus-
tainability issues in the 
near future. There are 
currently four locations 
on campus with com-
posting capabilities; 
Dining Services and 
Chartwells hope to col-
laborate with student 
group CMU Sustainable 
Earth to increase that 
number and convert as 
much plastic packaging 
as possible to composta-
ble materials, starting 
with the Resnik servery.
The issue of waste 
isn’t a simple procure-
ment shift, however. 
“It’s one thing to put 
a compost bin out,” 
says Petter. “It’s an-
other to communicate 
to our community what 
exactly goes in it.”

What’s New in Dining 2018 
DINING , from A1
THE FAIR: a rebrand, and a return to an annual tradition 
JACOB PAUL
Junior Staffwriter
On last Wednesday 
afternoon, the Activities 
Fair, this year renamed 
“THE FAIR,” was held in 
the Cohon Center. Tables 
of student-run organiza-
tions filled the Wiegand 
Gymnasium, the Connan 
Room, and Rangos 
Ballroom from wall to wall. 
It was quite a testament to 
the diverse array of inter-
ests that make up Carnegie 
Mellon. Students, mostly 
first years, rushed in to 
explore all that Carnegie 
Mellon has to offer. THE 
FAIR, held inside this year 
due to construction on 
The Cut, lasted a couple of 
hours.
Club leaders competed 
for students' attention, hol-
lering jingles at passersby 
as they handed out stickers 
and candy. Highlight reels 
played on laptops, and 
pop music blasted from 
portable speakers.
There was a constant 
refrain of “sign up for our 
list and take a sticker," or 
“I see you looking at our 
poster!”
One voice resounded 
above all the hoopla. “If 
you got a face, you got a 
place! CMU Rowing Club!” 
shouted Nethani Bryant, 
senior, with all his might. 
No one else was putting in 
as much effort to be heard. 
One of his teammates held 
a 12 foot long oar straight 
in the air, and two others 
handed out flyers advertis-
ing an info session directly 
after THE FAIR.
“Around 10 percent of 
the people who sign up 
for the email blast come to 
the first meeting, at least 
for our club,” explained 
Ashwati Kristan, a post-
doctoral student who has 
been running the Shoto-
kan Karate Club for nine 
years. Kristan and three 
other members stood fully 
cloaked in white karate 
uniforms, emanating a 
commanding presence. 
The club has been at Carn-
egie Mellon since 1973.
“Take a Unix cheat 
sheet so you’ll never be 
alone at CMU not know-
ing what command to 
use!” exclaimed Ford 
Spiegel, a graduate stu-
dent. The Carnegie Mellon 
University Computer Club 
offers students access to a 
wide array of antique and 
modern “machines,” as 
well as some they can't af-
ford. “We do weird things 
with computers.” The 
stack of cheat sheets was 
shrinking quickly.
Over a blaring boom-
bap instrumental, Ryan 
Harty, President of CMU 
Cyphers, rhymed the 
names of people interested 
in the Freestyle rap club. 
At the table for the Jazz 
Club, founded just last 
year, students shuffled 
through a vinyl collection 
full of classics; Coltrane, 
Rollins, and Davis amongst 
them. SPIRIT was handing 
out flyers for their annual 
fashion show. “We are also 
a haven for people who 
support black people,” ex-
plained Mecca Parker, a 
senior who is the chair of 
the SPIRIT fashion show.
“Quidditch has become 
a combination of many 
sports; rugby, lacrosse, 
dodgeball, and baseball,” 
said Dominique Brych, 
senior and Captain of 
the Quidditch team, with 
excitement. “It’s a fun 
thing to try at least once!”
There were so many 
clubs that some even spilled 
out into the hallways.  At 
the Kirr Commons, com-
monly referred to as the 
Black Chairs, students 
could register to vote.
Some students seemed 
to find the array of options 
overwhelming.
“It was packed, a lot of 
options,” said Medhane 
Ollushoda, a fifth year who 
signed up for the Muslim 
Student Association.
“I think it’s a lot of 
people, and it's hard to find 
the club you're interested 
in,” shrugged Emmanuel 
Gama, graduate student.
Last Wednesday, dozens of organizations vied for new members as students ?ltered around tables looking at on-campus clubs during THE FAIR, held this year indoors in Wiegand Gym and Rangos Ballroom.

Harvard lawsuit sparks college admissions debate
Within the walls of Harvard, a 
storm begins to brew, threatening 
to dismantle the previously elusive 
admissions process the elite Ivy 
League university has been using for 
years. As one of the country’s most 
prestigious universities faces allega-
tions of discrimination against Asian 
American students, a great threat 
forms against the future of af?rma-
tive action in America. The trial, set 
to begin in mid-October, will ulti-
mately inform the way in which ed-
ucation policy — particularly policy 
in place to combat forms of discrimi-
nation — will consider factors such 
as race in their application process.
It is common practice in many 
colleges and universities to include 
race as one of many factors in a “ho-
listic” consideration of an applicant. 
While this vague language has been 
criticized by these students as un-
fairly subjective, Harvard profusely 
asserts that this approach is in no 
way discriminatory for any group 
but rather assessed in consider-
ation of selecting a diverse pool of 
students. This search for “diversity” 
has become the rationale for why 
those coveted spots are not offered 
to more Asian American students, 
pushing them to believe that such 
process stems from discrimination. 
However, af?rmative action may be 
less involved with those decisions 
than we believe.
When considering who is to 
blame in this discussion, the policy 
that takes the brunt of the argument 
is not actually part of the problem 
when it comes to anti-Asian bias. 
Harvard’s “holistic” admissions 
process may follow a model calling 
for higher numbers of all minorities 
in?uenced by af?rmative action, but 
its use of other subjective measures 
bring on problems of their own 
that make it dif?cult for students of 
marginalized groups to overcome. 
Factors like sociability, charisma, 
and personality are a few of the non-
quantitative methods of measuring 
students that are said to be a part 
of this process. The abolishment 
of af?rmative action does little to 
help students have more space, but 
rather enables a more pointed focus 
on biased and elusive means of 
judgement.
The complexity of the case is 
re?ected once more in the divisive 
responses from groups within 
the Asian American community 
itself. The National Council of 
Asian Paci?c Americans (NCAPA) 
issued a statement rejecting the 
notion that they stood opposed to 
af?rmative action, making a point 
to highlight the ways in which such 
policy played a crucial role in aiding 
Asian American and Paci?c Islander 
students. In their statement, the 
NCAPA commends universities 
attempting to apply those policies in 
their admissions process and stands 
in solidarity with their efforts. In the 
eyes of the NCAPA, the goal is not to 
rid the system of af?rmative action, 
but offer methods of reform that 
result in the opportunity for more 
minority students in a system that 
has historically held a consistent 
majority through other methods of 
recruitment.
Universities have obscured the 
slippage of far more consequential 
factors affecting admissions by 
working in smoke and mirrors. 
Selective admissions that favor 
athletes, children of donors, and 
legacy applicants are an upheld 
university tradition that has long 
been in place with little rebuttal. In 
Harvard speci?cally, this preference 
has proven to put all non-white 
applicants at a disadvantage, an 
issue rarely confronted in cases 
such as these. Top tier universities 
also seem to often prefer a diverse 
ethnic makeup rather than taking 
into account socioeconomic factors, 
forcing the range of diversity to be 
limited by those selections. However, 
universities hide these issues by 
masquerading their consequences 
as a result of af?rmative action. 
Regardless of how policy reforms, 
these untouched allocations set 
aside by schools for preferred 
students will continue to create 
pressure amongst applicants as they 
leave only a small quota to be ?lled 
by disadvantaged students each 
year.
As things are now, we ?nd our-
selves standing at a precipice.  It is 
a great practice to hold institutions 
responsible for their ethics, creat-
ing equal opportunity for those who 
have worked to reach these spaces, 
collectively. The history is available 
and ever present, and with its effects 
laying the foundation for these very 
conversations to occur, we must 
choose where we go from here. To 
all of the Asian American students 
that feel they suffer from an obso-
lete system, your experiences are 
certainly real and your feelings justi-
?ed. However, the target you choose 
to confront on the stand should be 
considered thoroughly if you truly 
argue for equal opportunity. It is a 
disservice to your own ?ght to ig-
nore the historical precedent of the 
policy that has enabled us the im-
mense progress we’ve made thus far.
An Arizona liberal’s tribute to McCain
TREVOR LAZAR
Staffwriter
John McCain — war hero, 
Arizona Senator, conservative, and 
patriot — died on Aug. 25, 2018, just 
four days before what would have 
been his 82nd birthday. His passing 
has brought with it an extended 
mourning of a self-described 
maverick; some remark that he 
was the last of his kind. Moreover, 
his public battle with brain cancer 
since his diagnosis last year added 
a heightened sense of drama and 
urgency to his ?nal months in the 
Senate. Indeed, his no-vote that 
sunk, perhaps for good, Republican 
attempts to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act will be remembered as one 
of the most important single votes 
of this decade. In an era that has left 
a malleable path for Republicans 
to pass far-right laws, McCain was 
a vocal Trump critic who will be 
remembered for his singular, active 
resistance in support of a progressive 
healthcare law enacted by his greatest 
political adversary. His character 
and commitment to country shone 
brighter than his political ideology 
in the end, and his good actions 
overshadowed his mistakes in the 
?nal chapter of his life.
As an Arizona resident, a pro-
gressive Democrat, and a frequent 
conservative critic (going far beyond 
Trump), I hold a complicated view 
of Senator McCain. I disagreed with 
him on most major policy issues. I 
particularly took issue with his close 
ties to the NRA.
However, now, I cannot help but 
feel grateful. Dissertations could 
be written by liberals like me over 
the merits of McCain’s tenure in the 
Senate. If I wrote pages upon pages, 
covering every vote and decision in 
John McCain’s lifetime, I still would 
be con?icted. Our politics, as they 
stand, are not in a state of normalcy. 
They are rife with vitriol and horri?c 
bigotry and discrimination, coupled 
with a series of startling breaks with 
precedent in our political institutions 
and procedures. I associate people 
like John McCain with a degree 
of normalcy. Not stability or even 
political function, but normalcy.
This distinction is important. 
The Senate’s ef?ciency has been ex-
ponentially slowed by gridlock and 
hyper-partisanship over the course 
of the last few decades, and to an ex-
tent, McCain played a role in this. Yet, 
so did all members of the Senate who 
served and have served during that 
time. McCain was a politician, no 
doubt, but he was responsive to his 
constituents, and respectful of those 
whose opinions differed.
It speaks great volumes that of the 
key speakers at McCain’s various fu-
neral services, both former President 
Obama and Vice President Biden de-
livered eulogies. That speaks to the 
legacy of an era in American politics 
that is now just behind us. I ?nd it 
hard to believe that Barack Obama’s 
recent speech eviscerating the Trump 
administration only coincidentally 
lined up with John McCain’s passing.
Many — liberals, especially — 
have criticized President Obama for 
his relative lack of presence in the 
public sphere since his departure 
from of?ce. Whether that criticism 
is warranted is another conversation 
altogether. Nonetheless, I believe 
Obama looked to McCain’s vocal cri-
tique of the current administration 
and decided to honor that legacy.
Now, as John McCain is laid to 
rest, Barack Obama has said goodbye 
to his respected opponent, Joe Biden 
has said goodbye to his friend, and 
our country must say goodbye. In 
bidding the late Senator from Arizona 
farewell, we Americans must hold 
ourselves and our representatives to 
the standard that John McCain set.
“Ten years ago, I had the privi-
lege to concede defeat in the election 
for president. I want to end my fare-
well to you with the heartfelt faith in 
Americans that I felt so powerfully 
that evening.
I feel it powerfully still.
Do not despair of our present 
dif?culties but believe always in the 
promise and greatness of America, 
because nothing is inevitable here. 
Americans never quit. We never sur-
render. We never hide from history. 
We make history.”
Godspeed, Senator McCain.Anna Boyle/Art Editor

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC 
SOCIETY
Special to The Tartan
From Sept. 24-26, the Technical 
Opportunities Conference (TOC) 
will take place in the Cohen Cen-
ter, and the long history of close 
collaboration between Carnegie 
Mellon and the defense industry 
will almost certainly continue.
The U.S. Department of 
Defense (DoD) is the wealthiest 
and most powerful customer of 
past TOC corporate attendees such 
as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, 
and General Dynamics. DoD 
is also a major funder of off-
campus Carnegie Mellon research 
institutions such as the Software 
Engineering Institute in Oakland 
(currently on year three of a ?ve-
year, $1.73 billion DoD contract), 
the National Robotics Engineering 
Center in Lawrenceville (selected 
in 2016 for four DoD-funded 
projects totaling $10.6 million), 
and the soon-to-be-built Advanced 
Robotics Manufacturing Institute 
in Hazelwood (earned $80 million 
in DoD startup funding in 2017). 
In addition, the DoD awards 
about $135 million each year (p. 
16) in grants to individual CMU 
researchers in departments like 
the Robotics Institute, the Institute 
for Software Research, Psychology, 
and Social and Decision Sciences. 
Most recently, in April, the DoD’s 
Army Research Laboratory 
established a partnership with our 
engineering college, CIT, to give its 
engineers access to the military’s 
“real-world, challenging problems 
and data sets, as well as access to 
ARL facilities, infrastructure, and 
equipment,” with the ultimate goal 
of providing “increased capabilities 
for national security and defense,” 
according to CIT’s Dean James H. 
Garrett, Jr.
This relationship goes back until 
at least 1987, when the university 
received $103 million from the 
DoD to fund research in “weapons 
targeting and tracking.” By 2004, 
the radio program, Democracy 
Now!, had run a segment about 
our school entitled “Carnegie 
Military University.” And this past 
May, PublicSource reported on the 
university’s current connections to 
the military-industrial complex. 
In short, Carnegie Mellon’s role 
in U.S. imperialism and corporate 
greed are a continuing stain on 
the university’s public image and a 
failure of leadership on the part of 
our administrators.
This failure is epitomized 
by the companies privileged to 
attend our most prestigious yearly 
career fair. The TOC, which is 
sponsored by CIT and run by the 
Society of Women Engineers, 
has hosted numerous companies 
that pro?t off of deadly con?ict 
and nuclear proliferation – from 
Northrup Grumman and Leidos, 
to Boeing and Bechtel. Their 
products, such as laser-guided 
munitions, ?ghter jets, drones, 
and surveillance systems, are used 
in bombing campaigns in Yemen, 
Syria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. 
Millions of people have ?ed their 
homes or died as a result, all while 
the shareholders of TOC-attending 
companies rake in billions.
The situation with the TOC is 
a microcosm of a broader political 
crisis in the United States since the 
mid-20th century. As Howard Zinn 
writes in A People’s History of the 
United States: 
“[After World War II], U.S. busi-
ness leaders were so pleased with 
how the war stimulated industry 
that the president of General Elec-
tric [which regularly attends the 
TOC], Charles E. Wilson, suggest-
ed a continuing alliance between 
business and the military for ‘a per-
manent war economy.’ (p. 397)”
This war economy has expand-
ed despite the trend of Western 
governments increasingly turning 
to neoliberal “austerity” policies, 
especially since the 2007-2008 
global ?nancial crisis. As a result, 
national military budgets keep in-
creasing while vital social services, 
infrastructure spending, and envi-
ronmental protections are slashed. 
Meanwhile, the companies, insti-
tutions, and politicians responsible 
for this corruption face no conse-
quences. 
Recently, a representative from 
our group, Students for a Demo-
cratic Society, sat down with CIT 
Dean James Garrett to ask whether 
the TOC facilitators might consider 
disinviting war pro?teers this year. 
The Dean said that the companies 
that attend the conference simply 
respond to an open call from the 
university, and that the facilitators 
refuse to ban particular ?rms – as 
doing so would deprive students of 
the freedom to seek employment 
where they wish.
But this argument is a dodge, in 
that it of?oads responsibility for the 
Dean’s own decision to students. It 
isn’t as though every company in 
the world attends the TOC, offering 
students unlimited options. 
Rather, military contractors and 
weapons manufacturers are 
over-represented. Let’s be clear: 
in addition to its own wars in 
countries like Afghanistan and 
Iraq, the U.S. military is indirectly 
responsible for the violence meted 
out by the 73% of the world’s 
dictatorships it supports. Saudi 
Arabia, one such ally, has already 
killed tens of thousands of civilians 
in Yemen, in a war that has led to 
“the world's worst humanitarian 
crisis, with more than 22 million 
people – three-quarters of the 
population – in desperate need 
of aid and protection, according 
to the UN.” In the past, the Saudi 
royal family also looked the other 
way as wealthy ?gures connected 
to its regime sent money and arms 
to al-Qaeda and ISIS. 
So, to recap: companies wel-
comed with open arms to our 
campus each year are doing busi-
ness with the U.S. and Saudi mili-
taries, who in turn are supporting 
dictatorships and terrorist groups, 
respectively. If Carnegie Mellon 
higher-ups agree with this business 
model, they should say so directly 
and explain why – instead of blam-
ing students for jumping at lucra-
tive opportunities dangled in front 
of their faces.  
Ironically, our university’s 
founder, Andrew Carnegie, was 
a staunch anti-war advocate. In 
1910, Carnegie created the Carn-
egie Endowment for International 
Peace, a think-tank committed 
to “the abolition of international 
war.” Carnegie believed that war 
was “the foulest blot upon our civi-
lization.” What Carnegie failed to 
see then – and what our college 
and university administrators fail 
to see now – was the essential con-
nection between war and big busi-
ness. War is immensely pro?table, 
especially when it results in the 
toppling of governments that are 
unfriendly to U.S. business inter-
ests. But regardless of its outcome, 
war is an economic end in itself. It 
makes money for those building 
the weapons, those ?nancing the 
weapons-makers, those broadcast-
ing the violence in the media, and, 
increasingly, for the private militias 
actually ?ghting on the ground. 
It isn’t surprising that Andrew 
Carnegie overlooked these eco-
nomic factors. As a robber baron 
who mistreated workers and bust-
ed their unions, Carnegie wanted 
to abolish war without addressing 
its connections to an economic 
system he was personally pro?t-
ing from. Dean Garrett refuses to 
address one of those connections 
on our campus nowadays, and 
through his inaction, he is drafting 
Carnegie Mellon students into the 
wars of the future.
The good news is that there 
is still time to say “no” to defense 
contractors. Were the TOC facilita-
tors to do so, they would not ?nd 
themselves in a lonely position in 
the world of tech. Earlier this year, 
more than 3,000 Google employees 
joined the successful call to end the 
company’s contract with the DoD, 
Project Maven, which would use AI 
to improve drone targeting. More 
than 100 at Amazon signed a letter 
protesting the company’s sale of fa-
cial recognition software to police 
departments as well as its work for 
Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment (ICE), which is right now 
keeping more than 2,000 children 
in detention camps. This followed 
over 100 Microsoft employees’ pro-
test of their company’s cloud com-
puting contract with ICE. 
These brave and principled 
workers already have the sorts 
of jobs that students at Carnegie 
Mellon are right now studying 
and striving to obtain. However, 
too many of us end up recruited to 
build tools for bombings, surveil-
lance, and deportations. The ulti-
mate blame for this lies with our 
administrators and their laissez-
faire policies. But it’s on us, the 
student body, to tell them that we 
see them, that we object to their 
decisions, and that we refuse to en-
able war without even debating it.

From SDS, to CMU: ban war pro?teers from the TOC this year
LAUREN KELLY
Junior Staffwriter
Donald Trump was right. 
Wednesday evening, The New York 
Times released an op-ed validat-
ing Trump’s paranoia. The op-ed 
was anonymously written by a 
senior-level of?cial in the Trump 
White House, con?rming a strat-
egy of containment for the man 
inhabiting the oval. This uniden-
ti?ed senior of?cial in the Trump 
White House has made it clear 
that they are not a part of the 
popular left resistance, but a resis-
tance to Trump’s amoral and anti-
democratic behaviors.
For the past two days, news 
organizations around the world 
have proudly argued that this 
op-ed will lead to a blue tsunami 
come November. While the anon-
ymous op-ed is certainly damn-
ing, the impact it will have on the 
midterm elections is questionable. 
The midterms are only a few short 
months away, but it is likely that 
voters will forget this incident giv-
en the chaos ensuing within the 
Trump administration on a week-
ly basis. By November, this op-ed 
will surely be masked by other 
Trump-related scandals.
Not only will the anonymous 
op-ed be old news by November, 
it will actually strengthen Donald 
Trump’s base. For the past two 
years, his base has listened to him 
spout endless lies. They defend 
his mistruths and “alterna-
tive facts” as if they have 
been hypnotized to do so. 
This shocking op-ed 
only supports what 
he has been telling 
his base all along: 
there are people 
working for him 
in the White 
House who are 
trying to under-
mine his presidency. He was not 
wrong. There are people working 
around the clock to keep the Presi-
dent’s impulsive mind at bay.
Although this op-ed from 
within the administration will 
strengthen Trump’s main base, 
there is a very real possibility 
that it will push people towards 
the Democrats. There are an 
increasing number of Republicans 
ready to cut ties with Trump, 
which may lead some moderate 
Republicans to vote for Democrats 
in the midterms. Surely, this op-ed 
could push some frustrated voters 
to the left, but it may come as a 
sign of reassurance and relief for 
Republicans that do not support 
Trump, but support a conservative 
agenda.
While the motives of this op-ed 
are quite questionable, the piece 
tells the American public what 
we already knew: Donald Trump 
does not and will not put the 
country ?rst. Because our nation 
is so divided, it is likely that this 
op-ed will be perceived 
in a variety of ways. 
Democrats will 
take this article and run with it, 
exclaiming that Trump is un?t 
for of?ce. On the other hand, 
Republicans may read the op-ed 
and take comfort in knowing that 
there are “adults in the room” who 
will support true conservatism. 
We should question the underlying 
motives of this anonymous author, 
as he or she may be hinting at 
Republicans who have lost their 
faith to vote for Republicans in the 
fall. Either way, this op-ed creates 
more space in the ever-growing 
political divide currently taking 
place in the country.
Many have gone so far as to 
call this unnamed author a hero, 
which is a huge stretch. Yes, it is 
incredible that a senior White 
House of?cial worked with the 
so-called “enemy of the people” 
to release an op-ed con?rming 
what most of the American public 
already knew, but it is not enough 
to be called an “unsung hero.” If 
these people working in the White 
House were real heroes, they 
would not have just “whispered” 
about invoking the 25th amend-
ment to remove the President, 
they would have actually invoked 
it. If this unnamed author were a 
hero, they would have included 
their name and dealt with 
the consequences. Ap-
parently, that is all too 
much to ask.
Let’s de?ne the 
term “popular ?lm”
IZZY SIO
Pillbox Editor
Over brunch on Saturday, I was 
discussing with a friend on how it 
is dif?cult to de?ne and determine 
“popularity” in college. The 
concept of “popularity” hadn’t even 
crossed my mind during my three 
years at Carnegie Mellon, partly 
because popularity is so heavily 
broken down and circumstantial. 
Popularity mostly inhabited people 
within organizations – they’d won 
the most awards, participated the 
most, devoted a lot of time to said 
organization, or were just likable 
and friendly people. There weren’t 
many people whose popularity 
extended outside of the organization; 
if anything, their organization 
was more of a tool to help people 
remember who they were and what 
they do. Unlike high school, there 
was no list nor guidebook as to who 
was popular or how to be popular 
in college; in fact, individuality 
was respected the most more than 
anything.
There are a lot of problems with 
the inclusion of a “Popular Oscar,” 
formally known as the “Outstanding 
Achievement in Popular Film” 
category, within the lineup of the 
Academy Awards. It put all eligible 
and already released movies in a 
weird place and a hot spotlight when 
it was ?rst announced, creating a 
singled out and very clear division on 
what was a “Best Picture” contender 
and what was a “Best Popular Film” 
contender. It exposed the Academy of 
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as 
an organization struggling to remain 
relevant, announcing other changes 
when the category was announced 
that month such as a shortened 
broadcast time in order to appeal 
to viewers. It took some class out of 
the Academy, making next year’s 
Oscars feel more like the Kids’ Choice 
Awards and reminding us that, above 
all else, the Oscars will still always be 
a production more than an award 
show.
There are two big problems that 
arise the most from the various issues 
of the “Outstanding Achievement in 
Popular Film” award, the ?rst being: 
what is “popular ?lm”? More speci?-
cally, what is popular? Is it measured 
by a ?lm’s news coverage, and how 
much buzz it builds up before awards 
season? Is it measured by a ?lm’s 
?nancial performance, or by how 
much it makes during its opening 
weekend and its drop rate thereaf-
ter? Is it measured by a ?lm’s critical 
acclaim, and its stellar reviews from 
audiences, since incorporating critics 
into this potential de?nition would 
just be the method in how Academy 
voters determine “Best Picture?”
Academy President John Bailey 
and Academy CEO Dawn Hudson 
noted that they were still working on 
de?ning what constituted a “popular 
?lm,” and it is perhaps that uncertain-
ty that made the reception to the cat-
egory worse. If “popular ?lm” is de-
?ned by news coverage, then winners 
would be fairly easy to identify and 
the actual content of the ?lm could 
be overlooked. If “popular ?lm” is de-
?ned by ?nancial performance, then 
a range or a benchmark would need 
to be set in place. However, that also 
vastly limits the ?eld of nominees and 
puts more pressure and emphasis on 
the dollar in Hollywood, the latter 
which is a larger problem throughout 
?lm. If “popular ?lm” is de?ned by 
critical reviews, whether it be from 
audience or from journalists, then 
this category really isn’t necessary.
The second problem is that the 
category devalues and delegitimizes 
“blockbuster movies.” While eligible, 
genre movies like science ?ction and 
fantasy that mostly are regulated to 
the Best Visual Effects categories, 
comedies of any kind on a small scale, 
surprise horror hits, or movies from 
larger franchises such as Marvel, DC, 
or Harry Potter rarely receive nomi-
nations for categories like Best Actor, 
Best Actress, Best Original Screen-
play, and Best Picture. Bailey and 
Hudson recognized that when think-
ing of creating this category. In an 
article from The Hollywood Reporter, 
Bailey said that the category “wasn’t 
some knee-jerk reaction to falling 
ratings or to ABC or to anything like 
that. It was real[ly] clear on the part 
of the board and the Academy that 
we needed somehow to make cer-
tain kinds of ?lms eligible for new 
awards.”
However, putting ?lms like 
Mission Impossible: Fallout, Crazy 
Rich Asians, A Quiet Place, or Black 
Panther into a playground of their 
own feels more like an insult to each 
?lm’s directors, cast, and crew. It 
makes the word “popular” feel like 
a stigma. It only furthers the belief 
that blockbuster, franchise ?lms can’t 
tell an actual story and are just cash 
grabs, when in reality the storytelling 
and thematic possibilities that some 
of these larger budget movies can 
convey and tell are endless, rich, and 
mind-blowing. The “popular Oscar” 
takes out the diversity that the Best 
Picture Oscar desperately needs, 
and neglects attributes of ?lm that 
make it meaningful and impactful to 
audience members.
Despite being the least-watched 
show in the history of the Academy, 
the 90th Academy Awards had actu-
ally made some progression in trying 
to break the barrier between “Oscar 
bait” movies and “popular ?lm.” Hor-
ror ?lm Get Out was nominated for 
four awards, winning one for Best 
Original Screenplay. In that same cat-
egory, Amazon romantic comedy The 
Big Sick also received a nomination. 
The most landmark of all, superhero 
western Logan received a nomination 
for Best Adapted Screenplay, becom-
ing the ?rst superhero movie to re-
ceive an Academy Award nomination 
outside of a technical category.
Even though the Academy post-
poned the category for this year’s 
awards ceremony last Thursday, their 
proposed ideas to help bridge this 
gap are still alarming. Whether they 
decide to reintroduce the idea in the 
future or quietly push it off to the side, 
the Academy should take the per-
spective of the people in mind to see 
what constitutes “popular” and apply 
it to their broadcast, not in their ?lm 
classi?cation.Connor McGaf?n/Junior Staff Artist

Living in space can be 
tough sometimes. You’re 
millions of miles from 
home. You’re stuck with 
your coworkers for long 
stretches of time. All 
of your food is suction-
wrapped and rationed. 
And sometimes, you wake 
up to ?nd out that your 
home is slowly leaking air.
On Aug. 30, the astro-
nauts aboard the Interna-
tional Space Station found 
out that they had been los-
ing air all night. According 
to cnet.com, ?ight control-
lers had been monitoring 
the drop in pressure and 
chose to let the astronauts 
sleep because the leak pre-
sented no danger at the 
time.
Once awake, the as-
tronauts began search-
ing for the source of the 
leak; the team consisted 
of commander Drew 
Feustel, ?ight engineers 
Ricky Arnold and Serena 
Auñón-Chancellor, as well 
as Alexander Gerst, Oleg 
Artemyev, and Sergey 
Prokopyev. They eventu-
ally found a 2 millimeter 
wide hole in a spacecraft 
attached to the Russian 
side of the station.
According to The 
Telegraph, Astronaut 
Alexander Gerst proceeded 
to plug the hole with some-
thing almost every person 
on this planet has access to 
— his own thumb.
It was effective, but 
perhaps not the “best 
remedy,” admits NASA’s 
ground control. The astro-
nauts later used Kapton 
tape and epoxy to seal the 
hole more permanently. 
Flight controllers contin-
ued to monitor the cabin 
and search for a long-term 
solution.
They also searched 
for the answer to another 
question — how did the 
hole get there?
The ?rst theory blamed 
either a micrometeorite 
or a piece of space debris. 
Although space debris 
has never caused any sig-
ni?cant damage before, 
experts have warned for 
years that it is only a mat-
ter of time. The sheer 
amount of junk makes such 
a collision inevitable; since 
1957, over 5,000 launches 
have resulted in more than 
23,000 objects in orbit 
around earth.
Additionally, many 
abandoned space-
craft have exploded or 
broken up, sending their 
pieces ?ying into space. 
Scientists estimate that 
there are 166 million piec-
es larger than 1 millimeter 
shooting through space 
at speeds of up to 30,000 
mph. Of those pieces, 
750,000 are estimated to 
be larger than 1 centime-
ter. At those speeds, space 
debris are capable of tear-
ing through spacecraft like 
a bullet through human 
?esh, lending this theory 
credibility.
More conspiratorial 
theories have also 
emerged. According to 
Smithsonian Magazine, 
the small hole could have 
been drilled. The head 
of Russia’s space agency, 
Dmitry Rogozin, was the 
?rst to make this claim.
“It is too early to say 
de?nitely what happened,” 
he told the TASS news 
agency. “But, it seems to be 
done by a faltering hand…
it is a technological error 
by a specialist. It was done 
by a human hand — there 
are traces of a drill sliding 
along the surface.”
So is there a saboteur 
aboard the ISS, biding 
their time and waiting 
for the opportune time to 
strike again? Possibly... but 
probably not.
It’s extremely dif?cult 
to drill a hole in zero 
gravity — nearly impossi-
ble, in fact. It’s much more 
likely that a worker on 
Earth accidentally created 
the hole during produc-
tion. One unnamed source 
suggests that the craft was 
damaged during testing at 
the Baikonur Cosmodrome 
in Kazakhstan, and some-
one hastily covered up the 
mistake.
Still, even if an astronaut 
somehow drilled the hole, 
their intentions were most 
likely not malicious. Rus-
sian politician Maxim 
Surayev says it is pos-
sible an astronaut became 
homesick and resorted 
to extreme measures in 
an attempt to get back to 
Earth. “We’re all human and 
anyone might want to go 
home,” Surayev said. “But 
this method is really low…
I wish to God that this is a 
production defect, although 
that’s very sad too — there’s 
been nothing like this in the 
history of Soyuz ships.”
The investigation is still 
ongoing, but for now the 
astronauts are in no danger. 
They will continue their du-
ties, and those of us on Earth 
can continue being grateful 
that we can’t lose our oxygen 
to holes smaller than the 
widths of our thumbs.

Carnegie Mellon-Pitt team gets $3.8M to study suicide
EMMA FLICKINGER
SciTech Editor
A $3.8 million grant 
from the National Institute 
for Mental Health (NIMH) 
has been awarded to 
Carnegie Mellon’s Marcel 
Just and the University 
of Pittsburgh’s David A. 
Brent, who will be using 
the grant to expand on 
their innovative research 
on how images of the brain 
can identify individuals 
with suicidal thoughts.
Their research, known 
as the Predicting Risk 
Imaging Suicidal Minds 
(PRISM) project, made 
headlines in 2017 when 
their initial ?ndings were 
published. In the study, 
they examined brain 
activity in suicidal and 
non-suicidal participants 
by comparing images of 
the brain’s response when 
participants heard positive 
words, negative words, 
and words related to sui-
cide. They identi?ed ?ve 
areas of the brain that 
were identi?ably differ-
ent between suicidal par-
ticipants and non-suicidal 
participants.
Brent and Just then 
trained a machine learn-
ing algorithm on the brain 
data, and tested it to see 
how well it could correctly 
categorize brain images as 
either suicidal or non-sui-
cidal; it returned results 
with 91 percent accuracy. 
When the algorithm was 
trained only on the data 
from suicidal brains, it 
identi?ed images with 94 
percent accuracy.
The NIMH grant will 
fund the research for a 
further ?ve years.
“The cornerstone of 
this project is our recent 
ability to identify what 
concept a person is think-
ing about based on its 
accompanying brain ac-
tivation pattern or neu-
ral signature,” said Just, 
the D.O. Hebb University 
Professor of Psychology 
in Dietrich College, in a 
university press release. 
“We were previously able 
to obtain consistent neu-
ral signatures to deter-
mine whether someone 
was thinking about objects 
like a banana or a hammer 
by examining their fMR 
brain activation patterns. 
But now we are able to 
tell whether someone is 
thinking about ‘trouble’ or 
‘death’ in an unusual way.”
One limitation of 
Just’s and Brent’s past 
research — as with many 
psychology studies — is 
their small sample size 
(34 participants). While 
this number was enough 
to provide valid results, 
in future work the greater 
number of participants al-
lowed by the NIMH fund-
ing will grant additional 
con?rmation and further 
insight, and allow them to 
compare imaging from pa-
tients with a greater range 
of different mental states 
to broaden the way they 
are able to interpret the 
images.
While it’s generally 
agreed that a way to track 
biological predictors of 
suicide is needed, some 
think the PRISM project 
isn’t the best solution.
Some cautioned 
against placing too much 
con?dence, too soon, in 
the machine learning 
approach. “They used 
a method called ‘cross 
validation’ to both train 
and test their machine 
learning algorithm on 
the same small data set,” 
explained Derek Hill, a 
professor of medical imag-
ing science at University 
College London. “While 
this is a widely used 
approach, it is not a true 
replication study, so it isn’t 
yet clear whether their al-
gorithm would work on 
another separate group of 
patients.”
The largest point of 
criticism, however, was 
the method’s applicability 
in a clinical setting. Brain 
imaging is expensive, and 
suicide is an extremely 
frequent problem. It’s un-
realistic to expect a switch 
to this advanced method 
from simple screening sur-
veys in the doctor’s of?ce. 
“In terms of predicting sui-
cide risk, it is unlikely to 
move the ?eld forward,” 
said psychiatrist Seena 
Fazel of the University of 
Oxford, in response to the 
2017 study.
However, if the PRISM 
method is implemented in 
a clinical setting, it could 
potentially help reduce the 
high number of false posi-
tives produced by standard 
screening surveys — as well 
as increase the accuracy of 
screenings. “Suicide is the 
second leading cause of 
death among young adults 
in the U.S., and current 
assessment methods rely 
entirely on patients self re-
porting and doctors’ obser-
vations,” said Brent. “Any 
new inroads to better diag-
nosis and treatment have 
the potential to save lives.”

Two centuries of time 
and effort, engulfed in a ?-
ery blaze. 20 million price-
less historical and scienti?c 
artifacts — gone.
On Sept. 2, the National 
Museum of Brazil in Rio 
de Janeiro burned to the 
ground, a national and in-
ternational tragedy so great 
that David Reich, a Harvard 
Medical School geneticist, 
said “It’s as if the Metropoli-
tan Museum of Art burned 
down.” The museum was a 
place where families could 
enjoy a fun and educational 
day, students could visit 
during school trips, and 
world-renowned paleontol-
ogists, anthropologists, and 
biologists could conduct 
research in the museum’s 
extensive archives.
The building that burned 
housed 90 percent of the 
museum’s complete collec-
tion, with some artifacts 
dating back millions of 
years, and provided a space 
for researchers to learn and 
discover new ancient spe-
cies and look back to put the 
present in context.
The museum specialized 
in Egyptian mummies, di-
nosaur fossils, and artifacts 
local to the region. With the 
?re, these irreplaceable ?g-
ments of history and science 
have been suddenly taken 
away. The disaster’s impact 
on research will begin to be 
realized in the coming years 
as this wealth of knowledge 
is no longer available.
In an article for The 
Washington Post, Antonio 
Carlos de Souza Lima, pro-
fessor of ethnology at the 
National Museum, wrote 
that “the destruction of the 
museum and its collections 
threatens Brazil’s ethnic 
minorities.” The museum 
provided a space to cultivate 
and protect the indigenous 
and black cultural history 
in Brazil and more broadly, 
South America. It worked 
with indigenous groups to 
document their cultural 
practices, music, and maps, 
and used af?rmative ac-
tion policies to ensure that 
native and minority Brazil-
ians would have a hand in 
recording their own history.
The museum is already 
planning to rebuild, so that 
it can continue its mission 
to preserve and promote 
cultural and scienti?c re-
search. But that costs money 
— as does digital archiving, 
which would provide “back-
up” to mitigate any future 
tragedies. While the cause 
of the ?re has not yet been 
determined, this event is 
a clear sign that we need 
better methods for conser-
vation and digitization.
As for the academics 
who worked in the museum, 
their life’s work has been 
lost. “It is very dif?cult to 
react to reality and try to 
return to life,” said linguist 
Bruna Franchetta, whose 
of?ce was destroyed, in a 
statement to WIRED.
Before the ?re, the mu-
seum was having funding 
dif?culties, ?ghting with 
different governments and 
the Federal University of 
Rio de Janeiro for resources. 
The museum had previously 
resorted to crowdfunding to 
repair the termite-infested 
base of a mounted dino-
saur. Museum communi-
ties around the world, and 
national and international 
institutions for art, history, 
and science must work to 
support the future of the 
museum, and the futures of 
all museums.
Those that criticize 
museums say they are stuck 
in the past, constantly mired 
by the beliefs, values, and 
perspectives of different 
eras. But they are essential 
to our history, and to our 
human understanding of 
ourselves and the world we 
live in. If we do not acknowl-
edge the past and seek to un-
derstand it, we are destined 
to repeat it.

The Athletic must promote new voices and markets
ATHLETIC, from A10
 While writers across 
the board continue to insist 
The Athletic is merely 
meant to be another option 
of ?nding sports cover-
age, the attitudes of the 
founders and the site itself 
are extremely aggressive.
But when perusing The 
Athletic web pages, the 
coverage looks incredibly 
similar to those of 
corresponding local paper 
sites. Also noteworthy, 
The Athletic does not 
provide any different or 
diverse voices. The website 
employs primarily white 
men, something pointed 
out time and time again 
by critics. Writers for the 
site tend to respond in 
the same way — that they 
realize this is an issue, and 
are looking into ?xing it. 
However, a year into their 
big boom, nothing has 
changed. In fact, a new hire 
was announced recently: a 
man to run and improve 
their fantasy sports cover-
age. And yet The Athletic 
still has no writers or 
mechanisms in place to 
cover women’s sports.
The lack of women 
on staff continues to be 
a concern for critics. In 
a Slate article published 
this month, Aaron Gordon 
puts it well: “It’s dif?cult to 
square the Athletic’s claim 
that it’s providing stories 
that readers cannot ?nd 
elsewhere with the fact 
that almost all of its writers 
and editors come from that 
most conventional of else-
wheres...At a time when 
sports and sports coverage 
are getting more diverse, 
the Athletic is harkening 
back to an era almost en-
tirely devoid of diversity.”
So why, then, can The 
Athletic claim to be the 
future of sports writing? 
The only revolutionary 
piece of their formula 
is charging people to 
read the same content 
they had been reading 
for years. There is no 
new perspective, as they 
continue to give jobs to 
those already established 
in the industry. In fact, 
thanks to The Athletic, you 
are more likely to ?nd new, 
fresh voices at your local 
papers as they replace 
those who have moved on.
For sports that are not as 
heavily in the mainstream, 
such as hockey or MLS, 
The Athletic is certainly 
something new with its 
more focused, speci?c 
content. Perhaps that is 
why the site has done 
particularly well among 
fans of the NHL, with near-
ly every premier hockey 
writer transitioning to The 
Athletic in the past year 
and a half, with multiple 
websites now focused on 
every Canadian market. 
But for old standards, 
industry veterans continue 
to carry the ?ag, leaving 
new, promising journalists 
in the dust.
There are many avenues 
a site like The Athletic could 
take. They could pioneer 
a focused method for 
writing on women’s sports, 
something that right now 
is mostly supported by 
espnW. They could give 
new writers a chance to 
excel in a format that 
prioritizes emotional 
and novel stories. They 
could use their now 
in?uence to 
try something new.
Until then, The Athletic 
will continue with the 
same trite formulas 
established for years by 
sports pages across 
the globe. Sure, 
the writing 
is good, 
but does that matter when 
it’s stale?

Junior Staffwriter
 Reading, PA is about an 
hour outside of Philadelphia. 
Lafayette College in Easton, 
PA is also about an hour 
outside of Philly. For the ?rst 
19 years of my life, it’s taken 
more time to get to and from 
a game at Citizens Bank Park 
— the Philadelphia Phillies 
stadium — than I’ve ever 
spent actually at the game. 
The experiences have been 
fun, sitting in a car with my 
brothers or friends bonding 
over the shared Hell that is 
sitting in sports event traf?c 
at 1 a.m., but it was time 
for a change. I’m over the 
suburbs.
I transferred to Carnegie 
Mellon after a year at 
Lafayette, and I now live 
in Oakland. Oakland is 
about 15 minutes outside 
of downtown Pittsburgh, 
and it’s another 10 minute 
walk across the bridge to 
reach PNC Park, home of 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. There 
are no more car rides with 
rocking tunes or intense 
bonding experiences in 
an encapsulated space 
with people you already 
intensely trust, but the city 
offers a different viewing 
experience of baseball. 
Baseball is always more than 
just the game. Every third 
think piece about baseball 
analyzes the sights and 
sounds and smells of the 
game, but the experience 
begins by deciding to 
actually go to a game.
I chose Labor Day, Sept. 3 
this year, to see an afternoon 
game at the park, and it took 
me all of thirty minutes 
to reach the stadium, in 
spite of Labor Day parades 
rerouting the buses. Walking 
across the Roberto Clemente 
Bridge with a multitude 
of other fans as the water 
sparkles from the sun in the 
heat of the day is a uniquely 
Pittsburghian experience 
that every baseball fan 
should enjoy some day. 
PNC Park itself is a beautiful 
stadium, with an out?eld 
porch under tree cover that 
looks with an unimpeded 
view on the river and city, 
and has one of the best 
views in baseball for those 
sitting behind home plate, 
with downtown Pittsburgh 
gracefully rising behind the 
center ?eld wall.
As for the game, it 
was hot. There was little 
resistance to the beating 
rays of the sun, and there 
was little resistance from 
the Reds in the game. With 
a ?nal score of 5-1, the 
Pirates handily defeated 
the Cincinnati Reds to put 
another win under their 
belt, inching back towards 
.500. Adam Frazier went 
four for four with two runs 
scored and three runs batted 
in, and Gregory Polanco was 
two for four with one run 
scored and two batted in. 
The star of the game, how-
ever, was Pirates pitcher 
Trevor Williams, who threw 
six-and-two-thirds innings, 
giving up only ?ve hits and 
one walk. Earning himself a 
quality start, Williams gave 
up no runs in the innings 
he pitched, and a gracious 
Pirates crowd gave him a 
standing ovation on his 
way off the mound. Most 
contacts that Reds hitters 
made against Williams 
stayed close to the in?eld, 
save a surprising Billy 
Hamilton ?y ball to center 
?eld. For a ?rst experience 
at PNC Park, I’m glad the 
Pirates won, but the game is 
just another of the long list 
of statistics in the annals of 
baseball history.
Something important 
happened at the game, 
though, that I’m sure 
happens across America, 
but is the reason why people 
will always come back to 
baseball. My seat was right 
under the left ?eld foul pole, 
about one hundred paces 
away from left ?elder Corey 
Dickerson, but the heat was 
too much for me in that seat. 
I moved under cover, and 
there, in the ?rst row of the 
out?eld seats, was a little 
boy wearing a Dickerson 
jersey. Around the seventh 
inning the boy’s mother said 
it was time to go, that the 
sun was too much, but the 
little boy convinced her to 
stay a while longer: “What if 
the Pirates hit thirteen home 
runs in a row?”
This is why so many 
Americans love baseball. 
It’s a working man’s sport 
that requires effort day 
in and day out, every day 
of the summer, but you 
never know what you’re 
going to ?nd at the park. 
There could be a once in a 
lifetime opportunity — a 
perfect game — or a banal 
experience that hits the right 
mark and leaves a lasting 
memory. Perhaps, some-
thing like a little kid wearing 
his favorite ball player’s 
jersey whose just twenty feet 
away.

The Carnegie Mellon 
University volleyball team 
welcomed Washington 
& Jefferson College in its 
home opener, beating the 
Presidents in straight sets. 
With its victory, the 24th-
ranked Tartans moved to a 
2–2 overall record on the 
season.
The Presidents started 
the ?rst set hot, winning 
a long opening rally. They 
outscored the Tartans 
5–1, but the home team 
fought back throughout 
the set, trading shots with 
the visitors. The Tartans 
tied the score at 17–17. 
A service ace by junior 
Maia So-Holloway gave 
the Tartans their ?rst lead 
of the match. After some 
back-and-forth points, the 
Tartans took the set 27–25.
Like in the ?rst set, the 
Presidents kicked off the 
scoring, 3–0. This time, 
however, the Tartans 
quickly took control, going 
on a 6–0 run to make the 
score 6–3. The Presidents 
fought back to cut their 
de?cit to one point, 8–7, 
but were unable to match 
the Tartans’ dominant 
attack. The Tartans led by 
as much as 14 points during 
the set and won 25–12.
The third set began with 
a long rally that covered 
all corners of the court, 
the point ultimately going 
to the Tartans with a kill 
by senior Sarah Jurgens. 
After a Tartan service 
error, they ?red off seven 
straight points to lead 8–1. 
After leading 16–9 later 
in the set, the Tartans are 
held from scoring by the 
Presidents, who scored 
seven straight points of 
their own to tie 16–16. The 
Presidents took their ?rst 
lead of the set 20–19, but 
the Tartans surged at the 
end to win the set 25–21 
and put the match away 
three sets to zero.
Overall, the teams’ ?nal 
stat lines were similar. The 
Tartans ?nished with a .138 
hitting average, 68 digs, 
six blocks, and eight aces, 
while the Presidents put 
up a .063 hitting average, 
65 digs, six blocks, and 
three aces. Nine Tartans 
recorded kills, Jurgens 
leading the way with 11. 
Of the team’s 36 assists, 
So-Holloway recorded 
33 of them, while senior 
Lauren Mueller registered 
a match-high four service 
aces. Junior libero Kayla 
Yew also led both teams 
with a season-high 23 digs, 
followed by 13 from senior 
Sydney Bauer and 10 from 
Mueller for the Tartans.
After three losses at the 
Juniata Asics Invitational 
over the weekend to 
third-ranked Wittenberg 
University, Christopher 
Newport University, 
and Juniata College, the 
Tartans look to bounce 
back at Saint Vincent 
College on Tuesday, Sept. 8 
at 7 p.m.

After a week of 
temperatures consistently 
climbing into the nineties, 
the Carnegie Mellon 
University men’s soccer 
team took to the field 
on a cool night to face 
off against the Lycoming 
College Warriors. Clouds 
were rolling in as a rousing 
rendition of the national 
anthem was performed 
by the Carnegie Mellon 
University public address 
system. The threat of rain 
was persistent through-
out the night, but it held 
off for the entire game. 
The Tartans were also 
able to just hold off the 
Warriors in a 2–1 victory, 
putting their record at 
2–0–1 for the season, af-
ter two double overtime 
games against Kenyon and 
Denison Colleges.
The first seconds after 
kickoff were indicative of 
the game to come, with 
Lycoming launching the 
ball over the top only 
to have it headed away 
by a Tartan defender. 
The Tartans controlled 
possession back up the 
field, where an awkward 
call by the referee led to 
a Tartan free kick that 
was punched away by 
the opposing keeper. As 
the game began to settle 
down around the fifteenth 
minute, the Tartans’ ability 
to outpossess the Warriors 
became evident, but the 
Warriors used their size 
and strength to stay in the 
game.
Coaches love to use 
the cliche, “Let the other 
team make mistakes,” 
but there is some truth to 
every cliche: teams need 
to play safe but capitalize 
on opponent’s weaknesses 
and errors. For the first 
half, each team played 
safe. The Tartans and 
Warriors played to their 
own strengths to outweigh 
each other, but each 
team’s strength in scrappy, 
physical soccer led to an 
increasingly chippy game. 
There were 17 fouls by 
each team, but only one 
yellow card was given. 
The referees were allowing 
the teams to play, but a 
handful of missed calls 
and wrong calls pushed 
the teams to get into the 
faces of their opponents 
and the refs. The first half 
ended in tepid fashion 
with the ball at midfield, 
but immediately after a 
handful of players were in 
the referee’s face.
The second half started 
with a bang. Lycoming 
was pushing hard against 
the Tartan’s possession in 
the back field, but were 
opened up to some quick 
switches up the field by 
the Tartans leading to a 
cross by senior forward 
Anthony Gulli landing 
on senior forward Zack 
Masciopinto’s forehead at 
the penalty mark for a snap 
finish into the far upper 
corner of the side netting. 
The Tartans were able to 
keep up the pressure on 
Lycoming just after the 
goal, forcing a corner 
moments later. A perfect 
ball was played into the 
box, but a head bounced it 
out to the opposite side for 
Gulli to play a cross towards 
the back post, where the 
Lycoming keeper fumbled 
the ball allowing it to drop 
and roll just across the line 
for a goal.
By the sixtieth minute, 
the score was 2–0 for the 
Tartans, and they started to 
slide into a more defensive 
game to help retain some 
control, until the last five 
minutes. Lycoming started 
pushing their attacking 
midfielders up to the line 
of the Tartan defense; the 
Tartans could only clear 
Lycoming attacks as far as 
their defenders, who just 
played the ball back over 
the top. Eventually the ball 
went out for a Lycoming 
corner that dropped to 
the ground between the 
Tartans’ senior keeper Alec 
Lam, and an attacking 
player who crashed into 
Lam. A foul was called, 
and the attack quelled for 
a minute.
Later, a Lycoming cross 
was played to the far side 
of the box and headed just 
over the Tartan defenders. 
Lam rushed out to prevent 
a goal, and the Lycoming 
attacker crashed into 
Lam, with both hitting 
the ground hard and the 
ball careening out to the 
opposite side of the box, 
where a Tartan defender 
tackled a Lycoming 
attacker from behind. 
A penalty was called, 
taken, and then finished 
by Lycoming to make the 
score 2–1. The players on 
the field rushed into the 
net, and a scuffle ensued. 
The referee had no control 
for the last three minutes of 
the game, but the Tartans 
were able to fight off a 
physically strong Lycoming 
Warriors team. In classic 
Tartan fashion, their heart 
was in the work, but their 
brains won them the game.
After a commanding 
win at La Roche College on 
Sunday night, the Tartans 
will next face Westminster 
College on Friday, Sept. 14 
at 7:30 p.m.

 On The Athletic’s 
home page, a heavy font 
proclaims it loudly as: “The 
New Standard of Sports 
Journalism.” Above it are 
the topics you can explore: 
from the USA to Canada, 
the site boasts exclusive 
hockey, football, baseball, 
and college sports cover-
age. Even just glancing at 
the contributors, there are 
plenty of instantly recogniz-
able names for even casual 
purveyors of sports media. 
For all intents and purposes, 
it seems like a sports fan’s 
dream.
Except that it costs $60 a 
year.
So what is the new 
standard of sports journal-
ism exactly? And why are 
the founders so con?dent 
they can convince sports 
fans across North America 
to reach into their wallets?
Part of this con?dence 
draws directly from the 
entire reason The Athletic 
is able to boast such an 
impressive roster. In mid-
2017, sports writers across 
the country were laid 
off as some of the bigger 
networks, like ESPN and Fox 
Sports, started the process 
of pivoting to mostly video 
content. These writers, left 
without anywhere to go, 
immediately latched onto 
The Athletic, founded in 
Jan. 2016. Although the 
site began in Chicago, it has 
since spread to 38 markets, 
covering nearly every major 
sports team in the country.
By all accounts, the 
writing at The Athletic is 
strong. There are almost 150 
writers on staff, and nearly 
all are well established 
in their ?eld. A limited 
selection of articles are 
released free to the public, 
but these often show a high 
level of journalism that is 
thought provoking, if not 
worth the investment.
Especially within 
Pittsburgh, the idea of a 
subscription sports website 
is nothing new. Sports 
writer Dejan Kovacevic 
launched DK Pittsburgh 
Sports in 2014, marketed as 
a subscription-based website 
providing sports coverage 
for the greater Pittsburgh 
area. For a while, this was a 
revolutionary business plan, 
and he received much of the 
same criticism now directed 
toward The Athletic. 
According to Kovacevic, The 
Athletic promised not to 
start a Pittsburgh site. How-
ever, the site premiered their 
Pittsburgh coverage earlier 
this year, and currently 
employs two previous 
employees of Kovacevic.
The problem is, The 
Athletic doesn’t challenge 
any of the conventional 
tropes of mainstream sports 
journalism. They do not offer 
their subscribers anything 
that cannot be provided 
from local papers. And yet 
in a 2017 interview for The 
New York Times, co-founder 
Alex Mather stated, “We will 
wait every local paper out 
and let them continuously 
bleed until we are the last 
ones standing. We will 
suck them dry of their best 
talent at every moment.” 
This predatory mindset has 
become a rallying point for 
critics of the subscription 
site.

You’ve seen it by now, 
right? The big close-up of 
the former quarterback’s 
face, overlaid with the words 
“Believe in something, 
even if it means sacri?cing 
everything.” It’s another 
controversial marketing 
decision by Nike, but what 
does Nike’s support truly 
mean for Colin Kaepernick’s 
message?
The ad came out just a few 
days after it was announced 
that Kaepernick, former San 
Francisco 49ers quarterback 
and pioneer of the divisive 
anti-police-brutality protests 
during the national anthem 
of NFL football games, was 
to become the face of Nike’s 
newest ad campaign. You 
know the story by now. 
Kaepernick began the pro-
tests back in 2016, sitting on 
the bench during the Star-
Spangled Banner in the ?rst 
few preseason games. Kae-
pernick, in talking to U.S. 
military veterans, decided 
to switch to kneeling during 
the anthem proceedings, as 
it was seen as more respect-
ful to the ?ag than simply 
sitting.
Kaepernick’s teammate, 
Eric Reid, joined the 
quarterback in kneel-
ing during the anthem in 
solidarity, and soon play-
ers from around the league 
were kneeling left and right, 
hoping that their position as 
entertainment ?gureheads 
would help their protests 
against wrongful police 
brutality and poor prison 
conditions gain traction.
Boy, did they. Just not in 
the way they expected.
The protests were met 
with a vehement back-
lash. With the election of 
President Trump, more and 
more NFL players started to 
kneel or sit for the anthem, 
showing their displeasure 
with the president. He 
took to Twitter, calling out 
the athletes for a lack of 
patriotism and disrespect 
for America. Many of his 
supporters agreed with him, 
saying that the protests were 
ridiculous. Trump’s tweets 
showed a complete lack of 
understanding for what 
the players’ message really 
was. To him, the kneeling 
was an attack on America 
and, by extension, an attack 
on him. Support rang out 
from middle America, with 
football fans defaming and 
boycotting the league. Many 
former fans went so far as to 
burn their team’s apparel, 
which, you know, didn’t 
really do anything except 
waste money that they had 
already spent.
The NFL season went 
on as scheduled in the 
2017 season, with ?are ups 
coming and going as people 
remembered to be angry 
about something that they 
didn’t care or try to under-
stand the point of. In the off-
season this past year, the NFL 
owners attempted to make 
it ?neable and suspendable 
to protest during the play-
ing of the national anthem. 
The NFL Players Association 
took grievance with the 
movement, saying that it 
was unconstitutional and 
just generally messed up. 
These talks are still ongoing, 
and the anthem protest ban 
has been halted at this point.
Nike’s role in all of this is 
a curious one; it seems that 
executives are banking on 
young liberals who support 
the protests to love that a 
big corporation backed up 
a controversial subject. It’s 
a marketing scheme. Nike 
has sweatshops all over 
Asia. They’re not a beacon of 
moral good by any stretch of 
the imagination, but riding 
the coattails of someone 
who put his career on the 
line to stand against injustice 
is good for business. Still, 
Nike has a unique position, 
as they hold the exclusive 
uniform contracts for all 
32 NFL teams, and they’re 
a gigantic sponsor of the 
NFL and anything football 
related.
Kaepernick remains out 
of a job and is ?ghting the 
NFL owners in a collusion 
lawsuit, arguing that the 
NFL teams collectively 
decided not to offer him a 
place on a team because 
of his outspoken political 
beliefs and actions. With 
some of the quarterbacks 
starting this week’s opening 
games, it’s clear to see that 
it’s likely true (looking at 
you, Nathan Peterman).
Now, the problem is that 
the same former NFL fans 
who burned jerseys and 
memorabilia are doing the 
same to their Nike gear. 
Again, this doesn’t make 
any sense and is just a waste 
of perfectly good clothing, 
but go off, I guess? Fans 
are simply outraged for the 
sake of being outraged. The 
First Amendment of the 
Constitution is about free-
dom of speech, assembly, 
and press. There’s no good 
reason Kaepernick should be 
out of a job at the NFL level 
for expressing his beliefs.
There’s absolutely no rea-
son that NFL fans should be 
boycotting Nike’s products. 
People who are upset about 
this have things backward. 
Regardless of your views 
on things like police brutal-
ity and for-pro?t prisons, 
Kaepernick, and all the 
NFL players, have a right as 
citizens of the United States 
to use their platform as 
famous athletes to protest 
racism in this country, with-
out fear of losing their jobs.
It’s 2018, folks. It’s time 
to wake up.
The Athletic’s business model is shortsighted and stale

On dealing with your heavy workload this week 
Dear Michelle,
I’m a mess. I already have so many assignments 
due, and we’re only going into the THIRD WEEK 
OF SCHOOL. I’ve been given exam reviews (for 
which exams and when!?) and several big 
homework assignments due this week have been 
popping up on Canvas out of nowhere! I can’t 
even look at them!! This is crazy, and the worst 
part is that I’m terrible at time management! 
I’ve never been good at it, but somehow I was 
able to get by in high school. It’s basically 
habitual for me to leave any assignment to the 
last minute, but I mean … isn’t that normal for 
students? I also feel like everyone around me 
is terrible at time management too, even the 
upperclassmen! What I don’t get is, how do they 
do it? How are they able to manage everything? 
Like, I guess a lot of people pull all-nighters 
to finish their work, but I really don’t feel like 
doing that. And yet, how else am I supposed 
to finish all the work I have this week? Ugh, 
procrastination is going to kill me! 
I really did play myself,
Cannot Remember Any Motivation
Dear CRAM,
I understand that everything may feel 
overwhelming at the moment, but I suggest you 
first just take a deep breath and try to calm 
down. You definitely don’t have to do anything 
you don’t want to do (like pull an all-nighter). 
I know it might be hard to believe, but you can 
still manage to finish all your work at reasonable 
times this week. It just requires you putting in a 
bit of effort to find good times to complete your 
work.
First, you should log back into Canvas and 
actually look at and write down all the dates 
of your upcoming assignments. At least then, 
you’ll know how much time you have left to work 
on each assignment. Then, after you read this 
advice column, figure out when during the week 
you have time to work on your assignments. 
Having your own personal calendar that includes 
all your extracurriculars, classes, leisure times 
and such is really helpful for planning this kind of 
stuff out! If you haven’t made one yet, definitely 
find time to do so (after you’ve finished all your 
work this week). 
You might also want to consider how you’re 
going to finish each of your assignments. 
Does one homework require using some weird 
program that you don’t have easy access to? 
Will you need to collaborate with others on 
another assignment?
Last thing is to make a list for yourself of each 
day this week. Grab a piece of paper, and write 
down all of the things you want to accomplish 
(for both academics and social activities) in 
each day. This will also help you prioritize your 
assignments, along with the other stuff you have 
to get done in the week. It’s also really satisfying 
to check things off your list when you’re done. 
Getting into these organizational habits can, 
at least in my experience, reduce some of your 
stress and make getting work done during the 
week easier. 
I hope this helps!

Izzy Sio & Michelle Madlansacay | Pillbox EditorsBrunch Buddies: Bangkok Balcony
Head over to Bangkok Balcony for a classy setting and meal
Full disclosure: The majority of The Tartan staff is 
under 21, so bars, unfortunately, aren’t an option 
for us to continue with Bar Buddies. For the first 
edition of the new year and semester, we decided 
to start exploring other cool restaurants and places 
in Pittsburgh that offer not just drinks but also some 
pretty good food. For our first newly regular Brunch 
Buddies, we decided to break away from some 
traditional brunch conventions and head down to 
Bangkok Balcony, a solid Squirrel Hill favorite.
The location: As previously mentioned, Bangkok 
Balcony is located in Squirrel Hill, right in the 
middle of the upper Forbes Avenue addresses. 
There are a lot of Asian restaurants in Squirrel 
Hill, but Bangkok Balcony stands out because of its 
setup; as befitting its name, Bangkok Balcony’s front 
door opens to a flight of stairs that lead you to the 
restaurant, located above an Asian supermarket. Its 
neon lights and signs make the restaurant look cool 
and trendy, yet approachable and easy to walk 
into if you’re simply strolling down Forbes Avenue 
looking for a place to eat.
The food: We both ordered some of Bangkok 
Balcony’s lunch specials, and I (Izzy) also ordered 
an appetizer: steamed pork and shrimp dumplings. 
The dumplings were hot, fresh, and had a bit 
of a homey flavor to them that was surprisingly 
comforting. It stayed even after the dumplings had 
dried out after a few minutes as we were talking 
during brunch. 
The Pad See Ew lunch special looked kind of small 
when I first got it, but its flavor made up for its size. 
Additionally, you could also adjust the spice level 
of the food: while we both ordered our food at 
the lowest spice level possible, it did not seem to 
change the flavor that much at all for the Pad See 
Ew, and when I was nearly finished I was tempted 
to order another small portion to take home.
I (Michelle) ordered the green curry with rice, 
and to be honest, it’s one of my favorite things on 
the menu. I went to Bangkok Balcony for the first 
time this summer, and my friend had me try the 
curry when she ordered that time. The flavor of 
the curry was just so unique, where you can taste 
the sweetness of the coconut milk with a little bit of 
spice. The chicken was very tender, and that helped 
contrast with the crunchiness of the snow peas, 
broccoli, and green beans. Although both our main 
dishes took a while to come, I think the wait was 
definitely worth it. The lunch specials each come 
with a soup, salad, and a spring roll.
The vibe: The restaurant was surprisingly not very 
crowded when we went, which was around 1 p.m. 
on a Saturday. The waiters basically seated all 
the customers by the huge window, so half of the 
restaurant had people sitting and eating and the 
other half was pretty much empty. Overall, the 
vibe of the place was very relaxed because there 
weren’t many people, which was great for brunch/
lunch time.
Lit or nah: I don’t think you’ll find a very upbeat 
and lively environment by going to Bangkok 
Balcony for lunch on a weekend. Even though 
there’s a nice bar, most of the customers around 
this time were having very casual conversations 
over lunch, with a nice glass of wine on the side for 
some. 
Maybe around dinnertime there’s more of a night 
life, but for the most part, Bangkok Balcony gave 
off more classy vibes than anything else.

Everything Is Terrible! is 
the video collective known 
for discovering some of 
the most campy, wild, 
and just plain weird VHS 
footage. 
They upload these found footage clips, 
sometimes edited for comedic effect, to 
the internet every weekday and have 
produced several viral hits like “DUANE!!!” 
and “So Your Cat Wants A Massage?” 
They are also known for extravagant 
live shows and for their ongoing effort 
to construct a giant pyramid out of VHS 
copies of the movie Jerry Maguire. They 
were recently in Pittsburgh touring their 
show “The Great Satan” for the second 
time. The Tartan got the chance to catch 
up with one of the members of the 
collective, Commodore Gilgamesh.
Brooke Ley: How has the tour been 
going so far?
Commodore Gilgamesh: We’re just 
starting it, but we have done this show 
before. We did a tour with it and it was 
great which is why it is back by popular 
demand.
BL: Nice! Yeah, I actually went to see you 
guys whenever you were in Pittsburgh 
before. Now you’re at a different location. 
Instead of at the Carnegie Stage you’re at 
Row House Cinema in Lawrenceville.
CG: Yeah, which is why we’re really happy 
to come back because we kind of felt like 
a lot of people didn’t want to go out to 
the ‘burbs to the community theater out 
there, so I think a lot of people are happy 
that we’re coming to the city proper.
BL: Definitely. So, did you decide to revive 
the show because of demand or were you 
looking to, I guess, do more stuff? Is there 
anything we can expect to be different this 
time around?
CG: Yeah, it is slightly different. It is always 
evolving, but it is basically the same show 
which we just brought back because we 
sold out so many shows. People were just 
begging us to bring it back, so we caved. 
Pittsburgh is one of those place where we 
were turning people away.
BL: Why do you guys decide to tour this 
movie? Instead of it being just this film it’s 
this sort of live performance, I suppose, 
that goes along with it. What was the 
inspiration for that?
CG: We’ve been doing this for, you know, 
the actual shows 8 or 9 years now. In the 
very beginning, we were asked to do film 
festivals to screen our movies, and they 
would fly you out to talk, and we always 
thought that that was pretty boring. We 
always laughed whenever filmmakers 
started to talk. We just pretty much 
decided to start building universes around 
the features that we made and create 
a much more robust experience for our 
viewers. It has just grown from there, and 
now, I mean, if we didn’t come people 
would be pissed. They’d be confused and 
pissed, so we have no choice but to keep 
making it crazier and bigger as we go. 
BL: Definitely.
CG: We love it. I mean, we love building 
stuff, we love performing, so it’s just like 
each thing feeds into the other thing.
BL: Yeah! The shows are great. They’re 
big and crazy, and one of my favorite 
parts is the costumes of it and the 
characters behind it. What were some 
of the inspirations for the costumes and 
is that something that people within 
Everything Is Terrible! work to design or 
is that something that you have another 
artist help you guys out to do.
CG: No, we do everything. It’s all us. I 
designed and built those costumes with a 
few others of the collective. It’s so fun. It’s 
basically stuff that we’ve just experiment 
with and taught ourselves how to do. 
Most of us don’t really have any, like, 
formal training on like editing video and 
we don’t have any formal performance 
or costuming or anything else so we just 
have sort of made everything up as we’ve 
gone. It’s just been a fun universe that we 
can experiment within. Whenever we just 
come up with some dumb new thing that 
we want to try to do we just push it into 
the world that we’re making, and people 
accept it which is insane! We’re always 
expecting people to be like “that’s too 
much you guys need to stop,” but our fans 
are always down which is amazing.
BL: Yeah, speaking of wild projects that 
might not have stuck but your fans have 
got into, you guys have the Jerry Maguire 
pyramid going up and are working to 
collect all of the Jerry Maguire VHS tapes. 
How’s that project going?
CG: I mean, that is our life’s work. It is 
a for-real thing. We are going to build a 
pyramid. We’re still collecting Jerrys. Still 
collecting bricks for it. The last “The Great 
Satan” tour that we did, we received 
everything is terrible!everything is terrible!

— AN INTERVIEW WITH —
4

---------------------------------------------------

almost 7,000 Jerrys. In this two weeks, 
we’re expecting to get at least 2,000. 
You know, there’s a lot of legwork we’re 
expecting everyone to do, to go out there 
and get them and bring them to us. That 
is just an ongoing project that we demand 
that our followers provide us with building 
materials. As far as like the boring bones 
of the project, we’re still looking for 
land in Arizona to find the right site to 
purchase and then to move forward with 
the construction. We’re really keeping it 
very open and being like this pyramid will 
rise in the next decade.
BL: It’s funny that there’s a part of this 
project that you consider to be “boring 
bones” considering that it’s this Jerry 
Maguire pyramid. What’s that interaction 
like? Whenever you call and you’re 
talking about purchasing land do you 
have to explain what it is?
CG: Yeah, absolutely. And it is a big 
roadblock and that’s why it’s taking us 
a long time to find the right site. I mean 
you can assume any time somebody 
builds like another god-forsaken CVS or 
whatever else on any corner, it takes a lot 
of crap to do that and to do a three-story 
pyramid covered in Jerry Maguires in the 
middle of nowhere is even harder. There 
is a lot of pretty dumb red tape we need 
to sort through. We want it to live forever. 
We hope that we’re all rotting in the 
ground for generations while the pyramid 
is still growing.
BL: Something that I was introduced to 
your group through—and correct me if I’m 
wrong, but I believe this is sort of your first 
thing—are doing these short clips from 
old, wild VHS tapes and other sources and 
posting them on Youtube. These produced 
some really good viral content like Duane 
and the Milwaukee cops vs knives. My 
first question is if there’s an underrated 
favorite that you have, one that might’ve 
not gone viral but you find yourself kind 
of in love with.
CG: Yeah, it’s so interesting. We’ve done 
that part of the project for almost 11 years 
now and that’s obviously the roots of the 
whole thing and where we’ve gotten all 
of our inspiration and groundwork for 
the entire universe that we’ve built. It’s 
really weird to have posted a video onto 
the internet every single day for that long. 
Just to try to organize it in your brain and 
make sense of it is overwhelming. I have 
favorites like every month that will not do 
well at all and I’ll just be so confused, and 
then there’s ones I won’t think are going 
to do well at all and they’ll just blow up. 
The internet is a weird, fickle place like 
the real world, and nothing makes sense 
and everything is just truly terrible at the 
same moment. But yeah, there’s so many 
ones that I love, like going way, way back 
to some of the hits I have made that I love 
is like there’s a public dyeing video that 
teaches you about a place that dyes pubic 
hair in various ways. It’s like really insane. 
I’m a big fan of all the kids’ stuff. I always 
find that stuff particularly insane. Just 
anytime someone thinks they’ve made 
something for a child and they’re just 
failing epically and in every way.
BL: Gerbert is a particular favorite of 
mine.
CG: Yeah, Gerbert is a huge part of our 
world. I mean, we’ve actually build our 
own Gerbert puppet that we use for live 
shows and stuff. Someone actually asked 
us one time after a show how we got 
Gerbert. We’re like “You know we just 
built that right? Gerbert’s not real. He’s 
not a real boy.”
BL: With that being the origin, what 
inspired you to start posting these weird 
VHS tapes? Were you finding them and 
decided this is content we need to show 
people or did you just sort of happen 
upon it?
CG: It was a lot more personal. We were 
fans of a lot of found footage work and a 
lot of video collage stuff and had been in 
that world for a little while as just viewers 
and had also just been kids who grew up 
with VHS tapes. I mean I had two VCRs 
and a converter when I was really young 
and I was copying every single tape I 
rented from the video store. I would copy 
pornographic films and sell them to the 
younger kids. I’ve been up to the same 
thing since forever so it only made sense 
to end up here. We’re also the perfect 
age where torrenting and all of that kind 
of happened right when we were in like 
late high school and college so we just 
kind of came into the adulthood of media 
thinking that we could gather everything 
and use it however we wanted which is 
a more extreme interpretation of fair-use 
than I think a lot of people have. I think 
that being our condition combined with 
being the right age to start on Blogger 
and Youtube when those things blew 
up, or as like the more wild-west of the 
internet blew up, it just kind of gave us 
a real upper-hand in reaching people 
10 years ago. As far as the project goes, 
it was personal. We wanted to make a 
feature edit. We lived across country from 
each other we were just sending each 
other clips on Youtube and people started 
catching on.
BL: So you guys currently have a lot of 
projects going on. You have still videos 
going up on Youtube. That’s daily correct? 
CG: Yeah, that is daily. It’s Monday 
through Friday.
BL: Making thousands of videos. You 
have the tour up and coming again. You 
have Jerry Maguire always. Are there any 
new projects coming out that you guys 
are working on or any new areas you’re 
looking to explore?
CG: Absolutely! Memory Hole, which 
I’m not sure you’re familiar with, it’s all 
home video based human horror. We’re 
working on a new feature with that and 
collaborating with some pretty awesome 
people. So, I think that’s going to be 
pretty terrifying and great. We’re doing 
a handful of physical installations the 
next coming while. We’ve been working 
with Meow Wolf in Santa Fe quite a 
bit. They’re opening a new permanent 
installation in Denver we’re going to have 
a room in. It’s going to be pretty insane. 
And other stuff too that I can’t talk about.
BL: Sounds great. I’m looking forward to 
it!
CG: Yeah. Busy, busy, busy.
BL: Any final comments?
CG: Yeah, be sure to tell everybody to 
bring out their Jerrys to the shows.

“He would never give up trying. He would take an impossible situation 
and make everything possible,” wrote Kevin Kwan in his bestselling novel, 
Crazy Rich Asians. To many, it may have seemed impossible for Crazy 
Rich Asians to be adapted to ilm at all, much less become a blockbuster 
this summer. But director Jon M. Chu and author 
Kevin Kwan were determined to have this 
ilm in theaters, no matter the cost, even 
turning down a huge offer from Netlix 
to guarantee that the ilm got the 
audience it deserved. And it paid 
off, with several consecutive weeks 
at #1.
Crazy Rich Asians tells the story 
of Rachel Chu (Constance Wu), an 
Asian-American economics professor 
who is invited by her boyfriend, Nick 
Young (Henry Golding), to his friend’s 
wedding in Singapore. Unbeknownst 
to Rachel, Nick is somewhat of a celebrity 
in Singapore and across the Asian continent 
due to his family’s wealth and illustrious 
company. So when Rachel goes to Singapore 
with Nick, she has no clue what she is about 
to be thrown into when she arrives.
When I irst entered the theater, I honestly 
had no idea what I was about to experience. I 
knew it was going to be good, but the min-
ute the theater went dark, I was immediately 
hooked. The movie opens with child Nick and the 
rest of the Young family trying to check into their 
hotel after a long day of travel and getting caught 
in the rain. However, their hotel staff is extremely rude 
and disrespectful to the family, even kicking them out 
and not allowing Nick’s mother, Eleanor (Michelle Yeoh), 
to use their telephone. Very quickly, however, Eleanor pulls 
some strings and completely turns the hotel upside down when her  
husband completely buys out the hotel. That moment, while not a major 
plot point, was a powerful start to the movie. To see Eleanor exert her  
inluence—instead of being submissive like many people may expect 
Asians to be—was really incredible to see.
Almost instantly, I found myself tearing up. Between Eleanor’s show of 
strength and oddly enough, simply being introduced to Nick’s quirky 
family, I felt so empowered and inspired. Even in this brief montage of 
footage about each of the characters, there was already so much more 
nuance to them than I had ever seen in any other movies. Whereas ilms 
in the past have rarely bothered to lesh out the Asian side characters, all 
the characters in Crazy Rich Asians, no matter how large or small their 
role, felt palpable.
As the story progressed and I got to see Rachel struggle to deal with the 
hardships of disapproval, alienation, and scrutiny, I could feel even more 
of a connection with her and the rest of the characters. Rachel’s story 
gave me that raw and authentic feeling of not being good enough or 
Asian enough to satisfy everyone who was watching her. While I may not 
have ever had to experience crazy ex-girlfriends and their minions leaving 
dead ish in my bed, that feeling of being shut out, to some capacity, is 
deinitely one that people can universally relate to.
Despite all this pain and criticism she faces, Rachel remains 
strong. She is one of the bravest and most selless charac-
ters I have ever seen on screen. She keeps her head up 
high and stands up for herself through it all, and inds 
even the tiniest of victories in the worst situations. 
Most importantly, she stays true to herself and 
her heart, even when faced with tough decisions. 
Watching her journey was an emotional experi-
ence, and I’m surprised I managed to survive the 
experience without a box of tissues by my side (I 
deinitely could have used it).
Although there were some very sad moments in 
the ilm, the movie was still a romantic comedy 
at heart. Interwoven through it all was fantastic 
comic relief from Rachel’s best friend Peik Lin 
(Awkwaina) and her family, as well as 
some of Nick’s weird relatives. I found 
myself laughing hysterically at the crazy 
antics of these characters, and swoon-
ing over Rachel and Nick’s romance. 
Their relationship deinitely had its ups 
and downs like any other, but it was so 
clear even during the worst of it all how 
much they cared for and loved each other.
I very rarely cry in happiness but I was 
almost sobbing from the pure, unadulterated 
emotions this movie invoked. It was the Cinder-
ella story I didn’t realize how desperately I needed. Needless 
to say, I was a puddle of emotions by the end of the ilm. Never 
have I ever fallen so passionately in love with a movie.
At this point, everyone’s probably heard about how groundbreaking it is 
to have a movie with an all-Asian cast hit the big screen. I just hope that 
this trend continues, and that we not only see more movies with Asian 
casts, but that we have realistic representations of all minorities in all 
movies. It’s hard to truly understand that feeling until you still ind yourself 
crying hours after the movie ended because you inally feel represented. 
That was me after seeing Crazy Rich Asians, and I hope that everyone can 
feel that way too someday.

CRAZY           ASIANSRICH

---------------------------------------------------

Based on the YA novel of the same name, To All The Boys I’ve Loved  
Before follows Lara Jean (Lana Condor), in her junior year of high school. 
When Lara Jean has a crush so intense that she doesn’t know what to do, 
she writes a letter; but, when her letters mysteriously get out, all her crushes 
ind out how she felt about them - all at once. One of her past crushes, Peter, 
suggests that they pretend to date to make his ex jealous and to help cover up 
Lara Jean’s longtime crush for her older sister’s boyfriend, and she accepts.  
As they spend more and more time together, Lara Jean gets more confused 
about her feelings and realizes that she has real feelings for Peter. The 
story follows Lara Jean as she tries to set all her relationships straight 
while navigating the teetering balance between her real feelings and 
her fake relationship.
To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is a play on the popular “fake dating” trope, 
and while there are cliché elements to the movie, it’s an overall incredibly 
charming story. The movie adhered to many typical romcom conventions, my 
favorite of which was the freeze-frame character introduction. An easy, simple 
written by Natalie Schmidt | Staffwriter
art by Rebecca Enright | Staff Artist
way to introduce new characters, the freeze-frame allowed the audience to 
get insight on the characters surrounding Lara Jean from Lara Jean herself. 
Albeit a common convention and maybe a little cliché, it surprisingly 
worked well in this context. And, while we may not all write letters 
to our crushes, we can relate to Lara Jean’s embarrassments and 
heartbreaks, which prevent the movie from getting too campy or 
cheesy. In all, this movie knows what it is – it isn’t striving to be the most  
innovative romcom or the most inventive; it’s simply trying to tell a heart-
warming story with fun characters.
One of the biggest positives of the movie was its diversity. Author Jenny Han, 
who is Korean American, had expressed the necessity that her main charac-
ter be Asian American. With so many romcoms being released every year, 
few actually showcase a diverse leading actor or cast, but that is something 
that this movie does incredibly well. Condor herself is Vietnamese and  
visibly Asian; many Asian Americans, myself included, can often be white-
passing, so it’s refreshing to see someone undeniably Asian in a leading 
role. The best part, though, is that Lara Jean isn’t reduced to any of the 
typical Hollywood stereotypes – there are no neon streaks of hair, overly 
quirky traits, or katanas in sight. She is simply a high school girl who 
happens to be Asian, which is so relieving. It’s strange to be grateful for 
seeing a culture be portrayed normally and without exaggeration, but it is 
an unfortunate side of Hollywood that has gotten all too common.
However, in an opinion for The New York Times, Han said, “I ended up 
deciding to work with the only production company that agreed the main 
character would be played by an Asian actress. No one else was willing 
to do it. Still, I was holding my breath all the way up until shooting began 
because I was scared they would change their minds. They didn’t.” Even 
in a day and age where production companies can be found by the thou-
sands, it’s unsurprising that only one wanted to highlight the original book’s 
diversity. Adaptations don’t necessarily need to be an exact carbon copy 
of their source material, but certain aspects – like, for example, a main 
character who’s a person of color or female – should be respected, espe-
cially in the case of female Asian American representation - which is few and 
far between. As an Asian American girl who grew up in California, this is 
an issue I’m all too familiar with. Every single romcom I saw starred 
a handsome, classic-Hollywood-looking white man and an equally 
beautiful white woman. I had never seen people who looked like 
me in these fantastically romantic movies, and it had a huge  
negative effect on me – seeing only other people fall in love and be happy 
in relationships had created a warped concept of who was allowed to have 
these cheesy, heartwarming stories and who wasn’t. I wouldn’t call To All 
the Boys I’ve Loved Before revolutionary, but it’s an important movie show-
casing the necessity of diverse characters.
To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is the romcom I wish I had grow-
ing up and is a sweet portrayal of what it means to be young, 
innocent, and in love. Representation is a powerful thing, 
because when you see someone who looks like you, 
you can imagine being in their shoes. Hopefully, for 
young Asian American girls, they can look at Lara 
Jean and realize they too can be not only actresses, 
but also leading women on screen and off.107

Fall Out Boy bringsM A  N   I    A
to Pittsburgh
8
I had bought my tickets for Wednesday’s Fall Out Boy concert in PPG 
Paints Arena on Jan. 22 at around 10:15 a.m. My best friend and I sat at 
a table in Au Bon Pain with both of our laptops open to Ticketmaster so we 
could buy the best tickets possible. For context, tickets for this show had 
gone on sale on Jan. 22 at 10 a.m.
The Chicago, IL-based emo pop punk band had made a huge impact on 
both of our lives. It’s a band that’s always been there at small, seemingly 
insignificant points in my life before building up to become a band that has 
helped me to define myself and my own identity during my junior year of 
high school. It’s a band whose lyrics spoke to some of the deepest parts 
of myself and whose music provided me happiness and guidance when I’d 
needed it the most.
On their MANIA Tour, Fall Out Boy brought two openers with them: 
metalcore band Every Time I Die and Machine Gun Kelly. I had known 
Every Time I Die from the time I tried listening to more punk pop punk 
music, but I had not expected the level of energy they had brought to 
the stage. Their music was a bit jarring compared to what I was used to, 
but they still made for a fun set and at times their songs were surprisingly 
heartfelt. The biggest problem, however, was after the set. My friend and I 
had floor seats, right next to a runway portion of the stage and right next 
to speakers. Our ears felt blown out, and I was doubting if I would be able 
to even hear Fall Out Boy perform after Machine Gun Kelly.
Hot off the heels of a feud with Eminem, Machine Gun Kelly did not disap-
point at all. The Cleveland, OH-based rapper’s set brought the energy up 
to new heights after Every Time I Die’s performance, performing crowd-
pleasers and hits like “Bad Things” and “Rehab.” Machine Gun Kelly 
threw in a diss at Eminem and walked into the crowd interacting with fans 
who were holding up “Rap Devil” signs, while performing the diss track of 
the same name. Putting that fight aside, Machine Gun Kelly was a surpris-
ingly great fit to the tour, and charmed the crowd with his fire, energy, 
and unwavering confidence and fearlessness.
This was my third Fall Out Boy concert, but from Fall Out Boy’s opener 
“Disloyal Order of the Water Buffaloes” I remained hooked, pumped, and 
possibly more excited than I’d been the last two times I had seen them. 

---------------------------------------------------

After seventeen years of performing, the band knows their hits and what really gets the crowd going: nearly 
everyone in the crowd screamed out the first lyrics to “Sugar, We’re Going Down,” clapped along to “Uma 
Thurman,” and swayed along to one of the band’s only ballads “Save Rock & Roll.” However, they weren’t 
afraid to play newer songs as well from their latest album MANIA such as “Stay Frosty Royal Milk Tea,” a 
stripped-down version of “Young & Menace,” a song that flirts with dubstep; and “Lake Effect Kid,” a song 
they wrote in 2008 and then re-released in a special EP late August.
A lot of the elements of the concert still felt the same. “I Don’t Care” was still the action-packed, unabashed, 
refreshing banger that kicks off the band’s third phase of songs, complete with middle fingers all over the 
screen behind them. While no one stood for the band’s national anthem, or “Grand Theft Autumn/Where 
is Your Boy,” fans who knew the song stood in spirit and sung along to the song’s opening lyrics. Drummer 
Andy Hurley exercised his superior talent in a drum solo over songs like Kendrick Lamar’s “HUMBLE.” And of 
course, the band closed off with “Saturday,” one of the band’s first hits that still encapsulates the band’s spirit 
17 years later.
Throughout the band’s seven albums, their sound has changed drastically. And it’s pushed some people 
away, but for a lot of people, Fall Out Boy dominates a realm of nostalgia that’s absolutely infectious and 
keeps fans, both new and old, coming back for more. When my friend and I arrived and got off the 67 bus, 
we immediately saw two of our friends from orientation who also had floor seats. I had seen a girl who had 
lived in my freshman dorm with her boyfriend ten minutes later. During the entire night, I’d seen at least ten 
Snapchat or Instagram stories of Fall Out Boy performing at the concert and gotten a few texts 
from friends I hadn’t talked to in months trying to find out where I was in PPG Paints Arena. 
My friend and I ended up taking the bus ride home with a girl who lived two doors 
down from me my freshman year, and the little sister of one of my first friends at 
Carnegie Mellon.
And because of that nostalgia, Fall Out Boy brings people together 
across time and space. Yes, often they get called “Sellout Boy” 
more times than not. But that nostalgia kicks up some youthful, 
rebellious joy and energy that unleashes itself anywhere. And that joy 
and energy was in full force tonight. No matter what, at its core Fall 
Out Boy remains a band that refuses to be put in a box and con-
