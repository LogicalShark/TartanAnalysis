THE APPLIED DESIGN MAS­
QUERADE.
The masquerade held in the Con­
servatory of Music on Dithridge 
street Thursday evening, November
2, was participated in by many stu­
dents of the School of Applied De­
sign and their invited friends. Some 
fifty couples were in attendance.
The unmasking took place after the 
eighth dance, and during the remain­
der of the evening programs were 
used. The costumes were varied and 
amusing, and the general interest dis­
played in securing them went far 
toward making the affair successful. 
The rule that all should attend 
masked was well adhered to. The 
confetti used was reminiscent of Hal­
lowe’en, and helped to increase the 
general gayety.
Among the members of the Fac­
ulty and their wives in attendance 
were Prof. and Mrs. Zeller, Prof. and 
Mrs. Ferrand and Professors Hewlett, 
Geoghegan and Sparks. The success 
of the evening was due to the excel­
lent music, the careful management 
of the affair, and the interest in the 
costuming displayed.
The dancing was indulged in until 
two o’clock, and was interspersed 
with numerous moonlight dances. 
Light refreshments were served. It 
was altogether a most agreeable af­
fair, at the end of which a general 
enthusiasm displaced the usual glad- 
to-go-home-I’m-tired feeling.
CIVIL MEETING.
Last Saturday evening saw the No­
vember meeting of the C. Eng. So­
ciety. The attendance was good, and 
the meeting proved exceedingly pro­
fitable and pleasant.
Following the transaction of busi­
ness, Prof. Horace R. Thayer lectured 
upon the failure of the Austin dam.
Prof. Thayer first treated the sub­
ject in a popular way, telling of the 
difficulties encountered in railway 
service from Pittsburgh to Austin; of 
the opinions of the nature of the coun­
try side regarding the disaster; and 
of the havoc wrought by the pulp- 
wood borne upon the flood waters. 
He followed this -with a discussion of 
the failure of the dam from a scien­
tific standpoint, a full account of 
which will appear in next week’s Tar­
tan, together with several views from 
the scene of the disaster.
After the lecture the meetinjg ad­
journed to the commons, where with 
music, lunch and smoke, a pleasant 
hour was spent. The meeting then 
adjourned to meet the first Saturday 
in December.
TUESDAY, THE 31st OF OCT.
Despite the rain, Tuesday of last 
week was a brilliant day for Pitts­
burgh;
The christening of the replica of 
the “Fulton” by Mrs. Alice Roose- 
velt-Longworth marked the centen­
nial of steamboat navigation upon our 
rivers. The most interesting event 
of the day, for students of science, 
and coming engineers, was the Na­
tional Mine Safety demonstration at 
Forbes Field.
One part of the demonstration 
showed the cause and prevention of 
mine explosions; the other showed 
the first aid to the injured after the 
explosion. The first aid work was re­
markable for its rapidity and effici­
ency.
For the demonstration of the 
causes and prevention of explosion in 
mines, a cylindrical tube of rivet steel 
plates, 133 feet long and 6 feet 4 
inches in diameter was used as a gal­
lery of a mine. 133 pounds of coal 
dust from the Pittsburgh seam was 
distributed uniformly throughout the 
tube; 20 pounds of this dust was 
placed upon a bench 20 feet long and 
directly in front of the cannon, at one 
end of the tube. An explosive, .per­
missible under these conditions was 
first exploded within the cannon. No 
explosion of the coal dust followed. 
Again, FFF black powder was used 
in the cannon. As a result the 133 
pounds of coal exploded as though it 
were so much gun powder, belching 
fire from manholes in the roof and 
from the entrance of the cylinder. 
Each explosive had a disruptive force 
equal to one-half pound of 40 per 
cent, nitroglycerine tamped with one 
pound of fire clay. The' experiment 
showed that to the explosive used 
within a mine is often due the acci­
dent so costly in human life.
After the demonstration, speeches 
were made by Miss Mabel Boardman, 
of the American National Red Cross 
Society; Walter L. Fisher, Secretary 
of the Interior; John K. Tener, Gov­
ernor of Pennsylvania, and William 
H. Taft, President of the United 
States.
In conclusion, trophies were pre­
sented to each of the participants in 
the day’s proceedings.
----------------o----------------
Secretary Field is in receipt of a 
letter from Haakon Styri, Electrical, 
’10, from Hachen, Germany, where 
he went recently in order to enter 
the Technische Hochschule, to com­
plete his study of electro-chemistry 
and electro-metallurgy. He finds 
himself considerably handicapped be­
cause he did not obtain a degree upon 
graduating from Carnegie, and states 
that if C. T. S. granted degrees, the 
schools would become better known 
abroad.
ALLEGHENY WINS ON HOME 
GROUNDS.
Carnegie Tech’s second defeat of 
the season was chalked up against 
them last Saturday at Meadville, when 
they met the Allegheny College 
eleven. As in the previous game lost, 
the opponents outweighed our men 
greatly, but it cannot be said they 
outplayed the Tartan defenders. The 
continued improvement in the play­
ing of our boys should be a source of 
great satisfaction to the followers, 
for the whole team played better than 
in any previous game. With the ex­
ception of the first few minutes of 
play, the tackling and handling of the 
ball was sure and reliable, and the 
return of punts was the means of 
greatest gains.
In the first half, the heavy Alle­
gheny back field, broke through our 
line, or skirted our ends, for alarm­
ing gains, but the Plaid boys took a 
decided brace after the intermission 
and broke up all of the plays that 
the Gold and Blue relied most upon. 
In the two last periods both teams re­
sorted to kicking frequently, keeping 
the pigskin in constant motion. While 
Schmucker was not punting his best, 
he succeeded in beating the distances 
of Hawk’s attempts.. Besides doing 
all of the kicking, Schmucker starred 
in carrying the ball. Balsinger also 
was a stellar performer. He once 
gained twenty-five yards on a delayed 
pass, and again negotiated the same 
distance on a forward pass. Patter­
son was handicapped by his lack of 
weight in carrying the ball, but 
proved extremely useful in the inter­
ference and on secondary defense. 
Lucas put up an excellent game at 
quarter-back during the time he 
played that position. Hall, who re­
placed Lucas, handled the team like 
a veteran. All of the line played to 
the best of their ability, which is 
some good. Taylor, Crawford and 
McCully were the ones easiest to pick 
out for brilliant playing; each of them 
featured at various periods.
While we dislike to mention mis­
takes on the part of officials, we must 
say that some of those made by Smith, 
of Indiana University, were nothing 
short of rank, especially as one of 
them robbed us of a good chance to 
win the game. In the last five min­
utes of play, Lavely started a forward 
pass that never reached its destina­
tion. Schmucker, waiting on his own 
45-yard line, got himself in the way, 
grabbed the ball and started down the 
field. McCully and Balsinger took 
off a couple of would-be tacklers, and 
the light-haired hero dodged the oth­
ers until he had traveled 60 yards, 
when he was downed four yards from 
the goal. Then was the time seized 
by the umpire to charge that 
Schmucker had stepped out of bounds
at the middle of the field. Although 
Capt. Taylor proved to the best of 
his ability that it was McCully who 
had been the offender, and our lines­
man and the spectators near that 
point corroborated him, the umpire 
overruled him, and the ball was put 
into play in the middle of the field. 
Thus was lost a sure touchdown.
The game was started at 3:15 by 
Schmucker kicking off to Allegheny’s 
20-yard line, Abbott catching and re­
turning the ball 10 yards. Miller and 
Lavely each gained 5 yards, then 
Miller took the ball for a run around 
right end for 35 yards, being stopped 
by Balsinger. On the next attempt 
he failed to gain an inch. Lavely 
made 8 yards through the line. Mc­
Cully showed that he had his eyes 
on the ball by recovering a fumble. 
Schmucker punted out of bounds on 
the 55 mark. Miller started on an­
other long rurt, but let the ball get 
away from him, and McCully recov­
ered the ball on our 25-yard line. 
Schmucker gained 3 yards, but Pat­
terson was' downed for a loss of 7 
units. Schmucker punted to Alle­
gheny’s 50 mark and Kesselman was 
the first man to the ball. The cold 
had affected our men and the next 
pass was fumbled, Taylor recovering 
the leather on our 50-yard mark. 
Schmucker lost his feet and sat down 
hard in the mud puddle in the center 
of the field, just as thè ball touched 
his, hands, and Bodenhorn had pos­
session. Abbott, Lavely and Miller 
advanced the ovoid to 3 yards from 
the goal by hitting the line. Alle­
gheny was penalized 15 yards for hold­
ing. Lavely gained a scant yard, and 
Hawk attempted to drop-kick a goal, 
failing ignominiously. Schmucker 
kicked to the 40 mark on his own 
side of the field, but Hawk returned 
20 units. W. Dotterer gained 10 yards 
through the line, and Lavely was sent 
around right end for 10 yards and a 
touchdown. Hawk failed to kick goal.
Schmucker kicked off to Lavely on 
Allegheny’s 15-yard mark, and the lat­
ter player returned only 3 yards. 
Hawk kicked to Patterson on Car­
negie’s 50-yard mark. The mud 
caused another fumble, and Allegheny 
got the ball. Hawk kicked, and Bal­
singer gained 5 yards to the 30 mark, 
as the quarter ended. Score—Alle­
gheny, 5; Carnegie, 0.
Lucas gained 7 yards in two downs, 
and Schmucker kicked to Townsend, 
who was downed on his 30 line. Hawk 
and Schmucker exchanged punts 
thrice in quick succession; Balsinger 
received the ball on our 50 mark, and 
returned it 10 yards before losing on 
a fumble. Ayres was sent in for Wea­
ver, who had sprained his ankle. Then 
followed a series of line plunges by 
Allegheny’s backs for small gains, end­
ing with ball on our 30-yard line.

CROSS COUNTRY RUN.
Track men were much interested by 
the notices last week of practice for 
the Cross Country Run. Captain 
Boots, of this year’s track team, is 
enthusiastic about the prospects for 
- an exciting race,. as quite a number 
of distance men were discovered at 
the track meet held recently. Beeken, 
Knapp, Stubnitz, Simpson, Grupp, 
Kaul, Buck, Griswold and a number 
of others, have shown a wonderful 
¦ amount of ability in this line, and 
must all be counted near the front.
Practice is being held daily thru 
Schenley Park and the surrounding 
1 territory, so that all the men will be 
in shape on November 25th, the day 
I of the race, to cover the three miles 
I in record time.
ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST
On five afternoons of the week the 
foot-ball team holds a practice session 
on the field. On five afternoons of 
the week the bleachers are nearly 
empty. There is probably no 
other college in the country support­
ing a college team where the student- 
body at large shows so little interest in 
that team other than the day of the 
game as does the student-body at 
Carnegie. The mere calling attention 
to these three facts should cause the 
bleachers to contain a representative 
body of students on the afternoons 
of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 
Thursday, and Friday, as well as on 
Saturday.
After a week’s loaf the Architects 
did a day’s work on Saturday.
We have explosions every day in 
cur back yard that beat the now fam­
ous mine explosions at Forbes Field 
all to pieces for noise.

It is to be hoped that that parrot 
has enlarged his capacity for talking 
during his sojourn among the co-eds. 
There is a great deal in a good ex­
ample.
The British Embassador, unknow­
ingly, proved the cause of a disap­
pointment to the M. M. C. S. stu­
dents by failing to visit the various 
rooms, as it was supposed he would.
The total registration up to noon 
on Saturday was 230 in excess of any 
previous registration, a good gain, 
especially when it is remembered 
that the registration is not complete 
as yet.
—o—
Last Monday Mrs. Lucia Ames- 
mead addressed the students of M. 
M. C. S. on the subject of Interna­
tional Peace. The address proved 
very interesting as well as instructive, 
the following being some of the 
points made against war.
That since all the nations are vit­
ally concerned in each other’s well- 
fare, war not only means disaster for 
the countries fighting, but means 
£-reat loss to the neutral nations. 
That Franklin’s dictum, “The worst 
you can do with a customer is to 
knock him on the head, and the next 
worse thing is to leave him a pau­
per” is as true today as when first 
spoken.
—o—
At the office of the Secretary last 
week was received a letter from Miss 
Kittie McMullen, a graduate of the 
M. M. C. S. Miss. McMullen is in 
China studying the language in order 
to fit herself for educational work 
there. Her address is Tunghiang, 
Chekiang Province. It is especially 
interesting to have received this letter 
at this time in view of the revolution 
now going on.
—ó—
Last week at W. & J. two foot-ball 
players were declared ineligible be­
cause they had not been in residence 
at the college the required number of 
weeks. This action upon the part of 
W. & J. is to be commended, it means 
much for clean foot-ball and, we 
think, for W. & J.

4TH E TARTAN
(Continued from Page 1) 
Hawk’s attempt at a field goal was 
blocked by Schmucker, who returned 
10 yards to our 15 mark against much 
opposition. Schmucker punted into 
Allegheny territory, and Townsend, 
carrying the ball, went out of bounds 
5 yards on our side of the field. The 
ball was given to Carnegie as a pen­
alty for Allegheny. Patterson was 
again thrown for a loss, and Schmuck­
er kicked. Hawk punted in return to 
our 50 mark and Balsinger carried it 
back 10 yards. Lucas and Schmuckei 
each gained 1 yard before the half 
ended.
Schmucker kicked off and Hawk 
punted in return, leaving the ball in 
the middle of the field. Hall, Alle­
gheny’s guard, tackled PattQrson for 
a loss of 2 yards, but was disabled in 
so doing, Baker was substituted. 
Schmucker kicked to Allegheny’s 5- 
yard line. Hawk’s kick was blocked 
and recovered out of bounds on the 
15 mark by Schmucker. Patterson 
gained 3 yards. A forward pass was 
incomplete, but Allegheny was penal­
ized for off-side play and Carnegie 
given first down. Schmucker and 
Lucas failed to gain more than 3 
yards, and Schmucker attempted a 
field goal. It failed only by a few 
inches. Hall was sent in for Lucas 
and a punting duel between Hawk 
and Schmucker followed. Five suc­
cessive kicks were registered, termi­
nating 53 yards from Allegheny’s 
goal. Balsinger then carried the, ball 
for 25 yards on a delayed pass. An 
attempted forward pass was fumbled, 
and Wieler recovered the pigskin on 
his own 35-yard line. Miller gained 
4 yards and Lavely 3, then Hawk 
kicked. Schmucker replied in kind, 
but Hawk again punted. Balsinger re­
turned the ball 10 yards to the cen­
ter line, but lost possession. Mc- 
Cully broke through and tackled 
Townsend for no gain, forcing Hawk 
to kick. The quarter ended with the 
leather encased bladder in Carnegie’s 
possession on our 36-yard line.
Hall failed to gain, and Schmucker 
punted to the middle of the field, 
Townsend recovering. W. Dotterer 
could not gain, but a forward pass, 
Lavely to Hawk, netted 25 yards. Ab­
bott and Miller carried the ball to 
our 20 mark, where we regained pos­
session on downs. Schmucker punted 
20 yards, but Hawk returned the ball 
15. A forward pass failed, and Hawk 
tried to drop-kick a field goal, but the 
ball went wide.
Schmucker kicked out of bounds on 
the center line. Abbott made 10 yards 
and W. Dotterer 4. At this point 
Lavely started the forward pass that 
Schmucker carried so far, only to be 
called back. Balsinger gained 1 yard, 
and W. Dotterer intercepted a for­
ward pass. Hawk and Schmucker ex­
changed two punts each. Crawford 
tackled Hawk in a pretty manner for 
no gain. Hawk kicked to Balsinger 
on Allegheny’s 50 mark, and the Skibo 
lad came back 20 yards. The whistle 
stopped the game. Score—Allegheny, 
5; Carnegie, 0.

SCRUBS WIN FROM DUQUESNE 
UNIVERSITY.
Carnegie Tech Scrubs continued 
their string of victories to-day in de­
feating the fast Duquesne University 
team 11 to 6. As in previous games, 
the Scrubs’ line was almost impreg­
nable and Mamaux, the strt kicker of 
Duquesne, was given aa number of 
opportunities to assert his ability in 
kicking the ball out of a dangerous 
territory. The longest gain of the 
game, thirty yards, was made on a 
forward pass to Buck. Engstrom, 
Phelan, Schneider and Buck started 
for theScrubs while Bunk Callahan, 
Heinrich and Madden were prominent 
for Duquesne. Tech Scrubs still have 
the first game to lose. The game 
was played on the University campus, j
