LIST OF POINTS 
FOR ACTIVITIES
Point System Now Effective 
Under Following 
Plan
The new gym will be ready for use early in September. President Baker 
made the announcement near the close of the Carnegie Day exercises at the 
Music Hall last Friday morning.
At a meeting of the alumni gym committee held the previous Friday, 
Professor Hornbostel presented sketches of the new plans, which were ten­
tatively accepted. Later the Gym Building Committee of Trustees tentative- 
• ly accepted them. A general meeting of the committee will be called this 
week to definitely approve the present plans.
Last year the Carnegie Corporation of New York appropriated four hun­
dred thousand dollars for a gymnasium building which was to have been 
erected on the corner of Woodlawn avenue and Tech street, adjoining the 
College of Fine Arts. For several1- 
reasons it was deemed best to secure 
a more favorable location. With this 
idea in mind, negotiations were put 
under way for the purchase of the 
Steele property opposite the Marga­
ret Morrison Building. Recently a 
transfer of the property was made, 
and work started on a set of new 
plans which call for the breaking of 
ground in January for four separate 
buildings; a gymnasium, a swimming 
pool, a girls’ gymnasium, and a men’s 
locker room. The trustees broke a 
precedent when they purchased this 
property out of funds that were avail­
able. Tbi3 action leaves the four 
hundred thousand dollar appropria­
tion intact.
The new site offers possibilities for 
a tunnel to connect the locker rooms 
with a stadium which we hope to have 
in the near future on the present lo­
cation of our field.
The new building will incorporate 
many features not customarily found 
in structures of this type and it is 
expected to be superior to any gym­
nasium now existing in this country.
As far as possible, all rooms will be 
on the main floor.
A three story building, facing 
Woodlawn avenue, will contain offi­
ces, men’s and women’s trophy
rooms and showers, on the ground 
floor; offices on the second floor; and 
two small gyms for special purposes, 
besides handball courts on the third 
floor.

Twenty Five Songs 
Ready For Song Book
Committee Deserves Credit 
For Untiring Efforts.
What do you think of the new set­
ting for the Alma Mater? Sounded 
pretty good at the Carnegie Day ex­
ercises, didn't it? Who do you think 
was responsible for the bringing forth 
of the new music? It was the much- 
heard of Song Book Committee, the 
committee appointed last year to pre­
pare a song book of distinctive Car­
negie Tech songs.
The student body has blamed the 
delay in publishing this book on the 
committee, believing that it was lay­
ing down on the job. How hard the 
committee has been working few can 
understand, as only one familiar with 
the tedious job of preparing a Song 
Book knows what a terrific amount of 
preparation it requires. It has not 
been the fault of the committee that 
the book has been delayed—if any 
are to be blamed it is the student 
body. Requests for contributions of 
songs' ditties, etc., have -been abso­
lutely useless as not a response has 
been made.
Despite the poor support, the com­
mittee has prepared about twenty-five 
songs for the book; all of the old fa­
miliar Campus Songs and many new 
ones. The new Alma Mater by J. 
Vick O’Brien, is one of the new songs 
that will appear in the book. “Hail 
Carnegie” by Koppes and Frey of the 
Arts College is another that is un­
doubtedly going to be popular. “Hail 
to Carnegie” is the name of the new 
song written by Leonore Davis. 
Hosdevitch has arranged one of the 
old popular songs and renamed it 
"Carnegie Tech.” Mathew Frey has 
written the song “Always Mine,” from 
the famous love waltz of the same

Radio Fans Entertained
By Glee Club Members
A double quartet from the Glee 
Club sang over the radio from the 
Leader Studio last Friday night. 
Rockne and Steffen gave talks on 
football in conjunction with the con­
cert.
F. Harris, Brackett, Murphy, Sload, 
Cutting, Gumbert, E. Harris and 
Loughrey were the members of the 
group. They sang six numbers. 
Brackett and Murphy sang a few so­
los. This double quartet also sang 
at a Knights of Columbus meeting 
last Sunday afternoon at the Harris 
Theater.
In view of the fact that the Point 
System has gone into effect this year, 
the following list of points in the va­
rious activities, which was published 
in last year’s Carnegie Tartan, is here 
reproduced. Everyone should pre­
serve a copy of this list so that he 
may know where he stands in relation 
to the new system.
For the benefit of the new stu­
dents: No student is allowed to car­
ry more than twenty points in one 
school year. The system will be of 
great benefit to the individual stu­
dents as well as to the activities 
which will thus get the support of all 
the students instead of that of a small 
group.
Attention is called to section four 
of the Resolution on the Point Sys­
tem as adopted by the Student Coun­
cil last January:
4. Each organization secretary (nr 
manager, if no secretary is elected) 
shall furnish the Point Committee 
with the names of students in their 
organization receiving points under 
these regulations.
Following is the list of points for 
the various activities with the 
changes that have been made sinco 
last January:

Carnegie Women to
Join Voter’s League
A mass meeting of the women stu­
dents was called for Wednesday aft­
ernoon in the Margaret Morrison as­
sembly room to talk over plans for a 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
branch of the League of Women Vot­
ers. A very good representation of 
the students was present, and a tem­
porary organization of a committee, 
which ¦will plan the meetings, was 
provided for. Ten students joined 
the league at once and the students 
are looking forward to a worth while 
meeting in December.
This mass meeting came as a re­
sult of Miss Walker’s talk on No­
vember 17. It is hoped that the 
women students and faculty of both 
the colleges, where women are en­
rolled, will take an interest and join 
this organization.
Teknon Club Holds Election; 
Miss Allison Made President
In the absence of Dr. Kerr, Mr. 
KirkPatrick led the discussion on 
India at the last meeting of the 
club. Mr. KirkPatrick, who has spent 
several years in India, was able to 
contribute a great deal of the Hindu 
point of view.
An election of officers took up the 
last part of the program. The result 
of the election was as follows: Presi­
dent, Miss Priscilla Allison; vice 
president, Rodney Patterson.
PERSONNAL DIRECTORY OUT
The Personnel Directory for 1922- 
1923 was issued today at Carnegie 
Institute of Technology. The direc­
tory is the annual publication that 
gives a complete roster of the Carne­
gie Tech administration staff, faculty 
and employes. With each name is 
given the position on the staff, heme 
address, telephone number and loca­
tion with the institute.
The issue for this year contains a 
directory of three hundred and nine­
ty-five names, a net increase of fif­
teen over that of the preceding year. 
Of the roster, eighty-seven are listed 
as new appointments.

NOTED SPEAKER 
CARNEGIE DAY
Sir Robert A. Falconer Gives 
Interesting Address on “The 
Fashioning of the English 
Speaking People”
MUSIC BY ORCHESTRA
Sir Robert Alexander Falconer, K. 
C. M. G., LL.D., F. R.S., president of 
the University of Toronto, a distin­
guished Canadian citizen, and a lead­
er in the educational work of Canada, 
delivered the principal address at the 
tenth annual observance of the birth­
day of Andrew Carnegie, at the Car­
negie Music 1-Iall on Carnegie Day, 
November 24.
In his address on “The Fashioning 
of the English Speaking Peoples.” 
Sir Robert gave a brief but compre­
hensive outline of the growth of civ­
ilization on the principle that “expe­
rience is the great teacher of the 
races of the world. It is accumulated 
experience and discipline that works 
out the character of men and women. 
Among the links which bind the peo­
ples of the world together, language 
is one of the strongest because it 
brings them into a closer relationship 
and a better understanding with each 
other.”
Sir Robert spoke of the valiant fight 
which Burke, that prince of orators, 
made in order to prevent the separa­
tion of the American colonies from 
England. “Notwithstanding this sep­
aration of the English race into two 
channels, there still exists among 
both streams a common heredity, the 
possession of similar moral convic­
tions and a knowledge of righteous­
ness. From the time of the rupture 
which resulted In the formation of the 
United States the two streams of Eng­
lish-speaking peoples have not had 
much in common until the World War, 
principally because of the great in­
flux of immigration to this country 
and because of the influence upon the 
United States of a rapidly receding 
frontier line during the nineteenth 
century.”

THANKSGIVING DAY
Annual Thanksgiving Dinner 
and Dance Will be Held 
in Hotel Chatham
By H. H. WILSON
With a white mantle covering the ground and the cold wintry winds 
whistling through the stands, Carnegie Tech went down to defeat 011 Forbes 
Field last Saturday at the hands of Knute Rockne’s Irish outfit from Notre 
Dauio, the final score standing at 19-0. It was a case of a game, hard fight­
ing team against a superior, well drilled outfit that had an abundance of sub­
stitute material. The Tartans fought every minute of the game, but were 
unable to consistently withstand the varied attacks of the Irish or to make 
any sustained advance toward tho enemy’s goal. On one occasion the Plaid 
cohorts did manage to register three fiist downs in a row, but this advance 
was soon brought to a stop by the strong defensive work of the Notre Dame 
men.
The first score came In the opening period when Notre Dame began a 
steady march down the field from their own 37-yard line. A11 end run for 
2S yards by Bergman brought tho hall well Into Plaid territory where a for-
W/rCTPnMF'FiO H/1 TFT plays took tho ball to tho Tartan 5- WtMfcKINfcKo lYvfctl :>'<»•<! Hne. Here Roclcne sent in two-
new backs, Layden and Stuhldreher, 
Willie Steffen substituted Krlstoff lor 
Comfort. On the next play Layden 
fumbled and tho ball rollod across tho 
goal lino where Stuhldreher recov­
ered It for a touchdown. Layden 
failed to add tho extra point by a 
dropklck and tho score stood at (5-0. 
I11 tho second quarter, after Notro 
Dame had been hold by tho stiffening 
defense of tho Slclbos, Layden 011 tho 
final down dropped back to tho 52- 
yard line and attempted a field goal 
by drop-kick. Tho try wont wide aiul 
Carnogio was given possession of tho 
ball 011 the 20-yard line. A little later 
In tho sumo quarter, Rockno’s men bo- 
gan anothor inarch and finding tho 
lino dofonso of tho Sklbos rather 
strong, uncorked a sorlos of forward 
passos which brought them within 
scoring distance. Iloro tho Tartan de­
fense again stiffened and the half 
ended with tho bull only a foot from 
tho goal lino.
it was In tho third porlod that tho 
StoffonlloH showed their only real 
offensive of the game, when they reg­
istered three first downs In a row. 
However, Anderson was finally forood 
to punt when tho Notro Dame lino 
withstood tho Tartan thrusts. At this 
point the hall wont deep Into Notro

on their two-yard lino although still

NEWMAN CLUB PROVINCE
DANCE TO BE HELD FRIDAYNIGHT ART STUDENTS 
ELECT NEW OFFICERS
The men’s Junior banquet has been 
jiostponed from December 8 to a date 
later on in the school year. This 
change became necessary when the 
sale of the Junior Prom preliminary 
tickets was being retarded by the 
sale of the banquet tickets. As these 
preliminary tickets are the means 
whereby the committee may secure 
contracts they should be bought im­
mediately. To offset any possibility 
of not having both functions attended 
by the entire Junior class the banquet 
committee decided to change the date 
of the banquet so as many as possible 
can go to both functions.
The Newman Club dance, to be 1 
held at the IC. of c. (Hall, Friday,; 
December 1, promises to be one of! 
the most delightful social events of! 
the season. It is being given in hon­
or of the delegates coming for the 
occasion, from the various colleges j 
of the province. A large number of j 
members from the West Virginia and' 
Western Reserve Clubs is expected i 
to attend. Coming as it does, dur-' 
ing the Thanksgiving vacation, it 
provides a gathering for all Catholic; 
college students spending their vaca-j 
tion in Pittsburgh. Excellent music j 
will be provided by Maggio’s Best.; 
Danriner is from nine until one.
On Wednesday, November 15, the 
Night Arts students elected their of­
ficers for the current year as follows: 
President, Sidney K. Eastwood; vice 
president, Frederick Fisher; secre­
tary, Rosamond F. Bruce; treasurer, 
Clarence W. Wood; representative of 
Board of Student Activities, E. C.

The advanages of the College of 
Fine Arts over the other divisions of 
tho institute has always boon appar­
ent to students of that division, but 
a step Is to bo taken In tho near fu­
ture which will doubtless cause a 
doubling of Its enrollment for the

Arts to the Rescue.
In order to direct young America
from this monstrous spectre of ap­
proaching ruin, the administration 
has resolved upon a progressive but 
farsighted policy. The College of 
Fine Arts is to have an entirely new
i
department, called Matrimonial Arts, 
under which will be developod an ex­
cellent four-year course leading to 
the degree of Batchelor of Sparks. It 
has long been apparent that the Arts 
Division has boon excellently Suited 
by natural environment for such a 
course of study, and Indoed, consid­
erable amateur work along this lino

students of tills division, No doubt 
a sense of gratification and relief 
will bo folt by all at this tromondoiiH 
stride In the march of American ed­
ucation.
Well Rounded Curriculum.
The course of study Itself will bo 
one designed to bring forth the nat­
ural talents that students are said 
to have developed in such a stimulat­
ing environment. While the subjects

NEW GYMNASIUM
At Inst we arc to liave some action on the new gymnasium pro­
ject; it lisis been definitely decided lo go ahead. The impatient linvc 
questioned often the probability of ever having a gym; however, 
this delay luí» brought tin an ideal location and better planned 
buildings'; this location is ideal because of its isolation from other 
school buildings; its proximity to the athletic field, which makes it 
possible to connect with our future stadium by a tunnel under the 
street. Before long concrete scats will be started in the bowl, which 
will be the first unit oil a fine athletic arena. Every school, in the 
country is planning for athletic training of its students; The import­
ance oil physical exercise can not be overestimated, because some col­
lege men never evert themselves physically; also good facilities make 
it easier to turn out good teams to represent Carnegie.
It has been announced that the gym will be ready J’or use next 
fall; this sounds good and we hope there will be no upset of the dope.
THE SEASON ENDS
The Carnegie Tartan congratulates tho men who played football 
and their conches, for the fine work they have done Ibis year. Tho 
season lias been a great success in spile of some reverses. Tho clean 
sportsmanship of our team is recognized by our opponents bceauso in

COMMENT ON THE GROWING
IMMORALITY OF OUR AGE
Hamlet said: "There is nothing
good or bad but thinking makes It 
so.” In our modern day many of the 
supposedly discreet assort that moral 
standard» of our ago are far below 
thcHo of the early periods. Thoughts 
of that nature do not permeate the 
minds of tho vast multitude but there 
are a large number of tho present liv­
ing, puritanic to the extreme, who In­
sist that each generation is becoming 
moro and more immoral. That re­
mark of Hamlet seems to contradict 
the truth of the statements of those 
"puro-minded” people.
Tho writer, in spite of tho conten­
tions of many of tho moral fanatics, 
»till InslHtu that Hamlet was right. 
There is no more evil in the present 
day than in the days of long ago. 
Tho pant differs only from tho present 
In that the proportion of those who 
think It bad is constantly growing. 
Those who look for the evil usually 
find it; that was true in the past as 
well as tho present. Thoso who think 
it evil make it so, and tho number 
of people who make things evil by 
thinking them ro is constantly being 
augmented.
In brief, those who in all earnest­
ness feel that they are working for 
the building up of tho moral standard 
of humanity are in reality tending to 
bring results of tho opposite nature. 
They themselves are the immoral; 
they make evil by thinking it so and 
are gradually spreading propaganda 
which is »lowly but surely causing 
others to think likewise.
ROAMIN’SKUAl'i KILT BAND PARADES 
TO FORBES FIELD
Real loyalty to the Alma Mater 
was shown by the fellows who de­
noted their services in the orchestra 
at the football banquet Saturday 
night. Men of their type are to be 
commended and deserve the support 
of the student body.
Football season is over. We will 
forget the games, but are wo going 
to forget the men on the squad? A 
genuine Tech man not only roots for 
tho team during the football season, 
but throughout the remainder of the 
school year. Show them that you are 
with them even after the gridiron 
ceases to call. Help them to catch 
up in the work that they missed dur­
ing tho long hours of practice.
Did you notice a peculiar thrill 
creep up your backbone at the first 
sight of the band in Icllts? Any one 
who ever went to Carnegie must have 
had that same thrill—a feeling that 
cannot be described but can only be 
experienced. If you didn’t have that 
thrill then there must be something 
wrong with you.
The exercises at the Music Hall on 
Friday were in commemoration of 
the birthday of Andrew Carnegie. 
Evidently the fellows who started the 
snake dance In the line of march 
thought it was a football rally. Roam- 
er enjoys a snake dance at the prop­
er time but his sentiments were that 
the march to the Music Hall should 
have been an orderly march with 
plenty of Carnegie Tech spirit but 
without the earmarks of a football 
rally. ,
ARTS THEATER
NIGHT SCHOOL STUDENTS
GIVE FOUR SHORT PLAYS
The Night students in the Depart­
ment of Drama at Carnegie Tech 
will present lour short plays this 
evening in the Arts Theater, College 
of 'Fine Arts. This will be the first 
offering by the students in the even­
ing classes.
The plays are: “The Yellow Bit-
lorn" by Daniel Cor leery, “On a May; 
Morning’' by Harold Brlghouse, "The 
Master of tho House'’ by Stanley 
HOughton, and “Cokey” by Harry L. 
Hamilton.
Mr. Hamilton, the author of 
"Cokey” is a Sophomore in tho day 
course in tho Drama Department. It 
is the latest of several plays he has 
written since he came to Carnegie. 
“Ronny’s Place," from his pen, was 
produced last spring during Campus 
Week, and for this .work, ho was 
widely praised by all who haw it.
This brilliant young writer, not! 
content with writing a current play, 
has a. new three-acl. comedy, which 
will go Into rehearsal at once. 
"You’re Noxt,” Is tho host work Mr. 
Hamilton has done. It will probably 
be prosontod just after tho Christ­
mas vacation.
Other plays In preparation by tlila 
gif tod author are: “Rose, Pink and
Amber," a. lmckslnge story; "Celle- 
glatoly Sipoiiklng," a collogo play; 
and a now "Nlggar" play to foatu.ro 
O. B. Newman.
Chester Wallace stages all of Mr, 
Hamilton's work, which is a largo 
factor In their suceoss.
Here’s to the Plebe who wears his 
Plebe cap at all times—both on and 
off tho campus; who lends a willing 
hand to any reasonable request for 
help; and who sticks to his class 
and lights for them when they are in 
need of help. If you are loyal to your 
class you cannot help but be loyal 
to Carnegie Tech and its ideals.
The Southern California Trojan 
says: "The students who fail to take 
part in college activities might just as 
well be taking a correspondence 
course.” The number of students of 
that type at Carnegie will be greatly 
reduced by the activities point re­
quirement for graduation.

Movies Taken of Band in 
New Uniform Saturday 
Morning
Amid a great outburst of applause 
from the student body and the public, 
the kiltie band and the pipers 
marched into Forbes Field last Satur­
day afternoon. They were fifty-five 
strong and from beneath the kilts of 
each bloomed forth a pair of red 
knees. Following the band was a 
large number of students, who showed 
that they were proud of the band and 
team, by waiting in line on the edge 
of Schenley Park for the band to ap­
pear and to lead them to the scene 
of battle. These students, who fol­
lowed the band made a great sacrifice, 
for by the time the parade reached 
the field, the best seats in the student 
cheering section had been taken. 
Were they down-hearted? No, they 
were proud to have the chance to 
march behind the largest and best 
kiltie band in the country.
On the other hand was the band 
cold and down-hearted? No, .they were 
warm and never happier in their life. 
Did anyone ever see the band act as 
cheerful as they did Saturday? And 
speaking about being cold, did you 
notice how little the band shivered 
compared to the people in the stands. 
It can best be told by how one of the 
members expressed it by saying, “The 
kilt uniform is warmer than ordinary 
clothing and more comfortable than 
the old blue uniforms.”
How many students were out watch­
ing tho band Saturday morning while 
they paraded about the campus and 
posing for their picture to be taken? 
Well if you were not out there you 
missed a joyful sight, while they stood 
around in the snow storm and greeted 
tho camera with a smile in order 
that a good picture of the kiltie band 
could be placed before the public by 
means of the movies. Everyone sure­
ly realizes that outside of the foot­
ball team this is the greatest adver- 
tising medium, which the school pos­
sesses.
Was there anyone who saw the kil­
tie band Saturday regrets that they 
had bought a kiltie tag during the 
campaign? Evidently not by the won­
derful way in which the band was 
cheered and treated throughout the 
day. The band as a whole certainly 
wishes to extend its thanks to the Y. 
M. C. A. for taking care of the over­
coats of the members and for obtain­
ing blankets for them to use during 
the game.

FOR THE GOOD OF CARNEGIE TECH
"All work and no play makes Jack 
a dull boy!”
Changing it a bit, we have:
All play and no work makes Jack 
a dull boy indeed!
How true it is! Things which are 
work for one are play for others. Is 
baseball play for the professional ball 
player? Not so as you may notice. 
Yet, I’m quite sure ’tis play for me. 
Nor could any man seduce me into 
admitting that the building of a log 
cabin for my use on a camping trip 
were anything else but a pleasure. 
Still, there are some who call this 
type of play, “work”—it is their vo­
cation, their business, their livelihood, 
which is the keynote of the Avhole 
thing. To work at a thing for a liv­
ing changes that thing from play to 
work, and vice versa.
To the tired business man, the stage 
offers an outlet for that energy, 
stored-up for pleasures. Psycholo­
gists say that this energy must re­
ceive an outlet, or work will suffer. 
It’s true too! Social work in mining 
camps, furnishing entertainment in 
the way of baseball games, movies, 
stunts, etc., are direct results of this 
psychological truth. »
All of which is just another way of 
saying that the actor, the playwright, 
the producer is a most important cog 
in the economic world. They are a 
necessity—that is to say, the good 
ones.
Let us see what the Carnegie Tech 
School of Dramatic Arts is doing. 
Last week we saw what it was.
So, getting to the facts, and pre­
senting them as facts. The following 
are some graduates of Carnegie Tech 
who are furnishing entertainment to 
the world:
Charles Meredith, leading man for 
Marguerite Clark, Constance Tal- 
madge, and other screen stars. He is 
now in Europe, planning the organiza­
tion of his own movie company.
Alexander Buchanan, general stage- 
manager of the New York Winter 
Garden.
Kenneth Thompson and Mary Ricar­
do, playing the two leads in a coast-to- 
coast tour of "Three Live Ghosts.” 
William Mulligan and Howard 
Claney, playing in “Liliom.”
Lois Shore, made a great success
j as the child in “Miss Lulu Bett.”
Eula Guy, playing the lead in “The 
| Hairy Ape.”
Hubbard Kirkpatrick, Arthur Lu- 
; bin, Burdette Kappes and Te Ata 
I Thompson, rehearsing in New Yorlc 
| for a new show: "Mon- Homme.” 
Eunice Osborne, with Mrs. Fiske. 
Elise Bartlett, now Mrs. Joseph 
J Scliildkraut, playing in "Liliom.”
| Ellen Crowe, ingenue with Jessie- 
j Boustelle Stock Company in Buffalo, 
i Frederick McConnell, K. Elmo- 
! Lowe, Max Eisenstat, Russell Collins, 
i Walfred Karlstrom, and Carl B. Reid,
; members of Mr. McConnell’s “The 
I Playhouse” in Cleveland, which has 
| successfully run for several years. It 
; is directed by Mr. McConnell, of Car- 
; negie Tech, the first man in the world 
| to receive an M. A. degree in drama.

MR. F. FALKN0R TALKS 
AT PHYSICS C0LL0QIUM
The speaker at the meeting on 
Friday, November 24, was a former 
ICarnegie student, Mr. Frank Falknor, 
who was enrolled as a physicist a 
few years ago. Mr. Falknor has 
made a specialty of radio engineer­
ing and has become acquainted with 
the intricacies of broadcasting. He 
discussed resistance coupling and 
transformer coupling and the effects 
of the cupereity of the elements of 
a thermonic vacuum tube. A fuller 
account of his paper will be given 
in a future issue. There will be no 
meeting of the colloquium this week 
on account of the Langmiur lectures 
and the holidays.

cerned, or money refunded, irrespec­
tive of age, weight, color or habitat. 
While there is some talk of erecting 
an additional building as headquar 
ters for the proposed course, it is 
generally conceded that the design 
of the Arts building has been excel­
lently suited in the past for the pur­
suit of such a study as outlined. Stu­
dents will be trained from matricula­
tion in the technique of gentlemanly 
proposals,' and it is predicted that 
this step will exert a tremendous in­
fluence toward the overcoming of the 
present-day tendency toAvards uncon­
ventional and ridiculous proposals of 
marriage.
Practical Work Necessary.
It has been given out by high au­
thority that no student will be eligi­
ble for the degree of Batchelor of 
Sparks unless she or he has .proven 
herself worthy t>y annexing at least 
one husband or wife in the course of 
four years. A bevy of parsons will 
ibe held ready at all time in the 
building so that after the victim has 
been successfully reduced to a state 
of coma, the fatal knot may be act­
ually tied before the spell wears off.
Spark Plug, the well known author­
ity upon the subject of “Parks and 
Sparks,” said when ‘questioned con­
cerning the proposed course "A very 
excellent idea. I shall enroll my 
cross-eyed daughter in this division 
at once."
(Continued from Page One) 
everyone knew that the time had 
come for a lively winter. The elec­
tion didn’t t^ke place until after the 
representative of the Board of Stu­
dent Activities, Mr. K. B. Weber, in 
his own manner, bad excited the peo­
ple about the great value of getting 
together as a student body, and thrill­
ed them by Ills stirring accout of the 
Interest that had been shown in pre­
vious years.
The students’ interest in the com­
ing dances and Campus Week celebra­
tion insures success. Not only was 
keen interest shown about these af­
fairs, but also in the promised schol­
arships. Mr. Frederick Fisher, chair­
man of the scholarship committee, 
will have more to say on this later.

“The Neiv Architecture”
ADIX iA
 DISTINCTLY new tendency is apparent in architectural 
thought and design today. Architects are designing in 
masses — the great silhouette, the profile of the building has 
become of far greater importance than its detail.
There is a new vigor and ruggedness even in buildings which are conven­
tionally classic in their detail. Masses mount upward, supporting the tower, 
accentuating its height. The new architecture is tending toward great struc­
tures rather than multiplicity of detail.
Certainly modern invention—modern engineering skill and organization, 
will prove more than equal to the demands of the architecture of the future.

PLAID ATHLETICS
DYKEMAN PLACES FOURTH
IN INTER-COLLEGIATES
NOT ENOUGH SCOTCH
Over Two Hundred Contest­
ants in Annual Classic
Pitted against the cream of Amer­
ica’s cross-country runners, Dykeman, 
Carnegie’s crack harrier, finished 
fourth against a field of over two hun­
dred contestants in the individual in­
ter-collegiate cross country champion­
ship race, run over the six-mile course 
in Van Cortlandt Park, New York 
City, last Monday.
The first man across the finish line 
was Higgins of Columbia, followed in 
quick order by Hendrix, of Massachu­
setts Institute of Technology, Smith, 
of Syracuse, Dykeman of Carnegie, 
and McLane, of the University of 
Pennsylvania. Higgins;, finished in 
the quick time of 32 minutes, 21 4-5 
seconds.
Syracuse University carried off the 
honors in the Varsity team race with 
75 points, while Yale trailed second 
with 108 points. Carnegie Tech did 
not have a team entered in this race, 
which decided the Eastern Inter-Colle­
giate Cross-country Championship.
This was the final meet of the sea­
son although there were only the two 
Carnegie Tech men entered, Dykeman 
and Ferrall. Dykeman was rated by 
the eastern newspapers as being a 
real menace to the other crack dis­
tance men from the eastern schools. 
He had to run against such good men 
as Higgins of Columbia, Mai Douglas, 
Yale’s star distance runner; R. E. 
Hendrie of M. I. T., Captain Kirby of 
Cornell, McLain of Penn and Homer 
Smith, Syracuse leader. These run­
ners presented some real competition 
to Dykeman and Ferrall. Eighteen 
colleges were scheduled to take part 
and the individual entries numbered 
two hundred and eighty-seven, a new 
record. The intercollegiates recall
that two of the intercollegiate cliam- 
I pions in recent years have come from ! 
| Pennsylvania, being Bob Crawford of i 
i Lafayette and Blondy Romig of Penn ; 
! State.
FRATERNITY BASKET 
BALL TO START SOON--------
Now that the football season is 
over and basket ball is ascending the 
throne of sportdom, the Inter-Frater­
nity Dormitory Basket Ball League is 
I starting developments under the di- 
i rection of the Y. M. C. A. This is 
j something new, although it will not 
! materially change the organization of 
j the league. The only changes will be 
I that the president of the league will 
I be a member of Student Cabinet in 
charge of athletics, and that the “Y” 
will have general supervision and will 
j aid the league financially and in any 
j other way possible. One thing which 
I the league will get through this me- 
| dium is two new basket balls to be 
I used in the games.
The different fraternities and dor- 
| mitori.es are advised to elect their 
managers as soon as possible. The 
president of the league states that he 
will call a meeting for Tuesday, De­
cember 5, at 4:30 in the “Y” club 
room, Industries building. At this 
| time' there will be a report of the 
eligibility committee and the appoint­
ment of a schedule committee besides 
the election of a secretary-treasurer.

The Carnegie Tech Freshman Re­
serve football team, which closed its 
season in a blaze of glory by over­
whelmingly defeating the strong In­
diana State Normal School on Novem­
ber 18, score 39-2, can truthfully be 
said to have been one of the best 
reserve teams ever turned out at this 
institution. With a whale of a line, 
a fast backfield, and above all, being 
well-coached, the team made an ex­
cellent showing, despite various ad­
verse circumstances winch arose dur­
ing the season.
In the first place, several of the 
most promising Plebes were lost to 
the team early in the season, being 
placed on the varsity squad. These 
men, had they been available for the 
Plebe team, would undoubtedly have 
strengthened it to such an extent that 
the Tartains would have had one of 
the best Freshman teams in the coun­
try. Then, during the season several 
of the regulars were injured and un­
able to take part in a couple of the 
games, weakening the team enough so 
that one game was tied and another 
lost by a small score. Also, Coach 
Beeler had to divide his time between 
the football team and the cross coun­
try outfit. Another thing, the schedule 
of the Plebes was rather irregular, 
and it was hard to keep the players 
pepped up and in condition between 
some of the games when there was a 
couple of weeks layoff.
The following is a record of the or­
der in which the games were played, 
and the scores of each; the Tartan 
Plebes won two games, tied one and 
lost three games:
Plebes 38—Westinghouse Tech 0.
Plebes 0—Slippery Rock Normal
LETTERS AND ’LECTIONS
At the Varsity Clan banquet last Saturday evening the following men | 
were announced as having won their letter in football: Anderson, Brum­
baugh, Comfort, Gilbert, Godden, Irwin, Lamb, Moran, Newman, Potter, Rob­
ertson, Rosenbloom Sprinkle and Zelt. Kristoff, Taylor and Wierman were 
awarded letters for their good work during the season.
The election of the 1923 football captain resulted in the selection of I-Iugh 
Sprinkle as the man to lead the red jerseyed team next fall. “Sprlnk” is a 
big fellow* ,a hard player and a good student and will surely make a popular 
leader on the gridiron.
At the same time Howard Dykeman was announced as having been 
elected to the captaincy of the Plaid harriers for next season. Dykeman is 
recognized as one of the best distance men in the east and will male a capa­
ble leader.
THE TRUTH ABOUT STEFFEN
There has been considerable agitation of late that Wally Steffen might 
not be back next year to handle the Plaid coaching reins at Carnegie Tech 
in spite of the fact that he has signed a contract. The facts of the matter 
are these: There is a law up for passage in the Illinois legislature to the
effect that judges cannot participate in other lines of work than their duties 
as judge. If this should go through it would mean that Wally would be 
unable to return next year as our mentor. However, Steffen himself makes 
the statement that the law does not have more than a hundred to one chance 
of passing and therefore there is no cause for worry.
CONTEMPORARIES?
The press box at the game had a pretty efficient gate keeper in the per­
son of a member of the police force for he absolutely refused to let in the Tar­
tan representative without a badge. We wonder if this gent was representing 
the Police Gazette and was covering the game for that sheet. But wo got 
a story just the same.
We’ve heard several comments concerning the poor way in which a 
certain downtown paper wrote us up 011 Saturday’s game. Wo don’t like to 
throw mud, hut why not give us a little credit for the game wo put up.

say. When, as we were crossing the 
Schenley bridge coming to the game, 
that big crowd in Forbes 
Field rose to their feet 
and gave cheer after cheer, then 
we didn’t mind anything. We didn’t 
care how cold it got after that. Noth­
ing could have kept us from going on.
The feeling thar was in our hearts 
can not he put in words or sentences 
by any writer. It is inexpressible, 
yet it is a feeling which every man 
has felt for his country and every 
college man for his Alma Mater. 
Why? Because we knew that on that 
cold day of snow and wind we were 
having a hand in something that was 
making the name ojLorirl A.1 ma_Mater 
more illustrious.1

the football season and Thanksgiving 
both being over; the place is ideal 
(thanks to Mr. McDonald, Manager) 
being in the busiest business block of 
East Liberty; the committee is good.

buy good cakes, pies, bread, rolls, 
cookies, doughnuts, salad dressing, 
candies, marmalades, pickles, etc. 
Even the male friends might be in­

evidence of our training! As has been 
said before, the affair is one that calls 
for the individual participation^, of 
every alumna in the Pittsburgh dls- 
'Ei'ict.^ Of course, contributions from 
away-from-Pittsburgh alumnae are al­
ways thankfully received.

Engineering Sells, Tooi
A whole lot of the make-believe has been 
eliminated from selling operations in the 
past ten years. The old idea that sales­
men were born to the sample-case, that 
they carried some sort of a special diplo­
ma from the University of Pooh, has had 
to break camp, along with the other 
exploded theo^ -which insisted that a 
salesman must be a “good fellow”, a man 
of strange habits, tremendous stories, 
and unquestioned qualities both as a 
mixer, and as an assimilator.
Now we. believe—nay, we know — 
that the best salesman is the man who 
knows most about liis goods, and can 
talk most interestingly about them.
This being the proven case, it isn’t so 
queer that engineering should find a real 
and effective application in the selling
field, especially if the merchandise mar­
keted is an engineering product that is 
bought and operated by engineers.
Every engineer who now engages in 
the sale and distribution of Westinghouse 
products feels that he is doing work 
worthy of his training—for he is carrying 
Service and Sincerity to Industry, and 
to mankind! He is out where the fighting 
is often the fiercest, and he is putting up 
a battle for the things that he believes 
are right. And a man can’t expect, nor 
ask, a bigger chance than that!
Sixty percent, approximately, of the 
engineering graduates who come to 
AVestingliouse find their way eventu­
ally into some phase of selling. And 
we are proud to have them there—and 
they are glad to be there!

his statement was correct. “The 
reason that I have done it, is because 
I have the ability.” And ho has, any­

Mr. Cartwright said: “I am glad I

before you men and get to you a little 
message to help you with a thing or 
two that will stick after I am gone. 
There isn’t a man here, not one, who,

Mr. Cartwright expressed his opinion 
that studonts should get a general 
knowledge, not specific. He argued 
tlmt men should know as much con­
cerning the world and its affairs as 
possible and not bo confined to one 
branch of Industry. Ho said in con-1 
eluding:- "Be born a man and die a 
bigger man.”
Following Mr. Cartwright's speech, 
the business of the assembly was 
taken up. The details of the Carnegie 
Day celebration wore announced and 
Mr. Waddell urged everyone to show 
roal Carnegie spirit at the Notre Dame 
game.
Following the invocation by the 
Rev. Percival IT. Barker of the Point 
Breeze Presbyterian Church, Dr. 
Baker spoke of tliq significance and 
of the importance of Carnegie Day, 
which has been set aside each year 
as a day upon which we can pay hom­
age to the founder of our school and 
upon which we should consecrate 
ourselves anew to the task of con­
tinuing the noble work which Andrew 
Carnegie began in the founding of this 
institution. Dr. Baker read to the 
large assemblage of faculty members, 
alumni, visitors and students, a letter 
from Mrs. Louise W. Carnegie, in 
which she expressed a deep lO.^ret 
that she was unable to attend the 
exercises, a warm regard for the In­
stitution, and a great interest In its 
work. A formal announcement of the 
fellowships, scholarships and prizes 
for the current school year was made 
at this time.
