Flaherty Answers 
Students Queries
by MURRAY SINGER
A full Wherrett Room listened Thursday as Pete Flaherty gave 
his version of the Pittsburgh mayoralty campaign. Before tackling 
the many questions that were waiting him. Mr. Flaherty discussed the 
significance of his candidacy as an 
independent Democrat.

Dr. Werhner von Braun, rocket expert and renowned space scientist, speaking to a capacity crowd in the-
Skibo ballroom Oct. 29: “After Apollo—What?”
Werner von Braun Speaks 
On Future Space Programs
He told the audience that he 
had not solicited the support of 
Mayor Barr, but that he could not 
even have prevented it had he 
not wanted it. Flaherty, however, 
has refused the endorsement of 
the Democratic ward chairmen, 
while John Tabor has accepted 
the endorsement of all 32 Re­
publican chairmen. Mr. Tabor’s 
accusation that Flaherty was tied 
to the Democratic machine was 
interpreted by Flaherty as a real­
ization on the part of his oppon­
ent both that a candidate should 
be independent, and also that he 
(Tabor) himself is an integral 
part of the Republican organiza­
tion. The people are tired of hav­
ing a mayor tied to provate in­
terests, Flaherty told the audience 
He sees this issue as very im­
portant in deciding a great pro­
portion of the uncommitted votes.-
Continuing, Pete described 
how Pittsburgh was not receiving 
I full returns in education and 
crime control for its tax dollars.
I He stressed the importance of the 
I role of the mayor in bringing 
I these matters to the attention of 
I state and federal officials. Ta- 
|bor was criticized for not givingI
 black groups the same informa­
tion that white groups had re­
ceived with respect to racial is­
sues . . . Playing one group 
against the other would never 
I yield fruit, and although he 
"could not forsee all segments of 
society immediately settling their 
differences and working together 
harmoniously. Mr. Flaherty did 
say that one way of approaching 
this end would be to try to pro­
mote respect for the differences 
of others.
In response to having been 
called a dreamer. Mr. Flaherty 
noted that Rovert Kennedy had 
once replied to the same ac­
cusation by saying. "Some see 
things as they are and ask why?' 
I dream of things that never 
were, and ask why not?”
A hectic question and answer 
seriod then began. Asked what 
iis approach to the construction 
crisis would be, Mr. Flaherty 
»aid that he would become di- 
ectly involved in negotiations. 
>ecause the current group act- 
ng as intermediary is essential- 
y powerless. Flaherty stated that 
ie favored a more reasonable 
ength for the apprenticeship 
»rogram (now four years), the 
bolition of discrimination in 
he admission procedures, and 
he development of standard tests 
or admission.
Flaherty was then asked what 
itluence he could possibly have 
n men in Washington or Har- 
isburg without being associated 
>th the machines of either ma- 
)r party. He replied that even 
e*ng tied to the party in power
did not guarantee results, and 
the lower level politicicians 
are often told not to rock the 
party boat when attempting to 
exert pressure on state or federal 
legislators. He felt that as an in­
dependent Democrat he would be 
in a position to rock both boats 
if he so desired, but that results 
were obtained more readily not 
by means of influence but by 
making reasonable demands.
One student asked whether the 
total of 4 votes cast against the 
Barr administration (out of 2000 
for) indicated Flaherty’s true ties 
to the party. Flaherty sidestep­
ped this one by pointing out 
that many of those votes cast in 
favor of the Administration were 
for programs which his opponent 
both now supports and is also 
criticizing Flaherty for having 
supported.
Flaherty gave specific answers 
to several queries. He told the 
audience that he favored for 
Pennsylvania the New Jersey 
standards for air pollution which 
are the strictest in the country. 
He lamented the fact that, in this 
matter it was Allegheny County 
which was responsible for enforc­
ing relevant laws, and stated 
that the city should have concur­
rent rights. He also felt that be­
fore changing the present laws 
on the use of drugs more infor­
mation is necessary. He stated 
that mere use of mariujana 
should not be a felony, and that 
is possible that further investiga­
tion might support the view that 
use should not be a crime at all.
To the question of how he 
would handle a race riot. Mr. 
Flaherty asserted that he would 
try to prevent such an occur- 
rance by improving housing, 
promoting fuller employment, 
and increasing educational bene­
fits for all. But when again ask­
ed how he should specifically 
deal with a riot, he stated that all 
one could do was be prepared 
and try to thwart disturbances be­
fore they became full-blown.
Mr. Flaherty seemed some­
what harried toward the end of 
the session when the questions 
were flying thick, fast and dif­
ficult. He was obviously anxious 
to cut off discussion at its pre­
arranged one-hour length. In the 
final ten minutes, Flaherty was 
asked 1) how he would attach 
talented people to relatively 
low-paying management jobs 
with the city; 2) how to com­
pete with private industry in 
this respect; 3) why he hadn't, 
as city councillor, done anything 
to help alleviate the disturbances 
in the schools; and 4 • how he would 
keep the Tactical Police Force 
in check and even take action 
against policemen for excessive 
use of force.

The famed rocket and space sci­
entist. Werner von Braun, visited 
the campus Thursday evening. 
Oct. 30. to address Carnegie-Mel- 
lon University. It comes as no 
surprise that invitations were 
mailed to faculty members and 
“ friends of the University” only. 
The few C-MU students who were 
present were held spellbound by
An understanding the identity 
of the African and the Afro- 
American cannot be approached 
from a single angle. The many cul­
tural and social inputs that make 
up the black identity must be con­
currently examined in order to 
improve both blacks and whites 
knowledge of African culture.
The sponsors of the African 
Symposium. 'Cultures in Con­
tact.” have designed a diverse 
program in an attempt to fulfill 
the need for a many-faceted ap­
proach. Recognizing that simply 
presenting historical African 
background, for example, they 
would not be initiating an inte­
grated understanding, the SPIRIT 
and the International Club have 
added musical traditions, student 
dramatic productions and an ex­
amination of Black studies pro­
grams on university campuses to 
the week's events.
von Braun’s bag of tricks as his 
predominantly middle-age audi­
ence grew reassured that the 
American space program was A- 
OK
Dr. von Braun's proposed 
theme was "After Apollo — 
What?” From his speech I de­
duced that “More Apollo” was the 
answer to that question. The first
The rising nation states in Afri­
ca have had an incalculable impor­
tance in altering the power bal­
ance in the world as well as creat­
ing a new identity base for Black 
peoples in other, countries. Speak­
ing on the topic of recent trends 
in African political and social his­
tory. His Excellency E. M. De- 
brah. Ambassador of Ghana to the 
United States, will address an au­
dience in the Skibo Ballroom to the 
at 11:30 a.m. Thursday on "Na­
tion Building in West Africa.” Am­
bassador Debrah was a member 
of the Ghana delegation to the Afri­
can Summit meeting which cul­
minated in the foundation of the 
Organization for African Unity 
and leader of the Ghana delega­
tion to the Eighth Session of the 
United Nations Economic Com­
mission for Africa. For many 
years. Ambassador Debrah has
half of the talk was devoted to the 
well-known facts of the Apollo 11 
mission. But things started really 
rolling along as von Braun de­
scribed several Apollo-like pro­
grams—more tricks, more dra- 
mama, more flag wavings, etc.
For the future von Braun fore­
sees a space station in orbit in 
early 1971, a space shuttle sys­
tem within the next decade, and a 
space base by 1980. He also 
spoke of new industrial potential 
in the zero gravity environment 
of space. One example of these 
new techniques is the manufac­
ture of metal foams. This process 
would involve melting two metals 
together until one of them evap­
orates to form gas pockets in the 
molten alloy. This gas would nor­
mally rise to the surface of the 
metal, but will not do so in space 
becuase of the lack of gravity. 
Thus when the alloy solidifies, it 
will retain a swiss cheese effect. 
The one use for such metal foams 
which Dr. von Braun suggested— 
its use in jet propellors hardly jus­
tifies the great cost of a program 
such as our space journeys.
But Dr. von Braun the apologet­
ic had answers for those who crit­
icize the expenditures for space 
exploration He spent a great 
deal of time elaborating upon a 
plan of crop surveying by infra­
red photography which he explain­
ed would benefit the impoverish­
ed immeasurably. But Dr. von 
Braun gave no projected date for 
the incorporation of such a pro­
gram into a space vehicle. I as­
sume that until the space officials 
find the money for such a project 
we must be statisfied with the 
assurance that the project is pos­
sible and that they are thinking 
about it. Until then, there will be 
only Apollo.

Herb Alpert 
To Play At
Herb Alpert and the Tijuana 
Brass will make their annual 
visit to Pittsburgh this year at the 
Civic Arean on Monday, Novem­
ber 17, 1969 at 8:30 p.m. This 
trip will mark the fourth time 
in as many years that Mr. Al­
pert and the Brass have perform­
ed in Pittsburgh. The past three 
appearances have been to capa­
city audiences.
Along with Herb and the TJB 
will be the popular singing star of 
television and records 0. C. 
Smith.
Herb Alpert was born to a 
musically inclined family on 
March 31, 1935 in Los Angeles. 
He started playing trumpet at the 
age of nine when he considered 
the practice to be more time- 
consuming than reqarding. Herb 
cut his first single record, 
“Lonely Bull” and “Acapulco 
1922“ in 1962. The first album 
came out four months later. At 
that time the TJB was still basi­
cally an unorganized group and 
they remained that way until 
1965. Unlike so many leaders 
in an often unstable profession, 
Herb Alpert has managed to keep 
his sidemen with him through the
and Brass 
Civic Arena
years without a single change. 
They find the work rewarding, 
both musically and materially; 
all of them are versatile studio 
musicians with a variety of cre­
dits in both pop music and jazz.
Since 1967 Herb has starred 
annually in his own self-produced 
TV special. All the shows have 
been given repeat plays. One, in 
1968, had the rare distinction of 
being seen first on CBS and 
then on NBC.
O. C. Smith, who was with the 
Count Basie organization for 
three years has become very 
popular since his hit recording of 
“Little Green Apples.” His re­
cent television guest sports in­
clude the “Lena Horne Special.”
The concert, originally sche­
duled for October 13, was post­
poned until November 17 to 
allow the TJB to finish a tele­
vision special which was aired on 
October 29. Tickets purchased 
for the original concert will be 
honored for this concert along 
with thckets now available at 
all National Record Marts and 
the Civic Arena Box Office, Gate 
1.

A frican Sym¡)os i u m
Ecstatic Dances of Olatunji
(Editor's Note: Babatunde Ola­
tunji and his company will be 
performing in the C-MU Gymnas­
ium as part of the African Sym­
posium, Saturday, November 8, at 
8:30 p.m. All members of the C- 
MU campus community will be 
admitted without charge with an 
I.D. card. The following is a re­
view by Peter Altman, as reprint­
ed from the Minneapolis Star.
"If you made it to the perfor­
mance of African music and 
dance that was offered in the Guth­
rie Theatre Sunday, the chances 
are that everything you see for the 
next few weeks will seem tame to 
you.
The event, featuring Olatunji 
and his troupe and presented by 
Walker Art Center in connection 
with the gallery's show of Art of 
the Congo was the most relent­
less. enervating, overpowering 
total experience to be seen here in 
months.
The energy and enthusiasm of 
the ensemble, featuring five dan­
cers. three drummers on differ­
ent types of skins and three other 
musicians playing African in­
struments. dramatized impress­
ively how refined and how inhi­
bited western music is. It is not 
at all patronizing to say the Afri­
can blend of percussion and mo­
tion had a primitive power that 
was staggering.
The bright-colored robes, ecsta­
tic movements, rhythmic fren­
zies and wild swings of mood 
probably could not be managed 
convincingly by anyone who has 
grown up in midcenturv Ameri­
ca. We would be too self-con­
scious.
This troupe's members are all 
African in origin: clearly they have 
grown up with what to us is ex­
otic culture. Drummer Olatunji. 
who provided articulate and illum­
inating commentary, has a bit of 
the folk lorist about him; as he 
said, he strongly feels he is spread­
ing the gospel by taking this 
music-dance program around the 
world. He also hopes to give U.S. 
Negroes a sense of pride in being 
black by alerting them to their 
native cultural traditions.
But there was nothing folkv 
about the performance that was 
given vesterdav. This wa<
adult extension course in Afri­
can art, but the real thing, flesh 
and blood, happening before us. 
I cannot say whether the dancers 
and musicians really believed the 
legends behind the mask dance, 
based on reincarnation, but they 
performed as if they did. Sim­
ilar convictions came across 
with welcome, challenge and play 
dances.
The music was basically rhy­
thmic, but even in all-drum num­
bers there was significant tonal 
quality. Oltunji played two 
red and yellow drums almost as 
tall as he is; Ladji Camara had 
a smaller instrument, topped 
with bells and silver reflectors; 
and both got fantastic ranges of 
sound and tempo from their 
instruments. There were also mar- 
acas-type shakers and a cowbell- 
wooden stick instrument in most 
numbers.
But this was music that words 
cannot describe. It was surges 
and LSD colors and a vibrating 
universe and superstition and 
waves of bodies and rattles and 
blond straw wigs and frighten­
ing masks and a dancer who seem­
ed 12 feet tall inside a tent. In 
the Guthrie, it was right up next 
to the spectator. Where do you go ' 
to recover?”

Tuesday, November 4, 1969—THE TARTAN—Page 3A Report on Our Tax System: , , , ,, ,, , r. . or ii Morehead and (JarkMany Injustices & Loopholes x0 Speak Next Week
by STEVE JURMAN
Spo’tin' Life said it. and it is 
as true for us as it was for the in­
habitants of Catfish Row. For 
example, millions of Americans of 
all classes are mobilizing to force 
an end to the war in Vietnam. 
This is good, because the war is a 
terrible unjust action morally 
and a disaster practically.
But it isn’t very good because 
many of these people don’t 
realize that the war in not a to­
tally isolated evil, that all our 
problems are not solved by end­
ing it. At best, the war is a symp­
tom which has formed over the 
past 250 years. At worst it is a 
product of a massibe conspiracy 
against the great majority of 
the world’s population.
It is the purpose of this column 
to report on various aspects of 
this system — on specific flaws 
in our democracy, certain social 
injustices, certain crimes against 
the American people — in the 
hope that a few people might be 
enlightened and inspired to take 
action against those evils.
It is fairly obvious that in­
comes are not evenly distributed in 
America, are in fact highly un­
evenly distributed. In 1967 the 
top 5 per cent of tax units were 
receiving 20 per cent of the in­
come in the U.S., and .that 
the top fifth of the units were get­
ting 45 per cent of the income. The 
lowest fifth were making 4 per­
cent of the income, with the bot­
tom 10 per cent bringing home 1 
per cent. Obviously talent, pro­
ductivity, and initiative deserve 
extra (assuming that those are 
what is earning the extra) but 
one must still wonder about the 
10 per cent of the people making 
1 per cent of the income. How­
ever, we have a progressive sys­
tem that taxes the rich more 
heavily to benefit the poor.
Or do we?
The Federal income tax is pro­
gressive. the 20 per cent base 
rate increasing by stages to 
70 per cent on incomes of $500. 
000 or over. However, the effec­
tive tax rate, or what is actually 
collected, is far lower. The very 
poor fare well here; 68 per cent 
of those earning under $3,000 pay 
only 0-5 per cent. Those at the 
other end of the scale fare even 
better. A complicated arrange­
ment of exemptions and loop­
holes lowers the effective rate 
for the very rich from 70 per 
cent to 25 percent.
One example is untaxed income, 
such as expense accounts. A 1959 
study reported that two thirds of 
corporate executives consider­
ed expense accounts as tax-free 
compensation. A 1957 Treasury 
report estimated such income at 
from 5 to 10 billion dollars.
Many executives take their sal­
aries in part in stock options, 
which allows them to buy stock 
at less than market prices. This 
gimmick utilizes the capital gains 
tax (on income from stocks or the 
sale of property held over six 
months) of only 25 per cent or 
less to raise profits even more. 
In 1957, 20 per cent of income in 
the $100,000 plus class was in capi­
tal gains.
Many more exemptions and loop­
holes exist, many too complica­
ted for the layman to understand 
and most impossible for the poor to 
utilize.
The extreme effect of wuch tax 
dodges is seen in 1967 when 155 
tax returns listing incomes over 
$200,000 paid no taxes at all. 
Twenty one of those incomes were 
over one million dollars.
Another item worth consider­
ing is the corporate income tax, 
another mainstay of the federal 
tax structure. Corporations find 
this one more item to be passed on 
to the consumer, and at least 
two thirds of it is, to the detri­
ment of the poor, mainly.
The poor aren’t directly shaf­
ted by the federal government. 
That is reserved for the state 
and local governments, whose 
taxes are highly regressive, bas­
ed primarily on sales taxes 
whose main impact is on the 
poor and lower middle class. 
An added evil is that while fed­
eral taxes have remained fairly 
stable, state and local taxes are 
increasing yearly.
The effect of all taxes together 
is devastating to low income 
groups. All taxes together take up 
44 per cent of the income of those 
under $2,000 a year (1965 figures). 
The middle classes average about 
27 per cent. The higher classes 
pay in the vicinity of 38 per cent, 
small in relation to their larger 
incomes and various free bene­
fits.

next week here. The first will be Rep. William S. Morehead, 
of the 14th Congressional District of Pennsylvania. Moor­
head will speak on Monday, November 10. On Tuesday, the 
Board will present Arthur C. Clark, inventor of the communi­
cations satellite and co-author of the book “2001: A Space Od­
yssey.” _______________________________________
Moorhead, whose constituency 
is located in the heart of Pitts­
burgh. is a native of the city. 
He was elected to the 86th Con­
gress on November 4, 1958, and 
re-elected to subsequent Congres­
ses. He is a member of the Com­
mittee on Banking and Currency 
(serging on its Subcommittee on 
Housing, Subcommittee on In­
ternational Finance, and Subcom­
mittee on Bank Supervision and In­
surance, of which he is chairman;) 
the committee on Government 
Operations (serving on its subcom­
mittee on Government Activities, 
Subcommittee on Research and 
Technical Programs, and Sub­
committee on Military Operations; 
and the Joint Economic Com­
mittee.
Recently Mr. Moorhead has 
been involved in a fight to reduce 
military spending and use this 
money for domestic benefits.
The Representative will address 
the University community on 
November 10th at 4:30 p.m.
Mr. Clark will speak in the 
Ballroom at 11:30 on Tuesday, 
November 11th, on the topic of
his latest book, “The Promise of
Space.”
Clark is an authority on space 
travel, and the winner of the 
Franklin Institute’s Gold Medal 
(1963) for having originated the 
communications satellite in a tech­
nical paper published in 1945.
In 1965 he shared an Oscar 
nomination with Stanley Kubrick 
for the screenplay of “2001.” 
Clark is a top-ranking science 
writer and the author of 40 books, 
both fiction and non-fiction. Pre­

Venture:Purify water with the fiber that made men whistle.
Nylon. Reverse osmosis.
A fiber that started making girls' legs more beauti­
ful some 30 years ago.
And a process that's been around a lot longer.
But when Du Pont scientists and engineers look 
at them in a new way, they combine into an idea that 
can change the world.
Reverse osmosis is a purification process that 
requires no phase change. It's potentially the cheap­
est way to desalinate water.
Du Pont’s innovation? Hollow, semipermeable ny­
lon fibers much finer than human hair. Symmetrical, 
with an outer diameter of .002 inch and a wall thick­
ness of .0005 inch, with an accuracy of manufacture 
maintained at close to 100%. Twenty-five to 30 million 
of them encased in a precisely engineered unit 14 
inches in diameter by 7 feet long.
The result: a semipermeable surface area of about
85,000 square feet—the size of a 2-acre lot—and up 
to 10,000 gallons of desalted water per day.
So far "Permasep”® permeators have been used 
experimentally to purify brackish and polluted water, 
and in various industrial separations. But the po­
tential to desalt seawater, too, is there.
So Du Pont scientists and engineers are even now 
working toward improved fibers, units and plant 
designs that should make it possible to get fresh 
water from salt at a price that any town or nation 
can afford.
Innovation—applying the known to discover the 
unknown, inventing new materials and putting them 
to work, using research and engineering to create 
the ideas and products of the future—this is the 
venture Du Pont people are now engaged in.

"Cultures”
(Continued from tbyB Fl 
been a leader in African politics 
and instrumental in developing a 
sense of African unity.
The influence of Africa is not 
limited to its political importance 
on the world scene; its powerful 
culture has had an enormouse 
impact in the West in both musical 
and artistic achievements.
Recognizing this, the Symposi­
um will present both native Afri­
can music and its off-springs in 
America. Beginning tonight, a 
Gospel singing group will perform 
at 7:30 p.m. in the Wherrett 
Room. Gospel music is a pure 
American sound. The rhythm is 
African, but the people who creat­
ed this sound were snatched from 
their native soil and brought to a 
country where everything was a 
new experience. The pain, suffer­
ing, and harsh treatment they en­
countered had to be relieved in 
some way—so they sang.
Continuing this theme on Wed­
nesday night at 7:30 p.m. in the 
Wherret Room, Miss Maudelena
Johnson will lecture on the topic 
of Negro spirituals. She will give 
added insight into the “Black folk 
song,” so much a part of the 
American musical past. Thursday 
night, the “Third World Ensem­
ble” will fuse Gospel with other 
types of music to create a sound 
that is the Black man today.
From these demonstrations 
and presentations of American 
Black music, the Tymposium will 
switch its emphasis to perform­
ances of authentic African mu­
sic. On Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. 
in the Wherret Room, Dr. Halim 
El-Dabh, professor of musicolo­
gy at Kent State University, will 
present “African Music—Tribal 
and National.” Professor El- 
Dabh’s demonstrations and dis­
cussions have been widely ac­
claimed—and should not be miss­
ed.
The musical climax of the Sym­
posium will "happen” in the Gym 
Saturday night at 8:30 p.m. when 
Olatunji will present his ‘ Drums 
of Passion Revue. "
The striking resemblance of 
modern American abstract art to 
native African forms has been
noted by many prominent art crit­
ics and historians. African art 
from a number of countries is on 
display throughout the week in the 
Skibo lobby. In addition, a fam­
ous collection of African art is 
presently on display at the Carne­
gie Institute.
To dramatically express the 
Black student's attitudes, opin­
ions and emotions, two Black stu­
dents, Tom Payne, author, and 
Bill Charles, director, will pre­
sent Wednesday night at 8 in the 
Wherret Room. "Black Rap No. 
1: a Black Student’s Fairy Tale."
The Symposium may also have 
lasting effects if it serves to cry­
stallize the interest in inclusion 
of a more extensive Black studies 
program in the C-MU curriculum. 
To integrate all the events of the 
week. Dr. Richard Stevens, pro­
fessor and head of African Stud­
ies at Lincoln University of Penn­
sylvania. will speak at 11:30 a.m. 
Friday in the Wherret Room on 
"The Relevance of African Stud­
ies to the American Scene.” He 
will express his views and rec­
ommendations of the importance 
of developing Black Studies pro­
grams on American college cam­
puses.Professor Halim El-Dabh of Kent State.

Beaux Arts Ball Has Come A Long Way
by JAMIE EDLIN
In the very early 1900’s, forty- 
four architectural firms submit­
ted schemes for consideration to 
build a ‘ first class technical 
school.” Henry Hornbostel won 
the competition. After solving 
nearly every architectural problem 
connected with the building of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Mr. Hornbostel became the first 
Head of the Department of Ar­
chitecture, on the trustees invi­
tation. In Porter Hall on October 
16, 1905. he welcomed those first 
students whose $20 had purchased 
a year’s instruction in architec­
ture.
“The architect of the campus 
cut a most dashing figure. Below 
his elegant vandyke jutted a bow- 
tie of bright plaid material which 
legend claimed was purchased 
by the reel. Other legends grew 
up around Henry Hornbostel, 
and he apparently did little 
to discourage them. Beaux Arts 
man as well as Beaux Arts ar­
chitect, he was forever fond of sug­
gesting Tech’s adoption of many 
of the ideas that produced the 
camaraderie of his free wheel­
ing student days at the Ecole des 
Beaux Arts in Paris. Perhaps 
his most popular extracurricular 
suggestion was recorded in a 
1911 Tartan when he proposed 
an annual masquerade ball. The 
result was the Beaux Arts Ball.” 
(Carnegie Technical, 1964).
The April 18, 1912 issue, of the 
Tartan flashes, ‘‘The laying of 
the Design School cornerstone is 
an event of no minor importance. 
To attend the laying of the cor­
nerstone a pageant has been plan­
ned . . . with costumes ... a 
crowning touch of yesterday in 
this wholly modern procedure. As 
Mr. Hornbostel says, it is an 
event of a lifetime.’ and it should 
be made a complete success re­
gardless of other interests.”
‘‘Before approaching any dis­
cussion of motifs for the annual 
costume ball of the School on Ap­
plied Design, a short resume of 
its history and a statement of its 
scope and reason for being is per- 
missable. The interception of 
the idea was at the time of the 
Pageant of the laying of the cor­
nerstone in 1912. This event con­
sisted of a very spectacular out­
door parade of the Peoples of 
Earth. From this auspicious begin­
ning developed the idea of the 
costume ball on lines suggested 
by the Patron Mr. Henry Horn­
bostel. In 1913, the Roman Ball 
was given in the architectural 
draughting room of the newly 
completed building. In it was 
born a spirit of artistic revelery, 
an abandonment to the Idea of 
the Night, the thing that signals 
the dawn of esthetic apprecia­
tion. The Oriental Ball was held 
in 1914, the Midieval Ball, in 
1915, and a Slavonic Ball was 
held in 1916. A definite idea 
dominated each event. The de­
corating of the foyer and corri­
dor, the study, planning, and exe­
cution of the costumes, the selec­
tion of the music and the crea­
tion of the atmosphere and spirit 
of the period.” (Tartan, Oct. 
24,1917). and____
November 12. 1914. ‘‘Oriental 
Ball a Brilliant Affair.”
April 29. 1914. “Roman Festi­
val and Dance.” "The Roman Fes­
tival held in the Design School 
was the most successful of the 
year. The festival is the first of 
its kind held in Carnegie, the idea 
originating with Mr. Hornbostel. 
The different departments have 
become more acquainted with 
each other and from now on 
will co-operate in favor of a more 
eventual school life.”
October 20, 1915. “Design Mas­
que and Ball Coming.” “Here is 
a most excellent opportunity for 
a tincture of Design Art to assert 
itself. You cannot produce art and 
leave man out; all art must sug­
gest something. Here is an oppor­
tunity for an adequate expres­
sion of beauty. Maturity is not the 
acme of beauty because in ma­
turity there is nothing more to 
hope for. Only the incomplete, 
the immature, fills the heart for 
from it we construct the ideal.”
March 29. 1916. “Paramount 
in Every Way’ Said N. Y. Cri­
tic.” “The fancy dress ball giv­
en by the School of Applied 
Design has attracted attention 
everywhere. Such occasions serve 
as an outer tonic to the imagina­
tion without which no man can 
become real. The sooner we larn 
to indulge often in such revel, 
the happier will be our college 
remembrances and the more bene­
ficial.”
December 13, 1916. “The
greatest event of the school year 
..........the costume fete.”

six hours joyous carefree revelry 
The Ball was brilliant.”
The biggest annual bash on cam- 
pusnfor four decades, the ball 
seems to have stopped rolling 
when it ran afoul of a Student 
Congress investigation. For sev­
eral years the space that had once 
occupied the ball was vacant, 
due to accusations blocking the 
way. However, one fine day in 
the Spring of 1966. an article 
appeared in the Tartan announ­
cing “The Superball” to be held 
in March. It was to follow the 
pattern established in 1924; it 
was a Fine Arts affair open to
fine arts students, faculty, and 
their guests. It, too. was a great
success.
There was an aspect of the 
"Superball” which became more 
evident in its successor, “Satori,” 
that pointed to a definite change 
in the formula of Fine Arts 
balls. Disapproval of the ball be­
ing closed outside of Fine Arts 
students and faculty grew and 
grew. The “Superball” said 
it was a closed affair, but sold 
tickets under the table to any­
body who wanted one. “Satori” 
announced that it was open to the 
entire school, but it's date coin­
cided with Spring Carnival.
From the looks of things, it 
would seem as though this year the 
ball wants to depart altogether 
from tradition. The merriment will 
begin on Valentine’s Day week­
end in the Fine Arts building.
Valentine’s Day serves as the 
point of departure for the theme, 
the “Cardiac Revival.” The heart 
is the spiritual center of the body, 
the home of the emotions.
The organization for the mas­
que hopes to co-ordinate techni­
cal skills from people of all de­
partments. A bulletin board near 
the men’s room in the basement 
of Fine Arts will carry all an­
nouncements concerning organ­
izational meetings. Committees 
for decoration and design, enter­
tainment, graphics, and publicity 
are open to the interested.
Due to the large demand for 
advertising posters in years past, 
hand-made silk-screened posters, 
announcing “The Cardiac Re­
vival,” will be sold in mid- 
November. Free tickets to the af­
fair will be given away with 
each poster.

Tartans Wallop Johns Hopkins, 42-0 
Defense Excels,- Bell Scores Three TD's
It’s too bad that Johns Hop­
kins picked Baltimore for its 
home base. They brought a 3-2 
record into Saturday afternoon’s 
contest against our team from 
CMU which was 1-4. They whip­
ped the Tartans last year 52- 
38 last year. But this is 1969 and 
they didn’t have a chance.
The Tartans registered their 
second victory of the season Sa­
turday by blanking the Blue- 
jays 42-0. This was the second 
shutout for the Tartans in two 
years. Terry Bell continued to 
spark the CMU offense by scor­
ing on two runs and one pass 
reception. Bell now leads the 
Tartans in scoring with 54 points.
The early defeats of the Tar­
tans were characterized by un­
timely penalties, fumbles and in­
terceptions. As the score indica­
tes, this game was different. It 
was the Bluejays who made the 
crucial errors and the Tartans 
were able to capitalize each 
time.
The first CMU score, a nine 
yard run by Bell, came after 
Chuck Price recovered a fumble 
on the home team’s twenty yard 
line. The next time the Tartans 
got the ball, they wasted no 
time as Rich Squires tossed a 46 
yard touchdown pass to Price. 
This was Pric’s fifth scoring 
grab of the season.
While the Tech defense con­
tinued to stop Johns Hopkins’ 
offensive efforts, the Tartans 
moved into the end zone again 
when Tom Lombardo ran it in 
from the seven. Before the half 
ended the Tartans got another 
break when the Blue jay punt 
barely made it to their own 35. 
This time it took CMU five plays 
to score, with Squires scoring on 
an eight yard keeper.
The two final Tartan touch­
downs came in the third quarter. 
Terry Bell scored the first on a 
five yard run and the second on 
a thirty-two yard pass play.
In the last two CMU victor­
ies, the Tartan offense has gain­
ed a total of 76 points and 911 
yards.

Soccer Team Wins 1-0 
For Fifth Victory Of Season
by ALLAN HENDERSON
The CMU soccer team defeat­
ed Pitt-Johnstown 1-0 at the 
Tech Bowl Saturday. The win 
brought Coach March Kortee’s 
team record to 5-3-1 with one 
game remaining.
The lone goal of the game came 
in the second quarter when An­
dre Orban took the pass down the 
left side and fired the ball past 
the Pitt into the right corner of 
the net.
Pitt-Johnstown appeared to 
have tied the game in the final 
minutes of the first half. A Pitt 
player took a corner kick and drift­
ed it into the CMU goal, but the 
score was nullified because one 
of his teamates accidentally 
touched the ball with his hands.
Tech overwhelmed their op­
ponents by a much wider margin 
than the score indicates. The 
Tartans’ ball control was so ef­
fective in the first and third quar­
ters that Pitt could not take any 
shots on goal. Meanwhile the CMU
booters took an incredible num­
ber of shots (over 20 in the third 
quarter alonel but could not get 
the ball in the net.
Most of the action in the fourth 
quarter was in the Pitt-Johnstown 
territory, but in the final minu­
tes the CMU ball control slacken­
ed somewhat and Pitt put on a
late charge. Their last hope end­
ed when goalie John Lape stopped 
a hard shot by the right wing fro 
twenty yards out.
The Tartan’s tenth and final 
game of the year is this Saturday 
at 10:30 a.m. in the Tech Bowl 
against the University of Pitts­
burgh.

F. Y. Liberal
by Colonel F. W. Jacks, Jr.
U.S. Army (Retired)
I would like to respond to the 
proposal submitted earlier that 
there be a unilateral withdrawal 
now of all troops stationed in Viet­
nam becuase it is important the 
members of the age group most 
likely to do the heavy fighting re­
ceive a response.
First, there is nothing unusual 
in the frustration of young people 
who are vulnerable to military 
service because it is difficult for 
them to recognize the direct 
danger to home, friends, and loved 
ones such as is the case in the 
present situations—before and 
after World War II and during the 
Korean Conflict. It is more evi­
dent now simply because the sit­
uation has existed longer and is 
even more frustrating.
Second, the record of your peers 
who hve gone into military serv­
ice. willingly or unwillingly, has 
been superb. The soldiers today, 
probably think much like a 
¿-section of the readers of 
this, have nevertheless establish­
ed a record of heroism and 
achievement which is unsurpass­
ed in the history of this country. I 
personally do not know any com­
missioned nor any non-commis- 
sioned officer who does not speak 
of Vietnam veterans in the most 
glowing tones. Long hair and all 
—which comes off—there has nev­
er been a better American soldier 
than the one in uniform today.
So it is in the light of these re­
marks that I disagree with the 
proposition that immediate with­
drawal from Vietnam is an accept­
able alternative for the U.S. There 
are three vital drawbacks wrhich 
are based on the premise that any 
such withdrawal is an admission 
of unconditional defeat.
The most obvious effect of ac­
cepting defeat would be the de­
cline of U.S. prestige, world-wide.
So what? One can ask! The an­
swer is that there are now more 
than 40 nations that have mutual 
security pacts with this nation. 
These nations depend on us for 
defense and for the right to have a 
free form of government. But the 
benefits are not all one-sided. 
They offer us bases, the right of 
trade, and they deny the use of 
these assets to our enemies. What 
confidence can these allies have 
in a nation which leaves a battle­
ground on which they stand mili­
tarily victorious?
Likewise, if we admit defeat, 
what deterrence can the U.S. in­
spire to prevent future Vietnams? 
Where do we finally fight? Each 
time we delay, the next one will be 
more difficult, the enemy more 
confident! Where is the boundary 
that we say. "This far and no fur­
ther'? And how do we persuade 
the antogonist that this time we 
mean business?
The second reason we cannot 
accept withdrawal from a rural
undeveloped country is closely al­
lied to the first but is so dangerous 
that it deserves special mention. 
It involves our major nuclear­
armed enemy Russia, and one 
soon to be well armed with nu­
clear might. Communist China. 
Periodically, in the post-war per­
iod. the U.S. has been pushed to 
the wall where the danger to its 
vital interests has been apparent 
to all Americans. Each time we 
have "gone to the brink." the ene­
my has withdrawn. But this power 
of deterrence is based on a com­
bination of capability and determ­
ination. Further, it is not only the 
determination that the nation has. 
but the determination that the 
enemy thinks it has. A miscal­
culation can lead to nuclear war. 
Surely a total withdrawal from 
Vietnam will erode the confidence 
the enemy has in this nation's de­
termination to defend that which 
it considers essential, no matter 
what the cost! If. then, the enemy 
does press to the point where we 
must fight and miscalculate out
determination, nuclear war may 
result when it could have been pre­
vented.
The third reason I believe ad­
mission of defeat in Vietnam is un­
acceptable is the effect that the 
realization of defeat will have on 
our own people and domestic po­
licies. A glance a the history of 
of other defeated nations provides 
the clue to the possibilities. When 
a nation is defeated in war. the 
populace usually demands a 
scapegoat. It may be the form of 
government, a minority group, 
the social system or some other 
unfortunate symbol. But it’s not
pleasant to contemplate! What 
do you think the reaction to undis­
guised defeat, at the hands of a 
small country, not even a tenth of 
its size, would be in this nation 
when realization sinks in after a 
period of. say. 18 months or two 
vears? I don't think I wnat to see 
it!
In sum. my young friends. I am 
sure that, in the end. you will 
make a much better world than 
the imperfect model that my gen­
eration will leave you. But. in the 
interim, I believe you must look 
most carefully at the implications 
of any suggested approach to the 
solution of this difficult war dur­
ing one of the most delicate times 
in our nation’s history and espe­
cially an approach which is incon­
sistent with the judgment of four 
Presidents.
