Nobel-prize-winning econ-
omist and Carnegie Mellon 
alumnus Edward C. Prescott 
gave the inaugural Tepper 
Lecture this past Friday.
The new Tepper Lecture 
series features distinguished 
Ph.D. alumni of the Graduate 
School of Industrial Adminis-
tration (GSIA) — what is now 
known as the Tepper School of 
Business — who were invited 
back to Carnegie Mellon to ad-
dress the community on their 
area of expertise. 
Prescott earned his Ph.D. 
in economics from Carn-
egie Mellon in 1967 and later 
served as a faculty member 
from 1971 to 1980. 
Throughout his career, 
Prescott also taught at the 
University of Pennsylvania, 
the University of Minnesota, 
the University of Chicago, 
and Northwestern University, 
among other schools.
 Prescott is currently the 
W.P. Carey Chair in the depart-
ment of economics at Arizona 
State University as well as a 
senior monetary adviser at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Min-
neapolis. Prescott received the 
Nobel Memorial Prize in Eco-
nomics in 2004 with Finn E. 
Kyland for their contributions 
to dynamic macroeconomics: 
the time consistency of eco-
nomic policy and the driving 
forces behind business cycles. 
Kyland and Prescott onducted 
most of this pioneering re-
search while they were af?li-
ated with Carnegie Mellon.
Upon the announcement 
of the Nobel Prize, former 
University President Jared 
Cohon said in a university 
press release, “I am delighted 
to congratulate Finn and our 
alumnus and former faculty 
member Ed Prescott on behalf 
of the university. They con-
tinue a long tradition of path-
breaking research in econom-
ics at Carnegie Mellon.”
Their papers discussed eco-
nomic problems surrounding 
time-inconsistent policies — 
which cause attempts to stim-
ulate the economy to damage 
it instead — and the effects 
of supply-side factors such as 
technological progress and 
resource shocks on business 
cycles. Prescott also hosted a 
roundtable discussion, which 
was attended by undergradu-
ate economics students and 
focused on Prescott’s experi-
ences in economic research. 
He also touched on different 
theories surrounding current 
macroeconomic events.
In August 2012 Prescott 
was ranked as the 19th most 
in?uential economist in the 
world by the Research Papers 
in Economics project, based 
on his academic contribu-
tions.
According to a University 
of Pennsylvania press release, 
Prescott said, “I love creating 
models and coming up with

Carnegie Mellon is going 
to the Big Apple. By August 
2015, the university will not 
only have campuses in Pitts-
burgh, Silicon Valley, and 
Qatar, but also in New York.
The school contracted 
with New York City, as well 
as Brooklyn-based produc-
tion factory Steiner Studios, 
to create a new graduate 
school campus that melds 
technology with the arts. 
Carnegie Mellon’s Brooklyn 
campus will give students 
the opportunity to obtain 
master’s degrees in subjects 
such as game design, com-
putational data science, and 
emerging media, according 
to the New York Daily News.
The program, entitled 
the Integrative Media Pro-
gram, will cater to gradu-
ate students interested in 
pioneering the converging 
?elds of arts, design, sci-
ence, and the humanities. 
The Integrative Media Pro-
gram is one of a kind; as 
“the ?rst Applied Sciences 
project to integrate rigor-
ous academics seamlessly 
into a specialized commer-
cial working environment,” 
according to a university 
press release, the program 
seeks to contribute to the 
future of technology in ur-
ban environments.
“We believe New York 
City will be the perfect set-
ting for CMU to provide 
education in these technol-
ogy-based modes of expres-
sion and production — so-
cial media, games, special 
effects, responsive envi-
ronments, product design 
and manufacturing — just 
to name a few of the areas 
where we will be working 
together,” said Provost and 
Executive Vice President 
Mark Kamlet in the univer-
sity press release.
“CMU is recognized 
worldwide for its computer 
science and engineering 
programs, but I don’t know 
if many people are aware 
of how strong its ?ne arts 
program is as well,” said se-
nior design major Joe Oak. 
“As the cultural hub, New 
York will be a great place to 
strengthen the university’s 
involvement in the arts as 
well as increase awareness 
among the creative com-
munity.”

The Language Technolo-
gies Institute has recently 
produced several alumni who 
have implemented natural 
language processing and ma-
chine learning applications 
that bene?t both online con-
tent providers and consumers.
Language technologies 
doctoral candidates Richard 
Wang and Frank Lin, along 
with alumni Tarik Raed (SCS 
’11), and Brad Barbin (TSB 
’11) have launched EnFind, 
which is powered by technol-
ogy developed at the Lan-
guage Technologies Institute. 
According to Barbin, EnFind 
is a search engine committed 
to “making the Web a better 
place.”
EnFind, Raed explains, 
“provides readers with an op-
portunity to learn, view re-
lated articles, and make pur-
chases — all from one article 
... and all completely free.”
While perusing the In-
ternet, many consumers are 
easily sidetracked by curiosi-
ties that a particular article 
inspires. Users may leave a 
given site to investigate these 
interests and make purchases 
elsewhere — purchases moti-
vated by the original article. 
Because of this tendency, con-
tent providers are losing out 
on revenue and consumers are 
subject to a more sporadic and 
directionless user experience.
EnFind aims to solve this 
problem, for both the content 
provider and consumer. Raed 
explained, “A content provider 
wants their reader to be en-
gaged in an article — but ulti-
mately monetizes the engage-
ment through recirculation 
and should look to optimize 
this.”
De?ned by its founders as 
a “search engine with no web 
crawler,” EnFind allows read-
ers to enjoy the information of 
the Internet without ever leav-
ing the article of initial inter-
est. In order to properly credit 
initial sites, EnFind places an 
ID on the consumer so that ini-
tial sites can receive “af?liate 
credit” for future purchases.
So far, EnFind has seen 
tremendous success. Cur-
rent data shows a 2 percent 
increase in articles read by 
consumers and 25 percent 
increase in advertisements 
viewed. EnFind’s technology 
has recently been implement-
ed in a trial run for the sports 
section of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette. After the successful 
trial, Raed and Barbin expect 
EnFind to be implemented 
across the Post-Gazette’s site 
by the end of the year.
In light of their recent suc-
cesses, Raed and Barbin re?ect 
on their formative experiences 
at Carnegie Mellon. Both are 
thankful for the inspiring sto-
ries of alumni and the oppor-
tunities to work with Ph.D. 
students during their time as 
undergraduates. In the same 
vein, Raed and Barbin encour-
age undergraduates to chase 
their own unique entrepre-
neurial visions.

Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity recently announced 
the inception of the Simon 
Initiative, a campus-wide 
push for interdisciplinary 
research collaboration and 
technology-aided learning 
initiatives.
The Simon Initiative is 
named after the late profes-
sor Herbert Simon, known 
for his work in cognitive 
psychology and computer 
science, and related appli-
cations in education.
The Simon Initiative is 
complemented by a new 
seed-funding program at 
the university that will 
open up opportunities for 
expansion of education ini-
tiatives. According to an of-
?cial email from President 
Subra Suresh, “The Simon 
Initiative will also coordi-
nate campus-wide activities 
with the Eberly Center for 
Teaching Excellence and 
Educational Innovation, 
the Science of Learning 
Center jointly administered 
with the University of Pitts-
burgh and funded by the 
National Science Founda-
tion, the Carnegie Mellon 
Open Learning Initiative 
activities, and other orga-
nizations on campus to con-
nect research on learning 
with CMU courses and the 
on-campus experiences of 
students and faculty.”
The program looks and 
hopes to combine research, 
technology, and entrepre-
neurship within the univer-
sity, and hopes to unite the 
university’s technological 
and educational worlds to 
help better understand hu-
man learning. The initiative 
will also ensure that high 
quantities of research data 
will be stored so that differ-
ent institutions can utilize 
them. 
The university plans to 
create the Global Learning 
Council (GLC), comprised 
of industrial and academic 
leaders, which will share 
data among various institu-
tions and groups to help cre-
ate a better environment. 
The of?cial website for the 
Simon Initiative states that 
“a data bank consortia will 
collect and store thousands 
of high-quality data sets, ac-
cumulate the best analytic 
methods available, and cre-
ate a large research com-
munity enabled to improve 
education through empiri-
cal research.” 
“This council and the 
Simon Initiative arrive at a 
critical time for educators,” 
President Suresh said in 
the of?cial university press 
release. “The world is ex-
periencing an educational 
revolution, but there has 
not been suf?cient effort to 
date to address the funda-
mental question: Are stu-
dents using these technolo-
gy platforms really learning 
successfully? Carnegie Mel-
lon has been studying how 
people learn with technol-
ogy since the 1950s; work-
ing together with our coun-
cil colleagues, our goal is to 
create guidelines and best 
practices that ensure aca-
demic rigor and successful 
learning for students world-
wide.”
The program has re-
ceived praise from educa-

David Tepper donates $67 million 
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
News Co-Editor
David A. Tepper’s charitable foun-
dation recently gave Carnegie Mellon 
$67 million, the university’s largest-
ever donation from a Carnegie Mel-
lon graduate and the largest gift for a 
building project.
The university will use Tepper’s most 
recent donation to build the new Tep-
per Quadrangle, which will be located 
on the north side of campus, where the 
Morewood Parking lot currently exists. 
Tepper’s previous donation of $55 mil-
lion in 2003 changed the name of the 
Graduate School of Industrial Admin-
istration to the Tepper School of Busi-
ness.
According to the of?cial university 
press release, the four-and-a-half-acre 
Tepper Quadrangle “will be designed 
to facilitate high levels of cross-campus 
collaboration and bring together inter-
disciplinary initiatives, including entre-
preneurship and technology-enhanced 
learning.”
The university’s initial investment 
for the Tepper Quadrangle currently 
stands at $201 million. The ?rst build-
ing on the Tepper Quadrangle will 
house the Tepper School of Business. 
Students in the school of business are 
excited by the prospect of the new 
space.
“I think that it’s a great way for 
Tepper to expand, and keep up its 
reputation as a highly ranked busi-
ness school,” said Elissa Maercklein, 
a sophomore business administration 
student. “The new space will be good 
for Tepper.”
Some students are concerned that 
the new business school building 
planned for the Tepper Quadrangle is 
super?uous. “I don’t know why Tep-
per needs a new building,” said Rachel 
Fowler, another sophomore business 
administration major. “Although it will 
be nice to get a new building.”
Either way, the establishment of the 
new building is far in the future. Dean 
of the Tepper School of Business Robert 
M. Dammon said that the construction 
will not break ground until the summer 
or fall of 2015, and will not be complet-
ed until “optimistically the fall of 2017, 
more likely 2018.”
The university is currently search-
ing for an architectural ?rm to design 
the building; they have contacted over

Vehicle Stop/Theft of 
Chair
Nov. 16, 2013
A University Police of?cer 
stopped a vehicle for a traf?c 
violation on Forbes Avenue. 
While speaking with the 
driver, the of?cer noticed a 
chair in the back of the pickup 
truck. The of?cer con?rmed 
that the chair was removed 
from the cafeteria area in Pos-
ner Hall. The driver was given 
a Carnegie Mellon internal 
discipline citation for theft of 
university property. Univer-
sity Police took custody of the 
chair and will return it to Pos-
ner Hall.
De?ant Trespass Notice
Nov. 16, 2013
University Police made 
contact with a suspicious male 
outside of the Hunt Library. A 
Hunt Library desk attendant 
summoned the University 
Police after the male and two 
others were seen walking 
around the Hunt Library. Uni-
versity Police spoke with one 
of the men and issued him a 
de?ant trespass notice for fre-
quenting Carnegie Mellon’s 
leased or owned property. The 
University Police have posi-
tively identi?ed the other two 
suspicious males that were in 
the library, and all of?cers will 
be on the lookout for the three 
men.
Underage Drinking Party
Nov. 17, 2013
University Police were 
summoned to the third ?oor 
of Hamerschlag House due to 
a loud party. Of?cers discov-
ered several open containers 
of alcohol inside the room 
where the party was held. The 
University Police ordered the 
occupants of the room to dis-
perse and all of the alcoholic 
beverages were disposed of. 
Two students were cited with 
internal discipline citations 
for underage drinking.
On the same night, Univer-
sity Police were summoned to 
the Skibo Café after a report 
of a male student spitting on 
the ?oor of the café. Of?cers 
made contact with the intoxi-
cated student, who was taken 
to his residence by police and 
cited for underage drinking.
Vehicle Damage
Nov. 18, 2013
University Police assisted 
the Pittsburgh Bureau of Po-

Researchers from Carn-
egie Mellon University and 
Temple University recently 
searched for the best strat-
egies for educating teach-
ers, discovering that ?nding 
the best way to teach can be 
extraordinarily dif?cult, as 
there are over 205 trillion 
potential options available 
for professors as they form a 
curriculum. 
Ken Koedinger, professor 
of human-computer interac-
tion at Carnegie Mellon, said 
“There are not just two ways 
to teach, as our education 
debates often seem to indi-
cate.... There are trillions of 
possible ways to teach.”
According to a university 
press release, “In the Nov. 22 
issue of Science the research-
ers break down exactly how 
complicated improving edu-
cation really is when consid-
ering the combination of dif-
ferent dimensions — spacing 
of practice, studying exam-
ples or practicing procedures, 
to name a few — with varia-
tions in ideal dosage and in 
student needs as they learn.”
The researchers then fo-
cused mainly on conclusive 
approaches that they feel 
are vital to classroom learn-
ing. In order to simplify the 
complexity of this matter and 
to help improve educational 
methods, researchers offered 
?ve different suggestions. 
Firstly, “Research should 
focus on how different forms 
of instruction meet different 
functional needs,” imple-
menting more experiments 
“to determine how differ-
ent instructional techniques 
enhance different learning 
functions.” 
Researchers also sug-
gested “[taking] advantage 
of educational technology to 
further understand how peo-
ple learn and which instruc-
tional dimensions can or can-
not be treated independently 
by conducting massive online 
studies,” building “a national 
data infrastructure in which 
data are collected at a mo-
ment-by-moment basis,” and 
developing “more permanent 
school and research partner-
ships to facilitate interaction 
between education, adminis-
tration, and researchers.”
HCI researchers suggest methods to optimize classroom learning
Shared information on social networks can lead to hiring discrimination
Alessandro Acquisti, asso-
ciate professor of information 
and public policy at Heinz 
College, and Christina Fong, 
a senior research student 
at Dietrich College, headed 
a research team that found 
that hiring discrimination 
can result from employees 
sharing information on social 
networks.
Although surveys have 
suggested that some em-
ployers use social networks 
to screen candidates, un-
til now there have been no 
controlled experiments that 
study how often ?rms look 
at prospective employees’ on-
line pro?les, and how much 
those pro?les affect candi-
dates’ chances.
The researchers found 
that a minority of American 
employers consistently refer 
to online searchers for can-
didates. According to Fong, 
“While it appears that a rela-
tively small portion of U.S. 
employers regularly search 
for candidates online, we 
found robust evidence of dis-
crimination among certain 
types of employers.”
According to a university 
press release, “Acquisti and 
Fong used data revealed on-
line by actual members of 
popular social networking 
and job-seeking sites to de-
sign job candidate résumés 
and online pro?les for their 
experiments. They experi-
mentally manipulated per-
sonal traits the candidates 
revealed online regarding 
religion and sexual orienta-
tion, while holding signs of 
professionalism and work 
ethic constant.” They used 
more than 1,000 individuals 
on the Web to test reactions 
to their pro?les and résumés. 
The two  researchers also 
submitted applications for 
subjects to over 4,000 em-
ployers, which helped them 
collect data and investigate 
how many employers looked 
online for candidates.
The researchers stressed 
their ?ndings should be seen 
as correlated — not causal — 
because they could not ran-
domly assign religious values 
and traits in different areas. 
Nonetheless, Acquisti said, 
“Employers’ use of online 
social networking sites to re-
search job candidates raises 
a variety of notable implica-
tions, since a vast number of 
job candidates reveal person-
al information on these sites 
that U.S. employers can’t ask 
in an interview or infer from 
a résumé.”

The Campus Life Commit-
tee is considering putting a 
holiday tree up in the Universi-
ty Center. The proposal raised 
concerns during the meeting 
that a holiday tree could be 
construed as religious bias. Al-
though the tree would not be 
speci?cally a Christmas tree, 
some Senators argued that a 
holiday tree is inherently bi-
ased toward the Christmas 
holiday. The Campus Life com-
mittee is considering the issue 
and possible alternatives.
Student Senate discussed 
the possibility of having col-
lege-speci?c events to foster 
community involvement in 
student government. The idea 
drew trepidation from Sena-
tors after last year’s unsuccess-
ful college-speci?c town hall 
events. Senators suggested 
partnering with academic 
Student Advisory Councils to 
organize the events.
Senate also discussed com-
munication between commit-
tees. Some Senators feel that 
separate committees are too 
closed, and need to present 
committee reports more often. 
Other Senators thought that 
constant committee updates 
would be excessive.

tion experts. “Providing a 
platform that can attract 
world-class talent and sig-
ni?cant public and private 
resources is a critical step for-
ward,” said U.S. Secretary of 
Education Arne Duncan in a 
university press release.
 “Efforts like this new one 
from Carnegie Mellon will 
advance this vital conversa-
tion.”
Since the 1950s, Carn-
egie Mellon has been at the 
vanguard of the movement 
to ?gure out how people are 
able to learn. Studies have 
shown that such practices by 
universities are more effec-
tive than the traditional prac-
tices used by many schools. 
The GLC is already attract-
ing tremendous support, and 
organizations such as Micro-
soft are showing preliminary 
interest. Carnegie Mellon 
students want to learn more 
about the initiative. Hanson 
Zeng, a ?rst-year informa-
tion systems major, said, “I 
think the Simon Initiative 
idea seems great, but getting 
big names into one organiza-
tion may have a façade of real 
accomplishment. But until 
there is action and outcome 
I can’t really say it’s effective, 
considering CMU has been in 
the forefront of tech learning 
since 1950.”
The Simon Initiative 
promises advances in tech-
nology-centered learning 
through the GLC and a new 
source of funding for re-
search and innovation.
20 ?rms and are planning to 
narrow the candidates down 
in the spring semester. After 
an architect is selected, it will 
take between a year and 18 
months to ?nalize a design for 
the building. The building will 
hold more than Posner Hall 
currently does — included in 
the potential designs for the 
building are a new ?tness and 
recreation space, a dining lo-
cation, an auditorium, and a 
welcome center for prospec-
tive students and parents.  
President Suresh wants the 
new auditorium to be the larg-
est on campus, according to 
Dammon.
The building will also 
house campus-wide centers 
for entrepreneurship and col-
laboration, such as the new 
Center for Innovation and En-
trepreneurship, formed from 
a marriage of the School of 
Business’s Donald H. Jones 
Center for Entrepreneurship 
and the School of Computer 
Science’s Project Olympus.
The added ?tness space 
coincides with the university’s 
planned expansion of the Uni-
versity Center, which will gain 
new exercise areas. According 
to Dammon, Tepper stipulated 
that the new building contain 
a ?tness center. “That was one 
of the things that Tepper was 
very concerned about, the 
lack of good ?tness facilities 
here on campus,” Dammon 
said. “So he insisted that if 
he’s going to give us $67 mil-
lion, we have to set aside at 
least 12,000 square feet in the 
new building for ?tness.”
Dammon emphasized that 
none of these plans is concrete 
yet. “Since we haven’t really 
gotten into design yet, there 
may be some things we envi-
sioned having in the building 
that we won’t have space for; 
we may have to move things 
around a bit. But the plan is 
for it to be 295,000 square 
feet.”
The construction of the 
Tepper Quadrangle also raises 
several concerns, since the 
Quadrangle will reduce park-
ing in the Morewood parking 
lot as well as relocate Spring 
Carnival.
“There will be some park-
ing under the building,” Dam-
mon said. “Not enough to 
make up for everything that’s 
going to be lost. They are 
working to ?nd alternatives 
for parking, but they have not 
decided exactly what to do 
yet.”
Dammon mentioned sev-
eral alternatives for parking, 
including a new parking ga-
rage adjacent to the Tepper 
Quadrangle and busing stu-
dents from a parking location 
slightly further away.
Dammon also raised the 
concern of the current dif-
?culty of crossing Forbes 
Avenue, noting that the con-
struction of the Tepper Quad-
rangle is part of a larger uni-
versity initiative to expand the 
Forbes Avenue area. “They 
are ?nding ways of what they 
call ‘taming’ Forbes, making 
sure that the traf?c is slower, 
synchronizing the lights so 
that the cars can get through 
and then there’s a stoppage so 
people can get across,” Dam-
mon said. “The university is 
well aware that they have to 
do something on Forbes Av-
enue. They have to do it in 
consultation with the city, 
obviously — we can’t just do 
whatever we want.”
Spring Carnival, Dammon 
said, will still be in the More-
wood parking lot for — tenta-
tively — the next two years. 
Although a ?nal location for 
Carnival has not yet been de-
cided, Dammon theorizes that 
it will be in the College of Fine 
Arts parking lot and on Tech, 
Frew, and Margaret Morrison 
streets. 
After the construction of 
the Tepper Quadrangle and 
the new business building, the 
building that currently houses 
the Tepper School of Business 
will be reallocated for other 
university departments.
Dammon also emphasized 
that the new building is not 
just for Tepper. “People should 
understand that it’s not just 
for the Tepper School — there 
is going to be signi?cant 
amount of university-wide 
space. We want it to be very 
collaborative; we want it to be

SIMON, from A1
the Brooklyn Navy Yard last 
Wednesday. “Carnegie Mel-
lon is one of the great edu-
cational institutions in the 
country and it just adds to the 
overall intellectual capital of 
the city,” Bloomberg said 
during his speech. “Smart 
people want to be with smart 
people — they feed on each 
other, they develop with each 
other.”
The creation of the Brook-
lyn campus was made pos-
sible by Carnegie Mellon’s 
winnings in the Applied 
Sciences NYC competition, 
which awarded the school 
$100 million and $300 mil-
lion in New York City real es-
tate. The program will open 
in Steiner Studios’ seven-sto-
ry building at 25 Washington 
Ave., following a $65 million 
renovation.
Sophomore mechanical 
engineering major and New 
York native Taisha Vargas 
said, “I think it’s fantastic 
that CMU is reaching out to 
the Big Apple. We need to 
have more of a national pres-
ence, and why not start in the 
capital of the world? CMU 
would be surrounded by sev-
eral other well-respected uni-
versities, and the opportunity 
to present CMU as a univer-
sity that promotes cultural di-
versity through this program 
is groundbreaking.”
“We’re very strong in dra-
ma and the arts, so we have a 
huge alumni base that’s here 
and we’re always involved in 
activities here,” Kamlet said 
in an interview with The New 
York Times. 
“But in terms of yet addi-
tional plans in New York, that 
might be great but there’s not 
others that are concrete at 
this point.”
The Integrative Media 
Program will offer courses 
through the College of Fine 
Arts, the School of Com-
puter Science, the College 
of Engineering, and the Tep-
per School of Business. The 
school plans to have 50 stu-
dents each year — 40 matric-
ulated students and 10 visit-
ing students.
BROOKLYN, from A1
The building will hold more

his and McGrattan’s proposal 
to “move from current U.S. 
retirement system — which 
relies heavily on payroll taxes 
to make lump-sum transfers 
to retirees — to a saving-for-
retirement system that elimi-
nates these payroll taxes and 
old-age transfers.”

Whether it is a crispy piece 
of bacon or an apple pie, ev-
ery piece of cooked food you 
eat has been transformed by 
a varied and complex series of 
chemical reactions.
When a piece of meat hits 
a hot pan or bread rises in 
the oven, a chemical reaction 
involving an amino acid and 
a sugar gives it the browned 
appearance that lets us know 
that it’s cooked. This reaction, 
called the Maillard reaction, 
doesn't just make food look 
cooked — it’s also responsible 
for the ?avor and aroma of 
cooked food.
The Maillard reaction is 
named after the French chem-
ist Louis Camille Maillard, who 
?rst discussed the essence of 
the reaction in his 1912 paper. 
The reaction wasn’t described 
in detail, however, until a 1953 
paper was published by John 
Hodge, a chemist working for 
the U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture. Even today, the complex 
reaction isn’t fully understood 
because of the many variables 
and possible outcomes.
The marriage of high heat, 
amino acids, and sugar is re-
sponsible for the Maillard 
reaction. Although it doesn't 
seem as if foods such as bread 
or meat would have sugar in 
them, even the most savory 
foods have these naturally oc-
curring carbohydrates.
Since the Maillard reac-
tion is so all-encompassing, 
the mechanisms behind it are 
multiplex. In the ?rst stage of 
the reaction, a reducing sugar, 
such a glucose, condenses with 
a compound that contains a 
free amino group, and a chain 
of amino acids that make up a 
protein. From there, the sugar-
amino acid reaction forms the 
Amadori rearrangement prod-
uct, the beginning of a series 
of more complicated organic 
reactions.
The Amadori product re-
acts in different ways to pro-
duce different scents and 
?avors, mostly dependent on 
how acidic the system is. The 
Maillard reaction is notori-
ously complex and dif?cult to 
control; it does, after all, re-
sult in most of the ?avors and 
scents people see and smell in 
cooked foods.
While the Maillard reac-
tion affects a wide variety of 
foods, it is not the only brown-
ing process. Caramelization is 
the browning of sugar, seen 
commonly in roasted marsh-
mallows, crème brûlée, and, 
of course, caramel.
Caramelization is a consid-
erably simpler reaction than 
the Maillard reaction, since it 
involves just heat and sugar. 
Although caramelization oc-
curs at different temperatures 
depending on the type of 
sugar, it generally happens at 
around 338°F.
Caramelization is an exam-
ple of pyrolysis, a decomposi-
tion of organic compounds at 
high heats. Caramelization, 
like the Maillard reaction, is a 
non-enzymatic browning process.
In the ?rst step of cara-
melization, water evaporates 
from the sugar. Next, the sug-
ar starts to break down into 
smaller compounds. Sucrose, 
for example — also known as 
table sugar — breaks down 
into glucose and fructose. 
From here, like in the Mail-
lard reaction, there's a con-
densation process. During 
this step, the individual sugar 
compounds react with one 
another to form hundreds of 
complicated aromatic com-
pounds. These compounds are 
what give caramelized foods 
their signature sweet and nut-
ty taste.
Caramelization can produce 
a wide range of ?avorful com-
pounds. Diacetyl, for example, 
gives food a butterscotch-like 
taste. Other compounds pro-
duced by caramelization in-
clude furans, which have a 
nutty ?avor; esters, which have 
a rum-like ?avor; and maltol, 
which has a toasty ?avor.
As anyone who has acci-
dentally burned sugar knows, 
caramelization can easily go 
too far. If sugar is left to cara-
melize too long, the process 
will break down the original 
sugar to the point where it be-
comes blackened and bitter. 
This is a result of the oxidiza-
tion of the sugar. 
Sugar, a carbohydrate, is 
made up of rings of carbon at-
oms, along with hydrogen and 
oxygen. After sugar is oxidized 
so much that we consider it 
burnt, what’s left over is most-
ly carbon. Blackened, burned 
sugar is akin to briquettes on 
the grill or to chimney soot, 
both of which are made up 
of mostly burnt carbon com-
pounds.
Although food is simple to 
eat, the chemical processes be-
hind producing the ?avors and 
aromas we know and love are 
actually very complex and — 
to this day — not completely 
understood. As researchers 
learn more about the Maillard 
reaction and caramelization, 
it can lead to new ways to ma-
nipulate how processed foods 
look and taste.

Though common sense 
can sometimes seem rare in 
the human population, it is 
almost never associated with 
computers. Carnegie Mellon 
researchers, however, are cur-
rently implementing a pro-
gram that allows a computer 
to label images and acquire 
common sense almost entire-
ly on its own. The program, 
called the Never Ending Im-
age Learner (NEIL) runs con-
stantly on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus and analyzes thou-
sands of images daily. The 
researchers aim to create the 
world’s largest visual data-
base and ultimately improve 
computer vision.
The research team is led 
by Abhinav Gupta, an assis-
tant research professor in the 
department of robotics, and 
includes Xinlei Chen, a Ph.D. 
student in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Language Technologies Insti-
tute, and Abhinav Shrivastava, 
a Ph.D. student in robotics.
Their work builds upon 
already existing programs 
that gather a visual knowl-
edge base, such as ImageNet 
and Visipedia. The issue with 
these programs, the research-
ers explain, is that they sim-
ply rely too much on human 
instruction to cover the vast 
amount of visual data avail-
able on the Internet. The fact 
that NEIL can operate largely 
on its own makes the process 
of building visual knowledge 
bases much more feasible.
Having a computer learn 
visually is far superior to hav-
ing it learn from text alone. 
For example, purely analyzing 
text references might create 
incorrect assumptions about 
objects that would be obvious 
to people who can see. In this 
way, NEIL learns in a similar 
fashion to humans. Babies 
make visual connections long 
before they have the ability to 
read; NEIL works off of the 
same basic principle.
Since the project began 
in July, NEIL has analyzed 
over 5 million pictures. NEIL 
is able to make the common 
sense connections by looking 
through all of these images. 
For example, after looking 
through thousands of pictures 
of wheels and cars, NEIL can 
make the connection in its 
own language that “Car” can 
have a part called a “Wheel.” 
The program has managed to 
make over 3,000 of these con-
nections and categorized ap-
proximately 500,000 objects.
The technical approach 
behind NEIL is complex. The 
researchers started with thou-
sands of “seed images” that 
they gathered from Google 
Images in order to train NEIL 
to recognize patterns. They 
then used a clustering ap-
proach to set up speci?c 
models that NEIL can use for 
future searching. They built 
upon these models to develop 
relationships between ob-
jects. The program works so 
that each time NEIL identi?es 
a new object or relationship, it 
adds to its body of knowledge 
and becomes better at making 
visual connections.
“What we have learned in 
the last 5-10 years of comput-
er vision research is that the 
more data you have, the bet-
ter computer vision becomes,” 
Gupta said in a university 
press release.
The public can follow NEIL 
in real-time through the web-
site www.neil-kb.com. The 
website categorizes NEIL’s 
knowledge base into objects 
such as “1950s_car”, scenes 
such as “Alaska”, and attri-
butes, such as “brown.” As 
NEIL’s analysis becomes in-
creasingly exhaustive, it will 
further develop the capability 
to sub-categorize objects and 
identify deeper relationships 
than those between objects. 
Furthermore, visitors to the 
site are allowed to send a re-
quest or submit a phrase for 
NEIL to look up.
The program isn’t perfect, 
of course. NEIL can make mis-
takes during some searches, 
especially with homonyms. 
For example, the researchers 
mentioned that “Pink” could 
pose a problem as NEIL might 
be confused whether the term 
refers to the pop star or the 
color. Additionally, because 
NEIL runs all day, it is com-
putationally intensive and 
requires over 200 processing 
cores in 2 clusters.
Moving forward, the team 
is excited for NEIL’s potential 
contributions to the ?elds of 
scene classi?cation and object 
classi?cation. They will travel 
to Sydney, Australia in De-
cember to present their cur-
rent ?ndings at the Institute 
of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers (IEEE) Internation-
al Conference on Computer 
Vision.

Last Tuesday, Carnegie 
Mellon University announced 
its creation of the Institute 
for Strategic Analysis (CMU-
ISA). This new organization 
will offer a centralized of?ce 
to coordinate consultations 
with senior U.S. defense, in-
telligence, and diplomatic of-
?cials pursuing science and 
engineering solutions.
Carnegie Mellon has long 
been considered a resource 
to National Security of?cials 
for its expertise in computer 
science, cybersecurity, deci-
sion science, and interna-
tional relations. In addition 
to its reputation for conduct-
ing cutting-edge research in 
areas such as robotics, natu-
ral language processing, and 
human-computer interaction, 
Carnegie Mellon’s history of 
coordinating interdisciplinary 
efforts translates to the uni-
versity’s ability to pragmati-
cally approach complicated 
real-world problems.
Under the leadership of 
Kiron Skinner, the director of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Center for 
International Relations and 
Politics and an associate pro-
fessor of social and decision 
sciences, the CMU-ISA will 
draw from the School of Com-
puter Science, Dietrich Col-
lege of Humanities and Social 
Sciences, and CIT to organize 
lecture series, fellowships, 
and short courses for defense 
and intelligence of?cials seek-
ing expert advice. Before the 
creation of the institute, of-
?cials in need of consultation 
had to depend on their own re-
search and connections to de-
termine who in the university 
to contact. Now, the institute 
formalizes the process and 
optimizes it by serving as a li-
aison — of?cials can contact 
the CMU-ISA and members 
there will pull the resources 
together.
Work in the School of Com-
puter Science and CIT have 
long been tapped for govern-
ment usage.
“Carnegie Mellon isn’t en-
tering into policy debates, but 
providing information on the 
basic science that underlies 
policy and determines what 
is possible and what is not,” 
Skinner emphasized in a uni-
versity press release.
Another important distinc-
tion of the CMU-ISA from the 
university is that it will nei-
ther become a research insti-
tution nor will it administer 
degrees. Like Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Of?ce of Government 
Relations, which works with 
more Congressional leaders 
than National Security ones, 
the CMU-ISA is intended to 
strictly facilitate connections 
between Carnegie Mellon and 
the government.
The institute will not facili-
tate research and will instead 
focus on providing informa-
tion to federal agencies and 
seeking projects from them. 
In addition to describing it-
self as a resource to Congress 
members and their staff, the 
Of?ce of Government Rela-
tions lists among its goals “to 
identify new opportunities 
for the university to engage in 
federally-funded research.”
Federally funded projects 
are common at Carnegie Mel-
lon. According to Carnegie 
Mellon’s 2012-13 Consolidat-
ed Financial Statements, spon-
sored projects are the single 
largest source of operating 
revenue, totaling $406.1 mil-
lion in 2013. The federal gov-
ernment accounts for 86.7 per-
cent of that funding, about 40 
percent of which comes from 
the Department of Defense.

Nov. 18 marked a historic 
day for space exploration. At 
1:28 p.m., NASA launched a 
5,400-pound spacecraft on 
the Mars Atmosphere and 
Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) 
mission from Cape Canaveral 
Air Force Station in Florida, 
according to NASA’s MAVEN 
launch updates website.
Mars, named after the Ro-
man god of war for its distinct 
red color, resides in an orbit 
approximately one and a half 
astronomical units from the 
sun. Home of Olympus Mons, 
the largest known volcano in 
the solar system, as well as 
the famous Valles Marineris 
canyons, Mars has long been a 
favorite among astronomers, 
as well as the planet on which 
the possibility of human habi-
tation seems most probable.
Unfortunately, most stud-
ies of the intriguing planet 
have been done from obser-
vatories on Earth, which, at 
its closest approach to Mars, 
is still millions of miles away. 
According to nineplanets.org, 
the ?rst spacecraft to visit 
Mars was Mariner 4 in 1965. 
Since then, several other mis-
sions to the elusive planet 
have been made. However, 
NASA’s website states that 
the MAVEN spacecraft will 
surpass previous explorations 
to Mars: “[It] will provide 
information about the Red 
Planet’s atmosphere, climate 
history and potential habit-
ability in greater detail than 
ever before.”
According to a NASA press 
release from the day of the 
launch, the MAVEN spacecraft 
separated from an Atlas V 
Centaur rocket’s second stage 
53 minutes after the launch. 
Approximately seven minutes 
later, solar arrays powering 
the spacecraft were deployed, 
and the MAVEN was off on its 
10-month journey to Mars. 
It should arrive at Mars next 
September.
The main goal of the MA-
VEN mission is to understand 
the upper atmosphere of Mars 
— in particular, how the loss 
of atmospheric gas to space 
changed and affected the cli-
mate of the planet. To calcu-
late how much of the Martian 
atmosphere has escaped into 
space, MAVEN will measure 
the current rate of escape and 
gather information to learn 
about the process so that a 
backwards extrapolation can 
be done.
The mission team is com-
prised of a diverse group of 
scientists. MAVEN Project 
Manager David Mitchell is 
from NASA’s Goddard Space 
Flight Center in Greenbelt, 
Md., which manages the proj-
ect and provided two science 
instruments for the mission. 
MAVEN Principal Investigator 
Bruce Jakosky works from the 
Laboratory for Atmospheric 
and Space Physics at the Uni-
versity of Colorado Boulder. 
The Space Sciences Labora-
tory at the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley also provided 
science instruments for the 
mission. NASA’s Jet Propul-
sion Laboratory in Pasadena, 
Calif. is instrumental in navi-
gation support. Lockheed 
Martin built the spacecraft 
and is in charge of mission op-
erations.
“After 10 years of develop-
ing the mission concept and 
then the hardware, it’s incred-
ibly exciting to see MAVEN 
on its way,” Jakosky said in a 
NASA press release. “But the 
real excitement will come in 
10 months, when we go into 
orbit around Mars and can 
start getting the science re-
sults we planned.”

Eating nuts shown to extend life
Studies at the University 
of Toronto have related the 
consumption of nuts with 
longer survival. The research 
was based on two long-term 
studies that investigated the 
health and lifestyle of ap-
proximately 119,000 health 
professionals for 24 to 30 
years. Scientists found that 
people consuming at least 
28 grams of nuts, two to four 
times a week, were 13 per-
cent less likely to die during 
the study. People who ate 
nuts ?ve to six times a week 
were 15 percent less likely 
to die, and those eating nuts 
seven or more times a week 
were 20 percent less likely 
to die. The scientists believe 
that it is too early to say that 
nuts alone will increase lon-
gevity, but they do support 
the idea that nuts are a strong 
part of a healthy diet.

Wearable tech gets battery upgrade
Researchers have dis-
covered that polyester yarn 
can be used to create ?ex-
ible, solar-powered batteries 
that could make wearable 
electronics even more con-
venient. Current wearable 
electronics, such as smart-
watches and Google Glass, 
still involve a charger with 
a cord. Alternatives to this, 
such as textile batteries, are 
expensive and impractical for 
use in wearable electronics. 
Scientists have discovered, 
however, that polyester yarn 
coated with nickel and car-
bon produces a ?exible bat-
tery that can be folded and 
stretched. This material can 
also be combined with light-
weight solar cells, which 
removes the need to plug in 
wearable electronics.

Neanderthal virus found in human
Scientists from the U.K.  
have discovered evidence of 
ancient Neanderthal viruses 
in modern human DNA. They 
compared genetic data from 
fossils to that of current-day 
cancer patients; the results 
suggested that some modern 
viruses could have originat-
ed from diseases present in 
our ancestors over 500,000 
years ago. The team is now 
researching whether these 
viruses, part of the HML2 
family of viruses, are active in 
modern humans. Research-
ers hope that this new discov-
ery will help scientists deter-
mine links between ancient 
viruses and modern diseases 
such as HIV and cancer.

Young galaxies can offer space insight
Using the Atacama Large 
Millimeter Array telescope 
and NASA’s Hubble Space 
Telescope, astronomers have 
discovered three primitive 
galaxies 13 billion light-years 
from Earth. 
These galaxies, which are 
approximately 800 million 
years old, look as though they 
are ready to merge into one 
large galaxy. Astronomers be-
lieve this large galaxy, which 
they are calling Himiko, 
could eventually evolve into 
a galaxy like the Milky Way. 
Astronomers believe that Hi-
miko could provide valuable 
insight on the formation of 
the earliest galaxies in the 
universe.

Diabetes drug could ?ght cancer
Researchers have discov-
ered that metformin, a drug 
currently used to treat diabe-
tes, could be used to treat can-
cer. Clinical trials are already 
underway to determine how 
effectively the drug treats 
various cancers. There are 
many bene?ts to the use of 
metformin as a cancer treat-
ment. Metformin has a strong 
safety record and only mild 
side effects — as indicated 
by its use as a diabetes drug 
— and it’s inexpensive when 
compared with many other 
cancer-?ghting drugs. Met-
formin could potentially treat 
a wide variety of cancers and 
even Parkinson’s.

Volcano found under Antarctica
A group of scientists in-
cluding Doug Wiens, a pro-
fessor of earth and planetary 
science at Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis, has dis-
covered a volcano located a 
kilometer beneath the ice in 
West Antarctica. The scien-
tists used a seismograph array 
to create images of the ice and 
rock in West Antarctica, and 
two unusual seismic events 
prompted a closer investiga-
tion of the area. They con-
cluded that the volcano will 
de?nitely erupt. It will most 
likely not break through the 
ice above it, but could cause 
large-scale melting of ice in 
West Antarctica.

According to the Institute for 
College Access and Success Project 
on Student Debt, college students 
who borrow loans will graduate 
with about $26,600 of debt. Accord-
ing to Gordon Wadsworth, author of 
The College Trap, college tuition has 
increased over 2.5 times the rate of 
in?ation since 1985. Clearly, Amer-
ica has a problem with tuition price 
increases and student debt.
The U.S. is trapped in a student 
loan bubble, which is susceptible to 
burst. Like the housing bubble, it is 
caused by carelessly gifting loans to 
students who won’t graduate and 
will fail to pay them back. This phe-
nomenon was described earlier this 
month by professor Richard Vedder 
of Ohio University at the Students 
For Liberty Pittsburgh Regional 
Conference at Duquesne University. 
Students are taking longer to gradu-
ate, and many are failing to com-
plete their education.
Vedder stated that students are 
being encouraged by many public 
universities to take a ?fth or sixth 
year to receive their bachelor’s de-
gree, and 34 of all students percent 
do so. This prolonged time in college 
increases their debt and raises tu-
ition because of increased demand.
Ironically, as Vedder points out 
in a Bloomberg article, “Elite private 
schools can cost far less relative to 
public schools, not only because of 
the top schools’ generous aid, but 
also because students mostly gradu-
ate in the advertised four years, 
while those at state schools don’t.” 
Many elite universities push stu-
dents to complete degrees in four 
years and deny aid after the initial 
four years. Vedder calculated that 
this push caused a median of 87 per-
cent of students in elite universities 
to graduate in four years, while a 
sad 25 percent graduated in this al-
lotted time in public universities.
This decreasing graduation rate 
and increasing debt can be attribut-
ed to the idea that a person must go 
to college to be successful. This idea 
is far from true. During his speech, 
Vedder stressed, “We have more jan-
itors with bachelor’s degrees than 
chemists with bachelor’s degrees.” 
While this may be hard to believe, 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics re-
vealed that 115,000 janitors, 83,000 
bartenders, and 323,000 restaurant 
servers have bachelor’s degrees.
Student loans have constantly in-
creased the demand for education, 
attracting a large number of people 
who may not be truly suited for col-
lege. After all, academics are not for 
all and, until recently, were seen as 
an option among many others. In 
return, the cost of college educa-
tion has also begun to exponentially 
increase, as those who drop out or 
take additional years make it more 
expensive for others to attend col-
lege and graduate in four years. 
By offering subsidized loans to 
almost anyone and making students 
believe that college is necessary, the 
government may be hurting young 
adults by making college seem like 
an inevitability instead of an option.

Students on The Playwick-
ian, the school newspaper at Ne-
shaminy High School in Langhorne, 
Pa., recently announced that they 
no longer publish the school’s mas-
cot name, which is the Redskins. 
Instead of using the term, the jour-
nalists circumvent it — for example, 
calling the football team the Ne-
shaminy football squad, not the Ne-
shaminy Redskins. In its “Unsigned 
Editorial: Why we won’t publish the 
R-Word” — signed by two-thirds of 
the editorial board — the board de-
scribes the word as “a term of hate.” 
Tension between administrators and 
the board gained national attention 
when administrators told the board 
that it had to use the term.
As a Neshaminy alumnus myself, 
I have only heard the word used to 
foster community for school-wide 
events. However, many members 
of the community rightfully see the 
word as derogatory given its history.
It is admirable that the board 
took a strong stance on the use of 
a controversial word. Furthermore, 
it is understandable that the board 
will not use the term in sections 
like news, based on the opinion of 
the majority. After all, article style 
should be uniform across sections.
By banning the word from all 
parts of the paper, though, the edi-
torial board misunderstood its role 
as a learning publication within the 
high school. The Playwickian is a 
publication that is meant to encour-
age the growth of young writers and 
introduce students to journalism.
The board should have made a 
clear exception for the term’s use 
in editorials. After all, there is a 
clear distinction between individu-
als’ opinions and editorial board’s 
opinions. The board was justi?ed in 
taking the stance that it did against 
the term in articles that express the 
opinion of the entire paper. How-
ever, it is not justi?ed in blanketing 
this stance to individuals’ editorials.
While the editorial board has the 
right to place restrictions on exple-
tives, this speci?c restriction seems 
to place barriers between the board 
and the student body. Students may 
not be receptive to controversial 
rules handed down by the board, 
which may hinder their relationship 
with the paper. They should not feel 
disconnected from a paper that can 
provide a great learning experience.
Especially in a paper in which 
the work of ?rst-time writers is pub-
lished, there should not be a restric-
tive environment over the use of a 
term that has mixed connotations. 
This environment is not healthy for 
fostering a student’s abilities, which 
should be the top priority of the pa-
per. High school is a vital time to de-
velop interests, and the newspaper’s 
hard stance on this term could stop 
some students from exploring an in-
terest in journalism.
When considering the term in in-
dividual editorials, the board should 
allow students to use their own dis-
cretion with the term to promote an 
unrestricted environment for indi-
vidual editorial writers.

How much time do students 
spend in Hunt Library each year? 
Whatever the astronomically high 
number, it’s good to see that library 
staff care about improving the ex-
perience that students have when 
working within the libraries’ walls.
Carnegie Mellon University Li-
braries conducted a survey of stu-
dents this semester, as well as last 
semester. Staff members asked for 
suggestions for improvement of the 
library’s services and availability.
University Libraries recently an-
nounced a long list of notable im-
provements via their website: Hunt 
Library will be open 24 hours a day 
as a trial run starting this Sunday 
through ?nals next semester, and 
plans are underway to improve the 
selection of healthy options at the 
Maggie Murph Café. The library 
website itself has been redesigned, 
and 2,954 new journals have been 
licensed. The library now supports 
BrowZine, which will allow students 
to access scholarly journals and ar-
ticles from their mobile devices. 
University Libraries even listened 
to some of the smallest feedback 
requests, such as installing Google 
Chrome on its computers. Library 
staff also announced that they will 
launch another survey during the 
upcoming spring semester, meaning 
that they will continue to pay atten-
tion to the needs of students.
The initiative taken by the li-
brary’s staff is truly commendable. 
Listening to the desires of students 
is a sign of a responsive and caring 
staff. Beyond the signi?cant advan-
tages for students in doing their 
work, these innovations are also an 
achievement for the university. The 
library actively seeked student feed-
back and implemented that feedback 
in highly visible ways.
Other parts of the university 
community could help students im-
mensely if they took similar mea-
sures with an open willingness to 
change and better ?t what students 
need or want. This sort of proactive 
strategy is exactly what Carnegie 
Mellon should be using in its other 
initiatives.
University Libraries improvements much appreciated
Earlier this month, Carnegie Mel-
lon celebrated the inauguration of 
ninth president Subra Suresh with 
campus-wide festivities. In the con-
text of Carnegie Mellon’s history, the 
beginning of Suresh’s time as presi-
dent is a critical time of transition for 
the university. 
The campus made incredible 
strides over the last few decades, and 
Carnegie Mellon has made itself an 
unquestionable pioneer in research 
and academia. Now, the school has 
an opportunity to focus inward and 
re?ect with the inauguration of Pres-
ident Suresh.
The internal issues that the 
school has are clear to current stu-
dents. There’s a lack of school pride; 
with exams, papers, and problem 
sets around every corner, students 
are often pushed to put their noses to 
the grindstone and forgo the social 
aspects and events that the school 
has to offer.
This tendency also produces 
alumni who don’t necessarily 
look back on the school itself with 
fondness. 
Maybe the best indicator of alum-
ni fondness is their lack of donations. 
According to the Carnegie Mellon 
Alumni & Reunion Giving site, for 
every $1 in endowment funds that 
Carnegie Mellon receives, our peers 
such as the California Institute of 
Technology, the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology, and Stanford 
University receive $7.68, $9.96, and 
$11.50, respectively.
While the university makes a 
strong effort to land students their 
dream jobs, it needs to go further to 
ensure that students are cared for 
while at the university. The univer-
sity initiated efforts to improve the 
campus culture with the series of 
town halls on stress, but those visible 
efforts have disappeared.
Though these overarching prob-
lems exist at Carnegie Mellon, the 
inauguration bene?tted the students 
and faculty in a real way. In addition 
to celebrating Suresh, the inaugura-
tion did something else: It stressed 
the uniqueness and community of 
the school during the ceremony and 
celebrations. Student talent was 
also recognized during the campus 
celebration when they showed off 
their research, work, and service on 
the University Center’s second ?oor. 
These kinds of events should contin-
ue, since they foster a sense of com-
munity that isn’t currently present 
on campus.
But now is time for the school to 
realize the importance of everyone 
here: students, faculty, and staff. 
They are the heart of the univer-
sity — the heart that is in the work 
— and they need to be treated with 
more care.
We can be pioneers in our endeav-
ors and care for our own, simultane-
ously. Let’s make sure that as we ush-
er in President Suresh, the university 
takes this time to put more focus on 
the well-being of students here, be-
cause that more than anything will 
foster pride in the university.
Suresh’s inauguration a way to better campus culture
Braden Kelner/Forum Editor
It’s no secret that Carnegie Mel-
lon has developed a reputation for 
having a culture of stress. As a result, 
many students ?nd the need to seek 
out additional support for their men-
tal health, especially at a high-stress 
time like the approaching ?nals pe-
riod. Carnegie Mellon’s own Coun-
seling and Psychological Services 
(CAPS) has come under scrutiny for 
what some students suggest are inef-
fective methods for scheduling ap-
pointments to see counselors.
In a high-stress campus culture 
like Carnegie Mellon’s, having con-
venient and effective mental health 
support is necessary. CAPS can serve 
this campus better by taking two key 
actions: ?rst, implementing an on-
line scheduling system for schedul-
ing both diagnostic and regular ap-
pointments, and second, reaching 
out to students to get their ideas for 
improving their services.
Academic departments, such as 
the economics, engineering, and 
public policy departments already 
have online scheduling systems in 
place for their advisers. Students 
can visit a webpage and see blocks of 
time available for meetings on their 
advisers’ calendars. By selecting a 
block and entering their Andrew ID, 
students can schedule a time to meet 
and discuss their academic situation. 
The same option should be available 
for students to discuss their men-
tal well-being. The current CAPS 
intake process involves a question-
naire, which the service can easily 
integrate into an online framework 
to make psychological services more 
readily available.
To better gauge campus needs, 
CAPS should implement an easy way 
to collect student thoughts about 
the service, possibly by requesting 
feedback or providing online surveys 
after appointments. A survey is a 
highly visible way for CAPS to show 
the student body that it cares about 
their individual needs. 
Alternatively, CAPS could create 
an anonymous online suggestion box 
to accompany an online scheduling 
system. These initiatives would al-
low CAPS to easily build trust, which 
may not fully exist now, with stu-
dents on campus. CAPS can bene?t 
as an organization and better serve 
the needs of our community by wel-
coming feedback and suggestions 
from students.
Carnegie Mellon must support 
its students by providing convenient 
care to ensure that their mental 
health remains optimal at all times of 
the year. By implementing an online 
scheduling system and reaching out 
for student feedback, CAPS can be-
come a resource to help the campus 
truly thrive.
CAPS must take initiative to gain student feedback

If you’ve read the news recently, 
you’ve probably read about the scare 
over Krokodil. Krokodil, or desomor-
phine, is a drug that ?rst popped up 
in Russia in the early 2000s as a sub-
stitute for heroin, and is known for 
its shocking side effects — it leaves 
the skin scaly and discolored (much 
like a crocodile’s), and in the worst 
cases may eat away the ?esh entirely.
Given its horrifying properties, it 
seems unbelievable that use of this 
drug would spread. However, media 
outlets seem to take it as given that 
the drug is becoming an epidemic. 
One headline by The Huf?ngton Post 
reads “Krokodil Could Be Spreading 
Across U.S.,” and one CBS headline 
warns, “Krokodil use reportedly 
spreading.” Is it really the case that 
Krokodil is an emerging threat to the 
public?
In reality, it is dubious that the 
drug has even reached North Ameri-
can shores. Although the drug is 
known for its necrotizing proper-
ties, infected IV needles may cause 
similar effects, creating a number of 
false positives. One Gawker headline 
reads “Flesh-Eating Drug Krokodil 
is Now Attacking Chicago Suburbs,” 
when the article mentions that only 
three cases have been reported. Sim-
ilarly, headlines have been decrying 
the spread of the drug to places such 
as Ohio, Arizona, and even Canada, 
when, in all of these areas, there are 
less than a handful of cases of the 
drug, none of them actually con-
?rmed by laboratory testing.
Looking a bit more into the issue, 
it becomes clear that the fears of an 
epidemic are entirely unsubstanti-
ated. As an International Business 
Times article states: “Experts have 
said it is unlikely the drug has even 
really left Russia, as it is only used by 
people in remote parts of the country 
where heroin has become too expen-
sive or unavailable — it is turned to 
as a last resort among addicts.” The 
article goes on to further mention 
that there have been no cases of Kro-
kodil con?rmed by the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration laboratory.
The coverage of Krokodil is highly 
reminiscent of the bath salts scare 
from last year. In fact, it is all too 
common for the news media to de-
pict every new drug that pops up as 
an epidemic. Maybe it comes from 
the psychology created by the war 
on drugs: If there is a new drug, it 
is assumed that people, especially 
drug users, are constantly searching 
for a new high and are desperate to 
get their hands on anything to ex-
perience it. This particular case of 
Krokodil may also play to the zombie 
fascination in society; many articles 
describe it as a “zombie” drug.
The media needs to stop hyping 
up cases where a new drug has been 
reportedly used. It is sophomoric 
and highly grating upon the collec-
tive intelligence of the public to cre-
ate a panic every time a few random 
people use a new drug. 
Furthermore, although drug ad-
diction is a serious problem in the 
U.S., this kind of sensationalism dis-
torts the truth of the matter. Intelli-
gent discourse in the media regard-
ing the war on drugs is long due, 
although it may take a while before 
we actually get it.

Retailers are increasingly break-
ing tradition and extending Black 
Friday insanity into Thanksgiv-
ing Day. For the ?rst time, popular 
stores like Toys “R” Us, Best Buy, and 
Macy’s are pushing forward their 
opening times from the early hours 
of Friday morning to the late or even 
early hours of Thursday evening — 
times likely smack in the middle of 
family dinner.
Typically considered the of?cial 
start of the holiday shopping season, 
Black Friday is responsible for at-
tracting hordes of shoppers, aggres-
sively competing for the best deals 
on merchandise. 
Unsurprisingly, it is the busiest 
and most pro?table shopping day 
of the year. Last year, Black Friday 
shoppers spent a combined $59.1 
billion, according to the National 
Retail Federation. It could be con-
sidered a national holiday on its 
own, with its pervasiveness and 
seemingly bizarre traditions.
There are generally two teams 
when it comes to Black Friday. 
First, there are those who embrace 
it — prepared to wait in the cold for 
hours, face the madness, and mara-
thon shop until they drop. Second 
are those who laugh at the ridicu-
lousness of it and shake their heads 
at this prime example of America’s 
consumerism culture. Like it or hate 
it, though, Black Friday has its place.
Retailers have forgotten their 
place, however. They seem to have 
developed an in?ated sense of their 
own importance, or have become so 
hungry for pro?ts that tradition has 
lost meaning. It is ironic enough that 
a holiday centered on being thank-
ful for family and blessings is imme-
diately followed by a day dedicated 
to abandoning family for shops and 
the purchase of everything possible. 
This irony turns to hypocrisy, and 
disrespect, when the former is in-
truded on by the latter.
What right do stores have to 
pull people from their families on 
Thanksgiving? 
Even those who determinedly 
avoid malls on Black Friday and 
swear that they would never resort 
to shopping on Thanksgiving Day 
will likely be impacted by earlier 
start times. If the stores are open, 
people will go, even when that 
means running out on their families 
before the pumpkin pie is served. 
Thanksgiving could be ruined alto-
gether for countless retail workers 
who have no choice over whether or 
not they work. 
Stores have prioritized material-
ism over family values, and custom-
ers may follow suit.
The change in trends has disturb-
ing implications. Though certain 
stores are still holding out against 
the wave of earlier openings, such 
as Costco and Barnes & Noble, it is 
doubtful that they will be able to re-
sist the pressure forever. Increasing-
ly in the minority, these stores will 
lose out on valuable Thanksgiving 
Day pro?ts that their competitors 
are taking advantage of, and will 
eventually be forced to succumb as 
a matter of simple business sense. It 
seems only a matter of time before 
Thanksgiving will become just an-
other shopping day.
Is there anything that can be 
done to stop this trend? Perhaps if 
Black Friday was made an of?cial 
calendar holiday, its events might be 
better con?ned. 
However, sparing more forceful 
action, people should resist the urge 
to snag Thanksgiving Day sales. 
Keep the holiday special — enjoy 
good food, spend time with loved 
ones, and be grateful. The shopping 
can wait until Friday.

The United States Senate elimi-
nated the use of ?libusters for high-
position nominations made by 
presidents this past Thursday. Execu-
tive-of?ce appointments may now be 
approved by a simple majority, rath-
er than by the 60-vote supermajority 
required since 1975. This change in 
legislation means that the majority 
can approve nominations without bi-
partisan support. This ruling will not 
affect Supreme Court nominations, 
or actual legislation.
Democrats — among them ma-
jority leader Senator Harry Reid (D–
Nev.) and President Barack Obama 
— believe that this change in proce-
dure is part of the natural evolution 
of the Senate, and will end the bitter-
ly partisan gridlocks that have domi-
nated nearly every Senate decision 
since President Obama took of?ce. 
Republicans, including minority 
leader Senator Mitch McConnell (R–
Ky.), claim that the Democrats have 
deeply damaged the system of Sen-
ate, and muf?ed the voice of the mi-
nority in politics.
While the limits placed on ?li-
busters have the potential to back-
?re, they are a justi?ed attempt to 
change a system that has sustained 
heavy damage from partisan poli-
tics. The partisan division of politics 
has become an extreme problem in 
U.S. politics, requiring an extreme 
solution.
The limitation of ?libusters comes 
with consequences, the most glaring 
being that the change sets a poten-
tially dangerous precedent. Current-
ly, the law has no effect on legisla-
tion or Supreme Court nominations, 
but that could change. Democrats 
are making a huge gamble that they 
will retain control of the Senate in 
the 2014 election. Even if Demo-
crats maintain their majority in this 
upcoming election, they will lose it 
eventually, as is the way of politics. 
Republican leaders have indicated 
that if they regain the majority in the 
Senate, they could use these changes 
to end the Affordable Care Act with 
a simple majority. The elimination of 
?libusters is not without its problems 
or implications.
However, examining why Demo-
crats felt the need to employ these 
limitations on the use of ?libusters 
is also extremely important. Histori-
cally, ?libuster reforms have been 
implemented after extreme use of 
?libusters. The Senate implemented 
the two-thirds majority rule in 1917, 
in response to repeated ?libusters 
over President Woodrow Wilson's 
preparations for World War I. In 
1919, this rule came into effect and 
ended a ?libuster of the Treaty of 
Versailles. In short, ?libusters were 
created to deal with extremely im-
portant governmental decisions; 
they were created for the big issues.
However, this use has changed 
over time, as evidenced by the Re-
publicans' ?libustering of all of 
President Obama's nominations for 
the Washington, D.C. circuit court 
and other high of?cials. Republi-
cans who ?libustered these positions 
rarely offered a concrete reason as 
to why they disapproved of those 
particular candidates, and appear to 
be ?libustering just to block Demo-
cratic attempts at governance, which 
is a clear abuse of the nature of ?li-
busters. Both parties are guilty of 
misusing ?libusters for political pur-
poses, and the ?libuster has strayed 
far a?eld from its original intention: 
to address massively important is-
sues, not simply gum up the works of 
politics.
Throughout the years since Wil-
son, ?libusters have not been used 
excessively, though their popu-
larity increased during President 
George W. Bush's term. According 
to Mother Jones, during President 
Bush's administration, Democrats 
?libustered 38 of his nominees, or 
roughly ?ve per year. However, that 
number has seen a dramatic increase 
during President Obama's term, with 
an average of 16 nominees ?libus-
tered per year — triple the amount 
we saw with Bush. This is clear indi-
cation that the ?libuster is being used 
to hobble the majority's attempts to 
lead. Filibusters should only be used 
when the minority party has clear 
and deep-seated concerns with a 
particular candidate or issue.
The two most popular opinions 
on the Democrats' decision to limit 
?libusters are these: that the Demo-
crats are making a grab for more 
power — at the expense of the possi-
bilities this precedent creates — and 
that they are trying to work with a 
thoroughly partisan and deeply frac-
tured system. Though this decision 
will certainly have consequences, it 
was a justi?ed attempt to ?x a system 
that has been scarred by partisan 
politics.

A Smart Change of Pace
Men’s basketball cruises in second half to take opener
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Junior Staffwriter
At the start of the season, 
every team is optimistic about 
its chances. There’s a clean 
slate: no wins and no losses.
On Monday’s home open-
er, the men’s basketball team 
gave substance to this opti-
mism with a dominant second 
half, vanquishing Geneva Col-
lege in an 81–67 victory.
The ?rst half, however, 
gave cause for concern. While 
the perimeter defense was 
usually solid, there were plen-
ty of breakdowns that led to 
open three-point attempts. 
The bigger problem was a lack 
of rim protection, as Geneva 
was extremely ef?cient under 
the basket.
This allowed Geneva play-
ers to hang around longer 
than they should have against 
a Carnegie Mellon squad that 
often seemed to have an un-
stoppable offense.
Leading by only one point 
going into the second half 
with a score of 33–32, the Tar-
tans really got going after the 
intermission, hitting shot after 
shot.
An early second-half run, 
spearheaded by shooting from 
?rst-year guard Matt Hillman 
and solid play from senior for-
ward Rob Mohen, separated 
Carnegie Mellon from Geneva 
for good.
Mohen turned in an excel-
lent two-way performance, 
leading the team in scoring 
with 17 points, to go with solid 
defending and rebounding.
However, the real key to 
the victory was a huge hot 
streak from senior guard/for-
ward Christian Manoli, who 
?nished with 17 points and 
eight rebounds.
Manoli was quick to credit 
his teammates. “It wasn’t even 
me,” he said, “It was the team. 
Hillman came out to play; Rob 
Mohen came to play; everyone 
came out to play.”
He acknowledged his slow 
start, saying, “I missed my ?rst 
two threes of the game, but 
a shooter’s got to shoot. You 
just have to come out and you 
can’t get deterred.”
Beyond the three-pointers 
that got the ball rolling for 
Carnegie Mellon in the second 
half, Manoli was effective get-
ting to the hoop, carving up 
the Geneva defense.
On defense, the struggles 
that plagued Carnegie Mel-
lon in the ?rst half were gone 
after the break. While Geneva 
scored more points in the sec-
ond half, this was a result of 
Carnegie Mellon pushing the 
pace.
In the second half, Carne-
gie Mellon forced Geneva into 
nine turnovers and closed out 
the perimeter, leaving Geneva 
with only one three-point at-
tempt. While the offense ran 
the show, the defense allowed 
this game to be blown more 
open than a 14-point margin 
would indicate.
In what can only be de-
scribed as an auspicious start 
to the season, Carnegie Mel-
lon put on a performance they 
could build off of, as they host-
ed the University of Pittsburgh 
at Greensburg on Saturday 
afternoon in an 85–72 victory.

After defeating Geneva College 81–67 in its Monday home opener, the men’s basketball team won Saturday’s game against the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg 85–72. Senior guard 
Christian Manoli (left) averaged 17.5 points and 6.5 rebounds over the two games, while senior guard Asad Meghani (right) averaged 11.5 points.  
Club sports teams ?nd success in their respective ?elds
WILLIAM PARK
Sports Editor
While Carnegie Mellon is 
home to many outstanding 
varsity athletes, many people 
are less aware of the university 
club teams, which are no less 
dedicated or talented.
Here are short recaps of 
how some of the university’s 
club teams have been doing 
so far.
Hockey
After many core players 
graduated, there were doubts 
over how well the club hockey 
team would play this year. 
But with a 6–2 record, the 
team has successfully erased 
those doubts.
Senior right wing Keith 
Hoover is having another 
standout season with nine 
goals and 10 assists.
“I know I’m not the most 
skilled player on the ice so I try 
to make my impact felt in any 
way I can. I think I’ve done a 
good job this year going to the 
front of the net and the other 
dirty areas,” Hoover said.
The future of the team 
looks bright. Sophomore 
center Chad Trice has emerged 
as a consistent scoring threat, 
with nine goals and 12 assists. 
The speedy skater is not just 
a scorer. He also possesses a 
deft passing touch to create 
scoring opportunities for his 
teammates.
“I think the team is off to 
a great start.... We de?nitely 
have the talent to make a play-
off run this year,” Hoover said.
Last year, the team fell to 
California University of Penn-
sylvania in the ?rst round of 
the playoffs. In a test of the 
current team’s form, they beat 
their rivals 8–6 on Oct. 26.
After ?nishing play for the 
semester on Sunday, the club 
hockey team will next hit the 
ice on Jan. 25 against Case 
Western Reserve University.
Baseball
The club baseball team 
ended its fall season with a 
10–4 victory over West Vir-
ginia University on Oct. 27 to 
improve its record to 14–5.
“We have played very well, 
especially recently. We set the 
school record for wins with 14 
thanks to some excellent start-
ing pitching,” senior captain 
Brendan MacNabb said.
Leading the pitching staff 
is junior Darryl Tan, who has 
a 3–0 record with a clean 1.80 
ERA. Meanwhile, sophomore 
Darren Kerfoot has been a 
workhorse, throwing a team-
high 32 innings and 34 strike 
outs.
MacNabb is the team’s 
third starter and has a 1.80 
ERA over 20 innings. 
The offense hasn’t been too 
intimidating, but with strong 
pitching and stellar defense, it 
doesn’t have to be.
Many ?rst-years have 
made strong contributions. 
First-year Dan Evans leads 
the team with a .431 BA and 
seven stolen bases, and ?rst-
year Alex Walenczyk leads 
the team with 20 runs and 
has shown impressive range in 
center?eld.
The team will have a long 
layoff before next playing dur-
ing spring break, when it will 
start its quest for its ?rst play-
off berth in team history.
“For the spring, we have 
a legitimate shot at qualify-
ing for the playoffs ... as long 
as the pitching stays sharp 
and the top of our lineup 
produces,” MacNabb said.
Ultimate
Playing in Division I against 
national powerhouses such as 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
the men’s ultimate club team 
Mr. Yuk has a tough road to 
get to the National Champion-
ships. Losing 14 of its 24 team 
members from last year does 
not make their road any easier.
But with a talented group 
of ?rst-years and strong vet-
eran leadership, Mr. Yuk has 
shown that it can compete 
with the powerhouses in its 
division.
“We’re not here to rebuild, 
we’re here to reload,” junior 
captain Reid Almand said.
Almand and senior Andrew 
Willig, the assistant captain, 
have been instrumental in 
leading the team’s young play-
ers. First-year Justin Abel has 
emerged as a key contributor 
for years to come.
“The freshmen are stepping 
up big time, and I’m really ex-
cited to see this group of guys 
continue to build chemistry 
and carry on the Mr. Yuk tradi-
tion,” Almand said.
Mr. Yuk wrapped up its fall 
preseason in the Steel City 
Showdown tournament on the 
weekend of Nov. 9.
The team lost the ?rst four 
games of the tourney, but then 
regrouped to win its last two 
games against University of 
Pittsburgh’s B team and the 
College of William & Mary.
Soccer
The men’s club team, AC 
Mellon, ?nished its season on 
Nov. 17 with a 10–5–3 record. 
The team just missed out on 
qualifying for the postseason 
tournament, but was named 
an alternate.
“We were disappointed 
not to make it to the regional 
tournament, but we had a very 
positive season nonetheless,” 
junior vice president Gerard 
Kramer said.
Much of their success can 
be attributed to ?nding a 
strong identity.
“In the past, we never re-
ally committed to a playing 
style, but this year we have 
really focused on playing as a 
unit and it has really paid off,” 
senior president Vaughn Rid-
ings said.
The team defeated the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, a team 
they have lost to for the past 
three years, 3–0 toward the 
end of the season.
“In that game our collec-
tive play was outstanding and 
summed up our objectives for 
the season,” Ridings said.
Multiple players stood out 
during the team’s winning 
season. First-year Alex Lucci 
showcased incredible ?nish-
ing ability, leading the team in 
goals. 
Senior center mid?elder 
Alex Zwiren provided great 
stability — the team won ev-
ery game in which he started, 
but he unfortunately missed 
several games with an injury.
On defense, graduate stu-
dent center back Ian McIntyre 
displayed general-like leader-
ship in organizing the back 
line.
The team will play in an in-
door league next semester, but 
is already looking to getting 
redemption next fall.
“Next year, our goal is sim-
ple. We want to qualify for the 
regional tournament,” Kramer 
said.
“It will be dif?cult because 
we have to go through several 
strong teams like Penn State, 
Pitt, and West Virginia, but we 
have gotten good results from 
them in the past,” he said.

CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
One-for-one trades are rare 
in professional sports.
With multiple draft picks 
and role players available, 
teams almost always toss in a 
few ?llers to balance swapped 
players’ salaries and skill lev-
els. This is even truer in base-
ball when teams have access 
to their deep minor league 
system.
That’s why the Texas Rang-
ers’s trade of All-Star second 
baseman Ian Kinsler and $30 
million to the Detroit Tigers 
for ?rst baseman Prince Field-
er was that much more shock-
ing.
For both teams, this 
deal gave up some of their 
strengths in return for help in 
an area of desperate need. The 
Tigers had three power hitting 
?rst basemen/designated hit-
ters in Fielder, 2013 American 
League MVP Miguel Cabrera, 
and former catcher Victor 
Martinez.
When Detroit signed Field-
er back in 2012, Martinez had 
just been knocked out of the 
year with a torn ACL injury, 
and the Tigers still thought 
they were in a position to com-
pete for a World Series. Fielder 
was still available on the free 
agent market and the Tigers 
brought him in to help them 
compete, but at the steep cost 
of a $214 million contract over 
nine years.
Now Martinez is healthy 
and productive again, while 
the Tigers are off to a disap-
pointing loss to the eventual 
champion Boston Red Sox in 
the American League Champi-
onship Series. Cabrera’s de?-
ciencies at third base have be-
come unbearable as he ages, 
and neither he nor Fielder de-
sired to become the full-time 
designated hitter.
Detroit is also about to hit 
a payroll bind when CY Young 
winner Max Scherzer becomes 
a free agent at the end of the 
2014 season and Cabrera’s 
contract expires after 2015.
Detroit’s trade for Kinsler 
?lled two needs. First, payroll 
relief: Kinsler will make $57 
million over the next four sea-
sons, while Fielder will make 
$168 million over the next 
seven years.
Second, Kinsler and De-
troit’s shortstop Jose Iglesias, 
who was acquired in a mid-
season trade with the Red Sox, 
will help turn what was a de-
fensive liability in the in?eld 
into a strength. Cabrera will 
move over to his more natu-
ral position at ?rst base and 
top prospect Nick Castellanos 
will likely be the starting third 
basemen. Castellanos brings a 
lot more range to the hot cor-
ner than Cabrera, along with 
some added speed.
For the Rangers, Fielder 
?lls a massive hole in the mid-
dle of their lineup. After losing 
All-Stars Josh Hamilton and 
Mike Napoli to free agency the 
past two seasons, Texas was 
missing some pop in the mid-
dle of its line-up.
This became apparent once 
slugger Nelson Cruz started 
his 50-game suspension in 
connection with the biogen-
esis performance-enhancing 
drug scandal. Cruz is now a 
free agent and already turned 
down the Rangers’ qualifying 
offer, and there a few power-
hitting free agents available 
who can ?ll the void. With 
Fielder, however, the Rangers 
have a strong left-handed hit-
ter in the middle of the lineup 
to complement third baseman 
Adrian Beltre.
Kinsler’s absence also 
opens up the logjam in the 
middle of the in?eld. With 
shortstop Elvis Andrus sign-
ing an eight year, $120 million 
contract extension at the start 
of the season, top prospect 
Jurickson Profar was stuck 
with no place to play.
Profar played a ?ll-in role 
this past year, split time at 
third base, shortstop, second 
base, left ?eld and designat-
ed hitter. His offensive game 
struggled as a result. He had a 
meager 0.234 batting average 
in 85 games.
The Rangers have no prob-
lem taking on the extra payroll 
with the Rangers’ local televi-
sion contract about to balloon 
in 2015. The Rangers are one 
of the few contending teams 
that are looking to expand 
payroll instead of contract it 
and are likely to add at least 
one or two more big names be-
fore the offseason is over, be it 
through trade or free agency.
This was a perfect ?t for the 
two teams. Each team had an 
excess of talent at premium 
positions and a de?ciency in 
other areas. It’s bold for gen-
eral managers to make these 
moves with large room for 
speculation about their effect 
?ve years down the line. But 
the Tigers and Rangers want 
to win and have now shown 
the league that they will do 
anything necessary to do so.
SPORTS COMMENTARY
Fielder-Kinsler trade works perfectly for Detroit and Texas
Newby and Schnepf race for CMU in NCAA Championships
SHANA SINGH
Junior Staffwriter
Senior Josh Newby and 
sophomore Rekha Schnepf 
took on the 2013 NCAA Divi-
sion III Cross Country Cham-
pionships this past Saturday at 
Hanover College.
This was Newby’s second 
appearance at the national 
level of competition, his ?rst 
being with the team last fall. 
Schnepf grazed the NCAA 
course for the ?rst time and 
is the ?rst woman to compete 
in the NCAA Championship 
for the Tartans since the 2011 
season.
Josh Newby ran a great 
race, placing 53rd in the na-
tion and ?fth in the confer-
ence with a time of 25:35.
Newby started the ?rst two 
miles of the race pretty con-
servatively, and then spent the 
next three miles quickening 
his pace and making up a lot 
of ground. 
There were 275 men com-
peting in the race, leaving run-
ners “jostling and elbows and 
spikes ?ying around on the 
turns,” Newby said.
The Palo Alto native has 
been running since his fresh-
man year of high school, 
which is when his training for 
Saturday’s NCAA Champion-
ships began.
“Your ?tness multiplies and 
grows over time, so you can’t 
just reach maximal ?tness in 
just one season.… It is literally 
an eight year process,” he said.
The senior can’t imagine 
his life without running: “The 
discipline it has taught me and 
the fact that I’ve worked to-
wards the goal of becoming a 
better runner pretty much for 
two hours every day for eight 
years; I have to imagine that 
has made me more disciplined 
in other parts of my life.”
For Newby, running is a 
battle against the mind. “It’s 
a release. Your body reverts to 
muscle memory and you zone 
out; you’re not worried about 
what’s going on in your classes 
or your social life,” he said.
Looking back at his col-
legiate career, Newby’s fa-
vorite memory was making 
the NCAA Championship as 
a team last year. “It was most 
bene?cial bonding experience 
the team has had because we 
worked together toward the 
goal for the entire season and 
it paid off,” he said.
As a ?rst-year, Newby 
looked up to the seniors in 
awe. 
Being a senior now, it’s 
hard for him to believe that he 
is now the role model for the 
underclassmen.
“If I knew as a freshman 
that I would end up going to 
NCAA’s individually my senior 
year, I would have been pretty 
amazed,” he said.
In the future, Newby plans 
on training for marathons; the 
longest race he has run up to 
date is a half marathon. “It’s 
a completely different beast,” 
Newby claims, “it’s a mental 
battle way more than a physi-
cal one.”
As Newby ends his career 
on a high note, Schnepf is 
making leaps and bounds as a 
sophomore.
On Saturday, Schnepf ?n-
ished the 6k course with a 
time of 23:17, placing 189th 
out of 280 competitors.
Although her time was not 
a season best, the race was a 
great learning experience for 
her.
Schnepf started running 
several years before high 
school because her father was 
a runner in college. 
While training for races, 
Schnepf puts her best foot 
forward though is constantly 
worried about getting injured. 
“Because then you can’t run 
and you can’t get any better,” 
she said. Luckily, the sopho-
more had an injury-free spring 
and summer, setting a solid 
foundation for her great sea-
son.
The thought of qualify-
ing individually hadn’t even 
crossed Schnepf’s mind. “I 
thought as a team we had a 
really good chance of making 
it together, but there are so 
many moving parts that you 
can never really predict that,” 
she said.
“I wasn’t even sure that I 
had made it to regionals, let 
alone nationals,” Schnepf 
said. “I don’t want to get my 
hopes up and end up being 
disappointed.”
After her success this sea-
son, Schnepf is destined to be 
a team captain, but she is go-
ing to wait her turn. “I think 
we have some really great up-
perclassmen that deserve to 
be captain next year,” Schnepf 
said. 
She is excited about the 
fresh talent on the team: 
“They should know they have 
a lot of potential.”
As Newby ends his career 
on a high note, Schnepf rep-
resents the future of the wom-
en’s cross country team.

Shearwater disappoints
Indie rock band’s newest release is poorly timed
Indie rock band Shearwater had finally made a name 
for itself with its previous three albums. 2008’s Rook 
got the artsy, nature-themed band some critical 
acclaim; The Golden Archipelago built on that 
success and expanded the band’s instrumental and 
color palates; and last year’s Animal Joy was the 
most commercially successful. The album freed up 
the band’s primitive and primal sensibilities with its 
Andrew-Bird-meets-Bruce-Springsteen feel.
The three albums contain some of the best indie 
music produced in the past decade — lead singer 
Jonathan Meiburg’s voice makes Bon Iver sound like 
a whining schoolboy — but Shearwater hasn’t yet 
done anything to put its name on the map. Meiburg 
and his cohorts are still working on a new solo 
album to build on their triumphs.
In the meantime, we get Fellow Travelers, a cover 
album that does little good for the band. If anything, 
it ensures that Shearwater’s next album won’t 
receive as much attention as it should.
Granted, the album’s theme has merit. The band 
covered songs by current influences instead of older 
ones: Each song on the album belongs to a group 
Shearwater toured with. Meiburg’s arrangements 
scream forgettable, however, and so do the songs 
the band chose to cover.
Fellow Travelers starts out strong, with the closest 
Shearwater’s ever come to a rock anthem: Xiu Xiu’s 
“I Luv The Valley OH!!” Meiburg channels his inner 
Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age, but 
it’s nowhere near as thrilling or well paced as any 
upbeat track from Animal Joy.
St. Vincent’s “Cheerleader” wins the award for worst 
song choice. She has dozens of songs that would be 
better fit for Shearwater’s aesthetic, but instead they 
took one of her most well-known tunes and took it 
too close to the country genre for comfort.
“F****d Up Life” is another subpar track, and offers 
an odd experience. Hearing the f-bomb repeatedly 
fall out of Meiburg’s magnificent mouth is like 
eating pudding from a bowl lined with garlic salt. 
It’s distasteful and unnatural. The band’s sound is 
often so pure that expletives sully them, making 
them seem cheap.
This isn’t to say that Fellow Travelers doesn’t 
have good songs — David Thomas Broughton’s 
“Ambiguity” is the simplest, most introspective, 
and most effective on the album. A repeating chord 
progression in the harp and a fairly static synth pad 
are all Meiburg needs to float and toy with lines like, 
“Such selfishnesses trivialize any tenderness/As the 
coffee commands the torture of my bowels.”
The drum and bass on a few of the tracks — “F****d 
Up Life” in particular — may not be processed, 
but it sure sounds like it. Even for a cover album, 
this departure from what the band is good at — 
especially while they’re still developing that sound 
— doesn’t seem like a great idea.
Shearwater’s main appeal lies in its excessively 
organic sound. Every song is like a journey through 
a different expanse of wilderness: a mad rush 
through the deep forest (“You As You Were,” Animal 
Joy), a trek over glacial peaks (“The Snow Leopard,” 
Rook), or a passage through the Strait of Magellan 
(“Castaways,” The Golden Archipelago). Without 
the visual and poetic appeal of its own music, all 
Shearwater has to offer is a pretty voice.
Shearwater would have been better off storing 
Fellow Travelers away until its next solo album was 
finished. This throwaway LP ruins the momentum 
it had carefully built up over the past decade; 
hopefully, the band’s next venture can put it back on 
track.

Advice for awkward people
Hey Ryan and Matt,
I was bolting to the printer 
in Baker yesterday so I 
could turn in my paper for 
my next class when I saw 
this student hanging out 
in front of the printer just 
losing it. There was about 
a book and a half’s worth 
of printed pages in the 
tray, and tears were just 
streaming down her face. 
I felt sorry for her but I 
didn’t want to intrude; 
I just wanted to get my 
paper and get to class. 
Am I a bad person for not 
showing some kind of 
caring or concern?
Printing Reaction Is Not 
Totally Qool, Unusually 
Odious Tryst Arises
Dear PRINT QUOTA,
We recommend against 
worrying about the printers 
too much; they take all kinds 
of abuse throughout the 
semester. Matt has been 
known to shout obscenities 
and kick the printers. 
Besides, Carnegie Mellon 
gives students $40 worth 
of print quota; the printers 
should be designed to 
handle that kind of abuse. 
As for the person crying in 
front of the printer, she’s 
probably printing off all 
of Blackboard ahead of 
Thanksgiving break so she 
can get a jump on studying 
for ?nals. We all do it at one 
point in the semester, mostly 
to use up that $40 of printing 
allotment. We’re sure she 
broke down because it ?nally 
occurred to her how much 
she needs to study for ?nals.
Or maybe she just feels 
guilty for printing one-
sided pages,
Matt & Ryan
Matt and Ryan,
I’m heading home this 
Tuesday for Thanksgiving 
and I was wondering 
if you have any travel 
advice for me. I want to 
make sure I make it home

Dear SO VERY TIRED,
Well, since you didn’t 
mention how you’re getting 
home, we’ll have to cover all 
methods of transport. 
A general rule of thumb is to 
leave earlier than you think 
you need to. Whether you’re 
driving, ?ying, or taking a bus 
or train, you should get out 
the door sooner than you 
think you need to. Especially 
the week of Thanksgiving. 
Again, especially the week 
of Thanksgiving. You know 
who is going to be on the 
road? Everyone else in the 
United States. Your peers, 
your teachers, your RAs, 
and everyone else will be 
conducting a mass exodus 
from campus starting around 
noon on Tuesday. You will 
be but a speck in an ocean 
of people who want to get 
home just as much as you 
do. The line at the bus stop 
at Forbes and Morewood 
Avenues is ridiculous. Spend 
the night there if you have to.
Good luck. You’ll need it,
Ryan & Matt

Warning: This article contains spoilers for The Day of the 
Doctor.
Fifty years of traveling through time and space 
culminated in a celebration last Saturday for the man 
known only as the Doctor.
The British television classic Doctor Who celebrated its 
golden anniversary with a week of interviews, behind-
the-scenes specials, a TV movie, and a Google doodle, all 
leading up to the 50th-anniversary special The Day of the 
Doctor in the world’s largest simulcast of a TV drama.
The special saw the convergence of three regenerations 
of the Doctor: the current 11th (Matt Smith), the 10th 
(David Tennant), and the newly discovered “lost” 
regeneration (John Hurt). They join together to stop the 
Zygons, a shape-shifting alien race from the show’s 
past, as they try to invade Earth to replace their home 
planet, which was destroyed at the very beginning of the 
legendary Time War.
The Zygon invasion is only the secondary plot, however, 
as Hurt’s lost Doctor must face the choice that forever 
changes the man he will come to be. He must choose 
to either use the catastrophic device known as The 
Moment, destroying his race and ending the Time War, 
or allow the war to continue ravaging the universe.
The Moment has a mind of its own, as it made itself 
known in the form of former companion Rose Tyler (Billie 
Piper), also known as the Bad Wolf. She facilitates the 
reunion of Doctor regenerations to show what the man 
will become because of the choice he makes.
Filled with throwbacks to the very beginning of the 
show, the episode perfectly encapsulates what makes 
Doctor Who so timeless. There are moments of humor, 
especially interactions betwen the Doctors, and 
moments of poignancy, as the elder regenerations re?ect 
on the horrifying decision the Doctor had made 400 
years before.
Among the familiar faces present in the episode, Hurt 
stands out. His characterization of the Doctor as a 
crotchety old man is the perfect foil to the childlike 
natures of his later selves. The only disappointment is 
that this episode is all we have of the War Doctor, as he 
was called in the minisode prequel released earlier last 
week.
In the end, all three Doctors — with a push from 
impossible current companion Clara Oswald (Jenna 
Coleman) — choose not to change history: Together 
they have the time and power to save their home planet 
of Gallifrey and all its inhabitants, which forces their 
enemy, the Daleks, to destroy themselves by accident.
All 13 incarnations of the Doctor work together to freeze 
Gallifrey in a moment of time using Timelord technology. 
The result is something that looks like a 3-D painting, 
which ends up in London’s National Gallery.
The sequence showing the Doctors working together to 
save Gallifrey includes some major surprises, as quick 
shots of the ninth (Christopher Eccleston) and newly 
announced 12th (Peter Capaldi) indicate that every 
single incarnation of the Doctor is in attendance.
Compared to the narrative mess that was seasons ?ve 
and six, showrunner Steven Moffat creates a story that 
feels complete, while still setting up for the future. The 
episode is ?lled with the essence of what Doctor Who 
is, but it’s the ?nal minutes that just about sum up the 
storied history of the show and give it a push toward the 
future. Fifth Doctor Tom Baker makes the ?nal surprise, 
showing up as the curator of the National Gallery and 
urging the 11th Doctor to search for Gallifrey.
The ?nal shot shows all versions of the Doctor standing 
together, punctuating the episode with the memory 
of those lost and hinting at future excitement. It’s a 
beautiful ending to the celebration of a show infused 
with hope that has inspired the world for 50 years and 
will surely continue to do so for many more to come.

Craft fair promotes homespun holiday gifts
Pittsburgh-based I Made It! Market provides exposure for local businesses and artists
With the holiday shopping season just around the corner, 
a bubbling craft market set up shop Friday and Saturday 
afternoon in the Waterfront’s shopping district.
Eighty artists, crafters, and designers ?lled two vacant 
retail storefronts with beautiful jewelry, pottery, all-
natural soaps and scents, cozy knitted hats, original 
artwork and prints, adorable baby clothes, toys, and 
everything in between. The event drew a large crowd 
of eager shoppers, many of them families with babies in 
tow, to ?nd special gifts for loved ones — and to try to 
resist buying too much for themselves.
Ensuring that nobody went hungry, My Goodies Bakery 
enticed shoppers with vegan and gluten-free baked 
goods, a stop by Aunt Carol’s Gourmet Dips allowed for 
plenty samples of tasty dips, and The Sweet Spot came 
equipped with chocolate to make everything better.
A number of artisans had Pittsburgh-speci?c products, 
such as Chuck Beard’s “Abandoned Pittsburgh” 
photography focusing on old mills and buildings, Carol 
Skingers’s prints and tiles of a map of Schenley Park, and 
city-inspired T-shirts by Steel City Cotton Works.
The pop-up craft event was organized by I Made It! 
Market (IMI), a Pittsburgh-based indie-craft marketplace. 
Self-described as “a fantastical, nomadic, pop up 
handmade shopping place,” IMI’s main mission is to 
create opportunities for Pittsburgh’s artisan community 
to sell its wares to the public. In the process, the 
organization aims to create a more cohesive community 
of crafters that mobilizes to create real change in 
Pittsburgh through craft.
I Made It! Market is organized largely by business 
development and communications guru Carrie Nardini, 
as well as Carnegie Mellon alumna Nina Marie Barbuto 
(CFA ’06), who co-founded IMI with Nardini back in 
2006. Nardini, who holds a master’s in business and a 
B.A. in English from the University of Pittsburgh, saw 
a need for business development resources for the 
increasing number of Pittsburgh artisans and crafters.
The movement toward self-sustaining local economies 
rather than multinational businesses is not a new 
one, but it has gained support and fresh energy in the 
last decade with a renewed national focus on local 
businesses and the emergence of e-commerce 
sites such as Etsy, an online craft marketplace that 
facilitates a direct customer-artist relationship. Although 
there is growing interest in handmade works, small 
businesses and artisans still have extreme dif?culty 
competing in the mainstream marketplace in large part 
because they can’t compete against mass-produced 
price de?ation. In addition, many one-man businesses 
have limited resources to market themselves to a large 
audience.
IMI allows businesses to get around these obstacles by 
effectively doing the media, publicity, and organizational 
aspects of putting on an event to draw shoppers. As a 
result, a growing movement of entrepreneurial artists 
and crafters has quietly developed into a uniquely well-
organized community in Pittsburgh. 
Crucial to the market’s success has been its collaborative 
attitude in building relationships with other nonpro?ts 
in Pittsburgh — such as the Three Rivers Arts Festival, 
The Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh, Cotton Factory, 
and Southside Works — which allows IMI to connect 
with the Pittsburgh community and draw in a wider net 
of customers. In addition to putting on craft shows, IMI 
works with small creative businesses that need help 
marketing their ideas, making websites, and promoting 
themselves. IMI also collaborates with groups interested 
in hosting their own craft fairs by bringing in artists 
and organizing the events. Workshops are available for 
people of all ages.
With the madness of Black Friday just around the 
corner, a focus on buying local handmade gifts this 
year is refreshing. In a society too often overcome by 
cheap trends, craft shows remind us of the innate value 
of a product made with care. The artisan quality, the 
thought that goes into every last detail, and the personal 
connection you can get when buying a handmade item 
is worth the extra few dollars.
If you’re interested in learning more about I Made It! 
Market, check out its website at imadeitmarket.com and 
come out to the next craft fair on Dec. 15, “Last Minute 
Shopping at The Boyd Community Center.”

Imagine seeing the entire saga of Harry Potter in a 
hilarious, 70-minute performance with only two actors. 
It sounds impossible without Hermione’s Time-Turner. 
However, the muggle production Potted Potter — The 
Unauthorized Harry Experience — A Parody by Dan and 
Jeff, which played at Pittsburgh’s Byham Theater from 
last Wednesday to Sunday, did just that.
Writers Daniel Clarkson and Jeff Turner originally came 
up with the idea for the show in 2005 when they were 
asked to create a performance to entertain the crowds 
of eager fans awaiting the midnight release of the sixth 
book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood 
Prince. Clarkson and Turner’s show related the ?rst ?ve 
books in ?ve minutes. A year later, the show grew to an 
hour in length, and eventually included all seven books 
in the performance henceforth known as Potted Potter.
Delme Thomas, who plays every character in the 
show except for Harry (and even puts on the glasses 
occasionally), said the show has been an unexpected 
turn for him. After his agent found the audition, he said, 
“I auditioned for the piece and I actually didn’t think I 
was going to get it.”
Thomas has been a Harry Potter fan since he picked 
up the ?rst book shortly after the ?rst two had been 
released. “It was the only book in the shop that looked 
fairly interesting and I got hooked on it from that,” 
he said. Now not only an avid fan and a Huf?epuff 
according to Pottermore.com’s of?cial test, Thomas  
shifts roles from Hermione Granger to Professor Snape to 
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
“It’s always fun to play the baddies,” Thomas said. “The 
goodies are rubbish.” He has been playing both types 
of roles in eight weekly shows every week since March 
when he started the tour in London.
“The good thing about the show,” Thomas said, “is it’s 
a comedy improv show, so you take what you get and 
roll with it.” According to him, 70 percent of the show is 
scripted. Thomas and his counterpart, James Percy (who 
plays Harry for the majority of the show), improvise the 
other 30 percent.
The two make an excellent pair onstage. Thomas’s 
contagious enthusiasm and physical humor are balanced 
out by Percy’s dry wit and adherence to the story line. 
Percy moves the story along while Thomas keeps the 
audience engaged, constantly eliciting applause, cheers, 
chants, and jeers throughout the show.
The improvised parts were easy to identify as unscripted 
because they occasionally even sent the actors into 
?ts of laughter. “We usually try to make each other 
laugh as much as possible,” Thomas said. “We’re very 
professional. It’s the classic two-man comedy.”
Thomas said the most fun part of the show for him was 
when he engaged the audience in a game of Quidditch. 
“It’s my moment where I really interact with the 
audience,” he said.
This version of Quidditch requires less ?ying on brooms 
and avoiding bludgers, however, and more bouncing a 
beach ball between audience members and trying to get 
it through a lit up hoop while two children (volunteers 
from the audience) chase the “golden snitch” (Percy 
in a ridiculous costume) around the stage. It was quite 
a sight to see grown adults laughing, cheering, and 
chanting “Gryf?ndor” or “Slytherin” while whacking a 
beach ball across an auditorium.
Overall, Potted Potter was a magical experience that 
muggles, squibs, wizards, witches, members of the 
Order, and Death Eaters alike could enjoy together. For 
more information, visit www.pottedpotter.com.

The holiday season is fast approaching, with 
Thanksgiving this week and winter break just around 
the corner. We’re all ready for some time away from 
problem sets and papers — but as wonderful as it 
sounds, you can’t spend the entire break sleeping. 
So give your mind a break and treat yourself to one of 
technology’s greatest gifts: the TV marathon binge.
But what should you watch? Luckily, I spent the 
semester staying caught up, just so you can reap the 
bene?ts. Check out some of these shows to beat your 
winter blues.
 
American Horror Story: Coven 
FX
The third season of this show is all about witches. New 
Orleans sets a luscious cultural backdrop to a story full 
of witchy teenagers, immortality, and the struggles of 
life and power. While this installment isn’t as overtly 
frightening as the ?rst two, it has that spooky tension 
that arises when things go bump in the night. While 
you’re at it, go ahead and watch or rewatch the ?rst two 
seasons, because why not?
 
Pretty Little Liars 
ABC Family
What better way to relax than by torturing your mind 
with crazy plot twists and turns, only some of which 
could have been thoroughly thought out? Pretty Little 
Liars is the perfect combination of a crazy murder 
mystery and vapid teenage show, the likes of which can 
only be found on ABC Family. Since the show comes 
back in January, why not get caught up now while 
you’ve actually got the time? 
 
Sherlock 
PBS
If you haven’t seen all six episodes of this modern-
day TV adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, you’re doing 
something wrong. Each episode clocks in at about 90 
minutes, making it perfect TV fare for a night in from the 
cold weather (or the sunny California weather, if you’re 
one of those people). The highly anticipated third season 
makes its stateside debut in January, so start watching 
now and throw your theories about the show’s return 
into the ring. If you’re really into Holmes adaptations, 
also check out CBS’s Elementary. Gender-swapped 
Watson is a true gift to television and its Holmes/Watson 
relationship is one of the sassiest around.
Parenthood 
NBC
If you want a show that will leave you an ugly sobbing 
mess at the end of almost every episode, then check out 
this family drama. So much happens every season, it’s 
almost like Degrassi for adults. Seriously, if you don’t cry 
at least three times per season, you might be an actual 
robot. Plus, it’s currently in its ?fth season, so there’s 
plenty to binge on.
Reign 
The CW
Don’t be upset if you start Reign expecting a show that’s 
accountable to reality or that features less-than-stunning 
people; it’s on The CW, so clearly you’d be out of luck. 
But if you can look past glaring historical inaccuracies 
and frankly ridiculous love triangles, Reign is the kind 
of brainless, beautiful fun that’s been missing on TV 
since Gossip Girl ended. Beware, though: Reign only 
just started its ?rst season in October, so you might get 
crazily addicted and then run out of episodes to watch.
Scandal
ABC
If you think of binging as watching one, maybe two 
episodes at a time, then a) you’re doing it wrong; and b) 
you don’t watch Scandal. There’s a twist in just about 
every episode, which makes it supremely addictive. If 
you can stand to watch fewer than ?ve episodes in one 
sitting then you deserve an award. This season has 
been especially juicy and makes all the drama of the 
?rst two seem like child’s play. If you ?nish Scandal and 
are looking for more of that presidential/political drama, 
check out The West Wing. It’s an oldie, but a goodie.
Parks and Recreation 
NBC
The ?rst season is kind of rough, but Parks and Rec hit 
its stride in the second season and is now one of the 
best comedies on TV. Amy Poehler is entertaining as 
Leslie Knope, but the motley crew from Pawnee, Ind., is 
what really makes this show comedy gold. Who would 
have thought that the ins and outs of a small-town parks 
and recreation department could be so much fun? NBC 
excels at creating strong ensemble casts, so check out 
Poehler’s partner-in-crime Tina Fey in 30 Rock or Steve 
Carell in The Of?ce for more workplace fun.
Veronica Mars
The CW
Veronica Mars is a modern-day Nancy Drew, kicking 
butt and taking names as she works to solve her best 
friend’s murder and various small-time crimes in her 
hometown of Neptune, Calif., even while she navigates 
the shark-infested waters of dating the 1 percent. She’s 
exactly who you wish you were deep down inside. 
You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll cheer on Veronica as 
she does her thing as basically the coolest person ever. 
Watch all three seasons and then get ready for the fan-
funded movie, coming next spring.
Broadchurch 
BBC America
This is the most serious binge-watch suggestion. 
Broadchurch started airing right at the beginning of 
the semester, so you might have missed it. The eight-
episode ?rst season follows an investigation into the 
murder of a young boy in a small, rural town in England. 
It gets pretty heavy at times and is incredibly emotional, 
so keep the tissues handy. Well acted and powerful, 
Broadchurch is something you do not want to miss. If 
you’re into BBC America and want something a little less 
emotionally charged, Orphan Black was the standout hit 
from the network this year, and both shows have been 
renewed for a second season.

The seventh annual Bhangra in the Burgh (BIB) 
competition was held at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial 
Hall last Saturday night. Although only seven years old, 
BIB has consistently brought together some of the best 
Bhangra teams in the North America and has sold out 
multiple shows.
“It was obviously a really fun show,” said Pranita 
Ramakrishnan, sophomore information systems major 
and BIB co-chair. Aside from the ?ashy dancing, 
however, the co-chairs were all most excited about 
getting the community involved in and excited about 
Bhangra, a dance style for which they all share passion.
This year’s competition differed from previous ones 
in that it was promoted accessibly all over campus. 
“Before the show we tried to make the PR really fun,” 
Ramakrishnan said. Anyone who walked past Doherty 
Hall the weeks preceding the show can attest to the 
energetic music that blasted while committee members 
sold tickets for both the event and the after-party.
This year, the committee also welcomed Indian emcee 
Jus Reign, a famous Punjabi comedian and YouTube 
sensation. As host for the show, Jus Reign kept the fun 
alive between sets as he held “impromptu” Skype video 
calls with his brother and joked about the lack of white 
people in the audience.
On Saturday, Pittsburgh welcomed eight competitive 
teams: the University of California, Berkeley’s Bhangra 
team (Cal Bhangra), Columbia University’s Bhangra team 
(Columbia Bhangra), Cornell University’s Bhangra team 
(Cornell Bhangra), First Class Bhangra (FCB), George 
Mason University’s Bhangra team (GMU Bhangra), 
Shaan Mutiyaaran Di Bhangra Club, the University 
of Virgina’s Di Shaan, and Virginia Commonwealth 
University’s Bhangra team (VCU Bhangra). Also 
featured were ?ve local exhibition acts: Carnegie 
Mellon University’s Chak de Bhangra, the University of 
Pennsylvania’s Penn Masti, the University of Pittsburgh’s 
PantheRaas, Carnegie Mellon’s Deewane, and Carnegie 
Mellon’s Soulstylz.
Maintaining its roots in Punjabi folk dancing, modern 
Bhangra has been transformed into a lively dance style 
that hints at hip-hop and other modern in?uences. The 
teams performing last Saturday all put on technically 
stunning performances, the main discrepancies between 
the acts being the level of modern in?uence.
Columbia Bhangra started the night off strong. The 
group put on one of the more modernized performances 
and was able to energize the crowd, setting a good vibe 
for the rest of the night.
Crowd favorite FCB, an all-male Pittsburgh-area Bhangra 
group, brought a similarly modernized performance, 
easily the most dynamic and energetic performance 
of the night. The energy was evident before the dance 
even started; the dancers pumped up the audience 
by jumping excitedly up and down as they took the 
stage in dim lighting. The crowd cheered continuously 
throughout the performance.
The last competitive team to take the stage, UVA Di 
Shaan, ended the competition with another high-
energy dance with obvious modern in?uence. Their 
performance started off with the most exciting light 
show of the night with rainbow colors ?ashing along 
with the beat. The fun didn’t end there, however: The 
performance was once again on the less traditional side, 
infusing techno music and hard-hitting hip-hop moves, 
and the choreography was both technically challenging 
and engaging for the audience.
Emphasizing one of the modern styles that has had a 
great impact on Bhangra, Carnegie Mellon’s elite hip-
hop team Soulstylz also made an appearance. Although 
not so ?ashy and colorful as the Bhangra dances, 
Soulstylz provided a refreshing and creative set that left 
the audience wanting to dance along.
Cornell Bhangra, who placed second at last year’s 
Bhangra in the Burgh, came out with choreography that 
had moments of obvious modern in?uence balanced 
with a traditional overall feel. Cornell boasts one of the 
oldest Bhangra teams that competed, and the members’ 
experience was very obvious. The performance brought 
the night’s energy to a whole new level and the crowd 
roared before the dancers even took the stage. Their 
timing was impeccable; they truly danced as one 
cohesive group.
VCU Bhangra, a newcomer to the BIB stage, performed 
a similarly balanced dance. The team’s set, with its 
relevance and synchronization, produced a comparably 
great crowd reaction.
Another exhibition act, Penn Masti broke up the ?nal 
run of Bhangra performances with its South Asian jazz 
fusion-styled performance. Their choreography was 
technical and captivating, at times very sexy and other 
times emulating a traditional folk dance.
Also demonstrating the in?uence modern culture has 
had on tradition, Deewane — Carnegie Mellon’s all-male 
South Asian fusion a cappella group — performed a 
short set. The team offered a captivating mash-up of a 
traditional song and an instantly recognizable ’90s hit —
the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way.”

Bhangra in the Burgh fuses modern styles with traditional dance
Eight competitive teams perform at Oakland’s Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall as part of the seventh annual cultural event
by Kelsey Scott | Operations Manaager[]
Performing directly after Columbia, GMU Bhangra’s 
performance was starkly more traditional. They were the 
?rst performance group of the night to bring a dholi, a 
performer who plays a traditional Punjabi drum, into the 
mix.
SMD Bhangra Club, the only all-female performance 
of the night, also came out strong and performed its 
traditional piece with the most excited and passionate 
faces seen at the competition. The dance’s musicality 
was nearly unmatched in the competition.
Last year’s BIB champion, Cal Bhangra, kicked off the 
second half of the show with an analogous musically 
conscious and highly entertaining performance. 
Although it didn’t receive the same roaring applause 
as last year, crowd members happily watched the 
heartwarming performance with bellies full of samosas.
A performance by Pitt’s PantheRaas continued the 
theme of traditional Indian dance, but broke up the 
Bhangra ?ow with a Garba-Raas styled dance. Garba and 
Raas are both traditional Indian dances from the Guijarat 
and Vrindavan regions of India respectively. Their 
performance included similarly ostentatious costumes 
and the dancing had some similarities to Bhangra, but it 
brought a distinct Indian ?air to the night.
While the scores were still being tallied backstage, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Chak de Bhangra took the stage as 
many of the performers’ peers cheered them on from the 
audience. At the end of the performance, the entire Chak 
de Bhangra family stormed the stage, marking the peak 
of the night’s energy level.
After the Carnegie Mellon performance, much of the 
crowd began to ?le out while the judges were still 
deliberating. When the awards were ?nally presented, 
crowd favorite FCB took ?rst place followed by Cornell 
Bhangra, the runner-up from last year’s competition. 
GMU Bhangra secured third place.
Clearly there was no favored balance of tradition 
and modern in?uence when it came to the judging 
perspective, with a modern, mixed, and traditional team 
claiming each of the top spots respectively. The night 
featured a great blend of traditional culture and modern 
fun, creating a strikingly colorful, energetic, and musical 
experience.

Released on his website last Tuesday, Bob Dylan’s 
“Like a Rolling Stone” ?nally has an of?cial music video, 
and there’s a good chance that it’s like nothing you’ve 
ever seen. Instead of being one video, there are 16 
independent videos that viewers can actively navigate, 
each featuring Dylan’s song as the soundtrack. The video 
is meant to simulate the experience of channel sur?ng, 
with each video a recreation of standard cable fare with 
actors lip-syncing the lyrics while acting as one would 
expect given their respective roles. A news anchor sits 
at a desk surrounded by computer screens and Price 
is Right contestants spin the big wheel with sparkling 
numbers. Women from a Bachelor-like show claw at each 
other’s hair and the hosts of History Channel’s Pawn 
Stars inspect an old guitar and appear to haggle over 
dollar amounts.
The only thing that appears out of place among these 
incredibly authentic recreations is that everyone appears 
to be lip-syncing to “Like a Rolling Stone” without 
realizing they’re singing a song. According to a Rolling 
Stone article, to rehearse scenes, actors would speak 
authentic dialogue and then the Dylan lyrics would 
be substituted in at the last minute. For example, the 
woman hosting a mockup cooking show rehearsed 
by actually explaining the recipe she is preparing 
and then replaced the recipe with lyrics once she had 
mastered how she would explain the recipe. This kind 
of commitment is evident across every channel and 
the effect is incredibly surreal, especially when placed 
in particular contexts such as a reporter covering a 
resurgence in the Occupy protests and a mockup of the 
Home Shopping Network. The transition from channel to 
channel is incredibly seamless, with the actors’ mouths 
always picking up exactly where the last channel left off 
in the song.
Directed by 27-year-old Vania Heymann, the music video 
is both a technological and artistic achievement. The 
available channels are carefully selected as subjects to 
be indicted by the song’s contempt. Flipping through, 
one begins to garner a sense that nearly everything that 
makes up and de?nes Western civilization is indicative 
of cultural regression instead of progression. Our cultural 
leaders — everyone from politicians to rap stars — are 
like actors that are reading a bad script. The music video 
puts these actors up on a stage and throws vegetables at 
them, with the channel depicting Dylan himself playing 
the song in 1965 the only one worthy of applause.
Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone” — one of many of 
his songs jockeying for the position of his “signature 
tune” — was already on the cutting edge when it 
was originally released 48 years ago, when Dylan, 
the hero of the traditional folk scene of the early ’60s, 
used it to shatter his previous public image. The 
hard snap of Bobby Gregg’s drum kit combined with 
Mike Bloom?eld’s stinging blues guitar is a killer 
sound, but was only made possible by breaking the 
ultimate commandment of folk music: playing electric 
instruments. Bob Dylan bridged the gap between folk 
and blues and thus changed American popular music for 
the better by breaking the rules and adapting to the new 
technologies available to musicians. The music video 
is a testament to the song’s innovative spirit, and proof 
that it’s still just as relevant in 2013 as it was in 1965.
Music videos have come a long way during their 
relatively short existence. On Aug. 1, 1981, the TV 
channel MTV debuted, forever changing how we 
interact with music. At ?rst artists opposed this idea, 
believing their popularity would be based more on how 
good they looked in front of the camera instead of their 
music. As the medium matured, however, directors 
began to emerge that could create videos to compliment 
a song rather than to create entirely new experiences 
by themselves. Spike Jonze, Samuel Bayer, Hype 
Williams, Jonathan Dayton, and Valerie Faris all helped 
elevate the music video to become something more 
than a marketing tool by creating short ?lms that truly 
are works of art. See videos for Nirvana, Red Hot Chili 
Peppers, Kanye West, Beastie Boys, and Arcade Fire as 
examples of their work. With his video for “Like a Rolling 
Stone,” Vania Heymann has pushed the music video 
even further and has demonstrated the near-endless 
possibilities for the form. Now the question is, what 
comes next?
