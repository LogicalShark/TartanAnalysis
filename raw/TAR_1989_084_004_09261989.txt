Shutdowns plague Andrew upgrading process

A number of shutdowns have plagued 
the Andrew File System (AFS) in the 
past two weeks. The shutdowns occur as 
Transarc, the company responsible for 
the administration of AFS, is in the 
process of upgrading the system.
Andrew Support Manager Chris Thy- 
berg monitored the situation from the 
beginning, documenting it on Andrew’s 
electronic bulletin boards, or bboards.
“There are fifteen file servers, called 
vices, that hold the software and the 
users’ data for the campus.... Transarc 
was involved in updating the system,” 
says Thyberg. “Transarc is a company 
that was founded by CMU people in 
June. The founder, Alfred Spector, was 
the director of ITC and professor of
“We released a bug fix, and at 5 am all of the 
fileservers restarted with this new software, 
and all hell broke loose.”
— Andrew Support Manager Chris Thyberg
computer science. Most of the designers
— the people who created and really 
understand the Andrew file system tech­
nology at a very deep, fundamental level
— went to Transarc.”
As of July, Carnegie Mellon was be­
hind schools like MIT and Michigan who 
already had all of the components of the 
updated system running. Thyberg be­
lieves CMU has problems with this sys­
tem because “of the load that we put on
it and because of the fact that we try to 
implement an automatic backup system 
for all of this data.” Thyberg said that 
when the Andrew administrators do this, 
“we break it. We’re on the leading edge of 
this stuff, and we break things that other 
people say are working fine, just because 
we are pushing them to the limits.”
The problems began in July when the 
new system was introduced at CMU.

Groups vie for Skibo space
By ANDREW WHEELER
Tartan Staffwriter
Administrators and students 
met last week to develop a policy 
for the allocation of student office 
space in Skibo, because, student 
leaders say, no one seems to know 
what the current policy is or even 
if it exists.
The need for a new assignment 
system arose this summer, when 
Dining Service vacated one of its 
offices in Skibo’s lower level. 
Scotch ‘N’ Soda moved into the 
empty space, emptying its former 
office.
Of eighty-three campus organi­
zations, only seventeen have of­
fice space in Skibo. According to 
Bonnie Gorman, assistant direc­
tor of student activities, two stu­
dent organizations have ex­
pressed an interest in using the 
office vacated by Scotch *N’ Soda. 
A new policy is needed to decide 
who will get the empty space. 
Gorman met with Director of 
Student Activities Anne Witch- 
ner and Student Senate Chair 
Frank DiVito last Thursday to 
formulate the new policy.
Gorman foresees a long period 
of research, including evaluations 
ofthe needs of organizations vying 
for space as well as those that
already have it, before finally 
developing a new plan. The group 
will also look at policies used at 
other universities. “We need to 
establish policies which can be 
communicated clearly.”
Gorman emphasized that there 
will be no reapportionment of the 
offices currently in Skibo. The 
policy will deal only with vacant 
space. “We won’t take space away 
from anyone,” she said. However, 
she added that current assign­
ments will have no bearing on 
spaces in the planned University 
Center. When the Center is built, 
every organization, including

Shirley Residents complain of harassment by gays near Dithridge
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon students who 
live near Dithridge Street claim 
they are being harassed near their 
residence, which is known as a 
gay cruising area. However, 
members of CMU’s Gay and Les­
bian Alliance play down the 
charges, saying that what some 
students perceive as harassment 
is merely a misunderstanding.
Many ofthe students complain­
ing about the alleged harassment 
are either current or previous 
residents of Shirley Apartments,
“It came to a point at which [Shirley 
residents] would get together to com­
pare stories that were basically the 
same.”
— Sophomore Andrew Sattler
located at 133 North Dithridge 
Street. Julian Stapleford, a so­
phomore civil engineering major, 
described an incident that oc­
curred around 11:30 pm on a 
weeknight late in the spring
semester.
“As I started to go up Craig 
Street, I noticed that a car was 
slowly following me with its lights 
on,” said Stapleford. Since he 
thought the car was followinghim,
he turned and walked in the op­
posite direction.
“After I began going south on 
South Craig Street, the car 
stopped near Pittsburgh National 
Bank. I turned onto the street 
that runs behind the Software 
Engineering Institute [Winthrop], 
and walked over to Dithridge, and 
then up Dithridge to Shirley 
Apartments.” Stapleford said that 
the car followed him to the apart­
ment building.
“He pulled up to me in the 
Shirley parking lot, and I ap­
proached him and frightened him 
off,” Stapleford said. He then
reported the incident to Campus 
Police.
According to Stapleford, the 
incident was not unique. He ex­
plained that he had been followed 
by cars in the area on several 
occasions.
One student described an inci­
dent that he said has made him 
avoid the Dithridge and Craig 
Street area since it happened. 
Sophomore biology major Andrew 
Sattler said that he was walking 
home to Shirley Apartments at 
around 4 am on a weeknight when 
a car pulled up. “The man asked

The Richard King Mellon Foundation has 
committed $6 million to the building fund of 
GSIA, according to an announcement on 
Wednesday by Carnegie Mellon President 
Richard Cyert and GSIA Dean Elizabeth 
Bailey. The $6 million represents the lead 
gift to the building fund for a 70,000 to 
80,000-square-foot addition to the existing 
building.
The addition will include several modern - 
teaching auditoriums and computer class­
rooms as well as new facilities for executive 
education and entrepreneurial studies. It 
will increase by more than 200 percent the 
amount of classroom and research space 
available at GSIA.
The planned addition,which is to be con­
structed adjacent to GSIA and behind the 
College of Fine Arts, will be attached to the 
existing building. Part of the area the 
building will occupy is currently occupied 
by the GSIA trailers.

Smith wins H&SS Dunlap award
Richard A. Smith is the winner of the 1988-89 Elliott Dunlap 
Smith Award for Teaching and Educational Service in H&SS, 
Dean Stephen Fienberg announced last week.
Smith, who joined Carnegie Mellon’s faculty in 1978, is an 
associate professor of political science and associate head of the 
Department of Social and Decision Sciences.
Fienberg said that since Smith came to Carnegie Mellon, “he 
has established himself as an outstanding classroom teacher, 
academic advisor, and departmental administrator.” Fienberg 
cited Smith’s consistently high course evaluation ratings as 
“attesting to the skill, enthusiasm, and care that he brings to 
classroom teaching.”
According to Fienberg, some of Smith’s most significant contri­
butions to the college are the contributions he made to Decision 
Processes in American Political Institutions, an H&SS core 
course offered by Social and Decision Sciences. Fienberg said the 
course is known as “one of the most well-designed and well- 
delivered courses in the core curriculum.”

Christian tanker 
sneaks past 
Syrian barrage
BEIRUT (AP)—An oil tanker 
carrying badly-needed gasoline 
for Lebanon’s besieged Christians 
played hide-and-seek for three 
hours with Syrian artillery be­
fore slipping into port before dawn 
Friday.
Police said the Lebanese- 
flagged Timex Star ran the gaunt- 
let of radar-controlled Syrian 
shellfire to deliver its cargo of 
660,000 gallons offiiel at Jounieh, 
12 miles north of Beirut.
The Christians, critically short 
of fuel after a six-month-long 
Syrian blockade, began unload­
ing the fuel 15 minutes after the 
tanker docked.
“The captain ducked into a bay 
north of Jounieh, putting 
mountains between him and the 
Syrian radar and blockingit. Then 
he hugged the coast to slip into
port,” a police spokesman said.
The spokesman, who spoke only 
on the condition of anonymity, 
said the Syrians used long-range 
artillery in Moslem west Beirut, 
from mountains overlooking the 
Christian enclave and in north 
Lebanon, in their effort to sink 
the Timex Star.
Syrian attempts to sink the 
tanker caused an artillery duel 
between the Syrians and Chris­
tian Gen. Michel Aoun’s forces in 
and around Beirut that left two 
people killed and seven wounded, 
police said. That raised the toll to 
929 killed and 2,738 wounded 
since the latest fighting began 
March 8.
Colombian 
minister resigns
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP)—The 
Colombian news program TV Hoy 
reported that Arturo Ferrer Car­
rasco, an economist in that 
country’s Finance Ministry, will
replace Monica de Greiff, who has 
resigned as justice minister, ac­
cording to a Colombian presiden­
tial palace source.
Radio Caracol said Colombian 
President Virgilio Barco accepted 
De Greiffs resignation and of­
fered her the ambassadorial post 
in Portugal, which she declined.
De Greiff won worldwide praise 
after she traveled to the U.S. in 
August to ask for help protecting 
hundreds of judges facing death 
threats by cocaine traffickers. 
Colombia’s cocaine traffickers 
continued their wave of bombings 
and arson last Thursday.
Bomb blasts damaged nine of­
fices of Colombia’s two main po­
litical parties and a bomb dam­
aged a bank. Two people were 
reported injured.
IRA claims 
credit for blast
DEAL, England (AP) —An ex­
plosion last Friday at the Royal 
Marines School of Music killed
eight people, injured thirty andt 
trapped at least seventeen in a 
building that collapsed, officials 
said. The Irish Republican Army 
claimed responsibility.
The blast occurred at 8:26 am 
local time, in a lounge in the, 
barracksnearDeal,acoastaltown' 
seventy miles southeast of Lon­
don, the Defense Ministry said.
“The building has collapsed,” 
said a ministry spokesman, 
speaking anonymously in keep­
ing with British custom. Scotland' 
Yard said that it sent anti-terror­
ist officers to the scene.
A statement telephoned to Ire- 
landlntemational, aDublinnews 
agency, said “we have visited the 
Royal Marines in Kent” in re- , 
sponse to Prime Minister Marga­
ret Thatcher’s visit to Northern ) 
Ireland nine days ago.
The IRA said Thatcher went to I 
the British province “with a

peace and we want the British 
government to leave our coun- ! 
try.”
Hurricane Hugo 
ravages islands, 
hits southeast
CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — 
The death toll in the wake of Hur­
ricane Hugo’s rampage through 
the southeast was raised to at 
least 10 in the Carolinas.
“It’s going to be miraculous if 
we don’t have a heavy loss of life,” 
said Gov. Carroll Campbell of 
South Carolina, where President 
Bush declared seven counties a 
federal disaster area. “It is the 
worst storm, the worst disaster, 
I’ve ever seen anywhere.”
Hugo was downgraded into a 
tropical storm at 6 am Friday and 
decayed more as it went inland, 
but places in its path could expect 
four to eight inches of rain and 
winds of 50 mph. At 3 pm EDT, it

was near Parkersburg, W. Va., at 
latitude 39 degrees north and 
longitude 82 degrees west.
Nine of the U.S. deaths were in 
South Carolina. Seven died in 
counties surrounding Charleston 
and one in the Columbia area, 
said Warren Hardy of the state’s 
Office of Emergency Prepared­
ness. An elderly man was found 
in the rubble of a house in Char­
leston, city officials said. In North 
Carolina, a six-month-old baby 
was killed in Union County when 
a tree fell on a house.
The center of the storm ad­
vanced farther westward than 
expected, targeting eastern Ohio, 
western Pennsylvania and west­
ern New York before it was ex­
pected to wear itself out in Can­
ada. It was moving to the north at 
30 mph.
Charleston felt the full wrath of 
Hugo, which wrecked a string of
Caribbean resort islands begin­
ning early Sunday. There were 
twenty confirmed deaths in the 
Caribbean, but an official in 
Puerto Rico said the death toll for 
the region was twenty-six people. 
About 50,000 people are home­
less.
USAir flight 
crashes in NYC
NEW YORK (AP) — A USAir 
737-400 carrying 63 people 
crashed into the East River Fri­
day after an aborted takeoff from 
LaGuardia Airport Wednesday 
night, splitting into three pieces 
and killing at least two people, 
authorities said.
Divers continued searching for 
the other six, although officials 
said some people may simply have 
left the site of the crash.
Flight 5050, bound for Char­
lotte, N.C., skidded off the run­
way and came to rest about 50 to 
100 feet into Bowery Bay. The 
runway extended onto pylons 10 
feet above the water. When the 
plane split, the nose remained! 
above Water, resting on approach 
lights, but the tail was almost 
completely submerged.
Officials said two passengers 
sitting in the rear of the plane 
were killed. Two people were; 
admitted to one hospital with 
serious injuries; a third was hos­
pitalized in stable condition after 
suffering a heart attack.
Officials said the pilot aborted 
takeoff at 11:29 pm for an un­
known reason.
USAir took delivery of the new 
plane in January and it had no 
history of mechanical problems, 
said airline spokeswoman Nancy 
Vaughan.

New satellite dish to train Campus Police
By DARLENE FOZARD
Tartan Staffwriter
This summer Carnegie Mellon’s 
Department of Security pur­
chased a satellite dish. Located in 
the Physical Plant Building, the 
new dish is being used to modern­
ize law enforcement training 
within the department. Programs 
aired by the Law Enforcement 
Television Network (LETN) are 
used by the department to regu­
larly update members of the de­
partment with the latest in law 
enforcement techniques.
Carnegie Mellon Campus Po­
lice is the third police department 
in the state to subscribe to the
system. Ofthe three departments, 
Campus Police is the only college 
campus police department to 
subscribe. The department 
learned of the system through a 
professional police magazine.
Law enforcement programs are 
aired twenty-four hours a day. 
Each morning, the programs for 
the day are reviewed. Any rele­
vant to campus police work are 
viewed and sometimes recorded 
for the rest of the department to 
watch, according to Sergeant 
William Ricci. Says Ricci, the dish 
provides “the most modem police 
training available. Law enforce­
ment is an ongoing process; you 
can never learn enough. If there’s
a change in laws or a new tech­
nique, you get it instantly.”
The programs cover all aspects 
of law enforcement training, from 
lifesaving techniques to legal 
updates. James LaPaglia, Direc­
tor of Security, is most 
enthusiastic about LETN’s pro­
grams on human relations. This 
is the first training he’s seen that 
“tells an officer how to communi­
cate with someone on the street. 
Communication is the most im­
portant weapon in avoiding 
problems,” said LaPaglia.
LaPaglia said that the training 
offered by the LETN system is 
combined with training from the 
Justice Department. There is also
a program with the Southern 
Police Institute for the supervi­
sors in the department.
According to LaPaglia, a 
supervisor who watches certain 
programs during the month may 
choose to be tested on the infor­
mation presented. In this man­
ner, supervisors can eventually 
receive an associate degree in 
police management.
LaPaglia says that his depart­
ment is assuming a “role of lead­
ership in the area.” He says that 
several departments in the area 
have come to review the system. 
Says LaPaglia, “Consideringthat 
the age of technology is here, why 
not take advantage of it?”

Transare upgrades Andrew system; software, hardware problems cause shutdowns

“This failed so badly that we had 
to back it out. OnAugustl5, after 
Transarc had worked on it, we 
tried it again.” Says Thyberg, “The 
new software offered us such great 
new functionality for administer­
ing the system that it was really 
important to try and get it out.” 
For example, as a result of an 
architectural limitation, the in­
troduction of new software into 
the old system required two hours 
for it to become available to the
public. An additional three to four 
hours were then needed to correct 
any problems. With the new AFS, 
introduction of new software will 
be realized throughout the sys­
tem almost instantaneously. 
“There are a lot of new features 
and benefits in this version of the 
software that are absolutely es­
sential for us to keep the system 
running at the level and complex­
ity that we do,” says Thyberg.
Thyberg cites another reason 
for continuing the pursuit of a

fully functional system. “Ifwejust 
stuck with the old software, we 
would be on our own. The people 
at Transarc will only help us with 
the new software.” Thyberg ques­
tions the ability of Carnegie Mel­
lon to cope with the old Andrew 
system if it gave up on the new 
system because, “Most of the 
people who developed the origi­
nal software are now at Transarc, 
busy trying to get the new system 
working to put it on the market.”
The longest shutdown occurred 
on September 7. “Although the 
volume server was working, we 
were still finding bugs and backup 
was still not 100 percent. We re­
leased a bug fix, and at 5 am all of 
thefilesèrvers restarted with this 
new software, and all hell broke 
loose.” When all of the worksta­
tions attempted to interface the 
restarted vices at once, a lock up 
occurred. Vices were shut down 
to combat the problem, which in- 
creaed the load on the other vices, 
worsening the problem.
“The first thing that we did was 
back out, but that didn’t have any 
effect,” said Thyberg. “The soft­
ware wasn’t the problem. A fault 
in the configuration of the 
fileservers was then found. The 
problem was that there was an,

insufficient amount of memory 
buffers. It was not an adequate 
resource and [the crash] could 
have happened at any time that 
there was a power flicker or some 
mass interruption on the network. 
The work load of all those work­
stations trying to reestablish 
contact with the vices was just too 
much. It was a disaster just wait­
ing to happen.”
“Our motivation from August 
15 on was that we had to get 
backups one hundred percent. It 
was very important to us,” said 
Thyberg. Without a backup, 
Andrew users could lose their 
work due to accidental deletion or 
hardware problems.
On September 18, Andrew ad­
ministrators found a new prob­
lem. “The new software that we 
released to fix the backup bug
had a core leak,” says Thyberg. 
“The system soaks up memory, so 
no one can use it until there is 
none left, and the system crashes. 
It takes one to one-and-a-half 
hours to restart after a crash and 
twenty to thirty minutes after a 
reset of the server. The result in 
both cases is although the system 
gets all the memory back, it starts 
consuming it all over again.”
In the three days it took Tran­
sare to solve the problem Andrew 
administrators monitored the 
vices constantly. “We were watch­
ing them very closely because we 
would rather restart them then 
have them crash,” said Thyberg.
According to Thyberg,“We’re at 
virtually one hundred percent 
now. Only about thirty to fifty 
volumes out of about 11,000 vol­
umes haven’t been backed up. The
fixes have worked, but they can’t 
uncorrupt what has been cor­
rupted; now that they’re gone, we 
can proceed with some cleanup 
and get things working again. We 
will be left with what we think to 
be a volume location database 
which is sound, and a backup 
process that will do its thing re­
liably.”
Addressing the inconvenience, 
Thyberg says “We were not af­
fecting the users that much; they 
knew that we were struggling.”
“CMU isn’t Transarc’s guinea 
pig” Thyberg points out. “We’re 
trying to get their product to run 
here. We’ve been through the proc­
ess of shaking out bugs. The only 
changes in the system that we are 
going to take from Transarc are 
fixes, we are not in ‘try it out’ 
mode for their new experiments.”

Gays dispute alleged harassment on Dithridge

what I was doing. I replied that I 
was on my way home to my apart­
ment. Then he asked, ‘Do you 
want a blow-job?’ ”
“That’s illegal. That’s solicita­
tion. It may or may not be harass­
ment, but it’s definitely illegal,” 
said Michael Witbrock of Carne­
gie Mellon’B Gay and Lesbian 
Alliance. He thinks that there may 
be a difference between what some 
people perceive as harassment 
and what is actually harassment.
Pennsylvania state law defines 
harassment as an act committed 
“with intent to harass, annoy, or 
alarm another person ... includ­
ing following a person in or about 
a public place or places; or engag­
ing in a course of conduct or re­
peatedly committing acts which 
alarm or seriously annoy” any 
individuals. In Pennsylvania, 
harassment is a summary offense.
Witbrock doesn’t think that
“someone saying 442445’ to a per­
son on the street” constitutes 
harassment. “There are people 
who are sufficiently alarmed by 
the thought of gay people that I 
could perceive that it’s something 
more alarming to them than it 
shouldbe.I’m not saying that this 
is the case for these people, but it 
may be that some of these cases of 
harassment are cases of panic.” 
Sattler said that the entire inci­
dent has made him really nerv­
ous about gay issues. “I realize 
that it’s not right to judge a whole 
on the basis ofits individual parts. 
But sometimes when an experi­
ence leaves a such a repulsive 
impression, it taints what was 
initially an unbiased opinion. ” 
Sattler didn’t think that what 
happened to him is uncommon. 
“It came to a point at which 
[Shirley residents] would get 
together to compare stories that 
were basically the same,” he Baid.
Aaron Krebs, a sophomore 
computer engineering majorfrom 
Shirley Apartments, saidthatthe 
“typical" incident occurs when he 
is walking home after 10 pm. “It’s 
worst on weekends,” he said. “I 
walk home as resolutely as pos­
sible, and out of the comer of my 
eye, I notice a car moving along 
side of me, but a little behind me. 
I know that it’s there, but then 
when I turn to look at it, it passes, 
and turns to presumably go 
around the block. After walking 
about another half a block, I no­
tice out of the comer of my eye 
that it is there again. But when I 
turn to look atit,itpassesand the 
whole thing starts over again."
Krebs said that if he was walk­
ing four blocks home, a single car 
will pass him as many as four or 
five times.
GALA’s Michael Franzini ques­
tions whether harassmentof resi­
dents in the area is a chronic
“There are people who are sufficiently alarmed by the 
thought of gay people that I could perceive that it’s 
something more alarming to them than it should be ... it 
may be that some of these cases of harassment are 
cases of panic.”
— GALA member Michael Witbrock
problem. “If a male college stu­
dent walks down Dithridge Street 
atl am, he’s going to be perceived 
by many people in the area to be 
gay merely because of where he 
is. And it’s likely that if he’s walk­
ing down the street at that hour, 
someone is going to say ‘hello’ to 
him or someone will pull up to 
him in a car and say 442445.’ I can 
see how that would be perceived 
as harassment, but I think that 
that is the extent of what would
happen. I’d be surprised if any­
thing more serious than that 
would happen.”
Indeed, if incidents of harass­
ment have occurred, they have, 
for the most part, gone unreported 
to campus and city police.
Carnegie Mellon Police Chief 
James LaPaglia says that only 
two incidents of harassment were 
reported to Campus Police in the 
past three months.
Witbrock questions the scale of
the alleged incidents. “Even the 
fact that people have been cited 
for harassment is not necessarily 
an indication that harassment is 
going on.
“The police in Pittsburgh are 
not necessarily known for their 
respect for the spirit of the law. If 
they want to charge you with 
something, they will generally 
find somethingto charge you with. 
They have been known to make 
things up.”
GSIA receives $6 million; plans construction of addition
snSIgStph iane lwop 6
begin thinking about making plans for 
the building in that we have interviewed 
some architectural firms and are in the 
process of selecting an architect.”
Taaffe said that the gift along with 
other major gifts constitute about 50 to 
60 percent of the funds needed for the 
construction of the building.
GSIA is currently planning to have a 
groundbreaking ceremony at GSIA’s 40th 
anniversary celebration in the spring, 
according to Taaffe; however, she is un­
sure when actual construction will be­
gin. The building is scheduled for occu­
pancy by September of 1992.
Taaffe described the gift as “one of the 
largest to Carnegie Mellon’s Capital 
Campaign, and also one of the largest by 
a private foundation to a business school.
“I think that this lead gift will give us 
the momentum we need to arrive at our 
goal, and give our benefactors the confi­
dence that we shall succeed,” Taaffe said.
Bailey said that she believed that the 
additional space would help GSIA to 
develop programs that would comple­
ment the mission of the school and con­
tribute to regional economic development 
and business management.
“[The addition] will not only alleviate 
the overcrowding situation, but it will 
also help us to attract faculty and stu­
dents. In addition, it will enable us to go 
forward with some programs and re­
search projects that have been proposed 
by faculty but that have been put on hold 
due to space constraints,” Taaffe said. 
Special projects like Simulab that are 
currently housed in trailers, as well as 
several proposed partnerships with cor­
porations, are some projects that will
benefit from the new addition.
“This exceptional investment will make 
it possible for GSIA to pursue an exciting 
strategy for the 1990s,” Bailey said. “We 
want to create links with corporations 
and others throughout the world to en­
sure that GSIA will continue to be at the 
frontiers of knowledge in such fields as 
technology, finance, and entrepre­
neurship. We are dedicated to further 
enhancing Carnegie Mellon’s impact as 
a leading innovator in research and 
education.”
Taaffe heads the fund-raising and
external affairs division of GSIA. GSIA 
and SUP A, two of Carnegie Mellon’s 
graduate schools, are the only colleges 
within the University to have decentral­
ized fund-raising and external affairs 
departments. Fundraising for projects 
in other colleges is handled largely by 
the University’s central fundraising of­
fice. “Virtually all of the top business 
schools have their own decentralized 
external affairs departments [to handle 
the tasks of] fundraising, public rela­
tions, publications, and alumni rela­
tions,” says Taaffe.
Skibo space

those already holding Skibo office 
space, will need to apply for space 
in the new building.
In the words of Student Gov­
ernment President Mark Mittel- 
hauser, the present assignment 
policy is an “enigma.” Adminis­
trators and students agree that 
there is basically no policy, al­
though rumors concerning the 
way space has been allocated in 
the past abound.
One such rumor claims that 
Student Affairs maintains an 
ordered “waiting list” of organi­
zations who want office space. 
Student Affairs, as well as some 
student leaders, deny the exis­
tence of such a list. “As far as I 
know, the list has never been 
seen,” said Student Senator Mat­
thew Ruben.
Another possible option for 
organizations seeking office space 
may present itself upon the com­
pletion of the new dormitory. A 
dining service facility will come 
into operation there to replace 
the Kiltie Cafe. The space left by 
Kiltie’s exit may be used for office 
space. This is not a certainty, 
though, as several ideas on how to 
use the space are being consid­
ered.
Until the University Center is 
built, limited office space will 
continue to be a problem. Every­
one involved in the development 
of the new policy sees it as a 
positive step which will help alle­
viate any confusion. “We hope to 
determine a policy which is equi­
table and fair,” said Witchner.

President - Mark Mittel- 
hauser:
Mark mentioned that the for­
mation of his committees is pro­
gressing well. They should be 
meeting by next week. He also 
discussed the PAT U-ticket situ­
ation. Mark will be submitting a 
written report asking the PAT 
authorities to continue the stu­
dent tickets. Mark also reminded 
everyone that on Sept. 27th, 
Carnegie Mellon will be hosting a 
conference on the Alcohol Abuse 
on University Campuses. It will 
be at 3:30 in DH 2315, and all are 
welcome to attend.
Treasurer - Lisa Melenyzer:
Lisa announced that there will 
be a F&R Committee meeting on 
Sunday, Sept. 24 from 3:00-4:30. 
She also stressed the importance 
that all committee members at­
tend.
Student Senate Chair - 
Frank DiVito:
Frank passed out the new Sen­
ate key cards, and reminded ev­
eryone thatofficehours start Wed. 
Sept 20th. Office hours from 
12:30-1:30 will be held in Grey 
Matter, and Senators with office 
hours at those times can pick up 
the Senate sign in the office and 
sit at a table in Grey Matter. On 
Wednesdays, the 12:30 office 
hours will be held in conjunction 
with Student Affairs ‘Campaign 
for Great Ideas.’
The Chair also announced the 
vacancies for fall semester. There 
will be 2 CIT, 2 GSIA, and 2 SUPA 
seats available. Interested stu­
dents in those schools can get a 
petition from the Skibo Info Desk, 
fill the petition with 25 signa­
tures of fellow classmates, return
the petition by Oct. 2nd, and 
appear before Senate on the 3rd 
when the election will be held.
The Chair also fieldeda sugges­
tion about using nameplates 
similar to the ones used last 
semester to help new Senators 
with names.
Academic Affairs - Matt 
Ruben: Academic Affairs met and 
discussed the feasibility of a 
Human Relations course. The 
committee willbe looking into the 
training and pay of CSW TA’s for 
ideas on student teachers, as well 
as the availability of classrooms 
duringthe 3:00,3:30 or 7:30 hours, 
especially the CSW lecture room, 
Baker Hall 140.
Mark Steppel will be talking to 
the University Teaching Center 
concerning a faculty member in 
the School of Computer Science. 
He will be investigating the pos­
sibility of monitoring the classes 
of this person with the idea that 
suggestions could be generated.
Campus Affairs - Roy Con­
ard: Ideas discussed at the last 
Campus Affairs Committee meet­
ing include smoking in campus 
buildings. A comment was made 
that people have been escorted 
out of academic buildings for 
smoking in the halls. Roy re­
sponded that all academic build­
ings must have smoking areas, 
but was not sure exactly who is 
responsible for that or where these 
areas are. Mittelhauser suggested 
any questions be addressed to Pete 
Callopy in the Dept, of Environ­
mental Health and Safety.
The Campus Affairs committee 
will hopefully have a bike rack 
proposal by the end of the month 
dealing with new bike racks as 
well as moving the old ones.
Barbara Moura met with Dean 
Murphy concerning the hours of
the Health Center. Dean Murphy 
talked about three possible ac­
tions concerning the Health Cen­
ter. First, he discussed Saturday 
hours, and how this does not look 
feasible at the current time. This 
action will be reevaluated once 
the Health Center is accustomed 
to the new staff. Second, he talked 
about better information for self- 
help of students. The ideas of 
having an information center and 
what type of literature would be 
most helpful is under 
discussion.Lastly, Mike talked 
about the possibility of having a 
24 hour hotline manned by a nurse 
or doctor. Hopefully this aspect 
will be taken care of by next 
month. A question was raised 
about the current policy of having 
all appointment calls screened by 
a nurse to assess need. Murphy 
will also look into this.
Funding and Recognition - 
Nicole Brockmann: The Chair 
of Senate mentioned that a spe­
cial allocation will be brought up 
during new business.
Public Relations - Deana 
Erdner: The Senate retreat is 
this Saturday, the 23rd, at the 
College Club on S. Craig, from 11 
am to 5 pm. A map on how to get 
there will be posted on the office 
door.
Rules: A Rules committee will 
be held on Thursday at 7 pm where 
voting will be done on issues 
concerning seniority. Also a 
stronger definition of political will 
be discussed. It is very important 
that all committee members at­
tend, and other Senators are 
welcome.
Points of Discussion: A ques­
tion of 7:30 exams was asked, and 
Ruben responded saying that 
Steppel will be working on that 
issue.

Students want (and need) pets
What has perennially been con­
sidered a trivial gripe is surfacing 
again, threatening to become a 
major complaint.
Students want to have pets at 
school.
The school has a simple policy 
on the subject. Briefly stated, it 
says that no student can have any 
pet, other than a fish, on campus.
Granted, most rooms are too 
small for dogs and cats. But why 
can’t someone who lives in a small 
room have a hamster or a gerbil 
that will stay inside a Habitrail?
Similarly, why can’t someone 
who lives in a larger apartment 
have a cat or small dog? As long as 
roommates agree to have a pet 
and take the responsibility to care 
for it, they shouldn’t be denied.
The argument against pets goes 
along the lines that with animals 
come messes and' odors, which 
could lead to illness in people.
But we’d like to point out that 
with people themselves come 
messes and odors. If we expect — 
and demand — students to clean
up after themselves as respon­
sible members of a residence 
community, why shouldn’t we 
allow them to take responsibility 
for their pets?
Studies have proven the thera­
peutic benefits of pets. Imagine 
being able to play frisbee with a 
dog out on Flagstaff after a tough 
day of classes, or curling up with 
a cat when feeling depressed or 
homesick. Many nursing homes 
have “adopt-a-pet” programs for 
the elderly — why can’t CMU?
Stray animals are dangerous 
and nuisances. Occasionally, they 
find their way onto campus. If 
security officers find them, they 
take them straight to the pound, 
where we all know the likely re­
sult for the animal. But if a stu­
dent finds a stray and tries to care 
for it in his or her dorm, the stu­
dent risks a housing violation and 
disciplinary action.
With enforced leash and curb­
ing laws like New York City’s, 
campus could easily become a 
more fun and relaxing place.
Student Affairs is getting on the ball
Bashing Student Affairs for 
being reactive instead of proac­
tive used to be easy. Things are 
changing, though.
One example is a program called 
The Forum, a weekly series of 
meetings designed to educate 
students and promote human re­
lations in a relaxed setting.
The list of topics past and future

The next step is for Student

programs are interesting, acces­
sible, and attended.
Other good programs have died 
due to lack of enthusiasm or

cancel programs that have poor

reasons for it. If the program itself 
is a dud, then axe it. Otherwise,

The Housing Office and Cam­

More importantly, the students’ 
peace of mind was restored. With 
all the other things on the average

that the Housing Office is depend­

Editor:
The September 19 editorial in the 
Tartan entitled “Sexual harassment 
takes on many forms” initially struck me 
as rather supportive of the efforts of CRY 
OUT! to stop the threat of homophobic 
violence and heterosexist harassment 
by the authorities. However, the second 
part of the article left me with a very 
disturbed feeling. At first reading it 
struck me as a poorly written editorial 
that ended with ambiguous arguments 
and ended without a clear editorial state­
ment. After subsequent readings, how­
ever, I found that there was an editorial 
comment here, obscure as it was.
The editorial starts out reasonably 
enough. It briefly goes into the history of 
the Dithridge Street problem and speaks 
about the reality of harassment. The 
turning point occurs in the key phrase, 
“there’s a fine line between just joking, 
or flirting, or trying to pick someone up, 
and harassment.” It is obvious that this 
is referring to the actions of the gay men 
on Dithridge Street. If it were about the 
police force’s intolerance, it would have 
said there was a thin line between keep­
ing order and initiating a campaign to 
force gays away through verbal insults 
and intimidation. If it were referring to 
the attitudes of “fag bashers,” it would 
have said there was a thin line between 
homophobic feelings, or verbal insults, 
or murder. The sexual harassment this 
editorial conjures is that of gay men 
openly displaying their sexuality to the 
straight people in the area.
The editorial goes on to say that “every 
time one person starts to get close to 
another person’s ‘sexual space,’ there’s a 
risk of overstepping the boundaries of 
acceptable conduct.” This is a nice way of 
expressing their warning that lesbians, 
gays, and bisexuals should not openly 
display their sexual orientation in public 
where it might be viewed by straights. I 
may not personally condone the behav­
ior of all of the people who hang out on 
Dithridge, but in this society where 
straights have absolute power and force 
their sexuality in the faces of lesbians, 
gays, and bisexuals everyday, every­
where, one little block is hardly a propor­
tionate allocation for gay men to do what 
happens everywhere else in this city for 
their straight brothers and sisters.
I can accept the editorial’s statement 
that we all “need to develop a healthy 
respect for the rights of others ... gay or 
straight. ...”However,itappearsthatthe 
the editors are simply using this position 
to support an anti-gay argument.
It is the last paragraph that particu­
larly disturbed me. “Hopefully, we’ll all 
(read as meaning gays, cops and neigh­
bors) get our acts together soon — and 
we’ll let Dithridge Street return to a 
sleepy little place that nobody can quite 
remember enough to point out on a map.” 
This is simply terrifying. If the previous 
two paragraphs were absent this could 
be a vision of peace and harmony where
MpIIpad In IAp -hgIna
gay men are able to go about their busi­
ness without anti-gay reaction by soci­
ety. However, with the tone that the 
editorial has already set up, it supports 
the Police Department’s efforts to in­
timidate gays, makingthe Dithridge area 
once again a place where the straight 
world does not have to see the gays or be 
propositioned by one. This is simply in­
tolerance.
I now refer you back to the title — 
“Sexual harassment takes many forms.” 
It is not speaking of the hatred inflicted 
on lesbians, gays, and bisexuals, but 
rather it refers to the notion that gays 
making their presence felt in a straight
world threatens heterosexuality. There* 
is a big difference between being straight 
and having someone of the same sex 
express their attraction to you and being 
gay and having someone express their 
hatred and fear of you. The former is a 
non-threatening situation that although 
it may make some up-tight people feel 
uncomfortable, has no repercussions of 
violence. The latter is harassment and 
the threat of violence is real.Violence 
and harassment will never make gay 
people go away, it will only bring them 
out stronger and more unified as that 
rally on Saturday, September 16 did.

Activist claims both editorial 
and news story
Editor:
Last week’s editorial, “Sexual harass­
ment takes many forms” was a twisted 
and muddled attempt to divert attention 
from the deep-seated problem which is 
the cause of the recent uproar in the 
Dithridge Street area: anti-gay bigotry.
You wandered aimlessly through 300 
words of patronizing bullshit without 
coming out and saying what you wanted 
to say. With all of your talk of “sexual 
harassment” and “overstepping the 
boundaries of acceptable conduct,” you 
were condemningpeopleforbeingopenly 
gay in an area where you think they 
don’t belong.
Why didn’t you just come out and say 
“it’s fine for people to be gay, as long as 
they stay away from me?” After all, what 
is the sexual harassment you were talk­
ing about? According to CMU Security 
there have been no reports of sexual 
harassment in that area. Were your 
reporters who went to Dithridge “posing 
as gays” sexually harassed? (How the 
hell do you “pose as a gay,” anyway?) If 
so, it’s curious that your news story didn’t 
report that harassment, considering that 
it seemed to be the thrust of your edito­
rial.
Although you were anxious to talk 
about your (yet unsupported) allegations 
of sexual harassment on the part of gay 
men, you ignored the fact — and it is a 
fact, to which dozens of people can attest
— that the police harass law-abiding 
citizens because of their (perceived)
insult gays
sexual orientation. One of your “posing^ 
reporters, during his one hour venture 
to Dithridge Street, was approached by a 
police officer and asked to leave, although 
he was not breaking the law. Had he 
stayed a bit longer, he almost certainly 
would have been arrested.
The police problem in the Dithridge 
area has become so serious that the only 
people who have dared to walk the streets 
at night recently are gay activists. Your 
news story neglected to mention that the 
reason I was in the area two weeks agifr 
with other CRY OUT! activists was to 
ensure that the police didn’t “overstep 
the boundaries of acceptable conduct.”
At the CRY OUT! demonstration last 
week, two police officers were heard re­
ferring to the demonstrators as “fag? 
gots.” At the highly publicized raid on 
the Travelers night club two years ago, 
virtually all of the nineteen officers pres­
ent called the patrons “dykes” and “fag­
gots” as they assaulted and arrested 
them. No disciplinary action was evet 
taken against any of the officers, despite 
written testimony from over eighty wit­
nesses.
You can ignore the deadly serious is­
sue of anti-gay bigotry in the guise of law 
enforcement and go on with your mis­
guided sermon about “sexual harass­
ment.” I think that most of your readers 
can see that you’ve missed the point.
Michael Franzini,
Pittsburgh
Ed. Note —In last week’s editorial, we 
attempted to discuss the specific problem 
of police harassment of gays on Dithridge 
Street on a more abstract level, that of 
sexual harassment, of any form, on or 
near campus.
Although we think it is probable that 
some straight men have been harassed by 
gays in the Dithridge Street area, we find 
it more likely that gay men in the area
have been harassed by the Pittsburgh 
Police. It was our intention to support the, 
gay men who frequent Dithridge Street, , 
not to offer any anti-gay sentiment.
Our position was, and is, that ever)' 
member of society needs to deal with till\ 
sexuality of others in a mature manner; 
we feel that our message applies equally 
to members of the Pittsburgh Police force,; 
student body, and general public.
Balletbo obsessed with female domination
Editor:
In A Clockwork Orange, Alex urged us 
to emancipate women. I looked around 
the room at the men nodding their heads.
I felt good being a man during this 
movie. Alex talked about a woman who 
wouldn’t have sex with him, so he and a 
bunch of pals raped her. It was an ex­
pression of power; an active response to 
a woman.
Emancipate women? I nodded with
the rest of them. Then I attended a lec­
ture by Anna Balletbo where I heard 
men debased to the status of penises. 
Emancipate women? Which women? The 
same women cheering as a thousand 
woman in Spain crushed a couple of 
dumb penises?
I hated being a man at this lecture. 
Never has there been a lecture in which 
the vagina was more celebrated. Granted, 
this happened over in Europe, but so
many women loved it. I suppose it has 
redeeming qualities, but the contempt 
for men was so glaring that I had trouble 
seeing them. I don’t know how a man 
could sit there and not feel defiled.
Women have to be more aware of tb> 
messages being sent out to them, and a 
lot more aware of their reactions. But, 
actually, I do have faith in the willing 
ness of most women to see that.

'Conservative’ label is 
inappropriate for columnist
'JESSE, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE INTO 
ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM'
Letters to the Editor
Editor:
I must take issue with Eric 
Ewanco’s column of last week on 
two points: first on the topic of 
religion and abortion and second 
on the appropriateness of the 
column in general.
Mr. Ewanco argues emotionally 
from a Fundamentalist Christian 
viewpoint that abortion is the 
taking of an innocent life with few 
facts to support his argument. He 
neglects the fact that other relig­
ions including Protestants, Quak­
ers, Methodists, Jews, and Bud­
dhists do not subscribe to this 
position. Are these philosophies 
any less conservative than Fun­
damental Christianity?
Columnist’s beliefs questioned
Editor:
This letter is directed at colum­
nist Eric Ewanco.
Just like all true right wing 
conservatives you believe in the 
death penalty. Right? Of course 
you do, you’re a conservative col­
umnist. Now who’s being hypo­
critical about killing people? We’re 
allowed to kill bad people though,
I forgot.
I’m a radical believer in non­
publication of religious views, 
especially those that tend to 
impose on others.
And by the way, no one cares if 
you’re a radical Christian.

Union writer concerned 
with power, not morals
snSIgStph iane lwop .
Anna Balletbo versus A Clock­
work Orange was the basis for 
, Jen Bannan’s tirade in the Stu­
dent Union, titled “Emancipate 
Whom?!” Not surprisingly, she 
failed to see the irony of juxtapos­
ing these two events.
Bannan “felt good being a 
f woman during the lecture,” she 
enjoyed the “expression of power” 
by the women of Spain. At the 
same time, though, she con­
demned those who enjoyed the 
'"power” of the penis in A Clock­
work Orange.
* If Bannan’s double standard 
was a case of moral righteous­
ness, maybe that would be ac­
ceptable: afterall, a protest is far 
different than a rape. However, 
she completely distorted the
* messages of both the movie and of 
the women’s rights protest in 
Spain.
Most men at A Clockwork Or­
ange did not enjoy the violence, 
they enjoyed the nudity. The

Which brings me to my second 
point, the appropriateness of the 
column in general. Mr. Ewanco 
states, “In this column, I will be 
discussing various Christian re­
lated politics and the like,” yet 
the banner above the column leads 
the reader to believe the content 
is “conservative.”
I do not have a problem with a 
column that does discuss conser­
vative political doctrine, but I 
must object to a column used by a 
person as a pulpit to preach one 
religious viewpoint. I would ask 
The Tartan that this column be 
focussed on conservative issues, 
or provide all other religions rep­
resented on campus equal repre­
sentation in your newspaper.

When things go right,

4nSwIAwS MpNv
rape: the movie’s point was that 
conditioning even the vilest 
member of society is wrong be­
cause it limits his freedom (in this 
case to have sex or to defend 
himself). And the demonstration 
in Spain was not a victory by 
women over men, but a victory by 
right over wrong.
According to Bannan: “[Men 
are] going to have to try to be 
more aware of the meanings of 
the messages that are being sent 
out to them, and a lot more aware 
of the reactions they have to those 
messages.” Well, it seems to me 
that Jen Bannan reacts to every- 
thingin terms of “power.” It seems 
to me that Jen Bannan reacts to 
everything in terms of us versus 
them. It seems to me that Jen 
Bannan is more interested in the 
power of the vagina than in any 
moral elevation.
I just wish she was willing to 
see that.

I never thought I would be 
saying this, but there seems to be 
an unfortunate outbreak of san­
ity around here. Student Senate 
hasn’t done anything outrageous 
lately, Bush and congress have 
been pretty quiet, and even 
Warner Hall has been moderately 
calm.
I’ve been pulling my hair out, 
however, trying to come up with 
column topics. Competence and 
calm may be good for the country 
but they put editorial columnists 
in the unemployment line.
Therefore, I’m going to kill two 
birds with one stone this week 
and address a few things that 
have been rattling around in the 
back of my mind, things that 
would ordinarily get lost in the 
noise of major issues.
•I’ve noticed lately that all the 
female students at Pitt have the 
same haircut. I’m told that all the 
women at Slippery Rock Univer­
sity have the same haircut, too, 
although it is a different one than 
at Pitt.
•Whoever was in charge of 
replacing the locks in Mudge two 
weeks ago deserves to be compli­
mented. I live in Mudge and ex­
pected to be awakened early Sat­
urday morning by the people 
changing my lock. Instead, I woke 
up on my own at about 11 (hey, it 
was a Saturday!) having com­
pletely forgotten about the proj­
ect. I only remembered it when I 
tried to lock my door with the old 
key and discovered that it 
wouldn’t work. Good job, guys!
®Does anyone else find it dis­
comforting to watch tobacco state 
politicians curse the way drugs 
are ruining this country over a 
beer? Maybe the solution to the 
drug problem is simply require 
crack dealers to wear ties.
• For anybody who may not have 
noticed, I would just like to point 
out that my Chicago Cubs are in 
first place in the National League 
East with a week left in the sea­
son and the New York Mets are 
not. Enough said.

Jonathan Levy is a senior biology 
major and a first-year SUPA 
master’s student.
People who watch other people 
generally have a boring social life. 
I watch other people a lot. There­
fore, I have a largely boring social 
life.
I’m sure that most of my friends 
will strongly disagree with this 
observation. I can hear them say, 
“But Sue, you have an active so­
cial life — you go to frat parties 
and movies, even visit your 
friends, and you always seem to 
have such a great time.”
That’s right. I seem to have a 
great time. But how much fun can 
I have at a hot, crowded party 
where it’s too noisy to hear, and I 
can’t lip-read very well because 
all the people who talk to me 
make obscene mouth gestures due 
to the effects of beer?
How much fun can I have at a 
movie when I haven’t the slight­
est idea what it’s about due to the 
lack of subtitles? And how much 
fun can I possibly have sitting 
and watching my friends slap 
their knees and roll on the floor 
due to some hysterical joke I know 
nothing about (and by the time I 
do find out, it’s no longer that 
funny)? Well, let me tell you, I 
have loads of fun, and it’s simply 
because I’m a WOPAT.
A W OPAT is a W atcher of People 
and Things. What we do is exactly 
what it sounds like we do. We 
have very short attention spans 
and tend to focus on little things 
that no one else ever notices.
Take me, for example. During 
boring classes, I look for attrac­
tive guys, or see who is falling 
asleep. When I go to parties, I 
count the number of beers every­
one in the room has had. When I 
am with friends, I notice that they 
are wearing two different socks. 
When I’m at the movies, I watch 
the other people practically fall 
out of their seats from laughing
(and that can be pretty funny). 
No, I am not paranoid. I’m just 
observant.
None of my friends think I have\ 
a bad social life because I always 
laugh at the right time. Well, can 
I help it if someone way across the 
room trips at the same time some­
one at my dinner table tells a joke 
about the sexual behavior of his 
roommate? These things just 
happen. I try hard not to look 
bored so the people I am with 
won’t worry that I’m not having a 
good time.
So, I always have a happy ex­
pression on my face, and manage 
to look interested in everything. I 
do not mean to say that I don’t pay 
attention to anything, I just don’t 
pay attention when things are 
not directed to me, which is quite 
often in a group conversation. I 
know my friends do not leave me 
out in situations like this on pur­
pose — in fact, most of them for­
get I can’t hear because I con­
verse with just about everyone 
very well. But it does happen, and 
when I’m left out, I just take a 
good look around me, and see all 
that I can see.
So come on now, everyone. Don’t 
fall asleep or daydream when 
you’re bored. Become a WOPAT. 
You can learn so much just by 
watching people. You’ll see things 
people do when they think no one 
else is looking, like scratching 
those interesting parts of their 
bodies. It starts as a little inno­
cent thing, but then progresses 
into a series of rapid hand move­
ments which reach every corner 
of the body. YOU can start a lot of 
gossip on it, because YOU saw it 
first.
Just because I watch other 
people and see their habits doesn’t 
mean I’m bad. Watch me some­
day, and you’ll find out.

University should adapt a 'comparable 
worth’ policy of payment for employees
kIpf MpNgSp
Rare is the day that I feel 
sorry for President Cyert, but 
right now, I do. At least five 
people on campus are making 
more money than Dick. At face 
value, it just doesn’t seem right.
There’s been a lot of debate 
recently over comparable worth, 
paying people for how much 
their job is worth instead of who 
they are. I don’t have a beef 
with the people who are mak­
ing more than Cyert — when 
considering comparable worth, 
Allan Meltzer may be worth 
more than Cyert, but it seems 
like others are left behind.
For example, the University’s 
highest paid employees should 
be the two guys who keep En­
tropy open until 3 am. Keeping 
a store that sells cigarettes,
caffeine, and sugar open late does 
more for students than does SEI 
head Larry Druffel — CMU’s 
highest paid employee.
On the other end of the pay 
scale, I’d like to see the city em­
ployees who give out parking tick­
ets, the LCB, and Chuck Noll. 
None of them have done anything 
productive for years.
With the scale now established, 
we have an easy time determin­
ing where University employees 
belong on it. The people who 
spread manure on the Cut will 
land near the bottom while the 
people who sell Dunkin’ Donuts 
in Morewood will be near the top.
The job of a student may not be 
worth much, but the hours are 
hell. Does it seem right that it 
takes more than eight students’ 
tuition to pay Cyert’s salary? Let’s 
see first whether he could make it 
through 15-211 — then we’ll talk 
about money.
It seems that we’ve got it all 
wrong. The students are the 
ones doing the work while the 
administration works nine to 
five. Yet we’re paying to be on 
duty 24 hours a day.
Maybe it’s also time for a rea­
lignment of tuition. The more 
work we do, the less we should 
have to pay, and if a student 
crosses the line of that mythical 
40-hour work week, he should 
get overtime credit. Perhaps the 
University would pay him.
Oh well, it’s probably a pipe 
dream, but it is comforting to 
know that Cyert gets less in a 
year than Bubby Brister makes 
in a month, comparable worth 
sometimes does work.

Hugo had 
rotten timing
Hurricanes can be a real pain. 
Aside from the dangers of per­
sonal injury and property dam­
age, bad storms can cause 
nightmares for sports fans.
Last weekend, Hurricane 
Hugo destroyed property along 
the Eastern Seaboard, as well 
as the plans of a couple of die­
hard sports fans.
Eric and Bill left Atlanta on 
Thursday to come up to Pitts­
burgh to catch the Pitt-Syracuse 
game. Bill, an obsessive Orioles 
fan, suggested that they stop 
over in Baltimore to see the 
Birds play the Yankees on 
Friday.
They made the necessary ar­
rangements and reservations 
and planned to hit Pittsburgh 
early on Saturday and rest up 
for the 7:30 kick-off.
Now, these two do read, on oc­
casion, the front page of the 
newspaper while cruising 
through to the box scores. They 
knew a hurricane was in the 
vicinity, but didn’t think that it 
would seriously disrupt their 
plans. So, they packed their 
toothbrushes and headed up the 
coast for Baltimore.
About 12:30 in the morning, 
in South Carolina, they encoun­
tered some heavy rain. Again, 
no big deal.
Two hours later, they heard 
on the radio about Charleston 
getting hit by the hurricane.
The announcer said Hugo could 
go one of two ways: it would 
either turn right and head up 
the coast — right into Baltimore 
— or it would turn left and head 
inland towards Ohio.
Either way, Eric and Bill 
would have to drive through 
some heavy rain. They pulled 
over at a Stuckey’s and thought 
about what to do. Bill just 
pointed to his rain soaked 
Orioles hat. Eric got the idea.
They headed out again, and 
the rain got heavier.
Eric, a fan of late night radio, 
turned on the Larry King show 
to keep him awake at the wheel. 
A guy from a storm center in 
Maryland called in with an 
update. King asked him to sum 
up the situation for some of the 
larger cities on the east coast.
The guy ran down the pos­
sible situations for New York, 
Massachusetts, and D.C. About 
Maryland, he simply said, 
“Baltimore — gone.” He ex­
plained that the rain would 
continue throughout Friday and 
Saturday.
Bill, disheartened, threw his 
hat into the back seat looked at 
Eric and said, “Make a left.”
They turned up the road 
heading west and straight for 
Pittsburgh.
One hour into their new 
course, they learned that the 
weather guy in Baltimore was 
wrong. Hugo, decided to turn 
left and was, in fact, following 
Eric and Bill.
At about 4:30 am, the rain 
was at its worst. Eric couldn’t 
see three feet in front of his car 
and they were still, technically, 
one hour ahead of Hugo. He 
pulled into a rest stop and let 
the brunt of the rain pass.
They finally got to Pittsburgh 
in the afternoon on Friday.
They really weren’t all that 
sorry they missed the game in 
Baltimore.
When I asked them about 
their trip, Bill summed it up 
short and sweet: “I got to know 
Hugo, up close and personal. 
And he was a dick.”
The women’s cross-country team managed to turn in a fourth place finish out 
of nine teams in the Slippery Rock Invitational last Saturday, despite the 
inclement weather.
“We did pretty well, although it was freezing, “ said Carolyn Lowe, who 
finished tenth overall. “The weather was unbelievably rainy and cold, and the 
course was muddy,” she said.
Other top finishers for Carnegie Mellon were Kristen Burgard, who placed 
11th, Sue Johnson, 21st, Colleen Barkley, 39th, and Sue Sparks in 41st place.

Tartan Copy Manager
This week’s victim was Bethany 
College, who lost to the football 
Tartans, 42-0. Carnegie Mellon 
has beaten its last three oppo­
nents by a combined score of 
122-15.
“The kids played well,” said 
Head Coach Rich Lackner. Car­
negie Mellon (3-1,1-0 President’s 
Athletic Conference) had 28 first 
downs to Bethany’s (0-3, 0-1) 
nine, 470 total yards to Bethany’s 
166, and held the ball for almost 
40 minutes.
The Tartan defense kept the 
Bisons stymied all game long. 
Bethany managed only two first 
downs in the first half and man­
aged only one drive with more 
than one first down.
“It’s all ground control,” ex­
plained defensive tackle Ray 
Crouthers. However, Carnegie 
Mellon controlled not only the 
ground, but the air as well. The 
defense held Bethany quarter­
back Jamie Hamm to only three 
of 17 passes and intercepted three 
of his passes.
While the Tartan defense con­
trolled its ground, the “backfield- 
by-committee” claimedlarge parts 
of ground for itself. Division Ill’s 
sixth-best running game chewed 
out 302 rushing yards and scored 
three touchdowns.
The Tartans did have one streak 
stopped. For the first time this 
season, they were unable to score 
on their first drive. On CMLFs 
first play from scrimmage, the 
wet football squirted out of half­
back Drew Pizzurro’s hands and 
was recovered by Bethany’s Pat
Deiderickson at the CMU 32.
Bethany was not able to take 
advantage of the only opportu­
nity they got. Two plays later, 
Hamm lost control of the football 
which was recovered by line­
backer David Skinner.
After the initial fumble, it was 
back to standard operating proce­
dure for the Tartans. The back- 
field of Billy Snyder, Robert 
Schmitt, Scott Barnyak, Fran 
Bellante, and others carried the 
ball down the field with eight 
straight rushes down to the 
eleven.
Snyder then took to the air for 
the first time, finding Scott Bam- 
yak alone in the back of the end 
zone for a touchdown and a 7-0 
Tartan lead.
The second quarter was more of 
the same for Carnegie Mellon. A 
combination of rushing plus a pair 
of Snyder passes brought the 
Tartans downfield, capping the 
drive with a Pizzurro five yard 
touchdown run.
Two drives later saw more of 
the same. Defensive back Mike 
Danciak intercepted a Hamm 
pass, giving Carnegie Mellon the 
ball on its own 38. The Tartans 
quickly brought the ball down field 
with Pizzurro scampering down 
the right side of the field for an 
eighteen yard touchdown.
The snap on the extra point was 
off, but holder Don Decaro was 
able to carry the ball into the end 
zone for the two-point conversion 
and a 22-0 Tartan lead.
The second half proved no bet­
ter for Bethany. As the Bison

Men’s cross country takes 
second despite poor conditions
Despite the unusual absence of the team’s senior co-captain, Dave Supp, the 
men’s cross-country team managed to finish second in the Slippery Rock 
Invitational last Saturday. There were eleven teams competing overall with the 
host, Slippery Rock, placing first.
The team’s top runner, Dave Supp, was unfortunately unable to attend the 
meet. Len O’Neal also did not travel to the tournament this week. Both Supp 
and O’Neal stayed home due to illness.
Leading the Tartans was sophomore Russ Shorkey, finishing sixth overall.

Saturday, the CMU Soccer team traveled to At­
lanta for one of the toughest matches of its season 
against Emory University. Emory is ranked seventh 
in the nation among Division III schools.
The Tartans put forth what was, according to some 
team members, one of their finest performances of 
the season, but came up short, 2-1, in a game that 
was decided as much by poor officiating as by the 
strength of the two teams.
The game also featured a showdown between two of 
the University Athletic Association’s (UAA) best 
goalies. CMU’s Glenn Hoogerwerf came into the game 
with an impressive 0.98 goals average per game, but 
had to take second billing to Emory’s Phillip Scarbor­
ough, who came into the game with a string of four 
consecutive shutouts.
The Tartans started the game aggressively, and 
were able to put a lot of pressure on Emory’s defense 
until the officiating made its presence felt. At the 
15:30 mark, Eagles’ forward Scott Cahoon scored the 
first of his two goals on a free kick created by a call 
on CMU defender J.R. Yakubisin.
The call and subsequent score seemed to throw the
Tartans out of their tempo and they were able to offer 
little offense for the rest of the first half, which ended 
with Emory ahead 1-0.
Early in the second half, the Tartans committed a 
costly turnover as they were about to start an offensive 
drive, and the defense was caught flat-footed as Ca­
hoon scored again to give Emory a 2-0 edge.
The Tartans continued to stall offensively, due partly 
to the officiating, and to short tempers on both sides. 
About halfway through the second half, the two teams 
got into a shoving match, with two Tartans and one 
Emory player receiving warnings.
The incident seemed to fire up the Tartan offense, 
and a few minutes later, Alan Horn scored on a loose 
ball from a comer kick to cut the Emoryleadto2-l. The 
team comeback drive continued, but time ran out 
before it could tie the game.
In other action this week, Carnegie Mellon breezed 
by Washington & Jefferson, 6-1, Wednesday. The 
Tartans’ attack was highlighted by a pair of goals by 
Eddie Park, as well as single goals from Rob Schaefer, 
Alan Horn, Chris Kasabach, and a late penalty-kick 
goal by George Gauhan.
The Tartans travel to Case Western Reserve Uni­
versity today, then come home for Saturday’s Alumni 
Game.

UAA athletes of the week
The University Athletic As­
sociation (UAA) selects weekly 
athletes outstanding in their 
respective sports. The selections 
are drawn from nominees sub­
mitted by coaches and sports 
information directors in the 
Division III conference.
This week, CMU football’s 
Scott Bamyak was chosen for 
his performance in the Tartans’ 
35-8 win over the University of 
Chicago. Barnyak, a halfback, 
rushed for 103 yards on 12 car­
ries and scored a touchdown. 
This was his second consecu­
tive game in which he rushed 
for more than 100 yards. 
Bamyak’s new career rushing 
total at Carnegie Mellon is now 
1,108 yards, making him only 
the sixth player in CMU’s re­
cent history to rush for more 
than 1000 yards..
Women’s Cross-Country run­
ner Carolyn Lowe was also se­
lected by the UAA this week, 
after she led the Lady Tartans 
to a second-place finish at the 
Allegheny College invitational

Obesity, heart disease abound, despite booming health industryti
By SHEILA SKAFF
Tartan Staffwriter
College students need to become 
more aware of their health and 
fitness. Physical fitness is becom­
ing more and more of an intrinsic 
part of American life. With Jane 
Fonda, health spas, and diet Coke
becoming as much a part of this 
decade as FAX machines, the 
health industry has boomed, and 
exercise today is nothing short of 
a science. If this craze for exercise 
is the case, then why are people 
just as overweight as they were 
twenty years ago, and why are 
people still having heart attacks?
The reasons for this are varied 
but simple. Essentially, people are 
lazy and “don’t have the time” to 
exerciBe. They have an endlesB 
array of problems which inhibit 
exercise, and they feel they could 
never be able to run marathons, 
so why even try?
The fact is, it is terrific if you 
can locate every computer cluster 
on campus, but if it actually takes 
effort to walk the steps to get to 
those computers, it’s time to in­
corporate some kind of physical
activity into your daily routine.
This doesn’t mean it’s time to 
join the football team or switch 
your major to dance. All it means 
is everyone needs an outlet, and 
the person who becomes out of 
breath going to class will find the 
benefits of a half-hour walk five 
days a week outweighing the time 
involved. The benefits are that 
everything else will probably seem 
easier; from the late-night study 
sessions to the weekly guilt-rid- 
den call home to mom and dad. 
Although it won’t be fun at first, 
just use whatever mindset you 
used to ace that seemingly impos­
sible exam and start working out.
So much for the pep talk. In 
fact, one of the major reasons why 
people don’t exercise has to do 
with simply not knowing enough 
about it. In the following weeks,
this column will deal with health 
on the college campus, which in­
cludes nutrition, weight control, 
fightingdepression, and of course, 
exercise.
Exercise can be broken into two 
divisions — aerobic and anaero­
bic, with and without the use of 
oxygen. Aerobic exercise is any­
thing that lasts long enough to 
bring the muscles into burning 
oxygen. Aerobic exercise can be 
accomplishedby walking, jogging, 
swimming, or even rope-skipping 
if it lasts more than twenty min­
utes.
Aerobic exercise is designed to 
raise the efficiency of a body’s 
muscles, especially the heart. It 
makes them stronger by getting 
more oxygen to them, and it clears 
away waste products more effi­
ciently. The results include a
Arrival of Soviet players should make for 
interesting professional hockey season
By MICHAEL D.C. DROUT
Tartan Staffwriter
The 1989-90 hockey season 
should be the most exciting in 
years. At no time over the past 
decade have so many teams been 
so evenly matched within their 
divisions. While the domination 
of the Smythe and Adams divi­
sions should continue, with the 
Calgary Flames beingthe odds on 
favorites to repeat as Stanley Cup 
champions, there should be many 
surprises this year.
Just as the Gretzky trade was 
the news of last season, the arri­
val of Soviet players in the NHLis 
thisyear’s major story. Viacheslav 
Fetisov and Sergei Starikov with 
the New Jersey Devils, Sergei
Just as the Gretzky trade was the 
news of last season, the arrival of the 
Soviet players in the NHL is this 
year's major story.
Makarov and Sergei Priakin with 
the Flames, Igor Larionov with 
the Vancouver Canucks, and 
Alexander Mogilny with the Buf­
falo Sabres will all be playing this 
season and their impact could be 
either the news story or the mis- 
speculation of the year. If he 
as well as the Devils front office 
believes, Fetisov could be the first
player to win the Calder Trophy 
as a thirty-one year old.
The Devils could thus be the 
surprise team of the year or be 
forced to face another year of 
ignominy in the basement of the 
Patrick Division—which contin­
ues to weaken as the years go by.
1989-90 is the year for Mario 
Lemieux to show whether or not
healthier appearance, as well as 
a larger heart, with more arteri­
ole supply, which is able to pump 
more blood efficiently and effec­
tively with less work. Aerobic 
exercise is not meant to tax 
muscles to the straining point, 
and it is a key ingredient in keep­
ing the heart healthy. Although 
aerobic workouts need to be com­
bined with any kind of exercise 
program, they are the main goal 
of those just interested in feeling 
better and losing fat.
Many aerobic workouts require 
little more than time. Walking 
and runningrequire nothingmore 
than a good pair of shoes, swim­
ming can be done right on cam­
pus, and aerobic dance, which will 
be discussed next week, is offered 
at minimum prices 22 times per 
week. Anything that raises the
heart rate to within 70-85 per­
cent of the maximum heart rate 
at least twenty minutes at a time 
will work to increase stamina, so 
aerobic exercise can include any-, 
thing from cycling to stairwell 
running.
Aerobic exercise is for every­
one. To start, simply experiment 
to find something that you 
wouldn’t mind doing a few times 
a week. You may not like it at 
first, but stick with it, because it 
is necessary for anyone who wants 
to live a happy, healthy life.
Student Body is a weekly col­
umn that is devoted to student 
fitness and nutrition. Sheila Skaff 
is a freshman in the college of Hu­
manities and Social Sciences. Next 
Week: Aerobic Dance.
he is truly “greater” than Wayne 
Gretzky. If healthy, Lemieux 
should make a strong run for 
Gretzky’s point total record as 
well as regaining the Hart Tro­
phy — especially if the Penguin’s 
added defense helps them to go 
farther in the playoffs.
Surprise teams this year be­
sides the Devils should be Van­
couver and Buffalo. 1989-1990 
should be St. Louis’ year to finally 
get out of the division and could 
be the first time in the decade the 
bo thNewYork teams donot make 
the playoffs. Also, look for Roy 
and Hayward ofMontreal to make 
a real run at season-long goals 
against and point totals records 
as well as Gretzky to pass Gordie 
Howe’s scoring records.

“Underthe conditions, I think

Although the scores seem to

considered that the team was 
competing without two of their

finish within the top five at most 
meets.
Next week, the Tartans are 
at home against Geneva Col­
lege. The team is very confident 
that they will bring home the 
victory. Geneva College is not 
one of their tougher opponents, 
so some of the top runners for 
CMU may not even compete, 
providing a welcome rest for 
the runners.

Along with other Division III 
teams, there were also some 
higher division teams compet­
ing that the Lady Tartans didn’t 
expect to encounter. “Competi­
tion was a lot better than we’ve 
seen thus far this season, “ said 
Head Coach Dario Donatelli.
He also said that injuries took
a toll on the team. There were a 
couple of injuries to players 
hindered their abilities, espe­
cially on the tough course.
However, the team will re­
ceive a well-deserved rest this 
week that will aid in its recov­
ery before competing at Frost-

Intramural touch football continues with heated battles on
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Asst Features Editor
“What the f— do they keep hit­
ting me for?” yelled Carmine 
Fantini, the KDR quarterback, 
after being run out of bounds. 
Thursday, Fantini and his team 
went up against last year’s IM 
minors football champions, DTD.
Throughout the first half, the 
game was close. Both teams were 
impressive on the defense. DTD 
continually punched holes in 
KDR’s offensive line, sacking 
Fantini three times before the 
game ended. DTD put enough 
pressure on the KDR offense to
I force several bad passes and a 
w couple of bad punts. While KDR 
was on defense, it couldn’t reach 
x the quarterback, but they cov­
ered the DTD receivers so tight, 
that the quarterback had trouble
i with his passing game.
! The first quarter ended with no 
' score. Early in the second quar-
¦ ter, KDR started ,a drive that 
culminated in an interception. 
| Three plays later, Bo Esery, the 
DTD quarterback, completed a 
pass to Bryan “Bam Bam” 
MacDonald for a touchdown;
| however, the extra point attempt
was no good.
KDR’s next drive was shut down 
so hard that they looked like a 
bunch of six-year-old kids play­
ing the 49er’s. On the first down, 
Fantini was pressured into throw­
ing the ball away. The second 
down resulted in a sack for a big 
loss, which was accompanied by a 
third down sack for another loss. 
On fourth down, the KDR punter 
was under pressure and couldn’t 
kick the ball. He was forced to 
run out of bounds, which gave 
DTD a first down near the end 
zone. Four plays later, Esery 
connected with MacDonald for his 
second touchdown. The extra 
point attempt failed and the half 
ended with DTD leadingl2-0.
On the first drive of the second 
half, Esery hit Rob Coury for the 
third DTD touchdown. Esery ran 
in for the extra point and sud­
denly DTD was up by nineteen. 
KDR’s next drive consisted of 
three missed passes and a bad 
snap, followed by DTD’s two-play 
drive that resulted in its fourth 
touchdown, an Esery to Steve 
Lucente pass. Again, DTD failed 
to convert on the extra point.
The game continued with DTD 
blowing away KDR. In the second
Tartans dominate Bethany 
in third consecutive win
half, KDR had only one earned 
first down. In comparison, DTD 
had two earned first downs and 
fourtouchdowns. The game ended 
with DTD a 32-0 victor over KDR.
In major IM football action, 
squared off against Beta. Pika 
started the action with a six-play 
drive that ended with the ball 
being punted away. J.D. 
Heskamp, the Beta quarterback, 
started the Beta drive by throw­
ing an interception to Dominic 
“Spike" Ianno. Pika had another 
six-play drive that climaxed in a 
bad pass.
Beta started its second drive 
with a running play for a touch­
down, as Heskamp ran more than 
half the length of the field for 
Beta’s first six points. The extra 
point was good as Jeff Caringola 
threw a pass to Dan Crimmins. 
Pika’s third drive was cut short as 
Caringola intercepted a Paul Mer- 
cadante pass.
Beta capitalized on the inter­
ception seven plays later as Crim­
mins dove for and caught a 
Heskamp pass in the endzone. 
Crimmins caught the pass for the 
extra point and the first half ended 
with Beta up by 14 points over 
Pika.
The second half started with 
Ianno intercepting his second 
Heskamp pass of the day. Three 
plays later, Mercadante connected 
on a long bomb with Pete 
Malkemes for the first Pika touch­
down; the extra point was good. 
Beta then occupied the next five 
plays to score touchdown number 
three, a Heskamp to Rob Keller 
pass. The extra point was good on 
a pass from Heskamp to Carin­
gola.
The fourth quarter started with 
a Beta drive. Three plays into the 
drive, Ianno had his third inter­
ception. Pika took control of the 
ball and started its own drive. 
Three plays into the drive, Scott 
Damon, aBeta player, intercepted 
a Mercadante pass and ran it back 
for a touchdown.
The extra point attempt failed. 
Beta dominated the rest of the 
game, both offensively and defen­
sively, scoring its fifth touchdown 
on a Crimmins pass that was 
received by Keller.
The extra point failed again, 
but the game was essentially over. 
The last few minutes of the game 
quickly went by, leaving Pika as 
the loser in the conflict. The final 
was Beta 33, Pika 7.

Thiel surprises Lady Tartans in tourney
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
The women’s volleyball team was in 
for a surprise Saturday, as it hosted 
matches to Thiel College and Waynesburg 
College. Unsure of what would occur, the 
Lady Tartans soon discovered they didn’t 
like what Thiel had to show them. CMU 
lost the match to Thiel in two straight 
games.
Thiel kept the Lady Tartans guessing 
up until the match Saturday. “We hadn’t 
seen them yet this year,” said Coach 
Suzanne Flaherty, and the team didn’t 
know what to expect.
“We weren’t prepared for them,” said 
player Laurie Shumaker. “They only had 
two returning players from last year, and 
we expected to do better.”
Although the Lady Tartans thought 
Thiel was plagued by inexperience, CMU
actually has a problem in that department. 
“We have a lot of youngkids,” said Flaherty. 
“It’s going to take a while to gel.”
Lady Tartan Cindy Peperak was im­
pressed with Thiel’s performance. “I was 
really surprised,” she said. “They have some 
good hitters. They played really well.” 
According to Shumaker, Carnegie Mellon 
improved for the second game against Thiel, 
but couldn’t pull it together in time to win.
Flaherty agreed that the team had it 
moments. “We played well in spurts,” she 
said. “But we need to be consistent. We can’t 
spend all our time trying to play catch up.” 
“Catch up” was the name of the game 
against Waynesburg. Initially, CMU looked 
good enough to beat Waynesburg, but it 
couldn’tkeep going. “We were so good at the 
beginning,” said Peperak. “We had some 
really intense rallies, but then we just lost 
our level of intensity. We dropped off and I 
don’t know why.”
Unlike Thiel, the Lady Tartans knew 
Waynesburg would bea challenge, and after 
losing to Thiel, they knew they had their 
work cut out for them. “Weknew Waynesburg 
would be good,” said Shumaker. “We knew 
we had to play better, but we didn’t play well 
enough to win.” Waynesburg also defeated 
Carnegie Mellon in two straight games. In 
the Waynesburg/Thiel match, Waynesburg 
College was the victor.
Despite losing to Waynesburg, Peperak 
said the team was encouraged by its early 
performance in the match. “We proved we 
can play that well. Now we just have to do it 
more often,” she said. “Wehave the potential 
to be that good.” Flaherty believes the team 
is steadily improving with each game.
Thursday night, the Lady Tartans will 
once again face Waynesburg along with 
Washington and Jefferson.Coming in Octo­
ber is the University Athletic Association 
Tournamnent in Chicago.

scoreboard. The Tartans’ second 
drive of the half led to another 
touchdown — a 15 yard pass 
from Snyder to Schmitt pushed 
the lead to 28-0.
As the half progressed, Carne­
gie Mellon added two more scores: 
a Barnyak touchdown run and a 
Josh Hvisdos fumble recovery in 
the end zone.
The Tartans were also able to 
go down into the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth levels in the Carnegie Mel­
lon depth chart. “We dressed 95 
[players], and we probably played
90,” said Lackner.
There was one black mark on 
the day’s effort. Carnegie Mellon 
was penalized 13 times for 125 
yards.
This week: The Tartans take 
the week off before traveling to 
Schenectady, New York to take 
on the Dutchmen of Union Col­
lege.
According to Lackner, this is 
going to be an easy week for the 
team, allowing the players to get 
ready for midterms before prep- 
ping for the non conference oppo­
nent.
Field hockey disappointed 
in play against Bethany
By MERRY WILSON
'Tartan Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Field 
Hockey team turned in a score- 
less game against Bethany Col- 
; lege Tuesday, losing 2-0.
However, according to Denise 
Heisey, the score was not indica- 
tiveofthe Lady Tartans perform- 
ance.
¦ “Overall we played a good 
; game,” said Heisey. A poor first 
; half slowed down the team, she 
; said,butthesecondhalfsawmuch 
better playing from CMU. 
i Some good fast breaks from Lisa
Vandermeer and Becky Powers 
helped the Lady Tartans’ effort. 
Sue Moll and Heisey also turned 
in two good performances.
As the team moves along in the 
season, it takes something from 
each previous game into its next 
contest.
“By this time in the season, we 
are really beginning to play as a 
team,” said Heisey. “We are start­
ing to relate well and depend on 
each other.”
Today, the field hockey team 
travels to Slippery Rock, and then 
comes home for a Saturday match­
up with Juniata College.

The case for social wellness
In popular culture, the word "intimacy" conjures images of 
romantic, candlelit dinners involving just two people. It 
symbolizes a sharing process usually tied closely to sexuality.
But according to Cindy Sammons of Carnegie Mellon's 
Housing Office, "intimacy" is a state that students should seek 
to attain in a wide variety of relationships. Sammons, an area 
coordinator, is Housing's expert on the Wellness Model of 
development.
"Being socially 'well' involves a process of trusting," says 
Sammons. 'It's the ability to develop intimacy with a lot of 
different people — whether that be girlfriend/boyfriend, 
roommate, your RA, or maybe your boss."
The ability to develop intimacy isn't the only characteristic 
of the social portion of the Wellness Model, says Sammons. In 
addition to being able to express intimacy, Sammons thinks a 
student who wants to be socially well-developed has to learn to 
be comfortable in a wide range of relationships, tolerate 
differences in others, and cultivate a sense of responsibility to 
his or her community.
However, Sammons is cautious of assigning "stages" to 
wellness. "Human growth is continuous and cumulative," she 
says. "Wellness is sort of a process of self-awareness, but 
there's no end destination. It's ongoing."
According to the Wellness Model, says Sammons, people 
are "holistic organisms" — and if one portion of a student's life 
is underdeveloped, odds are that seemingly unrelated aspects 
of that person's life are suffering, too. "Certainly, you will not 
be at your best if one part of your life is out of whack," says 
Sammons.
Indeed, studies at other universities have shown that when 
students become involved in student activities, their grades 
generally improve. "Involvement equals connectedness," 
Sammons explains. "You're connected to the community of 
CMU."
Becoming connected to the community has results outside
— as well as inside — an individual student. "People have 
interdependent relationships," says Sammons, "and if you 
develop a sense of wellness, that will affect others in your 
community."

The Greek system; it’s not just 
for parties anymore
The thought came suddenly, a flash, a message burned 
across the sky. "I'll join a fraternity!" Then, a second later "Aw, 
what am I thinking. Yeah, right, join a fraternity. Uh huh, right 
after I go and get that tattoo this afternoon."
Has this ever happened to you? If so, you are one of many 
who have had this experience when considering the Greek 
system. Most students don't want to have the negative stigma 
asscoiated with Greek organizations attached to them. It stems 
from ideologies inherent in many cultural institutions. For 
example, nearly everyone has seen Animal House and, as a 
result, many believe that the words "fraternity" and "party" are 
synonymous. This presumption is not always the case. While it 
is true that CMU fraternities do hold parties of the type usually 
associated with Greek organizations, the scope of Greek 
activities is greater than simply parties. In addition to the social 
activities, Greeks hold activities which are not primarily social.
The Greek system at Carnegie Mellon is a dynamic 
institution, composed of 14 fraternities and five sororities. 
Unlike at most schools, the chapters at Carnegie Mellon do not 
own their own houses off campus. While this was once the 
case, the University now mandates that any Greek chapter 
wishing to remain active must use University-owned housing. 
Therefore, the fraternities are located in a quadrangle across 
from Morewood Gardens, and the sororities in houses above 
the Co-Op on Margaret Morrison Street. The only two 
exceptions are Sigma Tau Gamma, which operates out of A- 
tower of Doherty Apartments, and Alpha Epsilon Pi, which 
owns a house on Beeler Street.
Last year, approximately 30 percent of undergraduates 
belonged to a Greek organization — which is one of the highest 
involvement rates in the nation. Clearly, the Greek system is a 
powerful and active force on this campus.
Right now, the Greeks are most visible in their recruiting 
activities, known as rush. Undoubtedly most students are 
aware of the rush parties that have taken place every weekend, 
but there is more to rush than these parties. For sororities, rush 
is a highly organized event, during which all rushees register 
and visit each house. For fraternities, rush is less structured; 
unlike sorority rush, which lasts for only five days, fraternity 
rush lasts nearly a month. During a formal two week period 
known as dry rush, fraternities are not allowed to serve alcohol 
to rushees. Throughout rush, each house holds meetings at 
which its members decide who they will invite to join, and 
these invitations are known as bids. If a bidee chooses to join, 
then he or she will undergo a pledge period to learn about the 
house he or she has chosen. Pledging is also a kind of trial 
period — either the house or the bidee may cancel the 
arrangement.
The fact that the Greek system is the largest single 
philanthropic organization in the country is evident at Carnegie 
Mellon. You may have heard of Greek Sing, a competition 
within the fraternity and sorority systems at which short 
musical "shows" are presented. Last year Greek Sing raised 
$15,000 to help fight multiple sclerosis. Other events sponsored 
by Greek organizations to benefit MS include Kappa Alpha 
Theta's "Mr. Fraternity" contest, Theta Xi's "Basket Bucks" 
basketball tournament, and Delta Tau Delta's "Postman" party. 
Greek organizations also actively collect money for MS by 
street canning.
Of course, Spring Carnival would not be the same without 
booth and buggy, and here again, the Greek organizations are 
one of the most visible forces on campus. Students in the Greek 
system also have a higher average Q.P.A. than the average for 
the student body as a whole. Greeks actively support and 
participate in intramural athletics.
What else does it mean to be a Greek? Many Greeks feel 
that it provides them with an environment to grow, to develop 
leadership skills, and to learn about themselves.

Tips for handling stress
Excercise. Do aerobics, play tennis, join an intramural 
team.
Talk. Talk to a friend, ask for support, release tension. 
Relax. Take a break, take a shower, listen to music, make 
microwave brownies.
Religion. Go to church, temple or religious services. 
Change. Change your attitude. Listen to yourself when 
you're stressed out and change what you're thinking. 
Plan. Plan for stress—such as waiting in lines or waiting 
for people, or cramming for tests. You'll be better 
prepared.
( At George Washington University and other schools, 
students have set up a massage services. For 10 dollars, a 
student can get a massage and relieve stress!)

Avoiding roommate troubles
Roommate troubles for some students can be inevitable. 
Freshmen are commonly thought to have most of the problems 
because their roommates have been assigned by the school 
instead of chosen by them. However, even upperclassmen can 
have trouble with their roommates. The key to hashing out 
roommate troubles is by communication without offending 
anyone involved.
Nanu Trivedi, an RA in Morewood Gardens, has helped 
many students in resolving conflicts with their roommates. He 
suggests an open forum. Each student living in the room would 
make a list of things that bother him or her about the other 
roommates, without mentioning specific names or instances. 
Then all the roommates exchange lists and hopefully get an 
idea of what each person does that bothers the others. But 
Nanu warns that it isn't good to let tensions build up to the 
point where one roommate explodes and the other asks,
"Where did this come from?" "It's also helpful," one student 
says, "to express your needs in a positive manner. For 
example, I was trying to read when my suitemate came in and 
sat down on my bed. I talked to her for a few minutes and then 
told her that it had been nice talking to her but I really had to 
get my work done." In this way, the message was conveyed 
without hurting anyone's feelings.
Sometimes personalities clash and all the politeness and 
communication in the world won't solve the problem. If you 
can't work out the differences between you and your 
roommate, don't despair — there are things you can do. You 
can put a request for a room change in to the Housing Office, 
located on the first floor as you enter Morewood Gardens. 
However, don't simply wait for them to act. The Housing 
Office is not only very busy, but often has a hard time finding 
an empty room to move you into. It is a good idea to look 
around on your own, as well as putting in your request. Ask 
your friends. One group of students did a three way room 
switch — one person from each room moved. Everyone 
wound up happy in the end. Housing won't come up with 
solutions like that, but a group of students acting independent 
of the Housing Office will.

How to torture your roommate
Problems arise because two people with different needs are 
sharing what is usually a small space. I may need to study and 
my roommate may need to blow off steam. By asking around I 
came up with some things that roommates did which irritated 
students. Do you do any of these? Does your roommate get 
irritated by it? Maybe you should ask him or her.

Take the right step — dance
If you not only want to stay in shape, but also want to learn 
greater body control, taking structured dance classes is a great 
way to go. Like other forms of exercise, you can see quickly and 
easily your progression and development in terms of strength 
and stamina. However, dance allows you to express your own 
feelings and creativity through the activity itself and the music. 
For this reason, dance has mental and emotional benefits as 
well as physical ones. Classes are taught here at school through 
both the Music and Drama Departments. However, students in 
other departments may find it easier to get into classes offered 
from any of a number of schools and studios in the area. The 
Dance Alloy, Pittsburgh Dance Council, and even the 
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre can help you find classes at an 
appropriate level of challenge.
• Ballet—Most people think of ballet as just a bunch of 
women in tutus and men in tights. Athletes all over the world, 
including pro-football players, have recognized the benefits of 
studying ballet. It teaches you how to use the muscles you have 
and how to make those muscles stronger and more flexible. 
Strength without flexibility is useless. In addition, the music in 
ballet class is a bit more relaxing and therapeutic than the fast 
beat of an aerobics class; in ballet the emphasis is on body 
control and body discipline, not sweat.
•Jazz—Don't get confused, jazz dance is not aerobics with 
a twist. Jazz, like ballet, emphasizes complete body control. The 
difference between it and ballet is that the movements, and 
certainly the music, are a bit more modem and progressive 
than ballet. Some of the best jazz classes incorporate actual 
choreography with the study of technique. Even if you are not a 
performer, going through the process of learning a dance 
routine can teach you about muscle discipline, control, and 
even your sense of musical perception. All this while keeping 
you in shape and healthy.
•Tap—Tap differs from the other forms of dance in that it 
concentrates more on the feet and legs than on the body as a 
whole. For this reason, more people are more easily suited for 
tap than for the more physically demanding dance styles of 
ballet and jazz.
If you can walk, you can tap. There are basic steps in tap 
that are layered on top of each other in different combinations 
which allow for complex routines. Anyone can learn these steps 
in a few short classes and begin to get really creative right 
away. As with all dance, coordination is a benefit of, not a 
prerequisite for tap.

IM sports relieve stress
"The intramural program provides students, faculty and staff 
with the opportunity to enjoy organized sports ... to meet people 
from all departments, and most importantly to get a necessary 
break from the academic world."
— Pat Jeffries, intramural board president
Carnegie Mellon is, by nature, a demanding school. It 
seems that each year there is more work and less time to 
do it in. I suppose that after a few years one begins to 
cultivate certain habits which help to make things go, if 
not a little easier, then perhaps a little better. While many 
students find academic work the end-all and be-all of 
existence at Carnegie Mellon, others have discovered a 
way of blowing off steam which could otherwise build up 
to potentially dangerous levels, given the workload. The 
refuge many have found is Intramurals.
Available activities include chess, bowling, volleyball, 
bridge, fencing, frisbee and wrestling. Obviously, the 
activities are geared to providing students with a chance 
to play games they might otherwise not be able to because 
it takes precious time and energy to get them up and 
running. Since the IM board takes care of signing up times 
and places, all you have to worry about is getting your 
name on the lists for activities you would like to play.
Many people are already signed up and playing in IM 
teams. I have taken part in volleyball tournaments and 
found the time well spent. Chances are that someone you 
know is on an IM team. Ask around and get a feel for 
what is popular and why. If you wish to get a team going 
you can probably convince enough of your friends to join. 
And awards like trophies and medals are presented to all 
IM champions.
To find out what activities are available, stop by room
101 in the gym and pick up some of the brochures which 
list vital statistics for the available pursuits. It will be well 
worth your time, and may well save your sanity a few 
times in the coming years.

Enjoy safe sex
As college students, we are becoming independent, adult 
individuals quite able to make our own decisions and explore 
our morals and lifestyles. The ultimate exploration of all, into 
the mystery of human sexuality, is an issue we shall all deal 
with throughout life. f
Magazines, books, and movies contemplate the obscure 
power and emotion associated witli sex. However, all the 
movies ybu may see will not give you earth-shattering clues 
into the sexual mystique. Neither will this article, but it will 
give you some answers about how to play it safe.
Sexual intercourse is uniquely personal, therefore each 
individual values it differently. Ultimately, it should bring each 
partner a sense of happiness and satisfaction, while still 
maintaining a healthy balance with other aspects of life. This 
delicate balance can be disrupted by a myriad of things from 
disease to an unwanted pregnancy, but practicing safe sex is 
the surest way to maintain this balance.
Playing it safe doesn't mean eliminating sex from your life. 
It means being smart and staying healthy. It's your body, and 
you need to take care of it. Anyone who is sexually active, 
whether it be heterosexually or homosexually, needs to be 
informed.
Most sexually transmitted diseases are spread by germs 
moving from one person to another. Bodily fluids such as 
semen, blood, menstrual blood, urine, feces, and possibly saliva 
are known to be carriers of the AIDS virus, the hepatitis-B 
virus, chlamydia, and bacteria-causing gonorrhea and syphilis. 
You can limit this spread of disease during sex by wearing a 
condom.

AIDS prevention
There is no evidence that AIDS can be transmitted by casual 
contact. Some activities are more dangerous than others. Some 
early symptoms of AIDS are excessive tiredness, recurring 
fevers, persistent cough, extreme weight loss, swollen glands, 
sore throat, blotchy skin, or bruising easily. These symptoms are 
similar to those of common minor illnesses, but differ in 
severity and duration.
1. Be smart about sexual activity and talk to your partners 
about safe sexual practices. Know your partner's sexual history 
and health.
2. Use condoms during sex. See "DOs and DON'Ts of 
condom use."
3. Avoid injury to body tissues during sex. Contact with 
open sores, exchanging body fluids such as urine and blood, 
and oral/anal contact are very risky.
4. The use of alcohol and recreational drugs impair your 
judgement and weaken your immune system.
5. Sharing needles or using intravenous drugs is extremely 
risky.
photo by Kishor Rao
DOs and DON’Ts of condom use
DO always use latex condoms; the virus responsible for 
AIDS can penetrate natural lambskin condoms.
DO use only water soluble lubricants like KY Jelly or 
spermicides; petroleum-based lubricants like Vaseline and 
Crisco weaken the latex.
DO store condoms away from heat and pressure. Glove 
compartments of cars and wallets are not good places to 
store condoms. Condoms have expiration dates; be sure to 
check the date.
DO roll the condom as soon as the penis is erect, before 
intercourse begins.
DO hold the tip of the condom as you unroll it onto the 
penis (this will leave space for semen to collect).
DO hold the condom on at the base when withdrawing 
following ejaculation so that leakage does not occur.
DO use a condom only once and then throw it away.
Use of a spermicide that contains Nonoxynol-9 in addition 
to a latex condom affords you better protection.

Shaping values: Looking outward and inward
\kâr-neg'-Æ\
26 September 1989
page 4
Do you ever wonder about why we are here? Or what the 
purpose of life is? Is there a Greater Being? There is a side to 
each of us that wonders what is beyond the physical world. Or 
if indeed anything is. Spirituality is not simply religion, but our 
outlook on life, our prejudices, and moral values.
As students get older, they are exposed to more and more 
new ideas. Moral judgements and sets of values are continually 
challenged by different views. Many students are awakening 
from a sheltered high school life. Some will completely reject 
the ideas taught by their parents; others will cling to those ideas 
as a firm sanctuary. And still others weren't taught anything by 
their parents and must form opinions from their experience in 
society. For most students, though, it is a combination of the 
rejection of some ideas and the acceptance of others that shape 
spiritual beliefs.
As Rabbi Joseph Levine, who has had 25 years of 
experience with college students and religion, said, "You 
synthesize what you have been taught and reintegrate this into 
an ongoing adult life." Rabbi Joe hopes students won't 
automatically reject the value system they grew up in. "Just as 
[students] owe themselves the responsibility to look outward, 
they can look inward at the same time."
Do many students break away from organized religion? A 
lot of students do find that conventional religious structures 
don't address their needs of expression. This feeling presents 
the biggest challenge to religious leaders working on college 
campuses. They must find ways to make tradition part of 
college life. This task is not an easy one. Campus ministries 
have to bridge organized religion and the spiritual sensitivity of 
the student, without the two clashing. Another misconception 
that religious leaders are up against is that organized religion is 
only interested in self-perpetuation. Says Rabbi Joe, "Like any 
institution it has its ups and downs, but inside the structures 
are the values [students] may be seeking." Religion is the type 
of thing you have to really explore in order to find any meaning 
or significance. It is not apparent on the surface. It is an option 
to help us answer some of the big questions we may have.
This exploration of spirituality is not always directly seen 
by the ministries. "Sometimes a student's spiritual community 
may be three or four friends with whom he or she feels 
comfortable talking about these tilings," says Rabbi Joe. 
Spiritual groups on campus have been much more attuned to 
student attitudes in recent years. They realize some students 
fear that they'll get lost in a big impersonal group. Other 
students are afraid to make any kind of commitment. The 
ministries have been focusing on just being available to 
students. There are no "price tags" attached to attending a 
meeting. They won't ask you to come every week or look down 
on you if you're not active. One common goal of many of the 
campus groups is to find "creative ways of tapping into all that 
inner thinking that's going on," says Rabbi Joe.
A student trend during the sixties and seventies was a 
rebellion from the structure of religion. People would sit 
around on barstools and intellectualize about life and that 
would consist of a religious ceremony.
Today, Rabbi Joe sees more and more students enjoying the 
traditions of religion. They like the concrete symbols of religion, 
and want the "touch and feel of religious experience." Many 
people strive to reach that unknown through physical actions 
like lighting sabbath candles, or receiving communion.
Some people, however, do not want to search for the 
"answers" through religion. Spirituality does not necessarily 
involve religion. It is "what your ethics are," says Cindy 
Sammons, housing area coordinator. She says it is "how you 
feel you fit in with the universe in a way." Even students who 
are agnostic, atheist, or anything else, still have a spiritual side. 
They must still make choices throughout their lives based on a 
set of values. Sammons cited the example of a minister at a 
Unitarian church who did not believe in God, but still followed 
a code of goodness, beauty and truth. As Sammons says, it's 
"who you are and how you're going to deal with situations that 
you'll face."

How to care for your cold
What causes the common cold?
The common cold — runny or stuffy nose, scratchy throat, 
sneezing, watery eyes, dry cough — is caused by a virus.
How do I "catch" a cold?
Colds are not easy to catch. Colds are usually transmitted 
by airborne droplets and hand contact.
You are also likely to come in contact with a cold virus in 
places where large numbers of people are confined in a small 
area for a long time, such as a classroom or dormitory.
If you cannot avoid contact, washing your hands frequently 
and keeping your fingers away from your eyes and nose may 
help. If you do have a cold, help keep it to yourself by carefully 
disposing of tissues and by not sharing towels, glasses, or 
eating utensils. Cover your mouth and nose when you sneeze. 
Why do I seem to have so many colds when my friend hasn't 
had one for years?
Your susceptibility to colds depends on your overall well­
being and which and how many antibodies you have. Getting 
chilled or wet does not make you more likely to get a cold.
Will I have more colds if I smoke?
You may not have more colds if you smoke, but the ones 
you do catch are likely to be more severe than they would be if 
you did not smoke.
Cold Care
The only treatment for viral illnesses is symptomatic care. 
Cold and "flu" are viral illnesses and tend to last one to two 
weeks. The duration is not affected by medication. To help 
relieve the symptoms of cold or "flu," we make the following 
recommendations:
1. Rest when you feel tired. Don't push yourself.
2. Drink as many de-caffeinated fluids as possible.
3. Refrain from smoking.
4. Dress appropriately tor the weather.
5. Use a vaporizer or humidifier to increase moisture in the 
environment. Set pans of water on the radiator.
• For Sore Throats
1. Use salt water gargles, 1/2 teaspoon salt in 8 to 10 ounces 
of hot water every 3 to 4 hours.
2. If you wish, use throat lozenges or hard candy between 
gargles to soothe and moisten your throat.
3. Avoid gargling with prepared mouthwash; use only a 
mild salt solution.
•For Coughs
1. Robitussin DM may help to lessen the cough.
2. Increase fluid intake.
•For Stuffy Noses
1. Use a vaporizer or humidifier to increase moisture in the 
environment. Set pans of water on the radiator.
2. Take decongestants as ordered. Check with medical 
personnel before taking decongestants if you have elevated 
blood pressure.
Antihistamines, which are contained in most over-the 
counter cold preparation, will make you drowsy and may have 
a drying effect on the mucus which may be undesirable. 
Sudafed and Oranyl are decongestants only and contain no 
antihistamines.
•For Fever, Headaches, and Muscle Pain
1. Tylenol: two tablets every 4 hours as needed, or 
Ibuprofen 200 mg: two tablets every 6 hours as needed.
If over the age of 25, you may use aspirin: two tablets every 
4 hours as needed.
Points to Ponder
1. Penicillin and other antibiotics are of no value in 
treatment of colds, coughs, and sore throats caused by viruses.
2. If you do have "strep" throat, your culture will be 
positive and you will be notified to return for penicillin or 
appropriate medication if you are allergic to penicillin.
3. If the following symptoms develop, call the Student 
Health Services: fever over 102 degrees Farenheit; coughing up 
yellow, green, brown or blood tinged sputum; or earaches, face 
pain, chest pain, or shortness of breath.
4. "Cold" not improving or worsening after ten days.

Staying healthy
How can students keep themselves totally safe from the 
diseases which are passed around in a college environment? 
According to CMU Student Health Service staff nurse Linda 
Hadlow, 'They can't."
Aspects of college life, such as dormitory living and large 
classes, which bring a lot of people close together, facilitate the 
transmission of diseases like strep throat, colds, the flu, and 
mononucleosis.
To preventing the spread of mononucleosis, for example, 
wash with soap and hot water glasses or eating utensils shared 
with people who have mono. Glasses and utensils should also 
be dried well because mono is spread through moist saliva.
Although Hadlow says that "if a disease is airborne and 
you're living with someone in the same room, you're probably 
going to be exposed," she explains that exposure does not 
necessarily mean that you will become sick. Some people have 
higher immunities to various diseases than others.
Being used to an area helps increase immunity because 
different areas of the country and different communities have 
different diseases. Thus, upperclassmen who have been 
exposed to the diseases common at Carnegie Mellon are less 
likely to become sick than freshmen who have not yet 
encountered the diseases indigenous to the area.
Students would remain healthier if they ate and slept 
better, according to Hadlow. She advises students to eat 
balanced meals and to avoid bad eating habits such as skipping 
breakfast, eating sporadically, and eating snacks throughout 
the day rather than regular meals.
"You'll be able to tell whether you are eating enough by 
your weight," says Hadlow. "If you have a weight drop, you'll 
know you're not eating enough." This "weight factor" is 
especially true in young people, she says.
Even if students' weights remain steady, they should be 
conscious of what types of food they eat to make sure they are 
getting a balanced diet. Students should avoid junk food, 
according to Hadlow, and should be careful about fast food, 
although it can sometimes be healthy.
The amount of sleep students need varies, Hadlow says.
She says that staying up all night can be bad for students' 
health, especially when they are already sick, since it can lead 
to secondary infections such as strep.
Students run into a particular problem when they are 
recovering from an illness because they often have have extra 
work to complete before they are completely healthy. Hadlow 
says that students should try to pace themselves and not allow 
themselves to get too exhausted. 'That's the hard part," she 
says. "And that's what frustrates people."

How to get your body back on track
fWktm
Schedules, classes, appointments, parties, and hours of 
work once again surround us. With another semester 
beginning, our bodies are thrown into activities full of stress, no 
sleep, malnutrition, and lack of time for exercise. Some of us 
may think this is ideal. Others, after a healthy summer of sun, 
exercise, and relaxation, may find themselves thrown out of 
whack. Here are some helpful tips to get back on track.
If your goal is to gain weight, you've come to the right 
place. College life introduces us to a world of high fats, sweets, 
and salty foods. This may seem like heaven at first, but your 
body will soon tell you that you need nutrients and exercise to 
keep going. Allowing yourself to indulge in these sinful foods 
is okay once in a while, but to build up energy, you need 
calcium, protein, vitamins, and carbohydrates. You may have 
overlooked them, but you can find healthy foods in CMU's 
cafeterias. Salads Plus offers a good selection of salads, but 
avoid the desserts and trail mix. Kiltie Cafe and Morewood 
Gardens also have salad bars. Tartan Grill and MorePizza serve 
salads to go, as well as fruit, and yogurt. Salads with lots of 
dressing and toppings, however, are not necessarily healthy 
Exercise is a great way to stay fit and relieve stress. You 
may think that you have no time to exercise, but you probably 
just haven't found the type of exercise you enjoy to get yourself 
motivated. Anything from walking, running, swimming, 
aerobics, bicycling, weight lifting, and frisbee are all good ways 
to stay fit; all are available at CMU.
The best routes for walking, running and biking are along 
the paths in Schenley Park. Go with a friend or during the 
daytime when the park is safer. If you run roads, stay on Forbes 
or Fifth where the lights and traffic offer some measure of 
personal safety; if you like track work, try Schenley Oval.
If you are interested in registering for aerobics classes, you 
must purchase a membership card at the gym. Registration is 
open Monday to Friday, from 9 am to 4 pm. Classes cost:
4 times a week for 1 semester=50 classes=$25.00
3 times a week for 1 semester=37 classes=$ 18.50
2 times a week for 1 semester=25 classes=$12.50 
You must bring your card with you to class or you will not 
be allowed in. The schedule of classes is:
\kar-neg -€\ Morewood: Monday to Friday, 5:15 pm; Monday to
26 September 1989 Thursday, 6:30 pm; Saturday and Sunday, 5 pm.
page 12 Morrison's: Monday to Friday, 5:15 pm.
Mats are supplied, but you must bring your own towel. 
If swimming is the exercise for you, the pool is located in 
the gym. Pool hours are:
Mon:7:15 to 8:15am,11:30amto 1:15 pm, 7 to 9pm.
Tues:7:15 to 8:15am,11:30amto 1:30 pm, 7 to 9pm.
Wed:7:15 to 8:15am,11:30amto 1:15 pm, 7 to 9pm.
Thurs:7:15 to 8:15am,11:30amto 1:30 pm, 7 to 9pm.
Fri:7:15 to 8:15am,12:30to 1:15 pm, 7 to 9 pm
Sat:1 to 4 pm.
Sun:1 to 4 pm, 7to 91 pm.
Also located in the gym is a weight room with machines 
and free weights and body shop with stationary bikes. The 
Caber Club is a Nautilus club that offers student rates for 
membership. It is located on Margaret Morrison Street, and its 
phone number is 268-8876.
For those looking for fun ways to exercise in the cold 
months ahead, Schenley Park offers outdoor ice-skating adn 
cross-country skiing. You can also rent skates there. About an 
hour away, Seven Springs and Hidden valley ski resorts are fun 
places to go skiing. They're open weekdays, weekends, and 
have night skiing.
Sleep is a very precious thing at CMU. After hours of work, 
our bodies begin to crave it. Your body needs a good amount of 
rest each day, but many times it is impossible to get any sleep 
at all. If you can avoid pulling an all-nighter, do so. If you 
absolutely must stay up until dawn, here are some tips to keep 
awake:
•Don't try to pull an all-nighter alone. Find someone who 
is also planning a full night of work together so you can keep 
each other awake.
•Don't try to work straight through the night. Take short 
breaks every hour or so.
•Don't panic. If the project is due tomorrow, don't start 
counting down how many hours you have left. Panicking 
wastes your time and energy.
•Caffeine is a must. Take coffee breaks or have a stack of 
quarters ready for the soda machine.
•Don't eat rich, sweet foods. Sugary foods will pep you up 
fast, but eventually make you sleepier and nauseated as the 
hours creep on.

A Guided Tour through Career Services
You might have a lot of questions about what your goals 
are and what you should do here to achieve them. You may be 
wondering if you want to go on to graduate school. You might 
want to know how or where to get a job or internship in your 
field. That's where the Career Center, in the basement of 
Warner Hall, comes in. It offer career counseling and placement 
services, a link between college and the next step after the 
degree, whatever it might be.
Career counseling is commonly regarded as a service just 
for students who have no idea what they want to do. This is not 
the case. Career counseling is also for students who want to be 
sure about their career choices, or who want to investigate 
other fields. Once a student comes to the office and makes an 
appointment to see a career counselor, the process begins.
Karen Litzinger, the associate director of career counseling, 
handles the counseling along with another counselor who takes 
about nine appointments a week. The first meeting is simply 
an informal discussion with Litzinger about what you'd like to 
find out about your interests, goals, opportunities that are open 
to you, and even options that you may have overlooked or 
dismissed as unrealistic. Once you've established what you 
want to know, you may find it useful to take one of three 
surveys available through the office. The surveys are the Strong 
Interest Inventory, the Career Ability Placement Survey, and 
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The most commonly used 
test, according to Litzinger, is the Strong Interest Inventory.
"It's one of the most respected in the field," Litzinger said.
The Strong Interest Inventory concentrates on self­
exploration and covers a variety of activities and areas of study. 
Responses are compared with the answers given by people 
who are satisfied with their careers, and the similarities 
between your answers and answers of people who enjoy their 
jobs are measured. The Career Ability Placement Survey is new 
to the office, only added to the program this summer. It's an 
aptitude test which matches the areas in which high ability is 
shown to corresponding majors and careers. The Myers-Briggs 
Type Indicator, familiar to some as the roommate compatibility 
survey given by the Housing Office, is more geared toward 
understanding what makes you unique and what kind of career 
you might find satisfying.
Of course, the results from these tests are not intended to be 
strict guidelines informing you of the career you should 
pursue; they are but one way to correct some misconceptions 
you may have about certain careers. There are also skill and 
values assessments you can take, less formal methods of 
targeting the skills you have and deciding what's important to 
you.
The next step, after having taken one of the three surveys, 
is to schedule one to three hour-long follow-up meetings with 
the counselor to discuss the results and learn about the Career 
Resource Library. It is located in the Career Center and has 
books on almost every aspect of a career search, information 
ranging from how to decide on a career that's right for you to 
help in interview skills. It also has indexes to fellowship 
information and application forms for graduate exams like the 
GRE and the LSAT. Four books available in the library that are 
highly recommended are What Color Is Your Parachute: the 1989 
Edition, Discover What You're Best At, Career Decisions: Strategies 
for Enrichment, and Do What You Love and The Money Will Follow. 
Some of the books in the library can be signed out.
The placement services offered by the Career Center 
include summer placement for undergraduates and permanent 
employment for seniors and graduate students. In order to 
participate in on-campus interviewing and in the referral 
service, and to be included in the resume books, all students 
have to fill out a registration form. The forms are available in 
the office and must be returned with 20 copies of your resume.
Seniors and graduate students who register can sign up to 
interview with employers who come to campus looking for
students in their majors and with their degrees. Openings are 
posted Mondays and Thursdays at noon, and students can start 
signing up at 8 am the following day. Many interviews are now 
prescreened. Dennis Ryan, director of the Career Center, cited 
prescreening as a "new and growing recruiting technique 
among employers." By his estimation, about eight to nine 
hundred students participate in this process, which lasts from 
the month of October until April. Employers who inform the 
office about vacancies, but who don't come to campus, receive 
resumes of students who fill their requirements through the 
referral service. The resume books are located in the office, and 
employers coming to campus use them to find qualified 
students for on-campus interviewing or contact for future 
vacancies.
The office also offers services that don't require that you 
become registered with the office to take advantage of them. 
Placement counseling is one, and it gives you an opportunity to 
talk to a placement counselor about how to find a job, and how 
to improve your interviewing skills and resume. There's also a 
credential service, in which the student establishes a file with 
the office which can contain transcripts, letters of 
recommendation, and other useful documents. The idea is that 
you can request that the office send copies of your file to 
prospective employers, graduate schools, or anywhere you 
would like.
The office sponsors a lot of activities which can provide 
you with the same information and help you would receive in 
the office in a group atmosphere. The workshops can offer an 
opportunity for you to learn about elements of the career search 
with other students who have the same questions. Information 
about these workshops and other services the office provides is 
available at the office.

'The Forum" is an opportunity for those interested in 
human relations and cultural sensitivity offered to all members 
of the campus community. 'The Forum," started by Acting 
Dean of Student Affairs Mike Murphy, and H&SS senior Lara 
Kovacic, is a weekly dinner meeting.
The program provides a relaxed environment, and gives 
people the opportunity to feel comfortable in sharing their own 
personal views. As Murphy says, "It's an opportunity to get 
together and talk about important issues."
A successful comparable program last semester attracted 50 
to 60 people for each activity. This year it has met with the 
same success, allowing for small group discussions in addition 
to presentations, speakers, and other activities. The programs 
deal with a wide variety of subjects including: cultural, social, 
occupational, spiritual, sexual, physical, intellectual, and 
emotional issues.
The purpose of The Forum is twofold. The main goal is 
increased awareness of human relations and cultural 
sensitivity, but the program also has an educational focus. For 
example, last week's Forum dealt with the student unrest in 
China. Towards the end of the program the attendees broke up 
into small group discussions in order to develop further 
insights on the subject.
The Forum has a wide variety of issues planned for the 
semester. This week's forum is on interfaith awareness and 
understanding. It focuses on the risks and rewards of religious 
diversity, and it explores ways to overcome barriers created by 
this diversity. Other upcoming issues include: a discussion of 
human relations and the cross-cultural community, social 
segregation, the Middle East planned on United Nations Day 
(Oct. 24); sex in the 90s; and finally a program examining 
campus resources in general entitled "Accessing the Academy."
The Forum invites topics that will continue to allow human 
relations and cultural diversity to encompass as broad a 
definition as possible. The Forum also welcomes and sponsors 
anyone with a new topic for a program. One can contact the 
Acting Dean of Student Affairs Mike Murphy about any ideas. 
To find out about attending The Forum, call Student Affairs at

New Learning Services Center 
provides a helping hand
Though still in its infancy stage, a new service under 
Director Marcia Wratcher on campus is assisting students with 
the process of learning.
The Learning Services Center has already implemented its 
first project this year. Over the course of the past year, a group 
whose members included faculty, students, and administrators 
developed a menu of several activities which would work as 
academic support programs. These activities are designed to 
help incoming freshmen adjust to the academic setting of 
Carnegie Mellon. Individual colleges or departments can select 
a menu item and have special customized versions installed by 
the Center for that particular group of students. Two 
departments, Music and Engineering, have already enacted 
such tailored programs.
The Learning Services Center also provides a valuable 
resource for Carnegie Mellon students with learning 
disabilities. The Center acts as a liason between the student 
and the university, talking with instructors and making 
accomodations so that the learning disabled student has the 
opportunity to learn, as well as explore his or her own 
potential.
Students with more general study problems will also be 
assisted by the Center. If a student is having difficulty in a 
class feels the problem is of an academic nature, he or she can 
go to the Center and complete a study skills survey to 
determine his or her strengths and weaknesses. From there the 
student will be directed one of two ways. First, four help 
workshops will be held later this semester, each concentrating 
on a separate issue of study habits: lecture note-taking, time 
management, preparing for final exams, and reducing test 
anxiety. Second, individual tutors will be available by early 
October to provide more individual assistance. The Learning 
Services Center plans to continue throughout the year to work 
as a resource for student problems involving the learning 
process.

Academic doors are open for you
Carnegie Mellon is preparing you for your future. It is 
teaching fundamentals that you are going to call upon again 
and again as you go through your career and life. And 
hopefully, at the end of four years hopefully, you will be ready 
to face either the world or graduate school.
As daunting as this fact may be, it is one that every student 
faces. Questions will arise such as, "What do I want to do?" or 
"Why am I doing so badly in a course that is a core requirement 
for my major?" These questions are asked not only by those 
who have had problems academically in the past, but also by 
students who have excelled.
Fortunately, Carnegie Mellon realizes that things can be 
difficult and may even seem impossible at times. In response, 
two related yet distinct programs have been set up. One is the 
Academic Tutoring program and another is the Academic 
Advisory program.
You may already know something about the tutoring 
program: there are posters around campus listing courses, 
times, and locations for sessions. Several groups are running 
tutoring programs concurrently, each addressing a certain need 
in the community. There are differences in the core 
requirements for the colleges and, accordingly, varying sessions 
are available.
Some think of tutoring as being a chance to make up for the 
loss of personal interaction between teacher and student. 
Programs also stress more abstract and generic points such as 
note or exam taking as well as topics specific to a given course.
Tutoring for specific courses, such as Calculus I, is usually 
done by TAs or students who excelled in that class. They are 
paid and trained to give effective advice. Other tutoring topics 
may be run outside of specific classes, such as the H&SS 
writing tutorials. When it started, this program was taught by a 
graduate student the H&SS department employed, rather than 
TAs from specific writing courses.
The Academic Advisory Program is designed to help 
students sign up for courses, examine their desires and abilities, 
and plan their futures. Students prepare resume, send them out 
to appropriate employers, adn pursue summer internships. If 
you don't know what you want or where you are going, you 
will find it difficult to take advantage of such events as on- 
campus interviews.
The advisory program has been set up to take college 
idiosyncrasies into account. For example, H&SS students have 
two years of core courses before they enter their selected 
majors. MCS and CIT students have one year of core. CFA has 
none: students select majors when they apply to Carnegie 
Mellon and jump right in in their freshman year.
Tutoring helps with the here-and-now of passing classes, 
while Academic Advising helps with preparing for what is to 
come after college. If you believe you could benefit from the 
programs, take some time out from your schedule to get some 
back-up. These programs are there for you.

| the Respect Program focuses oh 
1 improving services through un- 
; derstanding. During an orienta- 
; tion for the Respect Program, 181 
! out of 340 employees viewed films 
¡and held discussions on how to 
! improve their services. They put 
1 themselves in the customer’s 
i position and determined what 
| lands of services people want.
; The goal of the Respect Pro- 
¡gram is to make Dining Services 
¡a little bit better for everyone. 
¡But it’s a two way street: as a 
¡customer, you can’t expect it to 
work for you without considering 
¡your own attitudes. When an 
¡employee smiles at you, it couldn’t 
;hurt to smile back. Instead of 
¡saying, “Gimme large fries!”, you 
¡might say, “I’d like an order of
large fries please.”
Employees of Dining Service 
also have good things to say about 
the program. Althea Martin, a 
worker at Kiltie says “[the pro­
gram helps us to understand what 
the customer feels.” Larry Stitt, 
another worker in Kiltie says “I 
think it's well needed. It's about 
time. It's great.”
Mary Parhetta, a manager at 
Kiltie, thinks that the program 
has really improved how things 
run at Kiltie. “I think [the new 
program] gives the employees 
more pride in their work. It 
teaches that the customers are 
the boss.” According to Parhetta, 
the new program has also encour­
aged the workers to get more 
involved in their work. The pro­
gram also encourages teamwork
and communication among the 
workers.
If you don’t like the food, you 
can leave a message in the sug­
gestion box explaining clearly 
what you didn’t like.
Even if you don’t realize it, the 
food is prepared by people who 
care about you and the food that 
they make. It’s also okay to leave 
thank you notes and messages of 
appreciation in the suggestion 
box.
In the second week of October, 
Dining Services will distribute 
about 500 surveys and announce 
their first Employee of the Month. 
They hope that you will take the 
time to fill out . the survey and 
they ask you to be sure to con­
gratulate the Employee of the 
Month.

For Dining Services’ Respect Program to work, patrons and employees must open active channels of 
communication through which they can improve the system.

Have you ever faced serious 
«motional or academic difficul­
ties, and wondered where to turn? 
^The Counseling and Student De­
velopment Center, located in 
Morewood Gardens, provides stu­
dents with a place to go for help.
! Dr. Lorrie Rabin, the Center di­
rector, said that last year about 
910 students and 30 groups took 
advantage of the center’s serv­
ices. “Some people come when 
fchings just don’t feel right,” she 
fcaid. “Sometimes they feel down, 
anxious, or just confused....”
Students can call the Center to 
make an appointment with a 
counselor. Appointments last 
from half an hour to an hour, 
during which the counselor works 
y/ith the student to determine 
Jvhat kind of help the student 
tnay need.
Some students come for short 
term counseling (two to eight ses­
sions); most stay for full-term 
counseling (twelve sessions). The 
counselor can also refer the stu­
dent to long-term counseling with 
a specialist. According to a sur­
vey taken by the office last sum­
mer, most of the students who 
went to the center last year went 
because of problems with a rela­
tionship. Other reasons which 
were frequently given were aca­
demic difficulties, family prob­
lems, difficulty with sexual pref­
erence, and eating disorders.
Most people know the Counsel­
ing and Student Development 
Center for its Walk-In Tutoring 
Program. Tutoring in calculus, 
physics, chemistry, biology, aca­
demic writing, and introduction 
to computing is given five nights 
a week. Private tutoring for indi­
viduals and groups is also avail­
able through the center. Those
who are interested can call to 
make an appointment with a 
tutor; the cost is determined by 
the tutor. Along with these serv­
ices, a new program will be avail­
able for students who need help 
with general study skills. There 
are four students who are in train­
ing to run study skills classes on 
improving note-taking skills and 
time management.
The Coimseling and Student 
Development Center also con­
ducts several training programs 
and workshops. Two large organi­
zations in the center are CADE 
and HANDS. Sandra Kreider 
heads both organizations, which 
address the problems of drug and 
alcohol abuse on campus. Some 
other programs and workshops 
provdided by the office are RA 
training, the CFA wellness pro­
gram last Thursday, and work­
shops on issues like stress man­
agement and eating disorders.
Most of the programs offered by 
the center are offered in conjunc­
tion with other offices on campus 
like the Student Health Center 
and Career Services. “We get a 
better turnout,” says Rabin.
The Counseling and Student 
Development Center is open 
Monday through Friday, and of­
fers walk-in hours from 3 to 5 pm. 
One of the counselors keeps these 
hours free each day for students
who feel that they need immedi­
ate counseling. Anyone calling the 
office after 5 or during the week­
end will get an answering service 
which can reach any of the coun­
selors at any time.

I believe that man is an in­
trinsically optimistic creature.
How else could we explain the 
phenomenon oftrans-continential 
airplane travel? Who else but the 
greatest Polyanna in the universe 
could have come up with the in­
credibly life-affirming idea of man 
spreading his own steel wings and 
transcending the natural barri­
ers which surround him?
The sad truth is that, in pursu­
ing such grandiose schemes, it is 
all very easy for man to lose sight 
of the fact that this enterprise 
will entail jamming three hundred 
people who do not necessarily like 
one another into seats which 
appear to have been designed for 
spineless quadruple amputees 
who have undergone starvation 
diets and tossing them about like 
lounge lizards at a feminist con­
vention for eight or so hours.
First of all, it is my opinion that 
there should be a much stricter 
limit as to the age of airplanes al­
lowed to fly, regardless of how 
air-worthy they may be (by the 
way, it’s not difficult to tell the 
older jets apart—just look for the 
puce and purple furnishings and 
the “modern” designs on the 
walls).
The reasons for this are purely 
psychological. Airplane travel is 
supposed to be an exciting experi­
ence. The root of this excitement 
should not be crash-paranoia 
stemmingfrom the fear of sudden 
cabin depressurization resulting 
from a meal cart breaking loose 
from its pre-Columbian binding 
and ramming you before it bar­
rels its way through the thin cabin 
wall protecting everybody from 
the exterior.
Needless to say, bearing wit­
ness to the spectacle of three stew­
ardesses and a flight officer at­
tempting to secure the aforemen­
tioned cart did something to 
undermine my confidence in the 
airline. I hope that this was not 
what they meant by “in-flight 
entertainment.” I suppose that 
the true difficulty in my flight to 
England lay in my having been 
seated beside the galley.
Conventional wisdom has led 
us to believe that because an air­
plane is such a high-tech piece of 
equipment, the staff should con­
sist of a crack squadron of equally 
high-tech, amazonian stepford­
like, master race trained androids.
Since the galley bulkhead only 
afforded me a one-third’s view of 
the in-flight movie (it’s all right, I 
don’t consider “Coming to Amer­
ica” to be a full movie anyway), I 
contented myself with observing 
the plane’s staff in their only place 
of privacy.
Needless to say, watching them 
in all of their complaining, eating 
(by the way, I’m convinced that 
what air travelers are truly served 
is a petrochemical compound 
molecularly designed to go from 
steaming to arctic between the 
first two forkfulls) and spitting 
(yes, spitting), humanity made 
me much more aware of the thin 
wire by which we hung.
One final and unrelated
thought: anyone who is still 
naive enough to believe that we 
live in a classless democracy 
should be asked to compare and 
contrast the coach and “upper- • 
class”; of any airline. Indeed, ; 
the sight of the La-z-boy like ac­
commodations, a la carte menu, 
full complimentary bar and in-„, 
dividually wrapped enuch-^ 
masseuse against the ten per­
son per square inch coach gulag 
should be enough to convince 
anyone of the vast hardships, 
which vast amounts of money., 
simply does not bring.
Coming Soon: A live report of 
the gala opening of “Andrew 
Lloyd Weber’s laundry list and 
doodle pad!”

Crawling across heavily wooded 
enemy territory, garbed in camou- 
flauge clothing, you carry a pistol 
at your side. A crackle of the 
underbrush, you turn — too late. 
Somebody else's gun goes off and 
you find a sticky liquid oozing on 
your chest. Y ou've just been killed 
and it's not even noon.
The situation is not as bad as it 
seems. The person who shot you 
is probably your friend. And your 
chest is only smeared with or­
ange or yellow paint. You’re play­
ing a Survival Game, a rapidly- 
growing form of group entertain­
ment.
Survival Games are outdoor 
games of capture-the-flag, also 
known as “paint-ball games” be­
cause the CO-2 pistols used fire 
small soft-gelatin paint capsules 
which break on impact, splatter­
ing you with paint and eliminat­
ing you from the game. Thepopu­
larity of Survival Games has 
grown since their conception in
1981, and now Carnegie Mellon 
organizations are getting into the 
act, notably Phi Kappa Theta 
fraternity, which plans a Survival 
Game as a Rush event. Origi­
nally planned for last Saturday, 
the event was cancelled because 
of heavy rains from Hurricane 
Hugo, but will be rescheduled.
According to Mike Stratton of 
Phi Kap, the fraternity noticed an 
advertisement in The Tartan for 
Three Rivers Survival Games and 
decided the game would make a 
suitable Rush activity. Deborah 
Krishke of Three Rivers Survival
Games wholeheartedly agrees. 
She sees them as a suitable alter­
native to the traditional frater­
nity and bachelor parties, “ideal 
for a Rush party, or to build 
camaraderie within a group.” 
Some people have expressed 
concern about the “paramilitary 
trappings” of Survival Games. 
Krischke disagrees, considering 
them more akin to the traditional 
hide-and-seek or Cowboys-and- 
Indians than to military activi­
ties. “There’s something about 
the word ‘gotcha’ .... you get a 
thrill out of it and ... that’s what 
this game is — kind of like tag.” 
Players occasionally combine the 
game with a cookout at the Games’ 
field location in Cranberry. 
“There’s a reason we use orange- 
and-yellow paint, not red paint,” 
explains Krischke, who is con-
cemed about the image of the 
Games.
Another issue raised is that of 
safety. Again, such fears are 
apparently unfounded. Three 
Rivers Survival Games goes over 
the rules extensively at the pre­
game orientation. All players 
wear safety goggles, and face 
masks are optional but recom­
mended. The games are fully 
insured, Krischke says, and 
“safer than fishing.”
Three Rivers Survival Games 
holds morning and afternoon 
sessions every weekend. The 
games are played year-round, 
but with its cool weather and 
colorful foliage, autumn could be 
considered the best time of the 
year—as long as the Pittsburgh 
area is not struck by passing 
hurricanes.

Timothy Leary, whose reputation as a proponent of LSD precedes him, addressed a 
crowded Skibo Ballroom on Thursday.
By TERENCE SPIES
Tartan Staffwriter
Timothy Leary, advocate of personal 
freedom and alternate realities, not to 
mention LSD, spoke in the packed Skibo 
Ballroom last Thursday. His rambling 
“Walk Through the Twentieth Century” 
illustrated his personal vision of history 
leading to the liberation of the individ­
ual.
Leary has spent the past seven years 
involved in the computer industry, work­
ing with what he has termed “virtual re­
ality.”
The aim of virtual reality is to allow a 
person to “exist” within a computer pro­
gram. At a demonstration earlier in the 
afternoon, Leary showed a videotape of a 
glove and goggle system that allowed a 
user to “walk around” computer-created 
space, picking up objects and looking at 
things.
The computer system Leary displayed 
was developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. Leary’s involvment per­
tained to using existing technology to 
open up new educational avenues with 
computers.
At the demonstration, Leary also talked 
about Head Coach, a linguistics tool used 
to “add Einsteinian dimensionality” to a 
concept like “Ronald Reagan” or “thrifty.” 
According to Leary, this increased di­
mensionality allows people to communi­
cate more freely by more exactly specify­
ing the concepts about which they are 
speaking.
There is a unifying idea Leary has 
behind all of this technology. It is the 
idea of the computer as an “interper­
sonal communication device,” or, as he 
put it, a “cyberphone.”
Leary theorizes that a world inside the 
computer (“Cyberia”) will eventually 
decentralize control over information and 
allow people to use their brains more ef­
fectively. In this manner, he theorizes, 
computers have taken over the role that 
he once assigned LSD in his schema of 
the world.

‘But, Mr. Martin, 
it’s an amphibian!’
By EMC J. MCANALLEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Editor’s note: The names of 
people and places in this article 
have been changed to maintain 
confidentiality, although The 
Tartan does not encourage the 
practice of resident students keep­
ing pets without the permission of 
the Universtiy as mentioned in the 
article.
My freshman year RA once said 
to me, “The only pets allowed on 
this campus are amphibians.”
“Amphibians?” I replied in my
naivete.
“You know, animals that can 
stay under water for more than a 
minute.”
Still not certain I understood, I 
looked up the policy in the fresh­
man handbook. University regu­
lations state, “Dogs, cats, and 
other pets are not permitted in 
any University buildings ... un­
der any circumstances.”
Given the above information 
and a wild imagination, I sur­
mised that the governing body 
must have made an exception in 
the case of amphibians. There­
fore, there should be only one type 
of pet on campus, (Forgive me, I 
assumed everyone was honest and 
followed the rules decreed by our 
omnipotent University leaders.) 
the amphibian.
Well, it wasn’t long afterwards 
that I discovered that there were 
actually two kinds of pets on
campus as well as two types of pet 
owners: legal (the amphibians) 
and illegal. Let me define these 
for you more clearly.
The legal grouping ranges from 
the normal garden variety tropi­
cal fish to the occasional frog and 
salamander.
I even know of a student who 
has crabs. Get your mind out of 
that gutter; I meant hermit crabs. 
(Yes, I know hermit crabs aren’t 
amphibious, but they’re close 
enough.)
Incidentally, according to these 
standards, it would seem that it is 
perfectly legal, though probably 
uncommon, for a student to keep 
a four-foot aligator in his room. 
Or a school of pirhana. Might 
make the tub a little crowded on

Grab the snorkel, Boston! This year old cat Is about to be put to the Infamous one-minute underwater rule 
perpetuated by many RAs. In reality, this Is only an Interpretation of the actual University rule.
The results are 
in! Sixty percent 
of the surveys re­
turned indicated 
that people would 
be willing to pur­
chase small, func­
tional pieces ofthe 
Fence. Prices they 
would pay ranged 
from $1 to $5 for a 
piece measuring a 
few cubic inches.
A small percent­
age of students, 
however, objected 
to the selling of the 
Fence as degrad­
ing to the tradi­
tion.
What should we do with the Fence?

There are also, however, the 
“illegal” pets, consisting of dogs, 
cats, gerbils, hamsters, rabbits, 
gophers, chipmunks, ferrets, 
groundhogs, aardvarks, little 
brothers, kangaroos, wombats, 
koala bears, and of course, field 
mice. These are just as common 
as the legal sort, although much 
harder to find.
However, no matter which type 
of pet you may aspire to own, they 
all have one thing in common: the 
right to a healthy, well maintained 
environment: the proper foodstuff, 
appropriate amounts of affection, 
sufficient space, andgoodhygiene.
As Lome Greene would say, 
“The trick to a happy, healthy dog 
is in his food.” Every animal needs 
the correct nutritional diet, but 
before you go out and buy a ten- 
pound bag of puppy chow, do your 
homework. Find out what type of 
food is healthy for your pet. Every 
type of furball eats something
different; dogs need dog food, 
puppies need puppy food, kittens 
need kitten food, and koalas need 
eucalyptus leaves. It helps if you 
have a eucalyptus tree outside 
your window.
However, keep in mind that 
quantity is just as important as 
quality. Don’t overfeed your pet 
under the pretense of kindness. 
Obesity is just as dangerous for 
our fuzzy companions as it is for 
humans. Fluffy will eat whatever 
amount you put out for him, even 
if it makes him sick. Don’t kid 
yourself, this is not kindness.
Sufficient space in a dorm room 
is a real problem. Some of the 
closets we live in aren’t big enough 
to sneeze in safely let alone keep 
a pet. A good friend of mine called 
it downright cruel to keep a little 
furry guy all cramped up in a 
dorm room. She’s right. A pet 
needs space. So before you go out 
and buy a Shetland pony, decide, 
is your room fish-sized, kitten­
sized, or pony-sized? (If your room 
is pony-sized, I want to move in 
with you.)
Pets are almost people too, and 
they need just as much affection 
as the average person. So love, 
hug and cherish the cuddly little 
guy as much as humanly pos­
sible. This is also good for the 
human occupants of the room.
Cleanliness is next to godliness, 
and for a pet confined in a donn 
room, it could mean all the differ­
ence in the world. First, you need 
to designate a place where fluffy 
can relieve himself; a litterbox, 
newspapers spread on the floor, a 
stable.
Next, you need to keep the little 
guy clean. Cats are self cleaning 
like the ovens we all have at home, 
but dogs are another story. Aft;er 
a while they start to smell like, 
well you know, a dog. For sm&ll 
creatures who live in cages and 
tanks, you need to clean them out

periodically. None of your friends 
are going to come to visit if your 
ipom smells like a dung heap.
; Also, it is important to have 
$our pet clipped, cut, fixed, spayed 
and neutered. A fixed pet is much 
Happier and healthier. Face it, a 
dog in heat is not a happy sight in 
an enclosed dorm room.
¦ I managed to talk to various 
pets and their owners. Robert 
Redford, a cat owner, had only 
ojie thing to say to me, “You use 
ifry name and I’ll break your legs!” 
His cat, Spuds, had just come 
back from the Veterinarian’s. He 
Had been, as his owner put it, 
tutored. Paul Newman, Redford’s 
roommate quipped, “It’s a good 
thing I never went to any of those 
tutoring sessions when I was a 
freshman!”
‘None of this, however, ad­
dresses the harsh reality that the 
cute little guys are not allowed on 
campus. How do you get around
this? Well, you could dress fluffy 
up in green scales and put him in 
an aquarium every time the RA 
comes around, or you could prove 
for once and for all that he is, in 
fact, an amphibian.
Which brings me to the two 
guys at the end of my hall. Upon 
hearing the RA’s definition of an 
amphibian, they held their pet 
hamster under water for a min­
ute. Luckily, the poor thing was, 
indeed, amphibious.

The story behind the mathematics that have baffled man since the beginning of time
By JASON SMITH
Tartan Staffwriter
Editor’s note: This is the
installment of a new regular Tar­
tan column. Jason Smith is a 
freshman in CIT studying me­
chanical engineering.
In the beginning, there was an 
empty set.
The Lord God looked down upon 
the empty set, and He was dis­
pleased.
And so He said, “Let there be 
numbers!” and there were num­
bers.
4. And He smiled at His work 
and it was good.
5. All this was done between 
the rising and falling of the first 
day.
6. The Lord God did look out
over the numbers and He did be­
come confused.
For He could not discern where 
the numbers did end and where 
the numbers did begin.
7. And so He did say, “Let there 
be an order to the numbers!”
8. And there was an order to the 
numbers.
9. And this order was good.
10. All this was done between 
the rising and falling of the second 
day.
11. When the numbers were in 
order, He did say, “Let half the 
numbers be used for counting the 
sheep and the oxen of the field, and 
let them be called the positive 
numbers.”
12. “And let half of the numbers
be called negative, and let them 
be used only in abstract math. 
For, yea, verily, these numbers 
are evil and should be used as 
seldomly as possible, for it is 
My Word.”
13. And it was so.
14. All this was done between 
the rising and the falling of the 
third day.
15. The Lord God did then 
say, “Let there be a firmament 
which shall divide the positive 
numbers from the negative 
numbers.
16. “And let the firmament 
be known as Zero!
17. “And let those foolish 
enough to divide by Zero suffer 
my righteous vengence!”
18. And it was so.
19. All this was done between the 
rising and falling of the fourth day.
20. On the fifth day, God created 
man, woman, good, evil, life, death, 
video cassette recorders, dry ce­
real, taxi cabs, and a whole lot of 
other stuff.
21. And these were good.
22. But not as good as numbers, 
because He had been working so 
hard earlier that He was all tired 
out now, and not doing His best 
work.
23. All this was done between the 
rising and falling of the fifth day.
24. God then called the first man, 
whom He had named Adam, and 
did give unto the man Adam all of 
the laws governing the proper use
of numbers, both positive and ' 
negative, in His kingdom.
25. God did say unto Adam, “Go 
forth and multiply, and divide, 
and study all of the laws of My 
kingdom.
“For there shall come a time \ 
when you shall be held respon­
sible for these, My laws.”
26. And Adam did take these 
laws from the Lord and he did 
learn the laws, and the laws were 
good.
27. At least that was one opin­
ion.
28. All this was done between 
the rising and the falling of the 
sixth day.
29. And on the seventh day, He 
tested.
Please complete this form even if you submitted information over the summer or at the Activities Fair.

Bravo!
Music department celebrates 75 years
By SCARLETT TOWNSEND
Tartan Staffwriter
This year is one of celebration 
for CMU’s Music and Drama 
Departments; each celebrates its 
75th anniversary. The Music 
Department’s festivities begin 
this evening with a tribute to its 
musical partner, the Pittsburgh 
Symphony.
The Carnegie Mellon Philhar­
monic begins its season with the 
gala salute to the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra tonight at 8 
pm in the Carnegie Music Hall. 
The concert is definitely a “must 
see” event, and there is no charge 
to members of the CMU commu­
nity.
Currently, there are 19 mem­
bers of the Pittsburgh Symphony 
who teach in the Carnegie Mellon 
Music Department. Since CMU is 
proud of this relationship between 
the Department and the sym­
phony, it will be celebrated in 
tonight’s concert. Sidney Harth, 
interim director of orchestral 
studies at CMU, will conduct the 
Philharmonic in a program that 
will open with Wagner’s The 
Mastersingers of Nuernberg.
Andres Cardenes, associate 
professor of violin studies and 
concertmaster of the Pittsburgh 
Symphony, will join the Philhar­
monic as soloist for Vieuxtemp’s 
Violin Concerto No. 5 in A Minor. 
For the final number, Rach­
maninov’s Symphony No. 2 in E 
Minor, many of the faculty mem­
bers who are also symphony 
musicians will join their students 
on stage. The contributing fac­
ulty will consist primarily of the 
string instrument teachers, be­
cause extra players in the string 
section will not upset the balance 
of the piece.
Usually the Music Department 
only recruits fall-time symphony
members for teaching positions. 
However, CMU offered Cardenes, 
previously a teacher at the Uni­
versity of Michigan and part-time 
member of the Pittsburgh Sym­
phony, a position in the depart­
ment. He then moved to Pitts­
burgh and joined the faculty and 
the symphony full-time.
Bruce Carr, the manager of 
publications and outreach for the 
Pittsburgh Symphony, will host a 
pre-concert conversation with 
Cardenes about his career, the 
Vieuxtemps violin concerto, and 
the evening’s program.
Why would full-time profes­
sional performers also want to be 
full-time teachers? Music Depart­
ment Head Marilyn Taft Thomas 
said, “Most professional musi­
cians are the best in the country, 
and they know [that] the reason 
... they have reached that level is 
because of their teachers. Music 
is a master-apprentice relation­
ship. The masters want to give 
something back by making other 
musicians into masters. This is a 
very rewarding relationship.”
The Music Department’s mas­
ter teachers must be creating 
master musicians, for the depart­
ment and several students have 
received many honors and 
awards. CMU winners of the 
Sylvie Derdeyn Voice Scholar­
ships, a national award for stu­
dent singers, will be announced 
at the concert. The National 
Federation of Music Clubs 
awarded the Music Department 
First Prize for the Performance 
and Promotion of American Music 
in their 1989 Award Program for 
Educational Institutions.
The Carnegie Mellon Philhar­
monic concert is at 8pm tonight at 
the Carnegie Music Hall on Forbes 
Avenue, Oakland. Admission is 
free with a CMU student ID.

After the biggest box-office 
summer in Hollywood history, the 
movie industry turns to its great­
est warriors this fall to win your 
^wallet. You can look forward to 
seeing Robert DeNiro, Jack
Nicholson, Paul Newman, and 
many other top actors and ac­
tresses.
h Newman’s new film Fat Man 
wand Little Boy opens on October 
20. The film, set during World 
War II, deals with the creation of 
the atomic bomb. Newman plays 
Major General Leslie Groves, the 
man who recruited Dr. J. Robert 
kOppenheimer for the legendary 
¦Manhattan Project that developed 
the first atomic bombs.
Fans of the classic A-Team tele­
vision show will be pleased to see 
Dwight Schultz, a.k.a. Howlin’ 
^Mad Murdock, making his mo­
tion picture debut as Oppen-
heimer. “This is a film about 
human beings and all their 
frailties. Fat Man and Little Boy 
illuminates the feelings and ex­
periences of people involved in a 
momentous course of events,” says 
Schultz.
The production crew ofFat Man 
and Little Boy is one of the best of 
all the movies to come out this 
fall. Roland Jaffe, whose past 
accomplishments include The 
Killing Fields and The Mission, 
directs a talented crew of Acad­
emy Award winners.
Newman will also star this 
Christmas in Blaze, a real-life 
drama based upon Louisiana 
governor Earl K Long’s contro­
versial relationship with a woman 
named Blaze Starr.
Another 1940s-era movie com­
ing out this fall is Nicholson’s The 
Two Jakes. Nicholson reprises his 
role as private detective Jake 
Gittes from the classic Chinatown. 
The mystery is set in Los Angeles
and deals with a murder investi­
gation that ties in with Gittes’ 
mysterious past.
One of the notable aspects of 
the film will be its look. “Hard 
surfaces, sharp negatives,” 
Nicholson says. The Two Jakes 
marks the third time that 
Nicholson will star and direct in a 
motion picture.
The Two Jakes is written, by 
Robert Towne, who won an Oscar 
for the original screenplay of 
Chinatown. It co-stars Harvey 
Keitel and Meg Tilly. The film 
opens December 15.
Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, 
and Redd Foxx star in what prom­
ises to be the most popular movie 
of the fall, Harlem Nights. Pryor 
and Murphy play a father-and- 
son team who own the most popu­
lar night club in Harlem. The 
movie deals with their satirical 
struggle with a big time mobster 
named Bugsy Calhoun. “I grew

¦ You might remember my little 
•cousin Wilbur, who lives in a 
cardboard box down on Jackson 
Street and only has one nostril. 
He was bom that way, but we 
didn’t notice it till he was four 
years old. Otis Leakey was visit­
ing one day from Paducah, Ken­
tucky, and he said, “Have y’all 
looked at Little Wilbur lately?” 
And we said, “What?” And he said 
“Have y’all looked at Little Wilbur 
lately? You know, you ought to 
get that boy checked.” Otis 
couldn’t put his finger on it, but 
he knew something was wrong 
with Wilbur’s face. And so we 
took Wilbur to the doctor, and 
sure enough, he was missing one 
nostril. We probly never would of 
known aboutitif Otishadn’tcome 
to visit that year.
Anyhow, that’s beside the point. 
The point is that we’ve been trying 
to get Little Wilbur to get a good 
paying job for several years now, 
but Wilbur is what you call your 
chronically unemployed. It’s 
partly due to discrimination 
against the partial-nosed popula­
tion, but I think it’s mainly cause 
of Wilbur’s own attitude.
“I don’t have to work,” he’ll tell 
you. “I have a handicapped 
sticker.” It’s true. Wilbur wrote 
off to the Texas Department of 
Motor Vehicles and got himself a 
handicapped sticker. He wears it 
on his forehead.
“Wilbur, just cause you’re 
handicapped doesn’t mean you 
have to sit around on Jackson 
Street all day being pitiful. You
r
0ill The Drive-In
could at least volunteer for the 
Special Olympics or something.”
“I earned this nostril,” Wilbur 
told me, “and I’m gonna use it.”
Besides, two years ago we tried 
to put Little Wilbur in the Special 
Olympics, but they said he was 
the only single-nostriléd person 
they’d ever had and they didn’t 
have anybody to compete against 
him.
“That just shows you,” he said,
“the prejudice of the full-nose 
population at large.”
I told Wilbur it would be differ­
ent if his nostril got shot off in 
Vietnam or something, but he was 
a natural-born one-nostril man 
and so ...
“There are plenty of cocaine- 
head Hollywood producers with 
nostrils worse than mine!” he 
interrupted. “They could have put 
them in the Special Olympics.”
“Wilbur, cocaine-head Holly­
wood producers can’t use a table 
fork, much less a discus.”
Wilbur snorted.
“Please don’t do that again,” I 
told him. “That’s the one thing 
you can do that grosses me out.”
“You see?” Wilbur said. “It’s 
because I have one nostril, isn’t 
it? If anybody else had a cold, as I 
happen to have at this very
moment, you 
wouldn’t say any­
thing, would you? 
But when it’s a 
handicapped per­
son ...”
“I don’t care how••••••many nostnls you 
have. I don’t care whether you’re 
handicapped or not — and by the 
way, take that sticker off your 
forehead, it’s annoying—the least 
you could do is work the check­
out line at Kroger’s.”
“Do you know what people 
would do in a grocery store check­
out line the first time they saw a 
one-nostriled person?”
“Check out?”
“They would laugh! They would 
whisper! They would turn away! 
They would make their children 
go to another line! They would...”
I guess it was about then that I 
smacked Wilbur right in the ... 
well, I guess you know where I 
smacked him.
Hell be out of the hospital this 
week.
Maybe the carnival has some­
thing.
And speaking of mutated hu­
man flesh attempting to be taken 
seriously, the best drive-in movie 
of1989just came out this week— 
Mutant on the Bounty, the en­
grossing (and grossing) story of a 
horribly mutilated saxophone 
player who’s rescued from a 
freefall through outer space by a 
ship full of bored singles-bar re­
jects. Meet the Hawaii an-shirted 
Skipper, his stuttering first mate,
Ah, outer space: home of maidens, mutants, and the occasional sax player in Mutants on the Bounty.

It’s amazing how many “punks” 
came out of the woodwork for the 
Bad Brains show last Monday 
night. I didn’t know so many 
people owned combat boots. I 
guess they only bring them out 
for special occasions, like a chance 
to run into people without worry­
ing about reprisals.
I used to enjoy being in the 
“pit,” but the general intelligence 
level of the crowd at the Bad 
Brains show was at subterranean 
levels. Everyone was less intent 
on dancing than they were on 
smashing the people in front into 
the stage, except for a few morons 
who kept flailing through the 
surrounding crowd. (Flailing is 
okay, except when the people 
being flailed through are just 
standing there and don’t appreci-

ate getting elbowed in the face. 
Come to think of it, nobody appre­
ciates getting elbowed in the face, 
so maybe flailing isn’t such a hot 
idea.)
The Bad Brains themselves 
were adequate, if not inspired. I 
don’t think they saved rock and 
roll that night, but they were good 
anyway. They played a lot of reg­
gae, including some tunes that 
have never made it to vinyl (with 
equally obscure titles), possibly 
as an attempt to keep the crowd 
from killing each other. In gen­
eral, the Bad 
Brains were good 
when they played 
fast, and less good 
when they didn’t. 
They weren’t four­
teen dollars good 
— maybe seven or 
eight, possibly ten 
including Leeway, 
who I missed semi-unintention- 
ally.
The strangest thing of the show 
was watching the “white power” 
skinheads dance to an all-black 
band. I was hoping that they 
would strangle in a philosophical 
dilemma, but no such luck. (How 
do you know who’s into the white 
power thing? Look for the skin­
heads in rugby shirts that only 
talk to other skinheads, and you’ll 
probably be right.)

and tries to make him forget his 
troubles — namely, that his face 
now looks like a can of Raviolios, 
and a couple of intergalactic 
Seven-Eleven robbers named Rick 
and Manny are coming to point 
ray guns at him and giggle a lot. 
What’s the point? The same point 
as every outer-space movie for the 
last thirty years — will the uni­
verse be destroyed by the virus 
that only they know about?
There have been several at­
tempts at outer-space comedy 
before, but this one is the cham­

picks dead skin off his face in 
every scene.

In jazz, the battle is between old and new
By JEFF MULLER
Tartan Staffwriter
So, you’ve come back for more! 
Well, I’ve got something special 
in store for you this week; a little 
discussion about the importance 
of the jazz traditionalist.
There exists a controversy 
among jazz players and critics as 
to whether or not some musicians 
should spend their careers play­
ing older forms of jazz. Some see 
this pursuit as being uncreative 
and against the general ideals of 
jazz. Obviously, they believe that 
the direction that all jazz players 
should take is to expand the 
boundaries of the idiom — to 
progress.
This point of view is unfortu­
nate, for without some people to 
I preserve the older styles of jazz, 
future generations and multi­
tudes of people today would go 
without ever having the chance to 
| experience many beautiful styles 
of music.
Imagine if the music directors 
\ of all the symphonies of the world 
| decided that they would only 
program twentieth century com­
posers for their organizations to 
! perform. This would rob many 
! concertgoers of the chance to hear 
| Beethoven or Mozart or Schubert 
I performed in a live setting. Of 
| course the recordings would con- 
! tinue to exist, but Memorex never 
does have the same impact as live 
performance.
/ Now apply this same situation
to the world of jazz. Imagine that 
people no longer performed big 
band swing as a style of music. 
Even if a band were to play Duke 
Ellington’s “Creole Love Call” in 
a fusion style, it would not be the 
same. The notes would remain 
unchanged, but the elegance with 
which Ellington wrote and ar­
ranged it would be lost. Once 
again, people would be able to 
purchase an Ellington album, but 
they would never get to experi­
ence the excitement of the music 
when performed live.
Of course, the members of the 
jazz community who do expand 
the realm of the idiom and take 
the music in new directions play a 
very important role. Jazz is a 
dynamic form of music and by 
nature requires constant change 
within itself. But the need to 
preserve the older forms must also 
be realized in more than record­
ings.
Many of the older players today 
strive to keep alive the styles that 
they helped to create. The Preser­
vation Hall Jazz Band has be­
come prominent as the modem 
purveyors of Dixieland. The band
members are all 
veteran players 
who have spent 
years entertain­
ing audiences 
with the sounds 
of New Orleans 
jazz.
Art Blakey, 
the 70-year-old 
legendary j azz drummer, has kept 
hard-bop going strong for more 
than 30 years. He is constantly 
recruiting young musicians to 
play with him, thereby keeping 
the style alive with each new 
generation.
Younger players like Donald 
Harrison and Terrence Blan­
chard, both veterans of Art 
Blakey’s Jazz Messengers, have 
continued in the tradition of ear­
lier styles while at the same time 
expanding the idiom. In their case, 
they have emulated Miles Davis 
(vintage sixties Miles, that is) 
while adding elements of them­
selves to the music. In other words, 
they have personalized the mo- 
dal/cool/bop style of Miles and 
made it into something of their 
own.
Trombone player Curtis Fuller 
and pianist Cedar Walton, both 
veterans of Blakey’s early sixties 
J azz Messengers, are coming soon 
to Pittsburgh along with the other 
members of The Timeless All- 
Stars. Billy Higgins, who came to 
critical attention as the drummer 
in Ornette Coleman’s band in the 
late fifties, will join Fuller and
Walton, along with Bobby Hutch­
erson on vibraphone, Buster Wil­
liams on bass, and Harold Land 
on tenor sax. (Land is probably 
best known for his association 
with the late trumpet virtuoso, 
Clifford Brown.) This group, 
composed of some of the best hard- 
bop soloists in the world today, 
has been together since 1983 and
has developed an exceptional 
musical rapport as a unit.
The show will be held on Octo­
ber 11 at the Manchester 
Craftsmen’s Guild, with 
showtimes at 7 and 9:30 pm. 
Advance tickets are currently on 
sale at all Kaufmann’s, National 
Record Marts, Oasis Records and 
TTX. (You can also charge by phone
by calling 363-0500.) Believe me, 
this is not a show to miss.
That’s it for another week. I’ll 
leave you with a few words from 
trumpeter and bebop great, Dizzy 
Gillespie: “The concerts they’re 
having, where they go back 
through the music because so 
many people didn’t hear it when 
it was first performed, are groovy.”

“real” punk, or just want to give 
your money to someone more 
deserving than CBS, pick up The 
State of the Union, Dischord Rec­
ords’ latest compilation. It’s a 
benefit record, with the profits 
going to the American Civil Lib­
erties Union (you know, the ACLU 
-that nasty bunch of liberals that 
keeps messing up book bannings 
and religious discrimination and 
all the other tilings that make our 
country what it is today) and the 
Community For Creative Nonvi­
olence (a Washington, D.C. or­
ganization that helps the home­
less, among other things).
The record is actually a joint 
project between Dischord and 
Positive Force DC, and includes 
songs by fifteen D.C. bands like 
Scream, Soul Side, Fugazi, and 
Fire Party, as well as some lesser- 
known bands like Broken Siren, 
Christ On A Crutch, and Red 
Emma. All of the songs are unre-
“You could make a record, write a 
song; organize a demonstration, etc. 
So, why don’t you?”
— Album liner notes
leased (well, almost — Ignition 
contributes a live version of 
“Anger Means” from their appear­
ance on the John Peel Show), and 
some, like the tracks from Three 
and Fidelity Jones (with Tomas 
Squip and Dug E. Bird, formerly 
in Beefeater, and a bunch of new 
people from bands I don’t know 
about) are the only tracks the 
bands have out. (But not for long, 
since both will soon have wax out 
from Dischord.) At least half of 
the tunes are very good, with only 
one dog in the bunch (an Alarm- 
ish anthem from Marginal Man).
Undoubtedly, some people will 
find the whole package unbeara­
bly preachy and self-righteous. It 
is focused, but that’s its intent — 
the record, and the booklet that 
comes with it, offers an alterna­
tive to the commercialization and 
apathy so prevalent in “punk” rock 
today. As a line in the booklet 
puts it, “This album was made by 
people very much like you — you 
could make a record, write a song, 
organize a demonstration, etc. So, 
why don’t you?” (The record is 
available for $6 postpaid from 
Dischord Records, 3819 Beecher 
Street N.W., Washington, D.C,;, 
20007, if nowhere else.)

up on tales of Harlem in the ‘old 
days’ and I’ve always been fasci­
nated with that special time and 
place,” says Murphy. “I’ve 
dreamed of making a film about 
Harlem, but an even bigger dream 
was to work with Richard Pryor. 
I’ve been planning this since I 
was 15.” Harlem Nights is pro­
duced, directed, and written by 
Murphy. It will be in theaters on 
November 17.
Another fall comedy, We’re No 
Angels, stars DeNiro and Sean 
Penn, who play two petty crimi­
nals that get caught up in a mys­
tical New England town while on 
the run to the Canadian border.
: We’re No Angels is written by 
Pulitzer Prize writer David 
Mamet, who also wrote the screen­
play for The Untouchables. The 
film is directed by Neil Jordan, 
whose previous work includes 
MonaLisa. We’reNoAngels opens 
December 8.
“Beauty is a thing of the mind. 
So is revenge,” say the promo­
tional posters for Johnny Hand­
some. Mickey Rourke returns to 
the big screen in this murder 
mystery.
The film is going for the noir 
look that has become so popular 
of late, and is set in New Orleans 
(as was Rourke’s popular feature 
Angel Heart). Rourke plays a de­
generate low life nicknamed 
Johnny Handsome because of his 
disfigurement.
Johnny leams the hard way that 
thero is r\o hono.: among thieves, 
when his partners frame him, kill 
his best friend and make off with 
the money from a heist gone bad. 
Johnny swears that the devious 
deeds will not go unpunished. 
While in jail, Johnny is given a 
second chance at life on the out­
side as an altruistic plastic sur­
geon performs corrective surgery 
that makes him ... handsome. 
Johnny gets a job in the shipyards 
and falls for angelic Elizabeth 
McGovern, but the hunger for 
revenge gnaws at Johnny’s soul.
Johnny Handsome also stars 
talented actor Morgan Freeman 
of Lean On Me fame as a hard 
nosed New Orleans cop who 
thinks Johnny hasn’t been reha­
bilitated. Ellen Barkin and Lance 
Henriksen star as Johnny’s bru­
tal criminal cohorts, and Forest 
Whitaker plays the good doctor.
On the brighter side is an off­
beat movie about the first year of 
medical school called Gross Anat- 
oniy. It heralds a talented cast 
including Michael Modine and
Christine Lahti. The Disney 
company will soon release its first 
animated feature based on a fairy 
tale since 1958, called The Little 
Mermaid.
Here are some movies in the 
distant future: Tom Selleck and 
F. Murray Abraham star in Inno­
cent Man, a movie about a man 
who is framed for a murder he 
didn’t commit; Pauline Collins 
recreates her Tony Award win­
ning stage role in Shirley Valen­
tine; Michael J. Fox returns in 
Back To the Future II; Frank 
Miller, author of The Dark Knight 
Returns, is writing the screen­
play for RoboCop II; the film ver­
sion of Tom Clancy’s Hunt for Red 
October will star Sean Connery 
as Russian submarine captain 
Marko Ramius; and finally, Bat­
man II is planned to start produc­
tion in May of 1990.
So don’t worry if the current 
crop of movies leaves you cold — 
Hollywood has a few tricks up its 
sleeve for the new season.
How’re you going to do it?

Midway through Black Rain, 
Nick Conklin offers shrewd ad­
vice. “Sometimes,” says the saga­
cious New York cop, “you gotta 
forget your head and grab your 
balls.” Although this exhortation 
is directed at Conklin’s reluctant 
Japanese partner, the audience 
ought to take heed as well. Black 
Rain doesn’t pay much regard to 
its head (nor the viewer’s, for that 
matter), and frequently has its 
fist clenched firmly on its crotch.
Black Rain can’t seem to wait 
for the opening credits to end so it 
can start the aforementioned 
grabbing. The film follows the cop 
drama archetype to the letter, 
barreling down a familiar path 
that even a moderately jaded 
audience knows all too well. The 
movie takes New York City detec­
tives Nick Conklin and Charlie 
Vincent over to Japan, where they
must track down a violent Japa­
nese mobster. They receive help 
from Osaka detective Masahiro 
Matsumoto and from a voluptu­
ous expatriate club hostess, 
played with great cleavage by 
Kate Capshaw.
Heading this autoerotic cast is 
the ubiquitous Michael Douglas, 
fresh from his 1987 best actor 
Oscarforhisrole as Gordon Gekko 
in Wall Street. As Nick Conklin, 
Douglas feels liberated to dredge 
up all the loner, renegade, hard- 
as-nails cop cliches he has at his 
disposal: specifically, his irksome 
two-day facial growth, his roar­
ing motorcycle, his dark shades, 
and his clenched-teeth delivery. 
Douglas’s performance is over­
wrought, typified by embarrass­
ing histrionics in crucial scenes 
and a tendency to lean towards 
melodramatics.
The supporting cast is much 
more pleasant to watch. As Char­
lie, Andy Garcia is charming and
brings a terrific buoyancy to his 
character and to this otherwise 
darkfilm. KenTakakuraportrays 
Matsumoto with sensitivity, 
making clear the clash of cultures 
and attitudes toward detective 
work. The Osaka detective often 
speaks of “duty and honor,” and 
reprimands his American 
counterpart for dishonoring him­
self and his colleagues with his 
end-justifies-the-means attitude. 
Garcia and Takakura share a very 
amusing scene in which they 
perform an inebriated rendition 
of Ray Charles’s “That’s What I 
Say” at a posh Japanese night­
club. Even this is not a novel turn, 
but the players’ disarming en­
ergy is a credit to their abilities.
The film’s major stumbling 
block is the screenwriting. A pre­
dictable plot alone is not enough 
to offend the average moviegoer, 
but that flaw paired with some of 
the absolutely worst movie dia­
logue heard in modem times is a

fatal combination. Hyperbole, you 
say? Here, then, are a few choice 
examples:
“It ain’t easy out there.” 
“Sometimes you gotta go for it.” 
“There’s a war going on here 
and they don’t take prisoners.” 
“You watch your tail, cowboy.” 
Lines like these can be distract­
ing, as it is hard to hold down 
giggles when at a critical moment 
Douglas says, “What am I, 
chopped liver?” While Garcia and 
Takakura honorably try to over­
come the lame script, Douglas 
seems to wallow in it, much to the 
detriment of the movie.
The one aspect of Black Rain 
that forsakesgenital-fon dling for 
more innovative and effective 
methods is Ridley Scott’s direc­
tion. Borrowing from his techni­
cally awesome film Blade Run­
ner, Scott represents metropoli­
tan Japan with his trademark 
atmospheric touches. Steam and 
neon, ceiling fans, and Venetian
blinds abound.
Scott’s talents 
extend even into 
the hackneyed 
arena of chase 
scenes, which 
are executed 
with precision 
and undeniable 
intensity. To say 
Black Rain is a 
triumph of style 
over substance 
is worthless, 
considering the 
sad absence of
the latter. For Scott, style is sub­
stance.
The climactic scene of Black 
Rain is, to extend the masturba­
tion metaphor, less than orgas­
mic. Things explode, people get 
riddled with bullets, Douglas 
comes to fisticuffs with his arch­
foe, Sato (YusakuMatsudo)—it’s 
no biggie. As an action/drama, 
Black Rain is painfully deficient
in the drama department, but 
when Scott takes control, the 
action is enthralling. So while 
seeing it, the audience should bear 
in mind Conklin’s Confucian 
advice. Ignore the brain and in­
dulge the groin.
Black Rain is showing at the 
King’s Court theater in Oakland.

Fed up with deciding what to do 
in Pittsburgh? Fear not, friends, 
because the visual arts scene is 
alive and well in the city with a 
smile.
“Pray For Me I Drive Route 30” 
is Richard Stoner’s color photog­
raphy exhibition. Stoner has docu­
mented the once-significantRoute 
30 between Pittsburgh and 
Bedford. The highway, which was 
one of the first to run across the
United States, became known for 
its coverage of a vast expanse of 
land, its scenic regional land­
scapes, and as a principal trans- 
Appalachian route. Strange mix. 
Most of the route’s significance, 
however, was taken away by the 
Pennsylvania Turnpike. Stoner, 
a Latrobe native, focuses on fifty 
years of social “responses to the 
highway,” or what he refers to as 
“human designs on the land­
scape.” Interestingly enough, the 
photographer sums up the show 
as “Henry Ford meets Henry
David Thoreau.”
Imagine watching a swamp 
from “dawn to dusk” for six years. 
David Haas, an Allentown resi­
dent, concentrated his photogra­
phy on this topic between 1982 
and 1988. Haas has documented 
the last man-made protected wa­
tershed which spans over 50,000 
acres. Of course, every trivia 
master should recognize this one 
as the Quabbin Reservoir in 
Massachusetts. The reservoir, 
which is inaccessible to the pub­
lic, could only be photographed
after Haas received special state 
privileges. Throughout his excur­
sion, the photographer discovered 
old building foundations, unfin­
ished road beds, numerous grave­
stones, and 412 billion gallons of 
pure water.
Both of these photography 
showings will be held at Blatant 
Image • Silver Eye, located on 1015 
East Carson Street. The exhibit 
runs until October 7 and the hours 
for each show are Wednesday 
through Saturday, 12 to 5 pm.
The Filmmakers at the Fulton
will be showing The Festival of 
Animation until Thursday. This 
brand-new 1989 version includes 
16 films of various lengths and 
topics. According to Dorinda 
Hughes, public relations director 
for the Fulton Theatre and the 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers, the fes­
tival promises to be a “fun night 
out” that “appeals to a wide vari­
ety [of people].” Included in this 
screening are stand-outs “How to 
Kiss,” “Superman,” and “Tin Toy.” 
The latter, the first computer-ani­
mated piece ever to win the Oscar
wSh fpFF
for best animated short film, was 
produced by John Lassiter’s cele­
brated Pixar company. Pixar has 
also produced “Luxo Jr.” and 
“Red’s Dream,” two other ac­
claimed computer-animated 
shorts that past Festival-goers 
will remember.
Following The Festival of Ani­
mation, the Fulton Theatre will 
open the viewing of the highly 
awaited Australian film, The 
Navigator. Winner of six Austra­
lian Oscars (including Best Fea-

Wings Of Desire
Are you easily intimidated by subtitles? Well, be 
brave and go see Wings of Desire. Maybe West 
German director Wim Wenders can change your 
mind with his lyrical, beautifully photographed 
piece about a pair of angels. These divine beings 
have the gift of flight and the ability to hear the 
thoughts of mortals, but they can do nothing to 
affect the world, or to alleviate the deep, emotional 
suffering that they witness. Both yearn for the 
passion of a human life, but only one relinquishes 
his immortality to realize that dream. Actor Peter 
Falk plays himself, hut with a delightful twist. The 
movie runs sometimes like a ballet, sometimes like 
a romance, and sometimes like a comedy, but 
through it all, Wings ofDesire retains its cinematic 
majesty and its quiet beauty.
At 6, 8:30,11 —Not Rated. In German, French, 
and English; subtitled.

New York Stories
Watch New York Stories and three fabulous di­
rectors will give you three wonderful movies for the 
price of one. First, Martin Scorsese’s Life Lessons 
tells the gripping tale of the conflicts between an 
aging artist (Nick Nolte) and his young assistant 
(Rosanna Arquette). Next, Francis Coppola gets 
sentimental about Life Without Zoe, a semi-auto­
biographical vignette of the rich, precocious pre- 
teen Zoe and the various lonely characters she 
befriends. Devotees ofLate Night with David Letter- 
man should watch for Chris Elliot in a cameo ap­
pearance.
The gem of this movie lies at the end, a segment 
called Oedipus Wrecks. Woody Allen finds yet 
another angle on the neurotic Jewish man who is 
addicted to therapy but uncomfortable with change. 
His pushy mother (hilariously portrayed by Mae 
Questel, the voice of Betty Boop) finds her ordinary 
powers of persuasion aren’t enough to get her son to 
dump a shiksa and settle down with a nice girl, so 
she ... well, we wouldn’t spoil the hilarious surprise 
of this film. Fans will get a fresh look at the 
traumatized Allen they love.

Fletch Lives
Chevy Chase returns to his role as the poor man’s 
James Bond in Fletch Lives. Fletch may not be 
licensed to kill, but the Los Angeles investigative 
reporter is a master of disguise. Based on the series 
of novels by Gregory McDonald, this sequel to the 
original Fletch has Mr. I.M. Fletcher heading out of 
L.A. to the Deep South, where he can collect his 
inheritance, flirt with Julianne Phillips, tangle 
with television evangelists, wade through toxic 
waste, and solve another mystery. The comedy is 
playfully witty, Chase is remarkable in his string of 
bizarre characterizations, and the movie should 
prove an ideal way to unwind from a hard week of 
studying.

Take The Money And Run
Take The Money And Run is Woody Allen’s first 
full-length film, and one of his best. Done in the dry 
style of a documentary, Allen plays the incompe­
tent thief Virgil. The story begins with a look back 
at his childhood as a nerdy scapegoat. He soon 
graduates from attempts to rip off gumball ma­
chines to plans to rob jewelry stores and banks. In 
one of the film’s many classic scenes, bank employ­
ees are unable to read Virgil’s stick-up note and 
have to pass it from person to person to try to 
decipher Virgil’s handwriting.
Scenes like that are spliced with interviews from 
Virgil’s friends and family, most of whom wear a 
Groucho nose and glasses to protect their identi­
ties. Diane Keaton co-stars as the loyal, supportive 
wife. The film is a steal at $1 a ticket.

The Fiberarts ’89 International 
show opened at the Galleria in 
Mt. Lebanon on September 15, 
and the show will continue 
through October 8. Sponsored by 
the Fiberarts Guild of Pittsburgh, 
the show is now in its fifteenth 
year of featuring works from all 
areas of fiber-oriented art.
The Fiberarts Guild of Pitts­
burgh is a non-profit organiza­
tion whose goals are “to develop 
and perfect the art of needlework 
and all other forms of fiber art by 
those practicing it; to provide a 
forum for the comparison and 
interchange of ideas, design, tech­
nique, and workmanship; and to 
sponsor and conduct, without 
profit, showings of quality fiber 
art.”
The show is spread out on the 
first two levels of the Galleria in 
numerous glass display areas. On 
opening night, the cello and piano 
music added to the already highly 
artistic environment.
The term “fiberart” might im­
ply that the show features fabric 
art exclusively. Untrue; paper and
wood are also considered fibers 
and are included in the show. The 
diversity of the show is incredible 
— there are 72 works from 17 
countries represented, two from 
the area. The pieces range from 
hand woven silk to quilted cotton, 
woven bamboo, felted wool, 
formed paper, and much more.
The first prize piece, “Pilgrim’s 
Chronicle: Prelude,” was done by 
Lynda Lowe from Wheaton, Illi­
nois. Lowe went to art school in 
Indiana and she has been show­
ing her hand-felted wool pieces in 
galleries ever since. The winning 
piece was part of a series of five 
works. Lowe compared the indi­
vidual pieces to “pages in her 
diary.”
Another interesting artist was 
Stephen Beal, from Evanston, 
Illinois, who works in needlepoint. 
He finds it difficult to be accepted
as an artist being in fiber, as many 
craftsmen do, but that is chang­
ing, thanks to groups like the 
Fiberarts Guild of Pittsburgh.
The show at the Galleria will be 
hanging from September 16 to 
October 8, Mondays to Saturdays,
10 am to 9:30 pm, and Sundays,
11 am to 5 pm. Enjoy a few hours 
of artistic enlightenment and 
quality work at Fiberarts ’89 In­
ternational.
Linda Owen’s “Pilgrim’s Chronicle:Prelude” is on display at the Galleria.
