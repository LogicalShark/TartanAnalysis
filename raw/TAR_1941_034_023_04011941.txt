Bill 46464646 
Gives Governor 
Charge of Insane
In a surprise move just as this 
edition was going to press, the 
State Legislature passed Bill 
number 46464646 late yetserday. 
This bill was an enabling act per­
mitting the governor to “do as he 
saw fit” in regards to the new 
State Psychiatric Hospital on the 
edge of the Pitt Stadium in Oak­
land.
The governor immediately no­
tified the TARTAN that, as an 
economy measure, the hospital 
would be turned over to Carnegie 
for use as a Student Union, if 
the Institute would agree to 
equip it for such use.
In exchange, the school would 
donate the Fine Arts building on 
the campus to the state, to be 
used as a mental hospital.
In his message by long distance 
phone, the governor explained 
that the cost of equiping the new 
building in Oakland was delaying 
the opening of the structure as a 
hospital, and since it had not yet 
been furnished, the state would 
be glad as an economy measure, 
to secure some structure already 
equipped, however small, rather 
than go to the immediate ex­
pense of furnishing the building.
He further pointed out that the 
number of mental cases at the 
present time did not warrant such 
a large building as the new hos­
pital. In this instance, he pointed 
out that the Arts Building was 
already well stocked with mental 
cases. The legal angles of com­
mitment to an institution could 
be disposed of by the simple ex­
pedient of padlocking the exits.
It is strange, perhaps, that the 
governor made no differentiation 
between the faculty and the stu­
dents of the Arts building. The

Tech’s “Brains” 
Unable to Solve 
Student’s Problem
I am only a lowly freshman re­
porter. I never asked to be on 
the TARTAN anyway. I was 
just walking calmly along Maggie 
Murph St., minding everyone’s 
business when someone stuck a 
pencil in my ear and well—there 
I was. They asked me if I had 
had newspaper experience and I 
answered in the definite affirma­
tive. I didn’t tell them that all 
I had ever done was compile the 
honor roll in high school.
Well, right off the bat they gave 
me an assignment—poor little me 
who didn’t know from nothing. 
They said to me, they said, 
“Fresh—being as you’re new here, 
your first assignment will be an 
easy one.” So they took me in a 
corner and cautiously whispered 
the dreaded news into my unsus­
pecting ear. When they had fin­
ished, I gasped, “No, no”—they 
couldn’t do that to me. I was 
young, inexperienced—oh, my life 
—my future was ruined. But 
true to the code of my ancestors 
—I carried on. With head high, 
spirited undaunted, I marched 
over to the Administration Hall. 
On the way I collided with a very 
impressive looking senior.
“Kind sir,” I said. “Would you 
be good enough to tell me . . . 
etc.” He glared unbelievingly at 
me, uttered a frightened cry and 
scampered off across the cut. Not 
to be squelched, I trudged on to­
wards Administration. With a 
great deal of difficulty I pushed 
the glass doors open, and walk­
ed up to some jane in the Dean’s 
outer office and cautiously relay­
ed my story to her. She turned 
startled eyes on me, patted my 
hand and said,
“My dear child, I feel deeply 
sorry for you but in my present 
capacity I am afraid I’m un­
authorized to make any state­
ment. I am afraid you will have 
to ask Dean Warden.” So there 
I was in the inner office. Hav­
ing whispered my plea into his 
cute Qittle ear, I found him star­
ing at me with serious eyes.
“Young lady, this is a very 
grave matter and one that re­
quires careful and tactful 
handling. In fact I am afraid it

Foot Notes
Tear Dance Today 
On AXA’s Hot Floor
Thirty workmen have been 
busily at work for a week and a 
half filling in the ravine in 
Schenley Park, which is some­
times called Panther Hollow. The 
work was begun because of the 
evident need for a dance floor 
larger than any available in the 
city to accommodate the huge 
crowds expected to attend the Al­
pha Chi Alpha tear dance this 
afternoon from 4:30 to midnight.
An outdoor dance floor was de­
cided upon because it would elim­
inate the necessity for couples to 
“go for a walk in the park” dur­
ing the dance. The soft coal fin­
ish which tbps the filler was chos­
en mostly because of its smooth 
surface for dancing, and second­
ly because of its heating quali­
ties. If Mr. Dorsey or Mr. Clinton 
desires that the dancers are not 
giving out with enough jive, etc., 
they can take care of that easily 
enough by simply tossing a cig­
arette onto the floor. Also, if the 
weather turns a bit chilly, the A 
Ex A girls can warm things up 
by applying a large kitchen match 
to one of the coals.
Tickets, which have been sell­
ing for twenty-three cents, will 
not be on sale at the door, but 
upon presentation of membership 
in the Goober’s Club, any student 
will receive eighty-four cents in 
silver dollars.
Dates De Luxe
The Eta Bet Zi’s wish to an­
nounce the formation of their new 
date bureau. A bevy of sylph­
like figures have been signed up 
to go out at five dollars per head. 
Tech men will probably consider 
the cost extravagant but first re­
ports from satisfied customers 
show that even Tech prefers qual­
ity to quantity. A “dress” parade 
of these modelettes will be held 
at Thistle Hall this afternoon. The 
real unveiling will lake place 
later, to be announced. Reserva­
tions should be made as early as 
possible..
Brains Vs. Brawn
Free Beer
Starting tomorrow evening, and 
lasting for the duration of the 
school year, the University Grill, 
better known as “The Greeks” 
or “The Ranch,” will serve free 
beer and liquor to Tech students. 
There will also be a floor-show 
every evening from 7:00 to 9:00 in 
an effort to take the students 
away from their work. Baum 
Boulevard Rosie will be starred in 
the show.
New Rule Bars 
Girls From Frats 
Until After 2 A. M.
Due to. a new ruling by the 
Regulations Committee, women 
will not be allowed in fraternity 
houses at Tech until after 2:00 
A. M. This was made necessary 
because—you know why!—no one 
is in a fraternity house at Tech 
until that time.
According to latest reports from 
Dr. Darden and Mrs. Gone, 
Tech’s Deans of Men and of Wo­
men, it seems that one of the 
fraternity men stole Sally Rand’s 
fan while she was a guest of the 
fraternity for dinner. The facul­
ty believes that the hours before 
and after dinner are the most 
dangerous ones for a girl to be in 
a house unchaperoned. It is also 
believed that no one should want 
the company of a young lady un­
til after '2:00.
Another untoward situation 
which caused the passage of this 
ride was the fact that for several 
years fraternities have been in­
viting girls to their houses for 
breakfast. The faculty believes 
¦this practice should be stopped, 
for 7:00 A. M. is entirely too ear-r 
ly to get up in the morning, esj 
pecially when one must eat 
breakfast with the very students 
that he will teach at 8:30. Accord­
ing to several of the professors, 
they had been called out of bed 
at six o’clock in the morning after 
a hard night to chaperon girl 
house-guests at several of the 
houses for breakfast. It had be­
come so bad that several of the 
Tech teachers were unable to 
present their subjects effectively 
because their minds were fogged 
from lack of sleep and too much 
beer. Several profs were discov­
ered massaging the skin under

Tonight in Madison Square 
Garden, two bitter rivals will vie 
for the world’s heavyweight 
championships before a crowd 
expected to exceed 10,000. Kid 
Warner, two-fisted exponent of 
scientific jabbing will meet Slug 
Hotchkiss, Falk-killer in fifteen 
rounds of boxing.
Warner showed up at the 
weighing-in in a form-fitting yel­
low sports coat, green tie, purple 
shirt and slacks. “This coat came 
with two pair of pants,” he 
proudly said. The Kid weighed 
224 pounds stripped.
Hotchkiss looked quite deject­
ed as he stepped on the scales. 
His manager, “Happy” Hower, 
would give the press no state­
ment. on his man’s condition, but 
the fact that he handed Slug a 
glass of bicarbonate seems to in­
dicate that the fighter had been 
on a binge the night before. Kid 
Warner extended his hand in a 
friendly gesture, but could not 
reach the ceiling where Hotchkiss 
had gently floated. Obviously em­
barrassed, Hower pulled his boy 
down and took him back to 
training quarters.
Warner has been training for 
two months at a famous Ohio re­
sort on Route 22 West. Fight fans 
have been flocking there at a dol­
lar a head to watch the Kid mash 
the sparring partners to shreds. 
Among the toughest of the spar­
ring partners is Big Bill Michener 
whom Warner has beaten so Jjjlly 
that he wobbles around like a 
mouse in a psychology experi­
ment. Yet Bill comes back for 
more. It is men like these who 
nave contributed to the Kid’s 
power and stamina.

An important news-ilash has 
come into the TARTAN ofllce: a 
report of alarming significance to 
the welfare of the Tech student 
body. As reported to the office 
by a mysterious wig-wag message 
wiggled and waggled to us from 
the top floor of Maggy Murph, 
two freshmen women have been 
found dead of asphyxiation in the 
Margaret Morrison smoking-room.
Two weeks ago the girls disap­
peared, from a chemistry-lab., 
leaving a message that they had 
gone to test the impurities in Mag­
gy Murph air. A few minutes 
after they left the lab. a pungent 
odor pervaded the halls, some­
what similar to the smdll of burn­
ing flesh. But, since this odor 
emanates from the smoking-room 
quite frequently because the ah’ is 
so thick with smoke that no-one 
can see the end of her cigarette 
when .she is lighting it, no investi­
gation was pursued.
Yesterday, however, one of the 
senior social-workers, upon enter­
ing the smoking-room, stumbled 
over an inert object for the fifth 
time this week. She pulled out 
her pocket-flashlight, which is 
standard equipment for Maggy 
Murph smokers, and saw the blue 
faces of the missing girls. She, 
being a true social-worker, is 
turning her discovexy into a wea­
pon for reform of the burning is­
sue of the smoking-room, by 
threatening to make her discovery 
public if the matter is not imme­
diately remedied.
To hush the scandal and the 
smell of the whole situation the 
administration has agreed to al­
low the girls to smoke in the halls 
of Margaret Morrison and in the 
Recreation Hall. Burial for Lite 
two martyrs will take place to­
morrow at 6:00 a. m. in the front 
lawn of the Arts School. Please 
omit all flowers except tobacco- 
leaves.

mittently training in Thistle HalL 
It was necessary for the euryth- 
mics classes to be moved to the 
men’s gymnasium, but this was 
quite satisfactory to the parties 
concerned. Hotchkiss finds it dif­
ficult to keep the training rules, 
and he is often found draped 
around the bar of the University 
Grill. Due to his greater expe­
rience, however, this may not be 
a serious setback. It is said that 
Hotchkiss has a deadly ten-inch 
punch which might stop Warner 
in the first or second round of the 
fight.
Unscrupulous gamblers, in 
tiying to raise odds on Warner, 
have intimated that Hotchkiss 
wears a girdle. Inside sources, 
however, maintain that his man­
ly physique is in no way depend­
ent on a two-way stretch. “I hold 
my sagging muscles in with dy­
namic tension,” was Hotchkiss’s 
statement on this point. Slug 
weighed 235.5 pounds this after­
noon before he took the bicar­
bonate.
Both men will receive feminine

Curtailment
Saltpetre Cut 
For Girls’ Dorms
Blame it on the defense pro­
gram! Due to excessive need of 
salt-petre for munitions by the 
staunch defenders of American 
freedom and motherhood who 
constitute our army, supplies of 
that vital drug have been severely 
curtailed for civilian use.
Due to the scarcity of supply, 
school authorities met the emer­
gency at the beginning of last 
week by rationing out salt-petre 
to the girls’ dorms.
Repercussions immediately oc­
curred, with bedlam breaking out 
all over the campus. Inmates of 
the women’s dormitories are re­
ported to be plotting against au­
thorities in an attempt to curtail 
curfew regulations. Mrs. Yon, 
when asked for a statement, said, 
“The purity of Carnegie woman­
hood must be preserved at all 
costs, even if it means a- strait- 
jacket for every Maggie Murphy.”
Most serious outbreak of the 
week occurred in Forbes Hall late 
Saturday afternoon when three co­
eds broke olit through a second 
floor window upon seeing Chang 
Dunn pass by, and pursued the 
unfortunate lad for a mile down 
Forbes St. As we go to press, 
neither Chang nor any of the girls 
have been located within a five 
mile radius of Skibo.
Housemothers, appalled at the 
unforeseen reactions, plan to for­
mulate instruction courses about 
the birds and bees, in order to 
forestall any embarassing compli­
cations.
Sunderland Returns
Last year the TARTAN spon­
sored a man by the name of 
George B. Sunderland for Presi­
dent of the United States. Early 
this morning Mr. Sunderland 
(Sunny to his friends) was seen 
on the campus by a TARTAN re­
porter.
Upon arriving at the TARTAN 
office George informed his friend 
of the moment that he had re­
turned to Tech to teach a course 
in Running for President and 
Succeeding. Late returns from 
Girty’s Gulch, Pa., indicate *>n 
overwhelming victory for “Sun­
ny.”

Tuition and fees will be reduc­
ed by fifty dollars as of the pres­
ent year, H. R. Patton, Controller 
of the1 Institute, announced Friday 
afternoon. The slash is due to the 
marked increase in return on En­
dowment Fund investments and 
the receipt . of several largo 
monetary gifts.
“The defense program is large­
ly responsible for this change in 
our financial status,” Mr. Patton 
said. He attributed the monetary 
gifts to a desire to see engineering 
education expanded to meet the 
present crisis.
Rather than waiting until Sep­
tember to make the decrease ef­
fective, the Executive Board has 
decided to refund fifty dollars to 
all presently enrolled student 
and to make the reduction 
permanent at the beginning of the 
new year.
In order to facilitate book­
keeping, refunds will be made 
only during the present week. Stu­
dents will receive a fifty dollar 
check upon presentation of their 
registration receipt at * the 
Cashier’s Office in Administration 
Hall.
“This is evidence that Carnegie’s 
purpose is first and foremost serv­
ice in education,” Mr. Patton said 
in announcing the Executive 
Board’s decision.
U. of Pittsburgh 
Absorbs C. I. T.
Tech students will be surprised 
and gratified to learn that the 
board of directors has finally suc­
ceeded in bringing about a mer­
ger of Carnegie Tech with the 
University of Pittsburgh. A deci­
sion assuring this long-contem­
plated action was finally reached 
at a joint directors’ meeting last 
night. As was to be expected, 
Tech will lose all nominal iden­
tity in the amalgamation, for the 
name will continue to be “The 
University of Pittsburgh,” this 
time applying to the combine.
The decision to amalgamate 
marks the culmination of nego­
tiations initiated by Tech and be­
gun early in the year. The con­
tinuous diminution of prestige 
which Carnegie has been expe­
riencing for the past three years 
has made it most desirable that 
the school become identified with 
an institution of higher repute 
and a more optimistic outlook to 
the future. As is to be expected 
in an action so preponderantly 
favoring Tech, the latter will be 
required to make numerous con­
cessions t)f property and curric­
ulum. The Fine Arts department, 
which has suffered the greatest 
setback in rating and whose 
buildings and equipment have be­
come so sadly dilapidated due 
to lack of maintenance funds, will 
be razed and replaced by a large 
and beautiful blue grass lawn to 
be used as a summer promenade 
for the students. The Engineer­
ing School will continue to func­
tion as such; however, it will be 
used as a “prep” school for those 
aspiring to enter the engineering

New Coal Process 
Reversed To Give 
Idaho Potatoes
Britain no longer needs to fear 
the German blockade. It is now 
unnecessary for English ships to 
risk encountering enemy submar­
ines in coming to the United States 
for foodstuffs. Because of a pro­
cess recentily devised by Dr. Ernest 
Berl, noted Carnegie Tech sci­
entist, Britain will be able to man­
ufacture her own food from coal 
mined in English fields.
When elaborating on his meth­
od for converting potatoes into 
coal. Dr. Berl accidently turned 
the paper containing the calcu­
lations up-side down. It occured 
to him that if the paper right side 
up would produce coal from pota­
toes perhaps the inverted paper 
would convert coal into potatoes. 
He tried the experiment and 
achieved remarkable success.
It is expected that coal-to-po- 
tato factories will spring up all 
over the country. Pittsburgh coal 
will be first converted into pota­
toes and then burned. The smoke 
menace can thus be eliminated, 
but burnt potatoes smell like hell. 
Dr. Berl is working on that now.
This discovery is considered to 
be the one factor that will win 
the war for Britain. Dr. H. H. 
Lowry has shown that it is possi­
ble to predict the kind of potatoes 
that will bo produced by the dif­
ferent types of coal. According to 
Dr. Lowry, bituminous coal will 
glvo Irish potatoes while anthra­
cite coal will yldld Idaho spuds.
Tho Japanese government is 
making desperate efforts to se­
cure the plans for this process 
and little yellow men may be 
seen following Dr. Berl around. 
The doctor has sworn off strong 
waters as a result, but the llttlu 
ydilow men are still there. The 
Japs tried to reverse the older 
Berglus process for making arti­
ficial coal from grass, but all they 
could obtain was Smorgasbord. 
When fed with this, the Jap 
soldiers were forced to use so 
much ex-lax that tho Japanese 
budget for the fiscal year of 1.040 
was greatly exceeded.
So important is Dr. Berl’s ac­
complishment considered by the 
British government that he will be 
made a Knight of the Order of 
the Garter by King. George VI in 
Westminister Abbey on April 17 
at 4:30. “My stockings are always 
falling down anyhow,” said Dr. 
Berl modestly when asked what 
ho thought of the great honor to be 
conferred upon him.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, APRIL 1, 1941
Students Essentially Honest
Dear Editor:
It is a common idea that col­
lege students are completely 
without moral scruples. I am ask­
ing you, therefore, to publish the 
enclosed letter and my reply 
thereto, lest a shadow dast there­
by on our unsullied reputations 
remain unchallenged and un­
cleansed by the pure light of pub­
licity.
Very truly yours,
JOE T. COLLITCH. 
Astorbilt House; New York 
Mr. Joe T. Collitch,
Carnegie Tech,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Dear Sir:
Upon making the customary 
room inspection immediately af­
ter a guest’s departure, our 
housekeeper advises that two 
brown woolen blankets, replace­
ment value $8.00 each were miss­
ing from the. room you occupied.
May we respectfully ask that 
when unpacking your luggage 
should this article be noted, we 
will appreciate it if you will re­
turn same at once. Guests fre­
quently, We find, in their haste to 
depart, inadvertently place such 
items in their effects, and, of 
course, immediately return same 
when discovered.
Allow us to emphasize our ap­
preciation of your esteemed pa­
tronage and we trust we may 
have the distinct pleasure of serv­
ing you often in the future.
Yours very truly,
OWATT A. SOWERPUSS, 
Asst. Manager.
Dear Mr. Sowerpuss:
I am indeed desolated to learn 
after reading your extremely 
tactful letter of March 30, that 
you actually cater to guests at 
your hostelry who are absent
minded enough to check out and 
include such slight tokens of your 
esteem as wool blankets, replace­
ment value of $8.00 each, when 
repacking the other necktie and 
the soiled shirt.
By the same token, I suppose 
that passengers of some of our 
leading railroads are apt to carry 
off a locomotive and a few pull­
mans, together with mile or so 
of rail, when disembarking from 
the chew-choo on reaching their 
destinations, or, visiting the Zoo, 
might conceivably tijike away an 
elephant or rhinoceros by con­
cealing same in a sack of pea­
nuts—after removing the nuts 
(replacement value of $.05).
In this particular case I may 
be of Slight assistance to you in 
running down your recalcitrant 
blankets (replacement value $8.00 
each). As I had a great deal of 
baggage with me, I needed all the 
drawer space that you so thought­
fully provide in each room. The 
blankets in question occupied the 
bottom drawer of the dresser and 
I wanted to place some white 
shirts (replacement value $3.50 
each) in that drawer, so I lifted 
the blankets out and placed them 
on a chair. Later a maid came and 
I handed them, (same blankets 
and same replacement value), to 
her, telling her in a nice gentle­
manly way to get them the hell out 
of here. If you’Q count all the 
blankets in your esteemed estab­
lishment, you’ll find that all are 
present and accounted for,—un­
less other absent minded guests 
have been accommodated at your 
emporium in the meantime. That’s 
the best I can do.
Yours very truly,
JOE T. COLLITCH.
P. S.: Have you counted all the el­
evators lately?

The faculty wishes to accept re­
sponsibility for all opinions ex­
pressed'’in this issue. We have 
read the copy and it is indicative 
of the treatment we give our sub­
jects in the classroom. We heart­
ily endorse the progressive atti­

intend to cooperate in every way 
with its policy of editorialism.

Marriage Lab 
Aids Technique
Most interesting part of the 
Marriage Relations course taught 
by Professor Risedorph is the 
Marriage Relations Lab located 
across from the Women’s Locker 
Rooms where theories are tested 
out and students And a place to 
turn their ideas into action. Those 
who have taken the course admit 
that this Lab was the most re­
vealing and vital experience in 
their college career.
Two Venetian blinds cover the 
windows and may be drawn shut 
for privacy. Professor Risedorph 
says that tests have shown that 
students work better in the dark. 
Three couches, a large number of 
roomy chairs'big enough for two, 
and a small reading Uamp in an 
isolated part of the room consti­
tute the equipment. The reading 
lamp is for those who are just 
beginning the course and have 
not begun the heavier assignments.
A large cupboard contains 
books by the greatest authorities 
in the world on marriage, such as 
.Barbara Hutton, John Barrymore, 
and the Duchess of Windsof. Idly 
glancing over the titles, we saw: 
“The Technique of Kissing,” “The 
Approach in Three Easy Lessons,” 
and “What. To Do When Your 
Mother-in-Law Comes For A 
Visit and Remains A Year.” Try­
outs for next semester are being 
held now; so smooth the rough 
spots in your technique.
march, refuses to comply with the 
order and anyone with a working 
knowledge of goosestepping 
will easily see why. It has been 
suggested that the band be made 
up entirely of women, and then, 
we feel, all legitimate objections 
will be eliminated.
Contest Postponed
The challenge to compete our 
“lovelies” in a beauty contest will 
have to be reneged on, as we have 
no one to enter even against the 
poorest competition. We suggest 
the Steffen fund be expanded to 
include some “stuff.”
Hillbilly Teaches 
Social Relations
The administration announced 
yesterday that Mr. Owen, econo­
mist and teacher of social rela­
tions, is a fugitive hillbilly from 
the Ozark Mountain police, want­
ed for violating statute No. .002 
of the corn liquor laws of the 
Ozarks. Mr. Owen has been taken 
into custody and is awaiting the 
arrival of the Sheriff.
The letter which the adminis-v 
tration received from the Ozark 
sheriff was handed over to the 
TARTAN to be made public. The 
letter read as ¦¦follows: 
deer sir:
we hav just discuvered that 
Lyle Owen who wuz once a 
resident of the ozarks is a 
teacher in yer collich. this yar 
letter is to tell ya that he is a 
mizzable critter and is dan­
gerous. i is a comin after him 
and woud appreshiate it if ya 
wuz to hold him till i get thar. 
we want him fer stealin good 
ozark corn liquor and sellin 
it fer hair tonic, lies a slicker 
too, and has been known to 
take out bootiful inocent gals 
wuf wooing as his objeck an 
not bringin’ em back—inocent. 
he calls hiself a intellektuol, 
so natcherly you better lock 
him up till i get thar.
thanxalot-hezekiah coy,
sheriff
When asked to make a state­
ment all Mr. Owen would reply 
was “I wuz framed!”
The latest rage, fe’Ilows, is that 
unique invention by the Bell Tel­
ephone Co. known as Voder. They 
have been enlarged to life-like 
proportions, a slim chassis has 
been built around them, and the 
revolutionary girl of tomorrow has 
just been born.
Rosie is the modern version of 
the iron maiden. Made of flesh 
resembling alloy, and with those 
dulcet Voder tones she just about 
knocks your eye out. Several of 
the men who made her have com­
plained that her perfectionist fam- 
ininity is not true to life, but the 
general opinion is that the only 
difference to be allowed in Rosie is 
that she won’t be able t6 say no. 
All the advertising for this lus­
cious female has already been 
drawn up, and will soon blossom 
along the highways. “No man can 
be without one,” will be viewed 
under the photograph of the per­
fect specimen, and the alluring 
come hither look that comes from 
under her delicate lashes breaks 
down all sales resistance.
At a demonstration given for 
the Tech faculty, only blondes 
were used which attests to the in­
corruptibility of our august body. 
Dr. Doherty has taken the stand 
that no student will be allowed to 
own a Rosie. The price is out of 
reach of the students of moderate 
means, and the ones in the labs 
will be sufficient for the whole 
student body.
There is general agitation among 
the women to either boycott Rosie 
or have some male Ronalds pro­
duced. Social scientists have pre­
dicted that the human race will 
undoubtedly die out. On the con­
trary, Voders can reproduce 
themselves and a nation of super­
men will result.
It has been suggested that these
Cwens Hold Teas
Freshmen have recently been 
entertained by a series of teas 
covering the past four weeks and 
sponsordd . by Cwens. The teas 
were boresome affairs and every­
body was busy noting what Jean 
or Sally had on. Mrs. Spittlefield 
poured at the teas and did a bad 
job of it too. We have it on good 
authority that Mrs. Spittlefidld’s 
hangovers are responsible for her 
peculiar disposition. The tea was 
too watery, and the cookies of 
an inferior quality.
Since the teas, approximately 
fifty freshmen have come down 
with St. Vitus’ Dance, which 
authorities tell us was caused by 
the improper methods used in 
washing the cups. All agreed that 
this year’s project was \tlie least 
successful in recent years.

The announcement by the ad­
ministration that students would, 
be allowed to audit classes has 
had several unexpected ramifica­
tions.
Sergeant Sommers, more famil­
iarly known to all ROTC students 
as “Old Sourpuss,” read the an­
nouncement (he can read, you 
know) and decided to avail, him­
self of this opportunity. Splendid 
linguist, that he is, he, however, 
decided to take the Voice and 
Speech course which. is given to 
the Freshmen Dramats in order 
that he might more vociferously 
denounce those ROTC students 
who are unfortunate enough to 
have their hats set .002 inches off 
the standards prescribed by the 
ROTC Manual.
When asked for his opinion of 
the Voice and Speech course, Sgt. 
Sommers typically remarked:

You can’t fool a little feathered 
friend about spring migrations! The 
smart bird knows that Greyhound 
is the easiest way to flit home to the 
family nest and back to college 
again when vacation time’s over. 
The saving is plenty big—in both 
time and money — and the trip’s 
more fun in a Super-Coach full of 
friends. There’s an extra saving, as 
usual, on round-trip tickets. So be 
kind to your pocketbook—and to 
yourself—go Greyhound.

After two years of struggle, the 
noble experiment is at an end, 
and social relations is to go. E702, 
the only thing that gave the 
course dignity, has had its requi­
em sung an dthe math depart­
ment has even been cautioned to 
use the number only when abso­
lutely necessary- The idealistic 
dream of awakening a social con­
sciousness in budding engineers 
has been interpreted in Freudian 
concepts, and subsequently con­
demned. Margaret Morrison is 
celebrating, thinking that all the 
unfulfilled desires of social rela­
tions will now be directed toward 
her. The engineers blandly go on 
their way, and sly winks are the 
only manifestations of the humor 
they feel at the attempts to hu­
manize them. They’d much pre­
fer to go back to the system of 
fishing in the old curriculum and 
taking pot luck.
Dr. Willard Hotchkiss, when 
called upon for a statement, was 
overcome as he eulogized the vain 
efforts he had put forth. Iiis lips 
trembled and a tear glistened in 
his good eye as he chokingly 
mumbled, "We just couldn’t get 
the damn sophomores to co-oper­
ate.”
The program was a tottering 
one at most, but the death-blow 
was delivered by the nasty rum­
ors that began circulating about 
it. The only one in which We place 
much credence was that it was a 
Nazi propaganda agency—no
more, no less. It has been verified 
that Mr. Turney, one of the in­
structors, does not have the blind 
staggers, but has been giving the 
Nazi salute with that clenched 
fist.
The subject matter of the 
course had been approved by the 
board of Censors and the Will 
Mays office, but the department 
got around that by getting its 
facts from the American Weekly. 
The material would read along 
smoothly, but about every third 
line, up would pop “Two ships for 
one,” a typographical error, no 
doubt, but the FBI didn’t seem 
to think so, and neither did the 
Dies Committee.
The textbooks used in the 
course are to have a public burn­
ing right after the witch-hunt 
during Spring Carnival. Every re­
minder of the plagued stuff is to 
go into the all-consuming flames.
In polling the popular opinion 
of the course, the usual answer 
to our questions was a reference 
to the Spanish bull rings. One 
bright student countered with the 
statement that, since the human 
equation could not be put on a 
graph, it did not exist, for, on 
good authority (Dr. Moskowitz), 
he knows that every equation 
must have a graph. Therefore, 
the course must deal in absurdi­
ties. The above syllogism has 
been referred to the Philosophy 
Department to check on its logic, 
and after three days, Dr. Max 
Schoen has offered no comment, 
but authority has it that the au­
thor of the brilliant statement is 
being considered for one of the 
Quiz Kids.
But all the old landmarks are 
going, and our only comment is, 
“What the Hell, Archie, another 
beer, it stimulates the mind.”

Novel Honorary 
Opens New Fields 
For Activities
. A new honorary society, the 
Delta Cwen, has been established 
to acknowledge the merits of here­
tofore unrecognized students. The 
prime object of the society is to 
encourage individual endeavor in 
the extracurricular fields. To be a 
member of the society, a student 
must be a member in good stand­
ing with Professor Kahn—office 
near Forbes and Murray—and 
must have a minimum of lid 900 
points—d being 2-3 of the in­
dividual’s waist line.
Points are to be awarded on the 
following basis: Any member of 
the Kiltie Band who can consist­
ently play flat notes will receive 
. 5 points.
Any member of any athletic 
team who completes an entire sea­
son without scoring will receive ID 
points and all athletes scoring 
points for the opposing team will 
be honorary members (Hank Hol- 
ets has just been nominated as 
president of the society). Any stu­
dent who can drink two Zombies 
and then walk a straight line will 
be awarded 10 points.
Any student who can date two 
sorority sisters (or one fellow—in 
case said student is a girl) and re­
tain an unblemished name will be 
elected Vice-President.
Reward Offered
A reward has been offered by 
the administration for the cap­
ture, dead or alive, of the person 
las seen in the Beanery adulter­
ating the food with arsenic. This 
person, is reported to be between 
5 feet and six feet tall, with 
brownish hair.

Carnegie Institute of Technology 
will be on the top of everyone's 
tongue, the lips of all the adults) 
and the minds of all young people 
between the ages of 15 and 20. 
The name Carnegie shall become 
a household word in the lives of 
the populace. Carnegie Tech, and 
I say this with Pride, will be the
scene of a now movie to bo pro­
duced b^ Metro-Goldwyn-Maycr, 
TARTAN
Briefly, the idea is to present 
life on a college campus, typically 
of course, one which is actively 
engaged in defense work and 
which has been affected by pres­
ent conditions such as the draft­
ing of numerous students, the ab­
sence of the president, the giving 
of quickie courses in engineering 
—oh, lots.
After the plan had been evolved, 
a locale was needed, one which 
actually followed the 'hypothetical , 
case. Scouts and technical men 
were sent throughout the country 
to all colleges in search of the 
school which would most fulfill 
the requirements of the p'lot and 
atmosphere. Reports of the vari­
ous men were analyzed thorough­
ly. Finally, the executives de­
cided that Carnegie Institute of 
Technology approximated most 
nearly the desired conditions.
Perhaps even more thrilling is 
the fact that students will be used 
in practically all supporting roles 
and one lucky boy will be starred 
in one of the bigger roles. Four 
Hollywood notables are to have 
the leads. As yet no information 
as to whom they are has been di­
vulged. Engineers need not be 
downcast in thinking that the 
dramats are going to monopolize 
the production. On the contrary,
I have definite word from Frank 
Borzage, who is to direct this epic, 
that engineers who can act natural, 
rather than dramats, who would 
mug all over the place, are de­
sired.
Think of the significance of this 
project .Every other school in the 
country will be envious of us. 
People who have never heard of 
Tech, and people who think of 
Carnegie as a Valley of imagina­
tion will become our most con­
scientious supporters. Every high 
school kid will make up his mind 
to come to Tech. Tales of ro­
mance and adventure will fill the 
newspapers and magazines. True 
story rags will use Tech as a basis 
for their material. Radio will 
have constant touch with us. In­
terview, plays, and programs will 
center around us; undoubtedly, a 
new radio show will be started, 
originating from the campus.
The crowning point of the en­
tire program will be a World’s 
premiere of the movie in an open- 
air theater to be built on the cam­
pus. Celebrities from the entire 
movie colony, the radio world, 
and the entertainment sphere in 
general, will attend in al'J the 
finery of a true Hollywood First- 
nighter.
Promoted to the 
Head-Janitorship
A long-awaited shake-up in the 
Physical Education Department 
finally became official late last 
night. Steve (Smoothie) Jukolon- 
oskovoskovitz,Npopular custodian, 
was advanced to head of the de­
partment, supplanting Frank 
(Fuzzy) Eyman.
Frank (Muscles) Moses was 
pro-moted to the head-janitor- 
ship, in a surprise move which 
delighted his many friends. When 
our roving reporter spotted 
“Muscles” musing over a mop in 
his new air-conditioned office ad­
joining the shower room, Mr. 
Moses gave the mop an affection­
ate pat and commented, “We’re 
just good friends.”
Mr. Juk etc. was his usual vol­
uble self in expressing his reac­
tions: “I bin stepped up an bit.” 
His first official act was to subsi­
dize ping-pong, in an attempt to 
de-emphasize woo-pitching, for 
many years Carnegie’s major 
sport. This latter move was de­
cided upon in a brave effort to di­
vert the student body’s vital .en­
ergy, to less productive but. sup­
posedly more valuable channels.
Carrying out the program to 
de-emphasize sex appeal, Ed 
Rechberger was appointed in­
structor of the modem dance 
class.
Mr. Eyman, completely broken 
up at hearing of the change, an­
nounced his intention to start life 
anew as head instructor in the 
Barbara Bopslop Body-Building 
Institute.

During President Doherty’s ab­
sence, a committee consisting of 
Webster N. (“God Bless You”) 
Jones, H. R. (Paunchy) Patton, 
and Charles (Cut Plug) Watkins, 
Chairman, has grasped the reins 
of the administration and is rap?- 
idly and most effectively revising 
the rules and regulations of the 
school.
In step with this, the Terrible 
Trumvirate has accomplished a 
plan which has been lurking in 
the backs of their minds' for quite 
some little time. The plan in­
volves a change in the schedules 
for classes. This change, which 
may at first glance seem a bit 
drastic, is mainly the brainchild 
i to “Cut Plug” Watkins.
But getting back to the new 
plan, I will first quote from 
“God-Bless You” Jones—the com- 
¦ mittee spokesman: “This commit- 
! tee realizes that the new propos- 
j al will be quite a departure from 
| the accepted school routine, but 
we feel that it will enable the 
student to make much better use 
| of his time, and will eliminate 
| numerous infantile rulings which 
J were habitually violated any- 
j way.”
The essence of the plan in­
volves a shortening of hours and 
I a change in curriculum. All 
I classes will convene at 1:30 P. M.
! and will recess at 4:30 P. M. Real­
izing, however, that three hours 
j of concentrated recitation may 
tax the mental capacities of even 
the best students, the committee 
j has authorized the commons to 
I serve beer and pretzels from 2:00 
to 4:00 and there will also be 
dancing in Thistle Hall during 
the period. Further, all labs will 
be held during the evening in­
stead of the old, outmoded cours-

j TARTAN declines to take sides 
I 6n this angle; but if the institute 
is to gain a modern, multi-storied 
Student Union at the loss of a 
few professors, the loss. is well 
I offset by the gain. Besides, the 
professors would still be in the 
same atmosphere, and could carry 
on their work as usual.
Our only objection is that the 
I new Union will be too close to 
I Pitt. This is, in a measure, offset 
by the fact that the upper floors 
will come in handy as bleachers 
for all the Pitt football games, 
without the annoyance of paying 
high admission fees. This is one of 
the points of an ideal union; plea- 
| sure for students at small cost.

Officers and enlisted men in the 
Boy Scouts of America will be 
on campus tomorrow to interview 
the Senior and Junior engineers 
who might be interested in join­
ing some branch of this service.
Dr. Webster N. Jones has de­
clared tomorrow “Boy Scout 
Day.” Classes will be dismissed 
from 8:30 to 4:30 and all senior 
and junior engineers are requir­
ed to attend a lecture to be giv­
en by Commander John G. Deed 
(G for good), head of the East 
Africa Division of the Boy Scouts 
of America. Commander Deed 
will explain opportunities to be 
had in the various branches of 
the B. S. of America.
This visit to Tech is part of a 
drive being made by the Scouts 
to secure a quot of 150,000 first 
class reserve Scouts. Of this num­
ber 100,000 are needed by the 
Trail Blazing Department, 50,000 
by the Tree Choppers and the 
Campfire Girl Division is trying 
desperately to rid itself of .70,000 
extra scouts.
A senior engineer, can, if he 
passes the physical and mental 
requirements, receive a commis­
sion immediately and go to work 
for the national emergency. 
“Nice boss!” exclaimed Com­
mander Deed, when questioned 
on this point-. Juniorsl will receive 
provisional appointments and 
full commissions when they 
graduate.
An applicant must not stand 
less than 4 feet 2. inches in his 
stocking feet and must not be less 
than thirteen years old. He must 
be pure of mind and soul and 
must know the Scout oath as well 
as the names of the original four­
teen colonies.
Starting pay in the Scouts will 
be three hundred dollars a month 
and tips for good deeds. There 
will be an extra allotment of 
$8.53 for uniform and jack knife.
Dr. Jones appeared to be very 
enthusiastic about the plan. He 
said, “I like the idea because it

Barnum Finds 
Spring Carnival 
A New Rival
This year Spring Carnival is 
going to be held on a larger, more 
spectacular scale than ever be­
fore. The calendar and program 
have been revised and classes 
will end April 30—Carnival be­
ginning Thursday morning, May 
1.
Overnight a colossal circus, so 
big that it will rival Ringling 
Bios, famous troupe, will be 
erected on the Tech campus by 
Sam Ferris’ Merry-go-round 
Company. There will be 500 per­
formers to delight the Tech stu­
dents and faculty plus 50 ele­
phants, 25 lions, scores of monk- 
eyes and tigers, 5 Gargantuas—-the 
sons of the one and only Gargan- 
tua that Ringley Bros, featured a 
few years ago, trained white mice 
from our own psychology depart­
ment, and 100 beautiful girls 
straight from Earl Carroll’s Van­
ities.
An outdoor dancing pavilion is 
going to be built after Easter va­
cation in the Carnegie Bowl, and 
Thursday night an informal dance 
will be held featuring Tommy 
Dorsey’s orchestra at one end and 
Les Brown’s band at the other.
The usual events will take 
place Friday—push-mobile races, 
canoe-tilting, crowning of the 
Carnival Queen, but Gene Krupa 
has consented to donate his serv­
ices and play for the street danc­
ing Friday afternoon.
The most sensational, super- 
colossal, and super-super-duper 
event of the Carnival will take 
place Saturday morning at pre­
cisely 11 A. M., when President 
Roosevelt will speak in the Little 
Theatre to the Tech students. 
During the afternoon he will in­
spect the defense work going on 
in Pittsburgh and at Tech, and 
Saturday night he will be present 
at the formal dance to be held in 
the main ballroom of the William 
Penn. Benny Goodman has been 
contracted for this dance, and he 
will be honored by the President 
who will present him with a silver 
loving cup for being the most out­
standing musician of the year.
Tickets will go on sale after 
Easter vacation—the exact date to 
be announced in a late issue. This 
year the price, of Carnival tickets 
has been reduced from $5.50 to 
$4.00 because of the great demand 
for big name bands,

Fashion Snoops!
By: Mollynews, Scrapnelli, and 
Lucien’s Legislong Stop! Don’t 
buy that fashion magazine. Read 
this article. If you can’t read, 
get someone to read it for you. It 
will really be worth while (The 
Editor’s Note: The opinion ex­
pressed by the writers are entire­
ly their own.)
To commence (begin is such a 
common word) at the bottom— 
girls, you will no longer have to 
buy clean saddles. They are now 
being sold dirty. Manufacturers 
have special dirtilizing machines 
which give the shoes a beautiful 
gray, greasy look that you have ’to 
strive seventy months to obtain. 
And socks—ooh, la, la—si, sn— 
oski, wa, wa!
Shoot the fashion to me, dashin 
—(this is more fun than a peck of 
potatoes). Welllllllllll to get back
to the subject at hand—or is it 
feet? Socks will definitely be worn 
this season—Hollywood green, sea 
blue, fuschia, Scottie black, et 
cetera (darn these foreigners).
Skirts will have that certain 
stunning touch. You touch them 
and you are stunned. (The pre­
ceding statement need not be 
laughed at unless you have noth­
ing else to do.) We know that 
you’ve seen those new cotton dirn­
dls that are wrapped around bam­
boo poles when not being worn 
and then are worn wrinkled. Why 
don’t you be different and wear 
the bamboo pole? Think what a 
sensation you would make and 
you could spend your whole sum­
mer at Mayview, too.
Throw away your sweaters. 
Don’t wear them and be out of 
keeping with the latest fashion 
snoops. Do you'recall that Orien­
tal rug you have on your living 
room (you know, the one Mother 
spent all of last September’s re­
lief check for) ? The girls at Hag- 
gie Turf are this spring making 
blouses of these cunning fabrics. 
To prevent itching, they wear un­
dershirts of mustard yellow.
And now, the patriotic note. 
There have been, gold eagles, sil­
ver eagles, rhinestone eagles—on 
sleeves, on pockets, on buttons. 
But don’t you be a slouch; you 
buy a live eagle and wear it in 
your bangs. This is the very last 
word.
Does this bushy fellow remind 
you of anything? Winter is over 
—get your haircut NOW.

The Tech dramatic school is ex­
pending its curriculum to include 
’ burlesque, with special emphasis 
on strip teasing and fan dancing. 
In commenting on the new addi­
tion, President Doherty said, “I 
have had my eye on this form of 
art since its infancy and I have 
watched it mature into its pleasur­
able modernity. Eventually it 
.will be the only type of theatre. 
Anyway we might just as well 
train the dramats now for the jobs 
they will hold down after gradua­
tion.”
The employment bureau says 
that there is a perennial demand 
for artists of this type. They hope 
to begin placing large numbers of 
graduates a few years from now. 
when the “class” of the dramats 
begins to improve. The students 
say that these jobs don’t pay as 
well but they’re steady. Then too, 
the legitimate complaint against 
the old theater was that the in­
itial outlay for clothes was so 
great as to make it impossible to 
get a foothold.
Speaking before the assembled 
student body, Claire Boothe, the 
famous playwright, straightfor­
wardly denounced the theater as 
“a decrepit institution when plays 
have to be taken from the seven­
teenth century before they are ac­
tually good.” Miss Boothe precip­
itated the ai’gument between bur­
lesque and the theater with her

a vain attempt to erase the

This rule, requiring girls to be 
chaperoned while in fraternity 
houses, has always beeft. in the 
Blue Book but was not enforced 
until “Pretty Boy” Scions, the 
scion of Independent social life 
at Tech, noticed that the fratern­
ities were permitted to have 
young ladies in at all hours while 
•the Dorms were not allowed this 
privilege. Feeling that the dorms 
were being neglected, he called 
the attention of the faculty to this 
“naughty situation.”
It is also believed that in the 
near future one of the sororities, 
Beta Tau L&mbda (all Dramats), 
will be invited to live in the same 
house with the boys of good old 
D. U. After all the Beetles are the 
sister sorority of the DU’s, so why 
shouldn’t they bo invited? And 
furthermore, there are no sorority 
houses on campus so the girls feel 
that they can got much more ac­
complished this way.

Odds at present are three-to-

dent Doherty has placed a bet of 
one tliousand dollars on Hotch­

Nathan “Gimpy” Miller, notor­
ious Hill district bookie. This 
rumor is confined to some ex­
tent by the fact that a slide rule 
and textbook on mechanics, bear­
ing the name “Robert Doherty,” 
are on display in a Wylie Avenue 
pawn shop.
When asked of his chances 
against Hotchkiss, the Kid said, 
“I’ll moider da bum!” Hotchkiss,

is a little above my head. I hesi­
tate to voice an opinion as I feel 
that it is not in my power to do 
so. Perhaps you had better go 
to see President Doherty. I am 
sure he can take off some time 
from his defense work to answer 
such an important question.” So 
off I went to see Pres. Doherty. I 
stood outside his door and quak­
ed. Finally after several trying 
hours, 1 was granted admission 
and after stating my case, I 
breathed a sigh of relief. Here, at 
last, would be the end of my 
quest. But I was foiled again, 
curses. Pres. Doherty had the 
power but not the knowledge. By 
that time, I was plenty burned up. 
I was so mad I was seeing plaid. 
What right had they to inflict such 
punishment on me? I wouldn’t go 
another step. So I blew up right 
in President Doherty’s face. I told 
him what I thought of this tor­
ture chamber. So he said that if 
I didn’t like school-, I could leave 
without any delay—I did—Boy, 
was I sore. And all I wanted to 
know was how long it would take 
a ma!le student from-Boss Hall to 
travel from Skibo to the Arts 
Building on skis. Life just ain't 
fair to the underprivileged.
THE SMOKE OF SLOWER-BURNING CAMELS GIVES YOU 
EXTRA MILDNESSW EXTRA COOLNESS, EXTRA FLAVOR AND
play of three seasons ago, “The 
Women.” This extravaganza that 
glorified the American girl also 
gave birth to the bubble bath. The 
theater was denuded under Miss 
Boothe’s searching speech and 
shown up in the pale sickly dil- 
lentitism which infests it. Helen 
Hayes is one of Miss Boothe’s dis­
ciples, and the jazzed version of 
“Twelfth Night” at the Nixon next 
week will undoubtedly draw a 
large part of the clientele from the 
legitimate burlesque.
It has been suggested that the 
dramats charge a slight admission 
but they refuse to prostitute 
their profession. However, in 
either case, the plays expect to 
draw huge audiences. The local 
houses claim that the school is 
using unfair tactics but the refu­
tation from the Dean of Women’s 
office said simply “We have noth­
ing to hide.”

This change was decided upon,

through morning classes anyway 
and the faculty considered it only 
fair to give students credit for 
their nocturnal activities. Al­
though the time for studying will

New Policy Will 
Include Character 
Building and Stuff
Now that the birds have start­
ed to twitter in the trees again, 
also Dr. Baker, spring practice 
has been called and everyone 
feels rosy ... In an exclusive in­
terview with the good Doctor, the 
jarring facts were revealed that 
Carnegie has changed her athletic 
policy and will now devote all 
her time to building character. No 
longer will the boys roar into a 
game with brass knuckles flying, 
but will try to be rays of sun­
shine in a field of mud and spread 
the good neighbor policy among 
one and all of their most worthy 
opponents, even Pitt.
When asked how the prospects 
were for next year under this 
new regime, Dr. Baker replied 
with a smile that he was well 
satisfied with the team as a 
group since all the boys were 
gentlemen, scholars, and peachy 
dancers, and so far this season 
no one had exhibited any fatal­
istic tendencies. When asked his 
opinion on the situation, Dr. War­
den replied, “I have nothing to 
say on the matter.”
In an exclusive interview with 
Buddy Over end, the startling and 
welcome announcement was 
made that next fall the athletic 
department would sponsor a 
“bank afternoon” at the stadium, 
the holder of the lucky athletic 
card being the winner and proud 
possessor of a beautifully em­
broidered man-hole cover.
In an exclusive interview with 
Sashweight Kuenzli, varsity 
guard of the jarring^physique, his 
opinion on the subject was ex­
pressed by a decisive “Oomph.” 
However, on questioning him 
more. fully, he replied that he 
thought the boys should be taught 
the finer things in life and should 
be made to ' work for a living 
instead of getting everything for 
nothing. He also believes that the 
beautiful pastoral scenes that will 
soon grace the. walls of the locker 
room will aid immensely in mak­
ing Doc Baker’s program a ripper.

After nearly twenty-five sec­
onds of intensive and incompre­
hensible discussion, the Interfra­
ternity Council presented to the 
esteemed Tartan Sports Staff their 
latest narcotic fantasy. ' As a re­
sult of this supernatural inquisi­
tion, a new Interfraternity Sport 
will be inaugurated. Technically 
speaking, this new event will be 
named “Wolfius a datus,” or, re­
duced to terms understandable by 
the average layman “Wolfing.” It 
was thought by this morose group 
that, since Wolfing was being car­
ried on unofficially at many par­
ties, it would be for the social 
good of all concerned if this ac­
tivity were placed on a competi­
tive basis. Such activity, the 
brains ëxplained, would certainly 
bring out the worst in a man, and 
because of this, open discussion 
would ensue on one of our more 
pressing social problems. You 
must admit this is commendable 
to a certain degree (perhaps the 
third degree).
Now, the Plan
On a designated evening each 
fraternity will throw a mammoth 
party to which all fraternity men 
are invited. Each man will bring 
a date, of his own choice, and at­
tend any party he wishes, at 
which he will promptly leave his 
date to her own resoui’ces, or bet­
ter yet, to a fraternity brother. 
The object of this tender game is 
to improve Wolfing ability in gen­
eral. Points for the prizes will be 
based on many variables, among 
which are technique, approach, 
smoothness, persistance, and many 
others too numerous and maudlin 
to mention. Naturally, no holds 
are barred, and any complaints 
from the women will be deemed 
unsociable. Both individual and 
house prizes will be given, these 
awards being solid lead loving 
cups fiïied to the brim with ar­
senic. Two outstanding campus 
personalities, namely Dr. Carroll 
and Prof. Rollich, picked because 
of their past experience and un- 
contestable eye for art, have al­
ready agreed tci judge the affair. 
In order that no one may be able 
to lift the social eyebrow, the par­
ties, will be .heavily chaperoned 
by a complete troupe from the Ca­
sino.
Sions Is Stooge 
For Mob Under 
Eyman’s Thumb
Last Sunday in an exclusive 
interview with a member of the 
school press, "Feets” Eyman (the 
local dictator declared that in 
the future the personnel of the 
intramural participants will be 
composed of those men who have 
won a major C award. This dras­
tic rule was put into effect to 
stimulate the competition, and to 
make the contests reasonably fair 
for everyone. Big Frankie went 
on to say that in his opinion the 
intramural competition has been 
experiencing a general decline 
over • the past few years due to 
the non interest of the student 
body, such condition being 
brought about by the great in­
crease of student interest in the 
slightly soiled Plaid’s intercollegi­
ate sporting program.
The history of this momentous 
event might be of interest to the 
student of Carnegie. Sponsored, 
engineered, and supported by 
“Honest” Jim Sions the plan got 
off to a strong start. At the fifth 
regular meeting of last month, the 
pride of the Civil Department 
burst his bombshell with an elo-
With the coming of Spring to 
the Beautiful, Campus of Carnegie 
our thoughts wend their way to 
the corner of Maggy and Forbes 
Sts., where the Softball artists of 
this campus will hold forth again. 
In spite of the contract signed 
by Feets Eyman’s first line of de­
fense the Intramural Bored, the 
softball lots will not be used as 
the location for the forthcoming 
War Games by the C. I. T. ROTC. 
When informed of the change in 
plans General Kuentz said quote, 
“Things is tough everywhere, but 
if we loose the use of the soft­
ball courts we will resort to the 
next best thing, namely the ATO 
front lawn. I am deeply disap­
pointed in that the 'left field of the 
softball courts were extremely 
well adapted to trench warfare.” 
Last season the competition was 
torrid, but the Irish Micks from 
Moorewood. forged ahead in he 
last lap to cop the cup from the 
Tau Delts. Well do we all re­
member that ninth inning of that 
contest; the score stood 57 to 60 
in favor of the Tau Delts in the 
last ha’lf of tht ninth, when the 
Phi Kaps began that memorial 
rally, that still leaves a bad taste 
in the mouths of all loyal Tau
quen,t nineteen minute address. 
At the conclusion of this master­
piece of forceful oratory, the en­
tire Intramural Board sprung to 
their feet shouting the praises of 
“Honest Jimmie.” Despite the 
seeming enthusiasm of the mob 
on the Intramural Board, it is be­
ing rumored that the whole thing 
was fixed by Commander Eyman 
who had quietly told his yes-men 
to. rise to the occasion or suffer 
the wrath of Eyman. When asked 
about this situation Big Frankie, 
in his typical domineering man­
ner, denied any knowledge of 
such a “fix,” and said it was 
simply the workings of a demo­
cratic system.
As further evidence that this 
event was entirely the work of 
the Board’s ace agitator, General 
Eyman pointed out that he had 
no knowledge of what this “dor- 
mamaterian” was planning to 
propose until two weeks before 
this history making meeting.
Since the formulation of this 
policy our correspondent has 
spoken to many of the members 
of the football, basketball, and 
track squads asking for their 
opinion on this new undertaking. 
Every member so quizzed came 
up with the sam'e reply, which 
boiled down results in the fol­
lowing statement, “Ugh, ugh.”
Delts. First man up for the Micks 
doubled off the right fielder’s nog­
gin while the dleanup man slug­
ged the Umpire and whistled, 
“WHERE IS MY WANDERING 
BOY TONIGHT.” The next man 
up sent a sizzling single down the 
•third base line and arrived safely 
at the first sack, the man on sec­
ond moving over to third on the 
play. At this stage of the game 
the T. Delts blew up and as the 
gleeful Phi Kaps on the side lines 
ran about throwing herring in the 
•air, the third mgn was walked 
fiLing the bases. Then came that 
Phi Rap juggernaut of power to 
the plate, “Mousey Hennessey 
known to his contemporaries as 
Eggy.” With the count at three 
and two, on the next pitch “Eggy” 
gave an ear rendering “Hail 
Mary” and smote the spheroid over 
the center fielder’s head. As the 
center fielder pursued the ball 
"Eggy” rounded the bases with 
his left garter dragging in the 
dust. The play at the plate was 
close but when the dust cleared, 
there was “Mousey” alias “Eggy” 
sitting on Home plate contentedly 
picking his nose, thus the Phi 
Kaps pulled another game out 
of the fire for someone.

lution to this vital problem. She 
and Stinky Risedorf were dining 
in style at the Greeks’ when 
Stinky suggested in a moment of 
weakness (drinking a double 
Passion Fruit Necter) that his 
boys could probably do some­
thing about this problem, and be­
sides they would be thrilled to 
death to meet the First Lady. He 
added in a mumbling tone that 
he would need a few days to con­
vince the children that Shirley 
Temple is not the first lady, but 
after that it would be clear sail­
ing. At this they both laughed 
at Stinkey’s sharp humor.
So a few days later Elly en­
tered the natural habitat of the 
aquanuts meaning the pool. She 
was so thrilled by the perform­
ance of boys’ underwater antics 
that she jumped in with them and 
showed them that she was also 
a good submarine. After this was 
over someone brought out a bot­
tle of Passion Fruit Nectar and 
smacked her over the head with 
it. Thus she was christened the 
good ship “Beaver Girl.”
When questioned, Stinkey said 
that the boys by the unusual 
knowledge of underwater condi­
tions and their depth defying 
center of gravity were probably 
the best suited to serve as this 
fleet. Plans have been made to 
have the fleet train in Stinkey’s 
bathtub so that they can hang on­
to the ring and won’t sink too 
deep.
As for the good ship “Beaver 
Girl,” she Is in dry dock at the 
moment having the barnacles 
scraped-off and a- new Sponcer 
Girdle painted on. Although 
Washington has made the ex­
press request no to mention this, 
“Beaver Girl’s” poopdeck is in 
need of extensive repairs, and 
the Black Condor has been de­
tailed to cover this event.
4DTD Over All’ 
Joyboy Delts 
Set for Cup
Editor’s note: Hold your hats, 
kids, here we go again.
At the last meeting of the Del­
ta Tau Delta Fraternity it was 
moved and approved that a new 
mantle be constructed in the right 
wing, left, of the house. The pur­
pose of this expenditure is—to 
quote the Michigan Masher, Tom 
Soddy, “To create a place to put 
the Intramural Point Trophy, 
’cause there’s nuttin’ clem odder 
guys can do about it. We’re gonna 
get dat cup.” At this point he let 
out a shriek and buried himself 
in a big red rug. That was too 
much for me so I dashed for the 
door and had to duck three jubil­
ant brothers who were swinging 
from the chandiliers.
When Dr. Warden was consult­
ed on the ad visibility of this plan, 
he bit the stem from his favorite 
Meershaum, kicked the panel 
from the front door, threw an 
ink well at Miss Bird, and said, 
“They can’t get that type of doj- 
ley to set that cup on.
If you should pass the Delt 
house please notice the large elec­
tric sign which reads—We have 
done too much for Tech, all you 
guys can go to heck, to hell with 
Dr. Doherty, to him and his au­
thority—fish fry every Friday 
night, 25 cents.

SMART NEW SPRING STYLES IN LADY DOUGLAS, S3.85 and S-1.05
Hum II 111
WAA NERTZ
Oh rapture, oh ecstacy! You 
lucky girls are going to have a 
darling new tennis court to wear 
those lovely new Spring creations 
on. Can’t, you just see yourselves 
out there making like you can play 
tennis in a pair of devastating 
Schaiperelli shorts?
. The new court will have a 
heavenly blue surface and a 
duckey hand-embroidered net for 
you to hit those ravishing little 
red balls into. And best of all, 
girls, the new court will be sur­
rounded with divinely soft divans 
for the boys to sit and watch us 
in .instead of having to park them- 
celves on that horrid grass. When 
asked her opinion of this excit­
ing new project, one of the girls, 
Iodine Flub, just looked wild­
eyed, rolled over and foamed at 
the mouth, which is her own 
quaint way of saying that she’s 
all for it.
We expect all you lovely lassies 
to come out to the ravishing pic­
nic that the WAA Board is sling­
ing. It will be held in front of 
the targets on the archery range, 
the only safe place on the cam­
pus when you female Cupids start 
shooting those darling little ar­
rows. Gin and smorgasbord .will 
be served to all. with mickey finns 
on request.
Since the nasty old Administra­
tion put the ¿lamps on our dev­
astating idea of having a love'y 
cabin out in Mother Nature’s 
delectable woods, the girls are 
planning to put their little re­
treat in that cute Theatre in the 
Fine Arts college. Then all you 
lucky girls can drop in at 11:30 
every Tuesday and enjoy the 
peace and solitude just Hike you 
were out in the lovely out-of- 
doors. Ain’t that peachy?

Shindig Is Titled 
Where’s My Watch 
Or CIock-Rohbin
Last week the editor decided 
that ail youse guys should get 
the low down on this here En­
gineers’ shindig what’s a com- 
in up on May 3. Seein as how 
I’m the ace reporter the ole euss 
says to me, he says, “Zeke, I 
want’s you to tackle this here 
Dave Pett-a-group which is 
president of the Collich of en­
gineering and find out all the 
lowdown about this here shindig.” 
Yep, that’s eggsactly what he 
says, cross my heart.
So seein as how I know this 
Petti-a-group feller has a late 
class on Monday evenin’ I waited 
for him in the bushes along the 
cut. Then when he comes out a 
school and comes by my hidin 
place I tackled him just like the 
editor said. Wall, wall we wuz 
rasslin there on the ground I 
says, “Mr. Pett-a-group, the ed 
wants to know about this here 
shindig you’re havin. Wall Dave 
spits out a mouthfull of dirt and 
he says to me.” First of all we’re 
a gonno give them a swell meal, 
w*e alius do, then we’re a gonna 
give them a swell souviner, we 
alius do, then we’re a gonna give 
them a swell floor show, we alius 
do, but this year we gonna real­
ly give out.
We got a gal which would put 
Mae West to shame, why she 
wouldn’t even speak to her, and 
when she does her bubble dance, 
fellers gather round. But our 
super-special is sumpin. All the 
lights go out, then the fellers go 
out, and after the bottles quit 
droppin, a little spot goes on an 
we see—if you want to find out 
what come out ter the banquet,
Then ho gets me down and gets 
u half nelson on my solor plexus 
so I say thank you, Mr. Pett-a-, 
group for the fine interview. 
Then I picked up my coat an hat 
and high tailed it back to the 
paper to dash oil' this here 
masterpiece. Goodby Ma.

All Males Were 
Taken From Street
The girls of M. M. (mm-mm) 
College held a stag party at Cac­
tus Hall, Saturday from 11 P. M. 
to 4 A. M. The fellers were in­
vited. The first 199 lucky gentle­
men (?) received orchids. The 
boys wore beautiful long dresses 
and the girls wore shorts (we 
means short dresses).
Music was supplied by Cing 
Brosly and sons. The band stand 
was decorated in black, black and 
black. The crystal ball was 
brought out of storage. It’s a 
shame we do not see more of this 
lovely Ball. The Hall was deco­
rated—terrible.
The orchestra played in the 
center of the floor and as usual 
the dancers crowded on to the 
band stand (You know—I think 
we are doing it backwards).

Draftees!
Job-Gal Rules To 
Undergo Revision!
Draft Board officials have rul­
ed that after his year’s service, 
the selective service draftee is 
entitled to get back his pre-draft 
job.
His automobile, is also rendered 
immune from seizure for due fin­
ance payments for the duration of 
his draft service.
The ilatest "Washington ruling 
is relative to the draftee’s lady 
friend. According to the Draft 
Board the drafted man needs pro­
tection for his heart throb.
The Draft Board has issued the 
following rulings, evasion of 
which carries a $5000 and two 
years in jail penalty—and that 
ain’t hay.
Henceforth, the girl whom is 
designated by the draftee as his 
intended is forbidden to have 
single dates. They may attend 
dances and other social activities 
in feminine society only. No tele­
phone calls may be made to the 
draftee’s gal—other than strictly 
Platonic ones.
No gifts bestowed upon the 
Service man’s gal may be repos­
sessed for the duration.
To protect innocent males, the 
Draftees intended will be issued 
a large Demblem (signifying 
Danger) to be worn prominently.
No engagements may be broken 
by the feminine participant 
therein during the enlisted man’s 
service. This is construed as dan­
gerous to the National Morale 
and akin to sabotage and Fifth 
Column work. Penalty as men­
tioned.
Any infringement of the Draft 
Board’s ruling by the Service 
man’s bespoken, beside the legal 
penalty, will render any engage­
ment, understanding, etc., null 
and void.
A serious task confronts Am­
erican Women. By doing their 
part under the Draft Board’s rul­
ing, the Service man will assume 
his duties enthusiastically. Moon­
lit nights and snappy dance tunes 
will not fill him with foreboding
At their irregularly unschedul­
ed beer guzzlin’ party the mem­
bers of the Evening College of 
The Fine Arts of Street Cleaning 
wouldn’t elect John J. Wither­
spoon Johnson as president of 
their organization and to repre­
sent them on the Evening Stoog- 
ent Council.
John J. Witherspoon Johnson 
has been a permanent fixture of 
the Carnegie Campus since the 
first day of April 1901. He has 
a string of activities keys that 
reach from the top of his head 
down to the top of lr°—well it 
goes to the tip anyhow. He has 
one end attached to a string of 
girls, the other?
John was born in, around, or 
about Pittsburgh, but he wasn’t 
reared, he just grew. He spent 
his childhood as lie did the rest
and unhappy wondering about 
where she is.
Lest we forget:
I got back my job when I re­
turned from War.
But who is going to make that 
guy give back my gal?

Every Friday night from 7:00 
P. M. ’till 10:00 P. M., eger 
krowds of bathers stand for .hours 
waiting their turn to get into the 
bath-sized pond located on the 
first floor of the Gymnasium 
Building. Every bather is allot­
ted fifteen minutes in which to 
delight hisself um swimming to 
and fro the hole length of the 
enormous 12 foot tub. Some fel- 
les even claim that they enjoy a 
good dive from the edge of the 
tub once in a while. Only trouble 
ever had on that score was the 
time Dave Pettigrew, expanding 
president of the engineers, decid­
ed that he too would attempt a 
dive into the water. Well, when 
he went out and let Bluebeard 
Miller take his turn in the water, 
Jim komplained there was ho 
water in the tub.
The adminestration guaren- 
tees that in the future there will 
be plenty of extra water lor re­
fill purposes, and has ordered 100 
watei buckets for the purpose.

of his days, that is just spent 
them. He attended Joe Butch’s 
Reformatory where he majored 
in cribbing, pick-pocketing, maul­
ing and lovin’. Being kicked out 
in 1901 he attended his first class 
here as a student in the college 
of the Fine Arts of Street Clean­
ing. John is still talcing the same 
subject as lie took in 1901. His 
girl Tish teaches the class and he 
must keep a zealous eye upon 
her.
John spends his daylight hours 
sitting upon a bench in the park 
listening to the pretty birds go 
tweet-tweet and watching the 
busy bees gather honey from the 
pretty red flowers. • John only 
watches the red flowers because 
red is his favorite color. He at­
tends class on Monday, Tuesday, 
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday in order to 
be with his girl friend.
John will never be drafted, he 
registered, volunteered in the 
army, navy, marines, C. C. C., 
A. A. A., T. V. A., W. P. A., S. E. 
C., N. R. A., D. P. W., but was 
refused by all because of his flat 
feet, bowled-legs, buclc-teeth 
(both of them), and crossed eyes.
