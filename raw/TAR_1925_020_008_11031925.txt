WORLD COURT 
CONFERENCE 
IS TO BE HELD
Carnegie, Pitt and P. C. W. 
Unite to Discuss World 
Court
REBECCA PONTIUS
HEADS COMMITTEE
Invitations Sent to Fourteen 
Nearby Colleges and 
Schools
A conference to be . known as the 
World Court Conference is to be hold 
in Pittsburgh, November 14 and 15, 
under the auspices of the Y. W. C. A. 
and the Y. M. C. A. of Carnegie and 
Pitt and the Y. W. C. A. of tho Penn­
sylvania College ror 'Women, and in 
connection with the Council of Christ­
ian Associations in New York City.
Definite plans for tho program have 
not. yet been made. On account of 
the passing interest shown by stud­
ents and faculty in tho conference, 
the committee is making an offort to 
secure a principal speaker of national 
importance, to bo announced later. 
He is to bo chosen especially for his 
interest in international relationship 
and in the World Court. Mr. Pitt Van 
Dusen, the treasurer of tho National 
Council of Christian Associations will 
be tho discussion leader aud there 
will also be small discussion groups.
The conference may bo hold in 
either the Soldior’s Memorial Hall or 
Carnegie Music Hall, unloss larger ac­
commodations are needed. If thia bo 
tho case, Syria Mosque appears as 
the logical alternative.
This conference promisos to be an 
Important ono toward getting the 
United Statos into tho World Court. 
Thoso organizations are anxious to 
have tho studonts think of matters of 
national and world importanco ratlior 
than confino thoinsolvos to campus af­
fairs, Nino conforoncos have already 
been held in differont parts of tho 
United S'tatos in tho last fow months, 
and many moro are plannod for Nov­
ember and Docombor.
Tho committoo in charge consists 
of representatives. from the partici­
pating organizations,—Robooca Ponti­
us, Carnegie Y. W. C. A., chairman,
E. C. Frazier, Carnegie Y. M. C. A., 
Helen Gilliland, Pitt Y. W. C. A., 
Aubrolc Wofford, Pitt. Y. M. C. A., and 
Martha Sheers, Pennsylvania Collogo 
for Women Y. W. C. A. An advisory 
board for tho conforonco consists of 
Dean Grocn of Carnoglo, Doan Amos 
of Pitt, and Doan Marks of P. C. W. 
PA-M Battriok, tho Y. W. socrotary at 
Pitt., and tho Y. M. socrotarlos, Mr. 
Davis of Carnoglo and Mr. Stranoy 
of Pitt, are also on tho committoo.
Invitations huv6 boon sent to four- 
toon collogos and normal schools In 
this vicinity to sond roprosontatlvos. 
These schools are Allegheny Collogo, 
Genova, Grove City, Westminster, 
Washington and Jofforson, Bothany, 
Waynesburg, Thiol, Slippery Rock 
Normal, Indiana Normal, Clarion 
¦Normal, Edilnboro Normal, California 
Normal, and Fairmont Slate Normal, 
W. Va.
Tho purpose oT this conforonco Is 
ossentlally to crystalllzo student opin­
ion In favfrr of tho World Court. Tho 
alms and principles of tho court will 
be discussed with a view of bringing 
out the good points of tho policy 
which President .Harding outlined 
shortly before his death and which 
he offered as a substitute for the 
League of Nations the Republican 
party had rejected.
The C. C. A. (Council of Christian 
Associations) realizing the need of 
international co-operation and cogniz­
ant of the distaste with which the 
American people view tho league, 
hope to do humanity a real good by 
getting United States into the World 
Court. The subject will shortly come 
before a hostile congress and it seems 
possible that by awaking the national 
consciousness of the students of this 
country and diverting a little of their 
interest toward international prob­
lems, not only will congress be moved 
but a few better citizens may be 
evolved.

Freshman Makes Remarkable Discovery
In Connection With the Study of Sex Question
, A discovery rivaling in importance 
the X-ray and the U-boat was recently 
announced by a Carnegie Plebe. “Sex 
G”, proclaimed as his very own by the 
aforesaid frosli in stating his cre­
dentials in the recent psychology quiz, 
will no doubt have a marked effect 
on our social world.
The title “Freshman Intelligence 
Test” is certainly a mismomer if the 
group of answers,—and questions— 
presented in connection with the 
statistical summary of the results of 
the tests, is to be taken as typical.
One Plebe, possibly initiated only 
the night before Into tho inebriations 
that his new freedom permitted, 
stated very definitely—in black and 
white—that the god Pan, was a horse. 
An extremely interesting debate could, 
no doubt, be arranged for the next 
assembly with the frosh who claims 
Pan for the fish family.
Other facts unearthed by the fresh­
man researchers follow.
"O, Captain, My Captain,” was pen-
. ned by Admiral Dewey—probably a bit 
of hand-shaking in his younger days. 
Plutarch was a great emperor. 
Dickens’ novels dealt with the wick­
edness of the Russians.
The Socialist Party generally ad­
vocates wage reduction,
Stevenson wrote “The Wreck of the 
; Hesperus.”
j Many of the girls rose to noble 
heights on the question, supply the 
.proper conclusion to tho following 
proportion; angels: heaven: men: — 
(1. Earth 2. Women 3. Boys Para­
dise) Four, “chorused the ladles, 
Professor Cleeton of the Department 
of Psychology issued the following 
statement concerning the more seri­
ous aspects of the tests in the col­
leges of engineering and industries.
A study of the intelligence examina­
tion scores of the members of the 
I freshman class for the school year
1925-1926 indicates the following facts: 
A—The average intelligence ex­
amination score for freshmen com-
pares favorably with the average oi 
scores earned by entering students in 
previous years and by first yeai' stu­
dents in other colleges and univer­
sities of high standards.
IJ.—There are fewer high |scoros 
than in previous years.
C.—There are fewer extremely low 
scores than In previous years.
D.—There are a greater number of 
Hcores Indicating average ability than 
In previous years,
Average scoro on all tests Ii0-30, 40- 
<19, 50-5!), 60-09, 70-79, 80-89, 90-99, 100 
or over,
Percent of Freshmen In othor 
schools In various classes 1, 3, 9, 22, 
26, 21, 13, 5.
Percent of C. I. T. Plebes 1925 In 
various classes 1, 2, 10, 23,. 32, 20, 10, 
2.
While there Is a great gap between 
the lowest and the highest scores 
earned, the freshman class tills year 
may be said to be more homogeneous 
than the classes of the past two years.

"JSant la Eu»t and West 1« West,

In. the both of them,” Is tho opinion of 
Colonel Frank P. Day, dean of fresh­
men, Colonel Duy «pent part of tho 
summer In tho north west cost regions 
of tho country, cites his experience»,
"My primary reason ror going 
west", states Colonel Day, "was to 
deliver throe lectures under tho aus­
pices of tho Unlvorslty of Oregon. 
The university Is having a drive for 
three hundred thousand dollars for a 
now lino arts building on their cam­
pus. I dollvorod my first lecture on 
'The Will'to Loam’ before the student 
body at a general assembly, Tho sub­
jects of tho othor two which were de­
livered in Portland were ‘What Edu­
cation Is tho Most Worth’ and 'The 
Function of Literature'. I also Bpoke 
at mootings of several of the civic 
bodies In the vlnclnlty, Including the 
Cumbers of Commorco of Portland 
and Eugene, the Civic League of Port­
land, and sevoral othors.
“During my stay I vlalted many of 
tho coast cities, and tho scenery arid 
tho Climate are both most enjoyable. 
Tho rivers, tho mountains, and tho 
guilders have a distinctive grandeur 
that is unrivaled by anything else In 
America. This splendid scenery is all 
only a few hours auto ride from tho 
cities, and the roads that load to them 
nro in fino condition.
"I mot several Carnoglo boys In 
that country and all of them seemed 
to bo making splendid progress in 
tholr different businesses. Tho people 
aro truoly fine, and they wero very 
kind to us. Most of them aro quite 
friendly and affable, and orten they 
would go out of tholr way to insure 
our comfort and convenience.
"Thoro is a groat similarity between 
tho oast and west coast cities of 
America. Portland Is the Boston of 
tho wost, and hor air of stolid com­
placency leads ono to believe that sho 
was founded even beforo Boston. 
Seattle Is the New York of that part 
of the country. Hor splendid harhor, 
and natural facilities mako it natural­
ly a great shipping center, so, conse­
quently it is a metropolis of tho first

staid Old English city transplanted in 
a now continent. It is Indeed Btrango 
how many now and different things 
that ono finds In soparato parts of 
America.
"Tho trip over and back proved to 
bo moat enjoyable. Wo made tho trip 
ovor tho’ southern route In going, and 
took tho boat from Seattle to Van­

In the last Issuo of tho Tartan, there 
appeared an article in regard to tho 
Carnegie "Loyalty Bond" campaign. 
This Is the first time that such a pro­
ject has ovor boon launched at Carne­
gie and we are hoping that our alumni 
will take notice and will give their 
whole-hearted co-operation. It Is to 
the alumni that the Alma Mater looks 
for her success, and Carnegie, not 
having the advantage of decades and 
perhaps centuries of graduating 
classes as some long established in­
stitutions have, must need make moro 
oxacllng demands of her alumni. Ono 
hundred dollars paid at the rate ot 
ten dollars a year, however, will not 
be a very great burden to any of us. 
Looking at the Issuo from a slightly 
different viewpoint; if every Carnegie 
man and woman would Invest less 
than a dollar each month In Loyalty 
Bonds, In twenty yoara, enough funds 
will have accrued to onable us to 
claim the eight million dollars prom­
ised by tho Carnegie Corporation.
R is very desirable, moreover to act 
now, and if at all possible to pay cash 
for our bonds, for, according to Mr. 
Porter’B letter, a dollar Invested be­
fore January first will amount to very 
nearly eight dollars by 1946.
Just think of receiving eight million 
dollars merely through having saved 
a dollar a month. Tho total amount, 
then, which will be at our disposal at 
| ho end of the twenty years will be 
twelve million dollars. And wliaT 
couldn't we do with twelve million 
dollars. With such financial backing, 
Carnegie would be able to have the 
most splendidly equipped shops and 
laboratories of any university; per­
haps we might even wish to build a 
cathedral of our own.
So, Alumni, we are counting on you.
36 PRIVATE DONORS’
AWARDS GIVEN OUT
FORGET, FOR AWHILE, THAT
YOU EVER WENT TO COLLEGE [_
Summary of a report made by National Industrial Conference Board:
Of the thousands of technical college students who were graduated in 
June, how many will shcceed in their chosen profession? Most of them, as 
Is the way with technical graduates, will have made some definite connection 
before graduation with some Industrial concern where they are to launch out 
on their career. But all of them, when the pleasant glow of commencement 
festivities has faded into the drab matter-of-factness of every-day life, face 
the problem of making their college training count; of proving that the time, 
effort and money spent on their education has been worth while.
A survey made by the National Industrial Conference Board of the status 
of technical college graduates In industry, reveals that opinions among exec­
utives as to the value of the young graduate in industry are not altogether 
favorable. Criticism, however, Is aimed at the attitude of the young grad­
uate, rather than at his ability or training. Too often he does not seem to 
lit in.
In many cases, the young technical graduate, in the view of the execu­
tives generally, Is too impatient for promotion to a position of responsibility, 
overrates the value of his education and underrates the importance of 
smaller details of practice; is frequently unwilling to work long shop hours 
or to work with Ills hands; has little or no understanding of the practical and 
business aspects of the enterprise in which he is employed, and does not 
know how to handle himself in the presence of or in contact with the 
common workmen so as to command their respect or co-operation. These 
critlcsms are made over and over by industrial executives to a point of being 
practically unanimous.
And what do the college men say who have not yet "arrived,” but have 
spent enough time in Industry to have acquired a fairly well balanced view 
point?
“Get the Idea out of your heads that college men are the only ones on 
earth who do things worth while. Work summers In the mills and take 
every opportunity to associate with all classes of workmen.”
This sounds the keynote of many of the communications from this class.
"Willingness to start at the bottom and to stick to it,” and “the ability 
to present matters clearly and forcefully before executives and workmen 
alike” is emphasized by another.
The degree of possible success for the majority of technical graduates 
will depend therefore to a very great extent upon their eventual mastery of 
general business practices and acumen and their ability to deal with men. 
This, in part a manner of personality, to a great degree, according to the 
thousands of answers to the Conference Board’s questionnaires, depends on 
tho willingness of the young graduate to start where all others must start in 
Industry, at the bottom; and to meet the workman not as a college graduate 
but as a man. Therefore, the joint greeting from the college men in industry 
to those stepping from lecture hall and college campus to the threshold of 
real life In Industry:
"Forget for awhile that you ever went to college.”

QUESTIONS FOR YOU

Will it detract from the value of our Carnegie training or degree if! 
Carnegie goes backward instead of forward?
Certainly! The better known Carnegie becomes for her high stand­
ards of training the more a "Carnegie Training’’ means to us.
Do we want the coming generations of students to have an equal or a 
better opportunity than we had at Carnegie?
It would be a simple matter to add fifteen or twenty dollars a year 
to the tuition and build up a reserve fund to protect the future genera­
tions of students, but we should be the older brothers and sisters to 
these students. Help them get their education as easily and cheaply as 
possible.
Is our education worth us what it actually cost or is costing the Carnegie 
endowment?
The average amount furnished each student registered in Carnegie 
for four years is $1,105.00, an average of over $275 a year. It is your 
problem to compute the amount your earning power has been increased 
by virtue of your Carnegie education.
Do you know what the tuition is at other colleges of similar rank?
Other college tuitions range from $300 to $500—M. I. T.’s is $300 
to $400; Harvard’s is $400; Dartmouth’s is $500, etc. Only last year the 
1925 class at Dartmouth voted to pay back, to their Alma Mater the 
difference between the actual cost and the tuition, in yearly install­
ments of not less than $10.00 a year. Other colleges are starting simi­
lar living endowment schemes.
Do you know that if Carnegie raises $4,000,000.00 in the next twenty 
years the Carnegie Corporation will give her $8,000,000.00 more?
The sooner we get started the less we will have to raise—read Mr. 
Porter’s letter in this issue.
Would you be willing to pay back twenty to twenty-five per cent of the 
difference (Column E) in yearly installments between what you paid 
and what your training actually cost the Carnegie endowment?
Think! We received $276 each year toward our education, or over 
$1,100 in four years. Each one of us must appreciate our duty and re­
turn a part of this amount in yearly installments.
Carnegie Loyalty Bonds are the answer. Ten dollars a year for a 
bond. Each alumnus with two to five bonds solves the problem of Car­
negie’s future and we can easily save twenty to fifty dollars a year for 
this cause. Start now and subscribe.
Remember we want everyone in. Get your classmates. It carries 
life membership in the Alumni Federation.
Students may subscribe for only one Loyalty Bond and pay off
the first two payments of $10.00 each while in school.

CONCERNING EUROPE’S DEBTS
The manufacturing interests of this 
country are at last recognizing, the 
dangers in the forcing of the Euro­
pean countries to pay the buge sums 
that they owe us. It is not so much 
the principal but the huge amounts 
that will be required as interest that 
will cause the troublo. In a. letter to 
the Chairman of the Foreign Rela­
tions Committee of the Senate, Sena­
tor William E. Borah, Charles Piez, 
President of the Illinois Manufactur­
ing Association, states their position. 
In ono paragraph, which sums up the 
attitude he says, "That we are assum­
ing in any settlement we do make 
with our debtors, it will be possible 
to transfer to us money or goods in 
the amount of the payments without 
utterly disrupting the trnde structure 
of tho world. On this point opinions 
differ, but we shall proceed on tho 
hypothesis tlmi It is possible to make 
nnymonts.”
The main idea sooms to bo that it 
Is going to bo dangorous to force tho 
European countries to p>.i.y tho huge 
«unis that wo aro demanding of them. 
Not, only is foreign competition going 
to hit. us hut It Is likely to destroy 
entire seettons of our Industrial ma­
chinery if we go ahead and force tho 
debt, of $20,000,000.

The most remarkable harp In exist­

the most ancient Instrument of the

Is, in all probability, the oldest harp

PLEBE GRIDDERS 
ROUT INDIANA 40-0
Carnegie Freshman Score at 
Will; Stauffer Stars Game
On a field that was a mixture of 
slush and mud, the Plebes added an­
other scalp to their warbelt by wal­
loping the Indiana Normal team 40-0 
in a very one-sided game at the Car­
negie bowl, last Saturday afternoon.
The game, although being a walk­
away. was featured with some spectac­
ular running by Iiarpster and Stauffer 
and some very good line plunging by 
Letzelter, aided a great deal by gap­
ping holes torn in the opponents de­
fense. The Plebes scored early when 
Harpstev skirted right end for a 30- 
yard run putting the ball on the four- 
yard line where Letzelter plunged it 
over. The Normal team held them 
for the rest of the quarter, but in the 
second period Harpster broke loose 
again for a long run scoring the sec­
ond touchdown. He was hurt in this 
play and was replaced by Crum. After 
this marker Limeric, Stauffer and 
Crum found holes for the remaining 
markers, scoring another touchdown 
in that period, two the next, and a 
touchdown ' and safety in the final 
quarter.
The Normal team waged a very 
game bottle, and in spite of the fact 
that it was greatly outclassed, never 
gave up trying to solve the smooth 
running attack of the Plebes. Lineup:

THE CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM
That the Plaid runners have suffered defeat at the hands of both Pitt 
and Alfred is not so startling as first thought might lead one to believe, when 
the relative inter-collegiate merits of tliees two victors are considered. Tho 
Pitt team is practically the same aggregation which won the college cham­
pionship last year, and Alfred boasts one of the strongest competitors for 
that title this season. This is not an excuse, but merely an explanation: for 
the Tartans have a better balanced squad tlmu that which ran for Carnegie 
last fall. In the remaining races, the scores should show a marked improve­
ment.

PLEBE FOOTBALL
The most surprising thing about the Plebe-Indiana Normal game last I *** 
Saturday was the way the visitors defended their goal on several occasions.
At one time the Freshmen were held for four downs inside the Indiana ten- 
yard line, after driving down the field with consistent gains. This in­
stances make football the game that it is today. The coming contest with 
Kiski is one of the hardest on the Plebe schedule, and finds the eutlre squad 
in condition for it.

SWIMMING
Last season’s swimming team was not exactly what could be called an 
unqualified success as a team. It did, however, uncover and develop some 
very good material, which in addition to other men of known ability, should 
insure Carnegie of a much better representation this year. This is an ex­
cellent opportunity to earn a letter, and ought to find many candidates out 
for the training sessions, which have already begun.

TO STARTLE PLAID
Tho Drexel game next Saturday will 
mark the entrance of Carnegie upon 
the homo stretch of the 1925 football 
season. This game will be the first 
to be played) on Forbes Field this 
season and should attract a good 
crowd, especially gince it is Pa-Ma 
Day, giving the parents a chance to 
see the Tartans in action.
Drexel should offer some strong op­
position if it has been defeated four 
ouit of the five flames played to date. 
Without exception the first four con­
tests were played with teams out of 
Drexel’s class. None of these scores 
were ovedwhelming and comparative 
scores are of little or no value in 
these days of upsets. Last Saturday 
Drexel found itself and. handed tho 
New York Aggies a neat lacing, 21 
to 0. This victory should put them 
on edge for the game next Saturday.

pany the team to Pittsburgh, and tho

William Donuhoe, former Edgowood 
High School star, has proven himself 
a big factor of tho Carnegie attack, as 
was clearly shown in tho Pitt game, 
two weeks ago. “Bill" is studying 
Machine Production in tho Industries 
School. As a basketball player, he Is 
considered oue of the best that ovor 
donned a Tartan uniform. He is a 
member of tho Delta Upsilon Frater­
nity. This is Bill's third year at Car­
negie.
Charles McClelland has been play­
ing a hangup game at half-back. 
Earlier in the season "Mac" q^rved as 
understudy to Captain Beerio for tho 
full-back position. McClelland hails 
from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Ho 
came to Carnegie last year, and 
played tackle on the Freshman squad. 
Since being developed Into a backfield 
man, his value as a lino bucker has 
helped Coach S'toffen considerably. 
"Mac" is registered in the Drama De­
partment or tho Arts 'School as an ir 
regular sophomore having ontered 
school at midyear. He is a member 
of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity.

In a preliminary to tho varsity

ALFRED DEFEATS 
CARNEGIE IN C. C.
Captain Peck Leads Visitors 
Around Snow-Covered 
Course; Score 20-35
The cross country team of Alfred 
College came to Pittsburgh last Thurs­
day afternoon and defeated the harri­
ers of tho Plaid 20-35, ovor the Schon­
loy Park course in more uniform time 
than any previous Carnoglo opponent. 
Tho complete track was covered with 
snow which made tho traveling hard, 
and the time slow. Difficulty was en­
countered throughout the race by the 
Tartans, as it was their first race over 
snow covered sod. Tho visitors, from 
their nortliland abode in New York 
state, felt quite at home however, and 
wore accustomed to a whitened course.
Peck, wearing the Plaid, crossed the 
tape first in 30:19, a very good time 
considering tho condition of the track. 
At 30:34, five Alfred runners crossed 
the tape together, this bit of strategy 
won the meet. Salkin finished second 
for Carnegie; Hobo, third; Himes, 
fourth; McNair, fifth; Ewing, sixth; 
and Lustanberger, seventh.
Many of tho Skibo runners were 
woll exhausted at the finish; due no 
doubt to the extreme cold, and the ter­
rific pace set by Pack, their captain.

PAGE FOURTHE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1925
&EDITORIAL PAGE
SUICIDE
With the coming oil tlii« school year ft new net 
of fniiehiity rushing rules -wore foisted upon the 
students. While still in the form of recommen­
dations, they are dictiims handed down by those 
arbiters whose decisions arc not questioned—the 
faculty.
Superficially these rules appear excellent in­
flicting at the worst, but a temporary embarrass­
ment upon the fraternities but ultimately; beneiit- 
ting everyone. Further »milysis, however, dis­
closes vicious possibilities, a cure which is seli- 
destructivo.
Just whftt conditions are the now rulcH to rem­
edy? They demand the immediate cessation of 
concentrated rushing on the plea that the result­
ing wasted effort is very detrimental to the 
Freshman, lie is duzzled by new experiences, 
new surroundings, new acquaintances,, and easts 
his lot as directed by an intelligence seduced by 
the sweet taste of pleasure and not by a proper 
foresight into the future.
In a semoster or in a year the Freshman will 
have gained experience, he will make a sensible 
choice and he will meet a congenial group in 
which he moves without friction. But there will 
probably be rushing extended over a semester or 
more.
Fraternities: will have a correspondingly longer 
time to consider their candidates and the choice 
ol' both parties will be a logical and a sensible 
one. Here’s the rub. For the big fraternities 
will get the big men, the mediocre fraternities 
will receive the mediocre men, the hopeless indi­
viduals remain as such. And in conscqucncc of 
the very democratic regulations in effect an aris­
tocracy will be developed.
Youth upon entering college is pliable and 
readily adapts itself to its surroundings. Many 
a student of shapeless individuality has been 
taken into a fraternity by chance and moulded 
into a marked personality. To him, the one-year 
ruling sounds the death knell.
Others, who bear a spark of hidden fire, are 
drafted into the ranks of a second rate fraternity 
and suddenly ilare out to carry their brothers 
higher than they ever should have ascended 
alone. Given a year, this man will be found out, 
and being himself ambitious, lie will make tho 
best fraternity.
Thus a distinct stratification will result in the 
student body. It will remain a democracy, but a 
bourgeois democracy which will recognize 
classes, not with money, but with activities as a 
criterion. The fraternity will no longer exist for 
the individual—a group of honorary fraternities, 
arranged in descending order, which house and 
board their members.
The objections offered above arc not impregna­
ble to criticism but are worthy of more than pass­
ing consideration. Intelligent discussion based 
on definite information alone can solve the fra­
ternity problem.
Ma and Pa Will Enjoy the Game
POLITICS
“We’ll bo delighted to co-operate in interna­
tional affairs,” tho United States concedes, “il! 
we may co-operate on our own terms.” This 
truly delightful demonstration ol! good will now 
finds expression in tho World Court movement.
The Republican stampedo ol' 1920 was largoly 
the consequence of anti-Leaguo fireworks and 
now as belated public opinion is slowly deifying 
Mr. Wilson, tho need of international understand­
ing again becomes n subject for political quib­
bling. Harding and Hughes, tho Bopublican 
bulwarks, instantly rejected the league. This, 
tho ponderous intelligence of a great nation pro­
claimed to be unAmerican and consequently uu- 
Blipportiiblo on the following points1:
J. It had not been drafted solely by the Sen­
ate or our ambassadors,
2, It inferred that we might be required to 
act as wo ought to and not as we should 
like to.
3. II would weaken tho efficacy of tho Monroe 
Doctrine and perhaps lessen our trade su­
periority in South America.
Since no loyal organization of boosters could 
countenance so gross an affront upon tho import­
ance of their nation, the terms of the League 
were modified and Harding proposed tho World 
Court as a possible solution of the world problem.
Harding died but his plan did not despite 
Henry Cabot Lodge and Senator Borah—who of­
fered their own panaceas with copyrights attach­
ed. The present Congress will have the pleasure 
of rejecting the World Court unless active pub­
lic opinion can be crystallized in favor of it. This 
unanimity of support the C. C. A. (representing 
the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A.) is striving to 
secure through the medium of discussion groups 
—the last remnant of £he good old revival.
The World Court plan is compatible with the 
highest ideals of citizenship of the following 
points:
1. It was sponsored by Mr. Harding, who was 
not only a Republican but probably also an emin­
ent Rotarian.
2. It permits us to suggest modes of conduct 
for other nations without ourselves accepting ad­
vice.
3. It’s a good thing.
It is not our purpose to discourage the World 
Court;. As an arm of tho League of Nations it is 
useful. But in itself it can wield no greater pow­
er in international relations than working the 
wrong problems can do in math. Why must the 
people of tho United States always bo so coddled 
that they cannot accept their responsibilities 
straight but must rather be fed pap to the patter 
of: “Of course, everybody has one now, Mr.
Smith, but we realize you want something dis­
tinctive. Wo only place our product before thoso 
with taste and discriminationV”
If we are to secure international amity, il! we 
expect our neighbors to trust us, must we not 
show them the same degree of confidence that we 
demand? But no. We fear that some other 
group may arrogate themselves to the dictator­
ship we have so often assumed. We stand pen­
sively alone and senimentalize about “entangling 
alliances.” We don’t want the League of Na­
tions but we will support the World Court.
And we will have discussion groups which no 
one will attend, and write letters which no sena­
tor will read, and an office seeking Congress will 
accept the World Court. And the Christian con­
science will remain appeased until it is time for 
another drive.

REDUCTIO AD TRAGEDIUM
I must tell you about my dear friend Jones. It might 
just as well have been Judkes, or Juggins, but for tho 
sake of assuring ourselves of the respectability of Ills 
progeny, I liavo chosen Jones. Jones Is. Intelligent, 
popular, and forty, and as far as the facts of moral 
conduct go, ho might easily bo you or I. But he Is a 
thoroughly modern young man, and so has adopted tho 
ovor popular and newly evolved creed of self develop­
ment. This cult of Now Thought, moro properly label­
ed Old Selllslmoss, has thousands of devotees. "Be 
largo, bo broad,” says tho dlciple of this outlook, “and 
you shall acquire a worth-while sense of values and 
morals."
Mr. Stophon Loacock dOBcribes a chap who is sin­
gularly like my friend Jones: "Ho rides a bicycle
evory day to train Ills musclos and to clear his brain. 
Ho looks at all tho sconory that ho BTTM-L- to do- 
volop his taste for sconory. Ho gives to tho poor to 
establish his sympathy with povorty. Ho roads his 
Biblo regularly In order to cultivato tho faculty of Bible 
reading, and visits tho picture galleries with painful 
assiduity to give himself a fooling for art. Ho passes 
through lll’o with a strained and haunted expression, 
waiting for clarity of Intellect, greatness of soul, and 
passion for art to doscond upon him like a lloclt of 
doves. When he dies It will be, presumably, In ordor 
to cultivate tho sense of bolng a corpse."
'Phis, then, Is the creed of the modern educated go- 
getter, Jones gives a shilling to the mendicant, not 
that tho man may be fed, but that ho may ally him* 
self with tho shilling givers. Ills whole philosophy of 
lli'n runs toward a cheap ego, In which blind passion 
for soir*glorlllcatlon causes him to use external condi­
tions and things as moro reactions upon his own per­
sonality.
Jonos drosses impeccably. His tailor Is Filth Avo- 
nue’s Boat*—not that that particular huckster of im­
ported woolens offers tho choicest of materials and 
workmanship, hat bocauso of tho hysterical and oxotlc 
fooling of solf-oxultutlon tho presence of tho omlnont 
craftsman's label on his clothes brings to him. Jonos 
goes to the best play and has no trouble In onjoying it 
thoroughly and discusHlng it among his ¡friends; for has 
ho not boon advised by Mr. Hornblow to bo suro to see 
that particular play, and has not "Vanity Fair" given 
him excellent and trustworthy material for his critique? 
Surely Jones Is an addition to any dinner party, for his 
conversations aro spiked with brilliance, charm, and 
versatality.
Early in llfo Jones discovered in his readings an in­
imitable epigram by a noted psychologist and scholar; 
it read something like this: Genius is ninety-eight per
cent perspiration and two per cent inspiration." Here 
was a pearl, a gem indeed. To think that good old 
H 2o and salt, and not a divinely given spark, were 
responsible for the great personalities who have ruled 
us materially and spiritually. Carlyle and his nine­
teenth century contemporaries were wrong; here was 
a remedy for all human ills. “Woe to you long beard­
ed philosophers, with your insistence that great men 
are born, not made—that a few outstanding intellectu­
als make history, when it is history that makes them."
Thus it came to pass that Jones began to interpret 
life with the psychologist and historian, in terms of 
definite scientific laws. Perhaps even Christ came in 
tho fullness of his time; ^yen he had to use the be­
loved John to malco way a path through tho wilderness. 
In time tho sooial scionces may breed Gods for us. 
What matters tho principles upon which our conduct 
is based? If only wo would fully devolop our- 
solvos.......................
Jonos 1ms llvod bountifully, as far as externals are 
concornod. Ho Is financially at ease; his' namo, as It 
appears la "Who's Who la America," Is deserving of 
eight closely printed lines, singing his praises. Ho 
"got, into the swim" by his own self olovation. Ho 
fools himself lo bo In tune with tho Groator Bolng, and 
by tho force of his complacent solC-sulllclonoy, he lcoeps 
to a refined morality. I ropoat, Jones has llvod abund­
antly.
Jones died, lie died very pleasantly and very neatly, 
for self-deification had been comforting indeed. And 
in a nationally known cemetery, on a costly tombstone, 
are inscribed the twenty words which make up his well- 
deserved epitaph:
Here lie I, J. Albert Jones,
Rest they easy, these fond bones;
Let none living slur my name,
For through myself I played the game.
—M. T. H.
PEREGRINATIONS
THAT SHILLING
- After much hesitation and many 
misgivings, I have dared, upon re- 
quet, to assume the role of a critic. 
The Fall issue of "The Shilling” is 
the iasy literary morsel at which I 
am expected to peck and carp. My 
only hope for future personal safety 
rests upon a sincere desire to camou­
flage the cavil with constructive com­
ments. Here let me pause for a mom­
ent, before plunging into the sea of 
literary criticism, to express admir­
ation for Charlotte Mansfield’s ex­
quisite cover design, the finishing 
color touches of which were added by 
hand.
I must confess that the efforts of 
the autumnal poets of “The Shilling" 
depressed me. The settings may have 
beon occasionally and spasmodically 
artistic, but the atmosphere was even 
moro gloomy than the October weath- 
or we have just experienced. Alice R. 
Moore began In subdued and dignified 
I ones with “Shadows"; Phillip Row­
land aggravated the encircling gloom 
by throwing his symbolic clouds over 
the moon; Halclcor confirmed the noc- 
tural tliemo, which had already be­
gun to savor strongly of Erebus, with 
"The Night". Tap finishing, cumula­
tive offoct—the last dismal yard that 
stood botwoon the fourth and a first 
dOAvn—was suppliod by Rowland, who 
wrapped about him “a volvot cloak of 
death", which servod as tho pootic 
oquivalont for a very foggy London 
fog.
T quote tho following from tho Ed I* 
torlnls: “A largo number of studonts, 
and this applies particularly to tho 
men, who are not pursuing any of tho 
various coursos in English, have de­
cided literary ability. Tho Shilling is 
oager to have such porsons submit 
their work for consideration."
Sam Well's "An Example of Poe- 
say" cortalnly confirms tho opinion 
and fulfills the wishes of the editors. 
"Much too much Rowland and a little 
too little Weil” may be a harsh and 
unfair criticism if there is a great 
famine in the Land of Contributors, 
but surely there is an Egyptian gran­
ary near at hand! Let me temper this 
criticism by saying that Phillip Row­
land’s "Fragment” is excellently con­
ceived, shows artistic restraint, and 
gives evidence of much polish. It de­
serves a page in any college maga­
zine.
Of the prose contributors, Sarah 
Elizabeth Hayes leaves no doubt in 
the reader's mind of her literary abil­
ity. If the critic's memory be not 
failing, Miss Hayes wrote with rare 
precision and distinction when she 
was fulfilling her “theme a week” re­
quirement as a freshman. When the 
editors say, “there must be a great 
deal of work doae in the class rooms 
that merits further publication," they 
know whereof they speak because 
they are speaking from experience.
I presume that the omission of Don­
ald Marve’s “Album Leaves—Words” 
from the Table of Contents was a 
mechanical oversight. The four word- 
slcetches, “A Hotel Lobby", “Monday 
Night Audionce”, “Across the Isle" 
(The spoiling is not mhie), and 
“Lunch" aro good oxamples of liter­
ary exercises; chromatic scales, anal­
ytical perception, “a round of strong 
words"—call them what you will. 
Just whether an andlonco would bo 
content to hoar Rachmaninoff practic­
ing arpoggios is a moot question, but 
there is no doubt In my mind lhat 
despite the analytical excellence of 
Maryo's "Album Loaves", thoy aro, 
nevertheless, exorcises. .If my classi­
fies Mon Is at. fault, then 1 should pre­
fer to find this particular contribu­
tion listed In tho Table of Contents 
of the next "Puppet.".
Of tho essays, I think that Margar­
et Baker's "A New Problem" deserves 
snecial mention and praise. The 
authoress <is sincere and outspoken: 
her style, pleasant and forceful: her 
nrgiiments. lucid and convincing. She 
discusses n timely problem with in­
telligence and insight, without pride 
and prejudice.
The Week 
in the 
World’s News
LESLIE P. BEEBE
"The Greeks sullenly and silently 
began their march out of Bulgarian 
territory at one o’clock this morning.” 
(News dispatch from Sofia on Octo­
ber 2fl.) What looked like the begin­
ning of a general Balkan conflict has 
been for the moment averted. Once 
again the League of Nations has come 
to the limelight and brought reason 
where the passions of the moment 
railed.
Trouble started near Demirliissar 
where both the Greek and the Bulga­
rian troops were concentrated. Either 
by lawless bands or regular troops 
the Greek soldiers were attacked. 
Greece political ambitions immediate­
ly flared up and they apparently hoped 
to duplicate the Corfu incident. An 
untimatum was delivered in which. 
Bulgaria was given 48 hours to deliver 
2,000,000 gold francs and to make 
proper apologies.
The wrong time was chosen to du­
plicate the nationalism of Italy for 
With/ the recent treaty at Locarno 
and the growing strength of the 
Leagjue the p'eaee wave is at its 
heighth. A special meeting of the 
League Council was called) for next 
Monday to be held in Paris and with 
that call came the message, sent to 
the two governments signed by Aris­
tide Briand, tlie President of the 
League, “I exhort the two govern- 
raenitss to give without delaying in­
structions that the troops of each 
government be immediately withdrawn 
:behind the respective frontiers and 
that no military operations be under­
taken during the examination by the 
Council." Both sides finally agreed 
troops were withdrawn, and ministers 
were appointed to confer with the 
League Council.
The problems and the differences 
are by no means solved with the stop­
page of hostilities but they are muieli 
more capable of being amicably and 
permanently solved in the Council 
¦Chambers than on the battlefields of 
the Balkans. This is the work that 
was visualed by Wilson and the other 
backers. But the irony in the entire 
Situation is that one of the leading 
nations of the world still laggs be­
hind, wrapped up in its own political 
concepts of world policies, still rear­
ranging its prejudices.
Politically instability in France is 
again causing trouble. The govern­
ment of M. Painleve has resigned for 
the purpose of getting out tho pres­
ent Minister of Finance, M. Callljaoiix. 
Tho question at issue is 'concerned 
with the capital levy, by which a levy 
of 10 per cent of the acquired wealth 
of the country is advocated. The So­
cialists who control the lower house 
are for it but. the upper house are 
all set against It. Painleve refused to 
glvo it his backing and would not in­
troduce tho bill.
Tho Finance Minister had not lived! 
up to Ills campaign promises and 
made a groat many enemies both po­
litical and personal. Yot tho ques­
tion still remains, how much better off 
is Franco going to be with Caillaux 
out. If tho capital levy is brought 
up it will bo voted-down in the 'Sen­
ate and if some other finance bill is 
brought up without tho capital levy, 
the bill will not get by the Chamber 
of Doputios. France has got to sub­
serve their political ideas and creeds 
to tho more material and economic 
demands of the country.

Dr. Ames Fully Informs Audience
Concerning Problems of Aviation
Elucidating for his "class-room” au­
dience of aeronautics enthusiasts a 
complete summary of the accomplish­
ments and problems in the field of 
aviation, Dr. Joseph Ames, chairman 
of the Executive Committee of the 
Government Advisory Committee for 
Aeronautics, last week presented in 
three lectures, an excellent basis for 
a thorough understanding of the avi­
ation problem so prominent in the up­
per stratum of current thought.
The unpretentiousness of Dr. Ames, 
which added the gripping touch of per­
sonality to his statement of vital 
facts, is well illustrated in this clip­
ping from his first lecture: “So when 
President Baker invited me to give a 
few lectures on the general subject of 
aviation, I accepted his invitation with 
pleasure, in the hope of being able to 
call attention to a few facts. I shall 
not venture far into disputed territory, 
nor shall I attempt to anticipate the 
findings and recommendations of the 
President’s Commission.
“In this my first lecture, on the 
Uses of Aviation, I shall describe 
types of aircraft and discuss their use­
fulness and their limitations, saying 
something also about outstanding 
questions of policy. Tomorrow, I 
shall describe the situation in this 
country and contrast it with that in 
certain other countries. In the third 
lecture, I shall speak about the scien­
tific knowledge upon which the whole 
subject of aviation rests.”
A non-teclmical but complete dis­
cussion of types of aircraft and the 
principles of physics on which the 
science of aerodynamics is based, fol­
lowed. This, and numerous succeed­
ing parts of the lectures, were illus­
trated with lantern slides. The speak­
er commented on the port of Pitts­
burgh district, as chief American 
source of duralumin, plays in the de­
velopment of the science.
“Apart from military uses both 
airplanes and airships may be, and 
have been, used to carry passengers, 
mail, express parcels, and even 
freight.” Comparing the records of 
airplanes and railroads in carrying 
mail, he showed that airplanes have 
had 73 per cent of “on time regulari­
ty” in winter and 98 per cent in sum­
mer as compared with 74 per cent and 
eighty-eiglit per cent for railroads.
“Airplanes have been of service in 
the patrol of forest preserves, discov­
ering 1,632 fires in one year.” Speak­
ing of the spraying of trees and crops, 
he pointed out that one company used 
a fleet of twenty airplanes last year 
for dusting cotton to eliminate the 
boll weevil, the planes dusting from 
200 to 1,000 acres per hour, thus sav­
ing thousands of dollars in the em­
ployment of laborers, horses and ma­
chinery.
The problems of aviation, and poli­
cies of the various nations were next 
touched upon.
“The essential requisites of air­
craft, regardless of their use, are en­
gine reliability, minimum fire risk, 
and structural strength.” The first is 
simply a question of engineering de­
velopment, and progress in this direc­
tion is-continuous. Risk of fire In air­
ships AN practically eliminated by tho 
use of helium, and the pending devel­
opment for practical use of fuel In­
jection engines, burning heavy oil, 
will entirely solve this problem.
“Before any real advance could be 
made in the design of the structure of
airplanes In straight flight, but also

At the tryq-out of the Girls’ Glee 
Club, October 22, 18 girls were ad­
mitted to membership. Mr. Charles 
Rebstock is directing both the Girls’ 
and Boys Glee clubs. Plans for con­
certs have been started. There is yet 
an opportunity for girls to try out at 
the meetings, held in Margaret Mor­
rison Assembly Hall on Thursday, at 
4:30.
At the meeting of the A. I. E. E. in 
room 50. Machinery Hall, Wednesday, 
November 4, at 7:30, representative 
of the Wagner Electric Company will 
speak on the “Fynn Weiclisol Motor,” 
a new development for correcting 
power-factor. A moving picture, “Tem- 
porature and Motor Endurance," will 
precede the smokes- and eats. Every­
body Is invited.
Tho Men’s Society of the ltodef 
Shalom Temple will inaugurate this 
season’s lecture course this week and 
extends an invitation to the faculty 
and students of Carnegie to attend. 
The opening lecture will be held on 
Sunday, November S, at 8:15 p. m., 
in the auditorium of the Temple. The 
speaker will be Professor S. H. Clark, 
of the University of Chicago, who will 
give a dramatic recital of "Jeremiah.”
aircraft, it was necessary to deter­
mine the distribution of stresses on 
the surfaces and controls of air- - 
craft.” With this knowledge alone 
can the planes be designed properly, 
so that the various members are 
strong enough, but not too heavy. The- 
remarkably ingenious methods for ob­
taining this information, not only for 
during such difficult maneuvers as 
the roll and the loop, certainly made 
interesting material.
“In the case of airplane wings, for 
instance> small holes are made in the 
surfaces, each hole connected by a- 
tube to a pressure recording instru­
ment in the cockpit.” These recorders - 
contain diaphragms, which may be ¦ 
bulged either way by the air from the 
tubes. On each diaphragm is a small 
mirror which, by reflecting a needle: 
point of light, makes a graphic record 
on a moving photographic film. A. 
large number of these instruments,, 
calibrated by previous use under 
known pressures, are set in motion 
simultaneously by mere pressure of a 
button by the pilot, and in connection 
with numerous other instruments for 
recording speed, elevation, etc., give 
exact stresses under definite condi­
tions, for every square foot of the ma­
chine. “With all this knowledge-‘
available, there is no excuse for the 
failure of the structure of an aircraft 
under any ordinary conditions of 
flight.
"But apart from the general re­
quirements of reliability, security 
from fire, and structural strength, 
commercial aircraft and military air­
planes have their special ones. The- 
former must be economical, they must 
be able to carry loads which can be 
quickly stored or unloaded, above ev­
erything else, they must be safe. The 
problem of cnottrol at low speeds is- 
receiving today the most careful and 
elaborate study; and a recent modifi­
cation of the wing devised in the- 
Naval Aircraft Factory, Philadelphia, 
seems to be most promising.”
On commercial aviation: “In speak­
ing of commercial aviation I have not 
yet referred to one very essential mat­
ter, the mileage which an air route1 
must have to be operated profitably.
It is clear that for large airships to 
be used to advantage the terminals 
should be at least 1,500 miles aprt, 
which would indicate that in a coun­
try as well provided with fast freight 
lines as is ours, it is doubtful if such 
craft will come into commercial use. 
For Great Britain, however, with her 
distant colonies and dependencies, the 
matter is quite different. Again, in 
this country, the commercial use of 
airplanes clearly demands night flying 
—the development of routes marked 
by light houses and beacons is an ab­
solute prerequisite. Our government 
has this matter very much on its 
mind, and the coming Congress will 
undoubtedly take action.
“It should be clearly understood 
that conditions in Europe are so dif­
ferent from those in this country Lhat 
it is impossible to draw definite^ con­
clusions with reference to our own 
problems. It is obvious that England ’ 
nnd France are exposed to an attack 
in force through the air before their 
military forces could be set in mo­
tion. They mu3t therefore develop a 
strategy, organize for defense, and dis­
tribute their budgets in accordance 
with this fact. We have our own 
problems and can be helped but little 
by a knowledge of what the countries 
in Europe are doing.”
The present status of the United 
States as leader in the work of devel­
oping aeronautics was very definitely 
maintained by Dr. Ames:
"Before going into details concern­
ing the progress of aviation in this 
country, I may remind you of the fact 
that private aviation began in this 
country. The names of Langley and 
the Wrights will always be famous in 
the history of civilization. Europe 
took up the development of aviation 
much more rapidly than this country, 
(however) and, under the pressure of 
war, made such gigantic strides that 
we were left far in the rear. But, hav­
ing appreciated some of the lessons of 
the Great War, the United States un­
dertook vigorously to advance avia­
tion, and at the present time we stand 
in the van, I think, of all the nations 
of the world. This being the case, 
many of the criticisms directed at our 
government are not deserved.” All 
the above is but a brief survey of the 
lecture series—merely the choice 
bits that purvey, as well as can be 
done on paper, the gist of the subject 
matter. The discussion of proposed 
changes in the present direction of 
military aviation in this country—a 
discussion too long for analysis in 
these colums, was especially weighty, 
and interesting in the light of the 
present controversy. Dr. Ames may 
feel that his visit to Pittsburgh was 
thoroughly appreciated by the inter­
ested few who seized this opportunity 
for enlightenment.
