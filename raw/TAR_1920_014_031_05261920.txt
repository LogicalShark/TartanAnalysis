SIXTEEN CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES!
Tech Track Squad Trims Cinder 
Men From W. Virginia Wesleyan
Take 12 First and 12 Second Places
Half Closely Contested
The Carnegie Tech track team by 
defeating the West Virginia Wesleyan 
cinder path men last Saturday after­
noon, to a score of 99-27 accounted 
for the sixteenth consecutive victory 
for the Plaid athletes this spring. 
Tech captured first and second places 
in all but two events, losing the top 
position only in the high jump and the 
hammer throw.
In the track events, all of which 
went to Tech, Kelly showed up excep­
tionally well in the dashes, winning 
the 100 and 220. He made the 100 
in 10 1-5, again equaling the school 
record and his performance last week 
against Geneva. Russell kept right 
behind him in each event, coming in 
second just behind Kelly. The 440 
was taken by Hiller in the fast time 
o: 53 seconds fiat, Captain Schmidt 
running second.
The distance runs • were won by 
Carett, Cooper and Greenlaw. The 
half was closely contested, Carett, 
Nichol and Code finishing in a bunch 
with only a few scant inches between 
them. This was the most interesting 
race of the afternoon, its close finish 
furnishing quite a bit of excitement. 
Mertz and Arnold traded first and 
second places in the 120 and 220 
hurdles, Mertz winning the high ones, 
but coming in second to Arnold in the 
1 ow hurdles.
Hammann did excellent work in the 
broad jump, leaping 21 feet 5% inches 
a id equaling the school record. He 
also took second place in the high 
jump, which went to Stewart of Wes­
leyan at 5 feet 8 inches. Stultz clear­
ed the bar at 10 feet 10 inches in the 
pole vault, which was mainly a con­
test between him and Woodwark, leav­
ing the Wesleyan man far below. 
Stultz is going great this spring and 
if furnished a little real competition 
in a meet would be lkely to break the 
school record of 11 feet 4 inches.
Tech won both weight events, moon 
taking the shot put and miller the 
hammer throw. The discus throw
went to Martz of Wesleyan at 104 
feet 2 inches, and Schlumpf of Tech 
close behind him.

POE, BY IDEN PAYNE 
AND THOMAS W. STEVENS 
PLAYEO BY DRAMA SCHOOL
The production of “Poe", by B. 
Iden Payne and Thomas Wood Stev­
ens, in the Little Theater, Division of 
the Arts last week, marks the most 
notable event in the School of Drama 
this year. The performances were 
finished and professional in every way 
iii spite of the fact that the play was 
being continually cut and revised dur­
ing the first few days it was played.
Perhaps the best notice that coulfi 
be given, is that written by Charles 
M. Bregg, Dramatic Editor of the 
Gazette Times, and a man of recog­
nized ability as a critic, who witness­
ed the first performance. It reads as 
follows:The performances last week in the 
theater of the School of Design at 
the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
of a play built around incidents, his­
torical and imaginary, in the life of 
the poet, Edgar Allan Poe, have 
drawn very large and interested audi­
ences to that institution. The play 
is the joint work of Thomas Wood 
Stevens, head of the school of drama, 
and B. Iden Payne, well known pro­
ducer and visiting teacher of the dra­
matic department of the school. The 
drama is particularly historic and con­
tains four acts, including events in 
the poet’s life during his residence at 
Fordham. The first act takes place 
at a gathering of distinguished liter­
ary men and women of the period in 
which are introduced most of the 
characters of the play. Rufus Gris­
wold, N; P. Willis, Margaret Fuller, 
William E. Burton, the comedian, and 
others who constituted the literary 
group of that day. The time covered 
by the incidents of the play includes 
Poe’s residence at Fordham, the death 
of his young wife and a created ro­
mance with a Mrs. Osman and its 
tragic termination, due to Poe’s sud­
den surrender to his fatal vice—intox- 
cation.
An Historical Character.
The drama is deeply interesting to 
those who may be students of the 
literary history of that time, and pre- 
;ents the unhappy author of “The 
Haven” in a guise thoroughly in ac­
cord with the general conception that 
History has created in the minds of

MUSICAL CLUB’S BANQUET 
ELECTION OF OFFICERS OF
On Tuesday evening, May 18, 1920, 
the Carnegie Mandolin and Glee Club 
held their annual banquet at the King 
Edward Apartments. All the fellows 
displayed the kind of “pep” upon 
which the most successful season the 
clubs have ever had, was built.
There was plenty of “eats” and 
when the word plenty is used it means 
enough, at least to the members of 
the clubs. The meal was a huge 
success, without a doubt, for after it 
was over the tables all looked as tho 
the wind had swept them clean.
After the banquet the clubs were 
favored with an address-by Mr. Frank 
Haaren, Graduate Manager of Activi­
ties at Tech on the old time musical 
clubs and their capers.
Mr. Robert Crawford furnished an 
elatborated description of one of the 
most amusing of the old timers’ trips

Tech Racqueters Add Four More 
Scalps to Their Large Display
Grove City, Penn State, W. Va.,
and Bethany Outclassed
Although Grove City College gave 
the Tech baseball men a fight, the 
Plaid netmen had the easiest walk­
away of the season when they met 
the Presbyterian racquet wielders, 
Saturday afternoon on the Tech 
courts, defeating them by a final count 
of 5-1. Only two varsity men of the 
Tech team were entered in the tour­
ney, Stockslager and Marshall play­
ing in the singles.
Copley, a varsity man of last year 
although he failed to make the first 
team this year made a very credit­
able showing. Schmertz, also a new 
man showed promise of developing in­
to one of Tech’s best netmen.
Simpson and Wade playing J. D. 
Marshall and Carr allowed the only 
victory for Grove City. Simpson and 
Wade are new material who under the 
careful coaching of Col. Brooks will 
probably figure in future Tech tennis 
teams. The summary:
Singles
Stockslager defeated Morledge 6-2, 
(5-0. Phil Marshall defeated J. D. Mar­
shall 6-3, 6-0. Copely defeated Rud- 
dick 6-2, 6-3. Schmertz defeated Carr 
6-3, 6-2.
Doubles
Harkness and Schmertz defeated 
Ruddick and Morledge 7-5, 6-2.
PENN STATE
The Tartan tennis team’s over­
whelming victory over the all-confi­
dent Penn State racqueters by a score 
of 5-1, proved to be the only mar for 
the Blue and White athletic meet, last 
Saturday at State College.
The Mt. Nittany boys had a feeling 
that Tech was as easy as the rest of 
their opponents, but after Beatty 
whipped Cohen, the State skipper, in 
the first set 6-2, they knuckled down 
and fought like real lions but the Plaid 
boys were unbreakable. So clever did 
the Lairds wield the racquets that 
only through the hardest scrapping 
did Gerhart, playing three sets, man­
age to win from Capt. Steve Stock­
slager, chalking up the lone victory 
for the State team.
All of the double matches were eas­
ily won by the Skibos, Beatty and 
Stockslager downing Boggs and Coh­
an and Marshall and Davis having a 
walk-away with Coursen and Gerhart. 
After the first set in his double match, 
Cohen jumped the net and sprained 
his ankle, Wilson, being allowed to 
substitute. The summaries:
Singles
Beatty and Cohen 6-2, 4-6 and 7-5. 
Stockslager and Gerhart 5-4, 1-6, 4-6. 
Davis and Coursen 6-2, 4-6 and 6-3. 
Marshall and Beggs 6-1 and 6-3.
Doubles
Beatty and Stockslager against 
Beggs, Cohen and Wilson, 6-3, 6-4. 
Marshall and Davis against Coursen 
and Gerhart 8-6, 6-1.
WEST VIRGINIA
Carnegie Tech tennis team coping 
with the West Virginia netmen for 
their second tourney of the season, on 
the Laird’s courts, afternoon of May 
21, administered another sound whip­
ping to the Mountaineers, winning by 
a final count of 5-1. The Plaid men, 
having had a walk-away in their first 
tournament were a little confident on 
entering their matches, but the Moun­
taineers were down for revenge, and 
played a hard, fighting game, keeping 
the Skibos on their toes all of the 
time.
The match between Capt. Stock­
slager and Phillips easily featured the 
meet. Phillips showed great improve­
ment, having lots of speed and a good 
serve. Stockslager could not make
his serve that afternoon and had to 
rely on placement, playing a defense 
game. The first set went to the West 
Virginia man 7-5, most of the games 
being deuce games. However, Stock­
slager got the other two set 6-2 and 
6-4.
Marshall and Hammon also played 
a match full of excitement and lucky 
breaks for the Tech men. In their 
first set after the games were 4-2 fav­
oring Hammon, Marshall won four 
consecutive games. Hammon started 
out with a three-game lead in th esec- 
ond set but Marshall came back and 
won five straight games.
Then Hammon got a game and 
Marshall clinched the match by win­
ning the next two. Beatty and Davis 
easily defeated their opponent in the 
single matches.
In the first double match between 
Beatty-Davis and Cutwright-Phillips 
the Tech men got away with the first 
set 6-4. For awhile, however, in the 
second set it seemed as if Davis and 
Beatty were outclassed, but they came 
back when the punch was needed, 
Davis playing a wonderful game and 
took the set 7-5.
McIntosh and Hammon playing 
Harkness and Schmertz in the seconds 
doubles match registered the lone 
marker for the mountaineers. Good 
teamwork and speed and the uncer­
tainty of Schmertz’s playing account­
ed for the victory. The summary:
Singles
Beatty, Tech defeated McIntosh 6-0, 
6-0; Stockslager, Tech, defeated Phil­
lips, 6-7, 6-2, 6-4; Davis, Tech, defeat­
ed Cutwright 6-4, 6-0; Marshall, Tech, 
defeated Hammon 6-4, 7-5.
Doubles
Beatty and Davis, Tech, defeated 
Cutwright and Phillips, 6-3, 7-5, and 
McIntosh and Hammon, West Vir­
ginia, defeated Harkness - Schmertz 
6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
BETHANY
Bethany College was a victim for 
the Plaid tennis crew, going down in 
defeat Monday afternoon, by a score 
of 5-1. Except for the game between 
Simpson and Ford the tourney was a 
one-sided affair Tech winning several 
love matches. This was Bethany’s 
first tournament and probably ac­
counts for the one-sidedness.
Lacock in his first set with Beatty 
showed fine form, but he caused the 
old-timers no trouble. Davis easily 
won from Meacham allowing him only 
five points in the first set and letting 
him oil* with one game in the second 
set. Copley, playing his first match 
of the season, displayed fine judgment 
and skill winning from Beamis in two 
loVe matches. Simpson, a Science 
plebe, lost the only match of the 
tournament to “Fliv” Ford, a South- 
hill lad. Simpson is a new man on 
the team and is inexperienced, though 
under the watchful eye of Col. Brooks 
will in all probability soon be one of 
Tech’s stellar tennis men.
Marshall and Davis won from Bem- 
is and Meachem in the first match of 
the doubles. Copley and Harkness 
were sent in to play the second match, 
Beatty and Davis having called it a 
day’s work, and easily beat Lacock 
and Ford. The summaries:
Singles
Beatty and Lacock, 6-4 and 6-0. 
Davis and Meachem, 6-0 and 6-1. Cop­
ley and Memis, 6-0 and 6-0. Simpson 
and Ford, 3-6 and 4-6.
Doubles
Marshall and Davis against Bemis 
and Meacham, 6-2 and 6-0. Copley 
and Harkness against Ford and La­
cock, 6-2 and 6-2.
Plaid Bests Pittsburgh Collegians 
in Last Half of Ninth Inning
“Little Joe” Doherty’s Accident
Means Great Loss to Team
Playing their hardest game of tho 
season, the Tartan diamond nine put 
a black eye on the Pittsburgh Col­
legian’s big prospects, last Thursday 
afternoon on Tech field, by overcom­
ing a one-run lead in the last half 
of the ninth with two 3-baggers and 
a neat squeeze play, winning by a 
final tally of 4-3. This ithe first de­
feat the Collegians have suffered at 
the hands of the Plaid warriors and 
again shows what a wonderful team is 
representing Carnegie Tech on the 
diamond this year.
The sad incident of the game hap­
pened in the sixth inning when a Col­
legian in stealing second base ran 
into Joe Doherty and little Joe came 
out of the mix-up with a fractured 
right arm which will keep him out of 
the game for the rest the the season. 
Honus is at a loss at present as to 
who will fill Joe’s place around the 
second sack.
Tech's first run came in the open­
ing frame when Ray Doherty got a 
free trip to first and scored on God- 
den’s high bounder thru short. In 
the next period Lynn singled and 
stole second and came in after Irwin 
had connected for a hot one thru 
short. Until the ninth inning the 
Plaid went scoreless and Brown, of 
the Collegians allowed only two hits.
In the fourth the Collegians man­
aged to get a run after Flannigan had 
singled and got to third on an error 
and came in on a sacrifice fly by Ruck. 
Ruck, in the sixth, singled thru sec­
ond and in attempting to stretch it 
into two bases ran into Joe Doherty 
and scored before Joe could recover 
or any of tho fielders could assist him.
In the ninth inning with a tie score 
White got to first on an error and 
later scored on another orror by Mill­
er, Tech’s new first sacker who had 
replaced Ray Doherty, who had taken 
his brother’s place at second.
Everyone was on their feet yelling 
for Tech, little Joe’s injury in tho 
sixth had aroused the ire of the Tech 
followers and they were calling for a

A meeting of The Tartan staff will be held Tuesday, June 1st, at 
j| 12:30 p. m. in the office, Room 162 Arts Buildings. The following 
g members are requested to be present, and failure of any one to appear 
g will be taken as signifying his desire to discontinue work on the staff:
J. K. W. Macalpine 
R. Shanno

The office will be open until 5:30 p. m. on this date, and any one 
who cannot attend the meeting should call sometime during the after­
noon.
Any one willing to work on the staff next year, but who has 
done nothing thus far on the paper should report at this time. No 
reorganization will be effected until next fall, but now is the time to 
put in your application for a position next year.
Two important meetings of the 
Board of Student Activities have been 
held this month. The Board has been 
particularly generous in its grants of 
money to the different organizations 
coming under its supervision; money 
was voted to assist the band and the 
musical clubs in having a banquet; 
two Margaret Morrison activities, the 
Athletic Association and the Y. W. 
each received $75; the 1921 Thistle 
Board was granted $50 for initial ex­
penses. A bill of $60 for special 
medical services to Tech students was 
also paid by this board.
Just now, the most important ques­
tion before the board and the students 
as well, is the relationship between 
the various publications about Tech to 
the Student Activities Board. Then, 
too, the installation of the Adver­
tising Bureau brings up another ques­
tion; just what remuneration shall the 
advertising bureau receive for the 
ads it gets for the publications?
Mr. Paquin and Mr. Sillers were 
elected to positions of editor and busi­
ness manager of next year’s Tartan. 
According to the present constitution 
of the Tartan that duty of election 
falls to the Student Activities Board, 
but the Board is not desirous of con­
tinuing this function. Our supervi­
sion of the activities is purely one of 
guidance and final decision, and in 
some cases, acting as banker for any 
deficits incurred. Action was taken 
that the Tartan staff should so revise 
the Tartan constitution and by-lav/s 
so that each staff shall elect its suc­
cessors, subject to approval of the 
Student Activities Board. An effort 
will be made also to incorporate such 
changes in the constitution as will 
make the positions on the Tartan 
more competitive and therefore more 
desirable to candidates.
A special committee will meet next 
Tuesday evening to draw up plans for 
future policy of Carnegie publications. 
There will be a representative from 
each Tech paper to present their 
views of the matter and three mem­
bers of the Student Activities Board. 
Some final arrangement is to h't reach­
ed then so that next year all non- 
athletic activities, the advertising bu­
reau and the Activities Board will 
work together in perfect cooperation.
victory. Johnson opened the last half 
of tho ninth with a triple thru third 
and Capt. Lynn followed suit scoring 
Johnson for the tying run. McCaw 
was on the batting slump and struck 
out, however, Irwin got Wagner’s 
signal for a squeeze play and laid a 
slow bunt along the third base line scoring Lynn for the winning run.

STRIKES GUSHER
Last Friday afternoon an interest­
ing bumper test was conducted on 
Woodhtwn Avenue.
A ten ton Liberty truck equipped 
with the latest type of bumper was 
borrowed from the R. O. T. C. and ihe 
tost was begun. First it was neces­
sary to get a sufficient velocity head, 
so that the impact would be sufficient 
to give a satisfactory reading. This 
was obtained by driving the truck at 
breakneck speed down the Woodhnvn 
grade. When sufficient velocity was 
obtained, a healthy-looking telegraph 
pole was picked out against which the 
truck was to impinge. Then with 
front wheels pointing toward the pole 
the motor was accelerated and soon the test was over.
Through a foresight there happened 
to be left in the way a tree and a 
hydrant. The tree offered no appre­
ciable resistance, but the hydrant 
completely absorbed the shock, and so 
altho the pole was not reached, due to 
the stalling of the motor, the desired 
results were obtained at the hydrant.
A full report of the test may be seen 
in the next issue of the Carnegie En­gineer.

THE RETIRING STAFF
Thia issue of The Tartan marks officially the initial effort of the new 
stall'. The men who have had charge of the paper during the past year have 
succeeded in making it a live, interesting periodical, although working to 
son e extent under the handicap of* new conditions of management and the 
inevitable instability of a reconstruction period.
In policy, The Tartan’s greatest effort has been to revive the old “Tech 
Spirit”, which used to be the talk of the surrounding country, hut which has 
sadly failed during the last three or four years. This aim seems to have been 
realized toward the latter part of the year, and while The Tartan does not 
wish to take the credit for anything it has not earned, we think that we have 
done our share. The Tartan did its best to support the important events 
of the year- -The 'Extravaganza, The Junior Prom, The Cornell Trip, The 
Frolic of the Vanities, The Home Concert, Campus Week, and was undoubt­
edly at least a factor in the success of those affairs.
The business side of the paper has been well managed, the circulation 
has been kept up to standard, and an all-round prosperous year has resulted.
The new stall’ leaders only hope that they may be able to make The 
Tartan an even more representative mouthpiece for student news and views, 
as well us a more efficient medium for better understanding between admin­
istration, faculty and student body than it has ever been heretofore.-----------0---------
THE ATHLETIC EDITOR SAYS—
Interest by the student body in the recent tennis mutches ia very much 
lacking, judging from the number of spectators that have been present at 
tho last few games. Tech's tennis team this year is without parallel in the 
school’s history and wo are willink to wager they could come clof$,to winning 
the collegiate championship °f Me East. |,(The present tennis team as yet has met no ronl opposition. They have 
six very decisive victories to their credit. The I'enn State tourney was 
perhaps the hardest thing that the Plaid netmen had to tackle buUlhey camp 
away with a fi-l victory. In tho last tournament with Grpve Ci|j[ College, 
Col. Brooks used only two varsity men and got away with a 5-1 'score.
Thin week two games are scheduled, one with Allegheny College and one 
with Syracuse. Allegheny will undoubtedly bo us easy us the past victims, 
»Syracuse, however, will test the mettle of the Tartan racquet wolldors, 
as they have been undefeated this season and hope to lay claim to the col­
legial.»' championship of the State of New York. They defeated W. & .1. lay! 
week 0-0, and W. A •). held West Virginia to a 3-2 score. Syracuse will pul 
up a hard game and the result will not be known until the last match is 
played. Syracuse will get 'licked tho, and then look out, University of Cali­
fornia.<i
AN OPINION
The following contribution was prompted by an article in last week's 
Tartan which seems to have stirred up some feeling on the subject of the 
policy of admitting students to Tech which is at present in vogue.
Expression of views and sentiments of Clio students, by the students has 
long been tho aim of tho Tartan- this seems to be the llrst time we have 
ever succeeded in “waking any one up”. Let us hoar what you think about, 
this matter, or any other that may be on your mind. Editor.
THE " SPIRIT” OF A CARNEGIE “ MAN".
In the May 19 issue of "The Tartan” there appeared an article written 
by “A Science Junior in good standing” criticizing the policy of the school 
with regard to entering classes at the Institute. “Bill” seems to find fault 
with the fact that the percentage of entering men who graduate is lower 
than in other schools. He does not attribute this to the fact that Tech’s 
standards are higher than usual, but rather takes the stand that the adminis­
tration is wrong in holding to this standard. For that is precisely what hi:' 
argument boils down to. No doubt he would pick out just the number of 
men he expects to graduate, coddle them, feed them their studies with a spoon 
and turn them out 100 per cent strong at the end of the four years.
Yet we wager that “Bill” would be one of the first to raise a howl be­
cause his diploma would be worth about one twentieth of its present value if 
such a policy were put into effect. Still he characterizes this as “The purely 
selfish policy of a young school”.
To quote further—“Hundreds of young men enter this school every year 
confident of their ability and sure of their plans”. We might put it “Hun­
dreds of young men enter this school every year, as conceited as Iiigh Schoo’ 
can make them and sure that they are far wiser than ordinary mortals”. YeJ 
“Bill” would take this bunch of green material and show a “Fine spirit o' 
approval”- Only a few graduate, it is true, but nine times out of ten the res' 
aren’t willing to work hard enough to graduate. There are some innistice' 
worked, no doubt. We have felt that a dozen times, but in most cases the 
man who was “canned” is waiting for the opportunity to come back and try 
it again next year. Does that look like HE felt the “injustice” of the system? 
We never worked for Mr, Carnegie, but we’ll bet our bottom dollar tha* h 
reserved his approval for the men who had the ability and the willingness 
deliver the goods. “Bill” failed to note that Mr. Carnegie’s most valuaM 
quality was the ability to SELECT men who could be depended on. M 
didn’t keep every one he hired; nor did he push the men who couldn’t, qualify 
and t he school is following the same policy of selection.
The older men will remember that Dean I eete used to make it a poi i 
to tell the Science I’lebes that Mr, Carnegie was not in the habit of throwin • 
good money after bad and that those who failed to live up to the standard 
would have short shift. And nobody ever kicked about it, either.
We’ll wager that “Bill” never amounted to much in activities or studio: 
if he feels that men are “Merely tolerated” at Tech. II»' also sprnl’ 1 of tlv 
“Select few” who are I»» be graduated. Somebody ought I»' stick a pi \ in hi 
conceit. “Bill” is not a Tech man, but a fairly good example <>•' how rotten 
a choice the administration sometimes makes in selectin'? its enterin'': class 
and is the best answer to his argument that men should not he dropped from school.—Another Science Junior in good standing.
m HEADS ASSUME 
CHARGE OF TARTAN
Paquin and Sillers Succeed 
Emerich and Allsworth
Ala special meeting of the Student 
Activities Board, held last Thursday 
evening, the editor-in-chief and buai­
neaa manager of The Tartan were 
elected for the ensuing year. Lawr­
ence Paquin, Arts ’22 was chosen as. 
editor-in-chief and I), A. Sillers, Sci­
ence '21, as business manager. These 
two men take charge with this issue 
arid the men they succeed will act on 
ly in an advisory capacity until the 
end of the present school term.
There ia no question as to the 
ability of the men chosen. Paquin in 
the oldest man on the staff at the 
present time. He had attained the po- 
aition of editor-in-chief before but was 
not able to serve on account of going 
into service. Sillers has worked stead 
ily all year and has shown great busi­
ness ability. There is no doubt of 
their success.
The remainder of the staff will re­
main the same for the present until 
their status is determined. Advance­
ments will probably be made with the 
first issue of next year. The election 
of the new staff is taken care of by 
the new editor-in-chief and business 
manager.
The men who are withdrawing have 
made every effort to make the weekly 
a source of interest and knowledge, 
The disadvantages of the ever-present 
reconstruction period were at times 
great but they were usually surmount­
ed notwithstanding. Better conditions 
and a better paper can be our outlook 
for next year.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
BY ACTIVITIES BOARD
Below is given a financial statement 
of the Board of Student Activities 
showing receipts and expenditures 
from October 1, 1919 to May 20, 1920.
Out of the General Fee paid by the 
students during 1919-20, the Institute 
appropriated $4,171.52 to the Board 
of Student Activities. This was the 
sum requested by the Board, and was 
based on a budget prepared in May, 
1919, by the student officers of the 
Board, as representing the amount 
needed to finance the deficit which al­
ways occurs between the income and 
outgo of certain activities.
It is to be noted tiiat the figures 
below may not cover the business of 
an activity for its entire season, but 
only the receipts and expenditures 
which occurred within the dates of 
this report, October 1, 1919 and May 
20, 11)20.

calculations were correct, for there

Two former J. R. Mechs were found 
in th'j plant, happy though working, 
doing for Mr. Mesta what they other­
wise would have done for Mr. Tek, 
with the exception that now they are 
getting paid for it.
G, I. T. TECHNICAL JOURNAL
AROUSING INTEREST
Tha staff of the C. I. T. Technical 
Journal ia pushing ahead with the or­
ganizing of the magazine. At a staff 
meeting last Friday sources of mate­
rial for publication and advertising 
were the subjects taken up. it was 
found that a number of valuable in­
vestigations had been carried out in 
the school in the last few years, by 
many of the faculty. Quite a number 
of these will be available for publica­
tion in the Journal, and, in fact, a 
lew of the faculty have been ap­
proached and have expressed their 
willingness to write papers. • The 
alumni are also being approached and 
many valuable articles will be contri­
buted by them. A number of the stu­
dents are also preparing papers on in­
teresting subjects, and many more of 
the undergraduates will be asked to 
write. Many of: the students are in­
tensely interested and are asking for 
something to do on the paper. Next 
week suggestions of what is wanted 
will be published in The Tartan, and 
it is believed there will be a hearty 
response. Students are wanted for 
contributions and solicitors of adver­
tising and subscriptions. Look for the 
article next week.
Th : staff is planning an extensive 
advei tising campaign among firms 
whose products will be of value to the 
readers of the Journal.
Ma ly of the largest firms in the 
country will be solicited, as well as 
Pittsburgh firms who deal in materials 
of technical value. It is the aim of 
the staff to make the advertising one 
of the selling points of the Journal.

FOR YOUNG MEN AND MEN WHO STAY YOUNG
Last Thursday afternoon the J. li. 
Mechs garbed in dandelions instead oi‘ 
fig leaves abandoned their.books and 
drawing instruments and journeyed to 
Hay’s Borough, Pa., to look over the 
Mesta Machine Works. The trip it­
self was uneventful except at the 
Brady Street Junction, where the 
gang w.as entertained by one of the 
mills’ mascots.
After arriving at the plant the 
grease wipers were divided into " roup:; 
of twelve and each group, headed by a 
guide, started its rubber-necking tour.
Great; interest was displayed when 
the men watched the hydraulic ham­
mers shape huge masses of glowing 
stool like putty, and the foundrynien 
pouring tons of molten metal as if it 
were their breakfast colfee.
Considerable time was spent, watch­
ing the giant gear cutters plowing 
their way through enormous gear 
wheels. The visitors probably felt 
that since they wore missing machine 
design their conscience would be 
cleared if they watched machine con­
struction.
The last spot visited was the tool 
room, where the men anxiously watch­
ed the completion of a gear, in the | 
hope of finding a half tooth left over, ‘
patterns are a feature of 
Society Brand Clothes. 
But the style, fit and fin­
ish in converting these fabrics have 
elevated Society Brand to its domi­
nant position. The most important factor is hand- 
tailoring. Unless carefully hand-stitched at cer­
tain points, garments will not hold their shape.

Now that Campus Week is over it 
is possible to make a review of the 
forces which created it. That the un­
dertaking did bring to the front a 
great deal of the latent spirit of the 
school cannot be questioned, and it 
must for that reason if no other be 
considered a success. Due credit how­
ever must be given to that body of 
real Tech men and women who work­
ed hard and faithfully and unselfishly 
to make the undertaking the success 
that it was.
The general idea of Campus Week 
originated with the Student Council 
and its Campus Week Committee but 
the program was too ambitious to be 
carried through by any one committee 
and so cooperation was asked of every 
organization and class in each of the 
schools. The response to this call, 
though perhaps somewhat hesitant at 
first, was such that there is no sec­
tion or department which did not con­
tribute something. There were of 
course some who were not interested 
or who were skeptical of the program 
or the way in which it was being car­
ried out, but fortunately these few 
were far outweighed by the greater 
I number who have that true spirit of
ELECTION BUG HITSINTER-DORMITORY COUNCIL 
ELECTED BY M.M. 0. GIRLS
loyalty which sets aside personal con­
siderations for the greater good of 
Tech, and it is to these that all honor 
and credit must be given.
The various sub-committees are all 
to be commended for the parts they 
contributed to the program—particu­
larly the Circus Committee, which 
started work with most discouraging 
prospects. Mr. Seabright’s work as 
Business Manager of the Circus and 
Concessions cannot be over-estimated. 
Repplier and Cunningham, in charge 
of the circus stunts, Townsend, work­
ing on the Sideshows, and Simmons, 
who had charge of the construction 
work were also on the job constantly, 
working like Trojans.
Mention should also be made of 
those who assisted Simmons in the 
more or less thankless work of con­
struction—the Building Construction 
Men, and those loyal Dormites who 
responded willingly to repeated calls, 
early and late, for help on the Circus; 
of all those who helped put on the 
stunts and make the costumes and 
properties for the various events; of 
those who worked long and hard turn­
ing out signs and posters by the score; 
of the contributors to the success of 
the Fraternity Sweepstakes and Qual­
ification Day; of the Military Depart­
ment and the School authorities for 
cooperation in the various details of 
equipment and arrangements; of Mr. 
Tilbrook and the Alumni Office for 
the way in which the Alumni part of 
the program was taken care of; and 
of those many others who contributed 
in various ways to the success of this 
first Campus Week. No doubt they 
will find far more satisfaction in a 
realization of having done something 
for their Alma Mater than from any 
word of commendation, however much 
that commendation is deserved.
That the Radio Club did not grasp 
its opportunity to make a grandstand 
play at the dance Friday night is to 
be regretted, as is also the failure of 
several other plans to materialize, but 
that big things for Tech can be ac­
complished when every Techite in 
school gets his shoulder to the wheel 
has been clearly demonstrated once 
again, and to all those who have help­
ed in this demonstration, the Campus 
Week Committee extends its sincerest 
thanks.
DUQUESNE-TECH GAME.
(Continued from page 1.) 
count of 7-2. Excellent pitching by 
“Skinny McCaw” who has won his 
fifth consecutive game and the bat­
ting fest with which the Plaid player 
opened the game accounted for the 
victory.
The opposing pitcher, Merecki, was 
at a loss during the first inning when 
Iionus’ proteges piled up five runs, 
but from then on he tightened and 
but two runs were added to the Tech 
score. Joe Doherty got his usual walk 
and went to second on his brother’s 
hit to short. Joe then steals third and 
scores on Durkin’s single thru short, 
Durkin taking second on the throw. 
Godden, then, singled to short left 
and scored Ray Doherty. Johnson laid 
down a safe bunt along the third base 
line advancing Godden to third. Thru 
an error by the second baseman Lynn 
got safe on first and Godden scored. 
Warrick laid down another bunt and 
Johnson, attempting to make home 
was also thrown out. Irwin flied to 
middle field but was safe on an er­
ror altho Lynn was thrown out at 
third. McCaw then hit thru short 
scoring Warrick for the fifth run in 
that inning.
Again in the seventh period after 
two men were down Warrick pulled 
for a walk and Irwin singled thru 
second, then McCaw who had already 
touched Ihe pill for a single and two 
doubles, connected for another double 
to middle field scoring Warrick and 
Irwin for Tech’s two other runs.
The Catholic boys went scoreless 
until the fifth frame when Keefe 
knocked a three-bagger and scored on 
a’i error by Irwin. Duquesne’s other 
run camp in the seventh when Erlain 
lifted one over the fence for a homer. 
McCaw besides pitching a wonderful 
game got a single and three doubles 
in his four times at the bat. The

THE DAVIS.
An extraordinary dual attraction is 
announced for the week beginning 
Monday afternoon, May 31, Memorial 
Lay, in the Davis Theatre. Two no­
table stars are to headline the pro­
gram of Keith vaudeville. Kitty Gor­
don, the statuesque beauty of muci- 
cal comedy fame, will top the bill with 
Jack Wilson, the blackface buffon, as 
second feature. Miss Gordon, who 
has starred in a score of musical 
cvomedy and moving picturc produc­
tions is one of the notable women of 
the stage in the present day. She is 
connected by marriage ties with the 
titled Beresford family of England. 
She will present an unique entertain­
ment in which songs and humorous 
comment will be featured, and besides, 
Miss Gordon, as is her won’t, wil show 
a lot of sartorial novelties.
Another special attraction in the 
coming week will be George Mac- 
Farlane, the popular baritone, who 
starred in “The Heart of the Heather” 
the revival of “Robin Hood”, and for 
a long time was featured in “Miss 
Springtime”. He will introduce new 
songs and a bit of monology.
James McCormack and Eleanor 
Irving will present Ben Ryan’s skit, 
called “Telling the Truth”. It is a 
comedy with songs and dancing inter­
larded. Several other important at­
tractions and a group of news mo­
tion pictures will add to the pleasure 
of an afternoon or evening at the 
Davis Theatre in the forthcoming 
week.---------a----------THE GRAND.
Mark Twain’s famous story “Huck­
leberry Finn”, the masterpiece of all 
his lovable and human works of fic­
tion, has been put into an all-star 
special production by the Paramount- 
Artcraft Company, and will head the 
program at Pittsburgh’s New Million- 
Dollar Grand all next week, starting 
Monday morning, May 31.
“Huckleberry Finn” has long been 
the world’s greatest romance of youth. 
Read with joy by countless millions, 
translated into every civilized tonguet 
breathing life and fun and sorrow and 
adventure. It has been transposed to 
the screen with an amazing faithful­
ness to the original text. The sub­
titles have been taken direct from the 
book, and every incident of plot or 
action as revcoled in the written deeds 
of Muck and his pal, Tom Saw yer. 
The picture is one to arouse fond 
memories and bring new pleasure to 
those who have revelled the Mark 
Twain’s work, and to prove keen film 
entertainment for those not already 
familiar with the story.
Completing the bill will be a fox 
Sunshine comedy, “The Great Nickel 
Robery”; the Grand News Weekly 
and the “Topics of the Day.” The 
symphony orchestra, directed by Dav­
id J3roudy, will play “Southern Rhap­
sody” by Lucius Hosmer, as a special 
number, approprite both to the fea­
ture film and the Memorial Day ob­
servance. Both orchestra and pipe 
organ will be all-day features. Per­
formances will be continuous from 
10 a. m. till 11 p. m.

MERICA is fast becoming a pipe smoking country. Every 
- year more and more men are realizing the comfort, the satis­
faction, and the economy of the pipe. And by natural selection, 
more and more men are smoking W D C Pipes. This is not 
chance. It is because W D C Pipes offer the utmost in pipe value. 
Honest French briar, seasoned by our own special process make 
W D C Pipes break in sweet and mellow. Coupled with that is a 
self-governed body of pipe makers whose sole object is to fashion 
pipes which are without peers in all the world. And it has been 
accomplished. Ask any good dealer.
