THETARTAN
WHITE FRIARS.
Have you ever seen the first dress rehearsal 
for a college play? If you haven't you have 
missed half your life. The White Friars who 
are producing our play “All in a Dormitory 
had their first dress rehearsal one day last 
week in preparation for the play at the Alvin 
on the evening of J11112 1.6th. The costumes 
having arrived from the Philadelphia concern 
which supplies the Mask and Wig Club, the 
boys prepared to don their new attire. Of 
course the male portion had no difficulty in 
getting into their garb.
But the female chorus! Such a bunch of 
giddy girls as those boys became! Of course 
they had a little difficulty in squeezing their 
thirty-six inch waists into a twenty-four inch 
girdle. They found it advisable to call in 
some of our husky athletes, who after advis­
ing their victims to expel all their wind would 
pull on the girdle, until red in the face, they 
succeeded in snapping the clasp. The chorus 
raved over the cute pink silk stockings and the 
high heeled pumps—until they tried them on— 
then they said other things.
They were told to look natural and indeed
they did their best, even going so far as to
fill their mouths with hat pins as they adjusted 
their “Merry Widows” before the mirrors.
To Mrs. Chatterly who always kept in mind 
that she was a “washer lady of family,” 
the binding of skirts above her dainty ankles 
was a matter of little or 110 concern. She held 
her head high and arms a-kim-bo as she lead 
off in the dance. Heinrich Hjohenblitz in his 
great German dance forgot his terror of the 
Phantom dog and displayed to their best ad­
vantage his much becheckered coat-tails.
Our own orchestra furnishes all the music. 
This adds to the interest of the play. Mr.
Fred Potter, who is well known in musical
circles, has been secured as a leader. There 
are many bright, snappy, catchy songs through­
out the play. Such songs as “Poker,” “Just 
Out of College,” “Rah, Rah Boys Pee-rade” 
should recall to every university man, the joys 
of his college life. But, whether college-bred 
or not, the play is for everybody and I’m sure 
that all can enjo^ “A Made-to-order Maid,”
“Walter—Old Dog,” “Who is Who,” “Bliss­
ful Kiss,” “Honk, Honk” and “In High So­
ciety."
The chorus,under Mr. Edmunson’s direction, 
has, by daily practice, mastered the intricate 
steps of a great variety of difficult dances, and 
has succeeded in winning their coaches’ full 
commendation.
A unique feature of the performance will 
he the dainty souvenir programs. A strip of 
Tartan plaid across one corner, and tied with 
silk ribbons in the colors of the four schools 
makes a distinctly l ech program. It contains 
besides the program, pictures of the Club and 
many of the scenes. Handsome posters in red 
and black have been distributed throughout the 
city, for the purpose of advertisement.
The Seniors are prepared to turn out in 
a body and are willing to take gracefully any 
fun which may be poked at them in the play. 
The faculty also will come in for its share. 
Being a college play it is especially fitted for 
student production, and because it is a truly 
all-school play, it promises to be as success­
ful as it is unique.
“All In a Dormitory” will be given as a 
complimentary benefit for the Sewickley 
Valley Hospital Association in the Auditorium, 
Sewickley, Saturday, June 13th, preliminary to 
the Pittsburgh performance. Many women, 
prominent in Sewickley society, have signified 
their intention of serving as patronesses for the 
affair, and assure the White Friars that their 
appearance in Sewickley will be a brilliant and 
successful one.

I take it from the substance of the previous 
article, that the writer must be connected with 
a department which is not receiving its full 
share of students. This may be due to a num­
ber of causes too numerous to mention here. It 
is not the intention of the writer of the present 
article in again bringing to the attention of the 
under classmen the problem of choosing their 
life's work; the advantages or disadvantages 
of any one department, but rather to advise the 
writer of your previous article, that it is results 
that count; and if after a few years of battle 
with the practical side of their profession, the 
graduates of the departments to which he 
alludes do not compare favorably with those 
of the other departments and other colleges, 
then the time is ripe for him to step in and 
correct the fault by convincing the Plebes of 
the folly of their choice.

MHO CLUB MEETING.
The regular meeting of the Mho Club 
on last Friday evening took the form of a 
reception to the Plebes who have elected the 
Electrical Engineering .course. As stated in 
President Patterson’s brief address of wel­
come, the object of the meeting was to get 
acquainted with the F-ebes who would be in 
the Electrical Department next year. Mr. 
Work followed with a short talk on the social 
side of the club and McIntyre responded on 
behalf of the Plebes. The speech making 
closed w>th a talk on athletics by M. B. 
Gibson.
The musical end of the program was ably 
upheld by Oetting and Linderman. An ap­
petizing lunch was served and the guests de­
parted after joining in “Amici.” The success 
of the meeting was due largely to Best, who 
was chairman of the entertainment committee.

BEE-U-TI-FUL.
If you should hear such an exclamation some 
dark night as you wend your weary way home­
ward, you might as well abandon your search 
for the loving couple. It would suggest before 
you begin, as it is only Happy Hower with one 
foot on the dash board of an express wagon, 
the other on one of “Sniders pride” tables while 
with his hands he-steadies a photometer, all 
the while intent on his fell design to lower the 
profit of some poor abused lamp manufacturer 
to a paltry 15 or 20%. For does he not nightly 
sally forth with his colleague, the Theolog, as 
moral support to gaze long and earnestly at 
some of the left overs from the last campaign 
torches that are called street lights, and after 
gazing does he not place a 15 where a 30 
belongs according to specifications? Although 
new to engineering work when he came to
* Tech Happy took to it as naturally as the small 
boy does to dirt or the “Poor Indian”, to pain 
killer in a prohibition state. The factor of 
safety, or of ignorance, as some prefer to call it, 
early appealed to him and he perceived what a 
great advantage it would be to have one factor 
for all occasions. So we see him adopting for
suit.
his factor the second digit and thus it is that 
the 60 candle power light suffers an eclipse to 
30 under his hands while the student who ob­
tains 40 where lie had confidently expected 80 
looks, but not in vain, for the reason for his 
flunk. It is almost worth a flunk to have him 
explain by the ladder analogy (not water) why 
he was forced, no matter how painful the task, 
to slip one over on you. The said ladder 
analogy being that a ladder two feet too short, 
110 matter on how good principles it was con­
structed, would not answer its purpose.
Mr. Hower’s popularity is at its maximum 
when he expatiates on the mag-nif-i-cent spec­
trum of the sodium flame or the perfectly de­
lightful process of measuring the wave length 
of the light given off by. the fire-fly, but it 
suffers a rude shock and rapidly approaches 
minus infinity as an asymtote when his inati- 
able demand for facts brings to light his Grad- 
grind characteristics that are so admirably con­
cealed at all but examination time.
Foul rumor has it that he deserted his guns 
last Saturday when he left the battlefield 
where his alma mater was being trimmed a la 
“Merry Widow,” but we are able to assure oui 
anxious friends that such was not the case. It 
was due to the demands of the fair sex to 
whom he is unable to turn a deaf ear no matter 
how enticed by the base ball fan that he was 
compelled to curtail the students’ opportunity 
to guy unrestrained.

markable ball, Barrett of Case having 11 
strikeouts, and Burnside keeping his hits well 
scattered. The feature was the work of Tech’s 
infield, which had four double plays, Kirk, 
Burgham and McKinley figuring in three of 
them. Tech hit the ball very hard, having 
four three-baggers and one home run. Capt. 
Coldren played a good game both at bat and 
in the field, having two three-base hits and the 
home run to his credit.

---------------------------------------------------

10THE TARTAN
Tech opened up on Barrett in the first inning. 
After Barclay had been put out, Burgham got 
to first on an error by Figgie, lie stole second 
and came home on Coldren’s hit. In the fourth 
inning Coldren led off with a three-bagger, 
scoring on McKinley’s three-bagger. Tech 
scored three runs in the fifth. After Harrison 
flew out to Figgie, Burnside hit over the infield 
and scored on Barclay’s three-bagger. After 
Burgham had gone-out, Coldren followed with 
a home run. This ended Tech’s scoring.
Case did not give Tech any trouble until 
the ninth, when it scored two runs. Hawley 
hit, Regan knocked the ball to Harrison who 
muffed, Hawley advancing to second. On 
Muggleton’s out both runners were advanced. 
On Barclay’s low throw past Coldren, Hawley 
scored. Regan scored on Benz’s hit. The 
game was played to a fair-sized crowd and 
was umpired by Shaw of Pittsburgh.

THE TARTAN11
ADVICE TO MECHANICAL ENGINEER­
ING STUDENTS ABOUT TO LEAVE 
THE FINSBURY TECHNICAL COL­LEGE.
(Continued from last week.)
Each of you reduces his own observations in 
the way already described to you. He finds 
his indicated horse-power, the feed-water per 
hour per indicated horse-power, the water per 
hour shown by his diagrams per indicated 
horse-power, and so on; and when we have 
gathered all our observations into a great 
table, and each of you has seen with certainty 
how the total energy of the coal is distributed 
—so much up the chimney, in the steam 
jacket, in condensation in the cylinder, to the 
condenser, in friction in the engine, etc., etc. 
—he has obtained a practical knowledge of the 
'steam engine which no amount of reading or 
listening to lectures could possibly supply.
I need not apologize o you for showing you 
how you are equipped. I want to impress 
upon you the value of the training you have 
had. Like other men, you can make calcula- 
ions from formulae; but just think of the re­
sults of the experiments made by you on fric­
tion at different speeds, and notice the light 
which they throw upon the insufficiency of 
the formulae which you must employ in mak­
ing calculations. They not only do this, but 
they give you courage to make calculations, 
for you know now the extent of your ignor­
ance and knowledge.
Some of you will, I think, become eminent 
in the mathematics of engineering. I am sorry 
to say that many of you will fail to pass our 
examinations, and will not obtain the college 
c rtificate. Xow that you are about to leave 
us, I may tell you that this certificate business 
does not matter so very much after all. You 
have all done your best, I think, and I have 
nearly as much sympathy with those who fail
• in examinations as with those who pass. I 
have had a large experience of men, and know 
that the race is not always to the apparently 
swrift. There is a crucial question to be asked 
you. Do you like mechanical engineering in 
any of its aspects? Do you love to fiddle with 
mechanical things. Have you been put into 
this line by your parents, or do you like it for 
itself? Would you prefer going into the 
church, or into a bank, or have you a hanker­
ing after law or doctoring? If so, now is the 
time to act upon that instinct; it is not too 
late; your education will not be wasted. How­
ever high up you may have been in an ex­
amination list, give the thing up! If, however, 
you like mechanical engineering, stick to it, 
notwithstanding any failure to pass an ex­
amination. Far be it from me to disparage

those wrho pass examinations well—you know 
that I honor them highly—but they will yet 
find out that some of their contemporaries 
whom they look upon as “duffers” will be 
magically successful as engineers if they love 
their profession, and bring to it the common 
sense in which few Englishmen are deficient.
Hitherto you have been learning how to 
learn your rade. You have been learning the 
principles underlying a trade, but not the 
trade itself. You have, it is true, acquired a 
considerable amount of skill. Some of you can 
chip and file and scrape as well as any fitter in 
the country. Some of you can set a bit of 
work in the shaping machine as skilfully as 
any man. But all this training has been given 
you that you may learn o be a good work­
man in three years instead of seven.
