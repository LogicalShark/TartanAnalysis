His honor, old Squire Pipe is unques­
tionably tjie world's ablest judge of pipe 
tobaccos. Who else is by nature* training 
and experience so weli-qualified to try a 
tobacco and hand down a decision on 
it?. . So, iij the case of Granger Rough 
Cut, the plea is that Judge Pipe's verdict 
be accepted as final! x
To make a long brief brief: Character 
witnesses everywhere have sworn to 
Granger's , sterling qiiality. Experts have 
vouched for the superiority of its rough 
cut.; Chemists, have testified that the new 
“glassine^sealed" foil'jpouch keeps the 
tobacco in perfect condition.
• Finally, -it has been shown that by 
' using this fôil'pôuch (instead; of a costly 
tin) it is possible to sell Granger at just 
ten cents. On these arguments 'Granger ' 
rests its case! A couple of pipefuls will 
cpnvin^S^uire Pipe that it is the world's 
greatest pipe tobacco... and any gobd 
judge of tobaccos will confirm the decision!

OÆNEGŒTEOH
Every so. often in the school.year one cannot 
help remarking that thmgs àre rather perfunc­
tory and mediocre—yes, even icrnde. Student 
. life, is.rlsdamned inevitable around’ here;.we 
have fallen into the rut of passive acceptance 
of our status quo .without so much-as à quiver 
of.;reaction/ In .short; we are: grooved into s 
campiis1 existence' which is traditional, ' which 
¦ at best can be. nothing more'than routine and 
red tape.. And thèse facts are not to be easily 
disputed nor «disproved........
To witness : the status of scholarship at Car- 
[ negie. Scholarship is interpreted in terms of 
marks; the instances are,few wherein there ìb 
to found the impulse'ond the informing spirit 
of disinterested inquiry, of study which. hà9 
no utilitarian motive — the amateur spirit, 
study f ór. its own.sake. Learning as an end 
in itself is an unheard of quality on this cam­
pus.' Of• course there are exceptions, but in 
this instance as always, they merely prove the 
rule and reinforce the argument.
\Apain, and less academic, our traditions. 
Traditions range very widely in kind! It is 
traditional for the plebes and, sophomores to 
meet early .in the year, and to.bury the hatchet. 
Later on in the year it is traditional to hold 
^ plebe-sophomore fights. Sometimap it is -tra­
ditional to attend a danceV other times to plant 
a tree. Just as traditional, it would seem, .to 
get muddy feet while walking across the cut, 
or for .the plébea to chew tobacco at a trial.
- All these traditions arc .artificial traditions, 
entailing forced acceptance on the part of the 
participators. The traditional view of tradi­
tions is not to be found on this campus, where-- 
iâ a tradition is a mere gestar«, an unconscious 
part of one’s life; not a deliberately,built, up 
.activity, but an expression which lias long 
since ceased to be apprized. To establish a 
tradition at Carnegie, a group of sponsors as­
semble and decide what the tradition shall be.. 
The following 'week the school paper .auspic­
iously announces—IT IS CONSIDERED TRA­
DITIONAL TO ATTEND TO DIAMOND JU­
BILEE, or whatever the event to be establish- - 
ed is. And more like this.
a perfunctory student body homeopathic doso;> 
of Truth, an endless red tape in student or­
ganization, a crude crowding and pushing in 
public places, tearing up property, every one 
you m^t lacking that ever to be desired “eter­
nal senso of the fitness of things.”'
All this.worries and disturbs tbe idealist, 
who is apt to see Carnegie through the mi 
of his own polite phrases—“a bigger and bet­
ter Carnegie," and “a different type of man 
being attraeteti here every year.” Herein is 
.the!’idealist.affected .by myopia.- He. forgets 
that .Cemegie can never be different unless tho 
..whole schémé-of things change.. He thinks of 
his school in terms of a great university, when 
it is merely a-technical institution.. A profes­sional schools “A’school of., practical guid­
ance,” would, b'c a good term:'1'The place' 
whereip metKbd is the mechanism, with goal 
of the professional point of view always^ in the 
foreground. The object of a technical institu-: 
tion such as Carnegie is to prepare, men and 
women for the practice of a particular busi­
ness. ^And this is a. point that ' the idealist is 
apt to' overlook.
• There is no use looking for a fecundity 
which can néver be found. The objects here 
arc definite, thorough and utilitarian. _ The/.air 
of the shop, office,'studio and theateV^pei^tìe 
the atmosphere of our buildings. Indeed, if 
theology.were,a eubjéct in our curricula, there 
would boatbuilding especially fitted but in pasr 
tors' studies.' ¦ It- would be inevitable. For stu­
dents are.sent here to have theiT feet solidly 
sei} in exact knowledge j thcy must master 
methods—skill and practice, readiness and pre­
cision in a score of mechanical processes. They 
are intent on Businlss, when they are intent 
at all. There Ì6 no time for close association 
with pure science, with the studies of. the Uni­
versity which are the foundation of all liberal­
izing forces. Rather must.practicé'.be always 
be kept in mind; things must be taught which 
will,be serviceable. ,
I say there is no time for the liberalizing ,acr; 
tivity of the university. And until this bridge 
is gaped, it is useless for drastic ironings out 
of the rough places to.be attempted.. .If .the 
courses were two to three years longer, or if 
the entrance requirements consisted in twd 
years of college grounding in the liberal arts 
and sciences, the local scène would by degrees 
take on a’leas disagreeable odor. Undoubtedly 
institutions comparable to Carnegie are insist­
ing mòre and more on a fairly decent back­
ground. And some day Parnassus may come 
to Schenley Park.M. T. H.
