Annual Dollar 
Day Fund To 
Close Dec. 31
First Contributions Are 
On Par with Those 
Of Last Year
Contributions for the first week 
in the annual Carnegie Dollar Day 
Drive are on a par with those for 
the corresponding period of last 
year. The Dollar Day campaign 
began last Tuesday and will con­
tinue until December 31.
During the campaign all Car­
negie alumni will be urged to con­
tribute at-least one dollar, to this 
year’s Dollar Day fund. All money 
collected will be turned over to the 
Carnegie Tech Endowment Com­
mittee and will come under the 
two-for-one agreement with the 
Carnegie Corporation. This agree­
ment is that for every dollar raised 
by 19'16 for the Endowment Fund 
the corporation wilTgive the school 
two dollars, provided a total of 
four million dollars has been 
raisfcu.
Money raised by the Dollar Day 
campaign now will be invested and 
will earn interest from now until 
1946, so that after the. two-for-one 
agreement has gone into effect, the 
dollar given in 1933 will have in­
creased to five dollars.
The Dollar Day plan was origin­
ated by John L. Porter, vice chair­
man of the Carnegie Board of 
Trustees, and has been in opera­
tion six years. The campaign is 
not limited to alumni only but in­
cludes all friends of the school. 
Contributions can be made at any 
time during the year and still be 
accredited to the Dollar Day fund. 
Checks should be made payable to 
the Alumni Federation and sent to 
the Alumni Office.
The following persons contribut­
ed during the first two days of the 
campaign: Mary M. Eggers, Golda 
M Heminger, David C. Saylor, 
Eleanor M. Jackson, Dr. Thomas 
S. Baker, E. F. Hirsch, Louise Ir­

^omen’s Scholarship Organization 
Benefits Carnegie Women Students
By Anna Ladd 
The Women’s Scholarship Or­
ganization of Carnege Institute of 
echnology is an organization 
ormed to unite the women’s or- 
anizations on the campus in pro­
viding funds for ten scholarships 
be given each semester to wo- 
) |en of the schools of Fine Arts 
d Margaret Morrison. Scholar­
ships are awarded on the basis of 
Ability, character, and need.
|| Money for the scholarships to be 
warded each semester is raised 
by an annual theater benefit per­
formance. If there are any surplus 
jVunds after the ten scholarships 
been paid, they may be used 
s a working fund or more scholar­
ships may be created.
Members of the scholarship or- 
anization consist of the presidents 
'£ all women’s organizations on the 
campus. In the case that the presi­

Noel Coward’s
“\oung Idea
Begins Friday
Records Show No Other 
Performance on This 
Side of Atlantic
STAGED IN LONDON 
AS EARLY AS 1923
Coward Played .Tuvcnile 
Lead in Original London 
Production
"The Young Idea,” a modern 
drawing-room comedy written by 
Noel Coward and directed by Pro­
fessor Chester Wallace, will be 
prssented by the Department of 
Drama in the Little Theater, be­
ginning Friday night, for a run of 
six evening performances and at 
least one matinee. Definite an­
nouncement of the matinee, for 
which no tickets are required, will 
be posted on the school bulletin 
boards.
As far as available records show, 
this will be the first production of 
"The Young Idea” ever to be 
staged on this side of the Atlantic. 
Although it is Coward’s second 
play, and was produced in London 
as early as 1923 with two revivals 
since then, it was not published in 
this country until last summer.
The original London production 
of “The Young Idea” was, notwith­
standing, considered unusually suc­
cessful despite the fact that its 
satire was directed at the smart 
English hunting and shooting 
class. Coward himself played the 
juvenile lead, that of Sliolto, in 
this production and drew from a 
critic a comment to the effect that 
he was glad to see an actor so in­
terested in plays that lie would 
write one himself.
The plot, which brings about the 
reunion of a divorced couple 
through the irrepressible machina­
tions of the two “enfants terribles,” 
Gerda and Sliolto, is rather con­
ventional; but this ordinary plot 
fortified by the lines written by 
Mr. Coward, who with G. B. Shaw 
is considered by many critics the 
greatest of present-day English 
satirists, produces a light, frothy 
comedy which demands for its 
proper presentation a deft tech­
nique embodying these same quali­
ties. Beside its merits as.a train­
ing piece in drawing-room comedy 
technique, "The Young Idea,” be­
cause of its subject matter, is one 
of the few modern comedies avail­
able for production by the Depart­
ment of Drama.
The department will entertain 
the members of three local groups

ciety of Western Pennsylvania, the 
Robert Kennedy Duncan . Club of 
Mellon Institute, and the Seven 
Arts Society of Shadyside Acad­
emy.
ed from the two vice presidents by 
members of the outgoing organiza­
tion. In case of the ineligibility of 
both candidates, the president is 
elected from other junior members 
of the outgoing group.
The vice presidents are members- 
of the junior class and are elected 
from the incoming organization by 
the members. If there are less than 
six members of the junior class in 
the women’s Scholarship Organiza­
tion, 'junior members outside of 
the organization may be nominated 
for the positions. The two vice 
presidents work in close collabor­
ation with the president in all her 
duties.
The secretary is appointed by 
the president from the Department 
of Secretarial Studies and is a non­
voting member. She keeps . the 
minutes of all meetings, attends to 
all correspondence, posts notices, 
and keeps records of all offices and 
members of all committees.
The treasurer is elected by the 
incoming group and may or may 
not be a member of the organiza­
tion. Her duty is to keep a record 
of the finances of the organization, 
and make all deposits and disburse­
ments, with the approval of the or­
ganization. Elections are held dur­
ing the second semester and require 
a two-thirds vote of all the mem­
bers.

Fraternities Begin Annual 
Plebe Rushing Campaign
Interfraternity Council hit:oduces Revised Rules; 
Many Infractions of Regulations Have Been 
Reported; Violators To Be Penalized
Fraternity rushing season, which 
officially began a week ago Mon­
day, with the contacting period, is 
now in full swing. Actual rushing 
began yesterday and it is evident 
that this year it is being carried 
on with less excitement on the 
part of the fraternities and the 
freshmen than in previous years. 
This may be justly attributed to 
the contacting period which was 
first introduced as an element in 
the rushing .program last year. 
Despite the fact that competition 
is obviously keener this year be­
cause of the reduced number of 
freshmen from out-of-town, rush­
ing has become an orderly, system­
atic affair which merely involves 
the carrying out of the schedule ar­
ranged with the freshmen during 
contacting. The lengthening of 
the contacting period and the utili­
zation of the Thanksgiving vaca­
tion as a breathing spell between 
contacting and actual rushing aro 
the only ways in which this period 
differs from last year. This last 
factor has had a leveling effect on 
the fraternities as well as the 
freshmen in that it reduced the 
tension which always is apparent 
during rushing season.
It is regretahle that despite
Chairman of 
Annual Soph. 
Hop Is Chosen
Richard Hammond Heads 
Committee in Charge 
Of Annual Dance
Richard Hammond ’36, of the De­
partment of Commercial Engineer­
ing has been elected chairman of 
the committee in charge of this 
year’s Soph Hop which will bo 
held 011 January 12, 1934, in Thistle 
I-Iall. Mary Lord ’36, of the. De­
partment of Social Work, has been 
appointed assistant chairman of 
the committee.
Mr. Hammond is a member of Pi 
Kappa Alpha social fraternity, 
president of the sophomore-class 
in the College of Engineering, 
member of the student council and 
of Scimitar, men’s sophomore.hon­
orary society.
The assistant chairman, Mary 
Lord, is social chairman of Iho 
sophomore class, and a member ol' 
the Cwens, the women’s sopho­
more class, and a member of tho 
Cwens, the women’s sophomore 
honorary society.
The remainder of the committees 
are as follows: orchestra—John
Reese, xjhairman, Margaret Shultz, 
James Connor; tickets—Clifton 
Boutelle, chairman, Scott Charlos, 
Frank Sanford, Elizabeth Haw­
thorne; advertising—Sue Fuller, 
chairman, William Garrity, George

lips; decorating—James Hughes, 
chairman, James Latta, Alice Phil- 
pott, Norman Olson.
these adequate and fair provisions 
made by Interfraternity Council, 
many fraternities have not carried 
them out in the proper spirit. Dur­
ing contacting and Thanksgiving, 
an undercurrent of pre-rushing was 
noticeable and many infractions of 
the regulations have been report­
ed. Bradley Edelblut, president of 
the Interfraternity Council, has an­
nounced that because -vOf the un­
usually large number of infringe­
ments, the Council will make re­
visions in the rules for next year 
to Combat this undesirable element. 
Fraternities which have violated 
the rules this season will be pen­
alised, as prescribed, by a .$50 fine 
and the loss of intramural privi­
leges. Reports on fraternities in­
fringing upon the rules should bo, 
made to Austin H. McMunn, of 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, who is chair­
man of the rules for this year.
Freshmen, before pledging to a 
fraternity, should become thor­
oughly acquainted with all that 
pledgeship involves and should not 
be hesitant about asking any ques­
tions concerning the houses which 
interest»them. They should realize 
that pre-rushing on the part of 
fraternities does not indicate un­
usual interest but only poor sports­
manship, lack of integrity and 
other disregard for the rules of 
the fnterfraternity Council.
Women’s Jr. 
Prom Petition 
Is Approved
Reduction in Budget Is 
Requisite for Holding 
Separate Proms
The Junior Women’s petition for 
a seperato, closed Women’s Junior 
Prom has passod Student Council 
provided that one-third of tho ox- 
penses can ho guaranteed' by Feb­
ruary 1. Tho date sot for tho dance 
l.s-'i»; arch I).
A reduction in tho budget malcoa 
it possible to lower the prlco of 
admission from $5 to $3.50. Tills 
reduction in tho bud got was named 
by Student Council as a requisite 
for holding a separate Prom, in­
stead of the Combined Prom listod 
in tho Plebo Bible,
Tho Women’s Junior Prom is a 
closed dance to which only Junior 
and, Sonior women in Margaret 
Morrison and the College ol' Flno 
Arts may go. Tho responsibility of 
keeping tho Prom on tho calendar 
as a separate dance, thoroforo, 
rests with them, in tho past tho 
dance has lost money. If tho ex­
penses ol! tiie dance this year aro 
not covered, it Is probable that tho 
Women’s Junior Prom as a foaturo 
belonging only to Junior and 
Senior womon will no longer oxlst. 
Tho lowered admission should 
make a larger attendance posslblo. 
The tickets will be paid for in two 
installments, the first of which is 
$1.50 and is compulsory for all 
members of tho Junior class, 
whether they plan to attend tho 
prom or not.
New Cliem. Laboratory Will 
Open for Second Semester
Increased Facilities Wil Place Carnegie’s Chemical 
Engineering Department on Par with Those 
Of Best Tech Schools in Country
By Dudley Pendleton
The Chemical Engineering lab­
oratory which is being constructed 
in the basement of Engineering 
Hall will, when completed, put 
Carnegie’s chemical engineering 
facilities on a par with those’ of the 
first class technical schools in the 
country. The laboratory will be 
ready for use before the beginning 
of the second semester.
Some years ago a report of the 
study of the curriculum of chem­
ical engineering and chemistry 
courses in colleges in this country 
listed Carnegie near the bottom 
with respect to adequacy of equip­
ment and laboratories. Since then 
the organic laboratory has been 
augmented and a modern analytical 
laboratory built. The new Chem­
ical Engineering laboratory is the 
final step and should put Carnegie 
at the top of the list.
This new laboratory occupies 
the lower level of the easterly 
wing of Engineering Hall which 
was formerly tho mining engineer­
ing and ore dressing laboratory. 
The mine, once the goal of many 
exhibition night pilgrimages, is 
now a storage room and the loco­
motive and mine cars have disap­
peared. In their place have been 
set up the large pieces of appar­
atus which make up the equipment 
of the new laboratory.
The equipment which this lab­
oratory will place at the student's 
disposal includes an eighteen-foot 
continuous still, a double effect
evaporator, an absorption tower, a 
Proctor and Schwartz dryer, 
vacuum dryer, and several different 
types of filter presses. Other 
equipment will be later set up for 
the study of flow of fluids, heat 
transfer, and similar operations.
The laboratory itself occupies 
two levels, the second being a deep 
balcony which overlooks the main 
floor twelve feet below. The main 
floor with its twenty-seven foot 
ceiling harbours most of the equip­
ment while underneath the bal­
cony are two laboratories suitable 
for research, a large storage space, 
and a workshop. The balcony 
houses the ore dressing laboratory 
and the drying apparatus.
The Chemical Engineering lab 
oratory will be used for the study 
of fundamental unit operations of 
chemical manufacture. Instead of 
studying the processes connected 
with the production of a single 
product, the student .will study 
unit processes common to many 
Industries such as distillation, 
rectification, iieat transfer, evap­
oration, filtration, and drying. Tho 
pieces of apparatus which have 
boon installed are those which aro 
most often used In these unit op­
erations and on these engineering 
tests will be made in order to 
study the principles that govern 
their operation.
Whereas other chemical labora­
tories with which the student has 
come into contact deal only with 
small quantities of matter, this 
laboratory will give them an op­
portunity to deal with matter and 
problems on a larger scale.
The laboratory has’ been con­
structed under the supervision of 
Augustine H. Weitz of the Chem­
ical Engineering Department.

In General Studies
Major curricula changes in the 
various colleges were approved by 
the Educational Senate at its last 
meeting and are now subject to the 
approval of President Baker. Tho 
changes wore suggested by each 
department and were then passed 
by the curriculum committee of 
eacli college. The proposed changes 
were then referred to a sub-com- 
mitteee in the Educational Sennto 
of which Prof. William 11. Work 
is chairman. Passage by tho Sen­
ate followed and the approval ol! 
President Baker is now awaited.
Many of the changes in the engi­
neering curricula are the result oC 
a proposed change in the regula­
tion of the Educational Senate con­
cerning tho contents of courses, 
which was adopted on May 4, 1923. 
The resolution of 1923 read as fol­
lows :
"In a sorios of courses leading 
to tho degree, from 65 to 80 per 
cent of tho training should ho In 
tho development of professional 
knowledge and skill, while from 20 
to 35 per cent of tho training 
should ho In Imparting general ed­
ucational or cultural knowledge.' 
Those percentages are offoctivo 
beginning September, 1924.”
On Oct. 30, 1983, tho Curriculum 
Commlttoo of tho Collogo of Engi­
neering requested the Educational 
Senate to alter tho regulation of 
May -I. 1023, Tho committee pro­
pound tho following rule:
"Every curriculum loading to a 
dogroo must contain at least 72 
units choson from tho subjoots of­
fered by the following departments 
of the Division of General Studios:. 
English, History, Economics, Psy­
chology, Modern Languages, and

Tt would be difficult to locate a 
group of students who know less 
about the activities of campus or­
ganizations than the members sup­
posedly active therein. Consider 
the guileless endeavors of a group 
commonly known as "Tartan re­
porters” prying news from tho 
sources oil their stories. .
Tho process is something like 
that involved In collecting class 
dues or getting a final grade 
changed. Most reporters start out 
very conscientiously In soarch of 
fellow students who aro reputed to 
bo authorities on various activities 
on campus, Many of theso report- 
ors even succeeded In locating the 
proper sources. But few succeed 
In getting much farther.
Stories are ofton «ought over 
tho tolephono through conversa­
tions which aro accurate Indica­
tions of tho superior intelligence 
and rare wit of office-holding col­
lege students. A conversation may 
(or may not) go something like 
this: “Is tho X organization mak­
ing any plans to increase its mem­
bers this fall?” "Why—ah—I be­
lieve they are, hut I don’t seem to 
remember anything about it.” 
"Couldn't you tell me something
about, the proposed year’s activi­
ties of the organization?” “Well— 
ah—yes, just—uli—sort of increas» 
ing—or rather improving—I really 
couldn’t say just what they do— 
"Can you find out and I’ll call 
later.” "Yes Indeed, but I won’t 
be home.”
(Pause, while the reporter de­
cides that perhaps more informa­
tion could be Jiad if he weren’t at 
home.)
"Can you givo me the name of 
the vice presldont of the X organ­
ization, then, so I can call him?” 
"Why-a-a, i’m not sure of his 
name, but you know him, I’m sure 
—sort of little, not very big for hie 
size—has charge of the—what’s 
the name of that organization that 
moots In Room 354 every other 
Tuesday?”
"Can’t I meet you somowhoro to- 
mon’ow? In Skibo, or tho Grill? 
What time do you have lunch?” 
This hopefully from the reporter.
"Oh, most any time. Tell you 
what—I’ll just see you around. 
How’s that? Good-bye.” And tho 
worn-out reporter is left to dark 
thoughts about a man she has 
never seen. "I’ll just see you 
around.” If she goes to Skibo, ho 
is certain to bo in the Grill; and 
if she looks in the Grill for one 
Oscar Schmoytz, she runs the risk

MIHM STAB IN FINALTrojans Are Too Powerful 
For Southerners, Win 
By 31-0 Count
One of the season’s most excit­
ing upsets was exhibited Saturday 
in the Yankee Stadium where 
Hunk Anderson’s name was 
brought back into good repute 
among football mentors as the 
Irish toppled the Army eleven to 
a 13-12 victory. The game’ was 
one of lightning contrasts and 
placed a blot on the otherwise 
spotless Army schedule. Lukats, 
with dashes through a carefree 
Army line, brought defeat to the 
Cadets after victory seemed as­
sured them by a twelve point lead 
at the half.
Blue Devils Lose 
The Duke hopes to visit the 
Hollywood Bowl were dashed by 
defeat suffered at the hands of a 
classy passing and running attack 
dealt by Georgia Tech. The score 
which blew the Blue Devils’ dream 
occurred in the second quarter, 
when a series of passes brought 
the hall to the Duke 17-yard line. 
Davis varied the attack by running 
the ball over the goal behind per­
fect interference. The Yellow 
Jackets made their greatest stand 
to keep Duke from tying the score 
after the invaders had gained a 
first down on the Tech one-inch 
line. The score remained 6-0. 
Tigers Win Again 
Princeton remained the only un­
beaten and. untied major eleven of 
the country when it trounced Yale 
27 to 2 in the first three quarters 
of the game, although Eli scored 
first by blocking a punt in the first 
minutes of play. Yale completed 
an eighty-yard run in the last 
period against a line of Princeton 
subs, hut the attack on the Tigers’ 
goal was stopped with the first 
string of Princeton’s huskies. 
Georgia Swamped 
The Georgia Bulldogs were sadly 
defeated by the powerful Southern 
California team, which staged five 
mighty drives for long gains 
against the Southerners. Georgia 
neared the Trojans goal but once, 
during the second quarter, when a 
drive brought them to the U. S. C. 
lG-yard line, where the Trojans got 
the ball on downs. Line driving 
and two scoring passes netted the 
victory of 31-0 for U. S. C.

Once more the Tartans of Car­
negie Tech have fallen before the 
onslaught of their rivals, tho strong 
Golden Panthers from across the 
way. in a gamo which is the first 
of what promises to be an annual 
Thanksgiving Day classic, the 
Panthers gained their fifth suc­
cessive victory over the Plaid.
The Pitt team proved itself lo be 
one of the strongest which its 
Alma Mater has ever produced. In 
spite of the fact that the Blue and 
Gold had been previously defeated 
by Minnesota, they are considered 
to be greater than their prede­
cessors of last year, the Eastern 
representative at the Rose Bowl.
Tartans Not At Best
The Tartans put up a good fight 
against their opponents’ powerful 
attack, but did not come up to the 
standard which they had set for 
themselves earlier in the season. 
Partly due to several injuries and 
to the fact that they had not had 
sufficient time to recover from the 
N. Y. U. game the Saturday imme­
diately before Thanksgiving, Coach 
Harpster’s boys seem to be unable 
to bring forth the same stuff which 
they had exhibited against such 
teams as Notro Dame, Temple, and 
Purdue.
Stewart, Mlhm Show Class
Of course as usual there were 
several outstanding players al­
though every player was doing his 
part. For the Tartans, Capt. Stew­
art. heads the list. His game on 
Thursday was one of the best of 
his whole career, and proved him 
to he one of the best ends of the 
season. Burzio played his usual 
stellar gume, although he had to 
ho removed enrly in the fight due 
to injury, but I-Ielnzer and Dresluir 
proved themselves to be indis­
pensable guards, and carried on 
the good work. Joe Mlhm was re­
sponsible for tho one feature of 
the gamo In which Pitt was out­
done. Ills punting was up to his 
usual calibre and excelled that of 
the Pitt hooters.
Quito a I'ow of tho Tartans Baw 
their last hit of action on tho grid­
iron for their Alma Mater during 
the TlumltHglvIng gamo. Capt. 
Stewart and Burns, ends; Burzlo, 
ITolnzor, and Droshar, guards; 
O’Toolo, center; Forsmun, tackle; 
and Suylos, Bovevlno, and Brewer, 
hacks, have all played their last 
under the Plaid of Carnegie Tech.
IN NO GAMIO PLAYED THIS SEASON did the Carnegie players suffer 
through injuries us In the Pitt gamo. * Before tho gamo, neither of the 
regular right ends, Lewis and Goodridge, wore In good condition to 
play and both wore injured before the first half was out. The guards, 
too, were having a tough time. Btirzlo was practically pieced together 
with tape in order to pluy, and ho had to bo taken out for good in the 
second quarter. Helnzor was also hurt, but Coach Harpster had two 
reserves in Droshar and Anderson who stepped into the broach in 
great style. Both the Tartan centers, Trbovltch and O’Toole, were out 
at one time or other.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST SURPRISES of the game was the way that 
Joe Mihm outklcked Hogan and Munjas. Hogan Is probably one of 
the greatest puntero In the country, and his great work againot Notre 
Dame last year will not bo forgotten In theoe parte for years to come. 
His soventy-flve-yard boot from behind hlo own goal line In the Wash- 
Jeff game was another Impressive feat. It lo then quite remarkable 
that our Joe should give the Panther quarterback more than hlo 
money’s worth.
MORE FAVORITES FELL FROM THE SELECT CIRCLE this week. 
Tho most notable of tho victims were Army and Duke. The casualty 
list this year only goos to show that it is senseless to expect oven the 
greatest teams to go through the season undefeated. Princeton at 
present is the only undefeated and untied major team In the country, 
but tho soft schedule played by tho Tigers discounts their record 
greatly. In my opinion there are throe teams in the city of Pittsburgh 
alone that could blimp off Princeton any week of the year.
Army is tho prize example of a team that tries to got by without 
playing anyone of importance. Lot us consider tho Army schedule. 
They played Mercer, Virginia Military, Delaware, Illinois, Yale, Coe, 
Harvard, Penn Military, Navy, and Notre Dame. Of these teams, five 
aro setups and five are major colleges, but only two of the latter, 
Illinois and Notro Dame, are teams that could get up sweat on a really 
good loam this season.* * * * + *
CARNEGIE FOOTBALL FANS should rejoice that Purdue has been re­
signed for a game with the Tartans here next year. The last two 
Carnegic-Purdue games have beccn thrillers, and this should bo the be­
ginning of a long series of battles with tho Big Ten school.
We have heard rumors that Purdue is going to play Georgia Tech 
next year. Why not have a three-way tuosle every year between Pur­
due, Georgia Tech, and Carnegie Tech Inasmuch as this trio makes up 
the three major football-playing tochnlcal schools in the country7 
Something well worth while, It seems to me.******
ONE CARNEGIE GRID ENTHUSIAST has written in advocating 
schedule reform. Ho claims that tho times for the N. Y. II. and the 
Wash-.Toff games should, bo reversed. Ho argues that W. & J. In a 
strong starter hut a wash-out lato In the season; the record of tho 
Proxies for tho past three years sooms to boar out this contention. 
On tho other hand, N. Y. tJ. starts out In terrible shape and gets 
stronger as tho season wears on. By the time llioy gel, to Carnegie 
Tech they aro at their peak.
This fan also contends that Carnegie Tech spends loo much time 
on teams with doubtful prostlgo and should make overtures to such 
loams as Cornell, Dartmouth, and Princeton. Thoso teams aro not too 
tough, yet they draw tremendously well at tho gate bocauso of tholr 
groat teams In formor yours and boaause of tho prostlgo of tho schools thomsolvos.

of being eyed and asked her inten­
tions.
What Price News
Til desperation, the reporter prob­
ably calls a fraternity house and 
aslcs for a pledge of the X organ­
ization. After lengthy identifica­
tions, the pledge breaks his silence 
with the information that the or­
ganization is planning a dance for 
new pledges.
Committee for the dance? There 
probably won't be one—we do 
things that way, you know. Place 
of the dance? Oh, the Urban 
Room, or possibly Bill Green's. 
Date? . . . Don’t have one yet— 
how about you? . . . Oh, you mean 
the day? Well, probably in De­
cember or March—I really don’t 
know.
And one more reporter staggers 
off to bed to horrible dreams of 
the make-up editor waving a blav.- 
ing stick at her and yelling, “How 
about that story 011 the X organ­
ization—it’s spotted with a No. 2 
head, and there’s no-story.”
Idle Thoughts 
of an 
Idle Night 
Student
Night students who use trains 
on their way to and from school 
are reminded of the special rates 
that hold for students. Arrange­
ments to take advantage of these 
low rates can be made at the Reg­
istrar’s Oflice.
The special rates apply only to 
multi-trip tickets. Reductions 011 
single trip tickets naturally cannot 
be made. However, anyone who 
relies regularly upon the railroad 
for their transportation can realize 
a nice saving by taking advantage 
of this oiler.
Well! That’s over. The turkey 
has been duly interred, the pies 
and cakes are mere shadows of 
their former selves, and the heaps 
of mashed potatoes and dressing 
have disappeared, as the saying 
goes, “down the hatch.” From all 
reports, the Thanksgiving recess 
was a huge success for all con­
cerned. The combination of two 
nights without school, line food and 
(lie excellent dance that the Night 
Student Council provided made a 
line setting for the good time that 
everyone apparently had.
The best part of it all is that 
there were 110 casualties reported, 
aside from minor accidents such 
as one too many slices of pie, and 
so forth. And, now that it is all 
over, we can return to our studies 
with a new grip 011 ourselves and 
feel better fitted than ever to 
carry on.
This Saturday, December 9, 
there will be a gala gathering of 
the Night Clans at Thistlo Hall. 
On that evening the Arts students 
will put away their paints, pencils 
and mud, Industries will doff their 
overalls, engineers will hide their 
slid e-rules and all will mingle to 
enjoy an evening of dancing at 
“The Klanlchter’s Ball.”
The engagement of Gordon Clark 
and his Pennsylvanians insures the 
delightful production of rhythm, 
harmony and syncopation that is 
so pleasing to dance lovers. This 
popular Greensburg band has never 
played before at Carnegie, but it 
is well known about the district, 
having played for a number of 
dances at the Edgewood Club and 
other places. The committee is 
congratulating itself upon obtain­
ing such an attraction and is con­
vinced that, after Saturday, Car­
negie will hear more of Gordon 
Clark.
Guests for the evening include 
Dr. and Mrs. W. N. .Tones, Dean A. 
W. Tarbell, Miss Mary Green, Doan 
of Women, Dr. and Mrs. R. M. 
Ihrig, and Professor and Mrs. 
Leigliou.
The recent Santa Claus parade, 
closely followed by the march of 
the unemployed, gave sober-mind­
ed citizens much food for thought. 
The sequence of events suggested 
the minor tragedies that will take 
place in many homes on Christmas 
morning. To the older people, at 
least to many of them, Christmas 
has been just another day for the 
last few years. However, the chil­
dren must be considered. The de­
pression, as such, means nothing 
to them. The kindly old saint 
whose arrival they hopefully await 
is to them beyond the reach of all 
that.
Still, the fact remains that many 
families will be faced with the 
meager prospect of a cheerless 
Christmas. It is true that the 
spirit of the season is the main 
thing. At least, those who have 
never felt the pangs -of poverty 
say so. But, what honest individ­
ual will deny that a near-banquet, 
the traditional tree and the pres­
ents lend much to the enjoyment 
of the holiday?
If there is any possibility at all 
of any of us helping to prevent 
such tragedies, it is up to us to do 
so. it is not a duty. It is just a 
matter of forgetting ourselves, for­
getting that life is hard-boiled, and 
remembering that our support to 
the many charities who have taken 
upon themselves to brighten the 
juvenile Christmas is indispensa­
ble.
It is agreeable and gratifying to 
view the paintings exhibited this 
year by American artists. Ameri­
can art is beginning to amount to 
something. It is improving. *
The most notable improvements 
have been expressed in four quali­
ties: composition, style, material— 
whether subjective or objective— 
and craftsmanship. The results 
have proved this. The pictures 
exhibited are masterly, and there 
are many which alone are worth 
pages of discussion. Space per­
mits only an abbreviated review of 
a few which must be remembered 
by everyone as outstanding exam­
ples.
The first is a large painting by 
the American artist, Daniel Garber, 
“Mother and Son.’’ The people* 
have acclaimed it. One cannot 
help but notice the interest taken 
in the canvas. People look at it, 
are attracted, go on, and then re­
turn to look at it again. It is a 
sympathetic picture: two very
natural, interesting people engaged 
in a game of chess. It is not a 
photographic study; it is more 
than that. Every point of the 
finished -whole is exactly in har­
mony. There is nothing sensation­
al or blaring. It is a sincere, 
honest piece of work—good in line 
and form—pleasing in the applica­
tion of color. It achieves its effect 
pointedly and directly with an ab­
sence of apparent effort that ex­
cites admiration for the artist’s 
skill.
There are others. One is called 
"Into the World There Came a 
Soul Called Ida.” You may like 
it—or you may not. If you feel 
any power of purpose behind the 
thing—any worth-while purpose— 
you will say that it is good. If not 
you will call it a scream, or an 
atrocity. But you will have ad­
mitted that it stopped you—held 
you for a while.
Then there is the painting, “The 
Agitators.” The artist liked his 
agitators. He was kind to them. 
And Rockwell Kent’s lone picture 
—another mark of the decline and 
fall of Kent. It Is a sorrowful ex­
ample of the' successful artist who, 
having once achieved recognition 
and applause, lapses into a stage 
of production which does not equal 
his earlier work. Also, there are 
Pittsburgh’s representative works. 
They are deserving of much praise. 
We are thinking especially of 
Kostellow’s “After Dinner” and 
William Scliulgold’s "The Little 
Dancer.” This last painting has re­
ceived far too little comment, for 
William Schulgold is an artist who 
is deserving oil more column inches 
per newspaper. We shall have 
cause to read much of him and his 
work in the next few years.
First Council Event 
Season Is Big Hit 
With Students
iri It’s too bad we don’t have more 
^ time Off like we did during the past 
wo or three days. That’s the way 
h Df life, one thing after another. 
’a N’ow we have to get back into the 
gj larness again and take up where 
>ve left off. Assignments and what 
ai not, why it’s enough to drive one 
^ Loony.
Last week we made the state­
ment that the Thanksgiving Recess 
Dance was' going to be different. 
In spite' of this, whispers were 
heard to this effect—"The same old 
baloney, but we’ll go around any­
how.” The dance is now history 
and we stand, acquitted, for it was 
different. And that hardly tells 
the story.
One would have experienced dif­
ficulty on Friday night when enter­
ing the Gymnasium to recognize it 
as the huge, high domed room 
where Carnegie Tech trains her 
athletes and student body. A 
myriad of vari-colored lights were 
strung around the entire room, and, 
from these, twisted strands of 
crepe paper converged to a huge 
golden center light. The whole 
gave an effect of an immense 
canopy that seemed alive as it 
moved and swayed in the breeze.
The novelty of the affair did not 
end there. Will Ryslianek and his 
orchestra outdid ail their previous 
performances. They entered into 
the spirit of the occasion with a 
vigor that brought much applause 
from the audience. For the first 
time in the history of the night 
school dances held in the Gymna­
sium, the music was audible 
throughout the entire room. The 
loud speaker system saw to that, 
and for once the singer could be 
heard as well as seen. The use of 
Thistle Hall as a check room was 
also initiated and met with great 
commendation. The additional 
space at the •rear of the hall pro­
vided by this change in checking 
arrangements allowed just that 
much more room for the dancing 
couples.
But, why go on. Those that 
were there enioyed an evening that 
will not be forgotten for a long 
time, and those that were not there 
missed something and deserve our 
sympathy. Let this be a lesson to 
you and don’t fail to attend the 
next Council dance.
The affair is over. It was a 
huge success. The social commit­
tee and those others responsible 
for the arrangements are deserv­
ing of much commendation for the 
manner in which the entire affair 
was conducted.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT the dance last week at­
tracted all the notables but 
some of the “Old Guard” were 
missing. Time brings changes 
but memory lingers on.
THAT there were no physical 
casualties but the “Fall of the 
spirits” in the check room made 
strong men weep and women 
feel faint. What a pity that 
such an accident should happen 
before our very eyes.
THAT the Old Deal was very 
much in evidence and the New 
Deal thanks them for their val­
uable help while preparations 
were going 011 for the dance.
THAT the stack on top of 
Machinery Hall doesn’t belch 
out black smoke any more. 
Thanks N. C., but what does it 
mean?
THAT the old turk got a pain 
in the neck but had his ven­
geance by giving some of us a 
pain in the tummy.
THAT we have not heard 
from any of our brave hunters. 
What’s wrong, boys, was the 
aim bad or did the wild life 
outsmart you?
THAT there are only eighteen 
more shopping days until 
Christmas and . . . ouch,
please, I won’t mention It again, 
ouch, aw cut it out now and I’ll 
keep still.
THAT that’s that and I’ll be 
seenya.
Ah! the noble experiment is a 
¦thing of the past, at least, it will be 
Q. -when this ramble is read by the 
J majority of fellow consorts and co- 
j.. horts. Yes sir, Utah, that all im- 
z portant thirty-sixth state to ratify 
j the undoing of the hush, hush, 
pussyfoot or whatever appelation 
you wish to use, certainly is mak­
ing history for the west. Pennsyl­
vania or Ohio don’t have a chance, 
3 but then, who cares, just so that 
f -‘A/e get a clean slate once again.
a Funny thing, that prohibition. It 
_ wasn’t so very long ago that one 
H ¡vas prohibited from parking back 
jy Machinery Hall, now I noticed in 
lie Tartan that one can park back 
here, in fact one is invited.to do 
50. I wonder if that was a noble 
experiment too. or was it just an 
idea of somebody’s. If they keep on 
throwing open places to park it 
won’t be many moons before some 
more of the restricted territory is 
placed in the unrestricted class and 
then won’t there be a lot of parking 
.space available for our c^rs.
I don't know who’s to blame for 
'the lack of information about 
working on the Gymnasium. Work­
ing on the Gymnasium appears fun­
ny doesn't it, but after all that’s 
what is done when one sees what a 
face lifting the night students can 
do with a little bit of this and a- 
little bit of that placed just so. Any­
way, to get back to my story, there 
was }, all set to work on the-Gym­
nasium waiting for word announc­
ing the time and the hour and no 
J paper. Certainly I receive my 
! Tartan and the dope was in it, but 
! what good was that when 1 re­
ceived it Friday, the day after said 
operations took place. There, I 
lost a golden opportunity of get­
ting those valuable points so nec­
essary for the watch key the work­
ers are wearing. Wish that they 
| would speed the mail up, or sum-

Toward Culture in Engineering
Not in recent years has any action taken at Carnegie been 
of greater significance than is the proposal of the Curriculum 
Committee oi! the College of Engineering that “Every curricu­
lum heading to ft degree must contain at least 72 units chosen 
from! tlie subjects offered by the following departments ol: the 
Division, of General Studies: English, History, Economics, Psy­
chology, Modern Languages, and J-’Jiysical Education or the ac­
cepted. substitutes for the courses in physical, education.”
The proposal, is to alter the Educational Senate resolution 
adopted May 4, 1923, -which reads as follows: “In a series of 
courses leading to the degree, from 65 to 80 per cent oi tlie 
training should be in the development of professional knowl­
edge and skill, while from 20 to 35 per cent of the training 
should be in imparting general educational or cultural knowl­
edge. These percentages are effective beginning September, 
1924.”
The action can be interpreted in no oilier way than as a 
move toward the liberalization of the engineering curricula. 
Need for such liberalization has been recognized for years by 
technical and by practicing engineers. The Carnegie regula- 
t,ion of 1923 attempted to provide for the inclusion of cultural 
subjects in the curricula. The provision, however, never en­
joyed complete success because ol: the variety ol! opinions as to 
what constitutes a cultural subject. The original intent of the 
measuro was frequently defeated by considering as cultural 
what wore obviously technical subjects.
It is not true, of eourse, that engineering subjects lack cul­
tural value. Properly presented, science and engineering may 
be more liberalizing than routine drill in the so-called cultural 
subjects. Obviously, however, the intent ol! the Senate in the 
1923 regulation was that the engineering curricula should in­
clude a certain percentage ol! those non-professional humanistic 
sub j cots.
In making clear exactly what subjects may be considered 
cultural, lies the value of the new proposal. Not only does it do 
this, but it specifies in terms of units how many of such sub­
jects shall bo includod in tlio curricula.
This problem ol! tho inclusion of liberal, courses has boon 
tho sub.joel; oi! numerous studies. One ol' tho most recent and 
thorough is that ol! the Society for tho Promotion of Engineer" 
ing Education, entitled “A Report of tho Investigation of Engi­
neering Education, 1923-29,” and published in 1930, Answers 
to a questionnaire were received from somo 534 persons, includ­
ing teachers in llfi technical institutions, graduates, and prom­
inent engineers.
To tho question: “Should cultural subjects be required in 
engineering curricula?” answers as follows were received: 
Yes, (»().()%; No, li).()%; and non-committal, 14.4%- To the 
question: “Should they be given place of considerable, mod­
erate, or minor importance?” answers wore: Considerable,
15.4%; Moderate, (52,2%; Minor, 20,9%; and Unclassified, 
1.5%.
This study was made before the depression period and it is 
likely that a similar study made today would indicate an even 
greater demand for more culture in. engineering. These have 
boon hard years for all, but they have been especially hard for 
the man. of narrow training. That, practicing engineers havo a 
greater appreciation of the need for more liberal programs is 
indicated by a comparison of their replies with those ol! faculty 
members. To the question of whether cultural subjects should 
bo included in tho engineering curriculum, two-thirds of the 
teachers replied in the affirmative, one-fifth in the negative and 
the rest were non-committal. Of the engineers, all but 14% said 
they are of sufficient importance to warrant inclusion. As to 
the emphasis which should be given cultural subjects, teachers 
replied as follows: one-eighth, considerable; one-half, moder­
ate; and one-sixth, minor. Answering the same question, 57% 
of the engineers rated such subjects as of considerable import­
ance while one-fourth said they are indispensable to their intel­
lectual development.
Among those subjects suggested for inclusion in'the engi­
neering curricula by those answering the questionnaire were: 
literature, history, modern languages, psychology, economics, 
philosophy, political science, art, biology, geology, appreciation 
of music, history of architecture, history of science, ethics, evo­
lution, comparative religion, and history of art.
Practicing engineers apparently realize that the engineer 
with nothing but a narrow, even though thorough, study of 
mathematics, physics, mechanics, and the like, will be as out-of- 
place as the scholar who knows naught but the history of the 
rise and fall of the Roman Empire. A broad training is neces­
sary for all, be they bachelors of science or of arts. The time 
may come when liberal arts schools will iiiclude technical sub­
jects in their curricula.
Knowledge of one’s profession alone will not take a man 
far today. He must know something about this world in which 
lie is trying to make a living and about the people with whom 
he must work.
Wo predict that Carnegie engineers will find more in life, 
will be better engineers, and will be more useful citizens by 
virtuo of tho broader program now planned.
Rushing, Square and. Unfair
This editorial has a. dual purpose. It will not only attempt 
to keep the rushees from becoming pledges of an organization 
for which they are not suited but also it will try to provent fra­
ternities from pledging men who later regret their choice. 
These results both come from deception which is fostered either 
by weakness of the organization or from tho high pitch to 
•which many fraternities rise during Rushing Season.
To the fraternities it is only necessary to say, “Be natural. 
Don’t try to assume a false sense of comradeship with tho 
rushee. It is impossible to become very close to a man whom 
you have just met or at the best have only had fleeting glimpses 
of him prior to_ the opening of the regulation Rushing Season. 
When you deceive a. rushee you are only hurting yourself as he 
¦will ultimately _ discover the truth and will drop his 
pledge. This action often causes a man to lose a bid which he 
might otherwise take to an organization for which he is better 
suited. The fraternity only gains temporarily until the man 
drops his pledge.”
Obviously any action such as outlined above will often give
the plebe a wrong idea of the organization which is rushing 
him. Later he may regret the decision he has made and will 
be a detriment rather than an asset to his fraternity. Do not 
misunderstand, it is possible to become rather close to a man 
by the end of the week but such feeling can not result from 
momentary conversation such as is bound to occur when many 
men are considered.
The plebe should be on guard against falsities and beware 
of them. Tie should watch out for the “handshaker” and 
“backs!apper” who will call him “pal” one minute and forget 
his name the next. He should consider with greater weight the 
achievements of the organization which are time tried and in­
disputable.
One of the most regrettable incidents which occur during 
rushing week is the “mud slinging” to which many fraternities 
resort. Any organization which can not secure men on their 
own merits rather than by upbraiding, often untruthfully, their 
competitors, is not worth joining.
There is only one fault greater than the one just mentioned 
find that is pre-rushing and illegal rushing. Despite the fact 
that the Interfraternity Council has made definite rules regard­
ing the relationship between the fraternity man and the rushee, 
certain fraternities absolutely disregard the miles and break 
the trust placed in them. Every member of the Interfraternity 
Council knows that it is impossible for spies to guarantee the 
enforcement of rules, but trusts that fraternities will have suffi­
cient integrity to do their part.
The rushee should beware of the organization which breaks 
faith with those who have trusted it. If a group can not be 
honest in its rushing policies it can not be honest in the state­
ments it makes to the rushee.
It is not the purpose of the Tartan to influence any plebe 
in regards to the choice of his fraternity but to allow him to 
realize that he must not fall victim to dishonest policies and 
“mud-slinging,” sugar coated or otherwise.
THE ROUNDER
ON SECOND THOUGHT
By Will
Last week 4,000 Protestant pas­
tor« in Germany, heartened by the 
action of their headers, who resign­
ed from the cabinet that was to 
“nationalize'' religion in Germany, 
banded together to oppose Chan­
cellor Hitler’s movement to regi­
ment religion.
Regarding God as eternal and 
not a politician, this movement, in 
itself, is important' and justified. 
Yet, even more significant, I .think, 
is the fact that these German Luth­
erans have given Herr Hitler his 
first jolt. With this opposition lies 
the development of the first real 
fight put up in Germany against 
tiie National Socialists' scheme of 
affecting a "totalitarian” State in 
which every factor of life was to 
be subjugated to the one purpose 
of a State co-ordinated into a ma­
chine. While this stand of tlie 
clergymen is tho first outward sig­
nificant check of tho Nazi regime, 
it makes us conscious of certain 
oilier indications of a secret oppo­
sition—an undercurrent o,f activity 
that is being carried on in the 
form of secret meetings, tiny 
pamphlets which must be read 
with a magnifying glass, and other 
clever devices of anti-Nazi propa­
ganda.
There is opposition to Hitlerism, 
its terror and its aims—under­
ground opposition which is almost 
suicidal in its heroism and remark­
ably ingenious in its organization 
and its activities. It is composed 
of the shattered remains of tho 
former political parties—tho ofll- 
oial Communist Party, the Social 
Democratic Party and Social Dem­
ocratic Youth organization, and tlie
Landsberg
Communist Party Opposition — all 
forces trying to re-establish the 
Germany working class. It is 
small; it does not, at present, 
threaten the strength or the lead­
ership of the Nazi structure—but 
it is growing and possesses the po­
tential force that may some day 
acquire large enough proportions 
to make an open stand.
A strong factor in the strength 
of the Nazi Party is its ability to 
weave a spell about the populace. 
Functioning now in Germany is 
the greatest propaganda machine 
the world has ever seen. Behind 
it all is’ an amazing individual, Dr. 
Goebbels. Unquestionably, he is 
tlie most intelligent and resource­
ful of the Nazi leaders. Hitler and 
ills associates can inspire crowds to 
outbursts of nationalism. But when 
not amidst these surroundings, per­
haps the average German begins 
to consider that the most convinc­
ing voice for the desirability of 
the military ideal is Dr. Goebjiels 
who never saw the front or wore a 
uniform during the war—and the 
loudest voice proclaiming the ex­
cellence of the “aryan” type is this 
same blaclc-haired, non-aryan look­
ing person.
Nazi Germany immortalizes the 
hero and lauds courage and bra­
very. But there is a showing of 
remarkable courage in Germany 
now which must pass unnoticed. It 
is tho courage ol! those men who 
dare to buck Hitler. It is they 
who will preserve all that was 
good in German culture, all that 
was inspiring in German tradition, 
and all that was worth while in 
Gorman labor.
THE SLAUGHTER OP THE 
innocents is now in full progress. 
The same plebes who were public­
ly condemned to everlasting stu­
pidity a short time ago by the B. 
B. Frat Club wolves (For example: 
“They're ho dumb they think a log 
J,able is a piece of furniture.'') are 
now being hand-shaked, high pres­
sured, and hood-winked by those 
wolves—now gracefully attired in 
their very best (reserved for rush­
ing season) sheep’s clothing. And, 
as usual, they'll huff and they’ll 
puff till they’re blue in the face— 
but only to keep their house from 
falling down . . .
CONCERNING RUSHING SEASON 
the modern Mariner says: “Wo­
men, women, everywhere—and not 
a drop to drink.’’ And because of 
the existence of the condition which 
inspired the first phrase, many 
plebes are not quite sure whether 
they are being rushed by fraterni­
ties or sororities . . .
THE LAST FOOTBALL DANCE 
of the fifteenth dragons was quite 
a success. In fact, people came 
from all over the country to attend 
the function (Crash the cymbals. 
Cyril). Chuck Ehrich was there 
with the 1: Norma Lorenz from
Coshocton, Ohio. Harold Jaques 
was in his glory with Louise Klites 
from Johnstown, Pa. Gibby had 
the future Mrs. Gerhardt from Bal­
timore, Ginny Mueller. The local 
talent was well represented by 
Mike Allon and Betty Crane from 
Pitt (that horrid word), Bill Clem­
ents and Marg Griffin Stankey, 
John Fox and Veronica Kloos, Les 
Hill and Vida Hurst. The turkey 
which was (page Ripley) given 
away by tlie “boys”—and raiffled 
off very charmingly by Dragons 
Jagnow and Fenderson—was won 
by Harold Scmalz and Alice Na­
thaniel . .
BUT ENOUGH OF THE UNBEAU­
TIFUL. Let us dwell for a while 
upon the virtues and graces of 
Richard “Honeyboy” Wiberg. He 
was afllicted, the other day, with 
a common optical ailment: seeing 
double. This condition was cor­
rected, however, by a manoeuvre 
which is an excellent example or 
the ingenuity that is so typical of 
the Wiberg clan. I-Ie. closed one 
eye—and then,, as Dickie himself 
reports the affair: “I could see 
prime."
THE REAPPEARAiNCE OF THE 
fraternity fun festival reminds .us 
of the intelligence test which was 
the sensation of the last Soviet (i. 
e. rusliin’) season: “A man has
two coins. Their sum is thirty- 
five cents. One of them is not a 
dime. What are the two coins?” 
(To be concluded next week.)

Current OpinionH
COLLEGE MEN IN GOVERN 
MENT
“Students of America generally 
are shirking their public duty ir 
the fields of government and polit 
ical administration.”
The statement, made by Nicholas 
Roosevelt, former minister to Hun­
gary, and cousin of the president 
reveals a situation that is at onc^ 
paradoxical and unfortunate.
Students, with highly-traineo 
minds, with the vigor and enthu­
siasm of youth, can exert a power­
ful influence in government, yel 
there is an appalling lack of sucb 
interest among them. They criti­
cize, they argue, and they put for 
ward plans of political and eco 
nomic reform, but they do not ac­
tively participate in any movement 
which will bring about the changes 
they see fit to talk about.
The government, as has always 
been the case, needs the intelligent 
leadership that college men can 
give. Government is a science, not 
a duty which can be performed by 
any person qualified to vote, and 
government as a science will bejjf 
woefully neglected and improperly 
managed as long as university stu­
dents and men are content to see 
it in the hands of politicians whose 
claims to efficency in legislating 
are success in ward-heeling or the 
blessings of wealth and position.
Until college minds predominate 
in all branches ' of government, 
there will always be extravagance 
and political graft in government. 
Highly educated college men may 
not be above a reproach, but at 
least the public would benefit by 
the more technical knowledge 
which is at their disposal.—Cali­

Not so long ago practically all 
cigarettes were made by hand
Now, Chesterfields are made by high-speed machines 
that turn out 750 cigarettes a minute, and the 
cigarettes are practically not touched by hand.
TJ Y the use of long steel ovens 
—drying machines of the 
most modern tj'pe—and by age­
ing the leaf tobacco for 30 
months—like wine is aged—- 
Chesterfield tobacco is milder 
and tastes better.
Only pure cigarette paper— 
the best made — is used for 
Chesterfield.
And to make sure that every- 
tiiing that goes into Chesterfield 
is just right, expert chemists 
test all materials that are used
in any way in the manufacture.
Chesterfields are made and 
packed in clean, up-to-date fac­
tories, where the air is changed 
every 4V2 minutes. The mois­
ture-proof package, wrapped in 
Du Pont’s No. 300 Cellophane 
—the best made—reaches you 
just as if you went by the fac­
tory door.
In a letter to us, an emi­
nent scientist says:
"Chesterfield Cigarettes 
are just as pure as the 
water you drink. ”
(Jhesterfield cigarettes are just
as pure as tlie water you drink
