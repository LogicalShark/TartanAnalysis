Middle name Innovation 
“The Innovative Institute 
for the Innovation of In-
novated Institutes is truly 
a place where innovation 
meets innovation,” said the 
institute’s founder and chief 
inancial oficer Inna Vation 
in a university press release 
last Saturday. Vation is a 
Carnegie Mellon University 
graduate and, like many oth-
er students and graduates, 
an avid supporter of innova-
tion, institutes, and innova-
tive institutes. As of March 
22, 2017, Carnegie Mellon 
University is an oficial cor-
porate partner with the In-
stitute.
In an interview with The 
Tartan, we asked the found-
er what her motivation was 
for creating the Innovation 
Institute for the Innovation 
of Innovated Institutes.
 “It’s not enough to have 
a successful innovative in-
stitute. We want to be the 
best. We want to be the in-
stitute that innovates new 
innovative institutes, and we 
want to do it in an innovative 
way. It’s that simple,” Vation 
responded. The Tartan also 
had the opportunity to sit 
down with Noita Vonni, the 
Director of the Innovative 
Innovating Department for 
the Innovative Institute for 
the Innovation of Innovated 
Institutes. 
“It’s a very important de-
partment,” Vonni discussed. 
“Without innovation, it’s hard 
to imagine what innovating 
would look like. Imagine an 
institute with no innovating 
for its innovation. Our pas-
sion and our goal is to merge 
together concepts that 
wouldn’t normally be cohesive 
— such as innovation and in-
novation — and build a collab-
orative, innovative institute 
where institutes feel free 
to innovate innovative insti-
tutes.
Since its launch in Janu-
ary, the institute has already 
received a great deal of ac-
claim. The New York Times 
has referred to the institute 
as “the most innovative inno-
vative innovative since inno-
vative innovative innovative.” 
The Wall Street Journal 
described it as “an institute 
so institute that it institutes 
institutes institutes.” 
Science called it 
“institutionally innovated” and 
“innovatively institutional.” 
The Tartan surveyed 
Carnegie Mellon students 
on their opinions about the 
new partnership. Anisha 
Padwekar, senior computer 
science major and machine 
learning minor, responded 
“Will the food there still be 
CulinArt or..?” 
Junior chemistry major 
Karishma Manglani comment-
ed, “Is it by Mellon? If it is 
that’s really far. I’ll probably 
never go there anyways.” 
Indorica Sutradhar, a 
junior material science and 
engineering major with a mi-
nor in biomedical engineering, 
said “Yeah, I don’t care but 
can you guys ind out when 
the new Chipotle is supposed 
to open?” It’s pretty clear 
that students here have a 
true passion for innovation, 
innovation, innovation, insti-
tutes, and institutes. The in-
novative partnership is sure 
to innovate the entirety of 
the Carnegie Mellon’s inno-
vating community. 
Innovation is an institute 
innovated for innovate when 
innovated innovation institute 
for institute is institute in 
institute innovate innovated 
institute, and that’s what 
the Innovative Institute for 
the Innovation of Innovated 
Institutes is all about.

Covers her microwave
Earlier this month, 
Carnegie Mellon President 
Subra Suresh posted claims 
on Overheard at Carnegie 
Mellon, a Facebook group 
within the Carnegie Mellon 
community, that former-
President Jared L. Cohon 
wiretapped Suresh’s ofice. 
The president declared that 
Cohon had ordered Carnegie 
Mellon Police to spy on him 
at his home, former BNY 
Mellon Center, Suresh 
Tower.
Suresh’s posts followed a 
tirade about the low ratings 
for The Apprentice: Scotty 
the Scottie Dog, stating 
“How low has President 
Cohon gone to tapp [sic] 
my phone during the very 
sacred process. This is 
Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or 
sick) guy!” Suresh followed 
by claiming the situation 
was “Terrible!” and just 
like McCarthyism, or the 
act of making demagogic, 
reckless, and unsubstantiated 
accusations like the current 
federal administration. 
When asked to comment, 
the president’s ofice said 
that Suresh “irmly believes 
that Cohon may have, maybe, 
you know... it’s possible that 
he probably believes it.” 
One of Suresh’s current 
counselors tried to back 
the president’s claims by 
pointing out that “you can 
surveil someone through 
their phones, certainly 
through their television 
sets, even microwaves – I 
even saw someone building 
that in Newell-Simon the 
other day. We’re not one of 
the top robotics programs 
in the country for nothing!” 
In order to investigate 
these accusations, Carnegie 
Mellon student government 
has established a Judiciary 
Branch, where appointed 
members will serve until 
they have graduated and 
achieved tenure. Some 
members of student senate 
are demanding that these 
claims be taken seriously, 
while others are just 
confused as to who Cohon is. 
It remains to be seen 
how Suresh’s comments 
may be affected by Provost 
Jahanian’s email scandal.

Vocelli Pizza serves up the freshest ingredients, inest pie in Pittsburgh
IAN TANAYA
Revered culinary critic
For the typical college 
student, and really the typi-
cal human being, pizza is an 
essential staple in an enjoy-
able diet. Containing as many 
food groups as one desires 
and making even the least 
savory of toppings palatable 
to the pickiest of eaters, a 
good pizza truly transcends 
preconceived notions of what 
food really is. Pizza is a unit-
ing force that people across 
all cultures and experiences 
can share together.
Because it is so universal-
ly beloved, inding the best 
pizza is a nigh impossible 
task for an average person 
to achieve. With the origi-
nal ideas behind pizza lying 
in Italy, it is easy to assume 
that one must trek to distant 
lands in order to experience 
the best of what pizza is 
meant to be. While this idea 
certainly holds merit, the 
good old U.S. of A. has tak-
en its love of pizza to heart 
and churned out thousands 
of reputable establishments 
that seek to deliver the per-
fect pie. Many take up arms 
in the great pizza debate: 
New York Thin-Crust vs. Chi-
cago Deep-Dish. 
Both are excellent tem-
plates with armies of sup-
porters, but they all fail to 
compare to the one pie that 
rules them all: Vocelli Pizza. 
That’s right: the Pittsburgh-
based franchise trumps all 
pies in the world, offering 
the best prices one can get 
for the best pies possible. 
The pies are made with the 
freshest of ingredients: 
from squeezing cheese di-
rectly out of their specially 
bred cows to taking their 
vegetables out of the ground 
and throwing them straight 
onto the pies. Truly, there 
is no better option for pizza 
out there, so praise the food 
gods for your close proxim-
ity to Vocelli and the ability 
to use the tremendous value 
of the dining plan’s lexible 
spending dollars on it.

On March 31, Carnegie 
Mellon University President 
Subra Suresh announced 
his plan to release the UC 
Stones due to constant 
student-led protests and 
complaints. Since its grand 
opening in 2016, many have 
pointed out its troubling 
similarity between the 
stones’ coninement and 
the proposed policies of 
then-presidential candidate 
Donald J. Trump. Much like 
Trump’s policies, the binding 
of the stones prohibits them 
from living fulilling lives 
and conines them into nar-
row and unforgiving param-
eters. Discontent has been 
exhibited in various cre-
ative ways, including “free 
the UC Stones” enamel pins 
and moderately dank memes 
posted on the wildly popu-
lar Facebook page Carnegie 
Mellon Memes for Spicy 
Teens. Bravo, students of 
Carnegie Mellon University. 
Your endeavors to liber-
ate the stones have come to 
show that there is truth be-
hind the classic statement 
“the squeaky wheel gets the 
grease.” On May 21, 2017, 
in lieu of the last of inals 
being administered, Subra 
Suresh will liberate the UC 
Stones as they tumble down 
the Cut and achieve their i-
nal destinies.

Student nearly suffocates on Gates Elevator from contaminants associated with latulence, armpits
On Thursday, March 
30, sophomore statistics 
major Andy Wu boarded the 
Gates elevator on the third 
loor, destined for a group 
meeting in the seventh 
loor collaborative space. 
However, upon boarding, Wu 
was tragically pinned to the 
rear and, as a result, nearly 
suffocated.
Wu rode up and down 
the elevator in this fashion 
an estimated nine times be-
fore the air quality began to 
take a toll on his respiratory 
health. Pinned to the rear of 
the elevator Wu was too far 
from the fresh oxygen occa-
sionally wafting through the 
open doors. The air that Wu 
was forced to breathe con-
tained higher-than-normal 
concentrations of 3-methyl-
2-hexenoic acid, commonly 
found in underarm sweat, 
and hydrogen sulide, a main 
ingredient in latulence.
On the aforementioned 
ninth ride, Wu was inally 
able to dislodge himself. He 
limped through the elevator 
doors on the fourth loor 
before collapsing on an 
oddly shaped bench. 
There, he was discovered 
by a police oficer who 
alerted Emergency Medical 
Services.
According to a university 
spokesperson, “This is an im-
portant reminder to all of us 
that personal hygiene mat-
ters. It doesn’t just affect 
you — it affects everyone 
around you.”

As part of this year’s 
program of Energy Week at 
Carnegie Mellon, which con-
sisted of activities related to 
the energy sector and energy 
issues facing society, Carnegie 
Mellon students and members 
of the community had the 
chance to attend various lec-
tures given by distinguished 
professors and scientists 
working in energy-related 
?elds. Marcia McNutt, who 
last year became the presi-
dent of the National Academy 
of Sciences (NAS) and who 
was previously the ?rst female 
editor-in-chief of the journal 
Science and led the United 
States Geological Survey, 
gave one of the lectures.
The lecture began with 
Dr. Jared Cohon, the director 
of Scott Institute and former 
president of Carnegie Mel-
lon, giving a welcome ad-
dress and thanking the many 
sponsors of Energy Week. He 
introduced the role of Scott 
Institute in addressing to-
day’s energy issues and rec-
ognized the attendees who 
had played a major role in 
the institute. Next, Provost 
Farnam Jahanian introduced 
McNutt with a statement on 
how science is a core part of 
America’s national identity 
while also recognizing Cohon 
for the work he has done for 
the university, even after step-
ping down as university presi-
dent.
McNutt’s lecture primarily 
introduced different reports 
that the NAS has compiled 
over the years on energy-
sector related subjects. First, 
she brie?y described the his-
tory of the NAS, which was 
created by President Lincoln 
and chartered by Congress for 
the purpose of advising the 
legislative body. The NAS puts 
out around 200 reports a year 
on widely varying scienti?c 
disciplines, but McNutt em-
phasized that many of them 
match the themes of Energy 
Week: policy, research, educa-
tion, and looking toward the 
future. Through her lecture, 
McNutt aimed to showcase 
how useful these reports 
can be.
The ?rst report she 
introduced was a 2016 study, 
titled “Analytic Research 
Foundations for the Next 
Generation Electric Grid,” 
which described the charac-
teristics that a modernized 
energy grid should have in

Of all the colleges in the 
United States, 99.8 percent 
of them de?ne race with the 
same ?ve categories in their 
application process. When ap-
plying for health care, taking 
a standardized test, sending a 
child to day care, the same ?ve 
boxes are presented allow-
ing the participant to check 
as many as apply to them. It 
is no mere coincidence that 
all Americans have become 
accustomed to the categories 
of Native American, Asian, 
Black, White, and Native 
Paci?c Islander in generalizing 
the abstract concept of race. 
These categories exist and 
have existed since 1997, when 
they were introduced by the 
Of?ce of Management and 
Budget (OMB) to standardize 
the way we talk about race.
On Wednesday, March 29, 
Quayshawn Spencer, assistant 
professor of philosophy at the 
University of Pennsylvania, 
gave a lecture about race talk 
to members of the Carnegie 
Mellon University community 
in Baker Hall.
The event was 
co-sponsored by Carnegie 
Mellon University’s Victor M. 
Bearg Science and Humanities 
Scholars Speaker Series and 
the University Lecture Series. 
The title of the lecture, “A 
Radical Solution to the Race 
Problem,” shares the same 
name as a paper written by 
Spencer in 2014 on the same 
topic. Though Spencer is a 
philosopher, his concentration 
is within the philosophy of sci-
ence, which provides him with 
some background in biology. 
His radical solution to the race 
problem attempts to explain 
how we de?ne race currently 
in America, as well as impli-
cations of these de?nitions in 
medical, social, and political 
contexts.

Merit Badge University boy scouts practice ?rst aid skills 
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
Local boy scouts recently 
visited Carnegie Mellon 
University to learn important 
and potentially life-saving ?rst 
aid skills. In a demonstration, 
one scout showed the tech-
nique he learned to apply 
multiple chest compressions 
to a training doll, while two 
other scouts prepared an Au-
tomated External De?brillator 
machine and pretended to 
call for help.
Every year, Carnegie 
Mellon University partners 
with Merit Badge Univer-
sity (MBU) to allow over 200 
Pittsburgh boy scouts to uti-
lize the campus in order to 
learn important skills such as 
public speaking, chemistry, 
aviation, and engineering. 
The annual two-day event, 
hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s 
Alpha Phi Omega Kappa 
chapter, offers over 15 of the 
necessary courses the boy 
scouts need to take in order 
to earn their merit badges. 
Successfully completing these 
courses helps the scouts ful?ll 
some of the 21 required merit 
badges they need to be pro-
moted to Eagle Scouts.
This year, local Pitts-
burgh Emergency Medical 
Technicians (EMT) volun-
teered to teach the scouts’ ?rst 
aid course. This partnership 
with Pittsburgh EMTs means 
that not only do the scouts 
get to learn from the of?cials 
who have to be prepared to 
perform these skills everyday, 
but the EMTs also get to teach 
more people these important 
skills which bene?ts them 
as well.
According to Mark 
Pinchalk, it is helpful if pub-
lic bystanders are trained in 
performing CPR so that they 
are able to apply these skills 
while the EMTs are traveling 
to the area. “Any kind of CPR, 
it doesn’t have to be perfect, 
has been shown to improve 
survival,” Pinchalk said.
The scouts were also 
trained in recognizing signs of 
a heart attack, stroke, and hy-
pothermia. They also learned 
how to stop a person from 
bleeding.
Scoutmaster Scott Schre-
congost states that this train-
ing can prepare the scouts to 
be prepared to be of help in a 
variety of situations, such as 
when going camping, when 
playing with other kids, or 
even being at home.
Beth McKinstry, the scouts’ 
troop leader, has seen how 
these skills can be applied 
in the most unlikely of situa-
tions. While her son was a 16 
year-old Eagle Scout, he was 
able to help a woman who 
was going into shock from a 
car accident. When he came 
home, he told his mom that 
he was only able to help the 
woman because of the skills 
he learned as a boy scout.

New coding method allows computer systems to better identify faces in crowdsCarnegie Mellon students compete in this year’s Three Minute Thesis competition 
Thus far, nine students 
have been identi?ed as 
?nalists for Carnegie Mellon’s 
Three Minute Thesis competi-
tion, which challenges Ph.D. 
students to present a compel-
ling and easily understood 
presentation of their thesis 
and its signi?cance in just 
three minutes.
This is Carnegie Mellon 
University’s fourth year host-
ing the event, which started at 
the University of Queensland 
in 2008. Keith Webster, 
Dean of University Librar-
ies, brought the concept to 
Carnegie Mellon and now 
hosts the competition.
“Our students are doing 
such interesting, innovative, 
and complex work,” Webster 
said in a university press re-
lease. “It’s a joy to learn more 
about their research and 
see how they approach the 
challenge of conveying it to a 
non-specialist audience.”
This year, 78 graduate stu-
dents participated in 10 rounds 
of preliminary competitions, 
which has been the university’s 
highest number of participants 
in the competition.
Michael Craig, a doctoral 
student in the College of 
Engineering, will be partici-
pating in the program for his 
third time this year. His talk 
for this year is titled “Grid-
scale electricity storage: A help 
or hindrance for mitigating 
climate change?”
“Last year I got too involved 
in the details,” Craig said in 
a university press release. 
“But it’s such a good experi-
ence. More people should 
participate.”
Ania Jaroszewicz, who is 
pursuing a doctoral degree in 
behavioral decision research 
in Dietrich College’s Depart-
ment of Social and Decision 
Sciences, is competing this 
year for the ?rst time. She 
says that Three Minute The-
sis has given her an opportu-
nity to think about how she 
communicates her work to 
people who might use it to 
help shape policy or nonpro?t 
programming.
A panel of judges will 
select the overall winner and

DOMINIQUE ESCANDON
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet 
Writer of The Student 
Government. 
Here’s a candid confession: 
student government isn’t al-
ways sexy. Being in student 
government means spending 
days waiting for replies to 
emails. It means setting meet-
ing dates two to three weeks 
in advance, not only because 
the department head you’re 
meeting with has a busy 
schedule, but also because 
your own calendar is packed 
full. It means rede?ning your 
dreams over and over again 
to satisfy a large administra-
tion and complicated student 
body or trying to ?nd the line 
between dreaming big and 
dreaming up something af-
fordable and realistic. For me, 
it’s been marked with learn-
ing that my dream school, de-
spite having exceeded all my 
expectations in academia and 
opportunity, still has work 
to be done to ensure that all 
students feel empowered on 
campus.
It means ?lling notebooks 
with brainstorming sessions 
and resources for change. It 
means learning how to dig 
deep into the place you’ve 
called home and realize you 
can make a change, and it 
might even only take a few 
emails — which is how I got 
Carnegie Mellon to switch 
from Blue Books to its sus-
tainable counterpart, Green 
Books! It means surround-
ing yourself with a network 
of intelligent, passionate 
people through the Graduate 
Student Assembly, Senate, or 
Cabinet and setting up a game 
plan for how you are going to 
bring your project to success. 
It means meeting incredible 
administrators who guide 
you and inspire you with their 
dedication to this university.
Actually, thinking about it 
again, if you’re someone who 
loves to see and be a part of 
positive, sustainable change, 
maybe student government is 
still a little sexy.
Now, let’s bring it back 
around to student elections. 
The people in these positions 
matter. When I think about 
my time in Cabinet, and the 
opportunities we’ve all been 
granted to leave a mark on 
campus, I get so excited to see 
what will come next from the 
next wave of student govern-
ment representatives. How 
will they continue to push 
for the protection of our un-
documented students? How 
will they ensure that the stu-
dent body and administration 
learn how to empathize with 
and protect sexual assault 
survivors, ?rst-generation 
students, students with dis-
abilities or ?nancial insecu-
rity, and historically margin-
alized groups? There are so 
many opportunities to grow 
kindness on campus, and I 
look forward to not only see-
ing those actions happen, 
but also being able to express 
who I believe will best repre-
sent these groups through my 
vote.
These are the reasons why 
I’m voting in these student 
government elections. What 
are yours?
Deva Ramanan, associate 
professor of robotics at 
Carnegie Mellon, and 
Peiyun Hu, a Ph.D. candi-
date in robotics, have made 
signi?cant progress to allow 
computer vision systems to 
be able to detect tiny faces. 
This is due to an improved 
coding method that allows 
this system to look for larg-
er things associated with 
tiny objects.
Of the faces analyzed 
using Ramanan and Hu’s 
method, 81 percent proved 
to be actual faces. This is 
compared to the 29 to 64 
percent found using prior 
methods.
Ramanan describes this 
accuracy as being simi-
lar to spotting a toothpick 
in someone’s hand. “The 
toothpick is easier to see 
when you have hints that 
someone might be using a 
toothpick,” said Ramanan 
in a university press release. 
“For that, the orientation of 
the ?ngers and the motion 
and position of the hand are 
major clues.”
Similarly, to ?nd a face 
that may be only a few pix-
els in size, it helps to ?rst 
look for a body within the 
larger image, or to realize 
that an image also contains 
a crowd of people.
Ramanan and Hu’s 
method uses “foveal de-
scriptors” which allow them 
to encode context similar to 
how human vision is struc-
tured. The center of the 
human ?eld of vision is fo-
cused on the retina’s fovea, 
where visual acuity is high-
est. The foveal descriptor 
provides sharp detail for a 
small patch of the image, 
while blurring the peripher-
al image to understand the 
patch shown in high focus 
while not overwhelming the 
computer.
The researchers will 
present their ?ndings at 
the Computer Vision and 
Pattern Recognition con-
ference from July 21 –26 in 
Honolulu.
On Saturday, April 1, Pittsburghers for America, a new political action commitee, hosted a march to raise awareness for equitable and affordable access to quality healthcare. The march took place on Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park.

Boy scouts learn ?rst aid from Emergency Medical Technicians
McKinstry says her 
favorite part about being a 
troop leader is seeing the 
young boy scouts transform 
into men.
Akindele Davies, the 
Head MBU Chair of Alpha 
Phi Omega, Kappa chapter, 
along with Karen Kim and Lil-
lian Sheng, his co-chairs, was 
responsible for organizing 
MBU’s visit to Carnegie Mel-
lon. This included recruiting 
counselors, ordering sup-
plies, and setting up an event 
schedule. “Organizing MBU 
has taught me a lot about 
event/project planning, deal-
ing with adversity, and the 
importance of teamwork,” 
says Davies.
Most of all, he is glad that 
Alpha Phi Omega is able to 
allow the scouts to get the 
opportunity to work on their 
merit badges, since they 
contact Carnegie Mellon 
professors to volunteer as 
counselors for the scouts for 
subjects they need to have 
knowledge on to earn their 
merit badges.
Chemistry is one of the 
most popular subjects for 
the scouts, according to 
McKinstry. This is taught by 
Gizelle Sherwood, the Merit 
Badge Counselor for chem-
istry, as well as an assistant 
professor for chemistry at 
Carnegie Mellon. The appeal? 
“They get to blow things up,” 
said McKinstry.
Davies adds that “the cool 
thing about this class is that 
scouts not only get to learn 
about chemistry straight from 
a university chemistry profes-
sor, but they also get to do so 
in a university chemistry lab.”
Information regarding 
Merit Badge University’s next 
visit to Carnegie Mellon will 
be out later this year.
Marcia McNutt talks at CMU Energy Week
order to meet society’s future 
needs — for example, the need 
for alternative energy sources 
for electric cars. The charac-
teristics they found necessary 
include customer participation, 
integration of generation and 
storage options, new markets 
and operations, high quality of 
power, operation ef?ciency and 
asset optimization, and resilien-
cy against attacks and disasters.
She also emphasized the 
importance of the grid being 
able to handle and analyze 
large amounts of data in real-
time in optimizing the per-
formance. As an example of 
modernizing the grid, McNutt 
mentioned that her home 
in California is a home that 
produces as much energy as it 
uses via solar panels.
Another signi?cant report 
was one regarding the potential 
of using algae and cyanobacte-
ria as sources of future biofuels. 
Using algae as a biofuel source 
has several advantages — 
energy security, no net green-
house gas emissions, high bio-
mass productivity, and the fact 
that it doesn’t compete with 
food, unlike other crops that 
are grown for biofuels, such as 
corn. However, the NAS report 
concluded that more research 
is still needed to make algae 
biofuels sustainable in the long 
run.
McNutt also mentioned a 
rare two-nation study that was 
commissioned by both the U.S. 
and China. Because the U.S. 
and China are the two top en-
ergy consumers of the world, 
the nations agreed to jointly 
research areas of renewable en-
ergy development which would 
be ripe for cooperation rather 
than competition. The collabor-
ative areas identi?ed were basic 
and pre-commercial research, 
the proper mapping of produc-
tion sites, operations and man-
agement, recycling materials, 
and setting standards.
Another study that tied 
together policy and energy 
identi?ed the impacts of U.S. 
tax policy on greenhouse gas 
emissions. The report assesses 
different facets of U.S. energy-
related tax policies — fuel 
taxes, renewable energy pro-
duction credits, depletion al-
lowances for oil and gas, home 
ef?ciency improvement credits, 
nuclear decommissioning tax 
preference, and aviation fuel 
taxes — on the levels of green-
house gas emissions. The re-
port concluded that while fuel 
taxes, production credits, and 
ef?ciency improvement credits 
helped lower greenhouse gases, 
the depletion allowances and 
nuclear decommissioning tax 
preference did not have a sig-
ni?cant impact on greenhouse 
gas emissions.
McNutt highlighted one 
study that she thought was 
particularly important which 
discussed the hidden costs of 
energy sources such as coal, 
oil, natural gas, nuclear, wind, 
solar, and biofuels. The report 
concluded that the biggest 
quanti?able hidden costs were 
greenhouse gas emissions and 
pollution. It stated that devel-
oping tar sands would worsen 
both costs while using renew-
able energy sources would 
lower them.
McNutt mentioned an array 
of other studies, on topics 
from the impact of the Helium 
Privatization Act to the pros-
pects of LED lighting. She con-
cluded the lecture by thanking 
several people from Carnegie 
Mellon who contributed 
signi?cantly to the reports she 
presented.
At a post-lecture interview, 
McNutt was asked about her 
views on the upcoming March 
on Science, which will be held 
in cities nationwide on Earth 
Day, April 22.
“It is their civic duty to show 
their support for science, [and] 
to show that science matters,” 
she said in response.
She voices her concern 
whenever she hears people de-
nying well-established climate 
science, and takes to Twitter to 
point people in the right direc-
tion on the subject. However, 
she expressed a note of caution 
to people interested in partici-
pating in the march. “I think 
it’s important that they march 
for science — that they not 
march against anything else. 
I would be concerned if they 
marched against the budget, 
or they marched against the 
administration,” she argued.
Citing her familiarity with 
the budget process as the 
former director of the U.S. 
Geological Survey, she advised 
that people should not jump to 
conclusions about policies too 
early since it generally takes a 
long time for anything to be-
come law. Her primary con-
cern was that scientists would 
come across as a special inter-
est group, further politicizing 
what should be a neutral, fact-
based subject. But despite these 
concerns, she says that voicing 
support of science is something 
people “should be doing as 
citizens.”
TEDxCMU: Pivot presents human aspect to recent technological advancements
YIYUAN CHEN
Operations Manager
Organized and led by 16 
Carnegie Mellon students, the 
second annual TEDxCMU: 
Pivot was held on April 1. 
The team of students brought 
nine speakers and two per-
formance groups to the six-
hour event, including profes-
sors, students at Carnegie 
Mellon, and guest speakers 
recommended by sponsors.
Carnegie Mellon president 
Subra Suresh opened the 
event with a speech about 
the modern Fourth Industrial 
Revolution. He noted that 
technological innovations 
such as the internet, data 
science, arti?cial intelligence, 
and automated systems have 
revolutionized human life 
in the past decades. He also 
urged the audience to look 
at the humanities aspect of 
technology. After illustrat-
ing the importance of study-
ing the ethics of science and 
technologies from a historical 
perspective, he noted that the 
advancement of technology 
must be made in the context 
of human beings in order to 
bene?t human life.
Other guests included 
Michael Senatore, who 
discussed the meaning of “go-
ing viral.” Senatore became 
an internet sensation in his 
senior year of high school be-
cause of a video of him ?ip-
ping a water bottle at his high 
school talent show, which re-
ceived over 70 million views 
on YouTube. He claimed that 
the viral effect on the internet 
has allowed “unquali?ed 
people to do amazing things.”
Molly Steenson, an 
associate professor at 
Carnegie Mellon’s School of 
Design, talked about design 
and how visualization could 
bring inspirations to the re-
search and development of 
arti?cial intelligence.
Steven Chase, an assis-
tant professor of biomedi-
cal engineering at Carnegie 
Mellon and a faculty expert 
at BrainHub, showed his re-
search in developing a brain-
computer interface, and dem-
onstrated how measuring and 
simulating human neural ac-
tivities could bene?t disabled 
or paralyzed patients. He also 
discussed the challenges of 
building such an interface 
from the historical perspec-
tive and the development of 
arti?cial intelligence over the 
past 60 years.
Amy Blankson, a 
co-founder of Goodthink and 
an expert of positive psy-
chology, broadly discussed 
the upsides and downsides 
of innovations in mobile 
technologies.
Rebecca Nugent, a 
teaching professor at Carnegie 
Mellon’s department of sta-
tistics, raised the underesti-
mated issue of being “innu-
merate” and discussed how 
the concept is perceived in 
western culture. She noted 
that, while illiteracy is often 
regarded as the more obvi-
ous problem to solve, people’s 
attitude towards the subject 
of mathematics, statistics, 
and data science are often 
steered by the Western cul-
ture that labels mathematics 
as a “cold, hard, masculine,” 
and intimidating subjects.
Charlie White, the head 
of Carnegie Mellon’s School 
of Art, traced the history of 
photography to the early 
20th century, and noted vari-
ous trends within the photo-
graphs that re?ected the soci-
etal changes over the century.
Dr. Jeff Schneider, the 
current engineering head 
of machine learning at Uber 
Advanced Technologies 
Group  and a former research 
professor at Carnegie Mellon 
University, discussed the his-
tory and technology behind 
driverless vehicles. Not only 
did he outline the technology 
and challenges of arti?cial 
intelligence involved in this 
project, he also showed the 
bene?ts of driverless cars. He 
claimed that driverless tech-
nology can decrease automo-
bile-related accidents, fully 
utilize cars, save parking spac-
es, and decrease the amount 
of time people “waste” nowa-
days on commuting.
Eric Cyphers, a renowned 
cellist and sophomore student 
studying neuroscience at 
Carnegie Mellon, was the only 
student selected to speak at 
TEDxCMU this year. Cyphers 
shared his experience of com-
bining his academic interest in 
neuroscience and music. Pri-
or to coming to Carnegie Mel-
lon, Cyphers studied at Curtis 
Institute of Music and toured 
extensively around North 
America and Europe, working 
with musicians such as Yo-Yo 
Ma, Itzhak Perlman, and Lang 
Lang. His interdisciplinary 
interest in music and science 
had enriched his life and 
creativity. Two student groups 
also performed at TEDx-
CMU including the Exploded 
Ensemble, an electro-acoustic 
ensemble at Carnegie Mellon, 
and the K-Pop Dance Group.
“I consider this event as 
a huge success,” noted Yash 
Maheshwari, co-founder 
of TEDxCMU and a junior 
majoring in statistics and 
machine learning.
Around 400 students and 
guests attended the event, 
quadrupling the number of 
attendees from last year. 
The team of 16 Carnegie 
Mellon students have been 
preparing for this event since 
October, and was entirely 
supported by sponsors 
without drawing funds from 
Joint Funding Committee 
at Carnegie Mellon. Due to 
successful marketing and the 
improved quality of speakers, 
all 450 tickets were sold out 
one week before the event.
This year’s theme, Pivot, 
was chosen to represent 
the idea that TEDxCMU is 
building upon the founda-
tion of last year’s event. 
In response to a question 
about the future of TEDx-
CMU, Maheshwari said that 
it “should be an event that 
people on campus are looking 
forward to, like Tartan Hacks 
and Carnival.”
Spencer discusses implications of race categories in the U.S.
One strange nuance that 
may come to mind when 
one thinks critically about 
the number of times they’ve 
?lled out a form identifying 
themselves using OMB race 
talk is the separation between 
Hispanic and Latino and the 
?ve categories of race. This 
is because the OMB does not 
consider Hispanic and Latino 
to be races, but in an attempt 
to be inclusive, allows one to 
mention it as an ethnicity.
Why do we de?ne 
Hispanic and Latino as an 
ethnicity and not a race? 
Spencer argues that this is be-
cause race is greatly de?ned 
by one’s ancestral continen-
tal origin. The OMB couldn’t 
allow such a wide spanning 
cross-continental group to 
be de?ned as a race because 
it would cause serious issues 
in a medical context. Spen-
cer showed that statistically, 
where you’re from in the 
world can act as a predictor 
for what your race is. This is 
important in a medical con-
text as it’s easier to know 
what diseases you are likely to 
be more susceptible to based 
on the origin of your genome.
Given his philosophical 
background, Spencer’s ar-
gument combined a strong 
statistical argument with 
sociological considerations. 
Spencer made his argument 
accessible to those with little 
to no background in philoso-
phy or statistics while still 
including the intellectual 
complexities of his evidence 
in a meaningful way for the 
more familiar members of the 
audience.
The unambiguous na-
ture of his dialogue was 
strengthened by the contin-
ued consideration and men-
tion of fellow philosophers 
in the discussion of race talk. 
Spencer even included some 
objections brought forward 
by students who’d attended 
the lecture during this series 
at other universities, encour-
aging the audience to bring 
forward their own insightful 
questions for a chance to be 
featured in future lectures.
At the core of Spencer’s 
argument is a differentia-
tion between monism and 
his radical solution of plural-
ism. Monism, in the context 
of OMB race talk, is the belief 
that OMB race talk is the one 
true de?nition of race and 
that there are no exceptions 
to this de?nition. Pluralism 
recognizes the many nuances 
in human identity. Depend-
ing on context, one de?nition 
of race might be more correct 
than another. Pluralism is 
the belief that multiple de?-
nitions can coexist even if at 
points they contradict each 
other.
Following Spencer’s 
prepared presentation, much 
of the audience remained, 
eager to ask questions about 
his conception of race. Dur-
ing this session, some param-
eters were de?ned that had 
not been completely clear 
initially.
The theory Spencer 
presented was not answering 
the question of how should 
we talk about race in the 
American context, but in-
stead attempted to correctly 
de?ne the way we currently 
talk about race.
Many questions followed 
concerning how we should 
talk about race, which 
Spencer answered broadly 
since it is the topic of his next 
book. Spencer also made 
clear that this concept of plu-
ralism does not apply inter-
nationally. In some countries, 
you are de?ned by a single 
race which is printed on your 
ID card. Spencer pointed 
out that it would be hard for 
Americans to imagine car-
rying a driver’s license that 
listed one of four race cat-
egories which encompass the 
diversity of our population.

Media should re?ect immigrant experiences
LYDIA GREEN
The 2016 election season, with 
Donald Trump’s discussion of walls 
and bans, brought immigration is-
sues into public consciousness. His 
more recent executive order at-
tempts at a Muslim ban have held 
them there. Although this is a de-
bate about immigrants, immigrants 
and their families are largely not giv-
en a voice in it. This week, I sat down 
with three different ?rst-generation 
Carnegie Mellon students to discuss 
the representation of immigrants 
and the children of immigrants in 
the media.
A common theme of these con-
versations was about how American 
immigrants are an especially hard-
working group of people. Jai Ghose, 
a junior math major with parents 
from India, said that while growing 
up his parents especially empha-
sized the importance of working 
hard because they were immigrants: 
“for a lot of [immigrants], they’re 
like, ‘We have to work this much 
harder to get this.’ They didn’t have 
the same support structures [as 
other Americans].” Ghose strikes on 
an important point — a new immi-
grant coming to America has to en-
tirely start over in a country where 
they probably don’t know many 
people and may not even know the 
language but have to assimilate to 
American culture and ?nd a way to 
support their families anyway.
Another student points out that 
an immigrant’s ability to be happy 
and successful in America largely de-
pends on their ability to remain con-
nected to the culture of their native 
country. He says that his Colombian 
mother remains in constant contact 
with her sisters in Colombia and 
they visit each other often. The stu-
dent’s father, on the other hand, is 
from Cuba and has had far less op-
portunity to remain connected to 
his homeland. Because of America’s 
complicated relationship with Cuba 
his father could not return to Cuba 
for visits, which was especially dif-
?cult when his mother died and he 
was unable to attend her funeral. 
Even calling Cuba was not usually 
an option as the Cuban government 
has driven up the prices of incoming 
phone calls from the U.S.
The student says that while his 
mother is overwhelmingly glad she 
came to America and now fully con-
siders it her home, his father’s feel-
ings about having come to America 
have been much more complicated. 
The student relates his father’s ex-
perience of being cut off from his 
homeland to the experience of being 
cut off from one’s mother: “It’s like, 
oh, you can no longer speak to your 
mother. She’s there theoretically, 
somewhere faraway, but you can’t 
just talk to her. You have no com-
munication with her. That’s a hard 
thing to do... and with the aspect of 
culture, it can be kind of shocking... 
foods and things you’ve grown ac-
customed to for your whole lifetime 
suddenly change.”
Despite all the challenges that 
immigrating to America necessar-
ily entails, immigrants overwhelm-
ingly succeed. As Madeline Kim, a 
Tepper ?rst-year with Korean par-
ents, notes, “[Immigrants] are more 
likely to attend college ... and they 
actually add economic prosperity 
to America. They bring more jobs 
— they might start a new company 
or might otherwise open up new 
opportunities.”
Ghose’s and Kim’s parents came 
to America for education while 
the third student’s parents came 
to America to work. These cases 
are fairly typical, as most immi-
grants (both documented and un-
documented) come here to get jobs 
and support their families, yet the 
news media routinely portrays im-
migrants as entitled and criminal. 
These negative portrayals have se-
verely negative effects on politics 
and worsen subconscious biases 
against immigrants and refugees.
The students expressed that the 
rampancy of two-dimensional ste-
reotypes has pervaded their every-
day lives. Ghose and Kim both grap-
ple with the effects of the stereotype 
that Asian people are smarter. This 
seemingly positive stereotype has, 
nevertheless, distinctly negative 
consequences in real life. Ghose 
commented that people always as-
sume he’s good at math and will 
randomly ask him to help them with 
their math homework, but he wishes 
that people would see him as more 
of a complete human being. “A lot 
of people are hardwired [to stereo-
type me], so I have to always make 
a good ?rst impression to show that 
I’m more well-rounded as an indi-
vidual,” he said.
Similarly, Kim told me about a 
teacher she had once who would 
constantly talk about how her Asian 
students were so smart and then 
would grade them more harshly 
than other students. Growing up 
Korean in a small, predominantly 
white town in Alabama, Kim en-
countered many people making 
false assumptions about her, most 
with the implication that she was 
somehow different or foreign be-
cause she was Asian. For one thing, 
people would assume that she didn’t 
speak English or didn’t speak it well, 
even though she has lived in Ameri-
ca her entire life. Or, despite the fact 
that she got an almost perfect score 
on her driver’s test, people would 
assume she was a bad driver before 
even getting in the car with her. 
These stereotypes are seemingly lit-
tle things, but when they are taken 
as reality and repeated frequently, 
it can have a dehumanizing effect. 
Like Ghose, Kim wishes that people 
would see her as more of an equal 
human being to them: “As cliché as 
it is, we’re not all that different,” she 
stated.

The biggest issue with current media 
narratives is that they don’t capture 
the full range of experiences and 
personalities [of immigrants].

Recently, the drafts of six White 
House executive orders that 
outline plans to heav-
ily crack down on 
the immigrant 
population in 
the U.S. have 
been leaked 
to Vox. Two 
of these drafts 
have already been 
introduced as executive orders on 
immigration at the border wall. An-
other draft has been introduced as 
the “Muslim ban” that temporarily 
banned entry from seven countries. 
The remaining three plans move to 
end programs that allow immigrants 
to come and work in the U.S. While 
the orders have not been con?rmed, 
they align with President Donald 
Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric.
The ?rst of these unreleased 
orders moves to rescind President 
Barack Obama’s Deferred Action 
Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The 
DACA protects undocumented peo-
ple coming to the U.S. who are under 
16, are in school, and have no felo-
nies from immediate deportation. 
While permits issued under DACA 
are set to begin expiring without re-
newal, Trump plans not only to make 
them expire sooner than anticipat-
ed, but also to ensure that new per-
mits are not issued. This could cause 
a mass exodus of young immigrants 
who have done nothing wrong. It 
would also force children to pay for a 
decision they did not even make.
This executive order also aims to 
put an end to Obama’s attempt to 
extend the DACA to cover more im-
migrants. Deferred Action for Par-
ents of Americans (DAPA) sought to 
protect the parents of U.S. born chil-
dren. While DAPA has already been 
blocked in court, Trump’s execu-
tive order would also eliminate the 
DACA on which it was based, mak-
ing further efforts to protect immi-
grant parents even harder to move 
forward.
The second executive order plans 
to make the metrics for legal immi-
gration even harder to meet. One of 
the ways legal immigration will be 
made more dif?cult is through the 
reversal of the Optional Practical 
Training work visa (OPT) extension 
added by the Department of Home-
land Security. OPT is a time period 
that allows full time undergraduate 
and graduate students who have ?n-
ished or have been pursuing a degree 
for nine months to work for a year on 
a student visa to gain practical train-
ing in their ?eld. This allows interna-
tional students to pursue internships 
and other work experiences related 
to their ?eld.
The reversal of OPT is something 
that heavily impacts the Carnegie 
Mellon community, especially when 
most companies are only looking to 
hire full time employees who have in-
ternship experience. 
The purpose 
of OPT is to enhance international 
students’ learning experiences by 
allowing them to also pursue jobs 
in their ?elds. Without this aspect 
their U.S. education is incomplete, 
with international students being 
given a back seat to the experience 
of American students. Limiting in-
ternational students’ access to in-
ternships with U.S. companies al-
most eliminates their chances at full 
time careers with these companies. 
While the executive order states that 
its purpose is to prioritize “the inter-
ests of American workers and — to 
the maximum degree possible — the 
jobs, wages, and well-being of those 
workers,” it also refuses to reward a 
large portion of the college popula-
tion that works just as hard, if not 
harder than American students for 
their degree.
This order also moves to reverse 
Obama’s decision to allow spouses 
of H-1B visa holders access to work 
visas. The H-1B visa is what al-
lows U.S. employers to temporarily 
hire foreign employees. By denying 
spouses access to work visas, it limits 
a household of at least two people to 
a single income, making it that much 
harder for immigrants to achieve the 
“American Dream.” It’s another bar-
rier that forces the tired, poor, hud-
dled masses yearning to be free to 
be prisoner to an unfair immigration 
system.
Another provision in this order 
plans to get rid of the relief Obama 
granted for those eligible for green 
cards, but who are unable to apply 
because of the three and ten year 
bars. When an immigrant has been 
in the U.S. illegally for more than 
180 days, they are barred from en-
tering the country for three years 
and if they are unlawfully here for 
more than a year, they are barred 
from the country for ten years. This 
makes it impossible for those who 
want to receive citizenship to do so 
without risking deportation.
As if the aforementioned wasn’t 
enough for a single executive order, 
the last big impact that this order 
would have is to allow the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (DHS) 
to conduct site visits at places that 
employ L-1 visa workers. The 
goal is for the site vis-
its to eventually 
expand to all 
employment-based visa programs. 
L-1 visas allow foreign workers with 
specialized knowledge to continue 
employment in the U.S. with the 
same employer. It’s clear that the 
common theme in this executive or-
der is to make the process for immi-
grants to secure work in the U.S. as 
hard as possible.
The leaked ?nal executive or-
der also tackles a number of issues. 
The order speci?cally uses the term 
“alien” to refer to both illegal and 
legal immigrants. The ?rst provi-
sion it puts forward is to ensure that 
sponsors of immigrants reimburse 
the government for the cost of wel-
fare bene?ts provided to their im-
migrants. This is something that 
will eliminate the incentive for 
companies and sponsors to endorse 
immigrants.
The provision also calls for the 
Director of the Of?ce of Manage-
ment and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, 
“to compile a report detailing how 
the federal government will save 
$100 billion by ensuring that aliens 
receive only the public bene?ts that 
they are eligible to receive.” This 
report seems to be just another in-
stance of Trump throwing out large 
numbers to convince Americans that 
immigrants cost us more than they 
bene?t, despite how much immi-
grants stimulate our economy and 
job force.
Another provision outlined by 
this executive order allows the DHS 
and State Department to decide 
on new standards and regulations 
for immigrants requiring public as-
sistance. The rest of this executive 
order outlines various reports that 
would be compiled about the impact 
of immigrants in the U.S. Though we 
have not seen what a report of this 
nature would look like, The Tartan’s 
guess is that it would not paint immi-
grants in a ?attering light just based 
on the president’s attitude towards 
them.
If these executive orders go into 
effect, which seems likely based on 
the status of the ?rst three, it could 
entirely reshape the immigrant pop-
ulation in our country. Trump has 
brainwashed some Americans into 
thinking the reason that they aren’t 
getting jobs is because immigrants 
are stealing them. He’s failing to ac-
knowledge all the work that immi-
grants do for Americans, sometimes 
jobs that American entitlement stops 
us from pursuing ourselves.
These orders could also make the 
employment for international stu-
dents at Carnegie Mellon a lot hard-
er. They come here to receive one of 
the best educations in the world, and 
Trump wants to make it even harder 
for them to use that knowledge in the 
American workforce. Immigrants are 
the backbone of this country and 
without their knowledge, creativ-
ity, passion, and ingenuity, America 
would not advance. What Trump 
needs to realize is that these orders 
not only hurt immigrants, but they 
hurt Americans, too.

Negative media stereotypes harm perception of immigrants
Title IX should protect the innocent, not shield the guilty
IMMIGRANT NARRATIVE from B4
Holly Liu/Junior Staff Artist
Paola Mathus/Staff Artist
of a very different nature — Latino 
men are often stereotyped as crimi-
nals. He told me a story about how 
one time he was buying mayonnaise 
at Giant Eagle but didn’t know which 
kind to buy, so, as any other college 
student would, he called his mother. 
Because he speaks to his mother in 
Spanish, he said that many people 
in the grocery store gave him weird 
looks like they were assuming that 
he was conducting gang activity. It’s 
ironic that even such an innocent 
conversation could be perceived 
as malicious simply because of ste-
reotypes surrounding the Spanish 
language.
These stereotypes don’t come out 
of nowhere: they are drilled into 
people’s heads over decades through 
movies, television, and skewed news 
stories. Asians are portrayed as a 
model minority while Hispanics are 
demonized. The students I spoke to 
all agreed that a more holistic repre-
sentation of immigrants in the media 
is needed. They seemed to feel that 
the biggest issue with current media 
narratives is that they don’t capture 
the full range of experiences and per-
sonalities. Negative or stereotypical 
portrayals are acceptable as long as 
positive portrayals and well-rounded 
characters also exist. More recently, 
however, good media representations 
of immigrants and ?rst-generation 
Americans have started to crop up. 
The students listed Master Of None, 
Fresh Off the Boat, and recent epi-
sodes of Law and Order: Special Vic-
tims Unit as examples of media that 
portray immigrants as complex hu-
man beings with both strengths and 
weaknesses, expose microaggres-
sions, and highlight characters’ cul-
tures without making their cultures 
be their de?ning character traits. No-
tably, two of these shows were made 
by ?rst-generation Americans.
As the student of Colombian and 
Cuban heritage said, “Immigrants 
are actual human beings who are try-
ing to make a living, who are trying 
to feed their children... [to not have 
accurate media representation of 
them] is dumb, because we’re a coun-
try built on immigrants.” Immigrants 
founded this nation and have made 
it the country it is today, the least we 
can do in return is recognize them in 
our American media and give them 
credit for their work.

Last week, outcry broke out on 
Overheard at Carnegie Mellon when 
a Medium post by a Carnegie Mellon 
graduate was shared, titled “Em-
powering my Rapist and Revic-
timizing Me.” While controversy 
brewed about the authentic-
ity of the events described in 
the article, it created a surge 
in attention on the matter 
and caused people to raise 
a number of questions 
about the transparency 
of sexual assault cases 
at Carnegie Mellon and 
college campuses in 
general.
Based on the 
email sent out by 
Vice President of 
Student Affairs Gina 
Casalegno in re-
sponse to the Over-
heard at Carnegie 
Mellon post, it is 
clear that the uni-
versity does not 
take these matters 
lightly and under-
stands the impor-
tance of providing 
educational and 
support programs to 
ensure that sexual as-
sault is prevented and 
handled properly. As 
a witness in a stalking 
case, it was clear that 
the people I worked with 
in the university cared 
greatly about handling 
such cases in a proper man-
ner and bringing justice and 
safety to victims.
However, a national policy 
that works to protect the guilty more 
than the victim sets legal precedents 
that can be destructive to college 
campus communities and potentially 
endangering to students.
In the comments section of this 
post, one student wrote, “Why don’t 
students receive crime alerts when a 
student sexually assaults another?” 
The answer comes from a law created 
in 1974 that was not even intended to 
deal with sexual assault. The Fed-
eral Educational Rights and Privacy 
Act (FERPA) was written to protect 
the privacy of students’ academic 
transcripts.
However, its vague wording has 
caused it to be used in far more sce-
narios than intended by primary au-
thor, Senator James L. Buckley. Frank 
LoMonte, executive director of the 
Student Press Law Center, even goes 
as far to say that its unintended inter-
pretations from being a law meant 
to protect academic transcripts to 
one silencing rape cases have trans-
formed it into the “Federal Rapists 
Protection Act.” FERPA is commonly 
used by universities to prevent sex-
ual assault case results from being 
published and shared with mem-
bers of the community against their 
best interests.
According to The New York Times 
reporter Jon Krakauer, “When uni-
versities want to deny public access 
to information that might blemish 
their reputations, they routinely 
claim that FERPA prevents them 
from disclosing such information 
— even when disclosure is plainly 
warranted. In many instances, the 
suppressed records concern sexual 
assault complaints.”
He then goes on to describe a 
case he was investigat-
ing of a University 
of Montana 
football player who was found 
guilty of rape but was then not ex-
pelled after a far-from-transparent 
repeal process. The University of 
Montana attempted to use FERPA to 
shield any information on the case 
from the reporter and was almost 
successful due to the ?exibility of its 
interpretations.
According to the National 
Women’s Law Center, FERPA allows 
“the ?nal results of any college dis-
ciplinary proceeding for a violent 
crime or sex offense that concludes 
the accused broke a school rule or 
policy to a third party” to be released 
to witnesses, student groups, and 
reporters. However, colleges like the 
University of Montana have clearly 
overstepped their boundaries and 
put their interests before their com-
munities’ interests in their interpre-
tations of FERPA.
In the case of the Overheard at 
Carnegie Mellon Medium post, the 
accused student was found not guilty 
and, therefore, had the right to priva-
cy. This is understandable because if 
there is even a chance that the accu-
sation is false, the tarnishing of this 
student’s reputation and future could 
affect him for a lifetime. According 
to Slate, eight percent of rape accu-
sations are reported by police to be 
“unfounded,” so false accusations are 
a reality and should be properly han-
dled. While people have the right to 
be angry about such cases, we must 
remember that America is a country 
built on the foundation 
of innocence until 
proven guilty.
In the case of a guilty verdict or 
a false accusation beyond a reason-
able doubt, students and members 
of the campus community should be 
given the right to access such infor-
mation, and cases like the University 
of Montana one described in The New 
York Times article above must cease 
using FERPA as a gag order to hide 
information that could be crucial for 
their students’ safety. In order to en-
sure that such cases do not happen, 
FERPA must be rewritten in a way 
that preserves the privacy of students 
but is worded in a way that prevents 
universities from hiding informa-
tion from the public that members of 
the community should be entitled to 
know.
After reviewing Carnegie Mellon’s 
2015 Sexual Assault and Relation-
ship Violence Study, it is clear that 
college campuses across America are 
facing a sexual assault epidemic. Out 
of those surveyed, 38.3% of under-
graduate females at Carnegie Mellon 
University reported experiencing an 
attempted sexual assault. Even more 
frightening is the fact that 26% of 
them have actually experienced 
a completed sexual assault. Ac-
cording to Carnegie Mellon, 
this ?nding is no outlier and 
is “similar to what has been 
reported in the media for 
undergraduate women.”
Despite large num-
bers, “less than ?ve per-
cent of each type of at-
tempted or completed 
sexual assault type is 
reported to [Carnegie 
Mellon].” 23.3% of 
unreported cases 
were not reported 
because the vic-
tim did not believe 
Carnegie Mellon 
had the authority to 
handle such cases, 
and 9.8% of cases 
were not reported 
because the person 
did not know how to 
do so. Clearly, there 
are places where 
Carnegie Mellon can 
work to improve, but 
the lack of transpar-
ency caused by FERPA 
is counterproductive to 
making students aware 
of the dangers present in 
their community and pre-
vents things that could be 
productive to the communi-
ty, such as the proposed sexual 
assault crime alert, from being 
materialized.
As a witness who went through 
the paperwork and non-disclosure 
agreements of a Title IX case, I can 
say with certainty that this is an is-
sue of national policy. Whether with 
good intentions to comply with the 
law or bad intentions to shield their 
own ?aws, the various interpreta-
tions of FERPA have caused univer-
sities to bar information on cases of 
sexual assault that are crucial to pro-
tecting the community. Why should a 
rape committed by a college football 
star be made any less public than one 
committed by any other rapist on the 
street? Cases like these should be 
handled with the same consequenc-
es, rigor, and transparency as ones 
outside of the university, and FERPA 
must be rewritten in a way that war-
rants universities to do so.

Airline electronics ban is about discrimination, not security
Lahren’s ?ring re?ects intolerance
MADELINE KIM
Even before Donald Trump of-
?cially became the 45th President, 
he had shaken up America with 
his list of things he wanted to com-
plete within his ?rst hundred days 
in of?ce. One critical task on his 
agenda was to repeal and replace 
Obamacare. The original plan was 
to replace the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act (ACA), 
commonly known as Obamacare, 
with the American Health Care Act 
(AHCA). Despite the handful of 
executive orders and promises he 
has made in the ?rst months of his 
presidency, he has found himself 
tangled in healthcare and expressed 
this debacle when he said “nobody 
knew health care could be so com-
plicated.”
It is not news that the ACA, or 
healthcare in general, is compli-
cated or misconstrued in one way 
or another. Although Trump had 
consistently condemned Obamacare 
over the years, he has also consis-
tently praised universal coverage. 
Despite Obamacare being a failure, 
“everybody’s got to be covered” and 
“the government’s gonna pay for it.” 
Perhaps the part Trump so greatly 
detests about the ACA is the collo-
quial name — Obamacare.
This is where the AHCA comes 
into play.
The AHCA planned to eliminate 
the funding of the Prevention and 
Public Health Fund and instead in-
vest more in the funding for commu-
nity health centers. Ultimately, this 
could jeopardize services such as 
the Planned Parenthood Federation 
of America. Healthcare would be-
come even more inaccessible. Cur-
rently, Congress estimates 22 mil-
lion people today bene?t from the 
ACA; if the ACA were to be repealed 
and replaced with the AHCA, ap-
proximately 30 million people in 
America would go without health 
insurance.
This is not the ?rst time that 
Trump’s desires have contradicted 
those of traditional conservative 
values. He has proposed regula-
tions to trade and potentially placed 
the First Amendment in jeopardy. 
Perhaps the repeal and replacement 
of the ACA divided the White House 
more than Trump’s other controver-
sial stances.
Opponents of the AHCA were not 
and are not exclusively Democrats; 
many Republicans had shown criti-
cism of the plan to “repeal and re-
place” Obamacare. The bill required 
a simple majority of 216 votes, 
meaning no more than 21 Republi-
cans could vote against if the Ameri-
can Health Care Act (AHCA) were 
to be passed. 33 Republicans explic-
itly showed their discontent with the 
AHCA by voting no; 45 were unde-
cided or otherwise ambiguous; nine 
expressed concerns or were leaning 
towards voting no.
Furthermore, conservatives in 
the House were not alone in stand-
ing up against the AHCA. The 
Koch brothers, the nation’s second 
wealthiest family widely known for 
their monetary political contribu-
tions, especially in the 2016 presi-
dential election, showed their great 
discontent with Trump’s plan to 
combat the ACA by giving monetary 
incentive to Republicans oppos-
ing the bill. The Freedom Partners, 
a nonpro?t conservative news 
source partially funded by the Koch 
brothers, denounced the AHCA as 
“Obamacare 2.0”.
There is a myriad of reasons 
many conservatives went against 
this bill. Some Republicans had 
echoed similar sentiments as the 
Freedom Partners. Representatives 
such as Rep. Thomas Massie (R–KY) 
and Rep. Mo Brooks (R–AL) did not 
?nd the AHCA to truly kick out the 
ACA. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler 
(R–WA) did not see the AHCA low-
ering premiums, taxes, or expenses.
With all the division it has 
caused, the ACA has yet to be re-
placed, and Speaker of the House 
Paul Ryan stated that “we’re going 
to be living with Obamacare for the 
foreseeable future.” However, peo-
ple bene?ting from the ACA cannot 
get too complacent just yet. Ryan is 
still determined to repeal the ACA, 
Republicans are trying to compro-
mise to create a replacement for 
the ACA they can all agree on, and 
Trump still has that list of items he 
wishes to cross off his agenda. As far 
as how the replacement for the ACA 
pans out has yet to be determined.

In an age in which political issues 
are reduced to gossip fodder, it is 
hardly a surprise that Tomi Lahren’s 
?ring from the conservative news 
network The Blaze has captivated 
the eager fascination of American 
political consumerism as though 
it were a celebrity pregnancy or 
breakup.
For those “special snow?akes” 
who haven’t been caught up on the 
drama surrounding the conserva-
tive right’s sweetheart, Tomi Lahren 
is a bitingly sarcastic, fast-talking, 
spit?re political commentator who 
routinely attacks liberal stances on 
the many controversial issues that 
plague our nation today. Or at least 
she did, until this past month, when 
her pro-choice comments earned her 
an abrupt dismissal from The Blaze.
Like unwilling viewers of a dread-
ful reality show, Americans reacted 
with a plethora of vehement opin-
ions, from betrayed conservative 
anger to liberal disgust for her hy-
pocrisy to reluctant sympathy from 
pro-choice supporters.
The true issue at con?ict here, 
however, is not about Tomi Lahren, 
The Blaze, or even the abortion de-
bate — it is about the fatally divisive 
hypocrisy that af?icts both ends of 
America’s political spectrum.
In one of her many irate, incendi-
ary rants, Lahren criticized the po-
litical left for “preach[ing] tolerance 
and understanding, but only for 
those people and issues they believe 
in.” This type of opinion statement 
won Lahern widespread approval 
among conservatives. How ironic, 
then, that when she gives an opin-
ion that her bosses don’t agree with, 
all her opinions are subsequently 
silenced.
Vilifying the opposition for their 
commitment to fundamental beliefs, 
while refusing to budge from your 
own principles, is hypocritical and 
detrimental to this already sickly 
political climate. Invalidating every 
opposing argument by citing it as in-
tolerant is also fatal to the function 
of a democracy such as ours, the 
advancement of which depends 
upon con?icting viewpoints and 
compromise.
The Blaze is a network that ca-
ters to a very conservative audience; 
it is unsurprising that they would 
?re even their most powerful, recog-
nized speaker for her rejection of a 
value so sacred, so inviolable to most 
conservatives. However, Lahren is 
also a nationally recognized pundit, 
and her dismissal makes an enor-
mous statement regarding the image 
that The Blaze, as a representative of 
conservative views, projects to the 
world — complete rejection of any 
alternate belief. In the spirit of its 
own professed tolerance, The Blaze 
should have retained Lahren as a 
commentator whose beliefs are not 
wholly restricted by political party, 
thus forcing honest discussion and 
respectful, open-minded debate.
The dif?culty with tolerance, 
though, is that people are only tol-
erant until a fundamental principle 
is challenged — when something is 
no longer a mere opinion, but an in-
violable belief, such as racial equal-
ity or the sacredness of life. In fact, 
this sort of belief-level intolerance 
is essential to one’s moral character, 
and has historically been the fuel 
that keeps morality alive in this 
country. Intolerance of ra-
cial discrimination forced 
the passage of the 
landmark Civil Rights 
legislation in the 1960s and drove 
thousands of Americans to protest 
in Black Lives Matter protests, just 
as intolerance of bigotry inspired the 
Women’s March in Washington.
It is a very narrow path, there-
fore, that Americans are now forced 
to walk in this new political wil-
derness. One must tolerate others’ 
rights to hold their own beliefs, with-
out wavering in the defense of one’s 
own principles. The Blaze, therefore, 
should have kept Tomi Lahren with-
out sacri?cing its own pro-life val-
ues, but rather respecting her right 
to hold an independent belief. Per-
haps this, coupled with other groups’ 
efforts to tolerate and defend, would 
raise the standard in politics from re-
jection and repetition to actual con-
versation. It is the only way to escape 
the unproductive political rut that 
we’re stuck in now.

Last week, I called my mother who 
lives in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 
to speak to her about the electronics 
travel ban. The ban had been imple-
mented by the U.S. government and 
restricts electronic devices larger 
than a smart phone on non-stop 
?ights from 10 airports across eight 
Muslim-majority countries to the 
United States. When I told her about 
the ban, her response was, “well, 
you’re ?ying Emirates, so you 
can manage without your 
laptop for a couple 
of hours, right? You can’t possibly be 
that bored without your laptop.”
The electronics ban — to many 
people that I’ve tried to engage 
in this conversation with, includ-
ing my mother — seems like a 
minor inconvenience. It seems 
to them something that is neces-
sary to adhere to because “one can 
surely give up their laptop for a few 
hours for increased security.” Howev-
er, to me it isn’t about the ban itself. 
It isn’t about the ‘inconvenience’ that 
passengers will face and it de?nitely 
isn’t about how to spend 20 hours on 
a plane. It’s about the mindset that 
implemented the ban — what the 
ban is supposed to do. It is the 
(perhaps subtle?) discrimina-
tory undertones of the ban 
that I won’t be able to for-
get when I pack my bags in 
Dubai to come back to the 
U.S., thinking about the 
country that I will be re-
turning to that hurt me 
on a personal level.
“We have rea-
son to be concerned 
about attempts by 
terrorist groups to 
circumvent avia-
tion security and 
terrorist groups 
continue to target aviation interests,” 
U.S. of?cials said in a statement to Al 
Jazeera, a Doha-based news broad-
caster. In my opinion, these possible 
“attempts by terrorist groups” are not 
reason enough to justify an on-board 
electronics ban. The question here 
is, what makes these Middle-Eastern 
and North-African countries more 
susceptible to potential terrorist ac-
tivities? Many airports in the banned 
list have very stringent security mea-
sures and Abu Dhabi International 
Airport even has passengers pass 
through a pre-check approved by 
the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security. Sure, some news agen-
cies report that the ban is in place 
because of an incident on a Somali 
plane in February of 2016 or because 
of intelligence reports on Al Qaeda 
in the Arabian Peninsula which has 
increased activity targeting aircrafts. 
The fact still stands that it is hurtful 
to target only very speci?c countries 
based on their religious preferences, 
without a clear, nuanced reason that 
explains the ban, if it is that neces-
sary to keep it in place.
The lack of a speci?c 
reason not only 
shows on 
the lack of thought process that went 
in implementing the ban, but also 
seems to be just a placebo to soothe 
those concerned by “terrorists from 
Muslim countries,” considering that 
the ban doesn’t affect carriers from 
airports like Paris and Brussels that 
have only recently been hit by devas-
tating terrorist attacks. In that case, 
the fact that a placebo security mea-
sure had to be used, instead of an ac-
tual statement, is all the more alarm-
ing regarding the competence of the 
government in making the public 
trust it. Even if they do have infor-
mation regarding threats to security, 
the security measures that they have 
put in place, i.e., the electronics ban, 
are by no means an effective way to 
stop a determined malicious attack 
— especially given that the possible 
electronic threat is still on board, if 
not in the passenger deck, then still 
in the cargo hold. Furthermore, this 
also compromises passengers’ poten-
tially sensitive data since checked-in 
luggage is a liability, prone to theft, 
damage and loss.
An article in the Washington Post 
claims that these measures are to 
ensure the weakening of the U.S.-
based airlines’ competitors, which of-
ten receive subsidies from the states 
that they are based in; for example, 
Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar 
Airways. Should that be the reason, 
then the ban and the statements ac-
companying the ban are hypocritical 
and misleading. National security is 
not an excuse that should be used for 
an ulterior motive by any trustworthy 
and self-respecting government.
Again, the problem to me is not 
that much of an inconvenience. I 
would now have to either check my 
laptop in, or take a ?ight to the U.S. 
via Europe. It scares me that I feel un-
safe in the place I come from because 
of all the conditioning that I have 
subconsciously absorbed in the U.S., 
and that I feel unsafe in the U.S. be-
cause of the place that I come from. 
But, it still hurts that I have to think 
about my identity, about the speci?c 
country that I come from every single 
time I have to step into the U.S.

Assistant SciTech Editor
Hae Young Noh, a 
Carnegie Mellon civil and 
environmental engineering 
assistant professor, recently 
won the NSF CAREER 
Grant for her research on 
“Structures as Sensors.” 
Her research uses small 
cylindrical sensors located 
at strategic positions to mea-
sure vibrations generated 
by human activity, then 
extrapolates information 
about their quality of life.
She states that each 
person’s gait is distinct 
enough to be used as 
identi?ers. “Each step,” she 
explains, “is like a mini earth-
quake with its own epicenter.” 
The gait of a person can be 
characterized by various 
parameters such as balance, 
stability, strength, and speed. 
The vibrations created by 
steps hold more information 
such as location, identity, 
level of activity, health status, 
and even mood. Although she 
is still ?ne-tuning the data 
related to mood, Noh argues 
that mood is very certainly 
re?ected in one’s gait. “A 
depressed person walks very 
differently from one that 
isn’t,” she remarked.
Vibrations are also 
generated by machines and 
other household objects. 
For example, when some-
one turns on a tap, the water 
running through the pipes 
generates a characteristic 
vibration. Thus, these sensors 
receive a lot of information 
about many different actions 
occurring within a build-
ing. Processing this data is, 
in Noh’s opinion, one of the 
most challenging aspects of 
the project. She said, “The 
challenge lies in the data anal-
ysis and the signal processing. 
It is a very convoluted signal, 
giving us information about 
people, about structures and 
about the environment. Now 
that we have all this data, 
how do we take what we 
want? That is something I’m 
working on.”
Noh explained that, at 
a very basic level, the data 
works like an identi?cation 
match. One can look for a 
“gait match” in a database, 
and if the match doesn’t 
exist then the person is 
unauthorized in the build-
ing. This has several different 
targeted applications such as 
security. Another application 
would be in the retail 
industry where it could be 
used for customer behavior 
analysis. Furthermore, it 
could give information about 
road traf?c and the climate. 
Another application for this 
technology would be to get 
data about various structures. 
For instance, when installed 
in railway structures it could 
be used to get data about 
the faults in the tracks as the 
vibrations change.
This technology has 
been developed keeping 
the speci?c needs of nurs-
ing homes for the elderly in 
mind. Noh works with the 
Vincentian Nursing Home 
and the Baptist Nursing 
Homes in Pittsburgh, so she 
explained, “there is some-
one whose gait suggests that 
the quality of their walk is 
deteriorating and they should 
probably slow down and take 
rest. In that case, the system 
would alert a caretaker who 
could handle the situation. 
Thus, the person in question 
doesn’t have to completely 
be con?ned to a wheelchair 
to prevent falls in case there 
aren’t enough caretakers to 
shadow them all the time.”
Noh’s research is 
particularly advantageous 
because of its noninvasive 
nature. Cameras and 
microphones record very 
personal and sensitive data 
by nature, which causes 
several people to reject them 
as a method of information 
gathering. Secondly, 
wearables such as smart-
watches require people to 
place a device on themselves, 
which could be seen as an 
effort on the wearers’ part. 
Noh re?ects that this sensing 
system requires minimum 
interaction from the users 
with the system itself. Regard-
ing this project, Noh predicts 
that the commercialization 
of this technology would 
take ?ve to six years, and 
the technology for advanced 
mood-based and medical 
analysis would take a little 
longer.
Noh said, “It is such a 
convenient way of discover-
ing so much. It is seemingly 
impossible in the beginning, 
when one sees all the 
information and the noise 
stored in one signal. But, 
then it all comes together 
and makes so much sense.” 
While re?ecting on this 
technology in improving 
quality of life, Noh explained, 
“this research has so much 
of a human-aspect to it. It is 
very rewarding to work with 
people in such a tangible and 
direct manner.”
Vibration sensors used to collect structural information
Mathematical theorem detects gerrymandering in districts
EMMA FLICKINGER
Staffwriter
A team of researchers from 
the University of Pittsburgh 
(Pitt) and Carnegie Mellon 
used a new mathematical 
theorem to show that 
Pennsylvania’s congressional 
districts are gerrymandered.
Gerrymandering was 
described by President 
Obama in his 2016 State of the 
Union address as when “poli-
ticians pick their voters, and 
not the other way around.” 
It is the biased process of re-
drawing political districts to 
ensure that one party gets a 
majority of votes, and it is of-
ten used by the majority party 
in state legislatures to ensure 
re-election.
Two Carnegie Mellon 
researchers Alan Frieze, 
professor of mathematical 
sciences, and Wesley Pegden, 
assistant professor of 
mathematical sciences, 
worked with Maria Chikina 
of Pitt. They proved a new 
mathematical theorem that 
determines whether a given 
sample is nonrandom, and 
therefore biased. 
The theorem depends on 
Markov chains, algorithms 
that can be used to develop 
models of randomness. A 
Markov chain begins with 
a ?xed object and evolves 
it through a step-by-step 
process, making small, 
random changes to the object 
at each step. Markov chains 
are frequently used to model 
random processes in ?elds 
like thermodynamics, statis-
tics, and genetics. They also 
form the basis of Google’s al-
gorithm for ordering search 
results.
The researchers ap-
plied their Markov chain 
research to Pennsylvania’s 
congressional districts. If 
the congressional districts 
were unbiased, they would 
resemble the map produced 
by the algorithm. This pro-
cess was not intended to cre-
ate optimal districting, but to 
provide a reliable test for bias 
within the current districts. 
To ensure accurate results, 
the researchers gave their 
algorithm constraints that 
congressional redistricting 
should ideally abide by 
— each district must be 
contiguous, contain roughly 
the same number of people 
and maintain a reasonable ra-
tio of perimeter to area. 
In each step of the al-
gorithm, one precinct was 
chosen at random to be 
changed over to anoth-
er district, as long as the 
change would still adhere 
to the imposed constraints. 
Starting with the current 
congressional district map, 
the researchers applied the 
algorithm for over a trillion 
steps.
The map randomly 
generated by the algorithm 
was signi?cantly different 
from the real map. “There is 
no way that this map could 
have been produced by an 
unbiased process,” Pegden 
said of the current districts.
These results con?rm 
mathematically what 
political scientists have 
been arguing for years — 
districting has become a 
biased system allowing those 
in power to remain in power. 
Though gerrymandering is 
present in almost all states, 
Pennsylvania has been one 
of the worst offenders since 
its last redistricting in 2010; 
the state’s seventh district 
appeared on the Washington 
Post’s list of the country’s 
top ten most gerrymandered 
congressional districts. 
Gerrymandering has caused 
drastic bias in Pennsylvania’s 
state legislature. 
The Democratic and 
Republican parties both 
received close to 50 per-
cent of votes in the 2012 
and 2014 elections, but the 
gerrymandered districts 
(decided by a Republican 
state legislature) gave 72 
percent of Pennsylvania’s 
congressional seats to 
Republicans.
Efforts to reform 
congressional districting are 
usually faced with partisan 
groups working to maintain 
or increase the impact of 
gerrymandering. Analysis and 
investigation like the research 
above constitute an important 
component of the ?ght for 
honesty in state legislature. 
Former California governor 
Arnold Shwazenegger 
started a campaign against 
gerrymandering. 
The research was 
published online in February 
in the Proceedings of 
the National Academy of 
Sciences.
Samsung announces the new, sleek S8
After a year riddled with 
exploding S7 phones and 
horrendous public relations, 
Samsung has announced its 
next phone — the S8 and the 
S8+. Samsung hopes the new 
phone will restore customer 
trust and boost their sales and 
stock prices. The technology 
giant has ensured that this 
phone does not catch ?re like 
its predecessor. The phone 
will be released on April 21, 
2017 and starts at $720.
The S8 comes with a ?nger-
print sensor, an AI assistant, 
and an iris recognition security 
feature. The display screen 
is incredibly large, boasting 
a 18.5:9 ratio with curved 
edges. However, many aspects 
of the S8, including battery 
life, camera quality, and RAM 
are not signi?cantly different 
from the S7. The S8 thus seems 
more like a revamped S7 than 
an entirely new release.
Samsung’s new attempt is 
sleek, safe, and equipped with 
an amazing display. Although 
many customers turned away 
from Samsung, the S8 could  
turn things around.

NASA switched off one of its satellites
Earth Observing-1 (EO-1), 
one of NASA’s most enduring 
satellites, has been switched 
off. It was originally built to 
last a year and launched more 
as a test, but surpassed every-
one’s expectations, operating 
functionally for 17 years. 
EO-1 observed dozens of 
natural disasters as well as 
changes to the Earth’s surface 
and atmosphere. It contributed 
to NASA’s understanding of 
satellite formation ?ight and 
AI technology with respect to 
space observation.
The veteran satellite was 
switched off due to a lack of 
enough fuel to operate it. It 
is impossible to refuel the 
satellite because of the nature 
of its orbit, which is very low. 
Other satellites like the Hubble 
telescope are periodically 
serviced to ensure they remain 
at the correct altitude and 
continue to function. The fuel 
onboard the satellite is used 
to power motors for adjusting 
attitude.
EO-1 will orbit in a dead 
state for 40 more years, until 
it burns up in the atmosphere.

SpaceX landed a used Falcon rocket
SpaceX has made history 
by landing a rocket it sent 
into space. The Falcon 9 
rocket took off from Cape 
Canaveral in Florida, placing 
a communications satellite in 
orbit. The Falcon later landed 
on a SpaceX drone ship in 
the Atlantic Ocean. Although 
SpaceX has landed rockets 
before, this is the ?rst time 
in history a space rocket has 
launched for the second time.
Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, 
commented on the feat. “It 
means you can ?y and re-?y 
an orbital class booster, which 
is the most expensive part of 
the rocket. This is going to be, 
ultimately, a huge revolution 
in space?ight,” he said. The 
conventional rocket disposes 
of the orbital booster once it 
has escaped the atmosphere, 
leaving it to burn on re-entry.
The cost of space ?ight 
could be greatly diminished 
if SpaceX achieves this feat 
regularly. Space ?ight is now 
similar to other means of 
transport, in which the vehicle 
is not disposed of at the 
destination.

New research ?nds that people create their own realities
JOSH ANDAH
SciTech Editor
A study by Carnegie Mellon 
researchers has shown what 
many presumed: we forge 
our own realities. George 
Loewenstein, professor of 
economics and psychology, 
Russel Golman, assistant 
professor of social and 
decision sciences, and David 
Hagmann, a Ph.D. candidate 
in the Department of So-
cial and Decision Sciences, 
published their work in 
the Journal of Economic 
Literature. The study showed 
that people avoid information 
that disagrees with their 
world view, but accept 
information that supports it.
People even interpret 
contradictory information 
in ways that support their 
views. For example, many 
considered the U.S. Congress’ 
acquittal of Hillary Clinton for 
a use of a private email server 
as evidence that Congress is 
corrupt.
“People 
often avoid 
information 
that could help 
them to make 
better decisions 
if they think 
the information 
might be painful 
to receive.”
- George Loewenstein,
Professor of 
Economics and 
Psychology
Information avoidance 
can be detrimental. It can 
manifest as a reason why 
people do not go for medical 
screenings, why they reject 
scienti?c information, or 
why they accept unfound-
ed facts. The inability to 
address contradicting views 
leads to poor decision-
making, which is why 
economists are interested in 
researching it. Loewenstein 
elaborated, saying, “People 
often avoid information that 
could help them to make 
better decisions if they think 
the information might be 
painful to receive.”
The study suggests that 
people create their own 
realities to live the way they 
wish. 
“Those who do not take a 
genetic test can enjoy their 
life until their illness can’t be 
ignored, an in?ated sense of 
our own abilities can help us 
to pursue big and worthwhile 
goals, and not looking at our 
?nancial investments when 
markets are down may keep 
us from selling in a panic,” 
said Golman on people’s 
motivations.
Advertisers take advantage 
of this by making people think 
they are happy, especially as a 
result of a speci?c product.
Two of the most infamous 
examples of information 
denial in science are the 
rejection of climate change 
and the acceptance of a 
relationship between vaccines 
and autism. While the former 
has been con?rmed time and 
time again, the latter has 
been completely disproved; 
yet, people choose to ignore 
scienti?c fact in favor of their 
own beliefs. 
This affects not only them, 
but the health and security of 
future generations and people 
in their communities.
Creating warped realities 
may be an inherently human 
trait, which would have wide 
implications. We may do it to 
avoid stress.
A possible solution to 
information avoidance 
trend is less clear. It is up 
to individuals to challenge 
their beliefs, an action that 
exercises a lazy mind and 
is regular among the best 
decision makers.Simin Li/Art Editor
HOW THINGS WORK
JOSH ANDAH
SciTech Editor
Cosmologists have known 
for almost a century that our 
universe isn’t static. In 1919, 
Edwin Hubble gazed up at the 
universe through his power-
ful telescope and made two 
ground-breaking observa-
tions: there exist galaxies 
outside our own, and those 
galaxies are ?ying away from 
us. 
It is the second observation 
that revealed the true, ex-
panding nature of our uni-
verse.
Hubble arrived at this 
realization after he witnessed 
a strange phenomenon — 
all distant galaxies are red-
shifted. 
A red-shift occurs when 
an object is traveling away 
from an observer at speeds 
comparable to the speed of 
light. 
To the observer, it seems 
as though light waves emitted 
from the object are stretched 
out, increasing their wave-
length. 
This makes the object ap-
pear red (red light has the 
longest wavelength). Hubble 
also noticed that the red-
shift effect was stronger the 
further out he looked.
In every direction scientists 
looked, they saw galaxies 
zooming away from the Earth 
and one another. Naturally, 
theoretical physicists like 
Stephen Hawking wondered 
what would happen if we ran 
the clock backwards. 
The galaxies would come 
closer together! In fact, if we 
go back far enough in time, all 
the galaxies would be at the 
same point in space. 
This large amount of 
mass at a single point cre-
ates something called singu-
larity, a point in space with 
so much mass and gravity 
that it distorts space tremen-
dously. When all the mass in 
the universe is compressed 
at a point, the resulting 
singularity wraps all space in 
on itself.
This is how the big bang 
theory was developed. At the 
beginning of the universe, 
13 billion years ago, all 
matter was at a single point, 
then began to expand apart. 
Scientists are still unsure 
of what initially caused the 
expansion, however. The 
cosmic background radiation 
gives them a glimpse into the 
early universe.
Today, the universe is 
still expanding and at an 
accelerating rate. Space 
expands at 74 kilometers 
per second per megaparsec 
(one megaparsec is about 
three million light years). It 
is important to note that this 
expansion only occurs at large 
scales, such as in the space 
between galaxies; it cannot be 
observed here on Earth.
Understanding the nature 
of the universe’s expansion 
informs us about the future 
fate of our universe. 
If the rate of expansion 
continues to accelerate, 
galaxies will continue to ?y 
apart at such a high velocity 
that their light will not be able 
to reach us anymore, never to 
be seen again. When the stars 
in our galaxy die, the night-
time sky will be completely 
dark. This is know as the big 
freeze. 
Another possibility is 
that there is just enough 
mass in the universe 
to halt the expansion.  
The universe will simply 
remain in a stationary state, 
neither expanding nor 
contracting. 
The ?nal probability is 
that the mass in the universe 
is just enough to reverse 
expansion. The universe will 
begin to contract, eventually 
returning it to its singularity 
state. This is known as the 
big crunch. Such a universe 
oscillates between states of 
singularity and expansion for 
eternity.
All our current data 
suggests that the big freeze 
is the most likely future, 
because there simply isn’t 
enough mass in our universe 
to slow down its accelerating 
expansion. 
As sad as this  seems, it’s 
very, very far in the future. For 
dozens of billions of years, we 
can still enjoy the view of our 
neighboring galaxies — that 
is, if we’re still around.
The expansion of the universe is steadily accelerating

Galaxies in clusters are held together by strong gravitational forces, so they do not ?y apart from one another as the universe gradually expands.

NFL Free Agency: Big money for questions and concerns
IAN TANAYA
Sports Editor
As April begins, the NFL’s 
free agency period, which 
started at the beginning of the 
new league year on Thursday, 
March 9, has long since blown 
past the frenzy that sees es-
tablished players negotiate 
new contracts for either new 
teams or their old one. The 
period is built on the premise 
that teams can potentially ?nd 
a centerpiece in establishing 
a new identity or acquire the 
last piece of the puzzle for a 
Super Bowl run.
While free agency has more 
often than not ended up let-
ting down the lofty aspirations 
teams and their fan bases have, 
huge signings like the Green 
Bay Packers’ 1993 acquisi-
tion of defensive end Reggie 
White, the New Orleans 
Saints’ 2006 decision to bring 
on quarterback Drew Brees, 
and the Denver Broncos’ 2012 
victory in the bidding for quar-
terback Peyton Manning have 
been able to effect substantial 
changes for the teams that 
best utilize the opportunity for 
growth.
With the frenzy of the ?rst 
days and weeks now in the 
rear view mirror, it’s time to 
see what acquisitions ahead of 
the annual draft may help or 
hurt their teams in the upcom-
ing year.
Carolina Panthers sign OT 
Matt Kalil
Drafted fourth overall 
by the Minnesota Vikings in 
2012, offensive tackle Matt 
Kalil was expected to be a solid 
force on the team’s offensive 
line. During his rookie year, 
it sure seemed like that would 
be the case, as Kalil earned his 
way to the Pro Bowl that year.
Unfortunately for the Vi-
kings, his play has become 
inconsistent in recent years, 
and an injury that forced him 
to undergo season-ending sur-
gery last September gave the 
team an easy reason to let him 
walk.
Despite the downward 
trend of Kalil’s performance, 
the Carolina Panthers de-
cided to pay him big, offering 
a 5-year, $55.5 million deal. 
Certainly, the Panthers are in 
need of help.
A year removed from tak-
ing on the Broncos in Super 
Bowl 50, the Panthers went 
6–10 in 2016, and quarter-
back Cam Newton certainly 
regressed, throwing 16 fewer 
touchdowns and four more 
interceptions compared to the 
prior year.
“He’s going to have to re-
build his con?dence. I mean, 
he was shook. Let’s be honest. 
I’m not going to lie about that,” 
Panthers head coach Ron 
Rivera said. “The young man 
went through a tough time, 
and we went through a tough 
time. [The struggles go] back 
to ‘you’ve got to protect your 
quarterback and put playmak-
ers around him.’ We’ve got to 
do that. I’d like to believe that 
we’re doing those things right 
now that we need to do in the 
offseason.”
While many commenta-
tors questioned giving Kalil a 
payday that puts him among 
the highest paid offensive 
tackles in the league, it is en-
tirely possible that Kalil can ?t 
in the Panthers’ scheme and 
provide the shoring up for a 
solid offensive line that can 
give Newton better protection. 
After all, Panthers center Ryan 
Kalil has certainly performed 
at a high level for the team. 
Good chemistry could work 
wonders for the Panthers 
looking to turn things around. 
Cleveland Browns sign G Kev-
in Zeitler
Oh, Cleveland. You’re so 
laughably terrible that your 
actual team left your city in 
1996, became the Baltimore 
Ravens, and went on to earn 
two Super Bowl victories. 
That certainly doesn’t stop the 
NFL and the Browns’ fanbase 
from pretending that the team 
merely suspended operations 
for a few years before return-
ing to compete in 1999. With 
only two winning seasons in 
2002 and 2007, the current 
Cleveland Browns are in as 
laughably terrible a position 
as they have been for most of 
the past 18 years. Still, if the 
0–16 Detroit Lions of 2008 
managed to turn themselves 
into a mildly respectable foot-
ball team, it stands to reason 
that the Browns might one day 
be able to do the same.
Known for having 26 dif-
ferent starting quarterbacks 
in the past 18 seasons, stabil-
ity at the position is something 
the current Browns have never 
had. With no true star wait-
ing to take the reins, it is clear 
that the Browns need a differ-
ent foundation in their efforts 
to become relevant. In a year 
where offensive tackles seem 
to be high in demand without 
many top options perceived in 
the draft, former Cincinnati 
Bengals guard Kevin Zeitler 
took home a 5-year, $60 mil-
lion contract that puts him 
at the highest paid guard in 
NFL history. While the con-
tract is rich for a player con-
sidered good but not the best, 
it seems like whoever steps 
into Cleveland’s quarterback 
situation will ?nd themselves 
with a more than adequate 
offensive line. It just might be 
something that ?nally helps 
the Browns climb out of the 
AFC North cellar. Or not.
Jacksonville Jaguars sign 
CB A.J. Bouye, DE Calais 
Campbell, S Barry Church
While certainly not 
Browns/2008 Lions levels 
of terrible, the Jacksonville 
Jaguars have struggled to 
compete in recent years. 
Quarterback Blake Bortles has 
shown signs of potential bril-
liance, but the team ended up 
3–13 last year.
The Jaguars seemed to em-
phasize defense this free agen-
cy period, snatching up former 
Houston Texans cornerback 
A.J. Bouye, former Arizona 
Cardinals defensive end Calais 
Campbell, and former Dallas 
Cowboys safety Barry Church. 
Campbell’s 4-year, $60 million 
contract may be high for a 31-
year old, but pass rushers have 
been known to get plenty high-
er, as evidenced by the 4-year 
$62 million contract the New 
York Giants gave to defensive 
end Jason Pierre-Paul, whose 
performance has fallen off 
since a 2015 ?reworks in-
jury. Combined with Bouye 
and Church, the Jaguars look 
poised to challenge a weak 
AFC South.
Chicago Bears sign QB Mike 
Glennon
With quarterback Jay 
Cutler released and now en-
joying his time off perhaps 
a bit too much, the Chicago 
Bears need to look for their fu-
ture quarterback.
Former Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers quarterback Mike 
Glennon is not likely to be 
that guy. Though his 3-year 
$45 million deal gives him 
what seems like a high $15 
million a year average, this 
would put him around the 
20-25th highest quarterback 
salaries in 2017. Glennon was 
once thought up as a poten-
tial star in Tampa Bay, but a 
2,608-yard performance with 
19 touchdowns and nine in-
terceptions during his rookie 
season led the team to bring 
in quarterback Josh McCown 
as a competitor before quar-
terback Jameis Winston was 
drafted ?rst overall in the 
2015 NFL Draft.
Glennon’s inconsistency 
cost him his job in Tampa 
Bay, but this may still be re-
demption for him in Chicago. 
Buccaneers head coach Dirk 
Koetter continues to say posi-
tive things about Glennon, 
and Bears head coach John 
Fox certainly believes in him 
enough to hand him the start-
ing role. The talent surround-
ing Glennon in the offensive 
line and the receiving corps is 
questionable, and it certainly 
seems like they will be his un-
doing. Still, it is possible that 
Glennon could resurrect his 
career in the Windy City.

After months of debate, 
the Forbes-Morewood inter-
section has inally switched 
from the iconic “beep-boop” 
sound to Ludacris’ “Move, 
Bitch.” This change is part 
of a nationwide initiative to 
decrease the number of le-
gal adults saying the words 
“beep-boop” out loud.
The choice of song was 
based on multiple factors, 
such as general popular-
ity, the calming quality of 
the singer’s voice, and the 
amount of profanity that can 
be satisfyingly yelled at cars 
who are trying to move when 
the light is clearly red. (You 
know who you are, Debra.)
Falsa Nayme, a irst-
year at Carnegie Mellon, had 
only positive things to say 
about the choice. “When I’m 
sprinting from the entrance 
of Mudge in a desperate and 
ultimately futile attempt to 
get to the street in time, 
Ludacris really inspires me 
to push past obstacles. I 
used to only glare at people 
who were walking too slowly. 
Now I’m inspired to shove 
other students, kick small 
children, and step on the 
prone body of an elderly man 
suffering a heart attack.”
Nayme laughed and con-
tinued, “It’s nice to be able 
to prioritize my selish de-
sires over the well-being of 
others in places other than 
the dorm and classroom. I 
really feel like I’m branching 
out.” 
However, not all re-
sponses are positive; vari-
ous parents have expressed 
concerns that the line stat-
ing anyone moving slowly will 
be “ran the f*** over” will 
result in an increase in ac-
cidents. 
“Maybe,” Bill Peduto, may-
or of Pittsburgh, admitted 
in a press conference last 
week. “But let’s be honest, 
they’re college students. 
Most of them plead to be hit 
by cars daily, so we’re actu-
ally doing them a favor.”
When reached for com-
ment, city oficials said 
they were touched by the 
positive response and will be 
moving forward with their 
plan to replace the orange 
stop hand with one that is 
holding up the middle inger.

Extemely bitter poor 
person
On the afternoon of 
Friday, March 24, my 
roommate Alicia Talbot 
returned from the Cohon 
Center encumbered by a 
large box, reportedly a care 
package from her parents.
Said box was found to 
contain: one king-sized 
Hershey’s milk chocolate 
bar, two one-pound Reese’s 
Peanut Butter Cups, one 
bag of Haribo gummy bears, 
one bag of Sour Patch Kids, 
one bag of Pirate’s Booty, 
four boxes of Star Wars 
shaped Kraft Easy Mac, one 
tin of Grandma’s chocolate 
chip cookies, and an 
assortment of snack-sized 
bags of Frito-Lay products, 
including but not limited to 
Cheetos, SunChips, and two 
lavors of Doritos.
Talbot’s mother also 
included several small but 
useful items, such as pens 
and pencils, chapstick, socks, 
dryer sheets, detergent 
pods, makeup remover 
wipes, and a can opener.
Despite desperate men-
tions of how hungry I am, 
how much I love cookies, 
and how my parents have 
never sent me a care pack-
age, Talbot declined to take 
the hint and offer to share 
anything.
The care package arrived 
less than a week after 
students returned from 
spring break, during which 
time Talbot vacationed with 
her high school friends at 
her parents’ beach home in 
Punta Mita, Mexico. 
It is reported that the 
trip was funded in full by 
Talbot’s parents.
The Instagram posts 
were almost too painful to 
look at. And yet I liked them 
all in an attempt to build up 
her favor, speciically for 
situations like these.
Our suitemate Molly 
Wheeler insightfully noted 
on the matter, “Classic in-
come inequality.”

Feeling nostalgic
I still remember the 
irst night that I stayed 
up past midnight working. 
The library was getting 
emptier, the hum of voices 
had settled down, and my 
stomach was growling loud-
er than it ever had before. 
I was not quite ready to 
start spending my DineX, 
and everything with hot 
meals was closed, except 
for the one place on campus 
I had yet to venture out to 
— Skibo.
Skibo boasted the 
original latbreads that we 
see in Rothberg’s Roasters 
today and milkshakes that 
sang symphonies even for 
the lactose intolerant. The 
fridges with at least 15 
lavors of water and the 
barbecue pizza that just 
could not hold together 
were what made Skibo 
something special.
Seldom am I able to be 
directed towards one soup 
option, with the scheduled 
soups of the day that Skibo 
brought. Options can be 
overwhelming, a sentiment 
that Skibo understood and 
worked to resolve.
Imagine a voice over a 
microphone calling you to 
collect your order, instead 
of the startling vibration 
of a device handed to you. 
When we lost Skibo, we 
lost the human touch that 
comes with the process of 
ordering food.
Let us not forget the 
early-2000s music that 
played on a loop, bringing us 
back to the good old days 
when college was nothing 
more than a distant aspira-
tion. Let us remember the 
days when there were per-
formances held in the deep 
end of the sitting area, and 
we had to check back every 
few minutes to see if our 
food was ready.
I ind it dificult to 
compare any of the to-go 
packaging that we currently 
have on campus to the 
miniature pizza boxes that 
Skibo had to offer. The 
storage capabilities were 
incomparable, and the 
ease of commuting back 
home late at night was 
comforting. 
This extends on to the 
plastic plate covers, that 
preserved the heat of the 
gourmet, triangularly cut 
paninis, so that they were 
nothing short of lukewarm 
at the time of consumption.
Nowadays, I do some-
times get the grumbles late 
at night, and when I walk 
up to the second loor of 
the Cohen Center to scoop 
some soup from Au Bon 
Pain, I catch the Skibo sign 
from the corner of my eye 
and heave a sigh. 
Yes, perhaps Au Bon Pain 
has the variety and the 
branding needed to bring 
joy to our students faces, 
but we’ve lost a bit of our 
campus history. 
I often have to pause 
when I talk to irst-years 
about dining options on 
campus, because Skibo al-
ways lingers at the back of 
my mind. 
The establishment that 
stood in honor of Andrew 
Carnegie’s Scottish castle 
is no more, but the memo-
ries will last forever.

Better than your baby 
mama
Dear open letter writers,
I get it. You have a 
lot of feelings about los-
ing your best friend that 
you thought would be your 
bridesmaid or breaking 
up with the person you 
thought would be your 
life partner at this same 
fantasy wedding, but you 
don’t want to share these 
feelings directly with the 
person they pertain to 
because it’s just a bit too 
personal. 
Or maybe you’re just 
too excited to contain 
your enthusiasm about 
meeting your little and 
having another addition to 
your dysfunctional fam-
ily. Or maybe you even 
overheard someone in the 
library talking about the 
exact same issue you’ve 
had before and realized 
that your fake journal-
ist knowledge needs to be 
shared with the world.
No matter which path 
you’ve taken, you’re here 
now with a letter written 
to someone who might nev-
er read it. 
Sure, it can be thera-
peutic to write and never 
send a letter to someone, 
but you’ve kind of done 
the complete opposite by 
writing an open letter to 
everyone who could ever 
relate to your situation. I 
get that the point of an 
open letter is for others 
with similar experiences to 
know they aren’t alone, but 
I think that message gets 
lost when the letters are 
so speciic that all they’re 
missing is the name.
I know how much all of 
us college students hate 
adulting, but it’s a lot eas-
ier to just be an adult and 
tell your ex-best friend 
to their face how you feel 
than to receive an awk-
ward text a few months 
later about an open letter 
you wrote. On the other 
hand, since it is an open 
letter, there’s no guaran-
tee that the intended au-
dience will realize that the 
letter is meant for them 
and they could go on con-
tinuing to ruin all of their 
future relationships.
Basically, what I’m try-
ing to get at with this open 
letter is please stop writ-
ing these unnecessarily 
long subtweets. We get 
it, you went away to col-
lege, and it didn’t work 
out with your high school 
sweetheart.  I guarantee 
you that one weekend out 
with your friends and not 
stalking their Facebook 
will make you forget ev-
ery thought you wanted 
to write about them in an 
open letter. 
So please just don’t.
Love (not really),
Jade
An open letter to the writers of open letters

Worked really hard on this
After 10 hours of intense 
copy editing, layout design-
ing, last-minute cramming 
and writing, trying to change 
opinions in the forum section, 
and screaming across the 
room because of one errone-
ous use of a semicolon, The 
Tartan staff had inally in-
ished their weekly issue. This 
issue is conveniently labeled 
as “Volume 111, Issue 21” on 
the front page, which gives 
their readers a clear idea of 
how many trees have been 
killed publishing articles that 
nobody has ever read since 
1906.
By noon on Monday, 
April 3, brand new stacks 
of newspapers have been 
dropped off at various 
locations on campus, where 
the newspaper deliveryman 
tried to recycle the previous 
issues on the racks that 
have not been picked up. “I 
literally don’t understand 
why they’re still publishing,” 
Mr. Newspaper Deliveryman, 
a Pittsburgh local newspaper 
delivery man, whined, “The 
stack is literally the same 
height as the last time I saw 
it, which was last Monday 
when I dropped it off.” 
Meanwhile in The Tar-
tan ofice, the copy editors 
are fervently criticizing Mr. 
Deliveryman’s incorrect use 
of “literally”, an issue that, 
frankly, nobody gives two 
s***s about.
In order to increase 
The Tartan’s readership, 
the staff members often 
shamelessly advertise the 
newspaper to their friends 
and force them to read the 
crappy article that they 
wrote on Sunday to ill in the 
space because some lazy-a** 
writer decided not to turn in 
their article. 
Such action has caused 
these people’s friends to 
unfriend them. “I mean, 
my favorite part of the 
newspaper is the ads,” said 
a reader who was forced 
into reading The Tartan by 
her ex-friend, “at least the 
quality is consistent.”
Some readers disagree 
with such criticism. “I think 
The Tartan is a great news-
paper,” said an enthusiast. 
“Although most of the con-
tent is pretty mediocre, I 
love the comics.” But sadly, 
The Tartan staff did not ac-
tually draw the comics them-
selves. They’re usually stolen 
from websites such as xkcd, 
but it’s okay because we cite 
them.
However, the most popu-
lar and common response 
from Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents is the frowning face, 
indicating that they’re very 
confused. “What is The Tar-
tan?” a student asked. “Wait

No, I’m not f****** kid-

times sweetie! XOXO.”
The Tartan publishes yet another issue that students ignore, my mother loves
It can be hard to 
determine which news 
sources are trustworthy. 
With information coming 
from so many outlets (the 
president’s Twitter, your 
mom’s Facebook, your 
roommate’s Snapstory), it 
can be hard to decipher 
what’s real and what’s fake. 
In the era of fake news 
(which let’s be honest is 
a wild enough topic by it-
self), The Tartan has felt 
that it would be necessary 
to inform our readership 
of the credibility of our 
work. We pinky promise 
that we are 100 percent 
legit and in no way are we 
fake news. Any typo that 
has ever been published by 
us was an attempt by loser 
readers to make us look 
bad. Sad, honestly.
If The Tartan were fake 
news, do you really think it 
would be printed? Noth-
ing in print is fake, that’s 
a fact. Just ask The New 
York Times. If we were 
fake news, we’d be entirely 
online. In order to get our 
paper physically printed, 
we have to vow to tell the 
truth, the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth. It’s 
kind of exhausting to take 
this vow every week, but 
we do it because we’re so 
not fake.
Everyone on The Tartan 
staff is perfect in every 
way which is why we don’t 
make any mistakes. We 
have the best copy edi-
tors in the world, and they 
never ever make mistakes. 
If you disagree, you’ll have 
to take it up with our copy 
manager Ruth. You don’t 
want to mess with Ruth.
In just over 110 years, 
The Tartan has not once 
made a mistake. There is 
absolutely no need to fact 
check us on this. What are 
you going to do, go back 
and re-read all of our old 
issues to fact check this 
statement? We’re sur-
prised you’re even reading 
this issue. So I guess you’ll 
just have to take our word 
on this one that we are def-
initely not fake news.

Sigh. Lanyards. The joy 
and bane of a college stu-
dent.
Lanyards are incred-
ibly useful and convenient. 
Your student ID is always 
with you. You don’t have to 
buy a rubber ID holder to 
stick to your phone, ruining 
your wonderfully bedaz-
zled phone case. You don’t 
have to take out your wal-
let and search for your ID 
hiding somewhere behind 
your credit card and all 
the Starbucks gifts cards. 
You’ll always have your ID 
right on you, resting on the 
top of your belly, just beg-
ging to be swiped at Au Bon 
Pain for that sandwich that 
took an eternity to make 
that doesn’t even have the 
avocado you asked for.
But lanyards are ugly. 
Repeat after me: U-G-L-Y. 
And to top it off, you look 
like a dumba**.
Lanyards don’t match 
with anything. Not even 
jeans, the Miracle Outit 
Worker, can make lanyards 
look even remotely decent. 
You look like an idiot, more 
like a nerd than you already 
do (this is Carnegie Mellon, 
of course). They just 
hang there (in non-wind 
situations), at the top of 
your belly, the thick cord a 
hideous neon or a mustard 
beige. The Carnegie 
Mellon store’s selection of 
lanyards is on the better 
side — they’re mostly dark 
colors, or a combination 
of the Cardinal and Gray. 
But tolerable color choices 
cannot negate the fact 
that lanyards are U-G-L-Y.
So, it’s your choice: 
amazing convenience over 
the perfect outit of the 
day. I know what I’m doing!

Lanyards: yes or no?

SHARON WU
Late for class
Last Tuesday, Chip Olé, 
a recent Carnegie Mellon 
alum, TSB ‘16, who enjoys 
hanging around in the Co-
hon Center (CC), created a 
mobile order app for Au Bon 
Pain (ABP), a bakery café 
located in the CC. ABP has 
been notorious for its abil-
ity to make students starve 
to death, or even worse, be 
late for their classes, due 
to the long amount of time 
it takes for their orders to 
get ready.
After what had felt like 
hours from the time he 
placed his order at ABP, 
Olé knew that he and his 
frustrated fellow students 
were ready for a change in 
the system.
“Recently, I’ve been 
enjoying the convenience 
of mobile orders at Star-
bucks,” said Olé, “And with 
the marathon wait at ABP, 
I decided to multi-task and 
use that normally wasted 
time to make a mobile order 
app to address one of our 
school’s most pressing, but 
underrated, issues.”
With only Principles of 
Computing (15-110) under 
his belt, Olé lacked experi-
ence in computer program-
ming, much less the expe-
rience required to make a 
mobile app from scratch. 
However, online resources 
had helped guide Olé in the 
app development process.
“I read a lot of old 
threads on Stack Ex-
change,” said Olé. “I even 
got my former 15-110 TA 
to answer my questions 
— through our old Piazza 
page!”
Olé also consulted the 
advice from many students 
and workers at ABP, which 
created a lot of buzz for 
the app, both on social media 
and in real life. “I really 
have high hopes for this 
new ABP app,” said Miranda 
Jin, a irst-year psychology 
major on her Snapchat 
story. “Once this app gets 
released, I can inally get 
my chipotle turkey and 
avocado sandwich and not 
be ifty minutes late to my 
Introduction to Psychology 
class!”
Once he had made a fully 
functioning app, Olé got in 
contact with Dining Servic-
es, which agreed to release 
an oficial beta version of 
his app in the next coming 
weeks. The project was also 
recognized by the school 
administration, who ap-
plauded Olé as an embodi-
ment of what they envision 
their students to become 
after leaving Carnegie Mel-
lon — world-class innova-
tors with the potential of 
bringing bank to the school.
“From witnessing his 
meritorious talents and pre-
dicting his likely successful 
future,” said an administra-
tor, who insisted on remain-
ing anonymous, “The Board 
of Trustees has made fu-
ture plans to hound  Olé to 
increase Carnegie Mellon’s 
endowment, maybe to a lev-
el comparable to Harvard’s.”
While Olé appreciated 
the “unreal but dope” rec-
ognition for his app, at the 
end of the day, he is just 
an average, humble stu-
dent outside of the com-
puter science department. 
Olé claims he has a strong, 
selless desire to make the 
world around him a better 
place, regardless of his job 
prospects after graduation.
“Now I’m trying to make 
the app more user-friend-
ly,” said Olé. “So I’m work-
ing on incorporating a meme 
generator.” 
At the time of The 
Tartan’s interview with Olé 
on that same Tuesday, one 
of the ABP workers called 
out a long-awaited order 
number.
SYDNEY ROSLIN
White House correspondent
Last Friday, in a shock-
ing turn of events, House 
Speaker Paul Ryan oficially 
pulled his Obamacare repeal 
bill from the loor before it 
had the chance to be put up 
to a vote. While President 
Trump claims that the bill 
was pulled because it didn’t 
have enough promised votes 
to pass a vote on the House 
loor, Speaker Ryan had 
other methods behind his 
actions.
“It’s a classic example of 
reverse psychology,” said 
Ryan, winking. “If we show 
the Democrats that we re-
ally don’t want this repeal 
bill to pass, and I mean that 
we really don’t want this re-
peal bill to pass, then they’ll 
cross party lines and pass 
this bill for us, just to spite 
us.”
Now, in the days following 
the bill’s fallout, Ryan lies in 
wait for the Democrats to 
take the bait.
“Paul Ryan’s been 
acting rather strange 
lately,” reported House 
Minority Leader Nancy 
Pelosi. “Sometimes he just 
walks around the House 
Chamber, whistling. I’m 
surprised he’s able to show 
his face, honestly. If I had 
been responsible for so 
much embarrassment and 
incompetency within my 
own party, I wouldn’t want 
to show my face anywhere 
in America, much less in 
the center of the House 
Chamber.”
“He keeps staring at me 
when the House is in session 
with this smug little smile 
on his face,” said Minority 
Whip Steny Hoyer. 
“It’s as if he expects 
me to suddenly jump 
across party lines and 
support shoddy legislation 
written solely to dismantle 
the work of the Obama 
administration. It’s just 
that vibe, you know? It’s 
kind of creepy.”
When asked how his 
plan was coming along, Ryan 
seemed conident. “They 
don’t know it yet, but those 
Democrats are right where 
I want them, eating out of 
the palm of my hand. Just 
you watch, they’ll pull my 
bill back on the loor and 
pass it before you know it.”
At press time, the 
Democratic party leaders 
were throwing parties 
across the D.C. area, 
celebrating the bill’s 
demise. Paul Ryan was not 
invited.

On the terror of ants
Dear Ruth,
Honestly, dude. I’m so screwed. Two nights ago 
I threw a pretty LIT banger at my house for my 
friend’s 21st surprise birthday party — which, by 
the way, was a huge success. But there was one 
minor mishap. Someone spilled a college student 
classic of Smirnoff and Sprite on my bedroom 
carpet. Yikes, I know. Thankfully, both vodka and 
sprite are clear and didn’t leave a stain on my 
carpet. The real horror is the army of ants that 
swarmed the crime scene that I got to wake up 
to. I frantically jumped out of bed and tried to kill 
them all, and for that day I thought I was safe.
So I went to bed last night, thinking I was in 
the clear and that I had taken the necessary 
precaution to avoid an infestation. So this 
morning, after I got to work and took out my 
laptop, I soon realized that leaving my laptop 
on the ground overnight was the single greatest 
mistake I have made in my entire life to date. Ants 
began crawling out of my laptop in amounts I have 
never before seen. I didn’t know if it would stop. 
I couldn’t use my usual ant killing methods of 
stomping on them because, well, it was my laptop. 
All I could do was shake it violently and hope that 
they’d fall out (please don’t tell the rest of the 
staff that I dumped out an entire extended family 
of ants onto the floor of the office). As the day 
progresses, I find more and more ants on me and 
my belongings — just a moment ago I had to shake 
some ants out of my sleeves. Yuck.
So what do I do? Clearly my home is infested, 
and now I’m pretty sure I’m going to need a new 
backpack. Do those ant traps really work? Should 
I check out one of those weird Pinterest at-home 
remedies for bugs? Please help, before I’m eaten 
alive!
Send help,
Not Okay. Ants Need To Stop
Dear NO ANTS,
Run.
No, seriously, run. Drop out of school, change 
your name, leave the country. Any and all of the 
above. Tell your parents that you love them, your 
roommates that they can have your stuff, and your 
friend who spilled vodka on your floor that you’re 
not mad, just disappointed, and also leaving 
forever and never coming back. This is your life 
now.
It’s not going to be easy. By the time your soon-
to-be short life ends, you will be hardened, 
grizzled, and filled with the weary loneliness that 
can only come from a life on the run. You’ll spend 
everyday thinking fondly of your family, friends, 
and bed until they start to fade from your mind 
like a distant memory. Some days, you’ll wonder 
why you ever ran in the first place, but then you’ll 
remember — ants. And then, you’ll start scratching.
They will always be following you. They will never 
stop. Humanity famously beat out apex predators 
by walking behind them, using our stamina and 
two-legged physique to outlast them. We’re known 
for being the best followers and the best pursuers, 
but that’s all a lie. It was ants the whole time. 
Once they find you, they will never leave you 
alone. They’ll crawl across the world just to crawl 
all over your skin with their creepy, creepy feet.
Every time you feel an itch, you’ll wonder — was 
that them? Are they still on you? Have they caught 
up? (They have. It was always too late. Running 
was a distant hope, but the only one you had left. 
I’m sorry. You deserved better than this.)
Keep running,
Ruth
Zeke Rosenberg | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Acacia
A speakeasy hidden in Southside
After a week of soul searching, I decided it still 
wasn’t too late for Ariel to face retribution for 
her vicious slight against me a few weeks back, 
so this week I headed off to Southside with my 
own replacement. He was in a fancy mood so we 
decided to go to Acacia, a prohibition themed bar 
on East Carson.
The location: The only issue with Southside is that 
the trip can be quite lengthy. The 54 will get you 
there from Craig in about 20 minutes, so it’s not 
the worst thing, but it’s not as easy as some of 
the places in Shadyside and Squirrel Hill if you 
live near campus. Aside from that, Southside is an 
ideal space for a bar, with everything you could 
possibly want in a one block radius. Post-bar grub 
is available ranging from pizza at the Pie Bar to 
cheesesteaks at the Groove. There are other bars 
to hop to if you want to switch up the vibe, and 
there are even necessities such as check cashing 
and tattoos nearby, should that come up.
The drinks: The drinks took a while, and I didn’t 
have a large enough sample to tell if this indicated 
that the bartenders were busy or that they were 
behind the bar working on their sublime mixology. 
I ordered a drink, the Nori by Nature, which I 
can only describe as an alcoholic sushi beverage. 
Basically, it was a mix of seaweed, finger, lime, 
and alcohol. It would take a real food critic 
who knows what words like “saporific” mean 
to break down the drink into words that convey 
such complex flavors. A mere occasional bar 
patron like myself can only offer that it was pretty 
dope… and surprisingly strong. My temporary 
bar buddy ordered La Revuelta, which seemed 
like a misnomer since there wasn’t anything quite 
as revolutionary as seaweed tincture, but it was 
a damned good drink in its own way. The drinks, 
unsurprisingly, are not cheap. A cocktail might run 
you all the way up to $15 after tax and tip, which 
is on the pricey side even for Southside.
The vibe: The speakeasy theme informs the décor. 
To enter Acacia, you walk in through boarded up 
windows and a covered door. This is sort of cool 
aesthetically, but it obscures the step down when 
exiting. Don’t be like me and trip on your way out. 
The interior is dimly lit even for a bar, especially 
since the streetlights can’t flood in. This gives the 
bar a bit of a secret and low-key feel to it that 
makes it a fun place to spend a couple hours.
This bar is not the place to take a bunch of people; 
there just isn’t a ton of space. There is a bar and 
several booths that provide some seating, but it’s 
more of a place to go hang out with a couple 
friends than a group. This is magnified by the fact 
that the bar is fairly quiet compared to others. This 
could just have been that night, but it was very 
easy to sit and have a conversation.
Lit or nah: I’m definitely going to go with lit. This 
certainly isn’t a regular jaunt. It’s too expensive 
for that. However, the series of novel ingredients 
in the drinks and the atmosphere that makes it 
easy to hang out with a few friends make this a fun 
centerpiece for a trip to Southside.

Marika Yang | Assistant Sports Editor
Pittsburgh is a beautiful city, full of history and  
culture — art, technology, sports, and of course, 
food. If I were to use a restaurant to epitomize my 
experience in Pittsburgh and at Carnegie Mellon 
so far, it would be The Yard. It is what I have 
come to expect from the city.
The Yard has three locations: Market Square, PPG 
Paints Arena, and — the one I went to and the one 
closest to campus — Shadyside. Located right off 
Walnut Street on Bellefonte, The Yard is a nice 
walk (or short bus ride) away from campus.
I went to the The Yard on a rainy Sunday night, to 
celebrate a friend’s birthday. It was past 
9 p.m., and since this is Pittsburgh, the restaurant 
was mostly empty. The lower level of the 
restaurant has a larger space, with a nice bar, 
and the upper level, where our party of ten was 
quickly seated, is smaller, but also holds an 
ever-necessary bar. The place has a rustic feel — 
all wood and brick — that allowed us to relax and 
simply enjoy our food.
The Yard is known for its creative grilled cheese 
sandwiches, with names like “The Big  
Che-Bowski,” “Buffy the Mac Attack Slayer,” 
“Hail, Caesar!” and “Mother of Dragons.” The 
menu also includes a requisite salad section, 
with what my friend called a “quality average” 
Caprese salad. The variety of appetizers includes 
soft pretzel, buffalo chicken dip and chips, and 
wings, the latter of which another friend 
commented “left a little to be desired.” The star of 
The Yard’s show, however, are the grilled cheeses.
Each grilled cheese entrée comes with a small 
bowl of tomato soup, and potato chips, which you 
can change to fries, sweet potato fries, or tater 
tots for an extra fee. The wait was short, and soon 
our whole table was desperately trying to hold 
our sandwiches with our hands only to give up 
when everything fell out and resort to using forks.
Because we couldn’t decide what to order for 
ourselves, a friend and I each decided to order 
a different sandwich and then share. I ordered 
“Pierogies N’At,” a cheddar and gouda grilled 
cheese with fried pierogies topped with  
caramelized onions, sauerkraut, and kielbasa. 
The idea of putting pierogies inside a sandwich 
is like Primanti’s putting fries in their sandwiches 
— so very odd, but so very right for Pittsburgh. 
The grilled cheese is rich and tasty, with all the 
flavors complementing each other. The pierogies 
themselves are wonderful, with a thick and chewy 
dough and a smooth and creamy potato filling. 
With my order, I added tater tots with parmesan, 
which were easily the best tater tots I’ve ever had. 
They were fresh and crispy, and went well with 
the standard tomato soup.
My friend ordered the popular “Mac Attack,” 
(which is proudly displayed on the homepage 
of The Yard’s website) a cheddar grilled cheese 
sandwich absolutely stuffed with mac ‘n cheese, 
with a sprinkle of bacon lardons. When it came, 
the mac ‘n cheese was spilling over the bread 
onto the tray, and we had to use our forks to 
eat it. The mac ‘n cheese is great, a level above 
your normal boxed mac ‘n cheese. For her order, 
my friend chose sweet potato fries, which all our 
friends deemed the best side The Yard offers. They 
are delicious, especially with the buttery cinnamon 
dip they come with.
The service was simple and fast, which allowed 
us all to talk and catch up with one another. The 
Yard’s atmosphere is very, for lack of a better 
word, chill. It’s a place a group of friends can 
easily walk into on a whim and enjoy a good 
meal. It is your quintessential Pittsburgh restaurant 
and bar that offers great, unique, quality food.

Iris van Herpen: Transforming Fashion
The artist may be Dutch, but the concept is essentially Pittsburgh
Iris van Herpen: Transforming Fashion, the current fashion exhibit at the 
Carnegie Museum of Art captures themes that are very familiar to us. 
Throughout the city of Pittsburgh, we often encounter sights that combine 
technology with art. The unique culture of the city is what makes Pittsburgh 
one of the best places to display this Dutch designer’s collection. From the 
outfits with textures imitating those of wildlife and natural forces to the ones 
with 3D printed accessories, the ideas in van Herpen’s pieces are those that 
we can easily relate to.
When you first walk into the exhibit, it’ll feel like you’re on a runway, with 
dimmed lighting and models posing on your left and right. All three rooms 
that house the various pieces from fifteen of van Herpen’s collections have 
the same principle setup: mannequin models lined up standing on long white 
platforms, surrounded by dark purple walls for a chic feel. The clothes are 
what add the diversity, fascination, and curiosity to the viewer’s experience.
In the first room, the first selection of van Herpen collections you’ll find 
are “Refinery Smoke” and “Mummification.” The “Refinery Smoke” pieces 
are a personal favorite because all the dresses gave off illusions of smoke, 
which covered parts of the mannequins’ bodies. The exhibit described van 
Herpen’s interpretations of smoke as “sinister, alive, and toxic,” and that 
by wearing it, one can have more control over such a dark and mysterious 
entity. The “Mummification” collection held this theme of wrapping, where 
most of the dresses were tightly fitted and some outfits were wrapped around 
more parts of the body than others. Its pieces also had a dark theme, repre-
sented by the dark colors of various dresses, and the exhibit describing the 
whole concept as “macabre.”
As you continue exploring more collections, you’ll find dresses made in 
innovative ways from some of the most unique materials; dresses made from 
children’s umbrellas, glass, and 3D prints are just a few examples. Several of 
the materials were put on sample display for visitors to experience and touch.  
Dresses in the “Wilderness Embodied” collection depicted “wild forces,” 
where the fabric from some dresses were made to look like actual leaves. 
The “Capriole” collection (capriole meaning “leap in the air” in French) 
was a unique one that presented the experience of free-falling. One of the 
dresses in this collection was crafted to look like the skeleton of a human, 
and it was supposed to represent the overwhelming feeling of terror before 
parachuting out of a plane. All the dresses from the different collections were 
captivating, however one from van Herpen’s “Crystallization” collection was 
particularly special in that it was the first 3D printed dress to ever walk down 
a runway. I’d advise you to visit the exhibit to find the dress and see it for 
yourself.
Van Herpen does her best to incorporate all the relevant themes and ideas 
we encounter in the world today. She tackles complex concepts which might 
be difficult for viewers to wrap their head around, such as the behaviors of 
natural forces or the effects of technology on society, and presents her inter-
pretations by crafting dresses in manners that make her focuses obvious. It 
makes sense that her pieces have attracted people from all over the world, 
including well known designers and celebrities like Beyoncé and Lady Gaga. 
Van Herpen has shown others how fashion can evolve at the same pace and 
in the same manner as culture and technology around the world. There’s a 
lot to learn from viewing her collections, and they’ll only be at the Carnegie 
Museum of Art until May 1, so be sure to check it out before then! 

---------------------------------------------------

Throughout the year, 17 of Carnegie Mellon’s fra-
ternities and sororities competed against each other 
to raise the most money for Pittsburgh’s chapter 
of Camp Kesem, a charity program that “operates 
free summer camps for children who have been 
touched by a parent’s cancer,” and to put on a 
13-minute musical performance. Greek Sing has 
partnered with Camp Kesem for two years to help 
raise $150,000, and started off towards their goal 
incredibly strong with a new Greek Sing record of 
$100,522.53 raised in the first year.
After Greek Sing chairs and emcees of the night, 
Alpha Chi Omega senior and senior drama major 
Stephanie Kane and senior information systems 
major and Sigma Chi brother Gus Henry gave their 
opening remarks, the organizations showcased their 
various skits and acts. Throughout the night, sorority 
and fraternity pairs competed in the doubles cat-
egory, performing intricate, condensed versions of 
full-length musicals.
The show kicked off with Kappa Alpha Theta and 
Alpha Sigma Phi’s performance of Peter Pan. While 
the group did not place, their creativity and the 
youthful energy of the original show shone through 
every part of their performance, from their inven-
tive “high-flying” choreography (people in black 
body suits carrying the cast around the stage) to 
their costumes. First-year Dietrich college student 
Jamie Slomka stood out as Peter Pan, leading the 
performance and the whole of Greek Sing off to an 
amazing start.
Following Peter Pan was Delta Delta Delta and 
Sigma Chi’s performance of Hercules, filled with 
show-stopping vocals from the five Muses and 
Megara. Delta Delta Delta and Sigma Chi’s per-
formance was the fan favorite of the night, mixing 
in humor and a classic Disney vibe with talent and 
nostalgia of the original movie. Alpha Chi Omega 
and Alpha Tau’s performance of The Little Mermaid 
brought Ariel’s world to life in its set pieces and 
energy, and showcased the voice of music and 
English major Sydney Roslin, who played Ariel, in 
the best way possible.
However, the performance that blew me away was 
the first act closer and first place performance of 
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Sigma Phi Epsilon’s ren-
dition of the new Disney classic Moana. The  
performance stayed true to the film’s original mes-
sage of discovering who you are, featured vocals 
that raised the energy of the room, showcased 
incredible sets with a giant puppet of Te Ka, and 
presented amazing choreography that truly utilized 
the human element of the story, with junior neuro-
science major Sarah Deluty, who played Moana 
throughout the performance, seamlessly climbing on 
top of her fellow performers to reach up to twelve 
feet above the ground in the performance’s final 
number. More importantly, it was a great image of 
the fraternity and sorority involved working together 
to create something magical for others, encompass-
ing what Greek Sing is all about.
Starting off the second act, and placing third over-
all, was Alpha Phi and Pi Kappa Alpha’s perfor-
mance of Little Shop of Horrors. The spectacular 
thing about this set was that every soloist had a 
flawless voice, truly bringing the musical to life. 
Coming from someone who hadn’t watched Little 
Shop of Horrors before Greek Sing, Alpha Phi and 
Pi Kappa Alpha retold the story in a great way 
that flowed well and made me want to check out 
the original. Additionally, the set pieces, such as 
Audrey II, helped to bring Skid Row to life through-
out the performance.
Second place winners alpha Kappa Delta Phi and 
Phi Delta Theta performed Once on this Island next, 
truly bringing out the heart of the show’s setting 
and bringing the energy and essence of the show to 
their performance. The choreography of the show 
helped to bring that energy out into the audience, 
and carried out throughout the performance thanks 
to the ensemble and the soloists. In particular, the 
soloist as Papa Ge stood out, truly becoming his 
character and commanding over the performance.
Delta Gamma and Delta Tau Delta performed 
second-to-last in their rendition of The 25th Annual 
Putnam County Spelling Bee, taking the audience 
back to a time before college with their fun chore-
ography, crazy costumes, and quirky energy. They 
brought the crazy energy of the original show to 
their performance and adapted the musical in a 
clever way.
Three fraternities competed in the singles category. 
In this category, the fraternities instead composed 
original skits featuring familiar melodies with new 
lyrics. Third place winners Kappa Sigma opened 
singles with their performance of El Dorado, taking 
Dora into a new direction by bringing her, Boots, 
and Diego to Carnegie Mellon as first-years in 
search of bananas. The craziness and hilarity of the 
number was an amazing addition to the event and 
kicked off the singles performances on a high note.
In the first act, Sigma Alpha Epsilon also performed

their original musical Rata-tool-y, a story set in a 
Lowe’s Department Store about a young power 
drill stuck on a shelf filled with screwdrivers who 
seeks to find his true parentage. Adapting songs 
like Beauty and the Beast’s “Belle” into their per-
formance, Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s creativity with 
their script, featuring breaking the fourth wall and 
meta jokes, earned them second place.
The final singles performance was from Alpha 
Epsilon Pi with their Jewish take on the Tony 
Award-winning The Book of Mormon called The 
Book of Moses. The brothers spectacularly adapt-
ed the hit musical and its hilarious vibe into a great 
performance, most notably by turning “Hello” into 
“Shalom,” that helped carry Alpha Epsilon Pi to 
first place.
Greek Sing was a truly memorable night that cel-
ebrated philanthropy in the best way. It featured 
the greek community coming together as a whole 
to make a difference and put on another amazing 
show, blowing away the Carnegie Mellon commu-
nity with their talent, creativity, and motivation and 
desire to contribute to help make an impact.

The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, a bus ride away 
from campus, is one of the homes of the flourishing 
arts culture in Pittsburgh. Arts education, exhibi-
tion space, residencies, and arts advocacy are 
the main focus of this organization, making it a 
useful resource for artists in the area. On Friday, 
the Center hosted an opening of the 2017 solo 
and collaborative exhibitions. In a large, canary 
yellow house, the space is inviting and well lit, 
offering rooms to wander through in the beautiful 
house. This particular show featured nine different 
exhibitions, with a total of thirteen Pittsburgh-based 
artists including Nikki Brugnoli, Jiyon Hong, Laurel 
Wilcox, and Carnegie Mellon professor of art 
Devan Shimoyama.
Walking the space is certainly an interesting expe-
rience, as the architectural features of the house 
make the space feel vastly different from what you 
expect from a traditional gallery. Each exhibition 
space feels more contained and the flow from 
exhibition to exhibition feels more casual, allow-
ing viewers to explore the space more freely. In 
a sampler sort of format, the show gives a sense 
of the themes that run through the Pittsburgh art 
scene. These works covered a variety of topics, 
dealing with memory, race, and narrative. This 
show is defined by a myriad of interesting and 
expertly contrasted textures, colors, and media. 
Hong’s delicate wire map of Pittsburgh and the 
contrast of clay, wood, and rope in Interdependent 
by Jonathan Shwartz and Angela Biederman are 
notable examples. The diversity of the materiality 
and subject matter in this show was exciting and 
full of potential, and it makes walking through such 
a large group exhibition more engaging.
In a show like this, where there are so many dif-
ferent exhibitions and no grounding theme, good 
curation is crucial. Part of our job as viewers is 
trying to untangle the intention of the artist and 
the context of the work, but the curators must also 
guide us along. Although a lot of art is intended 
to stand alone and be easily understood, all art 
requires a basis of knowledge to understand. In 
shows like this where there is no theme, the artists’ 
background are not well known, and the diversity 
of work is collected in an intimate space, the cura-
tion of individual exhibitions requires more thought. 
Each artist and collaborative team approached 
the explanation of their work differently, bringing 
us to the question of how one effectively use an 
artist statement.
The artist statement is presented to give the viewer 
context and hints at where to look to decipher 
meaning in work. There is a necessary balance 
between giving enough information for the audi-
ence to connect with the work, but leaving enough 
out for the audience to be motivated to explore 
and ask questions. At times, the artist statements 
and curation in these exhibitions made it challeng-
ing to connect with the work. Ambiguity in art is 
beautiful and important, but vague art jargon and 
broad concepts without specificity to the work will 
lessen the viewer’s ability to be invested. Each of 
the exhibitions were clearly working toward inter-
esting ideas and had expert command over medi-
um, but connecting with the work was challenging 
because some of the artist statements were poorly 
considered. Art needs to reach both experts and 
non-experts, and without either clear cues in the 
work or well crafted curation this cannot happen.
One exhibition that successfully considered the art 
and presentation was Oblivion by Misty Morrison. 
Walking through a narrow hallway to reach a 
series of large-scale paintings with haunting por-
traits and domestic scenes, the viewer is trans-
ported into the world Morrison creates. Her work 
has an undeniably cinematic quality, the lighting 
and compositions are almost like stills from a film 
noir movie. The portraits are intimate, but there is 
also sense of anxious anticipation. The figures are 
larger than life, and the language they use is famil-
iar enough that the initial connection the viewer 
makes with the work is immediate and effortless. 
This gives space to explore the overall narrative, 
to connect with the characters and bring your own 
stories to the setup. Thus, with enough information 
present in the paintings, the lack of artist statement 
worked. I am excited to see more of her work, as 
being in the space made me crave more of these 
styles of narrative to explore and peel apart.
The work of Carnegie Mellon professor Shimoyama 
and Danny Ferrell in He’s American contrast in 
many ways with the work of Morrison as they tack-
le portraiture and curation differently. Shimoyama 
and Ferrell are both faculty here at Carnegie 
Mellon’s School of Art, and their expertise in 
curation and painting is clear. The natural flow 
of the viewer through the series of paintings and 
sculptural installations could have you landing at 
the artist statement last. The installations and the 
quality of the paintings are opulent and beautiful, 
the vivid colors and the bejeweled installations add 
to the allusions to religious paintings. The presence 
of gradients and the graphic colors place these 
works, though surreal and magical, specifically in 
our time.
Their collaboration is seamless, the art plays off 
of each other and explores the lived experiences 
of race and queerness with nuance and softness. 
In their short artist statement they write about the 
American dream, the invisibility of intimacy and 
vulnerability in the gay male experience. Their 
work talks about America and luxury, and who 
this dream is for — a topic which is relevant more 
than ever in this political environment. In this case, 
the artist statement is important but, a testament 
to their work, it does not make or break the exhi-
bition. Rather, the artist statement adds depth to 
the exploration. It allows the viewer to step into 
the shoes of the characters the artist paint, and 
see American society through the eyes of those 
whose identities have been reduced down to 
political props.
With the recent defunding of the National 
Education Association and the continuing reduction 
in funding for arts education, artist and curators 
have to be especially mindful of the role art is tak-
ing in society. Going to a show with a group of 
such inspiring and talented artist and focusing on 
the idea of artist statements may be nit picky. But 
care and attention paid to contextualizing work 
makes art impactful. As an arts columnist, I have 
the incredible opportunity to talk to artists about 
their intentions for their work — their passion for 
their subject matter and practice is contagious, and 
it makes it easy to match their investment in their 
work. The artist statement is for those who don’t 
get to have that conversation. It is the artist’s direct 
communication with the audience and should not 
be taken for granted. This show was beautiful, 
diverse, and exciting in many ways. It displays 
incredible expertise and it is exciting to see what 
local artist are pursuing. But go in with the benefit 
of doubt, and leave yourself open to the questions 
that the art will undoubtedly pose, for better or 
for worse.

---------------------------------------------------

For most people, hearing about another person’s 
dreams can be boring and tedious. However, 
super-spy Sterling Archer, who has spent a fiction-
al lifetime flouting every rule imaginable, is, not 
surprisingly, an exception to this rule.
The seventh season of Archer ended with him 
shot, floating face down in a pool and the new 
season, dubbed Archer: Dreamland, extends the 
cliffhanger. Archer is in a coma in a hospital bed, 
and the season takes audiences into Archer’s 
imaginative subconscious. Creator Adam Reed 
continues to provide the raunchy, ridiculous humor 
and crisp, photorealistic animation the show is 
known for while adding a stimulating all-new set-
ting, a gripping plot, and a thought-provoking 
duality for Archer.
In Archer’s fantasy, the cast has been transported 
back to 1947, and each character assumes a new 
role. Archer is now a private detective searching 
for the murderer of his partner, Woodhouse, who 
in the regular Archer universe is his loyal, but 
heroin-addicted butler. In his hunt for answers, 
Archer crosses paths with a mob boss by the 
name of Mother — who is his actual mother 
Malory — and decides to do her a favor in return 
for help in his investigation. While on the job for 
Mother, he stumbles upon Cyril and Pam, now 
corrupt cops who are helping rival mobster Len 
Trexler (a rival spy in real life) smuggle prostitutes 
into the country. Some things haven’t changed, 
however: Archer is still lusting for Lana Kane, 
although now she is a sultry jazz singer.
The plot has no real bearing on the actual lives of 
any of the characters, but it is a captivating story 
nonetheless. Reed has done an excellent job of 
keeping the audience wondering what might hap-
pen next, with twists and turns keeping the audi-
ence on their toes. Furthermore, a wacky plot line 
has Cheryl — now the heiress to a vast publishing 
fortune, but no less insane than before — enlist-
ing Archer to help her flee her family via a faked 
suicide, and leaves the viewer in constant anticipa-
tion of what crazy stunt she’ll pull next. Each epi-
sode also ends with a cliffhanger, helping viewers 
become even more invested in the development of 
the story.
The plot is bolstered by the addition of a new, 
deeper, more serious side to Archer — he is haunt-
ed by Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from 
World War II, suffering from graphic flashbacks 
during action scenes. While Archer has always 
come off as cocky and incapable of true emotion, 
instead focusing his energy on exotic cars, alco-
hol, and women, there have been brief glimpses 
of Archer’s vulnerability. Evidence of Malory’s 
psychological abuse occasionally cropped up in 
the show and in Season 7, when Archer encoun-
ters a former prep school bully he still stammers 
and shakes in the bully’s presence. The PTSD 
Archer experiences from WWII might be acting as 
a metaphor for the nightmarish flashbacks Archer 
has to his difficult childhood, revealing why he 
feels he has to constantly assert himself and tor-
ment his co-workers. Reed also introduces a sur-
prising duality for quirky mad scientist Krieger, 
which hints that his Dreamland character may 
have honest intentions.
But don’t worry, Archer hasn’t gotten serious. 
While the first episode takes time setting up this 
new world inside Archer’s mind, there is still 
plenty of inventive, bizarre, and crude humor. 
Many of the funniest moments come from several 
running jokes that Reed employs throughout. 
For example, during scenes inside Dreamland, 
the club owned by Mother where Ray Gillette is 
now the bandleader, after any sexual innuendo 
the drummer plays a rimshot in the background, 
which is followed by Ray yelling at him in frustra-
tion. Aside from sexual comedy, Reed has an 
impressive ability to turn odd, cringe-worthy 
situations into laughable moments — like one 
morbid scene where Cyril is found cutting 
off a corpse’s finger to use as proof he 
has a hostage (something Archer and 
Cheryl were also about to do). While 
this grotesque moment shouldn’t be 
funny, the sharp-talking and sarcastic 
dialogue somehow makes it amusing. Of 
course, this being Archer, many of the 
the funniest lines are unprintable and the 
rest involve a convoluted set-up that would 
take half a page just to do them justice.
Archer is full of pop culture refer-
ences, and many of the more 
subtle jokes in Dreamland 
are parodies of the noir 
films and novels of the 
1930s and 1940s. In one 
scene, Archer narrates 
his thought process aloud 
as he drives, mimicking 
the deadpan style of 
storytelling found in 
noir, before the shot 
pans to a scruffy dog 
seated next to him 
and Archer admits 
not knowing why he’s 
talking to a dog. In 
another episode, 
there is an explicit reference to the greenhouse 
scene between General Sternwood and Philip 
Marlowe, played by Humphrey Bogart, from The 
Big Sleep.
Of course it wouldn’t be Archer without stunning 
animation. The vivid colors and intricate details of 
the Dreamland landscape create visuals so real-
istic that they begin to feel fantastical. The clean, 
flowing lines of the art-deco architecture and 
majestic vintage cars work perfectly with Archer’s 
crisp animation style, and the outdoor scenes in 
particular leave viewers in awe. The show also 
takes advantage of the endless opportunities that 
animation provides — with ice cubes dropping 
into a drink seen from the bottom of the glass or 
a seamless transition from a spinning vault lock to 
the speeding wire hubcaps of an antique car.
Despite the triviality of this season’s plot, as it 
lives solely in Archer’s head, the absurd story-
lines, constant cliffhangers, and development of 
Sterling Archer’s character leaves viewers yearn-
ing for the next episode.

Looking Forward — Combating Sexual 
Violence on Campus
On March 25, students from numerous colleges in the Pittsburgh area came together with their Title IX coordinators and local Pittsburgh artists to educate 
themselves about sexual and gender-based violence and brainstorm ways to combat this violence on college campuses. The summit included speeches 
by representatives from Carnegie Mellon and other local universities about what their offices have been doing in the past few years to combat sexual 
violence. These presentations highlighted the different approches each campus takes, with Carnegie Mellon focusing on providing surviver support and 
resources, Point Park University emphasizing holding perpetrators accountable, and other schools working on changing the culture around gender roles 
and expectations at large. The summit also involved a varietry of art projects that drove home the realities of the impact of sexual violence, including short 
videos by the local arts advocacy group STAMPED and photography by local high school students. People who attended the summit participated in an art 
instalation for Denim Day by writing messages about sexual violence on jeans and adding them to a sculpture that will be traveling around Pittsburgh in the 
coming weeks. Denim Day is a day during which people wear denim as a sign of protest against victim blaming and destructive attitudes that perpetuate 
rape culture. This year’s Denim Day is April 26. Find out more about the history behind the movement at denimdayinfo.org.
