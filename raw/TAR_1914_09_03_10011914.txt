FIRST WEDNESDAY 
MASS MEETING
STUDENT ACTIVITIES 
PRESENTED.
FOOTBALL SEASON OPENS SATURDAY
WayjBbiiif Is to Be Plaid's first Oppone.it
The first general lecture hour of the 
year for the Science students, Wed­
nesday, September 23, at 10:30 A. M., 
was devoted to a presentation of stu­
dent activities in Room 209, Science. 
Among the speakers were Coach Stef­
fens, Supervisor of Athletics McCul- 
loch, Dr. Esquerre, E. S. Rauh for 
Coach Dull, Manager Cowan of “The 
Tartan,” Baseball Manager Pringle, 
and President I. A. Cameron of the 
Musical Clubs. Wm. M. Sheldon, 
president of the Senior class, presided 
in accordance with the school custom.
After Sheldon’s explanation to the 
Plebes that they w'ere supposed to 
stand in the aisles if there was no 
room after the upperclassmen were 
seated, “Dink” Merrill led the packed 
room in the old yells.
Coach Steffens made a plea for 
thirty or forty more men out on the 
field for football, although he seemed 
better satisfied with the showing than 
he did the week before. In ending, he 
reminded all the students of the first 
game a short way off in these words: 
“It’s the duty of every man here to 
be out on the field and back the team 
with their presence and cheers. When 
you’re up against it, and need an extra 
yard, I tell you the crowd helps a 
lot.”
McCulloch’s talk contained some 
excellent advice and encouragement. 
He said in part: “I think it’s a good
thing to get out on the field and learn 
what you can’t in your classes. You 
can’t all be football players and you 
can’t all be baseball players, but you 
can do yourself a lot of good by com­
ing out. Hazelton came out and 
worked hard his first year, and worked 
hard his second year without doing 
anything special; but he went like a 
streak last year and smashed the mile 
record on the Oval. You can’t all be 
Hazelton’s, but you can improve your 
physique. It’s a pity that so many 
Plebes who come to gym lack physi­
cal co-ordination. It may be a ques­
tion of life or death with you fellows 
sometime when you go out on engi­
neering construction, wtiere you’ve got 
to move in time, not a second too 
late.” At the close of his few words 
Mr. McCulloch requested that the stu­
dents elect a fellow of good business 
judgment for a post on the Athletic 
Board of Control.

The time is drawing near for the 
opening of the 1914 football season. 
The student body is no doubt anxious 
to see the men in action as evidenced 
by the large crowds that have been
CAPT. McCAUGHEY
filling the bleachers to watch the team 
go through their daily workout. Little 
has been said from the official camp 
regarding the prospects for the com­
ing game and Coach Steffens is mak­
ing no predictions. The coach seems 
to be mofe a man of action than of 
words, and of late, by the manner in 
which he has been driving his men, he 
surely has been making his actions 
speak much louder than any words 
that he could possibly utter.
The team is gradually rounding into 
shape and should present a formidable 
front against Waynesburg this Satur­
day. A definite line-up has not yet
MR. FF 
REÏURNS 10II. S.
been decided upon, although there are 
quite a few men who stand out prom­
inently as candidates for the different 
positions. Either Hellstrom or Traut- 
man will be seen at the center posi­
tion with the chances favoring the 
former. “Whitey” has been playing 
a fast game and has been getting the 
ball to the backs in a very accurate 
manner. Trautman has been showing 
much fight and the “Gunboat” should 
no doubt make it decidely interesting 
for some of the enemy when he gets 
into the game; furthermore he is thor­
oughly versed in warfare and this 
knowledge should be quite an asset. 
There is an abundance of good men 
for the guard and tackle positions. 
Capt. McCaughey, Crawford Holz- 
worth, Welch, Fletcher, Kelly, Boi- 
leau, Fremuth and Morley stand head 
and shoulders over all the other candi­
dates. It is probable that Welch and 
Fletcher will start at the guards, while 
McCaughey and Crawford should be 
seen at the tackles. Welch has proved 
his worth already in the past three 
seasons. He is a sterling and depend­
able player, tackles hard and follows 
the ball closely. Fletcher has shown 
a decided improvement over last 
year’s form and should make a credit­
able showing. At the tackles, we will 
probably be strongest. Capt. Mc­
Caughey is playing the best game of 
his career; he has taken the responsi­
bility as captain and is holding up 
nobly. His aggressiveness has been 
a feature of every practice game and 
he has been instilling much confidence 
into the men by his continual talk 
during play. The tackle position is 
much more adapted to him than guard 
because it gives him more chance for 
action. Crawford has been upholding 
his previous record and is proving 
himself to be a tower of strength in 
the line. He has a brilliant future here 
because he is only a Plebe and should 
be available for some time to come. 
Athletics will begin to thrive here 
when we get more prep school men 
like Crawford.
At the ends and in the backfield is 
where we show the need of men. We 
have the quality but not the quantity. 
Lauer, Cunningham, Mitchell and 
Hantman are showing up well. Lauer 
has completely recovered from the in­
jury that rendered him hors de com­
bat last year, and is playing a game 
that no doubt has cinched the left end

SAYS HE DOES NOT BLAME 
KAISER FOR WAR.
Mr. Carnegie, accompanied by his 
wife and daughter, returned to Amer­
ica on September twenty-fifth on 
board the steamship Mauretania. He 
seemed very glad to be back in this 
country, and when questioned con­
cerning the war, he said he did not 
blame the Kaiser for it.
“I know the kaiser well,” said Mr. 
Carnegie. “He is the most sorrowful 
man in Europe today. The emperor 
went to sea for a vacation. He was on 
his yacht when he heard of the trou­
ble. He got into communication with 
Berlin. He was called back, and went 
with all speed. When he got there 
the mischief was done.
“His ministers are responsible for 
the entire affair. The German em­
peror has done more for developing 
Germany than any other ruler of his 
time. He has made schools, he has 
pensioned the working classes and he 
has helped the laboring man. Kaiser 
Wilhelm came into power and found 
Germany, under Bismarck, an uncivil­
ized community.
“Things have taken such a turn 
that I believe Sir Edward Gray said 
exactly the right thing when he made 
the statement: ‘We are not fighting
the German people, but German mili­
tarism.’
“German militarism overrules the 
great men of Germany. The great 
men of Germany are not members of 
the court, but are scientists, phil­
osophers and the real leaders of Ger­
many’s progress.
“The rulers of the world gather 
around them men who feel that they 
also have a tenure of office, and form 
these military cliques, such as was 
formed in Germany, and they took 
such action as instigating this war 
during the absence of the kaiser him­
self.
“Now that the war is on, I am de­
lighted to find that England has as 
great and able a statesman as Sir Ed­
ward Grey. He is a man who will 
lead them in the right way; he is a 
man who does not say things without 
meaning them. There is no greater 
statesman in the world today.”
“To get back to a republic at peace 
and a country of the brotherhood of 
men is wonderful,” he said.
“To get back here where there is

TARTAN BOARD COMPETITION.
The Tartan hereby announces the 
opening of the annual fall competition 
for positions on its editorial staff. The 
competition is open to both day and 
night students and will continue until 
Thanksgiving. The names of the suc­
cessful candidates will be published in 
the issue of December third.
The opportunity for prospective re­
porters is particularly encouraging 
this year. It is the intention of the 
present board to materially increase 
its size for the purpose of reducing the 
individual assignments each week and 
of enabling the various editors to pay 
as much attention as possible to the 
quality of their work. The foregoing 
statement should make evident the 
fact that “quality” will be the main 
factor upon which the contestants will 
be rated, although it will not be the 
only means of judgment. Both the 
quantity of news submitted and the 
personality of the competitor will be 
taken into consideration. Previous ex­
perience on the staffs of high school 
or other school papers is not essential. 
A working knowledge of English 
grammar and the ability to state clear­
ly the information to be conveyed to 
the reader, are the only requirements 
for entrance to the competition. All 
contributions should bear the name 
and class of the writer and should be 
placed in The Tartan boxes in the 
various schools or handed to one of 
the members of the board not later 
than 8:30 o’clock on Monday morn­
ings.
A large number of students are 
urged to compete. Technical training 
in its trend toward specialization often 
becomes narrow and not enough time 
is given to the non-technical side of 
the education. Here a chance is of­
fered to men interested in more than 
the single course of studies they are 
pursuing, to improve their writing 
ability, in addition to becoming ac­
quainted with all of the activities oc­
curring about school.
THE SEASON’S OPENING.
Saturday will witness the opening of 
the 1914 football season for Carnegie. 
The initial game will be especially im­
portant not only because it will be the 
first contest, but because it will dem­
onstrate for the first time, the new 
football policy adopted last spring. At 
that time, Walter E. Steffens, of the 
University of Chicago, was secured as 
coach and with him there was intro­
duced here a new style of play, one 
which differs greatly from that for­
merly in practice.
That the change of policy will mark 
the beginning of a new era in our 
athletic history is the earnest desire 
and hope of every one interested in 
this school. There has been a notice­
able improvement in the general phys­
ical stature of the candidates for the 
football team, which appears more 
formidable than in previous years. The 
establishment of a training house to­
day, signalizes another step forward 
in our advancement toward legitimate 
athletic, supremacy. All things con­
sidered the indications point to a ban­
ner football season.
Aside from pointing to the optimis­
tic outlook, we do not care to venture 
a prediction at this early hour. We 
realize too well the uncertainty a new 
undertaking invokes upon itself. But 
whatever the result of the coming 
games may be, we urge the students 
to give the team their heartiest sup­
port. An ambition worth having is one 
worth striving for. If Carnegie is to 
possess a representative football team, 
time and energy must be expended to 
develop it. Should we not be entirely 
victorious this season we hope that at 
least the foundation of our future 
greatness may be established. In ac­
complishing this purpose, no matter 
how large or small a part they may 
play, we wish Captain McCaughey and 
his men unqualified success.
PRESIDENT’S PEACE 
PROCLAMATION.
The efficacy of prayer has long been 
and probably will continue to be, a 
much mooted question. It is of such 
a nature, however, as not to permit of 
discussion in a paper of this kind. But 
when the president of the country sees 
fit to set aside a day of prayer for a 
particular purpose, we deem it our 
duty to present his proclamation to 
our readers:
By the president of the United 
States of America.
A PROCLAMATION 
Whereas, Great nations of the 
world have taken up arms against one 
another and war now draws millions 
of men into battle whom the counsel 
of statesmen has not been able to save 
from the terrible sacrifice; and
Whereas, In this, as in all things, 
it is our privilege and duty to seek 
counsel and succor of Almighty God, 
humbling ourselves before him', con­
fessing our weakness and our lack of 
any wisdom equal to these things; and 
Whereas, It is the especial wish and 
longing of the people of the United
States, in prayer and counsel and all 
friendliness, to serve the cause of 
peace;
Therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, 
President of the United States of 
America, do designate Sunday, the 
fourth day of October next, a day of 
prayer and supplication, and do request 
all God-fearing persons to repair on 
that day to their places of worship, 
there to unite their petitions to Al­
mighty God that, overruling the coun­
sel of men, setting straight the things 
they cannot govern or alter, taking 
pity on the nations now in the throes 
of conflict, in his mercy and goodness 
showing a way where men can see 
none, he vouchsafe his children healing 
peace again and restore once more that 
concord among men and nations with­
out which there can be neither happi­
ness nor true friendship nor any 
wholesome fruit of toil and thought in 
the world; praying also to this end 
he forgive us our sins, our ignorance 
of his holy will, our willfulness and 
many errors, and lead us in the paths 
of obedience to places of vision and 
to thoughts and counsels that purge 
and make wise.
In witness whereof I have hereunto 
set my hand and caused the seal of the 
United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this 
eighth day of September, in the year 
of our Lord one thousand nine hun­
dred and fourteen, and of the inde­
pendence of the United States of 
America the one hundred and thirty- 
ninth.
Woodrow Wilson.
By the President:
William Jennings Bryan,
Secretary of State.
AN EXAGGERATION.
There has lately reappeared a type 
of logician that attempts to establish 
its arguments by means of exaggera­
tion. Fortunately, however, the ef­
forts of such a class are usually 
thwarted by persons who possess an 
exact knowledge of the status of af­
fairs and who may therefore, correct 
any false impressions that are created. 
These remarks have reference to a re­
cent controversy concerning hazing at 
Carnegie which has been carried on 
through the press of this city, by one 
or two seemingly indignant gentle­
men.
Although the Tartan has sanctioned 
the action of the Science School in 
abolishing hazing, we are not so nar­
row minded to denounce with epithets 
of “assault,” “larceny,” and “kid­
napping,” the harmless “horse­
play,” as it has been termed, 
enacted by the persecuted Plebes 
at the demand of the relentless 
Sophomores of the Design and 
Industries Schools. Furthermore, in 
view of the recent accusations, we be­
lieve it is in no way a contradiction 
of our previous statement, to defend 
the little hazing that occurred this 
year.
Such atrocities as removing colored 
neckties, compelling Plebes to march 
with bared limb and with coats turned 
inside out, holding races in which 
matches were propelled by means of 
nasal protrusions, and other similar

acts of villiany, are really unheard of 
in college,—in the sense that they are 
too mild. On the contrary, the exer­
cise obtained by the so-called victims 
will prove of benefit rather than of in­
jury to them. Our heart bleeds for 
our disgraced schoolmates who will 
be designated till the end of their days 
as thieves and kidnappers. How much 
wforse is such a branding than the 
deeds which prompted it?
Next year we hope any unpleasant­
ness and misunderstanding may be 
averted by the total abolition of haz­
ing at Carnegie. We regret the occur­
rence of the present trivial incident 
and should have passed it by unno­
ticed, had it not been for the mislead­
ing impression of our institution and 
its officials that might have resulted 
from what we believe to be an un­
called for and unjust exaggeration.

CROSS-COUNTRY MEN START 
WORK.
Even though football now occupies 
the center of the athletic stage, never­
theless preparations are being made 
to usher in another sport, namely, 
cross-country running. All the old 
men, who have already had a “whirl 
at the game,” are beginning to report 
in order to get into condition for a 
busy season; but the number of these 
is small and we are sorely in need of 
new men if we expect to have a suc­
cessful year. Little remains of last 
season’s championship team. Capt. 
Haselton, McMillan, Campbell, Hand- 
elman and Dunseith composed the 
winning quintet of 1913, but of this 
number only two men can be counted 
upon, Handelman and Dunseith. Mc­
Millan was lost by graduation, while 
Campbell and Haselton have not re­
turned to school. Haselton is expect­
ed back but cannot be depended upon 
on account of the unfortunate accident 
that he sustained last year. He is now 
recuperating at his home in Saranac 
Lake and we have the good news from 
him that he is rapidly rounding back 
into good health. We are sure that 
this news will bring joy to “Hasy’s” 
many friends, and we all wish him a 
speedy recovery, one that will be able 
to bring him back to us in shape to 
compete in the coming track season.
What we really need is men; new 
recruits, green peas, or anything that 
you will call them. We need some­
thing for the coach to work upon, 
something that he can develop into a 
team. Fat or lean, long or short, or 
even average men will do. We need 
a large sized squad, about fifty or 
seventy-five men.
This sport requires little experience 
or skill but a lot of training and con­
ditioning. It is not as awful as the 
name implies. If you will but come 
out, you will soon see how enjoyable 
cross-country running really is. The 
runs at first are not long and merely 
consist of short jogs of a mile or two 
through the park. The benefits devired 
are innumerable; the run together 
with Bert’s store of alcohol, his rub­
bing ability, his good nature and store 
of jokes puts a fellow into a much bet­
ter condition to go after his nightly 
task of “burning the midnight oil.” 
Come out, fellows, and make yourself 
acquainted with the coach; see what 
he has to say. He is at the gym every 
day during the week after 4:30. You 
will find him a pleasant fellow and one 
that will readily tell you all about the 
matter. New men need not feel the 
least backward, as the coach has quite 
a reputation at developing green ma­
terial. Track and basketball men 
should especially be interested in this 
announcement of the starting of the 
cross-country running season as it is 
an early inducement to get into shape 
for the coming season in these other 
lines of endeavor.
The schedule has not yet been ar­
ranged but it is expected to have sev­
eral meets this fall. We expect to 
have dual meets with P. A. A. and Pitt, 
the Pitt meet to take place on the 
same day as the football game and 
the finish to be run right on Forbes 
Field prior to the game. We will
probably enter a team in the Crafton 
meet which is usually run on Thanks­
giving Day. Last year we won the 
meet, our team defeating teams en­
tered from Pitt, State and W. & J. 
This meet generally marks the close 
of the season as indoor track is start­
ed soon after, but a chance to get into 
good condition, to run three times in 
competition, and to win a letter should 
be a big enough inducement to bring 
the men out. Now, don’t forget, fel­
lows, any day at the gym after 4:30.
MR. CARNEGIE RETURNS TO U. S.
Continued from Page 1 
not a soldier or a guard to be seen. 
What a contrast! You have no idea 
what confusion exists in Great Britain 
today. We Americans should be the 
most thankful people in the world. It 
behooves us to maintain our neutral­
ity and set the countries of Europe an 
example. We really have 48 states 
here in our country. They form one 
union, a union of the brotherhood of 
man.
“You don’t know how far in ad­
vance of Europe we are, and this war 
has put the continent farther behind 
than ever.
“We have abolished slavery—the 
owning of man by man. We next 
should abolish war—the killing of man 
by man.”
“Is it true, Mr. Carnegie,” asked a 
reporter, “that the war will be declared 
a draw and that peace will be the out­
come at once, as reported in some 
dispatches?”
“No friend of lasting peace could 
seriously consider such a proposition 
as that at this time,” replied Mr. Car­
negie. “It would be inhuman and 
short-sighted to stop it now. Such 
action would only mean an armed 
truce and the resumption of hostilities 
at an early date. The hope that social­
ism might end the war has burst in its 
bubble.
“Since the war began it has been 
proven that the socialists have the 
human weakness for fighting.
“There is only one way to end war 
and that is to have an international 
court, an international police court, 
you might call it, where the nations 
could settle their differences and 
where not more than two nations 
could become allies. The nations of 
the world should uphold the power of 
the court and allow none to violate its 
verdict.”
IDEALISM OF THE NEWER 
EDUCATION.
Director Hamerschlag, in his an­
nual address to the students of the 
School of Applied Industries, held 
Tuesday morning, September 22nd, 
spoke on the “Idealism of the Newer 
Education.” In his remarks he showed 
the uniqueness of Industrial Educa­
tion as a breaking away from the edu­
cation of the feudal times and as fit­
ting in with the evolution of chemis­
try, machinery, discoveries in elec­
tricity and the conquest of the air of 
the twentieth century.
He spoke of the School of Applied 
Industries as offering a type of work
fascinating in the extreme, where the 
so-ocalled dead materials, iron, steel, 
wood, brick, etc., are vitalized and 
energized for doing the world’s work. 
It differs from the Engineering School 
in that it is not industrial engineering 
but aims towards production, and also 
in teaching how to handle men and 
thus fitting one for a type of leader­
ship. It is differentiated from the Art 
School in the sense that the commer­
cial differs from the artistic. Yet the 
schools are interdependent and the 
chief distinction lies in the differences 
of entrance conditions and idealism. 
He advised the students to become 
thoroughly acquainted with the four
GRAND.
The charm of mimicry sans the in­
nocuous formality of set impersona­
tion is ingeniously preserved in the 
tabloid musical comedy, “The Lawn 
Party,” wihich Mr. Harry Davis is 
heralding as one of nine vaudeville 
novelties for next week, beginning 
Monday afternoon, October 5, at the 
Grand Opera House. There will be 
several other interesting attractions in 
the forthcoming program, in addition 
to exceptional moving pictures.

The officers of the Senior class for 
the coming year were elected at a 
class meeting held Wednesday, Sep­
tember 23rd. The results of the elec­
tion were as follows:
President, Eliza Dickey.
Vice President, Esther E. King.
Secretary, Nelle M. Kern.
Treasurer, Edythe Dougherty.
Rep. on Com. of Entertainments, 
Lydia D. Bates.
This is the second time that Miss 
Dickey has been chosen president of 
her class in Margaret Morrison. Her 
unusual ability and strong personality 
have won her wide popularity among 
the girls. The Seniors knew they could 
do no better than to re-elect the one 
who guided their class so smoothly 
and successfully through its Junior 
year.
JUNIOR CLASS ELECTION.
The officers for the Junior class were 
elected Monday, September 21st: 
President, Grace G. Searight.
Vice President, Golda McClelland. 
Secretary-Treasurer, Mary Louise 
Irwin.
Rep. on Com. of Entertainments, 
Charlotte E. Watson.
DIRECTOR HAMERSCHLAG 
ADDRESSES ASSEMBLY.
Last Tuesday, at one o’clock, Di­
rector Hamerschlag addressed the stu­
dent body at a meeting held in the as­
sembly hall of the Margaret Morrison 
building. This was the first time that 
the Director has paid us a visit since 
last year.
His message was one of cheer and 
good will, and was appreciated by all. 
The girls wish to echo the words said 
by the Director during his talk—that 
is, that he hoped to be with us oftener 
this year than he was last.
SWIMMING TO BE TAUGHT 
UNDER DEPARTMENT 
OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION.
It will be of interest to the Margaret 
Morrison girls to learn that on Friday 
of every week, Miss Stoner and Miss 
Mason, of the Department of Physical 
Education, will give instruction in 
swimming and diving at the Oakland 
Natatorium.
The opportunity to join these classes 
is open to every girl in the school, and 
it is hoped that the attendance will be 
good.
Miss Stoner has obtained special 
rates from the manager of the Nata- 
torium, and if there are ten girls or 
more in the class, tickets may be had 
fjr fifteen cents, the regular price be­
ing twenty-five.
The Natatorium is conveniently lo^ 
cated and the hours of instruction will 
be in the afternoon. Any girl who 
desires to attend, must make arrange­
ment with Miss Stoner before Friday 
noon each week.
ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION NEWS
On Monday afternoon, October 5th, 
the Athletic Association will hold its 
regular rally in the gymnasium’ of the 
Margaret Morrison School.
An interesting program is being ar­
ranged and every effort put forth by 
the committee in charge, to bring 
about a sure enough good time. Fore­
most on the program will be a short 
basketball game between the Seniors 
and Junior teams. There will be other 
games in which every one may take 
part, music, and dancing. School songs 
will be sung and cheers given. All 
members of the Association are in­
vited to be present.
Before the regular assembly next 
week, the Athletic Association will 
haAre ready for distribution, the school 
songs, cheers and yells. These will be 
printed and bound in pamphlet form, 
and given to the girls for their own 
use in assembly, student body meet­
ings, Athletic Association rallies, and 
other occasions.
The Association wishes to thank 
Miss Stoner, Miss Lu Hartman, presi­
dent of the student senate, and Miss 
Anna Thomas, chairman of the com­
mittee in charge, for their assistance 
and co-operation in collecting these 
songs.
MARGARET MORRISON GIRL 
MARRIED.
Every year cupid enters our college 
and takes from its best some victim. 
This time it was one from' the class of 
’15. Miss Ruth Jones was married 
during the summer to John Thomas 
Andrew, of Oakmont. Miss Jones en­
tered as a Plebe three years ago, and 
has many friends in the school.
ADVISORS ENTERTAIN PLEBES.
Friday afternoon, the Plebe advis­
ors, Miss Belleville, Miss Collett, Miss 
Jesse, Miss Davis, Miss Speer, Miss 
Marvin, Miss Hyde and Miss Dixon, 
entertained the Plebes most delight­
fully in the gymnasium. The pro­
gram1 for the afternoon consisted of 
interesting games and contests.
A bean contest which was carried 
on throughout the afternoon furnished 
much amusement, and was finally won 
by Miss Cooper, who was awarded as 
a prize, a small lantern filled with 
beans.
Going to Jerusalem' proved a mirth­
ful experience. Every one got well 
acquainted with every one else, and 
the close race between Miss Marvin 
and Miss Jones was very exciting.
Next on the program was an ex­
hibition of present day styles which 
was as true as it was ridiculous. Fol­
lowing was a pop corn stunt. Five 
couples, blind folded and sitting oppo­
site, attempted to feed each other pop 
corn from spoons. Miss Mahon, one 
of the participants, furnished the chief 
entertainment.
A clever guessing contest was next 
on the program. Each one was given 
some kind of animal which she had to 
sketch on the black board, and the rest 
tried to guess what it was. Misses
Cooper, Wurtz, Crawford and Jones 
guessed all of the illustrations correct­
ly. Miss Jones drew the prize which 
was a lovely pet dog.
Director Hamerschlag and Dean 
Breed were present, and the hostesses 
for the afternoon were Miss Belleville, 
Miss Marvin, Miss Speer and Miss 
Jesse.
DORMITORY GIRLS ENTER­
TAIN.
Saturday afternoon, the girls of the 
Morewood avenue dormitory gave a 
reception for the new girls at Mar­
garet Morrison. Nearly every member 
of the Plebe class was present, and 
enjoyed meeting the girls, and getting 
a glimpse of the “dorm” life in their 
own school.
The girls of the Fifth avenue dor­
mitory entertained themselves at an 
informal party, Friday night. Games 
were played in which Miss Adams 
won the prize. A general good time 
followed.
TEACHERS’ COLLEGE— A 
CORRECTION.
In last week’s Tartan there appeared 
an item on page 5 under the head of 
“Teachers’ Club Elects Officers.” This 
should have read “Teachers’ College 
Elects Officers,” as the two above 
named organizations are not the same.
SENIOR TABLES.
Beginning the middle of this week 
Dr. Esquerre is to have the tables lo­
cated at the east end of the “Beanery” 
set aside for the exclusive use of the 
Seniors of the Science and Design 
Schools and members of the faculty. 
Plebes are cautioned about making use 
of these tables, unless they have aero­
nautic or aquatic aspirations. In plain 
“United States,” don’t forget the 
blanket and the foundry tank.
The old system of using a heated 
iron and dirty cloth presses the grime 
and dirt into your garments. Our 
sanitary machine steams it all out, and 
removes permanently the dirt, per­
spiration, odor and grime. See Shu­

APPLIED INDUSTRIES
APPLIED INDUSTRIES.
The Student Assembly held its first 
meeting of the semester last Wednes­
day, all classes being on hand to wit­
ness the advent of another year of con­
tinued activities. The effect which 
this organization had on Industries af­
fairs, school welfare and educational 
inspiration bids fair to play an import­
ant factor during the present school 
year. With the Assembly Constitu­
tion printed in neat booklet form and 
a lucid explanation of the aims and 
purposes of the organization, the new 
men will soon realize the influence 
that body wields in the government of 
school matters.
The lectures provided during the 
past semester on industrial education 
and problems stimulated an interest 
which we hope will make itself mani­
fest in the ranks of the lower classes. 
The students who attended the former 
meetings may recall with pride the 
lecture on Industrial Education ren­
dered last April by Mr. Brindge of 
New York City; the splendid address 
on “Gypsum and its Manufacture” by 
a consulting engineer of the United 
States Gypsum Company, and the 
numerous other entertaining, educa­
tional reports. Already a program 
has been arranged for the coming As­
sembly meetings. Monday, Septem­
ber 28th, Mr. W. B. Williams, of Bos­
ton, will give a talk on “The Physical 
Qualities of Paper.” This lecture will 
afford many an opportunity to become 
better acquainted with the most mod­
ern methods in use for the manufac­
ture of this important product.
Dean Connelley, in addressing this 
initial meeting, spoke effectively 011 
the school’s aims and its relation to 
the other departments comprising the 
Institute. His announcement that the 
executive offices now lodged in Indus­
tries buildings would be converted into 
a club room as soon as the new offices 
in Central building are completed, was 
well received. The old club room has 
been utilized as an additional wing for 
the Forge shop. New furniture is al­
ready purchased and with the seven 
men on the Club Room Management 
Committee exercising good judgment, 
the new quarters should prove wel­
come to all. A new piano will also 
grace the rooms as will various liter­
ary and industrial periodicals.
Three scholarships were announced, 
one a refund of tuition plus a hundred 
dollars and two tuition refunds; these 
to be awarded at the regular meeting 
next Wednesday. Prof. Esquerre and 
Coach Steffens both spoke regarding 
the football situation, the former 
touching upon the health of the sport 
and the coach upon the support of the 
team.
UPPERS ELECT OFFICERS.
The Upper class of the School of 
Applied Industries met Tuesday, Sep­
tember 22nd, for the first meeting of 
the year. The most important busi­
ness was the election of officers for
the ensuing year and also the election 
of officers and representatives to the 
various boards which come under the 
“Student Assembly.” Mr. D. P. Mur­
phy, last year’s president, occupied the 
chair until new officers were elected 
and then turned the meeting over to 
the newly elected president, Mr. D. 
Orms, who, after thanking the class 
for the trust placed in him, then took 
control of the meeting.
Among some of the questions that 
came up were those of social activi­
ties to be given by the class during 
the coming year and the new problem 
of preventing smoking in the corri­
dors while we are temporarily without 
a club room. Both of these questions 
were rather premature considering the 
fact that the class was under new offi­
cers and that it was the first official 
meeting held this year so the former 
was dropped for the present while the 
latter was held over until some defi­
nite information could be obtained 
about our new club room. This ques­
tion will be brought up at the next 
regular meeting of the class to be held 
the coming week.
Mr. Frye then proposed a game of 
baseball with the middle year men and 
he and Mr. Kreider were appointed a 
committee to make all arrangements 
for this contest which will be played 
in the near future.
Upon motion of “Pete” Orr a vote 
of thanks was extended Mr. Murphy 
for his services and interest in the 
class during the time he has been pres­
ident. Mr. Murphy expressed his ap­
preciation and asked for the hearty 
support of upper classmen in the ques­
tions that came up before the assem­
bly.

THISTLE REPRESENTATIVES.
At a special meeting of the Indus­
trial Teachers’ College, held Septem­
ber 25th, Mr. F. J. Weigle was elected 
“Thistle” Representative, and Mr. F. 
A. Finlay was elected to represent the 
organization on “The Tartan.” With 
Mr. Shultz as publicity manager, and 
Mr. Finlay working together it be­
hooves all “Industrial” Teachers to 
watch “The Tartan” for important an­
nouncements.
The Bureau of Recommendations, 
which is associated with the Office of 
the Secretary, is a busy place this 
fall, owing to the industrial depres­
sion around the Pittsburgh district 
and the consequent scarcity of em­
ployment. Many applications have 
been received from the Night students, 
as well as the Day students. The 
office of the Bureau is open for inter­
views to. students seeking employ­
ment on every school day between the 
hours of 1:00 and 4:30 P. M., and on 
every Saturday from 9:00 to 12:00 
A. M.
Any student in the school, even if 
he does not seek assistance from this 
Bureau, can aid this important work 
by reporting to the office any place of 
which he has knowledge where a stu­
dent might secure employment, and 
of course these places vary anywhere 
from waiting on a table in a boarding­
house or clerking in a store on Satur­
days, to designing a house for an arch­
itect or doing interior decorating for 
some home.
The students who have placed ap­
plications with the Bureau can aid the 
work very materially by making- 
prompt reports on all positions for 
and by advising the office whenever 
which they are recommended and 
by advising the office whenever they 
secure work through their own ef­
forts.

the former was a “Triumphal Arch,” 
to serve as an entrance to a stadium 
where Olympic games are held; the 
latter a “Plant for the Manufacture of 
Firearms.” A large number turned 
out, promising good results.
FIRST WEDNESDAY MASS MEETING
Continued from Page 1
Next Dr. Esquerre spoke on his 
favorite subject. If 600 students will 
patronize the new commons, it will 
be a success from a financial stand­
point and perhaps more; but any 
“more” will be given back to the stu­
dents,—perhaps in a chicken and 
waffle dinner,—but given back never­
theless, according to the speaker. And 
by the length of the line about 11:30 
A. M.,.it ought to be a success. “I’m 
going to do my very darndest,” said 
Dr. Esquerre in regard to the Com­
mon’s future. Taking up the matter 
of the athletic training house, Dr. Es­
querre said in part: “The question of 
food brings me to the rather import­
ant problem of the training table, for 
the football player will have to eat. 
He ought to be free from any pains, 
or ‘I don’t feel very well!’ If there is 
a big fellow on the training table that 
needs a pound and a half of sirloin 
steak, and Steffens and I say he’s to 
have it, he’ll have it, and you will have 
to pay for it. Ginger, resistance and 
aggressiveness are what he needs, and 
you can’t give a man aggressiveness 
unless he has the wherewithal to get 
it, food.”
E. S. Rauh presented the cross­
country team work for Coach Dull. 
On account of the fact that only two 
of last year’s championship team re­
main, Dunseith and Handleman, the 
call for candidates for this sport is 
urgent. Each night at as soon as pos­
sible after school time, Coach Dull 
meets all the candidates at the gym 
and then takes them for a two to six- 
mile run through Schenley Park. In 
encouraging men who never ran be­
fore to come out, Rauh cited Mac­
Millan’s case, the last year’s Senior, 
who made the team at his first at­
tempt, and later broke the school’s 
record for the mile.
Arch Cowan, as business manager 
of “The Tartan,” asked for the patron­
izing of our paper’s advertisers. In 
a few words he expressed the mission 
of the paper when he said, “We be­
lieve that there is no better way of
keeping in touch with the school ac­
tivities, the faculty and alumni than 
through “The Tartan.”
Early as it is for baseball, Manager 
Pringle has arranged a splendid 
schedule with at least two good long 
trips, one through Pennsylvania down 
to Philadelphia, and another through 
Ohio. He announced that most of 
the Saturday games would be away 
from home, but Wednesdays’ will be 
at home. A request is before the fac­
ulty now for an earlier hour for end­
ing school on Wednesday afternoons, 
so everyone may go to the ball games. 
In regard to the team, Pringle said 
there would be needed at least two 
new outfielders, two new infielders, 
and some more pitchers.
Last, but far from least, I. A. Cam­
eron told the Plebes about the Musical 
Clubs. Director Scalzo will have 
charge of both this year. Everyone 
interested in the clubs is given a cour­
teous tryout. The first try-outs were 
last night. Rehearsals are held on 
Sunday afternoons in Room 104 A. I. 
Up to Christmas the work will be re­
hearsals, but after the first of the year 
concerts are given.
“Amici” and the “Stein Song” under 
Cameron’s leadership ended the hour.
These general lecture periods are 
the most valuable and interesting of 
the week, for in them you hear suc­
cessful men talk of their profession, 
and you learn to know your school. 
No Plebe should think of missing 
them, although there is no roll taken. 
But there is a remedy for that.

JUNIOR SCIENCE ELECT 
OFFICERS.
Wm. W. Lauer, president; Wm. N. 
Espy, vice president; W. W. Trout­
man, secretary; and Wm. Stein, treas­
urer, is the result of the Junior Science 
election held Wednesday, September 
24, in Room 210 Science, just after the 
mass meeting. The matter of some 
Junior insignia, like the Senior coats 
was suggested, but no action taken.
MHO CLUB MEETS.
Thursday afternoon, September 25, 
at 4:30 P. M., sixteen Electrical Engi­
neering students met in Room 104 
M. H. to hold the first meeting of the 
Mho Club for 1914-15. Vice President 
Stevenson of last year had charge of 
the meeting. Election of officers was 
by the club’s elimination nomination 
balloting, and thereby consumed al­
most all the time. Six ballots were 
cast before the tie between Wohlge­
muth and Lee was broken. The next 
meeting was arranged for last Mon­
day night, September 28, at 8 P. M. 
in 104 M. H. The day was chosen 
with respect to the Sophomore sched­
ule, so that all Sophs could be there 
without slighting their studies. A 
good turnout of 1917 men augured 
well for the success of the club this 
year. The officers follow:
President, A. D. Moore.
Vice President, G. A. Kaufman.
Secretary, A. M. Stevenson.
Treasurer, P. B. Harwood.
Executive Committee, C. Ettele, W. 
W. Headings, M. J. Wohlgemuth.
Faculty Advisor, Prof. Dennison.
Athletic Manager, Claude Ettele.
FIRST RADIO CLUB MEETING.
The Radio Club, Tech’s society for 
the equipment and maintenance of a 
wireless station at the school, held its 
first meeting of the year in Room 209, 
Science, Tuesday, September 23, 1914, 
at 4:30 P. M. About ten were present, 
most of them new men, which looks 
good. The election of officers result­
ed in the following slate:
President, G. A. Kaufman.
Vice President, Benj. Hantman. 
Secretary, W. W. Troutman. 
Treasurer, W. W. Headings.
MORE SURVEYING INSTRU­
MENTS ACQUIRED.
Prof. Stanton has lately added to 
the school’s equipment of surveying 
instruments, a new level manufactured 
by Bausch & Lomb and a transit made 
by B. K. Elliott & Co. The level, 
which is of the dumpy type, is of an 
entirely novel design, which, it is ex­
pected, will revolutionize the manu- 
facture of levels of that type. The 
acquirement of these two instruments 
practically fulfills the desire of Prof. 
Stanton, that there be a transit and 
a level of each prominent maker in the 
country, in his department.
New Pump in Hydraulic Lab.
The Wiley Mfg. Co., of McKeesport, 
have sent a new type of rotary pump
to the hydraulic laboratory for a com­
plete test. The manufacturers expect 
this pump to show a higher efficiency 
for that clats of pump than anything 
at present on the market.
ALUMNI NOTES.
Henry Wm. Gottfried, of the class 
of 1910, Night Science, was lately mar­
ried in Mexico City, Mexico, to Miss 
Zoila Gutierrez, of that city.
L. A. Huntley, 1908 Science, is at 
present in Cartagena, Columbia, with 
a geological field expedition of which 
he is in charge.
PROF. TRINKS’ VISIT ABROAD.
Inspected Foreign Technical Schools.
During the summer Prof. Trinks 
and his family traveled in Germany 
and England, both for the purpose of 
visiting relatives and for the purpose 
of gathering technical information.
In Germany, Prof. Trinks visited the 
technical schools in Charlottenburg 
and in Breslau with a view to studying 
the methods employed there in the 
teaching of steel works engineering. 
For the same purpose Prof. Trinks 
also visited the rolling mills at Peine 
where Dr. Puppe, former professor in 
steel works engineering, was residing 
as consulting engineer.
Prof. Trinks found that there is a 
great difference of opinion among 
various teachers as to what consti­
tutes the mechanical engineering of 
steel plants. In Charlottenburg it 
seemed to be all gas engines and stock 
handling, and in Breslau it seemed 
to be all roll pass design. Neither of 
the two schools visited, had labora­
tories for steel works engineering, but 
in Breslau conditions were ripe and 
money had been subscribed for a lab­
oratory. The war cancelled all there 
plans. In the opinion of Prof. Trinks, 
Dr. Puppe had very clear ideas on the 
teaching of mechanical engineering of 
steel works, but he took the somewhat 
radical stand that a school laboratory 
was unnecessary and that students 
could receive their laboratory instruc­
tion in the mill. As proof he cited the 
large number of tests which he had 
made with students and in which he 
had taken the students to the mill for 
two or three weeks at a stretch. Often 
he paid their entire expenses. In con­
sequence he incurred the disfavor of 
other teachers who found instruction 
seriously interrupted during that time 
and who claimed that Dr. Puppe was 
using the time of the students for con­
sulting work. When reminded of this 
difficulty, Dr. Puppe had to admit that 
a laboratory in steel works engineer­
ing would have made for better and 
more systematic instruction of the 
students.
On the 31st of July, that is to say 
one day before war was declared, 
Prof. Trinks was in Saarbruecken at 
the works of Ehrhardt & Sehmer. At 
3:00 o’clock that afternoon martial 
law was declared which resulted in the 
shutting down of all industrial works 
in that district, because martial law 
near the frontier means absolute ces­
sation of mail service, telegraph serv­
ice and banking service.
After standing in line for two days 
for his passport, Prof. Trinks and his 
family left Germany on the 2nd of 
August and spent several weeks in 
England, two of which were spent 
with relatives of Mrs. Trinks in Birm­
ingham. Prof. Trinks visited as many 
engineering works as possible during 
the time in England, but found con­
ditions growing steadily worse on ac­
count of the increasing number of men 
who left for the front and on account 
of the increasing suspicion of the Eng­
lish people for spies. As it was, Prof. 
Trinks had to register at practically 
every police station and was admitted 
to fewer and fewer works. The senti- 
which developed toward the middle of 
August was this: “We admit no vis­
itors now, not even British born peo­
ple.” Consequently the Trinks fam­
ily used the first opportunity to leave 
England and sailed on the 18th of 
August from Liverpool via the Cana­
dian line. The boat took the Northern 
course and entered the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence via the Straits of Belle Isle 
at the Coast of Labrador. This sec­
tion of the sea was full of enormous 
icebergs which impressed upon the 
passengers the wisdom of making the 
Straits of Belle Isle a forbidden pass­
age.
Among the other theories that have 
not worked in practise are these:
1. That our modern implements of 
war, being so terribly destructive, 
have made war impossible.
2. That financiers are the real 
masters of Europe.
3. That the spread of Socialism in 
Europe has made the rulers afraid to 
fight.—Kansas City Star.

FOOTBALL SEASON OPENS
Continued from Page 1
position. He is fast and sizes up a 
play quickly, besides being one of the 
hardest tacklers, if not the hardest, 
on the team. The other end position 
is doubtful, as there are said to be 
several dark horses out for the place; 
the above mentioned men will no 
doubt have to fight hard to get the 
job.
The backfield is light but very fast 
and have the advantage of playing 
together from last year. The leading 
candidates are Kessner and McDowell 
at quarter, Krieder, Balsinger, Mc­
Donald and Parke at halves, and Oef- 
finger at full. Kessner’s clever play 
from last year is familiar to all, and 
he is duplicating. “Bally” is again 
the old reliable and Kreider and Oef- 
finger are forming the German artil­
lery. They should crush the opposing 
allies back on land and sea, as they 
have already proved to be good mud 
horses. McDowell has had the mis­
fortune of having one of his lights 
put out, and has been absent from 
practice a number of times. As soon 
as he is able to see the ball, he will 
be back on the job and hard to stop 
as he is as fast as chain lightning this 
year. If “Little Mac” had more weight 
he wTould be a wonder. As said be­
fore, there has been no definite an­
nouncement as to. the exact line-up 
so that the entire matter is subject to 
change without notice and without 
libel or injury to the writer.
The men on the team have been do­
ing their part to get together. They 
have been playing on a very poor 
field. Coach Steffens sizes up the 
situation very well when he says: 
“Football in itself produces many in­
juries on a good field, but what about 
it when you have to play on a cement 
walk? Something should be done 
soon to get a good field to play on.” 
The men are playing under decided 
difficulties and it is up to the student 
body to show that they appreciate the 
situation. To do this, let everyone 
come out Saturday, prepared to cheer 
the boys on to the first of what we 
expect to be a long string of football 
victories. Waynesburg College will 
be our opponents and we hope to 
make them our first victims. Let’s 
get our voices in trim for some of the 
future games because it sure helps 
the boys along when they know that 
the students are behind them.

After looking over the war maps 
one is convinced that the Powers have 
been so successful in localizing the 
war that it covers pretty nearly every 
locality in Europe.—Memphis Com­

A MEN’S DORMITORY!
Plans are under way for the estab­
lishment of a new dormitory, not for 
“Maggie Murphys” but for the men 
students of the schools. A men’s 
dormitory is an institution for which 
there has been a long felt need, but 
which for practical reasons has not 
as yet been established. The dormi­
tory at present planned will be con­
ducted along the same general plan 
as the present existing M. M. C. S. 
dormitories, which are private resi­
dences that have been converted to 
meet student needs.
The charges for rooms and meals 
will be as low as possible, being in­
tended to cover expenses only. Such 
charges would probably run in the 
neighborhood of twenty-eight dollars 
a month. Secretary Field is desirous 
that all men students who are inter­
ested in such a dormitory would see 
him about it in order that he may 
form some definite idea’as to just how 
many students will desire accommo­
dation.
