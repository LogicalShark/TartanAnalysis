U.S. Secretary of Education visits CMU
Brandon Hong/Junior Photographer 
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, along with other noted authorities on education, spoke on a panel at Carnegie Mellon on Friday about 
the future of education in America.
VALENE MEZMIN
Junior Staffwriter
U.S. Secretary of Educa-
tion Arne Duncan, accompa-
nied by other noted of?cials 
involved in the education 
sector, ended his sixth annual 
“Ready for Success” back-to-
school bus tour at Carnegie 
Mellon University on Friday. 
Secretary Duncan’s main ini-
tiative with this tour has been 
to reach out to schools in the 
United States, and share his 
thoughts on where the presi-
dent’s cabinet stands on the 
state of education in this 
country. Secretary Duncan as-
sessed the past efforts of the 
department and where that 
will take the department in 
the future, touching on the 
challenges the nation still 
faces.
Students at Carnegie Mel-
lon come to realize the grow-
ing importance of education 
in today’s world, and the stu-
dent body’s appreciation of it 
to leads to successful, fruitful 
lives. By addressing the issues 
of college access and afford-
ability, and promoting a dis-
cussion about the efforts we 
can take to remedy them, Sec-
retary Duncan believes he is 
helping the nation move clos-
er to a better, brighter future.
Upon his arrival, Secretary 
Duncan was greeted with mu-
sic by the Pittsburgh Public 
School Drum Team, which is 
mostly comprised of young 
students with diverse back-
grounds. The rest of Kirr Com-
mons was ?lled with many 
Carnegie Mellon student on-
lookers, who happily waved to 
the panel upon their acknowl-
edgement, as well as graduate 
and post-graduate individu-
als involved in the education 
sector.
With this talk on educa-
tion, Secretary Duncan’s 
hope was to nourish students’ 
thoughts on their own path to 
success, and how they corre-
spond with their current posi-
tions on said path.
Executive director of the 
Garble Foundation Gregg 
Behr talked about the use of 
science and technology in 
the classroom for this very 
purpose, and how interactive 
learning has aided in the re-
tention of information. As a 
result of this, Behr said that 
studies have shown there to be 
a “doubling of algebra learn-
ing over a school year” as well 
as a ?ve-time retention rate 
increase in the sciences by in-
creased physical interaction.

On Wednesday, as life on 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus 
went on as per usual, busi-
ness executives, professors, 
and entrepreneurs from 
around the globe congre-
gated in the McConomy 
Auditorium to celebrate 
the 25th anniversary of the 
Carnegie Bosch Institute.
The occasion also 
marked the announce-
ment of a new gift from the 
Bosch Group. The gift, a 
total of $3.5 million, is split 
between the David A. Tep-
per Quadrangle and an en-
dowed professorship at the 
Institute. The professorship 
will receive $2.5 million, 
and the quadrangle will 
receive $1 million.
The Carnegie Bosch In-
stitute, or CBI, was created 
in 1990 as a collaboration 
between the Bosch Group, 
which is based in Germa-
ny, and Carnegie Mellon 
University. 
According to its website, 
the CBI “has been pursuing 
its mission of improving in-
ternational management 
and its impact on leadership 
by enhancing the knowl-
edge and performance of 
managers and executives in 
global operations, as well 
as supporting academic re-
search in the ?eld.” With 
the Tepper School of Busi-
ness’ international manage-
ment track, the relationship 
between CBI and Carn-
egie Mellon has been ever 
growing.
Since its inception, the 
CBI has worked as a part 
of the Tepper School of 
Business to educate future 
leaders about the intersec-
tion between innovation 
and entrepreneurship. The 
celebration on Wednesday 
highlighted several of the 
achievements that the part-
nership has yielded, as well 
as the potential that the 
Institute has to impact the 
future of global leadership 
innovation.
CBS executive producer 
Brittany McCandless (DC 
’08) served as the mistress 
of ceremony, while notable 
professors and business 
people alike gave keynote 
speeches, conducted pan-
els, and then performed 
lightning talks: six minute 
speeches followed by one 
question from the mod-
erator. The talks ranged in 
theme from Innovating for 
Society to Trends for the 
Future: Impact on Global 
Industry & Management, 
Innovation in Global Mar-
kets, Technologies for the 
Future, Leading Entrepre-
neurship & Innovation, to 
Systems Integration for 
Sustainability.
In the ?nal panel, three 
deans from Carnegie Mel-
lon spoke: dean of the Col-
lege of Engineering Jim 
Garrett, dean of the School 
of Computer Science An-
drew Moore, and dean of 
the H. John Heinz III Col-
lege Ramayya Krishnan. 
The panel was moderated 
by Mike Trick, the senior 
associate dean at the Tep-
per School of Business. The 
three deans spoke on the 
major changes that they 
anticipated would come to 
light within the next few 
decades of research and 
Emerson Chairman talks about business
BARBARA SAMANIEGO
Junior Staffwriter
Being a CEO in the mod-
ern business climate is a 
daunting challenge. The 
global economy is con-
stantly transforming, forc-
ing businesses to change 
and adapt in an unstable 
market. 
In the current period of 
economic instability and 
decreased growth, many 
stress that change is the 
ultimate way to save the 
organization — otherwise 
companies face dying out.
This is exactly what 
David Farr, chairman and 
chair executive of?cer of 
Emerson Electric Company, 
believes. Farr visited the 
Tepper School of Business 
at Carnegie Mellon this past 
week to discuss business 
strategy reform, his suc-
cesses, and his work as the 
CEO of a Fortune 500 com-
pany. Emerson’s original 
business model to sustain 
growth functioned very 
well from the year 2000 to 
the year 2012, but in 2012, 
the company experienced a 
signi?cant decrease in sales 
growth. 
As a result, Farr changed 
the structure of the com-
pany and adjusted his busi-
ness model to better suit a 
world of shrinking global 
?xed income.
Farr focused the new 
strategy on delivering bet-
ter growth, broader cus-
tomer solutions, more 
robust pro?tability, and 
higher returns. “Without 
growth, no company can 
make an earning in the 
long run,” Farr said.
The foundation of 
Emerson’s new business 
strategy is made up of the 
management process, the 
talent within the company, 
the technology, and the 
investments. 
The management pro-
cess must be reworked 
every year to ensure the 
company’s growth. The tal-
ent in the company must 
be reallocated to its most 
optimal position; Emerson 
needs “the right people, in 
the right places, with the 
right resources,” Farr said.
In addition, global tech-
nology must be carefully 
monitored and updated 
to suit customers’ needs 
and to maintain the com-
pany’s leadership in the 
market. Some new tech-
nologies may be disrup-
tive to older companies, 
so Emerson must under-
stand new technological 
developments and be will-
ing to adapt to the chang-
ing world. “Emerson is 
utilizing the key disruptive 
technologies of the 21st 
century to unlock new op-
portunities for growth,” 
TOC makes changes to combat crowding
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
Next week, students will 
?ock to the Jared L. Cohon 
University Center (CUC) for 
the annual Technical Oppor-
tunities Conference (TOC). 
During the conference, com-
panies vie for students’ at-
tention as they recruit for 
both summer internships and 
full-time employment oppor-
tunities. The TOC comes on 
the heels of last Wednesday’s 
Employment Opportunities 
Conference (EOC), which is 
geared toward non-technical 
majors, and Friday’s Business 
Opportunities Conference 
(BOC).
This year, the organizers 
of the TOC have made several 
changes to accommodate the 
popularity of the job fair. For 
the second year, the TOC will 
now stretch across three days 
— Monday Sept. 28, Tues-
day Sept. 29, and Wednesday 
Sept. 30. On the ?rst day, the 
fair will be in both the Wie-
gand Gymnasium and Rangos 
Hall; on subsequent days it 
will only be held in the gym-
nasium.
The TOC is a joint effort 
between the College of Engi-
neering and a team of student 
leaders, who start planning 
the conference during the 
spring semester. Each year, 
the previous TOC committee 
— a group of ten students — 
selects two directors for the 
following year. This year’s 
directors, chosen after a rig-
orous interview process, are 
junior materials science and 
engineering major Penelope 
Ackerman and senior electri-
cal and engineering major 
Yiru Yao.
After all ten committee 
members are chosen, they 
are divided into four sub-
committees: corporate rela-
tions, public relations, human 
resources, and operations. 
Each team works on its own 
timeline to ensure that the 
fall TOC runs smoothly. The 
corporate relations team, for 
example, begins reaching out 
to companies in the spring to 
get all interested employers 
registered by the early August 
deadline.
Nearly 500 companies are 
recruiting at the TOC, with a 
focus on students in techni-
cal majors. To meet ?re codes, 
as well as to ease crowding 
in Wiegand Gymnasium and 
Rangos Ballroom, event or-
ganizers have changed the 
schedule and structure of this 
year’s TOC.
Each day, the TOC will be 
geared toward internships 
from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. From 1 
to 2 p.m. there will be a man-
datory lunch break for the re-
cruiters, and from 2 p.m. to 5 
p.m. the fair will focus on stu-
dents seeking full-time offers. 
This shift in strategy will “keep 
students ?owing through, and 
staying within the numbers 
that we can have in a given 
space at a given time,” Senior 
Director of Strategic Programs 
and Special Projects for the 
College of Engineering Kelly 
McQuoid told The Tartan.
McQuoid, who organizes 
the TOC each year with help 
from the student leaders, said 
that the days will also be bro-
ken down by major. 
Monday is open to ev-
eryone, Tuesday will focus 
on computer-based majors, 
and Wednesday will focus on 
other science and engineer-
ing majors, including biology, 
chemistry, and all majors in 
the College of Engineering 
other than electrical & com-
puter engineering.
Students attending the 
TOC will also receive name 
tags, color-coded by major, 
McQuoid said, so that TOC 
staff and recruiters can bet-
ter help students ?nd what 
they’re looking for. Because of 
this change, students hoping 
to attend must register for the 
TOC ahead of time on Tartan-
trak.
These strategies, McQuoid 
said, will help ease the long 
lines and overcrowding that 
have long characterized the 
TOC. 
In previous years, “Stu-
dents didn’t feel like they 
could get in front of the em-
ployers that were there for 
them, because you might have 
a mechanical engineering 
company squished between 
Apple and Microsoft,” Mc-
Quoid said. “We’re trying to 
be aware and responsive to all 
sorts of different concerns.”
TOC organizers will also 
keep a head count of students 
in the gym at all times during 
the event, capping the num-
ber of students allowed in at 
once to prevent overcrowding.

Earlier  in September, 
Carnegie Mellon profes-
sor and practicing mate-
rials scientist Jay Whita-
cre was awarded the 
prestigious Lemelson-MIT 
Prize of $500,000. The award 
is given to inventors whose 
creations are designed to im-
prove the world.
In Whitacre’s case, this 
invention is the Aqueous Hy-
brid ion battery, which is an 
“environmentally-benign and 
cost-ef?cient energy stor-
age system,” according to a 
university press release.
The battery is intended 
for use in a combination of 
solar and wind energy sys-
tems, and was developed 
using sustainable resources. 
Whitacre’s company, Aquion 
Energy, has full manufactur-
ing and marketing capability, 
which will allow for world-
wide distribution. One of the 
greatest challenges Whitacre 
faced was creating a stor-
age system that did not rely 
on the presence of wind or 
sunlight.  What makes the 
battery groundbreaking is its 
ability to function as an ener-
gy source day-and-night.
This invention is far from 
Whitacre’s inaugural contri-
bution to his ?eld: he holds 
over 30 patents and pending 
patents, and has published 
more than 60 papers. 
In addition to his contri-
butions directly to the Carn-
egie Mellon Community, 
Whitacre has been highly ac-
tive in the greater Pittsburgh 
area, through his company’s 
involvement in multiple pro-
grams aimed at developing 
student engineers.
With a portion of his prize 
money, Whitacre plans to 
support and encourage grad-
uate students who have an 
interest in pioneering energy 
solutions.

Carnegie Mellon, City of Pittsburgh help create new network to address challenges
In an effort to confront 
local challenges, Carnegie 
Mellon University and the 
City of Pittsburgh have com-
bined forces. Using a $1 mil-
lion grant, the duo plans to 
create the “MetroLab Net-
work” — a national union 
that includes 20 urban ar-
eas and their neighboring 
universities. The goal is to 
develop and distribute new 
technologies that will tackle 
vital problems in these areas.
The $1 million grant, cour-
tesy of the John D. and Cath-
erine T. Macarthur founda-
tion, will be used toward the 
cost of hiring administrative 
personnel, including an ex-
ecutive director.
According to a univer-
sity press release, University 
Provost Farnam Jahanian 
commented, “In the spirit 
of collaboration, Carnegie 
Mellon is excited to take a 
leading role in the founding 
of the MetroLab Network. 
This effort builds on de-
cades of research supported 
by federal agencies, private 
foundations, and industry 
collaboration to create solu-
tions that improve urban ar-
eas and provide real bene?ts 
to the public. We are eager to 
participate and work togeth-
er with the other members of 
the network to develop and 
deploy technologies capable 
of creating a brighter future 
for our cities.”
The network will use data 
and various information 
technologies to understand 
how major cities work, and 
then apply this information 
to better them. The involved 
universities possess the tech-
nological knowledge to ap-
ply the research, while the 
urban areas will serve as 
real-life trial grounds.
The city will function as 
an “urban lab,” according to 
Pittsburgh Mayor William 
Peduto. The MetroLab Net-
work is modeled off many 
prior successes, including 
multiple Carnegie Mellon 
contributions to the Pitts-
burgh area.

innovation within their ?elds.
Moore spoke about ques-
tion and answer systems, the 
systems that humans use to 
answer questions. He said 
that within the past few years, 
the ?eld has undergone an ex-
treme change as humans turn 
more and more frequently to 
their cell phones to answer 
questions rather than relying 
on desktop systems. 
As the technology adapts, 
said Moore, humans will in-
creasingly turn to their ma-
chines to answer questions 
that require intimate details 
about the inquirer — for ex-
ample, knowing what medi-
cine to take, or knowing what 
building the machine is in so 
that it can call the front desk 
for the user.
In Krishnan’s portion of 
the panel, he addressed in-
novative manufacturing, and 
how to move from point solu-
tions to platforms by way of 
policy. 
Krishnan emphasized that 
this innovative manufactur-
ing trend would be key in 
helping move manufacturing 
jobs back to the United States. 
In closing, the three deans 
emphasized that rather than 
considering the crossover 
between technology, innova-
tion, and business — a dan-
gerous trend that will likely 
put white collar workers out 
of a job —the United States 
in particular should be opti-
mistic about options for the 
future. 
This is true especially in 
Pittsburgh, where the tech 
industry is growing by the 
day. Tech companies are 
making the city more and 
more of a hub for global en-
trepreneurship and business 
management solutions.
Tepper School of Business 
Dean Bob Dammon empha-
sized how important it is for 
Carnegie Mellon to be at the 
forefront of these ?elds and 
how thankful he is for the CBI 
to allow it to be forging the 
path in creating leaders for 
a complex world. Dammon 
called Carnegie Mellon, and 
particularly the CBI, the place 
where the new trends in busi-
ness, technology, and data 
converge.
“Carnegie Mellon is com-
fortable with change be-
cause we are often the agents 
of that change,” Dammon 
said. “We are in a unique, 
good position.”
cess to world-class education. 
This privilege, however, and 
the desire to take advantage 
of it, is rare in the modern 
United States; according to 
the latest ?gures by the Atlan-
tic, only a third of 27 year-old 
citizens in the United States 
have an undergraduate bach-
elor’s degree or higher.
Duncan’s lecture plays into 
a national conversation on 
how to improve the state of 
US education, and the litany 
of available but underused 
education resources. 
Pittsburgh public school 
superintendent Linda Lane 
noted just how important 
Advanced Placement (AP) 
exams are for high school stu-
dents, and how this resource 
has been underutilized for a 
long time. Over the last ?ve 
years, AP exam participation 
in the Pittsburgh area has in-
creased by 49 percent, and 
the African-American student 
participation increased by 
220 percent. These impres-
sive numbers received an 
enthusiastic applause from 
the audience. AP exams have 
been shown to be a substan-
tial indicator of high school 
success, and Pittsburgh’s 
rates are moving in the right 
direction.
One audience member 
noted that tests are an impor-
tant factor for assessing our 
knowledge, but it is important 
to note that they are certainly 
not the only measurements 
of our intelligence — simply 
a major factor that is easy to 
measure. 
Other factors, such as chil-
dren’s attendance rate, their 
interaction with others, and 
their cooperation in and out-
side of the classroom, should 
also be taken into consider-
ation when assessing a child, 
Lane said.
No discussion of education 
can avoid the topic of teach-
ers. According to Secretary 
Duncan, three key features 
should be instilled in all teach-
ers: knowledge of the content 
they are teaching, a heart full 
of compassion for their kids, 
and cultural competency. This 
was in response to a question 
about the immigrant popula-
tion at certain schools.
“Teachers should re?ect 
the diversity of our nation’s 
students, and our nation’s stu-
dents today are majority mi-
nority,” Duncan said. Accord-
ing to him, teachers should 
be able to teach all children, 
no matter their culture, back-
ground, or state of being. 
Without these wide-ranging 
perspectives, certain children 
bene?t more than others.
One of the major mile-
stones of a good education is 
graduation. High school grad-
uation is usually considered a 
day signifying freedom, adult-
hood, and independence — a 
very memorable day for some 
people.
It is often viewed as fail-
ure in the United States if 
a student does not achieve 
enough to get to this point, 
but high school graduation 
does not have to be the end 
of their educational journey. 
“You can’t just drop kids off 
at graduation and hope they 
make it to postsecondary 
[school] if they told you they 
were going,” Lane said.
Lane believes that parents 
shouldn’t remove themselves 
from their children’s lives and 
and hope for the best at this 
point. If anything, this is a 
time when young adults need 
support and guidance more 
than ever.
Many amazing things can 
come out of teamwork and 
collaboration, and these are 
believed to be two necessary 
components to improving ed-
ucation in America. Secretary 
Duncan and his guests are 
prime examples of teachers 
who have put an incredible 
amount of time and energy 
into their students’ education.
We are a part of a country 
that is always looking forward, 
and it is through the qual-
ity education of our younger 
people that we will achieve 
extraordinary things, knowing 
that the next generations will 
be prepared to continue the 
journey we leave behind.
Farr said.

erson help the company estab-
lish presence and strengthen 
its position in new markets. 
Historically, this was not a 
problem, as Emerson sur-
passed the S&P 500 in terms 
of economic growth, but the 
company has been shrink-
ing signi?cantly since 2014. 
Farr was therefore forced to 
change his business strategy 
and worked with his board to 
adjust the company. 
Adjusting the structure 
was complicated, because 
Farr could not base Emer-
son’s business model on glob-
al economic growth. 
Currently, global ?xed 
income and worldwide eco-
nomic growth is decreasing. 
Farr therefore strategically 
shrunk his company to bet-
ter suit the market. He cut 
the company down from a 
$24.5 billion franchise to 
one of $16.3 billion, and Em-
erson consequently experi-
enced a 2.4 percent increase 
in sales growth. Today, as 
a result of his strategic ac-
tions, Emerson is showing 
excellent growth. Farr went 
on to explain other strategic 
changes he implemented in 
his business model to ensure 
growth, and how the man-
agement held the company’s 
high position in the market. 
Mid-tier markets in Russia 
and India offer profitable 
opportunities for Emerson, 
Farr said. Emerson was once 
a very strong company in 
China, but other competing 
local companies started to 
form and take over some of 
the market. 
Therefore, Farr was 
forced to change Emerson’s 
market strategies or disap-
pear completely from China’s 
market. He employed new 
strategies that would tie 
down the company’s upper 
tier and grow in the mid tier, 
thus keeping their position 
in the high tier and enabling 
Emerson to compete with 
other mid tiers.
Farr believes that to be a 
CEO, you must demonstrate 
that you can indeed be a 
leader and induce positive 
changes for a company. Be-
fore he became Emerson’s 
CEO, Farr urged the com-
pany to expand to Asia given 
the global economic changes 
that were occurring at this 
time. Now, Emerson still 
holds a strong position in the 
Asian market.
“To be a CEO, you have to 
make an impact, you need 
to demonstrate that you can 
make something big hap-
pen, not just sit behind a 
desk,” Farr said. Farr himself 
exhibits strong leadership 
and willingness to better 
his company for the future, 
concluding by saying, “I was 
given the keys to make this a 
better company for the next 
CEO.”

Ahmed shows hope in ?ght against U.S. Islamophobia 
Last Monday, Ahmed Mohamed, 
a 14-year-old high school fresh-
man, brought his homemade clock 
to school to show to his teachers. 
Rather than praising Mohamed for 
his work, his teachers noti?ed the 
school of a safety threat. Mohamed 
was arrested, led out of his school 
in handcuffs, and sent to a juvenile 
detention center for bringing a “hoax 
bomb” to school.
Although it may be surprising to 
hear that a 14-year-old student was 
arrested for building a clock, it’s un-
fortunately not as surprising to hear 
that a boy named Ahmed Mohamed 
was arrested for that reason. Ahmed 
Mohamed is one of many Muslims 
in the United States who have been 
treated wrongfully due to wide-
spread Islamophobia.
What happened to Mohamed is 
sad and discouraging. In a world 
where a 13-year-old non-Muslim 
white boy can build a nuclear fusion 
reactor with the support and funding 
from his school, and “raise the bar 
for what young teens can pull off,” 
according to CNET, we shouldn’t let 
fear hold us back. Mohamed’s case is 
an important step is recognizing our 
own biases and fears.
It is encouraging, however, to 
see some of the responses on social 
media supporting Mohamed. Some 
of the biggest names in tech have 
reached out and showed support, 
including experts from NASA’s Jet 
Propulsion Lab, Reddit’s co-founder 
Alexis Ohanian, and Facebook’s 
Mark Zuckerberg. The President of 
the United States himself tweeted an 
invitation for Mohamed to visit the 
White House.
The outpouring of support in re-
sponse to Ahmed Mohamed’s arrest 
shows some hope for reducing and 
eliminating irrational fears of Mus-
lims, which slow and sometimes 
even prevent progress. As Hillary 
Clinton said on Twitter, “Assump-
tions and fear don’t keep us safe — 
they hold us back. Ahmed, stay curi-
ous and keep building.”
Sanders’ appeal to Evangelicals crosses party lines 
Last week, presidential hopeful 
Senator Bernie Sanders (I–VT) — 
Jew, socialist, and staunch liberal 
— became the ?rst democratic can-
didate in years to speak at Liberty 
University, the largest and most fa-
mous Evangelical Christian school in 
America.
In his speech, Sanders frankly 
acknowledged the many ideological 
differences between himself and his 
audience. “It is very easy for those 
in politics to talk to those who agree 
with us,” he said, “It is harder, but 
not less important, to try to commu-
nicate with those who do not agree 
with us.”
Despite the fact that the aver-
age Liberty student would be horri-
?ed by his support for reproductive 
freedom and same-sex marriage, 
Sanders strayed from today’s strictly 
partisan politics and sought common 
ground with those who would be his 
adversaries.
To emphasize the need for greater 
income equality, he cited the Bible’s 
famous “Golden Rule”: “So in every-
thing, do to others what you would 
have them do to you.”
“When we talk about moral-
ity, and when we talk about justice,” 
Sanders said, “we have to, in my 
view, understand that there is no 
justice when so few have so much, 
and so many have so little.” Jesus, 
according to Sanders, would be very 
far from an American Republican 
capitalist.
By speaking to them in their own 
language, Sanders tried to reach the 
people most likely to disagree with 
him. Though such an appeal would 
realistically be hopeless, it’s encour-
aging to see a presidential candidate 
willing to cross the harshest of party 
lines. Sanders’ visit to Liberty may 
have been strategic. 
Even if he doesn’t convert a single 
Evangelical to his side, his cross-par-
ty appeal was just the right kind of 
admirable to attract more moderate 
supporters.
It seems that most politicians to-
day prefer to villainize and slander 
their opposition rather than cooper-
ate for the common good. Sanders, 
as he has exempli?ed throughout his 
campaign, has shown himself to not 
be the standard candidate America 
has grown to tolerate. America needs 
politicians like Sanders to create a 
balanced, progressive government.
CMU fails to beat Ivy competitors on tuition, salary 
The Department of Education 
recently unveiled a new website 
that gives over 7,000 colleges in the 
United States an individual, detailed 
scorecard. The website, which can be 
reached at https://collegescorecard.
ed.gov/, ful?lls President Barack 
Obama’s long-running effort to rank 
every college in America.
On the site, the Department of 
Education shows detailed data about 
each college and university, includ-
ing the average annual cost, gradua-
tion rate, and salary after attending. 
Although the data is based only on 
students who have received federal 
loans in order to pay for their higher 
education, the Obama administra-
tion’s economists say that the data is 
generalizable. The trove of data is a 
valuable tool for seeing at-a-glance 
information about any U.S. college 
or university.
The scorecard site also high-
lights many of the problems with 
the American system of higher edu-
cation. Students of one of the eight 
Ivy League universities, for example, 
out-earn students at almost any 
other university. Harvard University 
graduates, for example, paid an av-
erage of $14,049 a year to attend the 
elite university and made, on aver-
age, $87,200 annually upon gradua-
tion. The Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) boasts the highest 
return of any U.S. college; students 
at MIT pay on average $21,816 to at-
tend and make $91,600 a year after 
graduating.
At Carnegie Mellon, students 
pay an average of $33,386 a year 
and make $72,00 a year when they 
graduate. These numbers are, by 
any metric, impressive, and well 
above the national average post-
college graduation starting salary of 
$45,478. Still, we don’t stack up with 
MIT, a school we consider our “peer 
institution.” At Stanford University, 
too — another peer institution — 
students pay less than half as much 
to attend than students at Carnegie 
Mellon ($15,713), and make more 
upon graduation ($80,900).
The disparity demonstrates that 
Carnegie Mellon lags behind its 
peers with regards to its ?nancial aid 
policy. The university should strive 
to help more students afford a world-
class Carnegie Mellon education by 
bringing down the average cost of 
attendance to match that of schools 
like Stanford, MIT, and Harvard.
University President Subra Suresh 
is taking a step in the right direction 
with the newly-minted Presidential 
Scholars and Presidential Fellows 
program, but it’s not enough. The 
administration needs to leverage our 
growing endowment to make ?nan-
cial aid a priority, and make Carn-
egie Mellon a true peer institution 
of some of the most well-respected 
universities in the country.

Pointing ?ngers won’t solve refugee disaster
JENNIFER TUTTLE
Junior Staffwriter
In the past year, over 200,000 
refugees from Syria — which is be-
ing torn apart by the extremist or-
ganization ISIS — entered the Eu-
ropean Union by way of Hungary. 
Last Tuesday, Hungary closed its 
borders, making it illegal and almost 
impossible to enter the country.
It’s easy to look at Hungary and 
criticize its response to the crisis. 
From the beginning, Hungary hasn’t 
seemed too willing to help refugees 
escape from the horrors of their 
home country.
Last week, the trains that were 
supposed to take refugees from Bu-
dapest to Austria or Germany were 
delayed and rerouted, even after the 
refugees had already spent days liv-
ing in the station with little access 
to necessities like clean water, food, 
or diapers. The media has been 
dominated by now-infamous scenes 
of Hungarian military personnel 
throwing sandwiches into a crowd 
of migrants and police clashes with 
migrant families.
A Hungarian camerawoman 
seemed to encapsulate the national 
feeling towards the refugees when 
she kicked and tripped refugees 
running across the border while 
?lming a segment. Overwhelming-
ly, it seems that Hungary does not 
view these people as people, but as 
animals.
There is an obvious problem with 
how Hungary and many Hungarians 
have been treating the migrants, 
but the hard truth of the matter is 
that Hungary simply does not have 
the infrastructure and organiza-
tion to deal with the crisis. Hungary 
is a relatively new member to the 
European Union (EU). It joined in 
2004 with the promise of a vibrant, 
booming economy and better insti-
tutional organization, as well as the 
protection and support of other EU 
nations. So far, those promises have 
been slow to come to fruition.
When thousands of refugees be-
gan appearing, Hungary simply was 
not prepared to run an organized 
operation. Its transit system could 
not handle the amount of people 
that were ?ooding it, not to mention 
the tricky business of maneuvering 
enough trains to reach Austria and 
Germany. In a perfect world, Hun-
gary would have been able to help. 
Unfortunately, we do not live in a 
perfect world.
Meanwhile in Germany, Syrian 
refugees were greeted with cheers, 
candy, and gifts from onlookers. 
The world was ?ooded with hope 
that perhaps refugees would be able 
to ?nd a place that would welcome 
them with open arms. Germany 
had answered the call and criticized 
Hungary for its barbarism.
Austria welcomed many refugees 
as well, and France has pledged to 
take on 24,000. It may seem that 
once again, the founders of the Eu-
ropean Union have acted as saviors 
for the rest.
In reality, however, the top EU 
nations are taking this as another 
opportunity to point ?ngers at East-
ern Europe while doing very little 
themselves. Germany can easily 
look like a haven when it is the last 
destination for many refugees. Ref-
ugees in Germany have arrived at 
slower rates and many have already 
received emergency medical aid 
and food from less well-equipped 
nations.
However, even Germany has now 
decided to close itself to Syrian refu-
gees, imposing border controls that 
are a rarity in the European Union. 
The “Willkommenskultur”, or “open 
arms policy” that Syrian refugees 
were promised once they reached 
Germany is no longer. 
Meanwhile, Austria and the 
Netherlands — two nations with 
plenty of available resources — have 
also closed their borders, making it 
even harder for refugees to traverse 
Europe and reach a safety.
The United Kingdom has, until 
very recently, ignored all calls for 
help from Syrian refugees and the 
rest of Europe. Its only meager re-
sponse came in early September, 
promising to offer asylum to 4,000 
Syrian refugees per year until 2020. 
British Prime Minister David Cam-
eron displayed a shocking lack of 
knowledge about the circumstances 
of the current Syrian crisis when he 
urged migrants to stop risking their 
lives by traveling to Europe and in-
stead wait to be placed in Middle 
Eastern refugee camps.
Syrians cannot wait. They surely 
know the risks when undertaking 
this journey, but they have decided 
that the chance for a better life is 
well worth the risk of death, espe-
cially compared to the violent chaos 
in their homeland.
In lieu of developing a better 
strategy to handle the crisis, the 
countries of the European Union 
have fallen to blaming and criticiz-
ing each other. Germany criticizes 
the United Kingdom for not getting 
heavily involved; the United King-
dom accuses Germany of not being 
realistic about how many refugees 
to whom they can offer asylum; Aus-
tria criticizes Hungary and Croatia 
for not doing more to organize the 
refugees when they ?rst reach the 
EU. Germany closes its border, sup-
posedly to handle the organization 
of people currently in the country, 
but in reality as an effort to force 
other nations to take more refugees. 
The entire world criticizes Hungary 
for collapsing under the systematic 
pressure and chaos.
Criticizing and blaming each 
other will never work. If the Euro-
pean Union hopes to truly offer Syr-
ian refugees a new home and a new 
hope for the future, they must band 
together and cooperate.

A PERSON’S OPINION
September 21, 2015 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A5
The Tartan is happy to welcome its new aspiring journalists this week. So we asked,
What news source do you use most frequently?
Compiled by Sarah Gutekunst
Iran nuclear deal will work; N. Korea’s did
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Last Tuesday, North Korea 
claimed to once again begin expand-
ing its nuclear arsenal. North Korea 
has had nuclear weapons for some 
time, and its possession of these 
weapons is often presented as a neg-
ative test case for nuclear deals with 
“rogue states,” such as Iran.
A quick look into the history, 
however, reveals that the opposite 
is true. The Agreed Framework, 
the nuclear deal former president 
Bill Clinton made with North Ko-
rea, actually prevented the birth of 
a nuclear North Korea until former 
president George W. Bush let the 
deal collapse toward the beginning 
of his presidency.
The Agreed Framework-based 
counterargument to the Iran Deal 
is compelling but improbable; the 
Iran Deal is unlike the failed Agreed 
Framework in that there are key dif-
ferences between the deals and po-
litical situations in North Korea and 
Iran.
First, the collapse of the North 
Korean deal had little to do with the 
deal itself and everything to do with 
American inaction. In North Korea, 
the United States had an active role 
in the deal. However, because many 
were skeptical of North Korea’s 
faithfulness to the terms, the U.S. 
slacked on energy shipments.
Meanwhile, the Iran Deal only 
gives the United States a say in when 
to inspect Iran’s nuclear facilities. 
Since this deal is easier for the U.S., 
it will not collapse based entirely on 
America’s skepticism.
Secondly, North Korea has a 
very strong central government that 
heavily controls ?ow of information. 
This information comes from Amer-
ican intelligence, so take it with a 
grain of salt, but it does seem that 
North Koreans generally have less 
will for diplomacy and often view 
their government as infallible.
In Iran, meanwhile, there exists a 
real desire to connect with the West. 
There is also evidence that, despite 
American conceptions, the Iranian 
government actually is quite re-
sponsive to the people. The image of 
Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif 
reaching out a sunroof to high-?ve 
throngs of thrilled citizens is stun-
ning. The political engagement of 
citizens will empower moderates in 
the Iranian government, which will 
turn the country from a militaristic 
rogue state into a nation eager to 
improve conditions within its own 
borders.
Finally, the Agreed Framework 
did what it set out to do; it pre-
vented North Korea from attaining 
nuclear weapons. Though North Ko-
rea publicly ?irted with the idea of 
bombastically violating the deal, its 
?rst nuclear tests did not occur until 
after the deal crumbled.
Much more so than Iran, North 
Korea has long been a state inclined 
toward nuclear ambitions and 
cheating on deals. But America’s 
offer to help with North Korea’s se-
vere energy problem was enough of 
a carrot to hold the country to that 
deal’s terms. In the same way, the 
Iran deal will lift the sanctions that 
have restricted Iran’s economy and 
infrastructure for 40 years, motivat-
ing the Iranian government to keep 
their end of the deal. 
While it is disconcerting that 
North Korea may restart nuclear 
tests, it is important to remember 
that American diplomacy once 
had that under control. China has 
strongly condemned the possibility 
of North Korean nuclear testing and 
will likely exert enough pressure 
to keep anything meaningful from 
coming of North Korea’s announce-
ment, but the message remains the 
same. Diplomacy is a powerful tool. 
The Agreed Framework served its 
purpose, and it is time to give the 
Iran Deal a shot to do the same.

Google’s having an identity crisis
NAVIYA SINGLA
Junior Staffwriter
What’s round, lazy, and hang-
ing out at a weird angle? No, it’s 
not a sloth. It’s the “e” at the end 
of Google’s new logo. It is trying so 
hard to stand out that it sticks out 
like a tomato in a bowl of fruit (un-
less you’re a biologist, of course!).
According to the Harvard Busi-
ness Review, “A company’s brand 
identity (who you are) and brand im-
age (who people think you are) need 
to be in sync.” Google has not done 
that. The new logo does not repre-
sent the way that Google is perceived 
by the masses. The company gave up 
its distinctive serif typeface for a ge-
neric sans serif and an “e” that kow-
tows to the former logo.
The original serif Catull BQ stood 
for sophistication and innovation, 
professionalism and playfulness. The 
new font, “Product Sans,” is not bad, 
but it’s just that — not bad. However, 
it has lost its cutting-edge brilliance 
to a softer, rounder, play-school 
style, which makes it extraordinarily 
ordinary. Even if you prefer the aes-
thetic of sans serif over the previous 
font, the desperate “e” should still 
not be excused.
Like all logos, Google’s has a 
story. Is it a bigger metaphor for re-
branding the company? Rebranding 
was Google’s chance to come up with 
a dramatic, abstract logo for its om-
nipresent brand. 
Is the schoolbook-style font meta-
phorically suggesting that Google is 
a child once again? Is the logo con-
nected to a future growth plan? Is it 
an apathetic response to aggressive 
media scrutiny?
The most cited story is that the 
logo had to be reinvented to ?t small-
er screens. Yes, sans serifs use fewer 
pixels than serifs. But screen resolu-
tions are increasing at a phenomenal 
rate. If pixel usage is Google’s only 
concern, then there is de?nitely a 
lack of foresight on its design board.
“We think we’ve taken the best of 
Google (simple, uncluttered, color-
ful, friendly), and recast it not just 
for the Google of today, but for the 
Google of the future,” said Google in 
its of?cial press release. Between the 
new logo and its new holding com-
pany Alphabet, Google seems to have 
lost its identity.
Made to absorb Google’s sub-
sidiary companies and refocus 
Google’s area of scope, Alphabet also 
seems to have in?uenced Google’s 
individuality. 
While Alphabet clearly implies 
the hierarchical relationship be-
tween the companies, it doesn’t set 
any boundaries between them. Ex-
cept for the color scheme, their logos 
look practically the same. It’s boring.
The sudden focus on simplic-
ity and clarity sounds too similar to 
Apple’s “Simplicity is Sophistication” 
theme. Switching out a serif font for 
a sans serif? Apple did that in 2002 
for the sake of clarity, simplicity, and 
pixel count. Sounds familiar, doesn’t 
it?
Google is supposed to embody in-
tellectual dynamism and quirkiness, 
but its logo suggests an unassertive 
attempt at replacing the previous 
logo. Product Sans? More like prod-
uct sans effort.
“The serif Catull BQ stood for sophistication and innovation, 
professionalism and playfulness. The new front, “Product 
Sans,” is not bad, but it’s just that  — not bad. However, it has 
lost its cutting-edge brilliance to a softer, rounder, play-school 
style, which makes it extraordinarily ordinary.”

Government must protect data privacy under Bill of Rights
BRANDON SCHMUCK
It’s a bit ironic to think that tech-
nology companies are now providing 
security on our devices to protect us 
from an organization that calls itself 
the National Security Agency. How-
ever, with each day it becomes more 
clear that the interests of the govern-
ment and the people have come into 
con?ict.
The government has decided that 
the Bill of Rights no longer applies 
to the Digital Age. This sentiment 
is beginning to trickle down to law 
enforcement organizations that now 
desire more data than ever for use in 
investigations. 
Since this trend will clearly 
continue to grow, it is time for com-
panies to bring back privacy to their 
customers and ensure that encryp-
tion remains the key of freedom.
The problem with most forms of 
encryption is that they come with a 
key that is easily accessible by those 
in law enforcement and government 
organizations. However, companies 
like Apple are ?nally beginning to put 
down their foot.
Since iOS 8, Apple has made it 
impossible to comply with law en-
forcement requests by storing en-
cryption keys, associated with device 
pass-codes, locally on user devices. 
Though this makes it essentially im-
possible for Apple to unlock a device 
for a customer, it’s equally dif?cult 
for the company to unlock a device 
for someone in law enforcement.
According to Apple’s page on 
privacy, 94 percent of law enforce-
ment requests to Apple are device 
requests, while only 6 percent are ac-
count requests. 
This shows the true need for en-
cryption. Law enforcement of?cials 
should not be able to access your 
entire digital life through a single 
request. If an investigation needs to 
be made, law enforcement requests 
should be limited to individual ac-
counts or subsets of customer data.
As technology becomes a more in-
tegral part of our everyday lives, the 
need for privacy becomes more cru-
cial than ever. Credit cards, ?nger-
prints, health data, personal photos, 
bank accounts, location data, and 
other personal information now ?ll 
our devices.
If full access is given to a user’s 
mobile device, the user can essen-
tially be monitored at every moment 
by those holding the key. Because 
smartphones are now global, the 
threat that governments could take 
advantage of this has never been 
greater. Pro?ling and tracking of citi-
zens is an extremely scary thing.
Wearables bring forth even larger 
issues. Unwarranted access to wear-
ables would give law enforcement the 
ability track the heart rate and health 
data of users. This could provide of-
?cials with a broad-strokes picture of 
users’ emotions, stress level, and how 
they are spending their days. It ?lls 
me with fear to think of what some-
one could do if they had a backdoor 
to the password combination of both 
my iPhone and smartwatch.
While most of?cers have good 
intentions, it is inevitable that some 
will not. If law enforcement of?cers 
had backdoor methods of obtaining 
customer data, they could create so-
cial graphs of users and use them for 
discrimination. By pro?ling users, 
they could make assumptions about 
them based on race, class, or social 
connections; their privacy and free-
doms would certainly be violated.
For most people, the operations of 
encryption happen on their devices 
without their awareness; programs 
such as FileVault on Mac are being 
presented more commonly to the 
user as the default option.
Some companies have made leaps 
to protect customer data, and this 
should not be supplanted by any 
government body. People would riot 
the streets if they had to give a key to 
their house to law enforcement. But 
for some reason, the idea of giving a 
key to their encrypted data has not 
yet ?lled them with the same fear.

“Just keep swimming” in CMU ocean
SYDNEY ROSLIN
Junior Staffwriter
Hello! I am the Carnegie Mellon 
University Class of 2019+. In high 
school, I was a pretty big deal.
I had stellar grades, for one, and 
I aced all of my standardized tests. I 
was valedictorian and student body 
president, captain of a varsity sports 
team and lead in the school musi-
cal. I started clubs, service organiza-
tions, and even my own company. I 
wrote for the school newspaper, cre-
ated my own app, held a variety of 
internships, wrote research papers, 
and took service trips to every corner 
of the globe. 
On top of all that, I still found 
time for an active social life. I am in-
telligent, creative, and hard working 
— a perfectionist, overachiever, and 
role model in my community. How-
ever, I am beginning to realize that I 
am not alone.
I look at my fellow students, and I 
see people who are just like me. They 
too were leaders in their high schools 
and standouts in their hometowns. 
They are incredible and intimidat-
ing, and it seems that they share all 
of the qualities that have set me apart 
up until this point. My achievements 
thus far no longer make me special. I 
am just one more face in the crowd.
It can be dif?cult coming to a 
university like Carnegie Mellon. A 
person can simply look at decades’ 
worth of successful alumni, re-
nowned professors who are leaders 
in their ?elds, and current students 
with incredible achievements to 
know that this is a hub for innovation 
and academic success. 
While this provides amazing op-
portunities for students and staff, 
it can also feel overwhelming for 
someone new to campus. While ?rst-
years are used to being leaders — 
the big ?sh in their respective small 
ponds — they are now swimming 
with thousands of other big ?sh in 
what feels like an ocean. They are 
newcomers once again, adjusting 
to a culture much more competitive 
and intense than what they have pre-
viously encountered.
In an environment such as this, 
it can be easy to lie low and ?y un-
der the radar. Why should a person 
try to stand out, be at the top of the 
class, lead an organization, or create 
something new when there always 
seems to be someone around the 
corner who could do better? What’s 
the point in trying to be special when 
you know that everyone around you 
is already special? 
Wouldn’t it just be easier to try to 
simply pass and graduate on time? 
After all, standing out at Carnegie 
Mellon takes an incredible amount 
of hard work, and even then, you 
might still be counted as just another 
overachiever. Is that worth the stress 
and self-doubt?
Sure, aiming for average is an op-
tion. It is not, however, the option 
that any Carnegie Mellon student 
once took in order to be admitted 
here. There is so much brilliance, 
talent, and passion at this univer-
sity that average is the last thing that 
comes to mind when thinking about 
it. 
Tartans are not built to be average. 
We are hardwired to push boundar-
ies, make new discoveries, and grow 
as both scholars and people.
So instead of aiming for average 
individually, I propose that we aim 
for greatness together. Yes, your 
peers may be smarter than you. They 
may be more talented than you, and 
they may have better ideas than you. 
Instead of resigning yourself to stand 
in their shadows, however, learn 
from them. Work with them. 
Even though you may feel inferior 
to those around you, remember that 
you are here for a reason — just like 
them. Allow them to push you to im-
prove whatever it is you came here to 
do. 
After all, there is no room to grow 
in a small pond, but when you have 
the ocean to explore, the possibilities 
are endless. We have been granted 
this incredible opportunity to sur-
round ourselves with extraordinary 
people. 
Take advantage of the resources 
given to you in your fellow students. 
They are not your adversaries, and 
their success will not diminish your 
own. Rather, their success can in-
spire you, encourage you, and teach 
you.
Hello! I am the Carnegie Mellon 
University Class of 2019+. I worked 
hard to get here, and I know that ev-
eryone else at this school worked as 
much as I did to get here as well. I am 
not alone. 
I look at my fellow students and 
see people who are just like me — 
passionate, smart, and motivated 
people whose hearts are in the work 
and who inspire me each and every 
day to be my best self. Together, we 
will push each other toward common 
success.
“Tartans are not built to be average. We are hardwired to push

Ultrathin invisibility cloak created on a microscopic level
Researchers from the 
US Department of Energy’s 
Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory and the Univer-
sity of California Berkeley 
have created an ultrathin in-
visibility cloak that conforms 
to the shape of an object and 
conceals it from visible light 
detection. The cloak works 
by rerouting re?ected light 
waves away from the object 
so that the object cannot be 
optically detected when the 
cloak is activated. 
Currently, the cloak is mi-
croscopic in size, but the the-
ory behind the cloak should 
enable it to be scaled up in the 
future. This technology could 
eventually be used for micro-
scopes, computers, or securi-
ty purposes. The researchers 
published their ?ndings in a 
paper entitled “An Ultra-Thin 
Invisibility Skin Cloak for Vis-
ible Light” in Science.

Mathematical model predicts tsunami height quickly
After the 8.3-magnitude 
earthquake off the coast of 
Chile on September 16, more 
than 1 million Chileans were 
evacuated due to tsunami 
concerns. After the earth-
quake data was received, re-
searchers were able to predict 
the height of the incoming 
tsunami using mathematical 
estimates of how earthquakes 
trigger tsunamis.
The researchers state that 
their method allows them 
to predict accurate tsunami 
forecasts in half the time as 
the current method, which 
would dispatch emergency 
resources much more quickly 
to areas in the most need. The 
researchers hope this will de-
crease the overall devestation 
caused by earthquakes and 
tsunamis. 
They plan to publish a pa-
per in Journal of Geophysical 
Research: Solid Earth.

Rapid, recent decline in ocean’s wildlife populations
A new World Wildlife 
Fund report revealed a rapid 
decline in the ocean’s wildlife 
populations in the past few 
decades. Their Living Blue 
Planet report found that pop-
ulations of marine vertebrates 
have declined by 49 percent 
between 1970 and 2012, with 
some ?sh species declining by 
almost 75 percent.
The report also states that 
the most prominent reasons 
for this decline are over?sh-
ing, habitat destruction, and 
climate change. “The good 
news is there are abundant 
opportunities to reverse these 
trends,” said Brad Ack, senior 
vice president for oceans at 
WWF. “Stopping black market 
?shing, protecting … critical 
ocean habitats, and striking 
a deal in Paris to slash car-
bon pollution are all good for 
the ocean, the economy, and 
people.”

Top iPhone ad-blocking app pulled from app store
This week, Marco Arment, 
the creator of the Peace app, 
pulled his ad-blocking ap-
plication for iPhones from 
the App Store amidst its rag-
ing success. After its release 
on Wednesday, the $2.99 
app jumped to the top of the 
charts since it blocks adver-
tisements from popping up 
when users use the Safari web 
browser.
“Achieving this much suc-
cess with Peace just doesn’t 
feel good, which I didn’t an-
ticipate,” says Arment. In 
general, ad-block disrupts the 
way a website makes money, 
since websites often offer free 
content and service in ex-
change for running ads. “Ad 
blockers come with an impor-
tant asterisk: while they do 
bene?t a ton of people in ma-
jor ways, they also hurt some, 
including many who don’t de-
serve the hit.”

Sound waves used to activate brain cells in worm model
For the ?rst time, scientists 
were able to directly control 
a lab worm’s brain cells us-
ing sound waves. They used 
ultrasound to target speci?c 
neurons in order to make the 
worm change direction, and 
in order to amplify the sound, 
the worm was bathed in tiny 
bubbles.
The researchers reported 
their non-invasive way of con-
trolling brain cells in the jour-
nal Nature Communications, 
and stated that it could help 
improve optogenetics, which 
uses light instead of sound. 
This could bene?ts neurosci-
ence in particular. Since light 
cannot penetrate through 
tissue, “this could be a big 
advantage when you want to 
stimulate a region deep in the 
brain,” said Stuart Ibsen, one 
of the study’s authors from 
California’s Salk Institute for 
Biological Studies.

Researchers develop potential animal IQ test with robins
It is dif?cult to measure 
animal IQ because it’s dif?cult 
to design tests that measure 
overall intelligence instead of 
speci?c skill and the results 
largely depend on how moti-
vated an animal is to perform. 
A team led by Rachael 
Shaw, an animal behavior re-
searcher at Victoria Univer-
sity of Wellington, began ex-
periments with New Zealand 
North Island robins to see if 
they could administer a suc-
cessful test.
In a paper published online 
this week in Animal Behav-
iour, Shaw and her colleagues 
reported their results of how 
well the birds did when given 
proper motivation. They found 
a weak but positive correlation 
between how well a robin did 
on one test compared to its 
performance on all tests.

New biomaterial offers orthopedic bene?ts
SHARON WU
Staffwriter
Stefanie A. Sydlik, a Carne-
gie Mellon alumnus, spoke last 
Tuesday as part of a seminar 
series hosted by the biomedi-
cal engineering department at 
Carnegie Mellon University. In 
front of a packed audience in 
a classroom in Doherty Hall, 
Sydlik discussed her extensive 
research in polymer science, 
materials chemistry, biomate-
rials, and electronic materials. 
During her presentation, she 
also introduced a biomaterial 
that may hold the key to cre-
ating new orthopedic materi-
als, implants and devices that 
could help advance the ?eld of 
orthopedics.
Sydlik was an under-
graduate chemistry major 
at Carnegie Mellon, where 
she participated in research 
on electronic polymers that 
would lay the foundation of 
her career. She later went on 
to study novel triptycene and 
nanocarbon-based materials 
at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT), where 
she worked towards a Ph.D. in 
organic chemistry in Professor 
Timothy Swager’s laboratory.
After earning her PhD, she 
spent two more years at MIT 
completing her postdoctoral 
fellowship in chemical engi-
neering. Under the supervi-
sion of professor of chemical 
engineering Robert Langer, 
she developed a novel biomi-
metic block copolymer, which 
is a synthetic material that can 
be used for cartilage repair 
through the imitation of bio-
chemical processes.
After spending nearly a de-
cade at MIT, Sydlik was recent-
ly appointed as an assistant 
professor in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Department of Chemistry. Her 
past research prompted her to 
start working in a laboratory 
group that focuses on synthe-
sizing novel polymers and 
materials. During her seminar, 
Sydlik focused on the many 
properties of graphene and 
carbon nanotubules.
Made of carbon, gra-
phene is composed of sheets 
of benzene rings, which are 
molecular structures shaped 
like hexagons. Carbon nanotu-
bules are rolled up, cylindrical 
sheets of graphene. Sydlik had 
an interest in these graphenic 
materials, as they could serve 
as biomaterials with the abil-
ity to repair damaged bone or 
tissue.
“They are conductive. They 
have very high mechanical 
strength,” Sydlik said. “And we 
wanted to tap into that.”
Her research inspiration 
came from her graduate study 
years when she was competing 
as an elite level rower. After 
hurting her shoulder, Sydlik 
was forced to discontinue the 
sport. Taking biomaterials 
classes at the time, Sydlik be-
gan trying to ?gure out ways 
that her shoulder could be re-
paired after realizing that no 
method currently existed that 
could be used to replace her 
injured cartilage.
“I started thinking about 
it, and [I] started to design a 
material that could be used 
for cartilage regeneration,” 
Sydlik said. “And this is what 
I focused my postdoctoral re-
search on.”
Her interests in making a 
material that could mimic the 
mechanical properties of car-
tilage had led her to focus on 
the biocompatibility of gra-
phene oxide, a derivative of 
graphene. Graphene oxide is 
made by mixing graphite, an 
inexpensive aggregate form 
of graphene and the principal 
component of pencil lead, and 
reducing reagents that strip 
away electrons from the graph-
ite molecules. With its vari-
ous functional groups which 
give organic compounds their 
unique chemical behavior, 
graphene oxide would be suit-
able for chemical manipula-
tion, making the compound a 
desirable material for organic 
chemists.
When she started her post-
doctorate research, Sydlik read 
a paper from another research 
university indicating that gra-
phene is auto-degradable, 
MellonHeads hosts lecture on the bene?ts of hackathons 
RYAN BRIGDEN
Junior Staffwriter
Last Tuesday evening, an 
event entitled “Hackathons 
Demysti?ed” was held by Mel-
lonHeads, a recently founded 
group at Carnegie Mellon dedi-
cated to fostering collaborative 
work between individuals of 
various disciplines interested in 
education and technology. The 
event included speakers from 
Carnegie Mellon University and 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
including Po-Shen Loh, an as-
sistant professor of mathemati-
cal sciences at Carnegie Mellon 
University and CEO and Found-
er of the educational technology 
startup Expii. Each of the speak-
ers talked about a different 
aspect of hackathons, and the 
many bene?ts they offer to com-
munities like Carnegie Mellon’s.
The concept behind Mel-
lonHeads was developed at the 
start of the spring 2015 semes-
ter. With help from individu-
als involved in various clubs 
on campus, including ACM@
CMU and ScottyLabs, as well 
as Carnegie Mellon faculty, the 
organization was formally an-
nounced in February of 2015 at 
TartanHacks. 
cAvi Romanoff, a sophomore 
psychology major at Carnegie 
Mellon, was the initial force 
behind the organization. “In 
the beginning, it was just me,” 
Romanoff said. “I planned and 
organized everything, and got 
companies — Google and Face-
book, respectively — to sponsor 
our ?rst two events. Over the 
summer, I created an online 
form for students to apply and 
be considered for joining the 
‘core team,’ a sort of a title-less 
executive team, which has since 
become the organizing force be-
hind MellonHeads.” Since then, 
MellonHeads has grown in size 
and popularity on campus, 
and continues to work towards 
bringing together innovative, 
passionate individuals across 
Carnegie Mellon.
The event last Tuesday em-
bodied this collaborative effort, 
combining talks by students and 
professors of various disciplines. 
Loh began the event by discuss-
ing Expii, a startup that offers 
crowdsourced, interactive math 
and science lessons. According 
to Expii’s website, www.expii.
com, the startup’s mission re-
volves around the belief that 
“high quality educational re-
sources should be available to 
anyone, no matter where they 
are or what they can afford.”
Through talking about Ex-
pii, Loh also commented on the 
growing ability of individuals 
to create social change through 
technology. “The great thing 
that we have today is that if 
you want to go around an en-
tire system which may or may 
not be dif?cult to penetrate 
through the bureaucracy, you 
can, because everyone has [a 
smartphone]. So if you wanted 
to, for example, do something 
to improve education you don’t 
actually need to go sell things 
to schools, you can just build 
something that goes right into 
the hands of everyone,” Loh 
said. “With Expii, that is actually 
what we do.” 
Loh concluded his talk by 
commenting on the potential 
bene?ts hackathons have to of-
fer, noting that his experience 
with Carnegie Mellon students 
in class and at his company has 
revealed a pool of talent and 
an impact-driven culture that 
he believes would thrive and 
bene?t from the hackathon 
experience.
The event continued with a 
talk from Romanoff, who gave 
an overview of hackathons in 
general, in an attempt to debunk 
some misunderstandings of 
what hackathons are and who 
they are for. Hackathons have 
exploded in popularity among 
college students and universities 
over the last several years. These 
caffeine-fueled competitions of-
fer students interested in tech-
nology the opportunity to build 
anything within their means 
and imaginations in under 36 
hours. These technological and 
intellectual showcases are at-
tractive to students for good rea-
son, as in?uential technology 
companies, such as Google and 
Facebook, often sponsor and 
attend hackathons to procure 
future talent. Generally, hack-
athons are perceived as events 
purely for computer program-
mers, yet Romanoff argued for 
a broader understanding of the 
term. “All ages, majors and ex-
perience levels are more than 
welcome,” Romanoff said. In an 
interview with The Tartan after 
the event, Romanoff expanded 
on this idea. “We’re spreading 
the hackathon ethos to as many 
students — and disciplines — 
as possible,” Romanoff said. 
“Why aren’t there hackathons 
for creative writing? Architec-
ture? Improv comedy? Carnegie 
Mellon is home to incredibly di-
verse subjects and students, but 
there’s something that unites us 
through that diversity: our pas-
sion. Hackathons are celebra-
tions of that passion, and we 
intend to spread them to every 
corner of our campus.”
Following Romanoff’s intro-
duction, various members of 
the MellonHeads organization 
gave short presentations about 
the hackathon experience. Pre-
senters included Laura Fulton, 
a sophomore engineering me-
chanics major, Russell Hawkins 
and Rajat Mehndiratta, sopho-
more electrical and computer 
engineering majors, and Tiffany 
Jiang, a sophomore design and 
human-computer interactions 
double major. The presenta-
tions dealt with topics of team 
building and collaborationles-
sons on how to demonstrate 
projects in front of a crowd. 
Additionally, Cyrus Tabrizi, 
Vasu Agrawal, and Edward 
Ahn, sophomore electrical and 
computer engineering and ro-
botics double majors, spoke. 
These three students won this 
year’s PennApps, a hackathon 
hosted by the University of 
Pennsylvania, and spoke about 
building hardware devices as 
an alternative to building soft-
ware. Spencer Baugh, a senior 
computer science major and 
president of the Carnegie Mel-
lon computer club, and Oscar 
Bezi, a junior computer science 
major on the ScottyLabs board, 
also spoke about their respec-
tive organizations.
Looking forward, Mellon-
Heads hopes to continue being 
an active force on campus. They 
are currently working to draft 
a constitution and gain of?cial 
recognition as an organization 
on campus. In the mean time, 
they will continue to host events 
and work toward an inclu-
sive, collaborative hackathon 
experience on campus.

Forest ?res require diverse response
RAGHUNANDAN AVULA
Staffwriter
September 2015 has been 
a month to remember for 
many ?re?ghters in Califor-
nia as they try to subdue the 
three separate forest ?res 
that are raging across the 
state. According to The New 
York Times, almost 8,800 ?re-
?ghters are ?ghting against 
the ?ames that threaten the 
well-being of communities 
and local residents.
Fire?ghting techniques 
have been speci?cally de-
signed to control ?re and pre-
vent damage, and ?re?ghters 
hope they are effective in 
preventing an increase in the 
270,000 already-damaged 
Californian acres.
In general, all ?re suppres-
sion tactics begin with the 
identi?cation and utilization 
of an anchor point, which 
is de?ned by the U.S. Forest 
Service as “an advantageous 
location, usually a barrier 
to ?re spread.” This loca-
tion allows the ?re?ghters 
to “begin building a ?re line 
and reduce the chance of be-
ing ?anked by the ?re.” A ?re 
line is a break in the vegeta-
tion or combustible material 
that is able to stop or slow the 
spread of ?re.
Once the anchor point is 
established, ?re?ghters set 
up a command post and tem-
porary ?re camps that give 
?re crews an opportunity to 
eat, shower, and rest. Here, 
?re?ghters make many de-
cisions about their strategy 
against the ?re, based on the 
observations of ?re chiefs, 
knowledge about the terrain, 
and a variety of quantitative 
measures. These measures 
include the Energy Release 
Component (ERC), which

PUGWASH
ROB MACEDO
Staffwriter
This week at Pug-
wash, the Science, 
Technology, and 
Society club, 
we discussed 
the extent 
to which
Google 
can 
control 
our 
thoughts 
and our 
decisions 
through 
how it 
orders its 
search re-
sults. 
The con-
versation also 
encompassed the 
question of whether 
or not we as Inter-
net users are more 
prone to thought 
control in the digi-
tal media age.
To begin, we 
tried to define how 
exactly Google could 
exert leverage over our 
opinions. We questioned 
whether the ordering of 
search results could sway us 
on certain matters. 
Some members stated 
that while it was possible 
that Google employees could 
order the results in such a 
manner as to encourage the 
company’s beliefs, it was far 
more likely that an algorithm 
could create an “echo cham-
ber” for the users by choos-
ing to display the results that 
most coincided with users’ 
opinions.
 To bolster this point, some 
Pugwash members added 
that the Facebook News Feed 
— a source of news for many 
people — is heavily influ-
enced by the “echo 
chamber” effect. 
Not only do peo-
ple solely witness 
“news” from the 
monologues of 
their friends, 
who they 
most like-
ly share 
beliefs 
with, 
but algo-
rithms 
may be at 
work here 
as well 
to show 
only 
informa-
tion that 
the user 
is biased 
towards. 
Thus, 
our initial 
conclusion 
was that 
these Internet giants could 
influence our thoughts via 
algorithms that provide us 
with the opinions we wish to 
see, perhaps subconsciously.
Next, the discussion 
turned economical and 
philosophical. Why should 
we take offense at these 
websites for presenting a 
biased source of informa-
tion? First, all sources of 
news will be biased in 
some form. Second, 
the free market 
system allows 
these 
companies 
to present 
information 
as they wish. 
It is our jobs 
as individu-
als to choose 
to use other 
digital 
services 
if we are 
unsatis-
fied 
with 
the 
current 
ones. If, in 
fact, Google 
and Facebook do 
offer the superior 
product for information 
distribution, have they not 
earned the ability to have 
some say over what we hear?
These thoughts were 
bolstered by a participant’s 
claim that if Google did be-
come too biased to be useful, 
then internet users would 
refrain from using the ser-
vice. This implied that the 
free market sys-
tem would act 
as a sort of “buf-
fer” for Google’s 
potential biases. 
If the company 
did at-
tempt to over-
reach to the point 
of misinformation, it 
would surely lose a siz-
able percentage of its 
users and be coerced into 
displaying more nonpartisan 
results. 
Nonetheless, this thought 
process was scrutinized by 
another member, who ques-
tioned at what point a prod-
uct would be deemed not 
useful.
It is fully possible, the 
speaker continued, that 
Google could provide one 
with seemingly useful re-
sults, while also subtly bi-
asing the information. The 
original member concluded 
that the ambiguity of the 
term “useful” is the main 
danger in this argument.
Another more philosophi-
cal issue we targeted was the 
connection between power 
and attention.
 In our current world, 
where we place our attention 
determines who and what 
has power over us, one mem-
ber said.
 Thus, in those few min-
utes that we scroll on our 
newsfeed to temporarily 
alleviate our ennui, we do-
nate a piece of our mind to 
Facebook. While this point 
did not elucidate the extent 
to which these companies 
actually intend to affect our 
thoughts, it did accentuate 
how something as seemingly 
benign as our attention is at 
the root of control in the 21st 
century.
In defense of these com-
panies, several members 
noted that echo chambers 
and social influences have 
existed long before the rise of 
the web. For example, think 
of someone remaining only 
in their own social group. 
Is such a situation distin-
guishable from a news feed 
made up of only like-minded 
friends?
 Furthermore, even before 
the foundation of the Inter-
net, forces with ulterior mo-
tives also controlled the me-
dia. If anything, the Internet 
allows one more opportunity 
to explore uncomfortable 
points of views.
Tying these ideas togeth-
er, a couple of members con-
cluded that it was up to us to 
decide how much we let these 
products into our minds. Ac-
tions such as breaking up the 
companies will most likely be 
futile if we do not take the 
time to critically examine our 
sources of information and 
our own points of view.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science, tech-

meaning that after being 
soaked in neutral water for two 
months, it produces harmless 
decomposed organic matter 
called humic acid, which is the 
primary component of dirt. 
This discovery had important 
rami?cations regarding the 
material’s biocompatibility, its 
ability to generate an appro-
priate host response when in-
tegrated into living tissue. “To 
me, there are a lot of questions 
about the biocompatibility of 
nanoparticles, but dirt is really 
not that bad,” said Sydlik.
Graphene oxide had al-
ready been put to use in vari-
ous contexts. Previous studies 
used graphene oxide as a stim-
ulator for normal growth and 
for targeted delivery. Sydlik 
believed that graphene oxide 
had potential for other uses be-
yond the previously completed 
studies. “Despite the volume of 
work, graphene has never been 
tested as an orthopedic mate-
rial,” Sydlik said. “And most 
of the in vivo studies that have 
come out were not extremely 
thorough. They were missing 
pieces.”
After exploring gaps in 
prior research, Sydlik and her 
postdoctoral group found that 
graphene oxide demonstrat-
ed promise as a biomaterial, 
mainly due to its high compat-
ibility in living cells. “[There] 
is this study that kind of sug-
gested that the cells were really 
interacting with the functional 
groups, which would support 
the idea that if you can per-
sonalize graphene oxide, you 
would be able to change the 
behavior of the cells that were 
interacting with the [bio]ma-
terial,” Sydlik said.
Solutions of graphene ox-
ide were also injected under 
the skin of mice to see how the 
graphenic material would fare 
in living organisms. “We were 
actually surprised to ?nd that 
the response we found was 
basically a classic foreign body 
response,” Sydlik said. “[The 
body] seems to be fairly happy 
about having graphene oxide 
implanted.” In addition, the 
rapid in?ltration of graphene 
oxide by the immune cells led 
to fewer cases of chronic in-
?ammation.
After proving that graphene 
oxide was “not so bad” as a bio-
compatible material, Sydlik 
and her laboratory group at 
Carnegie Mellon are trying to 
?nd ways to make the com-
pound more friendly when 
implanted in the body as a ma-
terial for bone regeneration. 
Through passion and creativ-
ity, Sydlik and her colleagues 
hope to make contributions 
to the ?eld of biomaterials 
that will improve many lives 
through the intersection of 
polymer and materials chem-
istry and biomedical engineer-
ing applications.

relates fuel energy potential 
to an area, the Burning In-
dex (BI), which relates ?ame 
length to ?re spread speed and 
temperature, and the Haynes 
Index (HI), which measures 
the stability and humidity of 
a ?re.
Fire?ghters use a combi-
nation of direct and indirect 
attacks within the limits of 
available resources to stop a 
?re, change its direction, or 
slow its spread. A direct attack 
involves applying treatment, 
such as wetting or smothering, 
directly to a ?re. In forest ?res, 
this is achieved through urban 
and wildland ?re engines, ?re 
personnel, and, most notably, 
aircraft that apply water or 
?ame retardants.
The aerial attack is often 
the ?rst response to a forest 
?re, and aerial tankers are an 
integral aspect of ?re?ghting 
tactics. The U.S. Forest Ser-
vice owns and leases more 
than 1000 aircrafts each ?re 
season, which costs the United 
States approximately $250 
million per year. Aerial attacks 
come in various sizes, includ-
ing helicopters ?tted with 
buckets that can be re?lled 
by being dipped in various 
bodies of water. Fixed-wing 
aircraft used for this purpose 
come in all shapes and sizes, 
from small agricultural spray-
ers that can drop 800 gallons, 
to the largest aerial ?ghter, 
a Boeing 747, that is capable 
of dropping 24,000 gallons. 
These carriers can drop either 
water or ?re retardants over a 
large area.
Conversely, the most com-
mon indirect approach is to 
build a ?re line completely sur-
rounding the ?re. This can be 
achieved by digging into the 
ground and creating trenches 
void of vegetation so the ?re 
has nothing left to ignite. This 
strategy utilizes non-combus-
tible material to prevent the 
?re from crossing these lines. 
Sometimes the line contains a 
natural body of water that the 
?re cannot pass.
Another indirect approach 
is to spray or drop ?re retar-
dants ahead of the ?re to de-
crease the ?ammability of the 
land. Modern retardants in-
clude ammonium sulfate and 
ammonium polyphosphate, 
which can subdue the ?re. 
These retardants also act as 
fertilizer to help with the re-
growth of vegetation after a 
?re.
After a ?re is under con-
trol, the threat is far from over. 
While the ?ames may subside, 
the vegetation can continue to 
smolder. This is a slow, low-
temperature, ?ameless form 
of combustion similar to the 
way in which wood remains 
red after a ?re has been put 
out. This type of combustion 
can easily spark another ?re 
if not controlled. During this 
phase, ?re?ghters continue 
cooling the regions of the land 
that are the most prone to 
smoldering.
While many of these for-
est ?res span lowly populated 
areas of land, they can often 
spread into urban communi-
ties and threaten to destroy 
infrastructure. Fires on the 
wildland-urban interface re-
quire unique tactics and coor-
dination between park and lo-
cal community ?re personnel.
The California wild?res 
have destroyed more than 
1,000 buildings and have led 
to over 1,000 people seeking 
sanctuary in large refugee 
camps. Many inhabitants have 
?ed, but thousands of brave 
?re?ghters remain, attempt-
ing to save the lives, commu-
nities, and precious land many 
people and animals call home.

CMU researchers develop The Drinkable Book water ?lters

For many in the United 
States, it is hard to imagine 
the struggles that residents 
of third world countries go 
through. Not only is there a 
lack of ways to ef?ciently ?l-
ter and clean water in these 
countries, but there is often a 
lack of understanding about 
how to be healthy in environ-
ments with unsanitary water 
sources. According to UNICEF, 
over 663 million people are 
still unable to access clean wa-
ter. Additionally, many of these 
individuals do not know basic 
principles of sanitation, which 
can ultimately have devastat-
ing health consequences. 
Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon University, including 
Teri Dankovich, a postdoctoral 
researcher in the civil and envi-
ronmental engineering depart-
ment, are currently working 
toward ?nding a solution for 
these problems through the 
use of an educational book that 
doubles as a water ?lter.
Before coming to Carnegie 
Mellon, Dankovich completed 
her Ph.D. research at McGill 
University, where she dealt 
speci?cally with making an-
timicrobial paper. She found 
that when coated with silver 
nanoparticles, paper acts as 
a ?lter by destroying any bac-
teria that passes through the 
sheet. Since only a negligible 
amount of silver escapes into 
the ?ltered water, this meth-
od of purifying water offers 
major health bene?ts. Unlike 
other solutions that kill bac-
teria, such as chlorine, silver 
nanoparticles are relatively 
harmless since they don’t in-
fect the water supply.
Since then, Dankovich’s 
work with paper ?lters has 
continued to develop. Most 
notably, an advertising agency 
known as DDB New York con-
tacted Dankovich about her 
work and proposed the idea 
of “The Drinkable Book.” This 
concept revolved around pro-
ducing a book made using the 
paper water ?lters, known as 
pAge drinking papers, with 
printed information about 
sanitation and water essen-
tials. Since paper is relatively 
cheap compared to most ?l-
ter devices, this book was 
designed to allow people in 
underdeveloped countries to 
not only access clean water at 
an affordable price, but also 
to educate themselves about 
ways to improve habits of sani-
tary water consumption.
This concept was not, how-
ever, simply theoretical. After 
partnering with the charity 
“Water is Life,” a video about 
The Drinkable Book came out 
in August 2014 and has accu-
mulated more than a million 
views. Since then, there has 
been a great deal of progress 
made towards deploying not 
only the book, but also the wa-
ter ?lters themselves, to actual 
places in need.
Most recently, Dankovich’s 
team of researchers traveled 
to Bangladesh this past sum-
mer to complete ?eld testing of 
pAge. The trip was prompted 
by International Development 
Enterprises (iDE), an organi-
zation that focuses on helping 
those in underdeveloped coun-
tries gain access to necessities 
with little to no change in their 
cultural practices. The team fo-
cused on testing water quality 
from pAge and the reactions 
of Bangladeshis to pAge. Focus 
groups of men and women in 
different areas around Bangla-
desh were asked questions in-
volving the design and the ease 
of use of these paper ?lters.
Angela Ng, a senior civil 
and environmental engineer-
ing and biomedical engineer-
ing double major at Carnegie 
Mellon University, was one of 
the members of Dankovich’s 
team. Ng explained that one 
goal of the trip was to deter-
mine how to implement the 
?lters without altering the cus-
toms of the area.
“The people of Bangladesh 
gather their water in a Kol-
shi,” Ng explained. “But [iDE] 
didn’t want [Bangladeshis] 
to change their current water 
practices to match the cur-
rent design.” Since Kolshis 
are pear-shaped containers, 
the ?at design needed to be 
adapted to better suit the prac-
tices of Bangladeshis. In the 
end, the design that worked 
the best in focus groups was 
a paper ?lter that was shaped 
like a coffee ?lter. This design 
allowed the ?lter to easily ?t 
into the opening of the Kolshi 
so that when Bangladeshis 
scooped up water, any bacteria 
present would be eliminated 
from the water supply.
Despite the success of The 
Drinkable Book, there is still a 
lot of research being done to 
improve the effectiveness of 
pAge ?lters. Although the pa-
per ?lters are said to kill 99.99 
percent of bacteria, there are 
still several concerns that need 
to be resolved. Ng, along with 
Jiajia Lyu, a masters student 
in the civil and environmen-
tal engineering department, 
is working on understanding 
these issues. Current research 
is focused on answering ques-
tions such as how long the ?l-
ters will last, how long the ink 
will last, how parasites and 
waterborne pathogens react 
to silver, and what happens if 
more silver is added to the ?l-
ters. More testing also needs 
to be done in order to meet the 
standards of the World Health 
Organization and the United 
Nations. However, to do this 
research, the dirty water sam-
ples collected in Bangladesh 
need to be recreated, which is 
quite a challenging task. “We 
have to add soil particles, sand 
particles, bacteria, and sea 
salt, monitor the pH, and so 
much more for these speci?c 
standards,” Ng said.
The future of the research 
is still uncertain. “Right now 
we’re discussing whether we 
want to be under full control 
of this, or if we want to form 
partnerships with organiza-
tions that are much bigger than 
us to help move it forward,” 
Dankovich said. Currently, 
The Drinkable Book is still un-
dergoing further research and 
tests. Not only will lab research 
continue, but Dankovich hopes 
to do more ?eld research. She 
plans to conduct a health in-
tervention study by delivering 
the ?lters to communities and 
asking the users about their 
personal experiences with the 
product.
According to Dankovich 
and Ng, production of pAge ?l-
ters in Bangladesh may begin 
sometime in the near future. 
However, there are still many 
complications that need to be 
worked out before anything 
of?cial is decided. Dankov-
ich hopes that in the future, 
pAge and The Drinkable Book 
will become commodity prod-
ucts in places all around the 
world that lack access to clean 
drinking water.

Benger obliterates school rushing record with 303 in loss
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
On Saturday, the Carnegie 
Mellon football team took on 
the Washington and Jefferson 
College Presidents. The Tar-
tans lost by a score of 38–14, 
dropping to 0–2.
The Tartans went three 
and out on their ?rst drive. 
The defense, however, pre-
vented Washington and Jef-
ferson from scoring, stopping 
them on a fourth down. The 
Tartans got the ?rst score: a 
51 yard touchdown run by 
sophomore running back Sam 
Benger. The defense quickly 
recorded a three and out, and 
Benger again broke free for 
a long run. The tide began 
to turn as a pass from senior 
quarterback Andrew Hearon 
was intercepted. 
The Presidents moved for-
ward play by play, earning a 
touchdown and tying up the 
score. On the next drive for 
the Tartans, Hearon missed 
on a pass intended for senior 
wide receiver Graham Shil-
ling that could have been an-
other touchdown. Instead, 
the Tartans had to punt. The 
Presidents then scored a long 
touchdown and took the lead 
before the end of the quarter.
In the second quarter, ju-
nior safety Samer Abdelmoty 
recorded an interception, but 
the Tartans’ offense couldn’t 
capitalize off the turnover. 
The Presidents proceeded to 
score once more, but this time 
the Tartans’ offense respond-
ed with an 85-yard touch-
down run from Benger. The 
Presidents attempted to get 
into the endzone once again 
on a long drive, but were held 
to a ?eld goal. 
The Tartans missed their 
?eld goal attempt on the ensu-
ing drive and went into half-
time down 24-14.
In the third quarter, the 
Presidents defense afforded 
no opportunities for the Tar-
tans, forcing them to punt at 
the end of all their drives. Al-
though the Carnegie Mellon 
defense largely did the same, 
the Presidents scored on a 37 
yard touchdown run, extend-
ing the gap to 31–14. 
The Tartans became more 
aggressive with their plays, 
but could not score in the 
fourth quarter. One more 
touchdown from Washing-
ton and Jefferson sealed the 
game.
The biggest aspect of the 
loss was the passing game — 
or lack thereof. Hearon com-
pleted only 11 of 34 passing 
attempts, and a few key plays 
could have turned the tide for 
the Tartans.
“It was frustrating because 
there were opportunities to tie 
the game and take the lead, 
and we couldn’t capitalize,” 
Benger said after the game. 
“We need to play a complete 
game. We can’t just be good 
on offense or just good on de-
fense or just good on special 
teams. We have to be ?ring on 
all cylinders.”
Benger recorded 303 rush-
ing yards, a new school record 
for rushing yards in a single 
game, 96 more than the previ-
ous record.
The Tartans will seek 
their ?rst win this year at Ge-
neva College this upcoming 
Saturday.

NISHANT RENIWAL
Staffwriter
Anyone who followed the 
English Premier League last 
season knows there was a clear 
winner for the title of the Best 
of the Rest. Southampton FC 
sold half of their starting elev-
en, but quality replacements 
and brilliant management by 
Ronald Koeman meant that 
they ?nished seventh and 
quali?ed for this season’s Eu-
ropa League. However, the 
bigger story toward the end of 
the season was Leicester City’s 
miraculous form to escape rel-
egation. The team was at the 
bottom of the table for what 
seemed like the entire season 
before somehow rattling off 
seven wins in their last nine 
games to ?nish a very credible 
14th at the end of the season.
There were several contrib-
uting factors, such as a stub-
born defense, the upturn in 
form of attackers like Jamie 
Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, and 
some terri?c performances 
from Argentinian legend Es-
teban Cambiasso in mid?eld. 
However, many felt that their 
offseason changes would hurt 
this team. Manager Nigel 
Pearson was ?red; his eccen-
tric behavior was thought to 
be harming the squad. Fur-
ther, there was only one sig-
ni?cant addition to the team 
in striker Shinji Okazaki. The 
“tinkerman” reputation of in-
coming manager Claudio Ra-
nieri didn’t help matters. All 
concerns vanished, though, 
come the opening day of the 
season.
A resounding 4–2 win over 
Sunderland at the King Power 
Stadium was met with admira-
tion by many. The excitement 
didn’t stop at the scoreline and 
the number of goals scored, 
though. The way the team 
played was admirable to say 
the least. Vardy looked just as 
menacing as a top level striker, 
harassing opposition defend-
ers and taking his goal well. 
Okazaki dovetailed very well 
with Vardy in their ?rst game 
together. Winger Marc Al-
brighton returned to the form 
of his early Aston Villa career 
which made him a man to 
watch for every fan in the Pre-
mier League. But none of them 
was the real star of the show.
The man credited with 
Leicester’s unbeaten run 
this season, which currently 
stands at 3 wins and 2 draws, 
is Mahrez. The Algerian in-
ternational has been in noth-
ing short of sensational form; 
most consider him to be the 
player of the season so far. 
While that accolade may have 
something to do with the gen-
erally slow start of several su-
perstars on teams like Chelsea, 
Arsenal, and Manchester Unit-
ed, this takes nothing away 
from Mahrez— the quality of 
his performances genuinely 
merit the player of the year 
talk.
You don’t have to go too 
far to see how good he’s been. 
Just last weekend, Leicester 
was losing 2–0 to Villa un-
til the 70th minute, when 
Mahrez took matters into his 
own hands. A gorgeous cor-
ner was gleefully ?icked on by 
right back Ritchie Da Laet for 
the ?rst goal, before a slalom-
ing run through the Villa de-
fense left several defenders in 
the cold and gave mid?elder 
Danny Drinkwater the chance 
to lay the ball on a plate for 
Vardy to net the equalizer.
The moment of the match, 
however, came for the winner 
when Mahrez picked up the 
ball 10 yards into the opposi-
tion half, before launching 
an aerial through ball/cross 
towards 5’5’’ winger Nathan 
Dyer. The ball landed squarely 
into a (barely) square foot of 
space for Dyer to bravely head 
the ball into the goal. The vi-
sion to pick the pass, out of ab-
solutely nothing, was extraor-
dinary, but the accuracy with 
which the ball was hit was 
certainly world-class. Mahrez 
is a player to watch for the rest 
of the season. Because he’s 
only 24 years old, we could be 
watching him tear up the Pre-
mier League for a while.
Let’s also give credit to Ran-
ieri for the seamless transition 
that he has seen through and 
for what he’s achieved with 
the players at his disposal. He 
retained several key members 
of Pearson’s backroom staff 
to ease the changes he would 
be bringing. Drinkwater and 
Andy King form a mid?eld that 
wouldn’t scare anyone, but the 
partnership of the combative 
Drinkwater and creative King 
has worked very well over the 
last few games. Their form 
has allowed them to also do 
some terri?c business late in 
the transfer window as they 
signed mid?elder Gokhan In-
ler from Napoli. The Swiss in-
ternational was a ?rst choice 
mid?elder for Napoli in the 
Champions League for mul-
tiple seasons and will bring 
veteran leadership, know-
how, and genuine star quality 
in mid?eld. That the Foxes are 
even attracting talent of that 
calibre is a testament to how 
they’ve grown over the last 
few months, while also admit-
tedly emphasizing the spend-
ing power the Premier League 
currently enjoys.
However, it would be churl-
ish of anyone at the club to 
simply ride this wave of form 
and goodwill and hope that 
Leicester will ?nish in the top 
half of the table at least. While 
they are the only other un-
beaten team besides Manches-
ter City this season and cur-
rently sit at a pretty second in 
the table, the Premier League 
can be a cruel beast. Rotation 
of key men will be required, 
although that’s a forte of Ran-
ieri’s and so it should be of lit-
tle worry for Leicester’s fans.
The more pressing con-
cern is their defense. As good 
as their attack looks, their 
defense has been suspect. De-
fenders Robert Huth and Wes 
Morgan are terri?c profession-
als, but are not the calibre of 
players that should be playing 
in central defense for a club 
that has such high ambitions 
and potential. Defender Jef-
frey Schlupp is underrated, 
but they could use a little 
more competition for the full 
back spots as well. Kasper Sch-
meichel may not be as great a 
keeper as his father Peter or 
Leicester City legend Gordon 
Banks, but he does the job, at 
least for now. If City can keep 
the likes of Mahrez and Vardy 
from the clutches of the bigger 
clubs, they may have a solid 
foundation to build a terri?c 
team over the years. Come 
May 2016, we may even call 
them the “Best of the Rest.”
Can Mahrez and Leicester City claim ‘Best of the Rest’?
SPORTS BRIEFS

this Saturday after a road 
win against The College of 
Wooster, the Carnegie Mel-
lon men’s soccer team faced 
off against Bethany College 
as they looked to improve on 
their 4–1 record. The Tartans 
came out with a dominant 
performance, trouncing Beth-
any with an impressive 7–0 
victory.
The game began with an 
aggressive back-and-forth 
between the teams, but the 
Tartans quickly established 
dominance as senior forward 
William Webb opened the 
scoring in the fourth minute, 
picking off a back pass and 
beating the keeper for an im-
pressive unassisted goal. The 
Tartans applied pressure con-
stantly, and were rewarded 
shortly after the ?rst score 
when senior mid?elder Stefan 
Dasbach put a shot into the 
corner off of a pass from ?rst-
year defender Jack McCam-
bridge in the eighth minute.
After giving up two scores 
in the ?rst 10 minutes, Beth-
any began to look frustrated 
with the situation and suf-
fered a number of costly early 
penalties that could have 
been avoided — although 
the Tartans did have their fair 
share of penalties through-
out the game, actually more 
than doubling Bethany’s 
eight penalties. The Tartans 
did not let up, maintaining a 
strong defensive stand and 
possession of the ball for the 
majority of the game, and  
clearly controlling the pace of 
gameplay. Bethany had very 
few shots on goal throughout 
the game, and those shots on 
goal often went wide. The 
Tartans continued to main-
tain control of the game and, 
in the 27th minute, Webb 
scored his second goal of the 
night to put his team up 3–0 
before the ?rst half had end-
ed. The Tartans continued 
to hold Bethany against the 
ropes and, as the ?rst half was 
winding down, Carnegie Mel-
lon put another thorn Betha-
ny’s side as junior mid?elder 
Devin Keane scored in the 
43rd minute for the ?nal goal 
of the half, leaving the score 
4–0 as the teams went into in-
termission.
The second half opened 
in a more controlled fash-
ion than the ?rst as the ?rst 
score of the half came in the 
55th minute and sophomore 
forward Ryan Stinebaugh 
headed a ball into the top 
corner to give the Tartans an 
almost insurmountable 5–0 
lead. There was no sense that 
Carnegie Mellon was going to 
let up their hold on the game, 
and Bethany was simply out-
classed by the Tartans on the 
?eld. The Tartans began to 
run away with the game as 
Bethany grew increasingly 
frustrated with their inability 
to make a play happen. The 
game continued like this for 
the remainder of the second 
half, as Keane scored his sec-
ond goal of the game at the 
end of the 64th minute off of 
a rebound save from ?rst-year 
mid?elder Zack Masciopinto. 
The ?nal nail in the cof?n 
also came from Masciopinto 
who, already being credited 
with two assists earlier in the 
game, made a shot off a re-
bound to put the ?nal score to 
7-0 in favor of the Tartans.
The Tartans will use the 
non-conference games in the 
next few weeks to improve 
their performance without 
the pressure of having the 
results determine the team’s 
ability to compete in play-
offs. While this week’s victory 
against Bethany may have 
been convincing, there is al-
ways room for improvement.
The Tartans will remain 
at home for their match next 
week against the Westminster 
Titans, who, with a respect-
able 4-2-1 record, will look 
to put up a ?ght against the 
no. 17 Tartans. Whether the 
Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer 
team continues to be success-
ful is entirely up to them, but 
for now it looks like they are 
poised for victory throughout 
the regular season. The match 
against Westminster will be 
Monday, Sept. 21, as the Tar-
tans look to dominate once 
again on their home turf.

Mahler snuffs late chance, women’s soccer still unbeaten
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
On Friday night, the Carn-
egie Mellon women’s soccer 
team set out to take on Grove 
City. After a goal shortly be-
fore halftime, Carnegie Mel-
lon was able to hang on and 
pull out the victory. The team 
is still yet to give up a goal and 
remains unbeaten, upping its 
tally to four wins and a tie.
The match started as a 
slow affair. Both teams were 
able to get the ball deep into 
the other side, but there were 
very few chances to score for 
the two squads. That didn’t 
last long, however. Ten min-
utes after the start of the ?rst 
half, Carnegie Mellon was 
able to put together some 
threatening attacks, which 
Grove City simply could not 
match. The Tartans were able 
to collect eight shots on goal 
in the ?rst half. Several shots 
barely stayed within the keep-
er’s clutches, including one by 
?rst-year Kaily Bruch, which 
was just slightly de?ected into 
the crossbar, preventing an 
early goal for the Tartans.
The rest of the ?rst half of 
the game went decidedly the 
Tartans’ way, but they had 
nothing to show for it. Despite 
several very good chances to 
score, they all ended in near 
misses or simply ?zzled out 
before Carnegie Mellon was 
able to capitalize.
Yet, with two minutes re-
maining before halftime, that 
changed. A de?ection after a 
corner kick came to sopho-
more mid?elder Haili Adams, 
who looped a shot around the 
crowd and the goal keeper, 
landing the ball in the net to 
give the Tartans a lead they 
would not relinquish.
The second half brought 
more of the same, as the Tar-
tans spent much of the match 
after the break attacking 
Grove City’s goal. It appeared 
the Tartans had doubled their 
advantage after a shot found 
the back of the net, but it was 
called back for an offside. The 
?ow of play strongly favored 
the Tartans, who had a myri-
ad of chances and corners but 
failed to capitalize on any.
It seemed in the ?nal min-
utes that Grove City might 
have found an equalizer. 
A miscommunication on a 
Grove City goal kick nearly 
caused a breakaway, but a 
quick recovery by the Tar-
tans’ defense forced a shot 
from way out that ended up 
going wide. On another play, 
sophomore goalkeeper Sarah 
Mahler was able to save the 
match by her ?ngertips, de-
?ecting a shot over the net. 
She quickly picked up the 
ensuing corner kick, and 
Grove City never got another 
chance.
The Tartans’ dominance 
was more apparent in the dis-
parity of shots taken than by 
the score. While Grove City 
had some desperate heaves 
towards the net, they were 
only able to tally one shot on 
goal, compared with the Tar-
tans’ 14 shots, nine of which 
were on target. Several corner 
kicks resulted in near misses 
as well. The 14-1 count show-
cases the dominance obscured 
by the 1-0 ?nal. The Tartans 
spent much of the evening in 
front of the Grove City goal, 
while Grove City’s chances 
were few and fortuitous.
The Tartans proceeded to 
beat Frostburg State 3–1 on 
Sunday. Adams added two 
more goals to her tally, bring-
ing her to three for the sea-
son.  Senior mid?elder Carson 
Quiros added another goal, 
her ?rst of the year.
Carnegie Mellon will con-
tinue its schedule on Tues-
day, Sept. 22 as they take on 
Baldwin Wallace.

Make the most of this year’s Technical Opportunities Conference
BRADEN KELNER
Special to the Tartan
University career fairs can 
sometimes seem like mad-
houses, with hundreds of 
employers visiting each day 
and an even greater number 
of students passing through. 
Nevertheless, it’s important 
to remain collected and pro-
fessional when presenting 
yourself to the people who, 
hopefully, will soon be hiring 
you for a full-time position or 
summer internship. Here are 
?ve things you should be sure 
to bring to the Technical Op-
portunities Conference (TOC) 
to make sure you strike the 
perfect ?rst impression.
The right attire
Looking like you know 
what you’re doing is half the 
battle at a career fair. To make 
your attire re?ect the con?-
dence employers want to see 
in candidates, stick to a formal 
dress code. For men, wear a 
business suit with a solid shirt 
or one that has a clean pattern. 
Tuck in your shirt, and wear 
a belt even if you don’t need 
one. Don’t forget a tie and a 
pair of black or brown shoes to 
?nish off your look.
For women, wear a suit or 
a skirt with a suit jacket. Stick 
to neutral colors like black 
or gray, and wear heels to 
complement the out?t. Both 
men and women should take 
the time to iron out wrinkles 
in your pants and shirt and 
to brush off any smudges that 
may be lingering on your jack-
et. As for hygiene, make sure 
your hair is cleaned up — cut 
and combed — and you look 
as if you got more than your 
fair share of sleep the night 
before, even if you haven’t.
Lists of companies to visit
Before attending the fair, 
visit the Career and Profession-
al Development Center’s career 
fair webpages to view the com-
panies coming to campus. Re-
search companies that interest 
you and make a list of the ones 
that seem to be good ?ts.
For the companies you’re 
head over heels for, consider 
spicing up your résumé and 
making unique copies, rather 
than a general résumé, to focus 
on the qualities you know those 
companies are looking for.
Hand your general résumé 
out to the companies you’re 
less interested in, but would 
still be happy to work for. By 
researching companies be-
forehand, you’re sure to make 
a better impression with re-
cruiters. Knowing a company’s 
work and how you can spe-
ci?cally help the company will 
de?nitely make you stand out 
from the rest of the pack.
A portfolio for résumés
Have a handful of résumés, 
but don’t know what to do 
with them? Take a trip to the 
University Bookstore to pick 
up a portfolio. These ?rm fold-
ers for your papers will round 
out your professional look.
Not only do they look sleek, 
but they also ensure that you 
won’t suffer any résumé sna-
fus, like dropping all your pa-
pers or accidentally handing a 
recruiter a unique résumé in-
tended for another company.
These handy folders allow 
you to organize your résumés, 
and a list of references and 
samples of your work if your 
?eld typically requires those 
elements.
Portfolios are easy to tuck 
under your arm and walk 
with, and they also add to your 
air of professionalism while 
giving you something to do 
with your hands.
A water bottle and food
Career fairs can become 
packed and hectic. To give 
yourself some relief in your 
multiple layers of clothing, 
bring a water bottle. Take a 
drink of cool water if you’re 
feeling hot or overwhelmed. 
Staying hydrated will ensure 
that you are focused before 
you visit the companies that 
potentially hold your dream 
jobs.
Before the fair, also make 
sure to eat. Sometimes, you 
may ?nd yourself waiting in 
unexpectedly long lines.Even 
if the fair isn’t crowded, it’s al-
ways better to be over- rather 
than underprepared.
The right attitude
Remember that you’re at 
the career fair to land a job or 
internship. Act that way. Ap-
proach all recruiters as if you 
want nothing more than to 
work for their company. Greet 
them enthusiastically and 
shake their hand ?rmly.
Show them what quali?es 
you for a position at their com-
pany through an already pre-
pared speech, but be sure to 
be ?exible in what you’ve pre-
pared if the recruiter has other 
plans for your conversation. 
Be ready to answer some 
tough questions, and don’t 
break a sweat if you’re not able 
to adequately answer one. An-
swer it to the best of your abil-
ity and get ready for the next 
question.
Ask the recruiter some 
questions yourself to show 
your interest and ensure that 
a position at the business is 
something you truly want to 
pursue. Thank the recruiter at 
the end of your conversation 
and follow up with an email 
afterwards so that they don’t 
forget you.

Metric’s latest measures up
Pagans in Vegas shows a band with a lot on its mind
Last Friday, the Canadian band Metric released 
their sixth album, Pagans in Vegas. This album was 
prefaced by a letter written to the fans with a short 
blurb on what to expect from each song. Before 
listening, I knew this was going to be an album that 
Metric really poured themselves into. It seemed like 
they were very honest with their lyrics and said a 
lot of things that they had been biting their tongues 
about.
The album begins with “Lie Lie Lie,” an alternative 
rock song that has anger dripping out of every word. 
Although I am not entirely clear on the meaning of 
this song, lead singer Emily Haines described it as 
something she wanted to say for a very long time. I 
think it was an interesting choice for the first song 
of the album because it starts off with very whiny 
vocals, and is overall probably my least favorite 
song. This song, in addition to “Too Bad, So Sad,” 
does not fit in with the smooth vibes that the rest 
of the album carries. “Lie Lie Lie” felt like a sharp 
punch that made me brace myself for a hard hitting 
alternative rock album that never came.
A few songs later, in came one of my favorites, 
“The Shade.” The album also includes an acoustic 
version of this song that really highlights Haines’ 
vocals, which sometimes get drowned out by the 
synthesizers. I generally gravitate more towards 
acoustic music, but between the positive lyrics 
and upbeat tempo I can’t help but love the original 
version of this song a little bit more. Some of the 
cheerfulness of the song is kind of lost when it’s 
stripped to its bare bones for the acoustic version. 
Something about the repetition of “I want it all” in 
the chorus keeps this song forever stuck in my head, 
but I don’t even mind it — it’s a testament to the 
song’s catchiness and appealing sound.
Another noteworthy song is “Other Side,” which 
features vocals from band member James Shaw. 
His voice in this song sounds like what sunshine 
after a long winter feels like. It’s light, heavenly, and 
a refreshing break from Haines’ very alternative 
sounding voice. I wish more songs on the album 
featured his voice. One of the best lyrics in the 
whole album is featured in this song when James 
says “And all we want is to feel like all we got/Didn’t 
cost us everything/Even if we never win.” This 
line really shows you how committed they are as a 
band to staying true to their roots and not forgetting 
about the fans that helped to get them to where 
they are.
This album also features two instrumental songs, 
“The Face Part I” and “The Face Part II.” “The Face 
Part I” is a typical, synthesized-instrumental turn. 
Something magical begins to happen at the end 
as classical piano music starts and a phone dial is 
heard followed by a voicemail box. This leads into 
the heart breaking ballad-without-words that is 
“The Face Part II.” These two songs are such polar 
opposites that it’s hard to picture them as two 
halves of a whole. I’m not entirely certain on what 
the meaning is behind the juxtaposition of these 
two songs, but it feels like “The Face Part I” is the 
beginning of a crazy, fun night and “The Face Part 
II” is how you feel at the end of the night after drunk 
dialing your ex and realizing that they’ve moved on.
Overall, I really enjoyed this album. Even if you 
aren’t a fan of new wave indie rock music, it’s 
definitely still worth listening to. I personally was 
not really a fan of this style of music and still found 
this album really enjoyable. It dips into new wave, 
but without being so overly synthesized that you’re 
not even sure if the voices are people or robots. It 
has some very captivating moments as the band 
takes us on a journey from angst to heartbreak to 
happiness and back.

Advice for awkward people
Dearest Josh,
I am a sophomore 
in the BXA program 
for architecture and 
computational biology, 
and I am in dire need 
of some sweet, sweet 
assistance. Last year, I 
was intensely devoted 
to my school work — so 
much so that I neglected 
to make or foster 
friendships, so I find 
myself rather isolated 
this year. I went to the 
Activities Fair this year 
to try and find a niche, 
and I ended up signing 
up for about 25 clubs and 
organizations. I went to 
every single first meeting, 
even going so far as to 
skip some of my classes 
so I could attend these 
events. Long story short, 
I’m now the president 
of three small clubs and 
the secretary of another, 
and I’m not sure what 
to do. I’m meeting so 
many people, doing such 
amazing things, and 
getting so crunk all the 
time. From an objective 
standpoint, it’s becoming 
a problem. What should 
I do to balance my 
growing social life and my 
schoolwork?
Earnestly, 
Balance Is Greatly 
Beyond Everything Reality 
has Taught Her Anytime
Dear BIG BERTHA
Balancing work and play 
is one of the most difficult 
challenges of being a 
responsible adult. Even I, 
in my infinite wisdom, have 
struggled and continue to 
struggle with it. My advice 
for you and anyone else 
who struggles with finding 
balance is to take a step 
back and ask yourself, “do 
these clubs enrich my life, 
or simply drain me?” That’s 
a pretty quick way to find 
out which ones are worth 
your energy and which are 
just taking up time. Also, 
since your majors are so 
intense, you may even have 
to say goodbye or become 
less involved with clubs you 
love. It’s all about you being 
the best you can be. Do 
what you love, and do what 
challenges you — you’ll find 
your niche someday.
Sincerely,
Joshua Brown.

At 8 p.m. sharp this past Tuesday, the darkness of 
Stage AE was split by a battle cry. It was the well-
known shriek of a fan who was simply too excited to 
contain herself. The shriek soon grew into cheers and, 
as the music started, the audience began chanting 
to the lyrics. And all this was just for the opening act. 
Melanie Martinez, the main act of the evening, was still 
an hour away, but the tutu and animal ear clad crowd 
was ready to welcome her.
When I ?rst stepped into the venue, I was disoriented. 
It was too early for Melanie Martinez to be going on 
stage, but the room was buzzing with energy. It turned 
out the enthusiasm was for Handsome Ghost, the 
opener. When they took the stage, they didn’t even 
have to warm up the crowd; people started dancing 
and singing along right away, and it was easy to see 
why. The band may be from Boston, but they have 
an all-American Midwestern charm that fans ?nd 
endearing, and the good looks and excellent vocals of 
the front man seal the deal. Despite the enthusiastic 
reception, the band was down to earth and humble, 
happy to interact with the crowd. The guitarist, a plaid-
shirt-wearing man reminiscent of a lumberjack with 
a raccoon tail tied to his guitar, happily wore a ?ower 
crown that was thrown on stage. Although they relied 
heavily on covers for their set, thus lacking a distinctive 
sound, their opening left no doubt that they are a band 
to watch out for.
After such a strong opening, a question hung in the 
air: could Melanie Martinez live up to that? From the 
moment she stepped on stage, the answer was clear. 
From her baby doll dress and bloomers to her two-toned 
hair, to the violent pastels of her set, Martinez was 
everything the crowd hoped for.
She skipped onto stage dressed as a baby doll and 
launched straight into the title song of her ?rst and 
only album Cry Baby. She bounced around, alternating 
between the grace of a modern dancer and rigid, doll-
like movements that were quite — there’s no other 
word — creepy. Backed up by two men dressed as 
teddy bears in front of giant letter blocks spelling out 
the words “Cry Baby”, she struck the perfect balance 
between childish cutesiness and adult experiences.
This tour, combined with the album itself, gives 
fans their ?rst complete look at her artistic vision. 
Melanie Martinez ?rst came into the public eye when 
she was a contestant on The Voice, doing acoustic 
singer-songwriter style covers of popular songs. The 
Melanie Martinez who took the stage on Tuesday 
night had done a complete overhaul of her musical 
style. Cry Baby is a series of candy-coated pop tracks 
with heaping servings of twisted childhood motifs. 
Songs like “Carousel” and “Tag, You’re It” feature 
lyrics about sexual assault and broken families told 
through common symbols of childhood innocence, 
over increasingly discordant snippets of music box and 
carnival music. The album is an exploration of modern 
coming of age, covering a plethora of issues, from 
beauty standards to mental illness. It is a conceptual 
album, going beyond the music to include an illustrated 
book in the style of children’s storybooks, that Martinez 
produced with a friend and funded herself, as well as 
music videos she conceptualized and directed.
Much like her lyrics, though, her work is not all 
rainbows and sunshine. At times the childish style 
can feel overused, the metaphors stretched. While it 
is important to have artistic vision, which Martinez 
clearly has, diversity keeps things interesting. Her 
inexperience also showed in the set list. All of her 
songs were performed live in the same order as they are 
on the album. The album is tied to a storyline, which 
is detailed in the storybook, so the order is important. 
However, the energy of a concert makes some ?exibility 
necessary. The concert ended up losing some energy 
by the encore.
Still, the power of Martinez’s message and appeal 
should not be overlooked. Cry Baby only came out 
in August, but almost everyone in the crowd knew 
the lyrics to every song. The crowd, dressed in her 
trademark doll-style clothing and singing every word, 
was as much the focus of the concert as the headliner. 
To the backdrop of her bubblegum-bright songs, fans 
vented their own emotions, pressures, and experiences, 
as they screamed out the lyrics. Sure, they might seem 
a little crazy, but in the words of Martinez herself, “all 
the best people are.”

Season premiere of The Mindy Project airs on Hulu
Mindy Kaling’s comedy returns to the screen with a new location and classic content
Last Tuesday saw the return of The Mindy Project not to 
our TVs, but to our computers. The show premiered its 
fourth season on the online streaming service Hulu.
In a perfect world, our favorite TV shows would run 
continuously, forever. We would never have to say 
goodbye to our beloved characters, or be left hanging 
with an unsatisfactory, last minute series wrap-up. 
Unfortunately, this isn’t a perfect world, and sometimes 
bad things happen to good shows.
Just a few years ago, low ratings and a cancellation meant 
the absolute end to a show. In today’s new world full of on-
demand streaming sites, a network cancellation isn’t the 
goodbye it once was.
At FOX, The Mindy Project suffered from low ratings and 
an apparent lack of network support. This funny, offbeat 
show was often overshadowed by more prominent ones, 
leaving it in the dreaded cycle of low ratings, low support, 
and even lower ratings. Finally, after three seasons on the 
air and perpetual bubble status, Mindy was cancelled by 
FOX, and fans were left dejected.
In swoops Hulu with the save! After a few weeks of 
teasing and assurances that all hope was not lost, creator 
and star Mindy Kaling announced a partnership with Hulu 
that would bring the show back for a 26-episode fourth 
season. Episodes are to be released on a weekly basis, 
without the con?icts of sports or other programming that 
throw off schedules on network television.
The other big change is in terms of content. Kaling and 
the show’s team of writers are no longer bound by the 
same rules that of?cially (and unof?cially) govern network 
television. She can be more vulgar, more direct, and more 
controversial and still have those aspects of the writing 
make it to air. But the show won’t go too far off the deep 
end, fellow writer and star Ike Barinholtz told the LA 
Times. “I think if we really changed the show too much 
and made it more risqué and put it more on a tilt of stuff 
you might ?nd on HBO or Showtime, I think we would 
turn off our core viewers.”
This new freedom was apparent in season four’s ?rst 
episode, While I Was Sleeping. The episode makes a more 
direct homage to romantic comedies than usual, mirroring 
such classics as 1998’s Sliding Doors. Picking up after the 
season-ending ?ght with Danny (Chris Messina) about 
marriage, Mindy dreams up an alternate reality where they 
don’t share that titillating kiss on the plane in season two.
Joseph Gordon-Levitt guest stars as her husband in this 
alternate reality, where she discovers that without Danny 
in her life, she’s stuck in an open marriage and managing 
a business venture marketing “slutty girdles for the obese” 
— a far cry from her fertility clinic. Meanwhile, Danny 
has ?own to India to come clean about their situation to 
her parents, where he ends up changing his mind about 
marriage as an institution. It’s a fairly formulaic plot 
line, with the predictable ending that has both of them 
reversing their positions — but winding up engaged 
anyways.
Along the way we get snapshots of what this new venture 
may look like. Characters have the freedom to be a little 
more direct in their crudeness, such as when Morgan 
(Barinholtz) claims he went to Pakistan ?rst in his search 
for Danny, and that the Taliban attempted to recruit him. 
Not really offensive, but not-PC enough to be noticeable.
This week’s episode also went a step further than it 
had in the past about sexuality, making more overt 
references to sexual positions and acts than would 
have been allowed on a network. The question left in 
viewers’ minds is whether this is the new normal or if 
Kaling is just beginning to ?ex her new muscle.
Change is good, and Kaling deserves to have her 
writing and style be supported by her “network,” 
but going too far off the map could alienate viewers. 
For instance, this episode also featured a very heavy 
voiceover by Kaling’s character. At times, this was 
helpful since she didn’t have her normal people to 
bounce her thoughts off of. Here, the viewer replaced 
someone like Morgan or Danny, becoming the sounding 
board for her reactions.
At times though, the voiceover was just annoying and 
felt like a way for Kaling to push the envelope — even 
if she didn’t necessarily have to. At a few points, she 
even did so to the point of alienating her character, 
wondering to herself why Levitt’s character would want 
to “marry [her] fat ass.”
Kaling’s character has consistently toed the line of 
being self-con?dent, but also aware of her body issues. 
Throughout the show’s run, she’s made it clear that 
while she has insecurities about her weight, she also 
?rmly believes that she is smoking hot and any guy 
would be lucky to have her.
So the idea that she would suddenly wonder why an 
attractive, wealthy man would want to be with her, 
simply because she thinks she’s fat, is unsettling to the 
viewer. Maybe, hopefully, this is a byproduct of what’s 
intended to be an internal monologue, which won’t be 
present for the rest of the season.
Change is good, and changing the content of the 
show’s writing could be great. But changing the 
tone and radically changing characters would be a 
disappointment.

From making appearances in late night TV shows to the 
GOP Presidential Debate, this has been a busy week for 
many presidential candidates. The Tonight Show Starring 
Jimmy Fallon had Donald Trump as a guest early in the 
week, who Fallon then vigorously mocked throughout 
the rest of the week. Fallon’s show also brought in Hillary 
Clinton after the GOP Debate and made even more fun of 
Trump. On Late Night with Seth Meyers, we have seen 
Bernie Sanders appear earlier this summer and Martin 
O’Malley this week.
Over on CBS, Bernie Sanders visited the Late Show with 
Stephen Colbert on Friday night, and Jeb Bush visited not 
too long ago as well. And in somewhat unrelated news, 
the Secretary General of the United Nations visited on 
Thursday night. So late night TV got very political this 
week.
It is surprising that Trump even agreed to appear on 
NBC, given its current disdain of Trump’s comments and 
litigious relationship with the candidate. Trump had sued 
NBCUniversal over the Miss Universe pageant because 
Miss Universe will no longer be televised on Univision or 
NBC after Trump’s offensive comments against Mexicans.
Trump continued his busy schedule this week with 
the second Republican candidate debate on Thursday 
where he said a bunch of crazy things no one should 
ever be saying about important topics, such as infant 
immunization schedules should be spaced out over 
a longer period of time with lower dosage shots, 
essentially nullifying the purpose of the immunization 
schedule. Ben Carson, a neuroseurgon, and Rand 
Paul, an ophthalmologist, both said basically the same 
thing, which is a little terrifying and quite interesting, 
considering they are both actual physicians that 
graduated from medical school.
Even though Trump was able to explain some things on 
The Tonight Show and get some laughs, his performance 
was nothing compared to Clinton’s. She handled the 
interviews with aplomb, showing her human side and 
ensuring that people understood that she is not “a robot.” 
The potential Democratic nominee also presented herself 
with her experience, knowledge, and capacity to become 
the next President of the United States. Even though 
general news channels have been portraying her as cold 
and calculating, Clinton has been able to showcase her 
mellow, jovial side and make fun of herself when she 
makes public appearances. For instance, Hillary poked 
fun at her “email scandal” by calling her emails boring 
and mostly procedural stuff. She also participated in a 
sketch that made fun of Trump, wherein ever-comical 
host Jimmy Fallon impersonated the Republican. Of all the 
candidates on late night television this week, Clinton is 
the candidate that I think bene?ted most from talk show 
appearance because she was funny, spoke clearly about 
her ideas, and had the crowd loving what she was saying.
Democratic socialist and Clinton-challenger Bernie 
Sanders had a good time with Colbert on The Late Show 
just shortly after Stephen Colbert began his tenure as 
host. Sanders’ interview was clear and simple, and he 
was able to dispel some of the negativity that surrounds 
the word “socialist.” He made smart comments that the 
crowd enjoyed and was able to showcase himself in a 
program that has a young audience, thus increasing his 
name recognition. Many people have been saying that 
Sanders has a long road ahead to defeat Clinton’s political 
machine, and if he keeps making appearances like these 
and continuing to expand his brand, he might just be able 
to do so.
The rest of the candidates who made appearances on 
talk shows, on the other hand, were not very notable and 
did not do anything strange or unexpected; they were 
bland and vanilla when compared to Trump, Clinton, and 
Sanders. While the presidential election will not be won on 
late night shows, interviews shot on these programs keep 
candidates in the public eye and go a long way toward 
humanizing politicians — individuals who have long time 
have battled the reputation of being lofty, disinterested, 
and overly sobering.

Mary Poppins to be featured in new original 
musical
Director Rob Marshall (Into The Woods, Chicago) has 
been attached by Disney to direct a new, original 
musical featuring the famous magical nanny, Mary 
Poppins. Marshall will work again with his Into The 
Woods producers John DeLuca and Marc Platt to adapt 
the further adventures of P.L. Travers’ beloved character 
for the screen. The new ?lm will feature original songs 
by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (Hairspray, Smash) 
with a screenplay written by Academy Award-nominated 
writer David Magee (Life of Pi).
It will take some time to get used to whoever is cast as 
Mary Poppins. To many, Julie Andrews is Mary Poppins, 
and Mary Poppins is Julie Andrews. The newly attached 
team, however, is creating much excitement for this 
update of an adored, iconic character. Disney seems to be 
lining up the right puzzle pieces for a great new musical.
King Kong makes moves from Universal to Warner 
Bros.
With Kong: Skull Island premiering in March 2017, and 
casting announcements happening all over the place, 
nobody could have anticipated a studio change. What 
does this mean?
First of all, what did Universal get in return? You don’t 
trade your franchise quarterback away and get nothing in 
return. Warner Bros. must have put up some serious talent 
for Universal to consider this move. Total speculation, 
but Universal Studios Hollywood is under construction 
on a “Wizarding World of Harry Potter” section to their 
extravagant theme park. Fantastic Beasts and Where 
To Find Them is set for a trilogy of ?lms with Academy 
Award winners set to star. 
Additionally, Warner Bros. is working with director Gareth 
Edwards and screenwriter Max Borenstein to return for 
the sequel to 2014’s Godzilla, and now with the King of 
the Apes at their disposal...ladies and gentlemen, let’s get 
ready to rumble!
Justin Timberlake set to star in animated 
Dreamworks musical Trolls
There are certain things in this world that simply 
belong together: Spaghetti and meatballs, Peanut butter 
and jelly, Justin Timberlake and an animated musical 
based on those Troll dolls. Pure magic. JT will lend his 
voice to “Branch”, described as a “hilariously hardcore 
survivalist” in this upcoming animated adventure 
?lm. Timberlake joins Anna Kendrick, who will voice 
“Princess Poppy,” and ?lm director, Shrek Forever After 
veteran, Mike Mitchell. 20th Century Fox is developing 
this one, which is set for release in Nov. 2016.
Bryan Singer announces 20,000 Leagues under 
the Sea as next project
Director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men: 
Days of Future Past) took to his Instagram account to 
give us some big news: he just turned 50! Oh, and he’s 
?nished a draft of a script adapting the famous Jules 
Verne tale of Captain Nemo, the Nautilus, and the giant 
squid. Singer is still wrapped up in post-production 
for the next installment of the X-Men series, X-Men: 
Apocalypse, but has 20,000 Leagues under the Sea lined 
up next. X-Men fans need not worry. Singer wrote: “...
Not abandoning the #xmen universe. Very excited about 
#xmenapocalypse and beyond.” The project does not 
have a home yet, but I anticipate a sea-battle between 
studios to grab hold of it.
Transformers writers’ room lays out future plans 
for franchise
The Transformers franchise is one of the sure-?re money 
makers in today’s cinema. Unfortunately, that doesn’t 
say much about the quality of these ?lms. After the 
fourth installment, Age of Extinction, Paramount and 
Hasbro tasked a number of writers with developing 
the future of the franchise. Led by Akiva Goldsman (A 
Beautiful Mind), the writers have emerged with details 
regarding Transformers 5 and beyond. Goldsman is set 
to develop an idea into a script for the ?fth ?lm, starring 
Mark Wahlberg reprising his role as Cade Yeager and 
Michael Bay directing, though Bay is not yet con?rmed. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the ?rst Transformers. It was the 
right blend of action-comedy and sci-? for a summer 
popcorn ?ick (and I will sing the praises of Shia LaBeouf 
until he no longer deserves it). I’ve got to admit, though, 
that I’m off the train. This is like someone calling 
themselves a ?sherman because they caught a trout one 
time. You’ve got to keep catching trout, and Michael 
Bay and Paramount have been reeling in water since 
Revenge of the Fallen. I’ll be keeping my ear to the 
ground for more news about this, and I will hold out 
hope.

There is nothing Pixar loves more than a story about growing up. The animation 
studio takes us on this journey in Inside Out once again, but with an added twist. 
We follow a girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias) through a troubling time in her 
childhood, as she learns how to carefully traverse the ever-changing environment 
of her life. In the ?lm, Riley’s emotions are adorably personi?ed, and each emotion 
lives in her mind’s headquarters and maintains her memories and personality traits. 
Young Riley’s life is narrated by Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler,) when suddenly she’s 
picked up and moved from the Minnesota to San Francisco. The adventure begins 
when Riley is forced to start a new life in this unfamiliar town. We begin to see 
how Riley handles Fear, Anger, Disgust, and, most notably, Sadness (voiced by Bill 
Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Phyllis Smith, respectively) as she slowly starts 
to understand the complexity of her emotions while adapting to new friends, a new 
town, and a new school. Watch the rest of the movie and see how Riley pushes 
forward in an attempt to make new memories and ?nd normalcy in her changing 
life, comforted by the assistance of her many emotions.

Based on the novel written by Jesse Andrews, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl 
takes you on a dramatic roller coaster of emotions with a little comedy along the 
way (but heavy emphasis on the drama). It takes place at a Pittsburgh high school, 
where Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is forced by his parents (Connie Britton and 
Nick Offerman) to befriend Rachel (Olivia Cooke) after she is diagnosed with cancer. 
Greg, Rachel, and Greg’s long-time best friend and parody-?lm-making partner Earl 
(Ronald Cyler II), grow closer as the ?lm progresses. As Rachel’s health declines, 
Greg spends more and more time with her and less and less time focusing on 
school. He and Earl begin working on a movie that Greg intends on dedicating to 
Rachel. As Rachel begins making dif?cult decisions about treatment, and Greg is 
forced to make his own dif?cult decisions about college, the weight of it all causes 
rifts within the friend group. The rest of the movie follows Greg as he struggles to 
remain con?dent in himself and his friendships.

Instead of staying in and watching Netflix on 
Friday night, I decided to venture out to find some 
of Pittsburgh’s culture. I had been invited earlier 
in the week to Trans-Q Live!, “a queer evening of 
performance, dance, poetry, comedy, resplendent 
fantasies, music, and so much more,” and I was not 
disappointed with my experience.
The atmosphere at the Warhol Museum set a 
perfect mood for a night of queer stories. Pop 
art by the openly gay Andy Warhol adorned the 
walls, and house music was playing through the 
lobby. Upon entering the theater, every audience 
member received a gift. Given out by the night’s 
emcee, Joseph Hall, they were 35 mm slides of 
various scenes: landscapes, abstract art, landfills, 
bulldozers, houses, and more. Joseph made everyone 
feel welcome and brought a number of audience 
members up on stage to dance before the scheduled 
programming began.
The transition into the main events happened so 
smoothly that I did not notice it happening. Joseph 
was interacting with the crowd, which filled the 
entire theater and had quite a number of Carnegie 
Mellon students, and led us all in a series of 
affirmations, including “Yaaaaaaaaa -breath- aaas, 
I am everything.” After we were properly affirmed, 
he brought up Kai Hunter to guide us all in singing 
the classic, “This Little Light of Mine.” However, 
we were encouraged to replace Satan in the last 
verse “I won’t let Satan blow it out” with any of 
our oppressors or a generic term that covered all 
oppressors: “I won’t let assholes blow it out.” And 
with that, we were off.
The next act was a performance piece by 
choreographer Jasmine Hearn and filmmaker Alisha 
Wormsley. Against the back wall, a film played with 
various repetitions of the word “black,” as though it 
were on an old television screen. Rickety projector 
noises and mournful music provided sound as the 
image switched on and off. On stage, Jasmine and 
Alisha performed a haunting dance in sheer white 
tops and long black skirts. Their movements were 
spastic and rigid, and their facial expressions gave 
a clear indication of inner pain despite the outward 
appearance of needing to perform well. The final 
moves were in the front of the stage, eyes looking out 
into the audience, as their arms twisted behind and 
they struggled to maintain composure.
As the lights dimmed on Jasmine and Alisha’s 
performance, a new film started up. Entitled “Sloppy 
Kisses,” it contained a cheerful song listing off what 
the singer didn’t like, with each verse culminating 
in “I like your sloppy kisses.” The visuals were a 
combination of the singer dancing in fields while 
wearing a frilly dress, a wig, and makeup, and 
silhouettes of two sloppy kissers, including some 
intense tongue-on-tongue action. Overlaying the 
whole film was a series of brightly colored, glittery 
filters, often looking as though glittery fluids were 
being dripped onto the screen. The transition from 
the previous performance’s seriousness to the light-
hearted cuteness of “Sloppy Kisses” was an abrupt 
but welcoming emotional release.
Following in the same vein as “Sloppy Kisses,” Cindy 
Crotchford was our next delight. She came on stage 
in heels and a rainbow-sequined strapless dress, 
while lip-syncing “Walk Like a Man.” After struggling 
to keep her dress up for a few verses, Cindy 
eventually drew it down and stepped out, revealing 
a beaded bra and panties to the crowd’s delight. As 
“Walk Like a Man” ended and “Trashy” started up, 
Cindy pulled out false breasts from the bra with a 
wink and shrugged it off, as well as tossing off her 
blonde wig to reveal a head of long, black, natural 
hair. By the end of her performance, the underwear 
had gone as well, leaving only a small grey thong 
covering her body.
After Cindy strutted off the stage, another film was 
played. Beginning with a quote about body worship, 
the film was a more serious look at our obsessions 
with the human form. With an aesthetic reminiscent 
of Warhol’s work, “Neo Joe Pop” incorporated a series 
of stills and short clips of one nude male body in a 
variety of poses. In all of them, the model seemed to 
be striving to meet a certain look or expectation, and 
there was always shading or color blocking done over 
the top in a pop art style.
Rounding out the first half was singer and songwriter 
Bell’s Roar from Albany, New York. They performed 
a handful of songs with a guitar and a strong, deep 
voice regarding race, gender, and sexuality. Initially

there were a few hiccups, but once they got into 
a groove, things went smoothly. “I’m still getting 
used to singing and playing at the same time,” they 
explained with a sheepish smile. “I usually just pre-
record the instrumentals.”
Intermission offered a chance to speak with some of 
the performers and discuss the acts with friends, but 
it was almost uncomfortably long. We were excited 
when our emcee stepped back up to the stage.
This time, however, Joseph was not introducing 
anyone. Instead, he read a story about his own 
childhood, focusing on his relationship with his 
parents in particular. One question was a motif: “Do 
you know that moment when you realize your mom 
is not the person you thought she was? Well, maybe 
you don’t.” After describing his childhood through 
various anecdotes, it became clear that Joseph never 
knew his father. He got in touch with his biological 
father just before he died and thought about going 
but wasn’t ready. The story ended with the same 
motif: “Do you know that moment when you realize 
your father is not the person you thought they were? 
Well, maybe you don’t,” making it clear that Joseph’s 
mental image of his father was never shattered by 
reality.
Up next was an act that made “Sloppy Kisses” and 
Cindy Crotchford seem tame. “BLOWJOBgif” was 
a dance performance in front of a film explicitly 
illustrating men engaging in all sorts of sexual acts. 
The single dancer and background music gave 
vivid impressions of the intensity and pleasure in 
the filmed experiences. This was not the first time 
full nudity had been presented in the show, but it 
was the most serious and sexual of all the visual 
depictions.
After the solo performance, a male-female pair took 
the stage. Wearing long headcovers, they began 
dancing in synchronicity before pulling off their veils 
and splitting ways while still performing together 
as a pair. Their intensity was palpable, and their 
shirtless performance gave clear view of the beauty 
of the well-trained human form. Similar to the first 
dance piece, the pair evinced a sense of struggle, 
ending sprawled on the floor while fading out to 
black with the phrase: “Can’t go back.”
Although “BLOWJOBgif” may have been the most 
visually explicit act, visual depictions are not 
the only means of portraying graphic materials.
The penultimate performance was spoken word 
from Bekezela Mguni. Many of Bekezela’s poems 
resonated strongly with black feminist power, but 
the last poem was my favorite, which described 
encounters with her lover. The words spilled from 
Bekezela’s lips in a reflection of the bodily effects 
being described, and the powerful poem had many 
shifting in their seats, whooping and clapping at the 
more arousing portions.
To round out the night was an act that continued on 
the sexual theme but strayed into the humorous side. 
The Bang Gang performed a little skit and song, aptly 
titled “Psychedelic Cowboy Moon Dance.” Nudity, 
pig people, and sexual acts ensued. As another 
theater-goer remarked, it wasn’t particularly artistic, 
but I didn’t mind. The refrain of the song, “Men 
and pigs are often mistaken, but you won’t find me 
fuckin’ bacon,” offered a comedic end to the evening.
Trans-Q Live! billed itself as a night of queer fun, 
and it lived up to its promise. From serious art to 
raunchy comedy, there was a little something for 
everyone’s tastes. The event is a non-regular but 
repeating occurrence, so keep your eyes out for the 
next opportunity to explore performances regarding 
all things queer.

10oakland fest
pillbox 09.21.15
Don’t be shocked if early this Saturday afternoon you’re 
woken out of a hangover by the shaking of your bed. No, 
it’s not the Tyrannosaurus Rex from Jurassic Park or your 
housemate having some midday fun — it’s Oakland’s 
brand-new music festival. Oakland Fest, the area’s ?rst 
EDM event, will invade the Junction Hollow Soccer Field 
in Schenley Park near South Oakland this Saturday, 
?nally bringing some much-needed music festival 
madness to local college students. Music begins at 1 
p.m. with a diverse lineup of D.J.s and live performing 
acts on the bill, including festival trap headliners Red 
Cup Nation from Los Angeles as well as local rapper 
GOAT Entertainment.
The artists billed for Oakland Fest cover a wide array 
of electronic genres, from deep progressive house to 
ratchet festival trap, as well as live hip-hop performers. 
The common thread running through all the acts is high 
energy, so de?nitely be prepared to do some serious 
dancing if you plan to stay for the whole event.
Dominique Monayong Jr., a senior information science 
major at University of Pittsburgh, is the head organizer 
of Oakland Fest. The event is sponsored by Head of the 
Glass as well as A?cionado Group, a local association 
aimed at “breaking barriers between universities 
and promot[ing] social events for college students,” 
according to their website. Monayong started Oakland 
Fest as a way to ?ll a deeply-felt void in the local 
community. “You have Pitt, Duquesne, and CMU all 
within a mile of each other, so you’d think there’d be 
more events where all these students come together and 
have a good time. It’s usually like a ‘Pitt thing,’ such as 
Bigelow Bash, or a ‘CMU thing’ like the Wilkins Block 
Party.” 
“So Oakland Fest is not a Pitt thing or a CMU thing or 
a Duquesne thing, it’s an Oakland thing,” Monayong 
explained.
In addition to bringing local students together, Oakland 
Fest is also geared towards bringing great live electronic 
music right into students’ backyards. A passionate 
lover of concerts, Monayong found that many of his 
best college experiences occurred elsewhere, outside 
of Pittsburgh, instead of at his own university. “I’d go 
to Penn State, West Virginia University, University of 
Maryland for concerts where they’d have people like 
Diplo playing and it made me feel bad a little bit. You 
shouldn’t have to leave your home area to have a good 
time, but it just seemed there was nothing good in 
Pittsburgh.”
Anyone passionate about live music, especially live 
electronic music, is familiar with this heartbreak. While 
many artists do come through, oftentimes it is during 
the middle of the week because this area doesn’t have 
the same kind of market that other college towns do. 
This can be very inconvenient, especially for Carnegie 
Mellon students where typically everyone is under a 
heavy workload. Even though Pittsburgh is a major 
metropolitan area, artists will typically hit here on a 
Tuesday or Wednesday and then play tiny places like 
State College or Morgantown on a Friday or Saturday 
night because of the large state universities in those 
towns.
In terms of the artists performing, Monayong said more 
than “90 percent are local,” with Los Angeles headliners 
Red Cup Nation standing as the only major import. Many 
are frequent local performers, including future house D.J. 
MSSV PR&CE, who is a resident D.J. at Peter’s Pub in 
Oakland. This focus on local talent can do a lot for the 
music community in the area by introducing these up-
and-comers to a larger audience, as well as getting
students engaged with the music community.
Oakland Fest starts on Saturday at 1 p.m., with doors 
opening at noon. The festival is scheduled to end 
around 8 p.m. Tickets are $10, and can be purchased at 
oaklandfest.com.

Horoscopes
aries
march 21–april 19
Being a hyperactive sign, Aries have the most sleeping 
troubles out of all the Zodiac signs. Their dreams are often 
very vivid and intense. Side sleeping is known to improve 
sleep quality.
taurus
april 20–may 20
Sleep can be frustrating for Taurus if they are not 
comfortable. They are sensitive to their environment and 
tend to sleep best with company.
gemini
may 21–june 21
Gemini can survive off of fairly minimal amounts of sleep. 
Their minds are always racing, so sleep never comes easily. 
Many see insomnia as productive “extra” time. 
cancer
june 22–july 22
Because they tend to suffer from nightmares a lot, Cancer 
can have restless sleeping patterns. Drinking a glass of 
warm milk before sleep may calm the nerves.
leo
july 23–aug. 22 
Most Leo are back sleepers who tend to drift off quite 
easily, unless they are stressed. They appreciate bedtime 
and love to sleep among luxurious sheets. 
virgo
aug. 23–sept. 22
Virgo cannot sleep if they are stressed or in an unfamiliar 
environment. Sleep may come easier if they use a white 
noise machine, which helps drown out background noise.
libra
sept. 23–oct. 22
Libra swing between not sleeping a lot and sleeping too 
much. They can spend days in bed and then suddenly 
survive off of minimal amounts of sleep. Balance is key for 
the Libra.
scorpio
oct. 23–nov. 21
Scorpio sleep is directed by their state of moods. An 
excited Scorpio will try to push off sleep as long as 
possible. An unhappy Scorpio will need a lot of sleep to 
become happy again.
sagittarius
nov. 22–dec. 21
Sagittarius is similar to Scorpio in that their amount of 
sleep depends on their mood. They can survive off of 
small amounts of sleep, but usually exhaust themselves 
throughout the day. Excitement and restlessness at night 
usually keeps them awake. 
capricorn
dec. 22–jan. 19
Capricorn appreciate sleep and try to get as much as 
possible. A stressed Capricorn will have trouble sleeping - 
insomnia is a sign of great inner distress for this sign.
aquarius
jan. 20–feb. 18
A mind full of thoughts can keep Aquarius up late at night. 
Winding down and practicing meditation can help soothe 
an Aquarius at difficult times. 
pisces
feb. 19–march 20
Out of all the Zodiac signs, Pisces need the most hours 
of sleep. Their receptive nature means they are drained by 
others, and sleep restores their lost energy.
