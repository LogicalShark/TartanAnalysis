CMU professors and students respond to controversial tweet
LYDIA GREEN
Contributing Editor
Just after winter break, 
several Carnegie Mellon 
students and professors 
engaged in a Twitter dis-
cussion about the best 
practices for teaching 
coding. The thread was 
brought to awareness after 
former adjunct professor 
in the School of Computer 
Science, Robert Seacord, 
tweeted, “As a Carnegie 
Mellon professor, I didn’t 
spend a lot of time cater-
ing to struggling students. 
I think this diverts resourc-
es from those who are 
going to succeed and make 
a difference.”
The tweet has since 
been deleted but not be-
fore students could see and 
interact with it.
Tanvi Bajpai, a junior 
in the School of Computer 
Science and teaching assis-
tant (TA) for 15-151/21-
128, a class teaching the 
mathematical foundations 
for computer science, re-
plied to Seacord’s tweet 
with a thread about the 
importance of helping 
struggling students. 
Another student took 
screenshots of Seacord’s 
tweet as well as Bajpai’s 
replies and posted them to 
the Facebook page “Over-
heard at Carnegie Mellon.” 
This post has received over 
a thousand reactions and 
comments.
Most of the Carnegie 
Mellon students and facul-
ty members who respond-
ed to Seacord’s tweet, both 
online and offline, strong-
ly disagreed with the opin-
ion presented in the tweet 
and felt that it was not rep-
resentative of the school 
overall. 
In an interview with 
The Tartan, Carnegie Mel-
lon School of Computer 
Science Professor David 
Kosbie said in response 
to the tweet, “No matter 
what one person may say, 
if they hold an opinion that 
[Carnegie Mellon] profes-
sors are [not devoted] to 
their students, they hold a 
wrong opinion. Not just a 
minority opinion: a wrong 
opinion. In my experience, 
[Carnegie Mellon] profes-
sors are truly devoted to 
their students. They may 
express this in many dif-
ferent ways, but that truth 
lies at the core.”
Kosbie, who has many 
times taught the popular 
introductory computer sci-
ence course 15-112, has 
ample experience handling 
coding beginners and 
struggling students. Kos-
bie stresses that figuring 
out how best to help strug-
gling students can be com-
plicated, as introductory 
coding students can be 
quite a diverse bunch in 
terms of their experience 
and what they need to 
learn best.
“There are many ways to 
help struggling students,” 
Kosbie says. “Office hours, 
tutoring, advising, being 
sure they are aware of and 
using their resources well, 
perhaps helping them seek 
counseling, helping them 
live healthily and keep a 
balanced perspective. The 
list goes on and on. And 
none of these is a panacea. 
No one approach will work 
all the time. So faculty 
need to be creative as well 
as observant, to reflect on 
a student’s very individu-
al situation, and find the 
best approach for that one 
struggling student.”
With some struggling 
students, it can be un-
clear what a professor 
should do. Kosbie raises 
the example of a student 
who is not putting in 
enough effort for what-
ever reason, be it a lack 
of belief in their ability, a 
lack of sleep, or a lack of 
motivation. “Sometimes, 
heroic intervention can 
help such a student pass a 
course. Sometimes not. In 
the latter case, however, 
maybe in some cases fail-
ing the course can be the 
best learning outcome for 
them — if they self-reflect, 
consider why they failed, 
and consequently modify 
their behaviors to be more 
successful thereafter. Isn’t 
that then a success? What 
should the professor do in 
such a case? I am not say-
ing they should simply let 
the student fail, but nei-
ther am I saying that that 
is obviously uncaring or 
inappropriate.”
As for Seacord’s tweet, 
Kosbie believes that a pro-
fessor cannot determine 
which students will end 
up succeeding a making 
a difference on the basis 
of one homework assign-
ment or one course at one 
time. He says, “I defy a 
faculty member to deter-
mine with any confidence 
all their students who will 
be the most successful over 
time. I have seen students 
struggle, and struggle, and 
struggle, and struggle. And 
finally, finally, get it, and 
then shine brightly! And I 
have hired such students 
to TA. And I have seen 
them go on to brilliant 
careers. In fact, in many, 
though certainly not all, 
such cases, their struggles 
were somehow essential 
for their future successes.”
Iliano Cervesato is an-
other School of Computer 
Science professor who of-
ten teaches the introduc-
tory course, 15-122. 
Cervesato agrees with 
Kosbie that the needs of 
students in such courses 
are widely varied. “15-122 
introduces computer sci-
ence to a large swath of 
the student population 
on campus — 800-900 
altogether in the current 
academic year, a number 
equal to about half this 
year’s freshmen class. With 
size comes diversity: some 
students have years of 
programming experience, 
while others have had ex-
posure to no more than the 
basics; some are commit-
ted to pursuing computer 
science as a career, others 
don’t know much about it 
and just want to check it 
out,” Cervasato said in an 
interview with The Tartan.
Regardless, he believes 
that it is a Carnegie Mellon 
professor’s job to help 
all struggling students: 
“Struggling students are 
students who need a lot 
of help, and I think we do 
a good job making oppor-
tunities to seek help avail-
able to them. In fact, I see 
this as an obligation on our 
part, within the bounds of 
the resources available to 
us.” 
One such bound is the 
time availability of TAs. 
Cervesato explains, “We 
are blessed in that the 
university provides us 
with lots of resources in 
the form of a large num-
ber of wonderful, knowl-
edgeable, caring and truly 
dedicated TAs... Now, we 
need to remember that 
TAs are students too, with 
their own coursework, 
deadlines and other obli-
gations. Because of this, 
I encourage my TAs to set 
boundaries.”
Although many 
Carnegie Mellon computer 
science professors intend 
Pittsburgh Promise scholarship impacts future CMU students
ZACH GOLDSTEIN
Staffwriter
The Pittsburgh Promise 
scholarship announced 
on Jan. 29 its intention to 
implement significant re-
forms beginning with the 
current class of seniors in 
Pittsburgh’s public high 
schools. The changes in-
volve lowering the maxi-
mum scholarship amount 
from $7,500 to $5,000 per 
year, while broadening full 
eligibility status to a larger 
population of students.
Previously, the schol-
arship amount was de-
termined using a “sliding 
scale” which gave more 
money to students who had 
been attending Pittsburgh 
Public Schools for a longer 
time. A student who has 
been in the school district 
since kindergarten used to 
be eligible for more than 
someone who transferred 
to the district in middle 
school, for example. But 
starting with the high 
school class of 2018, stu-
dents who meet certain 
criteria (namely a 2.5+ 
GPA, attendance record 
of 90+ percent, and ac-
ceptance into a college in 
Pennsylvania,) can receive 
up to the full scholarship 
amount so long as they 
have been attending a 
traditional public or pub-
lic charter high school in 
Pittsburgh since the ninth 
grade.
Two other efforts 
to widen the group of 
scholarship recipients will 
soon take effect as well. 
The first is the establish-
ment of a $1,000 minimum 
scholarship to students 
who receive a full ride to 
college via another schol-
arship program. The sec-
ond change is the ability to 
spend scholarship money 
on room, board, and text-
books in addition to tu-
ition.
These reforms are 
especially important to 
students whose tuition are 
covered by other scholar-
ship programs but none-
theless struggle to afford 
other college expenses. 
While critics argue that 
this money could be bet-
ter spent helping students 
whose tuition is not fully 
covered, The Pittsburgh 
Promise explained in a 
press release that these 
efforts are in response to 
a University of Pittsburgh 
study, which stressed the 
importance of room and 
board support for low-in-
come college students.
While the current cohort 
of Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity students who receive 
the scholarship will be un-
affected by the changes, 
the news has major impli-
cations for future classes of 
Carnegie Mellon students 
from Pittsburgh. This is es-
pecially the case because 
the number of Pittsburgh 
Promise Scholars at 
Carnegie Mellon has been 
on the rise for the past 
several years. Brian Hill, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Director 
of Student Financial Servic-
es, wrote in an email to The 
Tartan that the Pittsburgh 
Promise “greatly reduces 
the self-help (loans and 
work) resources that 
Pittsburgh Promise recipi-
ents would otherwise need 
to cover their educational 
expenses.”
On top of being one of 
the many eligible colleges 
for the Pittsburgh Prom-
ise, since Sep. 2017, 
Carnegie Mellon has 
been a “Preferred College 
Partner,” one of 19 
Pennsylvania colleges and 
universities that provide ad-
ditional support to ensure 
the success of Pittsburgh 
Promise Scholars. Accord-
ing to Hill, the financial 
aid office hopes that this 
effort will do something to 
make up for the decreased 
maximum scholarship 
resulting from the recent 
program reforms.
By choosing to be a 
Preferred College Partner, 
Carnegie Mellon is al-
locating some of its lim-
ited financial aid funds 
specifically for Pitts-
burgh Promise Scholars 
in order to improve the 
University’s relationship 
with its surrounding com-
munity. When asked in an 
interview why such an ap-
proach was chosen over 
allocating the money to 
the general financial aid 
pool, Hill defended the 
decision. “It’s part of be-
ing a Pittsburgh citizen,” 
he said. “The program 
has been great to our stu-
dents who have come here 
through the Promise, and 
we want to make sure that 
it continues.”

The Undergraduate 
Student Senate’s Campus 
Life committee recently 
launched a new campus 
outreach initiative in the 
form of the Humans of CMU 
Facebook page. Originally 
based on Brandon Stanton’s 
viral Humans of New York 
Instagram account, Hu-
mans of CMU aims to show-
case many of the unique 
and compelling stories that 
walk on our campus every 
day. The goal is to display 
the diversity of perspectives 
that our community has to 
offer, by pro?ling different 
organizations, individuals, 
and events on our cam-
pus. Humans of CMU will 
provide a central spotlight 
on the diversity, commu-
nity, and unity that exists 
at the heart of the Carnegie 
Mellon community.
Initially, Humans of 
CMU wants to publish a 
series of interviews with 
in?uential student leaders 
on campus, aiming to show 
the variety of backgrounds 
that Carnegie Mellon 
University hosts. Student 
leaders are unique and of-
ten have compelling stories 
about their paths thus far 
that aren’t always visible 
from the outside. Humans 
of CMU aims to delve deep-
er into those moments and 
leverage the uniquely po-
tent portrait-interview for-
mat to begin to tell those 
stories in a way that we can 
all relate.
Campus Life committee 
recognizes the ability of 
a variety of different ?g-
ures to provide impactful 
insights that shape the ex-
perience of everyone on 
campus. In light of that, 
Humans of CMU will be 
reaching out to faculty and 
campus leaders as well as 
students, aiming to include 
their perspective and foster 
a culture of understanding 
where students and faculty 
can bond over shared cul-
tural experiences and the 
joy of life’s most meaning-
ful moments.
Moving forward with 
the project, the Campus 
Life committee aims to keep 
a consistent engagement 
with different aspects of 
our campus by creating spe-
cial themed weeks that cre-
ate a more focused view the 
various activities that shape 
the lives of all our students 
— for example, Humans 
of CMU will host “Athlet-
ics Week” and “Technology 
Week,” allowing the stu-
dents and community mem-
bers who are immensely 
dedicated to those activities 
to share their passion and 
illustrate the diversity that 
permeates our campus just 
below the surface.
Interviews are currently 
being conducted on 
campus, both through 
existing student leader-
ship channels and through 
the classic, serendipitous 
approach utilized by the 
original Humans of New 
York. For those who have a 
story to share, please reach 
out to us too! Stay tuned 
on Senate’s Facebook page 
at www.facebook.com/
cmusenate. Interested stu-
dents will be contacted by 
Ryan Dumas to further the 
interview process.
Finally, Humans of CMU 
is just getting off the ground 
— check out the current 
Facebook post, and be sure 
to share the link with other 
members of our campus to 
spread awareness and dis-
cussion of the diversity, in-
clusion, and unity that our 
campus is capable of.
Please direct any inqui-
ries, comments, or sugges-
tions about this initiative to

Marx@200 kicks off this semester with panel discussion
ADAM TUNNARD
Junior Staffwriter
There are few figures in history that 
evoke as much admiration, disdain, 
and often heated debate as Karl Marx. 
In celebration of his influential and 
controversial life and work, attendees 
of the Marx@200 events organized 
by The Humanities Center will gather 
to discuss his writings and the vari-
ous ways they have been applied since 
their inception. Whether you’re a dyed-
in-the-wool libertarian or hammer and 
sickle-sporting communist, Marx@200 
events offer a nuanced take on Marxist 
thought in the modern day.
If Karl Marx were alive today, it 
would be his 200th birthday. 2018 also 
marks the the 170th birthday of Marx’s 
most-referenced work, The Communist 
Manifesto, and 2017 marked the 150th 
birthday of another famed piece of his, 
Capital: Critique of Political Economy. 
Scholars of Marx across the world have 
used these birthdays as a special oppor-
tunity to discuss his influential writing.
At Carnegie Mellon University, 
Marx@200 will join in this worldwide 
examination of Marx’s work with a 
series of lectures, performances, and 
even art installations. The Humanities 
Center at Carnegie Mellon, which em-
phasizes the importance of research 
and interdisciplinary studies and 
seeks to create a larger role for the 
study of humanities, is behind this 
commemoration, hoping that it will, 
according to their website, “explore 
Marx’s critique of inequality and capi-
talism as well as his influence on politi-
cal movements and political regimes, 
including totalitarianism.” This past 
Tuesday, they hosted the first event of 
the semester.
The lecture and panel discussion was 
called “Marx and the Global South,” 
and featured four distinguished pro-
fessors and their opinions on how 
Marxism has been applied to the global 
south, including their critiques of it. 
Though there were seemingly obvious 
examples panelists could have drawn 
on, from Ché Guevara’s revolution to 
communism in Southeast Asia, the lec-
turers tackled obscure and fascinating 
subjects untouched by even the most 
well-read Marxists.
Marian Aguiar, Associate Professor 
in the Department of English at 
Carnegie Mellon University, started the 
discussion with an acknowledgment of 
Marx’s ungainly westernized perspec-
tive related to India, but resolved to say 
that “the global working class should 
have various contextual changes” and 
could benefit from Marxist ideals. The 
next speaker, University of Pittsburgh 
Associate Professor in the Depart-
ment of English, Susan Andrade, 
riffed on material from her cultural 
studies course, “Uneven Development 
and Cultural Production,” which fo-
cuses on the idea that “Marx teaches 
that economic relations are uneven 
between different classes of people, 
that unevenness is the condition of 
capitalism,” according to her website.
The next speaker was Paul Eiss, a 
Carnegie Mellon History Professor, 
who spoke about how the “geograph-
ic struggle, rent-seeking behavior, 
and price increases” in Latin America 
make the region conducive to Marxist 
theory, and also spoke about how a 
Marxist community in Mexico known 
as Cherán has thrived and became a 
“poster child of movements.” He was 
followed by Shalini Puri, Associate Pro-
fessor in the Department of English at 
the University of Pittsburgh, who gave 
a riveting explanation of her Marxist 
beliefs and how they have influenced 
her studies in the Caribbean.
As these descriptions may suggest, 
the short lectures were dense, by de-
sign, in order to foster a thoughtful 
discussion. Most of the professors 
were seemingly sympathetic toward 
Marxist ideology, but I suspect much 
of the Baker Hall room was diverse 
in thought, judging by the quality of 
discussion. Anyone interested in Karl 
Marx, whether he represents ideologi-
cal perfection or the bane of political 
theory, could have enjoyed the educa-
tional event this past Tuesday.
As previously mentioned, this was 
only the first event of the semester. 
The next is a lecture by Jessie Ramey 
of Chatham University, on “Gender and 
Inequality in the Age of Neoliberalism.” 
Throughout the rest of the semester, 
more lectures, discussions, art installa-
tions, and a reception will be held. For 
a full schedule, visit https://www.cmu.
edu/dietrich/humanities-center/center-
events/marx-200-events.html.
Karl Marx, whether one is 
sympathetic to his message or not, is 
someone worth studying further and 
his 200th birthday gives perfect reason 
to coalesce around a complex and con-
troversial subject such as Marxism. 
At Carnegie Mellon, The Humanities 
Center has provided an accessible 
means of celebrating the figure by 
organizing Marx@200.
Reaction to professor’s tweet showcases learning at CMU 
to provide the resources 
for success for all students 
regardless of struggle, 
many of the comments on 
the Facebook post were 
from people saying they 
had experienced the brunt 
of Seacord’s philosophy, 
that they needed to be 
“weeded out” of a Science, 
Technology, Engineering 
and Mathematics (STEM) 
field in order to make 
room for brighter students. 
For some, this mental-
ity started in the very first 
week of college: “When I 
was an incoming [Com-
puter Science] freshman, 
our advisor told us that 
our first two years will be 
like a ‘boot camp,’ and I re-
member how freaked out I 
was about that, initially,” 
Bajpai told The Tartan.“We 
know that we’re supposed 
to work hard, and so we 
turn that into a competi-
tion: who stayed up the 
latest? Who got the least 
amount of sleep? Who has 
gone the longest without a 
shower?”
What Bajpai is describ-
ing is a stress culture, a sys-
tem in which it is expected, 
required, and normalized 
that people be stressed out 
to the detriment of their 
happiness, relationships, 
and well-being. 
It has long been docu-
mented that Carnegie Mel-
lon has a stress culture, 
and it is especially preva-
lent in the STEM majors.
According to Bajpai, 
stress culture is enabled 
by the idea that constant 
competition in STEM is 
beneficial to those fields. 
“What I’ve noticed about 
this whole ‘weeding out 
kids in STEM’ mentality 
is that most people that 
think like this believe 
that that’s why classes in 
STEM are hard, like, we 
make STEM hard because 
we only want the best of 
the best doing it,” Bajpai 
explained. “That’s just ab-
surd. Classes in STEM are 
hard because the subject is 
difficult.”
Bajpai believes that in 
order to combat the stress 
culture at Carnegie Mel-
lon, the focus should be 
shifted from grades and 
assignments to learning. 
“Taking the time to learn 
the material is more im-
portant then spending 
all the time in the 
world to desper-
ately try to finish 
one assignment 
in a class. I think 
professors here 
already try to 
encourage that 
kind of mental-
ity,” she con-
tends. “But most 
students have associated 
some kind of glory with 
staying up super late or 
not eating or showering... 
I think we need to not 
perpetuate and advertise 
that ‘glory’ to incoming 
classes.” Bajpai explains 
that this is why she wrote 
in her tweets about being 
lucky to have people stay 
up late with her and make 
sure she understood a sub-
ject rather than finished 
an assignment.
For anyone looking to 
teach, Professor Kosbie 
advises to “not judge 
the struggling stu-
dent. Help them as 
best you can, and 
shower them with 
love and support. 
And if 
they 
fail, as     some surely shall, 
still be there for them to 
help turn that into the best 
failure possible for them, 
that they may grow and be 
stronger for it.”
Seacord refused to com-
ment when The Tartan 
reached out in order to 
get his response to the 
reaction to his tweets 
by the Carnegie Mellon 
University community.

Annual Grammy Awards fails in representation
Each year, the Grammys spark 
heated debate. In recent years 
much of the discussion has been 
centered around diversity and 
for good reason. Only a hand-
ful of black artists have won the 
three most prestigious awards 
— Album of the Year, Song of 
the Year, and Record of the 
Year — while many have been 
pigeonholed into categories like 
hip-hop, R&B, and “urban con-
temporary.” In fact, only one hip-
hop artist has ever been awarded 
one of the three major awards: 
Outkast for Speakerboxxx/The 
Love Below in 2004. Clearly, the 
representation of minorities is 
an issue that needs to be better 
addressed and solved.
However, another constant 
source of drama has been that 
the awards often end up being 
a popularity contest. Over the 
past few years, the main three 
awards have typically been given 
to the most popular artist of the 
year, as opposed to the artist 
who created the most artistically 
impressive or meaningful piece 
of work. For example, this year, 
Bruno Mars, who has produced 
some of the best pop songs since 
2010, swept the board with sin-
gles “That’s What I Like” and 
“24K Magic” off his album 24K 
Magic.
However, his catchy party 
track and love song from 2017 
managed to beat out all of the 
nominations from what has been 
nearly unanimously deemed the 
best album of the year by crit-
ics: Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN. 
DAMN was Lamar’s third power-
ful masterpiece in a row, featur-
ing hard-hitting beats and angry 
but agile rapping, Lamar’s signa-
ture intricate storytelling style, 
and intense lyrics that delve into 
politics, fame, and faith. While 
Lamar handily won every rap 
category, he was unable to break 
through in any of the three main-
stream divisions. In fact, despite 
already being considered among 
the greatest rappers of all time, 
Lamar has never triumphed in a 
major category, even having had 
all three of his studio albums 
nominated for Album of the Year.
One of the main reasons why 
artists like Lamar 
get snubbed is 
because their 
music isn’t considered “safe” 
enough. The Grammys would 
rather dish out the awards to 
party tracks like Mars’ “Uptown 
Funk” or mushy love songs like 
Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out 
Loud” than an angry hip-hop 
track that deals with touchy is-
sues like institutional racism and 
police brutality. This is not to say 
that Mars and Sheeran aren’t ex-
tremely talented pop musicians 
— they certainly know how to 
write an addicting melody and 
lyrics that easily get stuck in 
your head—but their art isn’t 
nearly as impactful or complex 
as Lamar’s.
Such snubs can even happen 
within the genre-specific 
categories, with one of the most 
glaring examples being 2014’s 
award for Best Rap Album, 
where Macklemore and Ryan 
Lewis’ The Heist managed to beat 
out Kendrick Lamar’s good kid, 
m.A.A.d. city. The former album 
was incredibly popular that year, 
especially among non-hip-hop 
listeners and was best known 
for the pop anthem “Can’t Hold 
Us” and the silly “Thrift Shop.” 
good kid, m.A.A.d. city, on the 
other hand, was a gritty, plot-
driven account of the dangers 
of growing up in Compton, 
California, the city where Lamar 
is from, and was deemed an 
instant rap classic. Here also, the 
Grammys chose to reward the 
safer, more mainstream artist.
While the way the Grammys 
hands out their awards is disap-
pointing, it should not come as a 
surprise. They have consistently 
gotten it wrong for the past sev-
eral years. Therefore, it might 
instead be helpful to investigate 
the causes and what they mean 
for the Grammys’ status as an 
awards show.
We have to remember that 
the Grammys are essen-
tially a once-a-year 
television show. 
They, like any 
show, are try-
ing to cater 
to an audi-
ence and 
convince 
as many 
people to 
tune in 
as they 
can, and 
the audi-
ence that 
will get 
them the highest ratings is main-
stream America. This explains 
why The Recording Academy 
tends to reward the most popu-
lar songs; the more people know 
the winning songs, the more 
they will enjoy watching and the 
more they will want to watch 
again the following year.
Another part of attracting 
larger television audiences, es-
pecially as television ratings rap-
idly drop as more people switch 
to streaming, is to transition the 
awards show into more and more 
of a spectacle. This is just what 
the Grammys has done. Less of 
the actual handing out of the 
awards is being televised, with 
the only major categories and 
a few specific genre categories 
making the cut. Instead, much 
of the Grammys’ airtime is filled 
with radical performances and 
speeches from hosts and win-
ners. This year, stand-out mo-
ments included Kesha’s moving 
response to sexual harassment 
with her song “Praying” and 
Camila Cabello’s support of the 
“Dreamers” protected by De-
ferred Action for Childhood Ar-
rivals (DACA), an Obama-era 
immigration policy that was re-
scinded by President Trump, in a 
poignant speech.
This results in many viewers 
simply watching for the perfor-
mances and speeches, rather 
than being invested in the actual 
results. Additionally, many peo-
ple are more interested in the 
glamor of the “Red Carpet” than 
the awards themselves, looking 
to see what extravagant dresses 
and otherworldly makeup their 
favorite celebrities don for the 
event. Even if their favorite artist 
does not win, people are enter-
tained by the increasingly theat-
ric performances and the allure 
of the “Red Carpet”.
Essentially, the Grammys 
are shifting away from 
being an awards 
show and instead 
becoming a sort 
of year-in-re-
view concert. 
Yes, they still 
do give out 
awards, but 
they tend 
to highlight 
the most 
popular 
music each 
year rather 
than the most 
critically ac-
claimed, and 
fewer of these 
decisions are 
shown on tele-
vision each 
year. Instead, the 
Grammys have be-
come a celebration 
of excess: a compe-
tition for who can 
wear the wildest 
dress, who can have 
the most elabo-
rate, mind-blowing 
performance, and 
who can make the 
boldest statement 
in their speech. It’s 
time to stop expect-
ing the Grammys 
to be an accurate 
measure of the most 
artistic music of the 
year and instead just 
sit back and enjoy 
the show.Anna Boyle/Art Editor

A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled by JOE FAKE
CASSIE SCANLON
You might have seen the 
headlines. Harvard University 
banned single-gender organi-
zations in May 2016, but they 
are now being enforced for the 
?rst time. Those who decide on 
single-gender organizations are 
barred from holding leadership 
positions, including athletic team 
captains. This ban came after 
Harvard’s poor policies regard-
ing sexual assault came to light. 
But Harvard’s banning of single-
gender organizations takes away 
powerful female-only spaces, 
leading to the #HearHerHarvard 
movement, which is one I proudly 
support.
The #HearHerHarvard focus-
es on the positives many women 
have found in sororities across the 
country. Even at Carnegie Mel-
lon, I’ve seen students who are 
not a part of Greek Life question 
its importance. But here, just as 
in Harvard, Greek Life can serve 
as an important part of someone’s 
undergraduate experience. Greek 
Life is not for everyone, but it has 
given valuable skills and experi-
ence I simply would not be able to 
?nd elsewhere.
While Carnegie Mellon cur-
rently has more ?rst-year females 
enrolled than ?rst-year males, 
Carnegie Mellon was a tradition-
ally male school, and females in 
STEM still have to combat stereo-
types daily. Being in a sorority, 
I’ve seen ?rsthand the common-
place discrimination, especially 
of women of color, within STEM 
?elds. Without the space afforded 
to me by Greek Life, I’m not sure I 
would have been as aware of the 
workplace discrimination these 
women face.
But Greek Life has also provid-
ed sorority women the opportuni-
ties to help break the glass ceiling. 
Last semester, the Panhellenic 
Council provided a session with 
Professor Linda Babcock, who 
taught us how to negotiate for bet-
ter salaries to help lower the wage 
gap. I would not have learned 
this information if it were not for 
Greek life.
Greek Life has also provided 
a space to talk about 
sexual assault, which 
is, unfortunately a 
glaring issue at Carn-
egie Mellon — while 
the fraternities’ role in 
sexual assault is often 
brought up, I’m not 
going to comment 
on this at this time; 
it’s far too compli-
cated of an issue 
to try and discuss 
in this article. My 
sorority has also pro-
vided a space for women 
to talk about these is-
sues. It’s not just recom-
mending resources; I’ve 
had plenty of conversa-
tions in the living room 
of my sorority house 
on not only how we can 
better support survivors 
but also how we think 
we can terminate rape 
culture here at Carnegie 
Mellon. If it wasn’t for 
Greek Life affording me 
this female-only space, 
I probably wouldn’t be 
having these conversa-
tions, nor would I have 
realized how widespread 
an issue sexual assault is 
here at Carnegie Mellon.
My sorority has also 
given me the basic ideals we were 
founded on: sisterhood and ser-
vice. Last year, the Greek Commu-
nity gave back to Camp Kesem and 
raised over $100,000. Through 
the philanthropy I’ve been able 
to participate in thanks to my so-
rority, I’ve realized my passion 
for service. Its also 
given me sisters 
who have 
been there to be my shoulder to 
cry on and celebrate my greatest 
moments so far as an undergradu-
ate.
But, I will also agree that 
Greek Life can make improve-
ments. We could do a better job 
with diversity and 
intersectionality, and this is a con-
cern we are trying to address as 
a community. When Greek Life is 
done well, it can have tremendous 
bene?ts for not only its members 
but also its community. Greek 
Life at all schools is not perfect, 
but I have seen Greek Life here 
bene?t its members in ways that 
are indescribable. I never once 
felt unwelcomed (or hazed, for 
that matter), and my sorority 
has allowed me to grow as 
a student, leader, and per-
son, giving me a space to 
talk about women’s 
issues. When they 
say “it’s not four 
years, it’s for life,” 
they’re not kid-
ding; I will for-
ever carry the les-
sons I have learned 
and am continuing to 
learn as a member 
of the Greek Com-
munity for the rest 
of my life.

State of the Union: President Trump knows how to read
Greek Life provides college women strong communities
Anna Boyle/Art Editor
TREVOR LAZAR
Junior Staffwriter
Make no mistake: Donald 
Trump is still Donald Trump. The 
State of the Union address was 
one many expected to mark a con-
tinued pattern of deranged ram-
blings in public appearances, yet 
what we saw was very different. 
Namely, Trump stuck to the tele-
prompter. The speech shared little 
rhetorically with Trump’s usual 
Twitter outbursts and hyperbolic 
attacks. It was undoubtedly writ-
ten by his team of advisors, some 
of whom are competent enough 
to construct coherent English 
sentences unlike the President. 
Trump’s signature off-script quips 
of “terrible” and “carnage” were 
nowhere to be found.
And yet, the terrible policies 
behind his typical insultingly 
simplistic language remained. He 
spoke of the need for a southern 
border wall and reinforced his ap-
parent unwillingness to negotiate 
on immigration, despite empty 
calls for bipartisanship that he 
has in days since thrown to the 
wayside. Noticeably absent were 
calls for the border wall to be paid 
for by Mexico. While nothing has 
changed on Mexico’s position on 
the matter — they have repeat-
edly, remarked that they will 
never pay for such a preposterous 
wall — Trump’s personal position 
remains unchanged. In opportu-
nities where Trump gets to speak 
freely, he still insists Mexico will 
pay. This notion is just as absurd 
now as it was when he ?rst intro-
duced the idea years ago and so 
too is Trump himself.
So, Trump’s tendency to 
completely fabricate statis-
tics that aid his position 
continued. Has unemploy-
ment been go-
ing down? Yes. 
Is it the lowest 
it has been since 
the market crash 
of 2008? Also 
yes. But, just as 
Republicans at-
tempted to shift 
the blame for the 
2008 ?nancial 
crisis from Bush 
to Obama, they 
also now seek to 
take credit for 
Obama’s eco-
nomic successes. 
Trump claimed 
that “since the 
election, we 
have created 
2.4 million new 
jobs.” According to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, that number 
is actually 1.8 million. Moreover, 
that is the slowest rate of jobs 
growth since 2010. So no, the im-
pact of their controversial tax cut 
bill has not been instant and it is 
certainly not responsible for the 
continued improvement of the 
economy.
Perhaps the most egregious 
example of Trump’s statistical 
cherry-picking comes in the form 
of African American employment. 
During the campaign, Trump 
falsely claimed that 58 percent 
of young African Americans were 
unemployed. In truth, the num-
ber was actually 19 percent as 
reported by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. Now, Trump not only 
accepts these statistics but claims 
that he is responsible for the 
change. The overall rate 
of African American 
unemployment was 
7.7 percent when 
Trump entered 
the of?ce and 
has only since 
fallen 0.9 per-
cent. This sug-
gests not that 
Trump has had 
a positive im-
pact on the rate 
of African Ameri-
can employment, 
but rather that rate 
has so far been unaffected 
by his policies. 
Given Sec-
retary of 
Education Betsy Devos’ well-doc-
umented attempts to undermine 
the public school system under 
Trump’s appointment, it would 
not be surprising to see the rate of 
African American unemployment 
soon start to increase.
During the 2016 election, the 
stock market was a giant bubble 
waiting to burst according to 
Trump. Now, he boasts about the 
soaring market and how substan-
tive an impact his policies have 
had on it. (I know what you’re 
thinking: what policies?) He 
claims the majority of tax cut ben-
e?ts will go to the middle class 
when in truth they will dispro-
portionately aid families earning 
more than $200,000 per year. As 
usual, Trump’s truth is a lie.
So what should we take away 
from the State of the Union? Ex-
actly what we should have taken 
away the moment Trump an-
nounced his candidacy: facts have 
no place in Trump’s world. What 
I believe to be more important is 
the impact he has had in his ?rst 
year in the Republican party. The 
GOP has been perpetuating half-
truths and falsehoods regularly 
for decades now. They were and 
are often called out for it by the 
news media and the public. The 
difference is that now they feel 
invincible. Trump has shown that one can invent an entirely 
?ctional reality to operate in and 
still be successful politically. Per-
haps it is his celebrity status that 
gives him that power. It most cer-
tainly has to do with the color of 
his skin and his gender. But, 
it is important to remember that 
the Republican party also has the 
power to do the right thing.
The only Republicans calling 
Trump out are not running for 
reelection. While the under-
standing persists that standing 
against Trump as an elected or 
running Republican is electorally 
irresponsible, so too should the 
“decency” that representatives, 
like Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ), 
love to preach. Republicans like 
Flake have nothing to lose. But, 
the United States has everything 
to lose. If the Republican party 
steers deeper and deeper into 
being a legislative vehicle for 
Trump, they jeopardize the fed-
eralist system established under 
the Constitution and the objective 
reality that we live in. If facts can 
be debated and if Senators can be 
unilaterally swung to serve the 
ludicrous wishes of the President, 
then we risk the 
democratic republic 
under which we all 
live.

Missouri’s Senate candidate sparks outrage across nation
MADELINE KIM
On Dec. 12, 2017, the nation 
nervously waited for Alabama 
to choose between Republican 
Roy Moore, an alleged predator, 
or Democrat Doug Jones, a 
consistent advocate for civil 
rights throughout his career. 
However, 2017 did not see the last 
of suspenseful Senate elections 
between conventional candidates 
and strikingly unquali?ed 
candidates. On Nov. 6, Missouri 
must elect someone to represent 
its state in the House.
Here is where Republican 
candidate Courtland Sykes comes 
in the scene.
Sykes identi?es himself as 
the “America First candidate” 
and has consistently shown 
support for President Donald 
Trump’s campaign promises and 
policies. “If you like President 
Trump, then you and I see eye-
to-eye,” he proudly stated in his 
campaign video. Ultimately, he 
has a mission to “ful?ll Trump’s 
‘America First’ agenda,” which he 
believes is being “sabotag[ed]” by 
“globalists and Big Government.”
His stance on immigration 
is just as ?rm as Trump’s. 
“Immigration is out of control,” 
he says as a video of a riot plays 
in the background. Generalizing 
all immigration as being a 
detriment to American society 
is both misleading and factually 
incorrect. At ?rst glance, 
immigrants may be interpreted as 
an economic burden to a nation. 
However, the Wharton School of 
the University of Pennsylvania 
has shown empirical evidence 
which demonstrates the positive 
economic impact immigrants have 
left in this nation. Welcoming 
immigrants has provided more 
opportunities for non-immigrants, 
and immigrants generally 
pay more in taxes than they 
consume in government services. 
Immigrants are responsible for 
a “disproportionately high share 
of patent ?lings, science and 
technology graduates, and senior 
positions at top venture capital-
funded ?rms.” The Apple device 
that you are probably reading this 
article with would not exist had 
it not been for a refugee’s son. 
The contributions are 
endless. However, 
even without 
the overwhelming support that 
data can provide, isn’t life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness 
reason enough for us to welcome 
Americans? Not according to 
Sykes’ or Trump’s de?nition of 
“Make America Great Again.”
He demands the swamp in 
Washington be drained. In his 
video, he de?nes this by having 
“no more RINOs [or Republican 
In Name Only],” ?ashing a 
video of Speaker of the 
House Paul Ryan 
(R-WI), and “no 
more liberals,” 
showing an emotional 
Rep. Rosa DeLauro 
(D-CT). He heavily 
advocates for a 
uniform conservative 
government that will 
not “stand in Trump’s 
way.” What Sykes, like 
many hyper-partisans, 
conveniently forgets 
is that the U.S. is a 
democratic republic, 
meaning there is not, 
nor should have, just 
one party ruling in 
Washington. We need 
representatives in the 
Senate who speak 
for the millions of 
Americans, not just 
the select portion 
who happen to have 
one speci?c political 
view. That is not to 
say that Democrats 
and Republicans have 
all lived together 
in harmony, but 
such blatant demonizing of the 
opposing party is a phenomenon 
that has not been seen to this 
extent.
Sykes’ criticism does not 
end with his political life. He 
additionally drew sharp criticism 
for his equivocal answer to 
the question: “Do you support 
women’s rights?” What should 
warrant a simple “yes” or “no” 
ended up being a ?ve-paragraph 
essay in an interview and later 
posted on Facebook where he 
criticized gender equality. “I 
support women’s rights, but 
not the kind that has oppressed 
natural womanhood for ?ve 
long decades,” he states. He 
expects to “come home to a 
home cooked dinner at six every 
night” and for his daughters to 
adopt a similar lifestyle to the 
one he and his ?ancé have set 
up. Of course, there is nothing 
inherently wrong with traditional 
gender roles if that is what the 
couple desires. However, Sykes 
fails to differentiate personal 
beliefs and ethics. What he and 
his ?ancé decide to do is up to 
them, but what other individuals 
and families do across America 
is not. Instead of encouraging all 
Americans regardless of sex to 
pursue the “American Dream,” his 
paradigm discouraged just about 
half the U.S. population from 
pursuing their respective dreams.
Although the Senate 
candidates who have sparked 
controversy have generally been 
Republican, it is important to 
note that the GOP is not the only 
party that is susceptible to having 
candidates who are morally-
questionable; the Democratic 
Party has beyond its fair share 
of dirt that must be exposed. 
The problem of creating a larger 
political division runs far deeper 
than differences or con?icts 
between parties. It greatly lies 
in the divisive mentality that 
any political party can internally 
generate.

2018 Winter Olympics puts South Korea in uncertainty

JUHYUNG PARK
 
With the opening ceremony of 
the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics 
fast approaching on Feb. 9, South 
Korean society has mobilized 
at an effort to successfully host 
50,000 participants and staff 
from 95 countries at the winter 
Olympic and Paralympic Games. 
From the continuous hard work 
of the 129-member organizing 
committee to the thousands of 
volunteers who have dedicated 
countless hours to the training 
and preparation of the event to the 
ordinary citizen eager to welcome 
an international crowd to their 
home country, the past year for 
Koreans has been one of a common 
mission and purpose.
The observed general unity, 
however, is an oversimpli?cation 
of the social sentiments revolving 
around the Olympic games. Since 
2011 when PyeongChang was 
selected as the host city, there has 
been much debate surrounding 
the broader goal of hosting such 
an event. Government of?cials 
have argued since its inception 
that the Olympics would promote 
peace in the region, creating 
opportunities for the two Koreas 
to hold talks and to display to the 
international community that the 
peninsula is one of peace and not 
one of con?ict. Such a discussion 
about the role of the Olympics in 
relationship with the two nations 
has revealed a creeping divide 
within Korean society about 
relations with the North.
This growing divide among 
Koreans has much to do with 
an increased presence of a 
conservative political faction, led 
by the Liberty Korea Party, and a 
generational gap that has become 
increasingly out of touch with 
much of Korean contemporary 
history — a story of divided 
families, a divided economy, and 
most signi?cantly, a divided nation 
that has worked arduously to 
position itself in the 21st century 
and has struggled greatly to seek 
a unique South Korean national 
identity.
Such an increased internal 
divide has not been well-
documented in Western media, 
yet the evidence of its existence 
can be most patently seen in South 
Korea’s response to Kim Jong Un’s 
Address.
“North Korea’s participation in 
the Winter Games will be a good 
opportunity to show unity of the 
people and we wish the Games will 
be a success,” said Kim in his New 
Year’s Speech. “Of?cials from the 
two Koreas may urgently meet to 
discuss the possibility.”
While for many this was a 
message of hope — a historic 
stepping stone for reuni?cation 
of the two Koreas — others saw 
this as an act of deception, driven 
by ulterior motives and a desire 
to take the spotlight away from 
South Korea. The Moon 
administration’s seemingly 
all-embracing cooperation 
with the North — the 
hosting of reuni?cation 
talks, the welcoming of 
North Korean athletes, 
performers, and of?cials, 
and an agreement to ?eld 
a joint women’s ice hockey 
team, to name a few — 
has been met with both 
support and criticism.
“Maintaining peace 
between the North and 
South is the most urgent 
issue,” said Park Cheol-
hyun, in an interview 
with Channel News Asia, 
who came to cheer on the 
debut of the joint women’s 
ice hockey team with his 
family last Sunday. “It’s 
important to achieve that 
through the Olympics and 
I think the uni?ed team is 
very meaningful.”
Meanwhile, on Jan. 
22, groups of protesters 
gathered at Seoul’s central train 
station protesting the decisions 
made by the administration with 
banners reading, “We’re opposed 
to Kim Jong Un’s Pyongyang 
Olympics!” The backlash has been 
accompanied by a seven percent 
drop in President Moon’s approval 
ratings.
While I empathize more with 
the optimists, believing that the 
Olympics could indeed spark a 
period of increased collaboration 
with the North, I do have my 
hints of doubt about the motives 
of the Kim regime. Many experts 
have offered a wide array of 
explanations on Kim’s sudden 
change in tone, such as attacking 
South Korea’s relations with the 
U.S., presenting the North as being 
cooperative at an attempt to relieve 
U.N. sanctions, or buying time to 
produce more nuclear weapons in 
midst of a crippling North Korean 
economy.
However, though I do not 
associate myself with the social 
conservatives in the South, I 
comprehend the complaints and 
criticisms of many of the Moon 
administration’s agreements with 
the North. It seems to me that, 
after decades of a tumultuous and 
emotionally-draining history of 
the South, there now exists a more 
evident and unique South Korean 
identity. It is an identity fueled by 
a story of perseverance in light 
of con?ict and division, military 
coups and dictators, and extreme 
economic hardship. In this context, 
some of the administration’s 
decisions — which have been 
made in the name of furthering 
efforts at reuni?cation — may 
seem to have gone too far in 
disregarding this new national 
identity: for instance, the ?ying 
of a ?ag of the Korean peninsula 
instead of a South Korean 
?ag or the ?elding of 
a joint women’s ice 
hockey team instead of a full South 
Korean roster.
The administration, therefore, 
must be well-aware of this 
precarious situation. Indeed, 
the support for reuni?cation still 
remains strong among South 
Koreans, and Moon still reigns a 
solid 66 percent approval rating. 
However, a moderate approach is 
necessary in these heated times, 
and the more apparent South must 
be respected and recognized.
As for the average South 
Korean, like me, who does not 
really know how to feel about 
these changes, we will cheer on 
both the North and the South 
Korean representatives in all their 
sports endeavors at the upcoming 
PyeongChang winter Olympic 
games.

When scientists apply 
for research funding and 
reviewers evaluate applica-
tions with a focus on the ap-
plicant’s CVs, male scientists 
are more likely than female 
scientists to receive funding. 
When reviewers focus on 
the proposed research, the 
bias vanishes.
These were the ?ndings 
of a recent study of 24,000 
grant applications to the Ca-
nadian Institutes of Health 
Research (CIHR), a federal 
funding agency similar to 
the U.S. National Institute 
of Health. In 2014, CIHR re-
placed its traditional grant 
application system with a 
more modern one, consisting 
of two complementary grant 
application programs. In 
one program, grant applica-
tions are evaluated 
mostly based on the 
proposed research 
the grant would 
support. 
In the other, 
grant applica-
tions are evalu-
ated primarily 
based on the ap-
plicant — their 
previous re-
search and their 
career.
 A team 
led by health-
informatics 
researcher Holly 
Witteman exam-
ined years’ worth of 
grant applications and their 
outcomes, comparing the 
two grant programs. 
They found that in the 
applicant-focused program, 
not the proposed research, 
male applicants were four 
percent more 
likely than female 
applicants to be accepted. 
Witteman says ,“That is a 
signi?cant difference,”, 
especially considering 
the overall application 
acceptance rate was about 
15 percent. 
This gender bias was not 
present in the 
grant program 
that focused on 
the proposed 
research itself. 
This study’s 
results are less 
ambiguous than 
other studies on 
gender bias in 
grant proposal 
applications. 
Previous studies have 
often been without success   
because they typically did 
not take into account the 
research ?elds of applicants 
(and the gender ratios in 
those ?elds), the nature 
of the grant program, and 
what factors the reviewers 
were actually assessing. 
Witteman says her team 
was able to draw “more ro-
bust conclusions” because of 
the unique dual structure of 
CIHR’s grant program and 
because they statistically ac-
counted for the factors that 
many other studies have not. 
The study’s ?ndings are 
hopeful because it shows 
that sometimes it only takes 
a simple change to reduce 
bias: in this case, asking 
application reviewers to 
focus on the science of the 
proposal rather than the 
scientist.

Focusing on science reduces bias in research funding
Researchers create hologram-like 3D suspended images

The scene in Star Wars: 
Episode IV — A New Hope, 
when through the bluish 
light of R2-D2’s suspended 
3D image, Princess Leia 
famously says, “Help me, 
Obi Wan Kenobi. You’re my 
only hope,” captures, argu-
ably one of the most iconic 
moments from the Star 
Wars universe. 
With its graceful 
desperation, an under-
current of hope and the 
impending possibility of 
adventure, the scene, in 
some ways, sets the mood 
of the movie. It inspires us 
to seek out those moments 
of adventure in our own 
lives, and the best part is 
that we might be able to 
do that with 3D images like 
the one in the scene.
Researchers at Brigham 
Young University in Provo, 
Utah, have managed to 
create such an image about 
the size of a postage stamp, 
according to Science. 
At the moment, the re-
searchers’ technology uses 
a single particle to draw 
these images, which means 
that it can only draw very 
small pictures, though they 
are high-resolution pic-
tures. 
Daniel Smalley, an elec-
trical engineer who worked 
on the research says that to 
make the images bigger, 
they would have to re?ne 
their prototype and create 
a system to manipulate 100 
to 1000 particles at once.
Previously, we have 
used holograms — 2D im-
age surfaces — and certain 
illusions to render 3D ob-
jects in a 2D space. How-
ever, the images created 
by them have to be viewed 
from a certain angle to be 
seen fully. In addition to 
But, the new 3D images 
actually occupy 3D space 
and can be viewed unob-
structed, and perfectly 
from all angles. It could 
be thought of as a hyper-
realistic 3D sculpture made 
of light.
According to Science 
magazine, this free 
space volumetric display 
works by ?rst “trapping” 
a cellulose particle in a 
photophoretic “trap” — 
small particles trapped by 
an intense beam of light. 
The trap is essentially 
a suspension of some gas 
or liquid that has been ex-
posed to a beam of laser. 
The laser then guides 
the particle around at a 
very high speed while red, 
green, or blue lights illu-
minate it. Thi high speed 
image makes the tracks of 
light appear as a single im-
age to the observer’s eye.
This particle then becomes 
a single pixel, as it scatters 
the illuminating light. 
Thus, similar to the ef-
fect of waving a sparkler 
around, guiding the parti-
cle in a loop to scatter light 
in the same ways over and 
over again, blurs the pixels 
together to create an image 
made out of light. 
The group’s research 
was published in Nature 
this past January.
HOW THINGS WORK
RFID: a reliable solution to many widespread problems
EMMA FLICKINGER
Assistant SciTech Editor
What does your debit card have in 
common with a smartphone, a library 
book, and an outdoor cat? All of these 
things are commonly equipped with a 
technology called Radio Frequency Iden-
ti?cation, better known as RFID.
RFID is a short-range technology that 
uses radio waves to track and identify spe-
cially tagged items. Because RFID tags are 
usually small, light, and ?at, they can be 
attached to almost anything. According to 
Wikipedia, each tag has a microchip that 
contains digitally stored data, as well as 
an antenna that can send or receive radio 
signals.
According to howstuffworks.com, to 
read the data on an RFID tag, you need an 
RFID reader. The reader sends out elec-
tromagnetic energy in the form of radio 
waves, which are received by the tag’s an-
tenna. The tag responds with its own ra-
dio signal, which contains the data stored 
on its microchip. The reader can then pick 
up and interpret (“read”) the data.
What kind of data do you store on an 
RFID tag? Some tags, like the anti-shop-
lifting tags you can ?nd in any retail store, 
are manufactured with their data built in 
and permanently ?xed, often a unique se-
rial number that can be used to identify 
an item. On other tags, the stored data 
is something that needs to be custom-
ized, changed, and updated — like the 
RFID-enabled computer chip in some pub-
lic transit passes, which keeps track of your 
balance, deducting the cost of a fare each 
time you use the card.
Most commonly, because RFID tags are 
mass-produced and cheap, the stored data 
is incredibly simple. “Electronic article sur-
veillance tags, which are still used in pack-
aging today, have a 1-bit tag. The bit is 
either on or off.

The Children’s School at 
Carnegie Mellon University 
— one of the most sought 
after children’s schools for 
children three to six years 
of age in Pittsburgh — is 
celebrating its 50th anni-
versary this year. In 1971, 
it was placed under the 
Department of Psychology 
in the Dietrich College of 
Humanities and Social Sci-
ences. 
The school was founded 
in 1968 by Ann Baldwin 
Taylor — a developmental 
psychologist and educator, 
with a grant from the Esso 
Foundation and support 
from psychology professor 
John Sandberg. 
Dr. Baldwin served as 
director of the school for 
25 years after which Dr. 
Sharon Carver, who also 
teaches at Carnegie Mel-
lon, led the school and 
is serving her 25th year 
as the school’s director. 
Dr. Carver completed her 
Bachelor’s and Ph.D. from 
Carnegie Mellon.
Dr. Baldwin founded the 
school based on the vision 
of John Dewey — philoso-
pher, psychologist and ed-
ucational reformer — who 
believed in progressive 
education, such as learning 
by doing, and argued that 
learning is a social process 
which makes the school a 
social institution through 
which social reform can 
and should take place. The 
school designs its own cur-
riculum and comprises of 
96 students who are both 
racially and economically 
diverse, with only 15 per-
cent from Carnegie Mellon-
af?liated households and 
one-third of the students 
on partial or full scholar-
ship. At the moment the 
school has 17 educators 
and three substitutes. In 
a Carnegie Mellon press 
release, Dr. Carver says, 
“the needs of the children 
have not changed all that 
much over the years, but 
each year the 
Children’s School makes a 
greater impact on [Carn-
egie Mellon] and the 
broader community of ear-
ly childhood development, 
research, and education.” 
The laboratory school 
provides a space for over 
200 undergraduate stu-
dents enrolled in child 
development courses and 
research to better under-
stand children’s language, 
concepts, mathematical 
and scienti?c thinking, and 
other cognitive founda-
tions for learning.
The school provides 
its students with 
a construc-
tive learning 
environment and in return, 
the students participate in 
research conducted at the 
school. While enrolling, 
parents have to consent to 
the research studies which 
are only conducted if ap-
proved by Dr. Carver and 
the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB).
One of the projects that 
the school has is Message 
from Me, which is an age 
appropriate adaptation of 
technology that allows the 
children to record the ac-
tivities of their day using ki-
osks and send 
them to 
their 
parents’ mobile phones or 
emails. According to the 
Message from Me website, 
this project is based on the 
principle that, while these 
children — aged three to 
?ve — are developing rap-
idly and in many ways, 
they are unable to tell their 
parents what they “did at 
school” due to limited abili-
ties in remembering and 
explaining. 
This would not only fos-
ter better communication 
skills among the children 
but also “enhance parent-
child conversations in 
ways that 
impact the child’s feeling of 
individuality, self-con?dence 
and well-being.”
Another example of the 
research at the school is that 
of Dr. Anna Fisher — an As-
sociate Professor in Carn-
egie Mellon’s Psychology 
Department who is currently 
working on “Classroom En-
vironment, Allocation of 
Attention, and Learning 
Outcomes in K–4 Students.” 
The research aims to study 
the effects of visual media 
on children’s ability to get 
distracted in a classroom 
setting.

RFID tags could potentially eliminate checkout lines
 from RFID, A7 
If someone pays for the 
item, the bit is turned off, 
and a person can leave 
the store,” explains Mark 
Roberti of RFID Journal. 
“But if the person doesn’t 
pay and tries to walk out 
of the store, readers at the 
door detect the tag and 
sound an alarm.”
There are two main 
types of RFID tags: active 
tags power their own sig-
nals with an internal bat-
tery, while passive tags 
must “harvest” energy 
from the reader’s signal to 
send a reply.
 According to RFID 
manufacturer AB&R, the 
way the tags interact with 
the reader determines 
the kind of RFID system: 
Active Reader Active Tag 
(ARAT), Active Reader 
Passive Tag (ARPT), and 
Passive Reader Active Tag 
(PRAT). In both ARAT 
and ARPT systems, the 
tag is activated by the 
reader’s signal. Most RFID 
systems in our everyday 
lives belong to this cat-
egory. In PRAT systems, 
the reader simply acts as 
a receiver for signals from 
the active tags; these sys-
tems are used to keep tabs 
on an inventory of large, 
valuable items that can 
move around, like a herd 
of cows.
According to the 
Smithsonian Museum 
of Natural History, RFID 
was originally a military 
invention, designed to 
supplement radar. Radar 
was an essential tool dur-
ing World War II, but on a 
radar screen you couldn’t 
tell if the planes you saw 
were your ?ghters, or the 
enemy’s. To ?x that prob-
lem, the British designed 
a technology they called 
“Identify Friend or Foe,” 
or IFF: the ?rst RFID sys-
tem. IFF, installed in ?ght-
er planes, sent out radio 
waves to other aircrafts. 
If the other planes were 
friendly, their own IFF de-
vices would respond with 
a radio signal marking 
them as allies.
After RFID technology 
was ?rst declassi?ed and 
made available for civil-
ian use in the early 1970s, 
it was mainly used for 
keeping track of herded 
cattle. HowStuffWorks 
explains that the “induc-
tively coupled” RFID tags 
used for this purpose were 
too large and expensive 
for widespread commer-
cial application. When the 
technology’s usefulness 
became clear, researchers 
began working constantly 
to make the technology 
smaller and cheaper. In 
the decades that followed, 
the smaller and more af-
fordable RFID technology 
became, the more regu-
larly we interacted with it.
Pet identi?cation mi-
crochips, automated toll 
payment (E-ZPass), and 
“chip-and-PIN” cards are 
just a few examples of the 
extremely versatile ways 
RFID has been imple-
mented in our daily lives. 
With pet microchips, 
which can be scanned at 
animal shelters to identify 
the owners of lost pets, 
RFID technology provides 
a reliable solution to a 
widespread problem. In 
the case of E-ZPass, which 
eliminates congestion by 
letting you drive through 
a tollbooth without stop-
ping, RFID functions as an 
automation tool, stream-
lining a previously te-
dious encounter. And on 
chipped debit and credit 
cards, which store your 
payment information not 
in a magnetic stripe but 
on an RFID chip, RFID 
technology not only en-
ables contactless payment 
but also actively protects 
your data. The RFID chip, 
because it’s a tiny com-
puter, can have built-in 
cryptography protection. 
In this case, RFID is used 
to revamp an old system, 
making it elegant and far 
more secure.
New RFID innova-
tions are still being imple-
mented across the globe. 
According to AB&R, an 
area with great potential 
for RFID tags is the com-
plete replacement of the 
barcodes found on almost 
every consumer product. 
“RFID is similar to barcod-
ing in that data from a tag 
or label are captured by 
a device that stores the 
data in a database,” their 
website explains. “RFID, 
however, has several ad-
vantages over systems 
that use [barcodes].” 
While barcodes need to be 
manually scanned, with 
a scanner that needs an 
unbroken line of sight to 
read the code, RFID tags 
are scanned automati-
cally. 
When you check out 
a tagged library book, a 
reader embedded in the 
security gate scans the 
book’s tag as you exit the 
library. Many envision a 
similar system in grocery 
stores and other retail 
outlets, where a reader 
would scan the tags in 
your cart as you exit — 
completely eliminating 
the checkout line.

The Carnegie Mellon 
University women’s track 
and ?eld team competed at 
the Denison University Bob 
Shannon Invitational on 
Saturday, Feb. 3, and won 
the event for the second 
straight season with 118 
points.
The Tartans swept 
the mile run: sophomore 
Kate Reilly won the event 
in 5:17.93. Juniors Rose 
Ciriello and Wade Lacey 
?nished second and third 
in 5:27.71 and 5:29.69, 
respectively.
Sophomore Emmalyn 
Lindsey won the

SPORTS BRIEFS
SEXUAL ASSAULT, from A12
The blame lies 
undeniably with USA 
Gymnastics. The board of 
USA Gymnastics and, to a 
similar extent, the leaders 
of Michigan State, have 
covered up Nassar’s crimes 
since he began his work. 
Allegations date back 
over 20 years, but many 
victims are only just now 
w forward. Olympic gold 
medalist McKayla Maroney 
stated that USA Gymnastics 
paid her $100,000 to keep 
quiet about her allegations 
against Nassar. Michigan 
State processed misconduct 
claims in 2012 and 2014 
— neither were pursued, 
and both were dismissed. 
The people in power were 
desperate to keep Nassar 
in power as well, covering 
up scandal after scandal 
until they could no longer 
hold back the words of the 
women they had let down.
Nassar faces sixty more 
charges of sexual assault 
in a separate county in 
Michigan, after having 
already received his 
sentence from the ?rst case. 
The entire board of USA 
Gymnastics has resigned 
on the request of the U.S. 
Olympic Committee, and 
both the President and 
the Athletic Coordinator 
at Michigan State have 
resigned as well. These 
enablers of abuse will not 
face charges; they will not 
have to listen to the ac-
counts of the countless 
women they allowed to get 
abused. They will likely all 
?nd new jobs soon, with 
their role in this brushed 
under the table.
Sadly, America is just 
now learning how to 
address the way many 
powerful men abuse their 
power. The Larry Nassar 
case is hopefully the ?rst 
of many to bring down the 
men enabled and forgiven 
by society, and perhaps it 
will set a standard for the 
future. There is nothing 
that can bring back the 
years lost to Nassar’s abuse 
and no way to turn back 
time in order to save every 
single woman he violated in 
his of?ce, under the guise 
of medical expertise. Yet, 
perhaps this surge of men 
?nally facing consequences 
for their actions will allow 
victims, not only those from 
sports but countless women 
assaulted by men in power, 
to ?nally begin to heal.
BASKETBALL, from A12
The two teams ?nished 
with nearly identical ?eld 
goal percentages, with 
the Violets shooting 40.6 
percent from the ?eld 
(26-64), and the Tartans 
shooting 41.3 percent (26-
63).
On Sunday afternoon, 
the Tartans lost to the 
Brandeis Judges 60–52. 
The Tartans were led by 
Filiere’s 16 points and 
sophomore Laurel Pereira’s 
13 points. Mayberger led 
the Tartans on the glass 
with 10 rebounds. May-
berger also led the team in 
assists, with ?ve, and steals, 
with four. Huffman and 
Higgins each recorded ?ve 
blocks.
The ?rst quarter 
consisted of back and forth 
possessions between the 
two teams, each trading 
baskets and the lead. With 
1:45 left to play in the 
quarter, a three-point shot 
by Filiere made the score 
17–12, the ?nal score of the 
?rst quarter.
Pereira started the 
scoring in the second 
quarter, and the Tartans 
led for the entirely of the 
quarter. They led by as 
much as 10 points, but the 
Judges ?nished the half 
with two buckets to cut the 
de?cit to six points, 33–27.
A 13–4 run by the Judg-
es in the third quarter gave 
them back the lead, 43–42, 
with 2:16 to go. The Judges 
held on to their lead, 
extending it to 12 points 
late in the fourth quarter 
on the team’s third three-
pointer of the period.
Both teams’ overall 
shooting ef?ciency was 
low, but the Judges im-
proved their shooting in the 
second half from 27.8 per-
cent to 32.4 percent, and 
made ?ve triples while the 
Tartans made only one. The 
Tartans’ team shooting fell 
to just 18.7 percent in the 
second half, allowing the 
Judges to come from be-
hind to take the victory.
The Judges also 
bene?ted from 24 points 
off the bench, while the 
Tartans contributed only 10 
bench points.
After the two games this 
weekend, the men’s basket-
ball team’s record moves 
to 1–8 in UAA play and 
9–11 overall this season. 
The Tartans will next host 
Emory University on Friday, 
Feb. 9 at 6:00 p.m.

On Jan. 24, former USA 
Gymnastics doctor Larry 
Nassar was sentenced to 40 
to 175 years in prison. Over 
150 of his victims spoke in 
court, and the total number 
of accusers has risen to 
nearly 300 young women. 
He has been a criminal 
since his years at Michigan 
State University to his rise 
as the leading doctor of USA 
Gymnastics. Victims have 
said they merely believed 
his abuse was how doctors 
typically worked, as they 
were exposed to him when 
they were as young as six.
As the Time’s Up move-
ment takes off in Holly-
wood, the importance of 
eradicating sexual assault 
by men in all positions 
of power cannot be 
understated. From poli-
ticians to producers to 
doctors, sexual assault 
is an epidemic among 
powerful men across many 
professional ?elds. As 
reported by The New York 
Times, since the fall of 
Harvey Weinstein, 51 men 
in Hollywood and politics 
accused of sexual assault 
have resigned, been ?red, 
or experienced serious 
professional fallout. This 
“Weinstein Effect” has not 
yet fully permeated into the 
sports world.
Nassar’s case is unique, 
not only for the vast number 
of women speaking out, but 
also for the court decision. 
Most cases of sexual assault 
in sports never make it past 
rumors: cases are usually 
settled quietly outside of 
court, and accusers often 
retract their statements. 
It happened with Los 
Angeles Lakers star Kobe 
Bryant, with Pittsburgh 
Steelers quarterback Ben 
Roethlisberger in 2009 and 
2010, and with Chicago 
Blackhawks forward Patrick 
Kane in 2015. Claims of 
sexual misconduct and 
domestic assault seem to be 
in every sport, from football 
to golf to gymnastics, but 
are swept under the rug.
This is the horror 
expected by victims of 
sexual assault. A crime is 
reported, one that changed 
the victim’s life forever, 
and their abuser is allowed 
to walk away with his life 
and reputation intact. The 
Nassar case changes things.
The unprecedented 
number of victims and the 
explicit description of the 
crimes committed brought 
justice to almost 300 
women. But if there were 
so many victims and the 
assault was so damaging, 
why did it come out just 
now? Why were allegations 
only leveled against Nassar 
within the last two years, 
after the Indianapolis Star 
released a story about the 
?rst two accusers?

This past weekend, the 
Carnegie Mellon women’s 
basketball team faced off 
against two University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
rivals, the New York 
University (NYU) Violets 
and the Brandeis University 
Judges.
In front of an excited 
home crowd at Skibo 
Gymnasium, the Tartans 
battled the Violets in a nail-
biting game on Friday, Feb. 
2. The game came to the 
?nal seconds of the fourth 
quarter, with the Tartans 
ultimately falling 68–63 
to their University Athletic 
Association (UAA) rivals.
Three Tartans scored 
in the double digits, with 
sophomore McKayla Filiere 
leading the way with 
23 points. Sophomore 
Katharine Higgins followed 
with 15 points and nine 
rebounds, while ?rst-year 
Kylie Huffman dropped 10 
points off the bench and 
added four blocks. Junior 
Jenn Mayberger led the 
team with nine rebounds 
and six assists.
The Violets got on the 
scoreboard ?rst with a 
quick layup and held off the 
aggressive Tartans squad 
for most of the ?rst quarter. 
With 3:44 left in the 
quarter, Filiere hit a three-
point shot to make the score 
10–8 and take the ?rst lead 
of the game for the Tartans. 
The Violets responded with 
a 7–0 run in the next two 
minutes, and led 17–2 at 
the end of the quarter.
Th teams traded baskets 
for much of the quarter, 
the Tartans keeping the 
lead within reach. A layup 
by sophomore Megan Jaeb 
after an offensive rebound 
gave the Tartans their 
second lead of the game, 
26–25. Late in the quarter, 
the Violets tied the game 
and soon pulled away, and 
led 34–28 at the half.
Coming out of half-
time, the Tartans stayed 
aggressive, their defense 
keeping them in the game. 
Feeding off the defense, the  
offense came alive, surging 
to a 39–36 lead after an 
11–2 run capped off by 
a layup from sophomore 
Laura Ochsner. The Violets 
fought to tie the game 48–
48 at the end of the third 
quarter.
Bursting into the fourth 
quarter, the Violets scored 
?ve straight points to take a 
small lead over the Tartans. 
With 2:41 left to play, the 
Violets led by seven points. 
The Tartans scored ?ve 
straight points of their own 
to cut the de?cit to two. 
A layup from Huffman 
brought the Tartans within 
one point with 13 seconds 
to go. Down by three points, 
two missed three-point 
attempts forced the Tartans 
to foul with two tenths of a 
second left in the game. A 
?nal two free throws ended 
the game, the Violets taking 
the win 68–63.

Nassar case signals shift in sexual assault discourse 
Discontinuing Indians’ Chief Wahoo is only the ?rst step
CALEB MILLER

Can you imagine cheer-
ing for a team called the 
“New York Jews” or the “San 
Francisco Chinese?” What 
about wearing a hat whose 
logo is an exaggerated 
stereotype: a yarmulke-
wearing big-nosed man or 
an excessively slant-eyed 
man donning a conical hat?
Just thinking about 
these hypothetical teams 
is uncomfortable, but 
one ethnic group, Native 
Americans, is commonly 
used as professional sports 
teams’ mascots throughout 
the U.S. The Washington 
Redskins in the NFL has 
received a lot of ?ak over 
the past several years for 
their blatantly racist name, 
while the Atlanta Braves 
and the Cleveland Indians of 
Major League Baseball, the 
Chicago Blackhawks of the 
NHL, and the NFL’s Kansas 
City Chiefs have also 
been criticized, 
albeit to a lesser 
degree. The 
Cleveland 
Indians 
made a 
major step 
towards rec-
tifying their 
team’s offen-
sive branding 
this past week.
Last Monday, MLB 
announced that after the 
2018 season — due to get 
underway on March 29 — 
the Indians will discontinue 
their “Chief Wahoo” logo. 
The logo has long been 
criticized for the way it 
depicts Native Americans 
as a racial caricature, from 
its bright red skin to the 
feather poking up from its 
hair. The mascot, originally 
appearing with yellow skin 
and a thinner face in 1948, 
changed to its current form 
in 1951 and has long been a 
point of contention. Native 
American groups have 
argued for years that the 
logo is derogatory, while 
some diehard fans have 
defended it. Increasing 
pressure from MLB 
commissioner Rob Manfred 
over the past year prompted 
the Cleveland club to ?nally 
make a change.
The Indians had already 
been shifting away from the 
logo for a few years now, 
using the simple “block-C” 
logo more frequently. After 
2019, Chief Wahoo will 
disappear from all of?cial 
uniforms and signs at their 
stadium, Progressive Field. 
Fans, though, will still be 
able to purchase Chief 
Wahoo merchandise at the 
team’s shop and in retail 
stores throughout Ohio. 
The team will also keep 
the trademark and 
still pro?t off of Chief 
Wahoo merchandise, 
although MLB 
claims this is 
an attempt 
to prevent 
businesses 
from using 
the logo 
in negative 
ways.
While the 
removal of Chief 
Wahoo is a crucial 
victory for Native 
Americans, there is 
still a long way to go be-
fore the exploitation of Na-
tive Americans for mascots 
is entirely eradicated. 
Redskins owner Dan 
Snyder and the NFL have 
both opposed changing the 
team’s name, despite it be-
ing widely considered the 
most offensive example. 
Although the Braves and 
the Chiefs have slightly less 
insensitive names, they 
have drawn criticism for 
their fan cultures. Braves 
fans perform the “toma-
hawk chop” to intimidate 
other teams — fans chant 
to loud music and simulate 
the action of using a toma-
hawk with their arms. The 
Chiefs’ pregame ritual in-
volves a cheerleader riding 
onto the ?eld on a horse 
named “Warpaint” waving 
the Chiefs ?ag while a spe-
cial guest bangs on a mas-
sive drum.
While the Chief Wahoo 
logo will soon be gone, 
this is simply the ?rst long-
awaited step that the other 
sports teams must follow. 
This is not a matter of being 
politically correct. This 
is a matter of removing 
blatantly racist imagery 
and cultural appropriation 
from nationally known 
institutions that feed into 
the enduring stereotyping 
and dehumanization of 
Native Americans in the U.S.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team 
played two games against 
University Athletic 
Association (UAA) rivals 
this past weekend, the 
New York University (NYU) 
Violets on Friday, Feb. 2, 
and the Brandeis University 
Judges on Sunday, Feb. 4. 
The Tartans split the games, 
falling to NYU 71–59 and 
defeating Brandeis 72–58.
Against the Violets, three 
Tartans scored double digit 
points, led by junior Patrick 
Ehland with 14 points off 
the bench. Ehland also led 
the team in rebounds, with 
seven. Sophomore Colin 
McNeil posted his ?rst 
career double-double, with 
10 points and 10 assists, 
which also led the Carnegie 
Mellon squad. Sophomore 
Zach Howard also added 10 
points in the loss.
The Tartans opened 
the game strong, going on 
a 9–2 run to set the tone 
early. The Violets responded 
immediately with their own 
14–1 run in the next ?ve 
minutes to establish a 16–10 
lead over the home team. 
The momentum shifted to 
the Tartans, who took back 
the lead 22–18 with a 12–2 
run, with seven of the points 
from junior Seth Henry. 
Seven straight points gave 
the Violets back the lead, 
who held on to end the half 
leading 31–28.
Ehland scored the ?rst 
points of the second half, 
tipping in his own missed 
layup. Continuing the 
back-and-forth runs of the 
?rst half, the second half 
began with a 11–4 run by 
the Tartans. After trading 
baskets for the next couple 
possessions, Ehland’s layup 
tied the game at 45–45. 
Over the next eight minutes, 
the Violets put together a 
17–6 run for an 11-point 
lead. With 2:13 left to play, a 
free throw by Ehland cut the 
lead to seven, but the Violets 
built on their lead and 
?nished the game 71–59.
The Tartans record-
ed more second chance 
points, points in the paint, 
and bench points than the 
Violets, but suffered from a 
lower ?eld goal percentage 
(37.3 percent to the Violets’ 
46.4 percent).
Four Tartans recorded 
double digit points 
against the  Brandeis Judges 
on Sunday. Sophomore 
Trent Suddeth led the 
way with 15 points and 10 
rebounds, on his second 
career double-double. 
McNeil and Howarth scored 
11 points apiece, while 
McNeil also dished out a 
team-high ?ve assists, and 
senior Ryan Maha added ten 
points.
The Tartans began the 
game hot, scoring seven 
straight points on their 
way to a 20–4 run, which 
included four consecutive 
three-pointers, over the ?rst 
seven minutes of the ?rst 
half. The Tartans defense 
did not let the lead fall 
below 10 points. The home 
team entered the half with 
the score 45–24.
An 11-2 run early in the 
second half helped the Vio-
lets cut the Tartan’s 21-point 
lead to a 12-point lead. At 
the midway point of the 
half, a layup by Howarth 
sparked 11 straight points 
for the Tartans to make the 
score 66–44. The Tartans 
would not relinquish the 
lead, ultimately winning the 
game 72–58.
An overall 48.3 ?eld goal 
percentage for the game 
gave the Tartans the edge 
over the Judges, who shot 
35.6 percent from the ?eld. 
The Tartan’s 35 percent 
three-point percentage 
compared to the Judges’ 
26.3 percent also helped the 
Tartans secure the win.
With their win against 
Brandeis, the ?rst since 
December, the Tartans broke 
a 10-game losing streak and 
move to 5–15 on the season 
and 1–8 in UAA play. The 
team will return to Skibo 
Gymnasium to host Emory 
University  on Friday, Feb. 9, 
at 8 p.m.

On your freshman summer
Dear Izzy,
There seems to be only one thing on the minds of 
everyone around me these days, except mine, and 
that’s their freshman summer. More specifically, 
jobs. My friends are worrying about their resumes 
and stressing out about interviews; some are even 
choosing which, of their many internship acceptance 
letters, to reply to with an enthusiastic YES. My 
parents are constantly nagging me and pushing 
me to start applying for jobs and to put myself 
out there to get experience, and they just keep 
stressing that “THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU,” but 
they’re honestly just making me more stressed 
about everything. So, now I’m sitting here, in 
my room, freaking out about if my résumé looks 
good enough and poring over company research to 
impress recruiters at the job fair. I’m worried if I’m 
actually going to be able to get any internships this 
summer, or if my grades are high enough to get 
me those internships. And I don’t want to waste 
my whole summer doing nothing. What do I do?
Just Only Beginning Lengthy Experience Search, 
Struggling
Dear JOBLESS,
There are two terrible things about job season: 
the pressure and stress of the people around you, 
and the frustration and pressure you feel because 
of your friends’ stress and of how, when you think 
about it, short job season actually is. However, job 
season goes by surprisingly quickly, and you’re 
taking all the right steps to prepare for a job fair 
(even if you do feel a little rushed).
But, I’m not gonna lie, it will be hard to waste your 
whole summer doing nothing – mostly because 
there are so many options for things to do. And, 
in my opinion, they’re all pretty fun and interesting 
too.
Carnegie Mellon is a great place to be during 
the summer. Carnegie Mellon offers a bunch of 
summer classes in popular courses, and gives you 
an opportunity to take classes that you wouldn’t 
be able to take during the school year. Carnegie 
Mellon also constantly advertises pre-college jobs, 
so applying for one of those positions is also a 
great option. You can also ask your professors to 
see if they will need research assistants over the 
summer. In short, you’ll be able to work with a 
professor or grad student on their study and learn 
a lot more about what Carnegie Mellon faculty 
work on outside the classroom. Additionally, 
Pittsburgh summers are a lot nicer than Pittsburgh 
winters, and the weather ranges from nice, 
sunny, and perfectly temperate to a boiling but 
welcomingly hot.
You can also plan to go abroad, either to study 
or apply for an internship. A few study abroad 
programs have summer terms and give you the 
option to take classes, hold internships, or even 
both. Most students who study abroad, during 
any term, only take two classes, along with their 
internship. However, that still gives you a lot of time 
and a lot of great opportunities for you to explore 
the city – and the continent – around you and 
immerse yourself in a new culture.
But in all honesty, it is perfectly OK to take a 
break and relax during your freshman summer. It’s 
perfectly OK to return to your old summer job in 
your hometown and to just have a great time with 
your friends and family. In your future, you’ll get 
internships and jobs in a bunch of different places 
far away from your home, and you may not get 
a moment soon to see all your family and friends 
together again in one place. So, take a moment 
this summer to pause, reflect, and take a breather 
from your first jam-packed year of college, from the 
comfort of your own home.
Hope these options help,
Izzy
Aisha Han | Contributing EditorBrunch Buddies: The Yard Shadyside
Last weekend was a bit crazy. In addition to our 
narrated experience at Mario’s in the previous 
edition of The Tartan, I also imbibed some whiskey 
on Thursday and wine on Saturday. In an effort 
to tone down a developing habit, my friends 
and I decided to treat ourselves to a weekend 
brunch instead. It’s the perfect setting for a 
good time where drinking is not the only social 
activity available, but it is at the same time wholly 
welcomed. And the perfect place for both booze 
and brunch? The Yard.
The location: Its location is prime for the Shadyside/
Squirrel Hill dweller like myself. Located on 
Bellefonte Street, right off of Walnut Street, The 
Yard sits next to a parking garage and across from 
a parking lot, giving drivers plenty of options. It’s 
also easily accessible by foot from campus or by 
the 71 bus. It is situated among shops, boutiques, 
and bakeries, giving the perfect opportunity for 
late morning leisurely strolls and window shopping.
The drinks: I was a little tired out from drinking, 
so I can’t speak on the cocktails they offered. 
However, we did notice they were a little on the 
expensive side. If you know you can drink your 
fill, though, they do offer bottomless mimosas for 
$15. That’s a decent deal if you deal your cards 
right. For slightly cheaper, you can help yourself 
to a Bloody Mary bar! The variety of drinks The 
Yard has is admirable. In addition to the brunch 
menu, anything from the lunch menu is available 
as well, making it possible for you to order 
one of their dozens of draft beers. They offer 
appropriate coffee-flavored concoctions as well, 
from a vanilla bean coffee cocktail to rum-spiked 
cold brew.
The vibe: The Yard is definitely not the classic 
brunch atmosphere — it lacks the white walls, all 
glass, avocado toast aesthetic. It’s casual and 
laid-back, with the music playlist they would 
use during lunch or dinner time still playing. We 
didn’t mind that at all. Young adults around were 
enjoying themselves, and the room was playful 
but not too loud. We sat at a corner table that 
awarded us some privacy and comfort, but we 
still were able to enjoy the vibe.
Lit or nah: The Yard is known for having some 
lit moments — it’s iconic for its trivia nights. But 
with brunch, I think people are sleeping on 
that. Their brunch menu is extremely good with 
a balance of savory and sweet classics. My 
chicken and waffles dish was the bomb, and 
their beignet pancakes were poppin’. The crowd, 
however, was minimal. You can always play it 
safe and call in for a reservation. That could 
be a good thing if you’re trying to get a table, 
but there were plenty of seats open. I don’t 
think people know about the lit-tential of their 
brunch experiences without going to The Yard. 
Definitely give this place a try next time the line 
for Pamela’s is a bit too long.
Mimosas bring all the boys to The Yard.

On any random day circa 2015, there 
existed the off chance everyone could find a 
contemporary cultural icon to relate to. With 
players such as Kanye, J.Lo and even Ru Paul 
on scene, the feeling of a diverse norm within 
the entertainment industry seemed almost 
guaranteed, even if it would only come to 
fruition in a distant future. Yet, over the past 
few months, BROCKHAMPTON and their many 
artistic ventures have proven that this diverse 
future within the arts may come sooner than 
we believed, and all at the hands of the same 
generation demanding it.
It was a cold day in Philadelphia when I arrived 
for the BROCKHAMPTON concert; the winds 
were rough, the snow steadily falling, and the 
sun hidden deep behind gray clouds overlooking 
the city. The streets were barren apart from the 
few pedestrians that hurriedly rushed to their 
destination in an attempt to avoid the frigid 
outdoors, but in an alleyway some fifty feet 
away from the Theatre of Living Arts there sat a 
group of twenty or so kids patiently withstanding 
the weather for one purpose. Approaching this 
group, one thing became clear: there is no room 
to question that they are a part of something 
much larger than music.
Anyone who has witnessed the line for a 
BROCKHAMPTON concert will tell you that they 
are not merely concert-goers. Being a fan of 
music means you delight in the art, but being a 
fan of a boy band means you’re a part of the 
culture, and those who follow BROCKHAMPTON 
exemplify this well. Diverse, unique, and curious, 
the fans that gathered to watch the show 
portrayed a new generation in nearly every 
sense. Finding each other through the internet, 
just as BROCKHAMPTON did themselves, their 
bonds transcended age or geography. Instead 
their relationships were formed under the similar 
beliefs that attracted them to the boy band in 
the first place. These were the outcasts, the 
unacknowledged, and often ignored kids of 
communities ranging all over. These were the 
people of color who felt unsafe and unwanted, 
the groups who didn’t fit into the norms of 
their communities, the gay kids who lived in 
homophobic environments, and everything in 
between. These were kids who had taken a 
step back and realized they disagreed with 
their homes, their states, and their societies and 
wanted to make a change.
“Question everything,” they reminded me, 
quoting the very name of the group’s label and 
diving deep into discourse about these notions 
of identity. It is not easy to find a fandom that so 
consistently engenders the group they follow, yet 
BROCKHAMPTON’s fanbase does so to a “T,” 
always able to relate to someone’s experience 
out of the 14+ member boy band. Every hour 
that led up to the show seemed to only make

---------------------------------------------------

the fans grow more wild with excitement, 
and, when the show opened, the feeling in 
the air was palpable.
Sometimes what you need most is tangible 
proof that the world is changing to begin 
believing it. Through their work, their 
actions, and the space they are creating, 
BROCKHAMPTON mirrors a growing 
generation of people no longer willing to 
wait for the art they consume to represent 
them. Instead they exemplify the future they 
desire and share it through the means of 
their talents. BROCKHAMPTON’s music has 
become an anthem to those groups that 
have been ignored and underrepresented 
and their fandom a refuge for those without 
a space or community willing to accept 
them. Their music gives those who seek 
representation words to scream, to sing, and 
to cry out, feeling unity in knowing they are 
a part of something larger while doing so. 
It is a cultural manifesto expressed through 
the art of their craft, and it is already visibly 
taking shape in the crowds that attend their 
shows. Without realizing it, these fans have 
become the hand that propelled the group 
forward into the mainstream, allowing for 
a platform that has no choice but to give 
attention to those who previously lacked it 
and forcing the industry to question their 
standard. What becomes mainstream? What 
is accepted under that category? Abiding by 
what rules? Through what sacrifice?
It is through the power of people like the 
fans of BROCKHAMPTON that we can 
find representation in an industry that 
so persistently continues to lack it. It is 
important to acknowledge the necessity 
and brilliance of being spoken for by those 
who can and those who will do it justice: to 
thank not only the artists but also the culture 
that cultivates them and their message. 
BROCKHAMPTON and every fan that has 
allowed them the opportunity to shine exist 
as a product of a multitude of others that 
preceded them, all fighting for the same 
future. Let this stand as a love letter to every 
fan that follows an art which represents a 
revolution. Let this be a love letter to the 
growing generation of those who strive to 
create a platform in which success is possible 
for the underrepresented. This one’s for you.

---------------------------------------------------

Last week, a friend dragged 
me to a movie that she 
described as a “love story 
between a mute woman and a 
fish.” I was intrigued and had 
no idea what to expect. The 
Shape of Water turned out to 
be marvelous, an adult fairy 
tale swimming in truths about 
racism, homophobia, and the 
fear of the unknown.
The setting is Baltimore, 
Maryland. The time is the 
early ‘60s: America is in the 
grip of the Civil Rights move-
ment and at the height of the 
Cold War. While Washington 
is obsessed with finding new 
ways to stay a step ahead of 
the Soviets, many Americans 
view the “others” — those with 
different skin tones, sexual 
dispositions, or ideologies — 
with contempt.
Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is a 
mute, isolated and idealistic 
cleaning lady in a hidden, 
high-security government 
lab in Baltimore. She values 
routine and seems content 
with her stock in life. Every 
day, she wakes up in the eve-
ning, makes her hard-boiled 
egg, checks in with her room-
mate Giles (Richard Jenkins), 
a repressed gay unemployed 
artist, takes the bus to work, 
and arrives just in time for her 
chatty and protective friend 
Zelda (Octavia Spencer) to 
punch her in. All of this is 
upended when the “fish” is 
brought into the lab by cruel 
government agent Richard 
Strickland (Michael Shannon). 
The credits bill him as the 
“Amphibian Man.” He is 
a blue-skinned, humanoid 
amphibian kidnapped by 
Strickland from the Amazon, 
where the natives consider him 
a god.
Strickland and most of the 
facility view the Amphibian 
Man as a test subject to be 
weaponized. They want to 
study and dissect him, looking 
for secrets that might counter 
the Russians. Strickland,

Water

---------------------------------------------------

in particular, treats him with contempt and 
hatred, routinely torturing him to show 
dominance. Opposing Strickland is Robert 
Hoffstetler (Michael Stuhlbarg), a scientist 
with a secret agenda, who wants the creature 
studied in a more humane way.
Elisa, on the other hand, becomes fascinated 
with the Amphibian Man, sneaking into his 
chamber, and introducing him to things from 
her life — hard boiled egg and recorded 
music. Neither of them can speak to anyone, 
and this shared experience lets them read 
each other on a more primal level. They devel-
op an instant wordless bond. With time, their 
bond blossoms into love, leading to an inter-
species romance that is beautiful, because it 
is narratively challenging. It flies in the face 
of social, even moral acceptability, and is 
set in a time when interracial and same-sex 
relationships were viewed in the same way.
Save for a surrealistic dream sequence late 
in the movie, neither Elisa nor the Amphibian 
Man utter a single word. And yet, stolen 
glances, intimate body language, and the 
characters’ actions reveal their deep long-
ing to each other and to us. Sally Hawkins 
has done a truly incredible job with Elisa, 
spectacularly conveying her growth through 
the movie. She goes from being despondently 
content with her humdrum existence to facing 
down everything that is expected of her with 
a burning passion. She sneaks the Amphibian 
Man out of the lab in a daring escape and 
uses sign language to tell a clueless Strickland 
to f*** off in a poignant display of defiance. 
Hawkins has succeeded creating a multi-dimen-
sional character with strength and vulnerability 
— without a line of dialogue.
Another way to look at The Shape of Water 
is as a monster movie. The Amphibian Man is 
green, blue and scaly, sounds like an alien, 
and towers above the human characters. He 
also has a penchant for violence — he claws 
off two of Strickland’s fingers and eats Giles’ 
cat. And yet, like Frankenstein’s monster or 
Godzilla or Kong, we see him as a literal fish 
out of the water, in a hostile, bigoted environ-
ment, fighting to survive.
The real monster, however, is the human being 
responsible for the creature’s plight. Michael 
Shannon has a blast playing Strickland as a 
willfully ignorant isolationist — the classic ugly 
American. He is humorless, intimidating, and 
regressive. In an early sequence, he makes 
fun of Elisa for being mute to her face, assum-
ing she is also deaf. A little later, he calls her 
to his office and aggressively propositions her. 
He is openly contemptuous to those beneath 
him, virulent to those unlike him, and obsessed 
with impressing those above him. He even 
starts to look like a monster when he reat-
taches the fingers the Amphibian Man cut off. 
They turn gangrenous and drip with pus for 
the rest of the movie.
As is expected with a Guillermo Del Toro 
movie, the cinematography and set, and sound 
design are out of this world. The visual palette 
itself is full of deep, oversaturated blues and 
greens — in hand soap, in Jello molds, in bath-
room tiles and on the creature itself — and is 
evocative of the inherent mystery and romance 
of the ocean. The camera pans gracefully 
between lush scenes, and Alexandre Desplat’s 
score has a warm fluidity. This creates a sense 
of buoyancy that keeps a viewer from getting 
bogged down in the movie’s weightier themes.
The Shape of Water is Del Toro’s most 
impressive work since Pan’s Labyrinth. It has 
been nominated for 13 Oscars, and I hope 
it wins a fair number of them. Go watch it if 
you’d like a delightfully bubbly and slightly 
weird romance that makes you believe in 
love again. Go watch it if you’d like a heady 
meditation on race, bigotry, inclusion, and 
sexual identity told through a breathtakingly 
simple metaphor. Just go watch it. It’s an 
instant classic.

FEARFUL SYMMETRIES
W
hen I first walked into Faith Wilding’s Fearful 
Symmetries exhibit at the Miller Gallery, the first thing 
that caught my attention was a television screen. On the 
screen was Wilding, rocking back and forth in a chair as she 
recites her monologue, “Waiting.” In the monologue, Wilding 
lists everything she is “waiting for” at different stages in her 
life, from her “first date” to her “baby to stop crying” to her 
“first gray hair.” The piece purposefully illustrates the events 
of a woman’s life in a mundane, repetitive manner, as though 
a woman goes about her life always waiting for something 
to happen. As I watched and listened to Wilding perform on 
the screen, I started to feel a little emotional. Boiling down in 
such a way, the events of my life as a woman was eye-open-
ing and it reminded me how precious time really is. 
The other pieces in the Fearful Symmetries exhibit were just 
as thought-provoking, and they allow viewers to see the life 
and experiences of women from passionate, beautiful, and 
emotional perspectives. Wilding uses various media in her 
artwork displayed in the exhibit, from collages to drawings 
with colored pencil. 
The Fearful Symmetries exhibit has already travelled to several 
college campuses and art centers, and it was curated by 
Shannon R. Stratton. On Friday, Feb. 16 at 5 p.m., a talk with 
Faith Wilding herself will take place in the Miller Gallery. The 
event is free and open to anyone who is interested, so if you 
have time, definitely take advantage of this opportunity.

---------------------------------------------------

In keeping with tradition, this year’s 60th Annual Grammy Awards succeeded in elevating various artists to the international stage and failed in 
rewarding the safest of the bunch. For the second year in a row, an insulting winners pool was punctuated not a day later by infuriating comments 
from the top brass at the Recording Academy. Last year, after Adele’s forgettable 25 took the top honor of “Album of the Year” over the universally 
lauded Lemonade from Beyoncé, Recording Academy President Neil Portnow said, “I don’t think there’s a race problem at all.” Of course, there is a 
problem, as the last nine Album of the Year winners were all white.
This year, Bruno Mars broke the streak but did so in a fashion that was simultaneously frustrating and confusing. His album, 24K Magic, was a 
smashing success that took inspiration from the classic sound of artists like James Brown and infused it with modern pop. It’s a good pop album, and 
few contend this. However, the controversy here comes from the other nominees in the field: Lorde’s Melodrama, Childish Gambino’s Awaken, My 
Love!, JAY-Z’s 4:44, and perhaps most notably Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN. Lamar, who has now been nominated and lost three times for the night’s 
top honor, had the most critically acclaimed album of the year, the most commercially successful album in the field, and the largest cultural impact of 
any album last year. By most accounts, Lamar deserved the award. I think he deserved the award, especially given that his 2015 album To Pimp a 
Butterfly devastatingly lost at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards for Album of the Year to Taylor Swift’s 1989. Lamar was at 
least due for a conciliatory win, even if DAMN. had not been the best album in the field. Moreover, his performance to 
open this year’s ceremony was explosive, expertly crafted, daring, and incredibly well-performed. He seemed 
perfectly set up to win Album of the Year.
And then, Mars won “Best R&B Performance” over SZA. Then, he won “Song of the Year” and then “Record 
of the Year.” By the time the Album of the Year award was to be presented, it had become clear that Mars was 
going to win, and he did.
It is important to say here that Mars is the first person of color to win Album of the Year in nearly a decade, and 
as far as pop albums that have won the award in years past, 24K Magic is unquestionably better than most. 
It is the fact that Lamar has now lost in the category for three consecutive albums, with each one being com-
pletely different from the last. It is the Recording Academy’s ceaseless rejection of hip-hop as a legitimate art 
form. Two rap albums have won the top award in Grammys history, the last time being in 2004 with Outkast’s 
Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. Lamar’s impact on hip-hop and music at large is undeniable, and he will go 
down as one of the best artists of this decade and likely the best rapper of his generation. Why then, do the 
Grammys refuse to reward the revolutionary artist graciously waiting for his chance to celebrate?
Another frustrating category was “Best Pop Solo Performance,” which went to Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” over 
four female nominees. Sheeran, who did not attend the ceremony, presented a song literally about the objectification 
of women’s bodies, while nominee Kesha attended and performed a show-stopping rendition of her song “Praying,” 
a powerful song about her survival of sexual assault and harassment at the hands of her former producer. Later, 
the only female Album of the Year nominee Lorde did not perform, as she was the only nominee for the night’s top 
honor that was not offered a solo performance slot. When asked if he thought the Grammys had a gender issue, 
Portnow replied that women should “step up” in order to receive more nominations and awards.
Of course, Portnow has been met with major backlash. He has since issued an apology and announced the formation 
of a gender task force to address the show’s continued issues. Now, given the long history of controversy under his 
tenure, female music executives are calling for Portnow to resign, and he should. The Recording Academy has contin-
ually failed to address the biases at the core of its process, and Portnow should be replaced by someone committed 
to equitable representation for artists of all races, genders, sexual orientations, and genres. Otherwise, ratings will 
continue to fall, and the Grammys will lose what little credibility it has left.
