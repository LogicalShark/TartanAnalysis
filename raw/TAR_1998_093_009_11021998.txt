School of Computer Science 
(SCS). There are a number of 
parts to this project, according to 
University Architect Paul Tell­
ers, including linking the space 
between Buildings C and D, reno­
vating and adding a floor to Build­
ing D, and constructing an en­
closed walkway from Building D 
to Wean Hall.

OLR features lottery system
By ISH HARSHAWAT
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Starting November 16, the way 
students use On-Line Registra­
tion (OLR) for the spring semes­
ter will be adjusted. Students 
will randomly be assigned time 
intervals of 30 minutes that start 
at 6 am and end at 4:30 pm. 
Students will only be able to start 
registering during this time in­
terval, but will be able to con­
tinue anytime afterwards 
throughout the day. The adjust­
ment is being made in the hope 
of improving the system’s per­
formance and'lessening the time 
it takes for individuals to com­
plete theregistration process.
“When we designed the sys­
tem, we were assuming that 
the students were going to dis­
tribute themselves across the 
day, and they didn’t,“ said Bill 
Elliott, vice-president of Enroll-The Purnell Center’s stage will be a state-of-the-art performing center once it is completed.
Interactive Theatre enters pilot phase
ment Services, “The system is 
not designed to have an infinite 
demand for a short period of 
time.”
Under the old OLR system, a 
large number of students logged 
onto the server at six o’clock in 
the morning, sometimes up­
wards of 1,000 students at once. 
Elliott said that a large number 
of these students weren’t even 
concerned with getting into high- 
demand courses. The overload 
on the system caused a lag ef­
fect, and students were forced to 
wait up to three hours to com­
plete the registration process. In 
order to resolve the difficulty, 
the OLR steering committee has 
deliberated since last April, try­
ing to find possible solutions to 
the problem.
An alternative would be to in­
crease the capacity of students 
who could log into the system at 
one time. The committee has
looked into this possibility, but 
current restrictions will not al­
low 1000 students to be on the 
system at one time.
“Other institutions that run 
similar systems have also encoun­
tered this limitation in terms of 
how many users can access the 
system at one time,” said Kyle 
Fisher-Morabito, assistant vice- 
president of Public Relations. 
“There is no institution that we 
know of that is able to accommo­
date 1000 users within a short 
amount of time.”
Fisher-Morabito said that 
based on simulations with the 
new OLR system versus the old 
one, statistics show that students 
vying for high demand courses 
will probably face the same 
amount of competition in their 
individual time interval as they 
had previously in the morning.

Awareness education for Carnegie 
Mellon’s employees has undergonè a 
face lift in recent months. The result is 
a new pilot program that provides first­
hand experience in workplace conflicts 
to viewers.
The Interactive Theatre Program is 
a forum designed mainly for faculty, 
staff, and administration to discuss 
difficult workplace situations. They 
watch actors perform skits about com­
mon conflicts and then discuss the 
actions they have seen. Organizers 
believe by turning workplace prob­
lems such as sexual harassment and 
racism into fictional accounts, people 
are better able to recognize and un­
derstand these situations without feel­
ing threatened.
After 18 months of preparation, the 
Interactive Theatre Program has be­
gun a two-week series of pilot presenta­
tions that are open to the CMU commu­
nity. Administration, faculty, and staff 
have been invited especially to observe 
and comment on the program. How­
ever, graduate students are also high­
lighted in one of the skits and are urged 
to come and fill out a survey on how to 
better the event.
The Interactive Theatre Program was
originally conceived at Cornell Univer­
sity as a tool to use in the work environ­
ment to talk about issues in a non-con- 
frontational manner.
In May of 1997 Patricia Laughlin, 
associate dean of CIT, Ingrid 
Sonnichsen, assistant professor of 
drama, and Rochelle Koch, a Human 
Resources representative, attended an 
Interactive Theatre workshop pre­
sented by Cornell University. Of the 13 
universities invited to attend the work­
shop, CMU is the only one employing 
this training technique according to 
Laughlin and Koch.
“Cornell was really the trailblazer in 
this form of training,” said Barbara 
Smith, assistant vice president for Hu­
man Resources.
Last spring, CMU brought one of 
Cornell’s scripts to campus for a mixed 
audience of faculty, staff, and students 
to see how it would be received. That 
first pilot series of the program went 
well, but those involved thought that 
the program should be more focused on 
CMU and Pittsburgh. The playwright 
for this second pilot series, Lynne 
Conner PhD, has been able to accom­
modate for the disjunction between 
the Cornell scripts and CMU with the 
new scripts.
CMU uses the Theatre in a broad 
manner, and it is meant for administra­
tion, staff, and faculty members of the 
University. Currently, three scenes 
are being presented by Human Re­
sources. Diversity, Chilly Climate, and 
Sexual Harassment are all dealt with 
in similar manners.
The format of the program promotes 
candid interaction in the three areas of 
each individual program.
The Diversity skit focuses on issues of 
race and stereotyping. Comments that 
may seem innocuous are shown as car­
rying more weight and making a deeper 
impact than individuals may realize.
Chilly Climate demonstrates the cu­
mulative effects of comments and acts 
that create sexual tension. Each inci­
dent stands alone as relatively minor, 
but as a pattern of behavior emerges, 
the effects of incidents accumulate.
The third skit addresses sexual ha­
rassment and the complications that 
arise from workplace relationships. It 
shows how using sex and relationships 
to manipulate or hinder other people 
constitutes sexual harassment.
“[The Interactive Theatrel creates 
an awareness and an ability to relate 
to a character or to someone else you 
may know,” said Koch. “When you see 
the Interactive Theatre you literally 
see how a behavior or a comment has 
an impact on a situation. You haven’t

campus is going to be over when 
the new Purnell Center opens 
its doors next year? Think again. 
An ambitious series of construc­

Republicans anticipate 
more seats in Congress
WASHINGTON (AP)—Republicans 
appear certain to increase their ma­
jority in the House and probably in the 
Senate as well in Tuesday’s elections 
¿s they exploit a multimillion-dollar 
advantage in campaign funds, a 50- 
•State survey shows.
Democrats seem headed for long- 
sought victory in the California 
governor’s race.
The Associated Press survey indi­
cated a range of likely GOP gains in 
the House from single digits to 20 or so 
seats, depending on the outcome of a 
relatively small number of close races 
scattered from Connecticut to Oregon.
In the Senate, the survey showed that 
Republican dreams of achieving a 60- 
Seat majority have faded. The final mar­
gin of the new edge hinges on the fate of 
a small number of incumbents facing 
Strong challenges, including Republi­
cans in North Carolina and New York 
and Democrats in Wisconsin, Nevada, 
South Carolina, and California. Both 
sides hope for victory in Kentucky, where 
GOP Representative Jim Bunning and 
Democratic Representative Scotty 
Baesler are vying for an open seat.
“This is going to be a long, sweaty 
night for both parties,” predicted 
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll­
ster. “There’s a chance that big things 
could be decided on the basis of very 
small victories.”
Voter turnout — historically low in 
midterm elections — will have a large 
impact on the results. In general, the 
lower the turnout, the more Republi­
cans are expected to benefit: Surveys 
indicate their supporters are more 
eager to go to the polls.
‘We’re still getting really low inter­
est levels in this election,” said Bill 
Mclnturff, a Republican pollster.
The survey indicated that several 
governorships may change hands. 
Linda Lingle is running strongly in 
her bid to become the first Republican 
governor of Hawaii since 1962, for ex­
ample, and Alabama Lieutenant Gov­
ernor Don Siegelman is ahead in the 
pre-election polls in his bid to unseat 
Republican Governor Fob James.
In California, Lieutenant Gover­
nor Gray Davis held the lead going 
into the final weekend of campaign­
ing in his bid to become the first 
Democratic governor in 16 years, 
according to pre-election surveys and 
strategists of both parties.
But California aside, Jeb Bush is 
well-positioned to add Florida to a 
collection of heavily populated states 
where Republican governors rule. 
Bush’s brother and possible presiden­
tial contender George W. Bush is a 
shoo-in for reelection in Texas, and 
Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, arid 
Michigan appear all-but-certain to stay 
in GOP hands.
Gubernatorial stakes are high for 
the two parties, since the men and 
women elected next week will have an 
important say in the redrawing of con­
gressional district lines to adjust for 
the census in 2000.
Perhaps the biggest unknown factor 
is voter reaction to President Clinton’s 
belated admission in August that he 
had an affair with .Monica Lewinsky 
and misled the nation about it.
“A month ago, it was the dominant 
thingin politics,” said Keith Fortmann, 
executive director of the Iowa Repub­
lican Party. “But it’s not there now.” 
Democratic Senator George 
Cunningham of Tucson, Ariz., agreed. 
“I think the issue with Clinton is off 
the radar screen” for most voters, he 
said. “They’re basically saying it’s the 
local issue that’s important with me.” 
Overall, the survey indicated that 
most incumbents of both parties at all 
levels can expect to coast to re-election 
in an era of economic prosperity.
That bodes well for Republicans, 
who hold majorities in both houses of 
Congress as well as a majority of 
statehouses.
Abortion clinics 
receive threats
INDIANAPOLIS (AP)—Federal mar­
shals stood watch Saturday over an abor­
tion clinic that received a letter claim­
ing, “You have just been exposed to 
anthrax.” Authorities meanwhile 
awaited results of tests on the 
envelope’s contents.
The Planned Parenthood clinic was 
one of four clinics around the country 
that got envelopes Friday containing a 
brown, powdery substance and threat­
ening notes. The others were in New 
Albany, In., Louisville, Ky., and Knox­
ville, Tenn.
On Saturday, a fifth clinic, in Wichita, 
Kan., reported receiving a letter post­
marked in Cincinnati, just like the 
others. An employee called the local 
fire department, which contacted fed­
eral authorities.
FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said the 
envelope wasn’t opened but “looking at
• it through backlighting, it doesn’t ap­
pear to contain anything at all.” The 
clinic was evacuated for about 
45 minutes.
Friday’s incident at the Indianapolis 
clinic prompted police to decontaminate 
31 people who were scrubbed down and 
treated with antibiotics at local hospi­
tals as a precaution. Two other people 
were treated at the Louisville clinic.
Preliminary tests on the contents of 
the Louisville and New Albany enve­
lopes were negative for anthrax, a strain 
of bacteria that can be used as a biologi­
cal weapon. Contents of a letter sent to 
the Knoxville Reproductive Health Cen­
ter will be sent to a lab for testing, the 
FBI said.
, Results of testing in the Indianapolis 
case had not been completed Saturday, 
FBI agent Doug Garrison said.
Genetic findings 
may help Clinton
(AP) — Thomas Jefferson really did 
father at least one child by his slave 
Sally Hemings, says a genetic study that 
a historian thinks will help Bill Clinton 
face an impeachment threat.
The study, organized by a retired 
medical professor after the idea came up 
over dinner, links Jefferson to the last of 
Hemings’ children, Eston.
Jefferson, who became president in 
1801, was accused publicly in 1802 of 
being the father of several of Hemings’ 
children. Scholars have been divided 
about whether to believe it.
Eston Hemings — who eventually 
took the name Eston Hemings Jefferson
— was born six years after the accusa­
tions surfaced, during Jefferson’s sec­
ond term. The genetic result implies a 
longstanding sexual relationship be­
tween Thomas Jefferson and Sally 
Hemings that probably began in the 
late 1780s, well after Jefferson’s wife 
died in 1782, said Jefferson scholar 
Joseph J. Ellis of Mount Holyoke Col­
lege in South Hadley, Mass.
Ellis co-wrote a commentary on the 
findings, which will be reported in 
Thursday’s issue of the journal Nature. 
He and gene expert Eric S. Lander of the 
Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Re­
search and the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology concluded that the new 
work, together with prior circumstan­
tial evidence, “seems to seal the case 
that Jefferson was Eston Hemings’ fa­
ther.” The genetic results will be pre­
sented in Nature by Dr. Eugene Foster, 
a retired pathology professor in 
Charlottesville, Va., and seven scien­
tists from Oxford and Leicester univer­
sities in England and Leiden University 
in the Netherlands.
Ellis, author of American Sphinx: The 
Character of Thomas Jefferson, said he 
figures the new study is good news for a 
more recent president with sex-scandal 
troubles.
Before the genetic study, the case for 
Jefferson’s paternity rested on evidence 
like physical resemblances between him 
and several of Hemings’ children, and 
the statement of one son, Madison, that 
his mother named Jefferson as the fa­
ther of all her children. She had at least 
five. Foster cautioned that his study 
doesn’t prove paternity.
The analysis found that the Jefferson 
Y chromosome was highly unusual, of a 
kind never observed outside the family. 
It matched the sample from the partici­
pating descendant of Eston Hemings.
Dalai Lama plans 
to visit U.S. soon
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Dalai 
Lama is planning to use a visit to Wash­
ington next month to make a concilia­
tory gesture toward China in hopes of 
restarting Tibetan-Chinese talks on 
autonomy for Tibet, his supporters say.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, at 
his Beijing summit with President 
Clinton in June, said “the door to dia­
logue and negotiations is open,” but 
only if the Dalai Lama acknowledges 
Tibet is an inseparable part of China 
and that Taiwan is a province.
The Dalai Lama has been meeting 
with advisers in his exiled government 
in India to craft a statement that might 
satisfy Jiang, and he is planning to 
deliver that formal response during his 
visit to Washington November 7-10, 
his supporters confirmed. The Dalai 
Lama is scheduled to make several pub­
lic speeches in the capital.
“There’s momentum there,” said 
John Ackerly, president of the Inter­
national Campaign for Tibet. He urged 
China to make its own conciliatory 
gestures by releasing Tibetan prison­
ers and relaxing control over monas­
teries and nunneries.
Lodi Gyari, special envoy to the Dalai 
Lama, noted that Jiang discussed Tibet 
“in a frank and open manner” during 
his news conference with Clinton, sur­
prising many Chinese and suggesting 
he’s willing to seriously talk about 
Tibet’s future.
Yu Shuning, a spokesman for the 
Chinese Embassy, said his government 
will be closely watching the Buddhist 
leader’s visit and his contacts with 
U.S. officials.
“So long as the Dalai Lama stops all 
his activities aimed at separating Tibet 
and China, then talks may be started 
between the Chinese government and 
the Dalai Lama,” Yu-said. “So we are 
going to see what he has to say and 
what he will do.”
The Dalai Lama, who fled his Hima­
layan homeland after a failed 1959 up­
rising against Chinese rule, has said he 
seeks greater autonomy — not inde­
pendence — for Tibet.
Iraq reopens dispute with U.N. by banning weapons inspections
BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) — Iraq 
announced Saturday it would cut 
off all dealings with U.N. weap­
ons inspectors, a move that could 
provoke a fresh showdown with 
the United Nations.
The decision by Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein and his top ad­
visors exempted only a handful of 
experts from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, who 
monitor suspected nuclear sites.
The ban was seen as a response 
to a U.N. Security Council deci­
sion Friday to review Iraq’s 
progress on eliminating prohib­
ited weapons. The council re­
buffed Baghdad’s demand that 
the review lead directly to the 
removal of the sweeping trade 
sanctions imposed in 1990 after 
Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait.
The Security Council was to 
meet Saturday to discuss the situ­
ation, a U.N. official said. Coun­
cil members were quick to con­
demn Iraq’s decision.
President Clinton’s national 
security advisors were reviewing 
the situation and consulting with 
allies and U.N. officials, said 
David Leavy, a spokesman for 
the U.S. National Security Coun­
cil. “We view this as a serious 
matter,” Leavy said.
The Iraqi statement said the 
ban would continue “until the 
United Nations looks at the is­
sue in an honest and positive 
way, leading to Iraq’s right to 
the lifting of the unjust sanc­
tions.”
Iraq also insisted that the Se­
curity Council fire Richard But­
ler, chief of the U.N. Special Com­
mission that oversees weapons 
inspections. Iraq has long 
charged that Butler is working
on behalf of the United States to 
prolong the sanctions.
Officials at the U.N. Special 
Commission in Baghdad declined 
to take calls and issued no state­
ments Saturday.
It remained unclear if Iraq’s 
decision would provoke the 
United States and Britain into 
threatening military action 
against Baghdad, as they did ear­
lier this year after the Iraqi gov­
ernment prevented U.N. inspec­
tors from entering Saddam’s 
presidential palaces.
A compromise negotiated in 
February by U.N. Secretary Gen­
eral Kofi Annan defused the 
threat of airstrikes, but the 
United States still maintains 
large forces in the Gulf.
Annan expressed deep concern 
over Iraq’s latest announcement. 
“Ifindeed the reports are right, it is
a serious breach and a major viola­
tion” of security council resolutions, 
the U.N. chief said in New York.
In London, a British Foreign 
Office official who spoke on cus­
tomary condition of anonymity 
said that a ban on weapons in­
spectors would be “totally unac­
ceptable.” Britain currently holds 
the council presidency.
The French Foreign Ministry 
said it “profoundly deplores” 
Iraq’s action and insisted that 
Baghdad resume full cooperation 
with the United Nations.
In Moscow, an official at the 
Foreign Ministry said there was 
nobody to comment on the move.
Russia and fellow council mem­
ber China previously have advo­
cated trying to finish the task of 
disarming Iraq so that sanctions 
can be lifted.
Saddam’s decision Saturday
caused jitters in Baghdad. The 
already depressed Iraqi dinar 
depreciated from 1660 to the dol­
lar to 1760 within minutes of the 
announcement, according to cur­
rency traders.
IraqiTrade Minister Mohammed 
Mehdi Saleh told reporters the 
country would stand firm.
“This is the decision of the 
people of Iraq and the leadership 
of Iraq to save the sovereignty of 
Iraq and the right of the people to 
live,” Saleh said.
Sanctions have severely dam­
aged the Iraqi economy by limit­
ing the sale of oil, banning air 
travel, and prohibiting most other 
financial dealings with Iraq.
The Iraqi Information Ministry 
issued a statement late Saturday 
saying the government was not 
asking the roughly 120 U.N. moni­
tors and support staff to leave Iraq.
It added that monitoring cameras 
and sensors installed at weapons 
sites could continue to operate.
Saturday’s decision deepens a 
dispute that began August 5, 
when Iraq announced that teams 
from the U.N. special commis­
sion and the atomic agency could 
no longer carry out surprise 
inspections.
The statement insisted that 
Iraq has complied with all re­
lated Security Council resolutions 
and blamed “America and its 
agents” for blocking the lifting of 
sanctions. The embargo cannot 
be lifted until the special com­
mission certifies that Iraq has 
eliminated its weapons of mass 
destruction. Iraq insists it has 
done so, but the commission al­
leges that Baghdad continues to 
hide information about possible 
biological and chemical weapons.

50 YEARS AGO—November, 
23, 1948 — The Carnegie Tech 
Tartans ended their longest los­
ing streak in the school’s football 
history with a 7-0 upset over 
Grove City in Pennsylvania. In 
celebration, the following Mon­
day classes were unofficially dis­
missed for a rally in front of the 
College of Fine Arts.
Automobile caravan raids to 
Grove City and fraternity parties 
ensued after the win the previous 
Saturday. Some students antici­
pated the dismissal of classes and 
left for an extended Thanksgiv­
ing vacation. The football game 
ended the Tartans’ season on a 
hopeful note.
25 YEARS AGO — November 
13, 1973 — A CMU alumnus 
named Bill Mogush was arrested 
outside the Three Rivers Arts Fes­
tival for displaying a four by six 
foot American flag painted over 
with a swastika and a represen­
tation of aborted babies. The flag 
also had January 22, 1973, the 
date of the Supreme Court deci­
sion to legalize limited abortion, 
painted on it.
Mogush had displayed the flag 
at the festival for three hours 
when the head of the festival 
asked him to remove it. He then 
moved the flag to the sidewalk in 
front of the festival and made a 
sign that said, “The flag is more 
sacred than human life.”
Within a half-hour Mogush was 
arrested by four policemen. He 
was scheduled to appear in front 
of a jury under charges of flag 
desecration. He strongly pro­
tested the charge, saying that he 
was using his artistic abilities to 
convey a message.
10 YEARS AGO— November 
8, 1988 — A computer virus 
spread through Carnegie Mell­
on by way of the Advanced Re­
search Projects Agency 
(Arpanet) network, the prede­
cessor to the Internet.
The virus was classified as a 
worm that spread through finger 
and mail systems on UNIX sys­
tems. The worm worked by copy­
ing itself repeatedly until it 
crashed the system. The problem 
was resolved when a system de­
signer plugged a security hole in 
the mail system that the worm 
was using.
FIVE YEARS AGO — No­
vember 1, 1993 — The Robotics 
Institute agreed to clean and 
upgrade Dante, an eight-legged 
robot designed to crawl into and 
explore volcanoes.
The repairs were done in order 
to prepare Dante for a mission to 
Mount Spun*, a volcano 80 miles 
west of Anchorage, Alaska. In 
addition to simply studying the 
volcano, the mission would be 
conducted to give NASA valuable 
research on the use of robots in 
interplanetary exploration.
ONE YEAR AGO — October 
27, 1997 — A fire on the roof of 
Wean Hall forced students and 
faculty to evacuate the building 
and end classes early.
Five roofers were repairing the 
roof when a propane tank fell over 
and came in contact with a torch 
they were using. Two workers 
suffered second degree bums and 
were taken to West Penn Hospital.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 2 November 19983:
University will continue building to meet future needs
CONSTRUCTION, from page 1
tion to Baker Hall. The addition 
will provide space for classrooms, 
multimedia teaching spaces, psy­
chology laboratories, and faculty 
offices. According to Tellers, the 
proposed wing will be in the same 
basic form as the existing wings of 
Baker Hall, with the same amount 
of space separating it from its 
neighboring wings. The new wing 
will connect to the building on all 
floors from the basement to the 
third. Seminar rooms and class­
rooms will be provided in an un­
derground space that is larger 
than the three floors of the wing.
The plan, which is estimated to 
cost $5-7 million, is still in the 
schematic design phase, and dif­
ferent layouts are being consid­
ered. According to Bolton, unlike 
the Building D renovations, indi­
vidual donors will most likely 
fund the Baker project.
Senior Project Manager Peg 
Hart is optimistic about the plan. 
“We have a schedule we are aim­
ing toward, but we need to get 
budget approval and design ap­
provals first,” she said. If fund­
ing and design fall into place, 
construction should begin this 
summer and finish by the sum­
mer of 2000.
Posner Gets Taller
The Baker Hall addition is not 
the only major project in the design 
phase, however. Soon, Posner Hall
may be getting taller. Plans are in 
the works to add another floor to 
the building, which houses the 
Graduate School of Industrial Ad­
ministration (GSIA). “Right now... 
we are in the programming phases 
of the project,” said Project Man­
ager PhilPopowitz. “We’re currently 
collecting information from the end 
users.” They will begin the sche­
matic design phase by January.
The GSIA addition will contain 
faculty and administrative offices 
and meeting rooms, and, barring 
design or funding issues, con­
struction is slated to begin this 
summer. According to Popowitz, 
steel erection should be complete 
by the beginning of the fall 1999 
semester, and the addition will 
be ready for use in the fall, 2000.
“It’s an aggressive schedule,” said 
Popowitz. “It’s workable but tight.... 
We’re trying to accommodate the 
program to the school’s schedule.”
As design progresses for the 
GSIA project, funding also seems 
to be falling into place. According 
to Bolton, in addition to some 
undetermined funds from the 
capital campaign, the project has 
received a $2 million commitment 
from the Bosch Institute.
“This brings us to the 50 per­
cent mark,” he said. “That should 
be sufficient to go ahead with the 
project.” The remainder of the 
funding for the GSIA expansion, 
which is estimated to cost around 
$4 million, will come from
fundraising and financing 
through the University. “Itis con­
ceivable that we would come up 
with a financing plan whereas 
GSIA would pay us back with , 
revenue from executive training ' 
and other sources,” said Bolton.
mately six weeks after that. “Our 
wish list would have had occu­
pancy at the beginning of the 
school year but that was never a 
part of the schedule,” said Murphy.
Currently, the main push at the 
Purnell site is to get the structure

The Purnell Center will feature structures similar to the UC.
Purnell Readies for Winter
The school’s most visible 
constrution project is also pro­
gressing. The Purnell Center' 
which marks the final major struc-; 
ture of the master plan, is moving 
on time and within budget.
Project Manager Tom. Murphy 
explains that the building will be 
substantially complete by August 
of next year, and the occupancy 
permit should be granted approxi-
enclosed for winter. “We’re prob­
ably three weeks away from the 
lastpartofmasonry,” saidMurphy. 
In addition, the installation of the 
building’s windows is progressing 
on schedule, which is a critical part 
of enclosing the structure.
The anchor of the Purnell Cen­
ter will be its massive theatre, 
which will seat over 400 people. 
Currently, work on the tension 
grid and seating area is progress­
ing on site, while the audio and 
lighting fixtures are being fabri­
cated at factories. When com­
pleted, the facility will be one of 
the most state-of-the-art perfor­
mance venues in the city.
Even before construction is 
complete on the main structure 
of the Purnell Center, plans are 
in the works for the next phase of 
the project. Purnell’s north wing, 
which will link the building with 
Warner Hall and make the 
building’s mirror image of the 
UC complete, will be the final 
stage in construction of the 
Purnell Center. “The north wing 
was always in the design plans 
[of the Purnell Center] but was 
never part of first phase of con­
struction,” said Bolton.
The north wing project is esti­
mated to cost $11.5 million. Cur­
rently, there is no timetable set 
for the project. “We do not have a 
firm commitment for funding of 
this facility,” he said. “I suspect 
that we will delay the project 
until funding falls in place.”
These projects, which will cost 
over $80 million total, still do 
not constitute the sum total of 
expansion plans for the CMU. 
Tellers explains that the master 
plan calls for a number of 
smaller, largely aesthetic 
projects. “When we see the 
completion of the Purnell Cen­
ter next year, it will clean up the 
most public front yard of the cam­
pus,” he said. To emphasize this;-;; 
plans are in the works for a new ;; 
entranceway to the University^;; 
from Forbes Avenue. According-;; 
to Tellers, it will consist of- a. 
drop-off turnaround for cars an'cP1 
busses, as well as steps and , 
ramps to both the UC and ’ 
Purnell. The current PAT bus \ 
stop will be moved toward Oak- , 
land and the existing landscap- •; 
ing and walkways will be re- ¦; 
placed. Currently, there is no ; 
schedule or budget for this plan. '
Adding New Dorms
In addtion, to keep up with the ; 
increased undergraduate enroll- ; 
mentat Carnegie Mellon, the school ' 
is still looking at building a 250 J 
person dormitory faculty between 
Mudge House and Morewood Gar- ; 
dens. This project has met with ; 
opposition fromresidents on neigh- ; 
boringDevonshire Road, who don’t ; 
want to see another large dorm J 
built in the area. “We think that a ", 
properly designed residence hall ; 
can both benefit our students and ¦ 
work well with the residents of ‘ 
Devonshire,” said Tellers.
With well over $100 million in ; 
construction on campus from ; 
1980 to the present, Carnegie ! 
Mellon has expanded and im- j 
proved at an blazing rate. “We : 
can look around with pride at } 
what we were able to accomplish 
around here in the past few : 
years,” said Tellers.
Administration implements 
change to help registration
OLR, from page 1
sections that they want,” said 
Elliott. “Carnegie Mellon does 
not offer enough of a particular 
course to meet 100 percent of the 
course demand 100 percent of 
the time. I don’t think any sup­
plier can do that.” Enrollment 
Services assures students that 
the system will allow them to 
fulfill their primary major re­
quirements during the course of 
their academic careers. The sys­
tem should also accommodate 
electives and requirements for 
additional majors and minors.
The OLR committee encour­
ages students to stay on 
waitlists for courses that are 
full. Departments are interested 
in the demand for courses and 
might change the availability of 
courses for a semester based on 
the demand.
“It’s best overall because it un­
clogs the system, but it seems 
unfair for the people assigned at 
a later time,” said Wendy 
Bartholomew, a senior in com­
munication design.
A committee designed to 
reengineer the enrollment pro­
cess started the OLR project 
three years ago. Currently, there' 
are no students on the -board
that makes decisions for OLR, 
but the committee has tried to 
make an effort to gain student 
input from various student ad­
visory councils. In addition, the 
committee read email received 
through the OLR feedback. John 
Papinchak, vice president of 
Enrollment Services, said, “The 
message was clear from stu­
dents: Tou said it was going to 
be quick and easy, and it isn’t 
quick and easy.’ ”
Previously when a large num­
ber of students were on-line, the 
system would pick them randomly 
to register for a course. “For the 
students who are trying to get into 
courses where the demand issue 
is not so high, they will have an 
improved experience,” said 
Morabito-Fisher. “At least now it 
will be quick and easy.”
“There could’ve been more in­
put,” said Ernie Pusateri, a jun­
ior electrical and computer engi­
neering major. He also added, “It 
shouldn’t matter what time you 
wake up — even if you do get up 
at six, it’s still random.” 
Morabito-Fisher believes that 
for the students who woke up 
early to get high-demand 
courses,- there is no indication 
that it will be easier or harder to
register for classes under the 
new system.
“[The system! doesn’t address 
the main concern,” said Jason 
Martin, a senior in psychology 
and a member of the Vícq: 
President’s Student Advisory 
Council. “Students still don’1 
have control of what classes they 
need. Before they could at least 
get up early.”
Registration for spring semes,- 
ter begins on November 16 for 
seniors, and each subsequent 
day will allow for the other yearp 
in descending order to register. 
Students will be given a time, 
which will be the earliest pos­
sible time to register, and will 
be able to use OLR anytime af­
terwards. The intervals start at
6 am and end at 4:30 pm. There 
will be a temporary limitation 
for students in a higher class to 
access OLR while a lower class 
is registering during the foui- 
day period of initial registra­
tion. In addition, the time 
scheme works as a cycle from 
one semester to the other. Stu­
dents will receive an earlier 
start time each subsequent se­
mester, while the students start­
ing at the earliest possible time 
will be given a later time. j

4The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 2 November 1998
Carnegie Mellon hopes to 
provide ADSL to students
By SRIRAM GOLLAPALLI
Tartan Staffwriter
A few years ago Computing 
Services thought about new op­
tions to connect off-campus resi­
dents. Charles Bartel, the direc­
tor of operations, met with Bell 
Atlantic in Washington, D.C. to 
discuss the potential for new 
high-speed connections at Carn­
egie Mellon.
A trial service for Asymmetric 
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) 
started in July, 1997, for 100 
Carnegie Mellon community 
members located in the Squirrel 
Hill and Oakland areas. The par­
ticipants included an even distri­
bution of faculty, staff, under­
graduate and graduate students. 
ADSL uses standard phone lines 
to deliver high speed data. ADSL 
uses a part of the phone line that 
is not being used by voice. This 
allows for simultaneous voice and 
data transmission.
“It was a technology trial, and 
the ending date was extended to 
December 31,1998,” said Bartel. 
“We were very pleased with the 
service. There were 1.5 megabits 
per second going down to the resi­
dence and 64 kilobits per second 
back up to the network. We are 
working on a deal to offer it as a 
regular service to the Carnegie 
Mellon community.”
All campus dormitories are 
wired with IBM Category 5 wir­
ing. The wiring allows for 10 
megabit per second throughput 
in the network. Currently, off- 
campus residents do not have 
access to such a network, and 
must dial in to different modem 
pools. There is an 56.6kbps mo­
dem pool, a 28.8kbps pool, and a 
14.4kbps pool. Bartel said that 
the pools are operated on a fair 
use policy, where time is re­
stricted during peak hours and
unrestricted during off-peak 
hours. Despite this policy, the 
lines are often busy and present 
other problems to users.
“We are trying to increase 
other connected options and are 
working closely with Housing 
Services,” said Bartel. “We re­
cently wired Marybelle Apart­
ments with a link directly to 
the University. Housing Ser­
vices also invested in its own 
modem pool to reduce the load 
on the others.”
Other off-campus residents 
have voiced their concerns and 
optimism about the upcoming 
technology.
“A lot of my residents com­
plain that the only reason they 
do not like living here is be­
cause they have to use their 
modems to connect to the An­
drew computer network,” said 
Omari Teel, a resident advisor 
in Cathedral Mansions and 
sophomore computer science 
major. “ADSL would make a lot 
of them happy, and a lot more 
people would be willing to live 
in places like Fairfax, Cathe­
dral Mansions, Webster, and 
Amberson Apartments.”
“I think it would be incredible 
if we could have ADSL connec­
tions,” said Tim Simpson, a 
sophomore undeclared H&SS 
major. “It is incredibly inconve­
nient to share a single phone 
line between two people and two 
computers. It must be even worse 
for those people who live in the 
triple apartments. For a univer­
sity so dedicated to the exten­
sive use of its computer network 
and resources, I find it ridicu­
lous that our ability to connect to 
the network is so limited.” 
“First of all, being at Carnegie 
Mellon, a school which is so de­
pendent on computers and email 
to get work, submit homework,
and communicate with professors, 
I cannot believe that all residents 
do not have access to the ethernet 
connections,” said Jonathan Li, a 
first-year, student undeclared 
H&SS major. “As a resident in 
Cathedral Mansions, I have wit­
nessed firsthand how difficult it is 
to get connected. With two room­
mates and one phone line, we are 
constantly fighting over whose 
turn it is to check our email so 
that we can get our assignments 
for the next day. When I have to 
wait for the phone line to get free 
just so I can start my homework,
I get seriously disappointed in this 
school’s network. And as for phone 
calls, my family almost can never 
contact me because the phone lines 
are consistently tied up due to 
modem use.”
Computing services hopes to 
work out a deal with Bell At­
lantic over the next few weeks 
to offer ADSL at a subsidized 
rate to all off-campus residents. 
Bell Atlanic would install a 
splitter in the apartments which 
would split the data and voice 
on the same phone line. Carn­
egie Mellon would be the pro­
vider through Bell Atlantic in 
this deal to provide ADSL to 
the campus community.
“It would be an extended cam­
pus network to all the resi­
dents,” said Bartel.
Bell Atlantic also hopes to offer 
ADSL to the Pittsburgh general 
public. Based on the results of 
the trial at Carnegie Mellon, they 
have plans to roll out ADSL in 
the Pittsburgh area over the next 
few months.
As many students seek hous­
ing on their own in Pittsburgh 
this new service should prove to 
be valuable to off-campus stu­
dents. Bell Atlantic has delayed 
the release of ADSL to the gen­
eral public in the past though.
Program promotes awareness
THEATRE, from page 1
really felt that impact that 
closely before. You haven’t had 
the opportunity to engage 
[yourself].”
In addition to the audience 
being able to relate to the char­
acter, the uniqueness of each 
live session adds to its effec­
tiveness.
“Every session we have is dif­
ferent,” said Koch. “Every audi­
ence is different. There are dif­
ferent issues people feel strongly 
about. It makes it unique. It’s not 
like going to see the same movie 
over and over. It touches one’s 
emotions. This is a powerful me­
dia tool to learn with.”
Planning for the next step for 
the Interactive Theatre is still in 
its preliminary stages. Its future 
may involve incorporating com­
puters and their ability to re­
spond to human questions. This 
would allow individuals to use
the program independently, or 
at least on their own. Laughlin 
said that she was unsure of 
how this form of interaction 
will effect the program and how 
it functions now.
“I don’t personally believe 
we will accomplish all the 
same goals [without alive per­
formance],” said Laughlin. 
“Privacy could be very signifi­
cant [for individuals who do 
not feel comfortable].”

United Way 
seeks support
Carnegie Mellon has reached 
he halfway point toward its goal 
f contributing $140,000 to the
1 Jnited Way for 1998.
Donations from faculty, staff, and 
tudents to the United Way will 
elp to improve the quality of life 
¡31* the region’s children and youth, 
amilies, elderly, those with health 
leeds, and those facing disasters, 
inemployment and other crises.
“United Way represents a vast 
lumber of organizations that de- 
erve ours upport because their 
f/ork has a profound effect on the 
Ives of so many people,” said Presi- 
lent Jared L. Cohon. “The funds
raised in this campaign ensure 
that these vital social service agen­
cies can continue to meet the needs 
of the people of our community.”
Carnegie Mellon hopes to in­
crease the participation level 
this year. While University con­
tributions have increased over 
the years, participation rates, 
have been low. Last year only 
about 12 percent of the Univer­
sity community contributed to 
the cause.
Contributions will be accepted 
after December. For more infor­
mation, contact the Heinz

tin Prekop. “It is a pleasure to
honor our staff.”
Awards were given in four cat­
egories: Excellence in Job Perfor­
mance, Citizenship, Rookie, and 
Innovator. Each winner received 
a special check, certificate, and 
personalized chocolate card.
Robert Armitage, computer fa­
cilities manager for the School of 
Architecture, was rewarded with 
the Excellencein Job Performance 
award for producing quality work 
consistently and dependabty.
The Citizenship award went to 
Jennifer Brodt, administrative 
associate in the STUDIO for Cre­
ative Inquiry, for her exemplary 
citizenship and consistent dedi­
cation to the college.
The Rookie award,- given to a 
new staff person or a current staff 
person in a new position who had 
a great rookie year, went to Ray 
Schlachter, facilities coordinator 
for the School of Design, for going 
above and beyond his new re­
sponsibilities with quality work 
and a positive attitude.
Lori Holland, assistant head of 
the School of Drama, won the In­
novator award for her work in de­
veloping initiatives that improve 
school or college procedures and 
policies.

SURG program fosters 
innovation
Last week was the deadline to 
apply for a Small Undergraduate 
Research Grant (SURG) — one of 
the most valuable campus-wide, 
academic programs. The students 
who will receive SURGs this year 
are sure to benefit from them as 
well as enhance the program’s 
strong reputation in the Univer­
sity community. The SURG pro­
gram is proof of the University’s 
effort to strengthen its commit­
ment to undergraduates.
Any undergraduate enrolled in a 
degree-granting program is eligible 
to apply for a SURG from the Un­
dergraduate Research Initiative. 
To make it clear that the SURG 
program is open to all undergradu­
ates, it has been widely publicized. 
In addition to an annual poster 
campaign, students seeking funds 
for research projects can learn 
about SURG through faculty.
The wide variety of students 
who represent many different
does not necessarily encompass the 
research areas that first come to 
mind at CMU.
While the SURG program ben­
efits participating students, it im­
proves the community as well. Two 
examples of such improvements 
include the new campus signage 
and a Pittsburgh newspaper as­
sembled, run, and distributed by 
homeless people. The SURG pro­
gram made it easier for students 
to start these proj ects and for mem­
bers of the surrounding commu­
nity to benefit from them.
The Undergraduate Research 
Initiative is trying to get more 
money from the University so 
more SURG projects can be fi­
nanced. There is even a long-term 
goal to fund every proposal that 
faculty members think deserve 
merit. These efforts to build SURG 
into a prominent campus-wide 
program are an example of the 
way the University can come to-

Registration process 
still needs improvement
Editor:
I found it both interesting and sad that 
your story on the gay awareness vigil 
[“Vigil honors slain gay student,” 10/19] 
was juxtaposed with another story on 
defense training — for women only, ac­
cording to CMU officer Leon D. Mickens 
III [“Police offer defense training”]. Obvi­
ously, as a campus and a nation, 
we have a long way to go towards aware­
ness of the needs of gay people (men and 
women) today.

condemns anti-abortion violence
Since April, an Enrollment Ser­
vices committee has been work­
ing to solve some problems with 
Online Registration (OLR). As a 
result of the committee’s efforts, 
the HUB is preparing to imple­
ment a new methodology for OLR 
this semester. Instead of thousands 
of students flooding the OLR sys­
tem at 6 am, each student will be 
assigned a random start time over 
the course of their registration day 
when they will begin registering. 
While the administration should 
be commended for trying to solve 
the problems students had with 
OLR, they should have sought out 
more student input about the flaws 
in a program designed solely for 
student use. The new process does 
not serve student needs and will 
only be a quick fix to a problem that 
deserves réévaluation.
Randomly assigning students to 
different start times around the 
day does not improve their 
chances at getting into the classes 
they actually need. In fact, it puts 
them in less control of their sched­
uling efforts than before. At least 
with the old system, students 
knew if they got up early and 
tried to get classes that were im­
portant to them, they might have 
a chance of succeeding. With the 
new random lottery system, 
classes are made available to stu­
dents solely by chance.
The Enrollment Services com­
mittee asked a few students from 
various advisory boards for their 
opinions and took some feedback 
from the OLR site, but if they 
would have held a University- 
wide Town Meeting about OLR, 
more students could have given 
feedback about this issue.
It also seems strange that the 
Enrollment Services committee 
would try to redesign the way stu­
dents use OLR and not try to make 
any changes to the OLR system 
itself. It’s clear that students will 
still struggle with getting the 
classes they want using the new 
system, so a new system should be 
planned, one that features enough 
computing power to handle heavy 
traffic on the day of registration. 
Enrollment Services should be 
considering a variety of solutions 
to this problem, and testing these 
with small groups of students to 
see which is the most effective.
Enrollment Services gathered 
little student input as to what 
should be fixed with OLR to pro­
vide them with a better service 
and has done no testing to ensure 
that a system like this will actu­
ally improve things before un­
leashing it upon the student body. 
While it is important that OLR is 
efficient, it should not be taken as 
a priority over the service it must 
provide to the students.

The freedom to c 
whether to reproduce is 
fundamental right. Imgine 
a scenario in whiph a w iman 
gets raped andxis thi im­
pregnated. She is abso:
justified in wanting to abort 
such a child. What if giving 
birth to a child can seriously 
endanger the life of the mother? 
The mother should not be re­
quired to sacrifice her life in 
order to give birth to a child. 
She has the right to life. What 
if a girl is abused by a family 
member and becomes preg-
fering from anxiety and vul­
nerability, anti-abortion 
groups attack them, and in­
timidate and murder abor­
tion providers.
Dr. Slepian chose not to 
bow to such intimidation. He 
must be applauded for his 
bravery. Although abortion 
providers in his area have
nant? It would be cruel to force 
her to give birth to such a child. 
We can imagine many such 
scenarios ourselves. In each 
case, the right to choose 
whether to reproduce is vital. 
It would be terrible to snatch 
away this very basic right. In­
stead of supporting women suf-

been chilled by this horren­
dous crime, they have by no 
means been deterred. Ac­
cording to Jane Cerilli, a 
partner in the nearby “Four 
Women” health clinic, there 
have been no cancellations 
and no decrease in the num­
ber of patients calling for
appointments at the clinic af­
ter Slepian’s death. Most 
people in the field have an 
incredible commitment to pro­
viding health care for women 
and this incident is not going 
to change it.
Moreover, this incident 
throws light on the blatant 
hypocrisy of these anti-abor­
tion groups. The supposed ar­
gument is that life is precious 
and must not be destroyed, 
thus abortion is a sin. By kill­
ing someone who believes in 
abortion, these groups have 
contradicted their own beliefs. 
If life is so precious, then how 
can they end a person’s life? 
Another issue is that of the 
unborn child. These groups 
preach that the child should 
not be aborted because it is 
bad to end a life. But what 
if the child, if he or she were to 
be born, believed in abortion? 
Then, these anti-abortion 
groups might prefer such a 
child to not be born, and judg­
ing by their slaughter of Dr. 
Slepian, they might not hesi­
tate to swiftly murder such a 
child — the very child they 
aim to prevent from being 
aborted. The hypocrisy in this 
belief is shocking. Right to 
life is about respecting all hu­
man life.
Dr. Slepian’s bravery has 
only exposed anti-abortion 
movements for their hypocrisy 
and blatant disrespect for the 
law. It has only strengthened 
the abortion movement, not 
deterred it.

Editorial dissent
Chilean despot’s arrest reverberates in U.S.
By introducing segmented reg­
istration times, the HUB has 
taken an important step towards 
achieving OLR’s goal of being a 
quick and easy-to-use registra­
tion system.
The University could spend 
thousands of dollars on OLR to 
make it fast enough that every 
student could register in the same 
first fifteen minutes, but what 
would that get us besides an ex­
pensive system that sits idle for 
50 weeks out of the year? No mat­
ter how OLR is implemented, 
there are going to be students 
who fail to get into the classes 
they want.
It is unfortunate that this new 
setup may encourage people to skip 
classes, but this is no worse than 
the old method which could take 
until after 8:30 am to complete.

The reason lies in recent Chilean

On September4,1970, Salvador Allende 
became the first Marxist head of state 
who won through the process of free, 
democratic election. Allende was the nar­
row winner in a three-way run-off elec­
tion for the presidency of Chile, with 
promises of consolidating Chilean indus­
tries and kicking out the foreign interests 
that owned much of them. At this 
time, U.S. assets in Chile totaled about 
$1.5 billion.
Declassified CIA documents made avail­
able at George Washington University 
show that on September 16 of that year, 
the CIA launched operation FUBELT, a 
covert operation with the express inten­
tion of deposing Allende from office 
.by promoting a coup. This was the 
direct result of a presidential directive, 
authorizing a minimal budget of $10 
million, “more if necessary.” The CIA 
immediately began to pour funds into 
every available source of anti-Allende 
sentiment in Chile, printing and distrib­
uting flyers, posters, and advertise­
ments. In addition, Chilean Christian 
groups, key anti-Allende political ele­

Aid penalties for drug use provoke students
Laws enforce discrimination by class
Open Forum
by Nick Fox-Gieg
I know Halloween’s just past, but if 
you still want to terrify yourself, you 
can go to the High Times Web site 
(www.hightimes.com) and look up a 
chart that lists each state’s penalties 
for marijuana-related crimes. For ex­
ample, possession of less than an ounce 
in Utah could send you to prison for up 
to six months. Boo! And weed is merely 
the humblest of our country’s controlled 
substances, with the least punishment 
attached to it; the passage of a new law 
to beef up those sadly lacking penalties 
would hardly be surprising news. How­
ever, a law that inflicted justice on only 
some of us would be an outrage, wouldn’t 
it? If you think about it, Clinton’s done 
exactly that by endorsing a particularly 
vile amendment to the Higher Educa­
tion Act three weeks back. Essentially, 
the law will prevent students convicted 
of drug crimes — any drug crimes — 
from receiving federal financial aid for 
college for a set number of years.
In some states, like Colorado and 
California, personal possession of mari­
juana is a mere violation, a big traffic 
ticket often unworthy of mention on 
your criminal record. Arkansas’ laws 
are milder than most (that chart gets 
pretty unpleasant if you wander down 
to the Deep South), but if Clinton re­
turned home and took up his old habits, 
he’d face prison on his second arrest. 
Take the reformed hippie’s ideological 
reversal to its logical conclusion, and 
you could argue that, by his own admis­
sion, he doesn’t really deserve to be 
President. If the new law had been in 
effect back when Clinton was dazing 
and confusing himself, it might very 
well have separated our nation’s leader 
from the elite education- that groomed 
him for stardom. I have no idea whether 
or not Clinton received government 
loans for college, but, coming from a 
middle-class background, he very well 
might have. Which brings me to my
main point: Under this new law, only stu­
dents who are eligible for financial aid — 
that is, middle-class and poor students — 
need worry. The act discriminates by class, 
and that fact sickens me. It’s a backhanded 
endorsement of “tolerable” recreational 
drug use for the rich kids. I once met a self- 
appointed radical (from a fairly wealthy 
family) who expounded without a trace 
of irony on the “higher purposes” of chemi­
cal alteration when committed by smart, 
upwardly mobile college students. Expan- 
sion-of-consciousness-and-discovery-of-the- 
inner-self is the name of the game for some 
of us, as opposed to the crude experience 
of the masses, who merely get them­
selves trashed.
This has always been the slant of our 
selectively enforced drug laws, but I’ve 
never seen it so blatantly stated before. It’s 
a good way to catch 
those few poor kids who 
might be planning to 
rise above their station 
and torpedo their fu­
tures over a single in­
discretion back in high 
school. The inevitable 
counterargument is 
that those who break 
the government’s laws 
don’t deserve the 
government’s money, 
but think carefully be­
fore you casually con­
demn the casualties 
under the new law. Go

Punishment must follow illegal acts
Open Forum
by Dave Liber
The recent edict to suspend all Title IV 
Federal Financial Aid for students con­
victed of drug offenses is one that many 
people would have us believe to be a poor 
use of federal power at best. I concede that 
this law is poorly written, poorly struc­
tured, and will almost undoubtedly be de­
clared unconstitutional by the Supreme 
Court. However, even though this new law 
applies different penalties for the same 
crime depending on 
where it was commit­
ted, its intention is not 
invalid. The purpose 
of this law is clear and 
concise — those 
people who decide to 
break the narcotics 
laws of their various 
states will be pun­
ished not only by fine, 
imprisonment, or pro­
bation, but by loss of 
their Title IV Finan­
cial Aid eligibility.
Some might argue 
that this law will be i 
punishing the poor 
and misguided. That 
somewhere out theresitting on a Stafford 
loan. Recall your own Mohd Zekri Ismail/Tartan Art staff exists a student who
high school days, and double-check your 
memories to make sure you didn’t try a' 
little something, sometime.
Putting aside the fact that tougher drug 
laws further strain our prisons and encour­
age across-the-board violations of our civil 
liberties, I wouldn’t be heartbroken over a 
new restriction. However, I’m furious at 
the idea that the doctor’s kid sitting ne&t to 
me at a party might have a measure of 
official sanction to go ahead with his or 
her vice.

will lose his opportunity to attend college 
because of one small, misguided action. 
While there may at some time be someone 
— possibly even a CMU student — who 
cannot afford college because of this new 
law, it is the law that possession of certain 
narcotics is illegal. Applying new penalties 
to already-existing laws is not unheard of 
and certainly not immoral or wrong.
Debating the merits of the drug laws of 
the various states is one thing. However, 
the intent of this new law is not to make 
the possession or use of certain narcotics 
illegal: Rather, it is to add a further 
penalty to what already has been illegal. 
This law is written poorly, I admit that. It 
applies penalties unequally and unfairly.
However, while the exact terms of the law 
are. incorrect, its intent is fair and wise. 
We are not debating the legality of drugs 
with this law; we are simply adding fur­
ther penalty to something already illegal.
Some might also argue that this law 
goes too far, suspending a student’s finan­
cial aid for what might just have been a 
mistake. However, seeing the safeguards 
built into this new law, it is doubtful that 
a student could ever lose his Title IV Fi­
nancial Aid because of a simple “mistake” 
like puffing on one joint. I also would like 
to point out again that certain narcotics 
are illegal and our government has done a 
very good job of making us aware of that 
fact. The fault with this new law does not 
lie in its punishments, but in its wording. 
Instead of relying on state laws, which 
vary greatly for certain offenses, the fed­
eral government should have established 
regulations regarding possession and use 
of narcotics that are universal and exceed 
state laws.
Some would even have us think that this 
new law targets college students unfairly, 
which is absolutely untrue. This law just 
adds further penalties to something al­
ready illegal and does not unfairly target 
college students. The point of this new law 
is to add another definition to the contract 
a student has with the government when 
receiving financial aid. When students 
sign their promissory note with a bank for 
Title IV Aid, they already make a legal 
promise to abide by the law and not go 
around committing misdemeanors. Not 
only must they pay back the money they 
borrow from the government, but they 
also must make satisfactory academic 
progress and keep a clean criminal record.
I freely admit that this new edict isn’t 
the smartest thing Congress has done in a 
while. However, I defend the intent of this 
law, which is to add a further penalty to 
the sale, use, and possession of illegal 
narcotics. A college education should be 
funded by loans, grants, scholarships, par­
ent and student contributions, and cam­
pus jobs, not by selling dope on the street 
corner. If someone has a problem with the 
drug laws, that’s one thing. But that still 
doesn’t justify opposition to this particu­
lar law.

were pushed to help block 
Allende’s ratification.
Documents reveal that on Oc­
tober 16, a secret cable conveyed 
National Security Advisor Henry 
Kissinger’s orders to the CIA’s 
station chief in Santiago, that “it 
is firm and continuing policy that 
Allende be overthrown by a 
coup. The “operating guidance” 
made it clear that these opera­
tions were to be conducted so as 
to hide the “American hand” and 
that the CIA was to ignore 
any orders to the contrary from 
U.S. Ambassador to Chile Ed­
ward Korry.
At this time, the CIA found 
that while certain elements in 
the Chilean military opposed the 
ascension of a socialist to the 
presidency, the military was kept 
in check by its leader, General 
René Schneider. Schneider’s po-
litical views were never clear, 
but he opposed a coup on the 
basis of his respect for Chile’s 
constitutional tradition, and the 
fact that Allende had been con­
stitutionally elected.
The CIA supplied a group of 
Chilean officers led by General 
Camilo Valenzuela with weap­
ons for an operation to kidnap 
Schneider, which was to be 
blamed on Allende supporters, 
thus prompting a military take­
over. Instead, on October 22, 
Schneider was killed by another 
CIA-backed group, led by retired 
General Roberto Viaux. Instead 
of a coup, the military and the 
country rallied behind Allende’s 
ratification by Chile’s Congress 
on October 24.
Nevertheless, with Schneider 
out of the way, the CIA continued 
its operations, backing and fund­
ing the anti-Allende forces in the
Chilean military. On September 
11, 1973, Allende’s presidential 
palace was bombed, Allende him­
self killed, and the country de­
clared under the control of the 
Chilean armed forces led by its 
new senior officers.
The new head of the military 
junta was General Augusto 
Pinochet Ugarte, the same Gen­
eral Pinochet who is being held. 
in England pending extradition 
on charges of genocide and hu­
man rights abuses. In the 25 
years since his ascension to 
power, he has led a brutal re­
gime of crime and repression. 
He has curried U.S. favor by the 
plainest of facades — merely in­
stituting a free market. Yet, he 
has done this at the cost of hu­
man rights. Immediately sus­
pending Chile’s constitution, he 
has steadily done away with 
what was left of Chilean democ­
racy. Those who opposed him, or 
were suspected of doing so, sim­
ply “disappeared.” To date, he 
is responsible for a confirmed 
3,000 deaths, and 50,000 such 
disappearances.
Pinochet is the world’s longest- 
serving dictator, ruler of a coun­
try which makes a mockery of 
freedom. A ruler shrewd enough 
to know that the world’s ruling 
power cares nothing of human 
freedom, but only the economic 
freedom that allows big business 
to continue growing by exploiting 
cheap foreign labor. Just where 
do you think your Coca-Cola 
comes from?
France is currently launching 
its own investigation into 
Pinochet’s actions, and media 
reports in Britain and France 
claim the U.S. is trying to dis­
suade them from pursuing 
Pinochet’s prosecution, lest it
spotlight the fact that Pinochet’s 
regime would never have been 
possible, or even conceived of, 
were it not for U.S. action.
Over 200 years ago, Adam 
Smith, the father of capitalism, 
wrote, “The invisible hand will 
destroy the possibility of a decent 
human existence ... it will de­
stroy community, the environ­
ment and human values gener­
ally.” Pinochet’s brutal regime 
owed its existence to a foreign 
government driven by internal 
business interests, a government 
that gauges its success by 
profit, not standards of justice or 
quality of life. Think of this 
when voting on Tuesday for can­
didates who say they will “sup­
port the economy.”

Are you a good sheep? This is the 
question Dr. Harold Kyriazi is ask­
ing voters all over the Pennsylva­
nia Senate’s 38th District. Are you 
looking for someone to spend your 
money for you, m jcro-regulate busi­
ness for you, create new programs 
for you, make it illegal for you to 
hurt yourself, and build more jails 
for you — so that all you have to do 
is pay and obey?
If not, you should take a look at 
Harold Kyriazi’s campaign. Kyriazi 
is a research neurobiologist at the
University of Pittsburgh and the 
only challenger for the right to 
represent Oakland and the rest of 
the district in the state Senate. 
While Democratic incumbent 
Leonard Bodack proposes to raise 
our sales tax and buy stadiums for 
ball teams, Kyriazi brings many 
reform ideas to this race.
Kyriazi promotes the normal 
set of Libertarian Party goals: 
de-escalating the war on drug 
users, providing parents with a 
choice in where their children are 
educated, ending corporate wel­
fare, and protecting our right to 
self-defense. He also is seeking to 
educate citizens about our right 
to jury nullification.
Early Americans made sure our 
Constitution guaranteed that 
criminal charges would be argued 
before a jury of his peers. Juries 
are the final authority as to 
whether the accused will be pun­
ished. If a jury believes the ac­
cused does not deserve it, then 
there should be no punishment, 
regardless of the law. Today, un­
willing citizens are summoned for 
jury duty, and some are so turned 
off by the hassle that they will not 
register to vote just to avoid being 
summoned for a jury. Kyriazi 
seeks to eliminate compulsoryjury 
duty and remind us that jury duty 
is not a boring obligation, but a 
vital contribution to the mainte-
nance of our liberties.
Probably the most novel of 
Kyriazi’s reform ideas is to change 
the way our government collects 
taxes. He would cut the income 
tax, which discourages employ­
ment and requires complicated 
record keeping. He would cut the 
sales tax, which discourages 
trade. But what really makes 
Kyriazi unique is that he would 
shift the current property tax off 
of buildings and onto the land. 
His platform is based upon the 
belief that each person should 
have equal access rights to 
nature’s bounty and freedom in 
all activities of life so long as no 
harm is directly done to others.
Not only would Kyriazi’s tax plan 
shrink the vast gap between equal­
ity and freedom, but it also would 
help make peace between environ­
ment and economy. We constantly 
hear that we must choose between 
unemployment and ecological de­
struction. Because natural re­
sources have been semi-monopo­
lized, we have no material upon 
which we can exert labor to create 
wealth. So we must beg those who 
own the earth to let us work for 
them. Unfortunately, the only way 
they will benefit from our labor is if 
we cut down another forest for them 
or put more smoke into our air. If we 
only had equal access to the land, 
we would be able to sustain our-

selves without foulingour own nest. 
Environmental destruction is only 
necessary to produce extravagant 
luxury, and to create jobs for the 
distribution of wealth that never 
should have become so concen­
trated in the first place.
Land value taxation is a tax on 
wealth rather than productivity. 
It falls the hardest on those who 
sit idly on land, gaining income 
from rent and speculation, while 
it replaces taxes on those trying to 
accumulate wealth by their own 
labor. If efficiency is defined as 
maximizing production while 
minimizing the use of resources, 
then the key to efficiency is to 
replace taxation of production with 
taxation for the use of resources.
Coupled with taxes on pollution 
and the extraction of non-renew­
able resources, the land tax 
will be the centerpiece of any gov­
ernment which seeks economic ef­
ficiency, full employment, and 
equal opportunity.

Swimmers go undefeated in double-dual meet
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan News Editor
At the beginning of this season, the 
Carnegie Mellon women’s soccer team 
was rebuilding. They had a new coach, 15 
out of their 23 players were first-year 
students or sophomores, and the previous 
season featured only one win at home and 
fewer than one goal per game from the 
offense. However, they also brought a 
renewed sense of purpose.
Last week, as the team finished its sea­
son, it was able to celebrate having im­
proved from last to fifth in the UAA and 
having a more successful season than the 
last by most measures.
Tuesday’s game against Brandéis was a 
successful road trip for the Tartans, who 
were able to easily handle Brandéis in a 3- 
1 win, making up for a loss last year.
CMU gave up an early goal in the first 
five minutes to fall behind, but was quick 
to respond.
‘They were able to sneak one in the first five 
minutes. That was a wake-up call,” said coach 
Heather Kendra. ‘Ten minutes after that we 
scored our three goals within 10 minutes of 
each other.”
“We all played our hardest and 
came together as a team. It was a 
good way to end the season."
— freshman Ashley Wermine
“We just dominated the Brandeis game,” 
said senior co-captain and goalie Lindsay 
Smith. “We were pumped, and we played 
really well. We passed around them and made 
well-placed crosses.”
Two of CMU’s three goals came off crosses. 
Senior Marcy Cook set up the first goal with a 
cross to Kari Pylypyshyn who shot the ball into 
the far post’s side netting to even the score.
Less than four minutes later, sopho­
more Cindy Echevarria scored the go- 
ahead goal for the Tartans when she beat 
the Brandeis goalie one on one. Cook added 
an insurance goal two minutes later off an 
assist from first-year 
student Ashley 
Wermine’s cross.
“We were very 
pleased with the team 
in general, but the of­
fense especially played 
an outstanding game,” 
said Wermine. “It had 
been a while since we 
had scored but we stepped it up and put 
three in the net.”
Three was all that CMU would need at 
Brandeis. CMU only allowed eight shots, 
half of which were not on goal, while they 
took 26 of its own.
The game against Chicago did not go as 
well for Carnegie Mellon. Despite playing
a close game and keeping the score tied
0—0 into the second half, the Tartans gave 
up one goal and could not even the score.
“Chicago was big and strong, and they 
just knocked us around,” said Smith. “I 
was hoping we could combine enough 
passes to slip one in the net.”
With 20 minutes left in the second half, 
Chicago broke the deadlock and took the 
lead for good. Despite the. loss, the team 
felt that it played well.
“[It] was a very good team, and they had 
many more opportunities than we did,” 
said Wermine. “However, we held them 
to one goal, and we even had some very 
close shots late in the game. We all played 
our hardest and came together as a team. 
It was a good way to end the season ... 
even though it was with a loss.”
The team finished its season with an 8- 
9 record overall. Kendra said she was 
pleased with the team’s performance 
throughout the season and felt as though 
the team had met the goals it had set at 
the beginning of the season.Sports this week...

who are undefeated, won against Grove 
City by 83 points with a final score of 157- 
74 and beat Gan on with a tally of149-85.
CMU started the meet with wins in both 
the women’s and men’s 4x100 medley 
relays. The women’s team of senior Jen 
Skuly, junior Erin Rockwell, and fresh­
men Melissa Schmelzer and Erin Andrew 
finished with a winning time of 4:15.96.
“For the girls, I thought we had to do a 
really good job at the beginning with the 
medley relay,” said head coach David 
Belowich. “That was a good relay there 
with [the four women], and they did a fine 
job. That really set the tone. Adding to 
that win was the B relay, where Liz 
Kanabe touched out Grove City. She came 
from behind to do it, and it was really 
neat. The girls swam really, really well.”

Tournament brings prestige to program
TOURNEY, from page 12
to the swim meet last year. “This 
was much smaller than the swim 
meet, and since we knew that we 
could handle swimming, this was 
no problem,” Gerwig said. “Re­
ally, all we had to do was set up 
the gym and bring in the bleach­
ers, which we got from an out­
side vendor.”
With the size of the teams them­
selves and the number of specta­
tors drastically less than at the 
swim meet, the organizers of the 
event didn’t have to worry about 
the lack of space that plagued 
last year’s event. The only minor 
complication faced this year was 
the switch of locales from the 
University Center to Skibo for 
the championship match. Fortu­
nately, the switch went off with­
out a hitch, but, nevertheless, 
plans have been made to prevent 
a similar situation the next time 
CMU hosts the tournament. By 
the next time CMU is scheduled 
to host the tournament, Skibo
will have been completely reno­
vated, expanding the available 
playing space and allowing every 
game to be played there.
While this eliminates the pos­
sibility for confusion in the fu­
ture, there are drawbacks, ac­
cording to Maser. One of the high­
lights of this year’s competition 
was the high visibility offered by 
the University Center facilities. 
With the games visible from the 
second floor dining area as well 
as from the walkway going past 
the gym, many students who 
would not even have known the 
tournament was going on were 
able to see it. “People may not 
have stayed to watch the whole 
match, but they stood by the win­
dows to watch five or 10 min­
utes,” Maser said.
Perhaps as a result of the in­
creased visibility, the overall in­
terest level of the tournament was 
much higher than expected, ac- 
cordingto women’s volleyball coach 
Julie Webb. “We were excited to
have the tournament on our home 
court, and we were very thankful 
for the support from all the par­
ents and students,” she said.
Whether or not the switch to 
Skibo lessens the amount of
spectator interest, future edi­
tions of the tournament will 
have a very solid model to build 
on. “Things went very well,” 
Webb said. “[Maser] did a ter­
rific job.”

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 2 November 1998Coaching leads to impressive win
The Steelers’ Corner
by Rich Torio
Last Monday night may have been the 
turning point of the season. The Steelers 
went into Arrowhead Stadium (one of 
the toughest places to win in the NFL) in 
i nationally televised game and stole 
the game 20-13. The defense, as usual, 
played a stellar game, forcing three turn­
overs, and the running game, as usual, 
forced the ball down the Chiefs’ collec­
tive throat. But what made the game so 
remarkable was not the Steelers’ pat­
ented power football and perfect defense, 
but the new offensive innovations intro­
duced last week. Offensive coordinator 
Ray Sherman may not have opened up 
the passing game last week, but he fi­
nally put his signature on the Pitts­
burgh offense.
The offense lined up in new forma­
tions. and ran new plays, adding a little 
flash to the smashmouth approach. 
“Slash Junior,” the multi-talented rookie 
wide reciever Hines Ward, lined up in 
the slot and in the backfield, and even 
threw a pass once to none other than the 
original Slash, Kordell Stewart. It was 
a thing of beauty, Kordell pitching to 
Ward, Ward wheeling right and Stewart 
swinging left, Ward stopping and pop­
ping a 14-yard strike to the streaking 
Stewart for a first down.
It wasn’t just that isolated play, but 
rather a departure by Ray Sherman 
from relying solely on the isolation play. 
Last Monday, although Jerome Bettis 
got his yards, we didn’t just line up in the 
I-formation every down and pound the 
ball right at the Chiefs. Instead, in addi­
tion to the power running game, the 
Steelers introduced new play-action 
passes, screens, swings, draws, and even 
a new end-around. We even lined up in 
the five wide receiver set once or twice, 
making Steeler fans harken back to the 
good old days of Ron Ehrhardt calling 
the plays.
All in all, five players ran the football 
(including wide receiver Courtney 
Hawkins), two players passed the ball 
(including wide receiver Hines Ward), 
and eight players caught the ball (in­
cluding quarterback Kordell Stewart). 
Sherman utilized all of his offensive 
weapons last week. Our offensive woes 
have not been because of a lack of talent,
but rather a lack of creativity on 
Sherman’s part.
Before last week, the Steelers would 
merely “ride the bus,” but last week, 
other backs gave Bettis a blow. Fred 
McAfee stepped up during the two 
minute drill and sparked a drive that 
yielded three points. Kordell kept the 
ball on a couple of keeper plays, and 
Chris Fuamatu-Ma’afala filled in 
sometimes for Jerome. Blocking back 
Tim Lester uncharacteristically 
caught a couple of balls.
The offense wasn’t exactly exceptional, 
but at least it wasn’t exactly predictable.
I was the first to 
criticize Ray 
Sherman, but 
now Fm the first 
to praise him for 
a job well done. 
Give credit 
where credit is 
due. Although 
the passing 
game hasn’t 
clicked yet, 
maybe the most 
important piece 
of the puzzle is 
in place: the 
coaching. If 
Sherman keeps 
up the ingenuity, the Steelers offense 
will be exciting to watch again. 
Post-game Prognostication: (3-0) 
Steelers 30 - Oilers 10 
The Steelers ride the momentum of 
the big win last week and beat on the 
lowly Oilers. The passing offense 
clicks, and Kordell has his first 
200-yard passing game.

Team faces offensive power next weekend
FOOTBALL, from page 12
“[His rushing performance] says a lot 
for [Monsilovich], but it also says a lot for 
his supporting cast,” said Lackner. ‘The 
linemen and the other fullback and half­
back and the split end h ad to block for him; 
I think it was the case that we were able to 
consistantly dominate 
the line of scrimmage.”
It was a complete 
team effort. From the 
intricate choreography 
of linemen pulling and 
trapping, to the subtle 
sleight-of-hand of the 
quarterback’s fakes, to 
the clockwork-like 
backfield running with 
or without the football, 
the team executed, and 
the team as a whole won 
the game last Saturday.
“It was a great team 
effort,” said Lackner.
“Defense played well 
and the offense was 
very consistent. The 
nice thing about the game was that we 
got to play almost every kid.”
The victory boosted the Tartans’ UAA 
record to 3-1 and kept their title hopes 
alive. Chicago, the only team in the UAA 
to beat the Tartans, stands at 3-0 with 
one game to play next week at Case 
Western Reserve University. If Chicago 
wins, it goes undefeated in the UAA and 
win the title outright. If Case Western is 
victorious, Chicago falls to 3-1, and the
Tartans share a piece of the UAA title. 
If you think that the Tartans will
you’re wrong. If CMU so much as

Brian Smith/Tartan Sports Editor' The Tartans were able to hold Rochester to 26 points.
61 points in a loss to Susquehanna Uni-' 
versity! Although the Tartans hope that; 
Case plays a good game, they have a' 
game of their own to play.
“[Juniata] is an excellent football* 
team,” said Lackner. “[They have] a very', 
explosive, high-powered offense.”
But 61 points in a loss! Yeah, Juniata!,

tans in the winners bracket and 
their hopes for a top three finish 
were high.
“In the format of the tourna­
ment, any team can beat anyone 
on any given day of the week,” said 
Webb. “If one team had a great 
day, they could really go far.”
The team’s next game came 
j Friday afternoon against Johns 
Hopkins University. Again, the
could not recover the lead and 
the game ended 15-7 on a strong 
spike by Szobota.
Hopkins came back in the 
fourth game, however, winning 
15-12 and sending the match 
into a fifth and final game. The 
Tartans did not have any luck in

fered tough luck in the form of

bounces. They fell in the rally

team played well but could not 
overcome their opponents. This 
game was also marked by a large 
crowd, nearly all of it cheering 
for CMU. This led to a very ex­
citing match, and the teams did 
not disappoint.
The Tartans split first two 
games, setting the stage for a 
huge game three. Led by two 
aces by junior Rachelle Abati 
and great defense all around, 
the team jumped out to an 8-5 
lead. The team picked up two 
more points on the strength of 
Putaro’s serving, and the score 
jumped to 10-5. Johns Hopkins
scoring game 15-6. The loss put 
the Tartans in the second scor­
ing bracket, and the stage was 
set for a day two rematch with 
Case Western for fifth place in 
the Tournament.
In addition to the team’s fate, 
a number of Tartans placed high 
in the individual rankings after 
the first day. Szobota placed first 
from her 34 kills against Johns 
Hopkins and ranked highly for 
21 versus CWRU. Putaro’s 62 
and 56 assists versus Johns 
Hopkins and CWRU, respec­
tively, earned her first and sec­
ond place in that category. Fi­
nally, Abati placed in the top 10 
with four aces against Chicago.
The mixed results of day one 
of the championships put even 
more pressure on the Tartans 
to even the score against Case 
on Saturday. The teams came 
out strong, the crowd was loud, 
and every single athlete real­
ized the magnitude of this last 
match of the season.
“Everyone gave 100 percent 100 
percent of the time,” said Webb.
The Tartans won two of the first 
three games and looked forward 
to taking revenge on Case in game 
four. CWRU jumped out to a 9-4 
lead when Webb took a time-out. 
It worked and, aided by outstand­
ing team play, CMU came back 
and was on the verge of knocking 
off the Spartans with a 14-13 lead. 
CWRU got the serve and stole 
three quick points, seemingly be­
fore they knew the Tartans were 
headed into their second rally scor­
ing game in two days.
The fifth game represented 
the culmination of all the pres­
sure, excitement, and hard 
work that the team had experi­
enced though the year. It was 
also the most controversial 
game of the championships.
The score was 3-4 in favor of 
Case when CMU scored a point. 
The scoreboard did not reflect 
this, however, and play went on 
with the score 3-4. Moments 
later, members of the CMU 
crowd alerted Webb to the dis­
crepancy and a discussion en­
sued between the two coaches, 
the official, and scorekeeper. In 
the end, the official ruled that 
the point should not be added 
and the game went on.
“The official was wrong,” said 
Webb. “He was absolutely 
wrong. That is not an excuse for 
the game, though. It was a some­
thing that we couldn’t help, and
we had to play on.”
The Tartans seemed to actu­
ally take it up a notch after the 
ruling. Every point became a 
rise or fall in excitement and 
the team went back and forth in 
dramatic fashion. In the end, 
however, Case Western won 
again, by the closest of margins
— 16-14 — giving the Tartans 
their second straight sixth place 
finish in the Championships.
It was an extremely emotional 
loss, as the team had hoped for 
much more than sixth place.
“Lastyear we were seeded ninth 
goinginto the championships and 
we were able to pull off sixth, 
which was great,” said Webb. 
“Last year we were happy with 
sixth; this year we were hoping 
for much more.”

sity at St. Louis repeated as UAA 
Champion and Emory took sec­
ond. Again, there were personal

Young volleyball squad finds 
bitter end to exceptional year
Events go off without hitch in 
University Center, Skibo Gym
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Editor
Anticipation and tension 
were at a feverish level last 
week as the members of the 
Carnegie Mellon volleyball 
team prepared to host the 1998 
University Athletic Association 
Championships. They had pre­
pared all year for this, the cham­
pionships were their chance to 
prove to the rest of the UAA 
how much they had improved. 
It was by far the pinnacle of the 
season, made especially impor­
tant because of the home crowd 
cheering them on. What’s more, 
they faced their arch-rival Case 
Western Reserve University 
(CWRU) in the first match — a 
meeting that would undoubt­
edly be one of the premiere 
matchups of the tournament.-
All this culminated in enor­
mous pressure that the team 
put on itself — pressure that 
would be evident in the Tar­
tans throughout the tourna­
ment and would make the bit­
ter end of the season so tough 
to take.
“Our confidence was high 
[in the week before the cham­
pionships],” said coach Julie 
Webb. “We were all very ner­
vous going in.”
The Tartans came out firing 
against Case last Friday. The 
opening game was highlighted 
by a number of long volleys, 
with players diving all over the 
place — it was clear that both 
teams were going to give this 
game everything they had. De­
spite great efforts by a number 
of Tartan women, CWRU stole 
the first game 15-12.
CMU came back in the sec­
ond game, though, highlighted
by great defense by junior Ashley 
Kinsey, assisted by junior captain 
Sarah Putaro, and a number of big 
blocks and kills by junior Stephanie 
Szobota and freshman Sara 
Lechleitner. The Tartans took the 
game 15-12.
The pressure seemed to get to the 
Tartans in the next two games. 
“Because of the pressure that we 
put on ourselves we started to play 
scared,” said Webb. Case jumped 
out to a 9-0 led in game three, and 
the Tartans were not able to re­
cover. Miscommunication, miss- 
hits, and a few bad 
bounces led to a 15-4 
Tartan loss. The fourth 
game was much the 
same, as the team was 
not able to keep up with 
the CWRU attack and 
lost 15-7, losing the first 
match of the Champion­
ship 3—1.
“As soon as [the 
CWRU match] was over,
I said ‘Forget it. It’s done 
and over with. Just go 
out there and have fun 
and play,’” said Webb.
The team responded.
In the next match, the 
Tartans played the Uni­
versity of Chicago. They 
split the first two games, 
leading to a pivotal game 
three. In this game, the 
Tartans were able to es­
tablish a winning streak 
and gain some confi­
dence. They pulled out a 
close victory, 15-12, and 
went on to dominate 
Chicago in the deciding 
fourth game 15-4, win­
ning their first match of 
the Championships..

department head of Athletics and 
Physical Education Joan Maser, 
the event’s primary coordinator.
Planning for the event be­
gan almost immediately follow­
ing the UAA announcement 
that CMU would be the host for 
the 1998 tournament, begin­
ning the collaborative effort of 
the Athletic Department, Uni­
versity Center staff, food court 
vendors, and countless others 
who had to work together to 
make the tournament the out­
standing success it was.
CMU’s commitment to the 
event was guaranteed last fall, 
when the Athletic Department 
reserved the use of the Univer­
sity Center gym for the early 
rounds of the tournament. From 
there, work on the project qui­
eted down until the summer, 
when planning of the actual 
workings of the tournament re­
ally picked up steam, according 
to Maser. Distribution of infor­
mation about lodging, local res­
taurants, and the like to the 
participating schools, organiza­
tion of the season-ending ban­
quet for the teams, the search 
for students to assist as score- 
keepers, ballboys, and line 
judges, and all the other minute 
details that participants take 
for granted had to be carefully 
planned by Maser and her staff.
And all that was just the Ath­
letic Department’s contribu­
tion. Equally important was the 
setup of the University Center 
itself, spearheaded by coordi­
nator of University Center fa­
cilities Marcia Gerwig. Though 
just as, crucial to the 
tournament’s success, this as­
pect of the setup was easier by 
far, especially when compared

Excitement, anxiety peak at UAA Championships
By JOSH McCONNELL
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
On a chilly, gray October evening, 
the CMU men’s soccer team took the 
field at Gesling Stadium for its last 
home game of the season against Wash­
ington and Jefferson University. Its 
opponent was not from the same con­
ference; they were not even a tradi­
tional rival. The Tartans were playing 
for some other motivation.
After two disappointing losses to start 
the season, the Tartans have rolled off an 
impressive record of 12-2-1. If it weren’t 
for those two early losses, the squad al­
ready would have earned an NCAA play­
off berth. As it 
stands now though, 
it is struggling to 
get the attention 
of the NCAA 
committee. A win 
was imperative.
Tartan domina­
tion began early.
The first score 
came off of a comer 
kick, to junior 
sweeper Dave 
Huryk’s head. Al­
though he is the de­
fensive anchor of 
the team, Huryk 
has been an impor­
tant offensive 
weapon all three of 
his seasons as a 
Tartan starter, es­
pecially on corner kicks. The second and 
third goals blasted off junior John 
Petrillo’s boot, one coming in each half.
The final goal was tallied by Andy 
Chun off a Harry Ulrich free kick. The 
point awarded for the assist gave Ulrich 
his 100th career point as a Tartan, a 
milestone for any attacking player. 
Ulrich leads the team and UAA this 
season in total points.
For Ulrich and fellow senior Dan 
Brody, this game had an especially deep
meaning. It was their last home game 
to cap off two impressive careers as 
four-year starters. With any luck,the 
two, along with their teammates will 
be able to extend their careers with 
either an NCAA or ECAC postseason 
tournament appearance. A win at con­
ference opponent Chicago on Satur­
day will certainly help the Tartans in 
their quest for a postseason.
If the season does come to a close 
this Saturday, at least the Tartans 
will be able to go out with an impres­
sive home win in front of a dedicated 
CMU crowd. Junior keeper Ben 
Kartzman said, “We love ’em. ‘G’s 
army’ [a reference to head coach Nick
Brian Smith/Tartan Sports Editor Senior Harry Ulrich, who leads the UAA In points this season, leaps over a Washington and Jefferson opponent’s slidetackle.
Gaudioso], as they’re called, are great. 
It’s super for us to see our peers come 
out and support us and show some 
confidence in us and some pride in 
our school.”
The impressive 4-1 victory over 
Washingtong & Jefferson gave the 
loyal crowd something to cheer about. 
A Tartan win at Chicago would give 
“G’s army” and the Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team at least one more 
game this year.
The swarming University of Rochester 
Yellowjackets were mere pests for Carnegie 
Mellon on Halloween, as the Tartans squashed 
them 60-26. It was truly a nightmare on Forbes 
Avenue for the visiting insects. Rochester quar­
terback Jeff Piscitelli was running for his life all 
game long while junior running back Mike 
Monsilovich was running wild, racking up nearly 
150 yards in the first half alone as CMU went up 
46-14 at the half.
Mohsilovich’s obscene offensive numbers won 
him the game ball... right? Not so, according to 
head coach Rich Lackner. “Nobody got the game 
ball,” said Lackner. “We don’t have enough game 
balls to go around.” Very true. If we had to list 
everybody who scored on Saturday, stats would 
take up the entire article. But Monsilovich rushed 
for almost 150 yards in one half. Surely that 
warrents some outward sign of praise ... right? Anthony D’Auria/Tartan Photo Staff

By ERIN LUCAS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last week’s game pitting the CMU 
hockey club versus Slippery Rock Uni­
versity proved to be an interesting one. 
Penalties collectively added up to 34 
minutes — this translates to two entire 
periods of power-play opportunities.
The Tartans started off strong in the 
first period with a quick goal at 1:27 by 
graduate student Adam Duncan, as­
sisted by junior Dan Grosso. This goal 
was followed by angry and sloppy play 
by Slippery Rock, resulting in a rapid 
succession of five minor penalties. Al­
though Carnegie Mellon was unable to 
capitalize on any of these power-play 
opportunities, graduate student Roger 
Maddalena managed to put the puck in 
the net at 8:24 with help from fifth-year 
senior Scott Fitzgerald and freshman 
Eliot Minichello. After one period of 
play, the Tartans were up 2-0 and sus­
tained only two penalties: a bench mi­
nor for too many men on the ice and a 
high sticking penalty.
The second period was an exciting 
one. CMU made three out of the four 
goals scored this period despite the fact 
that second period penalties belonged 
exclusively to the Tartans. Two goals 
were scored back to back, the first of 
which belonged to Steve Woods with 
assists from Fitzgerald and Maddalena 
at 4:11. Immediately after at 4:40, 
Maddalena scored with an assist from 
senior Alex Chin, his second goal of the 
evening. The game was quiet until 10:46 
when junior PJ Gryzwacz worked his 
way through traffic in front of the net 
and made an unassisted goal.
Slippery Rock finally answered at 
15:35 with a strong shot which somehow 
managed to make its way behind 
goaltender junior Gil Min. The second 
period ended with a bang—three minor 
penalties were given to Carnegie Mellon 
for hooking, roughing, and unsports­
manlike conduct.
Then came the third period, which 
was definitely the most interesting from 
a spectator’s standpoint. It began with 
two minor CMU penalties. Woods got
caught with holding, while Duncan got 
to sit for roughing.
Fortunately, Slippery Rock did not 
cash in on these powerplay opportuni­
ties. Instead, they received two minor 
penalties themselves for hooking and 
interference. Finally, despite the fact 
that this was a penalty-ridden game, the 
first power-play goal was scored by Tar­
tan captain fifth-year senior Paul 
Voulgaris at 11:12.
Things got a little strange a short 
while later at 11:46 when Duncan was 
cross-checked in the face behind the 
play. Needless to say, he was not happy; 
and chose to share his anger with the 
referees. When the officials, were not 
receptive to his pleas, he decided to actu­
ally show how angry he really was.
This may not have been the best idea 
because it resulted in five penalties for 
Duncan. This long.combination included 
a double minor for hooking and miscon­
duct, a 10-minute major for misconduct, 
a game misconduct, and a gross miscon­
duct. After that ordeal was over, fresh-

OUT CLASSED
EACH SEMESTER, 5000 undergraduates 
must fight their way into 
a limited number of 
spaces in the courses 
and programs of 
their choice. Why 
has it become a 
necessity to wake 
up at 6 am to get

Students maneuver around
barriers to fine arts minors
Lack of classroom space 
leads to schedule angst
By WENDY BUFFETT
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Many Carnegie Mellon students have attempt­
ed to minor in areas of the College of Fine Arts for 
various reasons. They may have enjoyed art, 
music, or acting in high school and wished to con­
tinue taking classes in those areas. Others may 
have wanted to go into a field that combines an 
area of fine arts with their major. Whatever'their 
motivations may have been, some students have 
found that deciding to minor in CFA invited more 
problems than they expected.
The first problem that students encounter after 
choosing to minor in CFA is getting approval, 
especially in the School of Design. Among the 
minors in CFA, design is the most popular choice, 
according to Melissa Cicozi, assistant head of the 
School of Design. In fact, the design minor 
became so popular that the classes were filling 
very early semester after semester. Problems 
also appeared when students took only two class­
es and never completed the program, said Cicozi.
A few years ago, the School of Design decided to 
try solving this problem by requring minors to 
have portfolios. A portfolio shows the quality of 
the student as well as proving a student’s moti­
vation and dedication to the program.
The School of Art has far fewer requests for 
minors, so it can accommodate them more easily. 
A minor in art requires no portfolio review, as the 
school has found that most minors are very dedi­
cated to the program, according to Mary Schmidt, 
associate department head of the School of Art. 
“There has never been an issue about this in art,” 
she said. “The minors add such interest to the 
classroom. I don’t think they ever earn Ds.”
In fact, in most of the CFA departments, it is 
easier to obtain a minor. The School of Drama 
requires that students take one class on a trial 
basis. If they do well, they will be allowed to minor. 
This gives students a non-binding way to try out 
classes and see if it is what they want to do.
Once the student has managed to acquire a 
minor in CFA, the next problem they encounter is 
scheduling. Classes conflict, fill up quickly, or are 
too time-consuming for people with a heavy 
Workload. “Drama studios and Acting I get real­
ty competitive, even among non-majors,” said
Steven Selikoff, a junior industrial management 
major with a minor in drama. “They have Acting 
for Non-Majors [which] last year was made up 
entirely of senior non-drama majors. The class 
was completely full the first day of registration.” 
There are similar problems in almost all of the 
departments. Joel Young, a sophomore computer 
science major with a minor in art, says that reg­
istering for the classes you need is the hardest 
part of having a minor. “Getting into the classes 
was kind of a pain,” he said. “All that I kept hear­
ing after I signed up was that I had to wait, I had 
to wait, and that they had to sign up all the 
majors and there might not be a space and that I 
was on a wait list... but I finally got in.”
Some of the departments are trying to fix these 
problems. Judith Kampert, assistant department 
head of the School of Architecture, admits that in 
the past, classes for minors were difficult to get 
into. “Architecture for Non-Majors is what most 
people who want to minor take,” she said. “It 
used to be really hard to get into, but we recent­
ly increased it to two sections. They get about 40

ple who aren’t accommodated.”
Cicozi said that Communication Design 
Fundamentals grew to three sections this fall and 
two this spring. “And people still complain that 
we’re not offering enough,” she said. “We’re doing 
what we can; the problem is, we’re not being given 
enough funds to teach these classes, so we just 
don’t have the dollars to hire additional teachers.” 
Furthermore, the Schools of Art and Design

specific problems in resource allocation. 
Statistics professor and Associate Dean of 
H&SS Joel Greenhouse explains that the lack 
of physical space in which to teach these class­
es is the major factor in this problem.
“As the number of students attending CMU 
has increased, so has the number of classes,” 
said Greenhouse. “[But] where are the class­
rooms? In the past five years, when the 
University has built new buildings, such as 
the University Center, Roberts Hall, and now 
the Purnell Center, they haven’t really built 
new classrooms.”
According to Planning Services’ “Carnegie 
Mellon Facts,” between 1993 and 1997 there 
has been a 7.8 percent increase in the number 
of units taught. But over that same period, the 
total net assignable space for classrooms and 
services rose by about one-tenth of a percent.
The number of smaller classes being offered 
in traditional courses as well as new academic 
programs, is another factor that contributes to 
the problem of classroom availability.
“Sometimes classes do not have enough spaces 
because faculty members choose to limit class 
size when they believe there is an optimal size 
for teaching the subject,” said Barbara Lazarus, 
associate provost for Academic Projects.
“H&SS last year started offering a mandator 
ry freshman seminar,” said Greenhouse. “It’s 
another educational initiative which we believe 
is a positive thing for enhancing the student 
learning experience. But it requires more class­
rooms, and thus an additional demand on class­
room space.”
Greenhouse, among others in the college, 
feels that the new wing being added to Baker 
Hall should be devoted to classrooms, not more 
departmental research or offices. But some 
other administrators looking into the issue feel 
that building more classrooms is not necessar­
ily the solution.
“In some ways, we found that if we can relax 
a little more where people can teach, [the 
enrollment department] can respond to one- 
third of our space problems,” said Bill Elliott, 
vice president for Enrollment Services. “So I

From the day the course schedules are dis­
tributed, CMU students already have drafts of 
their schedules for the next semester. The 
draft is never perfect, since there is probably 
going to be a time conflict somewhere, but this 
problem is often worked around smoothly. But 
when registration day arrives, these drafts 
undergo a major overhaul as several highly 
desired classes fill quickly and the waitlist 
goes up to double digits. When their finished 
schedule looks completely different from their 
preconceived draft, many students begin to 
wonder, “What happened?”
Administrators have also asked this question 
and have come up with several theories 
explaining why many students are shut out of 
classes. These theories may all have a part in 
the registration problem, but none of them 
have easy fixes.
John Papinchak, vice provost of Enrollment 
Services, pointed out the basic reason why 
there are so many classes filled early: There 
are simply not enough resources.
“You only have so many faculty members, 
and they can only teach so many classes. So 
then it becomes a matter of resources,” said 
Papinchak. “If everything were infinite, then 
this wouldn’t be a problem.”
Other administrators have pinpointed more

Not long ago, the Royal Swedish 
Academy of Sciences announced that 
John Pople, formerly a professor of 
chemistry at CMU, would be a recipi­
ent of a Nobel Prize for his work in 
quantum chemistry. In 1986, Pople 
moved on to a professorship at 
Northwestern University and formally 
retired from CMU five years later; he 
currently teaches at the University of 
California at Santa Barbara but found 
the time to come back to CMU to cele­
brate his accomplishment with friends 
and colleagues here. Although he was 
only in Pittsburgh for a short time last 
week, The Tartan managed to catch up 
with him to talk about his accomplish­
ments in the field of chemistry, as well 
as his personal interests beyond the 
world of atoms, molecules, and quan­
tum dynamics.
The Tartan: When you first found out 
you won the Nobel Prize, what was 
your immediate reaction?
John Pople: I was somewhat over­
whelmed. I thought that much of the 
credit should go to the people who 
worked with me in the field because 
much of what I worked on was based on 
other people’s work, so really, it was

I’m in.
TT: How did you 
first become interested 
in chemistry?
JP: I was a mathe­
matician as a student; 
after I completed my 
undergraduate work, I 
looked for a field where 
mathematics would be 
useful. Around 1948, 
chemistry was such a 
field. Theory and 
mathematics have 
made a big impact on 
chemistry in the past 
few years.
TT: What have you 
missed most about 
CMU since you left?
JP: My wife and I 
were always fond of the 
city of Pittsburgh as a 
place to live. We like 
the countryside in 
western Pennsylvania 
as well — there are not 
as many hills in the 
Chicago area.
We enjoyed living in Pittsburgh for 
many years — we have many friends 
and colleagues here, and we miss the 
interaction with them.
r\o naKaisu/ larian rnoio oiarr Pople retired from the Chemistry Department in 1991.
TT: How does CMU now compare to 
how it was when you left it?
JP: The Mellon Institute has not 
changed a great deal. I haven't seen 
much of the rest of campus, but last
year, I did visit the new [University] 
Center. It seems like there’s a lot more 
activity than when I was here; the 
school has really blossomed in the past 
30 years.
TT: What sort of things do you like to 
do outside of your work?
JP: My wife and I travel a great deal. 
We visit Europe every summer, and 
we’ve been to Australia nine times. We 
like to travel. Often, it’s in connection 
with my work, but we like to move 
around the world.
TT: Where in Europe have you been?
JP: I come from England, and so I 
return to England frequently. I have a 
son who lives in Ireland.
I’ve also attended many science con­
ferences in various countries in Europe.
TT: How about Australia? What's it 
like down there?
JP: It’s a very empty country. There 
are large stretches of undeveloped 
land, but there are also active and 
interesting places.
It’s interesting because it’s a develop­
ing place. Western Australia is the size 
of Europe, but it only contains one mil­
lion people. There are elements of pros­
perity — the towns are often quite 
wealthy — and the people are interest­
ing. We have many friends in 
Australia, and I’ve even had a couple of 
students who came from there.

By MARSHALL WARFIELD
Dossier Literary Editor
Last Wednesday night, students 
entered the McKenna-Peter-Wright 
room in the University Center expect­
ing the humor, quirkiness, and intro­
spection for which award-winning poet 
Jack Myers is known. They were pleas­
antly surprised. Immediately after 
introducing himself, Myers explained 
that the poems he would read were 
part of a new direction for him. It was 
deeper, more spiritual work that 
strived for more universal themes.
“He focused a lot on Eastern spiritu­
ality rather than his humorous work, 
which was how my poetry class knew 
his work,” said Amy Cyphert, a sopho­
more English major.
Myers was born in Massachusetts in 
1941 and has been writing since he was 
12. He received his BA from the 
University of Massachusetts and his 
MFA from the Iowa Writers Workshop. 
For a brief period of time, he was Anne 
Sexton’s mailman, and she encouraged 
him to keep writing and become a poet.
The introductions he gave for his 
poems were short. The poems often 
spoke for themselves, requiring no
introductions at all. Setting the tone 
for the evening was his first poem, “Not 
My Cup of Tea.” The poem played with 
the notions of pleasure and how 
attached to physical objects people 
sometimes get. His skili at craft and 
wit were still there, but it was obvious 
to readers of his older work that Myers
The following day, Myers spoke to 
Michael Simms’ and Jim Daniels’ poet­
ry classes. He gave more background 
about the new directions in his work 
and in his life.
“Some experiences [I had while grow­
ing up, and both in and out of college] 
opened [me] up to new planes of con-
“l’m finding out much more about myself, 
and who better than that to learn about? 
You’re stuck with yourself for a lifetime. Why 
not find out as much as you can?”
Jack Myers
had a new focus. He moved o.n to more 
Eastern poems by presenting several 
parable poems about Buddha’s previ­
ous incarnations. He also read a few 
poems about the Tarot.
“His poems were honest, and his 
work with the Tarot was very syn- 
chronicitous,” said Elizabeth Paddock, 
a senior BHA major. “My dad is about 
the same age as he is and also interest­
ed in Tarot. I found I could connect to 
his Tarot poems.”
sciousness, but now I’m realizing how 
often some of those experiences weren’t 
healthy ones,” said Myers. “In the 
Tarot and in the I Ching, I’m finding 
much healthier ways to obtain those 
same planes even deeper. I’m finding 
out much more about myself, and who 
better than that to learn about? You’re 
stuck with yourself for a lifetime. Why 
not find out as much as you can?” 
Myers’ earlier work handled heavy 
themes like divorce and separation. His
current poems manage to handle tough 
emotional situations with the wisdom 
of some Eastern philosphies. “Now, I’ll 
look at an emotional situation and try 
to find the universal of that situation 
said Myers.
Myers currently teaches at the 
Southern Methodist University ini 
Dallas. He also teaches in the Vermont 
College MFA program, which he said he 
likes better than Iowa’s. Vermont’s pro­
gram is a correspondence course that; 
Myers feels offers a teacher more inter­
action with students than the group- 
based instruction of Iowa’s workshops.
“Jack would send me several typed 
pages about my poems,” said Carol 
Hamilton, an English professor who; 
received her MFA in creative writing 
from Vermont College under Myers.
The Eastern philosophies in Myers 
work are now also in his life. “I have 
the life I always wanted. If I didnt 
write anymore, it would be all right, 
he said. “I no longer need to be an hon­
ored poet; I just want to be happy.”
“Things have become more precious, 
and now I’ve come to the point where 
I’m enjoying myself,” he said. “Some 
people are given that; I’ve had to earQ 
it. I guess it was my Karma.”

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 2 November 1998L3Government regulation drives writer to paranoia
The Geek Beat
by Ellen Beldner
Repeat after me: I will be paranoid. I 
will be suspicious. I will not trust the 
government.
Back in late 1993 and early 1994, the 
U.S. government — in the form of its 
National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) and the FBI — 
decided that widely spreading comput­
ing power plus modems equalled trou­
ble for its law enforcement abilities. So, 
amidst nightmarish visions of 
www.buycrackhere.com and Usenet 
bboards for bombmaking tips, the gov­
ernment decided to push for a key- 
escrow national encryption scheme. 
This, coupled with export restrictions 
on cryptography that actually works 
and is, for all practical purposes, 
uncrackable, was supposed to enable 
the government to keep tabs on 
Internet communication and to mini­
mize the amount of crime that is facili­
tated by instantaneous and secure com­
munications.
Back in 1994, the Net was mostly 
populated by geeks. Although it wasn’t 
yet a desirable name to have applied to 
you, it meant pretty much the same 
thing as it does now: You lilted comput­
ers, technology, and silicon. AOL hadn’t 
yet taken off, meaning that there were 
far fewer of the clueless spreading their 
mind-numbing “How R U?” drivel 
across Usenet and IRC; the majority of 
people on the Net were aware of the 
technological and political ramifications 
of the proposed key-escrow system.
In a nutshell, a key-escrow system 
means that you can encrypt your data 
with the digital equivalent of a pad­
lock and only the person who owns the 
key to the padlock can unlock — i.e., 
decode — the data. Except that the 
government makes the key owner 
duplicate the key at the local hard­
ware store and then stores the key in 
a vault somewhere, to allegedly be 
opened by a Fourth Amendment- 
approved warrant.
Although the 1994 proposal has since 
been scrapped and modified, the gov­
ernment’s basic wish remains the 
same: It doesn’t want you to be able to 
export strong cryptography (if you’ve 
ever downloaded Netscape or Internet 
Explorer, you surely remember the 
page where you have to swear that 
you’re a U.S. citizen before you choose 
the browser with the strongest security 
features) unless they have a means of 
cracking it. And if we could peek inside 
Louis Freeh’s mind, we’d probably find 
a few thoughts advocating key escrow 
for even domestic encryption.
Now, there are many law-abiding citi­
zens who, hearing the government’s 
plan, sit back and say, “Well, I don’t have
anything to hide, so why not let the gov­
ernment hold a copy of my encryption 
key?” Two words: Big Brother. If you’ve 
read either George OrwelT-s 1984 or 
Michel Foucault’s Discipline and 
Punish, you’ve probably got a semi- 
healthy paranoia about the evil effects 
of constant surveillance. Surveillance 
leads to compliance and conformity: If 
you think someone is watching you, you 
probably won’t steal a car, murder some­
one, or pick your nose.
The National Security Agency (NSA) 
has had the capability to observe and 
record all forms of communication for 
years under its Echelon project; now, 
when the American public finally has a 
means to hide its communications, the 
government gets its undies in a bunch 
and tries to maintain its upper hand. 
But its methodology is skewed. The 
government’s key-escrow system will 
only truly allow government surveil­
lance if everyone uses it. But do you 
think your friendly neighborhood crack 
dealer will use an encryption scheme 
that the government can access if he
can get better encryption? Not a 
chance. For everyone to abide by the 
government standard, all other forms 
of encryption will have to be outlawed.
Preventing the use of strong encryp­
tion is like outlawing kitchen knives. 
Yes, they can be used to do dangerous- 
things — but they also have many valid 
uses. The government has no business 
outlawing every item that could possi­
bly be used to facilitate criminal activi­
ty. Unless an item is used exclusively to 
break the law (like, say, crack), govern­
ment officials should stick to what they 
do best: criminalizing behaviors, flip­
ping out about glue-sniffing teenagers, 
and kissing babies. In the meantime, 
go out and download a copy of Pretty 
Good Privacy at www.pgp.com and 
start sending out encrypted messages 
with “Screw the FBI!” in your sig.

writing major who uses a 128-bit PGP 
encryption key to prevent the FBI from 
finding out about her crack-selling 
activities.Student preferences limit class scheduling options
SHORTAGE, from page L3
don’t think we’re going to see 
more classrooms in the short- 
run.... We’ll first have to relax 
some of the constraints about 
where and when the faculty 
want to teach.”
This task is not an easy one,, 
however, due to the current 
process of setting up the 
schedule of classes each 
semester. The scheduling for 
each classroom is done by 
either the enrollment regis­
trar or by the departments 
themselves. Currently, the 
registrar is able to assign 
classes to over one-half of the 
classrooms on campus. The 
remaining classrooms have 
classes assigned to them by 
their respective departments. 
For the most part, the depart­
ments schedule those classes 
on their own and then notify 
the registrar of their offerings 
for the semester.
“If [the registrar] could have 
access.to some of those classes, 
then we can help ourselves,” 
said Elliott. “Right now, there 
is a large number of classes 
between 10 am and 2 pm. 
Moving more classes [out of 
this range] would help solve 
the problem. But nobody wants 
to go to class before 10 am and 
after 2 pm ... and the faculty 
don’t want to teach when the 
students won’t go. So does it 
make sense to build more class­
rooms that are only going to be 
used for 'four hours?”
Like the expensive price tag 
that comes with the addition of 
new classrooms, changing the 
preferences of faculty and stu­
dents would be just as costly, if 
not impossible, since there is 
going to be some kind of incon­
venience for all parties 
involved. Students may find 
themselves going to more 
8:30 am classes, and professors 
may have a longer walk to 
the classrooms where they 
have to teach.
While the administration 
and departments are looking 
into these factors to figure out
a long-term solution, students 
still face the possibility of not 
being able to get into all the 
courses they intend to take 
next semester. Introduction to 
Business Management is an 
example of a class where manjr 
students may find themselves 
shut out when trying to regis­
ter. Last spring, sophomores 
trying to register for this class 
on only the third day of OLR 
found themselves far down on 
the waitlist, which had already

grown as big as the class size 
itself. Nevertheless, many- offi­
cials involved with the regis­
tration process are still confi­
dent that students will get into 
the courses they need.
“We still commit that all stu­
dents will get access to ail the 
courses in their primary major 
in the number of years 
required,” said Robert Kail, 
associate dean of undergradu­
ate studies in CIT. “I think that 
we can pretty much assure that 
we can get the classes that 
students need whenever they 
need them, so that they can get 
the classes required to gradu­
ate. And I also think that we’ll 
be able to make available the 
courses that students want 
but don’t need.... Do we meet 
this demand for everyone? No. 
But if you don’t get into a 
course this semester, try again 
next fall.”
In the case of the business 
management course, under­
graduates often want to take it 
to pursue a minor in business 
administration. Those stu­
dents often feel discouraged, 
thinking they will not get into 
the class because all the stu-
Management] to achieve this,” 
said Kirkpatrick.
When students find them­
selves on the waitlist for cours­
es that they think are impor­
tant to take, it is best for them 
to talk with their advisors or 
with the faculty members 
teaching the courses. Special 
arrangements can be made to 
accommodate certain students 
regardless of how low they are 
on the waitlist.
“The way the waitlist gets 
cleared is not by order of the 
waitlist. Just because you’re 
number one on the list doesn’t 
mean you’ll be the first to get 
into the class,” said 
Greenhouse.
But it still seems that the 
scheduling problems at CMU 
are not going to get significant­
ly better for several years. 
Faculty and administration 
are looking into the problem, 
however. In addition, the new 
OLR system will be able to pro­
vide more in-depth statistics 
about many aspects of the reg­
istration process. In any case,

MINORS, from page LI
have decided not to offer classes 
for non-majors. “We did away 
with our courses just for minors 
because they were watered 
down as compared to ones for 
the majors,” said Cicozi.
Schmidt explained the reason­
ing behind the decision. “It’s bet­
ter for a college-level student to 
take a course that’s for a regular 
major than one for non-majors,” 
she said. “Courses for non­
majors are usually geared 
towards those who are not as 
serious about their work. In the 
Art Department, minors are 
usually very serious about it. 
Every once in a while, we get a 
request for non-majors, but [stu­
dents] mostly want to take 
classes with the majors.”
Many students feel that being 
teamed with majors is a good 
learning experience. “For the 
first couple of classes, it was a 
bit intimidating, but I’m used to 
being the odd one out, so it was 
kinda fun,” said Young. “I played 
it up a bit. Half of my projects 
have had to do with computers 
or computer chips or some weird 
stuff like that.”
Selikoff had a similar experi­
ence. “It’s kind of awkward 
when you’re in a classroom with 
almost all drama students,” he 
said. “Last year, when I took 
Fundamentals of Drama with 
all of the freshman drama stu­
dents, the faculty made a lot of 
announcements for them that 
don’t really pertain to minors. I 
understand that they have to do 
that, but it was still kind of
strange. I definitely like taking 
classes with majors because a 
lot of the staff and students are 
really good at what they do and 
you can learn a lot from the peo­
ple around you.”
Sometimes, scheduling is a lit­
tle easier. Amy Poettinger, a 
fifth-year senior architecture 
major with a minor in drama, 
found that the departments 
were flexible in allowing her to 
take the courses she needed. “It 
was slightly difficult because 
several of the required classes 
conflict with architecture studio, 
but overall, the School of Drama 
was lenient in letting me substi­
tute classes because I am so 
committed to the program.”
As for acquiring experience 
and portfolios needed to get a 
minor, there are ways that stu­
dents can develop their skills. 
Those wanting drama experi­
ence can join private groups not 
affiliated with the School of 
Drama. Both Selikoff and 
Poettinger are members of 
Scotch ’n’ Soda.
“Through S’N’S you can be an 
assistant for a designer, try out 
for a show, be a stage manager, 
assistant direct, do improv, write 
shows, whatever you want,” said 
Poettinger. “There are also some 
members that are doing a drama 
minor, like myself, or who have 
strong connections to the School 
of Drama.”
The School of Design offers an 
alternative for students without 
portfolios. Students who are 
interested in minoring may go to 
the design office and ask about
the design project. The project 
consists of a series of exercises 
which allow the faculty to judge 
the applicant’s drawing and 
observation skills. There are 
also tutors for music, private art 
instruction studios in the city, 
and many students who would 
be willing to help.
Despite all the problems stu­
dents encounter while getting a 
Fine Arts minor, their hard 
work is often justified. Students 
enhance their career by minor­
ing in areas related to their 
future employment. “I want to 
go into theater management, so 
it helps to take classes in the­
ater production,” said Selikoff. 
“The hands-on experience will 
really help me know what’s 
going on behind the scenes.” 
Poettinger has a similar moti­
vation. “One of the fields I would 
like to pursue is the design and 
renovation of theaters, so I have 
a strong understanding of what 
it takes to put a production 
together, to direct, design, man­
age, build, light ... and that

I’m sure you’ve heard of the so-called “celestial registry” idea — the one 
where you send people money and they purport to name a star for you 
in some big global database. My question is, how come everyone does the 
same silly thing and names the stars after themselves? If it were me, I 
would name mine something like the “Big, Bad Star,” the “Celestial Body 
Formerly Known As Star,” or the “Star of Whoop-Ass”. People, if you’re 
going to be naming a gigantic nuclear furnace, try and go for something a 
little more daring than the “Dorfman Star” or the “Jones Star.”

INMOOTFO RAWToA FulTFOd TlMyA
By KATIE KOWALL
Tartan Staffwriter
Historically, comic books range from slingshot-wield­
ing superheroes to today’s technologically saturated, 
overgrown beasts. No matter what the time period 
comic books have managed to survive, if not thrive, 
through the years. Now, in the ’90s, the market has 
expanded to include more independent companies with 
a wider variety of comic book themes and authors.
According to Wayne Wise, assistant manager of The 
Phantom of the Attic, a comicbook store located on Craig 
Street, three companies have made up the bulk of the 
industry for the last 30 years: DC, which includes, 
among others, Superman, Wonder Woman, and The 
Fantastic Four; Marvel, the creators of Spiderman, The 
Avengers, and X-Men; and Image, a newer publisher, 
which has created, most notably, the comic Spawn.
“DC characters are the ones that people recognize. 
Whether you read comics or not, they, are familiar,” 
said Wise, who has been working in the comic book 
industry for the last seven years.
Image Comics was put together by a group of arti­
san writers who worked for Marvel at the beginning of 
their careers. Since comic book companies operate on 
a system called “work for hire,” the creators were 
inventing popular characters and then never seeing 
any of the royalties from the character’s success. 
Frustrated with the market, the writers broke off,
created their own company, and brought artists’ 
rights to the forefront of the industry.
The most popular of Image’s comics at the mo­
ment is Spawn, created by Todd MacFarlane- who 
has become a multimillionaire due the success of 
his comic. With a strongbusiness sense, MacFarlane 
made himself one of the most successful men in the 
comic book industry.
As for general trends in comic books, Wise said 
that things come and go. “[In the ’80s] everybody 
who could hold a pencil was making comics.”
This meant that the market was flooded with 
poor material that hurt the comic industry. “Dur­
ing the ’80s, comics focused on dark, grim, gritty 
characters in the real world. Unfortunately, more 
often than not they focused on violence and the 
anti-hero,” said Wise. Characters wielded hand­
guns and razors, and these types of situations 
overtook the industry.
The backlash from the previous decade was that 
most companies have now returned to more tradi­
tional heroic characters. Some companies started 
their book numberings back at the beginning as a 
marketing technique to attract collectors. As a 
result, sales have picked up.
DC has had great success with their series Jus­
tice League of America, (JLA) which includes many 
of their more popular classic characters that have

COMICS BLUR LINES BETWEEN ART FORMS
By ELAINE BOLAND
Tartan Staffwriter
& ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
To avid readers and collectors, comic books are not just stories for 
children. They’ve expanded greatly beyond their original form — panels of 
pictures that tell a story — to bridge varying forms of media.
The form of the comic book has been around for decades, and some would 
argue, centuries. People expressed themselves by combining words and 
pictures to tell a story well before the first comic book ever appeared in 
circulation in the 19th century. Hieroglyphics, and early forms of religious 
art, such as Trajan’s column in Rome in 113 AD, as well as biblical images 
in stained glass, also told stories sequentially, in a similar manner to 
contemporary comic books.
English civil war pamphleteers drew tiny pictures to get their point 
across. William Hogarth created elaborate engravings depicting the gro­
tesqueness of British society. The first comic books as we know them 
appeared in the ’30s as reprints of popular comic strips. Scholars and 
students have studied how these books evolved as accounts of popular, or 
even political, histories.
Matt Willard, a sophomore in H&SS, self-designed an independent 
research project about comic books to study this topic as part of media 
studies. His study pertains to the comics of the WWII era and how they 
reflected patriotism of the period. They were not read so much by children, 
but by adults. Comics of this time were used as American war propaganda, 
in order to recruit men for military service. For the paper he will write,

Christian Kriegeskotte remembers when he 
first started drawing comic books. “We were on a 
family trip in Germany. We had rented a car, and 
we were driving around in this car we had rented,” 
said Kriegeskotte, a first-year bagpipe major. “My 
sister and I were sitting in the back seat, andl’we 
were] extremely bored. So we started drawing 
comic characters; by the end of the trip I had made 
my first comic strip, Super Cow. And ever since I 
have been doing comic strips.”
Kriegeskotte isn’t the only student with , an in­
terest in comic books. Some students read and 
collect comics, while others also draw their own 
original stories. For many, this interest started as 
a childhood hobby, which turned into a 
serious pastime.
“I remember the first comic book I bought, 
Spiderman,” said Dan Borlja, a sophomore art 
major. “I was eight years old but then I forgot 
about them until high school. Then at ninth grade 
or so I started going to comic stores.”
Borlja draws individual frames — a frame is 
one square (or shape) in a comic book. He draws 
freehand in black and white and then uses the 
computer to enhance the images.
Just as his technique for creating comics has 
become more finely honed, Borlja’s appreciation 
of comics has grown with his experience. “I like 
art,” he said. “I like story, and comics are stories 
with pictures. You have something to look at and 
also to read.”
For some that appreciation has grown into 
aspirations for a lifetime career. “A dream 
job would be having a character which becomes 
popular such:, as Batman or Supej'inan,” said 
first-year art major Joel Heires. “I value [comicsl 
as art.”
Reagan Heller, a first-year design major, has 
already found practical outlets for her interest in 
comics. She draws mostly Japanese anime-style 
female characters, and has done advertising, t- 
shirt design, and computer animation, all using 
her own original characters.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 2 November 1998Exhibit focuses on artistic borders
By RHYS CONLON
Tartan Staffwriter
1 “Everything [in the exhibit] is 
related to the in-between,” said 
Satoru Takahashi, visiting pro­
fessor of art, of his new installa­
tion in the Hewlett Gallery. Along 
with his wife, Keiko Kurachi, he 
.has created Mother Tongue/ 
Name of the Land, which is a 
‘continuation of an exhibit the 
'couple had this past summer at 
¡the Three Rivers Arts Festival. 
He once again focuses on the rel­
evance of borders.
1 * A kitchen-sized table lies in the 
[center of the first room of the 
gallery. It is painted white and 
¡holds two glasses, one on each 
side. Initially, the exhibit seems 
¡quite literal, but upon further 
inspection, you notice the second 
'room in the back, where the scale 
is much larger. The two glasses, 
now shaped for martinis, have 
grown to feel cumbersome and 
reach far above the viewer, giv­
ing the room an Alice in Wonder- 
land-esque quality.
The compositions in both spaces 
'contain similar subject matter,
two glasses set on opposite ends 
of a table, but the different per­
spectives force viewers to be­
come conscious of their connec­
tions between the separate 
rooms and to look for similari­
ties and differences between the 
two. “I wanted to keep the feel­
ing ofjumping,” said Takahashi. 
“Moving from a small table to a 
large table acts as moving from 
small to large.”
The smaller table also ad­
dresses borders on its own. Cov­
ered with curved strips of photo­
montage, the surface illustrates 
various paths as the strips ran­
domly intersect one another. 
“When you .come to a cross in a 
road, an in-between, you have to 
make a decision,” said Takahashi 
as he looked down at his photo­
montages of Pittsburgh and Ja­
pan. He also pointed out that he 
was trying to show miscommuni- 
cation among the diners. “The 
paths don’t always cross,” he said.
The glasses on the small table 
are not free of expression either. 
They cause distractions not only 
from their liquid’s 
magneticallyinitiated funnel but
Lilly Rouhanl/Tartan Art Staff Mother Tongue experimented with size with these martini glasses.
also from the incessant humming 
sound that they make. Behind 
each glass on the wall, the artists 
have written out two rhymes; one 
is the jump rope song, “I like 
coffee/1 like tea/1 like boys/ And 
boys like me/ Yes, no/ Maybe so/ 
Yes, no/ Maybe so.” The other 
song, located on the opposite side 
of the room, contradicts this 
rhyme and begins, “I don’t like 
coffee/1, don’t like tea.”
The first room fits in with the 
show’s objective “To map the im­
plicit connections between these 
conventionally opposed concepts 
rather than criticize them as 
obvious cultural constructs,” 
Takahashi said. The second 
room continues along the same 
lines. The large scale, quieter 
atmosphere, and more intense 
lighting provide contrast to the 
first room, and Takahashi’s in­
tention, which was to cause the 
viewers’ senses to “jump” as they 
crossed from the first space to 
the second, is successful.Comedy helps explain movie's subject
By CLINTON FIELD
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
¦ l Many directors have attempted 
tocapture the emotional devas­
tation of World War II and the 
Holocaust. Few have succeeded. 
Roberto Benigni, in his film Life 
is Beautiful (La Vita E Bella), 
achieves the visceral impact 
sought by so many others.
«
What: Life is Beautiful 
Director: Roberto Benigni 
Company: Miramax
> Benigni, who both directs and 
stars, sets the comedic talent that 
first made him famous in Johnny 
Stecchino against a background 
of Fascism, racial laws, and con­
centration camps. The resulting 
film has already won the Grand 
Jury prize in this year’s Cannes 
¡Film Festival, and has made a 
$itanic-like sweep of the 
‘¡©¿natellos (Italy’s Oscars), in­
cluding awards for Best Picture, 
iActor, Director, and Screenplay.
' £>et in the Tuscan town of 
{¿frezzo in 1939, the film starts 
;as a lighthearted, slapstick ro­
mantic comedy. In the opening
scene, Guido (Benigni) and his 
friend Ferruccio (Sergio Bustric) 
burst into town on an out-of-con- 
trol car, ready to find jobs with 
the help of Guido’s verbose 
uncle. Guido continually 
bumps into a beautiful school­
teacher named Dora (Nicoletta 
Braschi), and he immediately 
falls in love with her. He pro­
ceeds to charm her away from 
her fiancee through a series of 
goofy escapades — he takes a 
horse, paints it green to get 
her attention, and whisks 
her away.
At this point, the scene 
shifts several years forward. 
Guido, now a bookstore owner, 
and Dora have married, and 
have a young son. The town 
has changed, too. Stores now 
bear signs saying “No dogs or 
Jews,” and Guido finds racial 
slurs painted on the front of 
his bookstore. He tries to pro­
tect his son from this ugly new 
world, even as soldiers come to 
take the family away to concen­
tration camps.
The movie draws its power from 
the juxtaposition of the extremes 
of human nature. As we follow
Guido into the concentration 
camp, we still see him as the 
clown and the lover from the first
© 1998 Miramaxin this scene with his son, Guido makes light of an anti-Semitic sign.
part of the movie. Benigni doesn’t 
allow us to forget Guido’s hu­
manity —he never loses the spark 
of life that makes him live on the 
screen. This joviality doesn’t di­
minish the brutality of the camp, 
however. As he desperately tries
to protect his son, Guido’s con­
stant good humor only empha­
sizes the darkness around him.
As tragic as Guido’s world 
appears to be, we would be 
wrong to call this film a trag­
edy. Ultimately, Benigni shows 
us that the power of one spir­
ited human is equal to the 
crushing force of the outside 
world, no matter how powerful 
that force is. This movie can be 
enjoyed on a less intense level, 
too, as Benigni’s constant co­
medic output will appeal to a 
wide range of people, from those 
who fondly remember Charlie 
Chaplin to the modern day fans 
of Jim Carrey. Whether in the 
idyllic town of Arrezzo or the 
industrialized camp, Benigni 
weaves such an entrancing net 
of jokes, pranks, and stories, 
that the audience can almost 
join Guido’s son in believing 
that nothing is truly wrong in 
the world and nothing has re­
ally changed.
Life is Beautiful premiered 
in this country in New York on

; “pet a pair of Vans skate shoes 
or else God will send you straight 
tirhell. No, not really. But that’s 
;what Detroit punk/ska band The 
Suicide Machines (TSM) would 
like you to think. Last Friday, 
when TSM played at Metropol, it 
treated its fans to the favorite 
^Vans Song” among others from 
its two latest albums. The fans 
loved it, at one point forming one 
tif-the biggest circle pits Metropol 
lias probably ever seen. 
v-fThis was TSM’s second-to-last 
show on its nationwide tour. Yet 
they exploded with their charac­
teristic happy ska energy on the
first song without slowing until 
40 minutes later, when its set was 
finished. It was indeed a short set, 
but that is to be expected from a 
band whose songs are seldom 
longer than two minutes each. At 
a punk show it’s the quality, not 
the quantity, that matters.
TSM is motivated by more 
than just Vans shoes and ex­
girlfriends. In the middle of a 
phenomenal set, the Suicide Ma­
chines made a plea for people to 
lay aside their prejudices. Us­
ing the beating death of gay stu­
dent Matthew Shepard as an 
example, lead singer Jason 
Navarro said he was tired of 
watching “things getting all 
fucked up.” This message of open
mindedness is strongly echoed 
in the band’s fourth and latest 
album, Battle Hymns.
Touring with The Suicide Ma­
chines was hardcore band Avail. 
Sandwiched between TSM and 
local pop-punkers D-76, Avail was 
the oddball. These guys looked 
like the odd men out for the night; 
with scraggly beards and long 
hair, Avail looked more like the 
Appalachian Lumbeijack Band. 
Their didn’t sound match the feel­
ing or the message of that of the 
other two bands, leaving many 
people to linger along the walls. 
Worth mentioning, though, was 
the band’s ridiculous-looking, 
mullet-headed backup vocalist, 
who did more talking in between
Film effectively personifies death
songs than singing. “It’s all 
about wrasslin’,” he instructed 
Avail’s fans, rather pointlessly.
Perhaps the best thing about 
a show from TSM is the fact 
that the band helps to main­
tain a hospitable pit atmo­
sphere. While some bands go 
so far as to encourage violence 
in the pit in front of the stage, 
singer Navarro looks out for 
the audience. During the 
band’s set, he returned a lost 
wallet and hat, asked the 
crowdsurfers to be more care­
ful, and even helped some 
front row fans onstage to sing 
along with him. At just nine 
bucks a show, it’s just too good 
to pass up.

Meet Joe Black. Sooner or later, 
everyone does. This film is loosely 
based on the 1934 film Death 
Takes a Holiday. In the 1934 
film, Mr. Mortality visits the 
Earth in the form of a handsome 
prince. He falls in love with a 
woman and agonizes over telling 
her the truth. The same is 
basically true of 1998’s Meet Joe 
Black. Love stories about the su­
pernatural can at times comes 
across as sappy and sur­
real, but Meet Joe Black is 
neither. Its straightfor­
ward nature makes it a 
very enjoyable film.
When we first meet 
Death, he is only a voice 
that haunts Bill Parrish 
(Anthony Hopkins) when 
he’s alone. If that weren’t 
enough, Death is a smart- 
aleck who refuses to give 
a straight answer to any 
of Parrish’s questions.
Well, only one, and the 
answer to that question 
is, “Yes, you are going to 
die.” This all occurs before 
Bill’s 65th birthday. Some 
birthday present.
While all of this is going 
on, Bill’s daughter, Susan 
(Claire Forlani), meets a 
man in a coffee shop (Brad Pitt); 
she never learns his real name. 
When they part, they both keep
Susan comes home and recog­
nizes Joe as the man from thfe 
coffee shop. Little does she know, 
she is about start an affair with 
the man who has come to take 
her father.
/Ijsj What: Meet Joe Black

looking back, wondering if they had originally planned because it
should pursue a relationship with 
the other, but not at the same 
time. The mystery man looks at 
the wrong time. Let this be a 
lesson: Never ever look back be­
cause you might get hit by a car, 
and the vacationing Grim Reaper 
may decide to use your body for 
awhile. Enter Joe Black.
Bill Parrish, Death has decided, 
is a wonderful man, so he is the 
obvious choice to show him 
around while he is on vacation. 
Bill thinks that the choice is a 
rather strange one, but he real­
izes that there’s no way out of it.
is the right thing to do.
Screenwriter Martin Brest uses 
clean, simple language that is 
easy to understand. Lines spo-f 
ken by death are often monosyl4 
labic; they help separate those 
who are living and those who are 
not. The scenes are true to life, 
which could have been difficult; 
considering that he was dealing 
with the supernatural.
Meet Joe Black is an enjoyabl'e 
film because of its simplistic na: 
ture. It’s a straightforward film 
that provides insight on the valufc 
of human life. ICMU artists make original storylines
STUDENT, from page L7
these students grew up reading, 
and many of those classes are 
still popular, as in X-Men or 
Batman. But others are more 
interested in smaller comics, 
such as Preacher, Hellboy, Eight 
Ball, or even larger, more well- 
known comics, such as Spawn.
One convergence between 
CMtTs comic book connoisseurs
is that they all enjoy reading 
them. The students that draw 
their own comics liken the sat­
isfaction they get to the plea­
sure a painter gets from creat­
ing a new painting.
“You read a story so amazing 
that you sit back with a big 
smile and enjoy it as much some 
people enjoy soap operas,”

Historical study of comics shows changes in popular culture
HISTORY, from page L7
Willard plans to analyze the change in 
comic book characters and story lines 
from the WWII era into later decades.
* •. (‘There’s no slipping of any sympathy,” 
said Willard. “You won’t find sympa­
thetic characters until the late ’50s and 
f§0s, where communism becomes the 
ejvil. [Comics] were an outlet, but a very 
riegative outlet, because the people put­
ting [them] together had an audience.”
•' Willard also said that comic book au­
thors and artists created a new stereo­
type of the war and of the enemy. These 
stereotypes played a large role in en­
couraging new recruits to support the 
war effort.
; While many comics of the WWII era 
were geared towards stirring up the na­
tion for war, some were still purely enter­
tainment-based. With the dawn of the 
superhero in the ’30’s in the form of Jerry
Siegel and Joe Schuster’s Superman, ac­
cording to Dooley & Engle’s Superman at 
Fifty, an analysis of the Superman leg­
end, comics took a turn toward the 
fantastical and created a whole new out­
let for storytelling. Currently, comicbooks 
are no longer a vehicle for war propa­
ganda, but for entertainment, social and 
political commentary, and a way to not 
only combine art with story, but with 
many other forms of expression.
Most notably, the film industry has 
brought comic books into mainstream 
popular culture, by taking characters 
from the page to the screen. Even before 
that transition, comic book characters 
made their way into cartoons and short 
films such as The Incredible Hulk ani­
mated series and the classic Saimaa TV 
show of the ’60s.
In recent years, the film industry’s 
blockbusters based on comic books have
begun to break records in popularity. 
The four-film Batman series, which has 
earned more than $1 billion dollars 
worldwide, became one of the power­
houses of fantasy-adventure films. Other 
films, such as The Phantom and Spawn, 
were less successful, but nonetheless 
took popular characters out of the print 
medium.
Some filmmakers have even done the 
reverse, making comic books based on 
movies. Kevin Smith, creator of cult fa­
vorites Clerks, and Mallrats, and Chas­
ing Amy, has already made movies about 
comic books and their collectors. He now 
writes comics for companies such as 
Marvel and DC Comics based on charac­
ters in his films.
But for many collectors and readers, 
these films fall short of the legacy 
created by their characters. While it 
is encouraging to see a character from
a favorite comic make it to the big 
screen, it can be difficult to pack de­
cades of comic storyline into a two- 
hour film.
For Willard, the films lose something 
in the transition. “Comics [are] made into 
movies not for the fans but for the money,”
he said. “They’ll take everything inter-; 
esting out of it, lose the dynamic, like eye 
candy and money spent on special effects
— especially the action books.”
While comic books are branching off 
into other media, they are still just as 
popular in their original form. While 
some scholars debate over the validity 
of comic books as an art form, for true 
fans, there is no debate. Comics stand 
on their own — most consider them to 
be a valid art form much more than 
visual effects.
Whether they be military propaganda 
or simple entertainment, comic book£ 
have created many new categories of; 
artistic expression based on their form,1 
as well as a category all their own. For 
fans, this is sometimes a mixed bless­
ing. Regardless of what form they take, 
comic books are an enduring marker! 
for cultural change.

The Elephant Man
Am I the only one who thinks that David Lynch 
must have had issues “fitting in” as a child? No 
contemporary director other than Tim Burton, and 
maybe John Hughes, has this big an obsession with 
society’s outcasts. In this film, the outcast is John 
Merrick, a man with a horribly disfiguring disease 
living in London during the Victorian era. How 
disfiguring? Let’s just say the phantom of the opera 
is a Teen Beat centerfold compared to this guy. 
Obviously, his deformity along with his many years 
working as a sideshow freak has given him some 
small self-esteem problems. That is until he is 
discovered by Frederick Treves, a doctor who wants 
to study his rare condition and finally takes him out 
of the horribly dehumanizing carnival... and moves 
him to the horribly dehumanizing hospital. What 
do you want? It’s Victorian-era London.

The Truman Show
For a long time, I have said that my life has to be 
a sitcom. When I give a party, the toilet breaks. Of 
course, I know that in reality I’m not on television. 
Or at least that’s what I thought until I saw this 
movie which puts forth the question: What if your 
entire life were on TV and you just didn’t know it? 
That’s what happens to Truman Burbank, a 30- 
year-old man who doesn’t realize that everyone in 
his life is playing a part except for him. His father 
didn’t really die; he just got written out of the show. 
But Truman is starting to get suspicious because 
lights are beginning to fall out of the sky and he can 
stand in a downpour that falls only on him. So, 
maybe I am on TV. And if that’s the case, somebody 
really needs to have a talk with wardrobe. Some of 
the extras need some work.

There’s Something About Mary
If there’s one thing all the men in this movie agree 
with it’s this: There’s something about Mary. She’s 
the reason that her prom date from high school has 
been unable to move on with his life in the seven 
years since his little “accident” in the bathroom (it’s 
not what you think) ruined the evening that was 
supposed to bring them together. But, he’s not the 
only one who loves Mary. Every man she meets is 
willing to lie, steal, beg, and even break out into 
hives just to get closer to her. So, what’s so special 
about Mary? Well, she’s a gorgeous, tall blonde, 
who is wonderful, funny, and doesn’t really care 
what a guy looks like as long as his idea of a good 
time is a baseball game and a couple of beers. Yeah, 
I’d say that’s something all right.

Cannibal:The Musical
Before they were known as the creators of South 
Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker were just a 
couple of film majors living in Colorado who thought 
that the life of Albert Packer, the only American 
convicted of cannibalism, was a story that must be 
told. In song. Parker wrote, directed, and starred as 
Packer in this Troma production. In it he sings 
songs entitled “Hang the Bastard” and “When I was 
on top of you” while he leads a group of gold miners 
and trappers through the Colorado Rockies. In 
their attempt to get to the other side before they eat 
each other, they have to fight against the roaring 
rivers, freezing temperatures, and warring Japa­
nese Indians. Yes, that’s right, Japanese Indians.

Phish
The Story of the Ghost — Elektra
So there’s this band, Phish. Until a few 
days ago, I had heard next to none of their 
music, but had heard of their loyal fan base, 
penchant for jamming, and tremendous live 
shows which didn’t always translate well to
record. Although I still haven’t seen them in 
concert, I listened through a few old albums 
and heard a band moving away from free­
form noodling and towards more structured 
songs, a trend that continues on their latest 
release, The Stoiy of the Ghost.
Phish’s technical skill has never been in 
question — the musicians display a remark­
able ability to work with one another, im­
provising and stretching their tunes to the 
limit. Lyrically, Phish leans more towards 
nonsense than profundity, which only serves 
to enhance the laid-back atmosphere of most 
of their tracks. Singsong refrains, jazzy 
drumming, and accessible guitar work de­
fine the album. The Story of the Ghost is a 
concept album; the record flows well from 
track to track. Frontman and principal 
songwriter Trey Anastasio’s melodies appear 
and disappear throughout the disc, providing 
the band with a flexible framework for each 
song. “Birds of a Feather” and “Wading in the 
Velvet Sea,” two of the album’s highlights, 
revolve around their harmonized titles, while 
“Guyute” serves up the strongest jam.
To some, Phish on record may seem forced; 
it’s difficult for a band known for live perfor­
mances to sound spontaneous on record. With 
The Story of the Ghost, though, Phish has 
written some of their sharpest, most concise 
songs, tracks which work effectively both as 
pop songs and as musical foundations for 
future shows. Phish will never be defined by 
their studio work, but The Story of the Ghost 
is nevertheless a thoughtful, melodic work 
which should delight concert-goers and CD 
buyers alike. — ANDY FRANCIS
On this, his sixth release to date, he and 
his bandmates have opted and progressed 
into a Limp Bizkit-esque sound and formula. 
Hard to Swallow is aptly named because the 
new mutation of Vanilla Ice’s style will shock 
everyone who listened to his music seven 
years ago, when his second album, To the 
Extreme, made, it to the top of the 
Billboard charts.
Vanilla Ice
Hard to Swallow — Republic Records
After ridding himself of his beak-shaped 
hairstyle, lined eyebrows, and funky clothing 
such as plaid pants, the man known through­
out the world as Vanilla Ice has shed his old 
skin to unleash a brand new appearance and 
sound. He has changed into an abundantly 
tattooed, jersey-wearing rock star sporting a 
goatee. Do not expect the old Vanilla Ice that 
brought us the classic hit “Ice Ice Baby.”
The old rap we all grew to know from 
Vanilla Ice is now moved to a heavier level 
with the album chock-full of heavy rock riffs. 
The band will treat the listener to plenty of 
artificial electronic sounds, hairy guitar dis­
tortion, scratching from turntables, and syn­
thesized vocals.
After giving the album a thorough listen, I 
grew to appreciate the direction that Vanilla 
Ice is taking. Whether you would call him a 
sellout for changing his appearance and sound 
to fit the public’s needs or not, one thing stays 
true — this newest effort is worth a listen.
— CLIFF CHIENComic industry adapts to new forms
TRENDS, from page L7
been around since the ’60s, 
ButWise says that there is a large 
selection of offbeat comics to chose 
from, such as Sandman, written 
by Neil Gaiman. It is based on art 
and literature from the past and 
is an amazingly complex story that 
is both horrific and humorous, ac­
cording to Wise.
Another innovative comic is 
300, created by Frank Miller. The 
premise of this tale is a battle 
that took place against the in­
vading Persians during the Greek 
Empire. u300 was researched me­
ticulously, but it is told in a very
dramatic form,” Wise said.
Small companies sometimes 
come out with the best material, 
said Wise. Some manufacturers 
put out one comic book and then 
disappear. “They usually don’t 
have the finances for advertis­
ing, so people don’t know them 
as well.”
Cerebus the Aardvark, written 
by Dave Sim, is one of the best- 
known independent books, ac­
cording to Wise. Sim has been 
producing a new book once a 
month since 1977. “It’s the best­
selling alternative book in his­
tory. Cerebus is Sim’s ‘magnum
opus,’ his life’s work,” said Wise.
Maus, another alternative 
book, which has won the 
Pulitzer Prize, is one of the 
crowning jewels in the history 
of the comic book industry. 
Written by Art Speigelman, it 
tells the story of the Holocaust 
using non-threatening animals, 
such as mice, that represent 
the Nazis, the Jews, and other 
important groups.
Another important group that 
comics specifically address is 
women. “There is a dearth of com­
ics for women,” said Wise. One is 
Leave It to Chance, by Jane
Robinson and Paul Smith, the 
story of a 13-year-old girl named 
Chance Faulkner.
The lack of female heroines may 
have something to do with the 
fact that most creators are male, 
but that is also changing, 
Wise said.
Although things come and go, 
the comic industry has proven its 
ability to adapt to a changing 
world. “It’s an art form that has 
strengths and weaknesses that 
are uniquely its own ,” said Wise. 
“I truly believe that anybody who 
likes to read could find som6- 
thing they like in comics.”

Peanut Butter Lovers' Month
It always came down to a simple choice: creamy or chunky? Long before the familiar 
chants of “Tastes great! Less filling” came the eternal debate over a jar of smooth, creamy 
Skippy or that crunchy, chunky Peter Pan stuff. Usually, you’d slap the good stuff down 
onto slices of white bread and eat sandwiches to your heart’s delight. Sometimes, you’d 
just take a spoon to the jar and chow down. It couldn’t be a jar of cake frosting because, 
well, frosting isn’t peanut butter. No matter how you eat your peanut butter, it’s always 
been an inexpensive way to fill your tummy. But maybe not. According 
to a Consumer’s Union study done several years ago, eating peanut 
butter that contains an average level of only two parts per billion 
of aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen capable of causing liver cancer 
in lab animals, once every 10 days would present a cancer risk 
of seven in one million. Although that sounds like a small 
number, it’s higher than the estimated risk of cancer from 
most pesticides. And that’s conditional upon consuming 
peanut butter only once every 10 days. Luckily, the 
most popular brands of peanut butter — Jif, Peter 
Pan, Skippy, and Smuckers — contain the lowest 
i, levels of aflatoxin, even if they do contain a lot 
VV - of hydrogenated oils, and chemically-altered 
fiats with their own health risks. While there 
are safer alternatives like freshly ground 
almond butter that don’t contain afla- 
toxins, it just isn’t the same.Who does­
n’t want to say that they have some 
carcinogenic peanut butter stuck in the 
roof of their mouth?

Last month, we were struck by a very appropriate use of the Earth issue of 
Dossier. On a rainy October day, we observed a copy of the issue which had 
fallen on the ground, face up, and had been repeatedly trampled over, literally 
rendering it a part of the earth. To continue this pattern, we encourage stu­
dents and faculty to set this issue, Fire, ablaze in glorious flaming tribute. Of 
course, please be careful when burning Dossier around flammable materials or 
small children. Also, don’t forget to read all of the poems and observe all of 
the luscious imagery first, as our visual and verbal representations of fire serve 
as the perfect fuel for any pyrotechnic pursuits.
Fire appears in the poems predominantly as an element of the setting. For 
example, in A Direct Line, a fire place makes the narrator hot. Fire escape puts 
us in the ruins of a burned out apartment. My Father at the Wheel not only 
brings us to a moment before a gruesome accident, but also includes many 
“fire” words. 9/25/98 describes the community created around a campfire.
As expected, cigarettes make their appearance in this issue as well. Late Snack 
at Victorias and Nicotine Addiction both describe how cigarettes can be woven 
so innocently into our lives. Fire and lit cigarettes also make direct appear­
ances in much of diis issue’s imagery, including the layouts for Nicotine Addiction, 
and 9/25/98, as well as Elizabeth Spiridakis’ photograph, 00073496-11.
Some literary magazines can rise above using fire as a metaphor for sex. But 
not Dossier. We like it. Revlon Dye, 1998 takes a simple hair dying and adds 
subtle sexuality. Rhythms sensually illuminates a deep physical moment, but 
adds sparks of light to dark undercurrents in the relationship. Of course, don’t 
forget to check out the cover, which is sexy as hell.
Common, and sometimes cliched, is the idea that youth is associated with 
fire. But 7-19-98 replaces the self-consuming aspects of youthful fire, with a 
joyous exuberance of youth. Whittling describes discovering a youthful center 
that is not only luminous but also pure. The layout for Whittling, expresses a 
quiet, slow burn, a sentiment echoed by many of the pages, including Fire 
Escape and A Direct Line. This approach contrasts with the exuberant visual 
conflagration of James Kuo’s untitled page.
So here it is, issue 3 of Dossier, an unstoppably hot publication, from its sexy 
pink cover to the fiery content inside. While no fire can burn forever, we 
hope to keep the spirit of this issue alive by fanning its flames in a few weeks 
with the Air issue, completing this semester’s elemental theme.

Nicotine Addiction
A
Bryan Kirk
I flip the switch 
to illuminate the backyard.
Slowly, it warms up.
As the light turns bright 
I stand inside 
watching the X-Files.
It's the episode about who actually 
killed JFK and MLKJr. 
and an alien. Who did it?
The Cancer Man did it, 
as we affectionately call him.
A GMC truck commercial 
breaks in, jingling, 
sticking in my head.
I turn to look outside 
and the florescent bulb 
beams through the backyard 
corrupting the moon-made shadows. 
Behind my eyes, I didn't even 
realize it was warming up, 
growing brighter and brighter 
unnoticed like an oven's coils, 
every second without notice.
I walk outside
through the sliding glass door 
into the false light, 
and I spark up a Camel.

This morning an Old Woman came to my house;
She said, “you children who have sat for ages
at the feet of Old Women, and listen to their stories, 
you must listen now to mine.”
I took her in, I gave her some tea, I let her sit by my fire.
I sat down with her and the fire was too warm, 
but I wanted to listen.
She said, “those stories you have heard; they are not true, 
the Old Women that you listen to are liars.”
I was getting thirsty just from looking at her. The heat was becoming 
unbearable,
but still I wanted to listen.
She said, “you must listen to what I tell you.
you must write this down, and then you must burn what 
you have written.”
And she leaned forward and I saw her eyes
(and I saw that she had nothing left behind them but bones and dust, 
and I saw that she had forgotten her family, and she had forgotten her 
name, and she had forgotten her self, and the only thing she didn’t 
forget was what she saw)
And she leaned forward and I saw her eyes
(and I saw what she had seen with her eyes, and I saw the world she 
had lived in for her years and years and years, and I saw what it was 
that she wanted me to burn)
But before I could ask her why, she leaned closer,
She whispered in my ear, “because none of it was true.”

Rhythms
“There is a sickness in me..."
fom Invisible Dreams by Toi Derricotte 'f|
There is a sickness in me. I feel 
the whirl & click
of your breath on my arm.
I remember your car, seats worn
with age, body rusted with use.
1 yielded to the pressure of leather
to your body digging deep, the taste 
of salt on my tongue, of sweat,
your body dark & cautious in the shadows.
Now you lie so quiet beside me,
breathing a slow rhythm.
My breath quick & choppy cannot match
your peace, find sleep. Our future is not as 
certain as your rising and falling chest.
Stacey Jenkins

"Chance sometimes is everything."
-from Valley of the Hoses by Lyubomir Nikolov
The highway lights flicker, headlights burn out 
and the fireflies are carelessly stapled to the sky.
Today you are sober.
The breeze smells of burned pine, 
the traffic horns drone like a pasture 
amidst a great depression.
When the drunk driver swerves and smacks 
into us, the arm that springs from your body 
and locks around my torso is the arm of a father 
trying to save his son's life.
A lunch box rattles and dances in the backseat.
And if you could have predicted the gap 
that would grow between us, would you have 
held on as tightly?
Before our car skids against the bridge's steel girder, 
before the gasoline flames kiss our cheeks, I relax 
In the seatbelt of your bicep and forearm, 
staring up at the highway's tall rocky barriers: 
the rough greys and browns, blurred—their deep 
horizontal erosion, in strips, like skin graft.

9/25/9
so many faces shining 
in the dancing fire... 
the world slips away 
and music grips the soul 
the rhythm of life 
pounds in the earth 
symphony of voices 
creating memories of 
beginnings and ends 
united lives...whispers 
and shouts...crackling 
flames and clinking beer 
bottles...and a lonely 
harmonica guided by a 
man's voice...it is now...
there is nothing else___
i feel as if i dai't 
have to breathe anymore 
this pulsing mass is my 
breath, my life, my love... 
huddled under a bridge, 
gone from the burning 
vision of the world—if 
only for a moment...and 
the fire is always changing... 
colors and temperatures 
glancing over my body...soon 
we will stumble up the shadowy 
stairs and hope our fears
don't follow us in the dark___
and soon there will be sunshine 
and it will dust over these 
ashes and toss them out to the 
waiting world.. .and it will be full.
Braden Moran

---------------------------------------------------

you almost enjoy pointing 
them out—nicked bark, 
fungus spot. Seize a blade. 
Scrape gray knuckles, expose 
rose whorls. You are more 
luminous than you think.
Shake your shoulders, 
let shavings fall like molted 
plumes. Stand naked, limbs 
ribboned with dark veins.
Reach for that core shaped over 
years of wild rain. It knows 
how much it can take.

Late Snack at Victoria
We were munching sandwiches 
on toasted sourdough, cannoli 
under a web of chocolate sauce
when Chester snuck over, 
two of us facing the street, 
steady neon glare of an Exxon sign.
His face sidled up next to Moe’s, 
a flame blipping out of Chesters electric 
grill lighter held under the arugula
and weeping red peppers. He could host 
a Jerry Springer comeback special 
tomorrow, already saddled with extra weight,
introduce Men Who Love Whores
and guys for My Brother Slept With My Ex.
To explain his lisp
he would say I sprained'tny tongue 
trying to tie the cherry stem in a knot.
On that corner in New Jersey,
the cafe owner slapped Moe on the back 
and told us to watch out for Ahman.
We spoke softly, later bound
the oddity with ribbons of laughter. 
Caterpillars of heat from the lampposts 
nibbled at our skin. I wondered
what would have happened
if the pyrotechnic genie
had flown through the sandwich,
singed the scraggly beard 
crawling out of his chin.
Dave Elman

---------------------------------------------------

she's just a little girl 
stampeding through the 
summer days of her youth 
a ball of flames cascading 
towards the future...sunshine 
unaware of cloudy days she 
flitters and bounces with 
unending energy, unyielding 
will...she woke anew to 
a world of wonders that 
seemingly will never cease... 
lands of make believe and 
toys...hour after hour of 
meaningless minutes that 
propel her, thrust her out 
into the great unknown that 
i know all too well... and 
all i can do is laugh at the 
simplicity of life that we 
unwillingly make all too 
complicated...and the mystery 
of her simplicity confounds me 
...i want to secure it in this 
purity and give it back to her

Revlon Dye, 1998
Karen Rigby
Crushed hawthorn 
berries, burnished wood, 
claret. Your hands lather 
my roots with this syrup, 
stroke with a comb.
Strands straight 
as needle-buds, unfolding 
prayers. Petals fall 
on my neck, wet 
paint. Meanwhile rain
patters on the fire escape. 
October leaves blow 
ragged in drainpipes.
You wind the clock.
We wait for color
to permeate. I wring 
my hair in your bathtub, 
flood the wound 
clean. Desperate 
baptism.

---------------------------------------------------



---------------------------------------------------

Now twilight and her fickle rose red fingertips brush the sky 
Now time and thought flashing by in the lifespan of a lit cigarette 
Now sun sinking as a burning ship drowning in the horizon 
Now every sailor fighting to free himself for the better fate
Then the captain dives starboard yelling through drenched beard 
"Then I set this worthless ship ablaze, as will you.
Then better ship's will sail tomorrow, sail to "Elysium."
Then the remains of a charred hulk slunk beneath waves, leaving night.
And I, in my luckless leaky boat, for which I hold no lust
And with one useless oar and a bucket fused to two splintered hands
And living each day pelting brine from the ship
And just to stay afloat in this incomplete death. Why...
I look at my odious companion and realize I am not free.
Rot and barnacles beseige her breasts to leaks
so that I should relent my oar and take up a bucket only
to save her, in reward for her wooden heart and brine lips.
In my white knuckled grip the bucket shatters all over.
They fall. I hear her will of agony, her pitiful dirge.
I remind her that she was just a shooting star 
And it is now time I lay her in the bed of fate.
Mehdi Malekzandi
