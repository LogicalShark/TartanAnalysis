Waste code update will affect renters  
Peduto talks OnePGH at CMU panel
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
This past month, the Pittsburgh 
City Council unanimously passed 
changes to municipal waste code 
619 that will primarily affect rent-
ers and landlords in Pittsburgh. 
The changes will go into effect 
this summer. According to the 
of?ce of Erika Strassburger, who 
spearheaded the changes, the “ul-
timate goal is to make it easier for 
people to recycle and hopefully 
increase the amount of material 
that is recycled.”
Among the changes made, 
new provisions now require 
landlords to “provide both waste 
and recycling storage containers 
for their tenants, these must be 
watertight with close ?tting lids,” 
and to provide Pittsburgh speci?c 
recycling literature “to tenants as 
part of leases,” said Moira Egler, 
Councilperson Strassburger’s 
Chief of Staff, in an interview 
with The Tartan.
In addition to these changes, 
violations of the new waste 
code will now result in notices 
being sent to both the tenant 
and landlord and the mandate to 
recycle will be made more explicit 
in the code itself.
Small recycling changes have 
been clari?ed, as stated in the 
Pittsburgh Public Works waste 
regulations website.
These include the ability 
to place recycling out in blue 
translucent bags and the 
codi?cation of set out times as 
being “no sooner than 6 p.m. the 
day prior to collection, no later 
than 6 a.m. day of collection,” and 
bin retrieval times as being “by 10 
p.m. the day of collection.”
The legislation was an effort 
made in partnership with the 
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Environmental Services and with 
the of?ce of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto. It passed unanimously in 
the council with few amendments.
The only pushback on the 
legislation came from a collection 
of residents that raised concerns 
about the code’s initial bin retriev-
al time, which was that bins had 
to be removed from side streets 
no later than 7:00 p.m. Some 
residents, like those working 
odd hours or with afternoon and 
night shifts, would be negatively 
affected by this set time.
Addressing these concerns, the 
latest possible retrieval time was 
pushed back to 10:00 p.m. in the 
now-passed legislation. Previous-
ly, the legislation did not enforce 
a speci?ed removal time.
In response to the prospect of 
rent increases due to the mandate 
that landlords provide waste 
bins, Egler stated that the of?ce 
“[hasn’t] heard concerns” about 
such an issue, and that “the con-
tainers are pretty reasonably 
priced.” Egler then noted that the 
mandate is speci?cally for “apart-
ment buildings with ?ve and fewer 
units,” and that these changes are 
“common sense provisions that

“Numbers do not speak for 
themselves,” said Sir David 
Spiegelhalter, a world-renowned 
statistician, to a crowd of near-
ly 100 professors and students 
who had gathered in McConomy 
Auditorium to hear him speak. 
“The stories we tell, the way 
they’re packaged makes all the dif-
ference to their emotional impact.”
We are living in the age of 
data. Technology plays a bigger 
role in people’s daily lives than 
ever before, and many of society’s 
core issues can be reframed as 
statistical problems. Yet it is also 
the age of misinformation, and 
the ?eld of statistics is facing more 
challenges than ever before.
Sir David Spiegelhalter’s lec-
ture on Monday, April 22, was 
the second installment of the Ste-
phen and Joyce Fienberg memo-
rial lecture series. Stephen Fien-
berg, who died of cancer in 2016, 
was the head of the Carnegie 
Mellon statistics department. 
He was highly respected and 
in?uential in the ?eld of statistics 
for his dedication to applying 
statistics for societal good. Joyce 
Fienberg, Stephen Fienbergs’s 
wife who perished in the Tree 
of Life synagogue shooting last 
Oct., worked as a researcher 
at the Learning Research and 
Development Center at the 
University of Pittsburgh and was a 
great supporter and friend of the 
statistics department at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“Steve sets a high bar for how 
statistic are communicated,” 
said Sir David Spiegelhalter. In 
his lecture, he focused on how 
statistics are manipulated for 
sensational and persuasive means. 
Spiegelhalter serves as a chair 
at the Winton Centre for Risk 
and Evidence Communication, 
which is part of the University 
of Cambridge’s department of 
mathematics. In his career, he 
has published over 200 papers 
and written several books. He has 
spent the last decade focusing 
on the application of statistics 
to everyday life, appearing in 
numerous T.V. specials on BBC 
and CNN to discuss issues re-
lated to probability and climate 
change. In 2014, he was knighted 
for his service to medical statistics, 
but he jokes that his greatest 
achievement is an appearance on 
the game show Winter Wipeout.
Spiegelhalter explained the 
pipeline of statistical evidence. 
Initially, data is collected by 
researchers and statisticians. 
Their research is then passed on 
to journals and the commissioners 
of the research, all of whom may 
have “selection biases.” Then the

On Saturday, a gunman 
entered a synagogue in Califor-
nia shouting anti-Semitic slurs, 
and opened ?re with an AR-15 
style gun, as reported by The New 
York Times.
The shooting left a 60 year old 
woman dead, a rabbi wounded in 
his hand, and two others injured 
by shrapnel wounds.
It occurred on the Sabbath, 
and the last day of Passover, 
a week-long holiday that 
celebrates Jewish liberation 
from slavery.
The shooting took place at 
the Chabad of Poway. Poway is 
a suburban town about 25 miles 
north of San Diego.
The shooting occurred exactly 
six months after the Tree of Life 
synagogue shooting that jarred 
Pittsburgh and the Jewish com-
munity at large on Oct. 27, 2018. 
It is the most recent in a series of 
deadly attacks in houses of wor-
ship, including the mass shoot-
ing in mosques in New Zealand 
last month and the church bomb-
ings in Sri Lanka last week.
The gunman has been 
identi?ed as John Earnest, a 
19 year old from San Diego. He 
?ed the synagogue after the 
shooting, but soon after called 
the California Highway Patrol 
to report his location and was 
apprehended.
Police are reportedly 
investigating a manifesto that 
was posted on 8chan before 
the shooting, which is ?lled 
with white nationalist conspir-
acy theories and racist slurs, as 
reported by The New York Times.
Last year, a study released 
by the Anti-Defamation League 
found a 57 percent increase in 
anti-Semitic incidents.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the 
chief executive and national 
director of the Anti-Defamation 
League, told The New York Times 
that “This was a pointed attack 
on Chabad, on the visible Jewish 
community here, and this is a 
collective attack on all Jewish 
communities — this is anti-Sem-
itism unleashed.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto 
is continuing his effort to get 
his stalled fund for social and 
sustainable action in Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, off the ground.
A panel this past Thursday 
titled “The City of Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, and Alignment with the 
Sustainable Development Goals” 
brought this discussion to Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. Speaking 
alongside Peduto was the head 
of Heinz College in Washington, 
D.C., Amb. Sarah Mendelson, 
serving as the panel moderator, 
and panelists Leah Lizarondo, 
Heinz alum and CEO of 412Food 
Rescue, Jerry MacCleary, CEO of 
materials company Covestro, and 
Anthony Pipa, Senior Fellow at the 
Brookings Institution.
The talk was framed around 
Pittsburgh’s interpretation of the 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs): 17 markers developed 
by the U.N. as a guide for global 
growth. These goals, Peduto 
claims, align with the 10 areas 
developed by the Rockefeller 
Foundation and the City of 
Pittsburgh for the city’s 12-year 
resiliency plan. These, in turn, be-
came Peduto’s proposed OnePGH 
fund, which would funnel money 
from the city, local nonpro?ts, 
and corporations to organizations 
working toward 47 planned proj-
ects.
Peduto emphasized the 
importance of action on the 
city level, citing a “vacuum of 
leadership in Washington.” 
However, according to Peduto, 
OnePGH is neccesary because the 
City of Pittsburgh does not have 
the leverage to act on its own. 
“[The projects] can’t happen un-
der old models. Old models are 
city government,” said Peduto.
“We don’t have the capacity 
to address hunger and poverty,” 
said Peduto, “but if we create a 
separate organization that then 
helps those that are on the ground 
addressing hunger and homeless-
ness, and being able to use that 
organization to prop up the non-
pro?ts throughout the city and 
this region, then we can get to our 
goals together.”

Students protest Palantir’s tech talk IPS students react to Skinner’s return
University rolls out new school branding
WILSON EKERN
Copy Manager
If you’ve been on campus at 
all this semester, you might have 
noticed the new and improved 
signs outside campus buildings, 
with handy elements like the build-
ing name, its SIO abbreviation, the 
address, and a red square reading 
“Carnegie Mellon University.” Not 
just a refresh of old and worn out 
signage, these markers signify a 
new era in the Carnegie Mellon 
brand. The webpage for the newly-
de?ned “Brand” de?nes it as “the 
perception formed in the mind of 
our audiences at every point of 
contact — verbal or visual,” re-
minding us that “words and imag-
es used to represent the Carnegie 
Mellon University brand re?ect 
who we are as an institution.”
Brian James, the Senior 
Director of Creative at Carnegie 
Mellon, told The Tartan that the 
development of the brand, which 
of?cially launched a few weeks 
ago, was a process that took “in 
its entirety, about two years, just 
shy of two years.” The impetus 
for the brand refresh came with 
the formation of the Marketing 
and Communications group at 
Carnegie Mellon in 2015, with “an 
overall objective to increase the 
awareness and reputation of Carn-
egie Mellon University globally.”
For the ?rst step in this devel-
opment process, Carnegie Mellon 
contracted an “external research 
group” to review “the current 
state of our reputation and the 
current state of our awareness,” 
speaking with students, alumni, 
faculty and staff, and members of 
the general public to get a sense 
of the “different personalities 
that are strong within our univer-
sity.” These personalities formed 
a set of three archetypes which 
form the general idea of Carnegie 
Mellon. According to the “Person-
ality” page on the brand website, 
“CMU’s character, de?ned by our 
rich history and personality traits, 
is equal parts SAGE, HERO and 
OUTLAW,” meaning that not only 
is Carnegie Mellon “INGENIOUS,” 
“PASSIONATE,” and “QUIRKY,” 
but also “BOLD,” “VISIONARY,” 
and “ENTREPRENEURIAL,” that 
last trait one of the signature 
“OUTLAW” characteristics.
These archetypes help guide 
the general mood of the brand, 
the purpose of which is to “cre-
ate the foundation for the 
communications from the uni-
versities,” whether those be blog 
posts, news articles, or general 
media releases from the univer-
sity. The very public nature of the 
brand and its guiding principles 
seems to be unique to Carnegie 
Mellon. Other universities in the 
same vein, such as MIT, Yale, or 
Stanford, lack even basic materials 
about their messaging and media.
In contrast to the bare-bones 
offerings of other universities, 
the brand page includes a full 
gigabyte of university materials, 
from variations on the mascot, 
Scotty, to an abstract, waving 
graphic of Carnegie Mellon’s sig-
nature Tartan pattern, to the pre-
viously-mentioned Carnegie Mel-
lon square that adorns the new 
signage.
According to James, that square 
is a new inclusion in the “visual 
identity downloads from the web-
site,” since designers in the past 
“had to create it on their own,” 
resulting in some inconsisten-
cies. The expanded visual identity 
downloads were a result of “really 
thinking about the students, 
[who] do some fantastic work…
always trying to create pride and 
use the brand.” The university 
sought to “really be collaborative 
with everyone that’s trying to use 
the brand,” and hopes that access 
to these materials will allow 
people to “do the things they need 
to do with it.”
The sleek, comprehensive 
brand identity seems more in line 
with tech companies like Uber 
or Google, with breakdowns of 
the various branding elements 
and motivations. According to 
the brand website, “as a young 
university, [Carnegie Mellon] 
is free from many of the silos 
and bureaucracy that harden 
over time, dimming ambitions 
and slowing momentum,” and 
“whether it’s from Silicon Valley 
or Broadway, Wall Street, Wash-
ington, D.C. or Pittsburgh, innova-
tors and disrupters come to work 
with CMU, because we get things 
done.”
This youthful vigor and close 
collaboration with outside forc-
es seem to exert a correspond-
ing pressure to be as much like 
the hip new startups as possible, 
moving fast and breaking things. 
After all, we Carnegie Mellon out-
laws are “rule benders. [We] veer 
away from conventions, challenge 
authority. Make new rules and do 
whatever it takes to achieve the 
goal.”

This past Wednesday, a group 
of students gathered outside 
Palantir’s tech talk, held in the 
Gates-Hillman Center’s Rashid 
Auditorium. Some students came 
to participate in the recruitment 
event, others were there to join the 
national NoTechForICE movement 
by protesting the recruitment 
event.
The NoTechForICE movement, 
spearheaded by activist group 
Mijente, has sparked protests at UC 
Berkeley, Brown, and Yale, result-
ing in the cancellation of Palantir 
information sessions at Berkeley 
and a “pause” in Palantir’s on-
campus recruitment at Brown.
Analytics company Palantir has 
built two tools for ICE, the Inves-
tigative Case Management (ICM) 
tool and FALCON. The ICM system, 
renewed for around $50 million 
in Aug. is used for managing and 
linking case information, while 
FALCON searches and visualizes 
several law enforcement databas-
es.
In a statement to The New York 
Times, Palantir said the tools were 
meant for the national security-
focused Homeland Security In-
vestigation branch of ICE and not 
the enforcement-focused Enforce-
ment and Removal Operations, 
but Carnegie Mellon protesters 
point to uses of the tools in work-
place raids and logging interac-
tions with unaccompanied minors. 
Palantir did not respond to The 
Tartan’s request for comment.
Carnegie Mellon masters 
student Bonnie Fan launched a 
petition over two weeks ago, asking 
students to stop interviewing for 
positions at Palantir while the 
company is working with ICE. Kev-
in Geng, a junior in computer sci-
ence made a post on the Facebook 
group Overlooked at Carnegie 
Mellon, where students highlight 
social justice issues on campus, 
suggesting that he would stand 
outside of the Palantir event to 
alert potential attendees about the 
company’s involvement with ICE.

career advancement as a student. 
If you want to succeed, you need 
to lean on her connections to 
get you where you want to go 
in D.C.,” said one alum of the 
program. Politico reported that 
Skinner was dismissed from 
her role in the state department 
over an “abusive” management 
style, with anonymous State 
Department sources alleg-
ing that she made homopho-
bic comments, accused people 
of having affairs, and abused 
her authority. In an interview 
with The Tartan, she denied 
making any homophobic re-
marks and characterized some 
of the reporting as being “out of 
context.”
“I think in terms of my 
experience with her as an 
instructor, she was strict but 
fair. It was really when I brought 
up concerns about the new 
masters program where things 
really got out of hand,” said the 
alum. The alum, during their 
time as a student, had brought 
up concerns about the master’s 
program which were perceived 
by Skinner as criticism, leading 
to “nasty” conversations between 
them.
A current undergraduate 
student of the program brought 
up concerns about the reputation 
of IPS. “As a student, it personally 
hurts me to have someone like her 
be the head of the department 
when I’m seeking future work — 
it hurts my personal reputation 
as a Carnegie Mellon student to 
be associated with her and her 
track record.”
Another undergraduate 
student said that they are still 
cautious, as they haven’t been 
here that long, nor do they know 
Skinner personally. Attempting 
to sort through everything that 
they’ve heard and choosing 
what to believe is very 
dif?cult. “Especially among the 
undergrads, we are very scared to 
even talk about what happened

Sustainable campus initiatives expanded
JAMES HAGERTY

Following student requests 
for an Of?ce of Sustainability 
late last month, Carnegie 
Mellon University is touting 
green updates to the school’s 
infrastructure. This past Monday, 
the university announced that it 
is now purchasing wind power.
At the end of last month, 
Carnegie Mellon and ENGIE 
Resources announced energy 
agreements spanning from this 
year to 2024. Carnegie Mellon 
will buy its energy from Radford’s 
Run Wind Farm in Macon County, 
IL for its Pittsburgh campus. 
Eventually, that wind farm will 
serve all campus electricity 
needs.
Steven Guenther, Director of 
Facilities Operations at Carnegie 
Mellon, told The Tartan about 
Carnegie Mellon’s history of 
environmental initiatives and 
the Radford’s Run Wind Farm 
partnership.
Guenther says that “anything 
that uses electricity on campus 
— lights, computers, food 
preparation, air conditioning — 
will be powered by a renewable 
energy source.” The university 
says this effort will make a 
substantial impact, akin to the 
removal of more than 21,000 
passenger motor vehicles from 
highways over a two year span.
Guenther is especially 
optimistic about the merits of 
Carnegie Mellon’s move to wind 
energy. He told The Tartan that 
renewable energy generators, 
like Radford’s Run Wind Farm, 
create two sources of value: elec-
tricity and, following federal law, 
a renewable energy certi?cate 
(REC) upon generating one 
megawatt-hour of power.
“The REC represents the social 
and environmental bene?ts of a 
megawatt-hour of clean energy. 
You can think of it as the mirror 
image of a carbon tax; rather than 
putting a negative value on car-
bon emissions, it puts a positive 
value on clean generation,” 
Guenther explained.
Carnegie Mellon’s energy 
usage is tracked by its Green-e 
certi?ed RECs, as the university 
has spent the past decade 
offsetting its electric power 
consumption by purchasing 
RECs.
“Buying 100% renewable 
energy is exciting and supports the 
Provost’s recent announcement 
of the Sustainability Initiative. 
The wind power commitment is 
one of many examples of engaged 
efforts in support of the broader 
de?nition of sustainability 
afforded by the United Nations’ 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs),” Guenther told us.
Other campus environmental 
initiatives include the 
installation of almost 500,000 
gallons of rainwater storage 
for reuse in campus buildings, 
which will offset municipal 
water consumption and reduce 
the burden on the sewer sys-
tem. Spots on campus like the 
rain gardens in front of the 
Cohon University Center and the 
Posner Center’s green roof are 
an extension of this effort. The 
Tepper Quadrangle, opened last 
year, was Carnegie Mellon’s 22nd 
LEED certi?ed campus project.
“The biggest sustainability 
initiative in our history could 
be the Provost’s commitment 
to grow awareness of the 
United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals and elevate 
the university’s engagement with 
the SDGs,” Guenther noted.
The Association for the 
Advancement of Sustainability 
in Higher Education (AASHE) 
acknowledged Carnegie Mellon’s 
environmental initiatives, 
awarding them with gold status 
(surpassing the university’s 2015 
silver rating). Carnegie Mellon 
also ranked 63rd in the nation in 
Sierra Club’s 2019 Cool Schools

     On Oct. 5, 2019, the Pittsburgh 
March for Peace walked from 
Schenley Plaza to the Software 
Engineering Institute, and 
then to Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus entrance to protest 
the university’s involvement 
with the United States military. 
In one distributed pamphlet, 
organizers stated that “your 
presence [at this protest] shows 
the militarists, CIA goons, 
and war hawk politicians that 
people in America are sick of 
war and are willing to do some-
thing about it.”
     The protest was endorsed 
by several local organizations, 
among them, the Allegheny 
County Democratic Black 
Caucus, the Green Party of 
Allegheny County, the Thomas 
Merton Center, and the 
Veterans for Peace of Western 
Pennsylvania.
     As the group marched from the 
Software Engineering Institute to 
Carnegie Mellon’s Walking to the 
Sky, protesters chanted, “No tech 
for ICE.” Protesters objected to the 
development of technology for 
law enforcement and the military 
at Carnegie Mellon. In a Veterans 
for Peace of Western Pennsylvania 
description of the 
protest, organizers 
note that they seek to 
“end Pittsburgh’s role 
in the global military 
industrial complex 
that exploits so many 
in the name of pro?t 
rich and wealthy.”
 The protest had 
three main demands, 
according to another 
distributed pamphlet. 
They were: 
   “1. We demand an 
immediate end to all 
forms of war in which 
the United States is 
currently engaged. 
2. We demand an 
immediate reduction 
of the U.S. military 
budget by at least 
half, including 
nuclear weapon 
divestment, with 
reinvestment into social and 
infrastructure programs. 
3. We demand an end to the 
militarization of domestic law 
enforcement organizations.”

Mellon Institute Auditorium
2019 Buhl Lecture
Citing Palantir’s ICE contracts, students protest campus talk
student organizers met to ?gure 
out what kind of action might take 
place. A Facebook event circulated 
that night, linking articles about 
protests at other universities, as 
well as Fan’s petition.
Though the protest circulated 
through the channels of campus 
activist organizations, according to 
Fan, the event was carried out by 
a coalition of students who were 
concerned about “larger issues 
around recruitment.” Fan says that 
there are people who want to think 
about social impacts of recruiters 
around campus, but “there isn’t 
really a space for that.”
Carnegie Mellon spokesperson 
Jason Maderer emailed a statement 
to The Tartan that highlighted 
the ?rst amendment rights of all 
involved, saying “the university 
supports both the rights of the 
students protesting and those who 
wish to consider employment with 
a particular employer. We worked 
with the sponsoring department 
about this week’s event in order to 
allow for freedom of expression, 
engagement, and exchange of 
ideas.”
While Palantir held open “of?ce 
hours” for students, protesters 
handed out ?yers in Spanish and 
English in the entryway to the 
Gates Center off of the Pausch 
Bridge. Once the tech talk began, 
the protesters moved outside the 
fourth-?oor auditorium where 
it was held, moving outside of 
the fourth-?oor Forbes Avenue 
entryway to give speeches.
Alisar Mustafa, a masters 
student who helped organize the 
protest, was surprised that people 
showed up, given that the protests 
had largely been planned the night 
before. She believes that the fact 
that the protests speak “speci?cally 
to ICE and deportation” might 
make them more accessible to the 
large international population at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“It’s hard to draw the line,” said 
organizer and masters student, 
Brian Rhindress, to identify 
employers meriting protest since 
Carnegie Mellon draws many big 
recruiters involved in defense 
and law enforcement. However, 
Rhindress says, while there are 
a lot of students parsing which 
employers meet their ethical 
standards, there are “a lot of 
students who just don’t know.”
Palantir’s tech talk itself 
centered around a demonstration 
of one of Palantir’s software 
platforms in the scenario of a 
?ctionalized automobile recall. 
Palantir security asked attendees 
to refrain from taking photos or 
tweeting during the event.
The ?rst several questions in the 
Q and A portion of the event came 
from protesters. Atahan Kiliccote, 
a sophomore in Mechanical 
Engineering, asked about the use 
of Palantir’s FALCON platform 
in ICE raids. Responses from 
Palantir recruiters focused on the 
distinction between working with 
the investigative and enforcement 
branches of ICE, and the internal 
discussion process that led to the 
choice to continue working with 
ICE.
Eventually, one of the attendees 
asked about the difference 
between the kinds of engineers at 
the company, and the discussion 
moved to more standard fare. 
Soon after, the question portion 
ended, and the recruiters invited 
interested students to the front to 
network.
Atahan Kiliccote, mentioned in 
this article, is also a staffwriter at 
The Tartan.
because it’s just not within our 
power. There’s an obvious, 
huge, power gap between us, 
as undergrad students, and 
Skinner, who’s the head of the 
department.” It’s dif?cult, they 
say, to ask questions, since as 
an undergrad in the department 
“your chances are riding on what 
you say and what you do.”
Several students want the 
administration to be more 
transparent. “CMU de?nitely 
struggles with the perception 
that it doesn’t care about 
its students,” remarked the 
previously mentioned alum.
“CMU loves to be neutral 
on everything; as long as Dr. 
Skinner didn’t literally set ?re 
to the White House, they’ll 
be okay with her,” a current 
student expressed. “And it’s 
really unsettling that Dietrich 
just wants to bury this instead of 
addressing it head-on.”
Another student commented, 
“I think transparency is just the 
biggest thing. Because right now, 
what it feels like is happening 
is just everyone’s left in the 
dark, and we’re just hearing 
from outside sources and vague 
statements from Skinner and 
trying to maybe address what’s 
going on but not really. If people 
were more forthright and direct 
about what’s going on, I think 
the students would feel less 
ambivalent about the situation.”
In an interview with the 
Tartan in September, Skinner 
admitted that she misspoke 
when she made a controversial 
statement during a security 
forum in Washington D.C. 
regarding the U.S.’s relationship 
with China as a growing power. 
Skinner had said, “it’s the ?rst 
time that we will have a great 
power competitor that is not 
Caucasian,” and accepted that 
the criticism directed towards 
her was legitimate. She clari?ed 
that “China is very different than 
other competitors we have had” 
and that “we have to take China 
on its own terms. A lot more 
seriously.”
Skinner is holding a 
discussion on US-China relations 
on Monday. In an email announc-
ing the event, she acknowledged 
the previous controversial 
remarks she had made during 
her tenure in the State Depart-
ment on competition between 
US and China. She wrote, “It is 
therefore my duty as an academic 
within a world-class univer-
sity to open up dialogue with 
our students to hear their con-
cerns about US-China relations, 
with particular regard to global 
competition and the trade war, 
so that we can work together 
towards building a strong US-
China policy.”
One of the students who 
spoke to the Tartan welcomed 
the event, expressing hope that 
“being able to hear it directly 
from her” instead of from the 
media, which they said could 
be con?ating and exaggerating 
her points, would help get more 
insight into her foreign policy 
thinking and her controversial 
statements. “In regards to the 
other more personal issues, I 
don’t think that will probably 
ever be addressed,” the student 
said.
Skinner declined to comment 
on this article, saying she could 
not effectively respond without 
advance viewing of the article.
The discussion on US-China 
relations will be held on Monday, 
Oct. 7, from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 
p.m. in the Cohon University 
Center’s McConomy Auditorium. 
A second meeting, also led by 
Skinner, was announced Sunday 
night, which all IPS students and 
faculty are invited to attend. That 
meeting will take place from 5:30 
p.m. to 6:30 p.m. in the same 
location, immediately after the 
previous meeting.

Carnegie Mellon is af?liated 
with a few environmental 
groups, including the AASHE

Mellon’s Scott Institute for 
Energy Innovation hosts Energy

leaders from 67 academic energy 
institutes and centers from 32 
states to discuss future energy 
initiatives.
Though Carnegie Mellon 
does not have an Of?ce of 
Sustainability, it now has a new 
advisory council focused on 
engagement with the SDGs set 
by the United Nations General 
Assembly in 2015.
In a statement, Guenther 
stated that “our university’s 
focus includes education, re-
search, and practice in building 
environmentally sustainable, 
peaceful, just and inclusive com-
munities. We are blessed with 
wonderful people doing amazing 
work on issues connected to the

ed to discover our strengths and 
weaknesses to inform a future 
decision.”

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
CMU: get politically active!
In 1969, The Tartan reported 
that the Carnegie Mellon Student 
Senate claimed: “a demonstration 
on the CMU campus was about 
as unlikely as a meteor hitting 
Warner Hall.” A week later, that 
statement was proven false when 
students and faculty marched to 
protest campus construction and 
supported the Black Construction 
Coalition and black construction 
workers in Pittsburgh. Even at the 
time, the student body was known 
to be “apathetic,” but that protest 
showed that students cared about 
the issues and have the ability to 
get involved.
There are a lot of parallels 
that can be made between then 
and now. Both periods are eras 
of political turmoil and identity 
shifts in a polarized landscape, 
so it is becoming increasingly 
important for us to be involved. 
Our senators, representatives, and 
executive branch don’t represent 
the nation’s best interests. The 
cliché idea thrown around is that 
our generation is the only one 
capable of ?xing the mess left 
behind by decades of bad policy 
and half-measures based on 
compromises with saboteurs who 
were only in it for their own gain. 
While we certainly are not the 
only ones capable, we are the ones 
who will have to deal with the 
consequences. It’s our obligation 
to be involved and change the 
course of our present and future.
So how does our campus step 
up to the obligation to be involved 
with the issues? We spoke to 
24 students across campus and 
asked them three questions: First, 
how politically involved are you? 
Second, how politically aware do 
you ?nd the campus body as a 
whole? Third, what are the ways 
Carnegie Mellon students can get 
more involved in the issues?
For political involvement, 
six people answered “really 
involved,” (four of them were 
international relations majors) 
eight people answered “somewhat 
involved,” ?ve people answered “a 
little bit involved,” and ?ve people 
answered “not interested at all.” 
But in response to the question 
regarding political awareness 
on campus, only four people 
answered “really involved” while 
14 out of the 24 respondents 
answered “a little bit involved.” 
The six respondents who 
answered “somewhat involved” 
for this question also strongly 
indicated that students could do 
more. “It’s de?nitely better than 
I thought it would be for a tech 
school,” says Nick Bellante, a 
junior studying both international 
relations and politics and policy 
and management.
Of course, this shouldn’t be 
taken as a statistically signi?cant 
representation of campus political 
awareness, but it still speaks 
volumes that many students in a 
relatively random survey, most 
of whom aren’t connected to 
each other beyond going to the 
same university, were critical 
of the campus’s lack of political 
awareness. It’s disheartening to 
see because it’s important for the 
student body to understand the 
political and ethical rami?cations 
of the work that the university 
is engaged in, such as military 
research.
“I can count on one hand the 
number of protests that have 
happened at CMU. Can you think 
of a lot of the direct actions that 
have happened at CMU in the 
last year?” says Maggie Oates, a 
Ph.D. student studying societal 
computing.
Many respondents were quick 
to point out why they thought this 
was the case. Some noted the job 
prospects for students. “People 
at this school especially are more 
focused on the monetary aspect of 
their degree, like ‘can this degree 
get me paid?’” says Ruel Beresford, 
a junior double majoring in 
biochemistry and international 
relations and politics. Others 
noted the university’s work 
culture as a signi?cant factor in its 
political apathy. “We’re all so busy 
that we can’t be expected to know 
everything about everything, but 
I still think that’s not an excuse 
to not know anything,” says Yash 
Hari, a senior studying statistics 
and machine learning. Some 
international students also noted 
their discomfort. “The thing is I 
am international, so I don’t like to 
give my political views here,” says 
Spandan Sharma, a sophomore 
studying electrical and computer 
engineering.
Career building is one of the 
goals of coming to college, but 
it’s not an excuse to ignore the 
impact of the tech giants who 
hire our students. Students who 
don’t take the time to research the 
company or contractor they want 
to work for further enables these 
companies to engage in dubious 
work. However, the university 
should be doing more to engage 
with companies who aren’t doing 
work for institutions that violate 
human rights. Additionally, 
students shouldn’t be so caught up 
in their work and career goals that 
they forgo political involvement. 
These conversations are dif?cult, 
and it won’t be possible if people 
check out because they don’t 
want to deal with it. We should 
encourage each other, including 
international students, to take 
part in the discourse.
That leaves us with the ?nal 
question: what are ways to 
get Carnegie Mellon students 
more involved? All the survey 
respondents had a wide array of 
answers.
“There should be four 
required courses for everyone at 
the university, especially STEM 
majors: an ethics course, a politics 
course, a history course, and a 
writing course,” says Austin Goetz, 
a junior majoring in international 
relations and politics.
“There should be more signs 
everywhere having students 
register to vote,” says Omar 
Elmady, a junior majoring in 
psychology.
“It would be cool to see 
university sponsored, non-
partisan events that are from [the 
university’s] point of view rather 
than just having clubs sponsoring 
it,” says Navid Mamoon, a 
sophomore studying business 
administration.
“If we reduce the stress culture, 
then students will ?nd the time to 
join organizations and be able to 
be more politically involved and 
think about these types of issues 
instead of just constantly thinking 
about the next assignment,” says 
Reneé Nikolov, a sophomore 
studying international relations 
and politics and behavioral 
economics.
There is a shifting dynamic on 
campus with students wanting 
to get more involved, and many 
of them have indicated their 
ideas on what the student body 
and administration should do. 
It’s on us all to get involved, 
and we should be doing all that 
we can to do so, including our 
administration.
Inquiry for a POTUS impeachment begins
LAUREN KELLY
Staff Writer
Living through the Trump 
Administration has been exhausting, 
the past three years feeling like three 
decades. We have found ourselves 
wondering if each political scandal 
would be the scandal.
On Sept. 24, Speaker Pelosi 
announced a formal impeachment 
inquiry into President Donald 
J. Trump. He is now the fourth 
President of the United States to face 
impeachment.
A few weeks ago, there were 
rumors of a whistleblower complaint 
in the intelligence community, which 
alleged that Donald Trump withheld 
foreign aid to Ukraine until they 
committed to investigating Hunter 
Biden, Former Vice President Biden’s 
son. These rumors, which took 
Washington by storm, were quickly 
proven to be true. On CNN, Rudy 
Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney, 
stated that the President asked 
Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. 
Trump also con?rmed this to be true 
when pressed by reporters on the 
White House lawn.
Corroborating evidence for 
these admissions came when the 
White House released a summary 
of the transcript of Trump’s call 
with President Zelensky of Ukraine. 
The summary alone is damning for 
Donald Trump. On it, when President 
Zelensky brings up U.S. military aid 
to Ukraine, Trump says, “I would like 
you to do us a favor though.” This is 
the very phrase that historians will 
mention when writing about Trump’s 
impeachment process.
Two days after Speaker Pelosi 
announced a formal impeachment 
inquiry, the House Intelligence 
Committee released the whistleblower 
complaint, which corroborated 
everything in the call transcript with 
Ukraine. The complaint con?rmed 
that other people witnessed Trump’s 
mob-like behavior with Ukraine, 
which the Committee is continuing to 
investigate.
Though we have long known 
about Trump’s violations of the 
Constitution’s emoluments clause and 
his obstruction of justice as relayed 
in the Mueller Report, this Ukraine 
whistleblower scandal has struck a 
chord with the American people. The 
President of the United States violated 
the Constitution by asking a foreign 
government to interfere in the 2020 
presidential election, threatening to 
withhold taxpayer-funded foreign 
aid. This behavior should not be 
normalized, and it seems that the 
House Democrats are ?nally prepared 
to uphold their Constitutional duty.
Throughout the many scandals 
of the Trump Presidency, Democrats, 
including Maxine Waters, Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and 
Al Green have repeatedly called for 
Trump’s impeachment. Nancy Pelosi 
has had a more methodological 
approach, preferring to work through 
the courts instead of impeachment 
procedures. It is important to realize 
that although Speaker Pelosi did 
not reach her decision to open an 
impeachment inquiry quickly or 
enthusiastically, she knew that it 
was the only way to protect what the 
Founding Fathers imagined for our 
country.
Conducting an impeachment 
inquiry on Donald Trump is risky, 
especially for the many moderate 
Democrats in the House that ?ipped 
red districts. Speaker Pelosi was slow 
to open impeachment into Trump 
because she wanted to protect these 
representatives, many of whom now 
support impeachment due to growing 
demands from their constituents, 
but with the Ukraine whistleblower 
scandal, it seems that there is a bigger 
political risk for the Republicans and 
some conservative Democrats who 
continue to stay silent on the matter. 
Public opinion polls from Morning 
Consult and Politico show that 
51% of Americans support Trump’s 
impeachment, a number that has 
never been higher.
This scandal has Republicans 
sweating. Kevin McCarthy, Minority 
Leader of the House, went on 60 
Minutes to defend Trump and his 
administration. McCarthy’s interview 
with Scott Pelley was almost too 
brutal to watch. Republicans usually 
excel in conducting uni?ed messaging 
strategies, but it is clear that they 
are not sure what to do in this given 
circumstance. They are terri?ed to 
speak out against Trump, for fear of 
not being reelected. Former Arizona 
Senator Jeff Flake said that he talked 
to his former colleagues and that if the 
impeachment vote in the Senate were 
anonymous, at least 30 Republicans 
would vote to convict Trump. This 
is the Republican Party’s last chance 
to choose between Trump and the 
Constitution of the United States.
So, how can Democrats win 
this political ?ght? They already 
are winning. They chose to open 
an impeachment inquiry to protect 
and defend our Constitution, and 
ensure that our elections are free and 
fair. Mitch McConnell, the Majority 
Leader of the Senate, has vowed to 
stop impeachment from going to the 
Senate in his latest fundraising push, 
which is similar to how he has not 
taken up any of the legislation that the 
House passed in this new session of 
Congress.
In the 2020 election cycle, 
Democrats aim to ?ip several seats 
in the Senate. The last thing the 
Senate Republicans want to do is 
vote on impeachment. Senators like 
Susan Collins, Martha McSally, and 
Cory Garder are among the most 
vulnerable Republicans, and a vote 
against impeachment could cost them 
their re-election, given that their states 
have been trending blue in recent 
years.
Impeachment votes are not 
anonymous, and the Republican 
Party is now the Party of Trump, 
so it is unlikely that Congressional 
Republicans will risk their reelection 
on an impeachment vote. When an 
impeachment is brought to the ?oors 
of both chambers of Congress, many 
Republicans — and possibly some 
moderate Democrats — will vote 
against it. That “nay” vote will be a 
stain on their records. The history 
books will show that these are the 
individuals who chose power over 
protecting our constitution.
When announcing the 
impeachment inquiry, Speaker 
Pelosi quoted the Founders, saying, 
“the times have found us.” And, 
when these times are over, those 
members of Congress that voted 
against impeachment to protect their 
political futures will be remembered 
as cowards and traitors to the United 
States of America.Simin Li/Staff Artist

FRANK HU
Operations Manager
Investing in stocks is an 
expensive venture. Depending on 
the stocks you’re interested in, the 
price per share can be well over 
$1,000. Amazon (AMZN) and 
Alphabet (GOOG), for example, 
have a price per share of around 
$1,725 and $1,200, respectively. 
To own even one share of these 
companies would require a 
nontrivial sum, not to mention 10 
or 20 shares.
Moving away from the high 
end of the spectrum, the cheaper 
options out there still boast 
substantial price tags. Companies 
like AT&T (T), Wells Fargo (WFC), 
and Coca Cola (KO) hover around 
$35 to $50 per share. While much 
more affordable than the $1,000+ 
per share seen previously, it’s still 
not cheap to become invested in 
these securities. You could opt for 
even cheaper stocks and possibly 
venture into the penny stock 
territory, but that often comes with 
higher risk and higher volatility.
Knowing this, wouldn’t it be 
great if there was an investment 
vehicle where you could own lots 
of companies at once without 
shelling out thousands of dollars 
at a time? That’s the exact 
philosophy behind both exchange-
traded funds (ETFs) and mutual 
funds, both of which give investors 
diversi?cation in holdings at 
a lower price as opposed to 
picking individual securities and 
investments.
ETFs and mutual funds 
are similar in that both have 
an underlying collection of 
investments, often focusing on one 
market sector. When investors buy 
into an ETF or a mutual fund, they 
indirectly invest the money into 
the securities contained in that 
fund rather than having to pay 
the price per share for each stock 
or investment, which means that 
the initial amount one has to shell 
out is a lot lower. This means that 
instead of buying shares of Exxon 
(XOM), Apple (AAPL), and Adobe 
Systems (ADBE) separately, you 
can buy into a fund that tracks the 
S&P 500 and invest in these and 
many other stocks automatically 
for a far lower price. Investing in 
a fund means you’re investing in 
a pre-made portfolio, and your 
fortunes depend on how well the 
constituents of that portfolio are 
doing.
With a low price tag, instant 
diversi?cation, and more balanced 
risks, it’s easy to see why funds 
are so popular: they take the 
guesswork out of investing and are 
a great way for beginning investors 
to gain a foothold in the market, 
especially those who do not have 
the time to monitor the market 
and want a passive investment 
approach. Furthermore, most 
funds only boast a modest expense 
ratio: the fees you pay for owning 
some of the funds. This means 
that the amount you’re losing to 
fees is generally outweighed by 
your gains, though this is highly 
dependent on the performance of 
the ETF.
There are two key differences 
between ETFs and mutual funds 
that are important to understand 
before investing in either one. 
First, ETFs are traded like stocks 
whereas mutual funds are traded 
only at the end of the day. This 
means that if you want to buy 50 
shares of an ETF, the Vanguard S&P 
500 ETF (VOO) for example, you 
can execute that order instantly 
and get the market price you saw 
at the instant that you decided to 
buy. Once the order is executed, 
you then own 50 shares of the ETF 
and that’s that. ETFs can also be 
traded like stocks, so selling and 
buying them are performed like 
any other routine transaction on 
the market.
Mutual funds, on the other 
hand, are traded at the end of 
the day. For example, say that 
you wanted to buy into a mutual 
fund during the trading day, and 
say that its current trading price 
is $40 per share. You then initiate 
a trade by putting up $1000, but 
the trade is not executed at that 
moment. Instead, you must wait 
until 4:00 pm EST before the trade 
goes through, and your $1000 is 
used to purchase as many shares as 
possible at the closing price. Thus, 
purchasing a mutual fund puts 
you at risk of price ?uctuations 
throughout the day.
The second key difference is 
that mutual funds are actively 
managed while ETFs are not 
always managed. This means that 
an actual portfolio manager is 
overseeing the operations of the 
mutual fund, whereas ETFs are 
passively managed and simply 
track their target market sector. 
While it may sound comforting 
to hear that your money will 
have more oversight in a mutual 
fund, it’s important to note that 
most actively managed funds 
fail to outperform passively 
managed funds in the long-term. 
It’s for this reason that in recent 
years, ETFs have become more 
popular than mutual funds as 
an investment tool among both 
active and passive traders. Simply 
tracking the market rather than 
trying to game the market leads 
to average and consistent returns 
over time and minimizes the risks 
that come with frequent buying 
and selling of securities. That’s 
not to say that ETFs and passively 
managed funds never change: all 
funds are rebalanced depending 
on the performance of the market, 
so fund compositions are rarely 
immutable.
So, with this general oversight 
of ETFs and mutual funds, the 
question remains: how do you 
invest in these funds?
The answer is simple, just go out 
and buy shares of a fund via online 
trading or brokerage account! 
With online trading services 
from companies like Vanguard 
and Fidelity, buying securities on 
the market is easier than ever. Of 
course, before you buy you should 
?rst do your research on what 
the fund is focused on and what 
its outlook is. If a prospectus is 
offered, and it usually is, take the 
time to read it. The prospectus is a 
packet of information for potential 
shareholders and outlines both 
the expenses of investing in the 
fund and its major holdings, as 
well as the projected growth of 
a $10,000 investment. And as 
always, when it comes to buying 
securities, understand that 
your time in the market is more 
important than timing the market. 
This is especially true with funds 
since you are exposed to a mix of 
investments rather than individual 
company stocks. Holding on to 
investments for the long term 
is better than rapid buying and 
selling since you don’t miss out on 
long-term growth and dividend 
payments. Volatility in the short-
term is unnerving, but understand 
that in the long-term, the market 
generally trends upwards. There 
is always the risk of losing money 
when investing, so be sure that you 
never invest more than you can 
afford to lose.
Next time, we’ll talk about 
trading commodities on the 
market and how things like oil, 
gold, and silver can be traded 
much like stocks.
Accounting for your life: managing funds
LETTER TO THE EDITOR: GIVE THE ARENA A CHANCE
The arena is brutal, unforgiving, 
very public — and yes, at times, 
rewarding. Whether you are 
in policy, sports, academia, or 
business, the characteristics of the 
arena are basically the same. And 
despite its shortcomings, the arena 
is where lasting impact happens, so 
take the plunge.
In one of my earliest forays into 
the arena, I ran for class of?ce when 
I was in 7th grade. Each candidate 
gave a speech to the student body 
during an outside assembly. I 
arrived in a pink dress, white 
stockings, ballet ?ats, perhaps a tad 
of makeup, and a bow in my long, 
?owing hair. The other contenders 
wore jeans and T-shirts.
I knew I was pushing the 
envelope, but I also knew that 
I had to give a strong address. I 
wanted to break the color line in 
my school’s elections. I wanted 
to change the conversation on 
campus. I wanted more open-
minded and informed teachers. I 
wanted them to recognize Egypt 
as part of the African continent, 
and I was furious when they 
refused to do so. I had a voice, I 
wanted to lead, and I was forceful 
in my delivery. With only 35 black 
kids in a student body of 700, I 
thought I needed a theme to catch 
everyone’s attention, so I had titled 
my campaign speech “Chance.” 
I said, “Give me a chance just the 
way the tennis world gave Billie 
Jean King a chance.” (Billie Jean 
had become one of my idols when 
she defeated Bobby Riggs in the 
Battle of the Sexes). At the end of 
my speech, the cheerleaders went 
wild and the whole crowd joined in 
to give me a standing ovation.
By that point, I was well on my 
way to becoming a serial class-
of?ce seeker. Throughout my 
school days, I would win some 
elections by convincing enough 
classmates to vote for me, but I’d 
also lost some contests. This time 
was different. I won the election 
but the school authorities claimed 
I had lost. Tipped off by a teacher 
who was skeptical about the 
outcome, my mother demanded 
a recount. As it turned out, I had 
won by a landslide. My “Chance” 
speech might have been too strong 
for some faculty members and 
administrators, who were probably 
responsible for changing the results 
of the election. It was a dramatic 
and highly unusual situation for 
my California junior high school. 
I assumed my of?ce and, to my 
knowledge, that was the last time a 
student election was compromised 
at my junior high school.
I was reminded of that episode 
when I was dismissed recently from 
the State Department. In the U.S. 
federal government, there is but 
one think-tank for foreign policy: 
the Of?ce of Policy Planning at 
the State Department. Because of 
the pace of U.S. foreign policy and 
demands on the Secretary of State 
and the President, policy planning 
has become an extension of the 
Secretary of State’s operations. 
Secretary Pompeo wanted a 
course correction and tasked me to 
manage it. I took him literally and 
attempted to do it all at once.
From the ?rst day on the job, I 
began assembling interdisciplinary 
teams of career of?cials and 
political appointees, including 
faculty from civilian and military 
universities and think-tank 
scholars, to work on regional and 
functional problems. I unleashed 
them to de?ne the Trump Doctrine, 
turning the president’s hunches 
into hypotheses, and I watched 
with admiration as they engaged 
hundreds of State Department 
of?cials in red-team exercises on 
Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and other hot 
spots. The Policy Planning Staff led 
meeting groups on a dozen cross-
cutting challenges such as the use 
of sanctions to change the behavior 
of foreign leaders and public 
diplomacy for the 21st century. 
Policy planning was on its way back 
to the original model.
I have found that people who 
are deeply invested in an enterprise 
welcome rapid change and support 
their leader. Those who are invested 
in the status quo, however, can be 
formidable in obstructing progress. 
Often, their objectives tend to be 
narrow and clear: tackle and block.
So, know the following: if 
you succeed only in shifting 
the expectations about what is 
possible, you will have won. In 
other words, you win even when 
the authorities say you have lost. 
To this day, I consider “Chance” 
to be my best political speech, one 
that continues to inform all of my 
actions inside the arena. At State, I 
took a chance, and have in?uenced 
the expectations about what is 
possible.

Joker: re?ection of our society
DAVID KOGGAN
Junior Staffwiter
“What do you get when you 
cross a mentally ill loner with a 
society who abandons him and 
treats him like trash? You get what 
you f**king deserve.” This is the 
last thing Arthur Fleck says as he 
completes his transformation into 
the titular Joker with a graphic 
display on national television.
Leaving the theater last 
Thursday, I felt gross and numb as 
I tried to make sense of what I had 
just witnessed. Multiple critical 
reviews described Joker as being 
something of “an anthem for incels” 
— involuntary celibate people — but 
once the ?lm became available to a 
wider audience, it became apparent 
that this ?lm is not a promotion of 
incel ideology.
But where did this notion come 
from, and how does Joker really 
connect to our society? It isn’t 
dif?cult to see how this movie could 
be interpreted as incel-friendly. 
Arthur is a friendless young man 
with a mental illness who lives 
with his mother in his seemingly 
meaningless life. He meets a 
woman who lives down the hall, 
but his attraction towards her never 
leads to an intimate relationship. 
Identity crisis and a failed romance 
subplot alone don’t make someone 
an incel, though.
While Arthur does ?t most of 
the demographics of the present-
day incel community — almost 
entirely men under 30 years old — 
his worldview is distinct from that 
of incels. The “inceldom” is a subset 
of the manosphere. Members of the 
manosphere believe that only the 
most attractive and successful men 
attract women, and that men are 
either alpha Chads, forever alone, or 
“normie beta cucks.”
Going beyond the “red-pilling”, 
or entering the manosphere, incels 
can also consume the “black pill”. 
This is essentially misogyny-driven 
catastrophizing, where incels believe 
that immutable physical, mental, 
or social characteristics leave them 
with no hope at having a sexual 
relationship — and therefore no 
happiness. All they can do is “lie 
down and rot”. After watching Joker, 
I can con?dently state that this is 
not who the Joker is. While I haven’t 
been able to pin down what Arthur’s 
speci?c worldview and motives are, 
his anger and frustration were in no 
way directed towards women.
It’s concerning that people have 
taken Arthur and ?attened his 
entire character down to being a 
representative for a community in the 
dark corner of the internet. Arthur 
has serious problems in his life that 
he has little to no agency over.
He and his mother were abused 
while he was a child. The hysterical 
laughter caused by his mental 
condition makes his peers view 
him as a “freak.” He must care for 
his mother alone in a run-down 
apartment. He’s unable to receive 
adequate mental health services 
because of cuts to social programs. 
He is a product of the broken system 
he’s lived in, his behavior largely 
molded by external factors.
The reason, I believe, that early 
viewers were so quick to label the 
Joker as a hero for incels is that many 
people don’t actually understand 
who incels are or the process of 
falling into the vicious cycles that 
lead people to take the black pill. 
However, there also appears to be 
a wider misunderstanding of what 
leads individuals to adopt radical 
worldviews.
Too often, people will view 
extremists with disdain and dismiss 
them as simply vile people, rather 
than taking the time to understand 
that they’re vulnerable members of 
our society. They are people who have 
become susceptible to dangerous 
ideologies and have fallen through 
the cracks because of systemic socio-
economic failures. Arthur, the Joker, 
is one of these people.
What Joker can tell us is that 
it’s incumbent upon us to provide 
a support network for people in 
danger of falling into the same 
descent that Arthur does in this 
movie. Seeing it happen stretched 
out over a two-hour ?lm, Joaquin 
Phoenix’s portrayal of this 
complicated journey will make 
people uncomfortable and uneasy. 
That makes sense. It shouldn’t feel 
enjoyable or exhilarating watching 
someone’s life and mind fall apart, 
but this happens every day to 
members of our society who feel 
hopeless or punched down.
Over the course of the ?lm, 
Arthur repeatedly ?nds his life being 
chipped away or made worthless. 
He loses his job because a coworker 
throws him under the bus for having 
a weapon. The social worker he 
visits appears to offer little support 
for him and once that public service 
is defunded, he loses his access to 
psychiatric medications.
His trust in society is broken 
after what he experiences. He 
discovers from his mother the 
true identity of his father, but 
later is told that his mother had 
been placed in a mental hospital 
with delusions while Arthur was a 
young boy (in fact, he was actually 
adopted). After Arthur performs at 
a local comedy club, his hero, talk 
show host Murray Franklin, mocks 
him when clips of his set are shown 
on-air. He feels lied to by the only 
two people he’s placed trust in. At 
that point, for vulnerable people 
like Arthur, reality stops mattering.
In his journal, Arthur writes, 
“I hope my death will make more 
cents than my life.” This is what 
extremism can lead one to, a loss 
of meaning in one’s life that they 
(incorrectly) think only death could 
ful?ll. It’s what’s been happening 
to the people being radicalized on 
our always connected but socially 
isolating internet. Hopeless people, 
after facing repeated failure in their 
lives with no sense of improvement, 
seek explanations for their despair. 
For these people, often mentally ill or 
under severe social pressures, radical 
beliefs such as the ones offered by 
incels help them make sense of the 
world, while guiding them towards 
the nihilistic death cult black pilling 
leads to.
After mulling through all this, I 
found myself asking the question: 
How could we have stopped Arthur 
from becoming the Joker? While 
I still don’t have an exact answer, I 
do believe there are approaches we 
could use to prevent people from 
going down the path of extremism 
that Arthur went down. It’s clear that 
isolation is unhealthy for everyone. 
Lost in a void without meaningful 
connections, the emotional wear this 
would have on someone transcends 
material status, but especially for 
people under powerful economic 
and professional stress.
We need to do more to ensure 
that people have adequate support 
systems to help keep them from 
drifting off into radicalizing internet 
forums. We can establish better 
mental health infrastructure for this 
and perhaps promote more social 
interaction for those on the fringes.
Using incels as an example, 
we can create positive support 
groups and teach social skills to 
help would-be incels form positive 
friendships (and potentially, 
romantic relationships) rather 
than feel driven to form viciously 
unhealthy relationships with 
members of the incel community. 
There’s something deeper, though, 
about our society’s interpersonal 
culture and how we humanize — or 
dehumanize — others. Somehow, 
this needs to be shifted in order 
for us to address the Joker’s type 
of nihilistic attitude towards 
people and institutions that have 
permeated throughout radicalizers.
Arthur wants to be treated 
with decency and wants to live 
a respectful life, but when he is 
essentially pushed out of society and 
has his identity wiped, he becomes 
the Joker, similar to how vulnerable 
people can become incels. Once it 
feels like all you can do is “lie down 
and rot”, violent revenge on those 
who wronged you seems much 
more appealing.
We live in a society. No one should 
have to live through it as Arthur does.

Global and U.S. greenhouse 
gas emissions increased again 
in 2018. Climate change is far 
from a won battle. Innovations in 
energy technology are required to 
slow the world’s approach to the 
precipice of climate catastrophe.
On Tuesday, Sept. 17, the Scott 
Institute for Energy Innovation 
featured Professor of the Practice 
and Energy Futures Initiative 
Principal Joseph Hezir, for a 
lecture on the novel ?eld of 
carbon sequestration. Carbon 
Dioxide Removal (CDR) is the 
process of removing CO2 from 
the atmosphere or oceans and 
storing it in soil, plant matter, and 
minerals.
In its current state, a large 
CDR effort is the only way for the 
world to prevent a 2°C average 
temperature increase. As carbon 
emission is reduced and hopefully 
eliminated, climate change will 
still only get worse. Dangerous 
points of no return have already 
been passed according to climate 
scientists from around the globe 
— a paper from 2007 describes the 
earth’s permafrost as containing 
about 25-50 percent of the total 
quantity of soil organic carbon, 
atmospheric carbon stored in soil.
Some permafrost has been 
storing the same carbon for 
millennia, resilient to the natural 
heat cycles of the earth. As the 
permafrost is now heated, this 
carbon, in the form of CO2 or 
methane, is released into the 
atmosphere. Thermokarst, or 
abrupt thaws, are when ground 
ice melts and deep, old permafrost 
pockets are exposed, releasing 
huge amounts of carbon. These 
irregular surfaces of land reach 
deep into the ancient permafrost, 
belching massive amounts of 
locked CO2 into the atmosphere. 
The released carbon then heats 
the earth through the greenhouse 
gas effect, which further heats 
the permafrost, creating a 
positive feedback cycle that will 
unlock enough carbon for the 
permafrost to continue melting 
catastrophically. It is estimated 
that 200 billion tons of carbon 
will be released by the thawing 
of permafrost over the next 
few centuries — that’s about 
15 percent of the total carbon 
emitted by industrialization.
Other positive feedback 
systems include deserti?cation, 
rainforest decay, peat decomposi-
tion, and forest ?res. Along with 
our past emissions, these loops 
will continue to heat the planet 
even while industrial emissions 
are reduced and eliminated. 
A goal of net zero emissions 
is insuf?cient to address the 
issue of past emissions, which 
have set in motion what is 
essentially a boulder rolling 
down a hill, increasing in speed 
uncontrollably. There is no 
chance for an unaided return to 
pre-industrial climate in the next 
century. Even if we reduced new 
emissions to zero, the old emitted 
carbon will linger in the air for 
another millennium, heating the 
planet like an oven.
Our only chance seems 
to be the removal of carbon 
from the atmosphere, CDR. 
Our lingering past emissions 
pose just as existential a threat 
to civilization as our current 
emissions. CDR is one of the few 
existing technological methods 
for combating past emissions.
In the lecture, Hezir introduced 
a proposal for the creation of a 
comprehensive three-part, ten-
year R&D initiative involving 12 
government agencies, with a total 
funding of $10.7 billion.
Capture technology includes 
direct air capture, terrestrial 
and biological storage, carbon 
mineralization, and coastal and 
ocean storage. CO2 disposition 
involves geological sequestration 
and CO2 utilization. Cross-
cutting is the multidisciplinary 
side of the initiative, focusing on 
data collection, research into the 
economics of carbon, and public 
opinion.
The scale of the global CDR 
program must be 10 gigatons

Magnetic skin and robot soft sensing
FRANK HU
Operations Manager
The largest human organ is 
not the lungs or the stomach, 
but the skin. Protecting our 
sensitive internal workings from 
the elements, our skin serves 
an important purpose as both a 
barrier and a vehicle for sensory 
stimulation, without which we 
would be literal piles of ?esh.
Unlike humans, robots can 
get along without any soft outer 
covering. Their metallic exteriors 
protect their sensitive electronics 
and their sense data, delivered 
via intricate arrays of sensors 
and circuits. But just because 
something works doesn’t mean 
it can’t be improved. Once again, 
Carnegie Mellon researchers 
have advanced the ?eld of 
robotics by giving robots soft 
sensing through an outer layer of 
magnetic skin.
Conventional methods of 
detecting tactile sensations 
require a single wire connected 
to every contact point. “The wires 
might be ?ne inside hard cases 
such as smartphones and other 
devices, but if you’re talking 
about fabric-skin or something 
else that’s soft — then suddenly 
all those wires become sources 
of failure,” explained Carmel 
Majidi, Associate Professor of 
Mechanical Engineering, in a 
university press release.
To solve this problem, Majidi 
and his colleagues at the Soft 
Machines Lab developed a silicon 
rubber skin that relies on magnetic 
?eld disturbances inside the skin 
when it touches another object. 
These disturbances are detected 
by a magnetometer, which then 
relays the information to central 
processing. The data can be used 
to infer the location and pressure 
of contact with the skin.
With this more streamlined 
method for detection of tactile 
sensations, the researchers 
were able to create “soft” robots 
that are more ef?cient and less 
prone to electrical or mechanical 
failures. This makes it possible 
for soft robots to more effectively 
ful?ll their roles in sensitive 
industries, such as healthcare 
and assisted living for elderly or 
physically frail individuals. These 
are only two of the potential 
applications for this magnetic 
skin and the soft robots that 
it will cover, technology that 
could lead to exciting new robot 
designs that appear more science 
?ction than reality.
The magnetic skin is still 
in development, with the 
researchers experimenting 
on creating larger magnetic 
microparticles or placing the 
magnetometer in different 
locations to increase the 
magnetic ?eld and sensitivity. 
If the magnetic skin becomes 
widely integrated, it could 
revolutionize soft robotics and 
soft sensing by broadening 
the limits of robot design, but 
also change our stereotypes of 
robots from hard, stainless steel 
automatons to machines that are 
capable of feeling similarly to us.
Another day, another step 
closer to the singularity.

CARBON, from A7
of CO2 per year by 2050 and 20 
gigatons of CO2 per year by 2100 
in order to reverse the massive 
amount of anthropogenic 
emissions. To put these numbers 
into context, one gigaton of CO2 
was emitted by the entire U.S. 
light-duty vehicle ?eet of 250 
million vehicles in 2017. To have 
a signi?cant impact on climate 
change, the CDR initiative must 
develop an industry on the scale 
of the U.S. steel sector.
For such an industry to be 
effective, the ten-year research 
initiative must reduce the cost 
of every type of carbon capture 
method and lay the groundwork 
for massive investment.
In a recently published 
paper, scientists from the 
Harvard School of Engineer-
ing and Applied Sciences and 
from the ?rm Carbon Engineer-
ing detailed engineering and 
cost analysis for a 1 Mt-CO2/
year direct air capture plant. 
This plant would have a level-
ized cost of $94 to $232 per ton 
CO2 from the atmosphere. “This 
design re?ects roughly 100 per-
son-years of development by 
Carbon Engineering,” stated the 
paper.
This process is facilitated 
by four major components, the 
contactor, the pellet reactor, 
the calciner, and the slaker. 
First, the contactor brings ambi-
ent air and an alkaline solution 
together, effectively “trapping” 
the ambient carbon in potassium 
carbonate. Next, the pellet 
reactor adds calcium ions into 
the carbon saturated solution, 
causing the precipitation of 
CaCO3 or calcite. Water is also 
removed in this step. Then, 
these calcite pellets are heated, 
yielding calcium oxide, and the 
pure CO2 now removed from 
the air, can be compressed, 
sequestered, and used in 
industry. Finally, heat from the 
slaker is used to dry and preheat 
the pellets, yielding suf?cient 
steam to further the reaction.
But other carbon capture 
methods are equally important. 
The U.S. government’s 
Advanced Research Projects 
Agency has been developing 
a new technology which 
enhances the roots of wetland 
plants to store carbon in a more 
resilient fashion. Wetlands can 
be expanded into low vegeta-
tion lowlands, and reforestation 
can store carbon in massive 
amounts. Ocean algae remove 
massive amounts of carbon from 
the air but are threatened by 
ocean acidi?cation. Carbon can 
be mineralized into solids and 
stored underground, but today 
the cost of these methods are 
too high to be implemented on a 
signi?cant scale.
Carbon taxes are a sure?re 
way to reduce emissions 
to required levels. An 
implementation that allocates 
the collected funds into research 
and production of new energy 
production systems. However, 
carbon taxes are politically unvi-
able in today’s political climate.
Hezir had a message for 
young engineers, champing 
at the bit to create impactful 
innovations. The techniques 
outlined will decrease the cost 
of carbon sequestration, he said, 
but we need real breakthroughs 
in creating processes which 
ef?ciently convert forms of 
carbon into materials, energy, 
and production.
Spread of seizures can be suppressed
SEAN MIN
Staffwriter
Suf?cient pressure inside the brain 
could prevent seizures from spreading 
throughout the brain, Carnegie Mellon 
researchers have found. This discovery 
has the potential to completely alter 
how drug-resistant epilepsy is treated.
Epilepsy is among the most common 
neurological disorders, affecting young 
and old people alike. Many seizure 
disorders exist, but all are considered 
forms of epilepsy. Although the major-
ity of seizure disorders can be treated 
with medicine, a few strains of epilepsy 
are drug-resistant. These strains of epi-
lepsy can only be treated with surgery, 
where surgeons remove tissue to elimi-
nate or minimize seizures
Dr. Bin He, the Department Head 
of Biomedical Engineering, and his 
lab recently published a study in the 
Annals of Neurology journal alongside 
researchers from the Mayo Clinic. The 
study, “Multiple Oscillatory Push-
Pull Antagonisms Constrain Seizure 
Propagation”, describes what may be an 
important and promising biomarker in 
the future, ?nding that focal seizures — 
seizures which arise from a single point 
— are able to be regulated by the brain’s 
push-pull dynamics.
According to the researchers, an 
imbalance of excitation-inhibition 
activity in epileptic networks may 
allow for the secondary generalization 
of focal seizures. These researchers 
speculate that medical professionals 
could determine whether a seizure 
will propagate throughout the brain 
by looking at imbalances between 
inhibition and excitation of ?ring of 
neurons.
“People thought that the spread 
of seizures mainly depends on where 
seizures originate in the brain, but 
the propagation of a seizure is ac-
tually regulated by the surround-
ing tissues, which includes that sei-
zure onset zone. By using an array of 
electrophysiological recordings, we 
found that it’s not moving outward nec-
essarily; it depends on how much ‘pull’ 
a patient receives from the surrounding 
tissue towards the seizure onset zone, 
and how much ‘push’ propagates from 
the seizure onset zone in the same pa-
tient. If that pull is weak, then it’s going 
to spread. If that pull is strong, then we 
can contain the seizure where it is and 
prevent it from spreading,” said He in a 
press release.
Currently, medical professionals 
are aware that drug-resistant focal 
epilepsy is a network disease, where 
seizures originate at a single point 
then propagate throughout the entire 
brain, spreading alongside differing 
neuron oscillation frequencies. Howev-
er, the exact manner in which different 
networks lead to the spreading of focal 
seizures remains a mystery.
The researchers contrasted fast 
and slow brain rhythms, as well as 
many frequencies of brain activity. 
They analyzed the rhythmic bands 
of functional networks, performing 
analyses of how low and high brain 
rhythms interact. They used a recently 
popularized technique known as cross-
frequency directionality to analyze 24 
focal drug-resistant epilepsy patients. 
In doing so, they discovered that 
propagation of seizures in the brain 
is dependent on a so-called push-
pull antagonism control mechanism, 
which may indicate connections in the 
epileptic network and may also sup-
press the seizures.
He explained, “This ?nding will have 
important implications, and suggests 
that future treatment options should 
consider interventions not only upon 
seizure onset zones, but also the sur-
rounding tissues. Further delineation 
of critical network nodes may assist the 
development of treatments for epilepsy 
using neuromodulation.”
“People thought that the spread of seizures 
mainly depends on where [they] originate.”

IAAF Championships start with a heartwarming ?nish
CYNTHIA XU
Staffwriter
The 2019 IAAF World Athletics 
Championships was held last week 
in Doha, Qatar, and saw an array 
of amazing displays of athleticism. 
There were ?rst-time gold 
medalists, championship records, 
and world records, but perhaps the 
most impactful and memorable 
moment of the entire competition 
came on the very ?rst day during 
the 5000 meter run.
The ?rst heat of the men’s 5000 
meters got off to a fast start, with 
Julien Wanders of Switzerland 
leading after the ?rst thousand 
meters with a split of 2:48.83. The 
next lap saw Oscar Chelimo of 
Uganda move to the forefront of 
the pack, splitting 5:36.22 at the 
2000 meter mark.
The pre-race favorites began 
to get move ahead within the 
group, with the likes of Ethiopians 
Selemon Barega and Muktar Edris, 
along with Kenyan Jacob Krop, the 
latter setting the pace for the next 
two laps with splits of 8:17.59 and 
10:56.52.
A powerful kick in the last 
100 meters of the race allowed 
Selemon Barega to overtake Jacob 
Krop, qualifying for the ?nal in 
?rst place with a time of 13:24.69. 
Krop, along with Barenga’s fellow 
countryman Muktar Edris, also 
quali?ed, as did Pan American 
champion Mohammad Ahmed 
of Canada. (Edris would go on to 
win the ?nals of the 5000 meters, 
with Barenga placing second and 
Ahmed in third.)
Although the main pack of 
runners had completed the race, 
a few athletes who had been 
left behind by the grueling pace 
continued to race. Among these 
were Jonathan Busby of Aruba and 
Braima Suncar Dabó of Guinea-
Bissau. Both were the only athlete 
representing their countries at the 
Championships.
With most of the remaining 
runners ?nishing sporadically in 
the minute that followed, Busby 
and Dabó became the only ones 
remaining on the track.
Busby was on his last lap, but 
was clearly exhausted. 300 meters 
from the ?nish line, fatigue forced 
him to slow his pace down to a 
near-stop. The crowd seemed 
apprehensive, and for an anxious 
moment, it appeared as if Busby 
was not going to be able to ?nish the 
race. However, fervent cheering 
broke out as Braima Suncar Dabó 
came to his opponent’s aid.
Grasping Busby’s arm, Dabó 
led him through 150 meters before 
taking Busby’s arm and draping it 
around his neck, further supporting 
him to ?nish the last 150 meters of 
the race. As the crowd rose to their 
feet in approval and applause, the 
two athletes crossed the ?nish 
line side-by-side. Although it had 
been nearly ?ve minutes since the 
main pack of athletes had ?nished, 
the spectators showed the same 
ovation it had given to the victor, if 
not greater.
Though neither spoke the 
other’s language, Busby made 
his thanks obvious, and Dabó 
continued to monitor Busby’s 
condition until the designated 
medical personnel took over. 
When later interviewed by Reuters 
about his determination to help 
his fellow competitor, Dabó stated 
that, “My thoughts were to help 
him ?nish, that is the point of the 
race.”
Although he had run the 
distance faster in the past, the 
International Association of 
Athletics Federations recorded 
Dabó’s ?nal time in the men’s 
5000 meter run as a personal best, 
perhaps in a show of solidarity.
In an increasingly more 
competitive sporting environment 
that often approaches the degree 
of cutthroat, it is frankly refreshing 
and inspiring to witness such a 
display of sportsmanship — to see 
an athlete helping their competitor 
on such a grand stage for no other 
reason than deciding that it was 
the right thing to do. It is this kind 
of action that encourages other 
athletes to follow suit, taking more 
care in and paying more detailed 
attention to the way in which they 
treat their opponents.
Braima Suncar Dabó may not 
have won any accolades in the form 
of medals, but his demonstration 
of compassion and championship 
spirit has undoubtedly won him 
the respect and reverence of the 
global sporting community.
Tottenham takes a big loss in the UCL
California’s SB 206 is passed: NCAA prepares for revenue loss
RUEL BERESFORD
Junior Staffwriter
Governor Gavin Newsom of 
California has passed what may 
probably go down as the most 
substantive piece of legislation 
in sports history, since the 
courts ruled on the side of Oscar 
Roberston when he sued the NBA 
in 1970. That case, which allowed 
for larger contracts via free 
agency’s implementation in the 
NBA, completely transformed the 
league, sending it into a new era.
Similarly, the NCAA has now 
approached its own fork in the 
road, where any decision the 
organization makes will change 
its future course. The NCAA is at 
a turning point, but importantly, 
so too are the athletes. Whatever 
comes in the next few years as a 
result of this decision will be a 
re?ection of how we value college 
athletics.
For the NCAA, this legislation 
could possibly not come at a worse 
time, with a recession looming and 
a movement behind the students. 
California is one of the few states 
that they cannot afford to lose, as 
the universities in the UCal and 
Cal State system, plus private 
institutions like Stanford and USC, 
are responsible for millions of 
dollars in revenue for the NCAA. 
With bills nearly identical to 
California’s being brought up in 
states like New York and Florida, 
the NCAA must reckon with the 
risk of the revenue loss escalating 
out of control. The NCAA has been 
given four years by California to 
either synthesize or antagonize 
California’s policies within their 
own policies, but if other states 
join California, then it is doubtful 
that they will have that much time. 
The NCAA must adapt to develop 
new revenue streams.
Meanwhile, for the athletes, 
they now enter a world in which 
there is, for some of them, in?nite 
possibility. A ?ve-star recruit 
going to UCLA will be able to 
leverage their talent, if they play 
football or basketball, to make 
what could amount to millions of 
dollars before they even enter a 
professional league. This would 
be great for them, but for other 
athletes who are either not as 
well regarded in a major sport, or 
participants in a sport that does 
not have national popularity (say, 
water polo) this will have a more 
muted effect. For some, they may 
be able to leverage their talents 
to set up a pro?table YouTube 
channel, or serve as high school 
coaches. And for others, nothing 
may happen. College students are 
now entering into an unregulated 
market where they are able to 
hire agents, but now risk hiring an 
unscrupulous agent, and may end 
up indebted and worse off than 
they were before.
More likely than not, it will be 
a net gain for the athletes. It will 
allow them to learn and apply 
business techniques to their brand, 
and they may be forced to learn 
key money management skills 
that are transferable to any walk 
of life. The protections provided to 
the students massively outweigh 
the revenue lost by the NCAA, 
but now that the students will be 
able to monetize their brand, the 
repercussions on student life will 
be determined along the way.
run by Gnabry in the 53rd min-
ute topped with an equally 
impressive ?nish saw the visitors 
double their lead. Scarcely two 
minutes later, a mistake by Harry 
Winks let Tolisso feed the ball 
to an ever-ready Gnabry, whose 
well-aimed shot found the back 
of the net off the post, bringing 
the scoreline to 4-1 in favor of 
Bayern.
A clash in the 59th min-
ute between Danny Rose and 
Kingsley Coman just inside the 
18-yard box was ruled a high 
boot on the part of Coman, and 
a coolly taken penalty by Kane 
seemed to give the hosts a chance 
at a comeback. However, Bayern 
continued to hold fast, prevent-
ing Spurs from posing a serious 
threat to their goal.
The ?nal ten minutes of the 
game saw a Bayern onslaught. 
It began with a 40-yard pass 
by Thiago in the 83rd minute 
that allowed Serge Gnabry 
to run behind the Tottenham 
line of defense, completing his 
hat-trick. Then, in the 87th 
minute, Alderweireld’s pass 
was intercepted by Thiago, and 
Lewandowski slipped behind his 
marker to score a brace.
It didn’t stop there, though, 
and a mistake by Aurier in the 
88th minute meant that it took 
barely another minute for Gnabry 
to ?nd the back of the net a fourth 
time, making the ?nal scoreline 
an astonishing 7 goals for the 
visitors versus 2 for the hosts.
This loss means that 
Tottenham Hotspur are now 
bottom of the Group B table, 
with only one win in their last 5 
games. The severity of this defeat 
also raises questions regarding 
manager Mauricio Pochettino’s 
tenure at the club, along with the 
status of the team as a whole.
A triumphant Bayern Munich 
now tops the Group B table, 
looking poised to take a spot 
in the Round of 16, and from 
Serge Gnabry’s remarkable 
performance, it seems certain 
that the future of the club is in 
good hands.

Heartbreaking 2OT loss for CMU football at Grove City
MARIKA YANG
Publisher
The Carnegie Mellon University 
football team fell 29–26 to the 
Grove City College Wolverines 
on Saturday in a double overtime 
heartbreaker. The loss was the 
Tartans’ ?rst of the season, 
bringing their overall record to 
4–1, and 3–1 in Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference play.
Junior quarterback JD 
Dayhuff threw for 166 yards 
with three touchdowns and two 
interceptions. Senior running back 
Chris Haas led the team in rushing 
with 119 yards on 27 carries. Two 
of Dayhuff’s touchdowns went 
to sophomore wide receiver Kris 
Hughes, who ?nished with 36 total 
yards. Despite a thrilling ?nish, 
much of the story of the game was 
the Tartans’ kicking woes.
The ?rst quarter was a 
defensive battle. The ?rst points 
came with 1:07 left in the quarter 
on a 22-yard Dayhuff-to-Hughes 
connection. Sophomore kicker 
Brandon Nguyen missed the extra 
point, keeping the score 6–0. In 
the second quarter, the Wolverines 
got on the board with a ?eld goal, 
but most of the drives on both 
sides stalled, ending in punts or 
interceptions.
The offense on both sides 
began to heat up in the second 
half. The Wolverines evened the 
score to 6–6 with another ?eld 
goal midway through the third 
quarter. On the following drive, 
the Tartans marched down the 
?eld, aided by a 35-yard kickoff 
return by junior running back 
Sean Cooke. Nguyen’s 44-yard 
?eld goal attempt missed wide left, 
and the score remained tied. The 
Wolverines took over from their 
27-yard line and promptly scored 
on a 71-yard pass for a touchdown, 
making the score 13–6 for Grove 
City’s ?rst lead of the day.
The Tartans responded at the 
beginning of the fourth quarter 
with the second Dayhuff-to-
Hughes score of the day, a 9-yard 
touchdown pass. However, the 
Wolverines blocked Nguyen’s 
extra point, keeping the score 
13–12. The Wolverines took their 
largest lead of the game, 20–12, 
with a touchdown run with 11:58 
left to play. Later in the quarter, 
Dayhuff found junior tight end 
Kerry Tomasetti for a 20-yard 
touchdown. After a day of special 
teams issues, the Tartans elected 
to go for the two-point conversion. 
Dayhuff went to his favorite target, 
Hughes, to tie the game, 20–20.
Then came overtime. The 
Tartans won the toss and elected 
to begin on defense. After a 
Wolverines ?eld goal, the Tartans 
had to tie the game with a ?eld goal 
to force a second overtime or score 
a touchdown to win. Junior kicker 
and punter Josh Lyons kicked a 
42-yarder, the ?rst of his career. In 
the second overtime, the Tartans 
offense took possession ?rst, and 
Lyons hit another ?eld goal, this 
time for 23 yards. The ball went to 
the Wolverines, and quarterback 
Josh Ehst ran in the ball from the 
1-yard line for the touchdown and 
the win.
Despite ?nishing with more ?rst 
downs, time of procession, and a 
higher third-down conversion rate, 
the Tartans suffered from their 
uneven special teams play, costing 
them several points in regulation.
Next week, the Tartans will 
return to Pittsburgh for just their 
second home game of the season. 
They will welcome the Waynesburg 
University Yellow Jackets at 7 p.m. 
at Gesling Stadium.

Penalty shouts: On the NCAA’s evil lair
Tottenham destroyed at home by Bayern on day two of UCL

This is Penalty Shouts, The 
Tartan’s sports column inspired 
by the The New Yorker’s column 
Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled 
column will focus on anything 
and everything funny in the sports 
world that is deserving of our 
comedic attention. 
After California governor 
Gavin Newsom signed a bill 
granting NCAA players rights 
to their likeness into law, the 
NCAA board room went into 
lockdown. Their of?ce inside the 
peak of Mt. St. Helens had sirens 
blaring as windows and doors 
were sealed by blast proof metal. 
Fortunately, I was able to take 
the SLICE van, equipped with ten 
million horsepower and a light 
machine gun, to Washington 
before the doors sealed for good. 
But it was a close call as I coolly 
slid underneath the blast shield, 
almost losing my trademark hat 
and whip in the process. The 
Tartan had exclusive access.
Inside their boardroom, there 
was a long, oval table with suits 
seated around the perimeter. The 
biggest and fattest sat at the head, 
opposite of the in-wall television 
screen projecting a PowerPoint 
slide that read, “OK. The 
Apocalypse is here. Now what?”
The unfortunate sap presenting 
on what exactly the NCAA should 
do next was dropped through a 
trapdoor after he tried to explain 
that the NCAA could work with 
the players and still generate 
enough revenue to survive if 
they trimmed administrative 
fat. Another person, rather 
reminiscent of a mouse crossed a 
stick bug, walked in to ?nish the 
presentation: “The NCAA can 
survive. We need to lawyer up, hit 
the gyms (with taxes), and delete 
Facebook.” He has a point about 
Facebook. But the others? Trying 
to defeat a law that protects 18-23 
year olds in court seems like an 
outright evil thing to do.
Then again, what organization 
has a secret headquarters inside 
of a volcano with blast shields 
protecting doors and windows 
and preventing escape? To 
name a few: Syndrome from The 
Incredibles, Dr. Evil from Austin 
Powers, The Grinch, and whoever 
that villain is in Spy Kids 2: Island 
of Lost Dreams. And now, the 
NCAA. If you’re associated with a 
person who has evil in their name, 
bro wyd?
After listening for a little 
longer to the suits drone on 
about generating revenue and 
revolutionizing the economy, I 
decided I had enough. The only 
way out was through a giant hole 
in the middle of the volcano, so 
I parachuted down for what felt 
like forever, feeling vaguely like 
Juni Cortez in Spy Kids 2, until I 
hit bottom. I walked out the front 
door, leaving the suits behind.

The second matchday of the 
European Champions League 
group stage saw several notable 
matches. Among these was 
the game between English side 
Tottenham Hotspur, the runner-
ups from the previous season, and 
German giants Bayern Munich.
Although Tottenham had done 
well in the 2018-19 Champions 
League season, the 2019-20 
season was not going smoothly, 
with Spurs botching a 2-goal 
lead to tie Olympiakos on the ?rst 
matchday. In contrast, Bayern had 
won their game that day, and were 
sitting at the top of the Bundesliga 
table. Nevertheless, the ?eld was 
open for either team to snatch up 
all 3 points.
Having beaten Bayern in the 
summer Audi Cup on penalties, 
Tottenham hoped to replicate 
the quality of that performance 
against the clearly better side. And 
since the game was being played 
in North London, it was expected 
that the pitch and the crowd 
would grant Spurs a signi?cant 
home ?eld advantage.
Kickoff began with both teams 
looking eager to score. Bayern’s 
?rst shot on target came in the 2nd 
minute of the game, with Kingsley 
Coman picking out Serge Gnabry’s 
run forward, necessitating a solid 
save from Spurs keeper Hugo 
Lloris. Tottenham continued 
to press deep, with shots from 
Heung-min Son in the 6th and 
10th minutes, forcing saves from 
Manuel Neuer. Another chance 
for Bayern early in the game fell 
to Robert Lewandowski, but the 
effort failed to trouble Lloris.
After a bad mistake from Bayern 
defender Corentin Tolisso just 
outside the Bayern box, the ball 
found its way to Moussa Sissoko, 
whose well-timed pass to Son 
saw a precise ?nish that allowed 
Tottenham to take an early lead 
in the 12th minute. The 1-0 score-
line wouldn’t last for long, though, 
as an incomplete clearance by 
Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen fell 
to Joshua Kimmich, who curled his 
shot into the back of the net from 
20 yards out, leveling the score.
However, Spurs continued 
to press forward. An effort from 
Harry Kane in the 18th minute 
caught Neuer in no-man’s-land, 
but was cleared by David Alaba. 
More shots came from Serge 
Aurier, Son, and Kane, but were all 
either just wide or saved by Neuer. 
In the 45th minute, a scramble in 
the Tottenham box ended with 
the ball falling to an unmarked 
Lewandowski, who whipped the 
ball just past the reach of Lloris 
to give Bayern a 1-2 lead heading 
into half-time.
The second half seemed to start 
well for Tottenham, with an effort 
from Dele Ali in the 50th minute 
testing Neuer. However, Bayern 
fought back. A fantastic 40-yard

This weekend, the lastest installment in the Toy Story franchise 
will be playing at McConomy. The movie is another sweet, 
funny, warm, and oddly sad addition to the franchise. It’s 
surprising that the fourth movie in a Disney franchise is even 
as good as it is. The animation is unparalleled, and Pixar 
has outdone themselves again. The visual gags are great as 
always. The characters are well written, including the spork 
character, which I didn’t expect. The humor is great, and the 
film doesn’t entirely play it safe, which is a rarity for Pixar 
at this stage of their existence. Check this one out with your 
family this weekend and have a good time!

Senyai Thai Kitchen — Shadyside
With several menu choices from noodles, curry, and stir-
fried dishes, Senyai is one of my favorite restaurants in 
all of Pittsburgh. Located on the first floor of a converted 
house on Ellsworth Avenue, it’s cute with a fun vibe and 
relaxed feel. I recommend anything from the Chef’s 
Special — I loved the Pad Medmamuang: crispy chicken, 
cashews, and mixed vegetables tossed in chili sauce.
Tip: go on a nice day and sit on the back patio. As the 
night gets dark, the colorful lights around the patio will 
light up your table.

Thai Noodle Outlet — Squirrel Hill
A small place next to the Carnegie Library at the Forbes 
and Murray intersection, Thai Noodle Outlet is a great 
option if you’re craving Thai takeout or something casual 
to sit in with friends. The Pad Thai, which I regularly 
order from different Thai places, was great, with the 
right dash of peanut flavor.
Tip: check out the lunch special.

Spice Island Tea House — Oakland
One of the classic staples of my college years, Spice 
Island doesn’t just offer Thai but a mix of Malaysian, 
Burmese, Indonesian, and Singaporean dishes. The first 
thing I ever tried there was the Burmese BBQ chicken 
thighs in yogurt-curry marinade, which is always a great 
choice, but I also recommend the Singapore Char Kway 
Teow: wide rice noodles with shrimp, Chinese sausage, 
bean sprouts, and spicy sweet soy sauce.
Tip: try the extensive selection of teas.
Thai Me Up — South Side
Shopping at South Side Works and hungry for Thai 
food? Try Thai Me Up, a romantic restaurant a couple 
blocks off E. Carson St. With a wooden rustic aesthetic 
with fun art design and bright light streaming from the 
tall windows, enjoy lots of classic and modern choices on 
the menu. With many entrees, pho, and curry, you could 
have a party of ten and everyone could order something 
different.
Tip: spice up your usual Pad Thai order with Pad Thai 
Mung Bean noodles, which have the classic taste of Pad 
Thai paired with the stringy glass noodles.
Nicky’s Thai Kitchen — Downtown
A busy place in the middle of Downtown, Nicky’s Thai 
Kitchen can get pretty crowded during the dinner rush 
with people getting off of work, but the wait is worth it. 
With traditional and colorful décor, relax with a large 
pot of chicken curry.
Tip: try the second location on the North Shore.

KIRK
J
onathan Lyndale Kirk, known by 
stage name DaBaby, stepped into 
the mainstream scene with his first 
standalone project, Baby on Baby, 
which released Mar. 1, 2019. The lead 
single “Suge” on the album made its way 
to number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, 
essentially shooting DaBaby onto center 
stage. Since then, he has accumulated 
numerous features on the tracks of other 
up-and-coming artists like Megan Thee 
Stallion and Lil Nas X.
So what sets his new album apart from 
the rest of his discography? Mainly, it is 
DaBaby’s unwavering allegiance to family. 
The title of his new album, KIRK, is a tribute 
to his last name, his family name. With 
the title and album artwork — a picture of 
him with his father — DaBaby is letting us 
know what one thing holds this piece of 
work together: family. DaBaby begins the 
“INTRO” with a tribute, “Thinkin’ ‘bout my 
grandmama and s*** / … thinkin’ ‘bout 
my father and s*** / They found him dead 
a couple days before I started tour / … I 
was out there with the family / Just lookin’ 
at my daughter / Thinkin’ to myself like, 
‘Damn, my baby look just like my daddy.’” 
With these opening lines, we know that 
KIRK isn’t just the title of his album; it’s 
the last name of his father, his mother, his 
grandmother, and his daughter. It is the 
name that connects all of them and it is a 
tribute to his family. Throughout the next 
twelve electrifyingly playful and intensely 
moving tracks, the audience is transported 
into the life of DaBaby. Not only is the 
album full of tributes to his family, but it’s 
also full of tributes to himself.
So what makes DaBaby special? As Brian 
Josephs describes it in a Billboard article, it 
is “the unforced confidence that surrounds

him.” This “unforced confidence” is 
extremely palpable on tracks like “OFF THE 
RIP,” “BOP,” and “VIBEZ” in a way that it 
hasn’t been before. These tracks showcase 
that DaBaby knows he is ‘it’. He knows 
what he’s got, and he’s not afraid to flaunt 
it. On the first verse in “OFF THE RIP,” 
DaBaby shows us that he knows who he 
is, “I’m just a lil’ n**** from Charlotte, the 
biggest new artist.” DaBaby is not mincing 
his words. He knows who he is, and he is 
unafraid to showcase his talent. In “BOP,” 
DaBaby flexes his work ethic with the line, 
“I got me a milli’, I did it legit-ly” and on 
“VIBEZ,” he flaunts his lavish lifestyle with 
the lines, “I’m ‘bout to go buy me a coupe / 
Pull up, make the doors raise the roof.” Not 
only do these songs present as a tribute to 
DaBaby himself, but they also show a more 
playful side to the rapper.
Ahead of the release of KIRK, DaBaby 
told Apple Music, “I’m not too serious for 
myself.” This attitude can be seen clearly 
through most of the songs on the album. 
On POP STAR, a song about DaBaby’s 
success, he makes it clear through the lines, 
“They prolly tell you I went pop. Until a 
n**** play with me and he get popped.” 
Although he is playful, he is not to be 
played with. In the interlude of OFF THE 
RIP, DaBaby notes, “you know I just be 
playin’ sometimes,” and this lighthearted 
side of the rapper can be heard throughout 
the sometimes cheerful, melodic flute that 
often accompanies his verses. A reminder 
that while he may be rapping about his 
success, his physical altercations, his family, 
or God, he’s still not taking himself too 
seriously, and that the carefree side of 
DaBaby is always present if you’re willing to 
listen closely enough.

JOE’S
39 states. 296 performances. Immensely 
talented musician Joe Goodkin brought his 
version of The Odyssey to life in 2002, and 
has since performed his rendition of Homer’s 
classic all around the United States. Carnegie 
Mellon University invited Mr. Goodkin to 
perform last Monday, Sept. 30, through the 
efforts of Laura Donaldson, assistant director 
of undergraduate programs for the English 
department, and Ph.D. student Avery Wiscomb, 
who teaches the course “Books You Should 
Have Read by Now.”
Goodkin’s 30-minute performance of The 
Odyssey is entirely written by himself, and is 
performed with only an acoustic guitar and 
Goodkin’s voice. Goodkin’s Odyssey illustrates 
Odysseus’s emotional journey as he makes his 
way back home to Ithaca, ten years after the 
end of the Trojan War. Goodkin himself is a 
trained classicist, hailing from the University of 
Wisconsin, and has studied various translations 
of The Odyssey, as well as the original text 
itself. Thus he made conscious and deliberate 
decisions when composing his songs, which led 
to the creation of what he calls “Joe’s Odyssey.”
After his performance, there was a ten-minute 
Q&A in which Goodkin explained many of his 
deliberate decisions. I also had the fortune of 
having Mr. Goodkin visit my class the next day. 
Written below are a few of his responses to 
some questions raised during the performance 
and classroom Q&A.
Q
Did you find there was a tradeoff between 
the visual components [that are from the 
descriptive narrative] to create these songs?
There are always tradeoffs between an older 
idiom and a newer idiom. Every time you 
translate something, you lose something, 
no matter what. Even with Homer’s original 
text, he translated an oral performance. 
Embrace this [idea] early on and think of 
what strengths you can bring to it… classical 
languages have a beauty English cannot 
replicate and I fully accept that. But can 
I create an emotional performance that 
audiences can resonant with? Absolutely.A
Q
Why did you decide to write in first-person 
perspective?
When I first set out to write this, I did not 
know what it would be. But a few songs in, 
I realized I was extracting emotions that 
lay just below the surface and first person 
perspective was my way of showing that.A

---------------------------------------------------

11
written by Natalie Hon | Junior Staffwriter
art by Anna Boyle | Visual Editor
layout by Sahaana Sethu | Junior Layout Designer
Goodkin drew 
inspiration for his 
own translation through a 
variety of factors. One is the idea of the very 
first performance, before The Odyssey was 
even transcribed onto paper by Homer. In 
the days of Ancient Greece, all stories were 
oral performance and there was a sense of 
fleeting emotions. Goodkin stated, “When we 
listen to a story told in a group, we not only 
have our own reactions to the story, but we 
perceive the reaction of the group as well.” 
Thus, Goodkin’s performance, which is often 
done in front of large crowds of students and 
others alike, aims to elicit similar emotions.
As Goodkin said, “Someone already did the 
best narrative version [of The Odyssey] and 
that was Homer, so I have to do my own 
thing.” One of the final thoughts that he 
left us with is the idea that this story does 
not belong to anyone, and anyone can do 
something with it. No one should be afraid 
to try something new with something old, as 
Goodkin himself did.
Q
How do you tune your guitar and was there 
a particular purpose for it?
I use alternate tuning, which is an unfamiliar 
sequence that is really not heard anywhere 
else. I wanted the audience to sit a little and 
just listen… this natural sort of dissonance 
that I created made me think of water and I 
wanted audiences to relate to that.A
Q
Throughout your 296 performances or even 
from night to night, do things change? Like 
the vibe, the emotions, the atmosphere?
While this is the same piece I created from 
2002, things still change. The vibe, the 
emotions, these are just as important as 
the song itself. There are a lot of factors 
that can change my performance, whether 
I have allergies that day or if it is my third 
performance in two days. All of these things 
will create a slightly different performance. 
I like to explain this using an analogy of a 
boat. If you send a boat out to sea, when it 
returns is it still the same boat?A

Parasite

A foreign dark comedy thriller
12

---------------------------------------------------

Parasite is the latest film directed by Bong Joon-Ho, who over decades has won both critical and audience 
acclaim through films such as Memories of Murder, Okja, and Snowpiercer. The movie deals with a series of 
interactions that take place between a rich and a poor family, beginning when the eldest son of the poor family (played 
by Choi Woo-Shik) gets hired as an English tutor for a wealthy family, and he tries to fake the identities of his family 
members and get them hired as servants for the rich family.
This film won Bong a Palme d’Or at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival this May, as well as acclaim from critics around the 
world. That acclaim was well-deserved: Parasite is an incredible piece of filmmaking, masterclass in both writing and 
direction, and stands out as one of the best films to come out this year. Its story is layered, yet uncomplicated, and it’s as 
surprisingly entertaining as much as it is well-crafted.
Prior to the film’s release, Bong has said in an interview (translated from Korean): “My intention was not to use this 
film to analyze the rich and poor gap in a scholarly manner; instead, I wanted to project these ideas onto our everyday 
characters.” Bong does his best to flesh out these everyday characters and make them as realistic as possible. While 
many films about class struggles end up simply vilifying the wealthier group in service of the plot, this film deviates from 
that. No character in this film is purely good or evil; instead, they all feel like real people with complexities and flaws.
On top of realism, the idea of class struggle is depicted through symbolism and imagery. These themes are subtle, yet 
easy to grasp. Parasite is also incredibly subversive and filled with twists that are in service of the story. So again, avoiding 
spoilers should be paramount.
This film also flaunts some of Bong’s stylistic touches as a director that have been prominent in his earlier films. The 
cinematography that moves from top to bottom and vice-versa to convey class difference is one example of how this film 
employs visual storytelling. Slapstick is used throughout the film with varying effects, and the film is riddled with satirical 
elements that were also prevalent in Bong’s earlier films. This film also shows an absolute mastery at balancing different 
tones through the course of the film, taking its audiences from moments of comedy to thrills and shocks.
This film ultimately leaves its audience both with feelings of incredible satisfaction and bittersweetness. Its mastery in 
filmmaking and the layered themes will leave both critics and audiences with a lot to talk and think about. In the end, 
Parasite once again is a testament to why Bong is one of the best foreign directors working today and is deserving of all 
awards coming its way. Parasite comes out in U.S. theaters on Oct. 11.

article and photos by Sujay Utkarsh | Pillbox EditorShonen Knifeinterview with
Q: Who are your influences overall? What 
bands and artists have influenced your music 
and songwriting style over the decades?
Shonen Knife: When I started Shonen Knife, I liked 
to listen to The Beatles, and also the late ‘70s punk 
bands like The Ramones or The Buzzcocks. Now I 
don’t listen to punk music as much, but now I like 
to listen to hard rock, R&B, and ‘70s classic rock 
music.
Q: You’ve mentioned a lot of American groups, 
but are you influenced by any Japanese music 
or are you only influenced by non-Japanese 
music?
SK: No, mainly British and American music.
Q: Generally, what shifts have you seen in the 
Japanese punk scene, especially women in 
punk?
SK: I think we are not an actual punk band. The 
image of a punk band is usually more aggressive, 
and they sing about politics or anarchy or some-
thing. I think we are more of a pop or rock band. 
But I can say that the underground scene in Japan 
when we started, there were some all female 
bands or female rock musicians in Osaka when we 
started.
Q: You all have been around for a while. Over 
the course of 19 albums, did your sound evolve 
naturally or was it ever planned out?
SK: At the beginning, our music was more simple, 
but the spirit of our music has always been the 
same. After the ‘90s, we recorded with profes-
sional producers and I learned lots of things about 
recording and arrangement and making music from 
famous producers. Now we usually record and 
produce by ourselves. I have improved a lot after 
the ‘90s.
Q: Shifting away from the music, do you 
identify as a female band or do you consider 
yourselves just a band? Is female identity a part 
of your overall image as an artist and does it 
impact your music?
SK: We are not feminists, and I don’t think of 
myself as a female musician. Musicians are musi-
cians. Whether or not they are male or female, 
there is no meaning to that. So we are just musi-
cians. Since we are an all female band it’s easy 
because we can share a hotel room and everything 
is convenient.
Q: That’s interesting to hear because the 
responses from different all female groups var-
ies. Just to build off the last question, have you 
ever encountered any barriers for being an all 
female group in the music scene?
SK: I have not felt any barriers. There is only one 
thing I find difficult being a woman, and it’s that 
carrying equipment is very hard. That is the only 
difference from male bands.
Q: What are some of the differences you see 
between the Japanese music scene and the 
non-Japanese music scene?
SK: Our case is very, very rare, and no other 
Japanese band is touring outside for so long. But 
Japanese music is usually sung in Japanese, and 
it is very different from English, especially the 
phonics. So melody lines in Japanese are much dif-
ferent than melody lines in English. Japanese rock 
Recently Shonen Knife, an all-women punk trio hailing from the underground scene in Japan, came to Pittsburgh for their last show on their North 
America tour, and The Tartan had a chance to interview them. This is an edited transcription of the original audio interview. All of the questions were 
answered by the lead guitarist and main founder, Naoko Yamano.

---------------------------------------------------

15
music in general is very different from British and American rock music. But I 
am inspired by British and American rock music, so for me, English is the lan-
guage of rock. So I write the lyrics in English.
Q: What would you say are the differences between your interpretation 
of rock and punk music and your American and British counterparts?
SK: I think our music style is very unique. We have a lot of different styles of 
songs, ranging from pop-punk to hard rock to ballads. I listen to various kinds 
of music, especially ‘60s and ‘70s music, and inspired by that, I write some-
thing different. So I can’t compare our music style with other bands.
Q: Do you follow along with your fans’ reactions to your music and see 
how it has changed over the years?
SK: We have a very good reaction from our fans, especially the past ten 
years, where fans have been getting more energetic. When we started 
Shonen Knife, we played at a very tiny venue in Osaka, and Japanese audi-
ences are a bit different. But talking about America, they react to our shows 
with a very positive feeling. They come to our shows to enjoy themselves. So 
the reaction is always very good.
Q: So that you have said you’re from the Osaka underground scene. Is 
there something particular about that scene that allowed you to become 
popular? Like if you were in Tokyo and you tried to do the same thing, 
do you think you would have become as successful?
SK: I think the underground scene bands in Osaka are more free, and in 
Tokyo there are many major record companies. Many musicians who want to 
be popular or famous, they move to Tokyo. But the people who are in Osaka 
are more free, so a lot of bands from there go abroad, like Acid Mothers 
Temple and bands like that.
Q: How do you feel about the rise of girl groups like AKB48? Do you 
think the rise of these groups could be hurting the underground scene?
SK: AKB48 is just made by producers. They are not DIY or independent. But 
in our case, we do everything ourselves. My sister makes our stage costumes. 
I am emailing people overseas. AKB48 is kind of just controlled and made to 
act like cute dolls.
