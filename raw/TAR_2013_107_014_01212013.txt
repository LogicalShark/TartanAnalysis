The familiar brown apart-
ment building located on 214 
S. Craig St. has recently be-
come home to KBox, a karaoke 
house and business venture. 
It’s purpose is to strength-
en the Asian community of 
Pittsburgh.
The idea of the karaoke 
house was conceived in the 
fall of 2011 in Finger Lakes, 
New York, when 12 Chinese 
students — nine from Carn-
egie Mellon and three from 
University of Pittsburgh — 
were brainstorming a place 
in which Chinese students in 
need of a cultural haven could 
gather. 
What began as an effort 
to gather Chinese students 
evolved into an attempt to 
bring together students from 
all Asian countries. 
One year later, their idea 
came to life through the 
founding of KBox.
Inside the KBox building, 
rooms are decked with the 
latest sound systems, plush 
couches, and LCD TVs.
One of the co-founders, 
Huiman Tan — a Ph.D student 
in engineering and public pol-
icy — wanted a place where 
“Chinese students can gather, 
socialize, relax, re-connect 
with their culture.”
Other co-founders include 
’11 alumna Min Luo, infor-
mation management systems 
master’s student Pei Xiong, 
master’s student in the Lan-
guage Technologies Institute 
Duo Ding, Ph.D. student in the 
Robotics Institute Hua Zhong, 
and Ph.D. student in the Lan-
guage and Technologies Insiti-
tute Long Qin.  
“Students from China ?nd 
it dif?cult to make friends in 
the U.S.,” said Tan. “They seek 
other Chinese students and 
familiar sources of entertain-
ment.... So we came up with 
KBox, because Chinese people 
love to sing, and creating a 
place where they can gather to 
do that makes it easy for Chi-
nese students to meet other 
Chinese students.”
The rest of the co-founders 
agreed with Tan that Carnegie 
Mellon’s Chinese Scholar and 
Student Association was not 
enough of a social hub for 
them to interact with other 
Chinese students, since they 
only “organized parties dedi-
cated to major, traditional 
Chinese holidays.”
After a trial opening in 
August 2012, KBox of?cially 
opened up to the public on 
Sept. 16, and is now a growing 
business venture.
Their mission statement is 
to “create an entertainment 
house where students from 
all cultural backgrounds can 
gather to sing in private kara-
oke rooms,” Tan said. 
“With more than 90k songs 
— 76k Chinese songs and 15k 
English songs and 8k Korean 
songs — we hope to make 
it a haven not just for Asian 
students but also for students 
who just want to blow off 
steam.”
Coming up with the idea of 
a karaoke house was only the 
?rst step.
After solidifying their idea, 
the founders had to ?nd a lo-
cation for a karaoke house, 
buy a building, receive a 
building permit, and ?nd a 
contractor.

Carnegie Mellon students 
and staff have come together 
to test out a new composting 
program at Tazza D’Oro.
The program, part of the 
zero-waste composting proj-
ect at Carnegie Mellon, placed 
a bin at Tazza D’Oro Café and 
Espresso Bar. Customers now 
have the option of composting 
their food and biodegradable 
utensils.
Tazza D’Oro was chosen to 
pilot the program, organizers 
said, because it already uses 
some biodegradable cups, 
utensils, and containers.
This is not the ?rst com-
posting initiative to hit Carn-
egie Mellon.
“The food composting has 
really seemed to be something 
faculty, students, and staff are 
interested in,” Carnegie Mel-
lon Facilities Management 
Services (FMS) Environmen-
tal Coordinator Barbara Kviz 
said. 
“We just rolled out 11 new 
departmental composting pro-
grams. In FMS, we put our cof-
fee grounds [in composting]. 
We’ve been doing it now for 
well over a year.”
There are also several 
zero-waste events held on 
campus. According to Kviz and 
senior visual arts major Chloe 
Newman, one of the composting 
project’s organizers, the 
Almost Midnight Breakfast, 
the university staff picnic, and 
the homecoming chili cookoff 
have all been zero-waste 
events in the past.
“All of the cutlery, all of 
the food is compostable, and 
we have special compostable 
green bags at the event,” New-
man said.
Tazza D’Oro’s compost-
ing program is different from 
most previous composting at 
Carnegie Mellon because it is 
postconsumer. Preconsumer 
composting is done by trained 
workers during and after food 
preparation, while postcon-
sumer composting is done by 
customers by their own initia-
tive after they have purchased 
their food.
The major obstacle to post-
consumer composting, ac-
cording to the project’s orga-
nizers, is the lack of consumer 
education.
“We’re still in a phase 
where people need to be edu-
cated,” Kviz said. 
“There’s so many kinds of 
plastics, it’s confusing to know 
what can be composted and 
what can’t.”
Organizers have sought 
volunteers to stand by the 
composting bin and help cus-
tomers to compost correctly, 
but so far turnout has been 
low.
“It’s hard to talk to people 
without any reason, to ap-
proach a stranger,” said senior 
statistics major and former 
Sustainable Earth member 
Chris Conte, one of the proj-
ect’s organizers. “A lot of peo-
ple don’t care, they just want 
to get rid of their trash. I think 
the best way to change that is 
to educate people at freshmen 
orientation.”
One concern is the po-
tential for contamination of 
composting bins. The univer-
sity is charged extra for every 
bag of compost contaminated 
beyond a certain point, and 
Conte said contamination is 
already a problem on campus.
“You could look at any re-
cycling bin in the buildings, 
and there’s a lot of contamina-
tion,” he said.
One solution, according 
to Conte and Newman, is to 
make composting a little bit 
dif?cult — for instance, by 
putting lids on the bins while 
garbage cans are open — so as 
to dissuade people who don’t 
know what they’re doing from 
contaminating the compost-
ing bins.
“Once the compost bins are 
in place everywhere, then we 
can work on student behavior 
and getting people to compost 
correctly,” Conte said.
But Newman said she has 
seen people change their 
minds at the spur of the mo-
ment and decide to compost.
“It’s kind of funny to see 
them stop and take that extra 
second,” she said.
A list of compostable 
products can be found at 
bpiworld.org.

Frank Pfenning, profes-
sor of computer science, is 
the new head of the com-
puter science department. 
Pfenning succeeds Jeannette 
Wing, who stepped down to 
become the head of Microsoft 
Research International.
Pfenning says that he 
was initially hesitant to take 
on the job because it meant 
giving up a lot of teaching 
and research, both of which 
he enjoys. “In some ways, I 
thought, ‘I have the ideal job, 
so why change?’ ” However, 
on the insistence of faculty 
members, who assured him 
that he was the best person 
for the job, he agreed to ac-
cept the position.
“A lot of things in this job 
are centered around people, 
and I like talking to people, 
working with people, and 
supporting them in what 
they need to do, making sure 
they can get the right condi-
tions for whatever they want 
to do.... Those are the things 
that I really enjoy and think 
I can be fairly effective at,” 
Pfenning said. 
However, there are a few 
things Pfenning is not entire-
ly  looking forward to. “Well, 
I haven’t really had the big 
budget meeting. Figuring out 
the numbers and the balance 
of the budget. At home, my 
wife does our checkbook,” he 
said. 
Regarding his research 
and the effects of his new job 
on it, Pfenning said, “The way 
I’m trying to do it is to essen-
tially reduce the number of 
projects that I’m involved in, 
rather than just cutting back 
on 25 percent of each of the 
things that I do.” 
He plans to remain highly 
invested in two main proj-
ects. The ?rst is a project with 
some faculty in Qatar, which 
involves developing frame-
works for reasoning about 
programming languages. 
He will also remain in-
volved with a group in Por-
tugal that is working on 
developing a programming 
language that can easily prove 
properties of concurrent and 
distributed programs.
When asked whether he 
will continue to teach, Pfen-
ning said, “I love teaching too 
much to completely do away 
with it.” 
He has developed and 
taught the courses Principles 
of Imperative Computation 
(15–122), which is an in-
tegral part of the recently 
revised undergraduate com-
puter science curriculum, 
Compiler Design (15–411), 
and Constructive Logic (15–
317). 
He also played a key role 
in the development of Fun-
damentals of Programming 
Languages (15–312) along-
side Robert Harper.
Apart from his work, 
Pfenning enjoys playing 
squash and hiking. He is also 
an avid reader and especially 
enjoys classic literature and 
mysteries. 
When asked to share some 
learning from his experi-
ences, Pfenning said, “People 
tend to make this drastic dis-
tinction between arts and sci-
ences. I feel that they have 
much more in common than 
not. Both are human enter-
prises of understanding and 
communication.”
“Success in both is predi-
cated upon creativity. Do-
ing research and writing a 
scienti?c paper is analogous 
to writing and shooting a 
movie, for example. Writing a 
small and elegant program is 
like writing a poem,” he said.
His message to students 
who are looking to decide 
on career options is that they 
follow their passion, remain 
proud to serve, and maintain 
a balance in their lives, in or-
der to be happier and more 
productive.

Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon’s Center for Cogni-
tive Brain Imaging have pub-
lished new research explor-
ing how the human brain 
reacts to injuries.
Using a new combination 
of different magnetic imag-
ing methods, the research-
ers concluded that when an 
area of the brain is injured 
to an extent which impairs 
its functioning, secondary 
parts of the brain will act as 
a “back-up,” and take on the 
role of the injured part of the 
brain as well as its supporting 
areas. 
These results expand 
upon previous research con-
ducted by Center for Cogni-
tive Brain Imaging director, 
Marcel Just.
“The human brain has a 
remarkable ability to adapt 
to various types of trauma...
making it possible for people 
to continue functioning after 
key brain areas have been 
damaged,” Just stated in a 
university press release.
Senior psychology re-
searcher Robert Mason led 
the study, and Chantel Prat, 
an assistant professor of psy-
chology at the University of 
Washington, also contributed 
to the research. 
Mason added that the 
damaged area of the brain 
eventually returned to its pre-
vious levels of activity, while 
the “back-up team” of brain 
areas still functioned.

Beginning in the Fall 2013 
semester, the Tepper School 
of Business will offer a new 
option for students to com-
plete their MBA program, 
titled “FlexMBA.”
According to a university 
press release, the new pro-
gram will attempt to com-
bine “in-person sessions, 
online classes and self-paced 
learning to deliver the same 
coursework, faculty, team 
interaction, personal lead-
ership coaching, and career 
services found in the school’s 
highly acclaimed full-time 
and part-time MBA pro-
grams.” 
This new program will 
aim to create sections consist-
ing of 20 to 30 students, who 
will work toward their de-
gree over a 32-month period. 
“The new FlexMBA model 
draws on our school’s experi-
ence earned over nearly two 
decades of successful grad-
uate-level distance-learning 
programs and combines that 
knowledge with our exper-
tise in traditional full- and 
part-time MBA education,” 
said Michael Trick, senior as-
sociate dean for education at 
Tepper, in a university press 
release.
The program is structured 
so that students complete 
two courses over seven weeks 
and then meet with faculty 
and other students in a cen-
tral location for a three-day 
“Access Weekend.” Admis-
sion requirements and other 
components of the FlexMBA 
program may be found  on 
the Tepper School’s website.

Kosbie advises students on happiness, well-being in life
NIVEDITA CHOPRA
Juinor Staffwriter
At Carnegie Mellon, we 
see students working terribly 
hard just to get that A. But do 
grades make students happy, 
or is it the learning process 
that matters in the long run? 
David Kosbie, assistant 
teaching professor of com-
puter science, addressed this 
question in a talk he gave on 
the second day of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Odyssey program, 
Jan. 11. 
The talk, an invite-only 
event held in Baker Hall’s 
Adamson Wing, was attended 
by about 100 sophomores 
from various departments, 
including some from students 
from Carnegie Mellon’s Qatar 
campus.
Kosbie began by stating he 
was no expert on happiness, 
but just a “well-informed lay-
person.” He related his expe-
riences as an applied math-
ematics undergraduate at 
Harvard. 
After a year of struggling 
hard but performing poorly 
he realized that hard work 
alone without any heed to 
health and social interactions, 
was the wrong method for 
success. He encouraged 
students to look to their peers 
for support, academic or 
otherwise.
Relating this to Carnegie 
Mellon students, Kosbie went 
on to say that to remain happy 
at Carnegie Mellon, students 
should try to eat healthy 
food and sleep well. He also 
encouraged students to get 
regular exercise. He stressed 
the importance of socializing, 
especially through in-person 
interactions, as opposed to 
communication through 
electronic media or over the 
Internet. 
The message of student 
happiness and well-being 
especially resonated with 
sophomore decision science 
major Tonya Sedgwick, who 
remarked, “When he said that 
instructors care about the stu-
dents, I could see how he sin-
cerely meant it.”
Kosbie then related a few 
incidents from his employ-
ment at Microsoft prior to 
coming to teach at Carnegie 
Mellon. He assured the audi-
ence that some of the richest 
people he’d met in the com-
puter science industry were 
among the unhappiest people 
he has ever met. 
He af?rmed that although 
you do need some amount 
of money to live a comfort-
able life, there comes a point 
where the more money you 
earn, the unhappier you get. 
“Not one person in this room 
must make decisions based on 
money alone,” he said.
In addition to the lecture 
format of his talk, Kosbie also 
used audience participation 
activities to emphasize his 
points. At one point, Kosbie 
engaged students in a four-
minute meditation exercise 
to emphasize the importance 
of meditation in generating a 
sense of inner happiness. 
Kosbie also asked students 
to try some mental exercises 
intended to demonstrate that 
multitasking is less than half 
as ef?cient as doing the dif-
ferent tasks separately. Kos-
bie believes that doing away 
with multitasking while doing 
homework can help students 
save time and be happier.
Kosbie wrapped up his talk 
by assuring the students that 
faculty care about them and 
highly value student feedback 
on making academic life less 
stressful. 
He asked the students 
to come up with ideas that 
would make coursework less 
stressful; he promised to 
implement much of the feed-
back into his popular course 
15–112 Fundamentals of Pro-
gramming and Computer Sci-
ence. 
One of the suggestions 
brought up which reached a 
huge consensus among the 
audience was allowing stu-
dents to repeat a course to 
improve their grade and that 
the most recent grade should 
completely replace the older 
grade for that course. 
Arjun Hans, a sophomore 
computer science major, was 
impressed with the talk and 
Kosbie’s devotion to improv-
ing student life. “It’s really 
awesome when a professor 
takes such a keen interest 
in the students’ welfare,” he 
said. 
Kosbie encouraged the au-
dience to implement his sug-
gestions to bring happiness to 
their daily lives, at Carnegie 
Mellon and beyond.

Having found a house 
on Craig Street after three 
months of searching, the co-
founders then faced problems 
receiving a zoning permit 
from the Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Building Inspection, a neces-
sary requirement for opening 
business in the building. 
Tan said that the trouble 
with receiving a zoning per-
mit which lasted for two 
months was enough of a di-
lemma for her co-founders 
and her to think that “their 
project would be killed.”
According to Tan, the 
founders had issues with Oak-
land’s building inspectors, 
since there weren’t enough 
hired inspectors to check all of 
the buildings in the area, in-
cluding theirs. After research 
in building codes, Zhong “was 
able to argue his way with the 
license of?cer to get a license 
for starting a business in 
their building on South Craig 
Street,” Tan said.
“[KBox] had no money to 
hire lawyers like other big en-
trepreneurs, so Zhong studied 
[the] building codes of sev-
eral states.... It took a lot of 
effort, research, and persever-
ance for Zhong to get a license 
to set up a karaoke house in 
our building,” Tan said.
They continued to face 
more issues with the building, 
they needed to ?nd a cheap 
contractor in Pittsburgh who 
could rebuild the interior of 
the rundown building. 
“Despite most of us being 
computer science majors, we 
designed the building plan 
and submitted it to our con-
tractor. We did everything, 
from the soundproof walls to 
the interior decorating. We 
raised a total of 20K, which 
came from our pockets to re-
design the interior,” Tan said.
in regards to future plans, 
Tan said, “We plan on expand-
ing KBox to take on partner-
ships with local Asian restau-
rants in Squirrel Hill, as well 
as extending sponsorship out-
side of CMU. We also want to 
attract a larger population of 
students from other schools 
like Pitt and Duquesne; that 
way, there will be a wider web 
of connections.”
When asked whether KBox 
seems like a good social hub 
for students, ?rst-year deci-
sion science major Steven 
Wang, a Chinese-American 
student, said, “Yeah, I think 
KBox is a good place to recon-
nect with your cultural roots if 
you’re Chinese since you can 
meet up with other Chinese 
friends, but at the same time 
I would go to KBox just to sing 
even if I wasn’t Chinese.”
When asked if KBox added 
to diversifying Chinese com-
munity life on campus, ?rst-
year computer science and 
math double major Jichao 
Sun said, “It seems unique. 
It’s not your average Chinese 
student association club.”
KBox hopes to continue 
expanding their business in 
order to attract people who 
want to sing American, Japa-
nese, Korean, and Chinese 
music. 
“We now wish to popular-
ize KBox to all students and 
not just Asian students,” Tan 
said.

Just as last semester drew 
to a close, University Presi-
dent Jared Cohon became 
the victim of a threat, which 
resulted in Pittsburgh Police 
protecting his house for 24 
hours. 
According to a report 
by the Pittsburgh Tribune-
Review, Pittsburgh Police 
Deputy Chief Paul Donaldson 
stated that a threat against 
President Cohon was received 
on Dec. 6, 2012, adding that 
police cars had been stationed 
outside of Cohon’s house in 
response.
There was the fear that the 
man who threatened Cohon 
may have been heading to 
Pittsburgh in a car bearing a 
Massachusetts license plate.
The threat was thought to 
have been received through 
the mail. The Trib reported 
that the Postal Inspector’s of-
?ce is also involved in the in-
vestigation.
The University has been 
reluctant to release details on 
the matter. 
Teresa Thomas, Carnegie 
Mellon’s assistant vice presi-
dent for media relations, de-
clined to comment on the 
matter to media sources.

Professor, students take a trip to an alien destination
SONIA KATHARANI-KHAN
Junior Staffwriter
While students and fac-
ulty prepared for their holiday 
travels, Carnegie Mellon phys-
ics professor Diane Turnshek, 
physics Ph.D. candidate Nora 
Swisher, and art master’s stu-
dent Dan Wilcox made prepa-
rations to embark on a journey 
to another planet.
Turnshek, Swisher, and 
Wilcox were selected by The 
Mars Society as part of a six-
member team to explore a 
long-held human curiosity: 
the possibility of humans liv-
ing on Mars. For the past 12 
years, The Mars Society has 
been conducting experiments 
to gain insight into how as-
tronauts would survive if they 
took an expedition to Mars.
Each year The Mars Soci-
ety selects a six-member team 
every two weeks to travel to 
their Mars Desert Research 
station (MDRS) near Hanks-
ville, Utah from December to 
May. The research station con-
sists of a two-story cylindrical 
habitat for living, a building 
reserved for waste treatment 
and biological projects called 
the Greenhab and the Musk 
Observatory. For two weeks, 
each group lives and conducts 
experiments just as astronauts 
would on Mars.
An Ethereal Simulation
At MDRS, the team’s re-
search spanned both geologi-
cal and biological aspects of 
life on Mars. To gain a more 
concrete understanding of 
Mars’ environment, the crew 
traveled through airlocks, 
photographed geological for-
mations, and studied rock 
and soil samples. According to 
Turnshek, the most interest-
ing ?ndings were those that 
would not be found on Mars, 
such as “fossil shell beds as 
far as the eye could see, tree 
trunks turned to fossilized 
wood, and ancient animal 
bones,” she said via email.
Although these ?ndings 
didn’t suggest a Martian envi-
ronment, Turnshek was con-
?dent that the method of ob-
taining them would have been 
helpful on a Mars expedition. 
“We experienced the dif?culty 
of doing ?eldwork in space-
suits. Had we actually been on 
Mars, the way we identi?ed 
interesting sites, mapped out 
and navigated the routes, and 
collected samples would have 
served us well,” she said.
Traveling in spacesuits was 
just one of the many dif?cul-
ties the team members faced. 
During their time at the re-
search station, they came face 
to face with the challenges 
that would accompany giving 
up every day earthly conve-
niences and adjusting to an 
environment with a harsh cli-
mate and an intense drop in 
gravity.
All three agreed that the 
largest challenges of living 
on Mars were “the human 
factors,” such as “communi-
cation, relative boredom, de-
pression, and food fatigue.” 
Isolation and team hierarchies 
created rifts in communica-
tion. “Asking for guidance 
was a procedural pain, and 
the mission commander made 
decisions for us without being 
onsite,” Turnshek said. “For 
instance, we were con?ned 
to the habitat after a snowfall 
that was deemed too danger-
ous to walk in.”
“I think we can ?gure out 
all the technological challeng-
es of getting to and living on 
Mars, but the human factors 
will make or break a mission,” 
Swisher said.
Scienti?c and Artistic 
Inspirations
For all three, the trip 
played a signi?cant part in 
their current work and future 
goals. For Swisher, the expe-
dition was a signi?cant step 
toward achieving her child-
hood dream of becoming an 
astronaut.
“My goal of becoming an 
astronaut was not serious un-
til MDRS.... Now I’m going to 
sign up for the Mars One as-
tronaut training for a potential 
future trip to Mars,” she said  
via email.
After her experience at 
MDRS, Swisher plans to go 
backpacking, participate in 
outreach programs for young-
er students, and possibly make 
a second trip to Utah or do 
similar simulations in other 
parts of the world.
“I have academic and re-
search experience in my ?eld, 
but MDRS has given me pro-
fessional experience in a total-
ly different category,” she said.
Both Wilcox and Turnshek 
intend to use this experience 
in their upcoming works of art 
and ?ction.
Although Wilcox is a third-
year MFA student, he grew up 
amidst NASA activity in his 
hometown in Alabama, and 
therefore cultivated an inter-
est in space travel. “As an art-
ist, I feel my role is to be doing 
research in development for 
humanity,” he explained.
Wilcox plans to include 
concepts and artifacts from his 
expedition, such as pictures of 
different soil types, in his the-
sis. This March, his graduating 
class will be presenting a Mas-
ter of Fine Arts Thesis show at 
the Miller Gallery. His thesis 
project is a live musical per-
formance “Robot Cowboy On-
ward to Mars,” and a concept 
album about humans living on 
Mars.
Turnshek teaches Introduc-
tion to Astronomy and Experi-
mental Physics at Carnegie 
Mellon, and teaches astron-
omy and The Physics of Sci-
ence Fiction at the University 
of Pittsburgh. Writing science 
?ction is one of her many hob-
bies; in 2011, she co-authored 
an award-winning book on 
?ction writing,  Many Genres/
One Craft. Her upcoming nov-
el No Experience, is a young- 
adult adventure novel that 
takes place on Mars.
“My time spent on ana-
log Mars fueled my writing,” 
she said. “I now know what 
extreme water conservation 
feels like. Making use of ev-
erything — things I would 
have thrown away without a 
thought beforehand. My life 
depending on my vehicle … I 
have achieved my goal of now 
being able to write ?ction with 
verisimilitude.”
The Future of Colonization
Colonization of Mars has 
largely been seen as a dream 
ful?lled only in science ?ction. 
However, Turnshek, Swisher, 
and Wilcox hope to convey 
that it is attainable, and per-
haps even necessary.
Aside from NASA, a num-
ber of private companies are 
taking steps to establish hu-
man presence on Mars. Mars 
One, a nonpro?t company, 
plans to begin establishing 
colonies on Mars by 2023. The 
company is currently seeking 
groups of four astronauts to 
periodically send on reality 
TV-style missions to Mars.
Those selected would pay 
for their own travel and their 
journey would be publicly vis-
ible. “The kicker is that these 
missions are set up as a series 
of one-way trips,” Turnshek 
said. The idea may seem bi-
zarre, but according to Wilcox, 
there has been more than a 
signi?cant number of volun-
teers.
Colonization of Mars will 
be different from prior space 
expeditions because, in Turn-
shek’s words, it will be more 
than “a ?ags-and-footprints 
mission to just say we’ve been 
there…. We need an actual 
reason to colonize Mars.” And 
it appears that we have quite a 
compelling one.
According to Turnshek, 
“Scientists have recognized 
that having humans living in 
a sustainable colony is a safety 
measure for the continuance 
of our species in case of a di-
saster on Earth…. For the sake 
of humankind, we need to get 
off the planet.”
Turnshek believes there 
could be human presence on 
Mars within a few decades. 
Swisher and Wilcox hope to 
see an expedition even sooner. 
“Technological ability is not 
preventing us from going to 
Mars. If we put in the money 
and manpower, we could go to 
Mars in the next 10–15 years 
… it’s a matter of will, not abil-
ity,” Swisher said.
After their experience, all 
three hope to encourage in-
volvement in space expedi-
tions. “Mars might be look-
ing for a few good men and 
women, but those who go will 
be counting on us to have their 
backs. It takes a planet to send a 
colony to Mars,” Turnshek said.
“What’s interesting to me 
about this project is thinking 
about approaching something 
that has a meaning beyond 
just our generation or just 
our time. I really think the 
de?ning moment of our time 
should be … that humans go 
to Mars,” Wilcox said.
Robots use eye movement for greater social interaction
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor 
Imagine a world where 
robots walk and talk indistin-
guishably among us. Robotics 
professor Yaser Sheikh and 
mechanical engineering Ph.D. 
student Hyun Soo Park are 
working on research that will 
one day allow robots to under-
stand and adapt upon social 
interactions.
“Currently, robots have 
a very good understanding 
of the environment around 
them, the geometric relation-
ships,” Park said. “But we 
think that they need more in-
formation. In order for robots 
to be collaborative with hu-
mans as a team member, they 
need to understand the social 
context they are in. Robots can 
do tasks, but truly interacting 
with humans requires some 
sort of empathy.”
But how can robots pos-
sibly understand social in-
teractions? Sheikh and Park 
have developed an algorithm 
that takes into account where 
people are looking in order to 
analyze the social context of a 
situation.
“The gaze is a very inter-
esting social signal,” Park 
said. “Where you are look-
ing at is a very strong cue to 
understand[ing] what is go-
ing on around you.” By using 
head-mounted cameras to 
track where people look, one 
can determine the point where 
the most gazes intersect. 
Sheikh and Park use the 
videos captured by head-
mounted cameras to track the 
directions people are looking 
at. The algorithm works by 
knowing where two people 
are and the directions they are 
looking at, and extends these 
directions to ?nd where they 
meet. The point with the most 
intersections is determined 
to be the most important, or 
most “socially salient,” event 
in the room.
One application of this con-
cept is integrating robots into 
the work force. “A number of 
professionals already wear 
head-mounted cameras, such 
as soldiers, search and rescue 
teams, and police of?cers,” 
Sheikh said.
Park also mentioned that 
this method of analyzing so-
cial behavior can be used to 
study children with autism. 
Either the clinician, parent, 
or the child would wear the 
head-mounted camera.
However, Sheikh believes 
that head-mounted cameras 
will soon become popular 
among ordinary consumers as 
well. “I consider it likely that 
head-mounted sensors and 
displays will be as common-
place in a decade as smart-
phones are today,” he said.
In fact, the prototype of 
Google Glass is scheduled to 
come out soon. Google Glass is 
an aluminum strip with a dis-
play, a camera, and two nose 
pads that one can wear like a 
pair of glasses. Park explained 
how the cameras that were 
originally used for their proj-
ect were relatively large and 
bulky; the more recent models 
are more accurate, smaller, 
and can be worn conveniently 
as a headset.
“Google Glass could im-
prove the accuracy of our 
research because of its sleek-
ness,” Park said. “Although the 
downside is that its resolution 
will probably not be as good.” 
High resolution is important 
to their research because it 
helps them better estimate a 
camera’s position and orien-
tation in three-dimensional 
space.
The quest to interpret hu-
man interactions for robots 
can be further improved by 
incorporating other inputs be-
sides gaze intersections, such 
as facial expressions or audio 
signals. Sheikh explained how 
small gestures such as a casual 
shrug or a slight nod of the 
head are easily interpreted by 
humans. 
“Human perception is in-
credibly good at picking these 
up, and we’re trying to under-
stand how to develop algo-
rithms that can do so too,” he 
said. “To this end, we’ve built 
a massive sensing dome in the 
basement of Newell-Simon 
with hundreds of cameras, 
and are developing algorithms 
to learn from what these cam-
eras see.”
Sheikh and Park have been 
using head-mounted cameras 
to understand social interac-
tions for the past year and 
are funded by the National 
Science Foundation. As they 
continue their research, their 
?ndings will not only help hu-
mans better understand social 
dynamics and behavioral dis-
orders, but may one day help 
robots understand us too.

The human body consists 
of 78 organs and 13 organ 
systems that work collabora-
tively like a well-oiled ma-
chine. Among the most vital is 
the heart, which pumps 2,000 
gallons of blood per day to en-
sure oxygen and nutrients are 
being circulated throughout 
the body. As humans age, the 
heart may begin to pump less 
ef?ciently. 
According to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), 
each year over 3,000 patients 
suffering from heart failure 
need a heart transplant to en-
sure their survival but have to 
wait patiently until a donor 
heart can be found. Unfortu-
nately, only about 2,000 heart 
transplants are performed 
annually, leaving a few thou-
sand people without a healthy 
heart. Fortunately, an arti?-
cial heart can be used in the 
most severe cases to allow pa-
tients to return to their daily 
lives until a suitable donor 
heart is available.
In order to understand how 
an arti?cial heart works, it is 
?rst important to know how 
the four chambers of a nor-
mal human heart function. 
Blood circulates throughout 
the body by delivering oxy-
gen to other organs from the 
right atrium of the heart. The 
heart’s primary function is to 
pump this blood through the 
right ventricle to the lungs, 
where it gets replenished with 
oxygen. The blood then re-en-
ters the heart at the left atri-
um and is pumped through 
the left ventricle to the rest of 
the body.
During the ?rst stage of a 
heartbeat, the two atria con-
tract, pumping the blood to 
the ventricles. During the sec-
ond stage, the ventricles con-
tract, causing blood to leave 
the heart through the pulmo-
nary artery to the lungs and 
through the aorta to the rest 
of the body.
Contrary to popular be-
lief, an arti?cial heart only 
replaces the two ventricles 
and connects to the natural 
atrium. Unlike the normal 
heart, which pumps blood to 
the lungs and body at same 
time, an arti?cial heart can 
force blood out of only one 
ventricle at a time.
Currently, there are two 
leading designs of the arti?-
cial heart that utilize different 
methods to force the blood 
out of the ventricles.
SynCardia Systems, Inc. 
has developed a heart with 
two ventricles separated by 
a diaphragm, similar to the 
muscle that expands and con-
tracts in our bodies when we 
breathe. Blood ?lls one ventri-
cle and is ejected when an ex-
ternal pump ejects air into the 
other side of the diaphragm. 
Howitworksdaily.com states 
this model has been approved 
by the FDA —but the only 
downside is that it requires an 
external pump weighing about 
13-and-a-half pounds that can 
?t in a backpack.
Having external parts can 
increase the risk of infec-
tion. AbioCor, the arti?cial 
heart developed by AbioMed 
addresses this problem by 
having all the necessary 
components inside the body. 
Instead of a diaphragm and 
an air pump, this heart uses 
a hydraulic pump. According 
to howstuffworks.com, when 
the hydraulic ?uid moves to 
the right, blood in the right 
ventricle gets pumped to the 
lungs. Conversely, when hy-
draulic ?uid moves to the left, 
the blood in the left ventricle 
gets pumped to the rest of the 
body.
Both arti?cial hearts need 
a source of energy to ensure 
that the heart beats continu-
ously so that a patient doesn’t 
succumb to cardiac arrest. 
The SynCardia Total Arti?cial 
Heart has two external re-
chargeable batteries and can 
also be plugged into a wall 
outlet. The AbiCor heart also 
has an external battery pack 
but utilizes a wireless energy 
transfer system to transmit 
power through the skin with-
out penetrating the surface.
Generally, the hearts are 
made of titanium and plastic. 
One of the biggest challenges 
is inserting an arti?cial ob-
ject into the body and having 
the body accept it. During a 
seven-hour surgery, hundreds 
of stitches are used to attach 
the arti?cial device to the pa-
tient’s natural tissue with syn-
thetic tissue called grafts.
Arti?cial hearts have been 
a growing success as technol-
ogy continues to improve al-
lowing patients to live longer 
with the heart without the 
risk of infection. This past year 
was monumental for SynCar-
dia Systems, Inc. as the com-
pany successfully completed 
125 implants. According to 
the New England Journal of 
Medicine, 79 percent of pa-
tients who receive a trans-
plant survive long enough to 
receive a donor heart. Howev-
er, escaping death does have 
a price — covering the cost 
of an arti?cial heart requires  
about $125,000, and a yearly 
maintenance fee of $18,000.
After over 900 successful 
implants, the arti?cial heart 
continues to improve so that 
patients can live longer and 
infection free. Finding a do-
nor heart, however, is still the 
best option for patients.
Russia to launch unmanned probe to moon by 2015
Russia will resume explor-
ing the moon by sending an 
unmanned probe, called the 
Luna-Globe or Moon-Globe, 
in 2015. Luna-Globe would 
have an orbital module and a 
probe that sends back infor-
mation about samples from 
the moon. 
The probe will be accom-
panied by three military satel-
lites. According to the Russian 
news agency Interfax, the 
probe will be carried by the 
?rst rocket to blast off from 
Russia’s newly built facility in 
eastern Amur. The last time 
Russia successfully sent an 
unmanned probe to the moon 
was in the 1970s; Russia has 
yet to send a man to the moon.

‘Goldenrod’ plant can respond to the scent of fruit ?ies
A study at Pennsylvania 
State University showed that 
solidago — commonly known 
as goldenrod — produces 
chemical defenses when it 
senses sex hormones released 
by male fruit ?ies. The plant 
releases an odor in response 
to repel female fruit ?ies, 
keeping them from laying 
their eggs on the goldenrod. 
This is bene?cial to the 
plant’s reproduction, since 
those that harbor fruit ?y 
eggs tend to produce fewer 
and smaller seeds. “... it seems 
that plants may sometimes 
be able to smell the insects 
themselves,” said Mark Me-
scher, an entomologist at 
Penn State.

New robotic ?sh can glide through water inde?nitely
Scientists at Michigan 
State University construct-
ed a robotic ?sh that glides 
through the water while using 
little to no energy. Its name 
is GRACE, which stands for 
Gliding Robot ACE, and it is 10 
times smaller and lighter than 
other underwater gliders. It 
utilizes a hybrid mechanism 
of gliding and swimming.
Like an actual ?sh, GRACE 
has a bladder-like mechanism 
that pushes water in and out, 
allowing it to ascend and de-
scend. GRACE gathers valu-
able data that aids the clean-
ing of rivers and lakes, and 
was recently released for a 
test run in the oil-contaminat-
ed Kalamazoo River.

British weigh in on ‘third parent’ fertility treatments
The British public was 
consulted about the ethics of 
fertility treatment that uses 
DNA from a third parent to 
eliminate genetic diseases. 
According to the Human 
Fertilization and Embryol-
ogy Authority, some of these 
diseases can have mild to no 
symptoms while others can 
have fatal or life-shortening 
symptoms. 
One in 200 children are 
born with mitochondrial 
disease and one in 6,500 
British-born people suffer 
from severe symptoms. The 
proposed technique replaces 
mitochondrial DNA from the 
mother with healthy DNA 
from a “third parent.” Scien-
tists and ethicists alike are 
concerned with future im-
plicaions, such as the rights 
of the “third parent.”

Autistic children can improve, lose diagnosis with age
The National Institute of 
Health con?rmed that some 
autistic children lose their 
diagnosis as they grow older. 
Deborah Fein, a professor at 
the University of Connecticut, 
paired 34 optimal-outcome 
children diagnosed with au-
tism early in life with 44 chil-
dren with high-functioning 
autism. 
Results showed the opti-
mal-outcome children to have 
milder social de?cits than 
the high-functioning autistic 
children. However, they had 
communication and behav-
ioral problems that were just 
as severe of that in the latter 
group. Continuing studies 
may show whether it is the 
verbal IQ levels of the opti-
mal-outcome children that 
caused their conditions to 
improve.

Newly discovered quasar challenges physical principle
Astronomers discovered 
a group of quasars so large 
that they would require 4 bil-
lion years to cross while trav-
eling at the speed of light. 
This large quasar group has 
dimensions of 500 megapar-
secs, each measuring 3.3 mil-
lion light years. This makes it 
1,600 times longer than the 
distance from the Milky Way 
to our closest galaxy.
Roger Clowes, leader of 
the team researching this 
large quasar group, will con-
tinue to investigate the phe-
nomenon while challeng-
ing the perfect cosmological 
principle. It states that when 
viewed from a distance, one 
part of the universe looks just 
like any other part.

The University has recently taken 
an initiative to improve the path con-
necting the Morewood and WQED 
parking lots. There is a new concrete 
staircase, and the existing wooden 
steps have been renovated to include 
two side-by-side staircases. Lamp 
posts have also been installed along 
the path. However, the improve-
ments to this area on the outskirts 
of campus should not stop here; they 
present the opportunity for further 
safety measures to be made to this 
path.
Unfortunately, the passage resid-
ing between the parking lot behind 
Morewood Gardens and the WQED 
of?ce has earned a reputation as 
being an unsafe and frightening 
place to travel through, especially 
at night. For this reason, the path is 
often referred to as “the rape trail” 
by students. It is unacceptable that 
members of the Carnegie Mellon 
community must travel on a pathway 
that appears frightening enough at 
night to be associated with the risk 
of sexual assault. This association 
is of special concern because many 
?rst-years who live in the Residence 
on Fifth commute to and from their 
dorm using this pathway.
A clear way to improve this 
scenario would be to install an 
emergency button on the pathway so 
that students traveling on the path 
would be able to easily call campus 
police if needed.
The pathway between the 
Morewood parking lot and the 
WQED parking lot has long been the 
subject of speculation, stories, and  
jokes among the campus community. 
We commend The University 
for their initiatives to renovate 
the pathway and increase student 
safety. The University should con-
tinue this trend by complementing 
the improved stairs with an emer-
gency call system to better protect 
the student body.
Pathway renovations are a step in the right direction
Legislation necessary in wake of recent tragedies
Diversity of dining facilities should be commended

Carnegie  Mellon has students 
with a wide range of ethnic back-
grounds, and we pride ourselves on 
this diversity. Because the student 
body is composed of such a wide 
variety of backgrounds, individuals 
also have a wide range of dietary 
needs.
Housing and Dining Services con-
cerns itself with the students’ dietary 
preferences at the University, and it 
shows. With the recent addition of 
The Pomegranate — a vendor offer-
ing kosher, vegetarian, and vegan 
options — as well as other specialty 
vendors like Worlds of Flavor and the 
Crêperie last semester, it is obvious 
that Housing and Dining Services 
hopes to better accommodate stu-
dents’ needs.
According to the University’s 
Housing and Dining website, The 
Pomegranate’s owner Zur Gold-
blum, former chef of Middle Eastern 
restaurant Sababa in Squirrel Hill, 
created a menu “to re?ect cuisines 
with ?avors from the Middle East, 
Turkey, and Israel.”
In the past, students could pur-
chase frozen kosher meals or sand-
wiches at other campus locations, 
but were unable to purchase fresh 
kosher meals. Jewish students keep-
ing kosher on campus and students 
who keep their meal choices impul-
sive will no doubt appreciate the op-
tions now available to them.
Goldblum also added to the Uni-
versity’s vegetarian and vegan offer-
ings with The Pomegranate’s falafel 
and babaganoush. 
Located in the General Motors 
Room on the second ?oor of the Uni-
versity Center, The Pomegranate of-
?cially opened this Thursday.
By continuing to add a variety of 
eateries throughout campus, Hous-
ing and Dining Services allows stu-
dents to be satis?ed with their di-
ets at their home away from home. 
Even though it may not be able to 
provide meals as exciting as a real 
home-cooked one, Housing and Din-
ing Services is clearly trying to hire 
vendors and chefs, like Goldblum, 
that will provide the closest possible 
experience.
Because college meal plans are 
expensive, students deserve to be 
satis?ed with their provided meals. 
Housing and Dining Services is 
well on its way to achieving that 
satisfaction.
President Barack Obama intro-
duced a new legislative agenda and 
executive orders for greater federal 
gun control last Wednesday, which 
has left both sides of the debate 
?ercely supporting their values. Gun 
control advocates have looked to the 
President to endorse and implement 
stricter gun control, especially on 
assault weapons. However, pro-gun 
activists have called such measures 
unconstitutional and in direct viola-
tion of the Second Amendment.
It seems that now people agree 
that there needs to be some change 
to prevent massacres like the New-
town, Conn. and Aurora, Colo. mass 
shootings from happening again. 
New legislation regarding the sale 
and use of ?rearms is a necessity in 
the wake of these tragedies.
One of the primary steps is to 
prevent the ?rearms already in cir-
culation from getting into the wrong 
hands. This requires more ef?cient 
screening processes.
The President’s current proposal 
would support universal background 
checks on gun sales and would aim to 
form tougher gun traf?cking regula-
tions , thus increasing the likelihood 
of there being a paper trail between 
gun sellers and end users.
These measures, if enforced, 
could make a difference in the pre-
vention of future gun violence and 
crime. Both sides have begun a con-
versation regarding background 
checks and mental health screen-
ings. While there is fervent opposi-
tion to several aspects of the pro-
posal, such as reinstating the ban on 
assault weapons and limiting ammu-
nition magazines to 10 rounds, any 
bipartisan support at all for a gun 
control bill is a strong indicator that 
people realize changes need to be 
made to gun regulations.
Mental health evaluations are 
also a key factor in curbing future 
episodes of mass violence. Eliminat-
ing the social stigma of mental dis-
orders, improving access to mental 
health experts, and improving train-
ing for such of?cials in the areas of 
warning signs and red ?ags are a ma-
jor factor in preventing violence.
The legislation currently intro-
duced makes steps in the right direc-
tion, but needs to ensure that Second 
Amendment rights are protected for 
U.S. citizens. Emphasizing the need 
to ensure that ?rearms do not fall 
into the hands of criminals and the 
mentally unstable should be the 
?agship goal of gun control efforts, 
as these efforts will do the most to 
create actual, responsible change in 
Washington.

Understandably, after the recent 
shooting at Sandy Hook Elemen-
tary School where 27 children were 
killed, some Americans have been 
vying for stricter gun control. While 
this spike is predictable after such a 
tragedy and statistics show it hap-
pening after just about every gun 
massacre, according to The New 
York Times, this spike is both higher 
and has lasted longer than usual. 
The children killed at Sandy Hook 
have shaken our social conscious-
ness. We — and more importantly, 
President Obama — have decided to 
do something about it this time. It's 
not nearly enough, but it is a step in 
the right direction.
Washington has decided to ap-
proach the issue in two different 
ways. There is a faction that believes 
that tightly written bills and the 
legislative process are enough, and 
there is another that believes that 
with this sort of politically charged 
atmosphere, guerilla warfare such 
as executive actions might be the 
best way to handle this. They want 
to change things; they’re just not 
sure how to do it in the best way.
The NRA, for its part, has been 
making different propositions to end 
gun violence as well. Its answer is to 
match a bad guy with a gun with a 
good guy with a gun. Members be-
lieve that establishing armed guards 
in schools is the only thing that will 
stop the gunmen.
When Obama disagreed with 
the belief that more guns were the 
solution to the problem, the NRA 
released a video calling Obama an 
elitist hypocrite for not wanting to 
protect school children but using the 
Secret Service to protect his daugh-
ters at school, as if the daughters of 
the President of the United States 
don’t need that kind of protection.
But I’m inclined to believe that 
armed guards in schools would 
work, at least as a deterrent for any-
one planning something in school.
More thorough and universal 
background checks may be the 
sweet spot between pro-gun control 
and anti-gun control protesters. As 
of now, private sellers and sellers 
at gun shows don’t have to require 
background checks, and different 
states can check different databases. 
Obama promises to crack down on 
them as well, but there’s no guaran-
tee that people who don't pass back-
ground checks won’t get guns.
Obama is also reinstating the ban 
on assault ri?es that expired in 1994 
and renewing the 10-round limit on 
ammunition magazines. The limit 
on ammunition is something even 
gun owners can get behind. The 
problem that still exists with this is 
people called “straw purchasers,” 
who buy guns and then sell them to 
people who might not have passed 
the background check, no matter 
how thorough it was. Of course, 
people will ?nd a way to get big-
ger ammunition magazines as well. 
Obama’s orders are a great start, but 
are not enough.
The problem is that Obama is do-
ing all of this instead of addressing 
the underlying causes of such vio-
lence. He’s trying to make access to 
mental health facilities more readily 
available, but with the social stigma 
surrounding mental health disor-
ders, not everyone that needs the 
help will get it. Some states, such 
as Pennsylvania, have also required 
mental health hospital stays if the 
individual is proven to be a threat to 
themselves or their environment. 
But that’s also dif?cult: Where 
is the line drawn? How can you tell 
people that they are required to 
spend time in a mental health insti-
tution before they are considered ?t 
for society? Is that presumable gain 
to society worth the cost, both psy-
chologically and monetarily, for that 
individual?
Society also has a misconception 
that video games or the mass media 
are some of the underlying causes of 
violence these days, and I hope that 
this misconception doesn’t translate 
to wasting policy on video games as 
an effort to reduce violence.
The important thing for anti-gun 
control protesters to understand is 
that no one is “taking” your guns. 
No one is trying to take away your 
constitutional rights. We’re just try-
ing to make it harder for the Adam 
Lanzas of the world to get guns.

A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled by Jonathan Carreon and Jennifer Coloma
January 21, 2013 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
The Tartan is excited to be back this week. So we asked,
What did you miss most about college over winter break?
LEADERSHIP PERSPECTIVESenate highlights Town Hall Week
As the New Year and the new 
semester have both begun, Student 
Senate is back to work making our 
Carnegie Mellon community and 
campus a better environment for 
all students.
Many of you may remember our 
efforts to reach out and connect 
with students during Senate Week 
last fall. As a body, we were very 
happy with the level of engage-
ment and excitement that students 
showed in stopping by the table, 
?lling out surveys, naming their 
senators, and answering trivia 
questions about Senate.
From our perspective, Sen-
ate Week was very successful, 
and something that will hope-
fully grow to become a tradition at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Our goal coming into this se-
mester is to continue our engage-
ment with fellow students, but 
this time with a feedback and 
discussion-oriented style. To this 
end, Student Senate will be host-
ing our ?rst ever Town Hall Week 
Jan. 28th to Feb. 1st! For the three 
days leading up to our Thursday 
General Body Meeting, Senators 
from each individual college will 
be hosting an open Town Hall 
meeting.
The schedule for the Town Halls 
will be up on our Facebook page at 
www.facebook.com/cmusenate, 
and you should be receiving an 
email from your college’s Sena-
tors regarding your college’s Town 
Hall.
There will be food at each of 
these events, so stop by to grab 
a bite to eat and hear from your 
Senators what they’ve been work-
ing on. 
Beyond that, we will be asking 
a series of open-ended questions to 
hear your opinions on big-picture 
issues on campus, as well as issues 
related to your home college.
Your thoughts and ideas, as 
always, will be used to drive our 
projects and initiatives for the rest 
of the semester. 
The end goal, as always, is to 
make Carnegie Mellon a better 
place for you. So save the date, 
and keep an eye out on Facebook, 
Twitter, and all across campus for 
more information about these 
events!
Thanks,

Another chapter in the ongoing 
clash between those who would like 
to see a free and open Internet and 
those who wish to regulate it came 
to a tragic end on Jan. 11 when pro-
grammer and prominent activist Aar-
on Swartz took his own life.
Swartz appeared to be under 
a great deal of stress due to pres-
sure from the federal government. 
He allegedly hacked into networks 
at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and downloaded 4.8 
million documents from JSTOR, a 
database of academic publications 
that many students here at Carnegie 
Mellon are familiar with. 
I’d also wager that a lot of people 
here are familiar with one of Swartz’s 
other pet projects, Reddit, which one 
of his start-ups merged with.
Swartz’s suicide does not change 
the fact that what he allegedly did 
was illegal, and I can’t bring myself 
to fully endorse his methods.
I agree wholeheartedly that 
scholarly journals should be 
free and open to the public, but 
circumventing the proper channels 
to meet these ends does little to 
further the cause. There can be a ?ne 
line between protest and breaking 
the law. If only the line were easier to 
judge, perhaps Swartz might be alive 
today.
Another thing to consider while 
dissecting this case is if the govern-
ment is in any way to blame for driv-
ing Swartz to his demise. According 
to Think Progress, a liberal blog, the 
sentence that the federal government 
was aiming to charge Swartz with — 
50 years in prison — is greater than 
the maximum sentence allowed for 
selling child pornography, know-
ingly spreading AIDS, and, in some 
cases, selling slaves.
Granted, Swartz was reported 
to previously have had suicidal 
thoughts, and his suicide may have 
just been a culmination of many 
different factors. Only time will tell 
what, if any, repercussions his sui-
cide has. 
While I completely disagree with 
those who say it was the government 
who actively conspired to kill Swartz, 
I can’t help but hold those push-
ing for prosecution at least a little 
bit responsible.
Swartz was a clearly ?awed 
yet undoubtedly brilliant man. In 
his short life, he founded RSS and 
helped deter the Stop Online Pi-
racy Act (SOPA); he will be greatly 
missed in both the tech and political 
activism communities. Rest assured 
that, while he may be gone, there 
are many left who will continue to 
advocate for greater transparency 
and protection of the open Web, if 
perhaps in a manner less likely to 
lead to direct confrontation or ha-
rassment.

Fiscal progress rests on work, perseverance
KYLE HENSON
With the quasi-resolution of the 
?scal cliff comes new taxes for every-
one. Some of Obamacare’s 19 taxes 
are starting to kick in. The payroll tax 
cut expired, and some new taxes on 
the wealthy, such as the expiration 
of the Bush Tax Cuts and an addi-
tional 0.9 percent payroll tax for high 
earners as part of Obamacare, were 
allowed to take place. 
The increased tax burden on the 
wealthy, driven entirely by the wishes 
of Democratic lawmakers, brings to 
light the contrasting views that Dem-
ocrats and Republicans have about 
the economy, especially considering 
that those tax increases hardly put a 
dent in the federal de?cit.
Imagine that the economy is com-
prised of 10 bakeries, each making 
10 pies a year for a total of 100 pies. 
Those pies represent gross domestic 
product, or all taxable income. If the 
pies were distributed like income in 
the U.S. economy, the top 20 percent 
would get 50 pies and the bottom 10 
percent would get only one pie, ac-
cording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 
2007 Economic Survey of income 
data. Democrats and Republicans 
agree that this is a problem, yet they 
have two very different ways to go 
about solving it.
Democrats subscribe to what is 
being called “The Blue State Model,” 
which involves redistribution. They 
want to take more pies from the top 
20 percent and give them to the bot-
tom 20 percent.
Republicans don’t believe that 
this is effective or right. What Repub-
licans want to do is get the govern-
ment out of the way and help more 
people get into the workplace so 
that bakeries can make 11 pies each 
or possibly an 11th bakery can be 
opened.
These are policies and strategies 
that grow the economy, creating 
more pie for everyone, making us 
all better off. The Democratic Par-
ty’s approach discourages economic 
growth. 
Naturally, if you’re waking up ear-
ly and spending all day making pies 
only to have them taken away from 
you, you’ll probably wake up later, 
not make as many pies, and choose to 
spend more time doing economically 
unproductive things.
This is the big debate of our time. 
Republicans need to shift their pitch 
from defending the rich to recogniz-
ing that income inequality is a prob-
lem that needs solving. 
We can solve it by creating more 
pies for everyone to eat, including 
those at the bottom.
The Democratic model never ac-
tually solves this problem. The rich 
can only foot so much of our nation’s 
growing bill. The real taxable money 
is in the middle class and upper-mid-
dle class, people whom both parties 
claim to protect. History has shown 
us that once entitlement programs 
start, they keep growing to an unsus-
tainable level. When you can get free 
money, why wouldn’t you take it? 
Eventually, the money to fund them 
is going to have to come from these 
less-well-off people.
After winning legislative victories 
that got more pies to working people, 
Samuel Gompers, a labor movement 
leader of the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries, was asked, “Well now that 
you’ve won, what do you want?” He 
replied, “More.” 
This is exactly what happens to 
entitlement programs. Everyone just 
wants more of other people’s pies 
until there aren’t enough of other 
people’s pies to give out. The people 
making the most pies stop working as 
hard, and the economy shrinks.
It’s time to help the poor by hav-
ing an opportunity-focused society, 
not an entitlement society. It’s time 
for Republicans to re?ne their pitch 
to re?ect this intent.

Men’s, women’s track teams 
sprint to preseason success 
ELIZABETH MARTIN
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s and women’s track and 
?eld teams competed in the 
Al Hall Freedom Games on 
Saturday against NCAA Divi-
sion- I, II, and III schools at 
Edinboro University. This was 
the ?rst meet of the season, 
and was unscored. 
Several men and women 
on the teams had strong per-
formances that set the bar 
high for the rest of the track 
season.
Sophomore Nathan Cheek, 
the 2011 UAA Indoor Track 
weight-throw champion and 
Carnegie Mellon football 
player, placed ?rst in the 
weight throw  with a throw of 
15.46 meters.
Several of Cheek’s fellow 
teammates also had excellent 
performances. In the high 
jump, ?rst-year Mike McDer-
mott cleared the 2.00 meter 
bar to place second.
Junior Daniel Cardenas 
Rivero represented Carnegie 
Mellon well in the pole vault-
ing event, clearing a height of 
4.25 meters, placing second 
in the event. The running 
events also saw their share of 
strong performances.
In the 800-meter event, 
sophomore runner Douglas 
O’Connell ?nished second 
with a time of 1:57:89. In the 
3,000-meter event, sopho-
more George Degen ?nished 
second with a time of 8:37.46.
“I was proud of the way 
that we ran on Saturday. A 
lot of our guys came close to 
or matched their best marks, 
which is very promising, con-
sidering it was our ?rst meet. 
We had strong performances 
across many events, in both 
running and throwing. The 
throwers especially look like 
they are going to have an awe-
some season,” Degen said. 
“I’m excited for our team’s po-
tential this season.”
On the women’s side, 
sophomores Halley Bayer and 
Erin Kiekhaefer, and ?rst-
years Erin Persson and Jillian 
Jaycox ?nished ?rst in the 
4x800-meter relay in a time of 
10:13.74. 
“It was a great way to start 
of the season,” Jaycox said. 
“Pain is temporary, pride is 
forever.”
In the 60-meter hurdles, 
junior Jacqueline Guevel, a 
2011 All-American recipient, 
?nished second with a time 
of 9.27. 
In the 60-meter dash, ?rst-
year Jenna Asperslag raced to 
a fourth-place ?nish, with a 
respectable ?rst-meet time of 
8.35 seconds.
Sophomore Sasha Spald-
ing sprinted to a fourth-place 
?nish with a time of 27.18. In 
the 3,000-meter race, junior 
Elise Hall’s time of 10:51.48 
placed her third in the event. 
Senior Emily Wobb dou-
bled up by running both the 
mile and the 800-meter run, 
placing third and fourth with 
times of 5:23.31 and 2:32.90, 
respectively.
“The best part was getting 
a preview of what the next 
week’s workouts are going to 
be like from the paces ran, dis-
tances thrown and the heights 
jumped,” Wobb said. “It was a 
great meet.”
The next competition for 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
and women’s track and ?eld 
teams is the Denison Lid-Lift-
er on Saturday in Granville, 
Ohio.
Tartans fall to 0–4 in UAA
GABRIELLE WEST
Sports Co-Editor
The Tartans men’s basket-
ball team were defeated by 
the No. 1-ranked University of 
Rochester and the No. 3 Em-
ory University this past week-
end. Their record now stands 
at 3–13 overall and 0–5 in 
conference.
Friday night, the Tartans 
faced the University of Roch-
ester Yellowjackets at home. 
The game started out as 
a battle for the lead with 
constant buckets from both 
teams. Sophomore guard Seth 
Cordts was a major player for 
the Tartans’ offense, contrib-
uting to the team’s ?rst four 
points. 
After the score was tied at 
nine, the Yellowjackets went 
on a run with a score of 20–18 
with 10 minutes remaining 
in the ?rst half, until junior 
forward Rob Mohen made a 
three-pointer to take the lead.
Rochester answered with 
a jump shot, regaining the 
lead for another nine minutes 
while the Tartans ?lled the 
gap. 
They eventually took the 
lead at the end of the half 
from a three-pointer taken by 
junior guard Asad Meghani.
The second half opened 
with a tied score off of a three-
pointer from the Yellowjack-
ets who later took the lead 
and never looked back. 
The ?nal score was 72–63. 
The Tartans shot 43 percent 
from the ?eld and 45.8 per-
cent from beyond the arc.
The Tartans’ next oppo-
nents were the Emory Univer-
sity Eagles. 
The Eagles started off on 
?re and progressed the score 
to 20–9 until Meghani made a 
three-pointer. 
This spurred the Tartans to 
an 11–6 run to bring the de?-
cit to six points after a three-
pointer from sophomore 
guard Jason Blakney. 
The half was hard fought, 
but Emory was able to end the 
Tartan run and ?nish the half 
with a score of 52–37. 
The second half was not 
much better for the Tartans, 
who weren’t able to stop the 
Eagles offense. They scored 
95 points to the Tartans’ 70.
Over the winter break, the 
Tartans scored wins against 
Bethany College and LaRoche 
College, but have not been 
able to carry these sucess-
es over to their conference 
games.
“As competitive as the UAA 
is, we have the ability to do 
well the rest of conference 
games and we have the ability 
to ?nish this season strong,” 
Cordts said.
The Tartans will play at 
home against Washington 
University in St. Louis this 
Friday at 8 p.m. and against 
the University of Chicago next 
Sunday at 2 p.m.

After months of waiting, 
hockey in all of its blades of 
glory — has ?nally returned 
to the Steel City.
The NHL kicked off its 
season Saturday after end-
ing a nearly four-month-long 
lockout. This reduced season 
schedule has shrunk the nor-
mal 82-game season mara-
thon to a short 48-game 
sprint to the playoffs. 
Due to the shortened 
season, brief training camp, 
integration of new person-
nel, learning of new coach-
ing schemes, and regaining 
of lost conditioning, this 
should be an exciting season.
Last season’s poor play-
offs performance, at the 
hands of division rival Phila-
delphia Flyers, left a bitter 
taste in the mouths of fans 
and players.
Now, the Pittsburgh Pen-
guins are ready to avenge 
last season’s disappointment 
and make a run deep into the 
playoffs. Hopefully, they will 
skate away at the end of the 
season with another Stanley 
Cup. 
While the roster has un-
dergone a bit of a shake-up, 
the Pens are still led by their 
top-tier centers, last year’s 
MVP Evgeni Malkin and 
perennial all-star Sidney 
Crosby. With Crosby being 
healthy for a full off-season, 
Pittsburgh should ?nally 
have both of its stars peaking 
at the right time. 
A main cause for the 
Pens’ collapse to the Flyers 
at the end of last season and 
into the playoffs was goalie 
Marc-Andre Fleury’s poor 
performance.
At the top of his game, 
Fleury is one of the best 
goalies. But when he’s off 
his game, Fleury becomes a 
major liability for Pittsburgh. 
Not even the Pens’ of-
fense can consistently com-
pensate for all the goals he 
lets in. To put some pressure 
on Fleury, the team traded a 
seventh-round draft pick for 
Tomas Vokoun, who started 
last season in goal for the 
Washington Capitals before 
losing his starting job half-
way through the season due 
to injuries. 
At 36, there are questions 
about Vokoun’s ability as an 
everyday starter if Fleury 
gets injured or does not per-
form. This long off-season 
and rushed preseason has 
done nothing to ease the 
concerns with Vokoun’s 
playing ability.
The primary off-season 
move for the Pens took place 
back during the summer. 
Third-line center James Sta-
al was traded to the Carolina 
Hurricanes for a package in-
cluding center Brandon Sut-
ter. 
While Staal is a much 
better player, his desire for 
a larger contract combined 
with Pittsburgh’s well of tal-
ent at the center position led 
to the Pens’ decision to trade 
him in return for younger 
players and future draft 
picks. 
Sutter is a very good 
third-line center, but he 
could face problems if Mal-
kin or Crosby gets injured 
and he is called on to ?ll in. 
He hasn’t proven to be the 
most reliable player thus far.
Overall, the Pens’ plays 
are very similar to those of 
last year, distinguished by 
yet another high-scoring of-
fense led by a front line of 
Malkin and forward James 
Neal, a solid above-average 
defense, and question marks 
in goal. 
Scoring has never been 
the Pens’ problem, and it 
seems unlikely to start now, 
especially with Malkin com-
ing off winning the Art Ross 
trophy as the league’s scor-
ing champion.
The team’s offense should 
also be led by Crosby, who 
will play in his ?rst healthy 
season since dealing with 
lingering concussion symp-
toms that cost him the bet-
ter part of the previous two 
seasons.
But while all that ?repow-
er will carry Pittsburgh into 
the playoffs, how far they go 
will be placed solely at the 
hands of Fleury and Vokoun. 
Unless Fleury recaptures his 
old form or Vokoun starts 
playing as good as he has 
his whole career, the Pens 
are looking at another early-
round exit. 
This team’s playoffs hope 
lives and dies with its goal-
tending. No matter how 
many times the offense can 
save, it will be fruitless if 
Fleury cannot stop the puck.
Women’s basketball team struggles to keep lead in conference matches
ELIZABETH MARTIN
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s basketball team suffered 
two losses this past weekend: 
one to Emory University yes-
terday and again to the Uni-
versity of Rochester last Fri-
day.
During a home double 
header, the University of 
Rochester Yellowjackets won 
in overtime 67–60, making 
the Carnegie Mellon women’s 
team record 10–5 overall and 
2–2 in University Athletic As-
sociation (UAA) play. 
Junior Jacquie Shaw 
proved to be a major asset 
for the game, scoring her ca-
reer high total of 31 points 
throughout the game. 
After the ?rst seven min-
utes of the game, the Yellow-
jackets led 14–4. Carnegie 
Mellon gained more points, 
but not enough. At halftime, 
the score was 34–15 in Roch-
ester’s favor. 
The Tartans scored 16 
points to almost tie the game 
45–44, then Shaw led the 
team so that the Tartans were 
ahead 50–48 with around ?ve 
minutes left. The University 
of Rochester women’s team 
fought back, but Shaw proved 
herself once again and was 
able to even the score to 55–55 
before overtime. During over-
time, University of Rochester’s 
player Loren Wagner gained 
the lead for the Yellowjackets, 
and teammate Jackie Walker 
extended the lead to the ?nal 
score of the game 67–60. 
First-year Lindsay Poss was 
also a major player for Carn-
egie Mellon, scoring 10 points 
for the Tartans. 
Otto also put up a remark-
able 13 rebounds in the game. 
Shaw re?ects that the week-
end “shows what we’re ca-
pable of and will only make us 
better.”
Sunday’s game against 
Emory was constantly back 
and forth in the ?rst half, 
with Carnegie Mellon lead-
ing by as much as ?ve points. 
Senior Emily Peel, ?rst-year 
Liza Otto, and sophomore 
Chandler Cau?eld all helped 
cut point de?cits whenever 
the Tartans were down during 
the game.
The game proved to be a 
nail-biter. Emory led the en-
tire second half, until sopho-
more Gabrielle West scored 
nine of her team-high 14 
points in the last two minutes 
to tie the game, only to be shot 
back to a ?nal score of 66–64 
as Emory’s Misha Jackson 
scored at the buzzer.
The two losses this past 
weekend put the Tartans re-
cord to 2–3 in the UAA confer-
ence and 10–6 overall. Over 
winter break, the team posted 
big wins against Westminster 
College, Chatham University, 
Case Western Reserve Univer-
sity, and Brandeis University.
The Tartans will take on 
Washington University in St. 
Louis next Friday at home at 
6 p.m.

Club water polo hopes to make splash
VINAY VISWANATHAN
Junior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon Men’s 
Water Polo Club team looks 
to make a splash this year by 
expanding their team and em-
phasizing team-building.
Last December, the squad 
represented the Mid-Atlantic 
Division at the 2012 National 
Collegiate Club Champion-
ship in Middlebury, Vt. 
First-year mechanical en-
gineering and business ad-
ministration double major Ted 
Warhoe, a utility player, said, 
“We were just very happy to 
be there. Most other teams at 
nationals had a full team on 
the bench, when we only had 
one substitute.”
Even without a full team, 
they exhibited a strong per-
formance at the Mid-Atlantic 
Championships at Franklin 
& Marshall College, despite 
playing without any substi-
tutes. 
Club president Willy El-
more, a junior civil and envi-
ronmental engineering and 
engineering and public policy 
double major, said, “Consid-
ering we were rebuilding, it 
was pretty awesome that we 
competed at the national level 
at the Division-III club tourna-
ment.”
The team worked hard, at-
tending three tournaments 
and the Division-III National 
Championship in the fall se-
mester. 
With an overall record of 
5–6, the team posted big wins 
against Bloomsburg Universi-
ty of Pennsylvania, Grove City 
College, Lehigh University, 
and Franklin & Marshall Col-
lege throughout the season. 
Looking forward into the 
spring, Elmore plans on ex-
panding the size of the team, 
hopefully supplementing sub-
stitute players to the seven 
main positions in water polo.
“Right now we don’t have 
a whole lot of players and not 
a whole lot of subs at tourna-
ments, and I want to go far-
ther at the national tourna-
ment than we did this past 
year,” Elmore said.
In terms of learning from 
the fall season, he said that he 
had “no regrets,” but hopes to 
improve “team chemistry and 
thinking as a team.”
Many of the players in the 
club come from backgrounds 
in high school water polo and 
competitive swimming, with 
some graduate students hav-
ing played at the collegiate 
varsity level. 
One of these players is bio-
medical engineering graduate 
student Miki Silver, a current 
player in the hole set position 
whom the team is attempting 
to replace after his graduation 
this spring.
“Anyone can come play,” 
Silver said. “All you need is a 
positive attitude and willing-
ness to work hard.”
The team’s plan for the 
spring semester is to contin-
ue lifting, swimming, going 
through dry-land exercises, 
and having players improve 
their game by experimenting 
with different positions. 
The team only has the pool 
three times a week, but has 
already begun intense prepa-
ration and team-building for 
next season.
“As a team we hang out on 
the weekend all the time and 
we’re a pretty close bunch of 
students. It’s really more than 
a team, it’s a group of friends 
as well,” Elmore said.
Warhoe agreed, “We all 
support each other; we really 
are a family.”
SPORTS COMMENTARYGoaltending is key to Pens’ success
ATHLETE PROFILEFirst-year Liza Otto brings points, positivity for team
ABBY SMITH
Sports Co-Editor
Although many would rec-
ognize her as the sweet, smiling 
?rst-year girl strolling around 
campus, few others know of Liza 
Otto’s basketball prowess. 
Otto, despite being in the 
middle of what she calls “the 
tough transition period to col-
lege basketball,” has helped lead 
the Tartans’ women’s basket-
ball team to their best record in 
years, with an overall 10–6 re-
cord.
For the past 10 seasons, the 
best the Tartans have performed 
in the University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA) Conference has 
been 2–12 for the entire season, 
making their overall winning re-
cord so far a major accomplish-
ment. 
Otto has been a top-contrib-
uting starter to the team, recent-
ly leading victories over Case 
Western University and Brandeis 
University. 
In Friday’s game against the 
University of Rochester, Otto 
achieved a career-high 13 re-
bounds for the Tartans.
On Dec. 29 last year, Otto 
scored 12 points and 10 re-
bounds to achieve her second 
double-double of the season. 
Otto has been one of the 
team’s most consistent top scor-
ers this year, scoring 13 points in 
their most recent game.
She is currently ranked  in 
several categories in the UAA  
conference, which include total 
points, rebounding, assists, free-
throw percentage, and blocked 
shots. 
Her teammates attribute her 
success to her positive attitude. 
“Liza has a hard-working at-
titude and poise on the court,” 
said senior captain Tori Bag-
gio. 
“She’s been such a positive 
force for the team so far,” said 
sophomore teammate Chandler 
Cau?eld.  “She is an integral part 
of our team.”
Hailing from Glastonbury, 
Conn., Otto certainly has had 
experience with the sport of bas-
ketball.  
She has played since she was 
seven years old, and said she 
loves “being part of a team with 
people that you can rely on and 
trust.”
Otto is currently in the Bach-
elor of Humanities and Arts pro-
gram. 
An architecture and psy-
chology major, said she loves 
the Carnegie Mellon team be-
cause of “team chemistry” and 
that the “program has provided 
[her] with stellar academics and 
a competitive level of basket-
ball.”
She said that although she 
was not sure what to expect 
coming into the season, know-
ing that the team was still 
growing and adjusting to a new 
coach, she has been surprised by 
the excellent team’s level of suc-
cess. Not only has Otto and the 
team had to adjust to the coach-
ing staff, but Otto herself has 
switched positions several times 
this season, playing everything 
from forward to guard.
Otto has been “humbled by 
[her] experience as a ?rst-year 
starter,” but remains focused on 
the team’s future goals.
“I hope we can make it to 
the conference championships,” 
Otto said. “I really think that 
we can leave our mark this sea-
son.”
Her teammates agree. “This 
is the best we’ve done in the con-
ference in a long time. We want 
to make a statement and show 
everyone that Carnegie Mellon 
is a new team and that we’re a 
force to be reckoned with,” Bag-
gio said. 
The new team hopes to cel-
ebrate itself by planning a sum-
mer trip to Europe, but for now, 
Otto and the Tartans will con-
tinue to work on improving their 
record and “making the most 
out of this season.”
Otto also emphasized the im-
portance of the coaches in the 
team’s success, and cited their 
efforts to make the season both 
rewarding and enjoyable. 
“They help motivate us a lot,” 
Otto said. “The assistant coach-
es, Tiff and Sarah, even reward 
us for making good plays  by giv-
ing us socks!”
Otto’s positivity, fun spirit 
and true love for the game is il-
luminated by her hopes for the 
rest of the season. “I think if we 
work hard enough, anything is 
possible,” she said. “We’re just 
that kind of team.”

From the hills of LA to CMU
Celebrity fashion and how to incorporate it in your style
Finding yourself in a fashion rut? If you’re uninspired 
by the fashion that surrounds you, a great way to 
find new ideas is to follow the style of the rich and 
famous. Celebrities are known for inspiring trends, 
and some are even defined by the way they dress.
The task of deciding which celebrities to imitate can 
seem daunting, since there are so many out there. 
This decision depends on your personal style. For 
some guidance, here is an overview of how three 
famous fashionistas dress and some tips on how to 
emulate their unique styles.
The first of these celebrities is a talented singer 
whose relationships are a constant focus not just for 
the media, but also for her music: Taylor Swift. Just 
as the genre of her music has been changing, Swift’s 
style has evolved a great deal over the past couple 
of months. Although her outfits could initially be 
described as vaguely preppy and vintage-inspired, 
sometimes with a bohemian influence, she has 
learned to successfully combine these elements to 
create her own look.
She is commonly seen wearing stripes, in the form 
of navy and white dresses and tops. In fact, an outfit 
pictured on the Taylor Swift Style blog features a 
dress such as the one described, paired with knee-
high socks and oxfords.
Swift also seems to be a fan of sweaters, in styles 
ranging from the classic cable knit to the famous 
fox sweater that launched the quirky animals-on-
sweaters trend. She usually wears these sweaters 
with jeans or pleated skirts. Blazers, blouses with 
Peter Pan collars, and patterned tights and jeans 
are other clothing items that embody Swift’s style. 
In terms of handbags, she is usually seen carrying a 
satchel.
Although she shares Swift’s penchant for preppy 
style, Harry Potter actress Emma Watson has 
a collection that is slightly classier and more 
sophisticated. Her most recent outfits almost always 
feature a scarf thrown over a sweater, worn with 
jeans and a pair of ballet flats. Watson is also skilled 
at adapting her floral skirts and summer dresses for 
the winter by pairing them with warm sweaters, 
tights, and boots in darker colors.
She seems to have embraced the recent trend of 
wearing shorts with tights; she was seen wearing 
this combination with a striped T-shirt and ballet 
flats while leaving a Starbucks on a sunny day 
in March of last year. She often adds an edge to 
more basic outfits with a leather jacket, as seen on 
dresslikeemma.net.
The style of the edgier fashions of Swift and Watson 
may not appeal to everyone; some may prefer the 
stud and cutout trends that became popular last 
year. Although she’s generally been off the radar 
since her dramatic haircut, Miley Cyrus is known 
for her edgy style. She tends to wear crop tops quite 
often, as seen on stealherstyle.net in which she pairs 
a gray cropped sweater with bright blue jeans, a 
varsity bomber jacket, and black Doc Martens.
Keeping with the edgy trend, a great deal of Cyrus’ 
outfits feature clothing embellished with studs and 
cutouts. She frequently incorporates graphic T-shirts 
or sweatshirts, as well as patterned leggings, as seen 
in pictures via Twitter that were also posted on the 
Steal Her Style website.
While celebrity style can be a great source of 
fashion inspiration, make sure you maintain some 
individuality. Mix and match the clothing items 
represented by the celebrity whose style inspires 
you for a look that’s all your own. Start with a basic 
striped T-shirt, jeans, and add a pair of oxfords to 
make it in the style of Swift. To emulate Watson’s 
style, switch the oxfords for ballet flats, and throw 
on a blazer and a scarf over the T-shirt. And finally, 
for fashion inspired by Cyrus, change your footwear 
again — this time in favor of Doc Martens — and 
swap the blazer and scarf for an oversized cardigan.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I have two roommates 
— let’s call them “Sam” 
and “Bruce.” Recently, 
Bruce claimed Sam 
is a more considerate 
roommate than I am. 
That’s a bunch of bull. I’m 
very considerate. I’m so 
considerate that I take a 
moment every couple of 
days just to stop and say 
to myself, “Wow, that was 
really thoughtful of you.” 
How can I make Bruce 
admit this? Sam has a 
smug look on his face. 
Thanks,

Dear ROOMIE,
We’re gonna get considerate 
all up in here. Order some 
delicious food, and then 
put it in some pots and 
pans so it looks like you just 
cooked it. Then say, “Oh, 
hey Bruce. I made all this 
delicious food, and I can’t 
eat it all myself. Would you 
like some?” Still not enough? 
Wait until five minutes before 
he gets home, and then 
start vacuuming somewhere 
prominent. “Oh, hey Bruce. 
Didn’t see you there. I was 
just doing some of my 
weekly cleaning.” Or, “Oh, 
hey Bruce. I just got this 
Groupon to the strip club 
across the street. I have 
to do homework all night, 
but the coupon is expiring! 
Why don’t you check it out 
and take all these singles 
with you?” Instantly most 
considerate roommate.
Or just keep not being 
considerate. That’s a lot 
easier,

Dear Patrick,
I’m a fan of going out 
to bars and dancing all 
night long. After so many 
years of dance lessons, I 
have some pretty sweet 
moves. The only problem 
is that the ladies seem to 
disagree. I break out my 
best moves, and they just 
head for the hills. Why 
don’t they like my hip 
gyrations?
Thanks,

Dear LEFT FEET,
Okay, let’s start with the 
basics. Step to your left, 
then your right. Repeat. 
Now, form fists with your 
hands and extend your 
pointer fingers. Wave them 
around in the air. If you want 
to mix it up, try holding a 
beer in one hand. If you’re 
feeling crazy, you can close 
your eyes and wave your 
head around, and if you’re 
limber enough, bounce in 
the air a little bit.
Once you’ve gotten 
everyone’s attention, it’s 
time to start dancing 
with someone. First, find 
someone you like. Then, 
awkwardly sidle up to them. 
Avoid eye contact at all 
costs. That way, you come 
off as mysterious. If things 
are going well, then dance 
around them in a circle like a 
leprechaun around his pot of 
gold. Guaranteed success; it 
never fails.
Actually it fails a lot,

To celebrate their parents’ wedding anniversary, people 
will usually take them out to dinner or give them a 
gift. But artist William T. Hillman decided to go a step 
further: He sponsored Yours Truly: Privately Collected 
Photographs, a photography exhibit at the Carnegie 
Museum of Art, in honor of his parents’ 67th wedding 
anniversary.
The exhibit is a collection of “some of the ?nest vintage 
photographic prints by some of the most admired 
photographers in the history of the medium,” according 
to an introduction by the museum’s director, Lynn 
Zelevansky, in a pamphlet provided to visitors. Indeed, 
the photographs are beautiful, and the clean design of 
the exhibit allows them to speak for themselves.
Unlike most exhibits, which have small plaques or 
labels accompanying each piece, these photographs 
only have small, nearly unnoticeable numbers quietly 
identifying them; visitors who want to know the title 
or photographer for each piece can check the provided 
pamphlet. That curatorial choice means that the true 
focus becomes neither the photographers nor the 
historical signi?cance of the works, but rather the 
photographs themselves and the message of love that 
most of them convey.
Near the entrance to the exhibit, for instance, Herb 
Ritts’ “Fred and Tatjana 3, Guadalupe” (1988) hangs next 
to Danny Lyons’ “Uptown (Young Couple)” (1965). The 
former is a sharp, close shot of a couple cavorting on 
the beach, wherein every grain of sand is visible on the 
couple’s bodies as “Fred” kisses an enraptured Tatjana.
In contrast with this steamy affair in paradise, “Uptown 
(Young Couple)” features a far more ordinary scene. It 
shows a young couple at a home full of everyday knick-
knacks, the woman’s hair still in curlers as the man leans 
in for a kiss. The pairing of the two photos creates a nice 
juxtaposition between the two types of love and reminds 
the viewer that everyday, domestic love is by no means 
less romantic or important than an island affair.
But to anyone reluctant about visiting an exhibit 
?lled with image after image of embracing couples, 
fear not: As Zelevansky writes, “[The photographs] 
comprise a meditation on the nature of love in its many 
forms.” While romantic love may be the main focus 
of the exhibit, there are several different forms of love 
represented. Familial love takes center stage in “Mother 
and Daughter, Brighton Beach, New York” (1985) by 
Rosalind Solomon, and “Summer, the Lower East Side” 
(1937) by Weegee (Arthur Fellig) captures pure joy as 
gleeful children play in the spray from a ?re hydrant.
There are some photographs that deviate from 
expressing any sort of love. Some work as a way to 
contextualize the other photographs: In one set of 
photographs, images of soldiers kissing their girlfriends 
goodbye at Penn Station in New York alternate with 
urban images of New York City from approximately the 
same time period. In another grouping of photographs, 
two landscape images help balance out images of people 
outside at the beach.
For a few of the photographs, the lack of accompanying 
explanatory text becomes problematic, as it was unclear 
as to why the photographs had been included in the 
exhibit. “Baby Beaton, Wanda Baille-Hamilton, Lady 
Bridget Poulett” (1920) by Cecil Walter Hardy Beaton 
portrays three women surrounded by what appear to be 
balloons, with no discernible connection to the exhibit’s 
theme.
However, these inexplicable deviations are, in the end, 
a minor ?aw in an otherwise beautifully organized 
exhibit. Perhaps the most powerful examples of the 
exhibit’s message are the images selected to bookend 
the exhibit. The ?rst photograph at the entrance of Yours 
Truly, “Paris 1949 New Year” by Robert Frank, shows 
a man holding a single tulip behind his back, ignoring 
passersby as he waits to surprise someone with the 
?ower.
The exhibit’s last photograph is the only color photo in 
Yours Truly and the only image from the 21st century. It’s 
a framed copy of the Dec. 1, 2012 issue of the New York 
Times. The front page features a photograph by Brennan 
Linsley, in which a returning soldier ?ercely kisses his 
tearful wife, their 14-month-old daughter looking on.
Anticipation in 1949, joyful reunion in 2012: There is 
no better way to prove that, as Hillman writes at the 
beginning of the exhibit, “True love is eternal.”

On Remixes
Over winter break, one of my friends downloaded a bunch 
of one-hit wonders. It did not take long, however, to ?nd 
that someone decided that gems such as “Who Let the 
Dogs Out?” and “Cotton-Eyed Joe” needed remixes.
These remixes were not just bad — there was also no 
new perspective gained from listening to them. There 
was barely anything about the songs that was altered; 
hi-hats, bass, and synths were simply added on top of the 
songs with some minor equalizer manipulation. It was the 
musical equivalent of using Microsoft Paint to do photo 
manipulation.
Good remixes have a lot in common with good song 
covers: They maintain the most essential aspects of 
the song, provide a new perspective, and show an 
appreciation of the source material. For example, I was 
never a fan of Lady Gaga’s “Yoü and I.” However, after 
hearing Wild Beasts’ remix of it, I changed my opinion.
Wild Beasts’ remix stripped away almost every element 
of the song, leaving a vocal loop of Lady Gaga singing, 
“This time we made love / This time baby you and I,” 
over sampled loops taken directly from the song. The 
only addition the band makes is singer Hayden Thorpe 
moaning over parts of the song. The two layers of the 
song could not sound any more different. Wild Beasts 
stripped away the theatricality, the radio-pop polish, and 
the schmaltzy country-rock ballad feel. They left listeners 
with the soul of the song: sexual longing and the torture of 
being separated from a loved one.
It’s easy to discredit remixes as a legitimate art form 
because it’s not terribly dif?cult to make one. But artistic 
vision is necessary to make a remix worth listening to. 
Although there are enough mediocre dubstep remixes 
of pop songs to make one lose faith in remix culture, it’s 
important to remember that if you just keep looking hard 
enough, you’ll probably ?nd a remix that will remind you 
why you started looking for them in the ?rst place.

Phipps presents vibrant show
Orchid and bonsai tree exhibit informs and captivates
Trunk splitters, root hooks, and concave cutters, oh 
my! The Orchid and Tropical Bonsai Show, which 
opened Jan. 12 at Phipps Conservatory, offers guests 
the chance to do much more than just observe 
orchids and bonsai trees. The exhibit includes 
information on the history and location of these 
plants, the science and techniques behind how they 
are grown, and opportunities to grow your own at 
Phipps.
Bonsai is the Japanese art of training small trees 
to take on the shape and style of their larger 
counterparts that occur in nature. The word “bonsai” 
can be broken down into “bon,” which means “tray 
or lowsided pot,” and “sai,” which means “a plant 
or plantings.” These miniature trees emulate some 
trees that have spent hundreds of years in the wind, 
and others that stand upright with twisting, far-
reaching, above-ground roots.
The “Sunken Garden” room is ?lled with a variety of 
miniature bonsai trees, including the willow ?g leaf, 
Japanese pittosporum, and Chinese banyan, among 
many others. The small trees all look vastly different 
and give guests the chance to see different styles 
of bonsai trees up close. Bonsai artists in the area 
worked on some of the trees, other trees were gifts 
to Phipps, and some were used in previous exhibits. 
The variation in size, style, age, and technique 
makes exploring the room both educational and 
entertaining. The ?nal part of the exhibit explains 
the basics of bonsai, such as what tools are used and 
how the trees are made to look the way they do.
The orchids in the show are spread far and wide 
throughout Phipps. Some are integrated into 
existing exhibits in the form of hanging baskets and 
small planters. Others are planted directly into the 
exhibits, along with informational and educational 
placards to teach guests more about these brightly 
colored plants. For example, did you know that 
orchids grow on every continent except Antarctica? 
Or that they are the largest and most varied family of 
?owering plants in the world? Or that there are over 
30,000 known species of orchids?
Laboratory equipment is on display in order to show 
patrons how the plants are engineered to have 
different colors, be different sizes, or even bloom in 
different shapes. The combination of home-grown 
and lab-grown orchids exposes guests to a wide 
variety of the plants in many different contexts. 
The bright pinks, purples, and yellows of the orchids 
juxtapose nicely with the rich greens and browns of 
the bonsai trees. Just as the colors complement each 
other, so do the different techniques for growing 
each type of plant.
The choice to combine these two exhibits into 
one show makes for an educational and visually 
appealing stroll through Phipps Conservatory. And 
should either art form interest you, the classes 
for growing bonsai and tips for growing orchids 
offer guests the chance to engage more fully with 
the exhibit. Overall, the show has something to 
offer everyone — be it gardening tips, scienti?c 
exploration, or just the opportunity to admire 
beautiful plants.

For the professional actor, it’s rare and exciting to ?nd 
a role that unites both commercial and artistic success. 
But Carnegie Mellon alumnus Devin Ilaw (CFA ’07) 
believes he’s found that role.
Since graduating with a BFA in acting and musical 
theatre in 2007, Ilaw has landed a couple of major gigs, 
playing Thuy in Miss Saigon and appearing on Late 
Night with Conan O’Brien.
But his role as Marius in the PNC Broadway Across 
America tour of Les Misérables, which is now playing 
at the Benedum Center in Pittsburgh, is by far the most 
signi?cant.
Thomas Douglas, Ilaw’s former vocal coach and an 
associate teaching professor of voice at Carnegie Mellon, 
had con?dence in him from the onset. While working 
with Ilaw on a School of Drama project, “it was clear 
to me then, that he was a very special young man,” 
Douglas said in an email. “I’m not at all surprised to hear 
of his varied successes in the professional world.”
As an actor on a Broadway tour, Ilaw must undertake 
a daunting task every time he arrives in a new city. 
According to him, the actors on tour never have time to 
rehearse in the theater where they actually perform — 
aside from the sound check that occurs only two hours 
before the show.
Surprisingly, Ilaw is able to take this challenge in stride. 
“It’s less nerve-wracking,” he said in an interview. “It’s 
more that you learn to trust the people around you. Trust 
your show, trust the theater.”
The traditional Broadway favorite has recently garnered 
even more attention because of last month’s release 
of the ?lm adaptation. Les Misérables tells the story 
of criminal-turned-mayor Jean Valjean and his efforts 
to evade the pursuit of a vindictive policeman, set 
against the tragic backdrop of the French Revolution. 
In the Broadway Across America production, Ilaw plays 
Marius, a young revolutionary who falls in love with 
Valjean’s adoptive daughter.
Despite having spent more than ?ve years in the 
professional acting business, Ilaw still attributes many 
of the skills he uses onstage to his School of Drama 
education. “The program is so grueling, it teaches you to 
be everything and anything,” he said. “It taught me how 
to be an artist.” Malleability as an actor is a fundamental 
skill he learned at Carnegie Mellon and continues to use 
in his pursuits as a professional actor.
Ilaw uses those skills every time he gets onstage to keep 
his performances fresh and interesting for his audience. 
But breathing life into each performance isn’t just for 
the audience’s sake. For Ilaw, it’s crucial that actors 
continuously engage with their roles: “As an artist, you 
don’t want to be bored.”
Ilaw further underscored the importance of constant 
discovery for young actors. “Make new discoveries all 
the time,” he urged. Part of the wonder of interacting 
with fellow actors, Ilaw said, is not only making 
discoveries about yourself, but also seeing new qualities 
in other actors. “Try to ?nd those epiphanies,” he said — 
then, correcting himself: “Try to allow the epiphanies to 
happen.”
Ilaw believes the best epiphanies happen when the true 
qualities of an actor shine through in a performance. He 
prides himself in particular on “always bringing myself 
to a role … ?nding elements of me in a character.” In this 
way, Ilaw urges young actors to “be true to yourself” — 
to allow personal qualities to emerge both onstage and 
off, whether in character or not.
However, Ilaw doesn’t rely solely on himself for guidance 
in a role. In his role as Marius, he draws heavily from the 
Victor Hugo novel, upon which the musical is based, for 
inspiration and af?rmation. He carries a brown, worn, 
leather-bound notebook ?lled with quotes from the book 
and other notes, which he occasionally pulls out for 
reference. “I always go back to the book,” he said.
Although Ilaw is proud of certain aspects of his work, 
he still strives to challenge himself in other areas. As 
an artist, Ilaw said, “It’s hard to be happy with your 
work.” While to an extent, Ilaw does consider himself a 
perfectionist, he recognizes the need for imperfection 
in acting: “Perfection is not interesting.” Just as a 
character’s ?aws in a play or musical compel the 
audience, an actor’s imperfections add variety and 
spice onstage. Moving forward, Ilaw’s goals are simple: 
“Stay positive, stay happy, and keep myself artistically 
challenged.”
Looking to the future, he is casually optimistic; rather 
than pointing to speci?c career goals, Ilaw said he 
“can’t wait to see where the path is going to lead” — 
emphasizing that “I often let the path lead me.”
And overall, Ilaw is happy — especially with his current 
role in Les Misérables. “Commercial success doesn’t 
equal artistic success, but the hope is that they come 
together,” Ilaw said. “Les Mis really is it.”

Most of you probably remember the Polaroid camera: 
the little box with a lens on top that, when you clicked 
the button, spat out a little white card that hip-hop 
duo Outkast liked to shake a little bit before an image 
magically appeared. It was a popular, easy-to-use device 
that would eventually be phased out by the development 
of digital photography and mostly forgotten by the 
public. But artist Jeremy Kost is one person whose 
Polaroid camera isn’t sitting in a mountain of trash 
alongside your dad’s Sony Walkman and VHS copies of 
Beauty and the Beast.
Over the past few years, Kost has made a name for 
himself with his Polaroid camera, snapping images of 
everything from New York nightlife to celebrities and 
fashion models. For his ?rst solo museum exhibit titled 
Friends With Bene?ts, which is on display at The Andy 
Warhol Museum, Kost turned his little box with a lens on 
top to a group of Pittsburgh drag performers.
Almost exclusively displayed through Polaroid 
photograph collages, the exhibit is truly something 
else. The use of Polaroid images makes each photo feel 
distinctly human. Kost’s lens captures joy and sorrow, 
con?dence and insecurity, and the undercurrent of anger 
in the eyes and faces of those he photographs.
Kost’s photos raise questions on the nature of gender, 
beauty, and identity, and explore how mainstream 
America treats those who are different. The piece 
“Mirror, Mirror,” which depicts two drag queens in full 
makeup in front of a stone wall topped with barbed 
wire, illustrates the division in America regarding 
these ideas and the “wall” that is put up between the 
opposing viewpoints. A video in the exhibit depicts 
two performers going through their pre-show routine, 
applying the layers of mascara and wigs required 
for them to become their other selves. Or are they 
transforming from someone else into someone they really 
are?
Among these pieces of art, one gets a sense of the 
?uidity of sexuality and beauty and the looseness of 
these terms. Kost sees a beauty in these people who 
must turn to each other because no one else wants 
them. Underneath the painted faces and corsets, one 
can see that drag queens are just people with their own 
ideas about beauty and gender — people who believe 
that they are free to form their own identity.
The centerpiece of the exhibit, titled “Friends With 
Bene?ts (Communing With Andy),” is a large collage 
that encompasses nearly an entire wall of the room 
and depicts a number of the drag performers collected 
around the grave of Andy Warhol. Kost — who is 
frequently compared to Warhol and counts the pop art 
innovator as a major in?uence — may be making a 
statement in the spirit of his predecessor: Life comes in 
many colorful forms, as illustrated by the colorful drag 
queens against a backdrop of gray headstones and dying 
grass. Kost seems to say that we should celebrate this 
diversity rather than forcing everyone into drab, gray 
uniformity.
Kost’s camera captures these outsiders, who at ?rst 
look almost twisted and macabre, with great humanity 
and understanding. This affection prompts viewers 
to remember that, underneath it all, the subjects of all 
of Kost’s photographs are just people who want to be 
whoever they want to be.

End of Watch is one of the more thrilling 
cop ?lms released in recent years. 
Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña star 
in this portrait of two buddies in the 
LAPD. Writer and director David Ayer is 
probably best known for The Fast and 
the Furious and Training Day, but End of 
Watch proves to be his most impressive 
project. Gyllenhaal and Peña play patrol 
of?cers who get tangled up in some 
nasty South Central gang violence.

Ben Af?eck chooses some ?ashy Oscar 
bait for his third directorial feature. After 
turning in some legitimately impressive 
work with Gone Baby Gone and The 
Town, Af?eck directs and stars in Argo, 
a thoughtless but intense political 
thriller. The movie is loosely based 
on the Canadian Caper, a historical 
event during which the CIA faked a 
Hollywood production to extract six 
near-hostages from revolutionary Iran. 
The ?lm succeeds in direct proportion 
to how much it follows history, ?nding 
great moments in its outlandish, stylish 
suspense but failing when trying to milk 
the relevance cow.

In lieu of running an AB Films selection, 
the English department has organized 
a screening of To Be Heard, the debut 
documentary from Edwin Martinez. 
According to the Carnegie Mellon 
University Lecture Series website, “To 
Be Heard follows the life journey of three 
best friends who met in a high school 
poetry class in the Bronx, and make a 
pact to always support each other. Yet, 
when everything starts to go wrong and 
the road toward their childhood dreams 
becomes more perilous than ever, their 
hopes for the future and the strength of 
their friendship are put to the ultimate 
test.”

Ben Af?eck’s buddy, Matt Damon, stars 
in The Good Shepherd, another (albeit 
very different) story that misattributes 
several things to the CIA. Damon 
turns in a spectacular performance 
in this muddy historical tracing of the 
CIA. However historically dubious it 
may be, Robert De Niro’s direction 
makes The Good Shepherd a top-shelf 
political thriller for the ?rst hour. The 
script eventually bogs itself down in the 
fathers-failing-sons metaphor, but still 
maintains a solid level of juice. The ?lm 
is worth it for Damon’s performance 
alone, which is possibly the ?nest of his 
career.

Pittsburgh has a rich legacy of music. From trumpeter 
Roy Eldridge to Poison’s Bret Michaels, the Steel 
City has been the birthplace of in?uential artists in a 
spectrum of musical genres.
Through music collectives like VIA, Humanaut, Obvious, 
and now DETOUR, that legacy has endured and taken 
electronic dance music (EDM) under its wing. Although 
these groups are distinct, they work toward a collective 
goal: to revitalize the city’s music scene and rede?ne 
how its people party.
DETOUR, the newest music collective, aims to bring 
cutting-edge house and techno music to its peers while 
exploring the intersection of sight and sound. The 
group is comprised of six individuals, most of whom 
are or were Carnegie Mellon students and all of whom 
are involved in Carnegie Mellon’s radio station WRCT. 
These music enthusiasts are eager to expose their fellow 
classmates to new music in a safe space.
“There was no de?nite start,” Azis said. “We were all 
members of the [WRCT] radio station and were throwing 
regular parties for that, but we were limited to the CMU 
market. Pittsburgh is a rising star in music and techno in 
particular, and we wanted to be a part of that.”
DETOUR’s intent is to bring house and techno to a 
college student audience — “democratizing the techno 
scene,” as Azis put it. At the same time, the group wants 
to connect the younger generation with older audiences. 
“Humanaut, for instance, draws a big audience but 
largely plays at 21-and-over venues, and that really 
frustrated me as an underage student,” Azis said.
While he was banned from the 21-and-over crowd as 
an underclassman, Azis and longtime friend Alex Price 
found solace in swanky techno-themed house parties 
at their loft. With great titles like “Shut the Fuck Up: A 
Forest Techno Party,” and “Nocturne: A Winter Solstice 
Gathering” and excellent music, the parties were a 
success.
Wanting to create a space where those ages 18 and 
over could enjoy electronic music, DETOUR decided to 
collaborate with VIA. Lauren Goshinski, VIA co-founder 
and director and marketing and communications 
manager in the Carnegie Mellon School of Art, allowed 
the group to host parties at the new VIA-operated event 
space on 6119 Penn Ave. “Lauren Goshinski has really 
helped us by letting us have the space for parties,” Azis 
said. “She just wants Pittsburgh to have a great time.”
Although the space is farther away from the Carnegie 
Mellon campus than many students would venture for a 
show, Azis says, “The space is a ?lter. If you can get to 
it, that means you really want to be there.” Because 6119 
Penn Ave. is technically an event space, it has no of?cial 
closing time; in fact, a few DETOUR parties have gone 
on until 4 a.m.
The group’s latest event, titled Poupon in honor of the 
featured DJ of the evening, was held on Saturday and 
ran from 9:30 p.m. to about 3 a.m.
Poupon, a DJ and producer native to Toronto, headlined 
the event and played to a lively crowd from midnight to 
the close of the show. Sitting on an orange couch in the 
back-room reserved for staff, wearing black jeans, a black 
T-shirt, and slicked back hair, Poupon explained the 
reason behind his name.
“My mom has a cousin who’s nickname is Poupon; in 
French it’s sort of like a nickname that means babyface,” 
Poupon said. “When I was deciding what to call myself, 
I was taking a ferry to Toronto Island and I saw a boat 
that was named Poupon. It made me think of my mom’s 
cousin, and y’know I’m a big food guy too so I just 
thought I’d go for it. Looking back I probably would have 
picked a different name, but I’m kind of stuck with it 
now.”
If audience members didn’t have an af?nity for mustard 
before Poupon’s set, they most certainly did afterward. 
With Sharon Rubin and Chloe Lula opening for Poupon 
and Ben Tapas working the visuals, the crowd’s energy 
stayed high the entire night.
“A lot of clubs in the U.S. have a highly chauvinistic 
atmosphere; you go there to hook up or get

DETOUR, we’ve tried to dispel that atmosphere. At 
DETOUR, people are respectful when they party, and 
that has something to do with the space, the culture of 
the city, and the music.”
Poupon, who has been DJing since 2006, agreed that 
the atmosphere of a space can make or break a show. “I 
started at house parties like these guys, started playing 
at parties and getting booked at clubs, and if the crowd 
is there with an open mind, it’ll be a great show,” 
Poupon said. “The ideal crowd is one where you can play 
a whole set of songs that they don’t know and they’ll still 
dance just as hard as if they did know them. I’ve played 
at some ‘bottle service’ clubs and it’s packed, but people 
aren’t interested. Everyone’s in their own little world: 
They’re on their phones or trying to pick up a chick at 
the bar. They’re not actually there for the music.”
Using the 6119 Penn Ave. space, DETOUR has tried 
to make each party it throws unique. The group ?nds 
an artist to create different visuals for each show, 
projecting the images or movies behind the DJ. “The 
thing with more conventional clubs is you walk in 
and it’s essentially the same party every week, just a 
different DJ,” Poupon said. “So I really like spaces that 
are multifunctional and don’t have a static design and 
décor.”
Tabas, a University of Pittsburgh alumnus with degrees 
in ?lm, philosophy, and poetry, created the unusual 
triangle screens that hung behind the DJs at this 
Saturday’s DETOUR event. “I’m really bored with the 
idea of the screen — I think it engenders a passive 
viewership,” Tabas said. “For the Poupon show I wanted 
to shatter the screen and create a more engaging, 
jarring environment with video. We created a grid of 
triangles to look like the broken glass of a screen. I want 
the audience to think differently about the capacities of 
video — it doesn’t have to just be a square screen.”
The ?uidity that each DETOUR show strives for allows 
“people to experience something new: an awesome DJ 
they haven’t heard before or a visual installation that 
makes them think differently about viewership and the 
capacities of video,” Tabas said. “That’s what’s really 
exciting about DETOUR, how fresh and innovative it is. 
Every event will look new and fresh.”
Although DETOUR is still in the beginning stages, 
the group has big plans for its future in Pittsburgh. 
“Juan and I have been really interested in transitioning 
DETOUR into our own record label,” Azis said. “It’s 
ambitious and would take time to incubate, but we 
would like it to become a platform for people to make 
music in Pittsburgh. In the next six months or so, we’re 
going to have a lot of events coming up, a couple co-
branded with VIA and maybe Humanaut.”

After 27 years of music making, there is really only 
one question that accompanies the release of a new 
Yo La Tengo album: Will this be the Yo La Tengo that 
thrives in guitar freak-outs and stylistic eclecticism, 
or the Yo La Tengo that meticulously crafts gentle, 
quiet, introspective love songs? Regarding Fade, Yo 
La Tengo’s 13th album, the answer is a lot less trivial 
than it initially appears.
On ?rst listen, Fade seems to fall into the latter 
category. The album as a whole radiates serenity, 
even on the energetic high-point song “Well You 
Better.” Probably the tightest song on the album, 
it features almost-laconic sounding vocals from Ira 
Kaplan, perseverating on relationship issues over a 
looping rhythm section and off-kilter “wah-wahs.” 
Songs like “I’ll Be Around” and “Two Trains” most 
wholly capture the same hushed, late-night-car-ride 
atmosphere that Yo La Tengo has been channeling 
since the release of And Then Nothing Turned Itself 
Inside-Out.
It’s tempting to simply call Fade the logical 
successor to And Then Nothing and Summer Sun, 
but frankly it’s not. The stylistic assimilation and 
subtle instrumentation changes in Fade signal not 
simply a retread of the band’s post-2000 output, but 
an integration of the soft Yo La Tengo with the loud 
Yo La Tengo.
This can be seen from the very beginning of the 
album. “Ohm” begins with a percussive groove 
before Kaplan begins singing and adding in some 
reverbed guitar. Over the course of the song, the 
amount of feedback and noise gradually builds 
before becoming the most prevalent aspect of the 
song, which transforms not only the sound of the 
song but the implications of the lyrics. The phrase 
“So say good night to me / And lose no more time / 
No time / Resisting the ?ow” is repeated throughout 
the sonic dissonance. The signi?cance changes from 
narrative to an anchor of familiarity in the midst of 
an ever-changing soundscape.
Unfortunately, Fade does not feature any of the long-
form experimental tracks that have been a hallmark 
of the Yo La Tengo sound, which is part of the 
reason that this is the band’s shortest release since 
Fakebook in the 1990s. The noisy, extended jams of 
the band’s earlier albums were always captivating 
and rarely bloated. While the absence of these longer 
trackers from Fade is more than a bit disappointing, 
the focus on shorter, more self-contained songs has 
resulted in one of the indie stalwart’s most cohesive, 
consistent albums to date.
Fade is much like Dinosaur Jr.’s I Bet on Sky and The 
Mountain Goats’ Transcendental Youth in that there 
are no real surprises here. That is not only okay, but 
almost preferable. Yo La Tengo may have passed its 
creative apex, but the quality of its music has not 
decreased. This album is Yo La Tengo at the most 
comfortable it’s ever been with itself, and the fact 
that the band is still making enjoyable and exciting 
music after 27 years is venerable.
Even though this band was a key factor in shaping 
indie rock and the culture of college radio stations, 
it has never broken through to the mainstream. You 
probably won’t hear any of the album’s songs on the 
radio, but the legacy of the band that made it will 
outlast most any other artist currently making music.

The dean’s opening statement at a 
school-wide assembly was, “The great 
question is not whether ours is better 
or worse than other schools, but is it 
the best that we can make it....There 
is the Cornell type, the MIT type. What 
is to be the Carnegie type?” So 100 
years later, what has the “Carnegie 
type” become?

An editorial article argues that 
professors should empathize more with 
their students when scheduling exams, 
complaining that “the result may be 
three or even four exams in one day, 
and none receives the students’ best 
work.” Luckily, this degree of exam-
taking seems less common today.

A SciTech brief quotes scientist Emile 
Frison, who warns, “bananas may 
disappear within the next 10 years 
due to their lack of genetic diversity.” 
Bananas are one of the go-to side

they have survived despite Frison’s

Jennifer Gooch, a graduate student in 
the School of Art, created a website 
on which pictures of lost gloves from 
all over Pittsburgh could be posted, in 
the hopes that the missing glove could 
be reunited with its owner. Perhaps 
we should try using this system for 
Carnegie Mellon ID cards.

admitted to smoking marijuana.
