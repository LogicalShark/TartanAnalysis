Colleges deal with increased 
applicants ant^junprepared students
by Steven Spurgeon
Junior Staffwriter\
The number of students enrolling at four-year 
universities in the United States has risen 18 percent 
over the past 10 years, and will continue to rise, ac­
cording to the Chronicle of Higher Education’s 2005 
almanac.
That’s bad news for current and future high school 
students who will face higher admissions standards 
as colleges are flooded with applications.
According to Michael Steidel, the director of ad­
missions at Carnegie Mellon, “most students are 
submitting seven to nine applications now, compared 
to the past four to six.”
This comes at a time when the ACT, for­
merly the American College Testing Program, 
stated in an August press release that “too 
many students are not taking the right kind 
of courses in high school that prepare them for college 
and work.” The group reports that of all the students 
who took the ACT in 2005, only 21 percent were ade­
quately prepared to handle typical college demands.
The College Board, another educational testing 
organization, also reports that verbal scores on its 
well-known SAT exam have remained relatively stag­
nant since 1995, though the average math score has 
increased by about 10 points.
Part of 
the rea­
son lies with 
school systems 
that are unable to 
offer advanced pre­
paratory classes. As a 
result, as introductory 
physics professor Helmut 
Vogel puts it, there is a 
large population of stu­
dents who “are not well pre­
pared for the demands being 
thrown at them.” Although 
he says that most of the 
students he teaches have 
the ability to comprehend 
material, they come from 
a “very wide spectrum” of backgrounds, 
and sometimes lack in key areas.
When comparing students’ applications, most uni­
versities try to sort out these variances as best as they 
can. Carnegie Mellon uses a multi-tiered approach 
that includes several academic elements such as 
school rigor, recommendations, and standardized 
tests, in addition to grades. These categories make 
up only half of the decision; the rest is based on 
extracurricular activities, community contributions, 
and essays.
This makes it possible for the university to ac­
cept students with lower SAT scores, while denying 
admission to those with perfect test scores but no 
outside activities, explains Steidel.
However, the challenge of acceptance is only one 
of the obstacles facing students. Once enrolled at a 
college, students must make many adjustments in the 
way they work and live.
Professor Vogel believes. that one of the most 
important factors in such a transition is “learn [ing] 
to structure” social, academic, and extracurricular 
obligations. Students are constantly bombarded with 
a variety of activities and demands; combined with 
being away from home for the first time, these can 
be too much for some students to handle. Most col­
leges, including CMU, offer time-management and 
organizational classes aimed to ease students into 
college life.
Steidel also insists that a “good work ethic” is 
essential to performing well at any school. Students 
must be motivated and realize that college is a full­
time job, whether they like it or not.
Likewise, students should realize that failure is 
just as valuable as success: An occasional low grade 
should not be the end of the world, but should in­
stead serve as a hint of what to improve upon.
The challenges facing today’s students continue 
to rise, but one thing remains the same: Hard work 
still pays off.

Malcolm Forbes once said, “If you have a job with­
out aggravations, you don’t have a job.” It would 
seem that American university professors are prov­
ing him wrong, though: In a survey released last 
week, a majority of professors declared that they did 
not regret their career choice.
The survey, which was conducted by the Higher 
Education Research Institute at the University of 
California at Los Angeles, reported that 83 percent 
of professors would become professors again if they 
were given a new career choice. Fifty-five percent of 
those professors were particularly emphatic qbout 
that choice, 10 percent higher than reported 15 
years ago.
The Higher Education Institute interviews pro­
fessors every three years, and incorporates over
40,000 professors from both four-year and two-year 
schools.
In addition to professor satisfaction, the survey also 
incorporates political leanings, opinions the profes­
sors may have on their own institutions, and reasons 
for their career choice.
When .professors were asked what their career 
goals and perks were, the top answers included hav­
ing high financial security and “becoming an author­
ity in my chosen field,” according to The Chronicle of 
Higher Education.
The American Association of University Professors 
reported that in 2002 and 2003 the average annual 
salary for tenured professors was $86,437- For as­
sociate professors, it was $61,732, and for assistant 
professors, it was $51,545.
On the other hand, reasons such as making an 
impact on students and “influencing social values” 
were much less important to professors than in 
previous surveys.
Displaced 
students 
settle in
by Greg Hanneman 
& Shawn Wertz
Junior Stajfwriters
Three weeks after Hurricane 
Katrina forced the closing of sev­
eral universities in and around 
the city of New Orleans, displaced 
students from those institutions 
have resumed their studies else­
where, including here at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Prashant Sastry was an incom­
ing freshman when he arrived on 
the campus of Tlilane University; 
now he is one of 26 students from 
the affected area whom CMU is 
hosting. “As an incoming fresh­
man, you’re looking forward to 
coming to New Orleans for the 
two months beforehand,” he said. 
“Then all of a sudden, after being 
there for a matter of hours, we 
had to evacuate.”
Tulane freshman Kate Frankola, 
whose parents had already left 
New Orleans when Katrina struck, 
spent four days in a gymnasium in 
Jackson, Miss., with other stranded 
students before flying back to her 
native western Pennsylvania and 
enrolling at CMU.
“I never thought I’d be taking 
classes at CMU, but now I’m here,” 
she said.
CMU has opened its doors to 
students who hail from outside 
the Pennsylvania region as well.
“You guys are one of the few 
schools who would actually accept 
students who weren’t originally 
from around your area,” remarked 
Sastry, a Louisiana native. “The 
administration has been so help­
ful and really accommodating, 
though I don’t really know where 
anyplace is yet.”
Most of the visiting students 
didn’t arrive at CMU until 
September 6 and 7, midway 
through the second week of 
classes.
“It was a bit rough starting later 
than everyone else. Starting af­
ter Orientation definitely made it 
harder to make friends,” Frankola 
said.
The adjustment period has been 
full of mixed emotions, with some 
students finding the transition 
easier than others.
“Pittsburgh is amazing; the ar­
chitecture is amazing,” said Justin 
Frieg, a Tulane junior and me­
chanical engineering major. “I am 
from Florida, so it’s really nice 
to see something other than flat, 
swampy land. I love it; my adjust­
ment period was basically when
I got off the plane and got my 
bags.”

Economics department 
moves to Tepper School
by Brittany McCandless
Assistant News Editor
“Years of complaining and 
dissatisfaction from students” 
have induced a change at 
Carnegie Mellon, according to 
Student Services Coordinator of 
the Undergraduate Economics 
Program Carol Goldburg: Tepper 
School of Business will now 
house economics.
“I think it is good that basic 
economic principles and eco­
nomic research [are] going to 
be applied toward the business 
environment,” said senior eco­
nomics major Howard Jyhoon 
Han, “because frankly we don’t 
know what it’s going to be like 
in a year; we don’t know what 
it’s going to be like in two years. 
The market environment and 
what we think we know always 
changes.”
Han knows that succeed­
ing in business can be trying. 
He has recently returned to 
Carnegie Mellon to pursue his 
undergraduate degree after 
taking a few years off. As a full­
time student, Han also runs a 
full-time hedge fund business 
in New York.
“As a businessman, I view 
economics as crucially impor­
tant to the micro environment,” 
he said.
Carnegie Mellon faculty 
members agree. “There are 
many synergies between eco­
nomics and business,” said 
Goldburg.
Historically, the economics 
program was housed in the 
College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences (H&SS). 
However, most of the econom­
ics faculty consisted of profes-

Pennsylvania proposes minimum wage increase
by Dorian Adeyemi
Junior Staffwriter
Two weeks ago, Governor Ed 
Rendell announced his intention 
to increase the minimum wage 
of Pennsylvania by making in­
cremental changes from the cur­
rent federal level of $5.15. The 
minimum wage would increase to 
$6.25 by 2006 and $7.15 by 2007, 
with later possible increases if the 
standard of living goes up.
Governor Rendell made the an­
nouncement of this new initiative 
at a rally of labor unions and sup­
porters on September 5. Within 
Pennsylvania, about 254,000 
workers will benefit if the pro­
posal is enacted into law.
The governor has said he ini­
tially waited to let the federal gov­
ernment take action on the issue. 
However, the federal government 
did not act in accordance with

We thought endlessly about the 
firefighters who rushed into the build­
ings; I talked with my family about 
the selfless man who stayed with his 
wheelchair-bound friend in the build­
ing. After September 11, stories of 
hope, perseverance and camraderie 
soothed the nation’s battered soul. 
Now, after Katrina, we are in need 
again of great tales, but there are few 
such uplifting stories coming out of 
Katrina and its aftermath to match.
Perhaps reporters at the scene and 
editors in the newsrooms were so cap­
tured by the astonishing chaos that 
they were blind to the hopeful stories. 
Maybe the persisting ill communica­
tion between scattered people, unre­
liable cell phones, and offline email 
providers has prevented these stories 
from reaching the public eye.
But the stories are there: There are 
people across the globe who have 
donated a collective $867.3 million; 
thousands of people who have wel­
comed the refugees; and colleges and 
universities across the country that 
have made homes for the students 
who were displaced.
One post-Katrina story that is par­
ticularly inspiring to me is the perse­
verance exhibited by the leadership 
of the Hullabaloo, the student-run 
weekly newspaper of Tulane Univer­
sity.
On Saturday, I spoke to Kate Scha­
fer, the Editor-in-Chief of the Hulla­
baloo. “My personal goal is to try and 
publish online weekly,” she told me on 
Saturday.
Much like the staff of The Tartan, 
editors and writers of the Hullabaloo 
had returned to New Orleans early to 
produce and publish their first issue of 
the year. Even some new first-year stu­
dents had come early to get involved 
straight away. Their staff worked for 
two weeks and on Friday, August 26, 
the Hullabaloo’s orientation issue hit 
the stands across campus - just in 
time for the evacuation to begin.
“Our number one concern was 
safety,” says Schafer, who recognized 
that they could report on the story 
once the evacuation was complete.
The staff thought quickly. In spite 
of the confusion, the Hullabaloo’s 
business manager, Maggie Brook, was 
able to rescue the newspaper’s com­
puter server.
By the end of the day, everyone was 
gone.
Once the hurricane passed, the stu­
dents who make up Hullabaloo's staff 
scrambled to find host schools for the 
semester. News co-editor Christina Le 
says that now “our staff is fully dis­
persed across the nation.”
With Tulane’s e-mail out of service 
and New Orleans cellphones down, 
coordinating a staff must have seemed 
a daunting task. But from undamaged 
parts of Louisiana to London, staff 
members of the Hullabaloo sent mes­
sages via AOL Instant Messenger and 
the Facebook to Schafer asking for as­
signments.
Now attending the the Wharton 
School of the University of Pennsyl­
vania, where the staff of the Daily 
Pennsylvanian took her in, Schafer is 
working to organize a cohesive staff 
from people who are scattered across 
the country.
“We will be conducting online chat-' 
room meetings and keeping in contact 
as much as possible,” says Le. Their 
first meeting was Sunday night.
The Tartan’s Editor-in-Chief and I 
are very familiar with the complexity 
of coordinating a weekly newspaper 
with everyone on campus - and the 
ambition of the Hullabaloo editors 
amazes me. Their work will help fel­
low students by delivering to them a 
bit of normalcy.
“These students are across the 
country. It is our responsibility as 
the Hullabaloo ... to keep the student 
body together,” says Schafer.
On behalf of The Tartan, I offer any 
help we can give, and I applaud the 
staff of the Hullabaloo for upholding 
their mission to report the student 
news.

Hiking for Katrina Victims
CIT first-year Carlton Reeves and H&SS first-year Stephano Dubuc go for a run during the hike for

participated could have friends sponsor them for a dollar per mile.

Tulane students acclimate to CMU
TULANE, from A1
“I think it’s awesome. The fac­
ulty is definitely world-class. The 
professors seem to be very in 
touch with the students and ac­
tually care about them. Everyone 
has been going out of their way 
to make our stay comfortable,” 
he added.
First-year art major Arthur 
Leslie shared Frieg’s opinion. “I 
really like the professors a lot, 
and I think my favorite part of 
CMU is walking by CFA and hear­
ing people practice. It calms me 
and I love it,” he said.
Laurie Podskalny was one of 
the first of the visiting students 
to arrive on campus. “I was a 
little scared that no one would 
talk to me once I got on cam­
pus, that I would be ostracized 
in some sense,” she said. “But 
people have been really nice, and 
the professors have been amaz­
ing at being so accommodating. 
The people on my floor have 
been the best.”
Though many students men­
tioned a feeling of gratitude to­
ward CMU, some are still anxious 
to return south.
“I would definitely consider 
[staying at CMU], but I almost 
feel like I should go back. I feel 
like I owe Tulane a chance,” 
Sastry remarked.
“I was early action to Tulane, so 
you can imagine that I am com­
pletely determined to go back 
there,” Podskalny said. “My heart 
is there; Tulane is where I belong.” 
John Papinchak, CMU’s direc­
tor of Enrollment Services, said 
that all 26 students — 22 from 
Tulane, three from the University 
of New Orleans, and one from 
Loyola University — have been 
admitted for the semester as 
visiting students, the same status 
given to exchange students.
In order to continue their 
studies at CMU, “they will have 
to apply through the 
undergraduate admissions 
process just like any other 
transfer student,” he said.
Meanwhile, an online state­
ment posted Wednesday eve­
ning by Tulane president Scott 
Cowen stated that repair efforts 
at the New Orleans campus were 
progressing faster than antici­
pated.
“Based on everything I know 
today, Tulane University will be 
open this spring for our faculty, 
staff, and students,” Cowen 
said. “With things progressing 
so quickly, starting classes in 
January is realistic.”
But he also cautioned that 
classes would not resume until 
the safety of the area was assured, 
adding: “I do want to reiterate 
that no matter the progress we 
are making to restore the univer­
sity’s facilities, we will not start 
classes until it is absolutely safe 
to do so.”
Even with a future that remains 
uncertain, the character and 
determination of the students is 
ever present. “It’s nothing that I 
can’t handle,” Sastry said.
“These three months will be 
a test,” remarked Frankola, “but 
we’re slowly counting down the 
days.”
Economics department now in 
H&SS and Tepper Business School
MERGER, from A1
sors that worked in Tepper.
“It’s good for the economics stu­
dents — it’s what they wanted,” 
said Milton Cofield, executive 
director of the Undergraduate 
Business Administration.
“The thought was ‘Let’s give 
these students a home base,’” 
said Goldburg. “The real change 
in the student experience is that 
they now have somewhere to go: 
physically, emotionally, intellec­
tually.”
Now,, students wanting admis­
sion into the economics depart­
ment apply to H&SS as they have 
in the past. They remain H&SS 
students upon admission, until 
they are able to declare an eco­
nomics major halfway through 
their second semesters. Once 
students have declared an eco­
nomics major, they technically 
become students of both H&SS 
and Tepper. Faculty members in 
H&SS remain in charge of the stu­
dents’ general education require­
ments, while those in Tepper are 
put in charge of the economics 
program.
As part of the move, upper­
classmen who had already de­
clared an economics major were 
automatically made students of 
H&SS and Tepper. However, if an 
economics student transfers to 
any other H&SS major, he or she 
loses status as a Tepper student.
Similarly, to transfer to the 
business administration depart­
ment, an economics student 
must apply and be accepted into 
Tepper.
When economics students 
graduate, they are consid­
ered graduates of both schools. 
Although University diplomas no 
longer distinguish an individual’s 
college, transcripts do, according 
to Goldburg, which means eco­
nomic students’ transcripts will 
read both H&SS and Tepper.
According to Goldburg, eco­
nomics and business adminis­
tration programs remain clearly 
distinct. “They have different 
skill sets. They’re not the same 
students.”
Goldburg mentioned eco­
nomic curriculum development, 
a potential lecture series, and 
a campus-wide debate on out­
sourcing as possible programs in 
the future.
“Now that economics is in 
Tepper, Tepper is going to focus 
their energies in providing a very 
strong undergraduate degree. 
This is a win-win situation for the 
student,” Goldburg said.
Between 12 and 15 percent 
of H&SS students are primary 
economics majors, including ap­
proximately 85 upperclassmen. 
Six past Nobel laureates have 
been affiliated with the econom­
ics department.
First-years interested in the eco­
nomics program should contact 
Dr. Goldburg at unecad@andrew.

Pennsylvania may raise minimum wage two dollars
WAGE, from A1
Governor Rendell’s wishes. In 
March, when Congress passed an 
overhaul of the federal bankruptcy 
law, two amendment proposals 
by Senators Kennedy (D-Mass.) 
and Santorum (R-Pa.) to increase 
the minimum wage to $7.15 and 
$6.25, respectively, were voted 
down in the Senate. The last time 
the federal minimum wage was 
increased was in 1997.
Governor Rendell is no stranger 
to wage rate increases. In late 
July, he approved a controversial 
pay raise increase for members 
of the Legislature. Though he de­
clined to accept a pay raise him­
self, the increase has drawn sharp 
rebukes from all corners of the 
state. This has led many to accuse 
the governor of proposing a mini­
mum wage increase to mollify the 
objectors. But in an interview af­
ter the rally, Rendell denied that 
this was his intention.
However, Rendell has said that 
considering what the government
did in July, lawmakers should not 
consider a minimum wage hike 
“out of the question.” During the 
rally, Governor Rendell remarked, 
“If lawmakers can get a pay in­
crease, so can the poorest working 
Americans in Pennsylvania.” 
There is already a debate over 
the proposal. Business interests 
were predictably against it. Kevin 
Shivers, the Pennsylvania direc­
tor of the National Federation for 
Independent Business was quoted 
as saying, “We think if you’re 
going to raise the minimum wage, 
you might as well hand out pink 
slips with the paychecks.”
Labor feels that the current 
minimum wage is inadequate. The 
Pennsylvania AFL-CIO website 
reads: “The minimum wage has 
become a poverty wage. Someone 
who works 40 hours a week 52 
weeks a year for the minimum 
wage will make $5,000 less than 
what the federal government says 
is needed to keep a family of three 
out of poverty. A single parent 
with one child working the same
schedule will come up $2,000 
short.”
Previously, Governor Rendell 
had argued against raising the 
minimum wage. Although the last 
time the state raised the minimum 
wage was in 1988, Rendell feared 
that doing so before neighboring 
states would harm Pennsylvania 
competitively.
However, policy analysts ar­
gued that employers would still 
be permitted to raise wages volun­
tarily to keep workers and attract 
workers. Some of these fears have 
been quieted recently, as states 
like New York and New Jersey 
have increased minimum wages 
to $7.15 by 2007. These proposals 
would put Pennsylvania nearly on 
par with its neighboring states.
The question of the economic 
cost and benefit remains. Prior 
to the early 1990s the universal 
belief was that higher wages were 
positively correlated with job loss. 
But this belief changed somewhat 
after a 1994 study carried out at 
Princeton University by two econ­
omists. After a minimum wage 
increase there, they carried out 
a survey of fast-food restaurants 
and found that the amount of jobs 
increased.
Following their results, they 
put forth the theory that without 
the involvement of government, 
employers may have been paying 
amounts below a level necessary 
to avoid negative economic ef­
fects. They also suggested that 
employers offering higher wages 
may motivate their employees to 
perform better, contributing to 
less absences and better perfor­
mance. However, there remains 
data correlating a minimum wage 
increase and job losses.
The Post-Gazette reports that 
Rendell believes “people will say 
this will hurt our economy.... That 
clearly isn’t the case.” Supporters 
state that Pennsylvania’s econ­
omy is strong, and that higher 
wages will only increase its eco­
nomic strength. Only time will 
disclose the state’s future policy 
outcomes.

How Things Work: Highway Barriers
William Nicoll
You have somewhere to go. 
You jump in the car and ma­
neuver onto the nearest inter­
state. Whatever your destina­
tion, the National Highway 
System has probably helped 
you get there at some point. 
These highways allow, direct, 
fast, and safe movement across 
the country; however, the high 
level of safety we have today 
on our highway systems hasn’t 
come easily.
When designing highways, 
minimizing the severity of off- 
road accidents is important. 
Unlike in video games, stunt 
bonuses don’t exist, normal 
people don’t drive down the 
sidewalk, and your Honda 
Civic probably can’t take a 
shortcut off a bridge. Fatali­
ties resulting from these “road 
departures” can be reduced in 
several ways.
On highways, median bar­
riers between opposing traf­
fic reduce fatalities from road 
departures. A.highway-bound 
departure becomes especially 
dangerous in urban areas 
when the probability of hitting 
opposing traffic is high: More 
cars and less wiggle room 
means a lot more chances.
The concrete median may 
appear to be a simple construc­
tion, but these are no ordinary 
walls — they’re super walls! 
The goal here isn’t just to stop 
vehicles from entering oppos­
ing traffic. A giant pit between 
the lanes would accomplish 
that. Concrete medians pre­
vent median crossings, protect 
the occupants of the vehicle, 
minimize damage, and redi­
rect the errant vehicle back to 
where it belongs.
The New Jersey Turnpike 
Authority pioneered the “New 
Jersey shape” barrier, now ad-
optednationwide.Thebarrieris 
such that a> vehicle’s tire
will rise up on the shal­
low slope of the barrier’s
base, directing the vehicle 
away from the median in 
glancing collisions. When 
a vehicle collides at steeper 
angles, the steel-reinforced, 
barrier can absorb the force 
of a collision with a semi­
trailer without sending fly­
ing pieces of concrete into
surrounding traffic.
Fatalities from road de-
Sherry Chang/Art Staff
partures on the outer edges 
of highways result from hit­
ting trees, rollovers, and vari­
ous “road hardware” such as 
telephone poles, stoplights, 
and mailboxes. The most com­
mon roadside protections are 
W beams and cable barriers. 
W beams act as metal cushions 
that absorb impact by crum­
pling. Cable barriers deflect 
vehicles using wires tensed at 
each end.
Head-on highway collisions 
pose a new problem: Barriers
prove more deadly than ben­
eficial. Something is needed 
to bring the vehicle to a stop 
at accelerations tolerable to 
the passengers. John Fitch, 
a famous race car driver 
during the ’50s and ’60s, 
solved this prolem with 
the Fitch Highway Barrier 
System.
You might not know them 
by name, but you’ll probably 
recognize the yellow barrels 
with black lids sitting between 
highways and exit lanes. These 
sand-filled barrels are set up 
in rows along the most likely 
line of impact to a hazard. The 
vanguard barriers contain the 
most sand. Each successive 
barrel contains less. When a 
vehicle collides with the bar­
rels, they shatter, and the 
vehicle decelerates smoothly 
instead of violently hitting a 
barrier. Fitch barriers are used 
widely because of their cost ef­
ficiency and crash-worthiness.
There are many safety 
features in place to protect 
you on the highway, but 
remember that safety isn’t 
only engineering — education 
and awareness are just as im­
portant. So don’t drive drunk, 
aggressively, or after a night’s 
worth of Physics II problem 
sets. The highway barriers 
are there, but they are better 
seen than experienced.

Moonwalking brings on 
midlife crises
In his book Moondust: In Search of the 
Men Who Fell to Earth, British journalist 
Andrew Smith tracks down the nine 
surviving moonwalkers and comes to 
the startling realization that these indi­
viduals are going through a midlife cri­
sis that billions of us will never under­
stand: What do you do after you’ve 
walked on the moon? After experienc­
ing significant melodrama (Richard 
Gordon’s partner was so exhausted he 
almost cut him loose to die during a 
Gemini spacewalk), the moonwalkers 
discuss the difficulty of adjusting to 
pedestrian life while constantly being 
looked upon to deliver profound philo­
sophical insights at the drop of a hat. 
“You feel inadequate that you can’t 
give people the answers they want,” 
says Gene Cernan, the commander of 
Apollo 17. Maybe so. But you can always 
say you’ve walked on the moon.

Hairworms steal minds 
of grasshoppers
Somewhere, a crazed grasshopper 
is leaping through a field of grass. It 
wants a pool. Grasshoppers can’t swim. 
It needs a pool. Grasshoppers can’t 
swim. Eventually, it finds a pool, leaps 
in, and drowns.
This phenomenon baffled biolo­
gists from the French National Center 
for Scientific Research in Montpelier, 
France — but not as much as what hap­
pened next. Within minutes, the grass­
hopper’s body began to fall apart, and a 
hairworm emerged from its mouth.
The hairworm is a parasite that 
spends its early life gnawing on grass­
hopper and cricket innards. When fully 
grown, the hairworm must return to 
the water — a problem it has cleverly 
rectified by brainwashing its host to do 
it instead. By the time it reaches the 
water, the possessed grasshopper has 
been reduced to nothing more than a 
brainless shell. Investigators found that 
more than 100 grasshoppers infected 
by the hairworm obligingly found water 
and took the suicidal plunge. There are 
approximately 300 species of hairworm 
that infect everything from frogs to fish 
and snails. But don’t worry about Fido 
— while all the animals suffer, only 
grasshoppers and crickets lose their 
minds.

Bubonic mice disappear 
from New Jersey lab
Three mice disappeared from the 
Public Health Research Institute at the 
University of Medicine and Dentistry 
of New Jersey (UMDNJ). The mice are 
all infected with the bacterium respon­
sible for bubonic plague. Officials can­
not explain how the mice disappeared, 
proposing instead that they might 
have been misplaced in a paperwork 
error or stolen. Following the theft 
allegation, the institute began conduct­
ing lie detector tests and interrogating 
dozens of employees. Investigations are 
also being conducted by the FBI and 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, The Star Ledger of Newark 
reported on Thursday. The plague 
is not contagious, but it can devel­
op into pneumonic plague, which is 
contagious if left untreated. Though the 
researchers claim that the mice are 
probably dead from the disease already, 
do yourself a favor and watch where 
you step.

Imagine a house powered by the sun: 
heating, cooling, cooking, everything. A 
team of CMU architects, designers, and 
various other majors are making this 
happen by building a sustainable house 
to run on solar energy. In this optimal 
home, the electricity generated by the 
sun is a renewable power source for 
every energy need.
CMU’s Pittsburgh Synergy group will 
be competing in the Solar Decathalon, an
international competition sponsored by 
the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. 
The competition will bring together 
18 colleges and universities from around 
the globe to compete in a sustainable 
design project. On September 28, teams 
will transport their entries to Washington, 
D.C., where they will construct a “solar 
village” on the National Mall. Teams will 
be judged on the build, design, and effi­
ciency of their solar-powered homes.
Pittsburgh Synergy’s building has 
two sections. Entry is through its Great 
Room, the main living area where
people can eat, work, and watch tele­
vision. Alternatively, the Service Core 
portion of the building is located in the 
back. This section houses the kitchen, 
bathroom, bedroom, and mechanical 
space. The mechanical room is where 
monitoring equipment for the photo­
voltaic (PV) panels are located. They 
monitor how much energy PVs gather 
during the day verses how much energy 
is being spent. An exterior system above 
the house, called “the Eye,” localizes all 
mechanical systems: absorption chiller,

Griffiths to conduct research at 
Carnegie Mellon (more than 
4000 miles away).
Griffiths, instrumental for 
CMU’s involvement in the SALT 
Project, stated in the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette on September 5 
that he is interested in using 
the SALT to analyze previously 
observed galaxies to determine 
what fraction of the recorded X- 
ray emissions are coming from
WHAT IS A 
QUASAR?
A quasar is an astronom­
ical object that looks like a 
star in optical telescopes. 
Quasars appear to be red, 
are very distant and emit 
more energy than dozens 
of normal
quasars and which from active 
galaxies. By subtracting quasar 
X-rays from those sources, he 
hopes to use the distribution 
of galactic clusters to measure 
“dark energy,” the inexplicable 
force thought to be accelerating 
the expansion of the universe.
“It’s great that the telescope 
can be used remotely,” said 
Philip Cuadra, a senior electri­
cal and computer engineering 
major, “It’s nice to see CMU tak­
ing an active interest in astro­
physics research.”
This summer, the first 
light from space reached the 
SALT from the Lagoon 
Nebula part of the Sagittarius 
constellation, from 3800 
light years away. Following 
its completion, South African 
President Thabo Mkeki will 
officially open the SALT on 
Nov. 10, enabling astronomers

existed before Earth was even 
formed.

Professor Steven Lee has 
played a critical role as the 
team’s advisor. Lee has taught 
five courses on the project and 
supervised the building’s con­
struction over the summer. Says 
Lee on his role in the construc­
tion and teaching: “I can influ­
ence the future of architecture 
by being a positive role model 
and getting students involved in 
what I think is critical in sav­

otherwise — is up to him or her.
Building this house was a 
great opportunity to utilize local 
resources. Essential materials, 
including the window systems 
and high insulation panels, were 
donated by local companies. 
Local union carpenters, electri­
cians, steam fitters, operating 
engineers, and concrete fin­
ishers also offered their hands 
during the various stages of the 
process. The project was termed

Even with windfalls like local 
support, obstacles faced the team 
at all turns. The project has cost 
approximately $400,000 in total. 
However, the team is only pro­
vided with $5000 to begin, along 
with, a truck to transport the 
house to Washington.
The building must be easy to 
reconstruct, as well, because it 
must be taken apart for transport. 
The final competition allows five 
days for assembly on the National 
Mall. As a result, the team had to 
utilize the “plug and play” con­
cept: Pieces of the house can be 
literally plugged together so that 
all parts have electricity and heat­
ing.
This project has been a great 
learning experience for those 
involved, according to students. 
“This has been a great oppor­
tunity to implement ideas we’ve 
learned in school,” says Forsythe. 
“The most exciting moment is see­
ing something you’ve envisioned 
unfold into a reality.”
Finding alternative energy 
sources has become a serious 
pursuit in recent years in light 
of the energy crisis due to fossil 
fuel depletion. “The reason why 
I love this project is because as a 
country we are so wasteful of 
energy, and utilizing solar energy 
will eliminate the dependence on 
fossil fuels from overseas,” says 
Ann Roy, a team member. “We 
are creating a language that really 
applies to sustainable design.”
Test Your Knowledge: 
Light and Optics
Every substance produces a 
different color (wavelength) 
of light when burned.
b y St
True — When a substance is 
burned it gives off a character­
istic wavelength of light that can 
be used to determine its compo­
sition through a process called 
grating spectroscopy.
When we look at another 
distant star system we are 
seeing a delayed image of it.
? T DF
True — Light does not possess 
infinite velocity. The image we 
see of a distant planet or galaxy 
has been carried to us over the 
course of hundreds of thousands 
of years. Thus, we are actually 
looking into the past.
“Mirages” on roads are 
caused by the scattering of 
light.
b y St
False — The “haze”you might 
see on the highway while driving 
on a hot day is actually the result 
of a difference in the density of 
the air caused by heat. This dif­
ference refracts the light and 
produces a subtle haze.
Objects are closer than they 
appear in passenger-side mir­
rors because of the driver’s 
viewing angle.
b y St
False — The passenger-side 
mirror is slightly convex to bet­
ter cover a car’s blind spot. The 
curvature makes objects appear 
smaller and therefore farther 
away.
Fiber-optic cables carry 
information using light and 
sound.
b y St
False — Fiber optics, as their 
name would imply, rely only on 
light. The cables are actually 
fine tubes that use the principles 
of total internal reflection to
bounce waves of light along the 
inside surface — the result is a 
cable that can transport infor­
mation at the speed of light.
Light can be bent, reflected, 
and refracted.
? t If
False — Light is never actually 
bent; it can only be reflected and 
refracted. In refraction, the path 
of the light changes as it passes 
from one medium to another; 
this is commonly referred to as 
“bending. ”
Reading glasses sometimes 
appear to have a “rainbow” 
on them.
? T QF
True — If you orient the sur­
face of a prescription lens just 
right, you can see a “rainbow” 
of color. The resulting rainbow is 
actually the dispersal of light as it 
passes through the coating on the 
surface of the lens.
Polarized sunglasses block

False — Polarized lenses use 
special dichronic coatings which 
block out waves with a particu­
lar kind of polarization and let 
through all the rest. The result is 
that much of the unwanted glare 
from a light source is removed, 
but the effect is independent of 
wavelength.
If there were no atmosphere, 
there would be no daytime.
b y St
True—Without an atmosphere 
we would only see light from the 
sun if we stared directly at it. We 
have daylight because the Earth’s 
atmosphere scatters the light 
across its surface. Scattering 
lets us see different wavelengths 
depending on the sun’s position 
relative to our location.

Quasi-cadaverous canines
Pittsburgh scientists make great strides in réanimation
Breakthroughs in medical technol­
ogy could give critically wounded sol­
diers crucial extra time to be moved into 
surgery. A chance for medics to move 
them off the battlefields and to a place 
where they can receive proper treatment 
instead of facing the nearly impossible 
task of performing transfusions and CPR 
in the line of fire. These soldiers, and 
other victims of circumstances in which 
medical help is hours away, can have 
their lives saved — by ending them 
first.
Oijly a few blocks from the Carnegie 
Mellon campus, some of the biggest 
breakthroughs in cryogenic resuscita­
tion — in which subjects are frozen and 
clinically dead for a time before being 
revived — are taking place. You may 
have read about it this summer, when 
British tabloids took hold of the story 
and posted headlines reading “Zombie 
Dogs” across the Internet. However, this 
research means more to the world than 
just bringing the family pet back from 
the dead.
At the University of Pittsburgh’s Safar 
Center for Resuscitation Research in 
Oakland, scientists have been attempt­
ing to perfect the science in hopes of ap­
plying it to humans within a few years.
The process, which has been carried 
out in a trial study with 24 dogs, is a 
complicated one that leaves the animal 
clinically dead for up to three hours be­
fore bringing it back to life. First, the cir­
culatory system is flushed and replaced 
with nearly freezing saline solution. This 
induces a state of extreme hypothermia 
that leaves the dog in suspended anima­
tion— not breathing, with no heartbeat
— but the freezing saline preserves its 
vital organs. The animal can be revived 
later by reintroducing blood to the body, 
applying electrical shocks to the heart, 
and giving the subject pure oxygen.
This summer, scientists at the Safar 
Center extended the period of sus­
pended animation from two hours to 
three by adding glucose and dissolved 
oxygen to the saline solution. It was this 
breakthrough that was unfortunately 
met with the extremist “Zombie Dogs!” 
headlines from the press: publicity that 
took the issue in precisely the wrong 
direction. While knee-jerk reactions 
may have been expected — no doubt 
a horror movie reference was far too 
easy for whichever writer dreamed it up
— these developments could mean so 
much more.
Rather than create an army of “liv­
ing dead” animals, these procedures 
could one.day be used to save almost
50,000 lives per year. In many cases, 
victims of shootings on battlefields and 
street corners alike bleed to death before 
proper blood transfusions or CPR tech­
niques can be administered. By putting 
these victims into a state of suspended 
animation, medical authorities would 
be given crucial extra time to perform 
life-saving procedures. By temporarily 
ending the patient’s life they would have 
better chance of saving it.
This is not to say that the procedure 
does not have its flaws, both techni­
cal and ethical. Despite the program’s 
positive results, there have also been 
cases of physical and behavioral 
problems upon ending the suspended 
animation. More importantly, the real 
questions seem to focus on what could 
happen when a human being is brought 
into this state of living death. What will 
happen to a person brought back to life? 
Will he or she be the same person physi­
cally, mentally, and socially after having 
“died”?
The risks are evident; but, the reward 
is great. Only time will tell how ap­
plicable these breakthroughs will be to 
humans.
Pa. state legislators bend constitution for pay raise
If there’s one thing more bothersome 
than living in a state whose lawmakers 
give themselves a hefty pay raise, it’s 
knowing that the underhanded politi­
cians did it like real criminals — in the 
middle of the night.
At approximately 2 am on July 7, 
Pennsylvania lawmakers raised their 
own pay by anywhere from 16 to 34 per­
cent of their previous salary. The legisla­
tors gave themselves the financial pat 
on the back right before the Legislature 
disbanded for the summer, deliberately 
circumventing the state Constitution by 
collecting payment early. There was no 
debate, no public censure. Then they 
left for vacation, running away like bank 
robbers who just bought themselves 
tickets to Hawaii.
It gets better. Over half of the 
lawmakers are taking the payment as 
'‘expense reimbursement” rather than as 
actual salary, allowing them to receive 
the money immediately, and without 
taxes.
Although the pay hike has been the
subject of much condemnation from 
some lawmakers, particularly due to its 
categorization as “reimbursement,” two 
court cases have ruled it legal. However, 
as a top GOP lawmaker explains: “We 
write the law so if the judges mess with 
us, they lose their pay raise. So they 
always find what we do on a pay raise to 
be constitutional.”
And though Governor Ed Rendell has 
criticized the lawmakers who took the 
money as compensation, he also called 
the July pay raise for his state officials 
“good legislation” in a July 17 letter to a 
York, Pa., newspaper.
How can selfish law-skirting be con­
sidered “good legislation” while so many 
Pennsylvania residents are struggling 
to pay property taxes and health care 
costs?
And since we’re on the subject of 
property taxes, what about the fact that 
meaningful property tax reform has 
failed for the last three decades in Penn­
sylvania? Just wait until next year’s pri­
mary — such reform will be most likely
be at the forefront as lawmakers attempt 
to distract Pennsylvania citizens from 
their dubious lawmaking.
According to the Pittsburgh Post- 
Gazette, more than 40 legislators are 
attempting to repeal the July pay raises. 
The Post-Gazette notes that since the bill 
passed in the House 119-79 and in the 
Senate 27-23, at least 23 House mem­
bers and three Senators would have to 
switch sides if the repeal is to succeed. 
However, it also states that “convinc­
ing leaders of both parties to allow it to 
have a floor vote [in the House] will be 
difficult.... Historically, legislation that 
leaders oppose is simply referred to a 
committee and dies without a vote.”
State Representative Daryl Metcalfe 
(R-Cranberry) # offers sobering insight
— some legislators claim they deserve 
higher pay because they put in long 
hours. Maybe Carnegie Mellon students 
should try this approach during finals.
In the meantime, legistators need 
to swallow their pride and close their 
wallets.
Cindy Sheehan deserves America’s praise
I found the denunciation of Cindy 
Sheehan in the Sept. 12 Tartan by Ben­
jamin Hackett extremely disgusting. On 
Sept. 11, I listened to Cindy Sheehan 
and other parents who had lost chil­
dren in Iraq. They were determined to 
do what they could to keep other par­
ents from having to endure the same 
grief they had suffered.
Most Americans now realize that the 
war in Iraq has nothing (0.00000) to 
do with American security. It was de­
fended by deliberate lies told by George 
W. Bush, Dick Cheney and others. The 
attack on Iraq was a criminal violation 
of international law ordered by Presi­
dent Bush. As a direct result of that 
criminal act more than 1800 Ameri­
can men and women have died and 
thousands more have been seriously 
wounded.
The statement that Bush is trying 
to “spread democracy and freedom 
throughout the world” is (to quote the 
words used by Ben Hackett) “one of 
sheer idiocy and displays a pervasive 
lack of education on American for­
eign policy.” The Bush administration 
helped to organize an effort that at­
tempted to overthrow the democrati­
cally elected government of Venezuela. 
Agents of President Bush denounced
and violated the Geneva convention 
against torture. Amnesty International 
has condemned U.S. human rights vio- • 
lations in Guantanamo and in Iraq. »0 » 
Here at home Bush has worked to 
limit individual freedom by the “Patriot 1 
Act” and has declared the right to im-;, 
prison anyone he labels as an enemy;'; 
for an indefinite period without any. 
charges or any right to a trial. In Texas 
under Gov. Bush and his successors 
many people have been executed with­
out having a fair trial. Clearly the strug­
gle for democracy and freedom begins 
here. -ito
Cindy Sheehan is not exploiting^ 
her son’s death for personal gain, as 
claimed by Ben Hackett. Rather, she 
deserves the praise of all decent Ameri-;u 
cans for her efforts to prevent parents 
and spouses and children from hav-1 
ing to suffer the loss of a loved one in! 
Bush’s war. The best way to support our - 
troops and to help protect our security. 5 
is to insist that members of the NationaL; 
Guard be returned from Iraq imme7,, 
diately and that all U.S. troops return , 
within a year. UII

Paralympians deserve recognition 
just as much as “real” Olympians
Christian D’Andrea
Men missing limbs go out and run 
faster races than many college track 
stars. Men and women in wheelchairs 
crash into each other recklessly in 
the name of competition. These are 
athletes in the prime of their careers, 
pushing their bodies to the limits to be 
crowned champion. And despite the 
intense competition and displays of 
athleticism, you won’t find these sports 
anywhere on television in America.
This week marks the one-year 
anniversary of the 2004 Paralympic 
Games, an 11-day event held after the 
Olympic Games that pits the world’s 
best disabled and handicapped athletes 
against each other. While the games are 
modified to tailor to their disabilities, 
the events still mirror Olympic com­
petition, including basketball, cycling, 
soccer, and swimming. Advancements 
in medical technology and personal 
training have made the Games more in­
triguing than ever, allowing Paralympi­
ans to have performances comparable 
to top levels of physically abled com­
petition. Last year, the United States 
placed fourth in the overall medal 
count, 53 medals behind first-place 
finisher China.
However, many Americans wouldn’t 
even know about the events if not 
for the recent sport documentary 
Murderball, which follows the U.S. 
wheelchair rugby team in their journey 
to the Games. Though it seems that 
the film will eventually become a cult 
favorite at best, it has still left a more 
lasting impression of the competition 
involved in the games and the games 
themself than anything seen in Amer­
ica to date.
I believe the reason for this is simple: 
The Paralympic Games aren't marketed 
to the masses in America. Why watch 
a blind cyclist work for a gold medal 
when we have 24-hour-a-day cover­
age of Lance Armstrong in France? 
Why watch amputees race when track 
is, at best, a novelty sport in America
anyway? Why broadcast another, less 
attractive Olympics that might confuse ^ 
viewers when the real thing happened 
just weeks earlier?
The biggest case for broadcasting1 
these games can’t be explained fully ih1 
words, but rather was best presented 
in Murderball. The film captures the 
dedication and camaraderie presented' 
by the Games, and more importantly* 
showcases the sense of competition 
that is inherent in all sport. Viewers be-, 
gin to see the sacrifices that these men 
make for their team, the friendships 
and bonds they forge as teammates,- 
and the rivalries and respect (or lack 
thereof) interwoven in competition.
Like all athletes, the game becomes 
a huge part of who they are, chang­
ing them and making them stronger 
in light of their own misfortune. The 
movie begins as a film about a team 
of paraplegics playing a sport you’ve..n 
never heard of. It ends as a movie. 
about a team and a common bond, ^ 
film as powerful as Hoop Dreams was to 
athletes years before.
The Paralympic Games have proven 
that compelling factors to merit ’ 
national coverage lie within their com-, 
petitions. The Paralympics offer end­
less storylines, most of them more inn r- 
teresting than those in the “real” 01ym-,„ 
pic Games. With a steadily increasing 
level of competition across Paralympic, 
sports, it is no longer viable to say that 
these events aren’t exciting enough 
to present on television. With ESPN 
constantly expanding and Fox Sports 
Net trying to keep up, it is no Ion-,*- 
ger acceptable to keep the Paralympic 
Games in the shadows. Tell the folks iiju, 
the broadcast booths to put competitive^, 
billiards and poker on the side burner 
for a while — there are Olympians 
who are waiting for their spotlight in 
America.

“portraying witchcraft” — oh 
yeah, because every kid I know 
really believes that he can get 
into Hogwarts — to “sexuality,” 
“violence,” and my personal 
favorite, “political views.” Appar­
ently the First Amendment has a 
loophole for literature.
It seems the point most people 
are missing is that reading some­
thing doesn’t mean you have to
believe it. Flipping through Amer­
ican Psycho won’t make you one; 
publicly setting fire to it in front 
of a library might. We live in a 
country that is kind enough to 
support most freedoms of ex­
pression, and we have almost 
unlimited access to hundreds 
upon thousands of ideas. Don’t 
like a book’s message? Just put 
it down.

This week, I will update you 
on three of the main projects that 
Nicolette and I are currently work­
ing on: the Collegiate Readership 
Program, dining, and the soon- 
to-be-formed Communications 
Task Force.
Last year, the undergraduates 
voted to pay a five-dollar me­
dia fee so that Carnegie Mellon 
could participate in USA Today’s 
Collegiate Readership Program, 
which provides undergraduates 
with USA Today, The New York 
Times, and the Pittsburgh Post- 
Gazette at ten distribution points 
on campus. Over the summer,
I worked with representatives 
from USA Today and Student 
Activities to plan the readership 
program’s launch, mainly by 
locating the most-visited areas 
on campus to place the display 
cabinets. To make sure students 
are taking full advantage of the 
newspapers, I have been moni­
toring each distribution site and 
will move display locations as 
necessary. If you have thoughts 
on the Collegiate Readership 
Program or if there are other 
places on campus you would like 
to see the newspapers, please. % 
feel free to send me an e-mail.
According to the student body, 
dining is also an area that could 
use improvement, and I will 
work hard to enact the positive, 
changes the students want and. 
deserve. As Tim Michael will be 
named the director of Housing 
and Dining Services, I predict a . 
number of exciting changes tp.<, 
our dining system, some starting t 
during this academic year. I will 
be meeting with him to discuss 
the formation of the Dining . 
Advisory Committee (DAC) and,;, 
depending on the progress Tim 
has made with his plans for 
the committee, I will consider ,' 
proposing the official disband:, 
ing of the Student Body Dining, 
Committee. However, before any^ 
significant changes are made, 
there are a few points I will have 
to discuss with Tim.
Nicolette and I are also in 
the process of forming the 
Communications Task Forqes, 
(CTF). We are discussing who-,.. 
on campus would be best suited, 
to work on this particular project1 
with us. Whoever we approach to 
aid us in the development of the 
CTF will be asked to consider the 
effectiveness of different types.c ¦ ' ' Jof communication on campus,., 
mostly for the advertising of cam-7* 
pus events. Depending on the sue- J 
cess of the fledgling CTF, the task' 
force could be expanded to look 
at the communication processes 
between the administration and * 
students. More detailed informa-, 
tion on the CTF will be forthcom- ' 
ing in a few weeks.

Capitalism is the key to New 
Orleans’ timely reconstruction
Build a moat for 
your cyber-castle
Ben Hackett
As a Mardi Gras veteran and 
Jazz Fest lover, as well as a 
friend to many of those who 
call the region home, I feel for 
the city of New Orleans. The 
responsibility falls onto the citi­
zens of these United States to 
rebuild this city with its rich 
heritage. However, merely 
throwing money at the problem 
will not suffice this time around. 
Th‘e floodwaters in New Orleans 
seem to have washed the city's 
dirty little secrets out into the 
open. No longer can the failed 
infrastructure of a welfare state 
operate unsuccessfully without 
attentions being paid.
¦The AP reports that “fewer 
than half of the Hurricane 
Katrina evacuees living in shel­
ters in the Houston area want 
to' go home again, according to 
a poll by The Washington Post 
arid the Henry J. Kaiser Family 
Foundation.” This is a reflection 
of the lack of opportunity and
equity within the city limits.
If one had taken early media 
reports for gospel, the doom and 
gloom picture painted of New 
Orleans would have been over­
whelming. The facts are that 
the New Orleans revival is way 
ahead of even the most optimis­
tic estimates. Business owners 
are being allowed back into the 
city to begin preparations for 
reopening. Mayor Nagin is urg­
ing 180,000 residents to return 
to certain areas of the city. Gone 
are the estimates of 10,000 dead, 
now replaced with the reality of 
the latest body count of 579. 
The Army Corps of Engineers 
said water is getting pumped out 
of eastern New Orleans more 
quickly than ever expected and 
that the area should be dry by 
the end of the month. Does this 
sound like the New Orleans that 
was going to be closed for a 
year?
Ignore the statements being 
made by pundits and obtuse 
ultra-leftist bloggers. As she 
lines her pocketbook with cash 
from her new deal with Speaking 
Matters LLC, Cindy Sheehan 
belches, “George Bush needs to
stop talking..., pull our troops 
out of occupied New Orleans 
and Iraq, and excuse his self 
from power.”
Intelligent people scoff at 
these suggestions, as such 
actions would harm the rebuild­
ing efforts. Pundits like Sheehan 
and Curtis Muhammad, the 
organizing director of CLU 
(Community Labor United), fuel 
absurdities with allegations that 
“the moral values of our govern­
ment [are] to ‘shoot to kill’ hun­
gry, thirsty black hurricane sur­
vivors for trying to live through 
the aftermath.” Curtis thinks, 
“This has turned a natural disas­
ter into a man-made disaster, 
fueled by racism.” Allegations 
of a George Bush hurricane 
machine — one he fires up to 
target black people in major cit­
ies — cannot be far behind.
According to the fringe left, 
the reason New Orleans rescue 
efforts are so “awful” is because 
the city has a large minority 
population. The rush to politi­
cize and the invocation of rac­
ism are standard DNC playbook

Imagine this: You’re living 
in a city where, all of a sud­
den, the crime rate skyrockets. 
City officials tell you it will be 
at least several years before it 
could even have a chance of go­
ing down. What do you do? Do 
you take steps to protect your­
self? Upgrade the locks on your 
doors? Put bars on your win­
dows? Form a neighborhood 
watch group? Hire a private 
security force? Move out?
If this sounds familiar, let me 
remind you all of the computer 
megalopolis called Microsoft 
Windows.
On Thursday, the computer 
security firm eEye published an 
advisory warning users about a 
new vulnerability in the latest 
version of Internet Explorer on 
Microsoft Windows. This adds 
to the list of nearly 30 as-yet- 
unpatched major holes in the 
browser, according to network 
security firm Secunia.
So what?
It’s very tempting to ignore all 
of these warnings and blissfully 
go on using your computer; in 
fact, many people do. Carnegie 
Mellon’s Information Security 
Office reports that during July 
and August, 132 new computers 
were infected with various vi­
ruses and worms. This, in ad­
dition to 97 computers compro­
mised with spyware and 74 with 
various other gaping security 
problems, means that there are 
a good, number of people out 
there who either don’t keep se­
cure computing habits or don’t 
know how.
Thing is, it’s easy.
New locks on your doors? 
Try using a web browser other 
than Internet Explorer, such as 
Firefox, which can block many 
types of pop-up ads and spy- 
ware. As a benefit, it’s faster 
and more compatible, too.
Bars on your windows? Try 
turning off all of the extraneous 
services in Windows and install­
ing a piece of personal firewall 
software. The latest Windows

A PERSON’S OPINION

Alexandra Kilduff
This past Thursday, Lolita 
turned fifty. No, not the 
prepubescent sex object who 
will forever remain 14, but the 
book by Vladimir Nabokov that 
introduced her to the public.
When the book was released in 
1955 its content caused a public 
uproar. Half a century later, not 
much seems to have changed.’ 
Lolita has aged gracefully, ma­
turing from a sensational cul­
tural bomb into a controversial 
classic. However, even on her 
fiftieth birthday, hundreds of 
books that follow in her path are 
still met with challenges across 
the country.
Everyone knows who Lolita is; 
despite the initial opposition the 
book met, the name has entered 
our cultural vocabulary. “Lolita” 
is* the standard term for any 
underage seductress, and she is 
frequently accompanied by an 
older (much older) male coun­
terpart. But in Nabokov’s book 
she has a full name: Dolores 
Haze, twelve years of age, liv­
ing with her mother in a sleepy 
suburban town, and put on a 
pedestal by her mother’s angst- 
ridden and unbalanced lodger, 
the improbably named Humbert 
Humbert.
Humbert Humbert falls in 
love — and lust — with spunky 
Dolores, nicknamed Lolita, and 
in a desperate and daring move 
marries her mother to stay close 
to the girl. But a couple of years 
and a few convenient deaths 
later, he and Lolita are on the 
run and in an intense sexual re­
lationship. The rest of the book 
is a whirlwind of sex, drugs, and 
teen pregnancy, spiced up with a 
gopd murder or two.
^n a decade when husbands 
and wives were supposed to 
sleep in separate twin beds, it 
makes sense that a book like this

would meet with considerable 
resistance. However, it’s not the 
material that truly makes the 
book dangerous. It’s the fact that, 
even though we cannot com­
pletely love Humbert Humbert 
(he is a pedophile, after all), we 
feel badly for him, and therefore 
we identify with him. And even 
though we cannot completely ap­
prove of Lolita, we admire her, 
as she seems to have the upper 
hand in the relationship. These 
characters are not completely out 
of our scope, and that frightens 
readers.
Have we, like Lolita, grown up 
since then? Not really. In 1962, 
a film version of Lolita, by the 
gifted director Stanley Kubrick, 
that was met with guarded in­
terest. Perhaps more telling 
of our attitude toward Lolita, 
however, is the story behind the 
1997 version. Starring Jeremy 
Irons as Humbert Humbert and 
Dominique Swain as Lolita, the 
movie was made when Swain 
was the correct age for the part, 
but it wasn’t released until she 
was about seventeen. Why? Be­
cause it sat on the shelves for 
two years, unable to find a dis­
tributor willing to take on its 
“controversial” content. So much 
for maturity.
Lolita doesn’t exist in a vac­
uum. In the United States there 
are still hundreds upon hun­
dreds of books that are banned 
from public libraries, chal­
lenged by interest groups, and, 
in the case of many Harry Pot­
ter novels, burned in bonfires 
a la Fahrenheit 451 (and Nazi 
Germany). The American Library 
Association has published a list 
of the top 100 most challenged 
books from 1990 to 2000. The 
titles range from the expected 
(Madonna’s Sex, The Anarchist 
Cookbook) to the eyebrow-rais- 
ing (To Kill a Mockingbird, Julie 
of the Wolves) to the downright 
ridiculous (James and the Giant 
Peach — pardon me?). Reasons 
for these challenges include

Direct efforts towards rebuilding 
New Orleans, not scapegoating
HURRICANE, from All
material.
Less than 24 hours after Katrina 
hit and the levees broke, fingers 
were pointed instead of sandbags 
being lifted. The bias was obvious; 
watching ABC’s coverage implode 
was spectacular. The reporter, 
Reynolds, picked out three black 
female evacuees (one of the low­
est Bush voting demographics) 
and probed them with leading 
questions. One instance had 
Reynolds asking, “Was there 
anything that you found hard to 
believe? [Anything] that he said 
that you thought, ‘Well, that’s nice 
rhetoric, but, you know, the proof 
is in the pudding?”’ Questions 
like these are the mainstay of the 
media in post-Katrina coverage. 
Unfortunately for the networks, 
citizens expressed their anger 
with local management and
expressed hope in the federal 
rebuilding process. When asked, 
“Did you harbor any anger toward 
the president because of the 
slow federal response?” Connie 
London replied, “None whatso­
ever, because I feel like our city 
and our state government should 
have been there.... They should 
have been on their jobs.” Connie 
is correct. New Orleans has let its 
poorer people down for 60 years, 
but in Katrina’s wake, new hope 
emerges.
When the American taxpayers 
rebuild this city, it must be done 
without waste. The cleaning 
must begin within the city’s own 
infrastructure. Local officials such 
as those in Louisiana’s emergency 
planning agency — officials 
currently awaiting trial over up to 
$60 million in “unaccounted-for” 
federal emergency management 
funds — must be terminated.
Bloated bureaucracy and failed 
entitlement programs will now 
be replaced with the hope and 
opportunity that accompanies 
economic development.
Government handouts should 
be replaced by new enterprise 
zones. Opportunity and pay­
checks must replace misery and 
welfare checks. The waters that 
washed through New Orleans 
pushed decades of failed liberal 
entitlement policies into the lime­
light. The opportunity has now 
come to build a stronger, more 
equitable New Orleans: a New 
Orleans based on capitalism, not 
entitlement.

The most complete (and 
expensive) option, though, is to 
simply up and move out. Switch­
ing from Windows to another 
computer operating system is the 
only way to finally rid yourself of 
the blight in your (computing) 
lifestyle.
Somewhat akin to moving to 
a quieter area with less crime, 
switching to a Mac or install­
ing Linux makes the practice of 
secure computing much more
accessible. It’s not that there are 
no vulnerabilities — there are 
dozens for both operating sys­
tems announced every year — it’s 
just that the small number and 
isolated nature of these vulnera­
bilities allows the system vendors 
to fix them. Correctly.
Imagine a world where you can 
laugh at the latest Windows secu­
rity advisory, knowing that you’re 
immune. Knowing that while va­
grants are in your neighborhood, 
there are so few of them that the 
authorities can catch them before 
they do any harm.
Hilarious it is, then, to hear 
Computing Services recom­
mend that Mac users run Norton 
Anti-Virus • on their machines, 
a program that adds no benefit 
to the computing experience, 
serving instead only to slow your 
machine down and make it less 
stable.
I actually went so far as to ask 
two of their reps why this policy 
exists; after a few choice mo­
ments of disbelief that I would 
even have the audacity to ques­
tion such an accepted policy, they
eventually said that they wanted 
to be ready when “that first prob­
lem came around.”
Do these same people have nu­
clear fallout shelters in their base­
ments, for when that first game of 
global thermonuclear war comes 
around?
The point is, it’s utterly stu­
pid to blindly follow what some 
self-proclaimed expert tells you 
to do with regard to computer 
security. Use some common 
sense, people! If you’re going to 
partake in a dangerous lifestyle, 
such as running Windows on your 
computer, protect yourself. But 
don’t prevent yourself from us­
ing your computer to its fullest 
potential.

The women’s volleyball team 
lost their first non-tournament 
match last Wednesday, pushing 
their record to 3-5, and 1-5 in 
their last six matches. On Friday 
and Saturday, however, looking 
eye to eye with a tournament 
that could have put the team 
in an insurmountable hole, the 
Tartans stepped up their game 
to complete four consecutive 
sweeps.
Playing in their first non­
tournament match against 
Washington & Jefferson College, 
the volleyball team lost a four- 
game set: 25-30, 30-28, 26-30, 
and 21-30. Junior Amanda 
Bradford, an All-UAA Honorable 
Mention selection last year, fin­
ished the match with 16 kills 
and 21 digs. Junior Becky Metier 
added 14 kills, and junior Catie 
Fisher came away with 21 more 
digs.
Junior setter Brea Carlock, 
who in 2004 ranked third in
the nation in assists per game, 
amassed a total of 45 assists in 
the Washington & Jefferson 
match, while junior Kathryn Fox 
tallied 21 digs. The team as a 
whole finished with ten blocks 
against the Presidents.
Despite the players’ promising 
individual statistics, the loss put 
the team two games under .500 
in a very competitive league. The 
Tartans needed a major spark to 
reignite their season. They got 
what they were looking for in 
their September 16-17 tourna­
ment at Case Western Reserve.
On Friday, Carnegie opened 
their tournament with a sweep 
versus John Carroll. With their 
backs against the wall, the 
Tartans never let the game get 
close, winning 30-20, 30-16, 
30-21.
An hour and a half later, CMU 
took down Case Western in simi­
lar fashion, fulfilling a 30-13, 
30-19, 30-21 lopsided sweep. 
Against Notre Dame the Tartans 
were again dominant, exploding 
to their third sweep of the day; 
30-24, 30-22, and 30-19.
On Saturday, after beating 
three tough teams 3-0 in suc­
cession the day before, the stage 
was set for a W&J-CMU rematch 
in the final game of the tourna­
ment.
To open the match, Carnegie 
dropped its first game of the tour­
nament, in a heated 29-31 loss. 
The Tartans, though, rebounded 
and won their next three games, 
30-19, 30-28, and 30-12 to take 
the victory.
With its undefeated tourna­
ment, Carnegie currently stands 
at 7-5, and head coach Kim 
Kelly is very pleased with her 
team’s keep-fighting mentality. 
Kelly, in her first season as the 
Tartans’ head coach, had previ­
ously held a head coaching job 
at Gettysburg College. There 
she coached the Bullets to a 
250-82 record, eight Centennial 
titles, and eight NCAA cham­
pionship appearances in eight 
years.
The Tartans will play their 
second non-tournament match 
at home on Tuesday, at 7 pm, 
against Marietta College.
now 4-0 after strong playMen's soccer

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team continued their 
undefeated season this week as 
they inched past Washington 
& Jefferson on Wednesday and 
dominated Juniata on Saturday. 
Junior forward Jonathan 
Browne scored in both matches 
and pulled within one goal of 
tying the school record for career 
goals scored.
Wednesday night the Tartans 
traveled to Washington,
Pennsylvania to defeat the 
Washington & Jefferson 
Presidents by a score of 1-0. 
Though the Tartans out-shot 
their opponent by a 19-6 score, 
the Presidents proved a defensive 
challenge. Goalkeeper Tyler 
Hodgins held Carnegie Mellon 
scoreless until Browne tallied 
one in the 70th minute.
“The team had several good 
chances which we just couldn’t 
capitalize on. It was a close game 
but we worked hard and got the
win. That’s the most important 
thing,” said Browne.
Carnegie Mellon did, however, 
capitalize on their chances 
Saturday when they hosted 
the Juniata Eagles. Exceptional 
teamwork and ball-control by the 
Tartans throughout the match 
proved too much for Juniata’s 
defense as the Tartans cruised to 
a 4-0 win.
The Tartans’ first opportunity 
came in the 36th minute when 
a Juniata handball resulted in a 
penalty shot: Senior midfielder 
Dan Mastalski rifled the shot but 
was deflected out by the diving 
Eagles’ keeper, Tim Penrod. It 
only took another three minutes 
for the Tartans to score when 
junior Andrew Park scrapped 
past Juniata defenders to head 
a cross from midfielder Sean 
Filipovitz past Penrod.
“I rather would have put it in 
easily,” Park said, smiling, “but 
we scored and usually it takes 
some fight to win.”
The second half began with 
the Tartans applying more 
pressure to the Juniata defense.
A bicycle kick from Browne 
hardly sailed over the goalpost 
within the first few minutes of 
the half. Although the Tartans 
were able to thread passes 
through the Eagle defense, they 
did not score again until the 65th 
minute, when Browne twice beat 
Penrod. ,(A
Browne’s first goal was an 
unassisted laser beam into (the 
low far post. His second, thirty- 
fivfe seconds later, was volleyed 
off a cross from Andrew Park*-
The Tartans’ final goal came 
twelve minutes later when 
sophomore midfielder Matt 
Humphrey scored his first career 
goal by heading in a free kick 
from Mastalski.
“It felt good to get into the 
game and make a difference,” 
said Humprey. “Hopefully I’ll get 
many more for the team this 
year.”
“This was the first game this 
season that really felt really 
great,” said Andrew Park. “We 
finished our opportunities ahd 
didn’t give the opposition many 
chances.”

There are few sports like soccer 
in which a team can thoroughly 
dominate another and still not 
win. Alas, that was the case 
Tuesday night when the Carnegie 
Mellon Tartans fought to a 
0-0 tie with visiting Penn State- 
Behrend.
Despite controlling possession 
for nearly the entire 90 minutes 
of regulation plus two 10-minute 
overtimes, and out-shooting their 
opponents by a 29-7 margin, the 
Tartans never managed to find 
the net. Tartan forward Hallie 
Dumont led the team with eight 
shots, including three on goal. 
Penn State-Behrend goalie Dara 
Nielsen recorded 12 saves to 
preserve the shutout.
First-year CMU forward Abigail 
Coffin expressed frustration with 
the result, saying, “It’s tough to 
play so well and have so many 
chances , to score and then wind 
up playing 110 minutes with a tie. 
We definitely had the better play 
but that’s the way that it works 
sometimes.”
The Tartans opened the game 
with an offensive barrage. In the 
17th minute, CMU forward Lisa 
Pascoli slid an off-balance shot 
just wide of the left post. Then,
five minutes later, midfielder 
Jessica Howard pushed back-to- 
back headers over the crossbar.
The Tartans’ best chances came 
at the start of the second half. 
In the 56th minute, Dumont 
collected a loose ball near the 
top of the box and fired a right­
footed shot that beat Nielsen, but 
caromed off the crossbar. Minutes 
earlier, the Tartans squandered 
another great scoring chance 
when Howard’s point-blank 
shot was knocked away by the 
fingertips of a diving Nielsen.
The Lions were packed in 
their own defensive half most of 
the night, but did manage the 
rare counter-attack. The most 
dangerous of these came near 
the end of the first overtime 
when Michelle Newland took 
Nikki Frisbee’s corner kick and 
redirected it on goal. Only a 
lunging effort by CMU goalie 
Mary Ashe prevented the score.
The disappointing result does 
not come without its positives 
for the Tartans, who proved their 
ability to possess the ball and 
maintain a constant offensive 
attack against a quality opponent. 
CMU moved the ball seamlessly 
across the field, and generated 
countless scoring chances with 
crosses played in from the 
outside. Dumont, the recipient of 
many of these balls, emerged as
a reliable target up top, and even 
established herself moving to the 
midfield to help with possession.
Only the teams’ finishing 
comes into question, and that, 
according to forward Kesey 
Stever, is not a serious concern. 
Says Stever, “We’ve shown we can 
score already [the Tartans scored 
18 goals in their first three games, 
all wins]; it’s just a matter of 
taking care of chances. We had 
more this game than usual, so 
next time we need to make sure 
we put some of those [scoring 
opportunities] away.”
The Tartans capitalized on 
these opportunities at the College 
of Wooster in Ohio, earning a 
2-1 victory behind a strong 
offensive performance. The team 
outshot Wooster 16-7 and forced 
the opposing goalie to make seven 
saves on the night.
Senior Hallie Dumont started 
the scoring for the Tartans, tying 
the game at one barely two 
minutes after Wooster had scored 
the first goal against the Tartans 
for the season. First-year Abigail 
Coffin scored the eventual game 
winner with only 11 minutes to 
play in the game.
The Tartans begin their 
UAA conference schedule on 
October 2 with a home match 
against Chicago University.

contributed with seven tackles. 
“This was a tough loss, but we 
still have high expectations. 
It’s a wake-up call for us; we need

Football loses heartbreaker at home 9-6
by Kevin LaBuz
Staffwriter
It’s not often in the game of 
football that a player gets a second 
chance, and yet that’s exactly 
what1 junior kicker Nathaniel 
Greenstein had. Minutes after 
hitting the left upright on a 
failed 47-yard.field goal attempt, 
Greenstein hit a 39-yard field 
goal with less than two minutes 
left to play.
That field goal, his second 
of the day, tied the game 6-6. 
However, it would not be enough
as the Tartans fell 6-9 to Johns 
Hopkins University.
Saturday’s match was a hard- 
fought game played between two 
evenly matched and determined 
teams. Saturday’s game pitted 
the Carnegie Mellon Tartans 
(2-1) against the Johns Hopkins 
University Blue Jays (3-0).
Both teams entered the contest 
with lengthy winning streaks, the 
Tartans having won four straight 
dating back to last season, and 
the Blue Jays having won their 
last six, including the last four 
games of a 9-2 season. Yet for the 
majority of the game it seemed as
if the Blue Jays’ winning streak 
was going to end at Gesling 
Stadium.
Before the game, Tartans head 
coach Rich Lackner noted that 
the keys to victory would be 
winning the kicking game and 
the turnover margin, and in fact 
the game did rest upon those two 
factors.
Ultimately, the final decision 
was made by a field goal. Blue 
Jays junior kicker Ben Scott 
converted all three of his field 
goal attempts: one for 45 yards, 
as well as one for a career-long 
46 yards. His final kick was for
24 yards as time expired. That, 
it turned out, was all it took to 
give the Blue Jays a 9-6 victory.
While the game ended in a loss 
for the Tartans, the team played 
extremely well — especially 
defensively. Much like last week, 
the Tartans’ offense produced 
little in the first half. However, 
this is not to disparage the offense; 
rather, it speaks to the strength of 
the Blue Jays’ defense.
The Tartan defense played 
equally as strong, allowing only 
three first-half points on a 45- 
yard field goal. Twice in the first 
quarter the Tartan defense made
big plays on third-and-one and 
fourth-and-inches situations. 
Those two plays epitomize the 
caliber of the game’s defensive 
play.
Also similarly to last week, 
the Tartans’ offense played 
substantially better in the second 
half. The bulk of their 195 yards 
rushing and 81 yards passing 
came after halftime. Sophomore 
fullback Travis Sivek rushed for 
over 100 yards for the second 
time in three games, and 
sophomore halfbacks Colby 
Whitman and Robert Gimson, as 
well as junior quarterback Kevin
Mulkern, all had over 20 yards on 
the ground. Mulkern also passed 
for 81 yards, including a key 36- 
yard pass to junior wide receiver 
Jon Kline in the fourth quarter 
that helped to set up Greenstein’s 
tying field goal.
On the flip side, Mulkern 
threw a decisive interception 
late in the third quarter that 
abruptly ended the Tartan drive 
that had covered over 60 yards 
in 12 plays on Johns Hopkins’ 
20-yard line.

Tennis wins home opener vs. CUP
Sophomore Amy Staloch, an All-American performer last year, won in singles and doubles play last week against California University of Pennsylvania.
by Shayela Solomon
Junior Staffwriter
The women’s tennis team 
didn’t drop a match in singles play 
,getting off to a fantastic start on 
Thursday in its first home match 
of the season against California 
University of Pennsylvania. The 
Tartans came away with an 8-1 
victory, creating a great way for 
the Tartan women to open their 
season and an impressive first win 
on newly refinished courts.
Last weekend, the team started 
its season at the Carnegie Mellon 
Invitational. However, since its 
home courts were in an unplayable 
condition, the tournament 
was moved to neighboring 
Robert Morris University. 
The Tartans faced stiff NCAA 
Division I competition against 
local schools Pittsburgh, 
Duquesne, and Robert Morris, 
and held their own, helping to 
prepare them for their eventual 
home opener against CUP.
The game stan ed with doubles 
play, which proved a good round 
for CMU. Two of their three pairs 
were victorious. The riveting 
match between CMU’s junior 
Mai Otsuka and senior Alison 
Liu versus CUP’s Lauren Hovey 
and Daniella Zevallos particularly 
drew the attention of fans when 
the set continued long after other 
matches had completed.
Spectators amassed to watch 
intently as Otsuka and Liu 
fought hard through a close 
match, battling back and forth 
and exchanging the lead several 
times. The two teams fought to
even the score at eight apiece, 
forcing a tiebreaker. However, in 
the end, Otsuka and Liu pushed 
through and won the tiebreaking 
set 7-5 to earn the victory. Also 
victorious was the number one 
doubles team of sophomore Amy 
Staloch and first-year Sheena 
David.
After the doubles, the teams 
moved on to singles matches, 
where Carnegie Mellon pulled 
away in a dominating fashion.
“I felt that the entire team 
kept it together through out both 
doubles and especially singles; 
everyone did their part and it 
turned out to be an awesome first 
home match,” said David, who 
defeated CUP’s Jessica Brown 
6-2 in the first set and 6-1 in the 
second.
True to form, each Tartan 
player fought and won both sets 
in her match. Through doubles 
and singles, the Tartans showed 
both strength and character. After 
the match the players were happy 
with themselves and each other 
regarding their performance.
“Even though we didn’t win 
all the doubles, all the girls did 
incredibly well in the singles. 
Everyone won in the singles, 
which was awesome. Overall, 
this past Thursday’s match 
was a great way to start off the 
season,” remarked first-year Kelly 
Nakamura, who defeated CUP’s 
Lauren Hovey 6-1 in straight sets 
at fourth singles.
The team is back in action 
this week at the ITA Regional 
Tournament, September 23-25. 
The tournament will be held at 
Mary Washington College.

Jack’s Mannequin
A unique band with clever lyrics
In this age of rock/punk bands with predict­
able melodic lines and poorly-written lyrics, 
it’s rare to find a unique band with talent. 
Although their music is reminiscent of many 
other influences, they add their own unique 
style to their instrumentation. This is obvious 
when listening to “The Mixed Tape,” the first 
single released from their album Everything 
in Transit. The song starts out sounding like 
the beginning of any song by Simple Plan, 
but quickly blows you away with its mixture 
of rock music and piano solos.
Jack’s Mannequin doesn’t use the piano to 
turn their music from punk/rock to easy- 
listening. Their music manages to retain its 
identity without blowing out your eardrums 
or lulling you to sleep. Surprisingly, Jack’s 
Mannequin also manages to write lyrics with 
which anyone can identify. One of the best 
lines from “The Mixed Tape” has to be: “As 
I rearrange the songs again/This mix could 
burn a hole in anyone/But it was you I was 
thinking of.”
Unlike other bands that have released one 
promising single, then faded away into 
oblivion, Jack’s Mannequin has a CD devoid 
of songs that you’ll skip over. The third track, 
“Bruised,” sounds like Ben Folds, with a little 
bit of Yellowcard thrown in. The song’s lyrics 
are easy to identify with, such as “Sometimes 
perfection can be/it can be perfect hell.”
Although the songs “Bruised” and “The Mixed 
Tape” are easily the highlights of album, 
the rest doesn’t peter out. Throughout the 
CD, the drumming by Tommy Lee stops 
most hints of repetition, which is appropriate 
when you consider what the album is based 
upon. Transit is devoted to chronicling lead 
singer Andrew McMahon’s teenage years 
while living in Southern California — with 
a healthy dose of irony to fill the gaps. As 
he says in the song “I’m Ready”: “My life has 
become a boring pop song/And everyone’s 
singing along.”
Despite his assertion that his life has “become 
a boring pop song,” Andrew McMahon defi­
nitely has enough going on in his personal 
life to ensure that it’s more than a flash in 
the pan. McMahon, the lead singer of both
Jack’s Mannequin and the group Something 
Corporate, took some time off from the latter 
to work on Transit. After McMahon took a 
break to record, he was diagnosed with acute
—

lymphatic leukemia, according to an article 
published on vhl.com. Because of his treat­
ments, he was too tired to record a video. As 
a result, he decided that the video for the 
first single off the CD, which is “The Mixed 
Tape,” would be animated. McMahon was 
also undergoing a bone marrow transplant 
the week of August 23, the CD’s release date, 
so he was unable to publicize it.
In an interview with MTV News, McMahon 
said that “we have a beautiful record that 
I love, and it helps me to be able to see 
something on the other side of this.” He is 
expected to make a full recovery. Until he 
does, many fans of Something Corporate 
and Jack’s Mannequin eagerly look forward 
to his next project.

There was a “Big Pushball Contest” at the end of Orientation. The Tartan 
reported: “This annual battle between the sophomores and the freshmen 
is of vital importance to all concerned; if the frosh win, they may legally 
doff their dinks. The sophomores then must wear the lowly dink as their 
admission ticket to the Frosh-Soph Hop....” I don’t know what a dink is, or 
what a doff is, but when I first read this I thought it might mean the first- 
years were-getting naked. And I nearly fainted.

A comedy duo came to Skibo ballroom, receiving good responses from those 
in attendance. The duo “set the mood of the evening early on with a bit 
about the ugliness of various members of the audience,” The Tartan wrote. 
One comedian was quoted as saying, “Remember, one out of three people 
are ugly, so look to your left and your right, if they are all right, then it must 
be you.” The duo also did impressions of Charles Bronson, Bing Crosby, and 
Jimmy Stewart. The Tartan reported that each of these actors was in a “new 
version of Reefer Madness.” All I know is, Reefer Madness was the only movie 
I’ve ever seen that was simultaneously boring and hilarious.

uses of Napster.” Oh, Napster, I miss you so much. Why did you leave me?

The Constant Gardener: a movie that matters
Complicated characters and an interesting plot make this movie a hit
Don’t be turned off by its title. The Constant Gardener 
is none of the following: a documentary on Martha 
Stewart’s house arrest, an adaptation of those magazines 
you always find in your grandma’s house, or a CNN crime 
special on the seemingly perfect Little League coach who 
was busy burying ex-lovers under his kid’s swing set. I 
know, I was disappointed too. What I found, though, 
was a movie brimming with political intrigue and social 
commentary supplemented with engaging characters 
and a unique directing style.
Ralph Fiennes, best known for his turn as everyone’s 
favorite Nazi in Schindler’s List, stars as Justin Quayle, 
a British diplomat much more suave than his last name 
ought to allow. Justin meets Tessa (Rachel Weisz), a 
fiery activist any man would fall in love with — she’s 
appropriately smart, passionate, and beautiful. The two 
of them soon enjoy the traditional CMU approach to 
love: incredible sex, some “getting to know you” chats, 
and marriage.
The film follows Justin and Tessa to Kenya, where Tessa 
is working with a young doctor to achieve equal patient 
rights in the AIDS-ravaged area. When Tessa witnesses 
what she takes to be the murder of a village girl, she 
begins a crusade to expose the evil underside of drug 
testing in Africa. Tessa’s seemingly benevolent motives 
against major pharmaceutical firms become the object 
of speculation when she is found brutally murdered. Her 
young colleague is nowhere to be found, leading some to 
assume it was a crime of passion.
Heartbroken at the thought of his wife’s infidelity, Justin 
begins a mission to uncover the truth of her death.

Rachel Weisz stars as human rights activist Tessa Quayle in The 
Constant Gardener.
toTraversing three continents and stopping at nothing 
unveil the conspiracy, Justin discovers a cover-up far 
more dangerous than a man who wears double-breasted 
suits could ever have imagined.
The sophomore effort of City of God director Fernando 
Meirelles, The Constant Gardener is not told in the linear 
fashion explained above. Fans of his breakthrough film 
will know Meirelles’s style, with liberal camera angles 
and a strict control of color.
Meirelles brings his recognizable approach to the picture, 
giving us glimpses of Justin and Tessa’s supposedly 
faultless love even as rumors of her infidelity swirl. 
Fiennes and Weisz are a true presence on the screen, 
and Bill Nighy, who played the burned-out rock star 
in Love Actually, takes a turn for the creepy as Justin’s
$ movie
boss. Fiennes perfectly balances the turmoil of a mild- 
tempered man whose passivity weakens with each 
plot twist — and Weisz expertly plays a woman whose 
intelligence is matched only by her beauty.
We are treated to views of Africa’s mysterious scenery 
and given a tour of the more compelling mysteries 
found within its endless landscapes. Raising questions 
of pharmaceutical companies’ motives and the lengths 
they’ll go to in order to make a buck, Meirelles has 
provided an anomaly in the stream of superhero films 
of recent months. This flick tackles the political thriller 
genre with an added element of drive and purpose. In 
short, it does not play like those Harrison Ford movies 
that always seem to be on TNT.
So even those of you scanning the newspaper for the latest 
HGTV special should check out The Constant Gardener. 
Its unique blend of intrigue and romance satisfies all film 
tastes, not to mention that you’ll sound really smart next 
time you discuss the presence of major corporations in 
impoverished Africa (who knows when that’ll come up 
again?). Meirelles has brought us an enthralling story 
different from the rest: This one has a point. Arriving 
just in time for awards season, The Constant Gardener is a 
movie that matters. See it, and leave with a more lasting 
impression than the one in your seat.

A Taste of Honey
Thursday, September 22 
@ 8, 10,12
A Taste of Honey could be thought of as the original 
Will and Grace. Made in 1961, it tells the story of a 
girl who ends up on the street after her drunken 
mom gets married on a whim. The girl, Jo, lives 
with her gay friend Geoffrey and then gets preg­
nant after a one-night stand with a black sailor 
named Jimmy. Geoffrey decides to help her raise 
the baby, but things get complicated (as they often 
do with teenage mothers) when Jo’s ethanol- 
soaked mother resurfaces and wants a piece of the 
action. So maybe it’s not just like Will and Grace. I 
wouldn’t know, since I don't actually watch it, but 
it’s arguably similar, right?
Unleashed
Friday, September 23 
@8, 10, 12
It’s astonishing that a movie starring Jet Li and 
Morgan Freeman could bomb at the box office. 
However, Unleashed did just that. Perhaps people 
didn’t want to see Jet Li as a dog-collar-wearing 
slave — but then again, this movie contains the 
longest and most brutal fight scene Jet Li has ever 
taken part in. Also, Unleashed was directed by the 
guy who did The Transporter, so you know you’re 
in for a crazy action-fest. Interestingly enough, Un­
leashed has a reputation for being one of the most 
intelligent and/or least action-packed Jet Li mov­
ies yet.
The Longest Yard
Saturday, September 24 
@8, 10, 12
Remakes of beloved classic movies are becoming 
more and more common lately, probably because 
movie studios are running out of good ideas that 
they can successfully market to the masses. Re­
makes within a film genre that are already satu­
rated with cliches and predictable plots are an 
even safer bet, and that’s where The Longest Yard 
falls. Adam Sandler once again joins a football 
team of misfits to try and prove himself. This time 
around, the team members are all prison inmates 
playing against a team of guards. Most likely, 
someone learns a lesson about the value of hard 
work, or the importance of family, or maybe even 
true love. Oh right, and there’s football!
Bride & Prejudice
Sunday, September 25 
@8,10,12
What happens when you mix Bollywood with 
Jane Austen? Bride & Prejudice. Bollywood, the 
overarching title given to a style of movie that 
originated with the rapidly growing Indian film 
industry, involves lavish costumes, lavish sets, 
and ludicrous musical interludes. Jane Austen, for 
those not familiar, is a 19th-century author who 
wrote about the struggles of women in the English 
working class. When Bollywood collides with Ms. 
Austen, we get a deliciously brutal scrapheap of 
vivid colors,’ sweet accents, and hyperextended 
dance numbers that will probably imbue you with 
plenty of energy for the grueling days ahead.

A member of Rusted Root branching out on her own
When I first saw this red CD cover of a woman with an 
“I know something you don’t know” look on her face, I 
was a bit skeptical. Adding to my skepticism was the title 
of the album, AudioBioGraphical, which suggested to me 
that this artist somehow thinks that she can enlighten 
the listener on whatever it is that this cover girl seems 
to know. The “cover girl,” in this case, happens to be Liz 
Berlin — a member of Pittsburgh’s very own rhythmic 
rock group, Rusted Root.
Berlin has been working on this album for the past five 
years, putting in time when she’s not touring with Rusted 
Root. Not only did she write all 10 songs on the album, 
she assisted in the engineering and production as well 
in her very own Mr. Small’s Funhouse Recording Studio. 
This album follows her 2004 release Liz Berlin — Live, 
which was a culmination of live recordings of shows in 
Mr. Small’s Funhouse and Theatre dating back to 1999.
Liz Berlin’s band consists of Ford Thurston, Erik Cirelli, 
and Chris Lohr (The Yards) on electric guitars and Matt 
Vucic and Frank Marcello on drums. However, the key 
elements to the unique sound of the album are Megan 
Williams on violin and Weldon Anderson on upright 
bass.
Liz and her band paid attention to every detail of the 
album. She states on her blog: “A good song takes a huge 
effort to get out of your mind, whether it’s the beat, the 
chorus hook or that crazy-ass sound that you can’t figure 
out what it is. The placement of every sound, the delivery 
of every line, every word, every syllable is important. It’s 
these things that keeps a song spinning around in your 
head for hours... or years.”

Liz Berlin recorded her album in Pittsburgh’s own Mr. 
Small’s Funhouse.
The album starts off with a jazzy tune called “Love You,” 
which features Soma Mestizo’s Christianne Leach and 
Crisis Car’s Frank Spadafora. The guitar in this song 
resembles the soulful style of Santana, complete with 
distortion and edgy riffs. Although the album features 
Santana’s jazzy sound, it lacks the African and Middle 
Eastern influences of Rusted Root. It does, however, 
resemble some mellow Rusted Root tunes, such as 
“Heaven.”
Several other songs, including “Pretty Things,” “Crazy,” 
and “Ordinary Day,” have a ’90s art pop/rock style 
similar to those of artists like Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, 
Aimee Mann and Suzanne Vega. The infusion of violin 
and upright bass into songs like “Crazy” gives the album 
additional flare. There’s also a hint of folk (mainly evident 
in the lead guitar) in songs like “Monster” and “Picture.” 
Berlin’s influences include Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, 
PJ Harvey, and Bjork, which explains the limitless 
explorative nature of her album.
Berlin’s lyrics also possess a narrative and reflective theme. 
The stories in her songs have typical subjects such as love, 
sanity, and memories. Her lyrics include bitter lines like, 
“Do you want to take me home and put me on a shelf?/Do 
you want to take me home and languish me like no one 
else can?” and insightful thoughts like, “Maybe we should 
accept that crazy is our natural state.” She is also rather 
seductive at times: “Just show me how to say I love you/ 
I’ll show you how to say you love me too.” Throughout, 
Berlin’s lyrics become even more revealing and personal.
She closes the album on a harmonic note with “Evening 
Prayer” from the Humperdinck opera Hansel and Gretel, 
which tests her vocal range and demonstrates her talent 
as a classical singer. Her innovative nature produces a 
unique experimental voice. She can start off a song in a 
sexy jazzy style and belt out a few high notes to spice it up. 
The result is an album that varies between sweet, serene 
tones to a catchy, funky, and sometimes harsh beat. The 
transition between these genres is a series of peaceful 
clashes, similar to the songs of bands like Garbage.
Liz’s career as a solo act actually started about ten years 
ago. She has performed many shows in the last 10 years, 
including the H.O.R.D.E. Festival in 1996, the 1997 
Lilith Fair, and the Great Blue Heron Festival 2000 in 
Jamestown, NY. Her live performance is described as 
“truly hypnotic.” She is also touring with a fellow Rusted 
Root member, Jenn Wertz. For more information about

Our continuing series that brings you meals under $ 10, 
or in less than 20 minutes.
Here’s a quick fix from morning meal boredom. When 
you’re getting really, really tired of Cheerios every 
single morning and the bagels from the UC just aren’t 
like the ones at home, maybe it will even inspire you to 
eat breakfast.
Mama’s Cinnacrunch Apples 
Ingredients:
•1 apple (Mama says Rome, Jonathan, or Granny 
Smiths work well)
• 1 Tbsp. water
• 1 tsp. cinnamon
• 1 Tbsp. sugar (I used three packets)
•1/3 cup Raisin Bran Crunch (a small handful)
Kitchen Utensils:
•1 cutting knife
• 1 microwave safe bowl
• 1 fork
• 1 or 2 plastic sandwich bags
• 1 peeler, optional
Directions:
Slice apple thinly. If you have a peeler, peel the apple 
as well; this will allow more cinnamon to be absorbed 
into the apple. Place apple into a microwave-safe bowl. 
The bowl should be big enough to lightly toss the 
apples. Add the water.
Take the cinnamon and sugar and mix together 
thoroughly. A good way to do this is to place both 
ingredients in a plastic bag and tilt bag from side to 
side, pressing to get lumps out. Sprinkle the mixture 
over the apples and toss the apples so they are well 
coated.
Pop apples in the microwave for about a minute and a 
half. Take out, stir, and pop in for another minute. You 
should be able to easily insert a fork into the apples. 
If this doesn’t happen, pop in for another minute. 
While the apple is cooking or cooling, take Raisin Bran 
Crunch, place in a sandwich bag, and crush gently. 
Sprinkle Raisin Bran Crunch over the apple, eat and 
enjoy!

Bloomfield’s Little Italy
One blooming neighborhood worth visiting
restaurants and bakeries sporadically lining the blocks 
of Liberty Avenue. But Bloomfield was once the place to 
be if you were an Italian in Pittsburgh.
Founded in the early 1800s by a German immigrant 
named John Conrad Winebiddle, the neighborhood 
gained popularity among Italian immigrants after 
World War I. The increasing amount of industry in the 
greater Pittsburgh area — mainly steel, but also glass 
and railroads — was promising to those looking for a 
steady income. A mild cultural and less mild monetary 
divide was created within Bloomfield between the Ital­
ians and the German and Polish immigrants.
Those from outside Bloomfield took note of the influx 
of immigrants, and displayed a marked dislike for Ital­
ian immigrants and their social status. On January 21, 
1906, an article in the Pittsburgh Leader read, “Of late 
years hordes of Italians have made their home in the 
Sixteenth [Ward; that is, Bloomfield]. They are mostly 
of the poorer and less desirable class and live in a sec­
tion of the ward that is celebrated for its streets, knee- 
deep with mud.”
Despite the poor laborer status of the largely Italian 
town, there was a close-knit, extended-family feeling to 
the area. The Immaculate Conception Church of Saint 
Joseph Parish acted as a central hub for Bloomfielders 
of all backgrounds to gather and celebrate religion and 
holidays.
Today the church, which still stands, brings together 
a smaller grouping of older citizens of mostly Italian 
heritage. These parishioners live off the main road of 
Bloomfield, and many have seen drastic changes in the 
area even since the 1980s.
Kelly Harrington, the Irish owner for six years of Tessa- 
ro’s, an American bar and grill on Liberty Street in Little 
Italy, shared his perception of Bloomfield’s recent his­
tory. “It’s changed,” Harrington said. “The Italians have 
moved out, and their children came in. You can just see 
[it] changing. But it’s still a nice area.”
Bloomfield is similar to many other areas of Penn­
sylvania, which are being crippled as the young are
There are at least 88 distinctly different neighbor­
hoods in the Pittsburgh area. So it’s a safe bet to say 
that most Carnegie Mellon students have been to but 
a few of these neighborhoods — and most likely the 
newer you are to the Pittsburgh area, the fewer 
neighborhoods you’ve seen.
A “Little [insert country name 
here]” generally refers to an 
area, or neighborhood of a 
city, that has a strong con­
centration of people of one 
cultural background. There 
are a few Little Italys through­
out the country, the most famous 
one probably being the slowly di­
minishing Little Italy in Manhat­
tan. Anyone who has been to New 
York City’s Little Italy might be better 
off not comparing Pittsburgh’s Little 
Italy — while there’s a significant cul­
tural history of Italians in Bloomfield, the 
locals don’t wear the green, white and red 
on their sleeves.
Although NYC boasts a few blocks of Italian 
restaurants, bakeries, and cafés all teeming 
with first- or second-generation Italian-Ameri- 
cans, Pittsburgh’s Little Italy has a few Italian-named
Since you’ve only seen a little bit of Pitts­
burgh, it can be hard to choose where to go 
next. Friendship and Lawrenceville are 
both experiencing changes that could 
perhaps be called cultural or artistic re­
naissances. And both neighborhoods 
have also experienced an influx of life 
through the younger generations mov­
ing in, renovating, and bringing in 
business. Following in the footsteps 
of Friendship’s and Lawrence- 
ville’s small-scale cultural revi­
talizations is another Pittsburgh 
neighborhood, Bloomfield, 
also known as Pittsburgh’s 
Little Italy.

moving out in hordes, and the elderly are staying. 
At relatively quick paces, neighborhoods are emptying 
out. Right now, however, Bloomfield seems to be regain­
ing its footing as an area of interest. A cancer center, a 
children’s hospital, and a new hotel all bring new job op­
portunities and with that, hopefully, an economic boost. 
The influx of such huge businesses to the area brings a 
new dynamic to Bloomfield. “You’re starting to see real 
estate values increase,” noted Ken Zeff, owner of the local 
coffehouse chain Crazy Mocha. Harrington added, “The 
attractions are bringing in new people ... who aren’t Ital­
ian.”
In its heyday, Bloomfield offered plenty for the people it 
had to cater to. There was the popular Plaza Theatre and 
the church. Bloomfield was always a fairly tiny neighbor­
hood, never quite comparable to the busier parts of any 
cities. But that was the charm of the area.
An innocently entertaining article appeared Septem­
ber 5, 1999, in the Tribune-Review about “Bloom­
field legends,” including everyone from “Harry Greg, 
a middleweight world-championship boxer,” to Tom 
Savini, the filmmaker behind Night of the Living 
Dead. Also included in the list of legends is David L. Law­
rence, once governor of Pennsylvania, and “one local 
woman, Anna Demarco, a 101-year-old tarantella dancer, 
[who] was only supposed to be an extra ... in a Cesar 
Romero film,” but wound up being paid after she kissed 
Romero in a scene at Mass.
Bloomfield was once a fairly exciting, culturally charged 
neighborhood in Pittsburgh, but what about now? It has 
the potential to become a great college hangout. Zeff said 
in an interview at his shop that both Duquesne University 
and University of Pittsburgh students already frequent 
the area. He told how his experience running a shop in 
Lawrenceville was indicative of the promise Bloomfield 
held for the near future.
“This area really hasn’t changed dramatically, but you 
can really start to see it changing gradually with the 
children’s hospital,” he said. “The land values have in­
creased.” The reason that most Carnegie Mellon students 
haven’t discovered Bloomfield yet — aside from its lack 
of amazing places to visit—is the distance from campus.
While Little Italy isn’t extremely far away, it is only acces­
sible to students without a car by the Pittsburgh Transit 
Authority’s 54C bus.
And if you’re looking for food in Pittsburgh, Bloomfield 
will be on your agenda: for Italian food alone, both Del’s 
Bar and Ristorante DelPizzo receive great reviews on 
their authenticity.
Although not entirely Italian, Tessaro’s unique history 
stems from its origins as a rock-and-roll club, cooking 
burgers in garbage cans outside on the street. It’s become 
a little more classy since then, and has moved indoors. 
Tessaro’s has great burgers (good enough that this writer 
heard about them from two complete strangers on an air­
plane), and a very “chill” atmosphere.
Crazy Mocha is almost completely detached from any­
thing culturally “Italian.” It has a good coffeeshop lo­
cale, and it has sister sites in Shadyside (on Ellsworth) 
and Oakland (across from Uncle Sam’s Subs), as well 
as in the newly-constructed SouthSide Works. If you 
are in Bloomfield already, you’ll be joining the scores 
of other local college students already there for an af­
ternoon caffeine hit.
Speaking of not-so-Italian shops, Bloomfield is also 
home to a bakery, a Starbucks, a W.G. Grinders, a tattoo 
parlor, a women’s (old women’s) clothing store, a barber 
shop, and a few other small restaurants. Although these 
shops are not worth the trip by themselves, they are good 
places to stop while in Little Italy.
The strong Italian culture is leaving Little Italy, but in its 
place a new culture of young students and potential busi­
nesses is slowly leaking into the area. With local home* 
grown organizations like the Bloomfield Business Asso­
ciation running alongside UPMC’s future hospital, land 
value is looking to start spiking in just a few years. With 
Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods, the rule has always been “re­
vival of the fittest” — and Bloomfield is looking to climb 
out into the light.

Real World advice
The casting director and the notorious “Miz” share secrets of the show
If you haven’t yet used up your fifteen minutes of fame of 
if you’ve ever wanted to get on television, we have some 
useful advice for you! Unless you have been living in a 
box for the last thirteen years, you have seen or at least 
heard of MTV’s hit reality show, The Real World. Instead 
of just watching the show, you now have the chance to be 
a star yourself.
Who: You!
What: A chance of a lifetime: to be cast on The Real 
World
When: Tuesday, September 20, from 10 am to 5 pm 
Where: Boomerang’s Bar and Grille 
3909 Forbes Avenue 
Why: Because you rock! And this is the perfect
opportunity to be on television!
How: Show up with a recent photo that you are
willing to part with forever and ever, an ID, 
and your cute self.
So now that you’re serious about trying out for the role of 
a lifetime, here are some wise words to help you become 
a cast member on the 17th season of The Real World 
from Damon Furberg, the supervising casting director of 
MTV’s hit reality show.
The Tartan: What do you usually look for in a cast 
member?
Furberg: The number one thing is charisma. I can’t 
overstate that. I think that it’s like when you go to a party. 
There’s always one person who’s the center of attention. 
It’s not always"the best looking person. What we’re 
looking for is the person with the magnetic personality. 
Some people are just fascinating. You’re looking for the 
person who is unsheltered. Someone who isn’t going to 
think before they speak — someone who can’t help but 
be themselves. Some people — I call them politicians — 
worry about what people think too much. We’re looking 
for people who aren’t afraid to speak their minds.
The Tartan: What’s the hardest part about being a 
casting director for a show of this caliber?
Furberg: The hardest part is finding new territory, finding 
types of people we haven’t found before, finding a way to 
differentiate this season from the season before, and doing 
something different. This is challenging especially when
you’re running a show like The Real World. You have to 
raise the bar every year and try to top what came before. 
As a casting director you spend a lot of time on the road 
getting interviews. You have to remain sympathetic 
towards people, but remember to be objective at the 
same time. We’re all human beings, and as human 
beings, we like people personally. In the end, you need 
to differentiate between someone you’d like to hang out 
with and someone you want to see on television.
The Tartan: Just to get a feel of your job, could you 
run through a typical day in the life of The Real World's 
casting director?
Furberg: We do casting calls and accept tape submissions. 
When we’re in the office we spend a lot of time watching 
the tapes people send in. We decide who we like from 
those. Then we conduct interviews over the phone. If 
we’re interested, then we do more interviews in the 
office. A lot of time is spent promoting the casting calls, 
and figuring out ways to get people to cast in calls who 
otherwise wouldn’t come out. We want to tap into parts 
of the population we haven’t tapped into yet, so we spend 
a lot of time and effort getting the word out.
When we get on the road, we do casting calls and brief 
interviews. Usually we see hundreds of people in groups 
of 10, get an overview of what types of people appeal to 
us. Everyone uses different techniques. Playing party 
games such as “Two Truths and a Lie,” asking people 
individual questions like “Are your parents proud of you? 
What’s your biggest fear? Tell what’s interesting about 
yourself,” helps give us a sense of what people are like.
A lot of people are hung up about what the best answer 
is. But it’s all about having an answer and being truthful. 
Afterwards, all the casting directors get together and 
discuss who we met and who we want to see more of. 
We decide who to call back for the next day, and then 
it becomes a process of narrowing down the choices we 
have. It’s a pretty democratic process.... The process is 
designed the way it is because these people have to 
sustain an audience’s interest for months.
The Tartan: Which cast member do you most regret 
choosing?
Furberg: I don’t regret choosing anyone. If I feel bad, 
it’s because the person didn’t have a good time. We 
don’t want to put people in uncomfortable situations.
It’s boring, it’s not nice, and people fighting all the time 
gets old really fast. In the general sense, there are times I 
watched the show and felt...wow, this person isn’t having 
a great time.
The Tartan: Even though a lot of things happen 
throughout the week, how do you guys choose which 
segments to use?
Furberg: We have directors. A director on The Real World 
is different from a movie director because the directors 
of The Real World are observers. They sit there and take 
notes on what’s interesting, what story line seems to be 
developing, how people are interacting, and how things 
might turn out. The editors take the information and 
prune it down. There’s a massive amount of information. 
We cover these kids pretty constantly. After they go to 
bed, the crew goes away, but we’re constantly keeping 
an eye on them.
The Tartan: What happens when college students get 
onto the show? Do they take leaves of absence?
Furberg: They take a break from their lives. Normally we 
try to time the show so that it won’t interfere with people 
going to school. A vast majority of the cast members are 
out of high school or already in college. For the most part, 
schools don’t have a problem giving deferrals. If people 
have jobs, sometimes they take a break or quit.
The Tartan: So what’s your advice to young people out 
there who want to get on The Real World?
Furberg: Be yourself. I think especially since the show 
has been on for such a long time, I get people coming in 
saying they will be like so and so, and this immediately 
signals a red flag. We’re looking for something new every 
time, not people who will emulate other people from the 
show. Putting up a front is not really going help in the 
long run....
In every group we get a deer in the headlights. They’re 
so afraid to say the wrong thing. There’s a funny thing 
I’ve noticed about people who come in groups. Someone 
who really wants to be on the show comes along and they 
usually drag a friend. The friend ends up doing really 
well. The more relaxed you are, the better you can shine. 
We’re not trying to put people on the spot or trip them 
up. We just want people to have a light-hearted attitude.
Pillbox. 19 September 2005.

---------------------------------------------------

The Tartan: How has The Real World changed your 
career?
The Miz: Before I did The Real World, I lived in Parma, 
Ohio.... Not knowing what I wanted to do in my life, I 
went to college right after high school because everyone 
did it. Being on The Real World made me realize that I 
could do everything I wanted.
The Tartan: What’s the most important thing you 
learned from The Real World?
The Miz: Look at everything from a positive light, and 
keep telling yourself to do that.
The Tartan: What’s the best advice you want to give to 
people trying out for The Real World?
The Miz: Be yourself. Be entertaining and tell a good 
story. Try out. That’s the most important thing, because 
a lot of people say they want to be on The Real World, but 
they don’t try out for it.
Now that you’ve been equipped with all the necessary 
knowledge to take on an open casting call, what are you 
waiting for? You’ve watched the show. You’ve heard the 
stories. You know what to expect. You probably have 
nothing better to do on Tuesday anyway, so just head out 
to Boomerang’s Bar and Grille and get ready to shine. Be 
yourself. Be cool. Be everything that you can be. And, as 
the Miz suggests on his website: Be good. Be bad. Be Miz. 
Who knows? You might become the next hottest cast 
member on The Real World.
Want some advice from a cast member? Mike “the 
Miz” from Season 10: Back to New York not only got to 
meet celebrities like Christina Aguilera, build new 
relationships, fly an airplane, and go to the Video Music 
Awards, but he was able to emerge from the show 
completely changed from how he had been four years 
prior. Currently training five to seven days a week, the 
Miz is intent on developing his territory in the WWE. 
Sorry ladies, although the Miz is currently single, his 
recent focus is his career. Now, some words of wisdom 
from the man, himself:

One man’s quest for peace in Kashmir
Rushdie answers questions about his controversial publications
Either artistic bravery or demented masochism drives a 
man to write his own death warrant. For Salman Rushdie, 
whose The Satanic Verses incited the then-leader of Iran 
to send out a fatwa calling for his assassination, one 
can safely describe his motivation as the former: It is an 
unparalleled courage spearheaded by a noble love of his 
homeland.
Rushdie, a native of Bombay, India, has continued a 
writing career even after the fateful fatwa incident of 
the early ’90s. On Wednesday, he spoke at the Byham 
Theater on his newest novel, Shalimar the Clown, and
Courtesy of doublewhammy.com
Author of Shalimar the Clown and The Satanic Verses, 
Salman Rushdie has been the target of much criticism and 
controversy.
in this promotion brushed the issue most dear to him — 
Kashmir, the desecrated region of dispute between India 
and Pakistan.
Rushdie’s latest book concerns revenge and a tangled web 
of love. The novel opens with the performer Shalimar’s 
murder of the American ambassador to India for seducing 
his wife, Boonyi. Flashing back to Shalimar’s childhood, 
the story then begins an exposition on the childhood 
sweethearts who became Hindu dancers in a traveling 
troupe. It tells of the troupe’s performance before the 
unscrupulous ambassador and how he abducted Boonyi 
to America. Shalimar’s ex-wife falls into bad habits and 
becomes what Rushdie calls a “bloated” version of her 
former self.
Rushdie peppered his readings with comedic asides 
and more light-heartedness than the novel’s plot would 
seem to allow. “I don’t like books that preach,” he said. 
One part of the novel concerning the military incursion 
into Kashmir has a Catch-22-style section discussing 
the humorous logic of military men. “I lean toward 
comedy,” he said, “but serious things must be looked 
at.... Sometimes issues are so bright that it’s hard to look 
at them, like the sun.”
The issue that pervades Shalimar the Clown is Kashmir, 
which Rushdie describes as “the heart” of his work — a 
Garden of Eden—but not without its snakes. His personal 
ties with the area gave his talk weight and pathos, and the 
comedy slowly ebbed as the subject of Kashmir came to 
the fore.
The theme that fills Shalimar and connects it with 
Kashmir concerns repentance and forgiveness. Rushdie 
explained: “I have found that there is no causal relation 
between the two parts of this theme.... Those who repent
are often not forgiven, and those who are forgiven often 
do not repent. It is a double paradox.” The ambassador 
in Shalimar, for instance, commits acts of defiled morals 
and receives sanction and exoneration from blame even 
without penitence. Boonyi, however, repents with all of 
her soul for her betrayal of Shalimar. In a very moving 
scene read by Rushdie, Boonyi returns to her home and 
castrates herself, a ruined woman, before her village 
and family — but does not receive forgiveness. Rushdie 
drew the poignant parallel from this tragedy to Kashmir’s 
irreparable state.
Rushdie concluded his speech with the most dramatic 
of all the evening’s excerpts. He read to his audience 
one of the tragic passages in the novel — a description 
of the military “crackdown” on Boonyi’s hometown. In 
a masterful reading that could only have its provenance 
in experience, Rushdie elicited the heart-breaking tale of 
a fallen paradise with no chance for rebirth. He told the 
listeners that tears came often as he wrote such passages, 
and their sorrow can only be matched by the skill with 
which Rushdie penned and orated them.
In a question-and-answer session, Rushdie explained that 
he believes there is some hope for peace in Kashmir. The 
destruction of Rushdie’s beloved valley, represented in 
the novel by the annihilation of the beautiful relationship 
between Shalimar and Boonyi, was total and catastrophic, 
but he sees the situation improving. He called its former 
state “valuable and rare,” and said the need to write about 
its downfall was extraordinarily personal after it was torn 
apart by terrorists and the Indian military. Although 
Shalimar the Clown tells of an absolute tragedy, Rushdie 
finds hope even in the darkness of war.

HOROSCOPES
BY LARA VOIGT
ARIES March 21 - April 19: As much as you think you may deserve it, the star 
system doesn’t feel like giving you a break, so this week will be hard and it will 
be stressful. At least you found out early!
TAURUS April 20 - May 20: As nice as the weather may seem, make sure 
you keep a working umbrella with you at all times. Consider yourself warned: 
Whatever you did last week really ticked someone off.
GEMINI May 21 - June 21: You know your family's proud of you for being such 
a good chemist, but do you really think spending your entire Friday afternoon at 
the lab is necessary? Go take a breath of fresh air: Those red spots you’re seeing 
aren’t new discoveries, they’re just the ethanol fumes getting to your head.
CANCER June 22 - July 22: Good job! You have a date for the weekend! Play it 
cool, take it slow, and remember: As much as you may think a night filled with 
the new Harry Potter video game would be the perfect date, play it on the safe 
side and just take her to dinner... off campus.
LEO July 23 - August 22: You’ve been studying really, really hard for the past 
week and a half. Don’t worry, it will all pay off, you just have to fight the urges 
to fling that physics textbook off the roof of ’Schlag for a few more days. After 
that, where that textbook goes is your prerogative.
VIRGO August 23 - September 22: Mars and Earth are aligned this week, and 
the red planet will be bringing some hostility into your life around Wednesday. 
If you think this is the week to talk to your roommate about his toenail-picking 
habits, think again.
LIBRA September 23 - October 22: The first few weeks are over now, and 
suddenly the real work has jumped up behind you and hit you with a keyboard. 
Don’t be surprised if you’re working into the wee hours of the morning, but keep 
in mind that when your computer screen starts reading your program back to 
you in German, it’s time to go outside.
SCORPIO October 23 - November 21; Venus is taking some time to wreak 
havoc with "the balance," so do something you have reservations about — it 
may come out better than you ever could have dreamed. Or it will go horribly 
wrong; you have a 50/50 chance. I suggest flipping a coin.
SAGITTARIUS November 22 - December 21: Last week was good for you, but 
not for a fellow Libra who happens to work in the food industry. So be careful 
where you eat this week; the chicken is not supposed to have green stuff in 
it!
CAPRICORN December 22 - January 19: This week is going to be full decisions 
for you. Keep your abilities in mind when you make them — no one should 
have to remind you that playing rugby for the first time against people double 
your size is a bad idea.
AQUARIUS January 20 - February 18: While not everyone is having a good 
week, you, on the other hand, are in line for an amazing week. Don’t ask why, 
just trust that things will work out in your favor for a couple of days at least.
PISCES February 19 - March 20: With all the sunshine and good weather, 
you’re probably looking to make a change in the relationship department. So 
are many others this week — so take the plunge and introduce yourself to, well, 
anyone. But if things don’t work out... there’s always next week.
