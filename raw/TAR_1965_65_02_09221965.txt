Rebellious Freshmen 
Defy Traditions Test
This year's freshman class continued the tradition of avoiding the 
Traditions Test.
Mimeographed signs reading, “The Traditions Test is cancelled by 
order of Dean Letch** kept most of the freshman class from taking 
the test which was given on September 18 in the gymnasium.
Besides the mimeographed 
signs, a few painted posters were 
hung at strategic points on the 
campus. In blue and purple let­
tering, a sign on the tennis court 
fence read, “Due to conditions 
under control: the Traditions Test 
is canned."
Of the approximately 75 frosh 
taking the test, only a handful 
actually answered the one and only 
question in the test: “Why should 
freshmen not have to take the Tra­
ditions test?*’
Most of the frosh present either 
tore up their tests or made paper 
airplanes of them. Then they left 
the gym.
By Order of the Dean

Financial Aid Program
To Reach $1.4 Million
Financial aid awarded at Carnegie Tech during the 1965-66 academic year will total approximately 
$1,400,000 according to George K. Brown, dean of the Division of Student Affairs.
The aid money is derived from several sources. A substantial portion is allocated from the Carnegie 
Tech budget; a larger portion comes from outside sources; the remainder, through loans and part-time 
student employment. Dean Brown anticipates this year, in approximate figures, an $89,000 increase in the 
Carnegie Tech allocation, a $100,000 increase in loans, and another $100,000 increase in student employ­
ment income.
Aid is awarded in several forms. 
Scholarships are awarded to in­
coming freshmen who have mani­
fested a high aptitude and achieve­
ment level in high school, and to 
upperclass students who have out­
standing academic records and 
whose qualities are indicative of 
significant future growth.
Grants-in-aid are awarded to 
those students whose predicted 
or cumulative factor makes them 
ineligible for scholarship con­
sideration, but whose other quali­
ties warrant an award.
Scholarships and grants-in-aid 
are gift awards, involving virtually 
no financial obligation on the part 
of the recipient.
Loans are awarded to full-time 
students in good academic stand­
ing and who have no failing grades 
in any course. Two loan programs 
are offered at Carnegie Tech. 
The first of these is the National 
Defense Education Act (NDEA) 
Loan Program. Students who have 
been awarded NDE A loans pay no 
interest on them while in school. 
After graduation, however, stu­
dents have ten years to repay the 
loan at an interest rate of three 
percent on the balance. For indivi­
duals entering such professions as 
teaching, nursing, and other forms 
of social work may be forgiven 
ten percent of the loan per year 
up to five years.
The second loan program is 
the Carnegie Tech Loan Program. 
Carnegie Tech loans are repay­
able immediately after graduation 
at four percent interest. The 
school, however, according to Dean 
Brown, generally interviews reci­
pients of these loans to determine 
their capacity to repay the loan. 
Arrangements are made to insure 
repayment as soon as possible, 
depending on the student’s ability

to pay. This procedure, accord­
ing to Dean Brown, gets the loan 
“off the students back” sooner 
than in the case of the NDE A 
loans and returns the money to 
Carnegie Tech relatively early for 
use by other students.
Carnegie Tech Financial aid also 
has the responsibility to secure 
part-time employment for students 
in good academic standing. The 
number of hours of employment 
per week is based on the stu­
dent's academic achievement and 
schedule of courses.
Qualification For Aid
To qualify for financial aid, a 
student must be either a full time 
undergraduate, or a transfer stu­
dent in good academic standing, 
or a student accepted for admis­
sion. The College Scholarship Ser­
vice (CSS) Parents' Confidential 
Statement serves as the means of 
applications for financial aid.
The amount of financial aid and 
the manner in which the forms of 
aid are packaged is determined 
primarily on the basis of finan­
cial need. The Parents' Confiden­
tial Statement serves as the basis 
for the evaluation of financial need. 
The form, however, has become 
the object of criticism by some 
parents, who claim that the state­
ment is a violation of their pri­
vacy. As a result of this criti­
cism and questions which have 
arisen concerning the statement's 
accuracy, the CSS is working on 
establishing a new or modified 
criterion for the evaluation of the 
financial need of applicants.
There are cases of corporate 
or honorary grants which do not 
involve financial need, but only 
academic proficiency. The ex­
ception lies in policy or contractual 
commitments between Carnegie 
Tech and the corporation. The 
Westinghouse grants fall in this 
category.
Duration of Award
Financial aid awards are made 
for a period of one year with annual 
reapplication necessary for con­
tinued consideration for aid. The 
school, however, makes the as­
sumption that the aid will continue 
over a four year period, but 
chooses, according to Dean Brown, 
to commit itself only on a yearly 
basis. Academic standing is re­
viewed each semester, and, if the 
student is not in good academic 
standing, or is on disciplinary 
probation, his aid may be dis­
continued. Students who become 
ineligible after the fall semester, 
however, may benefit from contin­
ued financial aid in the form of a 
loan for the duration of the 
academic year.
Students receiving gifts awards, 
(scholarships and grants-in-aid) 
will be subject to proportionate 
annual increases or decreases in 
the awards based on Carnegie 
Tech costs, the availability of 
loan funds, and student need. These 
fluctuations are on the order of 
$100 to $200. Furthermore, the 
amount of aid granted in the form 
of loans will increase in a fashion 
corresponding to the decrease in 
gift awards.
Students Draining
Emergency Funds
The Emergency Loan Fund, which constitutes money available to 
students for emergency purposes, has insufficient funds for students* 
needs at this time.
Many students have not only failed to pay back their loans, but have 
offered no explanation for their delinquency.
These students, in borrowing

the money and not paying it back, 
have almost exhausted the funds 
in this branch of the financial 
aid department. The money in the 
fund was the result of several 
large contributions.
A second letter, the first being 
written last semester, was sent 
1 to students with overdue loans re­
questing that they return the money 
as soon as possible.
The poor response to both of 
these letters has made it neces­
sary for the Administration to 
find other solutions to the pro­
blem. Unpaid emergency loans 
may be placed on the bills of stu­
dents still attending Carnegie 
Tech.
Although past donors presented 
the stipulation that if the student 
could not pay he would not be 
forced to, students must show 
their Intent in these financial deal­
ings.
Student^ presently requesting fi­
nancial aid must sign a document 
stating approximately how long 
th«y will hold the money.

Fraternity Council Hopes 
For Continued Betterment
by Robert J. Fritz 
President, Council of Fraternity Presidents
The Council of Fraternity Presidents has as its purpose the maintain­
ing of a strong fraternity system. CFP both governs fraternity activities 
and plans such inter-fraternity events as Greek Week and Greek Sing. 
With the exception of fraternity
rush, this year's program will be 
similar to previous years. CFP 
has usually left rush to the indi­
vidual houses but this year will 
take a major role itself.
Many men who did not join 
fraternities or joined as upper­
classmen look back and wish they 
had pledged as freshmen. One 
reason they did not do so was be­
cause they lacked information 
about fraternities. Thus we feel 
it is our duty to tell freshmen 
as much as possible about fra­
ternities.)Our fraternity system is unique 
in many ways. We can contrast the 
physical excellence of our houses, 
the quality of our food, our social 
and athletic programs, and the low­
ness of our costs with many other 
universities and come out favor­ably.
Tours of fraternity houses be­
gin informal rush this Friday. 
Tour groups will be organized 
at 7 p.m. in the Skibo ballroom 
and will then proceed to the houses.
I encourage all freshmen to at­
tend the tours and the parties later 
this semester. They're free and 
they're a lot of fun. The events 
are all conducted in a very relax­
ed atmosphere. Freshmen don't 
need an invitation to come to a 
party. They'll be welcome at any 
house whether they have intentions 
of joining or not. A lot of our 
best fraternity men did not in­
tend to join at first either.
Last year was a good one set 
for the fraternity system. Our 
scholarship average and the num­
ber of new members were both 
higher than at any time during 
the 1960's.
A CFP-sponsored tutoring pro­
gram for students who needed spe­
cial help met with notable success 
and will be continued this year. 
Perhaps most important of all, the 
level of cooperation between the 
fraternity system andtheCarnegie 
Tech administration reached an 
all-time high. We are confident 
that with a little hard work we 
can do even better this year.

Pittsburgh Scientists Solve 
Meteor- Crater Mystery
Two Pittsburgh scientists were part of a team which discovered 
that a huge natural earth satellite may have broken up in the atmosphere 
centuries ago, distributed many thousands of meteorites and produced 
several impact craters in northern Argentina.
The scientists were Truman P.
Kohman, professor of chemistry 
and chairman of the new program 
on Earth and Astronomical
Sciences at Carnegie Tech and 
Theodore E. Bunch, a research 
scientist in the department of Earth 
and Planetary Sciences at the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh.
They took part in an expedition 
led by William A. Cassidy, of
Columbia University, New York, 
and supported by the National 
Science Foundation.
A report of the findings of the 
expedition appears in the latest

Editorial!Forum For Discussion
It has long been a belief of this newspaper that there is an unnecessary 
and tragic lack of communication on this campus. Students, faculty, and 
administration alike are all guilty of this.
To this end, the Tartan regards itself as a forum for discussions, as a 
conference table for legitimate complaints, and as a billboard for dis­
play of provocative and serious thinking. We extend a sincere invitation 
to the students, faculty, and administration of Carnegie Tech to utilize 
the Tartan for all these purposes.
As students we not only desire to know what is happening on campus, 
but what decisions are being made on an administrative level that will 
concern us; from an increase in tuition to planning for new dormitories. 
Not only must these decisions be communicated, but the rationale, 
or reasons for reaching a particular decision must be explained.
Just as important, the administration needs student opinion as a basis 
for decision-making policy. For without it, the administrative decisions 
can only be based on a'guess’ as to what students need and want. An ex­
ample of such a «guess' can be found in our pseudo-student union, Skibo.
On the other hand, student opinion as expressed through the Tartan 
cite the change in library hours, a topic which received considerable 
editorial attention, and the investigation currently being undertaken by 
the Division of Student Affairs working with a student committee on 
proposals for a real student Union.
This newspaper now states that it will speak for all students; it shall 
be the policy of this newspaper to print any view on any subject by any 
member of the Carnegie Tech academic community, assuming that the 
authors of such statements show a definite regard, consideration, and 
respect for the intelligence of our audience. The Tartan must, in all fair­
ness to its power as a college and an American newspaper, reserve the 
right to discriminate among articles with regard to their usefulness 
to the reading public.
Anything which flagrantly disregards the rules of logic, common 
sense, and above all, fact, is by its own right, incorrect.
We invite the students, faculty, and administration to make use of 
the Tartan as a vehicle of communication, and we challenge the aca­
demic community of Carnegie Tech to alleviate this present lack of 
communication for the betterment of the university.
From The Middle Of The Bus
by Michael Malakoff
Jackson
The tension is high as you unload the bus at the MFDP office. One 
does not know what to expect. We are quickly transported to a mass 
assembly. We note the driver is afraid. He stays in the right lane 
and is constantly looking for police. None are observed.
The meeting is poorly attended (about 400 people). This is not sur­
prising since over 600 people are still in the Jackson jail. Mrs. Devon, 
the fourth district contestant in the challenge speaks. She is followed 
by ministers and some of those that have been released from jail for 
physical reasons. Many have bandages on their hands and some have 
fresh cuts exposed and stitches which can be seen. This is Mississippi 
justice. This is the American way of life for the southern Negro and 
the white sympathizer.
Julian Bond, the newly elected Negro representative from Georgia 
speaks. “There are people’s politics and politician’s politics.” It is 
obvious the latter is being followed. Although the MFDP might not 
unseat the five Mississippi delegates, he is one example that the party 
is accomplishing a lot. The meeting ends with “We shall overcome.” 
The song and the swaying back and forth calms everyone. The song 
ends and the hall is quickly emptied. We enter station wagons that take 
us to Mt. Beulah, a Junior College outside of Jackson that MFDP 
was using. We go in a caravan with the front and rear cars connected 
by wireless radio. As we ride along in the darkness, I think of Mrs. 
Louzzo. The station wagon I ride in holds about three times its capac­
ity. The temperature is about 100 degrees and our bodies are drenched 
when we arrive. The accommodations are better than expected. It is 
the first time in 11 days that most of us have slept on a mattress.
After a station wagon trip the next day, we again find ourselves in 
Jackson. We order lunch which consisted of chicken, rice, beans,, 
bread, coleslaw and a drink for 52Ç. That day, we discuss the 
demonstrations that are tentatively planned for the next day. It is 
inevitable that we will be jailed if we attempt the march to the 
capital. 600 people have been in jail for two weeks. We know that there 
will be police brutality. This is weighed against the moral support such 
a march will have with the people in jail and increased expense to 
the city of food and police supervision, which will eventually make it 
comply with the U.S. Constitution. The group is divided on what is to be 
done. It is to be decided that night. We march.
Morewood Improves
Dining Room Facilities
by Selene Clements
Improvements in the dining fa­
cilities at Morewood Gardens were 
instituted during the summer.
Because of increased enroll­
ment at Morewood Gardens, addi-1 
tions were made “to provide quick-1 
er service and a more enjoyable 
atmosphere in which to dine.”
The school painted the dining 
room walls yellow. It also install 
led an infra - red heating system 
at the food distribution counter 
and placed beverages in the cen­
tral dining area. The beverages1 
wert moved into the dining room 
to “eliminate unnecessary con­
gestion.” (Morewood residents 
may now have as many glasses of 
milk, coffee or tea as they wish.)
Modern facilities were added in 
the kitchen. These include new 
ovens, fryers and griddles. They 
were acquired in order that “the 
food may arrive at the counter in 
a speedier manner/’ Future plans 
are now underway to equip the 
dishroom windows to handle dishes! 
more efficiently.
In addition to the improvements 
in equipment, Food Service has! 
scheduled a continental (cold) 
breakfast. The meal is served fromi 
9 to 9;30 a.m.
As Students We Desire To Know
The Search
For Understanding
By James Panepinto
Non-violent Approach
War has consistently beenoneof 
the greatest detriments to man­
kind, and man’s methods of con­
trolling this evil have, for the 
most part, been highly ineffective. 
Since the end of World War II, 
an ever increasing number of 
philosophers have argued that 
peaceful co-operation should be 
the primary goal of a nation, ex­
cept in the extreme ^ases where 
a nation’s sovereignty is at stake. 
Even though much theory has been 
expounded, little attempt has been 
made to put any of the ideas into 
practice.
Politicians hestitate to discard 
their old “proven” methods of 
settling disputes. The show of pow­
er and force seems to dominate 
their diplomatic vocabulary, even 
when they are negotiating toward 
understanding. Many do not realize 
that a system of non-violence does 
not leave out any effective form 
of conflict resolution. One of 
Gandhi’s major contributions to 
this world is the suggestion that 
one should try to liquidate the 
antagonism present, not the 
antagonists themselves. This 
theory is not really very pro­
found, but it is often neglected by 
all countries in their diplomatic 
relations. Most nations are willing 
to try and solve the problem in 
only a very limited and unor­
ganized manner. Most nations pro­
pose that they will compromise 
only so far—when they believe they 
have been pushed over the un­
measurable “point of no-return,” 
they stop talking and start fight­
ing.
Thus far, my argument has been 
mostly generalizations. Now it is 
appropriate to describe a specific 
method of handling conflicts which 
will eliminate the need for vio­
lence. As future engineers and 
scientists, we are taught to accu­
mulate and analyze factual infor­
mation concerning a problem we 
wish to solve. A nation should do 
the same—all efforts should be 
made to obtain an unbiased exposi­
tion of the main facts relating to the 
conflict. Historical records show 
countless cases where this neces­
sary factor to settlement was ne­
glected.
Secondly, numerous meetings 
should be held to clarify essential 
long-range interests which the 
parties have in common. This sets 
the basis for co-operating with 
one another and shows that the 
attainment of common interests 
depends upon the settlement of the 
conflict. A limited goal for im­
mediate action acceptable to both 
parties in terms of common in­
terests should be formulated. It 
is likely that this limited goal, 
even if completely unrelated to the 
basic conflict, can help resolve 
a part or aspect of the struggle 
merely by providing a basis for 
co-operation between the parties.
In case of persistent resistance 
from one of the parties concerned, 
patience must not be forgotten and 
a search for a compromise af­
fecting limited interests must con­
tinue without giving up essentials.
If this last alternative fails, 
war probably will result. The non­
violent method should not be con­
demned on this improbable re- 
sult--it must be judged on its 
value as a framework for resolving 
conflict. The framework is logical

Freshman Praises 
Camp Experience
Editor, the Tartan:
I attended the most enjoyable 
event in my schooling: freshman 
camp. Without freshman camp I 
would have been too shy to speak 
with others,. I have learned what 
fun it is to participate with others 
in doing activities. I believe every 
freshman should get this glorifying 
experience.

Tech Buys
New Tract 
Near Park
Last week Carnegie Tech pur­
chased 5-1/3 acres of property 
located at 5321 Northumberland 
Avenue near the Schenley Park 
golf course.
The land, part of the estate of 
the late Adeline L. Spear, held 
a 2-1/2 story residence and other 
minor buildings. These were in­
cluded in the purchase.
According to Richard D. Strath- 
meyer, vice president for business 
affairs, the institution has no im­
mediate plans for the new acqui­
sition. Said Strathmeyer, “The 
trustees and administration of 
Carnegie Tech constantly antic­
ipate future needs. Purchases such 
as this allow for the orderly and 
controlled development of Car­
negie Tech and enable us to co­
operate better with the community 
in the vital area of neighborhood 
planning.”
The latest purchase raises the 
total acreage of the Oakland cam­
pus to about 90, the total land 
owned by Carnegie Tech to 150 
acres including 63 at Saxonburg, 
the site of Tech’s Nuclear Re­
search Center.
Included in Carnegie Tech’s plans 
are an increase in enrollment from 
the present 3,700 to approximately 
4,800 with a substantial increase 
in the number of faculty.
and adds some orderly methods to 
the confused world of diplomacy.
Gandi’s non-violent methods 
were successful in resolving in­
ternational differences with Great 
Britain and internal difficulties 
such as interracial conflicts be­
tween the Hindus and Moslems and 
management versus labor con­
flicts. America has many problems 
in much the same areas and they 
probably could be reduced through 
the non-violence techniques. TTiis 
philosophy could be tested through 
the issues of civil rights and labor 
versus management before extend­
ing it to the world arena and in­
ternational problems.

Kibbee Discusses Student-Faculty Relations
Prexy’s Assistant Analyzes 
Attitudes, Values ? Motives
The title of my talk this evening is Expectations and Reality. If, in 
the fashion of an earlier time, a subtitle was expected, I would suggest 
something like — «Blood on the Mall" and go on to describe it as a tale 
wherein our young hero in search of the magic diploma outwits the wiley, 
sadistic agents of the Mighty Robot and arrives bloodied but unbowed at 
the Great Commencement Hall.---------------------------——--------------
Before beginning, however, I 
have a confession to make. Sev­
eral months ago when I accepted 
the privilege of talking to you this 
evening, I hadn’t the foggiest no­
tion of what I might say. But hav­
ing a daughter about to enter 
college, I was confident that some 
useful suggestions could be gotten 
from that quarter. When prodded 
for ideas, her response was devas­
tating — «Honestly,* she said, «1 
can’t think of anything you might 
say which would be of the least 
interest to them!" The president 
of Barnard College confirmed this 
ego-shattering opinion when she 
observed in a recent talk that 
young people today do not really 
rebel against authority, they simply 
refuse to listen.
The prospect of saying some­
thing of little interest to 350 non­
listeners is not particularly 
attractive and a wiser head and 
humbler heart would have hastily 
arranged to be in Chicago or San 
Francisco today and gracefully 
withdrawn from the arena.
This would be the coward's way 
out and, although I am as much a 
coward as the next fellow, I have 
learned that it is not appropriate 
to act like one. Then too, there is 
always the possibility that my 
daughter could be wrong — it has 
happened before and, although the 
younger generation does not listen 
to Dr. Parks, it does not nec­
essarily follow that they would not 
listen to me. Having happily de­
luded myself in this fashion, I ge- 
gan to construct this evening’s 
talk.
The Image of College
Within the last quarter century 
the clever cliff-clingers on Madi­
son Avenue have created a great 
commercial enterprise out of the 
process of «image-building*.«Im­
age* is what people believe to be 
so about any person, product or 
institution. It distinguishes subtly 
between what is and what one 
thinks is and, for commercial pur­
poses at least, it assumes that 
only the latter is really important. 
This distinction is as old as the 
Greeks, roughly approximating the 
conflicting philosophies of nomin­
alists and realists who unfor­
tunately for them, failed to seethe 
commercial possibilities in their 
disagreement.
The problem for professional 
image-builders is one of devising 
means of depicting their clients 
or their clients’ products in a 
manner that will achieve a pre­
determined result whether it is to 
purchase what he sells, vote for 
him on election day, or merely to 
feel kindly toward him when the 
going gets rough.
Before image-building became a 
profession, people always had im­
ages or ideas about almost every­
thing for which they had a word. If 
this image was of something they 
had neither seen nor experienced, 
their ideas about it may be either 
close to reality or very far from 
it, depending in large part upon the 
ways in which the idea was formed.
For example, when one consi­
ders the word «murderer*, he us­
ually conjures up a vision of some 
disheveled, crude, tough armed 
with knife, gun or garrote, lurking 
in the darkness to pounce upon an 
k unsuspecting victim. Seldom do we 
think of the quiet, friendly gentle­
man next door who may be care­
fully dropping poison into his wife's 
coffee cup nor, strangely enough, 
do we ever think of a woman.
Similarly, the word «Africa* e- 
vokes in many of us visions of a 
vast expanse of lush green forests, 
roamed by wild beasts and by half- 
naked savages padding about brand­
ishing spears and listening ex­
pectantly for the throbbing beat to 
the tom-tom. And so it goes. You 
or I could list thousands of mental 
stereotypes that are evoked by 
words.
How we developed these images 
would require a tour-de-force of 
psychological detective work — 
perhaps it was a story our mother 
read to us years ago, a movie or 
TV show we saw, something we 
heard someone say, a book we 
read — it really doesn't matter. 
We have these ideas or images and 
we will hold on to them until we see 
or experience the reality itself — 
and even then they will be difficult 
to surplant.
Freshmen Have Images
So it is that each of you sitting 
here this evening has an «image* 
or an «idea* of college in general 
and of Carnegie Tech in particular. 
It is not a common image, one that 
is shared by each of you, because 
how each of you perceives college 
and Carnegie Tech depends upon 
what you have heard and from 
whom, what you have read, how 
much you have personally seen of 
a college campus and to a large ex­
tent what, if anything, you hope to 
get out of college and what, if any­
thing, you intend to put into it.
In recent years, particularly 
during the past decade, colleges 
and college or iented research 
groups have begun a rather inten­
sive study of students. In doing so, 
they have worked on the assump­
tion that if the institution knows 
more about the ability, achieve­
ment, motivation, backgrounds, 
aspirations and values of its stu­
dents, it can deal with them more 
realistically and perhaps reduce 
the tensions that develop in them 
and on the campus. There are, for 
example, almost a hundred pub­
lished articles on the problem of 
college drop-outs alone, and a 
rapidly growing literature on stu­
dent attributes, attitudes and val­
ues.
Arena of Interactions
I do not wish to deprecate these 
studies because I believe they have 
been useful and may become even 
more valuable in the future. But 
the campus is an arena of inter­
actions between faculty and stu­
dents, faculty and administration, 
administration and students, and 
among the members within each of 
these groups.
While students are being probed 
at a merry rate, there has been 
precious little study of the faculty 
or the administration. The reasons 
for this are fairly obvious. Students 
caught early in their careers sub­
mit readily to investigations of this 
sort either because they believe 
they are part of the program or 
possibly because they too are cur­
ious about themselves. However, 
the potential investigator who 
wishes to dissect the psyche of a 
faculty member or administrator 
stands a better than even chance of 
being told to *go to hell*.
Yet many faculty members and 
administrators do try to understand 
students both as a group and as In­
dividuals. And I am sure that their 
effort to understand students Is 
greater than the effort of students 
to understand either the faculty or
the administration. My purpose this 
evening is to encourage you in this 
direction by attempting to expose 
the faculty and the administration 
in human dimensions (a character­
istic not usually accorded them by 
students); to explain how they view 
their role and why and to point up 
how this view will tend to conflict 
with yours.
In the process, I may shatter 
some illusions, but this is not my 
intention. Your illusions would be 
shattered sooner or later by ex­
perience and my hope is that by 
confronting reality honestly now, 
you may attribute your later ex­
periences to something other than 
callousness, sadism, pettiness, 
malice or those other pejoratives 
that normally spring to mind in 
times of disappointment and crises.
Let us begin with the faculty. I do 
not know where you developed your 
image of the faculty, but if you have 
derived your concept of a faculty 
member from literature, several 
models are possible.
Myopic Prof?
Do you see him in what is per­
haps his most familiar and idealis­
tic pose; what I shall call the «Mr. 
Chips* image or «Old Prof Fondly 
Remembered*? In this view, he e- 
merges as a dignified, middle-aged 
gentleman peering myopicallyover 
his spectacles — reserved but ap­
proachable, firm but fair, demand­
ing but understanding, idio­
syncratic and somewhat detached 
from the world around him, witty in 
a «square* sort of way, dedicated 
to teaching and personally interest­
ed in «his boys and girls".
Or do you see him as one of C. P. 
Snow's Masters — Mr.Chipsean in 
many ways but caught up in per­
sonal problems and professional 
conflicts, exhibiting the faults of all 
men — egotism, pettiness, dup­
licity and hate?
Or is he more like the characters 
that people the college novels of 
Bernard Malamud, Phillip Roth and 
Mary McCarthy -- brilliant but 
pompous, egotistical, petty, dis­
honest, gutless, cynical people bent 
on protecting their own egos and 
their own interests with little real 
commitment to their professions 
and even less compassion for their 
fellow man be he colleague or stu­
dent?
Perhaps you have developed your 
image of him from the spate of cur­
rent analysis of the college campus 
triggered by the exposes of «pub­
lish or'perish* at Tufts and Yale or 
what those in the profession might 
refer to as the «recent unpleasant­
ness* at Berkeley. Here one visual­
izes the faculty member as a prac­
titioner rather than a person. He 
emerges as a modern business man 
who also happens to teach. The val­
ues of the modern world have given 
him a new status.
Industry, labor and government 
seek his advice and he sits on the 
boards of corporations and on gov­
ernment commissions. His oppor­
tunities to ascend the public podium 
have increased and the price for his 
wisdom escalated proportionately. 
On campus, where he is seen less 
frequently, most of his time is spent 
on those aspects of his work which 
increase his reputation outside — 
on research, on writing, or on pub­
lic performance. These new de­
mands on his time, coupled with 
ever longer class rosters decrease 
the time he can spend with each 
student and his availability to any 
of them.
Or perhaps you have formed a 
personal image of the faculty mem­
ber out of your own aspirations and 
your own anxieties. Is he just 
another symbol of authority, the 
arbitrary dispenser of grades, the 
currency which in sufficient 
amounts can be exchanged for a de­
gree — the later-day passkey to 
opportunity, security and success? 
Is he, like other adults you must
deal with, an adversary who must 
be carefully handled and manipula­
ted until you are in a position to 
deal with them on your own terms?| There are, I am sure, faculty 
members (perhaps even at Carne­
gie Tech) who approximate each of 
these images. It is equally probable 
that many faculty members partake 
of all of these characteristics in 
differing amounts and at various 
times. Yet none of these is a par­
ticularly useful model for you as 
students to use in viewing the fac­
ulty.
Model of the Faculty
I would like to try to construct a 
model based upon how the faculty 
member views his role, that when 
combined with a realization that 
each is a human being, may better 
explain behavior that on the face of 
it may appear to be arbitrary, 
mean, disinterested or absurd.
The tradition of the modern uni­
versity is threefold -- teaching, 
scholarship or research, and, to 
varying degrees, service to the 
community at any of several lev­
els. The faculty member perceives 
these responsibilities within the 
context of his subject which is the 
object of his fundamental loyalty.
If you ask him what he is, he will 
answer that he is a chemist, an 
artist, an historian or a mathema­
tician — not that he is ateacherat 
Carnegie Tech or Harvard or 
Swarthmore. Professionally and 
intellectually, the physicist atCar- 
negie Tech is closer to the phy­
sicist at Stanford or attheArgonne 
Laboratory or at the Westinghouse 
Research Laboratory than he is to 
the Chemical Engineer down the 
hall from him.
The individual may serve his 
subject and use it to serve him­
self in one or more of a variety of 
ways. He may increase the gen­
eral understanding of it by teach­
ing general courses; he may de­
velop'new professional practi­
tioners by helping to train spe­
cialists (i.e. majors, graduate stu­
dents); he may try to expand what 
is known in the field through re­
search or scholarship; he may ap­
ply his knowledge (to industrial 
process to create ^new products 
that are useful or desirable; he may 
apply it in ways that will enhance 
the security of his country and so 
on. Which of these paths he follows 
will depend in good part upon his 
personal sense of values and the 
way in which he obtains personal 
satisfaction.
Those professionals who have 
associated themselves with uni­
versities have done so because it 
affords them an opportunity to use 
their subject in ways they feel are 
important and satisfying in an at­
mosphere in which they are com­
fortable. It may be that they par­
ticularly enjoy teaching or feel it 
is especially important, or per­
haps they are attracted by the free­
dom it affords them to do the kind 
of research they are interested in, 
or they may like the variety of ways 
in which they can serve — under­
graduate teaching, graduate teach­
ing, research, consultation — that 
a university permits.
Conflict Arises
It is at this point that the first 
fundamental conflict arises be­
tween students and the faculty and 
the university. While the university 
perceives its threefold role of 
teaching, research and service, 
and the faculty member can see 
himself contributing to any or all of 
these functions, the student typi­
cally thinks of the faculty member 
as first and foremost a teacher 
because it is in his role as teacher 
that the student generally encount­
ers him and it is his service as a 
teacher that the student is seeking.
Moreover, undergraduate stu­
dents believe that his primary re­
sponsibility is to them rather than
|to graduate students. Time the fa- 
Iculty member spends on research, 
on writing, on graduate students, 
serving on government committees 
¡or consulting with industry, the un­
dergraduate sees as time stolen 
from him. One cannot blame the un­
dergraduate for looking at the pro­
blem in this way because this is the 
way it affects him. Yet conversely, 
can we blame the faculty member 
whose orientation is completely 
different for being unable to com­
prehend this viewpoint that must 
appear to him to be both parochial 
and selfish?
What eternal law, asks the fa­
culty member, creates a hierarchy 
of activities for the professional 
scholar and places at its pinnacle 
the teaching of undergraduates?
With the university structure he 
accepts his responsibility to teach; 
but why is teaching freshmen more 
important than teaching seniors? 
or graduate students? and why is 
teaching either more important 
than research and scholarship? 
If he measures these alternatives 
against the contribution they make 
to his subject, he might well re­
verse the undergraduate’s hier­
archy. By teaching graduate stu­
dents he is inducting novitiates into 
his own priesthood, by teaching 
¡«majors* he is e nc our aging no­
tices into his intellectual semin­
ary, but by teaching freshmen a 
portion of his effort and skill Is 
being wasted on heretics and agnos­
tics who care not a whit for his 
religion and are exposing them­
selves to him only in the interests 
of academic ecumenicism.
These differing viewpoints of the 
faculty members' role accounts In 
part for the unevenness the student 
perceives in the quality of teaching 
to which he is exposed. He is per­
plexed, and at times outraged, by 
the continued presence in the class­
room of teachers he considers to 
be mediocre at best while those 
whom he considers first-rate are 
at times denied the recognition of 
promotion. Within the total re­
sponsibilities of the university 
(teaching, research and service), 
those who labor in the vineyard ex­
hibit uneven talents. This is a com­
mon condition that can be docu­
mented, I believe, with an analog}' 
from baseball.
Play Ball!
In the composition of a major 
league team you will find those 
who are good-field - no-hit; great 
hitters who endanger their lives 
when they go to the outfield; those 
who hit a lot but not very far and 
those who hit infrequently but with 
great power — at the top are the 
very small percentage of com­
plete ball players — the Mays, 
Mantles, Aarons, Robinsons, Cle­
mentes who do everything well. 
They are easy to remember be­
cause there are so few of them.
Faculty members can be group­
ed in much the same way. There 
are first-class teachers who do 
virtually no research; great scho­
lars who are miserable in the 
classroom; many reasonably good 
teachers who do a modest amount 
of competent research and then at 
the top those very few who com­
bine first-class scholarship and 
great teaching. All make their 
contribution to the total institu­
tional effort but in different ways.
The university, like the base­
ball manager, tries to use the tal­
ents available to it in the best way 
possible. Where the latter com­
bines speed, defense, power and 
consistency to field a team that 
will win, the university combines 
teaching, research and service In 
a way that will best fulfill its mul­
tiple responsibilities.
We have described first an area 
of conflict that seems to arise 
because the professor's responsi­
bilities are defined much more 
narrowly by the student than by

(Maj. Daniel, a test pilot since 1954, is a member 
of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He 
received a B.S. degree in Aeronautical Engineering 
from the University of Oklahoma. In February 
1962, he set world class time-to-climb records in a 
T-38 jet trainer.)
Is the YF-12A the world’s fastest manned aircraft?
It certainly is. On May 1 of this year the YF-12A 
(formerly known as the A-ll) reclaimed the world 
absolute speed record from the USSR. It was 
clocked at 2,062 mph over Edwards Air Force Base.
How big is the YF-12A?
The exact dimensions of the YF-12A have not been 
released yet. But it’s approximately 100 feet long, 
with about a 50-foot wingspan. That’s half again 
as big as our present interceptors!
Is the Air Force training many men 
as pilots these days?
Yes, very definitely. In spite of all you hear about 
unmanned vehicles, the human pilot is still very 
much in the picture. As a matter of fact, the Air 
Force pilot quota is on the increase."
What other kinds of jobs does the Air Force offer?
Since it’s one of the world’s foremost technological 
organizations, the Air Force has plenty of openings 
for scientists and engineers. There are also many 
challenging and varied administrative-managerial 
positions.
What do I have 'to do to become 
an Air Force officer?
Air Force ROTC is the best way to get started as an
Air Force officer. The new two-year Air Force 
ROTC program makes this method available to 
men who have already completed a year or two of 
their college education. For college graduates, if 
you did not take advantage of ROTC, you can 
still get started through Air Force Officer Training 
School (OTS), a three-month course open to both 
men and women.
Can I keep up my studies while 
Fm in the Afar Force?
The Air Force encourages its men and women to 
continue their educations. For instance, you may 
qualify to study for a graduate degree during off- 
duty hours, with the Air Force paying a substantial 
part of the tuition.
What kind of future do I have in the Air Force?
A bright one. As we move further into the Aero­
space Age, the Air Force is going to grow even 
more important. And you can grow with it!

Art and Engineering Linked' 
In Creation Of Bas Relief
Two Carnegie Tech professors, James P. Romualdi, professor of 
civil engineering, and Kent C. Bloomer, assistant professor of architec- j 
ture, combining art and engineering, have created a massive sculpture 
in bas relief that may open new approaches for architects, sculptors
and civil engineers.
The relief, which was two years 
in the making, was commissioned 
by the Rodef Shalom Temple to dec­
orate more than 600 square feet 
above an entrance way.
The relief is located between a 
domed structure and a long, low 
addition to neo - classic pro­
portions. It fronts on nearly an 
acre of lawn and is near a busy 
intersection.
Bloomer said he considered the 
dome, the wall, the lawn, the street 
and even the speed of passing traf­
fic in arriving at his ultimate de­
sign.
Romualdi used his newly de­
veloped concrete in the work. The 
concrete eliminated the need for 
conventional reinforcing bars. 
Aided by a grant from the National 
Science Foundation, Romualdi had 
earlier discovered that closely - 
spaced short lengths of thin wire, 
mixed with concrete, made the 
material highly resistant to crack­
ing, corrosion, and other flaws.
The wires, which are mixed 
directly with the concrete are only 
six thousandths of an inch in
diameter and half an inch long>v 
The resulting material can be 
poured in the same manner as a 
conventional cement.
A prime advantage of the mate­
rial, according to Dr. Romualdi, 
is that it can be cast into almost 
any shape desired in sections as 
thin as half an inch. One of the 
potential commercial uses of this 
material, Dr. Romualdi says, is the 
construction of thin exterior waUl 
panels to provide strong light - 
weight paneling attached to steel 
framework.
In preparing their sculpture, 
Romualdi and Bloomer decided 
to carve the entire volume out of 
styrofoam. The styrofoam was cut 
into 35 panels and each panel was 
encased in a thin layer of con­
crete.
The surface was then coateOfll 
with a shell of epoxy cement with 
a quartz and silicon aggregate. 
The shell itself was stiffened and 
reinforced by over 600 feet of 
half inch by three inch concrete 
ribs cast into the styrofoam.

Prexy’s Assistant Analyzes 
Attitudes, Values, Motives
continued from bF E
the faculty member himself. Fric­
tion of another sort is created on 
the campus because the studeht’s 
responsibility is perceived more 
narrowly by the faculty than by the 
student.
Intellectuals
To the faculty the primary rea­
son for your presence on campus 
is an intellectual one. You are 
here to learn, to study, to mas­
ter what the faculty teaches, to 
prepare yourself for a profess­
ion. Many of them would say that 
frthis is the only valid reason for 
your being here. The faculty is 
not so naive as to believe that 
you are here only for this pur­
pose — experience has taught 
them otherwise.
Yet whatever non-intellective 
reasons you may have for coming 
to college, the faculty member 
views as secondary and really of 
no concern to him.
P' Generally he is willing to let 
you do as you please above and 
beyond your academic work if you 
meet your classroom responsi­
bilities fully. He may even parti­
cipate with you in these activi­
ties. Yet he cannot in good con­
science permit you to substitute 
achievements outside the class­
room for performance in it. Re­
cognizing the personal values to 
you of fraternities, football, buggy 
races, Scotch-n-Soda, or the my­
riad of other activities you may 
be engaged in, he is understand­
ably reluctant to give these equal 
status with English, chemistry, 
painting or electrical engineering. 
Where accommodation is necess­
ary, he expects thenon-curricular 
to accommodate to the curricular 
rather than vice-versa.
' The faculty member’s view of 
what is of primary importance 
flows naturally from his concept 
of himself as a practicing pro­
fessional within the framework of 
an institution committed basically 
to intellectual concerns. Although 
he recognizes and accepts you as 
a person, his relationship to you is 
a professional one closer to the 
^relationship you have with your 
doctor than those you have with 
your father, brother or a close 
friend. He assumes that you are 
here to benefit from his profess­
ional competence just as he ex­
pects that you would go to a phy­
sician for medical help rather 
than to play chess.
I suspect that many students 
attend college for reasons that 
are much broader than this. One 
obvious difference is that for many 
of you college, both inside and out­
side the classroom, is your life, 
while for the faculty member, 
teaching you is only one aspect of 
his profession which in turn is only 
a part of his total human activity. 
In a sense the university recog­
nizes this difference by providing 
a multitude of opportunities which Lit believes have educational values 
that are outside of the formal aca­
demic program.
Still the primacy of the aca­
demic over the non-academic is 
unmistakable in the value system 
of the institution. The record turns 
up no one who being successful In 
the classroom was dropped be­
cause of his failure to perform 
outside of it and conversely a 
¦{iazzling record of extra-curricu- 
lar achievement has not stayed the 
academic execution of those who 
have failed in the classroom. Stu­
dents who have more personal pro­
blems to solve and more obstacles 
to overcome than achieving a pass­
ing grade in calculus or the His­
tory of Western Civ often find this 
viewpoint extremely parochial.
sRh personal achievement of 
f orking together, overcoming ob­
stacles, winning the respect and 
admiration of one’s fellows that 
often accompanies preparation for 
Homecoming or readying a buggy
for Spring C arnival looms so much 
larger than passing a quiz in chem­
istry to young people striving for 
a sense of identity and achieve­
ment that faculty members with 
the temerity to schedule exams in 
the midst of these activities are 
damned to the echo.
Criteria for Judgement
If one were able to judge inci­
dents such as this in isolation and 
to use some absolute standard of 
values, the students would probably 
be judged right and the faculty 
member wrong. If he is wrong, does 
it follow that he is perverse, sad­
istic, callous? Does it mean he is 
out to *get* students or that he gets 
his kicks from spoiling their plea­
sures? One must be careful not to 
assume that every wrong is a pur­
poseful and personal blow. If a 
faculty member considered every 
wrong answer on a quiz as a per­
sonal affront, you would consider 
him some kind of nut. Why then 
must errors in judgment on his 
part spring only from dark mo­
tives?
A third conflict springs from the 
way in which a university functions 
in society and the eagerness of stu­
dents to participate more actively 
in the momentous problems of our 
time or even in the narrower pro­
fessional activities which are their 
primary personal interest. This 
difference is most vividly mani­
fested in the extensive involve­
ment of students in the civil rights 
movement and particularly in the 
most activistic aspects of that 
movement — marches, sit-ins, 
picketing and the like. Although 
there are a large number of fa­
culty members equally active and 
often in the same ways, the institu­
tional participation of universities, 
per se, if it exists at all, is on a 
much different level.
Paul Denise, a very perceptive 
student of campus life, has made 
what I think is an extremely cogent 
observation on why this is so when 
he characterized the university in 
this way:
"The university is an institution 
of enormous and explosivedynam- 
isim in our culture which paradox­
ically projects upon the world an 
image of calm and order.Claiming 
an unlimited and radical right to 
examine and question just about 
anything, it is nevertheless prece- 
durally conservative to the n’th 
degree. Brewing revolutions it ex­
udes a curious decorum. In a sense 
the university is the monestary be­
come modern — all excitement is 
allowed there, all inquiry, pro­
vided it is confined within the dis­
cipline of the university’s intellec­
tual order; the world and its chaotic 
problems may be the object of dis­
passionate study but never of 
passionate action. By this re­
straint, in this tentativeness, 
through this subtle balancing act, 
the university marks the gap be­
tween itself and society and seeks 
also to maintain its objectivity and 
autonomy.*
The student, however, has 
different motives — he is anxious 
to taste life, to become involved, to 
participate in the world. For years 
he has seen things only through 
books, through manufactured acti­
vities — he is impatient with the 
theoretical and, according to Den­
ise, skeptical of what people say 
is so — he has to find out for 
himself and he feels the university 
should be in it with him.
Even at the professional level, 
this gap between the interests of 
the university and those of the 
students is apparent. Last year, 
I had occasion to talk at length 
with a group of students who were 
extremely active in the campus 
radio station. They had, in fact, 
substituted their activities at the 
station for their classroom re­
sponsibilities and at least part of 
the reason for doing so was be­
cause they found work at the sta­
tion real and exciting as contrast­
ed with the highly theoretical at­
mosphere of the classroom.
Even the more patient begin to 
wonder if they will ever get to the 
point of doing something useful and 
constructive. Is engineering any­
thing more than calculus, physics, 
chemistry, thermodynamics, 
mechanics and heat transfer? Is 
acting not something more than 
learning to speak, to project, to 
move? When, they may well ask, do 
we get a peek at the real world?
Intellectual vs. Physical
But the university never intended 
to show them the real world in the 
sense they are looking for it. Its 
concern for problems is an in­
tellectual concern — it is curious 
to know their dimension, their 
cause, their constituent parts, 
their implications and to construct 
rational solutions based on these 
investigations. It is concerned with 
intellectual action not physical ac­
tion.
In its educational function its in­
terests are similar. Here it is con­
cerned in preparing people to solve 
problems not in the actual solu­
tions themselves — in giving them 
tools, in disciplining their approach 
to a problem, in providing the base 
from which one can bvjild the kind 
of knowledge and skill they will 
need later.
As Denise put it, the university 
brews revolutions but does not 
participate in them, it also pre­
pares revolutionaries but does not 
lead them.
During the past 20 minutes or 
so, I have tried to depict for you 
three broad areas of conflict that 
exist on the university campus be­
cause of the significant difference 
between expectation and reality. 
The first arising out of the stu­
dents’ expectation that the pri­
mary responsibility of the faculty 
is to teach them while the faculty 
perceives its function to be much 
broader and refuses to accept the 
hierarchy of responsibilities the 
student wishes to impose upon 
them.
The second stemming from the 
faculty's expectation that your cen­
tral responsibility is academic, 
and that all conflicts of interest 
should be resolved in favor of the 
classroom, while the student sees 
his college experiences to me 
much broader and refuses to ac­
cept the hierarchy of values the 
university seeks to impose on him. 
And finally the students* drive for 
activism, for participation and for 
real experience pitted against the 
university’s concern for theory, 
discipline, restraint and intellec­
tual involvement only.
These conflicts will exhibit 
themselves in a variety of ways. 
You will have some teachers whose 
abilities in the classroom are not 
calculated to dazzle you. There 
will be some who are difficult to 
find and when found appear pre­
occupied with other concerns and 
apparently disinterested in your 
problem. There will betimes when 
teachers schedule quizzes or as­
sign papers in the midst of activi­
ties surrounding homecoming or 
Spring Carnival.
There will be a few teachers who 
will openly disparage out-of-class 
activities such as fraternities, ath­
letics, and buggy races. On such 
occasions you and your colleagues 
seethe with righteous indignation 
and send delegations to deans and 
to the president, who very likely 
will sympathize with your predic­
ament, understand your anger, but 
do nothing much about it.
In presenting the faculty anda^- 
ministration in these terms, I do 
not wish to suggest that these views 
are shared by all of them or that 
those who do hold them express 
them with equal virulence. The 
proper role of the faculty member 
in the university is disputed with­
in the fraternity itself. You shall 
have many professors here who 
think of themselves primarily, if 
not exclusively, as teachers. There 
are also many who will understand 
and accept your evaluation of the
importance of non-intellective ex­
periences at college. Yet, at a uni­
versity as contrasted with a col­
lege, those who perceive their re­
sponsibilities somewhat as I have 
¡described them hold the upper hand 
and these views will be reflected 
in the total operation of the insti­
tution.
Conflict Not Reconcilable
In its purest form, I believe, the 
conflict is irreconcilable. It is a 
part of the conflict between genera­
tions that may very well be essen­
tial to the ultimate maturity of the 
emerging generation and the con­
tinued progress of those in power. 
It could very well be another mani­
festation of the Hegelian cycle of 
thesis, antithesis and synthesis. 
Our concern should not be so much 
to resolve the conflict as to re­
move from it the bitterness and the 
personalization that are spawned
out of the hear of anger and frus­
tration.
We might well turn out thoughts 
and energy to a consideration of 
what might be done to meet the 
needs and desires of students with­
in the context of facultys’ view of 
the university and their responsi­
bilities in it. There is, as they say, 
more than one way to skin a cat 
and what we need is some creative 
imagination on both sides and to 
this constructive task I would com­
mend your energies.
While we struggle with the pro­
blem, I do not expect you to do- 
cilly accept what you find, unless, 
of course, it appeals to you. But 
the great lesson to be learned 
from conflict is not tolerance of 
the other fellow’s point of view, 
but an understanding of his mo­
tives. One of the tragedies of in- 
trapersonal relationships and of 
relationships between groups and 
nations is the eagerness to define 
all conflicts in terms of good and 
evil, objectivity and prejudice, 
honesty and duplicity, black and 
white. Perhaps it is easier to fight 
holy wars than ordinary ones or 
perhaps in our conviction about the 
rightness of our cause we assume 
that no reasonable and honorable 
person could arrive at a different 
conclusion.
Yet men are products of their 
time, their experience, their en­
vironment and their interests all 
of which structure the premises 
and the first principles from which 
they construct their values. This 
would be an excellent time for you 
and us to accept the fact that people 
can disagree honestly and to struc­
ture our attitudes on the assump­
tion that they do. This may not 
lessen the differences that exist, 
but it may permit us to seek solu­
tions rather than victories.
This presentation turned out to 
be more sober and serious than I 
originally intended. Perhaps it is 
unfair and inappropriate to start 
you on a great adventure by warn­
ing you of the obstacles rather 
than holding up to you the rewards. 
I am sure that your experience 
here will not be nearly so grim as 
my remarks suggest, and I sin­
cerely hope that despite the in­
evitable ups and downs, it will be 
on the whole a happy and satisfy­
ing four years for each of you.

Men’s Intramurals Offer
Full Sports Schedule
The Intramural athletics program will soon be off to another season of competitive sports for all interest­
ed male students.
Major sports scheduled for this year are: touch football, soccer, volleyball, bowling, basketball, and soft­
ball. In addition, there will be 17 other minor and intermediate sports from which to choose.
Any group (classes, floors, commuters, etc.) may enter a team in the competition by filling out the official 
roster and returning it, along with $2.50, to the Intramural Office.
There is a final date of appli­
cation for each sport.
The first rosters due, and their 
respective due dates are: co-rec 
volleyball and October 12; soccer,
October 19. Touch football and ten­
nis rosters were due yesterday.
It should be noted that the due 
dates are Tuesdays, a change from 
last year.
Lists of activities and their due 
dates, official roster sheets, 
copies of the Carnegie Tech In­
tramural Constitution, along with 
any additional information may be 
obtained from the intramural of­
fice in the Gym (room 104).
Each team must choose a mana­
ger, who, in turn, must attend 
several meetings scheduled d ur- 
ing the duration of the sport. These 
meetings will be held at 12;30p.m. 
in the Black Cat Lounge, Gym, 
on the Tuesdays that the rosters 
are due for the various sports.
Because of a change in last 
year's point system, two points 
will be given to each team head­
ing the league in a major sport.
One point will be given to the 
league winners in an intermediate 
sport. These points will count 
toward the winning of the All 
Sports Trophy.
Officials to referee the various 
contests are much in need. Each 
official will receive $1.25 per 
game. Anyone interested should 
contact James Lipman, president 
of the Officials' Club, or with 
Eugene Boyer, the intramural 
director.

IM Lights Not Erected; 
Problem Not Put Aside
by Fred Stone 
President, IM Board
Many students, on their first day back at Carnegie Tech, expected to 
find a newly installed lighting system on the IM field.
Anticipation of IM field lights had been strengthened last spring by 
the Administration's suggestion that work should be done on it this 
summer.
Late last May, George K. Brown, 
dean of student affairs, Frank M. 
Cratsley, athletic director and 
basketball coach, Eugene L. Boyer, 
assistant professor, physical edu­
cation, and I met with a lighting 
engineer on the intramural field. 
We explained to the lighting expert 
just what lighting facilities were 
needed and where.
Everyone left the meeting with 
renewed hope that lights would be 
installed this ummer and that this 
fall IM football and soccer games 
would no longer finish in darkness.
However, no one concerned 
dreamed that the project would cost 
about $30,000 which was the esti­
mate presented to the administra­
tion in June. This is the reason why 
the lights are not installed now.
The use of wooden poles instead 
of steel poles was considered, but 
the cost would still be greater than 
$25,000.
The school has not forgotten 
about the lighting problem, but 
will try to work out a solution.
It is hoped that they will not 
drop the matter. Dean Brown has 
no intention of doing this. He 
feels that the lights should be pur­
chased even at this great expense. 
In spite of the excessive cost 
Dean Brown feels that construc­
tion should begin on the lights so 
that they could be ready for next 
spring's softball games.
