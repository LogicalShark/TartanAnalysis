Senate elections stand despite mix-up
By 85, HENDERSON
Tartan Contributing Editor
The results of last week’s Sen­
te election, which was a retake 
of the fall election, will stand.
“I haven’t gotten any written 
complaints,” said Election Board 
Chair Mike Reed. Furthermore, 
no challenges were issued during 
the three-day challenge period 
following the elections. Although 
the results are official, several 
problems including invalid peti­
tions and low voter turnout 
threatened to invalidate the pro­
cess once again.
Last Tuesday’s and 
Wednesday’s elections ran into 
Problems early in the validation 
process. “Thursday before the 
élections, at about midnight, we
finished validating the petitions,” 
said Reed. “Some people were 
notified that night, and about 80 
percent [of all people who had 
turned in petitions] had been no­
tified by Friday.” The notifica­
tions were done by phone.
Valid petitions require 25 valid 
signatures. A valid signature is 
the signature of any student 
within the college of the potential 
candidate who is taking at least
19 units and has paid the Activi­
ties Fee. A valid petition means 
that a candidate will appear on 
the ballot for his or her college. A 
valid petition is not necessary for 
running a write-in campaign.
Four of the petitions which were 
inyalidated were those of fresh­
man Adam Barksdale, sophomore 
Terrell Dean, junior Thomas
“/ am angry that A Phi 0 did not 
make an effort to let people know 
that they had invalidated petitions. ”

Strong, Jr., and junior Stephen 
Reinhard. These petitions were 
not taken to the Registrar’s Office 
until Friday morning. “Some 
names were not on our list from 
the registrar,” said Reed, “so on 
Friday morning we went to the 
Registrar to get the official aye or 
nay.” Because of the Friday 
morning research, both Dean and 
Strong were included on the bal­
lot, said Reed.
Junior Jay Laefer’s petition was 
also invalidated. Laefer was in 
MCS last semester when he won a 
seat in the fall election. He 
resubmitted his petition for the 
spring election, but according to 
the Registrar’s list, Laefer was 
officially a School of Computer 
Science student. He requested to

bust CMU studentsin drug stingpolice
By RICHARD SONG
fartan Staffwriter
i After an intricate sting opera­
tion, Pittsburgh Police have ar­
rested four CMU students on drug 
possession charges. The students 
were arrested at their house in 
Shadyside on Thursday evening, 
January 24. Two other occupants 
of the house, who were not home 
at the time of the arrest, turned
themselves in the following day.
The operation began in Colo­
rado when a Denver postal worker 
notified police that a suspicious 
package had been posted for 
mailing to Pittsburgh. Authori­
ties found one pound of hallucino­
genic mushrooms in the package 
and subsequently asked Pitts­
burgh police to investigate its in­
tended destination.
After obtaining a search war­
rant, a Pittsburgh police officer, 
dressed as a UPS delivery person, 
delivered the package to the 
Shadyside address. The intended 
recipient, his girlfriend, and an­
other man were home at the time. 
When the package was opened, a 
planted “beeper” signalled and 10 
Pittsburgh police officers dressed 
in bullet-proof vests and armed 
with a battering ram entered the 
five-bedroom house. During the
ensuing search, the fourth stu­
dent returned home and was sub­
sequently placed under arrest.
The students were taken to the 
North Hills station at 6:30 pm; 
they were not processed until 2 
am. The three men were charged 
with four counts of drug violation 
and one count of“tampering with 
records or identification.” The 
package recipient also received 
one count of “criminal conspiracy
to manufacture marijuana.” The 
woman, who is not a resident of 
the house, was charged with two 
drug violations, as a pipe and a 
small amount of marijuana were 
found in her purse. All four stu­
dents spent the night in deten­
tion cells and were released on 
bail the following day. The Court 
Magistrate set bail at $5000 for 
each of the men, and $1000 for 
the woman. At 2:30 pm, the girl­
friend of one of the men used a 
bondsman to release three of the 
students. The other man had bail 
paid by one of his fraternity 
brothers. If bail had not been met, 
the students were scheduled to be 
transferred to Pittsburgh County 
Jail at 4 pm.
Two additional occupants ofthe 
house returned home later on the 
evening of the arrest. They con-

charges

Peace activist Vincent Eirene has been 
found not guilty of aggravated assault 
regarding an incident which occurred 
last May, when he was alleged to have 
bitten Pittsburgh police o 
fficer Leo Campbell. Eirene, known to 
many at CMU for his opposition to 
Carnegie Mellon’s Defense Department 
research liaisons, faced a possible five to
10 years in jail and a maximum fine of 
$25,000.
At the time of the alleged incident, 
May 4, 1990, Eirene was in court for 
charges of defiant trespassing and ob­
structing the administration of justice 
by picketing on the grounds of CMU’s 
Software Engineering Institute. Eirene 
and several others had just unfurled a 
large banner in the lobby of the court­
house that read “Disarm Carnegie Mel­
lon,” when he was arrested by Campbell 
and several other officers. Eirene was 
alleged to have bitten Campbell while 
he was being handcuffed.
In the first day of the three-day trial, 
Common Pleas Court Judge Sheryl Allen 
Craig reduced the charge to simple as­
sault for lack of probable cause for ar­
rest, according to Tip-staff Monica 
Satterwhite.
The penalty for simple assault is one 
to two years in jail, and a maximum fine 
of $5,000. Satterwhite said officer

Starting next fall, the College 
of Humanities and Social Sciences 
will offer the option of a major or 
minor in the field of political sci­
ence.
Poly sci will be offered by the 
Department of Social and Deci­
sion Sciences, and “will draw on 
courses offered by SDS and by 
other departments on campus,” 
according to a press release by 
H&SS.
According to Mark Kamlet, SDS 
department head, “It represents
a real milestone for the college

Students who enter the poli sci 
track will begin with the stan­
dard H&SS core. Particular 
courses relevant to the major in­
clude World History and Prin-
ciples of Economics. The poly sci 
major will build on this core with

Campbell testified that Eirene “gnawed 
on him like a beaver.”
Additionally, two other officers testi­
fied to having seen blood on Campbell 
after the alleged attack. Examination of 
Campbell’s hand, however, revealed 
what Satterwhite described as “no more 
than a pin prick,” and Campbell himself 
acknowledged that he had neither suf­
fered pain nor required medical assis­
tance as the result ofthe alleged assault.
The 12-member jury found Eirene not
guilty in the third day of proceedings and 
testimony, after less than an hour of 
deliberation.
Testifying as character witnesses for 
Eirene were fellow activist Father Jack 
O’Malley, anti-nuclear activist Molly 
Rush, and Father Phillip Barigan, known 
for burning draft records during the 
Vietnam War. Eirene also had three 
material witnesses, including Jeff Becker 
of the Herald Dispatch.
In addition to the witnesses, a large

contingent of supporters turned out for 
the trial, including friends, fellow activ­
ists, and students from CMU and Pitt, 
said Eirene. “He [Eirene] had a lot of 
people here,” said Satterwhite, pointing 
out that there were “quite a few” CMU 
students among them.
“I think all the people there should get 
three credits for an independent study at 
Carnegie Mellon University, Pitt, and 
the Art Institute of Pittsburgh,” joked

Frustration prevails for CMU students 
this time of year as they are forced to 
wait several days or weeks if they want 
their transcripts for $2 from the 
registrar’s office.
As of this spring, however, a new 
electronic program, designed by the 
Administrative Systems division of the 
University Computing Center, will coor­
dinate grade information to form new 
and more accessible transcripts.
Accordingto Debra James, soordinator 
for services, the reason for the wait is 
partially due to the fact that grades and 
enrollment all must be dealt with in 
January.
Also, said Lola Porpora, the adminis­
trative assistant for academic records, 
“This is the heaviest time because of 
graduate school deadlines and [job] in­
terviews. This year we have surpassed 
what we did last year with transcripts.”
“Furthermore, there have been over 
two thousand individual transcript re­
quests since the beginning of the year,” 
said Carnegie Mellon transcriptionist 
Helen Taylor. While the requests could 
be “multiple [several transcripts for one 
person], each
one has to be individually addressed and 
labeled, mostly by hand,” she said.
Under the present system, students 
pay anywhere between $5 and $20 to get

THIS JUST IN...
Bush gives wartime State of the Union Address
. WASHINGTON (DJ) — President Bush, claim­
ing that the Iraq’s ability to wage war is being 
destroyed, said that the U.S. stands “at a defining 
hour” as it seeks to repel Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait.
“For two centuries, we’ve done the hard work of 
, freedomBush said in a State of the Union Address 
, before a joint session of Congress. “And tonight, we 
lead the world in facing down a threat to decency 
and humanity.”
Bush said that “Iraq’s capacity to sustain war is 
being destroyed.”
But he added that the U.S. doesn’t intend to “seek 
the destruction of Iraq, its culture, or its people... 
We seek a Persian Gulf where conflict is no longer 
the rule, where the strong are neither tempted nor 
able to intimidate”
On the situation in the Baltics, Bush said that 
“We have been deeply concerned by the violence in 
the Baltics, and we have communicated that con­
cern to the Soviet leadership.
“In our recent discussions with the Soviet lead­
ership, we have been given representations which, 
if fulfilled, would result in the withdrawal of some 
Soviet forces, a reopening of dialogue with the 
(Baltic) republics, and a move away from violence,” 
Bush said.
On the economy, Bush said that while he isn’t 
“unrealistic,” there are reasons to be optimistic
about our economy.”
He said that inflation has remained in check and 
most industries have been saved from making big 
production cuts because inventories are trim.
A senior Administration official confirmed that 
no major spending programs are planned for the 
specific purpose of stimulating growth. “There’s no 
heavy spending program that some folks have talked 
about,” the official said. “There’s no shock treatment 
because the president feels that the best way to deal 
(with the economic slump) is over the long-term.” 
Bush said that economic growth has been “tem­
porarily interrupted. But our economy is still over 
twice as large as our closest competitor. “We will get 
this recession behind us, and return to growth 
soon,” Bush said.
The senior administration official said Bush’s 
legislative agenda is based on the premise that the 
U.S. recession will be over “soon,” possibly before 
the fiscal 1992 budget plan goes into effect next 
Autumn.
Bush renewed his call for controls on government 
spending, and said his budget plan for fiscal 1992 
will “hold the growth in spending to less than the 
rate of inflation.”
He said spending limits achieved under last year’s 
five-year $500 billion deficit reduction plan will be 
enforced.
Bush said his budget, to be outlined Feb. 4, also 
includes tax-free family savings accounts; penalty- 
free withdrawals from Individual Retirement Ac­
counts for first-time home-buyers; and, to increase 
jobs and growth, a reduced tax for long-term capital 
gains.
A senior administration official said the cut in the 
capital gains tax would reduce the levy to 19.6 
percent from the current level of 28 percent. It also 
includes a 30 percent exclusion, the official said. 
The proposal is essentially the same as the one 
included in, but eventually chopped from, last year’s 
budget.
“I know there are differences among us about the 
impact and the effects of a capital gains incentive,” 
Bush said.
“So tonight, I am asking the congressional leaders 
and the Federal Reserve to cooperate with us in a 
study—led by Chairman Alan Greenspan—to sort 
out our technical differences so that we can avoid a 
return to unproductive partisan bickering.”
Bush said plans will be revealed soon for a new 
national highway system.
A senior official said the long-awaited infra­
structure policy will be introduced on Capitol Hill 
“in the next week or so.”
Bush promised a National Energy Strategy that 
calls for energy conservation and “efficiency, in­
creased development and greater use of alternative 
fuels.”
On the current “credit crunch” in which financial 
institutions have reportedly been refusing loans to 
credit- worthy customers, thereby deepening the 
recession, Bush said, “I do think there has been,too 
much pessimism. Sound banks should be mal 
more sound loans, now—and interest rates should 
be lower, now.”
Bush also repeated his call for a successful con­
clusion to the current Uruguay Round of gl0Jbal 
trade talks being carried out under the auspices of 
the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT).
Finally, Bush called for a radical downsizing 0f 
the space-based anti-missile defense program 
known during the Reagan Administration as 
Wars, or the Strategic Defense Initiative fSDij'1 
Referring to the success of Patriot missiles in 
defending civilians against attack by Iraqi SCUD 
missiles, Bush said, “we can defend against ballj 
tic missile attacks aimed at innocent civilians.” 
“Looking forward, I have directed that the SDI 
program be refocused on providing protection from 
limited ballistic missile strikes — whatever their 
source. Let us pursue an SDI program that can-ileal 
with any future threat to the U.S., to our forces 
overseas, and to our friends and allies,” Bush s'aidj
Five hundred Iraqi 
soldiers captured
RIYADH (DJ) — The number of Iraqi soldiers killed and 
captured in the battle of Khafji indicates that Iraq President 
Saddam Hussein sacrificed at least one full battalion in a short­
lived campaign that he allegedly planned himself, allied officers 
' said.
While allied officials gave varying figures for the 36-hour fight 
in the port city just below the Kuwait border, they portrayed it as 
; a decisive victory in the first major ground clash of the two-week- 
. old war.
A British officer called the Khafji battle “a clear disaster” for 
Iraq, with “well over 300” killed and many more wounded. But the 
1 British later withdrew that estimate, saying the correct number 
of slain Iraqis was 30—the same number reported by the Saudis.
U.S. officers said more than 500 prisoners were in Saudi hands 
and the number could increase.
Those figures alone were the equivalent of one battalion of Iraqi 
mechanized infantry, according to a table of military organization 
published by the London-based International Institute for Stra­
tegic Studies.
Col. Ahmed Al-Robayan, chief spokesman for the Joint Forces 
command, said the Iraqi force actually was “brigade-minus” in 
size, meaning something less than 4,000 troops. He said 30 Iraqis 
were killed, 33 wounded and 400 captured, but called those 
figures “preliminary.”
He also said the Saudi and Qatari troops who retook Khafji 
yesterday had seized “enough equipment to equip an entire 
armored battalion and an infantry battalion.”
Al-Robayan said units of the Saudi national guard, army and 
marines together with Qatari troops retook the town with the 
support of U.S. helicopters and artillery. He gave Saudi casual­
ties as 15 killed, 32 wounded and four missing, while Iraqi fire 
also knocked out three tanks, one multiple rocket launcher and 
two ambulances the colonel described as “clearly marked.”
Defense budget proposed for 1992
WASHINGTON (AP) — Presi­
dent Bush is proposing a defense 
budget of $295 billion for fiscal
1992 that includes $4.6 billion for 
the Strategic Defense Initiative 
and money for four B-2 stealth 
bombers, congressional sources 
said.
The defense budget, a decrease 
of about $4 billion from last year’s 
amount, is the first Gulf war 
budget that also reflects a down­
turn in defense spending.
The request for SDI would, if
approved, be $1.7 billion more 
than the $2.9 billion Congress 
and the administration agreed to 
last year.
Among the major terminations 
in the president’s proposal, ac­
cording to sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, are the 
Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the 
Trident submarine and the Air 
Force’s Advanced Tactical Air­
craft.
Last year’s budget amounted to 
$.9 billion in real spending
and $285.6 billion in the author­
ity given to the Defense Depart­
ment for the budget.
Consistent with the levels set 
by the Bush administration and 
the Congress in the budget agree­
ment reached late last year, real 
spending in the new budget is 
$295.2 billion while the authority 
totals $290.8 billion.
The new budget includes $550 
million in fiscal 1992 for the 
Midgetman nuclear missile and 
$458 million in research and de-
velopment money for the MX 
nuclear missile.
The administration has no.pro- 
curement money in the budget for 
the MX missile.
Last year’s budget significantly 
cut the administration’s request 
of $2.2 billion for placing MX;mis- 
siles on railroad cars and $202 
million for development of the 
Midgetman nuclear missile;
Instead, the budget included 
strategic pot of $680 million'for 
the two missile systems.
Consumer confidence drops to ten year low
NEW YORK (D J) — Consumer 
confidence, which dropped dra­
matically in October, tumbled in 
January to its lowest level in 10 
years, The Conference Board re­
ports.
The Board’s Consumer Confi­
dence Index (1985-100) fell to 54.0 
in January, from the 61.3 recorded 
in December. The latest reading 
is only slightly above that recorded 
during the bottom of the 1980 
recession.
Survey results recorded in the 
first half of January were down 
sharply.
Following United States mili­
tary action on Jan. 16, however,
Americans became somewhat 
more optimistic in their expecta­
tions for the immediate future.
The monthly survey, covering 
five thousand households 
throughout the United States, is 
conducted for the Board by Na­
tional Family Opinion Inc. of To­
ledo, Ohio.
“Last month’s drop in confidence 
probably can be attributed almost 
entirely to the crisis in Iraq,” says 
Fabian Linden, executive director 
of The Conference Board’s Con­
sumer Research Center. “Survey 
results recorded in the first half 
of January were down sharply as 
last-minute peace negotiations
failed. But after military action 
began, consumer confidence 
picked up slightly, presumably 
because early indications sug­
gested a short war. A reasonably 
quick victory might well provide 
the psychological thrust to in­
vigorate the economy.”
Well over one-third of respon­
dents now consider business 
conditions to be “bad,” according 
to the Conference Board survey. 
There is also continuing concern 
about the U.S. employment situ­
ation. Now one-third of all re­
spondents complain that jobs are 
“hard to get,” up slightly from 
December. Americans are also
slightly more concerned than m 
December about job availability 
over the next six months.
Only 19 percent of survey, re­
spondents expect their earnings 
to rise duringthe next six months, 
a drop of more than three per­
centage points since December;
Buyingplans continue to be soft. 
Only 5.6 percent of consun^rs 
plan to buy a car during the,n$# 
six months, compared with, 6.2 
percent in December.
Intentions to purchase a home 
are also marginally lower. Plans 
to purchase major appliances are 
virtually the same, the Conference 
Board says.
Democrats respond to 
Bush’s State of the Union
WASHINGTON (D J) — Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell (D-Maine) said Democrats support 
the war against Iraq, but accused President Bush of 
ignoring injustice elsewhere in the world as well as 
needs at home.
“We cannot oppose repression in one place and 
overlook it in another,” Mitchell said in remarks 
prepared for delivery on all four major television 
networks as the Democratic response to Bush’s 
! State of the Union address.
“Students massacred in China, priests murdered 
in Central America, demonstrators gunned down 
in Lithuania — these acts of violence are as wrong 
as Iraqi solders killing civilians,” he said.
And while Bush “says he seeks a new world 
order,” Mitchell said, “we also have a crisis here at 
ihome.”
“We ask him to join us in putting our own house 
in order,” he said, with the first priority a program 
!for economic growth.
Mitchell called on the president to develop a 
national energy policy to reduce the nation’s reliance 
on imported oil, much of which is from the Persian 
Gulf region.
The nation’s health care system is also in need of 
overhaul, he said, “and we don’t have any policy on 
what will be the crisis of this decade: long-term care 
for the elderly.”
Mitchell promised congressional support for the

troops in the Middle East, even though he and other 
Democrats would have preferred to continue the 
use of sanctions instead of launching a military 
attack.
“Whether force should be used immediately, or 
only as a last resort if other means failed.... No one 
will ever know if that other course would have 
worked,” he said.
“Now that war has begun, we’ll work to see that 
it’s swift and decisive, with the least possible loss of 
life,” he said.
Mitchell’s Republican counterpart, Senate Mi­
nority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, praised Bush 
last night for striking the right tone in his address.
“President Bush had his priorities right tonight. 
This was no time for an ordinary state of the union, 
it was really time for a state of unity message,” he 
said. “We’ll have plenty of time to roll up our sleeves 
and tackle the serious domestic agenda he out­
lined.”
Mitchell’s criticism was echoed by other Demo­
crats, who slammed Bush for payingmore attention 
to other nations than his own.
“The president has locked himself in his war 
room, leaving our domestic needs banging at the 
door,” said Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), chairman 
of the House Committee on Government Opera­
tions.
“There is ample money to fight foreign wars or to 
bail out the savings and loans, but there are only 
scarce resources to restore our cities and our people’s 
hopes,” he said.
“We are losing the fight to give our troops op­
portunities when they come home from the war,” he 
said.

SDS adds political science major to curriculum
SDS from page 1[^‘Together these requirements 
‘provide an outstanding back­
ground in social science methods 
and theory, as well as solid 
grounding in the study of politics,” 
stated the press release.
After completing the core re­
quirements, political science ma­
jors must take five upper-level 
electives in one of three specific 
-clusters—American Politics, In­
ternational Affairs, and Political 
¿Theory and Methodology.
The structure of courses taken 
ivill be decided by students and 
•academic advisors; however, they 
Hvill usually involve three courses
“It’s a major with a lot of flexibilityand it can point you

in one cluster and one from each of 
the others.
According to the press release, 
“Students may also complement 
their formal coursework with in­
ternship experiences such as the 
Washington S emester Program.... 
Students can also spend a semes­
ter or year abroad at the CMU
campus in Tours, France or at a 
wide range of other overseas 
programs with which Carnegie 
Mellon is affiliated.”
“The major is also compatible 
with pursuit of the H&SS/SUPA 
3/1/1 program,” the release 
points out, “ where in five years 
a student can get a B. S. in Politi­
cal Science and an M.S. in Public 
Management and Policy.”
“It’s a major with a lot of flex­
ibility, and it can point you in a lot 
of directions,” said Kamlet.
Karen Litzinger, the associate 
director of the career center, said, 
“There are many things you can 
do with it — the obvious govern-
ment options, as well as many 
jobs in other areas, such as law 
and law-related jobs.”
Another field supported by a 
degree in political science is jour­
nalism, and students and profes­
sionals planning for master’s de­
grees in business, public policy, 
and public administration will 
find the program beneficial as 
well.
It is “also appropriate for a 
wide variety of careers in... trade 
associations, lobbying groups, 
international organizations, 
business, and teaching,” accord­
ing to the press release.
“A recent analysis of teaching
and research careers at universi­
ties and colleges points to a strong

By ALISON GREEN
'Tartan Magazine Editor
WASHINGTON, D.C. — On January 
"27, the day after the peace march in 
Washington D.C., representatives from 
national and collegiate anti-war groups 
all over the country attended a meeting 
of the National Student and Youth Cam­
paign for Peace in the Middle East.
The meeting was held at Sidwell 
Friends School, a few blocks away from 
the University of D.C. campus. Junior 
H&SS student Aaron Young of CMU and 
Jill'Castek of Pitt represented Pittsburgh 
Students for Peace at the meeting.
Although it wasn’t the first meeting of 
its kind, it was an opportunity for mem­
bers of the groups to touch base with 
each.other before February 21, the anni­
versary of the death of Malcolm X.
Among the speakers at the meeting 
We Sana Odeh of the group Palestin- 
1 laii'Academic Freedom and Aurial Denee 
ofihe Paris-based group Movement Zero.
“Working together, we can move for­
ward,” Denee said in a general intro 
duction.
Representatives from the United States 
Student Association, the Young Social- 
ists/Workers League, the Student Envi­
ronmental Action Coalition, and the Fel­
lowship of Reconciliation were also 
present.
Collegiate groups and regional repre­
sentatives of national groups separated 
into six regions — New England, North­
east, Midatlantic, South, Midwest, and 
West — and discussed anti-war activi­
ties that had taken place on and around 
their campuses.
Other Midatlantic colleges such as In­
diana University of Pennsylvania and 
Edinboro University reported favorable 
response to recent activities, most of 
which were planned after the January 15 
war deadline.
Demands directed toward the U.S. 
government that would be upheld by the 
campuses as a collective were discussed
in the regional groups.
Although the regional meetings gener­
ally went well, the assembly that fol­
lowed was not as successful as hoped.
The demands were presented again, 
but there was very little agreement on 
their phrasing and objectives.
Mark Mateya of Edinboro University 
said that “reading the book ‘Out Now5 [a 
book about the peace movement during 
Vietnam] prepared me for some of the 
discord.”
Young said in retrospect that the 
meeting was “not necessarily a strict 
failing. I think we’re on the way to doing 
something.”
There were a number of demands pre­
sented to the groups for discussion. They 
included the following topics: stopping 
the war, bringing the troops home now, 
eliminating any legal or economic draft, 
fighting racism (at home and abroad), 
ending all occupation in the Middle East, 
and developing a sustainable energy 
policy.

Registrar’s Office revamps transcript production process
TRANSCRIPTS from page 1
their transcripts the same day to 
two days after they submit their 
requests. (The $20 fee applies to 
transcripts mailed from the 
registrar’s office by way of Fed- 
*eraT Express.) The fee is $2 for 
tliose who can wait longer.
The transcripts used now are 
made with labels which contain 
:each student’s course titles and 
grades. The labels are put on the 
official academic record by hand. 
During winter vacation, the 
Records staff in the registrar’s 
office work for a full week putting 
onthese labels.
• JlThe work is real tedious. For 
example, some people have 
bourses with large names and 
Ih’e'se require two labels,” said 
'Porpora.
“Our objective is to have it [the 
transcript] look as cosmetically 
'attractive as possible. We try re­

time because there will be no labels. We will be fully

ally hard to do this. Unfortu­
nately, some of our means are 
pretty archaic right now,” she 
said.
The new electronic system 
should change the gruelling tran­
script production process. How­
ever, developing such a compre­
hensive system has required that 
the personal data from every CMU 
student be researched and entered 
into the database.
“The number of [student] en­
tries started at 20,000 but that’s 
grown considerably,” said
Porpora. “The start date for the 
new program begins in the fall/ 
summer of 1986. If a student, 
undergraduate or graduate, was 
here during this date, regardless 
of when they started school here, 
we reconstructed their record to 
keep it all in one place,” she said.
“Three to five years ago, we [the 
Records Department] first started 
talking about developing a new 
[transcript] process,” said Regis­
trar Richard Rainsberger. How­
ever, he said, “we actually got 
started one year ago; in Septem­
ber 1989 we hired the first tempo­
rary [to begin research on stu­
dents’ personal data].”
Verifying the academic history 
of students has required much 
wearisome work.
“Much of the transcript infor­
mation is just typed on,” explained 
Porpora. “I have had to look at 
everyone who would be entered 
into the system and retrace their 
history to verify their names, so­
cial security numbers, courses ac­
cording to course numbers and 
titles, etc. Course verifications
alone required me to keep a his­
tory of course name changes,” she 
said.
“As well, we have to fulfill the 
individual needs of each college— 
because of the deans who want 
things done in a certain way. They 
have to decide the Dean’s list, 
expulsion, etc. the way they want 
it,” Porpora explained.
“Furthermore,” she said, “ROTC 
requires one QPA incorporating 
their classes and then those same 
students also need an academic 
QPA excluding those classes.”
The development of a new pro­
cess did not require only data 
entry and student academic in­
formation research. The tran­
scripts will also take on a new 
appearance.
“The new transcripts produced 
with the electronic program will 
be burgundy — they used to be 
blue like most schools in this area
— and the back of the transcript 
will explain school policies and 
the grading system; we want to 
represent our students the beat 
way we can,” Porpora said. j 
Significant progress on the ne^ 
system has taken place in recenlt 
months.
According to Porpora, “The ad­
ministrative lag time is already 
past and right now the project ijs 
being programmed to be a part cjf 
the Student Information Systemjs 
network.”
“The [system] needed a 90-day 
period to program for appearancfe 
and accuracy and we are in that 
90-day period now,” she contin­
ued. “It has been a difficult an$ 
long hard road to reach this point" 
“With the new system,” Porporfc 
continued, “the transcripts will 
take less time because there will 
be no labels. We will be fully elec­
tronic by spring,” she said. 11

Election results stand
SENATE, from page 1
Science student. He requested to 
"nge his academic advisor to 
JnljCS advisor but “wasn’t aware 
the change [to SCS] had gone 
through until it was too late to get 
¿ofe signatures. My petition did 
pot validate because it contained 
| mixture ofMCS and SCS signa­
tures.”
'.According to Undergraduate 
program Director of SCS Mark 
Stehlick, 78 students were 
'switched to SCS. Stehlick said it 
jprs part of the transfer of the 
•applied math/computer science 
^tudents from the Math Depart­
ment to SCS. “The students had 
¡to be swiched at some time, and 
ihis seemed like the optimum 
'time, he said. “I was not aware [of 
the election] until it happened. 
!\Ve tried to get everything but 
|there are always loose ends.”
' Laefer, who did challenge the 
flection last semester, chose not 
'to challenge this semester. “I 
¡hallenged the previous [election] 
because it was poorly run and 
unfairly run. This one, however, 
'was run fairly and I had no rea­
son to challenge.” Laefer also said 
that he was “notified immedi­
ately” that his petition had failed.
“It seemed really unfair to in­
validate Jay’s petition, but I didn’t 
have a choice. I had to enforce the
unfairness; we had to go by what 
the registrar’s list says in any 
event,” said Reed.
Several students thought that 
they were not properly notified of 
their petition status. Sophomore 
Matt Mueller was not on the bal­
lot but did manage to muster 10 
write-in votes to win a seat in 
industrial management. “I was 
notified the day before the elec­
tion that I was not on the ballot,” 
said Mueller. “They should have 
told the candidates a lot earlier.” 
According to Reed every effort 
was made to contact hopeful 
candidates, but he did not want to 
leave messages for people be­
cause, “I felt it was inappropriate 
to get this kind of news from 
roommates.” Current senator 
Amy Blake said, “I am angry that 
A Phi O did not make an effort to 
let people know that they had 
invalidated petitions. Terrell 
[Dean] has an answering machine 
and she had to call to find out.” 
However, Dean stated she “was 
out of town.”
Though there were many prob­
lems, some of the petitions were 
accepted without questions. MCS 
sophomore Hugh Moore said, “My 
petition was validated no prob­
lem. I had 35 signatures and I 
only needed 25.” Reed said he 
strongly suggests getting as many
signatures as possible to allow for 
potential invalid signatures. The 
petition contains 50 spaces for 
signatures.
This semester the elections 
drew six percent of the student 
body to the voting tables. Last 
semester the turnout was 4.6 per­
cent. “For Carnegie Mellon that is 
respectable,” said Reed. ’’For any­
where else that’s pathetic.” Reed 
blames the low turnout partly on 
the weather. “The election was 
better publicized than the last 
one but we didn’t have as good 
weather [this semester]. The 
second day we had to be inside 
Gray Matter.” Though apathy was 
not the factor that kept CFA 
sophomore Stephen Simon away 
from the polls, he did not vote 
“because I have little confidence 
in a group that is too incompetent 
to plan its own elections.”
“I am disappointed people are 
not taking the time to vote,” said 
Blake.“Off the top of my head I 
don’t know how we can increase 
the turnout. Maybe more adver­
tising. We [Senate] will have to 
discuss it,” he said.
As a new senator Moore has 
also placed increasing voter turn­
out on his agenda. “We need to 
combat student apathy with ad­
vertising. We need a big issue for 
campus to rally around,” he said.
Jury finds Eirene not guilty
EIRENE, from page 1
'students for future resistance and civil disobedi­
ence here in Pittsburgh because it gave them a 
;chance to see a trial, to see somebody who is a non- 
¡violent peacemaker be on trial to give them an 
¡idea of what they will face,” he said.
! In an unprecedented move, the judge allowed 
¡Eirene himself to speak to the jurors directly in 
¡the courtroom in his own defense. “The DA gave 
'us a lot of latitude to talk about the war, and non- 
'violence, and civil disobedience,” said Eirene. “In 
¡other situations the DAs would object to all of 
¡that, any type of political or philosophical or
religious beliefs, and restrict us to talking about 
the facts of the case.”
Prior to the trial, Eirene drew broad media 
attention as actor Martin Sheen joined him to 
petition Sheriff Coon’s office to drop the charges. 
The effort proved misguided, however, as it was 
not within the authority of the sheriffs office to 
affect charges that were levied by a police officer.
Despite the not guilty ruling, Eirene has declined 
his right to sue either Campbell or any of the other 
officers involved, citing that it would be a viola­
tion of his religious principles. “That would be not 
turning the other cheek,” said Eirene.

Sleep study seeks CMU students
By LAURIE WILKISON
Tartan Assistant News Editor
The Sleep Evaluation Center 
at the University of Pittsburgh 
is interested in paying people 
for their participation in sleep 
research. Their current study, 
called the Pittsburgh Study of 
Normal Sleep, aims to evalu­
ate the effects of sex and age on 
the sleep patterns of well- 
screened normal adult subjects.
The center, which is part of 
the university’s School of 
Medicine, is one of the world’s 
largest and busiest sleep labo­
ratories. While the center does 
see patients for sleep problems, 
85% of the 2,000 people that 
sleep there annually are there 
for the purpose of research. 
Researchers at the center have 
acquired a large amount of data 
relating to the effects of de­
pression and other medical 
disorders on patterns of sleep. 
They now need data from a 
thoroughly controlled study of 
normal subjects to provide a 
comparison for study.
Interested subjects will go 
through a process of screening 
so that researchers can look 
for any history of psychiatric 
or medical disorders.
Program Coordinator 
Patricia Cluss describes the 
process as “fairly intensive at 
the beginning.”
The screening process in­
volves three hours of face-to- 
face interviews and a short 
phone interview.
If potential subjects pass the 
initial assessments, all first 
degree family members will be 
interviewed. These members 
will be paid for their time and, 
when necessary, will be pro-
vided with means to get to and 
stay in Pittsburgh for the inter­
view. “Out-of-town family is fine 
and it is possible we could work 
something out by phone, if neces­
sary,” said Cluss.
“Most medical problems in 
family members are not going to 
rule people out,” said Cluss, who 
gave psychiatric seizures as an 
example of a disorder that would 
affect a subject’s eligibility. 
“People also should not rule 
themselves out because of a few 
days of depression or because they 
couldn’t fall asleep for a few 
nights,” said Cluss. “It has to be 
a diagnosable disorder.”
The study calls for subjects be­
tween 20 and 50 years of age. 
Fifteen men and fifteen women 
will be taken from each ten-year 
span with an additional 10 women 
between the ages of 45 and 49.
The center will be recruiting 
people over the next four years.
Subjects will be required to 
sleep in the lab for three consecu­
tive nights where their EEG 
patterns will be measured by 
electrodes. They come each 
evening at 8 pm and leave the lab 
during the day. This process is 
repeated twice at six-month in­
tervals.
Subjects will be paid at least 
$550 for their participation over 
this year.
Dr. David Kupfer, the principal 
investigator of the study, is one of 
the premier sleep researchers in 
the world. According to Cluss, Dr. 
Kupfer or one of the other physi­
cians will be willing to sit down 
and talk about the sleep patterns 
and EEG of any individual who is 
interested.
It is often said that people in 
adolescence through their early 
twenties do not need as much
sleep as other age groups. Ac- > 
cording to most studies though, > 
this age group, including the 
typical college age span, prob- 
ably need more sleep thanCi 
prepubertally. “Especially at a 
place like CMU, where there 
are all kinds of demands on I * 
your time, you have these two ¦-1 
forces working against e'achv* 
other,” said Cluss.
Cluss said that insomnia is -" 
probably the most common-; 
problem for college-age people J 
because it can be caused by so 
many things. A few nights of*" 
not being able to sleep are 
normal, said Cluss, but if the 
problem lasts every night for 
two weeks “you need attention.” 
Cluss warned against any kind 
of self-medication, like sleep­
ing pills, because they will 
eventually be the cause of in­
somnia.
Mary Carskadon, in a study 
of sleep patterns at Brown Uni­
versity, uses the phrase “twi­
light zone” to refer to the state 
brought on by sleep restriction 
which involves daytime sleepi­
ness and impaired perfor­
mance.
Many college students expe­
rience this “twilight zone” effect 
quite frequently.
According to Carskadon, 
students should be aware that 
this is not just the result of a 
hectic or erratic schedule which 
deprives them of sleep, but is 
also a result of the body’s 
natural increase in need for 
sleep at this age span.
Anyone interested in learning 
more about the Pittsburgh 
Study of Normal Sleep should 
call Dr. Patricia Cluss at the 
Sleep Evaluation Center in 
Oakland.

Students hope for war lecture series, await approval
By MARNI BOREK
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Students for Peace are waiting 
for confirmation this week as to 
whether their idea for lectures 
about the Persian Gulf War will 
be accepted by Student Affairs. If 
Student Affairs agree with the 
fllan, a schedule for the series 
about the Operation Desert Storm 
will be finalized.

Meeting called to order at 8:02.
Senators Present: Austin 
(MCS), Barnes (H&SS) (late), 
Blake (CFA), Dautermann (CIT), 
Gelman (MCS), Meek (H&SS) 
(late), Moran (CIT), Neighbor 
(CFA), Shin (H&SS), Wyatt (CIT).
Senators Absent: Bucholtz 
(CFA), Loomis (GSIA).
Ex-Officios Present: Dean 
Murphy (late), Rao (President), 
Dean Witchner.
Student Senate Chair — 
Chris Neighbor: There were 
many complaints about the elec­
tion. Some people were not on the
Gulf, many feel that there is not 
enough understanding of what our 
purpose is in the war with Iraq 
and what our basic motives are. 
The lecture series will provide a 
chance for students to learn about 
the war through the perspectives 
of various lecturers. They will also 
be able to ask questions and 
openly discuss their fears about 
the war.
“We would like to provide a non- 
confrontational setting in belief
ballot and were not notified of 
being taken off the ballot. Senate 
is absolved of the problem. This is 
A Phi O’s problem. We may be 
looking at a mis-election. Only 
one person that we know of was 
notified. A Phi 0 validated peti­
tions with spring rosters when 
they should have used last fall’s 
rosters. A request was made for 
specific steps to be spelled out 
when holding an election. A Phi 0 
opened the elections late both 
days: 11 am to 5 pm the first day 
and noon to 5 pm the second, 
instead of 9 am to 5 pm like they 
said they would. If the election is
that occasions for people to come 
together will provide a construc­
tive way to address the war,” said 
Amy deCamp, a History Grad 
student who is an advocate of the 
lecture series.
Students for Peace hope to hold 
lectures on such topics as foreign 
policy, cultural perspectives on 
the conflict in the Gulf, past con­
flicts in the Middle East, and a 
military perspective on the war. 
If enough people are interested,
the group hopes to hold lecture 
every week in time slots between 
4:30 and 6 pm.
Hope is high that the series 
could run through April, intro­
ducing other conversational top­
ics. However, this is dependent 
on the amount of student inter­
est.
“Additional presentation top­
ics could include the media and 
journalism; an international law 
perspective; a discussion of con­
scientious objection; and a per­
spectives panel offering insights 
from Israeli, Palestinian, Arab, 
Kuwaiti, and Muslim viewpoints,” 
said deCamp.
The only barrier for the lecture 
series is the wait for approval 
from Student Affairs with whom 
the Students for Peace wish to co­
sponsor the program.
Students for Peace has been in 
touch with Student Affairs rep­
resentative Katie Stannard.
“No monetary decision^ 
havebeen made for the program 
yet. The program addresses a ver.^- 
relevant topic,” said Stannard , 
It is possible that Student Af. 
fairs may approve of the lectures 
as early as this week. If so, the 
group hopes that they can

null and void, we might want to 
close down the body and let Stu­
dent Affairs set up some sort of 
funding body. This idea was shot 
down. Extreme dissatisfaction 
with the election board. Public 
Relations put up posters and an 
ad in The Tartan with the times 
that A Phi O said they would be 
holding elections. A Phi 0 didn’t 
seem to know or care that some 
people weren’t on the ballots. The 
only thing we can do is offer Mem- 
ber-At-Large status. Mike from A 
Phi 0 knows what he is doing, 
and so should those he trained.
A new room for Senate meet­
ings is being looked into. We’ll 
know Friday.
The computer was ordered, it 
should be in the office in two 
weeks. We’re looking into selling 
the old computer.
Find out how many papers are 
left and wasted, because by Fri­
day there are tons left all over the 
campus.
Next week, there will be up­
dated folders and New Members 
information.
Campus Affairs: Survey re­
sults: Not many people on cam­
pus were aware of the budgeting 
process. They also go on to say
that our budgeting is below aver­
age. Access to Student Senate is 
not important to the Campus. 
Written comments: the shuttle is 
unreliable.
New Business:
Special Allocation: Chess Club.
Money to send two teams to 
the 1991 Amateur Teams Cham­
pionship East: $926.
Vote: 6-0-3, passed.
General Discussion:
Chalk on the sidewalks: didn’t 
we vote against it? We voted for 
us to not write on the sidewalks, 
not to stop others, though.
Election counting begins at 9.
It takes three days to invalidate''1 • 
the election. Decision four days, 
after. Perhaps we just re-run tfie! 
elections for the colleges that 
had problems.
Anne Witchner strongly sug­
gested that Senate has a retreat ° 
or orientation.
Audience: Jonathan Levy's"; 
article in The Tartan was"14 
brought up. Response: he was J 
most likely very vague about tKe ‘ 
question he asked of the candi­
dates. It’s best that we ignore 
him and put it out of our minds.

Tartan News Editor
if normal college life were not dif­
ficult enough to deal with, the war in 
the Persian Gulf has brought up strong 
•eelings among the student body, and 
1(jeed, America as a whole, 
gut this, “The Theolog is In” stand, a 
take-off from the idea of Peanuts comic 
character Lucy, has been in business 
or three years now.
^Other things go on in life outside of 
)$ war that try people’s souls—people 
confronting themselves on issues they 
haven’t thought of before,” said Calvinist 
)rotestant Reverend Dr. James B. 
¿Her, director of the United Campus 
Ministry of Pittsburgh.
Although the format is maintained in 
est many of the questions they have 
jncountered are not. “A guy with a 
quarter came up and asked ‘ Who is God 
,nd why should I care?’ recounts 
jiith'eran Protestant minister Rev. Ruth
Becker.
The third member of the week’s panel 
is Rev. Gary Denning, a member of the 
First Baptist Church. Although all three 
are Christians, they point out that the 
differences between their denominations 
are substantial, and thus the purpose of 
their booth — to explore questions from 
differing religious perspectives.
So, while the theologians change from 
week to week, the panel maintains its 
diversity.
Despite the few transactions it con­
ducts, the group easily preoccupies itself 
with its own debates and struggles. Nev­
ertheless, it views it all as worthwhile, 
estimating that it averages one “really 
good question a day.”
One issue the group recently encoun­
tered was the question of where one can 
go to cry; where all the penned up anger, 
frustration, and uncertainty of the war 
with Iraq, or indeed anything for that 
matter, can all come out.
The theologians note the absence of a
sanctuary on campus, a place where you 
can “be who you are, express what you 
feel and be willing to grant others the 
right to express themselves too.” Fortu­
nately, they pointed out, the new Uni­
versity Center has a chapel planned in it 
which will ideally serve that end.
Not all of the questions are quite as 
serious. Some people “come with off-the- 
wall questions just to test how serious 
we are,” said Miller. The panelists have 
thus become rather adept at one liners, 
he pointed out.
As for the financial side of the opera­
tion, this panel’s till was overflowing — 
relatively speaking. The single day’s take 
of 45 cents is more than one third of last 
years total take of $1.20, all of which 
ultimately “finds its way to any number 
of charities.”
The panel is located in Kiltie Court 
every Wednesday from 2 pm to 4 pm, and 
good-humored as they are, they encour­
age anyone to come by, serious questions 
or otherwise.

1/25 THEFT 10:54 pm. A 
Samegie Mellon University stu­
dent left a pair of gloves on the 
ledge of the escort office. Realiz­
ing the gloves were missing, the 
student called the escort office 
and gave a description of the 
gloves, his name, address and 
phone number. Upon returning 
to the escort office, the student 
w&s informed that the gloves had 
allready been picked up. The com­
plainant is concerned that some­
one could pick up the gloves 
without the proper ID.
1/25 MEDICAL CALL 11:18 
pm. A CarnegieMellon University 
student working at S cotland Yard 
sliced his left index finger while 
cutting lemons. The student 
fainted momentarily. Upon re­
gaining consciousness, the stu­
dent decided to seek medical care. 
Said student was transported to 
Presbyterian Hospital.
1/26 MEDICAL 8:25 am. Two 
Samegie Mellon students re­
ported a man was passed out in

Wing. The reporting officer found 
Carnegie Mellon student 
sprawled out underneath two

locked. The man became alert and 
oriented when jostled by the offi­
cer. He stated he had a rough 
night and admitted to having been 
drinking alcoholic beverages. The

1/26 THEFT 12:13 pm. Vari­
ous items were reported missing 
from a Carnegie Mellon Univer­
sity student’s dorm room, includ­
ing a Pretty Woman video tape, a 
red clip-on lamp, and a package of 
five Maxell audio tapes. The vic­
tim reported that others living on 
the floor have experienced simi­
lar losses. The value of the miss­
ing items is approximately $27. 
The reporting officer strongly 
advised the victim to keep the 
door locked at all times.
1/26 MEDICAL CALL6:48 pm. 
A visiting Carnegie Mellon alum­
nus tripped while playing bas­
ketball in the gym and lacerated

ported to Presbyterian Hospital.
1/26 HARASSMENT 9:31 pm. 
A Carnegie Mellon student work­
ing at the Skibo information desk 
reported receiving prank calls for 
the previous five hours. The 
complainant stated the prank 
caller sounded like a white male 
in his early 20s. The prank caller 
repeatedly called, said “Fuck you,” 
then hung up. The complainant 
was advised that if the calls con­
tinued to contact Campus Police.
1/26 SIMPLE ASSAULT 11:40 
pm. The reporting officer observed 
a large group of people fighting at 
the Delta Upsilon house. Three 
officers responded to the call and, 
upon arriving at the porch area, 
found approximately one hundred 
students and guests. Several 
people were pushing and yelling 
at each other, but no one was in 
the process of attacking another 
person. Once the crowd cleared, 
the complainant was located on

charge can incur fines of up to 
$5000 and up to one year impris­
onment, or both.
The criminal conspiracy charge 
can incur fines up to $15,000 or 
up to five years imprisonment. 
The misdemeanor charges re­
ceived by the woman can incur

imprisonment or both.
A long and thorough search re­
vealed, in addition to the mush­
rooms, three false ID cards, a 
Phototron machine (suspected 
marijuana cultivation units), 
eight marijuana plants, a triple 
beam balance scale, a Right 
Guard can with a false bottom, 
and assorted paraphernalia.
The package recipient con­
fessed that he purchased the 
mushrooms for $900 from a friend 
“he had grown up with in Geor­
gia,” with intent to sell them for 
profit, but stated that he and his 
roommates grew the marijuana 
for personal use.
He also admitted they were

the porch and found to have been 
injured. The complainant had 
been punched in the left eye and 
nose, and had a small laceration 
above the eye. The victim and 
eyewitnesses identified a person 
responsible for the injuries; how­
ever, that person could not be 
located. Related versions of the 
story include reports of a Delta 
Upsilon brother in the process of 
removing unwanted guests and 
two females who were fighting. 
The victim was transported to 
Presbyterian Hospital.
1/27 THEFT 8:01 am. A Carn­
egie Mellon Physical Plant em­
ployee reported that someone had 
removed eight brass nuts and one 
glass diffuser from the newly re­
finished brass lamps at the main 
entrance to Doherty Hall first 
floor. The missing items are val­
ued at $20.
1/28 MEDICAL ESCORT 
12:01 am. A Carnegie Mellon 
student tripped while walking up 
the Skibo steps located next to 
The Tartan office. The spritzer 
bottle which the victim was car­
rying broke and lacerated her 
right palm. The victim was trans­
ported to Presbyterian Hospital.
1/28 MEDICAL 9:25 am. A 
Carnegie Mellon employee slipped 
on ice near the parking meters at 
the Morewood parking lot. The 
victim’s entire left side was sore; 
however, the victim preferred to 
transport herself to the hospital.
1/28 BURGLARY 10:27 pm. 
An anonymous caller reported 
that floor tiles had been removed 
from outside the 3600 corridor of 
Wean Hall and that a burglary
may have been in progress. The 
responding officers found two floor 
tiles had been removed from 
outside the locked door and one 
was removed from inside the door. 
The floor tiles are suspended over 
a framework allowing 10 to 12 
inches of clearance under the floor. 
No one was found in the 3600 
hallway and all the doors along 
the hallway were secure. The 
equipment stored in the hall be­
longs to the Computer Science 
Department and is used for vari­
ous government projects. A Carn­
egie Mellon employee in the vi­
cinity heard noises whieh sounded 
as if someone was going through 
the equipment; however, he did 
not investigate. The officers re­
placed the floor tiles and are 
waiting to hear if anything is 
missing.
1/28 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF 
11:32 pm. A Carnegie Mellon stu­
dent reported a broken window in 
McGill Hall. The responding offi­
cer spoke with the student and 
learned the student had broken 
the window because of stress 
caused by the student’s work load. 
The officer advised the student 
that the Counseling Center can 
help students with stress and that 
he would have to pay for the win­
dow. A maintenance report has 
been submitted to the Physical 
Plant.
1/29 THEFT 12:11 pm. A Car­
negie Mellon student reported 
someone entered Mellon Institute 
162-A by use of a key which is

removed the victim’s blue shoul­
der bag which contained: a
Mellon students. An investigation 
has begun pertaining to the sender 
of the package.
CMU Police Chief James 
LaPaglia stressed the importance 
of students contacting CMU po­
lice in the event of a city arrest or 
any legal problems. “We don’t 
want our students spending time 
in jail, if it’s not necessary,” he 
asserted. CMU Security was not 
notified until after the students 
were bailed out. He added that 
the Office of Student Affairs will 
arrange to have bail posted in 
these situations. Noting the seri­
ousness of the charges, LaPaglia 
called it, “no tea party.”
Dean of Student Affairs Michael 
Murphy declined comment on the
Hewlett Packard calculator, the 
victim’s checkbook, a notebook, a 
leather portfolio, 10 computer 
disks, a CMU library book, and a 
textbook. The total value of the 
missing items is approximately 
$310.
1/29 THEFT 6:48 pm. A Carn­
egie Mellon student’s black 
leather satchel bag, valued at 
$130, was stolen from Margaret 
Morrison room 320. The bag con­
tained a three-ring binder, three 
notebooks with class notes, film, 
and a mail order catalog. The 
notebooks had the victim’s name 
on them.
1/29 MEDICAL 6:52 pm. The 
victim reported dislocating the 
little finger of his left hand while 
playing basketball. The injured 
finger was bent at a ninety degree 
angle. The victim was given an 
ice pack and transported to Pres­
byterian Hospital.
1/29 WATER LINE BREAK 
9:26 pm. A security guard at 
Software Engineering Institue 
reported a water line break in the 
SEI garage and that the fire alarm 
was sounding. The guard shut off 
the main valve feeding the ga­
rage. Two fire trucks responded 
to the fire alarm. City firemen 
opened a drain valve to clear out 
the excess water. Apparently a 
frozen “T” fitting had thawed and 
blewout. The only damage was to 
the “T” fitting which had blown.
1/29 THEFT 5:00 pm. A blue 
26” Ross bike was stolen from the 
basement of Fairfax apartments. 
The victim stated that the bike is 
a signature model with no serial 
number available. The value of

1/30 PROTEST 12:09 pm. 
Twenty five protestors arrived at 
the main entrance to Warner Hall 
to protest Carnegie Mellon’s al­
leged involvement with Opera­
tion Desert Storm. The protest 
consisted of an anti-war banner 
and some speeches. The protest 
group attempted to enter Warner 
Hall to deliver a body ba.g to 
President Mehrabian. The pro­
testors were denied access; how­
ever, a single Carnegie Mellon 
student was escorted to the sixth 
floor where Dean of Student Af­
fairs Michael Murphy accpeted 
the bag in place of President 
Mehrabian who was not there at 
the time of the event. The protest 
then ended without further inci­
dent.
1/31 THEFT 12:00 am. A Car­
negie Mellon student reported 
that person(s) unknown entered 
Margaret Morrison room 32. A 
Chinon 35 mm camera was re­
moved from the room.
1/31 PRANK 8:45 am. A sec­
retary in the gymnasium athlet­
ics office arrived to work to find 
her sweater on its hanger, hang­
ing from the ceiling light. Further, 
person(s) unknown had flipped 
over the keyboard to the computer 
and disconnected some of the 
cables to the machine. This was 
all very odd to the victim. The 
complainant stated the doors are 
usually left unlocked to permit 
access to the coaches. The area 
will be kept secure in the future 
to prevent further incidents.

Small errors lead to big problems
Prof addresses issue of SUPA Dean
If someone tells you last week’s 
Student Senate elections were a 
smashing success, don’t be fooled.
Just because the elections have 
produced some new senators, don’t 
get too excited — the elections 
were pulled off with about as much 
grace as an elephant on a tight­
rope.
One problem lies in the petition 
validation process. Alpha Phi 
Omega, which serves as Senate’s 
elections board, discovered sev- 
, eral invalid signatures. Most of 
those belonged to students who 
weren’t in the candidate’s college, 
or who switched colleges this se­
mester.
That’s fine. Potential candidates 
were warned that they should get 
-more than 25 signatures in case of 
validation troubles later on.
But those whose petitions were 
ruled invalid needed to be notified 
that their name would not be on 
the ballot when they went to cast 
their votes. And, for the most part, 
they were notified. But there were 
a few who couldn’t be reached. 
Election Board Chair Mike Reed 
says he didn’t want to leave such 
sensitive news on an answering 
machine.
But leaving a message on a 
candidate’s answering machineor 
with a roommate is much better 
than not notifying him or her at 
. all. Electronic or campus mail also 
work.
For one candidate for an Indus­
trial Management seat, notifica­
tion of his invalid petition and 
subsequent removal from the bal­
lot came when he went to vote. 
Although he garnered a few votes 
as a write-in candidate, it wasn’t
If you re looking for a good way 
to spend some time this winter, 
think about checking out a CMU 
women’s basketball game.
Chances are, you’ll see the Tar­
tans win.
Whether its winning by a mile, 
or by the skin ofits teeth, the team 
is definitely on a hot streak.
Sporting a 17-4 overall record, 
the team has blazed a trail straight 
to the top of the University Athletic 
Association standings, where the 
Tartans have only lost once. They 
lost a close one this weekend at 
Emory University in Atlanta, 66- 
65.
Dropping out of the President’s 
Athletic Conference after lastyear 
to concentrate on the more com­
petitive UAA was definitely a good 
move. The Tartans leave no doubts 
as to their ability to compete with 
the best that NCAA Division III 
women’s basketball has to offer.
In fact, two weeks ago, the 
•women’s basketball team staged 
a stunning comeback victory over 
then number-three ranked Wash­
ington University. Losing by 15 
points at halftime, the Tartans 
played catch-up for the entire sec­
ond half to set up a last-second 
jump shot to secure the win. Fur­
thermore, the Tartans did this on 
the road.
At home, the Tartans are espe­
cially dangerous — and they’re 
enjoying storybook success. 
Boosted by the first-year contri­
butions of freshman Jeanine 
Megahan, superb bench depth, 
and Head Coach Gerri Seidl, the 
CMU has managed to remain 
undefeated on its home court. If 
things continue the way they have
enough to win.
Even if it was the candidates’ 
fault for not obtaining enough sig­
natures, they deserved to know 
the status of their petitions.
Although A Phi O notified as 
many candidates as it could, some 
did suffer due to carelessness.
Unfortunately, carelessness 
sometimes breeds apathy.
The IM candidate who was 
snubbed by A Phi O says he didn’t 
challenge the election because he’s 
too discouraged by the whole 
situation to want to become a part 
of Senate.
In fact, some Senators are 
questioning whether Senate as a 
body should exist at all.
Fortunately, the apathy isn’t 
completely infectious. CIT fresh­
man Adam Barksdale, whose pe­
tition was also invalidated and 
could not be reached, wanted to 
do something. He submitted a let­
ter to A Phi O challenging the 
election. However, his letter was 
not received until yesterday af­
ternoon, which is past the deadline 
stated in the Constitution.
Understandably, A Phi O has 
grown tired of doing what is largely 
a thankless job. The Student 
Government Constitution, how­
ever, also provides for an inde­
pendent elections board which 
Senate can appoint.
If A Phi O doesn’t want to handle 
the elections anymore, Senate 
needs to find someone who does , 
and who will give it the attention 
it is due.
And Senate needs to do it now, 
before another election rolls 
around — for the second or third 
time.
been going, the Tartans should 
see some playoff action.
That’s the good news.
The bad news is that this team 
and other athletic teams are 
starving for support from the 
university community.
At a school where athletes often 
go unsung, it’s a relief to see a 
team perform so well, despite the 
lack for enthusiasm around cam­
pus.
This lack of enthusiasm becomes 
painfully evident when compared 
to the amount of publicity the team 
has received off campus. Last 
week, Channel 11 (WPXI) ran a 
lengthy feature on the team. If the 
local media are picking up on the 
accomplishments of the women’s 
basketball team, then it’s about 
time the students did.
Admittedly, the Athletic De­
partment hasn’t done a perfect 
job in getting the word out. 
Frankly, it’s hard to go to a game 
if you don’t even know when 
they’re being played. We’re not 
asking for top-of-the-hour spots 
on CNN, but a little postering 
couldn’t do any harm.
But the choice ultimately lies 
with the fans. The women’s bas­
ketball team has done an excellent 
job representing our school, and 
it’s high time they got the respect 
and support they’ve earned.
So catch a game. The Tartans 
have three home games remaining 
— they play Friday at 6 pm, 
Sunday at 1 pm, and Wednesday, 
February 20 at 6 pm. Even though 
the Tartans are doing great with­
out massive campus support, a 
good turnout at a home game can’t 
hurt.
Editor:
Last week, you pub­
lished a letter from 
anonymous “con­
cerned SUPA stu­
dents” regarding the 
reappointment of A1 Blumstein as Dean 
of SUPA [“Dean of SUPA must be re­
moved,” 1/28/91], Much of the letter fo­
cused on the composition and function­
ing of a committee appointed to evaluate 
Dean Blumstein. The students raised 
three points about the committee, which 
led them to conclude that a “conflict of 
interest or bias” concerning thejudgment 
of the committee could “reasonably be 
inferred.” While I did not appoint the 
committee, as the committee chair I feel 
that it behooves me to reply to the stu­
dents’ letter. The letter contains a great 
deal of innuendo that is extremely mis­
leading and I want to reassure the SUPA 
and CMU community about the integrity 
of the evaluation process.
One of the main complaints of the 
students was that the committee is 
composed of too many individuals with 
ties to SUPA. The students’ letter noted 
that two of the committee’s five mem­
bers were full-time SUPA faculty mem­
bers and two were joint faculty with 
SUPA. It is instructive to put this claim 
into perspective by examining the com­
position of two recent Dean evaluation
Editor:
Mr. Pierce, I am se­
verely disappointed. In 
your column [“Make no 
mistake: Bush started 
war,” 1/28/91], you 
neatly state that Iraq’s Saddam Hussein 
“did not start this war ... George Bush 
did.” Clearly, this is an appropriate 
evaluation if one looks at war in a su­
perficial sense. I will grant you that. 
Furthermore, as your commentary con­
tinued, you repeatedly referred to 
President Bush as having “babies’ blood 
on his hands,” or being responsible for 
“bloody babies” and “civilians strapped 
into stretchers... bloody either with their 
own or someone else’s blood.” To this, sir,
committees set up under Dick Cyert’s 
administration to evaluate Dean Sekerka 
of MCS and former Dean Bailey of GSIA. 
The Sekerka committee contained five 
members, four of whom were from MCS 
and one of which chaired the committee, 
while the Bailey committee contained 
ten members, eight of whom were from 
GSIA. Thus, 80 percent of the members 
of both committees came from the college 
of the dean. The reason for this is fairly 
obvious—the committee members need 
to know a lot about the dean and his/her 
college to perform their job well. Thus, 
on the surface, the composition of the 
committee to evaluate Dean Blumstein 
appears to be quite similar to prior com­
mittees appointed during Dick Cyert’s 
reign, with 80 percent of its members 
apparently from SUPA. On closer look, 
however, the two committee members 
who are joint with SUPA are both based 
in H&SS; one of them is the Associate 
Dean of H&SS while the other (myself) 
does not hold a joint appointment with 
SUPA but instead is an affiliated faculty 
member who does not receive any salary 
from SUPA, has no duties in SUPA, and 
does not vote on SUPA affairs. Thus, on 
balance, our committee is less composed 
of insiders than prior dean evaluation 
committees without sacrificing any of 
the experience necessary to evaluate a 
dean.
I take profound offense.
Although you give token mention of 
Mr. Hussein’s remarkable level of pil­
lage and debasement of the people of 
Kuwait, the majority of your article is 
dedicated solely to criticism of the presi­
dent for his part in instigating this “cruel 
war.” I firmly believe that either you 
have not thoroughly thought through 
the ideological implications of your col­
umn, or you are speaking from a position 
of fear. I shall address both possibilities.
Clearly, most of us lack the necessary 
information to do a detailed analysis of 
the real reasons behind the entire Gulf 
conflict; however, a few facts become 
perfectly lucid: Mr. Hussein invaded a 
neighboring nation, unprovoked, issu-
The students’ letter also noted that “re- 
search money from SUPA has gone to at 
least two of the committee members," 
which in their opinion further compro- 
mised the objectivity and independence of 
the committee. Let’s take a closer look at 
this claim. When faculty members secure1 
grants from outside SUPA to support their 
research, a small portion of the overhead 
charged against the grant is put aside by 
SUPA. A fixed portion of this is given to 
the principal investigators of the grant to 
use as they wish. The Dean of SUPA has 
no discretion in this process in that under 
the current system these funds automati­
cally flow to the principal investigators. 
The remaining portion of these funds go 
into a central fund which is used to make 
small research initiation grants to SUPA 
faculty based on proposals they submit to 
a committee composed of the faculty who 
received the original grants. Once again; 
the dean has no role in allocating these 
funds. This is the only source of support 
received by any of the members of the 
committee that could in any way be la­
belled as “research money from SUPA.’ 
Surely no one would want to exclude 
anyone from serving on the committee to 
evaluate Dean Blumstein, who is a suffi­
ciently active and respected researcher to

Unify behind troops and against war

Letter to

Editor:
Allan 
Bourdius’ 
column last 
week [“To 
Support 
Troops, One Must Support 
War,” 1/28/91], demonstrates 
the author’s lack of rational 
thinking on the subject of the 
war in the Middle East. The 
premise of Bourdius’ argument 
— that Americans must sup­
port the war because failure to 
do so will result in our defeat— 
is simply ludicrous: I do not 
accept the author’s attempt to 
support his theory with an 
analogy to the Vietnam War, 
which he suggests America lost, 
or was not more successful in, 
because too few people back 
home supported the troops. I 
would propose that this had far 
more to do with the fact that we 
were fighting an enemy that 
we seriously misjudged and 
underestimated. Pentagon
planners did not comprehend 
the bigger picture and could 
not effectively m atch vague for­
eign, policy objectives with 
military tactics.
If the morale of our troops in 
the Middle East is low, it may 
have something to do with the 
punishing climate and less- 
than-scenic terrain of Saudi 
Arabia, the long wait and vague 
assurances given to them by 
President Bush, and the real­
ization that many of them are 
going to be killed. What is most 
important to the tro ops is not so 
much whether or not Ameri­
cans support the war so much 
as whether their fellow Ameri­
cans support them. Our ser­
vicemen are an exceptionally 
motivated, talented, and dedi­
cated group of young men and 
women of our own age. Given 
the dangerous conditions they 
are currently enduring, they 
deserve our utmost support 
regardless of our personal be­
liefs about the war itself.
Bourdius’ apparent belief 
that peace activists are the 
ones who are “in the way” of 
successfully achieving our na­
tional objectives is downright 
insulting, if not simply inac­
curate. Peace activists are 
rising precisely because they 
care about our troops and want 
them to come home safely, not 
in body bags. For Americans 
to “shut up” and let the gov­
ernment do as they please with 
human lives undermines the 
roots of our democratic system 
and questions our country’s 
true values. Despite endless 
arguments to the contrary, 
peace activists are probably, 
the most patriotic people in 
America. Activists value 
American lives and would like 
to see the billions of dollars we 
are wasting on this war allo­
cated to investments in 
America’s present and future 
—like education, medical care,
and housing for the poor—that 
will surely give us more of a 
return on our investment. All 
activists are saying is that al­
though they sympathize with 
the Kuwaiti people and hate 
Hussein as much as anyone else, 
we simply cannot resort to mass 
murder and spend billions of 
dollars that we do not have to 
make that point more emphatic.
Allow me to close with a re­
write of Bourdius’ last para: 
graph: Now that we’re fighting, 
the best thing we all can do is 
unify ourselves behind our 
troops and against the war. The 
greater the opposition we 
to the war today, the sooner the 
war will be over, the fewer our 
casualties (not to forget those of 
hundreds, perhaps thousands 
of civilians in the Middle East), 
and the sooner we can bring our 
young men and women home.

Demonstrators protest national media’s bias
ot
LrtUr lo Iho Editor
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
On January 
26,1991, we at­
tended the pro­
peace march in 
Washington 
p.C. Although we know that the 
march was covered by a Tartan 
reporter [“Thousands gather for
D.C. protest march,” 1/28/91], we 
feel it necessary to share with the 
Carnegie Mellon community our 
experiences. This is due to a dis­
turbing lack of coverage by the 
local, including Washington, and 
national television stations, news­
papers and other forms of mass 
media. In almost every case, cover­
age was limited and extremely 
misleading; details about the scope 
and breadth of the activities, par­
ticipants, and the basic scene were 
sparse and frequently inaccurate.
We joined the march at the base 
of the Capitol, where a rally was 
already in progress, and proceeded 
peacefully down Pennsylvania 
Avenue toward the White House. 
Other rallies and marches were 
scheduled throughout the city, all 
of which eventually converged at 
the Ellipse behind the White 
House. The only counter-demon- 
strators we encountered were
standing in a small group at 
Lafayette Park, in front of the 
White House, and were rather in­
effective in comparison to the 
masses of pro-peace demonstra­
tors. When we reached the end of 
the march route, there were still 
people just startingto march, about 
one and one-half miles up the road 
at the Capitol.
At the Ellipse we heard a num­
ber of moving speeches, including 
those by Molly Yard, the president 
of the National Organization for 
Women, and Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
The large range of speakers repre­
sented just a portion of the vast 
number of organizations that took 
part in the march and rallies.
Even though a number of well- 
known people spoke, media cover­
age was limited to a few seconds on 
thelocalWashingtoneveningnews, 
or a brief mention, if any, in print. 
While we continuously saw televi­
sion helicopters overhead, no over­
all aerial view was published or 
broadcast, which would have 
shown almost all of the 300 to 400 
thousand participants. Not only 
did the media fail to mention even 
remotely accurate estimations of 
the size of the crowd, they also 
failed to accurately represent the
Media coverage was limited to a few 
seconds on the local evening news, or 
a brief mention, if any,, in print.
marchers, even though we were 
filmed almost continuously along 
the march route.
Another inaccuracy was the idea 
that the crowd consisted primarily 
of students. While students clearly 
did make up a substantial percent­
age, there really were not enough 
of us present to substantiate the 
notion that the crowd was basically 
young, inexperienced, and naive. 
The truth is that the marchers 
were people of all ages and back­
grounds, including middle-class 
families with children, middle-aged 
and older people marching under 
their own banners, representatives 
of a variety of political and grass­
roots organizations, veterans of 
several wars and military actions, 
as well as all types of ethnic groups.
The march in Washington was 
not an anti-war rally, as it was 
described by many, but rather a 
pro-peace demonstration. Unlike 
the demonstrations of the Viet­
nam era, the vast majority of the 
demonstrators were in support of 
the troops, they just were not in 
support of the policies that placed 
them there. We personally were 
marching in support of the concept 
of the use of diplomacy rather than 
force, with the troops returning 
home as soon as possible. This is in 
direct contrast to the idea that we 
are “unpatriotic,” as the point of 
this would be to prevent unneces­
sary deaths of U.S. soldiers and 
citizens. An extremely large 
number of demonstrators carried 
U.S. flags, and there were many 
posters with slogans such as 
“Peace is Patriotic.”
Our group carried two banners, 
one of which said “Carnegie Mel­
lon, College of Fine Arts, Depts. of 
Music, Drama, MCS, Students for 
Peace.” The other read “Support 
our Troops — Bring ’Em Home, 
Carnegie Mellon University, Di­
plomacy Not Force,” on which we
collected 215 signatures from stu­
dents, professors and staff around 
campus. This banner was origi­
nally intended to represent the 
members of the music department 
who couldn’t march because of The 
Marriage of Figaro, but support 
was so great we decided to ex­
pand it to the rest of the Univer­
sity. As we marched along with 
these banners, a large number of 
alumni we encountered along the 
route expressed their joy and 
support of our actions. We would 
like to acknowledge all of the 
people who signed the banner and, 
of course, the many other Carn­
egie Mellon students who partici­
pated in the march.
We know that we can’t always 
believe everything that is printed 
in the newspaper or said on televi­
sion, but when reports are so 
skewed as to report such gross 
inaccuracies and discrepancies, 
and omit basic details, someone 
has to fill in the blanks.

Stereotyping shines in U.S. military
Jonathan Levy
I noticed something sort of 
strange a little while back. Two of 
the hottest issues of our genera­
tion seem to be how to stay out of 
the military and how to get in.
At the same time that some 
straight men are carefully 
studying the Selective Service 
rules and Swissair schedules in 
attempts to avoid the nonexistent 
draft, women and gays are asking 
to be allowed to serve and are 
being turned away.
Women are barred from serv­
ing in combat units, but in 
Panama and the Gulf have been 
allowed to get closer by serving in 
combat support units. Gays are 
not permitted to serve at all.
It may seem that both groups are 
better off than the straight males 
who now find themselves under fire 
in the Gulf. However, even in the 
midst of a war, women, gays, and 
the country as a whole are ill-served 
by this kind of discrimination.
Aside from issues of fairness, in­
creased access to educational aid, 
and all the other obvious reasons 
why women and gays should have 
equal opportunities in the military, 
there is another subtle, but impor­
tant, set of issues at stake.
Keeping women out of combat 
perpetuates the idea that they are 
more fragile and less competent than 
men. It also bars women from the 
rewards that have traditionally come 
to men who have survived combat.
The same is true for gays, who will 
continue to be stereotyped and held 
back as long as the federal govern­
ment, through the military, contin­
ues to insist that there is a connec-
tion between sexual orientation and 
the ability to serve one’s country.
War heroes are made in combat, 
and being a war hero, or even just 
someone who did his job and man­
aged to come out of combat alive, 
has traditionally translated into 
increased respect and opportuni­
ties back home.
I remember hearing Senator Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) tell how he got into 
politics. He said that when he got 
home after being severely wounded 
in World War II, he was visited by 
local representatives from both of 
the major political parties. Each 
tried to get Dole to run for office on 
his party’s ticket. The Republican 
representative, whose advice Dole 
took, told him, “You got shot. I 
think we can get you elected.”
Dole is now the Senate minority 
leader, and at the time I heard him 
tell this story, he was a leading 
candidate for the 1988 Republican
presidential nomination.
Obviously, not every combat vet­
eran has that kind of success, but a 
quick look around the houses of Con­
gress, the board rooms of major 
American corporations, or most other 
gatherings of successful straight 
male dominated groups will show 
that Dole’s mentor had this country 
figured out pretty well. Combat ser­
vice is a good way to get ahead.
I am not trying to deny that there 
are costs to combat service. There are, 
the most obvious one being the risk 
that one might not come home at all.
But the costs and benefits do not 
depend on gender or sexual orienta­
tion and the same should be true of 
the ways in which we decide who 
should be allowed—or, in the case of 
a draft, forced — to accept them.

A couple of weeks ago, I thought 
it was funny when our military 
'experts” predicted a nice, short 
>nd to the Gulf War. Despite all the 
footage that was thrown at me, I 
cept telling hiyself it wasn’t going 
to be that easy. I don’t think I’ve 
ever gotten less pleasure out of 
ieing right about something.
The worst part of it is that the 
Bush administration treats the 
Gulf War like some high-tech hu­
man chess game. Easy for them.
•ge isn’t going to be one of the 
people who gets tagged and bagged 
:housands of miles from home.
You can tell right away that 
they’re not taking the Gulf War 
¡eriously enough; they refuse to 
even call it what it is—a war. They 
teep using gentle terms like “con- 
lict,” “crisis,” and my favorite, 
‘situation.” In my book, the word 
'situation” is only followed by 
‘comedy,” and usually has some­
thing to do with bad 70s reruns.
Another sign of the apathy is 
that every member of Desert Storm 
continues to refer to Saddam 
Hussein as “Mister Hussein.” Not 
“president” or “general” or some­
thing like that; just “mister”—it’s 
like they’re trying to pretend he’s 
just some janitor who took over the 
building for the weekend.
The other attempt to de-legiti- 
mize Hussein is even more baf­
fling. They keep telling us how 
Hussein may be crazy, as if that’s 
supposed to make things better. I 
can hear it being said right now, 
somewhere near the Kuwaiti bor­
der. “Don’t worry, soldier. He has a 
huge ground force with tank and 
artillery support, as well as access 
to chemical and biological weapons, 
but he’s crazy.” Sure as hell doesn’t 
comfort me very much.
What makes this maneuver even 
more ludicrous is that Hussein 
probably isn’t crazy. Everything, 
from his attacks on Israel to the 
mostly diversionary act of dump­
ing oil into the Gulf, seems pretty 
well thought out. Except giving 
your best planes to the neighbor 
you’ve just been at war with for 
years; that move has got me
stumped at the moment.
But the worst problem with the 
treatment of Hussein by the United 
States lies on the battlefield. While 
Hussein builds up his ground 
forces, the Pentagon is breaking 
out the champagne every time the 
Air Force takes out a couple of 
Port-a-Johns in Baghdad. Hussein 
is ready to take this war to its 
bloody conclusion; we’re busy fig­
uring out which movie stars we 
want hosting our ass-kissing tele­
vised tributes to the soldiers.
The bottom line is that George 
Bush has painted the United States 
into amoral and economical comer 
that is going to require a long time 
and a high cost to get out of. I’ve 
become far too jaded (or is that 
realistic?) to hope for peace, and I 
know George Bush wouldn’t want 
to lose face by withdrawing.
Union General Tecumseh 
Sherman said it best back in 1864. 
“War is hell.” 127 years later, I find 
myself wishing our leaders would 
have learned that particular lesson 
a little better.

you can listen.
I’m from a small town and 
had never been confronted with 
the problem of rape until I came 
to this school. In the four months 
that I’ve spent here, two friends 
of mine have been raped on this 
campus.
Being a heterosexual male 
myself, I understand the desire 
to have sex and I know that 
after drinking for a while the 
urge is sometimes heightened, 
but that is no excuse to vio­
lently attack another human 
being. Both of the women have 
been seriously traumatized by 
these episodes and have had 
trouble even talking to their 
best friends.
Not only have they had 
trouble adjusting back to life, 
but their friends are having 
trouble dealing with the situa­
tion also.
There is absolutely no excuse 
for such a blatantly disgusting 
act. I know that some people will 
say that maybe it was something 
they did, maybe they brought it 
on themselves by the way they 
were acting, but I was with them 
during the night and I know both

No one has the right to violate

You people are sick and don’t

You will get your punishment.
You will be judged by an au­

Operation Desert Storm smacks of American self-interests

torial pages as well as

Letter to 
the Editor
this point, there are, nevertheless, over­
whelming reasons to oppose the war in 
the Gulf that your readers should inves­
tigate. Credit should go, however, to those 
who have been sufficiently schooled in 
Reagan-era politics to see through the 
lofty principles cloaking the cynical and 
mercenary purposes of “self interest” 
behind Bush’s rush to war.
The question, though, is who’s “self’ do 
we mean? Whose “way of life” is Bush 
concerned about saving? Of course he 
means those who will be vacationing in 
Kennebunkport again this year rather 
than those who have already begun to 
[jive their lives — African-Americans, 
Latino and poor whites from the slums 
pnd ghettoes of our country who make up 
a disproportionate number of the front 
lines. These latter are those who “volun­
teered” to escape a way of life that faces 
too many Americans: grinding poverty 
¡nd unemployment sent soaring in the 
?-980s. And for those who, with broken
bodies and shattered minds, manage to 
survive, what will they have to look for­
ward to when they return? Estimates 
suggest that 35 percent of today’s 
homeless are Vietnam vets. So among 
those who support our troops in Saudi 
Arabia now, who will support them when 
they return — those who consented to 
war abroad or those who demanded 
economic justice at home?
So, yes, while we, like the protesters in 
their polypropylene underwear, depend 
upon oil (though not so much from the 
Gulf) and the economy in general, it would 
be wrong to forget that some Americans 
benefit from it far more than others. 
Moreover, if we depend on the economy, it 
is also true that the economy depends 
upon us — where else does it come from? 
America’s wealth is not owned by the 
Bush administration to dispense with as 
it pleases while we passively accept every 
misadventure our leaders decide to launch 
in our name. Rather, it is the obligation of 
each of us to see that our resources are 
produced and distributed responsibly.
And what of our enemy-of-the-week? 
Those fated to die on the other side are not 
the savage, sub-human fanatics it would 
ease our conscience to believe, but the poor
and patriotic of their own country, misled 
and terrorized into service. This is to say 
nothing of civilian dead about whom, like 
the three to seven thousand Panamanians 
killed in Bush’s last experiment in free­
dom, we may or may not ever hear. And as 
you read this, we are nurturing next week’s 
Saddam Husseins, as we have done with 
the present one, and will continue to do so 
until we address the causes of conflict, 
rather than its symptoms, and recognize 
our own longstanding complicity in main­
taining the antagonisms ravaging the 
Middle East.
Despite a barrage of months of war- 
mania in which the media wondered what 
war would be like, rather than what could 
be done to stop it or why Bush wanted it so 
badly;, despite promises as the deadline 
approached of a short and tidy little war 
(some Washington officials had the nerve, 
you’ll remember, to tell us victory in five 
and even two days); still, polls indicated 
that only half of the American public was 
convinced of the wisdom of such a venture. 
Even Congress, waiting until the eleventh 
hour to broach the subject, was split on the 
use of force. A shift in public opinion after 
bombs began to pom- down on Iraq indicates 
to me that Americans had swallowed the
myth of their powerlessness before the 
whims of authority and figured it was too 
late to do anything but pray that pro­
nouncements of brevity trotted out by 
officials might be true.
Now, however, as the military prepares 
for phase two, a long and bloody ground 
war, we’re being told not to expect any­
thing too soon, that it could be months — 
as if war planners didn’t know this at the 
outset. But let’s not fool ourselves: if we let 
this ground war happen, it’ll be murder. 
The fireworks (“better than Disneyland”) 
and Nintendo graphics will give way to 
images of carnage, fighting will drag on 
with “successes” more difficult to discern, 
reports will leak back about Iraqi casual­
ties, and remains pouches will begin to 
flow back containing what’s left of sons, 
daughters, spouses and lovers, and all this 
blather about American military capabil­
ity will be increasingly exposed for the 
hollow rant that it is.
So take your pick. Economically, politi­
cally, morally, and as a matter of foreign 
or domestic policy — this war is simply a 
bad idea. It was before it started, and now, 
as disasters unfold, it still is. The final 
little irony is that while the Administra­
tion spends $1 billion a day on Operation
Desert Storm with money it doesn’t have, 
it’s us, the American tax payers, that 
again will have to pay for this mess. But 
find out for yourself. Don’t rely on the 
dominant media, though, as it gleefully 
sells us human misery in War in the Gulf: 
The Series, by far the hottest mid-season 
replacement ever. Fortunately, there is 
still a remnant of credible journalism left 
in such publications as The Nation, In 
These Times, The Village Voice, The 
Guardian, and our own Student Union. 
Find out and get involved, but don’t be 
surprised if you don’t find the retro-hip- 
pies re-enacting the Wonder Years we’re 
supposed to believe make up the Peace 
Movement. Instead you’ll find a broad 
cross-section of the American people in­
cluding senior citizens, parents, profes­
sionals, veterans, children, members of 
Gay Rights, Women’s Groups and even 
fraternities who have enough sanity left to 
demand an end to this poorly conceived 
blundering that passes for policy. Find 
out, if it isn’t already clear, why an imme­
diate cease-fire and a negotiated settle­
ment is a better answer.

can figure out no other basis for 
claim, then they have seri- 
Du^y ^represented the situation, 
lie students made two other
¦ a>ms about the committee mem- 
Jei s, both of which apply to the two 
U '^ine SUPA members of the 
ommittee. They noted that one of 
' 1.ese members was junior and the 
Ilei Wl'ote his dissertation under
ean Blumstein when he was a
¦ 1 student at SUPA. In the case 
}* junior faculty member, they
nutted that she is an experienced 
acu ty member who brings a dis-
omitted that he received his PhD 
from SUPA almost 20 years ago, 
that he subsequently was a faculty 
member for 12 years at Ohio State, 
that he never collaborated with 
Dean Blumstein on research, and 
that he was hired by SUPA dur­
ing the tenure of the prior dean, 
Brian Berry.
Besides their attempts to mis­
lead the university community, 
the students also neglected to in­
quire with me about any of the 
procedures the committee is fol­
lowing, none of which is confiden­
tial. The committee’s charge was 
to elicit opinions and inputs from
larly the deans of the other col­
leges and various university ad­
ministrators.
If the students had contacted 
me, they would have learned a 
great deal more about how com­
prehensive the committee’s efforts 
are to ferret out all the informa­
tion, both pro and con, concerning 
Dean Blumstein. Among other 
things, we compiled a detailed 
confidential questionnaire to 
evaiuate Dean Blumstein that 
was sent to all current SUPA 
faculty, all SUPA faculty on leave, 
and all faculty members who left 
SUPA during Dean Blumstein’s
tenure. The questionnaire not 
only asked for numerical rankings 
of Dean Blumstein’s performance 
on 43 different dimensions, but it 
provided six open-ended questions 
for respondents to express their 
views. We also scheduled inter­
views with all current SUPA fac­
ulty, the associate deans of SUPA, 
a representative of the SUPA ad­
ministrative staff, a representa­
tive of the SUPA secretarial staff, 
and numerous past and present 
university administrators. Fur­
thermore, to provide for student 
representation, we arranged for 
interviews with elected represen­
tatives of three different groups 
of SUPA master’s students and 
with a representative of the SUPA 
PhD students, each of whom was
asked to caucus with his or her 
constituent group in order to 
represent their views. (These 
groups are still in the process of 
caucusing their groups.) In order 
to canvass those who might har­
bor the most critical views of Dean 
Blumstein, we also' offered to in­
terview any faculty member on 
leave, any faculty member who 
left during Dean Blumstein’s ten­
ure, and a few former administra­
tors who left SUPA under possi­
bly strained circumstances. In 
total, we will conduct over 50 in­
terviews.
Why have we gone to such lengths 
to evaluate Dean Blumstein, atruly 
arduous and time-consuming task 
for a committee of only five faculty 
members? The answer is simple:
This is not merely an evaluation of 
Dean Blumstein but an opportu­
nity to appraise the state of SUPA 
and to suggest measures to im­
prove SUPA regardless of who the 
next dean is. This is the principal 
dividend that can be reaped by the 
committee members.
Performing this role well re­
quires that the committee be objec­
tive and unstinting, which is why 
our efforts are so comprehensive. I 
only wish that the anonymous stu­
dents who voiced their concerns 
had asked me about the committee 
and its procedures before publish­
ing their misleading letter.

Early V-Day soothsayers know zero
David Cohen
On the wall of my bathroom is a 
framed Time magazine cover of its 
“Man ofThe Year” for1965: a statue 
in mottled stone of General Wil­
liam Westmoreland, then the hero 
of the Vietnam conflict. In the last 
few days, I’ve looked at that picture 
as I never have before. It may not 
teach a lesson, but it certainly of­
fers a warning.
That warning, so prosaic as to be 
trite, comes down to this: No one 
can know what will happen in a 
war. And yet, for all our experi­
ence, we have the spectacle of some 
of the usual suspects forecasting 
not only the course of the war but 
its political consequences. From 
the Hotline, a daily political 
newsletter, comes a compilation of 
quotes (originally printed or spoken 
elsewhere) from people who seem 
to know everything except when to 
keep their mouths shut.
On the presidential prospects of 
Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), who 
thought a war should be delayed, 
we get a rush ofinstant judgment's: 
“Nunn benefits from this,” says 
pollster Stanley Greenberg, a
Democrat. Another pollster (and 
another Democrat), Geoff Grain, 
says that Nunn “probably made 
some converts in his own party.” 
Ed Rollins, a Republican campaign 
official, begged to differ. “I think 
he’s the biggest loser in all of this.” 
Precisely correct, opined another 
Republican pollster, Linda DiVall: 
“Nunn is a loser.”
Having considered Nunn, the 
Hotline then reported what has 
been said about other potential 
presidential candidates. At least 
in print, not one of the experts 
noted that when Time elevated 
Westmoreland to its self-created 
pantheon, Lyndon Johnson was 
President, having been elected by 
a landslide in 1964. By 1968, the 
war had ruined his presidency.
Some of Hotline’s quotes reflect 
the conviction, validated by expe­
rience, that what counts most in 
the media age is not to be right, but 
merely to get into print or on the 
air — the quicker the better. Few 
people ever go back and check what 
was said. The same might be said 
for journalists themselves. Being a 
columnist is a lot like Eric Segal’s 
line about being in love: You never 
have to say you’re sorry.
But at the same time, to predict
the war’s effect on domestic poli­
tics reflects a naive view that events 
are both containable and control­
lable, that the present context will 
persist. There is a sense that this 
will happen and then that will 
happen and a certain outcome will 
be achieved. If anything, that 
conviction has been deepened by 
computer simulations. See: There’s 
the outcome.
But life is seldom so neat. Just as 
surely as Sam Nunn’s thinking 
now seems to have been wrong, so 
will George Bush’s (or Senator A1 
Gore’s) if this war turns into an 
American debacle. Anyone with 
any memory can tell you about 
Ernest Gruening and Wayne 
Morse, the two senators who voted 
against Lyndon Johnson’s Gulf of 
Tonkin resolution. Within years, 
they went from being considered 
nuts to downright prescient. Let’s 
put it this way — almost alone in 
the Senate, they would not, years 
later, have changed their vote.
America is now engaged in a 
vast, dangerous, and somewhat 
unpredictable enterprise. So many 
historical precedents are available 
as analogies that history itself has 
been reduced to babble. Even 
Vietnam, so recent and so well-
documented, turns out to have been 
a national Rashomon experience 
The lessons I got from that war— 
lessons that tugged, puppy-ljke 
even as I concluded that war, not 
sanctions, was the only way to get 
Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait-. 
are now said to be without foun. 
dation. I am now told we lost in 
Vietnam because the military was
hobbled and the press irresponsible
— not, as I thought, because we 
had no business being there and 
the enemy was indomitable.
Nothing original can be said 
about wars. But certainly in the 
long run they are unpredictable 
undertakings and what seems like 
defeat can, with the proper politi­
cal slant, be turned into victory. 
Ask an Egyptian which nation won 
its 1973 war with Israel.
But in Washington and else­
where, we have a group of people 
who not only seem to know how the 
war will turn out, but what its 
political consequences willbe ayear 
or so down the road.
I invite them all, singly, into my 
bathroom. In more ways than one 
it’s the right place for their quotes.

From Gettysburg to Khafji: Wars only change in intensity
George F. Will
Saddam hopes to force America to fight 
iifrthe ground before air bombardment 
.has substantially “attritted” his defenses. 
Jl&qi and U.S. forces locked even momen- 
,tamly in equilibrium on the ground would 
provide the stark symmetry that would 
iserve Saddam’s political aims if he survives 
to boast about it.
77'Saddam’s aim is for American casual­
ties to reach the threshold at which U.S. 
decision-makers flinch from the additional 
»violence required to eliminate his regime. 
His premise is: If he survives the fighting, 
¡he.wins. So his war aim is to prevent 
-America’s achievement of an objective 
,America has not yet set: something ap­
proaching unconditional surrender. 
/{•'Most victories have been something less 
^han total, often because the victors wanted 
ifcthat way. The cost of achieving or ad­
ministering unconditional surrender can 
be prohibitive.
American policy is to inflict from the air 
sufficient attrition on Iraq’s defenses to 
achieve American war aims — whatever 
they eventually will be — without cross­
ing the crucial threshold to intolerable 
casualties.
What is that threshold? No one knows. 
And no one knows how long the battle now 
raging will last because no one knows the 
dynamics of today’s battlefield. But ac­
cording to John Kegan, one of today’s 
foremost students of battles, for centuries, 
battles have become bigger, longer and 
more lethal.
Agincourt (1415) lasted j ust a few hours. 
Waterloo (1815) was a three-day ordeal 
for some soldiers, a day for most. 
Gettysburg (1863) spanned three days. 
But in the First World War, Passchendaele 
lasted three months, the Somme four, 
Verdun ten. Battles have become more 
intensely lethal as they have lengthened.
A particular British battalion that suf­
fered 61 percent casualties at Waterloo 
and 70 percent at the Somme 101 years 
later suffered its casualties at Waterloo in 
three hours and those at the Somme in 30 
minutes. The width of the “killing zone” 
was 200 yards at Agincourt, half a mile at 
Waterloo, and nearly five miles at the 
Somme.
In spite of all the big guns, most of the 
fighting in the Second World War was, 
says Kegan, as earth-bound, snail-paced 
and soft-skinned a business as it had been 
for the 200 preceding years. There were a 
quarter of a million tanks manufactured 
during the Second World War.
But, says Kegan, the tank, though it has 
transformed the pace and appearance of 
modem campaigning, has not changed 
the nature of battle. The focus of fighting 
may be shifted 20 miles in a single day by 
an armored thrust, but wherever it comes 
to rest there must take place exactly the 
same sort of struggle between man and
man which battlefields have seen since 
armies came into being.
What has changed radically, even in 
recent decades, is the intensity of the 
ground combat experience. For about half 
a century, it was thought that the intro­
duction of gas into warfare by the Ger­
mans at Ypres in 1915 brought 
unsurpassable (short of nuclear weapons) 
deadlines to the battlefield. But, says 
Kegan, subsequent advances in metal­
lurgy and projectile design enable me­
chanical killing devices to make the 
battlefields even more lethal by filling the 
air with metal.
Rather than training individual marks­
men to hit particular targets, armies now 
train small infantry groups to create an 
impenetrable zone. Many automatic 
weapons are effective only for filling a 
small area with bullets, an activity re­
quiring no more skill than spraying a 
kitchen with an aerosol insecticide.
What Kegan calls a “new superfluity of
killing agents,” buried beneath the soil 
(mines) and wafted by breezes (gas) and in 
solid form in the air (other projectiles), j 
makes today's battlefields more lethal than 
previous ones.
Wednesday’s Wall Street Journal re­
ported: “Soldiers in the Army’s elite Sev­
enth Corps, which is likely to play a 
leading role in a ground offensive, have 
stayed up in recent nights, sitting in 
their hot chemical-warfare suits in re­
sponse to alerts. Some officers worry 
that the nightly alarms will hurt their 
troops fighting ability.”
This could cause commanders to think 
they face a “use them or lose them” di­
lemma. But given what we know about 
likely losses from ground combat, the most 
welcome words spoken at Wednesday’s 
briefing were from Gen. Powell: “We’re in 
no hurry.”

Student pipes up on making Carnegie Mellon nearly smoke-free
on
Letter to 
the Editor
Editor:
""On February 1,1991, the Uni- 
: falsity of Pittsburgh, in the inter­
est of public health, banned 
smoking and the sale of tobacco 
products on most of the campus.
' * Qver winter break, Carnegie Mellon, in the inter­
est of public health, removed the cigarette machine 
‘frttm the E-tower walkway in Morewood. This ac­
tion had almost no effect on the smoking habits of 
the campus community, except that those wishing 
iS^uy cigarettes now must go to Entropy.
-"There have been many studies that have shown 
health risks of smoking, to both smokers and 
‘people who breathe “second-hand” smoke. These 
studies have linked smoking and breathing second­
hand smoke to lung cancer, emphysema, and preg­
nancy problems.
Because of these findings, many public build­
ings, including state and federal buildings, and 
private buildings have banned smoking in most 
areas. My high school banned smoking on campus 
in 1988. The company where I worked over the 
summer banned smoking in all areas of its building 
this past October. I think it is time for Carnegie 
Mellon to jump on the smoke-free bandwagon.
In the interest of public health, Carnegie Mellon 
has to start moving towards a smoke-free campus. 
This should include the following ideas:
1. Ban smoking in all public areas on campus. 
This should include all classrooms, computer 
clusters and hallways in all academic buildings as 
well as all hallways, reading rooms, clusters and 
other public gathering places in the dormitories
and other campus buildings. Students and faculty 
would have the right to allow smoking in their dorm 
rooms and offices, but the smoking should be con­
fined to these private areas. On the doors on some 
campus buildings, a sign reads “No smoking except 
in designated areas. Violators are subject to fine.” 
On most other doors, this warning has been partially 
or totally removed. Carnegie Mellon should replace 
the warning on the doors and place prominent “No 
Smoking” signs in other public areas. Let’s see 
people take this warning seriously. I agree that 
people have a right to smoke, but others shouldn’t 
have to breathe the smoke as well. Smoking should 
be confined to private offices and dorm rooms.
2. Enforce the “No Smoking” rule. The signs on 
the doors say people who are caught smoking will 
be fined. I have yet to see this rule enforced. By
enforcing this rule, people will think twice about 
lighting up in academic buildings.
3. Stop selling cigarettes on campus. Cigarettes 
can be bought in Entropy, the Co-Op, and from 
cigarette machines in certain buildings. If people 
really have to smoke, they shouldn’t mind walking 
down to the Uni-Mart on Craig Street.
4. Encourage people to stop smoking. This should 
include sponsoring smoking cessation seminars, 
having support groups, and providing literature 
explaining the dangers of smoking.
Cigarette smoke is not healthy for anybody. We 
all should make an attempt to make Carnegie 
Mellon smoke-free.

{mass destruction not simply 
agMnst enemies, but against his

All of these reasons certainly 
factored into Bush’s decision. He 
confronted not only Saddam 
Hussein, but also a bipartisan 
legislative coalition that wanted 
him to follow the sanctions-only 
policy that you so wholeheartedly 
embrace, despite the fact that the 
nation’s chief intelligence official 
stated pointedly that sanctions 
“simply would not work.”
That policy, as so much damn­
ing evidence points out, would 
Jiaye allowed Mr. Hussein to es­
cape and perhaps rape another

of fear, I consign you to the les­

ife-that you object to?
‘••Is it armed combat in particu-

Or is it fear that maybe you

country?
If it is armed conflict to which 
you object, then I ask you, what if 
we had not fought the Revolu­
tionary War?
Would you still be so passionate 
as the citizen of a British colony? 
What about the Civil War? Maybe 
you would be satisfied with 
Americans in chains.
The examples are endless, and 
they beg the question, Mr. Pierce 
— is there anything worth fight­

cally: Yes!
There are things worth fight­

dom from tyranny and insane,

the President and this nation’s 
Congress to whom the world owes 
a hearty “thank 3rou”—they made 
the tough decision at the eleventh

Those who 
can’t do, write 
about it
Last Monday, I received a 
truly tragic lesson in how things 
are almost always harder than 
they look. After covering basket­
ball for The Tartan for nearly 
two years, I decided to take my 
shot at the ranks of intramural 
competition. Armed with my 
wealth of vicarious experience 
and a single practice, I joined 
my team for a pleasant evening 
match with the quite innocent- 
sounding ATI squad.
We might as well have been 
playing the Detroit Pistons. A 
description of my first intramu­
ral basketball effort reads like 
the opening credits of The Six 
Million Dollar Man. The other 
team was faster, stronger, 
better. The only thing missing 
was the tacky red sweatsuit.
Although the final score was 
33-20, we didn’t play that bad a 
game; we just weren’t very 
organized. On defense, we 
.committed too many fouls and 
never really got our coverage 
•assignments ironed out. On 
offense it was just poor re­
bounding, poor shooting, and 
not enough passing.
The other major problem was 
a lack of teamwork. Our great­
est showing of unity and coop­
eration turned out to be getting 
everybody* to wear a white T- 
"shirt to the game.
I’m as guilty as anyone, 
especially on offense. The 
newly-dubbed McDonald rule 
for basketball would read, “If 
you’re being double-covered in a 
corner, an off-balance fall-away 
jump shot would be a very bad 
idea.”
One of the first lessons I 
¿earned is that wearing the 
same color shirt as the referee, 
while pretty much unavoidable, 
is a sure ticket to trouble. An 
(easy outlet pass turned into an 
even easier two points for the 
other team with an assist to the 
official’s back. The only positive 
note is that it was a really good 
pass — hard and accurate. The 
fact that he wasn’t on my team 
was just a slight technicality.
Lesson number two: Being on 
the receiving end of a pick is 
one of the least pleasant experi­
ences a person can have. While 
i pretending I was playing 
(defense, I came face to face with 
¡Tree #2 (they had three Trees

ATLANTA, GA - The Carnegie 
Mellon women’s basketball team 
suffered its first University Ath­
letic Association defeat of the 
season yesterday, fallingto Emory 
University by a score of66-65. As 
well as being the first UAA loss 
against nine victories, the Tar­
tans’ overall record dropped to 
17-4 as a result of yesterday’s 
loss.
“The key to the game is that we 
were sufferingfrom a definite lack 
of intensity,” said Head Coach 
Gerri Seidl.
The game started out looking 
like an easy Tartan victory as the

The men’s and women’s track 
teams traveled to Slippery Rock 
University to compete against 15 
other teams on Friday. Scores 
were not kept since the meet was 
a pratice meet.
Men’s head coach Gary Meckley 
was much more pleased with his 
team than last week. “We looked 
much better than last week. There 
was Slippery Rock [in first placel 
and there was us.”
The men had eight good perfor­
mances including sophomore 
Brad Shapiro’s mile time of 4:25, 
junior John Frieder, 4:29 in the 
mile, sophomore Sean Pempel’s
Tartans got out to a 15-5 lead. 
Sophomore Chandra Buist led the 
way early, scoring eight points in 
the opening rally. Buist would 
score 14 of her 16 points before 
the intermission.
After peaking at an 11-point 
lead, the Tartans cooled off and
2:03 in the half-mile, and senior 
Todd Balbera with 4:32 in the 
mile. Two 55-meter runners, 
Chris Mcguire and Brandon 
Woodward, ran 6.7 seconds and 
6.8 seconds respectively.
Three runners, freshman Eric 
Tabor, freshman Jarrod Siket, 
and senior Jeff Illion, improved 
significantly in last week’s meet. 
Tabor ran very strong consider­
ing he missed all of the cross­
country season because of an in­
jury. Illion and Siket improved 
their 440 yard run by one to one 
and a half seconds.
Meckley was particularly im­
pressed with his team since they 
looked better against more diffi­
cult competition last Friday than
found themselves tied with four 
minutes left in the half. CMU ran 
off eight late points and went into 
halftime with a 32-26 lead.
“We weren’t playing good team 
defense, especially in our man-to- 
man,” said Seidl.
Early in the second half, the
two weeks ago against easier 
teams.
Meckley still considers the in­
door season mostly practice. “If 
we start taking them too seri­
ously we’ll be in trouble,” Meckley 
said. The strategy for most indoor 
meets is to run people in different 
events to get them a good work 
out as well as getting them some 
competition.
Women’s Head Coach Dario 
Donatelli isn’t worried about do­
ing well in meets yet. “Until we 
really get down to the last few 
weeks of February and UAAs [In­
door Championshiplthat’s when 
things really start to count,” he 
said.
The outstanding women indi-
Tartans still seemed to be in con­
trol of the game, yet they were 
unable to pull away from the 
Eagles. Then, midway through 
the period, junior forward Amy 
Buxbaum injured her knee, and 
after trying to play injured, she 
had to leave the game.
At that point, the tide of the 
game seemed to briefly swing back 
toward Emory. The Eagles took 
their first lead of the game with 
8:22 left in the game, but CMU 
came right back and ushed their 
way to a six point lead, 60-54, 
with 4:28 on the clock.
Depth became a key issue of the 
game when freshman forward 
Jeanine Megahan fouled out with 
2:42 left. Without Megahan and
viduals were junior Carlyn Lowe 
with a 5:22.9 and fourth place in 
the mile, freshman Jodi Piccolo 
with a triple jump of 29’ 7” and 
sixth place in the long jump, and 
junior Lois Raska with her best 
time of the year (2:36.4) in the 
half-mile and sixth place. Senior 
Sue Sparks and Emily Berke took 
fifth and sixth respectively in the 
two-mile.
UAA loss
Buxbaum inside, the TartanS 
struggled down the stretch. 
Emory’s Gale Graham missed her 
attempted last shot but was fouled 
by sophomore guard Kelly Sterr 
ling. Graham converted the first 
of two free throws with one secj- 
ond on the clock to win the game 
for the Eagles.
“It’s crucial when two of your 
starters are out,” said Seidl. “It 
takes away our strength insidet 
At least we had a lot of youth iij 
there getting experience, and I 
hope that will pay off in the end.?

Megahan added eight more re­
bounds.
On Friday night, the Tartans 
came back from a 10-point half- 
time deficit to beat New York 
University, 70-68. Although the 
Tartans shot above .500 on the 
game, NYU’s defense stifled the 
Tartans in the first 20 minutes, 
allowing only 24 shots while forc­
ing 16 Carnegie Mellon turnovers.
The Tartans began the game as 
the dominant team, going on a 
14—5 run over the first seven 
minutes of play. The Violets came 
right back, though, putting seven 
unanswered points of their own 
on the board. The next several 
minutes were an even game as 
both teams turned up the defen­
sive pressure.
Unfortunately for Carnegie 
Mellon, the Violets owned the last 
four minutes of the half, rattling 
off 13 unanswered points. Senior 
forward Jocelyn Katsock scored 
three times in the final minute to 
give the Violets their 39-29 half- 
time advantage.
“I was glad they came out in a 
zone,” said Seidl. “They really got 
us when they changed to man-to- 
man. It was really well-played, 
and they really put a lot of pres- 
, sure on us.”
The Tartans came out hot in 
the second half, but still found 
themselves on the short end of a
double-digit lead after six min­
utes. Fortunately for the Tartans, 
Megahan came to life after a sub- 
par performance in the first half.
“It wasn’t really anything they 
were doing,” said Megahan. “It 
was more myself.”
Megahan would finish the game 
with 16 points, all coming in the 
final 14 minutes of play.
After a quick seven point run 
cut the lead to 47-42, chopping 
down the remaining Violet lead 
proved to be a slow task. The 
Tartans didn’t tie the game until 
the seven-minute mark, and 
didn’t take the lead for good until 
the final two minutes. A late 
seven-point run put the Tartans 
up 69-64, and they were able to 
hold off the final NYU charge for 
the victory.
“I felt really relaxed,” said Seidl. 
“There was a period, between the 
media and the national rankings, 
where we got caught up in it, and
I think we’re back to where we 
were before. We’re more relaxed, 
and we’re playing well and play­
ing as a team.”
“It was just the attitude we 
stepped on the court with in the 
second half,’’said Megahan. “We 
realized we had to go out and get 
it done because we didn’t want to 
lose to NYU on their court.”
After the game, a small contro­
versy developed when the Violets 
left the floor without shaking 
hands. “I wasn’t really happy 
about that,” said Seidl. “They
played hard, and they shouldn’t 
have felt badly about it. I would 
never let a team of mine act in an 
unsprtsmanlike manner.”
Buist led the Tartans with a 
career-high 20 points; Buxbaum 
added 13 points and a game-high 
14 rebounds.
In the week’s only nonrUAA 
contest, the Tartans disposed of 
Thiel College by a score of 64-56. 
Megahan led the Tartan attack 
with 23 points and nine rebounds; 
Sterling and Buxbaum added 14 
and 13 points, respectively.
This week, the Tartans will host 
a Friday-Sunday series against 
Washington University and the 
University of Chicago. The Tar­
tans defeated both teams on the 
road in mid-January, but with 
the uncertain status of Amy 
Buxbaum’s injury, the Tartans 
know they’ll have to be at their 
best to kee their UAA title hopes 
alive.
“We’re going to have to execute 
and shoot the ball, because they’re 
both big games,” said Megahan. 
“Washington University is espe­
cially important because that’s 
the conference championship in a 
nutshell.”
“We’ll have to play good team 
defense,” said Seidl. “Everyone 
will have to realize the importance 
of participating at their fullest.”
Friday’s game against Wash­
ington starts at 6 pm; tipoff for 
Sunday’s game against Chicago 
will be at 1 pm.

by a nine point W&J run.

Ice hockey stuns Indiana University of PA for first wilt
By DAVE MARTIN
Tartan Staffwriter
The CMU hockey team hung on 
' to surprise Indiana of Pennsyl­
vania, last year’s league champi- 
; onSi 5-4, Saturday night at the 
Neville Skating Rink. Erik Galis, 
a graduate student who played 
undergraduate at Notre Dame, 
led the way for the Tartans with 
¦ two goals and an assist, while 
junior Dave Sealfon kept the Tar­
tans alive with 46 saves for the 
' Tartans first win on the ice.
IUP opened the scoring with a 
goaljust2:13intothegame. Jun­
ior Ed Kilduff tied the game at 
:22 in the first with the assist 
from Galis. The Tartans scored 
i 3:11 as Kilduff dished off 
the puck to Galis for the goal. 
Throughout the first period, the 
IUP Apaches had two power plays 
that availed them nothing, while 
the Tartans missed on only one, 
i penalties were few.
CMU dominated the second pe­
riod, as junior George Mueller 
came over the blue line and fired 
line drive into the net past a 
sleeping goalkeeper to put the 
short-handed Tartans up 3-1 with 
11:45 remaining before the inter-

mission. IUP scored only 20 sec­
onds later, and again at 8:14 on a 
power play to tie the game. But 
CMU came right back, and Gary 
Keim scored off the assist from 
Mark Li, who played Division I 
hockey for Cornell, only 23 sec­
onds after the tying goal. With 
4:04 left in the second, Galis closed 
out the Tartans’ scoring with his 
second goal assisted by Jamie 
Sabian on one of the few power 
plays for the Tartans to go into 
intermission leading 5-3.
The third period was a defen­
sive struggle, as the Tartans 
played fiercely to protect their 
lead. IUP scored on a power play 
with 5:50 left to tighten the game. 
The remaining minutes of the 
game became a battle for the Tar­
tans, as the Apaches attacked the 
goal continuously. But time-con­
suming passes to the empty end 
of the ice, a valiant defense, and,
remarkable play from goalie Dave 
Sealfon, who had 19 saves in the 
third period alone, helped to hold 
on to the victory for the Tartans.
“Dave Sealfon played a great 
game,” commented coach Dave 
Collins. “I felt we played a strong 
defensive game.” Coach Collins 
also noted after the Tartans’ first 
win that he has hopes of a better 
semester for the club hockey team. 
Team captain Ed Kilduff said af­
ter the game, “We have the best 
first line in the league. I don’t 
think we’re going to lose any more 
games as long as we have a full 
team.” Kilduff was involved in a 
fight after the game ended which 
resulted in disqualifications for 
both him and the IUP player he 
fought. Kilduff says he intends to 
protest the penalty. The IUP coach 
also stated that he would take his 
player’s disqualification to the 
commissioner of the league.

Public Apology- Senate Elections
The Public Relations Committee would like to take this 
opportunity to apologize to the Student Body for the mix-ups with 
the recent election.
The Public Relations Committee publicized the recent election. mi 
According to the Student Senate Constitution, the Student Senate can "" 
not take part in the running of elections. This is the responsibility of the 
Election Committee, which is under the control of A Phi O. ,
A Phi O was responsible for running elections, setting up the polling 
station, validating petitions, and notifying the candidates of their 
petition’s validity.
'fli
— On both days, the voting stations opened late.
— No sign was posted at the election site announcing the election.
— Several candidates, whose petitions were invalidated, were never ;
notified.
It is now up to A Phi O to determine the validity of these elections.
The members of the Public Relations committee are sincerely sorry for 
any inconvenience these mistakes have caused the Student Body and 
Student Senate.
Sincerely,
Student Senate Public Relations Committee !

Swim teams end season with home loss to SRU
By DAN GALLAGHER
Tartan Staffwriter
The swim team held its final home 
meet Saturday, in a losing effort against 
Slippery Rock University. The team is 
how 3-2 in dual meets.
Both the men’s and women’s teams 
took first place in several events. For the 
women, freshman Denise Fenwick and 
senior Leslie McGill finished first in the 
100-yard freestyle and 200-yard back­
stroke respectively. “I won in the blink of 
an eye,” said Fenwick, after touching the 
wall less than a second ahead of the 
runner-up. Senior Jo Wollschlaeger
swam just as well, winning three events- 
—the 200-yard individual medley, 200- 
yard butterfly, and 200-yard breast 
stroke. Her time in the breast stroke also 
qualified her for national competition.
For the men’s team, junior Brian 
Zimmerman won the 200 and 500-yard 
free style competitions. The men also 
placed first in the 400-yard medley relay, 
outpacing their Slippery Rock opponents 
by just a tenth of a second. Anupum 
Narula, a freshman on the relay, de­
scribed the win as the best split time of 
the season. “We were behind until 
[sophomore] Ted Beatty caught up in the 
last seconds,” he said.
“Even though it was close, I knew I’d 
won,” Beatty said.
Competition during the meet was in­
tense, with first and second place often 
separated by tiny time differences. 
“Toughest team so far,” observed Denise 
Fenwick. Slippery Rock is a Division II 
team, and its only defeat thus far has 
been against a Division I rival, according 
to Anupum Narula.
The CMU team swims next at the 
University Athletic Championship, and 
the swimmers have high expectations. 
“We’ll probably finish third or fourth,” 
said senior co-captain Paul Moran. 
“Everyone’s in top shape,” agreed Denise
Fenwick. “We should do really well.” 
With two weeks until the champion­
ship, Head Coach Bruce Bronsdon plans 
to rest his swimmers. “We’re cutting 
back on yardage and trying to wind 
down,” he said. “We really aim the whole 
season towards the conference meet.” 
Coach Bronsdon sees the conference 
meet as an opportunity to register for 
national competition. “Jo Wollschlaeger 
already qualified. Brian Zimmerman 
will, and maybe a few others,” he said.
Bronsdon believes that a well-rested 
relay team also stands a good chance of 
finishing under the NCAA’s stringent 
qualifying times. Relay team member
Ted Beatty explained the training 
method. “We’re tapering now, which is 
mostly doing sprints so we don’t break 
down our muscles.” The coaches will de­
termine who races in the relay event 
based on practices and other factors.
But qualifying times may not guaran­
tee a chance in the national competition 
National competitions prefer relay teams 
consisting of individuals with qualifying 
times in other events. “Nationals pay the 
bus ride costs, so they want more than a 
good relay team,” Coach Bronsdon said
Though it’s still too early to judge sea­
son results, Coach Bronsdon is satisfied 
“We’re right on track,” said Bronsdon.

Strip District merges Pittsburgh’s cultures

By DANIEL HOLLAND
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
When I sought out a part of 
the city with cultural diver­
sity, a unique shopping area, 
an engaging nightlife, and a 
slice of historic Pittsburgh, I 
found the Strip District, 
sandwiched between Penn 
Avenue and Smallman Street 
downtown. In the early hours 
of the morning, trucks thun­
der into the Strip, bringing 
wholesale goods to be dis­
tributed throughout the city; 
by midday, the Strip becomes 
a bustling center of activity.
Upon arriving in the Strip, 
my nose finds Whole/s Fish 
Market on Penn. This one-of- 
a-kind market looks like it 
belongs in a Baltimore fishery, 
the kind where the workers 
scale and behead the fish right 
before your eyes. But I can 
also get afresh, juicy, breaded 
fish sandwich smothered in 
tartar sauce at Whaley’s, and 
that makes it a little easier to 
. forget the fish guts lying 
around everywhere.
The marketis cold, but I am 
much better off than the doz­
ens of live lobsters crawling 
around inside a plexiglass 
tank, waiting to adorn 
someone’s dinner plate. The 
conspicuous killing of the 
lobsters may fall short of be­
ing labelled “humane,” but at 
least here I get to see the 
action as it happens. Although 
it’s not quite as bad as Upton 
Sinclair’s The Jungle, life in­
side Whole/s is a far cry from 
the Giant Eagle frozen fish 
section.
That is part of the beauty of 
the Strip District—the small, 
family-ownedbusinesses have 
remained remarkably resil­
ient to the larger grocery 
chains, a pleasant reminder 
that the little guy has not been 
completely squeezed out. No, 
in the Strip I have to work to 
find what I want; it is not on 
aisle 15, next to the Fruity 
Pebbles.
Formerly the main market 
and warehouse distributorfor 
Pittsburgh, the Strip still sells 
wholesale goods and attracts 
people from all over to come 
and enjoy its assortment of 
home-grown styles. Things 
have not changed much since 
the 1930s, when it was a 
crowded, Boston-like, ethnic 
marketplace with a mixture 
of Polish, German, Irish, and 
Italian shops. More recently, 
the Strip has included Chi­
nese and Greek storefronts, 
keeping with the tradition of 
ethnic diversity.
Although I have to do a lot 
of walking, shopping in the 
Strip is much more ftm than 
shopping in some gargantuan 
mall or plaza. I could spend 
an hour just viewing the 
storefronts and sampling 
what’s inside. In Alloto’s Pro­
duce, my mouth waters at the 
sight ofthe bountiful tables of 
fruits and vegetables. I stuff 
several apples into one bag, 
plums in another, grab a 
canteloupe and head for the 
line to the cash register. I
continue across the street 
and enter the Pittsburgh 
Oriental Food Mart, Inc. to 
grab abagofdriednoodles, 
try some tea I have never 
heard of, and browse 
through the colorful mer­
chandise advertised in 
Chinese and English. And 
I can always stop in at Fat 
Frank’s and sample 
“Pittsburgh’s Best Hot J Dog,” where only the most 
selective palate can be the 
judge.
This is the Strip during 
the day. At night, things 
change. Those who have 
not been to Metropol, the 
industrial dancingclub, are 
missing out on one of 
Pittsburgh’s best night­
clubs.
Inside is a massive Pal­
ladium-like dance arena 
complete with a stage for 
live music, an upper level 
for over-21s and colored 
lights flashing in my face. 
Club MTV it’s not, but, in 
Pittsburgh, this is defi­
nitely the place to be.
At night, the Strip Dis­
trict is also home of 
Prim anti Brothers’ famous 
cheese steak sandwich, 
which they claim is their 
“number two best seller,” 
making mewonderwhatis 
number one. But at 1:00 
am, just after a hot stint of 
industrial dancing, the 
cheese steak is just the 
I meal to hit the spot. It 
seems that all of 
Pittsburgh’s night dwellers 
have crowded into 
Primanti’s, fighting to get J to the counter and order, 
impatient to chomp into 
that juicy slab of meat 
topped with fries, cole slaw, 
and provolone cheese on 
Italian bread, conveniently 
cut in half. I have experi­
enced this delicacy at the 
Oakland Primanti’s, but 
the original Primanti’s in 
the Strip established in 
1933 is an experience that 
rivals “O” fries in the level 
of greasy satisfaction.
Upon leaving the estab­
lishment, I will almost 
certainly run into the 
doughnut man who 
emerges after midnight, 
selling hot, fresh dough­
nuts out of the back of his 
van, for those of us who did 
not get our fill at 
Primanti’s. I may wake up 
the next morning with a 
headache from too much 
dancing and a churning 
stomach from too much 
cheese steak or too many 
doughnuts, but it was 
worth it."I Andifthatisnotenough, 
I can always head down to 
the Strip another day and 
find a store which I have 
never seen before. There is 
always something new to 
discover in the Strip Dis­
trict — I guarantee it.

Javi clears the air of “The Future of Man”
In his 1969 essay, “The Future 
of Man,” theorist Teilhard 
DeChardin argues that “no one 
can deny that a network of eco­
nomic and psychic affiliations is 
being woven at ever-increasing 
speeds which envelops and con­
stantly penetrates more deeply 
within each of us. The idea is that 
the Earth is not only covered by 
myriads of grains of thought but 
becomes enclosed in a single, 
thinking envelope so as to form no 
more than a single Vast grain of 
thought—the plurality of reflec­
tions grouping themselves to­
gether and reinforcing one an­
other in the act of a single 
unanimous reflection.” DeChardin 
placed this layer of homogeneous 
thought somewhere over the at-

over the atmosphere and named 
it “the noosphere.”
As inspiring as DeChardin’s 
words are, this account of the 
commonality of human thought 
does not account for static. Static 
is that which keeps the noosphere 
from realizing the extent of its 
power. Static is shared and gen­
erated by all human beings, and I 
postulate that it is the force which 
keeps the mind from developing 
faster than the natural evolution­
ary expansion of the cranium. If 
there truly is a common experi­
ence in all of mankind, it is the 
experience of static.
The thoughts which follow are 
examples of static as I have expe­
rienced it within the last twenty- 
four hours. I make no claim as to 
their originality, but present them 
only as an example of the junk 
culture of the collective uncon­
scious.

CMU students bring education front closer to home
January 13,1991
I am standing on Vaci Street in 
Budapest, Hungary, with trays of choco­
late brownies in front of me, and multi- 
~ iingual signs around me describing our 
merchandise.
“TRY SOME DELICIOUS HOME- 
. MADE AMERICAN CHOCOLATE 
BROWNIES!” I say in English, and 
wonder if anyone understands. Many 
,llh§§fld strange looks my way, for most 
.,, Hungarians don’t speak English and have 
, .never seen or tasted this type of chocolate 
^cake.
.. ...Since Vaci Street is in the tourist dis­
trict we attract a few English speakers 
who are familiar with brownies. Slowly, 
we manage to convince others to give our 
homebaked delicacies a try. The cus­
tomers are never disappointed, and many 
_try to extract my boyfriend Jeffs secret 
-'recipe.
>• This evening, as we stand freezing in 
the cold and offering to Europeans what 
-hAìs?to us the “best thing about America,” 
we are approached by two foreign-look-

ing students.
“Where are you from?” we ask. Since 
we advertise in over 20 languages, we 
often try to detect the nationality of our 
customers by observing their reactions 
to our advertisements. These boys are 
not quick to answer.
“We’re from Iraq,” one finally offers. 
The other timidly jokes about the possi­
bility of poison in his brownie.
Jeff tries to converse with them about 
the Gulf situation, but they don’t offer 
much. Perhaps they are uncomfortable 
about speaking openly with us, or per­
haps they are uncertain of their personal 
opinions, but they certainly enjoy our 
homemade brownies.
A young Israeli girl corrects our He­
brew advertisement. She willingly speaks 
about the crisis. In her eyes, war is inevi­
table. Yet she is quite confident about 
her country’s military capabilities and 
she seems surprisingly calm, undisturbed 
by the possibly impending events.
The evening’s business progresses 
slowly. During its course, we share 
brownies with persons from Italy, Jor­
dan, Portugal, Turkey, South Africa, and 
Lithuania. The crowds have dwindled 
because of the extreme cold, so we begin 
to pack up.
We have only two brownies left when 
six well-dressed boys approach. All six 
tell us that they are engineering students 
from Kuwait. Impulsively, we mention 
our conversation with the Iraqis, and 
instantly regret the tactless comment.
They laugh, and one says, “Come on, 
I’ve got Iraqi friends, too!” We share a 
few more words; most tell us that their
relatives are safely residing in other 
countries.
At the last minute, one boy purchases 
a brownie, and they all wander off. Within 
minutes, this brownie buyer is back and, 
to our great surprise, orders a whole tray 
for the following day.
January 15,1991
Two more evenings of brownie selling 
have come and gone. We have spoken to 
many, including some Syrian customers, 
who openly support Hussein. For them, 
he is a figure who can unite and 
strengthen the Arab nations.
In addition, the Iraqi students have 
returned again and again. Although they 
still refuse to comment, they are now two 
of our many “regulars.”
January 17,1991
I was prep aring for be d when the phone 
interrupted, bringing the news: “The lib­
eration of Kuwaitis underway.” I thought 
of all the people that we’ve met while 
selling our American brownies; the smiles
and conversations we’ve shared with 
Kuwaitis, Iraqis, Israelis, and others.
What had started as a desperate ;a 
tempt to earn petty cash had grown into 
something more_a cultural experience 
that I will never forget.
As I write, two trays of brownies lie 
cooling in the kitchen, and I think abou 
tomorrow. Our roommate suggests tha 
we don’t try to sell any more.
After all, the war has begun. He f6el 
that it is unwise for us to openly adver 
tise anything American, no matter how 
harmless, on the street.
Perhaps we are naive, but I don’tttiin] 
that we can let this war destroy the 
interesting, educational, multi-nationa 
social gatherings that occur each evening 
around a simple brownie stand.
I have only one thought as I fall askep 
“How many times must the cannonballs 
fly?“

Alumni spirit alive at CMU
gy CHARLES SABATOS
Tartan Staffwriter 
& MEGAN DIETZ
.Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Although the CMU-emblazoned 
'curtains on Steve Merrick’s office 
Windows indicate his level of 
School spirit, his dedication be­
comes more than obvious once he 
'speaks. “I consider myself very 
’fortunate to be in this profession 
and to work with staff and volun­
teers that so deeply love the in­
stitution,” says Merrick, CMU’s 
assistant vice president and di­
rector of alumni relations.
1 Alumni directors are required 
1 fo wear many hats in carrying out 
their job. “In a given period of the 
day, I can listen to an alumnus 
questioning the priorities of the 
Robotics Institute, or the defen­
sive secondary coverage in the 
last football game, or the status of 
,the new University Center,” says 
Herrick. “You learn to be a cheer­
leader, a listener, an advocate, 
and a bridge to assist in university 
and alumni-related issues. It’s 
challenging and it’s fun.”
As director of alumni relations, 
Merrick has overseen this year’s 
.Homecoming celebration and its 
accompanying ten class reunions 
as well as events held for groups 
of regional alumni, called clans. 
Jn fact, on a recent trip to Detroit, 
the local clan, made up of mostly 
.automotive engineers, asked the 
Alumni Association to bring a 
CMU robotics professor to De­
troit to speak about state-of-the-
art developments in the field. 
Merrick is excited by the idea: 
“We’re going to be tying together 
two of CMU’s greatest strengths, 
the alumni and the robotics staff.”
The Alumni Relations staff of­
fers many services to the alumni, 
such as helping them find jobs 
other than entry-level positions 
and providing the Alumni 
Association’s Board of Directors 
with manuals to help them do 
their jobs with more proficiency 
and professionalism. As Merrick 
is quick to point out, “We’re really 
trying to meet the needs of today’s 
alumni. It’s not just Homecom­
ing.”
Also among Merrick’s goals is 
increasing alumni involvement 
with the present student popula­
tion. The Student Alumni Rela­
tions Committee (SARC) has been 
organized to achieve this end. 
Comprised of about fifteen stu­
dents, SARC acts as the student 
arm of the Alumni Relations staff, 
working towards “communication 
and interaction between students 
and alumni,” Merrick says.
Merrick enjoys this aspect of 
his job as well. “Much of the fun of 
being an alumni director is 
working with the future alumni, 
the students!”
However, the services provided 
by the Alumni Relations staff are 
not the only part of the picture. 
“Alumni involvement works both 
ways,” says Merrick. “J.t’s not just 
what the university can do for its 
alumni, but also what alumni can 
do in service back to their alma
“Your diploma is not just a piece of 
paper or a line on your resume. It's a 
part of your life, and one you should 
be proud of. ”
— Steve Merrick, 
director of alumni relations
mater.”
According to Merrick, there are 
five ways in which an alumnus or 
alumna can give something back 
to the school: “Recruiting stu­
dents, providing knowledgable 
advice, serving on ... committees 
of the institution, providing em­
ployment opportunities to stu­
dents and alumni, and making a 
financial support commitment to 
the institution.”
Financial support can be very 
important to students receiving 
financial aid, because much of the 
non-government funded, in-house 
grant money given to students 
comes from contributions from 
alumni. However, alumni have 
more to offer students than 
money. Says Merrick, “One of the 
major roles alumni can play is to 
ensure the institution maintains 
the hig-quality standards and 
traditions established in the past.”
One of Merrick’s primary con­
cerns for both alumni and current 
students is school spirit. “Wher­
ever we travel, the immediate im­
pact and image that Carnegie
Mellon has on people is very pow­
erful and impressive,” says 
Merrick. “Alumni and students 
should be proud of this interna­
tional reputation.”
Although pride for Carnegie 
Tech is very strong in the alumni, 
Merrick sees school spirit waning 
in current students, a larger and 
more diverse group than past 
classes. “You find it [school spirit] 
in pockets,” says Merrick, “par­
ticularly among the Greek sys­
tem and in certain organizations.”
Graduation may seem very far 
away for many students, but 
Merrick remains convinced that 
alumni relations are important 
not only to the alumni, but to the 
present student population as 
well. “When you take your di­
ploma, you’re taking something 
with you wherever you go, and it’s 
not just a piece of paper or a line 
on your resume. It’s a part of your 
life, and one you should be proud 
of.”
Although this is only Merrick’s 
first year as alumni director here, 
he held the position at both

College betöre coming to CMU. 
He has also worked in the alumni 
department at the University of 
New Mexico and the University 
of Wisconsin.
Merrick is active in organiza­
tions associated with his profes­
sion as well. He belongs to the 
Council for Advancement and 
Support of Education and the 
Council of Alumni Association 
Executives. He also chairs the
National Education Alumni 
Trust, Inc., an insurance trust 
which works for 135 alumni asso­
ciations around the country.' '
Merrick calls the University of 
Minnesota, where he earned:-his 
bachelor’s degree, his alma-ma­
ter, although he received"his 
master’s degree from the Univer­
sity of Wisconsin.
Merrick lives in Bethany, West 
Virginia, with his wife and three 
children.
The American Outhouse: forging the perfect gift
WHAT CULTURE!
I was so consumed by the lavish art 
¦exhibits, clever inventions, and the sheer 
expression of humanity in all its glory 
jam-packed into every page of 
Smithsonian magazine that I came dan­
gerously close to taking a Turkish 
sponge-bath in the sparkly, benzene- 
tainted waters of Perrier.
But ya know, the Smithsonian cul­
turing process doesn’t stop with the “oh 
so neat” pictures and articles, but runs 
deep into the advertising campaign of 
the magazine. In fact, it wasn’t until I 
stumbled upon an ad for a mail-order 
piece of literature entitled The Vanish­
ing American Outhouse that I began to 
truly appreciate the amount of class and 
integrity the people at Smithsonian 
manage to cram between the pages of 
their sophisticated monthly.
To think that renowned author Ro­
nald S. Barlow had the courage to step 
forth and recreate the raw beauty and 
back-to-nature experience that the 
Standard Company snatched away from 
all of us so many years ago.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO 
PLATINUM BLONDES?
by Andrew Cosentino
Barlow knows as well as the next guy 
that real men go — to say it carefully — 
outside. Frailty, thy name is plumbing. 
His book contains “over 200 photos and 
drawings of American outhouses con­
structed between 1830 and 1940” and 
it’s “packed full of serious history, folk­
lore, and country humor too.”
“Hear that Billy Bob? Country humor 
too! Now run and tell Punkin’ Puss.” 
One can only imagine the wonderful 
folklore built around the American out­
house —rich stories which can be handed 
down through many generations. Years
from now, your children’s children will 
still be telling quaint little anecdotes 
about the tale on page 59 where, in the 
year 1890, uncle Jimmy James Jamie 
Jay-boy Wyler played “a real good one” 
on Great-grandpa Bo by sliding the 
frame of his outhouse over a badger 
hole — a single act which set off an 
enormous epidemic of outhouse pranks 
all over the prairie and ended in the 
near extinction of the badger.
For all you people out there who have 
that burning desire to learn more about 
primitive outdoor waste facilities but 
don’t like to read all that much, this 
book offers the only solution with hun­
dreds of “prize-winning photos.” These 
include a section of celebrity photos 
featuring action shots of Michael 
Landon and Merlin Olson relieving 
themselves at various outhouses on the 
set of Little House on the Prairie.
Proud to be the R.I.F. Bookmobile’s 
number one seller, The Vanishing 
American Outhouse, because of its 
“large type-size,” is also the perfect 
starter for kids who are just being in-
¡iBBÊFiBâB
A History of Country Plumbing 
by Ronald S. Bario»-
courtesy The Smithsonian 
troduced into the bountiful world of 
reading.
The newly added pop-up and scratch 
’n’ sniff sections alone promise to pro­
vide hour upon hour of enjoyment for the 
youth of America.
Not sure where in the home you’d put
such a fine work about outhouses?-Ad­
vice from the literary consultants .over 
at the esteemed firm of Windmill Pub­
lishing is to “order a copy for your 
bathroom bookshelf.” But why not follow 
in the footsteps of football great Dan 
Deirdorf and countless fraternities (and 
possibly sororities) by simply putting 
The Vanishing American Outhouse in the 
reference section of your library, ri£ht 
next to Really, Really Funny Fart Jokes 
5? “Dude, it’s a really good book. I’m 
learning so, like, much.”
More good news. The Vanishing 
American Outhouse “is a great gift for 
the over fifty crowd.” This can only mean 
that despite the current body of research 
on the issue, the bathroom humor st&ge 
that we all knew and loved during early 
childhood indeed goes full circle to make 
itself prevalent once again just in time 
for retirement. So much to look foward 
to. If only the years could go by a little 
faster.
Andrew Cosentino is a ... oh, come.on, 
you already know who this guy is. \

Gérard Depardieu has starred 
in some of the best movies of the 
past fifteen years, but unless you 
like subtitles, you’re probably not 
familiar with him or his work. 
Depardieu is French, and while 
he seems to appear in every good 
French movie, including Danton, 
Jean de Florette, and Cyrano de 
Bergerac, in each of which he 
played the title role, those films 
are usually restricted to limited 
runs at the Pittsburgh Playhouse.
Things may change with the 
release of Green Card, the new 
movie directed by Peter Weir 
(.Dead Poets Society) which fea­
tures Gérard Depardieu in his 
first major English-speaking role.
The movie is seen from the per­
spective of Bronte Parrish (Andie 
MacDowell), a fanatical horticul­
turist who will do anything to get 
a certain apartment with a fabu­
lous rooftop greenhouse. Unfor­
tunately, the owners will only rent 
it to a married couple, so she de­
cides on a fake wedding. George 
Faure, a French composer, has 
similar motivations — he wants 
to get a green card, the first step 
to American citizenship.
— Movie Review —
' '' vSTTt 4CSpn A mis­
matched couple marry to obtain a 
green card and a dream apartment. 
Starring Gérard Depardieu, Andie 
MacDowell, and Bebe Neuwirth. 
Directed by Peter Weir.
Things begin rather quickly. 
Within the first ten minutes of 
the movie, Bronte meets George 
through a mutual friend and they 
get married. He then leaves for 
good and she starts to get on with 
her life. But before she can get a 
quiet divorce, the immigration 
authorities become suspicious and 
begin to investigate (marrying 
someone for a green card is a 
criminal offense).
Bronte panics, and convinces 
George to stay with her and keep 
up the façade until the investiga­
tion is over. Meanwhile, she tries 
to keep him a secret from her 
family and friends, with little 
success. But this is a romantic 
comedy, of course, and when the 
two are threatened with separa­
tion, they find that they have 
fallen in love.
Gérard Depardieu is excellent,
turning his thick French accent 
(“What did he say?” the lady be­
hind me kept asking) into a comic 
asset. He’s an appropriate “oaf,” 
as MacDowell calls him, but 
makes the composer side of his 
character believable. One of the 
best scenes occurs when George, 
at a dinner party, is urged to play 
something he’s written. He starts 
out with embarrassingly unhar- 
monious pounding and thumping 
on the keys, but shifts suddenly 
into a beautiful melody accom­
panied by French lyrics. In the 
same way, Depardieu eases be­
tween “oafishness” and tender­
ness.
On the other hand, MacDowell 
is disappointing, failing to live up 
to her performance in sex, lies and 
videotape. Her greatest fault is 
overacting — she breathes in 
heavily with delight at her first 
sight of the greenhouse, shouts 
stormily at George for his imposi­
tion on her life, and weeps as if 
her heart is broken when she 
thinks she is going to lose him 
after all.
Bebe Neuwirth is good as 
Bronte’s best friend, but to me 
her reedy voice is inseparable from 
her frigid character on Cheers, 
which is totally different from the
bohemian artist she plays here. 
The other characters aren’t shown 
enough to make much of an im­
pression, including, surprisingly, 
Bronte’s boyfriend Phil, who 
might have been a more effective 
foil to George’s crudeness had he 
been further developed.
Overall the movie is enjoyable, 
and the lack of development 
among the lesser characters and 
subplots is actually effective, 
making the plot more realistic. 
The ending is strangely unsatis­
factory, however, thwarting the 
characters’ expected resolution 
but injecting the scene with too 
much sappiness to keep it appro­
priately downbeat.
But as a film about a self-cen­
tered woman living in a gorgeous 
Manhattan apartment, Green 
Card is certainly preferable to 
Woody Allen’s recent release, 
Alice. And it is ideal as 
Depardieu’s introduction to 
mainstream American audiences.

Today’s television has become ever­
more polluted with cartoons that were 
created in the boardrooms of toy manu­
facturers who felt that commercials were 
not enough to reach today’s market. 
Television’s glory days of clever anima­
tion have given way to a splatter of mass- 
produced, choppy, mutant “animated 
cartoons.” And even a trip to the theater 
to watch that certain famed and framed 
rabbit is about as pleasant as drinking a 
glass of concentrated orange juice with­
out adding any water.
For those in search of some of the best 
animation around, there’s The Third 
Animation Celebration, which is cur­
rently playing at the Pittsburgh Play­
house until February 7. The Third Ani­
mation Celebration certainly isn’t some 
Saturday morning lineup, but then again, 
quality animation never is.
This is not a bunch of cartoons, but 
animation in all of its forms. Among the 
devices used were computer-animated 
images, clay animation, and illustrations 
that go well beyond ink layouts. Just as 
diverse as the methods were the artists 
themselves. The Third Animation Cel­
ebration includes works from artists of 
nine nations, includingthe Soviet Union, 
Hungary, Italy, and Switzerland.
The presentation opens up with “The 
Animated Star-SpangledBanner,” which 
is appropriate under the circumstances.
' ''' iBT iB8Sp Ct8aCi8:t 4TG•
T3SCi8:tn Twenty new animations from 
around the world.
It’s a one-and-a-half minute rendition of 
the national anthem sung by the fifth- 
graders of a school in Rochester. The 
animation itself is a charming visual 
play with the words of the anthem, and 
brings about a nice flavor of innocence, 
backed up by the children’s voices.
The Celebration moves on from there 
to a fascinating variety of works, sure to 
please everybody. There’s even an ani­
mated selection set to the music of 
“Istanbul,” from They Might Be Giants. 
This one may have been a bit much, as 
one gets the feeling that someone put 
Pee Wee Herman on speed and let him 
loose. At least the music was good.
Several of the films added some clever 
wit to their remarkable visual displays. 
There’s the computer-animated “Lava 
Jr.,” in which a lava lamp gets its just 
revenge on a smaller, pestering lamp. 
And sarcasm abounds in Bill Plympton’s 
“Wiseman,” which ridicules the supposed 
wisdom of gurus, soothsayers, and any 
other sources of sacred truths. There’s 
even a health warning in “Fumo” that is 
more eloquent and concise than any ad­
monishment by the Surgeon General.
If these don’t give one enough to think
about, there are some even more thought- 
provoking works such as “Mr. Tao.” This 
Italian film depicts a man whose search 
surpasses the mountain he’s climbing, 
and even a God-like figure he meets in 
the clouds.
Of course, The Third Animation Cel­
ebration has a few conventionally created 
cartoons in its colorful collection. “Ren 
Hoek and Stimpy” is a hilarious cartoon 
about a dog and cat’s trip to the pound. 
This marvellous bit of animation is more 
colorful and looney than anything that 
can be found on afternoon or Saturday 
morning television.
There may be a few times when the 
viewer might wish enough already, or 
wonder just why they are watching what 
they’re watching. But this is a celebra­
tion. It’s a celebration of the limitless 
world of creativity that exists in anima­
tion. It’s a celebration of the fact that 
there exists out there, in the animated 
world, a lot more than just an abused 
exclamation of “cowabunga, dude!” It’s a 
celebration of all of the life that can be 
expressed through a chunk of moving 
clay, or a computer-generated image. 
And that’s much more than one can say 
for a smurf.

First, think of all the cliché 
chase scenes you’ve ever seen in 
the movies. Got them all in your 
head? Great. Now sort out all the 
good ones. Next, sort out all the 
mediocre ones. And, when you’re 
finished with the mediocre ones, 
sort out any of the chase scenes 
that have even an ounce of origi­
nality or logic contained in them. 
What you should now have roam­
ing around in your head are a 
whole bunch of really bad cliché 
chase scenes.
Okay, put them all together and 
don’t worry about their order, and 
what do you have? A really bad 
movie filled with lots of chase 
scenes? Bingo! And believe it or 
not, not only does a film like this 
actually exist, but it even has a 
cliché name to go along with the 
rest of the package. The film, you 
ask? It’s called Run.
What started out as a good con­
center an entire movie
— Movie Review —
' SDtn A Harvard Law School stu­
dent gets himself into a sticky 
situation and has to run for his life. 
Starring Patrick Dempsey and Kelly 
Preston.
around one guy being chased — 
has been turned into an abysmal 
movie. In matter of fact, this film’s 
plot is so simple that the title 
gives too much away.
Charlie Farrow (Patrick 
Dempsey) is a Harvard Law 
School student who likes to 
gamble and works as a car me­
chanic on the side. One day, his 
boss asks him whether or not he 
would be interested in driving a 
brand new Porsche down to At­
lantic City for $200. Would any 
college student say “no” to an of­
fer like this?
So off to Atlantic City Dempsey 
goes, only to have the Porsche 
conk out on him in some mythical
medium-sized city lying some­
where between Boston and At­
lantic City. It’s going to take a few 
hours to fix the car, so Dempsey 
decides to kill some time and take 
a look around the town. Next thing 
you know, he’s inside an illegal 
gambling hall, flirting with girls 
and winning hundreds of dollars. 
He’s on top of the world, except for 
the small fact that he’s winning 
his money from the casino owner’s 
son/town psychopath.
Before you can utter the phrase 
“I can see this coming a mile 
away,” the son/psychopath is 
dead, Dempsey is blamed (even 
though everyone knows he didn’t 
do it), and for the next hour or so 
we get to watch the entire city 
chase after him.
Movies with plots like this have 
been around for ages. Take, for 
example, Die Hard, The Hidden, 
F/X, or just about any James 
Bond movie. What made these 
films work was good acting, com­
plex subplots, great special effects, 
and nail-biting suspense, even

though you just knew that the hero 
would somehow come out alive. 
This is where Run’s main prob­
lem lies — it has none of these 
elements.
The chase scenes are boring and 
predictable, the film regularly 
defies all sense of logic, people die 
left and right without the viewer 
caring much, the small attempts 
at humor are flat, all the charac­
ters are frighteningly one-dimen-
sional, the leading lady (Kelly 
Preston) is brushed aside so 
quickly it makes one wonder if 
she was even needed, and the film 
ends abruptly without explain­
ing the final outcome.
There is one brief moment which 
stands out. In this scene a police 
car falls from the top of a parking 
garage and lands upside down. 
Luckily enough,, this scene is 
usually shown as a clip during
the talk shows, so you can see it 
without having to watch the en­
tire film. Other than this one part, 
the rest of the movie is easily 
forgettable.
So take my advice and don’t 
waste your money on this movie. 
Or take the advice of the film 
makers who appropriately titled 
this movie Run. Run as far away 
as you can from this boring, pre­
dictable movie.

See the war through Joe Bob’s eyes
On the first day of the war, a 
whole bunch of billion-dollar air­
planes went up and dropped heat- 
seeking laser-guided triple-zebra- 
strength exploding “Iraqi 
Squashers” on 10,000 buildings, 
airfields and suspicious desert 
sand lizards.
The Air Force guys did a great 
job, but I’ve never heard so much 
babblin in my life. The American 
media went nutzoid. Their eyes 
were bugged out. Their voices 
were pitched higher than Sally 
Struthers on helium. Wolf Blitzer 
became America’s favorite cigar- 
store Indian. There was ten 
thousand hours of TV commen­
tary that day.
And Saddam Hussein didn’t do 
diddly.
On the second day of the war, 
37,000 airplanes went back up in 
the sky and bounced 14 billion 
tons of Aunt Jemim a p ancake mix 
on the 10,000 targets they forgot 
to-flatten the first day.
•This time, Iraq fired eight piti­
ful missiles at Israel.
And there was twenty thousand 
hours of TV commentary. 
“Oooooooo! Israel! Whoa!” Hour 
after hour we listened to this: 
“Israel! They hit Israel!”
On the third day of the war, we 
started capturing prisoners, 
shootin down Iraqi fighters that 
were stupid enough to go up 
against our Lizard-Tail Nuclear 
Gil'a-Monster Lethal-Leopard 
Face-Scramblers, and the 
weather was bad and so we only 
flew twenty-five thousand mis­
sions and turned most of the Iraqi 
air defense system into scrap 
metal.
This time, Iraq managed to get 
off three more missiles at Israel 
and two at Saudi Arabia, and we’re 
not'completely sure about the ones 
in; Saudi Arabia. And again the
JOE BOB GOES TO 
THE DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
media went “Ooooooooo! Power­
ful Scud missiles, bouncing into 
Saudi Arabia like goony birds!” 
And they stayed on the air the 
entire weekend, inventing things 
to talk about like whether or not 
the Super Bowl should be can­
celled.
And then every day of the war 
since then, the same dang thing 
happens. It’s like watching a foot­
ball game where our side scores 
150 points by halftime, then the 
other side tries to kick one field 
goal, but they miss. So it’s 150 to 
nothin, but the announcer keeps 
saying “We gotta be careful about 
this comeback attempt. They al­
most got that field goal, and then 
it would have been 150 to 3 and 
we’d have something to worry 
about.”
“Oooooooooo! Saddam Hussein 
set fire to some oil wells! Let’s see 
what that means. Mr. General, 
sir, what does that mean?”
“No military significance what­
soever.”
“Let’s ask this general over here. 
Mr. General, sir, what does the 
burning of oil wells mean to this 
war?”
“No military significance 
whatsoever.”
“Let’s ask this professor of 
military studies and chiropractic 
technique at Southwest Missis­
sippi State College for Fanners.
Professor, what does it mean when 
they bum the oil wells?”
“What it could mean is that 
they’re trying to bum a hole in 
the ozone layer and create per­
petual winter over Kuwait.” 
“Well, there you have it! Saddam 
Hussein has called in his crack 
Iraqi environmental engineers 
and figured out a plan for global 
cooling!”
You know what I’m talking 
about here?
I can only explain this one way. 
The only people that want this 
war to go on are the reporters.
So let me sum it up for you guys: 
The allied forces are pasting 
the man’s butt. The man has al­
ready lost. It might take us a 
while to march all the artillery 
into Kuwait and mop up his mess, 
but it’s over. There’s not enough 
time left in the game to make up 
150 points. His starting quarter­
back is out with a broken brain. 
Nothingin his game plan worked. 
At least when Pat Sumrall says, 
“It’s gonna be tough for the 
Raiders to make up a 27-point 
deficit, but there’s plenty of time 
left.” — at least when he says it, 
we know it’s because he works for 
a network that doesn’t want you 
to turn the game off.
We would like to turn this game 
off quickly. If possible, we’d like 
the other team to go home at half- 
time.
Is this clear? These guys have 
families back over here the states, 
and they do not need to be hearing 
every five minutes how the big 
Iraqi counter-offensive is coming 
down any minute now.
Tall stop it. Saddam Hussein 
watches TV, too. When CNN says 
he has a chance, he believes he has 
a chance.
The downed pilots and their 
families would appreciate it if you
guys would get real.
Speaking of men in uniform, 
Caged Fury disappeared for lack 
of business right after it came 
out, but it might be the finest 
bimbos-in-cages movie since the 
early seventies. Roxanna 
Michaels is the nubile young blond 
girl who shows up in Hollywood 
one day trying to be an actress, 
and you know the rest: proposi­
tioned by a sleazeball photogra­
pher, abducted from a rock-and- 
roll club, knocked around by bik­
ers, taken home by a kung fu 
mercenary, kissed by Erik 
Estrada, ordered to take off her 
blouse at the “talent agency,” and
— most horrible of all — ordered 
to do a love scene with Jack Carter. 
When she refuses, she’s arrested, 
tried, and sentenced to a year in 
women’s prison. And this is only 
her third day in El Lay.
Yes, how many times has it 
happened, in just the same sad 
way, to how many young aspiring 
starlets?
Next, meet the sadistic guards, 
the lesbian warden, the friendly 
members of “your personal parole 
board,” and you can see we have 
all the ingredients for classic 
bimbos-behind-bars. They’re tor­
tured, they’re abused, they’re 
hosed down, and then, of course, 
they exact their revenge on the 
brutal male culture that has 
turned them into helpless caged 
victims dressed in standard 
Frederick’s of Hollywood prison 
garb.
Will Erik Estrada liberate our 
girls?
Will they be forced to kiss Jack 
Carter on the lips?
Some things are too horrible to 
even talk about.

It’s not easy being green
We here at The Tartan will stop 
at nothing to bring you the inside 
stoop on matters of great impor­
tance. This week, in an ultra­
secret rendezvous that would put 
Woodward and Bernstein to 
shame, this old reporter got his 
greasy hands on the psychiatric 
file of one Dr. Bruce Banner, a.k.a 
the Incredible Hulk! Isn’t that 
illegal? Isn’t that confidential in­
formation? Dost thou have no 
morals, ye say!? Heck no!
Be warned, dear reader, once 
you start reading the tragic tale 
of our boy Banner, you may cry so 
long you’ll drown in your own 
tears! Sniff!
But first, in order to better un­
derstand the man behind the 
nionster, it would be wise to dis­
pel any thoughts you might be 
harboring relating to that hokey 
fictional TV show that aired a few 
years back. Hey, Reliefophiles, 
this is the story behind the story, 
the whole truth and nothin’ but, 
that you’re about to hear.
; A long time ago, in the middle of 
a-lonely desert, under a shelter­
ing sky, there was a brilliant sci­
entist named Bruce Banner who
COMIC RELIEF
by Waseem Hussain
found himself trapped meters 
away from ground zero of a 
Gamma Bomb explosion. Ironic, I 
think, that the man who created 
this weapon of mass destruction 
should suffer at its glowing, 
gamma-soaked hands. This meek 
scientist who incurred the wrath 
of God Himself survived the ex­
plosion and found himself changed 
... forever!.
The changed Bruce Banner, 
whenever angered, transformed 
into another man. A big, ugly, 
unkempt green man with the 
brain of a five year old, who lashed 
out violently at whatever opposed 
him. The angrier he got, the 
stronger he got, and for years this 
Jekyll and Hyde, whose motto, 
“Hulk Smash,” echoed endlessly
in the canyons of the Grand, wan­
dered America and the world.
After years of mindless exist­
ence'this Hulk thing, this man- 
hoss, began to evolve. For a sus­
tained period of months the intel­
lect of Bruce Banner controlled 
the Hulk. Gone forever was the 
temperamental man-child; in his 
place stood a controlled force for 
good. Hallelujah! Ah, but for Dr. 
Bruce there are no happy endings 
and his peace of a few months 
evaporated. Banner lost control, 
had a nervous breakdown and 
committed mental suicide of sorts.
Oh, how the world was shocked 
at this tragic turn of events. Yes, 
dear reader, you may take this 
moment to wipe that tear welling 
up in your sore eyes.
But this was only the beginning 
of the tragedy, for now in the 
place of Banner stood a Hulk 
different from any the world had 
ever seen. Over the steely land­
scape of the city howled a mind­
less creature of hate whose only 
purpose was to smoosh things. 
The world could not survive such 
a threat, so the ferocious, emer­
ald animal was banished from
this plane of existence. Formonths 
the savage wandered his new di­
mension, searching for peace but 
finding only more of the death 
and deceit that had led to its cre­
ation.
Months later, the creature 
emerged in America and was 
quickly captured and detained. A 
procedure was performed which 
would physically separate the 
Hulk and the recently revived 
Bruce Banner into two separate 
entities. In the months that fol­
lowed, Banner got married and 
started to live a normal life.
But, alas, comic fans, this peace 
was short-lived as well. The 
separation of Banner and the 
Hulk was killing them both and a 
fusion of the two halves was nec­
essary again.
It was this fusion which resulted 
in perhaps the most interesting of 
all the forms the Hulk had ever 
taken on. As ifin direct opposition 
to the years the Hulk spent as a 
raging child, the beast now 
emerged a cunning, shrewd, in­
telligent Hulk. And he’d traded 
his green skin for grey skin to 
boot.
The Incredible Hulk does what he
This was a grey Hulk of charac­
ter and depth, whose new color 
was far more symbolic then aes­
thetic. All of a sudden folks started 
to wonder; who was the man and 
who was the monster?
This history of the Hulk which 
I’ve presented should bring you 
up to date on what’s happened to 
Bruce Banner in the last few 
years. But it was the recent meet­
ing between Bruce Banner and 
longtime psychiatrist/pal Leonard

Another CFA musical means another new director
| By TERRI KASCH
I Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
¦Another musical is in rehearsal over at 
CFA, and with it comes another switch 
fif 'directors. Last fall, director John 
DeLuca was recruited to take over A 
CJiorus Line. Now, director Brian Kulick 
[ has taken on the job as director of the 
Stephen Sondheim musical Into The 
Woods, filling in for Mel Shapiro. Ac­
cording to Kulick, Shapiro has taken a 
year off to run the drama program at 
UCLA.
Kulick, a 1985 CFA graduate, would 
not normally find the task of taking over 
for another director especially challeng­
ing. but “It’s [difficult] when you’re fill­
ing in for Mel,” said Kulick, “because I 
'think he’s an extraordinary director.” 
While in college Kulick studied under 
¡Shapiro. “When I got out of school and I 
jvould start doing shows, I would always

INTO THE WOODS. Little Red Riding Hood, The Big Bad Wolf, Jack and the Beanstalk, 
Cinderella and many other popular fairy tale characters come together in Stephen 
Sondheim’s Broadway musical Into The Woods. Starring Ashley Cruz, Willard Crosby, 
Jeffrey Kubiatowicz, and Steven Prince. At Kresge Theatre February 7-23. Call x2407 for 
ticket information.
think ‘Well, what would Mel do in a case 
like this?’ ... and now, suddenly, I’m 
doing one of his shows thinking ‘What 
would he really do?’ ”
Even though Kulick was personally 
offered tickets by James Lapine, the 
Broadway director of Into The Woods, he 
never made it over to see the show. Kulick 
now sees this as an advantage “because 
then you have to sort of build it yourself 
which is always a fun thing to do.... I 
think it’s more difficult when you see 
something [first] because then you have
that in your head.”
This is not Kulick’s first return visit to 
CFA; he took part in a summer program 
here. Although he has worked with sev­
eral different groups across the country, 
Kulick still finds working with students 
to be a special experience. “Everything 
outside of the university seems to be very 
ad hoc,” expressed Kulick. “People will 
be pulled from all over and assembled 
and they don’t have the same acting 
training, they don’t have the same sensi­
bilities. And here you have this wonder­
ful opportunity of having a chance to 
Work with a group of students who have 
spent four years together in the same 
room. So, there’s an immediate trust 
among them, and sense of play and com­
munication that would take a much 
longer period of time to achieve outside.” 
Kulick spends most of his time directing 
classical dramas and opera, so Into The 
Woods is something of a change for him, 
but not as much as one might think. 
“What I think Sondheim has done is to be 
one of the forerunners of moving musical 
theater to music theater. I think there’s 
a big difference. I think it has to do with 
a kind of expression that is not as for­
mulated as, say, Rogers and 
Hammerstein.... The songs aren’t just 
tunes,” Kulick stated. “I think with 
Sondheim you’re dealing with a pretty 
amazing phenomenon in that he’s a great 
dramatist, he’s not just a lyricist.”
Into The Woods combines characters
from many different fairy tales into K,zk 
story. Little Red Riding Hood mixes witfc . 
Rapunzel, Jack and his Beanstalk, an(i . 
others, all of whom reside in and around, 
the same forest.
When Into The Woods hit Broadway in-., 
1988 it receiving mixed reviews from 
critics and audiences. Still, the combi­
nation of Sondheim’s ear for music and 
Lapine’s inspired direction won many 
people over and the musical made off 
with several Tony award nominations.
As opening night for Into The Woods 
approaches, the director is experiencing 
some anxiety, but he’s used to it, and he’s 
found a way to handle it. “Oh, I’m always 
nervous, it doesn’t matter when, but I 
smoke a lot.”
Into The Woods begins previews onj 
February 7 and opens February 9. Per­
formances will continue until February

Remastered Led Zeppelin would make Bonham proud
— Record Review —
*??? LED ZEPPELIN (BOXED
SET). By Led Zeppelin, Atlantic 
Records.
By MIKE SHAPIRO
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
It’s sort of silly to give Led Zep­
pelin more than a perfunctory 
introduction. If you live even on 
the periphery of Western Civili­
zation you’ve heard their music 
on countless radio stations, on 
television specials, on movie 
soundtracks, and blasting from 
open dorm windows on Friday 
nights.
If there’s one cliché that pole- 
vaults to mind when one looks at 
a compilation like the Led Zeppe­
lin boxed set, it’s that “they don’t 
make ’em like they used to.” And 
indeed, they don’t. Like the 
Beatles, Zeppelin created one of 
the most pervasive group images 
in rock and roll, but used it as 
garnish for their music, not as a 
substitute.
Flip on MTV for five minutes, 
and chances are that whatever 
they show between the alternat- 
mg Vanilla Ice videos will be some 
arborially-haired pseudo-metal 
Zeppelin imitator, mechanically 
groping for some stylistic rem­
nant of the group in hopes of 
tapping into a sort of deserved 
success that’s so alien in music 
today.
Not that one can really blame 
them. How many groups can re­
peat a seven-note guitar hook for 
eight minutes and not send you 
into a coma? Who else but Robert 
Plant could shriek into a mie as if 
an anvil had been dropped on his 
foot and have it sound musical? 
Would Milli Vanilli have sham­
med their transient way to success 
With just one released single over 
the space of thirteen years?
John Bonham's thundering percussion 
has never sounded more powerful, 
although he can't appreciate it since 
he's dead.
tunes for the rest of your natural; 
life, if not longer. If you don’t like; 
them, too bad — you will, by force; 
of exposure. You might as well 
buy the compilation now, before, 
they re-release the material on 
hologram or something and de-; 
mand the rest of your bank ac-; 
count for the courtesy.
Thus, the only real question that 
arises when you walk out of Na­
tional Record Mart with the qua- 
druple-disc Led Zeppelin boxed 
set under your arm is why you 
just parted with a week’s wages 
for a compilation when you al­
ready have all ten albums neatly 
stacked on your bookshelf back 
home. And indeed, you might be 
confused at first, but as you recline 
in Kiltie Court admiring your 
purchase and wishing you could 
afford dinner, your subconscious 
reasoning will start to emerge 
from the haze of consumptive 
spontaneity.
First of all, you get lots and lots 
and lots of Led Zeppelin music. 
Everything by the group that 
you’ve ever heard on popular 
media has come back with a 
vengeance, and is just as ener­
getic and innovative as the origi­
nal releases. Not surprising, since 
they’re the same exact songs.
However, they have been digi­
tally remastered, and desensi­
courtesy Atlantic Records
tized as we may have become to 
this buzz phrase of the recording 
industry, Led Zeppelin really lets 
you appreciate how music tech­
nology has advanced in the last 
two decades.
The songs are frighteningly 
clean, particularly in the lower 
registers. Listening to disc two 
for a while, you realize that the 
blurry thumping in.“Immigrant 
Song” is in fact a bass guitar, 
rather than whale mating calls. 
John Bonham’s thundering per­
cussion has never sounded more 
powerful, although he can’t ap­
preciate it since he’s dead. Robert 
Plant’s voice—well, it still sounds 
like an agonized caterwaul, but 
at least it sounds like a clear 
agonized caterwaul, and you can 
even make out the snatch of a 
lyric here and there.
You also get the token previ­
ously unreleased material that’s 
presumably intended to prompt 
you into buying the album on the 
premise that you’re getting some­
thing new. Unfortunately, the 
stuff is so good that the tactic 
works. “Travelling Riverside 
Blues,” a cover of a Robert John­
son classic, is head-bobbingly 
addictive. “Hey, Hey, What Can I 
Do” is a pleasant smattering of 
classic rock that rode the B-Side 
of the “Immigrant Song” single 
way back when. And there’s also 
“White Summer/Black Mountain 
Side,” a wandering acoustic 
number originally done for a BBC 
radio show.
As is obligatory for something 
so obscenely expensive, the Zep­
pelin boxed set includes a mon­
strous liner pamphlet with vin­
tage photos and essays by the 
likes of Kurt Loder and Robert 
Palmer. The full-color blowups 
are fine for nostalgic purposes, 
but in all honesty, these guys were 
sweaty and grease-encrusted 
most of the time, however theat­
rical the context. What you’re re­
ally going to spend the free time 
your newly-acquired poverty af­
fords you is listening to the music 
itself.
And, as said, it’s all there. An­
cient Zeppelin classics like “Whole 
Lotta Love” and “Heartbreaker” 
make you wish you were sentient 
enough to buy albums in 1969. 
Eerie, orchestrated Phrygian 
pieces like “Kashmir” and 
“Friends” make you scamper for a 
stuffed animal. Frenziedjams like 
“Trampled Underfoot” will have 
you screaming along with Robert 
Plant, and probably make you 
tear your vocal chords in the 
process. And, of course, there’s 
the undisputed number one song
in rock history, “Stairway to 
Heaven.”
Led Zeppelin is one of those 
groups whose music just won’t go 
away, and justifiably so, consid­
ering the kind of talentless nau­
sea the last decade has tried to 
provide us in their wake. But more 
importantly, there’s a sort of in­
imitable vigor in their songs, a 
raw, secular lust for life that — 
forgive me — Janet Jackson and 
Poison simply do not provide.
This is great stuff. Chances are 
that you’re going to hear these

Television theme songs can make or break a show
Take a minute. Think of your 
favorite shows. Now, ask yourself
— why do you like them? Is it the 
superior writing, the superb 
characterizations, marvelous 
acting, or just all-around high 
quality? Nah. When you think of 
a show, what’s the first thing that 
comes to mind? That’s right: the 
theme song.
Theme songs can make or break 
a show. What would The Brady 
Bunch be without the “Brady 
Bunch song?“ Addams Family 
aficionados will tell you that the 
theme song makes the difference 
between their show and The 
Munsters. And just think what a 
memorable show Good Grief 
might be if it only had a catchy 
-intro.
Don’t scoff — theme songs are 
pretty important. So important, 
in fact, that I’m dedicating this 
week’s column to them. Our cul­
ture is one that is obsessed with 
•grouping things, so I have grouped 
TV theme songs into approxi­
mately four major categories.

theme songs—the ones that have 
been known to drive people crazy. 
I can just imagine a person sitting 
in a padded room in a straitjacket 
singing the Gilligan’s Island 
theme song over and over and 
over again.
These songs also have the ability 
to make a bad show seem good, or 
a forgettable show memorable. 
Mister Ed (“a horse is a horse...”), 
Green Acres (“... is the place to 
be”), Laverne & Shirley (“we’re
gonna do it...”), and the list goes 
on and on.
Instrumentals
These can be addictive too. 
Think about it: how many of these 
do you know? I Dream ofJeannie, 
Bewitched, Get Smart, L.A. Law, 
Doogie Howser, Miami Vice, Dal­
las, Andy Griffith Show, St. 
Elsewhere, Night Court, Barney 
Miller, Mork and Mindy, Dick Van 
Dyke Show, Newhart, Alfred 
Hitchcock Presents, ALF, Star 
Trek, Twin Peaks. Surprising how 
much trivial information is float­
ing around in your head, isn’t it?
There’s an entire “Mike Post­
type” sub-category. This is the 
guy who wrote the theme songs to 
Rockford Files, Magnum P.I., 
Quantum Leap, and others. He 
and his disciples are responsible 
for countless action-adventure 
theme songs (The A-Team, Rip­
tide, Knight Rider, Simon & 
Simon). The trouble is that they 
all tend to blend together in one’s 
mind, but then, so do the shows.
Sickly sweet
Almost any family show cur­
rently on the air has or had one of 
these. A smarmy poppy voice sings 
really lame or excessively cute 
lyrics as viewers grimace. These 
are the worst because they stick 
to your mind like a wad of bubble 
gum to your shoe. Who’s the Boss 
is a good example. Come on, you 
know it: “A brand new life, a brand 
new life around the bend.” Makes 
you seriously question your use­
fulness, doesn’t it?
This seems to have been largely 
an early eighties phenomenon, 
though. Silver Spoons, Diffrent 
Strokes, Webster, The Hogan 
Family. Remember the romantic 
duets of Family Ties and Growing 
Pains? Growing Pains has 
changed to a pretty cool a cappella 
version, though. Which brings us 
to the next category ...
Changes
As shows get older, they get 
boring. They need something to
keep their image new and excit­
ing. Why not change the theme 
song, or atleastjazzitup?Casein 
point: The Facts of Life. When this 
classic first premiered in 1980, 
we heard Charlotte Rae’s war­
bling falsetto over the opening 
credits. By the time the show left 
the air in 1988, Rae was gone, and 
the theme song, though still the 
same, was sung by a male rock 
group and opened with a guitar 
riff.
Our favorite, Charles in Charge, 
underwent a similar transforma­
tion. Originally, an innocent fe­
male voice sang the introduction. 
Now the voices are plural, more 
detached, almost inhuman. But I 
guess that makes sense in light of 
recent revelations.
Of course, The Cosby Show has 
never had the same theme song 
for more than one season. In this 
case, the theme song is memo­
rable because it changes. Go fig­
ure.
There seem to be bigger changes 
underway, though. Several recent 
shows have had theme songs that
are definitely not hummable; take 
Roseanne and the new series 
Davis Rules, for example. Or the 
characters talk right over the 
theme song, down-playing or 
completely obliterating it: Parker 
Lewis Can’t Lose, Kate & Allle 
Murphy Brown.
What does this recent develop­
ment mean? Maybe the theme 
song is quickly becoming part$f 
the past, something we’ll te],l our 
kids about. “Believe it or not, Joey, 
before the show started, they 
would play a songY’
But I don’t buy it. As long as 
there are mediocre shows,-there 
will be theme songs. You know 
what they say: you take the good, 
you take the bad, beans don’t burn 
in the kitchen, but as long &s 
we’ve got each other, we’re t\vo 
silver spoons together, you and I
— thank you for being a friend. 
(And cousins are two of a kind?)

Two CFA Alumni attempt to explore Columbus through theatre
By J. GRELLO-MAKXUACH
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
1992 will herald the five-hundredth 
anniversary of the discovery of the New 
World by Christopher Columbus. Al­
though any grade-school student can re­
late the story of how Columbus, the great 
visionary, struggled to prove that the 
Earth is round, the truth behind the 
myth is far more complex than that. 
Because of a shared belief that “the 
identity of a community is based on its 
history,” CMU alumni Roxana Avila and 
David Korish have set out to explore how 
history and mythology weave together to 
create a tapestry that is ultimately both 
arid neither.
Avila and Korish, both of whom hold 
MFAs from Carnegie Mellon’s College of 
Fine Arts, are the originators of a theat­
rical project simply titled Discovery. In 
order to bring the interplay of history 
and fiction to life, Avila and Korish hope 
to mobilize an international community 
of writers, directors and performers from 
the fields of dance, film, video and the 
theater toward the creation of a multi- 
media, multicultural piece which prom­
ises to be as unconventional as it is 
diverse.
The aim of Discovery, to piece together 
narratives of discovery, conquest, and 
colonization, will be evident from the 
first moments of the production, in which 
audience members entering the theater 
will be asked by reporters armed with 
video cameras to relate their impres­
sions of the discovery of the New World. 
These impressions, in turn, will be played 
in televisions inside the performance 
space, making the audience active par­
ticipants in the work. The play proper is 
divided into three sections — Discovery, 
Conquest, and Colonization.
The aim of the first section is to jux­
tapose the legend of the discovery of the 
New World with what Avila calls “the 
maze of intellectual knowledge” which 
pertains to the period of the discovery. 
The first section of the piece will be 
divided into two subsections, the first of
which will use experimental, fragmen­
tary techniques, eschewing theatrical 
convention in order to present the laby­
rinth of historical thought, opinion, and 
confusion which has been accepted or 
subverted in order to make up the truth 
as it has been widely accepted.
Without the use of narrative form, this 
movement will interlace the depiction of 
such imaginary conflicts as the meeting 
of legendary figures, such as Columbus 
and Oedipus, with the presentation of 
historical data. As an example, Avila 
presents the argument that “the world 
was known to be round before Columbus; 
the skepticism surrounding the voyage 
centered upon the belief that Columbus 
would starve to death. Columbus believed 
that sailing around the world was a pos­
sibility because his calculations were off 
by 25 percent; had the New World not 
been on his way, the voyage would have 
failed.” This fragmentary presentation 
of fact, fiction and fancy will be 
counterpointed by a “classical” one-act 
play commissioned from playwright 
Simon Black expressly for Discovery. The 
play tells the story of Columbus, “the 
man, his dream, and the quest to prove 
the world is round” as it has been ab­
sorbed into the mainstream culture.
The second section of Discovery relates 
the story of the conquest of the New 
World, relying on movement and dance 
to relate a story of spiritual, physical and 
ethical collisions. The choice of a move­
ment piece was made in part because its 
abstraction will help to eliminate the 
clichés (such as that of “the noble savage,” 
and “the evil Spaniards”) which com­
monly accompany stories depicting the 
clash of cultures. In Avila’s words, the 
second section of the play intends to 
show the “passion, bloodshed, and bar­
barism that is conquest,” showing how a 
highly advanced culture could be obliter­
ated because it was disadvantaged by 
having taken a different pattern of social 
evolution than that of the conquistadors. 
As an example, Avila presents the case of 
Pizarro, who “was illiterate and had been 
a pig breeder before turning conquista-
By bringing such diversity to the theme of the 
discovery of the New World, Avila and Korish 
hope to provoke questions about the myth of 
Columbus, thus creating a vision of Latin 
American culture as multi-layered, the prod­
uct of a complex sequence of events which 
was neither black nor white.
dor, but was able to conquer an empire 
because it had not developed metal or 
firearms.” The second movement will be 
swift and concise, not only to serve as a 
bridge between the first and final sections 
of the play, but to mirror the overpow­
ering force of the Spanish conquest.
Discovery concludes on a far more up­
beat, but equally polemical note. The 
final movement of the piece, Colonization, 
will be represented, quite literally, as 
the union of the cultures which went into 
the making of the New World. In this 
section, the marriage of the cultures will 
be presented as “a huge wedding with all 
the trimmings.” Although the ceremony 
will be patterned after the traditional 
Roman Catholic wedding, signifying the 
influence of Catholicism in the coloniza­
tion, the proceedings will be further 
complicated by the presence of African, 
Jewish, Moorish and a host of other 
cultures which have influenced the de­
velopment of Latin America. “The bride,” 
as described by Avila,“ will be played by 
a huge puppet, and the groom will have 
several men inside one costume, the 
different heads depicting different 
strands of cultural identity.”
In addition to the presence of multi­
cultural influences, this sequence will 
continue to pursue the established ar­
guments about Columbus and the man­
ner in which he has been mythologized. 
Instead of the stations of the Via Crucis, 
the church set will feature stations de­
picting the life of Columbus. By bringing
such diversity to the theme of the dis­
covery of the New World, Avila and Korish 
hope to provoke questions about the myth 
of Columbus, thus creating a vision of 
Latin American culture as multi-layered, 
the product of a complex sequence of 
events which was neither black nor white. 
Ultimately, the images presented in the 
piece will bring into focus the current 
power relations between Latin America 
and the rest of the world.
But Discovery aims to be more than a 
pluralist statement of culture and his­
tory. In mounting this production, Avila 
and Korish hope to present what she 
terms “a spectacle, a comedy” in an envi­
ronment patterned after “a Latin 
American fiesta,” in which the participa­
tion and emotional, physical, and intel­
lectual involvement of the audience will 
be as important as the proceedings on 
stage.
In order to bring their ideas to reality, 
Avila and Korish have enlisted the aid of 
American and international members of 
the Carnegie Mellon community. The 
pool of writers, directors and performers 
involved in the show include CFA stu­
dents and alumni, including playwright 
Tammy Ryan (who is writing the sermon 
for the wedding ceremony), directors Dina 
Amin, Lisa Alter, and H&SS graduate 
and Watson Fellow Bob Cucuzza. Avila 
herself is a Costa Rican national who 
studied at Carnegie Mellon under a 
Fulbright Scholarship, and Korish will 
spend 1991 in Costa Rica, teaching and
directing under a Fulbright Scholarship.
Although Pittsburgh is currently the 
base of operations for Discovery, Avila and 
Korish intend to mount the productibn 
in San Jose, Costa Rica, between Sep­
tember and October of 1991. Costa.Rica 
was chosen for what Avila describes as 
its “centrality and neutrality,” as well'as 
for economic reasons. The production, 
which Avila humorously describes as1“a 
gigantic monster,” is expected to take Jip 
a space much larger and less specialized 
than a conventional theater. Currently 
the producers are looking at spaces ¡as 
diverse as a warehouse, an abandoned 
jail, and even the building whicli once 
housed the Costa Rican National Liquor 
factory.
Upon completion, Avila and Korish 
hope to take the production to ptfter 
nations, using creative input from art­
ists of all of the nations the production 
visits. Ultimately, they hope to bring 
Discovery back to America in conjunc­
tion with the many artistic festivals 
scheduled to commemorate Columbus’s 
voyage.
If Discovery is a success, Avila and 
Korish hope that it will be the first in a 
series of steps leading to the creation of 
an international institute (or an “anti- 
company” as Avila describes it) in which 
performers, directors and actors of dif­
ferent nationalities will put their skills 
toward the production of innovative 
works of theatre. Considering the possi­
bilities for learning and achievement af­
forded by a production such as Discovery, 
one can only hope that the realization of 
this goal is inevitable.

It’s not easy being the Incredible Hulk
HULK, from page Lll
you’re raw. An opportunistic 
gentle breeze, fueled by the fires 
of paradise lost, stabs mercilessly 
into your vulnerable flesh, dig­
ging deep until it hollows you out. 
Whatever is left of your heart 
bleeds through your pores and 
forms screaming puddles that 
torture you at night.
This is the kind of pain Brace 
Banner must have felt after his 
father had finished beating him 
and his mother. Finally, the hate 
took his mother to the grave. 
When she died, the boy’s pain 
turned into an ugly tumor that 
began to secrete a poisonous bile 
into his soul. Banner grew up a 
repressed child, afraid to feel 
anything for fear of getting hurt. 
He grew up a tormented child 
who shackled his feelings of an­
ger and helplessness towards a 
truly demented father.
When Banner grew up the an­
ger he felt towards his father 
snowballed into a general distrust 
of other people, including himself. 
Now Bruce hid himself under the
secure blanket of emotionless sci­
ence; in this realm he was invul­
nerable. While Banner went 
through the motions of life, his 
heart was safe, yet imprisoned. 
The years of repression caused a 
Teflon casing to form around 
Bruce’s heart. All emotions and 
feelings of pain and hunger would 
slide off the Teflon heart and dis­
sipate. The Teflon cage was suffo­
cating Banner’s soul. It cried for 
liberation, and when that fateful 
day of the gamma bomb explosion 
came, it found freedom in the form 
of the Hulk.
Bruce Banner suffered from a 
multiple personality disorder in 
which each personality not only 
had its own character, but its own 
physical body as well. The man- 
child green Hulk of Banner’s ear­
lier years was a manifestation of 
the fire behind a repressed child. 
The conniving grey Hulk of later 
years was the repressed id of the 
adult Banner who was afraid to 
feel any emotions or act on any 
impulse.
As a result of intense therapy,
Bruce Banner has finally come to 
terms with his multiple person­
alities. The result is a new, whole 
Bruce Banner who has integrated 
aspects of all three of his person­
alities into the current incarna­
tion of the Incredible Hulk. Per­
haps Dr. Banner will now find the 
peace he has always searched for 
in his new form.
But heck, if you want to know 
what happens to our pal, you’ll 
have to pick up Marvel Comics’ 
monthly documentation of the life 
and times of the Incredible Hulk. 
The documenting is tastefully and 
intelligently done by the creative 
team of Peter David and Dale 
Keown. Certainly this is one case 
history with a long and exciting 
future!
The Incredible Hulk is pub­
lished by Marvel Comics.

Phantom of the Attic.

Cry, the Beloved Country
Over the years we have become more aware of the 
, ..environment and socially repressed people of the 
¦ world. After some time, our growing concerns were 
'¦'floticed through the various aspects of the media. The 
1951 movie, Cry, the Beloved Country was one of the 
' , first media depictions of our growing concerns about 
problems in our world.
, ... Cry, the Beloved Country is the first movie about
¦ the Apartheid policy. In this moving film, a black 
" 'South African priest learns that his son has been 
arrested for murder. With this basic plot, the issue of 
interracial conflicts is explored. The movie also shows 
the inferior living conditions endured by the blacks of 
South Africa. With stars like Sidney Poitier, the film 
has a heavy impact on the viewer. When seeing this 
"film, your brain cells will not switch into relaxed 
. ..mode as with Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure. Be 
prepared for some deep historical accounts.

Jacob’s Ladder
¦ Don’t be fooled by the first few minutes of Jacob’s 
,Ladder — this is not your normal Vietnam War flick. 
Tim Robbins plays a soldier in Vietnam by the name 
„of Jacob Singer. He is severely wounded in battle and 
» ' suddenly leaps into a new world. One wonders what 
1 "is happening to him for the remainder of the movie as

.. -his new lover who works with him at the post office, 
v ;:and a series of haunting images that leave him 
•f -baffled and terrified.
“ This is definitely a “thinking” movie, with brilliant
imagery and symbolism which might take several

; The Blues Brothers
In 1980, John Landis came out with a musical/ 
comedy/action movie starring John Belushi, Dan 
Ackroyd, Carrie Fisher, Cab Calloway, Aretha 
; .Franklin, Ray Charles, Steven Speilberg, Pee Wee 
'.I Herman, Frank Oz, John Candy, and James Brown.
1 "This movie was called The Blues Brothers and it’s 
" worth a lousy buck. It has something for everyone:
. ,ihe most expensive and elaborate car chase ever 
filmed, midwest Nazis, stupid cops, angry ex-girl- 
o „friends with rocket launchers, great music, numer­
ous cameo appearances, and of course, great lines, 
such as “Did you get my Cheese Whiz, boy?”, or “We 
have both kinds of music—country and western,” and 
of course, “I hate Indiana Nazis.”
So get in your Bluesmobile (hopefully the lighter

Ladyhawke
Based on a 13th century legend, Ladyhawke is the 
tale, of two lovers destined to be “always together, 
eternally apart.” Matthew Broderick stars as Phillipe 
‘The Mouse” Gaston, a pickpocket who meets the 
knight and lady separated by a curse. Rutger Hauer 
plays Nevar, a man who’s cursed to be human by day 
and a wolf by night. Michelle Pfeiffer is his lover 
Isabeau, cursed to be a hawk by day and human by 
night. The two lovers are allowed to share only one 
brief moment as humans as the sun rises.
Along with an old friar, the group sets off on an 
adventure to find the Bishop of Aquila, who placed 
the curse on the star-crossed couple when the lady 
refused his love. A coming eclipse may be the key to 
breaking the curse, but only if they can get to the 
bishop in time. This is a captivating film with action, 
conflict, and stunning cinematography. Don’t miss 
this movie, if only to see the breathtaking human-to- 
animal transformation scenes.

Penie? Penises? Anyone know?
Rusty —
Until you take up ‘gardening* 
yourself, I’d suggest that you leave 
the discussion of ‘tools’ and their 
implementation to the experts. In 
other words, mind your own 
business!
I love the story of The Princess 
Bride — too bad some people don’t 
really understand it. Or the 
meaning of “true love.”
Spud —
Kisses & hugs....
and anything else you can think of. 
And, yes, I do mean anything.
I love you.
Bobo
Dawn,
Why don’tryou dump that loser and 
take a chance with someone who 
can really make you purr?
