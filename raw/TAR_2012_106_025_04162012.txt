Expelled junior civil and 
environmental engineering 
major Stephane Batton is 
suing Carnegie Mellon for 
violating his civil rights.
Following Batton’s Feb. 
4 off-campus ?ght with 
another student, the uni-
versity held a disciplinary 
committee hearing. Batton 
claims the hearing violated 
his civil rights. He is suing 
to reverse the expulsion.
According to the lawsuit, 
Batton claims the univer-
sity violated his rights by 
forcing him to testify while 
criminal charges against 
him were pending, censor-
ing the questions he could 
ask witnesses, and refusing 
to provide a transcript of 
the hearing when he ap-
pealed his expulsion.
The suit names the uni-
versity, Jared Cohon, Mi-
chael Murphy, Gina Casa-
legno, and the University 
Committee on Discipline as 
defendants. Cathy Bissoon, 
U.S. district court judge, 
will preside over the case; 
no trial date has been re-
leased at this time.
Junior civil and environ-
mental engineering major 
Elissa Goldner, a friend of 
Batton, has started a peti-
tion to have him reinstated 
as a student. Goldner de-
clined to comment, pend-
ing approval from Batton’s 
lawyer.
Teresa Thomas, assistant 
vice president for media 
relations for the university, 
said in an email, “Consis-
tent with our practice, we 
will not comment on the 
substance of this pending 
lawsuit. We are con?dent 
that the University fol-
lowed appropriate process 
throughout the proceedings 
that are the subject of the 
complaint, and further that 
the plaintiff’s rights were 
not violated in any way.”
Carnegie Mellon’s com-
munity standards website 
does not explicitly address 
off-campus issues or al-
tercations, nor does it list 
a strict standard for when 
a violation of community 
standards results in expul-
sion as opposed to some 
other form of disciplinary 
action. However, assault is 
listed as an infraction that 
will result in a disciplinary 
hearing.
According to the web-
site, in cases under the Uni-
versity Committee on Dis-
cipline, “In the disciplinary 
process, a student who is 
charged with a violation has 
the right to remain silent.”
The website also ad-
dresses the question of 
whether transcripts of a 
hearing must be provided 
for an appeal: “The person 
bringing an appeal may re-
quest that the recordings of 
the hearing be transcribed. 
In this case, the student will 
be responsible for the cost 
of providing a transcription 
of the recording of the prior 
proceedings. The transcrip-
tion is made solely for the 
use of the person consider-
ing the appeal. The tran-
script will NOT be provided 
to the students involved.”
Batton had a prelimi-
nary hearing on Thursday 
regarding criminal charges 
of aggravated assault and 
related crimes. He was not 
available for comment.

Amaris Whitaker, a mas-
ter’s student in public policy 
and management at Heinz 
College, and her attorneys 
from the Mizner Law ?rm ?led 
a complaint against the Static 
nightclub on Feb. 23, alleging 
the club discriminated against 
Whitaker due to a disability. 
Speci?cally, Whitaker as-
serts that the club failed to 
make reasonable accommo-
dations and then barred her 
from entering because she 
needed a chair near the dance 
?oor. Such discrimination has 
historically been prohibited 
under the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act (ADA).
Whitaker has dif?culty 
standing and walking due to 
a congenital joint difference 
known as arthrogryposis. “At 
birth, my joints were quite 
dis?gured,” she said. “I was 
able to have surgeries and 
have things restructured so I 
could at least walk and dress 
myself.” 
Despite her disability, 
Whitaker enjoys dancing and 
going out with her friends.
Under the ADA, businesses 
must make reasonable ac-
commodations to ensure that 
people with disabilities re-
ceive equal levels of service as 
someone without a disability 
might receive.

Instead of a classroom, a 
poker hall could be found in 
room 6115 of the Gates Hill-
man Complex on Thursday 
night. Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents were treated to a poker 
tournament and free dinner 
courtesy of Susquehanna In-
ternational Group (SIG), an 
international trading and in-
vestment ?rm. 
The company, which is 
based in Philadelphia, has run 
this event before at several 
other colleges and universi-
ties, but this was its ?rst tour-
nament at Carnegie Mellon. 
SIG runs events such as the 
poker tournament in order to 
recruit college students with 
skills in mathematics and 
risk management to work for 
them.
The competition consisted 
of 12-minute rounds of Texas 
Hold ’Em, with each contes-
tant starting with $500 in 
chips. SIG employees in vari-
ous departments sat as dealers 
at each of the tables. 
At stake in the competi-
tion were several prizes, with 
the top three players receiv-
ing the latest iPad, an Xbox 
360 with Kinect, and a Kindle 
Fire. Other players that made 
it to the later rounds received 
signed copies of a book about 
poker authored in part by Bill 
Chen, a quantitative analyst, 
the head of the statistical ar-
bitage group at SIG, and an

Carnegie Mellon chemis-
try professor Danith Ly has 
invented an easier, less ex-
pensive technique for manu-
facturing cyclic peptides. 
Cyclic peptides are ring-
shaped chains of amino ac-
ids. Some cyclic peptides can 
be used to combat serious 
diseases, including HIV and 
SARS.
Carnegie Mellon chemists 
have speci?cally focused on 
synthesizing a cyclic peptide 
known as RTD-1.
“RTD-1 is part of the in-
nate immune system of ma-
caques and baboons, and at 
one time it was part of our 
immune system,” Ly said in 
a university press release. “If 
we can reproduce this pep-
tide, we possibly could treat 
a wide range of infections to 
which humans were once im-
mune.”
The synthetic peptide has 
now proven effective against 
E. coli, listeria, staphylococ-
cus and salmonella — all of 
which are fought by RTD-1.
The researchers now hope 
to test the synthetic peptide 
against other pathogens, spe-
ci?cally ones resistant to an-
tibiotics. Chemists also plan 
to reproduce and synthesize 
other cyclic peptides using 
Ly’s method.
The research for this proj-
ect was funded by the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, 
the National Science Founda-
tion, and the DSF Charitable 
Foundation.

While video game con-
soles like the Xbox 360 have 
long been known to con-
sume excessive amounts of 
electricity, Carnegie Mellon 
researchers are proposing 
strategies for more energy-
ef?cient entertainment. 
Engineering and pub-
lic policy doctoral students 
Eric Hittinger and Kimberley 
Mullins and engineering and 
public policy professor Inês 
Lima de Azevedo’s recent ar-
ticle “Electricity consumption 
and energy savings potential 
of video game consoles in the 
United States,” published in 
Energy Ef?ciency, offers a 
simple and virtually free so-
lution to the problem.
Much of the electricity 
cost associated with the use 
of these video game systems 
originates in users’ choice not 
to shut down the devices after 
they ?nish using them. As a 
result, consoles consume ap-
proximately 1 percent of the 
residential electricity used in 
the United States — although 
fewer than half of the house-
holds in the population have 
the devices.
The solution proposed by 
researchers is to simply cre-
ate a ?rmware update that 
most users get automatically 
from the manufacturers. The 
update could create a default 
setting to put the consoles to 
sleep after one hour, possi-
bly reducing electricity con-
sumption of game consoles 
by 75 percent. This solution is 
estimated to save consumers 
$1 billion annually in elec-
tricity bills.

“What’s ‘reasonable’ can 
vary depending on the situ-
ation,” said master’s in pub-
lic policy and management 
student Jake Oresick, who is 
an intern at Mizner Law and 
a friend of Whitaker. “If it’s 
too much of a burden to pro-
vide accommodations, then it 
might not be ‘reasonable.’ ”
Oresick gave as an example 
that while the ADA might re-
quire a bookstore to provide 
a wheelchair ramp, it does 
not require that the bookstore 
stock all of its books in braille 
for people who are blind.
However, Whitaker and 
Oresick assert that Static 
faced no such burden in pro-
viding a chair. “There was 
plenty of available of seating 
on that night [when I asked 
for a chair]. They were VIP 
seats, but they were empty,” 
Whitaker said. “The issue isn’t 
providing a seat on the dance 
?oor. I just need a seat nearby 
that I can access.”
“I visited the club to see 
what it was like,” Oresick said. 
“There are chairs around, and 
it shouldn’t cost anything or 
inconvenience the business 
terribly to take one chair and 
move it a little closer to the 
dance ?oor.”
Although Whitaker, Ore-
sick, and Mizner Law are al-
leging violations of civil rights, 
Static claims that Whitaker 
was refused admission due to 
behavioral infractions. “We 
feel for Ms. Whitaker’s situa-
tion with her disability, how-
ever that does not give her 
permission to break rules in-
side the facility; she is equal to 
everyone else and must abide 
by the venue’s policies,” said 
Static spokesperson Bruno 
Maroni in an email. “Our com-
pany does not discriminate 
anybody for any reason. Fur-
thermore, our company has 
hosted numerous charitable 
events from Light of Life mis-
sion to the Wheelchair vets 
naming a few.”
While the ADA has been 
interpreted to prohibit refusal 
of service due to disability, it 
does not protect those who 
are denied service due to dis-
orderedly conduct.
Although the club did not 
elaborate on the speci?cs 
of the behavior infractions, 
Whitaker said that she thinks 
Maroni is referring to a con-
versation she had with a man-
ager about a chair. She does 
not feel that exchange was 
confrontational. “I believe the 
conversation was cordial. I did 
not swear. I was ?rm, but I did 
not yell. I was just assertive in 
the fact that I needed a place 
to sit,” Whitaker said. 
Oresick believes that the 
club will have trouble substan-
tiating its claim in court. “The 
fact that they won’t elaborate 
on her conduct is curious 
enough in itself,” Oresick said.
Whitaker is currently seek-
ing injunctive relief, and Static 
has two weeks left to respond 
to the complaint.

Phillip H. Scanlan, the Aus-
tralian consul general in New 
York, visited Carnegie Mellon 
and gave a lecture last Tues-
day on the future of Australia 
in a changing world. 
Scanlan focused on the fu-
ture of the G-20 and how Aus-
tralia’s position in the world 
will change as its neighboring 
developing nations like Indo-
nesia advance economically.
Scanlan said that Austra-
lia is shifting its strategy from 
that of a big economy to that 
of a consistent high performer. 
According to Scanlan, Austra-
lia has thrived economically, 
but will soon be surpassed by 
its neighbors because of their 
higher populations.
Scanlan believes that the 
solution to this problem is 
global engagement. He said 
that if Australia works with its 
neighbors to promote cooper-
ation in the southwest Paci?c, 
it could create an economic 
environment where each na-
tion bene?ts from each other’s 
growth through the free ?ow 
of ideas, people, and trade.
In order to promote inter-
national cooperation, Scanlan 
founded the non-governmen-
tal organization Australian 
American Leadership Dia-
logue to bring together young 
leaders from the U.S., China, 
India, Australia, and other na-
tions to network and form a 
spirit of partnership and col-
laboration. 
Scanlan has continued his 
efforts toward international 
cooperation as consul gen-
eral through the New York 
Young Leaders program. The 
program gives young leaders 
the opportunity to discuss is-
sues behind closed doors, free 
from the pressure of internal 
politics or other political and 
cultural norms that stand be-
tween their nations.
Master’s student at the 
Heinz School of Public Policy 
and Management Amy Badi-
ani, who attended a luncheon 
with Scanlan on Wednesday, 
spoke positively of the pro-
gram. “Because of [the pro-
gram’s] nature behind closed 
doors ... young leaders have 
actually created change,” Ba-
diani said.
Scanlan said the goal of 
constructing networks for 
leaders of various nations is 
to solve global issues multi-
laterally. Scanlan pointed to 
climate change, intellectual 
property reform, immigration, 
and the ?ght against human 
traf?cking as global problems 
that require mutual coopera-
tion to ?nd and execute solu-
tions. According to Scanlan, 
while unilateral action can 
improve the situation for one 
nation, without international 
accord, problems simply shift 
across borders.
Students who attended the 
lecture and luncheon seemed 
to ?nd Scanlan’s ideas inter-
esting. “I think it was good 
that he visited CMU, because 
he was able to convey Austra-
lia’s role in global politics,” 
Badiani said.
“[The lecture] was infor-
mative,” said Carmen East-
erwood, a senior economics 
major. “He seems like a really 
intelligent guy.”
Poker player.
“Poker is about making 
decisions based on incom-
plete information, which 
is also the world you trade 
in,” said Amy Lin, one of the 
employees who acted as a 
dealer. 
According to Lin, poker 
is an important part of the 
corporate culture at SIG. 
“The founders played a lot, 
and options are a bit like 
poker,” Lin explained. “How 
much am I paying and what 
am I paying?”
SIG promotes a high de-
gree of integration between 
both the technological and 
trading aspects of commod-
ities, derivatives, and other 
trade options. 
SIG recruiters said they 
were drawn to Carnegie 
Mellon because of the  high 
concentration of techni-
cal skills and quantitative 
minds on campus.
Although competition 
was stiff, it was not hostile. 
Apoorv Khandelwal, a se-
nior electrical and comput-
er engineering major, was 
one of the ?rst eliminated, 
with an Ace Jack Heart 
Flush to a King Queen Heart 
Flush. 
Although he felt bad 
about losing so early in the 
tournament, Khandelwal 
said he felt the competition 
was a worthwhile event. 
“Not many companies have 
a poker event,” Khandelwal 
said. “I played some poker 
and learned a bit about the 
company.”

HOW THINGS WORK
Arti?cial sweeteners have varied history
NIHARIKA SINGH
Staffwriter
Arti?cial sweeteners can be 
found in many college staples, 
from diet sodas and low-fat 
yogurts to canned fruit and 
chewing gum. Their populari-
ty is due in part to their advan-
tage over regular sugar: They 
can greatly sweeten foods 
while avoiding the calories 
sugar adds. However, they are 
also the subject of controversy 
because of their potentially 
unhealthy effects. 
According to the Mayo 
Clinic, there are ?ve widely 
used arti?cial sweeteners that 
have been approved by the 
FDA; these are called intense 
sweeteners because of their 
capability to sweeten foods 
several times more intensely 
than regular sugar. 
This characteristic of ar-
ti?cial sweeteners can be a 
pitfall for students wanting a 
healthy diet, said Paula Mar-
tin, a nutritionist at Carnegie 
Mellon. “Arti?cial sweeten-
ers [are] many or a hundred 
times sweeter than naturally 
occurring sweeteners,” Martin 
explained. “This may change 
a person’s taste preference to 
only accept extremely sweet-
tasting foods and thus reduce 
enjoyment of naturally sweet-
ened foods like vegetables, 
fruits, and grains.”
According to Time maga-
zine, the ?rst arti?cial sweet-
ener was discovered in 1879 
by Johns Hopkins University 
scientist Constantin Fahlberg. 
He noticed that his food tasted 
especially sweet when he ate it 
with his hands after working 
on ?nding interesting uses for 
coal tar. After some research, 
Fahlberg was able to isolate 
the compound responsible 
for the sweet taste: saccharin. 
Soon after its discovery, some 
scientists tried to ban the use 
of saccharin in 1911 because 
they believed it was an adul-
terant that altered food sub-
stances. 
Saccharin was linked to 
cancer in rats in 1977, and al-
though the FDA couldn’t ban 
the substance, the discovery 
made it mandatory for sub-
stances containing saccharin 
to carry a warning label. In 
2000, saccharin was removed 
from the government’s list of 
suspected carcinogens, but 
the suspicion of its possible 
harmful side effects still wor-
ries many consumers. 
The sweetener cyclamate 
was widely used in the 1950s 
because it tasted more natu-
ral than saccharin and didn’t 
have a metallic aftertaste. 
However, in 1969, the gov-
ernment banned cyclamate 
because of studies linking it to 
cancer and to the formation of 
deformities in chicken embry-
os. Cyclamate is still approved 
for use in more than 55 coun-
tries, including Canada. 
The FDA has established 
an acceptable daily intake 
for each arti?cial sweetener, 
which ranges from ?ve to 50 
milligrams per kilogram. 
Using arti?cial sweeteners 
in baking can lead to inter-
esting consequences, as se-
nior electrical and computing 
engineering major Rebecca 
Willmott discovered. She 
recounted her experience: 
“I baked a cake with lemon 
cream icing for someone who 
couldn’t eat sugar once, and 
the arti?cial sweetener react-
ed with the acid in the lemon 
juice to create an expanding 
icing which ended up around 
[three times] the volume it 
started at.”
There are alternatives 
to arti?cial sweeteners. So-
called novel sweeteners are 
becoming more popular. One 
of these, called stevia, is com-
monly prepared by drying ste-
via plants and extracting the 
sweetening compounds by a 
water extraction process. 
Other alternatives are nat-
ural sweeteners such as honey, 
maple syrup, and agave nec-
tar. Although natural sweet-
eners are similar to regular 
sugar in that they can cause 
weight gain and tooth decay, 
many people prefer these be-
cause of their unique taste or 
possible health bene?ts. Many 
people consider these natural 
sweeteners to be safer than ar-
ti?cial sweeteners.
While it is true that no stud-
ies have conclusively shown 
that arti?cial sweeteners on 
the market should be banned, 
other studies — such as those 
conducted on rats at Purdue 
University — have suggested 
a link between consumption 
of arti?cial sweeteners and in-
crease in body weight.
Currently, the American 
Dietetic Association recom-
mends that all types of sweet-
eners can be enjoyed in mod-
eration “when consumed in a 
diet that is guided by current 
federal nutrition recommen-
dations.”

Teams prepare mobots for Carnival
DANIEL TKACIK
SciTech Editor
Students were turning 
wrenches, twisting screw-
drivers, and writing code this 
past week in preparation for 
the upcoming Mobot com-
petition, the annual “mobile 
robot” contest hosted by the 
School of Computer Science. 
The activities coincided well 
with the fact that it was Na-
tional Robotics Week, which 
celebrates robotics research in 
the United States.
Mobot, which ?rst made its 
debut at Carnegie Mellon 17 
years ago as an alternative to 
the Buggy races at Spring Car-
nival, lets students from any 
discipline compete in a robot-
ics challenge. Members of par-
ticipating teams assemble mo-
bots, autonomous self-driving 
robots equipped with mo-
tors and sensors that enable 
them to follow a white line 
painted on the ground and 
pass through systematically 
positioned gates. The course 
is located on the walkway in 
front of Wean Hall; teams are 
judged on accuracy and time.
Last Wednesday, the Mo-
bot Committee hosted the $99 
Mini Challenge, an event to al-
low Mobot participants to re-
ceive technical assistance with 
their mobots as well as com-
pete in two smaller events. 
The “Slalom Challenge” re-
quired mobots to successfully 
pass through all of the gates 
in the slalom portion of the 
course, and the “Decision-
Point Challenge” required mo-
bots to make it past a section 
of the course consisting of di-
verging and converging white 
lines designed to confuse the 
vehicles.
“Imagine teaching some-
one how to ski a slalom, a 
downhill ski course. We’re 
teaching a robot to do the 
same thing,” said Nolan Her-
gert, a senior electrical and 
computer engineering major 
and a member of the $99 Mini 
Challenge’s winning team. 
Team Gaussian Blur — made 
up of Hergert and fellow se-
nior electrical and computer 
engineering majors Billy Keyes 
and Chao Wang — cleared the 
slalom section of the course in 
36.74 seconds.
Keyes explained that mak-
ing a robot perform the task 
of following a white line is not 
nearly as easy as it sounds. “It’s 
easy for you to just say, ‘It’s the 
white paint on the ground!’ 
But how do you explain that to 
someone that doesn’t neces-
sarily understand what white 
is? Or what a line is?”
The Final Mobot Slalom 
Races, to be held on Friday, 
will crown the team whose 
mobot successfully passes 
through the most gates in se-
quence in the shortest amount 
of time. Each team will be al-
lowed two course runs, and 
each team’s best performing 
run will be used to compare 
to other teams’ best perfor-
mances.
The event is sponsored by 
Lockheed Martin, General 
Motors, Two Sigma, Google, 
and Misumi USA. Lockheed 
Martin has “embraced the 
ability of our students and 
the many teams to ?nd their 
unique solutions to some or 
all of the issues involved, at 
all levels of expertise,” said 
Catherine Copetas, the School 
of Computer Science assistant 
dean for industrial relations. 
“GM is a newer sponsor, and 
it goes without saying their 
involvement is a great testi-
monial to the students and the 
effort invested in these races.”
Beyond Carnegie Mellon, 
last week marked the third an-
nual National Robotics Week. 
The U.S. House of Represen-
tatives passed a resolution in 
2010 applying that designa-
tion to the second full week in 
April. Carnegie Mellon plans 
to have an organized celebra-
tion on Friday, involving Ro-
botics Institute lab tours, lec-
tures by robotics professors, 
and the Mobot race ?nals.
Hergert supports the goal 
of recognizing robotics. “Tak-
ing a week and celebrating all 
these devices and appliances 
and their creators that we take 
for granted merits a week in 
my opinion,” he said. 
Canadian mint opens app contest
The Royal Canadian Mint 
has announced the MintChip 
Challenge, a competition for 
software developers to cre-
ate innovative mobile apps 
demonstrating the potential 
uses of MintChip. MintChip 
is a virtual e-currency fully 
backed by the Canadian gov-
ernment, making it the ?rst 
digital currency to be fully 
backed by any government.
“As part of its research 
and development efforts, the 
mint has developed Mint-
Chip, which could be char-
acterized as an evolution 
of physical money with the 
added bene?ts of being elec-
tronic,” said Canadian Mint 
CEO Ian Bennett.
The e-currency techno- 
logy, which is more of a sys-
tem or protocol than a physi-
cal item, allows its users to 
pay for low-cost items on the 
internet or physically with 
apps on their smartphones. 
Like other digital currencies 
such as BitCoin, MintChip 
relies on advanced crypto-
graphic hashing techniques 
to provide security and ano-
nymity for its users.

Team builds ?rst quantum network
Scientists at the Max 
Plank Institute of Quantum 
Optics in Garching, Germany, 
have created the world’s ?rst 
quantum network. The pro-
totype features two single-
atom “nodes” connected by a 
21-meter-long ?ber optic ca-
ble, with each node capable 
of both sending and receiving 
information. A single photon 
traveling through the cable 
relays the state of one quan-
tum node to the other.
Typical electrical bits can 
only represent digital 0s or 
1s at any given time. On the 
other hand, qubits — the 
computational bits that drive 
quantum information tech-
nologies — can represent 
0s and 1s at the same time, 
a phenomenon known as 
superposition. Paired with 
quantum entanglement — 
another property that keeps 
two correlated quantum at-
oms in sync, even over vast 
distances — superposition 
would make a quantum net-
work faster, more secure, 
and much more scalable than 
existing network infrastruc-
tures today.

Supercomputer simulates universe
A group of researchers, led 
by Jean-Michel Alimi at the 
Laboratoire Univers et Théo-
rie in Paris, has performed 
the ?rst ever computer simu-
lation of the structuring of 
the observable universe. The 
simulation spans from the 
Big Bang to the present day, 
and its completion marks 
the ?rst of three phases of 
the group’s larger project, 
dubbed “Deus: full universe 
run.” Two more runs will be 
completed by late May, with 
scientists expecting the simu-
lations to provide support for 
other scienti?c endeavors to 
map out the universe. 
The tests were performed 
on France’s CURIE, one of the 
world’s most powerful super-
computers. CURIE’s 92,000 
CPUs are capable of two pet-
a?ops — 2 quadrillion opera-
tions a second.

Baboons learn pre-reading skills
A team of French scientists 
announced last week that 
they have managed to teach 
six Guinea baboons (Papio 
papio) pre-reading — the 
ability to differentiate Eng-
lish words from non-English 
words. After six weeks of 
training, the baboons were 
consistently choosing four-
letter English words dis-
played to them on a comput-
er among an array of 7,832 
four-letter non-words. They 
averaged 75 percent correct, 
with some scoring as high as 
90 percent.
“It’s not just memorizing,” 
said team researcher Jona-
than Grainger. “It’s picking 
up what we call these statisti-
cal regularities: Certain letter 
combinations appear more 
frequently in words than in 
non-words.”

Engineered stem cells ?ght off HIV
Researchers at the Univer-
sity of California, Los Angeles 
have demonstrated for the 
?rst time that stem cells can 
be genetically engineered to 
attack HIV-infected cells in 
living organisms.
Expanding on previous 
research showing that the 
technique was possible, the 
team implanted living mice 
with human thymus tissue 
containing genetically engi-
neered T-cell receptor mol-
ecules from cells that help 
fend off infection. Over the 
course of six weeks, the re-
searchers discovered that 
the number of CD4 “helper” 
T-cells — which become de-
pleted as a result of HIV in-
fection — increased, while 
levels of HIV in the mice’s 
blood decreased.

Apple addresses Flashback malware
Apple has released a se-
curity update that removes 
most variants of the OS X tro-
jan Flashback, though critics 
claim the company was too 
slow in releasing the patch. 
The trojan, ?rst detected 
April 3 and believed to have 
infected up to 600,000 Macs, 
works by exploiting a vulner-
ability in the Java software 
framework in order to send 
users’ private information to 
unauthorized remote servers.
While the OS X platform 
has typically been lauded for 
being “virus-free,” a recent 
popularity surge in Apple’s 
Macbook and iMac models 
has given hackers more in-
centive to target the platform.

Researchers use multiple techniques to study autism
VICKI CHENG
Junior Staffwriter
Autism spectrum disorders 
(ASDs) are a class of develop-
mental disabilities with mys-
terious origins and profound 
effects on individuals and 
families. Much remains to be 
learned about ASDs; research 
groups from several ?elds at 
Carnegie Mellon, including 
psychology and human-com-
puter interaction, are working 
to understand their complexi-
ties. Researchers from each of 
these disciplines take different 
approaches to understanding 
individuals affected by ASDs.
In the cognitive psychology 
department, members of pro-
fessor Marcel Just’s research 
group seek to identify differ-
ences in brain mechanisms be-
tween autistic and non-autistic 
individuals. They use func-
tional magnetic resonance im-
aging (fMRI) to detect regions 
and patterns of brain activity 
when individuals are asked to 
perform certain tasks. Ph.D. 
student Sarah Schipul uses 
this approach to understand 
how autistic individuals learn.
In one study, both autistic 
and non-autistic participants 
were trained to perform a 
particular task while undergo-
ing a brain scan. While both 
groups were able to learn and 
perform the task successfully 
after training, results did show 
a difference in brain activation 
patterns. Whereas the control 
participants showed patterns 
of decreasing activation while 
learning the task, autistic par-
ticipants did not. These ?nd-
ings suggest that, even though 
autistic individuals are capa-
ble of learning and performing 
a task, they are not able to re-
duce mental effort during the 
course of the learning process. 
“If brain imaging stud-
ies can reveal the nature of 
atypical behaviors in autism, 
we may be able to inform in-
tervention studies that help 
individuals with autism adapt 
to the world around them,” 
Schipul said.
Fellow researcher Akiko 
Mizuno also uses fMRI in her 
research, but her focus is on 
understanding brain mecha-
nisms involved with autistic 
people’s interpersonal interac-
tions. Individuals with autism 
often have dif?culties with 
social interaction and face 
challenges in understanding 
others. Mizuno and collabo-
rators scanned brain activity 
while participants performed 
a language task requiring the 
comprehension and use of 
pronouns. Autistic individuals 
often had dif?culty correctly 
processing pronouns, particu-
larly the word “you.” While 
the individuals performed the 
task, anomalous activity was 
found in regions of the brain 
responsible for the concept of 
self-identity.
“We suspect that the neu-
ral process of understanding 
the social world in relation to 
oneself is altered in autism,” 
Mizuno said. The results from 
Mizuno’s work underscore 
the potential importance of 
training people with autism 
in what psychologists refer to 
as “perspective-taking” — put-
ting oneself in others’ shoes.
Using a slightly different 
approach, researchers in the 
Human-Computer Interaction 
Institute (HCII) make use of 
the perspective-taking con-
cept to design and improve 
computer systems from the 
viewpoint of people with au-
tism. While human-computer 
interaction research has been 
applied to assist those who 
are severely impaired by au-
tism, 2011 HCII Ph.D. gradu-
ate Moira Burke noticed that 
little research had examined 
the needs of high-functioning 
individuals.
“Adults on the high-func-
tioning end of the autism 
spectrum — including those 
with Asperger’s — often don’t 
have obvious signs of a disabil-
ity, and when they have dif-
?culty interpreting nonverbal 
cues, they can come across as 
socially awkward and are re-
jected for it,” Burke said. “We 
need far more research that 
examines the strengths and 
needs of adults on the autism 
spectrum.” 
Burke sought to understand 
the social communication 
needs of high-functioning au-
tistic individuals and to iden-
tify ways that computer-based 
communication could be used 
to help them. Through a series 
of observations and interviews 
with high-functioning autistic 
adults, Burke found that indi-
viduals experienced both ben-
e?ts and particular challenges 
in communicating through 
email, text messages, and so-
cial networks. 
While some participants 
found reduced stress levels 
from interacting with others 
via computer, many partici-
pants also experienced dif-
?culties in understanding 
some nuances of online social 
interaction, indicating that 
opportunities exist to improve 
computer-based experiences 
for these individuals. 
Research on autism en-
compasses a wide spectrum 
of disciplines and approaches. 
While these studies differ in 
approach, they are united in 
their common goal of under-
standing this disability, with 
the hopes of vastly improving 
quality of life for those affect-
ed by autism.
“We need far more research that 
examines the strengths and needs 
of adults on the autism spectrum.”

HCII Ph.D. graduate

Carnival shows need more venue space for demand
Spring Carnival 2012 is this 
weekend, and the list of events is 
overwhelming. Big names in enter-
tainment like Nick Offerman (who 
plays Ron Swanson from Parks and 
Recreation) and Passion Pit will per-
form, hopefully making this year’s 
Carnival incredible.
There is a lot of pressure to con-
tact prominent bands and perform-
ers and reel them in for our Carnival 
show. AB Concert and AB Comedy 
deserve a solid thank you and rec-
ognition for bringing in these per-
formers, with an additional thanks 
to Student Activities and Under-
graduate Student Senate for help-
ing with the funding to pay for such 
entertainment.
However, there is a signi?cant 
chance that not every student will 
be able to enjoy the Carnival enter-
tainment this year. Tickets for the 
comedy and concert shows of?cially 
opened last Tuesday around noon 
and were sold out within a matter of 
hours. While this demonstrates how 
excited students were for the events, 
it seems that a lot of students could 
be left out of some of the fun this 
weekend.
While the wristbands are only 
needed in the case that it rains and 
the venue has to be moved indoors, 
Pittsburgh’s weather is sporadic at 
best. There is a 50 percent chance of 
rain on Saturday, when the concert 
is scheduled. If the performances do 
need to be moved inside, only 1,400 
students out of about 9,000 (gradu-
ate and undergraduate) will be able 
to enjoy them.
AB Comedy and AB Concerts did 
a good job at getting these entertain-
ers. However, considering the hype 
that comes with these performers 
and the general excitement sur-
rounding Carnival shows, it would 
have been wise for the clubs to utilize 
a more suitable (i.e. larger) indoor 
venue. For example, possibly mov-
ing the venue to a place off campus 
and providing shuttles would be ben-
e?cial, because it would have meant 
that more students could enjoy the 
performers AB Comedy and AB Con-
certs worked so hard to get.

City in need of college seniors to stay in Pittsburgh
College seniors at the University 
of Pittsburgh, the Community Col-
lege of Allegheny County, Point Park 
University, and Carnegie Mellon re-
ceived an email last Tuesday from 
Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl. 
In the email, Ravenstahl encouraged 
them to stay in Pittsburgh after grad-
uation, highlighting that Pittsburgh 
has so much to offer young people, 
from available jobs to high quality of 
life and affordability.
If Ravenstahl and other city of?-
cials want to reinvigorate Pittsburgh 
by bringing in and keeping younger 
people, the bene?ts of living in the 
city need to be made clear to college 
students and other young adults. 
Pittsburgh has received numer-
ous accolades, such as being called 
the “most livable city” in the U.S. last 
year by the Economist Intelligence 
Unit, and being given the same title 
from Forbes.com in 2010.
However, what matters to college 
graduates now, during a recession, 
is job availability. For Carnegie Mel-
lon students in particular, Pittsburgh 
lacks the reputation that other cities 
and regions have. 
The 2011 Post Graduation Survey 
for the School of Computer Science 
shows 39 percent of computer sci-
ence graduates going to California 
after graduation. 
The post-graduation surveys 
of other Carnegie Mellon majors 
also show a signi?cant amount of 
students leaving the mid-Atlantic 
region.
At the moment, Pittsburgh 
doesn’t carry the weight that Silicon 
Valley and Seattle have for the tech-
nology ?elds, nor does it boast the 
artistic reputations of New York City 
or Los Angeles.
But it deserves such recogni-
tion. Pittsburgh is becoming a hub 
for technology, medicine, and com-
merce. High-pro?le companies like 
Apple, Intel, and Microsoft that en-
tice Carnegie Mellon graduates to go 
out west are interested in the Pitts-
burgh region, with Google being a 
notable example with its East Liberty 
location. According to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, between March 
2010 and March 2011, 5,300 jobs 
were created in Pittsburgh’s educa-
tion and health services supersector 
alone.
What it comes down to is a need 
for Ravenstahl, Governor Tom Cor-
bett, and other of?cials in the region 
to stress how the city is growing — 
not in numbers or awards, but by 
making college graduates aware of 
the opportunities for their careers 
are in Pittsburgh. 
The city may be in the baby stages 
of signi?cant growth and develop-
ment, but such growth has to be fa-
cilitated by continuing to convince 
young people and families to reside 
in Pittsburgh.
Book censorship stops progress of democracy
MICHAEL KAHN
“Ignorance is strength.”
This is the unspoken creed of 
censors and oppressors across the 
globe. Limiting knowledge is the 
surest way of maintaining the status 
quo. 
Fortunately, the United States 
is an open society; people are free 
to speak, free to read, free to learn. 
Americans can ?nd knowledge in 
their public libraries on any subject 
they can imagine. They need not 
fear books being removed by intol-
erant or fearful censors.
That, at least, is what I believed 
growing up, as I spent hours explor-
ing school and public libraries. The 
truth is less pleasant.
Last Monday, the American Li-
brary Association released the State 
of America’s Libraries Report 2012, 
an annual report that includes a sec-
tion on intellectual freedom with a 
list of the most banned books of the 
year. 
Banned books conjure memories 
of totalitarian Soviet Russia, the In-
quisition, and McCarthyism. It is en-
forced ignorance with no recourse, 
for how can one protest when 
knowledge itself is hidden?
The books on the ALA list are a 
strange mix including literary clas-
sics and modern teen ?ction. The in-
tellectually stirring works of Lauren 
Myracle — the novels ttyl, ttfn, and 
l8r g8r — share space with To Kill a 
Mockingbird by Harper Lee and My 
Mom’s Having A Baby! A Kid’s Month-
by-Month Guide to Pregnancy by Dori 
Hillestad Butler.
At ?rst glance, there is little to as-
sociate Brave New World by Aldous 
Huxley (No. 7) with the Gossip Girl 
series by Cecily Von Ziegesar (No. 
9). The ALA helpfully provides the 
reasons these books were attacked. 
“Nudity” or “sexually explicit” was 
listed for eight of the top 10 targets. 
Some exceptions were The Hun-
ger Games series by Suzanne Col-
lins, which was instead called out 
for being insensitive and satanic, 
among other reasons, while To Kill 
a Mockingbird was criticized for 
its offensive language and racism. 
Those seeking to ban these books 
point out the damaging effect sexu-
ally explicit content has on children. 
And their argument is compelling; 
I’m sure that the teenagers reading 
Brave New World are precisely the 
ones most likely to start having orgy-
porgies.
Today’s libraries provide elec-
tronic resources that are just as im-
portant as their paper counterparts. 
The forces of censorship have fol-
lowed this digital transition, and 
libraries face demands to restrict 
the sites their users can visit on the 
internet. School and public libraries 
have legitimate reasons for block-
ing pornography and sites known 
for malware, but restricting access 
because of political or religious 
views steps far over the line. The 
ALA points out one instance when a 
library patron tried to research Wic-
ca, Native American religions, and 
astrology but was blocked by the 
library’s ?ltering software. Schools 
across the country block Wikipedia 
in part or entirely.
Intellectual freedom is being 
threatened by attempts to ban books 
and block websites. 
In any democratic society, knowl-
edge must be both a right and a 
choice. 
People can choose ignorance if 
they wish, but they cannot force it 
on others. Public libraries are re-
positories of this knowledge, and 
attempts to censor them are simply 
inexcusable.

tributing editor for The Tartan. The 
Carnegie Library in Oakland is his

With Rick Santorum out of the 
race for the Republican Presidential 
nomination, the campaign for the 
White House can really begin. For 
the Republicans’ sake, this is good. 
The longer they took to decide on 
an approach, the less it seemed they 
had a chance. Now the Republicans 
can rally around Mitt Romney to give 
Obama a run for his money.
It is possible of course that the Re-
publicans could ?nd two exceptional 
candidates in an election cycle whose 
battle for the ticket could cause the 
party to hone its positions and take 
pride in its candidates. However, in 
this case it seems more like they were 
faced with two mediocre candidates, 
the lesser of which was dif?cult to 
decide. 
Santorum ended his campaign 
after a weekend with his family, not-
ing that he was not leaving politics 
but leaving this particular race. We 
may see him again in 2016, as we see 
Romney now four years after his un-
successful 2008 campaign. 
But now, perhaps by touting a 
weak economy and somewhat un-
popular health care bill, Romney 
might provide a formidable chal-
lenge for Obama. By having the best 
candidates from both major parties 
focus on what they can do in the Oval 
Of?ce, instead of focusing in simply 
getting the party nomination, the 
future President of the United States 
can achieve more progress.
With habitual Republican voters, 
moderate Republicans, the moral 
right, and Tea Party members, the 
Republican party has a dif?cult 
task to present a coherent strategy. 
Presenting one would help guide 
the party to a state where, whoever 
wins, both parties can unite together 
after the election to do what is right 
for the country. 
That is something that everyone 
should be able to agree on, Santo-
rum and all.

People can choose 
ignorance if they 
wish, but they 
cannot force it 
on others. Public 
libraries are 
repositories of this 
knowledge, and 
attempts to censor 
them are simply 
inexcusable.

A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled by Jonathan Carreon and Jennifer Coloma
Spring Carnival is this week, so we asked,
What about Spring Carnival are you most excited about?

Ozzie Guillen, manager for the 
Miami Marlins, was recently been 
criticized for his comments in Time 
magazine on Cuban dictator Fidel 
Castro. Guillen was quoted in an 
interview, “I respect Fidel Castro 
... You know why? Many people 
have tried to kill Castro in the last 
60 years, yet that [expletive] is still 
there.” 
His statement sparked outrage 
among Cuban-Americans in Miami 
and resulted in a ?ve-game suspen-
sion without pay. Although Guillen 
deserves the reprimands from en-
raged citizens, he does not deserve 
to be suspended for his comment.
While his viewpoint was incon-
siderate of the Cuban-Americans 
in Miami who have lost family and 
property to Castro’s rule, he had no 
intention to make a political state-
ment or endorse Castro’s atrocities.
Instead, the statement was at 
most an attempt at humor gone 
wrong. In the article “Is Castro 
Cuban-Americans’ Hitler?” in the 
Huf?ngton Post, Charles Garcia, CEO 
of Hispanic merchant bank Garcia 
Trujillo, said Guillen is “legendary 
for putting his foot in his mouth.” 
He has a reputation for saying ab-
surd things, which is simply what 
happened during his interview with 
Time magazine.
Guillen was quick to apologize 
and make clear that he admired Cas-
tro’s ability to evade death, not his 
inhumane actions. Guillen’s apology 
and insistence on returning to Mi-
ami to answer questions show that 
he did not mean harm to those af-
fected by Castro’s reign. 
The embarrassment he has faced, 
even after his apology, is a proper 
way to stress the need for sensitiv-
ity when discussing controversial 
subjects, but such embarrassment is 
punishment enough.
There is also Guillen’s freedom 
of speech to be protected. Everyone 
in the United States has the right to 
voice his or her opinions. 
There are many examples of 
controversy surrounding comments 
of other professionals in the sports 
world, such as Pittsburgh Steeler 
Rashard Mendenhall’s tweets last 
year that decried the celebrations 
surrounding the death of terror-
ist Osama Bin Laden. However, the 
controversy did not result in any di-
rect punishment from the Steelers’ 
management.
Guillen should not be profession-
ally disciplined for voicing his opin-
ion when other athletes have gone 
unpunished for equally controver-
sial comments.
Ultimately, the controversy over 
Guillen’s interview should have re-
sulted in a lesson for him and the 
American people, rather than a 
suspension. The reaction to Guil-
len is a reminder that one must be 
careful and considerate when speak-
ing about issues that have not yet 
healed, including cultural and ethi-
cal wounds. 
It should not, however, be a les-
son to teach Americans that unpop-
ular opinions will be suppressed, 
just as Castro suppressed speech for 
the refugees who are now living in 
Miami.
Guillen should not be punished for remarksDesperation for tech too extreme
ELANA GOLDBERG
Junior Staffwriter
It’s safe to say that people here at 
Carnegie Mellon adore their technol-
ogy. However, a teenager in China 
who sold an organ for an iPhone and 
an iPad may have surpassed any Ap-
ple fanatic here.
On April 6, reports of the story 
broke from Chenzhou, a city in 
China’s Hunan province. A teenager 
with the surname Wang wanted an 
iPhone and an iPad. The black mar-
ket wanted a kidney. Five people 
helped 17-year-old Wang surgically 
remove his kidney. 
This black market deal was a 
clean-cut procedure. It wasn’t as 
though a handful of felons carved 
out his kidney with a pocketknife; 
there was a professional on board.
This group included a practicing 
doctor in addition to criminals, such 
as transplant organizer He Wei, who 
turned to crime after accumulating 
gambling debts. The group is cur-
rently being charged with “inten-
tional injury.”
The procedure collected 220,000 
yuan, approximately $35,000. Wei 
distributed the money amongst the 
accomplices and medical of?cials 
who helped with the procedure. 
Wang received 22,000 yuan, ap-
proximately $3,500, in exchange for 
his kidney.
Exchanging an organ for cash is 
simply stupid, especially when the 
reason is to buy an iPhone and an 
iPad. Under special, extreme cir-
cumstances, selling an organ could 
be justi?ed. But selling a kidney 
to satisfy the need to keep up with 
the latest technology trend is not 
a necessity, and it’s de?nitely not 
worth the medical risk. 
Besides, what happens when the 
iPhone 5 comes out? There are only 
so many organs to go around for Ap-
ple products.
As shocking as it seems that 
someone would just sell his kidney in 
order to keep up with new technol-
ogy, the most mind-blowing part of 
this story is the fact that Wang only 
received 10 percent of the pro?ts 
from selling his kidney. 
He was completely ripped off. 
Obviously he can’t cut labor costs, 
but in the grand scheme of things, to 
receive such a small amount for such 
a huge procedure is not quite fair. 
Sure $3,500 is enough to pay for the 
iPhone and the iPad, and still have 
plenty of cash left over for fun Apple 
accessories, but is that really enough 
to suf?ce for the loss of a perfectly 
healthy kidney?
The moral of the story is that if 
you’re going to sell your kidney, be 
smart and demand more for it — just 
kidding. 
The real moral of the story is that 
desperation for the latest and great-
est technology is unhealthy. 
Wang’s desire for Apple products 
is an example of extreme consumer-
ism, and it represents the extent to 
which people try to keep up with the 
latest fad. 
Wang physically harmed himself 
to keep up with technology trends, 
and in the process, he lost a kidney, 
a deal, and his dignity.
PATRICK GAGE KELLEY
Is every e-book, or even every e-
bestseller, worth $9.99?
They aren’t. Have you seen what 
makes the bestseller’s shelf? Half of 
them aren’t actually written by their 
“authors” and far too many seem to 
have editors who have perennially 
stepped out for a lunch break. 
Quality of content aside, what 
exactly is it I should be paying for: 
the author’s blood, sweat, and ink? 
Should I pay three times as much for 
Haruki Murakami’s 1Q84 — three 
“books” published as a single volume, 
topping 900 pages — or should Ju-
lian Barnes’ Man Booker Prize-win-
ner Sense of an Ending be discounted 
due to its brevity? 
Is it just a novel that is worth 
$9.99, or is a novella worth the same? 
If I serialize my story, do I make more 
or less? Are graphic novels the same, 
and what about non-?ction?
Should anyone even be publishing 
short stories anymore? As a society, 
should we just stop reading — espe-
cially on paper?
The book publishing industry is 
just one more 19th-century innova-
tion disrupted by the rise of digital 
information transfer and ubiquitous 
computing devices. This transition, or 
more aptly revolution, shifted control 
of book pricing from physical and lo-
cal bookstores to Amazon — not to a 
sea of competitive e-book sellers, but 
to a monolithic entity whose storage 
and distribution costs are negligent 
and who has much greater restric-
tions over post-sale transfers.
Through Amazon, e-books have 
been commoditized: $9.99 for every 
book. You purchase it and it cannot 
be transferred. You don’t own a phys-
ical object, you can’t hold it in your 
hand, you can’t lend it to a friend who 
is browsing your bookshelves, and 
you can’t donate it to the local library 
when you are done.
E-books, and the entire book 
ecosystem as a whole, is irreparably 
damaged by Amazon’s actions. The 
local bookstore and even the national 
chains are dying or dead. The quality 
of the book as an object and of the 
content itself as having worth is lost 
with the rise of e-books. 
Most unfortunately, the act of 
reading hasn’t improved. You can 
carry thousands of books with you 
at a time, but reading and the asso-
ciated actions of thinking or learn-
ing haven’t been bene?cially trans-
formed in these early stages of our 
digitalization.
And this is why the Department of 
Justice’s lawsuit charging Apple and 
?ve book publishers with colluding to 
raise the price of e-books stings to the 
erudite loyalists among us. 
Bibliophiles who care for the book 
and the material inside it are not be-
ing helped by forcing book publish-
ers to spend their already-limited 
resources ?ghting lawsuits that will 
save consumers an insigni?cant two 
dollars a book. 
If the publishers don’t all settle 
(and it seems Macmillan and Pen-
guin will rightfully not), the technol-
ogy will have radically evolved to be 
so distant from the current landscape 
that the suits will be irrelevant long 
before they are resolved.
I offer this solution to the publish-
ers: Tell Amazon if it requires — and 
if the Department of Justice regulates 
— the ability to set its own prices, 
then you simply cannot do business 
with them. 
Set up your own digital store-
fronts. Sell e-books in the formats of 
your choice for as much as you’d like 
and as much as the market will pay. 
If you truly stand behind your 
agency model, ?ght for it by making 
it the standard. It provides clearer 
revenue models for digital sales and 
allows you the freedom you want.
It isn’t collusion if you each han-
dle it in the way that makes sense 
for your publishing house, your cus-
tomers, and your books — keep the 
books the ?rst priority. 
And while you are building these 
digital storefronts, remind us, the 
readers, and society as a whole why 
you are still relevant at all in a world 
of simple and direct self-publishing. 
Prove you can innovate: Bring in 
the digital humanists, the internet 
publishers, the minds behind extend-
ing ePub and push out digital books 
that disrupt the act of reading. Give 
your e-books more than just re?owed 
text: Give them life.

SPORTS COMMENTARYPenguins struggle with Flyers
CARL GLAZER
Staffwriter
In their ?rst three games 
of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, 
the Pittsburgh Penguins’ of-
fense has scored 12 goals. 
The problem is with their de-
fense, which gave up 20 goals 
against the Philadelphia Fly-
ers over the same time frame.
The playoffs opened 
Wednesday night at the CON-
SOL Energy Center. The Pen-
guins came out strong, taking 
a commanding 3–0 lead after 
the ?rst period. After holding 
the Flyers to only one goal in 
the second period, the Pen-
guins’ defense gave out. The 
Flyers scored two quick goals 
in the third and ?nished off 
the comeback with a fast goal 
in overtime.
The second game also fea-
tured the Penguins at home, 
following a similar script. The 
Penguins again jumped out to 
a 2–0 lead, helped by Captain 
Sidney Crosby’s goal 15 sec-
onds into the game. Although 
their defense was struggling, 
they also had leads of 3–1, 
4–3, and 5–4 before the Fly-
ers took their ?rst lead of the 
game with less than 11 min-
utes left. The Flyers eventu-
ally won 8–5.
The Penguins now ?nd 
themselves down 3–0 in this 
best of seven series, need-
ing to win two games on 
the road in addition to two 
games at home to end the 
Flyers’ season. As was com-
mon during the regular sea-
son, the Penguins’ offense has 
the ?repower to keep up with 
any team in the league.
Once the Penguins take a 
large two- or three-goal lead, 
they switch to a much more 
defensive style of play. How-
ever, this forces the team to 
play to their weaknesses.
The key for the Penguins 
to keep its season alive is to 
never let up. By continuing to 
attack and push the puck up 
the ice, the team can keep the 
pressure off their defense and 
minimize the shots on goalie 
Marc-Andre Fleury.
A team needs to play to its 
strengths, and for the Pen-
guins that means pushing 
the puck into the Flyers’ zone 
and having an unrelenting of-
fense. Unless the team real-
izes that no lead is safe with 
its defense, the season may 
quickly come to an end.
Women’s tennis takes downDenison and Johns Hopkins

The No. 4-ranked women’s 
tennis team took on the No. 
26-ranked Denison Big Red in 
Granville, Ohio, on Saturday. 
The Tartans continued their 
impressive season with a 7–2 
victory over the Big Red, im-
proving their record to 14–3 
for the season.
First-year pair Bryn Ra-
schke and Chelsea Motie, No. 
2 doubles, and sophomore Ka-
tie Cecil and ?rst-year Angela 
Pratt, No. 3 doubles, started 
the day off strong by winning 
their doubles matches 8–1 
and 8–2, respectively. The 
senior duo of Courtney Chin 
and Laura Chen at No. 1 dou-
bles fought hard, but eventu-
ally lost the ?rst doubles in a 
tiebreaker 9–7.
As the day transitioned 
into the singles portion of the 
match, the Tartans took their 
play to the next level and won 
?ve of their six sets. At No. 1 
singles, Cecil won the ?rst 
game handily in straight sets 
6–2, 6–2. This win was fol-
lowed by another victory from 
Motie at No. 3 singles with 
6–3, 6–3. Chen, No. 2 singles, 
then clinched the Tartans’ vic-
tory over the Big Red with her 
hard-fought comeback 6–7, 
6–1, 6–2. Even after the vic-
tory was sealed, the Tartans 
kept their foot on the gas with 
Chin, No. 4 singles, winning 
in straight sets 6–4, 6–3.
The only singles loss of 
the day was a tough battle by 
Pratt at No. 5, winning the 
?rst set in a tiebreaker before 
dropping the last two 6–3, 
6–3. Senior Cze-Ja Tam at 
No. 6 singles ?nished the day 
on a strong note for the Tar-
tans by winning 8–3.
“It was tough waiting all 
day to play and playing in-
doors with only four courts, 
but we were able to adjust 
and pull out a solid win,” Tam 
said.
The Tartans took on 
No. 8-ranked Johns Hopkins 
at home on Sunday. The Tar-
tans won 6–3. The Tartans 
compete next at University 
Athletic Association Champi-
onships  in Orlando, Fla.

ATHLETE PROFILETitus credits his teammates

ALEX TAPAK

After running track and wrestling in 
high school, junior Noel Titus made his way 
onto the Carnegie Mellon men’s track and 
?eld team. Currently, Titus is a civil and 
environmental engineering major. “I hope 
to be a Geotech engineer and do soil analy-
sis,” Titus said, speaking to his future career 
goals.
Titus is proud to be a Tartan. “Going 
places and repping our school, no one here 
really knows what we do,” Titus said.
This season, Titus hopes to improve his 
performance on the second day of Univer-
sity Athletic Association Championships 
(UAAs). “My freshman and sophomore year 
I did well on the ?rst day, but struggled on 
the second day,” Titus said. Outdoor UAAs 
are in two weeks at home for the track and 
?eld team. Currently, Titus is building up 
for his races. “I hurt my hamstring, but it is 
feeling better now. I mostly need to not be 
intimidated,” Titus said.
The most important competition of 
UAAs is at Washington University in St. 
Louis. “They have a ton of depth in sprints 
and jumps,” Titus said. “At indoor UAAs, 
we tied for second place and we don’t even 
have an indoor track.”
One of Titus’ most memorable moments 
on the track was running the 4x400 meter 
relay. “I had a rough day, I had bombed the 
60- and 200-dash, coach decided that I was 
going to run in the 4x400 relay, and that I 
was going to be the anchor and I don’t usu-
ally run relays, so I was freaking out; it all 
worked out in the end. Doug O’Connell, 
Ben Nealey, and Mike Standish took second 
place,” Titus said.
Titus and the track and ?eld team have 
had a lot of fun together. “One time in the 
shower, Ben saw a cockroach and shrieked. 
Then the cold water came on and he 
shrieked again,” Titus said, laughing.
Titus ?nds a great deal of support from 
his teammates. “Success is dependent 
on all the people who don’t compete, be-
cause I wouldn’t be able to motivate myself 
through all of the workouts without all of 
my teammates,” Titus said.
“Noel is one of the athletes on the team 
that everyone knows they can count on 
to come through in a pretty wide range of 
events when the pressure’s on. It’s great to 
have that sort of presence and leadership 
out of a junior,” said senior chemical and 
biomedical engineering major and team-
mate Robert Morhard.

92 YEARS OF ENGINEERING & ATHLETIC EXCELLENCE
@cmu_buggy
COMPUBOOKIE
Special to The Tartan
Here we go, Buggy lov-
ers: It’s that time of the year 
again. Spring is in the air and 
that means Carnival is right 
around the corner, so let’s 
make some predictions, shall 
we?
The same number of teams  
as last year are out there, but 
we have two new additions 
and two organizations no lon-
ger running. An upstart group 
of ?rst-years and a fraternity/
sorority combo replace two 
dying organizations, each 
hoping to put on a good show 
in their ?rst sweepstakes race. 
With fewer newly-built bug-
gies this year, free rolls have 
featured a bounty of opportu-
nities for the returning teams 
to perfect their lines, which 
will make for one of the clos-
est contested races in recent 
memory. Let’s get on with it.
On the women’s side, I’m 
expecting more of the same. 
Rounding out the bottom 
of the pack will be PiKA’s A 
team, with their progressively 
slower push teams. Finishing 
slightly ahead will be Sig Ep 
A and SDC B. SPIRIT’s women 
pushers have looked impres-
sive during rolls and as long 
as their troubling mechanical 
issues don’t show up on race-
day, I’m predicting a third-
place ?nish. Fringe’s down-
hill times will prove to be too 
much for SPIRIT women to 
overcome. Fringe A will take 
second place, however, as this 
race has turned into SDC A 
against the clock. With supe-
rior pushers and a top-of-the-
line buggy, the SDC women 
will once again take home the 
title.
Moving on to the men’s 
races, I’m predicting a more 
tightly contested race than 
that of last year. Making the 
?nal cut in to Day 2 will be a 
surprising Sigma Nu, whose 
downhill times have been im-
pressive and will make up for a 
group of slower-than-average 
pushers. Next, we will see a 
pair of B teams in PiKA and 
Fringe, who will simply be 
looking to provide insurance 
for their respective A teams. 
Barring any sort of issue in 
the Chute, the ?rst of SDC’s 
three Day 2 teams will look to 
?nish slightly ahead of Fringe 
B. Coming in at sixth place, we 
will see our ?rst A team. Sig 
Ep A will rely on their group 
of strong and fast pushers 
to overcome a slower buggy. 
With spinouts looking like less 
and less of an issue at rolls, 
expect a very competitive race 
from SPIRIT’s A team, push-
ing them into a ?fth-place ?n-
ish. PiKA A will try to rebound 
from a disquali?cation and a 
half-year absence, but will fall 
short once again and end up 
in fourth. The top two orga-
nizations will again compete 
for the three most important 
trophies.
Both Fringe and SDC have 
consistently put up the top 
times at rolls and each has 
looked ef?cient on the hills. 
However, with ample time to 
practice without the added 
commitment of testing a new 
buggy, I expect SDC to run 
cleaner races and eliminate 
mistakes that have plagued 
them in the past. Fringe A will 
fall back to Earth after a two-
year reign and ?nish third to 
SDC B and SDC A.
That’s all for me, folks. 
Good luck to all the teams. I 
will see you out on raceday, 
but you won’t ever see me.

Men’s tennis ?nishes 2–1
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
After the match was origi-
nally postponed due to rain, 
the men’s tennis team took 
the court on Thursday against 
the Grove City College Wol-
verines. The Tartans swept 
the Wolverines with a 9–0 
win. This win brought the 
Tartans to 11–5 overall for the 
season.
Even with senior captain 
Jeremy King out due to injury, 
the Tartans swept doubles. 
At No. 1 doubles, ?rst-years 
Christian Heaney-Secord and 
William Duncan won 8–4, 
while the No. 2 duo of ?rst-
year Thomas Cooper and 
sophomore Julian Pearlman 
won 8–2. At No. 3 doubles, 
?rst-years Vinit Palayekar and 
Roshan Sriram ground out a 
doubles win in a tiebreaker 
9–8 (7–2).
In singles play, the Tartans 
took every match in straight 
sets.
“It was a great match that 
gave some guys a chance to 
play that usually don’t,” Pearl-
man said.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
travelled to Grandville, Ohio, 
to take on the Denison Uni-
versity Big Red. The Tartans, 
currently ranked No. 13, de-
feated Denison, which stood 
at No. 29. The Tartans fought 
hard for their 5–4 victory.
In doubles, despite King’s 
absence, the Tartans took 
the lead 2–1 with 8–4 wins 
from the No. 1 pair of junior 
Duke Miller and Duncan. The 
Tartans also got a 8–2 win 
at No. 3 doubles from ?rst-
years Bryce Beisswanger and 
Heaney-Secord.
The battle continued in 
singles as Duncan grabbed a 
point for the Tartans with a 
6–2, 6–3 win at No. 3 singles. 
Junior Harsha Rao pulled 
out a three-set victory at No. 
4 singles with 6–4, 2–6, 6–1. 
The ?fth win to clinch the 
victory came from Heaney-
Secord in straight sets, both 
decided by a tie break 7–6 
(7–3), 7–6 (8–6).
Yesterday, the men took on 
Johns Hopkins University and 
lost 8–1.

Two of the more interest-
ing personalities of Pittsburgh 
are Mr. and Mrs. Roy Hunt. 
Although neither was born 
in Pittsburgh, each moved 
here early in life and attended 
Pittsburgh schools. The Hunts 
were married on June 11, 
1913, and have four sons.
Mrs. Hunt is a biblio-
phile and horticulturist; she 
has combined these inter-
ests in amassing a library of 
rare books on botany, ?ower 
prints, and original drawings, 
which make up one of the 
most important private collec-
tions in the world.
She is noted as a crafts-
man, artist, hostess, gardener, 
patroness of the arts, and col-
lector. Not content to merely 
collect books, she became a 
bookbinder under the tutelage 
of the celebrated T. J. Cobden-
Sanderson of London. A large 
number of volumes in her li-
brary were bound by her.
Mrs. Hunt
Among her many hon-
ors, Mrs. Hunt received an 
honorary Doctor of Laws de-
gree from the University of 
Pittsburgh in 1954, and the 
honorary degree of Doctor of 
Humane Letters from Carn-
egie Institute of Technology in 
1960. 
She is a charter member 
of the Guild of Book Workers, 
the Limited Editions Club of 
New York, the Herb Society of 
America, and the Garden Club 
of Allegheny County.
She has had numerous ex-
hibitions of selections from 
her collection at art museums 
and universities, and has lec-
tured on bookbinding and 
botanical subjects. The Rachel 
McMasters Miller Hunt Botan-
ical Library, in the penthouse 
surmounting Hunt Library, 
houses Mrs. Hunt’s magni?-
cent collection.
Mr. Hunt
In 1903, Mr. Hunt gradu-
ated with an A.B. degree from 
Yale University and began his 
full-time, life-long career with 
Alcoa. In 1928, he was elected 
president of the company, a 
post he held for 23 years un-
til he was elected chairman of 
the Executive Committee in 
1951.
Mr. Hunt is also director 
of the Mellon National Bank 
and Trust Company, National 
Union Fire Insurance Compa-
ny, and the Pittsburgh Testing 
Laboratory. His active interest 
in education, health, and wel-
fare is re?ected in trusteeships 
with Carnegie Institute, Carn-
egie Institute of Technology, 
Shadyside Academy, Grove 
City College, Elizabeth Steel, 
Magee Hospital, and Pitts-
burgh Skin and Cancer Foun-
dation. Mr. Hunt is a member 
of numerous clubs and asso-
ciations both here and in New 
York.
In 1943, Mr. Hunt received 
the American Society for Met-
als medal for advancement of 
research; in 1944, an honor-
ary Doctor of Law degree from 
the University of Pittsburgh; 
and in 1953, a similar degree 
from Oberlin College.
On October 29, 1958, 
Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology announced a gift of 
$2,800,000 from Mr. and Mrs. 
Hunt for construction of a new 
campus library. Ground was 
broken in the fall of 1959.

Every year on Tech’s cam-
pus and on campuses all over 
the country, Alpha Phi Omega 
chapters sponsor a unique 
service project — the Ugliest 
Man on Campus contest. 
Instead of deciding which 
girl is the prettiest on campus, 
this selection will determine 
the ugliest male. 
Anyone possessing the fol-
lowing three quali?cations 
is eligible to enter UMOC: he 
must be a male, he must be a 
Tech student, and he must be 
ugly. To preserve some de-
gree of competition, faculty 
members have been declared  
ineligible.
Any student organization 
wishing to enter a candidate 
must submit its name into 
UMOC, Box 282 campus mail 
before noon April 7. If you 
can’t seem to ?nd an ugly 
member in your organization, 
why not look in the mirror? 
Then talk one of your friends 
into running before he real-
izes that you would make the 
best choice. Pictures will be 
taken by Alpha Phi Omega on 
April 14. Ballot box stuf?ng 
will not be tolerated; rather, it 
will be encouraged. 
Everyone will be permitted 
to vote as often as he wishes 
at the cost of 1 cent per vote.  
This makes it possible for 
those who are always at their 
wits’ end deciding whom 
to vote for in the numerous 
queen elections to split their 
votes. 
The proceeds will be given 
to Campus Chest to be dis-
tributed to worthy charities. 
A large number of candi-
dates strongly supported by  
their sponsoring organizations 
will result in an enthusiastic 
and generous support by the  
voters.

APRIL 4, 1962
The Constitution Commit-
tee of Student Congress was 
formed to continually study 
the constitution of Tech’s stu-
dent government, to keep it 
up-to-date and practical.
The constitution itself de-
?nes the various branches of 
student government and out-
lines their duties and pow-
ers. All students and student 
organizations are subordi-
nate to this student govern-
ment which the constitution 
de?nes. Such an important 
and powerful document must 
be carefully studied and re-
vised to make sure that the 
student government works 
for the student body and not  
against it.
The Constitution com-
mittee is Congress’ method 
of accomplishing this. Each 
year, its members investigate 
the constitution for clarity 
and practicability and recom-
mend changes to Congress 
where necessary. 
Occasionally a major 
change in Student Govern-
ment is recommended and 
instituted, such as the new 
court system, which was es-
tablished two years ago.
One of the duties of this 
year’s committee is to study 
this court system, now that 
it has been effect for a year, 
and revise the provisions 
which have been found to be 
impractical. Present mem-
bers of this year’s committee 
include Mark Applebaum, 
Ralph Debussman, Marilyn 
Miller, John Mowry, Paul 
Pheneger, and the chairman, 
Jane Scott.

FEBRUARY 14, 1962
Richard M. Cyert has been 
appointed dean of the Gradu-
ate School of Industrial Ad-
ministration and William R. 
Dill appointed as associate 
dean. The appointments be-
came effective February 1.
Professor Cyert has been 
at Carnegie Tech since 1948. 
He is currently professor of 
industrial administration and 
head of the department of in-
dustrial management.
Commenting on his ap-
pointment, Dr. Warner said, 
“It is fortunate for Carnegie 
Tech that a man such as Pro-
fessor Cyert is available to 
continue the ?ne work done 
by Dean Bach. Professor Cy-
ert has been on the faculty 
of the Graduate School of In-
dustrial Administration since 
its founding and has con-
tributed much to its unique 
success. I feel certain that 
the school, under him, will 
continue the growth which 
has placed it among the ?n-
est business schools in the 
country.”
Professor Cyert received 
his B.S. degree from the 
University of Minnesota and 
his Ph.D. from Columbia  
University.
Background
He has been director of a 
large scale research project, 
“Behavioral Theory of the 
Firm,” sponsored by the Ford 
Foundation, which is consid-
ered to be the ?rst of its kind 
employing an electronic com-
puter as a simulation device 
in economics. As a result of 
his research, he expects to 
publish three books this year: 
A Behavioral Theory of the 
Firm, with J. G. March, Mar-
ket Structures and the Theory 
of the Firm, with K. J. Cohen, 
and Quantitative Techniques 
in Accounting, with H. Justin 
Davidson. All of the books 
will be published by Prentice-
Hall.
Professor Cyert was re-
cently elected vice president 
in charge of research and 
education of the Institute of 
Management Sciences and is 
chairman of the Institute's re-
search committee. 
He is widely known among 
accountants and auditors as 
“one of the few theoretical 
statisticians who has enough 
understanding of counting 
to place statistics in practical 
application in our ?elds.”
Professor Cyert is a consul-
tant the federal government, 
the Gulf Oil Corporation, 
and for the accounting ?rm 
of Touche, Ross, Bailey and 
Smart. He was the organizer 
of the original group devel-
oping the Carnegie Manag-
ment Game, which has been 
an unquali?ed success. He 
has written many articles in 
leading journals in the ?elds 
of economics, accounting, 
statistics, and management, 
and is co-author of Sampling 
Techniques in Accounting, 
Prentice-Hall, 1957.
Professor Dill
Professor Dill has been at 
Carnegie Tech since 1955. He 
received his B.A. degree from 
Bates College and his M.S. 
and Ph.D. degrees from Carn-
egie Tech. Since 1959, he has 
been assistant dean of the 
Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration.
He has written articles in 
many professional journals 
and a book, Managerial De-
cision Making, published by 
University of Chicago Indus-
trial Relations Center.
At Carnegie, his main 
interests have been in the 
Management Game and in 
studying the application of 
the behavioral sciences ad-
ministrative processes.
Richard Cyert appointed new Dean of GSIA

OCTOBER 18, 1961
If any Tech man is think-
ing of invading Morewood 
Gardens via the heating sys-
tem tunnels, he had better 
give up on the idea unless 
he’s prepared to do a large 
amount of digging. There just 
aren’t any tunnels leading 
into Morewood from any spot 
on the campus.
Have you ever wondered 
why the air above the vent 
across the street from En-
gineering Hall is so warm? 
Have you ever noticed that 
the snow is always melting 
in front of EH? The answer to 
these questions lies in Carn-
egie Tech’s heating system.
Duct Locations
Tech’s central heating 
plant is located in Machinery 
Hall on the west end of cam-
pus. A walk-through tunnel 
connects this plant with the 
Gym and Margaret Morrison. 
Within this tunnel there are 
pipes carrying steam at pres-
sures of 50 and 100 pounds 
per square inch, a hot wa-
ter pipe, and condensate 
ducts. The 100-pound pipe 
branches off into EH, where 
the pressure is reduced. It 
then continues on to heat the 
Faculty Club and the Coal Re-
search Lab.
The 50-pound duct leads 
straight under the Fine Arts 
buildings, where it branches 
off into two directions. 
One branch goes directly 
into the Library and GSIA, 
while the other contin-
ues ahead until it branches 
into the Gym and MMCC.  
The MMCC branch divides 
into two sections, one which 
heats the grad dorms and the 
other which heats Donner 
Hall, the men’s dorms, and 
the houses along the west 
side of Margaret Morrison 
Street. 
There are condensate 
tanks located at four spots on 
campus where water collects, 
to be returned to Machinery 
Hall. A hotwater pipe in the 
tunnel serves AH, FA, EH, 
and MMCC.
Electrical Systems
The school electrical sys-
tem follows much the same 
pattern as the heating sys-
tem. It was installed in 1950 
at a cost of $200,000. The 
system converts a 22,000-
volt current into usable AC 
and DC sources and outlets.
Extensions of the power 
system have been proposed 
to cross the cut and enter 
Morewood Gardens. It is es-
timated that the school could 
save at least $4,000 per year 
in power bills, but whether or 
not this would offset the cost 
of construction is another 
matter.
Greek Sing consists of song and dance
MARCH 14, 1962
Tech’s annual Greek Sing 
Weekend will be held this 
coming weekend, March 16th 
and 17th. Greek Sing, the 
sorority and fraternity com-
petition, will be held Friday, 
March 16th, at 8:00 p.m. in 
the Carnegie Music Hall. 
Greek Swing, a semi-for-
mal dance, will be held Sat-
urday, March 17th from 9:00 
p.m. till 12:30 a.m. in Tech’s 
gym with music by Walt 
Harper’s Band.
Co-chairman for the 
weekend are Sue Weishauss, 
Alpha Epsilon Phi, and Phil 
Andrew, Delta Upsilon. Deco-
rations for the dance are be-
ing taken care of by Linda 
Cover and Bobby Wordtt, 
Chi Omega; and all sorority 
pledges are to help put up the 
decorations.
The seven judges for the 
competition have already 
been given music that each 
group will sing. This music is 
prejudged for dif?culty, mu-
sical worth, and quality. 
On Friday evening each 
group will be judged for inter-
pretation and performance 
(intonation and diction). In 
addition to the sororities and 
fraternities, Sigma Alpha Iota 
and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia 
will perform.
On Saturday evening at 
11:15 p.m., the ?rst, second, 
and third place winners of 
both the fraternity and soror-
ity competition will be an-
nounced and trophies will be 
awarded. At that time the so-
rority and fraternity scholar-
ship trophy winners will also 
be announced.
If you can’t 
seem to 
?nd an ugly 
member in your 
organization, 
why not look in 
the mirror?

Carnival to feature paper airplanes
Mosque bans CMU concerts
Manager claims layout of CMU 
bookstore invites shopliftingPolitical group outlines platform 
Science Hall offers centralized location
APRIL 11, 1972
The 1972 Spring Carnival 
paper airplane contest will be 
held on Saturday, April 22, 
at 2:00 p.m. in the gym. The 
contest is open to Carnegie 
Mellon students, faculty, and 
staff.
Construction: Acceptable 
materials in the construc-
tion of airplanes are paper, 
glue, and tape. There is no 
minimum or maximum size 
requirement. All entries must 
“?y,” i.e., if the judges decide 
that a plane’s ?ight is due 
solely to the initial propul-
sion, it will be disquali?ed. 
The only source of propul-
sion is to be the hand(s) of 
the pilot(s). There are four 
categories of competition. All 
entries will be launched from 
the stage. Materials will be 
supplied at the gym.
1. Accuracy: Contestants 
will be allowed to choose 
any target distance greater 
than or equal to 25'. The con-
testant will then throw his 
or her one entry twice from 
the stage. Score is computed 
as the sum of the distances 
of the nose of the plane to 
the target post. The lowest 
score wins. Measurements 
will be made to the nearest  
half-inch.
2. Time Duration: Contes-
tants attempt to achieve the 
greatest airborne time. Time 
is de?ned as the sum of time 
durations, from release to 
complete stop, of two ?ights. 
Planes with glide-parachutes 
and other similar devices are 
not eligible.
3. Acrobatics: Contestants 
will try to put on the best ac-
robatic show. The decision of 
the judges will be qualitative 
and ?nal. One try per entrant.
4. Distance: Contestants 
attempt to achieve the great-
est travel distance as mea-
sured perpendicular to the 
stage front. The score will be 
the sum of two ?ights. The 
highest score wins.
Contestants may enter as 
many events as they wish but 
may make only one entry in 
each event. Five dollar prizes 
will be awarded to the win-
ner of each event. However, a 
contestant is only eligible for 
one prize.
OCTOBER 21, 1971
As a result of last Friday 
night’s Allman Brothers con-
cert, the management of the 
Syria Mosque has banned 
any further Carnegie Mellon-
sponsored major rock con-
certs from that hall. Conse-
quently, it is doubtful that the 
Activities Board will be able 
to sponsor any major concerts 
after the upcoming Virgil Fox/
Pablo's Lights concert.
The Allman Brothers 
concert was stormed by 
approximately 400 gate 
crashers. The crowd was 
informed that no more seats 
were available. A few left; 
the rest tried to enter illegally 
by breaking windows and 
removing window frames, 
or by charging the doors. 
One door was broken off its 
hinges. Some ticket holders 
opened doors from the inside 
for the gate crashers.
The Activities Board had 
hired six off-duty policemen 
for crowd control. But eventu-
ally, 48 Pittsburgh policemen 
were called to the scene.
After the concert began, 
the police surrounded the 
theater to cover all entrances. 
But the gate crashers persis-
tently circled the building 
until they could ?nd a weak 
spot in the police line through 
which to charge a door.
The police refused to dis-
perse the crowd until a law 
was broken and an of?cial 
complaint ?led. Half an hour 
after the concert started they 
cleared the streets by threat-
ening with billy clubs and 
dogs. 
No one was hurt or 
arrested, however, and most 
of the ticket holders inside 
the Mosque were not aware 
that anything irregular was 
happening.
The management of the 
Mosque blames Carnegie 
Mellon on two counts, even 
though the majority of gate 
crashers were not from the 
University. It claims the Activ-
ities Board should have hired 
more security, and that the 
concert should not have been 
advertised off campus.
The off-campus publicity 
consisted of an ad in the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh news-
paper and one radio spot on 
WDVE-FM.
A similar, though less se-
rious, incident occurred last 
spring at the Carnegie Mu-
sic Hall when the Activities 
Board presented B. B. King. 
The management of the Mu-
sic Hall used minor incidents 
as an excuse to ban future 
Carnegie Mellon rock con-
certs from that hall.
Even if Friday night’s ?-
asco had been minor, it would 
have been suf?cient cause to 
the Mosque for the banning 
of future rock concerts. Its 
employees are accustomed 
to nothing but ballet, sym-
phony, and opera crowds, and 
were overwhelmed by the 
frantic efforts of rock fans to  
enter for free. 
One 20-year veteran tick-
et-taker had his eyeglasses 
shattered and lost his hear-
ing aid when approximately 
20 youths hurled themselves 
through the door where he 
was stationed.
Before the evening was 
over, all the ushers had walked 
out. The light and sound tech-
nicians, who were under con-
tract to work until 11:30 p.m., 
turned the lights on at 11:27. 
The Allman Brothers played a 
3-minute encore.
The concert was described 
as “beautiful” and “a success,” 
except that the sound system 
failed after “Wet Willy,” leav-
ing the Allman Brothers to 
stand on stage for 40 minutes 
before they could begin. The 
sound system broke because 
of many of the gate crashers 
in the aisles were sitting on 
the wires.
With the late start and the 
group’s popularity, the con-
cert would assuredly have 
gone on much longer if the 
lights hadn’t been turned on.
Bill Iacono, director of the 
Activities Board, said, “the il-
licit entry of several hundred 
people, coupled with the ac-
tions of many inside, was un-
fortunate for those of us who 
wish to see future high-cost 
entertainment at reasonable 
ticket prices.”
The Activities Board feels 
that in the future it might con-
?ne itself to lectures, plays, 
?lms, and coffeehouses since 
the problems increase with 
every concert. 
If a person is interested in 
attending rock concerts there 
are several local promoters 
who present, on average, 2 
concerts a week open to any-
one who can afford them at 
$6 to $8 a ticket. And if one 
can’t afford them, he or she 
can crash them which is even 
less expensive than the aver-
age $3 ticket for a Carnegie 
Mellon concert.
“Of course,” Iacono said, 
“this type of crowd reaction 
could jeopardize Skibo Ball-
room activities as well. The 
Activities Board is not willing 
to become a police organiza-
tion.” It is a non-pro?t enter-
tainment organization which 
can no longer ?nancially af-
ford to sponsor rock concerts 
at discounted ticket prices if it 
must contend with the threat 
of vandalism and the extra 
cost of security.
There is now no concert 
hall within easy access to 
Carnegie Mellon in which an 
Activities Board-sponsored 
rock concert can take place.
OCTOBER 28, 1971
According to the manager 
of the Carnegie Mellon book-
store, an estimated 2% to 3% 
of its total sales is stolen. This 
amounts to about $14,000 or 
$15,000 a year.
Mr. Charles Floyd, manag-
er of the bookstore, noted that 
these ?gures have remained 
constant for the last few years 
and that they are no better 
or worse than the reported 
?gures of other on-campus 
bookstores.
Mr. Floyd also noted that 
the biggest dollar loss in sto-
len merchandise is that lost 
on stolen textbooks. He said 
that this was simply because 
textbooks are expensive and 
that every student has to have 
them. Other items frequently 
stolen are ?lm and small, 
hard-to-mark supplies.
When asked if there were 
any ways to stop theft, Mr. 
Floyd said that all he could do 
was keep an alert staff and re-
mind students that strong dis-
ciplinary action will be taken 
against those who are caught.
He mentioned that the 
present layout and location 
of the bookstore invites shop-
lifting, and hopes that when 
the addition to Skibo is built, 
it will include a properly de-
signed bookstore. Losses in 
textbook inventory do not 
now threaten the standard 
10% textbook discount.
Mr. Floyd noted that sev-
eral other campus book-
stores have resorted to over-
the-counter sales in order to 
cut theft rates and maintain 
the 10% textbook discount.  
Carnegie Mellon’s bookstore 
has been self-service since 
1948, and has no plans of go-
ing to over-the-counter sales.
MARCH 21, 1972
After a few years of work-
ing on a hodge-podge of is-
sues with no general focus, 
the Carnegie Mellon Revolu-
tionary Alliance has worked 
out a political perspective 
that will give direction to its 
actions. Included in the per-
spective is:
•	A quick description of the 
fact that most problems 
existing a few years ago, 
when there were more 
massive protests, still ex-
ist, and many have gotten 
worse.
•	An analysis of the short-
comings of past movement 
activities and problems 
that exist with various 
groups, such as alternative 
institutions, muckraking, 
anti-war and anti-repres-
sion groups, and electoral 
groups.
•	An analysis of power in 
America and the connec-
tions of state monopoly 
capitalism with societal 
problems.
•	A discussion of the counter 
culture. How is it progres-
sive or reactionary?
In the near future, the 
Revolutionary Alliance will 
be working on the produc-
tion of a manual for material 
and psychological survival in 
Pittsburgh. It will be partici-
pating in the April 1 Mobiliza-
tion in Harrisburg, to coincide 
with Kissenger Kidnap Con-
spiracy trial and the April 12 
Anti-War Mobilization in New 
York. The Alliance is trying to 
get together groups of radi-
cals from different ?elds, to 
bring the works of alternative 
groups such as the Computer 
People for Peace to the cam-
pus. Finally, the Revolution-
ary Alliance will be dealing 
with campus issues such as 
budget cuts, layoffs, and the 
?ring of politically active fac-
ulty members.
Carnegie Mellon Revolu-
tionary Alliance will be hav-
ing its next meeting Wednes-
day, March 22 in room 56, 
Skibo at 4:30 p.m.
SEPTEMBER 16, 1971
“There are more and better 
facilities here than were avail-
able at Scaife Hall,” observed 
Harry Rowell, Assistant Direc-
tor of the Computation Cen-
ter about that center. But he 
might just as well have been 
speaking of Science Hall, the 
newly opened building that 
houses the Computation Cen-
ter.
Located directly behind 
Doherty Hall, Science Hall 
makes for an imposing new 
structure on campus. Entering 
through the main entrance 
(onto the ?fth ?oor, oddly 
enough) one is immediately 
and agreeably impressed. 
My initial impression was 
that, unlike most buildings 
located on the Carnegie  
Mellon campus, this one has a  
pleasant, even cheerful, 
atmosphere. 
But on further examina-
tion one can’t keep a slight 
negative note from infringing. 
After a while, gray concrete 
becomes monotonous and a 
general feeling of drabness 
encroaches.
Science Hall does have 
some important advantages 
in its favor. First, and most 
obvious because of its very 
size, there is far more space 
for everything. Classrooms 
are larger. Staff members can  
now be allotted of?ce space. 
There is even room for a mini-
library devoted to scienti?c 
and technical materials. Three 
elevators take students from 
?oor to ?oor, and various 
small but comfortable lounges 
are available for the students 
convenience.
The building’s biggest plus, 
though, is its location. Unlike 
Scaife Hall, which housed 
many of the features, particu-
larly the Computation Center 
now incorporated in Science 
Hall, the new eight-story 
building is more centrally lo-
cated and far more accessible 
to the students who will use it.
Science Hall is open 
around the clock for anyone 
wishing to take advantage of 
its facilities. The building is 
still not completed, as some 
minor touches are yet to be 
added.

OCTOBER 21, 1971
Three University of Pitts-
burgh students have been 
charged with the shotgun 
robbery of a Carnegie Mellon 
student in his dormitory room 
last Monday afternoon.
James Schmidhammer, of 
111 Scobell Hall, was beaten, 
bound, and robbed of $40. He 
was taken to Shadyside Hos-
pital, where he received six 
stitches in his face.
Two of the suspects were 
apprehended by CMU Securi-
ty Of?cers immediately after 
the crime. The third suspect 
was arrested at his home two 
hours later by city police.
According to the police, 
the suspects carried the long-
barrelled, 12-gauge shotgun 
to Schmidhammer’s room in a 
guitar case.
Schmidhammer told secu-
rity that he was lying on his 
bed when he heard a knock 
on his door. 
Opening the door, he saw 
three masked people, and was 
immediately punched with 
brass knuckles in the left side 
of his face.
The punch knocked 
Schmidhammer to the ?oor, 
and the suspects proceeded to 
cover his mouth and eyes with 
adhesive tape, and to bind his 
wrists, knees, and ankles. 
Before his eyes were taped, 
Schmidhammer noticed a 
small revolver in the hand of 
one of the suspects.
His next contact with the 
revolver came when it was put 
up to his chin. One of them 
asked him where his money 
was. He told them it was in his 
wallet, which they took from 
his back pocket; then they 
ransacked his room.
Schmidhammer’s neigh-
bor, Jack Cohen, had become 
suspicious when he heard the 
door slammed shut, and put 
a glass up to the wall to listen 
inside. Convinced that there 
was trouble, he tried to phone 
Security. But failing to get 
through by the school switch-
board, he told some other 
residents about the trouble 
and went outside to ?nd a Se-
curity van.
Security alerted the city 
police and proceeded to  
Scobell Hall. Dorm residents 
began knocking on Schmid-
hammer’s door and calling 
his nickname, “Schmitty.” 
When there was no answer 
they knocked and called more 
loudly a second time.
The suspects went to the 
window to escape. As they 
jumped from the window, Se-
curity Director Taylor entered 
the room and found Schmid-
hammer. When the suspects 
landed, they found Security  
Coordinator Fred Schoettle. 
One was holding the revolver, 
and as he turned to Schoettle, 
Schoettle knocked the loaded 
revolver from his hand and 
put him under arrest.
The other two suspects 
?ed, one with the shotgun. 
The unarmed suspect was 
chased by students across 
Margaret Morrison Street, 
behind Donner Hall, to Devon 
Road where, exhausted, 
he was arrested by three 
Security Of?cers who had 
been noti?ed by radio that he 
was coming.
The armed suspect 
remained at large until his 
companions gave police his 
home address, where he was 
arrested two hours later.
The shotgun and the brass 
knuckles were found at the 
rear of Woodlawn Terrace.
The guitar case, which was 
left in the room, was found 
to contain one tire iron, one 
club, one hunting knife, and 
four shotgun shells. Com-
menting on all the equipment, 
Director Taylor said, “the sus-
pects have been watching too 
much TV.”
Each suspect has been 
charged with burglary, armed 
robbery, and assault and 
battery, and one suspect has 
additionally been charged 
with larceny for stealing the 
revolver. Taylor says there is a 
good chance each will get off.
City police detained 
Schmidhammer on suspicion 
of narcotics found in his room, 
but tests on the items proved 
negative and Schmidhammer 
was sent back to CMU with a 
clean record.
Student robbed at gunpoint, three assailants arrested
The biggest 
dollar loss 
in stolen 
merchandise 
is that lost 
on stolen 
textbooks.
The punch 
knocked 
Schmidhammer 
to the ?oor, and 
the suspects 
proceeded to 
cover his mouth 
and eyes with 
adhesive tape, 
and to bind his 
wrists, knees, 
and ankles.

Kiltie Band nominated ‘Best Dressed’ for plaid uniforms
NOVEMBER 3, 1981
They’re at football games, 
concerts, and graduation, 
rain or shine. They are a big 
part of the ambiance and at-
mosphere of Carnegie Mellon 
University: the Kiltie Band. 
The band has been a part 
of this university since the 
1920s, but was only recently 
restarted four years ago after 
a 10 year absence.
The band consists of vol-
unteers, generally non-music 
majors. Christine Kretz, a se-
nior art major, is president of 
the band. “The band is a mu-
sical outlet for the students 
of CMU,” Kretz said. “When 
you leave high school if you’re 
not a music major, you pretty 
much forfeit all of your musi-
cal activity. It’s a social thing 
— it’s a lot of fun.”
This year the band was 
given new uniforms by the 
Alumni Association. They 
were custom made in the 
Carnegie plaid with fabric 
from Scotland. The Kiltie 
Band has been nominated for 
the best dressed band award, 
collegiate division, by the uni-
form manufacturers.
The band’s shows are writ-
ten by the music director, 
Warren Mercer, an alumnus 
currently directing music 
groups and bands at Carn-
egie Mellon University and 
North Hills High School. The 
administration of the band’s 
activities is “totally run by stu-
dents,” Kretz said.
There are two phases to 
the Kiltie Band’s musical 
season: football games and 
the concert shows. The band 
plays one or two concerts a 
year and also plays at gradu-
ation. Band practices are on 
Monday and Wednesday af-
ternoons and before games on 
Saturdays. The main recruit-
ment that the band employs 
is an interest poll sent out to 
incoming ?rst-years.
“Our idea is not that we 
go out there and look like 
the big blue band from Penn 
State or the Buckeye Band 
or anything else,” Kretz 
commented. “We’re just a 
different sort of band. We like 
to march the best we can but 
we like to sound good. There’s 
something about going to a 
football game and being in the 
marching band that makes it 
all worthwhile.”
NOVEMBER 17, 1981
Rarely can a person walk 
past The Original Hot Dog 
Shop in Oakland when it’s 
not busy. The Big O, as it is 
more frequently called, has 
been a favorite “hang-out” 
of Pittsburgh’s college crowd 
for many years now. “And the 
business seems to be growing 
more and more every year,” 
owner Sydney Simon said.
Simon, a Pittsburgh na-
tive, began the business in 
May 1960 along with his 
brother and partner, Mor-
ris Simon. Sidney had been 
working as a manager for 
fastfood restaurants before 
beginning The Big O. “If I can 
do it for them, I can do it for 
myself,” he said about decid-
ing to start his business.
At that time, the Pitts-
burgh Pirates played Forbes 
Field and the team was ad-
vancing very well. The Si-
mons thought that a new hot 
dog shop to accommodate 
the crowds in the area would 
be “just a natural.”
“We started on a tooth-
pick,” Simon said. “We didn’t 
even have enough money to 
buy an exhaust fan. It was 
a struggle to open up.” The 
brothers employed only three 
other people and together, by 
working 10 to 15 hours each 
they kept the shop open ev-
ery day, 24 hours a day. Now 
the shop employs approxi-
mately 43 people and Simon 
has cut back his own hours to 
two or three a day.
Simon attributes his suc-
cess of The Big O to “the qual-
ity product we give. Every-
thing in this place is quality.” 
The Original is one of the few 
places to still offer hot dogs 
with natural casing rather 
than protein casing, which 
Simon considers to “dry up” 
the natural juices. Because 
no one else offered this kind 
of hot dog, the brothers de-
cided to name the shop, “The 
Original.”
Over the 22 years he has 
been in the business, Simon 
does not believe that “col-
lege kids” have changed that 
much. 
Some graduates who 
used to frequent The O have 
“come back as doctors and 
lawyers, and I recognize a lot 
of them,” Simon said. A few 
have even called him asking 
for advice and assistance on 
how to open up their own 
places.
“If you work hard, put in a 
lot of time, you can make it,” 
Simon said about business. 
An average person without 
money or a college education 
holding on to the American 
dream “can make it. That 
only happens in this country.”
The Original: An Oakland tradition
OCTOBER 27, 1981
Dr. Richard Cyert, former 
dean of Graduate School of 
Industrial Administration, has 
been president of Carnegie 
Mellon University since 1972. 
Cyert, a respected economist, 
became president when the 
University was in severe ?nan-
cial trouble; today Carnegie 
Mellon University has a very 
strong ?nancial base and solid 
educational programs. Yet 
questions exist about the Uni-
versity’s physical condition, 
education philosophy, and 
research programs. Tartan 
editor Bob Leighty recently 
interviewed Cyert about his 
present and future plans for 
Carnegie Mellon University.
Tartan: At homecoming, you 
talked a lot about the ?nan-
cial state of the university. 
How serious were problems 
in the past, and what steps 
were taken to solve these 
problems? Also, how do we 
look as far as the future?
Cyert: Well, when I became 
president in 1972, the univer-
sity had just had three years 
of serious de?cits. Perhaps 
the total change in the ?nan-
cial condition can be sum-
marized by the two ?gures in 
?scal year ending 1972 which 
ended June 30. The university 
spent $796,000 on capital and 
it had a de?cit of something 
around $1.3 million. In ?scal 
year ending 1981, 9 years lat-
er, we spent over $ 12 million 
dollars on capital, and we had 
a surplus of $72,000. 
So that shows the progress 
that we’ve made; basically 
what we’ve done is to try to 
get better control over our 
budgets. In other words, when 
a college is given a budget, we 
have review quarterly to try 
to make sure that they live up 
to those budgets. When they 
are over their budget, we ask 
them to come up with some 
rule or some actions that are 
gonna bring it back into bal-
ance. 
Perhaps the biggest change 
that we made was to change 
the budgeting procedure. We 
start making an estimate of 
our income about a year and 
a half in advance. In other 
words, last August, we esti-
mated how much income we 
were gonna have by 1983, 
and we just sent out in Octo-
ber a letter to the deans telling 
them how much money they 
have to spend for their bud-
gets. So basically, with that, 
if we get budgets that are in 
balance and if we can manage 
to make sure that people live 
within their budgets, we have 
control on them.
Tartan: Why was it necessary 
for the tuition to rise so fast, so 
much?
Cyert: I would say that there 
has been a pretty signi?cant 
in?ation. That’s one factor. 
Secondly, we are trying to 
catch up in salaries with our 
faculty, and tuition doesn’t 
quite pay for instruction cost. 
In other words, when you 
take our tuition, total tuition 
income was something in the 
neighbor of $27 million. That’s 
graduate and undergradu-
ate. We take 10 percent of the 
undergraduate tuition out 
for ?nancial aid. So let’s say  
that the undergraduate tu-
ition income was somewhere 
around $23 million, and take 
that 10 percent out. The total 
instruction cost was some-
thing over $27 million, about 
$600,000 over. And that’s 
including all our faculty’s  
salaries. 
We are trying to increase 
our faculty salaries at a sig-
ni?cant pace, and we’d like 
our tuition to approximate our 
instruction cost, so in a sense, 
a good deal of the tuition in-
crease goes either into student 
aid or into faculty salaries. 
The endowment income and 
our overhead for research are 
going to others like support 
services, libraries, ....
Tartan: What about student 
services? I noticed hear-
ing some talk about need-
ing a student union here 
and things like that. Do you 
feel enough money has been 
spent on student services?
Cyert: Well I would like to 
see more student services and 
student facilities. We did add 
another major person to the 
student affairs this year: Brad 
Walters. But I recognized that 
in many respects that Skibo is 
inadequate as a student union. 
And we are looking hard at 
that; we’re looking at some 
plans that had been made for 
the extension of Skibo back 
in the late ’60s. They were 
supposed to pay an architect, 
because there are some plans 
there. But they were never 
able to raise the money to 
do it. I’d like to look at that. 
I’d like to get a ?eld house 
which I think would be good 
for faculty and students, and 
modern recreational facilities.
Tartan: One of the other 
things that people have 
talked about lately is hous-
ing. What are your thoughts 
concerning the short term 
and the long term housing 
problems we’ve been having?
Cyert: Well, for the short 
term, I’ve asked Oscar Mayer 
to look for an apartment that 
we can rent; I don’t want 
to be in the position where 
we kick upperclassmen out. 
I would hope that most of 
them would choose to live in 
some of these outlying dorms, 
but they would be in campus 
housing so they wouldn’t be 
thrown out to the mercies of 
the community. I also want 
to have enough housing so 
we can house more gradu-
ate students. We’ve had some 
bad experiences, apparently, 
particularly with minority 
students — minority graduate 
students. So I would like to be 
able to take care of that. We’re 
starting to work on it now and 
we’re fairly con?dent that we 
will be able to solve that.
For the longer term we 
want to add another dorm. 
We’ve made an application to 
HUD. They have a new pro-
gram out and we’re asking 
for $3.5 million. We’d have to 
put $3.5 million of our own 
money in as well, or raise $3.5 
million. I think we can build 
a really nice dorm between 
Mudge and Morewood.
Cyert speaks on CMU’s ?nancial stateContent of new CS degree discussed
FEBRUARY 16, 1982
Tentative planning is cur-
rently in progress for an un-
dergraduate computer sci-
ence major.
A group of six Computer 
Science faculty, headed by Dr. 
Mary Shaw, is establishing 
what would be the content of 
such a program. Once it has 
been decided what direction 
the ?eld and the department 
are headed, courses will be 
laid out. At this point, “We 
will decide whether or not 
we should offer a degree,”  
Shaw says. It is not even cer-
tain whether a B.S. or a M.S. 
degree will result. “Right 
now we have the best Ph.D. 
program in the country and 
if we offer an undergraduate 
degree, we'll be dealing with 
the same quality.” Any new 
degree will probably not dif-
fer radically from what is al-
ready in place with the Math-
Computer Science option.
The department has also 
recently made curriculum 
changes, which will be pub-
lished in the new undergrad-
uate catalog. Chief among 
the changes will be the elimi-
nation of 15-311 Software 
Engineering and 15-330 
Computer Simulation and 
Modeling Techniques. Most 
of the material in 311 will 
now be taught as 15-413. 15-
200, Advanced Programming 
Methods, has also undergone 
a major face-lift.
Isaac Asimov predicts future of housing and computers
SEPTEMBER 15, 1981
Isaac Asimov is respected 
as a science ?ction writer —  
he has written 234 books —  
and as a scientist. He received 
a Ph.D. from Columbia Uni-
versity and is a professor of 
biochemistry at Boston Uni-
versity’s School of Medicine. 
He is currently writing a  
novel, several scienti?c  
books, and numerous other 
projects. Asimov is very in-
terested in research and has 
many ideas about the future. 
Tartan editor Bob Leighty in-
terviewed Asimov asking him 
about the world decades from 
now. 
Tartan: Keeping in mind some 
of the changes in energy and 
just some of the other things 
that are happening with our 
own population and such, 
what do you think will be the 
future kinds of homes we will 
be having, the future kinds 
of cars we will be having?
Asimov: I look forward some-
how to a decentralized ... one 
in which the huge conglom-
erations of population won’t 
be so necessary anymore. 
The tendency to decen-
tralize will be a conse-
quence of electronic com-
munication of all kinds.
More and more we’re go-
ing to be able to do our work 
from our own homes and 
more and more it won’t be 
so necessary to travel around 
because we will get all the in-
formation we need and exert 
all the control and regula-
tion we need electronically. 
I personally think that 
there is a lot to be said for 
moving underground. If 
we can build our homes 
underground we’re really 
independent of the weather. 
As a result, in fact, the only 
natural catastrophe that can 
harm us underground are 
earthquakes. Nothing much 
we can do about that. And 
in that way we will get our 
weight off the Earth itself, 
leave the Earth to farms, 
parks, roominess; and make it 
easier and happier for human 
beings.
Tartan: One of the things you 
have just touched upon there, 
when you said about the de-
centralization, was comput-
ers. What kind of changes do 
you think personal computers 
are going to be making in our 
lives in the next few years?
Asimov: I imagine that, as 
homes become computer-
ized, schools will be more 
a way of guiding people 
through self-education than 
anything else; and this is the 
best thing schools can do 
because as long as school is 
considered a force for actual 
education, you’ll have people 
in relatively large classes, all 
of them studying the same 
subjects at the same speed. 
It’s a kind of mashing to-
gether of all kinds of different 
people with different per-
sonalities, different brains, 
different temperaments into 
the same mold, and very few 
people ?t it. 
If we all were forced to 
wear one size and one shape 
and one fashion of shoe, there 
would be feet that ?t in that 
particular shoe and almost 
everybody would have aching 
feet. 
And right now we’ve got 
very few people who just hap-
pen to ?t into the curriculum 
of the schools, and we have 
very many kids with aching 
brains, so to speak.
But if schools are a way 
of getting people together 
so they can talk about what 
interests them and so they 
could be guided in the direc-
tions they might want to go 
and then do a great deal of 
their work at home with their 
computers, that would be like 
having everybody with shoes 
with measure. And then we 
might have very few people 
with aching feet and very 
few kids with aching brains.

SEPTEMBER 9, 1991
Walter Cathie has an im-
age problem. As associate 
vice president for ?nancial 
resources, Cathie knows that 
many students place the Of-
?ce of Financial Aid on a level 
about even with the Internal 
Revenue Service. “We drive a 
lot of people through a funnel, 
ask for a lot of pieces of paper, 
and then we take those pieces 
of paper and scrutinize the 
hell out of them,” he said.
But Cathie says the amount 
of paperwork completed by 
students and their parents 
each year has nowhere to go 
but up as part of a new get-
tough policy on grant money 
that he knows isn’t going to 
win his of?ce any popularity 
contests — especially among 
those who try to fudge the 
numbers.
The problem is fraud, 
and in February of last year, 
Cathie and Vice President for 
Enrollment Bill Elliot decided 
enough was enough. “We de-
cided to do administratively 
what very few schools are do-
ing,” Cathie said. “We decided 
to go very aggressively after 
fraud and abuse.” 
Eighteen months later, he 
says it’s clear that roughly 
10 percent of the applica-
tions students and their 
families submit each year 
contain intentionally bogus  
information.
The impetus for the new 
crackdown, according to 
Cathie, is a disparity between 
available aid and student 
need, which has been increas-
ing for some time. Paternal 
income, he says, has not 
kept pace with tuition and  
room/board increases in re-
cent years. “What you have is 
costs going up about $1,500, 
mom and dad’s ability to pay 
going up about $400, so you 
have a raw ?nancial need of 
about 1,100 bucks,” he says. 
“We don’t have 1,100 more 
free dollars to cover it. That’s 
the problem. This has been 
happening for a long time, 
gradually.” 
Cathie says that Carn-
egie Mellon has increased the 
amount of ?nancial aid given 
out, despite cuts in federal 
funds. “The government has 
an abysmal track record for 
higher education,” he said. 
“We have fewer grant dollars 
now from the federal govern-
ment than we had in 1979.” 
For comparison, he points to 
the fact that in 1979, the Uni-
versity gave out $1,586,000 in 
student aid, or 10 percent of 
tuition income; last year, the 
?gure was $11 million, which 
is about a 19 percent return 
of tuition dollars, and Cathie 
says Carnegie Mellon will give 
out $12,785,000 this year, for 
a record of approximately 20 
percent of tuition income.
“Now if you divide that 
by, let’s say about 2,600 kids 
who have a need, you’re going 
to come up with about $650. 
That’s the average amount of 
free money that’s increased. 
That’s a long way from the 
over $1,000 [per student] that 
we need.... What’s happening 
is the ?nancial needs of our 
students are going up faster 
than the sources to meet the 
need.”The problem of fraud, 
then, only aggravates this 
need. One of the most com-
mon attempts at beating the 
system is through the tax 
rolls. In these instances, Cath-
ie says, “the tax return we get 
is not the same tax return that 
goes to the IRS.”
In such cases, he feels the 
problem lies in the powers-
that-be in the federal govern-
ment, where the ?nancial 
needs of students are ?rst 
assessed. “With the current 
system, a majority of [the re-
quired information] is on the 
front page of the 1040, as far 
as income,” Cathie said. “If 
you understand tax law, and 
can take advantage of it, you 
can beat the system.”
Currently, the government 
conducts random computer 
checks on about 30 percent 
of the students applying for 
aid on a national level. Cathie 
says that Carnegie Mellon will 
do the same with aid recipi-
ents here — sifting through 
the other 70 percent in the 
process.
“We’ll get everyone be-
fore they’re a senior,” he said. 
“Sometime during those four 
years Carnegie Mellon will 
pay the fee and go get the real 
tax return to see if it matches 
up. If it’s phony, there’s a real 
problem.”
Even if the forms match, 
however, Cathie says the 
numbers often don’t stand up 
to the test of basic math. “If 
you’ve got $2,500 in interest 
dividends in your tax returns, 
I go in and say, at 8 percent, 
you have about $31,250 in the 
bank,” he said. “Now if you re-
port $10,000, then I’ve got to 
know the trick how you can 
have $10,000 in the bank and 
you can get $2,500 in interest 
dividends, because I gotta use 
the same investment ?rm!”
Even in the midst of glar-
ing inconsistencies, however, 
Cathie says that discretion is 
still the better part of valor 
in what he calls a very “labor 
intensive” process that is more 
of an art than a science. “It 
can be legitimate. You may 
have taken out $21,000 to buy 
a new car, or to put a roof on 
your house, or pay legal ex-
penses. So you have a lot of 
anecdotal information.” 
A common source of red 
?ags, he says, are simply 
honest mistakes. “There are 
people who don’t intention-
ally cheat, but still don’t give 
the right answers, because 
the form is a pain to ?ll out. I 
know it is.”
Often, however, the case 
is more cut and dry. A trick 
unique to local students is 
securing aid based on the ex-
pectation of their living on 
campus, and then commuting 
to school from home.
Cathie also says that some 
39 percent of students on aid 
(about 1,000 students) list 
another family member in 
college. But by subsequent 
checking in cooperation with 
other schools, he says they 
have determined that some-
where between 12 and 19 per-
cent of these alleged siblings 
turn out not to be enrolled.
Fake parental divorces are 
yet another example of abuse 
of the system. Knowing the 
?nancial gains of listing a 
single income, parents have 
lied about their marital status, 
said Cathie, adding that all 
it took to expose these cases 
was to request a copy of the 
divorce settlement. “If they 
get divorced, then the federal 
government only counts the 
income with whom the stu-
dent is residing. Typically it’s 
Mom. So you get aid based on 
Mom’s income and Dad could 
be a millionare.”
Another way many stu-
dents show lesser means on 
their aid applications is by 
claiming independent status. 
While Cathie says such dec-
larations are sometimes valid 
(such as in the case of “non-
traditional” students) he says 
abuse is the rule, rather than 
the exception, citing examples 
of students living in expensive 
off-campus apartments with 
no visible means of support.
Because of this, Cathie says 
Carnegie Mellon is forced to 
take the hard line: “You can 
?ll out all the forms, and the 
government will accept you 
as independent, but Carnegie 
Mellon won’t for purposes of 
our money,” he said. “We’re 
not going to allow it to hap-
pen. Because the basic tenet 
is that an independent school 
has to use is, we’re going by 
Mom and Dad’s ability to pay, 
not their willingness ... we’ll 
work with you, but you’re not 
going to get additional grant 
dollars over the next student 
because your parents don’t 
want to pay, while their par-
ents are struggling.”
Cathie believes this prac-
tice is especially widespread, 
citing government ?gures that 
list 60 percent of federal aid 
recipients as ?nancially inde-
pendent. “Now you look out 
there. Do we have 60 percent 
of the students going to col-
lege who are independent? 
Gimme a break, no way ... 
something’s the matter.”
CMU cracks down on ?nancial aid fraud
Expansion of phone services in motion
MARCH 16, 1992
During spring break, 
Carnegie Mellon work crews 
will take the ?rst steps to pro-
viding students new ways to 
reach out and touch someone 
by beginning the installation 
of a new campus phone sys-
tem to be completed over the 
summer. Beginning next fall, 
Carnegie Mellon will provide 
expanded telephone service 
to all University residences as 
a result of a move away from 
Bell of Pennsylvania toward 
Carnegie Mellon ownership 
of all Carnegie Mellon phone 
lines.
When the new system is 
?nished, Carnegie Mellon 
students will be able to enjoy 
options including call wait-
ing, call forwarding, and con-
ference calling.
“SDC has wanted to get 
these options at a reason-
able cost for a while,” said 
SDC housing committee 
chair John DiCosola, “but at 
the beginning of the year we 
talked to Bell and found out it 
wasn’t possible with our cur-
rent  system.”
DiCosola explains that ev-
ery University-owned room 
is equipped with two sets of 
phone lines — one set in the 
walls and one in the ?oors. 
Those in the walls are the 
property of Bell, while the 
lines running under the ?oors 
belong to Carnegie Mellon. 
The currently unused ?oor 
lines must be activated for 
the options to take effect, giv-
ing the University ownership 
of its telephone system and 
the ability to offer “reliable 
and cost-effective services to 
the University community.”
DiCosola is quick to point 
out that the phone upgrade 
will not result in higher room 
prices for next year. 
All expenses have been 
previously factored into this 
year’s room rates, keeping 
University residents from suf-
fering more increases in their 
housing bills.
“The services itself is a 
dollar a month,” DiCosola 
said. “The biggest cost we 
had to contend with was the 
purchase of the new phones.” 
Housing will be providing 
most residences with new 
desk phones, as current 
phones are not compatible 
with the new options.
Although students will not 
see any signi?cant differenc-
es until the expanded phone 
services take effect next fall, 
hardware must be installed 
over spring break to prepare 
for this summer’s work. To 
begin the installation, crews 
must brie?y interrupt service 
on Saturday. Says DiCosola, 
“The break shouldn’t be any 
more than 10 minutes to an 
hour.”
DiCosola insists that the 
system itself will prove an 
overwhelmingly positive as-
pect of campus life. “There re-
ally are very few drawbacks. 
By using our own lines, we 
will even be able to get things 
?xed at a faster rate.”
SEPTEMBER 16, 1991
The Carnegie Mellon Ro-
botics Institute showed off its 
six-legged robot to the public 
by taking it out for a walk on 
Sunday. The Ambler, an acro-
nym for Autonomous Mobile 
Exploration Robot, is “unprec-
edented; nothing resembles it 
in the robotic kingdom,” ac-
cording to Eric Krotkov, a re-
searcher in the Field Robotics 
Institute.
The Ambler is a prototype 
Mars probe capable of travers-
ing a hazardous terrian while 
collecting and analyzing sam-
ples of a planet’s geophysical, 
meteorological, and biologi-
cal conditions. The Ambler 
also has earth-bound appli-
cations, such as construction, 
timbering, hazardous waste 
management, and emergency 
response.
The Ambler project started 
four years ago from a design 
by then graduate student 
John Bares and William “Red” 
Whittaker, director of the 
Field Robotics Center. 
Since the Ambler’s comple-
tion two years ago, the Am-
bler team has been concen-
trating on getting the robot to 
walk. “The ?rst year the Am-
bler learned how to take steps. 
Now it walks for long periods 
of time,” said Reid Simmons, 
a researcher in the School of 
Computer Science. Simmons 
went on to say that “Speed is 
not important; reliability is 
important in a machine that 
will be on Mars for two or 
three years.”
The most unique feature 
of the Ambler is the way it 
walks. “The body is propelled 
in a motion similar to cross 
country skiing,” Whittaker 
said. “A single leg reaches out 
in front of the others, places 
itself ?rmly on the ground like 
a ski pole, and then pulls the 
machine forward.” The rover 
walks by itself, directed by an 
intricate system of cameras, 
laser scanners, and on-board 
computers.
According to Krotkov, the 
Ambler has two types of per-
ception: passive and active 
perception. Passive percep-
tion is basically a television 
camera that takes an image 
which is de?ned by light. The 
active vision is a laser scan-
ner which determines the dis-
tance of objects in the way of 
the Ambler. These two types 
of perception are combined to 
make a representation of the 
landscape so the Ambler can 
plan a route around obstacles.
The Ambler project re-
?ects an ongoing ambition 
of the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration’s 
(NASA) to explore space. “It 
was mutual. NASA wants to 
explore space and [the Robot-
ics Institute] lives, eats, and 
breathes robotics. It is a very 
bold and ambitious program. 
It is the most ambitious at-
tempt to date to integrate,” 
Whittaker said.
The Ambler project has 
cost $1.5 million a year for 
the past three years. This cost 
re?ects the money for the 
robot itself and the intricate 
software and hardware which 
drives the machine.
The Ambler is not yet 
scheduled to go to Mars, 
as it is still a concept proto-
type. The robot ?rst has to go 
through space quali?cation, 
which entails years of the test-
ing of space-worthy compo-
nents, miniaturization of the  
robot, and achievement of suf-
?cient reliability and endur-
ance. 
“We are looking for a leap 
into exploration, not just a 
step,” Whittaker said.
CMU robot prepares for NASA trip to Mars
NOVEMBER 11, 1991
The Carnegie Mellon Stu-
dent Senate adopted a resolu-
tion that attacks the policy of 
discrimination within ROTC 
on the basis of sexual orien-
tation. The resolution, passed 
at last Tuesday’s meeting, ul-
timately states that if ROTC 
does not end its discrimina-
tion policy, the University is 
to rid the campus of all ROTC 
programs by the 1995–96 
academic year.
The resolution was draft-
ed by Christopher Wood, 
a junior psychology major 
and member of cmuOUT. 
Wood, along with Erik Alt-
mann, chair of the Student 
Senate Campus Affairs Com-
mittee, and Mike Tomblyn, 
chair of the Academic Af-
fairs Committee, approached 
the Student Senate with the  
resolution.
The resolution reads, 
“Whereas, Carnegie Mellon 
University’s Statement of 
Assurance states ‘Carnegie 
Mellon University does not 
discriminate in admission, 
employment, or administra-
tion of its programs on the 
basis of ... sexual orienta-
tion’; and whereas, ROTC, in-
cluding Army ROTC, NROTC, 
and AFROTC, is directed 
by Department of Defense 
policy which prohibits gays, 
lesbians, and bisexuals from 
service.”
The resolution goes on to 
state, “It is hypocritical of the 
University to allow ROTC to 
discriminate.” The Senate of-
?cially condemns Carnegie 
Mellon through the resolu-
tion and calls on the Universi-
ty to “state in all publications 
that the University allows 
ROTC to remain in direct 
violation of its Statement of  
Assurance.” 
The Senate also directs 
the University to replace all 
of the ?nancial aid that a stu-
dent loses by being dismissed 
from ROTC due to his or her 
sexual orientation.
The Senate has resolved 
that they “[will] prohibit 
ROTC or ROTC-sponsored 
organizations [from partici-
pating] in events funded or 
partially funded by the Stu-
dent Activities Fee.” This in-
cludes events such as Spring 
Carnival.
The Senate then directed 
the University to take mea-
sures against ROTC. The 
Senate called on Carnegie 
Mellon to “prohibit the use of 
University facilities, ?nances, 
and resources by ROTC and 
ROTC-related organizations. 
Do not agree to any new or 
extend prior contracts with 
programs of the Department 
of Defense or its branches or 
any other organization which 
requires Carnegie Mellon to 
discriminate on the basis of 
sexual orientation.”
Most importantly, the Stu-
dent Senate resolution states, 
“Be it ?nally resolved that if 
discrimination on the basis of 
sexual orientation by ROTC 
is not ended, the University is 
directed to terminate any and 
all contracts with ROTC pro-
grams by the end of 1995–96 
academic year, until those 
programs no longer discrimi-
nate on the basis of sexual 
orientation.”
According to Altmann, 
the 1996 deadline gives time 
for all the ROTC students on 
campus now to graduate. “It’s 
the University’s responsibil-
ity to ?nd alternate programs 
that don’t discriminate,” Alt-
mann said.
Wood served in the mili-
tary for two years and does 
not see the resolution as anti-
ROTC, but rather as anti-dis-
crimination. 
“There is no other option 
than to threaten to remove 
ROTC if they do not change,” 
Wood said. However, he feels 
that the University is not go-
ing to take a sudden and di-
rect action against ROTC. “I 
think ultimately the faculty 
and board of trustees will 
have to put pressure on the 
administration to change,” 
he said.
The resolution passed the 
Academic Affairs committee 
and the Executive Board of 
the Student Senate by unani-
mous vote, and it passed the 
Campus Affairs committee 
unanimously with one ab-
stention. 
When brought in front of 
the Senate as a whole, the 
resolution passed with a vote 
of 16-3-3.

2001–2002
JANUARY 21, 2002
January marked the 
groundbreaking of a ?ve-
story residence hall between 
Morewood Gardens and 
Mudge Hall. The dormitory, 
which will be built by Rycon 
Construction Company, will 
cost an estimated $12.5 mil-
lion and house 259 ?rst-year 
students. In order to blend 
with the neighboring resi-
dence halls, the exterior will 
be constructed with a mix of 
red brick and concrete.
The dormitory should be 
completed in March of 2003.
The structure will be built 
with green design principles. 
University architect Paul Tell-
ers said, “It will be an energy- 
and water-ef?cient building 
that conserves materials and 
resources, minimizes harm-
ful effects to the environ-
ment, and maximizes living  
conditions.”
The new dorm will be the 
third residence hall construct-
ed by the East Campus Project 
since 1990.
The East Campus Project, 
which grew from an archi-
tectural design submitted by 
Michael Dennis, Jeffrey Clark 
and Associates in 1987, gave 
the campus many of its dis-
tinctive architectural features, 
including Gesling Stadium 
and the University Center.
However, the new con-
struction has also caused 
some inconveniences. Molly 
McAshan, a sophomore psy-
chology major, voiced con-
cerns about careless construc-
tion workers. “I’m always 
walking by here,” she said, “I 
almost got spit on yesterday.”
In some cases, Housing 
Services has attempted to 
mitigate students’ concerns. 
Noisy activities are not al-
lowed to begin until 8 a.m. 
so students living nearby will 
not be awakened by the din 
of concrete-mixing machines. 
While there seem to be little 
problems with noise levels 
currently, one concern was 
expressed by Kevin Rohm-
ann, a sophomore in biol-
ogy and psychology, “[Noise] 
may be more of a problem in 
the spring when people have 
their windows open.” Direc-
tor of Housing Services Tim 
Michael sent an email to all 
Mudge and Morewood resi-
dents to inform them a com-
mittee of staff and residents 
will be formed as a means of 
update on construction prog-
ress and for addressing issues 
and concerns.
CMU begins construction of 
Stever House residence hall
SEPTEMBER 17, 2001
In a poignant event marked 
by quiet simplicity, ?ve hun-
dred students gathered at 
the Fence on Tuesday night 
to hold a candlelight vigil for 
the injured and dead from the 
morning’s tragedy. Points of 
soft candlelight lit the lawn, 
as students took to the Fence, 
expressing their grief, con-
dolences, and hopes through 
words, songs, and tears. The 
moving lyricism of “Amazing 
Grace” stilled the crowd into 
silence while the combined 
voices of the student body in 
“My Country, ’Tis of Thee” res-
onated with painful aptness 
into the night sky.
Many students shared their 
initial disbelief at the surreal 
news, and their ensuing panic 
as they desperately tried to 
contact family and friends 
in New York, while others 
thanked the student body 
for showing its support. One 
speaker recalled how she was 
touched by a random act of 
kindness when she was given 
a hug and word of encourage-
ment by a complete stranger 
as she went to class crying. 
Others spoke of how they 
knew “everything was going 
to be all right, as there is an-
other home, here at Carnegie 
Mellon.”
“Being a New Yorker, an 
American, and a human be-
ing, I was shocked like ev-
eryone else and at a loss for 
words. Being so far away from 
home, I fear driving back to 
my city and not being able to 
recognize it anymore,” said 
Andress Appolon, a senior 
drama major in BHA. “As for 
post-shock, I have the same 
question that’s on everyone’s 
mind — ‘What’s next?’ I pray 
for the families that have lost 
loved ones and for the people 
I’ve lost.”
The candlelight vigil, in 
spite of the inherently tragic 
tone, was characterized by 
an exceptional degree of  
maturity. 
A large number of those 
who spoke touched on the 
importance of prayer and 
urged their peers not to per-
petuate the cycle of hate and 
violence, but to “keep those 
responsible for this terrible 
act in our prayers tonight.” A 
majority stated that the war 
against terrorism was not a 
physical one and would only 
be won with unity and cour-
age. “It is my sincere hope and 
solemn prayer that we can ?ll 
our emptiness with love and 
turn our anger and terror into 
peace,” said Student Body 
Vice President Brian Namey.
Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy closed the 
candlelight vigil with these 
words; “In my twenty years 
here at Carnegie Mellon, I 
have never seen something 
so amazing, with the students 
and community coming to-
gether in a way like never  
before.”
The fraternity Phi Kap-
pa Theta, despite having  
guarded the Fence for the past 
weeks, invited everyone to 
paint the Fence with words of 
condolence and hope for all 
involved in the incident. Stu-
dents strode forward to paint 
the Fence, traditionally a sym-
bol of youth and exuberance 
on CMU’s campus, in somber 
silence, with calls to “Unity” 
and “Peace.”
On Wednesday afternoon, 
a forum was held in the Ran-
gos Room of the University 
Center, with the intention 
of letting students and staff 
voice any thoughts they had 
on Tuesday’s tragedy. It was 
an intimate gathering, and 
many speakers suggested 
courses of action, from set-
ting up a dialogue panel to 
raising funds for the Ameri-
can Red Cross. A few others 
expressed their grief and their 
sudden sense of vulnerability 
as their country that was once 
thought infallible was thor-
oughly violated.
On a different note, Pro-
vost Mark Hamlet lauded the 
activist spirit demonstrated by 
the school community and re-
counted how Carnegie Mellon 
had provided logistical sup-
port to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and offered to 
support the State Emergency 
Services. Determinedly, Ham-
let said that “it is the refusal 
to back down, to have classes 
today, to carry on, that will ul-
timately beat terrorism.”
Most students, staff, and 
faculty have responded to 
the situation with fear and 
sadness, but also a quick and 
powerful call for peace and  
togetherness. 
“My overwhelming senti-
ment is sorrow. Sorrow for 
the lives lost, for the injured, 
and for the family and friends 
of those most directly im-
pacted. One can’t help but be 
uplifted, though, by the cour-
age and compassion of people 
throughout the world in re-
sponse to the tragedy. It is de-
monstrative of not just what 
America stands for, but what 
all free societies stand for,” 
Murphy said.
Besides uniting in Ameri-
can pride, CMU has also come 
together in campus pride. “We 
have all lamented at one point 
or another how distinct our 
various ambitions make the 
discourse of our day-to-day 
lives, but no one could ever 
now question the underlying 
bond of the members of our 
University family,” Murphy 
said. “At our time of great-
est need, our essential care 
for one another, and for oth-
ers beyond the campus, have 
been unfailing. It will contin-
ue to be, I know.”
Aseem Garg, a senior in 
social and decision sciences 
and the president of Amnesty 
International, hopes that the 
campus will maintain a mood 
of peace and community and 
will not lash out at those who 
are not truly responsible for 
the events. “During this hor-
ri?c time it is important to 
refrain from scapegoating on 
the basis of race or religion 
and to ensure that the rights 
and freedoms that Americans 
hold dear are not trampled 
in our hunger for vengeance. 
Justice, not vengeance, should 
be the goal,” he said.
Dewitt Latimer, a master’s 
student in civil engineer-
ing and an Alpha Phi Omega 
member, left a meaningful 
message for the campus in his 
statement, “acts of kindness 
on campus are a slap in the 
face for the people that com-
mitted the attacks.”
A campus mourns September 11th
FEBRUARY 4, 2002
After receiving online 
feedback from over 700 stu-
dents concerning a $40,000 
surplus, the Student Dor-
mitory Council (SDC) has 
devised plans for the extra 
money.
“By spending [the money] 
through ideas generated by 
residents, we hope to have a 
long-term positive effect on 
campus,” said Anthony Bal-
ducci, SDC president.
During the fall of 2001, 
proposals were discussed by 
the SDC surplus committee.
“[Those] that were con-
sidered feasible and ben-
e?cial to the residents were 
approved and added to the 
online voting options,” said 
SDC Vice President Ken  
Herman.
The plans included in-
stalling charcoal grills out-
side residence halls, white-
boards in various dormitory 
lounges, a clock or series of 
clocks around Kirr Commons 
re?ecting campus diversity, 
and indoor bike racks.
If any money remains after 
these projects are completed, 
it may be used to redesign 
the courtyard between More-
wood Gardens and the fra-
ternity quad or to purchase a 
Dance Dance Revolution ma-
chine. “I expect to see results 
starting before midsemester 
break and continuing prob-
ably for the rest of the semes-
ter,” Balducci said.
The SDC discovered the 
surplus in its budget when it 
switched over to the Oracle 
accounting system. Money 
that had been allocated to 
some projects during previ-
ous years was never fully 
spent.
All CMU students pay a 
student activities fee that 
goes straight to the Student 
Senate and then to all the 
different clubs. SDC, on the 
other hand, is funded by a 
$12-per-semester student 
dormitory fee. The SDC con-
sidered directly refunding 
the surplus money to stu-
dents, but determined that 
this was not feasible.
“Since the bulk of the sur-
plus did not originate last 
year or the year before, it 
would not have been a return 
of the money we had given 
the surplus to this year’s resi-
dents,” Balducci said.
The improvements will 
impact a wide range of cam-
pus facilities including both 
dormitories and the Univer-
sity Center. Since Kirr Com-
mons is a popular haunt for 
transients, student voters 
favored installing clocks 
around the circular lounge.
“A series of clocks — each 
depicting a major interna-
tional time zone — could re-
?ect student diversity,” said 
Sameer Rathod, sophomore 
information systems major 
and SDC member.
SDC will install charcoal 
grills near residence halls 
like Scobell, Henderson, 
Morewood Gardens, Doherty 
Apartments, and Boss and 
McGill. The charcoal box 
grills currently at Donner and 
Mudge House are often re-
served for campus events.
These new grills would al-
low small groups of students 
to cook outdoors at their lei-
sure. 
In addition, Resident Ad-
visors could host gatherings 
for their respective ?oors 
without having to borrow 
pan charcoal grills or request 
a larger facility.
Perhaps the most peculiar 
project voted for by students, 
a Dance Dance Revolution 
machine, is a game in which 
players must mimic the di-
rection of arrows on a screen 
with their feet by moving 
between four pressured foot 
pads.
Some students feel SDC 
should spend the surplus on 
more practical and immedi-
ate dormitory renovations 
rather than investing in recre-
ational ideas such as a Dance 
Dance Revolution machine.
“Surplus should be spent 
on CPS (Central Property 
Services, the organization in 
charge of janitorial services 
at Carnegie Mellon),” said 
junior music major Joellen 
Miller.
Students and SDC allocate $40,000 for campus renovations
AUGUST 27, 2001
This fall, Carnegie Mel-
lon will become the largest 
purchaser of wind-generated 
electricity in the country, a 
purchase that has earned the 
University a Green Power 
Leadership Award from the 
Environmental Protection 
Agency.
The one-year contract 
will provide ?ve percent of 
the University’s total energy 
and cost $81,000 more than 
electricity from fossil fuels 
or other traditional sources. 
CMU’s agreement was made 
with Community Energy, Inc., 
a distributor of renewable 
energy, and Environmental 
Defense, a nonpro?t organi-
zation that studies environ-
mental issues.
“Developing new technol-
ogies, policies, and practices 
to protect and enhance our 
global environment is one of 
our strategic priorities,” said 
University President Jared 
Cohon. Cohon, who has a 
background in environmental 
studies and civil engineering, 
added that the University is 
committed to improving envi-
ronmental quality and provid-
ing a model for other universi-
ties and organizations.
The wind-generated elec-
tricity will come from 1.5 
megawatt wind turbines at 
the Exelon-Community En-
ergy Wind Farm at Mill Run 
in Fayette County, 40 miles 
southeast of Pittsburgh. The 
farm is the largest wind farm 
in the eastern U.S. CMU will 
purchase 4,778 megawatt-
hours from the turbines.
A “University Challenge” 
is being conceived to increase 
environmental awareness and 
practices on campus and to 
encourage students, faculty, 
and staff to conserve. The 
goal is to help offset the 48 
percent premium CMU is pay-
ing for the wind power.
The challenge will de-
crease operation costs by en-
couraging recycling habits 
and using different lighting 
implementations in campus 
buildings. Innovative ideas 
for bene?cial environmental 
practices will be rewarded 
with gift certi?cates. A web-
site will track ideas, sugges-
tions, and awards.
Rising energy costs and 
environmental concerns as-
sociated with coal-generated 
electricity have caused an in-
creased interest in alternative 
forms of energy. Wind energy 
is one of the fastest grow-
ing energy alternatives, and 
it provides several environ-
mental advantages over the 
use of fossil fuels. However, 
wind-generated power poses 
several problems that prevent 
it from being able to replace 
traditional sources on a large 
scale. Windmills, for instance, 
are expensive and require a 
lot of maintenance.
“There has been a massive 
backlash that the wind gen-
erators are unsightly,” said 
Cliff Davidson, director of the 
CMU Environmental Institute 
and member of the environ-
mental practices committee 
that made the decision to pur-
chase wind power. Davidson 
added that people have com-
plained about the generators 
being noisy and dangerous.
Despite costs to the Uni-
versity and safety and aes-
thetic concerns about wind 
turbines, the wind power 
purchase is one step in line to 
a much larger goal for CMU. 
“The University can move so-
ciety towards a sustainable 
state,” Davidson said.

OCTOBER 25, 2010
This year, Hunt Library 
will celebrate its 50th year on 
campus — and students can 
expect not only a birthday 
celebration with cupcakes, 
but also a substantial change 
to the exterior of the build-
ing. In recognition of the li-
brary’s 50 years of service to 
students and the community, 
the Hunt Foundation will be 
funding the installation of 
permanent exterior lighting 
similar to that of the Randy 
Pausch Memorial Bridge.
The additional lighting 
was proposed by the Hunt 
Foundation’s Bill Hunt. “Bill 
Hunt, who is a grandson of 
those who gave us Hunt Li-
brary, was on campus one 
night, and he noticed that the 
library was not completely lit 
because there are places that 
are not being used during the 
evening hours. He thought it 
would look better if it were 
totally lit, so he sent an email 
to President Cohon making 
that suggestion,” said Glori-
ana St. Clair, the dean of Uni-
versity Libraries.
After receiving the email, 
Cohon enlisted the help of 
Cindy Limauro, a profes-
sor of lighting in the schools 
of Architecture and Drama. 
Limauro’s previous work is 
featured in a number of Pitts-
burgh’s historical sites, from 
St. Bede’s Church and the 
miniature railroad exhibit at 
the Carnegie Science Center 
to Carnegie Mellon’s Pausch 
Memorial Bridge.
“President Cohon re-
quested that Cindy do an 
assessment and help decide 
whether the bene?t of having 
it look nice would outweigh 
the costs of having it lit all 
the time. Cindy was teach-
ing a lighting class at that 
time and had those students 
do an assessment of the idea 
as well. These students came 
up with the idea of, rather 
than keeping the pre-existing 
lights inside the library on at 
all times, they would rather 
like to light the building on 
the outside in the same way 
that the Pausch Bridge is lit,” 
St. Clair said.
“The light will be jazzy 
and fun, like the lighting on 
the current bridge,” added  
St. Clair. “We’re all excited.”
Students also seem to be 
excited about the lighting. “It 
is a great idea,” said sopho-
more electrical and computer 
engineering major Jecolia 
Longtchi. “We all spend so 
much time in the library, it 
might as well be pretty.”
The new lighting will be 
unveiled during a formal 
event thanking the Hunt 
Foundation for its gift. This 
formal lighting will be the 
?nal celebration of three cur-
rently planned to take place 
in the upcoming month. 
“We’re having a party for 
students, a party for the staff 
who currently work in the 
library, and then the third 
formal event with the Hunt 
family, the president, and the 
trustees,” St. Clair said.
The ?rst event called 
“Happy 50th, Hunt Library!” 
is aimed at including 
students in the celebration. 
This upcoming party was 
organized largely by the 
University Libraries’ Student 
Advisory Committee. 
Committee member Aaron 
Gross highly encouraged 
students to attend the 
birthday celebration, as 
the birthday party “is an 
opportunity for students to 
create a small thank-you gift 
for the Hunt Foundation, and 
there will also be cupcakes  
to eat.”
“I think the biggest reason 
for students to be involved in 
the birthday party, as well as 
in thanking the Hunts, is the 
high use of the library. The li-
brary’s annual gate count has 
almost reached 1.5 million. 
The library is an academic 
destination, but it also serves 
as a social destination central 
to the student experience,” 
Gross said.
Hunt receives new 
exterior lighting Tepper alumnus awarded Nobel Prize
OCTOBER 25, 2010
An alumnus of Carnegie 
Mellon’s economics depart-
ment has been awarded the 
Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize 
in the Economic Sciences, 
commonly referred to as 
the Nobel Prize in Econom-
ics. Dale T. Mortensen, who 
earned his Ph.D. from the 
Graduate School of Indus-
trial Administration (now 
the Tepper School of Busi-
ness) in 1967, received the 
award with Christopher 
A. Pissarides and Peter A.  
Diamond of the London 
School of Economics and the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, respectively.
The Nobel committee 
awards the prize to econo-
mists whose work has made 
a signi?cant impact on the 
?eld across a long period of 
time. The 2010 winners were 
credited with researching 
and creating important labor 
models that took into account 
how government regulations 
and policies made an impact 
on ?elds including unem-
ployment and the wages of  
workers.
Since 1967, Mortensen has 
served as a professor at North-
western University in the Kel-
logg School of Business.
His colleague at the univer-
sity, Joel Mokyr, a professor 
in the arts and sciences, said, 
“[Mortensen] explains a great 
deal about why at any given 
point in time there are a lot of 
people who are not working, 
and he gives a very rich and 
extremely useful theory of un-
employment that’s very differ-
ent from our normal ideas of 
unemployment.”
The theory that won 
Mortensen the award chal-
lenges the ideas of classical 
economics regarding how 
people ?nd jobs and how 
companies ?ll vacancies. 
Classical economists believed 
that in a free market with-
out government regulation, 
there would be an ef?cient 
outcome in the market for hu-
man labor. This means that 
people would eventually ?nd 
a way to work in parts of the 
economy that were relevant to 
their skills and that employers 
and employees would be able 
to settle on wages that fairly  
represented how much work-
ers contributed to the success 
of the ?rm. All laborers in the 
economy would be contribut-
ing, and their skills would be 
utilized to maximize produc-
tivity.
However, Mortensen 
pointed out that this classic 
understanding of the labor 
economy does not include 
search costs. Search costs are 
the costs that people have to 
pay when attempting to ?nd 
employment. These costs can 
include the amount of money 
it takes to move to a new city 
to work, to buy a new home, to 
?y to an interview, and more.
Mortensen’s research 
states that these costs create 
a barrier between a person 
and employment that may be 
available. In an unregulated 
market, these barriers create 
higher unemployment and 
don’t allow all workers to use 
his or her skills to achieve the 
highest level of productivity 
for the economy.
This analysis supports a 
possible outside party, such 
as the government, interven-
ing to coordinate potential 
employers and employees to 
utilize one another.
Mortensen is now the ?fth 
degree holder from Carnegie 
Mellon to win the Nobel Prize 
in Economics. John Forbes 
Nash, who received his bach-
elor’s and master’s degrees 
from Carnegie Mellon in 1948, 
won the prize in 1994 for his 
extensive work in the ?eld of 
game theory. Last year, Oliver 
E. Williamson, a University of 
California, Berkeley professor 
and a Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. 
graduate, won an award for 
his work in demonstrating 
how ?rms like companies and 
corporations have close simi-
larities with governmental 
bodies.
Anjum Rangwala, a ?rst-
year economics major, said, 
“After my ?rst lecture in 
Professor [Steven] Klepper’s 
class, I knew how good the 
economics program was 
here. But after hearing 
about alumni of the program 
winning awards like the Nobel 
Prize, it makes you feel really 
proud to be a part of the 
department.”
With two Nobel Prizes won 
in the last two years, it’s easy 
to wonder who at Carnegie 
Mellon will be  awarded next.
CMU students’ video creeps into Rolling Stone coverage
FEBRUARY 21, 2011
Rarely do college students 
take center stage in national 
debates about artistic plagia-
rism, but that’s exactly what 
happened to Carnegie Mellon 
?rst-years Joe Reilly, a CFA 
student, and Sean Hoffman, 
an H&SS student. Their video 
“What is The Creep” made 
national headlines after Satur-
day Night Live (SNL) released 
a digital short, “The Creep,” 
that eerily echoed some of the 
elements of the Carnegie Mel-
lon students’ video.
“For most of the semester, 
it was just an inside joke for 
fun,” Reilly said. “And then 
we were like, ‘Yeah, we could 
make a video,’ but everyone 
had work. And near the end 
of the semester, we were like, 
‘We really should make a vid-
eo,’ and we got a lot more time 
near ?nals week, so we started 
shooting then.” The two then 
posted the video on YouTube 
in mid-January. The video, 
titled “What is the Creep?”, 
features Hoffman and Reilly 
dancing the Creep at vari-
ous locations around campus, 
creeping on unsuspecting stu-
dents, and occasionally wear-
ing a velociraptor mask, all 
to Justice’s song “Waters of 
Nazareth.”
Approximately a week af-
ter Hoffman and Reilly posted 
the video on YouTube, SNL 
released a digital short called 
“The Creep” on its show. Al-
though SNL’s video was of a 
higher production quality and 
contained an original song fea-
turing Nicki Minaj, there are 
still some uncanny similarities 
between the two videos. In it, 
the Lonely Island trio sings 
about creeping while walk-
ing about with bended knees, 
clawed hands, and creepy 
smiles, similar to the dance in 
Hoffman and Reilly’s video. A 
Tyrannosaurus rex mask also 
makes an appearance near the 
end of the video.
“Our ?rst thoughts were, 
‘This is eerily similar,’ ” Hoff-
man said after seeing SNL’s 
“The Creep.” “We can see the 
claw thing going on, the bend-
ing of the knees ... and then, 
near the end of the video, 
we saw the T-rex head, and 
that’s when we were like, ‘Oh 
my God, there’s no way that 
this is just a coincidence.’ So, 
from there, we all got on our 
YouTube accounts and started 
looking up wherever the video 
had appeared, and started 
saying, ‘Hey, this is a rip-off 
of our video.’ But then the 
next morning we woke up and 
were like, ‘Well, we kind of 
overreacted a little bit,’ and we  
started removing our com-
ments, but by that time other 
fans had seen it and started 
doing the same thing that we 
did, and our views started to 
go up.”
The duo’s fans were not 
the only ones who noticed 
the similarities between the 
videos: The magazine Roll-
ing Stone took notice as well. 
Reilly’s mother had been high 
school friends with the artis-
tic director at Rolling Stone, so 
when his mother posted the 
students’ video on Facebook, 
claiming that SNL had copied 
her son, the artistic director 
took notice. “Sean and I were 
in biology [class], and I get a 
text from my mom that says, 
‘Hey, call me soon, Rolling 
Stone is going to call you for an 
interview and I want to talk to 
you about it ?rst,’ ” Reilly re-
called. “We were both just like, 
‘What are you talking about?’ 
That was the longest last 20 
minutes of that class ever.”
“We were shocked that 
it had grown from this 
small incident — this ‘mini  
controversy,’ as they called 
it in Rolling Stone’s article,” 
Hoffman said. 
When asked whether he 
had expected any major me-
dia to notice the similarities 
between the two videos, Reilly 
said, “We kind of hoped in 
the back of our minds.... That 
night [when SNL released 
its video] we sent out some 
things, we posted a couple of 
things on the internet.... It was 
just kind of hopeful, like ‘may-
be somebody will notice.’ ”
Soon enough, SNL took 
notice of the mini controversy 
as well, releasing a statement 
to Rolling Stone saying, “We 
wrote and recorded the song 
over the summer, and [Nicki] 
Minaj recorded her part in No-
vember 2010, well before that 
video was made.... That’s cra-
zy that they have a T-rex head 
as well! I guess great minds 
really do think alike. And by 
great minds we mean ours and 
theirs. We enjoyed their danc-
ing and hope they continue 
their creeping ways.”
“I was surprised with some 
of the stuff they said, like 
‘Great minds think alike,’ and 
by minds, talking about ours 
and theirs,” Hoffman said. “I 
was shocked that they had 
even taken the time out of 
their day to even watch both 
of our videos, so it was pretty 
cool.”
When asked whether or not 
he believed SNL’s claim that it 
was all a coincidence, Hoff-
man said, “At ?rst, after the 
article, we had thought, ‘Yeah, 
it was just a coincidence,’ but 
then other people in our dorm 
would come up to us and ask 
us, ‘Well, why didn’t you ask 
when the actual video was 
?lmed?’... If they ?lmed the 
video in January after ours 
was released, you know, they 
could have rerecorded some 
of the audio or whatever [to 
incorporate the dance]. The 
song isn’t what we were de-
bating over, it was the actual 
dance.... That was one of the 
questions we wanted to ask 
them but didn’t think of until 
later.”
Whether or not SNL 
gleaned inspiration from the 
students’ video, the students 
have bene?ted from the con-
troversy: As of Sunday, their 
video had gained over 24,000 
views on YouTube, and their 
follow-up video, “How to 
Creep,” had over 11,000 
views. “We’re shocked that it 
even got that many views,” 
Hoffman admitted. “We were 
surprised [at the beginning], 
like, ‘Dude, we got 500 views! 
That’s so awesome!’ And then 
now, it’s like, ‘Hey, 20,000 
views...’ We never knew it was 
going to be that big.”
Students assemble for fence restoration
MARCH 28, 2011
A group of ?rst-year art 
students used a hacksaw on 
the Fence Monday afternoon 
to carve away some of its lay-
ers of paint. In response, Tim 
Hieter, a master’s candidate 
in materials science and en-
gineering, created a Facebook 
event — “Operation Heal the 
Fence” — that attracted hun-
dreds of students to the Cut 
that night to reclaim and re-
paint the Fence.
Hieter, after hearing about 
what happened to the Fence, 
discussed his reaction with 
friends. “We see it as the one 
real, easily identi?able sym-
bol of Carnegie Mellon, and 
everyone loves it,” he said.
The Facebook group be-
gan as a way to organize his 
friends, but after only two 
hours, nearly 300 people had 
committed to attending. By 
the end of the night, this num-
ber had climbed to almost 
1,000.
Those who arrived at mid-
night took turns painting 
the Fence black, adding the 
message “Don’t mess with 
our Fence” on the side facing 
Forbes Avenue, and writing 
personal messages of support 
on the opposite side. Nicho-
las Petrillo, a senior in me-
chanical engineering, painted 
the ?rst stroke, explaining 
through a megaphone while 
standing on the nearby picnic 
table that the Fence would be 
captured by the traditional 
rules and that no one was to 
begin painting until midnight. 
As Carnegie Mellon’s website 
and the Student Handbook 
outline, groups must capture 
and paint the Fence between 
midnight and daybreak.
Will Weiner, a sophomore 
economics and social and de-
cision sciences double major, 
and Jay Rockwell, a junior 
biomedical and chemical en-
gineering major, were some 
of the ?rst to notice when 
students began cutting into 
the Fence. Weiner, Rockwell, 
and others confronted the 
students, who were then es-
corted away by university 
personnel. Weiner described 
the Fence as “the de?nition of 
school spirit” and noted that 
“everybody felt hurt” by the 
destructive actions.
“The light will 
be jazzy and 
fun, like the 
lighting on 
the current 
bridge.”
—Gloriana St. Clair
Dean of University 
Libraries

Frame features serpentine project
In(Klein) showcases Frame Gallery Grant winners’ work
A room-sized, serpentine plastic structure is not 
what many visitors expect to find at a gallery 
exhibition, but viewers warmly greeted this artistic 
curiosity at the opening reception for the In(Klein) 
exhibition at the Frame Gallery last Friday. Created 
by fourth-year architecture majors Michael Jeffers, 
Anna Rosenblum, Liam Lowe, and Joe Colarusso, 
In(Klein) presents a perplexing and captivating 
challenge to viewers’ perceptions of the space 
around them.
The exhibition consists of a single piece that spans 
the entire room, made from dozens of triangular 
plastic cutouts, each about the length of a person’s 
forearm. Together, the plastic cutouts resemble 
large, transparent scales. The effect is, indeed, a bit 
serpentine; the structure undulates and twists upon 
itself as it stretches across the room in the shape of 
an elaborate, three-dimensional figure eight.
Rosenblum explained that the inspiration for the 
structure’s intriguing shape originally came to the 
artists when designing an elementary school with a 
winding structure wrapped around the building. The 
artists submitted their proposal and ultimately won 
the Frame Gallery Grant, which offers $300 to an 
individual or group of students that can create a site-
specific work that alters perceptions of space.
The scale is perhaps the most impressive aspect of 
the piece. Although the gallery itself is no bigger 
than about twice the size of an average dorm room, 
the structure takes up the entire space, suspended 
from the ceiling by no more than a few strings at 
various junctures. Assembling the structure was no 
easy task, according to Colarusso. He and his three 
colleagues built most of the piece on site over the 
course of one night.
Despite the scale of the piece, however, the paradox 
is that the structure does not take up much space at 
all. Visitors to the gallery ducked under the winding 
plastic and stood inside it, admiring the piece from 
various angles or casually socializing. According 
to Jeffers, this paradox is one of the driving ideas 
behind the project. “We knew we wanted something 
that was ambiguous,” he said, “something that had 
logic to it but seemed irrational.”
If ambiguity was the artists’ goal, then they certainly 
achieved it. The shape of the piece, paired with the 
grandness of its scale, made for an unconventional 
object that was open to interpretation. Third-year 
architecture major Claire He described the structure 
as “futuristic” and, despite its already impressive 
size, saw even greater potential for the piece. “It 
feels like a prototype for something bigger,” she said.
Though an unexpected use of the gallery space, 
In(Klein) does not fail to impress. Not only is 
it aesthetically captivating, but it also poses a 
challenge to the ways in which people experience 
their physical environment. In(Klein) is a compelling 
and refreshing departure from the traditional art 
exhibit and conventional perceptions of space.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
What’s the most cost-
effective way to stay 
drunk for all of Spring 
Carnival? I have no work, 
no class, no money, and 
no friends. Help me get 
drunk as cheaply as 
possible.
Sincerely,
Consuming Highly 
Economical Alcohols 
Potentially, Otherwise Will 
Imbibe Natty Only
Dear CHEAP-O WINO,
There are a few general rules 
of thumb when it comes 
to drinking cheaply. First, 
avoid beer. It will fill you up 
quickly and won’t get you 
that drunk. Second, stay out 
of bars. They have a huge 
markup. If you want to go, 
pre-game. Third, if you go to 
a party, avoid jungle juice.
So, after careful analysis, 
the most cost effective way 
to get drunk is... Franzia. 
Specifically, a box of Franzia 
red wine. At 13.6 percent 
alcohol by volume and 
coming in a five-liter box for 
less than $10, it’s the best 
deal there is. It also comes 
with several drinking games 
ready to go: Tour de Franzia, 
in which you wear a bike 
helmet and drink Franzia, 
and Slap the Bag, in which 
you take the bag of wine 
out of the box, slap it, drink 
it, and then pass it around 
(these are both more fun 
when you’re drunk). Follow 
these tips and you’ll have a 
cheap, drunk time.
Plus getting drunk on 
wine is pretty classy,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
It’s Spring Carnival again, 
and that means one thing: 
booth sex. Do you have 
any tips for doing the 
deed in a shoddy wooden 
shack?
Thanks,
Busily Organizing 
Orgasmic Times, Hidden 
Booth Activities Needed, 
Guidance Eagerly 
Requested
Dear BOOTH BANGER,
Booth sex is one of the 
oldest Spring Carnival 
traditions. However, it comes 
with its own dangers: public 
indecency arrests, collapsing 
booths, general em-bare-
ass-ment, and splinters. The 
key is to get in, do the deed 
quickly, and get out. Luckily, 
one of those shouldn’t be 
a problem. First, you need 
to scope out a good booth. 
Take the first day of Carnival 
to find a good one. It needs 
to be sturdy and have a few 
good hiding spots. Stay 
away from Kappa Alpha 
Theta’s booth — it’s always 
on the verge of collapse.
Once you’ve found a good 
booth, you need to sneak in 
at night. You may think that 
security will be a problem, 
but most of Carnival security 
is students, and students 
are easily bribed. Make sure 
there are no cops around 
and do it.
Not too hard or the whole 
booth will come down,
Patrick Hoskins

Students wandering into the College of Fine Arts (CFA)
building last week may have noticed a lot of paper rope 
hanging across the Great Hall. The installation, by artists 
Wade Kavanaugh and Stephen Nguyen, was a major 
feature of this year’s Jill Watson Festival Across the Arts.
The School of Architecture hosted the annual festival 
this past weekend. The festival, more commonly known 
as wats:ON?, featured guest speakers, demonstrations, 
workshops, and installations centered around the theme 
of “transformer.”
The festival is an annual tribute to Jill Watson — a 
Carnegie Mellon alumna, adjunct faculty member, 
and local architect — who died in a plane crash in 
1996. This marked the 15th year of the festival, which 
celebrates Watson’s “commitment to an interdisciplinary 
philosophy,” according to the festival’s website.
The wats:ON? theme this year was meant to build off 
this interdisciplinary idea and inspire questions about 
the transformation of architecture, art, and technology 
from materials to ?nished projects. All of the presenters 
demonstrated a transformative feature, whether it was 
transforming their bodies into instruments, rolled-up 
paper into sculpture, or an Arduino — an open-source 
single-board microcontroller — into a sewable patch.
“The magic of moving from pieces of material to 
something remarkable, that transition is really amazing,” 
said Pablo Garcia, assistant professor in the School of 
Architecture and co-curator of the festival with adjunct 
assistant professor Spike Wolff. “The transformation is 
really the part that we’re interested in. These people 
make the transformation visible.”
According to Garcia, the co-curators asked themselves, 
“Who can we bring in who will amaze people and 
surprise them?” while planning the festival. The result 
led them to the theme of transformer. “The transformer 
theme has a lot to do with exactly that, but people who 
do it with almost the minimum amount,” Garcia said. 
“These aren’t people who are making complex things 
out of complex things with stuff that’s over people’s 
head.”
The festival opened on Thursday with a presentation 
by Leah Buechley, an associate professor at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media 
Lab and director of the High-Low Tech research 
group. Buechley’s talk, titled “Expressive Electronics: 
Sketching, Sewing, and Sharing,” was cosponsored 
by the Human-Computer Interaction Institute’s Z-Axis 
seminar series and focused on the “diversi?cation of 
electronics,” in Buechley’s own words.
Buechley and her team of graduate students at MIT 
focus on “helping diverse people create diverse 
technology using diverse methods through diverse 
processes.” She presented an example of their work: 
a rearranged Arduino into a sewable patch, called the 
LilyPad Arduino, which has expanded the audience for 
technology by altering traditional gender patterns in 
technology and computation.
Buechley, like the rest of the presenters and participants, 
was chosen because of her focus on the transformation 
of some aspect of her work. For Buechley it was 
technology and computation. For percussionist and 
rhythm dancer Keith Terry, it was his body.
Terry performed to a full audience in the Alumni Concert 
Hall on Friday. In a performance centered on sound and 
movement, he transformed his body into a multi-faceted 
instrument. His performance on Friday was highly 
interactive; he taught audience members the basics of 
numerous types of body music and dance, including 
hambone and kecak.
“Terry’s a performer who essentially has nothing — 
just his body — and he can make an amazing array of 
sounds and beats and rhythms,” Garcia said.
Terry closed his presentation by discussing visual 
rhythms and the rhythmic qualities of architecture. After 
assigning pitches and sounds to various aspects of the 
room — including columns, wall features, and a row of 
timpanis — he joked, “We could spend the rest of the 
festival playing this room.”
The architecture of the College of Fine Arts building was 
also a recurring theme in the festival. While Terry found 
music in the architecture, Kavanaugh and Nguyen faced 
limitations created by the building while they were 
planning their installation.
Kavanaugh and Nguyen gave a casual lecture on 
Saturday night as a closing to the festival, discussing 
their previous work and their most recent project, titled 
“Tug O’ War,” which they had installed in CFA over the 
previous few days.
Their installation included nearly four miles of paper 
rope and showed how creative ideas could transform 
a challenging space into something amazing using 
common materials.
Kavanaugh and Nguyen have worked together on 
numerous collaborative projects in the past, usually 
involving paper, an economical and available material. 
They focus on movement and the viewer’s experience 
in their work. “We try to keep an element of play in 
everything we make,” Kavanaugh said.
“One of the goals for the wats:ON? festival is to be 
wondrous, to amaze, to inspire,” Garcia said. “And 
I think that’s one way that you can connect the 
?ve schools in the College of Fine Arts, which the 
festival serves. It’s hard to connect music to drama to 
architecture to art to design, but one of the things that 
they do is they are this creative endeavor that is usually 
amazing and really inspiring and wonderful.”

Wade Kavanaugh and Stephen Nguyen were originally intimidated by the venue for their installation “Tug O’ War.” 
“[The Great Hall] was beautiful and we didn’t want to screw it up,” Kavanaugh said. “We were really scared by it.”

On Dub
So, you like dubstep. Good for you. But have you heard of 
dub?
Before dubstep, there was a lot of good electronic music. 
In fact, there was even electronic before computers. You’re 
probably aware of reggae and Bob Marley’s music. But 
if you’re only aware of Bob Marley’s now-iconic music, 
you’re missing out on some of the most innovative 
electronic music.
Dub grew out of reggae in the late ’60s and was pioneered 
by artists like King Tubby, Lee “Scratch” Perry, and 
Scientist. Reggae, which focuses on offbeat rhythms, 
staccato chords, and call-and-response vocals, is often 
criticized for sounding uniform in sound design; however, 
dub sought to resolve this problem. By removing vocals 
and emphasizing the drum and bass parts of the track, 
dub music focuses on the talents of producers and their 
ability to manipulate the now-archaic gear they owned. 
Before the invention and proliferation of the computer, 
electronic backbeats were incredibly dif?cult to generate, 
let alone ?ne-tune.
Through their extensive knowledge of their equipment 
(and ability to modify it), dub producers were able to add 
extensive amounts of echo, reverb, and delay. Creating 
dub versions of reggae tracks served as an opportunity 
for producers to differentiate themselves and showcase 
their labels’ equipment. Similar to the way The Velvet 
Underground in?uenced almost every rock band that 
followed it, these dub producers heavily in?uenced the 
originators of techno, jungle, drum and bass, house, punk, 
trip hop, ambient, hip hop, and dubstep.
To begin to appreciate and love this incredibly powerful 
type of music, I recommend getting a copy of Scientist’s 
Heavyweight Dub Champion, waiting for a sunny day, and 
letting the good vibes ?ow.

Have you heard the choir sing?
Carnegie Mellon Concert Choir performs with PSO
Carnegie Mellon’s concert choir performed with 
the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) at Heinz 
Hall on Friday night. The program was titled “Do 
You Hear the People Sing?” and featured the music 
of French composer Claude-Michel Schönberg 
and musical theater lyricist Alain Boublil, who 
collaborated to produce such musical masterpieces 
as Miss Saigon and Les Misérables. The concert 
was a musical review-style show that featured the 
concert choir and six professional soloists.
Conducted by Jack Everly, the principal pops 
conductor with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, 
the PSO made music at its best. Schönberg’s 
melodies were played so beautifully and with such 
emotion, they warmed the hearts of audience 
members. Favorite songs such as “Master of the 
House,” “Bring Him Home,” and “One Day More” did 
not disappoint.
The soloist lineup for this performance was quite 
interesting and featured talented, young Broadway 
stars as well as the renowned theater veteran 
Terrence Mann. The list of performers included 
Broadway performers Eric Kunze, Jennifer Paz, 
Kathy Voytko, Marie Zamora, and Ben Crawford.
Unfortunately, Mann incurred vocal injuries after the 
?rst performance on Thursday night and was unable 
to perform all of his scheduled numbers on Friday. 
While he did visit the stage to give a charismatic 
performance of “Master of the House” and say a few 
words, it was disappointing that he could not sing 
the famous Les Mis ballad, “Stars.”
In the absence of Mann, however, Crawford did 
not disappoint. The young singer was recruited 
to ?ll in for Mann for the remainder of the show’s 
run, which continued through Sunday. Crawford’s 
rendition of “Stars” was stunning. He sang with 
grand emotion and beautiful phrasing, and his voice 
rang throughout the theater. He had a clear, strong 
baritone sound that earned him a rousing ovation 
from the packed house.
The other soloists were not very engaging. Voytko 
did give an impressive performance of the new 
song “Maybe,” which will be premiered in the 2013 
revival of Miss Saigon. However, Zamora and Paz 
were less impressive. They seemed to lack the vocal 
strength required to ?ll a space with the grand 
music of Schönberg and Boublil. Unfortunately, Paz 
and Voytko’s joint rendition of “I Dreamed a Dream” 
at the end of Act 1 was disappointing. Their pop 
version was in?uenced by the television show Glee, 
which may have engaged the audience if done well, 
but the singing was imprecise.
Overall, the program’s soloists were successfully 
aided by the Carnegie Mellon Concert Choir. 
Directed by Carnegie Mellon’s director of choral 
studies Robert Page, the choir did not disappoint: 
The musicality they presented was evident 
throughout the performance. It was obvious that 
each member was extremely dedicated to and 
engaged with the music. The shining moments for 
the choir were in the songs “One Day More” and “Do 
You Hear the People Sing.” The chorus was also very 
engaging during “Master of the House.”
In all, the PSO’s “Do You Hear the People Sing?” 
was an entertaining night of music. The musicians 
played with remarkable beauty and presented this 
beloved music at its best.

For many students, the Spring Carnival concert, hosted 
by AB Concerts, is one of the most exciting parts of 
Carnival. The combination of the growing expectation 
of a large concert by a well-known band and the strong 
sense of tradition associated with Carnival results in 
an inimitable cohesion within the Carnegie Mellon 
community. This year, Passion Pit has been chosen to 
headline the concert, with local indie pop band Donora 
and WRCT DJ Gusto as opening acts.
Passion Pit began as the solo project of audio engineer, 
vocalist, and keyboardist Michael Angelakos. His 
debut EP, Chunk of Change, was originally a gift he had 
given to his girlfriend that became popular among the 
student body at Emerson College, where Angelakos 
was studying at the time. The indie community 
embraced Passion Pit: a heartwarming conception, a 
bedroom production, some catchy hooks, and a singer 
with an endearing (or distracting, depending on your 
perspective) falsetto. Chunk of Change is pretty much a 
checklist for indie hype.
What made Chunk of Change truly noteworthy was its 
sometimes embarrassingly sincere lyrics. In a culture 
that fully embraces sarcasm and irony, it is rare to ?nd 
any musician that rejects these values as thoroughly as 
Angelakos and his band. On 2008’s full-length Manners, 
the now fully formed Passion Pit reigned in the emotional 
bombast of the lyrics and produced a collection of nine 
songs more dynamic than any on Chunk of Change.
It is the unabashed excitement and complete apathy 
toward trendiness that makes Manners an enjoyable 
listen even four years after its release. An even stronger 
testament to Passion Pit’s music is the freshness of the 
band’s live performance. Since the group began touring 
in support of Manners, it has only had a catalogue of 
15 or so songs to draw upon for their shows. Yet its 
performances are not simply a musical experience: They 
are also a kinesthetic one. A Passion Pit concert requires 
constant motion. Whether it’s jumping, dancing, or 
moshing, Passion Pit makes its fans want to move.
Passion Pit will be releasing its yet-to-be-named second 
album later this year. If the group’s concerts in the past 
months are any indication, Carnegie Mellon students 
can expect to hear members perform some new material 
during the upcoming performance.
The selection of Passion Pit for this year’s concert echoes 
the reality that Carnegie Mellon is not simply a center 
of innovation for computer science and technology, 
but also a hub of artistic culture. This idea that there is 
more to Carnegie Mellon than robots and bagpipes has 
been noticeable on campus this past year, especially 
when talking about the musical talents that have been 
performing on campus.
In addition to the numerous coffeehouses, musicals, 
orchestral performances, and singer-songwriter 
performances, Guster and Tokyo Police Club — both 
bands that have unique fan bases not dissimilar from the 
distinctive amalgam of Carnegie Mellon’s community — 
gave energetic and engaging performances this past fall.
This growing artistic culture on campus is perhaps one 
of the reasons that collegemagazine.com listed Carnegie 
Mellon as the ninth most hipster campus in the United 
States last December. After years of being written off 
as a geek school, the abundance of unique culture that 
exists at Carnegie Mellon and in the Pittsburgh area is 
?nally being noticed by outsiders.
Our community is driven by passion. Similar to Passion 
Pit, Carnegie Mellon students largely ignore what is 
trendy or hip in favor of pursuing their own ideas of 
self-ful?llment and enjoyment. Saturday will mark the 
intersection of two sides of the same coin: a beloved 
indie band and a prominent technical college. And it’s 
sure to be a concert to remember.
Matt Mastricova | Staffwriter
Passion Pit will perform on Saturday at 8 p.m. on the Cut. 
In the case of rain, the concert will be held in Wiegand 
Gymnasium.

Amid the jovial chaos of Spring Carnival, the Carnegie 
Mellon Filmmaking Club is offering an opportunity to 
take a three-hour breather and gain some insight into 
the world of student ?lmmaking. The Loop: Carnival Film 
Festival 2012 will take place in McConomy Auditorium 
on Friday at 2 p.m. and will feature a selection of short 
student ?lms.
The festival primarily serves to showcase and promote 
student ?lms, although it’s also a tribute to the art 
of ?lmmaking. The festival’s title pays homage to 
the zoetrope, a device dating back to ancient China 
that creates the illusion of animation with a circular 
projection “loop” of moving images.
Beyond the historical context, the title also has a 
symbolic meaning: Like the rotating images of a 
zoetrope, the ?lm festival cycles through different 
periods in the history of ?lmmaking, incorporating both 
the old and new. As the title suggests, this festival will 
take a back-to-the-basics approach, showcasing silent 
?lms and other tributes to movie-making techniques.
The Filmmaking Club, a student organization on campus 
that creates and educates about student ?lms, has 
devoted many hours in preparation for organizing and 
hosting the event. Members of the club, who hail from 
a wide range of ?elds of study, learn key skills and work 
together on collaborative projects, several of which end 
up in the festival.
“We all come together and use our skills to make a 
really, really cool project,” said club president Benjamin 
Welmond, a senior art major with a focus in ?lm.
Besides showcasing student work, the festival also 
strives to raise awareness for a little-explored activity on 
campus. Though the Filmmaking Club plays a central 
role in the festival, organizers of the event seek to 
expand interest in ?lmmaking to all students.
“It is our hope to reach out to more members of the 
CMU community,” said Hannah Polack, a sophomore 
professional and creative writing double major and 
public relations manager for the festival.
By attending the festival, viewers will also gain an 
appreciation for the extent of the work that goes into 
?lmmaking. For the students who produce these ?lms, 
making movies is often harder than it seems. “There’s so 
much more than just a camera and a script,” Welmond 
said.
According to Welmond, the ?lmmaking process is 
tedious and dif?cult, and many students encounter 
failure before creating a successful ?lm. The results can 
be highly rewarding, however. “It’s hard, but eventually 
you’ll make it if you keep trying,” he said.
The students whose work will be on display this Friday 
will surely experience this sense of grati?cation from 
seeing their ?lms on the big screen and from introducing 
other Carnegie Mellon students to the nature of their 
work in ?lmmaking.

When Elvis Costello wrote “Little Triggers” in 1978, little 
could he have known that 27 years later it would lend 
its name to the band keeping quality new-wave and 
indie rock alive in Pittsburgh. On the verge of of?cially 
releasing its second studio album and with more than 
240 shows under its belt, Triggers will be performing at 
three different locations on Carnegie Mellon’s campus in 
the next two weeks, including the Midway stage during 
Spring Carnival.
According to Triggers guitarist and co-lead vocalist 
Adam Rousseau, who graduated from Carnegie Mellon 
in 2003 with a degree in art, the group was founded 
in 2005 when four “twenty-something” musicians, all 
recently ?red from different bands, “coalesced and 
formed something new, as the rejects of other groups.” 
Along with drummer Rich “Woody” Kawood — a 2005 
Carnegie Mellon graduate — bassist Joe Kasler, and 
keyboardist/vocalist Brett Zoric, Rousseau now brings 
upbeat and refreshingly original music to stages all 
around the Northeast.
Triggers identi?es as a rock and roll group, but strives 
to transcend any one genre. “We’ve been compared to 
Elvis Costello or Spoon ... but we try to keep the songs as 
diverse as possible,” Rousseau said. 
The majority of the songwriting is done by Zoric and 
Rousseau. “We’ll bring in either a fully formed song or 
most of an idea, and then it sort of gets ?eshed out from 
there,” Rousseau said. “Everybody contributes to the 
arrangement process ... and many times something we’ll 
come in with will end up sort of totally transformed and 
completely different by the end.”
Complete with distorted guitar leads and catchy, 
de?ant vocal hooks, Triggers does not disappoint as a 
straightforward rock out?t. It does, however, offer a bit 
more ?avor than your average rock group. The group 
emulates from track to track the Clash-inspired punk 
rock of the early ’90s, mid-tempo rockabilly shuf?es 
reminiscent of Johnny Cash, and driving alternative 
rock in the vein of Franz Ferdinand, all composed and 
arranged with a smart, distinct, indie pop sensibility.
“There’s been some intra-band turmoil over the 
years,” Rousseau said, explaining the group’s internal 
dynamic. “I don’t think there’s been a time when at least 
somebody didn’t want to quit, if they didn’t actually 
quit. [But] somehow we’ve managed to stay together 
for seven years, so there must be some kind of glue 
keeping us together.” Commenting on those experiences 
deemed typical of most rock musicians, if not musicians 
in general, he added that Triggers has “played some 
interesting shows ... where stuff’s got broken, people’s 
teeth have gotten broken. If you play enough shows, 
some [stuff’s] gonna go down.”
With that said, Triggers has established itself as 
an excellent group to hear live. All four members 
sing in various capacities, and several are multi-
instrumentalists, adding unique style and texture to 
each song with everything from hand-percussion to 
synthesizers. While Triggers “[hopes] for a decent break 
to keep [them] going” according to Kawood, at their 
most fundamental, they are a group of guys who love to 
write and perform music and, despite tribulations, love 
being in a band together.
Matt Powell-Palm | Junior Staffwriter
Triggers’ of?cial CD release show for its newest album, 
Forcing a Smile, will be held at 9:30 p.m. on Friday at 
brillobox. The band will be performing live on WRCT 
88.3 FM’s “Advanced Calculus” at 7 p.m. on Monday, 
at the Midway Tent at 5 p.m. on Thursday, and at The 
Underground at 8:30 p.m. on April 26.

Jim Rugg is a Pittsburgh comics powerhouse. His 
contributions to the vitality of the comic scene have 
included mini-comics, self-publishing, and creator-
owned work with independent publishers. It’s no 
wonder the ToonSeum is honoring the contemporary 
cartoonist and working artist through the month of 
May with its exhibit, This #*?! Isn’t Very Funny.
This #*?! Isn’t Very Funny features Rugg’s well-
known work on Street Angel and Afrodisiac as well 
as new and seldom-seen pieces. This is Rugg’s ?rst 
solo exhibition and a ?rst for the ToonSeum, as the 
exhibition re?ects the more adult sensibilities of 
the comic world. Most of the pieces exhibited are 
recent, shorter pieces originally made for anthologies 
and newspapers, dating from after the completion of 
Afrodisiac. Much of the pieces are directly inspired 
by original production art of the 20th century, the 
often-discarded line art that was produced for the 
sake of reproduction.
While it’s safe to say that the idea of comics in ?ne 
art galleries has found its place in contemporary art 
criticism, it is still unclear how a viewer is intended 
to engage with comics in a gallery environment: 
whether one is supposed to pay respect from a 
distance or inspect the minutiae in search of the 
human touch. While both are valid approaches, 
they go against the cognitive escape afforded by 
the traditional private experience associated with 
comics.
As such, contemporary artists are asked to present 
their work either as ?ne art or as comics. It seems 
that they must determine whether the focus will 
be on the art or the narrative. When facing this 
dilemma, artists feel they must choose. In This #*?! 
Isn’t Very Funny, Rugg bravely provides solutions to 
this forced dichotomy.
Rugg approaches the puzzle of exhibiting comics 
in a museum by creating art speci?cally for the 
gallery environment. By drawing single large panels, 
the comics ?t within the traditional framework of 
a painting, and by allowing his panels to feature 
characters drawn at different sizes, he can create an 
unparalleled sense of depth. As a viewer gets closer, 
smaller details make themselves apparent.
A noticeable example of this practice is Rugg’s use 
of word balloons of different sizes within individual 
panels. The word bubbles’ varying sizes invite the 
viewers to get closer, if they want to read the text. In 
this way, Rugg consciously designs his work so the 
audience engages with it in the gallery space and 
so the work can con?dently straddle the seeming 
divide between comics and ?ne art.
It’s important to note that while it’s safe to label 
Rugg as a pop artist, his work does not exhibit the 
intrinsic post-modern detachedness of Andy Warhol 
and Roy Lichtenstein’s mid-20th century work. His 
work has real heart. As he describes on his website, 
Rugg seeks to “reconcile pop culture’s adventurous 
promise with the realities of the world around [him]” 
and he “[uses] the style and visual vocabulary 
of cartoons to question and lampoon consumer 
culture.”
Rather than communicating solely through abstract 
notions of color, line, and form, Rugg expresses 
his visions and communicates in the language of 
our collective, mass media-constructed childhood 
memories. That image language is his pop. Rugg 
uses comic tropes in unexpected ways: narratives 
advanced through fragments, covers for nonexistent 
stories, or sketched splash pages.
“I live in a complex world of race and gender 
roles, politics and religion, suburban isolation and 
the confusion of middle age,” reads Rugg’s artist 
statement on his website. “In my artwork, I bring 
these realities to bear on the once-safe world of 
escapist entertainment and attempt to understand 
the values of the world around me through India ink, 
steel pen nibs, sable-hair brushes, and pixels.”
