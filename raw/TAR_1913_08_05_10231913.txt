[HE LADIES OE THE 
FACULTY DISCUSS 
STUDENT WELFARE
íean Breed Appminted Chairman mf 
Cmmmitteel(HVA. LOSES 28-0 ai mass meeting
At a meeting of the Administrative 
Council of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, to which Mrs. Leete, 
Mrs. Connelley and Mrs. Hamer- 
schlag had been invited, the ladies 
present were appointed a committee, 
with Dean Breed as chairman, to con­
sider ways and means which would 
enable the ladies associated with the 
several schools to become more in­
terested in the social life of the In­
stitute.
At the suggestion of this commit­
tee, the Director called a mass meet­
ing of the “women of the Institute, 
including the wives of the men on 
the staff, and the women who are 
themselves on the staff.” There was 
a large representative gathering at 
this meeting, which was held on Oc­
tober 4th. The Director, in his ad­
dress, explained that the purpose of 
the meeting was four-fold:
First. To consider the social wel­
fare of the student who may be a 
stranger in the city;
Second. To form a committee of 
.visitors to sick students;
Third. To form some plans to fur­
ther the acquaintance and good fel­
lowship of the members of several 
faculties;
Fourth. To take a greater interest 
in. and assist and direct, so far as it 
may be advisable, the social activities 
of the students, thereby developing 
the school spirit of the Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology.
After the address of the Director, 
the ladies discussed the many phases 
of the problem, and agreed to serve 
on the various committees which 
would be necessary to do the work in­
volved.
For the purpose of continuing the 
“co-operation of the ladies of the 
Faculty” a Ways and Means Commit­
tee was organized. A Student Health 
Committee was also organized, with 
Mrs. Hamerschlag as chairman. Pro­
fessor Esquerre, in charge of the De­
partment of Student Health, will re­
port to this committee all cases of 
serious or prolonged illness of stu­
dents who are not living at home, or 
with relatives. Where it seems ad­
visable one of the ladies will diake 
a friendly visit.
The team that played and lost to 
Geneva by a score of 28 to 0 last 
Saturday bore but one resemblance— 
that of names of players—to the real 
Tech Varsity. Everything that our 
team is supposed to have, and really 
showed against Waynesburg, was 
lacking, even the fighting spirit. 
Flashes of this were shown, rather 
widely distributed throughout the con­
test, and, when present, made the 
Geneva team look foolish.
Even with our team apathetic, Ge­
neva outplayed our men only in the 
handling of forward passes. All four 
of their touchdowns were the result 
of sensational throws, three of them 
being made through catches that were 
nothing short of miraculous. Although 
the element of luck was so evident, 
credit must be given to the Geneva 
men for being on the job to take ad­
vantage of the breaks.
During the first quarter, neither 
team gained materially and were 
forced to resort to punting repeated­
ly. The second period opened with 
the ball in Geneva’s possesion on Car­
negie’s 40-yard line. Geneva backs 
gained but five yards on three tries, 
then Park and Dodds worked a for­
ward pass that netted 18 yards. After 
two more ineffectual tries at Tech’s 
line, Dodds passed the ball to Mc- 
Danel, who was back of the line. 
The receiver of the pass reached it, 
almost with his finger tips, and fell, 
scarcely knowing that he had the ball. 
Dodds kicked an easy goal from 
placement.
After Dodds kicked off, Kreider, 
Balsinger and McCaughey were held 
successively for no gain, so Burke 
kicked. Dodds caught and ran the 
ball back 30’ yards to Carnegie’s 20- 
yard line. After a gain and a loss, 
Park started a forward pass, but 
Burke intercepted it on the 10-yard 
line. Burke’s punt went low and Park 
stopped with it 23 yards from 
Tech’s goal. Dodds gained but one 
yard at tackle, but, on the next down 
started a forward pass toward his op­
ponent’s goal line. The ball fell into 
McDanel’s unsuspecting arms and he 
had nothing else to do but run five 
yards for a touchdown, inasmuch as 
he was alone in that particular part 
of the field. Credit must be given to
the passers of these two scoring 
throws, but the- attitude of McDanel 
on both occasions seemed to indicate 
that either he or the backs had mixed 
the signals and the success of the 
plays was nothing but “happenstance.” 
Dodds again kicked an easy place­
ment goal, making the score 14 to 0.
Burke kicked off this time and 
Dodds returned 24 yards to Geneva’s 
39-line. Geneva was penalized for 
off-side play and failed to gain on 
second down. Dodds punted out of 
bounds 43 yards from Tech’s goal. 
Kreider was thrown for a four-yard 
loss, but Balsinger gained 10 units. 
McCaughey failed' at the line, then 
started a forward pass. Marshall 
caught the ball and ran, almost un­
molested, for 55 yards to a touchdown. 
Dodds kicked the goal.
The remaining few seconds of play 
of the. first half were occupied by un­
successful attempts of Geneva’s to 
gain by carrying the. ball.
In the third quarter, Trautman fum­
bled the kick-off and Geneva recov­
ered on Carnegie’s 30-yard line. Ge­
neva could not gain on three downs 
and Dodds punted to McDonald, who 
stopped on Tech’s 15-mark. Burke 
punted in return to Geneva’s 45-line. 
Quay, a new man in the game, re­
placing Dodds, circled Carnegie’s left 
end for 15 yards. Park started a for­
ward pass toward Quay, but McDon­
ald intercepted the ball and returned
5 yards to Tech’s 20-yard line. Mc­
Caughey and McDonald wrere thrown 
for losses, so Burke punted. Park re­
turned the ball 30 yards to 25 yards 
from Tech’s goal. Park lost 4 yards, 
but a forward pass, Quay to Buchan­
an, gained 5. Park carried the ball 
around Tech’s left end to one yard 
from their goal line. Quay was 
thrown for a loss, then a forward 
pass, Quay to Clyde, scored the fourth 
touchdown, the only one really earned. 
Quay kicked thè goal.
The remainder of the quarter was 
mostly an exchange of punts, inter- 
sperced by attempted forward passes: 
The quarter ended with the ball on 
Geneva’s 35-yard line in their posses­
sion.
Quay and Park were thrown for 
losses totaling 10 yards, then R. Dow- 
nie puntèd, but McCaughey blocked

Mayoralty Candidate Speaks on Cam­

Director Hamerschlag introduced 
the speaker with a short review of his 
political activities. He also stated 
that he hoped to have Mr. Porter’s

then took' the platform and delivered 
an excellent address, extracts from 
which are given below.
“Gentlemen, I am delighted to ap­

know that Mr. Armstrong will appear

great an opportunity to resort to false­
hood and to raise issues which have 
no bearing on the campaign. I have 
tried, even canceling engagements, in 
order to appear before bodies in hope 
that Mr. Armstrong would appear

THE THoSTLEl
We understand that there is to be 
a Thistle "this year, but up to the 
present we have not heard of any 
Editor-in-Chief being elected. The 
Junior class of the Science School 
has already chosen its representatives, 
but the Industries class from which 
the Editor-in-Chief is to be selected 
this year, has elected neither him' nor 
their other representatives.
This is a very important matter, 
because it requires considerable time 
to publish a book such as has ap­
peared in the last few years, and we 
know that the Industries men want 
to keep their book up to the former 
standard. Last year the Editor-in 
Chief and half the Board were elected 
in the latter part of their Sophomore 
year, and still it kept them busy to 
get the book out on time. So we 
would advise that the Junior Indus­
tries class take this matter under con­
sideration and get busy at once.
A íoSASTROUS SURPRoSEl
Reasonable self-confidence is a val­
uable asset; no man succeeds who 
does not believe in his ability to over­
come difficulties. But self-confidence, 
like many other good things, is an 
evil when it is carried to extremes, so 
as to become exaggerated over-con­
fidence.
This was doubtless the reason for 
last Saturday’s defeat. The week be­
fore, our men had played excellently 
and won a good game on a heavy field. 
As a result, they became a little too 
sure of themselves, and thought it 
would be a comparatively easy matter 
to win against Geneva. So they went 
down to Beaver assured in advance 
that they would come back victors. 
But the opposing team tried an ancient 
play, a play which might have origi­
nated among the Chaldaeans if they 
had indulged in football. Strange to 
say, they were successful. Our men 
were evidently too surprised to realize 
what had happened, and this play 
was successfully repeated several 
times. Only once was it broken up, 
and the man who did intercept it is 
to be congratulated against the show­
ing of the others. The result was 
defeat.
We believe the lesson was worth 
the while. Our eleven will now be 
more cautious, and with the memory 
of last Saturday’s defeat, they will go 
into the rest of their games with the 
intention of wiping out the stain, and 
will win the rest of the series, or make 
a brave attempt to do so.
.O ToCKETS—.O AíMoTTA.CE
We are glad to print herewith a 
letter which has been received from 
the Executive Committee of the Board 
of Control. That such a state of af­
fairs existed was unknown to us and 
doubtless is to the great majority of 
students. Of course we know that 
there are certain gentlemen around 
school who believe perfectly well in 
their own abilities, but we do not think 
that the honor they pay to the ath- 
lectic teams and to the students in the 
grandstands by attending the games 
is worth the price of their admittance. 
The letter follows:
“Some of our friends desiring to 
witness the Athletic Contests evident­
ly are of the opinion that our gate­
keepers need assistance, so instead of 
giving a ticket they have been dis­
pensing with a smile or a little “josh­
ing” to obUin admittance. This may 
be all right for public performance 
of professional talent but for school 
events it certainly shows a deplorable 
lack of “school spirit.”
Anyone thinking his personality of 
such strength as to force him into the 
stands, surely, should have enough 
influence with one of the managers 
to obtain the necessary card of admis­
sion and this will be demanded from 
now on.
Every student of the school is giv­
en a book of tickets at the time of 
registration and these tickets should 
not be retained as symbolic of fine 
printing but should be used for ad­
mission to the games, 
it must be said that the number using 
this novel means of entering is very 
small but there is no reason why there 
should be any—so in the future
No Tickets—No Admittance.”
FoRST A..UAL CHESS 
TOUR.AME.Tl
A new thing in the Science School 
is the chess tournament, under the 
direction of C. 'Thomas Patterson, 
now in progress.
Sixteen men are entered, who will 
play each other as in a tennis tourna­
ment. Two weeks are allowed for 
each match which consists of the ma­
jority of five games. The tournament 
will end on December the eighth, 
when the champion chess player of 
the Science School will be determined.
íO.T’S FROM A .oGHT 
STUíE.Tl
Don’t’ spend half you earn upon 
flowers for thoughtless girls. Before 
they wither, such maidens forget who 
gave them.
Don’t be button-holed by every­
body. A little reserve in your man­
ner will often save you annoyance 
from bores.
Don’t consider courtesy merely a 
matter of constant bows and scrapes.
Don’t be indiscreet either in act or 
speech, or you may injure others if 
not yourself.
Don’t neglect the faculty of concen­
tration, for it is the keynote to all 
success.
Don’t be afraid of the smut of labor 
soiling the face or hands.
Don’t whine. Bear pain bravely, 
trouble nobly. Whining boys never 
make forceful men.
Don’t dissipate your efforts. Apply 
yourself to one particular branch of 
trade and become its master.
Don’t think it necessary to be a 
spendthrift in order to be a good fel­
low.
Don’t aim to be an “ideal” boy. Be 
the best type of the real boy.
Don’t be ashamed if your hands 
show work. Lily-like hands are a 
disgrace to a boy.
Don’t fake. A fellow may “bury 
his grandmother” twice, but the next 
time he’ll be out of a job.
CALL FOR MORE TRACK CA.­
íoíATESl
The cross-country candidates had 
their first workout under Coach Hull 
on Tuesday of last week. Before 
starting, he gave the men a few point­
ers and made an appeal for a larger 
squad. He ordered all runners who 
expect to try for the quarter mile 
and the longer distances on the track 
team to report for the fall practice. 
Not more than twenty-five men have 
been out regularly. Considering the 
number of students eligible to par­
ticipate in athletics, this is a very 
small representation of runners. The 
squad should at least be trebled. The 
Plebes particularly should not hesi­
tate to try for the team. If enough 
candidates Report, two squads will 
be formed, a fast and a slow one, so 
that the men who are not accustomed 
to the Ion runs will not become dis­
couraged.

MUSoCAL CLUBS’ SMOKERlíAMROSCH VoSoTS TECHl
The annual smoker given by the 
Musical Club will be held at the Ho­
tel Schenley at 8 o’clock, Saturday 
evening, October 25th
The evening will be spent in good 
talks, music, etc., and is arranged to 
place before the new candidates their 
responsibilities, and how the men are 
to handle little difficulties where they 
are met.
There is nothing that livens the 
hearts of the old men, more than to 
sing and play the old music, to hear 
the old harmony. This smoker is about 
the only time we will have to open up 
on last years’ stuff, because hew mu­
sic is being taken up by both clubs.
Now, any new candidate who has been 
out to two or more rehearsals is eli­
gible to attend this smoker. All old 
men will be on the job with bells. 
Spruce up, men, but don’t wear your 
stiff shirt, this is going to. be entirely 
informal.
WHoTE FRoARS—A..UAL 
MEETo.Gl
Mr. Walter Damrosch, who was at 
the Exposition last week, paid a visit 
to the Design School to inspect the 
building and pass judgment on the 
course in music. His chief topic was 
the graduating of mediocre students. 
The Beaux Arts System was thor­
oughly discussed and it was plainly 
shown that this will obviate any ten­
dency in that direction. He also of­
fered, should he return next year to 
the Expo, to give a series of classical 
concerts for the benefit of Mr. Bur- 
goyne’s class in Aesthetics. Mr. 
Damrosch was very enthusiastic over 
the building and more' so over the 
Music Course and the corps of teach­
ers. He readily accepted the offer of 
Dean Hewlett to return any time he 
was in Pittsburgh.
The White Friars held their first 
meeting of the year on Monday night, 
October 13. About ten of the old 
men were out. Officers for the com­
ing year were elected as follows:
Manager, G. W. Gilpen; President, 
J. A. Cameron; 1st Vice President, 
W. Corbett; 2nd Vice President, W.
B. Chalfont; Treasurer, W. F. 
Wright; Board of Governors, T. D. 
Fitzgibbon, A. C. Bearingerr C. B. 
Kline, J. W. Savage.
Plans for the future were discussed 
and many things brought up but 
nothing decided. The matter of the 
collection that was taken last spring 
to pay off the debts of the club was
discussed and a report was handed
in by ex-Treasurer, Bearinger. This 
report was handed to the Tartan last
spring but was lost and never ap­
peared.

There are still bills outstanding, ac­

to make further annotmcemertts very 
soon as to further activities.
The music department is rapidly 
getting its full cofnpliment of musical 
instruments. These instruments will 
be used for lecture, at. present but 
after New Year’s will be used by the 
Carnegie Concert Orchestra. This 
orchestra will be composed of people 
who have had technical training in 
the Design School. One of the most 
interesting instruments is the new 
Baby Grand Mason and Hamlin 
Piano. This piano is used almost 
exclusively in concert halls all over 
the world and is said to excel even 
the Steinway.
GROVE CoTY COMo.Gl
In the remaining five games on our 
schedule, the Varsity will have the ad­
vantage of the home field, and the 
students will need exert no effort to 
see the contests. All of them will 
be close, being with teams in our 
own class.
Grove City will be here Saturday 
and should be greeted by a record 
crowd. Their team has given us 
trouble in the past, winning two 
games and tying one out of four 
played. The scores have been close 
on both sides, and this year, accord­
ing to advance information, will be no 
exception. They have played but one 
game in their class,—that against 
Waynesburg last week,—and they won 
that rather easily. As we have beaten 
the same team', they can claim little 
advantage. However, it is going to 
be “some game.”
The students made a bad impression 
at the last home game on outside 
spectators by their lack of concerted 
support. We believe that this was 
due to weather conditions, and any 
lack of interest has been improved. 
It is up to the students to justify 
themselves next Saturday. The team 
needs every man in the stands. No 
other plea should be necessary. The 
game starts at 2:30.
The faculty council at Oberlin Col­
lege has limited the number of stu­
dents that may enter the College of 
Arts and Sciences to one thousand.
The U. S. Naval Academy rates 
Spanish as a language of first impor­
tance. Since the Spanish-American 
war the number of students taking 
Spanish in Yale and Harvard has in­
creased 500 per cent.

Miss Breed Writes mn Student Gmv­
ernmentl
My Dear Miss Gubtil:
I have been asked to tell something 
about student government. I fear it 
would take several Tartans to tell 
all there is to say on that subject, 
for student government among women 
at least is now the rule in colleges. 
Even in the lower schools there is 
a movement toward ,even greater re­
sponsibility on the part of pupils, and 
self-goVernment is an essential fea­
ture of the Montessori method for - 
little children. In 'America especially, 
self-government seems the' only logi­
cal system; for it is essentially demo­
cratic, and differs as radically from, 
the old-fashioned faculty discipline as 
a republic does from an autocracy.
It is the Jdea of individual self-con- 
trol that lies at the heart of student 
government., Though a faculty has 
the legal control' of students, it prac­
tically turns over to them all social 
matters and even some purely school 
affairs. The students then are free. 
As self-respecting young women, they 
take each her share of control; Mary 
X. controls Mary X.,„ and Jane Y. 
controls Jane Y. If one of them for­
gets or gets careless, it may be neces­
sary for Sarah Z. to remind them of 
what they ought to do; it might even 
be necessary for a committee to han­
dle some flagrant case of a girl who 
could not be trusted to control her 
own conduct under such a system. 
In women’s colleges, such extreme 
cases are very rare, but when they 
do come up the students njust have 
power to punish offenders. In all the 
colleges that I know of, the student 
government association' has what 
ampuntB to the power of suspension 
or expulsion. - - .
So you see, student government 
means a real student republic, where 
the laws are made at a mass meeting 
of all the citizens, and where the 
judges and officers are elected by uni^ 
versal suffrage. And the faculty 
meantime keep hands off. I have 
known some faculty men and women 
who did not like to keep hands off; 
but when they meddled it was always 
the worse for both them and the stu­
dents. The ideal faculty attitude was 
expressed the other day by the chair­

THE GRA.íl
•Stars of international prestige fea- 
-ture the bill of refined vaudeville 
which, Mr. Harry Davis announces for 
next week beginning Monday after­
noon;'October 27th, in the Grand Op­
era House. Distinctive quality will 
be given the performances by Burt 
Clark and Mabel Hamilton, who have 
just arrived from London and are con­
ceded to be the foremost musical 
comedy players of England. They 
are to inaugurate their first American 
tour with this forthcoming week at 
the Grand. Save for a few weeks 
played in New York two years ago, 
when they came to this country sim­
ply for an excursion, Clark and Ham­
ilton have never appeared in any 
"American city. Their vogue in the old 
^world is not equalled by any contem­
porary artists.
-Liflian Shaw, the American carica­
ture comedienne, will be here with a 
group of new character songs. Miss 
Shaw, is the ablest dialect character 
vocalist on the American stage and 
her types of Italian and Hebrew girls 
are presented with a fidelity to nature 
not approximated by any contempo­
rary artiste. The Carl Eugene Troupe, 
consisting of nine people, come from 
Europe for their first American ap­
pearance. The Gardner Trio will in­
troduce the latest society dances— 
‘‘The Love- Waltz,” “Turkey Trot,” 
“Flirtation Polka,” the Tango Solo 
and the cowboy, “Texas Tommy.” 
They are the most proficient exem­
plars of the ultra-modern style of 
Terpsichore. There will be many 
other features in the week’s program 
that will prove both attractive and 
novel.

FoRST MEETo.G OF MHO CLUB.oGHT PREP CLASSl
About twenty-five members attend­
ed the first meeting of the Mho 
Club, held Wednesday evening, Oc­
tober fifteenth. After the election' of 
officers, a discussion was carried on, 
as to the advisability of having two 
meetings- a month instead of one, the 
first meeting to be of a technical, 
nature and the second to be dev.Qt.ed 
to social and non-technical purposes. 
Though nothing definite was decided,, 
the general opinion favored the two 
meetings and this plan will probably 
be put into affect temporarily, at 
least. The results of the election were 
as follows:
President—Sontum.
Vice President—Dougherty. 
Secretary-T reasurer—Dunbar. 
Executive Committee—Diehl, Wil­
son, Gumbart.

The Design School Library has been 
enriched by the purchase of the most 
authoritative work in existence, a 
treatise on Egypt.’ This work was 
compiled and printed for Napoleon in 
the early nineteenth century. Not 
only was it possible to get the books 
but also the paper and letter press. 
The latter, in themselves, would be 
an ornament and antique of great 
value to any library. The beautiful 
steel engravings of Architecture, Dec­
oration, and Natural History are be­
yond praise.
Friday evening, October 10th, Night 
Preparatory class made their debut 
for the year 1913*1914.
The class is much larger than, the 
class of 1912-1913. The ciass looks 
like one having lots of “pep” for good 
old Carnegie. (Let’s hope so.) The 
class-had regular class work from 
7:30 to-9:30 P. M. when they all as- 
sembfed i-ift .‘Room 104 to hear the ad­
dress by Director. Hamerschlag; All 
seemed to enjoy the* address immense­
ly and went home better tuned for the 
hard year’s, work which follows this 
inaugural work. r
The class is not yet organized but 
will some time in the near future. An­
nouncement of election will be made 
later.
From the looks of the class it will 
be of use to the College in many 
ways. There are some well-built, 
strong, robust looking fellows who 
can be of use in athletics and others 
who are artists in music. It is hoped 
that this class can do something to 
bring “glory” to Carnegie in some 
way.

my mind naturally turned to the 
broader congressional field and the 
idea of entering the mayoralty field 
never entered my head until men 
called upon me. The reason men 
called upon me was my well known 
hostility to the state machine, and 
my experience in behalf of progressive 
legislation at Harrisburg last year 
The legislation which was enacted 
last year put the state back ten years 
and increased the discontent of the 
people. In 1906 after defeat of the 
registration act, the uniform primar­
ies act was very careful to omit state 
offices, with the result that state con­
ventions still exist, and the conven­
tion for making party nominations 
has been a curse.
“But as to the progressive legis­
lation. The state committee was 
called and I was made chairman. If 
you will take the trouble to read the 
platform and I hope you will, you will 
find it very specific. A committee of 
fifteen men was appointed to have the 
legislation ready when the legislature 
convened. In this legislation ap­
peared the public utilities bill. The 
bills went in to the house and passed, 
but in the Senate the corrupt prac­
tices act was defeated, the child labor 
bill emasculated, and the woman’s la­
bor bill practically killed. These 
measures all hit at one thing and that 
is the public service corporation. Your 
trouble is not here, your trouble is at 
Harrisburg. Our public utilities bill 
is only one remedy for the ills which 
we suffer from the hands of these 
people.
“The public utilities bill was amend­
ed until we are really in worse shape 
than we were before.
“The Legislature in 1904 passed a 
bill allowing Pittsburgh railways; to 
carry freight, but they refused to do 
so except for newspapers. They 
started to carry newspapers and the 
moment the papers criticised the com­
pany they were warned to be careful. 
A year ago the “Leader” published a 
lot of news about the operations of 
the company, and the company issued 
an order to refuse to carry the 
“Leader.” The editor went to court, 
and the court handed down a decision, 
which I consider very remarkable, in 
that it was optional.
“Now, a word about home rule. Our 
courts have repeatedly held that the 
city was without inherent power, only 
an arm of the state, and as an arm1, 
could do nothing without legislation. 
The Legislature uses the same power 
over Pittsburgh that, for example, the 
Board of Directors of the U. S. Steel 
Corporation exercises over the super­
intendent of a furnace. Now, this is 
alright for the U. S. Steel Corpora­
tion, but bad for a city like Pitts­
burgh. The system may have once 
been alright, but today, when the 
government of our great cities is the 
problem of the United States, the city 
is in the power of those who have no 
interest in the city. The legislature 
is made up of people who know noth­
ing about city needs. Pittsburgh has

genius enough to govern without help 
from Harrisburg.
“Now, to show you how it affects 
you in taxation. We complain about 
taxes, and it is unfortunately neces­
sary that our taxes are higher than 
those of a city like Cleveland, on ac­
count of damage suits, and the fire 
system, etc., but do you know that 
$22,000,000 worth of property used by 
public service corporations is exempt 
from taxation? Back in the early days 
we were willing to help railroads and 
Pittsburgh is the only city, by act of 
1859, that has the power to tax rail­
roads, but for some strange reason 
the city never saw fit to do it until 
four years ago. The assessment was 
made and the railroads protested if, 
on the grounds that the city by not 
taking advantage of the act, repealed 
it. At any rate they got the right of 
way from under the act of taxation.
I had always advocated annexation of 
the North Side, where the millage is 
higher than in Pittsburgh, because I 
knew the railroads could be taxed. 
The railroads contested and the court 
held that the tax could be applied 
only to the old city of Pittsburgh.
“The telephone and light companies 
are exempt from taxation, and if any 
man can give me a reason why the 
Bell Telephone should not be taxed 
and my home should, I’ll admit that 
I am wrong.
“The courts hold that these com­
panies are public or quasi-public com­
panies when we try to tax them, but 
when we attempt to regulate their 
service we are told that they are pri­
vate corporations.
“In this campaign I have five news­
papers opposing me, three of which 
are controlled by Senator Oliver, 
while the Teners are interested in the 
railways. I want to ask you as citi­
zens of Pittsburgh, I know you want 
to vote right, I know many of you 
read the newspapers, to go to one of 
my opponent’s speeches and then read 
his speech in the morning “Gazette”

TECH IN THE LIMELIGHT AT 
CHICAGO.
The Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology came into considerable prom­
inence at the convention of the Amer­
ican Foundryman’s Association, held 
in Chicago last week, as a result of 
a paper read before that body by 
Dean Connelley. The theme of the 
paper was, “The Part that the Car­
negie Institute of Technology plays 
in the Development of Modern Foun­
dry Practice.”
. The Dean showed that the School 
foundry is interpreting the meaning 
of foundry practice in a manner in 
keeping with the age in which we live. 
He said, “It is doing its share in 
serving as a clearing' house for the 
publicity of what a model foundry 
should be; second, for the securing 
of a new and better type of foundry- 
men; third, for creating a sympa­
thetic interest in the work of a foun- 
dryman; fourth, for inculcating the 
idea of safety and accident preven­
tion; fifth, for bringing together prac­
tical foundrymen to work the prob­
lems of future men for the trade; 
and sixth, for encouraging uniform 
customs and actions among present 
and future foundrymen.
MERCER SPEAKS 
TO STUDENTS.
Edward C. Mercer, better known 
among college men all over this coun­

with the hearts of about 300 students 
of the School of Applied Industries 
last Friday morning, by his straight­
forward talk on College Morals and 
Ethics. Mr. Mercer gave a brief 
sketch of his life as a University stu­
dent, and showed the pitfalls from 
his own experience that surround the 
students’ life. His address was lis­
tened to with considerable interest 
and after the talk most of the stu­
dents personally thanked Mr. Mercer 
for the helpful advice given. In the 
absence of Dean Connelley, who was 
in Chicago, Mr. Hartman presided 
over the meeting.

FIFTH YEAR NIGHT CLASS 
ELECTION.
Under a threatening sky and on a 
muddy field Central High walloped 
their rivals, Fifth Avenue High, to the 
score of 44—0, on Tech field Satur­
day morning at 10:30.
During the first half, Central 
played mediocre ball, scoring only six 
points, in the second quarter; but in 
the last half they took Fifth Avenue 
off their feet with six touchdowns. 
Long end runs were the principal 
sources of points. Glick, brother to 
Glick of the Princeton eleven and 
this year a freshman at Central took 
the ball from their ten-yard line on 
a kickoff, ninety yards for a touch­
down.
Fifth Avenue’s line was particularly 
weak, and the score would have been 
much worse had it not been for their 
left half back, Stevenson, whose hard, 
sure tackling prevented many a 
touchdown.
Dr. Marks umpired the game and 
Tech was otherwise represented by 
quite a number of spectators, many 
of whom were graduates of Fifth 
Avenue or Central.
There are 747 men in the Yale 
freshman class, 391 in the academic 
and 356 in the scientific 
school. Of the preparatory schools 
entering men, New Haven high school 
ranks first with 81 and Andover sec­
ond with 70.
The Fifth Year Night Class held its 
initial meeting recently. Officers 
were elected, after which a regular 
business meeting was held. The sub­
ject of social meetings provoked con­
siderable discussion. It was finally 
decided to have a social meeting once 
a month during the school term. The 
first of these will be held on the 
evening of November first at a place 
to be decided later. The following 
officers were eleceteu:
Win. R. Dolan, President.
C. B. Huggins, Vice President.
C. A. Trotter, Secretary.
D. G. Marsh, Treasurer.
A. V. Dolan, Historian.

the kick. After the scramble, it was 
decided that Geneva had the ball on 
their 25-yard line. Geneva failed to 
make distance and Downie punted, 
Balsinger catching the ball on our 
30-mark. McCaughey could not gain, 
but Balsinger made 25 yards on an end 
run. Kreider failed and three succes­
sive forward passes were unsuccess­
ful. Geneva was penalized for off­
side, and two more downs failed to 
gain for them. On the fourth down, 
a forward pass, Quay to McDanel, put 
the ball on Tech’s 45-yard line. Mar­
shall made 5 units, and another throw, 
Quay to McDanel, added 10 yards. 
Quay made an end run for 18 yards, 
being stopped by' Parke, who took 
Balsinger’s place, 12 yards from our 
goal. A forward pass failed, and 
Quay negotiated 2 yards. McCaughey 
spoiled another pass, and Dodds was 
sent in to try for a field goal. The 
kick was low and Tech blocked and 
recovered two yards from their goal. 
McCaughey punted out of danger and 
Carnegie held the Geneva team1 for 
the remaining few minutes of play.
The entire Tech back field was slow 
in starting and could not get up speed 
before the line was reached. Bal­
singer was the only back to put up 
a creditable game, but he was forced 
often to run without a semblance of 
interference. Fulmer was the was the 
only man on the line to play a uni­
formly good game. Burke finished 
better than he started and was really 
playing by the time the game was 
over. Fagan helped to keep the team 
alive, having the only evident supply 
of ‘‘pep.” Over-confidence may be 
blamed for most of the troubles of 
the team, as no other apparent reason 
exists for the lack of victory, much 
less for the loss of the game. Park, 
last year’s Tech halfback, and Dodds 
starred for Geneva.

SPORTING COMMENT.
Pitt and Washington and Jefferson 
opened up surprise bags last Satur­
day. Both teams must be even better 
than their press-agents try to pic­
ture them.
Capt. George Flick, of the Lehigh 
eleven, had his collarbone broken in 
the game with Yale last week. Flick 
was a halfback on our famous 1909 
team.
Grove City beat Waynesburg 34 to 
0 on Saturday, which puts the dopes- 
ters busy on our game with the for­
mer team next Saturday. The scores 
34 and 18 give the odds to the visi­
tors. Now to spill the dope-pot.

CLASSoFoEí LoST OF TARTA. AíVERToSERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi­
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom' 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re­
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.
