“'Studies Upon the Widmanstatteu 
Structure IV, the Iron-Carbon Al­
loys,” In New York City, tomorrow, 
before the scientific meeting of 
the Iron and Steel Division of the 
American Institute of Mining and 
Metallurgical Engineers. This is 
the fourth paper in a series, pub-, 
Ushed during the last three years, 
and the subject is one which the 
Research Bureau has been study­
ing for some time.
Accompanying Dr. Mehl will be 
Dr. C. L. Barrett and Dr. D. W. 
Smith, both from the Bureau of 
Metallurgical Research. The three 
•will present discussions to various 
scientific research papers. Dr. 
Mehl. who will preside over the 
meeting of the Institute of Metals 
Divisions, will visit the American 
Brass Company at Waterbury, Con­

The annual Interfraternity For­
mal will be held on March 10, 1933, 
in either the William Penn Hotel 
or Hotel Schenley. The committee 
for the dance, consisting of Ira F. 
Kuhn, chairman; William H. 
Hauser, John C. Liglitfoot, and 
Robert E. Robinson, has not 
reached a definite decision about 
the band or the price of admission. 
It is possible this year to make 
the - price lower - than -ever"-before? 
because of the lower prices for 
dance bands and other necessary 
costs for the dance. The dance 
committee is now in correspond­
ence with the national booking of­
fices to obtain the best band at a 
reasonable price.
As in former years, the Interfra­
ternity Formal will be a colorful 
affair. The scheme for decorations 
Include the placing of the numer­
ous fraternity banners around the 
ballroom. Mr. Llghtfoot will have 
charge of the decorations and all 
fraternities are requested to hand 
tlieir banners to him before March 
first. __________________

Professor Hickman to Direct 
Production of Milne’s 
Amusing Fantasy
Members of the Drama Depart­
ment, supervised by Mr. E. W- 
Hickman, assistant professor, are 
preparing to present “The Ivory 
Door,” a play written by A. A. 
Milne. The presentation, which 
formerly had a long run in Eng­
land, will begin this Saturday and 
continue for one week.
The play, popularly termed a 
fantasy, is a children’s play writ­
ten for older persons. • The object 
of presenting this type of play Is 
to train the cast members in the 
art of acting light comedy. In plot 
the play is extremely light and 
amusing.
The scene is laid in a king’s 
palace, with a medieval setting in 
a country of your own choice. 
Around a strange legend of a 
charmed ivory door the entire plot, 
is built. This legend, accepted asj 
true by the people in the play, 
maintains that evil spirits lurking 
behind the Ivory Door will im­
prison all unlucky enough to pass 
through it. The action of the play 
commences when King Perivale, a 
handsome young man who is be­
trothed to a lovely princess, en­
ters the door. He wishes to dis­
prove the time-honored legend, and 
hence risks his life by casting 
side his friends’ warnings. The 
numerous complications resulting 
from Ills action make the play an 
impossible and thoroughly amusing 
affair.
The cast is as follows: King 
Hilary, Boyd Crawford, Thomas 
Gorman; Prince Perivale (as 
a childi), Jane Witmer; Brand, 
Em anuel Breakstone, Boyd 
Crawford; The chancellor, De 
Lisle Crawford, Robert Gill;

Knoivledge of Institution Inmates 
Displayed in Recent Examinations
Some one said that we just 
^finished a week of final exams— 
exam week—a week in which 
•exams were taken. Exams? What 
are they? Oh, you mean those 
sheets of questions each instruc­
tor banned, out to each member, of 
his classes? He also gave each 
one a little blue book, didn’t he? 
That's right, wo sort’a remember 
something like that happening a 
couple o’ weeks ago.
Those questions were all so nice, 
weren’t they? Just what every­
one expected, and just what every­
one wanted. They Avero such easy 
questions too. Why. everyone 
knew simply everything, and really 
the intelligent answers were as­
tounding. The teachers must have 
been terribly bored, not getting a 
single queer answer to amuse 
them. Perhaps it would be a good 
idea to slip in a funny answer or 
two in the next exams, just to 
keep all of the instructors in a 
good humor. They certainly 
would enjoy it.
The little blue books are awfully 
ift{je too. Their covers are made 
of '¿lie prettiest blue paper—just 
the shade for a new Spring dress 
or perhaps “for a new Easter neck­
tie. The paper inside the covers
By ANNA LADD
is so glossy, and the lines of the 
paper are spaced in such an 
even manner that even the most 
manly scrawl appears to be in its 
proper place. Then there is 
usually exactly the right number 
of pages , of this carefully ¦ lined 
paper in the blue books—hardly 
ever too much or too little. In 
case some one does write more 
than enough to fill one book, the 
Instructor is always more than 
glad to give you the second. Now, 
it isn't everyone who would do as 
much for you!
It is such fun getting ready for 
the exams. The night before, or 
perhaps two nights before, the day 
a test is to be given, it is the most 
fun leafing through several books 
and stacks of neatly arranged 
notes and finding all that you 
know—much to your surprise. 
Why you never realized that you 
knew so much all at one time. 
Strange things do happen! Then, 
when mother or roommate pokes 
his head over your shoulder at 
about 3 o’clock the next morning, 
and wants to have a good time 
too, you send him away “to mind 
his own business.” You want to 
have the fun all by your self. The

ion of a Student” as the subject 
of his talk. All girls in the “Y” 
cabinet who are interested are in­
vited to attend this assembly.
The Freshman “Y” Cabinet will

Last Year’s Production 
Is Being Considered 
by the N.B.C.
The National Broadcasting Com* 
pany, through the orchestra agency 
of Van-Sneeden, Inc., has asked 
The Bacchanalians, the student or­
ganization which produces the 
Spring, Camiyal'.musical revue, to 
submit the book, lyrics, and music 
of their 1932 show, “Tar and 
Feathers,” for consideration for a 
series of broadcasts of collegiate 
musical shows. The broadcasts, 
which will run over a period of 
fifteen weeks, will have the Co­
lumbia University Varsity Club 
show of 1927, “Betty Behave.” for 
the initial performance.
Herman Liveriglit ’33, one of the 
Executive Committee of The Bac­
chanalians, conferred with a repre- 
resentative of the broadcasting 
firm in New York last week. The 
material for the broadcast is now 
being assembled and an announce­
ment of the date of the broadcast 
will be published in the Tartan as 
soon as it is definitely settled.
The Bacchanalians feel that this 
broadcast will be an excellent op­
portunity to advertise the produc­
tion which is now in rehearsal, and 
which will be produced as the final 
event of Campus Week during 
May. Bill Bales '33, has been hold­
ing regular rehearsals of the danc­
ing chorus and announces that 
there will be a rehearsal in the 
Union, Administration Building, on 
Sunday evening, February 26, at 
7:30 p. m.
Last year’s production, “Tar and 
Feathers, was presented In the 
manner of a sophisticated revue. 
It was written, composed, and 
managed by students of the De­
partments of Music, Drama, and 
Painting and Decoration. The pro­
gram consisted of several original 
dances, take-offs, arid humorous 
and satirical sketches, among them 
a satire on Eugene O’Neill’s 
“Mourning Becomes Electra,” and 
a parody of the then popular Ber- 
nie-Wincliell radio battle. All 
music, as well as setting and 
sketches, for the revue was 
original.

CAMPUS PERSONALITIES
BY STANTON WILLIAMS
Dr. Joseph H. James, Head of 
the Department of Chemical En­
gineering and the second of the 
four remaining appointees to Car­
negie, was born in Jeffersonville, 
Ohio. He graduated from Buchtel 
College (now the University of 
Akron) in 1894 with a B. S. degree 
and then taught Chemistry and 
Physics there 
three years. 
Having done 
graduate work 
a t Columbia 
and Pennsyl­
vania for two 
years he re­
ceived his Ph. 
D. degree 
from the lat­
ter University 
in 1899.
After Dr. 
James had 
served as 
Chief Chemist 
for the Lake 
Superior Power Company at Sault 
Ste. Marie, Ontario, he went to the 
South Carolina A. E. M. College in 
Clemson, S. C., to teach in the 
Textile Department. His teaching 
here was concerned with the 
bleaching and dying of cotton, and
Dr. James
lasted from 1902 to 1905. He then 
was appointed to Carnegie as 
Assistant Professor of Chemistry.
At this time the Chemistry Lab­
oratories were being planned in 
offices in the old German Bank 
Building; in the fall they were set 
up in the Industries Building. The 
following year Dr. James became 
Head of the Department.
Much of Dr. James’ activities 
have consisted of litigation in con­
nection with gas explosions or 
with patents. He has discovered 
a safe method for the storing of 
acetylene, developed the idea, and 
organized a company for its appli­
cation. His research and com­
mercial development of processes 
for making products from the 
petroleum hydrocarbons is still 
progressing, and has met with suc­
cess in several instances.
One of his interesting discov­
eries was an ingredient for ethyl 
alcohol which renders it impotable 
without changing its effectiveness 
for commercial purposes. During 
the early prohibition days he was 
active in the American Society of 
Chemical Engineers in seeking 
means to prevent the drinking of 
the dangerous methyl alcohol.
Dr. James is a self-styled “rabid

Dr. Ross Decries Inefficiency 
In Public Administration
Declares Political Death Should be Lot of Incapa­
ble Leaders; Urgent Need for Tests 
Of Candidates' Ability Seen
Depressions subject all govern­
ments to criticism. Neither the 
newborn German government, the 
French Republic nor the American 
counterpart of democracy is ex­
empt. Perhaps criticism in the 
United States has taken on a par­
ticularly bitter tone by reason of 
the dissillusionment among those 
who misplaced confidence in the 
rich words of promise that came 
from our national leaders. At any 
rate criticism of our form of gov­
ernment has run the gamut of 
vulnerability from the salaries paid 
to congressmen’s wives who do no 
public work, to the depths of muni­
cipal degradation where crooked 
judges, .magistrates and disreputa­
ble mayors are frequently discov­
ered and sometimes punished. 
When one surveys the familiar 
scene of governmental maladmin­
istration and at the same time
bears in mind that government is 
supposedly an apparatus for the 
production of human welfare, not 
illfare, the situation seems a bit 
ironic. And in addition it is down 
right disconcerting to those who 
have any affection for our present 
institutions.
If one were asked to get behind 
the symptoms of inefficient opera­
tion of the democratic apparatus 
and name the weaknesses of 
democracy that give us our crop 
of shoddy machine politicians, 
gaudy mayors, grafters and other 
elements of governmental illfare, 
probably first mention should go 
to the tests by which we choose 
our office holders and the examina­
tions that determine whether or 
not they rtetain their offices. •
In the'first instance the test con­
sists of the ability to get votes and 
in the second it consists of the 
ability to keep on getting votes. 
The vote-getting test unfortunately 
has no necessary relation to the 
ability or willingness of the indi-

the present needs for Its use, is in­
efficient. Joseph R. Vensel '33, 
ended the meeting by summing up 
the high speed accomplishments 
of the world. He remarked that 
low wing .planes offer many struc­
tural strength advantages and that 
the increase in drag incurred be- 
comes negligible at higher speeds.

Babies, Students, Entire Families
Demoralized by Jig Saw Puzzles
By LITTITIA
Jig saws have so upset our na­
tional equilibrium that even the 
youngsters have substituted these 
two little words for the interna­
tionally famous “see saw” of Moth­
er Goose rhymes. This, of course, 
testifies to the fact that the babies 
of the families haven't the slight­
est idea of the meaning of either 
phrase; but then—neither have we.
We have always thought jigs to 
be some sort of Irish lilt In which 
one diops from one foot to another 
in imitation of the Davy Jones, ef­
forts which are more stilted than 
lilted; ana as for saws, what with 
all the talk of shops and so on, and 
all the legends of Lincoln, we can 
hardly underestimate their value 
and their economic importance as 
instruments for slicing things 
apart. The two together seem 
rather an incongruous mixture, 
yet we must let them pass under 
the wing of the old adage which 
states that opposites attract.
And despite their incongruity 
they've taken the world by storm. 
Unfortunately, the jig saw puzzle 
fad became the great American 
racket just preceding final exams, 
luring the student from the safety 
of his literary pursuits to the dan­
ger zone of illicit amusement.
LYTELLE
Paints lay drying and slide rules 
lay pining for a little action and 
their daily dozen as Carnegians 
pored over the Innumerable, misro- 
scoplc pieces of cardboard which 
would reveal, after hours of hard 
labor, a picture showing anything 
from Santa Claus falling into a 
chimney to sunset over Ball.
We used to become quite dis­
gusted to see otherwise normal 
people sit hunched up, and gazing 
with concern, over the shapely 
minuteness of the jig saw puzzles 
until one loyal fan pointed out 
their usefulness in teaching tlio 
devotee how to concentrate. It 
seems that concentration doesn't 
require the use of one’s cranial 
faculties, that all that is necessary 
to achieve the effect is an Intense 
glare plus rounded shoulders plus 
a chin cupped in one's palms. In 
fact, we expect the advertisers 
soon to use as their slogan: “Con­
centrate the Jig Saw Puzzle Way.”
About the only person whom we 
found to need a little concentration 
was the freshman who remarked 
that she always thought that “Jig” 
was a feminine name, "Saw” the 
past tense of an irregular verb, 
and “puzzles” the object of Jig's 
scrutiny.

International Art Exhibition 
Will Re-open on October 19
Award, Jury to Choose 
Best Paintings and 
Garden Scene
By ANNA LADD
The International Exhibition of 
Paintings, usually hold each your 
in the Art Galleries of Carnegie In­
stitute, will be resumed this year 
after an interval of a year. The 
exhibition, which will bo the 
Thirty-first International in the his­
tory of Carnegie Institute, will 
open on October 10 and continue 
through December 10. This an­
nouncement was made at the 
Carnegie Institute February 0 after 
the Fine Arts Committee of the 
Trustees' had approved the plans 
for the exhibition.
The exhibtion will consist of. 
about 350 paintings of which 125 
will be from the United States and 
225 from European countrie». All 
of the artistH whoso paintings arc 
to hang in the exhibition will bo di­
rectly invited by the Fine Arts De­
partment of the Institute. As in 
former yearn, there will be a jury 
of award which is to consist of 
three directors chosen from Ameri­
can art museums.
The prizes to bo awarded for the 
three best paintings are $1,500 for 
the first prize, $1,000 for the sec­
ond, and $500 for tlio third. In ad­
dition to these InHtitute prizes, the ; 
Garden Club of Allegheny County 
will offer a prize of $300 for the 
best; painting of a llower garden.
Homer Saint-Gaudens, Director 
of the Department of Fine Arts 
at the Institute, will leave for 
Europe in the early part of March 
to visit artists in the European 
countries who will be represented 
in the International Exhibition.
French Dept. 
Faculty Plans 
Many Changes
Instructors Will Reward 
Good Performance 
By Exemptions
The faculty of the Department 
of Modern Languages at a recent 
meeting made plana for several 
changes in their courses of study 
that will be put Into effect this 
Hemester and that are of particular 
interost to students studying 
French.
Ono of the changes applying to 
all courses Is that those students 
who, in the opinion of their own 
instructor, have doin' faithful work 
of outstanding quality during tho 
semestor, and have boon relatively 
prompt In their attendance of 
classes, will not lie roqulrod to 
talco a final examination. Several 
members of tho department havo 
foil; for iiomo time that this plan 
ought to lie offered as a reward for 
good performance In tho study of 
languages as It Is In other depart­
ments of work, although thoy 
acknowledge that the only benefit 
to tho student would be a roloaso 
from the strain, since the examina­
tion would probably show the 
samo luidoratundlng and ability In 
I he work as had previously boon 
soon.
in the past, the French depart­
ment has offered two courses that 
have boon classified as the study 
of classical and modern French 
Drama and has Included chiefly 
the translation of plays of tho 17th,
18th, and .I Dili centuries with some 
work In composition. With tho 
new semester, however, those 
courses have boon revised to in­
clude an understand Ini of tho lit­
erature of the period studied as 
well as tho setting or background 
of tho particular piece. Tho selec­
tion of the works to bo read will 
bo principally determined by the 
students and will not bo limited to 
plays alone.
The French division at the pres­
ent time offers enough courses to 
enable a student to teach French 
in the public schools of Pennsyl­
vania provided the student at the 
same time completes the require­
ments in educational studies.. The 
State of Pennsylvania demands 
three years of college French for 
a certificate of teaching in that 
language, but the language depart­
ment feels- that it is more advisa­
ble that a student have at least 
•five or six years of study out of 
•the seven that are available in 
order to have some mastery of 
their subject.
There have. not. been enough stu­
dents wanting further study in Ger- 
-raan, Spanish, and Italian to war- 
- rant the offering of advanced 
courses in these languages, but 
.whenever possible the Department 
of languages will offer work to 
meet the requests of any group of 
students desiring further study
Art Exhibition 
Opened Here 
Last Thursday
Display Includes Works 
Of Former Carnegie 
Institute Trustee
Two exhibition*. or paintings 
opened Thursday morning at the 
Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie 
Institute Art Galleries, and will 
continue through March 30. The 
first of these is an exhibition of 
paintings by the late Joseph It. 
Woodwoll. Mr. Woodwell, who 
died in 1911, was ono of Pitts­
burgh’s most distinguished artists. 
Ho was one of tho original trus­
tees of the Carnegie Institute and 
served as a member of its Fine 
Arts Committee for fifteen years, 
serving as chairman for the last 
two years of his life.
Mr. Woodwell was one of the 
first Pittsburgh artists to study in 
Europe. He was a friend of the 
leading members of both the Bar- 
blzon and Impressionistic school'of 
painting. During his sbjourn in 
Europe he came to know Alfred 
Sisley, Camille Pissarro, Itevoir. 
RIdgway Knight, Millet, and 
Monet, all well-known figures. His 
daughter, Mrs. James D. I-Iailman, 
is also ii well-known Pittsburgh 
artist.
The second exhibition is one 
showing a group of paintings by 
Cleveland artists. The paintings 
were selected from the annual ex­
hibition of the work of Cleveland 
artists which is held each May un­
der the auspices of tho Cleveland 
Museum of Art. .
Tills Is the first time that a 
group of paintings by Cleveland 
artists has ever been exhibited at 
the Institute. The exhibit will bo 
of particular interest because the 
annual exhibition of the Associated 
Artists of Pittsburgh is also being 
held at the Institute.

Tartan’s First Edition Over Quarter 
Century Ago Unlike Present Issue
By GWEN HADDOCK
The first issuf) of tho Carnogio 
Tartan was published on October 
2-1, 1006. its purpose was well ex­
pressed In the following articlo 
written by the editor:
“It is fitting and proper at this 
time, when wo send forth tho first 
issue of the Tartan, that tho stu­
dents be informed of our purpose 
and tho things wo, the editors, 
stand for, as in any venture of this 
kind the success or failure de­
pends upon the attitude and spirit 
in which it is received by those 
whom it reaches. The editors do 
not stand in the position of sup­
pliants; they take the stand, 
rather, of those who are ready to 
deliver the goods. It is the in­
tention of the editors to place be­
fore the student body not only 
those events which have happened 
but newsy items of events to oome. 
We have the patronage of our fac­
ulty, and hope to draw upon them 
for an occasional essay, which we 
have no hesitation in saying will 
be interesting to all the men. Out­
side talent will also be secured,
and the Tartan will prove its right, 
to tho t.ltlo of Official Organ of 
Carnogo Technical School."
During the first year the Tartan 
came out In an eight, pago maga­
zine 9"xl2” In size, which sold at 
five cents a copy. The most im 
portant nows, usually football or 
sport features, . tilled the ojitlro 
front pago. The rest of tho paper 
was made up of miscellaneous per­
sonal items, jokes, pictures, edi­
torials, and advertisements.
In tho second year, the Tartan 
Increased to a sixteen-page maga­
zine selling at ten cents a copy. 
Each week a faculty member’s 
picture was featured on the cover. 
The news was divided into class 
and school news, each class and 
each school having a separate col­
umn. “Pertinent and Impertinent,” 
similar to “From the Fence,” car­
ried personal items and jokes.
The student body expressed its 
literary efforts in poetry, songs, es­
says, and cartoons. Communica­
tion with other schools was held 
through an exchange column.
In comparison with the present

Won. Ills wldo experience in­
cludes the management of such 
musical ventures as; the' first op­
eratic radio performance,,, “Aida,” 
in 1922 the out-of-door production 
of Saint-Saen’s . “Samson' and DelU 
Mi;” and the presentation on suc­
cessive Sundays in May, 1927, over 
a nation-wide hook-up of WABC, 
a double bill of- “Pagliacci” and 
“Caveleria Rustlcanna” and “Aida."
Believing that ‘works of the 
masters belong to tho masses," 
Mr. Frank says that "music lov­
ers must bo given an opportunity 
to soo and hear grand opera at 
prices they can afford. That is 
why I am giving them an opportun­
ity to enjoy our operas at prac­
tically motion picture prices.
Tho company which Mr. Frank 
brings with him Includes —CHAA 
known singers as Anna Lescaya, 
lloslta Fordieii, Porla Dorinl, El­
len Wanlcol, Jean Warron, Giusop- 
po Murtlno-Ronsl, Glovannii Lom­
bardo, Nino Rulsl Eugenio For- 
3sto, Arturo Gorvasi, and Goorge 
rrahert. Goorge Trabert, a natlvo 
of Pittsburgh, has had a note­
worthy operatic carer In lOuropo. 
Mo studied two years with Fernan­
do Carpi, a former Metropolitan 
and Chicago Opora tenor. Later, 
as loading tenor, ho made operatic 
appearances In l’ordonono, Venice,, 
Genoa, and Milan. Ho continued 
Ills sl.uriea by going to Ger­
many and learning the Gorman 
repertoire with Anna, von Mlldon- 
burg. He was admitted to tho 
Academy of Music and presented 
with a scholarship, an honor rare­
ly bestowed upon foreigners. Con­
tinuing big operatic appearances, 
ho Inspired such press comments 
as the following.
Venice, Italy. “With a beautiful 
timbered voice Trabert sang, the 
exacting role of Alfredo in “Tra- 
viata,” with ardor and a master- 
iece of characterization.”
Lille, France. “The American 
tenor George Trabert made a bril­
liant debut in the Lille Opera 
House singing Caravadossi in "La 
Tosca." Again he demonstrated 
that he is an actor of great ability 
and, what is rarer, one of grace 
and charm.—N. de B., Le Journal.
Paris. “A voice of charming 
quality with excellent and free 
high tones. He has a distinguish­
ed appearance, and sings and acts 
with elegance and conviction.”
It is also interesting to note that 
Mr. Trabert was a member of the 
Carnegie Tech Department of 
Drama for the years 1917 and 191S. 
Last summer in Atlantic City, he 
sang a composition of J. Vick 
O’Brien, ‘‘The Stirrup Song.” He 
will sing the role of the Duke in 
“Rlgoletto.”
The committees which Christine 
Loighou, president of the Women’s 
Scholarship Organization, has ap­
pointed are aa follows: Patrons,

By JANE LIVINGSTON
The court of Francis I had the 
qualities of champagne—the effer­
vescent energy, the amber fire, the 
delicate, piquant, teasing art of its 
monarch—and .Victor Hugo, living 
in the nineteenth century and be­
ing fond of the gaiety of the 
renaissance, could not resist writ­
ing a play about "Le Rol S’amuse,” 
the king who ‘‘amuses himself.” 
Nor could Verdi, who became ac­
quainted with the drama about 
1849, resist composing a musical 
score to a libretto based on the 
play.
“Rigoietto” is a story of the 
king’s jester, a vivid tragic tale of 
seduction and villainy, ending in 
the jester’s murder of his own 
daughter. The gloomy violence of 
the subject appealed to the sombre 
nature of Verdi and into the writ­
ing of the music he embodied his 
excessive exuberance and energy 
of temperament. His was a new 
spirit in Italian opera, rough, 
coarse, even vulgar at times, but 
the tremendous force of It made 
It particularly appealing to the pub­
lic of 1848-49. Verdi’s music 
seemed to express for the Italian 
people their longing for independ­
ence from Austrian domination and 
nere was a virility that extended 
beyond the stage and was in strong 
contrast to the gentle Italian sen­
timentality that preceded it. But 
Verdi was to havo diillcultlcs with 
this opera. Tho Austrian censors, 
hearing of it before tho first per­
formance, demanded that it be 
changed, not so much for the 
moral phase of the story as for 
tho political interpretation, given 
It. Tho Austrlans had no desire to 
remind Italy of kings and nation­
alism, not even by tho mention of 
a ruler who had lived three hun­
dred years before, but us Verdi re­
fused to use another text, a com­
promise was arranged whereby a 
¦ French king and his court becume 
that of the Duko of Mantua and, 
the courtiers were no longer 
Frenchnien but Italians. With 
this change, the opera was pro­
duced in Venice on March 11, 1S51 
and became an immediate suc­
cess.
When the curtain rises, the set-’ 
ting is that of a brilliantly lit 
room in the ducal palace where the 
licentious duke who has dishon­
ored the wives and daughters of 
his courtiers, is telling one, Borsa, 
of his infatuation for an unknown 
maiden whom he sees at church 
each Sunday and whom he follows' 
to her home where nightly an un­
known man visits her". The young 
girl is the beautiful Gilda, the 
daughter of Rigoietto, the duke’s 
jester. He, living at court, and 
embittered by the cruel jokes of 
ine courtiers about his deformed 
back, must yet suffer their 
caprices, being able only to anger 
them with his malice. The gaiety 
of the court,is interrupted by tho 
entrance of Monterone who re­
proaches the duke for having be­
trayed his daughter, and the dulco, 
not liking his tone, orders him 
thrown into prison. As he „is led 
out Rigoietto jeers at him and the 
old man uttors a father’s curse on 
tho jestor under which Rigoietto 
cowors.
That evening at. the entrance to
style of the Tartan, the first is­
sues were written informally and 
intimately. The makeup was sim­
ple, and few decked heads were 
used. The circulation has increas­
ed from 2,500 in 1909 to 7,000 to­
day.
his house, Rigoietto meets Spara- 
fucile, an assassin, who offers him 
his services, hut the fool assures 
him that at present he has no such 
need. 1-Ie then enters the garden 
where he soliliquizes that he and 
Sparafucile are brothers, one 
wounds with the dagger, the other 
with his tongue; then, remember­
ing the curse he broods over it un­
til Gilda running into the garden 
to meet him dispels his gloom and 
he becomes the fatherly protector 
charging her never to go into the 
streets except to church. As he 
opens the gate to leave her, the 
duke, disguished as a poor student;, 
slips in and confesses his love for 
Gilda. She in return loves him, 
and when he is forced to leave, her 
by the approach of a noisy crowd, 
she sings to her duenna of her 
love.
Rigoietto, returning home in the 
darkness, meets a crowd of 
courtiers who tell him of a plan to 
abduct someone for the duke. He, 
In his role of buffoon, goes with 
them, not knowing that in reality 
he Is conspiring with the nobles 
for the abduction of his own daugh­
ter, whom they think is Rigoletto’B 
mistress. When the jester dis­
covers what has happened he falls 
fainting to the ground moaning, 
“the curse, the curse.”
The next morning the duke 
laments the disappearance of Gilda, 
but when the courtiers joyously 
tell him of their having captured 
Rlgoietto’s mistress, he recognizes 
from their description that the girl 
is the jester’s daughter and lie sets 
out gaily to find her. As-he leaves, 
Rigoietto enters, and in trying to 
be gay, his inquietude is further 
disturbed by Ills discovery that 
Gilda is with the duke. The 
courtiers, now for the first time 
learning that tho girl is his daugh­
ter, bar him from the duke’s room 
as Gilda rushes out and pathetical­
ly tells her father of her innocent 
deception of him and her present 
betrayal. While ho is comforting 
her, Monterone is brought past on 
his way to the dungeon and he bit­
terly comments that It seems that 
the duke for all his sins is appar­
ently protected by Heaven, but 
Rigoietto promises to revenge them 
both.
To accomplish his vow, the jes­
ter plans that Sparafucile, the 
assassin, shall kill the duke who 
has been enticed into a tavern by 
a pretty wench who is Sparafucile’s 
sister. From the outside Gilda and 
Rigoietto see the duke caress Mad- 
dalena and Gilda in her despair 
permits her father to do anything 
he desires. Then her father bids 
her leave in the guise of a young 
man on horseback for Verona 
where he will join her and going 
out lie completes his scheme with 
Sparafucile. Later Gilda, still 
peering through the crack in the 
wall, hears the gruesome details or 
the plot and as Maddalena pleads 
with her brother to not kill the 
duke who. lies sleeping upstairs, 
Sparafucile agrees to kill instead 
the first stranger who may pass by 
before midnight and ask lodging 
from the storm. Gilda sacrifices 
herself for her lover and it is her 
body that Rigoietto receives and 
which he sets out to throw into the 
river.
The opera ends with the duke 
singing of the fickleness of women 
as he swings down the path and 
Rigoietto, hearing and recognizing 
his voice, opens the sack to find 
instead the body of his Gilda and 
sobbing out his anguish and 
despair at last falls senseless on 
her body.
Sr. Architect Passes

William R. James, Jr., a senior 
In tho Department of Architecture, 
has attracted much attention by his 
success in tho first of three pre­
liminary contests leading to the

Grading Machine Will 
Cut Instructors’ Work
Speaking of exams, a new device 
Is boing shown which will give 
teachers more timo for scholastic 
study by doing all their grading 
of tost papers for them.
Tho machine, called a marko- 
meter, grades the papers and then 
goes on to calculate the percent­
age standing of each one.
With each examination sheet an 
answer sheet is provided the stu­
dents. In a certain column the stu­
dent indicates one of numerous 
possible answers to questions. Iu- 
stead of marking with a pen or 
pencil, though, the student makes 
a small perforation in the proper 
place.
The answer sheets are then in­
serted in the machine. Little 
beams of light passing through the 
perforations control electrical im­
pulses which operate the. dials.—
Crafts Division Presents

Ceramic Society
Printing Dept. 
Seniors Make 
Allied Survey
Many Subjects Covered 
To Complete Senior 
Requirement
The degree seniors in the De­
partment of Printing have recently 
completed their senior theses. 
Harold Cadmus, Jr., made a study 
of shipping problems of book pub­
lishers in the United States. He 
interviewed a number of represen­
tatives of publishing and printing 
organizations in. New York City. 
He secured accurate information 
regarding relationship of printing 
to production and distribution and 
methods in common use for hand­
ling of shipping orders.
John W. Ladd collected data re­
garding different makes of relief 
and offset printing presses. Manu­
facturers of these presses con­
tributed information regarding 
construction, and production pos-' 
sibillties. These data were check­
ed by the records which have been 
compiled in a number of American 
cities regarding' actual perform­
ance of machines.
"Map Making” was the subject 
of a study made by John L. 
Kronenberg, who analyzed various 
methods of engraving and printing 
maps which have been in use in 
Europe and America. Wax engrav­
ing and electrotyping, zinc etching, 
stone and metal lithography and 
photo-lithography and offset, and 
use of movable types for relief 
printing are methods which htyve 
been largely utilized during the 
past century.
John N. Stone made a study of 
recent developments and trends in 
the field of printing papers. With 
the aid of manufacturers and dis­
tributors of bond, book, offset, 
cover, and bristol papers used by 
printers, he analyzed some of the 
general trends in paper manufac­
turing and distributing and also 
studied changes which have been 
taking place in these specific fields.
A movement looking forward 
shifting of emphasis in much of 
the secondary school teaching of 
printing from, interests of the pro­
ducer of printing to those of the 
average user of printing is gaining 
in educational printing circles. 
Ned F. Stirling in his thesis made 
an analysis of possibilities of or­
ganizing high school courses in 
printing in terms of the objective 
‘‘the appreciation of printing.” He 
advocated concentration upon such 
instructional material as would be 
of permanent interest to the aver­
age student who will not make 
printing his vocation hut will al- 
¦Ways remain a user of printed mat­
ter.
Other topics which have been 
studied include the following: A 
historical comparison of national 
advertising layouts .of certain large 
business firms; the part the news­
paper has played in the his­
tory of printing; the develop­
ment of printing machinery and 
processes; a survey of the ma­
terials used in book binding; a 
study of printing type-alloys; a 
history of photo-engraving; an 
analysis of a composing room in a 
large printing plant; the qualifica­
tions of tho printing salesman; 
and a study of the typefoundiug in­
dustry of tho United States.
Three members of the theses 
class have been assisting Profes­
sor Gustafson in the compilation 
of data which will be published 
during the year In paper-bound 
volumes entitled "Who’s Who in 
Printing in tho United States.” 
Questionnaires havo been sent to 
a large number of outstanding men 
in the printing and relative indus­
tries and the information is being 
checked with other sources prior 
to its organization for publication. 
H. P. Pressman, G. A. Pillsbury, 
and S. C. Bussey have been en­
gaged in this work.
Among the many 'exnibits at the- 
thirty-fifth annual convention of 
the American Ceramic Society 
which was held last week at the 
William Penn Hotel was that of 
the Crafts division of Carnegie’s 
Department of Painting and Deco­
rating. This exhibit, which con­
sists of decorative animals and 
figures, plates, vases, and other 
pottery, is the work of juniors and 
seniors who are taking the Normal 
Arts option as well as graduates 
specializing in ceramics. Some of 
the work submitted was that of 
students who have graduated, leav­
ing samples of their work with the 
department.
The American Ceramic Society 
which holds these conventions 
every year in different parts of the 
country is an organization which 
embraces all industries and pro­
fessions associated with the use 
of clay. Besides the exhibits of 
the Arts Division there were those 
of the manufacturers of refrac­
tory materials, glassware, china, 
and many other articles. Along 
with Carnegie’s exhibit in that sec­
tion of the Urban room set aside 
for the Arts Division, was the 
work of Alfred University, Ohio 
State University, and Schenley 
High School of Pittsburgh.
Among those pieces of work 
which received unusual comment 
were" those of Mrs. Dorothy Purse 
Jones and Olivette Hartsfeld. Mrs. 
Jones, a graduate in sculpture who 
specializes in small animal sculp­
ture, exhibited several small ani­
mals of her creation while Miss 
Hartsfeld, also a graduate student* 
submitted a pitcher thrown on the 
potters wheel and finished with a 
black metallic glaze. Another in­
teresting piece was a Scrasito 
plate done in two shades of red. 
Scrasito is a type of pottery in 
which the basic clay is covered 
with, clay of another color, the de-, 
sign being carved through the 
outer layer as in a wood cut.
Riggs and Froclit Co- 
Authors of New 
Mechanics Book
By PENDLETON
Professor Norman C. Riggsr 
head of the Department of Me­
chanics, and Professor Max M- 
Frocht, associate professor of me­
chanics, are collaborating on a 
text on tlie Strength of Materials, 
Ths book will first appear in lith­
oprint and will be. used for about a 
year in this form before the final 
printing is made. The first part 
of the book has already been pub­
lished in lithoprint and is being 
used in E 22, the course in the 
strength of materials given by the 
Mechanics Department. The sec­
ond part of the text will appear 
about the beginning of April. As 
yet no title has been adopted for 
the new text.
Dr. Froclit says in speaking of 
the new book, "Generally speaking 
the science of strength of materials, 
may be divided into three divdsions: 
one dealing with stress anlysis, 
one with the mechanical proper­
ties of materials, and one with the 
theory of failure. Our book will 
concern itself primarily with the 
problem of stress analysis.”
The authors aim to make this 
work thorough from a scientific 
standpoint and at the same time- 
teacliable. This they have accom­
plished by means of a large num­
ber of illustrative problems and 
by a grouping of related topics. 
“The fundamental physical as­
sumptions underlying the mathe­
matical formulations are empha­
sized as well as the limitations of 
the final results,” says Dr. Frocht.
Professor Riggs who has been a. 
member of the Carnegie faculty 
since 1922 graduated from the 
University of Missouri and receiv­
ed his master’s degree at Harvard. 
Dr. Frocht received both his bach­
elor’s and doctor’s degree in Me­
chanical Engineering at the Uni­
versity of Michigan, and has been 
at Carnegie since 1922.
A new and important feature of 
the book is found in the photolas- 
tic illustrations of stress forma­
tion and stress concentration. This 
will be the first text to embody 
such .illustrations. The book will, 
also contain an introduction to 
Photoelasticity.
CARNEGIE HONORARIES
MORTAR BOARD 
NOTE:—This is the first in a 
series of articles telling of the his­
tory, and significance of campus 
honorary groups.
Mortar Board is a national sen­
ior honorary for women. Carne­
gie was, one of the first colleges to 
have a chapter installed, and at 
present there are fifty-two chap­
ters stretching from East to West 
and from North to South. Elec­
tion to this honorary is based on 
scholarship, leadership, and per­
sonality.' At present there are 
nine members from Margaret Mor­
rison and three rrom the. College 
of Fine Arts. This number is 
based on the proportion of girls 
in the two schools. There can 
never be more than twelve girls 
in the Carnegie chapter, but there 
can be less than twelve if the re­
tiring girls do not think there 
are that many girls from the Jun­
ior class who deserve election.
The service program for this 
year includes many, things which 
have almost become traditional du­
ties for Mortar Board. One mem­
ber of the chapter is elected head 
of the women’s Actvities Point 
System; With the assistance of
the active chapter, this girl regu­
lates the number and class of ac­
tivities held by any girl on the 
campus. This system prevents any 
one girl from holding too many 
important offices. The activities- 
point chairman for this year is 
.Hazel Gough.
Mortar Board has charge of the 
printing and distribution of com­
mencement booklets, which serve as 
a program of graduation and con­
tain a list of all members of the 
graduating class. These booklets 
have already been ordered for this 
year. Dorothy Shults is the pres­
ent chairman of the committee- 
handling the work.
The use of the Women's Club 
Room, located in the gymnasium, is- 
in the bands of Mortar Board, and 
when necessary, Mortar Board re­
vises the rules for the use of this- room.
The present members and officers- 
are as follows: Margaret Seibert,
president; Dorothy Morse, vice- 
president; Mary Townsend, secre­
tary; Josephine .Wardell, treasurer; 
Alice Work, historian; Huida. 
Brierly, Hazel Gough, Gloria Ivloos, 
Marion McNary, Dorothy Shults. 
Mary Preller, and Katherine-
Wholey.
Trace Growth of Women’s Scholarship 
Organization Since Founding in 1928
There is a glamour connected 
With college life that can be at­
tributed no doubt to the social, 
athletic, and other activities which 
hold a certain position in the. pro­
gram of every institution of learn­
ing. Because of this the many 
students who spend all available 
time in earning part or the whole 
of their educational expenses are 
sometimes forgotten. At Carnegie 
about fifteen per cent of the women 
students are making this effort. 
For a number of years previous to 
192S, many women’s organizations 
011 the campus raised money for 
their own scholarships. These or­
ganizations were the Women’s 
Athletic Association, Intersorority 
Council, Household Economics 
Club, Alpha Kappa Psi, Y. W. C. A., 
Secretarial Club, Costume Eco­
nomics Club, and various clasS^ 
groups. Consequently there were 
too many appeals being made dur­
ing the college year, and also the 
same people were being called on 
to respond each time. To continue, 
however, the expression of ad­
miration for those students who 
were paying their own expenses 
and who benefited from the money 
raised by the various groups, in 
some material manner, the wom­
en’s Scholarship Organization was 
formed in 1928,
The formation of this associa­
tion simplified the numerous year­
ly appeals into a united effort to 
raise scholarships to be given each 
semester to women of the School 
of Fine Arts and Margaret Morri­
son Carnegie on the basis of abil­
ity, character and need. It has 
proven so successful that the 
newer plan has been continued.
In 1928, the Organization spon­
sored one performance of the 
Shubert musical comedy “Okay” 
given at the Alvin Theater Monday 
night, February 20. At that time 
Marjorie Snodgrass was president 
of the Organization. She was the 
one later chosen to be Campus 
Queen for 1928. As a result of the 
performance, five one hundred dol­
lar scholarships were awarded.
Helen Hayes, who has since en­
tered the movies, was presented 
the following year in “Coquette” on
the 11th of March at the same- 
theater. Margaret Wageley was 
president in 1929.
Under the leadership of Kath­
erine Anderson in 1930, the Wom­
en’s Scholarship Organization pre­
sented Carola Goya in a recital o£ 
Spanish dances—classical, modern,, 
giteno, and- fiamenca. Miss Goya 
came in an emergency created by 
the illness of Cornelia Otis Skin­
ner who had. been previously en­
gaged to appear at the Carnegie 
Music Hall. Other officers that- 
year were Louise Gilbert and. 
Agnes Harmon, vice presidents; 
Ruth Lieberman, treasurer; and 
Betty Steele, secretary.
The ’treasurer for 1930, Ruth. 
Lieberman, became president in.
1931. That year was the most suc­
cessful year of all since, for the 
first time, the goal of ten $100- 
scliolarships was reached as a re­
sult of the performance of “Michael 
and Mary” on February 23, 1931 at. 
the Alvin Theater. The scholar­
ships were awarded through the- 
executive Scholarship Committee. 
The balance of the money over 
$1,000 • was established as an en­
dowment . fund to which is to be- 
added each year all money realized 
in excess of .$1,000. The results-- 
were particularly gratifying in. 
view of the economic depression. 
The other officers for 1931 were- 
Dean Shirk and Mary Hauser, vice 
presidents; Gertrude Novak, sec­
retary; and Janet McClelland,, 
treasurer.
According to the Constitution of 
the Organization, the outgoing 
group elects the president for the- 
following year. In this way, Ruth 
Brooks, a junior in the Science De­
partment was elected president :n
1932. Supporting her were Hulda 
Brierly and Frances Timins, vice- 
presidents; Mary McKean, secre­
tary and last year’s Campus Queen; 
Margaret Seibert, treasurer. The 
members of the Scholarship Organ­
ization last year presented Angua.,- 
Enters in her “Compositions ,Vn 
Dance Form” at Carnegie Musie 
Hall February 29, 1932. This was 
her initial appearance in Pitts­
burgh.

Dr. Baker Sails for Home; 
Writes About Rise of Hitler
Procession of Nazis Shoivs Tension Due to Intense 
Nationalistic Spirit; President Von Hindenburg 
Keeps Drastic Methods of Hitler in Check
Dr. Thomas S. Baker, president 
of Carnegie, who has just com­
pleted an extensive speaking tour 
of Germany, will sail for America 
Thursday on the S.S. Hamburg.
The New York Times of Febru­
ary 5 contained a signed article 
by Dr. Baker on the ascension of 
Hitler to the chancellorship of; 
Germany and the parade of the 
Nazis in Berlin past President Von 
Hindenburg and Chancellor Hitler. 
Dr. Baker believes that Germany 
is passing through a period of in­
flation of the nationalistic spirit. 
This wave, or more correctly, 
storm of nationalism has carried 
Hitler from obscurity to the clian- 
celorsliip. He lias used drastic 
methods of stimulation, which 
have produced a feverish and per­
haps anxious spirit throughout 
Germany.
Dr. Baker does not think that 
the effects of Hitler’s rise wil be 
as detrimental to Germany as 
many observers say. He describes 
his belief partly, by the statement 
of many conservative Germans, 
“Hitler is neither a Mussolini nor 
is Hindenberg a Victor Emman­
uel.” However, according to Dr. 
Baker, President von Hindenburg 
is tired and cannot view the com­
ing of Hitler with any happiness. 
It is one more trial in his long life 
of what he has regarded as his 
duty to his country.
Dr. Baker described the parade 
of the Nazis as follows: “I watch­
ed with great interest a torchlight 
procession last Monday, in the 
evening of the day on which Hitler 
was named Chancellor. The pro­
cession itself seemed tame, as drab 
as the brown uniforms of the 
Nazis; it was supervised anxiously 
by the police; there were not 
many torches; it moved slowly, 
chiefly because of the demonstra­
tion in front of the President and 
the Chancellor.”
Hitler’s friends said the parade 
was a demonstration in his honor; 
members of the other parties said 
it was a tribute to President von 
Hindenburg. The next day the

Suggest Students 
Umpire Games
In order to simplify and speed up 
interfraternity mushball competi­
tion, a suggestion was made by the 
athletic board that student ref­
erees be used. Each participating 
team would be represented by a 
referee who will umpire one-half of 
"the contest. By using this method 
- several games can be played simul­
taneously, and dependence upon 
official referees will be eliminated.
Bernhard I. Everson, ’34, Delta 
Sigma Lambda, was elected secre­
tary to fill the vacancy caused by 
the resignation of William A. Hoff­
man, Jr., ’34, Kappa Delta Rho. 
Everson is the third person to hold 
the office of secretary to the Coun­
cil this season.
A committee composed of 
Charles E. Schatvet ’33, George O. 
Myers ’34, and William J. Burns 
was appointed to draw up second 
semester rushing regulations and 
\ to work on revisions of the other 
^existing rules.
i The Council will send drafts of 
{the revised Interfraternity Coun- 
,'cil constitution to each of the fra- 
[ternities for consideration. Any 
suggested changes or additions are 
Jto be considered by the Council at 
the next meeting. __________________

Hitler papers described the "event 
as a turning point in German his­
tory, an event that marked the 
welding together of all Germans so 
the nation could now present a 
solid, united front against the rest 
of the world. Other newspapers 
dealt with the occasion as just one 
more change in government.
Dr. Baker noticed a great differ­
ence in the reaction of Hindenburg 
and Hitler to the procession. He 
said, “The aged President received 
the ovation with friendly calm and 
dignity. Hitler showed a marked 
contrast in his attitude; lie was 
pleased; he radiated happiness; he 
had ‘arrived’ and liis joy in his 
success spoke in every gesture, in 
every facial expression.”
Of the Nazis themselves 'Dr. 
Baker wrote, “If the procession 
seemed dull and the'crowd lifeless, 
the Hitlerite troops—once the pro­
cession ended—were full o£ color 
and animation. They moved for­
ward toward their headquarters 
uninterrupted with heavy tread 
and ominous songs and cheers. As 
one watched them, one felt they 
expressed a spirit of intense na­
tionalism that could not be match­
ed in any other country of the 
world.”
Dr. Baker’s last lectures were 
given at Goettingen University on 
February 3, at Heidelberg Univer­
sity on February 7, and at the Uni­
versity of Muenchen on February 
13. The subject chosen by these 
Universities was “The Significance 
of the United States for Europe in 
the Twentieth Century.” On Feb­
ruary 1 he spoke before the Eng­
lish speaking branch of the Ger­
man Society of Engineers in Ber­
lin on “Education and Research.”
In a letter to the General Fac­
ulty, through Professor Blaisdell, 
Dr. Baker said, “I have been so 
busy working . on, and delivering 
my lectures that it has not been 
possible to write to you earlier. I 
am having many interesting expe­
riences and meeting many inter­
esting and agreeable people. I 
hope that I shall bring back to 
Pittsburgh some useful ideas.”

Council Approves 
Bridge Tourney
The Interfraternity Council last 
Saturday gave Its approval and 
sanction to the Inter fraternity 
Bridge Tournament and approved 
the schedule presented by the 
committee. The game$ are to be 
played at any time during next 
week, each fraternity being repre­
sented by two teams. Games will 
be played at the different houses, 
and each fraternity will-submit its 
high scores, which will be tabulated 
by the Council. Awards will be 
based upon this tabulation. Rules 
governing the tournament will be 
published in the next issue of the 
Tartan.
It was voted to inform the Ex­
ecutive Board of Carnegie of the 
Council’s recent action which set 
a date for a uniform “I-Iell Week” on 
the Carnegie campus. “Hell Week,” 
(more politely referred to as Ini­
tiation Week) activities will begin 
on the Monday before Easter recess 
and will terminate the Sunday 
after the resumption of school. By 
concentrating the fraternity initia­
tions to a definite period the Coun­
cil hopes that the Executive Board 
and the faculty will be more lenient 
with the students going through 
initiation.
Acting on Prof. Leo T. Lawler’s 
suggestion, the Interfraternity 
Council approved of the plan for 
Intramural debating, but tabled the 
matter until the plan Is brought 
before the various chapters. It 
was proposed that the debates con­
tinue for a period of not more than 
one month. . Each team will be 
composed of two men, but no re-

Political Inefficiency 
Decried by Dr. Ross
Continued From Pago 1
vidual to efficiently perform the 
duties of public office.
This contrasts sharply with the 
tests of good management that 
automatically eliminate the busi­
ness man, the engineer, the farmer 
or the yukon prospector from his 
line of work. In periods of severe 
competition the business man who 
is inefficient is eliminated by bank­
ruptcy. The farmer that fails in 
his management is counted out by 
the sheriff at a foreclosure sale. 
The Yukon prospector that fails to 
read the topography aright and 
chooses for a sleeping place a 
frozen stream bed that breaks 
through its ice at forty below zero 
and flows over him in the night is 
quickly eliminated from the busi­
ness of prospecting by death. 
These are a few of the flunking 
grades drawn by the inefficient in 
non-political enterprises.
In the field of democratic govern­
ment however an office holder may 
fail to acquire the right of way for 
a boulevard through private prop­
erty with the result that the road­
way is built up to the line on op­
posite sides of the property and 
lies useless for months. Although 
this is a fair test of ability, it does 
not bring automatic political death. 
Similarly errors of management 
may occur in the expenditure of 
$1,120,900 for 1,100 voting machines 
which the voters never use or in 
the extravagant purchase of fur­
nishings and supplies, but the tests 
that would have left the prospector 
a corpse and the business man a 
bankrupt leave the office holder 
hale, hearty, wealthy and wise 
enough to keep a well oiled vote- 
getting machine ready to pass his 
next election exam for him. Only 
failure to control the machine 
brings a flunking grade.
Therefore in any diagnosis of 
the symptomatic malaise of democ­
racy one must bear in mind the 
fact that the vote-getting test 
usually guages only the ability to 
organize vote getting. It is not an 
index to some very desirable quali­
ties that we.would wish to find in 
the officers of the government.
If a scientist from the strato­
sphere or from a more mundane 
Sphere were to devise a system 
that automatically combines poli­
tical death with the failure to pass 
the daily tests of efficient admin­
istration of public office and get 
his system adopted, he would be 
famous. That is to put it too 
mildly. Future mstonans might 
be tempted to dismiss the distinc­
tions between our Edisons, Ein­
steins, Capones and Walkers with 
the remark that they lived as con­
temporaries in a dark age which 
was closed by the invention of this 
political wizard.

Philadelphia Women’s Clan
The last meeting of the Carnegie 
Women’s clan of Philadelphia was 
held at the home of Evelyn Ross- 
bach at Mt. Airy, Pa., on Saturday 
afternoon, January 14, 1933.
Helen Reed Mutch, M.M. ’22, 
gave an account of her return to 
the campus for her class reunion. 
She was especially delighted with 
the fine spirit of friendliness and 
good fellowship which greeted 
alumni everywhere.
The clan plans to hold its next 
meeting at the home of Phyllis Mc- 
Marlin Fetzer, 404 Tasker street, 
Ridley Park, Pa., some time tills 
month.
Youngstown Clan
Thirty-eight guests attended the 
last meeting of the Youngstown 
Clan which was held at the home 
of Dyke Beede. A spaghetti sup­

of. the evening. Clan members are 
planning a bridge party for March 
11, Clan Day.
Clan Day
Saturday, March 11, has been set 
aside as national Clan Day for all 
Carnegie clans throughout the 
country. Programs, which include 
dances, dinners, bridges, and 
luncheons are already being plan­
ned.
Last year fourteen groups held 
celebrations. Although this num­
ber comprises more than half the 
number of clans, a one hundred per 
cent celebration Is hoped for this 
year.
Since there are two more issues 
of the Tartan before Clan Day, 
groups are urged to get their no­
tices to the Alumni Office by Fri­
day noon on February 25 and 
March 7.
The following groups have al­
ready started their plans: The
Cincinnati Clan will hold a dinner 
and card party at the Kemper

how devoted you are to your

won’t even take time off to sleep.
By the end of the week everyone 
seems to be down hearted and sad. 
No, not because of worry or fa­
tigue, but because all the joy lias 
gone out of life now that the 
exams are all over. Consequently,
liam Ball, Jr., 332S Avery lane, is

clans have already made arrange­
ments the details of which will be 
given in a later Issue. B. R. Hill 
219 Alexander street, Scotia, New 
York, is in charge of the Schenec­
tady Clan Day celebration. The 
Youngstown group is planning a 
bridge. Further details will be an­
nounced later.
There is still plenty of time for 
making arrangements. All clans 
are urged to participate in Clan 
Day.
Movies
The Alumni Office has secured 
three reels of films which deal 
with subjects about Carnegie life 
and which are available to the 
Clans. The reels include one of 
last season’s football games and 
two of new campus views. The 
movies are available for clan use 
through April and the early part 
of May. Bookings may be made 
through the Alumni Ollice.
For clans who used films lust 
year, the assurance is made that 
there will not be more than six or 
seven minutes of pictures which 
were used previously. The show­
ing takes forty minutes to one 
hour. A home-style projector is 
required for 16 m.m. films.
These films will make an excel­
lent feature for clan meetings. No 
charges are being made for the 
use of the films.
The following is the schedule for 
the showing of these films up to 
date: March 2 or 3: Akron, West

Crippled Skibos 
Face Temple in 
Boxing on Friday
Coach Ernie Sesto’s annual 
hoodoo has popped up again. In­
eligibility for the past three sea­
sons 1ms hit him harder than all 
the opposing boxers put together. 
Last year he had the classiest 155 
pounder in intercollegiate boxing 
working for him, but four days be­
fore the Syracuse match he was 
disqualified by scholastic deficien­
cies. Again this season he had as­
sembled an aggregation that looked 
like a sure conference- contender, 
but the grades have again inter­
fered. So many of the Tartan 
mittmen were Ineligible that last 
week’s scheduled meet with Pitt 
had to be postponed.
At first It was announced that 
M.essrs. Croissant, Conmuuitzis, 
Atlas, Kulas, and Restaine were all 
out. Later reports say that Com- 
muntzls and Atlas have both been 
declared eligible, which makes the 
situation somewhat brighter. Both 
these men are expected to be in 
shape for this Friday’s engage­
ment with Temple at Philadelphia.
Temple lias had a rather in-and- 
out season so far. They dropped 
an early season encounter to Pitt, 
but they stopped Duquesne, 4-3, 
recently.- Carnegie has beaten Du­
quesne by the same score, so the 
teams are evidently evenly 
matched, although ineligibility will 
undoubtedly hamper the Slvlbos1 
chances.
Communtzls will probably take 
care of the 115 pound class, and 
Atlas will box at 125. Captain 
Carr will handle the lightweight 
assignment in Ills usual satisfac­
tory manner, but the 115 pound 
class is in doubt, for Restaine is 
Ineligible and Lowrey is suffering 
L’rom injuries incurred in training. 
The 155 pound class is in doubt, 
but either Hart or O’Toole will be 
throwing punches in the 165 pound 
division. Tom Coulter, captain of 
the* track team and a capable half­
back in grid togs, is trying to 
make the weight in order to 1111 
Croissant’s shoes and his debut 
Into the fight game will be inter­
esting to watch. His spoed and 
rangy build should prove quite a 
disadvantage to opposing marks­
men.
Carnegie is not the only school 
having difficulty in getting a team 
together, for W. & J. is also hav­
ing its troubles. They have boon

Magic has its place... but not in ciga­
rette advertising.
Consider the illusion that there is 
a mysterious way to give cigarettes a 
superior “flavor.”
RLES—B—yDHBO Cigarette flavor can be 
controlled by adding artificial flavor­
ings. By blending. And by the quality 
of tobaccos used.
Cheap, raw tobaccos can be “built 
up” or “fortified” by the lavish use 
of artificial flavorings.
Ciüill
Such magic, however, seldom holds 
the audience. Your taste finally tells 
you the truth.
The cigarette flavor that never stales, 
never varies, never loses its fresh ap­
peal, comes from mild, ripe, fragrant, 
more expensive tobaccos., .blended to 
bring out the full, round flavor of each 
type of leaf. It’s the quality of the to­
bacco that counts!
Mgr- At is a fact, well known by 
Uleaf tobacco experts, that 
Camels are made from finer,
MORE EXPENNAVE tobaccos than 
any other popular brand.
Because Camel actually pays millions 
more every year for choice tobaccos, 
you find in Camels an appealing mild­
ness, a better flavor.
And Camels taste cooler because 
the welded Humidor Pack of three- 
ply, MOISTURE-PROOF cellophane 
keeps them fresh.

Plaid Floormen Meet 
New York, Temple and 
Penn State This Week
Violets Hope lo Avenge 
Last Year’s Defeat 
Wednesday Night
THE 32-28 VICTORY SCORED OVER THE GEORGETOWN cagcrs 
Saturday night gave the Tartanc undisputed posscsoion of second place 
In the Eastern Intcrcollcgiatc conference, a position that they have 
chared with Temple for the past two weeks. Although the scorc 
would indicate a closer game, the Plaid five were never begging and 
hold the upper hand throughout. At times during the contest the 
Hannumites showed flashes of form and power which we have failed 
to see In them so far this year, and If they should keep up the good 
work they are going to bad news for some of the future opponents.
The offense clicked in great fashion in the first few minutes when 
an 11-3 lead was gained, and again before the first half was over when, 
after the score had been tied, the Skibos put on the steam and raised 
it to 26-13 at the half. But the one trouble seemed to be that as soor. 
as a few points lead were gained, the Tartans would fall back into 
mediocre playing.
The Smith, Fergus, Jagnow combination clicked nicely in the first 
half. The passing and cutting of this trio was responsible for most 
of the points in the first half. Bobby Smith broke loose in this perioc 
to gain nino points. Despite tho fact that big Ed Stentz was con 
tinually at odds with the referee, he was in there fighting and played 
well under the basket.
Hargaden, Georgetown's guard and high scorer of the evening, 
was as good a player as has been seen in these parts this year. He 
was exceptionally clever In handling the ball and his accuracy at the 
basket can be attested by the fact that he scored 12 points.

SEEN AT THE GAME. A miniature mass meeting which had all of
the appearance» of. being a coaches' convention. Max Hannuin, Doi 
Carlson, Pitt mentor; John Irvin, former Tartan coach, and Lester 
Biederman, Press reporter. Max was keeping up his reputation us 
chief gum eiiewer of the Pittsburgh coaches. His jaws were working 
like a locomotive and his attention seemed to be divided between Dr. 
Carlson and the game which was about to go on. And the good doctoi 
was talking as usual—about the referees. At the side we found two 
of the school’s notalble professional men. Said Surgeon Munhall to 
Doctor Marks: "How’s business?” And before I could get the an­
swer they drew off into a corner and conversed in hushed tones. 
During the whole time Semicolon Stewart was walking back and forth 
sporting a new black and white scarf. Then in came the great Tom

On Wednesday tho boys land In Gotham and meet the violet of New

twelve of the strongest teams In the district. An award will be made 
to the aqund showing the best sportsmanship in the tournament. I 
would far rather have the Sklbos win that award than win their game 
by thirty points. To me good sportsmanship Is more to be desired than 
ulmply the winning of the game.
On Friday night, the city of “Brotherly Love" and tho home of 
the Temple Owlu lu the destination. The Owls have been victorious 
In their last nine games and have not suffered a defeat since the one 
handed to them by the Tartans here In Pittsburgh. Temple had, with 
tho exoeptlon of Duquonne, what I thought, was the bcBt team that had 
appeared bore against the Sklbos, and with a game In the conference 
at stake and a clean reoord on their home floor as an Incentive, It is 
going to be one tough game to win. On Saturday night the Plaid team 
heads west nnd north up to the heart of Center county and the home 
of tho Nltany Lions. Penn State has one of Its best team In recent 
years and they have boon winning with great regularity. To defeat the 
Lions on their homo court especially after tho long trip and the two 
prooodlng tough games Is going to bo a pretty tough Job. No doubt 
tho team will bo backed by somo student support for Penn Stato Is a

THE VARSITY SWIMMERS PLUNGED INTO THIS WATER AND 
DEFEAT for tho lirst time tills year on Friday night when they came 
out at the low end of a <11-18 score against Pitt. The Panthers had 
it pretty much their own way with the exception of tho ilfty and one 
liundrod-yard dashes, and tho one hundred and lil’ty-yard back stroke. 
Pal Miller came in lirst in the two dashes and Ranny Boyer came out 
in front in the back stroke, much to tho grief of Pat Corr. Despite 
Pitt’s sound victory, Pat Corr, the Panther coach, seemed dissatisfied 
(the poor little fellow) and growled around for most of the evening. 
But if you want to get his goat just happen to mention the meets with 
Harvard and Yale.
Friday and Saturday afternoons the team will have a splashing 
good time in their meets with Case and Western Reserve. The Plaid 
outfit has a good chance of repeating their last year's performance in 
which victories were scored over both of the teams. However, re­
ports that have come out of the Buckeye State bring with them the 
information that both teams are materially stronger than they were a 
year ago; so Captain Franlce and his boys may have their work cut 
out for them.

THE GREEK CUP SNATCHERS are at it stronger than ever now that

to adorn their mantels. At the present time the Delts and the Alpha 
Sigma Phis are on top of the American League with the Pi Kappa 
Alpha's ready to topple them at any moment. The Betas hold un­
disputed possession of the top in the Federal League, and despite the 
loss of Clisbee to the varsity they seem all set to win tnelr bracket. 
In the National League the Kappa Sig’s'and the Theta Xi’s are battling

without a defeat. Scobell Hall and Mr. Soyring are out to administer

WE COULD NOT LET THIS ISSUE PASS without making some men­
tion of the death of James J. Corbett, former heavyweight champion 
of the world who died in his home on Saturday night. Corbett who 
came into fame by Ills knockout of John L. Sullivan in 1892, is a man 
who will never be forgotten In the sport world. It was “Gentleman 
Jim” who did a great deal to bring boxing out of the rut of low repute 
in which it had been at that time, and make it a game which is ac­
cepted in most every country of the world. Corbett brought about a 
great change in the boxing game. He made it into a game of skill In­
stead of nothing more than a brawl dominated by brute strength and 
questionable tactics. He was the first of the great boxers. His whole 
life was a model for anyone at the present day. He was a good sports­
man and he led a clean life. That is how he earned his name as 
“Gentleman Jim.” He never fought in a fixed fight, and to prevent 
such a thing he always required a fairly large man to man bet on 
the outcome.
So to you Jim, a man who had the courage of your convictions to 
be a good sportsman, to live a clean and upright life, and to be a gen­
tleman; we pay our tribute. >' ,

Hoyas, W & J

The Tartan basketeers begin 
their annual swing through the 
East on Wednesday when an old 
sports nemesis, New York U., will 
,.ry to keep up the bad work al­
ready in vogue against Carnegie in 
football. Last year Carnegie in­
vaded the Gotham city and sound- 
y trounced a highly favored Violet 
basketball outfit ho this season 
Coach Hannum must return pre­
pared to receive the "works" as 
New York teams don’t easily ac- 
piire losing habits.
Skibos Meet Temple U. Friday 
After a,day of respite the Skibos 
drop down into Philadelphia for a 
/ery important conference game 
with Temple. The Owls have 
won four and lost two conference 
ijames which leaves them virtually 
Lied with Carnegie for second 
place, so the City of Brotherly 
Love may reflect the light of battle 
for a little while Friday night if 
previous Tartan-Owl contests are 
my indication. Carnegie defeated 
Temple in their first encounter 
jariler in the season, but partisans 
.vho witnessed that torrid overtime 
struggle which either team might 
just as well have won, will find lit- 
:.le solace for the Tartans In the 
result of that contest.
Temple, after dropping games to 
Pitt and Carnegie, broke into the 
winning column by taking double- 
headers from both West Virginia 
and Georgetown and, having once 
gotten a. taste of victory, may 
prove difficult to stop. The leading 
Conference scorer Rosan, is a 
member of the Owl squad and 
will be remembered by the fans for 
his fine work in the first Tartan- 
Temple struggle.
Tartans Last to Defeat Owls 
In addition to the defeat handed 
them earlier this year, Temple 
dropped both ends of a home-and- 
home arrangement to the Sldbo 
last season and consequently are 
about duo to put one over on Iian- 
num's Helpers. Tho basketball 
game on Friday will lie preceded 
by a Conference boxing match but 
as tho old P Q business didn’t 
leave much for the Owl pugilists to 
twlng at, tho Sklbo boxers may bo 
forced to suffer their first defeat. 
On this same evening Pitt meets 
Georgetown in Washington in an­
other Conference basketball en­
gagement.
Tho Tartan trip terminates Sat­
urday night at Mt. Nittany when 
Penn Stole plays host to Carnegie’s 
floormen, For the last t hree years 
the Skibos have made things a lit­
tle too tough for State and have 
Iways como out ahead. Saturday’s 
contest, unless a lot of dope Is up­
set, should also go to Carnegie 
although the Lions are somewhat 
of an unknown caliber this season. 
Last Friday, however, Templo ex­
perienced little difficulty in over­
coming State.
Points Scored by Tartans
Jim Fergus, Tartan Co-Captain
Watch Stops and Half 
Goes to 35 Minutes 
In Proxy Game
Faulty timing devices seem to 
be playing quite a roll in Carnegie 
court records this season. At 
Notro Dame a couple of weeks 
ago, the gun . failed to go off, and 
the Irish left the floor with an ill- 
deserved victory; last week the 
clock stopped down at W. & J., 
and the second half went to no 
less than thirty-five minutes, but 
the Tartans only took this oppor­
tunity to widen their already large 
margin of victory. In short, the 
Prexies took the short end of a 
long game, 55-36.
The game was somewhat of a 
repetition of an earlier game be­
tween "the two teams in Pittsburgh 
a month or so earlier. The Tar­
tans easily outclassed their oppon 
ents in every department of the 
game except foul-shooting, and the 
Skibo shock troops were more than 
a match for anything the red and 
black could put on the floor. 
Lieber, sensational W. & J. for­
ward, was again completely bottled 
up by Mr. Fergus and his col­
leagues. Bobby Smith, as usual, 
was the high scorer for the even­
ing, but Edelblut and Fergus were 
also responsible for a goodly crop 
of counters on the score sheet.
Last Saturday the Skibos brought 
their percentage up to an even 
.500 for the season by shading 
Georgetown 32-28. The game in- 
cidenlly strengthened Carnegie 
Tech’s grip on second place, in the 
Eastern Intercollegiate Confer­
ence. Pitt continues to hold down 
the top rung in the ladder.
In the Georgetown game, Max 
Hannum’s men started fast and 
piled up a 11-3 lead, before the 
Hoyas could get started. The lads 
from Washington _ came back 
strong, however, and knotted the 
count at 11-11 and again at 13-all. 
Carnegie again stepped away at 
this point and left the floor at tho 
half with the score 23-16. The sec­
ond half was slow and for the most 
part very uninteresting. The 
Skibos got an early basket, and 
then for seventeen straight min­
utes they failed to score from the 
floor. Georgetown pulled up with­
in two points of the Tartans at onr 
point, 26-24, hut two baskets an« 
two fouls quickly put the game on 
ice. Hargaden, star guard for the 
Hoyas, was high point man for tho 
evening with twelve points, while 
Smith and Jagnow each garnered 
nino for Carnegie.

Set Pace With Unblemished Records
With the Intramural Basketball 
season half completed we find the 
leaders showing their class and a 
few dark horses riding high also. 
The Betas were almost humbled by 
Boss Hall as the score was rather 
close at the half. The only other 
exciting battle of the week was be­
tween the Alpha Slgs and the Pi 
Iv. A’s. It was anybody’s game un­
til the closing minutes when the 
Alpha Sigs slipped a few in to give 
them a victory.
The championship battle goes on 
with two good teams in each 
league setting the pace. In the 
American League it looks to be a 
battle between the Delts and the 
Alpha Sigs. The Delts have not 
encountered any real tough oppo­
sition yet. The National League 
seems to be between the Kappa 
Sigs and the T. X's. In the Fed­
eral League It's the Betas and Mc- 
ir ? Gill -Hall who are leading and it’s 
\ pretty even so far

Plaid Natators’ 
Loss Gives Pitt 
Lead for Title
'Tlie Carnegie Tech Swimming 
Team engage in their second and 
third meets of the season this 
week-end when they encounter the 
merrimen from Western Reserve 
on Friday and Case on Saturday in 
tlie Tartan Pool.
The Tartans in their first meet 
with Pitt on Friday were defeated 
by -11-18 by the strong Pitt Panth­
ers, but despite this loss they set 
out. to even up the percentage 
column by copping off both meets. 
Both Western Reserve and Case 
have strong teams as can be 
shown by their record this year 
and Coach Risedorph’s team will 
have to use every bit of their 
ability to come out as victors in 
the engagements.
Last year in a trip out into Ohio, 
the Scots captured the scalps of 
both of these two teams and they 
are anxious to make It a clean 
sweep over each for the second 
year in a row. The Tartans have 
lost but two men from last year’s 
team but these . two were sure 
point getters and they are hard to 
place. However, Miller, who won

To Meet Two 
Strong Teams
Case And W. Reserve To 
Be Meet Friday 
And Saturday
The crack swimming team of 
the University of Pittsburgh won 
its eighth consecutive victory in 
the Eastern Intercollegiate Swim­
ming Association last Friday even­
ing when it trimmed the Carnegie 
Tech swimmers at 41-18 in the 
Trees pool.
Four records were broken as 
the Panthers gained their decisive 
victory over the Tartans. Sclnneil- 
of Pitt, broke his own record 
of 2:41 2-0 in the 200-yard breast­
stroke by cutting the water for that 
distance in 2:3S 3-0. In the 160- 
yard relay the Pitt boys broke the 
previous mark of 1:16 by taking 
the distance in 1:15 3-10. Of the 
three first places taken by Carne­
gie Tech, two were record-breaking 
swims. Miller, in the 100-yard free­
style, cut the mark for the Trees 
pool to :55 3-10, and Boyer exe­
cuted the 150-yard back stroke in 
1:40 1-10. Miller also negotiated 
a first in the 40-yard free-style.
The defeat of Carnegie Tech put 
Pitt into first place for tlie associa­
tion title.

The co-eds at Duke University 
are getting a reputation for heavy 
eating. From September to the 
Christmas holidays they devoured 
7,3S3 pounds of chicken and tur­
key.
One more word about exams. If 
you flunked, maybe it’s your own 
fault. Recently fifty students at 
Vallepin, Spain, locked two profes­
sors iii. a room until they promised 
to pass the whole class without 
any exam. But that was Spain.
the fifty and the one hundred yard 
dashes against Pitt should be a 
sure winner in these two meets. 
Boyer, who on Friday broke the 
Trees pool record in the back­
stroke against Pitt and who holds 
the Carnegie record in the same 
event expects little difficulty in 
coming in first against either op­
ponent.
The foreign language depart­
ment at Emory University will in­

the summer session.
Registration Figures 
Show Small Decrease
Continued From Pago 1 
a total of 18 enrolled in classes as 
follows: senior, 16; and special, 2.
Although the figures for this 
semester’s total registration are 
somewhat below that of last semes­
ter’s registration, figures are not 
as yet complete and no final com­
parison can be drawn. As the 
figures stand now, the change over 
last semester and a comparable 
period last year show a decrease 
well under 10 per cent.
Students who have been unable 
to register on time are expected by 
the Registrar’s Office to swell the 
total registration figures to such an 
extent that a smaller decrease will 
probably be shown.
Carnegie Tech is expected this 
year to act as host to all college 
rifle teams in Pennsylvania, Ohio 
and West Virginia when they 
gather for the annual shoot-off of 
the National Intercollegiate Cham­
pionship. Officials of the National 
Rifle Association in Washington,- 
D. C., have stated that they are 
agreeable to having the matches at 
Carnegie. Final acceptance is ex­
pected by the end of the weelc.
The National Intercollegiate 
Championship match is scheduled 
to be fired on Inarch 25, on which 
day all college and university 
teams in the country will gather 
at one of a dozen schools to com­
pete. An official from Washington, 
present at. each school where the 
matches are fired, will send the 
targets to the N. R. A. where they 
will be scored and the national 
champion announced. Carnegie 
will thus be one of these schools 
and will have teams from the fol­
lowing schools competing with the 
local team: University of Penn­
sylvania, Drexei Institute, Dayton 
University, University of Cincin­
nati, University of West Virginia, 
Fenn College and University of 
Pittsburgh. Each of these colleges 
will send a five-man team, several 
alternates, coaches and managers. 
The total number will probably ex­
ceed eighty men present at the 
meet.
Much attention will be centered 
upon the local section of the na­
tion-wide shoot in that last year’s 
national championship team, from 
the University of Cincinnati will be 
here as will be Dayton who placed 
fifth and Carnegie who took sev­
enth place.
The Skibo team leaves Thursday 
morning for Annapolis to shoot an 
invitational match on Saturday 
against the midshipman team of 
the Naval Academy. The Middy 
team is perhaps the strongest in 
the east, and is a most formidaUie 
opponent. Last year the Tartan 
marksmen suffered defeat at their 
hands, but succeeded in turning in 
the highest score of any Navy op- i 
ponent. This year finds Tech' 
minus such men as Beckert and 
Scherba who were the backbone of 
last year’s strong team. Coach 
Sommer will rely upon Captain 
Painter, Buse, Irons, and Dickson 
to make up a team which will be 
equal to the strength of the Navy 
aggregation.

A Light Beam
TALKS
FROM the flickering light of a neon tube on the skyline of New 
“ York City, a speech was sent to the S. S. President Hoover, 3000 
feet away. The small neon tube changed the electric impulses 
from a microphone into light waves, which were directed to the 
ship in a narrow beam. A photoelectric tube in the center of a 
receiving mirror on the ship changed the light impulses back into 
sound, and the speech was heard on board.
The use of light that can be heard, and of sound that can be seen, 
has many applications. It can be used for speech communication; 
it can serve in fog to guide aircraft on their course and into port; 
and it can be used for radio and television broadcasting.
The development of future forms of transmission, whether in 
sound or light waves, will largely be the responsibility of 
college-trained General Electric engineers. To-day, these men 
are planning, producing, and testing electric equipment which 
will help to maintain General Electric’s leadership in its field.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN. TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 21. 19335
Well, I see. that we are going to 
have a holiday this week. Suppose 
some of my cohorts will say that 
this announcement won’t make any 
difference to me, since I am always 
idle, but nevertheless I always ap­
preciate a holiday too. Although I 
am idle, a holiday is a welcomed 
event in my life, just as it is in the 
lives of others. So, a word to the 
wise, don’t come out Wednesday 
evening to go to school, because 
there won’t be any.
Of course you can come out to 
the campus and find something do­
ing, however, since I notice that 
the Night Student Council has 
scheduled a dance to be held on the 
twenty-second of this month, Wash­
ington’s birthday. All night stu­
dents know what that means. A 
big dance and when I say big, I 
mean it. I have attended other af­
fairs and know what they are like. 
You don’t have to wonder if this 
will be right, or if that will be so, 
everything is arranged for you and 
all you do is come and enjoy your­
self. Am I going to be there, well, 
just you come out and see.
Guess the Arts Ball is history 
now, and what a history it promises 
to be. A trip to the planet Mars 
must be an eventful happening in 
one’s college life. These episodes 
come every two years and in the 
interim a great deal of energy is 
stored up for coming event. From 
the way those people worked dur­
ing the past week, the party must 
'have been one big time. I intend­
ed to go, but at the last minute I. 
failed to qualify as ah art student 
so, “nix” was the reply to all my 
applications. They said I could go 
to the Post-Arts Ball, but who 
wants to be a pos.t-man? If I can’t 
be a fore-man I won’t play.
Speaking of balls and dances, I 
noticed that Didja Notice said 
that the Night Arts gave a dance 
for the industries and engineering 
students. How funny that reads to 
me. I was unable to get to the af- 
• fair so- can’t say just how many of 
my fellow workmen of industries 
and engineering were out. Notice 
I didn’t say fellow art students, 
since I am Idle and only the other 
group's are idle; far be it from me 
to call the arts idle.
Glad to note that the engineers 
are to hold the banquet this year. 
The party is scheduled to be held a 
little later this year than usual, 
but I suppose it will be none the 
worse because of the postpone­
ment. This affair is always a big 
time and T .am looking forward to 
the eleventh of March when I can 
put on the soup to fish “a la ban­
quette” you know. It is sorta good 
to get out once a year with the 
high brows of the hotels and show 
that we do know how to engineer 
our etiquette through a full course 
dinner. A technical course does 
sorta make one lopsided and an op­
portunity to get out once in a while 
is good. So, all together,-let’s turn 
out for the banquet. Don’t know 
what the per capita will be for the 
plate but I am sure that, with the 
repression making an impression 
on the pocketbook, the result 
should be a material reduction on 
the exchequer. I’ll be looking fox- 
more details in the Tartan, and you 
do likewise for the same reason.
Tempus Fuglt, or something like 
that must have moved the powers 
who bo to install a brand new 
clock in the foyer of the Adminis­
tration Hall. It sure is a beauti­
ful piece of technoc—I almost said 
it, I was thinking of Telecron. 
There you are, that technocracy 
has made an imprint on my Eng­
lish. I wonder how long the effect is 
going to last. However, the chron­
ometer is a welcomed addition and, 
placed as it is over the air views 
of the campus, it makes a very ap­
propriate setting. So Tempu^ 
Fugit—don’t be late for classes.
I managed to get my copy of the 
Puppet this time. Had some tall 
scurrying to meet up with a night 
salesman who hadn’t sold out and 
thus the day was saved. They must 
have gone like hot cakes. The 
number was real good and much 
enjoyed. Keep it up—True Luv.
Noticed that there are some night 
stndents who are not getting their 
Tartan. How.sad that must be for 
them not to be able to get all the 
campus news. Here I am writing 
week out and week .in and then to 
think that some of my fellow stu­
dents are not fellow readers. 
Wrong again. It all goes to show 
that half of the campus does not 
know what the other half is read­
ing. But then, we can't be blamed 
If the one half does not let the 
other half know that they are not 
getting the paper. It will all come 
out In the wash I am sure, now 
that we know how to proceed. I 
suppose the handbook does tell 
what to do in cases like that.
Who threw the macaroni in Mag­
gie Murphy’s pie? That was a 
mean trick to do. And you know 
how girls dislike worms. Why, 
they would rim a mile and scream 
at the appearance of one o£ those 
earth-inhabitating things. Think 
of it, a ground worm, an earthworm 
being thrown at a Betty Co-ed. It 
was a lowbrow trick to inflict on a 
poor, unsuspecting college girl es­
pecially after she had been dis­
secting them through a class in 
"dietics” or some such course 
which they have at M. M. Speak­
ing of early birds, it’s about time 
ior me to be signing off or else I’ll 
get the worm too. So, so long un­
til—ihat was the Idle Night Stu­
dent signing off until this time next 
week. The Tartan bids you all 
good nig’Jit.

Survey Shows 
Advantages of 
College Training
An article in the March issue of 
"Chemical and Metallurgical En­
gineering” that represents the re­
sults of >a long investigation of 
what happens to graduates holds 
some interesting information. The 
article sets forth the data collect­
ed at the Massachusetts Institute, 
of Technology during the last ten 
or fifteen years, and traces the 
graduates of one of the courses 
through their business careers.
One thousand graduates of the 
course, which is similar to the 
Commercial Engineering course of­
fered at Carnegie, were sent ques­
tionnaires and eight hundred and 
fifty responded. The assemblage 
of the data, and the conclusion 
drawn, are set forth in an interest­
ing manner, and lead to some sur­
prising conclusions.
The one thousand men ques­
tioned were not hand-picked, but 
taken at random, being the first 
thousand that graduated after the 
study was begun. The records of 
these men are surprisingly good, 
exceptionally so, in fact, and fur­
nish quite an advertisement for 
their college. The percentage of 
graduates in executive positions is 
Very high, indeed, they were ex­
ceptionally so, and it would be sur; 
prising if there were not a stam­
pede of engineers to commercial 
engineering and business adminis­
tration courses.
Boxing Hazards 
Not Appreciated 
By Sport Goers
The death of a prominent prize 
fighter from injuries received in a 
recent fight serves to remind us 
that all matches are not the “stand- 
ups” that many believe them to 
be. The general public, always 
ready to feel and declare them­
selves cheated, usually regard 
many of the championship and up­
per class fights as being under­
taken by the fighters merely as a 
means oi making a living. They 
fail to realize that many of these 
men take their calling just as seri­
ously as 1 an. artist, engineer, or 
other professional man.
It is true that the prize ring, like 
all other sports, has been commer­
cialized to a very great degree, 
also that some of the contests 
leave much room for discussion of 
the outcome. However, taken as 
a whole, the average fighter is just 
as desirous of winning his contest 
as any other human is to succeed 
in his line of endeavor.
The unfortunate outcome of this 
recent contest will silence a great 
deal of the public’s criticism which 
had centered on the contest in 
which the catastropliy occurred. 
A fighter may figure for a knockout 
for monetary gain, but there is no 
record of any financial advantages, 
in being killed. It is to be hoped that 
the unfortunate accident will not 
be repeated, although the possibili­
ties of fatal injuries are always 
present in contests of this kind.
Home Loan Bank 
Proves Failure
Last spring, Congress set up a 
new banking system, The Home 
Loan Bank, to provide loans for 
farmers and small home owners, 
and the whole county welcomed it 
as the long looked-for relief to dis­
tressed debtors. The newspapers 
were filled with articles telling the 
blessings of this act henceforth, 
no family would have to lose its 
farm or home by a mortgage fore­
closure. Obstacles in the way of 
securing loans or extensions were 
to be removed, and interest rates 
were to be lowered.
There was an unfortunate little 
four-line provision in the bill which 
said that home owners could se­
cure loans “direct.” This was con­
strued by the people to mean just 
what it said. Some over-sanguine 
ones assumed that they could ap­
ply “direct” to the Treasury and 
secure funds to use as they pleased.
As a matter of fact, few loans, if 
any, will be made '“direct,” and in 
any case, loans will be made only 
according to law which limits them 
to 30 or 40 per cent of present ap­
praised value. The management 
declared that the Home Loan sys­
tem is not just a plan to give re­
lief in the present emergency, but 
one to provide a permanent method 
of finanacing home loans.
Building and Loan Associations, 
Saving Banks, Insurance Compan­
ies, etc., will have to join the plan, 
but there is so much rigamarole to 
it that general disgust is being felt. 
The bankers and loan people are 
really opposed to the plan, for it 
looks as though the government is 
going into the loan business in co­
petition with them.
Evidently, it is going to a long 
time before the Home Loan Bank 
gets to functioning, and those who 
have counted on it to bring them 
prompt relief will have to forget it. 
No advances are to be made except 
upon “sound financial principles.” 
This means that the conditions 
which a debter will have to face 
are practically the same as ever.
Night Engineers 
Banquet Plans 
Are Progressing
Plans for the annual banquet 
to be held by the Night College of 
Engineering are progressing rap­
idly and from all indications this 
affair will be one of the finest ever 
held by that college. This year 
marks the eighteenth time that this 
banquet has been held since the 
tradition was started and it has 
been so firmly established that 
many foraier stuuents are always 
present at the affair and become 
acquainted with the new students.
The banquet hall 6i the Roose­
velt Hotel has been engaged for the 
affair. This same hall was the 
scene of a very successful banquet 
several years ago and the new 
management of the hotel have 
promised to make this one more 
outstanding than the last one.
Plans for the entertainment are 
not entirely completed but there 
is no doubt that when the final ar­
rangements are made Ibliat they 
will be of an unusual nature.
Tickets are now on sale among 
the students of the college and 
may be purchased for $1.00 per 
plate.
Former Students 
Keep Up Studies 
In “Y” Classes
The “depression college” of the 
Y. M. C. A. is coming at a great 
rate, and some of our brothers in 
arms at Carnegie in recent years 
are enrolled in the courses offered 
there. These men,' being unable to 
find the wherewithal to pay for 
another year at Carnegie exemplify 
the spirit of the-true night student 
by carrying on their work at the 
“depression college.” The work 
taken will aid them materially in 
their future studies here for they 
will come back to the fold as soon 
as they can find' jobs which will 
place them in the earning ranks 
again.
Interviews with some of these 
students indicate that the “college” 
is being taken very seriously by 
these unemployed people and sev­
eral of them claim that they work 
harder there than they did at Car­
negie. (They must never have 
taken a Math, course here.) They 
claim that it provides them with 
something to do to help get their 
minds off the depression, and they 
throw themselves into their studies 
in an effort to forget their forries.
At any raitie it is good to see 
these men. making an honest effort 
to continue their studies instead of 
grumbling at their inability to at­
tend here, and we who were for­
tunate enough to come back to Car­
negie this year should wish them 
all the luck in the world.
Prohibition Doom 
Appears Certain
Well, well! the old soaks are at 
it again, and this time it looks like 
the drys are going to get a run for 
their money. Believe it or not, 
after all these years, prohibition 
seems to be on its way out, and 
the people will have a chance to 
decide for themselves whether or 
not liquor will come back.
It is safe to assume that if liquor 
is legalized it will be kept under 
very strict control, both as a 
pacific gesture towards the drys, 
and to provide means for collecting 
a deficit reducing revenue. This 
method will at least keep part of 
the citizens sober enough to walk 
until they become acclimated.
All indications are that drinking 
will decrease on a per capita basis, 
although the volume of liquor con­
sumed will probably increase great­
ly. One can assume that the drink- 
. ing habit will be like many other 
things. Make it legal, and you take 
all the fun out of it. At any rate, 
we hope that the much advertised 
social ills attendant to legal booze 
will not develop. There is no rea­
son why they should.
The question sheet for a recent 
BroWn University examination was 
headed as follows: “Write legibly
and neatly. The corrector cannot 
interpret your scratches nor fly 
specks, nor' has he time to devote 
to cross-word puzzles when pre- 
sented on examination books.”
Washington’s Birthday Dance 
Eagerly Awaited by Stndents
Selection of Will Ryshanek’s NBC Orchestra is 
Dular; Committee to Assist Chairman for 
Remainder of Season is Chosen
Popi
Since the announcement last 
week that Will Ryshanek’s NBC 
Orchestra lias been selected to 
play for the Washington's Birth­
day Dance this Wednesday even­
ing. a great deal of interest in the 
affair has been aroused. Every­
body knows that the music will 
be of the best and that together 
with the attendant amospliere 
given the gymnasium on that event­
ful night will mean one thing only, 
the most enjoyable evening one 
could possibly imagine.
Plans for the decorations of the 
gymnasium all center around a 
huge revolving crystal ball to be 
hung in the middle of the audito­
rium. Unique lighting effects will 
further add to the transformation 
of the immense men’s gymnasium 
into a gorgeous ball room, re­
splendent with color, where care­
free happiness will reign supreme 
that night.
A committee has been selected 
by the Night Student Council to 
assist the social chairman and to 
serve for the balance of the school 
year. The members of this com­
mittee are: W. E. Faix, G. C.
Garliart, A. C. Grimm, S. J. Nik- 
hazy, R. F. Fischer, L. J. Becker, 
R. E. Panton, H. B. Stone, J. 
Thomas, W. A. Watson, C. E. 
Blochinger, M. Wingert, O. Mulig, 
P. Stevens, P. J. Sparrow, E. C. 
McMullen. These students have 
been very active at social functions 
in the past and are greatly respon­
sible for the success of the social 
activities sponsored by the council 
this year.
Tickets for the dance may be se­
cured from any of the student 
salesmen on the campus, and ¡f 
these have not been obtained, they 
may be purchased at the door the 
night of the affair. Better plan to 
be out to enjoy the gayest party of 
the season. Remember Wednes­
day evening in the . Men’s Gymna­
sium and Will Ryslianek and Ills 
NBC orchestra furnishing the 
music.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT the big dance of the 
season Is to take place Wednes­
day night. I'll be seenya there.
THAT the arts school looked 
like a mad house last week dur­
ing the preparations which 
were under way for the Arts 
Ball.
THAT the Industries school 
boasts a brand new electric 
clock, so that the boys can be 
on time for classes hereafter, 
we suppose.
THAT this mild season seems 
to agree with everybody much 
more so than the arctic weather 
we were getting.
THAT the well known lady 
from Arts school is sporting 
some jewelry; a present from 
one of her admirers. Wonder 
If they have smoked the pipe of 
peace over there?
THAT an industries boy and 
girl seem to be that way about 
each other, and was his face 
red the other night when some­
body kidded him about it?
THAT the Baron has nothing 
on some of those boys who 
gather In the office from time to 
time.
THAT the night school frater­
nities crashed the news last 
week. Played the same game 
on different groups at the same 
time.
THAT the arts boys and girls 
play a rough game called “you 
tear my shirt and I’ll tear your 
dress,” and do they get noisy 
about it?
THAT that famous saying, 
"Here, put this in the corner,” 
was revived last week, but is 
destined for a quick death 
mates since part of our gang 
have been deprived of the cup 
that cheers.
THAT that’s that and I’ll be 
seenya.

MEMBER FEDERAL 
RESERVE SYSTEM
Cause and Cure 
For Depression 
Is Still Sought
It is now a matter of speculation 
as to what will be offered as the 
next cure for the depression since 
the technocrats seem to be de­
throned. The sad economic condi­
tions have stimulated much 
thought on causes, effect and pos­
sible methods of relief, but unfor­
tunately none of these ideas have 
been worth much.
Too many people are lead astray 
by projected reforms. Especially 
when the reform calls for a com­
plete overthrow of some existing 
order. It would seem that most 
people blame the "system” under 
which we live. Be that as it may, 
no one seems to have a clear con­
ception of just what the "system” 
is.
It is safe to say that any cure 
offered which calls for a com’plete 
turnover of the existing order of 
things is of doubtful value. Usual­
ly, while some (Of the projects have 
been lead by sincere men, the 
whole plan is only a grandstand 
play.
It does not take intelligence to 
dream of a new order of things, nor 
does it require cleverness to fill a 
gap in a dream with another brain 
wave, but it does require intelli­
gence and resourcefulness of the 
highest order to take the things 
that we have .and make something 
out of them.
The so much talked of American 
sobriety and steadiness seems to 
be sadly lacking, in the present 
crisis. This is at least true among 
the ruling classes. Perhaps, from 
the common people, a leader will 
come yfho will have the good of 
the people at heart, and who will 
have more respect for the citizens 
individually than for the feelings 
of foreigners with whom our lead­
ers deal, treating the citizens col­
lectively__________________________.
Students Warned 
To Discourage 
Campus Begging
There have been several in­
stances recently of promiscuous 
bogging on the campus. While the 
practice is forbidden' by colloge 
regulations, it was quite notice­
able that the mendicants were do­
ing a fair business. The most 
noticeable incident was that of two 
little girls, about fifteen and ten 
years of age respectively, appar­
ently sisters, who invaded the En­
gineering Hall.
Although the engineers are all 
accused of having Scotch ancestors 
and are a notoriously impecunioiib 
group, the little girls got a big 
hand, and collected a tidy sum in 
the short interval in which they 
operated. The watchman, not ap­
preciating the story he was wreck­
ing, and not being of a philan­
thropic turn of mind, ejected them 
gently but firmly, as the saying 
goes.
No doubt, if this official hadn't 
been tipped off and there had re­
mained five minutes more for the 
actors to act, there wouldn’t have 
been any trick at all in getting an­
other paragraph for your weekly 
scream. But, that’s the way it 
goes, when something does happen 
in Engineering Hall, there is a 
rule against it, and it would not 
make lit reading for the law abid­
ing element which constitutes the 
night student body (ahem!).
Be that as it may, it might be a 
good idea to refrain from donating 
to anyone soliciting aid unolllcial- 
ly on the campus, for, if the word 
gets out that we are inclined to be 
philanthropic, the engineers will 
all be late for class from now on. 
You sec, it will require some time 
to remove their disguises and 
pocket their gains, and get to class. 
Engineers must live.
Seriously, however, giving to 
these individuals may only aggra­
vate and extend the practice, YH 
let us refrain from exposing our 
big-heartedness, at least while on 
the campus.
The International Press has dis­
covered that more than 75 per cent 
of the students at the University 
of Washington cannot name all of 
the -1S states in the United States 
in 10 minutes.
This was' proved in a test given 
students and faculty at the uni­
versity. 'Phe faculty did not come 
out much better.
Some of the "States” which the 
undergraduates named to 1111 out 
their 'IS were Southern California, 
New Orleans, Omaha, and the Dis­
trict of Columbia.
Ceramic Industry 
Shows Progress
The meeting of the American 
Ceramic Society in Pittsburgh 
last week resulted in many public 
displays of work showing applica­
tions of ceramics to industry and 
art. Looking at these exhibitions, 
one was impressed by the rapid 
strides made in quality improve­
ment and general excellency of 
product.
Artistic applications have al­
ways been far ahead of the more 
practical uses of ceramics, if not 
in volume, at least in matters of 
knowledge concerning the best 
way to produce beautiful effect 
Now that manufacturers have be­
gun to realize the increased sales 
appeal brought about by a pleasing 
color scheme, research along prac­
tical lines to enable production 
methods to be applied to artistic 
uses has advanced rapidly.
The future of the entire creamic 
industry will continue to improve 
chiefly because of 'the determined 
aggressive development of new 
uses for their wares, and new mar­
ket by the producers.
Jig-Saw Puzzle 
Craze Defended
The jig-saw puzzle craze, like 
the old cross-word puzzle mania, 
has taken hold and seems to be 
with us to stay. True, many 
,neophites have already deserted 
the cause, but there are many of 
the steadier die hards who are lay­
ing plans and getting practice for 
the day when they can afford to 
search for the puzzle of puzzles, a 
five foot square with a thousand 
and one pieces.
While hot terribly educational, 
the fad does develop one’s appre­
ciation of color, size, and shape, 
and in this way sharpens the mind 
to a bettor appreciation of detail. 
If the puzzler realizes the value of 
the acumen of mind, and applies it 
to his or her everyday life, some 
material good may result. In any 
event, it is a bettor way to spend 
an evening than to sit in a dark 
corner and feel sorry for one’s self.
Exams! Exams! Collegiate pub­
lications aro full of talk of them. 
One senior at Massachusetts State, 
the story goes, was so surprised 
upon finding his name among 
those exempted from tlio final 
exams that, ho photographed the 
list, to show Ills parents.__________
Employment of 
Fellow Students 
Plan is Urged
With many of our fellow students 
unemployed, it might be a good 
Idea to try to apply a "Buy Car­
negie” plan. Many of us have 
work to offer around our homes 
and places of business, and, un­
thinkingly let the contract go to 
almost any workman at all. There • 
are a number of students very 
much in need of work, and such 
jobs as general repairing and the 
like would bo welcomed.
No matter how small the job, or 
how little time it would take to 
have it done, why not inquire 
around your classes and see if you 
cannot find a classmate who is 
able and willing to do the work. 
In this way, pulling together, wo 
may be able to do some real good 
for our less fortunate mates who 
have received harder treatment 
from the depression than we have.
Students Should 
Prepare Now for 
Future Changes
Semesters usually suggest new 
starts, but with the Industries stu­
dents there is no letup between 
the last week of the first semester 
and the first two weeks so far. 
Let’s hope those grade envelopes 
contained encouraging notes. Stick 
to it fellow students and, remember 
tests are regularly scheduled dur­
ing the second semester too.
Look ahead .and prepare your­
selves. A recent popular magar 
zine article prophesies for the 1040 
foreman. “No industrial develop­
ments now in sight will take away 
anything from the responsbility oE 
the foreman for effective produc­
tion in the shop. On the contrary, 
those responsibilities are likely to 
incroase while at1 the same time., 
the foreman will need a continually 
greater stock of general and spe- 
cillc knowledge. For the require­
ments of 1!)3G or 1910, the foreman 
of 1932, unless hi the meantime he 
has broadened his knowledge and 
kept in step with Improved pro­
cesses, will bo as. unsuited as the 
nineteenth-century doctor in ’ a 
modern hospital.”
This logic can bo applied to all 
positions In every Industry. That's 
encouraging.: Just think how well 
off wo’ll bo, that is, If wo continuo 
our studies, opportunities will find 
ua prepared._________________________

I’d never thought much about what’s inside a 
Chesterfield cigarette. But I have just hcen reading 
something that made me think about it.
Just think of this, some of the tobacco in Chest­
erfield—the Turkish—comes from 4000 miles away! 
And before it is shipped every single leaf is packed 
by hand. All becausc Turkish tobacco is so small 
and delicate.
Of course I don’t know much about making

milder and have a very pleasing aroma and taste. 
They satisfy—and that’s what counts with me!

Revive The All Honorary Dance
The gesture on the part of four engineering honorarios to 
co-operate in sponsoring a combined engineering honoraries 
dinner dance tonight brings to mind the all-honorary boat ride 
held for a number of years by the campus honoraries. For the 
past several years slowly widening chasms have been growing 
between some of the honorary groups. This tendency can be 
attributed mostly to petty jealousies and misunderstandings 
which are held by one or two members within the different 
groups. There is no excuse for such conditions to exist and the 
steps taken by the members of the engineering honoraries to 
become better acquainted is an indication that something need 
be done to bring the honoraries closer together.
It lias been suggested that an inter-honorary council be 
formed to promote co-operation between the various societies, 
this council to function similarly to the Interfraternity Council. 
.While the Tartan takes no stand on the advisability of such a 
council, it docs recognize that something could well be done to 
promote better understanding and co-operation among the 
members of the various groups. An inter-honorary dance, such 
as the engineering honoraries’ dance tonight, or some other so­
cial event would lie a possible, and highly desirable, solution.
The small differences existing between several of the 
groups arc-slight,, but these'.differences may continue to groAv 
and when the sentiment is handed down from year to year the 
facts usually become highly colored. Exaggerated as this may 
seem, honoraries fail to fulfill their original purpose when petty 
differences based on irrelevant factors do arise. If these differ^, 
'cnees arise because of conflicting functions, the functions 
should be re-doiined or some of the honoraries should be 
eliminated.
In order to inform the students about the purposes, func­
tions, and membership requirements of the various campus hon­
orarios, a series of articles will be run in the Tartan, starting 
with this issue, which will explain in detail facts about the dif­
ferent organizations.
Some sort of an all-honoraries function which would 
bring together the members of the various honorarios would 
undoubtedly awaken the sleepy groups into activity—a needed 
stimulant in several cases. Some interested group should peti­
tion Student Council to consider reviving the all-honoraries 
¦fiance.
A Most Liberal Action
The action taken by the Executive Board last Saturday 
which will permit degree graduates to register for day courses 
without payment of tuition fees is one of the most unusual ac­
tions taken by the Board for some time. The fact that this 
action is taken at a time when the Board has already gone to 
the limit to financially aid undergraduate students makes it all 
the more unusual. The very liberal attitude taken by the 
Board in all matters concerning the students’ and graduates’ 
welfare is remarkable.
This liberal action gives the unemployed graduate an op­
portunity: to continue-his school work and to-employ his idle 
time with stimulating study and constructive thought. One of 
the worst effects of the depression is its devastating effect upon 
the minds of college graduates who are filled with ambitions 
but are unable to secure work.
The unemployed graduates will certainly welcome this 
Action.
Intramural Debating
The Interfraternity Council’s favorable reaction to the sug­
gestion of Prof. Leo T. Lawler of the Department of English 
that debating be added to intramural competition is an indica­
tion that this non-athletie activity will probably take its place 
with the newly organized interfraternity bridge tournament, 
which will begin next week, as another form of competition. 
Although the matter of the actual formation of a league lias 
not been considered by the Council, the members seem enthus­
iastic about the plans as offered by Professor Lawler. This 
further indicates that there is a possibility for the formation of 
a varsity debating team, the ultimate goal of Professor Law­
ler’s plan.
Debating as an activity is probably one of the most valua­
ble activities in which students can participate because of the 
training it gives one to think quickly and to express opinions 
clearly and convincingly. There is a great need for this type 
of extra-qjjrricular activity on the campus.
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
It is not often that we find in 
the etymology of a single word tho 
epitomized explanation of what 
man has set up as his conception 
of the origin of nature, the physic­
al world and associated planets, 
and life—especially in those as­
pects of things external for which 
naitural causes, as discovered by 
science, have been found inade­
quate. However, "inspiration” is 
such a word. It means "the infus­
ing into as if by breathing; the 
affecting as with a superior or su­
pernatural influence.” This mean­
ing follows reasonably enough from 
the derivatives of the word: "in” 
and "spiraref,” which express 
‘‘breathing into.” This source is 
reminiscent of the biblical state­
ment that the Creator breathed His 
spirit into man after the latter 
had been suitably fashioned from 
the materials at hand. Seemingly, 
'then, life came from an external 
source. Furthermore, the word 
has come to express associated 
thoughts or notions'. Any phe­
nomenon that remains inexplica­
ble in a natural way is clarified by 
resorting to a supernatural explan­
ation, is based upon some "breath­
ed in” principle.
This conception of things natu­
ral has come down to us through 
the ages of man and is recorded ex­
tensively in race history. It ap­
peared in the pagan belief that the 
various forms of nature contained 
gods or spirits; there existed a 
god of the sea, of the earth, of the 
sun, and so on. It appeared in the 
authoritative pronouncements of 
the prophets, such as commands 
that were heaven «ent. In this lat­
ter form it survives among Chris­
tian fundamentalists as the basis 
for the authenticity of the Bible. 
Its origin and continuance seem 
natural enough in view of human 
limitations and incapabilities in 
lifting the veil that obscures so 
much of what we try to see into 
around lis.
What the future meaning and use 
of this word will be cannot now be 
forecast. The limits of its proba­
ble course have not been accurate­
ly set. Perhaps the illuminations 
and radiations of science will be­
come sufficiently clear to elucidate 
for man¡..all nature in a natural 
way. Perhaps1 the doubt, obscur­
ity, and confusion existing among 
scientists will become resolved, 
plain, and ordered enough so that 
man may see with his ordinary 
faculties—not through a glass 
darkly. In the. midst, however, of 
grave uncertainty and insecurity 
of mind, many still remain satis­
fied with the belief in the explana­
tion of the natural through the su­
pernatural. And the word “inspira­
tion” retains its original mean­
ing.
Women’s Scholarship 
Organization Grows
RADIO PERSONALITIES—
It seems that the Puppet staff couldn’t get to­
gether on when that swell all-Carnegie trio goes 
on the air from KDKA. Pledge work sessions 
cease every' Saturday morning at a certain fra­
ternity up on Forbes street while House Manager 
Goodridge gathers his flock around the radio to 
listen in, and so if you’re still in doubt you know 
whom to ask. The "Sorority Sisters,” Reba Wag­
ner, Evelyn Gamble and Frances Weaver, ac­
companied by 
Alice Lob- 
augh, are the 
ones. They 
have received their full 
share of fan 
mail, so we 
learn, along 
with numer­
ous telephone
calls. When they made their debut the station 
received over fifty telephone calls before the girls 
were out of the studio. I wonder how we know?
This trio is not Carnegie’s only contribution to 
the ether waves. Basketball Co-Captaiii Bobby 
Smith went on the air last Saturday when the 
team played Western Reserve. Speaking on a 
sports chat program 'over a Cleveland station, 
Bob scored a great hit when he pulled the fol­
lowing: “I find that it’s never safe to predict the 
outcome of a game until it’s over.” Pie’s telling 
us.*****
ABOUT THE CAMPUS—
Rumors are floating about that the “Golden 
Gloves” have been removed, lightening the load 
of a certain trophy laden watch chain. We can’t 
vouch for this because the wearer has not been 
seen around lately.
Sandy McClean has all the little girls up in 
the air. Imagine anyone claiming he writes all 
the gossips columns in the Puppet. Don’t be fool­
ish, Sandy. We know who does.
Speaking of the Puppet, did you notice that 
Bill and Bobby, editor and principal right hand 
man, respectively, skipped off for the sunny 
South just before the last issue burst forth upon 
the campus?
Another Florida-between- semester-vacationist 
was "Shoits” Croissant of the Skibo mitt team. 
The boy has a way of getting around in his own 
peculiar way.*****
NOT FAR FROM THE CAMPUS—
Last Saturday night was held the largest, 
finest, and best pig roast in recent Carnegie his­
tory. Some twenty-two Carnegie students all 
told participated. The singing of Carnegie songs 
with orchestral accompaniment was the featured 
entertainment of the evening. If you ever want 
to see a pair that can really get hot on the drums 
get .Tack Hiltz and Joe Lentz to work out for you 
some time.
Those Carnegie co-eds will get to the Pitt 
dances. Gobs and gobs of them at the Pitt Ju­
nior Prom, to say nothing of Bill Reed and LeRoy 
Gibson. This dance afforded a little laugh when 
a fraternity pledge from one of the Pitt houses 
put in an appearance garbed in a Williams base­
ball suit over his regular street clothes and car­
rying an umbrella. Stating that he was an en­
tertainer, he sought to gain admission as per in­
structions, the doorman inquired and found the 
poor frosh was an uninvited guest, and, as a re­
sult, was forced to turn him away. Someone who 
had observed the whole doings from a distance • 
came over and inquired from the doorman what 
it was all about. Imagine, he received the fol­
lowing reply: “Aw just some Dramat from
Tech.”*****

But for the familiar outlines of Engineering Hall, Machinery Hall, 
Carnegie Institute, and Forbes Hall we might not recognize this scene 
as the Cut in 1916. During the war Carnegie was the military training 
center for the Pittsburgh district and the campus was crowded with 
buildings no longer standing. The houses in the foreground are army 
barracks, built almost over night to house the scores of men who came 
to Carnegie to train for overseas duty.

THE SURROUNDING WORLD
By JOE ADAMS
EDGEWORTH NMOKANG TOBACCO
The wets finally coasted through 
yesterday and the House voted to 
repeal the dry law, passing the 
Blaine repeal resolution which 
was passed by the Senate last 
week with a 289 to 121 vote. This 
action will send the prohibition 
issue back to the States for rati­
fication or rejection.
The drastic “gag” rules com­
pletely throttled the fight by the 
drys to delay the vote. Speaker 
Garner continually cut the speech­
es of dry leaders by announcing 
that their time had expired.
When the vote of the house was 
announced the galleries burst into 
applause, quite against usual 
house rules. The demonstration 
lasted several minutes.
Speaker Garner forced the House 
to vote on outright repeal. Al- 
tliought he failed to win a majority 
when the House voted the first 
time he succeeded in his second at­
tempt.
Republicans and Democrats for­
got party lines and joined hands to 
pass the resolution by a margin of 
15 2-3 votes. These triumphant wets 
are anxious to have an early rati­
fication.
The Pacifists and Militarists in 
the colleges are at it again. It 
seems as though student opinion 
in a great many colleges where 
military training is compulsory is 
against the R. 0. T. C., claiming 
that it encourages war and arma­
ment. A manifestation of this at­
titude has come to a head at the 
University of Maryland. Since the 
college is of land grant origin, na­
tional laws compel the teaching of 
military science to undergraduate 
males in the school.
Two students, one freshman and 
one sophomore, refused to take 
part in the military training 
course. The one claimed that it 
was contrary to his religious faith 
and the other that it hurt his con­
science. Both students were sus­
pended from the college by its 
president. Needless to say, the 
cases were brought up before the 
courts. The student who claimed 
that military training was con­
trary to the belief of his church 
was reinstated because he was able 
to show that the charter of the 
school obliges it to accept students 
without requiring or enforcing any 
religious, or civil test.
The national law does not re­
quire the training to be compul­
sory; it merely says that training 
must be provided. Many schools 
do, however, make it a rule that 
all male undergraduates take some 
military training. This rule is in 
effect at the University of Mary­
land.
Other colleges have also been 
havmg trouble with students who 
are objecting to compulsory mili­
tary training. This may be a man­
ifestation of the growing anti-war 
feeling among the younger citizens 
or else a protest against being 
forced to take courses without be­
ing consulted. Let us hope that it 
is the former.
Pacts are madfc, treaties are 
signed, and orders are given; yet 
Japan continues to march further 
into China. China, once swept by 
civil war, now unites to light off a 
common enemy. Japan’s defiant 
attitude, contrary to international 
opinions, seems to indicate that 
Japan may force herself into a 
most undesirable position. The 
more Chinese land Japan takes, 
the less anxious she seems to be 
to arbitrate. Perhaps when she 
has had her fill, to date an unde­
termined quantity, nipy come to 
earth and make some sort of 
peace agreement.
First France defaulted on the 
war debts and now old, honest 
England gives us little hope of an 
arrangement being made for the 
next payment. Britain’s Chancelor 
of the Exchequer, Neville Cham­
berlain. says that it is highly im­
probable that some sort of conces­
sion arrangement can be made, 
since the Ottawa agreements tie 
England’s hand. Each statement 
issued by foreign governments 
seems to make debt negotiations 
more impossible.
Just what can be done is hard to 
say. If the debts are cancelled, 
we become an international joke 
and have only a second mortgage 
on a war that is over in exchange 
for all our good American dollars. 
To collect we would need force 
and that would cost more money, 
and even after we" used force, if 
we were successful In our venture, 
where would Europe get the money 
from? You answer it, I can’t.
Now that-the first five-year plan 
has been over for some time and 
many of the sceptical remarks 
made by outsiders forgotten, the 
Soviet government has started to 
boast of its achievements under 
that plan. They tell how the pro­
duction of pig iron, machinery, and 
other items have beten increased 
and forget about all of the waste 
and poverty on existing all sides.
They talk about plans for im­
proving the living conditions of 
their • people, since they can not 
point out actual improvements. 
They tell how wages have gone up 
but forget that prices have also 
gone up in Russia. Thus,- the 
latest report issued by the Soviet 
government is one-sided, hence 
valueless from the standpoint giv­
ing the reader an insight into 
actual conditions.
Recently, I talked to a young 
Russian who is studying in this 
country and who is a believer in 
the Soviet plan. When I attempt­
ed to question him on the subject 
of the five-year plan he remained 
silent. However, after quite a long 
talk, I was able to discover that 
the Soviet government considers 
the entire project as one great fac­
tory. He claims that they let only 
outsiders see the. parts - of -the 
country they think advisable be­
cause many of their schemes are 
being treated as industrial secrets 
which they do not w^it revealed. 
When I suggested that the govern­
ment might want to prevent out­
siders from visiting Russia because 
they wanted to hide *thelr inoili- 
clency, he was too excited to speak.
.... IT'S TIME TO 
Telephoie Home!
IGHT-THIRTY P. M. is the time to telephone 
home!
The day’s rush is over; the night’s, still young. .There’s 
plenty of time for a newsy, intimate chat. The fam­
ily’s at home, eager to hear your voice. (They’ll be 
there for sure if you telephone as a regular habit, the 
same time each week.)
What is more, it is cheapest to telephone after 8:30 
P. M. That is when the low Night Rates go into effect 
on Station to Station calls. For 45c you can then call 
as far as 140 miles away!
Yes, it’s surprisingly inexpensive, as these typical 
rates show. But he sure you make a Station to Station 
call. Just give your home telephone number to the 
operator and hold the line. If you like, the charges 
can be reversed.
