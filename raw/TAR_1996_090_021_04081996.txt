Police modify alcohol citation policy
By TREVOR MEYEROWITZ
Voluom euo990l,uIl
“We are one of the few, or maybe the 
only school in Pennsylvania that doesn’t 
issue state citations [regularly for alco­
hol-related violations],” said Director of 
Security James LaPaglia. This will 
change as of May 1, when CMU Campus 
Police will stop issuing internal cita­
tions for alcohol-related violations and 
begin issuing state citations.
“The main reason [for the change] is 
that we feel our students need to be held 
at the same standards as everyone else 
in the Commonwealth [of Pennsylva­
nia],” LaPaglia said. “We have to be 
responsive to the standards of the com­
munity. ... It certainly is more consistent 
with what the state does for Campus 
Police to be issuing state citations in­
stead of internal citations. It will have 
more of an impact that we’re showing 
this Commonwealth that we’re enforc­
ing the liquor laws on this campus.”
There are also other reasons for imple­
menting the citation change. “The big­
gest safety and security issue facing our 
campus is alcohol and alcohol-related 
behavior,” LaPaglia said. “Every year I 
meet with the commander of the Penn­
sylvania state police for the western 
portion of Pennsylvania, and we [Cam­
pus Police] have an agreement with them
that if the Commonwealth is satisfied, 
the likelihood of the Liquor Control En­
forcement coming on our campus is small. 
We want to keep Campus Police patrol­
ling and not have to have state or city 
policé come onto campus.”
Carnegie Mellon’s alcohol policy is 
based on Pennsylvania’s state laws, but 
most alcohol-related citations have been 
internal. “Up until now [Campus Po­
lice] have had the option of issuing ei­
ther internal or state ¿itations for of­
fenses. involving alcohol. Our officers 
have had the ability to. issue state cita­
tions, and on a few occasions we have 
done that,” LaPaglia said.
“[Campus Police] have used internal 
citations for a little over eight years. 
They were initiated when I first came to 
the University.... At that time the atti­
tude for enforcement was different,” 
LaPaglia said. “[Since then], Campus 
Police have developed from security to 
law enforcement, and that has made a 
major impact in our department. The 
enforcement of state law regarding alco­
hol is just part of Campus Police’s ex­
pansion of capabilities.”
When a state citation is given, an 
internal violation must still be filed. 
“We have had a duplicate process for 
dealing with violations of state law when 
it comes to alcohol violations, and it just 
makes more sense that we would avoid
any unnecessary duplication of the pro­
cess,” LaPaglia said.
Both types of citations result in fines 
of about $50. The main difference is that 
a state citation can result in suspension 
of the offender’s driver’s license. The 
penalty for first-time underage drink­
ing is a 90-day suspension. A second 
time offense carries a one-year removal 
of driving privileges, and the result of a 
third offense is a two-year suspension.
Contrary to the concern of many stu­
dents, a state citation for a summary 
offense alcohol violation does not include 
a criminal record, according to LaPaglia.
Many of the students interviewed were 
angry about the new policy. “That’s ter­
rible. It’s taking something that could be 
taken care of very easily and making a 
big deal of it. It would be getting fairly 
good kids in trouble for no reason at all,” 
said Katie Pittman, a sophomore ECE 
major.
Some students said that they think 
alcohol violations should continue to be 
handled as they are now. “I think that 
they should continue handling it inter­
nally, unless it becomes a problem with 
the individual, then they can go outside. 
After they handle the need internally, 
then they should decide whether or not to 
take it outside,” said Alexandra Hector, a 
senior Chemistry major.

Case builds against Unabomber suspect
HELENA, Mont, April 5 (AP) 
— A manual typewriter found 
in Theodore J. Kaczynski’s 
shack appears to be the one the 
Unabomber used to type his 
letters andhis grandmanifesto 
about the evils of technology, a 
federal official said Friday.
That apparent link between 
Kaczynski and the master­
mind of the 18-year bombing 
spree came as federal agents 
spent a third day searching 
the tiny cabin and an out­
building in the wilderness 
near Lincoln.
Kaczynski, 53, was charged 
Thursday with possessing 
bomb components found in his 
cabin.
The former Berkeley math 
professor was held without 
bail in a Helena jail under a 
suicide watch and decided Fri­
day he did not want a prelimi­
nary hearing or a bail hear­
ing.
Michael Donahoe, Ka­
czynski’s court-appointed law­
yer, said his client will wait for 
the federal grand jury to con­
vene April 17 and decide 
whether to indict him.
The charge filed Thursday 
made no mention of attacks 
by the Unabomber, who has 
killed three people and in­
jured 23 in nine states; the 
charge is intended simply to 
keep Kaczynski in custody 
while investigators build their 
case.
Kaczynski could get the 
death penalty if convicted 
under federal law of sending 
a mail bomb that kills.
Two manual typewriters 
were taken from Kaczynski’s 
cabin and were being analyzed 
at FBI headquarters in Wash­
ington.
“lit looks like the manifesto 
and the letters from the 
Unabomber were typed on one 
°f them,” according to the of­
ficial in Washington, who 
spoke on condition of anonym­
ity. “We’ll know for sure after 
the detailed lab analysis.”
The Unabomber’s 35,000- 
word manifesto and letters to 
newspapers “were all typed on 
the same machine,” the offi­
cial said. “We believe he did 
that intentionally as a way for 
us to know the communica­
tions were authentic.”
Experts can trace a document 
to a specific typewriter by 
studying minute variations in 
the positioning and shapes of 
letters, which change over time 
as typewriters wear.
Kaczynski was taken into 
custody Wednesday as fed­
eral agents searched his cabin 
50 miles northwest of Hel­
ena. They staked out the 
cabin for several weeks after 
Kaczynski’s mother and 
brother pointed authorities 
to him when they found old 
writings they believed were 
similar to the Unabomber’s 
manifesto.
Federal agents already have 
found a bomb workshop in the 
cabin, including a partially as­
sembled pipe bomb, chemicals 
and 10 three-ring notebooks 
filled with meticulous notes 
and sketches of explosives and 
electrical circuitry.
Kaczynski has been coop­
erative with jailers and 
spends much of his time pac­
ing in his cell, O’Reilly said. 
He is kept apart from other 
inmates and is eating his 
meals, the sheriff said.
Kaczynski graduated from 
Harvard when he was barely 
20 and received a master’s 
degree and doctorate from the 
University of Michigan sev­
eral years later. Academic- 
oriented and obsessed with 
technology, he fits the FBI 
psychological profile of the 
suspect.
He was a math professor at 
the University of California at 
Berkeley from 1967 to 1969, 
then quit and lived in Utah, 
doing odd jobs and menial la­
bor. The Montana cabin has 
been his home for about a dozen 
years.

CMU anticipates Campus Z-Station program
By GEL ALTEROVTTZ
Voluom eIm,1l euo990l,uIl
Carnegie Mellon has been cho­
sen to be a participant in the 
Campus Z-Station program, a 
joint-effort between Zenith Data 
Systems and Microsoft to encour­
age students to buy Windows 
based PCs on campus. The pro­
gram provides a cus­
tomized solution for 
the needs of college 
students by lowering 
costs for universities 
providing support for 
students connecting 
into the campus network.
Carnegie Mellon was one of just 
two universities, the other being 
the University of Michigan' 
picked for the pilot program which 
is expected to Ipegin this month.
Gene Lambert of Zenith Data 
Systems (ZDS) described the cur­
rent state of the proposal. “We 
are in the process of goingthrough 
a memorandum of understand­
ing with the University, but upon 
completion of that, you will see
College Z-stations show up on 
campus.”
“Our target was to have sys­
tems in the store by April 15, 
1996,” Lambert said. “We may 
miss that a little bit; but there 
is no doubt that we will have 
equipment available May 1 at 
the campus reseller [the CMU 
Computer Store].
Microsoft and ZDS on the pro­
gram. We wanted to get some 
feedback on what types of pro­
grams were needed in higher edu­
cation, or needs that were not 
being filled.
“The need of students, faculty, 
and staff to connect into the cam­
pus network is really increasing 
at a phenomenal rate,” Lambert
Microsoft
“PCs, unlike Apple products, 
are being bought off campus,” said 
Lambert. “We want to bring that 
business back to the campus.” 
The program’s launch, officially 
announced March’25, follows a 
year of research into the needs of 
higher education, according to 
Lambert. “One of the primary 
reasons for Carnegie Mellon’s 
involvement is that it actually 
started very early in the research 
portion that was being done by
said. “It’s a critical need of the 
school to get you connected, but 
there are some inherent high costs 
involved as far as providing sup­
port [and] providing an easy 
mechanism to get that connectiv­
ity achieved.”
George Norris of Microsoft said, 
“We started with what with we 
felt was a very savvy school from 
the public sector ... the Univer­
sity of Michigan, and a school 
that had a good handle on the
implementation of technology 
from the private perspective, and 
that was Carnegie Mellon.... 
Those are the first schools that 
we started working with, two 
schools that were very much in­
volved in the overall design and 
research on the project.”
Zenith and Microsoft hope to 
make the program available to 
other higher education 
institutions in the 
coming academic year.
The program’s goal 
is to aid students by 
providing complete 
computer hardware 
and software bundles at a dis­
counted price and to reduce uni­
versity costs in providing sup­
port to students trying to connect 
into the campus network. In a 
joint press release from Zenith 
and Microsoft, Alex Hills, vice 
provost and chief information of­
ficer at CMU, said, “We are inter­
ested in this program because we 
want to remove barriers for stu­
dents, who should be able to set

Radar blanks again 
at Pitt Int’l airport
PITTSBURGH, April 5 (AP) — You 
can’t set your clocks by the radar fail­
ures at Pittsburgh International Air­
port yet.
The screens went blank for four 
minutes Thursday, the eleventh time 
the radar has either flickered or gone 
completely black in the last six months 
at the nation’s 13th-largest airport, 
said Dale Gourley, president of the 
National Air Traffic Controllers 
Association’s Pittsburgh union.
The Federal Aviation Administration 
said the radar was out for two minutes 
around 2:20 p.m.
FAA officials said the radar blacked 
out just as workers were installing a 
$500,000 system that is supposed to 
prevent such outages when it comes 
on line in May.
The FAA said “no air traffic inci­
dents resulted” from the outage.
Gary Bishop, Allegheny County’s 
aviation director, said controllers im­
mediately began delaying flights to 
compensate for the loss of radar. 
Nearly all flight schedules were back 
to normal early Thursday evening, 
he said.
On Wednesday, Federal Aviation Ad­
ministration officials said they would 
install a number of backup systems at 
the radar and control towers.
This includes the $500,000 elec­
tricity unit that acts like a house­
hold surge protector for the radar. It 
is supposed to provide battery power 
as a cushion until a generator can be 
fired up.
Installation should ensure round- 
the-clock power without interruption, 
FAA officials said.
Only four of the FAA’s 400 control 
towers, including the one at Los An­
geles International Airport, have the 
equipment that the Pittsburgh air­
port is getting. About 110 FAA towers 
have ASR-9 radar systems.
New CD-Rom brings bible stories to cyberspace
April 5(AP)—He made Moses come 
alive in “The Ten Commandments.” 
He was the inspiring figure of John 
the Baptist in “The Greatest Story 
Ever Told.”
Now the performer most associated 
with biblical movie epics is taking his 
act into cyberspace with “Charlton 
Heston’s Voyage Through the Bible.” 
While archaeologists sift through 
rubble for clues to biblical history and 
scholars debate the finer points of bibli­
cal translations and sources, Heston 
said he is just tryingto bringthe biblical 
texts to life in the way he knows best.
“Nobody ever hears the story,” 
Heston said. “I’m telling the story.” 
The two-CD-ROM series from Jones 
Digital Century Inc. ofEnglewood, Colo., 
provides some 100 hours of biblical in­
formation and entertainment. The core 
consists of Heston telling many of the 
most moving and powerful biblical sto­
ries.
But the multimedia CD-ROMs also 
offer the opportunity to read the texts of 
the Book of Moses and the Gospels; 
view more than 200 art masterpieces; 
listen to music from Mozart, Bach and 
others; and take a virtual reality tour 
through 3-D animated models of bibli­
cal sites.
The CD-ROMs — one for the Old 
Testament and one for the New Testa­
ment — are $29.95 each.
Although he has played biblical 
heroes in only “The Ten Command­
ments” and “The Greatest Story 
Ever Told,” those two films, which 
have retained their popularity by 
touching religious roots in viewers, 
have indelibly identified the actor 
with biblical roles.
The CD-ROM project is based on 
the 1992 miniseries “Charlton Heston 
Presents the Bible,” shown on the 
Arts and Entertainment Network. 
Heston said the new version not only 
allows viewers to browse through the 
multimedia presentation of great art­
work and music, but gives him the 
time to tell more stories from the 
Bible.
The actor, who identifies his reli­
gious background as Christian, makes 
clear what his role is. And it is not one 
of an evangelist, he says.
“I have been very careful and in­
deed adamant in pointing out my 
presentation of this is as an actor,” he 
said. “I’m an actor. I tell stories.”
But reading and performing the 
biblical stories still allows him to 
make a special contribution, Heston 
said.
“As a matter of fact, they never tell 
the stories in churches, synagogues, 
and mosques,” Heston said.
He said there is more of a tendency 
to read a single verse or passage and 
base sermons on just those parts.
“I’m functioning as a storyteller,” 
Heston said. “It’s too bad it isn’t done 
oftener.”
U.S. mourns 
crash victims
WASHINGTON, April 4 (AP)—Presi­
dent Clinton ordered flags lowered to 
half-staff and led a memorial service for 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown 
and 34 other Americans killed in a mili­
tary plane crash a day earlier in Croatia.
The president began Thursday with 
an early-morning telephone call to 
Brown’s wife, Alma, confirming that 
the secretary’s body had been identi­
fied on a rain-swept hilltop near the 
airport in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Much 
of the rest of the day was devoted to 
the task of calling families of other 
victims.
Clinton and his wife, Hillary, wiped 
away tears at a noontime prayer ser­
vice with Cabinet members and offi­
cials of the Commerce Department 
and White House at St. John’s Episco­
pal Church.
Clinton paid tribute not only to Brown 
but also his colleagues in the Commerce 
Department, the military, and the busi­
ness community who perished.
“As we grieve for them we should 
thank God for their lives. And that there 
are still people like them willing to an­
swer the challenge.”
The U.S. State Department released 
the manifest of the ill-fated plane 
showing that 11 Commerce Depart­
ment officials died with Brown, along 
with a CIA analyst, a Treasury De­
partment executive, 12 corporate lead­
ers, a reporter, six crew members, and 
a foreign interpreter and photogra­
pher.
The Pentagon defended the relatively 
old technology that was used to guide 
the plane toward the airport in 
Dubrovnik in a violent storm on Wednes­
day.
“It is a kind of an approach that’s been 
around for a while ... but it’s still a very 
valid approach,” Air Force Lt. Gen. 
Howell Estes, III said.
The U.S. Air Force and the National 
Transportation Safety Board dis­
patched a team to Dubrovnik to inves­
tigate the crash.
“The president will be very interested 
in the answers that are developed by 
the accident board,” said White House 
Press Secretary Mike McCurry. “He’s 
had a number of questions, as all of us 
have questions, of how something like 
this could happen.”
PSU professor 
shoots for stars
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. April 05 (AP)
— A Penn State professor who studies 
how the nervous system regulates blood 
flow has been chosen as a finalist for a 
mission aboard the space shuttle Co­
lumbia in March 1998.
Dr. James Pawelczyk, 35, will learn 
within a year if he will be one of two 
payload specialists aboard the Neurolab
mission, which will focus on neuro­
science research. He was one of four 
candidates announced Thursday.
The overall mission is sponsored by 
the space agency and the National In­
stitute of Health.
Pawelczyk’s research is of particular 
interest to NASA because many astro­
nauts have suffered from irregular blood 
pressure after returning from a flight. 
Some have suffered from bouts of dizzi­
ness for several hours after returning to 
earth.
Other studies on the 16-day mission 
will focus on how microgravity affects 
sleep, the respiratory system, nervous 
system development, motor behavior 
and balance.
He said that the two scientists who 
will join the crew of five astronauts will 
perform experiments on behalf of about 
two-dozen researchers.
Pawelczyk, an assistant professor of 
applied physiology, joined the Penn 
State faculty in August. If chosen, he 
will be the first Penn State faculty mem­
ber to fly on a shuttle mission.
Pitt examines 
romantic links
PITTSBURGH, April 3 (AP) — Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh teachers who 
find themselves romantically involved 
with a student may soon have to re­
move themselves from overseeing that 
student.
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg will 
review a policy establishing that rule 
after it is examined by lower adminis­
trators. If he 
approves it, it 
could be imp­
lemented as 
soon as next 
month for full 
and associate 
professors, as 
well as re­
searchers and 
graduate and undergraduate assis­
tants appointed to instruct.
Teachers who did not remove them­
selves from positions of authority rela­
tive to students they dated could be 
disciplined.
Ken Service, a Pitt spokesman, said 
he did not know what the penalties 
would be.
“Relationships of an intimate na­
ture compromise the integrity of a 
faculty-student relationship wherever 
the faculty member has a professional 
responsibility for the student,” the 
policy states.
“Transgressions of this policy not only 
violate professional ethics but also ren­
der both the university and the faculty 
member vulnerable to civil charges of 
sexual harassment,” it says.
The policy was first proposed two 
months after an employee in the 
university’s advancement office sued 
the school. She said she was fired 
after she was dating her supervisor.
Police mistake 
toy gun for rifle
BARRINGTON, R.I., April 4 (AP) — 
The husband of a former gubernatorial 
candidate was briefly detained by police 
who mistook a rubber-band gun he was 
carrying for an assault rifle.
Warren police issued an all-points bul- ¡ 
letin after several citizens reported see- ' 
ing Theodore Leonard, 65, the husband 
of 1992 Republican gubernatorial nomi­
nee Elizabeth Leonard, carrying a black 
gun.
Leonard was spotted walking across , 
the border into Barrington along county 
road by a Warren police officer, who \ 
withdrew his gun and ordered Leonard 
to set the gun down, Barrington Police 
Sgt. Richard Mclnnis said.
Mclnnis said Leonard was hesitant 
but eventually placed the gun on the 
ground and stepped back. He was then 
ordered to his knees and handcuffed.
‘Police discovered that the gun was a : 
fake, so Leonard was not charged, but 
they said it was easy to mistake for a i‘ 
real rifle.
“It’s black, manufactured of a com­
posite material, with a pistol handle 
and a shoulder stock and a night-sight 
on top of it,” Mclnnis said. He said , 
Leonard can come in to pick up his 
rubber-band gun whenever he wants. ¦
Police offered no explanation for 
Leonard’s behavior.
Barrington Sgt. Dino DeCrescenzo said 
Leonard declined to answer police ques­
tions about why he was carrying the gun.
Thieves rob IGA 
store with gravy -
BENTONVILLE, Ark., April 5 (AP)'
— Two men armed with gravy mix and, 
pocket change cooked up a recipe for 
robbery.
Cynthia Bennett, a cashier at ; 
Barry’s IGA, had just completed bag< 
ging a customer’s food Tuesday when, 
a large man on crutches and an older ¿ 
man walked to the end of the counter. “
The smaller man dropped an 87-cent' 
bag of gravy mix onto the counter.
“The man handed me a $5 bill, and 
while I was taking it the larger man 
said, ‘Oh, if that’s all it is, I’ve got 87-¡ 
cents,’ and he threw out a lot of pennies ', 
on the counter and wanted me to count. 
the pennies,” she said.
While she was distracted, the smaller ’ 
man stepped into an adjacent aisle and 
grabbed about $60 from the open regis­
ter.
The cashier realized what had hap­
pened, and told the two men she would'1 
have to take the change to the office1 
because it wouldn’t fit inside the cash 
drawer.
“It was the only thing I could think of* 
at the time,” she said.
When Ms. Bennett remained near the;, 
office, it dawned on the robbers that ‘ 
something was up so they fled. u“

Carnegie Almanac
From National Weather Service bulletins and other sources
50 YEARS AGO, April 9,1946: 
Due to increased costs of opera­
tions, PresidentRobertE. Doherty 
announced that Carnegie Tech 
would raise tuition by a ghastly 
$25 per semester in the College of 
Engineering and Science and the 
College of Fine Arts. The charge 
for evening classes was to be in­
creased by $4.20 per unit in the 
engineering, sciences, and fine 
arts. The humanities courses saw 
a $3.60 increase per unit.
The increases were to be used 
to support the growing size of the 
faculty and help fund improve­
ments in dormitories and labora­
tories.
General finances of the insti­
tution were in a poor state. The 
rate of return on invested funds 
had fallen so much that income 
to the endowment from the Car­
negie Corporation merely com­
pensated for the losses.
25 YEARS AGO, April 8, 
1971: About 100 students and 
staff met in Skibo to protest the 
University for laying-off several 
C-MU service employees.
The workers were primarily 
upset because they had accepted
low-paying positions at the school 
after they were given verbal guar­
antees that they would not be 
laid off if they did their jobs well. 
However, the worker’s contracts 
contained no assurances of con­
tinued work and explicitly pro­
hibited verbal commitments of 
any kind. Thus, the protestors 
were depending on student sup­
port to pressure the administra­
tion to reconsider the layoffs.
10 YEARS AGO, April 8,1986: 
The City of Pittsburgh nearly 
denied Sweepstakes permits for 
closing city streets for the pre­
liminary buggy races. These races 
are traditionally held on Friday 
morning, but the city was con­
cerned about' blocking streets 
during rush hour.
Anne Witchner, director of stu­
dent activities, helped to work 
out the problem with the Depart­
ment of Parks and Recreation. 
The department did not realize 
that the roads would not be closed 
the entire time the permits re­
quested, 6 am to 1 pm. The per­
mits were issued on the condi­
tion that the streets would not be 
closed until 8:30 am.
5 YEARS AGO, April 15,1991: 
The five candidates for student 
body president scheduled a de­
bate in Porter Hall 100. Senate 
felt it was a good opportunity for 
the campus community to hear
what the candidates had to offer.- 
The evening was scheduled to;; 
begin with the introduction of the 
panel that would be questioning 
the candidates. Members of the 
panel included the WRCT gen­
eral manager, a member of the 
euCaImu rm,1m collective, the cur­
rent student body president, the 
editor-in-chief ofThe Tartan, and 
the dean of student affairs.
Each candidate was then to give 
a closing statement and then an­
swer questions from the audi­
ence. The next week, the commu­
nity could meet the candidates at 
a happy hour.

making Windows the preferred plat­
form for higher education.”
— George Norris, Microsoft

below prices found in superstores. Mod­
els to be sold include six Pentium-based 
configurations including desktops (sold 
in a mini-tower configuration) and a line 
Sbf notebook computers for mobile users.
One of the ways in which this program 
is different from other discount programs, 
according to the two companies, is the 
level of involvement with the participat­
ing universities. While Microsoft, Apple, 
Dell, and others vendors have special 
educational discounts on some products,
project which involves creating a secure 
web for storing the data about each 
college’s network configuration setup 
for downloading by students, faculty, 
and staff members.
“Another nice feature of the delivery 
mechanism we’ve created for the de­
livery software is we’ll be capturing 
people’s e-mail addresses,” said Lam­
bert of Zenith. This will allow for email 
to be sent to a user in order to notify 
them of new files available for imme­
diate downloading.
Microsoft’s goals for the 
program, George Norris 
said, “This strategy is spe­
cifically focused on really 
making Windows the pre­
ferred platform for higher 
education ... Now, as net­
working of these systems 
is becoming key, we’re try­
ing to give the universities 
and the students an incentive, if you 
will, to standardize, because that’s one 
of the best ways to assure minimal sup­
port for the university and the best pos­
sible experience for the students.”
As to the future of the program, Norris 
added “We see this program evolving from 
input from universities.... I think it’s a 
very good strong first step, but not where 
things will end.... So what I see this pro­
gram doing is [acting as] the beginning of 
a very long and tight engagement with 
higher education institutions to help meet 
their technology needs.”
Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Committees study 
minority presence
On Friday, April 5, Carnegie Mellon 
University announced the formation 
of five campus-wide committees to 
address problems and opportunities 
identified in the report, “The Status of 
Underrepresented Minorities at Car­
negie Mellon University.”
The report, focused primarily on 
African-Americans, included informa­
tion on the percentage of black faculty 
members on campus, enrollment of 
undergraduate and graduate black 
students, and the number of blacks in 
management positions at the Univer­
sity.
While the figures are similar to black 
representations at institutions like 
Carnegie Mellon, the committees are 
striving to improve those specific to 
the CMU community.
“We have been working at address­
ing some of these issues in recent years, 
for example, increasing our involve­
ment in K-12 education,, particularly 
in collaboration with schools in the 
Pittsburgh region, to help enlarge the 
pipeline of potential black students,” 
said Provost Paul Christiano, founder 
of the committees in a nolmIg,I iIMU
M1m vI0t article. “But this report dem­
onstrates that we must redouble our 
efforts, eliminate ineffective programs 
and replace them with those that will 
help us achieve our goal of a more 
diverse student body, faculty and work 
force.”
The committees will be focusing for 
the next two months on taking specific 
actions for the recruitment of minor­
ity faculty, undergraduate and gradu­
ate students, and staff members.
SDS announces 
department head
The college of Humanities and So­
cial Sciences appointed a new head of 
the Department of Social and Decision 
Sciences (SDS). William R. Keech, cur­
rently a professor of political science 
at the University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill will head the department 
starting January 1,1997.
“For SDS, Bill Keech makes an ex­
cellent match because of his deep in­
terest in the kind of interdisciplinary 
atmosphere that characterizes that 
department,” said Peter Stearns, dean 
of the College of Humanities and So­
cial Sciences.

“CMU is a closed bubble. I don’t 
think it should put us out in the 
cold world. They’ve been pretty 
lenient [with the alcohol cita­

undeclared H&SS sophomore.
Another concern about the new 
policy is whether students wor­
ried about citations will call EMS 
in an alcohol-related emergency. 
“As has always been the case, any 
call for medical assistance will not 
result in action against that stu­
dent. I am certain that students 
will always call when they feel a 
student needs assistance, and they 
can be assured they will not be 
putting that student at any risk of 
disciplinary action,” said Dean of 
Student Affairs Michael Murphy.
“As is now the case, requests for 
medical assistance from Campus 
Police or the EMS will be based on 
an individual basis. In the absence 
of other violations of University

imposition of disciplinary action

ing to LaPaglia in an open letter to 
the campus community.
LaPaglia also stressed that the 
alcohol policy isn’t changing. “The 
alcohol policy will not be chang­
ing, it’s just the protocol for how 
campus police are dealing with it 
[that is changing],” said LaPaglia.
“We’re hoping that a byproduct 
[of the change] is to increase 
people’s awareness that underage 
drinking is a violation of the com­
munity standards, and we hope 
that they’ll think twice aboutwhat 
it means to consume or possess 
alcohol,” said LaPaglia.

Campus events must 
increase publicity
Despite our reputation as an apa­
thetic college campus, many student 
organizations at CMU provide the 
community with diverse program­
ming in the form of events ranging 
from anti-rape demonstrations to 
annual Mobot races, each offering 
students some sort of outlet for de­
velopment outside of their academ­
ics. Unfortunately, many of these 
well-planned events go unnoticed 
due to a lack of publicity on part of 
the organizers.
Regardless of how interesting a 
speaker is or how educational a pro­
gram on writing resumes might be, 
they are useless unless students 
know about the event. On a campus 
such as ours where students must 
generally be pried from their work to 
begin with, it seems that a little 
more than the “when and where” 
about the event is necessary to bring 
people out. Advertising on campus 
that is most effective is that which 
makes an impact on a student body 
that tends not to take time to see 
what is going on around them.
Some of the existing forms of dis­
seminating information tend to be 
ineffective in many cases: posters 
and flyers have to go through a bu­
reaucratic process that causes them 
to get lost in the shuffle, before stu­
dents get a chance to see them. For 
example, if an organization wants to 
publicize an event in dormitory halls, 
postings must be distributed to a 
Resident Assistant, who then is ob­
ligated to hang up or pass them out 
to his or her residents. In some cir­
cumstances, the busy RA may not 
even get to the porstering; as it can 
be time-consuming and they typi­
cally have other, more-pertinent re­
sponsibilities. This process is a time- 
cqnsuming one that causes one per­
son to be responsible for spreading a 
great amount of information on all 
the events on campus.
¡Another problem in advertising on 
c4mpus is the lack of a central build­
ing that everyone enters on a daily 
basis. One might hope that the Uni­
versity Center will alleviate this 
nfeed.
¡One attempt to solve this problem 
i& the “Event Pub” boards that are
posted by the Student Activities Of­
fice. With an 8.5 x 11” sheet of paper 
hung on the backs of various doors 
throughout academic buildings, the 
Event Pub board tries to inform the 
campus of campus and community 
events. A few problems arise since it 
is difficult to read the Event Pub 
without getting hit in the head with 
the door, and all events cannot be 
included on a single sheet of paper. 
In addition, Event Pub is adminis­
tered, produced and distributed by a 
single person, and plans to include a 
second staffer are tentative pending 
funding.
It is ludicrous to believe that one 
person can adequately dissemenate 
any substantial volume of program­
ming information on his own. In ad­
dition, if it is to be a valuable pro­
gram, the Event Pub must be made 
larger and more attention-grabbing, 
it must be placed at eye-level, and 
should be moved from doorways. In 
addition, its staff and self-referen­
tial publicity must both be increased 
(i.e., advertise its existence to orga­
nizations and students). The Event 
Pub program is commendable in con­
cept, but its execution could stand 
some improvement.
It seems that central LED mes­
sage boards, placed strategically 
around campus, might be a possible 
remedy to help the publicity prob­
lems that many organizations face. 
Some common points that all stu­
dents are aware of certainly would 
make an effective communication a 
solution.
It seems that although organiza­
tions on campus do expend signifi­
cant time, energy, and funds on pro­
gramming, they sometimes do not 
concentrate on bulding a leading, 
public image for the organization; a 
condition that contributes to a lack 
of awareness of its events.
If organizations take an active role 
in self-promotion and develop a high- 
profile, word of mouth will tend to 
publicize the events they plan. Until 
then, organizations must be asser­
tive and creative in their publicity 
efforts, offering incentive to students 
to attend events.

Reader speaks 
for conservatives
Editor: s- B yTR
In his article “Colum­
nist confronts conser­
vatives,” Mr. Jon Orris 
claims “America has 
never had an explicit 
moral purpose.”
America’s purpose is stated in the Dec­
laration of Independence: “We hold these 
truths to be self-evident, that all men are 
created equal, that they are endowed by 
their Creator with certain inalienable 
Rights, that among these are Life, Lib­
erty, and the pursuit of Happiness.
“That to secure these rights, Govern­
ments are instituted among Men, deriving 
their just powers from the consent of the 
governed.”
Mr. Orris wants an anarchic right to do 
what one pleases, saying to the govern­
ment: “Get the hell out of the way.” 
Government exists to protect a person’s 
life, so that he may use his liberty, his 
freedom under the law, to pursue happi­
ness; the use of earthly goods to pursue 
heaven, which is man’s last end.
Mr. Orris confuses this by insisting that 
the government should protect the right to 
life, while denying that right to the un­
born: “To reinstate a ban on abortion would 
be an unspeakable violation of human 
rights.” Perhaps he never read that line in 
biology texts when they discuss human 
life: “Human life begins at fertilization.” 
There is no “human right” to murder chil­
dren.
Finally, Mr. Orris claims, “Any justifica­
tion [conservatives] give for freedom and 
capitalism rests on tradition, faith, and 
“the common good.”
Our Constitution is meant to “... estab­
lish justice, insure domestic tranquility, 
provide for the common defence, promote 
the general welfare...”
In fact, political scientists say a law not 
for the common good with the intention of 
making good citizens, is not a real law. 
Aristotle (Ethics 2,1) writes, “The inten­
tion of every lawgiver is to make good 
citizens.” Aquinas (Summa, pt 1-2, q 92, a 
1) writes, “For if the intention of the law­
giver is fixed on the true good, which is the 
common good regulated according to Di­
vine justice, it follows that the effect of the 
law is to make men good.”
Summarizing such thoughts, George 
Washington said in his Farewell Address: 
“Of all the dispositions and habits which 
lead to political prosperity, religion and 
morality are indispensable supports. It is 
impossible to rightly govern the world 
without God and the Bible.”
And Senator Daniel Webster expanded:
“Our ancestors established their system 
of government on morality and religious 
sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, 
cannot safely be entrusted on any other 
foundation than religious principle, not 
any government secure which is not 
supported by moral habits.... Whatever 
makes men good Christians, makes them 
good citizens.”
Attacking America’s Christian foun­
dation in natural law and the common 
good by promoting absolute freedom 
without regard to others is a direct at­
tack on America, Christian religion, and 
God.

Your article “Dean 
overrules allocation 
decision” misrepre­
sented my position. I 
am not a supporter of 
FCCA (because I am 
pro-choice), but I am a supporter of their 
right to free expression and equal treat­
ment.
A few years ago, I told Dean Murphy 
that the University should remain neu­
tral on religious issues by not granting 
office space to the IVCF or any religious 
organization. I also pointed out that the 
IVCF’s religious political extremist views 
denigrate gay and lesbian people. Dean 
Murphy chose to grant the office space 
anyway.
But now Dean Murphy has rejected 
office space for a religious group, placing 
the University in the position of actively 
promoting one religion over another. 
This is discrimination on the basis of 
religion. I am also disturbed that the 
University now supports a religious 
group which is anti-gay but rejected one 
which is not.
Because Dean Murphy is very busy, I 
doubt he had time to analyze the rami­
fications of his decision. Now that he is 
aware, I have faith that he will take the 
moral high road and move the Univer­
sity to a position of equality (by granting 
office space without regard to the con­
tent of the message) or religious neutral­
ity (by not granting office space to any 
religious group).

Editor:
I would like to re­
spond to your edito­
rial in the March 18 
issue of The Tartan.
Early this semes­
ter, Student Government enacted the 
Organizational Liaison program in or­
der create a greater awareness among 
organizations and Student Government 
as to what the others are doing.
To define this desire to support c 
nizations, the organizational liaisons are 
charged with working with organiza­
tions on four general points: publicity,1 
programming, recruitment, and fiscal 
management.
This is not meant to assume that Stu­
dent Government is the authority in 
these areas. That is hardly our claim. 
However, we do have the ability to be-’ 
come an information clearinghouse about 
events, recruiting, etc. For example, one 
organization may have a very effective 
method of recruiting members.
The organizational liaison’s role would 
be to learn about that method and offer1 
it as a suggestion to an organization 
which is having recruitment difficulties.
In no way were the organizational 
liaisons empowered to dictate to the 
organizations how to run activities or 
anything of that nature. However, your 
editorial implies that they do.
I fail to see how this program classifies 
Student Government as a “ballooning 
bureaucracy.”
I would also like to point out the fact 
the new vice president does not monitor, 
Senate committees as your editorial 
states.
Your editorial also states that if Stu­
dent Government wants to improve com­
munications with organizations, that 
perhaps the organizations should send 
representatives to Senate.
I .agree that, ideally, this would be 
true.
However, this has not been the case. 
In an attempt to outreach to the organi­
zations, the organizational liaisons were 
formed.
I do appreciate your acknowledgment 
of the fact that we are a new, energetic 
Student Government this semester.
We will continue to work on improving 
our effectiveness and image here at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Your comments have been well noted, 
and yes, even appreciated.

Polic eimdfy
The results of 
our “Write a slo­
gan for Pitts­
burgh” contest 
have been over­
whelming, with
_________________________________________ well-over four
readers entering.
Sure, that may not sound like a lot to you, but when you 
consider that people have been elected to Student Senate 
with fewer than four votes, that’s pretty dam impressive.
This contest began two weeks ago, when I wrote that the 
state had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for its new 
slogan, “Pennsylvania Memories Last a Lifetime.” I ques­
tioned not only the price, which seems excessive for a motto 
that’s as memorable as vanilla ice cream, but also its 
appropriateness for Pittsburgh.
Here we have a plethora of responses, all tailor-made for 
the Steel City (for the next contest, maybe we’ll pick a new 
nickname). 1 got them for the price of a few electronic 
impulses flung across the Andrew network. Think of the 
money I could save the state! (Gov. Ridge, if you’re hiring, 
I’m available.)
These slogans have been carefully evaluated by a crack 
team of judges, who carefully debated their merits over 
pancakes and coffee at 2 a.m. at Eat ‘n Park. Each winner 
will receive an authentic piece of local history: a seven- 
ounce returnable glass “pop” bottle from Pittsburgh’s Re­
gent Bottling Co. Not only are they a real collectible,
suitable for a knick-knack shelf, target practice, or the 
recycling bin, but I get to clear some of the pesky devils out 
of my garage. I briefly toyed with the idea of awarding the 
first place winner one pop bottle, the second place winner 
two, the third place winner three, etc., but decided that was 
cruel.
Our fourth-place winner is a CMU staifer who wishes to 
remain anonymous (and no, it’s not any outgoing University 
presidents you’re familiar with). This staifer wrote, ‘Yunz 
can betcher babushka yunz are in the ‘Burgh,” which we all 
liked for its good use of the regional dialect. It would have 
ranked higher except that it kept making me hungry for 
pierogies and chipped-ham sandwiches.
The third place winner comes from a Pitt student, Tony 
Novosel (note to potential advertisers: how’s that for circu­
lation?). While our judges, made up of a Penn Stater, a Point 
Park student, a Case Western expatriate, and me briefly 
debated excluding everyone from Pitt, we put aside our 
pettiness and recognized Tony’s contribution, “Pittsburgh: 
You can't get there from here.” Nice job, Tony, and be careful 
crossing Bigelow Boulevard.
Our second place winner is Gustavo Sganzerla, an ECE 
major who’s nothing if not prolific. Gustavo contributed nine 
slogans, including, “You’ve got a friend in Pittsburgh, but if 
she goes to CMU, you can forget about that friendship 
turning into a relationship or sex,” ‘You’ve got a friend in 
Pittsburgh, but you wish they lived in Hawaii, so you could 
go there for spring break,” and “Pittsburgh — America

Overbearing salespeople pose threat to sanity
______ afyfh tinpclic
erhaps some 
of you, much 
like myself, 
have held re­
tail jobs in the 
past. You 
know, like Ser­
vice Merchan­
dise, Circuit 
City, or Sears.
But if you’re 
not one of the 
privileged few 
who have worked in such a place, 
I’m sure some ofyou have shopped 
•in these stores during various 
stages of your life. This being the 
case, everyone is familiar with 
the sudden appearance of a sales­
person swooping down upon you 
and saying: “May I help you?” 
Regardless of your answer, the 
salesperson will most probably 
offer other tidbits of info concern­
ing how happy they are to help 
you, how wonderful the store is, 
and if you need any more help, 
just come to them. Great... or is 
it?
Is it great when the saleperson 
happens to be a fumbling teen­
ager who knows nothing about 
the merchandise they’re ped­
dling? This was me, trying to push 
grills, baby equipment, and a 
plethora of other goodies on wit­
less customers two years ago in 
Service Merchandise. With only 
a couple of hours of training un­
der my belt, I was expected to 
know which grills used volcanic 
rocks, just how the baby seat was 
affixed to the car, and the 
manufacturer’s warranty on all 
the merchandise in the joint.
Secondly, most stores have 
some type of commission plan to 
get their employees to be even 
more irritating and annoying in 
hopes of personal gain. It is no 
wonder customers might get 
turned off when the salesperson 
always, always thinks the higher- 
up model is just “the better deal.” 
Why shouldn’t a customer get
annoyed when an extended war­
ranty is pushed upon them for 
the rcth time? Yet, most busi­
nesses expect the employees to 
do this dirty work, and even talk 
to their employees if they aren’t 
selling enough. But why doesn’t 
the management realize a major­
ity of customers do not care for 
this method of aggressive sales?
Most stores evaluate their em­
ployees to see if they are efficient 
salespeople. I once worked at a 
bookstore, and they evaluated 
their employees in many areas to 
determine if they were a “Best 
Seller.” These areas ranked from 
“smiling” to “entering into the art 
of the sale” all the way down to 
“helping the customer make the 
decision to buy.”
There are inherent problems 
with this list for two reasons. 
One, it is not the salesperson’s 
decision whether the customer 
should buy! Secondly, I was work­
ing in a bookstore, a place of re­
flection and intelligence. I mean, 
who makes the decision to read 
Herman Melville’s i1&c P,wp 
based on the recommendation of
the one person who would profit 
from its purchase?
Maybe I am a little more emo­
tional about the issue than you 
are, but that is because I suffered 
through it. So read on, I’m not 
through yet.
The maxim, “The customer is 
always right” could not be far­
ther from the truth. One customer 
asked me if they could get a dis­
count on a book “because it was 
the last one on the shelf.” An­
other one asked if they should 
“sign where it says signature.” A 
lot of customers confused their 
zip codes with their phone num­
bers.
Maybe I am being petty, but 
after a long day of work, the last 
thing I want to hear is “Are you 
sure you don’t have this item in 
the back?” as if “the back” is this 
magical place holding all the de­
sired merchandise that the store 
just chooses not to sell.
What is the source of all these 
problems? First, it is because of 
the directives by the higher lev­
els of management. The execu­
tives have no sense of the effects
of store policy. Pushing sales will 
not increase sales; from a cus­
tomer standpoint, it turns cus­
tomers off. Yet management pres­
sures employees to act in these 
irritating ways, without realiz­
ing they are chasing the custom­
ers away. Second, people can be 
animals. They can be exteremely 
disrespectful, self-centered, and 
rude.
So this is my message to all you 
potential customers: do not be 
stupid! Show some respect.
Let me conclude with this part­
ing story: the one bookstore I 
worked in had two floors. The top 
floor had a huge stairwell leading 
downstairs, and above this stair­
well was a large neon sign that 
said “Children’s Books Down­
stairs” and a huge neon arrow 
pointing down.
So who wants to guess how 
many people asked where 
children’s books were?

Columnist examines government taxation mess
PoCfl sbfuocfh
As they always say, there are two things 
that are sure in life: death and taxes. 
While we go to great lengths to avoid or 
make bearable the first of these inevitable 
things, we seem to have done little to make 
the latter palatable. We’re about to face 
taxes coming down the line in the middle 
of April, and it seems like a good time to 
contemplate the subject.
Presently, however, we have seen some 
measure of discussion in public forums on 
our current primary system of taxation: 
the income tax. This is the tax in which 
people are made to surrender portions of 
their income which increases with the 
amount of money earned. This is defined 
in political jargon as a “progressive tax.” 
The real translation is a “screw-the-rich 
tax.” Of course, even the definition of “rich” 
is a little flexible.
The income tax has an interesting his­
tory. The first one in this nation was a 
wartime tax during the Civil War which 
was repealed after hostilities ceased. A 
later peacetime income tax was passed in 
1894, but was struck down by the Su­
preme Court (ah, the high court of the old 
days). This led to congress doing some­
thing unheard of these days: trying to 
expand their power in a constitutional 
manner. They passed an amendment to 
the Constitution. This was Amendment 
16, which was ratified in 1913.
Originally, this tax was basically sup­
posed to be a “screw-the-rich tax,” which 
really did start out at high income levels. 
It featured a graduated scale which started 
at 1 percent up to $20,000 and went up to 
7 percent for incomes above $500,000 with 
a $3,000 exemption for a single filer and 
$4,000 for two. Mind you this was back in 
1913, and we have to adjust the dollar 
value to give you a clear picture of what 
this means.
First the deduction. Well the $3,000 
and $4,000 translate to $44,776 and 
$59,701 respectively. The end of the ini­
tial bracket comes in at $298,507 and the 
top bracket started at about $7.5 million 
a year. Does this sound anything like 
what we have today? I can’t say it does 
when a grad student working for a sti­
pend (translation: peanuts) has to pay 
income taxes. I as­
sure you my recom­
pense is nowhere 
near $44K a year.
What happened?
Well, you see, there’s 
the fact that tax 
laws once passed 
don’t get updated 
very often. When 
they do, it’s usually 
for the worse. A 
friend pointed out 
the fact to me re­
cently that once a 
bracket is set, it 
doesn’t really keep 
up with the cost of 
living increases that 
occur naturally. A 
number that ap­
pears to be a large 
salary today won’t 
quite be so high in 
10 years, so sud­
denly someone who
never thinks of themselves as rich man­
aged to creep up into the “getting screwed” 
bracket.
Also, I’d like to remind you that a major­
ity of CMU graduates are going to be right 
in the sights of the tax collectors. You will 
graduate and fork over about 1/3 of what 
you earn in just federal taxes. This does 
not include Social Security (which you 
will never see again, so call it a tax like the 
rest), local, and state taxes. Depending on 
where you live, this can be on the order of 
half of your earnings. Do you really think 
the services provided by the government 
are worth having you spend a third to a 
half of the year in indentured servitude 
paying for them? Oh yes. It’s also inden­
tured servitude, since if you try to escape 
it, you will bring the burden of federal 
enforcers down on you.
Of course there are deductions, tax shel­
ters, and whatnot. You can often reduce 
the burden to a more manageable level. 
Things like the home mortgage deduction 
which subsidizes housing, municipal 
bonds, and other such write-offs. These
HS& ntvau'P Tartan Art Staff
loopholes are generally methods by which 
the government tries to make you do things 
they like. Essentially they’re saying you 
can have some of your labor back if you do 
what they wish. The real meaning of the 
tax system amounts to power. The power 
to promote some activities and favor some 
groups over others.
The funny thing about all these loop­
holes is that it usually takes a good lawyer 
to find all of them. Now, you may ask 
“Who can afford a good lawyer?” The rich, 
of course. A good example of how powerful 
a good tax lawyer can be is the Kennedys. 
At present there is something called the 
Estate Tax. This is a tax where if you die, 
what you leave to offspring (or others
besides a wife) is taxed at 50 percent (after 
an exemption of $500,000 or so). Now the 
Kennedys somehow have managed to keep 
their family in the realm of the extremely 
rich after not making any significant 
money since prohibition. That’s a damn 
good lawyer. All the other poor schmoes 
out there would be taking a 50 percent hit 
per generation.
Even with the ability of the rich to evade 
some of their taxes (only the extremely 
rich can afford those lawyers), they still 
pay the majority of income taxes. The top 
20 percent of incomes pay 60 percent of the 
taxes and the top 40 percent pay 80 per­
cent. Mind you this is not directly propor­
tional to the amount of money they make, 
remember this is a “progressive” system. 
Somehow I don’t see this as anything ap­
proaching fair. If you somehow see this as 
fair, would you also accept restaurants 
charging those who dress better more for 
their food? It’s the same thing. You are 
charging more for the same service (not 
even just proportionally more).
So what exactly is my point? Well, you 
see, we have a system which is not only 
unfair, but doesn’t even succeed in its 
original pretext, which is to make the 
really rich people pay. The brackets have 
been creeping down since the inception of 
the tax, and now almost everyone pays. 
This is simply caused by the lack of those 
really rich people. If the tax base isn’t very 
large, the revenue will be small. We all 
know how little the government likes to 
live on a small income. Just observe the 
kind of rancor coming out from the Demo­
crats over attempts to balance the budget 
by freezing spending, much less cuts. Also 
those rich people can afford the means by 
which one can find loopholes.
The more we complicate the laws to 
make things more “fair,” the more loop­
holes are created. In my next column I’ll go 
over some of the proposed solutions to our 
current mess such as the flat tax and 
national sales tax.

Welfare housing proves inefficient form of state-supported aid
Pic gyypl
The U.S. government has come 
up with an interesting new plan 
to “end welfare as we know it.” 
Due to a settlement in a lawsuit 
that began a decade ago, the de­
partment of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) plans to 
purchase 23 homes, valued be­
tween $50,000 and $100,000, in 
the municipalities surrounding 
Pittsburgh, and turn them over 
to welfare recipients. They plan 
to purchase 100 over the next few 
years. HUD, after several decades 
of devastating the inner cities, 
has conceded failure and is mov­
ing on to the suburbs. Pittsburgh, 
of course, is only their first step. 
Their goal is to make public hous­
ing and welfare recipients indis­
tinguishable from regular people.
This, I submit, is an obscenity, 
and a clear sign that America is 
heading ever more swiftly to­
wards destruction. There are so 
many things that are vile and 
evil about this plan I hardly know 
where to begin.
Let’s start with the notion of 
giving people on welfare houses. 
People who own homes usually 
spend many years saving up un­
til they have a large enough down 
payment that they can afford to 
get a mortgage. They 01lp for it, 
and they continue to 01lp to make 
their monthly payments. Yet the 
government has the gall to sim­
ply give away expensive homes to 
people who have m1u worked, who 
have m1u saved, who have m1u 
earned the right to the property. 
Why should anyone try anymore, 
why should anyone work for a 
living, if, by virtue of the fact that 
you have achieved nothing, ev­
erything will be given to you? 
Why indeed, should anyone wish 
to work when the more they
struggle, the more they succeed, 
the more they earn, the more is 
taken from them to feed those 
who don’t try?
After all, the “winners in life’s 
lottery” must “pay their fair 
share,” say the advocates of com­
passion and social justice.
I’ve said it before, but it bears 
repeating: does it make you feel 
good that after all your years of 
work and struggle here at CMU, 
it turns out that the struggle 
wasn’t for your sake, but for the 
sake of those who didn’t struggle? 
Does it make you feel good that 
all your years of learning are the 
equivalent of a cow being fat­
tened for slaughter?
Does it make you feel good that 
the more you earn, the more you’ll 
pay, that the first claim on your 
ability, on your effort, on your 
M,9I, belongs to any stray beggar 
who is incapable of rousing him­
self to any effort?
The entire welfare system is a 
gross sham. It has destroyed the 
inner city, caused poverty and
crime to skyrocket, and has dev­
astated the black community be­
yond the wildest dreams of any 
white-sheeted bigot. It has taught 
people that they don’t have to 
work, they don’t have to think, 
and that their mIIa is an undeni­
able claim on anyone, that they 
have only to demand and some­
one will provide. It has achieved 
nothing but destruction.
Welfare is not an issue of char­
ity. Ayn Rand once said, “Do not 
hide behind such superficialities 
as whether you should or should 
not give a dime to a beggar.
That is not the issue. The issue 
is whether you a1 or do m1u have 
the right to exist 0,uN1Cu giving 
him that dime.”
The government has been an­
swering for decades, “No, you 
have m1 l,gNu to exist without 
giving that dime, along with a 
few thousand here from your in­
come tax, a few thousand there 
for Social Security, several thou­
sand on those capital gains, to 
any beggar that demands it of
you.
What appalls and frightens 
me is the fact that so many, so 
tragically frighteningly many 
people seem to see nothing wrong 
with this state of affairs. In the 
case of HUD’s recent insanity, 
the communities about to have 
it inflicted on them are natu­
rally protesting.
However, for the most part, 
they are only protesting the 
number or cost of homes that 
HUD plans to buy, not their right 
to do so in the first place. HUD 
has already won. Its opponents 
conceded the moral high ground 
to them. The rest is just a matter 
of time.
To think that this is a nation 
that went to war for indepen­
dence over, among other things, 
a few percent tax on tea and 
paper, that now sees nothing 
wrong in principle with the IRS, 
sees nothing wrong with taxes 
on the order of 50 percent, is 
astounding.
To think that a nation founded
on the principle of the inalienable 
rights of the individual, the prin­
ciple that a man has a right to 
exist for his 10m sake, to seek his 
10m happiness, has so deeply ac­
cepted the cannibalistic morality 
of altruism, makes me ill.
I ask you to think about this. 
Are you going to let this sort of 
thing continue?
Are you going to allow the great­
est country ever to arise on earth 
to turn into a socialist dictator­
ship?
Are you going to continue to 
allow yourself to be used as slave 
labor?
Are you going to continue to 
elect the same socialist liberals or 
compromising conservatives?
Are you going to continue to 
blind your eyes, say “things aren’t 
that bad” or “you can’t change the 
system,” or “who am I to act?”
Do you want to live or not?

Late-night TV supplies doses of sarcasm
eiC Uoyufy
Usually when my sleep sched­

some late-night television. Re­
ally late nights, I mean. That’s 
when the really good stuff is on.
Of course, it depends on the 
day of the week which of the

truly good/bad/so-bad-it’s-good is on. Weekdays are usually filled 
with infomercials about foreclosing on your friends’ houses for fun
and profit, revolutionary Ronco 
products, or talk shows. Ricki 
Lake used to be on at 1:30 am 
on Monday.
Weekends, however, have 
movies the proverbial “they” 
would never even think about 
showing during the day, and 
phone sex ads.

“Hello. CMU Psychics Hotline.”
“Uhhh ... do you do Tarot readings?”
“Sure. The Fool — expect a run of bad luck. The Wheel of 
Misfortune — don’t take any big gambles. In fact, don’t even leave 
your house. The Buttmunch — which is what you and your whole 
family are. Have a nice day.”
“Wait a minute! There’s no ‘Buttmunch’ card!”
“And how do you know? I’m the psychic here.”
“Oh... I guess you’re right.”
“Yes. Trust not the ways of the laymen. Seek the advice of the 
gifted.”
“Oh ... Will I find love in the near future?”
“Hmmm ... I doubt it, sport.”
“Why? I must know why!”
“Okay ... you call psychic hotlines at 1:30 am. There’s probably a 
party out there somewhere, buttmunch. Try going to one.” 
“Thanks. How about money?”
“Oh, I don’t need to worry about money. This line’s four dollars a 
minute ....”

All are terrific, but the one 
that took the second-place prize 
was “Pittsburgh memories last 
too long.” We liked the fact 
that it could be interpreted 
many ways, and that it tied in 
with the state’s new tourism 
slogan. Gustavo also suggested 
using as Pittsburgh’s theme 
songan oldFrankSiaatra tune, 
the one that begins, “Start 
spreading the news, I’m leav­
ing today,” but I think that’s 
been taken by some other , less- 
important city.
The grand-prize winner 
comes from Greensburg resi­
dent and CivE major Rebecca 
Buchheit, who was “shocked” 
by my exposé of abnormal be­
havior among Pittsburghers. 
“Having lived in Pittsburgh my
whole life, I never realized 
these things were abnormal,” 
she wrote. Rebecca’s sugges­
tion, which we will forward to 
Mayor Murphy’s office imme­
diately, is “Pittsburgh: If you 
live here long enough, it starts 
to seem normal.”
I thank all of our winners 
for entering, and for the nice

Akira Hasegawa/Tartan Art Staff infomercials/investigative re­
ports about psychic hotlines. First, Dionne Warwick made the 
marketing decision of the century by joining the Psychic Friends. 
Nobody thinks of her illustrious singing career anymore, do they? 
Instead, she brazenly extols the virtues of this hotline that for some 
reason can alter the fabric of space and time and predict the future 
just the way you want to hear it. She even got “CHiPs” star Erik 
Estrada to star in the infomercials using the feigned-enthusiasm 
voice so familiar to those of us who went to Sunday school.
Now Billy Dee Williams has a psychic hot-line of his own. Sooner 
or later each celebrity will have a hotline to hawk on late-night 
television. I can see it coming. Insomniacs will take over TV stations 
in the middle of the night just so they can stop the glut of hotline ads. 
Anarchy is the next logical step.So, we as a community should take 
a preventive step — have a hotline of our own. Not only would thisCt a just that some of us are holder^

East seeks Wings challenger
On Net
by Jessica Strelitz 
& Chris Adukaitis
All year long, we have seen the 
resurgence of the KLM line and 
the fluid silent skating of the 
Detriot Red Wings steamroll ev­
erything in their way. The ques­
tion hasn’t been “what will the 
race in the East and West look 
like?” Rather its been much more 
like, “The Red Wings vs the East 
— who can stand up?”
God I hate them, but they’ll make 
it to the Eastern Finals and fall 
to Philly.
John Leclair has led the Flyers 
on a 10-1—1 charge, which is ex­
actly what this streaky team 
needs heading into the playoffs. 
Bobby Clarke has done an excel­
lent job acquiring players to add 
depth behind the Legion of Doom 
(Eric Desjardins, Pat Falloon, 
Joel Otto, Dan Quinn). Chris — 
The only question for the Flyers 
is Ronny Hextall. Will he stay 
healthy? Will he repeat his chok­
ing act in last year’s semi-finals? 
If the answers are yes and no, 
then look for the Flyers to bull 
their way to the Stanley Cup. 
Jess — The Flyers have looked 
like their ‘old selves,’ dominat­
ing everyone who comes within
way to the fifth seed. Chris — 
Unless they can steal third place 
from the Rangers, they won’t win 
a series. Jess — The Habs have 
become the second youngest 
team in the league, and shown 
that they can do it without Roy 
and with Tremblay, but the 25th 
Cup is still far away.
The Bruins have made some 
key acquisitions (Rick Tochett 
and Bill Ranford) to keep their 
playoff appearance streak to a 
record 29 straight. Chris — If 
they can move up a seed or two, 
they will win their first series. 
But this team just has too many 
holes to seriously contend for the 
Cup. Jess — Even without their 
scoring punch of Neely, the Bru­
ins have played incredibly clean 
(least penalized team in the NHL)
THE GURUS’ PICKS 
The Detroit Red Wings 
vs the Eastern Conference
1. Pittsburgh Penguins
2. Philadelphia Flyers
3. New York Rangers
4. Florida Panthers
5. Montreal Canadiens
Last year it was the Devils; the 
upset in four games shocked and 
saddened the Wings’ superb sea­
son. They seem to have it all: 
superstars, veterans, fabulous 
goaltending, and so many wins 
that they were on their way to 
breaking the Canadien’s long­
standing record.
Who will it be this year?
Pittsburgh currently sits atop 
the Eastern Conference, and 
should cruise through the first 
round of the playoffs. The Pen­
guins have the best offense in the 
league (including the top three 
scorers) as well as a dominating 
power play. Special teams are 
crucial in the playoffs. But then, 
so is defense; and that’s what the 
Pens are lacking.
Their blue line is young, inex­
perienced, and, as of late, plagued 
by injuries. Hence, they have 
padded their roster with several 
young players who will be seeing 
playoff time in the NHL for the 
first time. Chris — The front 
office’s failure to trade for some 
defensive depth before the trad­
ing deadline will cost the Pen­
guins the championship. Jess —
stick’s length. But I doubt that 
they can manhandle the mes­
merizing Red Wings.
Mark Messier continues to 
amaze at 36 years of age. He has 
carried the inconsistent Rangers 
on his back all year. The team 
has plenty of talent with the likes 
of Brian Leetch, Pat Verbeek, 
and Alexei Kovalev, but injuries 
and sub-par play has hindered 
the team. New York is a veteran 
team, though, and could easily 
win the East. Chris — Detroit 
will prove to be too big a chal­
lenge. Jess — Good work at the 
trading buzzer, but Messier can’t 
win it alone.
The Panthers early in the sea­
son were all the talk on the street, 
but the hype and the wins have 
been disappearing. Chris—The 
Beezer will guide them through 
the first round, but inexperience 
and a lack of talent will prevent 
them from going any further. 
Jess — The expansion team’s 
first playoff berth won’t get them 
far... this year.
The Canadiens have steadily 
improved throughout the season 
and have managed to claw their
Kurt Bezes/Tartan Junior Staff
and well-balanced hockey in their 
past 15 games, going 10-2-3. 
They’ll make it to the second, but 
the Fleet Center won’t have a 
Cup christening for a few years.
Jim Carey has had an excel­
lent sophomore season and was 
March’s player of the month. 
Chris — The Capitals are al­
ways a difficult team to play in 
the playoffs, and should upset in 
the first round and maybe the 
second as well. Jess—The Caps 
bite it in the first round. They 
can’t hide behind Carey’s glove 
and Dale’s fist forever.
Tampa Bay Lightning round 
out the pack with a quiet position 
that surprises many. Chris — 
Won’t happen. Jess — They’re 
swept in the first.

Summer decisions define! next NCAA powerhouses
The Sixth Man
by Ronak Singhal
Another NCAA tournament 
has come and gone, so it’s time to 
start looking towards next year. 
But like this season 
in college basketball, 
what happens in the 
next several months 
off the court will af­
fect the season as 
much’ as anything 
during the season.
This year in college 
basketball was 
shaped by those un­
derclassmen who left 
(Rasheed Wallace,
Jerry Stackhouse,
Joe Smith), and those 
who were about to 
leave school but 
changed their mind 
(John Wallace).
Think of how 
strong the ACC 
would have been if 
Stackhouse, Wallace, 
and Smith had 
stayed in school. Add 
those players to 
Wake Forest’s Tim 
Duncan and those 
four players could 
have rivaled the Big 
East’s terrific quar­
tet of Kerry Kittles,
Ray Allen, Allen 
Iverson, and John 
Wallace. The loss of 
these key players was the main 
reason that the ACC did not send 
a team to the Final Four for the 
first time in quite a few years.
Then there’s the story of John 
Wallace. He announced that he 
was foregoing his senior year at 
Syracuse and was making him­
self eligible for -the NBA draft. 
But two days before the draft 
was to take place, Wallace had a 
change of heart and decided to 
return to school. Under a new 
NCAA bylaw, athletes may do 
this as long as they don’t sign 
with an agent, which Wallace 
had not done. So instead of sit­
ting on the bench for some NBA 
team, or maybe even being rel­
egated to the CBA, Wallace led 
Syracuse into battle this season 
and was impressive enough in 
the regular season to be named a 
second-team All-American.
But Wallace’s work was just 
beginning. Syracuse was fortu­
nate enough to be placed in the 
weakest of the four regionals of 
the NCAA tournaments, and 
then received the good fortune of
watching both Memphis and top- 
seeded Purdue being upset. So, 
they ended up facing Georgia in 
the third round in a game that 
will be remembered for a very 
long time for its incredible fin­
ish. First, with seconds remain­
ing in the game, Wallace threw 
an absolutely unbelievable pass 
three-quarters the length and 
width of the court. It was right 
on the money to Jason Cipolla, 
who buried the shot to send the 
game into overtime.
Akira Hasegawa/Tartan,
In overtime, Syracuse took the 
lead late, but Georgia hit a three- 
pointer to steal the lead with 
only seconds remaining. This 
time, Wallace dribbled down and 
hit a three-pointer of his own to 
give Syracuse the win.
And from there, Syracuse was 
able to ride the shoulders of 
Wallace all the way to the cham­
pionship game, where they lost 
to a Kentucky team that was just 
a little too deep for them to 
handle. It also should be noted 
that, in my opinion, the naming 
of Tony Delk as the Final Four’s 
Most Outstanding Player was 
wrong. Delk had a great tourna­
ment, including tying a tourna­
ment record with seven three- 
pointers in the final, but if there 
was a more outstanding player 
in the tournament than John 
Wallace, I didn’t see it.
Also, the dominance of the SEC 
should be noted. Although this 
conference had not been highly 
regarded throughout the season, 
it had a marvelous post-season 
with both the men’s and women’s
conference champions coming 
from the SEC. Syracuse should 
apply for honorary membership 
in the conference; three of their 
last four games were agains 
SEC foes.
So, which Wallace will thi£ 
year’s underclassmen follow 
Rasheed or John? Already 
Stephon Marbury (Georgia 
Tech), Ronnie Henderon 
(LSU), Darnell Robinson (Arl 
kansas), and Lorenzen Wright 
(Memphis) have annoujiceti 
their intentions to 
leave school early ¿for 
the NBA.
But the announce*- 
ments from the ¡big 
names, such as Marpu£ 
Camby, Tim Dunc’an‘ 
Allen Iverson, and Ray 
Allen, are still to come;. 
If any of these players 
stay for their next yeaf 
in school, all woultj 
propel their teams» t$ 
preseason top-five ^ta|- 
tus merely becaus^ of 
their presence. Anti i!t 
would not be entirely 
surprising to see ' all 
four of these players 
stay in school for one 
more year.
The two that would 
be the least likely to stay 
would be Allen anil 
Camby, since they re­
ally have the least' to 
prove by playing college 
hoops for one more year. 
But wouldn’t it be nice 
to see a clash betweeh 
UMass and EVOMYWI ^ritk 
both of these players? 
As for Allen Iverson, Ke 
seems to have accepted 
the teachings of<Jolin 
Thompson and if the coach tells 
him to stay, he’ll stay.
Finally, there’s Tim Duncan. 
Many people think he would 
have been the first player drafted 
had he declared himself for thfe 
draft last year. But this talented 
center loves campus life so mucli, 
it looks like he might stay thfc 
entire four years. That really 
says something for life at Wake 
Forest, because I think if any 
student at CMU had the choice 
between another year here or 
signing a contract for several 
million dollars, their choice 
would be obvious.
Expect Kansas to be the num­
ber one team in the land when 
next year starts. But it will be a 
team with more experience than 
the Jayhawks, most likely one of 
the teams led by one of the afore«- 
mentioned superstars, who’ll 
make the noise next season. ¦

potential holds, they will only fall short of a world 
championship, and Johnson will get the benefits.
A.L. General Manager of the Year — Pat
Gillick, Baltimore Orioles; now that the best GM 
in the past two decades is back in the game, it is 
only fitting that he re-introduce himself with 
success. The off-season additions of B. J. Surhoff, 
Kent Mercker, Alomar, and most of all Johnson 
will bring a smile to Gillick’s face in October.
A.L. Comeback Player of the Year—Dwight 
Gooden, New York Yankees; Doc is throwing in 
the mid 90s once again, and has added a few 
breaking pitches to his repertoire. Should he even 
encounter limited success, considering all the 
trials and tribulations he has been through, he is 
an easy shoe-in for this award.

Columnist sets spring predictions
The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
The season is well underway, 
and though the weather may not 
be cooperating, it is a reassuring 
feeling when the boys of summer 
take the field (especially when 
it’s on time).
With a week gone by, I’ve heard 
everything from the Bucs’ earn­
ing the National League wild card 
berth to the Phillies rookie 
pitcher, Mike Grace, earning 
Rookie ofthe Year honors. Though 
the Pirates are certainly a formi­
dable team and Grace has good 
stuff, it’s time for people to get 
their heads on straight and pay 
serious attention to the fol­
lowing predictions.
National League MVP— 
Ryan Klesko, Atlanta Braves; 
two years ago, Klesko dem­
onstrated his potential but still 
had a number of holes in his 
game. Last year, after returning 
from an injury which stifled a 
potentially stellar year, Klesko 
hit 23 home runs, 70 RBI’s, with
.310 average. He also hit .387 
with runners in scoring posi­
tion which was crucial in the 
Braves’ march to the World 
Championship. This year, play­
ing full time and hitting in be­
tween Fred McGriff and Javy 
Lopez, look for superstar-type 
numbers and an MVP award in 
the trophy case.
National League Cy Young
— Tom Glavine, Atlanta Braves; 
that’s right ... the name was 
“Glavine” not Maddux. For once 
in a century, the great one will 
return to planet Earth and allow 
his unheralded counterpart to 
share the limelight. Glavine has 
been the glue of this team ever 
since their initial rise to domi­
nance, and Maddux or no 
Maddux, he has always been a 
“red light” player. Although he 
won the 1991 Cy Young, it was 
not until his clutch performance 
in the 1995 World Series that he 
earned the national respect he 
long deserved. Look for him to be 
the Braves’ leader this year and 
earn a second Cy Young.
N.L. Rookie of the Year —
Paul Wilson, New York Mets; 
we’ve all heard about the her-
you’ve asked for it 
it’s coming - 
look for it
aided new Mets’ hurlers... 
Isringhausen, Pulsipher, etc. 
Wait ’till you see this guy though 
— his stuff is better than all of 
theirs. Not only is Wilson one of 
those “can’t miss” prospects, but 
barring major injury he will 
quickly rise to the top of the 
major league pitching ranks. His 
197 K’s in 186 innings in the 
minors last year are only a taste 
of what is to come.
N.L. Manager of the Year
—Terry Collins, Houston Astros; 
this will be the year that Jeff 
Bagwell does NOT get hit on the 
wrist, and as a result the Astros 
will realize their underutilized 
potential and race to the top of 
the National League Central di­
vision. Collins was an astute stu­
dent of the game’s 
top manager 
(Jimmy 
Leyland), 
and
Gabrien Symons/
Tartan Art Editor
he finally has the talent (pitch­
ing, defense and offense) to put 
those skills to work.
N.L. General Manager of 
the Year — Fred Claire, Los 
Angeles Dodgers; with the off­
season trades and free agent 
signings which brought the likes 
of Mike Blowers and Greg Gagne 
to Dodgertown, Tommy’s team 
is ready to -avenge their four- 
game sweep in last year’s divi­
sional playoffs. The difference 
this year will be the key late- 
season additions made by Claire 
to finally separate the Dodgers 
from the testy Rockies and Pa­
dres. Such moves may include 
adding left-hander Jeff Fassero.
N.L. Comeback Player of 
the Year — Lenny Dykstra, 
Philadelphia Phillies; after a
year in which he was on the 
disabled list twice and hit only 
.264 with two home runs and 18 
RBIs, Dykstra is feeling healthy 
again and is ready to agitate 
National League pitchers for at 
least another year. Though he 
has lost a step, he has baseball 
smarts that relatively few play­
ers have nowadays, and that 
will only benefit him.
And now for the junior circuit:
A.L. Most Valuable Player
—Jim Edmonds, CaliforniaAn- 
gels; although Edmonds didn’t 
heat up until late May, the num­
bers he accumulated by the end 
of the year were for real (33 
home runs, 107 RBI’s, 120 runs 
scored, .290 BA). With a full 
year under his belt, and a reas­
suring playing environment 
with the Disney sale done, 
Edmonds is ready to step into
the national limelight and 
earn honors which will 
place him among 
baseball’s best.
A.L. Cy Young 
Award — Mike 
Mussina, Baltimore 
Orioles; Mussina has 
consistently been one 
ofthe games’ premier 
starters over the past 
few years. Now, with 
the hoopla of the streak 
over, the addition of
Roberto Alomar in the infield, 
and the addition ofthe best man­
ager in the American League, 
the O’s are ready to step to the 
front of the AL East and 
Mussina will lead them 
there. Look for him to add 
to his numbers (19 wins, 
3.29 ERA, 158 K’s in 221 
innings pitched) from last year.
A.L. Rookie of the Year — 
Russ Davis, Seattle Mariners; 
in order for the Mariners to come 
close to returning to the glory of 
last year, the left side of the 
infield (Davis and rookie Alex 
Rodriguez) will have to produce. 
Davis has been putting up big 
numbers in Columbus for years 
but was always stuck behind 
Wade Boggs in New York. His 
time has come to shine.
A.L. Manager of the Year 
— Davey Johnson, Baltimore 
Orioles; this one is almost a no- 
brainer. Johnson has already 
proven his genius in the Na­
tional League with the Mets and 
Reds, and it is a wonder why he 
can’t hold a constant job. Should 
the O’s come close to what their

The Alley Oop
by Chris Cannon
As the 1995-1996 NBA regular 
season draws to a close, the Chi­
cago Bulls have all but assured 
then’ place in the playoffs and his­
tory. But while it seems that play­
off pressure is all on Chicago, the 
other teams around the league have 
a lot more to worry about.
In the East, Miami is winning a 
race with Charlotte for the eighth 
playoff spot and the right to be 
trampled by the Bulls. Both of 
Chicago’s potential foes shuffled 
their lineups this season with two 
major trades. Neither one has the 
experience or firepower to mess 
with the best.
Cleveland, Atlanta, and Detroit 
are rebuilding teams ahead of 
schedule, while Indiana arid New 
York are experienced teams on the 
decline. All five teams are within
three games of each other. The 
club with the worst record will 
have to meet Orlando, while 
the other four match up in the 
first round.
The Orlando Magic has 
troubles of its own. They’ve been 
playing without center Shaquille 
O’Neal, who is mourning a death 
in the family, and guard Penny 
Hardaway was ejected from a 
game last week. More impor­
tantly, the home court dominance 
that they worked so hard to es­
tablish has quickly faded. After 
winning their first 33 home 
games, they have lost three of 
their last four.
Out West, the matchups prom­
ise to be more interesting. For 
the past two seasons, the Hous­
ton Rockets have rebounded from 
mediocre regular seasons to win 
the championship. They seem to 
have set up another comeback by 
playing and losing without in­
jured stars Hakeem Olajuwon, 
Clyde Drexler, and Robert Horry. 
But this year, the L.A. Lakers 
have the comeback kid in Magic 
Johnson. When the Rockets meet 
the Lakers in the first round, 
fireworks will fly.
Highly-seeded teams San An­
tonio and Utah are slumping. 
The two teams also typically per­
form worse in the playoffs. They 
will play some combination of 
the surging Portland Trailblaz- 
ers and Phoenix Suns. First-, 
round series run to a maximum 
of five three-game series, so ex-, 
pect at least one upset out West.:
For the third year in a row, the’ 
Seattle Sonics are the best in 
the west and will face a team 
with a losing record in the first 
round. But they haven’t made it 
out of the first round since three 
years ago, when they came- 
within one game of reaching the 
NBA finals. The question out- 
West is “which Sonic squad will 
show up?” Even worse news for 
Seattle fans, if they make it to 
the second round, they play the 
Rockets/Lakers winner.
Prediction: In the East, the 
Bulls are everyone’s favorite. 
Mine too. The West is a mess, 
which is fun. I like whoever winsr, 
the Lakers/Rockets series. In the 
finals: Da Bulls.

School record-holders go to Nationals
By PAUL BOOTHE
Voluom e81lut Aa,u1l
Seniors Geoff Waller and Matt Moe represented 
the Tartan men’s swim team in the NCAA Division 
III Men’s Swimming Championships on March 
21-23 at Emory University.
Waller finished seventh in the 200-yard butter­
fly in 1:53.40, qualifying for All-American status, 
his fifth honor. He also placed 19th in the 500-yard 
freestyle in 4:42.8, a personal best. Moe placed 
17th in the 500-yard freestyle in 4:42.11, also a 
personal best. As the top 16 finishers qualify as All- 
Americans, Moe was .05 seconds out of 16th place. 
Moe is already a three-time All-American. He also 
placed 21st in the 400-yard IM in 4:11.02.
Coach Jim Cutrone was very pleased with his 
swimmers’ performances and said, “Competing all 
four years at the level they have is not easy ... 
Overall, seniors are the smallest class represented 
as a group [at Nationals].”
classified
This was the third appearance at Nationals for 
both swimmers. Cutrone said that both provided 
leadership to the team and acted as captains.
Cutrone said that Waller’s success has come 
from him being such a fierce competitor over the 
four years he’s been on the squad. Waller gradu­
ates holding school records in the 200- and 400- 
yard IM, as well as the 200-yard butterfly. He is 
also a five-time UAA champion.
According to Cutrone, consistent hard training 
and hard work is what drove Moe to the top. Moe 
holds the school record in the 200-yard breast­
stroke, and the UAA conference record in the 400- 
yard IM. Moe is a four-time UAA champion.
Moe was not entirely happy with his finish; his, 
times have remained fairly consistent over the last 
three years at Nationals. However, he says that 
while he has remained constant, the race has 
gotten much faster — his time which earned him1 
fourth place two years ago in the 500 yard freestyle 
earned him this year’s 17th place finish.

Volume 90, Issue 21The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania8 April 1996CMU baseball club steps to the plate j
By PAUL BOOTHE
Voluom e81lut Aa,u1l
The Carnegie Mellon baseball club 
began their season this week, starting 
off strongly but losing steam later in 
the week to finish with a 2-4 record.
The team traveled to Westmoreland 
County Community College on March 
30 for their season opener and came 
back with a 3-1 win. The Tartans led 
off the scoring in the first inning, as 
freshman outfielder Link Brown 
singled. Brown then moved into scor­
ing position by stealing second base. He 
was driven home by senior co-captain 
Mike Monico’s single. Westmoreland 
scored a run of its own in the second, 
but CMU retook the lead in the third 
inning when, after loading the bases, 
sophomore Joe Kovacocy was walked, 
bringing in sophomore J ay McCormack, 
who had singled to get on base. Later 
that same inning, grad student Rich 
Seder hit a sacrifice fly ball that brought 
in Brown, who had also been walked. 
The team then held off Westmoreland’s 
attempts to even the score through­
out the remainder of the game to 
claim the victory.
Senior righthanded pitcher Matt 
Beam had a fantastic game. West­
moreland managed to get only four hits 
off Beam, who struck out seven batters 
while walking only two. Coach Scott 
Smith said, “We hadn’t planned on go­
ing seven with any pitcher this early, 
but Matt was really in command the 
whole game and actually got better as 
the game went along.” Monico and 
Brown led the hitting for the team, 
tallying two apiece.
Unfortunately, CMU’s great play did 
not carry over into the second game of 
the doubleheader afternoon. West­
moreland came out looking for revenge 
and got it, defeating the Tartans 8-0. 
McCormack pitched the loss, going over 
four innings. The squad was plagued 
by seven errors and had trouble in the 
batter’s box, as only Monico, Brown, 
and seniors Dave Hines and Tom 
O’Farrell managed to connect.
The Tartans split a second double- 
header the following day at Commu­
nity College of Allegheny County’s 
Boyce Campus. In the first game, the 
Tartans led off strong, as Monico’s 
double allowed two runs to score in the 
first. However, when the team took to 
the field, they saw their lead disappear 
under the heels of CCAC Boyce’s five- 
run streak, helped along by two Tartan 
errors. In the fourth, the CMU squad 
came back, narrowing CCAC Boyce’s 
lead to 6-4 with hits by sophomore
Brian White, Beam, and Kovacocy. 
These hits represented the only other 
runs that they would see for the game, 
as CCAC Boyce coasted to defeat the 
Tartans, 8-4.
In the second game against CCAC 
Boyce, the Tartans took command early- 
and never looked back. They hit home 
six runs in the first and didn’t let up the 
pressure all game to win it 8-1. CMU 
had 13 hits, with two each by Monico, 
O’Farrell, Seder, Beam, and freshman 
Jon Mayes, who also had three RBI’s. 
Junior lefty Scott Kepp was the win­
ning pitcher. He pitched six innings, 
striking out 11 batters while giving up 
only two hits. Kepp had two RBI’s of his 
own to add to the Tartan scoring.
The Tartans hit a wall on April 2 
when they hit the road to play 
Westminster College. The Westminster 
team played without mercy, smashing 
the CMU team 19-1. The Tartans per­
formed poorly in the field, and their 
only run came off a second-inning home 
run by grad student lefthanded pitcher 
Steve Lopez. Lopez, the starting pitcher, 
picked off three runners in the first two 
innings, while Monico tallied a single 
and a double for the statistics.
The final game was on April 3, against 
a strong Penn State-New Kensington 
squad. Behind 7-0, the team put away 
four runs in the seventh, but Penn 
State buried them for a 10-6 loss. Jun­
ior catcher Joe Smarrelli had three hits 
and two RBI’s, while O’Farrell hit two 
doubles and two RBI’s.
Team manager Adam Vincent was 
optimistic about the season. He said, “I 
think we have a really good shot at 
making at least .500.” He believes that 
the team started off slowly because the 
team is not used to playing on an actual 
field — because CMU has no baseball

rusty... [they] had trouble handling the 
hops that happen on grass.” According 
to Vincent, if the field would have been 
ready, they should have swept all ofthe 
first four matches. He was not, how­
ever, surprised at the outcome of the 
Westminster game, because they are a 
Division I team with a good reputation, j 
He was also looking forward to this 
Friday’s matchup against Geneva 
College at Three Rivers Stadium. “It j 
should be a good game... I think we’re ; 
going to win.”
The CMU team will rematch against 
Westmoreland away today, followed by j 
Community College of Beaver County ;

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s lacrosse team is set 
to begin its season. The team, 
which is a combination of play­
ers from CMU and University 
of Pittsburgh, is ready to pick 
up where it left off last sea­
son, when they went 9—1 in 
the division.
The team competes in the 
WCLL, which includes 20 
teams from Wisconsin to New 
York, notably Ohio State Uni­
versity, Grove City College, 
Notre Dame, West Virginia 
University, Wheeling, and 
Davis and Elkins. The team 
lost the championship game 
last year, but they are ready to 
get their due. They were the 
highest scoring team in the divi­
sion last year, and were aided by 
the goaltending efforts of CMU 
sophomore Jessica Strelitz.
To qualify for the post-sea­
son this year, the team must 
play all the teams in their 
division, plus two games. 
Their season this year has 
been rather frustrating be­
cause their first four games 
were canceled because the 
other teams were not prepared.

Over spring break they 
played in a tourney at Michi­
gan State University. They 
were defending the title, after 
winning the tournament last 
season. The three-day tourney 
featured University of Chicago, 
Chicago Women’s Lacrosse 
Club, Purdue, University of 
Ohio, Michigan State, and 
Notre Dame.
They lost to Ohio University 
4—3, edged out Indiana Univer­
sity of Pennsylvania 7-6 in the 
next game, and was defeated 
by University of Michigan, 7- 
3. CMU junior Astrid Rapp and 
Strelitz have both been playing 
very well.
This Saturday, the lacrosse 
team will be hosting a New 
York tournament with SUNY 
schools and Canisius at Pitt’s 
Cost Center. As a fund raiser, 
they will also be holding a high 
school clinic before the round- 
robin tournament.
Anyone is welcome to join the 
team’s practices. Practices are 
held at the Cost Center on Tues­

The men’s and women’s ten­
nis teams have started their 
spring season with high opti­
mism for success. On Saturday, 
the men’s team placed second 
in a tournament held at Erie. 
Both teams trained in Hilton 
Head, S.C. during spring break 
for preparation of the upcom­
ing season.
The spring season is critical 
for both teams, because the com­
petition is harder and the UAA’s 
are held in the spring. The fall 
season is perceived by the team 
as preparation for the more 
strenuous spring season. Play­
ers feel that this year’s teams 
are some of the strongest ever 
at CMU and have high expecta­
tions for themselves.
Women’s team captain 
Miriam Huang said, “This is 
the strongest team, men’s and 
women’s, that I’ve ever been on, 
so there is potential for suc­
cess.” Senior Murali Horan 
added, “If the team stays 
healthy [for the UAA’s], then 
everything will be fine.” The 
teams feel that they have the 
ability to place among the top 
five teams in the UAA’s because 
the talent level is high and the 
players work together.
Although the men’s team lost 
a tough match to rival Allegh­
eny College in the Erie Tourna 
ment, they had a 
strong start by 
placing sec­
ond overall.

nament
of
rounds, 
and the 
team played Al­
legheny in the fi­
nal round.
Before the trip to 
South Carolina, the 
women’s team lost to 
Oberlin College.
However, they feel 
that they have im­
proved 
then.
The Hilton 
Head trip 
gave both 
teams expe­
rience and 
stamina for 
the spring 
season.
Freshman 
Jillian Watkins said 
that players had 
several matches 
during the week, 
which were impor­
tant in helping the 
team prepare for 
the difficult 
matches in the
next few weeks. Huang added 
that the training also helped 
foster cooperation between 
both teams. By playing 
tougher competi­
tion in Hilton 
Head, the 
teams feel that
Gabrien Symons/Tartan Art Editor
they are better prepared for the 
UAA’s. Spring training was also 
important because it gives more 
experience to the freshmen on 
both teams who play critical 
roles in the top positions.
The teams had the opportu­
nity during the off-season to 
train on the University of 
Pittsburgh’s 
indoor 
courts. 
Although 
some of the 
players felt 
that the 
playing turf 
was slower 
compared to 
most courts, 
many felt that it 
was a beneficial 
opportunity 
since there 
have been few 
training op­
portunities in 
the past during 
the off-season. 
The women’s 
team plays today at 
home against Al­
legheny College. 
Both the men’s and 
women’s teams will 
play at Gettysburg 
next weekend, fol­
lowed by a home 
match against Pitt on

On Saturday, Carnegie Mellon 
hosted the CMU Invitational. Unlike 
many other track meets in which CMU 
will compete this year, no team scores 
were kept; everything was individual. 
But according to coach 
Gary Meckley, the CMU 
men’s team performed 
well. “We felt that our 
guys did very well. They 
were dominant in certain 
events.”
Certainly one of those 
events was the 3,000- 
meter steeplechase. Led 
by freshman Kristo 
Kreichbaum’s time of 
9:46.68, CMU grabbed 
the first four places in 
the event. Juniors Ron 
Polcawich, Paul Hatala, 
and Greg Stults rounded 
out the top four. “If he 
had been legitimately 
challenged, he might 
have run six or seven sec­
onds faster. He missed 
qualifying for the nation­
als by one second,” said 
Meckley.
In the 5,000-meter run, 
senior Sebastian Ziesler 
and freshman Josh 
Donner of CMU finished 
first and second with 
times ofl5:49.28 and 
15:52.40, respectively.
“It did my heart good that 
in the 5,000-meters, we 
finished one-two, ahead 
of two runners from 
Duquesne in the stand­
ings,” Meckley said.
Surprising Meckley 
were the outcomes of the 
4x400-meter relay and 
the p61e vault. “Our 
4x400 B team almost 
beat our A team and they 
finished one-two. I had 
given the sprinters a 
hard workout the week 
before and for them to do 
that well was great.”
In the pole vault, 
sophomore Rick Rikoski finished third 
with a vault of 13'6". “Last year, he 
had a hard time making 10 feet,” said 
Meckley.
Other strong finishes for the CMU 
men were the first place finish of fresh­
man Chris Louks in the 800-meter 
with sophomore Malik Washington in
third, sophomore Peter Hunt finish- eight meters farther than her closest 
ing in a tie for second place in the high competitor and far enough to gain an 
jump by jumping 6'2", and senior E.J. automatic bid to the NCAA Division 
Tsangaris finishing fourth in the dis- III Championships at North Central 
cus with a throw of 40.43 meters. College near Chicago in late May.
The meet also went well for the In addition to that, she placed sec- 
women, according to women’s coach ond in the discus with a toss of 34.02 
Dario Donatelli. “I’m happy with the meters. Baustert, who was sixth in the
nation in 1,500-meters in­
doors, won the 1,500- 
meter run in 4:57.49. Fif­
teen minutes later, she 
came back and finished 
second in the 3,000-meter 
run with a time of 
10:22.77.
While Donatelli was 
happy with the meet for 
the most part, the one dis- 
appointment was the 
4xl00-meter relay. CMU 
had been hit by some in­
juries and some shuffling 
had occurred in the 
lineup. On one day’s prac­
tice, Carnegie Mellon 
opened up a lead.
However, the team’s 
lack of practice time 
showed up on the ex­
change between the sec­
ond leg runner and the 
third as the baton was 
dropped, disqualifying the 
relay team from that 
event. “[The 4x100] is one 
of those events that you 
need to practice so that 
the kids get familiar with 
each other,” Donatelli 
said. “We were definitely 
in the lead.”
According to Donatelli, 
“We were hoping to get 
some nice weather as [the 
current weather] hampers 
the sprinters and the 
jumpers, but besides the 
relay, the other kids are 
really coming along quite 
well.”
Donatelli also got strong 
performances from jun­
iors Leslie Brown, plac­
ing fourth in the discus 
with a throw of 33.34 
meters, and Vonquitra 
Bebee who finished third 
in the 100-meters in 13.37 seconds 
and fifth in the 200-meters with a time 
of 27.49 seconds. Also, freshmen 
Maureen McGranahan, Margaret Pow­
ers, and Melissa Lott finished third, 
fourth and fifth in the 1,500-meter 
run, giving CMU four finishers in the 
top five in that event.
The Tartan 4x400-meter relay squads ran extremely well in the 
Invitational. CMU’s B team nearly overtook the A team, and together 
they claimed the top two spots in the event.
results. We had some extremely good 
performances even with the weather 
we’ve been having.”
Perhaps the best performances of 
the day were those of junior Penny 
Summerville and senior Melissa 
Baustert. Summerville won the jav­
elin with a throw of 43.44 meters,

Imagine you are speeding down the high­
way. The windows are rolled down and the 
music is turned all the way up. The possi­
bilities are limitless. Miles and miles of 
roads ahead and you have a full tank of 
gas. You have embarked on the adventure 
of a lifetime — you are on a road trip. 
Nobody can stop you now (except maybe 
those flashing lights in your rear view 
mirror).
Road trips are popular everywhere, but 
they particularly appeal to college stu­
dents. The thrill of adventure, the sense of 
absolute freedom, and the opportunity to 
get away from the pressures of schoolwork 
help make road trips popular with CMU 
students.
Each weekend, students hit the road for 
destinations both near and far. The most 
common weekend destinations are the 
nearby cities of New York, Philadelphia, 
and Washington D. Cwhich get their p opu- 
larity not only from their relative proxim­
ity, but also because of the large number of 
students who originate from these cities. 
Road trips that do not lead home usually 
lead to other universities. Visiting friends 
and checking out the social scene at an­
other college for the weekend is almost 
always fun, or at least an interesting alter­
native to spending another weekend in 
Pittsburgh.
Unless you happen to find yourself par­
ticularly entertaining and an excellent

Mountain Dew is your friend. Don’t hit 
the road without it. On a trip from Pitts­
burgh to Philadelphia last year, I found 
myself inches away from a tractor-trailer 
as my car swerved out of control while I 
was sleeping. Buggered out of my skull, I 
pulled off to the next rest stop, ingested an 
entire liter of Mountain Dew, and made it 
the rest of the trip wide awake. Falling 
asleep during a road trip can be a very bad 
experience as it very well may be your last; 
therefore, always have something loaded 
with caffeine by your side.
More recently, I headed out west with 
two Mountain Dew “Quick Slams” within 
reach and a passenger to help keep me 
awake. The journey was a seven to eight 
hour drive through miles and miles of 
midwest farmland. This means: bring a 
camera. We didn’t have one on the way 
out, but upon .reaching our destination, 
my companion and I bought one of those 
little disposable doohickies so that we could 
take pictures of all the funny things we 
saw on the way west. No one’s going to 
believe you when you say you drove through 
“Licking County” unless you have proof. 
Also, the odds of finding billboards for five 
different RV companies within one mile of 
the roadway are pretty slim. You’re going 
to want some documentation.
A theme song is also vital. When travel­
ing with a group, one of the more exciting
L---------------------------------------------.
things to do while boring down 300 miles of 
highway is to constantly search radio sta­
tions for the same song. You’re not going to 
want Beethoven’s ninth for this one. In­
stead, look for something modern, popu­
lar, cheesy, and with easy to understand 
lyrics so everyone can sing along. On my 
last excursion, we picked the “Peaches” 
song by those Presidents guys. Every time 
it came on the radio, I sang and clapped 
along while my passenger checked to see if 
he could actually jump from the car and 
still survive. Personally, I’m quite fond of 
the song, and now whenever I hear it, I get 
to think back to the road trip with fond 
memories.
If you spend a lot of time singing, you just 
might work up an appetite, but picking a 
place to eat has to be done carefully. For 
one thing, no Taco Bell!!! Come on people, 
you’re getting back into a car. McDonald’s 
is always a safe bet, and it was the dining 
establishment of choice on my last trip. 
Pretty much anywhere in the country (in­
cluding Tasmania —• a place where you 
have to be careful of random cattle clog­
ging the highways) McDonald’s will offer 
the same meal at the same price. It’s kind 
of like an old friend, one you’re not too fond 
of, but glad to see when there’s no one else 
around who you recognize.
Fuel is something that can’t really be 
helped. It’s expensive, but it helps make 
the car go. If you are really low on money, 
use Taco Bell as a last resort. The gas is 
much cheaper there.

Anti-depressants offer relief where psychotherapy fails
By TRICIA DAVIS
Voluom euo990l,uIl
Searching for allieviation from 
the symtoms of depression can be 
a tricky process, especially with 
the various anti-depressant drugs 
that are now available to just 
about anyone, depending on the 
severity of the illness.
In many cases, a person recov­
ers from depression after sessions 
of psychotherapy. Sometimes, 
however, talking with a doctor 
isn’t enough and the psychiatrist 
may prescribe an antidepressant 
drug. An antidepressant is usu­
ally prescribed in circumstances 
where therapy doesn’t work or if 
the doctor suspects the depres­
sion is being caused by a bio­
chemical imbalance.
The choice of medication will 
depend on the particular form of 
depression a person has and his 
or her medical history. Individu­
als can respond very differently 
to antidepressants, so it is impor­
tant that patients hilly under­
stand how the drug might affect 
you and your lifestyle. For many 
patients, psychotherapy is nec­
essary in addition to medication, 
to help deal with psychological 
problems associated with their 
illness. It is important to be re­
evaluated by a doctor regularly 
until recovery is complete, since 
not everyone responds the same 
to each therapy.
Are antidepressant drugs ef­
fective? Many effective drugs are 
available, but the success will 
depend on each individual. One 
thing to keep in mind, even 
though many of the anti-depres­
sant drugs are non-addicting, 
patients often feel dependent on 
the drug and feel unable to func­
tion without it. Also, the side 
effects differ for each medication.
Tricyclic antidepressant 
(TCAs) such as Elavil increase 
levels of norepinephrine and se­
rotonin the brain. These drugs 
may also cause drowsiness, dry 
mouth, blurred vision, urinary 
retention, rapid heart rate, and 
hypertension.
Another group of drugs—the 
selective serotonin re-uptake in­
hibitors (SSRIs) such as Prozac— 
relieve depression as well. Prozac 
relieves depression in 60 to 70 
percent of those who try it, and 
has fewer harmful side effects 
than any other drug: It is less 
toxic than other antidepressants 
and thus harder to overdose on; 
and, it isn’t considered addictive. 
Some of the side effects of Prozac 
include: agitation, dizziness, 
weight loss, dry mouth, diarrhea, 
and infrequently impotence, sei­
zures and inability to achieve or­
gasm. There have been some 
rare cases in which some patients 
taking Prozac developed suicidal 
tendencies; however, psychia­
trists believe Prozac to be safe 
and effective when given under 
close supervision.
Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is an­
other antidepressant drug; it is 
usually reserved for those who 
have difficulty with SSRIs. 
Bupropion may cause mild dizzi­
ness, nausea, agitation, and in­
somnia.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOIs) affect many neurotrans­
mitters and cause many serious 
side-effects, as a result are usu­
ally the last choice of doctors.
Once prescribed, the drug may 
work, but the effectiveness of a 
drug depends on the individual 
person. The drug may make a 
person feel better, but often not 
for 10 days to two weeks. The 
initial phase of such a drug is the 
most dangerous because it may 
give the person the energy to act 
on suicide before it improves his 
or her mood.
To be sure that you receive the 
best treatment, make certain that 
the psychiatrist you choose is af­
filiated with a good hospital. You 
should feel comfortable with your 
doctor and trust your instincts. If 
your doctor prescribes antidepres­
sant drugs before asking you to 
participate in psychotherapy, 
then you should probably go to a 
different doctor.

these symptoms have many people wondering anxiety and a sense of “directionlessness,” “Henry” 
if they are suffering from a clinical case of found that depresssion wasn’t a condition that he
depression. Luckily, the Center is available 
daily for anyone who might find themselves in 
this situation.
“Feeling sad or grumpy is a normal feeling. 
But when it gets to the point that you can’t 
function, you may have a problem.” Kryder 
said. She explained a series of depression warn­
ing signs: feelings of worthlessness or self- 
reporach, a tendency to sleep too little or much, 
a lack of concentration and focus, and an ex­
tremely increased or descreased appetite. While 
these classical signs are things to look out for, 
the main thing, says
Kryder, is to “be aware if ____________________
you feel the internal expe­
riences that you have is 
just not tolerable.” In other 
words, if the problems of 
life weigh to heavily or of­
ten, Kryder suggests get­
ting some help.
“If a person suffers from 
two or more of the symp­
toms mentioned,” said 
Kryder, “it is important to 
contact a coulselor. Counselors are available 
every day. But if you feel you can’t come to the 
Center, you can also speak to an RA, the resi­
dence life people, or Health Services. There are 
many routes to intervention.”
If a student wishes to talk to someone and 
doesn’t want to go to a counselor, there are 
always other staff-members willing to help. 
“We don’t give advice and we’re not therapists,” 
said Michele Vollmar, a junior CA and english 
major. Vollmar has interacted with many resi­
dents who have experienced depression and 
explained that RAs and CAs “talk to people to 
get a sense of where they are and to flesh out 
their feelings. More often than not we make a 
referral to the Center.”
RAs have training in reflec­
tive listening skills and gen­
eral knowledge on how 
to help people in dire 
straits. However, 
the students are 
always re­
minded that 
there are 
more quali­
fied source 
available.
“If it’s 
someone 
having 
trouble 
with 
their 
b o y - 
friend,” 
said 
Vollmar,
“we talk 
through 
it. But if 
it’s some- 
t h i n 
pretty ma­
jor we al­
ways make a 
referral.”
One student,
“Henry,” who 
wished to remain 
anonymous, found that 
the Counseling Center 
played an important role in 
his getting back on his feet after 
depression hit home. “I started going [to 
the Counseling Center] at the beginning of my 
sophomore year in 1993,” he said. “Many of my 
friends, some professors, the dean — they told 
ip me to go and it was a really good decision.” 
g “Henry” found that his depression grew to 
Unmanageable proportions after starting col­
lege due to the pressures of school and living 
away from home. “I had problems with drugs 
and alcohol, mainly marijuana, and I made 
myself believe that once I stopped using, I’d be
could pinpoint. “I think it’s important to remem­
ber that it’s not an isolated thing. As things would 
occur, I would stop functioning,” he said.
What separated “Henry” from others who suf­
fer from daily battles such as social problems and 
bad grades was his viscious cycle of failure that 
impeded his ability to move on.
“It eats at you and you sit in a room by yourself. 
You realize that things are too handle for you to 
handle, but “it” is such a vague thing,” he said. 
‘That’s the difficulty, not knowing how to define 
your problem.” •
/ think it’s important to remember 
that [depression is] not an isolated 
thing. As things would occur, I would 
stop functioning
—“Henry, ” an anonymous student
“Henry” also says that lonliness is a factor that 
causes college students to become depressed, “it 
becomes a self-esteem thing,” he said. “I wasn’t 
sure of how to interact with other people. Having 
to deal with your sexuality is difficult at this 
time.”
“Henry” noticed a cycle of drinking until his 
grades dropped and then drinking &IwoCtI his 
grades dropped, a dangerous situation that tends 
to lead to a sense of hopelessness.
If you are concerned, according the Kryder, but 
feel “you can look past the pain of what’s happen­
ing today,” you may not be depressed but instead 
should just talk to a close friend or faculty mem­
ber. “Seek help,” said Kryder. “Exercise,, eat well, 
and stay away from alchohol. This is espe-. 
dally pertinent with Carnival 
coming up.”
If the situation is rela­
tively bearable, some 
suggestions from the 
Counseling Center 
focus around self- 
awareness and 
help. Some tac­
tics include 
taking a 
break, exer- 
c i s i n g , 
avoiding 
stressors, 
avoiding 
extreme 
or long­
term de­
cisions or 
commit- 
m e n t s , 
and, fi­
nally, see­
ing a physi­
cian is a fi­
nal step if all 
else fails. 
While rates 
of depression at 
CMU are not 
higher than the 
normal rate given 
the student popula­
tion, the chance still ex­
ists that some problems and 
struggles might prove too much 
for some students. Everything 
from counseling to anti-depressant medica­
tions are available on campus, and these facilities 
may mean the difference between pain or comfort 
for some students. Kryder and Vollmar empha­
size that there is always help available, and that 
it is of the utmost importance to find it before the 
problem grows to deep.

“It was a really good experi­
ence. I’m a sexual assault advi­
sor, so I wanted to be available 
because it’s a really emotional 
thing,” said Elizabeth Irvine, a 
sophomore Bachelor of the Hu­
manities and Arts major, in art 
and history. Irvine was one of 
the many men and women who 
attended last Tuesday’s Take 
ack the Night demonstration 
and march.
The march, which started on 
the steps of Warner Hall was 
held in honor of survivors of 
violent sex crimes. An annual 
event, the demonstration in­
cluded members of the CMU 
community, as well as those 
from Unviersity of Pittsburgh 
and Chatham College.
Although the heart of the 
event was to protest and dem­
onstrate against rape and sex 
crimes, the march was also to 
speak out against violence of all 
kinds, according to Kathy Frey, 
a senior communication design 
student, and participant in the 
inarch. Women and men alike 
joined forces in the march.
Beginning with speeches from 
different organizations, such as 
the Women’s Center and Pitt’s 
Campus Women’s Organiza­
tion, the inspired demonstra­
tors then proceeded through the 
streets of Oakland to the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh’s William

this shit no more. Five- 
six-seven-eight, no more 
hatred, no more rape!”
Another chant the crowd 
recited as they marched, 
“Whatever we wear, wher­
ever we go, Yes means yes 
and No means no,” showed 
their determination to re­
claim the streets for all 
victims of rape.
“Our crowd grew larger 
along the route as people 
hopped out of cars to join, 
and people cheered us on 
from their apartment win­
dows and honked their 
horns in support,” said 
Frey.
The crowd, carried signs 
to further get their point 
across. Some Pitt demon­
strators carried a banner 
ofT-shirts, strung together 
and painted to commemo­
rate specific violent acts 
and the survivors.
“It was a really support­
ive crowd and everyone 
had really positive atti­
tudes,” said Irvine.
The march culminated 
at the William Pitt Union 
on the Pitt campus, where sev­
eral speakers told their stories 
of violent crimes. The
members of several 
CMU affiliated orga­
nizations. Many 
survivors of violent 
and sex crimes told 
of their personal ex­
periences, some for 
the first time. Men 
and Women alike, 
including a young 
woman in the sev­
enth grade, inspired 
the crowd with their 
courage, and got 
their message of 
awareness across.
The “open mike” at 
the end of the march 
allowed any partici­
pants to tell of their 
experiences or the 
experiences of some­
one close to them.
“People of all ages 
spoke, from a 13- 
year-old girl to a 
[sic.] women in their 
40s. Quite a few men 
were rallying as 
well,” explained 
Frey, “and they 
spoke out and 
shared stories as 
lent Crimes, the Pittsburgh well. Some members of Pitt read 
Action Against Rape, poems, too. There was a lot of 
theUnivesity fo Pittsburgh and cheering, hugging, and support,

speakerswere representatives 
of various organizations such 
as the Center for Victims of Vio-
in general.”
The demonstration also in­
cluded a wire fence, upon which 
participants tied white ribbons 
to commemorate victims of vio­
lent crimes, both living and de­
ceased, as an illustrative sym­
bol of what the participants 
were demonstrating for, accord­
ing to Frey.
The Take Back the Night 
march is an annual event held 
nationwide in April. As the 
voices of the empowered ac­
claimed in the streets of Oak­
land, the march seemed to mo­
tivate the participants and the 
on-lookers; “People unite. Take 
Back the Night!”
A fence with ribbons tied on 
to in memory of victims of vio­
lent crimeswill be on display 
the next week, with additional 
ribbons for others to participate.

Hard drives lack bookmarks
PULP FREE
By Eric Salzman
Doing some nifty on-line re­
search in the library the other 
day reminded me of a presen­
tation I gave back in high 
school. I told some sort of li­
brary group from South Jer­
sey about how the wonders of 
the Internet would one day 
allow students to download 
i1&c P,wp right onto 
their computers.
They’d never even 
have to get the book.
Thinking about it a 
few years later, I re­
alize that getting 
Moby Dick onto my 
computer would not 
really be anything to 
brag about because 
the book sucks no 
matter what form it 
comes in. Well, it does.
More importantly 
though, what would I 
use for a bookmark?
I’m thinking that if 
anyone ever decides to 
use a computer to read 
a book, that person is 
totally screwed. You 
can only download a 
book if you plan on 
reading it all in one sitting. 
See, if you have a real book — 
these things are numerous 
sheets of paper bound to­
gether, often with words here 
and there — any time you want 
to take a break, you just stick 
a little doohickey in between 
the pages you leave off on. This 
way, you know just where to 
resume reading.
Now, I may be able to polish
off a novella or a short story in 
one shot, NCu i1&c P,wp6 no way! 
So, imagine that I get by the 
clam chowder or even that god 
awful chapter on whale blubber 
(I hate the whale blubber chap­
ter), and want to take a break. 
I can’t very well stick a 
doohickey into my hard drive 
and save my place, now can I? 
No siree — I sure can’t. If you 
stop reading at any point, you’ll 
just have to start from the be­
ginning again next time because 
you won’t know where you 
stopped the last time. This 
means reading about clam 
chowder over and over again — 
yuck. There are other problems
Elizabeth Neuman/Tartan Production Manager
about reading books on com­
puters. Imagine this scenario: 
it’s Sunday morning. You just 
had a huge bowl of “Bran 
Flakes.” The night before you 
feasted at the Corner Oven. You 
know what it’s time for now. Oh 
yes, baby, and you’re going to 
want some reading material. 
This is going to be a doosie, so 
you’ll be wanting i1&c P,wpd 
Well, if you are doomed to a
computer, you will be sitting 
on the pot with no literature. 
That is of course, unless you 
have a lap top, but then you’ll 
have to be real careful.
Also, say you get really mad 
at someone. Unless you’re 
reading from a real book, you 
can’t throw what you’re read­
ing at the person. That is, of 
course, unless you have a 
laptop. And that would be an 
expensive vent.
Food — big one on here. You 
know how sometimes you’re 
eating cookies while reading a 
book, and then the next time 
you read some, there’s a little 
of the cookie left, so it’s like a 
nice little treat. Is that 
going to happen with 
a computer? I don’t 
think so.
When you find your 
couch is leaning a 
little too far in one di­
rection, you can’t re­
ally use your computer 
to balance it out, but 
i1&c P,wp is the per­
fect furniture fixer- 
upper doohickey. 
Truth is, it’s not so 
good for much else.
Finally, and this is 
a big one: sometimes, 
you read a book as 
lousy as i1&c P,wp, 
and you’re so mad 
when you’re finally 
done that you just 
want to burn the 
puppy up. This is 
where having bound sheets of 
paper comes in real handy. 
Not even a laptop is going to 
save you here.

CRACKING THE MYTH
By Suzanne Paddock
One of the biggest complaints 
people have against feminism 
is that it is a white, middle- 
class movement. While I do feel 
that this complaint is not with­
out some merit, I think that 
feminists are not the only ones 
to blame. To commemorate the 
25 anniversary of Stonewall, 
thousands of lesbians and gay 
men took over some of 
the major roads in New 
York City, but the press 
neglected to mention 
the demonstration 
even happened. So in 
many cases, the media 
only covers feminist 
demonstrations if 
white, middle-class 
women and men are the 
main participants.
Therefore, the media 
has censored the femi­
nist movement making 
it seems that only 
white women have ac- Students 
tively supported femi­
nism, which is not true.
As a student I have also par­
ticipated in demonstrations 
that have failed to be recog­
nized on campus . One of these 
events has been the many Take 
Back the Night marches held 
every April. This year Take 
Back the Night was held on 
April 2.
The Take Back the Night tra­
dition began 20 years ago and 
continues to be held across the 
nation in April. Take Back the 
Night was established to recog­
nize that sexual violence occurs 
and to honor the survivors. The 
most recent Take Back .the
Night recently held, began as their experience. For some 
usual, at the steps of Warner people, it was the first time they

or someone you know has been 
assaulted.
After the speakers, the march 
of about a 100 people began. 
Carrying signs and chanting 
such things as “Where ever we

go, whatever we wear, yes 
means yes and no means no” we 
proceeded to walk down 
Morewood to Fifth and from 
there up Bayard and down 
Dithridge and on to the William 
Pitt Union. When we reached 
the William Pitt Union we gath­
ered around and held “open 
mike” where anyone was free to 
speak their truth about their 
own experience or that some­
one they care for.
It is one thing to march 
around protesting our society’s 
epidemic of sexual and domes­
tic violence, quite another to 
hear survivors speak about
While open mike was going 
on, people who were either as­
saulted themselves or someone 
they knew was assaulted, tied 
white string to the wire fence to 
remember the survivors. The 
multitude of white ribbons thal 
people tied stand as 
visual reminder oj 
those whose voices anc 
stories we don’t hear. 
The Women’s Centei 
will be holding the

Starting April 15th we 
will be displaying the 
fence out on the cut anc

one to tie a ribbon oi

According to CMU 
no rapes have occurrec 
on this campus. Thii

Work explores Hispanic culture
By ANDREW WANG
Voluom euo990l,uIl
VIluCM,o is the Spanish word 
meaning a philosophic or social 
conversation or an evening party. 
Also, it is the title of the journal of 
Hispanic, Latin American and 
Spanish studies here at Carnegie 
Mellon University. Sabino 
Celaya-Barturen, a co-editor of 
VIluCM,o6 relates the meaning of 
the word to the philosophic con­
versations in old coffee houses.
Startedtwoyears ago, VIluCM,o 
began as a literary journal, pub­
lished in Spanish. Since then, it 
has experienced significant 
growth in both the scope of the
material and the number of 
people who have a helping hand 
in it. Now it is a yearly literary 
journal with informative articles 
and entertainment, as well.
“We realized that there were 
no links on campus to connect 
Hispanic students with their cul­
ture,” said Barturen, currently a 
sophomore international student 
from Spain, studying chemical 
engineering.
Barturen describes that the 
goal of VIluCM,o serves a dual 
role: one goal is to allow people 
from different cultures to learn 
about the Hispanic culture and 
language; the other goal is to em­
power Hispanic students to ex­
Gabrien Symons/Tartan Art Editor
plore their rich cultural heritage.
This year, the focus of VIluCM,o 
is on Latinos in the United States, 
such as Cubans in Miami, Puerto 
Ricans, and also popular areas 
for Latinos such as New York 
City and Southern California.
It explores the cultural changes 
for Latinos who have come to the 
United States from Hispanic 
countries and Hispanic-Ameri­
cans who have been living in the 
United States. The main article 
discusses these cultural changes 
and how it affects Hispanic liter­
ary works and is written in both 
Spanish and English. There will 
also be 10 to 12 literary articles 
written in Spanish with intro­
duction paragraphs written 
in English. Barturen ren­
dered the process of assem­
bling VIluCM,o as ayear-long 
effort. Last October, ads 
were posted around campus 
for undergraduate and 
graduate students to write 
articles for VIluCM,od
The editors did not receive 
many articles for their Feb­
ruary article deadline, but 
received many requests 
from writers for an opportu­
nity to write for VIluCM,od 
Eventually, nineteen ar­
ticles were submitted. A 
reading committee read all 
the articles and from early 
March to CMU’s spring 
break, the articles were ed­
ited. Barturen said that the 
current project is to finish 
with the layout for the 
VIluCM,od He expects that 
VIluCM,o will be distributed 
near the end of April to key 
spots around campus and 
also sent to some professors 
to distribute to their stu­
dents.

The sun was shining 
brightly on the Preliminary 
Mobot Races held in front of 
Wean Hall on Wednesday, 
April 3. However, it may have 
been shining a bit too brightly.
Mobots are robots that are 
designed to follow a white line 
on the sidewalk on the south­
ern side of the Mall area. 
These slow but steady cre­
ations are the products of se­
mesters of hard work and are 
produced by single students 
orteams. Although 
the majority of the 
robots are built by 
CS and ECE ma­
jors, anyone is al­
lowed to join. Staff 
and Faculty mem­
bers are also al­
lowed to enter as 
Open Class contes- 
tants. However, 
they cannot win 
the various cash 
prizes offered to 
the undergradu­
ates.
On the day of the 
preliminary race, 
the mobots seemed 
ready and able to 
maneuver the 
twisting course.
PE®''6 a stocky 
little black tank 
built by Dan a Mobot 
Bothell (Fifth yr. 
senior, Math/CS), won $100 
in the preliminaries by mov­
ing through 5 of the wicket­
like gates. Coming in at a far 
second was $50 winner ®M6 
built by Sam Miller (Senior, 
ECE), with only one gate. The 
rest of the contendors did not 
finish but instead veered off 
into the grass. For most of the
non-finishers, common com­
plaints were the bright sun (the 
Mobots find their positions by 
using photoelectric sensors) and 
technical problems ranging 
from battery failures to pieces 
falling off. Overall, however, 
each Mobot gave an impressive 
attempt at completing the 
course.
The other Mobots were VCluMI6 
a racecar built out of Legos and 
motors by Katherine Smith and 
Jesse Donaldson, both Sopho­
mores in CS; 4VVVV6 a long- 
nosed creature with a ambula­
tory sensor that searched for 
the white line by moving back
prepares for the race.
and forth (built by Ken Cline, a 
CS staff-member); and -olg 
built by Mark Sibenac (Junior, 
ECE), John Black(Senior, 
MechE), Will Northrop (Senior, 
MechE), and Chris Hieser (Se­
nior, MechE) and based around 
a store-bought RC car.
There was no fanfare as each 
vehicle was placed on the start­
ing line. 4VVVV waved it’s 
snout, began to move, and did 
fairly well until it left the 
course in search of greener 
pastures.
VCluMI did not go very far at 
all, and looked a bit tired in 
the warm weather and finally 
collapsed from exhaustion. 
PE®''6 with its squat frame, 
sped through the course until 
a break in the line confused it 
and it bolted.
The crowd enjoyed the spec­
tacle and the comedy of de­
feat. As each Mobot got closer 
to each goal, the expectations 
rose and the cheers began.
But when these 
poor dears failed 
to finish and ex­
citedly dashed 
off into the 
grass, the 
laughter rose 
and the stalwart 
designers 
walked onto the 
course to rescue 
their charges.
Sponsored by 
the School of 
Computer Sci­
ence, Redzone 
Robotics, and 
Schlumberger, 
the preliminary 
races showed 
Mobots with 
great promise. 
The actual races 
will occur on Fri­
day, April 19 at 
11am.
If these first, sometimes 
sad, races are any predictor, 
the upcoming final races 
should be an enjoyable expe­
rience, and, if it’s overcast, 
perhaps more of the Mobots 
will have a better chance of 
passing through all eight sil­
ver gates on to a victorious 
finish.

Billy Joel enchants local audience at lecture
By ERIC J. SALZMAN
i Voluom .Ilt1mmIM iomogIl
Billy Joel quite possibly ranks as one of the 10 
; coolest people in the world. On March 21, he came 
to The Carnegie Music Hall for “Questions, an- 
: swers, and a little music.”
The audience, consisting of about 1,800 people, 
was invited to ask Joel questions on anything. 
, When he didn’t know the answer to something, like 
! why no one is making music like the Beatles did in 
their early years, he shrugged his shoulders and 
i said, “I don’t know.” However, more often, he had 
very lengthy answers, which to the audience’s 
delight, usually consisted of some musical examples.
Joel began the three-and-a-half hour lecture/ 
show, with an explanation of what he was doing. 
He explained that when he started in the music 
business, he wrote to The Beatles asking how to be 
a success. What he got was a Beatles merchandise 
catalogue in return, and at that point, he said, he 
decided that if he ever made it big, he’d tell anyone 
interested how he did it.
And he told it all. Joel went into absolutely 
hilarious stories about his life, his music, and other 
musicians—for a piano player, this guy does great 
impressions. He mimicked the voices of Sting, 
Keith Richards, Elton John, Bob Dylan, and Paul 
McCartney while telling stories about them.
One story he told was about being invited to 
McCartney’s house. McCartney asked Joel to lis­
ten to his new album. Joel said he thought it was 
awful but didn’t have the heart to tell a Beatle,
someone who had been an idol for him while grow- hilarious. “Oh, you like that song?” he asked after 
ing up. Well, the secret’s out now. receiving a request to play “Downeastem Alexa.”
Throughout the night, Joel performed a little to As could be expected, Joel ended the

played “Scenes From an Italian Restaurant” as a had previously explained that he doesn’t ac-

from the audience 
who claimed to 
have taken up pi­
ano in the first place 
because of Joel. She 
played the Baby 
Grand piano on 
stage while he 
' played the synthe­
sizer and sang.
Like most of the 
numbers he did, 
Joel only went

“Scenes” — just 
enough to demon-.

that it was offi­

described as a classical piece about how he feels AB got an initial 50 tickets from Pitt to sell to 
when his daughter leaves at the end of weekend anyone with a CMU ID for $15 at a limit of two 
visits. tickets per ID. The tickets were bought from
Throughout the night, Joel was humble as well as Pitt for $30, but Goodall wanted to subsidize
the event for students. Because the initial i|0 
tickets sold out so quickly — in a matter pf 
minutes — AB acquired another 100 tickets 
from Pitt. “I think [the event] was wonderful^,” 
Goodall said. “I was really happy that tlje 
tickets sold out so fast, and that we were able 
to accommodate so many students.”
Dale Morgan, a sophomore MechE and Phys­
ics major, was one of those students lucky enough 
to get tickets. He said that he “wrote a paper ;.. 
a very bad paper” while camping out overhiglat 
to get tickets. He joined the line outside tHe 
information desk at three in the morning t6 get 
tickets when they went on sale at nine. \ I
Other students were willing to pay a little 
more for the sake of convenience. “I would rather 
pay the $15 more just so I don’t have to wake'up 
and stand on line,” said Veronica Lombrqzo,’a 
sophomore English major who got her ticket 
through Ticketmaster for $35.
Although it ran for over three hours, the ettttof 
the lecture still came too soon. Joel has had one 
of the most interesting lives imaginable. He 
actually dated Elle McPherson before Christie 
Brinkley. He is one of the most popular musi­
cians of all time.
He breaks all generational boundaries-with 
his popularity. And he did it all as a poor kid 
from Long Island — a rare example of the ever- 
fleeting American dream. That night, as part of 
his college lecture tour, he was kind enough to 
share some stories and advice to people looking 
to follow in his footsteps. Cool. Very cool.
Campus galleries showcase student artstic talents
By WILL WOOD
Voluom ECm,1l euo990l,uIl
There has been a proliferation of noteworthy 
shows on campus of late, and as such I will make 
note of them here.
To start with there was the show VNI eIwlIu 
iCtICf in the Ellis Gallery, on 
the third floor of CFA, before the 
break. The Ellis Gallery is not a 
very large space, and seems to 
lack any sort of versatility or 
character. Perhaps this explains 
why it is typically used just to 
hang art in — while leaving the 
space itself untransformed.
Whatever the case, it certainly 
was transformed at the hands of 
Becky Smith and Leslie Clague, 
shifting from a paradigm atically 
problematic “white cube” into a 
strange Victorian room full of 
curiosity. As the name might 
imply, it was made to look like a 
private space, perhaps housing 
the oddities collection of a 
wealthy Lord, but the curiosities 
one might expect to find in such a 
space have been secretly replaced
with Smith and Clague’s own handiwork: strange 
tongue flowers, a large and bored pollywog, a tall 
stand fully stocked with unknowable, perhaps al­
chemical contents. As I say, the Ellis only tIIft to 
lack versatility and atmosphere.
Also before the break, Allison Meyers and Alexa 
Brennan displayed their works at the Forbes Gal­
lery. The show was predominantly 
two-dimensional works tendingto- 
wards abstraction. Brennan seems 
interestedinissues of crowns, wings 
and breasts, perhaps best embod­
ied in her appropriate choice of 
sphinxes — anyone want to take a 
crack at what she is getting at with 
the use of such symbols? I think 
that her works were clear enough. 
The one work of Meyers’s that in­
trigued me the most was one that 
truly stood apart from the rest. For 
the most part, her works are color­
ful abstractions, but this one was a 
collection ofindividual works, each 
placed under a pane of glass. This 
AMIgc is a deeply personal work 
which has resonances through 
some of her other works. To me it 
was calming and quiet, and power­
fully so.
This week at the Forbes, Ian Wood, Michelle 
Vennare and Denise Soultanian had their senior 
show. Wood’s contribution to the show was an instal­
lation that incorporated the viewers as participants. 
Around the room were pictures and drawings of the 
artist, clothes, a futon and video equipment. As one 
tape — a video self portrait — 
rolled along, two other monitors 
were presenting images of the 
people in the room via two video 
cameras; these were cleverly off­
set by full length mirrors — our 
more traditional method ofwatch­
ing ourselves, selfreflectionbeing 
the thrust of the piece.
Vennare’s drawings and paint­
ings had the appearance of well- 
executed academic works from the 
figure, but if the mood, pose, and 
execution did not so compel the 
viewer, the titles betrayed some­
thing deeper in the concerns of 
the artist. The varying media, 
sizes andmatters urgedthe viewer 
to re-examine the works after the 
first time through: the individual 
pieces gain immeasurably from the context of her 
other works.
Soultanian, I think, steals the show. Sure, the
weather- vane penis is a hoot, but her paintings are 
what impress me the most. Well made, well fin­
ished, but above all they are completely original. 
She defines, in her large paintings, a whole style 
and system, complete with characters. It is rare to 
find this level of maturity in student art.
Next week’s Forbes showfeatures Monica Leeke 
and Courtney Booker. Also Leah Crowley’s P,tU
If&1a,Ia is still up for this, its last, week.

Jazz delivers soulful sounds
By NEIL DONNELLY
Voluom euo990l,uIl
Mind-bending, chaotic bursts of noise and furi­
ous speed are not solely the domain of hardcore 
and noise rock. In fact, the David S. Ware Quartet 
doesn’t fall under the blanket of either of those 
genres; this is free jazz, pure and simple. The 
Quartet, led by tenor saxophonist David S. Ware, 
and featuring Whit Dickey on drums, Matthew 
Shipp on piano, and William Parker on bass, has 
been described in the past as “the house band for 
Armageddon,” and this tag isn’t too far off the 
mark.
Who: David S. Ware Quartet 
What: Po1
Label: Homestead Records
The anarchic, clamorous style of the New York 
City-based Quartet has recently garnered a siz­
able amount of national recognition, ever since 
nlc8u1M1gc was released on Homestead Records 
last year. The release of nlc8u1M1gc by Home­
stead, a 10-year-old label known primarily for its 
indie-rock releases, exposed the Quartet to a 
wider audience than it had previously enjoyed.
This attention, besides allowing Ware to quit 
his 14-year-long day job driving a cab, gave the 
Quartet the opportunity to release another al­
bum on Homestead this year, entitledDao. Ware, 
a jazz veteran of over two decades who has often 
been compared to the likes of Sonny Rollins and 
John Coltrane, continues to wreak musical havoc 
on Po16 with Dickey, Shipp, and Parker along for 
the ride. Songs like the 18-minute “Dao Forms” 
show the Quartet at their chaotic best. Ware 
squeals and skronks on his sax, while Parker’s 
bass ascends and descends behind Ware’s frenzy.
Dickey’s drums are particularly impressive; his 
barrage of speed and force are a great complement 
to the thunderous assault of the rest of the band. 
An off-kilter, repeated piano riff by Shipp anchors 
“Rhythm Dao,” while the magnificent discord of 
Ware, Dickey, andParker runs forth unrestrained.
Ware does know when to settle down, however. 
“Tao Above Sky” features a slow and soulful sax 
courtesy of Ware, while Shipp’s sensual, twinkling 
piano sounds lurk in the background. The band 
seems to be most in sync with one another on “Dao 
Feel” — each musician seems to play off of and 
complement each other’s sound. Ware’s playing is

not as manic as it typically is, and a very melodic 
and patient pattern emerges.
For those who are brave enough to journey ¡into 
the work of the David S. Ware Quartet, a bounty of 
musical treasure awaits. Granted, free jazz is not 
for everyone; but for those with an open mind', the 
extraordinary sounds of Ware and Co. can offer a 
true “alternative” to the conventional sounds that 
most of us are accustomed to.

Everybody’s read the book. 
1^0,w see the play! - Ol,mpMI 'm 
V,fI is currently available for 
your viewing pleasure at 
Chatham College’s Eddy The­
atre.
Based on a children’s novel by 
Madeleine L’Engle, this play is 
an adaptation for children, per­
formed in the dramatic style one 
associates with Hanna Barbera 
cartoons and the old Vlomt91lfU
Ilt series. Butdon’tgetme wrong: 
This one is a gem, and for $8, you 
too can experience the magic and 
cast your memory back to a sim­
pler time when your parents took 
yputo plays just to shut you up 
fpr .an hour or two.
The play is an excitable adven­
ture that pits three children, 
Charles Wallace and Meg, and 
Calvin O’Keefe, against the evil 
darkness that threatens to de­
stroy the galaxy. They meet three 
women who teach them to tesser, 
or „to fold space, without the in­
volvement of David Lynch. So
the kids fly from place to place, 
meet interesting aliens, and save 
their father.
Directed with a certain inten­
sity by David Minniefield, the play 
never lets you forget that you are 
watching an adaptation. The ac-

tion is confusing. The melodrama 
keeps you on the edge of your seat. 
But this one is for kids, so it’s to be 
expected. As for the acting, there’s 
plenty. Joe Cannito, a 30-year old
with a bit of five o’clock shadow 
plays a five-year-old boy named 
Charles Wallace. Now, to believe 
this one, you really have to sus­
pend your disbelief high over 
your head until it kicks twice 
and dies. Next, there is Vondria 
Bergen as Meg and, get this, 
David J. Fielding as Calvin 
O’Keefe. See, Fielding is a lIoM 
actor. He plays Zordon on the

I do not want to pan this pro­
duction. It wasn’t designed for 
the college set, but it is great fun 
nonetheless. There are aliens, 
and tons of totalitarianism. 
There are lines that will leave 
you squirming with delight. 
There are funny moments, in­
teresting moments, and the ac­
tion never lets up. And if that’s 
not enough to call you out of your 
coma, there’s a dog in the play 
that is played by a girl who does 
some somersaults and cart­
wheels for your enjoyment. I 
swear, you’ll have a nice time.

Band plays with refreshing new style
By DAVE ELMAN
Voluom euo990l,uIl
There are bands whose music 
inspires violence and can clear a 
room out pretty fast, and then 
there is Sepultura. From Max 
Cavalera’s first guttural roars to 
the conclusion of the album, the 
listeners are buffeted by a bar­
rage of noise.
Who: Sepultura 
What: Roots 
Label: Roadrunner 
Records
¦ Not for the timid or close- 
minded, Sepultura is both bru­
tal and deceptively simple in its 
use of everything from the stan­
dard electric guitar and bass to 
acoustic guitar to an entire Ama­
zon tribe of singers.
For those who were impressed 
by nNo1t -dPdBs “Kaiowas,” 
“Itsari” is more of the same. This 
time, they went further, moving 
into ; the Amazon rainforest to 
rgcord in the homeland of the 
Xi&vantes tribe. Itsari means 
“f.dbts” in the Xavante language, 
and it’s not a coincidence that 
this is also the name of the al­
bum. As a whole, it deals more 
closely with their Brazilian ori­
gin than perhaps any of their 
previous recordings. This affects 
every facet of the album, from 
the berimbau and ghostly wails
that open “Attitude” to the duel­
ing vocals of Cavalera and 
Carlinhos Brown, another Bra­
zilian musician, on 
“Ratamahatta.” Far from creat­
ing a disparate environment 
where the usual heavy metal fare 
contrasts with a tribal overlay, 
the two are so entwined as to 
make them inseparable. The re­
sult is a rich sound rarely 
matched by metal artists.
“Roots Bloody Roots” is the 
album’s first single and lead track. 
Churning guitars thunder behind 
raw vocals, creating a sound that 
won’t shock fans of their previous 
work. Lyrically, it sets the mood 
for the album by urging that we all 
return to our roots. “Attitude” in­
troduces the musical feel of the 
album, a smooth, sometimes scary 
ride through Sepultura’s ugly 
world. Like many of their lyrics, it 
deals with contempt for the world 
around them, with the hope that 
things may get better. As a whole, 
they tackle heavier topics that 
many bands don’t concern them­
selves with, such as double-cross- 
ing corporations, ignorant people, 
and the environment.
“Cut-Throat” is a track that 
sticks to the formula that worked 
on -l,tI and nNo1t -dPd Sludgy 
guitar lends to the sound of 
Cavalera’s screams and roars, 
while a solid foundation of guitar 
and bass keeps the tune on course 
for maximum destruction. The
aforementioned “Ratamahatta” is 
perhaps the album’s greatest 
achievement. Melding chanting 
and vocals entirely in Portuguese 
with a guitar from Hell, this is one 
cut that is hard to forget. “Breed 
Apart” sees a speed-driven guitar 
punctured with occasional wails, 
seemingly octaves higher, and 
spoken, almost-whispered vocals. 
Spreading i ts message of inde­
pendence, Sepultura makes a plea 
to “open up your mind/and go your 
own way.” “Spit” opens with a 
high-pitched whistle leading into 
the by-now-familiar guitar that 
explodes into a wall of noise. It’s 
not really different than the rest 
of the album, but it’s certainly 
well done. “Jasco” stands out even 
on an album as diverse as this one, 
with just an acoustic guitar. El­
egant in simplicity, it is both beau­
tiful and mournful.
Perhaps the biggest disap­
pointment on the album is 
“Lookaway.” Despite beats by D J 
Lethal of House of Pain and vo­
cals by Mike Patton of Faith No 
More, it fails, possibly because 
Patton’s vocals aren’t high 
enough in the mix. Maybe it’s 
just that he reminds me too much 
of Faith No More, whose music I 
really don’t like. Despite this 
minor flaw, 411ut is one of the 
most refreshing breaths of air in 
years in a genre where almost 
everyone seems to wish they were 
like everyone else.

When it comes time for me to 
catch up on my comic book read­
ing, like over spring break, there 
is always one place I start: the 
eC8Ilfom books. Since the John 
Byrne revamp in the mid-’80s, 
the Superman books have been 
on and off my reading list.
Back in 1992 when DC decided 
to kill Superman, after a few 
months of neglecting my hobby, I 
began to read comics again. I may 
have been a sucker for that mar­
keting ploy, but ever since then 
the Superman titles have been 
No. 1 in my book. About a year 
ago, DC added a fifth book to the 
eC8Ilfom family (and to ®oufom 
also, by the way), so there is a 
eC8Ilfom book available every 
week and I now get a weekly fix 
(that is, if I have time).
Ever since the death of Super­
man, the books have been on a 
cycle of torturing the title charac­
ter. First we had the death and 
pretenders to the shield of Super­
man. After the resurrection, all 
was well, but along came the 
storyline “Dead Again,” question­
ing Superman’s identity. Later 
on we have the “Death of Clark 
Kent” and then the “Trial of Su­
perman.” Just when things seem 
to be getting simple again an old 
flame of Clark’s, Lori Lemaris, 
washes up, causing tension be­
tween Lois and Clark. The result: 
Clark gets his engagement ring 
back.
Of all the catastrophes Super­
man has dealt with, this is the 
toughest the writers have come 
up with yet. This very real situa­
tion has helped to emphasize the 
human side of this superhuman. 
The five writers, Roger Stern, 
Dan Jurgens, Louise Simonson, 
Karl Kesel, and even Dave 
Michelinie, are all doing amaz-

The art of the eC8Ilfom books 
is a bit more varied than the 
writing. You’ll never hear a kind 
word from me about Ron Frenz, 
even though he does seem to be 
imitating Jack Kirby a little less

movies y ou may have seen before...
By JOHN BIGGS
Thursday, April 11Swoon
Everybody wants a little bit of loving. But if you’re 
Leopold (Craig Chester) and Loeb (Daniel Schlachet), 
your tastes range from kidnapping to Nietzsche. 
Based on the real-life drama of two homosexual men 
who kidnapped a young boy and killed him in order 
to fulfill Loeb’s fantasy of power and existential 
purity. Pretty heady stuff.
So what happens is these two cats get arrested and 
are let off on terms of insanity. What was the matter 
with them, you ask? They were homosexuals, which 
in 1924 was considered deviant.
Directed by Tom Kalin, this is a moody movie that 
has a few agendas to process during the course of the 
action. See it with Nietzsche. He’ll love you for it. ¦
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight
Friday, April 12Othello
Wowowowow! Another literacy classic has gone 
under the knife for a little elective surgery, and 
Othello, directed by Oliver Parker, is the head 
doctor. See, the movie is all about how Othello 
(Lawrence Fishburne) wants to marry this girl 
Desdemona (Irene Jacob). Dezzie’s father doesn’t 
like the whole thing, so he hires an aide named Iago 
(Kenneth Branagh) to make Othello think that 
Cassio (named after the watch) is makin’ love to his 
honey. So anyway, Othello gets pissed off and it’s a 
real tragedy.
Most of the hard words are cut out of this movie, 
so you don’t have to worry about all the “thou”s and 
“alarums.” What you do have to worry about is how 
these people are getting off cutting and rearranging 
all these old books. Pretty spooky, if you ask me. I 
think the CIA is in on it. Don’t tell anybody I told 
you, though. There’s a lot of literature on the sub­
ject. You might want to look into it.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight
Saturday, April 13Toy Story
Now this is a movie. See, it’s all done in Clay- 
mation! Which means it was done entirely in clay! 
It’s amazing the detail and the amazing life-like 
authenticity that clay can have! Really!
What this movie is about is this guy from space 
and this cowboy who get together and then the 
cowboy pushes the space-guy out a window and 
then they have to find their way home. It’s kind of 
like The Valley of the Dolls.
Starring the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, 
this is one of the best movies this year. It’s neat, it’s 
purdy, and it’s made entirely out of clay!
At 4, 6, 8,10 pm, midnight, and 2 am.
Sunday, April 14Shaft
With a name like Shaft, it has to be good. Starring 
Richard Roundtree as John Shaft, this movie fea­
tures sex, violence, and drugs. A perfect evening out 
for the excitable viewer.
Shaft has to save a druglord’s daughter. So what 
he ddes is jump into his car and get chased around 
and beat up people. What it lacks in plot it makes up 
for in sheer vivacity: Shaft won an Oscar. I didn’t 
think anything named Shaft could win anything, 
but it did. Pretty neat, no? See it with a druglord. 
He’ll love you for it.

Phat Clutch concert rocks club audience
By RYAN DONAVAN
Voluom euo990l,uIl
I have one word for you— 
PHAT. Last Tuesday, Graffiti 
was the victim of an invasion by 
the American psycho band 
Clutch. They had come to do two 
things: kick ass and chew bubble 
gum. And they were fresh out of 
gum.
The concert began with two 
hardcore warm-up bands, Pist- 
On and Core. Pist-On was pretty 
lively (the band was lively, the 
crowd was not), but overall not 
all that impressive. Some fast 
guitarwork and a few catchy riffs 
stood out against the remainder 
of their generic set. It was obvi­
ously a tough crowd for them to 
play, as everyone was waiting for 
Clutch. The lead vocalist knew 
it, too. At one point he said, 
“Hear that? I think it’s a cricket.”
Core was better musically, es­
pecially the bassist, with his
groovin’ bass lines. The drum­
mer was pretty good as well, play­
ing rhythms that matched the 
bassist nearly perfectly. Thegui- 
tarist-slash-vocalist was, well, not 
so hot. The music could have 
definitely done without his 
screechy vocals, and his at­
tempted psychedelic solos came 
out to be more annoying than 
anything else. When they left, it 
was time for Clutch to get ready. 
The floor began to fill with people.
From the moment Clutch 
stepped out on the stage, vocalist 
Neil Fallon’s intensely piercing 
stare cut every member of the 
audience to the core. Then, be­
fore you could say “combine,” they 
ripped into a frenzied rendition 
of “12 Ounce Epilogue.” The 
floor exploded. Everyone went 
nuts and ran around like luna­
tics, crashing into each other, 
pushing, falling, etc. (it really was 
fun, trust me). It set the tone for 
the rest of the show.
Clutch kept the energy going 
throughout the show by playing 
alternately fast, frenetic tunes 
and their slower, groovier songs. 
Of course, many of their slower 
songs had fast parts and vice- 
versa. They would play a mellow 
(for Clutch at least) song like “7 
Jam” and follow with a kick to the 
rear in the form of “Texan Book of 
the Dead.”
I only have two complaints 
about the show. First, they didn’t 
play “A Shogun Named Marcus” 
(you may have seen the video on 
MTV, it had a shot of a pig with 
big testicles running) and “Tight 
Like That,” two of my personal 
favorites. They also ended the 
concert on a down note. They 
trailed off their last tune by jam­
ming, and that was cool, but 
slowly, one by one, the members 
of Clutch put down their instru­
ments and left, until it was just 
the drummer and bassist playing 
together. Then they stopped and
left, and that was it.
My second complaint involves 
several people who were pushiiig 
people excessively hard and re­
ally seemed out to hurt someone. 
There was a group of three friends 
in particular (you know who you 
are, bastards). I was shoulder- 
tackled by one of them out of the 
blue (this is not a kosher mosh 
technique, for you non-moshers; 
correct moshing generally in­
volves flailing uncontrollably), 
and I overheard them bragging 
about “plowing through every­
one.” I could begin a large rant at 
this point, but I’ll be kind and 
spare you.
Seeing Clutch is a must for any 
fan — their music is a whole rieto 
experience when heard live. ' ’,"
So if you are a fan of Clutch, of 
other hardcore music, and you 
happen to see the announcement' 
of one of their concerts in tiie 
paper, go to the show. Repeat as 
directed.
Alternative band continues fine tradition
By JOHN BIGGS
Voluom j1lCf Aa,u1l
Poi Dog Pondering, a Hawaiian 
alternative band whose history 
twines back into the last decade, 
has produced a new album, .1fIU
glomouI6 full of an unusual mix of 
made-for-public-radio songs.
Who: Poi Dog 
Pondering 
What: Pomegranate 
Labei: Pomegranate 
Records
Full of pop and circumstance, 
this album is fun and interesting, 
but falls flat when the band tries 
to move in the realms of latter-day 
Billy Joel and “deep” bands like 
Crash Test Dummies and Count­
ing Crows.
Where to begin? The first song, 
“Pomegranate,” is a string-laden 
piece that is religious and kind of 
interesting. Nothing new, nothing 
old. The next 
song, however,
“Catacombs,” is 
quite nice, and 
in fact my favor­
ite song on the 
album. With a 
quick beat and 
an easy feeling, 
the story of a 
man dead and 
trapped under­
ground is told 
simply and well 
by lead singer Frank Orrall. There 
is a calm in most of the lyrics, but 
when Orrall talks of “words” that 
are “like a string I pull out of my
» 1995
mouth,” I’m a little nonplussed.
“Complicated” is the one rein­
carnation-based gospel song on the 
album, and “The Chain” is the 
obligatory 
dance track. 
“Sandra at the 
Beach” is a 
sweet postcard 
of a woman in 
love with an­
other woman: 
Sandra and her 
lover wander 
the beach. 
“Sandra looks 
good today/ I 
Pomegranate Records think that she’s 
in love,” says Orrall.
“God’s Gallipoli” is jumpy and 
exitable. “A1 le luia” is calming. 
Overall, the album is full of good
songs with occasional high points 
that make it worth buying. Like 
some recent concert-based bands', 
namely Rusted Root and Blues 
Traveler, there is a certain 
sameness that is comforting 
throughout the album.
You know what the Poi Dog Pon­
dering crew has in store for you', 
but they change that expectation 
each time you flip to the next song. 
Not repetative, this album is quite 
the contrary: No song is the same, 
except near the end when they 
become a blur, and each image 
and idea is clear and concise 
through each track.
.1fIglomouI is a good album. 
While not incredible and by no 
means a crowning achievement 
for Poi Dog Pondering, it is enter­
taining and well worth a listen. -
