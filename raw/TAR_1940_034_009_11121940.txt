“House of Connelly’t 
Begins Week’s Run
There’s an open house tonight 
at the Fine Arts Theater—but you 
• still need tickets. It’s the opening 
of the new Drama Department 
production, “The House of Con­
nelly.”
Mary Morris, who played Mrs. 
Connelly in the original Grotip 
Theater production, is directing 
the play, a dramatic insight into 
¦ the disintegration of a typical aris­
tocratic southern family. The ac­
tion takes place in the early twen­
tieth century, and there is an in­
teresting background, in the play, 
of old plantation songs' sung by 
the “negro" chorus.
The cast of “The House of Con­
nelly” is a large one. Principal 
players are William Eythe ’41 
and Herbert Browar ’41 as Will 
Connelly, Shirley Brown ’41 arid 
Molly van Ameringen ’42 as Patsy 
Tate, and Jerome Kurtz ’41 and 
Carl Betz ’43 as Uncle Bob.
Performances of the play will 
run until next Tuesday. A special 
matinee, for which no tickets will 
be required, is being presented this 
Friday, November 15.
Carnegie Grad
Meet the new Honorary Cadet 
Colonel—Margaret Sullivan, who 
received her appointment last Fri­
day night amidst the gaity of the 
Military Ball. Second in Com­
mand is June Cooper, .by direct 
order of the Advanced R. O. T. C. 
Corps.
As the coeds emerged from a 
Saber arch at the Military Ball, 
they were presented with insignia 
by Col. Kuentz in recognition of 
their rank.
Those promoted to the rank of 
Major were Betty Kreh, Hilda 
Horner, Sally Williams, and Pol­
ly Jensen.

PiKAs Win 
Exhibit Award
Every year, along about Pitt- 
Tech time, travelers through the 
Tech campus are somewhat aston­
ished by numerous signs warn­
ing a bedraggled Panther of 
his impending fate..
You’ve guessed it! These, are 
the homecoming decorations, orig­
inally intended to welcome home 
the “old brothers.” They still 
serve this purpose; but due to the 
competitive spirit on our campus 
the various- fraternity artists have 
sought to outdue each other to 
such an extent that Interfraternity 
Council decided, to offer a cup for 
the best decoration. This year 
the Council appointed a committee 
consisting of Dr. Gregg of the His­
tory Dept, and Mr. Parshall of the 
English Dept, to pick the winner. 
Decorations are judged on their 
artistic appeal and effectiveness, 
the appropriateness of the design 
motif and the amount of effort 
- expended in building the decora­
tion. .
On the basis of these points the 
committee presented the Pi K. A.’s 
with the cup for the best home­
coming design. This will be a per­
manent cup, incidentally. The 
boys from Morewood employed a 
large, square design showing a 
Scottie dog peppering the Cathe­
dral of Learning with machine- 
gun fire from behind Machinery 
Hall.
Due to conditions in Europe 
many of the fraternities carried 
out war themes in depicting the 
downfall of the Panther. The sig­
ma Nus made a no-man’s land out 
of their front yard—with trenches, 
tanks and even a crashed airplane. 
The Betas built a great big battle­
ship on their porch which carried 
pennants informing passers-by of 
a Pitt defeat. Hitler, Mussolini 
and Stalin—and the Panther, of 
course—were used by the Beta 
Sigs. The Kappa Sigs showed a 
Scotchman in a tank advancing 
on ,a panther hiding behind 
trenches,
of Captains, the R. O. T. C. chose 
Anne Hinkley, Jean Hayden, Jean 
Kirkwood, Mary Helen O’Connor, 
Theresa Dumont, Ruth Wood, 
Ruth Orr, Shirley Karper, and 
.Janet Lang. Formal pledging of 
members for the Scabbard ond 
Blade was conducted when the 
new Iionoraiy Officers pinned rib­
bons upon the uniforms of the 
. pledges.
From fifteen Tech coeds nom­
inated by the Scabbard and 
Blade, National Military Honor­
ary, the Advanced R. O. T. C. 
Corps selected their new officers.
The number of candidates eligi­
ble for the honorary coeds of­
ficers is determined by the number 
of officers in the R. O. T. C. 
Corps. For each officer in the 
corps, a corresponding officer is 
selected in the coed group.

Brain Teaser
For the benefit of the engineers 
this column offers for the first time 
a problem requiring the calculus 
for its solution. When the proper 
approach is used, however, the in­
tegration is so simple that it could 
almost be carried out mentally. 
Here is the problem. A goat is 
tied to one end of a rope 20 feet 
long, the other end of the rope be­
ing fastened to the side of a circu­
lar silo 14 feet in diameter at the 
easternmost point P of the silo. 
Neglecting the length of the goat’s 
neck, etc.; over what area can the 
goat graze?
Answer on page two
Man-o’-war’s-man, commission­
ed officer in the Navy, architect, 
poet, and now author, are all to be 
listed in the impressive career of 
Ralph M. Crosby, A ’21, who has 
just completed his first full-length 
book.
“We Have Met the Enemy,t” 
which is soon to be published by 
Bobbs-Merrill, is an historical 
novel of the War of 1812. A parf 
of Commodore Oliver Hazard Per­
ry’s famous message reporting his 
victory over Captain Robert Bar­
clay furnishes the title for the 
book in which Commodore Perry 
is one of the principal characters.
Mr. Crosby spent months in re­
search so that his story might be 
historically correct in every detail. 
His years in the Navy, ending with 
his services as a lieutenant during 
. the World War, account in part for 
the amusing and vigorous dialogue 
which runs through the book.
Although Mr. Crosby has been 
successful as an architect, he spent 
last summer in the South do­
ing research work for his next 
book, which has been already 
started. This too is to be an his­
torical novel, but deals with the 
Civil War, having its center of ac­
tion about the Mississippi River.

Rules Group 
Now Includes 
Student Heads
In the past, disciplinary action 
on student conduct was effected by 
two committees; the Discipline 
Committee, a fact-finding body 
serving at times as a jury if a stu­
dent did not confess to the Pen­
alties Committee. This latter com­
mittee, composed of Dr. Warden, 
the director of the particular col­
lege, and a faculty member from 
each school, enacted penalties 
against students. Both committees 
recommended rules and regula­
tions to the Executive Board, 
which in turn either accepted or 
rejected them.
With the recent reorganization, 
however, a new commitee on Rules 
and Regulations was formed 
as a sub-committee of the Execu­
tive Board. It has assumed the 
functions of both old committees. 
It has the power to recommend to 
the Board ’changes in rules and 
regulations governing student con­
duct. It can supercede any of the 
student organizations.
One faculty member from each 
college or division is to be recom­
mended by the ^Director of the 
college, subject to the approval of 
President Doherty. Steps have 
been taken to provide student rep­
resentation, including the follow­
ing members Presidents of Day 
Student Council, Interfraternity 
Council, Intersorority Council, 
Men’s Dormitory Council and Wo­
men’s Dormiory Council. A rec­
ommendation has been made for 
the inclusion of the President of 
the Citcom clan on this standing 
committee.
The present committee is com­
posed'of the following: Dr. War­
den, Director of Division ol: Stu­
dent Personnel, Chairman; Profes­
sor Dennison, Engineering; Profes- 
¦ sor'Fisher, Fine Arts;' Professor 
Lawler, General Studies; Profes­
sor Staley, Margaret Morrison; Mr. 
Irwin, Physical Welfare; Miss. 
Marie Davis; Mr. William Floyd; 
Mr. Ralph Martin, Mr. Jack 
O’Toole, and Miss Betty Jane 
Yeagle. This committee also takes 
over the functions of the former 
committee on eligibility code.
Vacation Notice
By a recent action of the 
Executive Board, the dates of 
the Christmas Recess' for this 
year are changed. Classes will 
continue in December up to and 
including Saturday, December 
21, and will not resume in Jan­
uary until Monday, January G. 
In other words, the Christmas 
Recess will extend from Sun­
day, December 22, to Sunday, 
January 5, inclusive.
When we first heard the name 
—Ashur Ben-Ami Etkes—we im­
mediately began dreaming of a 
dark skinned, turban-swathed na­
tive who sat under a palm tree in 
some blue-skied, far off country 
and watched the camels drift by. 
Certainly we didn’t expect a fair 
skinned, blond, fast-talking “typ­
ical American” who was more in­
terested in football practice than 
anything else. But that’s what we 
got, in the person or Ashur Ben- 
Ami Etkes, who came to Carnegie 
this year.
Until three years ago “Ash” 
(may we get chummy?) lived in 
the seaport city of Haifa, in Pal­
estine. You probably have been 
reading about the importance of 
Haifa as a strategic port for the 
British fleet. Situated on the 
Mediteranean, as it is, the mix­
ture of the population can be un­
derstood—there are about a mil­
lion and a half people in Pales­
tine, of these one-half million are 
Jews, nine hundred thousand are 
Arabs,•, and the rest are German, 
English and French. In spite of 
the seemingly unmixable races, 
Ashur says that they all live fair­
ly peaceable. (Fairly?)
Palestine Schools Different
The Arabs are the only ones 
who have public schools, and these 
wretched rooms could hardly be 
called schools. There are private 
schools, however, which, are. aid­
ed slightly by government funds—

British, of course. It was to one 
of these half traditional, half pla­
toon schools that Ash went every 
day to learn not his three R’s, but 
Bible, History, Hebrew, Arabic, 
Mathematics, French and Geog­
raphy. You understand that these 
are only required subjects. It is 
very interesting to hear that in 
the study of geography, Palestine 
is studied first, American history 
and geography next, and then 
World history.
To hear Ashur rattling off the 
latest scores (on request he’ll even 
tell you how the Kansas City 
Kuckoos made out in 1924) would 
make you believe that he had been 
fed miniature footballs and base­
balls since babyhood, but we know 
better. He never heard of either 
game until his arrival in the States 
three years ago.
Preferred Carnegie to Annapolis
At that time Ash’s father be­
gan wondering why his son kept 
poking around in the drafting 
rooms of Papa Etkes’ offices. In 
these offices, by the way, were 
drawn plans for many of the 
British-built roads, bridges and 
buildings now in Palestine, Un­
known to his father, Ash had be­
come very interested in this type 
of engineering, and so surprised 
Papa one day by announcing that 
he wanted to go to an engineering 
school in America. Well, letters 
from sixty-eleven recommended 
colleges came overseas to the Haifa

Rev. R. Gibson 
Speaks Today
Rev. Robert W. Gibson* of the 
Third United Presbyterian Church, 
will* speak at chapol today. He 
has spoken here many times be­
fore, and the students have always 
greatly enjoyed his talks. His 
topic as yet is undecided.
Rev. Gibson was schooled at 
Muskingum college, New Concord, 
Ohio, and he received his religious 
education at the Pittsburgh 
Xenia Theological Seminary.
Due to the steady decrease In 
chapel attendance, a special plea 
is made to the students to support 
this function, silice' il is Well worth 
the effort. All freshmon are re­
quired to attend the chapels and a 
special check will be made this 
Tuesday.
The program Is sponsored by the 
men’s and women’s dormitories.

Conversation Club 
Elects Officers 
For School Year
Interested students have recent­
ly organized a modern language 
club on this campus, for those who 
want to increase their facility in 
French, Spanish, and German. The 
next meeting will be held next 
Tuesday evening at 8:00 o’clock 
in the Carnegie Union.
Thus far the organization has 
met twice. The elected officers 
are: President, Andre Szoke; Vice- 
President, Duncan Del Toro; Sec- 
retary-Treasurer, June Cooper; 
and Program Chairman, Harry 
Claypool. Mr. Leo Carroll, lan­
guage teacher, is the faculty ad­
viser. The club plans to meet once 
every two weeks, at which times 
it will be addressed by foreign 
speakers. The members are en­
couraged not to use English in 
their conversations during the 
meeting.
Some of the members are of 
foreign origin and have mastery of 
several languages. However, re­
quirements for membership in­
clude only an interest in some 
modern tongue and a slight ac­
quaintance with it. Fluency is not 
required.
New Union Head 
Is Well Known 
In I jocal Activities
With the new duties she has ac­
quired by becoming Assistant to 
the Dean of Students, Mrs. Charles 
Yon is no longer able to continue 
taking care of the Alumni House. 
Mrs. Jean McCrory Newman has. 
replaced her as Hostess of the 
Alumni House.
Mrs. Newman is a well-known 
native of Pittsburgh. After finish­
ing at Dilworth Hall, formerly the. 
prep school of P. C. W., she en­
tered Monmouth College, Illinois. 
She studied in the Conservatory 
there. While at school, she be­
came a member of Kappa Kappa 
Gamma. It is quite interesting to 
note that this sorority, one of the 
largest in the country, started at 
this small school.
After graduating she continued 
her music studies for two years in 
New York. Living among artists, 
she became acquainted with music 
and musical organizations. Re­
turning to Pittsburgh, she became 
soloist in the Sewickley Presby­
terian Church, a position which 
she has hold for twenty-one years.
She was a member of a radio 
trio, “The Fireflies,” in ,the early 
days of KDKA. She feels, however, 
that radio Is a terrible business— 
“everything is so unsure." She has 
had many local concert engage-' 
ment, on several occasions sing­
ing “Messiah” at different district 
colleges.
Mrs. Newman has been quite 
active In the College Club and 
Tuesday Musical Club,' and has 
been secretary of the board of the 
latter for five years. For many 
years; she has handled the pub- 
1 icily for both of these clubs, also 
acquiring a reputation for concert 
work—arranging and managing 
local concerts.
Recently, she was appointed 
head of the “All Nations Festival,” 
which the city of Pittsburgh holds 
annually on Flagstaff Hill, on the 
'I th of July.
Her husband, who died a few 
years ago, sang with Mrs. Yon in 
a quartet. Mrs. Newman now lives 
with her mother near Highland 
Park. Althought her first duty is to 
take care of the building, Mrs. 
Neuman wants to be of service as 
hostess to students, alumni and 
faculty.
F reslimen Hold 
Annual Dance
Continuing a Tech tradition of 
long standing, the Freshman Class 
will sponsor the annual Freshman 
All-Carnegie dance this Saturday 
evening in Thistle Hall at 9 
o’clock.
Earlier in the year the upper 
class held a dance in honor of 
this year’s crop of plebes (Wel­
come Freshman), so now the 
freshies are reciprocating. A well- 
known local orchestra has been 
engaged to provide the music for 
the occasion; it is none other than 
that of Len Malvern, who has 
played for many dances—tea and 
otherwise—here at Tech.
Those in charge of the dance 
will be the presidents and vice- 
presidents of the freshmen classes 
in all schools. They are: Herbert 
Asten and Jim Voeltz in Engineer 
ing; Jim Boyce and Harvey Haines 
in Fine Arts; arid Sarah Jane Moir 
and Ruth Beall in Maggie Murph. 
The deans of the respective col­
leges will be guests, and several 
members of the faculty and their 
wives have been asked to chap­
eron. Tickets may be purchased 
from the above committee for 
$1.25.

So long as the goat is east of the 
meridian through P it can evident­
ly graze over a semicircle of ra­
dius 20 feet (the length of the 
rope) and area 200 pi. Whenever 
the goat is $est of the medidian 
through P, however, a part PQ of 
the rope will be wrapped around 
the silo, while the remainder QG 
(G representing the goat) is in a 
straight line tangent to the silo 
and perpendicular to OQ, where O 
is the center of the base of the silo. 
Let a represent the angle POQ in 
radian measure, and let A repre­
sent the northern half of the graz­
ing area west of the meridian 
through P.
A is then the area swept over 
by the free part QG of the rope as 
A varies from 0 to 20/7. The ele­
ment of area is to be taken as the 
area between two nearby positions 
of QG it may be regarded as a 
sector of a circle of radius QG= 
(20-7a) and angle d a, since the 
angle between two positions of QG 
is the same as the angle between 
the corresponding positions of OQ. 
The area of this sector is one-half 
(20-7a squared) da; integrating 
this expression from O to 20/7 
gives A=8000/42. The total re­
quired area is (200 pi) plus 2A or 
1009.27 sq. ft., to the nearest hun­
dredth.
The locus of G, when the rope is 
taut and G is west of the meridian 
through P, jis called an involute of 
a circle. Note that we have been 
able to find the area which it en­
closes without finding its equation 
in any coordinate system.

Last week we cast our first vote, it was very thrilling, except 
that all during the rest of the day we were haunted by the thought 
we had pulled the wrong lever. We finally talked ourselves into 
believing that you can't iniss on a voting machine, but there is 
always that nagging little thought in the back of our head, “What 
iI: we voted for that other person?”
II was interesting to see democracy at work in the garage of 
our apartment house. The voters stood in line, with an early- 
morning bleariness on their faces. A stout man with a cigar, 
named Marry, went around and gave everyone little cards to fill 
out;. Then a man named Ben came around and gave everyone the 
same little cards, completely ignoring a woman in a hat who 
kept saying, “Harry took care of them, Ben.” The lady in front 
of us spent about five minutes trying to close the green curtains 
of the little voting booth, .until Harry, having used up all his 
cards, came and explained to her that they close automatically 
when you push a lever to start the machine. Tlie man in back of 
CM- turned out to be a teacher of ours whom we hadn’t seen in 
five years. The man in back of him was going from the polls to 
the hospital, where he would have his tonsils out.
That night, our father, a staunch New Dealer, sat long at the 
radio, gloating over the returns. Our uncle from Chicago, a 
staunch but realistic Willkieite, went to bed at 11:30, when Mc- 
Nary conceded the election. We sat up until three o’clock— 
writing a theme.
Frustration
When we graduated from high school, a relative of ours gave 
us an old portable, wind-up victrola he’d had around the house 
for some years. Fired by the thought of an enormous record col­
lection, we bought a lot of stuff. The victrola died without hope 
of resiiirrection on the second record, and we haven’t been able 
to play the records since. We keep meaning to buy something— 
an attachment, or something—but every time we manage to save 
enough money, we’ve got to spend it for something else, like going 
to summer school, or a new. typewriter, or going bond for Uncle 
Looey. Our family, whose finances are at the point where they 
buy a Sunday paper and read it all week, won’t consider a record 
player—they say it’s not the initial cost, it’s the upkeep. (Our 
family has a notoriously weak will power.) It’s been five years 
now. We’re working on a device by which you diet until your 
hands are just skin and bone, hold a phonograph needle in your 
fingers, and scratch like mad. It doesn’t work.
Orgy 4
The Editor, the Managing Editor, and tlie Business Manager 
have gone to a convention in Detroit. A convention of college 
newspaper functionaries" is a terrifying thought, and we’re glad 
we’re not important enough to have gone. (Editor’s note: Sour 
grapes!) We can see them, standing in little groups all over the 
city of Detroit, comparing notes on the best way to talk cuts out 
of the city newspapers, how to entice the Freshmen to tlie office 
to write headlines and do similar unpleasant things, and how to 
include all the stories about the weekly meetings of such organiza­
tions as the Intermural Sophomore Quilting Club and still have 
an interesting paper—which last is sort of like trying to walk a 
light rope clad in a diver’s suit.

To City Champs
Pritchard Stars 
As Skibos Show Steady I in provein en t.
Last Monday the Freshman 
cross-country team lost a very 
close meet to Langley High, erst­
while city champs, by a score oC 
2G to 25). Times of the individ­
ual Tech men were reduced ma­
terially in this meet, which is en­
couraging.
From reliable sources we have 
heard that Pritchard is the star in 
all the meets. He has won all his 
races -very easily this season. 
Coach Halferty is very much 
pleased with his performances be­
cause he seems to be a natural— 
he lilces to run, always the first 
one to turn up for practice, he is a 
smart track man, and there is no 
lost motion in his stride. In the 
opinion of Mr. Halferty, lie is the 
greatest runner since Pinkerton, 
the greatest miler Tech ever had 
—considered the best in the Tri- 
State area.
Other runners who showed up 
well in last week’s meet are 
Hershfield and Macosko. The meet 
was the. closest this season which 
indicates that Tech is making pro­
gress in the line of track.
THISTLEDOWN
HOMECOMING’S OVER
----——---- By Bill Floyd, Sports Editor ---------------
Score: Pitt 6, Tech 0
There are several interesting features we all should know 
concerning ’ the past contest with our “back door” neigh­
bors. First, and most important, five members of the Tartan 
squad played sixty minutes of football last Saturday. Next, 
Pittsburgh University is blessed with a football squad of approxi­
mately forty young men. with' better than average football ability 
—no iess than thirty-three of these men saw action this past week­
end. Further, the Skibo squad was hindered by the inability of 
.several of their key players to enter the game, and in addition, 
more than half of the men who composed the starting team for 
old Carnegie entered the game under some type of physical 
handicap.
This is not intended to be a printed crying session, but rather 
an attempt to point out certain items that had to do with the loss 
Jianded our,-, squad last ^eek. These several interesting items 
might also help to explain why eleven completely tired football 
players were unable to carry the pigskin three yards when op­
posed by a near dozen fresh gridde'rs. A back glance-at the 
statistics of the game will show you that our team was far from 
out-played, and definitely not out-gained or out-maneuvered. 
Still, the score stands: Pitt 6,' Tech 0—enough said.
Intramural All-Carnegie Team
The Tartan Sports Staff with the cooperation of Mister 
Eyman, and the Intramural referees have picked an All-Carnegie 
Touch Football team. We have attempted to pick the men 
-who in our opinion played the most consistent game of heads up 
football. The team is as follows: Shymowsky, Jr. Met;
Padden, Delt; Herre, DU; Dierker, Jr. Met; Lochhead, Delt; 
and Reynolds, Boss Hall. Those, receiving Honorable Mention 
are-: Van Nort, Delt; Hobbs, DU; Richards, PiKA; Gaub, Kappa 
Sig; Patton, ATO; Dobson, Beta; Durbin, Delt; and Deans, PiKA. 
More Space
One of the noticeable features of the post Intramural contests 
was the seemingly lack of proper space in which to play the 
scheduled games. In previous years the fields have been laid out 
perpendicular to the walk that travels the length of the cut, 
however, this season a new form of playing field set up was at­
tempted, that is having three fields, each paralleling the cut. This 
set up, although much superior to the former arrangement, still 
“fails to give the Intramuralists adequate space in which to play.
To help in the obtaining of more playing space why would it 
not be.possible'to remove, by means of a steam shovel, the hump 
‘of land that lies next to the embankment below Whitfield Hall? 
Although, this would entail some expense the value gained by 
providing adequate space for- Intramural contests and thereby 
sponsoring a much fuller program would more than offset this 
initial expense.
IJownmg Jr. IVlots
Winding up the present Intra­
mural football program, the Delts 
and DUs met on the cut in a game 
which the Delts won 14-2. The 
Delt clan outplayed their oppo­
nents the entire game, scoring two 
touchdowns and four first downs 
to the DUs two first downs. The 
DUs never seemed to get started, 
one of the best reasons for this 
was the fast rushing exhibited by 
Tom Durbin and Van Nort which 
kept the passer from throwing ac­
curately. Padden connected with 
his receivers quite regularly, one 
pass to Lockhead being good for 
a touchdown.
Going into the semi-finals, there 
were three teams, the Delts, DUs, 
and Junior Mets. The Delts drew 
a bye and moved into the final 
bracket. In the first game be­
tween the Jr. Mets and the DUs, 
the Jr. Mets won when the DUs 
were penalized into a first down 
for their opponents, making the 
score.7-6. However, the DUs won 
a protest and the game was play­
ed over, the DUs becoming the 
winner in the decisive contest. 
They then moved into the finals 
where they were defeated by the 
Delts.
Touch football has become more 
popular each year since its install­
ation as an intramural sport three 
years ago. This is the second 
year that the Delts have the cup, 
winning it also in 1939 after a 
hard struggle.
There will probably be a change 
in the point system next year for 
the point trophy which is awarded 
every year. Points will be given 
to the respective groups for the 
team having the most sportsman­
like attitude and for the individ­
ual player having this same char­
acteristic.
CHANG DUNN TONY LAPOSIU
Chang: Dunn and Tony Laposki, two of Tech’s Iron Men, would 
be welcomed to any team in the country with open arms. Dunn cli­
maxed a fine game by blocking- a Pitt punt. Laposki turned in a 
terrific afternoon before leaving the game with a bad shoulder.
Jones, Muha Star 
As Pitt Tops Plaid
Goal Line Stand 
In Closing Minutes 
Stops Tartan Bid
By George Tondorf 
Two yards of gridiron turf and 
a stone wall defense by the Pan­
ther first-string fine spelled the 
difference between victory and de­
feat for the Tartan eleven in the 
stadium last Saturday. A blocked 
kick by “Chang” Dunn in the 
closing minutes of the game, with 
the Plaid on the short end of a 
6-0 count, made at least a tie by 
Tech seem a certainty, but three 
cracks at the .line and a left end 
run by Muha resulted in a net 
loss of one yard, and the ball went 
over to the stubborn Panthers on 
downs.
Once again it was Edgar Jones 
who proved the nemesis . of.. the 
.Skibos as he skirted the ends 
with express-train speed. Last 
year “Special Delivery” downed 
the Plaid with a desperate GO 
yard touchdown heave; this year 
he did it with one of his copy­
righted excursions around the .end, 
scoring from the 12 yard line 
without a Tartan touching him.
But Jones did not have a mo­
nopoly on the glory of the fray. 
The Skibo’s George Muha tumr 
ed in one of the finest exhibitions 
of offensive and defensive play 
ever seen in the stadium. All aft­
ernoon he did the major part of 
the mail-carrying for the locals,
and repeatedly hurled the Pan­
thers back with long spiralling 
punts. In the safety position he 
covered the field from sideline to 
sideline, and cut a Pitt bid for 
touchdown land short by inter­
cepting a pass deep in Plaid ter­
ritory.
Nor was George the only one 
who played his heart out for the 
Tech cause. The entire Tartan 
squad, although out-manned, bat­
tled the Panther blow for blow, 
displaying the stamina and cour­
age for which the sons of Carnegie 
are famous.

As Soccermen 
Suffer Defeat
A{;, o o’clock last Saturday morn­
ing Tech’s Varsity soccer squad 
suffered the third consecutive de­
feat of 2 to 0. This time it was 
Frostberg Slate Teachers who 
dealt the blow. It was definitely 
the best game we’ve played this 
year, and it really should have 
been a 0 to 0 score; but because 
our team accidently put the ball 
in the wrong goal, the opponents 
got one of their points. The other 
point was won when our goalie 
fumbled a kicked ball allowing one 
of Frostberg’s men to kick a goal. 
Gail Platt and Ivin Sivachek play­
ed an excellent game, and Chris 
Smith was taken to the doctor be­
cause of an injury to his eye due 
to a collision with another player.
The next game on the Tartan 
schedule is with Franklin and 
Marshal at Lancaster which is ex­
pected to be a very good game 
since our team is getting good 
competitive experience. The last 
scheduled game of the season was 
with Buffalo State Teachers, but 
it has been cancelled and we are 
to play Oberlin on the Carnegie 
soccer field. Any persen who en­
joys a game crammed full of ac­
tion and excitement is invited to 
attend.

Sigma Delta Phi 
Is- Newly Formed 
Social Fraternity
Many Events j-----------------------

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR . . .
By New Group
Realizing that there was a place 
on the campus of Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology for an organi­
zation which could unify into a 
close-knit organization students 
from various departments and sec­
tions, a group of men resolved to 
band together to form a new fra­
ternity. The underlying ideas and 
aims of this new group are to cre­
ate a feeling of good-fellowship, 
encourage interest in campus af­
fairs, promote cooperation, and 
encourage and promote scholar­
ship.
The name chosen by the found­
ers of this new organization is 
Sigma Delta Phi. It is aimed to 
make the newly-formed group a 
social fraternity, and the members 
are to be chosen based on a set 
of standards which has been 
adopted by the organization. Mem­
bers are to be extended bids and 
pledged in the usual manner in 
vogue for social groups. Charac­
ter, true ' fellowship, dignity of 
purpose, and loyalty to a cause are 
standards by which membership 
shall be gauged.
For some time the founders of 
this new organization have been 
aware that there was and is a lack 
of unity among the various groups 
and they felt that with the right 
spirit and interest these gaps could 
. be bridged and thereby create a 
better campus spirit. By promot­
ing within the group the codes 
adopted by the fraternity it is the 
hope that a nucleus may be form­
ed which can work toward better 
feeling on the campus.
Meetings have been held regu­
larly since last February, when 
the fraternity Anally took form, 
with social gatherings arranged 
throughout the summer consisting 
of picnics and steak fries which 
were held at both the North and 
South County Parks. As the or­
ganization grows, more social ac­
tivities and functions are to be 
added and the scope of the frater­
nity enlarged.

sweet devotees, appreciation can 
be expressed by merely . . .
dressing for the occasion. The 
occasion, incidentally, is not just; 
another dance, but a CARNEGIE 
dance. Let’s have, then, gowns 
on Saturday evenings . 
please?
My! How beautiful girls look 
in long gowns. It’s too bad that 
the girls who come to our dances 
do not take this advantage to dis­
play their charms.
It always seemed to me that 
girls enjoyed dressing up. They 
always seemed happiest when 
they were most beautiful. And 
their boys friends were happiest 
when they “showed off” their 
lovely ladies when they were 
loveliest.
The general trend at our dances 
is away from gowns and toward 
sport clothes. Economically there 
may be some justification for this, 
but I can see little saving when 
thè loveliness of our girls must 
pay for this saving.
You may argue that there is a 
saving in time getting dressed. I 
say “poppy-cock." Women have 
always invested the greater part of 
their lives beautifying themselves 
and they always will. I say they 
should. For when there comes 
a time that woman are no longer 
attractive, no longer lovely, no 
longer the most beautiful crea­
tures on earth, I’m going to hide in 
a cave and become a hermit. And 
I'll bet that every man, boy, and 
small male child will do likewise.

I’ve been hanging around Ad­
ministration Hall at a quarter to 
seven the last few evenings trying 
to find out what attracts our male 
students to that corridor. Hal 
Geilman says there’s no special 
reason . . . and anyhow she 
doesn’t get there until 7:30.
While, we’re on the subject, 
there’s a nice little number who 
stands in the doorway of the Fine 
Arts Building on Tuesday and 
Thursday evenings about 10:15 . . . 
probably waiting for her grand­
mother.

It seems you can’t have friends 
even if you’re neutral when dis­
cussing the political campaigns. 
I’ve been wearing a “In either 
case, keep cool” button • . . and 
now they tell me I ought to have 
an opinion. What’s the use.
By the way, do you think you 
know any good jokes? I’ve heard 
jokes told, and I’ve heard them 
laughed at, but if you want real 
appreciation, for one of your jokes 
tell it to John Freeman over in 
145, Industries, some Tuesday 
evening. If you want to hear the 
joke that led me to this 180 lbs. 
of appreciation just drop a stamp­
ed, self-addressed envelope in the 
Plaid box, near the supply room. 
It’s guaranteed to win friends and 
influence pupils.
That’s all for now . . . see you 
later.

Red, White and 
Blue Theme Used 
In Gymnasium
The Annual Armistice Dance 
held last Saturday night in the 
men’s gymnasium marked the 
Evening College of Fine Arts’ first 
major social event of the season.
Excellent music supplied by 
Rusty Williams and his band 
“Rhythms by Williams” created 
such a good impression on our jit- 
ter-minded friends during a pre­
vious occasion that our committee 
brought them back for a return 
engagement.
This dance is one of the oldest 
traditions on the Evening School 
Calendar. The theme of the dec­
orations was a military one in 
keeping with Armistice Day, and, 
we might add, with the affairs of 
today. The Committee made use 
of the banners used the previous 
evening by the Day School Mili­
tary Ball with an “artistic” touch 
here and there. Many flags and 
banners with a patriotic color 
scheme draped the walls, well il­
luminated by the innumerable col­
ored spots. The crystal ball,-high 
in the ceiling, a landmark of all 
dances, picked up the reflections 
on its mirrored surface.
Another interesting note was the 
presentation of rose corsages and 
attractive Arts Dance programs to 
the first two hundred couples. We 
hope the latecomers were not too 
disappointed.
The large gymnasium provided 
ample dancing room, and Rusty 
Williams had sufficient swing and 
versatility for all types of danc­
ing. Everyone met and danced 
with old friends, and an excellent 
time was had by all who attended.
In charge of the Dance were the 
officers of the Fine Arts College: 
Fred Fargotstein, President, John 
DeLuca, Vice President, Lou Fos- 
ner, Secretary and Bob Metcalf, 
Treasurer, and the Social Com- 
tee under the direction of Harold 
Geilman, who last year was Sec­
retary of Fine Arts.
Councils have come and Coun­
cils have gone, and once again as 
in the past sixteen years a new 
Council has come into power to 
guide the destinies of the Night 
Student Body and to serve as their 
representatives in matters im­
portant to them, both educa­
tionally and socially.
Perhaps some will wonder what 
last year’s Student Council did 
that was of any benefit to the stu­
dents. Maybe things were a lit­
tle quiet at times. Perhaps it was 
a little diplomacy at times that 
averted what might have created 
considerable ill feeling. Never­
theless, long tell-tale minutes of 
lengthy meetings showed that an 
honest attempt was made to serve 
the students.
One of the finest things that 
was done was an attempt to bring 
closer together the governing 
groups of the Evening and Day 
Student Councils and the Pitt Eve­
ning Student Association. The 
former was most important be­
cause both groups are on the same 
campus and matters important to 
both quite frequently arise.
It has been the purpose of the
Council during the past few years 
to attempt to bring about a more 
agreeable feeling between the two 
bodies and to work together as a 
group when occasion called for it.
The much awaited occasion 
finally arrived and committees 
were appointed by each group to 
work together. The results of 
these meetings showed that in the 
day school there are many stu­
dents much like ourselves, who 
feel that even though we go to 
school by night and they by day, 
there should be a mutual under­
standing and closer banding-to­
gether of both student groups. 
Those who worked on the com- 
mitee were amazed by the will­
ingness and eagerness shown by 
the Day Student Council commit­
tee in wanting to work with us.
The progress made by the out­
going group within the past month 
has shown possibilities of what 
can be accomplished. .Now a new 
Council, unfamiliar with what has 
transpired within recent weeks, 
has been officially established in 
office for the coming year. A 
suggestion was made, but was flat-

ly rejected, that two of the old 
Council members might be on a 
committee with members of the 
new Council to continue the work 
just begun, until the new group 
became familiar with the work re­
cently started.
What has been conscientiously 
done, can easily be undone, and 
it might be a good thing to remem­
ber that good-will is created and 
not bought.
