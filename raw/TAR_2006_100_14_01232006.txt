Carnegie Mellon President Jared L. Cohon addressed 
an audience January 16 on the status of campus diversity. 
“In addition to understanding our [current] problems, 
we have also made some concrete progress,” Cohon said. 
However, according to findings from a recent national
study, CMU may have more work ahead than expected to 
increase diversity on campus.
The James Irvine Foundation, a non-profit group in San 
Francisco, performed the study “in response to the increas­
ing number of students who fall into the ‘race/ethnicity 
unknown’ category of post-secondary demographic data.” 
According to the study, the “other” race category typically 
found on the standard college admissions application 
might be a source of inconsistency between reported and

actual campus demographics.
“Our findings suggest that, overall, a sizeable portion 
of students in the ‘unknown’ category are white,” stated 
the James Irvine Foundation, “in addition to multiracial 
students who may have selected white as one of their 
categories.” The foundation conducted the study after 
gathering and comparing data from a survey of three

Men’s basketball enjoys 
hoop dream season
by Colin Liotta
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon has long been 
known as being one of the top 
universities for computer science 
and business, but now the school 
can add another honor to that list: 
a nationally ranked basketball 
team.
The Tartan men have been hav­
ing one of their best seasons in 
decades, setting new records and 
climbing up the national rankings. 
As of press time, the Tartans were 
ranked number 11 in the country 
according to D3Hoops.com. At 
14-2, they’ve gotten off to their 
best start in school history, in­
cluding an upset win over Princ­
eton University’s Tigers.
Going into their December 
28 matchup against the Tar­
tans, Princeton was 27-0 against 
Division III teams, and despite a 
losing record of 2-7, the Tigers’ 
record against Division III oppo­
nents spoke for itself.
But Carnegie Mellon came 
ready to play, despite not having 
played for 17 days. The Tartans 
trailed 32-29 at the half but ral­
lied in the second half of the 
game to pull off the upset, beating
Princeton 51-46. “If it’s not the 
biggest win for us, it ranks right 
up with the biggest,” said Tartans 
coach Tony Wingen.
The Tartans also ended UAA 
opponent Rochester’s winning 
streak in early December. The 
Rochester Yellowjackets had not 
lost a conference game at home 
in 23 contests until the Tartans 
defeated them 72-71. It was the 
Tartans’ first win at Rochester 
since 1996.
Meanwhile, the team’s success 
has become contagious on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus. “A na­
tionally ranked basketball team 
is a new experience for CMU, and 
it’s a great one,” said university 
president Jared Cohon. “We’re 
very proud of Coach Wingen and 
.,the men’s team.”
Happy with their progress, the 
players attribute their success to 
the team chemistry they have de­
veloped. “This has definitely been 
an unbelievable season for us,” 
said junior guard Brad Matta. “I 
can’t remember a season where 
I had such great teammates. We 
all look forward to practicing and 
playing alongside one another.”

Hurricane Katrina’s wrath 
hit land so hard that non­
profit organizations and gov­
ernment officials still have 
a massive rebuilding effort 
going on. At the beginning of 
January, nine CMU students 
flew south to help the effort 
along.
This trip was the first ven­
ture of a new student orga­
nization called Alternative
Break. Nuveen Marwah, a fifth- 
year student majoring in business 
administration, international re­
lations, and Spanish, organized 
the expedition because he felt the 
area needed the group’s efforts 
badly. “So many do not realize the 
extent of the damage,” he said.
On January 3, Alternative 
Break sent, its members to Bay St. 
Louis, a coastal Mississippi town 
with a population of about 8000. 
“I’m sure that no one who went 
had heard of Bay St. Louis before 
the trip,” Marwah said. “Some 
prospective applicants pulled out
after they found out we were not 
going to New Orleans.”
“Brad Miller, one of our 
members, went to New Orleans 
a few days before the rest of 
us flew in,” Marwah said. “He 
told one person there where 
he was going, and the person 
responded, ‘Why? There’s noth­
ing left there.’”

dents and Alternative Break advi­

fellow of New House, worked

CMU to initate fundraising campaign
by Michael R. Fitzgerald
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon is scouring 
the earth for individuals will­
ing to match the generosity of 
its namesakes. The Pittsburgh 
Tribune-Review reported on 
December 26, that the Uni­
versity has undertaken an 
ambitious, yet-to-be-named 
global fundraising campaign. 
Vice-President of University 
Advancement Robbee Kosak 
confirmed these reports, claim­
ing that the money is being 
raised, primarily from alumni, 
in an attempt to improve finan­
cial aid, increase research fund­
ing, and provide appropriate fa­
cilities for faculty and students.
As of December 25, Carnegie 
Mellon had received 32 gifts of 
more than $1 million and raised 
$258 million over the course 
of about three years of prelimi­
nary fund-hunting, according 
to Kosak.
Concluding in 1999, the last 
campaign effort raised $410 mil­
lion, University Provost Mark 
Kamlet told The Tartan.
According to Kamlet, the cur­
rent effort, as well as the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh’s $1 billion 
“Discover a World of Possibilities” 
capital campaign, should have a 
significant impact on the city of 
Pittsburgh.
“It will enhance Pittsburgh’s 
ability to be a magnet for knowl­
edge workers,” said Kamlet. “That 
is going to have to be a key part of
the Pittsburgh region’s growth 
as we look to the future.”
The University is not pre­
pared to announce a final goal 
for the campaign at a time when 
24 colleges and universities in 
the U.S. have fundraising goals 
of at least $1 billion. The Uni­
versity will probably wait until 
mid-2008 to announce a figure 
and a theme for the campaign, 
according to Kamlet.
According to Kosak, the 
Tribune-Review incorrectly 
reported that University of­
ficials are considering a goal 
of roughly $1 billion. “You 
never want to announce a fi­
nal goal until you are at least 
50 percent of the way to that

Campus 
celebrates 
MLK Day
by Michael M. Whiston
Staffwriter
“This little light of mine, I’m 
gonna let it shine,” sang the pro­
cession in the University Center 
honoring the life and vision of 
Martin Luther King, Jr.
Last Monday’s on-campus 
events centered on a common 
theme: Racial difference is a con­
tinuing struggle in today’s society 
solvable by acceptance and unifi­
cation.
Carnegie Mellon University 
President Jared Cohon set the 
stage for the day’s events in his 
“State of Diversity” address. “We 
can do more than we have to at­
tract minorities to grades 13 
through [16],” he said.
Cohon also honored particu­
lar students, faculty, and staff for 
their contributions to a campus 
life rich in diversity. “Every aspect 
of student life has been something 
that this University has invested 
in aggressively and substantially,” 
he said.
Music and poetry showcased 
the personal influence of King’s 
message of equality on students. 
Winners of the Martin Luther King 
writing competition read aloud 
their prose and poems on racial 
issues, conveying the impact 
racial difference still has. The 
Christian gospel group Joyful 
Noise held a concert in the Univer­
sity Center’s Alumni Lounge, and 
Patina Miller brought melody to 
King’s message of hope and liberty 
at the closing assembly with the 
song “Lift Every Voice.”
Panelist voices filled McConomy 
Auditorium in addressing contro­
versial racial issues in the after- 
math of Hurricane Katrina. Topics 
included the effect of race on the 
efficiency of rescue efforts and 
possible sources of racial discrimi­
nation.

Second
Summit
gathers
by Claire Morgenstern
Staffwriter
If one day can change your life, 
then the three days of Summit 
should be more than enough. The 
second annual Summit was held 
January 12-14 on campus and 
offered a program with opportuni­
ties to experience new things that 
can’t be found in any curriculum.
Students, faculty, and staff 
interacted through a series of 
courses, seminars, and workshops 
taught by their classmates and 
colleagues. This year, participants 
had the chance to hone their skills 
in everything from cooking and 
knitting to gun shooting, sign lan­
guage, handwriting analysis, and 
more.
Alumnus Roger Ma founded 
and planned the first Summit last 
year. He proposed his idea for 
the Fifth Year Scholars program, 
which allows students to remain 
at Carnegie Mellon for an addi­
tional year following graduation. 
During this extra year, students 
are given the opportunity to take 
courses unrelated to their major

ARCO celebrates Chinese New Year
Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture (ARCC) celebrated Chinese New Year with a dinner in 
Rangos last Friday. The dinner attracted over 120 students and faculty in celebration of the 
upcoming Year of the Dog. The sold-out event included authentic home-made Chinese cuisine, 
musical performances, and a lion dance.
StatisticallySpeaking
In the last four years, the government's tax cuts and increased spend­
ing have caused a disappearing budget surplus and a prevailing 
budget deficit. Now, the public debt is equal to 64.7 percent of the 
United States’ gross domestic product. Are we spending too much 
for our own good?

The New Year brought a number 
of changes for The Tartan. With our 
leadership positions lasting one calen­
dar year, The Tartan begins 2006 with 
an almost entirely new editorial staff 
— perhaps the most eager and well- 
prepared group of new editors and 
managers the paper has seen in many 
years. Columnist Bill Vaughan once 
wrote that on New Year’s Eve, “An op­
timist stays up until midnight to see 
the new year in. A pessimist stays up 
to make sure the old year leaves.” I’d 
be willing to bet that this new editorial 
staff stayed up just out of anticipation 
of their new roles becoming official on 
January 1.
While most of the editorial staff po­
sitions have been filled with eager new 
members of the CMU community, I be­
gin a second year in my role at The Tar­
tan with only a nominal change. The 
tide of this position had been Execu­
tive Officer, but many of our readers 
and business partners found the title 
to be confusing and unfamiliar. Now 
titled Publisher, this leadership role 
remains the same: chief executive of 
The Tartan with final jurisdiction over 
non-content decisions. As I understand 
it, my charge is to ensure that The Tar­
tan has everything it needs in terms of 
staffing, finances, partnerships, and 
otherwise — and to publish the best 
newspaper possible.
You’ve probably noticed that The 
Tartan is without a Sports section this 
week — terrible timing, considering 
the exciting basketball season ahead. 
Go Tartans! During the winter break, 
our newly elected sports editor Co­
lin Liotta learned that a number of 
publishing houses were looking at his 
newest book. Wanting to focus on this 
exciting opportunity, Colin stepped 
down from his post. We have not yet 
found a new sports editor, but we will 
do our best to cover important sports 
news as we continue our search.
Also, our advertising manager Erika 
Matsumoto has stepped down to focus 
on her new role as president of the 
Taiwanese Student Association. I ex­
tend my thanks to Colin and Erika and 
wish them the best of luck. If you are 
interested in either of these leadership 
positions, please e-mail personnel@ 
thetartan.org.
We begin this semester looking for­
ward to exciting new developments. 
Today, we launch a new, more usable 
interface for our website thanks to the 
great work of The Tartan’s past online 
editor Jim Puls and new online editor 
Marshall Roch. The site is more read­
able, and it will be growing through­
out the semester to include a stack of 
new features that I know you’re going 
to love. From the redevelopment of our 
course scheduler to an online directory 
of restaurants and businesses in Pitts­
burgh, we’ve got great things in store 
for your online experience.
Also coming to fruition in less than 
a few weeks is a charitable initiative 
called the Bargain Steelers Card. Sean 
Weinstock and Shabnam Aggarwal 
created the BSC to give students great 
deals at restaurants and shops all over 
Oakland, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill. 
It’ll pay for itself if you use it once, and 
with all of the proceeds going to sup­
port worldwide disaster relief efforts, 
this is a fantastic enterprise. I’m ex­
cited The Tartan was able to partner 
with Sean and Shab. Look for sales 
tables on February 1.
All of us are very excited to have the 
privilege to create your newspaper. We 
see our jobs as essential to a successful 
community. Not only does a newspaper 
inform the members of a community 
about the important issues that affect 
their lives, it gives the members of a 
community common ground . Any two 
strangers probably have something 
in common, but they might never 
know it. When two strangers are sit­
ting in Kirr Commons reading the 
newspaper, they already know they 
have something in common. It’s sub­
tle, but I believe this effect is real and 
important. We’re all very honored to 
have the chance to serve you in this 
way. From all of us on staff, thanks for 
your continued support.

Students commemorate MLK’s civil rights struggle 2uo5@ petUsC dDJfoC
5tmneCtu@ tUuh LonCuthU
Luther King Day in McConomy last Monday. Among the topics the panel addressed was the learned nature of racial discrimination.
MLK, from Al
of Greater Pittsburgh, there was 
no viable excuse for the time 
lapse between the hurricane and 
clean-up efforts.
James Perry, editor of Black 
Collegian magazine, added that 
forcing people into a commu­
nity isn’t a good plan because 
the problems of racial discrimi­
nation are not based upon intel­
lect. Racial discrimination “is not
controlled by logic,” Perry said.
The panel also discussed the 
learned nature of racial discrimi­
nation— that people are taught 
rather than predisposed to look 
at colored men and women dif­
ferently.
“We’re not born racist — we’re 
taught racist,” Golden said.
Cyril Wecht, Allegheny Coun­
ty’s medical examiner, similarly 
acknowledged that racism is a 
result of environment and not of
inheritance.
The day culminated in ad­
dresses by senior Omar Parris- 
Dione and guest speaker Der­
rick Bell. Speaking about per­
sonal struggles growing up, 
Parris-Dione bolstered King’s 
message that people should 
judge a man by his actions in 
times of distress, not those in 
times of plenty.
“We can continue [King’s] 
legacy through perseverance ...
through realizing that we will 
be measured through our times 
of challenge and controversy,” 
Parris-Dione said.
Bell conveyed a similar mes­
sage of action over complacency. 
“King was a humble man.... 
Feeding the hungry, housing the 
homeless ... all these would have 
been his mission,” he said. “The 
challenge of our lives is the rec­
ognition of evil and the determi­
nation to take action.”
Summit starts semester with alternative curriculum
SUMMIT, from A1
while giving back to the campus 
community through a substan­
tial, year-long project.
“So many people come to 
school with a special talent that 
they want to teach and other stu­
dents want to learn, and Summit 
allows students to do that,” said 
Ma about his motivation behind 
the project.
Dave Rice, Summit co-presi- 
dent and a senior mechanical 
engineering major, praised the 
program for bringing people 
together before the start of the
semester while giving them 
a greater appreciation of the 
diverse skills and talents of the 
campus community.
“Because of Summit ... I can 
see that people at CMU really do 
take an interest in things outside 
of their major — whether it’s fur­
niture making or glassblowing, 
or whether they’re a mechani­
cal engineer or a CFA student,” 
Rice said.
Board members aren’t the only 
ones enthusiastic about Summit. 
“[The program] gives students a 
chance to learn new things that 
they wouldn’t get the chance to
learn otherwise,” said sopho­
more chemical engineering 
major Chad Pugh. “I got to see 
Phantom of the Opera, visit the 
Pittsburgh Glass Center, and tour 
the Mattress Factory.”
As Ma noted, Summit also 
gives students the opportunity 
to interact with professors and 
other students of different col­
leges through exploring common 
interests. “Summit gives you an 
opportunity to experience activi­
ties in a risk-free environment,” 
Ma said.
However, Ma’s original venture
— to come up with a way for stu­
dents to explore other interests 
outside of their majors during 
the semester — became more 
than students and faculty having 
fun and learning new skills.
Participants also came away 
with a much deeper under­
standing of the talents of fel­
low members of the Carnegie 
Mellon community. “I now have 
a greater appreciation of a lot of 
other skills that people can learn 
and teach,” Rice said.
This year’s Summit was made 
possible through funding from 
the Student Senate and the 
Office of Student Development.
DIVERSITY, from A1
private colleges in California. The 
foundation then compared the 
survey data to data attained from 
U.S. Department of Education’s 
Integrated Postsecondary Educa­
tion Data System (IPED), which 
collects student data from all uni­
versities.
Results showed that in one of 
the colleges, the number of stu­
dents classifying themselves as 
white rose to 70 percent after 
they were admitted, compared 
to only 42 percent beforehand. 
Meanwhile, the proportion of stu­
dents of unknown race dropped 
from 32 percent to 4 percent.
The results of the study were 
significant enough to suggest that 
inaccurate student demograph­
ics may be a growing trend for 
universities across the country, 
making efforts to increase diver­
sity on campuses even more chal­
lenging.
On Carnegie Mellon’s cam­
pus, the state of diversity has 
been closely followed since 1999 
when Cohon created the Diver­
sity Advisory Council. In its 2006 
annual report, the DAC stated,
as chair to the undergraduate 
student work group that helped to 
gather statistical data on CMU’s 
undergraduate student popula­
tion. “President Cohon has often 
reminded us that increasing the 
diversity of all facets of our cam­
pus community is a strategic ob­
jective for his administration,” 
said Garrett. “Most of us would 
question how we could educate 
an effective business leader, en­
gineer, or social scientist without 
providing them such a diverse en­
vironment.”
According to the DAC’s 2006 
report, CMU’s undergraduate en­
rollment of minority students is 
improving. “White American stu­
dents, typically thought of as the 
majority, are now slightly fewer in 
numbers than international and 
minority undergraduates com­
bined,” the report stated. “There 
has been a significant change in 
the composition of the under­
graduate student body over the 
last decade.”
However, the findings of the 
recently performed study by the 
James Irvine Foundation could 
have implications on CMU’s true 
demographic status. Students of
“Our findings suggest that, 
overall, a sizeable portion of 
students inthe‘unknown’category 
are white, in addition to multiracial 
students who may have selected 
white as one of their categories.”

opportunity cost,” Garrett said.

season
BASKETBALL, from A1
beginning to see the results of this 
teamwork firsthand.
In a match against NYU on Jan­
uary 8 in New York, the Tartans 
went in with an 11-1 record. The 
Violets of NYU were undefeated at 
the start of the game with a record 
of 11-0. The two teams fought 
it out in regulation, but needed 
double overtime to determine a 
winner.
With the Tartans leading 87-85 
in double overtime with only sec­
onds remaining, junior forward 
Greg Gonzalez made two free 
throws to preserve a huge win for 
the Tartans.
The game also saw the record­
ing of senior co-captain Clayton 
Barlow-Wilcox’s 1000th career 
point.
Despite a 72-69 loss against 
Case Western Reserve on Fri­
day night in Skibo Gymnasium, 
the size of the crowd in atten­
dance proved the Tartans’ success 
has not gone unnoticed.
The Tartans brought home a 
victory yesterday against Emory, 
winning 96-88.

CMU plans fundraising venture: needs room to grow
Violetta Zharov, a sophomore business major and member of Alternative 
Break, cleans out the ceiling of a home in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.
She cited a Challenge Grant 
from the National Endowment 
for the Humanities that has 
been offered to the Univer­
sity. The grant is pending, as it 
will only be awarded if the 
school raises significantly more 
money for the humanities from 
private sources.
Overall, the University ap­
pears to have been paying closer 
attention to marketing and 
media relations, alumni rela­
tions, and fundraising. Cohon 
and the Board of Trustees 
recently invested the increased 
money in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Advancement Organization.
“We are quickly establishing close 
relationships with various multi­
national science and technology 
company offices in China.”
-Robbee Kosak
Kamlet and Kosak are also 
looking for an increased role 
from alumni and corporations 
in Asia.
“We are quickly establishing 
close relationships with vari­
ous multinational science and 
technology company offices in 
China,” Kosak said.
Asia has become a primary 
international target for alumni 
relations; Bryan Tamburro, head 
of international development, 
told the Tribune-Review in a 
December 26 article that most of 
Carnegie Mellon’s international 
alumni are from Asia.
In some cases, though, these 
international efforts can be prob­
lematic, as Kosak noted, “Most 
other countries’ tax laws have 
not provided the tax incentives 
that the U.S. has for giving.”
CAMPAIGN, from Al
goal,” said Kosak.
Some key contributions 
thus far include the David and 
Marlene Tepper gift of $55 mil­
lion to support the business 
school, and the Gates Foundation 
gift of the Gates Center for 
Computer Science.
Current contributions also 
include funding for the campus- 
based General Motors Collabora­
tive Research Lab from General 
Motors, and Intel’s funding of 
the Intel Research Pittsburgh lab 
that opened in 2002.
While these gifts are geared 
toward the University’s science 
programs, Kosak added, “We are 
being equally aggressive about 
raising money for the arts and 
humanities.”
BREAK, from Al
for four days. A local church that 
worked independently for the 
storm-torn community served 
as home base for the Carnegie 
Mellon students.
Alternative Break participants 
pulled furniture and drywall out 
of four mold-infested houses 
and spoke with the homeown­
ers about the disaster. Accord­
ing to Marwah, the homeowners 
whom Alternative Break helped 
had trouble with insurance com­
panies.
But the homeowners have 
had to deal with more than the 
agencies. “The government is 
not progressing in many ways,” 
said Joseph Phillips, a senior 
history major. For Phillips, the 
experience provided more ques­
tions than answers.
“The President came into New 
Orleans and said that progress 
has been made. But that doesn’t 
give justice to the amount of work 
that is left,” Marwah agreed.
Phillips expressed great respect 
for the victims who came back to
their homes in Bay St. Louis. “I 
asked them how they had the for­
titude to come back and try to re­
build — some came back to only a 
concrete slab,” he said. “They had 
a fervor for their communities.”
Alternative Break is planning 
another trip for spring break. 
Participants will help non-profit 
organizations in the San Diego 
and Tijuana areas with Mexican 
immigrants for a week.
“I hope that every student on 
campus can partake in experi­
ences like this,” said Smith.
Support from the Tepper School 
of Business, Student Senate, Stu­
dent Development, Vice-Provost 
Indira Nair, and Dean Jennifer 
Church helped to make January’s 
Alternative Break possible.
Photos and videos of the Bay 
St Louis trip along with infor­
mation about future Alterna­
tive Break trips can be found at 
their website: www.andrew.cmu. 
edu/~altbreak. On Monday, 
February 13, at 4:30 pm, a docu­
mentary of their winter break trip

Welcome to a whole new year 
of How Things Work! Being 
mindful of your break-induced 
lack of mental acuity, I’ve de­
cided to write about something 
simple: nothing! Specifically, 
I’m referring to aerogels, the 
world’s least dense solids. To 
put that into perspective, the 
newspaper you are holding is 
about 200 times denser than 
most aerogels.
Aerogels are solids resem­
bling a tinted glass or trans­
parent plastic. Though they 
are rightfully gels, their name 
is misleading: Instead of a 
jiggly, wobbling mass of Cosby- 
endorsed deliciousness, they 
behave more like hard foam. 
Their physical properties are 
broadly classified under col­
loids, fine particles suspended 
in a continuous medium. If that 
sounds confusing, just visualize 
aerogels as microscopic mix­
tures of a solid structure and 
air, like that of styrofoam.
The most common aerogels 
are made of silica, a compound 
of silicon and oxygen. Other 
continuous media include car­
bon, metal oxides, cellulose, 
and agar. Though diverse, these 
substances have the common 
ability to form rigid, three-di- 
mensional networks of atoms. 
The choice of medium, then, 
depends simply on what physi­
cal characteristics are desired.
The physical characteristics 
of aerogels are truly remark­
able. When Steven Kistler in­
vented the first silica aerogels 
in the 1930s, he found that 
they had amazing potential 
as insulators. Aerogels can ef-
Over time, the liquid carbon di­
oxide soaks into the gel, and the 
previous continuous medium is 
replaced.
The autoclave is then heated 
and pressurized over the criti­
cal temperature and pressure, 
where the superfluid carbon 
dioxide escapes easily from the 
gel. The newly formed aero­
gel is ready for processing into 
forms like pure blocks, appli­
cable coatings, or even woven 
fabrics.
The versatility of aerogels has 
led to some interesting applica­
tions. In the 1940s, they were 
marketed as thickening agents 
for paints, cosmetics, and even 
napalm. As competing thicken­
ers became cheaper, aerogels 
were largely forgotten until the 
1970s. It was then that research 
was revived and many applica­
tions were marketed.
Aerogels are well-suited to 
insulating objects in extreme 
conditions, such as the elec­
tronics of the Mars rovers and 
winter gear for scientists in 
the Antarctic. Recently, aero­
gel was successfully employed 
in the Stardust probe to col­
lect the particles from the tail 
of a comet. Soon, we may 
even be seeing aerogel in 
our homes. One aerogel win­
dow is so insulating that it is 
equivalent to about 20 tradi­
tional windows stacked to­
gether.
Commercial products are 
becoming smaller, lighter, and 
cheaper. Therefore, the need 
for them to be efficient becomes 
larger and larger. Aerogels are 
sure to be at the forefront of this 
-drive. Never since Seinfeld has 
nothing been more important!

Pluto!
On Thursday, NASA’s New Ho­
rizons spacecraft blasted off into 
space on a 10-year, three-billion- 
mile mission to Pluto. It will take 
New Horizons nine years to reach 
Pluto. Its mission is to capture up- 
close images of Pluto, its moons, 
and the Kuiper Belt, a region of 
the outer solar system. If success­
ful, New Horizons will be the first 
mission to be up close and per­

Chocolate’s benefits
Research reveals that a chemi­
cal known as epicatechin found in 
chocolate is beneficial to the car­
diovascular system and blood cir­
culation. The study was based on 
the Kuna Indians, who consume 
three to four cups of flavanol-rich 
cocoa a day. High blood pressure 
and other cardiovascular diseases 
áre rare among the Kuna Indians. 
Their blood contained higher lev­
els of nitric oxide, which resulted 
in healthier blood flow through 
the arteries. Also, flavanols allow 
vascular tissue to relax. Mean­
while, the Kuna Indians who 
only consumed about four cups 
of cocoa per week did not have 
the same levels of cardiovascular 
health.

Deadly bugs and the 
avian flu
Metapneumovirus. Rhinovirus. 
Parainfluenza. Sound deadly? 
While fears of the avian flu 
are affecting everyone around 
the globe, the risk of death by 
other infectious diseases is right 
around the corner. These vi­
ruses live on objects like faucets, 
door handles, and change from 
the coffee shop. No one in the 
Western Hemisphere has yet 
contracted the strain of avian flu 
strain being spread in Eastern 
countries. On the other hand, 
strains of other flu viruses are 
likely to kill more than 35,000 
U.S. residents this year.

Chemicals accumu­
lating in polar bears
According to Canada’s National 
Water Institute, polar bears are 
one of the planet’s most contami­
nated organisms. The toxic chem­
icals used in flame retardants are 
carried to the Arctic via wind and 
ocean currents. These chemicals 
accumulate in the fatty tissue of 
animals. As bigger animals eat 
smaller contaminated animals, 
the toxic chemicals become more 
concentrated at the top .of the 
food chain. Industrial chemicals 
have been shown to weaken im­
mune systems, damage the bone 
structure, disrupt sex hormones, 
and worse. Many cubs are con­
taminated by their mothers’ milk 
and die. A framework has already 
been established to spread and 
help the polar bears globally.

How Things Work: Aerogel
fectively insulate many forms 
of energy, including physical 
force, acoustic energy, electric­
ity, and heat. They also have a 
very large microscopic surface 
area. One measly gram of silica 
aerogel has a surface area four 
times the size of the Cut! These 
properties have potential in 
many obvious and not-so-obvi- 
ous applications.
Of course, before a product’s 
potential can be realized, it has 
to be produced! When Kistler 
invented aerogel, he wasn’t 
searching for a substance with 
such amazing properties. In­
stead, he was looking for a 
method to remove the liquid 
component of a gel. If the liquid 
component is allowed to evapo­
rate, the gel will significantly 
shrink and crack. The tough 
skin on old cafeteria Jell-0 is
an early stage of this evapora­
tion. These negative effects are 
caused by the liquid forcing its 
way out of the gel, through a 
type of surface tension called 
capillary action.
Kistler found a way to avoid 
this: supercritical drying. If a 
liquid is heated and pressur­
ized beyond a certain point, it 
becomes a supercritical fluid. 
Such fluids are important to 
the production of aerogels 
because they diffuse through 
solids like a gas, preventing the 
gel from shrinking and crack­
ing. What remains is a torturous 
maze of branching molecules 
with many pores and voids 
that fill with air. So much air, in 
fact, that some aerogels are 99.8 
percent gas. And you thought I 
was full of hot air!
The actual processing steps
vary and are chemistry-inten­
sive, so describing them here 
would make this article about 
2000 times denser than aerogel. 
Nevertheless, most processes 
follow a general procedure. 
First, the continuous medium is 
mixed with water and allowed 
to bond, or polymerize. This so­
lution is left alone to set into an 
alcogel. This step is analogous 
to making Jell-O.
After the structure of the 
alcogel has strengthened, it 
is placed in a pressure vessel 
known as an autoclave. The 
autoclave is connected to a liq­
uid capable of becoming super­
critical at a certain temperature 
and pressure. Carbon dioxide 
is often used because it is safe, 
cheap, and convenient. The liq­
uid is pumped into the cham­
ber, submersing the alcogel.

Green chemistry event a huge success
Pittsburgh’s First Night Celebration raises environmental awareness
CMU scientist to build mass spectrometer with NSF funding
by Sean Conroy
Staffwriter
When most people think of a 
chemistry lab, they imagine bea­
kers of smoky green liquid, Bun­
sen burners, and the occasional 
explosion. Mark Bier’s lab looks 
more like the engine room of 
the starship Enterprise. Located 
on the top floor of the Mellon 
Institute, the lab’s main features 
are three giant mass spectrom­
eters, all built in part by Bier. 
These machines are used to mea­
sure the mass of extraordinarily 
small particles, and Bier’s spe­
cialty is pushing the envelope of 
how massive a molecule he can 
measure.
In fact, Bier, director of the
Center for Molecular Analysis in 
the Department of Chemistry, 
is so good that the National Sci­
ence Foundation’s Instrument 
Development for Biological Re­
search program has recently 
granted him $546,000 to build 
a novel mass spectrometer. At 
most, “mass-specs” can measure 
particles in the kiloDalton mass 
range. Bier’s proposal is for a 
novel machine that could mea­
sure molecules in the megaDal- 
ton mass range.
According to a January 10 
CMU press release, Bier is very 
excited about the potential of 
this new technology in a variety 
of fields. “This is a new frontier 
in mass spectrometry research. 
We anticipate that this work 
will help to advance research in
proteomics, virology, molecular 
biology and nanotechnology.”
Mass spectrometers are used 
to determine the weight, struc­
ture, and composition of mole­
cules. These machines are best at 
measuring masses on the atomic 
level. Due to the physics of their 
design, the larger the mass of the 
particle in question, the worse 
the performance. Thus chem­
ists and biologists who seek to 
understand molecules of larger 
size and complexity, such as pro­
teins and viruses, are forced to 
break these molecules into much 
smaller pieces. This “bottom-up” 
approach is both time-consuming 
and inaccurate.
With his new mass spectrom­
eter, Bier hopes to enable a “top- 
down” approach to molecular
analysis. A scientist initially ana­
lyzes the intact particle, and then 
breaks it into smaller pieces for 
further investigation. This tech­
nique reduces sample loss and 
provides a powerful new research 
tool for scientists to characterize 
large molecules such as proteins 
with masses over 150 kiloDaltons
— about twice the mass of the 
hemoglobin molecule.
To communicate the signifi­
cance of this project, Bier calls 
his quest “Project Flora,” after 
Flora, a “flying” African circus 
elephant. The name was sug­
gested by a colleague who noted 
the similarity between a flying 
elephant and the particles Bier 
proposes to measure. Bier now 
keeps a picture of Flora in the 
front of his logbook.
Bier has already made a large 
contribution to the field of 
mass spectroscopy. Before com­
ing to CMU, Bier worked for the 
Thermo Electron Corporation, 
where he co-invented the linear 
ion trap. The linear ion trap was 
a breakthrough over older ion 
traps because it was faster and of­
fered improved sensitivity. Bier’s 
invention was commercialized 
in 2002, and is now used around 
the world.
Now Bier hopes to push the

Carnegie Mellon’s top green chemistry 
scientists put on an interactive New Year’s 
event at the First Night Celebration in 
downtown Pittsburgh. Over 1000 children 
had the opportunity to participate in green 
chemistry by being taught how to clean 
water using safe, biodegradable chemical 
reagents.
Colin Horwitz, a research professor and 
deputy director of the Institute for Green 
Oxidation Chemistry at CMU, was con­
tacted by the Three Rivers Arts Festival 
and asked to organize and design a fun 
experiment for children. A water-cleaning 
experiment seemed like the perfect idea. 
Horwitz designed a hands-on, safe, and 
fun experiment for children between the 
ages of eight and 12. He enlisted the help of 
several CMU professors and graduate stu­
dents, and received donations from a vari­
ety of. companies, including the American 
Chemical Society and Fisher Scientific.
“I think a lot of people just don’t know 
what happens at CMU,” said Horwitz. 
“There was such a diverse crowd — this 
really impacted people from the region. I 
was proud we could show the community 
something fun from CMU.”
The experiment consisted of three 
bottles containing different liquids. The 
first contained water and a dye, repre­
senting a model pollutant. The other two

Children enjoy CMU-designed water experiment
Yan Xiang, visiting researcher in Dr. Terry Collins’ lab at the Institute for Green Oxidation, explains the Fe- 
TAML based experiment to a child participating in First Night Celebration.
GREEN, from A9
bottles contained hydrogen 
peroxide and Fe-TAML cata­
lyst, the key player. The experi­
menter had to add the two sol­
utions to the contaminated wa­
ter bottle and shake it up. The 
dye would disappear and it 
would look like normal water! 
Quite an amazing phenomenon 
for young children.
“The kids were just amazed,” 
said Greg Lowry, a professor in 
the Department of Civil & Envi­
ronmental Engineering. Lowry 
volunteered on First Night and 
helped the children run the ex­
periment and understand how 
it works. “The line was already
out the door, and around the 
corner before we even opened. 
The number of kids that showed 
up was phenomenal, and many 
even repeated the experiment 
several times.”
“I enjoy working with chil­
dren, and I think it is great to get 
kids excited about science, and 
especially green chemistry,” said 
Melanie Ann Vrabel, a graduate 
student. Vrabel volunteered at 
the event and distributed “give­
aways” to the children, includ­
ing bookmarks, stickers, peri­
odic tables, experiment guides, 
and yo-yos. “Our environment is 
so important to us, and it is im­
portant to teach children about 
the environment and how we
can take care of it. They are the 
future, and they will be respon­
sible for the maintenance of our 
environment,” Vrabel said.
Hoping to solve one of the 
biggest issues of today, water 
pollution, the ground-breaking 
Fe-TAML technology was de­
veloped. The Fe-TAML catalyst 
worksbyactivatingoxidantssuch 
as hydrogen peroxide. The pur­
pose is to exchange harmful oxi­
dants and dangerous chemicals 
that can bioaccumulate in eco­
systems and foodchains with 
non-toxic, biodegradable chem­
icals. It took about 25 years to 
develop a suitable catalyst sys­
tem that had a fast enough rate 
of conversion, was economically
viable, and could work on large 
quantities of water.
“Fe-TAML technology is 
just one piece of the puzzle to 
building a sustainable civiliza­
tion,” said Vrabel. “Industries 
who generate pollution may 
turn to Fe-TAML technology as 
a method of waste treatment in 
order to release less hazardous 
substances into the environ­
ment.”
The Fe-TAML catalyst system 
will ultimately be aimed at 
cleaning large water systems 
and helping companies put out 
cleaner water. Industries of in­
terest that will benefit from this 
technology include the pulp 
and paper industry, textile dy­
ing mills, and residual pesticide 
decontamination. Other areas 
of interest in which Horwitz and 
collaborators are working to 
implement Fe-TAML include de­
activating chemical weapons, as 
well as in laundry applications 
that would prevent dye transfer 
of clothes.
“Kids need to become in­
volved in their community and 
be aware of their environment,” 
said Horwitz. “We really need to 
get the ball rolling at an earlier 
age, and give kids an apprecia­
tion of the world around them.”
The green chemistry event 
at the First Night Celebration 
was such a success that it will 
be repeated twice, by scientists 
at the University of Notting­
ham in the U.K. and at National 
Engineers Week at the Carnegie 
Science Center in February. 
Over 6500 people are expected 
to show, so come and join the 
fun!
Scientist to build innova­
tive mass spectrometer
SPECTROMETER, from A9
ribosomal particles. To the lay­
man, this may not seem remark­
able, but to Carnegie Mellon bi­
ologist John Woolford, it is very 
important. “Mark’s new genera­
tion machine might enable us to 
detect essential but small modifi­
cations of pre-ribosomes and ma­
ture ribosomes. We could do these 
experiments in much less time 
without having to fractionate the 
complexes into their many compo­
nents. Mark’s facility and his help 
and advice have significantly em­
powered biological research here 
[in Pittsburgh].” The new spec­
trometer will allow scientists like 
Woolford to better study the parts 
of ribosomes, molecules in the cell 
responsible for making proteins. 
By effectively analyzing large mol­
ecules without having to break 
them into smaller components, the 
novel machine will allow biologists 
to better study large protein and 
ribosomal complexes.
A typical mass spectrometer 
works by electrically charging 
sample particles, linearly accel­
erating them through an electric 
field, and then passing the particles 
through a magnetic field, which 
curves their path. The amount of 
path curvature is directly related 
to the mass of the particle. The key 
to Bier’s new mass spectrometer is 
the combination of a special mass 
analyzer of his own invention with 
a cutting-edge cryodetector.
Cryodetector technology, origi­
nally developed for particle physi­
cists to detect charged particles, 
was further developed by engi­
neers at Comet AG in Flamatt, 
Switzerland, for use with mass 
spectrometry. The key feature of 
this intrument is its sensitivity to 
kinetic energy instead of velocities. 
Therefore, large particles will no 
longer have to be accelerated to the 
high velocities required in a typical
The new spectrometer will allow

ecules in the cell responsible for

mass-spec, which would cause 
their disintegration. The other 
key component to Bier’s plan is a 
custom-designed mass analyzer, 
which will be used to vaporize and 
^then separate charged particles by 
their unique mass-to-charge ratio 
without destroying them.
Although Bier estimates that it 
will take at least 18 months to build 
the device, he has already started 
ordering parts. He is seeking inter­
ested science undergraduates from 
CMU to help in the machine’s con­
struction this summer.
Ultimately, Bier dreams of 
building a mass spectrometer that 
can analyze cell-sized particles. 
He admits that this will not hap­
pen for years, but given his past 
success, we might be hearing 
about something — called, per­
haps, “Project Blue Whale” — in 
the future.

Bookstore’s new return policy costs students
College textbooks are notoriously ex­
pensive; everyone knows that. Students 
do the best they can to anticipate and 
cope with stratospheric prices. But many 
students were surprised when they pur­
chased textbooks this semester and found 
that the campus bookstore had sliced its 
return period in half, from two weeks 
into the semester to one. Friday was the 
last day before all textbook sales became 
final, and for many, this is an unexpected 
and very expensive inconvenience.
CMU’s bookstore already has a strong 
reputation for putting a burdensome 
dent in students’ pockets. This recent 
policy change has only compounded the 
opinion. Now, not only are the books ex­
pensive, but after only a few class meet­
ings — when students are still working 
out their final schedules — the pur­
chase becomes a marriage: till death (or 
bottom-dollar buyback) do us part.
Couldn’t a student just wait until 
his or her class schedule is finalized to 
buy books? Possibly, but it’s a gamble. 
Classes at CMU usually hit the ground 
running, and it’s in neither the students’ 
nor professors’ best interest for students 
to spend the first week or more of class
unprepared, waiting to see whether 
they’ll get out of academic purgatory 
(a.k.a. “the waitlist”).
But, as always, there are two sides 
to this issue. It’s easy to demonize the 
bookstore for being an expensive part 
of the college experience. The truth 
is, though, that the bookstore is an 
independent business trying to stay 
competitive in a modern market. It has 
to rent its space from the University 
Center, buy books from publishers, pay 
employees, and so on. Students’ procliv­
ity to treat the bookstore like a lending 
library — purchasing books, ordering 
them less expensively online, and then 
returning the bookstore books after 
their cheaper ones arrive — has put 
a significant strain on the bookstore, 
which pays high shipping and restock­
ing fees in order to send unsold or re­
turned books back to the publisher. 
Last semester, one publisher, John 
Wiley & Sons, charged the CMU book­
store $7000 in restocking fees alone.
Moreover, the bookstore is a valu­
able participant in the CMU community. 
According to Kurt Edwards, CMU Book 
Department Manager, after covering its
own costs (such as bills and employee 
wages), the bookstore funnels its profits 
into the Student Activities Fund.
Still, the law of capitalism is clear: 
win over the consumer or perish. For in­
stance, Amazon.com can offer savings of 
about 30 percent over bookstore prices. 
When the price of a single book can soar 
into the hundreds of dollars, serious 
savings add up. By that same token, the 
bookstore’s standard 25 percent markup 
makes already expensive books unbear­
ably costly.
What, then, is the best solution? Don’t 
wait till the last minute to buy books. 
Shop around, buy used, and buy on­
line. If you haven’t sorted out your final 
classes yet, check the local libraries or 
borrow from a friend. If you wouldn’t 
buy an outfit, wear it to a party, and 
return it the next day, then try to treat 
the bookstore with the same respect. By 
doing so, students will get the best deal, 
and the bookstore’s significant shipping 
and restocking fees will be eased, result­
ing in — you guessed it — lower prices 
and a more generous return period. Until 
that time, it will continue to charge an 
arm and a leg.
UCLA alum pays students to decry professors
“Academic Bill of Rights” continues to threaten professors’ intellectual freedom
By offering cash to students for snitch­
ing on “radical” professors, a group of 
alums from the University of California, 
Los Angeles, are taking the conservative 
attack on academic freedom to a new 
low. Even conservative activist David 
Horowitz thinks “baiting” students is 
wrong, according to The Chronicle of 
Higher Education.
With a proposed amendment to the 
students’ rights policy slated to go before 
the Faculty Senate tomorrow, this new­
est attempt to chill academic freedom 
is likely to have a dramatic impact on 
students’ rights here at CMU.
As of two weeks ago, UCLA 2003 
alumnus and “Bruin Alumni Association” 
president Andrew Jones launched a 
second pet project website. His new 
UCLAProfs.com, a site dedicated to “ex­
posing UCLA’s most radical professors” 
as “proof of an increasingly radical fac­
ulty” is yet another scheme in the same 
vein as Horowitz’s so-called “Academic 
Bill of Rights.” Jones’ method? Pay cur­
rent UCLA students $100 for each profes­
sor they help to defame.
It’s not a simple task: To get your 
Benjamin, you have to provide full lec­
ture notes, all course materials, and full
tape recordings of each class. You also 
have to obtain the professor’s permission 
to record his or her class, and a UCLA 
spokesperson recently said that the cam­
pus chancellor must agree as well. Not 
able to tape your classes? No problem: 
just the lecture notes and course ma­
terials will land you $50. And if you 
just want to whistle-blow on a “problem 
professor” along with course materials, 
you’ll walk away with $10.
Jones claims he’s not funding a witch­
hunt, but you don’t need a PhD to see 
where this is going.
Profiles of 31 “radical” UCLA professors 
make up the bulk of UCLAprofs.com's 
content. The lengthy, poorly sourced 
dossiers give pejorative nicknames to 
professors, track the petitions they have 
signed, and rate them on a scale of one 
to five “black fists.” The profiles are out­
landish, whiny rants demeaning liberal 
professors.
A Chronicle of Higher Education ar­
ticle reported that Jones once even 
worked for Horowitz — writing articles 
that still appear on his online periodical 
FrontPageMagazine.com — but he was 
fired for pressuring students to file bogus 
reports on liberal professors.
The Chronicle also reported that 
Jones’ Bruin Alumni Association 
“has no connection to Students for 
Academic Freedom,” Horowitz’s con­
servative watchdog group, which has 
been lobbying state legislatures to fight 
against “liberal bias” in academia. But 
the two groups have something very 
important in common: They are both 
contributing to an environment where 
genuine initiatives to improve students’ 
rights are impossible.
Amending CMU’s students’ rights pol­
icy could fuel the fire of the Horowitz 
and Jones types; so, even if the amend­
ment has the unanimous support of the 
various constituencies at CMU, it could 
cause much more harm than good. In 
past interviews with The Tartan, both 
university president Jared Cohon and 
provost Mark Kamlet have spoken out 
against Horowitz’s bill, citing instances 
where it would prevent more liberties 
than grant them.
In effect, activists like David Horowitz 
and Andrew Jones have retarded the 
very rights they claim to defend. More 
and more, it seems like their true ambi­
tion is merely to make academia a little 
more conservative.
Good riddance to the 
holiday spirit (for now)
Matthew McKee
Next winter break, I am going to find 
a cave and hibernate. My cave, if noth­
ing else, will be far away from the holi­
day season that has turned into a vicious 
and complicated frenzy. The wholesome 
holiday spirit does not exist anymore, 
for it has been exploited and tainted.
Thomas Carlyle once predicted the 
pre-eminence of a cash nexus that 
would debase man-to-man relations, 
removing the meaning from human 
relations. Friendship, community, and 
family would become insignificant as 
humankind fell under the all-powerful 
influence of monetary transactions.
A Gallup poll found that Americans in 
2004 wanted to spend less. They aimed 
not to exhaust their wallets, but rather 
to rein in the yearly holiday spendfest. 
In fact, consumer spending over the 
holidays actually increased from 2003 
to 2004. This came from more than 
inflation; our holiday cheer now derives 
from the material. We give, and we ex­
pect to get in return.
If the holiday season is supposed to 
reject that premise and embrace the 
transcendent values over the material, 
then why has the cash nexus found 
this seasonal niche? The markets 
are swarmed with rabid consumers, 
clawing, spending, biting, and buying, 
in the name of this perverted holiday 
spirit.
NPR humorist Brian Unger identified 
the symptom of “monkey see, monkey 
buy” that pervades the holiday season. 
Shoppers will see a potential gift on 
a shelf and buy it, sometimes caus­
ing trouble on the store floor as many 
attempt to fight for the same item. 
Unger humorously suggests this is a 
counter example to “intelligent design,” 
for the scene really does look like a pack 
of wild monkeys. We have clearly not 
progressed when gift-giving turns into a 
scene from Animal Planet.
In the end, we dread December be­
cause it means trip after trip to mall 
and market to find a good present. We 
dread the primal dashes for products; 
compounded with these often painful 
encounters comes wrapping paper and 
bows. The whole process has become
needlessly complicated, but for some 
reason we cannot stop doing it.
Capitalists know that the holiday sea­
son is a good investment. Their advertis­
ing turns the holiday spirit into avarice 
every year so that the monkey scenes 
occur all over the nation. They deliber­
ately pour money into making the most 
of the fundamentally pure and simple 
inclination to make people happy.
I don’t see the concept of gift-giving as 
flawed, but I lament the monster that it 
has become. When families get together 
after ads have flooded their brains, 
their thoughts now center on what they 
have bought and what others bought 
for them. The holiday spirit’s together­
ness falls prey to materialism. What it 
has created is a lose-lose guilt situation. 
Guilt jumps in when not enough gifts 
are given, but also when too many gifts 
are given. Either you lament being a bad 
consumer or a good one. Where is the 
cheer in this?
The glee of tradition and together­
ness, the true “magic” of the holidays, 
has fled. “Cheer up, Matt, it’s almost 
Christmas,” someone tells me while I 
somberly reflect on my shopping list. 
Somehow the concept that I must vali­
date my love for another by buying 
seems skewed and misplaced. I cannot 
contribute to the cash nexus.
Instead, one of my favorite parts of 
the holidays is putting ornaments on 
our tree with siblings and sharing mem­
ories about each one. My family loves 
to have a story with each ornament, 
and even though I came home late from 
CMU, they waited for my return to chris­
ten the tree with its reminiscences. The 
tragedy comes from the consumerism 
that debases such joyful traditions.
Ultimately, my joy derived from the 
simple love of human relationships. This 
wholesomeness remains at the heart of 
my holiday spirit, and the superficiality 
created by simple jingles about bells 
and noses and mass-marketed holiday 
cheer makes the winter break a chore 
more than anything else. So, if you see 
me scouting for a good cave or log cabin 
come December, don’t be surprised.
Matthew McKee ('mmckeel@J tries 
desperately to reject his conservative 
Christian roots, but somehow always 
comes back to rants like this. He tolerates 
all responses.
What are the consequences 
of libraries going online?
Claire Morgenstern
When you step into Hunt Library, 
does it feel like you’re seeing the same 
old books on the shelves? Maybe that’s 
because you are. Out of the $1.95 bil­
lion spent on libraries in 2005, only 
10 percent, or $195.2 million, of those 
funds were spent on real live books. In 
the past decade, the number of books 
that libraries across the globe have 
to offer has also declined 10 percent. 
Despite this mass decline, employment 
has actually increased 10 percent from 
that of 10 years ago. Econ majors know 
that adding more labor is a way to foster 
growth, leading to an overall increase 
in output.
If every Hunt dweller wearing a 
library nametag could single-handedly 
conceive, write, publish, and distribute 
a book, this economic theory would 
hold true. However, the number of 
books that come in and out of the li­
brary is determined by you, the readers 
(assuming that you have ventured into 
Hunt in the first place). Each time you 
check out a book from the library, you
have effectively given one vote to that 
book. (If you still want to play econom­
ics, you are the consumer and you are 
exercising your consumer sovereignty.) 
If a book gets enough votes, it gets to 
stay on the shelf.
Each time you forgo the walk to Hunt 
and the energy expended to locate and 
procure the book, choosing instead to 
find the information through other 
means, such as the Internet, you cast 
an imaginary vote against that book, 
and it is one step closer to checking out
— for good.
Like the African wild dog, the Pony 
Express, or the human appendix, the 
library is facing eventual extinction. 
Library services are becoming less of a 
commodity and are being replaced by 
cheaper, faster, more convenient, and 
more extensive resources found via the 
Internet.
If you happen to cast more votes for 
literature on the screen than on the 
printed page, don’t stop reading. I’m 
not trying to make the Internet look like 
a burglar of the publishing industry. 
It’s only trying to break into the library 
system that once had a monopoly on the

eryone back to campus for the 
spring semester. I hope everyone 
had a restful break. I too had a 
good one, and took the time to 
reflect upon the first semester 
of my presidency. I did not re­
alize how difficult it would be 
to communicate my work to the 
student body, so Nicolette and 
I have done some thinking on 
how we can better use all forms 
of media on campus, including 
forums and discussions (such as 
the student state of diversity talk 
on February 1).
As we begin our endeavors to 
make our office more accesible to 
students, we will use this weekly 
column and other media outlets 
to inform the student body of 
our newer, more open modes of 
communication. I also realized 
that if I want to garner feedback 
and input from students, I need 
to make a bigger effort to actively 
seek out the students, rather 
than waiting for them to come to 
me with their concerns. I plan to 
devote extra time this semester to 
campus events. Please inform me 
of anything you think I should 
attend. I still can be contacted by 
e-mail (sbp@ or concerns@') or 
by phone (412-657-3953).
When Nicolette and I ran for 
office, one of the biggest issues 
we saw facing this campus was 
diversity. Granted, it was the hot- 
button topic from the election, 
but we truly believe in improving 
the state of diversity on campus. 
And we continue to work on this 
topic: I am a member of President 
Cohon’s Diversity Advisory 
Council (DAC) and worked on 
the MLK Committee; Nicolette 
has been heavily involved in the 
Multicultural Presidents Council. 
We are working as quickly as 
possible, but it is important to 
understand that improvements 
will take time, and some won’t 
happen until most of us have 
graduated.
Since making these improve­
ments will be a slow process, you 
might be wondering why I am 
writing this now. I had an amaz­
ing discussion with Dr. Bell (the 
keynote speaker on MLK Day), 
students, faculty, and community 
members that I wish everyone 
could have witnessed because it 
made such an impact on me. The 
very next day, I entered a class 
I am taking titled “Blacks and 
Jews in U.S. History,” which I 
signed up for simply because I am 
interested in history. However,
I now believe it will further en­
lighten me on diversity issues.
I encourage everyone to take a 
class like this one, one that has a 
large and diverse population. As I 
continue to study and learn from 
this issue, I will update you on 
our attempts to improve diversity 
at Carnegie Mellon.
I hope everyone has an en­
joyable and challenging spring 
semester and looks forward to 
Spring Carnival.

Can the old-fashioned library and new-fangled Internet co-exist?
LIBRARY, from A12
game of knowledge.
Not that these break-ins are necessarily 
crimes. Take the Google Library Project, 
announced by Google in December 2004. 
The project’s goal is to digitize five major 
university libraries, making all of the in­
formation each library has in print avail­
able online. Not only would you be able to 
visit the library while you’re having a loud 
conversation on your cell phone, eating an 
Italian hoagie, or naked (all conceivable in 
real life), you would be able to experience 
any or all of the above situations at five 
different universities (more difficult). And 
not only would you have access to all those 
resources, but to out-of-copyright and out- 
of-print resources as well. You’d have ac­
cess to new material the nanosecond it 
becomes available. No waiting lists, no late 
fees, no return slots.
If the Internet is really the library’s 
online equivalent, any student with this 
tool at hand would use it over trudging 
across campus and climbing four flights of 
stairs in search of a narrow fraction of the 
same material. However, every medium 
has its drawbacks. If you’re the type of 
student who likes to highlight and write 
in the margins of your books until they’re 
unrecognizable, you’re out of luck. While 
virtual text is always readily available and 
often free, it is also often un-copyable,
un-highlightable, and harder to see due 
to a computer screen’s low resolution — 
NYU’s Office of Communications posits 
that people read about 25 percent more 
slowly off a computer screen than off a 
printed page.
More importantly, if we’re all in our
pajamas doing our research at home, what 
will happen to the student camaraderie 
at the library? What about the feeling 
of being consumed by the stacks? What 
about the satisfaction of being able to 
hold in your hand the book with the exact 
information that you need? Of creasing 
the first page? Of reading the margin notes 
of others who struggled over the book like 
you’re doing now? What will happen to 
that human connection? Odds are that the 
library can find you a paper copy of any 
text that can also be found on the Internet 
and obtain it for you within a few weeks, 
but the Internet will never be able to repli­
cate the tangible relationships that readers
have with books and with each other that 
are so ingrained in library subculture.
That being said, the issue extends far 
beyond our quest to preserve our own cul­
tural heritage; the availability of material 
internationally on the Internet risks the 
loss of countless indigenous languages all
over the world. The Internet provides the 
ability to access materials published in our 
country as well as also those published in 
other countries, acting as a bigger, more 
diversified library than all the world’s li­
braries combined. With English as the 
unofficial language of the Internet, it is 
the language into which publications in 
minority languages are most often trans­
lated. So while we are gaining access to 
all the literature that is published any­
where in the world, Americans are getting 
something that seems even better — an 
Americanized version of this collection.
Here, the Internet acts as a catalyst of 
reverse globalization — instead of bring-
ing small, developing countries into closer 
contact with the larger world powers, it is 
turning those cultural contributions into 
texts that their native speakers can’t even 
understand. If media in these languages 
are not available, the world will forgo 
cultural pluralism in favor of a sterilized 
information superhighway that only runs 
through the developed world.
When your computer is the last thing 
you pack up before heading back to school 
after winter break and the first thing you 
unpack while you’re waiting for your 
flight, it’s easy to forget that there are 
some things we will never be able to access 
via the Internet. The smell of old books, 
for example, or the feel of a new cover. 
A'smooth, wooden table where you can 
write a paper (or a program) in silence. 
A real, live person who doesn’t give you a 
mechanical list of options and tell you to 
press “one” on your keypad before help­
ing you find what you’re looking for. No 
matter how comprehensive a research and 
literary tool the Internet becomes, scroll­
ing through a novel on a computer screen 
will never hold a candle to turning the 
pages with your own hands. And if we’re 
lucky, it will never have to.

year in H&SS. She welcomes all thoughtful 
replies; if you need to speak to her in person, 
she’ll be in the library.
If media in foreign languages are not available, 
the world will forgo cultural pluralism in favor

What’s one thing you hope to accomplish before leaving Carnegie Mellon?A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled by Deren Guler and Drew Hendrickson
History poised torepeat itself in radical Iran
Ben Hackett
In an address memorializing 
the 60th anniversary of the liber­
ation of a death camp in Poland, 
Pope John Paul II commented 
on the “systematic destruction 
of an entire people,” remarking 
how this destruction “falls like a 
shadow on the history of Europe 
and the whole world.” The 
Holocaust was “a crime which 
will forever darken the history of 
humanity.”
Pope John Paul II’s sentiment 
repeated a common theme among 
leaders in the post-World War II 
world. John Paul levied a warn­
ing to mankind, saying, “May it 
serve, today and for the future, 
as a warning: there must be no 
yielding to ideologies which jus­
tify contempt for human dignity 
on the basis of race, color, lan­
guage, or religion.”
These sentiments have been 
echoed since the end of World 
War II by many leaders, but 
promises are hard to make and 
even harder to keep. As the New 
Hitler rises in the Middle East, 
the question must be raised: Is 
the world ready to put forth ac­
tion, replacing easy words with 
measurable effects?
For those that find this ques­
tion intriguing, the time for an 
answer is at hand. President 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, repre­
sents the rise of a new Middle 
Eastern Reich, a state bent on 
repeating the policies of Nazi 
Germany and those of the most 
dishonorable Adolf Hider.
Before the period in which 
Nazism took hold, Germany 
touted an open society where 
there existed many gay organi­
zations, publications, and meet­
ing places. Shortly after coming 
to power in 1933, Hitler banned 
all homosexual organizations. 
This proved to be only the begin­
ning. In 1936 Heinrich Himmler 
pushed initiatives setting new 
laws against homosexual activi­

ties. These new anti-gay laws, 
combined with the zealous pros­
ecution of the laws already on the 
books, brought the persecution 
of gay men throughout Germany. 
According to most accounts, be­
tween 50,000 and 100,000 gay 
men served prison terms, their 
crime defined simply as being 
gay. Estimates of the number of 
gay men put to death in concen­
tration camps range from 10,000 
to 50,000.
Today, Doug Ireland of 
InTheseTimes.com will report 
that “the Islamic Republic of 
Iran — under the new govern­
ment of President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad — is engaged in a 
major anti-homosexual pogrom 
targeting gays and gay sex. This 
campaign includes Internet en­
trapment, blackmail to force 
arrested gays to inform on others, 
torture, and executions of those 
found guilty of engaging in ‘ho­
mosexual acts.’”
It is important to remember 
that anti-gay laws have crimi­
nalized homosexuality in Iran 
since 1979, the year that saw 
Ayatollah Khomeini come to 
power. That said, these efforts 
to crack down on gay behavior in 
Iran reached a crescendo shortly 
after the election of President 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. This 
timeline of events has an eerie 
parallel to the crackdown imme­
diately following Hitler’s rise to 
power. Killing on the basis of 
bias need not differ in its hor­
ror, yet, as Mr. Ireland reports, 
“Iranians found guilty of gay 
lovemaking are given a choice of 
four death styles: being hanged, 
stoned, halved by a sword, or 
dropped from the highest perch. 
According to Article 152 of Iran’s 
penal law, if two men not related 
by blood are found naked under 
one cover without good reason, 
both will be punished at a judge’s 
discretion.”
Remember, this is a nation 
seeking the technology to develop 
nuclear weapons. Remember also 
that Hitler, for all his homicidal 
abilities, never had the pleasure 
of acquainting himself with that 
particular brand of destructive
power.
Hitler, in a 1936 speech, said, 
“I believe today that I am act­
ing in the sense of the Almighty 
Creator. By warding off the Jews 
I am fighting for the Lord’s work.” 
Over 6 million Jews were killed 
in the Holocaust, almost annihi­
lating European Jewry.
Mahmoud has claimed that 
the Holocaust never happened. 
In official statements, later to 
be referred to as Iranian state 
policy, President Ahmadinejad 
called the Holocaust a “myth.” 
He remarked, “They [the Jews] 
have invented a myth that Jews 
were massacred and place this 
above God, religions, and the 
prophets.” Once again, these

words are not attributed to an 
ordinary Holocaust denier, but to 
the president of a country with 
nuclear ambitions.
Adolf Hitler and associates 
made remarks in 1941 stating 
their desire to remove “the 
Jewish cancer from the breast 
of Germany.” In a 2005 speech 
titled “The World Without 
Zionism,” President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad referenced Israel, 
saying, “As the imam said, Israel 
must be wiped off the map.”
The only thing missing for 
purposes of clarity is the groom­
ing of President Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad’s beard into a 
Hilter-esque moustache. There 
is an absolute development of a
state policy of annihilation and 
imprisonment on the basis of 
creed, religion, and sexual pref­
erence.
The question before the world 
today is whether or not we have 
improved our civilization to the 
point of having the ability to 
recognize distinct, yet similarly 
styled, patterns of evil. Said pat­
terns, if recognized through due 
diligence, can be pre-emptively 
thwarted before they are allowed 
to come to fruition.
With the future hanging in the 
balance of the splitting atom,

Celebrate rock and roll
Musical revolutionaries remain timeless
You've got to be good — really good — to make 
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But how does 
one define "really good"? Just start a musical 
revolution.
Rock and roll has at least 10 artists to thank for 
its birth: Chuck Berry, James Brown, Ray Charles, 
Sam Cooke, Fats Domino, the Everly Brothers, 
Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and 
Elvis Presley.These musicians set the bar on 
January 23,1986, as the first Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame inductees — yeah, these guys were really 
good.
How much better could they get? With the funky 
boogie-woogie of Fats Domino, the country guitar 
of the Everly Brothers, and the vocal brilliance of 
Buddy Holly, you can find so much musical flavor 
packed into a single group of musicians.
As a whole, the music of these original 10 
artists epitomizes rock and roll's eclectic fabric, 
showcasing the funk and soul of James Brown, 
the blues and jazz of Ray Charles, and the energy 
and voice of Little Richard all within one genre. 
Their common link is manifested in the Hall of 
Fame's stated mission: "The Rock and Roll Hall 
of Fame honors the legendary performers... who 
have made rock and roll the force in our culture 
that it is."
But these artists have done more than affect 
culture. These artists have shown that music is 
a culture in and of itself — an art that picks from 
multiple genres and blends them into one. Having 
begun his music career as a church gospel singer, 
Little Richard's music is marked by shouting atop 
rhythm and blues — loud rhythm and blues — 
and edgy lyrics. Similarly, James Brown allowed 
for much experiment through his integration of
jazz into rhythm and blues, exploration of rapid 
vocal styles, and his combination of saxophone, 
trombone, drums, and guitar.
It's hard not to recognize their hits. Memorable 
licks and lyrics, deep rhythms and rhymes, lively 
souls and sounds bolstered the tunes of their 
unprecedented musical careers. Chuck Berry, 
among the most influential rock stars of all time, 
motivated the work of such artists as 1988 Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame inductees the Beatles and 
the Beach Boys with songs like "Back in the USA" 
and "Sweet Little Sixteen." In fact, the Beach 
Boys liked Berry's "Sweet Sixteen" so much that 
they turned it into their own hit with new lyrics: 
"Surfin'USA." Music management must have 
been a little different 40 years ago.
Of course, that's not to overlook the impact 
of past musicians on Berry — his blues songs 
"Merry Christmas Baby"originally by Charles 
Brown and "Things I Used To Do" originally 
by Eddie "Guitar Slim" Jones convey obvious 
influences of earlier artists, and Berry's own 
combination of blues and country reflects the 
influence of genres outside of rock.
Of course, you don't have to take my word for 
it. The unparalleled success of these artists is 
reflected in records sold — perhaps over one 
billion in Elvis'case — and the number of top-40 
hits — over 20 for many of the artists. But what's 
the truest measure of the success of such stars as 
Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Sam Cooke? We're still 
singing their songs today. "Goodness, gracious, 
great balls of fire!"

The Tartan did not print during the week of January 
23-27,1956.
Residents of Morewood Gardens faced a host of 
problems with their building, according to an article 
in The Tartan. Among the problems was a water 
main break, as well as malfunctioning toilets. The 
Tartan reported that “no cause has yet to be found 
for the break," but it was discovered the pipes 
had been clogged with dirt. One thing they didn’t 
report on was the look (or smell) of the student 
body after days without water.
The Tartan angrily complained about the slow 
speed with which fall semester grades reached 
students. The paper noted that often students did 
not receive a copy of their grades by mail until the 
last week of winter break. CMU students demand 
respect. We demand to know immediately how 
badly we failed.
The campus bookstore looked to improve services. 
Some of the ideas included changing the labeling 
on shelves so that used books were easier to find 
and so that students could tell immediately if used 
books were not available. They did not suggest 
that they should change the price of a notebook 
from the ridiculous $4.50 to the only slightly less 
baffling $3.50.
A 34-year-old man was reported to be trespassing 
in West Wing. He was sighted by students who 
reported him to Campus Police. The man claimed 
one of the residents of West Wing was his friend. 
That is, if you count people you bumped into on 
the bus as friends.

---------------------------------------------------

While most CMU students were enjoying their winter 
vacations, a select few braved snow and bacteria alike in the 
pursuit of one thing: music. When WQED, a classical radio 
station in the Pittsburgh area, decided to dispose of their 
entire vinyl collection, Carnegie Mellon’s own WRCT was 
there to claim some of about 5000 trashed records.
“We dumpster-dove," said Mike Szczerban, a senior English 
major and the staff representative of WRCT.
This is only the beginning of what makes WRCT unique as 
a college radio station, an activity for students, and a part of 
the city of Pittsburgh. Created in 1948, WRCT began with a 
signal so weak that it could only be heard within a few feet 
of the electrical wiring of CIT. Now, 58 years later, it has a 
signal a thousand times stronger than that of the University of 
Pittsburgh, boasting a radius of 12.5 miles. With that in mind, 
it might not be a surprise that many residents of Pittsburgh 
with no affiliation to Carnegie Mellon tune in to WRCT. What 
is surprising is just how few of the station’s listeners actually 
attend CMU. Hardly anyone at Carnegie Mellon owns a radio, 
let alone uses it. Although most people have a computer, they 
don't know that WRCT can also be heard online.
Part of the reason for the lack of student interest is-what 
Matthew Siko, a senior materials science engineering major 
and the general manager of WRCT, calls "the iPod effect."
The advent of the iPod and similar devices has allowed many 
coOege-goers to be content with their own music collections, 
and thus less interested in sampling new artists. Matt 
Merewitz, a fifth year senior history major and the station's 
music director, explained that the population of CMU appears 
to be largely influenced by MTV and other mainstream 
sources, which offer music that's rarely found on WRCT.
College radio is known for giving exposure to new or unknown 
artists, and WRCT is no exception. For example,'"Sufjan
Stevens’ new album, which is becoming increasingly popular 
in indie music circles, was introduced by college radio. WRCT 
strives to air material that, as Merewitz said, "can’t be heard 
anywhere else on the Pittsburgh dial,” and in the pursuit 
of this goal, it has made an invaluable contribution to the 
musical palette of the city.
The employees of WRCT can draw on their different 
backgrounds to add variety to the music they choose to play. 
The DJs range from CMU students to Pitt professors to local 
DJs, all of whom share an intense passion for the music.
And does gender play a role in the music that’s chosen?
Well, maybe not so much. As Szczerban says, the station is 
basically "all dudes, all the time."
The DJs.are given complete freedom during their shows. As 
Szczerban described, “It's like making a mix tape." The DJs 
usually start with something and just go with the flow — they 
play whatever they think would go next, continuously until 
their time DJ-ing is over. “It’s like the difference between 
a professional chef and someone who cooks at home,” 
Szczerban said. The person who cooks at home can make a 
decent meal out of whatever is in his kitchen, in the same 
way that an iPod owner can make a playlist out of the songs 
in his library. On the other hand, the professional chef is 
able to create a culinary masterpiece in less time with more 
ingredients. Similarly, the DJs of WRCT are able to make a 
unique playlist, even integrating a new song here and there, 
often with little preparation.
The extensive library at the station, which holds more records 
and CDs than most people have ever seen in their lives, 
ensures that the DJs can always find a unique song to play on 
their show. The genres of the shows range from your typical 
indie-pop college radio to classical and jazz shows to talk 
shows. This diversity gives the listeners the opportunity to 
become connoisseurs of nearly every type of music-
Despite the meager following that WRCT has on campus, it 
has a cadre of devoted listeners of all ages in the Pittsburgh 
area. Some have been listening for years, even decades. What 
initially draws them to the station is the same thing that 
deters most CMU students: the body of music that it plays. 
WRCT isn’t trying to play popular songs that everyone wants 
to hear; it is trying to play new songs that people should learn 
about. One of the main goals of the station is to educate its 
listeners about all types of music, constantly giving them 
something to add to their bank of musical knowledge.
The station provides opportunities for everyone on campus 
to get involved, from the engineers in the technical aspects, 
to the music majors who put on their own classical shows. 
Carnegie Mellon does not offer a degree in broadcasting, so 
working at the station is the best place to develop these skills 
and share a love of music. Not to mention, it's the perfect 
opportunity to turn off your iPod for a while and hear some 
new tunes. As Merewitz said, “it’s a labor of love," and the 
only form of payment is hearing the music. As long as you’re' 
into it, you’re sure to enjoy it.

Beer pong: Not just your Friday night frat game
CMU alumni create World Series of Beer Pong tournament
BeerPngBllr: i cant believe we lost last night! sorry I let you 
down bro. i practiced my throw for hours and I even did 4 
pushups to get better upper body stregnth.
6Cupsodelight: np. hey wait, what are you talking about?
BeerPngBllr: at the big game last night:(
You might think this conversation is between two athletes 
who failed to stay hydrated, but it's not. Nor is this 
conversation between two athletes who just lost a division 
championship. It’s a conversation between two athletes in the 
prime of their careers over a game soaked with history, glory, 
and anguish. This game is called beer pong.
There are few sports, if any, that encourage drug use. Sure, 
athletes sometimes get away with steroid use. But being 
high? You must be out of your mind. Drunk? Never. The 
highly competitive sport of beer pong is the exception to 
that rule; the point of the game is to drink enough that your 
coordination goes from being decent (hitting the cup and, 
occasionally, opposing team members) to pitiful (throwing the 
ball behind your head or over a balcony) to fantastic (hitting 
every throw while not being able to remember your own 
name).
Beer pong is a simple game — mostly because drunk people 
can't play complicated games. It’s played by two teams, 
typically on a broken table that happens to be missing a leg or 
the door to your apartment resting on a pile of cinderblocks.
Each team has six or 10 cups with about a quarter can of beer 
in each — depending on how hardcore you’d like to play — 
and a few cups of water to clean off the balls between throws. 
Each team's players take a shot at their opponents' cups with 
a ping-pong ball. When a team member manages to hit a cup, 
the other team has to drink the beer from that cup post haste. 
Yeah, we know, losing has never tasted — or felt — so good.
Taking it to another level
Carnegie Mellon might be a Division El school, but we've 
got some amazing pong-ball-tossing alumni. Two of our 
most highly regarded athletes — Billy Gaines and Duncan 
Carroll — organized the first ever World Series of Beer Pong, 
which ran from January 2 through January 6 of this year.
How would an event like this ever get started? To quote 
Carroll from his site, www.bpong.com, "I remember thinking 
this game was pretty hard. There should be a national 
tournament.” Sometimes dreams really do come true.
So you’re starting to get serious about beer pong. You’ve 
cracked your knuckles, rubbed your beer belly, and stopped 
going to your 9:30 am class. Now all you need is some high- 
quality gear. Look no further than our two beloved alums’ 
website. The site details the rules of beer pong, features 
some of the best tables created across the country, and allows 
people to register for the next World Series of Beer Pong. What 
more could you ask for (besides a GPA that's higher than your 
BAC)?
Maybe a place in the WSOBP tournament. The goal of every 
tournament is to win — and in this case, to win big. But here,
you don’t have to be recruited out of college to play... though 
it might help. All you need here is endurance in the form of 
high tolerance, so what better place to start training than 
college?
Be aware, while your relationship with your buddies might 
improve, your romantic life will probably suffer — you know, 
due to your rigorous training schedule and increasingly 
degrading physique. Carroll discussed his breakup with 
his own girlfriend in Playboy magazine. As he explained,
"It wasn’t really specifically the event itself. It was sort of 
bpong.com in general. It was questionable to where my 
priorities were. The long-distance situation also played a 
part. But she was definitely like, 'You care about beer pong 
more than me.’” This is not so far-fetched, since many CMU 
students are more committed to their work than their social 
lives already. Long-distance relationships, beware: beer pong 
cometh.
At the World Series of Beer Pong, the prize is $10,000 and the 
pressure is so high it can get to even the best. “These are 
everyday people who have an opportunity to do something," 
Gaines said in the Playboy interview. "They know, ‘If I miss 
this shot, I’m out. If I hit this shot, I win $10,000.’ ’’

Exit Coldplay, enter Paris Hilton
Some new and returning artists to look for — and ignore — in 2006
The year 2005 was quite a good one for music. Coidplay 
released the lush X&Y, with biggest-band-in-the-world 
written all over it. Kanye West dropped Late Registration, 
an over-the-top, self-indulgent, yet somehow musically 
sophisticated record. Late Registration encapsulated the 
highs and lows of the savior of what I like to call “hip-pop" 
music. Smaller groups like Arcade Fire and Clap Your Hands 
Say Yeah, as well as not-so-small-anymore rockers The 
Killers, saw their musical careers go from café gigs to sold-out 
stadium concerts.
The big question still remains, though... can 2006 top 2005? 
We've already seen disappointing releases, including a 
weak record from The Strokes. Will the next 11 months bring 
redemption? We can't be certain, but here are 10 upcoming 
releases that just might be your ears' new best friends (and 
one that might be their worst).
1. Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stadium Arcadium — Due out 
on May 9, one of rock’s biggest bands will emerge with 
their follow-up to 2002's By The Way with a double album 
of 25 funky tracks. With rock and roll legend Rick Rubin on 
production, it’s hard to see how this is going to be a bad 
album.
2. The Shins, Sleeping Lessons or Wincing The Night Away — 
Expected sometime in May, The Shins’ new release has more 
of the catchy and uplifting thejnes that we've seen from them 
in the past. Anyone smell an encore performance at CMU 
Carnival?
3. Outkast, Idlewild — It seems like it's been forever since 
Outkast put out the boundary-breaking Speakerboxx/
Love Below (hard to believe it's been less than two years). 
Idlewild — the soundtrack to the movie of the same name — 
has been pushed back so many times, you’d think it was a 
Guns 'N Roses album. Alas, the current tentative release date 
is Valentine's Day.
4. Kanye West, Graduation — The third CD in a four-part 
series, Graduation is expected to drop in late 2006. With a 
long winter tour of college campuses (including a stop at the 
University of Pittsburgh) and concert halls behind him, Kanye 
will (hopefully) return to the studio shortly to work on his 
upcoming release. The sooner the better, Kanye, the sooner 
the better.
5. The Fugees, yet untitled — It's been a decade since the 
biggest name in hip-hop put out a record, but the time has 
finally come. The Fugees have been in the studio and are 
slated to release their newest CD later this year.
6. Arctic Monkeys, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What 
I'm Not — You may not have heard of them yet, but you sure 
will on February 21 when their album drops in the U.S. Brit 
teen-rockers Arctic Monkeys signed with U.K. indie rock label 
Domino Records (home to rock giants Franz Ferdinand) last 
spring, and have been getting serious recognition ever since.
7. Pearl Jam, yet untitled — After relentless touring, Seattle’s 
grunge-rockers will drop their first disc with J Records, and 
their eighth overall, in the spring.
8. John Mayer, Continuum — Love him or hate him, John 
Mayer has gained recognition from the world of braless 
babes and legendary musicians. From gigs with jazz legend 
Herbie Hancock to sold-out concerts of his own, Mayer has 
undertaken the role of a talented blues guitar player who can 
appeal to the masses. Look for his new disc this spring.
9. Tool, yet untitled — It’s been about four years since Tool re- 
emerged with Lateralus. Although very few details have been 
released about the new record, the long-awaited follow-up is 
supposedly due in April or May.
10/ Christian Scott, Rewind That — Nephew of legendary 
jazz saxophonist Donald Harrison, 22-year-old trumpet 
phenom Scott will release his debut CD from Concord Jazz 
on March 28. Although many young jazz musicians are 
technically proficient, few are creatively exciting. Look for 
Scott’s record this spring to join the likes of Robert Glasper 
and other young jazz musicians who are both technically and 
creatively inspiring.
What not to look for in 2006:
Paris Hilton, yet untitled — Teaming.up with producer 
extraordinaire and ex-Roots keyboardist Scott Storch (who 
produced hits like Beyonce’s "Naughty Girl,” 50 Cent’s 
"Candy Shop,” and many others), Paris Hilton is expected to 
release her first (and hopefully last) record in April.
Although 2006 got off to a rocky start, it’s showing a lot of 
promise with these and many other upcoming releases. Look 
for numerous edgy acts that will push the envelope of pre­
existing genres, as well as more generic groups who may lack 
originality, but make up for it with instrumental prowess and 
group chemistry. It looks like 2006 might just be the year that 
the suffering music industry has been waiting for.

Brokeback Mountain sells tickets... and civil unions?
Ang Lee’s latest film challenges conservative-minded audiences
Curious George never meant so much. The owners of the 
Manor Theater in Squirrel Hill probably didn't have symbolic 
undertones in mind when they tacked up the blinding yellow 
poster for the spring 2006 film. On it, everyone’s favorite 
domesticated primate mimics the scrutinizing American 
people, fixing his binocular gaze on the denim-and-wide-brim- 
clad cowboys from Brokeback Mountain positioned across 
from him.
This poster is modeled after the last unfortunate love story 
to draw such fervor at the box office, Titanic, but Brokeback 
Mountain's edgier scenes are likely to draw more gasps from 
your grandma than Leo DiCaprio tracing Kate Winslet’s nipple 
on a couch. The social resonance of Brokeback Mountain 
extends beyond James Cameron's calling for a moment of 
silence as he accepted his second Oscar.
Shot for a fraction of a Namia-scale budget and headlined by 
an actor best known for his breakthrough work in 10 Things 
I Hate About You, Brokeback Mountain might not have been 
forecasted to be this decade's most socially charged film (like, 
say, Get Rich or Die Tryin).
However, Ang Lee’s quiet story of two ranch hands who fall 
in love one summer at Brokeback Mountain has produced 
more than tear-dampened blouse sleeves and witless jokes 
involving the word “lasso."
“Everybody loves it,” declared Manor Theater employee Jay 
Pearlstein. Pearlstein, a concession attendant at one of two
Pittsburgh theaters to initially open the film, was shocked by 
the universal acclaim until he sat in on the film himself.
"It’s really about love," Pearlstein said, reflecting the 
explanation producers have given to the film's success.
Unfortunately, though, not everyone is pickin’ up this good 
vibration. Theater owners in Utah and West Virginia have 
refused to show the tale of star-crossed lovers (“Romeo and 
Julio,” according to some comic geniuses). Big surprise, 
you’re thinking, the lands of Salted Lakes and Mountaineers 
don’t want to see gay cowboys. I could have told you that 
after watching Dateline for a couple of minutes.
But reactions to the film have blended the red-state-blue-state 
coding into, well, purple.
Utah theater owner Larry Miller’s decision not to show the film 
has prompted the GLBT Community Center of Utah to issue 
a community call to action. Some citizens, explained Center 
Executive Director Valerie Larabee, wanted to "picket and 
be harsher.” Larabee stated that the organization is leading a 
campaign to “educate and give people options besides Larry 
Miller's franchise.”
Brokeback's success in smaller, less liberal cities such as 
Cincinnati and Milwaukee has tom the sails of those insisting 
the film is pure propaganda — an attempt to persuade the 
country-road rednecks to flirt, if you will, with the idea of 
gay marriage. A similar attack was launched on TV show 
Commander in Chief, with bloggers and pundits “exposing”
its agenda to get Hillary into the White House.
Conservative writer David Kupelian calls the film the "rape 
of the Marlboro Man.” According to Kupelian, Heath Ledger 
and Jake Gyllenhaal have transformed the iconic American 
hero — the cowboy — into another marketing tool. Only this 
time, they’re not selling exhalable shortcuts to death, they’re 
selling... CIVIL UNIONS!
“No, Mr. Ranger, no!”
Regardless of the political climate brewing over a couple of 
sheep herders, Pittsburghers are “flocking” to grab tickets. 
Weekday showings are selling to crowds of 50 or more at 
Manor, and I mean, who goes to see movies on Wednesday 
afternoons?
The Manor Theater’s owners manage the Cinemagic on 
Forward Avenue, too, where King Kong was also showing on 
two screens.
"King Kong bombed,” Pearlstein explained, "but all kinds of 
people are coming to see Brokeback Mountain."
Hi-ho, silver.

Alien
Wednesday, January 25 
1012
You should never investigate 
mysterious distress signals. A 
phallic alien will always begin eating 
through your chest and wreak 
havoc upon your crew. It is a sci- 
fi cliché, but while many modern 
films would hurry to these slasher 
scenes, Ridley Scott masterfully 
constructs Alien in the spirit of 
Spielberg’s Jaws. The film dwells 
on the suspense of uncertainty and 
not on the fleeting joy of gore. The 
terrifying monster dwelling in this 
movie’s creepy atmosphere never 
gets old, and you will definitely get 
some thrills.
Playtime
Thursday, January 26 
81012
Director Jacques Tati bankrupted 
himself on this film, which, in the 
late ’60s, was the most expensive 
French film ever made. The movie 
really features no plot and no hero, 
but rather dwells on very big shots 
with action everywhere. There is 
a M. Hulot who gets somewhere 
and causes some trouble, but Tati 
marginalizes this. Your eyes will 
dart from one part of the screen 
to another in an attempt to catch 
everything. Many critics agree that 
only multiple viewings of Playtime 
from multiple different theater seats 
will give a full appreciation, because 
its beautiful embracing of detail and 
its huge scenes will blow you away.
Ferris Bueller’s Day Off
Friday, January 27 
1012
A light and innocent comedy about 
a high school student, played by 
Matthew Broderick, who fakes 
illness to spend the day with his 
girlfriend and his best friend. The 
movie follows the three teens 
around Chicago as they learn more 
about the city and each other.
Ferris sometimes gets on too high 
a soapbox, but his intentions, 
along with those of the movie, are 
well-placed. The movie uses some 
clever devices, and if the comedy 
does not strike your fancy, the very 
nice views of the Windy City and 
the conversation between the teens 
will.
Chicken Little
Saturday, January 28 
81012
Disney still cannot relive their glory 
days of yore, when characters 
mattered and plot had good 
premises. It feels like the only 
new thing here is Disney’s stab at 
computer animation. The film goes 
straight for the kids among us, and 
I can only imagine theaters filled 
with families, not college students. 
Don’t look for a redeeming story.
It will get a few smiles and giggles 
only for its cuteness, but don’t stay 
for a lasting film.
Three... Extremes
Sunday, January 29 
10 12
This one film really is made of 
three. As the title suggests, they 
are pretty extreme. Some of Asia’s 
most talented new directors — Fruit 
Chan, Takashi Miike, and Chan- 
wook Park — have contributed 
three horror films that each run 
between 30 and 60 minutes. They 
all have an ineffable, shocking 
creepiness. The three directors 
wanted to throw away many of 
the horror genre’s old devices, and 
their short films, wrought with a 
nightmarish quality, will definitely 
give you some extreme chills. Go to 
be profoundly disturbed.

Encyclopedia Destructica, the zine years
A mixture of art and writing in its beginning stages makes this zine just a little different
F by Michelle BovaContributing Editor]
Students at Carnegie Mellon are sometimes happy just to 
sit down with a cup of coffee, but now they might pick up 
some interesting “reading" material along with their caffeine 
boost. In addition to the few minutes’ rest, students may find 
themselves invited to enjoy the early works of local artists.
The experience comes courtesy of Encyclopedia Destructica,
¦ a creative zine that came about thanks to two CMU alumni, 
the self-titled “directors" of the project.
Any zine by its very nature calls out to college student 
sensibilities. It is produced at a low cost, which is essential 
for students who wish to produce the publications. More 
importantly, a zine tends to be cheap to buy — or free. 
Encyclopedia Destructica brings together the work of artists 
in the introductory stages of their work. Its first volume is 
made up of four regular issues plus a single addendum, 
collectively known as Volume Atum. In a single issue you 
can read a short story, admire a sketch of a hill covered in 
houses, or laugh at pictures of cartoon sheep — and best of 
all it, carries little or no cost. Not only can you enjoy it with 
your cup of coffee, you can enjoy the issues of Encyclopedia 
Destructica free at coffee shops around town or purchase 
them at local bookstores.
Some of the places you might find copies are Kiva Han or 
Quiet Storm, or for a pittance you can pick up issues at shops 
such as Caliban Bookstore. Encyclopedia Destructica also 
travels to fairs and shows around Pittsburgh. Last October 
they were featured at the “Media Swap Meet" at the Mattress
Factory. You can find other 
local zines, like The 
Unicorn Mountain or 
Salt, in the same 
environments.
Encyclopedia 
Destructica 
started as a 
concept in the 
mind of alumnus 
Chris Kardambikis, who 
graduated with a degree 
in Fine Arts last year. The 
strange title comes from an 
episode of The Simpsons. In 
the episode, a documentary 
is being filmed about the 
Simpson family, and the narrator
describes some Simpson “debauchery" as “just Volume One 
of the Encyclopedia Self-Destructica." Tom Weinrich, who 
was heavily involved in the first issue of the zine, suggested 
that they adapt this line for the title of the publication.
Each issue differs greatly from the next. Kardambikis said 
that before each printing, the directors discuss how to lay out 
the issue around the work. This way, the zine is not stagnant, 
but rather looks different from issue to issue. “The way we 
do it is ... building up each issue around themes that we find 
in certain ... people’s work,” said Jasdeep Khaira, another 
director of Encyclopedia Destructica. These themes are not 
necessarily the content of the art, but sometimes the style. 
The first issue is about “people creating worlds."
Khaira and Kardambikis emphasize that the thematic ideas 
are very free-flowing and loose. However, the second volume 
is going to concentrate entirely on concerns of artists in 
the Pittsburgh area. Kardambikis said that they hope future 
volumes will be able to concentrate on another city, or could 
be a dialogue between artists in Pittsburgh and artists in a 
different city. Ultimately, the presentation of each issue is 
dedicated to allowing the pieces of art contained within to 
interact.
In the inaugural issue the format is relatively basic. For 
example, the issue contains a lot of line drawings and works 
in ink. The directors said that most issues contain three 
to five artists, but there are exceptions. Destructica also 
contains a bit of writing, but never over a few pages long. 
Creative writing might no.t be anticipated beside visual art, 
Khaira said. "People might not consider collecting poetry and 
publishing it [to be] art,” she said. “We might have writing

sketches of cartoon sheep (left 
and top) into the first issue of 
Encyclopedia Destructica.
[in the issues], but it’s writing as an art form.” True to this 
sentiment, Destructica considers the term "artist" to refer to 
those who write as well as those who work in visual media.
In the future, they aim to open up the doors to more 
forms. Khaira, who graduated in 20.04 from the Bachelor of 
Humanities and Arts program, said that a lot of interest has 
been expressed for doing work with sound or music. “We’re 
hoping to incorporate that [sound] into our next volume,” she 
said. “People [could] work with some kind of visual thing and 
the sound would interact with how you flip the pages.”
At present, the first volume uses paper as it primary medium. 
But that does not limit Encyclopedia Destructica, which 
is open to any form the zine might take. If sound is added, 
Kardambikis said they may include CDs with the zine or 
provide the sound portion on the website. The intent is to 
create a dialogue between the artists, to "find whose art will 
communicate best together," Kardambikis said.
Part of the work, Kardambikis said, is “just trying to decide 
the best way to package everyone’s artwork.”

The zine takes the shape of the art inside it. If you find the 
fourth issue of Volume Atum, it opens to reveal sketches 
done on transparent paper. There is a sort of "frame” through 
which you can pass two layers of sketches until they overlap 
one another to reveal a new picture entirely. The fourth issue 
is by far the one that invites you to pick it up the most. It 
works like magic, and overlaying the sketches in new ways is 
slightly addictive.
Though the first issue is basic, later issues are much more 
interactive. The format of Encyclopedia Destructica engages 
the audience. At first, it was merely by flipping pages, but 
in later issues. Destructica invites you to overlay sketches 
or make a “do-it-yourself” minizine called "Let's Move to 
Canada!” The minizine vaguely reflects Destructica itself, 
as Kardambikis feels that “Pittsburgh has a pretty extensive 
do-it-yourself culture.” Khaira added that Encyclopedia 
Destructica tries to bring "that culture to a wider audience."
issue of Destructica. Though Kardambikis and Khaira are 
the directors of the project, they will allow members of the 
community to edit an issue. This is just another part of 
making Destructica as collaborative as possible.
Like those that come along to help at binding parties, 
Kardambikis notes that most responses to Destructica are 
positive. “The excitement that we see from people ... really 
fuels us to keep doing it, too. It’s just great sometimes when 
people start spouting off ideas."
One of the interesting facets of Encyclopedia Destructica is 
that it is all "sketch work” in some form or another. All pieces 
are works in progress. But why? “So much of what I like about 
art is discussing artwork with other artists," Kardambikis 
explained, "and seeing what people are actually working 
on.” Being able to look at works in progress, whether they be 
visual or literary, allows artists to look at the others’ processes.
Each issue of Destructica is an “in-house” project; each issue 
has been printed by the directors themselves. Because of this, 
Khaira said that all the production for the first volume came 
out of pocket. It costs about $200 to $300 to produce an issue 
of Destructica. The zine is about to get a little outside help, 
however. They have been awarded a grant from the Sprout 
Fund, which will be used to produce the second volume, 
Volume Bumba. The Sprout Fund was started in part by a 
Heinz School alum and it awards small grants to innovative 
projects on a yearly basis.
At a smaller level, students or community members can get 
involved in Destructica by attending "binding parties." These 
get-togethers attract volunteers who are interested in the 
project and who come to help put together the hand-bound 
copies. "We set up stations for everyone and ... we get people 
to help with the sewing and such,” said Kardambikis. "We've 
had a lot of people who [say], 'I don’t have sketch work but 
I really want to help and I really like your idea.”’ In return for 
the help with binding production, the Destructica directors 
provide food and beverages. Khaira said that once people get 
set up with some food and mimosas, they're ready to start 
helping out with production.
Those who really want to get involved can elect to edit an
“The reason we’ve chosen to have sketchbook work is [that] 
we think that [form] is sort of looser,” said Khaira. "[It is] 
something you can ... pick up and look through and it’s 
not some kind of shiny art on the wall.”
Most Carnegie Mellon students are not going to be 
familiar with the artists contained within Encyclopedia 
Destructica, as most won’t have a background in 
art. Khaira believes that the issues still appeal to 
those outside the arts, though, because “they are so 
accessible and the location that we’re putting them 
at encourages people from outside the arts [to look]....
It’s not like going to an art gallery.... Here they can 
take whatever they want from it.”
Keep your eyes peeled for the latest Encyclopedia 
Destructica if you’d like a little light “reading" 
with your coffee.

Student leader helps bridge gaps on campus
Omar Parris-Dione praises administration’s efforts to unite diverse student groups
Marcus Gho | Photo Staff
During Martin Luther King Day's keynote 
presentation last Monday, senior Omar 
Parris-Dione was chosen as a prominent 
student leader on campus to speak in the 
same lineup as President Jared Cohon 
and Dr. Derrick Bell.
Name: Omar Parris-Dione 
Year: Senior 
Major: Economics 
Hometown: Harlem, New York
Clubs and Organizations: Alpha Phi Alpha, Inc.; African 
Student Association; Undergraduate Finance Club; Savoy 
Marketing Group; CAST; NFL Play It Smart Program; 
various youth mentoring programs
Student leaders play a prevalent role in promoting 
leadership, service, and diversity within a community. 
Oftentimes we forget about the active roles these students 
assume while juggling their busy academic and social 
routines. But when events like Martin Luther King Day, 
Black History Month, Asian-American Heritage Month, 
and other occasions arise, we sit up and take notice. Senior 
Omar Parris-Dione, who was most recently featured as the 
Undergraduate Student Speaker for the Martin Luther King 
Day keynote address, is one such leader.
As a youth growing up with mentors including pastors, 
relatives, professors and advisors, Parris-Dione strongly 
believes that “mentorship goes a long way." Individuals 
such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Frederick Douglass 
served as personal role models — each were dedicated 
to community service, and strived to promote change. By 
looking toward these historical examples, Parris-Dione 
has actively sought out opportunities to contribute to the 
community in the direction he wants to see the world 
change. Through heavy involvement in various youth 
mentoring programs with neighboring high schools, Parris- 
Dione gives back to the community in much the same way 
his mentors have helped him.
Parris-Dione views himself as a direct recipient of the 
opportunities provided by affirmative action. While some 
people may perceive the program as unfair, others view 
it as a bridge to achieving goals. Parris-Dione recalls that 
he got into a lot of trouble in high school while he was a 
student at Frederick Douglass Academy. However, he met 
a recruiter who learned about his active involvement and 
dedication to community service. She gave him a chance 
with an opportunity to attend Carnegie Mellon.
Parris-Dione believes that the University has given him 
a wide range of encouragement, support, and resources 
to explore and make the most of the diverse learning 
environment. According to Parris-Dione, “the University’s 
administration has perpetuated a strong sense of diversity 
through their open-mindedness, friendliness, and 
willingness to help. No other school has such a wide range 
of University events. [Furthermore,] the University cares 
about increasing enrollment for minorities."
Parris-Dione is a strong believer that “being American, 
everyone has equal opportunities, but not everyone
acknowledges it.” With this mentality, he’s been actively 
involved with the Pittsburgh community, mainly through 
his fraternity and the programs and seminars they organize.
From his beginnings in high school, Parris-Dione has 
launched himself into a schedule at CMU that hasn't 
slowed down even in his senior year. It starts the night 
before: writing down his plans for the new day, ironing 
his clothes, and getting books and notes ready for classes 
the next day. By the time his alarm rings, he’s ready for far 
more than just going to class.
In between classes, he checks his e-mail, makes phone 
calls, prepares presentations, and searches for possible 
guest speakers for his fraternity, Alpha Phi Alpha. 
Parris-Dione looks for speakers who can help bring a 
new perspective to the average college student about 
academics, internships, organizing personal finances, and 
family issues.
Like many other students, Parris-Dione studies and 
goes online to shop in order to help himself relax. In the 
evenings, he usually gets together with his fraternity 
brothers for dinner. Although many people get together 
with their friends for dinner in order to catch up on their 
day, Parris-Dione and his brothers not only reflect on what 
happens during their day, they sit together and plan out 
possible events for the future. They talk over dinner about 
elements of the community that need to be changed, and 
courses of actions or programs they can develop to help 
make these changes a reality.
Diversity at Carnegie Mellon University is a popular issue 
that gets a lot of attention each semester. While every 
culture has different customs, beliefs, and histories, Parris- 
Dione believes that "cultural differences shouldn’t seem 
like an obstacle in getting to know other people." Because 
every faith, religion, and good family has a high sense of 
morality and respect for the self and others, Parris-Dione 
sees more similarities than differences between humans 
across cultures. "The blame for the tendency of people 
to segregate themselves by race, religion, or cultural 
background is shared from all sides,” he said. People make 
assumptions about others who are different from them, 
and ultimately let these assumptions dictate their actions. 
According to Parris-Dione, the only way to bridge the gap 
between individuals with different backgrounds is to “wipe 
these preconceived notions from people's minds.”

The stars align today and the shallow caverns of your soul will flood with 
all the empty promises from the days of yore.
You think you are finally ready to comprehend, but more time will be 
needed to rectify the discrepancies between what is real and what is 
contrived.
Another day spent.
A déjà vu you will experience is not a déjà vu at all, but rather a real 
event charged to cyclically occur for aye.
Distortions in the crystal will make known that which is normally outside 
the periphery and will contain the answer to your disputed query.
Only you hold the key to the vexation and misadventures of your 
neighbor.
Your bliss will prove to be indomitable and withstand the Dionysian 
chaos that overwhelms others.
An unlikely exhibition will subconsciously inspire a bout of exhibitionism 
on scale previously unmatched by any unintentional endeavor.
Today, tranquility and repose will heal the turpitude of experience and 
the iniquity of the transgressions.
They will call today, and you know why. Answer carefully and 
deliberately.
Give credence to your wanton desires and vices.
The town of your birth is celebrating. Make haste; seek out your 
birthright.
