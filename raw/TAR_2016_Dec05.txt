This fall, Carnegie Mellon 
University’s football team 
captain, Samer Abdelmoty, a 
senior mechanical engineer-
ing major, along with the rest 
of the team, joined the Chil-
dren’s Hospital of Pittsburgh 
to create a 2017 calendar. All 
pro?ts from the calendar will 
go directly to the hospital. 
Carnegie Mellon’s foot-
ball team wanted to create 
a fundraiser that the team 
could start and continue as 
a tradition every year. “We 
have the Cindy Lackner Me-
morial game and fundraisers 
for breast cancer, but seeing 
that we do a lot with Team 
IMPACT, we ?gured it would 
be great to have an addition-
al fundraiser for kids in the 
community,” Abdelmoty said. 
“The Children’s Hospital of 
Pittsburgh seemed like the 
perfect option!”
 Team IMPACT is an 
organization that aims 
to improve the quality of 
life for children facing 
life-threatening and chronic 
illnesses by matching them 
with intercollegiate athletic 
teams. Currently three of 
Carnegie Mellon’s athletic 
teams, including the foot-
ball team, involve members 
from Team IMPACT in their 
program. 
Carnegie Mellon’s con-
nection with Team IMPACT 
began in 2014 when nine-
year-old Brock Kitterman 
joined the Tartan family as an 
honorary captain of the foot-
ball team. Kitterman attends 
many of the Tartan’s games 
and joins the other captains 
for the coin toss when he 
does. 
The team’s relationship 
with Kitterman motivated 
them to choose a fundraiser 
which would bene?t chil-
dren. “The decision on a cal-
endar kind of started as a joke 
with someone suggesting we 
do a type of speedo photo-
shoot and sell it to sorori-
ties,” Abdelmoty said. “Hav-
ing the idea of the Children’s 
Hospital in the back of our 
mind though we decided to 
get the best of both worlds 
and have a fun photoshoot 
while also helping the kids.”
Abdelmoty coordinated 
with the Children’s Hospi-
tal of Pittsburgh’s marketing 
team to choose patients and 
a venue for the photoshoot. 
Four patients and their fami-
lies came to Gesling Sta-
dium during pre-season in 
August to participate in the 
photoshoot. 
“Honestly the planning 
phase was probably the most 
fun,” Abdelmoty said. “Each 
position group was given a 
month in the calendar for 
whatever theme they wanted, 
so it was great hearing the 
crazy ideas some of the guys 
had and the props they would 
incorporate. Then to see how 
much the kids enjoyed being 
apart of these crazy themes 
was a great sight to see.” 
One of the patients from 
the photoshoot, seven year-
old Mikey Witkowski, joined 
Team IMPACT after the 
photoshoot and also became 
an honorary captain of the 
Carnegie Mellon Football 
team. The team was excited 
to gain a new member. “We 
got a Team IMPACT player 
from it which is awesome,” 
Abdelmoty said. “If we can 
help kids enjoy a photoshoot 
and families can get calen-
dars, I think that would be an 
awesome thing to leave as a 
legacy of this team.”
He added that “the biggest 
take-away from this project 
for me was realizing how 
great and tight-knit of a Carn-
egie Mellon community I’m a 
part of. No one at any point 
shot down the idea, the team 
was all willing to give up their 
time and effort for the shoot, 
and members of the Tartan 
community had no hesitation 
whatsoever in advertising the 
calendars or purchasing one 
for themselves to help out the 
cause.”

In late November, 
Carnegie Mellon Housing 
Services ?nalized the pro-
posed changes in Greek 
housing’s 2017–18 lease. 
Some major proposed 
changes include discontinu-
ing the collection of non-rent 
fees through the university 
sign over forms, restricting 
Greek organizations from 
subletting to boarders over 
the summer, and increasing 
the rent of Greek Quad hous-
ing by 5 percent in the next 
three years. Individual Greek 
organizations and Greek Life 
representatives are still de-
bating some details of this 
new contract; if consensus is 
reached, the new lease will 
become effective on July 1, 
2017.
In the initial proposal, 
Housing Services suggested 
that the university reserves 
the right to refund students 
who move out of Greek hous-
ing to other non-Greek af?li-
ated on campus housing for 
approved reasons. Carnegie 
Mellon Greek organizations, 
however, were not in favor of 
this change. This is because 
having a vacancy in a Greek 
house would mean that the 
rest of the residents of that 
house would have to pay ex-
tra to make up for the person 
or people that left.
Though the proposed 
policy would allow Greek or-
ganizations to “pull in” other 
students currently living 
in on campus housing, this 
change would place more 
pressure on the organiza-
tions and lead to more dis-
advantage. Stephanie Kane, 
president of Alpha Chi Ome-
ga and a senior in the School 
of Drama states that “[this 
policy] would teach students 
not to honor contracts.” This 
proposed policy is no longer 
part of the new lease pro-
posed by Housing Services 
because of the opposition it 
met. 
The students’ responses 
to other proposed changes 
are fairly neutral. Rebecca 
Ahmad, the Vice President 
of Communication and Fi-
nance of Carnegie Mellon 
Panhellenic and junior psy-
chology and statistics double 
major, said that students in 
Greek Life were not overly 
concerned with these new 
changes. “Overall, the big-
gest concern for people [in 
Greek organizations] is 
how to get people to ?ll the 
house. People are worried 
about how the prices have 
been increasing, and [Greek 
housing] might become less 
affordable,” Ahmad said. 
Greek housing has always 
been the most affordable 
option for on-campus hous-
ing, but the projected ?ve 
percent increase in rent over 
the three years and possible 
increase in other fees and 
expenses might counter this 
attractive aspect of Greek 
Life. Ahmad also said that 
this increase was likely a 
result of the million-dollar 
Greek housing debt, and 
Greek housing residents 
were frustrated because 
this debt falls solely on the 
Greek residents instead 
of the entire on-campus 
population. 
Tom Cooley, the director 
of Housing Services, antici-
pated that the new policy 
regarding the sign-over form 
would be met with frustra-
tion among Greek organiza-
tions. This is because all the 
fraternities and all but one 
sorority are currently using 
the sign-over form to charge 
fees and other expenses on 
top of rent. However, accord-
ing to students’ responses, 
using a third party system for 
transactions might be ben-
e?cial and more effective for 
Greek organizations. Alpha 
Chi Omega, the only sorority 
that does not currently use 
the sign-over form to charge 
expenses other than rent, 
has been using Billhighway 
to charge fees other than 
rent and meal plan for years. 
“[Billhighway] is a nation-
ally approved company that 
we’re allowed to charge our 
sisters on,” said Kane, “and 
[changing the sign-over form 
policy] would just mean we 
have to move a few charges 
from the student account 
to Billhighway.” In addition 
to these bene?ts, Housing 
Services also promised to 
help individual chapters ?nd 
third party companies and 
provide training for chapter 
leaders to get used to the 
new systems. 
The new policy that 
prevents boarders to sublet 
and live in the Greek houses 
could cause some ?nancial 
dif?culties for some Greek 
organizations, since a lot of 
Greek organizations view 
boarders as a means to raise 
revenue. However, Kane 
didn’t think that forbidding 
boarders in Greek housing 
would have a big impact on 
Alpha Chi Omega.
“We usually have a lot 
of sisters who would stay in 
the house over the summer 
because they take classes 
at Carnegie Mellon or they 
have internships in Pitts-
burgh,” remarked Kane, “it’s 
not really a problem for us 
since we usually don’t allow 
boarders to live in the house 
over the summer.” The main 
concern Housing Services 
had regarding boarders was 
that boarders are not covered 
under insurance, and are 
dif?cult to manage for indi-
vidual Greek organizations. 
In general, students’ 
responses to the new lease 
changes are optimistic as 
they believe that these 
changes will likely improve 
the way Greek organizations 
are run.

Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity is nationally recognized 
for contributing to ?elds in 
computer science and engi-
neering, but future President 
Donald Trump chose to focus 
on the Dietrich College of Hu-
manities and Social Sciences 
when appointing Professor 
Kiron Skinner to his transi-
tion team for the National Se-
curity Council which advises 
the President on national se-
curity and foreign policies. 
The distinguished 
professor began her career in 
the ?eld of political science 
by getting undergraduate 
degrees from both Spelman 
College and Sacramento City 
College. Skinner then went 
on to receive her masters and 
doctoral degrees in political 
science and international re-
lations from Harvard Univer-
sity. She has also been award-
ed an honorary doctor of laws 
degree from Molloy College 
in Long Island, New York. 
Skinner has been working 
at Carnegie Mellon since 
1999 and has since then 
founded the Institute for Poli-
tics and Strategy in Dietrich 
College. Both undergraduate 
and graduate students utilize 
this institute for research and 
the university uses it to es-
tablish initiatives in various 
areas from political science 
to national security. Skinner 
is also a fellow for Carnegie 
Mellon University’s CyLab 
and has received courtesy fac-
ulty appointments for the In-
stitute for Software Research 
and Heinz College. 
Additionally, Skinner 
manages the Center for Inter-
national Relations and Poli-
tics, the Washington Semes-
ter program, and the Institute 
for Strategic Analysis, which 
Dietrich College, College of 
Engineering, Heinz College, 
School of Computer Science, 
and the Software Engineer-
ing Institute all contribute 
to. She is also one of the in-
dividuals who developed 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
Master of Information Tech-
nology Strategy program. 
This masters program allows 
students to complete an 
interdisciplinary education 
involving cybersecurity is-
sues, international secu-
rity, and decision-making 
challenges. 
Outside of Carnegie 
Mellon University, Skinner 
has a lot of experience advis-
ing various types of people 
in Washington, D.C. For ex-
ample, Skinner is a special 
adviser to the Chief of Naval 
Operations, Admiral John 
Richardson. In addition, 
Skinner is part of the Council 
on Foreign Relations, a re-
search fellow for the Hoover 
Institution at Stanford, and 
a life director for the Atlan-
tic Council. Previously, Skin-
ner was part of the U.S. De-
fense Department’s Defense 
Policy Board and served as 
an adviser on the wars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Furthermore, Skinner is 
extremely involved in creating 
academic works for her ?eld. 
She co-wrote “The Strategy of 
Campaigning: Lessons from 
Ronald Reagan and Boris 
Yeltsin” with Serhiy Kudelia, 
Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, 
and Condoleezza Rice. This 
piece of writing is utilized at 
numerous research universi-
ties in their political science 
courses. Some other books 
Skinner helped to write were 
the two New York Times best 
sellers Reagan, A Life in Letters 
and Reagan, In His Own Hand. 
Skinner is also a regular con-
tributor of opinion editorials 
for National Review online, 
The New York Times, The Wall 
Street Journal, CNN, and The 
Washington Post.

PROGRESS helps women improve their communication and negotiation skillsResearchers at Carnegie Mellon and IIITD look into preventing sel?e-related deaths
With a growing number 
of deaths involving people 
taking selfies in hazardous 
locations, such as on rail-
road tracks or cliffs, com-
puter scientists at Carnegie 
Mellon University and the 
Indraprastha Institute of 
Information Technology in 
Delhi, India (IIITD), have 
conducted a new study to 
look into such accidents in 
hopes of finding a way to 
prevent them.
By looking through 
public records, research-
ers were able to collect and 
analyze a list of 127 deaths 
worldwide that were asso-
ciated with selfies between 
March 2014 and Sept. 2016. 
They then designed a com-
puter program that identi-
fies a selfie as dangerous 
based on location, image, 
and text, with 73 percent 
accuracy.
Ultimately, the goal 
of the study is to develop 
an app that would pre-
vent deaths, possibly by 
warning users of dangerous 
situations or temporarily 
disabling a phone’s camera. 
In addition, the data could 
be used in a public policy ap-
proach, by potentially estab-
lishing “no selfie zones” in 
certain areas and educating 
the public about dangerous 
selfie practices.
Ponnurangam Kumara-
guru, associate professor at 
IIITD with a Ph.D. in com-
puter science from Carnegie 
Mellon, explained that if an 
app were successfully imple-
mented, it could have far-
reaching benefits, beyond 
the scope of selfie-related 
accidents. For example, 
augmented reality games 
such as Pokemon Go can 
similarly put users at risk 
by diverting attention away 
from dangerous situations.
 “Every life is precious,” 
commented Kumaraguru, 
who launched the study af-
ter hearing reports of a self-
ie-related death. “When you 
see a problem in society, you 
find ways to use technology 
to solve it.”

DOMINIQUE ESCANDON
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabi-
net Writer of The Student 
Government. 
It’s dif?cult to express 
all that student government 
does on campus without 
mentioning what it has yet 
to do. It’s even harder for 
the different components of 
student government to real-
ize what communities within 
Carnegie Mellon need as-
sistance if those communi-
ties aren’t being represented 
within student government’s 
own system.
This past Wednesday, the 
members of the President’s 
Cabinet, the Student Body 
Vice President for Organiza-
tions, Graduate Student As-
sembly President, and the 
Vice President of the Student 
Dormitory Council met for 
the November/December 
Board of Directors meeting. 
Board of Directors meetings 
allow the different compo-
nents of student government 
to discuss relevant actionable 
issues regarding life on cam-
pus. Student Body President 
Vaasavi Unnava opened up 
the meeting with a ques-
tion: Who is underserved by 
student government on our 
campus?
Roughly ten groups were 
quickly brought up. Their 
members range from veter-
ans to art students, as well 
as students with families. 
The next conversation was 
harder. Are these groups un-
derrepresented in student 
government because of how 
student government is set up, 
or are we not doing an ad-
equate job of being inclusive? 
What speci?c needs do these 
groups have that student 
government could assist in?
There were so many things 
I had never realized about 
what unique challenges stu-
dents face on campus. Be-
ing a U.S. Citizen, I’ve never 
had to think about whether 
an employer would ?nd my 
candidacy worth managing 
the ever-complex U.S. Immi-
gration system, and hadn’t 
even realized how frustrating 
it must be for international 
students to ?nd employment 
options at on-campus career 
fairs which are limited for 
non-citizens. 
The percentage of 
international students in-
volved in undergraduate 
student government doesn’t 
match the 16 percent un-
dergraduate international 
student population. Our task 
now is to determine how we 
can make student govern-
ment more approachable for 
international students, to 
help ensure that their needs 
are met. (On a side note, the 
Graduate Student Assembly is 
doing a great job at matching 
their 60 percent international 
population!)
This was only the 
beginning of a long but much 
-needed discussion on how 
student government can and 
should change to provide bet-
ter service for the students 
it is representing. This is the 
reason why a main tenant of 
Vaasavi Unnava and Aaron 
Gutierrez’s campaign was 
focused on Student Govern-
ment Transparency; stu-
dent government reaches 
its highest potential only 
when students know what 
student government actu-
ally is and recognize their 
representation in it. 
We hope that we can begin 
to reach out to individual 
students and organizations 
more effectively, to promote 
communication so that our 
representation goals are met, 
and also hope that these dis-
cussions about providing for 
the unique needs of all our 
students are continued for 
years to come until student 
government is as diverse as 
the student body. As always, 
if you have any concerns or 
questions on how to achieve 
diversity, or why it’s impor-
tant, please feel free to reach 
out to anyone on the student 
government cabinet!
A new program at 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity seeks to help women 
and girls become better 
negotiators. It is called the 
Program for Research and 
Outreach on Gender Equity 
in Society (PROGRESS). 
Its goal it to help improve 
women’s negotiation skills 
to help them achieve goals 
which rely on having good 
communication skills. 
Ayana Ledford, 
executive director of the 
nonprofit, believes that 
there are numerous op-
portunities for students to 
negotiate in college. Some 
examples are negotiating 
with teachers on assign-
ments or negotiating clean-
ing responsibilities with a 
roommate. “As part of the 
program, women — and 
also men — will learn how 
to negotiate, share experi-
ences and learn to apply 
personal negotiation strat-
egies in a casual environ-
ment,” Ledford said in a 
university press release.
PROGRESS is based on 
the work of Linda Babcock, 
the James M. Walton 
Professor of Economics 
and head of the Social and 
Decision Sciences depart-
ment at Carnegie Mellon. 
Babcock co-authored the 
book “Women Don’t Ask: 
Negotiation and the Gen-
der Divide,” which includes 
her research on the art of 
negotiation and explores 
how this affects women. 
Babcock believes that bet-
ter negotiation skills can 
help women close the gen-
der wage gap and earn as 
much money as their male 
colleagues.
PROGRESS has recently 
created a toolkit for uni-
versity students which pro-
vides them with materials 
to create clubs to improve 
their negotiation skills. 
Participants can also serve 
as mentors for girls in eco-
nomically disadvantaged 
communities.   
Throughout the semester, a group of Carnegie Mellon students co-organized the Museum of Broken Relationships which, showcases items that tell stories of failed relationships. There have been 40 exhibits in 25 countries 
which makes Pittsburgh its 41st collaboration since the museum opened in 2006. The exhibit opened at The Mine Factory on Dec. 3. Editor’s note: The Tartan’s Forum Editor, SInead Foley helped to organize the museum.

CMU’s second annual Giving Tuesday breaks previous records
Richard Thaler discusses the importance of behavioral economics 
ZACHARY GOLDSTEIN
Staffwriter
Richard Thaler, one of the 
most accomplished behavioral 
economists in the world, came 
to Carnegie Mellon on Thurs-
day to give a lecture on “The 
Past, Present, and Future” of 
his ?eld of study. In the talk, 
Thaler described his debates 
with skeptics of behavioral 
economics, illustrated fasci-
nating examples of human 
irrationality, and outlined his 
vision for improving econom-
ics by making the ?eld more 
evidence-based. 
Thaler, a professor at 
the University of Chicago’s 
Booth School of Business, is 
renowned for co-authoring 
Nudge: Improving Decisions 
about Health, Wealth, and 
Happiness with Cass Sunstein, 
a law professor at Harvard 
University. The book explains 
how insights from behav-
ioral economics can be used 
to make better public policy, 
and was one in?uence that led 
to the creation of the White 
House’s Social and Behav-
ioral Sciences team and the 
equivalent Behavioral Insights 
unit in the UK. Both of these 
teams draw from research 
conducted by behavioral econ-
omists like Thaler to make 
government services more 
effective and cost-ef?cient. 
Thaler began his talk by 
explaining that even econo-
mists like Adam Smith and 
John Maynard Keynes, who 
lived long before the modern 
?eld of behavioral economics 
rose to prominence, incorpo-
rated insights from psychol-
ogy into their work and rec-
ognized that humans often 
behave irrationally. Econom-
ics was behavioral from the 
start; however, economists 
in the mid twentieth century 
failed to develop realistic mod-
els of human behavior, which 
led economists like Richard 
Thaler and psychologists like 
Daniel Kahneman and Amos 
Tversky to re-invent the ?eld 
of behavioral economics. 
Thaler also mentioned that 
the late Herbert Simon, who 
he described as a “legendary” 
Carnegie Mellon professor 
(after whom half of Newell-
Simon Hall is named) also 
played a pivotal role in the re-
vival of behavioral economics. 
Many amusing examples 
of how people behave irratio-
nally were sprinkled through-
out the talk. In one example, 
which resulted in laughter 
from the audience, Thaler 
displayed a graph show-
ing the changes over time in 
the price of a stock with the 
abbreviation CUBA. Despite 
the fact that the stock has 
no connection to the carib-
bean country, investors in this 
stock nevertheless responded 
to political events such as 
President Obama’s announce-
ment of the easing of bilateral 
relations in 2014 and more 
recently, the death of Fidel 
Castro with huge ?uctuations 
in stock price. In another ex-
ample, Thaler illustrated his 
claim that default settings 
matter by telling the audience 
that on his ?ight to Pittsburgh, 
he observed that the majority 
of passengers were watching 
CNBC — the channel that the 
in-?ight TVs were set to by 
default.
A consistent theme in 
Thaler’s talk was that many 
economists, even today, are 
skeptical of behavioral eco-
nomics research and dismiss 
the ?eld’s ?ndings by using 
“explainawaytions” — a term 
coined by Harvard Univer-
sity behavioral economist 
Matthew Rabin that refers to 
?awed criticisms of behavioral 
economics. 
Thaler concluded his talk 
by predicting that eventually, 
all economists will include 
evidence-based psychological 
insights in their work. In Thal-
er’s words, “All of econom-
ics will be as behavioral as it 
should be.”

For the second year in a 
row, Carnegie Mellon broke 
university fundraising records 
on #givingCMUday as part 
of the university’s participa-
tion in the international do-
nor holiday, #GivingTuesday. 
This was Carnegie Mellon’s 
third year participating in the 
global day of giving that was 
originally started in 2012 by 
New York community cultural 
center 92nd Street Y. For the 
event, Carnegie Mellon en-
couraged constituents all over 
the world to donate to univer-
sity funds, incentivizing par-
ticipation with challenges on 
social media and with events 
on campus.
The Of?ce of Alumni 
Relations and Annual Giv-
ing initially brought the 
event to campus in 2014, 
bringing out 533 donors. In 
2015, Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents, parents, alumni, staff, 
and faculty nearly doubled 
that benchmark and broke 
a university record for most 
donations received in one 
day, totaling 1,209. This year, 
the same community turned 
out to break that record again, 
boasting 1,350 donations that 
added up to $227,849.
As with years past, the 
Of?ce largely carried out the 
events through social media. 
They conducted six pre-an-
nounced challenges and one 
pop-up challenge via social 
media, including Facebook, 
Twitter, and Instagram. The 
challenges asked participants 
to hashtag photos of them-
selves in Carnegie Mellon 
swag, share their favorite spot 
on campus, re?ect on their 
Carnegie Mellon experience, 
and shout out what makes 
them proud to be a Tartan. 
Prizes for randomly selected 
winners included $500 to a 
campus fund of their choice, 
and, new this year, the op-
portunity to have lunch with 
President Suresh and Mrs. 
Suresh or participate in a tour 
of the steam tunnels with Vice 
President of Student Affairs 
and Dean of Students Gina 
Casalegno.
Also on social media, 
junior math major and Assis-
tant Director for Donational 
Transparency on the Student 
Body President’s cabinet, Ol-
ivia Cannizzaro, hosted Face-
book Live events throughout 
the day. One video featured 
two organizations that were 
awarded $500 prizes in last 
years challenges. Sophomore 
statistics major Emily Chen 
from service organization 
CMU Juntos, described how 
their prize allowed them to 
purchase construction ma-
terials to build latrines for 
a community in Nicaragua, 
and senior saxophone perfor-
mance major Laurel Beatty 
from School of Music’s Heri-
tage Scholarship, shared that, 
during the last Giving CMU-
day, their campaign reached 
the $50,000 benchmark that 
allowed their scholarship to 
be endowed. 
On campus, 
representatives from the 
Of?ce of Annual Giving tabled 
in the Cohon Center, asking 
students to post a sticky note 
with the name of a campus 
fund that deserves a $500 gift. 
Six of those sticky notes were 
awarded $500. Each college 
also hosted its own events in 
their buildings across cam-
pus, promoting the spirit of 
giving back. 
New to the lineup this year 
was the kickoff event Plaid 
Palooza. At midnight, ?rst 
thing on Tuesday, over 100 
students gathered in Rangos 
to enjoy tacos and popcorn, 
music, a photo booth to share 
photos on social media with 
the day’s hashtag, and an 
educational opportunity of-
fered by the Of?ce of Annual 
Giving to develop awareness 
of the day’s efforts and estab-
lish the transparency with the 
giving process. Two randomly 
selected students who posted 
photo booth pictures on so-
cial media were also selected 
to win $50 gift cards to the 
bookstore.
Another new initiative 
this year was the Presidential 
Student Donor Match. 
President Suresh established 
a fund of $25,000 to match 
undergraduate donations 
of $5 or more on #givingC-
MUday with a companion 
donation of $25 to the CMU 
Experience Fund. According 
to Director of Annual Giving 
Mary Ann McCollough, Presi-
dent Suresh has generously 
promised to continue to offer 
matching donations at differ-
ent amounts throughout the 
rest of the school year until 
the fund has been used. Mc-
Collough also shared that this 
Donor Match initiative came 
as the result of efforts from 
student Olivia Cannizzaro and 
Student Body Vice President 
and senior computer science 
major Aaron Gutierrez.
As the donations continue 
to be processed, the Of?ce will 
have more information about 
which organizations will re-
ceive each $500 award, but 
so far organizations ranging 
from CMU in Haiti to the Tre-
blemakers have been selected 
as winners of the social media 
challenges. The organization 
with the most unique donors 
giving $5 or more, and a ran-
domly selected organization 
with at least 15 donors giv-
ing $5 or more will also win a 
$500 prize.
According to McCollough, 
a donation to the univer-
sity on #givingCMUday is 
a meaningful expression of 
con?dence: “You spend more 
than $5 on a cup of coffee, or 
going out and having a beer 
on the weekend. However, 
taking that and directing it to 
the university in some fashion 
is really a vote of con?dence 
in this university and what it 
is doing for you as a student,” 
especially to funds that are 
not supported by tuition.
The donation form, which 
is Carnegie Mellon’s stan-
dard donation form hosted on  
www.giving.cmu.edu, gives 
donors the option to choose 
any campus fund ranging 
from academic departments 
and student activities, to 
athletic teams and Greek 
organizations.

The American federal 
government is built on a series of 
checks and balances. While the 
president is the most visible person 
in the American government, thier 
job is merely to enforce laws passed 
by Congress in a manner consistent 
with the Supreme Court’s interpre-
tation of the Constitution. 
However, politics are becoming 
increasingly polarized. Even politi-
cians opposed to their party estab-
lishments might vote against their 
party only once every three or four 
times, as in rare cases like Sen. Joe 
Manchin (D-WV) who opposes coal 
regulation despite his party’s sup-
port. But even in the case of the most 
extreme ?gures, like Sens. Ted Cruz 
(R-TX) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT), 
the internal opposition to the party 
still consistently votes with the par-
ty. With this in mind, Republican 
control of Congress combined with 
president-elect Donald Trump in 
the White House, where he is able to 
shape the Supreme Court, seems like 
it would make the Republican Party 
an unstoppable juggernaut.
Luckily, American government 
is intentionally decentralized. Total 
control of the federal government 
is a lot of power, but our local gov-
ernments form a meaningful line of 
defense from an unimpeded Trump.
Since the election, especially in 
the past week alone, Pittsburgh has 
reaf?rmed to its citizens that it will 
serve as this line of defense for them 
against an administration that cam-
paigned against their rights.
One example of this af?rmation 
happened on Nov. 29 when Pitts-
burgh City Council President Bruce 
Kraus and Councilman Dan Gilman 
moved to ban the use of conversion 
therapy on minors in Pittsburgh.
Conversion therapy is a brutal 
practice widely reviled in LGBTQ 
communities. The oft-mentioned 
electric shocks designed to condi-
tion LGBTQ children and teenagers 
out of their identities in Pavlovian 
fashion are only one form of conver-
sion therapy, but psychotherapy and 
groups designed to “pray the gay 
away” fall under the same category. 
All of them are considered to be 
pseudoscience and are known to be 
dangerous for the mental state of the 
person subjected to them.
Conversion therapy gained 
renewed prominence shortly af-
ter Trump’s selection of Indiana 
Governor Mike Pence to be his vice 
president. Pence has supported us-
ing federal dollars to support con-
version therapy in the past and has 
not backed off on that stance yet in 
this election.
According to a quote in the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Councilman 
Gilman “think[s] there was a new 
level of fear that was brought on by 
this election,” and the Council in-
tendes to respond to that fear on a 
local level.
For Council President Kraus, Pitts-
burgh’s ?rst openly gay politician, 
this ordinance is very personal. He 
shared in an interview with the Pitts-
burgh City Paper his memories as a 
third grader experiencing struggles 
with identity: “I do remember my 
parents seeking medical attention to 
help them understand who and what 
I was, and help me understand who 
and what I was.” And though his par-
ents never actually subjected him to 
conversion therapy, Kraus wants this 
ordinance to remind parents that, 
even though they may be confused, 
no good will come from efforts to 
change who their child is.
Mayor Bill Peduto also announced 
last week on Nov. 28 that he had ?-
nalized the makeup of Pittsburgh’s 
new LGBTQIA+ Advisory Coun-
cil, initially announced in August. 
The 15-member group, including 
Carnegie 
Mellon alumna 
Satvika Neti (DC 
‘16), will meet 
monthly in order 
to make policy 
recommendations 
to Mayor Peduto on 
how best to meet the 
needs of Pittsburgh’s LGBTQ 
constituency. The Council has 
also been tasked with writ-
ing an annual progress 
report, holding public 
forums, and serving as 
a contact point for commu-
nity members who wish to 
offer their input.
On Tuesday Nov. 29, 
City Council also an-
nounced a unanimously-
passed resolution that 
strongly recommends 
health care providers to encourage 
patients to get tested for HIV dur-
ing routine doctor’s of?ce visits. 
The resolution resulted from col-
laboration between the Council and 
the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force, and 
the announcement came right be-
fore World AIDS Day last week. This 
measure reinforces that Pittsburgh 
is not just invested in protecting its 
community from the outside, but 
improving it from within.
Furthermore, a PublicSource 
article published on Tuesday, Nov. 
29 reported that City Council intends 
to formalize a policy that would add 
Pittsburgh to the list of sanctuary 
cities in America where local police 
of?cers are prohibited from investi-
gating a person’s immigration status, 
leaving that responsibility to man-
power and funds from Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement since im-
migration policy is federal law, not 
local law. Pittsburgh already oper-
ates under a de facto sanctuary city 
policy, keeping local of?cials out of 
matters of immigration, but this pol-
icy would solidify this commitment.
The sanctuary city movement 
is the perfect example of local gov-
ernments upholding constitutional 
ideals of checks and balances, main-
taining a separation of powers that 
prevents incorrect authorities from 
unjustly targeting immigrants. In the 
face of Trump’s promised immigra-
tion policy, the move speaks even 
louder volumes. In Pennsylvania, 
House Bill No. 1885, which prom-
ises to put economic and criminal 
sanctions on cities in Pennsylvania 
that declare themselves sanctuary 
cities, passed by a large margin in 
the House. If it passes in the Senate, 
Governor Tom Wolf’s veto may not 
matter. Yet, despite these threats, 
Pittsburgh joined Philadelphia in de-
fying this dangerous attempt to sys-
tematize police racial pro?ling.
All in one week, both the City 
Council and Mayor’s Of?ce sent a 
strong message to their constituency 
with their actions. Pittsburgh’s of-
?cials are invested in the health and 
safety of its citizens, and will go to 
lengths to protect and defend those 
who need protection and defense. In 
the face of an uncertain national fu-
ture, we can be certain Pittsburgh’s 
administration remains ?rmly on the 
side of its people. 
Regardless of national and state 
election results, Allegheny County 
voted blue.

It’s 1979. The Iranian Hostage 
Crisis has just ended. There’s been 
a coup in Nicaragua, and a war 
between China and Vietnam. The 
world is complex, constantly shift-
ing between peace and tension in 
every region.
This was the state of the world 
when the Convention on the Elimi-
nation of All Forms of Discrimina-
tion against Women came in front 
of the U.N. Usually referred to as 
CEDAW, it came to fruition after 
thirty years of debate on women’s 
issues in the United Nations. 
The U.N. took several routes to 
examine the different perspectives 
and scenarios among their member 
countries. Commissions were cre-
ated and different Conventions were 
passed, eventually culminating in 
CEDAW. 
CEDAW was intended to serve 
as the central international agree-
ment on the rights of women and 
the protections that they need. It 
also lays out actions that should be 
done in order to ensure those pro-
tections. In a time when women’s 
rights were threatened across the 
globe, CEDAW was meant to help 
push positive change worldwide. 
It was signed and rati?ed by most 
countries, which should have been 
enough. It was enough for it to come 
into effect under the U.N.
However, what the U.N. says 
needs to happen doesn’t always 
quite ?lter into the world in the 
same way. CEDAW was missing 
something important, something 
that would have given it a weight it 
did not have.
The United States never rati?ed 
CEDAW. Without that tacit approval 
of a superpower country, it lacked 
a certain legitimacy. Rati?cation 
would require the entire Senate vote 
on the bill, with two thirds approv-
ing. However, CEDAW has never 
even appeared before the Senate for 
a vote. 
For context, most countries have 
approved of CEDAW — of member-
states, the only others who haven’t 
yet rati?ed are Iran, Sudan, Palau, 
Tonga, and Somalia. In the area of 
women’s rights, that’s not the best 
company to be in. In fact, there are 
so many countries with major hu-
man right’s violations who at least 
paid the lip-service of ratifying. The 
U.S. hasn’t even given it the chance 
of a vote.
That’s the main issue here — 
the fact that it hasn’t been in front 
of the Senate. The issue is that it’s 
very hard to vote against a women’s 
rights bill. Sure, there’s a question 
of United Nations interference in 
national law, but there’s 30 years of 
history to show that signing CEDAW 
won’t weaken the United States in 
any way. 
Other than U.N. overreach, there 
isn’t much cause to block without 
getting into hugely controversial 
issues. That’s why it has never been 
up to vote — ducking a vote is sig-
ni?cantly easier than casting a Nay 
vote in front of the country.
If you’re wondering what’s so 
controversial about CEDAW, the 
answer isn’t surprising. It’s what’s 
always controversial in terms of 
women’s issues in the United States. 
One of the actions CEDAW urges 
members to follow is providing ac-
cess to education on family planning 
as well as health services that may 
be pertinent. Reproductive matters 
can be hugely controversial in the 
United States, but words like abor-
tion are never used in CEDAW. It 
only mentions that information and 
health services should be available 
— there are no requirements as to 
what type.
Many of the other objections to 
CEDAW in the U.S. come in a similar 
vein. CEDAW is not a terribly spe-
ci?c document. Many of its terms 
can be interpreted in different ways, 
and allow each nation to determine 
the best course of action to achieve 
them. There isn’t any punishment 
for not completing them either. Any 
worries about the terms of CEDAW 
should be dissuaded by the wide 
range of countries that have rati?ed 
the convention. Even extremely 
conservative nations have rati?ed 
the convention, which would not 
have occurred if they were worried 
about the terms outlined clashing 
with their principles. And countries 
similar to the U.S., allies like Canada 
and Germany, have given it their 
approval as well.
CEDAW has accomplished some 
things since its passage. Laws 
against human traf?cking and do-
mestic violence have been passed 
around the world. More rights have 
been given to women in various 
countries. CEDAW has made a dif-
ference in the lives of many women.
And yet, that’s not enough. 
There’s more to do, and there are 
areas of the world where women 
don’t have the equality that CEDAW 
presses for. 
In the grand scheme of things, 
the United States has to consider so 
many factors in how it conducts its 
foreign affairs. The U.S. can’t simply 
decide that the choices of a nation 
are unacceptable and single-hand-
edly change them. But what the U.S. 
can do is ratify a document it should 
have rati?ed ages ago.
It’s been over three decades since 
CEDAW was presented to the United 
Nations. The U.S. is lagging behind 
other countries in demonstrating its 
concern for women’s issues. Giving 
CEDAW its chance in front of the 
Senate would show people around 
the world and here in the U.S. 
that the U.S. government does not 
dismiss these issues. 
It would add legitimacy to the 
document that the biggest super-
power in the world supported it. It’s 
time to give CEDAW the chance in 
the Senate that it should have had a 
long time ago.
U.S. must stop stalling global women’s rights
The United States never rati?ed 
CEDAW... For context, most countries 
have approved of CEDAW — of [U.N.] 
member-states, the only others who 
haven’t yet rati?ed are Iran, Sudan, 
Palau, Tonga, and Somalia. In the area 
of women’s rights, that’s not the best 
company to be in.

SHANTANU CHHABRA
Junior Staffwriter
Let’s face it, most of us are hard 
workers here — it’s the reason we’re 
at Carnegie Mellon. College is not for 
everyone, and we wouldn’t be here 
if the people in Warner Hall didn’t 
think we could handle the stress that 
comes with being at Carnegie Mel-
lon. We are a very stressed people 
— there’s no denying that, it’s been 
acknowledged and decried. In the 
aftermath of the election results and 
with ?nals week upon us, stress lev-
els are probably soaring high right 
now. And the truth is — that’s ?ne. 
It’s okay to be stressed. It’s okay to be 
sad. It’s okay to be dejected. You’re 
de?nitely not alone. But here’s an-
other (rather ugly) truth — your 
?nals are still happening in a week, 
your project deadlines are not chang-
ing, and you need to positively and 
rationally respond to them.
So what do we do about the 
stress?
We’re not the only college in the 
world that’s stressed. I do agree we 
have our problems, but that’s a sub-
ject for another opinion piece alto-
gether. College is a stressful time. It 
makes sense and some stress is in-
evitable. But it is getting worse over 
time. On average, our parents were 
less stressed than we were. A recent 
study by The Huf?ngton Post showed 
that “the proportion of freshmen say-
ing they “occasionally or frequently 
feel overwhelmed” by all they had 
to do jumped to 34 percent last year, 
from 24 percent in 2005. Only half 
of 2015’s freshmen consider 
themselves “above average or 
better” in emotional health, 
continuing a skid from 63 per-
cent in 1985 and 54 percent 
in 2005.
I don’t know if there is a 
community-wide or economy-wide 
solution to ?xing these alarmingly 
high levels of stress — I really hope 
there is, and I hope we come up with 
something or that our legislators can 
do something about it. 
As for what is within our power 
and what we can do right now, I 
strongly believe the key to solving 
this problem at the grassroots is to 
talk about your problems. Talk about 
what bothers you with someone you 
can trust. It could be anyone — your 
signi?cant other, your friend, your 
parent, your House-
fellow, your RA, 
your TA, your 
advisor, or 
Counseling 
and Psycho-
logical Servic-
es (CaPS). 
More often 
than not, 
whoever 
you talk to will 
respond bet-
ter than you’d 
imagine. Talk-
ing your heart 
out even strengthens 
your relationship with that person.
How should I manage my time?
Our favorite Randy Pausch gave a 
76-minute talk on time management 
in 2007 at the University of Virginia. 
Most of what I’m going to say is, at its 
core, derived from there. Everyone 
has a different approach to managing 
time. I think what generally works 
well is a simple three step feedback 
loop: Plan, execute, and evaluate. 
The ?rst (and very important) step 
is to plan. I cannot state how impor-
tant this step is. Pausch summarized 
it in a very succinct way I couldn’t 
agree more with, “Failing to plan is 
planning to fail.” While planning, 
simply sorting tasks by their respec-
tive deadlines is the wrong way to go 
about managing your time. It’s more 
important to sort things by impor-
tance — something that’s intuitive to 
think about, but not trivial to imple-
ment in practice.
The second step which is prob-
ably the hardest, is to execute that 
plan. One technique that is known 
to make this step work well is to dis-
engage from all kinds of distractions. 
An hour of focused study is more 
productive than three hours of 
unfocused work full of dis-
tractions. So if you want 
to be really productive, 
putting the phone 
away for an hour 
or two is probably 
a good idea. 
The ?nal step is to 
evaluate — to ask 
questions like “What 
went wrong?” 
and “What could I 
have done better?” 
Not only does this 
help you be more 
productive in the future, but it also 
helps you understand your work 
ethic better. Evaluation and feedback 
are the key to keep humanity going.
What if I blow my ?nals?
We’re not all perfect. We all have 
bad days, we all have tests and inter-
views that we wish could have gone 
better. Blowing your ?nals would 
affect your QPA. Your QPA could 
potentially affect your job prospects 
for certain ?elds. But not by much. 
As far as jobs go, companies have 
interviews for the very reason that 
they want to know the candidate and 
test his/her skills beyond just what 
transcripts and resumes say. Sure, 
you may need a respectable QPA to 
get an interview in the ?rst place, but 
beyond that point, your QPA doesn’t 
make or break the deal for the most 
part. And even so, for how long will 
your QPA do that? 
In the long run, next week does 
not matter. In the long run, your 
QPA does not matter. In the long run, 
your next summer’s internship does 
not matter. In the long run, all your 
achievements in college will not mat-
ter. From a career standpoint, what 
matters keeps changing and once 
you’re a few years away from col-
lege, people become more interested 
in what you worked on after college 
and how you used your learning from 
college. Of course, they will always 
be interested in how passionate you 
are about what you do, what kind of 
a person you are, and how you can 
make the world a better place. 
So instead of fretting about our 
grades and seeking higher grades, 
let’s focus on the learning 
because that’s what matters 
more. That’s what adds real 
skill. That’s what enables us to 
tackle and solve problems in 
the real world.

Standing Rock. It sounds like 
fortitude. Like endurance. The name 
invokes a sense of everlastingness, of 
proud stamina, a determination to be 
as eternal as the rock it is named for.
This is the name of a Native Amer-
ican Sioux tribe in North and South 
Dakota. It has also become the head-
line of an enormously contentious 
debate over Native American rights.
This battle is a bizarre match-up 
between the natural gas company En-
ergy Transfer Partners and the Stand-
ing Rock Sioux Tribe over a large plot 
of land in North Dakota.  
Energy Transfer is constructing 
the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,170-
mile pipeline that happens to be rout-
ed under the professedly sacred land 
of Standing Rock. Native Americans 
and other activists have been protest-
ing for months, in demonstrations 
that have occasionally turned violent, 
both on the side of the protestors and 
law enforcement.  Con?icts in these 
demonstrations have included throw-
ing rocks and even ?ring guns at po-
lice or security guards, who in turn 
have used pepper spray and hosing 
to subdue or disperse the crowd.  It 
has become a nationally-recognized 
David and Goliath narrative, merit-
ing the sympathy or condemnation 
of activists, politicians, and celebri-
ties alike, as well as the support of a 
peaceful protest in our own Schenley 
Plaza this past Saturday.  
However, as clean-cut as this story 
may appear — a big, heartless oil 
company bulldozing through sacred 
ground, and the small Native Ameri-
can tribe standing up to protect it — 
there are many nuances to the reality 
that render it much more complex, 
though not any less signi?cant and 
respected.  The Standing Rock Tribe’s 
motives for protest are twofold: the 
pipeline poses an environmental 
threat to their water as well as a des-
ecration of ancient burial grounds.
Since part of the pipeline cross-
es under the Mississippi River, the 
Standing Rock Tribe is concerned 
that it could cause disastrous dam-
age to their drinking water.  How-
ever, this is a misconception of how 
the pipeline essentially works — any 
leakage would seep downwards into 
the ground, rather than signi?cantly 
affecting the river water.  The greater 
concern, in fact, is that of any drink-
ing water wells nearby.  This drinking 
water would come from an aquifer, or 
an underground body of water, like-
ly a couple hundred feet below the 
pipeline.  Thus, if the pipeline runs 
anywhere near drinking water wells, 
the propane could potentially seep 
through the ground to the aquifer.
This concern, with its Erin 
Brockovich-esque undertones, is per-
fectly legitimate, but it is also impor-
tant to realize that there are already 
numerous federal agencies and sys-
tems in place for exactly this kind of 
situation.  The EPA closely regulates 
all real estate like this Dakota Access 
Pipeline, and has an almost excessive 
number of restrictions designed to 
protect the environment.  These gov-
ernmental systems are infamous for 
their strident protection of environ-
mental issues, and would never allow 
a company such as Energy Transfer 
to endanger the environment in any 
way.  In fact, these companies spend 
millions ensuring protection of the 
environment — not out of the kind-
ness of their hearts, but because the 
system is set up to force them to do 
so.  Considering how reliable this 
system is, it is important to consider 
that state and federal agencies have 
already approved the pipeline.  The 
only reasonable conclusion from 
that, with the knowledge of how 
highly regulated these projects are, is 
that the pipeline does not pose a sig-
ni?cant environmental threat.
The cultural threat, however, is a 
different story.  Imagine a construc-
tion crew arriving to route a drain 
pipe through your family’s cemetery, 
and you may understand the reaction 
of the Standing Rock Tribe to this Da-
kota Access Pipeline project.  Burial 
ground is sacred to every people, 
regardless of culture or ethnic back-
ground.  However, the essential prob-
lem, in this case, is that the Sioux 
Tribe does not own this ground; it is 
next to their reservation, but not le-
gally a part of their land.
In just the past ?fty years, the 
American government has become 
very sympathetic to the causes of 
Native Americans; quite understand-
ably, given their tragically unjust 
history.  The government also has a 
privilege called “eminent domain,” in 
which it has the right to appropriate 
any land for the sake of the public.  It 
is therefore its responsibility to take 
possession of sacred land and give 
it to the Native Americans.  So why 
hasn’t the government done so before 
now?  Why isn’t this sacred ground 
already a part of the reservation?
This is the oddest part of the de-
bate, and where the con?ict ulti-
mately lies: the government did not 
deem this land to be culturally sig-
ni?cant, and the Standing Rock Tribe 
claims that their reviews of the land 
were inadequate.  If the reviews had 
yielded stronger results, there would 
have been no way for Energy Trans-
fer to build there.  All companies are 
required to contact the Department 
of Native American Affairs multiple 
times in planning a construction 
project, and if any ancient burial 
grounds are found there, the project 
is shut down or rerouted.  Period.
This super?cially simple debate 
is clearly much more complex than 
many realize, but the determination 
of Standing Rock to protect the land 
of their ancestors is unquestionably 
admirable.  While the environmen-
tal concern is likely unfounded, the 
cultural signi?cance that they believe 
lies in their land should be respected 
regardless of any governmental re-
port, especially considering the his-
tory of Native Americans in this land.  
The pictures and videos of protesters 
versus police that have been circulat-
ing for months, some very violent, 
are disturbingly reminiscent of the 
massacres of Native Americans in this 
country’s history.  
While law enforcement was justi-
?ed in removing the protestors from 
private property or blocking high-
ways, it is nonetheless an extremely 
volatile situation that should best be 
resolved with some sort of conces-
sion on the part of the oil company. 
Energy Transfer is not stupid, nor is 
it suicidal.  It is aware of how public 
opinion affects its brand.  Although 
it may cost this company millions of 
dollars, it must realize that this land 
is priceless.

The nationwide 
“Fight For $15” 
movement hit its 
?rst major mile-
stone last month 
when it managed 
to push McDon-
ald’s into announc-
ing that it would 
be rolling out touch-
screen self-ordering kiosks 
into all 14,000 of its national 
locations. Economists long 
predicted that this could be 
the effect of increasing the 
minimum wage, but ?nally, 
the push for a wage high 
enough that businesses can-
not realistically support it 
has materialized this.
In an article for Forbes, 
Ed Rensi, the former presi-
dent and CEO of McDonald’s 
Corp believes that McDon-
ald’s decision is a direct result 
of rising wages and the “Fight 
For $15” movement. To back 
this, he cites a claim that a quar-
ter of restaurant closures in the Bay 
Area were attributed to increasing 
employee wages. 
The restaurant business has al-
ways been one with a low pro?t 
margin, and a look into food fran-
chises shows just how much of a 
reality this is. According to a report 
by Franchise Business Review, 51.5 
percent of food franchises earn less 
than $50,000 a year, with the aver-
age pro?t of all restaurants being 
around $82,033. According to the 
Carnegie Mellon School of Com-
puter Science, the average salary 
of one of their graduates comes in 
at $108,955. That means that right 
out of college, a student can already 
make signi?cantly more than some-
one who has taken the enormous 
risk and investment of opening a 
restaurant — and that’s with the 
current nation-wide minimum wage 
of $7.25.
If the $15 minimum wage result-
ed in a number of closures in the Bay 
Area, one of the most expensive areas 
in the United States, imagine what it 
would do to small towns and cities 
with a signi?cantly lower cost of liv-
ing. To equate this, let’s compare the 
standard of living in San Francisco 
to that in Harlington, Texas. Accord-
ing to CBS News, Harlington is the 
town with the lowest cost of living in 
the United States. At $15 an hour, a 
cashier at McDonald’s would make 
around $30,000. If this salary was 
made by a resident in Harlington, 
Texas, according to PayScale’s cost 
of living calculator, this would be 
the equivalent of making $59,415 in 
San Francisco.
The fact that money literally goes 
twice as far in Harlington as San 
Francisco shows just how ridicu-
lous the concept of a national mini-
mum wage is if too high. Countless 
movements are calling out the $15 
minimum wage in San Francisco as 
their working example, but they fail 
to show that making $15 an hour in 
San Francisco is the same as mak-
ing $7.57 an hour in Harlington. 
If restaurants have already begun 
automating restaurants in places 
like California, imagine what they 
would do in towns like Harlington if 
they were forced to pay all of their 
employees over $15 an hour.
The bene?ts of automation are 
clear to businesses — more ef?-
ciency, no sick days, no protests, a 
?xed cost that could be elapsed by 
the wages of a worker in less than 
a year, and in many cases, an im-
proved customer experience. That 
being said, we should be doing all 
that we can to ensure that Ameri-
cans continue to have jobs in a sector 
that accounts for nearly 10 percent 
of total jobs in the nation according 
to restaurant.org. Because America 
is a nation with a vast variation in 
cost of living from city to city, such 
policies should be made on the city 
level, not nationally. The “Fight For 
$15” movement is one led by some 
of the cities with the highest cost 
of living in the nation with little 
thought into the implications that 
such a policy may have for areas of 
less economic wealth.

The phrase “glass ceiling” is a 
popular terminology, and for good 
reason. The term is de?ned by the 
Merriam-Webster Dictionary as “an 
intangible barrier within a hierarchy 
that prevents women or minorities 
from obtaining upper-level posi-
tions.” We talk about glass ceilings 
in politics, in STEM ?elds, and in the 
military, but one ?eld that is often 
overlooked is music.
The glass ceiling in music is 
particularly prevalent in the world of 
symphony orchestras. Old biases and 
stereotypes continue to prevail in au-
ditions for percussionists, brass play-
ers, and string bass players as these 
sections have continued to be pre-
dominantly male. Blind auditions, 
auditions where players are seated 
behind a screen so the audition 
board can only hear, not see them, 
have helped reduce gender biases to 
an extent. 
However, these auditions have 
gotten to the point where musicians 
must take off their shoes in some cas-
es so adjudicators cannot guess sex 
based on heel clicks. Why should the 
sex of a musician have anything to do 
with whether they are hired are not? 
What creates an environment where 
measures to prevent this basis have 
to be this extreme? 
Of all the orchestras out there the 
Vienna Philharmonic is the one that 
has caused the most outrage with re-
gard to gender discrimination. The 
Vienna Philharmonic is a world re-
nowned orchestra whose work has 
been adored by classical music lov-
ers since the orchestra’s early begin-
nings. The fatal ?aw of the group, 
though, is the fact that it did not 
have any female members until 1997 
for no other reason than they were a 
male-exclusive group. Although this 
situation has been slowly improving 
in the past decade, the fact that an 
orchestra of such high regard was 
able to hold on to such backwards 
principles for so long is infuriating.
The place in the orchestra where 
progress towards equality is still 
painfully slow is on the conduc-
tor’s podium. Orchestras have used 
designated conductors since the 
early 1800s. Prior to this, one of the 
musicians would typically serve as a 
leader, conducting with one hand or 
through small gestures of the body 
or instrument. Moving into the 19th 
century, a designated conductor 
became an absolute necessity as or-
chestras grew larger and new scores 
with added complexity were near im-
possible to perform without a leader 
pulling the musicians all together.
For as long as conductors have 
been around there has always 
seemed to be a shortage of female 
conductors. Now, there is no logical 
reason for this. Women have been 
accomplished musicians for as long 
as men have. What is most appalling, 
however, is how strongly this basis 
continues to prevail into the modern 
century.
In 2007, Marin Alsop was 
appointed as the conductor of the 
Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. This 
was a historical moment because, up 
until this point, no woman had ever 
served as the conductor of a major 
U.S. orchestra. Now, almost one de-
cade later, Alsop is still the singular 
female conductor of a top-tier United 
States orchestra. 
The next time you look up at the 
gorgeous ceiling of a concert hall, 
know that the glass ceiling there is 
only beginning to see cracks appear, 
but one day that ceiling will shatter 
and come raining down in sparkling 
glory.

Engine turns waste hot water into electricity
Exergyn, a ?rm based in 
Dublin, Ireland, has created a 
new engine called the Exergyn 
Drive, that turns waste hot wa-
ter into electricity, which will 
help to reduce carbon emis-
sions and energy consumption 
in a variety of companies.
“There’s just so much waste 
hot water in the world,” said 
Exergyn CEO Alan Healy. “In 
most cases [companies] are 
actually spending energy to 
cool it.”
This type of engine is 
particularly useful for cargo 
ships, which typically pump 
waste hot water around the 
vessels to cool their engine 
down. Recycling this waste 
hot water in an ef?cient man-
ner will help reduce both costs 
and carbon emissions.
The Exergyn Drive uses 
nitinol, an alloy of nickel and 
titanium that undergoes a 
phase transition when heated 
and reverts back to its original 
shape. When cooled, nitinol 
expands, similar to water and 
ice. In the Drive itself, nitinol 
wires attached to a piston are 
?ushed with hot and cold wa-
ter, expanding and contract-
ing the wires to create a piston 
movement.
From 200 kilowatts of 
thermal energy in the waste 
hot water, the engine produc-
es 10 kilowatts of electricity. 
Exergyn plans to run indus-
trial trials next year. This en-
gine can revolutionize the way 
companies deal with waste.

False news ?oods social media, affects public opinion
In the aftermath of the 
2016 U.S. presidential elec-
tion, fake news has ?ooded 
social media, making it in-
credibly dif?cult to discern 
fact from ?ction. An analysis 
published in First Monday, 
the peer-reviewed journal of 
the internet, by University of 
Southern California computer 
scientists found that nearly 
20 percent of election-related 
tweets came from social media 
bots. A social media bot is any 
computer program that poses 
as a real person. 
The abstract from the study 
claims, “The presence of social 
media bots can indeed nega-
tively affect democratic politi-
cal discussion rather than im-
proving it, which in turn can 
potentially alter public opin-
ion and endanger the integrity 
of the Presidential election.” 
However, even beyond 
politics, fake news can be 
catastrophic for science. Click-
bait headlines with fake news 
about “controversial” science 
topics such as climate change 
and vaccines can spread false 
information. With people un-
able to tell when information 
is not true, they may form 
opinions on a topic based on 
incorrect information.
According to cognitive 
scientist David Rapp of North-
western University, research 
shows that even if people ini-
tially know the news is false 
they will remember it to be 
true later.

Parkinson’s may be linked to gut microbe
Parkinson’s disease, a 
chronic, progressive move-
ment disorder, affects more 
than 10 million people world-
wide, of which 70 percent 
have gastrointestinal issues 
such as constipation. Often, 
gastrointestinal issues mani-
fest before neurological prob-
lems, but it was unclear as to 
whether there was a link be-
tween gut microbes and the 
disease itself.
This week, researchers 
published a report in Cell 
about how intestinal microbes 
send signals that set off Par-
kinson’s characteristic brain 
in?ammation and motor prob-
lems in mice.
The team conducted a 
study raising two kinds of 
mice. In both cases, the mice 
produced too much alpha-
synuclein, the protein that 
clumps in the brain and is be-
lieved to cause Parkinson’s. 
But one set of mice were raised 
to be germ-free while the oth-
er set was not. 
In the germ-free mice, the 
alpha-synuclein wasn’t clump-
ing in their brains, and they 
acted less sick. “Even though 
the mice that received the 
healthy microbiota received 
hundreds of bacteria, they 
didn’t get the disease,” said 
Mazmanian. These ?ndings 
could help researchers un-
derstand the mechanism of 
Parkinson’s disease and de-
velop new treatments for this 
disorder.

Perovskite solar cells hit new world ef?ciency records
Recently, engineers at the 
Australia’s University of New 
South Wales in Sydney have 
created perovskite solar cells 
that break new world records 
regarding energy conversion 
ef?ciency. At the Asia-Paci?c 
Solar Research Conference 
in Canberra this past Friday, 
Anita Ho-Baillie, a Senior Re-
search Fellow at the Australian 
Centre for Advanced Photovol-
taics (ACAP), announced the 
accomplishment.
The team’s perovskite solar 
cell is 16 square centimeters 
and has a 12.1 percent ef-
?ciency rating, which was 
independently con?rmed by 
Newport Corp in Montana. 
The team’s 1.2 square centi-
meter cell has an 18 percent 
ef?ciency rating.
Perovskite is a compound 
containing a hybrid organic-
inorganic lead or tin halide. 
The compound is cheap and 
simple to manufacture and is 
very versatile.
“This is a very hot area of 
research, with many teams 
competing to advance photo-
voltaic design,” said Ho-Bail-
lie. “Perovskites came out of 
nowhere in 2009, with an ef-
?ciency rating of 3.8 percent, 
and have since grown in leaps 
and bounds. These results 
place UNSW amongst the best 
groups in the world producing 
state-of-the-art high-perfor-
mance perovskite solar cells. 
And I think we can get to 24 
percent within a year or so.”

Europe presses ahead with plans for Mars rover
Europe now has plans to 
put a robotic rover assembled 
in the United Kingdom on 
Mars by the year 2021. In a 
meeting in Lucerne, Swit-
zerland, research ministers 
agreed to fund the 436 million 
euro project. Because of the 
cost and timing, there is fear 
the European Space Agency 
(ESA) may drop the project.
However, the research 
ministers both con?rmed their 
desire for the project and that 
European involvement in the 
International Space Station 
would continue through 2024.
“We need inspiration for 
the future. Inspiration is a 
driver, and from inspiration 
and fascination come motiva-
tion. And for me, it’s very clear 
we are responsible for the mo-
tivation of the next generation 
to create the future,” said Jan 
Woerner, the director general 
of ESA.
Getting the rover to Mars 
is the second part of a two-
part project called ExoMars. 
The ?rst part of this project 
was getting a satellite to Mars 
to explore different gases in 
the planet’s atmosphere that 
may come from other-world 
microbes.
“Nobody else is doing the 
science that is planned for 
ExoMars, drilling below the 
surface of the planet for the 
?rst time” said David Parker, 
the director of human space-
?ight and robotic exploration 
at ESA.

Evidence shows supernova formed our solar system
New evidence has emerged 
from a scientist at Monash 
University that uses data from 
meteorites and a new comput-
er model to suggest that the 
formation of our solar system 
was triggered by a low-mass 
supernova.
Our solar system was 
formed around 4.6 billion 
years ago after a cloud of gas 
and dust was disturbed; the re-
sulting gravitational collapse 
enabled the formation of a 
protostar, which later became 
our Sun, and the surrounding 
disc where the planets were 
born. One of the cosmic events 
that would have enough en-
ergy to cause the gravitational 
collapse would be a superno-
va, when a star explodes at the 
end of its life cycle.
“Before this model there 
was only inconclusive evi-
dence to support this theory,” 
said Alexander Heger, a pro-
fessor at the Monash School of 
Physics and Astronomy.
The researchers focused 
on radioactive nuclei in the 
decay products of modern me-
teorites that were only present 
during the early years after 
the solar system’s formation. 
These nuclei have a very short 
life span, and could only have 
come from a supernova.
The study was published in 
Nature Communications.

New epilepsy drugs block electrical signals in the brain
EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
Epilepsy is a recurrent, 
chronic disorder of the brain 
characterized by repeated 
seizures, which can endan-
ger the person in a variety of 
situations due to uncontrolled 
movement and put them at in-
creased risk of certain health 
conditions, not to mention the 
stigma that is associated with 
epilepsy in some cultures. 
Furthermore, seizures can be 
fatal if they cause breathing 
problems, choking, drowning, 
or serious injury.
In about three-quarters of 
epileptic patients, the epilepsy 
can be controlled fairly effec-

for the other quarter of pa-

HOW THINGS WORK
PUGWASH
Industry needs academics
RUIHAO YE
Special to The Tartan
Research has always 
been under intense pres-
sures from the sociopolitical 
and economic states, but in 
recent years an increasing 
trend of corporate involve-
ment has crept into this pro-
cess with questionable re-
sults. When one considers 
industry-academia partner-
ships, some may imagine the 
majesty of historical indus-
trial research giants, like Bell 
Labs, to current Information 
Age mini-academia research 
districts, like California’s 
Silicon Valley.  Others may 
harbor reasonable doubt, 
with reports of dubious re-
search produced at agenda 
riddled institutions like the 
European Hydration Institute 
or the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute. Without a doubt, it 
is important to consider the 
nature of such institutions as 
they become prevalent and 
stronger in the coming years.
First, as noted by one of the 
members of Pugwash, there 
is a distinction to be made 
between types of industry 
research. Direct research in-
cludes projects, such as those 
done by Shell, in which re-
search would lead to a direct, 
marketable product or result.
On the other hand, 
indirect research, done by in-
stitutions such as the Compet-
itive Enterprise Institute, uses 
funds to conduct research on 
less tangible or less directly 
marketable products, instead 
developing results that affect 
the ef?cacy of their product or 
other research that may have 
long-term pro?tability.
There are many examples 
that question the relationship 
between industry and aca-
demia around these two styles 
of research. For example, un-
der direct research, members 
discussed the role pro?t plays. 
One member brought up the 
Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency (DARPA) as 
a mix between government 
and corporate institution. 
He mentioned that DARPA 
encourages research in tech-
nologies that are directly of 
government interest, yet it 
may reorient towards indus-
trial direct research pro?t-
ability, resulting in a bridg-
ing between academic and 
industrial goals.
However, a different 
member voiced concern to-
wards the motive of pro?t. 
Speci?cally, she mentioned 
how the University of Pitts-
burgh (Pitt) decides funding 
departments and the alloca-
tion of grants. According to 
her, Exxon recently provided 
funding to Pitt’s Civil Engi-
neering department. How-
ever, this funding led to the 
defunding of some humani-
ties departments. Also, she 
commented that grant money 
awards were being tied to 
the salary of requesters, but 
as a result was disadvanta-
geous to those in Humanities 
programs.
Turning towards indirect 
research, one member men-
tioned the idea of Silicon 
Valley contributing to in-
formation and computer 
technologies. Companies in 
Silicon Valley are interested in 
pro?t, but they are also inter-
ested in funding research into 
strategies and techniques to 
further increase the viability 
of those technologies.
This work is never too far 
from pro?t, though. For ex-
ample, Disney research revo-
lutionized snow physics for 
their ?lm Frozen. 
Such work may be physi-
cally intangible, but the 
awards given to works utiliz-
ing said tech can drive tangi-
ble product and sales. Again, 
in this case the primary mo-
tive is pro?t and not knowl-
edge. Such a schism between 
industrial and academic re-
search motivation should be 
noted. It is unlikely that Dis-
ney would research a ?eld of 
computer graphics that could 
not be translated into pro?t at 
some point.
In the end, the relationship 
between research and indus-
try is a rocky one with many 
bene?ts and drawbacks. But 
it does seem that the direction 
of this relationship is shaped 
more by the desires of those 
on top than a strict commen-
tary on the nature of the rela-
tion. And as summarized by 
one member, it is up to the 
leadership of both academia 
and industry, current and fu-
ture, to determine the orien-
tation that this relationship 
takes.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy educational forum 
for the purpose of discussing 
the implications of STEM on 
ethics and policy.  This article 
is a summary of last week’s 
topic of academic-industrial 
relations.

Since allowing customers 
to hail self-driving cars in 
mid-September, Uber’s futur-
istic vehicles have become a 
common sight around Pitts-
burgh. With their roofs chock 
full of cameras and spinning 
sensors, they’re pretty easy 
to spot. But what are all those 
gadgets actually doing?
The most distinctive part 
of Uber’s self-driving technol-
ogy, and the cornerstone of 
its navigation, is the Light De-
tection and Ranging (LiDAR) 
unit, or what most laymen 
would refer to as the spinny 
part on top. The unit is meant 
to map the car’s surroundings 
in 3D with minute detail so 
the car is aware of any objects 
surrounding, it like parked 
cars, buildings, pedestrians, 
or debris in the road. LiDAR 
works by ?ring a laser at an 
object and measuring the 
time it takes for the light to 
bounce back to the sensor on 
the LiDAR unit, thus mapping 
the location of the object. Be-
cause light travels at a con-
stant and known speed, it’s 
easy to calculate the distance 
to the object once the light’s 
travel time is known.
The LiDAR unit on top of 
Uber’s self-driving cars ?res 
1.4 million laser points per 
second to build a picture of 
the car’s environment. It is 
placed on top of the car so 
the lasers can have as far of a 
reach as possible, unobstruct-
ed by pedestrians or other 
cars. The car also has four less 
powerful LiDAR units placed 
on the front, rear, and sides of 
the car to cover blind spots.
LiDAR’s main bene?t is its 
accuracy. Before the advent 
of LiDAR technology, radar, 
which uses radio waves in-
stead of light waves, was most 
commonly used for detecting 
and mapping objects. At 500 
feet from its source a radar 
beam disperses to a width of 
150 feet, while a laser beam 
is only 18 inches wide at the 
same distance. This makes a 
huge difference for self-driv-
ing cars, where being a few 
feet off on an object’s location 
can lead to an accident.
Radar also ?nds its place 
in self-driving cars, however. 
While LiDAR is accurate in 
detecting the shape and de-
tails of objects, its Achilles 
heel is accurately monitoring 
the speed of surrounding ve-
hicles. Uber’s cars are out?t-
ted with two radar units on 
its bumpers that provide 360° 
coverage and detect the speed 
of other vehicles on the road 
in real time. The data from 
these radar units also serves 
as a crosscheck for the LiDAR 
data. Automobile technology 
relies on redundancies and 
cross checks for safety, since 
a malfunction can have tragic 
results.
The wave-based object 
detection technology is sup-
plemented with 20 cameras 
placed around the car. The 
colored camera placed just 
below the largest LiDAR unit 
on top of the car plays the vi-
tal role of putting the LiDAR 
map into color so the car can 
see traf?c lights. The cameras 
around the car pick up far 
more data than the other sen-
sors, including color and tex-
ture. The problem comes with 
interpreting the overwhelm-
ing amount of data cameras 
pick up. 
With all of these sensors 
telling the car exactly where 
it is, it still needs to ?gure out 
where it’s going. That is where 
the rest of the technology clut-
tering the top of the car comes 
in. The back of the car’s hood 
is covered with a collection of 
antenna that allows it to posi-
tion itself via the Global Posi-
tioning System (GPS). The car 
receives precise information 
from at least three of the 30 
satellites orbiting the Earth 
as part of the GPS network on 
its exact position and current 
time, and uses the overlap of 
the three satellites’ ranges 
to pinpoint its location. This 
method, called trilateration, 
is accurate within several me-
ters and is effective in most 
scenarios.
However, several meters 
can make a world of differ-
ence for an automated car 
driving without human su-
pervision. Uber has combated 
this problem by restricting 
their self-driving Ubers to cer-
tain routes and having them 
supervised by a vehicle man-
ager behind the wheel at all 
times. 
Google, which is also 
developing a self-driving 
car, has taken a different 
approach. Google has pre-
mapped all of the 700,000 
miles of road it allows the 
cars to drive on with exquisite 
detail, including everything 
from potholes to curb heights. 
When a self-driving car is ac-
tually on the road, its GPS po-
sition is matched with sensor 
map data previously collected 
in the same spot and adjusted 
accordingly. 
Both Google and Uber’s 
strategies for dealing with 
the positioning problem have 
their ?aws. Uber’s strategy 
limits the car’s ?exibility and 
keeps it from being fully au-
tonomous of a human driver, 
while Google’s strategy re-
stricts cars to mapped road-
ways. And while 700,000 
miles may sound like a lot, 
there are over 4 million miles 
of public roads in the U.S.
Uber’s self-driving cars 
combine an amazing array of 
technology to navigate their 
surroundings, and even more 
technology to make decisions 
based on the information they 
detect. While fully autono-
mous cars may still be far off, 
the technology being used to-
day drives home the fact that 
we’re living the future.
Researchers discover each individual has unique brain
JOSH ANDAH
Staffwriter
Everyone is unique, and 
science has con?rmed this. 
Researchers at Carnegie Mel-
lon University successfully 
mapped nearly 700 human 
brains, ?nding that they all 
are unique from each other. 
The study, published last 
month in PLOS Computational 
Biology, was conducted by as-
sistant professor of neurosci-
ence and ?rst-author Fang-
Cheng Yeh.
The researchers generated 
these maps, called connec-
tomes, and found that they 
are distinct from person-to-
person, so much so that they 
were used to identify indi-
viduals at nearly 100 percent 
accuracy. 
Researchers could even 
tell identical twins apart; in 
a Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity press release, it was re-
vealed that “Identical twins 
only share about 12 percent 
of structural connectivity 
patterns” in common. Timo-
thy Verstynen, an assistant 
professor of psychology and 
co-author of the study, noted 
that “this con?rms some 
things that we’ve al-
ways assumed in 
neuroscience 
— that 
connectivity patterns in your 
brain are unique to you.” 
In fact, an individual’s 
connectivity patterns over 
time are different. A connec-
tome changes at a rate of 13 
percent over a 100-day period, 
meaning daily experiences 
actively alter physical white-
matter networks in the brain 
— a biological phenomenon 
known as plasticity.
In the research study, 
brains were mapped using 
diffusion-weighted magnetic 
resonance imaging (DW-MRI) 
— a version of the MRI scan 
that monitors the diffusion of 
water molecules and other liq-
uids within tissue in order to 
generate highly detailed im-
ages of the brain. An MRI scan 
works by creating a magnetic 
?eld, then detecting resultant 
radio frequencies emitted by 
hydrogen atoms, mostly locat-
ed in bodily lipids and water. 
As water molecules interact 
with white matter — the pale 
tissue within the brain con-
sisting mostly of nerve ?bers 
— a precise map of the brain’s 
neural network, called a local 
connectome, is generated.
This discovery offers far 
more than a novel method of 
tracking identity. The ?ood 
gates of  formerly specula-
tive research ?elds have been 
opened. 
“Realistically, we would 
hope that this could be used 
to better understand how sub-
tle differences in the brain’s 
wiring can predict certain 
behaviors and (eventually) 
clinical pathologies,” said 
Verstynen in an article by The 
Huf?ngton Post. 
Researchers now have the 
material opportunity to ef-
fectively observe the changes 
in the brain that cause af?ic-
tions such as Alzheimer’s dis-
ease and Parkinson’s disease 
— an arduous feat without 
DM-MRI technology. Per-
sonal identi?cation using this 
technology is not ruled out for 
the future. At the moment, 
however, it is far too expen-
sive, cumbersome, and slow 
to use it for such a purpose.
This research was funded 
by the U.S.’s Army Research 
Laboratory. Alongside Yeh 
and Verstynen, the research 
was co-authored by Jean M. 
Vettel of the Army Research 
Laboratory; Aarti Singh and 
Barnabas Poczos, associate 
professors of machine learn-
ing at Carnegie Mellon; Scott 
T. Grafton of the University 
of California, Santa Barbara; 
Kirk I. Erickson of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh; and Wen-
Yih I. Tseng of the National 
Taiwan University.
The brain is 
inexplicably complex, 
and is arguably the 
least understood or-
gan in the body. 
This research de-
mysti?es the elu-
sive organ ever so 
slightly, allowing 
science to pick at 
the mind. More-
over, it con?rms 
what has always 
been known — 
everyone has a 
unique mind.

Women’s Swimming & Diving
 
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s swimming and div-
ing team ?nished the Kenyon 
College Total Performance 
Sports Camp Invitational 
on Saturday with ?rst-year 
Emma Nicklas-Morris setting 
two new school records and 
senior Machika Kaku setting 
the record on the 3-meter div-
ing board.
The Tartans ?nished fourth 
with 1,081.5 points and ahead 
of Division I Davidson Col-
lege and Division III DePauw 
University. The University of 
Pennsylvania won the meet 
with 2,665 points.
Kaku dove to a career-
best score of 492.70 on the 
3-meter board to win the 
event and top the previous 
school record (473.55) set by 
Julie Pavia in 2006. Nicklas-
Morris’s ?rst  record of the 
day came in the preliminaries 
of the 200-yard breaststroke 
when she touched in 2:21.54 
to also record a NCAA pro-
visional mark. In the ?nals, 
she touched ninth in 2:22.17. 
Junior Kim Hochstedler was 
10th in 2:24.08.
The second school record 
of the day for Nicklas-Morris 
was in the 200-yard individual 
medley. She had the top time 
of the preliminaries when she 
touched in a provisional quali-
fying time of 2:04.55 to break 
the record set by Molly Evans 
in 2011. She ?nished second 
overall in the ?nals with a time 
of 2:05.45.
First-year Teagan Goforth 
earned a place in the A-Final 
of the 200-yard backstroke 
and ?nished sixth overall with 
a NCAA provisional qualifying 
time of 2:04.17. Junior Emma 
Shi won the B-Final by touch-
ing the wall in 2:05.28.
First-year Taylor Brown 
reached the evening ?nals of 
the 500-yard freestyle with a 
season-best time of 5:14.41 
during the preliminaries and 
surpassed the time in the ?-
nals to place 23rd in 5:10.88. 
Junior Miranda Ford also 
made the ?nals and ?nished 
25th in 5:19.70. Her morning 
swim of 5:16.38 was a season 
best. 
The 100-yard butter?y was 
led by senior Gillian Crews, 
who won the B-Final with a 
time of 57.24. Junior Mary 
St. John ?nished sixth in the 
same heat in 57.81 while se-
nior Shieri Suzuka was eighth 
in 57.95.
 Senior Allison Kirkby had 
the best swim of the day for 
the Tartans in the 100-yard 
freestyle Saturday night when 
she touched 22nd overall in a 
season-best 52.99.
The last event of the meet 
was the 400-yard freestyle re-
lay which the Tartan quartet 
of Nicklas-Morris, Shi, ?rst 
year Victoria Feng, and Kirkby 
?nished in 3:33.10 to place 
eighth overall in the event.
The Tartans will return 
to competition on Jan. 14 at 
home against Westminster 
College and SUNY Geneseo.
 
Men’s Swimming & Diving
 
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
swimming and diving team ?n-
ished the Kenyon College Total 
Performance Sports Camp In-
vitational on Saturday. The 
Tartans ?nished fourth overall 
with 1,022 points and ahead 
of Division I Davidson Col-
lege and Division III DePauw 
University. The University of 
Pennsylvania took the title 
with 2,572 points.
Sophomore Mitchell Riek 
cleared a provisional quali-
fying time in the 500-yard 
freestyle when he touched 
in a season-best 4:31.13 to 
place 12th overall. First-year 
Daniel won the C-Final of the 
same event to place 21st in a 
season-best time of 4:38.58.
Sophomore Gabe Bamforth 
topped his school record score 
achieved yesterday in the 
preliminaries of the 1-meter 
diving event with a score of 
531.35 in the ?nals Saturday 
to win the event.
Three Tartans swam in the 
B-Final of the 200-yard back-
stroke with junior Michael Di-
Bacco leading the way in 13th 
place in 1:54.84. 
First-year Ben Baxter and 
Richard Deng were just be-
hind him in 14th and 15th 
place, respectively, with times 
of 1:54.89 and 1:55.10.
Senior Sivan Mehta turned 
in a 50.22 performance in 
the 100-yard butter?y to ?n-
ish 12th while ?rst-year Ryan 
Fitzpatrick was 17th in 51.56 
and ?rst-year Preston Vander 
Vos was 18th in 51.63.
First-year swimmer Rip 
Lyster recorded a season-best 
time of 2:05.72 in the 200-
yard breaststroke when he 
touched 12th and just ahead 
of senior Brian Jay who was 
13th in 2:06.05.
One event later, Lyster 
returned to the pool in the 
200-yard IM and turned in a 
13th-place ?nish with a time 
of 1:53.62. His time of 1:52.76 
in the preliminaries is a team 
best for the year.
The Tartans placed sixth in 
the 400-yard freestyle relay to 
?nish the meet. First-year Sam 
Hawke, Deng, Mehta, and 
Riek touched in 3:04.48 and 
were 38-tenths of a second off 
from a provisional qualifying 
time.
The team will next take 
on Westminster College and 
SUNY Geneseo on Jan. 14.

Tartan women’s basketball scores over 100 after break
MARIKA YANG
Staffwriter
On Wednesday, the Carn-
egie Mellon University wom-
en’s basketball team rolled to 
another victory against the 
Mount Aloysius Mounties to 
continue their perfect season.
The Tartans began the 
?rst quarter with a hot streak, 
quickly gaining a lead over the 
Mounties with ef?cient pass-
ing, consistent defense, and a 
commitment to scoring in the 
paint. As the ?rst quarter en-
tered its ?nal minutes, Mount 
Aloysius began crawling back 
from an 11-point de?cit. The 
quarter ended with Carnegie 
Mellon leading the game with 
a score of 25–17.
The second quarter played 
out as the ?rst did, with the 
Tartans maintaining their 
momentum. Their strong de-
fense was on display as they 
forced several turnovers while 
also taking advantage of the 
Mounties’ errant passes, al-
lowing the offense to score 
quick points off fast breaks. 
Mount Aloysius was unable 
to keep up with the surg-
ing Tartans, who gradually 
pulled away as the quarter 
progressed. Senior guard Lisa 
Murphy led the offense with 
perfect 6-of-6 shooting and 
a total of 14 ?rst half points. 
Surging with an aggres-
sive ?rst half performance, 
Carnegie Mellon completed 
the ?rst half with the score 
51–33.
The Tartans came out of 
the half with the same con-
sistent play they sustained 
throughout the ?rst half. 
They soon amassed a 21-point 
lead in the beginning of the 
third quarter. The Mounties 
fought back with good de-
fense, but could not slow the 
Tartans down. The Carnegie 
Mellon offense took advan-
tage of offensive rebounds to 
score on second chance shots, 
soon widening the lead to 30 
points. While the Mounties 
struggled with getting to the 
basket and making shots, the 
Tartans found holes and open 
spaces in the Mount Aloysius 
defense. Though they had 
a comfortable lead halfway 
through the third quarter, the 
Tartans refused to get com-
placent and continued to play 
aggressively.
As with the start of the 
previous three quarters, the 
Carnegie Mellon squad got 
to a quick start in the fourth 
quarter. With the team’s large 
lead, many reserves off the 
bench got the opportunity to 
play more minutes than in an 
average game, allowing the 
starters to rest. The quarter 
saw the Mounties ?nally ?nd-
ing some ?ow and momen-
tum in the game, but it was 
already too late in the game 
to start a comeback. Though 
the Mount Aloysius offense 
cut the Carnegie Mellon lead 
by 10 points, the Tartans man-
aged to break 100 points in a 
game for the ?rst time this 
season. The Tartans won the 
game with a score of 108–71.
Murphy ?nished the night 
with a perfect 10-of-10 shoot-
ing performance and 25 
points. Senior Jackie Hude-
pohl led the team with a to-
tal of 26 points on the night. 
Coming off the bench, ?rst-
year Katharine Higgins scored 
19 points for a career-high. 
The Carnegie Mellon team 
completed 60.9 percent of 
?eld goals attempted; of the 
42 baskets made, the team 
recorded 25 assisted. The 
Tartans scored 24 points off 
of turnovers, compared to the 
Mounties’ 16, while also scor-
ing 12 second chance points 
to the Mounties’ 4. With a 
season high of 108 points in 
the game, the Tartans are 
one point away from tying 
the school record for points 
in a game. They broke the 
season’s game-high by a wide 
margin of 28 points. The team 
continued its impressive play 
this season, extending the 
perfect record to 6–0. Next, 
the Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s basketball team will play 
Washington & Jefferson Col-
lege on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016.

While most people were 
doing Thanksgiving activities 
like spending time with their 
families or eating food, The 
Tartan II featured four differ-
ent games in week 12 with 
playoff implications and a 
battle to escape from the cellar 
between Forum Editor Sinead 
Foley’s How does this work? 
and Forum Editor Sinead Fol-
ey’s What is going on?
This week could have up-
ended everything, but it went 
all chalk. The team with the 
better record won every game 
and put the regular season to 
bed one week early.
I needed revenge in this 
matchup. Week three, I put up 
143 points, tied for my fourth 
best game of the year. Unfor-
tunately for me, I was matched 
up against sports editor Alex 
Wood’s team who posted 144. 
I went with Texans wide re-
ceiver Will Fuller V in my ?ex 
spot, thinking he could torch 
the thin Patriots secondary. 
He managed only six points. 
On my bench, Patriots wide re-
ceiver Julian Edelman scored 
eight, Cowboys wide receiver 
Cole Beasley scored 14, and 
Packers wide receiver Jordy 
Nelson put up 28.I righted the 
injustice this week, though. I 
started Washington quarter-
back Kirk Cousins, trusting he 
could do more damage against 
the soft Cowboys defense than 
Falcons quarterback Matt 
Ryan could against the Car-
dinals, and I made the right 
decision. Cousins put up 29 
points, the difference between 
me winning by 43 and me win-
ning by 14, an unacceptably 
small revenge game margin.
If, for some weird reason, 
this league was on television 
and had ?exible scheduling, 
this game would have been 
in prime time. Going into the 
matchup, McManus’s Anus 
held the edge in total points 
scored and a win here would 
have tied these teams’ records 
going into the ?nal week of 
the season. In other words, 
this was essentially a playoff 
game.
Instead, Gutie choked in 
the key moment of her season. 
The decision to play Colts run-
ning back Frank Gore against a 
Steelers team that can defend 
the run but nothing else while 
Raiders wide receiver Michael 
Crabtree had the porous Car-
olina secondary to light up 
would have helped, but it still 
wouldn’t have dragged McMa-
nus’s Anus out of the cellar for 
the week.
Losing yet another week 
of Patriots tight end Rob 
Gronkowski almost certainly 
hurt McManus’s Anus, the 
team is 4–3 with him getting 
meaningful snaps as a receiver 
for a full game and 1–4 with-
out his contributions.
However, fantasy football 
is terrible and sometimes you 
have to work around injuries. 
Gary Barnidge wasn’t the 
answer this week. For their 
part, the Pladdie Daddies 
didn’t exactly do so hot ei-
ther. Broncos wide receiver 
Emmanuel Sanders put up 29 
points, essentially the differ-
ence between the two teams, 
and the squad barely cracked 
100. That’s not a good thing 
to be relying on. That said, the 
Pladdie Daddies took home 
the W and their playoff ticket 
is punched with this ?nal suc-
cess of the season.
This matchup essentially 
locked the Dreamland War-
riors into the three seed come 
playoff time. At 8–4, 200 
points scored and one game 
behind me and 150 points 
and one game ahead of Price’s 
Pladdie Daddies, there’s no 
realistic combination of out-
comes that sees the Dream-
land Warriors swipe the divi-
sion or slip into the second 
wild card.
The Dreamland Warriors 
came to play to snag that three 
seed, though (McManus’s 
Anus, take notes). A score of 
146 would have topped former 
Pillbox Editor Lula Beresford’s 
score any week this season. 
Performances of 25 points or 
more from Saints quarterback 
Drew Brees, Bills running back 
LeSean McCoy, and Giants 
wide receiver Odell Beckham 
turned into a huge week for 
the Dreamland Warriors. With 
the exception of a two-point 
performance from the Dallas 
Cowboys defense, the Mass-
hole Knickerbockers did okay, 
but okay was not going to be 
enough this week. 
What is going on? lit up the 
scoreboard this week to be-
come the ?nal team to snag a 
fourth win this season. What 
is going on scored 41 points 
from the defense and kicker 
spots alone thanks to big days 
from the Giants defense and 
Ravens kicker Justin Tucker. 
The rest of the team showed 
up, too with Dolphins quarter-
back Ryan Tannehil, Cardinals 
running back David Johnson, 
and Panthers running back 
Jonathan Stewart all topping 
20 points.This game was be-
tween two cellar dwellers 
belonging to the same person, 
so it had little in the way of 
implications, but it’s always an 
important milestone when ev-
eryone clears the 10-loss bar. 
What is going on?’s victory 
ensured that no one will ?nish 
with double digit losses head-
ing into next season.
This game could have 
made things interesting. Pill-
box editor Abhishek Tayal’s 
Loquacious Losers have spent 
some stretches this season as a 
point collecting juggernaut. A 
win for the Losers in this game 
would have made Loquacious 
Losers vs. Pladdie Daddies 
in week 13 a de facto playoff 
game with Tayal having an 
outside shot at the division 
crown. Instead, the Rams de-
fense put up eight, and a few 
bad lineup choices ended the 
Losers’ season.
Now that they’re ?rmly out 
of contention, now is the time 
to ask why on earth the adjec-
tive here was loquacious. Are 
losers particularly talkative? 
Did I miss a memo here? It 
seems the obvious choice 
would have been lugubrious, 
or even lackluster. If the point 
was to put a long, alliterative, 
phonetically pleasing phrase, 
why not conjure the human 
response to losing and go with 
lacrimatory or evoke the gro-
tesque and dub your squad the 
limacoid losers. L is basically 
the best adjective letter in the 
dictionary and, honestly, I’m 
glad this game went the way 
it did because this opportunity 
was blown so badly that this 
team deserved nothing good.
Unprecedented levels of 
parity were a big storyline 
in the NFL this year, and the 
same could be said about The 
Tartan II. If every game works 
out correctly, six of the 10 
teams could ?nish with the 
same record. Unfortunately 
for those six teams, it’s the 
other four who will be battling 
it out over winter break for the 
big crown. Online Editor India 
Price’s Pladdie Daddies, assis-
tant Sports Editor Ian Tanaya’s 
Dreamland Warriors, Opera-
tion Manager Jade Crockem’s 
Mr. Rodgers Neighborhood, 
and yours truly have built at 
least two games of separation 
from the ?eld with only one 
game to go.
The ?nal weekend will 
still have drama. If Mr. Rodg-
ers’ Neighborhood outscores 
me by 225 points or I lose my 
last game to Publisher Sarah 
Gutekunst’s McManus’s Anus, 
Crockem can take the top 
seed. Other than that, the reg-
ular season is set in stone and 
this year is in the books.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team took no 
time off after this Thanksgiv-
ing holiday as they jumped 
right back on their home 
court to take on the Saint Vin-
cent College Bearcats in the 
championship game of the 
Carnegie Mellon DoubleTree 
Invitational on Sunday, Nov. 
27. The Tartans took the tro-
phy in a decisive victory with 
a score of 76–62.
The game did not appear 
to be in the Tartans’ favor at 
the outset, though. The team 
made one of seven shots from 
the ?eld and was trailing after 
only four minutes of play, but 
they started to ?nd a rhythm 
as the game progressed. The 
Tartans found themselves on 
a 9–0 scoring run and took 
a huge lead late in the ?rst 
quarter, but the Bearcats 
found a groove of their own 
and managed to bring the 
lead to within seven points. 
The teams continued to scale 
the length of the court and 
trade points, but the Tar-
tans held onto their lead and 
matched their opponents on 
every score. The closing min-
utes of the half were tense as 
Saint Vincent earned eight 
unanswered points and took 
a two-point lead. The Tartans 
quickly squashed the small 
success of their opponents 
with a clean three-pointer 
from senior forward Jack 
Serbin, and coupled with 
some clutch free throw shoot-
ing they headed into the half 
in the lead, 34–33.
The Tartans opened the 
second half with relentless 
offensive pressure, scoring 
on their ?rst four shots of the 
period and eventually tak-
ing a 10 point lead to cap the 
14-5 run. Junior guard Ryan 
Maha was a major contribu-
tor on this run scoring mul-
tiple three-pointers and eight 
of the 14 points. The Tartans 
never relinquished their lead.
The Tartans ?nished the 
game shooting 44.8 percent 
overall from the ?oor, and 
were led by Serbin who scored 
30 points on the night. Maha 
was the only other Tartan to 
score in double digits with 15. 
Senior center Chris Shkil also 
contributed nine points and 
nine rebounds to the Tartan 
victory.
The Tartans then went on 
a short road trip on Wednes-
day to Allegheny College to 
face off against the Gators. 
They continued their success 
from Thanksgiving weekend 
with a 71–58 victory to im-
prove their record to 4–2 on 
the season.
Serbin led the Tartans once 
again in this contest, scoring 
22 points and 14 rebounds. 
Fellow senior Shkil also re-
corded a double-double with 
20 points and 10 rebounds. 
Maha had 13 points of his 
own along with two clutch 
three-point shots in the sec-
ond half to secure the victory 
for the Tartans. Carnegie Mel-
lon will stay on the road as 
they travel to Juniata College 
on Monday, Dec. 5 for a heat-
ed game set to start at 7 p.m.

magic brought to new life
I can’t remember my first encounter with J.K. 
Rowling’s Wizarding World. Somehow, Harry Potter 
has always been a part of my life. I’d read the books 
diligently and I’d watch the first film, Harry Potter 
and the Sorcerer’s Stone, on repeat. I felt an instant 
connection to the Ravenclaw house and knew I 
belonged there even before I was sorted into it. 
Watching the midnight premiere of Harry Potter 
and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 with my cousins in 
the Philippines was a highlight of my teenage years, 
but it was a perfect conclusion to what I saw was 
a perfect franchise. I had said my goodbyes. The 
apparition of a new movie, and then the promise of 
four other films after that as part of a new franchise, 
was at first unsettling and uneasy to me, especially 
since Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was met 
with extreme division.
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is 
directed by David Yates, who directed the last 
four Harry Potter films, and written by J.K. Rowling 
herself. I instantly felt that familiarity as soon as 
the movie started, and the film wasted no time 
welcoming folks into the Wizarding World. The 
comfort in this felt like a fuzzy blanket, the Easter 
eggs (which were mostly name drops) in the film felt 
like tasty chocolate, and pretty soon I was charmed 
by the adventures of the American Wizarding 
World, Newt Scamander, and his case full of 
magical creatures.
While this movie is certain to please many Harry 
Potter fans, Eddie Redmayne’s performance as 
Newt Scamander is one of the shining reasons 
to see this movie. Redmayne’s eccentric English 
magizoologist is layered, complex, and shows 
immense potential for his character, which was 
incredibly exciting. The roots he establishes for 
Scamander’s character and eccentricity are relatable 
and striking, and his performance goes above 
and beyond to a level just as worthy as his Oscar-
winning performance as Stephen Hawking in The 
Theory of Everything.
Unfortunately, most of the American characters 
and aspects introduced felt flat, unlikable, or 
disappointing for stretches of the movie. No-Maj (or 
Muggle) Jacob Kowalski’s presence initially didn’t 
make sense on paper and it reverberated for half 
of the film’s first act. Tina Goldstein came across as 
extremely uptight and the film seemed to clench up 
at points. So much of the Magical Congress of the 
United States of America, the American version of 
the Ministry of Magic, felt unexplored and the film 
felt like it had so much more potential to explore 
certain themes. In addition, the ending took a weird 
transition that felt unnatural and a bit forced.
However, it also made me excited for what’s 
to come. Fantastic Beasts reignited my love 
for the Wizarding World and was an amazing 
reintroduction of magic into my life. 
Every spell cast took me back to my childhood and 
the love and care of this franchise could still be felt 
through every frame. Not only did the film reaffirm 
that “Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you 
home,” but it enchanted you to spread the magic 
for others to enjoy and cherish.
Izzy Sio | StaffwriterMoana
Disney outdoes itself again
Who are you? That is the central question that 
Disney’s new animated film, Moana, asks. 
It’s very easy to get swept away by Disney’s 
Moana. It’s also very easy to get swept into 
a formulaic Disney film that’s been told over 
and over again. And it’s also very easy to lose 
sight of that message. 
Moana, however, takes that order into 
new directions to tell an incredibly fun and 
insightful story that rings true to the heart 
of Disney, resonates with its audience, and 
strikes at the heart of one searching for their 
identity. Directed by the team behind The Little 
Mermaid, John Musker and Ron Clements, 
Moana tells the story of the titular character’s 
journey to save her home by travelling across 
the sea to meet the demigod Maui and restore 
order to her world. 
Every moment of this movie felt like a thrilling 
and exciting adventure, and the animation 
that helped to create and shape this movie 
only enriches the experience. The animation 
is absolutely mesmerizing and breathtaking 
— each blue sea made you want to glide your 
hand through it, and the water’s movements 
are a marvel of animation that can’t be 
described in words. These landscapes and 
animations are built for the big screen. I also 
watched the film in 3D, and while 3D usually 
doesn’t work for me, this movie is the rare 
exception, being made to be enjoyed in all 
three dimensions.
Besides being well-written, the characters 
of Moana are also incredibly impactful. The 
titular character, Moana, is an extraordinary, 
admirable woman who feels organic and 
real, and throughout the movie she constantly 
surprised me and made me smile. In addition, 
the movie was often surprisingly meta, with 
demiguy Maui utilizing his arrogance to 
comment on Disney’s typicality when he 
wasn’t stealing the show with his infectious 
personality. Tamatoa, a huge crab, comments 
on his fondness for breaking into song and his 
quips were as dazzling as he was. 
The music of Moana is written by Opetaia 
Foa’i, Mark Mancina, and Hamilton creator 
Lin-Manuel Miranda. While Miranda’s 
signature feel, style, and vibe are all over 
Moana’s music, there is a distinct theme that 
stands out on its own. All the tunes are destined 
to become instant classics, and fit perfectly 
within the world of Moana. 
Miranda even lends his voice to some of the 
tracks, particularly a jazzy, upbeat cover of 
“You’re Welcome” featuring Grease! Live star 
Jordan Fisher, which make them as equally 
amazing as Hamilton and this movie. Moana 
is groundbreaking for everything it stands for. 
It opens audiences up to the rich culture of 
Polynesia, delivers a journey and lesson of 
self-discovery in a powerful way, showcases 
a future classic collection of Disney songs, 
becomes a self-aware Disney film for the first 
time, and features a powerful heroine that is an 
inspiration to all in her demeanor and how she 
leads her people. This instant classic holds its 
place with the other great films before it, and 
is an incredible journey that teaches people to 
help find who they truly are.

A girl’s been haunting
the grimy bathroom mirrors
of every
 restaurant,
 bar, and
 gas station
I stumble into.
 ~
Just a child,
she appears
on the kind of nights I throw
my shoes out after,
the soles completely saturated with
 vomit,
 mud, or
 blood
from blisters born and broken on romps
across miles of rambling concrete.
Nights of skin to touch
and pills to pop
and moons to howl down
  to the horizon,
   arms flung wide 
   to encompass
   the city’s buzzing 
   electric dome.
The kind of nights that will have to be
Age 8, 18
 phantom smiles of memory,
and sure as hell not stories
you tell the kids.
~
Her gaze catches me
in places she has no business being,
a child up after bedtime with
soap scum streaked cheeks
and timid, hungry questions
in her familiar eyes.
They’re my eyes,
 and the eyes of my sister,
 and our mother before us.
Eyes colored empty bottle green
and lonely.
The kind of lonely that kills
tomato plants,
left to shrivel on the windowsill
with no one to house sit,
or lives off ramen
        with no one worthwhile
        to cook for,
or leaves you haunting bathroom mirrors,
craving a life with
 better things to do.

In the cramped claustrophobia
of a bathroom stall, her silence jumbles
 with the chorus of chipped graffiti,
asks me, did we make it out?
There are no answers for her
when I’m alone.
But in the next room
there’s a rush of sound
ready to scoop me up
in the exhilaration
 of exclusion,
fold me back into the pack
with our tiny passwords,
 quick hand squeezes,
 cackling laughter
 and secrets kissed
 into each other’s ears
  like prayers.
Public codes
and private rituals.
Tangling hair with dye,
painting each other
a hundred hues,
our choices coating
our roots,
 growing away
 from the children
 in the mirror.
Scents cloaking us
with an idea
of luxury.
We consume,
morphing I to we, 
build dialects that stain
our every breath
with our new origin.
~
Beyond her,
there’s a night waiting,
 heavy as a beer bottle
  as I shift my grip,
  ready to brain the next fucker
  who catcalls
  one of my girls,
light as dancing on bridge railings,
 our toes protruding
 into tenuous space,
 Laughing,
 mind the gap.

Editor’s Note: The Tartan’s Visual Editor, Theodore 
Teichman, is a member of the Exploded Ensemble.
The last time I ventured into the Alumni Concert Hall 
was for a senior recital. The brightly lit room was regal 
with decorative pillars standing tall at the head of 
the room, and red panels lining the walls. This past 
Wednesday night, the room was dark, with lights 
being focused ahead of where the chairs had been 
arranged for the audience to sit. The front rows were 
filled instantly, and before long people had to resort 
to skirting the edges of the seating area to catch 
a glimpse of what was to be a truly unique musical 
experience.
The Exploded Concert was performed by Carnegie 
Mellon’s Exploded Ensemble, with pieces put together 
by students. Each of the pieces took inspiration from 
selected source material, and as the co-director of the 
show, Lance LaDuke, put it, was designed to “blow it 
up, or explode it, if you will.” The results were thought-
provoking and performed with a combination of 
electronic music and acoustic instrumentation.
The aim of assembling the ensemble was to give 
students in the School of Music some experience with 
more contemporary forms of music composition and 
performance. “Today, music is moving at an entirely 
different pace,” LaDuke explained, which is why it 
benefits students to have exposure to as many genres 
as possible. This was the first performance by the 
ensemble in concert, but far from being their last. 
“We’ve been experimenting around campus quite a bit, 
and we’ll be performing later on in the year,” LaDuke 
promised.
Amongst the pieces was a video that had been 
conceptualized by the late Pauline Oliveros. Oliveros 
was an absolute staple in the early years of the 
constantly evolving field of electronic music, and was 
known for creating experimental musical environments, 
and liked to work with natural sounds. The video 
projected in three panes, separated by the pillars of 
the hall, and showed the members of the ensemble 
playing their instruments and marching around 
the periphery of a racquetball court. The camera 
continuously rotated, capturing all angles of the court, 
while a powerful microphone, seen as a gray fuzzy 
object facing one of the walls of the court, captured 
sound from 360º. The audio resembled that of an 
orchestra tuning their instruments, but with the echoes 
that resulted from the enclosed setting of the court,

Concert!

the sounds melted into what 
I can only describe as an 
interlaced cacophony, that 
simmered down to a 
hush by the end of the 
video.
The other 
performances of the 
night encompassed 
the spirit of marrying 
the electronic and the 
acoustic. Each piece 
was complemented 
with projections ranging 
from thick streaks of colors 
melting into one another to a 
stopwatch that counted to nothing 
fast, and then slower as the 
performance went on. 
“Time Lapse,” by Theodore 
Teichman, included a graphic music 
display overlaying a live video feed 
of sophomore Steven MacDonald 
walking around the College of Fine 
Arts building while playing the 
bagpipes.
Senior Shoshana Klein also 
arranged an incredible rendition 
of Bjork’s “Crystalline,” entitled 
“Crystallinesque,” which 
incorporated the 
use of members of 
the ensemble using 
bottles and blocks as 
percussion instruments. 
The various materials of 
the percussion instruments 
creating a ringing atmosphere 
of tinks, clanks, and bangs that 
filled the entire hall, as members 
walked through the aisles and 
around the back of the hall.
The evening ended with a stunning 
tribute to David Bowie, arranged and 
conducted by fifth year senior Erik 
Fredriksen, titled “Warszawa.” The 
tribute included the entire ensemble 
including electronic, acoustic and 
vocal counterparts. The deep and 
raspy voices of Jake Chirulla and 
Tyler Harper brought vibrance to an 
eclectic and interpretive orchestra, 
finishing the event on a moving 
note.
Since the ensemble has vowed to 
take the stage again, I encourage all 
lovers of experimentation to keep an 
eye out for announcements, and, in 
the words of LaDuke, “if you see us 
wandering around campus, join us.”

PHIPPS
Winter Flower Show
Photos by Rosemary Haynes | Staff Photographer

The holiday spirit is becoming more and more prevalent in Pittsburgh each day. From the decorated 
houses to the festive lights illuminating downtown, all of Pittsburgh is getting ready for this joyous season. 
However, the Pittsburgh holiday display that I’ve found to be the most unique is the Winter Flower Show 
at Phipps Conservatory.
When I went to this event, it was also 
my first time ever visiting Phipps; there 
were no expectations, only excitement. 
As my friends and I walked towards the 
entrance, the first things we saw were 
two large Christmas trees covered in col-
orful lights. There’s nothing like two beau-
tifully decorated Christmas trees to easily 
get visitors in the holiday spirit.
Once we were inside, we quickly bought 
our tickets and headed towards the first 
room of the exhibit, which was the Palm 
Court. This slightly humid room was filled 
with palm trees, and it made for a 
somewhat Floridian experience. 
My friends and I kept walking to find that the 
holiday show actually began in the next room: 
mini Christmas trees, penguin sculptures, and 
beautiful red ribbons were all displayed, and you 
could feel that happiness of the holiday season. 
Poinsettia flowers were also dispersed 
throughout, already being the true stars of the 
show.
The exhibit pathway led my friends and me to a human-sized reindeer statue ice skating around a 
gigantic Christmas tree, which was decorated with lights, red ornaments, and white ribbons. Right next to 
this was a snowman display, surrounded by flowers of all different colors. The sight of wintery snowmen 
being surrounded by spring flowers was definitely something you don’t see too often.
My friends and I continued to pass by more festive displays, with flowering plants such as Winterberry 
and Blue Holly making more frequent appearances. It wasn’t until we went outside to see the light show, 
that we really started to feel that holiday excitement. Seeing all the bright and bold colors with the 
unique lighting patterns reminded me of watching holiday light shows with my family, as a kid. 
At Phipps, there were giant lights shaped as ornaments and tree lights, as well as moving lights 
emulating dangling ice crystals. Even though it the temperature was very cold outside, the mesmerizing 
lights display along with the decorated outdoor garden made up for it. If you have the time, be sure to 
check out the light show at Phipps. It’ll definitely help you relax before finals, and even get you in the 
holiday spirit!

The division of the country’s conscience, done publicly and 
grotesquely, leaves us going home to loved ones who 
may feel philosophically or emotionally threatened 
by us or each other. Confusion over misunderstood 
ideals, a seemingly deining choice creating an 
ocean between siblings, parents, cousins. 
This year has presented rare dificulties in 
family relations, each side heartbroken and 
angry. And beyond the family, we might feel 
an unbridgeable gap in sentiment between us 
and the more nebulous “other,” those we do 
not know who do not agree with us. In this 
case, it’s even harder to believe there could 
be any common ground to stand on.
But, if Arrival is telling us anything, it’s that 
there is always common ground. The virtue 
of the ilm’s main character is that she is 
willing to put in the enormous effort it takes 
to listen, to take the time for intelligent 
consideration and deep understanding, 
which too often people mistake for being 
frivolous or unrealistic. 
So maybe we should talk about this on 
an even larger scale, consider what the 
“other” is to a whole lot of people, maybe 
even a country. As mentioned earlier, this 
movie does bring to mind thoughts of 
Syrian refugees, or others forced into exile, 
looking for inclusion from a foreign power. 
Consequently, I think about the reductive 
way that certain administrations have 
addressed and labelled these people. 
It seems that organizations of powerful 
people around the world have decided that 
what refugees or other marginalized groups 
communicate is death, and, in their fervor 
to squash a perceived threat, lead many 
more people to cataclysm. Arrival intends to 
land the point that this merely boils down to 
misunderstanding.
The only villains in Arrival are not people, 
but rather misguided principles, reactionary 
protectiveness, and defensiveness, which so 
quickly turns to violent offensiveness.
So, yes, in my mind Arrival is a truly perfect 
movie for the holiday season in this strange year. 
It stands hopeful in the face of so much news that 
would undercut its sentiment. I’ll be sure to see it 
again, with my family, in a theater, surrounded by 
strangers with whom I’ll be able to name at least one 
commonality.

Communication and the new movie Arrival
Arrival, a new movie directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by 
Eric Heisserer, is based on the short story “Story of Your Life” by 
Ted Chiang. It stars Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, and Forest 
Whitaker.
I want to talk about how Arrival is an antidote to the 
lashy/skin-deep/overblown summer blockbuster, but it 
would be disingenuous to say that this ilm isn’t aiming 
even higher. This is a movie that wants you to leave 
the theater talking about subjects ranging from 
the Syrian refugee crisis to Noam Chomsky to the 
fundamentals of human empathy. 
I’ll try not to reveal too much, but just trust that this 
is a bit more of a mind meal than Independence 
Day.
First of all, this movie is directed with an 
explicit interest in showing you images that 
will linger in your mind long after the credits 
roll. I’m fairly certain an imperative goal 
of the cinematographer, Bradford Young, 
was to make audience members dream 
vividly of the enormous egg-like alien 
crafts hovering precariously over us, or 
the austere rectangular cavity wherein 
most of the ilm’s action takes place. 
The images are composed quietly and 
monumentally, with no (well, maybe a 
few) explosions or sugary excitement 
to confuse the experience. Even the 
chosen structure of the ilm, edited 
consciously and curiously, took me 
along in a way that was very unlike other 
movies, particularly in the sci-i genre. 
It’s not just the content of the story 
that’s meant to communicate with you, 
but the idiosyncratically cerebral way 
that it is told. This makes for a brilliant 
compliment to the story itself.
There is reason to believe that Arrival 
was written at a more politically and 
socially hopeful time, with its gaze cast 
on the hurdles, challenges, and ultimate 
saving graces of our increasingly globalized 
society. Perhaps the writer assumed that 
the ideals which Arrival stands for would be 
nearly universally recognized and embraced, 
making the ilm itself a victory lag mounted atop 
our progressive social landscape. However, recent 
developments in nationalist rhetoric, the cooling of 
international relationships, and the souring of attitudes 
toward a cohesive global community force Arrival onto 
a different platform; it is an allegory, a voice trying to pull 
us away from the void of reductive thinking, crying out for 
actualized dialogue and intricately imagined communication.
