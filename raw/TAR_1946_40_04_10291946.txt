Carnegie Tech Station WCIT 
Starts Campus Broadcasts
Carnegie Tech will be on the 
air beginning Thursday, October 
31 at 12:45, if everything pro­
ceeds according to plans. At that 
time, the first of a series of test 
broadcasts will inaugurate WCIT, 
a radio station run by and for the 
students of this college. Op­
erated through the institution's 
network of powerlines from the 
studio in the Fine Arts build­
ing it can be received at 900 
on the dial of any radio receiver 
in the buildings on campus, with 
the exception of the FPHA bar­
racks and the fraternity houses.
A group of students from all 
the schools, under the direction 
of Professor George B. Kimberley 
of the Drama Department, has 
been working on this project ever 
since the construction of the nec­
essary equipment by the CIT Ra­
dio Club, which received the 
guidance of the Department of 
Electrical Engineering in this 
task. For a preliminary period 
of about one week, the organizers 
of this project are planning to 
hold two half-hour tests daily, 
one from 12:45 to 1:15, and the 
other from 7:00 to 7:30 p. m. The 
noon program will consist of pop­
ular recordings, while light music, 
such as Gilbert and Sullivan, 
musical comedies, and semi-class­
ical works, will fill the evening 
broadcast.
If reception is good and the 
audience reaction favorable, a call 
for interested students from all 
schools will be made in order to 
expand the organization into a 
regular broadcasting station. The 
time and place of an organization­
al meeting will be announced at 
that time. Preliminary plans in­
clude four to five hours of daily 
broadcasting, with short programs 
in the morning and at noon, and 
several hours on the air in the 
evening. Aside from popular and 
classical music, the tentative 
schedule calls for newcasts, skits, 
variety programs, sports cover 
age, and guest speakers. The ex 
tent of its activities will be de­
termined mostly by the amount of 
interest shown by the student 
body.
The technical side of the pro­
posed studio has thus far been 
handled entirely by the CIT Ra­
dio Club, an organization which 
has been active on the campus for 
several years. Under the super­
vision of Mr. E. M. Williams of 
the Electrical Engineering depart­
ment, two of the club’s members, 
Frank Pake and Jim Woodford, 
constructed a transmitter which 
the school has donated for stu­
dent broadcasting. The apparatus 
operates on the “wired-wireless” 
principle, using Carnegie Tech’s 
powerlines as an antenna. By 
keeping the power low, radiation 
is at a minimum and the sta­
tion will not require a license 
from the FCC. For the same rea­
son, however, reception of WCIT’s
programs is at present limited to 
these buildings on the campus 
taking their power directly from 
the school’s lines. This does not 
include the FPHA barracks and 
the fraternity houses. But, if the 
necessary equipment and license 
can be obtained, a subsidiary 
transmitter is planned to extend 
the station’s range to those build­
ings.
By going on the air on Thurs­
day at 12:45 p. m., Carnegie' Tech 
will join several dozen other col­
leges in a network started by 
Brown University about ten years 
ago. On the other campuses the 
radio station has become one of 
the foremost student activities, 
and the organizers of the station 
here hope that WCIT will attain 
the same distinction.
“Red Feather” 
Asks Donation
Carnegie Tech was alloted a 
quota of $4600 as its share of the 
1946 Community Chest campaign 
to raise $4,651,857 in Pittsburgh 
and Allegheny County.
Ten minutes of scheduled class 
periods will be devoted to solici­
tation during the campaign, but 
those absent or otherwise not so­
licited will be able to make their 
pledges at the cashier’s office. A 
deferred payment plan is offered, 
and subsequent payments can be 
made at the cashier’s office.
Director of the campus cam­
paign is Professor Kent D. Shaf­
fer. “With college students as­
suming ah ever increasing share 
of the responsibilities of citizen­

John Coventry Smith Speaks 
- At Year’s First Chapel Service
Next Tuesday, November 5, at 
11:30, the first Chapel service of 
the semester will be held in the 
Little Theater. The YMCA, which 
is sponsoring the service, will 
present as guest speaker Rev. 
John Coventry Smith.
Rec. Smith has been a speaker 
at many student meetings in the 
past, including Chapel, YMCA and 
CWCA meetings, and Religious 
Discussion week prosrams.
He was born in Stamford, Can­
ada, of American parents, grew 
up in a United Presbyterian par­
sonage in Pennsylvania, and grad­
uated from Muskingum College 
and the Pittsburgh-Xenia Theo­
logical Seminary. Since his return 
from Japan, where he was a mis­
sionary for thirteen years, he re­
ceived his Master’s degree from 
Hartford Seminary and the Doctor 
of Divinity from Muskingum.

Publicity Bureau Announces Head
Stanley R. March has succeeded 
Max E. Hannum as supervisor of 
Carnegie Tech’s publications and 
news releases. Mr. March is di­
rector of the newly organized De­
partment of Public Relations, 
which embraces all of the duties 
formerly performed by Hannum’s 
Bureau of News and Publications 
in addition to a general public re­
lations program.
Other personnel in the new Pub­
lic Relations office include R. E. 
Porteus as editor of the Carnegie 
Tech News Service; Mrs. Betty 
Morrison, editor of publications; 
Mrs. L. S. Talbert, production 
manager for publications; Miss 
Eleanor Tallmadge, publicity as­
sistant: and Dale Stull, part-time
assistant in sports publicity.
Mr. Hannum, for sixteen years 
a popular figure on the campus 
and one of the best known per­
sonalities in sports circle in the 
tri-state area, resigned at Tech 
to accept the position of Assistant 
to the President at Franklin and 
Marshall College, Lancaster, Pa.
Max Hannum came to Carnegie 
Tech in 1930 from the sports staff 
of the Pittsburgh Press to head 
athletic publicity. Asked to coach 
basketball in a temporary capacity 
in 1932, he remained as coach 
until the beginning of this year. 
Under his guidance the Tartan 
fives scored numerous triumphs, 
winning two Eastern champion­
ships. Mr. Hannum resigned his
athletic duties early this year to 
devote all his time to the Car­
negie Tech Bureau of News and 
Publications, to which he had been 
appointed as manager in 1941.
Director March, new head of 
public relations, is an alumnus of 
Rutgers University. He has had 
experience in the Alumni and 
Public Relations Department of 
Rutgers and with public relations 
organizations in New York. Mr. 
March was the director in charge 
of the recent George Westinghouse 
Centennial conducted by Westing­
house Electric Corporation, which 
culminated in the Science and En­
gineering Forum held in Pitts­
burgh last May.
The first homecoming of CIT 
alumni since 1943 which will be 
held this Friday, Saturday, and 
Sunday, is expected to be the larg­
est in the school’s history. Only a 
continuation of the hotel strike 
could keep many of the expected 
visitors away. Anticipating that
Tecvets Plan 
Policy Meeting
The organization of Carnegie 
Tech veterans, Tecvets, is meeting 
at 4:30 this Thursday to plan for 
the coming year and to discuss 
changes of policy. They will con­
vene in room 104, Industries hall.
Their president, Harry Thor, is 
promoting a policy emphasizing 
citizenship and veteran’s problems 
instead of social activities. He has 
stated that Tecvets does not in­
tend to act in fraternity spheres.
In announcing this meeting 
president Thor expressed his sin­
cere hopes that Tecvets would as­
sume some “character” this year 
and assert some influence in cam­
pus, local, and national affairs. 
To achieve this end* a large at­
tendance at the first meeting is 
desired by the officers.
Tecvets was organized at Car­
negie in the fall of 1944 by Aubrey 
Caplan, who graduated the next 
year from the department of elec­
trical engineering. The organiza-

Dressier Speaks 
At IRC Meeting
C. W. Dressier, associate editor 
of the Post-Gazette will speak at 
an open meeting of the Interna­
tional Relations Club on Wednes­
day. Oct. 30, at 4:30 in room 114 
MMCC. His speech will be on 
the issues of the coming election.
Mr. Dressier has twenty-five 
years of newspaper work and fif­
teen years in politics behind him. 
He believes his speech will be of 
special interest to veterans, espe­
cially those who are eligible to 
vote for the first time.
The I.R.C., which is bringing 
him to Tech, is an affiliate of the 
Carnegie Endowment for Interna­
tional Peace. Its sponser on cam­
pus is Mrs. M. K. Chapman.
The following week on Nov. 7, 
Colgate Prentiss, President of the 
Student Federalists, will speak on 
promoting world democracy. Mr. 
Prentiss, a college student himself, 
is president of this organization 
which is represented in high 
schools and colleges all over the 
country, and whose purpose is to 
promote world democracy.
Any student who is interested in 
discussing world problems is in­
vited to attend these meetings and 
become a member of the club. The 
Carnegie Endowment to which it 
belongs sends books to the club 
concerning current affairs as well 
as a fortnightly news summary. 
The books are kept in the MMCC 
library. They also sponsor a na­
tional regional conference, which 
will be held at Vassar this year, 
to which Carnegie Tech will send 
two members.
Notice
There are approximately 
45 rooms for single students 
still available within 20 min­
utes travel time from the
C. I. T. campus. The Admin­
istration is especially inter­
ested in making these rooms 
available to men paying rents 
in excess of $7.50 per week. 
Apply at the FPHA Office, 
Unit C, if interested.
the strike will be over before Fri­
day night, the school is keeping 
seventy hotel rooms reserved for 
the visitors.
The Class of ’21 plans to cele­
brate this, its twenty-fifth home­
coming, with the largest repre­
sentation. In an unveiling ceremo­
ny attended by the Carnegie fac­
ulty and trustees Saturday morn­
ing, this class will present the In­
stitute with a portrait of Pro­
fessor Emeritus W. C. L. Trinks, 
former head of the Mechanical 
Engineering Department. The por­
trait was painted for the Class 
of ’21 by Malcolm Purcell.
An impressive feature of this 
homecoming will be a memorial 
service in the Carnegie Music Hall 
Sunday afternoon. The ceremony 
will honor the 123 Tech students 
who died in service. President 
Doherty will deliver the address.
Special invitations to the Me­
morial have been sent to the par­
ents and wives of those CIT alum-

to the Spring Carnival committee.
Dorm Students 
Elect Officers
Elections took place in all the 
men’s dormitories on Monday, 
October 21. The residents of each 
dormitory elected a president, 
vice-president, and secretary to 
conduct their meetings as well as 
one member from each class — 
freshman, sophomore, junior and 
senior—to represent them on the 
dormitory council. The freshman 
representatives will not have a 
vote on issues before the coun­
cil until their second semester, 
but in addition to the other three 
representatives, the president of 
each dormitory will be entitled to 
vote.
Electioneering in many of the 
dorms was enlivened with cam­
paign promises, lists of qualifica­
tions, and even some very effec­
tive cartoons appearing daily on 
the bulletin boards.
The achievements of the dorm 
intramural team are but a pre­
view of what the dorm men hope 
to be showing of their real 
strength and importance. Prelim­
inary plans for this semester in­
clude a new and better dorm pa­
per, The Dorm Bagpiper, and a 
party or dance for the dorm men 
later this year.
The men elected to offices in 
each of the dormitories were as

R.I.P.
Probably the announcement in last week’s Tartan that 
Freshmen Regulations were about to end caught many students 
completely by surprise. Many others, who were not startled or 
amazed, were probably highly amused.
And no one can blame them, for half the student body 
was under the impression that Frosh Regulations had been 
dropped due to the high percentage of veterans in the freshmen 
class or that they had been postponed indefinitely due to the 
power strike.
These deductions were not unfounded. Freshmen pushed 
their way through upperclassmen, returned friendly ‘‘hellos” 
with haughty stares, and in general broke regulations right and 
left without batting an eyelash. Confused upperclassmen had no 
way to enforce regulations even if they had wanted :to do so. 
There were no cards on which to turn in offenders’ names; there 
was no stunt night with which to threaten erring frosh. Only an 
enlightened few knew who was responsible for the regulatiods, 
the termination of which comes as either a surprise or a joke. 
Students are apt to quip “What regulations?”
Under these conditions it would be far better to have elim­
inated them altogether, for regulations which provoke jeers and 
disrespect are undermining the very purposes for which they 
were formed.
Many feel that these rules and the enforcement of them are 
a vital part of establishing school unity and school spirit. This 
year, however, when regulations should have set the key for 
the future, they fizzled completely into a haphazard, lackadaisical 
muddle which impressed no one and certainly contributed noth­
ing to school spirit and school unity.
On Saturday, when freshmen tossed aside their dinks and 
name plates, few of them had occasion to feel any pridfe in this 
privilege or any thrill in becoming an integral part of Carnegie 
Tech. The termination of freshman regulations no longer is a 
big event to be celebrated by plebes and upperclassmen alike; 
today it’s one big joke.
Better Than Park Benches
Carnegie Tech, like every other college in the country, was 
faced this fall with growing pains, the most acute of which was 
the housing shortage. With the inroads of a student population 
numbering three thousand, the housing facilities available were 
miserably inadequate.
This situation was mitigated by the erection of temporary 
housing under FPHA and by a publicity campaign for off campus 
rooms.
As we have stated before, every Tech student has been pro­
vided with a place to live.
Actually CIT is top rank among the colleges in its rapid 
and thorough solution of the housing shortage.
In many schools the students are still living in dorm-con­
verted gymnasiums, chapels, and assembly halls. The FPHA
barracks here, although still lacking in many conveniences, 
were at least available for occupancy at the beginning of the 
fall term.
In spite of these advantages, however, the FPHA barracks
have developed into a sore spot. Reports of almost barbaric
living conditions have been circulating on campus. Poor heat-

Give It A Try
Next Tuesday at the regular assembly hour, the first chapel 
of the year will be held. When these services were first inno­
vated on campus, they presented an interesting variety of pro­
grams which attracted a large attendance. This was the one 
occasion in which students could participate as a body.
Times have changed, however. The assembly hour is really

At the second meeting of Stu-

the following petitions were ap­
proved:
Delta Gamma to hold a Pledge 
Dance on November 9.
Kappa Alpha Theta to hold tea 
dances on October 24, November 7,
14, and 21, and a spring formal 
on March 22.
Margaret Morrison Senate to

October 29.
The Pi Kappa Alpha’s to hold 
an afternoon dance for 1946 class 
of sorority pledges on October 17.
Sigma Nu’s to hold a tea dance 
on October 18, and a party on 
October 26.
The Citcom Clan to hold a party 
on October 25.
The SAE’s to hold a closed 
dance on December 7. Invitations 
will be issued according to a plan 
yet to be developed.
The American Institute of Elec­
trical Engineers to hold a closed 
Christmas dance on December 20.
The following budgets were ap­
proved: CWCA, Cwens, Handbook, 
M. M. Senate, Mortar Board, Bag­
piper, Women’s Glee Club, and 
the Chapel Choir.
The motions made at the pre­
vious meeting were approved. This 
was necessary because a quorum 
was not present at that meeting.
Mr. James Boyce made a report 
on Scotch and Soda.
The following amendment was 
proposed to Article II Section I 
of the Student Council Constitu­
tion: ,
The Council shall be composed 
as follows:
(a) Each College (College of 
Engineering, College of Fine 
Arts, and Margaret Morri­
son Carnegie College) shall 
have one voting member on 
Council for every one hun­
dred-fifty (150) (or major 
fraction thereof) full-time, 
under-graduate students en­
rolled in that college, as 
shown by the Registrar’s 
official lists for the semes­
ter in which general elec­
tions are held.
The suggestion was made that 
Council do something about ac­
quiring new songs for Tech.* * *
The third meeting of student 
Council was held on October 23.
Miss Hallas requested that all 
money and tickets still out for the 
Dance last Saturday be handed in 
immediately. It was then moved 
that Kappa Alpha Theta be per­
mitted to hold their tea dances in 
Thistle Hall instead of the Union 
on November 14 and ?1
A word which has been loom­
ing larger and larger on the na­
tional horizon is “security.” Slick 
paper magazines send their star 
reporters to find out if college 
students want security, if six-toed 
ballet dancers want security. In 
Congress, too, no discussion of the 
full employment bill or of the 
idea of a guaranteed annual 
wage is complete unless “secur­
ity” has been bandied about. Us­
ually the question is posed in 
this form: As a job seeker would 
you rather receive a low wage 
and be secure in your job (as 
Civil Service Employees are), or 
face the rigors of competitive 
employment and collect its re­
wards, if you get them?
The Misuse of Security 
Normally, every person is ex­
pected to answer this question for 
himself, according to his tempera­
ment and philosophy of life. But 
recently there has been a concert­
ed campaign to sell the public 
on “the blessings of insecurity.” 
The impression has been bruited 
about that security seekers are 
scaredy-cats who want to loaf. 
Now far be it from me to crit­
icize any move aimed at raising 
the level of public morals, eco­
nomic or otherwise: cynic that I 
am, however, I cannot help but
Council
Student Council is going to re­
place two Glee Club keys that 
were lost last summer in the 
mails.
Margaret Morrison Senate will 
be permitted to hold Freshmen 
elections and the tie for Senior 
Class President on Tuesday, Octo­
ber 29. They may also hold the 
Color Day Assembly at 12:30 and 
the Color Day Tea at 4:30 of the 
same day.
It was moved that the proposed 
amendment be accepted by Coun­
cil and presented to the student 
body on October 29, at an all­
school Assembly in the Little 
Theater.
The Scotch and Soda contest 
will be extended two weeks. Also 
it was moved that the $200 which 
Student Council had voted to give 
to Scotch and Soda will be held 
back until such time as that or­
ganization is reactivated and the 
contest is ended.

suspect that this is a political 
dodge to defeat the full employ­
ment bill and measures like it. It 
seems to me that a full employ­
ment bill should stand or fall on 
its economic feasibility alone. 
Praise of Financial Insecurity 
There are those who believe 
that people will grow fat and idle 
unless there is a “surplus of la­
bor” waiting to take away their 
jobs. It seems, according to this 
opinion, that it is worthwhile to 
have a few millions of unemploy­
ed so that most of us will be 
“tough and hardy.” These people 
can cite numerous illustrations to 
show that down through the ages 
man has progressed in proportion 
to his struggles. Man, the an­
imal, knows only the law of tooth 
and fang. Therefore, they say, 
since policemen won’t let us pull 
knives on each other in the street, 
let’s do the next best thing—cre­
ate a maximum of financial in­
security.
Only a Half Wit
In this light such an idea ap-? 
pears slightly ridiculous, but there 
is considerable truth to it. We 
realize that people are spurred 
on by necessity, that Edison would 
have been a “punk” inventor if 
he had been born with a silver 
spoon in his mouth. Yet the truth 
is that excessive poverty retards 
progress too. Look at India today. 
Remember that the great world 
civilizations originated in lands 
rich in natural resources, where 
existence was easy, like Egypt 
and the Middle East. Here, where 
people had a reasonable amount 
of leisure after providing for their 
subsistence, they were able to 
plan and invent. This, I think, is 
the key to the whole situation. 
Need For Minimum of Security 
Certainly people need insecur­
ity to prevent them from degen­
erating and to spur them to new 
achievements. But they also need 
a certain minimum of security to 
give them the leisure to feel in­
secure. A man needs the insecur­
ity of knowing that the job won’t 
be done unless he does it, but he 
needs the security of knowing 
that he can get a suitable job if 
he’s willing to work. So, from a 
moral point of view, if not from 
an economic one, it seems to me 
that the idea of a full employ­
ment bill will hold water.
Having had the experience of a 
great depression, let us put no 
credence in a theory which says 
it is all right for a few million 
people to be unemployed.

Regarding End Man
22 October 1946
Dear Sir:
Last week while riding the bus 
to the University of Pittsburgh I 
found a copy of the “Carnegie 
Tartan” lying quite publically on 
the seat beside me. It was all alone 
in that big bus so I picked it up 
and read it. I don’t think it mind­
ed. I do hope you don’t either be­
cause I liked what I read. Be­
sides, I got to class fifteen min­
utes late.
Being socially minded I know 
that I have been presumptuous in 
thinking that you may also like 
to know what I liked about it. I 
refer to an article titled “End 
Man on the Senior Fence” written 
by Casey Stine, quite obviously a 
“Front Man on the Literary 
Fence.” To find an article of such 
enjoyment in a college paper (ex­
cluding the Pitt News, of course) 
is a pleasant surprise. The wit, 
the flow of words, the clarity, and 
the effect are all synonomous. And, 
frankly, my summer vacation 
seems less like the bore it was 
after reading about Mr. Stine’s 
bout with reality over a type­
writer.
Anyway, I just thought you’d 
like to know, and, just in case 
Mr. Stine might like to know, 
could you tell him for me? Tell 
him I liked his article, tell him I 
wish I could write as well (and 
me an English major, too) and tell 
him I wish he went to Pitt.

ever that it takes all types of peo­
ple to make a world. I refer, of 
course, to that stupid, inaccurate 
and decidedly childish letter on 
Casey Stein you had the poor 
judgment to publish in the Tartan. 
All editors get letters of that type 
from time to time, but they usu­
ally are decerning enough to file 
them in the waste basket with the 
other nasty unconstructive criti­
cism. The only thing accomplished 
by that letter was the defamation 
of Casey’s character as well as 
your own and the school’s.
For the information of the let­
ter’s author and his thirty-five co­
signing henchmen, let me say 
that I, for one, happen to enjoy 
reading End Man On The Senior 
Fence. It is understood that 
Casey’s column has its ups and 
downs, but until such time as 
“Bugs” Bear can be put under 
contract to write for the Tartan, 
I am perfectly content to forget 
the “downs” and concentrate on 
enjoying the “ups.” To me, Casey’s 
pungent wit is a most refreshing 
relief from the largely uninspiring 
literary efforts of some of the 
Tartan’s other staff reporters.
Certainly every man is entitled 
to his own opinion about End Man 
On The Senior Fence, but the re­
marks made in the opening sen­
tences of the letter in question 
strike me as being offensive and 
irresponsible. I think it is too bad 
you dignified them by publication!
Sincerely yours,
Robert L. Skinkle.
More
Dear Editor,
. . . There are a lot of people 
at Carnegie Tech who think Mis­
ter Casey’s column is one of the 
best features in the sheet. We 
think he is a riot.
We also think that he has a lot 
more on the ball than the one- 
track slipstick pushers. For one
thing he is versatile. He knows 
what’s new in the bookstalls, in 
radio, on the screen, on the stage, 
as well as what’s going on in the 
drama department at CIT. For 
another, he’s obviously alive. He 
doesn’t just exist, but gets a large 
charge out of everything every­
body does. Every line of every 
column of his stuff isn’t filled with 
slightly smelly jokes, but his stuff 
is amusing and different.
He looks at everything in an 
original, whimsical Caseytish light. 
His column is a bright light in the 
midst of endless announcements 
of physical, chemical, manage­
ment, aeronautical, and mathe­
matical meetings that interest no 
one but the engineers who go to 
them. End Man interests Maggie 
Murphs and Arts kids and even a 
few of the formulae-filled drips in 
EH, as well as people both in and 
out of fraternity groups.
Cook and Co. ask why they 
have to read the column. The an­
swer is simply, “They don’t.” I 
haven’t noticed any Gestapo 
agents delivered with my Tartans 
lately, and if they need reading 
material that badly, they can al­
ways read the literature on cig­
arette packs and candy wrappers.
In short, we want Casey, but 
good.
A Maggie Murph.
And Still More
In Reference to George Cook 
and his 35 cohorts!
. . . Casey has never failed to 
write a thoroughly refreshing and 
interesting column. To obliterate 
his column from the weekly Tar­
tan would be nothing short of a 
four-star tragedy. It wouldn’t be 
difficult to write 23 column inches 
praising Casey’s sagacity, wit, and 
inimitable flavor of writing . . .

Skibo Prices
Mesdames:
Until today and with consider­
able difficulty, we have managed 
to refrain from publicizing the
merits of the Beanery. Of course, 
when we think of the Beanery we 
immediately think of the term 
with which it is synonomous—- 
non-profit. It is, we think, well 
known to everyone that the Bean­
ery is a non-profit service. Since 
it is run on a non-profit basis, it 
certainly follows that the Beanery 
should be able to provide better 
food at more reasonable prices 
than can be found in off-campus 
restaurants. Sounds good, doesn’t 
it?
Now let us look at a few facts 
regarding the Beanery and its 
good food at reasonable prices. 
In so doing, we would like to pre­
sent first of all the immediate 
cause which prompted this letter. 
Today one of us ate lunch where 
we customarily go for dinner 
while the other ate at the Bean­
ery. By coincidence the menus 
were somewhat similar, at least 
basically.
At the Beanery the menu con­
sisted of beef loaf (??), potatoes, 
one roll, milk, and dessert. The 
price of this lunch was sixty- 
three cents. Now let us compare 
the above to the menu at a typical 
off-campus restaurant. At this 
particular eating place they served 
the following: soup, meat loaf, 
potatoes, another vegetable, two 
rolls, coffee, and dessert. Here 
the price was fifty cents.
The saving of thirteen cents ap­
pears insignificant at first. How­
ever, note that the off-campus 
lunch includes soup, another vege­
table, and an extra roll and much 
more of everything, especially the 
meat loaf, than was obtainable at 
the Beanery. The usual restaur­
ant service, of course, is much 
better than the well-known “lines 
of Skibo.” This is but one of 
many examples which might be 
cited.
Your article of October 15th 
defending the campus restaurants 
states that while Beanery prices 
have risen, they are relatively 
low as compared to the national 
average increase in food costs. 
This comparison is entirely un­
sound. The fact remains that 
prices at the Beanery are as high 
and in most cases higher than 
those in off-campus eating places 
while at the same time the quan­
tities are much less.
In conclusion, we would like to 
ask: Is the Beanery doing all it 
can to provide more and better 
food at lower prices?
Sincerely yours,
Walter G. Gall

Lack of publicity, uninteresting 
programs, and a general absence 
of enthusiasm have resulted in an 
almost empty Little Theater 
where outstanding religious and 
civic leaders speak to vacant seats 
and the chapel choir sings to the 
same vacuum.
Chapel services are sponsored 
by the different organizations who 
go to a great deal of trouble to 
obtain speakers.
Chapel choir also spends a lot 
of time to bring you good music.
If the organizations plan suffi­
ciently stimulating programs and 
if some of you coke-sipping stu­

it can help to bring the broken 
student body together and at the 
same time provide an enjoyable

SKIBO SCRAPS
Well, we’ve had bucket and 
shovel in hand all week trying to 
get across to the barracks, so al­
though meat is scarce, we’ve pick­
ed up plenty of dirt! Much of the 
aforementioned stuff could be 
found in semi-liquid form on the 
backs of our “mightr” eleven as 
of last Friday night. (Learning 
how to swim the hard way, aren’t 
they?)
Now we come to the department 
of inane questions which no one 
bothers wasting time considering 
anyhow. . . . Did Janet Duffet 
find the chewing gum she was so 
frantically looking for in Biology 
Lab. the other day? . . . Did Bob 
Morrison find the blind dates he 
was hunting? (for himself and 
wife, that is) . . . Is Bill (Suzy) 
Hall still fighting off the men he 
attracted when dressed in female 
attire at a recent Saturday night 
party? . . . Brown-eyed, ruby­
lipped Don (Donna) Wurdock was 
having the same trouble. . . . 
Is someone going to ask Sigma Nu 
Coulson about the “Beast”? . . .

over, but do you think the Tartan

Cocker, part Pekinese, who also 
hangs out at Skibo.
. . . Aurele Meunier has come 
back to see “Biz” Ritter, all the 
way from Norfolk too . . . John

New York, on a forty-eight hour 
pass, to have a date with Anne 
Sweeny............
There are lots of characters 
floating around school who read 
the gossip column every week and 
then bewail the fact that what 
they have done is not in print. Let 
all such souls realize that no one 
on the staff claims to be psychic 
and that we do not have a crystal 
ball that shows all and spells all, 
so if you would like something 
printed just put it on a piece of 
paper, address it to the Tartan 
and send it via inter-school mail.

The high standard maintained 
by August Binder in social and 
scholastic activities should serve 
as an object lesson to all students 
who wish to combine studies and 
activities in large portions and 
still remain in school. This
B.M.O.C. has an average factor of 
“only 3.16,” and his string of 
fourteen activity keys shows that 
his spare time is well occupied.
Augie, as he is known to his 
friends, now hails from Mt. 
Vernon, Indiana, although he 
originally lived in Seattle, Wash­
ington, and he came to Tech from 
there in August, 1943, under the 
auspices of a George Westinghouse 
scholarship. He is now carrying 
the prodigious load of 73 units, of 
which 54 are in graduate courses, 
and he expects to graduate in Jan­
uary, and to receive his Master’s 
Degree the following June, a feat 
not usually accomplished in nine 
semesters. After that . . . work 
fpr a while, perhaps a Doctor’s 
Degree in the future.
He has served as business man­
ager of the Technical, managing 
editor of the Tartan, head cheer­
leader, president of ODK, presi­
dent of Student Council, and treas­
urer of Delta Tau Delta. He is 
now a member of the Student- 
Faculty Liaison Committee, Tau 
Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, and Pi 
Delta Episoln, and president of 
Y-Cabinet. This is an impressive 
list, but it gives no conception of 
his engaging smile and pleasing 
personality.
Tech Endowment 
Ranks Sixteenth
The Carnegie Corporation’s gift 
of $8,000,000 makes Carnegie 
Tech the youngest of thirty-seven 
institutions having $10,000,000 or 
mpre in endowment. Carnegie 
Tech’s endowment is now slightly 
over $27,000,000, making it six­
teenth in size of endowment 
among American and Canadian 
colleges and universities , with 
Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Chi­
cago, and Northwestern leading 
the list.
The falling off of interest rates 
on safe investments has forced 
Carnegie Tech to put virtually all 
of the recently collected funds 
into the endowment fund. The 
heavy financial drain caused by 
the three semester programs of 
the last few years, the increasing 
cost of personnel and materials, 
and the demands for new equip­
ment resulting from wartime 
technological advances all have 
made these contributions vital to 
the continuance of the school’s 
work.
New Members Taken 
By Modern Dance Club
Six new members have been 
accepted by the Dance Club as 
a result of tryouts held on Octo­
ber 21. They are Ruth Kikta, 
Diana Kutchukian, Lillian Mac- 
surak, Shirley Felman, Lois Sloan, 
and Sorietta Silverman. This ad­
dition increases the number of 
members in the club to fourteen.
The club is planning a large 
and varied program for the com­
ing year, including a Freshman 
Welcome to be held on November
4 at 4:30 p. m. for all freshmen 
women and a program for par­
ents to be given on November 25 
at 7:15 p. m. These programs will 
serve to acquaint both the stu­
dents and their parents with the 
work of the Dance Club.
Jane Grim, senior Carnegie 
Tech architect, took two awards in 
a recent amateur photographic 
contest sponsored by the Pitts­
burgh Zoological Society. She 
submitted five pictures of bears 
taken at the Highland Park Zoo. 
One of these pictures, a shot of 
two polar bears, won a $5.00 hon­
orable mention award. Another 
merited a $1.00 consolation prize.
Jane became interested in pho­
tography only last year. Her suc­
cess in her first contest she at­
tributes to her Ciroflex camera, 
imported from Italy, a Wollensak 
lens, and Ansco Plenochrome film.
Besides the hours she spends in 
the drafting room and at the zoo, 
Jane finds time to be active in 
Newman Club, Women’s Athletic 
Association, and Chi Omega.
Two Dramats Get 
Playhouse Roles
Two Tech drama students are 
scheduled to appear as the leads 
in the next production at the 
Pittsburgh Playhouse which opens 
on November 7 and runs through 
November 22. Phyllis A. Love, 
junior, and A1 Checco, senior dra- 
mat, will play the parts of “Suzy” 
and “Mr. Law” respectively, in 
Bella and Sepwach’s comedy “Boy 
Meets Girl.” The play will be 
directed by Fred Burleigh.
The present Playhouse produc­
tion, “Both Your Houses” stars 
Carl Betz, who is also a Tech 
dramat. He plays the part of an 
idealistic young congressman, who 
struggles against the degrading 
influences of one of his older and 
more experienced compatriots.
AUGIE BINDER
His pet peeve is that individual 
so common on this campus—the 
engineer who closes his mind to 
everything outside the field of en­
gineering. Also, Augie doesn’t 
care for the city of Pittsburgh (too 
dirty and too old), but he has a 
rather definite liking for Carnegie 
Tech. Among his pleasures is 
food, spelled with a capital “F” 
and served in large quantities. 
After much thought, he decided 
that his favorite dish is pie a-la- 
mode.
When asked his opinion of Car­
negie women, he neatly avoided a 
definite reply by stating that he 
had always been able to find 
enough of them who were amus­
ing and pretty so that he had no 
objections to them.

26. The delegate, John J. Loftus, 
was elected at a special meeting 
Friday afternoon, October 25. The 
25th national conclave was enter­
tained by the Philae Temple on the 
Tech campus in 1941.
The fraternity will entertain 
the faculty and students of the 
department of architecture at a 
banquet to be held shortly before 
the Christmas vacation. The group 
has decided to resume^ the cus­
tom of awarding a bronze medal 
to the outstanding freshman ar­
chitectural student at the end of 
the year.
Last week the Scarabs elected 
the following officers:
Donald L. MacLachlan, presi­
dent; Loren C. Smith, vice-presi­
dent; Louis F. Valentour, secreta­
ry; Edward M. Bailey, Jr., treas­
urer; Homer W. Ludwig, sergeant- 
at-arms.
Scarab is a national honorary 
and professional fraternity found­
ed at the University of Ilinois in 
1909 for students of architecture. 
Philae, the local temple was or­
ganized in 1920.
Due to the war, it was discon­
tinued in 1943 and reorganized 
during the 1946 spring semester. 
Scarab is most interested in the 
promotion of architecture, graphic, 
and allied arts. The local chapter 
promises to be outstanding among 
the honoraries on campus this 
year.
A garguantuan beer-barrel cut 
in half lengthwise is decorating 
the driveway to Machinery Hall. 
Four members of the Carnegie 
Tech faculty are using it as homes. 
These Quonset huts, as they are 
ordinarily called, were the ob­
jective of an expedition under­
taken by your Tartan reporter.
I pushed my way through a 
crowd of students curiously peer­
ing into the first house and cour­
ageously knocked on the door. 
Getting no answer, I stooped to 
peek through the window and 
discovered that no one was home.
At the third house I met with 
success. The professor and his 
wife were there and graciously 
invited me in to look around. The 
house, like all the rest, has a liv­
ing room, a bedroom, a kitchen, a 
bathroom, a utility sink, a hot 
water heater, bathroom fixtures, 
and a stove for the living room.
The storage space consists of 
one cabinet with one shelf which 
might hold a doll’s wardrobe. 
There is another slight inconveni­
ence; the curved walls are de­
cidedly ill-adapted for the hang­
ing of pictures, drapes, or cab­
inets. My host is still looking for 
a place to put his white steel 
kitchen cupboard.
The school plans to use the huts
as homes for two years, then to 
use them for storage. But in the 
meantime they will be occupied 
by people who have a right to 
some privacy. So please restrain 
your curiosity. The people living 
there are normal human beings 
and are not on display.

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 29. 1946
TECH SPORTS
TECH SPORTING SCENE
By Dick Heckman
The Geneva game Friday night was played under con­
ditions which were about as bad as anyone could ask. Not only 
was the field a sea of mud but the air above the field was filled 
with all sorts of things. The first was rain. The second was 
the by-product of the Cork Works around the corner. The 
wind carried the smoke from the left-over corks right down
Beamer Sets Record, 
Harriers Down Geneva
On a rain-soaked course, Guy Halferty’s Tech Harriers pounded 
out their second victory in as many starts this season when they 
turned back the Geneva College runners, 21-34. The victory was the 
only one garnered by the three Tartan varsities over the week-end.
In the course of events, which featured mud, mud and more mud,
Captain Bill Beamer of the visiting Skibos set a new course record
for the 3% mile distance. The Bounding One loped around the soggy
outskirts of Beaver Falls, Pa. in 19:30 thus erasing the previous record
set by Geneva’s ace, Crawford, earlier this year. Beamer’s effort 
clipped 45 seconds from the mark.
Tartans finishing behind Beamer in respective order were: Paul 
Rotzler, third; Gene Cockerell, fourth; Igor Davies, fifth; Vince Benya, 
eighth. The Covenanters garnered 2nd, 6th, 7th. 9th and 10th positions.
All four spectators who witnessed the Tartan victory joined in 
with Three Silent Cheers and a Grunt for the Tartan jack-rabbits as
the football field and visibility 
was nil. One of Karcis’ punts in 
the third quarter went up yon­
der and got lost in the fog. There 
was one other disadvantage to the 
sweet essence of cork. Confiden­
tially, it stunk!
One of the Tech crowd of 100 
which tagged along with the grid- 
ders was Mel House, who, when 
everybody was discouraged about 
the game, came up with the classic 
remark, “It’s easy to see they’re 
not mudders. They’re all fodders.”
Another sad witness to the de- 
batacle was one whose name we 
won’t mention. Anyhoo, this 
Nameless One had come in con­
tact with a fifth of Schenley’s and 
had shared a guzzle or two with 
his cohorts at the game. He was 
about to putt the “baby” from his 
pocket for another snort when 
who should walk up but his fath­
er. It seems his dad resides in 
Beaver Falls and had come to the 
game without telling The Name­
less One he was going to be pres­
ent. Father and Son spent the rest 
of the game standing side by side 
while Son kept both hands in his 
pockets to conceal the bulge. (Hi 
ya, Bob.)
Our heartfelt sympathy goes out 
to George Maley arid his gang of 
managers. The boys have really 
had their work cut out for them 
trying to get the football uniforms 
clean what with all the mud 
which has been present whenever 
the football team has stepped on 
the field. The new gold pants 
which the school bought at the 
beginning of the season came back 
from the cleaner still gold, but 
they didn’t have that certain spar­
kle. The poor cleaner will be 
lucky to get them from their pres­
ent black state back to a dull tan 
[Continued on page 7]
Slippery Rock invaded the Tech 
campus Saturday morning, and the 
Greasy Stone booters banged their 
way to a well-earned, hard-fought 
victory over the Tech forces, 2-1. 
For the Profs, it was the second 
win of the season over the Skibos, 
the first one coming two weeks 
ago, by a count of 2-0. The un­
beaten Rockets have now notched
5 wins against 0 losses this season 
and have three shutouts to their 
credit.
The Tartans gave evidence that 
they are a vastly improved outfit 
over the one which met the visit­
ors a fortnight ago and Slippery 
Rock was hard-pressed to squeeze 
out a victory. The Skibos showed 
that they were not going to be 
pushed around when, in the open­
ing monets of the ball game, 
Marmo, Tech outside-left, broke 
through the Rockets’ defense after 
taking a nice pass to rack up 
Tech’s marker, the second goal 
to be tallied against Slippery Rock 
in five games to date. The Tartans 
were not content with this and 
continued to play heads-up ball 
for the entire quarter, keeping the 
Rockets with their backs to the 
wall. Only once did the visitors 
threaten the Tartans’ goal in the 
period. Handchen, Rocket star 
center-forward, who played the 
entire game with a cast on his 
broken hand, broke through the 
Skibo defense and came in on the 
Tech goal all alone. “Hench” got 
too anxious, however, and kicked 
the sphere over the top of the 
goal.
Tech enjoyed its slim-lead as 
the teams changed ends for the 
second period. The Tech forward
Intramural 
Roundup
The second week of intramural 
touch football featured nine con­
tests and one day of rain. It was 
a dull week with few close games 
and no upsets.
The Beta Sigs and PiKA’s dom­
inated while the Kilroy A. C. and 
the TX’s topped the National and 
the Delts shared honors with the 
boys from Barracks No. 2 in the Federal.
The Beta Sigs ran up a score of 
15-0 in the first three quarters 
of their game with the Dorm 
Combine and then coasted to a 
15-7 victory. Kohn and Levy 
split the scoring privileges for 
the Beta Sigs, and Voytic snag­
ged a pass on the fly for the Com­
bine TD.
A last period five-pointer sav­
ed the day for the PiKA’s as they 
overcame the SAE’s 7-3. The 
F. P. H. A. outfit forfeited the 
remainder of their games.
A pair of massacres were the 
main attractions i!n the National 
League. The T. N. T.’s, bouncing 
back from their heart-breaking 
defeat at the hands of the Kilroy 
A. C., combined three long passes 
and a 60-yard interception by 
Katselas to down the Beta’s 21-2. 
The TX’s piled up twenty while 
the DU’s settled for a single 
point.
Kilroy A. C. racked up six ~ 
points per period to take the Phi 
Kaps 24-11. The Phi Kaps had 
their day too, as they beat the 
DU’s 17-11. The DU’s, who were 
held to one point by the TX’s,

line kept up its stellar play and 
came within a hair of having two 
more goals as the visitors’ goalie 
stood helpless in the mud. How­
ever, good defensive play on the 
part of the Slippery Rock full­
backs kept the score as it was, and 
the teams walked off the field for 
the intermission with the score 
still Tech 1, Slippery Rock 0.
The visitors were a new ball 
club when they resumed opera­
tions. They constantly beat the 
Tartans to the ball and soon made 
it look like they would run away 
with the affair. The tired Tech 
line could do no more than get 
the ball into the Rocket half of 
the field before they had it taken 
away from them. Only seconds 
had elapsed before the visitors 
tied the score. Davis, Slippery 
Rock outside-right, brought the 
ball down deep into Tech terri­
tory and put it across the middle 
of the goal where 10 feet went 
after it and the ball popped 
straight up in the air. Everyone 
lost track of it but Handchen who 
banged it home for the visitors’ 
first tally.
A moment later the big center- 
forward broke through again and 
beat the Tech defense to close in 
on the goal alone. The Tech goalie 
got to the ball at the same time 
Handchen let fly, and it bounced 
straight up to Handchen’s chest 
and caromed into the goal. The 
Rockets kept the pressure on and 
pushed down toward the Tech 
goal time and again, but Kindblom 
and McGehee, Tech fullbacks, 
played flawlessly and saved Tech 
further punishment.
Pep Rally on Tap 
Friday in Bowl
In case anybody’s interested 
the Tech Bowl is 120 yards long 
and 53 yards wide. After much 
maneuvering on the slide rule we 
find that it contains 6400.2 sq. 
yds. At a square yard per person 
the Bowl will accommodate 6400.2 
people. Certainly it would seem 
that at least 3486.69 (we call them 
humans) could squeeze them­
selves in around a bon-fire.
Yes, Tech is going to have a 
PEP RALLY for the home coming 
football game. On Friday night, 
November 1, at 8:00 p. m. the 
cheerleaders? ? ! ! ! hope to make 
the Bowl re-echo with all the 
rousing Tartan Cheers.
Among .the luminaries to be 
present will be Tech’s head foot­
ball coach, Bill Donohoe and A1 
Manetti, who is our long-time 
famous cheerleader. The Kilties' 
will be there in force to supply 
some of the noise (let’s hope not 
all), and the team, in its usual 
fashion, will be the inspiration for 
the occasion.
All this tells the story but for 
one thing. The rest is up to YOU, 
the students of Carnegie Tech. We 
all realize that Tech isn’t going 
to play in the Sugar Bowl as it 
did in 1938, but those fellows 
playing football have as much 
spirit, push and ambition as a 
championship team. All they ask 
is your support; come to the PEP 
RALLY, come to the game. W&J 
might be good, but Tech can be 
better! ! Let’s all pitch in and 
make this ’46 Homecoming some­
thing long to be remembered.
W&J Gridders 
Here Sat.
This Saturday the Tartans will 
return to Forbes Field to per­
form before the Homecoming 
alumni in hopes of hitting the 
glory road. The tough W&J 
Presidents will furnish the op­
position and Tech will again en­
ter the Pirates’ Lair in the role of 
underdogs.Long Rivalry
The W. & J.-Tech football riv­
alry has been long and hard 
fought. It dates back to days of 
bustles and handle-bar mustaches. 
In 1906 the Tartans sported a 
football team for the first time 
and the Prexies were on hand to 
make the launching a dismal fail­
ure as they walloped Tech by a 
score of 34-0. Since then the two 
schools have met twenty times 
with W. & J. holding the over­
whelming edge of twelve victories 
against three, with five ending in 
ties. The last meeting took place 
in 1933 which ended in a scoreless 
deadlock.
This year the Prexies are sport­
ing one of the best teams in re­
cent history. Led by Deacon Dan 
Fowler, the Presidents boast a 
record of three victories in five 
tries. They have bowled over 
Bethany, Dennison, and Dickinson 
while losing to Geneva and Laf­
ayette, the latter by a one-point 
margin.
The Geneva game was a costly 
one for Coach Donohoe, Russ 
Skinner, Tech’s powerful full­
back who had been sidelined with 
a knee injury from the beginning 
of the season and was just be­
ginning to recuperate enough to 
take over his old slot for full duty, 
was the recipient of another jolt 
on the knee which may force him 
out of the game for the remainder 
of the season.
Otherwise the team came out 
in good physical shape. The prob­
able lineup for Saturday’s per­
formance will be: Miller and Wil­
liamson at ends, De Muesey and 
Myers at tackles, Captain Back- 
larz and Guttendorf at guards and 
Groomes at center. The backfield 
will be in shape of Maley at 
quarter, Highberger and Pappa- 
fava at halfs, and Wahrenburg at 
full.
W.A.R. Active 
Hockey in Light
The W.A.A. field hockey team is 
practicing every Monday and 
Wednesday afternoon at 4:30 on 
the Cut in preparation for its 
game with PCW on November 18. 
Although the season is half over, 
new recruits are welcome espe­
cially if they have had four or 
more years experience playing 
varsity hockey for Harvard, Yale, 
Army, or Notre Dame.
Dance Club, a part of the Wom­
en’s Athletic Association, held 
try-outs on October 21. Six new 
members were added to the club 
enrollment.
The tennis courts are open for 
W.A.A. at scheduled hours. A list 
of these hours is posted in the 
Women’s Gym Office.
Archery is scheduled for Wed­
nesday at 3:30 and Thursday at 
4:30. A lot of girls are participat­
ing in this sport.
The swimming pool is open for 
co-ed swimming Wednesday eve­
nings from 7:00 until 9:30, and 
Saturday afternoons from 2:00 
until 4:00, except when home 
football games are(,being played.
The ping-pong tables are ready 
for use and the gym facilities are 
always available. Be sure to sign 
up all your hours on the sheets in 
the locker room.

Sporting Scene

this time. For the benefit of those 
who come in late to the two Tech 
games this year, Tech’s jerseys 
are red and the helmets are white 
with a red stripe.
Incidently, the revised form of 
the dictionary shows that George 
is not “The Coach’s Dope.” The 
new pronunciation finds it chang­
ed to “Malay, the Coach’s Dopay.” 
A guy who will be remember­
ed by those few who saw the soc­
cer team in action last year ap­
peared at the game Saturday. He’s 
Bob Williams, last year’s star cen- 
ter-halfback. It turns out Bob 
has done gone and got himself 
married. Congrats, Robert. 
f Had to have my arm twisted to 
get me to go to that Pitt-Purdue 
game Saturday, but when it was 
over, there were no regrets. It 
was the best finish I ever saw or 
heard about. I’ll bet there wasn’t 
anyone in the end-zone seats be­
hind the Pitt goal who thought 
the field-goal would be good. 
From that point it looked like the 
Pitt line had smothered the ball. 
But the pigskin got away and Pitt 
lost a heartbreaker.
The Kentucky Wonder, C. T. 
Butler, won’t be leading the pa­
rade for “Senator Claghom for 
President” or playing basketball 
for Tech this fall. The Paintsville 
Flash has decided to give Uncle 
Sam a break and has enlisted in 
the Marine Corps. Still true to 
the South, he is presently resid­
ing in South Carolina.

third quarter after the Phi Kaps 
had a 17-0 lead.
The Federal contests featured 
the Delts tripping the Musical 
Maulers 23-14 for their second 
victory of the season, the Kappa 
Sigs walking over the Sigma Nu’s 
17-1, and the ATO s losing 7-2 
to the boys from F. P. H. A. No. 2.
Friday’s games which were 
drowned out will be played on 
Monday, November 11.
The game of the week promises 
to be Friday’s contest when the 
Kilroy A. C. plays host to TX on 
field number one. Interesting also 
should be the Kappa Sig-Delt 
battle on Wednesday at four- 
thirty.
Intramural wrestling starts to­
morrow. The grapplers will meet 
Monday,- Wednesday, and Thurs­
day from 4:30 to 5:30 under the 
aTble: direction of Coach C. G. 
Alexander in Thistle Hall. It is 
a great sport for anyone with 
muscles, agility, and intelligence.
Bowling entries are due Friday 
at five. The leagues will be drawn 
and the competition will begin on 
November 23. The bowling will 
be on Saturday afternoons from 
12:30 to 3:00.
Next on the intramural list are 
volley ball and table tennis. An­
nouncements will be released this 
week.
Typist Needed
Typists and stenographers 
are urgently needed for work 
on the CARNEGIE TECH­

this work will be welcomed at 
the TECHNICAL office this 
Saturday from 10:30 through 
4:00.

Here’s Mud in Your Eye!
Maggie Murph Frosh Engage 
In Bloody Election Campaign
For three periods, a gallant 
Carnegie Tech grid aggregation 
put up a magnificent fight against 
a more experienced Geneva Col­
lege eleven Friday night, but a 
wild fourth quarter ruined the 
Tartans’ hopes and they were 
whipped 36-0. Mud was the order 
of the day once again as the 
Skibos took the field for the sec­
ond time this year, and both 
teams were partially held in 
check by the soggy turf thruogh- 
out. The Tartans succeeded in 
bottling up they vaunted Geneva 
back, Larry Bruno, tout the Cov­
enanters’ other ace, Adafn Kar- 
cis, was not to be denied. Kar- 
cis ran, passed and kicked his 
team to an 18-0 lead before retir­
ing to the sidelines early in the 
fourth quarter. •
The rain which started Friday 
afternoon was still coming down 
as the game got underway, and 
the two squads had to be content 
with a punting duel throughout 
the first stanza. Karcis and Sam 
Highberger of Tech punted each 
other to a standstill until early in 
the second quarter when Karcis 
booted one out of bounds on the 
Tech 5. After Highberger kicked 
out of danger, the Covies got a 
drive under way which carried to 
the Tech 18 before Ben Baklarz 
broke it up by falling on a fumble 
by Bruno. Again Highberger 
banged the ball up the field and 
Karcis returned to the mid field 
stripe. The rain had stopped by 
this time, and the Geneva backs 
started to roll. A series of line 
plays brought four first downs and 
put the ball on Tech’s 2-yard 
stripe. Karcis and Bruno could 
make no headway through the 
stubborn Tech line, but Bruno 
skirted <pnd for the score. Bruno 
hit the line in the attempt for 
the extra point but was stopped 
cold.
Bruno Scores Again
The Covies took the second half 
kick-off and went straight down 
the field to the Tech 17, where
they were momentarily halted. 
Karcis then dropped back and hit 
Letteri with a pass, the latter 
carrying to the Tech 2 where 
Bruno barged over.
The ensuing kickoff was taken 
by Highberger, who almost got in­
to the clear, and was finally stop­
ped on the Geneva 48. The Tar­
tans got their first threat of the 
night under way, and Pappafava 
led the way to the Geneva 14 
where the Covies held and took 
the ball on downs. A few plays 
later, Karcis intercepted a Tech 
pass and started Geneva on the 
road to pay dirt once more. With 
the ball on the Geneva 40, Kar­
cis went back in kick-formation 
and threw a strike to Letteri who 
made his way to the Tech 20. 
Tech took the ball on downs, but 
fumbled and Geneva got the ball 
on the Tech 27 as the quarter 
ended.
Last Period Fatal For Tech
This set the stage for the most 
hair-raising period seen in quite 
a while. There’s no sense talking 
about it any more than to say it 
was “just one of those things”. 
The Tartans, no matter how hard 
they tried, just couldn’t do any­
thing right and when the smoke 
had cleared, Geneva had three 
gift touchdowns and a fourth via 
the air and wound up the ball 
game on top by 36-0.
The Tartans are home for a 
Homecoming encounter against 
W. and J. this Saturday and are 
pointing for their first win of the 
year. With a little luck from the 
weather man, they should be able 
to get the “T” functioning and 
give a good account of themselves.

Do you want less work, fewer 
classes, later permissions, and 
more time? If so, vote for Hope­
less Hooples, fearless defender of 
law and order and of more dates 
for girls. So starts Maggie Murph’s 
election campaign.
Candidates are runn:ng madly 
for the offices of president, vice- 
president (who is runner-up in 
presidential votes) , secretary 
treasurer, Senate representative, 
and Women’s Guild representa­
tive. For two weeks prospective 
officers have been collecting auto­
graphs on petition slips, pasting 
slogans, and, like Squirt, generally 
getting in the public eye.
Pictures and slogans are plas­
tered all over Maggie Murph’s 
freshman bulletin board. Presi­
dential candidate Mary Nettle- 
ton says, “Know your candidate,” 
and has pasted her picture just to 
make sure. Two cards saying, 
“Use your head, vote for Red,” 
announce Nancy Williams’ presi­
dential aspirations. Also stimulat­
ing the presidential campaign is a 
poster proclaiming, “Georgiana 
Popovitch, she’s all right! Who’s 
all right? Georgia!”
Prospective Senate representa­
tive as well as hopeful presidents 
are campaigning furiously. Rose-
Beta Sigs Get House
The former Pickering estate at 
1051 Morewood Avenue was turn­
ed over to the Beta Sigma Rho 
fraternity on October 15 for their 
use as a fraternity house by Law­
rence H. Miller, school controller 
in charge of housing. The house 
was originally acquired by the 
school for use as a dormitory for 
Westinghouse students, and has 
not been used by a fraternity be­
fore.
The school’s petition to re-zone 
the section and permit use of the 
house by a fraternity was delayed 
more than two weeks by the pow­
er strike, and final action was not 
taken until two weeks ago.
Some thirty men are now liv­
ing in the three-story home.
mary Wertz plans to “Make your 
vote count.” Freda Alexander 
states her platform by asking, “Do 
you like luscious tomatoes and 
hearty beef?” Ruth Davis is also 
in there pitching.
Peggy McGuire informs the 
voters, “You have seen the rest! 
So now see the best,” in announc­
ing her intention of running for 
Women’s Guild representative. 
Providing stiff competition, Lois 
Sloan affirms, “We ain’t much fer 
furs, a hunk’s burlap will do fer 
us.”
“Gee, I’d like to be your treas­
urer,” says Diane Turner, whose 
picture adorns her poster. Doreen 
Evans also does her treasurer- 
advertising by photograph.
The two candidates for secre­
tary are Genie Kober, “Keen 
Queen for Secretary,” and Shirley 
Felman, “We Aren’t Crowded — 
We Gotta Go and Vote for Shir­
ley.”
This fever-pitch campaigning 
comes to a climax on Tuesday, 
October 29, between 8:30 and 
11:30 a. m. in Maggie Murph’s 
front hall, when the voters cast 
their ballots. All the candidates 
are slyly warning their friends to 
bring registration cards in order 
to vote. Remember, “he who 
neither votes nor thinks can’t 
complain if government is ineffi­
cient.”

tion undertook then to centralize 
the interests of the veterans and 
to create a common ground upon 
which they could meet to solve 
their problems.
Some concrete examples of the 
accomplishments of the Tecvets 
may be seen in their cooperation 
in the alleviation of the housing 
shortage, and in the great aid they 
have extended to the Vets center. 
They have also been the sponsors 
of a number of very successful so­
cial events, the most outstanding 
being the annual Tecvets Easter 
Parade.

"It” On the Senior Fence
End Man Replies
In writing this week’s column, 
the End Man is faced with two 
serious problems. Problem Num­
ber One is where can he buy a 
slow poison without a prescrip­
tion? Problem Number Two is 
the dire shortage of chartreuse 
(perfumed) ink in which to print 
this cdlumn. Seeing that the End 
Man has two strikes against him 
from the very start, the End Man 
has no intention whatsoever of 
filling up this column with a lot of 
inanities which would repulse 
some of the Elsie Dinsmore’s of 
the Engineering College.
And someone once said it so 
much better than the End Man 
could—“Slander is the supreme 
compliment the Dull pay to the 
Imaginative.”
Next week, unless we’ve gone 
off to Make It A Million, this 
column will be back to normal.
[Ed. Note]
(In which the End Man wishes 
Pittsburgh were in Southern Cal­
ifornia and come to think of it, 
it’s a darn good idea!)

Sigma Alpha Iota 
Has Six Recitals
Sigma Alpha Iota, honorary 
women’s fraternity in the depart­
ment of music, will present a ser­
ies of six recitals this year. Solo­
ists on these programs will be 
members of the Music Department.
The first program will feature 
music of the “classical compos­
ers,” including Bach, Haydn, 
Handel, and Mozart. Later pre­
sentations will include works from 
the romantic, impressionistic, and 
contemporary periods. One pro­
gram will be a presentation of 
music in the jazz idiom.
- No tickets are required for the 
recitals which will be held in the 
Exhibition room of the Fine Arts 
building. Dates of the events will 
be announced at a later date.

Four Shouts to the Wind De­

Letter To The Editor in a recent 
Tartan by Messrs. Eschenbach 
and Wilde. I’ve been banging into 
the Skibo doors too — but I 
thought it was just me. Shout 
Two is for the boys in the Bar­
racks for not complaining too 
much about the obvious fact that 
we have neither heat nor hot wa­
ter. Shout Three is for the Ad­
ministration and their terrific 
orientation - of - new - students 
program. Reports from other col­
leges show that everything is all 
messed up elsewhere. Shout Four 
is for the legion of people who 
shared their cars with all of us

Four Burps to the Breeze De­
partment: Burp One is for the 
Elegy for The Good Old Days 
written in the Tartan last week; 
which not only seemed inane but 
exceptionally bad taste for the 
second edition of a school paper. 
Burp Two is for the new ruling 
in Skibo and the Beanery which 
makes you go to the very end 
of the line to get a cup of coffee 
or an ice cream cone. Burp Three 
is for the Bookstore which seems 
to be out of everything with the 
exception of scotch tape and for 
the teachers who keep giving as­
signments in books you can’t get. 
Burp Four is for the lack of lock­
ers in the Art School; at least one- 
half of all boys in the Art School 
have to carry everything around 
with them all day.
Get Me Department: It’s been 
many a day since the American 
movie-going public has seen as 
bad a movie as “The Big Sleep;” 
ferheavensake, even Miss Guber- 
man didn’t understand it. And 
all of you who did see “The Bak­
er’s Wife” at the Art Cinema 
should feel real good; as for 
“Moonlight Sonata” — well . .
Hey, who took my copy of “The 
Iceman Cometh”? Huh? If you’ve 
been listening to the radio, you’ve 
probably been noticing the De­
cline and Fall of Jack Benny and 
others who have consistently been 
among the foremost. Good writ­
ers, in Hollywood, must be at a 
premium—either that or the stars 
are piping their material in from 
some conveniently located granite 
orchard. On the other hand, 
fifteen minute programs like the 
Chesterfield Supper Club, Jean 
Sablon, and others have never 
been as good.

against him. German can go to

members made a total of 65 peo­
ple who danced and sang during 
the evening. Due to the weather 
a scavanger hunt which had been 
planned was indefinitely post­
poned.
Professor Norman Dawes, the 
clan sponsor, was present, as were 
several alumni, including Walt 
Gretzler, past president. The clan, 
under the leadership of president 
Don Anderson, plans a jukebox 
dance on campus in about two or 
three weeks.
Beaux Arts Honorary
At the informal meeting of the 
Beaux Arts Honorary Society 
held on Tuesday, October 22, the 
following officers were elected: 
Lee Watkins, president; Bert Pol­
lock, vice-president; Esther Haus- 
halter, secretary; Frances Quill, 
treasurer.
plans are in the making for the 
annual Beaux Arts Ball. The date 
has not been definitely set as yet, 
but it is expected to be immedi­
ately after midsemester so that a

ficial meeting, attendance of all 
members is required.
Aero Club
At the Aero Club’s regular 
meeting on Thursday, October 24, 
the group concluded arrangements 
for a club hayride to be held Wed­
nesday, November 6. The hayride, 
which will be at Dollman’s Farm 
beside Eastwood Swimming Pool, 
will be augmented by dancing and 
eating and will begin at 8:00 p. m.
When these plans had been 
made, H. Warren Plohr presented 
a technical paper on the Davis 
air-foil. This paper was the first 
of a series of technical discus­
sions planned by the club this 
fall.
Home Economics
Miss Helena Benitez, the head 
of the home economics depart­
ment of the Philippine Women’s 
University at Manila, spoke to the 
Home Economics club on Wed­
nesday, October 13, about the 
hardships which faced the Philip­
pine people under Japanese rule. 
Miss Benitez had previously spok­
en at the convention of the Amer­
ican National Dietetics Associa­
tion in Chicago.
Although the University was 
completely demolished, the facul­
ty and students have every hope of 
rebuilding it in the future. Miss 
Benitez assured the club that any 
interest shown by Americans in 
the rebuilding of the Philippine 
Women’s University was certain 
to be appreciated.
PiKA’s To Select 
Girl of the Month
You’ve all heard of the Man of 
the Year, but have, you heard of 
the Girl of the Months? The 
Pi K A’s have decided that they 
will choose a girl each month 
whom they consider really tops. 
Their first candidate will be se­
lected for the month of November 
and will be invited to have din­
ner at the house on November 6.
D^an Yon will also be a guest 
at this dinner. Miss Pi K A of 
November will not only have din­
ner with the entire fraternity but 
she will also be presented with 
an orchid!
Before all you would-be glamour 
gals rush out to enroll in the Du- 
Barry Success plan, you might 
look over the basis for the month­
ly selection. The Girl of the 
Month will be chosen for her ac- 
a d e m i c standing, appearance, 
campus activities, and popularity.

The extensive rpnnvatincr nnrlAr J
Radio Club
An organizational meeting of
C.I.T.’s Radio Club was attended 
Saturday, October 19, by 40 old 
and new members. President Bill 
Kearns explained the purposes 
and aims of the club. Several po­
sitions are open for students in­
terested in any phase of electron­
ics, from building small one tube 
sets to work on large transmit­
ters, and from qualifying for a 
“ham” license to operating the 
club’s amateur “rig” atop Ma­
chinery Hall. Classes begin with 
elementary theory and continue 
through to more complicated 
work in advanced radio. Instruc­
tion is also offered for those who 
wish to build their own receivers 
or other electronic equipment.
The club has recently acquired 
an ultra-high-frequency radar 
set. Work on this equipment will 
constitute one of the projects for 
advanced members this semester.
New members are always cor­
dially invited to attend meetings 
of the group which are held every 
Saturday at 2:30 in room 401, Ma­
chinery Hall.
Dramats Present!
William Saroyan’s play “Time 
of Your Life” will open at 8:30 
p. m. tonight in the Little Theater 
of the Fine Arts building. This is 
the first of a series of eight pro­
ductions to be presented this year. 
It will run from October 29 to No­
vember 6, with Mr. Henry Boett­
cher, head of the drama depart-% 
ment, directing the show. Tickets 
are no longer available at the Reg­
istrar’s Office, but any seats va­
cant after 8:15 may be filled by 
those without tickets.
The extensive renovating under 
way in the southwestern corner of 
Industries Hall is leading toward 
new classrooms and laboratories 
for the Printing Department, ac­
cording to Mr. Stanley C. Hlasta, 
associate professor of printing.
“We have the highest enroll­
ment ever recorded, in common 
with every other section of the 
school,” Mr. Hlasta said, “and 
this means that working space 
must be increased. We also plan 
to include lecture rooms and study 
halls in our corner of the building, 
so that the department may be 
self-sufficient.”
There are 128 students enrolled 
in printing, representing twenty- 
eight states and three foreign 
countries.
Dr. Douglas F. Miner is now 
acting head of the department, in 
addition to his other duties, hav- 
replaced Prof. Lawrence Sieg­
fried, who returned to his former 
position at the University of Syr­
acuse.
Script Contest 
Deadline Extended
The script and musical score 
contest of the Scotch and Soda 
Club has been extended for two 
weeks. The new deadline for the 
submission of scripts to be used 
in their Spring Carnival show 
is Nov. 14. Prizes will be given 
for the winning script and musi­
cal score.
The Scotch and Soda Club, 
which was inactive during the 
war, was temporarily reformed in 
the fall of 1945 through the efforts 
of Danny Franks and Helen Mill­
er. Last spring the club presented 
the musical “Take It From Here.” 
Permanent reorganization is plan­
ned for the near future, and all 
who are interested in either the 
contest or participation in the 
musical are welcome.
Miss Christine Allen Becomes 
Member Of Ph. Ed. Department
MISS ALLEN
On the first day of school a 
cute, young, “five foot two, eyes 
of blue” blonde wandered into 
Skibo and joined the end of a 
promising dinner line. She was 
happy to see trays piled high with 
delicious - looking food, and 
thought to herself, “Ah, hah! I’m 
going to like this school!” Her 
dreams were quickly shattered, 
however, when she was informed 
that she was in the football team 
line and could not be served. She 
assured the tyrant of the steam 
table that she was a sharpie at 
right tackle—but still no dinner.
This young hopeful was the 
newest addition to the faculty of 
Carnegie Tech, the women’s phys­
ical education tejicher. Miss 
Christine Allen. She is a gradu­
ate of the Bouve-Boston School 
of Physical Education and Phys­
ical Therapy, a division of Tufts 
College. Before coming to Tech, 
Miss Allen spent a year and six 
months teaching occupational 
therapy at Valley Forge General 
Hospital.
Two Carnegie Tech music stu­
dents, Jane Ginnevan and Dottie 
Hallas, have the feminine leads in 
the Pittsburgh Savoyards, forth­
coming production. The operetta, 
in accordance with Savoyard’s 
tradition, will be “The Gondoliers” 
by Gilbert and Sullivan. It will be 
presented Thanksgiving night at 
the Syria Mosque.
The musical director of the pro­
duction will be Laurence Bur­
rows; the drama director will be 
John Weishood. Miss Martha Eg- 
gins of the Carnegie Tech faculty 
is directing publicity.
The Savoyards whose specialty 
is Gilbert and Sullivan are be­
ginning their ninth year of pro­
duction.
Jane Ginnevan, a member of 
Chi Omega, will play the part of
She was very active at college, 
being a member of the student 
government, and the captain of 
one of the two teams into which 
the school was divided for athletic 
competition. She spent summer 
vacations as a counselor at a girls’ 
camp on Cape Cod, and winter 
vacations were spent at a ski re­
sort. She passes her free time 
knitting and is an expert at Ar- 
gyle socks. At present she is con­
templating socks with a reindeer 
pattern to match a reindeer sweat­
er.
Miss Allen has a lot of new 
ideas for the physical education 
department and for the Women’s 
Athletic Association. She is a field 
hockey enthusiast and is interest­
ed in organizing a varsity team in 
that sport. At present she is ex­
perimenting with two-hour hockey 
classes, which would be much 
more valuable as instructional 
classes than the usual one-hour 
periods. In the fall sports pro­
gram, Miss Allen will teach rid­
ing as well as hockey.
Chapel Choir
The Chapel Choir started their 
season’s rehearsals on Tuesday, 
October 22. The choir, the only 
mixed chorus on campus, is under 
the direction of Chuck Tritle.
At their rehearsal the choir 
practiced Listen to the Lamps, 
in preparation for the first chapel 
on Nov. 5. Joan Baily will be 
featured orgaaist.
At present the choir has sixty- 
two applicants, but it needs tenors 
and basses. Meetings are held in 
the Exhibition Room of the Fine 
Arts Building every other Tues­
day. The next rehearsal is sched­
uled for Oct. 29th at 11:30 a. m.
DOROTHY HALLAS
Scarab Plans 
Sketch Exhibit
The local chapter of Scarab held 
three meetings last week in pre­
paration for a full calendar of 
service and social activity for the 
coming year. Present plans include 
a sketch exhibit, a banquet for 
the architectural students, repre­
sentation at the national Scarab 
convention, and the presentation 
of the Freshman Bronze Medal.
The first event of the year will 
be the competitive sketch exhibit 
open to all students of the depart­
ment of architecture. Sketches 
rendered in any medium are eli­
gible.
The winning sketches of the lo­
cal exhibit will be entered in the 
national competitive /exhibit }to 
be held concurrently with the na­
tional Scarab convention. At the 
close of the convention, the ex­
hibit makes a circuit of all the 
architectural schools associated 
with the fraternity.
Philae Temple, local chapter of 
Scarab will be represented at the 
27th national convention in Law­
rence, Kansas, November 24 to

Former Techite 
Plays At'Benefit
Earl Wild, pianist, who was at 
one time a student at Carnegie 
Tech, will appear with the Pitts­
burgh Symphony under the baton 
of Morton Gould, on Tuesday 
evening, Oct. 29. Mr. Wild re­
cently returned from a recital 
tour in Canada.
A soloist for the American 
Broadcasting Company, he fre­
quently plays on radio programs. 
Last Saturday he conducted a con­
cert program of the ABC Sym­
phony. One number on the pro­
gram was an orchestration of 
Dohnanyi’s Rhapsody in C Major. 
Another composition was the 
Grieg Piano Concerto, with Mr. 
Wild as soloist.
When Earl Wild was a student 
at Tech he gave daily noontime 
recitals in the Exhibition Room, 
which were always crowded with 
students from all colleges on Cam­
pus. Although he had graciously 
offered to give us a similar treat 
while he is in Pittsburgh this fall, 
the demands of his schedule pre­
vent Mr. Wild from giving us this 
pleasure.

Prof. W. Harper 
Will Be Speaker 
At A VC Meeting
Professor W. Harper of Carne­
gie Tech’s English department 
will speak at the business meet­
ing of the Pittsburgh All-College 
Chapter of the American Veterans 
Committee on Wednesday, Octo­
ber 30, at 7:30 P. M., at the Belle- 
field Presbyterian Church, Belle- 
field and Fifth Avenue. The events 
which took place at the recent 
Pennsylvania convention of the 
A.V.C. will be discussed as will 
the prospects and details of the 
organization’s forthcoming social 
affair.
The local chapter of the A.V.C. 
is composed of students from Car­
negie Tech, Duquesne, and Pitt, 
and is open to all students of these

A.P.O. Recruits 
New Members
The Carnegie Tech chapter of 
Alpha Phi Omega, national hon­
orary fraternity of the Boy 
Scouts of America, is opening a 
campaign to obtain fifteen new 
members during the fall term.
The local drive is part of an 
attempt to recruit 10,000 new 
members in honor of the fifteenth 
anniversary of the fraternity’s 
organization. All former scouts 
are urged to attend meetings in 
Room 229B, Industries Hall, at 
4:30 on Thursday afternoons.
APO is also planning many 
new service projects for the 
school and community, includ­
ing several which could not pre­
viously be undertaken because of 
lack of personnel during the war. 
In the past they have handled 
checking and refreshments at all­
school dances, given information 
and guidance to incoming stu­
dents, and performed service 
functions not handled by other 
campus groups.
Other plans are a stag party 
for all former scouts, a camping 
trip with students from Pitt, and 
a dance for APO members.
Officers for the present term 
are John E. Seward, president; 
Peter C. Bertelson, vice-presi­
dent; Donald F. Koenig, secre­
tary; David L. Wallace, treasurer; 
Frederick A. Sorenson, historian; 
and Howard L. Recht, alumni sec­
retary.

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, OCTOBER 29. 1946
P. & D. Profs. Represented 
At Carnegie Institute Exhibit
Three of Tech’s Painting and 
Design department faculty mem­
bers are represented in “Painting 
in the United States,” the annual 
art exhibit which will continue 
through December 8 at Carnegie 
Institute. Kermit Ewing’s “Black 
Lick,” Roy Hilton’s “My «Ivory 
Tower,” and Samuel Rosenberg’s 
“The Father” have been hung.
This year’s exhibit has aroused 
much strong comment throughout 
the East. In the main, the discus­
sion results from the fact that the 
Carnegie First Prize was award­
ed this year to Karl Knath’s ab­
stract entitled “Gear.” Two other 
sources of irritation to the staunch 
conservatives of art, “The Armor 
Must Change” by Bradley Walker 
Tomlin, and “Wind Orchestra” by 
Max Weber, won First and Fourth 
Honorable Mention, respectively. 
Only prize-winning pictures ap­
proved by the public were second 
prize winner “Welcome Home” by 
Jack Devine—a satire on brass 
hats—and the third-prize-winning
Recital To Be Held 
At Arts Center
“Don Quixote No. 1” by William 
Gropper.
The frowned-upon “Gear” is a 
beautifully constructed abstraction 
of a New England wharf. Exe­
cuted in subtle colors it presents 
a flat plane of water over which 
extends a parallel plane repre­
senting the pier, the whole broken 
up into lines characteristic of the 
abstract in the best sense of the 
word. These planes are arranged 
so that an effect of depth is mag­
nificently achieved.
The Carnegie Institute, known 
for its staid attitude toward art, 
has obviously shocked the good 
people of Pittsburgh by its choice 
of first prize. The Pittsburgh 
Press has threatened to print no 
more reproductions of Carnegie 
prizewinners until they merit it— 
and this after the faulty color and 
bad alignments of their reproduc­
tions of this year’s winners. Yet 
despite the frenzied cries that 
“modern” art has overwhelmed 
the exhibit, the total amount of 
abstract, non-objective, and sur­
realist paintings constitute only a 
small percentage of the entire col­
lection.
Homecoming
[Continued from Page 1] 
ni who died in this war. Many 
students who attended Tech be­
fore the war are expected to at­
tend the service held in honor 
of some of their classmates.
The fraternities and sororities 
intend to make this week indica­
tive of their renewed social func­
tions. The sororities are holding 
a joint open house at the Carne­
gie Union from eight to ten o’clock 
on Saturday evening, and the fra­
ternities are each having an open 
house beginning at six o’clock Fri­
day evening and a dance Satur­
day. Some fraternities will have 
special dinners on Saturday hon­
oring their alumni.
Fraternity houses will be dec­
orated Friday, further emphasiz­
ing the motif of welcome to the
alumni and the celebration of
homecoming. A committee of
three judges from the College of
Fine Arts will judge the decora­
tions and present a plaque to the 
fraternity sporting the best dec­
orations.
The highpoint of the weekend 
will be the football game Satur­
day afternoon when the Tech 
team meets the stiff competition 
of its traditional rival, Wash­
ington and Jefferson.

A New Student 
Learns of Eve. 
School Activities
Last night I stopped in to see 
Mr. McKelway for tickets to the 
play to be held at the Drama 
school. As I was leaving, Mr. Mc­
Kelway asked me if I were a new 
student at Tech’s evening school. 
When I told him this was my first 
year on campus, he immediately 
began to tell me of some of the 
many libraries open to evening stu­
dents. The main library is in 
Room 240, Industries Hall—or 
perhaps you know it as the Ad­
ministration Building. This library 
contains general ¿reference ma­
terial on all subjects. For you 
who are interested in social study, 
there is a library in Room 329 
devoted entirely to social rela­
tions. In Engineering Hall, the 
science library is located, and 
made up of reference material 
dealing with the more technical 
subjects. Don’t think for one min­
ute that the engineers have been 
forgotten, for they, too, have their 
library in Machinery Hall. All of 
these libraries are available for 
your use Monday through Friday, 
and they are open between 6:00 
and 9:00.
Mr. McKelway mentioned the 
newly decorated evening student 
study hall in Room 132 D. Indus­
tries Hall. I, having read THE 
PLAID, last week, knew all 
about this secluded spot in the old 
sheet metal wing of Industries. 
One thing that I didn’t know, 
though, was that “the last person 
to leave the room, always turns 
out the lights.”
The athletic evening students 
on campus will be interested in 
knowing that Wednesday evening 
is “our night to shine” at the 
swimming pool in the gym. And 
if you don’t swim, as is my case, 
there is no reason to worry about 
"dire happenings” for a guard is 
on duty while we’re in the pool.
Time proved inadequate as Mr. 
Kelway started to tell me about 
the scholarships available to even­
ing students, but I promised him 
that I’d be back next week to 
hear more of the advantages of 
being an evening student at Car­
negie Tech.
Tech Drama Presents 
“Time of Your Life”
There is still time to get tickets 
for Tech’s Drama School’s first 
production of the year,, “Time 
of Your Life,” by William Saroy­
an. The play will run nightly 
through November 6. Mr. McKel­
way, in Room 132A is the man 
to see for your tickets.
This play is one which deals 
with the thoughts and actions of 
various types and characters of 
people. Even though it is just a 
little bit different from most plays 
produced by the Department, it 
is sure to provide an evening of 
enjoyable entertainment. The 
Tech Drama students are noted 
for their fine productions, and the 
many former students who have 
“made their way in the field” are 
only further proof of their abil­
ity.
Come out and see these play­
ers in their embryo stage so that 
when they are famous you can 
say, “I saw them when—”
Notice to Vets
Here is a bit of news that should 
interest you veterans who have 
been troubled with problems con­
nected with school and your vet­
eran status. Mr. Abernathy, a rep­
resentative of the Veterans’ Ad­
ministration will be in Room 144, 
Industries Hall every Monday 
evening between 7:00 and 9:00. 
Mr. Abernathy is here for your 
benefit, so don’t hesitate to drop 
in and discuss your problems with 
him.
Registration 
Shows Increase
In looking over the evening 
school registration list for the 
current year, a number of inter­
esting sidelights comes into viewt 
Practically every town, borough, 
and township in Allegheny Coun­
ty is represented in the enroll­
ment. Pittsburgh, of course, tops 
the list with 613 registrants, with 
Wilkinsburg bringing up second 
place with 127. Mt. Lebanon with 
49 and Bellevue with 32 follow 
in third and fourth place. Alle­
gheny County’s total is 1306. 
Westmoreland County with 93 en- 
» rollees comes in second for Penn­
sylvania counties with Beaver, 
22; Washington, 22; Indiana, 3; 
Lawrence, 3; Greene, 1; Fayette 
1; Sharon, 1; and Somerset, 1; 
following in the order listed.
The other states in the area 
• represented are Ohio and West 
Virginia. Ohio is sporting 3 stu­
dents while 9 are carrying the 
banner for West Virginia. We 
feel that these twelve certainly 
deserve a pat on the back for the 
effort they are putting forth in 
obtaining an education.
A recap of the registration 
shows a total of 877 Engineering 
Students, 347 Fine Arts Students 
109 Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
College students, and 116 Human­
istic and Social Studies students.
Student Council
[Continued from page 2] 
tained at the Alumni Office.
Kappa Alpha Theta petitioned 
Council for a bulletin board in 
some central location. Miss Emmel 
was appointed to investigate pos­
sibility of having all sorority bul­
letin boards in Skibo.
All the Council members and 
the student body were urged to 
attend the memorial service on 
November 3, to honor the Carne­
gie men and women who died in 
service.
Mr. Farrahy was appointed to 
plan a Pep Rally for Home Com­

Here we are again this year— 
right square behind the eight-ball 
—but things is lookin’ up—got 
some new faces along with the 
old so maybe we’ll have some new 
dirt to scrape into the dustpan. 
... We wonder if Ruthie’s sud­
den switch to a sewing class has 
anything to do with those shin­
ning stars on her third finger and 
M her eyes. . . . Hear Charlie 
Haber finally got his long awaited 
cir—now he’s scarce as hen’s 
teeth. . . . The TARTAN must 
have had several cases of heart 
failure last weekend—ask Boo 
Girts what happened to the galley 
proofs . . . Those silly people 
who pushed and shoved into de­
partment store elevators during 
the strike should take note of the 
orderly and patient group in front 
of the bookstore. . . . Good for 
the girls—they managed to snag 
some of the tables in the hall of 
the Administration building which 
heretofore had been bagged by the 
too-early-td-go-to-class engineers. 
. . . Mildred Papa is back this 
year. She is expected to blossom 
forth in a lovely dress that she 
learned to make in the sewing 
class. Incidentally her sister is go­
ing to that school on Fifth Ave­
nue. Forget the name, but the 
Heinz Chapel is on the campus. 
How could she do a thing like 
that? ... It rained tonight and 
I am in a fine mood to write this 
column. . . . Just asked John­
nie V. if he had any dirt for me 
and he said, “Don’t have any dirt, 
I’m a clean boy.” Oh my, that’s 
the way I feel about that remark, 
too. Please don’t stop reading. I 
promise that nothing like that 
will ever be put in here again. 
. . . Had to stop to be introduced 
to the new members of the PLAID. 
They are men—can you blame me. 
We haven’t had so many men on 
this paper for years. . . . Perhaps

Articles Wanted 
For Technical
ATTENTION! This is a request 
for evening students to submit 
technical information to the Car­
negie Technical magazine. Any 
subject that you think would be 
of interest to the technical stu­
dents provides the basis of an ar­
ticle. Send the articles to the ma­
gazine in care of the school, or 
better still, drop out to the Car­
negie Union any Saturday between 
10:30 and 4:30 for an assignment 
on the staff of the Technical. Just 
ask for Hubert Aaronson, the edit­
or.
The latest edition of the Tech­
nical will be on sale October 30 
and 31 in Administration Hall, 1st 
Floor, front, from 7:00 to 9:00 P. M. 
You may subscribe to the Tech­
nical for $1.00 a year, in which 
case the Technical will be mailed 
to you. Or, if you prefer, you may 
purchase single issues at 20 cents.
all you people are wondering what 
happened to the handbooks this 
year. Huh! so am I. Seems as 
though everything has been de­
layed, paper, covers for the books 
and what have you. Don’t ask me 
what that means, but that is what 
I was told when I asked. Will keep 
my ears open and maybe I will 
hear more about the aforemen­
tioned books. . . . Cupid has
found himself another new cus­
tomer of late, Victor Marcy, a for­
mer Evening School student, grad­
uate of Chemical Engineering, has 
been making preparations to be 
wed on October 30. The couple 
will tour Virginia, Maryland, New 
York then back to Pittsburgh 
where “Vic” will resume work as 
a Research Chemist at Hall Lab­
oratories, Inc. . . . We have been 
hearing quite a few complimenta­
ry remarks about Dr. Watson, the 
Psychology instructor, that is. He 
is well liked by the people in his 
class. . . . Something new at
Tech—a certain German professor
Do You Know Tha—
The Colfax Power jplant of the 
Duquesne Light Company uses 
about one-fourth of the water of 
Allegheny River for cooling pur­
poses in condensing steam from 
their boilers.
Good old fashioned mud is used 
in the drilling of oil wells in Tex­
as and California. Over $100,000 
in mud costs have been spent on 
certain wells drilled.
Boilers used for the produc­
tion of steam at West Penn Power 
are as tall as an eleven story 
building.
Light bulbs, you know — the 
common variety, are made at the 
rate of about 700 per minute on 
a machine employed at the Corn­
ing Glass Works.
Our genial president states that 
he saw a man shocked with 200,- 
000 volts from a surge generator 
and still lived to tell about it.
Glass is not a solid as most 
people think, but a super-cooled 
liquid.
The three most popular maga­
zines sold in the U. S. are Life, 
the Post and Colliers. Life sold 
22,000,000 copies last year alone.

ing facilities, absence of hot water, 
temperamental plumbing, lack of 
equipment, smoke, and mud were 
among the more serious com­
plaints.
Already many of these situa­
tions have been rectified and the 
rest of them are on the agenda.
The plumbing problem was one 
of the first to be corrected and 
with the turning on of the hot 
water and heat, two other serious 
conditions were eradicated. For

Spending the years 1929-1942 
in Japan, he engaged in student 
and rural mission work in varied 
districts, taught at Meiji College 
and Japan Theological Seminary, 
was chairman of the executive 
committee of the Presbyterian 
mission in Japan, and acted as 
pastor of the Tokyo Union church.
After imprisonment from De­
cember, 1941, to June, 1942, he 
was repatriated on the Gripsholm. 
He then served as assistant pastor 
at the Third Presbyterian Church 
in Pittsburgh. In the summer of 
1944 he came to the Mt. Lebanon 
United Presbyterian Church as 
pastor.
In addition to his work there, 
Dr. Smith is Vice-President of the 
Council of Churches in Pittsburgh, 
a member of the Board of Direct­
ors of the American Service Insti­
tute, and a member of the Men’s 
Committee of the Family Society.
Aiding Dr. Smith in next Tues­
day’s program will be the Chapel 
Choir under the direction of 
Charles Tritle, a student in the 
music department. Joan Bailey, 
another music student, will be the 
organist.
The Chapel service as a school 
activity was instituted in 1921 by 
the Young Men’s Christian Asso­
ciation on campus. At that time 
there was no scheduled hour for 
it, but after a few years it was 
scheduled at every other Tuesday 
at 11:30 as a regular Institute af­
fair. Every student has this hour 
free so that he may attend Chapel 
and assemblies.

The smoke, a temporary hazard 
caused by the burning of coal, 
will also be cleared up when the 
gas is connected and plans are
under way for filling the mud hole 
and for buying shower room 
benches.
Even with such improvements 
no one will argue that these tem­
porary facilities are dream homes.
No one should have expected them 
to be.
FPHA is the answer to an 
emergency and should be recog­
nized as such.
It is true that converted bar­
racks will never compete with the 
dorms for comfort, but it is equally 
true that as temporary quarters, 
they are decidedly better than the 
benches in Schenley park.
