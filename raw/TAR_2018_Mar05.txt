Pittsburgh public schools avoid strike
20 transformative years of Academic Development at CMU
Forum discusses the limits of free speech
ADAM TUNNARD
Staffwriter 
Pittsburghers from 
Southside to East Liberty 
were held in suspense this 
week by the potential of 
a district-wide teacher’s 
strike, set to begin March 
2, this past Friday. How-
ever, in a move that has 
been advantageous to all 
parties, the strike has been 
avoided and schools will 
remain open and function-
ing for the time being.
As of earlier last week, 
the Pittsburgh Federation 
of Teachers, a teacher’s 
union, and the Pittsburgh 
School District were un-
able to reach a new con-
tractual agreement, and 
a strike appeared to be 
imminent. But, after ex-
tensive debate, a tenta-
tive agreement has been 
reached.
If a strike were to have 
occurred, 25,000 students 
across 54 district schools 
wouldn’t have been able to 
go to class. Around 3,000 
total teachers, parapro-
fessionals, police of?cers, 
and other school faculty 
are union members, so 
a strike would have left 
the entire district without 
proper schooling.
Nina Esposito-Visgitis, 
the president of the 
Pittsburgh Federation 
of Teachers, told the 
Pittsburgh Tribune-Re-
view that negotiations to 
prevent this took “14 hours 
straight” but that she is 
“happy that we were able 
to [reach an agreement] 
for our educators and our 
parents and our students.”
Esposito-Visgitis, the 
rest of the Pittsburgh 
Federation of Teachers 
executive board, and the 
board of the Pittsburgh 
School District may have 
spent countless hours 
reaching this accord, but 
the overall strife has been 
going on for far longer 
than just this past week’s 
debate. Discussions relat-
ed to this con?ict began in 
Aug. 2016, when the union 
and district barely reached 
an agreement to extend 
their contracts, citing dis-
agreements on Pennsylva-
nia’s education budget.
Later, on Oct. 19, 2017, 
grievances over teacher’s 
scheduling, over?lled 
classes, and pay for early 
childhood teachers, were 
formally presented to dis-
trict representatives. Dis-
cussions continued, with

As the topic of the right 
to freedom of speech contin-
ues to become increasingly 
controversial across the na-
tion, former and current 
members of the Carnegie 
Mellon community gath-
ered to discuss the campus 
policy at the Campus De-
liberative Forum (CDF) on 
Free Speech, Inclusion, and 
Democracy co-hosted this 
past Saturday by the Center 
for Student Diversity and 
Inclusion and the Program 
for Deliberative Democracy. 
The discussion was com-
prised of several ?ve-person 
focus groups with a panel 
discussion session toward 
the end of the conference.
The discussions start-
ed off with a conversa-
tion on what is de?ned 
as free speech. “We can’t 
have free speech without 
people abusing it. Where 
is the place we draw the 
line? What is considered 
racist? What is considered 
xenophobic?” said Richard 
Hoffberg, a junior majoring 
in Mechanical Engineering. 
Other focus groups dis-
cussed similar concepts. 
The general consensus 
seemed to be that, if there 
was a controversial topic or 
speaker, there needed to be 
discussion amongst people 
of all perspectives.
Another key topic that 
was introduced was the 
problem of undergradu-
ate political apathy. An 
anonymous contributor 
claimed that “students don’t 
care about important topics 
unless they personally im-
pact them or everyone is 
talking about them.”

Academic Development 
started in the summer of 
1997 and consisted of only 
one full time employee and 
one graduate student. To-
day, it reaches thousands 
of students each year, and 
employs more than 200 
students, in addition to 
the ?ve full-time employ-
ees that keep Academic 
Development running. 
In honor of Academic 
Development’s 20th an-
niversary, The Tartan sat 
down with four of its full 
time employees in order 
to discuss how Academic 
Development has changed, 
the services that they pro-
vide the student body, and 
where they think Academic 
Development will grow 
from here.
These four employees 
were the director of 
Academic Development 
Linda Hooper, who was 
the founding full time em-
ployee, John Lanyon, the 
Peer Tutor Program Coor-
dinator, Jessica Owens, the 
Supplemental Instruction 
(SI) and EXCEL Program 
Coordinator, and Mike Pol-
jak, the Academic Coaching 
Program Coordinator. The 
?fth and ?nal full time em-
ployee was Administrative 
Assistant Donora Craig-
head.
Academic Development 
was originally located in 
the Student Center, a navy 
building that was located 
where the Gates Hillman 
Complex currently stands. 
Director Linda Hooper de-
scribed it as “basically a 
long trailer.” She, with a 
graduate student acting as 
her assistant, worked out 
of a mail room while all 
other tutoring happened 
in the room next to them. 
“I’d be working with a stu-
dent, and they’d be crying 
about something, we would 
be dealing with a sensitive 
subject, and all these stu-
dents would be coming to 
get their mail,” said Hooper 
of the situation.
Academic Development 
is currently located in 
Cyert Hall, a far cry from 
their original home in the 
Student Center, with of?ces 
for the Program Directors 
and rooms for peer tutors 
and academic coaches to 
meet with the students they 
are helping out. And this 
change in space has come 
with a drastic increase in 
the services Academic De-
velopment offers. “Because 
we have adapted to student 
need, every single year we 
have had growth in all of 
our programs almost across 
the board,” Hooper said.
This growth can be 
seen very starkly in the 
statistics of the programs. 
Walk-in tutoring supported 
15 subjects in two loca-
tions, Donner House and 
Mudge House, in 2003. 
This past year, 33 subjects 
had walk-in tutoring ses-
sions in seven locations. 
EXCEL groups supported 27 
courses last year, compared 
to 11 courses in the 2007-
2008 academic year. Poljak 
was hired two and a half 
years ago as the ?rst full 
time employee in his posi-
tion as Academic Coach-
ing Program Director, and 
last year 77 percent of all 
students enrolled in SI sup-
ported courses attended SI 
sessions, according to the 
annual report.
Poljak said he is often 
asked why there is such 
a clear enthusiasm for 
Academic Development’s 
services at Carnegie Mel-
lon, given that the students 
are ones who presumably 
are capable and intelligent. 
He suggests that Academic 
Development’s growth 
stems from the fact that 
students are so academi-
cally successful, “Your in-
telligence is making you say 
I need to gobble up all that 
support... and it’s our job to 
make sure it’s readily avail-
able.”
The staff of Academic 
Development gives a lot of 
credit to their more than 
200 student employees as 
well. Owens, SI and EX-
CEL Program Coordina-
tor, found that the student 
employees are what “keep 
[her] going.” She highlight-
ed that student employees 
“maintain their own aca-
demics, and they work re-
ally really hard to help the 
people around them. They 
have that unique experi-
ence where they can actu-
ally share that experience 
with students and inter-
pret things in a way that is 
meaningful, really connect-
ing with the student’s ques-
tions.”
Lanyon, Peer Tutor 
Program Coordinator, 
stressed that not only do 
student employees ben-
e?t from working with 
Academic Development, 
the full time employees 
bene?t from working with 
the student employees and 
use their input to shape the 
programs. He states that 
when people frequently ask 
him if he is tired of his job 
after the sixteen years he 
has spent working here,“I 
have to laugh when I hear 
that question because the 
answer is an emphatic no... 
what other job can you have 
where you can interact with 
so many different people 
coming from so many 
different cultural back-
grounds, so many different 
educational backgrounds, 
so many socio-economic 
backgrounds?”
The student employ-
ees juggle heavy work-
loads, balancing classwork 
and their Academic 
Development jobs, but the 
full-time employees more 
than match that work ethic 
and enthusiasm for learn-
ing. Hooper said of her pro-
gram coordinators, “These 
three people work harder 
than anyone you have seen 
on this campus.” Poljak 
quipped that sometimes he 
thinks that there are “two 
Donoras” because of the 
massive amount of work 
Administrative Assistant 
Donora Craighead handles 
each week.
The Tartan asked the 
four employees what their 
aspirations for the next 20 
years of Academic Devel-
opment are. Hooper stated 
that her goal for the expan-
sion of Academic Develop-
ment would be to hire more 
personnel to expand on the 
work that the current staff 
is completing. Owens lit up 
at the prompt, con?ding 
that her aspiration is that 
Academic Development 
owns its place as the pro-
gram that teaches students 
how to learn. Poljak talked 
about expanding the ser-
vices they offer to graduate 
students. John Lanyon said 
that, given that they had 
the resources to do so, he 
would like it if they would 
“strategically expand our 
programs into other col-
leges and majors” as a lot 
of the tutoring is currently 
aimed at the math and sci-
ence courses that have 
higher drop rates.
Though 20 is undoubt-
edly a signi?cant anniver-
sary for any group on cam-
pus, and surely signals that 
Academic Development 
is here to stay, they found 
themselves unable to cel-
ebrate so far this year. 
Though they had planned 
to do something to com-
memorate this occasion at 
the beginning of the year, 
Hooper explained, “We 
were too busy!”

Special to The Tartan
The Undergraduate 
Student Senate’s Internal 
Development committee 
has been focusing on the 
different ways we can give 
back to our Senators and 
show them that the work 
they do is valued. One of 
the ways we decided on 
was to create a Senator 
Spotlight.
The Senator Spotlight 
allows us to recognize 
Senators every two weeks 
for the various in?uential 
activities and initiatives 
they have completed. These 
Senators are brought up to 
the front of our general 
meetings and are given the 
recognition for the work 
they’ve done on behalf of 
the Senate. 
Two of the senators 
being recognized this spot-
light are Alexandra Moy 
and Benjamin Johnson-
Staub.
Moy has been 
recognized for the con-
stant work she put in to 
the Campus Life commit-
tee, as well as the efforts 
made weekly to engage the 
student body by tabling for 
hours every Friday after-
noon in the Cohon Center.
Johnson-Staub has also 
been recognized for this 
week’s Senator Spotlight. 
He is a dedicated member 
to the Senate and is respon-
sible for the conversation 
with the administration 
regarding the add/drop 
deadline. You can contact 
them at acmoy@andrew.
cmu.edu and benjamij@an-
drew.cmu.edu, respectively.
To personally get 
involved in Senate you 
can visit our general 
body meetings every 
Thursday at 5 p.m. in the 
Cohon Center Danforth 
Conference Room. During 
the ?rst few minutes of ev-
ery meeting, we allow for 
audience participation in 
which you can voice your 
concerns directly to your 
representatives. Senate is 
designed to support the 
students and to constantly 
work towards making the 
undergraduate experience 
a better one. We work hand 
in hand with various groups 
on campus to ensure the 
creation of a uni?ed and 
collaborative campus.

March 5, 2018 « The Tartan                                                                                                                                             thetartan.org/news » A3   
even a district-bourne 
contract being present-
ed to the union, which 
was promptly vetoed 
by the teachers almost 
unanimously.
The agreement reached 
this past week clearly 
comes after long-standing 
disputes, but shows how 
important it was to both 
sides to prevent a strike. 
Esposito-Visgitis told 
WTAE Pittsburgh Action 
News, prior to the strike’s 
cancellation, that “our 
teachers want to stay in the 
classroom with their stu-
dents, where they belong.”
Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto urged both sides to 
reach a consensus earlier 
in the week, stressing the 
gravity of the situation in 
saying, “When you’re in a 
situation like this, it affects 
the people, the students, 
their parents, and it’s go-
ing to have a devastating 
effect upon the city.”
The last time teachers 
held a strike in Pittsburgh 
was the infamous Dec. 
1975 to Jan. 1976 strike, 
in which schools closed for 
two months while intense 
negotiations over pay 
raise, class size, student 
discipline, scheduling, and 
job security were carried 
out.
This story made 
national news at the time 
and prevented 62,300 stu-
dents at 105 schools from 
going to school. Had the 
Pittsburgh Federation of 
Teachers indeed held a 
strike this year, there’s no 
telling whether the situ-
ations would have been 
similar or not. Luckily, 
both the union and the dis-
trict wanted the best for 
the community and were 
able to keep schools in 
operation.
While strikes are 
necessary tools of collec-
tive bargaining rights, the 
entire community, teach-
ers and students alike, are 
likely grateful that the sit-
uation did not have to oc-
cur. Pittsburgh schools are 
to remain open, and while 
neither the Pittsburgh 
Federation of Teachers 
or the Pittsburgh School 
District offered any de-
tails relating to their ?nal 
contract, one can assume 
some degree of mutual 
bene?t, and hope for its 
longevity.
Though the purpose of 
the forum was not to create 
solutions, many thought 
that requiring a basic civ-
ics course would alleviate 
some of the problems re-
garding participation. 
With over 20 percent 
of the student body with 
homes overseas, an intro-
ductory civics course en-
tering the university would 
allow for a more diverse 
array of participants in 
student government and 
activism. In regards to in-
ternational students, an 
anonymous graduate stu-
dent explained that there 
are “different mechanisms 
for different groups, [for 
instance] Asian students 
are taught to stay obedient 
and not challenge loudly.”
The discussions became 
increasingly profound and 
intense. When it came time 
for discussion with the ad-
ministrative panel, howev-
er, the conversations with 
detailed analysis came to 
a grinding halt. Though it 
is the role of the adminis-
trative representative to 
remain a neutral represen-
tative of the university and 
its interests, it was difficult 
for that role to manifest 
in a forum where position 
taking was necessary.
Dan Munsch, Assis-
tant General Counsel at 
Carnegie Mellon, explained 
that “the right to speech 
is very broad. We are a 
private institution, we do 
not have to defend the first 
amendment, but we choose 
to.” Holly Hippensteel, As-
sociate Vice President for 
Community Standards and 
Diversity Initiatives, when 
asked about the criteria for 
protected free speech, said 
that there is no “opera-
tional definition of creative 
inquiry. As we think about 
it, there has to be a mix of 
of intellectual and creative 
expression.”
And, if there was to be a 
highly controversial and di-
visive speaker, what would 
the university do if there 
were students who felt un-
safe? Dean of Students and 
Vice President for Student 
Affairs Gina Casalegno 
stated that students would 
naturally mobilize and 
get ready for the pro-
cess of engagement. She 
evidenced the Westboro 
Baptist’s cameo on campus 
as a source for inspiration. 
“There were students who 
sang the hate away and 
also students who didn’t 
feel safe in the environ-
ment, so the university set 
up an event in the center 
for diversity.”
At the conference’s 
conclusion, the campus 
policy remained as vague 
as when it was first penned. 
But, the most important re-
sult of the conference most 
definitely was the engage-
ments the participants 
could then spread to other 
students and faculty on 
campus.
VALENE MEZMIN
Editor-in-Chief 
Over spring break, 
a group of 13 Carnegie 
Mellon University stu-
dents and a student from 
the Community College 
of Allegheny County, rep-
resenting the Homewood 
Children’s Village, will 
travel to Puerto Rico to 
take part in an Alternative 
Spring Break program. The 
10-day trip, from March 9 
to March 18, will be spent 
helping local farmers re-
build and plant crops and 
meeting with government 
officials and local commu-
nity leaders to learn about 
ways locals have struggled 
to survive after the disas-
trous effects of Hurricane 
Maria.
The trip is being led by 
Tiffany Taulton, a gradu-
ate student at Carnegie 
Mellon’s Heinz College of 
Information Systems and 
Public Policy, Caroline 
Morin, a senior Chemical 
and Biomedical Engineer-
ing double-major, and 
Sterling Wells, a junior ma-
joring in Decision Science.
Having spent her early 
childhood in Puerto Rico, 
Taulton was heartbroken 
to read about the dam-
age caused by Hurricane 
Maria and knew that she 
needed to help. Last year, 
Taulton was one of many 
students to support Rosa-
na Guernica, a junior De-
cision Science major, on 
her trip to deliver hospital 
supplies to the island and 
evacuate critical care pa-
tients. “It was an exciting 
moment to fly over Puerto 
Rico after such a long ab-
sence,” she says, reflect-
ing on what it was like 
to revisit her childhood 
home. “The landscape of 
San Juan had changed a 
lot. And, it was shocking 
to see how many roofs 
were covered in sky blue 
tarp. I knew instinctively 
that the situation in the 
countryside would be even 
worse.”
Before traveling with 
Guernica, Taulton was 
planning to make a trip her-
self to the island, but put 
that on hold to help with 
that mission. However, 
because of her experience 
accompanying Guernica, 
she felt that she wanted 
to sustain the impact that 
the trip had on the island. 
“I began to think of how 
students from the College 
of Engineering, Tepper, 
and even those studying 
healthcare and psychology 
could learn from the trip.”
The Alternative Spring 
Break program is mod-
eled after a similar trip 
that she participated in 
as an undergraduate at 
Georgetown University. 
“That trip focused on bor-
der relations between the 
U.S. and Mexico, and had 
a profound impact on my 
life — both in terms of my 
worldview and my career 
trajectory,” says Taulton. 
“I knew that students at 
Heinz could benefit from 
a similar experience, and 
that Puerto Rico could 
greatly benefit from hav-
ing future government 
leaders that had formed a 
personal relationship with 
the island. Even if students 
never returned to Puerto 
Rico, or worked with the 
federal government on 
that level, they would ben-
efit from the experience 
of understanding how cli-
mate change affects com-
munities, and they would 
leave the trip with a better 
idea of both how to prevent 
and mitigate that suffer-
ing through good disaster 
management and climate 
resilient planning.”
Taulton eventually 
joined forces with Morin 
and Wells, who both also 
helped Guernica raise 
funds for her trip, and 
expressed interest in 
Taulton’s plan to conduct 
a longer mission on the 
island.
“After two months of 
struggling to connect with 
farmers by phone and on 
Facebook, and thinking 
about how difficult my sec-
ond semester classes were 
expected to be, I was ready 
to give up,” says Taulton. 
“But, Caroline and Sterling 
both contacted me, asking 
if I was still going to do it 
and then volunteered to 
help me get it done. I told 
them that I would work 
with them for a week to 
see what we could get 
done, but if we couldn’t get 
the farm location settled, 
that would be the end of 
it. As luck would have it, 
phone calls and Facebook 
messages started going 
through and we were able 
to get the basic plan fin-
ished in that week!”
The trip will be spent 
helping Puerto Rican farm-
ers plant crops and clean 
up their fields as well as 
helping the Puerto Rican 
economy by purchasing 
tours, project supplies, and 
lodging from local busi-
nesses that are struggling, 
as well as donating to orga-
nizations that they will be 
visiting to learn about their 
work.
“We have four foci 
for the tours: agroecol-
ogy, solar power, land 
trusts and cooperatives,” 
says Taulton. “Basically, 
food and power, and 
how communities can 
help themselves in the 
absence of government 
assistance. We will also 
have one student from 
the Homewood Children’s 
Village accompanying 
us to see how these les-
sons can be applied to 
Homewood for people-cen-
tered, resilient, community 
development.”
Taulton hopes the trip 
will prepare students to 
serve the public in the 
fields of health policy, food 
policy, urban planning, and 
climate resilience, bring to-
gether the engineering and 
sustainability-focused pro-
grams of Carnegie Mellon 
University with those at 
the University of Puerto 
Rico at Mayagüez and 
make sure that future gov-
ernment leaders in the U.S. 
mainland understand the 
effects that their health-
care, budget, and trade 
decisions can have on U.S. 
overseas territories.
Taulton finds that her 
biggest challenge may be 
dealing with unexpected 
obstacles, like power out-
ages or water rationing. 
She stated, “I’m not wor-
ried, however, because 
the Puerto Rican people 
are extremely hospitable, 
and we have been virtu-
ally adopted by the faculty 
of the University of Puerto 
Rico. They have arranged 
housing, transportation, 
and even tours for us for 
several days of our trip.”
Although many 
Carnegie Mellon depart-
ments, donation drives, 
and outside sources have 
provided funding for the 
trip thus far, Taulton and 
her team still encourage 
anyone who is interested 
in helping their mission to 
donate to their fundraiser 
on YouCaring. They will 
also post pictures from 
the trip on their Facebook 
page.
“Please help us to make 
a lasting impact during 
our trip by giving your 
financial support today 
and sharing our campaign 
widely!”

The solution to America’s 
gun problem does not lie with 
teachers. Rather, it is the 
responsibility of policymakers 
to implement effective school 
safety measures. It is incred-
ibly shortsighted to think that 
distributing more guns within 
schools will reduce the number 
of school shootings. Suggesting 
that teachers should be armed 
with guns reflects an avoid-
ance of the real question of why 
school shootings are even able 
to happen in the first place and 
why they have been happening 
so frequently in the past few 
years. 
On Feb. 24, President Trump 
tweeted, “Armed Educators 
(and trusted people who work 
within a school) love our stu-
dents and will protect them. 
Very smart people. Must be fire-
arms adept & have annual train-
ing. Should get yearly bonus. 
Shootings will not happen again 
— a big [and] very inexpen-
sive deterrent. Up to States.” If 
Trump’s proposal was taken lit-
erally, that would mean giving 
guns to about 718,000 teachers, 
which is almost the size of the 
army and navy combined. 
According to Debra 
Ciamacca’s TIME article, 
Trump’s proposal is a “quick 
and cheap solution to a diffi-
cult and expensive problem” for 
many reasons. Teachers are not 
trained to wield a weapon, and 
it most certainly is not in their 
job description. While teachers 
should protect their students 
by following standard safety 
protocol during a crisis, they 
are not responsible for shooting 
the attacker. That’s the police 
department’s job.
Ciamacca mentions that 
even police officers have a dif-
ficult time “reacting to threats 
and properly executing the use 
of deadly force.” According 
to The New York Times, even 
trained police officers only 
hit their targets one-third of 
the time. During actual gun-
fights, their accuracy can be 
as low as 13 percent. So, how 
can teachers be expected to ac-
curately wield a gun in high-
stress situations like a school 
shooting? Instead of proposing 
that teachers should be trained 
to use a weapon, why not hire 
more police officers to protect 
students and spend more mon-
ey on improving building safety 
measures? 
Additionally, teachers work 
in such close proximity with 
students that an incident with 
accidental discharge is almost 
guaranteed. Students and par-
ents cannot be sure that the 
gun is securely locked away and 
completely inaccessible to stu-
dents. They will live with con-
stant uncertainty and “what ifs” 
due to the fear of the gun get-
ting into the wrong hands. 
If a teacher owns a gun in 
the classroom, that also stands 
in the way of a positive teacher-
student relationship. Teachers 
are mentors, advisors, guides, 
and confidants. The classroom 
is supposed to be a safe place. 
Students’ knowledge that their 
teacher owns a gun can paint 
an antagonistic picture of 
the teacher. Guns say “stand 
back”,rather than “stand up.” 
They will make students feel 
less safe around their teachers, 
and thus are not conducive to 
the teacher-student relation-
ship. 
The most important ques-
tion that Trump failed to con-
sider before his thoughtless 
proposal to arm teachers is: 
How would the guns (and 
training) be paid for? Trump 
proposed slashing five billion 
dollars from the Department 
of Education, and programs to 
pay for school counselors and 
violence prevention would be 
the first to go. In order to fund 
guns and training, he would 
have to increase the budget he 
so ardently wants to slash. The 
whole idea is ridiculous. Teach-
ers don’t ask for much; they 
just want to be paid fairly and 
to have enough supplies in their 
classroom to educate their stu-
dents effectively without pay-
ing for it themselves. It would 
be so much more helpful to in-
crease funding for school sup-
plies and mental health aware-
ness programs than for guns. It 
is shameful that this needs to be 
spelled out for the President. 
Such a ludicrous proposition 
as arming teachers with guns 
lends itself to so many ethical 
and legislative questions. 
Who would be responsible if 
a teacher missed and shot the 
wrong person? What if a stu-
dent gained access to the weap-
on? What if a teacher refused 
to wield the weapon? Do they 
have a choice? Should they be 
paid more due to this additional 
responsibility? The list goes on.
It’s common sense. You can’t 
fight fire with fire. That’s just 
not how it works. In order to 
eliminate school shootings, you 
cannot add more guns. Rather, 
we need to have stricter gun 
laws, and perhaps even am-
munition control. Research 
shows that gun availability in-
creased “the rates of several 
violent crimes in a sample of 
cities across 39 countries.” Fur-
ther research revealed that the 
number of guns per capita per 
country is a strong predictor 
of firearm-related deaths. The 
U.S. is late in realizing that gun 
availability is the problem. It 
took several school shootings 
for this issue to even bubble to 
the surface. And our President 
still doesn’t believe it. In com-
parison to other countries, the 
U.S. is quite archaic in its gun 
control policies. In Australia for 
example, only 14 percent of ho-
micides are committed by fire-
arms, compared to 60 percent 
in the U.S. The U.S. gun owner-
ship rate is more than five times 
the Australian rate. The statis-
tics don’t lie. It is astounding 
that we aren’t already scram-
bling to revise our policies. 
Let’s reframe the way we 
have this debate. As Ciamacca 
wrote, “Let’s not talk about 
school shootings in terms of 
gun control and mental health. 
Let’s talk about school safety.” 
She’s right. There’s no time to 
wait for stricter gun control pol-
icies or a reasonable President. 
The best course of action for 
students, parents, and teachers 
is one of prevention. We need 
metal detectors, panic buttons, 
security cameras, and doors and 
windows that can be secured in 
the case of a school shooter. 
We need trained police officers 
who can protect students while 
they learn and teachers while 
they educate. We don’t need 
more guns. 
  The Parkland, FL shooter had a his-
tory of violent behavior. Police were 
called to his house many times, but 
they did not arrest him because the 
school board had an agreement 
with the police not to arrest any 
students. The FBI received a viable 
tip indicating he wanted to shoot up 
a school, but the lead was not pur-
sued.
The following are incredible:  A 
student saw the shooter in a stair-
way loading his ri?e, but did nothing 
to try to stop him when told “things 
are going to get messy around here.” 
The student left the building, did 
not call 911, but informed a teacher. 
The teacher drove the student to a 
baseball ?eld, and then went back 
to the school to check it out, but 
the shooting had started. Why did 
the armed deputy sheriff assigned 
to protect the school stand around 
during the shooting? If true, why 
did three police of?cers arrive at the 
school and take cover behind their 
vehicles, and not enter the school?
Arming teachers who are not 
trained to be police of?cers could be 
disastrous. What happens when a 
police of?cer enters a school during 
a shooting and encounters a teacher 
with a gun?
We should increase the age 
to purchase a ?rearm to 21. Most 
school shooters are under 21. We 
have to improve the background 
check system. Schools need to lock 
all entrances, and install shatter 
proof glass and alarms. A heavily 
armed security guard should be sta-
tioned in every school.

Pennsylvania State University, Class 
of 1963
LETTER TO THE EDITOR: SHOOTINGS ARE PREVENTABLE
LETTER TO THE EDITOR: TRUMP POSING AS CONSERVATIVE
The biggest faker of all is none 
other than President Donald 
Trump.  He is posing as a “conser-
vative,” but he is actually a fake-
conservative. What is my evidence?
You can look this up for yourself 
on the internet.
In 1999, he proposed that the 
Congress pass a new “National 
Wealth Tax” (income) of 14.25 per-
cent on all individuals who have 
a “net-worth” of $10 million and 
higher.  That is a very “liberal” idea. 
There is not even one Democrat in 
both houses of the Congress who 
supports such a very liberal/pro-
gressive policy like that. The Green 
Party does.  Trump wanted the 
money generated by it to be spent 
on two items:
1. Totally eliminating the 
national debt (that sounds 
“conservative”).
2. Spending the remainder on 
adding it to the Social Security 
Trust Fund to make it more fully sol-
vent for additional years (that does 
not sound “conservative.”)
I am assuming that some of 
us know that it is presently fully 
solvent through the year 2034, 
meaning that there is absolutely 
no reason for conservatives to want 
to cut bene?ts right now (as they 
yearn and crave to do). The less-
than-truthful conservatives in the 
Congress and the right-wing pro-
poganda media machine does not 
want the public to know this.
President Trump has been pos-
ing as a “conservative.”  He has been 
masterfully manipulating all of us 
and playing us for fools and suckers, 
both his supporters and his critics.

It’s that time of the year: mid-
term after midterm, essay after 
essay, project after project. Even 
though spring break is days away, it 
feels like it will never arrive. We’re 
drained, but assignments aren’t go-
ing to ?nish themselves. How do we 
stop from burning out?
Let me ?rst explain what burn-
ing out is. It’s that week in the 
semester when you feel so over-
whelmed that all you want to do is 
stay in bed and eat ice cream while 
watching Net?ix. For me, it’s that 
time when I’m in bed, eating ice 
cream, and watching bad reality 
television, when I brie?y wonder 
whether college is worth it. Don’t 
worry: I always circle around back.
There are many factors that con-
tribute to burning out. First, the 
most obvious, is the pile of work 
that’s dumped on us from all our 
classes. In the beginning of the se-
mester, I heard from professors that 
they “understand you’re busy with 
all your classes,” but they still went 
ahead and scheduled everything 
the week before mid-semester. 
While I understand the wish to 
get exams in before spring break, 
it feels like I’m falling down a con-
stant chute that never ends.
Another factor is the search for 
and planning of summer excur-
sions. While this is more concen-
trated among upperclassmen look-
ing for internships, underclassmen 
also experience this. For me, as 
I search for an internship for the 
summer, it’s hard not to compare 
myself to my friends who locked 
down an internship in the fall with 
Google and Microsoft or some other 
industry giant.
This speaks to an overarching 
factor that also contributed to burn-
ing out: stress. Our age bracket — 
18 to 29 — experiences stress the 
most often, with 87 percent of the 
group responding they are some-
times or often stressed.
In recent years, “stress culture” 
has been highlighted as an issue at 
universities, especially at Carnegie 
Mellon. A 2013 study by the Carne-
gie Mellon Community Think Tank 
analyzed the different scenarios 
different students face. The study 
gives several recommendations of 
where students can ask for help: 
Academic Development, Counsel-
ing and Psychological Services 
(CaPS), and the Global Communi-
cation Center. However, many stu-
dents don’t want to ask for help, or 
feel that they have to ?ght through 
everything on their own. Everyone 
seems to be stressed out, sleep de-
prived, and carrying on like a zom-
bie, that sometimes when I’m not, 
I feel bad. How ironic: feeling bad 
about not feeling bad.
The most detrimental part of 
stress culture is this inherent need 
for students to want to one-up each 
other by how much they’re strug-
gling. Among my friends and just 
around campus, I’ve heard things 
like, “I had four hours of sleep!” fol-
lowed by, “Well, I got three!” Or per-
haps, “I have three midterms and a 
group project in two days!” and its 
response: “I have ?ve midterms and 
three group projects!”
I can’t say I’m innocent in this. 
I’ve done it. We feel good about 
ourselves if we’re suffering more. 
And when we do prevail and get 
the work done (which we do, but 
maybe on no sleep whatsoever), we 
feel even better.
All these things add up to burn-
ing out. Let’s return to the main 
question: How do we stop from 
burning out? Or how do we over-
come burning out?
There’s no one set path, but 
the most important thing that 
has helped me is to make time for 
yourself. Yes, you have to get things 
done, but you can’t get those things 
done if your brain isn’t rested or 
relaxed. Have a cheat day — not 
just for food, but for everything. Go 
shopping (or window shopping). 
Stay in bed as long as you can. 
See a movie, binge that televi-
sion show you’ve been meaning 
to watch. If you can’t spare a 
whole day, do something small. 
Grab a meal at a place you’ve been 
meaning to try. Buy a pint of Ben 
& Jerry’s. Limit yourself and only 
watch one or two episodes of that 
television show. Essentially, go 
treat yourself. Taking your mind off 
all the work will do some good.
Know when to 
say no. This is es-
pecially impor-
tant if you’re 
part of a 
club or or-
ganization. 
Know your 
schedule 
so you 
know 
if you 
can take 
certain 
responsibilities any given day or 
week. For me, I’m an editor for The 
Tartan, but I also enjoy writing arti-
cles, like this one, for other sections 
across the paper. But some weeks, 
when editors ask if I can write an 
article, I need to know my schedule 
that week so I know if I can say yes. 
Sometimes I can’t, and I need to 
say no. It has come back to bite me 
when I don’t say no.
And ?nally, don’t be afraid to 
ask for help. Professors do schedule 
things all around the same time, 
but they do understand that you’re 
busy and overwhelmed. Check a 
week or two ahead to be sure of 
deadlines, and ask your professor 
for an extension if you know you 
can’t physically do all the work as 
assigned. Unfortunately, 
this doesn’t help 
with midterm 
exams, but it 
underlines 
something 
I’ve been 
repeating: 
know your 
schedule. 
It will save 
your life.
Burning 
out is part 
of being a 
student. It’s 
universal, 
but it’s also 
something we 
should try our 
best to avoid. 
Good luck — 
there’s one 
more week to 
go!
Labeling grammar policing as discriminatory is a stretch

Learning a language is dif?cult 
for anybody, especially learning 
one as complex as English. There-
fore, it comes as no surprise that 
people make mistakes when writ-
ing, especially in a setting so fast-
paced as social media. Sometimes 
spellcheck and autocorrect let us 
down. Other times, we might mess 
up on syntax. Regardless of the 
error, mistakes happen and most 
people are aware of that.
But what about pointing out 
grammatical errors as part of an 
argument?
On Twitter, a writer known as 
Your Fat Friend tweeted: “Remind-
er: unsolicited grammar policing 
disproportionately targets people 
with disabilities, poor folks, immi-
grants and people of color. If you 
can’t understand what someone is 
saying, ask clarifying questions. If 
you can, there’s no need to correct 
their grammar.”
To be fair, “grammar policing,” 
or notoriously pointing out gram-
mar errors where irrelevant, is 
not a good tactic for a multitude 
of reasons. Grammar policing 
causes one to inadvertently 
state that proper spelling 
and grammar is more 
important than the 
actual topic at hand. 
In the time and 
character space 
spent on pointing 
out grammar, you 
could state your 
opinion and open 
up the discussion. 
Perhaps you might 
share an article sup-
porting your argu-
ment. You could even 
scroll past the post and 
move on with your day. With 
all of these options open, there 
really appears to be no reason 
for one to needlessly point out 
an error.
To give an example of gram-
mar policing in action, consider 
the following scenario: you saw 
a post pertaining to gun control 
that you disagree with. This 
post has several grammar errors 
scattered throughout, but you 
can still comprehend the main 
message and supporting argu-
ments. You then type something 
along the lines of “you used the 
wrong ‘they’re’/‘there’/‘their.’” 
By pointing out this error that 
does not detract meaning from 
the message of the post, you pos-
sibly make yourself look elitist 
for boasting your ability to spell. 
Regardless of the content that fol-
lows, you still leave that ?rst im-
pression and inadvertently state 
that you care more about spelling 
and grammar than you do about 
the topic at hand. In the time and 
character space that you took to 
type your comment, you could 
have provided a link to a source 
that backs up your argument or 
challenges the post’s argument. 
Perhaps you might have stated your 
opinion and opened up discussion. 
You could even scroll past the post 
and move on with your day. With 
all of these options open, there re-
ally appears to be no reason for one 
to needlessly point out an error.
However, Your Fat Friend’s logic 
takes this a step further and ar-
gues that your “grammar policing” 
would be discriminatory against 
certain demographics. Perhaps she 
interprets it as an online version of 
laughing at one’s accent or the way 
one speaks, therefore discrimina-
tory. While I can understand her 
sentiment, considering grammar 
policing to be discriminatory is a 
stretch. There are many 
words that can 
describe “unsolicited grammar po-
licing:” inane, childish, and silly, 
to name a few. However, none of 
those adjectives inherently mean 
discriminatory.
Each generation, despite its 
many differences, appears to have 
a common sense of optimism. The 
groups of youth strive to advocate 
for their respective perception of 
social justice. In this day and age, 
political correctness is a prominent 
theme. Topics such as intersection-
ality, diversity, and inclusion are all 
rampant when it comes to deter-
mining what is or is not acceptable 
to say or do.
“-isms,” such as elitism, able-
ism, and racism are all, undoubt-
edly, legitimate problems that 
deserve attention. However, 
claiming grammar policing to be 
a part of any of those problems 
is a stretch. Even though people 
who share Your Fat Friend’s sen-
timent most likely have good 
intentions and want to combat 
discrimination, these intentions 
may do more harm to these de-
mographics that they are trying 
to protect.
Loosely labeling seemingly 
innocuous actions as discrimina-
tory, can make the meaning of 
“discriminatory” appear to lose 
its signi?cance. For instance, the 
seeming overuse of the term “rac-
ism” causes some people to be-
come dubious of the extent of rac-
ism’s existence. For instance, in the 
Olympics this year, a coin toss was 
determined to be the tie-breaker 
should there be two athletes of 
similar accomplishments who are 
equally quali?ed to represent the 
U.S. and bear the ?ag. This method 
was agreed upon across the board. 
However, when the coin toss fell 
against speedskater Shani Davis’ 
favor, he tweeted: “I am an Ameri-
can and when I won the 1,000m 
in 2010 I became the ?rst Ameri-
can to [two-peat] in that event. @
TeamUSA dishonorably tossed a 
coin to decide its 2018 ?ag bearer. 
No problem. I can wait until 2022. 
#BlackHistoryMonth2018.” 
By putting the hashtag, he blamed 
racism, not sheer chance, on the out-
come. Now, his Twitter account is pri-
vate, most likely due to the backlash 
and criticism that ensued.
There is no doubt we need to 
continue the dialogue on 
racism. How-
ever, is 
calling an event that occurred 
based on pure chance racist pro-
moting fruitful dialogue on rac-
ism? No. Instead, we could look 
at policies that disproportionally 
affect certain racial demographics 
or re?ect on our own racial biases 
that affect how we perceive others. 
Focusing on policies that dispro-
portionally affects education ac-
cessibility and poverty rates would 
effectively help create an even 
playing ?eld across demographics. 
Celebrating the accomplishments 
of various black people through-
out the years would help empower 
the youth. Had Davis made the 
tweet of his accomplishments and 
left out his comment pertaining 
to the coin toss, he could have 
been a source of inspiration and 
the Black History Month hashtag 
would have been relevant. Howev-
er, the fact that he brought up rac-
ism when it was irrelevant made 
it appear as though racism is not 
a serious issue anymore. It’s the 
“cry wolf” effect in action. Just as 
the boy cried “wolf!” and nobody 
believed him when there was an 
actual wolf, people loosely crying 
out “racism” in situations where it 
isn’t applicable are causing others 
to become disillusioned that there 
is no racism.
Similarly, we should look at 
“grammar policing” and not re-
sort to social justice jargon where 
it isn’t applicable. Claim-
ing scrutinizing grammar 
where unapplicable is 
damaging to those 
with disabilities 
causes people to be 
desensitized to le-
gitimate problems 
and policies that 
go against people 
with disabilities. 
Instead, we can 
demand healthcare 
programs to be acces-
sible to those with dis-
abilities and help reduce 
the stigma surrounding dis-
abilities. Likewise, providing 
accessible education for the 
economically disadvantaged 
is far more productive than de-
nouncing grammar policing as 
“attacking poor folks.”
Our society has great room 
for improvement in terms of en-
suring equity and quality of life 
for all people. However, calling 
out grammar policing to ?ght 
against discrimination against 
certain demographics can actu-
ally serve to be detrimental to 
those demographics. Instead, 
we should focus on dialogue 
pertaining to policies that affect 
people’s lives and call grammar 
policing what it is: silly.

Humans have been fas-
cinated with the sky since 
the beginning of our ex-
istence. In the 1880s, our 
ability to visualize space 
reached a breakthrough: 
people ?gured out a way 
to manufacture highly 
re?ective concave mir-
rors. According to the 
University of California 
Observatories website, 
this development enabled 
an amateur astronomer 
named Andrew Common 
to be the ?rst to discover 
that stars too faint to be 
seen by the naked eye 
could be photographed 
with long exposures.
Astrophotography has 
advanced markedly since 
then, and will soon see 
another breakthrough. 
The James Webb Space 
Telescope (JWST), or 
commonly referred to 
as Webb, which is set to 
launch from French Gui-
ana in Spring 2019, will 
be “the premier observa-
tory of the next decade, 
serving thousands of as-
tronomers worldwide,” 
according to its NASA 
webpage.
Space-based tele-
scopes, such as the JWST 
and the Hubble Space 
Telescope (HST), also re-
ferred to as the Hubble, 
were introduced in the 
late 20th century. Many 
are familiar with Hubble 
due its technicolor im-
ages which have become 
iconic. NASA is billing 
the JWST as Hubble’s 
successor — their scien-
ti?c goals for it were mo-
tivated by the discoveries 
made with Hubble’s help. 
But there are several key 
differences between the 
two telescopes.
Webb has a much 
larger light-collecting 
mirror, giving it a ?eld of 
view about 15 times big-
ger than Hubble’s. And, it 
will orbit the earth from 
a much greater distance: 
1.5 million kilometers, 
compared to Hubble’s 
569.
While Hubble scans 
light from the universe in 
the visible range, Webb 
will study it primarily in 
the infrared. The infrared 
spectrum is particularly 
interesting to scientists 
because of two different 
phenomena. First, dust 
clouds absorb light in the 
visible ranges, but allow 
infrared wavelengths to 
pass through. Studying 
the infrared means that 
we can see stars and plan-
ets which are shrouded 
dust.

Researchers at the 
Human Computer 
Interaction Institute and 
the Language Technologies 
Institute at Carnegie Mel-
lon University have created 
a human powered conversa-
tional agent called Evorus, 
that works with humans to 
become better over time.
Previously, crowd-
powered systems have ex-
isted, but come at high mon-
etary and latency costs. So, 
the obvious solution is to 
create a hybrid human-AI 
powered system.
Evorus automatizes over 
time, using help from real 
humans, hired as needed 
using Amazon’s Mechanical 
Turk — a “service to build 
human intelligence directly 
into applications” using the 
Ignition model. As described 
in the paper published by 
the team, it achieves this 
automatization by “(i) al-
lowing new chatbots to be 
easily integrated to auto-
mate more scenarios, (ii) re-
using prior crowd answers, 
and (iii) learning to auto-
matically approve response 
candidates.”
The team tested this 
system for a period of 
?ve months, with 80 par-
ticipants in 281 conversa-
tions. They observed that 
even while automatizing, 
Evorus didn’t compromise 
on conversational quality. 
At the moment the system 
automatizes about 10 to 
15 percent of its conversa-
tions and can have up to 
?ve workers on a single 
chat. The workers rate each 
other’s response quality to 
maintain chat quality.
Other completely au-
tomated conversational 
agents like Apple’s Siri, Mi-
crosoft’s Cortana, and Ama-
zon’s Alexa, are popular but 
seem quite unnatural. They 
are equipped to handle re-
sponses only within a cer-
tain domain and fail when 
asked a question outside of 
that domain. In fact, some-
times, they fail to respond 
accurately even when the 
question is within their do-
main, simply because of the 
way a question was phrased. 
There are even guide books 
on talking to these conversa-
tional assistants. Speaking 
of how Evorus differs from 
these agents, Jeff Bingham 
— a researcher on the study 
said, “Companies have put 
a lot of effort into teaching 
people how to talk to con-
versational agents, given 
the devices’ limited com-
mand of speech and topics 
… Now, we’re letting people 
speak more freely and it’s 
the agent that must learn to 
accommodate them.”
On March 26, 2013 
Microsoft released Tay — 
an arti?cial intelligence 
chatbot on Twitter with 
disastrous results. Tay was 
supposed to mimic the con-
versational patterns of a 
19-year old American girl 
and respond while learn-
ing from the other users of 
Twitter. However, the bot 
was attacked by “trolls,” 
and starting making rac-
ist, in?ammatory, and of-
fensive tweets at users, ul-
timately having to be shut 
down only 16 hours after it 
was launched. While this is 
only one of the examples in 
which human beings on the 
internet cannot be trusted 
with AI, the real takeaway 
is that with all the informa-
tion that is being plugged 
into these systems, there has 
to be a way of making the 
bot discriminate between 
what information is useful 
and what isn’t. Ting-Hao 
Huang, a Ph.D. student in 
the Language Technologies 
Institute said in a Carnegie 
Mellon press release that 
having multiple humans in 
the loop reduces chances 
of malicious manipulation 
by other users. Evorus it-
self is a part of Chorus — a 
Google Hangouts chat bot 
powered by crowd-workers. 
The paper was presented at 
the ACM CHI Conference 
on Human Factors in Com-
puting Systems recently 
in Montreal and won the 
Honorable Mention Award 
(top ?ve percent) there. 
This research at Carnegie 
Mellon was funded by Proj-
ect InMind, sponsored by 
Yahoo! and Oath. Bingham 
said, “With Evorus, we’ve 
hit a sweet spot in the col-
laboration between the ma-
chine and the crowd.”

The National Science 
Foundation’s (NSF) Expedi-
tions in Computing program 
will fund a ?ve-year program 
that allows scientists from 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
Harvard University, Rice 
University, Cornell Univer-
sity, and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology to 
work together. The $10 mil-
lion grant wil be used to de-
velop a type of camera that 
is wearable, and will help to 
look deep under the skin to 
help identify and diagnose 
health problems non-inva-
sively. 
Ashutosh Sabharwal, a 
professor of Electrical and 
Computer Engineering at 
Rice University and the 
grant’s principal investiga-
tor, said, “The project will 
produce a platform tech-
nology for in vivo 3D tissue 
imaging, with the aim of be-
ing able to point a camera to 
a part of the body and see 
live biology below the skin 
without making an incision 
or drawing blood.” The in-
terdisciplinary team is com-
prised of 11 other co-inves-
tigators, out of which four 
are from Carnegie Mellon 
University. 
In a Carnegie Mellon 
press release, professor 
Srinivasa Narasimhan of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics 
Institute said, “Bioimaging 
today enables us to see just 
a few millimeters beneath 
the skin...We’d like to go ?ve 
to 10 times deeper. With ev-
ery additional millimeter we 
go, this technology becomes 
more useful. We hope that 
eventually it might reduce or 
eliminate the need for biop-
sies.” 
This image technology 
takes advantage of “com-
putational scatterography.” 
When one shines a smart-
phone light through their 
hand, they can see the 
gleaming red tissue scatter-
ing light as it passes through 
their body. While this phe-
nomenon was thought to 
have no use in biomedical 
imaging, the process of com-
putational scatterography 
allows us to make use of 
this phenomenon, by trac-
ing the paths taken by the 
photons post-scattering. 
This technology has been 
used by Carnegie Mellon 
researchers to see through 
fog, snow, and heavy rain, 
says Ioannis Gkioulekas, As-
sistant Professor of Robotics. 
Sabharwal claims that this 
could make the diagnosis of 
over 100 disorders diagnos-
able by non-invasive means. 
As a wearable device, this 
could lead a revolution in 
healthcare. 
Sabharwal says, “Imag-
ine a wearable device no 
larger than a watch that uses 
sensors to continuously mea-
sure white blood cell count 
and wirelessly communi-
cates with the oncologist’s 
of?ce...The patient could go 
about their daily life. They’d 
only have to go to the hospi-
tal if there was a problem.”

Researchers draw brain map of moths’ sense of smell
EMMA FLICKINGER
Assistant SciTech Editor
In a study published in 
Cell Reports, researchers 
mapped the part of the 
moth brain that process-
es smells. They exposed 
hawkmoths to 80 differ-
ent odors, traced the path 
of the odor from the sen-
sory organ to the brain, 
and tried to determine 
how the moths’ brains in-
terpreted the meaning of 
each odor.
Hawkmoths feed on 
tobacco, agave, and other 
nightshade family plants 
that rely on insects for 
pollination.
Moths pick up smells 
with their antennae. 
When the antennae de-
tect a scent, they send the 
scent information back 
to the moth’s brain, in an 
area called the antennal 
lobe, where the scents are 
interpreted by the brain.
To expose the moths to 
each different smell in the 
study — all of which could 
be found in the moths’ 
natural environment — 
the researchers soaked a 
small paper in the target 
scent and set it up in a tiny 
station in a wind tunnel.
“To study odor-guided 
behavior, we need an air-
stream to bring the odor 
plume to the animal,” said 
Sonja Bisch-Knaden of 
the Max Planck Institute 
for Chemical Ecology, the 
study’s ?rst author. “In 
addition, wind motivates 
the moths to start fanning 
their wings for one to two 
minutes (they need that to 
warm up) and then to ?y 
upwind.”
The researchers collect-
ed data directly from the 
brains of female moths, 
using a method called 
calcium imaging. 
The calcium imaging 
allowed them to see what 
parts of the antennal lobe, 
called glomuleri, were ac-
tivated by each scent, and 
they used their observa-
tions of the activated glo-
muleri to draw a “scent 
map” of the antennal lobe.
To ?nd out what the 
different scents meant to 
the moths, the researchers 
observed their behavior in 
the wind tunnel, watch-
ing out for important be-
haviors — like whether 
the moths moved over 
to pause in front of the 
paper, or extended their 
proboscis (mouthpart) to 
taste the paper. They also 
kept watch for when the 
moths grabbed the paper 
and curled up: the posi-
tion they take to lay eggs.
By examining the 
moths’ behavior and com-
paring it to their brain 
map, the researchers 
found out which speci?c 
groups of glomuleri are 
tied to feeding and egg-
laying behavior. 
This could suggest that 
the moths rely on their 
sense of smell to tell them 
which plants are safe to 
eat and to lay eggs on.
Why map the sense of 
smell of a moth? “Pollina-
tion is an important ser-
vice performed by insects, 
and many of the fruits we 
eat depend on it. Especial-
ly in times of increasing 
pollution and decreasing 
insect numbers, it might 
be bene?cial to under-
stand cues that guarantee 
this service,” said Binsch-
Knaden.
“We would next like to 
test whether the position 
of the ‘feeding glomeruli’ 
and ‘egg laying glomeruli’ 
is conserved in different 
moth species,” she added. 
“Studying the brain acti-
vation patterns in honey-
bees would also be very 
interesting because bees, 
although they are day-
active and heavily rely on 
visual cues to ?nd ?owers, 
also can use ?ower odors 
for navigation.”

Early concept art of the James Webb Space Telescope. The Webb has been described as the Hubble Space Telescope’s scienti?c successor, but the two telescopes differ in scope and capabilities.
James Webb Space Telescope will let us see back in time
From WEBB, A6
To appreciate the second 
advantage, one must ?rst 
understand a concept 
called “red shift.” As the 
European Space Agency ex-
plains, red shift is much like 
the “Doppler effect.” Think 
of how the pitch of a siren 
changes as an ambulance 
approaches and passes you. 
The sound waves are com-
pressed and arrive closer 
together as it approaches, 
and are stretched, arriv-
ing farther apart as it trav-
els away. We know that 
the universe is expanding, 
which means the galaxies 
we want to look at are trav-
eling away from us. Like 
the sound waves, the light 
is stretched to longer wave-
lengths, which correspond 
to the red and infrared end 
of the spectrum.
Webb’s infrared capa-
bilities will allow us to see 
farther back in time than 
we could with Hubble. 
Because it takes quite 
a bit of time for light from 
the farthest reaches of 
the universe to make it to 
Earth, we will be able to see 
some of the ?rst stars, and 
what the Webb website de-
scribes as “baby galaxies;” 
ones whose light has been 
stretched and reach us in 
the infrared region.
Besides the scienti?c 
discoveries the team prom-
ises of Webb, the images 
produced from the new 
telescope are expected to 
be as stunning as those 
from Hubble. But they pose 
a challenge: how do you 
transform infrared images 
into something we can see?
Zoltan Levay has worked 
as the Imaging Team Lead 
at the Space Telescope Sci-
ence Institute in Baltimore 
since 1994, transform-
ing the raw data from the 
Hubble telescope into the 
beautiful ?nal images. His 
new job will be to do the 
same for the Webb once it 
is launched. It turns out 
the process won’t be too 
different.
Levay’s team starts with 
black and white images, 
each taken through differ-
ent color ?lters. They then 
layer two or three from dif-
ferent color ?lters on top 
of each other. This is easy 
when capturing a range 
of colors that can be split 
along our eyes’ natural red-
green-blue response, like 
much of Hubble’s imagery. 
But, it becomes more chal-
lenging when converting 
a narrow range of wave-
lengths or wavelengths 
outside the visible range. 
It’s at this point when a lit-
tle artistic liberty is taken. 
“The most important thing 
for us is we don’t want 
to make things up,” says 
Joseph DePasquale, who 
joined the team a year ago. 
So, they use a technique 
called “representative col-
or” or “chromatic order-
ing,” in which each image 
from a speci?c ?lter is as-
signed a color in the visible 
range. In this system, the 
shortest infrared wave-
lengths would be assigned 
green, and the longest red. 
The colored images are 
then stacked on top of each 
other to create the ?nal 
look.
If you still feel the need 
to ask if the colors are real, 
consider the answer given 
by Webb’s Frequently Asked 
Questions page: “Color is a 
tool, which can enhance an 
object’s detail or visualize 
what could never been seen 
by the human eye.”
The Webb is a $8.8 
billion project, that has 
been in the making for 
two decades. It is the suc-
cessor to NASA’s Hubble 
Telescope’s glory days. 
After the Webb, NASA 
intends to send the Wide-
Field Infrared Survey 
Telescope (WFIRST) — a 
space telescope that will 
study exoplanets and dark 
energy. In this, there have 
been budgeting issues 
where NASA has asked the 
WFIRST team to cut their 
budget by $400 million. 
The Trump administration 
even proposed canceling 
the project altogether.

MADNESS, from A10
Teams to Watch
Michigan State University
With a solid effective 
?eld goal percentage and 
the No. 7 defense, Michigan 
State University is a solid 
contender in this year’s 
tournament. The Spartans 
won 12 straight games 
since their at home loss to 
rival University of Michigan 
on Jan. 13 until their loss 
to the Wolverines again, 
last Saturday in the Big Ten 
tournament. Players such 
as sophomore point guard 
Cassius Winston, with the  
highest percentage of long-
range shots in Division 
I, make this team one to 
watch.
However, there is some 
off-court drama with 
sophomore Miles Bridges 
and his mother, both of 
whom are facing federal 
charges for corruption in 
college basketball that 
threatened to interfere 
with game-play. Despite 
being cleared, Bridges’ 
performance has not been 
as strong since.
Purdue University
As one of the best 
shooting teams in the 
country, the Purdue 
University Boilermakers are 
a powerhouse team coming 
into March Madness. They 
have ?ve players with a 38 
percent or higher hit rate 
outside of the three-point 
line. Purdue also boasts 
one of the best Big Ten 
players, sophomore Carsen 
Edwards. Seniors Isaac 
Haas, Vince Edwards, and 
Dakota Mathias are also 
strong players averaging at 
least 12 points per game.
Even if they lose the Big 
Ten tournament crown to 
Michigan on Sunday night, 
this team will still be a force 
to be reckoned with. After 
two losses at the Battle 
4 Atlantis tournament, 
Purdue has managed 19 
consecutive wins and ranks 
very highly in offensive and 
defensive ef?ciency.
Ohio State University
Another team to watch 
is the Ohio State University 
Buckeyes who earlier in 
the season did not seem 
to be very favorable or 
begin with a lot of buzz. 
After replacing longtime 
head coach Thad Matta 
with Chris Holtmann, the 
Buckeyes did not fare well, 
bringing in only 17 wins 
and a 7-11 record.
Ohio State has been able 
to come back by defending 
well in the three-point arc. 
This is the one thing they 
have going for them coming 
into the tournament. It will 
be interesting to see how far 
this solid defense is able to 
carry them.
March Madness is fun: 
it allows those with college 
allegiances to root for their 
team around the country, 
and others to turn on the 
television and choose a 
team. For players, this is 
an opportunity to ful?ll 
their dreams, or become a 
star. Who will be this year’s 
tournament Cinderella 
story?
Hopefully, this was 
helpful for those unfamiliar 
with March Madness and 
a good reminder for those 
who are gearing up for 
another month of March 
and the madness that 
comes with it.
Several Big Ten teams in running for tournament
SPORTS BRIEFS
Women’s Tennis
The 10th-ranked 
Carnegie Mellon University 
women’s tennis team played

after clearing the bar at 3.57 
meters at the unscored team 
event. Miholer ?nished sixth 
with a height of 3.42 meters. 
The senior’s mark was a 
career-best.
Karabin and Miholer 
along with the rest of 
the Tartans will continue 
their season in two weeks 
when the outdoor season 
begins for the Tartans at 
the Washington and Lee 
University Track and Field 
Carnival on Friday, March 
16.
Men’s Track & Field
A handful of Carnegie 
Mellon University men’s 
track and ?eld athletes 
competed at the Polar Bear 
Final Quali?er on Saturday 
afternoon hosted by Ohio 
Northern University at the 
Kinghorn Fieldhouse.
Junior Isaac Mills ran to 
a top ?nish in the 800-meter 
run with a personal-
best time of 1:54.50. His 
converted time of 1:52.89 
currently ranks him 21st 
nationally. Sophomore Evan 
Yukevich placed second in 
the mile run after crossing 
in 4:23.35.
In the ?eld events, 
sophomore Rai Walters 
recorded a distance of 6.44 
meters in the long jump to 
place second. Senior Tommy 
Mans?eld took third pole 
vault after clearing the bar 
at 4.38 meters.
Senior Jacob Schofel 
competed in the weight 
throw and shot put placing 
fourth and seventh, 
respectively. He tossed the 
weight 16.38 meters and the 
shot put 12.95 meters. First-
year Bram Miller competed 
in the shot put and placed 
?fth with a toss of 14.80 
meters.
Mills will now wait to see 
if he quali?es for the NCAA 
Indoor Championships, 
which will take place March 
9 and 10 at the Birmingham 
Crossplex in Birmingham, 
AL.
Women’s and Men’s 
Swimming & Diving
Four Carnegie Mellon 
University divers competed 
at the 2018 NCAA Division 
III Region 4 Diving 
Championships at Ithaca 
College in Ithaca, NY, from 
March 2-3. Junior Gabe 
Bamforth ?nished high 
enough to qualify for his 
third trip to the NCAA 
Championships later in 
March.
Bamforth ?nished fourth 
on the 3-meter board Friday 
evening with a point total 
of 479.45 and registered 
a score of 475.10 on the 
1-meter board Saturday 
afternoon to place third. 
His ?nishes pitted him third 
overall which resulted in his 
quali?cation to the NCAA 
Championships.
Senior DeShawn Green 
competed in his ?rst regional 
meet, earning scores of 
377.05 and 347.60 on the 
1-meter and 3-meter boards,

Did you know Carnegie 
Mellon has a ?gure skating 
club?
That’s a question Jennifer 
Lott and Cheyenne Bell have 
been answering for over 
three years, ever since they 
founded the club as ?rst-
year students in Jan. 2015.
Bell, a senior architecture 
student, has been skating 
since she was six years old. 
She wanted to continue 
skating in college, but when 
she was making her college 
decision, Carnegie Mellon’s 
academics outweighed the 
fact the school didn’t have 
a ?gure skating club at the 
time. She set her sights on a 
new goal: she was going to 
start a ?gure skating club.
What happened was 
serendipitous: “When I was 
on the housing portal, I 
found this girl who said on 
her bio, ‘I ?gure skate,’” Bell 
said in an interview with The 
Tartan. “I was like, ‘No way!’ 
and I messaged her saying, 
‘I’m also a ?gure skater. I 
want to start a ?gure skating 
club and I can’t take no for 
an answer.’”
That other ?gure skater 
was Lott, now a senior 
chemical engineering major, 
a nine-year skating veteran 
when she entered college.
“I came to CMU and there 
wasn’t a ?gure skating club,” 
Lott said in an interview with 
The Tartan. “I really had no 
intention of continuing to 
skate in college until I met 
Cheyenne, and she had this 
grand vision of starting this 
?gure skating club.”
As co-founders and co-
presidents, there have been 
several challenges Bell 
and Lott have faced in the 
last three and a half years. 
The ?rst was receiving 
recognition as a legitimate 
organization by the univer-
sity, especially considering 
the expensive costs of ?gure 
skating as a sport.
“When we were [?rst-
years], it was a lot more 
dif?cult to found a club,” 
Lott said. “I think it has 
become easier over the 
years for newer clubs, but 
we eventually proved that 
we were going to ?nancially 
support ourselves as a club.”
Because Carnegie Mellon 
does not have a rink, sched-
uling practices have been 
dif?cult for the team. 
They split time at Robert 
Morrison University Island 
Sports Center and Alpha 
Ice Complex. Both rinks are 
a 30-minute drive away, 
a dif?cult trip for twelve 
team members with two 
cars. The team understands 
the time commitments 
and challenges of being a 
Carnegie Mellon student, 
and thus they try to be 
?exible.
Due to her school 
schedule, sophomore math 
and physics major Victoria 
Kubyshko practices once 
a week while other team 
members may practice 
up to four times a week. 
Though Kubyshko, who be-
gan skating at three years 
old, isn’t as competitive 
as she was when she was 
younger, the sport remains 
an important part of her life. 
“It’s not really something I 
can give up. I can’t imagine 
stopping,” she said in an 
interview with The Tartan.
In the fall of 2015, 
the team transitioned 
into a competition team, 
competing under the U.S. 
Figure Skating governing 
body. A member of the 
Eastern collegiate region, the 
team is eligible to compete 
in three competitions a 
year, where teams enter 
skaters to earn points. 
After the third competition, 
the top four teams from 
each region compete 
in U.S. Intercollegiate 
Championships.
The ?rst season, 2015-16, 
a crowdfunding campaign 
supported Carnegie Mellon’s 
team for the expenses of one 
competition. The next year, 
they were able to compete in 
two of the competitions. This 
season, they will compete in 
all three competitions for 
the ?rst time as an of?cial 
club, and are hosting the 
third. They are currently 
in seventh place out of 28 
teams, including Boston 
University, and Dartmouth 
College.
“Hopefully they will go 
to nationals; it seems like 
it’s something that could 
de?nitely happen with time. 
Unfortunately, I will not be 
there,” Bell said.
Carnegie Mellon’s ?gure 
skating team, at three-and-
a-half years old, will be the 
youngest club to ever host an 
intercollegiate competition. 
The Carnegie Cup will be 
held from March 17-18 at 
the UPMC Lemieux Sports 
Complex, the Pittsburgh 
Penguins’ of?cial practice 
rink, and host 21 teams 
across the east coast.
Bell, Lott, and Kubyshko 
— along with two other 
team veterans — have 
been organizing the 
Carnegie Cup on top of 
their other responsibilities 
as students. They raised 
the $30,000 needed to host 
the competition, booked 
ice time at the rink, and 
coordinated the judges 
needed for the event.
They are excited to host 
the competition and for 
the opportunity to prove 
themselves, especially 
considering the dif?culties 
they faced early in the club’s 
existence.
“We had such a hard time 
at the beginning of being 
a club. We had a hard time 
being recognized, but we 
can do it,” Bell said. “We can 
prove that we can do this.”
The team is also looking 
forward to the recognition 
the competition will bring 
the club in the ?gure skating 
community. As the club 
has steadily increased its 
funding, legitimacy, and 
awareness, more incoming 
students have cited the 
existence of the team as 
a reason for coming to 
Carnegie Mellon.
Kubyshko, who grew 
up in Texas, was deciding 
between Carnegie Mellon 
and a school in Texas, which 
did not have a ?gure skating 
club, to go to college. 
While academics had more 
importance in her decision, 
the fact Carnegie Mellon 
did have ?gure skating did 
contribute.
“It’s been a small group 
and we’re close,” she said. 
“I’ve been there for part of 
the growth, mainly from 
last year to this year, [as 
we] doubled in size. Now 
I can think about what we 
can accomplish in two more 
years.”
Lott said seeing how 
much the team has grown 
has been very impactful to 
her. “To hear [?rst-years] say 
that they chose to come to 
Carnegie Mellon because we 
have a ?gure skating team, 
and I am part of the reason 
we have a ?gure skating 
team, is very inspiring.”
“I’m very grateful for 
where it is now,” Bell said. 
“I almost wish that I was like 
one of the [?rst-years] who 
just joined this year, ‘cause 
I think that it’s really great 
that now that ?gure skaters 
can come to [Carnegie 
Mellon] and continue 
skating. There will always 
be a little place in my heart 
for CMU ?gure skating.”

The Pittsburgh Penguins 
are hot, even after a recent 
streak of three bad games. 
Before the three losses, 
the Pens won six in a row, 
beating tough, potential 
playoff teams like the Los 
Angeles Kings, Toronto 
Maple Leafs, and the 
Columbus Blue Jackets. 
The Penguins put up four 
or more goals in ?ve of 
those six wins and looked 
as dominant as they ever 
have.
The Pens dropped the 
last three games to the 
Florida Panthers, New 
Jersey Devils, and Boston 
Bruins, mostly due to 
lackluster goaltending from 
backups Casey DeSmith 
and Tristan Jarry, who 
were forced to step up after 
starting goalie Matt Murray 
sustained a concussion in 
practice. The defense also 
seemed lost on the ice, with 
defenseman Matt Hunwick 
looking particularly rough 
on the ice. They looked like 
they were in a bit of a spring 
slump, but that all changed 
Saturday night.
The Pens beat out the 
New York Islanders in 
overtime on Saturday in 
a bounce-back victory 
that saw trade deadline 
acquisition Derick Brassard 
score his ?rst goal as a 
Penguin. It was marked 
by a strong performance 
by Tristan Jarry, although 
he had a shaky start when 
he let in the ?rst goal after 
tripping in front of the 
crease. He recovered and 
looked as dominant as he 
did before his string of a 
few bad games. Sidney 
Crosby put in the overtime 
winner against the Isles to 
cap off an important win.
The win against the 
Islanders saw a shake-up 
in the lineup. Fourth 
line Carter Rowney was 
scratched in exchange for 
youngster Dominik Simon, 
and defenseman Matt 
Hunwick was scratched in 
favor of Chad Ruhwedel. 
The Pens looked stronger, 
with the whole fourth line 
playing signi?cantly better 
and the defense looking 
much stronger.
This recovery from 
the last three losses was 
a welcome relief for Pens 
fans. The trade deadline 
deal General Manager 
Jim Rutherford made to 
bring Brassard to the team 
looked good but losing 
shot-blocking defenseman 
Ian Cole seemed to be a 
big problem for the Pens 
in those last three losses, 
where the Penguins’ 
defense looked like it 
reverted to the way it was 
in late 2017.
The Penguins also lost 
enforcer Ryan Reaves, who 
brought a huge locker room 
presence to the team and 
seemed to be heating up 
in his last few games as a 
Penguin. Fortunately, the 
Penguins have bounced 
back and looked solid 
enough to make a deep 
playoff run and potentially 
defend their back-to-back 
Stanley Cup Championship 
titles.

Well, the time is ?nally 
here for everyone to start 
thinking about their 
brackets. I know what 
you’re thinking: Where do I 
begin? How do I choose my 
teams? What even is March 
Madness? Well, worry not, 
because I am here to help 
you. If you’re just as clueless 
as me but decided to try and 
get involved anyway, we’ll 
?gure this out together.
What is March Madness?
March Madness is the 
one time of the year that 
everyone, except for the 
few people that actually 
are interested, pretends like 
they are passionate about 
college basketball. It’s the 
National Collegiate Athletic 
Association (NCAA) 
Division I college men’s 
basketball tournament. 
Despite having March in the 
name, the event culminates 
with the ?nal championship 
game at the beginning of 
April. Much like Easter, 
the date of this game can 
?uctuate between the end 
of March and the begin-
ning of April. However, the 
madness truly does happen 
in March.
Games are played 
elimination style and begin 
with 68 teams. Teams are 
slowly knocked out until 
only 16 teams remain. 
This group, titled the 
Sweet Sixteen, is often 
where the casual watcher 
begins to actually start 
to pay attention. This 
continues to the Elite Eight, 
Final Four, and ?nally, 
the championship game 
resulting in a winner.
Calendar of Events
March 11: Selection Sunday
This is the day that 
the 68 teams that will 
compete are chosen. This 
is also the day where the 
men’s brackets and seeds, 
or rankings, are released 
to the public. Teams are 
chosen to participate in 
two ways. The ?rst way is 
an automatic bid, which 
is given to the 32 teams 
that win their conference’s 
championship. The second 
option is an at-large bid. 
These teams are chosen by 
the selection committee 
after regular season and 
conference tournaments 
based on merit and their 
performance thus far. This 
is how the remaining 36 
teams are chosen.
March 13–March 14: First 
Four
These are the ?rst four 
games of the tournament. 
They are played between 
the four lowest seeded 
automatic bid teams and the 
four lowest-seeded at-large 
bid teams. These games are 
usually played a few days 
after Selection Sunday and 
determine which of the 
eight teams playing will 
advance to the ?rst round 
of the tournament.
March 15–March 25: The 
Madness
This is the time for the 
rest of the games of the 
tournament to unfold. 
Teams go head-to-head un-
til a ?nal four is chosen from 
the Midwest, West, South, 
and East Regional games. 
The Final Four compete on 
March 31 and April 2.

On finding time for yourself
Dear Izzy,
I’ve been having, well, sort of a really weird, 
deep problem lately. Ever since I’ve come to 
college, I’ve made a ton of new friends and 
have gotten the chance to open up to people 
and just grow as a person. But, I feel like I am 
spending too much time with them. To rephrase 
it, I feel like I haven’t been able to spend time 
with myself lately. I used to be a completely 
different, shy person in high school. That changed 
almost immediately once I got to college, went 
through Orientation Week, and met a lot of my 
current friends (just part of the typical freshman 
experience). I don’t know why I’ve lately began 
to feel like I’ve lost touch with myself. It seems 
especially weird, since I’m halfway through my 
second semester, so you’d think I’d have enough 
time to process this because Orientation Week was 
so long ago and I’ve had at least one semester 
under my belt. And, it’s not like I don’t appreciate 
my friends; maybe I’m just having a hard time 
balancing a social life since I’ve never really had 
one before. Is there anything you can recommend 
I do?
From,
Missing Every Time Introvert Mindset Exists
Dear ME TIME,
It’s awesome to hear how much you’ve blossomed 
and grown in college already, and that you 
seem to be going through a smooth transition! 
That fact alone can be surprisingly comforting in 
hard times, and I’m glad you’ve built up a strong 
support network that you can fall back on if you 
need to. However, I will agree that taking time for 
yourself is important too.
Every week, try to find some time — it doesn’t 
have to be long, and can be from 10 minutes to 
three hours — to just spend with yourself. Take a 
step back from everything going on in your life 
and focus on YOU: what do you specifically want 
to do in that moment? What do you enjoy doing? 
If it’s watching Netflix, great. If it’s reading 
Harry Potter for the 13th time, great. Heck, even 
if it’s doing work, that’s fine too, as long as it’s 
something you enjoy doing by yourself. I’ve been 
setting aside some time to plan out my schedule 
for the future, and it’s a great trick for laying out 
any personal goals and staying on top of things.
The question on how to balance your social life is 
a little bit harder to answer, because honestly, I’m
Jade Crockem | Contributing EditorBrunch Buddies: Coca Café
This week I decided to opt for brunch over a bar. 
I wasn’t up for all the crazy people you meet at 
the bar and let’s face it, I was hungry. So, I found 
myself in Lawrenceville at Coca Café, a small 
restaurant whose breakfast packs quite the punch. 
This place boasts a ton of five star Yelp reviews, 
and after my visit I can definitely see why.
The location: Situated at the edge of Lower 
Lawrenceville, Coca Café is in the perfect hipster 
brunch location. The wait was quite a while but 
there was plenty to do and see as we roamed 
the gentrified streets. This location also puts you 
a nice distance away from campus, if that’s what 
you’re going for. Many students know about 
Lawrenceville but often don’t find themselves 
making it past Shadyside when considering brunch 
options.
The vibe: The restaurant itself is very small. I could 
probably count the number of tables on my two 
hands. This seems to be a trend for Pittsburgh 
restaurants though, so I did not find this terribly 
surprising. The decor and vibe was a bit whimsical 
and playful. There’s also some interesting art on 
the wall that you can’t help but look at.
The food: It is a café, so they also boast an 
extensive coffee and drink menu with something 
for everyone. Of course what you came to read 
about was the food, and it did not disappoint. 
One thing I liked about Coca Café was the portion 
sizes. They were filling and very manageable. I 
wasn’t overwhelmed with an IHOP style portion of 
food.
I had the challah french toast with melted brie, fig 
jam, and berries. I never knew how well brie went 
with sweet things until I tried this. It was the perfect 
balance of sweet but not too sweet and the brie 
was literally the icing on top (it was melted and 
kind of spread like icing too). Also, figs are not a 
terribly sweet fruit so it was a perfect balance. I 
wish I could have tried more things on the menu, 
because, while I opted for sweet, there were some 
strong savory options. There were also a few silly 
options, like the french toast covered in Cap’n 
Crunch cereal.
Lit or Nah: I don’t know how well this particular 
category pertains to brunch, but I’m going to say 
nah. Don’t get me wrong, the food was amazing 
and the place is definitely worth the trip, but it was 
a very calm brunch outing featuring a lot more 
families than millennials. I’m not sure if I need 
my brunch places to be over the top lit anyways. 
Overall, it was a quality restaurant, with some 
good food and fair prices, that I will definitely be 
visiting again.
For a small space and Cap’n Crunch-covered French Toast 
still going through this myself. Sometimes it’ll 
help to just analyze your week and sort of 
assess how you spend your time on work, 
friends, and on yourself. From there, you can 
then move on to adjust your organization of 
time as necessary. Just remember too that you 
are defining your own balance, and make sure 
to be a fair judge for yourself. And hopefully, 
after looking at your schedule, you’ll be able 
to carve out the me time that you definitely 
deserve.
Hope this helps!

“Tyler Childers, country singer.” That was about all the information I 
had on the up-and-coming musician before attending Childers’ concert 
at Stage AE this past Friday night. The name and label I had been 
given seemed common enough, preparing me for a smooth voice, 
a pair of cowboy boots, and a combination of sad love songs and 
upbeat odes to small towns and denim-short-wearing girls. But as I 
listened to Childers’ debut album, Purgatory, throughout the night, I 
was confronted instead with a gritty croon, flannel shirt, and stories of 
Kentucky, whisky, and hard times.
Childers was the perfect performer for a steel city like Pittsburgh; the 
singer-songwriter grew up with a coal mining father, and his voice 
and lyrics are Appalachia strong. Late Friday night, the line for 
Childers’ show wound its way around the block. Childers’ working 
class narratives and unique mix of folk, country, and bluegrass 
brought in an eclectic audience, from young couples and friends, to 
entire families, to older couples pushing their way onto the floor for a 
spot in the front row. The rising anticipation before Childers took the 
stage was nothing in comparison to the excitement and enthusiasm 
that met the singer as he began his set.
He may be new to the music scene, but Childers already 
boasts a loyal fan base. Listeners young and old 
matched each song with their own renditions of the lyrics and whistled 
at their favorite lines. As Childers strummed the first few notes of 
his song, “Deadman’s Curve,” the audience erupted in shouts of 
recognition and rose to meet the opening lyrics, shouting, “You can 
go to Hell my dear, you’d probably like it better there” as Childers 
smiled wryly.
While Childers released an earlier album entitled “Bottles and Bibles” 
in 2011, his 2017 release Purgatory truly announces his emergence as 
a formidable musician with a carefully crafted sound. The narratives 
Childers weaves over the course of the album tell a story informed by 
his experiences growing up in Kentucky, shifting from a restless youth 
to a settled man.
There’s an authenticity and honesty in Childers’ lyrics that you 
don’t often see in the music industry. Childers knows who he is and 
where he comes from, unashamedly sharing the mistakes he’s made 
and lessons he’s learned. He’s not a flashy performer, but a 
storyteller that reaches out to the common man. The poetry 
of his songwriting is reminiscent of the early Irish songs that 
first came to Appalachia, but the interweaving of Childers’ 
modern experiences with drugs, moonshine, religion, and 
love make his brand of mountain music more current and 
relatable.
There’s a dark humor to Childers’ music, found in 
both the lyrics and the marriage of darker themed 
songs with foot-stomping rhythms. It’s hard not to let 
a smile creep over your face at the sound of the joyful 
fiddle in the background, even as Childers sings about 
his certainty in the existence of Hell or the time he 
showed up at his girlfriend’s house too stoned to get 
back home. Throughout the night, audience members 
laughed out loud and took to open corners on the 
floor to kick their boots and dance along.

As a performer, Childers seems much older than his 26 years. He 
boasts a mature, clear voice and a mix of heartfelt, sometimes 
heartbreaking, lyrics. Musically, Childers isn’t messing around. 
The band and the music itself are just as integral and finely 
considered as Childers’ lyrics. As he performed, Childers focused 
wholly on the musical experience, pouring emotion into his words 
and giving his band mates time to shine.
The strength of Purgatory’s music and storytelling is due in 
part to the industry legends Childers has in his corner. Sturgill 
Simpson, the Grammy-award-winning musician, was impressed by 
Childers’ demo and offered to co-produce the album. With the 
help of his friend and acclaimed sound engineer, David Ferguson, 
Simpson brought together Childers’ band and helped Childers 
hone in on his craft.
It seems that Childers has performed the seemingly impossible 
task of returning country to its roots, to a place of storytelling 
and pride that appeals to all. It’s a feat that translates well on 
stage as well as on the charts. Upon its release, Purgatory took 
the top spot on Billboard’s Heatseekers chart, rose to number 
17 on the Country chart, and number four on the Americana/
Folk chart. For a debut album, Childers has accomplished the 
truly remarkable, and the authenticity of his sound guarantees 
continued success on the horizon.
That mountain music sound carried the audience through the 
night on an emotional and enjoyable journey. Childers closed 
the show with “Lady May,” a timeless love song about a woman 
who brings spring into the life of a toughened man who promises 
to love her well. It’s an incredibly earnest piece reminiscent of 
summer and tenderness that led audience members to lean into 
each other and sing along.
Before the show, I’d wondered what it was about Childers and his 
music that made his work appealing to so many different groups 
of people. As I listened to Childers’ near whisper of the closing 
lines of “Lady May” and watched the blue glint of the spotlight 
on the rapt faces of the audience, it became clear that Childers 
shares a portrait of America that we rarely get to see. One 
where people work hard and still have rough days, where people 
make mistakes on their way to true love, and where people are 
proud of where they come from and the faults they carry with 
them.
When the lights came up and the crowds filtered out into the 
cold, it seemed everyone left with a smile on their face, whistling 
the fiddle’s tune and carrying Childers’ words out into the night.
“Now I ain’t the toughest hickory
That your ax has ever felled
But I’m a hickory just as well
I’m a hickory all the same
I came crashin’ through the forest
As you cut my roots away
And I fell a good long ways
For my lovely Lady May”

---------------------------------------------------

This past Saturday, crowds flocked to 
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall 
for the International Championship of 
Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) Central 
Quarterfinal, eager to see the nine teams 
sing it out for the chance to move on to 
the ICCA Semifinals in Buffalo in three 
weeks time (and hopefully have a shot 
at making it to the finals in New York in 
April). With nine teams at the competi-
tion, three from Carnegie Mellon and 
six from the University of Pittsburgh, the 
auditorium was packed and buzzing with 
excitement as we all waited to see our 
beloved classmates, neighbors, and rivals 
take the stage.
First up was C# from Carnegie Mellon. 
Starting with 2AM Club’s “Worry About 
You,” I was immediately impressed by the 
way the group made the song their own. 
Next, they performed the classic Elvis 
Presley hit, “Can’t Help Falling in Love.” 
With big shoes to fill, the group did not 
disappoint, harmonizing beautifully and 
singing with passion and emotion. Lastly, 
they closed with C#’s signature mashup 
of Ariana Grande songs. Blending togeth-
er “Greedy,” “Dangerous Woman,” 
“Leave Me Lonely,” and “Sometimes,” 
I was impressed by the powerful lead 
throughout the performance and the 
backing vocals of the rest of the group, 
with the potential to rival Grande herself.
Pitches and Tones, the first University of 
Pittsburgh team of the night, was the next 
to perform. Immediately, I recognized the 
strength of the Pitt students’ choreogra-
phy. Beginning with a mashup of “Feeling 
Good” by Michael Bublé and “Start a 
Fire” by John Legend, the group show-
cased some powerful vocals, and only 
continued to awe the audience with a 
rendition of Rihanna’s “Sledgehammer.” 
Pitches and Tones only continued to 
shine, commanding the stage with their 
choreography and filling the room with 
their intense vocals. Lastly, they closed 
with an emotional, but not quite as 
impressive mashup of “What is Love” 
from the show Empire and “Green Light” 
by Lorde.
Carnegie Mellon was back with the 
Treblemakers. Returning again this semes-
ter with MisterWives’ “Machine,” they 
once again proved themselves to be 
formidable opponents in the a cappella 
circuit. The vocal percussion throughout 
their set was particularly incredible. 
Continuing with “Love So Soft” by Kelly 
Clarkson, the group did not fail to deliver 
another stellar performance. Last, they 
closed with an emotional and raw cover 
of Kesha’s “Praying.”
Next, the Pitt Pendulums performed 
decently, first with Disclosure’s 
“Magnets” and then Jon Bellion’s “The 
Good in Me.” While their first perfor-
mance was good, it was definitely not my 
favorite of the night. While they picked 
up momentum with a fantastic lead with a 
wide vocal range in Bellion’s song, their 
final song was by far their best. Miley 
Cyrus’ “FU” was an interesting choice, 
but they performed it with great power 
and fervor and truly engaged the audi-
ence with the more upbeat song.
University of Pittsburgh’s all-male group, 
Pitch Please, closed the first half of the 
show fervently. Their entertaining cho-
reographing and extreme vocal ranges 
really drew the audience in, with perfor-
mances of “Good Things Come to Those 
Who Wait” by Nathan Sykes, “Jealous” 
by Labrinth, and “Hit Me” by Dirty 
Loops. They were strong in their vocal 
consistency, each of them with an impres-
sive set of pipes.
After a short intermission, Sounds 
Like Treble, one of the University of 
Pittsburgh’s all-female group, started 
the second half strong. Their mashup of 
Imogen Heap’s “Hide and Seek” and 
Bishop Briggs’ “The Way I Do” exhibited 
strong choreography and vocals from all, 
with no clear lead in “Hide and Seek” 
and a strong and distinct lead through-
out “The Way I Do.” They then took on 
Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy,” and finished 
with a beautiful performance of Little 
Mix’s “Secret Love Song.”

---------------------------------------------------

Immediately after, University of 
Pittsburgh’s C Flat Run immediately 
reigned supreme on the stage, capturing 
the audience’s attention immediately with 
their intense, synchronized choreogra-
phy and their extremely strong vocals, 
showcasing their superiority among the 
groups. With a rich and powerful mashup 
of Alabama Shakes’ “Gimme All Your 
Love” and Donald Glover’s “Redbone,” 
followed by a pure and harmonious 
performance of Frances’ “Grow,” and 
closing with a mashup of Rihanna’s 
“Desperado” and Jay-Z’s “Run This 
Town,” C Flat Run truly managed to high-
light all of their strengths through the dif-
ferent styles and genres they chose.
The last University of Pittsburgh group 
for the night, the Songburghs, were defi-
nitely not least. While C Flat Run was a 
difficult act to follow, the Songburghs 
continued to capture the audience with 
their dramatic, eye-catching choreogra-
phy. Throughout all of their songs, the 
choreography seemed to tell a story and 
take their performance to new heights. 
With incredible beatboxing and a unique 
lead on NEEDTOBREATHE’s “Money 
and Fame,” the group finished with 
Rag’n’Bone Man’s “Wolves” and then 
Begonia’s “Out of My Head,” explor-
ing a wide range of tones, pitches, and 
styles, and succeeding in every way.
Finally, the night closed with Carnegie 
Mellon’s all-female a cappella group, 
Counterpoint. With the most emotion-
ally potent performance of the night, 
the group started with intensity. Their 
rendition of Wrabel’s “The Village” was 
hauntingly beautiful, and they utilized 
the stage well with simple but effective 
choreography. Next was Radiohead’s 
“Creep,” followed by the fun and upbeat 
MisterWives’ song, “Reflections,” accom-
panied by some fabulous beatboxing and 
choreography.
All in all, the nine groups were mesmer-
izing to watch. However, only two could 
make it to the next leg of the competi-
tion. Before the judges returned and the 
official results were announced, there 
was a performance by CMU Jiya, an all-
girls Bollywood fusion dance group, and 
an impromptu beatbox battle between 
some of the a cappella groups. While all 
beatboxers hyped up the crowd, the fan 
favorites were from the Songburghs and 
Pitch Please.
While Carnegie Mellon’s groups are 
near and dear to our hearts and fought 
valiantly, unfortunately the University 
of Pittsburgh came out on top. With 
C Flat Run winning in the outstanding 
soloist, outstanding arrangement, and 
outstanding choreography categories, it 
was pretty clear before the results were 
announced which group the judges liked 
best. Carnegie Mellon Treblemaker Derek 
Brown, however, deservedly won the 
award for outstanding vocal percussion. 
Two University of Pittsburgh teams will 
move onto the semifinals in late March: 
the Quarterfinal champions, C Flat Run, 
and the runner-up, the Songburghs (who 
tied for best choreography). While it was 
disappointing to not see Carnegie Mellon 
teams move on to the next round, the 
ICCA Central Quarterfinal was overall 
a major success and an exciting event 
to attend, with immensely talented sing-
ers and vocal percussionists across the 
board.

“Warholian Garage Rock. Surf Rockcandy. 
Your favorite band’s favorite band.”
Meet *repeat repeat, a Nashville-based 
band presenting a swirl of grunge rock and 
California surf pop.
The husband-and-wife duo Jared and Kristyn 
Corder released their first album Bad Latitude 
in 2014, and are back with their sophomore 
release Floral Canyon. Aiming to mix the 
steely close-harmonies of 1960-70s California 
pop with New York’s edgy punk rock, the 
band has something to offer to any music 
lover.
While their previous album Bad Latitude spoke 
on the experiences of the duo’s engagement, 
Floral Canyon reflects a number of the band’s 
experiences. From the sunny beginning of new 
love to the tumultuous nature of relationships, 
the album creates a blend of “bloom, doom, 
and boom.” Their debut single for the album, 
“Girlfriend,”perfectly represents this sound: it’s 
a loud and crashy song about sweet love.
Here to talk more about the about themselves 
and the album is *repeat repeat. Jared’s 
responses will be represented by a “J” and 
Kristyn’s will be represented by a “K”.
I read in another article that your band name 
“*repeat repeat” came from a shampoo bot-
tle! Could you talk a little bit more about your 
inspiration for the name?
J: Coming up with a solid band name is tough 
now! Once you think of something that in your 
mind is unique, a simple Google search will 
leave you feeling unoriginal. 
I saw the shampoo bottle, and it included the 
punctuation *repeat, repeat. So in the begin-
nings of the band, we used the asterisk & the 
comma. Two punctuation marks in a band 
name was too much. We almost immediately 
dropped the comma and kept the asterisk. It 
inadvertently works in our favor in show list-
ings because we often get listed first, although 
that wasn’t the goal.
How do you want *repeat repeat to stand out 
from the music scene?
J: Kristyn (my wife and bandmate) always 
reminds me that in this business “there’s room 
for everybody,” and I think about that a lot. 
I’m not too concerned with standing out as 
much as I am with being at the same table as 
the bands I love. I do think what sets us apart 
is our love for each other, our never ending 
hard work and willingness to eat sleep and 
breathe the music and all the moving parts 
behind it — and making music that is unpreten-
tious tells a story and is relatable.
This idea of “blending opposites” is evident in 
your musical style: it’s a swirl of grunge/rock 
and California surf pop. Has this idea emerged 
in other aspects of this album or your music in 
general?
K: I think we came by that juxtaposition 
naturally. Even if I don’t directly intend to, I 
think I usually bring the retro vibe and that’s 
because it will always be my favorite style of 8

---------------------------------------------------

music (and clothes, and art...) so I can’t escape 
it, and because we both have strong ties to 
California culture - Jared was born there, and I 
spent almost 10 years living there myself besides 
having a big family from there and visiting often 
(from Texas, where my dad had moved by the 
time I was born). We love the harmony-heavy, 
surf-inspired sound but can’t live without loud, 
crunchy guitars and a little bit of spookiness. 
The irony is we definitely consider ourselves an 
East Coast band and have come up as a band 
entirely on the East Coast... So go figure.
What is it about the 1960-70s aesthetic that 
inspires you?
K: My dad was from a family of seven siblings 
in Long Beach, California. He and his brothers 
were typical SoCal surfers of the 1960s — up 
at dawn surfing before school started — listen-
ing to The Mamas and the Papas, The Beach 
Boys, Everly Brothers — but also bands like The 
Beatles, The Kinks, and others from the U.K. 
He taught me to have a deep appreciation for 
that era and style of music, and from there the 
rest followed. The Beatles’ girlfriends/wives and 
Carnaby Street fashion models were my muses. 
The color palettes are so, um, groovy. I’ve 
always loved sixties style, and the analog often 
psychedelic sounds, and the loud, colorful art. 
That beachy, harmony driven surf-inspired pop 
sound — and the London / New York City mod 
or Britpop culture blend together in a way that I 
find basically irresistible.
That overall aesthetic and peace/love/sunshine 
vibe has always been a big part of who I am 
and I think Jared could get into it and see 
why when we met and started dating. He had 
a latent retro rock quality to him being from 
the West coast himself, listening to bands like 
Weezer and Green Day — but he wasn’t raised 
on the music that came before his own time 
which I had almost entirely been raised on, so 
we had to unearth the influences of his influenc-
es a little bit before we found our own sound.
How does Floral Canyon differentiate from your 
debut album Bad Latitude? (In terms of goal/
message, working with a label, etc.) Were there 
other album titles you were considering?
J: Bad Latitude was my love-tribute to meet-
ing Kristyn. I wrote it when we started dating, 
through our wedding, so each song is about 
a piece of my life intertwining with hers. With 
Floral Canyon we knew two things were certain 
before making the record: that we would touch 
on more themes and allow ourselves to write 
about other aspects of life than we had on our 
first album, and that it would be called “Floral 
Canyon” (haha). We had that name picked 
out a year before we wrote the record. Floral 
Canyon was the beginning of a transition for 
me and my songwriting where I started writing 
songs that I felt had a deep meaning to me but 
also could be relatable in many ways to the lis-
tener.
Your website features the phrase, “*repeat 
repeat creates their own geography to match 
their sound.” Considering that Floral Canyon is 
a play on California’s Laurel Canyon, what about 
these locations (CA, NY, or Nashville) inspired 
you to create your own space within the music 
community?
J: Indie rock coming out of Nashville had its 
own distinct sound when we were making the 
record. Bands like The Black Keys, Jack White, 
Jeff the Brotherhood, and Bully all culminated in 
a feverish lo-fi urgency that we wanted to take 
apart and make our own. We are also obsessed 
with the 1960s mod culture of New York style 
and the Warholian era, so we wanted to cap-
ture that style and mysticism in our own music. 
Kristyn’s inherited upbringing in the surf sounds 
of California made big beachy harmonies inevi-
table. Our music at it’s best is an amalgam of all 
of those styles and nostalgic vibes.
What is your fondest memory of the making of 
this album?
J: The last day in the studio, we had to touch up 
a few vocal tracks. We had just done 16 songs 
in two weeks and were exhausted. We got sick 
the night before and sang on the tracks with 
a cold. Our vocals, being relaxed, slow, gave 
the notes we were singing more of a groovy 
feel. It sounded great on the recordings. So the 
producer and engineer ended up having us sing 
every song on every track over again in that 
one day. They ended up being our best vocal 
takes. Sometimes those things just work out in a 
funny way.
How are you feeling about this tour and being 
able to perform at huge festivals like South by 
Southwest (SWSX) and Bonnaroo?
K: We feel prepared, and excited to continue 
supporting the new album since it came out right 
before the Winter hibernation. It feels like a 
complete dream to be playing the festivals we 
have coming up! And honestly, it even still feels 
like a dream to have played Forecastle, Firefly, 
and SXSW last year now that I think about it. 
Bonnaroo being our “hometown festival” and 
feeling like we’ve grown up in its shadow and 
are now playing is a feeling that I can only 
describe as surreal and greatful. 
We’re pumped to go back to SXSW - we had a 
great time last year and it always leaves us with 
a feeling of accomplishment (and exhaustion!). 
Shaky Knees we are thrilled for because the 
lineup is right up our alley and our favorite band 
is playing (Alvvays), so we are playing and then 
hanging out for the weekend and staying at one 
of our favorite hotels in the country. 
Sloss Fest in Birmingham is a personal favorite 
of ours for really a whole list of reasons, starting 
with the branding and design, to the lineup, to 
the “old factory” location, and they are super 
sweet and supportive to bands online, which 
always feels warm and fuzzy. We can’t wait and 
hope the festivals keep coming.
What’s coming up for the band that you’re most 
excited about?
J: Lots of touring, even more festivals. 
Bonnaroo, Shaky Knees in Atlanta, Sloss Fest in 
Birmingham. We’re putting out another single at 
the end of March and going back in the studio 
this winter to work on LP 3. I’m most excited 
about the news songs I have been writing, evolv-
ing our sound with this next record, and some 
surprises we have planned for our Bonnaroo set.
And, lastly, a question for personal curiosity: 
what’s it like to live with 11 animals?
K: Haaa. It’s the best! Oh man, they are a trip. 
There is a seamlessness that our crew has that 
almost makes them like a pack, so they work 
with and around each other (and the near-
constant Roomba) with love and respect. Cats 
snuggle dogs, the parrot tells us all what to do 
and when to do it. They are all rescues and 
several of them have crazy backstories and/
or special needs. I have always had horses 
since I was a child so we have an adopted ex-
racehorse whom we adore - and between his 
incredible care facility that is top-notch and our 
amazing beloved friends that take over the col-
lective love-fest that is the other 10 in the house 
— when we tour, we truly owe them the world! 
It takes patience, cleanliness, Amazon Prime, 
and an inability to see yourself doing life in any 
other way.
For those interested, *repeat repeat will be on 
tour this spring/summer, coming to Pittsburgh’s 
Club Cafe on Friday, March 9.
As for me, I’ll be listening to Floral Canyon on 
*repeat repeat.

---------------------------------------------------

Saturdays are perfect for brunch. After a tiring 
week of classes, assignments, and responsibilities, 
we’ve finally reached the best day of the week. 
Though I always regret it, I always push off my 
homework until Sunday, and I know I’m not alone. 
It’s not uncommon to find me still in bed, late into 
the afternoon (I have no shame about this).
But I think I’ve found a place that’s worth getting 
up (relatively) early on a Saturday for brunch. 
Geppetto Café is a quaint little place on Butler 
Street in Lawrenceville. The 93 bus will take 
you straight there on weekdays, but it’s a little 
harder to get to on weekends. The 93 doesn’t 
run on weekends, which are the most common 
times college students will have brunch. But like 
getting up early, the trip via the 54 bus and a little 
walking is well worth it.
From the outside, the café doesn’t look like much, 
a small hole in the wall with a gray sign. But, 
the sign also displays its logo: a hand holding a 
marionette, wires holding up a cup of coffee with 
the café’s name on it. The moment I entered, 
my mind jogged back to childhood memories of 
Disney movies, specifically Pinocchio, created by 
woodcarver Geppetto.
The interior is whimsical. There are several things

hanging from the ceiling. In one section, books 
are suspended from strings. In another, small 
colorful umbrellas hang over customers enjoying 
a meal. Above the main counter, the lights are 
encased in mason jars. Against the simple white-
painted brick wall are miniature wooden puppets 
— Pinocchios.
The menu is made up of American breakfast 
meals with European influences: crêpes from 
France, waffles from Belgium, and paninis from 
Italy. They have a wide selection of savory crêpes, 
with a range of choices for different tastes in 
cheese, vegetables, and meats. On the sweet 
side, entrees are available as crêpes or waffles, 
made with a variety of fruits and syrups topped 
with whipped cream. The menu also offers French 
toast, paninis, and salads.
My friend and I were in the mood for crêpes and 
decided to try one savory and one sweet, and split 
them. For the savory, we settled on the Love Hate 
Thing, made with smoked turkey, goat cheese, 
avocado, and béchamel sauce. For the sweet, we 
chose the Merry Berry, made with Nutella and 
fresh strawberries.
The savory crêpe was delicious, with the cheese 
and avocado blending well but not overpowering 
the mellow flavor of the turkey. I’d never had a 
crêpe with avocado, and it was a nice surprise. 
Savory crêpes also come with a simple side salad 
with a light vinaigrette, which went well with the 
crêpe.
There’s not much to say about the sweet crêpe: 
you can’t go wrong with Nutella and strawberries, 
and whipped cream on top of that. It was the 
breakfast to the savory crêpe’s lunch. Both crêpes 
themselves were thin and delicate, fried with a 
nice crisp finish.
I can say that they were easily the best crêpes I’ve 
had in Pittsburgh. The service was quick and non-
intrusive, and the place is relatively affordable for 
Lawrenceville and for crêpes. However, it gets busy 
very quickly, especially on Saturdays. We arrived 
at 10 a.m., only an hour after opening, and it was 
already very crowded. By the time we left before 
noon, the place was packed. Go early, or be 
prepared to wait a couple minutes for a table.
In my second year at Carnegie Mellon, I’ve been 
branching out of the typical Oakland and Squirrel 
Hill food options, trying places in East Liberty, 
the Strip District, and of course, Lawrenceville. 
Geppetto Café has definitely been added as my 
go-to brunch restaurant of choice.
